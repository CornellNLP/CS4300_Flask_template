That\u2019s why we want to raise awareness of one of the most fantastic projects of our time: the American Prairie Reserve in northeastern Montana. This is an amazing effort to assemble the largest wildlife reserve in the lower 48 states. When stepping onto the plains of American Prairie Reserve, it\u2019s easy to imagine the landscape as Lewis and Clark and Native Americans saw it, with thundering herds of bison, racing bands of pronghorn antelope and prairie dog towns dotting the horizon. When complete, the Reserve will be approximately 5,000 square miles; larger than Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Grand Teton National Parks combined. Go to americanprairie.org to learn how to visit and support this worthy cause. Capable of running at speeds up to 55 miles per hour, the pronghorn Antelope is North America\u2019s fastest land mammal and performs the continent\u2019s second longest land migration of more than 500 miles. Because of their love of travel, pronghorn require large areas of open and intact grasslands. Moreover, pronghorn populations have decreased 98% since the 1800\u2019s due to habitat destruction. American Prairie Reserve helps pronghorn through its ongoing fence removal efforts and by conserving wildlife corridors. Our American Prairie is a carefully crafted blend of straight bourbons at least 2 years old, (sourced whiskeys, see highwest.com for details) making a great sipper and thoughtful person\u2019s whiskey. High West pledges to donate 10% of our after tax profits from the sale of this bottle to the American Prairie Reserve. Be thoughtful and help us protect and preserve America\u2019s natural resources.

A Maryland transplant unafraid to stand out amidst the residing establishment, Basil conjectured that the spicy flavor of rye would be a striking complement to the sweet smoothness of corn in his distillery's standard bourbon. And much to the chagrin of the traditionalist set, Basil was right. His recipe was a masterpiece, resulting in a unique, singular small batch bourbon whiskey that was blessed with rich hints of peppermint, notes of pepper, slight citrus overtones, and a spicy, warming finish. Artfully aged at a relatively mild 80 proof, Basil Hayden's\u00a0is as novel and delectable a bourbon whiskey as it was when the master distiller rolled out his first barrel over 200 years ago. Marked by a rich cascade of aromas and flavors, Basil Hayden's\u00a0is still a small batch bourbon, but with broader appeal.

To put it short and simple: Absolut Citron is smooth and mellow, with a fresh fruity lemon and lime character and a note of lemon peel. The Absolut way of making vodka In 1879, Lars Olsson Smith introduced the continuous distillation with which he made Absolut Rent Br\u00e4nvin. Instead of the usual three or four times, the vodka was distilled an infinite number of times. Absolut Citron is made the same way, the only difference is the taste of lemon. And, like the rest of the family, it\u2019s produced in \u00c5hus, L.O. Smith\u2019s birth town. Since the process will never change, neither will the true taste of Absolut Citron. Keeping natural ingredients natural The main ingredients in Absolut Citron are Absolut Vodka and citrus flavor. Absolut Vodka is made from water and winter wheat. The water comes from a deep well in \u00c5hus where it\u2019s protected from impurities. The winter wheat is also grown in \u00c5hus and differs from other crops: it\u2019s sown one fall, and harvested the next one. Days in between it grows under the Swedish snow developing its hard grain. Also, the use of fertilizers is minimized. Though lemon is the main flavor, lime is also added to give Absolut Citron its perfect character.", "rating": null, "origin": "Sweden", "type": "Vodka", "url": "https://www.theliquorstorejacksonhole.com/spirits/Absolut-Absolut-Citron-Vodka-w33982430p"},

Home-brewer Chad Brown was talking malt with his cousin Gene Purdy, a farmer. Wyoming had a burgeoning craft beer and spirits scene, but the cost of shipping malt was high. They asked, What if Wyoming spirits could be made with grain straight from local farms? Together and with their Aunt, Kathy Brown, they answered that question by founding the Wyoming Malting Company and Pine Bluffs Distilling. The mission: distill and distribute premium local spirits so everyone\u2014in Wyoming and beyond\u2014can taste the farm-to-distillery difference. Trained in distilling at Moonshine University in Kentucky, Erica Unruh is the talent behind the equipment.

An Irish whiskey as uncommon as its surroundings and colourful history, each drop presents an opportunity to uncover yet another subtle layer of its full bodied character. Crafted with enduring passion, each stage of our signature triple casked aging process adds to its warm golden hue, alluring aroma and remarkable taste. Malt, toasted grain and malt whiskeys are blended and matured in virgin oak casks, seasoned whiskey casks and Oloroso sherry casks to develop an inimitable complexity. Strong hints of vanilla on the nose follow with a smooth but full bodied mouthfeel that yields notes of Demerara sugar and ripe banana with bursts of rich caramel, vanilla and butterscotch. The whiskey finishes with lingering hints of dried fruit and delicate brown or baking spice. Masterfully blended and aged to perfection, Slane Irish Whiskey is a true reflection of our unique provenance and processes. This is an exceptional Irish whiskey for those living the stories that will be told for generations to come.
