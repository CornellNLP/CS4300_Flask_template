{"name": "Alabama Slammer", "base": "vodka", "description": "The Alabama Slammer has a short history, though both this highball and the shooter of the same name were hits at the bar from the 1970s through the '80s. They were popular among the college crowds of the time, particularly at the University of Alabama where the drinks supposedly originated. Which came first, the shot or the tall drink? It's hard to tell, but the shot may very well have been first. Either way, the Alabama Slammer does have a strong correlation with Alabama's Crimson Tide football team. The ingredients are the same in both Alabama Slammers, though in this mixed drink there is substantially more orange juice. The Southern Comfort (popularly just called SoCo) adds an apricot-peachy flavor that mixes well with the amaretto and sloe gin. Admittedly, the Alabama Slammer is not as popular today as it was a few decades ago. It was created during a time when bartenders were mixing up some very strong, very sweet drinks. Even the SoCo and sloe gin used here are not used as much today as they once were. It is a good throwback drink and fun to share with friends.", "rating": "4.5", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/alabama-slammer-recipe-760990"},
{"name": "Bay Breeze", "base": "vodka", "description": "The bay breeze is a simple mixed drink that brings the tropical taste of pineapple into the popular mix of vodka and cranberry. It is an easy, delicious, and refreshing drink that can be mixed up in a minute and is a cocktail recipe that every bartender should know. Fortunately, it's incredibly easy to memorize! Like the other \"duo\" and \"trio\" drinks that mix vodka with fruit juice, the bay breeze (also called a Hawaiian sea breeze or a downeaster) is an uncomplicated highball recipe. It requires your favorite vodka and equal parts of cranberry and pineapple juices to fill the glass. Despite its simplicity, the bay breeze packs a flavorful punch and is a fun everyday drink. There are also a number of options for giving it a quick twist.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/bay-breeze-recipe-761000"},
{"name": "Beachcomber", "base": "rum", "description": "The beachcomber is a fun and simple rum cocktail that offers an interesting mix of flavors which are most enjoyable on summer evenings. This drink is best described as a maraschino-flavored daiquiri. Despite only using a small amount of maraschino liqueur, the dry cherry taste comes to the forefront of this otherwise transparent drink, giving it a nice, lively touch. This recipe is a close adaptation of the original beachcomber as printed in \"Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide\" (1947). That recipe called for the drink to be \u200bblended with 1 cup of ice. Whether shaken or frozen, it's hard to deny that is a great drink.", "rating": "3", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/beachcomber-cocktail-recipe-759281"},
{"name": "Blood & Sand", "base": "whiskey", "description": "The Blood and Sand is one of the few Scotch cocktails that should be considered a classic. The complete history is somewhat shaky, but it is accepted that it was inspired by the movie Blood and Sand. The original film was produced in 1922 (starring Rudolph Valentino) and was remade in 1941 (starring Tyrone Powers) and again in 1989 (with Sharon Stone). The cocktail is a beautiful one with a touch of sweet citrus. Cherry Heering is a great substitution for the brandy because it has a more natural cherry flavor than many of today's cherry brandies. Also, fresh-squeezed orange juice is definitely recommended.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/blood-and-sand-cocktail-recipe-761336"},
{"name": "Black & Tan", "base": "beer", "description": "Can't decide which style of beer to enjoy tonight? Enjoy two completely different brews in the same glass with the popular black and tan. This is the layered beer drink that you can see poured in bars across the United States, and it's very easy to make at home.  While some may think the name of this drink refers to Irish politics, we can assure you that it is not. The name is derived from the two beers that it requires: a pale ale (like Bass Ale, Boulevard, or Sierra Nevada) at the bottom and Guinness Stout (or a similar dark stout) on the top. These two beers make perfect \"black and tan\" layers in the glass if they're poured correctly. As you drink it, you'll find the two layers remain separated and that the finish is the complete opposite of the first drink. The black and tan has transformed modern bar taps, which are now often decorated with a \"black and tan spoon.\" As you will see, the spoon is the key to creating the layers of this and similar beer drinks.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/black-and-tan-cocktail-recipe-759593"},
{"name": "Bellini", "base": "Champagne", "description": "The Bellini is a popular sparkling wine cocktail with a delightful peachy flavor. It's a very easy recipe and a lot of fun to share, especially when you have a few friends over for brunch cocktails. It makes a nice dinner drink, too. This cocktail was created in 1948 at Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy by bartender Giuseppe Cipriani. It was named after the Italian Renaissance painter Giovanni Bellini. Supposedly, the drink's color reminded Cipriani of the painter's preferred warm and subdued color palette. Originally, the Bellini used Prosecco and it is still made that way in Italy. Elsewhere, it's often made with Champagne, which tends to be drier (unless you choose a sec or demi-sec wine). Any sparkling wine will do, though. For the peach flavor, a pur\u00e9e of fresh white peaches is best and traditional; out of season, canned peaches will work. But again, there are other options so you can choose whatever's easiest for you.", "rating": "4.5", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/bellini-cocktail-recipe-759283"},
{"name": "Black & Blue", "base": "beer", "description": "The black and blue beer drink is a brand-specific variation of the black and tan. Instead of a pale ale, Blue Moon is the layer underneath the Guinness. It's very easy to make and one of the best layered beer drinks for beginners. Blue Moon is a very well-known Belgian-style witbier (wheat beer) that has a refreshing citrus note and is highly effervescent, which is why it's a popular choice for summer. That is a complete contrast to the dark, dry Irish stout. If you've been looking for a way to enjoy Guinness on hot days, this is definitely a good option and the way the two beers marry in those middle sips is a very nice surprise.", "rating": "4.5", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/black-and-blue-recipe-759592"},
{"name": "Black Russian", "base": "vodka", "description": "When it comes to simple and satisfying cocktails, few can beat the black Russian. This popular lowball is enjoyed worldwide and the combination of vodka with a coffee liqueur creates a pleasant and irresistible drink. The black Russian is so well-known that it should be among the first cocktails that every aspiring bartender commits to memory. While you're at it, be sure to learn how to make the white Russian as well. There is not much to the black Russian recipe and it's on of those incredibly easy drinks that anyone can mix up. You will simply pour your favorite vodka and coffee liqueur (typically Kahlua) over ice, stir, and serve.

{"name": "Bee's Knees", "base": "gin", "description": "The Bee's Knees is a fun and very easy cocktail from the Prohibition era. Some stories claim that the drink was concocted because the honey masked the odor of the liquor. While that may be the case, one has to wonder if it really did the trick given some of the stories about the often pungent bathtub gins circulating during that time. None the less, with today's variety of gins, the Bee's Knees is a delightful cocktail that you can experiment with. A London dry gin will create a completely different profile than one of the new American-style gins. Each gin has their own blend of botanicals that will be accented quite nicely with the lemon and honey, so it's a different experience with every drink.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/bees-knees-cocktail-recipe-760010"},

It's time to introduce yourself to the delicious batida (ba-chee-dah). This is a popular drink in Brazil that is most often made with cachaca, fruit, milk, and sugar. Batidas can be blended or shaken then served over crushed ice. Passionfruit is one of the most popular batida flavors; in Portuguese it is called batida de maracuja. This recipe from Novo Fogo Cachaca is a fantastic introduction to the delicious taste of the batida and it is very easy to make. This batida recipe is simple. It pairs Novo Fogo's fine cacha\u00e7as with passionfruit syrup so there's no need to wait for passionfruit season or mess around with the fruit's pulp.

It's an excellent classic drink that's a little sweet and a little sour and designed for this specific brand of rum. The Bacardi cocktail happens to be one of the earliest examples of really good liquor advertising campaigns. In fact, in 1936 the New York Supreme Court ruled that an authentic Bacardi cocktail (even beyond this recipe) had to be made with Bacardi Rum. Nonetheless, this is a fun drink and it's pretty good, too.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/bacardi-cocktail-recipe-759282"},
{"name": "April Rain", "base": "vodka", "description": "Bright, refreshing, and just slightly dry, the April rain is a wonderful cocktail that's sure to put you in a spring mood. It's a simple variation on the vodka martini that gives the popular cocktail a lime twist. What is nice about this recipe is that it has a drier profile than other lime-flavored martinis. The only sweetness comes from the lime juice, which simultaneously adds a little sour to the drink. It's uplifting and a nice change from the sweet, fruity vodka martinis that are so popular. You'll find that the April rain makes an excellent dinner cocktail. Enjoy one before the meal as an aperitif or with dinner as it's a delightful palate cleanser for any type of food, even spicy dishes.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/april-rain-cocktail-recipe-759580"},
{"name": "Angel's Delight", "base": "gin", "description": "The angel's delight is a wonderful dessert cocktail to serve at a dinner party. It's an unusual gin cocktail in that it uses triple sec and cream. And that pretty pink color comes from a hint of grenadine, which adds to the sweetness. Surprisingly, all of that works very well when it comes together. While it's definitely not the typical flavor profile for gin, the spirit's botanicals are rather nice against the creamy fruit taste. Just be sure not to overdo it on the cream. A little too much can throw off the drink's balance.", "rating": "5", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/angels-delight-cocktail-recipe-759280"},

It's easy to make at home and one taste will instantly transport you to a faraway tropical beach. The Bahama Mama is a very popular cocktail and, just like many tiki drinks, there are many recipes available. You should expect two types of rum, a little coconut and coffee, and a healthy dose of pineapple. While those are the keys to any good Bahama Mama, from there various ingredients are added. For example, the first recipe is one of the more basic and common ways to make this drink. It has all the essential ingredients with an accent of lemon juice. The second recipe adds orange juice and grenadine, creating a slightly sweeter mix. Both drinks are delicious, they simply show the range that you can find in the Bahama Mamas of the world. The Bahama Mama you order at your local tiki lounge may be entirely different than the one you had on your Caribbean vacation.

{"name": "Aura In Me", "base": "gin", "description": "The best way to describe the \"aura in me\" cocktail is sweetly spiced elegance. It is a beautiful genever cocktail that offers a unique drinking experience and it's a fantastic example of modern mixology using an Old World gin. This recipe comes from Christos Bafas, a bartender specializing in fusion cocktails in Santorini, Greece. The drink is actually rather simple, but it is unique in the flavor combination because it employs a few ingredients that are not found in the average cocktail. Its foundation is made of the always lovely Bols Genever, which is accented by fresh lemon juice, a little elderflower syrup, and pine honey. The egg adds that silky foam that makes so many classic and modern drinks spectacular, and then there is the spice. Muddling pink peppercorns and cardamom seeds gives the drink an unusual background flavor that is intriguing and sure to tantalize your taste buds.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/aura-in-me-cocktail-recipe-759122"},
{"name": "Angel's Tit", "base": "chocolate", "description": "The angel's tit is a classic example of a pousse-caf\u00e9, a category of multi-layered drinks that are as beautiful as they are delicious. The drinks are predecessors to today's myriad of layered shots and the popular B-52 shooter started out in a pousse-caf\u00e9 glass. They're amazing dessert cocktails, often offering indulgent flavors like the chocolate, cherry, and cream seen in this cocktail. This particular recipe comes from the Prohibition era of the 1930s, when it was known as the angel's tip. According to Gary \"Gaz\" Regan's book, \"The Joy of Mixology,\" it was also called the witch's tit by some. Whatever you call it, the cocktail's name likely came from the look of the finished cocktail: a creamy mountain topped with a cherry in exactly the right place.

{"name": "Zombie Punch", "base": "rum", "description": "The zombie punch is a popular tiki drink with many variations that have come and gone over time. It's a fun name that has often been used for any heavily spiked, fruit-filled rum drink. This recipe is for the classic 1934 zombie punch, which was unearthed by Jeff \"Beachbum\" Berry. It comes from the private collection of Don (Beach) the Beachcomber, one of the founders of the tiki cocktail culture. Beach was a man known for guarding his recipes very well and Berry wrote about this one in his 2007 book \"Sippin' Safari.\" You will notice that this is not a \"punch\" in the modern sense. Instead of a large batch made to serve many guests at a party, it is a classically-styled punch served by the glass. In this context, \"punch\" refers to a fruity cocktail that is filled with an array of flavors. The zombie punch is fascinating, with its combination of citrus, herbs, spices, and sweet grenadine. On top of all that, there are three different styles of rum! Everything is mixed in a blender to create a frozen cocktail that you will not forget anytime soon.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/zombie-punch-recipe-759868"},

The taste is not exactly the same, but it is a fun vodka with a sugary fruit flavor. In this cocktail, Tartz is simply mixed with triple sec and lemonade to create an easy and refreshing drink. It is perfect for casual and last-minute parties, especially those in summer when we often crave fresh lemonade.

If you are familiar with the rusty nail, you will be pleasantly surprised by how well the herbal honey liqueur pairs with scotch's Irish counterpart. In true sour fashion, the Irish whiskey and Drambuie combination are accented with citrus\u2014in this case, triple sec and lemon juice. Finishing it off with a splash of ginger ale brings all those flavors together while adding just a hint of sparkle.

As is common in tiki-style cocktails, the yellow bird uses both a light rum and a dark rum. A touch of Galliano (the anise and vanilla liqueur) is added to bring in another layer of flavor and make things a bit more interesting. It's a fabulous flavor combination and you'll enjoy every sip of it. No matter how you make it, the yellow bird makes a great summertime cocktail.

You'll simply pour dark rum, dry vermouth, and pineapple juice in equal amounts. It creates a wonderful drink that's slightly drier than the average rum cocktail, a perfect venue for the bright fruit flavor. While it's customarily shaken, this is also a great mix for the blender.

Hiding behind Midori's green color and pineapple's tropical aroma is a little absinthe. It can be unexpected, tossing that anise punch in right at the end. This is a fun one to watch your friends knock back, especially if they don't see you grab the absinthe bottle. The Wolf Bite also includes a cool visual effect. The last step in its construction is a drizzle of grenadine.

What I found most interesting is the use of fresh fruit and a spiced liqueur to add a seasonal flair to the average Sangria recipe. The red wine base is there, but it also includes Jagermeister Spice with PAMA and fresh cranberries and pomegranate. It is a punch you can only pull off in fall and winter because of the seasonality of those fruits.

The recipe pairs the herbal power of Jagermeister with vodka, which helps smooth out the somewhat notorious liqueur. Adding a coffee liqueur gives the drink a nice dimension while the grenadine brings in a bit of sweetness. Overall, it's an inviting taste and a recipe you'll likely come back to again.

These additions take some of the \"egginess\" out of the eggnog, making it a very approachable drink. The nice part about this cocktail is the timing. Many liquor stores will stock a specialty liqueur like white chocolate specifically for the holidays. Look around and see what you can find or ask if they plan to get a suitable option in stock before Christmas. The most important ingredient in this drink is, of course, the eggnog. It is very easy to make from scratch and can be made a few different ways. The quickest way is how eggnog is made in many bars around the holidays. It simply involves milk, syrup, and egg yolk. You can even add the Southern Comfort and chocolate liqueur in the shaker and skip the full 4 ounces of eggnog this recipe calls for. The other option will create a large batch of an eggnog base that you can use in this recipe. It requires a little more work but is nice to have in the refrigerator and it's a great way to serve the white Christmas to guests. Simply use this homemade eggnog recipe and skip the brandy. This recipe is a nice way to spice up store-bought eggnog as well, so there's no need to make it from scratch. It's best to use well-chilled eggnog and, if you want, you can also add a few ice cubes to cool and water it down just a little.

It's difficult to track down the original recipe, though the essentials are usually the same: whiskey, citrus, and grenadine.

However, if you are adventurous, give the original one try. In the recipe, I have taken it even further and used the absinthe as a rinse that gently coats the glass.

Eggnog, on the other hand, is cold and already mixed and ready to drink. The Tom &amp; Jerry is, however, a fantastic alternative to eggnog and many drinkers prefer it because it is more of a warm milk punch and has less of an \"eggy\" flavor.

It also adds an extra splash of tropical, tart fruit flavor along with the sweetness of ginger ale. To say that it's refreshing is an understatement, which is why it's a fabulous cocktail for summer. The primary difference between the shiso mojito and the classic mojito is that it uses shiso in place of mint. Shiso, or perilla, is a herb in the mint family that is primarily used in Japanese cuisine. There are two types of shiso, red and green. Aojiso (also called Japanese basil) is the green variety and preferred in this recipe. It is a little difficult to describe, but you will find that shiso does not have the mint or basil flavor that you might expect from the herb. Instead, it has more of an anise, citrus, and cinnamon taste\u2014a sort of blended herbal spice flavor. Some people compare the red variety (akajiso) to a light basil flavor while some recipes suggest parsley as a substitute when shiso cannot be found. That unique taste definitely makes an interesting cocktail. If you're planning a dinner with any variety of Japanese dishes, this is a great drink to serve your guests.

The screaming viking is one of those drinks that didn't exist until a TV character ordered it, exactly like the Flaming Homer/Moe. In this instance, it was the first episode of the sixth season of \"Cheers\" and the drink was created as a prank. The plot is that Sam Malone wanted to win his job back after selling the bar. The new bartender, Wayne, claimed to know every drink ever made, but he was quickly challenged. When Norm walks into the bar (pretending not to be the beer guzzling regular he was) and orders a screaming viking, Wayne is stumped. Woody, on the other hand, knows exactly what to do.  We never actually see the drink being made and there is only the mention of a bruised cucumber. If you look closely, you will see Norm with a neat, semi-clear drink in an old-fashioned glass that is garnished with a cucumber. Somewhere along the way, someone created the following recipe and gave it the screaming viking name. Is it the one Woody mixed up? Probably not... it's TV!

{"name": "Scorpion", "base": "brandy", "description": "The scorpion is a very popular tiki cocktail that is most often served as a punch. It's a classic recipe from the mid-1900s and over the years ingredients were added, subtracted, and multiplied. It is very rare to find two scorpion recipes that are alike. For most scorpions, rum is an essential ingredient and you'll almost always find orange juice and orgeat syrup. You can also serve this punch in a scorpion bowl with a shot of rum flaming in the center like a volcano. The story of the scorpion is that it was a Hawaiian cocktail served with okolehao, a sort of local moonshine. Victor Bergeron, of Trader Vic's fame, enjoyed it on one of his trips to the islands and brought it back to the mainland. In true tiki fashion, rum became the spirit of choice. This recipe comes from \"Trader Vic's Book of Food and Drink\" (1946). Unlike some newer scorpion recipes, just one rum is required. It is filled with interesting flavors and everything in it makes it an iconic tiki cocktail. Bergeron's method for making his scorpion is delightfully simple. Notice how he suggests letting it sit for two hours. This allows for proper dilution and brings the punch's strength down while taming the flavors so it's perfectly enjoyable. Many punch recipes would do well with the same treatment. This recipe should serve about 20 drinks, making it a great party punch. Bergeron suggested garnishing it with a gardenia. However, as Dale DeGroff suggests in \"\u200bThe Essential Cocktail,\" an edible flower, or \"humble slices of orange and lemon and a mint sprig\" will do just fine.

A London dry gin is best with the Salty Dog and this is one of those drinks where you can be a little thrifty. Feel free to use one of the cheaper gins available and save the best gin for your martinis. Grapefruit can be too sour for some tastes.

In this cocktail, it is paired with both varieties of vermouth and two bitters in a sweetened martini-like cocktail that is quite tasty. Whether you enjoy it before or after, there is no dispute that this classic cocktail makes a great dinner drink.  Because it is heavier than the drier martinis, it is a great option for a dessert cocktail and pairs nicely with cheesecake and desserts with a hint of chocolate or fruit. The San Francisco cocktail also makes a nice aperitif, particularly if you are looking for a martini that is lightly alcoholic (those others can be quite hefty). How classic is it?

This brings in a different nuance that only the \"rice wine\" can contribute. Technically, sake is not wine but is more like beer because it is brewed from rice.  Since there are a few styles of sake available, you can explore pairing the options with different gins and vodkas. Each will be a slightly new experience and you may find a preference for one over all the others. Additionally, some saketini recipes add a hint of orange liqueur\u2014typically 1/2 ounce or less\u2014and others invert the main ingredients as seen in the vodka version.

It's a great choice for this drink and pairs wonderfully with the Campari, port, and Prosecco.

The cocktail menu for the Brooklyn bar is filled with drinks that are just as creative as this one and it seems like patrons could never get bored with the specialties of the house. Though it is filled with a couple of unusual ingredients, the Ruby Queen is actually quite easy to mix up. You will need to prepare or acquire fresh beet juice and take a few minutes to make a fresh honey syrup. The surprise comes when you taste just how well a decent Scotch like Cutty Sark works against this sweetened vegetable profile. Most of us would lean toward a more neutral spirit for such adistinct flavor like beets, yet the whisky adds a depth that vodka and gin cannot. Once all of the ingredients are in hand, simply pour and shake like any other drink and you will have a nice, savory drink that will rival (or replace) any Bloody Mary on those occasions when you desire something completely out of the norm.

This martini is great with any of the newer, lighter styles of gin, such as Hendrick's or Aviation, though it's quite enjoyable with dry gins as well. The rose flavor is a nice pairing for gin's botanicals and is obtained by simply using a rose-infused syrup. You can buy it or make rose syrup at home with rose water.

It gives the cocktail the slightest hint of fruity sweetness, which is quite lovely and it makes a wonderful aperitif. You do need to be careful, though. Many of today's \"cherry brandies\" are actually sweetened liqueurs with a vodka base and that was probably not the original intention for this cocktail.

The fruity spice of the whiskey liqueur is combined with other fruity flavors, including orange from blue cura\u00e7ao, a blueberry liqueur, and sloe berries from sloe gin.

{"name": "Purple Haze", "base": "vodka", "description": "The purple haze is a fun and popular mixed drink. It's an easy one to mix up and there are many recipes for you to try. Whether you're in the mood for a refreshing highball, a casual lowball, a fancy martini, or a quick shot, there's a purple haze for you. Essentially, \"purple haze\" is a popular name for a great variety of purple-colored drinks. Typically, the recipes include vodka with a fruit liqueur and possibly a splash of soda. You can also find recipes that contain absinthe or sambuca and some that resembled a purple Long Island Iced Tea. To narrow down your options, we'll stick with four common recipes. This drink even comes with its own soundtrack, so queue up some Jimi Hendrix and let's start mixing. There are not many purple-colored liqueurs in the bar so a little color chemistry is required to get the drink's signature color. In this recipe, we'll add a raspberry liqueur like Chambord to cranberry juice to produce a deep purple. The drink is sometimes called the vampire. This is one of the more pleasant purple haze recipes because it builds on the popular vodka-cranberry base that is the Cape Codder. The liqueur adds a sweetness that intensifies the drink's fruitiness. It's a simple addition that can break up a routine. This one may be a little too sweet for some tastes and you can instantly make it more refreshing by adding a splash of soda. Ginger ale is the perfect option, though almost any clear soda will do the trick.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/purple-haze-vodka-drink-recipes-761198"},

This recipe was created by mixologist Jonathan Pogash for Sobieski Vodka, an impressive and affordable Polish rye-based vodka that's often shortened to just Sobi.

This tropical punch originally featured Tommy Bahama Golden Sun and White Sand Rums. However, the pop culture brand has since gotten out of the rum business. Any white and dark rums will work perfectly with the recipe's concentration of pineapple and orange, so choose your favorite bottles.

The primary plum flavor comes from plum wine (a sweet-sour liqueur that's also called umeshu), a favorite product of Japan that rivals the popularity of sake. It is the perfect complement to a gin as complex as Bulldog and the two bold flavors are lightly accented with Dry Sparkling Lavender Soda.

Many people prefer vodka in this cocktail, but using gin creates a beautifully complex citrus drink. Be sure that you chill your martini glasses for an hour in the refrigerator (or, better yet, the freezer) before you make your orange martinis. Even if you are enjoying this drink in winter, the colder the better. If you don't have access to a freezer or refrigerator, plunge the glasses into an ice bucket for 20 minutes. Or, you can give them a quick chill by adding crushed ice and letting it chill while you are mixing the drink.

In the 1935 book, A.S. Crockett says that the Orange Blossom No. 1 (neat) was likely created by \"some young bridegroom or other who wanted something novel to use at his final stag party.\" It's an interesting commentary and one almost gets the feeling that Crockett was not too fond of the drink.

Building on that, this sour combines one of Jameson's finer Irish whiskeys with elderflower and homemade cinnamon-thyme syrup.

If you are new to or just rediscovering absinthe, this is the cocktail you will want to try. It makes for a nice tasting experience and offers the distinct taste of the anise-flavored spirit without it being the lone flavor. The gin and vermouth add their own botanicals to the mix, which helps make absinthe more approachable to a variety of drinkers.

This grog dates to the mid-1700s and was typically a mix of rum, water, honey or molasses, lemon, and cinnamon. It was served either hot or cold. The Navy grog recipes that are most familiar today stem from the tiki movement, which began in the 1940s. It is said that Don Beach was the first to mix it up.

Once you've chosen the rum, it's time to decide which version of hot chocolate to make. A cocoa mix provides a quick option, but old-fashioned hot chocolate results in a richer chocolate base.

The recipe is extremely easy, creating a lime-flavored margarita jello shot (use any flavor gelatin you like). It's almost as simple as adding booze to the mix while you're making gelatin. Yet, there are a few tricks to making jello shots. Most important of those is to keep the alcohol in check so the gelatin can set up. If you pour too much tequila, you will have a sloppy mess.

Many other drinks have proven that you don't always need a chocolate ingredient to make it taste like chocolate. The Chocolate Cake shooter is a perfect example and this M&amp;M shot is yet another case. The amaretto and coffee liqueurs do combine to create a flavor very close to chocolate.

This was one of the signature cocktails from the Brown Derby in Hollywood, California. It was probably featured alongside other 1930s legends of that famous bar, like the Honolulu cocktail, though the drink is actually dated to before Prohibition. The recipe was first printed in a 1916 bartending guide by Hugo Ensslin, quite plainly titled \"Recipes for Mixed Drinks.\" Over the years, the recommended apple brandy has flipped from applejack to calvados and either is fine. You'll also find variations that prefer triple sec, though cura\u00e7ao is a drier orange liqueur, which really is a necessary element against the other sweet ingredients. Along with a little lemon, Benedictine is the undisputed ingredient, bringing its high-proof punch of herbal goodness to the mix.

Surprisingly, it works very well, so you'll just have to give it a try and find out for yourself! Drambuie is the scotch-based liqueur that's flavored with honey, herbs, and spices. It's most often associated with dark cocktails like the rusty nail, though it's fantastic in a bright citrus mix like this. And, you don't want to pair that with the average orange liqueur. To match Drambuie's quality, go with the cognac-based Grand Marnier or a high-end triple sec such as Cointreau or Combier. With all of these high-class additions to the average margarita, one can only expect that a cheap tequila will bring it all down. To avoid this sad predicament find a nice blanco or reposado tequila.

The sweeter citrus is paired in the drink with fresh habanero pepper in a puree that is easy to make ahead of time. From there, the drink uses a smooth tequila and (a preferably homemade) sour mix. The cocktail's finishing touch is a mole negro rim (which you'll actually add before mixing) to give the margarita a spiced dark chocolate accent. Using a prepared mole sauce, such as Do\u00f1a Maria Mexican Mole Sauce, makes this addition quick and easy.

The goal is to cut the longest lemon spiral you can and that can be a challenge. Yet, it is a good excuse to work on a basic bartending skill. The drink itself is, quite simply, bourbon and ginger ale with bitters.

The flavor infusion begins within the first minute and will only intensify the longer it sets. The drink doesn't get as hot as you may expect, though.

When you pour Irish whiskey, you'll have a drink called the Irish buck. There are some versions of the highball recipe that use plain soda water, but ginger ale is the most common mixer used. The soda's sweet and snappy flavor is a nice accent to whiskey and each ginger ale is a little different. Between the two ingredients, you can create a nearly endless array of tastes, which is one of the reasons it's so popular.

Biographical books like Hemingway's own \"A Moveable Feast\" include countless tales of sharing drinks with literary friends while in Paris and much of his free time throughout his life was spent in bars. He was quite selective about what he imbibed and certainly had his preferences. After spending some time in Cuba, Hemingway quickly became enamored with the daiquiri. In 1921 Constantino Ribailagua, of El Floridita in Havana, created this variation in honor of his daiquiri-loving regular. As far as the drink goes, you will enjoy this amplified daiquiri because it brings the sweetness of maraschino along with tart grapefruit into the classic rum-lime mix.

Add some vanilla vodka and a pumpkin liqueur and you have a drink that will grab anyone's attention. To finish off the pumpkin pie-like experience, the glass is adorned with an Oreo cookie rim.

The wonderfully flavored drink was created by Judy Bronson, a cocktail enthusiast and psychologist by trade. What's most enjoyable is that she has taken common ingredients that are easy to find and combined them in an intriguing way.

It is a very useful syrup that you can use all summer long to create fresh sodas with and without the booze. Dry's lavender soda is a must for this cocktail because it adds another layer of the fragrant herb to the mix and is not sweet like many other sodas.

That makes the grasshopper one of the oldest dessert cocktails and it remains an indulgent favorite today. This delicious green martini is light on the alcohol and heavy on the sweet flavor. While the three ingredients are traditionally poured equally, you can experiment with the ratio to suit your personal taste. If you feel like a little extra chocolate, add more cr\u00e8me de cacao.

Green beer is a novelty that American drinkers have latched onto and it has quickly become the drink to have each and every St. Patrick\u2019s Day. There is something appealing about turning everything green on the Irish holiday and beer just happens to be one of the most popular items to play with. Rumor has it, a doctor created green beer as we know it. Dr. Thomas Curtin, a coroner's physician and eye surgeon, first colored beer for a St. Patrick's Day party at the Schnerer Club of Morrisania in the Bronx in 1914. There is no trick to making green beer and it requires no special bartending skills. It is, quite simply, a light-colored beer that has a drop of green food coloring added to it. The flavor does not change, only the color. It should be noted that if you want to drink like a real Irishman and celebrate the Emerald Isle\u2019s heritage, nothing is more appropriate than a pint of Guinness or a shot of Irish whiskey. There is even a Green Beer Day if you need another reason to drink green beer. Green Beer Day is a day-long party where celebrants drink beer dyed green. The tradition started at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and was first celebrated in 1952. It is celebrated annually on the Thursday before spring break.

It's good with some of mid- to high-range blended Scotch whiskey, though you may want to try your favorite single malt as well. The almond-scented amaretto softens the Scotch whiskey, but it is still a stiff drink that a tough guy (or gal) can sip slowly at the end of a hard day. Or, enjoy it with a dessert such as tiramisu, cheesecake, or baklava. The origins of the drink are murky but it debuted around the time of the Oscar-winning and wildly popular film \"The Godfather\" in the 1970s. The connection with the movie may be because this drink uses amaretto, a sweet Italian liqueur. It also has a slow-sipping feel.

There are just a few additions in this recipe from an easier gl\u00f6gg recipe, but they really do not create much more work. The ginger, vanilla, nutmeg, and brown sugar give the warm drink a spectacular touch of spice. Also, Sohlberg uses both vodka and either brandy or spiced rum to accent the red wine base, so it has a little more of a punch.

They're entirely different, but the one ingredient that each recipe has in common is Frangelico, the hazelnut liqueur first created by Italian monks (the bottle is still adorned with a rope belt and this connection led to the drink's name). In the Friar Tuck No. 1, Frangelico is paired with dark cr\u00e8me de cacao and cream while the Friar Tuck No. 2 has lemon juice, grenadine, and (usually) brandy. Both are good drinks and there's a Friar Tuck for whatever mood you're in, whether that's chocolate and cream or soft and fruity.", "rating": "4.5", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/friar-tuck-cocktail-recipes-759663"},

The cognac adds warmth to the chilled drink and the flavor mixes nicely with the nutty sweetness of amaretto.

It is a homemade mixer that flavors a 1:1 simple syrup with fresh eucalyptus leaves and it's easy to make. When that is paired with a fantastic gin and a little lime juice, the drink comes together with a cooling, refreshing sweetness against a botanical background.

One simply warms everything together and the other involves a little showmanship. If you choose to light a fire in a ladle full of rum, be sure to use caution. Definitely do not be near the Christmas tree! For both types of service, you will want to make sure that both your punch bowl and glasses are suitable for warm drinks.

The recipe is incredibly easy, focusing primarily on gin and adding just a hint of green cr\u00e8me de menthe. You want to be careful about adding too much mint because it will overpower the gin and knock the drink out of balance.

Apparently, it backfired because business dropped considerably at his most popular establishment, the Caf\u00e9 Montmartre, which is credited with starting the entire Hollywood nightclub scene. The cocktail itself is almost identical to the Boston sidecar with just a couple differences. Both cocktails include brandy and rum, though the Embassy specifically calls for Jamaican rum rather light rum, as well as Cointreau.

The gin is full-bodied and has hints of fruit within the botanical notes. When paired with the strong anise flavor of absinthe and the final accent of orange bitters, you're left with an intriguing taste of old-school cocktails at their best. This cocktail got its start in the days before Prohibition. It was most likely named after the famed glass maker, Christian Dorflinger.

When you want to go from a Long Island to an electric iced tea, you'll have to make two simple changes. The first is to replace the triple sec with the \"electrifying\" hue of blue cura\u00e7ao; both are orange liqueurs, so only the color changes.

It's interesting that every cocktail in this section of the 1934 bartending guide lists \"Bacardi\" instead of \"rum.\" It points to a time when the brand dominated the rum market, a status that it would hold for much of the century. There was also a certain fascination with Cuba among American drinkers at this time. During Prohibition, the island was a favorite retreat for those wishing to legally imbibe and a refuge for many U.S. bartenders who would otherwise have been out of work. Where Bacardi may have been the preferred choice back then and used more as a generic term for all rum, today there are numerous white rum options to enjoy in cocktails like this.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/cuban-rose-cocktail-recipe-760512"},

Whitfield's \"Just Cocktails.\" While it has the whiskey-sweet vermouth combination that makes the Manhattan wonderful, Benedictine sets the Creole cocktail apart. It brings in an herbal sweetness and is accented nicely with maraschino, offering a new dimension of flavor to a very familiar drink. The ratio used here is similar to that of the original recipe. It did need a few adjustments to get the quantity up to a modern-sized cocktail, though.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/creole-cocktail-recipe-761434"},

Originally the brainchild of New York City-based mixologist Benjamin Maury. It uses vanilla vodka as the base, which is perfect against the creamy custard and accented beautifully with a hard caramel garnish. To pull it off, you will need to make cr\u00e8me anglaise. It's a simple vanilla custard sauce made of egg yolks, sugar, milk, and vanilla extract. Follow Maury's suggestion and add 1 tablespoon of port wine to that recipe. Worth the effort, this is one dessert cocktail that you'll want to perfect ahead of time.

That's why it can get away with using three sweeteners: sugar, grenadine, and raspberry syrup. For the latter, go ahead and use Chambord or another raspberry liqueur. These are easier to find than the syrup and you may already have a bottle in your bar. While you can skip it, the egg white adds to the commodore's luscious taste.

Served as a tall drink, the Colt 45 is designed to be drunk slowly. If you enjoy the taste of Red Bull, you'll likely find the array of herbs and botanicals found in both J\u00e4germeister and gin to be a nice addition.

Despite its deceptive name, this is a classic cocktail. It first appeared in print in Jerry Thomas' 1887 book, \"The Bar-Tender's Guide or How to Mix All Kinds of Plain and Fancy Drinks.\" It is one of the more unusual drinks from the time, though the brandy, ruby port, and egg with just a hint of sweetness make a fabulous drink that is very enjoyable.

The cocktail itself is a delightful mix of pineapple and white cranberry juices with a tequila background. Tequila Herradura created this recipe, so it naturally recommends the brand's silver tequila. It's a great premium choice that serves this drink and any tequila cocktail well. At first, it can be tricky to rim separate sections of a glass with three different colors of sugar.

A recipe from St. Germain, the elderflower liqueur is fantastic against the recipe's strawberry and sparkling wine. A dry ros\u00e9 is recommended and you'll find it to be an excellent choice because the pink wine is known for its strawberry notes.

The stunning blue color comes from blue cura\u00e7ao, the most reliable liquor in the bar to get that color.

It's believed that the building is the eternal home for the spirits of legends like Marilyn Monroe, Carole Lombard, and Montgomery Clift. The candy vodka infusion only takes a couple of hours so it can be prepared the day of the party. Make the cinnamon syrup at the same time and you'll be all set.

There is some prep involved with this punch, but it is nothing that is too taxing and you can do most of the work a few days before your party. Begin by infusing a great whiskey from Colorado with fresh pineapple, then do some quick stovetop magic to create the coriander-pineapple syrup. At the same time, you may also want to freeze your remaining pineapple in cubes to be used as ice. When party time comes around, puree more pineapple, squeeze a few lemons, and caramelize a few more.

This is one of those easy vodka cocktails that is a good everyday drink. It is reliable and one that you can mix up in minutes. This is also one of the few times that the ingredients (particularly the vodka) do not really matter. Cranberry juice has a heavy flavor and it will disguise almost any impurities that are in the vodka, so go ahead and use the budget-friendly brands.

It is a triple-layered drink that is perfect for practicing your layering skills and a ton of fun at parties. The original B-52 shot is reported to have been created sometime in the 1970's. This was a decade of layering Galliano atop the Harvey wallbanger and multi-liquor icons like the Long Island iced tea. Out of this same era came the popular round of shots collectively known as the B-50s. The B-51, B-52, B-53, and B-54 all have three things in common: Kahlua, Baileys, and Grand Marnier are the stars of the B-52. These three liqueurs combine to create a delightful taste, with a little citrus to accent the coffee cream.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/b-52-triple-layered-shot-759583"},
{"name": "Bramble", "base": "gin", "description": "The bramble is a modern classic and a simple gin cocktail with a fruity flair. The story goes that it was created in 1984 by U.K. bartender Dick Bradsell and it has been enjoyed by many drinkers ever since. The featured ingredient of this enhanced gin sour is the cr\u00e8me de m\u00fbre, a sweet blackberry liqueur. It is not a standard bar ingredient, though it is nice to have around for drinks such as this, and there are simple substitutions available. If you have access to a good crop of blackberries, you can even make your own. It's as easy as using the berries in a standard homemade liqueur recipe. The bramble should not be confused with the Bramble Bar, which is made with scotch, apple juice, and elderflower. Both make fantastic summertime drinks, and they're rather nice to serve together.", "rating": "4.5", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/the-bramble-cocktail-recipe-760013"},

If you are looking for a classic martini that is not as dry as some, this is a great option. It's perfect for a meal and it's really nice any time you simply want a good gin cocktail. The story of how the Bronx was created has been questioned many times over the years. It's generally accepted that Johnnie Solon created it at the Waldorf Astoria sometime shortly after 1900. The remarkable thing is that Solon didn't drink himself. Nonetheless, as you will see, he had the uncanny ability to create great drinks.", "rating": "4.5", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/bronx-cocktail-recipe-759608"},
{"name": "Bocce Ball", "base": "vodka", "description": "The bocce ball is a tall, refreshing juice highball with a recipe that's popular enough to memorize. It is a simple mixed drink, although there are a few ways to make it. The main elements in any bocce ball are amaretto and orange juice. The almond notes pair very well with citrus, creating a fun twist on the average orange juice highball. Some variations, like this one, include a shot of vodka and opt for less amaretto, creating a drink that is more similar to the screwdriver. A splash of soda water also adds a touch of air to the drink, making it a bit more refreshing.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/bocce-ball-cocktail-recipe-761017"},
{"name": "Black Velvet", "base": "beer", "description": "The black velvet is an interesting mixed drink that combines \u200b\u200bChampagne and dark beer in a single glass. One may think this an unlikely combination but it's actually quite good. It has been around for a very long time and may even be the original beer mixed drink! Supposedly, the black velvet was created by a London steward. It was served while the country was in mourning over the 1861 death of Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert. For the stout, Guinness Extra Stout is an excellent choice and the most common beer poured in this cocktail. If you're careful while pouring it, you can get the two ingredients to create the beautiful layers of pale sparkling wine with a thick black top and foamy head. It can be helpful to use the bartender's floating trick by pouring the beer over the back of a bar spoon to disrupt the flow. It's the secret behind other layered beer drinks like the black and tan. The drink has been such a hit over the years that it has inspired a few companies to bottle similar mixes over the years. However, it's rare that these last long on the market. That's not really a surprise because it's such an easy mix that anyone can pull off at home.", "rating": "4.5", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/black-velvet-recipe-759594"},

Blue cocktails are always hard to resist because the color lures you in for a taste of the sweet tropical flavor. This recipe, which is nicknamed the \"swimming pool cocktail,\" is one of the best, and it's tempting to drink more than one. In essence, this is a blue version of the popular pi\u00f1a colada. It simply splits up the coconut and pineapple flavors to allow room for the blue cura\u00e7ao. That orange-flavored liqueur is responsible for the drink's mesmerizing aquamarine color. You have three options when it comes to mixing this tropical summer cocktail: Stir it, shake it, or blend it.

It is the creation of Bridget Albert, Master Mixologist and author of \"Market-Fresh Mixology.\" It is a fantastic mix of pomegranate and cherry, featuring a black cherry rum and Pama Liqueur. The real magic, however, is the use of fondant, which you can buy from cake or candy suppliers. This candy paste is cut into miniature stars and stuck to the inside of the glass before straining the drink.

This one uses orange liqueur to complement the vodka-raspberry mix, so the taste is amazing. Specifically, you'll want to use blue cura\u00e7ao for the orange liqueur.

The recipe features Amarula Cream, a South African cream liqueur flavored with the fruit of the marula tree. Most people compare it to Irish cream, but with a fruity twist, and it is a delight to drink. The nice part about the Amarula &amp; Eve is that it is not overly creamy or sweet.

However, its unique flavor combination is fantastic, so it gets a pass for breaking a few \"rules.\" It is perfect for the colder months of the year and might be the ultimate blood orange cocktail. If you're a fan of the dark, sweet citrus, you'll thoroughly enjoy this drink. The recipe was created by the Snake Oil Cocktail Company in San Diego, California for Dry Soda Co. It pairs the clean, smooth vodka of Ketel One with blood orange and cinnamon. While the finished flavor may be difficult to imagine, the first sip will prove that it really does work. The name \"almost a collins\" references the similarities and differences of this drink to the popular vodka collins. Essentially, this recipe replaces the customary lemon with blood orange juice, plain syrup with cinnamon, and club soda with blood orange soda. It is a fun variation and can offer inspiration for similar substitutions to create your own custom cocktails.", "rating": "5", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/almost-a-collins-cocktail-recipe-760950"},

This is one of those fantastic Russian vodkas that you can rely on to create great drinks. Where the Moscow Mule uses ginger beer for its ginger flavoring, the Stoli Alibi opts for a syrup. The ginger syrup is easy to make from scratch and brings in both a sweet and spicy element to the drink. When made with the best ingredients, the Stoli Alibi is an impressive, snappy vodka highball.

This cocktail was named after the famous Algonquin Hotel in New York City although when it was created is unclear. The midtown Manhattan hotel, built in 1902, was known as a \"dry\" hotel well before Prohibition. Whether the cocktail came about before or after the 1930s is up for debate.

{"name": "Aviation Cocktail", "base": "gin", "description": "The aviation cocktail is a fantastic classic cocktail with a long and rocky past. It's possible that this was the very first purple-colored drink and, without a doubt, it's the most popular recipe to feature cr\u00e8me de violette. This floral mix is simple, and in true old-fashioned style, it requires just a few ingredients. The combination of gin, cherry, violets, and lemon offers a refined and fascinating flavor that is unique in the cocktail world. The problem is that the key to getting the drink's stunning color is a somewhat elusive liqueur. Often overlooked and rarely stocked, cr\u00e8me de violette was revived with a 2007 release by Rothman and Winter. Today, a few other companies produce it, though it's definitely not the easiest liqueur to find. That liqueur makes the aviation cocktail what it really was meant to be, though even during the four decades of its absence, the cocktail was still being made without it. Interestingly, some drinkers have reverted to the maraschino-only recipe because they believe that modern cr\u00e8me de violette is not what it should be.", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/aviation-cocktail-recipe-760055"},

The absinthe cocktail is one of the purest ways to enjoy the notorious anise-flavored liquor that was banned through much of the world for a good portion of the 20th century. This recipe is very similar in taste and effect as the traditional method of drinking absinthe, which uses a sugar cube and absinthe spoon. In an interesting twist, bartenders of Thomas' time must have thought that absinthe wasn't enough anise for this drink. The recipe doubles up on that distinct flavor\u2014reminiscent of black licorice\u2014by adding a couple dashes of anisette. It should go without saying, then, that if you are going to try this drink, you really, really need to enjoy the taste of anise!", "rating": "4", "url": "https://www.thespruceeats.com/absinthe-cocktail-recipe-759567"},

It was most likely concocted sometime after the \"Apocalypse Now\" movie was released in 1979. That era was not the best time for impressive drinks in bars and many of the shots developed then were definitely of the \"What will this do?\" variety. As seen in recipes like the cement mixer, taste was not always the first consideration. And yet, this one isn't horrible.
