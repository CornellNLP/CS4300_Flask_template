Pair with fesh pasta, meat dishes, particularly lamb and feathered game, mild cheeses.", "reviews": "The 2016 Barbaresco is a tight and beautiful wine that will require more time to unwind and soften. This beautifully balanced vintage is characterized by a tight inner core of fruit that underlines the graceful aging capacity of these wines. The 2016 is shaping up to be one destined for long cellar aging. Now in its youth, the wine offers wild berry, rose and licorice aromas. Enticing aromas of violet, woodland berry, loose vineyard soil, wild mint and a hint of spearmint shape the intensely fragrant nose. The tense, young palate is still nervous but already boasts finesse, showing wild raspberry, crunchy red cherry, white pepper and star anise. Firm, refined tannins and racy acidity give it a linear, almost austere elegance, while bright acidity keeps it focused and balanced. Drink 2026\u20132036.\r\n Cellar Selection This is Produttori del Barbaresco\u2019s flagship wine, produced with fruit selected from their 54 growers, who collectively farm some 250 acres of vines, and it is a stunner in the 2016 vintage. It\u2019s ripe and precise, the vibrant red fruit lifted by fresh floral scents and subtle spice. The tannins envelop that fruit like a soft leather glove, as brisk acidity propels the flavors toward a vertical finish. There\u2019s no better bargain in Barbaresco, and with 22,000 cases produced, this should be on every serious Italian wine list and in every nebbiolo lover\u2019s cellar.  Best Buy \t The 2016 Barbaresco is a stunning wine with tremendous richness for this bottling. Ample, deep and powerful, the 2016 exudes pedigree and class from start to finish. I can't remember a straight Barbaresco here with this much fruit density and unctuous richness, and yet there is more than enough tannin and overall structure to give the wine its classically leaning feel. A blast of sweet red cherry fruit, tobacco, menthol licorice and smoke hits the potent finish. What a wine! Cherry, tar and menthol flavors mark this rich, silky red. Even more expansive on the palate, building to a long, complex aftertaste. Beautifully balanced, this picks up a minerally accent on the finish.

After tasting it with our panel, I later tasted it with Darrin Low and Arnaud Weyrich, who worked together on the blend, and who described it as a \u201cNew World style; a richer, riper pleasure wine,\u201d comparing it to the \u201cOld World, more transparent style\u201d of the 2015 Domaine Anderson (also recommended here). In fact, I find this to be the more delicate and transparent of the two, open and racy, with a lacy fragrance of red apples and apple blossoms. Perhaps it is more varietal: It just tastes so much like pinot noir in its light wild-strawberry flavors and tight, slightly stemmy tannins. It\u2019s completely appetite inducing, especially with King salmon roasted with chanterelles.", "rating": "93.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/carpe-diem-pinot-noir-2015/519162"},

{"name": "Vietti Barolo Ravera 2015", "price": 219.99, "abv": "14.5", "description": "Intense garnet red color. Very classic and traditional with a robust structure and intense tannins. Bouquet takes a little time to show itself with slight hints of yeast. It opens slowly in the glass touch of spice and menthol. In the final, the powerful structure and concentration soften the tannins potential. Pairs well with game, red meats, and cheeses.", "reviews": "Starting off a bit shy and closed at first, the 2015 Barolo Ravera showed noticeably better in the sample that had been opened a few hours prior to my arrival at the winery for my annual visit. This makes perfect sense as Vietti\u2019s wines are intentionally slow at first but are built to endure the long haul. From the Novello township, this vineyard site is recognized for it power, structure and the uniquely broad approach it shows to the palate. There is a larger span of black fruit at its core. The positioning of the Ravera cru means it is open to the elements and the cold air from the Alps, and the wines result in freshness and mineral character as well. Luca Currado describes a salty, anchovy-like aroma that does indeed appear. Otherwise, this wine shows tightly polished and glossy tannins. This Barolo, from Novello\u2019s Ravera cru, leads off an impressive set of 2015 releases from Luca Currado. It\u2019s rich and lively, with flavors of black cherry and seeded raspberry laced with notes of menthol, licorice and tobacco. Highly appealing for its energy and layered complexity, the wine has formidable tannins that call for patience.\u00a0\u00a7 The beautifully fragrant roses are impossible to resist. This oozes charm. Also, there are red cherries, cocoa powder and an array of wild herbs in the mix. The palate has toned yet muscular tannins that build nicely to deliver a concentrated core of ripe red-cherry flavor that holds long, fresh and youthful. Great Barolo. Try from 2022. The 2015 Barolo Ravera is once again the head of the class at Vietti. Bright, sculpted and wonderfully nuanced, the Ravera is very pretty. Floral aromatics and the pointed, brilliant fruit that is such a Ravera signature are very much in evidence. Hints of blood orange, mint, crushed rocks and flowers add shades of complexity as the 2015 gradually opens up in the glass. This is one of the finer wines of the year. Don't miss it! This red is full of sweet ripe plum, cherry and tar flavors, accented by\r\ntobacco and underbrush notes. Thick, dusty tannins coat the gums and put a\r\nclamp on the finish for now, but this shows potential. Best from 2023\r\nthrough 2045. The nose is rather shy but eventually reveals balsamic aromas of camphor that mingle with blue flowers and pipe tobacco. It\u2019s full bodied and austere, delivering dried cherry, pomegranate and licorice framed in tightly woven, grainy tannins that leave a firm, drying finish. Drink 2023\u20132030. Luca Currado at Vietti offers a very different expression of Ravera that's more extracted and structured than Abrigo's. It shows abundant aromatic force on the nose, with its lush cherry and tobacco aromas. There's fine weight of fruit and considerable density here, and it's robust without being too rugged. It's a solid and complex style, but it's also spicy and lively, and in no way heavy-handed.

(Tasted: December 16, 2019, San Francisco, CA) Plum, mocha and turned earth highlight the palate of this robust, full-bodied and powerfully broad red wine, tense in firm tannin and a cradling of toasted oak. The acidity helps to balance its heft, leaving a note of lasting freshness on the spicy finish. ?", "rating": "93.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/stags-leap-wine-cellars-artemis-cabernet-sauvignon-2017/539281"},

{"name": "Gaja Barbaresco (375ML half-bottle) 2016", "price": 139.99, "abv": "14", "description": "Immediately rich and complex, with racy violet, rose, black cherry and dark licorice, complemented by notes of white pepper, cloves and soft leather. An intriguing mineral character adds to the bouquet. Full and mouth-coating on entry and throughout the mid- palate, the wine shows layers of ripe, dark and juicy fruits, black cherry, plum and sweet blueberry. Licorice and dark chocolate notes further enhance the complexity. Barbaresco is a great food wine. Traditionally served with roasted braised meat such as beef, pork and boar, Barbaresco is actually very versatile: owing to its high acidity and red fruit profile. It pairs well with roasted chicken, veal, game birds and even seafood. Heartier pasta and risotto dishes are other obvious pairings, as are aged Italian cheeses.", "reviews": "Aromas of rose, red berry and eucalyptus mingle with whiffs of exotic spice on the gorgeous, fragrant red. Loaded with finesse and tension, the elegant, structured palate delivers crushed raspberry, white pepper and star anise set against fresh acidity and taut, lithe tannins. It's already compelling, but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2022\u20132036.  Cellar Selection This is all about finesse with power. Such great length here with ever so refined tannins and precise strawberry, cedar, dried-rose and mineral character. Medium body. Fresh and vivid finish. Hard not to drink now, but wait until at least 2021. I tasted this wine over two sittings, one at the winery and one at my home office a few weeks later. Although I can't claim any extraordinary differences between the two sessions, I noticed a few minimal shifts that are essential to understanding the wine's future aging ability. The 2016 Barbaresco starts off slow at first, showing a small margin of aromatic evolution in the glass. But come back two hours later, and you can almost hear the soft sounds of the symphony playing just below the surface. The 2016 vintage is characterized by the solid intensity and firmness of its aromas, which transcend fruit and veer toward balsamic herb, licorice, tar and smoke instead. The tannins offer a moment of sweetness and softness, before you are aware of their undeniable firmness. In all, there is a certain glossiness or satiny quality to the mouthfeel that underlines the wine's carefully crafted integration. I would describe this as a classic and also a somewhat austere Barbaresco that fully deserves extra cellar time to stretch those tight muscles and grow in volume. This wine will award those who wait. This gorgeous red evokes rose, strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit, shaded by tobacco, tar and wild thyme notes. Pure, sleek and intense, with a firm base of tannins and vibrant acidity for support. This should evolve beautifully. Be patient. Best from 2022 through 2043. The Gaja family calls 2016 one of the best vintages they have ever experienced, with a long, slow ripening period without heat stress or disease pressure. That balance comes through in this suave, elegant Barbaresco. It smells of soft rose petals and tastes of juicy cherries and spiced raspberries, the flavors gliding along smooth, ripe tannins. With air, the wine picks up energy and depth, moving into a long, vibrant finish. The 2016 Barbaresco showed beautifully, with a classical yet seductive and sweetly fruited style that's going to evolve gracefully. Medium ruby-hued, with a core of sweet red fruits balanced by classic dried flowers, licorice, asphalt, and medicinal herbs, it hits the palate with medium-bodied richness that carries impress sweet fruit as well as building tannins. Barbaresco doesn't get more classic, and while it has a sunny, sweetly fruited style, it also has ample underlying tannins and structure, so give bottles 4-5 years. It should deliver the goods for two decades or more. The nose is poised, displaying very ripe raspberry and black berry aromas. The attack has intensity, partly thanks to its pungent acidity, but there's no rawness and the tannins are ripe. This is taut and structured and needs time. While concentrated, it's not excessively so, and the wine retains its delicacy through the very long finish.

Lean, refined and elegant on the palate, this is a dry and silky textured, vivacious, and perfectly fresh and balanced aperitif Champagne. It does not have the opinion-dividing thrill and tension of the Ultra Brut, but will probably find more friends.

Seamless and captivating in the glass, it possesses magnificent richness, volume and intensity in every dimension. The Cabernet Franc, usually such a strong signature, is nearly buried by the sheer intensity of the Merlot fruit. Espresso, mocha, licorice and plum infuse the racy finish. The 2015 is going to need the better part of a decade to be expressive. Tasted two times. Composed of 55% Merlot, 38% Cabernet Franc and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon and aged in French oak, 55% new, for 17 months, the 2015 Canon la Gaffeliere features a deep garnet-purple color and a cedar-laced nose to begin, giving way to fragrant underlying scents of roses and violets with a core of crushed black currants, blackberries and Bing cherries plus hints of fallen leaves and dusty earth. Medium to full-bodied, the seductively perfumed red and black fruit fills the mouth, framed with plush tannins and plenty of freshness, finishing very long and minerally. Still youthfully tight and backward, with a well-roasted frame of alder and juniper holding sway for now, but the core of cassis, blackberry and plum fruit waits in reserve, showing prodigious depth. When the toast and fruit melds, the backdrop of tobacco, singed iron and chalky minerality will get a turn to show. There\u2019s a lot here. Built for the cellar. Best from 2025 through 2040. The aromas of violets and rose petals are prevalent here with blue fruits as well. Full body, integrated and firm tannins and a long finish. Structured yet fine and shows such finesse. Give it five or six years to come together. After tasting this wine over the past two decades, I have grown to see it as one of Saint-\u00c9milion's most powerful wines. The wine always offers excellent black fruit and oak aromas and flavors, but its tannins have also been strong. The 2015 Ch\u00e2teau Canon-la-Gaffeli\u00e8re has all of its parts in check, and the wine is stunning. The wine is quite substantial on the palate and exhibits bright blackcurrants, with a hint of violets. Pair its balanced richness with a crown roast of lamb.

Blueberries, violets/spring flowers, Asian spices, and a salty minerality all emerge from this full-bodied, yet elegant 2015 that has sweet tannin, a big mid-palate, and a great, great finish. Still tight and reserved, give bottle 3-5 years of bottle age and enjoy over the following two decades or more. This structured wine also offers juicy, elegant fruit. Full of black plums, spice from judicious wood aging and acidity, its core remains to develop. The wine needs to age so drink after 2024. Pure and fragrant with a delightfully perfumed nose. The palate is harmonious and poised with a velvety texture showing maturity and freshness. Fruit very much to the fore backed by fine-grained tannins and a persistent finish.

{"name": "Louis Roederer Cristal Brut with Two Flutes and Gift Box 2008", "price": 329.99, "abv": "12", "description": "Gift pack containing one bottle of 2008 Louis Roederer Cristal Champagne, and two Champagne glasses. The special Cristal glass was co-designed by Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon, Cellar Master of Louis Roederer and Philippe Jamesse, Head Sommelier at Les Cray\u00e8res in Reims. It is produced in limited edition by renowned French glassmaker Lehmann. The unique shape and size allows Cristal its full expression. Cristal is Louis Roederer\u2019s flagship cuv\u00e9e. It was created in 1876 and is composed of Grand Crus from the Montagne de Reims, the Marne Valley and the C\u00f4te des Blancs. Cristal 2008 was bottle-aged for 8 years before being left to rest for at least 8 months after disgorging in order to attain perfect maturity. Amber hue with green and orange tints. Fine, even and lively sparkle. Complex and intense bouquet disclosing candied citrus, yellow fruit, Williams pear, pollen, and toasted almond. The delicately seductive bouquet shows intensity and well-honed precision. The wine is powerful, full yet tight, on entry to the palate. The 2008 is undeniably well structured but in a particular way: the wine's almost saline concentration has not been created by the sun, but is derived from the dryness of the chalk soil in a particularly cool summer. The result is a smooth, almost liquorous, mouthfeel that coats the palate with a powerful yet soft texture. This gives way to an incredible finish, underpinned by freshness and an impression of absolute purity with a taut and very saline character. The Cristal 2008 is deep, intense and masterful. It offers the quintessential reflection of its chalk soils which lend it is velvety texture and delicate tension. This wine\u2019s energy has been tamed by an unusually long period of bottle ageing: Cristal 2008 was in fact aged for 10 years before its release on the market. A first! Blend: 60% Pinot Noir, 40% Chardonnay", "reviews": "This latest incarnation of the famous brand is a superb wine. It is on par with, maybe even better than, the already legendary 2002. Its balance is impeccable: Apple and citrus flavors working with the tight minerality to give a textured yet fruity wine. Produced from Roederer's own vineyards which are mainly biodynamic, the wine has its own intense purity and crispness. It has amazing potential and is likely to age for many years. Drink from 2020.  Cellar Selection The 2008 Cristal is a perfect wine, and Champagne simple does not get any better. This incredible wine offers a beautiful perfume of clean, crisp fruits, layers of complexity in its toasted spice and white flowers, and an utterly seamless, yet powerful style on the palate. This is a rich, decadent expression of Cristal yet it\u2019s still crystalline and elegant, with no sensation of weight, and it just glides over the palate. Haut Couture at its finest and this majestic, profound, legendary Cristal can be drunk anytime over the coming 2-3 decades. Disgorged October 2016 and will be the first Cristal to be released ten years from harvest when it is offered in 2018. 35 parcels used from a possible 45 in this vintage. The assemblage is 60% pinot noir and 40% chardonnay. This is so fresh and tense and mineral with extremely exuberant chardonnay notes on the nose of white peach, lemon and yellow grapefruit, and hints of almost brambly sous bois aromas. The yeast characters are also super fresh, and there are subtle woody notes, with a hint of vanilla bean and light spices. The palate is super long, and very pure, powerful and focused. It drives deep and taut. Pinot noir is a strong core and the chardonnay sits at the edge offering lemon and white nectarine sorbet flavors. Staggeringly concentrated, yet the balance makes it seem airy and light. Acidity is perfectly positioned, and the power is intense and long. This is an ultra precise Cristal, finishing with a mere suggestion of savoriness and warmth to come. Impressive on release, this will be at its best drinking from 2025. COMMENTARY: Louis Roederer Cristal is an icon amongst all wines made in the world. One mention of the word brings a lifetime of memory to many of us professionals in the wine business. 2008, by all measurements, is widely viewed as one of Champagne's best vintages. When I got the chance to taste this vintage, I was happy to say that the wine lives up to both its reputation and that of the acclaimed year. TASTING NOTES: This wine is riveting. Its aromas and flavors of ripe apple core, creamy accents, brisk minerality, excellent acidity make it one of the winery's best of all time. (Tasted: September 24, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The 2008 Cristal is a real head-turner. Powerful, ample and explosive in all of its dimensions, the 2008 takes hold of the sense and never lets up. There is a crystalline purity to the flavors that is simply remarkable. Although still a baby, the 2008 looks like it will soon take its place alongside the greatest Cristals. Today, it is breathtaking.  Rating: 98+ Cristal 2008 is on a roll to yet higher levels of exquisite purity and precision of fruit in a paradoxical balance of weightlessness and depth of flavour, permeated with minerals and a salinity reflecting the greatest terroirs of the Roederer estate. Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon believes that 2008 is his best effort to date, and it's easy to see why. It's from a cooler, maritime vintage that came right in the end, with one of the longest harvests ever, running from mid-September to early October. The colour is a stylish pale gold flecked with green. Aromas of white flowers are joined by a cleansing citrus vigour and richer tones of peach and mirabelle. The palate is still quiet, but a tender creaminnes shows through, and there's so much concentration to come if you drink if after 2021. The greatness of the wine owes everything to the influence of organic and biodynamic precepts in the field - and Lecaillon's sleepless perfectionism in the cellar towards finer fruit and a careful brake on too much yeasty expression. The acidity is vibrant but better integrated in the 2008 than in the 1996. Magnificent. Dosage 7.7g/l.\r\n Drinking Window 2021 \u2013 2040 This expresses a sense of focus and vibrancy to the overall structure, while the palate is all grace and charm. A fine, lacy texture carries a tapestry of ripe white cherry, toast point, blood orange zest, honey and ground ginger notes, with a minerally, mouthwatering finish. A stunning Champagne with a long future ahead of it. Drink now through 2033. Let's start describing the 2008 Cristal technically first. It is a 60/40 blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from 36 plots in seven grands crus: Verzy, Verzenay, Beaumont and A\u00ff for the Pinot Noir and Mesnil, Avize and Cramant for the Chardonnay. Twenty-five percent of the wine was fermented in oak, and 16% underwent malolactic fermentation to moderate the fresh acidity of the 2008 vintage. The assemblage was bottled in May 2009. After 8.5 years on the second lees (longer than any Cristal before), the first release was disgorged in September 2017 with a relatively low dosage of 7.5 grams per liter.\r\n Rating: 97+", "rating": "98.5", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/louis-roederer-cristal-brut-with-two-flutes-and-gift-box-2008/552981"},

This is a medium-bodied, stimulatingly fresh and well-structured blend with gorgeous fruit and a clean, persistent finish. I'd like to brunch with it every Sunday morning until the night comes.

While this wine has always sparkled in a class by itself since its inception in 1921, the soon-to-be-released 2008 vintage reflects a transition in the winery's Chef de Cave. After nearly three decades as Cellar Master, Richard Geoffroy is turning the reins over to Vincent Chaperon, and the new guy gets to begin his Dom P\u00e9rignon career with one of Champagne's best vintages. I enjoyed the fortune of tasting this wine twice (9/24/18 and 9/26/18). In the first tasting, the wine seemed young and impenetrable. Time aided it, and it opened up spectacularly. Two days later, in a new situation (and a different bottle, of course), the wine seemed to be even more evocative. In both cases, there is no question this is one of the winery's best efforts. I took more than my usual sips\u2014studying a wine of this magnitude sometimes needs patience. TASTING NOTES. This wind deftly exhibits richness and elegance. Its aromas and flavors of bright apples, light chalk, and yeast autolysis come to the fore along with its and persistent, yet delicate palate presence and long finish should pair it superbly with the fresh toro you bring onto your palate. (Tasted: September 26, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The best Dom since 2002. A vintage with very restrained, powerful style that has been released non-sequentially after the 2009. This has a lighter stamp of highly curated, autolytic, toasty aromas than many recent releases. Instead, this delivers super fresh and intense aromas of lemons, grapefruit and blood-orange peel. Incredible freshness here. The palate has a very smoothly delivered, berry-pastry thread with light, sweet spices, stone fruit and fine citrus fruit. This really delivers. Drink now or hold. The 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon is the first time the estate has released a wine out of order (the 2009 was released before the 2008) but the estate loved the wine so much they felt it warranted additional aging. This is a rich, powerful wine that still shows incredible purity and elegance, with a stacked, concentrated feel on the palate. It\u2019s rare to find such a mix of ripe, pure, concentrated fruit paired with this level of purity, focus, and precision. This is a legendary Dom that surpasses all the great vintages of Dom I have experience with, including the 1990, 1996, and 2002. There's power to this graceful Champagne, with the vivid acidity swathed in a fine, creamy mousse and flavors of toasted brioche, kumquat, pastry cream, candied ginger and poached plum that dance across the palate. An underpinning of smoky mineral gains momentum on the lasting finish. Drink now through 2033. The super-fresh nose combines notions of smoky flint, lemon and wet chalk, yet hints at generosity. Minuscule bubbles create immense creaminess on a palate that dances on its light feet and channels freshness into poise. There\u2019s a promise of future richness and depth, always with ozone freshness and lasting length. Drinking Window 2020 - 2035 The finest release of this iconic cuv\u00e9e since the 1996 vintage, the 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon wafts from the glass with an incipiently complex bouquet of Meyer lemon, green apple, dried white flowers and oyster shell, with only subtle hints of the smoky, autolytic aromas that have been such a prominent signature of recent releases. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and complete, its notable flesh and amplitude controlled by incisive acids, with a youthfully exuberant but elegant mousse and a long, beautifully delineated finish. Considering the sheer size of this cuv\u00e9e, it's a remarkable achievement and a fitting release with which to conclude Richard Geoffroy's tenure as chef de cave. Given the 2008's intensity and balance, I suspect purists will be anticipating later disgorgements with lower dosage and more time on the lees with particular enthusiasm.

{"name": "Casanova di Neri Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova 2015", "price": 124.99, "abv": "14.5", "description": "At first sight, Tenuta Nuova already shows its potential from the bright red color. The bouquet is very expressive and intense, with notes of young red fruit, blackberry and the typical balsamic. In the mouth is full body, persistent and rich, with silky tannins and a superb lenght. A combination of elegance and power, it should be opened at least 2 hours in advance or alternatively decanting gently.", "reviews": "The purity of fruit in this wine really strikes you with black cherries, combined with sage, lavender and rosemary. Extremely aromatic. Full-bodied, yet so tight and polished with incredible tannin structure that gives the wine an endless mouth feel of caressing tannins, acidity and fruit. There\u2019s a fabulous saltiness and oyster-shell undertone to the fruit. Unique. Drinkable already, but this year there\u2019s the structure to last decades. Giacomo Neri and his family have crafted a wine that impresses from the first sip forward (especially when the wine is given ample time to open). The Casanova di Neri 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova must be treated with patience, and that patience is returned with many great rewards. Blackberry, plum and summer cherry are slowly folded into lasting flavors of spice, leather and beautiful balsam or medical herb. These are always a distinctive signature of this estate. The aromas flow with seamless transitions, and that fluid and ever-changing nature of the bouquet is what helps to build intensity and staying power. Fruit is harvested from a south- and southeast-facing slope at 250 to 300 meters above sea level. The soils are mixed loosely with crushed rock, allowing access to air and moisture. Indeed, pretty mineral accents appear as the wine takes on more air in the glass. What stands out most in this Brunello is the quality of the bouquet that is rigid and firm, yet not excessively so. You feel the structural texture of the wine as it sits firmly over the palate, yet there is mobility and softness to its many moving parts. I tasted this wine at various intervals over a 24-hour period. Rating: 98+ Tenuta Nuova has been produced since 1993. It represents Casanova di Neri's 'newer' vineyard of Le Cetine in the southern reaches of Montalcino which boasts stony galestro soils. This manages the warmth and ripeness of the vintage with tremendous sophistication. Balsamic herbs, Mediterranean shrub, juniper and crushed stone overlay layers of focused, luscious currants and black cherries. A bit of an iron fist in a velvet glove - but much more velvet glove than iron fist. Finishes long and invigoratingly salty. The 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova was quite restrained at first, requiring time in the glass to fully blossom, as subtle red berry fruits slowly gain volume and are then complemented by sweet red florals with hints of exotic spice, peppery herbs, and dusty minerals. On the palate, silky textures flood the senses with rich red berry fruits and sweet herbal tones, leaving hints of savory spice and minerals in their wake. The finish is long and unexpectedly fresh, showing the first hints of round tannins under a top note of sweet cherry, plum and a hint of black tea. There is so much going on here, yet it is all densely wrapped up in its youthful state.

Brunello is a brilliant ruby red colour, tending towards garnet red with age. Its bouquet is intense, pure, pleasant and refined, reminiscent of sweet violet, tobacco, chocolate and pleasant hints of wild berries and vanilla. Its flavour fully confirms the above in a well-balanced, full-bodied wine with good tannins and a solid structure.", "reviews": "The Altesino 2015 Brunello di Montalcino shows beautiful depth and latitude, with broad fruit aromas of dark cherry and cassis that recall the warmth and golden sunlight of the vintage. The wine is deceivingly streamlined in terms of mouthfeel, but that slim and buttoned-down backbone supports a broad range of flavors and sensations, from lavender essence and camphor ash to moist soil and toasted spice. All of these elements are delivered with impressive harmony and unity, and I expect that this wine will continue on a slow, steady and satisfying aging trajectory over the next 10 years or more. Fruit is sourced from across 21 hectares of vines with tufaceous limestone soils and Alberese rock, which contributes to the freshness and balanced structure of the wine. The wine was bottled in June 2019, and this wine was released in January 2020. Terracotta, earth, iron filings, cedar and leather make for an undergrowth-driven Brunello 2015, which doesn\u2019t fall short in the fruit department either, where there are red plums and red cherries. The tannins are neatly stacked, one on top of the other, with tidy acidity drawing in vibrant fruit and keeping it taut throughout. Balanced and stylish. Drink from 2023. Aromas of underbrush, leather, camphor and wild berry form the nose. On the elegant, medium bodied palate, licorice and clove accent a core of juicy black cherry while polished tannins lend refined support. Fresh acidity keeps it balanced. Altesino's 2015 Brunello di Montalcino offers a rich yet classic expression of Sangiovese fruit, showing ripe red berries coated in dusty earth tones, with hints of leather and dried florals completing the picture. On the palate, brisk acids frame silky textures, creating a polished expression of red and black fruits, savory spice and saline-minerals. The finish is long yet fresh, as cooling mint and licorice tones carry remnants of red berry fruit hovering above a core of fine tannins.

{"name": "Dom Perignon with Gift Box 2008", "price": 199.97, "abv": "12", "description": "2008 was dominated by grey, overcast skies \u2013 an exception in a decade characterized by bold, generous sunshine. Just when the harvest was getting underway, the weather conditions were finally perfect: blue skies and prolonged north-northeasterly winds. The grapes were riper than anyone dared hope, and had truly outstanding balance. The vines were in perfect health. To the bracing acidity, concision and aromatic purity expected of the 2008 vintage, Dom P\u00e9rignon adds depth, density and complexity. The light is warmer and less harsh. The opening bouquet is complex and luminous, a mingling of white flowers, citrus and stone fruit. The overall effect is enhanced by the freshness of aniseed and crushed mint. The final aromas offered by the wine are starting to show spicy, woody and roasted notes. After a long period of reluctance, the wine is finally opening up. There is complete balance between the nose and the palate. Its slender, minimalist, pure, toned, athletic character is now also expressed with warmth. The fruit is pronounced and clear. The vintage's characteristic acidity is remarkably well integrated. Its persistence is mainly aromatic, grey, smoky and highly promising. The wine enjoys duality: warmth & freshness, meat & iodine pairings, cooked & raw. Spices enhance and accentuate 2008\u2019s effervescence and densify the wine. Dom P\u00e9rignon likes playful experiences: culinary art, textures, and matters.", "reviews": "COMMENTARY: Dom P\u00e9rignon\u2014a luxury brand that needs no introduction\u2014is going to get even better as it moves through the generational changes with the changing of the guard. While this wine has always sparkled in a class by itself since its inception in 1921, the soon-to-be-released 2008 vintage reflects a transition in the winery's Chef de Cave. After nearly three decades as Cellar Master, Richard Geoffroy is turning the reins over to Vincent Chaperon, and the new guy gets to begin his Dom P\u00e9rignon career with one of Champagne's best vintages. I enjoyed the fortune of tasting this wine twice (9/24/18 and 9/26/18). In the first tasting, the wine seemed young and impenetrable. Time aided it, and it opened up spectacularly. Two days later, in a new situation (and a different bottle, of course), the wine seemed to be even more evocative. In both cases, there is no question this is one of the winery's best efforts. I took more than my usual sips\u2014studying a wine of this magnitude sometimes needs patience. TASTING NOTES. This wind deftly exhibits richness and elegance. Its aromas and flavors of bright apples, light chalk, and yeast autolysis come to the fore along with its and persistent, yet delicate palate presence and long finish should pair it superbly with the fresh toro you bring onto your palate. (Tasted: September 26, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The best Dom since 2002. A vintage with very restrained, powerful style that has been released non-sequentially after the 2009. This has a lighter stamp of highly curated, autolytic, toasty aromas than many recent releases. Instead, this delivers super fresh and intense aromas of lemons, grapefruit and blood-orange peel. Incredible freshness here. The palate has a very smoothly delivered, berry-pastry thread with light, sweet spices, stone fruit and fine citrus fruit. This really delivers. Drink now or hold. The 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon is the first time the estate has released a wine out of order (the 2009 was released before the 2008) but the estate loved the wine so much they felt it warranted additional aging. This is a rich, powerful wine that still shows incredible purity and elegance, with a stacked, concentrated feel on the palate. It\u2019s rare to find such a mix of ripe, pure, concentrated fruit paired with this level of purity, focus, and precision. This is a legendary Dom that surpasses all the great vintages of Dom I have experience with, including the 1990, 1996, and 2002. There's power to this graceful Champagne, with the vivid acidity swathed in a fine, creamy mousse and flavors of toasted brioche, kumquat, pastry cream, candied ginger and poached plum that dance across the palate. An underpinning of smoky mineral gains momentum on the lasting finish. Drink now through 2033. The super-fresh nose combines notions of smoky flint, lemon and wet chalk, yet hints at generosity. Minuscule bubbles create immense creaminess on a palate that dances on its light feet and channels freshness into poise. There\u2019s a promise of future richness and depth, always with ozone freshness and lasting length.\r\nDrinking Window 2020 - 2035 The finest release of this iconic cuv\u00e9e since the 1996 vintage, the 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon wafts from the glass with an incipiently complex bouquet of Meyer lemon, green apple, dried white flowers and oyster shell, with only subtle hints of the smoky, autolytic aromas that have been such a prominent signature of recent releases. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and complete, its notable flesh and amplitude controlled by incisive acids, with a youthfully exuberant but elegant mousse and a long, beautifully delineated finish. Considering the sheer size of this cuv\u00e9e, it's a remarkable achievement and a fitting release with which to conclude Richard Geoffroy's tenure as chef de cave. Given the 2008's intensity and balance, I suspect purists will be anticipating later disgorgements with lower dosage and more time on the lees with particular enthusiasm.

According to Pio Boffa, his team has worked for more than a decade to identify clones with smaller berries and clusters that give more consistent phenolic ripeness and allow them to pick earlier, which keeps alcohol levels moderate.

The Argiano 2015 Brunello di Montalcino shows a very lively bouquet that is already singing despite the young age of this new release. The wine opens to a dark ruby color with garnet highlights. The bouquet shows a large span of wild berry, earth, licorice spice and medicinal herb aromas. This vintage also reveals a pretty floral character with dried rose potpourri and lavender buds. After fermentation, the wine is aged slowly for 30 months in large oak botte (including 10-, 30- and 50-hectoliter capacity), thus restricting oxygen and gently slowing its evolution.

The finish is long and structured, buzzing with mouthwatering acid and spice, as dried cherry lingers amidst a coating of youthful tannin.

As of 2013, the historic Argiano estate has been led by winemaker/oenologist Bernardino Sani along with Francesco Monari, vineyard manager since 2006. All 50ha of vines are farmed organically, biodiversity is encouraged, and the company is now plastic-free. Pronounced forest aromas of mushroom, cedar and earth lead the way here. It's medium-weight with an abundance of sour red cherry on the palate. Wood tannins are a bit surly and need to integrate.

Ultimately, my decision to award 100 points to the 2016 Solaia came on impulse and with the most natural sense of purpose. I had also given the 2015 vintage a perfect score, and intellectually, it seemed impossible not to pick a favorite among these two stunning expressions. I will also state, outright, that the wines are very different, principally because the 2015 vintage shows more overall opulence and sweetness that extends to the pronounced textural richness of the mouthfeel. The 2016 vintage, on the other hand, is more chiseled and sharp with mineral shadings of campfire ash and graphite at the rim of its dark fruit. The mouthfeel is more streamlined and tight at its core, suggesting that the wine will unfold and soften beautifully with time.

The fresh purity of the fruit that permeates the entire palate is what makes this wine. The tannins are so compact and dialed-in, framing tons of violet and lavender flavors and carrying them long on the finish. 75% malbec and 25% cabernet franc. Drink in 2022. Blackberry and black currant aromas are not overtly oaky despite there being a touch of smoke to the nose. A flush, lush palate is pulpy and cut by lemony oak, while this tastes largely of blackberry, cassis and plum. Nuance and complexity are not highly prominent on this fruitforward blend of 75% Malbec and 25% Cabernet Franc. There is great purity in the 2016 BenMarco Expresivo. It's floral, ethereal, fresh and complex, and it's still very young and lively in a way that I really like. This year the blend is 75% Malbec and 25% Cabernet Franc, with all the wild herbs and flowers from Gualtallary. It has a vibrant palate, with the varieties nicely integrated and complementing each other. COMMENTARY: I have enjoyed the BenMarco wines for nearly two decades. The 2016 Expresivo Red Blend is a delicious blend of 75% Malbec and 25% Cabernet Franc.

On the palate, brisk acids frame silky textures, creating a polished expression of red and black fruits, savory spice and saline-minerals.

The 2016 Cos d\u2019Estournel was a bona fide showstopper out of barrel, the best that I had encountered in over 20 years of visiting the estate during en primeur, so my expectations were piled high when I returned to find out how it performs in bottle. Deep, almost opaque in color, it sports a very intense but broody bouquet with fathomless deep black fruit tinged with blueberry and violet. The aromas almost seem to envelop the senses. The palate is medium-bodied with ultra-fine tannin that I have never witnessed in any other vintage of Cos d\u2019Estournel. There is a beguiling symmetry to this Saint-Est\u00e8phe, as well as unerring mineralit\u00e9. The persistent, tobacco-tinged finish can be felt 60 second after the wine has departed.

One of those \u201ciron fists in a velvet glove\u201d wines, with full-bodied richness and beautiful structure that\u2019s covered by thrilling levels of fruit and texture, it stays tight, compact, and incredibly focused on the palate. It\u2019s already brilliant given its purity of fruit and balance, but it deserves a decade of bottle age and will keep for 4-5 decades. This is a little tight right now, as are so many of the 2016s. The fruit is deep, dark and concentrated, with fierce tannins that will take a long time to come around but will age well. There's no question that this is a monumental Cos, with the walls of slate ready to be scaled, joined by a rosemary and black olive tang, juicy liquorice root and lashings of cassis. I tasted this wine both en primeur and again during a vertical at the property in July, and have felt thrilled to recommend it each time.

Roederer's winemaking style is based on two elements: ownership of its own vineyards and the addition of oak-aged reserve wines to each year's blend or cuvee. All the grapes for the Anderson Valley wines are grown on the Estate. Each year, the winemaker selects a portion of the best wines for aging in Center of France oak casks. Aged from one to three years, wines from this reserve cellar are added to the blend, creating a multi-vintage cuvee in the traditional Roederer style, known for its body, finesse and depth of flavor. The Roederer Estate Brut debuted in October 1988, and has since established its reputation as one of California's premier sparklers, remaining true to the heritage of excellence and style of its French forebears.", "reviews": "Seamless and silky, showing an almost effortless sense of complexity, with notes of lemon and pear paired with toasty brioche, fresh ginger and hazelnut details.

It is vibrant and fresh and unstinting in autolyzed richness all at once, and it is as impeccably balanced as it is deep and continuous in flavor. Its wonderfully refined, terrifically sustained mousse heightens its sensations of brightness and youthful vigor, and it shows the complexity and crafting of a wine that we would guess costs far more than it does. Pretty red fruit introduces this wine, with hints of rose and cranberry (it\u2019s 40 percent pinot noir, the balance chardonnay).

Its wonderful play of creamy yet kinetic textures, the custardy, limey flavours, and its impeccable focus all add up to one of the best ways possible to greet 6pm after a long work day.

Cellar Selection Four plots in Avize, a village that delivers strong character in blanc de blancs, picked later and riper. The delicate lemons and fine, chalky minerals here are impressive.

Sourced entirely in Avize (toward Cramant in the north and Oger in the south), where \"Chardonnay behaved quite well that year,\" as Jean-Baptiste L\u00e9caillon put it. He noted that the 2011 Blanc de Blancs comes along \"like a Cr\u00e9mant from the Loire Valley rather than a Champagne from the C\u00f4te des Blancs\" due to its low pressure. Thirty percent of the cuv\u00e9e was fermented in oak (in 2017, it's 32%) to give a more rich and round style of Blanc de Blancs since the characteristic salinity comes in the finish anyway. \"We like texture! That's why we pick very ripe grapes at 11% alcohol. We don't chaptalize, and\u2014since 1930\u2014we don't need malolactic fermentation here. We just reduce the pressure to ensure a fuller, richer flow of bubbles.\" In fact, the 2011 is deliciously rich and charming but also pure, highly delicate (if not tender) and lifted by an airy freshness. The finish is pure and salty and underlines the great elegance, finesse and supple lightness of the 2011. To tell you the truth, this is a damn good 2011! Disgorged in January 2018; tasted May 2018. An elegant Champagne, this is finely knit and fresh, marrying the delicate mousse and lithe acidic frame with notes of Gala apple, lemon sorbet and slivered almond, accented by hints of fleur de sel, graphite and spice.

Drink 2020\u20132027 According to Pio Boffa, his team has worked for more than a decade to identify clones with smaller berries and clusters that give more consistent phenolic ripeness and allow them to pick earlier, which keeps alcohol levels moderate.

Around 55% of the wine was aged in new French oak barrels, 15% in two-year-old barrels and 35% in cement amphorae for 16 months. Deep garnet-purple colored, it opens with opulent scents of plum preserves, spice cake, hoisin and cr\u00e8me de cassis with fragrant wafts of potpourri, wood smoke and rose hip tea. Medium to full-bodied, rich and decadent, with loads of spicy layers, it has a firm, velvety texture with great freshness and incredible depth, finishing very long and on a compelling mineral note. The 2016 is a vintage that shows off the best of Pontet, and is similar in feel to their 2010. Gorgeously rich right from the first nose, it opens stunningly in the glass, showing waves of tight black fruits, touches of redcurrant, liquorice and aniseed, fine tannins and mouthwatering salinity. It manages to remain balanced without losing the punch and concentration of Pauillac, rising up through the palate.

Drinking Window\u00a02026\u00a0-\u00a02042 Reminding me of the 2010 and, I suspect, a wine that will merit a triple-digit rating in a decade or so (I tasted this on multiple occasions and thought it was perfect on one of them), the 2016 Ch\u00e2teau Pontet-Canet comes from 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc, and the balance Petit Verdot that spent 16 months in 50% new French oak, 35% in concrete amphora, and the rest in second fill oak. Thrilling notes of pure cr\u00e8me de cassis, lead pencil shavings, crushed mint, graphite, and crushed rock notes all emerge from this deep, powerful, yet elegant Pauillac. The style of this wine has become more and more finesse-driven and pure, yet it hasn\u2019t lost a beat on concentration or length.

Lots of anise and violet details cascade in on the finish, giving this extra aromatic dimension. Best from 2020 through 2038. Quite ripe with aromas of currants, violets, rich dark plums, dark chocolate, graphite and toasty cedary oak. Really complex. The palate has impressive polish and depth. Very supple and smooth tannins, carrying long, bright flavors of plums and dark cherries. Superb. Best from 2022. Stepping up in terms of grip and acidity, this really does pull you along through the palate, while bristling tannins hold things together. This majors on control and well-drawn cassis and bilberry fruits. It needs to soften, but should really go the distance. A fine and classic St-Julien.

The full and dense attack exhibits exceptionally well-rounded and silky tannins. The ample mid-palate abounds in black fruit along with cocoa flavours and biscuity notes, leading into a full-bodied and remarkably persistent finish, the sign of a great vintage.

Aromas of blackcurrants, black truffle, crushed stone, licorice and hints of tar. Full-bodied, deep and vertical on the palate, drawing you in and down. The structure is very tannic and powerful, yet the tannins are folded into the wine. One of the most powerful Moutons ever for me. Try after 2027. A towering, thrilling wine, the 2016 Mouton Rothschild is unbelievably beautiful today. Aromatics, fruit density and vertical structure all come together. In the glass, the 2016 is remarkably vivid and powerful, and yet a gentler, more feminine side emerges with time in the glass. The intense, mineral, savory profile recalls the 1986, but the 2016 has more grace, inner sweetness and sophistication than that wine. Even so, the 2016 is going to need at least a number of years in bottle before it starts drinking well, although it won't be the bruiser the 1986 remains to this day. This is breathtaking wine from Mouton, Tecnical Director Philippe Dhalluin and his team. Composed of 83% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 1% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot, the 2016 Mouton Rothschild has an opaque garnet-purple color.

Full-bodied, concentrated, bold and totally seductive in the mouth, it has very fine-grained, silt-like tannins, while jam-packed with tightly wound fruit layers, finishing in this wonderful array of mineral sparks. Magic. Along with the Ch\u00e2teau Lafite, the 2016 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild is the wine of the vintage from the M\u00e9doc and is a truly profound, magical, blockbuster wine in every sense. It\u2019s based on 83% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, raised in new French oak. Boasting a saturated purple color as well as an extraordinary bouquet of thick black fruits, lead pencil shavings, new saddle leather, and burning embers, with just a hint of its oak upbringing, this beauty hits the palate with a mammoth amount of fruit and texture yet stays fresh, pure, and light on its feet, with a thrilling sense of minerality as well as building tannins on the finish. It\u2019s one of the most profound young wines I\u2019ve ever tasted, and while it will probably keep for three-quarters of a decade, it offers pleasure even today. Bravo! A higher level of acidity than is usual for Mouton is buttressed by waves of fruit and tannin. It's a modern take on 1986 that shows the most wonderful precision of creme caramel, liquorice, blackcurrant, creme de cassis and cedar. it's opulent but also has great tension through the palate - a monumental Mouton that for me has gained in stature over the past two years of ageing. The idea of a drinking window almost feels like a mirage - the perfect moment is likely to recede into the distance time and time again. It could be drunk in the next decade perhaps, but it's going to take 20 years or more to really get into its stride. Easily one of the wines of the vintage, for me this is showing even better than during en primeur. 1% Cabernet Franc completes the blend. The rich fruit in this wine nearly envelops the tannins. Flavors of black plums, blackberries and blueberries meld with intense acidity to mask the power and concentration of the polished tannins. With this structure, will age for many, many years. Do not drink before 2026. \r\n Cellar Selection A generous, pure and lush ball of Cabernet, with wave after wave of unadulterated cassis and blackberry puree\r\nflavors rolling through.

I have savored the wines throughout my 40 years in my professional wine career, and the wine has always performed well. It begins with a refined mousse and entices with aromas of bread dough, ripe apples, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, as well as mineral accents. While it is full in its body and textures, its finish stays long, zesty, and memorable. Drinks well now, although today's bottle could use another half a dozen years in the cellar. (Tasted: September 26, 2016, San Francisco, CA) Lovely aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry and currant fruit, graphite, toast and candied Meyer lemon zest are set in this racy Champagne, with a refined, finely detailed mousse. The mouthwatering finish is long and spicy. Bollinger\u2019s NV Special Cuv\u00e9e knocks it out of the park. Made from 60% Pinot Noir, 25% Chardonnay and the rest Pinot Meunier, with 30% of the blend brought up in barrels, it boasts a rich, deep, medium to full-bodied style as well as terrific notes of lemon curd, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, caramelized stone fruits, and hints of toasty nuttiness that develop with time in the glass. It\u2019s a big, rich Champagne that stays balanced and pure. Beautiful stuff. As always with this producer, this iconic nonvintage cuv\u00e9e is dominated by Pinot Noir that gives impressive richness as well as ripe stone fruits. Wood fermentation adds further complexity as does the age of this bottling before release. Drink this Champagne now. Fine bubbles combine nicely with the cooked apples, pie crust and lemon rind. Some biscuit, too. Full body. Layered and creamy with a crisp finish. Always delicious. Drink now. Disgorged in the second half of 2019, the latest release of Bollinger's NV Brut Special Cuv\u00e9e is based on the 2015 vintage, complemented by around 60% reserve wines. The wine is still quite tightly wound after its recent disgorgement, opening in the glass with notes of crisp yellow orchard fruit, freshly baked bread, clear honey and orange peel, with little sign of the nuttiness to come with bottle age. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, muscular and incipiently textural, with a deep core, ripe acids and a pinpoint mousse. This isn't the most incisive vintage of Special Cuv\u00e9e, but it's powerful and vinous and will have fine gastronomic potential with a little bottle age.  Rating: 91+ Cool and generous, this is a bold, lusty Champagne with pinot-inspired scents of violets and flavors of dark berries, the wine structured by its time in oak. It\u2019s a vinous Brut, suited to roast fish and light game. 60% Pinot Noir; 25% Chardonnay; 15% Pinot Meunier. All Bolly in its toasty, chalky, slightly angular but powerful way, this wine reminds of the company's \"Grande Annee\" in its fairly bold approach. Frothy and insistent in its bubbles and tasty, rich, toasty, stony and vanillin all at the same time, this is Champagne with a purpose, and, in this case, it works without being over the top in any dimension.", "rating": "92.125", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/bollinger-brut-special-cuvee-375ml-half-bottle/18756"},

The candied fruit character and bright acidity balances out the wine's sweetness. So there is nothing cloying or heavy about it. Don't let the near nonexistence of color fool you, because this is a nice racy-sweet Moscatel. Aromas of citrus peel and air freshener are mild, while this feels juicy.

It starts with an explosion of fruit, blackcurrants, blueberries and cherries, that then gives way to a spring-like freshness. The nose reveals notes of broom and rosemary, like a walk through a field of flowers and a forest of eucalyptus. On the palate, we find a whole raft of delicate, smooth flavours.

Hitting 14% alcohol (the pH is 3.66), it reveals a ruby/purple hue as well as gorgeously sweet raspberries and cassis-like fruit interwoven with notes of spring flowers, rose petal, white chocolate, and spice. While it doesn\u2019t have the massive opulence of the 2015 and 2016, it\u2019s more classically styled as well flawlessly balanced, with a terrific sense of minerality, ultra-fine tannins, and a brilliant finish. Give bottles 5-7 years in the cellar, and it will evolve gracefully for 30-40 years. Hats off to Nicolas Audebert as well as the team of Thomas Duclos for one of the wines of the vintage! Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2017 Canon bursts from the glass with expressive notions of baked black cherries, kirsch, plum preserves and black raspberries plus hints of red roses, Ceylon tea, black olives and fertile loam. Medium-bodied, the palate is wonderfully elegant and refined, with a soft, finely grained texture and seamless freshness, finishing long and mineral laced. The blend is 77% Merlot and 23% Cabernet Franc and it was aged for 18 months in French oak, 50% new.  Rating: 96+ Extremely perfumed with blackcurrants, flowers, gunmetal, gunpowder and blackberries. Full-bodied, tight and reserved. The tannins are so tightly knit and just run through the center. Needs at least three or four years to open. A blend of 77% merlot and 23% cabernet franc. Better after 2023. Dark and dense, this is a massive wine. Big tannins are paralleled by concentrated blackberry fruits to give a wine that is both juicy and impressively rich. Structure and power are likely to be tamed as the wine ages. Drink from 2024. Canon remains pretty austere at this stage with the Cabernet Franc dominating. It's not as immediately seductive as some years, but you can feel the bedding down of the tannins, restraining the elegance and floral minerality but not hiding it completely. Sit with it in the glass and you start to feel a wine that rises above the vintage. This is one of the very few where you feel that in 10 years time it will clearly be better than it is today, most do not have that grace and confidence. I love the juicy finish here. 50% new oak.

Yes it is closed, not exactly forbidding but certainly austere, with big tannins, but less so than in some vintages at this stage, and it unrolls in the mouth. Deep purple colour, but not black. Coffee and spicy oak and seed-wood aromas. Packed extract and very complex flavours of spices, clove, earth, toast and black fruit. Very complex. Balanced fresh acidity with bright cherry-like freshness, but deep cassis and almost nutty complexity. Very good indeed. \r\n Barrel Sample:  95-97 A very focused, very pure rendition, laden with cassis, plum reduction and boysenberry puree fruit that is mostly waiting in reserve.

Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Best from 2025 through 2040. The watchword for this wine is style. Tannins underline the fruit.

It was fermented and aged on the lees (sur-lie) in small French oak barrels, with minimal new oak introduced. Malo-lactic fermentation was not induced, allowing the wine to retain its natural acidity and varietal focus. The result is a wine that is both rich and powerful, while refreshing and elegant on the finish. It has a ripe, spicy tropical bouquet with flavors that suggest citrus, pear and spiced apples. Well-balanced acidity gives it a crisp, clean finish, making it an excellent wine with food. Try it with cream soups, rich seafood, fowl, veal and pasta dishes.", "reviews": "Tasting of lemon candy and tart apple, this wine offers plenty of focused acidity beneath its textured concentration of prominent oak.

It has a powerful nose of baked black cherries, incense and melted dark chocolate that is very open and welcoming. The palate is full-bodied and understated on the entry, but do not be deceived, for there is a second wave of spicy, damson fruit laced with white pepper and even Szechuan pepper towards the finish.

Floral, silky and nuanced to the core, the 2016 is a wine of pure and total seduction. Freshly cut flowers, vibrant red fruit and creamy tannins all add to the wine's undeniable allure. In 2016, Prieur\u00e9-Lichine is all class, not to mention one of the sleepers of the vintage. Don't miss it! Tasted two times. With vineyards in the southern Margaux village of Cantenac, this estate has produced a deliciously juicy wine. The structure follows a straight line between the tannins and the intense fruit and acidity. The wine should age well, ready to drink from 2024. Rich and velvety red in colour with deep violet reflections, the brushed velvet appearance carries over to the texture on the palate. A good lineup of fruit flavours are joined by sweet softness through the mid-palate that widens things out rather than dips, and there's a slow build to the finish. Matured in 50% new oak. 2016 yielded 43hl/ha. A very suave, polished Margaux that delivers iodine and dark-stone aromas and a wealth of ripe, plush dark fruit that follows through to the palate in attractive, fleshy and juicy mode. Try from 2022. A restrained style, with a beam of cherry, cassis, lilac and sandalwood flavors, revealing a good fleshy feel and solid depth throughout. Light perfume and tobacco hints give the finish some added range. No fireworks here, just balance and focus. Best from 2021 through 2032. The 2016 Prieure-Lichine has a medium to deep garnet-purple color and a bold, intensely scented nose of warm blackcurrants, black raspberries and mulberries with hints of cedar chest, tobacco, dried herbs and iron ore. Medium-bodied, the palate has bags of class with lovely, vibrant black berries flavors and earthy sparks framed by ripe grainy tannins, finishing long and refreshing. Although putting a very fine first foot forward with its easy-toget aromas of cherries, raspberries and slightly sweet, dusty soil,\r\nbut despite initially in step upon entry, this wine grows a bit tight\r\nin progression and pulls back from its early flush of fruit. It is not\r\nwildly tannic, nor does it suffer from impolite astringency, but its\r\nfinish stands in contrast to the open accessibility with which it\r\nbegins and tags it as one that needs a wait of several years\r\nbefore fully blossoming.", "rating": "93.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-prieure-lichine-2016/153274"},

Dense purple-hued with a sweet bouquet of jammy blackberries, ground pepper, charcoal, and some smoky, meaty notes, it\u2019s a full-bodied, powerful, yet plush, even elegant Syrah that does everything right. Drink it any time over the coming 10-15 years. The 2016 Relentless is every bit as stellar as it was last year. Silky, nuanced and beautifully persistent in the glass, the 2016 is super-refined. A natural tendency towards extroverted power is nicely tempered in this super-polished and highly nuanced Syrah/Petite Sirah blend from Shafer.  Barrel Sample:  92-95 This combination of 90% Syrah and 10% Petite Sirah is memorable in its mix of wild herb and violet. Bright, thick layers of blackberry and blueberry dance along a mineral-laden core of crushed rock, wet stone and supple tannins Strikingly fresh mountain herbs and blueberries, as well as a cedary and dark-stony edge with earthy nuances, too. The palate has a gently grainy feel with sleek, vibrant berry aromas and delivers a striking mix of berries and chocolate at the long, detailed finish. A blend of 90% syrah and 10% petite sirah.

Already quite open, this is a cool and slightly shy wine with ripe plum, delicate herb and toasty aromas. The rather sleek palate and fresh acidity carry the long, clean, rather stony finish. For the first time, this is dominated by 90 per cent cabernet sauvignon. Drink or hold. The cedary nose of the 2016 Caro transported me to the wines from Bordeaux, and the explanation might be because the blend is 83% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest Malbec\u2014the highest percentage of Cabernet in the history of Caro. This has very good complexity; it feels young (Cabernet tends to develop at a slower pace than Malbec), even though it matured in 100% new oak the oak is very integrated. The barriques are only produced by the Lafite barrel makers, and there is great care in the selection of the wood and the toast; the barrels are designed to produce a more elegant style of wine, subtle and harmonious, with a notable absence of toasted and smoky aromas.

I was immediately struck by the direct and chiseled quality of the bouquet that makes a break from some of the heavier and more extracted aromas of the past. The aromas are bright and buoyant with ruby cherry followed by cr\u00e8me de cassis and dried cranberry. I love the way those perfumes caress and embrace the senses. The mouthfeel is perhaps less impactful in terms of length. It does show elegantly integrated tannins and fresh acidity, but I wish it lasted longer. This new and beautiful vintage of Santa Cecilia opens a new chapter, and I can't wait to try future releases.  Rating: 94+ A rich yet elegant Nero d\u2019Avola, which never fails to deliver. Smoke, dried rose petals, nutmeg and warm spices punctuate this richly flavoured wine, balanced by fresh acidity and velvety tannins. Smooth, harmonious and beautifully balanced. Enticing scents of wild berry, blue flower, exotic spice and Mediterranean scrub shape the nose.

On the palate, lush red cherry, pepper and a distinct mineral spin give it poise and purpose. Pair it with grilled meats, pork and tomato dishes. Editors' Choice The 2015 Xinomavro Hedgehog Vineyard was aged for 12 months in an equal mixture of new and second use French oak and comes in at 12.8% alcohol. If you want to know why this region and grape have a reputation for acidity, this issue certainly shows you. This is one good example. Alpha's Axia is another and the Kir-Yianni Kali Riza yet a third. Silky yet fruity, without a lot of concentration but with enlivening lift to the fruit and plenty of power, this has all those old-school Xinomavro nuances of earth and amber to go with the big hits of acidity. These types of Xinomavro make me think \"Nebbiolo\" every time. In fact, this often seems to have more rusticity than Alpha's upper-level (and typically more refined) Vielles Vignes bottling. When these old-school types come down the road, you are best off letting them rest a bit and coming back in a few years. The acidity and tannins will preserve them for a long time, perhaps longer than expected, so there is no rush. This is a fine value that does a lot of great things that wines in this price category often do not\u2014but you will need some patience, and it does have to be your style.

The grapevines are 43 years of age on average and are planted at a density of 4,000 per hectare. The 2012 vintage was harvested on October 2nd, and it yielded about 52 hectoliters of wine per hectare.", "reviews": "This is the 13th edition that Vietti has come out with, over the span of 38 years, of this stunning Riserva, a wine that ultimately is produced only about once every four years or so. It was not made after the previous harvest, in 2011. The recent editions have been nothing short of spectacular, earning 100-point scores in both 2007 and 2009 and 99 points in its latest appearance, 2010. It's a series that has set the bar extraordinarily high, and this 2012 Barolo Riserva Villero is a little less exciting in comparison. However, the wine holds its own as one of the most beautiful in the entire appellation and one of the best in the somewhat lackluster vintage. Balsamic and truffle notes pepper the palate of this handsome Barolo, but it's just really hard to reproduce that magic, release after release, for a wine regularly expected to sell at several hundred dollars apiece. This delivers a handy play between dried cherries, tar and pomegranate and fresh rose petals and citrus with lilac undertones; it\u2019s a very fresh and expert rendition of the hot 2012 vintage. While dense and ornately structured, in terms of the chunky tannins, there\u2019s real transparency that comes through, against a backdrop of extrovert dried fruit. Drink from 2023.

Boasting a deep purple color and beautiful purity in its cr\u00e8me de cassis, blueberry, white flowers, and vanilla bean, it hits the palate with medium to full-bodied richness, silky tannins, and perfect balance. It doesn\u2019t have the sheer depth of fruit of some of the blockbuster years, yet makes up for it with its incredible purity, poise, and balance. Relatively approachable for a Monte Bello, it\u2019s still going to see its 30th birthday in fine form. The 2016 Monte Bello is a blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 6% Cabernet Franc, aged 18 months in 100% new oak (98% American and 2% French). It has a medium to deep ruby color and is youthfully coiled, slowly developing scents of dark chocolate, pencil shavings, cedar, loamy soil, dried flowers, licorice, blackcurrant and black cherry with red berry sparks and exotic spices. The palate is full-bodied and youthfully firm, slowly unfolding with mineral-tinged fruits. It has a frame of firm, pixelated tannins and seamlessly woven acidity, finishing very long and full of latent layers. The 2016 Monte Bello is plush and dense, but with its typically distinct racy edge for counterbalance, with a massive core of dark plum and blackberry fruit scored by bay, sage and violet notes. It\u2019s among the best young Monte Bellos I\u2019ve had. A wine destined to evolve for decades, the 2016 is a muscular vintage of Monte Bello. That textural grandeur sets it apart from most contemporary California cabernets; and part of that distinctive texture connects to the way grape-skin tannins mature on vines David Gates farms on this coastal limestone ridge. All of the parcels that contributed to this blend are certified organic, a practice that also sustains the health of the microbial population Eric Baugher relies on for the yeasts that ferment this wine. It is increasingly rare to find cabernet sauvignon produced at commercial quantities anywhere in the world that does not rely on commercial yeasts; and whether or not you believe this is significant to the flavor and complexity of the wine, it is, in a real sense, a reflection of the health of the farming practice. If you are interested in a strapping young cabernet, infused with the kind of energy that health sustains, the 2016 Monte Bello is a wine for your cellar. A refined, creamy red with currant, fresh-mushroom, tree-bark and light dried-tobacco character. Medium body. Firm and lightly chewy. Linear and racy red.

All the grapes for the Anderson Valley wines are grown on the Estate. Each year, the winemaker selects a portion of the best wines for aging in Center of France oak casks. Aged from one to three years, wines from this reserve cellar are added to the blend, creating a multi-vintage cuvee in the traditional Roederer style, known for its body, finesse and depth of flavor.

The result of uncompromising insistence on grape and vintage perfection, our Blanc de Blancs is at the pinnacle of the style, and rates as one of the most remarkable Champagnes ever created \u2013 as well as one of the rarest. Our Blanc de Blancs comprises no more than 5% of our small annual production. This beautiful pale-gold 100% Chardonnay Champagne has a light, clear bouquet possessed of youthful fruit notes and floral accents. The structure of the wine is delicate and light; the palate is dry, ethereal and complex. Our Blanc de Blancs is bottled in a platinum bottle with matching antique silver labels and is an experience of ultimate luxury.", "reviews": "Smooth, floral nose; rich, elegant and smooth with freshness, depth and length; lovely and showing great finesse and style, 100% Chardonnay. In its silver-coated bottle with the \u201cAce of Spades\u201d logo, this is a crisp, mineral-driven wine, full of acidity and with a bright character on the dry side of brut. Young with layers of apple fruits, it will age. Drink now for the fruit or keep for maturity from 2018. This is one of five Champagnes by entrepreneur and rapper Jay Z under the Armand de Brignac Empire brand that is produced by the Cattier family, in Champagne since 1763. A sumptuous Champagne revealing wood notes of linden and acacia, along with woodland mushroom scents of shiitake, this has mineral tension and steely acidity to keep its broadness in check. Dark in tone, it requires decanting to open more fully. A mouthwatering inducement for butterbeans and white sausages. The NV Blanc de Blancs (tasted from the 0.75-liter bottle) is a pure Chardonnay sourced in the C\u00f4te des Blancs and the Montagne de Reims and is a blend of the 2005, 2006 and 2008 vintages. The cuv\u00e9e (Lot L107A8) opens with a clear, fresh and intense bouquet of ripe fruits and some chalky flavors. Full-bodied, terribly fresh and with good grip and tension, this is a persistent, salty-mineral and still a bit nervous Blanc de Blancs with good aging potential.\r\n  Rating: 92+ A bright blanc de blancs, with a crisp and lacy mousse, this offers notes of crunchy pear, ground ginger and lemon pith. Offers a clean-cut finish, showing minerally hints of smoke and spice. Drink now through 2020. This is the third addition to the range, launched around 2011. Again, it's a blend of 2009, 2010 and 2012, with 50% of the Chardonnay sourced from Cattier\u2019s own vineyards in Montagne de Reims, and the other 50% from the C\u00f4te des Blanc - mostly from the village of Cramant. This is definitely more complex, rounder and richer than your average Blanc de Blancs. Grapefruit and white flower aromas come to mind. While opulent, it is focussed, with tremendous depth wrapped up by a backbone of acidity. A hardly noticeable dosage of 8g/l.\r\nRead more at https://www.decanter.com/wine-reviews/france/champagne/armand-de-brignac-ace-of-spades-blanc-de-blancs-champagne-19333#YZWB5Aq6bZIWDR6z.99", "rating": "92.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/armand-de-brignac-ace-of-spades-silver-blanc-de-blancs-with-gift-box/127175"},

The winery brand has changed over the years and been able to stay current with winemaking trends. The 2016 Martin Ray Limited Release Cabernet Sauvignon from the Santa Cruz Mountains shows us how excellent this wine region is. TASTING NOTES: This wine displays outstanding balance and true-to-the-area nuances. Its aromas and flavors show red raspberry fruit and earthy notes that would work well with a savory lamb stew.

The wine\u2019s complexity is expressed in successive notes like vine peach and white fruits notes. A perfect balance between freshness and delicacy with fruity flavors very present on the finish. This fresh and pure wine is perfect for an ap\u00e9ritif. Its citrus and white fruits notes and its remarkable balance supported by a subtle effervescence, make it an ideal accompaniment to poultry and the finest fish.", "reviews": "The brioche and cooked-apple and cream character really comes through here. Full-bodied and round with fine bubbles. Flavorful and intense. Vivid, bread-dough finish. This is four years on lees. 55% chardonnay and the rest pinot.

A delicate Champagne, with a refined mousse and finely honed acidity, this offers a subtle range of black currant, lemon zest, toast and chalk flavors that linger on the lightly spiced finish. This wine's fresh fruit and firm structure match bright lemon zest flavors with limestone severity. The fine bubbles add to the clean sensation of the finish.

It's finely balanced, pushing both its fruit and acidity, with the tannins taking the supporting role. With its power leashed, this shows the stylish side of Saint-Julien, although it will certainly age for many years. The 2010 Branaire-Ducru has a lovely m\u00e9lange of red and black fruit, hints of dried blood and autumn leaves suggesting that this is moving into its secondary phase.

Very polished and stylish, with a velvety feel to the layers of crushed plum, currant and blackberry, while bittersweet cocoa and black licorice glide in on the gorgeous, black tea-infused finish. Features a lovely allure rather than raw power, making this possibly the prettiest St.-Julien of the vintage. There's plenty in the tank for cellaring as well. Best from 2014 through 2030. This wine is more backward than I would have normally expected, but nevertheless, it is very impressive. The 2010 Branaire-Ducru displays an inky bluish purple color and loads of mulberry, raspberry, black currant, graphite and floral notes in its intense aromatics. Medium to full-bodied , with sensational ripeness, purity, texture and length, the tannins are slightly more prominent than I remember from barrel, but they are sweet and ripe (as opposed to astringent and bitter). This beautiful wine needs 4-6 years of cellaring and should keep 25-30 years. A layered young red with lots of black olives and berries on the nose. Full body, with velvety and chewy tannins. It all comes together at the end with a lovely sweet fruit. Try after 2017. Wow, this is still knitted in, hunkered down, you feel the tannic frame, cradling the intense fruit that majors on spiced damsons and blackcurrants. What a vintage, and still really nowhere near being ready. I would suggest drinking the 2011 right now if you want a younger Branaire, this needs another five or six years.

Great notes of blackcurrants, smoked tobacco, gravelly earth, mocha, and hints of licorice all flow to a medium to full-bodied wine that has remarkable purity of fruit as well as polished tannins. It builds nicely with time in the glass and reminds me of a toned-down version of the 2016. This complex, elegant, flawlessly balanced Pessac can be drunk today with incredible pleasure or cellared for 15-20 years. I have found that Magrez estates have done exceptionally well in 2017, pretty much across the board, but here I feel a reach towards the barrel that is just the slightest bit out of step with the ripeness of the fruit.

It starts with an explosion of fruit, blackcurrants, blueberries and cherries, that then gives way to a spring-like freshness. The nose reveals notes of broom and rosemary, like a walk through a field of flowers and a forest of eucalyptus. On the palate, we find a whole raft of delicate, smooth flavours. The rich, detailed texture stretches out like Ariadne\u2019s thread, leading to a mineral, chalky finish, typical of the wines from the limestone plateau. Blend: 77% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Franc", "reviews": "Showing spectacularly, the 2017 Chateau Canon checks in as a final blend of 77% Merlot and 23% Cabernet Franc that\u2019s from one of the most exceptional terroirs in the appellation. Hitting 14% alcohol (the pH is 3.66), it reveals a ruby/purple hue as well as gorgeously sweet raspberries and cassis-like fruit interwoven with notes of spring flowers, rose petal, white chocolate, and spice. While it doesn\u2019t have the massive opulence of the 2015 and 2016, it\u2019s more classically styled as well flawlessly balanced, with a terrific sense of minerality, ultra-fine tannins, and a brilliant finish. Give bottles 5-7 years in the cellar, and it will evolve gracefully for 30-40 years. Hats off to Nicolas Audebert as well as the team of Thomas Duclos for one of the wines of the vintage! Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2017 Canon bursts from the glass with expressive notions of baked black cherries, kirsch, plum preserves and black raspberries plus hints of red roses, Ceylon tea, black olives and fertile loam. Medium-bodied, the palate is wonderfully elegant and refined, with a soft, finely grained texture and seamless freshness, finishing long and mineral laced. The blend is 77% Merlot and 23% Cabernet Franc and it was aged for 18 months in French oak, 50% new.  Rating: 96+ Extremely perfumed with blackcurrants, flowers, gunmetal, gunpowder and blackberries. Full-bodied, tight and reserved. The tannins are so tightly knit and just run through the center. Needs at least three or four years to open. A blend of 77% merlot and 23% cabernet franc. Better after 2023. Dark and dense, this is a massive wine. Big tannins are paralleled by concentrated blackberry fruits to give a wine that is both juicy and impressively rich. Structure and power are likely to be tamed as the wine ages. Drink from 2024. Canon remains pretty austere at this stage with the Cabernet Franc dominating. It's not as immediately seductive as some years, but you can feel the bedding down of the tannins, restraining the elegance and floral minerality but not hiding it completely. Sit with it in the glass and you start to feel a wine that rises above the vintage. This is one of the very few where you feel that in 10 years time it will clearly be better than it is today, most do not have that grace and confidence. I love the juicy finish here. 50% new oak.

Blend: 55% Carignan, 45% Grenache", "reviews": "The wine that used to be the top of the range until the old-vine, single-vineyard Cari\u00f1ena was released is the 2013 Doix Costers de Vinyes Velles. It is a phenomenal blend of 55% Cari\u00f1ena and 45% Garnacha from very old vines planted on schist (llicorella) slopes in the village of Poboleda. Dark, almost opaque with a bright border, the nose is more about black fruit, peat, graphite and some shoe polish, with a generous dose of oak, a little raw (from youth) but with harmony and huge potential to develop. The bunches are hand-harvested and the grapes selected one by one in a double sorting table and fermented in stainless steel. The wine matured in new French oak barriques for 16 months, in a straightforward process, because what's important here is the quality of the grapes, mostly from centenary vines. There is great harmony in the palate, too, intense and penetrating without being aggressive, elegant and balanced in an XXL way. I see great freshness in these 2013s, one of the best vintages I've tried from Mas Doix. This should age forever.  Rating: 95+ The first impression this wine gives is of an oak curtain that hides the fruit. Slowly, it fades to show the true face of this old-vine blend of cari\u00f1ena and garnacha: intense red fruits and herbs, with a heart of slate sustaining mineral tannins in the background. It needs time in the bottle to settle down. A pillowy texture carries harmonious flavors of black cherry, licorice, orange peel and cola, supported by light tannins and citrusy acidity. Not muscular, but has energy and focus. Drink now through 2021.", "rating": "92.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/mas-doix-costers-de-vinyes-velles-priorat-2013/431253"},

These terroirs are located mainly in the Clos L\u00e9oville Las Cases, which you pass as you leave Saint- Julien village for Pauillac. They extend over nearly 60ha producing Cabernet Sauvignons and Cabernet Francs with a complex, polished expression and characteristics which are totally unique to the Grand Vin of L\u00e9oville du Marquis de Las Cases and have been widely recognized for years. Blend: 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc, 9% Merlot", "reviews": "This is backward and dense, with thickly layered plum, blackberry, fig and blueberry reduction flavors wrapped liberally in warm ganache and melted licorice notes. A long echo of smoldering charcoal emerges at the very end. There's a lot to resolve here as the rich and austere sides are still melding, but the extra amplitude doesn't distort anything; it just all goes to 11.\r\n  Barrel Sample:  97-100 OMG. This shows amazing depth of fruit and density. Full-bodied and so layered with incredible fruit and power. Blackberries. Blueberries. Violets. Hints of dried flowers. Fantastic fruit and tannins, yet agile and energetic. The ch\u00e2teau says 2016 plus, plus.\r\n  Barrel Sample:  99-100 \u201cWe produced great Cabernet Franc this year,\u201d Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Pierre Graffeuille told me during my visit to L\u00e9oville Las Cases. Even though only 3% of the press wine was added back, he was also absolutely glowing about the quality of this too. And he should be\u2014the finished blend for the 2018 L\u00e9oville Las Cases is yet another triumph for this great estate. Composed of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, harvested September 15 to October 4 with yields of 35.5 hectoliters per hectare, it has 14.49% alcohol and will be aged in barriques, 90% new. Very deep purple-black in color, it is a little closed to begin, slowly emerging from the glass to reveal subtle woodsmoke, violets, tilled soil and underbrush scents over a core of warm cassis, wild blueberries and redcurrant jelly plus hints of rare beef and iron ore. Full-bodied, rich, super concentrated and bursting with latent energy, this is an atomic bomb waiting to go off in your mouth. It has a rock-solid foundation of firm, very ripe, very finely grained tannins and bold freshness supporting the muscular fruit through the epically long, amazingly nuanced finish. Simply breathtaking.  Barrel Sample:  98-100 A candidate for the wine of the vintage is the 2018 L\u00e9oville Las Cases. My notes on this incredible wine are laced with expletives that I, unfortunately, can\u2019t repeat here. Safe to say, however, it\u2019s one of the greatest young Bordeaux I\u2019ve been lucky enough to taste. Based on a blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, and 9% Cabernet Franc, from yields of 35.5 hectoliters per hectare, that will spend 19 months in barrel, it offers a massive bouquet of cr\u00e8me de cassis, lead pencil shavings, crushed violets, tobacco, and a liquid rock-like minerality. Pure magic on the palate as well, with full-bodied richness, building structure, and a seamless, weightless, yet powerful mouthfeel, it has everything you could want from a wine. It has the purity and balance to drink well in 7-8 years (I wouldn\u2019t hold it against you if couldn\u2019t wait that long) and will keep for 50 years or more. For the tech geeks out there, this hit 14.49% alcohol.  Barrel Sample : 98-100 2018 is another vintage where it's pretty much impossible to find fault with Las Cases, and where you get a kick of happiness from tasting it. Owner Jean-Hubert Delon compares the 2016 to the 1961 and the 2018 to the 1959 - let's all check back in a few decades to see if that's true!\r\n \r\nBut where the 2016 was monumental, this has a subtlety that's rarely seen in such a young LLC. It's not that you'd call this approachable but you rarely see this level of plush density to the fruit at this stage. There's a civilised quality to the structure that makes you think, just maybe, the 2018 will be at optimum drinking before the 2016. You're still getting the complex cigar box and cassis aromatics, with deep, rippling black fruits on the palate accompanied by a cassis and liquorice whoosh and the layering up of dense but fine tannins. It demonstrates precise balance and an exceptionally long finish. All in all, this is a standout St-Julien.\r\n \r\nThis year sees the lowest percentage of press wine ever used at this estate, coming in at under 3% (it's normally double this), because the wine already had so much structure that the normal level of press wine threw it out of balance. I'm pretty sure that I've never given a drinking window this early for LLC at En Primeur, which says something. 90% new oak. \r\n  Barrel Sample:  98 It is the tannins that mark out this powerful wine, presenting a fine balancing act between a firm structure and rich dark fruit flavors. It is the epitome of elegant Saint-Julien, with a welcome mix of weight and freshness.\r\n  Barrel Sample:  96-98", "rating": "99.33333333333333", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-leoville-las-cases-futures-pre-sale-2018/520576"},

June was the hottest month since 1980, with temperatures reaching 104-111\u00b0F in the Douro Valley during a heat wave lasting from June 7 \u2013 24. Due to these extreme weather conditions, all phases of the vine\u2019s growth were 15 \u2013 20 days early compared to 2016. The vines weathered the shortage of water and the high temperatures well. Harvest started much earlier than usual due to the weather: from August 17 for the white wines and August 21 for the reds and the Ports, lasting until September 28, with high temperatures and a total absence of rain.", "reviews": "This is well-packed, offering the vivid plum, boysenberry, cassis and a\u00e7a\u00ed\r\nberry fruit profile of the vintage, along with a dark edge of tar, baker\u2019s\r\nchocolate and salted licorice that courses underneath. The long finish lets\r\nthe fruit play out, keeping singed alder and chai spice hints in the background. Smolderingly seductive. Best from 2035 through 2060. The 2017 Vintage Port is a field blend, mostly Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinto C\u00e3o and Sous\u00e3o, aged for 18 months in old wood vats. It comes in with 99 grams of residual sugar. This was bottled in May 2019, about a month before tasting, but I made sure at least some of it had a lot of air. Aromatic, wonderfully fragrant and laced with eucalyptus, this then shows typical Noval focus and power. A couple of hours in a glass simply increased the power. More intense than the very fine 2016, it grips the palate and shows rather significant astringency. As wonderfully aromatic as this is, there the 2016 might have the edge. Big grip in this wine with dark blackberries, blueberries and floral notes. Fine tannins. Ripe but sweet and pretty. Shows a lovely finish. Try after 2027. The straight 2017 Vintage Port is stunning stuff. It packs serious power and richness while staying beautifully polished and, dare I say, elegant. Notes of cr\u00e8me de cassis and liquid blackberries define the attack, but it offers an incredibly layered, nuanced, complex style in its notes of herbes de Provence, violets, spicy wood, licorice, and Asian spice aromas and flavors. While it\u2019s no doubt a full-bodied Port, it stands out just as much for its incredible polish, balance, and purity. This a brilliant effort is more approachable than the Nacional bottling yet is nevertheless going to evolve for 50-60 years or more on its flawless balance. This is a solid wine with dark tannins and a definitely dry character that will allow it to age well. Its power and its density are impressive, with rich black currant flavors backing up the tannins. Drink from 2030. Jet black, this shows the arid vintage in its desert-rose scents and in the umami savor of tiny dried black currants.

Full body, firm and silky tannins and a serious finish. Extremely polished and structured. Selection of the best cabernet from this farm. A wine that is stands apart from the single vineyard bottling, the 2013 Finca Los Membrillos is sourced from a vineyard planted with Cabernet Sauvignon. There are quince trees in the estate and they give the name to the wine (membrillo is the Spanish word for quince). This is a plot bordering Altamira that was planted with Cabernet when they bought it. They have now also planted Malbec and Cabernet Franc, so this wine will change in the future. They won't bottle the 2014 and 2015 vintages that were not good years for Cabernet in Mendoza. It's not easy to detect the grape here anyway. I see more similarities with the Canal Uco bottling to which Sebastian Zuccardi responded that the soils are very similar. The wine has very good freshness with fine tannins coating a fine thread of lively acidity. They have four different types of soils here and they used three for this wine. When the soils are very shallow the Cabernet has a tendency to dry out and the tannins can feel a bit harsh, so they need to find good balance using deeper soils to obtain these buttery tannins with the variety. The oak is a lot more noticeable since they use more new oak with the Cabernet than with Malbec. It has classic aromas of the oak-aged Cabernet, quite different from the Malbecs, mint, damsons, blackberries, something earthy, graphite even, cigar box and spices, and with the telltale tannins of the variety where the earthiness is more pronounced. This will be better with a little bit of time in bottle. This boasts mouthfilling richness, with elegant and well-structured flavors of dried cherry, boysenberry and red currant.

The inky purple 2016 Trueman Cabernet Sauvignon is a super effort. It boasts intense, classic aromas of pencil shavings and cassis on the nose, then delivers rich waves of velvety but structured fruit on the full-bodied palate.

Juicy and vibrant, showing terrific purity to the raspberry and black cherry flavors at the polished and refined core, with supple tannins and details of Earl Grey tea, violet and toasted cumin. Impressive for the seamless harmony and the creamy texture, this shows a tug of grip from the tannins on the finish. Drink now through 2035. 2,650 cases made.

Lifted aromatics, bright, red-toned fruit and silky tannins add to the wine's brilliant, chiseled personality. I find the 2017 more precise and nuanced than in the recent past, with less overt power. It's hard to know exactly if the style of the 2017 is a result of the growing conditions of the year, or the result of an evolution in winemaking that includes the introduction of terra cotta, among other things. I certainly get the sense Guillaume Pouthier reined the wine back a bit in 2017. No matter. The end result is all that counts, and in 2017 Les Carmes Haut-Brion is positively stellar. As always, the high percentage of Cabernet Franc and a healthy dollop of whole clusters give Les Carmes an explosive bouquet and plenty of saline-infused energy.

There's a great complexity of flavours with touches of blackberry, liquorice, chocolate and rosemary, and although it's not as intense as most recent vintages of Carmes, this is well defined. The tannins are ready to go to work - there is a sweetness to the fruit that I have not found in all the wines, and suggests good ripeness. The savory edge of Cabernet Franc is still very much to the fore at this point, and there is good life ahead. One to look out for! Offering an Haut-Brion-like level of purity and precision, the 2017 Chateau Les Carmes Haut-Brion (41% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot, and 29% Cabernet Sauvignon) sports a vivid purple color as well as perfumed notes of blueberries, blackberries, unsmoked tobacco, crushed violets, and spring flowers.

This has some austerity on the attack, then announces its arrival in the inimitable way that Cos is able to do: with a slow build up of exotic spices, liquorice root, cedar and cassis. It stretches out through the palate and you keep waiting for the tannins to punch through like they did in 2010, but it doesn't happen, even though this is a big wine with high alcohol and an IPT of 80. There's a great menthol freshness on the finish, helped no doubt by a fresh 3.65pH. It has the luxurious signature of Cos, the glamorous touch that you look for in this wine - like at Mouton and at Angelus - that is part of their DNA, but it's also married to elegance and a touch of slate minerality. This is a wine that you would be thrilled to own. 12mm of rain on 12 September and 20mm in mid-August were just enough to stop any blockages in ripening, although the 30hl/ha yield is low due to a touch of mildew and some concentration in September. This compares to a more generous 45hl/ha in 2016. 65% of production went into the grand vin. 1% Petit Verdot makes up the blend, and the wine is aged in 50% new oak (a little lower than the usual 60%).

This is also the first vintage made in the new cellar. Medium to full-bodied, incredibly seamless and elegant on the palate, yet beautifully concentrated, it offers a heavenly perfume of spring flowers, violets, saddle leather, and blueberry and cassis fruit. A blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and the rest Cabernet Franc, brought up in 50% new oak, it\u2019s still tight, taunt, and reserved on the palate, yet has the hallmark purity of fruit and balance of the vintage front and center. Hide bottles for 4-6 years, and it will keep for 25+ years or more. The 2016 Beychevelle is comprised of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc. It spent 18 months aging in 50% new and 50% second-use barrels. Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, it is a little broody to begin, opening slowly to reveal subtle savory notes of dried herbs, charcuterie and black olives before breaking through to a profound core of warm cassis, baked black plums, red currant jelly and candied violets. The palate is medium-bodied and delicately played with a quiet intensity of tightly wound nuances and fantastic freshness, finishing with a lingering savory lift. This latent beauty will require a bit more time than most 2016s, but promises to over-deliver to those prepared to wait. Around 19,000 cases were made.\r\n\r\n Rating: 95+ Stacks of cassis, graphite and smoke on the nose of this rather full-bodied St.-Julien with a ton of velvety tannins that drive the long finish that\u2019s simultaneously sweet, fresh and powdery. Try in 2022. Now with a brand-new, see-through glass winery, this estate is showing its true elegance. The wine does not have great power but it offers a ripe, smooth, sophisticated texture and black fruits. It already shows delicious flavors that will improve. Drink from 2025. This is the first wine made in Beychevelle's new cellars, and when I tasted it at the chateau in July it was excellent, scoring higher than here. This time around we tasted two bottles, as there was a query over brett in the first one. Compared to the July tasting, it's a little bit more difficult to unravel this time around, although there are rich black fruits and attractive layers of frangipane and tar, with high-toned acidity that lifts and sculpts. The tannins do an excellent job of holding all this in place. Matured in 50% new oak. 1% Petit Verdot completes the blend. A yield of 45hl/ha in 2016. This has a slightly beefy edge, with warmed plum and blackberry paste flavors pumping through. Shows a touch of heft on the back end, with dark tobacco and earth notes leaving a subtly chewy feel, though there's ample fruit to soak that up. Best from 2024 through 2038. Very rich upon first nosing with a wealth of dark, slightly plumy fruit framed by lovely oak and laced with elements of toast and carmelized meats, Beychevelle delivers on its terrific aromatic promise with broad, deeply extracted flavors that follow suit. It is at once both showy and unequivocally ageworthy with integral, never-gruff tannins providing proper finishing grip, and it is hard not to get excited about where it looks to be headed with another decade of age.", "rating": "94.14285714285714", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-beychevelle-2016/153336"},

There is no trace of oak here, despite the fact that they are now using at least a half of smaller, 160-liter barrels for the aging of their top wines. The palate delivers all the nose has promised, plus a fine thread and a thin line of acidity making it remarkably fresh. 2013 seems to be the best vintage yet. Bravo! There is no 2012 of Finca Mirador, because the canopy of the vines was destroyed by hail, and the vines could not ripen the grapes without leaves, so they were forced to cut all the unripe bunches and drop them. I wonder if this has something to do with the exceptional performance of Mirador in 2013. A wine with density and sensibility. Full-bodied yet very refined and silky. I love the length and beauty. It's so shy but shows you how beautiful and sexy it is. Better in 2016 but so right now. Piercing blueberry and wild berry aromas are prototypical of this label. A juicy, high-acid palate is linear and a bit edgy, but its composition bodes well for the future. Spiced plum and currant flavors finish with toast, spice and berry notes. Drink through 2024. One of the most elegant and majestic Malbecs in the marketplace, the 2013 Achaval Ferrer Finca Mirador underscores that this grape variety no longer produces just an ordinary black-fruited wine. That was once the case, but times have changed, and vintners are producing wines far exceeding those past expectations. Drinks nicely now.

It was aged for 20 months in wood and comes in with 102 grams of residual sugar. This is a pleasure just to smell, with its hints of herbs, eucalyptus and blackberries. Some more time in bottle has made this a classic Port from start to finish in terms of aromatics and flavors.

It is at perfect phenolic ripeness, supported by refreshing natural acidity balancing the 14.5% alcohol. This will last for decades. From a great vintage for Bolgheri, the 2016 Ornellaia is a classic blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc, and 4% Petit Verdot that was aged 20 months in 70% new French oak. Its saturated purple color is followed by a deep, beautifully concentrated yet primordial effort that offers serious intensity in its cassis, black cherry, graphite, bay leaf, forest floor, and spring flower aromas and flavors. Full-bodied and multi-dimensional on the palate, it has thrilling purity of fruit, ample tannins, and a great, great finish. This is a tour de force in red wine that needs 4-5 years of bottle age and will keep for two decades.\r\n\r\n Rating: 98+ The 2016 Bolgheri Superiore Ornellaia is a wine of extreme complexity and precision. It offers monumental depth with profound layers of black fruit, coffee, licorice and baking chocolate. I tasted this 2016 vintage beside the less-impactful 2015 vintage (which was reviewed last year). These two editions are very different when compared side to side, and this 2016 release is clearly superior in terms of the quality, clarity and intensity of its offerings. This Ornellaia delivers glossy shine and a polished texture that segues to important richness, concentration and textural fiber. It wraps thickly over the palate, imparting waves of sweet dark fruit and dark spice that linger for many long minutes. This beautiful wine is hitting the market now, but collectors will want to put it straight into their cellars for safekeeping. An astoundingly vibrant, powerful and concentrated Ornellaia that has a wealth of intense dark cherries, mulberries and plums with hints of espresso, dark cocoa powder and cedar. The concentrated palate is framed in long, regal tannins that bring focus to the plush, ripe and fresh black cherries and dark plums. Extremely balanced. Best from 2025. Black currant, plum, cedar, lead pencil and toasty, spicy elements highlight this intense red. Muscular tannins line the extended finish, leaving a peppery impression. The parts are all there but need time to integrate. Cabernet\r\nSauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2023 through 2043. Just bottled, the 2016 Ornellaia is a dense, powerful wine. Naturally, the 2016 is just at the beginning of its life, but I am struck by how polished the tannins are for such a young wine. Ornellaia is at its best starting around age ten, but there is little doubt the 2016 is a hugely promising wine. Black cherry, chocolate, plum, new leather and a range of spice notes all build into a veritable crescendo of aromas, flavors and textures.\r\n Rating: 96+ Cedar, French oak and cassis aromas follow over to the vibrant palate along with coconut and dried black cherry. Racy acidity lends energy and youthful tension while firm fine-grained tannins offer elegant support. It\u2019s still young and primary so it give it time to fully develop.

Rose petal, mint, lavender and spice add nuance to a core of red/purplish fruit. Harvest started on September 17 and finished on October 12. Yields were 39 hectoliters per hectare, just shy of the historical average of 42/32. While mildew pressure was an issue, it was the dry October winds and their dehydrating effect on the last Cabernets that impacted yields most. Like so many of his colleagues, Technical Director Frederic Faye and his team opted for gentler vinifications with no SO2 at crush, lower temperatures in fermentation and smaller pumpovers.

These are big tannins but they steal up on you, doing that subtle creep that's such a marker of the vintage.

Packed with ripe, lively plum, blackberry and black currant fruit, backed by melted black licorice and bramble accents throughout, this retains a sense of polish despite the energetic fruit and structure. Ends with an encore of warm plum reduction. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Best from 2023 through 2037. Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2017 Leoville Barton charges out of the gate with bold notions of baked plums, creme de cassis and blueberry preserves plus wafts of pencil shavings, fragrant earth and cedar chest. Medium to full-bodied, the palate delivers mouth-coating black fruit preserves with compelling herbal sparks and a firm, grainy texture, finishing long and lively. Great depth through the mid palate, and as with Poyferr\u00e9 there is both delicacy and finesse to the expression that suggests the style of the vintage emphasizes the classical side of St-Julien. As things open in the glass sweet black cherry with liquorice root and crushed earth comes through in the mid palate. This has poise, concentration and confidence, easily one of the best in the appellation. Inky black colour. Concentrated and super-spicy aromas of coffee and black fruit, with some earth and even tar. Inviting and complex. Big juicy fruit extraction with concentration and depth. Rich black fruit flavours.

Powerful, full-bodied, and concentrated on the palate, it's beautifully done, has ripe, present tannins, and a great finish. It ranks with the gems in this solid vintage and will benefit from just short-term cellaring and cruise for 20-25 years or more in cold cellars. This dark, smoky wine comes from a vineyard close to the walls of Saint-Emilion. The smokiness goes with the impressive core of dry tannins and concentrated structure that supports the rich blackberry flavors. The wine is going to age well; drink from 2024.\t Very pure, with clearly defined plum, blackberry and black cherry preserve flavors gliding through, gently infused with anise and black tea details along the way. The fruit is so seductive you might miss the sneaky, graphite-edged grip that builds through the finish, promising solid cellaring potential. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2022 through 2038. This has a level of composure and energetic fruit on the palate that sets it above the rest in 2017. The nose has fresh blue fruit and hints of graphite and slate. The palate is succulent and juicy, right through to the very long finish. Drink or hold. An impressive Clos Fourtet, delivering in bottle as it did during En Primeur. Plenty of saffron-edged plum and firm tannins, you get the limestone tightness to the texture but it is spliced against fleshy black fruits. I feel pretty sure this will close up tightly over the next few years, and will go the distance in terms of ageing.

This shows richness with structure. Excellent 2017. Try after 2023. A dry wine firm with dark tannins, this is destined for long aging. Concentration and a solid structure are balanced by the dusty texture and dry core. It will take a while for the potential of the juicy black fruits to come through, so this wine needs to wait until 2024. This reminds me of 2001 more than most wines I've tasted, and perhaps it's no surprise that a vintage that required a skilful touch and a belief in the power of elegance should do well at Haut-Bailly. It's hugely pure and restrained, with great aromatics and extremely well placed bilberry, cassis and mulberry fruits. The tannins are fine and poised, set against cigar box with touches of charcoal and slate. They build through the palate, but remain slightly austere on the finish, with a bounce to them that suggests they are going to age beautifully. They kept the vineyard team for three weeks in July, because the vines kept throwing out green shoots after the June rains. Harvested 13-29 September, the vines were around two weeks ahead all the way through the season. The yield was 28hl/ha overall, but only 2hl/ha on the frosted parts, compared to 40hl/ha for the unaffected areas, 50% of production going into the grand vin. Malo was finished by the end of November, but the vats are still separated and there will be final blend in May 2018 (which is what they always do). 4% of Cabernet Franc finishes the blend given below.\r\n Barrel Sample A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 4% Petit Verdot and 4% Cabernet Franc, the 2017 Chateau Haut-Bailly spent 16 months in 50% new French oak.

With medium body, ripe, polished tannins, beautiful elegance and purity, and a great finish, it's a terrific wine in the vintage that will drink well for 25-30 years. A bold tarry note coils around the core of plum, black currant and blackberry fruit, while licorice root and bramble details check in on the finish. Packed and grippy, this is a touch rustic in profile at this early stage but should unwind easily enough with time, as all the pieces are in place.

Brought up in new barrels, it offers stunning notes of pure creme de cassis, unsmoked tobacco, lead pencil, and crushed rocks. Showing a touch of spring flowers with air, full-bodied richness and depth, awesome tannin quality, and a laser-like level of precision and purity, it\u2019s going to need a decade of cellaring yet will have 40-50 years of prime drinking. Hats off to proprietor Bruno Borie for another magical wine. While the dense and dark tannins are prominent, they can\u2019t mask the exuberant fruit that wants to burst out. Blackberry flavors are impressively ripe and rich, shot through with acidity that gives the wine salinity as well as freshness. At the back, those tannins will allow the wine to age over many years. Don\u2019t drink before 2024. Deep ruby in colour, the tannins are confident and there is a good building of layers and power despite the still-evident austerity. As it opens up, you get cigar box, vanilla bean, liquorice, black chocolate and layers of gourmet flavours after a carafe (we tried it with and without). No need to worry too much about that, as you're not going to want to be drinking this yet but it gives a good indication of the fact that this is going to progress well and steadily, and is an excellent example of the vintage.

Medium-bodied, the palate features fantastically vibrant, crunchy black fruits with a firm texture of ripe, grainy tannins and tons of freshness, finishing very long and mineral laced.

These tannins are finely boned but they are plentiful, providing strength in numbers. Bottled end of August after 21 months of ageing.

All these elements combine to yield a wine that shows lush ripeness and crisp firmness, opposing forces creating a certain raciness we like to describe as \u2018tension\u2019.", "reviews": "2016 is one of the best vintages ever in Bolgheri, classic in style and balanced. It has a 'great sense of the classics without denying the past, a fully-fledged, more modern wine,' according to Axel Heinz. Crimson and dense in colour, it's full of restrained, brambly fresh fruit, clove, nutmeg and a salty butteriness, combined with velvety, masked tannins on the palate. It is at perfect phenolic ripeness, supported by refreshing natural acidity balancing the 14.5% alcohol. This will last for decades. From a great vintage for Bolgheri, the 2016 Ornellaia is a classic blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc, and 4% Petit Verdot that was aged 20 months in 70% new French oak. Its saturated purple color is followed by a deep, beautifully concentrated yet primordial effort that offers serious intensity in its cassis, black cherry, graphite, bay leaf, forest floor, and spring flower aromas and flavors. Full-bodied and multi-dimensional on the palate, it has thrilling purity of fruit, ample tannins, and a great, great finish. This is a tour de force in red wine that needs 4-5 years of bottle age and will keep for two decades.\r\n\r\n Rating: 98+ The 2016 Bolgheri Superiore Ornellaia is a wine of extreme complexity and precision. It offers monumental depth with profound layers of black fruit, coffee, licorice and baking chocolate. I tasted this 2016 vintage beside the less-impactful 2015 vintage (which was reviewed last year). These two editions are very different when compared side to side, and this 2016 release is clearly superior in terms of the quality, clarity and intensity of its offerings. This Ornellaia delivers glossy shine and a polished texture that segues to important richness, concentration and textural fiber. It wraps thickly over the palate, imparting waves of sweet dark fruit and dark spice that linger for many long minutes. This beautiful wine is hitting the market now, but collectors will want to put it straight into their cellars for safekeeping. An astoundingly vibrant, powerful and concentrated Ornellaia that has a wealth of intense dark cherries, mulberries and plums with hints of espresso, dark cocoa powder and cedar. The concentrated palate is framed in long, regal tannins that bring focus to the plush, ripe and fresh black cherries and dark plums. Extremely balanced. Best from 2025. Black currant, plum, cedar, lead pencil and toasty, spicy elements highlight this intense red. Muscular tannins line the extended finish, leaving a peppery impression. The parts are all there but need time to integrate. Cabernet\r\nSauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2023 through 2043. Just bottled, the 2016 Ornellaia is a dense, powerful wine. Naturally, the 2016 is just at the beginning of its life, but I am struck by how polished the tannins are for such a young wine. Ornellaia is at its best starting around age ten, but there is little doubt the 2016 is a hugely promising wine. Black cherry, chocolate, plum, new leather and a range of spice notes all build into a veritable crescendo of aromas, flavors and textures.\r\n Rating: 96+ Cedar, French oak and cassis aromas follow over to the vibrant palate along with coconut and dried black cherry.

This hillside terroir escaped from the frost unscathed, and the 2017 is 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc, and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon brought up in mostly new oak. Its deep purple hue is followed by a rock star bouquet of pure creme de cassis, espresso roast, crushed violets, graphite, and a distinct sense of minerality. Deep, full-bodied, and concentrated, it has a wonderful sense of elegance, flawless balance, and again, awesome purity. This sensational effort has some upfront charm yet, given the tannins, a solid 7-8 years of bottle age are warranted and it should cruise for 25-30 years in cool cellars. There was no frost in the vineyard in 2017, due to its situation high upon the limestone plateau. Composed of 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, which was harvested from September 25 to October 3, the 2017 Pavie is very deep garnet-purple in color and rolls slowly and sensuously out of the glass with growing scents of Black Forest cake, black plum preserves, blueberry compote and fruitcake plus suggestions of melted chocolate, licorice, crushed rocks and Indian spices with a waft of violets. Full-bodied, the palate packs a powerful punch, laden with electric layers of energetic black and blue fruits. All this decadent fruit is supported by fantastic freshness and very, very ripe, velvety tannins, finishing with epic length. Location, location, location was everything in 2017. Pavie has one of the most enviable locations in all of Bordeaux and boy-oh-boy does it show in this spectacular wine. Profound, crushed blueberry and blackberry aromas here. Mint and chalk undertones. Full-bodied with a center palate of balanced and ripe fruit with polished and caressing tannins. Excellent finish that goes on for minutes. All in finesse and length. A wine to contemplate and enjoy. Better after 2024.

Voluptuous and showy, but with a very fine chalky minerality pervading on the finish, imparting a sense of grace and refinement. Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.

A low yield of 32hl/ha but not one that is particularly unusual as they rarely go above 35hl/ha here. \u00a0This wine is rich. But it also has a poise and control that balances the richness.

Less open than the Ar\u00f4mes, which is perhaps not surprising as this is in 80% new wood. Monster extraction and depth with tinglingly rich tannins and sweet fruit.

With 97% Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine has a classicism about it: fruity and structured at the same time. Drink from 2024. Deep ruby in colour but not so inky as to be impenetrable - that is not their style. Nose subdued at first, but on the palate it unfurls to show violet edging and rich but well defined black fruits. Lafite never tries overly hard to please everyone in its early years, and this will take some time to open up. There is plenty of concentration - there are hefty tannins but they are so finessed that you don't feel them at first. It will almost certainly take a full ten years to reach its drinking window, unlike many in 2017. Its 97% Cabernet Sauvignon means a lot of the power is implied at this point, with only a hint of Merlot to soften and gently layer up through the palate. Extremely impressive. A yield of 40hl/ha, only very lightly affected by frost. 99% new oak. 3.75pH. Very dark purple colour. Super concentrated aromas of black fruit and spices. Some cinnamon and earth, rosehip and violet. Very concentrated and earthy-spicy with deep black fruit flavours and elegance, deftness of tannins. Balanced, creamy texture with freshness and complexity. Very long\r\nfinish with fine tannins. It\u2019s powerful and flavoursome, but not the equal of the 2016.\r\n Barrel Sample:  95-97 This is a youthful tumble of warmed black currant, fig and blackberry paste flavors, entwined with bay leaf, tobacco, savory, lilac, smoldering charcoal and warm cast iron notes. Terrific stony minerality zips everything up for now, but riveting acidity and excellent energy should carry this easily in the cellar. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Best from 2025 through 2040. The grand vin 2017 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild checks as a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated blend that includes just 2.5% Merlot and less than 1% of Petit Verdot, brought up in new French oak. It shows the classy, elegant style of both the vintage and the estate, revealing a ruby/purple hue, complex notes of red and black currants, lead pencil, and cedary herbs, medium-bodied richness and depth, and both present tannins and acidity. It checks in behind the 2015 and 2016 yet is nevertheless a classic Lafite.

Nonetheless, it has a rightful place in the estate\u2019s lineage of great vintages: it is profound, complex, intense and long. In some respects, it even surpasses our hopes following September\u2019s rainfall and demonstrates yet again to what extent great terroirs are capable of transmitting all their best qualities into the wine.", "reviews": "There is ripeness and opulence to this, in an almost exotic and sassy way. Crushed berries with chocolate and spice. Floral and cashmere undertones. This starts off slowly and just rolls off the palate with beautifully polished tannins and a salty, minerally note to the long, extended tannins. Really brilliant. So classy. Structured. Try after 2025. Despite Margaux being a slightly more difficult region for the Medoc in 2017, this estate has fashioned an incredible 2017 Chateaux Margaux that\u2019s unquestionably in the same league as the 2015 and 2016, and that\u2019s saying something.

With flawless tannins, medium to full body, brilliant concentration, and a great, great finish, it's easily one of the standouts in the vintage. It\u2019s already stunning, yet a good 7-8 years of bottle age are warranted, and it should cruise for 20-25 years in cold cellars. The 2017 Chateau Margaux is a blend of 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot, 2% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot. Deep garnet-purple colored, it needs a little coaxing to reveal alluring notes of blackcurrant cordial, Black Forest cake and black raspberries with suggestions of candied violets, tilled soil, fallen leaves, licorice and espresso plus wafts of underbrush and rosehip tea. Medium-bodied, the elegance and finesse on the palate is simply bedazzling, exuding a quiet intensity of fresh black fruits layered with oh-so-subtle floral and earth nuances. It has a soft, velvety texture and seamless freshness to support the tightly wound flavors, finishing long and perfumed. Beautiful! This grand vin accounts for just 37% of the crop. The 2017 Margaux, matured in 100% new oak, was blended in the second half of February. It has a very pure, floral bouquet with scents of iris and violet infusing the black and subtle blue fruit. There are touches of crushed stone and with aeration, a little candied orange peel. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent ripe tannin, very harmonious in the mouth, caressing and sensual with black fruit, hints of graphite and a light marine influence. There is a fine build to this Ch\u00e2teau Margaux, commencing almost understated but finishing with an insistent grip and a long, quite spicy aftertaste. It's not the bewitching 2015 however, it purrs like a Rolls Royce and will age with panache.\r\n\r\n Barrel Sample:  94-97 Closed in by spicy coffee-ish oak at the moment, with deep brooding fruit underneath. Very intense fruit extraction with beautifully balanced acidity and ripe tannins. Lots of layers of flavour with spices, rich blueberry fruit, cr\u00e8me de m\u00fbre, cinnamon, toast and coffee bean. Tightly packed tannins, but rounded fruit. Very deep and long. Massive, packed deep long finish. A classic Margaux. Elegance and power, perfume and substance. \r\n Barrel Sample:  95-97 Aromas of wood and fresh fruit translate to the palate, giving this wine depth and concentration. It is powerful but also balanced and fresh, displaying the elegance of the vintage. While never overpowering, the wine\u2019s structure will allow it to age well. Drink from 2024 Extremely elegant and finessed spicing on the nose, this has beautiful aromatics, and a seductive lead in. It has added some flesh and creaminess over the ageing, and although you still get fairly high austerity at this point it is becoming well enrobed without sacrificing precision. Good quality and highly enjoyable, this will age effortlessly, fine boned in the 2001 or 2011 sense. 1% Petit Verdot completes the blend, a little lower percentage than usual because they felt structure in the wine was already in plentiful supply. 27% of production. Seamless from start to finish, with a thoroughly caressing mouthfeel to the mix of damson plum, black cherry and black currant fruit, inlaid with a range of lilac, lavender and rooibos tea accents.

This hillside terroir escaped from the frost unscathed, and the 2017 is 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc, and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon brought up in mostly new oak. Its deep purple hue is followed by a rock star bouquet of pure creme de cassis, espresso roast, crushed violets, graphite, and a distinct sense of minerality. Deep, full-bodied, and concentrated, it has a wonderful sense of elegance, flawless balance, and again, awesome purity. This sensational effort has some upfront charm yet, given the tannins, a solid 7-8 years of bottle age are warranted and it should cruise for 25-30 years in cool cellars. There was no frost in the vineyard in 2017, due to its situation high upon the limestone plateau. Composed of 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, which was harvested from September 25 to October 3, the 2017 Pavie is very deep garnet-purple in color and rolls slowly and sensuously out of the glass with growing scents of Black Forest cake, black plum preserves, blueberry compote and fruitcake plus suggestions of melted chocolate, licorice, crushed rocks and Indian spices with a waft of violets. Full-bodied, the palate packs a powerful punch, laden with electric layers of energetic black and blue fruits. All this decadent fruit is supported by fantastic freshness and very, very ripe, velvety tannins, finishing with epic length. Location, location, location was everything in 2017. Pavie has one of the most enviable locations in all of Bordeaux and boy-oh-boy does it show in this spectacular wine. Profound, crushed blueberry and blackberry aromas here. Mint and chalk undertones. Full-bodied with a center palate of balanced and ripe fruit with polished and caressing tannins. Excellent finish that goes on for minutes. All in finesse and length. A wine to contemplate and enjoy. Better after 2024. A stunner, with waves of velvety textured plum sauce, blackberry reduction and warm cassis rolling through, inlaid seamlessly with violet, black tea and singed applewood notes. Voluptuous and showy, but with a very fine chalky minerality pervading on the finish, imparting a sense of grace and refinement. Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Best from 2022 through 2040 Excellent concentration and freshness with linear, rich black fruits. You can really feel the crunchy, impressive layers of cigar box, blackberry and slate. It slowly reveals itself in the glass and is really a lovely wine. This has real persistency, it keeps on revealing itself after it has left your mouth, and is not insisting too much - definite improvement after 18 months ageing, bodes well for the future. 3.6pH. A low yield of 32hl/ha but not one that is particularly unusual as they rarely go above 35hl/ha here. \u00a0This wine is rich. But it also has a poise and control that balances the richness. With its restrained power and black fruits, the wine will develop impressively. Drink from 2024. Inky black colour. Deep and spicy aromas. Less open than the Ar\u00f4mes, which is perhaps not surprising as this is in 80% new wood. Monster extraction and depth with tinglingly rich tannins and sweet fruit.

Awesome notes of orange zest, honeyed flowers, ripe pineapple, peach, and spice all soar from the glass, and this beauty is already complex, has full-bodied richness and power, a great mid-palate, and a beautiful spine of acidity. It's a brilliant, brilliant wine that can be enjoyed today or cellared for two decades or more Intense and richly sweet, this wine is also balanced, with both botrytis and baked-apple acidity coming through.

Just when the harvest was getting underway, the weather conditions were finally perfect: blue skies and prolonged north-northeasterly winds. The grapes were riper than anyone dared hope, and had truly outstanding balance. The vines were in perfect health. To the bracing acidity, concision and aromatic purity expected of the 2008 vintage, Dom P\u00e9rignon adds depth, density and complexity. The light is warmer and less harsh. The opening bouquet is complex and luminous, a mingling of white flowers, citrus and stone fruit. The overall effect is enhanced by the freshness of aniseed and crushed mint. The final aromas offered by the wine are starting to show spicy, woody and roasted notes. After a long period of reluctance, the wine is finally opening up. There is complete balance between the nose and the palate. Its slender, minimalist, pure, toned, athletic character is now also expressed with warmth. The fruit is pronounced and clear. The vintage's characteristic acidity is remarkably well integrated. Its persistence is mainly aromatic, grey, smoky and highly promising. The wine enjoys duality: warmth & freshness, meat & iodine pairings, cooked & raw. Spices enhance and accentuate 2008\u2019s effervescence and densify the wine. Dom P\u00e9rignon likes playful experiences: culinary art, textures, and matters.", "reviews": "COMMENTARY: Dom P\u00e9rignon\u2014a luxury brand that needs no introduction\u2014is going to get even better as it moves through the generational changes with the changing of the guard. While this wine has always sparkled in a class by itself since its inception in 1921, the soon-to-be-released 2008 vintage reflects a transition in the winery's Chef de Cave. After nearly three decades as Cellar Master, Richard Geoffroy is turning the reins over to Vincent Chaperon, and the new guy gets to begin his Dom P\u00e9rignon career with one of Champagne's best vintages. I enjoyed the fortune of tasting this wine twice (9/24/18 and 9/26/18). In the first tasting, the wine seemed young and impenetrable. Time aided it, and it opened up spectacularly. Two days later, in a new situation (and a different bottle, of course), the wine seemed to be even more evocative. In both cases, there is no question this is one of the winery's best efforts. I took more than my usual sips\u2014studying a wine of this magnitude sometimes needs patience. TASTING NOTES. This wind deftly exhibits richness and elegance. Its aromas and flavors of bright apples, light chalk, and yeast autolysis come to the fore along with its and persistent, yet delicate palate presence and long finish should pair it superbly with the fresh toro you bring onto your palate. (Tasted: September 26, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The best Dom since 2002. A vintage with very restrained, powerful style that has been released non-sequentially after the 2009. This has a lighter stamp of highly curated, autolytic, toasty aromas than many recent releases. Instead, this delivers super fresh and intense aromas of lemons, grapefruit and blood-orange peel. Incredible freshness here. The palate has a very smoothly delivered, berry-pastry thread with light, sweet spices, stone fruit and fine citrus fruit. This really delivers. Drink now or hold. The 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon is the first time the estate has released a wine out of order (the 2009 was released before the 2008) but the estate loved the wine so much they felt it warranted additional aging. This is a rich, powerful wine that still shows incredible purity and elegance, with a stacked, concentrated feel on the palate. It\u2019s rare to find such a mix of ripe, pure, concentrated fruit paired with this level of purity, focus, and precision. This is a legendary Dom that surpasses all the great vintages of Dom I have experience with, including the 1990, 1996, and 2002. There's power to this graceful Champagne, with the vivid acidity swathed in a fine, creamy mousse and flavors of toasted brioche, kumquat, pastry cream, candied ginger and poached plum that dance across the palate. An underpinning of smoky mineral gains momentum on the lasting finish. Drink now through 2033. The super-fresh nose combines notions of smoky flint, lemon and wet chalk, yet hints at generosity. Minuscule bubbles create immense creaminess on a palate that dances on its light feet and channels freshness into poise. There\u2019s a promise of future richness and depth, always with ozone freshness and lasting length.\r\nDrinking Window 2020 - 2035 The 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon continues to show very well, offering up a pretty bouquet of Anjou pear, fresh peach, citrus oil, fresh pastry, smoke and iodine. On the palate, it's full-bodied, lively and incisive, with an elegantly textural attack and a creamy core of fruit that's underpinned by a bright but nicely integrated spine of acidity. The finish is long, saline and well-defined. As I wrote earlier this year, this is the finest Dom P\u00e9rignon since 1996, Richard Geoffroy's push for additional ripeness working well with the late-maturing, high-acid vintage. While it can be appreciated young, the 2008 will really start to blossom with five or six years of bottle age.

This is an expressive rendition of Grand Si\u00e8cle that will drink well on release. Whereas the previous three Grand Si\u00e8cles included 2002 in the mix, and the three before that were bolstered by 1996, Iteration 24 has no \u2018superstar\u2019 component and therefore is a sublimation of the concept of a team effort, even if the 2007 represents 60% of the blend, with the '06 and '04 with 20% each. Disgorged in October 2018, the wine is precocious and somewhat undeveloped. Full-bodied and dense, it labours under its primary colours. With time, the wine will flourish and the famous Grand Si\u00e8cle freshness will rejuvenate the ensemble. Patience will assuredly be rewarded!

Bravo! Composed of 92% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot, the 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon Grand Vin State Lane Vineyard sports a deep purple-black color and has a classic nose of crushed black currants, black plums and cedar with hints of dried Mediterranean herbs, underbrush, smoked meats and cloves. Medium to full-bodied, the palate has youthful exuberance with tight-knit, muscular black fruits and spicy suggestions framed by firm, grainy tannins, finishing with great length and depth. Should age incredibly! This aromas are decadent and rich with dark berries, hazelnuts, smoke and spices. Full- bodied, layered and very precise with defined tannins and a fresh finish. Elegant with energy. A driven young wine. Better in 2021 but already a joy to taste. The Grand Vin is so pure, focussed, refined and energetic that it's hard to believe this wine came from such an intense, extracted vintage. The family's State Lane Vineyard is the sole source of their red grapes, and Merlot adds suppleness to the Cabernet. Flavours of black raspberry and Asian spice are accompanied by modest oak influence, a firm backbone of acid and tannin, and a juicy, racy finish.

Best from 2022 through 2042. The 2015 Barolo Bricco Ambrogio is Scavino's cru from this northeastern-most vineyard in the Barolo appellation, in the village of Roddi, and comprises seven hectares of mostly Nebbiolo but also some Dolcetto and Barbera. These vines with their southeastern exposure are not protected from the elements very well, allowing for more diurnal temperature shifts. Therefore, this site always produces much fresher fruit flavors. Indeed, you get noticeably crunchy, tonic fruit here along with a more detailed aromatic portrait. The wine is more precise compared to Monvigliero, for example, which offers more dense fruit, while Bricco Ambrogio is more delicate in the mouth. These soils are gray marlstone, with some yellow veins of clay in there and some sand, whereas Monvigliero soils are far whiter in nature. A fresh Barolo like this would pair well with any fatty sausage. Fragrant purple flowers, rose, wild berries and a whiff of exotic spice form the nose. Elegantly structured, the firm, youthfully austere palate offers dried red cherry, cranberry compote and star anise set against tightly wound, finegrained tannins.

Full-bodied, chewy and rich. A muscular wine that needs time to come together. Better after 2022. The Castello Romitorio 2015 Brunello di Montalcino is a suave and supple expression that shows a slightly more opulent texture compared to many of its peers. The Castello Romitorio vineyards tend to be cool, both in terms of exposure and soils, and the estate shows its best results in a warm and sunny vintage exactly like 2015. You taste the natural richness and exuberance of the fruit, with variety-specific elements of wild cherry, blue flowers and soft earth. The house style prizes more width and latitude in terms of mouthfeel. That attractive medium to full-bodied style is achieved thanks to 24 months of oak aging. At the end of the day, the quality of the fruit is really what shines brightest here. The 2015 Brunello di Montalcino is laced with spicy, dark red fruits, wild, sweet and spicy floral tones that give way to savory herbs, hints of animal musk and black earth. On the palate, it's soft, enveloping, almost creamy in texture and offset by a mix of savory spice, fine tannin and saturating mineral tones as black cherry and sage seem to hover on the senses. The finish is spicy and long, structured, but also with vibrant primary fruits holding on strong, as a twang of savory herbs lingers long. Drinking window: 2022 - 2038. Castello Romitorio sits to the northeast of the town of Montalcino in a rather isolated area. The beautifully restored castle dates back to Roman times and is surrounded by 17ha of vines amidst dense forest. This cool enclave lent refreshing acidity in the warm 2015 vintage. Immediately appealing vanilla, cherry, wild sage and sweet earth notes repeat on the palate, which is dense and concentrated. Fruit is on the lavish, plentiful side but purity is preserved.

It\u2019s already delicious and accessible but will also age well for years to come. Drink through 2035. Polaner Selections. The 2015 Barolo is outrageously beautiful. Best of all, it will drink well with minimal cellaring. Rich, sumptuous and super-expressive, the 2015 is such a showy and expressive wine. Bright red cherry, red plum, blood orange, mint, star anise and dried flowers are all given an extra kick of textural richness in this flashy, exceptionally ripe Barolo. I loved it. Maria Teresa Mascarello remembers the 2015 summer as being very hot, so hot it was hard to get restful sleep at night without air conditioning, especially from the end of June to the first week of August. Temperatures dropped at the end of the season in time to maintain lively freshness and acidity. That interchange between hot and cool contributed to a very successful vintage and steady fruit ripening. Her 2015 Barolo is a tad more accessible overall, with dark and luscious fruit that emerges beautifully from the bouquet. Only the Rue vineyard, one of the blending components for this wine, saw a decrease in yields because of powdery mildew, which can be a problem at that site instead of downy mildew (which is avoided because this vineyard benefits from more winds and breezes). This is also the first vintage in which the San Lorenzo vineyard is not included in the blend. That site went offline in 2015 because the old vines were removed, the earth was left to rest for two years and the site was replanted in 2017. These young Nebbiolo vines may go to a Langhe Nebbiolo wine in the near term, although a final decision has not been made yet. So, to recap, the vineyards used to make this edition are Canubbi (this estate prefers this traditional spelling rather than \"Cannubi\"), Rue, Rocche dell'Annunziata and Bussia (Monrobiolo). A tiny part of fruit from a site in the Barolo township called Nelso is also added (otherwise planted to Dolcetto and Freisa). The wine is put together with amazing precision to offer beautiful fullness, freshness and balance from this textbook growing season. Loaded with licorice, macerated cherry, floral and menthol aromas and flavors, this Barolo is lithe, complex and backed by dense tannins. Balanced overall, with the ripe fruit emerging in the end.

This is a superb showing from proprietor Bob Wilmers and his team headed by V\u00e9ronique Sanders. The decision to lower temperatures in fermentation and go for a soft, gentle extraction, along with strict selection has paid off big time. The 2012 Haut Bailly is brilliant and does nothing to damper my belief that this vintage is underrated in the market. Offering up a classic bouquet of tobacco leaf, cigar wrapper, blackcurrants, lead pencil, and graphite, this beauty is full-bodied, has terrific concentration, integrated acidity and plenty of fine tannins.

The palate is medium-bodied with quite firm tannin, certainly one of the most structured Pessac-L\u00e9ognan wines that I have encountered, yet it is struck through with wonderful balance and focus.

The purity of fruit and finesse and texture of the tannins are all fantastic. Drink in 2019. Very firm and closed up, this wine is a tough proposition at the moment. It has the weight to develop well along with richness. Acidity, sweet fruits and concentrated tannins will all come through strongly as the wine matures. Drink from 2020.  Cellar Selection. Well-stuffed, with thick and muscular brambly structure that easily supports the core of macerated black currant, fig and boysenberry fruit flavors. A tarry edge coats the finish.

Here, the reddish soil is iron-rich, mostly clay and sand with good drainage. Powerful in 2015, the 2016 vintage is youthful and still with assertive clove notes from the fine-grained new French oak. It's a bit warming yet velvety, a full-bodied wine with an amazing mid-palate weight and a great refreshing finish full of cedar notes. This is a beauty with notes of dried meat, dried plums, vanilla and eucalyptus. Full-bodied and very structured on the palate, thanks to muscular tannins. But it\u2019s the acidity that really drives this and keeps you coming back for more and more. A long yet polished finish. A blend of cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc. Drink from 2023. The winemaking team at Poggio al Tesoro has created a beautiful 2016 Bolgheri Superiore Sondraia, fully aware of the potential and profound elegance of this classic vintage. They have been able to harness that quality and express it in terms of the broad and far-reaching intensity of the bouquet. The wine peels back to reveal layer after layer of dark fruit, oak spice, chocolate and sweet tobacco. The wine shows a big personality today, but it is only a teenager. It should be fascinating to watch its future evolution over the next ten years. Black currant, black cherry, raspberry, iron and toasty vanilla aromas and flavors mark this elegant, firmly structured red. Balanced and long, with ripe fruit offsetting the dense tannins. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2020 through 2032. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this leads with aromas of black-skinned berry, bell pepper and Mediterranean brush. The dense palate delivers prune, cassis, licorice and tobacco alongside big, chewy tannins.", "rating": "94.16666666666667", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/poggio-al-tesoro-sondraia-2016/552796"},

In this vintage, Graham\u2019s produced both outstanding Vintage Port (aged in bottle) and Tawny Port (aged in oak casks). This 1963 Single Harvest Old Tawny Port has been aged in seasoned oak casks (barrels) for just over half a century and epitomizes Graham\u2019s hallmark complexity, elegance and balance. The wine was made from grapes grown at Graham\u2019s flagship Douro Valley vineyard in northern Portugal: Quinta dos Malvedos. Intense, deep amber colour. This exquisite multi-layered wine reveals delicate citrus aromas with hints of honeysuckle, black tea and fennel. It is smooth as silk on the palate, showing hints of almonds and walnuts, fruitcake and a soft toffee undertone with a slight minty edge. The finish is unctuous and long with a lingering, exquisite aftertaste. Graham\u2019s 1963 Single Harvest is a fabulous accompaniment to dark chocolate and can also be enjoyed alone, as a dessert in its own right. It is recommended that the wine be served lightly chilled to enjoy it at its best. Once open, the wine will keep in good condition for up to a month.", "reviews": "This wine comes from a legendary year for Vintage Port, so it is fascinating to see how a wine from that year that was only bottled in 2018 has fared. The answer is amazingly. It is luscious and smooth, with fabulous old wood flavors blending with the ripe caramel and acidity. This in itself will be a wine of legend. This is glorious. Superb depth and finesse with balance and density that are so fitting for the greatness of the legendary 1963 vintage. Full-bodied, very sweet yet focused and showing just a hint of tannins. Very long and sweet on the finish. Love the complexity and subtlety of caramel, butterscotch and hints of dried fruits. Fantastic. Stylish, featuring white raisin, white sesame, white ginger and green tea notes leading off, followed by a flash of dried peach. Shows some Sherry aspects, with hazelnut and Brazil nut hints along the edges imparting texture, but this reverts to sweetness soon enough, letting the finish glide through. The 1963 Single Harvest Tawny Port, not yet bottled when seen and set for release in 2019, is a field blend that comes in with 127 grams of residual sugar. A very different wine stylistically than the overachieving 1994, this isn't as rich in a way, but it has a few cards up its sleeve. It adds more of that wonderful complexity that great old Tawnies acquire\u2014molasses, dark chocolate, seared caramel. It's rather fresh for the age too. It has plenty of power and fine acidity supporting the fruit as well. This is pretty beautiful. It will last indefinitely, barring cork failure. From a year made famous by the Vintage wines, this Tawny is markedly fresh and lively, delivering a generous creamy richness that melds textures and flavors into luxurious density. Notes of ripe apricot and fresh herbs last in a brisk, peppery finish.

A powerful palate with dense fruit. Chewy and intense. Needs two or three years to soften. A triumph for the vintage. Drink in 2020. Luciano Sandrone and his daughter Barbara tell me that the 2014 harvest needs explaining. Many are quick to dismiss it given the difficulties of the growing season that saw abundant rain, hail and bombe d'acqua, or \"water bombs,\" which are a dangerous phenomenon with intense rainfall in a very small radius. But hard work does pay off. The Sandrone family employed 38 people for farming, when the average harvest requires only 22 pairs of vineyard hands. Great care was required to keep the leaves and the clusters healthy. The 2014 Barolo le Vigne is bright and fruit-forward. It is perhaps more accessible in the near term compared to past editions. It delivers dark fruit nuances over a mid-weight and compact mouthfeel. Le Vigne blends fruit from crus in four communes (Castiglione Falletto, Serralunga d\u2019Alba, Barolo and Novello), an approach that seems particularly suited to vintages like 2014, when the rain struck some areas more heavily than others. The wine is lush and enveloping, the fruit enlivened by notes of musky wood spice and crushed violets. Firm mineral tannins support the flavors without impeding the juicy fruit. Fragrant, exuding floral, cherry, raspberry and spice notes, with fruit and spice flavors to match. Elements of tar and underbrush sneak in as the muscular structure asserts itself on the long finish.

Frankly, I am surprised this is the first wine of the tasting. Where does one go from here? The 2009 James Berry is a bit of departure from previous vintages. This is the highest percentage of Grenache ever used in the blend, and a large portion of the Grenache was aged in concrete, an approach Smith has borrowed from producers in the Rhone. Originally Smith had intended to age less of the Grenache components in concrete, but the low yields of the vintage forced him to age about two-thirds of the Grenache in concrete. Call it a happy coincidence, but it certainly looks like things turned out well. Readers should do whatever they can to taste this fabulous wine.

Mouth coating intensity, ripe blackberry flavors with a hint of herbs that is the hallmark of wines from Red Mountain. While the wine is big & rich its pleasant mouthfeel is a result of carefully managed tannins which are evident, but seamless. If you prefer wine with lots of fruit, it could be consumed in the near term, or if you like more cedar and cigar box aromas it should be aged for 10 to 15 years. Blend: 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 5% Syrah", "reviews": "The 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon is brilliant stuff and comes from the Klipsun Vineyard on Red Mountain. A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, and 5% Syrah, aged 20 months in new oak, its deep purple color is followed by powerful notes of currants, graphite, toasted spices, and scorched earth. These give way to a full-bodied, concentrated, yet beautifully balanced Cabernet that has fine tannins, terrific purity of fruit, and a great finish. It needs 2-3 years of bottle age but is a 20+ year wine.  Rating:  96+ Refined and impressively structured, with handsome currant, black olive and stony mineral notes that build richness and polish on a lingering finish. Drink now through 2029. A packed Red Mountain wine, this is the first release from the Terlato wine group since it purchased Klipsun Vineyard from David and Patricia Gelles in 2017. This debut leads with rich and tarry oak scents, along with notes of pencil lead, tobacco leaf and purple berries. The flavors are powerful and silky at once, filling out after days open, the tannic grip growing more refined and elegant with air.

A complex nose shows deep, fruity aromas with hints of licorice and roasted coffee. Endowed with a dense and silky tannic structure, this is a full, fleshy wine that provides an ample and generous palate. Its lasting finish speaks of considerable ageing potential. This wine pairs wonderfully with fine meats, roasted beef, water games, truffles and spicy stews. The bottle should be opened 1 to 3 hours before drinking.

Completely destemmed and aged in 40% new French oak, I followed this bottle for multiple days and it continued to gain more and more mid-palate depth, without losing purity or freshness. Give bottles 5-6 years of cellaring and enjoy through 2038. Rating: 94+ This has a very impressive, swirling and aromatic nose of orange zest, fine pepper, gently meaty charcuterie notes, eastern spices and redder berry fruits. Beautifully fragrant.

This beauty has everything you could ask for. As with the 2018, the blend is heavily shifted toward Mourv\u00e8dre, and it offers a mammoth bouquet of black cherries, graphite, cured meats, Asian spices, and assorted garrigue-like nuances. Deep, full-bodied, and concentrated, it stays straight and focused on the palate (whereas the 2016 is more expansive and voluptuous), with a stacked mid-palate, ripe, silky tannins, and fabulous length. You\u2019re going to want bottles of this in the cellar, and comparing the 2007, 2010, 2016, and 2017 over the coming two decades is going to be a treat.  Rating: 98+ As predicted last year by Paul-Vincent Avril, the 2017 Chateauneuf du Pape is a blend of 45% Grenache, 40% Mourv\u00e8dre, about 10% Syrah and the rest other permitted varieties. It boasts a cool, fresh nose of strawberries, cola and tree bark, yet it's full-bodied and tannic on the palate. Dense and chewy, albeit with a mouthwatering sense of freshness, this will need a few years to relax and unwind, but it looks very promising. There's 10% less Grenache in the blend this year, topped up with extra Mourv\u00e8dre which certainly makes itself felt. The final assemblage has a lovely depth and concentration of fruit, and is relatively tannic and structured in this vintage. It has plum and violet lift to the aromatic profile, and perhaps sacrifices a little elegance for power and potency in 2017 - not necessarily a bad thing, depending on your taste. A Clos des Papes for the depths of the cellar. Supple and alluring in feel, with a silky edge to the mix of anise, plum sauce and raspberry p\u00e2te de fruit flavors.

Dried flowers as well. Full body, chewy tannins that are ultra-fine and powerful, yet there is a finesse and beauty to them as I said from barrel. Classic, great nebbiolo. Try in 2023. Balsamic aromas of eucalyptus mingle with enticing scents of wild berry, rose, espresso and tobacco. On the full-bodied, elegant palate, smooth, fine-grained tannins lithely support Marasca cherry, cranberry, star anise and exotic spice while fresh acidity keeps it balanced. One of the best showings I\u2019ve had of Ornato so far. Drink 2021\u20132030. With powerful fruit from Serralunga d'Alba, the 2015 Barolo Ornato is a plush and dense red wine with a contemporary feel that prizes richness and overall accessibility. There is a level of softness here that permeates the entire wine and adds to the already-intense aromas of red fruit, blackberry, spice, tar, asphalt and candied orange peel. This structured Barolo is best tasted with a platter of Alpine cheeses and jellied honey.  Rating: 93+ Piercing scents of cherry, currant, eucalyptus and licorice signal this tightly\r\nwound red. Fluid, with a supple texture that dissolves into a matrix of dense\r\ntannins. The ample sweet fruit lingers nicely. Best from 2022 through\r\n2040. Scents of rose and white smoke lead into vibrant kirsch-like flavors. Mouthwatering acidity fills in around the fruit flavors as notes of dark chocolate, toasted nuts and scorched earth emerge to give a dark, savory tone to the finish.\u00a0\u00a7", "rating": "94.2", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/pio-cesare-barolo-ornato-2015/537269"},

Time in the glass brings out the wine's aromatic nuance and silkiness. The Frog's Leap Cabernet remains an under the radar gem in today's Napa Valley. COMMENTARY: Frog's Leap has been a longtime champion of producing wines of excellent balance. In a world where powerful wines often gain the most adulation, this winery has never ceased making crisp wines with lower alcohols, softer tannins, and food-friendly balance. The 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon is an outstanding wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine lets the fruit from the vines speak, and that it does in volumes.

Dried flower petal nose with savory meaty hints, and captivating tension and freshness on the palate, of ripe and intense red berry-cherry fruit and harmonizing tannins. The 2015 Barolo is a beautifully balanced and tight expression of Nebbiolo that hits all the right spots on the palate, from the side of the mouth where you taste the acidity to the back where you get a sense of the wine's structure and integrated tannins. That freshness could pair well with a steak in pepper cream sauce. Long skin maceration times are followed by oak aging, partially in botti with a smaller part in barrique.

The full-bodied, linear palate shows strawberry compote, wild cherry, licorice and white pepper framed in taut, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2020\u20132027 According to Pio Boffa, his team has worked for more than a decade to identify clones with smaller berries and clusters that give more consistent phenolic ripeness and allow them to pick earlier, which keeps alcohol levels moderate. They have also refined their oak regimen over the years, backing off their use of new French oak barriques in their Barolos so that just 20 percent of the wine rests in new barriques, the rest in large oak casks, for about 30 months. Their efforts show in Pio Cesare\u2019s 2015 releases, some of the best we have tasted from this house. The 2015 Barolo is comprised of fruit from estate vineyards in five communes, including, for the first time, a small percentage from Monforte d\u2019Alba\u2019s Mosconi, acquired by the estate in 2014.

We bottled the wine without fining or filtration, leaving the richness & intensity of the wine to speak for itself.

The fruit is lifted and fresh, although there is a touch of smoke in the background that seemed a bit reductive in nature. It announced that it really is a Reserva with its structure. It tightens fast with aeration and becomes quite gripping on the finish. This is an intriguing Reserva that takes some time to get into, but ultimately it shows extremely well. That bit of smoky funk blew off completely by the next day. The only question will be whether its mid-palate allows it to develop as well as I'd hope. I think it will, as it eventually fleshed out a bit, seeming more elegant than thin. The fine fruit and graceful demeanor will be extremely appealing to many people. It will make a great food wine, too. It should be approachable relatively young, but it does need some time to settle, pull in oak and smooth out some tannins. A plumy blend of tourigas nacional and franca, this feels concentrated without feeling monolithic or heavy.

Despite its forward style, it has plenty of mid-palate oomph and is going to evolve for over a decade. Dark cherry and plum compote notes are furrowed by dark anise and bramble accents, giving this texture and range. Fresh acidity drives this along. Drink now through 2022.

All the grapes for the Anderson Valley wines are grown on the Estate. Each year, the winemaker selects a portion of the best wines for aging in Center of France oak casks. Aged from one to three years, wines from this reserve cellar are added to the blend, creating a multi-vintage cuvee in the traditional Roederer style, known for its body, finesse and depth of flavor.

Its subtle yeasty complexities and its fine, wonderfully persistent mousse are uncommon at the price, and, while a complete and thoroughly enjoyable wine at the moment, it is one that should last and last in the cellar.

Nevertheless, thanks to its privileged coastal location in the Aconcagua Valley -only 40 kilometers away from the Pacific Ocean - the cool breezes that blow in moderated the temperatures. This combination of factors allowed Se\u00f1a to reach perfect ripeness with a unique balance between concentration and power alongside tension, elegance and freshness. Blend: 52% Cabernet Sauvignon 15% Malbec 15% Carmenere 10% Cabernet Franc 8% Petit Verdot", "reviews": "The aromas of blackberries, cedar, sandalwood and black tea are compelling. Black olives.

Fresh and energetic wine in a hot year. Broad-shouldered. Drink after 2022. They explained how the 2017 Se\u00f1a was produced with \"grapes that were handpicked in the morning and transported to the winery in 12-kilogram boxes for a careful inspection on a double sorting table. The grapes fermented in stainless steel tanks at 25 to 31 degrees Celsius (77 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit), depending on the variety and the level of extraction desired. Three pump-overs were carried out daily during fermentation to rotate the volume of the tank 0.5 to 1.5 times. Total maceration time ranged from 15 to 30 days for the Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Carmen\u00e8re and eight to 12 days for the Petit Verdot, according to the development of each block vinified. The final blend was racked to French oak barrels (67% new) and aged for 22 months, during which time malolactic fermentation and stabilization occurred naturally.\" They harvested early and managed to keep the same alcohol level as the 2016. This has less aromatic exuberance and is a more serious vintage with good concentration and weight, not as aerial as the 2016. They increased the amount of wine matured in larger 2,500-liter foudres instead of barrique. This is more powerful, structured and concentrated, like a drier version of the 2015, with some grainy tannins, more acidity, more austerity and less primary fruit. The tannins have some grip (the earlier harvest perhaps?) and might need a little bit of time in bottle, and the wine seems to have what it takes to develop nicely in bottle. They produced 120,000 bottles of this. It was bottled in February and March 2019. Just for the record, the varietal breakdown is 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Malbec, 15% Carmen\u00e8re, 10% Cabernet Franc and 8% Petit Verdot, reflecting a good year for Carmen\u00e8re and Cabernet Franc. Se\u00f1a has always been the most international of Eduardo Chadwick\u2019s trio of premium reds, partly reflecting its genesis as a joint venture with the Mondavis. But it, too, has shifted in style over recent vintages. Yields were very low in 2017, but this is not an overly concentrated, effortful wine. Picked almost three weeks earlier than usual, it\u2019s a very polished cuv\u00e9e of Cabernet Sauvignon with 48% Malbec, Carmen\u00e8re, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.

While fruit is at the center of the wine, it's savory and sophisticated rather than overtly sweet. The flavors touch on small berries - black currants, wild blueberries - and also hint at herbs (terragon, tobacco). This is a terrific vintage of Monte Bello: It feels healthy and sound, with tension and drive that will sustain it for decades in the cellar.

This year\u2019s version of what has become one of California\u2019s iconic Cabernets is introduced in the nose by a fine combination of juicy young fruit, black olives and undisguised oaky sweetness, and its mannerly, multi-layered flavors follow suit. It is surprisingly supple for a wine of its age, and its gentle tannins firm without being intrusive, but a distracting, vaguely toothpicky pucker emerges at the end and warns against hasty drinking.

COMMENTARY: When I first tasted my first vintages of California Chardonnays\u2014vintages 1968 to 1970, I was astounded with the wines' qualities. Historic houses like Heitz, Hanzell, Stony Hill, and others left an indelible mark on my palate. As the California industry grew, Chardonnays got lost a bit. Wineries picked the grapes later and used plenty of oak. My friend and colleague Bob Thompson\u2014one of the world's greatest wine writers\u2014often said, \"I wasn't raised to drink a tree.\" The battle between purity and commercial viability became endless. Fortunately, the 2017 Duckhorn Chardonnay figured it out and produced a wine that hits all of the right points of balance. TASTING NOTES: This wine is generous without sacrificing purity or style. Its aromas and flavors of dried peach, apple, and oak accents are perfectly balanced. Pair it with shellfish in a decadent cream sauce. (Tasted: April 11, 2019, San Francisco, CA) Flavors of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, mango and pineapple give this wine a boost of richness and texture on the palate.

Although I can't claim any extraordinary differences between the two sessions, I noticed a few minimal shifts that are essential to understanding the wine's future aging ability. The 2016 Barbaresco starts off slow at first, showing a small margin of aromatic evolution in the glass. But come back two hours later, and you can almost hear the soft sounds of the symphony playing just below the surface. The 2016 vintage is characterized by the solid intensity and firmness of its aromas, which transcend fruit and veer toward balsamic herb, licorice, tar and smoke instead. The tannins offer a moment of sweetness and softness, before you are aware of their undeniable firmness. In all, there is a certain glossiness or satiny quality to the mouthfeel that underlines the wine's carefully crafted integration. I would describe this as a classic and also a somewhat austere Barbaresco that fully deserves extra cellar time to stretch those tight muscles and grow in volume. This wine will award those who wait. This is all about finesse with power. Such great length here with ever so refined tannins and precise strawberry, cedar, dried-rose and mineral character. Medium body. Fresh and vivid finish. Hard not to drink now, but wait until at least 2021. The Gaja family calls 2016 one of the best vintages they have ever experienced, with a long, slow ripening period without heat stress or disease pressure. That balance comes through in this suave, elegant Barbaresco. It smells of soft rose petals and tastes of juicy cherries and spiced raspberries, the flavors gliding along smooth, ripe tannins. With air, the wine picks up energy and depth, moving into a long, vibrant finish. The 2016 Barbaresco showed beautifully, with a classical yet seductive and sweetly fruited style that's going to evolve gracefully. Medium ruby-hued, with a core of sweet red fruits balanced by classic dried flowers, licorice, asphalt, and medicinal herbs, it hits the palate with medium-bodied richness that carries impress sweet fruit as well as building tannins. Barbaresco doesn't get more classic, and while it has a sunny, sweetly fruited style, it also has ample underlying tannins and structure, so give bottles 4-5 years. It should deliver the goods for two decades or more. The nose is poised, displaying very ripe raspberry and black berry aromas. The attack has intensity, partly thanks to its pungent acidity, but there's no rawness and the tannins are ripe. This is taut and structured and needs time. While concentrated, it's not excessively so, and the wine retains its delicacy through the very long finish.

This wine delivers a lasting sense of structure and intensity that is especially apparent as this Barbaresco hits the palate. The bouquet exhibits signs of ripe fruit with soft layers of blackberry preserves and cherry liqueur. The wine's tannic structure is solid and firmly stitched together, yet this wine is slightly softer and perhaps sweeter than the Riserva Muncagota, for example. This is yet another wine destined for long bottle-aging. This wine seems subdued at first, with a meaty density and powerful, unyielding tannins. After a few hours in the glass, flavors of dark plum and black cherry emerge, gaining momentum as the wine picks up notes of thyme, fennel and black spice. The Montestefano cru\u2019s south-facing slope and the high concentration of calcium in its soils contribute to the wine\u2019s firm concentration, making it a Barbaresco to hide away for a few years while the tannins soften and the complex herbal and spice flavors come to the fore. Lean, intense and racy, this exudes cherry, leather, spice and underbrush aromas and flavors. Dense, beefy tannins shore up the finish, which remains minerally, long and complex.

Although La Panesa is not, strictly speaking, a Fino Amontillado, it has the characteristics of those wines from the past. With an average of 15 years of aging in solera (ten more than most Finos), it takes the lifespan of flor to the limit, creating a wine that\u2019s intoxicating in its mineral and dried-fruit fragrance. Bone dry, saline flavors drive the wine from beginning to end, their abundance leaving no room for sweetness. This is the definition of verticality and elegance. The Fino La Panesa N/V is a reference for old Fino, pushing the limits of biological aging. Bottled at an impressive old age of 15 years from a solera created in 1961, it shows a deep golden color and a nose full of dried nuts (hazelnuts), elegant, complex and balanced, with intense salinity, pungent flavors, a full, wide palate and great length.

{"name": "Prats & Symington Chryseia Douro 2016", "price": 77.99, "abv": "14", "description": "A rich and powerful red with astonishing roundness of tannins. On the nose the fruit is upfront with notes of plum, blackcurrant and a touch of mocha and dark chocolate. The wood is perfectly integrated. The silky and velvety tannins are followed by a very fresh and long aftertaste. A seductive wine even at this early stage with a great ageing potential.", "reviews": "An impressive red that shows finesse to the generous profile of cherry tart, red plum and raspberry gel\u00e9e notes, cast with licorice, Earl Grey tea, pepper and graphite details. Aromas of violet and mocha echo on the tannic finish. Needs a few years in the cellar. Best from 2021 through 2031. Based on the magnificent Quinta de Roriz, this wine is a joint venture between the French Prats family and the Portuguese Symingtons. What has now become an icon wine is made with a nod to Bordeaux, richly structured while also elegant and layering tannins and fruit. It is obviously a wine to age, so wait until 2023. A dynamic vintage of Chryseia, this wine takes Douro fruit toward silkiness without shedding the spicy schist distinction of its tannins or the dark flavors of the local varieties. Floral freshness lives in the silky texture, pointing up the blue and juicy black raspberry flavors while tannic freshness carries the wine\u2019s power, structuring it for development over the next ten years. Charles Symington and Bruno Prats select the fruit for this wine from two estate vineyards, Quinta de Roriz and Quinta da Perdiz, including fruit from another Symington family property, Vila Velha. It\u2019s destemmed and crushed, fermented in stainless steel and aged in new 400-liter French oak barrels, a winemaking regime that brings a Bordeaux perspective to Douro fruit. The 2016 Chryseia is a 60/40 blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca aged for 15 months in mostly (80%) new French oak. It comes in at 14% alcohol. This adds concentration, finesse and intensity to the Post Scriptum this issue, but it is most impressive for its pure essence of fruit. It doesn't seem jammy in terms of concentration, but as you let it sit on your palate, it sure does show off its intense fruitiness. There are no holes in the mid-palate as it finishes. This doesn't seem to me as lifted and as fresh as the 2015, but the concentration level may exceed it. The next question is always the hardest one: Will it turn into really more special as it ages? There, I have some doubts. Let's start here and be a little conservative. It may overtake the 2015 in time\u2014and then again, it may not. It is more or less drinkable now but giving it a bit longer wouldn't hurt.", "rating": "93.5", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/prats-and-symington-chryseia-douro-2016/580883"},

{"name": "Inglenook Rubicon (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2012", "price": 399.99, "abv": "14.5", "description": "Captivating and complex, the 2012 Rubicon boasts very pronounced dark fruit with aromas of currants, black cherries, blackberries, cinnamon, floral notes and the freshness of thyme and other sweet herbs. The palate shows great volume and nicely integrated flavors, fine grained tannins and subtle oak that works beautifully with the fruit. There is softness and delicacy with layered complexity that is constantly evolving. The finish is long and expressive. Blend: 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Petit Verdot, 4% Cabernet Franc, 1% Merlot", "reviews": "The 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon Rubicon, which used to be a proprietary blend and had a somewhat rustic, Italian personality, has now been put under the Inglenook Vineyard designation. Where the Cabernet Sauvignon was a blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Cabernet Franc and 3% Merlot, the Rubicon has abandoned any Italian varietals in favor of a blend of 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Petit Verdot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 1% Merlot. I think it\u2019s safe to say this is potentially the best Rubicon made to date. It\u2019s not to denigrate other vintages, but there is a finesse and elegance combined with great richness and an avoidance of any rusticity that plagued some of the other vintages \u2013 which is to be admired. At three times the price, it\u2019s not three times the wine of the Cask Cabernet Sauvignon. It possesses a dense purple color, beautiful, sweet cr\u00e8me de cassis notes with a floral underpinning. I don\u2019t see any of the Rutherford dust, per se, but there is an undertone of earthiness. The wine is full-bodied, rich, potentially complex and certainly capable of lasting 20 to 30 or more years. This is a great young Rubicon that will have its peak in 5-7 years and last 25-30. The aromas of tar, spice, black currant, blueberry and cedar follow through to a full body with ultra-polished tannins and pointed flavors. Exceptional balance and finesse. Better in 2019 but already gorgeous. Philippe Bascuales worked for two decades with Paul Pontallier at Ch\u00e2teau Margaux before coming to Inglenook in 2011 (since Pontallier passed away this past spring, Bascuales has returned to Ch\u00e2teau Margaux, and is now directing both the Bordeaux property and this Rutherford estate). The pace at which he has transformed the wines is nothing less than astonishing, as if the force of this great Napa Valley site had been waiting to be unleashed. It\u2019s not that the wines were troubled in recent vintages; more that they followed the contemporary Napa Valley story of quality being the pinnacle achievement. The 2008, for example, was \u201csweet, firm and juicy,\u201d with tannins that cushioned the fruit, earning 93 points when I tasted it for the magazine. Bascaules has begun to bring back the voice of the property, a collection of vineyards in the western benchlands of Rutherford, reassembled by Francis Ford Coppola in the pattern of Gustave Niebaum\u2019s original estate. This is the kind of land that made Napa Valley famous. And this is the kind of wine I want to drink. It has the freshness of ripe cabernet sauvignon, with none of the darker, dimpled tones of hyperripe fruit, presenting a delicate red berry scent and the gracious refinement of Rutherford tannins. Some of our tasters reacted to the new oak on the wine, the touch of creaminess French oak brings to the texture, even as they admitted that it was handled with restraint and that the wine showed some tension. The oak is not an issue for me, as the youthful fruit sings through any vessel used to age it, with the message of great vintages to come.", "rating": "95.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/inglenook-rubicon-15-liter-magnum-2012/165880"},

Alcohol: \u00a013.5% The current vintage of one of the flagship wines from La Rioja Alta is the 2009 Vi\u00f1a Ardanza Reserva, the second year it has contained 20% Garnacha grapes from their estate vineyards in La Pedriza in the village of Tudelilla in Rioja Baja. The Tempranillo comes from vineyards averaging 30 years of age in Fuenmayor and Cenicero. The hand-harvested bunches were sorted and put in boxes, transferred to the winery at 14 degrees Celsius to be destemmed and crushed, then the grapes fermented in stainless steel, including malolactic. The two varieties were aged separately, 36 months in used American oak barrels for Tempranillo and 30 months for Garnacha, and racked every six months. It was initially closed, shy and serious, riper and a little darker than the 2008 but still very balanced, serious and harmonious. The palate combines power with elegance, with some tannins, focused flavors, some chalky texture and a rustic touch that gives it character.\r\n Rating: 93+ The 2009 Vi\u00f1a Ardanza is a blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Garnacha from estate vines, vinified separately in stainless steel before being aged in old American oak - the Tempranillo spends 36 months in wood and the Garnacha 30 months, meaning that this wine technically qualifies for Gran Reserva status. Still fairly youthful, it has aromas of vanilla and cedar-tinged macerated cherries, while on the smoothly-textured palate a zesty raspberry acidity provides a spine around which wrap soft red fruits, spicy cedar and fragrant spices. A plush texture carries cherry, strawberry, vanilla, tea and spice flavors in this traditional red. Light tannins and orange peel acidity keep this lively and focused. Spicy and floral notes linger on the finish. Drink now through 2018.", "rating": "93.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/la-rioja-alta-vina-ardanza-reserva-2009/507153"},

Blend: 68% Zinfandel, 18% Carignane, 12% Petite Sirah, 2% Alicante Bouschet", "reviews": "The 2017 Geyserville is a blend of 68% Zinfandel, 18% Carignane, 12% Petite Sirah and 2% Alicante Bouschet, aged 14 months in American oak, 16% new. Medium ruby, it opens with lilac, chocolate box and stone fruit hints with warm blackcurrants, red and black cherries, cranberries, cedar, tobacco leaf and dusty earth. Medium to full-bodied, it opens slowly in the mouth to pure fruits supported by fine, chalky tannins and integrated freshness on the very long finish. This is wound tight but has loads of potential and will require at least another few years in bottle. COMMENTARY: Having tasting nearly all of the vintages of the Ridge Geyserville, I have grown accustomed to the excellence of this wine. While it repositioned itself as a red blend, with lots of Zinfandel, it is still a \"claret-style\" Zinfandel on my palate. The 2017 vintage shows an excellent depth of range and flavors. Its aromas and flavors of dried fruit, bright berries, and subtle earth should pair it nicely with a roast leg of lamb. (Tasted: February 27, 2019, San Francisco, CA) A soft and delicious red with aromas and flavors of blueberries, light chocolate and walnuts. Medium to full body, round tannins and a flavorful finish. 68% zinfandel, 18% carignan, 12% petite sirah and 2% alicante bouschet. Drink now. The 2017 Geyserville is a more pretty, streamlined example of this cuvee and offers plenty of spiced blue fruits, violets, cedarwood, and flowery incense. Medium-bodied, nicely concentrated, with firm focusing tannin, it's a departure from some of the richer, more opulent examples of this cuvee yet is beautifully balanced, has integrated acidity and tannin, and a great finish. 68% Zinfandel; 18% Carignane; 12% Petite Sirah; 2% Alicante Bouschet. Starting off with aromas of a controlled and mannerly cast, but quickly opening up with air to show great depth and a promise of more to come, this wine is a bit brooding yet deeply endowed. Its early blackberry scents gain notes of dark soils, bark and sweet oak over time in the glass, and its full-bodied yet well-balanced construction on the palate could lead some to drink it up now. We would, however, counsel a more patient approach and suggest letting it rest in bottle for some three to six years at a minimum.

Full-bodied, dense and structured with lots of ripe tannins and a long, flavorful finish of currants and forest floor, combined with fresh mushrooms and bark. Needs four to five years to show its true potential. Try after 2024. The 2016 Lynch-Bages delivers on its promise from barrel with an intense blackberry, cedar and mineral-driven bouquet that actually reminds me of Lafite-Rothschild. A faint dark chocolate scent makes a brief appearance. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent ripe tannin, pure black fruit and a velvety texture. There is wonderful structure and focus on the finish, followed by a persistent saline aftertaste. This is an outstanding Lynch-Bages, easily the best since the twin titans of 1989 and 1990.\r\n-Neal Martin Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2016 Lynch Bages comes charging out of the gate with pronounced cassis, chocolate-covered cherries, mulberries and menthol notions, backed up by scents of garrigue, tilled soil and a waft of tapenade. Medium to full-bodied, rich and fantastically concentrated, the generous fruit is superbly framed by firm, ripe, grainy tannins with tons of pepper, cinnamon and cloves layers coming through on the finish. Truly, a legendary Lynch Bages!\r\n\r\n Rating: 97+ This is built for the cellar, with a generous core of kirsch, raspberry paste and plum preserve flavors waiting to unfurl. Will take time, due to the licorice snap, roasted apple wood and sweet tobacco elements draped over the fruit. Should meld with age, as the structure is invigorating in feel, showing both acidity and tannins in lockstep with the fruit. Best from 2025 through 2040. Harvest started a week later than in 2015, allowing a longer, slowing ripening as Pauillac fully benefitted from the conditions of the vintage. Touches of reduction for the first minute emphasise the redcurrant notes in with the cassis and bilberry. The acidity is clear, and the layers of fine tannins build to show an extremely impressive construction: thickly sliced black fruits, fresh menthol, toast, tobacco and grilled, almost tarry almonds. 2% Petit Verdot makes up the blend. Eric Boissenot consults. Rich, jammy and powerful, this wine is all about concentration and firm tannins. Ripe black-currant flavors add great juiciness at the end. The wine has magnificent potential. Drink from 2025.

Saturated purple-colored, with thick black fruits, graphite, and scorched earth aromas and flavors, it fills the mouth with fruit, has masses of tannins, and beautiful overall balance.

The 2016 Vintage Port is a field blend that was set to be bottled about a week after this tasting. It was the final blend, aged for 20 months in wood. It comes in with 104 grams of residual sugar. Tight, powerful and very intense, this is a big boy with the firmness you expect from fine Vintage Port, although the Fonseca is even more powerful. Showing good concentration and a fresh, lifted finish too, this is impressive at the outset. Initially, I was wowed by this. A few more tastes with more air made me think I'd like to see it prove some things in the cellar. It's not hot, but it seems a bit more alcoholic than its Fonseca and Taylor siblings. Still, there's a long way to go before making a final call. As noted, this is very tight, not nearly as approachable as many 2016s are in this relatively restrained year.

The growing season was moderate with spring and summer being warm, but not challenged with heat spikes. The vines looked full and balanced which fooled most growers and winemakers. As soon as we started to pick, we realized this was going to be a monumentally large harvest. With the continuing moderate weather, we let the fruit mature at an even pace.

The aroma grows from very intensely floral in the early years to characteristic \u201cgoudron\u201d as it ages, through a multitude of scents which are always particularly seductive. Probably the most potent of all from Massolino, it perfectly summarises the essential characteristics of Barolo wine, such as grand structure, excellent alcohol concentration and tannins capable of guaranteeing very long ageing. It expresses its best potential when served with meat dishes, rich in intense and persistent aromas and flavours, such as joints of lamb or kid. Also, thanks to its marked tannins, it is simply superb with the bitter-sweet alternation of furry and feathered game. A complex wine, constantly in evolution, capable of guaranteeing unique sensations for refined and demanding palates.", "reviews": "Hailing from one of the most celebrated vineyards in the entire denomination, this focused beauty boasts layers of complexity and depth, starting with its classic Nebbiolo aromas of forest floor, new leather, violet and wild berry.

It's still young but already beautifully balanced, with bright acidity. Cellar Selection First produced in 1982, this is the ace in Massolino's rotation, and the 2013 Barolo Riserva Vigna Rionda is a true standout in the appellation. It is finer, more elegant and more compact than its peers, bringing a spicy personality that belies a profound and deep nature. It's still tense, a little nervous and has some cellar time ahead of it, but this is a beautifully precise wine. This cru site is composed of sedimentary layers of sandy, yellow and ferrous marlstone that absorbs the moisture well. The wine is aged in very mild oak in order to maintain the purity of the fruit and the robust tannins that come naturally to it. This is a real treasure for your cellar. Rating: 97(+) Linear, defined more by structure than flavor today. Lively acidity buoys the cherry, currant, iron and tobacco notes, while refined tannins lend support. Very long and fresh on the finish, but needs a few more years to reach its peak.  Best from 2023 through 2045. Sweet-plum and orange-peel aromas here.

It was not an easy year, one with plenty of rains and maladies, which resulted in a crop that was 15% smaller than the average at Gramona. Their classical 2014 Brut Imperial is a blend of 40% each Xarello and Macabeo with 15% Chardonnay and 5% Parellada that aged sur lie for 51 months in bottle and was adjusted with six grams of sugar to make it a balanced and approachable sparkling. This is one of the flagship wines from Gramona, with a style that is marked by the old wine added in the expedition liqueur, which gives a specific profile that's nutty and has aromas that always make me think of an older wine. They have been moderating the use of this wine, and the touch is subtler, as what they have been using is an infusion of almond peel in this old wine. They never used this expedition wine for III Lustros or Celler Batlle, because they thought the long aging provided enough complexity. However, Imperial has been getting fresher and fresher every year. This is still aged in bottle with a crown stopper, but the magnums keep under cork and all the following wines are aged under cork. There is great freshness, which makes the wine vibrant and tasty, and it has a balanced finish and integrated, small bubbles that provide a creamy texture. And the sugar is almost imperceptible, just adding balance for the acidity. The percentage of Chardonnay will be lower in following years to comply with the Corpinnat requirements. 2014 has to be one of the finest vintages for Imperial. All of the bottles display the disgorgement date and the number of months the wine matured with the lees in bottle. A bright and fruity Cava, suggesting peach pit, lemons and yuzu.

Medium to full-bodied, it fleshes out in the mouth with oodles of ripe fruits and meaty layers, firm, pleasantly chewy tannins and great juicy acidity, finishing long. This has a nice interplay of savory nuances with dense, lush fruits.", "rating": "93.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/piedrasassi-harrison-clarke-vineyard-mourvedre-2017/587087"},
{"name": "Tedeschi Amarone della Valpolicella 2015", "price": 58.99, "abv": "16", "description": "Strong ruby red. Clear and transparent. Notes of vanilla and ethereal airs depending on the period of aging in the barrel; notes of sweet fruits such as currants, blueberries, cherries depending on the varieties of grapes. Wine with a velvety, raisiny character combined with the structure and typical stylish bitterness to give it good balance. It has an enduring and persistent flavor. Blend: 35% Corvina, 35% Corvinone, 20% Rondinella, 10% Rossignola, Oseleta, Negrara, Dindarella.", "reviews": "This wine is made with fruit from outside the Classico zone, from hillside vines planted in well-drained marl soils, with 180-degree exposures from southwest to southeast. The wine's name Marne 180 plays up both of those site-specific attributes. A new wine from Tedeschi, the 2015 Amarone della Valpolicella Marne 180 is slightly more approachable when stacked against the estate's Amarone Capitel Monte Olmi. Offering bright primary fruit with good complexity in the form of spice, tobacco and dried herbs, you could serve the Marne 180 at a holiday party with a platter of French cheeses. Lots of pretty herbal and foresty undertones come to the fore on the nose, ranging from cumin to aniseed and truffles. Dark cherries and brambleberries abound. Plush and chewy, this full-bodied red delivers soft, juicy tannins against a backdrop of ostentatious dark fruit. This leads off with a waft of bay leaf on the nose, followed by an herbal accent that laces the black raspberry, fig cake and spice box flavors on the palate. A firm, medium- to full-bodied red, this is not a powerhouse, but offers pleasant freshness and expression. Corvina, Corvinone, Rondinella and Rossignola.", "rating": "92.33333333333333", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/tedeschi-amarone-della-valpolicella-2015/534270"},
{"name": "Vall Llach Embruix 2017", "price": 29.99, "abv": "15.5", "description": "Sourced from estate-owned 7- to 25-years-old vines, Vall Llach\u2019s Embruix (pronounced Embroosh), means \u201cbewitching\u201d in Catalan and the name, along with the symbol of a full moon on the wine\u2019s label, is testament to the winery\u2019s interesting biodynamic winemaking. Deep cherry red in color with a garnet rim, this wine contains soft aromas of black plumbs, cherry liqueur, freshly milled spice (including clove and black pepper), intertwined with earthy mineral notes. Intense and concentrated for an entry-level Priorat, the Embruix de Vall Llach has well-integrated acidity, round tannins and great structure, assuring this wine will age well for many years.
