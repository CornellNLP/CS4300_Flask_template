Barell Sample : 97-99 This is a powerful wine that shows big tannins and great concentration that are matched with intense acidity. The result is a magnificent wine with the dense fruit flavor and bold structure that will lend well to aging. Barrel Sample:  96-98 Extremely complex, this is tight and holds on with an initial austerity. The plentiful tannins layer up right through the palate, but they are sandwiched by gorgeous blackberry and cassis fruits. There's an inkiness and a spice box feel here, with notes of dried herbs, black olive tapenade and graphite, all generously present. The longer the wine stays in the glass, the more the flesh of the fruit takes precedence and yet the wine manages to also convey a St-Julien classicism.

Full-bodied, rich and densely packed with perfumed black fruit layers, it has a rock-solid backbone of fantastically ripe, grainy tannins and beautiful freshness, finishing very long and minerally. Still very youthful! Almost black in color, this stunning wine is gorgeous, rich and dense. It's grand and powerful, with a strong sense of its own importance. The beautiful tannins and the fragrant black currant fruits are palpable. It's a great wine, with huge potential.  Cellar Selection. This is shy and not giving its all at the moment. Yet it is full and intense with a tightly intertwined tannic and fruit structure. Ethereal blackberry, currant, cedar, and nutty flavors. Dried flowers too. Cedar jewel box smell comes out with time. Great finish. So, so long and harmonious. Try in 2018. The youngest wine we had in the vertical, and clear evidence of how the 10 year rule for classified Bordeaux is far too soon for first growths in great vintages. For Lafite, this was the last great vintage before 2016 came around, and it probably needs another decade to really get into its stride - although five should do it to kick things off. The year began with a wet spring during flowering, so produced lower quantities than 2009. July, August and September were extremely dry with cool nights, perfect for the grapes, with a few touches of rain before harvest. The black fruit notes (cassis barely begins to cover it) have deepened and softened just the merest whisper since its first few years, and it's still extremely young and concentrated. The tannins are starting to take on a truly silky, elevated quality, where the bilberry and blueberry fruit starts to melt right into them, finessed with touches of liquorice and slate. This is hugely complex, and it's very hard to say when this will stop evolving. Rather tight, with an alluring whiff of cocoa that lures you in before disappearing into the core of steeped plum, roasted fig and blackberry coulis notes. Sandalwood, black tea and loam elements fill in on the long and expansive finish. This seems to be lying in wait for what could be a very long time in the cellar before unfurling fully.

This wine has been consistently excellent. The current Special Cuv\u00e9e Brut seems a bit fresher and brighter than past efforts. TASTING NOTES: This wine is beautiful. Its aromas and flavors of ripe apples and light yeasty notes\u2014enhanced with a touch of chalkiness\u2014should make it an excellent choice with clams and linguine in a reduction sauce of white wine,  slivered garlic, and freshly-cracked black pepper.

The mouthwatering finish is long and spicy. Bollinger\u2019s NV Special Cuv\u00e9e knocks it out of the park. Made from 60% Pinot Noir, 25% Chardonnay and the rest Pinot Meunier, with 30% of the blend brought up in barrels, it boasts a rich, deep, medium to full-bodied style as well as terrific notes of lemon curd, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, caramelized stone fruits, and hints of toasty nuttiness that develop with time in the glass. It\u2019s a big, rich Champagne that stays balanced and pure. Beautiful stuff. Fine bubbles combine nicely with the cooked apples, pie crust and lemon rind. Some biscuit, too. Full body. Layered and creamy with a crisp finish. Always delicious. Drink now. As always with this producer, this iconic nonvintage cuv\u00e9e is dominated by Pinot Noir that gives impressive richness as well as ripe stone fruits. Wood fermentation adds further complexity as does the age of this bottling before release. Drink this Champagne now. Cool and generous, this is a bold, lusty Champagne with pinot-inspired scents of violets and flavors of dark berries, the wine structured by its time in oak. It\u2019s a vinous Brut, suited to roast fish and light game. Disgorged in the second half of 2019, the latest release of Bollinger's NV Brut Special Cuv\u00e9e is based on the 2015 vintage, complemented by around 60% reserve wines. The wine is still quite tightly wound after its recent disgorgement, opening in the glass with notes of crisp yellow orchard fruit, freshly baked bread, clear honey and orange peel, with little sign of the nuttiness to come with bottle age. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, muscular and incipiently textural, with a deep core, ripe acids and a pinpoint mousse. This isn't the most incisive vintage of Special Cuv\u00e9e, but it's powerful and vinous and will have fine gastronomic potential with a little bottle age.  Rating: 91+ Bollinger's meaty blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 15% Pinot Meunier, with 25% Chardonnay too, seems a bit at odds with its gorgeously elegant bottle silhouette, modelled after the proportions of the house's magnums.

According to Pio Boffa, his team has worked for more than a decade to identify clones with smaller berries and clusters that give more consistent phenolic ripeness and allow them to pick earlier, which keeps alcohol levels moderate.

Just when the harvest was getting underway, the weather conditions were finally perfect: blue skies and prolonged north-northeasterly winds. The grapes were riper than anyone dared hope, and had truly outstanding balance. The vines were in perfect health. To the bracing acidity, concision and aromatic purity expected of the 2008 vintage, Dom P\u00e9rignon adds depth, density and complexity. The light is warmer and less harsh. The opening bouquet is complex and luminous, a mingling of white flowers, citrus and stone fruit. The overall effect is enhanced by the freshness of aniseed and crushed mint. The final aromas offered by the wine are starting to show spicy, woody and roasted notes. After a long period of reluctance, the wine is finally opening up. There is complete balance between the nose and the palate. Its slender, minimalist, pure, toned, athletic character is now also expressed with warmth. The fruit is pronounced and clear. The vintage's characteristic acidity is remarkably well integrated. Its persistence is mainly aromatic, grey, smoky and highly promising. The wine enjoys duality: warmth & freshness, meat & iodine pairings, cooked & raw. Spices enhance and accentuate 2008\u2019s effervescence and densify the wine. Dom P\u00e9rignon likes playful experiences: culinary art, textures, and matters.", "reviews": "COMMENTARY: Dom P\u00e9rignon\u2014a luxury brand that needs no introduction\u2014is going to get even better as it moves through the generational changes with the changing of the guard. While this wine has always sparkled in a class by itself since its inception in 1921, the soon-to-be-released 2008 vintage reflects a transition in the winery's Chef de Cave. After nearly three decades as Cellar Master, Richard Geoffroy is turning the reins over to Vincent Chaperon, and the new guy gets to begin his Dom P\u00e9rignon career with one of Champagne's best vintages. I enjoyed the fortune of tasting this wine twice (9/24/18 and 9/26/18). In the first tasting, the wine seemed young and impenetrable. Time aided it, and it opened up spectacularly. Two days later, in a new situation (and a different bottle, of course), the wine seemed to be even more evocative. In both cases, there is no question this is one of the winery's best efforts. I took more than my usual sips\u2014studying a wine of this magnitude sometimes needs patience. TASTING NOTES. This wind deftly exhibits richness and elegance. Its aromas and flavors of bright apples, light chalk, and yeast autolysis come to the fore along with its and persistent, yet delicate palate presence and long finish should pair it superbly with the fresh toro you bring onto your palate. (Tasted: September 26, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The best Dom since 2002. A vintage with very restrained, powerful style that has been released non-sequentially after the 2009. This has a lighter stamp of highly curated, autolytic, toasty aromas than many recent releases. Instead, this delivers super fresh and intense aromas of lemons, grapefruit and blood-orange peel. Incredible freshness here. The palate has a very smoothly delivered, berry-pastry thread with light, sweet spices, stone fruit and fine citrus fruit. This really delivers. Drink now or hold. The 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon is the first time the estate has released a wine out of order (the 2009 was released before the 2008) but the estate loved the wine so much they felt it warranted additional aging. This is a rich, powerful wine that still shows incredible purity and elegance, with a stacked, concentrated feel on the palate. It\u2019s rare to find such a mix of ripe, pure, concentrated fruit paired with this level of purity, focus, and precision. This is a legendary Dom that surpasses all the great vintages of Dom I have experience with, including the 1990, 1996, and 2002. There's power to this graceful Champagne, with the vivid acidity swathed in a fine, creamy mousse and flavors of toasted brioche, kumquat, pastry cream, candied ginger and poached plum that dance across the palate. An underpinning of smoky mineral gains momentum on the lasting finish. Drink now through 2033. The super-fresh nose combines notions of smoky flint, lemon and wet chalk, yet hints at generosity. Minuscule bubbles create immense creaminess on a palate that dances on its light feet and channels freshness into poise. There\u2019s a promise of future richness and depth, always with ozone freshness and lasting length.\r\nDrinking Window 2020 - 2035 The 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon continues to show very well, offering up a pretty bouquet of Anjou pear, fresh peach, citrus oil, fresh pastry, smoke and iodine. On the palate, it's full-bodied, lively and incisive, with an elegantly textural attack and a creamy core of fruit that's underpinned by a bright but nicely integrated spine of acidity. The finish is long, saline and well-defined. As I wrote earlier this year, this is the finest Dom P\u00e9rignon since 1996, Richard Geoffroy's push for additional ripeness working well with the late-maturing, high-acid vintage. While it can be appreciated young, the 2008 will really start to blossom with five or six years of bottle age.

Roederer's winemaking style is based on two elements: ownership of its own vineyards and the addition of oak-aged reserve wines to each year's blend or cuvee. All the grapes for the Anderson Valley wines are grown on the Estate. Each year, the winemaker selects a portion of the best wines for aging in Center of France oak casks. Aged from one to three years, wines from this reserve cellar are added to the blend, creating a multi-vintage cuvee in the traditional Roederer style, known for its body, finesse and depth of flavor. The Roederer Estate Brut debuted in October 1988, and has since established its reputation as one of California's premier sparklers, remaining true to the heritage of excellence and style of its French forebears.", "reviews": "Sleek and luxurious, with expressive Asian pear, strawberry blossom and roasted hazelnut flavors that build richness on an opulent finish The Roederer Estate Brut has always garnered a special place amongst the folks in the wine trade. This is my go-to bubbly from anywhere in the New World and often in place of higher price bubblies from France and Italy. Yes, this one is as solid as they come. Medium straw color, refined beads; excellent aroma of ripe apples and light creaminess, maybe even a hint of hazelnut; medium bodied, delicately layered on the palate, excellent structure; dry, fine acidity, well balanced; complex flavors of ripe apples and cream; medium to long finish, fine nuances in the aftertaste.

A flavor of fresh-baked bread and a softer texture develop with time in the glass Year and year out, the Roederer Estate Brut ranks high on the list of preferred non-vintage Brut bottlings and, in this outing, impresses more than usual. It is vibrant and fresh and unstinting in autolyzed richness all at once, and it is as impeccably balanced as it is deep and continuous in flavor. Its wonderfully refined, terrifically sustained mousse heightens its sensations of brightness and youthful vigor, and it shows the complexity and crafting of a wine that we would guess costs far more than it does. I would happily drink this wine every day if there weren\u2019t so many other wines in the world to taste. Its wonderful play of creamy yet kinetic textures, the custardy, limey flavours, and its impeccable focus all add up to one of the best ways possible to greet 6pm after a long work day. Roederer Estate was, in my opinion, the first California sparkling producer to achieve complexity in its wines \u2013 especially in the estate\u2019s prestige cuv\u00e9e, L\u2019Ermitage.

Quietly complex if a little slow to expand on the nose with a mix of red cherries and strawberries infused with subtle notes of dusty soil, this wine surprises a bit by being bigger and richer once in the mouth and musters a far more convincing fruity presence than its slightly introverted aromas predict. While it finishes with enough tannin to commend additional bottle time, it is not too astringent to warn off early drinking, but, that said, its inklings of layering to come are in and of themselves reason enough to exercise three or four years of patience", "rating": "91.2", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/goldeneye-anderson-valley-pinot-noir-2016/517457"},

An absolutely amazing wine, from grapes harvested between the end of September and October 17, this blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot has close to 15% natural alcohol. It comes from one of the few biodynamic vineyards in Bordeaux, but you are likely to see many more, given the success that Tesseron seems to be having at all levels, both in his vineyards and in his fermentation/winemaking. An astounding, compelling wine with the classic Pauillac nose more often associated with its cross-street neighbor, Mouton-Rothschild, creme de cassis, there are also some violets and other assorted floral notes. The wine has off-the-charts massiveness and intensity but never comes across as heavy, overbearing or astringent. The freshness, laser-like precision, and full-bodied, massive richness and extract are simply remarkable to behold and experience. It is very easy, to become jaded tasting such great wines from a great vintage, but it is really a privilege to taste something as amazing as this. Unfortunately, it needs a good decade of cellaring, and that\u2019s assuming it doesn't close down over the next few years. This is a 50- to 75-year wine from one of the half-dozen or so most compulsive and obsessive proprietors in all of Bordeaux. Is there anything that proprietor Alfred Tesseron is not doing right? Talk about an estate that is on top of its game! Pontet-Canet's 2010 is a more structured, tannic and restrained version of their most recent perfect wine, the 2009. Kudos to Pontet-Canet! Dense, yes, but this is also a handsome wine that balances complex tannins with pure black currant fruits that shine. This biodynamic wine has a generous, full and rich feel, ripe with just a touch of restraint. The greatness of the wine shows in its purity with a deceptive simplicity that hides the final complex tannins and structure. The 2010 Pontet-Canet lags behind the 2009, but these two vintages can be hard to compare due the drastically different styles. Where the 2009 is broad, expansive, and showy, the 2010 starts our more reserved and classic in style, with beautiful notes of cassis, cedarwood, lead pencil shavings, tobacco, and damp earth all developing with air. Deep, beautifully concentrated, full-bodied, and powerful, it\u2019s built for the long haul and needs 5-7 years of bottle age, but I suspect will see its 50th birthday in still fine drinking form.\r\n\r\n Rating: 98+ This is big, broad and powerfully rendered, but remarkably polished and refined at the same time.

Rita Hills estate, and is a collection of sixteen pinot noir clones. 40% of the fruit was fermented as whole-clusters with 60% gently de-stemmed in small (1.5 ton) open-top fermenters. Total skin and stem contact averaged 30 days (7 day cold soak, 2 + weeks of fermentation and 1 + week extended maceration). From the press, the wine was transferred directly into neutral barrel (10+ year old French oak), where it remained sur lie without sulfur until June, when it was gently racked for the first time and prepared for bottling in August. Yields were 3.0 lbs/vine (2.9 tons/acre).", "reviews": "The 2016 Pinot Noir Estate is a blend of the seventeen clones on the property.

The bouquet is very expressive and intense, with notes of young red fruit, blackberry and the typical balsamic. In the mouth is full body, persistent and rich, with silky tannins and a superb lenght. A combination of elegance and power, it should be opened at least 2 hours in advance or alternatively decanting gently.", "reviews": "The purity of fruit in this wine really strikes you with black cherries, combined with sage, lavender and rosemary. Extremely aromatic. Full-bodied, yet so tight and polished with incredible tannin structure that gives the wine an endless mouth feel of caressing tannins, acidity and fruit. There\u2019s a fabulous saltiness and oyster-shell undertone to the fruit. Unique. Drinkable already, but this year there\u2019s the structure to last decades. Giacomo Neri and his family have crafted a wine that impresses from the first sip forward (especially when the wine is given ample time to open). The Casanova di Neri 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova must be treated with patience, and that patience is returned with many great rewards. Blackberry, plum and summer cherry are slowly folded into lasting flavors of spice, leather and beautiful balsam or medical herb. These are always a distinctive signature of this estate. The aromas flow with seamless transitions, and that fluid and ever-changing nature of the bouquet is what helps to build intensity and staying power. Fruit is harvested from a south- and southeast-facing slope at 250 to 300 meters above sea level. The soils are mixed loosely with crushed rock, allowing access to air and moisture. Indeed, pretty mineral accents appear as the wine takes on more air in the glass. What stands out most in this Brunello is the quality of the bouquet that is rigid and firm, yet not excessively so. You feel the structural texture of the wine as it sits firmly over the palate, yet there is mobility and softness to its many moving parts. I tasted this wine at various intervals over a 24-hour period. Rating: 98+ Tenuta Nuova has been produced since 1993. It represents Casanova di Neri's 'newer' vineyard of Le Cetine in the southern reaches of Montalcino which boasts stony galestro soils. This manages the warmth and ripeness of the vintage with tremendous sophistication. Balsamic herbs, Mediterranean shrub, juniper and crushed stone overlay layers of focused, luscious currants and black cherries. A bit of an iron fist in a velvet glove - but much more velvet glove than iron fist. Finishes long and invigoratingly salty. The 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova was quite restrained at first, requiring time in the glass to fully blossom, as subtle red berry fruits slowly gain volume and are then complemented by sweet red florals with hints of exotic spice, peppery herbs, and dusty minerals. On the palate, silky textures flood the senses with rich red berry fruits and sweet herbal tones, leaving hints of savory spice and minerals in their wake. The finish is long and unexpectedly fresh, showing the first hints of round tannins under a top note of sweet cherry, plum and a hint of black tea. There is so much going on here, yet it is all densely wrapped up in its youthful state.

Pol Roger owns 200 acres of vineyards, which provide about 45% of their needs. Pol Roger's cellars extend over four miles of winding chalk passageways on two levels. The second or deeper cellar maintains a constant 9.5\u00ba C (50\u00ba F), one degree lower than the first level and most others in the region. This lower temperature slows the second fermentation, encouraging a finer mousse or bubbles. Pol Roger Champagne also spends two to three times the allowable minimum in the cellar before disgorgement, or about three years for the non-vintage and up to seven for the luxury cuv\u00e9es. The long, slow maturation contributes greatly to the complex aromas, which distinguish these superb Champagnes. The Brut Non Vintage blend is traditionally composed from about 30 to 35 still base wines, drawn from different vineyard sites, grape varieties and vintage years. It usually contains wines of at least two vintages, often three or four. Reserve wines compose between 20-30% of the traditional blend. The Brut NV is never sold until the youngest component is at least three years old, which gives it more character and body.

Straw yellow and with a golden hue in color, the Pol Roger NV R\u00e9serve Brut displays a brilliant, perfectly ripe but also fresh, highly elegant and refined fruit aroma on the nose; think of cooked pip fruits like pears and apples, but also quince-confiture and yellow stone fruits, such as apricots and peaches intermixed with vanilla, brioche (pain aux raisins), some nutty flavors and also some white floral notes. On the palate, this medium-bodied Brut is as round (if not pretty sweet) and fruit-driven as it is delicate, pure and very elegant. The mousse is deliciously fine and leads this charming and perfectly balanced fizz to a long, aromatic, stunningly dry and slightly mineral, impressively long finish. This is extremely well done Champagne from equal parts of Pinot Noir, Meunier and Chardonnay sourced in 30 different crus. This R\u00e9serve includes 25% of reserve wines and was dosed with nine grams per liter. A complex, reliable Champagne that would show well in all occasions thanks to its freshness and class. Drawing on all three grapes (chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier), this has a complex grilled-nut and autolysis character overlayed across red berries and citrus fruits. Definitely a lot of reserve wine character here. The palate delivers lemons, grapefruit, peaches and mangoes in a refreshingly pure, fleshy style. The bright acidity, handy balance and tannins smoothly frame the finish. Pol is always a great Champagne to serve to your guests: a classy, balanced expression of the three grape varieties allowed by law. It has plenty of rich apple fruit along with a streak of lemon zest and just a hint of juicy tangerine. The palate is round but fresh, and has a long, steely finish which leaves you wanting another sip. This is a well-balanced, ripe wine in the producer's rich house style.

The palate is rich and dense, balanced by a refined and firm tannic structure, lifted by a juicy and bright acidity.\u201d - Olga Fusari - Winemaker - July 2018 For the 11th edition of Ornellaia Vendemmia d\u2019Artista, it is the American artist Shirin Neshat that interprets the character of Ornellaia 2016 - \u201cLa Tensione\u201d (tension); with her disruptive and poetic visual language, the photographer, filmmaker and video-artist alludes to this vintage\u2019s dynamism and strength through the words of the illustrious 11th century Persian poet, Omar Khayyam.The artist has created a site-specific masterpiece for the Estate, customized a limited series of 111 large format bottles, and designed a special label that, a single example of which, will be found in each Ornellaia case containing 6 bottles of 750ml.", "reviews": "2016 is one of the best vintages ever in Bolgheri, classic in style and balanced. It has a 'great sense of the classics without denying the past, a fully-fledged, more modern wine,' according to Axel Heinz. Crimson and dense in colour, it's full of restrained, brambly fresh fruit, clove, nutmeg and a salty butteriness, combined with velvety, masked tannins on the palate. It is at perfect phenolic ripeness, supported by refreshing natural acidity balancing the 14.5% alcohol. This will last for decades. The 2016 Bolgheri Superiore Ornellaia is a wine of extreme complexity and precision. It offers monumental depth with profound layers of black fruit, coffee, licorice and baking chocolate. I tasted this 2016 vintage beside the less-impactful 2015 vintage (which was reviewed last year). These two editions are very different when compared side to side, and this 2016 release is clearly superior in terms of the quality, clarity and intensity of its offerings. This Ornellaia delivers glossy shine and a polished texture that segues to important richness, concentration and textural fiber. It wraps thickly over the palate, imparting waves of sweet dark fruit and dark spice that linger for many long minutes. This beautiful wine is hitting the market now, but collectors will want to put it straight into their cellars for safekeeping. An astoundingly vibrant, powerful and concentrated Ornellaia that has a wealth of intense dark cherries, mulberries and plums with hints of espresso, dark cocoa powder and cedar. The concentrated palate is framed in long, regal tannins that bring focus to the plush, ripe and fresh black cherries and dark plums. Extremely balanced. Best from 2025. From a great vintage for Bolgheri, the 2016 Ornellaia is a classic blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc, and 4% Petit Verdot that was aged 20 months in 70% new French oak. Its saturated purple color is followed by a deep, beautifully concentrated yet primordial effort that offers serious intensity in its cassis, black cherry, graphite, bay leaf, forest floor, and spring flower aromas and flavors. Full-bodied and multi-dimensional on the palate, it has thrilling purity of fruit, ample tannins, and a great, great finish. This is a tour de force in red wine that needs 4-5 years of bottle age and will keep for two decades.\r\n\r\n Rating: 98+ Black currant, plum, cedar, lead pencil and toasty, spicy elements highlight this intense red. Muscular tannins line the extended finish, leaving a peppery impression. The parts are all there but need time to integrate. Cabernet\r\nSauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2023 through 2043. Just bottled, the 2016 Ornellaia is a dense, powerful wine. Naturally, the 2016 is just at the beginning of its life, but I am struck by how polished the tannins are for such a young wine. Ornellaia is at its best starting around age ten, but there is little doubt the 2016 is a hugely promising wine. Black cherry, chocolate, plum, new leather and a range of spice notes all build into a veritable crescendo of aromas, flavors and textures.\r\n Rating: 96+ Cedar, French oak and cassis aromas follow over to the vibrant palate along with coconut and dried black cherry. Racy acidity lends energy and youthful tension while firm fine-grained tannins offer elegant support. It\u2019s still young and primary so it give it time to fully develop.

It has a core of firm tannins, the straight, focused style of the vintage, and a great finish. Cabernet at this price point can be dicey in 2017, but this is solid and well worth the money. This producer continues to produce outstanding value for the quality in its wines, and this a shining example of the concept. Weighty, expansive tannins give in to a length of rich, rewarding blue and red fruit, the richness well tempered in acidity and a balanced use of oak.

This is a terrific wine and one of the new releases from Montalcino that I happily include on a short list of top recommendations. The Argiano 2015 Brunello di Montalcino shows a very lively bouquet that is already singing despite the young age of this new release. The wine opens to a dark ruby color with garnet highlights. The bouquet shows a large span of wild berry, earth, licorice spice and medicinal herb aromas. This vintage also reveals a pretty floral character with dried rose potpourri and lavender buds. After fermentation, the wine is aged slowly for 30 months in large oak botte (including 10-, 30- and 50-hectoliter capacity), thus restricting oxygen and gently slowing its evolution. However, the 2015 vintage is naturally expressive and exuberant, and that's the main takeaway here. Some 100,000 bottles were filled in May 2019, and the wine hits the market in February 2020.

On the palate, I find velvety textures, ushering in ripe red and black fruits; yet there\u2019s a wonderful balance here, as the wine is lifted by brisk acids, and a mix of savory, spice and minerals notes. The finish is long and structured, buzzing with mouthwatering acid and spice, as dried cherry lingers amidst a coating of youthful tannin. The 2015 Argiano is just a baby, slowly shaking off the wood it was aged in, and it is perfectly balanced. Drinking window: 2022 - 2030.

Vegan", "reviews": "The 2017 Q Malbec wants to showcase the variety in the Valle de Uco using grapes from Altamira and Chacayes. It fermented in concrete vats with indigenous yeasts and with some full clusters that were broken, and it matured in concrete and used French barriques. This differs from the Serie A in the vineyards; here, they look for more texture and less fruit, aiming for sharper and more austere, in the direction of Concreto. It's impressive how the wines from Zuccardi have improved in the last few years and how a wine at this price can have such precision and purity. No excess in any direction. Superb. Pure black plum along with natural dust and spice notes make for an alluring nose. This blend of Malbec fruit from Paraje Altamira and Vista Flores, both subzones of the Valle de Uco, is direct and abrupt on the palate, with grit.

Intense dark chocolate notes linger on the racy finish. Drink now through 2021.

{"name": "Louis Roederer Cristal Brut with Gift Box 2008", "origin": "Champagne, France", "price": 279.97, "abv": "12", "description": "Cristal is Louis Roederer\u2019s flagship cuv\u00e9e. It was created in 1876 and is composed of Grand Crus from the Montagne de Reims, the Marne Valley and the C\u00f4te des Blancs. Cristal 2008 was bottle-aged for 8 years before being left to rest for at least 8 months after disgorging in order to attain perfect maturity. Amber hue with green and orange tints. Fine, even and lively sparkle. Complex and intense bouquet disclosing candied citrus, yellow fruit, Williams pear, pollen, and toasted almond. The delicately seductive bouquet shows intensity and well-honed precision. The wine is powerful, full yet tight, on entry to the palate. The 2008 is undeniably well structured but in a particular way: the wine\u2019s almost saline concentration has not been created by the sun, but is derived from the dryness of the chalk soil in a particularly cool summer. The result is a smooth, almost liquorous, mouthfeel that coats the palate with a powerful yet soft texture. This gives way to an incredible finish, underpinned by freshness and an impression of absolute purity with a taut and very saline character. The Cristal 2008 is deep, intense and masterful. It offers the quintessential reflection of its chalk soils which lend it is velvety texture and delicate tension. This wine\u2019s energy has been tamed by an unusually long period of bottle ageing: Cristal 2008 was in fact aged for 10 years before its release on the market. A first! Blend: 60% Pinot Noir, 40% Chardonnay", "reviews": "This latest incarnation of the famous brand is a superb wine. It is on par with, maybe even better than, the already legendary 2002. Its balance is impeccable: Apple and citrus flavors working with the tight minerality to give a textured yet fruity wine. Produced from Roederer's own vineyards which are mainly biodynamic, the wine has its own intense purity and crispness. It has amazing potential and is likely to age for many years. Drink from 2020.\r\n Cellar Selection Disgorged October 2016 and will be the first Cristal to be released ten years from harvest when it is offered in 2018. 35 parcels used from a possible 45 in this vintage. The assemblage is 60% pinot noir and 40% chardonnay. This is so fresh and tense and mineral with extremely exuberant chardonnay notes on the nose of white peach, lemon and yellow grapefruit, and hints of almost brambly sous bois aromas. The yeast characters are also super fresh, and there are subtle woody notes, with a hint of vanilla bean and light spices. The palate is super long, and very pure, powerful and focused. It drives deep and taut. Pinot noir is a strong core and the chardonnay sits at the edge offering lemon and white nectarine sorbet flavors. Staggeringly concentrated, yet the balance makes it seem airy and light. Acidity is perfectly positioned, and the power is intense and long. This is an ultra precise Cristal, finishing with a mere suggestion of savoriness and warmth to come. Impressive on release, this will be at its best drinking from 2025. The 2008 Cristal is a perfect wine, and Champagne simple does not get any better. This incredible wine offers a beautiful perfume of clean, crisp fruits, layers of complexity in its toasted spice and white flowers, and an utterly seamless, yet powerful style on the palate. This is a rich, decadent expression of Cristal yet it\u2019s still crystalline and elegant, with no sensation of weight, and it just glides over the palate. Haut Couture at its finest and this majestic, profound, legendary Cristal can be drunk anytime over the coming 2-3 decades. Cristal 2008 is on a roll to yet higher levels of exquisite purity and precision of fruit in a paradoxical balance of weightlessness and depth of flavour, permeated with minerals and a salinity reflecting the greatest terroirs of the Roederer estate. Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon believes that 2008 is his best effort to date, and it's easy to see why. It's from a cooler, maritime vintage that came right in the end, with one of the longest harvests ever, running from mid-September to early October. The colour is a stylish pale gold flecked with green. Aromas of white flowers are joined by a cleansing citrus vigour and richer tones of peach and mirabelle. The palate is still quiet, but a tender creaminnes shows through, and there's so much concentration to come if you drink if after 2021. The greatness of the wine owes everything to the influence of organic and biodynamic precepts in the field - and Lecaillon's sleepless perfectionism in the cellar towards finer fruit and a careful brake on too much yeasty expression. The acidity is vibrant but better integrated in the 2008 than in the 1996. Magnificent. Dosage 7.7g/l.\r\nDrinking Window 2021 - 2040 COMMENTARY: Louis Roederer Cristal is an icon amongst all wines made in the world. One mention of the word brings a lifetime of memory to many of us professionals in the wine business. 2008, by all measurements, is widely viewed as one of Champagne's best vintages. When I got the chance to taste this vintage, I was happy to say that the wine lives up to both its reputation and that of the acclaimed year. TASTING NOTES: This wine is riveting. Its aromas and flavors of ripe apple core, creamy accents, brisk minerality, excellent acidity make it one of the winery's best of all time. (Tasted: September 24, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The 2008 Cristal is a real head-turner. Powerful, ample and explosive in all of its dimensions, the 2008 takes hold of the sense and never lets up. There is a crystalline purity to the flavors that is simply remarkable. Although still a baby, the 2008 looks like it will soon take its place alongside the greatest Cristals. Today, it is breathtaking.\r\n Rating: 98+ This expresses a sense of focus and vibrancy to the overall structure, while the palate is all grace and charm. A fine, lacy texture carries a tapestry of ripe white cherry, toast point, blood orange zest, honey and ground ginger notes, with a minerally, mouthwatering finish. A stunning Champagne with a long future ahead of it. Drink now through 2033. Let's start describing the 2008 Cristal technically first. It is a 60/40 blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from 36 plots in seven grands crus: Verzy, Verzenay, Beaumont and A\u00ff for the Pinot Noir and Mesnil, Avize and Cramant for the Chardonnay. Twenty-five percent of the wine was fermented in oak, and 16% underwent malolactic fermentation to moderate the fresh acidity of the 2008 vintage. The assemblage was bottled in May 2009. After 8.5 years on the second lees (longer than any Cristal before), the first release was disgorged in September 2017 with a relatively low dosage of 7.5 grams per liter. \r\n  Rating: 97+", "rating": "98.5", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/louis-roederer-cristal-brut-with-gift-box-2008/427652"},

{"name": "Dom Perignon with Gift Box 2008", "origin": "Champagne, France", "price": 200.0, "abv": "12", "description": "2008 was dominated by grey, overcast skies \u2013 an exception in a decade characterized by bold, generous sunshine. Just when the harvest was getting underway, the weather conditions were finally perfect: blue skies and prolonged north-northeasterly winds. The grapes were riper than anyone dared hope, and had truly outstanding balance. The vines were in perfect health. To the bracing acidity, concision and aromatic purity expected of the 2008 vintage, Dom P\u00e9rignon adds depth, density and complexity. The light is warmer and less harsh. The opening bouquet is complex and luminous, a mingling of white flowers, citrus and stone fruit. The overall effect is enhanced by the freshness of aniseed and crushed mint. The final aromas offered by the wine are starting to show spicy, woody and roasted notes. After a long period of reluctance, the wine is finally opening up. There is complete balance between the nose and the palate. Its slender, minimalist, pure, toned, athletic character is now also expressed with warmth. The fruit is pronounced and clear. The vintage's characteristic acidity is remarkably well integrated. Its persistence is mainly aromatic, grey, smoky and highly promising. The wine enjoys duality: warmth & freshness, meat & iodine pairings, cooked & raw. Spices enhance and accentuate 2008\u2019s effervescence and densify the wine. Dom P\u00e9rignon likes playful experiences: culinary art, textures, and matters.", "reviews": "COMMENTARY: Dom P\u00e9rignon\u2014a luxury brand that needs no introduction\u2014is going to get even better as it moves through the generational changes with the changing of the guard. While this wine has always sparkled in a class by itself since its inception in 1921, the soon-to-be-released 2008 vintage reflects a transition in the winery's Chef de Cave. After nearly three decades as Cellar Master, Richard Geoffroy is turning the reins over to Vincent Chaperon, and the new guy gets to begin his Dom P\u00e9rignon career with one of Champagne's best vintages. I enjoyed the fortune of tasting this wine twice (9/24/18 and 9/26/18). In the first tasting, the wine seemed young and impenetrable. Time aided it, and it opened up spectacularly. Two days later, in a new situation (and a different bottle, of course), the wine seemed to be even more evocative. In both cases, there is no question this is one of the winery's best efforts. I took more than my usual sips\u2014studying a wine of this magnitude sometimes needs patience. TASTING NOTES. This wind deftly exhibits richness and elegance. Its aromas and flavors of bright apples, light chalk, and yeast autolysis come to the fore along with its and persistent, yet delicate palate presence and long finish should pair it superbly with the fresh toro you bring onto your palate. (Tasted: September 26, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The best Dom since 2002. A vintage with very restrained, powerful style that has been released non-sequentially after the 2009. This has a lighter stamp of highly curated, autolytic, toasty aromas than many recent releases. Instead, this delivers super fresh and intense aromas of lemons, grapefruit and blood-orange peel. Incredible freshness here. The palate has a very smoothly delivered, berry-pastry thread with light, sweet spices, stone fruit and fine citrus fruit. This really delivers. Drink now or hold. The 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon is the first time the estate has released a wine out of order (the 2009 was released before the 2008) but the estate loved the wine so much they felt it warranted additional aging. This is a rich, powerful wine that still shows incredible purity and elegance, with a stacked, concentrated feel on the palate. It\u2019s rare to find such a mix of ripe, pure, concentrated fruit paired with this level of purity, focus, and precision. This is a legendary Dom that surpasses all the great vintages of Dom I have experience with, including the 1990, 1996, and 2002. There's power to this graceful Champagne, with the vivid acidity swathed in a fine, creamy mousse and flavors of toasted brioche, kumquat, pastry cream, candied ginger and poached plum that dance across the palate. An underpinning of smoky mineral gains momentum on the lasting finish. Drink now through 2033. The super-fresh nose combines notions of smoky flint, lemon and wet chalk, yet hints at generosity. Minuscule bubbles create immense creaminess on a palate that dances on its light feet and channels freshness into poise. There\u2019s a promise of future richness and depth, always with ozone freshness and lasting length.\r\nDrinking Window 2020 - 2035 The finest release of this iconic cuv\u00e9e since the 1996 vintage, the 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon wafts from the glass with an incipiently complex bouquet of Meyer lemon, green apple, dried white flowers and oyster shell, with only subtle hints of the smoky, autolytic aromas that have been such a prominent signature of recent releases. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and complete, its notable flesh and amplitude controlled by incisive acids, with a youthfully exuberant but elegant mousse and a long, beautifully delineated finish. Considering the sheer size of this cuv\u00e9e, it's a remarkable achievement and a fitting release with which to conclude Richard Geoffroy's tenure as chef de cave. Given the 2008's intensity and balance, I suspect purists will be anticipating later disgorgements with lower dosage and more time on the lees with particular enthusiasm. Tasted three times, with consistent results. Rating: 96+", "rating": "97.16666666666667", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/dom-perignon-with-gift-box-2008/519609"},

People always ask me: What do you do with your wine notes and why do you take so many photographs? Well, I am as crazy as anyone could be about wine, wine history and what wine means to all of us. As I enter the twilight of my life, I am beginning more and more to believe that I was born to tell the story of wine. Every time I visit a vineyard, I feel different, as if the grapes on the vines are talking to me. I had visited Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild on many occasions, but in the spring of 2011, the visit was simply magical. As I sipped the barrel sample of the 2010 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild, I recounted the many times before when I was slightly underwhelmed. This of course is ironic since this is of the grandest wine properties in all the world. But here I was, ready for one of the greatest wine moments in my life. A look, a swirl and a sip later, I was transported into another space and time and now into the 4th dimension. The wine was so amazing, and immediately became my highest rated Bordeaux barrel sample. I gave the wine 99-100 points. Now three years later, I find myself in a perfect job with a new company. I loved my old guys and they took care of me well, but in my newly created position of Chief Storyteller at Wine.com, I found myself in a spot with tasting greater opportunities including a moment in front of a finished bottled of the 2010 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild. I knew I would love the wine, but there were so many famous Bordeaux in the room including Ducru-Beaucaillou, Pichon Lalande, Palmer, and others, that my senses were on overload. Many of these wines were poured. I had also tasted out of barrel in 2011. The anticipation was almost too much. The wine performed magnificently and had reached the pinnacle I had expected. Deep and dark in color as it had been out of the barrel, a miraculous aroma of black currant, steel, chalk and oak, nicely melded and talking to me like no other wine; medium bodied, yet firm, robust and elegant in stature; rich flavors, just beginning to reveal themselves, black fruit, violets, sweet oak, vanilla, mineral and all of those usual suspects, gently folding into each other; long finish, loads of sweet tannins to secure its longevity. Are there any perfect wines? Maybe not, but this is one of the very finest wine experiences ever, from a newly hatched barrel sample in Bordeaux to the finished wine in a bottle in San Francisco, the 2010 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild is of the greatest wines ever! (Tasted: April 28, 2014, San Francisco, CA) A legendary wine, probably one of the best ever. Balance, power, silk. If you and your friends were to splurge on just one wine in your life, this would be a fine choice. This remains the stunner, a battleship of a wine, brimming with cassis, blackberry and fig fruit that has melded together now, with the backdrop of alder, bay leaf and menthol starting to emerge a bit more. The long finish is loaded with grip, pulling the fruit and other components together. And then there's that flash of iron at the very end. Awesome wine.\u2014Non-blind Mouton-Rothschild vertical Deep garnet in color, the 2010 Mouton Rothschild is a little closed to begin, slowly unfurling to reveal notes of baked black cherries, cr\u00e8me de cassis, blackberry compote and bouquet garni with suggestions of sweaty leather, pencil lead, cedar chest and black truffles plus a hint of crushed rocks. Full-bodied, the palate is solidly constructed of super firm, ripe, grainy tannins and lively acidity, framing the densely packed black fruit, finishing on a persistent mineral note. A dense, smooth and opulent wine bursting with ripe Cabernet Sauvignon flavors. It's regal and well structured, balancing the natural exuberance of Mouton with a more severe side. This is a wine with power, yet not without its charms from the fruitiness and final acidity. This great wine will age many, many years.

This unique limited edition of Dom P\u00e9rignon Vintage 2008, designed by Lenny Kravitz, marks the second year of his collaboration with Dom Perignon. Lenny Kravitz elevates the iconic label on the Vintage 2008 bottle by borrowing from the craft of goldsmiths to work hammered metal on the surface of the shield. Dom P\u00e9rignon only creates vintage wines; it is an absolute commitment. Only the best grapes from the most exceptional years are used, making each vintage distinct. It is the perfect embodiment of the Power of Creation \u2013 an act of creation that elevates the mind and enlightens the world.

While this wine has always sparkled in a class by itself since its inception in 1921, the soon-to-be-released 2008 vintage reflects a transition in the winery's Chef de Cave. After nearly three decades as Cellar Master, Richard Geoffroy is turning the reins over to Vincent Chaperon, and the new guy gets to begin his Dom P\u00e9rignon career with one of Champagne's best vintages. I enjoyed the fortune of tasting this wine twice (9/24/18 and 9/26/18). In the first tasting, the wine seemed young and impenetrable. Time aided it, and it opened up spectacularly. Two days later, in a new situation (and a different bottle, of course), the wine seemed to be even more evocative. In both cases, there is no question this is one of the winery's best efforts. I took more than my usual sips\u2014studying a wine of this magnitude sometimes needs patience. TASTING NOTES. This wind deftly exhibits richness and elegance. Its aromas and flavors of bright apples, light chalk, and yeast autolysis come to the fore along with its and persistent, yet delicate palate presence and long finish should pair it superbly with the fresh toro you bring onto your palate. (Tasted: September 26, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The best Dom since 2002. A vintage with very restrained, powerful style that has been released non-sequentially after the 2009. This has a lighter stamp of highly curated, autolytic, toasty aromas than many recent releases. Instead, this delivers super fresh and intense aromas of lemons, grapefruit and blood-orange peel. Incredible freshness here. The palate has a very smoothly delivered, berry-pastry thread with light, sweet spices, stone fruit and fine citrus fruit. This really delivers. Drink now or hold. The 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon is the first time the estate has released a wine out of order (the 2009 was released before the 2008) but the estate loved the wine so much they felt it warranted additional aging. This is a rich, powerful wine that still shows incredible purity and elegance, with a stacked, concentrated feel on the palate. It\u2019s rare to find such a mix of ripe, pure, concentrated fruit paired with this level of purity, focus, and precision. This is a legendary Dom that surpasses all the great vintages of Dom I have experience with, including the 1990, 1996, and 2002. There's power to this graceful Champagne, with the vivid acidity swathed in a fine, creamy mousse and flavors of toasted brioche, kumquat, pastry cream, candied ginger and poached plum that dance across the palate. An underpinning of smoky mineral gains momentum on the lasting finish. Drink now through 2033. The super-fresh nose combines notions of smoky flint, lemon and wet chalk, yet hints at generosity. Minuscule bubbles create immense creaminess on a palate that dances on its light feet and channels freshness into poise. There\u2019s a promise of future richness and depth, always with ozone freshness and lasting length. Drinking Window 2020 - 2035 The finest release of this iconic cuv\u00e9e since the 1996 vintage, the 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon wafts from the glass with an incipiently complex bouquet of Meyer lemon, green apple, dried white flowers and oyster shell, with only subtle hints of the smoky, autolytic aromas that have been such a prominent signature of recent releases. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and complete, its notable flesh and amplitude controlled by incisive acids, with a youthfully exuberant but elegant mousse and a long, beautifully delineated finish. Considering the sheer size of this cuv\u00e9e, it's a remarkable achievement and a fitting release with which to conclude Richard Geoffroy's tenure as chef de cave. Given the 2008's intensity and balance, I suspect purists will be anticipating later disgorgements with lower dosage and more time on the lees with particular enthusiasm.

The nose reveals aromas of red and dark fruit such as blueberry, black cherry and blackcurrant, followed by very lightly toasted notes with a hint of vanilla and spices. The fleshy, powerful attack is balanced by richness and a certain fullness. The tannins are silky, opulent and lengthy, with some crispness. The finish is precise. Altogether it is dominated by the tipycity of the grapes and by tension, and is dense and full-bodied. Blend: 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot", "reviews": "The concentration and largesse of the 2016 Pichon Baron is apparent from the get-go with incredibly alluring, ripe and expansive fruit aromas in the blackberry, dark-cherry, mulberry and plum zone. Espresso and cedar, as well as a slate-like, stony mineral edge add complexity. The palate has incredible depth, drive and detail. Fine and plush tannins stretch the palate in every direction. So fresh and vivacious, this is the greatest Pichon Baron since 1989 and has a long future. Try from 2024. Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2016 Pichon-Longueville Baron offers a suave and seductive nose of warm red and black currants, black plum preserves, truffles, tapenade and rose hip tea with touches of sandalwood and Chinese five spice plus a waft of iron ore. Medium to full-bodied, firmly structured and packed with mineral and exotic spice-laced black fruits, it finishes very long with compelling herbal sparks. As often with this estate, this wine combines opulent richness and an elegant structure. It is a bold wine, ripe and full of black fruits. But it holds together impressively, with nothing in excess. The wine will age well; drink from 2025. \r\n Cellar Selection The 2016 Ch\u00e2teau Pichon-Longueville Baron is beauty and is a blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Merlot that was brought up in 80% new French oak. Tasting like a hypothetical mix of the 2009 and 2010, its deep purple color is followed by a powerful yet sensationally pure bouquet of cr\u00e8me de cassis, blackberries, lead pencil shavings, and graphite, and is just about as quintessentially Pauillac as it gets. Full-bodied, fleshy and even a touch flamboyant, it has sweet tannins and a monster texture that coats the palate. Count me in as a huge fan. This fabulous wine will be relatively approachable in just 3-5 years but will age for 30 years or more. There's no question that we are in Pauillac with this wine: it's a deep, dark purple in colour and a little more reserved on the nose than some, with more of that pencil-lead and slate character. The texture is almost as important as the flavour, and it shows its quality. This is all cassis, wet stone and loganberry, and conveys heft rather than sinew. It tightens through the mid-palate to the point that it contracts - a serious wine. Matured in 80% new oak. This gushes with dark fig and black currant compote flavors backed by lively sweet tobacco and singed alder edges. Very fleshy in feel, though there's ample grip to keep this red grounded, echoing with tar and humus accents through the finish. A thumper.

Pol Roger owns 200 acres of vineyards, which provide about 45% of their needs. Pol Roger's cellars extend over four miles of winding chalk passageways on two levels. The second or deeper cellar maintains a constant 9.5\u00ba C (50\u00ba F), one degree lower than the first level and most others in the region. This lower temperature slows the second fermentation, encouraging a finer mousse or bubbles. Pol Roger Champagne also spends two to three times the allowable minimum in the cellar before disgorgement, or about three years for the non-vintage and up to seven for the luxury cuv\u00e9es. The long, slow maturation contributes greatly to the complex aromas, which distinguish these superb Champagnes. The Brut Non Vintage blend is traditionally composed from about 30 to 35 still base wines, drawn from different vineyard sites, grape varieties and vintage years. It usually contains wines of at least two vintages, often three or four. Reserve wines compose between 20-30% of the traditional blend.

This unique limited edition of Dom P\u00e9rignon Ros\u00e9 Vintage 2006, designed by Lenny Kravitz, marks the second year of his collaboration with Dom Perignon. Lenny Kravitz elevates the iconic label on the Vintage 2008 bottle by borrowing from the craft of goldsmiths to work hammered metal on the surface of the shield. On the Nose: The bouquet is mesmerising, ripe, and deep. The opening notes are a blend of dark spicy notes and cocoa which develop very quickly into fruit aromas. Fruit reigns supreme, with roasted fig and apricot and candied orange. The overall effect exudes smoky accents. On the Palate: The fullness of this wine is immediately striking. Its intensity and succulence set the tone through the sweetness and crispness of the flavors. The silky mouthfeel melts into a smooth, tight, and grainy structure with just a hint of vegetable flavors. This wine expresses an appealing brininess and saline character.", "reviews": "The 2006 Dom P\u00e9rignon Ros\u00e9 is showing well, offering up an expressive bouquet of bitter orange, red berries, apple and a delicate hint of dried flowers and herbs. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, deep and broad, with a fine mousse, ripe acids and chalky phenolic structure, especially on the finish, which testifies to the fully 20% of still red wine that was included in the blend. This is a vinous, gastronomic ros\u00e9 that numbers among the decided successes of the 2006 vintage. Loads of complexity on offer here, from brioche to dried peaches to strawberries and cream and on to rhubarb fool, pomegranate pastries and bread crumbs. The mousse is wonderfully integrated to the edgy peaches and notes that feather the finest line between oxidation and reduction. Very layered and linear, this is an incredibly long and mind-bending Champagne.\u00a0 Where sometimes red fruits dominate and bully the palate of a ros\u00e9 Champagne, with Dom P\u00e9rignon they relax and take a back seat to a nose dominated by spices, figs and the orange grove. The subtlety captured in the gentle rose-gold hue echoes down the palate: softly smoky, richly complex and exceptionally long. \u2018Succulent and structured\u2019 according to Vincent Chaperon, its teasing and almost saline bitterness on the finish underwrites seriousness of intent and gastronomic potential, and presages a long and illustrious future.

Little by little, it evokes stories of distant places, market stalls brimming with unfamiliar fruits, spices and wares, village festivities warmed by the joy of revelers and the setting sun, and sumptuous visions of ladies and their voluptuous curves. A myriad of scents, colors and tastes appeals to the senses. The Grand Vin of Cos d'Estournel is both demure and deliberately sensuous, a fascinating and elegant nectar. Blend: 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc", "reviews": "This is muscular yet so well defined and toned. Full-bodied with deep and dense fruit on the palate, yet powerful and rich at the same time. So much sandalwood and blackberry character. Chewy and rich at the finish. This is a warm and generous wine, but the alcohol is just over 13 degrees. Not that high. Love the finish. Extravagant. Magical. Try from 2025. The 2016 Cos d\u2019Estournel was a bona fide showstopper out of barrel, the best that I had encountered in over 20 years of visiting the estate during en primeur, so my expectations were piled high when I returned to find out how it performs in bottle. Deep, almost opaque in color, it sports a very intense but broody bouquet with fathomless deep black fruit tinged with blueberry and violet. The aromas almost seem to envelop the senses. The palate is medium-bodied with ultra-fine tannin that I have never witnessed in any other vintage of Cos d\u2019Estournel. There is a beguiling symmetry to this Saint-Est\u00e8phe, as well as unerring mineralit\u00e9. The persistent, tobacco-tinged finish can be felt 60 second after the wine has departed. This is a monumental, benchmark Cos d\u2019Estournel that will give not years but decades of pleasure, though I suspect it will close down for a period in its youth, hence my drinking window. 13.07% alcohol. The 2016 Cos d'Estournel is blended of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc aged in 65% new and 35% two-year-old French oak for 15 months. Bottled in July 2018, it is deep garnet-purple colored and starts off a little closed and reticent, opening out slowly and seductively to reveal beautiful lilacs, rose hip tea, crushed stones and camphor nuances over a core of cr\u00e8me de cassis, kirsch, wild blueberries and mocha plus wafts of incense and wood smoke. The palate is simply electric, charged with an energy and depth of flavors that seem to defy the elegance and ethereal nature of its medium-bodied weight, featuring super ripe, densely pixelated tannins that firmly frame the myriad of fruit and floral sparks, finishing with epic length. Just. Magic. The grand vin 2016 Cos d'Estournel checks in as 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot, and 1% Cabernet Franc that saw 70% new French oak.

One of those \u201ciron fists in a velvet glove\u201d wines, with full-bodied richness and beautiful structure that\u2019s covered by thrilling levels of fruit and texture, it stays tight, compact, and incredibly focused on the palate. It\u2019s already brilliant given its purity of fruit and balance, but it deserves a decade of bottle age and will keep for 4-5 decades. This is a little tight right now, as are so many of the 2016s. The fruit is deep, dark and concentrated, with fierce tannins that will take a long time to come around but will age well. There's no question that this is a monumental Cos, with the walls of slate ready to be scaled, joined by a rosemary and black olive tang, juicy liquorice root and lashings of cassis. I tasted this wine both en primeur and again during a vertical at the property in July, and have felt thrilled to recommend it each time. Aymeric de Gironde was still the director at the time, before leaving in 2017. Powerful tannins show strongly in this elegant, structured wine. Rich black-currant and black-plum flavors are lifted by acidity. The wine has weight and concentration, but also is poised and fresh. This combination will allow the wine to age for many years. Drink from 2025.\r\n Cellar Selection This has a core of slightly exotic loganberry, plum and boysenberry fruit laced with singed spice, savory, lilac and incense notes, while a buried chalk-edged minerality sits in reserve.

It might have turned out to be just another generalized blend, but that is not the case here. Rather, the wine has both the focus and the depth that one expects from the better Russian River Valley bottlings. It does suggest that it might drink a bit sooner than DuMOL\u2019s single vineyard bottlings, yet it has the structure and the solid fruit to ask that a half decade and more of patient cellaring be considered. The 2017 Pinot Noir Wester Reach is a gorgeous entry-level wine in this range from DuMol. Joyous and exuberant, with terrific purity of fruit, the 2017 is a real stand out. Crushed red berry, wild flowers and sweet spice all race from the glass in a Pinot that offers so much allure. The aromatics and sweetness here are so alluring. This is a real stand-out. Vineyard sites are the Estate, Dutton, Occidental Road and Widdoes. Drinking window from 2020 - 2029. Incredibly aromatic and complex, the 2017 Pinot Noir Wester Reach offers loads of spiced red fruits, incense, wood smoke, and forest floor notes as well as a medium-bodied, fresh, focused, yet still pleasure bent style. It's a classic DuMol Pinot Noir to drink over the coming 5-7 years. This cuv\u00e9e comes all from the Russian River Valley, from multiple clones, and spent a year in 40% new French oak. The 2017 Pinot Noir Wester Reach is pale to medium ruby with cranberry, crushed black cherry, woodsmoke, oolong tea leaves and pipe tobacco on the nose with notes of earth, strawberry and cola.

There's a great menthol freshness on the finish, helped no doubt by a fresh 3.65pH. It has the luxurious signature of Cos, the glamorous touch that you look for in this wine - like at Mouton and at Angelus - that is part of their DNA, but it's also married to elegance and a touch of slate minerality. This is a wine that you would be thrilled to own. 12mm of rain on 12 September and 20mm in mid-August were just enough to stop any blockages in ripening, although the 30hl/ha yield is low due to a touch of mildew and some concentration in September. This compares to a more generous 45hl/ha in 2016. 65% of production went into the grand vin. 1% Petit Verdot makes up the blend, and the wine is aged in 50% new oak (a little lower than the usual 60%).

In addition, Scharffenberger Cellars has long-term contracts with select vineyards in the greater Mendocino County. This type of vineyard selection allows us to choose from the best vineyards in the area which enables us to produce our trademark cuv\u00e9e. The wine is two-thirds Pinot Noir which produces a red fruit (cherry and plum) forward nose combined with one-third Chardonnay which adds the tropical expression of litchi nut and mango. The 100% malolactic fermentation adds a vanilla cream character producing a round and full-bodied wine.

With opulent Merlot, the wine rolls over the tongue. The balance between freshness and concentration is superb. Velvety, seductive and flavorsome, this wine exhibits all the traits of a great, long-aging vintage. Blend: 85% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Franc, 1% Cabernet Sauvignon", "reviews": "I have been fortunate to follow the 2016 Vieux Ch\u00e2teau Certan almost from the beginning, starting with a tasting of several lots from barrel in early January 2017, in which Alexandre and Guillaume Thienpont showed me the wines in a sequence arranged by the year of planting of various parcels. Even then, it was clear, the 2016 had the potential to be a majestic wine. Now, from bottle, it is every bit as captivating as early tastings suggested it would be. Sweet red/purplish berry fruit, lavender, rose petal and spice infuse this exquisitely beautiful, layered Pomerol. Alexandre Thienpont adds that the harvest was saved by September rains that gave the parched vines just enough water to restore some of the balance that had been lost earlier in the season. Put simply, the 2016 VCC has it all. The 2016 Vieux Ch\u00e2teau Certan is blended of 85% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Franc and 1% Cabernet Sauvignon. Deep garnet-purple in color, it leaps from the glass with pristine, vivid notions of candied violets, chocolate-covered cherries, blackberry compote and mulberries with fragrant touches of raspberry leaves, crushed rocks, licorice, cumin seed and yeast extract plus a waft of red roses. Medium to full-bodied and beautifully elegant, the palate builds from a quiet intensity to an incredibly well-sustained aria of crunchy red and black cherries notes plus tons of floral undertones, framed by exquisitely soft yet firm tannins and seamless freshness, finishing very long with lingering mineral and floral sparks. How does this 2016 compare to the also amazing 2015 vintage? Stylistically they are very different, as my notes on each should convey, but beyond this I am struck by the incredible harmony and seamlessness of the 2016 along with its amazing depth and energy this year. Bravo! Just as good, yet in a different style, the 2016 Vieux Ch\u00e2teau Certan shows cooler notes of cr\u00e8me de cassis, tobacco leaf, underbrush, graphite, violets, and crushed rocks. Deep, incredibly full-bodied and powerful, yet like the 2015, weightless and sensationally textured, it glides over the palate with no sensation of weight or heaviness. Expansive, deep, beautifully concentrated, and flawlessly constructed, it builds incrementally on the palate and has a finish that lasts for over a minute. It\u2019s another legendary wine from this estate to enjoy over the coming 30-40 years. The ripeness in this wine is incredibly balanced and perfect with plum and orange-peel character, buttressed by the ripe seeds of the grapes that give a hazelnut and coffee undertone. Turns to violets. Full body with firm and very sexy tannins that are perfectly balanced and polished. Some chocolate and dried black tea-leaf character in the aftertaste. Wonderful finish. Needs five to six years to soften, but already a joy to experience. Try after 2025. This big, rich wine has perfumed Cabernet Franc flavors to give shape to the dominant Merlot. It is a well-structured wine, elegant and with juicy acidity. It displays power and concentration along with restraint and style. Drink this wine from 2024. This is deep and incredibly silky, with concentrated notes of coffee grounds and cappuccino, liquorice and a welcome touch of bitterness. There's a whoosh of menthol freshness and dark chocolate through the finish. It's intellectual and reserved right now, with some austerity evident, but the complexity builds in the glass, as does the seductive silky texture. This was extremely good at en primeur, but has deepened even further since. Bottled in early June at the property, as they now bottle the wine themselves rather than using a mobile bottling line. 70% new oak. A horse of a different color among its peers in this vintage, featuring an extremely vivid core of pastis-soaked plum, cassis and blackberry fruit streaming forth. Muscular yet imbued with racy cut, the finish ripples along the edges, with sweet tobacco, warm gravel and ganache notes. A violet hint glistens here and there for added effect. Power and vivacity make a thrilling combo. Best from 2023 through 2040.", "rating": "98.71428571428571", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/vieux-chateau-certan-2016/202571"},

Sufficient rain in August alleviated the intense heat and drought conditions of the month of July. Yields were good. The wines are rich and powerful, but lively thanks to a touch of acidity in the reds, the distinctive feature of a magnificent vintage. Game in general, and especially hare, is the kind of meat that pairs ideally with the Cornas wine made by Mr Voge. He suggests this version of Hare \u00e0 la Royale: the saddle stuffed with foie gras and a stewed preparation thickened with blood and the rest of the animal.

It's dense and ripe, defined by serrated tannins, keen acidity and a mouth-coating character. This is full of character, a very classic expression of Cornas that's not massive, but is detailed, clear and sinewy with mineral hints. Seriously good this year.

Lifted notes of black and blue fruits, damp earth, spring flowers, and violets all emerge from this full-bodied, concentrated yet elegant red that stays balanced on the palate, with good acidity. It's another powerful, seriously endowed, pedal-to-the-metal Cornas that will have two decades of longevity.

Concentrated, dense tannins, long, dark-fruit flavors and a bright future. From organically grown grapes. Try in 2022. In almost every vintage, it's worth the price difference to step up to Voge's Vieilles Vignes bottling. Certainly, the 2016 Cornas Vieilles Vignes is another huge success, with hints of cracked pepper and briars accenting red plums and then picking up licorice on the long, softly dusty finish.

Drink or hold. I was able to taste four vintages of the estate\u2019s flagship Cabernet Sauvignon, their Hillside Select. This first growth-like cuv\u00e9e was first made in 1978 and always comes from their estate Hillside Vineyard just above their estate in Stags Leap. This is a 54-acre south-facing, amphitheater-like vineyard of thin, rocky, volcanic soils. Today the cuv\u00e9e is always 100% Cabernet Sauvignon that spends upwards of 32 months in new French oak. It is consistently one of the greatest Cabernet Sauvignons in the world. Starting with their 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon Hillside Select, it boasts a deep, saturated purple hue as well as a heavenly bouquet of sweet blueberry and cassis fruits interwoven with plenty of graphite, tobacco, and lead pencil notes, with ample minerality emerging with time in the glass. This was a hot, low-yielding vintage for Napa, and while this beauty is massively concentrated, it\u2019s also silky and seamless, with great tannins, no sense of over-ripeness or heaviness, and a finish that goes on for nearly a minute. This is a brilliant, incredibly sexy wine to enjoy over the coming 30-40 years. I tasted this as a barrel sample at Premiere Napa Valley just over two years ago, and memory holds: I still recall the dense, almost syrup-like quality of black fruit, earth, and sage. Now released into the marketplace, this heralded 100% Cabernet Sauvignon still has time to develop, but after decanting, it proved more than worthy of praise. The fruit comes from Shafer\u2019s best hillside blocks, and given the dry conditions that year, smaller berries resulted in an extracted expression. Opulent aromas of cedar, leather, and coffee bean are almost Cognaclike, and on the palate, peppered licorice and blackberry perpetuate that syrupy density alongside teeth-gripping, chalky tannins. The elegance rises out of the glass once the wine opens up, exhibiting violets, sagebrush, and sweet meat. Having spent three years in barrel, this 100% varietal wine (from the producer\u2019s famous hillside) is brawny in concentrated black fruit, Christmas spice and thick, firm tannin. A dusty thread of crushed rock, black licorice and flint provide exotic accents to the velvety thick grip.

{"name": "Louis Roederer Cristal Brut with Two Flutes and Gift Box 2008", "origin": "Champagne, France", "price": 329.99, "abv": "12", "description": "Gift pack containing one bottle of 2008 Louis Roederer Cristal Champagne, and two Champagne glasses. The special Cristal glass was co-designed by Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon, Cellar Master of Louis Roederer and Philippe Jamesse, Head Sommelier at Les Cray\u00e8res in Reims. It is produced in limited edition by renowned French glassmaker Lehmann. The unique shape and size allows Cristal its full expression. Cristal is Louis Roederer\u2019s flagship cuv\u00e9e. It was created in 1876 and is composed of Grand Crus from the Montagne de Reims, the Marne Valley and the C\u00f4te des Blancs. Cristal 2008 was bottle-aged for 8 years before being left to rest for at least 8 months after disgorging in order to attain perfect maturity. Amber hue with green and orange tints. Fine, even and lively sparkle. Complex and intense bouquet disclosing candied citrus, yellow fruit, Williams pear, pollen, and toasted almond. The delicately seductive bouquet shows intensity and well-honed precision. The wine is powerful, full yet tight, on entry to the palate. The 2008 is undeniably well structured but in a particular way: the wine's almost saline concentration has not been created by the sun, but is derived from the dryness of the chalk soil in a particularly cool summer. The result is a smooth, almost liquorous, mouthfeel that coats the palate with a powerful yet soft texture. This gives way to an incredible finish, underpinned by freshness and an impression of absolute purity with a taut and very saline character. The Cristal 2008 is deep, intense and masterful. It offers the quintessential reflection of its chalk soils which lend it is velvety texture and delicate tension. This wine\u2019s energy has been tamed by an unusually long period of bottle ageing: Cristal 2008 was in fact aged for 10 years before its release on the market. A first! Blend: 60% Pinot Noir, 40% Chardonnay", "reviews": "This latest incarnation of the famous brand is a superb wine. It is on par with, maybe even better than, the already legendary 2002. Its balance is impeccable: Apple and citrus flavors working with the tight minerality to give a textured yet fruity wine. Produced from Roederer's own vineyards which are mainly biodynamic, the wine has its own intense purity and crispness. It has amazing potential and is likely to age for many years. Drink from 2020.  Cellar Selection The 2008 Cristal is a perfect wine, and Champagne simple does not get any better. This incredible wine offers a beautiful perfume of clean, crisp fruits, layers of complexity in its toasted spice and white flowers, and an utterly seamless, yet powerful style on the palate. This is a rich, decadent expression of Cristal yet it\u2019s still crystalline and elegant, with no sensation of weight, and it just glides over the palate. Haut Couture at its finest and this majestic, profound, legendary Cristal can be drunk anytime over the coming 2-3 decades. Disgorged October 2016 and will be the first Cristal to be released ten years from harvest when it is offered in 2018. 35 parcels used from a possible 45 in this vintage. The assemblage is 60% pinot noir and 40% chardonnay. This is so fresh and tense and mineral with extremely exuberant chardonnay notes on the nose of white peach, lemon and yellow grapefruit, and hints of almost brambly sous bois aromas. The yeast characters are also super fresh, and there are subtle woody notes, with a hint of vanilla bean and light spices. The palate is super long, and very pure, powerful and focused. It drives deep and taut. Pinot noir is a strong core and the chardonnay sits at the edge offering lemon and white nectarine sorbet flavors. Staggeringly concentrated, yet the balance makes it seem airy and light. Acidity is perfectly positioned, and the power is intense and long. This is an ultra precise Cristal, finishing with a mere suggestion of savoriness and warmth to come. Impressive on release, this will be at its best drinking from 2025. COMMENTARY: Louis Roederer Cristal is an icon amongst all wines made in the world. One mention of the word brings a lifetime of memory to many of us professionals in the wine business. 2008, by all measurements, is widely viewed as one of Champagne's best vintages. When I got the chance to taste this vintage, I was happy to say that the wine lives up to both its reputation and that of the acclaimed year. TASTING NOTES: This wine is riveting. Its aromas and flavors of ripe apple core, creamy accents, brisk minerality, excellent acidity make it one of the winery's best of all time. (Tasted: September 24, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The 2008 Cristal is a real head-turner. Powerful, ample and explosive in all of its dimensions, the 2008 takes hold of the sense and never lets up. There is a crystalline purity to the flavors that is simply remarkable. Although still a baby, the 2008 looks like it will soon take its place alongside the greatest Cristals. Today, it is breathtaking.  Rating: 98+ Cristal 2008 is on a roll to yet higher levels of exquisite purity and precision of fruit in a paradoxical balance of weightlessness and depth of flavour, permeated with minerals and a salinity reflecting the greatest terroirs of the Roederer estate. Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon believes that 2008 is his best effort to date, and it's easy to see why. It's from a cooler, maritime vintage that came right in the end, with one of the longest harvests ever, running from mid-September to early October. The colour is a stylish pale gold flecked with green. Aromas of white flowers are joined by a cleansing citrus vigour and richer tones of peach and mirabelle. The palate is still quiet, but a tender creaminnes shows through, and there's so much concentration to come if you drink if after 2021. The greatness of the wine owes everything to the influence of organic and biodynamic precepts in the field - and Lecaillon's sleepless perfectionism in the cellar towards finer fruit and a careful brake on too much yeasty expression. The acidity is vibrant but better integrated in the 2008 than in the 1996. Magnificent. Dosage 7.7g/l.\r\n Drinking Window 2021 \u2013 2040 This expresses a sense of focus and vibrancy to the overall structure, while the palate is all grace and charm. A fine, lacy texture carries a tapestry of ripe white cherry, toast point, blood orange zest, honey and ground ginger notes, with a minerally, mouthwatering finish. A stunning Champagne with a long future ahead of it. Drink now through 2033. Let's start describing the 2008 Cristal technically first. It is a 60/40 blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from 36 plots in seven grands crus: Verzy, Verzenay, Beaumont and A\u00ff for the Pinot Noir and Mesnil, Avize and Cramant for the Chardonnay. Twenty-five percent of the wine was fermented in oak, and 16% underwent malolactic fermentation to moderate the fresh acidity of the 2008 vintage. The assemblage was bottled in May 2009. After 8.5 years on the second lees (longer than any Cristal before), the first release was disgorged in September 2017 with a relatively low dosage of 7.5 grams per liter.\r\n Rating: 97+", "rating": "98.5", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/louis-roederer-cristal-brut-with-two-flutes-and-gift-box-2008/552981"},

The overall wine is easy to drink but made with as much seriousness and as many individual layers as any Riesling that Red Newt releases.  The philosophy is simple; a crowd-pleasing wine should still be multifaceted.", "reviews": "COMMENTARY: Wine professionals love Riesling, but this grape variety has had its ups and downs in the marketplace. Many consumers have historically thought of this wine as merely a sweet and fruity beverage; the best wines often reach the highest levels of accolades in the wine world. The Red Newt Circle Riesling is as good as it gets. Positioned between an off-dry Kabinett and a medium sweet Spatl\u00ebse, the 2017 vintage exhibits outstanding balance. TASTING NOTES: This wine is fresh, bright and charming. Its aromas and flavors of ripe apples, dried peach skin, fragrant flowers, and chalk should pair it supremely with ginger-onion cold-boiled chicken over jasmine rice. (Tasted: January 14, 2019, San Francisco, CA) The 2017 Circle Riesling is a blend of vineyards (Tango Oaks and Lahoma) coming in at 31 grams per liter of residual sugar and 7.5 of total acidity, plus 10.5% alcohol. This is supposed to be Red Newt's easy-drinking label, on the sweeter side and with a larger production (4,000 cases). Yet it has always performed well. Maybe this year it performs even better? I hesitate to be so optimistic about the entry-level, but it seems terrific this year. There is enough acidity\u2014it does have some tension on the finish on opening\u2014to herd the sugar into controlled lanes. It is fresh and fun yet just a little distinguished as well. It is transparent and adds a touch of stones on the finish. It drank beautifully the next day as well, although admittedly it did show better on the first day. Overall, it's another super bargain from Red Newt (and the Finger Lakes) this issue.", "rating": "90.5", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/red-newt-cellars-circle-riesling-2017/518912"},

Around 55% of the wine was aged in new French oak barrels, 15% in two-year-old barrels and 35% in cement amphorae for 16 months. Deep garnet-purple colored, it opens with opulent scents of plum preserves, spice cake, hoisin and cr\u00e8me de cassis with fragrant wafts of potpourri, wood smoke and rose hip tea. Medium to full-bodied, rich and decadent, with loads of spicy layers, it has a firm, velvety texture with great freshness and incredible depth, finishing very long and on a compelling mineral note. The 2016 is a vintage that shows off the best of Pontet, and is similar in feel to their 2010. Gorgeously rich right from the first nose, it opens stunningly in the glass, showing waves of tight black fruits, touches of redcurrant, liquorice and aniseed, fine tannins and mouthwatering salinity. It manages to remain balanced without losing the punch and concentration of Pauillac, rising up through the palate.

Drinking Window\u00a02026\u00a0-\u00a02042 Reminding me of the 2010 and, I suspect, a wine that will merit a triple-digit rating in a decade or so (I tasted this on multiple occasions and thought it was perfect on one of them), the 2016 Ch\u00e2teau Pontet-Canet comes from 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc, and the balance Petit Verdot that spent 16 months in 50% new French oak, 35% in concrete amphora, and the rest in second fill oak. Thrilling notes of pure cr\u00e8me de cassis, lead pencil shavings, crushed mint, graphite, and crushed rock notes all emerge from this deep, powerful, yet elegant Pauillac. The style of this wine has become more and more finesse-driven and pure, yet it hasn\u2019t lost a beat on concentration or length. This singular, beautiful Pontet-Canet needs 7-8 years of cellaring (it has some accessibility today given its purity and balance) and will keep for 4-5 decades.\r\n\r\n Rating: 98+ The aromas of ripe blackcurrants, iodine, sweet tobacco and fresh flowers are spellbinding. Full-bodied with mouth-expanding, massive and natural tannins. Impressive fruit with hints of prunes. The finish is long and powerful. Needs six to seven years to soften and come together. Try from 2025. This is sappy and rich in feel, with waves of red and black currant preserves, raspberry and bitter plum coulis. The long finish drips with sweet tobacco and anise notes, while a brambly layer courses underneath. The vivacious finish kicks into second gear as the fruit and grip come together. Best from 2023 through 2038.", "rating": "97.66666666666667", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-pontet-canet-2016/202522"},

Then again, we are talking about 2015. Although perhaps not the most classic expression of Ovello, the Produttori's 2015 is very nicely done. Best of all, it will drink well with just a few more years in bottle. This is an especially heady, exotic Ovello Barbaresco that needs to shed some baby fat, its considerable appeal today notwithstanding. Ovello is the northernmost vineyard in the Barbaresco commune - and the largest. It was one of the original five vineyards individually bottled in 1967 by Produttori. The clayey soils and exposure to the cool northern winds gives this wine a full body and structured tannins. The 2015 features a woody, vanilla-toned fragrance with some delicate cherry fruit.

A reduced center palate that is so compact with dark fruit, dark mushrooms and cedary spice. Full body. Wonderfully polished tannins and a long, long finish. Electric acidity. Muscular and well toned. The is a new classic that reminds me of great Spanish wines from the 1940s and 1950s. Better after 2021, but already so impressive. The latest in a string of brilliant Prado Eneas from Jorge Muga, this comes from the bodega's coolest and highest vineyards, up to 600 metres in some cases, and will age every bit as well as its distinguished predecessors. Dense, dark and brooding, with chalky minerality and a finish that lingers on the tongue. 2021-35 The most classical of the wines from Muga, the 2011 Prado Enea Gran Reserva comes from a warm year that here was cooler than 2012, when they did not produce it. There won't be a 2013 either. So after this 2011, the following vintage will be 2014 but with fewer bottles and then 2015 and 2016. The wine has a developed nose with some tertiary notes, combined with some notes of ripe black fruit and sweet spices. It fees like an open, expressive and hedonistic year for Prado Enea. The palate reveals polished tannins and some balsamic and developed flavors, truffle, forest floor and hints of cigar ash and incense. Stylistically, this could be close to the 2006, which was also surprisingly fresh for the average ripeness found in Rioja in general. 92,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in early 2015 after almost 40 months in barrel. Time in bottle has polished the wine, and it's ready to drink on release, but it's a wine that is going to develop in bottle for a long time. The 2011 Prado Enea checks in as a blend of 80% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacha, Mazuelo that spent a full three years in oak, followed by three years in bottle before being released in May of 2019. It reveals a deep ruby/plum color as well as a closed, tight nose of blackcurrants, smoked earth, graphite, and Asian spices. It's rich, medium to full-bodied, has a layered, balanced texture, integrated tannins, and a great finish. It's holding things a little close to its vest at the moment, so I suspect 2-4 years of bottle age are warranted.\r\n95+ Aromatic and alluring, this generous red offers forest floor, tobacco and floral notes that frame a core of black cherry, plum, licorice and orange peel flavors.

Again, it's a blend of 2009, 2010 and 2012, with 50% of the Chardonnay sourced from Cattier\u2019s own vineyards in Montagne de Reims, and the other 50% from the C\u00f4te des Blanc - mostly from the village of Cramant. This is definitely more complex, rounder and richer than your average Blanc de Blancs. Grapefruit and white flower aromas come to mind. While opulent, it is focussed, with tremendous depth wrapped up by a backbone of acidity. A hardly noticeable dosage of 8g/l.\r\nRead more at https://www.decanter.com/wine-reviews/france/champagne/armand-de-brignac-ace-of-spades-blanc-de-blancs-champagne-19333#YZWB5Aq6bZIWDR6z.99", "rating": "92.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/armand-de-brignac-ace-of-spades-silver-blanc-de-blancs-with-gift-box/127175"},

A classic Rioja born in the twenties. Imperial is only elaborated in excellent vintages in Rioja Alta. Intense garnet color with bluish notes on the meniscus. In the nose we discover a perfect aromatic balance where the fruits of the forest and licorice stand out along with the aromas from pine, cigar leaf and sweet spices. Through the palate it is marked by a soft tannin followed by a long and elegant finish, which leads us to a balsamic aftertaste leaving us the memory of a round and balanced wine able to be paired with cheeses, red meat, game and fatty fish, even to take simply with someone else. Blend: 85% Tempranillo, 10% Graciano, 5% Mazuelo", "reviews": "This is a fabulous gran reserva from a very good but lightly heralded vintage. Aromas of spiced plum, black olive, fig, tobacco and cassis come together like a puzzle. A deep, pure palate shows near-perfect balance, while this tastes of plum berry fruits and earthy spice. Smooth, elegant and chocolaty on the finish, this delivers all one can ask for from Rioja. Drink through 2035. Editors' Choice Vivid ruby-red. Highly perfumed aromas of red fruit liqueur, candied flowers, vanilla and incense; spicecake, vanilla and smoky mineral flourishes emerge with air. Palate-staining raspberry, cherry-vanilla and rose pastille flavors display excellent depth and energy, and a spine of juicy acidity provides added lift and back-end cut. Melds richness and vivacity with a sure hand and finishes with lingering sweetness, fine-grained tannins and a touch of smokiness. I'm always looking forward to tasting CVNE's Gran Reserva bottlings, especially the 2011 Imperial Gran Reserva, as the year was highly praised, and I was very curious to see how it behaved. It's a classical blend of Tempranillo with 10% Graciano and 5% Mazuelo that matured in barrel for two years. It has good depth and complexity in the nose, nicely layered, very balsamic and tertiary. It feels elegant and harmonious. The palate is surprisingly fresh and vibrant, with finesse, freshness, fine and mostly resolved tannins and a fine thread of acidity that holds and lifts up the finish. \r\n  Rating: 93+ Imperial focuses on CVNE\u2019s bush vines in the Rioja Alta town of Villalba, including fruit from some mature parcels nearby in Briones and Montalvo. A blend of tempranillo (85 percent), graciano and mazuelo, it ferments in French oak vats, then ages three years in French and American oak barrels, followed by long aging in bottle before release. In fact, it needs more bottle age, as the wine is reduced, with a rubber scent when first poured. That reduction doesn\u2019t get in the way of the tense, purple-black fruit or the mineral power of the tannins. And by the next day, the reduction is gone, leaving a luxurious red wine in its wake, deep and silken, smoky and refined, while still tough in its structure. Built for long development in bottle, the top vintages of Imperial live for decades. This red has density and balance. Harmonious flavors of black cherry, plum, licorice, underbrush and tea mingle over well-integrated tannins, giving way to a fresh, spicy finish. Not showy, but has energy.

This is also the first vintage made in the new cellar. Medium to full-bodied, incredibly seamless and elegant on the palate, yet beautifully concentrated, it offers a heavenly perfume of spring flowers, violets, saddle leather, and blueberry and cassis fruit. A blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and the rest Cabernet Franc, brought up in 50% new oak, it\u2019s still tight, taunt, and reserved on the palate, yet has the hallmark purity of fruit and balance of the vintage front and center. Hide bottles for 4-6 years, and it will keep for 25+ years or more. The 2016 Beychevelle is comprised of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc.

Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, it is a little broody to begin, opening slowly to reveal subtle savory notes of dried herbs, charcuterie and black olives before breaking through to a profound core of warm cassis, baked black plums, red currant jelly and candied violets. The palate is medium-bodied and delicately played with a quiet intensity of tightly wound nuances and fantastic freshness, finishing with a lingering savory lift.

The wine does not have great power but it offers a ripe, smooth, sophisticated texture and black fruits. It already shows delicious flavors that will improve. Drink from 2025. This is the first wine made in Beychevelle's new cellars, and when I tasted it at the chateau in July it was excellent, scoring higher than here. This time around we tasted two bottles, as there was a query over brett in the first one. Compared to the July tasting, it's a little bit more difficult to unravel this time around, although there are rich black fruits and attractive layers of frangipane and tar, with high-toned acidity that lifts and sculpts. The tannins do an excellent job of holding all this in place. Matured in 50% new oak. 1% Petit Verdot completes the blend. A yield of 45hl/ha in 2016. This has a slightly beefy edge, with warmed plum and blackberry paste flavors pumping through. Shows a touch of heft on the back end, with dark tobacco and earth notes leaving a subtly chewy feel, though there's ample fruit to soak that up. Best from 2024 through 2038. Very rich upon first nosing with a wealth of dark, slightly plumy fruit framed by lovely oak and laced with elements of toast and carmelized meats, Beychevelle delivers on its terrific aromatic promise with broad, deeply extracted flavors that follow suit. It is at once both showy and unequivocally ageworthy with integral, never-gruff tannins providing proper finishing grip, and it is hard not to get excited about where it looks to be headed with another decade of age.", "rating": "94.14285714285714", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-beychevelle-2016/153336"},

Il Marroneto's 2015 Brunello di Montalcino opens to a light garnet color with faint ruby highlights.

Fruit is harvested from a five-hectare parcel at 300 meters above sea level with calcareous sand and Galestro soils. These conditions lead to the aromatic intensity of the wine, and that's the main takeaway in this classic vintage. There is a moment of softness that expands quickly over the palate.

This wine was bottled in June 2019, and it hit the market in January 2020.\r\n 96+ There is an inherent sweetness to this red, courtesy of the ripe strawberry and cherry fruit, complemented by mineral, tobacco and wild herb notes, balanced by a backbone of dense, refined tannins. Shows fine balance and length. Best from 2023 through 2040. Il Marroneto sits just north of the town of Montalcino. Owner Alessandro Mori explains that the soil here is predominantly marine sand with micro-minerals from the coast, giving a floral rather than fruity expression. He uses botti (large oak casks) only for ageing, with some dating back to the 1970s - though it must be said that the cellar here is fanatically clean. The 2015 rings through with purity and clarity and is indeed decidedly mineral and floral-driven. Sweet earth, dried violets and lavender complement an underlying core of cherry and raspberry. The palate is tangy and saline with lots of substance, flavor and depth. Wonderfully textured with grainy tannins that escalate across the palate. Drinking Window 2020 - 2032 Il Marroneto's 2015 Brunello di Montalcino presents one of the prettiest expressions of fresh, ripe strawberries that I can recall, complemented by hints of subtle sweet spice, leather, and cedar dust, while also gaining further depth the longer it sits in the glass. On the palate, soft textures are offset by zesty red fruits and hints of Tuscan spice-box, with red florals punctuate the experience. The finish leans more to the savory side. A twang of brisk acids tugs at the senses, hints of fine tannin settle in, and sweet spices linger long. The balance here is remarkable in this wonderfully pure and pretty expression of Sangiovese.

The Cabernet Sauvignon seduces with a firm structure, delivering aromas of red fruits, with velvety, somewhat tense tannins, which dance on the palate. At the same time, the Merlot grants a silky sensation, while the Cabernet Franc offers a unique elegance and minerality, inviting the Carmenere to fill the middle mouth with its black fruits, such as blackberries and plums, creating an attractive and enveloping volume. Likewise, inspiring aromas of fresh spices, together with a balanced acidity, create a nervous wine with an unforgettable and long finish. In turn, the Syrah offers friendly blue notes that evoke flowers such as lavender and violet, complemented with notes of dried fruits and a touch of moka from the French barrels that sheltered this wine for more than 20 wise months.

The grapes were harvested at night and had a five-day cold soak before fermenting with indigenous yeasts. Malolactic was in barrel, and the \u00e9levage lasted 20 months. I was surprised because the initial sensation was of a Syrah, and the wine only has a very small percentage of the grape; the smoky and meaty notes must come from other grapes, not from the Syrah. As the wine sat in the glass and got warmer, it turned spicier. It's juicy and has the oak nicely folded into the fruit. To me, it has the lightness and the expression of Cachapoal, in a style that's easy to drink and quite versatile for the table. 96,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in August 2018. Berry, raisin and vanilla aromas open this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Carmen\u00e8re, Syrah and Cabernet Franc. On the palate, this is thick and dense, with grabby tannins. Herbal berry and cassis flavors finish with notes of green herbs common to many 2016 Chilean reds. Drink through 2025.

The nose is expressive and delicate, offering a wonderfully aromatic range of summer berries, black cherries and blueberries, very lightly underpinned by a toasted spiciness. The attack is mellow and the palate, like the nose, is precise and refined. Well-integrated woodiness and delicate, velvety tannins carried by ripe and generous fruit. The finish is juicy and precise. There is overall opulence and denseness from start to finish. This wine is harmonious, with an impressive balance between the fruit and the delicate tannins.", "reviews": "This is one of the great successes of this vintage. It is generous and rich while also solid and structured. The combination of the essence of black currant and the elegant tannic structure are superb. This is a wine for serious aging and the wine should not be broached before 2026.  Cellar Selection Reminding me of the 1990, the 2015 Ch\u00e2teau Pichon Baron is a sensational bottle of wine made from 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot that spent 18 months in 80% new French oak. Boasting a deep purple color as well as awesome notes of black raspberries, toasted spices, cassis, lead pencil shavings, tobacco leaf and building minerality, this full-bodied, concentrated 2015 has sweet tannin, a great texture, and a big, big finish. Pauillac all the way, with both opulence and finesse, forget bottles of 4-5 years and enjoy anytime over the following two to three decades. This is a match for the 2009, 2000, and 1990. Medium to deep garnet-purple in color, the 2015 Pichon-Longueville Baron is enticingly scented of chocolate-covered cherries, crushed red currants and mulberries with touches of baking spices, potpourri and bay leaves plus a hint of fallen leaves. Sumptuously elegant, refreshing and medium-bodied with gorgeous, expressive, perfumed red fruits and very fine, very firm tannins, it has a persistent, perfumed finish. Its remarkable intensity, freshness and very firm frame suggest a long-lived Pichon Baron, which should cellar gracefully for 30+ years. A masterful wine, the 2015 Ch\u00e2teau Pichon Baron navigates nicely through elegance and power. The wine's fresh red currants deftly lead into nuances of black fruits and bright minerality. On the palate, there is a firmness that makes it superbly satisfying. This wine will go down as one of the ch\u00e2teau's best wines ever. (Tasted: January 25, 2018, San Francisco, CA) This is a muscular edition with attractive, deeply ripe blackberries and plums set amid firm and assertively linear tannins that hold the finish long and on point. Cool-fruited finish. There\u2019s great potential here. Try this from 2023. A fresh and focused style, with a terrific beam of black cherry and black currant compote flavors. Strong graphite and black tea notes harness the finish, ending with alder and tobacco echoes. This has serious length without losing any drive along the way. Best from 2022 through 2038. Brimming with confidence, it\u2019s not as obviously delectable right now as the second wine Les Griffons, but that is as you would expect at this stage, and in fact underlines the excellent construction and potential of the first wine. It is fairly reserved, yet the layers of black fruits and tannins are all in place. 80% new oak. Sensationally rich though it may be, this spellbinding wine earns\r\nits third star by way of its impeccable crafting and polish. It is full\r\nand wonderfully fleshy in feel, but its potency comes with a sense\r\nof unexpected grace and it conveys confidence without need of\r\nswagger. Evocative of cassis, berries and optimally ripe plums,\r\nbut not stopping with fruit and showing a penetrating streak of\r\nstony, graphite-like minerality along with touches of black tea\r\nand a smattering of exotic spice, it is at once fairly accessible yet\r\nhas the structure to warn against overly hasty drinking. It will\r\nlikely test the resolve of claret collectors who are short on patience,\r\nbut six to ten years of patience is very much in order if the wine is\r\nto reach its considerable best.", "rating": "96.125", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-pichon-longueville-baron-2015/153355"},

{"name": "Chateau Canon 2016", "origin": "St. Emilion, Bordeaux, France", "price": 199.99, "abv": "14", "description": "Blend: 74% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc", "reviews": "This wine is impressive both from its structure and its fruit, one of the stars of the vintage in Saint\u00c9milion. It has great weight, concentration as well as style and aging potential. The ripe fruit shines through the structure, promising an elegant maturity. Drink from 2025. \r\n Editors' Choice Composed of 74% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc and aged for 18 months in 70% new French barriques, the 2016 Canon is medium to deep garnet-purple in color, and\u2014WOW\u2014it opens with the most stunning perfume of violets, red roses and kirsch, giving way to a core of black cherry preserves, chocolate box, licorice, warm plums and Chinese five spice plus an earthy waft of underbrush. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is completely filled with expressive, perfumed black berry layers accented by lively red fruits and exotic spices, supported by impressively fine-grained tannins and fantastic tension, finishing very long with jaw-dropping energy. Tasted three times, I had one opportunity to taste the 2015 and 2016 Canon side by side. While I love the bold, rich, seductive nature of the 2015, this 2016 kicks it up a notch in terms of polish, precision, depth and persistence. Most notably, the superbly ripe, exquisitely fine-grained tannins on this 2016 bring to the table a whole other level of sophistication. Bravo!\r\n\r\n Rating: 98+ Complex aromas of blackberries, iodine, oyster shell and wet earth. Ever so perfumed. Full-bodied, yet reserved and tight with very silky tannins that are energized and minerally. Takes off at the end. The freshness lifts it. Try after 2024. This has all the power that St-Emilion can deliver, but deals it out slowly with precision, gorgeous balance and a clean lift. It has great concentration, purity and depth, without sacrificing the integrity of the juicy blueberry and cassis fruits. It really is a great example of what the limestone plateau can do. The 2015 delivers a slightly more voluptuous edge to the fruits, whereas this vintage emphasises fresh mint leaf, salinity and grip. A wonderful wine, utterly delicious. The 2016 Ch\u00e2teau Canon is another beautiful wine from this estate, made in a more streamlined, elegant style compared to the richer, sexier 2015. Checking in as a blend of 74% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc all from a magical terroir situated on the upper plateau just outside of the village of Saint-Emilion, it saw a small percentage of the blend go through malolactic fermentation in barrel, and the wine spent 18 months in 70% new French oak, with the balance in once-used. Gorgeous notes of blueberries, cassis, spring flowers, white truffle, and crushed rock nuances all come soaring from the glass and it has notable intensity as well as complexity. Medium to full-bodied, with vibrant acidity, ultra-fine tannins, and a straight, silky texture, I don\u2019t think it matches the 2015 on concentration, but it\u2019s perfectly balanced and has a texture to die for. It needs a good 4-5 years of bottle age (or more) and it\u2019s going to be long-lived. Tasted three times. This delivers a pretty serious ball of fruit, with a mix of raspberry, blueberry and black currant flavors providing range, while sweet tobacco notes and chalky minerality impart texture and detail. There's a fresh savory echo on the finish. Much less reliant on toast than most of its peers. Best from 2022 through 2037. 6,667 cases made. Very generously appointed with ripe, black cherry fruit and decked\r\nout with a broad sweep of sweet spice in both scent and taste\r\nand showing lovely continuity and fine concentration, Ch\u00e2teau\r\nCanon is a serious, far-reaching St.-Emilion wine that compels\r\ncontemplation and seems to reveal a little more interest with\r\neach sniff and sip. It is not an immense wine, but it is one of\r\ngreat strength and real beauty that is guaranteed to pay even\r\ngreater dividends when laid away and allowed to develop for six\r\nto ten years.", "rating": "96.14285714285714", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-canon-2016/202263"},

There is a seductively wild side to the wine that comes forth with chiseled intensity. Dark fruit, spice, tar, licorice and toasted spice make for a beautifully elegant bouquet. The mouthfeel remains mid-weight in approach, with polished tannins and a tightly knit texture that should relax and grow in volume as the wine evolves in the bottle.

Roederer's winemaking style is based on two elements: ownership of its own vineyards and the addition of oak-aged reserve wines to each year's blend or cuvee. All the grapes for the Anderson Valley wines are grown on the Estate. Each year, the winemaker selects a portion of the best wines for aging in Center of France oak casks. Aged from one to three years, wines from this reserve cellar are added to the blend, creating a multi-vintage cuvee in the traditional Roederer style, known for its body, finesse and depth of flavor.

Its wonderful play of creamy yet kinetic textures, the custardy, limey flavours, and its impeccable focus all add up to one of the best ways possible to greet 6pm after a long work day.

{"name": "Chateau Leoville Las Cases 2016", "origin": "St-Julien, Bordeaux, France", "price": 309.99, "abv": "13.5", "description": "Blend: 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Franc", "reviews": "Very deep purple-black colored, the 2016 L\u00e9oville Las Cases (composed of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Franc) is quite closed to begin, yet with patient coaxing it unfurls beautifully to reveal suggestions of ripe blackcurrants, black raspberries, warm redcurrants and wild blueberries, followed by touches of unsmoked cigars, tilled red soil, cast iron pan, fallen leaves and lavender plus wonderfully fragrant wafts of lilacs and baking spices. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is packed with tightly knit, very subtle layers of minerals, floral notions and black and red berries, all framed by exquisitely ripe, silt-like tannins and fantastic freshness, finishing with epic length and depth. Simply captivating even in its youth, give it at least a decade in the cellar and then enjoy it over the next 50+ years. Very complex and alluringly spicy aromas that bubble in and out of the nose, together with fresh tobacco, raspberries and iodine, moving into blackcurrants, blackberries and a gently gravely, stony edge. The palate has incredible polish that is a foil for the intense power and concentration of this wine. The texture is flawless, building smoothly with fine-grained and focused tannins that sustain a long, fresh finish. The new 1986, which was a legend. This is probably better. A blend of 75 per cent cabernet sauvignon, 14 per cent merlot and 11 per cent cabernet franc. Try from 2024. Nothing under 20 years old supplies fruit for the grand vin de L\u00e9oville. It's extremely dark and rich, a stately purple in colour with some violet around the rim. Right from the off it expands upwards and outwards, showing polished dark, dark fruits such as black cherry and cassis, alongside slate, liquorice and rosemary. It's mouthfilling and almost less austere than all of the others, yet it's a serious wine. The tannins close in on themselves at the end, showing how this is built to last. A great advert for the whole of Bordeaux, and for me it's the clear wine of the vintage. The 2016 L\u00e9oville Las Cases is the finest vintage I\u2019ve ever tasted from this estate; in fact, in this reviewer\u2019s opinion, this magical, perfect wine couldn\u2019t be better. Made from 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Franc aged 22 months in 90% new oak, it reveals a deep, saturated purple color as well as a thrilling bouquet of cr\u00e8me de cassis, iris flowers, graphite, crushed rocks, and freshly sharpened lead pencils. A perfect example of the old saying \u201can iron fist in a velvet glove,\u201d it hits the palate with full-bodied richness, a deep, layered, stacked mid-palate, flawless integration of its acidity and tannins, and a monster finish. The balance and purity here are off the charts. Hide bottles for a decade or so and enjoy over the following half a century. This is really dense, yet remarkably polished and poised, delivering wave after wave of blueberry, a\u00e7a\u00ed berry,\r\nraspberry and blackberry puree notes, all while warm tar and sweet tobacco details cruise underneath. There\u2019s a\r\nlong, smoldering cast iron note through the finish that adds both austerity and authority in a truly unique manner.\r\nBest from 2025 through 2045. Dominated by the great Cabernet Sauvignon vines of the clos of L\u00e9oville las Cases, this wine is superbly rich and smoky while being stylish. Its power comes from the complexity, ripe fruits and dense tannins.This wine has enormous potential.

The palate has a svelte and elegant shape. Smoother than the 2002, it shares the same quality of precision but not the raging power of that vintage. The poise is unquestionable, the wine very reserved, with plenty of lemon-infused citrus flavors, hints of fresh cashew and a lot of potential. Acidity holds superbly, the dosage is exactly where it should be. This is a classic release. It's all about chardonnay. Best from 2022 and will mature gracefully in linear style in bottle for several decades. This is the current and latest vintage release from Krug, and is a fitting successor to 2002, though it's very different in style - unusually, the blend contains more Chardonnay than Pinot Noir. Despite this, it is hallmark Krug with its oxidative profile. It has a luminous freshness and good density without heaviness. There\u2019s a controlled power to this poised, vinous, linear 2004, displaying candied fruits, minerals, gingerbread, white chocolate, caramel and marzipan. This has a long, dry autolytic finish, great balance and lovely bead.

Dense and round, with a delicate mineral soul, the pure but perfectly balanced 2004 reveals great finesse and weightless elegance with a long and round finish. This is a gorgeous Krug vintage that is 14 years old but still on the rise. Tasted from ID 316034 in New York in November 2018. Precision sets this wine apart, as if the flavors had diamond-cut clarity. Whatever cool earthiness or spicy-lees broadness there may be is focused and lifted by the structure, so that the wine\u2019s flavors feel restrained and elegant. Deliciously fresh, with an undercurrent of chalky tension and a citrus sting, this would be a great partner to Cantonese dim sum.", "rating": "96.25", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/krug-vintage-brut-2004/343398"},

There is an evident sense of fruit ripeness here that helps to build momentum and staying power. Clay soils in the vineyard site have also helped to contribute to the heft and full-bodied nature of this special wine.

{"name": "Chateau Pontet-Canet (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2016", "origin": "Pauillac, Bordeaux, France", "price": 339.97, "abv": "13.5", "description": "Blend: 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot", "reviews": "A voluptuous wine, this is rich and fruity yet properly balanced by a magnificent structure. Pure, crisp and packed with a black currant flavor, this will be a remarkable wine as it develops. Still young, it needs many years to develop. Don\u2019t think about drinking before 2025.\r\n Editors' Choice The 2016 Pontet-Canet is absolutely breathtaking. Powerful, ample and racy in the glass, the 2016 is one of the most exquisitely well-balanced young Pontet-Canets I can remember tasting. Savory, high-toned aromatics and brisk mineral notes lend energy and delineation as this vivid wonderfully alive wine opens up in the glass. The flavors are dark and incisive, but it is the wine's total sense of harmony that is most compelling. All of the elements are simply in the right place. The 2016 is tremendous. It's as simple as that. As is often the case, Pontet-Canet is one of the most singular wines in Bordeaux. Alfred Tesseron could have chosen to play things safe when he took over the management of the estate in the mid-1990s. Instead, he chose a very different path. No proprietor in Bordeaux has taken more risks over the last two decades than Alfred Tesseron. A commitment to biodynamic farming, sustainability across the entire estate more broadly, and the adoption of new concepts for Bordeaux, such as aging a portion of the wine in terra cotta, set Pontet-Canet apart from other properties in Pauillac and the Left Bank. Not surprisingly, the wine is also starkly different from the wines of neighboring estates. The blend of the 2016 Pontet-Canet is 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. Around 55% of the wine was aged in new French oak barrels, 15% in two-year-old barrels and 35% in cement amphorae for 16 months. Deep garnet-purple colored, it opens with opulent scents of plum preserves, spice cake, hoisin and cr\u00e8me de cassis with fragrant wafts of potpourri, wood smoke and rose hip tea. Medium to full-bodied, rich and decadent, with loads of spicy layers, it has a firm, velvety texture with great freshness and incredible depth, finishing very long and on a compelling mineral note. The 2016 is a vintage that shows off the best of Pontet, and is similar in feel to their 2010. Gorgeously rich right from the first nose, it opens stunningly in the glass, showing waves of tight black fruits, touches of redcurrant, liquorice and aniseed, fine tannins and mouthwatering salinity. It manages to remain balanced without losing the punch and concentration of Pauillac, rising up through the palate. It's hard not to fall in love with this wine, and it will clearly age with grace and ease. Bottled in July 2018. Reminding me of the 2010 and, I suspect, a wine that will merit a triple-digit rating in a decade or so (I tasted this on multiple occasions and thought it was perfect on one of them), the 2016 Ch\u00e2teau Pontet-Canet comes from 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc, and the balance Petit Verdot that spent 16 months in 50% new French oak, 35% in concrete amphora, and the rest in second fill oak. Thrilling notes of pure cr\u00e8me de cassis, lead pencil shavings, crushed mint, graphite, and crushed rock notes all emerge from this deep, powerful, yet elegant Pauillac. The style of this wine has become more and more finesse-driven and pure, yet it hasn\u2019t lost a beat on concentration or length. This singular, beautiful Pontet-Canet needs 7-8 years of cellaring (it has some accessibility today given its purity and balance) and will keep for 4-5 decades.\r\n\r\n Rating: 98+ The aromas of ripe blackcurrants, iodine, sweet tobacco and fresh flowers are spellbinding. Full-bodied with mouth-expanding, massive and natural tannins. Impressive fruit with hints of prunes. The finish is long and powerful. Needs six to seven years to soften and come together This is sappy and rich in feel, with waves of red and black currant preserves, raspberry and bitter plum coulis. The long finish drips with sweet tobacco and anise notes, while a brambly layer courses underneath. The vivacious finish kicks into second gear as the fruit and grip come together.

The wine is based on the dark red fruit, earth, spice and mid-palate richness of Mourv\u00e8dre, with additions of Grenache for forward fruit, approachability and lushness, Syrah for mineral, aromatics, and back-palate tannins, and Counoise for brambly spice and acidity.", "reviews": "Combines structure with polish and substance, offering expressive raspberry, garrigue and smoked spice flavors that build richness toward refined tannins. Mourv\u00e8dre, Grenache, Syrah and Counoise. Drink now through 2025. Robert Haas, founder of the wine-importing firm Vineyard Brands, established Tablas Creek in partnership with the Perrin family of Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape in 1989. They planted a vineyard in western Paso Robles with cuttings from Ch\u00e2teau de Beaucastel, the Perrin\u2019s Ch\u00e2teauneuf property. Those vines, farmed organically by Robert\u2019s son, Jason, and winegrower Neil Collins, have produced some of California\u2019s most elegant and evocative Rh\u00f4ne-variety wines, like this blend of mourvedre (46 percent), syrah, grenache and counoise. It has a rooty spice, like turmeric and ginger, and a gentle clarity to its pomegranate-bright fruit. Patrick J. Comiskey, an editor at W&S and the author of American Rh\u00f4ne, described the flavors as substantial but lifted: \u201cIt\u2019s airy, in a positive sense. Vivid ruby-red. A highly perfumed bouquet evokes ripe black raspberry and cherry preserves, incense, baking spices and smoky minerals. Sweet, seamless and energetic on the palate, showing impressive depth as well as energy and sharp delineation to the intense red and dark berry, spicecake and violet pastille flavors. Finishes smooth, sappy and impressively long, with repeating florality and fine-grained tannins that add framework and subtle closing grip. Violets, rose petals, fresh blueberries, crushed stones, oyster shell and dried spices. Full-bodied with a tangy core of berry fruit, firm and structured tannins and a spicy finish. Drink in 2020. Just bottled last week, the 2016 Esprit de Tablas is an age-worthy blend of 46% Mourv\u00e8dre, 31% Syrah, 18% Grenache, and the rest Counoise that was brought up all in foudre. It offers perfumed notes of raspberries, cherries, leafy herbs, and hints of violets. With medium to full body, a seamless texture, and beautiful purity of fruit, it has a forward, fresh, accessible style yet will benefit from 2-3 years of bottle age and cruise for a decade after that. The 2016 Esprit de Tablas is a blend of 46% Mourv\u00e8dre, 31% Syrah, 18% Grenache and 5% Counoise\u2014winemaker Neil Collins says there's more Grenache than usual in the blend this vintage. Pale to medium ruby, it has a pretty nose of desiccated roses, fresh blueberries, black and red cherries, loamy earth, sage brush, tobacco leaves and charcuterie.

But the palate reveals a fresh vintage, following the style I saw in the other ros\u00e9 and the white. It has good acidity that is nicely folded into the fruit, along with very clean and subtle flavors, and it's serious and austere but dry and not banal. I managed to taste a bottle at the last minute, and the nose showed much better, with faint floral notes, quite elegant. I showed it to my daughter, and she said it smelled of a posh lady! Some 22,000 bottles were produced in 2018. A yeasty note of cured ham is noted on this lightly oaked high-end Rioja ros\u00e9.

{"name": "Chateau Mouton Rothschild 2016", "origin": "Pauillac, Bordeaux, France", "price": 729.99, "abv": "14", "description": "The wine is a dark and intense cherry red. The highly refined nose reveals perfectly ripe fruit. Ripe bilberry and blackcurrant aromas combine harmoniously with floral notes. With airing, the nose unfolds on pepper and spice balanced by elegant notes of graphite and blonde tobacco, bringing charm and nobility to an extensive range of aromas. The full and dense attack exhibits exceptionally well-rounded and silky tannins. The ample mid-palate abounds in black fruit along with cocoa flavours and biscuity notes, leading into a full-bodied and remarkably persistent finish, the sign of a great vintage. Blend: 83% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 1% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot", "reviews": "Dark ruby, purple color. Aromas of blackcurrants, black truffle, crushed stone, licorice and hints of tar. Full-bodied, deep and vertical on the palate, drawing you in and down. The structure is very tannic and powerful, yet the tannins are folded into the wine. One of the most powerful Moutons ever for me. Try after 2027. A towering, thrilling wine, the 2016 Mouton Rothschild is unbelievably beautiful today. Aromatics, fruit density and vertical structure all come together. In the glass, the 2016 is remarkably vivid and powerful, and yet a gentler, more feminine side emerges with time in the glass. The intense, mineral, savory profile recalls the 1986, but the 2016 has more grace, inner sweetness and sophistication than that wine. Even so, the 2016 is going to need at least a number of years in bottle before it starts drinking well, although it won't be the bruiser the 1986 remains to this day. This is breathtaking wine from Mouton, Tecnical Director Philippe Dhalluin and his team. Composed of 83% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 1% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot, the 2016 Mouton Rothschild has an opaque garnet-purple color. WOW\u2014the nose explodes from the glass with powerful blackcurrant cordial, black raspberries, blueberry pie and melted chocolate notions, plus suggestions of aniseed, camphor, lifted kirsch and the faintest waft of a subtle floral perfume in the background. Full-bodied, concentrated, bold and totally seductive in the mouth, it has very fine-grained, silt-like tannins, while jam-packed with tightly wound fruit layers, finishing in this wonderful array of mineral sparks. Magic. Along with the Ch\u00e2teau Lafite, the 2016 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild is the wine of the vintage from the M\u00e9doc and is a truly profound, magical, blockbuster wine in every sense. It\u2019s based on 83% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, raised in new French oak. Boasting a saturated purple color as well as an extraordinary bouquet of thick black fruits, lead pencil shavings, new saddle leather, and burning embers, with just a hint of its oak upbringing, this beauty hits the palate with a mammoth amount of fruit and texture yet stays fresh, pure, and light on its feet, with a thrilling sense of minerality as well as building tannins on the finish. It\u2019s one of the most profound young wines I\u2019ve ever tasted, and while it will probably keep for three-quarters of a decade, it offers pleasure even today. Bravo! A higher level of acidity than is usual for Mouton is buttressed by waves of fruit and tannin. It's a modern take on 1986 that shows the most wonderful precision of creme caramel, liquorice, blackcurrant, creme de cassis and cedar. it's opulent but also has great tension through the palate - a monumental Mouton that for me has gained in stature over the past two years of ageing. The idea of a drinking window almost feels like a mirage - the perfect moment is likely to recede into the distance time and time again. It could be drunk in the next decade perhaps, but it's going to take 20 years or more to really get into its stride. Easily one of the wines of the vintage, for me this is showing even better than during en primeur. 1% Cabernet Franc completes the blend. The rich fruit in this wine nearly envelops the tannins. Flavors of black plums, blackberries and blueberries meld with intense acidity to mask the power and concentration of the polished tannins. With this structure, will age for many, many years. Do not drink before 2026. \r\n Cellar Selection A generous, pure and lush ball of Cabernet, with wave after wave of unadulterated cassis and blackberry puree\r\nflavors rolling through. Features notes of roasted apple wood and sweet tobacco, offset by a long tug of sweet\r\nearth, but that\u2019s all background music to the impressive core of fruit, which steams along like a cruise ship with\r\nenough stores in reserve to go around the world twice without stopping.

The nose reveals the aroma of white pepper and figs, with perfectly integrated blueberry notes. Aging in oak barrels from the Tonnellerie des Domaines in Pauillac adds subtle notes of nutmeg to the wine. This vintage shows exceptional complexity. The fruit is bright and luminous, supported by well-integrated oak and refreshing acidity. The tannins are soft and silky and contribute to the wine\u2019s persistence. This wine will reveal its complexity with further bottle aging. Blend: 83% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Malbec", "reviews": "2016 might have reminded visiting Bordelais of a particularly wet harvest back home, but the best wines from the vintage are refreshing, balanced and wonderfully \u201cEuropean\u201d in style. Combining Cabernet Sauvignon with 17% Malbec, this is a stunning blend showing elegance, poise and finesse. Racy and nuanced, with graphite, cedarwood and polished tannins. Already quite open, this is a cool and slightly shy wine with ripe plum, delicate herb and toasty aromas. The rather sleek palate and fresh acidity carry the long, clean, rather stony finish. For the first time, this is dominated by 90 per cent cabernet sauvignon. Drink or hold. The cedary nose of the 2016 Caro transported me to the wines from Bordeaux, and the explanation might be because the blend is 83% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest Malbec\u2014the highest percentage of Cabernet in the history of Caro. This has very good complexity; it feels young (Cabernet tends to develop at a slower pace than Malbec), even though it matured in 100% new oak the oak is very integrated. The barriques are only produced by the Lafite barrel makers, and there is great care in the selection of the wood and the toast; the barrels are designed to produce a more elegant style of wine, subtle and harmonious, with a notable absence of toasted and smoky aromas. This wine is polished and sleek, but there is nice balance to develop nicely in bottle for a good decade. 50,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in December 2017. COMMENTARY: Whenever a collaboration takes place between two countries and two cultures, the results require time to access. The CARO from Mendoza\u2014a synergy between France and Argentina\u2014was quick to show its pedigree. The 2016 vintage is proof positive that this marriage worked well. TASTING NOTES: This wine is attractive, and stylish that shows an excellent blending of the Old and New Worlds. Its aromas and flavors of red and black currants, generosity on the palate, and a smooth aftertaste should pair it perfectly with grilled beef ribs.

Full-bodied and laden with taut, muscular black fruit and loads of mineral accents, it has a firm structure of super ripe, finely grained tannins and amazing freshness, finishing very long and very layered.  Barrel Sample:  96-98 Always one of my favourites in the Perse stable, this is once again delicious. Chewy tannins are joined by ripples of coffee and soft brambly fruits, subtly shifting gear as it moves through the palate. The average age of the vines here is 51 years old, which helps to give depth of flavour. There's a sense of straining against the barricades here, with the fruit being firmly held in check by the tannins. It's not going anywhere soon.\u00a0Drinking Window\u00a02026\u00a0-\u00a02040.

The palate is medium-bodied with fine, supple tannin. There is a little more acidity here that imparts more tension, while it has the same salinity as the Flood on the finish. This is an excellent and quite sophisticated Pinot Noir that is my pick from Chapter 24's three contributions to the 2014 vintage.

The palate is perfect with a full body, but has perfectly integrated tannins with a texture like the finest cashmere. It's strong but noble with perfect form and beauty. All in harmony. A fabulous wine that everyone who loves Bordeaux should have a bottle or case of. Better in 2020. While I loved the 2010 Ch\u00e2teau Ducru-Beaucaillou on release I\u2019ve always preferred the 2009. However, the 2010 showed sensationally on this occasion, and while in a different style than the 2009, it\u2019s unquestionably as good. Still ruby/purple-hued, it offers up extraordinary notes of pure cr\u00e8me de cassis, unsmoked tobacco, spice, and damp earth, and it\u2019s the purity of fruit as well as the incredible depth and intensity that makes this wine so special. Full-bodied, deep, profound, and seamless on the palate, it offers incredible pleasure today but it\u2019s going to be a 50-year, if not a 100-year wine. Hats off to Bruno Borie. Deep garnet colored, the 2010 Ducru-Beaucaillou bursts from the glass with bold, expressive blackcurrant cordial, baked plums and mulberries scents plus wafts of menthol, Marmite toast, black olives and dried lavender. Full-bodied, the palate is built like a brick house, with solid walls of super firm, super ripe tannins and bold freshness supporting the muscular black fruits, finishing with great length. Rating: 98+ There is tannin build up at this point in the vertical, but in the most enjoyable way - a clear indication of how much complexity there is in these wines and how densely knitted together they are, bedding down for the long term. This wine in particular has barely an end in sight, it just stretches out before you, confident in its fleshy texture and layers of expression. This is really at the top of what you hope from St Julien, confident and intense yet still with the balance and freshness of the appellation. It has great persistency and keeps hanging on, delivering flavour an inch at a time. Wonderful. Not shy at all, with a flamboyant, aromatic profile of roasted apple wood and warm ganache, featuring more than enough stuffing in the form of thickly layered blackberry paste, steeped fig and pastis-soaked plum flavors. The structure is massive but incredibly polished, and the fruit displays terrific purity through the graphite-supported finish. Large-scale and extremely well-rendered. Best from 2020 through 2040. A grand wine, it has great ripeness and richness, majestic in its structure and upright character. It is concentrated, perfumed and opulent. The style of Ducru Beaucaillou is both generous and powerful, and obviously ageworthy.

On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, broad and vinous, with a fleshy profile that's enlivened by delicate phenolics. Fresh, precise and integrated, this is showing very well.

My notes on this incredible wine are laced with expletives that I, unfortunately, can\u2019t repeat here. Safe to say, however, it\u2019s one of the greatest young Bordeaux I\u2019ve been lucky enough to taste.

Pure magic on the palate as well, with full-bodied richness, building structure, and a seamless, weightless, yet powerful mouthfeel, it has everything you could want from a wine. It has the purity and balance to drink well in 7-8 years (I wouldn\u2019t hold it against you if couldn\u2019t wait that long) and will keep for 50 years or more. For the tech geeks out there, this hit 14.49% alcohol.  Barrel Sample : 98-100 2018 is another vintage where it's pretty much impossible to find fault with Las Cases, and where you get a kick of happiness from tasting it. Owner Jean-Hubert Delon compares the 2016 to the 1961 and the 2018 to the 1959 - let's all check back in a few decades to see if that's true!\r\n \r\nBut where the 2016 was monumental, this has a subtlety that's rarely seen in such a young LLC. It's not that you'd call this approachable but you rarely see this level of plush density to the fruit at this stage. There's a civilised quality to the structure that makes you think, just maybe, the 2018 will be at optimum drinking before the 2016. You're still getting the complex cigar box and cassis aromatics, with deep, rippling black fruits on the palate accompanied by a cassis and liquorice whoosh and the layering up of dense but fine tannins. It demonstrates precise balance and an exceptionally long finish. All in all, this is a standout St-Julien.\r\n \r\nThis year sees the lowest percentage of press wine ever used at this estate, coming in at under 3% (it's normally double this), because the wine already had so much structure that the normal level of press wine threw it out of balance. I'm pretty sure that I've never given a drinking window this early for LLC at En Primeur, which says something. 90% new oak. \r\n  Barrel Sample:  98 It is the tannins that mark out this powerful wine, presenting a fine balancing act between a firm structure and rich dark fruit flavors.

Disgorged in October 2018, the 2012 Brut Vintage offers up aromas of smoky peach, apples, pastry cream, white flowers and mandarin. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, broad and powerful, with more volume and amplitude than its blanc de blancs counterpart, revealing racy balancing acids, an already refined mousse and the impressive concentration that typifies this low-yielding vintage. It's a classic blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay that saw seven grams per liter dosage. Rating: 94+ Harmonious and straight with clarity and beauty to the wine.

This was the best example of the 2005 that I have tasted, perhaps a wine that is going to prove that, the longer wine lovers can resist temptation. It is a blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 3.5% Cabernet Franc and .5% Petit Verdot picked between 23 September and 9 October. The bouquet is extremely detailed, displaying more red berry fruit compared to the 2010 Montrose that leans towards black. Graphite and cedar emerge with time, even an unusual floral scent that is uncommon with respect to this property, whilst all the time retaining fantastic focus and delineation. The palate is medium-bodied with a ferrous tincture on the entry. There are the first signs of secondary notes (dried leaves and bay leaf), but it is the tannic backbone and the precision that really defines this Montrose at the moment. For certain, it is masculine and structured, yet it has enormous potential, perhaps more than was suggested when it was first released? This is for the long term, but you know that already. Tasted June 2016. This continues to be very tight yet I loved drinking it the other night at dinner. Loads of spices, berries, meat, cloves and chocolate on the nose. Full body with soft, silky tannins and lots of rich fruit. Still chewy. This is just starting to open up now. Drink or hold. The 2005 from Montrose is straight up sensational, and while young, it offers loads of pleasure today. Cassis, tobacco leaf, damp earth, graphite, and cedar characteristics flow to a full-bodied, thrilling concentrated 2005 that has ultra-fine tannin and a blockbuster finish. Its purity of fruit is off the charts, and while it\u2019s just now starting to turn the corner and enter it plateau of drinkability, it\u2019s going to keep for another 3-4 decades. Black licorice and blackberry aromas, with hints of mineral, lead to a full-bodied palate. Very chewy, with loads of tannins, yet this follows through with beautifully ripe fruit, mineral and mint. Fascinating. Best after 2012. This is so big it is blinding, a storm of mineral tannin and plum-skin extract. The volume is turned up high, and even as the tannic noise factor begins to diminish with days of air, the wine is still closed tight. The comportment of its power shows this to be a wine from a great terroir; the property, in fact, has some parallels to Latour, with its similarly shaped gravel promontory above the Gironde. Montrose consistently grows one of the staunchest, long-lived wines of the M\u00e9doc and though accommodations have been made in recent years to soften it, the tannic index in February 2006 read at 82, a force to reckon with over the decades to come.", "rating": "95.2", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-montrose-2005/96219"},

Aromas of ripe dark-skinned berry, violet, underbrush and warm spice emerge in the glass, along with a whiff of camphor.

Editor's Choice Current winemaker, Filippo Manni arrived at CastelGiocondo at the beginning of 2015. He brings precision to the winemaking, vinifying each of the estate's plots separately then making a selection of these to determine the final blend.

Hats off to proprietor Bruno Borie for another magical wine. While the dense and dark tannins are prominent, they can\u2019t mask the exuberant fruit that wants to burst out. Blackberry flavors are impressively ripe and rich, shot through with acidity that gives the wine salinity as well as freshness. At the back, those tannins will allow the wine to age over many years. Don\u2019t drink before 2024. Deep ruby in colour, the tannins are confident and there is a good building of layers and power despite the still-evident austerity. As it opens up, you get cigar box, vanilla bean, liquorice, black chocolate and layers of gourmet flavours after a carafe (we tried it with and without). No need to worry too much about that, as you're not going to want to be drinking this yet but it gives a good indication of the fact that this is going to progress well and steadily, and is an excellent example of the vintage.

Rating: 96+ A suave and seductive wine, with a beautifully caressing mouthfeel to the layers of warmed plum, steeped boysenberry and blackberry compote flavors.

Alcohol:  14% The top of the range for Pinot Noir is the 2014 Ocio Pinot Noir, which is sourced from the oldest plants of the variety in the Casablanca Valley that were planted in 1980. Eighty-five percent of the grapes come from the Fundo El Tri\u00e1ngulo, 75 kilometers north of Santiago and 20 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean on granite, red clay and sand soils.

This straight-up phenomenal Cabernet offers a powerful nose of ripe black fruits, tobacco leaf, chocolate, and spring flowers, and it has a Margaux-like complexity and elegance. Full-bodied on the palate, it has a multi-dimensional, seamless texture, building tannins, and a great, great finish. It\u2019s a baby of a wine that needs 4-5 years of bottle age, but it will probably merit a triple-digit score in 7-8 years and keep for three decades.

Perhaps the only hint could be that the fruit from riper vintages takes the oak in a different way and curiously enough the 2012 shows more oak influence than the 2013. There is a great combination of floral and fresh characters and the Mediterranean profile with some aromas of dried herbs. The palate reveals a serious wine with grainy tannins that add an elegant rusticity. Again, the only problem here is having the 2013 next to this great 2012.

We selected the best from our plots in Virefougasse to blend a wine of complex aromas, with roundness on the palate and an extra-long finish with delicate notes of citrus and white flowers. The 2017 vintage is distinctive for its opulence and a very generous fatness that recall the finest Pavillon Blanc vintages.", "reviews": "This is a wonderful Pavillon Blanc with great aromatics and powerful flavours that highlight how those cool summer nights have given real zip and freshness without losing intensity. Intense and concentrated flavours of quince, fleshy tropical fruits, nectarines and white peaches are combined with a mouthwatering tension that holds your interest and delivers a stunningly slatey, mineral finish. Margaux didn't lose anything to frost, so had a 22hl/ha yield after careful selection (a normal amount for the estate).

Its concentrated and focused aromas and flavors of green apple and mineral go beyond those descriptors.

Rich, medium-bodied, ultra-fresh yet with terrific fruit, it can be drunk today or cellared for 10-15 years. Chateau Margaux has a spraying system to combat frost at this vineyard. Still, yields were down to 22 hectoliters per hectare due to some crop losses. As always, the 2017 Pavillon Blanc du Chateau Margaux is made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc.

Medium-bodied, the palate absolutely sings of vibrant citrus fruits and mineral accents, sporting a very lively line of freshness, finishing with great length and whispering of tons of aging potential. Stellar Pavillon Blanc! Readers should note that after 15 years of experimenting with Diam, this is the first year this wine will be bottled under this closure. To further aid aging with consistency, this is also the first year that the wine is in a dark green bottle as opposed to the former clear glass. Very lively, featuring a juicy, mouthfilling mix of peach, nectarine and tangerine notes, laced with a singed orange peel thread. Exotic yet pure flavors are married to electric energy.

On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, fleshy and vibrant, with an ample core of fruit complemented by abundant sapid nuances, bright acids and a fine but youthfully frothy mousse. This is an expressive rendition of Grand Si\u00e8cle that will drink well on release. Whereas the previous three Grand Si\u00e8cles included 2002 in the mix, and the three before that were bolstered by 1996, Iteration 24 has no \u2018superstar\u2019 component and therefore is a sublimation of the concept of a team effort, even if the 2007 represents 60% of the blend, with the '06 and '04 with 20% each. Disgorged in October 2018, the wine is precocious and somewhat undeveloped. Full-bodied and dense, it labours under its primary colours. With time, the wine will flourish and the famous Grand Si\u00e8cle freshness will rejuvenate the ensemble. Patience will assuredly be rewarded!

In the meanwhile, Fonseca looks like one of the greats of this vintage. Range:  96-98 Lots of ripe fruit here with raisins and wet earth that turn to violets and hot stones. Full-bodied, tannic and powerful with fantastic grip and intensity. Grabs you. Impressive. Drink in 2025. This bottling brings together a fine structure with great fruit to give a luscious wine that is also destined for long-term aging. With its ripe berry flavors sustained by some acidity, this is already balanced. Drink from 2028. Cellar Selection This leads in with bramble, spearmint and blueberry notes, with the energy\r\nextending through the core of dark plum, blackberry and fig fruit. The finish\r\nfeatures a strong graphite spine, allowing this to draw deep water, but this\r\nremains stylish in feel overall. Best from 2030 through 2055. Dark and mildly sweet with density and notes of vanilla and toast; racy, luscious, and long; superb now\u2014and built to last\u2014from a producer that released its first Port in 1840. Closed and withdrawn on the nose at this stage with an underlying dusting of ripe tannins evident. Firm, sweet cassis and berry fruit, with classic dark chocolate intensity at the core, backed by broad yet tight-knit peppery tannins which lead to a big, grippy finish.

{"name": "Bollinger Brut Special Cuvee (375ML half-bottle)", "origin": "Champagne, France", "price": 38.99, "abv": "12", "description": "The denomination Special Cuv\u00e9e was created in 1911. The idea came from William Folks, then partner of the illustrious London House of Mentzendorff. This great wine lover felt it was an insult to simply call this great wine \"non vintage\". The suggestion of naming it \"Special Cuv\u00e9e\" was immediately approved by Monsieur Bollinger. A blend par excellence, the Special Cuv\u00e9e is the purest expression of the Bollinger style; of its craftsmanship and its singular conception of what a champagne should be. It is, therefore, on this wine that the House of Bollinger shows how it is different from other Champagne Houses, asserts its qualitative policy and by which it asks to be judged.", "reviews": "There is always something extraordinary about the Bollinger Special Cuv\u00e9e Champagne Brut. I have savored the wines throughout my 40 years in my professional wine career, and the wine has always performed well. It begins with a refined mousse and entices with aromas of bread dough, ripe apples, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, as well as mineral accents. While it is full in its body and textures, its finish stays long, zesty, and memorable. Drinks well now, although today's bottle could use another half a dozen years in the cellar. (Tasted: September 26, 2016, San Francisco, CA) Lovely aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry and currant fruit, graphite, toast and candied Meyer lemon zest are set in this racy Champagne, with a refined, finely detailed mousse. The mouthwatering finish is long and spicy. Bollinger\u2019s NV Special Cuv\u00e9e knocks it out of the park. Made from 60% Pinot Noir, 25% Chardonnay and the rest Pinot Meunier, with 30% of the blend brought up in barrels, it boasts a rich, deep, medium to full-bodied style as well as terrific notes of lemon curd, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, caramelized stone fruits, and hints of toasty nuttiness that develop with time in the glass. It\u2019s a big, rich Champagne that stays balanced and pure. Beautiful stuff. As always with this producer, this iconic nonvintage cuv\u00e9e is dominated by Pinot Noir that gives impressive richness as well as ripe stone fruits. Wood fermentation adds further complexity as does the age of this bottling before release. Drink this Champagne now. Fine bubbles combine nicely with the cooked apples, pie crust and lemon rind. Some biscuit, too. Full body. Layered and creamy with a crisp finish. Always delicious. Drink now. Disgorged in the second half of 2019, the latest release of Bollinger's NV Brut Special Cuv\u00e9e is based on the 2015 vintage, complemented by around 60% reserve wines. The wine is still quite tightly wound after its recent disgorgement, opening in the glass with notes of crisp yellow orchard fruit, freshly baked bread, clear honey and orange peel, with little sign of the nuttiness to come with bottle age. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, muscular and incipiently textural, with a deep core, ripe acids and a pinpoint mousse. This isn't the most incisive vintage of Special Cuv\u00e9e, but it's powerful and vinous and will have fine gastronomic potential with a little bottle age.  Rating: 91+ Cool and generous, this is a bold, lusty Champagne with pinot-inspired scents of violets and flavors of dark berries, the wine structured by its time in oak. It\u2019s a vinous Brut, suited to roast fish and light game. 60% Pinot Noir; 25% Chardonnay; 15% Pinot Meunier. All Bolly in its toasty, chalky, slightly angular but powerful way, this wine reminds of the company's \"Grande Annee\" in its fairly bold approach. Frothy and insistent in its bubbles and tasty, rich, toasty, stony and vanillin all at the same time, this is Champagne with a purpose, and, in this case, it works without being over the top in any dimension.", "rating": "92.125", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/bollinger-brut-special-cuvee-375ml-half-bottle/18756"},

The hallmark seamlessness of Guigal\u2019s white wines is especially evident in this wine, which is unlike any Chateauneuf white we have experienced in its grace and lift. The beautifully balanced freshness and fleshiness, prominent floral and citrus notes, a complete wine. Guigal is today the single most important producer by value and volume of white wine in the Rhone, with 25% of their production dedicated to whites.

Its light gold color is followed by a rich, layered wine that has bright acidity as well as a straight, focused, classic style. Offering up notions of white peach, sliced apples, and subtle honeyed minerality, this concentrated, terrific white will keep for over a decade. The Saintes Pierres de Nalys white comes from all three of the distinct terroirs of the estate yet is mostly from the Bois S\u00e9n\u00e9chal lieu-dit, which is located just across the road from the domaine. This is still a little closed - it was only bottled a week before the tasting - but it's beginning to show some fresh honeydew melon scents and appealing texture. There's good concentration, though more of energy than defined flavours at this stage. It's lively and fairly tense, with a certain mineral aspect that helps bring balance. 36% Clairette, 29% Bourboulenc, 25% Grenache Blanc, 7% Roussanne and 3% Picardan, from vines averaging 45 years old and yielding 22hl/ha.\r\nDrinking Window 2018 - 2022 A blend of 36% Clairette, 29% Bourboulenc, 25% Grenache Blanc, 7% Roussanne and 3% Picardan, the 2017 Chateauneuf du Pape Saintes Pierres Blanc reflects the first vintage since the Guigal family took over ownership of this historic estate. It's a second wine, culled from elements that didn't go into the main cuv\u00e9e, but it's still a solid effort. It's an interesting marriage of linear notes of crushed stone and lime with rounder, riper notes of melon and tangerine. Medium to full-bodied, there's a chalky-mineral-tonic feel on the palate that keeps it lively through the fresh, clean finish.

The 2015 Canon is one of the undisputed stars of the vintage. An utterly mesmerizing wine, Canon has it all; From the very beginning, the 2015 Canon has made an eloquent case for itself as one of the wines of the vintage. Multiple tastings from bottle only confirm what several early tastings hinted at: the 2015 Canon is simply extraordinary in every way. Sumptuous and exotic, with no hard edges and exceptional balance, the 2015 grabs hold of all the senses and never lets up. A rush of red fruit intermingled with floral notes, spice and smoke notes effortlessly runs up the wine's vertical structure as the 2015 thrills with every twist and turn. The 2015 Canon is a rare wine that is both hedonistic and intellectual - well, maybe it is a bit more hedonistic-leaning. It doesn't matter. Don't miss it.

Cellar Selection A plush, inviting style, with warmed fig and plum sauce notes taking the lead, picking up swaths of cocoa, tobacco and roasted alder along the way. Features plenty of pumping bass, but if you pay attention, there\u2019s a laser of chalky minerality driving the finish. When the baby flesh drops away, this will sail in the cellar for some time. Best from 2022 through 2045. Composed of 72% Merlot and 28% Cabernet Franc and aged for 18 months in 70% new and 30% one-year-old barrels, the 2015 Canon is boldly fruited with blackberry preserves, black cherry compote, fruitcake, mocha and plum preserves with suggestions of Indian spices, licorice and black olives. Full-bodied and packed with ripe, rich dried berries and exotic spice layers, it has a firm, slightly chewy structure and just enough freshness (the pH is 3.78), finishing long and savory. Give it another 2-3 years of cellaring to soften its edges and allow its flavor spectrum to fully emerge, and drink it over the next 20 to 25+ years.

Although I can't claim any extraordinary differences between the two sessions, I noticed a few minimal shifts that are essential to understanding the wine's future aging ability. The 2016 Barbaresco starts off slow at first, showing a small margin of aromatic evolution in the glass. But come back two hours later, and you can almost hear the soft sounds of the symphony playing just below the surface. The 2016 vintage is characterized by the solid intensity and firmness of its aromas, which transcend fruit and veer toward balsamic herb, licorice, tar and smoke instead. The tannins offer a moment of sweetness and softness, before you are aware of their undeniable firmness. In all, there is a certain glossiness or satiny quality to the mouthfeel that underlines the wine's carefully crafted integration. I would describe this as a classic and also a somewhat austere Barbaresco that fully deserves extra cellar time to stretch those tight muscles and grow in volume. This wine will award those who wait. This is all about finesse with power. Such great length here with ever so refined tannins and precise strawberry, cedar, dried-rose and mineral character. Medium body. Fresh and vivid finish. Hard not to drink now, but wait until at least 2021. The Gaja family calls 2016 one of the best vintages they have ever experienced, with a long, slow ripening period without heat stress or disease pressure. That balance comes through in this suave, elegant Barbaresco. It smells of soft rose petals and tastes of juicy cherries and spiced raspberries, the flavors gliding along smooth, ripe tannins. With air, the wine picks up energy and depth, moving into a long, vibrant finish. The 2016 Barbaresco showed beautifully, with a classical yet seductive and sweetly fruited style that's going to evolve gracefully. Medium ruby-hued, with a core of sweet red fruits balanced by classic dried flowers, licorice, asphalt, and medicinal herbs, it hits the palate with medium-bodied richness that carries impress sweet fruit as well as building tannins. Barbaresco doesn't get more classic, and while it has a sunny, sweetly fruited style, it also has ample underlying tannins and structure, so give bottles 4-5 years. It should deliver the goods for two decades or more. The nose is poised, displaying very ripe raspberry and black berry aromas. The attack has intensity, partly thanks to its pungent acidity, but there's no rawness and the tannins are ripe. This is taut and structured and needs time. While concentrated, it's not excessively so, and the wine retains its delicacy through the very long finish.

The finish is medium in length, with dark fruits that slowly fade, leaving hints of savory herbs and a coating of fine tannin.

The nose expresses pleasant notes of fruit and sweet spices: plums, blueberry jam, leather, licorice root and balsamic sensations. The palate is lengthy and complex, accompanied by supple and elegant tannins. Blend: 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot", "reviews": "Beautiful center palate of fruit here with ripe and silky tannins that are resolved and fine-grained. Full-bodied, polished and ever so refined. Oyster shell, stone and hints of rosemary and lavender. Driven finish. Better after 2022. This stunning vintage of this landmark wine marks a slight adjustment to the blend. The 2016 Bolgheri Superiore Guado Al Tasso is no longer made with Petit Verdot. The blend is now 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and now 20% Cabernet Franc. This small change does not go unnoticed, as this wine is absolutely seamless now\u2014like the finest Asian silk fabric. That profound textural softness and suppleness changes the way the wine smells and tastes, with hints of momentary sweetness that are more tactile than anything else. Generally speaking, the 2016 vintage offers more elegance (slightly less concentration) and a hair more freshness compared to the 2015 edition. When I tasted this wine, the bouquet was still timid, but it will no doubt become more expressive and open as this beautiful wine continues forward along its aging trajectory. Some 120,000 bottles were made, a remarkable feat considering the extreme quality on offer. The 2016 Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso is dark, powerful and explosive, with a huge backbone of tannin that gives the wine its vertical feel and soaring intensity. Blackberry, graphite, chocolate, spice, menthol, licorice, cedar and lavender add to the wine's brooding, intense feel. A vibrant, substantial finish rounds things out in style. Readers will have to be patient, as the 2016 is an infant, but it is utterly breathtaking, even in the early going. From alluvial soil of mostly clay and sand, Guado al Tasso is Antinori's top Bolgheri wine. It's a classic Bordeaux blend this year without any Petit Verdot - less bold and rich in style than the 2015 but otherwise extremely elegant and drinkable. It's dark and concentrated, opening to aromas of restrained cassis, clean leather and a hint of earthy minerality. The firm yet ripe palate develops flavours of dense, supple brambly fruit and chocolate. It\u2019s a bit warming on the finish but is otherwise extremely well balanced. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this polished, savory red opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, cedar and warm spice. Reflecting the nose, the linear, vibrant palate delivers juicy blackberry, blueberry and licorice. A hint of camphor unfolds before transitioning into a peppermint close. Smooth, fine-grained tannins provide the elegant backbone. Drink through 2031. An exuberant style, boasting ripe black cherry and plum notes, with hints of coffee, chocolate and toasty oak. Lush and powerful, with a backbone of muscular tannins for support. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and\r\nMerlot. Best from 2021 through 2033. The 2016 Guado al Tasso is ripe and rich, its flavors of dark plum and dried cherries laced with notes of exotic black spices and dark chocolate.

Bud burst occurred around March 10th. The dry conditions continued into Spring and the warm weather in April and May encouraged rapid growth of the vines. June was extremely hot and the early cycle continued with v\u00e9raison around June 18th, one month earlier than the previous year. Conditions remained dry until the end of September although temperatures for much of the ripening season were moderate. As expected, the crop ripened very early, showing high sugar levels which led to longer fermentations and very effective color extraction. Picking started at Quinta de Vargellas on September 1st. The last time picking was recorded as having started this early was in 1945 when the first fruit was picked on September 3rd. Temperatures at harvest were mild, with cool nights, leading to balanced fermentations and excellent extraction. Opaque at the center with a narrow purple rim. The nose is threaded with fine, linear fruit, heady and complex but restrained by a graphite minerality. Signature fragrance of violets, which hangs like a scented veil over the wine with discreet terroir notes of citrus and wild herbs. The nose is reserved but there is impressive depth and background. The palate is held in place by lithe, muscular tannins, firm and grippy on the finish, and ends with a powerful surge of crisp, pure berry fruit. A beautifully delineated wine, with poise and definition and the tantalizing promise of pleasures still to come.", "reviews": "The 2017 Vintage Port, not quite bottled when seen but the final blend, is a field blend aged for approximately 20 months in wood. It comes in with 100 grams of residual sugar. A step up (or two) on the 2016, this shows fine depth, more focus, vivid fruit and serious power. It's not particularly thick, austere or astringent, but this is built for the long haul. It is potentially a great Taylor's, effortlessly combining brilliant fruit and structure. It tastes great now (today, it is far more vivid than its Vinha Velha sibling), but the power makes this hard to drink today. So, have some patience. It will need some time, probably a lot more than indicated, and will likely last longer than indicated as well. As noted in the accompanying article, I don't see much point to impossibly long drinking windows. At some point, reevaluation is required.\r\n \r\nAt the moment, it seems to be a step up on the Vinha Velha, although that is far more closed. I'd pick this today, but in time, both undoubtedly will have more tales to tell. Great young Ports go through many phases, and both are great young Ports. When ten-year anniversary tastings are done, this will have to be on the shortlist of greats to reconsider to determine how the best in the vintage are meeting expectations. Range: 98-100 This offers up a dense rumble of dark currant, fig and blackberry paste\r\nflavors, laced with hints of buckwheat, baker\u2019s chocolate and warm tar.

This 2017 has all the markers of a legendary Taylor Port\u2014scents of green fig, the complex tannic impact of schist, the consternating sense of elegance in the face of massive structural power. David Guimaraens bases this wine on fruit from the Quinta de Vargellas, an estate on the south bank of the river in the arid Douro Superior. In our tastings, it came after several 2017s that were sourced from vineyards on the north bank, closer to Pinh\u00e3o, and, while it would be simplistic to consider this a definitive difference (there are many exposures in each quinta, and other quinta parcels in the blends), there was a stark shift from the blackness of those wines to the sour-cherry impression of this wine, and its floral fraise des bois notes. Those flavors keep pushing up against the dark shadows of the wine\u2019s schist tannins, an undulating wake of red fruit and minerals that carries the wine\u2019s muscular power into memory.", "rating": "97.5", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/taylor-fladgate-vintage-port-2017/539508"},

Fruity, showing grip, this red offers currant, cherry, stony mineral and spice flavors. Offers a chalky feel, with a stone hint on the somewhat austere finish. Best from 2021 through 2035. The nose has a very flamboyant feel (25 per cent whole clusters) with plenty of brambly, darker cherries and spices. The palate has a very pure feel with velvety tannins, carrying red to dark cherries. Drink or hold.  Barrel Sample:  90-91 Ripe, juicy and packed with cherry fruits, this is a generous wine. It also has potential with its dense tannins and dry core. The wine needs time, so drink from 2023. COMMENTARY: \"Give that wine guy in the corner a bone.\" I meant to say, \"Beaune.\" The 2017 Bouchard P\u00e8re & Fils Clos de la Mousse lives on solid ground and is always one this area's best wines.

Its racy and riveting aromas and flavors of red fruit and chalk invite an evening with a perfectly-ripened round of \u00c9poisses de Bourgogne and a wedge of Comt\u00e9. Toss in a fresh baguette and the wine guy in the corner will be more than satisfied.

Full-bodied, tight and focused with firm and racy tannins. It really shows a laser-guided backbone of acidity and tannin. Serious all around. Drink in 2022. The 2013 Barolo Sarmassa is a robust and juicy expression of Nebbiolo from a classic vintage. Aged in both barrique and botte grande, the wine is silky and smooth with bright aromas of wild berry, smoke, grilled herb and white truffle. These aromas are delivered with a steady hand. This is a finely textured expression that offers ample length and persistence. Black-skinned fruit, iris, espresso, dark spice and a balsamic note all meld together in the glass along with a whiff of chopped herb. The firmly structured palate doles out ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, toast, roasted coffee bean and a hint of oak-driven spice alongside fine-grained tannins. Valentina Abbona describes the soil of the Sarmassa cru as 'strong'. Her parcel sits on a steep, heavily eroded slope leaving just clay and stone, which curbs vigour. Aged in a combination of French oak barrique and large Slavonian oak cask, it offers rose tea, black raspberry and grilled herb notes. Despite youthful austerity, the tannins are refined and supported by plenty of flesh, along with an appetising minerality and juiciness.\r\nDrinking Window 2021 - 2037 This red starts out with cherry, strawberry and floral notes, adding leather, underbrush and tobacco through the finish.

Most importantly, I tasted this 2016 vintage against the 2015 vintage over and over again. I confess to a few nights of restless sleep as a result. Ultimately, my decision to award 100 points to the 2016 Solaia came on impulse and with the most natural sense of purpose. I had also given the 2015 vintage a perfect score, and intellectually, it seemed impossible not to pick a favorite among these two stunning expressions. I will also state, outright, that the wines are very different, principally because the 2015 vintage shows more overall opulence and sweetness that extends to the pronounced textural richness of the mouthfeel. The 2016 vintage, on the other hand, is more chiseled and sharp with mineral shadings of campfire ash and graphite at the rim of its dark fruit. The mouthfeel is more streamlined and tight at its core, suggesting that the wine will unfold and soften beautifully with time. I feel like 2015 is the Dolce & Gabbana of the situation and the 2016 is the Armani Priv\u00e9. The personalities of the two wines are distinct, yet my admiration for each is identical. Speechless here. I thought the 2015 was already perfect but this is perfect, too. But in a different way. It is so structured and multidimensional. Full-bodied, powerful and intense with incredible tannin backbone and depth. The dark-berry, wet-earth, oyster-shell and mushroom flavors are phenomenal. 20% less production than 2015. Give it four or five years to come together. Try after 2025. This red leads off with a slight oaky edge, featuring vanilla and resin accents that meld with the black cherry and blackberry fruit flavors on the palate. This is all about purity and finesse, featuring a vibrant structure that fits harmoniously with the flavors. Cedar, iron, tobacco and fruit elements converge on the finish, which is very long, fresh and satisfying. Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2023 through 2040.

Smooth, tense and fresh on the palate, with great structure and persistence.", "reviews": "Fermented and aged in clay amphorae, this cinsault comes from the top of a hill in Guarilig\u00fce, near the Itata coast. Winemaker Marcelo Retamal has been playing with early harvests in search of redder fruit flavor and greater tension in this wine and, in the cool 2016 season, he achieved his goal. This is serious cinsault, its tea-leaf and earth aromas finely integrated into a layer of tart red fruit. While that fruit is crisp and vibrant, the depths of flavor are profound. All in all, it\u2019s a pleasure to drink, refreshing and charming. There is one more red Cinsault, the 2016 Cinsault Viejas Tinajas, also labeled as Itata since the change of legislation in 2015. This has moderate alcohol (12.1%) and is from the same vineyard that produced the Gallard\u00eda de Itata Cinsault. The destemmed but uncrushed grapes underwent a natural carbonic maceration in amphorae without any added products (yeasts or sulfur). The wine spent the winter in those amphorae, and after malolactic, in the spring it was bottled unfiltered, again without any added sulfur. The nose is incredibly clean and focused, fresh and with a mixture of wild berries and herbs, flowers too. The palate is light and fresh, with unnoticeable tannins but with the textured mouthfeel provided by the granite with great grip. This is the best version of this wine since the initial 2011 vintage. The amphorae seem to behave better, as they were abandoned in the fields and in the first years they lent an earthy feeling to the wines, as I also see with the new amphorae. A red with bright fruit and lots of watermelon and lemon aromas and flavors. Light body. Crisp finish.

That means that it is pretty fine, and in a great place. This is lovely and exciting, more or less along the lines of the last couple of releases that I saw. The Ramos Pinto 30 Year Tawny Porto is all about the complexity. It just wraps its nuances of butterscotch, vanilla, hazelnut, and sweet oak onto the palate and then some.

On the nose it is rich and ripe with notes of red fruits. The structure is full-bodied and intense with youthful tannins on the finish. Pairs well with fresh egg pastas, risottos, white meats, red meats, venison and cheeses.", "reviews": "Always one of my favorite wines from Produttori del Barbaresco, the 2014 Barbaresco Riserva Ovello lays out a broad and soft mouthfeel, with tannins that have already been polished and integrated thanks to ample time in the bottle already. It's safe to say that this Ovello cru loyally demonstrates the level of richness and textural softness that this site is known for. The bouquet is redolent of bright berry fruit with cherry, blackberry and plum. Also, the 2014 vintage was a warm one at the end of the growing season, and you taste a little bit of that ripeness here too. The 2014 Barbaresco Riserva Ovello is bright and piercing, as it so often is, and yet it also has more than enough fruit to fill out its mid-weight, energetic frame. Pine, mint, crushed rocks and sweet red plum build into the huge, piercing finish. The Ovello is another wine in this range that demands patience. Even in the early going it is super impressive. The 2014 s an unusually dense, packed Ovello. It should be terrific in another few years' time. Lovely aromas of perfumed berry, rose petal, aromatic herb and baking spice set the tone on this fragrant red. The ethereally elegant, medium-bodied palate is all about finesse and balance, delivering succulent red cherry, juicy\r\nraspberry, cinnamon and a dash of white pepper. It\u2019s nicely balanced, with polished tannins and fresh acidity. It\u2019s already accessible but will also age well over the next several years or more. Drink through 2026. Though the summer was cool and wet, the last rainfall in Barbaresco was on 12 August. Harvest started exactly two months later, allowing the grapes to ripen under much improved conditions. Quantities were down 30%, but quality was high enough for Produttori to craft their cru Riservas. Bottled 20 days prior to tasting, the 2014 is uncharacteristically forward with a veritable explosion of red cherry. Enchanting notes of rose petal, violet, blood orange peel and pepper follow. Bright acidity accentuates the tannins, but they are fine and dissolve effortlessly. While this comes across as approachable now, it might shut down in bottle and I'd give it some time following its release next spring. I suspect it will be a mid-term rather than a long ager. Balsamic aromas of menthol, wild thyme and juniper complement the black cherry core of this muscular red, with dense tannins lending support. Though a bit more severe now than its peers, this is balanced overall and will age well. Best from 2022 through 2042.", "rating": "94.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/produttori-del-barbaresco-barbaresco-ovello-riserva-2014/522441"},

I really have noticed that Beychevelle has raised its game over the last few vintages and it's maintaining that step-up here. The 2018 is built to age, and will do so with very little trouble. It has viole. t edging, a good ripe tannic structure and is full of life. It's rounded in terms of mouthfeel, smoothed out but not knocked off balance by the alcohol.

A wine like this needs revisiting every once in a while and you can taste the more focused and streamlined style in a recent vintage like this compared to one that may have been released ten or more years ago. The importance of a wine like this is that it creates a blueprint or a timeline for Sicilian winemaking in general. You can trace the stylistic changes through the years. In this case, dark fruit is followed by scorched earth, black olive and wild Sicilian fennel.

The Luigi Baudana 2015 Barolo Baudana, with fruit from Serralunga d'Alba, is a wine with a very promising aging future ahead. Starting with the firmness of its core and its tightly knit fabric, this wine offers all the main criteria for graceful cellaring. You get bright primary fruit, along with crisp acidity and rock-solid structure. You won't miss those characteristic Serralunga d'Alba tannins. Give the wine time to soften, relax and flesh out further. Still nervous in its youth, this pretty wine will award those who wait. This offers textbook Nebbiolo aromas of rose, forest floor, red berry, tobacco and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus.

From a cru named for the Baudana family, who have been farming vines in this corner of Serralunga for as long as anyone can remember, this Barolo rested for 31 months in large Slavonia casks, developing notes of dried leaves and graphite to balance its deep, rich tones of cherry and plum.

Tight, powerful and very intense, this is a big boy with the firmness you expect from fine Vintage Port, although the Fonseca is even more powerful. Showing good concentration and a fresh, lifted finish too, this is impressive at the outset. Initially, I was wowed by this. A few more tastes with more air made me think I'd like to see it prove some things in the cellar. It's not hot, but it seems a bit more alcoholic than its Fonseca and Taylor siblings. Still, there's a long way to go before making a final call. As noted, this is very tight, not nearly as approachable as many 2016s are in this relatively restrained year. It won't sear your mouth with tannins\u2014they are not TOO hard\u2014but you are going to have to cellar it a while to allow it to acquire more complexity and more harmony.

By then it will have gained silky elegance and complexity. But you can enjoy it earlier, if you prefer a more intense, fruity experience. It will go on for many years after that too. Vintage Port should be served in generous wine glasses, not the small thimble-like glasses in which most of the aromas and flavours are lost.

On the third day open, the wine\u2019s restraints are slightly less tense, the flavors hinting at licorice and black cherry with a mellow schist reverb.

Floral, silky and nuanced to the core, the 2016 is a wine of pure and total seduction. Freshly cut flowers, vibrant red fruit and creamy tannins all add to the wine's undeniable allure. In 2016, Prieur\u00e9-Lichine is all class, not to mention one of the sleepers of the vintage. Don't miss it! Tasted two times. With vineyards in the southern Margaux village of Cantenac, this estate has produced a deliciously juicy wine. The structure follows a straight line between the tannins and the intense fruit and acidity. The wine should age well, ready to drink from 2024. Rich and velvety red in colour with deep violet reflections, the brushed velvet appearance carries over to the texture on the palate. A good lineup of fruit flavours are joined by sweet softness through the mid-palate that widens things out rather than dips, and there's a slow build to the finish. Matured in 50% new oak. 2016 yielded 43hl/ha. A very suave, polished Margaux that delivers iodine and dark-stone aromas and a wealth of ripe, plush dark fruit that follows through to the palate in attractive, fleshy and juicy mode. Try from 2022. A restrained style, with a beam of cherry, cassis, lilac and sandalwood flavors, revealing a good fleshy feel and solid depth throughout. Light perfume and tobacco hints give the finish some added range. No fireworks here, just balance and focus. Best from 2021 through 2032. The 2016 Prieure-Lichine has a medium to deep garnet-purple color and a bold, intensely scented nose of warm blackcurrants, black raspberries and mulberries with hints of cedar chest, tobacco, dried herbs and iron ore. Medium-bodied, the palate has bags of class with lovely, vibrant black berries flavors and earthy sparks framed by ripe grainy tannins, finishing long and refreshing. Although putting a very fine first foot forward with its easy-toget aromas of cherries, raspberries and slightly sweet, dusty soil,\r\nbut despite initially in step upon entry, this wine grows a bit tight\r\nin progression and pulls back from its early flush of fruit. It is not\r\nwildly tannic, nor does it suffer from impolite astringency, but its\r\nfinish stands in contrast to the open accessibility with which it\r\nbegins and tags it as one that needs a wait of several years\r\nbefore fully blossoming.", "rating": "93.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-prieure-lichine-2016/153274"},

Best from 2035 through 2055. \u00a0This 2017 has all the markers of a legendary Taylor Port\u2014scents of green fig, the complex tannic impact of schist, the consternating sense of elegance in the face of massive structural power. David Guimaraens bases this wine on fruit from the Quinta de Vargellas, an estate on the south bank of the river in the arid Douro Superior. In our tastings, it came after several 2017s that were sourced from vineyards on the north bank, closer to Pinh\u00e3o, and, while it would be simplistic to consider this a definitive difference (there are many exposures in each quinta, and other quinta parcels in the blends), there was a stark shift from the blackness of those wines to the sour-cherry impression of this wine, and its floral fraise des bois notes. Those flavors keep pushing up against the dark shadows of the wine\u2019s schist tannins, an undulating wake of red fruit and minerals that carries the wine\u2019s muscular power into memory. This is a dry while also floral wine, perfumed and enticing with its juicy acidity. At the same time, the structure is very present, showing power and dark black fruits. The balance is coming together with the rich fruits and tannins melding into one.

Marco Cirillo learned to prune these ancient vines from his father, their roots running deep through the sandy soils down to limestone and clay. He destems the fruit into open-top fermenters, uses a basket press to manage the extraction of the tannins and then ages it for two years in older French and American oak barrels, then two years in bottle. His preference for a late harvest shows in the ripeness of the fruit and the raciness of the alcohol, but it\u2019s lovely fruit, and the alcohol seems to point up the layers of resinous flavors, from eucalyptus to pine sap, cinnamon and bitters.

{"name": "Chateau Figeac (Futures Pre-Sale) 2018", "origin": "St. Emilion, Bordeaux, France", "price": 246.97, "abv": "14", "description": "An attractive, deep, bright, purple color. An expressive, air-light nose leads on to Figeac freshness and aromatics, followed by floral notes mingling harmoniously with nuances of fruit and underpinned by aromas of blackcurrants and raspberries. The palate is expressive and vibrant, cadenced by a clean powerful entry, an enveloping and velvety mid-palate reminiscent of 2015 vintage, and a fresh, lean finish accompanied by tannins of a finesse and minerality that recall the 2016 vintage. The greatness of this vintage is embodied by the amazing harmony between the round and eveloping Merlot, the fresh and elegant Cabernet Franc, and the lace-textured, tender Cabernet Sauvignon. The Chateau Figeac 2018 delivers here the perfect chord from its famous three grape varieties. Blend: 37% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc", "reviews": "This is pretty gorgeous, with velvety texture that lets nearly exotic cassis, plum and blackberry fruit reduction flavors roll through. Has a beautiful bass line of warm earth and smoldering tobacco notes all while keeping its sensational mouthfeel. The encore on the finish makes you realize this is the serious gourmet stuff. One of the highlights of the vintage. Barrel Sample:  97-100 This shows wonderful precision and focus with dark-berry, tobacco, and blueberry character. Full-bodied, tight and vivid. Solid and structured. Really powerful for Figeac. The real new style here of Figeac that harkens back to the great wines of the 1950s and 1940s. This year, equal parts of merlot, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc. Barrel Sample:  98-99 This is a rich, velvet-textured wine. The Cabernet duo in the blend gives this wine immense structure and brilliant acidity. The perfumed, black currant fruits are layered with the acidity and crisp freshness. The wine finishes with some formidable tannins for the future. Barrel Sample: 97-99 The 2018 Figeac is composed of 37% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc, harvested September 17 to October 12 with a 3.7 pH and 14% alcohol. Deep purple-black in color, it charges out of the gate with vivacious black and red cherries, cassis, warm plums and wild blueberries scents plus fragrant hints of violets, star anise, tilled soil and forest floor with wafts of Ceylon tea and chocolate box. Full-bodied and jam-packed with energetic, crunchy black and blue fruits, it has a rock-solid, firm, grainy frame and loads of bright, refreshing sparks lifting the dense layers on the very long, savory finish. Wow\u2014the Cabernet really makes itself known this vintage, and it is good. The signature of this wine is so clear, so defined, that this is a Bordeaux wine without peers. In my view, this is the finest Figeac ever produced.  Barrel Sample:  97-99 Tasting like a hypothetical blend of the 2015 and 2016, the 2018 Ch\u00e2teau Figeac offers that rare mix of elegance and sexiness that makes it the most M\u00e9doc-like wine from the Right Bank. Checking in as a blend of 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc that will spend 19 months in new oak, made from 75% of the total production, it offers a saturated purple color as well as incredible notes of liquid violets, exotic flowers, cr\u00e8me de cassis, and spice box. Full-bodied, multi-dimensional, flawlessly balanced, and with awesome purity of fruit, it\u2019s going to flirt with perfection in 4-5 years and keep for 3-4 decades or more. Hats off to director Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Faye for another viscerally thrilling wine that\u2019s up with the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the vintage.  Barrel Sample:  97-99. The 2018 Figeac is simply magnificent. A regal, soaring wine with tremendous vertical lift and nuance, the 2018 is marvelously complete from the very first taste. All the elements fall into place effortlessly. Medium in body and refined, the 2018 is vibrant, with fine tannins and, frankly, quite a bit more freshness than I expected to see given the very dry, sunny summer. Rose petal, mint, lavender and spice add nuance to a core of red/purplish fruit. Harvest started on September 17 and finished on October 12. Yields were 39 hectoliters per hectare, just shy of the historical average of 42/32. While mildew pressure was an issue, it was the dry October winds and their dehydrating effect on the last Cabernets that impacted yields most. Like so many of his colleagues, Technical Director Frederic Faye and his team opted for gentler vinifications with no SO2 at crush, lower temperatures in fermentation and smaller pumpovers. The 2018 Figeac is brilliant. That's all there is to it. The blend is 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc. Tasted three times.\r\n Barrel Sample:  96-99 Back to a more traditional blend after last year's frost impact, Figeac has done a wonderful job of harnessing the opulence of the vintage while maintaining freshness. This is extremely focussed and precise, with a silky texture and inky depths, developing complexity as the flavours unfurl. These are big tannins but they steal up on you, doing that subtle creep that's such a marker of the vintage. Powerful, utterly gorgeous and clearly a wine that will age well, this is equal to the estate's excellent 2016.

Having said that, it veers close to being too austere and hard-bodied, especially at this young stage of its life. Of Sandrone's two new Barolo releases, this wine definitely needs more time to evolve and soften with extra years of bottle aging. The tannins are more evident and the wine's firm backbone acts to support dark fruit flavors with distant accents of spice, licorice and tobacco. With a core of cherry flavors and assertive tannins, this Barolo is right out of central casting. Accents of mint, tar, tobacco and tea add dimension. Best from 2020 through 2035. Enticing scents of pressed rose, wild berry, scorched soil, leather and menthol take shape in the glass. The juicy, savory palate doles out red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, baking spice and grilled herb alongside ripe, velvety tannins.

All these elements combine to yield a wine that shows lush ripeness and crisp firmness, opposing forces creating a certain raciness we like to describe as \u2018tension\u2019.", "reviews": "2016 is one of the best vintages ever in Bolgheri, classic in style and balanced. It has a 'great sense of the classics without denying the past, a fully-fledged, more modern wine,' according to Axel Heinz. Crimson and dense in colour, it's full of restrained, brambly fresh fruit, clove, nutmeg and a salty butteriness, combined with velvety, masked tannins on the palate. It is at perfect phenolic ripeness, supported by refreshing natural acidity balancing the 14.5% alcohol. This will last for decades. From a great vintage for Bolgheri, the 2016 Ornellaia is a classic blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc, and 4% Petit Verdot that was aged 20 months in 70% new French oak. Its saturated purple color is followed by a deep, beautifully concentrated yet primordial effort that offers serious intensity in its cassis, black cherry, graphite, bay leaf, forest floor, and spring flower aromas and flavors. Full-bodied and multi-dimensional on the palate, it has thrilling purity of fruit, ample tannins, and a great, great finish. This is a tour de force in red wine that needs 4-5 years of bottle age and will keep for two decades.\r\n\r\n Rating: 98+ The 2016 Bolgheri Superiore Ornellaia is a wine of extreme complexity and precision. It offers monumental depth with profound layers of black fruit, coffee, licorice and baking chocolate. I tasted this 2016 vintage beside the less-impactful 2015 vintage (which was reviewed last year). These two editions are very different when compared side to side, and this 2016 release is clearly superior in terms of the quality, clarity and intensity of its offerings. This Ornellaia delivers glossy shine and a polished texture that segues to important richness, concentration and textural fiber. It wraps thickly over the palate, imparting waves of sweet dark fruit and dark spice that linger for many long minutes. This beautiful wine is hitting the market now, but collectors will want to put it straight into their cellars for safekeeping. An astoundingly vibrant, powerful and concentrated Ornellaia that has a wealth of intense dark cherries, mulberries and plums with hints of espresso, dark cocoa powder and cedar. The concentrated palate is framed in long, regal tannins that bring focus to the plush, ripe and fresh black cherries and dark plums. Extremely balanced. Best from 2025. Black currant, plum, cedar, lead pencil and toasty, spicy elements highlight this intense red. Muscular tannins line the extended finish, leaving a peppery impression. The parts are all there but need time to integrate. Cabernet\r\nSauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2023 through 2043. Just bottled, the 2016 Ornellaia is a dense, powerful wine. Naturally, the 2016 is just at the beginning of its life, but I am struck by how polished the tannins are for such a young wine. Ornellaia is at its best starting around age ten, but there is little doubt the 2016 is a hugely promising wine. Black cherry, chocolate, plum, new leather and a range of spice notes all build into a veritable crescendo of aromas, flavors and textures.\r\n Rating: 96+ Cedar, French oak and cassis aromas follow over to the vibrant palate along with coconut and dried black cherry. Racy acidity lends energy and youthful tension while firm fine-grained tannins offer elegant support. It\u2019s still young and primary so it give it time to fully develop.

As distinctive a Bordeaux as there is these days. Best from 2025 through 2040. Bruno suggests the 2018 might be a little like the 1961, but instead of frost at flowering they had mildew.

Very fine bubbles.  On the nose, it has a beautiful aromatic complexity, ripe fruit and spicy aromas, with hints of roasted apples, apple compote and peaches.  On the palate, there is a subtle combination of structure, length and vivacity.  The bubbles are like velvet.  Flavors of pear, brioche and spicy aromas, notes of fresh walnut.

This wine has been consistently excellent. The current Special Cuv\u00e9e Brut seems a bit fresher and brighter than past efforts. TASTING NOTES: This wine is beautiful. Its aromas and flavors of ripe apples and light yeasty notes\u2014enhanced with a touch of chalkiness\u2014should make it an excellent choice with clams and linguine in a reduction sauce of white wine, slivered garlic, and freshly-cracked black pepper. (Tasted: September 24, 2018, San Francisco, CA) Bollinger's NV Brut Special Cuv\u00e9e is a blend of 60% Pinot Noir, 25% Chardonnay and 15% Pinot Meunier, and the grapes are mostly (more than 85%) sourced in Grand Cru and Premier Cru villages. The majority of the Special Cuv\u00e9e is reserve wines, part of which have been aged in magnums for five to 15 years. The disgorgement I tasted in May 2018 displays an intense golden-citrus color and has a refreshing, concentrated bouquet of citrus fruits, sweet cherries, ripe apples, white flowers, toast, walnuts, ripe apricots and peaches, with just a touch of brioche. On the palate, this is an intense, very elegant and refined cuv\u00e9e with a very long, refreshing, intense, aromatic and salty finish. This is an excellent Champagne with a beautiful chalky texture in the aftertaste. Lovely aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry and currant fruit, graphite, toast and candied Meyer lemon zest are set in this racy Champagne, with a refined, finely detailed mousse. The mouthwatering finish is long and spicy. Bollinger\u2019s NV Special Cuv\u00e9e knocks it out of the park. Made from 60% Pinot Noir, 25% Chardonnay and the rest Pinot Meunier, with 30% of the blend brought up in barrels, it boasts a rich, deep, medium to full-bodied style as well as terrific notes of lemon curd, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, caramelized stone fruits, and hints of toasty nuttiness that develop with time in the glass. It\u2019s a big, rich Champagne that stays balanced and pure. Beautiful stuff. As always with this producer, this iconic nonvintage cuv\u00e9e is dominated by Pinot Noir that gives impressive richness as well as ripe stone fruits. Wood fermentation adds further complexity as does the age of this bottling before release. Drink this Champagne now. Fine bubbles combine nicely with the cooked apples, pie crust and lemon rind. Some biscuit, too. Full body. Layered and creamy with a crisp finish. Always delicious. Drink now. 60% Pinot Noir; 25% Chardonnay; 15% Pinot Meunier. All Bolly in its toasty, chalky, slightly angular but powerful way, this wine reminds of the company's \"Grande Annee\" in its fairly bold approach. Frothy and insistent in its bubbles and tasty, rich, toasty, stony and vanillin all at the same time, this is Champagne with a purpose, and, in this case, it works without being over the top in any dimension. Cool and generous, this is a bold, lusty Champagne with pinot-inspired scents of violets and flavors of dark berries, the wine structured by its time in oak. It\u2019s a vinous Brut, suited to roast fish and light game.", "rating": "92.375", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/bollinger-brut-special-cuvee-3-liter-bottle-jeroboam/120615"},

It starts with an explosion of fruit, blackcurrants, blueberries and cherries, that then gives way to a spring-like freshness. The nose reveals notes of broom and rosemary, like a walk through a field of flowers and a forest of eucalyptus. On the palate, we find a whole raft of delicate, smooth flavours.

Blend: 77% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Franc", "reviews": "Showing spectacularly, the 2017 Chateau Canon checks in as a final blend of 77% Merlot and 23% Cabernet Franc that\u2019s from one of the most exceptional terroirs in the appellation. Hitting 14% alcohol (the pH is 3.66), it reveals a ruby/purple hue as well as gorgeously sweet raspberries and cassis-like fruit interwoven with notes of spring flowers, rose petal, white chocolate, and spice. While it doesn\u2019t have the massive opulence of the 2015 and 2016, it\u2019s more classically styled as well flawlessly balanced, with a terrific sense of minerality, ultra-fine tannins, and a brilliant finish. Give bottles 5-7 years in the cellar, and it will evolve gracefully for 30-40 years. Hats off to Nicolas Audebert as well as the team of Thomas Duclos for one of the wines of the vintage! Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2017 Canon bursts from the glass with expressive notions of baked black cherries, kirsch, plum preserves and black raspberries plus hints of red roses, Ceylon tea, black olives and fertile loam. Medium-bodied, the palate is wonderfully elegant and refined, with a soft, finely grained texture and seamless freshness, finishing long and mineral laced. The blend is 77% Merlot and 23% Cabernet Franc and it was aged for 18 months in French oak, 50% new.  Rating: 96+ Extremely perfumed with blackcurrants, flowers, gunmetal, gunpowder and blackberries. Full-bodied, tight and reserved. The tannins are so tightly knit and just run through the center. Needs at least three or four years to open. A blend of 77% merlot and 23% cabernet franc. Better after 2023. Dark and dense, this is a massive wine. Big tannins are paralleled by concentrated blackberry fruits to give a wine that is both juicy and impressively rich. Structure and power are likely to be tamed as the wine ages. Drink from 2024. Canon remains pretty austere at this stage with the Cabernet Franc dominating. It's not as immediately seductive as some years, but you can feel the bedding down of the tannins, restraining the elegance and floral minerality but not hiding it completely. Sit with it in the glass and you start to feel a wine that rises above the vintage. This is one of the very few where you feel that in 10 years time it will clearly be better than it is today, most do not have that grace and confidence. I love the juicy finish here. 50% new oak. Drinking Window\u00a02025\u00a0-\u00a02040 A subtle savory note leads the way, backed by ample cassis, plum and black cherry fruit aromas and flavors.

Medium to full-bodied, the palate is an exercise in elegance and soft-spoken nuances within a mouth-coating palate of almost electric black and blue fruits, framed by very firm, exquisitely ripe, fine-grained tannins and seamless freshness, finishing epically long and wonderfully perfumed. Damn, that\u2019s good.  Rating: 98+ The grand vin 2017 Chateau Leoville Las Cases checks in as 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc, and 10% Merlot, harvested between the 15th of September and the 4th of October. Brought up in 90% new French oak, it has an incredibly classic style that carries loads of creme de cassis, crushed rock, graphite, and smoked tobacco-like aromatics. These carry to a full-bodied, concentrated, elegant Las Cases that has fine tannins, flawless balance, and a great finish. It shows the refined, regal style of this estate, has beautiful richness and depth, and is going to drink nicely with just 5-7 years of bottle age.

Black truffle, liquorice, cinnamon spice, saffron, slate and cigar box all comprise - this is a standout wine in the vintage. They just know how to tease flavour out of the ground at this place. Yes it is closed, not exactly forbidding but certainly austere, with big tannins, but less so than in some vintages at this stage, and it unrolls in the mouth. Deep purple colour, but not black. Coffee and spicy oak and seed-wood aromas. Packed extract and very complex flavours of spices, clove, earth, toast and black fruit. Very complex. Balanced fresh acidity with bright cherry-like freshness, but deep cassis and almost nutty complexity. Very good indeed. \r\n Barrel Sample:  95-97 A very focused, very pure rendition, laden with cassis, plum reduction and boysenberry puree fruit that is mostly waiting in reserve. A cold cast iron edge imparts a sense of restraint, while smoldering tobacco, charcoal and alder notes are deeply buried on the finish. The opposite of flamboyant. In need of time. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Best from 2025 through 2040. The watchword for this wine is style. Tannins underline the fruit.

Great notes of blackcurrants, smoked tobacco, gravelly earth, mocha, and hints of licorice all flow to a medium to full-bodied wine that has remarkable purity of fruit as well as polished tannins. It builds nicely with time in the glass and reminds me of a toned-down version of the 2016. This complex, elegant, flawlessly balanced Pessac can be drunk today with incredible pleasure or cellared for 15-20 years. I have found that Magrez estates have done exceptionally well in 2017, pretty much across the board, but here I feel a reach towards the barrel that is just the slightest bit out of step with the ripeness of the fruit. The tannins are flexible and in control, but it just lacks a touch of the opulence in the black fruits that was so abundant in 2015 and 2016.

Full-bodied with dense and integrated tannins and a long, long finish. It is all there and all about proportional harmony. Excellent focus and beauty. Drink in 2022. Very tightly focused, with both charcoal and iron harnessing the core of dark currant and blackberry fruit flavors. Sleek in feel, but not for lack of depth, as this is brimming with dark fruit and terroir, just in a more austere fashion.  Barrel Sample:  94-97 Points. At 94% (85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Cabernet Franc) this is the highest-ever Cab content in this grand vin. Very dense at first but full of power and elegance, with lots of energy.

It almost tastes like a St-Julien rather than a Pauillac as they're so fine and elegant, but the Pauillac character becomes more apparent by the close of play - there's no hiding those swirling cassis, smoke and menthol notes.

It's extremely powerful and precise, with poise and tension but also with generosity and density, yet it errs on the side of not giving much away rather than giving too much. You have to give it time in the glass for those cool blueberry, bilberry and tightly spiced notes to come to the fore. The stunning texture is clear but the aromatics take their time. This is a wine that carries its finesse with great skill, and they have done a brilliant job of allowing this aspect to shine amongst the heat of the vintage, allowing the density to inch deeper with every minute in the glass.

There are quince trees in the estate and they give the name to the wine (membrillo is the Spanish word for quince). This is a plot bordering Altamira that was planted with Cabernet when they bought it. They have now also planted Malbec and Cabernet Franc, so this wine will change in the future. They won't bottle the 2014 and 2015 vintages that were not good years for Cabernet in Mendoza. It's not easy to detect the grape here anyway. I see more similarities with the Canal Uco bottling to which Sebastian Zuccardi responded that the soils are very similar. The wine has very good freshness with fine tannins coating a fine thread of lively acidity. They have four different types of soils here and they used three for this wine. When the soils are very shallow the Cabernet has a tendency to dry out and the tannins can feel a bit harsh, so they need to find good balance using deeper soils to obtain these buttery tannins with the variety. The oak is a lot more noticeable since they use more new oak with the Cabernet than with Malbec. It has classic aromas of the oak-aged Cabernet, quite different from the Malbecs, mint, damsons, blackberries, something earthy, graphite even, cigar box and spices, and with the telltale tannins of the variety where the earthiness is more pronounced.

Linear line of tannins that runs nicely through the wine. A blend of 70% cabernet sauvignon, 24% merlot, 4% cabernet franc and 2% petit verdot.

A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, brought up in 75% new French oak, the 2017 Chateau Lynch-Bages sports an inky color as well as a powerful, full-bodied style. Rocking blackcurrants, chocolate, smoked tobacco, and obvious minerality all emerge from this beautiful, concentrated wine that has building tannins, the more elegant, silky style of the vintage, a great mid-palate, and a blockbuster finish. It's going to hit the ground running in about 5-7 years and cruise 20 years or more in cool cellars. Another wine that is packed with Pauillac signature; one where you feel the tightness and the bristle of the tannins. They have done a great job of carefully extracting the tannins while maintaining a fresh menthol current running through the backbone of the wine. The fruit lacks a little plushness and concentration compared to the 2016 or 2018, but this is impressive. It's a year where names count, and Lynch Bages is claiming its place at the table. This leans toward the austere side of Pauillac, with a slightly bracing iron and chalk frame around a core of red and black currant fruit, liberally laced with savory and cedar notes. Exhibits ample length and cut, showing really pure and beautifully defined currant flavors. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2024 through 2040.\u00a0 Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2017 Lynch Bages sashays out of the glass with flamboyant scents of baked blackcurrants, blackberry preserves and mulberries plus touches of lavender, dark chocolate, star anise and unsmoked cigars.

Slightly deeper ruby in color, it has a mix of both red and blue fruits, salt, violets, damp earth, and smoked earth. Deep, tight, backward, but just loaded with potential, it needs 3-5 years of bottle age and will be very long lived.\r\n\r\n Rating: 98+ From the moment you stick your nose in the glass, you are immediately struck with something special. The 2016 Syrah Armada Vineyard has fantastic focus on the nose, with black fruits and a grippy core of minerality, revealing some soft truffle tones and black spices along the way. Full-bodied on the palate, the wine shows an impressive weight and continues to gain in breadth and depth, expanding and unfolding on the mid-palate. Beautifully structured flavors of cured meats and peppercorn evolve with incredible mineral tension and dusty red fruits, and the wine ends with a long, thought-provoking finish. The Armada Syrah is collector-worthy. The 472-case production leaves me speechless. This has a very attractive fragrance to the dark cherries and blackberries with such pure fruit expression. There\u2019s also a more tightly composed feel to the tannins on the palate, which Christophe Baron attributes to closer planting in this plot. The heart of the wine is as pure as it is strong. This is impressive. Try from 2022. Aromas of potpourri, smoked meat, earth, cracked pepper and lily lead to a dense, rich palate with intense fruit, savory and floral flavors. The palate shows more overt density than the other wines from this vintage, while remaining lively, energetic and exquisitely balanced. Potpourri and smoked meat linger on and on. Best after 2024.

As with the other Symington properties this issue, this was bottled in May 2018 for release in October 2018. This shows the same good fruit as the Warre's, but in a much drier and sterner fashion, at least perceptibly and at least at the moment. It does have a fairly high sugar level on paper (normal-high, not over the top). As it sat and aired, it became more powerful, not less, showing plenty of intensity. Tight, tannic and a little astringent, this lacks expressive fruit as yet, but its laser-like precision will serve it in good stead. I loved that firm feel. It needs at least a decade to come around, though. It has a lot of upside potential, but it's linear and compact just now. Let's start here and see where we go when it opens up a bit more. \r\n  Rating: 93+ This\r\nfinely perfumed wine has ripe tannins and\r\nrich fruit.

The palate is simply electric, charged with an energy and depth of flavors that seem to defy the elegance and ethereal nature of its medium-bodied weight, featuring super ripe, densely pixelated tannins that firmly frame the myriad of fruit and floral sparks, finishing with epic length. Just. Magic. The grand vin 2016 Cos d'Estournel checks in as 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot, and 1% Cabernet Franc that saw 70% new French oak.

There's no question that this is a monumental Cos, with the walls of slate ready to be scaled, joined by a rosemary and black olive tang, juicy liquorice root and lashings of cassis. I tasted this wine both en primeur and again during a vertical at the property in July, and have felt thrilled to recommend it each time. Aymeric de Gironde was still the director at the time, before leaving in 2017. Powerful tannins show strongly in this elegant, structured wine.

Blackberry jam, graphite, spice, menthol, licorice, pencil shavings and spice are all finely sketched in a bold, savory Pauillac that hits all the right notes. The 2016 Pichon Comtesse has been riveting on each of the four occasions I have tasted it from barrel thus far, making it easily one of the wines of the vintage. Nicolas Glumineu and his team turned out an epic Pichon Comtesse in 2016. Don't miss it! Coming from the genius winemaking talent of Nicolas Glumineau, the 2016 Ch\u00e2teau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande matches the 1982 and is a perfect, legendary wine in the making.

It gets better and better as you return to it, and I'm really impressed with the texture and depth of the silky-smooth palate: pure cassis notes alongside hawthorn, hedgerow and liquorice.

Full body yet tight and reserved. Superbly refined tannins. Yet rich and flamboyant. Fruity yet salty and minerally. Electric finish. Stone and chalk undertones. A wonder of a young wine. The 2015 Canon is one of the undisputed stars of the vintage. An utterly mesmerizing wine, Canon has it all; From the very beginning, the 2015 Canon has made an eloquent case for itself as one of the wines of the vintage. Multiple tastings from bottle only confirm what several early tastings hinted at: the 2015 Canon is simply extraordinary in every way. Sumptuous and exotic, with no hard edges and exceptional balance, the 2015 grabs hold of all the senses and never lets up. A rush of red fruit intermingled with floral notes, spice and smoke notes effortlessly runs up the wine's vertical structure as the 2015 thrills with every twist and turn. The 2015 Canon is a rare wine that is both hedonistic and intellectual - well, maybe it is a bit more hedonistic-leaning. It doesn't matter. Don't miss it. This 2015 is masterpiece from General Manager Nicolas Auderbert and his team at Canon.

Best from 2022 through 2045. This estate, now performing on top form, has produced a rich, dense wine. Swathes of black fruits underline the generous structure and intensity. At first taste, the tannins are soft but that turns out to be an illusion. The tannins are just richly cushioned within the beautiful fruit. Drink from 2024. Cellar Selection Composed of 72% Merlot and 28% Cabernet Franc and aged for 18 months in 70% new and 30% one-year-old barrels, the 2015 Canon is boldly fruited with blackberry preserves, black cherry compote, fruitcake, mocha and plum preserves with suggestions of Indian spices, licorice and black olives. Full-bodied and packed with ripe, rich dried berries and exotic spice layers, it has a firm, slightly chewy structure and just enough freshness (the pH is 3.78), finishing long and savory. Give it another 2-3 years of cellaring to soften its edges and allow its flavor spectrum to fully emerge, and drink it over the next 20 to 25+ years.

The 2002 was a candidate for perfection the first time I tasted it. The estate keeps this cuvee 32 months in 100% new French oak, so I had a number of chances to see it from barrel. Moreover, I purchased the wine for my own cellar and have had it at least a half dozen times since bottling, and it just gets more profound with each sip. This wine is beyond belief for how it balances its extraordinary richness, purity of personality, and the elegance and finesse of the Stags Leap District with massive cassis fruit, spring flowers, toasty oak and earth. The wine is fabulously concentrated, multidimensional and built like a skyscraper, yet nothing is out of place. The wood, alcohol, acidity and tannin are all in perfect balance. This offering is a tribute to the greatness of Napa Valley, which was recognized by men and women hundreds of years ago, and to the modern day genius of the Shafer family. This 2002 has 50 years of life ahead of it - but why wait! Very young, rich and extracted, this boasts a dense, powerful presence and tannic core flavors of blackberry, black licorice, cedar, mocha, roasted coffee, loamy earth, vanilla and dried herb. A tour de force of flavor, ending with ripe, muscular tannins. The impression is of a young, tannicly closed but enormously promising Cabernet. Floods the mouth with dramatic black currant, cherry and chocolate flavors, masses of toasty, caramelized new oak, and a rich, minerally earthiness. For all the power, there\u2019s elegance and refinement. The vines that produced John Shafer's first cabernet in 1978 now form the core of Hillside Select, from the small knolls surrounding the winery. They grow in a sweet spot of the Stags Leap District, farmed since the mid-eighties by Doug Shafer and winemaker Elias Fernandez; since 1991, they have consistently produced one of the top wines of the Napa Valley. Those vines yielded an intensely structured 2002, posh with supple cabernet fruit and dark minerality in the tannins. It feels sleek even as the delicious berry flavors burst out of the tannins and last. Extremely young and fresh, this will start to reach peak drinking 10 to 15 years from the vintage. In what has proven to be a sometimes difficult year, Shafer shines once again with this spectacular, immensely extracted Cabernet . Underpinned by a wealth of concentrated cassis-like fruit, shot through with rich, loamy spice and awash in altogether extravagant oak, it is a wine that does not speak in hushed tones but comes with plenty of drama. For all of its very considerable weight and undisguised power, it still shows a fine sense of overall balance, and the evident tannins and heat that emerge in its very long finish are beautifully buffered by its deep and wholly compelling fruit.", "rating": "96.4", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/shafer-hillside-select-cabernet-sauvignon-2002/90456"},

Perfect end of the season weather did justice to this outstanding grape variety, revealing red and dark fruit followed by notes of liquorice, cocoa and rare spices. The dark color reflects the abundance of tannins, which are refined and fresh, invigorating and ultra-powerful but still charming and well balanced. Exceptional length rounds off this wine's superb expression.", "reviews": "Borderline perfection in a bottle, the 2010 Pichon-Longueville Baron (79% Cabernet Sauvignon and 21% Merlot) boasts a saturated purple color as well as truly extraordinary aromatics of cr\u00e8me de cassis, licorice, crushed rock-like minerality, graphite, and spring flowers. Possessing full-bodied richness, a huge, unctuous mid-palate, and building tannin, it shows the purity, grandeur, and precision that makes this vintage so remarkable. Hide bottles for another 4-5 years, count yourself lucky, and enjoy bottles over the following 2-3 decades.\r\n\r\n Rating: 99+ This is quintessential Pauillac, a great wine with its Cabernet proudly at the fore. It ranks with the 2009 and, with its tannins, is sure to age longer than that vintage. Solidly structured, powerful and dense, with fruit promised for the future, it succeeds with its weight and great concentration. Deep garnet in color, the 2010 Pichon-Longueville Baron delivers expressive scents of baked black cherries, plum preserves and cr\u00e8me de cassis with hints of cedar chest and bouquet garni. Medium to full-bodied, the palate has a firm backbone of grainy tannins and lovely freshness with bags of energetic black fruits and a long, wonderfully pure finish. Solidly built, with a roasted edge to the steeped fig, blackberry and black currant flavors, quickly followed by brambly tannins and notes of bay leaf and espresso. Stays dark and tarry through the finish, with superb drive and verve. Best from 2017 through 2030. A dense and layered wine with lots of ripe and sweet fruit. Loads of currants, plums and tar.

She allowed the greatest terroirs, whatever their grape variety, to bring their fruit to exceptional ripeness, providing a wine of wonderful concentration, finesse, balance and freshness. The Cabernet has no equivalent other than 2005, but it is more tender. The only two batches of Merlot that were kept have no equivalent at all. As for the Cabernet Franc and the Petit Verdot, they performed at their highest levels. Blend: 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot, 2% Cabernet Franc, 2% Petit Verdot", "reviews": "If you want to drink a Margaux 2009 any time soon, you need to go for the Pavillon - the grand vin is still extremely young, holding back its power and impact for another five or 10 years time. It's still closed up enough to hint rather than reveal. The smooth, silky tannins are joined by blackberry and cassis fruit with a great sense of vibrancy and concentration, and some tingling minerality with a pulse of electricity. There's a latent generosity here, a slow confidence that builds through the palate as the flavours layer up, yet it's clear that there's still lots to be revealed, particularly the hints of violet and peony florality that just peek through on the finish. This is very, very good - up with the best ever from this estate. 31% of production went into this wine, and it has the same amount of Cabernet Sauvignon as in 2005. 2% Petit Verdot completes the blend. This marathon runner is currently in the no-man's land between youthful vitality and mellow maturity. There's a very serious tannin structure here, but it needs a lot longer to fully resolve. Very tight and closed. A perfect wine usually. But not today. Try in 2020. The 2009 Ch\u00e2teau Margaux is deep garnet in color and features wonderfully fragrant minted cassis, lilacs, black forest cake and oolong tea scents with touches of pencil shavings and dusty soil. Medium to full-bodied, it has a firm, grainy frame with lovely freshness lifting the perfumed fruit to a very long, mineral-laced finish. A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of opulent fruit are also elegant and structured.  Cellar Selection This offers gorgeously caressing fruit, with steeped plum, blackberry and red currant notes, finely embroidered with accents of rooibos and black tea, tobacco leaf, alder and sandalwood. Delivers loads of fruit, with the structure already melded into the core of fruit\u2014but that's the vintage style. A stunner, though I still find the '10 a full step ahead.

The tannins are very fine-grained, but decisively austere and, together with the vibrant acidity, they propel the finish out towards infinity and leave a breathtaking final impression. A blend of 56 per cent merlot, 37.5 per cent cabernet sauvignon and 6.5 per cent cabernet franc. Very long aging potential, but you could try it in 2023. Immensely tannic, this is a great Haut-Brion, one of the finest for many years. It shows the severe side of this estate, with a dense structure to match the powerful black fruits. Rich with berry flavors and lifted by enough acidity, the wine will age for many years. Drink from 2026. \r\n\r\n Cellar Selection The 2016 Haut-Brion is quite possibly even more magnificent from bottle than it was from barrel. Powerful and rich, yet not at all heavy, the 2016 is a wine of nearly indescribable beauty. Haut-Brion is often a thrilling wine, but it is rarely this finessed in its youth. Gravel, cure meat, tobacco and cedar are some of the many nuances that develop with air, but it is an extraordinary sense of harmony that really stands out. What a wine! The 2016 Haut-Brion is blended of 56% Merlot, 37.5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6.5% Cabernet Franc. Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the nose is at once profound and arresting, offering drop-dead gorgeous Morello cherries, lilacs and red rose scents with a core of Black Forest cake, warm blackcurrants and blueberry preserves plus wafts of sandalwood and underbrush. Medium-bodied, the elegantly crafted palate is completely packed with intense floral, mineral and cassis-laced flavors with a firm frame of very finely pixelated tannins and seamless freshness, finishing very long and achingly stunning. This has a little more reticence initially on the nose than La Mission, but after a few minutes the rich texture begins to reveal itself, with charcoal, tobacco, dark plum and damson fruits that are straining at the leash. It has hidden power and subtle oak toasting - this clearly feels no need to shout about its presence, but there will be plenty to discover over time. You can feel those tannins licking around your teeth, building up one layer at a time. A great wine En primeur that has settled into greatness. Large and in charge, this has a prodigious core of steeped plum, black currant and loganberry fruit flavors that show\r\nboth compote and coulis aspects. While that steeps, this delivers a sturdy frame of roasted mesquite, smoldering\r\ntobacco and incense, surrounding a muscular spine of worn cedar and tar. Still rather backward, this will be showing\r\nwell when most others from the vintage have had their day. Best from 2025 through 2045. As to the reds, the 2016 Haut Brion is a prodigious, legendary wine in the making, although it\u2019s not for those seeking instant gratification. Deeper colored and more concentrated than the La Mission Haut Brion, it reveals a purple/ruby color as well as a sensational bouquet of blackcurrants, cassis, cigar tobacco, cold fireplace, violets, and lead pencil. Deep, masculine, structured, and mineral-laced, it has a stacked mid-palate, full-bodied richness, building tannins, and a firm, blockbuster styled finish that lasts for close to a minute. A wine for the ages, don\u2019t even think about opening bottles for at least 7-8 years. It should keep for half a century.

Medium-bodied with a great mid-palate core of red and black fruits, it has a solid, grainy frame and compelling freshness, finishing long and minerally. A little reserved - surprisingly so for Carruades at this stage - but then 2016 is an architectural vintage that's not overly generous when young.

Sappy, tongue-coating pastis, blackberry coulis and loganberry fruit starts this huge wine off, followed by a parade of licorice snap, violet, tar, black tea, roasted alder, wood spice and steeped black cherry fruit notes. A beam of pure cassis drives through this, and the finish pulls everything together with a mouthwatering brambly edge that should soften slowly over time. A riveting display of brawny power, unbridled energy and high-level terroir. Best from 2020 through 2040. A firm and serious wine, complex and complicated, one of the finest wines from 2010 vintage. It has a rich undertow of black fruits, while the tannins dominate at this stage. To add to the powerful range of flavors, the wine has an edge of severity that bodes well for its long-term future.

This unctuously textured, full-bodied 2009 possesses low acidity along with stunning extract and remarkable clarity for a wine with a pH close to 4.0. The good news is that there are 10,500 cases of the 2009, one of the most compelling examples of Haut-Brion ever made. It requires a decade of cellaring and should last a half century or more. Readers who have loved the complexity of Haut-Brion should be prepared for a bigger, richer, more massive wine, but one that does not lose any of its prodigious aromatic attractions. Extravagant and exotic, but still lively, this is a super-concentrated and elegant wine that's already breathtaking, yet has enormous aging potential. Plenty of wet earth and mushroom character alongside the cassis and blackberry aromas. Super-long, perfectly balanced finish. Drink or hold. This enormous young wine is among the most backward of the vintage at this early stage, with iron-clad grip holding the broad, deep core of blackberry, cassis and roasted fig notes in check for now. The finish is a torrent of dense, almost compressed layers of tobacco leaf, hot paving stone, singed bay leaf and tar that will take at least a decade to come together. This one is for the kids born in 2009. Best from 2020 through 2040. Inky purple in colour, this has a rich, intense nose of damson, blackberry and olive paste. The palate is generous in texture and weight, more broad-shouldered than Ch\u00e2teau Margaux - which is already beginning to show its florality. This is balanced but well built in every inch. The warmth of the vintage coming through as fruit ripeness, liquorice, spice and punch, with the beginnings of truffle notes. There's no question of its excellence and its bonhomie. Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year.", "rating": "98.4", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-haut-brion-2009/117332"},

On the palate, the wine is dry with a clean fruitiness and crisp refreshing finish. Mt. Beautiful Ros\u00e9 pairs beautifully with fresh run salmon bake, Thai beef salad and an afternoon by the pool.

Lively and rich, both juices were blended together and co-fermented in stainless steel tanks and 15% French oak barrels. The current vintage of this wine is a more complex and less overtly ripe expression than the previous year's and it's lovely to see a ros\u00e9 with more strings to its bow. It sings to the tune of cherry blossoms, orange rind and dried herbs. It's dry, slippery and refreshing. There's a bitter note at the finish but this would be a fun one to experiment with food pairings; likely that finish would become unnoticeable with a well matched meal. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Mt. Beautiful Ros\u00e9, blended from 65% Pinot Noir and 35% Pinot Gris, is a tasty and delicious wine. TASTING NOTES: This is a pretty pink wine with plenty of bona fide flavors.

A huge, dramatic, blackcurrant and wild-blackberry nose and the first impression on the palate is every bit as intense. Nice acidity lifts this massive structure and keeps the imposing finish so fresh. Drink or hold. Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2016 Lagrange sashays out of the glass with notions of candied violets, cassis, underbrush and warm black plums with waves of Black Forest cake, cedar chest and yeast extract scents. Medium to full-bodied, the bags of perfumed black fruits are solidly structured with super ripe, grainy tannins, finishing long and layered. The acidities are more vibrant up in St-Julien than in the lower stretches of the M\u00e9doc. An excellent Lagrange, this is every bit as good as it was en primeur, with a similar fruit quality doing a lovely vertical trick through the mid-palate where you can feel each individual element's weight, but cushioned on a bed of air. Ruby in colour with some violet around the edges, this wine is well made and built to last. Chewy tannins and black fruits make this fairly Pauillac in style. At 50% of total production in 2016, this represents the highest proportion of grand vin for years following replantings back in the 1980s. COMMENTARY: Over the past twenty years, Ch\u00e2teau Lagrange has been one of my consistent Saint-Julien favorites. Always making sure the wines' fruit remains expressive, this wine never uses wood to overpower its true essence. In the 2016 vintage, the winery has produced one of the top wines from this already highly acclaimed vintage. TASTING NOTES: This wine is on point with its balance and richness. Its aromas and flavors of ripe red and black fruits, with just an accent of oak, should pair it deliciously with lighter as well as richer meat dishes. (Tasted: January 25, 2019, San Francisco, CA) A textbook St.-Julien, with a fleshy yet focused beam of plum, blueberry and cassis flavors striding through, while warmed anise, sweet tobacco and iron notes play backup through the finish. Mouthwatering grip will allow this to cellar nicely. Best from 2024 through 2038. The Grand Vin 2016 Ch\u00e2teau Lagrange checks in 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, and the rest Petit Verdot brought up in equal parts new and used barrels. It shows the fresher, elegant style of the vintage and offers beautiful black cherry and cassis fruits intermixed with tobacco leaf, damp earth, and cedar. Medium to full-bodied, beautifully pure, seamless, and layered, it has a vibrant, tight texture, terrific tannin quality, and a great finish. It's a quintessential expression of this vintage. Give bottles 4-5 years and enjoy over the following two to three decades. Surprisingly light for the vintage, this is an attractive, black-currant-flavored wine. It is open, with tannins integrate easily into the fruitiness.

A thrilling bottle of wine that readers should snatch up is the 2016 Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Armailhac. This deeply colored, medium to full-bodied, powerful Armailhac gives up a lovely perfume of blackberry and plums fruits, violets, graphite, cedar pencil, and earthy, herbal nuances. Classic, ripe, layered, and just a beautiful Pauillac any way you look at it, it has plenty of upfront sex appeal but is going to keep for 20-25 years as well. Bravo! The 2016 is a blend of 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot.

Medium-bodied, the palate has a rock-solid frame of firm, grainy tannins and wonderful freshness, finishing long and earthy. This juicy red sports dark plum, fig and boysenberry fruit backed by an equally strong wave of bramble and sweet tobacco notes. The cast-iron spine pins down the finish, so give this a little time to integrate fully. Best from 2023 through 2038. There's fairly high acidity on the attack here, and yet it's well balanced by a body that's richer and deeper than in many years of Armailhac. You can definitely feel the texture and the powerful depth of brambly fruit, and there are also some of the signature lilting floral notes, given extra charge through graphite, liquorice, cassis, and that pulsating acidity. Great quality. 2% Petit Verdot completes the blend. That Pauillac was especially blessed in the 2016 vintage is affirmed once again here, and, while not always an estate that achieves striking success, Ch\u00e2teau D\u2019Armailhac shines in this incarnation. It is ripe, rich and concentrated with continuous, very confident, ever-so-slightly juicy young fruit reaching well into its very long-lasting finish, and, if is it appropriately tannic for a Cabernet-based wine of its age, its high percentage of Merlot is manifest in its teasing early suppleness and its welcome step-back from austere astringency This is a ripe wine, full of black fruits with attractive\r\ntannins.

It has a beautifully defined, very detailed bouquet with mineral-rich black fruit laced with cedar and graphite notes, living up to its nom de plume as the \"Pauillac of Margaux.\" The palate is simply the best that I have ever tasted at the estate, without question. This has presence, but also weightlessness, filigree tannin and perfectly pitched acidity, with real intensity and drive. The tension here is outstanding and the persistence is incredibly long. It is not the showiest of all the 2016s by a long stretch, and yet it is everything you could possibly want from a Margaux.

I missed this wine in my recent 2016 Bordeaux report, but I was able to purchase a bottle locally. A tremendous Margaux, the 2016 offers the quintessential elegance of the appellation as well as plenty of density, concentration, and ripe tannins. Beautiful notes of blackcurrants, tobacco leaf, cedarwood, and flowery incense all emerge from the glass, and it builds nicely with air, offering medium to full body, flawless balance, and a great finish. This is classic Margaux as well as a classic 2016. It\u2019s already approachable, and I doubt it will close down, yet it\u2019s going to develop additional nuances with another 4-6 years of bottle age and have 25-30 years of prime drinking.

Possessing full-bodied richness, a rounded, surprisingly opulent, sexy texture, awesome purity, and sweet, succulent tannin, it\u2019s a sensational 2014 that might just surpass what they accomplished in 2015. This is a 2014 you won\u2019t regret buying in bulk as it\u2019s going to keep for 2-3 decades and be drinkable for the vast majority of it. Bravo to Alfred Tesseron and his team! The 2014 Pontet-Canet, now in bottle, was tasted twice during my trip to Bordeaux. It has an attractive bouquet: graphite tinged black fruit, incense and violets, perhaps a little more hedonistic than I envisaged when I tasted it from barrel. The palate is medium-bodied with tensile tannin thanks to the keen line of acidity. I like the precision of this Pontet-Canet. It feels linear and correct, pencil lead notes developing towards the second half, more quintessentially Pauillac than previous vintages, with what you might describe as a classic Pauillac finish that retains the focus that I remarked upon from barrel. Tasted February 2017. This delivers a notable menthol note, showing an ample core of well-steeped blackberry, plum and black currant fruit. A bright anise streak checks in on the back end, with a slightly loamy structure.

Deep purple-colored, full-bodied, beautifully concentrated, and just about off the charts in terms of scale and density, it nevertheless just glides across the palate with an ethereal, seamless texture that never seems heavy or cumbersome. This is pure Pauillac in all its glory and is a monumental wine in every way. Drink it any time over the coming 4-5 decades. Deep garnet colored, the 2009 Pontet-Canet is a little shut down to begin, but with coaxing this baby is soon firing on all cylinders with a full-throttle nose of chocolate-covered cherries, cr\u00e8me de cassis, boysenberries and spice cake plus tons of kirsch and cranberry sauce sparks and a beautiful undercurrent of emerging tertiary characters: cigar box, sandalwood, chargrill, truffles and cast iron pan. Full-bodied, rich, multilayered and completely seductive, the palate is charged with incredible energy, with a firm backbone of velvety tannins and seamless freshness providing solid grounding and promising a very long life ahead. It finishes with an incredible display of epically long-lasting flavor fireworks. Wow! Stunning aromas of fresh flowers, with blueberries, blackberries and currants that follow through to a full body, with super balance and finesse. The tannins are super polished. Such class here. Best ever from here. From biodynamically grown grapes. Try in 2018. This is amazingly expressive now considering how huge it is, with stunning espresso and warm fig confiture aromas followed by lush layer after layer of blackberry paste, cassis and plum sauce. A terrific loam underpinning strides in on the finish, which is weighty but sports serious cut. Equal parts fruit and earth. Best from 2018 through 2038. Sumptuous black-fruits nose, vividly aromatic, as well as minty, stylish, and toasty. Very rich, broad, full-bodied and generous, with very ripe tannins and a lot fo spice. Perhaps slightly lower acidity than usual but has punch and persistence all the same. Approachable, just, but will benefit from more age.

The refined and tightly-knit tannins give way to a very long, deliciously mineral, almost saline finish.", "reviews": "Both 2013s are clearly the finest Eisele wines made under the administration of Fran\u00e7ois Pinault and his top lieutenant, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Engerer, who also runs the show at Ch\u00e2teau Latour. The utterly compelling 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon in this vintage and 1,800 cases were made. The wine is off-the-charts great, with an opaque bluish/purple color to the rim, an aroma of pen ink, graphite, blackberry and blueberry fruit, a hint of licorice, camphor and incense. The wine is full-bodied, with extraordinary concentration, remarkable equilibrium and noticeable, but sweet, well-integrated tannin. This is a large-scaled Eisele Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, but flawless and with no edges. It is an amazing effort and a great achievement from this incredible terroir. Drink it over the next 30-40 years. The aroma of dried rose petals is stunning. Hints of dark fruits too. Intensely perfumed. Full-bodied, deep and condensed with incredible depth and subtlety. Powerful tannins that are hidden under the beautiful fruit. The finish lasts for minutes. Precise and gorgeous. Very tight. Needs four to five years to soften and amalgamate. One of best ever from Araujo? The first wine from grape to bottle from the new owner, Francois Pinault, who also owns Ch\u00e2teau Latour. A deep-pitched bouquet of fresh red-black fruit, deep soil tones and floral top notes introduces a youthfully primary wine with a refined, three-dimensional tannic structure and signature Eisele minerality. The first wine produced 'from berry to bottle' by the Pinault regime is thus a great success, with notably superior barrel integration to some of its predecessors. The vineyard is now front-and-centre: on the label, and in the bottle. Pure and pleasantly focused, driven by a supple core of dark berry, licorice, sage, underbrush and mineral notes that stand up to the cedary oak.

Lifted aromatics, bright, red-toned fruit and silky tannins add to the wine's brilliant, chiseled personality. I find the 2017 more precise and nuanced than in the recent past, with less overt power. It's hard to know exactly if the style of the 2017 is a result of the growing conditions of the year, or the result of an evolution in winemaking that includes the introduction of terra cotta, among other things. I certainly get the sense Guillaume Pouthier reined the wine back a bit in 2017. No matter. The end result is all that counts, and in 2017 Les Carmes Haut-Brion is positively stellar. As always, the high percentage of Cabernet Franc and a healthy dollop of whole clusters give Les Carmes an explosive bouquet and plenty of saline-infused energy.

There's a great complexity of flavours with touches of blackberry, liquorice, chocolate and rosemary, and although it's not as intense as most recent vintages of Carmes, this is well defined. The tannins are ready to go to work - there is a sweetness to the fruit that I have not found in all the wines, and suggests good ripeness. The savory edge of Cabernet Franc is still very much to the fore at this point, and there is good life ahead. One to look out for! Offering an Haut-Brion-like level of purity and precision, the 2017 Chateau Les Carmes Haut-Brion (41% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot, and 29% Cabernet Sauvignon) sports a vivid purple color as well as perfumed notes of blueberries, blackberries, unsmoked tobacco, crushed violets, and spring flowers. It\u2019s not a blockbuster in the mold of the 2015 or 2016 (or 2018), but it has medium to full body, a beautiful elegance and purity, notable minerality, and an exceptional finish. It opens up with time in the glass, and I was able to follow a bottle for 3 days without it ever showing a hint of oxidation. Give bottles 4-5 years of bottle age and enjoy over the following 30 years or more.

Saturated glass-stainingly deep colour. Already lots of sweet spicy oak aromas. Warm black fruit and blueberry scents. Very rich approach with deep black fruits, some damson and plum. If there was anything green going on in the vineyards, then it went into the Carillon, because it is not present here. Black and concentrated fruit. Depth and power, but with freshness. A really good example of a success in the vintage. Mouthcoating grainy tannins on\r\nthe finish suggesting a long life ahead, but super-complex and deep.\r\n Barrel Sample:  95-97 This is jazzed up a bit, with dark anise and black tea aromatics leading off, followed by juicy blackberry, boysenberry and bramble notes. Has some flashy spice on the finish and some expensive-feeling toast, but everything is in lockstep as this moves along. Barrel Sample:  93-96 \u00a0While this wine has density and richness, the structure gives it an ageworthy shape. Its power is tamed and given sophistication, while acidity and black-plum flavors give freshness. The wine will be impressive. Drink from 2024. Some frost impact (seen in the 70% Merlot and lower Cabernet Franc than usual), but clearly not getting in the way of success, this Ang\u00e9lus has flesh, texture, depth of colour and plenty of succulent autumnal fruit. Without the concentration of the biggest years but still full of quality, clarity, precision. Tried in both bottle and carafe, which gave an excellent insight into how it will age - the aromatics come through more clearly after just 10 minutes in the carafe, and the width and depth to the blackberry and blueberry fruits increase, as does the tension through the palate. Hangs on too, this is good. A blend of 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Franc, the deep purple-black colored 2017 Ang\u00e9lus is a little closed to begin, opening out beautifully to notes of baked plums, fresh blackberries and chocolate-covered cherries with hints of mocha, bay leaves, beef drippings and wood smoke plus a touch of roses. Medium to full-bodied with a great density of mid-palate fruit and firm, fine-grained tannins, it finishes long and earthy with a compelling lift.\r\n\r\n Barrel Sample:  94-96", "rating": "96.42857142857143", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-angelus-futures-pre-sale-2017/422622"},

Showy and beautiful. Sourced from the Les Murets (80%) and L'Hermite (20%) lieux-dits, the 2015 Hermitage Ex Voto Blanc is a big, full-bodied wine that was 100% barrel-fermented in new oak. Toast marks the nose, but the wine is shut down right now and perplexingly difficult to evaluate. The long, crushed-stone finish suggests better things lie ahead. Rating: 94+? The Guigals make Ex Voto only in years they consider exceptional, and focus the white wine on two parcels of the Hermitage hill: the rocky, alluvial Les Murets, and the sandy loess soils of L\u2019Ermite. Mostly marsanne, vinified and aged for 30 months in new oak casks, it\u2019s a lush, full-bodied white that wraps its mineral flavors in warming notes of caramel and spice. While the oak is very present, it\u2019s also in proportion to the depth of fruit and firm structure, which bodes well for this wine\u2019s development over the next 10 to 15 years. Smoke, cedar and vanilla tones are pronounced now, but plenty of succulent white peach, apricot and tangerine pulses at the core of this generous white.

Those vines yielded an intensely structured 2002, posh with supple cabernet fruit and dark minerality in the tannins. It feels sleek even as the delicious berry flavors burst out of the tannins and last. Extremely young and fresh, this will start to reach peak drinking 10 to 15 years from the vintage. In what has proven to be a sometimes difficult year, Shafer shines once again with this spectacular, immensely extracted Cabernet . Underpinned by a wealth of concentrated cassis-like fruit, shot through with rich, loamy spice and awash in altogether extravagant oak, it is a wine that does not speak in hushed tones but comes with plenty of drama. For all of its very considerable weight and undisguised power, it still shows a fine sense of overall balance, and the evident tannins and heat that emerge in its very long finish are beautifully buffered by its deep and wholly compelling fruit.", "rating": "96.4", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/shafer-hillside-select-cabernet-sauvignon-15-liter-magnum-2002/139902"},

A true journey through flavor, the palate revels in the creamy sensation\nof juicy plums. This wine is characterized by a silky texture reminiscent of fig pie, pine nuts, and sweet pastries.

Ample, full and round, this is a lovely matured Ros\u00e9 with a super intense and aromatic Pinot character (sweet cherries, red berries). The finish underlines the great complexity, purity and finesse of this vinous Ros\u00e9. There are cherry aromas again in the long aftertaste. An impressive Ros\u00e9. A pale hue in the glass, this has a savory nose that delivers a very nicely struck toasty edge with chalky pastry and faint red fruits. The palate's sophisticated fine texture is mesmerizing. This really dances, leaving a trail of red berry fruits in its wake, through to a long, pure and fresh, spicy finish. This focused ros\u00e9 Champagne offers a mousse with the texture of raw silk, which swathes the firm frame in layers of roasted hazelnut, baked peach, toasted brioche and cr\u00e8me de cassis flavors, with a rich and smoky underpinning and accents of candied kumquat, espresso and ground ginger and cumin that expand on the finish. Drink now through 2030. This is a pale-colored wine with a finely wrought texture and great fruit. It is tight and mineral on the one hand, but balanced with the crispest red-currant flavors that offer a bright line in acidity. Delicious hints of age round out the final fresh aftertaste. COMMENTARY: The 2006 Charles Heidsieck Champagne Ros\u00e9 is a classic. TASTING NOTES: This hauntingly delicious wine is refined and long in the finish. Enjoy its bright red fruit and aromas with grilled salmon fillets. (Tasted: September 9, 2019, San Francisco, CA) The brisk focus of fruit grown in limestone gives this wine\u2019s pinot noir depths of fruit a firm shape and brash tension.

A dense, opaque wine with classic Fonseca aromas and flavors: dense blackberry and blackcurrant, spice, coffee, cocoa, and prune. Thick, velvety tannins give the wine a voluptuous density on the palate. This wine will develop for decades in the bottle. Pairs well with blue cheese and desserts made with dark chocolate or berries.

It comes in with 98 grams of residual sugar, a little drier on paper than its Taylor sibling this year. Sappy and sensational in flavor and fruit, this seemingly has moderate tannins around the edges on first taste, velvety texture and a long finish. Despite the first impression of moderation, there is plenty of power here. As it got some aeration, it showed nothing but power and closed down fairly hard. The combination of great fruit and fine structure makes this a potentially great Fonseca, but right now it is obviously immature and not showing everything it has. I'd recommend some patience here.

Lovely full, ripe tannins mass in the mouth, well defined, with fresh berry fruit remerging on the broad, expansive finish. This wine contrasts sunny black-cherry lusciousness with sous bois shadows of schist, black mushroom and conifer. Then there\u2019s the dark-chocolate freshness that pegs it as a Vale Mendiz classic, grown in the hills above Pinh\u00e3o. The arid year lent tar-black earthiness, and the oak is a little prominent right now, but neither impinges on the wine\u2019s clear identity.

Whereas 2016 had a very mild winter and exceptionally hot summer, this was compensated by abundant winter and spring rainfall. Conversely, 2017 was warm and drythroughout, although summer temperatures were closer to average, whichproved to be a very significant factor allowing for complete, balancedripening. It is rare to see such tremendous depth and intensity in color as this winedisplays. The freshness of the floral aromas is very attractive with adominance of rockrose, a flower that grows wild around the hills of Senhorada Ribeira. On the palate, it is exceptionally full-bodied, rich andpowerful with black fruit coming to the fore. Gorgeous, ripe fruit isbalanced by the fine tannin structure. On the finish, it is typically Dow,austere and somewhat drier than many other ports. The intense fruit flavors linger long on the palate.", "reviews": "Pure grape aromas that remind me of fermenting must but then goes to stems and dried flowers. Full-bodied, medium sweet with fine-grained tannins that coat your palate. Powerful and muscular yet remains agile and beautiful. Grows on your palate. Wonderful ripe fruit in the middle palate. Try after 2030. Based on fruit from the predominantly south-facing Quinta do Bomfim in the Cima Corgo and Quinta Senhora da Ribeira in the Douro Superior, with Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca making up 80% of the blend. This is opaque and closed in but powerfully ripe with underlying pure berry fruit. It's seemingly quite introverted compared to some of its peers at this stage, but it's still full, rich and opulent on the palate. It also shows the latent power of the vintage, made as it is in a slightly drier style (3.4 Baum\u00e9), with lovely minty fruit and full, ripe sinewy tannins all the way through the finish. Long and lithe, and very fine.\r\n \r\nDrinking Window 2035 - 2060 The 2017 Vintage Port, bottled in May for release in the third quarter of 2019, is mostly a 42/38 blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca with old vines and miscellaneous others (including about 8% Alicante Bouschet) for the rest. It was bottled about a month before this tasting after 18 months in seasoned vats, but the just-bottled sample was not actually used for fear it might be in shock. This, accordingly, was actually a pre-bottling sample. It comes in with 106 grams of residual sugar. Rating: 94-96 A dense, thickly textured version, dripping with warm salted licorice, tar and a\u00e7a\u00ed paste notes, while plum and blueberry p\u00e2te de fruit, chai spice and chocolate elements fill in behind. Lots of brambly grip flows underneath. Shows a very sappy feel on the finish. Best from 2035 through 2055. This is a dry while also floral wine, perfumed and enticing with its juicy acidity. At the same time, the structure is very present, showing power and dark black fruits. The balance is coming together with the rich fruits and tannins melding into one. Drink from 2028. This 2017 has all the markers of a legendary Taylor Port\u2014scents of green fig, the complex tannic impact of schist, the consternating sense of elegance in the face of massive structural power. David Guimaraens bases this wine on fruit from the Quinta de Vargellas, an estate on the south bank of the river in the arid Douro Superior. In our tastings, it came after several 2017s that were sourced from vineyards on the north bank, closer to Pinh\u00e3o, and, while it would be simplistic to consider this a definitive difference (there are many exposures in each quinta, and other quinta parcels in the blends), there was a stark shift from the blackness of those wines to the sour-cherry impression of this wine, and its floral fraise des bois notes. Those flavors keep pushing up against the dark shadows of the wine\u2019s schist tannins, an undulating wake of red fruit and minerals that carries the wine\u2019s muscular power into memory.", "rating": "96.33333333333333", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/dows-vintage-port-2017/539507"},

The wines immediately showed plenty of color and a complete array of very intense aromas ranging from red and black fruit to spice and incense.

After blending, the wines still have the same aromatic intensity and complex, full-bodied structures which barrel-maturing should further enhance.", "reviews": "Decadent and rich aromas of black cherries and plums with wet earth and sandalwood. Turns to dried mushrooms. Full-bodied, tight and closed with big, polished tannins, yet this is very closed and shy right now. Despite this, underneath it shows such depth and beauty. Tangy acidity. This is a combination of 2005 and 2009. Try it in 2024. The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me from the northern M\u00e9doc is the 2015 Mouton Rothschild and this incredible wine flirts with perfection. Made from 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, and 3% Petit Verdot, this inky purple-colored effort offers sensational Cabernet flare in its cr\u00e8me de cassis, graphite, lead pencil shavings, floral, and Asian spice aromas and flavors. It is full-bodied, dense, and incredibly concentrated, yet still has the sexy, opulent, seductive style of the vintage front and center. It will be a candidate for perfection in 10-12 years and is going to be one of the longest-lived wines in the vintage. Hats off to Philippe Dhalluim and his team for this incredible effort that\u2019s a step up over just about every other northern M\u00e9doc out there! The 2015 Mouton Rothschild is a blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc aged in 100% new oak with a mid-July 2017 bottling. Deep garnet-purple colored, this Mouton pulls off an incredibly impactful entrance, emerging from the glass with profound notes of blackberry preserves, plum pudding, cr\u00e8me de cassis and grilled meats, featuring perfectly accessorized accents of sandalwood, cinnamon stick and fenugreek with wafts of dried roses, unsmoked cigars and tilled soil. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is completely packed with rich, ripe black fruits sparked with blue and red fruit undertones and an incredible structure of very firm, very ripe tannins, with seamless freshness and an epically long, earth-laced finish. Possessing striking natural beauty framed by impeccable crafting, this 2015 is a total diva and well worth attention. Give it a good 7-8 years in bottle, at least, and drink it over the next 30+ years. This is a hugely opulent wine, packed withblack fruits, rich tannins and great concentration. It is a gorgeous wine that's full of potential, with the dense, dark core showing how well this wine will age. Drink this complex wine from 2027.\r\n\r\n Cellar Selection My joint top wine (with Ch Margaux) of the vintage. A real firework display but still controlled. Very rich on the palate: broad yet silky, earthy yet so refined. This is Mouton at a new peak and it\u2019s hard to imagine a better balance of elegance and power. Offers a prodigious core of steeped fig, black currant and blackberry compote flavors, enmeshed with notes of smoldering tobacco, charcoal and licorice. Broad, deep and long, with a deep foundation of graphite through the finish. Despite the heft, this manages to show off some purity too.

The complexity of the layers are still on display, showcasing fresh menthol, cranberry, white pepper, black olive, rose and blackberry, all wrapped up in a tight tannic hold. There are some wonderful toasted caramel notes, subdued but rich and tight, waiting to show their exuberance on the finish. There's no doubt that this is as good as I thought en primeur, but it needs time to open up, and I would suggest the full 10 years. 2% Petit Verdot and 1% Carmenere finish up the blend.

The blend is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot, and the balance Petit Verdot and Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re, all aged 16 months in 50% new French oak. A fresh and stylish version, with chalky minerality running from start to finish. Succulent plum and cassis fruit flavors coil around this and absorbs this easily at first. Then pretty violet and lilac notes guild the finish, with the minerality taking a slightly firmer stand. Best from 2023 through 2035. The Cabernet Franc was fantastic this year, so it was all used in the grand vin. The final blend is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc, 2% Petit Verdot and 1% Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.

Medium to full-bodied, the palate has a firm frame of finely grained tannins and seamless freshness lifting the perfumed fruit to a nice long finish.\r\n\r\n Rating: 94+ Densely fruited with fine tannin support and a good deal of ready ripeness to its credit, this year\u2019s Clerc Milon ups the ante in richness relative to past offerings and fully demonstrates the success of Pauillac in 2016.

The 2012 Dominus Red\u2014a blend of 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 2% Cabernet Franc, and 5% Petit Verdot\u2014is one of the winery's best efforts to date. Currently a brooding wine\u2014displaying brooding black fruit, dust, and tar\u2014this wine looks like a keeper and one that requires time in the bottle. (Tasted: October 10, 2016, San Francisco, CA) If you\u2019re used to riper styles of Napa Valley cabernet, give yourself time to adjust to the savory profile of one of the region\u2019s oldest vineyard sites. Dominus sits on a rocky alluvial fan, a gentle benchland slope nestled into the western hills of Yountville. If, like some of their neighbors, Christian Moueix and Tod Mostero pushed the vines to extreme ripeness, you would find a sweeter wine in the glass. But they prefer to farm the vineyard so they can capture it at the moment when the grapes will sustain their distinctive flavors, yielding precision and detail in their tannins rather than the creamy smoothness that has come to define Napa Valley luxury wine. In fact, the 2012 vintage does provide a hint of sweetness in the end, red-fruited, bright and filled with youthful energy. That energy circulates through the wine in the fresh scent of bay and madrone, while the tannins gird the fruit for a long life ahead. Deftly balanced, with an enticing mix of gravelly, loamy earth, dried berry, cedar and cigar box, all rich and extracted. Ends with raw, assertive tannins.

Enjoy its aromas and flavor of ripe fruit, rustic earth, savory spices, and chalky stones with a clove-studded smoked shoulder of ham.

This vintage produced large berry sizes for Sangiovese\u2014something Bibi Graetz is always happy to see because it is an indicator of elegance and finesse within the context of the house style. If you consider this wine, his observation makes perfect sense. This warm vintage is powerful and rich in its natural state, so any additional berry density might easily lead to overextraction and heaviness. However, the mouthfeel is objectively thinner and more compact in this vintage. Colore represents a blend of Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Colorino in equal parts. The bouquet is redolent of wild berry, dried cherry and toasted spice. This vintage offers a very attractive mineral note as well. Fruit is selected from three of Bibi Graetz's favorite vineyards with ancient vines: Lamole (in Chianti Classico), Vincigliata and Siena. Only 5,000 bottles were made. Muscular and concentrated, yet with a sense of elegance derived from vibrant acidity, this red displays black cherry, blackberry, leather, iron and tobacco flavors.

This shows richness with structure. Excellent 2017. Try after 2023. A dry wine firm with dark tannins, this is destined for long aging. Concentration and a solid structure are balanced by the dusty texture and dry core. It will take a while for the potential of the juicy black fruits to come through, so this wine needs to wait until 2024. This reminds me of 2001 more than most wines I've tasted, and perhaps it's no surprise that a vintage that required a skilful touch and a belief in the power of elegance should do well at Haut-Bailly. It's hugely pure and restrained, with great aromatics and extremely well placed bilberry, cassis and mulberry fruits. The tannins are fine and poised, set against cigar box with touches of charcoal and slate. They build through the palate, but remain slightly austere on the finish, with a bounce to them that suggests they are going to age beautifully. They kept the vineyard team for three weeks in July, because the vines kept throwing out green shoots after the June rains. Harvested 13-29 September, the vines were around two weeks ahead all the way through the season. The yield was 28hl/ha overall, but only 2hl/ha on the frosted parts, compared to 40hl/ha for the unaffected areas, 50% of production going into the grand vin. Malo was finished by the end of November, but the vats are still separated and there will be final blend in May 2018 (which is what they always do). 4% of Cabernet Franc finishes the blend given below.\r\n Barrel Sample A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 4% Petit Verdot and 4% Cabernet Franc, the 2017 Chateau Haut-Bailly spent 16 months in 50% new French oak.

With medium body, ripe, polished tannins, beautiful elegance and purity, and a great finish, it's a terrific wine in the vintage that will drink well for 25-30 years. A bold tarry note coils around the core of plum, black currant and blackberry fruit, while licorice root and bramble details check in on the finish.

The wine is sleek, with bosky cherry flavors and a massive structure, needing a day to show its luscious fruit and integrate it into a compact, juicy black sphere. On the third day open, the wine\u2019s restraints are slightly less tense, the flavors hinting at licorice and black cherry with a mellow schist reverb. Beautifully knit, this is the most compelling and ageworthy Croft Vintage yet, under the Fladgate Partnership.

After being opened for some five days, it sealed the deal. It became far more expressive, crisper and transparent. It also became remarkably delicious. It showed not a hint of fading or oxidation. It should age well. On the other side of the coin, you can approach it in several years with some decanting, but giving it about ten to 12 years from vintage date would be far better.

Just when the harvest was getting underway, the weather conditions were finally perfect: blue skies and prolonged north-northeasterly winds. The grapes were riper than anyone dared hope, and had truly outstanding balance. The vines were in perfect health. To the bracing acidity, concision and aromatic purity expected of the 2008 vintage, Dom P\u00e9rignon adds depth, density and complexity. The light is warmer and less harsh. The opening bouquet is complex and luminous, a mingling of white flowers, citrus and stone fruit. The overall effect is enhanced by the freshness of aniseed and crushed mint. The final aromas offered by the wine are starting to show spicy, woody and roasted notes. After a long period of reluctance, the wine is finally opening up. There is complete balance between the nose and the palate. Its slender, minimalist, pure, toned, athletic character is now also expressed with warmth. The fruit is pronounced and clear. The vintage's characteristic acidity is remarkably well integrated. Its persistence is mainly aromatic, grey, smoky and highly promising. The wine enjoys duality: warmth & freshness, meat & iodine pairings, cooked & raw. Spices enhance and accentuate 2008\u2019s effervescence and densify the wine. Dom P\u00e9rignon likes playful experiences: culinary art, textures, and matters.", "reviews": "COMMENTARY: Dom P\u00e9rignon\u2014a luxury brand that needs no introduction\u2014is going to get even better as it moves through the generational changes with the changing of the guard. While this wine has always sparkled in a class by itself since its inception in 1921, the soon-to-be-released 2008 vintage reflects a transition in the winery's Chef de Cave. After nearly three decades as Cellar Master, Richard Geoffroy is turning the reins over to Vincent Chaperon, and the new guy gets to begin his Dom P\u00e9rignon career with one of Champagne's best vintages. I enjoyed the fortune of tasting this wine twice (9/24/18 and 9/26/18). In the first tasting, the wine seemed young and impenetrable. Time aided it, and it opened up spectacularly. Two days later, in a new situation (and a different bottle, of course), the wine seemed to be even more evocative. In both cases, there is no question this is one of the winery's best efforts. I took more than my usual sips\u2014studying a wine of this magnitude sometimes needs patience. TASTING NOTES. This wind deftly exhibits richness and elegance. Its aromas and flavors of bright apples, light chalk, and yeast autolysis come to the fore along with its and persistent, yet delicate palate presence and long finish should pair it superbly with the fresh toro you bring onto your palate. (Tasted: September 26, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The best Dom since 2002. A vintage with very restrained, powerful style that has been released non-sequentially after the 2009. This has a lighter stamp of highly curated, autolytic, toasty aromas than many recent releases. Instead, this delivers super fresh and intense aromas of lemons, grapefruit and blood-orange peel. Incredible freshness here. The palate has a very smoothly delivered, berry-pastry thread with light, sweet spices, stone fruit and fine citrus fruit. This really delivers. Drink now or hold. The 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon is the first time the estate has released a wine out of order (the 2009 was released before the 2008) but the estate loved the wine so much they felt it warranted additional aging. This is a rich, powerful wine that still shows incredible purity and elegance, with a stacked, concentrated feel on the palate. It\u2019s rare to find such a mix of ripe, pure, concentrated fruit paired with this level of purity, focus, and precision. This is a legendary Dom that surpasses all the great vintages of Dom I have experience with, including the 1990, 1996, and 2002. There's power to this graceful Champagne, with the vivid acidity swathed in a fine, creamy mousse and flavors of toasted brioche, kumquat, pastry cream, candied ginger and poached plum that dance across the palate. An underpinning of smoky mineral gains momentum on the lasting finish. Drink now through 2033. The super-fresh nose combines notions of smoky flint, lemon and wet chalk, yet hints at generosity. Minuscule bubbles create immense creaminess on a palate that dances on its light feet and channels freshness into poise. There\u2019s a promise of future richness and depth, always with ozone freshness and lasting length. Drinking Window 2020 - 2035 The 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon continues to show very well, offering up a pretty bouquet of Anjou pear, fresh peach, citrus oil, fresh pastry, smoke and iodine. On the palate, it's full-bodied, lively and incisive, with an elegantly textural attack and a creamy core of fruit that's underpinned by a bright but nicely integrated spine of acidity. The finish is long, saline and well-defined. As I wrote earlier this year, this is the finest Dom P\u00e9rignon since 1996, Richard Geoffroy's push for additional ripeness working well with the late-maturing, high-acid vintage. While it can be appreciated young, the 2008 will really start to blossom with five or six years of bottle age.

That's why he produces his Pinot like red wine, which means high density plantings (10,000 to 12,000 mass selection vines per hectare), short pruning, leaf removal already ten days after the flowering, sorting table, cold maceration with 5-10% of the stems and a very reduced extraction. After ten days, the must is racked and blended with the juice of Chardonnay. \"The idea is to 'acidify' our Pinot Noir, which has a ripe fruit with soft and silky tannin,s but a low acidity,\" explains L\u00e9caillon.

The driving middle weight flavors are blessed with a plentitude of sappy dry extract as well as plenty of minerality on the much more finely textured finish that is both longer and more complex.

Barrel Sample:  91-93 COMMENTARY: The 1er Cru Gevrey-Chambertin Vineyard Champeaux has been responsible for some of Burgundy's finest wines. The 2016 Maume by Domaine Tawse is an outstanding effort. TASTING NOTES: This wine is firmly built and generous with plenty of black fruit aromas and flavors. Pair it with an extra thick grilled lamb chop. (Tasted: March 4, 2019, San Francisco, CA) The 2016 Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Les Champeaux includes around 40% whole bunch this year, picked on 4 October. It has a lovely bouquet with blackcurrant, wild hedgerow, cranberry and wet stone. The palate is medium-bodied with crushed strawberry, blackcurrant, a touch of salted licorice and a tang of orange pith. There is good structure on the finish, not a noble Gevrey-Chambertin, but one with plenty of guts. I expect this to land at the top of my banded score once in bottle.

When the Gaja family decided to stop acquiring fruit from outside growers and bottle only estate-grown grapes, in 1961, it was a bold and difficult move.

Full-bodied and structured with powerful tannins that encase bright and forthright blue fruit, which is polished over by a sheen of glimmering acidity. Long finish. Delicious now, but better in 2022. This is a slightly more subdued vintage of this legendary wine, albeit just as sophisticated as past editions. The 2014 Barolo Sperss opens to gorgeous aromas of dark fruit, wet earth and white truffle. The vineyards in Serralunga d'Alba produced much less fruit than average and suffered from bouts of downy mildew during the rainy seasons. But Serralunga d'Alba fruit is also harvested late, and that extra time was important for achieving grape ripeness targets. The wine presents depth and complexity within the context of a thinner vintage. Having said that, the bouquet is spectacular. Sperss comes from two crus in Serralunga, and like Gaja's Barbarescos it's aged in a combination of barriques and large barrels. As so often is the case, it's a wine that combines power and finesse. It has a subdued cherry nose with a touch of oak, leading to a palate which is rich, powerful and tannic, but not too assertive. It's well balanced and fleshy, with lots of velvety texture and grain, and there's still an underlying freshness and finesse. Very long finish.

Within the Piedra Infinita vineyard they look for the soils that have some 30 to 50 centimeters of soil before getting to the limestone, so the ripening is more harmonious and the palate gains in volume and shows some meat before getting to the chalky, limestone tannins. It really improves with time in the glass and in this vintage it seems to combine elegance with length; there is more texture and, in fact, it feels built around texture and acidity. I think this is a real triumph over the natural conditions of the year. This is what the people who ask what comes after Malbec should get: expression of a place through the grape. Don't look for any smoky or toasty notes here. The effect of the oak is really imperceptible in the aromas. Bravo! 5,000 bottles produced. Bright medium ruby. Superripe aromas of black cherry, cassis, strawberry and crushed stone, plus a hint of tobacco leaf. A juicy, lively midweight with lovely lift to its black raspberry, espresso, spice and stone flavors. This very intense but still-tight wine conveys an impression of firm, mineral-driven acidity. A bit more dusty and herbal than the Paraje Altamira and Gualta Tupungato Alto '14s; perhaps a tad sweeter than the Paraje Altamira but without quite the richness of the Gualta.

It is already drinking beautifully (as most 2014s are) and will continue to evolve nicely for another 12-15+ years. Pure and powerful, with intense red berry and dark cherry flavors that are supported by fresh acidity and firm tannins.

From the Novello township, this vineyard site is recognized for it power, structure and the uniquely broad approach it shows to the palate. There is a larger span of black fruit at its core.

The 2015 Barolo Ravera is once again the head of the class at Vietti. Bright, sculpted and wonderfully nuanced, the Ravera is very pretty. Floral aromatics and the pointed, brilliant fruit that is such a Ravera signature are very much in evidence. Hints of blood orange, mint, crushed rocks and flowers add shades of complexity as the 2015 gradually opens up in the glass. This is one of the finer wines of the year. Don't miss it!

Checking in as a blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, and 7% Cabernet Franc raised in 60% new French oak (the balance was in once-used barrels) and representing a tiny 36% of the production, this deep purple-colored 2016 possesses powerful, incredibly classic Saint-Estephe notes of creme de cassis, graphite, damp earth, lead pencil shavings, and burning embers. With a powerful, full-bodied style on the palate, a huge mid-palate, lots of underlying structure and tannic grip, and perfect balance, this magical wine will need upwards of a decade or cellaring and keep for 40-50 years.

Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2016 Montrose is a little youthfully shy to begin, but with coaxing, it unfurls to reveal the most beguiling scents of wilted roses, oolong tea, crushed rocks, wild sage, star anise and candied violets over a wonderfully pristine, well-defined core of crushed blackcurrants, black raspberries and kirsch plus wafts of pencil lead and wood smoke. The taut, muscular, medium to full-bodied palate straddles jaw-dropping intensity and finesse superbly, featuring a solid backbone of ripe tannins and giving a firm frame right through the incredibly long, exquisitely nuanced finish. The floral and fresh aromas to this are mesmerizing. Roses and lilacs galore. The pure cab aromas coming from the glass \u2013 blackcurrants and blackberries \u2013 are so memorable. Full-bodied, deep and profound. The ultra-fine tannins on the palate are so polished and fine-grained. The finish goes on for minutes with subtle yet superb fruit. It\u2019s all about precision and form here. A modern classic for Montrose. Better after 2026. A stunning dark-fruited wine, one of the best from the vintage. Just about everything you\u2019d want in a great Montrose: a perfumed nose of violets and blackcurrants, pure fruit with a salty mineral savour, concentration and a velvety texture, but also lift, freshness and finesse.

The palate has quite dense and smoothly rendered, ripe tannins that deliver a long, composed and approachable Barolo. Drink or hold. The Barolo Brunate was not made in 2014 because of hail damage. Instead, all the fruit was diverted to the Langhe Nebbiolo Perbacco instead. This newest release, the 2015 Barolo Brunate, definitely makes up for the lost ground. This is an explosive and absolutely exuberant expression of Nebbiolo from a vineyard site in La Morra near M. Marengo\u2019s property. Vietti farms two parcels here, a higher side of the vineyard and a lower one (near Damilano and Ceretto). These lower parts of Brunate perform very nicely in the cooler vintages. Instead, this warm vintage expression puts a lot of its fruit depth and personality upfront in a confident and no-fuss manner. You absolutely know what you are getting here, even at the first sniff of the bouquet. The wine proceeds to open and blossom before your nose, offering dark fruit, rose, spice and a very linear mineral tone at the back. That linear flinty note is just terrific. Luca Currado\u2019s 2015 Brunate is a large-scaled wine with dark flavors of plump berries layered in notes of anise, licorice and tobacco. It feels crisp and precise, lifted by scents of rose and violets and infused with brisk acidity that balances the wine\u2019s robust alcohol (15 percent).\u00a0 This savory red delivers balsamic aromas and flavors of wild rosemary, juniper, eucalyptus and tobacco, revolving around a core of cherry, strawberry, graphite and licorice notes. Firm and sinewy on the finish, with an aftertaste of ripe, sweet fruit. Excellent length.

Rating: 94+ Checking in as a blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Merlot that was brought up in 60% new French oak, the 2017 Chateau Pape Clement is going to check in behind the brilliant 2015 and 2016, but it's nevertheless a brilliant wine from this estate worth having in the cellar. Great notes of blackcurrants, smoked tobacco, gravelly earth, mocha, and hints of licorice all flow to a medium to full-bodied wine that has remarkable purity of fruit as well as polished tannins. It builds nicely with time in the glass and reminds me of a toned-down version of the 2016. This complex, elegant, flawlessly balanced Pessac can be drunk today with incredible pleasure or cellared for 15-20 years. I have found that Magrez estates have done exceptionally well in 2017, pretty much across the board, but here I feel a reach towards the barrel that is just the slightest bit out of step with the ripeness of the fruit. The tannins are flexible and in control, but it just lacks a touch of the opulence in the black fruits that was so abundant in 2015 and 2016.

TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits loads of complex and more-than-fruit character. Enjoy its alluring aromas and flavors of savory spices, ripe fruit, and earth with a wild mix of game birds, Morels, and Portobellos. (Tasted: October 28, 2019, San Francisco, CA) The 2017 Chardonnay Bentrock Vineyard gives up gregarious, mineral-driven layers of ripe quince, white peach, apple pie, lemon cream and accents of nutmeg, chalk and river stone. It's light to medium-bodied with intense, nuanced fruits wound up with tangy acidity and finishing long, layered and textured. Yes! Racines is brand-new joint venture between Justin WIllett of Tyler, Etienne de Montille from Burgundy, and Rodolphe Peters of the eponymous champagne house. It's a negociant producer, buying grapes from top vineyards in the Santa Rita Hills area of Santa Barbara County. Bentrock enjoys a high windy elevation. The wines tasted so far show a bit more exuberance than the restrained Tyler style. This Chardonnay displays a ripe but stony nose, with pungent lemony aromas. A good attack leads to a rich and weighty palate that's textured without being heavy.

This wine opens up with delightful and distinctive aromas of red to black fruits, a dusting of cocoa powder to capture me under its spell. Its palate is layered and superbly structured. The sweet tannins keep it all together before its crescendo of a long, lasting, and memorable finish. (Tasted: October 30, 2017, San Francisco, CA) This remarkable wine from the famed familyfarmed,\r\norganic estate impresses immediately in its depth of concentration and stately grace, imparting a wealth of rose-garden compost and wild truffle on the nose.

Whereas 2016 had a very mild winter and exceptionally hot summer, this was compensated by abundant winter and spring rainfall. Conversely, 2017 was warm and dry throughout, although summer temperatures were closer to average, which proved to be a very significant factor allowing for complete, balanced ripening. It is rare to see such tremendous depth and intensity in color as this wine displays. The freshness of the floral aromas is very attractive with a dominance of rockrose, a flower that grows wild around the hills of Senhorada Ribeira. On the palate, it is exceptionally full-bodied, rich and powerful with black fruit coming to the fore. Gorgeous, ripe fruit is balanced by the fine tannin structure.

Full-bodied, medium sweet with fine-grained tannins that coat your palate. Powerful and muscular yet remains agile and beautiful. Grows on your palate. Wonderful ripe fruit in the middle palate.

Based on fruit from the predominantly south-facing Quinta do Bomfim in the Cima Corgo and Quinta Senhora da Ribeira in the Douro Superior, with Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca making up 80% of the blend. This is opaque and closed in but powerfully ripe with underlying pure berry fruit. It's seemingly quite introverted compared to some of its peers at this stage, but it's still full, rich and opulent on the palate. It also shows the latent power of the vintage, made as it is in a slightly drier style (3.4 Baum\u00e9), with lovely minty fruit and full, ripe sinewy tannins all the way through the finish. Long and lithe, and very fine. A dense, thickly textured version, dripping with warm salted licorice, tar and\r\na\u00e7a\u00ed paste notes, while plum and blueberry p\u00e2te de fruit, chai spice and\r\nchocolate elements fill in behind.

It was bottled about a month before this tasting after 18 months in seasoned vats, but the just-bottled sample was not actually used for fear it might be in shock. This, accordingly, was actually a pre-bottling sample. It comes in with 106 grams of residual sugar.  Barrel Sample: 94-96 This is a dry while also floral wine, perfumed and enticing with its juicy acidity. At the same time, the structure is very present, showing power and dark black fruits. The balance is coming together with the rich fruits and tannins melding into one. Drink from 2028. This 2017 has all the markers of a legendary Taylor Port\u2014scents of green fig, the complex tannic impact of schist, the consternating sense of elegance in the face of massive structural power. David Guimaraens bases this wine on fruit from the Quinta de Vargellas, an estate on the south bank of the river in the arid Douro Superior. In our tastings, it came after several 2017s that were sourced from vineyards on the north bank, closer to Pinh\u00e3o, and, while it would be simplistic to consider this a definitive difference (there are many exposures in each quinta, and other quinta parcels in the blends), there was a stark shift from the blackness of those wines to the sour-cherry impression of this wine, and its floral fraise des bois notes.

Here, lime-rich subsoils, southwest exposure, and ventilation arriving from the Tyrrhenian sea to the west deliver well-balanced Brunello di Montalcino, defined by its characteristic red fruit notes, minerality, and polished tannin.", "reviews": "The 2013 Brunello di Montalcino Rennina is a dark, plush and succulent red wine with seamless overall integration. Angelo Gaja makes his wines with broad brush strokes that form shapes of perfect harmony and grandeur. He seems less interested in the minutiae, much in the same way an impressionist painter creates a portrait without consideration for the gritty details of reality. Continuing with my art metaphor, I'll venture to say that this is a big-picture wine that embraces bold fruit, oak spice, acidity and tannin in one overwhelming and warm embrace. I usually score the Sugarille a point or two higher, but this year the Rennina won my heart. This perfumed Brunello offers enticing scents of pressed violet, rose, talcum powder, wild berry, eucalyptus and a whiff of exotic spice. On the structured palate, firm fine-grained tannins provide support for dried black cherry, licorice, vanilla and a hint of espresso. Drink from 2023 through 2033. Aromas of orange peel, dark fruit and bark. Dried mushroom, too. Full body and extremely polished and velvety tannins that are plush but compacted. Delicious finish. Drink in 2021. This is fragrant, offering cherry, leather, floral and spice notes. On the palate, this remains fresh, with persistent flavors and fine harmony. Dusty tannins pull everything together on the finish. There\u2019s plenty of energy here. Best from 2021 through 2035. The 2013 Rennina comes three separate vineyards (ferment and macerate separately for around three weeks) and is brought up in a mix of barrel and concrete tanks. It's a ripe, sexy Brunello that doesn't pull any punches with its kirsch, dried earth, spice-box, and licorice aromas and flavors. Ripe, medium to full-bodied, and downright flambouyant, it still has good acidity, a balanced, layered textured, ripe tannins, and a great finish.

Full-bodied, tight and reserved. The tannins are so tightly knit and just run through the center. Needs at least three or four years to open. A blend of 77% merlot and 23% cabernet franc. Better after 2023. Dark and dense, this is a massive wine. Big tannins are paralleled by concentrated blackberry fruits to give a wine that is both juicy and impressively rich. Structure and power are likely to be tamed as the wine ages. Drink from 2024. Canon remains pretty austere at this stage with the Cabernet Franc dominating. It's not as immediately seductive as some years, but you can feel the bedding down of the tannins, restraining the elegance and floral minerality but not hiding it completely. Sit with it in the glass and you start to feel a wine that rises above the vintage.

The 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon Cask 23 Estate-Grown is a big-time winner with great fruit, terrific texture, full body, sensational purity and plenty of blue and black fruits interwoven. The amazing thing about all of these wines is that no oak shows through whatsoever, although I suspect the percentage of new oak is relatively high. That\u2019s an example of the extravagance and richness of the fruit that the winery is achieving. Again, purity, harmony, complexity and individuality are hallmarks of these wines. Drink this 2014 Cask 23 over the next 25 years.\r\n\r\n Barrel Sample:  94-96 Winemaker Marcus Notaro blends this wine from two adjacent estate-owned vineyards farmed by Kirk Grace. Fay, with its alluvial soils, provides 44 percent of the blend in 2014; the balance comes from S.L.V., where the vines rise higher up the eastern bench of Stag\u2019s Leap, rooted in the crush of volcanic rock that has washed down off the palisades. They combine in a cabernet with cool richness, layering fruit notes of chocolate and wild mushrooms with a rush of satiny fruit tannins. There are no barriers to obscure the wine\u2019s youthful integration or its complexity, still incipient, but there in the breath for minutes, compellingly fresh and satiating in its savor. Glorious aromas of blacberries and blackcurrants follow through to a full body, ultra-fine tannins and an alluring finish. It shows such polish and verve. Try it in 2020, but it's already a show to taste. Shows the pedigree. A 100% varietal and estate-grown wine from the site made\r\nfamous in the Paris Tasting, this offers yeasty brioche aromas that lead to crisp expansive flavors of cassis and red currant. The oak is supportive and integrated, adding to the wine\u2019s overall earthiness of dried herb and clove, lasting and juicy on the finish.\r\n Editors' Choice Deftly balanced, creamy and smooth-textured, with an elegant array of red and dark berry, anise, cedar and mocha flavors, ending with fine-grained tannins and a splash of mocha.

The wine offers a very clear, precise, fresh, intense and really distinctive bouquet with aromas of stewed quinces and lemons. On the palate, this is a highly delicate and perfectly balanced TBA with great finesse and purity (despite its high concentration). The acidity is very fine and persistently salty, and if there are any tannins, these are very fine too. A great elegant, finessed, beautifully balanced TBA. Ripeness came easily in 2015, a hot year, and the botrytis was abundant and clean. Kracher made a dozen sweet wines that vintage, including his flagship, Nummer 6. It\u2019s a blend of chardonnay and welschriesling, two varieties that have been growing in the region since the 12th century. And it\u2019s insanely sweet, with 238.8 grams per liter of residual sugar. But once the sugar-shock wears off, a calm warmth floods the palate, a plush, humid texture carrying notes of pineapple, orange and sweet pumpkin preserves. It feels like sunshine in liquid form, a radiant wine to serve alone or with an apricot tart. Silky and fresh-tasting for a dessert wine, with well-cut minerality through the notes of white raisin, dried pineapple and papaya. Features a long, well-defined finish.

The blend is roughly 52 percent Merlot, 34 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 10 percent Cabernet franc, 2 percent Malbec, and 2 percent Petit verdot. The fruit was fermented at low temperatures in small, open-top tanks and punched down by hand one to three times per day, depending on how the wine tasted during the fermentations. Maceration was 18-24 days. The wine was partially co-fermented (fermented together as one lot), and the remainder racked and blended before malolactic fermentation, so that the wine could marry from the very beginning\u2014much magic happens during fermentation, and co-fermenting can create a seamless wine in a way that doesn\u2019t always happen with blending after the fact.

From one of the most prestigious Champagne houses, this wine is consistently a top performer. Creamy, complex, and exotic, it is a perfect choice with the grandest of meals.

Round, wide and very elegant yet also straight and tense on the palate, this 2010-dominated cuv\u00e9e is very delicate, fresh and chalky but also dense and lush in its vinous texture. The finish is well-structured, fresh and persistent, indicating great complexity and vibrancy. However, I would wait at least another three years, during which time the 166th edition will gain even more finesse and quiet.

Like no other Champagne.\r\n \r\n  Rating: 95+ \r\n This mouthwatering Champagne feels like a swathe of raw silk on the palate, where flavors of sun-dried white cherry, toast and Meyer lemon peel are accented by expressive saffron, ground coffee and mandarin orange peel aromas. Long and racy on the honey-, spice- and smoke-laced finish. Disgorged winter 2017. Drink now through 2025. As its name indicates, this is the 167th blend of this producer\u2019s famed Grande Cuv\u00e9e. Based upon an enviable range of reserve wines, the blend has maturity that is just right, balancing fruit as well as the toast. It is rich and ready to drink. As grand as its name would suggest, this is a complex and substantial blend, based on the 2011 vintage. Eric Lebel included reserve wines going back to 1995, providing 42 percent of the final blend. In the mix of 191 individual lots, there\u2019s a lot of flavor complexity, layering hazelnut, white flowers, exotic fruit, hints of butterscotch and toast. There\u2019s also an earthy, meaty tone, like mousse truff\u00e9, which is what you might serve with it. Non-vintaged though it may be, this wine has in the past shown as one of the older cuvees in our tastings, and so again does it do so here. This time, as one expects of Krug, the aged, toasty, minerally character is accompanied by bright, acid-braced, still evident fruit.

The Baricci 2015 Brunello di Montalcino is highly distinguished by its mineral side (with marl, marine fossil, schist quartz and Galestro soils), and that is truly the magic of this wine. There is a pungent note of raw grape at first, but it lifts to reveal forest berry, camphor ash and subtle touches of sweet spice. These elements come together like a tightly fitted mosaic. The wine is balanced and fresh, with just enough structure to add firmness and considerable length to its polished mid-weight frame. In fact, mouthfeel is this wine's strongest suit. Acidity is never a problem in Montosoli, located on the north side of Montalcino where day and night temperature shifts play an important role in slow fruit ripening. This warm vintage shows higher extract, but the overall balance allowed Baricci to bottle using very little sulfur (which could account for that little tangy note you get on first nose). All 5ha of Baracci's vines are contained in one single vineyard on the hill of Montosoli. With a southeastern exposure, the vineyards are cooled by breezes from the north and east and the soils are a complex mix of marl, schist and quartz. The 2015 is effortlessly balanced, starting with suitably mellowed but still radiant aromas of fennel blossom, tobacco and crushed stone. It flows smoothly on the palate, demonstrating its cunning power with well-honed tannins. For now, underlying tasty red cherry is highly gratifying but this will express so much more in years to come.

Yet, it\u2019s more refined than in past vintages. One of the more balanced bottlings from this winery. Delicious already. Available in 2020. Better after 2021. The only wine produced here is the 2015 Pintia, which, in the warm and dry 2015, reaches 15% alcohol and has moderate acidity and a creamy, soft texture, with plenty of concentration, ripeness and tannins. It fermented in oak vats and matured in oak barrels (new and used, French and American) for 12 months. It was a powerful vintage, and they did part of the malolactic fermentation in oak vats instead of 100% in barrique to keep some of the freshness, and they also have 15,000 liters of wine that can mature in stainless steel and rotate some lots in vat before they are put in barrique. All this goes in the direction of keeping the freshness of the wine in a zone where power comes naturally, and all the tools are welcomed, including the use of different toast in the barrels. All this seems to have paid off, and even if the wine is powerful and tannic, it has good balance and the tannins are fine-grained.

Finishing at 14.6% alcohol, this wine (generally a blend of about 60% Cabernet Franc and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon) has incredibly gorgeous aromatics of black and blue fruits, forest floor, violets, and an almost Graves-like, scorched earth, gravelly nuance. The wine hits the palate with a full-bodied richness and terrific harmony among its structural elements such as alcohol, acidity, tannin and wood, with moderately sweet tannins in the finish. It is a good 30- to 35-year wine, as most Mayas have tended to be, and is impressive and surprisingly structured for a 2014. Forget it for 3-4 years and drink it over the following 35-40 years.\r\n  Rating: 95+ The 2014 Maya is powerful, compact and closed in on itself. That's not much of a surprise given the wine was just bottled a few months ago. Dark, powerful and intense, the 2014 offers plenty of energy, but is also holding back much of its potential at this stage. The blend is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Cabernet Franc, which is to say more Cabernet than has been the norm in recent years. There is plenty of intensity to the pomegranate, plum, red cherry and blood orange flavors, but the wine needs time to come into its own.\r\n95+ Very tight and complex, in a reined-in style that isn't showing much now except potential.

Brought up in new barrels, it offers stunning notes of pure creme de cassis, unsmoked tobacco, lead pencil, and crushed rocks. Showing a touch of spring flowers with air, full-bodied richness and depth, awesome tannin quality, and a laser-like level of precision and purity, it\u2019s going to need a decade of cellaring yet will have 40-50 years of prime drinking. Hats off to proprietor Bruno Borie for another magical wine. While the dense and dark tannins are prominent, they can\u2019t mask the exuberant fruit that wants to burst out. Blackberry flavors are impressively ripe and rich, shot through with acidity that gives the wine salinity as well as freshness. At the back, those tannins will allow the wine to age over many years. Don\u2019t drink before 2024. Deep ruby in colour, the tannins are confident and there is a good building of layers and power despite the still-evident austerity. As it opens up, you get cigar box, vanilla bean, liquorice, black chocolate and layers of gourmet flavours after a carafe (we tried it with and without). No need to worry too much about that, as you're not going to want to be drinking this yet but it gives a good indication of the fact that this is going to progress well and steadily, and is an excellent example of the vintage. Bottled in July. It will be ready significantly before the 2016 but probably after the 2015. This has clear tension and a sense of purity to the fruit flavours. 100% new oak. Deep purple-black in color, the 2017 Ducru-Beaucaillou slowly unfurls to reveal beautifully fragrant notes of warm kirsch, wild blueberries, fresh red and black currants and violets with wafts of underbrush and Earl Grey tea. Medium-bodied, the palate has great freshness and elegance, with very well-played, plush tannins and bags of perfumed fruit, finishing on a lingering spicy note.

Editors\u2019 Choice COMMENTARY: The 2016 Spottswoode Lyndenhurst Cabernet Sauvignon is a beautifully balanced and elegant wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine is authentic with its aromas and flavors of red and black fruits. It's dry, well-built, yet soft touch on the palate makes a superb candidate with a well-seasoned Porchetta. (Tasted: July 14, 2019, San Francisco, CA) I loved the 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon Lyndenhurst, a classy wine that shows the style of this great estate perfectly as well as the quality of the vintage. Lots of pure cassis fruits along with touches of violets and tobacco give way to a medium-bodied, ethereal, elegant wine that has terrific purity, balance, and length. It will evolve gracefully for 15 years or more. Aron Weinkauf blends this wine from both estate-grown and purchased fruit, mostly from St. Helena, with a contribution from Atlas Peak. The tannins lend allspice and mixed peppercorn notes to the wine\u2019s warm black-currant flavors, creating a gentle cabernet. There\u2019s some crunchy red fruit in the middle that may lengthen out with bottle age.

This shows richness with structure. Excellent 2017. Try after 2023. A dry wine firm with dark tannins, this is destined for long aging. Concentration and a solid structure are balanced by the dusty texture and dry core. It will take a while for the potential of the juicy black fruits to come through, so this wine needs to wait until 2024. This reminds me of 2001 more than most wines I've tasted, and perhaps it's no surprise that a vintage that required a skilful touch and a belief in the power of elegance should do well at Haut-Bailly. It's hugely pure and restrained, with great aromatics and extremely well placed bilberry, cassis and mulberry fruits. The tannins are fine and poised, set against cigar box with touches of charcoal and slate. They build through the palate, but remain slightly austere on the finish, with a bounce to them that suggests they are going to age beautifully. They kept the vineyard team for three weeks in July, because the vines kept throwing out green shoots after the June rains. Harvested 13-29 September, the vines were around two weeks ahead all the way through the season. The yield was 28hl/ha overall, but only 2hl/ha on the frosted parts, compared to 40hl/ha for the unaffected areas, 50% of production going into the grand vin.

With medium body, ripe, polished tannins, beautiful elegance and purity, and a great finish, it's a terrific wine in the vintage that will drink well for 25-30 years. A bold tarry note coils around the core of plum, black currant and blackberry fruit, while licorice root and bramble details check in on the finish.

Balasto is a rich wine in 2016, with bright blueberry concentration to its fruit flavors, and smoky, meaty char to its oak. Youthfully tannic, it needs a few years of bottle age to mellow.

It was aged for 20 months in second use, untoasted French foudres and comes in at 14.5% alcohol. This is not as big or as rich as the 2015, but it seems better balanced and more focused, if not quite as attention-getting. The restraint helps this along and makes it seem like a fine food wine. Granting that they were not tasted from the same bottle size (and are certainly not at the same stage of development), this seems to me to be slightly better than the 2015.

The tannins push their way right through the palate, but cradle the cassis and bilberry fruit rather than smother it, helped by the fact that floral and smoky aromatics rise up. There's good persistency and you get that little kick and dance of minerality. The precision engineering is clear, but the overall feeling is simply of cohesion and enjoyment. 3.65ph. 100% new oak, but without a trace even now at this early stage. Approximately 60% of the wine this year came from the gravelly plots which were less affected by the frost, which accounts for a slightly higher level of Cabernet Sauvignon than usual. They used perhaps 1% of secondary budding in this blend (five weeks behind schedule at bud-break and then around 15 days by harvest) and kept picking from 15 September to 11 October - an extremely long schedule compared to most estates in 2017. With around 30% loss to frost, there will be 50,000 bottles of Cheval in 2017, compared to 116,000 in 2016. 21hl/ha yield this year, 75% destined for the grand vin.\r\n Barrel Sample Singed tobacco leaf and savory aromas lead the way, giving this red a distinctive profile, while dark currant, fig and blackberry paste flavors form the core.

Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Best from 2024 through 2042. With an unusually high percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, this vintage presents a structured character. It is a straight wine, in line with dark tannins and black-currant fruits lightened by the jammy Merlot berry flavors. Drink this wine from 2024 Very oaky spicy and cocoa dust oaky aromas. Floral, violet and leafy. Black fruit, Inviting in a classic style. Lean fruit, some greenness. Rich cassis and black plum fruit flavours. Spicy oak, and dry tannins. Fresh dry finish.

Best from 2024 through 2040.\u00a0 This is a very charming Pauillac with texture, rippling energy and undoubted finesse. It's deceptive, because the dark, luscious blackberry, bilberry, and damson notes are fairly fresh, with a luscious lipsmacking quality, but the tannins build over the palate. It almost tastes like a St-Julien rather than a Pauillac as they're so fine and elegant, but the Pauillac character becomes more apparent by the close of play - there's no hiding those swirling cassis, smoke and menthol notes.

My notes on this incredible wine are laced with expletives that I, unfortunately, can\u2019t repeat here. Safe to say, however, it\u2019s one of the greatest young Bordeaux I\u2019ve been lucky enough to taste.

Barrel Sample : 98-100 2018 is another vintage where it's pretty much impossible to find fault with Las Cases, and where you get a kick of happiness from tasting it. Owner Jean-Hubert Delon compares the 2016 to the 1961 and the 2018 to the 1959 - let's all check back in a few decades to see if that's true!\r\n \r\nBut where the 2016 was monumental, this has a subtlety that's rarely seen in such a young LLC. It's not that you'd call this approachable but you rarely see this level of plush density to the fruit at this stage. There's a civilised quality to the structure that makes you think, just maybe, the 2018 will be at optimum drinking before the 2016. You're still getting the complex cigar box and cassis aromatics, with deep, rippling black fruits on the palate accompanied by a cassis and liquorice whoosh and the layering up of dense but fine tannins. It demonstrates precise balance and an exceptionally long finish. All in all, this is a standout St-Julien.\r\n \r\nThis year sees the lowest percentage of press wine ever used at this estate, coming in at under 3% (it's normally double this), because the wine already had so much structure that the normal level of press wine threw it out of balance. I'm pretty sure that I've never given a drinking window this early for LLC at En Primeur, which says something. 90% new oak. \r\n  Barrel Sample:  98 It is the tannins that mark out this powerful wine, presenting a fine balancing act between a firm structure and rich dark fruit flavors.

The full-bodied palate is built like a brick house with a solid frame of super firm, super ripe tannins and seamless freshness to back up the vibrant, crunchy, oh-so-muscular fruit, finishing long with loads of mineral layers.

On the palate, the 2018 is dark and sumptuous, with striking aromatic presence and silky tannins that wrap around a rich core of exotic fruit. Black cherry, savory herbs, leather, spice and menthol build in the glass in a wine that is both aromatically intense and richly textured. The 2018 has been nothing short of breathtaking on the two occasions I have tasted it so far. Don't miss it.\r\n\r\n Barrel Sample:  97-100 The beautiful integration of ripe fruit and ripe tannins gives the wine a layered and agile mouthfeel.

This is as classy as it gets and certainly a candidate for the King of Saint-Est\u00e8phe in 2018. Given its purity and balance as well as depth of fruit, it should offer loads of pleasure in its youth yet also evolve nicely for 3-4 decades.

It stretches out through the palate and you keep waiting for the tannins to punch through like they did in 2010, but it doesn't happen, even though this is a big wine with high alcohol and an IPT of 80.

It has the luxurious signature of Cos, the glamorous touch that you look for in this wine - like at Mouton and at Angelus - that is part of their DNA, but it's also married to elegance and a touch of slate minerality. This is a wine that you would be thrilled to own. 12mm of rain on 12 September and 20mm in mid-August were just enough to stop any blockages in ripening, although the 30hl/ha yield is low due to a touch of mildew and some concentration in September. This compares to a more generous 45hl/ha in 2016. 65% of production went into the grand vin. 1% Petit Verdot makes up the blend, and the wine is aged in 50% new oak (a little lower than the usual 60%).

The bubbles are fine, the very essence of Salon 2007 in all its dynamic luminous energy. In the glass, aromas form a moving backdrop, fresh and bright as sunrise, with notes of lemon, lime, yuzu, then green apple, a hint of smoked tea and fresh herbs on wet stone. The palate is focused on backbone and purity; this is the terroir of Le Mesnil taking center stage, displaying its unique rigor and stony imprint. An electric sensation, sending shiver upon shiver down the spine.

Such an impressive wine for the detail in every respect. The nose delivers fresh lemon and grapefruit peel, together with white, stony minerals and very, very fresh and light pastry notes. Some grilled hazelnuts, too. The palate is super fine, supple and crisp with attractive, dry, salty minerals on the finish that holds super long, fine and focused. Elegant citrus and light brioche to close. Drink or hold. There are pure chalk and lemon juice notes intertwined with perfectly ripe, sunny white and yellow-fleshed fruit expressions (even hints of pineapples) on the bright, fresh, subtle but most of all highly elegant and nobly expressive nose. Altogether, that makes the 2007 Blanc de Blancs Le Mesnil Brut an outstanding Salon that already shows its class without any reservation but also without any compromises to its refined and terroir-driven style. Compared to the powerful and structured 2006 that, from my memories, showed wet chalk flavors but almost no fruit in its youth, the weightless and delicate 2007 is a coolish, elegant and smoky gentleman dressed in a white tie and silk hat\u2014Max Raabe singing Berlin chansons from the 1920s! The performance on the palate is pure yet concentrated, fresh and linear, very elegant and perfectly balanced, but most of all, it is extremely fine and stimulating! There is a chalky-dusty texture in the aftertaste that makes this a great Salon with sublime finesse and elegance. Lovely lemon flavors are displayed on the pure, fresh and concentrated finish. The radiant 2007 Salon is one of the greatest champagnes I have had from this vintage. While there aren\u2019t a lot of brilliant wines from the 2007 vintage in Champagne, the unusual parameters that define Salon produced a wine that could well be considered a classic. It\u2019s made only from chardonnay grown in Le Mesnil, and the vintage turned out a wine of clarity and purity. A grand and generous chardonnay, this opens from a tight place into broad hazelnut flavors and elusive smokiness, even as it maintains its focus and precision. Lasting and delicious to drink now, it will only benefit from several years of cellar time. COMMENTARY: I am the first to admit that Salon has touched all of my living and imaginary senses. Over the years, I have enjoyed many vintages from this incredible producer. The 2007 vintage is elegant as always. TASTING NOTES: This wine is bright, zippy, minerally, and scintillating. Pair its well-focused aromas and flavors of green apple and chalk with a dozen or two raw oysters. (Tasted: September 24, 2018, San Francisco, CA) A fresh and elegant Champagne, with a light, pleasing plushness to the\r\nmousse.

Great depth and structure, the power married to cool freshness that gives this great vitality. Enormously long and complex finish. Try to wait until at least 2023. The 2017 Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru has turned out very well indeed, wafting from the glass with a lovely bouquet of dark wild berries, smoked meats, incense, spices and dark chocolate that's framed by a lavish but nicely integrated application of high-quality new oak. On the palate, it's full-bodied, deep and velvety, with a layered and impressively concentrated core, melting tannins and a long, sapid finish. It's one of the highlights of Faiveley's red portfolio this year, punching above its weight in the usual hierarchy. This is a distinctly serious Clos de Vougeot from the Faiveleys, sourced from three parcels in the Clos, two high and one lower, adding up to 1.3ha. It's rich, dense and showing what technical director,J\u00e9r\u00f4me Flous calls 'attractive rusticity', a sensitively oaked wine that's spicy and well balanced. Here too the wood treatment is less than subtle though on the ripe and fresh earth-inflected aromas of wild red and dark berries, violet and a hint of leather. There is better volume to the rich and well-muscled flavors that possess better mid-palate concentration if less refinement, all wrapped in a youthfully austere and impressively persistent if rustic finish. I like the complexity and overall, there is just a bit more here.  Barrel Sample:  91-94 A sleek red, with well-defined cherry, floral, spice and earth notes aligned to a firm structure.

Firm yet well-integrated tannins frame a core of dark red berries, flowers, mint, spices and licorice. The Reserve shows lovely inner perfume and mid-palate juiciness. It should drink well with a minimum of cellaring. The main vineyards in the 2009 are Home (37%), Lampyridae (23%), Vogt (14%), Chabot (11%) and Rancho del Oso (9%). Each lot was aged separately for about two years before the final blend was assembled. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2029.

Composed this year almost entirely of Cabernet Sauvignon, offers a sweeter, rounder nose than one might find in other vintages, which is a testament to the seamless integration of fruit, tannin, and oak. Weighted throughout, the wine\u2019s fragrance and flavors are linear from start to finish, with sophisticated notes of dark berries, black cherries, currants, spice and vanilla flowing together, bringing impressive complexity to this outstanding vintage.", "reviews": "Aromas of blackcurrants, dark chocolate and dried flowers. Very aromatic. Full body, velvety tannins and impressive intensity and richness. Opulent fruit, yet this is still lightly austere and velvety. A beauty every sense of the word. Harmonious, classic wine. In the same ballpark as the 2015, the 2014 Rubicon (97% Cabernet Sauvignon, 2% Merlot and 1% Petit Verdot) is a ripe, full-bodied 2014 that boasts a deep purple color, loads of currants, incense, and cedary spice aromas, terrific mid-palate depth, and building tannin. It can be drunk today or cellared for 15-20 years. The 2014 Rubicon is part of a trajectory of change at Inglenook, begun when Philippe Bascaules arrived in 2011 as estate director. He has worked with viticulturist Enrique Herrera to moderate sun exposure on the grapes and to prune early, in December, so that the bloom and harvest occur earlier in the season. His goal is to avoid excess heat and to ripen the cabernet during August, as he believes early ripening to be more efficient, allowing him to pick fruit without the cooked flavors that might come with longer hang time. He shortened the growing season by ten days between 2012 and 2013, and an additional three days in 2014, selecting the most perfectly ripe grapes for Rubicon. His 2014 may be the finest release yet under his tenure, a classical Rutherford cabernet with sapid red fruit and the kind of deep, umami-rich tannins that Andr\u00e9 Tchelistcheff once described as Rutherford dust. Or maybe they\u2019re a little more gravelly than that. Those distinctive tannins allow the wine to feel elegant and clean while still lending it tensile strength. The proprietary red, the 2014 Rubicon (96% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest Merlot and Petit Verdot) has a saturated black/purple color and a nose of blackberry and cassis with some camphor and charcoal. Chewy, rich and full-bodied, with exceptional precision and personality, this is a stunningly delicious and complex wine with a good 25-30 years of further potential. It is the antithesis of the rustic, somewhat coarse reds that were made under the Rubicon moniker when Francis Ford Coppola first acquired the Inglenook estate. Kudos to him for making dramatic improvements. Approachable already, this wine won\u2019t hit its stride for another decade and will last 30 or more years.  Rating: 95+ Notes of briary plum, blackcurrant, dried herbs, graphite and rich soil introduce an elegant, open-knit and nicely balanced wine with fine tannins, juicy acidity and good length through the finish. This has more depth at the core than the 2013 rendition: a step in the right direction for a terroir which has the potential to produce one of Napa Valley's greatest wines. Tiny amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot were added to this succulent, elegant wine with cassis, cranberry and black cherry flavors and rounded structure. A light note of cocoa dust and soft texture balance its exotically spiced lushness with delicious integration. Loam, sage and smoldering tobacco notes sit atop a core of steeped red and black currant fruit. The finish shows a tarry edge. Once this merges fully, it should provide a character-filled, slightly rustic impression of Cabernet.", "rating": "94.57142857142857", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/inglenook-rubicon-2014/406295"},

Great concentration and incipient complexity; this just needs time. Drinking Window 2024 - 2060 This first-growth estate in St. Helena has produced a 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon that is a blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot.

Full-bodied, concentrated, and impeccably balanced, it lacks the Wow factor of the 2013 and 2015, yet is a classic and textbook as they come.

One of the highlights in this tasting, the 2015 Monte Bello will soon take its place among the greatest Monte Bellos ever made. Powerful, deep and explosive, the 2015 possesses magnificent concentration and richness in every dimension. Even with all of its raciness, the 2015 has terrific aromatic presence and regal tannins. The 2015 is a bit less showy than it has been in the past, but it was also just bottled two weeks before this tasting. Readers who own it will be absolutely thrilled. At this early stage, the 2015 Monte Bello is all about potential. I followed a bottle over several days and only witnessed improvement. The wine unfurls in the glass with a rich bouquet of cassis, ripe plums, espresso roast, black tea and baking chocolate, lavishly framed by minty, spicy new oak\u2014which is often at its most prominent at exactly this stage, when the wine is shutting down after bottling. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with rich, velvety tannins and beautifully succulent, even tangy acidity that lends amazing lift on the finish. The most obvious analogy is the 2005 vintage, though it also evokes a more elegant version of the 1995 Monte Bello. It's a blend of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, 7% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc that attained 13.5% natural alcohol. Since the wine appears to be shutting down, I'd recommend forgetting it until its tenth birthday.

It is \u00a0altogether fascinating, eminently collectable stuff, to be sure, and becomes more interesting yet\u00a0with each successive sip, but it should not be considered for drinking without having had the opportunity to grow into its best, and, with a requisite rest of some six to eight years, it may well\u00a0emerge as its very capable maker\u2019s best effort in recent vintages. One of America\u2019s most iconic wines, this classic mountaintop blend of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, 7% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc opens with aromas of dark berry, black pepper, lilac, baked earth and toasty oak.

Dried flowers, too. Full-bodied, dense and layered. Fantastic richness and depth. Long, long finish. Best ever. With this wine, Canalicchio di Sopra marks its 50th vintage of Brunello. It is a superb tip of the hat to founder Primo Pacenti by his highly capable grandchildren Francesco, Marco and Simonetta Ripaccioli, who now run the property. It expresses gradually and graciously both on the nose and the palate with wild flowers, forest berries and fresh earth emerging out of a sapid and minerally core. Brilliantly mid-weight but not lacking depth, this demonstrates brightness of fruit, delectable acidity, plenty of fine-grained tannins and a lingering finish. This bottle marks the special 50th anniversary of this wine. A little red sticker on the front label commemorates the five decades that have passed since grandfather Primo Pacenti did his first harvest. The medium-weight Canalicchio di Sopra 2015 Brunello di Montalcino shows a generous spread of forest fruit, licorice, blue flower, bay leaf, Provence herbs and fragrant wet soil aromas. There is a touch of earthy muskiness that some like to refer to as \"foxy.\" Fruit for this Brunello represents a selection of clusters harvested over 10 hectares at 300 to 320 meters above sea level in two sites: Canalicchio and Montosoli. Canalicchio has clay soils for the structure of the wine, and Montosoli adds to the clarity of the aromas. All the vines are over 10 years old. Fermentation is in stainless steel, and aging spans 36 months in Slavonian oak casks. This wine from the warm and sunny 2015 vintage maintains its trademark crispness and freshness nonetheless. The 2015 Brunello di Montalcino from Canalicchio di Sopra - Ripaccioli is superb. The nose is dark and mineral-inflected with a blast of crushed raspberry, cherry and darker blackberry fruits wafting up from the glass, as sweet florals, underscored by moist soil and hints of cedar amass. On the palate, silky, almost creamy textures, offset by a stunning mix of salty-minerals and acids with savory herbs, and inner earth tones tempted the senses for another sip. The finish is remarkably long, resonating on minerals and dark fruits, almost balsamic and spicy, as its tannic structure comes forward and reminds me that this Brunello is still just a baby. What a gorgeous expression of Sangiovese. Drinking window: 2024 - 2038.

The super fresh, sour-cherry nose leads you into a very concentrated and focused red with a lot of mineral and graphite character. The tannins are a shade firmer than in the other Grand Crus from Faiveley, but it was always that way. Deep, dark and cool finish that goes on and on. Better from 2023.

Altesino's 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Montosoli shows those celebrated characteristics of this special vineyard cru that are always portrayed with pronounced mineral intensity, with highlights of crushed granite and pencil shaving. Indeed, Altesino's five-hectare Montosoli vineyard sees a greater concentration of clay schist Galestro rock, and the vineyard altitude (at 350 meters above sea level) adds to the wine's perceived freshness. In this case, those mineral notes are applied with small brush strokes, as the core of the wine is occupied by wild fruit and forest berry.

This dramatic Barolo delivers darkness and density. It shows a beautiful appearance with faint highlights of dark ruby that add a subtle sparkle. At this point in its drinking cycle, the wine shows all the characteristic traits of its youth. This means it is more closed and rigid at present. That nervous tightness needs to be factored in when assessing the cellar longevity of this vintage. Hints of the wine\u2019s inner complexity, sheer determination and textural fortitude are already bubbling up from deep inside this firmly layered Nebbiolo. I wanted to mention the tightness of the tannins now. These will undoubtedly serve to carry this wine forward over the coming decades. COMMENTARY: My pals, who casually know me, think that my I spend most of my dining time with Cabernet Sauvignon. What they don't know\u2014like many of my peers\u2014I often reach for the Nebbiolo, which can often reach almost unobtainable heights of greatness. The 2014 Bruno Giacosa Falletto Barolo is an outstanding wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine is omnipotent in so many ways, yet stays refined and classic. Its aromas and flavors reveal a multitude of nuances, including black fruits, leather, earth, and savory spices. Pair it with a spit-roasted leg of lamb accented with rosemary and garlic. (Tasted: March 5, 2019, San Francisco, CA) The picture of elegance, this Barolo is nonetheless steely and solid. Delicate floral, cherry, strawberry and mineral flavors ride the chalky texture, while vibrant acidity and well-proportioned tannins drive the finish.", "rating": "95.0", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/bruno-giacosa-barolo-falletto-2014/422598"},

It offers monumental depth with profound layers of black fruit, coffee, licorice and baking chocolate.

These two editions are very different when compared side to side, and this 2016 release is clearly superior in terms of the quality, clarity and intensity of its offerings. This Ornellaia delivers glossy shine and a polished texture that segues to important richness, concentration and textural fiber. It wraps thickly over the palate, imparting waves of sweet dark fruit and dark spice that linger for many long minutes.

Best from 2025. 2016 is one of the best vintages ever in Bolgheri, classic in style and balanced. It has a 'great sense of the classics without denying the past, a fully-fledged, more modern wine,' according to Axel Heinz. Crimson and dense in colour, it's full of restrained, brambly fresh fruit, clove, nutmeg and a salty butteriness, combined with velvety, masked tannins on the palate. It is at perfect phenolic ripeness, supported by refreshing natural acidity balancing the 14.5% alcohol. This will last for decades. From a great vintage for Bolgheri, the 2016 Ornellaia is a classic blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc, and 4% Petit Verdot that was aged 20 months in 70% new French oak. Its saturated purple color is followed by a deep, beautifully concentrated yet primordial effort that offers serious intensity in its cassis, black cherry, graphite, bay leaf, forest floor, and spring flower aromas and flavors. Full-bodied and multi-dimensional on the palate, it has thrilling purity of fruit, ample tannins, and a great, great finish.

The aromas are reserved, with notes of blackberry, vanilla, spice and cigar box not yet ready to reveal themselves. Full, palate-coating, layered flavors follow, showing a lot of intensity. It packs a big punch, with a warm finish following.

These terroirs are located mainly in the Clos L\u00e9oville Las Cases, which you pass as you leave Saint- Julien village for Pauillac. They extend over nearly 60ha producing Cabernet Sauvignons and Cabernet Francs with a complex, polished expression and characteristics which are totally unique to the Grand Vin of L\u00e9oville du Marquis de Las Cases and have been widely recognized for years. Blend: 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc, 9% Merlot", "reviews": "This is backward and dense, with thickly layered plum, blackberry, fig and blueberry reduction flavors wrapped liberally in warm ganache and melted licorice notes. A long echo of smoldering charcoal emerges at the very end. There's a lot to resolve here as the rich and austere sides are still melding, but the extra amplitude doesn't distort anything; it just all goes to 11.\r\n  Barrel Sample:  97-100 \u201cWe produced great Cabernet Franc this year,\u201d Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Pierre Graffeuille told me during my visit to L\u00e9oville Las Cases. Even though only 3% of the press wine was added back, he was also absolutely glowing about the quality of this too. And he should be\u2014the finished blend for the 2018 L\u00e9oville Las Cases is yet another triumph for this great estate. Composed of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, harvested September 15 to October 4 with yields of 35.5 hectoliters per hectare, it has 14.49% alcohol and will be aged in barriques, 90% new. Very deep purple-black in color, it is a little closed to begin, slowly emerging from the glass to reveal subtle woodsmoke, violets, tilled soil and underbrush scents over a core of warm cassis, wild blueberries and redcurrant jelly plus hints of rare beef and iron ore. Full-bodied, rich, super concentrated and bursting with latent energy, this is an atomic bomb waiting to go off in your mouth. It has a rock-solid foundation of firm, very ripe, very finely grained tannins and bold freshness supporting the muscular fruit through the epically long, amazingly nuanced finish. Simply breathtaking.  Barrel Sample:  98-100 OMG. This shows amazing depth of fruit and density. Full-bodied and so layered with incredible fruit and power. Blackberries. Blueberries. Violets. Hints of dried flowers. Fantastic fruit and tannins, yet agile and energetic. The ch\u00e2teau says 2016 plus, plus.\r\n  Barrel Sample:  99-100 A candidate for the wine of the vintage is the 2018 L\u00e9oville Las Cases. My notes on this incredible wine are laced with expletives that I, unfortunately, can\u2019t repeat here. Safe to say, however, it\u2019s one of the greatest young Bordeaux I\u2019ve been lucky enough to taste. Based on a blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, and 9% Cabernet Franc, from yields of 35.5 hectoliters per hectare, that will spend 19 months in barrel, it offers a massive bouquet of cr\u00e8me de cassis, lead pencil shavings, crushed violets, tobacco, and a liquid rock-like minerality. Pure magic on the palate as well, with full-bodied richness, building structure, and a seamless, weightless, yet powerful mouthfeel, it has everything you could want from a wine. It has the purity and balance to drink well in 7-8 years (I wouldn\u2019t hold it against you if couldn\u2019t wait that long) and will keep for 50 years or more. For the tech geeks out there, this hit 14.49% alcohol.  Barrel Sample : 98-100 It is the tannins that mark out this powerful wine, presenting a fine balancing act between a firm structure and rich dark fruit flavors. It is the epitome of elegant Saint-Julien, with a welcome mix of weight and freshness.\r\n  Barrel Sample: 96-98 2018 is another vintage where it's pretty much impossible to find fault with Las Cases, and where you get a kick of happiness from tasting it. Owner Jean-Hubert Delon compares the 2016 to the 1961 and the 2018 to the 1959 - let's all check back in a few decades to see if that's true!\r\n \r\nBut where the 2016 was monumental, this has a subtlety that's rarely seen in such a young LLC. It's not that you'd call this approachable but you rarely see this level of plush density to the fruit at this stage. There's a civilised quality to the structure that makes you think, just maybe, the 2018 will be at optimum drinking before the 2016. You're still getting the complex cigar box and cassis aromatics, with deep, rippling black fruits on the palate accompanied by a cassis and liquorice whoosh and the layering up of dense but fine tannins. It demonstrates precise balance and an exceptionally long finish. All in all, this is a standout St-Julien.\r\n \r\nThis year sees the lowest percentage of press wine ever used at this estate, coming in at under 3% (it's normally double this), because the wine already had so much structure that the normal level of press wine threw it out of balance. I'm pretty sure that I've never given a drinking window this early for LLC at En Primeur, which says something. 90% new oak. \r\n  Barrel Sample:  98", "rating": "99.33333333333333", "url": "https://www.wine.com/product/chateau-leoville-las-cases-6-pack-owc-futures-pre-sale-2018/529316"},

Balanced and tightly framed on the medium-to full-bodied palate with mouthwatering fruit and crunchy acidity, coloring an ornately woven structure of silky tannins. Very long and velvety on the finish. Everything is where it should be. Drink from 2025. One of the first things I notice in the 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Altero is the increased richness or concentration (especially compared to the estate's classic Brunello from the same vintage). That wine is slightly more streamlined and contoured compared to the Altero that wears a heavier mantle made with thicker fiber and texture. This impression is especially evident on the bouquet where you pick up a hint of extra softness or ripeness that comes thanks to this warm vintage. The bouquet offers sensations of dried cherry skin or plum with sweet spice and moist potting soil. If you love classic Brunello, I would recommend the estate's annata expression. The Altero is more contemporary and international instead. With an eye towards the Tuscan coast, Poggio Antico's vineyards reach over 500 metres above sea level, and these breezy heights gave some reprieve to the vines in the warm 2015 vintage. Altero, which is a selection of the best barrels, demonstrates restrained perfumes of dried violets and lavender, red plum and fresh earth.

In 2009, the final blend was Tempranillo with 19% Mazuelo (or Cari\u00f1ena), one of the highest percentages of Mazuelo ever. The grapes are now sourced from the La Plana vineyard within the Ygay estate, one of the higher-altitude plots at 485 meters. The grapes fermented and aged separately, the Tempranillo in American oak barrels and the Mazuelo in French barriques for 26 months, given its power. It has that seriousness, character and somehow rusticity of the Mazuelo, austere, harmonious and still young. It has good depth and concentration, still young and lively with fine tannins and a backbone of freshness that lifts it up. It will develop for a very long time in bottle. This is a great classical Rioja for the long haul. 109,000 bottles and some larger formats were produced. It was bottled in October 2014. The prices are increasing but so is the quality.

A blend of 83% Semillon and 17% Sauvignon Blanc, the 2017 Rieussec is pale to medium lemon-gold colored. To begin, the nose blows you away with intense lemon tart, lime cordial, mango and quince notes followed by a second wave of floral, orange blossoms and honeysuckle scents, and then notes of crushed rocks, cr\u00e8me caramel and marzipan join the party. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is still very tightly wound with concentrated sweetness and a racy backbone to match, delivering layer upon layer of citrus and savory flavors, finishing on a persistent mineral note. Very involving and harmonious nose, without any obvious oak aromas yet. Cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e, and honey with fresh citrus fruit scents. Lots of botrytis, without being too much. Incredible creamy texture and depth, with honey and spices. Unctuous, but with great balancing acidity (considering the relatively low %age of SB). Very long finish, butterscotch and candied peel. Very long. Really great.\r\n Barrel Sample:  95-97 Delivers some rare floral lift for the vintage, with a honeysuckle edge out front, pulling creamed mango and papaya notes along.

Its power comes from luscious black fruits that are juicy and powerful. Expect this wine to age well and drink from 2024. A blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Merlot aged 18 months in 80% new French oak, the 2017 Chateau Pichon-Longueville Baron sports a vivid purple hue as well as gorgeous notes of creme de cassis and black raspberry fruits interwoven with classic Pauillac lead pencil, crushed rocks, chocolate, and violet notes. Full-bodied and concentrated, yet elegant and seamless, it has remarkable purity, flawless tannins, beautifully integrated acidity, and a great finish. It's going to hit the early stages of prime drinking in 7-8 years and cruise for 20-25 years or more. The currants, blackberries and spices are very pretty here on the nose.

Medium-bodied, the palate is elegant, refreshing and refined, with a compelling line of soft, grainy tannins and lots of perfumed accents, finishing fragrant. This is smokey, spiced and oak-finessed on the nose but with clear concentration and definition. There is a whole ton of cassis fruit overlaid with cloves and liquorice root, and it is reassuring to see that in 2017 there are still wines that achieve a sense of concentration and power. There is personality here and a sense of Pauillac tannic hold, and it is clearly capable of ageing. The 30hl/ha yield was not because of frost, but because of their low-yielding 60-year-old Cabernet vines. 80% new oak. Very deep purple colour.

Give bottles upwards of a decade and it will evolve for 30 years or more. Graphite, black chocolate, pencil lead, blackberry and liquorice. This is serious, not holding back on its confident sense of power and depth. 100% new oak coming through as toasted grilled almond aromatics, this has no issue with settling in for the long term and will deliver over the next two to three decades. Easy to love. The 2017 Mouton Rothschild is a blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc. Deep garnet-purple in color, it slowly unfurls to reveal notes of warm black plums, baked black cherries, kirsch and freshly crushed blackcurrants with hints of candied violets, cinnamon toast, Ceylon tea and pencil shavings. Medium-bodied, the palate is charged with amazing energy, featuring dynamic black and red fruits and loads of baking spice and mineral sparks, framed by ripe, fine-grained tannins and finishing long and fragrant. Given the intensity of fruit and structure, while this is a relatively elegant Mouton that will be approachable early on, I don\u2019t see it as being short lived. It should give pleasure for a good 40+ years.  Rating:  96+ The hint of new wood still shows in the aroma of this wine.

This hillside terroir escaped from the frost unscathed, and the 2017 is 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc, and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon brought up in mostly new oak. Its deep purple hue is followed by a rock star bouquet of pure creme de cassis, espresso roast, crushed violets, graphite, and a distinct sense of minerality. Deep, full-bodied, and concentrated, it has a wonderful sense of elegance, flawless balance, and again, awesome purity. This sensational effort has some upfront charm yet, given the tannins, a solid 7-8 years of bottle age are warranted and it should cruise for 25-30 years in cool cellars. There was no frost in the vineyard in 2017, due to its situation high upon the limestone plateau. Composed of 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, which was harvested from September 25 to October 3, the 2017 Pavie is very deep garnet-purple in color and rolls slowly and sensuously out of the glass with growing scents of Black Forest cake, black plum preserves, blueberry compote and fruitcake plus suggestions of melted chocolate, licorice, crushed rocks and Indian spices with a waft of violets. Full-bodied, the palate packs a powerful punch, laden with electric layers of energetic black and blue fruits. All this decadent fruit is supported by fantastic freshness and very, very ripe, velvety tannins, finishing with epic length. Location, location, location was everything in 2017. Pavie has one of the most enviable locations in all of Bordeaux and boy-oh-boy does it show in this spectacular wine. Profound, crushed blueberry and blackberry aromas here. Mint and chalk undertones. Full-bodied with a center palate of balanced and ripe fruit with polished and caressing tannins. Excellent finish that goes on for minutes. All in finesse and length. A wine to contemplate and enjoy. Better after 2024.

It slowly reveals itself in the glass and is really a lovely wine. This has real persistency, it keeps on revealing itself after it has left your mouth, and is not insisting too much - definite improvement after 18 months ageing, bodes well for the future. 3.6pH. A low yield of 32hl/ha but not one that is particularly unusual as they rarely go above 35hl/ha here. \u00a0This wine is rich. But it also has a poise and control that balances the richness. With its restrained power and black fruits, the wine will develop impressively. Drink from 2024. Inky black colour. Deep and spicy aromas. Less open than the Ar\u00f4mes, which is perhaps not surprising as this is in 80% new wood. Monster extraction and depth with tinglingly rich tannins and sweet fruit.

In truth, little about this massively built offering really surprises, given Mr. Hobbs's penchant for wines of commanding concentration and depth; and, while we expect that some might suggest that its extravagant oak and very ripe style are too much of a good thing, we admit to being wholly won over.

Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon Helms Vineyard has a gregarious nose of freshly crushed black currants, black berries and mulberries with touches of red roses, Indian spices, dried mint and unsmoked cigars. Medium-bodied, fine, fresh and elegantly styled, it delivers tons of black berry and spicy layers with a fine-grained backbone and very long, lively finish.

Deep purple-black in color, it practically explodes from the glass with rambunctious notions of baked black cherries, plum preserves and cr\u00e8me de cassis with hints of cigar box, fungi, tilled soil and woodsmoke plus a touch of crushed rocks. The full-bodied palate delivers mouth-coating black fruit preserves with a beautiful earthy undercurrent and a rock-solid frame of grainy tannins, finishing with fantastic length. A very serious second wine! Should age incredibly.  Barell Sample :93-95 The true second wine of the estate, the 2018 Pagodes De Cos is sensational stuff and clocks in at 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 6% Petit Verdot, and the rest Cabernet Franc that saw slightly more new oak than usual. Blueberries, cassis, crushed violets, and classy oak all flow to a medium to full-bodied effort that has incredible class and elegance as well as texture. Fresh, clean, and beautifully balanced, it\u2019s a terrific wine in its own right.  Barrel Sample:  92-94. Full of liquorice and dark chocolate, the nose is immediately seductive. This is a second wine that's full of fleshy, sexy, bright fruit and real elegance. It's a lovely wine, if clearly marked by the generosity of the vintage. The 30hl/ha yield was affected by a mix of mildew and some concentration in September. To control extractions, they macerated at a lower temperature of 27-28\u00b0C.

It possesses a great intensity that will delight you with its complexity (a mixture of red fruits) and the signature of its terroir in its empyreumatic notes (Havana cigars, chocolate, roasting, cedar wood and so on). On the palate, the wine is spherical and generous without a trace of aggressiveness. It lengthens on silky tannins, making this wine so obvious that the taster succumbs to its charm.", "reviews": "The 2016 La Mission Haut-Brion is a blend of 57.5% Merlot and 42.5% Cabernet Sauvignon. Deep garnet-purple in color, it is just a little muted to begin, soon unfurling to reveal slowly growing scents of crushed blackcurrants, black cherries, dark chocolate and candied violets with nuances of crushed rocks, tobacco leaf, forest floor and fragrant earth plus a hint of bergamot. Medium-bodied and exquisitely elegant, the palate offers perfectly ripe, fine-grained tannins and tons of freshness with layer upon layer of perfumed fruit and a very long, ferrous-laced finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n Rating: 98+ This is a wonderful wine, it\u2019s absolutely precise, finely wrought and gorgeously balanced between richness and elegance, with notes of damson, black cherry, slate and rosemary. Silky soft tannins highlight the concentration of the fruit and the grilled oak notes that are La Mission\u2019s signature, with a fresh core that stretches out the palate. A low pH gives tension through the palate, and is highly seductive. No Cabernet Franc this year. The 2016 La Mission Haut-Brion checks in as a Merlot-heavy blend, 57.5% Merlot and 42.5% Cabernet Sauvignon. About as pure and seamless (yet sexy) as they come in the vintage, it offers awesome notes of dried flowers, sweet currants, cedarwood, forest floor, and exotic spices. With a flawless texture, medium to full body, and ultra-fine tannins, this beauty builds incrementally on the palate with terrific mid-palate depth and a stunning finish. It\u2019s sexier and more charming compared to the more backward Haut Brion, yet I suspect it will age just as long. This is super vivid, offering cassis, blackberry, raspberry and blueberry compote flavors that bristle with energy while a mouthwatering frame of anise and apple wood adds electric energy. This is borderline rambunctious but it's bridled well enough and when the fruit and wood sides mesh fully, this will be a rock star. Best from 2025 through 2040. Regal wine, showing alluringly ripe and dark plums, that carries a wealth of complexity in its DNA - fine spices, leaves, graphite, violets and more. The palate has very precise drive and super focused style and delivers authoritative tannins that are arranged in linear fashion. Power with elegance. Try from 2024. As so often with this estate, this is a generous, opulent wine. This year a strong tannic element gives the wine a good structure. Smoky, textured and powerful, it needs many years to mature.

Medium to full-bodied, the palate is packed full of perfumed black and blue fruits, supported by ripe, rounded tannins and oodles of freshness, finishing long and fragrant.  Rating: 97+ Very attractive aromas of violets, purple cherries and plums with notes of chocolate, cedar and baking spices. The palate has a fullish feel with very concentrated, ripe dark plums, wrapped in super long, silky tannins. Quite a deep, flavorful finish, holding long and fresh. Try from 2023. This blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc has a satisfyingly rich and perfumed character. It is dense both with tannins and black fruits, ripe and with enough concentration to promise good aging. Drink from 2023. The 2017 Chateau Hosanna is a wonderful wine in the vintage, offering more pleasure and sexiness than most out there. Based on 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc, it sports a deep ruby/purple hue to go with fabulous notes of creme de cassis, black raspberries, crushed flowers, Asian spices, and incense. With a kiss of background oak, medium to full body, a silky texture, and stunning length, it's a classic, flawlessly balanced Pomerol to enjoy over the coming two decades. Violet edging and cherry red body, hints of gourmet chocolate, and a welcome return to some Pomerol flesh in a vintage where this character is a little thin on the ground. Hard to argue with the enjoyment here, and it's easy to recommend for its red fruits, rosemary, slate-edged finish that turns into a mouthwatering salinity. Drinking Window\u00a02025\u00a0-\u00a02040 Caressing in feel, with hints of ganache and incense draped over a core of warmed plum and cassis flavors.

POW\u2014the paradoxically ethereal, medium-bodied palate hits you with vibrant, exhilarating black fruit and previously latent floral layers, supported with fantastic freshness and super fine-grained, pixelated tannins, finishing with persistent mineral and perfumed layers. Truly. Stunning.\r\n\r\n Barrel Sample:  97-99 Deep and typical on the nose with blackcurrants, black tea, leather and graphite. The aromas draw you down to the palate. Full-bodied, creamy and beautiful with extremely polished, refined tannins. Yet, it\u2019s powerful and long. Highest percent of cabernet sauvignon ever. Juicy and almost exotic, but very tidy with ripe tannins. Try after 2025 and onwards. This wine is poised, gathering freshness and good acidity in the same structured container as the pure black-currant fruits. With 97% Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine has a classicism about it: fruity and structured at the same time. Drink from 2024. Deep ruby in colour but not so inky as to be impenetrable - that is not their style. Nose subdued at first, but on the palate it unfurls to show violet edging and rich but well defined black fruits. Lafite never tries overly hard to please everyone in its early years, and this will take some time to open up. There is plenty of concentration - there are hefty tannins but they are so finessed that you don't feel them at first. It will almost certainly take a full ten years to reach its drinking window, unlike many in 2017. Its 97% Cabernet Sauvignon means a lot of the power is implied at this point, with only a hint of Merlot to soften and gently layer up through the palate. Extremely impressive. A yield of 40hl/ha, only very lightly affected by frost. 99% new oak. 3.75pH. Very dark purple colour. Super concentrated aromas of black fruit and spices. Some cinnamon and earth, rosehip and violet. Very concentrated and earthy-spicy with deep black fruit flavours and elegance, deftness of tannins. Balanced, creamy texture with freshness and complexity. Very long\r\nfinish with fine tannins. It\u2019s powerful and flavoursome, but not the equal of the 2016.\r\n Barrel Sample:  95-97 This is a youthful tumble of warmed black currant, fig and blackberry paste flavors, entwined with bay leaf, tobacco, savory, lilac, smoldering charcoal and warm cast iron notes. Terrific stony minerality zips everything up for now, but riveting acidity and excellent energy should carry this easily in the cellar. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Best from 2025 through 2040. The grand vin 2017 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild checks as a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated blend that includes just 2.5% Merlot and less than 1% of Petit Verdot, brought up in new French oak. It shows the classy, elegant style of both the vintage and the estate, revealing a ruby/purple hue, complex notes of red and black currants, lead pencil, and cedary herbs, medium-bodied richness and depth, and both present tannins and acidity. It checks in behind the 2015 and 2016 yet is nevertheless a classic Lafite.

Drink from 2024 The 2017 Chateau Beychevelle is another beautiful wine from this estate, which is being run with incredible talent and passion by Romain Ducolomb, who was hired away from Chateau Clinet. The 2017 is based on 50% Merlot, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Petit Verdot, and the rest Cabernet Franc (a selection of just 52% of the production) and spent 18 months in 60% new French oak.

It\u2019s up with the top wines in the vintage and will evolve for 2+ decades. The 2017 Beychevelle is absolutely gorgeous. Creamy and beautifully layered on the palate, Beychevelle exudes exotic richness in its ripe red/purplish berry fruit. Even though the 2017 is rather flamboyant in style, it retains quite a bit of brightness to play off its more extroverted leanings.

Aromas of flowers, berries and light cedar with some milk-chocolate undertones. Medium body. Creamy tannins and a firm, caressing finish. Shows tension and focus. Better after 2022. Hawthorn and crushed earth on the nose, with touches of brambled hedgerow berries.

This is a definite break with the older Troplong style (also Aymeric de Gironde's first vintage as director, arriving just in time for harvest). Two years on, and it is really is rather lovely. Austerity is clear, as is true in so many of these wines, showcasing that 2017 is not a vintage for hedonists. But, this is bedding down for the long-term, and you can already feel the flesh laying down over the bones of the wine. Frost barely affected the vineyard at Troplong, giving a yield of 45hl/ha (in itself a bigger yield than was usual here in the old days), with 95% used for the grand vin.

It's not going to match the 2016, but it\u2019s certainly an elegant, pretty, graceful wine. Very fresh in feel, with silky textured plum, cassis and cherry flavors infused with rooibos tea, mineral and floral notes. The long, refined finish lets the pure fruit sing, while the minerally edge adds detail. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2021 through 2037. Very intense blue fruit and violet aromas. Concentrated and inviting. Some youthful oak, but predominantly deep fruit and cassis flavours. Rich with sweet spices. Concentrated and delicious, if a little warm on the finish.\r\n Barrel Sample:  91-93 There\u2019s some handy richness to the nose here and ripe, dense tannins anchor dark-fruit flavors on the finish.
