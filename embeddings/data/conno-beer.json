While the beer was aged in a foeder, I was unaware of that fact during the blind judging, and have left the review intact. Presented in a goblet @44 o F after a vigorous pour, the beer casts a deep purpleish-red color with saturated color infusions from the fruit additions. Haze is relatively high, but likely due to the apparent high fruit dosing. The nose is sharply acidic up front, with obvious berry fruit aromas and very little malt or sweetness evident. The berry notes are well blended, without any overtly pronounced chemical/perfumey tones so often associated with use of extracts and concentrates: the aroma here speaks to fresh or superbly well-processed purees. While I could not isolate blackberries, raspberries were front and center backed up by a nice blueberry note. Overall the nose is bright and fruity, with evident tartness and very low malt sweetness. The fruit aromas are very, very niceand come across fresh. The flavor character starts brisk and sharp, with a bite of lactic acid and then a full tart and lasting middle of dark berry fruit flavors, with the raspberry winning the show of dominance, with some darker berry character as first mate. The mid palate lingers tart, with only a hint of malt and sweetness to balance the appreciable lactic acid. The finish is dry, tart ( almost bordering on sour) with a nice clean lingering berry note that lasts and lasts and finally a small grainy, almost wheat-like malt sweetness come in softly. Conditioning is high but doesn't seem obtrusive even with the acidic character. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full, possibly due to fruit pectins adding viscosity. The ferment/sour character is quite clean and lacking any appreciable funk, vanilla, or other angular wild characteristics, vice some faint woody character that comes out with warming and swirling in the goblet. While the beer borders on being a bit too tart for me given its balance point (finishing gravity of 2.5 o P as measured), the fruit character is bright and fresh with very natural notes, and presents an ensemble berry character that highlights interactions more than direct profiles. Overall, it makes for a rounded and tart berry beerwith a clean and direct tart backdrop and wonderful fruit accents that really shine here.

An off white, sudsy head consisting of big bubbles fades quickly leaving a ring of big bubbles around the glass and a lovely lacing around the glass as its drunk.A grounded aroma consisting of moderate dank notes, bitter orange, tangerine, and low minerality is at the forefront.The sweetness of the malt is evident and of moderate-low intensity with a low grainy malt character. As the beer warms a low ethyl alcohol note manifests and adds to the beers complexity.The flavor consists of a moderate bitterness with a moderate hop flavor of grounded, musty, grassy, dark berry and tangerine notes.A moderate-high malt sweetness, with a low grainy flavor, quickly transitions in to the flavor and present a bitter, candied orange flavor coupled with a low minerality which lasts into the finish.Fermentation character appears to be neutral in this particular example.The balance is only slightly towards the hop bitterness, though the malt sweetness present provides a nice stage to even out the lingering aspect.The aftertaste consists of the bitterness, malt sweetness, citrus, and alcohol.This beer has a medium-light body with medium carbonation. A pleasant alcohol warmth is noticeable in this beer accompanied by a nice creaminess.Despite the increased hop schedule and use of the dry hop, there is no astringency in this beer.Overall, this an exceptional double IPA which showcases traditional American and citrus forwards hops coupled with a lovely malt base to provide a lovely enhancement of the hop profile.I enjoyed the citrus forward, juicy, profile of this beer and found it quite drinkable as a whole although I expected a touch more bitterness out of a Double IPA.

I don\u2019t perceive much maltiness, what I do get comes in the from of bready notes as the beer warms. No hop aroma. The color is interesting, it\u2019s a purplish red, like raspberry juice. There is not much in the form of carbonation so the head is pretty much non-existent. The beer is mostly clear with just a slight haze to it. The flavor is heavy on the oakiness and Brett. To me, those two flavors dominate. The barrel, in my perception seems to be new based on how prevalent the oak was. The wood comes off just a bit bitter. Its not hop bitterness as much as a woody tannic astringency. It\u2019s not a bad thing in this beer, more so an observation. The horse blanket/barnyard Brett character is pretty high and seems to overshadow the light summer fruitiness I get from what I assume are the wine grapes. The sourness of the beer is quite subdued and is more of an afterthought of the beer. It does contribute to the drinkability though. The beer is fermented well and sits well on my palate.

There is no impression of sweetness, which leads to an expectation of citrus tartness in the flavor. I also pick up a slight tar-like resin note in the background. No malt, no esters, nothing off. The beer is a pale straw color with some haze, which is acceptable for the style. Nice creamy white head keeps a cap on the beer to the bottom of the glass. The flavor comes across like fresh squeezed white grapefruit juice with a shot of pineapple, mixed into a glass of sparkling water. However, it is not tart or sour, nor is it sweet. There is a very low-level expression of grainy malt which keeps it from being total hop juice. Low levels of bitterness are aided by the dryness and the bite of carbonation. Very dry. The tar resin shows up at very low levels in the finish and lingers into the aftertaste. The body is thin with high levels of carbonation. Some carbonic bite but not unpleasant. Brut IPA is the newest of the IPA varieties. The goal of the Brut IPA, as I understand it, is to provide a very hoppy but not bitter, very dry, very drinkable beer with Champagne like effervescence. Shorts\u2019 Juicy Brut nearly accomplishes each goal. The hops are bright and citrusy but it seems the high carbonation drives them off rather quickly. While the carbonation level is high it falls short of effervescent. The dryness and low-level bitterness results in an easy drinking enjoyable beer. This would be a perfect refreshment for a hot summer day. Perhaps an increased hop presence and effervescence would bring it to perfection for the style but this is probably the best example of a Brut IPA I\u2019ve encountered."}], "rating": "90/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/shorts-brewing-co/juicy-brut"},

That category specifies it's for wild ales aged in wood or with fruit, herb, vegetableor spices added. This beer is just a wood aged wild ale. Let's take a closer look. In the aroma, it's very interesting that I get a noticeable hit of tart cherry, considering there is no fruit in the beer. I suspect there are caramel malts in conjunction with the oaked brandy character at play there. I do also smell some low amounts of sweet caramel malts and a very light toast. The hop aroma is fairly void, but the sourness is a pretty evident even in the nose. It has a light lactic aroma. Still that aside, it's clean with no other wild-like aromas. The beer poured amber in color, crystal clear, with no head. That can happen with some wild ales so it's not a huge deal. Still, a nice head is good to see on any beer. The flavor is mildly sweetwith a bit of caramel. There is a low amount of toasty malt that dries it out fairly quickly. Again, the tartness and sweetness combined with what I think is the brandy adds a cherry note to the flavor. The oak is also evident in the flavor, with a low oaky astringency from the tannins in the wood. The balance leans on the tart fruitiness. The bitterness ispretty lowbut barely balances the beer. It's mostly the tartness that prevents the beer from coming across sweet in the finish. The tartness and oaky astringency gives the perception of a dry finish. The body is medium, carbonation is crisp and poppy, and while not creamy, the beer is refreshingly tart and puckering. Overall, I really enjoyed the dynamics of this beer and found it very interesting and fun to drink. I could have used a bit more hop bitterness and aroma to make this beer a bit more beer-like as opposed to a funky wine. But some of the light caramel and toast did remind me that it's a beer.

The flavor is acidic and fruity expressing both good development of the wild yeast character and a rich pie-cherry fruit. The malt is not overworked, and a good malt sweetness balances the acidity nicely. I would characterize the malt and acidity as being very much complimentary. The body is medium with acidity and carbonation adding a bite in the finish that makes the overall mouthfeel sharp as it passes over the palate. There is a touch of warmth from alcohol in the finish as well. Overall, this is an exceptional Flanders Red Ale that manages to be sour, but not overly sour; malty enough to lend balance and sweetness to the tartness of the ferment; and fruity enough, with just a touch of wood character, to lend complexity and nuance to this wonderful beer. I would highly recommend finding a bottle as this beer expresses the tradition of the Flanders Red as well as any I have had in Belgium or elsewhere."}], "rating": "96/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/moody-tongue-brewing-co/oak-barrel-aged-flanders-red-ale"},

A lot of coffee, and not from the malt. I get actual coffee, which I later learned was written on the bottle. But it caught me by surprise because it was not billed to me to be an Imperial Stout with coffee. But yes, there is a certainly an unmistakable coffee presence which compliments the sweetness of the chocolate aroma. I do not pick up anything in terms of hops in the aroma. The alcohol is also very evident, and I'd put it in the moderately intense range. The roasted grains and mild sweetness are pleasant and intense. There is a little bit of plum in the back end as the beer warms. In the flavor, the beer is sweet and roasty. Mostly coffee and chocolate take the center stage. There is a moderate level of bitterness from the roasted grain and hops, but the beer is still finishing sweet. The bitterness is not cutting through it much at all. That's not uncommon for an Imperial Stout. Some of the sugar comes off a bit raw and burnt, like molasses. It works well in this beer. The flavors are intense and there are a lot of them, almost all from malt and the expected oxidation you get from extended aging. I get some dark caramel, a little molasses, chocolate, coffee, rum, and even dates. What I don't get is much from the barrel. Maybe it's blended well, but I don't get any wood character or even vanilla tones from the wood. Those are not required, but common. The rum notes can come from the barrel and alcohol. But my point is if you are expecting this to come across as most barrel aged beers these days, it doesn't. At least for me. This beer is full bodied and chewy, quite smooth, with a little burn of alcohol when it goes down. In the end, this beer is certainly in the right climate, as where I am it's cold and dreary at the moment. This is the perfect beer for that occasion. What I wish, is the beer was not as sweet as it was, and could be a bit more dry. It's going to be a one and done from a snifter beer for sure, as most imperial stouts are.

The difference between a standard American pale ale and a low ABV IPA is going to lay in the hop intensity.

I get more citrus in the flavor than I got in the aroma, but that tropical pineapple note carries into the finish. The bitterness is soft and just balances the lightly sweet malt.

Hibiscus is noted in the flavor providing some additional cranberry-like tartness and tannin. The tannin effect is welcome as it helps to elevate the tartness, which is otherwise a little low to style. The sweetness of the berries may also be serving to counter the lactic tartness of the beer. Some low levels of doughy wheat malt come in mid-palate and assist in rounding things out. The finish is moderately dry and is once again aided by the hibiscus tannins. A floral note makes an appearance in the aftertaste. The beer also features a medium-light body with moderately high levels of carbonation with some mouth-drying carbonic bite but not astringent. The beer provides a nice blueberry presence and the hibiscus aids in balancing the wheat. Overall it seems a little bigger and maltier than the style allows.

The beer pours a golden apricot color with significant haze and is topped by a creamy white head with great retention. The flavor profile provides some elevated levels of toasted oak and more white pepper spiciness. The phenolics are enhanced by some spicy hops. The funky notes bring a savory perception, somewhat like white balsamic vinegar minus the acetic acid. The spiced pickled lemon notes are accentuated by the moderately high levels of tartness as well as bitterness. The beer finishes dry as any good Saison should. The bitterness and a touch of wood linger deep into the aftertaste. Medium light body with moderately high levels of carbonation but not effervescent. There is some prickling to the tongue but not astringent. A touch of alcohol warmth is noted when its all said and done. Overall a fascinating beer that gives you lots to think about. As a Saison I would expect some additional carbonation. However, in this case I think the bitter and sour levels may have come across as harsh had they been elevated by effervescent levels of carbonation. The spiced lemon notes were a highlight for me, very tasty. The Brett character took first billing in the beer and was unexpected. Unfortunately, Brett was not provided as an element of the beer to be judged. Had the Brett been noted I would have judged it as an American Wild ale and scored it much higher. Personally, I love Brett and think this is a great beer. However, as a Wood-Aged Saison, the Brett could be interpreted as an infection from the barrel. As a Barrel-Aged beer the barrel character needs to me more apparent than what I found here. An enjoyable and interesting beer just know it is a Brett Saison, aged in oak."}], "rating": "89/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/pfriem-family-brewers/barrel-aged-saison-iii"},

Personally, I would have appreciated a little more roast or coffee to help offset all the sweetness and cut through in the finish. The barrel aging aides in providing some needed complexity. Whenever I see beers that provide a long list of ingredients like this, I worry that I\u2019ll find a muddled mess. The other issue with the long list is that it forces the drinker to seek out all the parts. Fortunately, this beer presents all the elements, albeit very subtlyin a sublimely well-integrated manner.

At least this was the profile after its reemergence from the grave as envisioned by Pierre Celis, former brewer at Hoegaarden. Over the years the style has come to take on more diverse and pedestrian variants, including relatively sweet, very low bitter orange flavored ale. I am presented with the beer served in a wheatbier glass at 43 o F. The beer's color is very light gold bordering on deep straw, with a faint haze and capped by a thick and creamy off-white head that exhibits moderate foam stand. Gas level appears high. The aroma is very light and dominated by a sweet orange (naval?) and faint orange peel character above a very light white-bread note. An additional aromatic angle is noted -- almost woody, but clean and dry, and definitely not like coriander. A very faint malt sweetness emerges as the beer warms slightly. No hops and decidedly dry in character. The flavor profile has a light bready malt front with a surge of orange and orange peel flavor dominating the middle, again juxtaposed with a elusive dry-woody note that is quite pleasant, and what does seem to be a bright citrus-spice angle from coriander. Bitterness is low vice apparent perceived bitterness from citrus zest/oil.The late palate has a long and lingering orange peel note and provides a nice flavor and lasting bitterness unlike that derived from hop resins. The finish is a hare short of bone-dry, but very light and thin. Speaking of mouthfeel, it's an interesting contrast, in that the beer has some viscous texture but still comes off watery and thin in body. Intrigued by the beer's modest but still very interesting finish, I tested the final gravity with with a precision finishing hydrometer and discovered at least some of the puzzle: 0.2 o P (~1.001). While the hyperattenuation does match the dryness, the beer retains a light wheat malt structure that balances against the relatively assertive orange-bitter notes. Overall, while somewhat of a far cry from \u00fcrtype renditions of the style, this beer is very flavorful while being light bodied, somewhat crisp and quite refreshing. Call it something like a brut wit and you wouldn't be far off. I really like it for what it is.

Being under specialty instead of double IPAcertainly isn\u2019t due to lack of hops as the aroma is very hop-forward with a punch-like blend of fruit - pineapple, berry, orange, grape, grapefruit - as well as some floral notes. This combines well with light sweetness from estery yeast (apricot, red apple) to bring you back to childhood with Hawaiian Punch, as well as a sweet bread-like malt background of fresh dough, lightly toasted grain and honey. The flavor is similar, with more sweet fruit - strawberry, white grape - but more citrus heavy - orange, grapefruit, lime, gooseberry - to give an almost sangria-like character (adult Hawaiian Punch). The low bitterness combined with the fruity hops makes for a soft,fairly sweet finish. I would like this to be a touch drier, but the sweeter finish seems to help the juicy fruit shine. This beer employs an experimental hop called HBC 472, which I had the pleasure of using in a homebrew club experiment. This hop appears to be chameleonic and adapts to its style as I used it in a porter and got more of the claimed woody, coconut tonesrather than the punch-forward fruit in this wonderful example.The fruit blend in this is truly remarkable, as even the hoppy homebrew examples were more pina colada-like being basically just pineapple and mild coconut rather than an assault of different fruits.

In the aroma the first thing I notice is wheat and slightly honey-like malt. There is a low floral hop aroma, some of which could be contributed to by the hemp. I do get a low fruity tone and very low salinity.The color is pale gold with a slight haze. This is OK for a wheat beer. The head was white and fizzy, it was also quite low and had poor retention. In the flavor I get that low wheat-like flavor and a very mild earthy tone that has to be from the hemp. There is a definite tartness, which is quite pleasant. There is a noticeable amount of salinity that combines well with the tartness. What doesn't seem to fit is the earthy woodsiness that I think comes from the hemp. It is not bad, just not exactly fitting like a good puzzle piece. The bitterness is low as it should be. The balance is leaning towards the tartness. This beer is light-bodied and has a medium-light carbonation. It could be a bit more carbonated, but not much more. The rest of the body is as it should be, there is no astringency or alcohol warmth, but there is the slightest hint of creaminess to the beer, which is nice. Overall, this beer is very good and I would certainly buy this. It would be fantastic on one of these warm summer days, as the afternoon fades to evening with that slight earthy and herbal tone. Granted it does the herbal note does separate itself from the rest of the beer, but, like I said, that's not necessarily a bad thing. It just doesn't seem to meld as well as it could.

Of the aroma characteristics, the coconut is the most obvious, though not completely dominating. The color is like used motor oil, dark and opaque, and a full, almost rocky tan head rests like a pillow on the top of the beer. The flavor is hugely nutty, probably from alcohol, with a heavy vanilla flavor. Both coconut and chocolate can be tasted as well, but unlike the aroma, the chocolate has the edge over the coconut. The malt leaves some residual sweetness, but the overall flavor and palate sensation is somewhat unusual, producing something akin to what I taste with an artificial sweetener. The distraction from this, and the somewhat dry finish, make the flavor and finish disappointing relative to the aroma. In addition to the sensations above, some alcoholic heat is also present in the mouth. If you are a fan of very nutty beers, you will probably like this one.

You pretty much just smell the malt, hops, and a little bit of the yeast. The hop aroma is low and lightly floral.

There was really not much in terms of head on the pour, which was a bit of a bummer. When it comes to the flavor, there were thankfully no surprises. The flavor was decidedly malty, with that low coffee bitterness from the roast, a little hint of dark chocolate, and what I think is a Munich malt-like grainy flavor. The hop bitterness is fairly low and the hop flavor matches. While low, you can still pick up a slight floral/earthy note. The rest of the beer is crisp, clean, and medium in body.

I did get a bit more of the apple and peach esters in the flavor, but they were low. Still, you don\u2019t really want those in a lager. The best part of the flavor by far was the hop flavor. It was bitter, and helped pull back some of that sweetness. The hop profilewas spicy and herbal,just as I was hoping for. Not over the top, but enough to take notice.

The appearance was beautiful -- this beer is a rich golden color, was mostly clear with some haze, and had a bright white head with moderate retention. The taste reminded me immediately of fruit punch, with a presence of a fruit characteristic similar to that in tutti-frutti gum.

Deep mahogany brown. Initial aroma is roasty sweet chocolate with moderate vanilla notes and moderate caramel and toffee notes - quite complex and interesting. The flavor echoes the aroma with roasty sweet chocolate, medium caramel, and additional cold brewed coffee notes. There are medium wood aged notes expressed as vanilla and toasted coconut. Lots of dark fruits - medium prunes, moderate overripe plums, slight notes of black cherries. There are some slight oxidation notes, but mostly coming across as sherry notes rather than papery, so quite pleasant. Medium-low earthy and floral hops compliment the roasty malt but are minor players. There is a moderate hop bittering that balances well. Medium-low soy sauce umami notes. This is a full-bodied beer, fairly low on the carbonation, but enough carbonation to present all of the aromas well. Take this beer out of the fridge, then open and drink another beer while you let this one warm up to 55 or 60 degrees to present all of its complexity.

The barrel notes come through as well with some vanilla and most likely the licorice I mentioned. When it comes to flavor, the beer is certainly what I pictured from the description. The dark roasted malts contribute a coffee-like flavor with a hint of chocolate. I get a medium bitterness from the hops and some of the flavor,which is a bit piney and herbal, but still on the lower end of the spectrum. The beer is incredibly smooth with a soft wash of bourbon and a moderate amount of spicy alcohol flavor. The vanilla tones come out in the finish and blend very well with the coffee and chocolate tones of the malt. The beer is mildly sweet with a light drying quality from the alcohol and grains. The mouthfeel is medium-full and very creamy. It's like velvet as I drink it. There is a moderate alcohol warmth and mild roasted grain astringency, but nothing off-putting. Overall this beer is exceptional. I would recommend seeking this beer out and trying it for yourself. It will be perfect for those summer nights sitting by a lake or campfire as you unwind from the day. The chocolate and vanilla tones are satisfying as a day finisher; toss the bourbon into the mix, and you are on your way to a good night. The only gripe is the hop character, while noticeable, is a bit low for the style."}], "rating": "94/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/goodwood-brewing-co/goodwood-bourbon-barrel-stout"},

Aromas focus on fresh squeezed orange juice, pineapple, pine resin \u2013 supported by freshly torn mintand low Tahitian vanilla.Over time, the pine resin/crushed needles with orange pith dominate other aromas. As expected, it is an opaquely hazy light gold color, though I anticipated more than a persistent 1/8\u201d head in my Belgian snifter glass. After the first taste, restrained flavors of pithy orange juice and frothy vanilla wheat create a clean-tasting experience.Arguably, it is one of the most drinkable NE IPAs I have tried.It does lack anticipated supporting hop bitterness in the finish or aftertaste.After a few sips, however, the pine resin hop bitterness balances out the not intense but very refreshing hop and malt flavors."}], "rating": "95/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/belching-beaver-brewery/digital-bath"},

Minimal, indistinct hop aroma was overwhelmed by the malty richness and holiday spices. Low, indistinct, fruity esters. Upon learning that lavender was in this beer, I could detect it, although in this brew the lavender character appears as a warming spice, and not at all floral. I still couldn't shake the perception that ginger, clove, and cinnamon were in this beer. This beer pouredamber, was quite clear, and had a low, off-white head with moderate retention. The flavor was similar in many ways to the aroma, although I also perceived chocolateand bread slices. The balance was certainly towards the sweet, and this beer could have benefited from stronger hopping or from fermenting out some of the additional sugars in order to dry it out a bit. There were no obvious fermentation characteristics, and no off-flavors. In the flavor, I perceived the lavender much more clearly, with a distinct and intense floral component. The mouthfeel was pleasant, with a moderate body, no creaminess, and no astringency. Still, there was something somewhat drying (on the tongue, not in the flavor) about the beer (I initially thought this might have come from winter spices, but now believe it more likely came from the lavender) that gave me pause before taking another drink. Overall, this is a really interesting beer! The idea of combining lavender with a malty beer like a Scotch Ale is a good one, and this beer gets a lot right -- the malt dominance is appropriate for the style, and while the 2015 BJCPguide might be a bit more skeptical about the butterscotch character, I enjoyed it, and lots of people expect it in a Scotch Ale. If there truly were no other other spice additions in this beer, then the lavender clearly did some very interesting things to this beer. However, the uneven presentation of the lavender, and the balance between sweetness and spice, left something to be desired."}], "rating": "78/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/motorworks-brewing/lavender-ale"},

The oak and acidity linger long after the dry finish. The body is medium with a slightly elevated level of carbonation. The high level of attenuation gives the impression of more effervescence and aids drinkability. This beer drinks well by itself but could be a showstopper if paired with the right dish. A simple salad with tangy goat cheese and a red wine vinaigrette would pair beautifully. While no pink peppercorn presence was detected, it may have provided some intangible qualities that aided in this beer\u2019s high complexity.

The beer comes to me in a nonic imperial pint after a robust pour: the beer is medium gold in color (~5 SRM) with a distinct haze. The foam is a thick off-white of mixed bubbles exhibiting excellent stand. The abundant and persistent outgassing indicates the beer is well conditioned, while the very light color clearly indicates minimal use of kilned/caramel malts in the grist, which is common in many modern IPA interpretations, where brewers (and patrons) are looking for hop forward character without a lot to get in the way. The aroma is classic west coast: pine, fresh citrus (lemon, orange, grapefruit) and a backdrop of cantaloupe sweetness, above a bready-cracker maltiness that is inviting and not overly acidic or angular. The dry-hop effect is obvious, and it appears the hops themselves were in good condition, making for a hop forward, but balanced nose, given the faint malt sweetness evident. I couldn't pick up any distinct ethanol, indicating its relatively modest strength. The beer's front palate is bright with pine and citrus character and trails to an immediate shot of bitterness that while firm is countered by some nice cracker-malt character. The mid-palate has a surprisingly strong malt backbone of the same cracker-biscuit flavors carrying along the orange-piney-resin and melon notes along with some residual sweetness into the finish that is clean and off-dry, with some lingering mineral and bitter notes. Overall the beer's palate is fuller than many light-gold IPA's I believe owing to a relative low degree of apparent attenuation and a deft and conservative hand with the kettle hopping (the former discounted based on a measured final gravity of 2.6o Plato). The body is medium and the mouthfeel has a nice creamy texture despite the high level of carbonation, making it a bit of a paradox: light, snappy and refreshing in that its not overbearing in its bitterness or hop flavors, while still well-balanced and appropriately hefty. All this produces a very drinkable IPA, with all the attendant features expected of west-coast interpretation that would work great to quench thirst on a hot summer afternoon, or provide liquid juxtaposition to a hearty and spicy meal: someone say green Thai curry? Well done, and should stand out even in a saturated market."}], "rating": "91/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/belching-beaver-brewing-company/phantom-bride-ipa"},

This is certainly a first for me to experience a saison with added grape juice and I conclude that it blends well! The appearance of the pour revealed a wonderful light brown hue that was somewhat cloudy with moderate carbonation. Cloudy is okay in this case as this style is often unfiltered. The flavor of this beer had a nice malt sweetness and a low hop profile. It had that really nice distinctive spicy/herbal character (almost clove-like) notable in the saison style balanced with a light touch of biscuit malt and yeasty characteristics. What made this saison wonderful was the slight touch of grape juice that lends a bit of sweetness and added profile. The profile also included raisins, perhaps from the oak barrel? The grape juice could have been added prior to bottling (dosage) much in the style of Champagne and perhaps giving it natural carbonation? Who would ever expect adding grape juice to a saison. The body and mouthfeel of this beer was medium with a nice sparkly palate due to the carbonation. It finishes smooth with a nice warmth in the mouth due to the 10.3% ABV.

The malts are layered in a level of sourness to imitate the characteristics of a non-boiled ale, brewed with Juniper in lieu of hops, and fermented with a phenolic blend of yeast strains.

It is bright and a tad tart, but underlain by a light caramel and crackermaltiness that gives the aroma some body.I don't detect any obvious ferment-derived esters, butwith so much hop and malt, the beer still screams strong, hoppy ale, just like the style warrants.While assertive, I also do not detect ethanol, which indicates the beer is of modest (for style) strength. A very obvious, light caramel-honey note emerges as the beer warms. The flavor starts out with a hint of honey and caramel that transitions quickly to a very solid, but not overdone bitterness (~55/60 BU if I had to guess) with the mid-palate flavors of pine, grapefruit, apricots and faint honey. The beer is very well-balanced, with the somewhat harsh bitterness of very short duration before the malt, hop, and ferment flavors catch up. Late palate is clean with slight mineral tones;a long lasting hop resin character persists well into the slightly off-dry finish. The mouthfeel is distinctly thick, owing to a relatively low level of conditioning.The snap and body would be lightened (and improved) with more carbonic. In sum, the beer is quite drinkable and tasty and highly representative of the ubiquitous west-coast IPA style, and quite well-balanced along the hop-malt gradient.It is neither very strong, nor ultra-hoppy, so fitting somewhere near the median point in flavor profile, this beer would likelyappealing to a broad range of palates.I'd like to try this beer paired with a nice rustic plate of antipasto with some assertive salumi, olives, pickled peppers,and hard cheeses.

My lovely assistant (my wife, amazing she puts up with me) presents a full classic nonic pint glass and boldly states\"Extra Pale Ale\". This sends me to the books looking for clarity and enlightenment.Well, so much for that.The 2015 BJCP guidelines don't denote a specific case for \"Extra\" which leaves me with a faint but firm memory that Extra simply means more, as in more pale , as in maybe golden, as opposed to amber in color.I know at one point someone was marketing them, and I bet I've even tried some, butnothing to serve as much of a benchmark comes forth.So... let's see what Google has to say. Woah -- bunches and bunches of them -- some from very well regarded breweries, so that's great. The downside is there appears no real common threadthat makes them \"Extra\".One has loads of Mandarin oranges added(?!), and, secretly, I'm hoping that isn't the case here*.I plod ahead, hoping it's as I thought \u2013a basic pale ale, but sans crystal malt, and a bit more snappy, maybe even a bit more gassy. Still, it's important to keep an open mind as styles are artificial attempts at groupings, no? They shift, they change with the times and ingredients, and pro brewers are under no strict requirement of systematics.Back to the beer. It presents a deep-gold/light amber-orange color with distinct haze. The big fluffy foam is a good twoinches and thick, and shows moderate stand and lacing. The aroma is bright and hoppy, with notes of pine, lemon, orange and distinct ester fruitiness (apricots) dancing with a nice biscuity-malt backdrop.It appears to lack caramel malt in the grist, unless of a particularly light color.While assertive in its hoppiness (and clearly dry-hopped) the beer has a nice well-balanced elegance of hops, malt, and fruity esters rolling up into an inviting nose that literally screams: pale ale. The flavor starts very clean with a lot of stone fruit (peach, apricot) married to the firm citrus note of red grapefruit and \u2013 say it isn't so \u2013 mandarin/orange; the bitternessis fairly light and does a great job cutting, but not overriding, the toasty-kilned malt mid-palate. If I had to guess there is both someMunich and some light crystal/honey type maltinthe grist. The late palate is clean and fruity with some mineral character and lingering bitterness.Mouthfeel and body are both medium, but seem a tad thick due to relatively low conditioning.The beer could definitely use a bit more gas. Overall, its a very nicepale ale with a good mix of classic North Americanpine/citrus hoppiness and bitteness with a big fruity and honey malt back end: lovely orange and stone fruitsboth countervailing the richgolden malt notes that underlay the style.The haze and the lack of CO2 are the only appreciable faults and I consider them very minor.It's a nice hop forward but balanced ale that reminds one that beers need to not be IPAs to strike a deep flavor profile that works both in the heat of the day and the cool of the night.As far as food pairings, I bet this would cut through a rich creamy beef stroganoff or a classic Hungarian goulash with aplomb. *Post-review addendum: Oops. I think this consititutes a bit of a faux pas on my part, as indeed the beer is citrus-infused, and despite my ignorant protestations, the beer is quite nice for it. However, having discovered this whenposting the review, I chose to maintain the independent review unedited, as it forms the fundamental basis for independence and bias-free information provided by blind reviews.I also confirmedthat there was no explicit instruction to review the beer as a fruit beer, and so I think that while I wasn't able to cognate the citrus as blood orange and rather took it as oranges and stone fruit, these types of flavors mingle very well in hoppy American-style ales given the rash offruit-chargedhops now in common use.

The flavor reflects similar qualities as the aroma - primarily lemonwith a hint of wheat; no hops are to be found. The finish is very lightly bitter and quitethirst quenching leaving a tingle of carbonation along with the hint of citrus. The thirst-quenching qualities of this beer are outstanding from the combination of light body, high carbonation, low sugar/dextrin content, and low alcohol (at 2.7% abv). While this beer style is not what most serious craft beer connoisseurs would enjoy, it certainly does fulfill what the style is meant to do: quench thirst with a beer product. Radler is a German style of beer that is typically a mixture of beer with lemonade or lemon-flavored soda.

A big foamy pink head tops the beautiful cranberry rose color beer. Clear but not quite brilliant. The head drops to a lingering creamy ring. Very pretty.

The tartness remains present throughout but is never harsh or distracting. Some alcohol warmth is noted in the dry finish. Medium light body with a touch of acidic bite but not unpleasant. There is a mouth coating tannin drying effect and again it adds to the overall pleasant drinking experience. By far the best in this series of the Fruit Lambic beers by Bullfrog Brewing.

The flavor is big, lush and sweet right out of the gate, with flavors of milk chocolate, dark chocolate and light-biscuit-caramel malt notes. The mid-palate bitterness is restrained and modest as it should be, and while it hits with a quick herbal note, it gets washed away in the middle and late palate by the long sweet finish that actually dries out a little in the aftertaste. The roast/chocolate malt and the apparent lactose really compliment each other and the malt/roast material flavors are really outstanding --I'm guessing UK malts.  While the beer's flavor profile shines with cocoa/chocolate and lactose flavors, the beers Nitrogen-influenced texture -and relatively thin body add an additional creaminess to the beer giving it both a lush and refreshingly quick finish.

In sum, this is a fine sweet stout with great English pedigree, that is not cloying and shouldn't be considered a dessert beer, but rather a nice roasty-sweet beer to be enjoyed by the pint.

Each year uses different sources of barrels which are then expertly blended together to deliver a unique offering for each year. This sample is from Batch 25, blended in August, 2016 (the 25 th year of La Trappe Quad brewing), and was evaluated as a 33B Specialty Wood Aged Beer using the 26D Belgian Dark Strong Ale in the 2015 BJCP Guidelines as the base beer. Beers in the Cat 26D style should deliver a mouth-filling rich aged malt character along with associated Belgian fermentation complexities that expand with age, with the character of the barrels used for the aging adding their own level of complexity for the Cat 33B style. This offering does not disappoint in that respect. The aroma has a complexity of sweet raisin, plum, fig, alcohol, vanilla, aged caramel, malt and typical Belgian esters and phenolics. Very attractive and inviting! There is a subtle oak character that comes through in the background as well. The beer pours a hazy brown color with an initially solid off white small bubble head that is fleeting. This low head retention is quite common for beers of this style. The flavor mirrors the aroma quite well. A solid complexity of aged malt and fermentation characters as seen in the aroma come through in the flavor, however, I actually expected more. This somewhat reduced malt complexity could be due to the aging process used, with a little loss due to the barreling. Interestingly, the body is on the light side of medium, and the sweetness is also light to moderate, not becoming overly sweet or cloying. Alcohol is quite evident. The finish is quite dry for the style, and the aftertaste retains the same flavor characters as is up front, but it is quite warming due to the alcohol presence. The alcohol is mainly good old ethanol \u2013 not a lot of higher fusel alcohols present. There is a slight wine-like tartness that works well to add even more complexity. Carbonation is at a light-moderate level. Importantly, the oak barrel notes that are present marry well with the character of the beer, never becoming a predominant flavor. Putting it all together, the overall package delivers a remarkably smooth drink for the style while still maintaining those delicious Belgian Quad flavor characteristics. La Trappe Oak Aged Quadrupel Batch 25 is a quite complex yet amazingly easy to drink offering. Definitely a keeper and highly recommended, either to partake in now or to cellar for a while for even more complexity.

The beer features crystal rye malt, Belgian-style yeast, and noble hops. The bottle displays Iron Maiden's mascot \u201cEddie\u201d, a constantly transforming creature of the dark withhim adorning a Monk\u2019s robe as \u201ca nod to the Trappist monastic brewing tradition in Belgium\u201d according to Bruce. \u201cHallowed\u201d is no doubt in reference to Iron Maiden\u2019s classic \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d from the 1982 album The Number of the Beast . This dark amber, almost light brown ale starts with an aroma of moderate toffee and caramel malt with a slight nutty accent, light plum esters, and a slight peppery phenolic. The body is medium with a moderate-light carbonation. The moderate toffee and caramel malt is slightly sweet and is complimented by a hint of chocolate. The light plum and raisin esters compliment the slightly sweet dark malts while a light peppery phenolic provides contrast. The finish is just bitter enough to keep the beer from becoming cloying; the layers of malt flavors linger throughout the finish. This beer has a lot of depth in malt character while light Belgian yeast derived phenolics provide balance.

The aroma is full-on orange sherbet push-up: you know, the ice cream deserts that you may have had as a kid with all the multi-colored dots on a little cardboard tube full of orange creamy goodness. The blending of the vanilla with the orange is uncanny in this regard. With some warming, you can almost tell there is a beer lurking underneath with subtle hints of malted barley. The appearance is a little hazy. A very light rim of effervescence clings to the edge of the glass. The color is a slightly opaque gold that hints at orange. The flavor is dominated by orange zest, some pithiness from pulp or that white stuff on the inside of an orange peel, a relatively large dose of vanilla, and some bitterness (hops, orange peel, both?). That orange push-up desert is less defined in the flavor, primarily because of the slight clash with the bitterness that becomes a little astringent in the finish. A perception of sweetness is also detectable, almost juicy. In addition to the astringency, a little bit of cloying sweetness lingers along with a touch of nutty, almost almond-extract tinge. All said, this doesn\u2019t have the delicacy of a cream ale and, frankly, tastes like a much bigger beer. I would say that those of you with a penchant for orange-flavored beers or a passion for orange push-ups (the food kind, not the oranges doing push-ups kind) should give it a whirl."}], "rating": "80/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/garage-brewing-co/orange-vanilla-cream-ale"},

This beer certainly hits the \"stout\" and \"peppers\" notes in the aroma, although I am not sure that the two play nicely together. The appearance was standard for an imperial stout -- almost jet black, with a dark tan / light brown head with moderate retention. The mouthfeel was also standard for this type of beer -- the beer was full bodied, with moderate carbonation that gave a mouth-filling sensation. As would be expected for a beer with hot peppers in it, there was substantial burning that remained in my mouth and throat for at least 10 minutes (I'm a spicy-food lover, so this wasn't a problem for me, but it was quite a physical sensation!) The flavor contained many of the notes I was hoping to detect -- coffee and chocolate were present in abundance. However, the dominant flavor and sensation were from the heat. Spiciness coated my tongue, and grabbed my attention away from the very interesting base beer and towards the less interesting 'wow, this is spicy' experience. This, paired, with a low cardboard flavor (I couldn't tell whether this was from oxidation or a result of the semi-paperish flavor that some pepper beers have) made it difficult to concentrate on what promised (from the aroma) to be a stellar imperial stout. In short, I would run out to get an imperial stout from these guys, but unless the ghost pepper presence were toned back substantially, I would prefer this stout without the vegetable addition."}], "rating": "79/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/central-waters-brewing-co/space-ghost"},

Moderate bready base malt and a light spicy hop flavor fight through, with a moderately high hop bitterness that lingers through a medium dry finish into the aftertaste. Light black pepper is noticeable in the aftertaste. Moderate astringency is drying and likely derived from the spice additions. A light and smooth alcohol warming rounds out this beer. An enjoyable beer, but the peach cobbler character is too much in the forefront and tends to dominate the beer rather than complimenting the base Belgian style strong ale. The Belgian yeast characteristics are present but pushed well into the backgroud. A reduction in spices would allow the base beer to shine through and create a more pintable ale."}], "rating": "85/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/garage-brewing-co/holidation"},

The low bready malt is also simple enough that it doesn\u2019t compete with the hops or add extra sweetness unlike many double IPAs, which helps the balancing act and negates the need for the high level bitterness.

A light spicy alcohol note and a hint of bready malt emerge as the hops settle down.The hop character shifts slightly in the flavor, offering a light pine and resin flavor to complement mixed tropical fruit.An assertive hop bitterness emerges mid-palate and lingers into the medium-dry finish.As with the aroma, the light spicy alcohol and bready malt make an appearance late to add balance to the hops.The alcohol is smooth, and theoverall hop character is fresh and bright making this a very quaffable Double IPA. This is an extremelywell brewed, and big, American-style Double IPA with the expected hop punch in the face. If you\u2019re a hop head this is the beer for you\u2026 and if you\u2019re not a hop head, you just might become one after enjoying a can of this world-class brew."}], "rating": "96/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/knee-deep-brewing-co/lupulin-river"},

The malt backbone was low and grainy and the fermentation character was clean. The beer was rose colored with a golden edge to the pink. Light haze and a moderate, pink tinged ivory head with good retention completed the appearance. In the flavor, medium hibiscus character had a hint of vegetal/green plant material as part of the package.

Medium high bitterness and medium harsh astringent flavors lingered into the finish. The body was a little heavy, close to medium full and medium carbonation was observed. There was a medium low drying astringency that lingered on the palate. This beer smelled great but some harsh, lingering notes in bittering, coupled with an overly heavy malt character and a somewhat lower hop flavor made the sipping less enjoyable than the smelling.

Hop aroma is high and prominent and consists of mainly of Centennial style / citrusy and floral notes. A low doughy malt aroma hides behind the hops, but provides a nice stage for their showcase. Light fruity esters blend well with the hops and are almost undetectable and there is a slightly yeasty note, which adds a touch of complexity. Light wisps of alcohol are present in the nose as the beer warms. In the flavor, high hop bitterness is at the forefront of the profile and is assertive and persistent after the swallow. Hop flavor is moderate-low and consists of light resin, light spiciness, and light citrus, which manifests in the aftertaste. Low malt flavor consisting of slight graininess is clean with a low malt sweetness, but this is quickly overtaken by the balance which quickly leans towards the hop bitterness. Slight yeasty notes are present in the flavor profile as well. Beer finishes with a medium-dry finish which is aided by lingering bitterness and a slight alcohol presence. As the beer warmed there was a very slight sulfur note which also added a layer of complexity and depth. Mouthfeel for this beer consists of a medium body with medium carbonation which is slightly tickling on the tongue. This beer has a smooth texture on the palate. There is a very slight noticeable alcohol warmth, but this does not interfere with the overall pleasure of the beer per the style. Overall, this is a very good and well-crafted IPA. This beer will appeal to those whom bitterness is their muse. Both stylistically and personal preference, I would have liked to have seen a little more prominent hop flavor in the beer, but I still enjoyed this beer overall and would absolutely order it if seen on tap or for retail sale as it is well done and very enjoyable."}], "rating": "90/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/anthem-brewing-co/anthem-ipa"},

A white head quickly fades leaving a scant trace throughout the drinking of the beer. On the nose, a low and sublime spicy hop aroma provides a base note with a moderate-high aroma consisting of tropical fruit (mango and papaya) taking the stage. As the beer warms, the aroma falls outside of being hop derived and seems slightly artificial. Malt aroma is very sublime in relation to the hop character. Fermentation character is low and the esters are reminiscent of peaches and blends harmoniously with the fruit aroma. In the flavor, a low grainy malt character blends with a moderate spicy hop flavor and hop bitterness. The moderate tropical fruit flavor looses its intensity noted in the aroma after the swallow due to a harsh character that lingers on the palate. The beer is balanced towards this harshness after the swallow. Peach esters are slightly present but are also lost to this lingering harshness. The body of this beer is medium-thin with moderate carbonation. The beer has a slight astringency that dries out the tongue and sides of the mouth. Overall, the biggest detractor from this beer was the lingering harshness and astringency, which interfered with the balance, smoothness, and refreshing character the APA style is known for.

Presented as a Tropical Pale Ale, the initial blast, before even looking at it, is certainly tropical! Huge notes of passion fruit pop out of the glass. Beyond this, toasted coconut is resilient. Oddly, clean alcohol also is pretty apparent, but the beer is very clean and hugely tropical, though the pineapple gets lost, which prevents this from being a pi\u00f1a colada. Really in the vein of the new school juicy pales and IPAs that are en vogue. As it warms, a faint note of biscuity malt becomes apparent. In terms of appearance, the beer is a murky deep gold with zero head. The beer almost looks like it has an oily meniscus atop it and the bubbles that are aroused stay trapped within the beer. Once the beer is tasted, I get a bit confused as the fruitiness that was anticipated is muted overall. The bitterness doesn't totally balance everything out here either. Passion fruit notes and that pineapple that's advertised seem to add an acidic note and the coconut gets lost in the taste. The finish is a bit bitter and distinctly tropical. Again reminds me of those new school pales and is very clean and super drinkable with a balanced finish. The mouthfeel has an impression of medium + body and borderline oily. Given the appearance, I expected low carbonation, but it is medium- and works here. Not unpleasant on the palate, but not totally on point. Overall, this beer does manage to work, though the oily aspect (which I attribute to the coconut) is pretty distracting and deadens the flavor initially, but ultimately the beer does come together in the end.

This example smells distinctly of coffee and cream, with a dark cacao note, roasted malt, and slight char. It\u2019s hard not to imagine this being served in a warm mug.

The beer shows full conditioning, evidenced by lively outgassing. The aroma is rich with piney resin and a manifold blast of bright fruit notes: tangerine, peach, and apricot above a distinctly candy sweet backdrop. While no ethanol is evident, the nose is big and lush with both malt and hop accents coming through in a pleasant marriage of fruitiness. The flavor starts bright with distinct apricot and pine/fir notes, with the mid-palate bitterness nice but relatively restrained. Middle flavors of hop notes bring out a slightly herbal component reminiscent of dried oregano. Late palate is slightly sweet with a resurgence of ripe stone fruit (peaches and apricots) dancing with faint caramel in a long and slow finish. Mouthfeel is medium, with some astringency due to what seems like a very high dosage of flavor hops. The beer is smooth and betrays its strength due to the dry finish and well-composed hop/malt balance. Overall the beer comes off somewhat more like a regular IPA (possibly at the high end of the strength range) rather than a double. It also does not suffer the malady that many double IPA's are cursed with -- poor attenuation and disjointed bitterness/sweetness. This beer falls short of being a full-on fruit bomb, but has very nice and approachable west-coast hop notes that are supported by a pleasant but somewhat subtle malt/light caramel note that is short in the palate and lets the dry finish emphasize the piney/fruit flavors so prevalent in new American hop varieties.

My assistant greets me with a tall glass of copper colored beer capped with an inch of off-white dense foam, intoning \u201cImperial Rye ESB\u201d. Hmmm. This presents a bit of a challenge for classification. Naturally, I look to the moniker ESB for roots \u2013 English real ale of a strong-ish sort, often deeply amber in color and rich in malt with classic English herbal, earthy, and slightly woody tones from U.K hops. What to do about Imperial? That seems fairly straightforward in the it is a very strong version therein. But how strong? Rye? That\u2019s a bit of a curve. I have a modest group initially to consider: English Strong Ale, Old/Stock Ale, English Barleywine all seem possible, and then depending on the rye character, maybe even a special grain variant on one of those three (you never know!). I took a cautious route and decided to let the beer speak to me and then see what made sense. As noted the beer is gorgeous: a deeply saturated copper with red tones with a light and dense foam of lingering presence, sustained with regular outgassing. The aroma is malty rich and vinous, with a caramel/candied sugar front with some dark candied-cherry fruit and a spicy-toasty back, overlain on an herbal-earthy note of sage, savory, and epazote that provides a mild counterpoint to the lingering sweet richness and alcohol evident in the nose. As the beer warms the spicy/phenolic and grainy element from the rye become a tad more pronounced. Overall the nose is massive in malt with some angular complexity and a big shot of alcohol. The initial flavor is strong with spicy-malt and a modest bitterness, only slightly dulling the lush sweetness of the malt that manages to remain in dominance throughout the taste profile. Deep dark, candy caramel and dried candied fruits (cherries, elderberries) and a respectable herbal note are complimented by the reemergent rye character in the mid-palate. To the end the malt remains powerful, trailing to a big and lingeringly off-dry (bordering on sweet) finish with some herbal hop and a hint of woodiness complimenting the late mouth sweetness. The taste profile is interesting in that its very malt-forward, but the strong rye character along with dry-herbal, tea-like hops- do a good job of providing balance and keeping the beer from being cloying. Mouthfeel is viscous and very full; a hint of astringency is likely sourced from the rye malt, but isn\u2019t out of place: like the spiciness in the flavor, it provides counterpoint to what might otherwise be a simply too sweet beer. Overall the beer has a nice, sweet and lush malt character, complimented by both rye and English style hops and a bit of aged, woodiness. The profile would seem to fit either the Stock Ale or English Barleywine variants of the tribe, but given its expressed ethanol character, I\u2019ll opt for calling it the latter. While the rye character is fairly obvious an deft, I\u2019m not sure it presents enough uniqueness to call out stylistically. No matter, this is a fine beer of big and assertive flavor and strength, with clear English pedigree. It hits all the right notes of deep, rich and fruity maltiness, some balancing herbal hop notes, and a lingering alcoholic heat, albeit a bit peculiar (or should I say peculier?) given the rye. The strength and driving rich maltiness certainly lend itself well to a mid-winter digestif enjoyed in front of the hearth.

The off-white head is creamy and leaves an ocean wave foam splash pattern on the glass. The flavors when sampled in an IPA glass, briefly taste of slight mint, then hop astringency. In mid-palette, this falls away revealing a clean frothy white flour and pine resin aftertaste. The resin leaves a physical impression on the tongue. On the second taste, pine resin becomes more prominent. It coats the tongue, like a butter made of pinecones being spread on your tongue with a knife. After five minutes, the flavors are now a thin caramel glaze on a pineapple/pine resin tart. In the Belgian glass, the hop bitterness and astringency dominate the flavor but are less defined, backed by a soft, white bread character. After five minutes, more hop pine resin and caramel candy wafers appear. The IPA glass showcases a well-integrated, moderate carbonation, a dry, slight mouthwatering finish, with a non-intrusive alcohol warming. In the Belgium glass, the IPA shows more lingering alcoholic heat. In both glasses, overtime, the heat builds. Overall, the flavor and mouthfeel are all heat and hops. Outstandingly fresh hop aromas and bright flavors but lingering warming heat builds and becomes harsh and is not complimented by the hop astringency"}], "rating": "89/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/anderson-valley-brewing-co/ee-tah-ipa"},

The nose is very pleasant and quite perfumey, with a distinct bourbon barrel prominence. The alcohol is quite aromatic and clean, with some low fruity esters & vanilla. A low floral note follows with some dark fruit (fig) & a cherry stone quality. Very pleasant, if a touch hot/boozy. On tasting, it is loaded with chocolate & vanilla and a light burnt note that works here. Deeply fruity, again with cherry and fig from the combination of darker malts & fruit esters. The cocoa notes are almost sweet, suggesting possible vanilla additions. On top of this is a distinctly big & burly/boozy beer. Bitter black malts finish up the beer. It has a very full body and is quite bitter, which keeps the sweetness in check. Big and boozy, with an alcoholic finish that's slightly hot & prickly. This all made sense once I learned that this is a bigger version of Dragon's Milk, tipping the scales at 17%, though it never seems that big! Super cool beer and a neat take on the original Dragon's Milk. While not totally a stout, it comes off as a blend of a barleywine and Imperial Stout.

So what we are going to do is judge this beer against category 28B, Mixed-Fermentation Sour Beer. This category basically looks for a sour and/or funky version of a base style beer. We are going to consider the base style to be the pale wheat ale, since a classic style is not mandatory for this category. In the aroma I do get some light wheat aroma, as I would expect from a wheat beer. You don\u2019t get any of the banana or clove you would expect in a hefeweizen, but keep in mind this is not a hefeweizen it's a pale wheat beer. So don't go looking for traditional hefeweizen attributes. So we do get the wheat, although light. There is a light lactic sour aroma, and a moderate green apple-like aroma which doesn\u2019t seem to fit the rest of the aroma profile. Hops are present, although light and floral. There is no Brettanomyces or other \u201cwild\u201d character other than the lactic aroma. The beer poured a dark yellow with a light haze, as I would expect with a wheat beer. The head was very low and had almost no retention. What was there was a light ivory in color while it lasted. In the flavor we do get some light grainy wheat and a very light honey-sweetness. The tartness from the kettle souring is evident, as beer is moderately sour, so it\u2019s not overly puckering. I find the sourness to be pleasant. Hop flavor is low and slightly lemony, possibly from the play with the tartness. The beer is balanced more towards the wheat malt and lactic sourness combined. Both the bitterness and hop flavors are quite low. I do feel the beer would benefit from a bit more complexity, as it feels a bit one-dimensional with the souring agent. Mouthfeel is light in body but medium in carbonation, which I find works for this beer. There is no alcoholic warmth, no astringency, or creamy texture to the beer. A bit more textural sensation to the beer would benefit. In the end I found the base style was OK although a bit one-dimensional. The sourness level was quite pleasant and all in all it\u2019s a good beer. It would benefit from an addition to the grain bill, possibly a very small amount of toasted malt, and a slight boost in fruity, late-addition hops. I think the bitterness worked for the sour style, but could have used some supporting hop flavor."}], "rating": "88/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/aspen-brewing-co/silver-city-ale"},

There is little else to smell, and you would not expect there to be from a cream ale base.

The flavor has a bitter orange flavor with a distinctive oily character, again very much like you would expect if you tasted or nibbled a little bit of orange peel. The initial burst of flavor from peel is tempered by a gentle malt flavor, although sweeter than a typical cream ale would be expected to possess, likely from the honey listed as a special ingredient. The mouthfeel is relatively astringent, probably from those oils mentioned before and possibly from the pithy character that an orange rind would be expected to produce. Generally, it is not a very complex beer, although that is no a problem. The bigger issue is that the one dimension that stands out is a strong citrus rind character, and that plus the honey addition makes this almost more like a soda pop than a beer.

Casey doubles down and employs both of these which take over much of the saison character. The beer pours a deep straw color with a faint haze lending to golden notes and a bright white head with some Belgian lace. The aroma has a moderately strong lactic tart/funk (green apple, lemon) up front similar to that of a young lambic. This leads into a fruity/tropical hop-like character and some crackery, doughy malt underneath. Finally there is a bit of the classic saison character with some light spice (white pepper, ginger, anise) and earthy notes. The flavor is similar with the fruity hop character (white grapes, mango) and lactic tartness at forefront. Despite the hoppy character, there is very low bitterness, but the dry slightly puckering finish holds back any sweetness. It is rather cider-like in how it sits on the tongue. This beer does a wonderful job of marrying the hops to the sourness, but it leaves the farmhouse behind at the alter. Saisons can have a bit of tartness and hops to them, but this exceeds those levels, especially on the sour front and would better suited just calling it what it is, a dry hopped sour ale.

As a SessionIPA, this beer is hop-forward but lighter in body. It's got a sharp hop nose and a slight sulfidic bite. The nose is rich with pine notes and more rounded hop qualities. It almost feels like you're putting your whole face into a bag full of hop cones. The nose gets richer as it warms up, with faint plum esters and a mild green apple character coming forward. Its dark gold in color with a fairly nonexistent white head, andsslight chill haze in the glass doesn't detract from the overall experience. In the mouth, there is a very sharp,hop-forwardbite that is washed away by a subtle malt sweetness, followed by a lingering hop bite. It's very effervescent and sharp on the tongue, though it's not astringent at all, thoughit is quite drying in the finish. This is definitely ahop-heavy lighter beer. I would have liked to see more rounded characters to balance the hoppiness\u2013I'm thinking how British pale ales use estery qualities from the yeast to add depth, or more of a malt backbone.

Alow, wheaty malt presence pops up in thearoma but it gives way to thetypical (though surprisingly subdued)lactic characters and a very low brett-like trace. The cherry aroma is fairly low and quite lower than I expected based on the color. The flavor is fairly tame, and well-suited as an introductory sour for someone not sure if they want to dabble in sour, tart beers yet. The cherry flavor is enough for you to notice it throughout the entire experience and is reminiscent of fresh cherry pie filling. There is also some lactic tartness,very low brett funk, and low cherry flavors underneath it all. There is a moderate hop bitterness in the finish that serves well to balance out the sourness and cherry, andit leaves you ready to drink more. Overall, the flavor is clean and non-offensive, the mouthfeel is medium-lowwith medium-high carbonation, and the tartness is mildly puckering and sensible. Overall, the beer is a good starter beer for those wanting to get into sours. I particularly liked the cherry flavor, whichwas well-balanced and quite tasty. The only issue I have is that the beer lacked a bit in the lambic category. It could have used just a bit more brett funk and a little more lactic sourness. The cherries did add some nice sweet and tart character, but the base beer seemed a bit tame for a lambic. All in all,it\u2019s a great sour for the masses or those looking to see what sours are all about without getting their taste buds assaulted.

This beer doesn't go that far, but there's certainly an argument to be made that it doesn't offer much beyond a naked hop character that lacks sufficient malt contrast. The beer pours gold and clear with a foamy white head. The initial aromas are of grapefruit and citrus, with no real malt presence, and there's not much development as it warms and opens up. The aroma is also surprisingly restrained: you have to hunt for the hop aroma, which is surprising in a beer with nothing much to get in the way of it! It's pretty rare for me to note \"high bittering\" as an initial flavor, but that's the dominant flavor here. Everything else \u2013 even the hop flavor, strangely \u2013 is decidedly secondary to that. In terms of malt flavor, there's a hint of graininess, and a medium-low level of fleshy citrus, but that's about it. The finish is dry and a little austere, with slight astringency that is helped along by the relatively high level of carbonation. The bottom line? This is afairlyone-note and nondescript Session IPA that definitely features the bittering elements of hop character over its flavors or aromas. This wasn't an unpleasant beer to drink, but I doubt I'd ever go back for a second \u2013 and that's notgood news for any session beer. This beer pouredclear orange with a thick white head that dissipatedquickly. The initial and persistent aroma was bitterly hoppy without anyfloral or fruity elements. The tasteevidenced both malt, though without any discernible or notable characters, and the same bitter hoppinessexperienced in the aroma. The high IBUs expected for the style were present, but primarily throughearly (rather than late) kettle additions, resulting in a very bitter but notably unflavorful taste profile. The body was abit thin, appropriately lacking alcohol strength, but also bereft of pleasant palate sensations.

Wisps of vanilla and chocolate blend with the sweetness and are grounded out by very slight roast note. No hop aroma or fermentation characteristics are detectable. The flavor is comprised of moderate-low malt sweetness with very slight malt derived chocolate flavor, which blends well with an equally proportioned vanilla addition as well as a touch of roast, similar to the aroma. However, the overall malt flavor is very thin and \u201cneutrally sweet.\u201d Very low hop bitterness is present in this beer with no hop flavor. No fermentation or yeast character is evident. Balance is towards the malt sweetness, however the finish dries out about 7 seconds after the swallow leaving a fairly neutral aftertaste. The body is thin with typical gentle nitro style carbonation. There is no detectable alcohol warmth. This beer is creamy due to the body and use of nitro. There is a slight astringency apparent after the sip due to the use of roast grains, which appears to be accentuated by the low ABV and apparent low final gravity of the beer. Overall, this beer could benefit from a more depth in its malt flavor profile as well as more complex residual sugars to carry into the finish to balance out the neutral aftertaste and eventually manifested astringency. Despite its thin malt flavor character this beer is disproportionally sweet and could also use a firmer bittering hop presence as well. However, the overall light qualities and characteristics of this beer make it sessionable and thirst quenching."}], "rating": "80/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/nitro-vanilla-porter"},

It starts sweet and grainy, but resolves into a deep resinous bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The overall effect is nice, but it would be hard to drink two. Edit: I feel like this review needs some commentary. This beer was submitted as a Czech pilsener, which is a crisp, malty, hoppy, clean continental pilsener. The actual classification is \"bohemian pilsener\" and Pilsner Urquell is the benchmark for the style. Morimoto Imperial Pilsner clearly did not fit the style, being quite a bit bigger, hopper, and just all-around boozier beer than a crisp, easy bohemian pilsener would be. In addition, there is a strong corn flavor, which in European pilseners is considered a defect. The corn is from DMS, di-methyl sulfide, a naturally occurring result of the brewing process which is often found in American pilsner styles (think Rolling Rock). It was probably quite common in Pre-Prohibition lagers, as the early American brewers did not have access to the same technologies as their European counterparts. I decided to review the beer as such. The American Classic Pilsner (A Brewer's Associationclassification) is the latest iteration of the Pre-Prohibition lager style. It's a catch-all for pale lagers that don't fit the modern American or European lagers, and a really good fit for Rogue's imperial pilsner. Early American settlers from europe brought their beer-making traditions with them as they settled across the United States, and the style is meant to recognize the lagers our early brewers probably made, with what they had available here. The Rogue Morimoto Imperial Pilsner itself is big and boisterous, not at all delicate, and I can imagine it being one of the more popular beers 100 years ago. Corn character is totally appropriate for this style as well.

The hops are not so much minimal as they are fugitive, ceding a great deal of the flavor and almost all of the aroma to the grist.

{"name": "Liberator", "origin": "Connecticut, United States", "price": null, "abv": "8.5", "description": "Hopped with German and Czech hops and fermented with Bavarian lager yeast, this traditional doppelbock blends an extensive amount of select dark malts to achieve its rich and creamy character. Rich and filling, this brew is a malt lovers dream.", "reviews": [{"date": null, "author": "BC Review", "rating": "80/100", "body": "Since launching in 2003, Thomas Hooker Brewing Company has pumped out a lineup of solid ales and lagers from the brewery in Bloomfield, Connecticut. While traditionally a seasonal, Thomas Hooker offers its rich chocolate and roasted coffee-accented Doppelbock year round \u2013 noteworthy considering an 8.5 percent ABV. Overflowing with hints of Belgian milk chocolate and acrid, highly-kilned espresso beans, the aroma is more aggressive than one would expect of the style. Tom\u2019s first whiff was \u201cdominated by a blast of alcohol, mellowing quickly to sweet chocolate and cacao nibs.\u201d Overall, he felt the aroma\u2019s overtly assertive smack was out of place in a doppelbock. Like Tom, Lee keyed in on the strong notes of roasted coffee and dark chocolate, opining that they were \u201cmore befitting an imperial stout than a lager.\u201d Though he had to burrow down beneath the slight acrid roastiness, Lee did pick out a deeply buried, sweetish alcohol twang.  This beer is dark, brooding, and impenetrably opaque and throws a small head of loose, tan bubbles. While the flavors track with the nose\u2019s assertive roasted aroma, the beer evinces an underlying sweetness that keeps the whole thing in balance. The chocolaty sweetness struck Pete as \u201ca tad overpowering\u201d and \u201cconflicted with the beer\u2019s overt roastiness.\u201d He did, however, enjoy the warm, slightly alcoholic finish. Strong and bold with roasted flavor, Liberator is a powerhouse best served after the sun has set."}], "rating": "80/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/liberator"},
{"name": "Pumking", "origin": "New York, United States", "price": null, "abv": "8.6", "description": "All Hallows Eve is a time of the year when spirits can make contact with the physical world, and when magic is most potent. It is thought that we harness this magic to brew our powerful pumpkin ale. Not so, but it is with great respect to the magic of their trade that our brewers produce this fine beer. Take a whiff of this complex ale and your journey has just begun. At first sip, a magical spell will bewitch your taste buds, yet another victim enraptured by the Pumking.", "reviews": [{"date": null, "author": "BC Review", "rating": "75/100", "body": "Starting a second decade of brewing operations, Southern Tier Brewing Company enters the seasonal holiday beer fray with Pumking, its own unique take on imperial pumpkin ale. Brimming over with loads of nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice, married deftly with obscene quantities of sweet, chewy malt, this beer has garnered an intensely loyal following. Tom was intrigued by the competing notes of \u201cpecan pie and sweet, honeyed malt,\u201d but noted a distinct lack of pumpkin in the nose. Its glittering spun gold color, brilliant clarity, and lively effervescence belie Pumking\u2019s not inconsequential 8.6 percent ABV, promising a much lighter, more readily quaffable brew. Flavors of sweet creamery butter, Graham cracker pie crust, and hot buttered rum are front and center, with myriad spices interwoven among them. The sheer intensity of flavors took Lee somewhat aback, as he tasted by turns, \u201cbuttered Graham crackers, Brach\u2019s butterscotch candies, and sweetened pumpkin pie puree,\u201d all the while looking for an underlying beer. Pete, too, was floored by the \u201calmost syrupy butterscotch,\u201d yet pushed past that to find comforting notes of \u201ctoasted pumpkin seed and silky Zanzibar cinnamon.\u201d The prominent butterscotch sweetness left the judges a bit ambivalent overall. Any style questions aside when it comes to pumpkin taste, given that it\u2019s crammed with exotic spices, any beer lover would enjoy finding Pumking on hand at the end of a chilly winter's day."}], "rating": "75/100", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/pumking"}
