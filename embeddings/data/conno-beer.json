{"name": "The Call", "origin": "Michigan, United States", "price": null, "abv": "6.6", "description": "The Call is a sour ale fermented with our in-house sour culture and aged for two years before being finished on over 3,500 pounds of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries, fueling a spontaneous secondary fermentation.", "reviews": "The Call from New Holland Brewing is a sour ale with raspberries blackberries, and blueberries, and is being judged as BJCP category 28C Wild Specialty Ale (with fruit). While the beer was aged in a foeder, I was unaware of that fact during the blind judging, and have left the review intact. Presented in a goblet @44 F after a vigorous pour, the beer casts a deep purpleish-red color with saturated color infusions from the fruit additions. Haze is relatively high, but likely due to the apparent high fruit dosing. The nose is sharply acidic up front, with obvious berry fruit aromas and very little malt or sweetness evident. The berry notes are well blended, without any overtly pronounced chemical/perfumey tones so often associated with use of extracts and concentrates: the aroma here speaks to fresh or superbly well-processed purees. While I could not isolate blackberries, raspberries were front and center backed up by a nice blueberry note. Overall the nose is bright and fruity, with evident tartness and very low malt sweetness. The fruit aromas are very, very niceand come across fresh. The flavor character starts brisk and sharp, with a bite of lactic acid and then a full tart and lasting middle of dark berry fruit flavors, with the raspberry winning the show of dominance, with some darker berry character as first mate. The mid palate lingers tart, with only a hint of malt and sweetness to balance the appreciable lactic acid. The finish is dry, tart ( almost bordering on sour) with a nice clean lingering berry note that lasts and lasts and finally a small grainy, almost wheat-like malt sweetness come in softly. Conditioning is high but doesn't seem obtrusive even with the acidic character. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full, possibly due to fruit pectins adding viscosity. The ferment/sour character is quite clean and lacking any appreciable funk, vanilla, or other angular wild characteristics, vice some faint woody character that comes out with warming and swirling in the goblet. While the beer borders on being a bit too tart for me given its balance point (finishing gravity of 2.5 P as measured), the fruit character is bright and fresh with very natural notes, and presents an ensemble berry character that highlights interactions more than direct profiles. Overall, it makes for a rounded and tart berry beerwith a clean and direct tart backdrop and wonderful fruit accents that really shine here. Salud!

The beer did pour a solid gold color, mostly clear with just a very slight haze, and low white fizzy head typical with what we see with most American or Mexican lagers. The flavor is very nice, sadly we received this one in fall. It's a summer crusher for sure. Like the aroma I get a moderate tasty cracker-like malt and a slight hint of lime. There is some sodium, but it's very low. So low that I probably wouldn\u2019t even realize it if I wasn\u2019t told it was there. The hop bitterness is low, there is not really any hop flavor. Overall the beers flavor is clean and crisp. The balance is to the malt, and I thoroughly enjoy that. It's very easy drinking. For the mouthfeel, it's medium-light, and has a nice creamy texture. The carbonation is middle of the road, and not too poppy. I really enjoyed this beer, but it would be suited for summer for sure. We received this in fall and it brought me right to the beach.

At least this was the profile after its reemergence from the grave as envisioned by Pierre Celis, former brewer at Hoegaarden. Over the years the style has come to take on more diverse and pedestrian variants, including relatively sweet, very low bitter orange flavored ale. I am presented with the beer served in a wheatbier glass at 43 F. The beer's color is very light gold bordering on deep straw, with a faint haze and capped by a thick and creamy off-white head that exhibits moderate foam stand. Gas level appears high. The aroma is very light and dominated by a sweet orange (naval?) and faint orange peel character above a very light white-bread note. An additional aromatic angle is noted -- almost woody, but clean and dry, and definitely not like coriander. A very faint malt sweetness emerges as the beer warms slightly. No hops and decidedly dry in character. The flavor profile has a light bready malt front with a surge of orange and orange peel flavor dominating the middle, again juxtaposed with a elusive dry-woody note that is quite pleasant, and what does seem to be a bright citrus-spice angle from coriander. Bitterness is low vice apparent perceived bitterness from citrus zest/oil.The late palate has a long and lingering orange peel note and provides a nice flavor and lasting bitterness unlike that derived from hop resins. The finish is a hare short of bone-dry, but very light and thin. Speaking of mouthfeel, it's an interesting contrast, in that the beer has some viscous texture but still comes off watery and thin in body. Intrigued by the beers modest but still very interesting finish, I tested the final gravity with with a precision finishing hydrometer and discovered at least some of the puzzle: 0.2 P (~1.001). While the hyperattenuation does match the dryness, the beer retains a light wheat malt structure that balances against the relatively assertive orange-bitter notes. Overall, while somewhat of a far cry from \u00fcrtype renditions of the style, this beer is very flavorful while being light bodied, somewhat crisp and quite refreshing. Call it something like a brut wit and you wouldn't be far off. I really like it for what it is. The last couple days here have been harbingers of the Central Valley Summer that is coming toward us, with high's in the 90 F range. I also actually have some lawn to mow and three more cans at my disposal. I think you get the picture. ", "rating": "91", "url": "https://beerconnoisseur.com/beer/new-holland-brewing-co/lightpoint"},
