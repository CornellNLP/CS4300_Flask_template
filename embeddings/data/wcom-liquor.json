They released small quantities of Lot 29 (1929), which remains the most ethereal Cognac I have ever tasted. I\u2019m no expert, but their newest release, the 1953, seems close in quality to the 1929. Slightly darker than the 1929, the 1953 is pure silk, which at this alcohol level is very dangerous indeed.
