    "summary": "Mary Anning (21 May 1799 \u2013 9 March 1847) was an English fossil collector, dealer, and paleontologist who became known around the world for important finds she made in Jurassic marine fossil beds in the cliffs along the English Channel at Lyme Regis in the county of Dorset in Southwest England. Her findings contributed to important changes in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the Earth.\nAnning searched for fossils in the area's Blue Lias cliffs, particularly during the winter months when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. She nearly died in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first ichthyosaur skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete plesiosaur skeletons found; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations played a key role in the discovery that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods. When geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior, the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.\nAnning did not fully participate in the scientific community of 19th-century Britain, who were mostly Anglican gentlemen. She struggled financially for much of her life. Her family was poor, and her father, a cabinetmaker, died when she was eleven.\nShe became well known in geological circles in Britain, Europe, and America, and was consulted on issues of anatomy as well as about collecting fossils. Nonetheless, as a woman, she was not eligible to join the Geological Society of London and she did not always receive full credit for her scientific contributions. Indeed, she wrote in a letter: \"The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone.\" The only scientific writing of hers published in her lifetime appeared in the Magazine of Natural History in 1839, an extract from a letter that Anning had written to the magazine's editor questioning one of its claims.\nAfter her death in 1847, her unusual life story attracted increasing interest. An uncredited author in All the Year Round, edited by Charles Dickens, wrote of her in 1865 that \"[t]he carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it.\" It has often been claimed that her story was the inspiration for the 1908 tongue-twister \"She sells seashells on the seashore\" by Terry Sullivan. In 2010, one hundred and sixty-three years after her death, the Royal Society included Anning in a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science.",

The books' enduring popularity and impact on lesbian identity has earned her the title \"Queen of Lesbian Pulp Fiction\". Bannon was a young housewife trying to address her own issues of sexuality when she was inspired to write her first novel. Her subsequent books featured four characters who reappeared throughout the series, including her eponymous heroine, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the archetype of a butch lesbian. The majority of her characters mirrored people she knew, but their stories reflected a life she did not feel she was able to live. Despite her traditional upbringing and role in married life, her novels defied conventions for romance stories and depictions of lesbians by addressing complex homosexual relationships.\nHer books shaped lesbian identity for lesbians and heterosexuals alike, but Bannon was mostly unaware of their impact. She stopped writing in 1962. Later, she earned a doctorate in linguistics and became an academic. She endured a difficult marriage for 27 years and, as she separated from her husband in the 1980s, her books were republished; she was stunned to learn of their influence on society. They were released again between 2001 and 2003 and were adapted as an award-winning Off-Broadway production. They are taught in Women's and LGBT studies courses, and Bannon has received numerous awards for pioneering lesbian and gay literature. She has been described as \"the premier fictional representation of US lesbian life in the fifties and sixties\", and it has been said that her books \"rest on the bookshelf of nearly every even faintly literate Lesbian\".",

Her widely praised 1951 bestseller The Sea Around Us won her a U.S. National Book Award, recognition as a gifted writer, and financial security. Her next book, The Edge of the Sea, and the reissued version of her first book, Under the Sea Wind, were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths.\nLate in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially some problems that she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter.",

She was the author of The Real World of Technology, which is based on her 1989 Massey Lectures; The Ursula Franklin Reader: Pacifism as a Map, a collection of her papers, interviews, and talks; and Ursula Franklin Speaks: Thoughts and Afterthoughts, containing 22 of her speeches and five interviews between 1986 and 2012. Franklin was a practising Quaker and actively worked on behalf of pacifist and feminist causes. She wrote and spoke extensively about the futility of war and the connection between peace and social justice. Franklin received numerous honours and awards, including the Governor General's Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case for promoting the equality of girls and women in Canada and the Pearson Medal of Peace for her work in advancing human rights. In 2012, she was inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame. A Toronto high school, Ursula Franklin Academy, has been named in her honour.\nFranklin is best known for her writings on the political and social effects of technology. For her, technology was much more than machines, gadgets or electronic transmitters. It was a comprehensive system that includes methods, procedures, organization, \"and most of all, a mindset\". She distinguished between holistic technologies used by craft workers or artisans and prescriptive ones associated with a division of labour in large-scale production. Holistic technologies allow artisans to control their own work from start to finish. Prescriptive technologies organize work as a sequence of steps requiring supervision by bosses or managers. Franklin argued that the dominance of prescriptive technologies in modern society discourages critical thinking and promotes \"a culture of compliance\".\nFor some, Franklin belongs in the intellectual tradition of Harold Innis and Jacques Ellul who warn about technology's tendency to suppress freedom and endanger civilization. Franklin herself acknowledged her debt to Ellul as well as to several other thinkers including Lewis Mumford, C. B. Macpherson, E. F. Schumacher, and Vandana Shiva. This debt was not without recognizing that this list was largely absent of women. In addition to the Philosophy of technology, she believed that science was \"severely impoverished because women are discouraged from taking part in the exploration of knowledge\".",

    "summary": "Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 \u2013 September 2, 1992) was an American scientist and cytogeneticist who was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader in the development of maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research for the rest of her life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis\u2014a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock discovered transposition and used it to demonstrate that genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off. She developed theories to explain the suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Due to skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953.\nLater, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and ethnobotany of maize races from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as other scientists confirmed the mechanisms of genetic change and genetic regulation that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic transposition; she is the only woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize in that category.",

The first woman to be appointed as a lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom, she worked at University College London (UCL) from 1898 to 1935. She served as President of the Folklore Society from 1953 to 1955, and published widely over the course of her career.\nBorn to a wealthy middle-class English family in Calcutta, British India, Murray divided her youth between India, Britain, and Germany, training as both a nurse and a social worker. Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with department head Flinders Petrie, who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her Junior Professor in 1898. In 1902\u201303 she took part in Petrie's excavations at Abydos, Egypt, there discovering the Osireion temple and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology. Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes and lectures at the British Museum and Manchester Museum, it was at the latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum-nakht, one of the mummies recovered from the Tomb of the Two Brothers \u2013 the first time that a woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy. Recognising that British Egyptomania reflected the existence of a widespread public interest in Ancient Egypt, Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience.\nMurray also became closely involved in the first-wave feminist movement, joining the Women's Social and Political Union and devoting much time to improving women's status at UCL. Unable to return to Egypt due to the First World War, she focused her research on the witch-cult hypothesis, the theory that the witch trials of Early Modern Christendom were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian, pagan religion devoted to a Horned God. Although later academically discredited, the theory gained widespread attention and proved a significant influence on the emerging new religious movement of Wicca. From 1921 to 1931 Murray undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on Malta and Menorca and developed her interest in folkloristics. Awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927, she was appointed assistant professor in 1928 and retired from UCL in 1935. That year she visited Palestine to aid Petrie's excavation of Tall al-Ajjul and in 1937 she led a small excavation at Petra in Jordan. Taking on the presidency of the Folklore Society in later life, she lectured at such institutions as the University of Cambridge and City Literary Institute, and continued to publish in an independent capacity until her death.\nMurray's work in Egyptology and archaeology was widely acclaimed and earned her the moniker of \"The Grand Old Woman of Egyptology\", although after her death many of her contributions to the field were overshadowed by those of Petrie. Conversely, Murray's work in folkloristics and the history of witchcraft has been academically discredited and her methods in these areas heavily criticised. The influence of her witch-cult theory in both religion and literature has been examined by various scholars, and she herself has been dubbed the \"Grandmother of Wicca\".",

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have been appointed. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism.\nA research chemist before becoming a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his Conservative government. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election.\nOn moving into 10 Downing Street, Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and increasing unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt in 1984.\nThatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987. During this period her support for a Community Charge (referred to as the \"poll tax\") was widely unpopular, and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher (of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. In 2013 she died of a stroke in London at the age of 87.

Gerty was not a nickname, but rather she was named after an Austrian warship. Growing up at a time when women were marginalized in science and allowed few educational opportunities, she gained admittance to medical school, where she met her future husband Carl Ferdinand Cori; upon their graduation in 1920, they married. Because of deteriorating conditions in Europe, the couple emigrated to the United States in 1922. Gerty Cori continued her early interest in medical research, collaborating in the laboratory with Carl. She published research findings coauthored with her husband, as well as publishing singly.

She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win twice, the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences, and was part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris.\nShe was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister Bronis\u0142awa to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and with physicist Henri Becquerel. She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nHer achievements included the development of the theory of radioactivity (a term that she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world's first studies into the treatment of neoplasms were conducted using radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today. During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.\nWhile a French citizen, Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie, who used both surnames, never lost her sense of Polish identity.

She was the head of the Neoplatonic school at Alexandria, where she taught philosophy and astronomy. She is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded.\nHypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor. Although no writings directly written by her have survived, it is thought that she may have edited the surviving texts of Euclid's Elements and Ptolemy's Almagest and possibly co-written some of the commentaries attributed to her father, Theon of Alexandria. She also wrote a thirteen-volume commentary on Diophantus's Arithmetica, which may survive in part, having been interpolated into Diophantus's original text, and an eight-volume popularization of Apollonius of Perga's treatise on conic sections, which has not survived. She is known to have constructed astrolabes and hydrometers, but did not invent either of these, which were both in use long before she was born. Although she herself was a pagan, she was tolerant towards Christians and taught many Christian students, including Synesius, the future bishop of Ptolemais. Towards the end of her life, Hypatia advised Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was in the midst of a feud with Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christian monks known as the parabalani under the leadership of a lector named Peter.\nHypatia's death shocked the empire and transformed her into a \"martyr for philosophy\", leading future Neoplatonists such as Damascius to become increasingly fervent in their opposition to Christianity. During the Middle Ages, Hypatia was co-opted as a symbol of Christian virtue and scholars believe she was part of the basis for the legend of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. During the Age of Enlightenment, she became a symbol of opposition to Catholicism. In the nineteenth century, European literature, especially Charles Kingsley's 1853 novel Hypatia, romanticized her as \"the last of the Hellenes\". In the twentieth century, Hypatia became seen as an icon for women's rights and a precursor to the feminist movement. Since the late twentieth century, some portrayals have associated Hypatia's death with the burning of the Library of Alexandria, despite the historical fact that the library no longer existed during Hypatia's lifetime.",

She uncovered the discrepancy between the predicted angular motion of galaxies and the observed motion, by studying galactic rotation curves. This phenomenon became known as the galaxy rotation problem, and was evidence of the existence of dark matter. Although initially met with skepticism, Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades. Her legacy was described by The New York Times as \"ushering in a Copernican-scale change\" in cosmological theory.\nBeginning her academic career as the sole undergraduate in astronomy at Vassar College, Rubin went on to graduate studies at Cornell University and Georgetown University, where she observed deviations from Hubble flow in galaxies and provided evidence for the existence of galactic superclusters.\nRubin spent her life advocating for women in science and was known for her mentorship of aspiring women astronomers. Her data provided some of the first evidence for dark matter, which had been theorized by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s. She was honored throughout her career for her achievements, and received the Bruce Medal, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, and the National Medal of Science, among others.",

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have been appointed. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism.\nA research chemist before becoming a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his Conservative government. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election.\nOn moving into 10 Downing Street, Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and increasing unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt in 1984.\nThatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987. During this period her support for a Community Charge (referred to as the \"poll tax\") was widely unpopular, and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher (of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. In 2013 she died of a stroke in London at the age of 87. Always a controversial figure, she has nonetheless been lauded as one of the greatest, most influential and widest-known politicians in British history, even as arguments over Thatcherism persist.",

She completed her BSc in 1937, and afterwards received a prize to travel to England where she spent 18 months at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. While at Kew she worked on a revision of the Australian grass genus Enneapogon. When Nancy returned to Australia she continued her study of Australian plants through the University of Western Australia, completing her MSc. in 1945.\nIn 1943 she was appointed assistant agronomist at the Waite Agricultural Research Institute in Adelaide, where she started working on native pasture species for arid and semi-arid South Australia. She was appointed to the new position of systematic botanist at the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry, Canberra in 1946. At CSIRO she worked on organising and extending the herbarium, first as a research scientist and then as curator and was responsible for laying the foundations of the Herbarium Australiense, later the National Australian Herbarium. She wrote Key to the South Australian species of Eucalyptus L'H\u00e9r. but had not specialised on the genus.

While at Kew she photographed and indexed type specimens of Australian plants and made microfilm copies of Robert Brown's notebooks for Australian herbaria.\nWhen she returned to Australia in 1954 she began a very productive period of her career. She wrote an extensive paper \"The phytogeography of the Australian region\" which was published in the Australian Journal of Botany in 1960 and contributed to the award of her DSc by the University of Western Australia in 1961. Her Dictionary of Australian Plant Genera was published in 1963, and she completed studies of the plant groups Nicotiana, Sesbania and Helichrysum. Many of her publications included her own drawings. After resigning her position as curator of the herbarium she went on to be heavily involved in the development of the Flora of Australia series, directing the project from 1973 to 1977. In addition to her books, she also wrote over 50 papers on phytogeography, ecology, botanical history and Australian plant genera.

She married Noam Chomsky in 1949, the two having known each other since she was five years old. Her mother had been a teacher at a Hebrew school where his father was the principal. She was awarded a bachelor's degree in French from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951.\nThe couple spent some time living in HaZore'a, a kibbutz in Israel. Although enjoying themselves, Noam Chomsky was appalled by the Jewish nationalism and anti-Arab racism that he encountered in the country, as well as the pro-Stalinist trend that he thought pervaded the kibbutz's leftist community. It also was way before there were even words about women's rights\" according to Judith Chomsky, wife of Noam Chomsky's younger brother. Despite Carol's interest in becoming a mechanic or driving a tractor, at the time of the Chomskys' stay in 1953, they moved to USA.\nShe earned a doctoral degree in linguistics from Harvard University in 1968, having attended the school in order to ensure that she would be able to make a living in the event that her husband would be sent to jail for his active opposition to the Vietnam War.\nChomsky's best-known work is her book The Acquisition of Syntax in Children From 5 to 10 (1969) which investigated how children develop an understanding of the underlying grammatical structure of their native language and how they use this skill to interpret sentences of increasing complexity as they get older. Despite earlier scientific beliefs that children complete their acquisition of syntax by the age of five, Chomsky's research showed that children continue to develop the skills needed to understand complex constructions beyond that age.\nAs part of her research to understand how children develop the ability to read, she developed a method in the late 1970s called repeated reading, in which children would read a text silently while a recording of the text was played. The child would repeat the process until the text could be read fluently without the tape. Research showed that four readings accompanied by a recording could be enough to provide added reading fluency for most children. More than 100 studies have been performed on the technique, with most finding statistically significant improvements in reading speed and word recognition.\nShe served on the faculty of the Harvard Graduate School of Education from 1972 until 1997.\nChomsky died at age 78 on December 19, 2008 of cancer, in her home, in Lexington, Massachusetts.",

    "summary": "Fellowship of the Royal Society is open to scientists, engineers and technologists from the United Kingdom and Commonwealth of Nations, on the basis of having made \"a substantial contribution to the improvement of natural knowledge, including mathematics, engineering science and medical science\". Election to the Fellowship is highly regarded and sought after, bringing prestige to both the individual academically and the institution the Fellow is associated with. For scientists in the United Kingdom, the recognition is considered second only to being awarded the Nobel Prize.\nWhile there was no explicit prohibition of women as Fellows of the Royal Society in its original charters and statutes, election to the Fellowships was for much of the Society's history de facto closed to women. As a result of the dissolution of nunneries in connection with the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII, and female exclusion from schools and universities, the formal education of British girls and women was effectively non-existent throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Women slowly gained admittance to learned societies in the UK starting in the 19th century, with the founding of the Zoological Society of London in 1829 and the Royal Entomological Society in 1833, both of which admitted women Fellows from their inception.\nThe first recorded question of women being admitted to the Royal Society occurred in 1900, when Marian Farquharson, the first female Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society, sent a letter to the Council of the Royal Society petitioning that \"duly qualified women should have the advantage of full fellowship\". In its reply, the Council stated that the question of women Fellows \"must depend on the interpretation to be placed upon the Royal Charters under which the Society has been governed for more than three hundred years\". When Hertha Ayrton was nominated for Fellowship in 1902, her candidature was turned down on the basis that as a married woman she had no standing in law. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 made it illegal for an incorporated society to refuse admission on the grounds of an individual's sex or marital status. While the Society acknowledged the provision of section 1 of the Act in 1925, in reply to a question originally put to them by the Women's Engineering Society three years prior, it was not until 1943 that another woman was nominated for Fellowship. Kathleen Lonsdale and Marjory Stephenson were duly elected in 1945, after a postal vote amending the Society's statutes to explicitly allow women Fellows.\nAs of 2014, a total of 133 women have been elected Fellows. Two women have been elected under the Society's former Statute 12 regulation and one Honorary Fellow for their service to the cause of science. Another four women, from the British Royal Family, have been either Royal Fellows or Patrons of the Society. Of the approximately 1,600 living Fellows and Foreign Members, 5 percent are women.",

    "summary": "The Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics, also called the Satter Prize, is one of twenty-one prizes given out by the American Mathematical Society (AMS). It is presented biennially in recognition of an outstanding contribution to mathematics research by a woman in the previous six years. The award was established in 1990 using a donation from Joan Birman, in memory of her sister, Ruth Lyttle Satter, who worked primarily in biological sciences, and was a proponent for equal opportunities for women in science. First awarded in 1991, the award is intended to \"honor [Satter's] commitment to research and to encourage women in science\". The winner is selected by the council of the AMS, based on the recommendation of a selection committee. The prize is awarded at the Joint Mathematics Meetings during odd numbered years, and has always carried a modest cash reward. Since 2003, the prize has been $5,000, while from 1997 to 2001, the prize came with $1,200, and prior to that it was $4,000. If a joint award is made, the prize money is split between the recipients.\nAs of 2017, the award has been given 14 times, to 15 different individuals. Dusa McDuff was the first recipient of the award, for her work on symplectic geometry. A joint award was made for the only time in 2001, when Karen E. Smith and Sijue Wu shared the award. The 2013 prize winner was Maryam Mirzakhani, who, in 2014, was the first woman to be awarded the Fields Medal. This is considered to be the highest honor a mathematician can receive. She won both awards for her work on \"the geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces\". The most recent winner is Laura DeMarco, who was awarded the prize in 2017 for her \"fundamental contributions to complex dynamics, potential theory, and the emerging field of arithmetic dynamics\".\nThe Association for Women in Science have a similarly titled award, the Ruth Satter Memorial Award, which is a cash prize of $1,000 for \"an outstanding graduate student who interrupted her education for at least 3 years to raise a family\".",

    "summary": "Margaret C. \"Peg\" Snyder (born 1929) is an American social scientist with a special interest in women and economic development, particularly in Africa. She was the founding director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), whose name was changed to UN Women in 2011. She was also a co-founder of Women's World Banking and of the African Training and Research Centre for Women.\nSnyder was born in Syracuse, New York, in 1929. As a young woman, she attended the College of New Rochelle, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1950, and the Catholic University of America, where she received a master's degree in sociology in 1952. Her M.S. thesis at Catholic University was a study of potential effects of the proposal for an Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In 1953 she became dean of women for Le Moyne College in Syracuse, a position she held for eight years.\nA sabbatical-year in Africa in 1961 changed the course of her career. Invited by the Kenya African Women's Association to work with African women in Kenya, she initially assisted the \"Kennedy Airlifts\" that brought students to American colleges in preparation for Kenya independence in 1964. Kenya women, led by Margaret Kenyatta, daughter of Jomo who would be the nation's first President, then sought her assistance with planning a Kenya Women's Seminar to consult women from throughout the country about what roles women should play in an independent Kenya. After two national seminars, Tanganyika and Uganda were included in an East African Women's Seminar \nWhen her sabbatical year was over, Snyder decided to give up her position at Le Moyne in order to stay on in Africa, where, sponsored by the Women's Africa Committee, she would serve as an adviser to Umoja wa Wanawake wa Tanganyika (UWT) and continue her work with various groups in Kenya and Tanganyika. In 1965 she became assistant director for the Programme of Eastern African Studies of Syracuse University's Maxwell School, and was assigned as field director of their Ford Foundation assisted doctoral dissertation research on village settlements in Tanzania, with an opportunity to complete her own dissertation research there. She also worked as a consultant to the State University of New York, and for the American Council on Education.\nSnyder returned to Tanzania (the new name for the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar) in 1970 to complete her research while tutoring students. In 1971 she received a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. That same year she joined the United Nations (UN) staff as regional adviser for the Economic Commission for Africa in a post sponsored by the Swedish International Development Agency aimed to create an Africa- Regional Programme on Advancement of Women. In that position, she was responsible for the first data base of statistics on women to include an entire geographical region, for itinerant training courses for rural development workers from governments and NGOs, seminars on the creation of \"national machineries\" such as women's bureaux and national commissions on women, national bibliographies of writings about women, and other activities. She was a co-founder of ECA's African Training and Research Centre for Women, which was to become a model for similar women's programs worldwide, while she also served as first head of the Commission's Voluntary Agencies Bureau.\nIn 1978 Snyder accepted a position with the United Nations, New York, to be the first director of the Voluntary Fund for the UN Decade for Women (VFDW), later renamed the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). In that position she expanded the scope of her activities beyond Africa to include Asia, the Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean. UNIFEM started innovative and experimental programs aimed at improving women's situation and status throughout the world. Its major fields of concentration were economic and political empowerment. For example, it was the first to provide a large scale grant to the Green Belt Movement of Kenya, whose leader, Professor Wangari Maathai, would receive the Nobel Peace Prize. It financed training of women as labor leaders in Latin America, and silk producers in Asia.\nOnce programs such as these were evaluated as effective, many were adopted or replicated by major funds including the UNDP and the World Bank. Two types of activities pioneered by UNIFEM for the whole UN system were direct support to national non-governmental organizations rather than solely to governments, and creation of revolving loan funds owned by community groups. Initially administratively located in the Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs. VFDW moved as UNIFEM to autonomous association with the UN Development Program, UNDP, in 1985. It worked in cooperation with organizations such as UNICEF and UNDP in the UN system, non-governmental organizations and national governments of low income countries, and national development investment programs such as USAID, SIDA and Canadian CIDA. Its resources came entirely from voluntary contributions rather than from the assessed contributions of governments to the United Nations.\nUNIFEM faced two major obstacles during its initial decade under Snyder's leadership. Although units/programs directed to women's advancement were being established at national levels, the UN's institutionalizing the growing world concern for equity and justice for women through VFDW/UNIFEM was not yet fully understood by many senior UN and UNDP staff, who sought to move it away from UN headquarters and/or locate it at administratively low levels. The other major obstacle arose when some politicians successfully sought the withdrawal of the US government's annual contributions to its core resources (but not to those of its middle east project partner, UNICEF). Pressure from the Consultative Committee to the Fund, led by Therese Spens of UK, and from a group of NGOs, led to restoration of the US contribution, but at a lower level.\nSnyder retired from UNIFEM in 1989. Following her retirement, she continued to serve as senior advisor to the UN and United Nations Development Programme. In 1992-93 she was a visiting fellow at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and traveled worldwide to visit activities sponsored by UNIFEM a decade before, with grants from the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations. She wrote the histories of the African Training and Research Centre for Women at UNECA (with co-author Mary Tadesse) and of UNIFEM. She then received a Fulbright award to allow her to spend the 1994-95 academic year teaching at the newly established Women's Studies Programme for MA candidates at Makerere University in Uganda.\nIn late 2006, Snyder, her former UNIFEM colleague Dr Thelma Awori, and colleagues laid the foundations for the Sirleaf Market Women's Fund, that honors Africa's first elected woman President and assists Liberia to restore community markets and provide education and financial support to market women after 14 years of civil war. She is also a member of the Board of the Green Belt Movement International that supports Kenya's Green Belt Movement by sponsoring information activities and mobilizes resources for the work in Kenya. She was an International Election Observer in 1992 in Ethiopia; 1995 in Tanzania; 1996 in Uganda; and 2000 in Zanzibar.",

It was intended to educate military personnel about the cultural differences among the peoples of the world in preparation for their fighting with a variety of allies from other cultures. The authors stated that perceived differences between the races are cultural rather than biological.

He built the company into a successful venture, later famously selling it to the United Fruit Company giant in 1930 only to subsequently engineer a reverse takeover of sorts, serving as the latter's director in a profitable, if controversial, tenure from 1933 to 1952.\nIn 1917 Zemurray purchased and moved his family into a three-storey Beaux Arts mansion on St. Charles Avenue facing Tulane University, which would become the family home for the next four decades. In the early 1960s the mansion was transferred to Tulane where it became the residency of the University's presidents.\nDoris Zemurray attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she majored in anthropology, and also pursued graduate studies in archaeology.

Much of his work was done in partnership with his sister-in-law (Dorothy Bleek's aunt, Lucy Lloyd).

Her culminating work, published after death, was the book A Bushman Dictionary, still referenced today.\nLaurens van der Post, who liked to think of himself as \"a white Bushman\", credited her book Mantis and His Hunter (along with Specimens of Bushman Folklore by her father and aunt) as \"a sort of Stone Age Bible\". This is in the introduction to The Heart of the Hunter (1961), a follow-up to The Lost World of the Kalahari, the book based on the BBC series that brought the Bushmen to international attention.\nBleek's research and findings are often overshadowed by the work of her father, and she has been criticised for lacking the empathy and intuition of him and her aunt.

Her most recent works began as a study of symbolism of cherry blossoms and their viewing in relation to Japanese identities and led to an exploration of the cherry blossom symbol as a major trope utilized to both encourage and aestheticize sacrifice for the country during its military period.

She received her doctorate in linguistic anthropology from University of Texas at Austin and currently teaches at CIESAS-CDMX. She is the co-founder of Chatino Language Documentation Project.\nBorn in an indigenous community in Oaxaca, Mexico. Emiliana feels a responsibility both to her home community, that of the Chatino people of Oaxaca, and to her professional community of linguistic anthropology. The geographic focus of her research is Oaxaca. Though her training is predominantly in areas of grammar, sound, and word structure, with an emphasis on the linguistic features of tonal languages, her work draws together many areas of inquiry. It crosses the disciplinary boundaries of linguistic anthropology, cultural anthropology, indigenous studies, linguistics, education, and geography. In addition to her training in linguistic anthropology, she brings her native knowledge of Eastern Chatino, an Otomanguean language of Oaxaca, and a record of community engagement. The last has become an important aspect of her research, informing her purpose to bridge scholarly and community efforts toward documenting and preserving indigenous languages and linguistic practices. she is committed to the inclusion of indigenous communities in her research. In concrete terms, this has meant training speakers of indigenous languages in native language literacy and pedagogy.\nTone workshops:\nIn 2012, the first of three summer workshops was held. Each workshop lasted ten days. The three workshops were taught by eight linguists from Mexican and US institutions, including myself and two other University of Massachusetts professors: Anthony C. Woodbury (University of Texas), Francisco Arellanes (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico), Eric Campbell (University of California, Santa Barbara), Christian DiCanio (State University of New York at Buffalo), Mario Ch\u00e1vez Pe\u00f3n (Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropolog\u00eda Social), Alice C. Harris (University of Massachusetts), and John Kingston (University of Massachusetts).\nAt the workshop series, we provided Otomanguean speakers with the linguistic tools for analyzing the tonal systems of their languages. Each summer, they had fifty students from many major Otomanguean groups, including Zapotecs, Mazatecs, Mixtecs, Triquis, Chinantecs, Me\u2019phaas, Matlatzincas, and Chatinos. In the mornings, lectures covered the phonetics and phonology of tone, methods of tone discovery and analysis, and illustrative Otomanguean tone systems, while afternoons involved tutorials for students according to their level, followed by breakout gatherings for each of the language groups. The Chatino student group included speakers from seven Eastern Chatino varieties. The students were young people; most were literacy trainers in a federal program, the Instituto Nacional para la Educaci\u00f3n de los Adultos.\nThis was the first-ever workshop on tones for speakers of languages of the Otomanguean stock. Many of the students have continued to formally study the tonal systems of their native languages and some are producing pedagogical materials to teach with in local schools.\nPedagogical Material Workshop:\nPedagogical material workshop. She organized a three-year (2015-2018) workshop series for native speakers of Mexican indigenous languages. This series began in the summer of 2015 in Oaxaca City, on the topic of writing pedagogical grammars. This workshop was taught by Professor Luiz Amaral from the Hispanic Linguistics Program at the University of Massachusetts, who specializes in applied linguistics and language pedagogy. The making of pedagogical grammars in any language is a fundamental step toward scholarly research on that language. The workshop series therefore aims to promote dialogue between the fields of linguistics, indigenous studies, and anthropology to produce grammatical and cultural information useful for speaker communities and to support the right of every speaker to understand the linguistic structure of their own language.\nLanguage, landscape, and expressive culture:\nBy investigating the linguistic structure of Chatino has put put her in a position to study anthropological aspects of Chatino speaking communities. Her current research emphases are indigenous peoples\u2019 land rights, and the relationship between language and landscape, and connecting both to the documentation and revitalization of endangered languages. This project analyzes the connection between the linguistic and physical landscape of the municipality of San Juan Quiahije. This project also explores indigenous ways of talking about the land by telling the story of why, how, and to what extent elder speakers of Eastern Chatino transmit specialized vocabulary and related lexicons to their communities, which are encountering homogenizing influences. Further, it investigates language ideologies and practices as a way of engaging more general topics, such as the effects of Mexican state-building, local development initiatives, democracy, migration, and globalization on the ways Chatinos describe the land.",

She had studied with Franz Boas and was a specialist in the culture and history of the Pawnee people of the Midwest Plains. Her 1965 ethnography, The Lost Universe: Pawnee Life and Culture, is considered the authoritative work on Pawnee culture to this day.\nShe is also known for the 1943 pamphlet for the U.S. Army, called The Races of Mankind, which she co-wrote with Ruth Benedict. It was intended to educate military personnel about the cultural differences among the peoples of the world in preparation for their fighting with a variety of allies from other cultures. The authors stated that perceived differences between the races are cultural rather than biological. Among the data used in the text was an IQ study from World War I, which found higher scores among some northern Blacks in the United States forces than among some southern Whites. The pamphlet was not widely circulated within the Army, and by the early 1950s, it was banned as subversive.\nEngaged in social activism during the 1940s, Weltflish attracted the attention of the FBI, which suspected her (and others on the Left) of being a communist. In 1952 and 1953 she was called to Congress for questioning by two of the Senate sub-committees dedicated to investigating \"un-American activity\" during the 1950s red scare. Two weeks before appearing at a 1953 hearing, in which she refused to answer questions from staffer attorney Roy Cohn and Senator Joseph McCarthy as to whether she was a communist, her 16-year appointment at Columbia was terminated. She was blacklisted and unable to find an academic position for nearly a decade. During her last decade in academia full-time, she taught at Fairleigh Dickinson University.

Her fascination for archeology first started when she moved to Silver City, New Mexico, in 1906 with her husband Cornelius.\nIn 1919 the Cosgroves bought land in Grant County, New Mexico and began excavating Mimbres Valley ceramics. The Mimbres Valley has pre-Columbian culture dating from 200AD to 1150AD. The Cosgroves reportedly spent their free time exploring the Mimbres Valley with their son, Burton Cosgrove, Jr. In the 1920s the Cosgroves met Alfred Vincent Kidder (1885\u20131963), at the time curator of North American Archeology at Harvard's Peabody Museum. Kidder was extremely impressed with the Cosgroves' amateur archaeological work on Mimbres culture; the Cosgroves were later hired in 1924 by Harvard University\u2019s Peabody museum through the help of Kidder. Harriet was among the first women in the field of archeology to be professionally employed. She than began professionally excavating sites for the Harvard Peabody Museum, beginning with an expedition in the Mimbres Valley.\nThe Cosgroves\u2019 first professional archaeology endeavor was to excavate the Swarts Ruin, also known as the Swarts Ranch Ruin. The Swarts Ruin was part of the Mimbres Valley, however cultural artifacts of this area of the site suggest that the culture was only active between 1000AD \u2013 1150AD in that area. The Swarts excavation established the Cosgroves as elite Southwestern Archaeologists as well as solidifying their image as a team unit. The site was photographically documented by Cornelius and Harriet made ink drawings of every bowl excavated, totaling over 700 Swarts Ruin pots. In total, nearly 10,000 artifacts were found and chronologically recorded by season. Extremely thorough notes were also taken by Harriet pertaining to room locations on the site, dimensions of these rooms, and the floor\u2019s soil type; this was done for all burial sites discovered by the Cosgroves. The finds of the site were published in 1932 as \u201cThe Swarts Ruin: A Typical Mimbres Site in Southwestern New Mexico\u201d which detailed the findings from 1924\u20131927 by season. The excavation was deemed \u201cprodigious\u201d and is still used as the primary reference for Mimbres Scholars.\nA year prior to the Cosgroves\u2019 work at Stalling island they worked on the Gila River site in New Mexico from 1928\u20131929. After being hired by William Claflin, Jr. (an archeologist from Belmont, Massachusetts) the Cosgroves began work on the Stallings island Mound in Columbia County, Georgia. The site however was discovered to not be well preserved due to more recent aboriginal activity. A group of artifacts found at the site were termed the \u201cstallings island culture.\u201d The development of this idea of the culture allowed artifacts to be more accurately grouped by age, material, and groups of people. Cornelius discovered fiber-tempered pottery at the site as well as tools of late Archaic-type in great numbers. Through the work of the Cosgroves the Stalling Island Mound was found to be a shell heap rather than a major ceremonial construction like it was previously thought to be. Furthermore, the Cosgroves work at Stalling island was the first stratigraphic analysis of midden in Georgia.\nThe last site the Cosgroves worked on as a team was the Hopi Pueblo of Awatovi in Arizona. Burton Cosgrove died in 1936 during the first year of the project. Harriet returned to the site in 1937 and was placed in charge of the pottery tent on the site. She worked in training students and Indian assistants in the processes of washing, sorting, and cataloging the artifacts. In 1970 at the age of 84 Harriet Cosgrove died.",

Sancisi-Weerdenburg (23 May 1944, in Haarlem \u2013 28 May 2000, in Utrecht), was a Dutch ancient historian, specializing in classical Greek and Achaemenid history.\nSancisi-Weerdenburg began her studies in ancient history at the University of Leiden, graduating in 1967 to research under the supervision of Professor W. den Boer, a specialist in Greek history. For her doctoral thesis she set herself the task, which turned into a perennial theme, of trying to disentangle the complex realities of the Achaemenid Empire from the distorting web created by Greek literary conventions. To do this, she studied Old Persian, primarily on her own, and Iranian archaeology with Louis Vanden Berghe in Ghent. She received her doctor of letters in history and archaeology from Leiden University in 1980. Having taught first at the University of Groningen 1975\u201389, she achieved the Professorship in Ancient History at Utrecht in 1990. She was a pioneering scholar of ancient Greek history and Persian history. Her work stressed the importance of returning to the classical authors (including the Greek \u201cfather of history,\u201d Herodotus, and the Athenian playwright Aeschylus) with fresh critical awareness of the importance of reading them against the backdrop of subtexts and agendas embedded in their complex perceptions of the ancient Persian historys and their 200-year-long empire founded by Cyrus the Great.\nIn the historiography of the classical tradition and its modern elaborations, the ancient Achaemenid Persian peoples who fought with the Greeks in the so-called Persian Wars became the quintessential Other. Layers of assumptions of Western cultural primacy made it possible to take at face value the words of the Greeks, even when important cues within those sources, combined with primary evidence from the Persian vantage point, cried out for critical reappraisal. Sancisi-Weerdenburg systematically tackled an array of astutely targeted issues in Western traditions on the Achaemenid Persian empire\u2014including the notion of Decadence as a defining feature of ancient Persian kingship and the notion of the role of harem intrigue as the defining social maneuverability of women in the empire. The themes that became touchstones of the new historical agenda on the Persian empire spearheaded by Sancisi-Weerdenburg invariably resonated with concerns that invited engagement and energetic debate by a stimulating range of scholars.\nHeleen W.A.M.

From all of this follows that if we refuse to analyze the invasion that destroyed a civilized world and laid the seed of a system in which hunger, humiliation, and bloody repression constitute the only form of survivorship, contemporary underdevelopment should be a result of congenital incapacity, of the irremediable racial inferiority that justified extermination and vassalage.\n\nLater, her focus came to rest more and more on what to her was the embodiment of this Prehispanic 'utopia', Quetzalcoatl.\nDuring the 1950s, S\u00e9journ\u00e9 worked for Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). She did anthropological fieldwork in Oaxaca, but then changed to the field of archaeology, excavating at the pre-Spanish metropolis of Teotihuacan, which she believed was the legendary Tollan. She published several beautifully illustrated books on the art and architecture of Teotihuacan. Although she was the first to recognize the discontinuity between Teotihuacan and the much later Aztec civilization, her archaeological work has been subject to criticism.\nTo a wider public she became known through her 1957 publication on the cosmology and religion of the Toltecs and Aztecs, translated into English as Burning Water: Thought and Religion in Ancient Mexico. The book's main focus is the figure of Tollan's priestly king, Quetzalcoatl, and his teachings. Five years later, there was a follow-up in Quetzalcoatls' Universe (El Universo de Quetzalcoatl, 1962). Perhaps influenced by the ideas of Carl Jung, or by the historian of religion, Mircea Eliade, with whom S\u00e9journ\u00e9 maintained a correspondence, these books sketch a rather spiritualized image of king Quetzalcoatl and his legendary reign, referring to 'laws of interior preparation' supposedly left by the Toltec king and to advances 'along the road to spirituality' made possible by these.\nLaurette S\u00e9journ\u00e9's final years were dedicated to bringing education to the Indian peoples of the south of Mexico.

Their work on finger flutings was the first to show symbolic behavior by children in the Paleolithic through the creation of tectiforms in Rouffignac. Later work showed the role of women and children in the creation of cave art in Rouffignac. Their application of Zipf's Law from communications theory also gave the first replicable methodology for determining whether or not fluted panels represented purposeful communication or a proto form of writing.

The first woman to be appointed as a lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom, she worked at University College London (UCL) from 1898 to 1935. She served as President of the Folklore Society from 1953 to 1955, and published widely over the course of her career.\nBorn to a wealthy middle-class English family in Calcutta, British India, Murray divided her youth between India, Britain, and Germany, training as both a nurse and a social worker. Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with department head Flinders Petrie, who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her Junior Professor in 1898. In 1902\u201303 she took part in Petrie's excavations at Abydos, Egypt, there discovering the Osireion temple and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology. Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes and lectures at the British Museum and Manchester Museum, it was at the latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum-nakht, one of the mummies recovered from the Tomb of the Two Brothers \u2013 the first time that a woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy. Recognising that British Egyptomania reflected the existence of a widespread public interest in Ancient Egypt, Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience.\nMurray also became closely involved in the first-wave feminist movement, joining the Women's Social and Political Union and devoting much time to improving women's status at UCL. Unable to return to Egypt due to the First World War, she focused her research on the witch-cult hypothesis, the theory that the witch trials of Early Modern Christendom were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian, pagan religion devoted to a Horned God. Although later academically discredited, the theory gained widespread attention and proved a significant influence on the emerging new religious movement of Wicca. From 1921 to 1931 Murray undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on Malta and Menorca and developed her interest in folkloristics. Awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927, she was appointed assistant professor in 1928 and retired from UCL in 1935. That year she visited Palestine to aid Petrie's excavation of Tall al-Ajjul and in 1937 she led a small excavation at Petra in Jordan. Taking on the presidency of the Folklore Society in later life, she lectured at such institutions as the University of Cambridge and City Literary Institute, and continued to publish in an independent capacity until her death.\nMurray's work in Egyptology and archaeology was widely acclaimed and earned her the moniker of \"The Grand Old Woman of Egyptology\", although after her death many of her contributions to the field were overshadowed by those of Petrie. Conversely, Murray's work in folkloristics and the history of witchcraft has been academically discredited and her methods in these areas heavily criticised. The influence of her witch-cult theory in both religion and literature has been examined by various scholars, and she herself has been dubbed the \"Grandmother of Wicca\".",

She worked for five years for the Smithsonian Institution. In 1968 she moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, to begin doctoral work at the University of British Columbia, where she worked closely under the anthropologist Wilson Duff.\nHer 1973 Ph.D. thesis, The Tsimshian Crest System: A Study Based on Museum Specimens and the Marius Barbeau and William Beynon Field Notes, is considered an important early structuralist study of Northwest Coast culture. It was also the first monograph based on systematic and theoretically engaged analysis of the unpublished Barbeau-Beynon treasure-trove of ethnographic data, for which Duff had compiled a voluminous set of summaries.\nAlso in 1973, Halpin was appointed to UBC's anthropology faculty, where she served for the remainder of her career. She eventually became curator of the Northwest Coast collection at UBC's Museum of Anthropology, a collection which she helped bring to international prominence. In that capacity she worked closely with Northwest Coast artists such as Bill Reid and Robert Davidson.\nIn 1980 Halpin did fieldwork on Tsimshian personal naming practices in Hartley Bay, B.C., working with descendants of some of Beynon's informants.\nHer list of publications included a best-selling guide to totem poles, a well-known edited volume on the sasquatch, and an early study of Beynon's life and work.\nIn 1997, Halpin, with her colleague Margaret Seguin Anderson, did fieldwork in the Gitksan village of Gitsegukla, B.C. This was part of her process to realize a long-term ambition to publish Beynon's four volumes of fieldnotes from a 1945 totem pole-raising ceremony in that community. The resulting volume, with extensive commentary and new information, was published shortly before Halpin's death in 2000.\nAlso in the last year of her life, Halpin participated in a major Northwest Coast studies conference in Paris in honor of Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, a renowned French anthropologist. She was recognized for her pivotal role at the intersection of French structuralism and the study of Northwest Coast cultures.\nMarjorie Myers Halpin died August 30, 2000, of cancer, at her home in White Rock, B.C., at the age of 63.",

She was the daughter of a Tsimshian traditional healer and midwife named Mary Quintal (later Curtis) and French Canadian employee of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) fort in the village, Fran\u00e7ois Quintal. Following her mother in the matrilineal system of the Tsimshian, Odille was a member of the Gitlaan tribe and most likely of the Killerwhale crest. She grew up trilingual, in English, Tsimshian, and French, and also knew the Chinook Jargon trade language. When, in 1862, the Anglican lay missionary at Port Simpson, William Duncan, relocated a portion of his flock to found the nearby utopian Christian community of Metlakatla, the Quintals moved with him. Odille was educated in Metlakatla's mission school.\nIn August 1872 Odille, aged seventeen, married Charles F. Morison, an Englishman and a clerk with the HBC. They were married by a ship's chaplain because the missionary in charge, the Rev. Robert Tomlinson, for unknown reasons refused to marry them. The Morisons also kept a home in Port Essington, a cannery town whose founder, Robert Cunningham, had been Mary Quintal's brother-in-law.\nOdille waded into the doctrinal rivalry between Duncan and his Anglican bishop William Ridley by translating (against Duncan's instincts) sections of the New testament and prayer book into the Tsimshian language, Sm'algyax. Her work became the basis for the first practical spelling system of Tsimshian, the so-called \"Ridley orthography.\" Odille's partisanship in the Duncan-Ridley schism contributed to her decision to stay in \"Old\" Metlakatla when Duncan, in 1887, founded a new community at \"New\" Metlakatla, Alaska, with 800 Tsimshian settlers. She was entirely devoted to her extended Tsimshian family, who also remained behind.\nIn 1888 Odille met the anthropologist Franz Boas during his visit to Port Essington. He facilitated the publication of an article by Odille on Tsimshian proverbs for the Journal of American Folk-Lore in 1889 and over the next few years she gathered for Boas over 140 artifacts to be displayed at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, including two totem poles.

One of her more notable studies was that of the Haya land tenure:\n\nWe have examined the two forms of landholding and tenancy in the Haya system of land tenure. Although they co-exist, they have different bases, the one as an aspect of the traditional structure and the other as an aspect of the structure developing at the time of the study. The significance of each derives from the particular characteristics of Haya land which is valuable but limited in quantity. In the traditional structure, the land formed the base or medium through which the institution of clientship was expressed and some land is still held under this form of tenure. In the developing structure, the pressure on the land makes for heterogeneous arrangements, here considered under the rubric of the relatively new form of tenure.\n\nReining also pioneered and implicated the Landsat imagery technology in the field of anthropology and other social sciences.

Under Dr. Cardoso, Cebrap created Brazil\u2019s first research group on social movements, helping to legitimate formal academic study of the \"new\" (non-class) social movements that had emerged in the 1970s. At the same time, she was careful to stress the limits of identity-based and popular movements for political transformation, noting the divisions among them and their frequent dependency on clientelistic relations with the state and political parties.\nUnlike many academics, Dr. Cardoso also had the opportunity to put some of her theories into practice after her husband was elected president. She transformed the traditional charity approach of other first ladies with her Comunidade Solid\u00e1ria (Solidary Community) programs that stressed the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in state-society partnerships. In addition to executing concrete social programs, Comunidade Solid\u00e1ria also facilitated broad discussions of important social topics, from agrarian reform to the legal status of NGOs, publishing the results of these dialogues.

She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1919 with a bachelor's degree in English. She then attended the school's graduate program in anthropology, traveling to Europe on a science fellowship to do research. She was the first to discover Azilian remains in France, uncovering two at Montardit, Ari\u00e8ge.\nUpon her return to the United States, Wallis switched to the anthropology program at Columbia University under Franz Boas. She assisted in one of Boas's most famous studies, an examination of head circumference and changes in head shape among immigrants. She then began studying growth and anthropometrics of young children; her doctoral thesis on that topic \"remains a standard study widely quoted today\". She was hired by the anthropology department at the University of Iowa in 1930. She married Wilson Dallam Wallis, a professor of anthropology at the University of Minnesota, in 1931, and took an assistant professorship in sociology at Hamline University. Ruth was later dismissed because \"it was unthinkable to have two employed academics in one family during the Depression\". On behalf of the Bureau of Home Economics, she undertook the largest ever study of children's growth, which resulted in the standardization of sizing for children's clothes.\nDuring the Second World War, Wallis examined labor statistics for the War Manpower Commission and helped coordinate the Japanese Language and Culture Program for the Army. She also began writing mystery novels. She helped create an ethnography of the Micmac in Nova Scotia in the 1950s, and studied other native peoples in both Canada and the United States. After moving to Connecticut with her family, Ruth became a sociology lecturer at Annhurst College in 1956; she eventually became a full professor before retiring in 1974.",

She is particularly noted for her beliefs that the values of Chechen society have survived the wars. Bersanova, who has written several short stories, as well as a novel based on autobiographical experiences called The Road Home, was one of 35 Russian women nominated for the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize.\nZalpa Bersanova was born into the family of the famous Chechen writer Khozh-Akhmed Bersanov. As a child she wrote poems, fairy-tales and reports in local newspapers. She graduated from school with honors and her passion for history led her to the Department of History at the Chechen-Ingush State University. After graduation she worked as a school history teacher and later held the Chair of Philosophy of the Chechen State University. In 1989 she obtained a position of research fellow in the laboratory of sociology of the Chechen Research Institute of Social Sciences. Since then, she has undertaken research on the issues of the Chechen culture and mentality. In 1999 she presented her Ph.D. thesis at the Chair of Ethnology of Moscow State University.\nWhen the First Chechen War broke out in 1994, Bersanova was working on her Ph.D. thesis. The Chechen capital Grozny was being shelled and bombed by the Russian federal army and innocent civilians died in their homes and in the streets. Bersanova understood that she could not stand idly by. First she took part in the protest meetings, and then she began to write articles and books about the war. She realized that the war had resulted in the Chechen people suffering from deep moral trauma. Since then she has been researching for several years on the spiritual values of the present-day Chechens. Her findings argue that the Chechen people have a considerable positive potential even after the inhumane tragedy of war and that they maintain faith in the value of compassion and humanistic traditions.\nIn 1999 Bersanova presented her research in the lecture held in the Andrei Sakharov Museum in Moscow and in 2004 and 2005, she participated in a series of conferences in the United States, funded through the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, on the issues of war and peace. It was there that she conceived the idea of consolidating the efforts of all the researchers of the Chechen culture in order to help stop the violence. Together with her fellow researchers, Bersanova founded the International Center for Chechen Studies, striving to make the real face of the Chechen people and Chechnya's rich history and spiritual cultural achievements visible to the world.

In her early career, Hurston conducted anthropological and ethnographic research while attending Barnard College. While in New York she became a central figure of the Harlem Renaissance. Her short satires, drawing from the African-American experience and racial division, were published in anthologies such as The New Negro and Fire!! After moving back to Florida, Hurston published her literary anthropology on African-American folklore in North Florida, Mules and Men (1935) and her first three novels: Jonah's Gourd Vine (1934); Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937); and Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939). Also published during this time was Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica (1938), documenting her research on rituals in Jamaica and Haiti.\nHurston's works touched on the African-American experience and her struggles as an African-American woman. Her novels went relatively unrecognized by the literary world for decades, but interest revived after author Alice Walker published \"In Search of Zora Neale Hurston\" in the March 1975 issue of Ms. Magazine.
