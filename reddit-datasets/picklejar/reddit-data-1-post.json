Everyone was so encouraging and supportive, I really did not expect it! \n\nAfter making my post, I met with my boss in order to inform her that I needed a raise. She told me she would submit a pay raise request. \n\n1 week later she called me into her office. She absolutely berated me for thinking I could move into the coordinator position for which I was already doing the work, and complained about my work performance. Last month I had an evaluation, and received very high praise for my performance, and there has not ever been complaints about my performance in the past. All in all, I assume she was making excuses not to increase my pay. \n\nFast forward a bit, and I received a text from the wife of one of my boyfriend's friends, offering me a job at a rehab facility. I interviewed for the job, and they offered me the position at $20 an hour ($6 more an hour than my current job). \n\nIn the meantime, my boss called me into her office AGAIN, and informed me that I was VERY fortunate, as corporate had approved my pay increase. She stated that she \"truly shot for the stars when submitting my new pay\" and that corporate had \"gone above and beyond\" anything she ever thought I would receive: $17 an hour. Still $7 less than my coworker. \n\nI accepted the new job, and put in my two weeks notice. My boss was absolutely side swept. She could not believe that I was quitting. She waited a day, and called me into her office yet again, and asked me what they were offering me that was so great that I would choose to leave. I told her $20 an hour. \n\nShe said, \"If I can offer you that, will you stay?\" Wow. And here I thought $17 was above and beyond what they could ever offer me. \n\nI told her I would think about it. \n\nIn the meantime, I contacted my new employer and informed them that my current employer was offering to match their offer to keep me, and got an even bigger offer from them. \n\nI start next Monday!!\n\nThank you r/personalfinance for all your support and advice!

They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season.

It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\n**WHY VERIZON STORES?**\nThe new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\n**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**\nAjit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\n**HOW CAN I JOIN?**\n[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you.

We wanted to create an open platform for communities and their members to find and discuss the content they found most interesting. And today, that principle is exactly what net neutrality is all about: preserving an open internet with consumer choice and unimpeded access to information.\n\nNet neutrality ensures that the free market\u2014not big cable\u2014picks the winners and losers. This is a [bipartisan issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/6c2mzt/antinet_neutrality_is_everyones_problem/), and we at Reddit will continue to fight for it. We\u2019ve been here [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2sjkf0/join_us_in_a_final_push_for_net_neutrality_its_as/), and this time we\u2019re facing even worse odds.\n\nBut as we all know, you should never tell redditors the odds.\n\n### A level playing field\n\nNet neutrality gives new ideas, online businesses, and up-and-coming sites\u2014like Reddit was twelve years ago\u2014the opportunity to find an audience and grow on a level playing field. Saving net neutrality is crucial for the future of entrepreneurship in the digital age.\n\nWe weren\u2019t always in the [top ten most-viewed sites in the U.S.](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US) When Steve and I started Reddit right out of college, we were just two kids with $12K in funding and some computers in Medford, MA. Our plan was to make something people wanted, because we knew if we accomplished that, we could win\u2014even against massive incumbents. \n\nBut we wouldn\u2019t have succeeded if users had to pay extra to visit our website, or if better-funded alternatives loaded faster. Our start-up got to live the American dream thanks to the open internet, and I want to be able to tell aspiring entrepreneurs with a straight face that they can build the next Reddit. If we lose net neutrality, I can\u2019t tell them that.\n\n### We did it, Reddit, and we can do it again.\n\nYou all are capable of creating movements.\n\nI\u2019ve had a front-row seat to witness the power of Reddit communities to rally behind a common goal\u2014starting when you all named a whale [Mister Splashy Pants](https://www.ted.com/talks/alexis_ohanian_how_to_make_a_splash_in_social_media) in 2007. It\u2019s been heartening to watch your collective creativity and energy over the years; it\u2019s easy to take all these amazing moments of community and conversation for granted, but the thing that makes them all possible is the open internet, which unites redditors as an issue above all.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick recap:\n\n* In 2012, [we coordinated with mods to black out the website to protest SOPA &amp; PIPA](https://redditblog.com/2012/01/10/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all-depends/). They called these two bills \u201cinevitable\u201d in DC until America spoke up and they became \u201cunthinkable.\u201d\n* Then, [you all crowdfunded a bus we took through the heartland to support the open internet](http://www.adweek.com/digital/inside-reddits-internet-2012-bus-144244/). \n* Back in 2014, [you all rallied to deluge the FCC with thoughtful comments in support of net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/275mqp/reddit_there_are_only_45000_comments_on_the_fccs/), and [we collected your best comments for our own letter to the FCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2aohmu/reddit_is_filing_an_fcc_comment_to_fight_for_an/). \n* [You crowdfunded $20,000 to put up net neutrality ads across DC](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/13/5711012/net-neutrality-protest-posters-go-up-across-washington-ahead-of-fcc-vote).\n* In the span of a few hours, [you made over 15,000 phone calls to the FCC and your representatives](https://redditblog.com/2015/01/15/join-us-in-a-final-push-for-net-neutrality-its-as-easy-as-calling-858-wheeler/)!\n\nAnd all of this actually *worked*.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the U.S., because [redditors in India have used the site to defend net neutrality](https://redditblog.com/podcast/a-neutral-net-part-two/) and the CRTC (the Canadian equivalent of the FCC) [visited r/Canada for a thoughtful (and 99% upvoted!) discussion with citizens](https://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/54kz6g/im_from_the_crtc_and_we_want_to_know_what_you/). \n\nReddit is simply too large to ignore, and you all did all of this when we were just a fraction of the size we are today.\n\n### Time to get back to work\n\nWe\u2019re proud to join major internet companies like Amazon, Etsy, Twitter, and Netflix ([better late than never!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/06/15/netflix-joining-next-months-net-neutrality-protest-says-it-will-never-outgrow-the-fight/)) in today\u2019s Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality, orchestrated by Fight for the Future.

Today we\u2019re changing our logo and sharing a special message from Steve, our CEO, with every visitor to our front page to raise awareness and send people to **[BattleForTheNet.com](http://battleforthenet.com)**. Most exciting, [dozens of communities on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) (with millions of subscribers) across party lines and interest areas have joined the cause. If your community hasn\u2019t joined in yet, now\u2019s the time! (And you\u2019ll be in good company: u/Here_Comes_The_King is on our side.)\n\n*The FCC [is deciding this issue the way big cable and ISPs want it to](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/05/18/fcc-votes-to-start-rolling-back-landmark-net-neutrality-rules/?utm_term=.b7242cbf9cd1), so it\u2019s on us as citizens to tell them\u2014and our representatives in the Senate and House\u2014how important the open internet is to our economy, our society, and especially for when we\u2019re bored at work.*\n\nI invite everyone who cares about this across the internet to come talk about it with us on Reddit. Join the conversation, upvote stories about net neutrality\u2019s importance to keep them top of mind, [make a high-quality GIF or two](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/6gnyl4/giffing_for_net_neutrality/), and, most importantly, [contact the FCC](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) to let them know why *you* care about protecting the open internet.\n\nThis is how we win: when every elected official realizes how vital net neutrality is to all of their constituents.\n\n--Alexis\n\n**Comment on this post with why net neutrality is important to you!

It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\n**WHY VERIZON STORES?**\nThe new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\n**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**\nAjit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\n**HOW CAN I JOIN?**\n[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we\u2019ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can\u2019t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.", "subreddit": "listentothis", "total_awards_received": 0, "title": "The FCC is about to kill net neutrality.

This was the fourth time in the past three months they\u2019d decided to jack up the prices. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure where all that money was going, but at this point, they\u2019ve probably got enough to employ a small army.\u201d\n\nI turned to look at my door. Within the dark frame stood my sister. She made her way over rotting floorboards and piles of trash until I could make out her face in the pale glow of my monitor.\n\nI studied her ever-thinning frame, concerned that she wasn\u2019t getting enough food. We both knew, however, that she was getting all the food that she possibly could have. \n\n\u201cRachel, you don\u2019t look healthy,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get something into your system.\u201d\n\nIgnoring me completely, she said. \u201cI think this is another full raise. Didn\u2019t take them long to figure out that raising every website at once is going to fund their greedy habits much better.\u201d \n\nI turned back to the monitor, noting that the brightness was dimming slowly. I\u2019d have to pay soon or it\u2019s going to shut down. I looked back up to my sister\u2019s fragile frame, weighing my options. \n\nShe stared at me, puzzled. \u201cNathan, what are you doing? Pay the fee or it\u2019ll shut down the computer.\u201d \n\nFinally settling on my choice. I watched at the display slowly faded until we we\u2019re bathed in shadow. I precariously made my way to the light switch, once almost stepping on a jagged edge that would have sliced my decaying shoes to pieces. \n\nI flipped the switch. Nothing. \n\n\u201cThey shut the power off last week. We didn\u2019t pay the bill. You told me we could just use the computer lights.\u201d \n\nMy sister pulled a lighter out of her tattered pocket, and did her best to combat the darkness that had taken over the room. I looked at my surroundings. I hadn\u2019t left this room in weeks. Had the walls always been this shade of mold?\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go downstairs.\u201d I said to Rachel. When we arrived in what we once called our \u201ckitchen\u201d, she confronted me with my inaction as the computer faded. \n\n\u201cYou need to eat more. This week\u2019s computer wage is going to go into your stomach.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that hungry, I ate on Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cRachel, it\u2019s Friday night.\u201d\n\nEver shy in the face of confrontation, she backed off and sat on a small trash-less spot on the floor. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to walk to the store and find us something to eat, you stay there.\u201d I told her. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho would want to get in here anyways.\u201d she mumbled, but complied non-the-less. \n\nAfter a few hard pulls, the door came unstuck, replaced by a wall of humidity and heat. I was taken aback initially. It must\u2019ve been, what, four months since I left the house? Five? It\u2019s hard to keep track when the computer doesn\u2019t sleep.\n\nAs I hurried on the sidewalk, eager to end my errand as fast as possible, I saw the familiar glow of LEDs from just about every window on the block. Each house was falling apart, but at least they had their internet, right? \n\nIn the store, there was one attendant, who was nice enough to instruct me in where to find what I needed. The faster I get home, the better. I don\u2019t like being out here. \n\nAs I rounded the corner to my street, I saw lights from within my home. Shit, is someone raiding my setup? I rushed in to find my sister gagged and bound on her knees. Next to her were two men in riot gear. There was a third in front of them, clearly instructing them.\n\nAt the sound of the door they turned, and with a smile on his face, the head officer looked at me.\n\n\u201cAh, Nathan, is it?\u201d\n\nUnsure of what to say, I just stood there, groceries in hand, the outside  climate still breathing down my neck. \n\n\u201cIt says in your file that you\u2019ve stopped paying your internet bill. Is that true? That would be such a shame. It would mean we have to take you away.\u201d He said with a faux sadness in his voice. \n\nAngered at how he was treating my sister, I charged him, swinging the only thing i had at him as a weapon. There isn\u2019t much a can of meat can do against someone in kevlar except to annoy them. \n\nHe smirked at me, and then sent a left hook to my jaw that toppled me to the ground. Dazed, I tried to get to my sister as she screamed through her gag. The man planted his boot firmly on my back, pinning me to the rotting floor. \n\nHe leaned down and whispered in my ear, an audible smirk in his voice.\n\n\u201cNo one can live without the internet, Nathan.\u201d\n\n[battleforthenet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com)", "subreddit": "nosleep", "total_awards_received": 0, "title": "Net Neutrality", "subreddit_subscribers": 0}, {"author": "ewilliam", "created_utc": 1527609482, "score": 87876, "selftext": "", "subreddit": "creepy", "total_awards_received": 0, "title": "A friend went for a walk the other night and saw this woman just standing on a roof", "subreddit_subscribers": 12213312}, {"author": "inbodymassalone_", "created_utc": 1484969454, "score": 82122, "selftext": "", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "total_awards_received": 0, "title": "This can never go away, this needs to continue to get posted over and over and over again.

This post does not represent a change in that policy, but rather that we feel the issue of Net Neutrality is so incredibly important to our community and to the world of fitness that we are willing to make an exception to something we have historically been extremely strict and uncompromising about.\n\nConsider some of the popular and highly regarded sources of fitness information that we have today. People like (in no particular order): Greg Nuckols, Alan Thrall, Mark Rippetoe, Jeff Cavaliere/Athlean-X, Cody LeFever/GZCL, our own u/MythicalStrength, Omar Isuf, Mark Bell, Jam Wandler, Brian Alsruhe, Jonnie Candito, Layne Norton, Chris Duffin, Ben Pollack, Megsquats, Eric Cressey, Brad Schoenfeld, Mike Israetel, Bradley Martin, Chad Wesley Smith, Joe DeFranco, Marisa Inda, Janae Marie Kroc. Websites like Strength and Conditioning Research, Examine, Juggernaut Training Systems, EliteFTS, Rogue, Muscle and Strength, BodyBuilding.com, T-Nation, Body Recomposition, Keto Gains, MyFitnessPal, Sci-Fit, Starting Strongman, ExRx, and all the disparate fitness sub-Reddits.\n\nNow imagine a world where the telecom company that owns your ISP has seen that there's money to be made if they jump into the fitness market, and they've decided to launch their own Daily Workouts service, so they throttle or block your internet traffic when you go to watch some of the most popular fitness channels on YouTube, and *there is nothing you can do about it*. What they are doing has been made completely legal. You cannot speak with your money because you have either no other choices in ISP in your region, significantly worse choices in service, or your other choices are owned by a *different* telecom juggernaut that is doing exactly the same thing.\n\nImagine a world where Greg Nuckols can be legally forced to pay Comcast so that their customers can access StrengTheory unimpeded, and so he must either start charging, run intrusive ads, or shut down. Replace \"Greg Nuckols\" with anyone you care to name.\n\nThink that can't happen? [They've already tried. Repeatedly.](http://archive.is/y8e4H) The only thing that stopped them was the FCC - The same FCC whose chairman now wants to dismantle everything that stopped them from becoming this generation's Robber Barons.\n\nThe Internet facilitates the exchange of information between individuals in a way that has revolutionized fitness. It has provided athletes and coaches with a platform to connect with and share high quality training methodology with more people than ever in history. It has lowered the barrier to finding  training and nutrition information. It has helped uncountable numbers of fitness enthusiasts of all levels of experience to learn how to achieve their goals. It has lowered the financial barrier to pursuing fitness by spreading information that dispels myths about snake oil supplements, over-marketed fitness programs, and unethical industry practices. Though there is a dark side to that coin as well, the list of positives and benefits is enormous and their value cannot be overstated.\n\nIt is because of the importance of Net Neutrality to the entire world of fitness that we are making an exception to our normal practices for this post. Everything that can be done to protect Net Neutrality **must** be done.\n\n**We strongly urge everyone within the sound of our voice to contact their Congressmen and Congresswomen to tell them of the importance of Net Neutrality.** The internet is famous in recent years for \"slacktivism\", but this issue is too important to simply share things on social media. I, personally, have already called my representatives and will be hand writing letters to everyone who is relevant later today.\n\nThis website is currently making the rounds and will help you take what action you can: www.battleforthenet.com", "subreddit": "Fitness", "total_awards_received": 0, "title": "Net Neutrality - A serious issue that cannot be ignored", "subreddit_subscribers": 0}, {"author": "VictorJ45", "created_utc": 1569268311, "score": 152157, "selftext": "", "subreddit": "wholesomememes", "total_awards_received": 0, "title": "What a considerate man", "subreddit_subscribers": 5362627}, {"author": "profeta-", "created_utc": 1563207428, "score": 91341, "selftext": "", "subreddit": "WTF", "total_awards_received": 0, "title": "Annoyed by loud music, man uses drone to hit neighbors with fireworks", "subreddit_subscribers": 5747274}, {"author": "SQUEEEEEEEEEPS", "created_utc": 1494882202, "score": 98337, "selftext": "", "subreddit": "politics", "total_awards_received": 0, "title": "Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian foreign minister and ambassador.", "subreddit_subscribers": 0}, {"author": "Particle_Man_Prime", "created_utc": 1533399193, "score": 82237, "selftext": "", "subreddit": "bestof", "total_awards_received": 0, "title": "Student is frantically on Reddit trying to get attention to the fact that his friends are being raped and murdered by his government.", "subreddit_subscribers": 4898728}, {"author": "britweins", "created_utc": 1550792992, "score": 148453, "selftext": "", "subreddit": "interestingasfuck", "total_awards_received": 0, "title": "Im the girl from the \"giant\" wolf post.

So I ditched the online dating and just...talked to lots of people. It was kinda awkward at first, but once I mustered up the balls to say hi, I found that people actually enjoyed talking to me. Even if it was cold like on the street or on the bus. I started to feel good and somehow women even started to approach *me*.\n\n\nEventually I asked women out and their responses were well, pleasant. Even if they said no, they were really flattered. Some said they *would* say yes but they have a BF ( I hope they didn't tell their BF that). We would share a laugh and we still say hi on the street. The takeaway is I spent a lot of my life waiting for the opportunity, but realized that women liked to be talked to and asked out as much as I do.\n\n\nOn my 4th or 5th girl, I got a yes and we had a 1st date. It was really nice and we're going on a 2nd one soon. It's really exciting for me. Even if it doesn't work out, it gives me hope for the future. \n\n\nYou don't know who I am and probably don't care, but I just want people to know your advice helped me during a time I was pretty sad and butthurt. Thanks :)\n\n**tl;dr:** Couldn't get a date, frustrated. You gave me advice. Realized women wait and like to be asked out.
