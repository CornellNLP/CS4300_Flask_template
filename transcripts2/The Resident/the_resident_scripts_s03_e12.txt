 Previously on The Resident... Today is the day we introduce 3B Life to the American public. 
 It's only a matter of time before the board realizes that you swiped an opportunity from underneath them. 
 What do you want? A healthy percentage of our growing supplement business. 
 I loved my sister very much. 
 The grief and guilt consumed me. 
 Emotions can enrich our lives, but they can also destroy us. 
 I want you to be my baby's godmother. 
 There was only one person I wanted to hear me speak, so I imagined that person was there. 
 Dr. Pravesh, have you ever saved a princess before? 
 You're fired. I don't know who I am right now. 
 I don't know who I'll be if I can't be a doctor anymore. 
 _ 
 Mina, these intervals look good to me. 
 Second opinion? Agree. QT isn't prolonged. 
 Great. Azithromycin it is. 
 I am writing you a prescription for five days of an antibiotic. 
 You can pick it up at the mobile pharmacy outside. 
 How many people have you seen? 18 or 19. 
 We have to see them faster. I just looked outside... the line's even longer than when we got here. 
 Where are they all coming from? 
 Mountains, remote farms, towns. 
 It's a medical dead zone for miles. 
 No hospital anywhere nearby. 
 It's hard to believe we're only three hours outside of Atlanta. 
 But here we are. 
 I wheeze all the time. 
 Show us how you use your inhaler. 
 Let me teach you how to do that the right way. 
 No more spinning. Thank you, that... is that like some kind of yoga or tai chi or something? 
 You're like some sort of guru. 
 Yeah. 
 They were able to make your glasses. 
 I can read the sign. 
 How do I look? Perfect. 
 That baby took a three-hour nap? 
 You have to tell me how to make her do that at night. 
 Thank you. I'm going to propose to my new nanny. 
 Not what I expected. Um, why isn't Conrad here? 
 Do not tell him I said this, but... 
 I miss seeing his face at Chastain. 
 I know. Me too. 
 But Search & Rescue just called him for a last-minute mission. So... 
 Oh. 
 Search & Rescue, that's very funny. 
 It's not for you. 
 We found a lost kid up in Sweetwater. Oh, right. Your volunteer work. 
 Nic's volunteer work. My volunteer work. 
 We're all volunteers. 
 Uh... 
 Look, I'm sorry about all this. 
 I-I just... I didn't see the "no parking" sign, it's-it's stupid, and I got a ride share app on my phone, but now my credit card doesn't work, I... Well... 
 Family, no apologies. Come on. I'll get you home. 
 Ah, this is my patient. Hold on. 
 Hello? 
 Dr. Hawkins, it's Archer Loggins. 
 I wanted to thank you. 
 You've helped me and Adelaide so much these past couple years. 
 Well, that's my job, Archer. 
 Is everything okay? 
 You'll stay on as Adelaide's doctor, right? 
 Keep an eye on her? Of course. 
 Why you asking me that? Oh, uh, no reason. No reason at all. 
 Just take care of her. 
 I know she's in good hands. 
 Thank you for all you've done. 
 Archer, what's going on? 
 Where are you right now? 
 This is Archer Loggins. 
 Leave a message. 
 Is everything all right? 
 I think my patient might hurt himself. 
 We have to go check on him. Let's go. 
 Oh. Well, look at that. I didn't know doctors still made house calls. 
 I got your address from a friend in medical records. 
 I hope that's okay. 
 Oh, sure. Archer called me, he didn't sound like himself, Adelaide. 
 Can I come in and speak with him? I want to make sure he's okay. 
 Of course. He's taking a little nap. 
 The MS makes him tired. 
 Hi, Kyle Nevin. Chastain angel. Come on in. 
 Pleasure to meet you. 
 Archer, hon? I have Dr. Hawkins here. 
 He wants to say hello. 
 Why is this door locked? 
 Archer, open the door. 
 We've never locked that door. Archer, answer me. 
 We need to break in and check on him, okay? 
 No. No, no, no, no... It's okay. 
 It's okay, Archer. What did you take? 
 Call 911. Tell them we have attempted suicide by overdose. 
 The pills, Archer. I see oxycodone. I didn't take any yet. 
 I swear. Archer... 
 I got sneezed on. Twice. 
 And I'm 70% certain that the puddle I just stepped in was not water. 
 Oh, it's the ER. The puddle is never water. 
 Embrace the gross. 
 Dr. Pravesh. 
 Nadine. 
 It's good to see you again. Wh... 
 What happened here? I'm, like, the third Emory DJ with one of these. 
 Someone set up a new overhead shelf in the sound booth. 
 I stood up too fast, forgot it was there. Bonk. 
 Did you lose consciousness? 
 Any, uh, changes in vision, confusion? 
 Mm-mmm. 
 A head bonk brought you to the ER? 
 With your medical history, it was smart of you to come in. 
 Nadine was recently diagnosed with moyamoya and had a cerebral bypass. 
 Okay. Look straight ahead for me. 
 Pupils equal, round and reactive. 
 Follow my finger. 
 So far everything looks fine. 
 She doesn't even need stitches. 
 Nadine, does your head hurt? 
 No, but could you admit me overnight? 
 To be safe? 
 Why don't we start by letting Dr. Dreyfuss finish your exam, and you staying in the ER a little while for observation? 
 Great. 
 Then I can spend the day observing you. 
 Um... okay, but there might not be anything interesting to observe. I'm just... 
 Well, I mean, there's that guy. 
 Andrea. Hey. 
 So, what do you got there? Samples of our new supplement. 
 And since Chastain is a partner, they're letting me set up a display. 
 Andrea. Hey. 
 I didn't think we were setting up the 3B displays today. 
 I know. The supplements came in earlier than I thought, so... surprise. 
 Sweet Mother of God. 
 Y'all were on that STV program. 
 And you are more dashing in person, if it's even possible. 
 I swear, I saw that handsome face come across my TV, and the next thing I know, $30 disappeared right out of my checkbook. 
 Can I get a picture? Oh, sure. 
 You don't mind, do you, hon? 
 'Course not. 
 The ladies at the book club are gonna flip. 
 Cheese. 
 The ambulance is on its way. I-I don't need an ambulance. 
 I didn't take any of the pills. Archer, this is an interrupted suicide attempt. 
 Legally, you need a full psych evaluation. 
 I never should have had the surgery. 
 You have MS. You fell and fractured your spine. 
 You were in pain. You needed the operation. 
 But the bills. 
 The cost... it... it's catastrophic. 
 Too young for Medicare, too much money for Medicaid, and our insurance deductible is... so high. 
 We're already maxed out on what we can pay. 
 And then, after the surgery, this arrived. 
 Chastain used an out-of-network anesthesiologist who charged $15,000? 
 Did Chastain make you aware of the out-of-network cost? 
 No. But we thought that it was a mistake. 
 We couldn't pay that, so Red Rock sued us. 
 What now? W-We go bankrupt? And now my wife is going to be homeless because of me. Shh. 
 No, no. Come on, Arch. Don't... 
 You are not ending up on the street. 
 I have life insurance. 
 Archer... Enough to cover all of this. 
 I would rather live in a shack with you by my side. 
 Uh, the ambulance is here. 
 No, I'm not gonna go. 
 Who's gonna pay for that ambulance? 
 We've known each other a long time... you know I'll do everything in my power to help. 
 But right now we need to get you to the hospital, and that is nonnegotiable, my friend. 
 Hey. Keep an eye him. 
 Hey, Jen. 
 No meds. No restraints. 
 He'll come out willingly. You just... 
 What happened? He had a gun in the drawer. 
 He pulled it out. He pointed it at his head. 
 I tried to grab it from him, and it went off, and it hit him in the stomach. Adelaide, put pressure here. 
 Kyle, grab his legs. What? 
 Grab his legs. Where are the paramedics? 
 After gunfire, they can't come in until the police get here... that's the law, so we go to them. Let's go. 
 Let me guess, you've been taking unregulated colloidal silver supplements. 
 For how long? 
 Uh, over a year. 
 Well, that's why you're blue. 
 It's called argyria. 
 It's rare but it happens. 
 When did your skin start to change? 
 Uh, it was a while ago. 
 It started off a little light gray, but then it just kept going from there. 
 You know, I read an article that said it would cure everything. 
 What needed to be cured? 
 Exhaustion. Sore joints. 
 The silver was supposed to scrub all the toxins from my blood, but... this morning I could barely crawl out of bed. 
 Well, we'll start by running some tests, okay? 
 Just curious: when you first went from gray to blue, you didn't think, "I might have a bit of a problem here"? 
 No. I thought it was cool. 
 Andrea Braydon. 
 Uh, Dr. AJ Austin. 
 Cardio-thoracic surgery. 
 Why do doctors always name-check their specialty... is it so people will know how important you are? 
 Well, this job is an extension of our personality, so it just seems natural to mention it. 
 And yes, it's so people will know how important we are. 
 What you got there? 
 Uh, 3B Life. It is a revolutionary dietary herbal and energy supplement. 
 Of course. So you are Bell and Cain's new partner. 
 They're the new partners. I'm the founder. 
 So now who needs to feel important? 
 You want a sample? 
 My supplement can decrease your risk of heart attack. 
 Oh, my heart is a specimen. 
 Improve your mental acuity. 
 My mind is at the top of its game. 
 Increase your stamina. 
 Please. 
 Okay, right. 
 Tell you what, if you change your mind, give me a call, I'll hook you up. 
 And if you don't change your mind... you should still call me. 
 Okay. 
 Unless you're spoken for. 
 Thanks. 
 Oh, my God. I don't want to be here. Come on. 
 You know what, I said I didn't want to go. Come on, come on. We're coming. 
 And besides... Come on. Joyce! 
 Last ones. You two are lucky you made it in time. Mm. 
 Four hours of back roads, and with that one driving, we're lucky we didn't fly off the mountain. 
 Stop it. So, which one of you is Joyce? 
 That one. I'm Bianca, but this isn't about me. 
 My sister hasn't seen a doctor in years. 
 If it ain't broke, don't fix it. All right. 
 Well, let's check you out. 
 Deep breath in. 
 Lungs sound clear. 
 Mm-hmm. Told you. 
 What's that? 
 That is a ventricular assist device. 
 Yeah. That's my VAD right there. 
 When my own heart went to crap five years ago, they cut me open and put it in. 
 This powers the machine inside me so it can pump blood. 
 You know, like hearts do when they're not crap. 
 I'm basically a battery-operated woman. 
 Saved my life. 
 Why is it beeping? 
 Oh, must need a battery change. 
 Hold tight. I'll find 'em. 
 No, you won't. 
 They're on the counter at home. 
 I... told you to put 'em in the bag. 
 Wh-Where's your hand pump? 
 That's at home, too. 
 Where's the nearest drugstore? 
 I can run out and grab batteries. 
 A drugstore won't carry that kind of battery. 
 We need a hospital or the device manufacturer. 
 I'll call Life Flight, see if they can arrange a chopper. 
 Maybe a local VAD patient has an extra. 
 What-what if Bianca's battery runs out? 
 Then I die. 
 Two VAD patients in the area... neither are answering their phone, and Life Flight doesn't have a free chopper. 
 The manufacturer has batteries, but they're not local and can't get them here in time. 
 The nearest hospital is Chastain, three hours away. 
 So this woman will die because we're too far from a friggin' battery? 
 Don't forget the portable ultrasound. 
 Already in with the VAD batteries. 
 Go. I'll text you the coordinates of the clinic van... with any luck, you'll meet them there halfway. 
 So if we don't hit any red lights... You'll have a chance to get the new batteries into your patient before she dies. 
 And, Mina... Ready? 
 Okay, we're leaving. Thank you. 
 Drive safely. 
 Whoa, whoa. Uh, you ever get any speeding tickets? 
 No. Then I'm driving. 
 Gunshot wound in the abdomen. 
 80/50. Heartrate: 140. 
 We got to get him to the O.R. 
 You know we have to take this from here, right? 
 Hey. We got him. 
 I promise. 
 Dr. Hawkins, please go with him. You're his doctor. 
 I can't. 
 Wow, look who's back. 
 Oh, you look great. Oh, thank you. 
 Oh. 
 My hair's still growing back, so hence the wig. 
 Oh. Yeah, but at least I'm clear for work, in theory. 
 Well, Chastain's made a few changes. 
 There are two new scrub nurses. We're looking for a third. 
 So you won't be working any more double shifts. 
 Yeah. Doesn't look like I'll be working at all. 
 I'm not on any surgeon's schedule. 
 Well, word probably hasn't gotten around that you're back. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Or... your colleagues just want to ease you in. 
 Or... no one trusts me in an operating room, because my brain is, um... 
 Oh, like in a-a skillet, a-an egg... 
 Your brain is not fried. 
 Yeah. That's normal. 
 You're gonna have trouble finding words for a while. 
 You're recovering from major surgery. 
 Do you have any trouble understanding words that are spoken to you? 
 No. 
 Then you are ready. 
 And you'll be with me today. Put her in six. 
 No. No, no, no. You don't have to do that just to be nice. 
 Ask around. 
 Nobody's ever accused me of being nice. 
 I'll see you in the O.R. 
 Bowel is torn to shreds. 
 Mm, close-range bullet. No surprises there. 
 Lap pad. 
 At least no major vessels were hit. 
 Lucky guy. 
 So you thinking colostomy here, or... 
 Oh, I hope not. That'd be a disaster for this man. 
 He already has MS. That's enough to deal with without a colostomy bag. 
 Do you need the... 
 Retractor. 
 Yes. Perfect. 
 Why couldn't Dr. Hawkins go with Archer? 
 Because he doesn't work here anymore. 
 He doesn't? Why not? 
 The hospital let him go. 
 People are very upset. 
 They've got to be insane. 
 When do we hear from the surgeon? 
 As soon as the operation is over. 
 I don't understand... how this happened. 
 How could I not see that he was planning this? 
 What kind of wife am I? 
 Adelaide, I... 
 I-I don't know your husband. 
 But I do know one thing. 
 You didn't see any of this because Archer didn't want you to see it. 
 We always told each other everything. 
 He was protecting you because he loves you. 
 And he blames himself for all this trouble that you're both in, and... 
 So he feels ashamed. 
 I'm sure that he's been racking his brain trying to find any way out of this, any way to live out his life with you and... still make sure that you're safe. 
 But he just couldn't find any other answer. 
 Any way to save the person that he loves... and stop being a burden. 
 If someone is desperate enough... the worst solution in the world starts to look like a pretty damn good thing. 
 Says take a left here. Now. 
 I-It's louder. Wh-Why is it doing that? 
 That's the VAD system telling us that more battery has drained. 
 How much longer do I have? 
 15 minutes. 
 Maybe half an hour. 
 Then it will go to the backup battery, and another 15 minutes. Where's the ambulance? 
 It's saying we're still 52 minutes apart. 
 If we both go faster, we can still make it together in time. 
 This is my fault. 
 I didn't need to see a doctor. 
 Stop that. They're my batteries. 
 They're my responsibility. 
 I forgot 'em, and... here we are. 
 Pay attention, Joyce. 
 Social security numbers. 
 Bank account passwords. 
 Um, the combo for the lock on my bike. 
 I know nobody rides it, but just in case. 
 In the left-hand drawer in the laundry room are the appliance warranties and also the instructions for the remote control. 
 I guess you get to watch your game shows every night after all. 
 Joyce. 
 All this time... your heart, the batteries. 
 I thought I was taking care of you. 
 But you've been taking care of me. 
 We've been taking care of each other. 
 All right, here's where I keep the gold. 
 Wha... Gold? 
 I'm kidding. But I do have that jar of pennies in the pantry. 
 The ambulance that's meeting us better have its sirens on. 
 Can I have a word? 
 Absolutely. 
 I need to tell you something. It's a little awkward. 
 Randolph Bell. 
 Used to be CEO, now he's not. 
 Used to be chief of surgery. That's all done. 
 The guy can get his hands on the ball, but he can't keep it in the air. 
 That hasn't been my impression. 
 What's your point? Don't get me wrong, Bell's a decent salesman, and the company will be fine, but... it could be more than fine. 
 I can help increase revenues exponentially through better marketing. 
 You shouldn't have to waste your valuable time with that penny-ante stuff. 
 I'm having dinner tonight with an investor from a major advertising firm. 
 You should join us. 
 Sounds promising. Count me in. 
 I'll do that. 
 Adelaide said you were out here. 
 The surgery was a success. 
 We repaired enough of the bowel, he won't need an ostomy. 
 So he will recover. 
 Well, there's no cure for the MS. 
 And he'll need treatment for his suicidal depression. 
 He won't be able to pay for any of that. 
 Do you know why he shot himself? 
 No, I don't. Mm. 
 Chastain billed him for an out-of-network anesthesiologist and then added on over 100,000 in unspecified charges that his insurance can't pay. 
 And then, just to kick him while he's down, Red Rock sued him. 
 I won't bill for my surgery today, and... 
 Thank you. That's a start. 
 And as for the rest of it, I'll see what I can do. 
 You know, what Red Rock did to you was not right. 
 Well, they haven't treated you so well, either. 
 What can I do for you? 
 Archer's my patient, and I'm not even allowed to see him. 
 Nothing's filling that void. 
 Where's the ambulance now? 
 It's been in the same place for three minutes. Traffic, maybe? 
 We're still 30 minutes away. 
 It says "backup battery mode". 
 No! No, no, no. It's okay. 
 That means 15 minutes left. Keep driving. Joyce... 
 Drive faster. Joyce! 
 I got five years out of this machine. 
 Bonus years I wouldn't have had if it hadn't been for you taking care of me through the operation, and after. 
 They were good years. 
 Thank you. 
 Pull over. 
 We still might be able to reach them in time. 
 Math says we won't. Pull over. 
 Bianca, we are not giving up on you. 
 Everyone in this van knows the same thing: it's over. 
 You know where I don't want to die? 
 The back seat of a van. 
 When I go out of this world, it's gonna be under the blue sky with the sun on my face. 
 With my sister. 
 Clara's down the road. 
 She'll wave down the ambulance that's carrying the battery. 
 Be straight with me. This is it. 
 We all know it can't get here in time. 
 There's still a chance. 
 Nic, listen. 
 I don't want any heroics. 
 No CPR that could break my ribs. 
 I promise. 
 Thank you. 
 What'll it be like when it happens? 
 Uh... well, the... the battery will stop, and, um, you might feel a little dizzy. 
 And then you'll close your eyes and... it will feel like falling asleep. 
 That's good. 
 Peaceful. 
 That's how I want it. 
 We know you did everything you could. 
 Now, shoo. 
 I want to do my dying alone... with my sister. 
 I love you so much. 
 The battery's less than ten miles away. 
 That's too far. So we keep her alive until it comes. 
 
 
 
 We can't do that. We can. If she's not down for long... 
 Mina, stop. 
 She doesn't want a violent death. 
 Jessie. 
 That moment outside her room... when it was happening and there was nothing I could do. 
 At least this... 
 we can let Bianca go the way she wants. 
 That we can do. 
 It's slowing down. 
 Battery's running out. 
 I'm glad it's sunny today. 
 It's pretty. 
 Quiet. 
 She gets to hold her sister's hand... while she dies. 
 At least they have that. 
 Uh... 
 I'm actually not dead at all. 
 She's alive! 
 Oh... Oh, my God. 
 My heart's beating. 
 What? Well, that's different. 
 I'm definitely not dead. 
 Well, unless this is... 
 No, this can't be Heaven. 
 I mean, it's nice here, but there should be, like, a river of ice cream and a field of roses and Chris Pine. 
 Her pulse is strong and regular. 
 The VAD must have given her heart time to repair. 
 Now that the VAD stopped, her heart is working again. 
 How you feeling? 
 Let me guess: method actor prepping for his Blue Man Group audition. 
 Ooh! Smurf superfan. 
 Patient information is private. 
 I'm so tired of rules. 
 Nadine, what's really going on? 
 I hit my head. That was real. 
 But when I got here, I was happy to see you. 
 You probably think this is silly, but... most people act all weird because I'm a princess. 
 With a guard always around, I'm never alone, but... 
 But you're always lonely. 
 You understand me. 
 I still can't keep you here overnight. 
 But... maybe there's something we can do. 
 To be clear, now that I'm not dead, I take back that thing I said about your game shows. 
 I can live with that. 
 Cardiac function is sufficient. 
 Did I even need the VAD in the first place? 
 Yeah. The VAD saved your life. 
 And then once it was in you, it gave your heart enough time to heal. 
 If that battery hadn't run out, we never would have known. 
 Now that there's no blood running through the VAD, it's clotting. 
 We need to get her to Chastain now. 
 Get the gurney. I'm gonna call ahead to book an O.R. 
 What's wrong? We need to get the VAD out. 
 There's a clot, and if it dislodges, it could be bad. 
 You mean my sister could die? 
 This time for real. 
 The gunshot guy was exciting, sure, but five people with sniffles, a princess looking for love, and a blue guy who caused his own problems... 
 I mean, come on. 
 Wait, why are we out here? 
 Seems like you need a break from the E.R. 
 Tell me, Ezra, why do you want to go into anesthesiology after intern year? 
 Fascinating physiology. High stakes. 
 Life and death every day. 
 What else? 
 To be honest, great hours. 
 And I like patients who can't talk because they're asleep. 
 Do you have OCD, Ezra? 
 What? No, I do not. 
 That's absurd. 
 I've seen you pick at your buttons, double-check your stethoscope's in your pocket, check your phone a billion times. 
 Fine, I-I'm... I'm a control freak, okay? 
 I also check the lock on my door ten times before bed. 
 I buy pillowcases in bulk because I need a fresh one every day. 
 I get up in the middle of the night to make sure the stove is really off. 
 But that's because I'm super careful. 
 If you're an anesthesiologist, that's a virtue, because you can't make a single mistake. 
 I respect super careful. 
 So why don't you take another look at Blue Billy's scans. 
 Fusion of the vertebral bodies. 
 Bamboo spine. 
 Mix with long-term chronic aches and pains, you get? 
 Ankylosing spondylitis. 
 An autoimmune disease. Very treatable. 
 Ezra... the desire for perfection, checking things again and again... all your patients need that. 
 Let's go give Blue Billy the news. 
 It's a manageable condition. 
 We'll get you set up with a specialist, and your pain will be under control in no time. 
 And everyone said the pain was in my head. 
 It's why I took the silver. 
 Hey. How long before the blue fades away? 
 Um... never. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Awesome. 
 Eh. 
 I've put in hundreds of VADs, but I've never taken one out for this reason. 
 Hmm. 
 Bianca's ventricle is clear. 
 Now I will repair it. 
 Pledgeted Prolene. 
 It's funny. 
 The liver is the only organ that can regenerate itself, but the heart... it can repair. 
 Evolve. 
 Adapt to meet its circumstances. 
 You're poetic today. 
 Yeah. 
 I guess I am. 
 Ready to take her off bypass. 
 Let's see how she does on her own, shall we? 
 Hmm. 
 Her heart is strong and healthy. 
 All on her own. 
 And yet another Hollywood ending to an Austin-Okafor medical story. 
 It almost wasn't. 
 I really thought Bianca was gonna die on that road. 
 She said everything she needed to say to her sister. 
 She was at peace. 
 Also, it's an... 
 Okafor-Austin medical story. 
 Second billing. 
 I'll take it. 
 This time. 
 What would you say? 
 You know, if you knew it was your last hour? 
 I don't know what I would say. 
 But I do know the person I would say it to... is you. 
 Our relationship is one of the most important ones in my life. 
 It is perfect. 
 Just like this. 
 Well, like I said in there, the heart can adapt. 
 So you have a good night, Mina Okafor. 
 Hold on, where are you taking her? 
 For a quick scan. 
 No visitors allowed. 
 We're not really going for scans, are we? 
 Nope. 
 Is your car ready? 
 I can take you to pick it up. 
 Oh! No, I think I'm gonna walk out to the impound lot. 
 It's not too far away. 
 I need the exercise. 
 A little time alone with my thoughts. 
 That was one hell of a day, hmm? 
 You're a hero, you know? 
 If you hadn't jumped in to stop Archer from shooting himself, he'd be dead. 
 No, man, I was supposed to keep an eye on him. 
 He should never have gotten to the gun in the first place. 
 That's on me. I think you should give yourself a break. 
 Hey, why don't you come over to our place later? 
 I'm tired. 
 Thanks, though. Come on, we'll order some pizza with Nic. It'll be fun. 
 I'm fine. You sure? 
 I think you could use it. 
 My ass just got fired, so... 
 I know I could use it. 
 Uh, not tonight. 
 Thank you. 
 This is the best scan I've ever tasted. 
 I guess I just had a case of... trapped-with-a-guard-itis. 
 They didn't teach me that in med school. 
 Mm. 
 You know, I wanted to be a doctor. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I really liked the idea of helping people. 
 But my parents put the kibosh on that. 
 Not a life for a princess. 
 My life is very controlled. 
 Look. This is the front of my apartment. 
 What do you see? 
 That's a camera. 
 Over there, an alarm. 
 And this one, another camera. 
 The whole place is like that... alarms and cameras everywhere. 
 They look like they're there to keep enemies out, but, really, they're keeping princesses caged in. 
 Well... you're free-range now. 
 For a short time. 
 Thank you. 
 I'd like to see you again. 
 Yeah. 
 Please. 
 You're not gonna make the first move, are you? 
 I'm at work. I... 
 Don't worry. 
 I got you. 
 They told me you were waking up. 
 Welcome back. 
 I have missed you. 
 Michelle. Shh. 
 She's perfect. 
 Beautiful. 
 Strong. Growing every day. 
 She has... chubby little legs. 
 Ten fingers and toes. 
 Excellent lungs. 
 Especially in the middle of the night. 
 Look. 
 Of course. 
 I'm not home, so now she sleeps. 
 You took good care of her. 
 Damn right I did. 
 For your information, I am her godmother. 
 I... I am great with babies. 
 At least this baby. 
 There was a learning curve, but I mastered it. 
 Ah. Here she is in the outfit your cousin sent. 
 Why is she making that face? 
 That's her pooping. 
 _ 
 Sorry I'm late. I was just pulling everything together. 
 No worries. Manufacturing specs, my first quarter projections, new marketing ideas. 
 Sorry, um, I'll wait for your investor. 
 Um, he actually just called. 
 His kid's sick. He can't make it. 
 But maybe that's for the better. I mean, after all, if we're gonna be working so closely, we should get to know each other. 
 Um, business partners should understand each other's mind-sets, yes, which is why I wish you would've given me a heads-up about the change in plans. 
 We'll make do. 
 A bottle of Sancerre is on its way. 
 It's dense, delicate, flavorful. 
 Or if you prefer a cocktail, I can... 
 _ 
 Uh, I'm so sorry. 
 A friend in crisis. It's a sick cat. 
 You understand. I have to deal with this. 
 We'll reschedule. 
 Your timing is impeccable. That's funny, I get told that a lot. 
 Wow. What's the occasion? 
 We both had a hard day. 
 I figured we could use a distraction. 
 ♪ I want to live ♪ You're the best distraction I've ever seen. 
 You're not so bad yourself. Mm. 
 ♪ Ooh, baby ♪ Just so we're clear, you're my one-hour person. 
 If I had one hour left to live, I would want to spend it with you. 
 I will take it. 
 ♪ Oh, baby, baby ♪ 
 ♪ Thanks to you ♪ 
 ♪ Only you... ♪ But don't die. 
 Here you go. 
 Yup, have a good one.
