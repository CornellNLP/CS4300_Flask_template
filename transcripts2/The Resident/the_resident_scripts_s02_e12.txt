 - Previously on The Resident... 
 - You're free to go. 
 - What? 
 - You made bail. 
 Let's get you your clothes and get you out of here. 
 - Well, have I convinced you? 
 - No, I did my homework. 
 Your new VNS device is top-rated. 
 Cheers. 
 You're telling me  that Bell thinks these hands killed Bradley Jenkins. 
 - You want my advice? 
 - Always. 
 Learn humility. 
 You make a mistake, own it. 
 It'll make you a better doctor. 
 I'm benching myself from surgery until further notice. 
 How are things at the clinic with Alec? 
 He seems to really care about what we're doing. 
 Can I open my eyes yet? 
 Watch your step. 
 Conrad, where are we? 
 What's that smell? 
 Is that banana bread? 
 Okay. 
 Open them. 
 It's coffee cake, the candle. 
 Jane called me yesterday. 
 Owner's a friend. 
 No open house yet, but Dr. Hawkins caught my son's IBD  last summer, so I owe him. 
 What do you think? 
 It's beautiful. 
 No more overnight bags. 
 Our own place. 
 Wait, is this for us? 
 Yes, of course it's for us. 
 I mean, look at this yard. 
 We get a hot tub,  - raise chickens. 
 - Chickens? 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 Why not? 
 And it's walking distance from Chastain  and two blocks from Trini Taqueria. 
 And I love all that. 
 Um... 
 But I mean, how are we gonna afford this? 
 The rent's basically  what we pay for two places now, so... 
 Look, take your time. 
 Look around. 
 Just let me know by tonight. 
 Hey, what's your name? 
 - Jenessa. 
 - Okay, what brought you in... 
 cough, cold, chest pain? 
 Do I get in faster if I say all of them? 
 Nausea and vomiting. 
 Got it. 
 - Nurse Myrick is on her way. 
 - Good. 
 - We need backup. 
 - As a patient. 
 It's like half Atlanta has the flu,  and the other half thinks they do. 
 Smiles, what are you here for? 
 I woke up this morning with the chills,  but I've never been happier in my life. 
 He's in love. 
 Don't get him started. 
 Her name is Sue. 
 Oh, she has this adorable cockapoo. 
 But yeah, so we went out for the first time last night,  and I've never felt this way before. 
 It's... 
 I mean, this girl... 
 Gentlemen, how much more do I got to hear about this chick? 
 I came in with an eye problem, now I wish it was my ears. 
 Whoa... 
 I am so sorry. 
 It's fine. 
 Kid's got a good arm. 
 Hello, key lime pie. 
 From admin, to boost morale. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 We need it. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
 No, get your own. 
 Get your own! 
 No communal food during flu season. 
 You're a monster, Pravesh. 
 - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 Listen up, people. 
 For some of you, Christmas has come again. 
 My 30-year-old hernia  - goes to my man Dr. Tolman. 
 - Thank you, Raptor. 
 I dig your tension-free mesh repair method. 
 Dr. Richter,  my cholecystectomy this morning is yours. 
 Go with God. 
 These are your patients. 
 Were. 
 Until Bradley's death  opened my eyes to my crippling ego. 
 I have a penance to serve. 
 So I am guest lecturing today at Billings University. 
 I figure I'd leave the cutting to more humble hands. 
 Dr. Nolan. 
 My splenectomy... 
 - are you up to the task? 
 - You know it, man. 
 - Mina will assist. 
 - Oh... 
 up top. 
 You know he's just having me babysit you, right? 
 - Thank you, Jessica. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 Could somebody please give me the surgical schedule  for... for the CEO? 
 Thank you. 
 Have fun. 
 Never been a fan of pineapple. 
 You? 
 I want to know who Gordon Page did business with  - before Chastain. 
 - Uh-huh. 
 Find out everything you can about  "the man who may save medicine."  But Chastain's already in business with him, aren't we? 
 Currently, yes. 
 So... mind if I ask why I'm doing research? 
 Just... think of this as an opportunity  for you to keep this job. 
 Got it. 
 Oh, also, my mom called again. 
 She needs to talk with you. 
 Um, I'll... 
 - Yeah, I'll call her. 
 Later. 
 - Thought you'd like to see this. 
 Oh. 
 No, no, no. 
 Yeah. 
 Don't worry, Dr. B. 
 I got you. 
 Thank you, Grayson. 
 You can go. 
 Oh, actually,  I heard it's bad this year. 
 Do you want me to swipe you an extra flu shot? 
 That's... 
 No. 
 That's not the way shots work, so no. 
 Oh. 
 What am I looking at? 
 Two more elective surgeries have cancelled. 
 - This-this flu season is killing us. 
 - How bad is it down there? 
 - What you about, man, huh? 
 - What's up, little man? 
 - What's up, little... 
 - What's up, man? 
 What's your problem? 
 - Man, are you kidding? 
 - I've been here for six hours, man. 
 - Oh, hell no. 
 - Come on,  - you want to come at me? 
 - What you got?! 
 - Come on, bro. 
 Let's go! 
 - Hold it. 
 Hey! 
 Get over here. 
 Ear muffs, on. 
 Asses in seats,  hands in pockets. 
 Should we do something? 
 - Look, we're all sick. 
 - I think she's got it covered. 
 And tired. 
 But we're just... 
 we're... 
 We got... 
 Oh, man... 
 Oh... 
 Doc, do you want to help her? 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Deep breaths. 
 Deep breaths. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Hey, take it easy. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Let's see. 
 How long have you been running a fever? 
 No clue. 
 I run hot. 
 So I... 
 Heard a badass broke up a fight in the ER. 
 Nic. 
 I was wondering if I was gonna get to see you. 
 - Of course I'd come see you. 
 - You didn't think I'd page her? 
 - Come on. 
 - Good boy. 
 I heard a rumor you were her favorite guard  during her stint in prison. 
 Yeah, and she was one of my favorite inmates, too. 
 Mm. 
 Sorry to say, I have no plans on going back there. 
 How's your girlfriend? 
 Oh, in Tampa. 
 We broke up. 
 - Oh. 
 - No, we'll stay friends. 
 No, scratch that. 
 No, we won't. 
 So how are you lovebirds? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 So, you have any idea what's wrong with me? 
 Well, your blood work shows very low platelets. 
 - That doesn't sound good. 
 - Mm, you'll need a transfusion,  but it's nothing to panic about. 
 Yeah, she's right. 
 Let us run a few tests. 
 We'll figure this out. 
 Where will I find Dr. Shaw? 
 Dr. Bell. 
 What a surprise. 
 Please tell me you didn't come all the way down here  - to cut our funding. 
 - Oh, no. 
 I can do that via e-mail. 
 Then to what do I owe this honor? 
 Well, I understand you have an expertise in infectious disease  and flu season has our ER short-staffed. 
 You don't want paranoid patients scaring off profitable ones. 
 But I don't have privileges at Chastain. 
 Check again. 
 I had you instated. 
 Well, then I'd be happy to help thin the crowd. 
 Glad to hear it. 
 In exchange for a few ultrasound machines. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 They're all spoken for. 
 Ah, too bad. 
 So am I. 
 One ultrasound. 
 - Three. 
 - Two. 
 Done. 
 An open splenectomy is faster. 
 Ten blade. 
 For the surgery, yes, but not the recovery. 
 And a minimally invasive approach has less complications. 
 Chastain has more than adequate facilities  to help Mr. 
 Fleming with his recovery. 
 And the hospital bills the insurance ten times more... 
 No wonder Bell likes you. 
 Allow me to make this a teachable moment. 
 Please don't. 
 We're a perfect match. 
 Is it weird if, when we're married, I take her name? 
 It was one date, Sam. 
 Now get this, we're both closer to our moms,  love Thai fusion and trap music. 
 So does most of Atlanta. 
 She just went hiking in Yosemite. 
 I did the same hike last year. 
 Match made in heaven. 
 - So how's your breathing? 
 - Fine. 
 Well, my heart's racing a little bit,  - but that's probably... 
 - Aw, don't say  it's 'cause of Sue. 
 Oh, come on man, you never felt that connection with someone? 
 Oh, you totally have. 
 Who is she? 
 What happened? 
 Don't tell me she got away. 
 Oh. 
 I can't let that happen with Sue. 
 She leaves for Spain tonight. 
 I got to see her  - before she goes. 
 Am I good? 
 - You're dehydrated. 
 I'm gonna keep you for IV fluids. 
 Sit tight. 
 I'm about to make an announcement, so just  sit tight, okay, you guys? 
 Please, please, please  - keep thinking. 
 - Hey, what's going on? 
 - Uh, right side. 
 - Ask him. 
 You guys are together... 
 that's perfect. 
 Um... 
 okay, listen up. 
 Okay, people, it's 1918, okay? 
 No microwaves,  Babe Ruth is pitching,  and life expectancy drops 12 years. 
 Anyone know why? 
 Was it World War I? 
 Wrong. 
 War only killed nine million,  but the Spanish flu killed over 50 million people. 
 Do I have your attention yet? 
 All right? 
 I've divided you into thirds. 
 Left side got their flu shots, right side didn't. 
 Middle group, you guys can't seem to remember. 
 Middle group, do better. 
 Right side, stay. 
 Left side, good news: you're going home with a care bag. 
 Chances are you'll catch something worse waiting here. 
 All right? 
 Move for me, let's do it. 
 All right. 
 Gonna get you all better,  - promise. 
 - Thank you. 
 It's like Moses parting the Red Sea. 
 When the next wave comes, get creative. 
 I don't really want to raise chickens. 
 Definitely seemed like  you wanted to raise some chickens. 
 Look, I don't have my heart set on that place anyway. 
 We could check out some others. 
 Uh... 
 I think I just... 
 need a minute. 
 I get it. 
 It's... 
 a big decision. 
 You called for an extra set of eyes? 
 Hey, yes. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 We were hoping that an infectious disease doctor  could tell us not to worry as much  as we are. 
 Our patient Meg has petechiae, her fever's rising. 
 Hasn't responded to treatment. 
 Leukocyte inclusions in the cytoplasm of neutrophils. 
 Right. 
 And Dohle bodies and toxic granulations. 
 And she's around a high-risk population in the jail. 
 I mean, are we crazy,  or could this be a new, rampant flu? 
 I'm hoping you're crazy, but you might be right,  which means we have to assume the worst. 
 It's possible Meg has a type of flu  that we don't even have a name for yet. 
 She could be highly contagious. 
 Look out! 
 We need to take precautions until we know  what we're dealing with. 
 Stop whatever it is from spreading. 
 What we need to do  is stop one patient from becoming 1,000. 
 Get your head up, get back, Meg. 
 Deep breath for me. 
 Deep breath. 
 It's okay, we're gonna take care of you. 
 Deep breath. 
 Breathe in for me. 
 Can I panic now? 
 You call the CEO  before you initiate quarantine at his hospital. 
 I know how you like to operate, Dr. 
 Hawkins, but it's a rule. 
 There's a good chance we contained this. 
 You contained one patient. 
 I have to stay  ahead of the curve to contain fear among hundreds of patients  and an entire staff. 
 You guys realize you're saying the same thing, right? 
 We all want to solve this as soon as possible. 
 What are the facts right now? 
 At this point, we only have theories,  the leading one being a possible epidemic strain of flu. 
 I've got something. 
 It may not be infectious. 
 Meg's taking levothyroxine for low thyroid function. 
 So we could have held off on the tent  - and all the speculation it generates. 
 - No, because  there's a better chance this is infectious. 
 Meg also said that some of the inmates at the prison were sick. 
 They could've had visitors who traveled internationally. 
 - I mean, she doesn't know. 
 - Jails are a nest for disease. 
 This could be where her symptoms started. 
 Levothyroxine or jail. 
 An etiological fork in the road. 
 I'm not gonna gamble,  so go down both avenues. 
 Okay, I'll get her started on broad-spectrum antibiotics  and send a thyroid panel  off to the lab, but my gut instinct... 
 - It came from the jail. 
 - Right. 
 So I'll head there, try to find  whoever or whatever made Meg sick. 
 I'll go with Alec. 
 Are you sure you want to go back there? 
 I know the lay of the land. 
 Well, handle this discreetly. 
 Rumors of an outbreak are just gonna fuel the chaos. 
 We have to thin the ER again before a riot breaks out. 
 Dr. 
 Shaw said to get creative. 
 Ooh. 
 M... 
 Mm, I got nothing. 
 Okay, listen up. 
 If your temperature checked in over 100 go to the left. 
 If you're over 65 or have a chronic medical condition,  make your way to the right. 
 Uh, who are these people and why are they in VIP? 
 Flu patients. 
 ER's overflowing, but you've got space. 
 Orders came from you-know-who from you-know-where. 
 We'll be out in 90 minutes flat. 
 Thinking outside the box might lead to Bell  putting our medical careers in a pine box. 
 Never thought I'd be back here so soon. 
 As a nurse? 
 Inmate. 
 Cell block 6. 
 Relax. 
 I was framed for breaking and entering. 
 Liquor store? 
 Oncology clinic. 
 Well, either way,  - I'm impressed. 
 - Mm. 
 I'm sure you've fought  some incredible battles practicing medicine  - all over the world. 
 - Uh, here and there. 
 But I never stayed in one place long enough  to stir up Nic Nevin's kind of trouble. 
 What about now? 
 Is the clinic just a pit stop  or you planning on sticking around for a while? 
 We'll see where tomorrow takes me. 
 Today I'm just trying to find patient zero. 
 This could take a while. 
 Conrad got Meg's test results. 
 It's not a thyroid storm. 
 As predicted. 
 Now we try to find an atypical infection in the crowd. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hello, ladies, up here. 
 Hi. 
 Uh, this is Nurse Nevin. 
 I'm Dr. 
 Shaw. 
 Uh, it's a life-or-death situation today,  so I really need your cooperation. 
 If you check the following three boxes, please raise your hand. 
 We want triple threats only. 
 Rash... anywhere from the ankles up. 
 Swelling in the pits, neck, or groin. 
 Sky-high fever. 
 Me, over here. 
 Betsy, faking it  to the infirmary... 
 not gonna happen today,  unless you're actually sick. 
 - She was my cellmate. 
 - Wow. 
 The unhealthy trinity. 
 They've gotten something from Meg,  given it to Meg, or none of the above. 
 Well, we've isolated one. 
 Now we interrogate three. 
 The rash started around the time I got cleanup duty. 
 When was that? 
 - Few months ago. 
 - Is it just on your arms? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Latex allergy. 
 Mild fever. 
 Have you had this your whole life? 
 - Maybe. 
 - It's a birthmark. 
 Okay. 
 - Flu shot? 
 - Don't offer 'em. 
 - Any direct contact with Meg? 
 - Just about every day. 
 These marks on your hand... 
 can I see them? 
 Yeah, but it ain't a rash. 
 Are those bites? 
 I feed a family of pigeons on the yard. 
 One of them's got a bad attitude. 
 Did Meg feed them, too? 
 So I feed a few pigeons  and now I'm gonna die of what... bird flu? 
 You may not have the flu at all. 
 We think it might be  cryptococcosis. 
 It's a fungal infection  you can get from pigeon droppings. 
 Listen, Handsome Head,  I been shivved twice,  several concussions,  mononucleosis, shingles. 
 I-If it's bad, tell me. 
 I want to know exactly what's making you sick  before I answer that. 
 Do you want to call someone... friends, family? 
 Just... 
 tell them where you are? 
 I'd like to call my ex-girlfriend,  but I really blew that one. 
 Looks like I'm not so good  at this relationship thing. 
 Not so sure I am either. 
 You better tighten it up. 
 Nic's a catch. 
 She's a gem. 
 Don't let that one go. 
 Doing my best. 
 You hang tight. 
 Be back to do the scope on your lungs. 
 I got the answers you want. 
 - You ready for this? 
 - Just spit it out. 
 The last hospital QuoVadis was involved with  was Jacksonville General. 
 Gordon worked with them extensively... 
 Define "extensively". 
 It was the hospital where he ran trials  for another device of some kind. 
 Which device? 
 Who was the CEO? 
 - Uh, okay, you lost me. 
 - Oh, for crying out loud. 
 I'll do it myself. 
 The charge nurse needs me to speak to a patient,  so you get one more chance to get this right. 
 I need to talk to the CEO Gordon did business with. 
 It's not just about the where, it's also about the whom. 
 - Totally makes sense. 
 - Do... 
 - Really? 
 - Yeah, I get it. 
 - I will-I will do that. 
 - Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Good talk. 
 Hey. 
 You paged? 
 I did. 
 I saw something that made me nervous. 
 I want to see if it makes you nervous. 
 In here. 
 Hey, Sam. 
 Mm, Dr. Pravesh, you're back. 
 - Good to see you, man. 
 - How we feeling, Sam? 
 Well, pretty lousy, actually. 
 When'd you get that rash? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 Definitely nervous. 
 We need help with a patient move. 
 Hundley, we need to limit exposure to other patients  - and all hospital staff. 
 - Masks. 
 I'm on it. 
 Angelique. 
 Masks, people. 
 Keep it moving, folks. 
 - Here you go, sweetheart. 
 Put that on. 
 - Why do we need masks? 
 - Does he have Ebola? 
 - It's just procedure. 
 Hundley, get a mask on. 
 Mask, please. 
 Sam, I'm gonna put this mask on you, okay? 
 Ready? 
 - Yep. 
 - Let's go. 
 What's going on? 
 Where... 
 where are you moving me? 
 Isolation. 
 So I thought you said you had this under control. 
 Now there are two more patients with worsening symptoms. 
 Spiking fevers, hemorrhaging. 
 And people are afraid  - they're caught in an outbreak. 
 - Nobody thinks that. 
 Trending hashtag... 
 "the outbreak hospital"... 
 - says otherwise. 
 - This is not an outbreak. 
 I did a bronchoscopy to check for cryptococcus. 
 We have confirmed it is not fungal. 
 So you know what it's not, but you still have  no idea what it is. 
 Marburg, Lassa. 
 All viral hemorrhagic fevers are still on the table. 
 That's why we have PAPR suits just in case. 
 And we've already contacted the CDC. 
 Whatever it is, we are prepared to handle it. 
 Emory will handle it. 
 The only thing you need to prepare  - is your transfer summary. 
 - Hold on. 
 You are not transferring these patients. 
 I am. 
 Because a two-patient problem risks being  a Chastain nightmare. 
 If these infections keep getting worse,  a helicopter ride could be a death sentence. 
 Emory is a top-tier infectious disease hospital. 
 The federal government literally  pays them to take charge of this scenario. 
 Emory is tasked with taking care of patients  other hospitals are incapable of managing. 
 But we are all over this thing. 
 I beg to differ. 
 Gonna take me a couple hours to arrange the chopper  and the transfers. 
 
 
 
 That's how long you have. 
 If you can diagnose and treat before it lands,  then... 
 great. 
 Job well done. 
 If you see blood, it's your own. 
 The room is cold, the scalpel is sharp. 
 I can assure you and your weak stomach  he will not bleed. 
 I'm sorry. 
 He, uh, s-still looks... 
 Looks alive. 
 He's not. 
 The first time you step into the OR  your patient will look dead,  but he won't be. 
 It's a tricky thing to wrap your head around. 
 In the OR  you must only follow your instinct. 
 Everything else, you check at the door. 
 Watch. 
 This damn valve is too big. 
 No, I think you're holding it upside down. 
 Which is, I believe, what Julian  was trying to tell you. 
 Uh, what's in the box? 
 Seven QuoVadis heart valves. 
 And why are they here? 
 I want you to put them through the pulse duplicator. 
 And why are you here? 
 I'm helping someone get back to where they belong  and you have reached the ceiling on your consecutive questions,  so run the tests. 
 Okay, pump it harder. 
 And this time,  mimic the flow of blood of an agile patient. 
 A-A little more. 
 We are gonna be in so much trouble. 
 The valves aren't strong enough for a younger, active patient. 
 Like Bradley. 
 He can't breathe. 
 What should I do? 
 I'll be right in. 
 What's going on? 
 Sam's oxygen sats are dropping. 
 I'm on it. 
 Meg, don't get out of bed. 
 Hey, good to go. 
 He's not protecting his airway. 
 I need to intubate. 
 She's seizing! 
 Meg, hold on. 
 I can't get an airway. 
 She's gonna aspirate. 
 Nic, what are you doing? 
 It's not safe without the suit. 
 There's no time for a suit. 
 She was gonna aspirate into her lungs and die. 
 You would have done the same thing. 
 - I told you I had it. 
 - I heard what you said. 
 I made the call. 
 Let's just get back to work. 
 Nic... 
 you've been exposed. 
 I know. 
 I'll stay in isolation. 
 Masks on. 
 Doors closed. 
 Nothing to see but definitely something to catch  if you don't cover your faces and clear the way. 
 Milosh! 
 Golden Girls is on now. 
 - Golden Girls? 
 - Yeah. 
 Get back in your room. 
 Nice assist. 
 Nice block. 
 No brain bleed. 
 So her seizure was caused by the infection. 
 Lymph nodes are filled with fluid. 
 Immunoglobulins just came back. 
 Abnormally low. 
 Compromised immune system explains  the rapid progression of the symptoms. 
 Not much time before we lose her. 
 I'll identify the infection once I get a fluid sample  from a needle aspiration. 
 Two needle aspirations: Meg  and Sam. 
 Feel fine. 
 Keeping the suit on just in case I'm not infected. 
 Was my concern that obvious? 
 Hopefully we have a diagnosis soon. 
 We can get you both out of here. 
 Well, apart from the potential  of having a life-threatening infection,  living in isolation hasn't been so bad. 
 Conrad, things got crazy around here today;  otherwise I would have found you to talk to. 
 Eh, don't worry. 
 House is off the table. 
 - I let it go. 
 - You did what? 
 Eh, it just didn't feel right. 
 But we can keep looking. 
 If you even want to. 
 Alec needs that sample ASAP,  so we better get that transfer ready. 
 Where are my disciples? 
 Sharing a six-foot sub, paid for by me. 
 You bought them a man sandwich? 
 Yes. 
 All to get you alone so I could admit to your face  that you are a god. 
 I'm listening eagerly, but I'm very hungry. 
 Did you order me anything? 
 Oh, God. 
 You are arrogant and your ego could fill this room,  but you're gonna shut your ass up and listen, August. 
 I ran seven QuoVadis valves through a pulse simulator. 
 I think I can prove that Bradley's death was caused  by a device error, not an operator error. 
 Desperation is not a good look on you, Mina. 
 Manipulation is even worse. 
 Are you calling me a liar? 
 I'm saying, when I was a young, spongey pup,  I would have done anything to get my mentor, Abe Benedict back  - if he were circling down the drain. 
 - Oh, that's not what I'm doing. 
 The same Abe Benedict who vouched for QuoVadis valves. 
 Who showed me that my ego was what most likely  caused Bradley his death. 
 So no, Mina, it's not that I don't trust you. 
 I just trust him a hell of a lot more. 
 Well, he's wrong, and you're stubborn. 
 If the point of this whole penance  is to get yourself to listen,  then I suggest you start listening. 
 Bradley was not your fault. 
 Yersinia pestis. 
 Black Death itself. 
 It's not just any plague. 
 Multi-drug resistant. 
 It's the most unusual presentation I've ever heard of. 
 And this strain is resistant to every antibiotic but colistin. 
 We need to get the patients the right treatment immediately. 
 We need to get Nic on prophylaxis. 
 Stat. 
 And Sam's bacterial load is much higher than Meg's. 
 He's had this for longer. 
 So Sam infected Meg. 
 We need to find out where Sam's been. 
 Whoever got him infected is out there  spreading it all over Atlanta. 
 Sam's intubated, but I know who can help us. 
 Black Plague. 
 That's quite a zebra. 
 Ever seen it? 
 Ten cases a year in the United States,  mostly on the West Coast. 
 Sam brought it here, but someone gave it to him. 
 What did he tell you in the ER? 
 You mean what didn't he tell me. 
 Okay, replay it all. 
 We need to know where he went, who he saw. 
 Okay. 
 He picked flowers in Piedmont Park. 
 Um, he basically spent the entire day primping  for a first date with his future wife, Sue. 
 Wait. 
 She hikes. 
 - She just hiked. 
 - Hiked where? 
 Yosemite. 
 Yosemite is a hotbed for plague carried by fleas. 
 She could be our patient zero. 
 What did dispatch say? 
 Busted down Sue's front door. 
 Found her minimally responsive,  thready pulse. 
 Get her isolated. 
 Let's go. 
 Okay, ready? 
 One, two, three. 
 - Buboes. 
 - We need more access. 
 Septic shock. 
 All right, I'll put in the central line. 
 Give me the kit. 
 Fluids and antibiotics. 
 Remember, this is a multi-drug resistant strain. 
 Already talked to the pharmacy. 
 Colistin being mixed as we speak. 
 Let's just hope we're not too late. 
 Is Sue okay? 
 Tell me she's okay. 
 It was close, but she's gonna make it. 
 - You all are. 
 - Yes. 
 Dr. Pravesh, awesome work from you and... 
 the doctors and everyone. 
 Wow. 
 Sue gave me the plague. 
 And I know, I know it's nuts, but... 
 I find it kind of romantic. 
 Imagine what happens to this kid  had Sue bought the farm? 
 Make fun all you want, Meg. 
 I'm fine with it. 
 You know why? 
 And maybe it's corny. 
 It was love at first sight with me and Sue. 
 Please tell me you didn't steal those two ultrasounds. 
 Didn't have to. 
 A little bartering with Master Bell. 
 I scratched him, he scratched me. 
 Everyone wins. 
 - Mostly the patients. 
 - Well, yeah. 
 They are all that matters, so whatever it takes. 
 Hey, Nic, is everything okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, no, I'm good. 
 I just... 
 I wanted to come and say thank you for your help today. 
 I learned a few things. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 Now you deserve some rest. 
 Why don't you go home and have a couple cold ones with Conrad? 
 Enjoy yourself. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I need to do that. 
 Have a good night, Alec. 
 What are we doing here? 
 Ah, well, there's our table. 
 People are at that table. 
 Dr. Benedict. 
 My man and mentor. 
 This is Dr. 
 Mina Okafor, the yin to my yang. 
 Oh, nice to meet you. 
 You both just happen to be here? 
 Or we knew you'd happen to be here. 
 It's Tuesday night foie gras, baby, all right? 
 Oh, what can I do for you, then, Dr. 
 Austin? 
 Well, actually, Doc, you've done enough. 
 You've been a great mentor these last six years. 
 Oh, you sound like somebody who's gonna quit. 
 Does it?: Oh, no. 
 On the contrary. 
 Yeah, I'm here because I wanted you to explain to me  and my partner exactly why you vouch for QuoVadis. 
 I told you, the penicillin on the... 
 Dollars for Docs. 
 - Ever heard of that? 
 - Probably not. 
 It's a ProPublica site on the interwebs  that releases details on corporate payouts. 
 So, we're here specifically  to find out more about that 1.5-mil ticket  that Mr. Gordon Page deposited into your bank account. 
 Honey, will you give us a minute? 
 I'd prefer to have this conversation in my office... 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 See, when Dr. Okafor believes in something... 
 or in this case, someone... 
 she will swim through a lake of fire and brimstone  to reach her objective. 
 Whereas you... 
 you led me to believe  that my arrogance killed my patient. 
 When in fact, it was a company that makes defective valves  and owns you. 
 Disappointing. 
 Anything you'd like to add? 
 Not at the moment. 
 See you around, Abe. 
 You want the good, the bad or the ugly? 
 In that order. 
 Good: I found the CEO and head of neurosurgery  at Jacksonville General, Dr. 
 Ryan Kehoe. 
 Also went to Cabo with Gordon Page. 
 Uh, pioneered his new back device,  opinion leader for QuoVadis. 
 Sounding familiar? 
 Bad: that scotch is from my mom. 
 She and my dad crossed paths at my Aunt Denise's wedding,  and the DJ's choice of mid-'70s soft rock reignited their spark  in a sloppy way that makes me cringe. 
 - But they had... 
 - What's the ugly? 
 You can't meet with Dr. 
 Kehoe because he's dead. 
 Ten months ago, at the height of his partnership with QuoVadis,  he jumped off the Dames Point Bridge. 
 - Look, you didn't... 
 - Are you...? 
 Look, Conrad, I like what we have. 
 Where we are. 
 I don't want things to change. 
 Not right now, anyway. 
 I just... 
 I spend so much of my time  trying to figure it out what to tell patients,  trying to alleviate their fears before and after the diagnosis,  to protect them, but sometimes  a hard truth is just the best thing for everyone. 
 So... 
 how about you and I stop dancing around the issue  and we just get real honest with each other? 
 What do you want me to say? 
 Well, that we find ourselves in different places? 
 Once again. 
 Yes, but that doesn't mean that I don't want  to move in with you or get married, all of it,  just not this second. 
 - Isn't that okay? 
 - And I respect that. 
 If it's the truth. 
 Okay, Conrad, you seem to have all the answers to what's wrong,  and probably a way to fix it. 
 Go ahead. 
 It's already fixed. 
 Look at me. 
 Willing to sit down, talk things through. 
 That's progress, right? 
 And that's thanks to you. 
 But that's the problem right there. 
 There's nothing left for you to fix. 
 - That's not fair. 
 - Well... 
 it's not about being fair. 
 Nic, it's about being honest. 
 I was a project for you, and now it's finished. 
 That's my fear. 
 That's my diagnosis. 
 Is it true? 
 All right, I shouldn't have come here today. 
 Well, tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm right. 
 Either way, just open up like you asked me to do. 
 And I will, when I'm ready, when I figure some things out. 
 Would it help if I went back to the old version of me? 
 I'm not sure I like either version of you right now. 
 At least now you're being honest. 
 Good night, Conrad.
