 Previously on The Resident... I'm gonna retire. 
 I'd like to float your name to the network for a possible trial run. 
 This is Bill Laundry, owner of Georgia FC. 
 Well, you guys seem to know what you're doing. 
 Guess it's good that Dax landed here. 
 We only employ the best at Chastain. 
 Dawn is a single mom of seven kids that she adopted through the Foster Care program. 
 Will you let me fight this cancer with you? 
 There is only a slim hope this will buy you more time. 
 I will do anything against any odds to stay with my kids as long as I can. 
 Good news. Your mother is ready to leave the ICU and go to a great rehab facility. 
 Don't give up before the miracle. 
 Wondering about the timing. Meaning? 
 If you keep her alive, you can claim your patient survived the mother of all surgeries. 
 Does it ever get to you? 
 These patients, kept alive by machines. 
 They don't talk. We have no idea what they want, or even if they're still capable of wanting anything at all. 
 First time moonlighting at a vent farm? 
 Med school debt is no joke, but I'm chipping away at it. 
 Well, we try not to get too philosophical around here. 
 It's a job. Leave it at that. 
 Her BP's low. She's febrile. 
 Nothing new for this one. 
 Likely another pneumonia. 
 We'll have to put her on a travel vent. 
 You're gonna transfer her? Attending's orders. 
 If she stays hypotensive and spikes a temp over 102, we send her back to Chastain for treatment. 
 Is that reasonable? 
 She has no meaningful brain function. 
 This is Dawn Long. 
 The one from TV. 
 The Mother of All Surgeries patient. 
 The one and only. 
 When was she last conscious? Right before she went into surgery. 
 She's practically a corpse. 
 We should be planning end-of-life care, not an ICU transfer. Like I said, we try not to overthink. 
 But if you really want to make a thing out of this, take it up with Dr. Cain. 
 I don't want Derek to minimize his symptoms. 
 Doctors could use that to dismiss him. 
 He will be seen by the best of the best. 
 You have to calm down. They'll send a resident. 
 They're just barely real doctors. This is a teaching hospital, the residents are very qualified. 
 Good morning. I'm Dr. Conrad Hawkins. 
 Real doctor, by the way. 
 Conrad, thank God. This is my son-in-law, Derek. 
 I've been trying to get him to see a doctor for a month now. 
 He's been complaining of shortness of breath. Mom. 
 Let Derek speak for himself. 
 And my daughter, Molly. 
 Uh, it started a few weeks ago. 
 It's probably just a little cough. 
 Uh, he's had night sweats and fatigue. 
 What if he has eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis? Molly's in her second year of med school. 
 Oh, doctors raising doctors. I love it. 
 Now, how about I take a look at Derek and everyone else heads to the cafeteria. 
 And for this one, insider tip: order the hot chocolate, extra marshmallows. 
 Hot chocolate? 
 Fantastic idea. 
 Cocoa on me. Come on, you. 
 Smooth move, doc. 
 Deep breath. 
 They always like that together? 
 Uh, well, Molly can get a little nervous. 
 And you're the eye of the hurricane? 
 I try. 
 But I'm-I'm pulling double duty, what with Molly in med school and all. 
 Working and taking care of the kid. 
 I'm even coaching her softball team this year. 
 I get it, you're super dad. 
 That kind of stress can take its toll. 
 Molly stayed home when Josie was a baby, so I figure it's my turn now. 
 Okay. 
 Well, my job is to focus on you. 
 So, let's get a chest X-ray and find out what's going on, okay? 
 Okay, yeah. 
 I guess that's why I'm here. 
 You're in the right place. 
 Randolph, you've done really well with these guest spots. 
 I'm happy. Producers are happy. 
 So now it's time to knock it out of the park. 
 Got any last minute pointers? 
 Make the show your own. 
 Not an ounce of sugar goes into my body. 
 I-I've been tired all the time, uh, muscle ache. 
 Now my gums have started bleeding. 
 Would you mind if I have a look? Sure. 
 Well... 
 Albert, have you ever heard of Dr. James Lind? 
 No. Lind was an 18th-century surgeon's mate in the British Royal Navy. 
 And at sea, they had a diet a lot like yours. 
 And that was back in the day when more sailors were lost to a mysterious illness than to any enemy. 
 And ships' captains were prescribing vinegar and cider, and even sea water, until James Lind discovered that... 
 ... with just a little bit of Vitamin C... Ooh... 
 ... he could cure thousands of what I'm about to cure you of... 
 Scurvy. 
 So, save your money, throw away your home remedies, put a little citrus in your diet, or buy a peg leg. It's up to you. 
 Need a doctor? 
 Ring the Bell. 
 Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell! 
 Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell! 
 Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell! 
 Hey, I got your page, what's up? 
 Remember Dr. Cain's patient who was on The Montel Williams Show? 
 Yeah. I thought she was in rehab. 
 According to her chart, she is. 
 She's been at an LTACH this whole time? Yes. 
 And what's worse, she's been hauled back to Chastain for treatment five times. Strokes, pneumonias, infections. 
 She's not getting better, but Cain wants her diagnosed, treated, and sent back to the LTACH. 
 What I want is for Dawn Long to get better, so her children can have their mother back. 
 How's she doing? Not good. 
 Fever. Increased sputum. Hypoxia. 
 All signs point to lower respiratory tract infection. 
 She's such a good woman. 
 And her family... so wonderful. Dr. Cain, are her children aware that she's not gonna be waking up? 
 Absolutely not. Because we don't know that for sure yet. 
 The brain is an enigma. Anything can happen. 
 Of course, but... 
 I mean, it's been six months. 
 Doesn't look like it's heading in the right direction. 
 Has it really been six months? 
 You want your patient to wake up, you want it so badly, you just hold out hope. 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Maybe I haven't been completely honest with myself or with her family. 
 It's time we let this poor woman pass peacefully. 
 In the meantime, I need you two to do everything you can to keep her alive until I can get her family in here. 
 Those children deserve one last moment with their mother. 
 Can you do that for me, please? 
 Sure thing, Dr. Cain. 
 Thank you. 
 I did not expect that. 
 Let's hope we don't have to put her through any more than we already have. 
 Wow, honey, nice. 
 Okay, Derek, your X-rays are up. 
 We're gonna take a look at what's going on in your lungs. 
 Oh, I thought maybe we should put mesothelioma at the top of Derek's differential. 
 His office is old. 
 Might have asbestos. 
 Well, he's young for mesothelioma. 
 But old office, I'll keep that in mind. 
 Let Conrad be the doctor, darling. 
 Okay. 
 See this white area on your X-ray? 
 That means your right lung is filled with something. 
 Could be fluid. 
 If it is, we'll drain it, run a CT and see what's causing all the trouble. 
 And reevaluate from there. How bad is it? 
 The fluid, I mean. 
 Well... It's not a big deal at all. 
 Right, Dr. Hawkins? 
 Kit. 
 Whiteout of the right hemithorax is absolutely a big deal. 
 I know, but I had to stop you. 
 Molly does not handle stress well. 
 In fact, she utterly falls apart. Well, she's worried. 
 That's to be expected. Trust me. 
 Her freshman year of college she had so much anxiety she had to drop out and live at home. 
 Did you see her clawing at her wrists? 
 Mm-hmm. That's a tell. 
 She's about to go into a tailspin. 
 Still... there are a number of things that could be wrong with your son-in-law. 
 I can't... 
 I can't withhold information from a patient. 
 Of course. And I would never ask you to do that. 
 Derek is the patient and you can tell him anything, 'cause he can handle anything. 
 But if any bad news is coming, could you please filter it through me? 
 I will try to tell you any news first, so that you can be the Molly whisperer. 
 Thank you. 
 You're lucky I like you. 
 It's the accent. 
 Executives are coming in tomorrow. 
 We're gonna be selling "Ring the Bell" T-shirts by Friday. 
 Y-Yeah. About that catchphrase... 
 Hey, it's great, huh? 
 We paid that woman to start the chant. 
 Just get the audience riled up. Worked like a charm. 
 Yep. Yeah. Loved it. 
 So, listen, let's go by the production office and you can weigh in on tomorrow's guest. Oh, well, I can't. 
 I have a shift at Chastain. 
 Yeah, those are good where they are. 
 You do realize that if you take over this show, you're gonna have to cut back your surgical schedule drastically. Well, that may be an issue. 
 I'm already pushing it at Chastain. 
 I really can't take much more time off as it is. 
 I am a doctor, you know. Yes, you are a doctor. 
 A TV doctor. 
 Which is not a part-time job. 
 What's the point of having a famous doctor on staff if he's not available? Man, you got to make that shot! 
 I know you originally scheduled this with Dr. Bell, Mr. Landry, but right now he's very busy outside of the hospital. 
 You requested a top surgeon, right? 
 Right. Dr. Austin is our finest. 
 Dr. Hawkins is too kind, yet remarkably accurate. 
 I know you're good. 
 You saved my star rookie. That's him right there. 
 See that dribble? It's thanks to you he can still do that. 
 But I've been in and out of surgeries for a decade. Yep, you had that appendectomy back in '09, which led to a post-op infection. 
 Which led to recurrent bowel obstruction and small bowel resection. 
 Every time I lose intestine... my dinner plate shrinks. 
 I just want to break this cycle once and for all. 
 And we are gonna make that happen for you. 
 This operation is extremely delicate. 
 But I am precise and I have the patience of a western diamondback rattlesnake. 
 Rattlesnakes are patient. Come on, fellas. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, you cut me open. 
 Just do your best to make it the last time. 
 Best is my only mode, Mr. Landry. 
 See you soon. Thank you, guys. 
 Oh, that's a handball! 
 Huh. 
 I wonder where Molly gets her scratching habit from. 
 You see how wound up my daughter is now? 
 You should have seen her before Derek came along. 
 I'm not sure what we'd do without him. 
 Mm. Let's not go there. 
 Derek has a mass in his chest. 
 Ring the Bell. 
 Aw, you got a case of the scurvy, matey. 
 Let's-let's just not do that. 
 Ah, where's the Hollywood smile? 
 I loved the whole schtick. 
 It's not a schtick. 
 It's medicine, only on TV. 
 Right. 
 Now if you'll excuse me, I have a gallbladder removal. 
 Oh, uh, we-we weren't sure if you were coming back today, so they moved that up the schedule and I covered that for you. 
 We... You were off doing your thing. 
 Which is definitely not a schtick. 
 Yeah. 
 Full day. 
 I got to jet. 
 Hey. 
 I just got a readmissions alert in my e-mail. 
 Why is Dawn Long back in this hospital? 
 She's sick. Is that supposed to be a joke? 
 She's been back here five times since her operation. 
 Her treatment costs are beginning to add up. 
 You're supposed to be making us money, not costing us. 
 The woman is comatose. Why are we not letting her die? 
 We will. Tomorrow. 
 Care to elaborate? 
 After six months, Dawn Long's survival statistics will no longer be tracked, and our famous Mother of all Surgeries will have an official survivor. 
 It's one for the record books. 
 And that six month mark... Is tomorrow. 
 She lives through the night, then all of the publicity we got from that surgery will not go to waste. 
 We just need to keep her breathing until the morning. 
 And the family is on board for that? 
 They will be. 
 Okay. 
 One more day, then end this charade. 
 Question. 
 Why is she so sick? 
 She's bedridden, on a vent, decrease in swallowing function. 
 All adds up to pneumonia. Very common. 
 Are you sure? 
 It's pneumonia. Trust me. 
 A mass? 
 What kind of mass? We're not sure yet. 
 Is there a chance he'll have to stay overnight? 
 We've got softball tomorrow, Dad. 
 I know, honey. Don't worry. 
 We're just gonna do a biopsy. 
 It's a quick procedure in the OR. 
 But you must have some idea what the mass is. 
 There's no point in speculating. 
 Yeah, let's just wait for the biopsy results before jumping to any conclusions. 
 A nurse will prep you in a few minutes. 
 I'll be watching the entire time. 
 Mom. 
 What are you hiding? 
 Pardon? I saw how you stopped Dr. Hawkins from talking earlier. 
 You're not fooling me. I know how you get when you're worried. 
 My husband has a mass in his chest. 
 It's perfectly rational for me to look for answers. 
 Why don't you take Josie and grab a bite? 
 The biopsy won't take long. Josie's coloring. She's fine. 
 Mom, quit sidelining me. I'm not 18 anymore. 
 I can handle whatever it is you're worried about. 
 I'm not worried about anything. 
 Everything is gonna be okay. 
 Retractor. 
 Molly's nerves are sky high, and mine are catching up. 
 We need something to go smoothly today. 
 Thank you for being here, Conrad. 
 Well, you're family. Of course. 
 Thank you for taking this, AJ. 
 Anything for you, Dr. V. 
 Dissecting down to the mediastinum. 
 Scope to me. 
 Passing the scope anterior to the trachea. 
 Identifying my landmarks. 
 Uh... 
 All good down there? 
 I'm flush against the pulmonary artery. 
 How close is it? 
 Biopsy forceps. 
 Oh, please, don't nick that artery. 
 He won't. 
 And... 
 ... fin. He didn't. 
 Let's get this little nugget to the lab, shall we? 
 And now we wait for the pathology report. 
 I hate this part. 
 Mr. Kim. 
 Welcome back, Dr. Bell. 
 Can I help you? 
 I'm just gonna take a wild guess and assume you're behind my removal from the surgical schedule. 
 That's what you wanted, right? 
 Why would that be what I wanted? 
 From what I hear, you've been AWOL for weeks, working your second job. 
 My second job? I'm on a TV show bringing publicity to Chastain. 
 And if a surgery has to be handed off to an alternate once in a blue moon, it's a small price to keep a top surgeon around. Is that what you are? 
 We all pass our prime, but we don't all retire into fame and fortune. 
 Maybe don't look a gift horse in the mouth. 
 I see you're having trouble understanding. I'll simplify. 
 You lose me, you lose more than a surgeon. 
 I know you'd love any reason to get rid of me, but trust me, you want me cutting and you want me happy. 
 Don't be dramatic, Dr. Bell. 
 I don't want you gone. 
 I just don't care if you're here. 
 Feldman. 
 Got your page. Dr. Bell. 
 I didn't expect it to be you. I just asked for any available general surgeon. 
 Well, I'm between patients at the moment. 
 What's the problem? 
 Well, uh... follow me. 
 Uh... 
 Perirectal abscess. 
 You expect me to lance a boil on a patient's ass? 
 It's too close to the rectal muscle for me to do it. 
 Rules dictate a general surgeon drains it. 
 Sorry. 
 Good afternoon, Nurse. 
 Have Pravesh and Nevin learned anything about Ms. Long? 
 Uh, not yet. 
 Her prelim cultures are negative, but her BP has hardly improved. 
 Okay, let's open up the box. 
 Order fungal markers, MALDI-TOF, the whole gamut. 
 Uh, what are we testing for? 
 Everything. Uh, you know, I just want to be thorough. 
 Okay. I'll have Dr. Pravesh put in those orders. 
 Nurse... 
 ... this case is deeply personal to me. 
 I brought Dawn Long into Chastain. 
 I was her surgeon. 
 I held her children's hands through the post-op. 
 I am gonna be the last person to leave her funeral. 
 I put her care entirely on my shoulders, and I'm gonna continue to do so moving forward, because... 
 I am her doctor. 
 Nobody else. Am I making myself clear? 
 Absolutely. 
 You're gonna order that fungal culture under my name. 
 And who are you gonna send the results to? 
 You, Dr. Cain. Anybody else? 
 No. 
 Attagirl. 
 Dr. Bell. 
 To what do I owe this pleasure? 
 I heard you're operating on Bill Landry today. 
 I am. 5:00 p.m. sharp. 
 Don't you love punctuality? 
 Need an extra hand? I do not. 
 I'm free at 5:00 p.m. 
 Excellent. I've got some book recommendations. 
 I've done a lot of bowel resections. As have I. 
 AJ, come on, man. I'm going stir-crazy. 
 My whole schedule's been cleared for the day. 
 Right, so you could be on television. 
 Wow. You, too. Okay. I'll tell you what. 
 I will keep you in mind for surgery. All right? 
 And if I do need you, I will make sure to ring the... Don't. 
 Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Don't... 
 Derek has an aggressive B-cell lymphoma. 
 I'm so sorry, Kit. 
 From here on in, there are two parts to a patient's life. 
 Before you know you have cancer and after you know. 
 Right now, they're in Derek's room living in the before. 
 I heard them planning tomorrow's dinner. 
 Brainstorming vacations for after Molly's school is finished. 
 But you and I... we're already living in the after, where you don't plan vacations, where you know everything is not gonna be okay for a very long time, if ever. 
 And we must drag them into the after with us, and that is a terrible, terrible thing to do. 
 I could tell them for you. 
 No. No. 
 This is my family. 
 They're gonna remember these words forever, and they must come from me. 
 Cancer? 
 Mommy, what's the matter? 
 Daddy? It's all right, honey. 
 It's okay. Everything's okay. 
 Kit, can you please have someone take Josie to the play area? 
 Of course. 
 I don't want to go. I know, sweetie. 
 It's just, it's, uh, it's grown-up time right now. 
 It's fine. 
 Oh. 
 Thank you, honey. 
 What's next? 
 The oncologist, Dr. Jones, will be in to talk to you soon. 
 He's a specialist in this type of lymphoma. 
 What are the chances of me getting out of this alive? 
 It's survivable. 
 How survivable? 
 Dr. Hawkins. 
 I have a daughter... and I have a wife to think about. 
 I need to know if we should start making plans, so please, just lay it out for me. 
 There's still a lot we don't know. 
 The chemo is called R-CHOP, and it is not easy. 
 It'll make you feel tired, nauseous. 
 Your white blood cell counts will drop, it could cause an infection. 
 But when you make it through that... 
 Please. What are my chances? 
 You have a 50% chance at being cured. 
 Molly. 
 It's okay. Just... just give her a minute. 
 I asked you to let me handle this. 
 Molly had ten seconds to process her husband's lymphoma, and you're discussing survival rates. 
 I know. But he was desperate and he asked me, so I had to honor that. 
 We had a deal. 
 You said you would funnel everything through me, that I would tell them, I would soften the blow. 
 But you didn't. 
 And now look what happened. You told them he could die. 
 You made it worse, Conrad. You made it so much worse. 
 I understand. 
 You're not mad at me. You're mad at cancer. 
 You're scared for Derek. 
 You're scared Molly will fall apart, or that you will. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 But that poor man. That poor, darling man, he doesn't deserve this. No, he doesn't. 
 No one does. 
 But you and I... we're gonna do everything we can. 
 And when we're done, I know you will be strong enough to put yourself and everyone else back together. 
 
 
 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm fine. I know you are. 
 And for the record, I absolutely can be mad at cancer and you. 
 I gave her 0.5 of lorazepam, but it didn't work. 
 And I-I didn't know what to do. 
 She's been seizing for nearly a minute. 
 All right, give her another two milligrams. 
 Turn her up to 100% O2. 
 Okay. She's settling. 
 She's in V tach. Get the crash cart, pull up 300 of amio. 
 We're gonna save this woman's life just so she can die again when the family pulls the plug. 
 If they pull the plug. She's not DNR. We have to save her. 
 It's not right. I know, Devon, but we don't have a choice. 
 We're torturing her. 
 She's coding. We have to bag her. 
 All right. 
 I'm sorry. No, Molly... 
 I ran out of the room just when Derek needed me most. 
 I was thinking of myself. 
 I fell apart when I should have been strong. 
 That's all I ever do. 
 And that's why you're telling doctors not to talk in front of me. 
 Letting my sick husband hear about his condition, but not his totally healthy, medically trained, "should be able to handle it" wife. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 I know sometimes I try to protect you like you're still a kid, but that's my mistake. 
 Look at you. 
 You're in your second year of med school, top of your class. 
 You have a wonderful child, a strong marriage and I am endlessly proud of you. 
 Sometimes I think, without him, I couldn't breathe. 
 He's my rock. 
 You may not see this, but you're his rock, too. 
 All right, Chu. We're looking at an hour or less with Mr. Landry here. Roger that. 
 10 blade to me. 
 All right. Let's give this team owner a new lease on life, shall we? 
 Uh, all right, Chu, let's make it 90 minutes. 
 There's a country mile of scar tissue in this bad boy. 
 90 minutes. Got it. 
 Retractor. 
 Make that two hours. 
 Uh, in fact, you know what? Make it four. 
 It's like tissue paper in here. 
 You know, I'm gonna need another set of hands. 
 I'll page Dr. Singh. 
 Actually... make it Dr. Bell. 
 Bell? Is he still full-time here? 
 Check the cafeteria. And when you find him, tell him not to let it get to his head, but I need him in my OR, stat. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 Well, I just saved a woman's life. A woman who, by all rights, should be long dead, so... 
 Anyway, you paged. What's up? 
 Told Dr. Voss that you used to be a chemo nurse, and that you were great at it. The best, is what I actually said. 
 We fill the patient with toxins and hope it only kills the bad stuff. 
 It's hell on them. I know. 
 And it can take its toll on you, as well. 
 Yeah, I mean, the oncologists, they just give the orders. 
 The nurses stay with the patients, watch them struggle. 
 It's... it's heartbreaking. 
 You don't have to do it. 
 No, it's okay. 
 For Kit, her family, anything. 
 How about we get a family member to sit with you, track how you feel? 
 That way you don't have to spend extra energy communicating with the nurses. 
 That would be me. 
 Sorry I'm late. The vending machine line was crazy. 
 I read snacks are important during chemo sessions. 
 Sweet or salty? Sweet. 
 Are you comfortable? 
 I-I ordered pillows. 
 I'm good. Really. 
 I know you are. 
 You're always good. 
 In fact, you're the bravest person I've ever met. 
 But today, you focus on getting better, and I'll handle the rest. 
 Come here. It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Come here. I know. 
 I'm so sorry. I know... 
 We got this, okay? 
 I promise. 
 I love unicorns. 
 What's going on with Mom? 
 Do you mind if, um, just you and I talk? Of course, yeah. 
 I'll meet you guys in the waiting room, okay? 
 Waiting room, okay? 
 I don't know exactly how to say this to you, but... your mother, she's... she's not really there anymore. 
 What do you mean? 
 We haven't measured any type of meaningful brain activity, and we haven't for some time now. 
 Now, I know that we were holding out hope for a miracle. 
 I truly, truly believed that it was gonna happen. 
 But the chances are getting slimmer by the day. 
 You think we should let her go? 
 Your mother's fought a good fight. 
 And we all love her. 
 We did our best to heal her, but... 
 ... yes, it's time. 
 Um... 
 How would it happen? 
 Would you just... turn off all her machines? 
 Yes, we'd make sure she's comfortable. 
 We'll give her some morphine, so she doesn't feel any pain. 
 You can have a ceremony right here in the room. 
 Just the family. 
 Can I arrange that for you? 
 Okay. 
 Done and done. 
 What made you change your mind? 
 Multiple previous abdominal surgeries. 
 There's scar tissue everywhere, man. 
 I can barely lyse the adhesions without tearing into the intestines. 
 This is a mess. 
 Tell me about it. 
 This could take till daybreak, you know? 
 You got someplace to be? 
 I'm a surgeon. 
 Where would I have to be? 
 Retractor to me. 
 Uh, Nic, I think he's shivering. 
 Well, that's normal with chemo. Here. 
 Are his Ts peaking? 
 Let me print an EKG. 
 And get Conrad in here. 
 We're just checking with the doctor. 
 I'm sure you're fine. 
 You're right... good catch. 
 Let's get a crash cart in here, come on! 
 Push one gram of calcium gluconate. 
 Derek, honey, it's gonna be fine... I'm right here. 
 Derek wasn't shivering, he's twitching. 
 He must be hypocalcemic. 
 And with his high potassium, he's in danger of cardiac arrest. He's in TLS. 
 Let's get the pacer pads on him now! 
 Give him ten units of insulin, an amp of D-50 and an amp of bicarb. Derek has Tumor Lysis Syndrome. 
 As the chemo kills his cancer cells... 
 Dying cells release toxins into his blood and organs. 
 In other words, the cure could kill him. 
 So we have a catch-22. 
 Before his first round of chemo's complete, we need to give him fluids in order to prevent his kidneys from failing. 
 But doing that puts his lungs in danger of filling with fluid again. 
 It's gonna be touch-and-go till sunrise.

 Man, I thought we'd lost him when that tear in his IVC opened up, but your patchwork using peritoneum? 
 Good work, my brother. 
 Can you imagine if we killed the owner of Atlanta's soccer team? 
 We'd be run out of Georgia. 
 Listen, man, my apologies about the surprise marathon. 
 But if it wasn't for you, old Landry would be spending the rest of his life drinking his meals through straws. 
 There's no apologies necessary. 
 I, you know... 
 I haven't pushed myself that hard in... years. 
 Just exhausting. 
 But exhilarating. 
 I got to go. 
 Oh, so you're really gonna walk away from all this, huh? 
 This is who I am. 
 I'm a surgeon... it doesn't mean we're one-trick ponies, AJ. 
 With a show I can reach more people. 
 I can do a lot of good, I... 
 And yet here you are, after a brutal surgery like this one, glowing like an intern on his first day of rotation. 
 He's been up and down all night. 
 Didn't eat, he said he was cold. 
 Dr. Hawkins told me you caught Derek's potassium spike. 
 You know, you might have saved his life. 
 We'll see. 
 He's afebrile. Um... 
 BP looks good. 
 Electrolytes are stabilized. 
 He made it through his first round of chemo. 
 Ah! 
 Good morning! 
 Good morning, good morning. 
 Uh, sorry if I look a little ragged. 
 I had a... big night last night. 
 Uh, we performed an unexpected overnight surgery. 
 The patient had a dozen bowel obstructions over the years, and every time he went in for a repair, he lost a little bit of his intestine. 
 Before I bring out our-our scheduled guest, I-I'd like you to meet that patient. 
 So please say hello to the owner of the Georgia FC Soccer Club, Bill Landry! 
 Bill, how are you feeling? 
 Any soreness, nausea? Yeah. 
 A little pain around my stitches. 
 Still pretty tuckered out. 
 Well, that's, as we discussed, because your intestine ruptured, and you were open all night while we repaired it. 
 You'll be back watching Georgia FC with a beer and burgers in no time. 
 Although I cannot recommend the burger. 
 The beer... in moderation. 
 Dr. Bell, I don't know how to thank you, but I'm sure gonna try. 
 I'd like to offer you and your audience members tickets to this week's match against United FC. 
 Wow. 
 They seem pretty happy, Bill. 
 That's very generous, thank you so much. 
 So that's what you'll get when you tune into The Dr. Bell Show. 
 I will bring my hospital into your living room. 
 Real patients, real stories. 
 Which only an actively working doctor can bring you. 
 And now, before we go to break... 
 Mr. Landry? 
 If you need a doctor, just ring the Bell! 
 Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell! 
 Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell! 
 Ring the Bell! 
 Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell! 
 Ring the Bell! 
 So, Dawn Long has passed on and the Mother of All Surgeries is now officially a success. 
 Great work. 
 I'll draft a press release. 
 Yes, this is Dr. Cain. Dr. Cain, this is Dr. Vincent down in microbiology. 
 I have Dawn Long's blood culture results. 
 Ah, yes. Unfortunately, Dawn Long has passed away, so there's no need. 
 A-Actually, you're gonna want to hear this. 
 Your patient had Candida auris. 
 The superbug? 
 Exactly. The hospital will have to lock down the patient room, sterilize it from top to bottom. 
 Anybody who'd come into contact with Ms. Long will have to take extreme precautions. 
 Okay, thanks for the call. I'll handle it. 
 I-I don't need to remind you, Dr. Cain, but once Candida auris spreads throughout a building, it's nearly impossible to eradicate. 
 A superbug like this can destroy a hospital. 
 What is it? 
 Hey! 
 Barrett! 
 Good morning, Dr. Cain. 
 Logan. 
 We have a problem.
