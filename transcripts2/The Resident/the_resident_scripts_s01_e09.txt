 How are your surgical error and complication rates? 
 Transparency and accountability force us to weed out the bad and grow the good. 
 How you doing today, Lily? Dr. Hunter caught my cancer when other doctors missed it. 
 She's the only person that I trust.

 The chemo was so strong this time. 
 I think it's gonna kill me. 
 I mean, she almost gave me that bone marrow transplant. 
 I wouldn't have survived it, right? 
 Probably not, because your kidneys were impaired. 
 But she said it was the only way to save my life, and-and now she's saying that this last round of chemo could cure me, but... both those things can't be true, can they? 
 Lily, remember when I suggested you get a second opinion? 
 You can still do it... a different oncologist can examine your whole case and make sure the doses and drugs you're getting are appropriate... Nic can give you a referral. 
 She worked for a great oncologist, Dr. Osder. 
 (PAGER BEEPING) Yes, and I would trust her with my life.

 Welcome back. You fainted from the pain. 
 We've given you some morphine. You should be feeling better. 
 Thank heavens you were here. 
 What has it been? Like, ten years? 
 (SIGHS) Eleven. 
 Not that I'm counting. 
 I just moved back to Atlanta last month. 
 I heard that you were, um, working here. 
 When did the pain start? 
 (SIGHS) It's been off and on for about a-a month. 
 I haven't been able to keep anything down, and then, last night, it just became unbearable. 
 My husband's been away, so I was all alone. 
 It's lower. 
 (CATHERINE LAUGHS) 
 I remember when you got that... in El Paso. 
 We stole my mom's car, and drove all night. 
 Mm. We were gonna hit Mexico and keep going. 
 I didn't even have my driver's license. 
 I don't know if I've ever done anything more romantic. 
 That joy ride got me a one-way ticket to military school, but I liked it better than living with my dad. 
 CATHERINE: Remember when he called me trailer trash? 
 He'd eat his words now. You look amazing. 
 Hey. Catherine, this is Nurse Practitioner Nic Nevin. 
 Nic, Catherine Loy. 
 We're admitting her for acute abdominal pain. 
 Oh, I'm sorry to hear. Nice to meet you, Catherine. 
 We're old friends. 
 Oh, it's a bit more complicated than that. 
 Conrad was my fiancé. 
 I haven't seen Catherine in 11 years. 
 She's happily married. 
 Can we talk about this? You mean the fact that there's this whole other part of your life that you never mentioned? 
 Nope, not my business. Nic. 
 Let's talk about Dr. Hunter. 
 Okay. What about her? 
 Lily's finally safe. Dr. Osder will take care of her, but what about her other patients? 
 You're the only one who can keep an eye on them since she doesn't trust Devon anymore. 
 Fine. Leave it to me. I'll do whatever I have to do to stay in her good graces. Cool. Thanks. 
 That's a great idea. Terrific, yeah...

 Lane? Lane? 
 Do you got a second? 
 Of course. What can I do for you? 
 (SIGHS) I owe you an apology. 
 I undercut you with your patient. 
 I encouraged him to stop treatment when you still had help to offer. 
 I was way out of line. It's been bothering me a lot. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (SIGHS) I've been thinking a lot about that case, too. 
 I always say, never give up, but sometimes, I ought to. 
 I don't agree. 
 You've pulled off some miraculous cures. 
 I've also seen a lot of people that should have gone home die alone in our ICU, getting chemo that wasn't working. 
 The tricky part is that you just never know who can beat the odds. 
 Trying to make that call must be incredibly hard on you. 
 It is... actually. 
 No one thinks about the effect on doctors when they have to watch their patients suffer. 
 That bone marrow transplant I almost gave to Lily... 
 I wake up in a cold sweat every night thinking about it. 
 No one is perfect. I have to be. 
 There's too much at stake.

 You're pregnant. 
 Are you sure? (CHUCKLES) 
 I'm positive. 
 Oh, my God, that's fantastic. 
 We've been trying for almost two years. 
 We even tried IVF, but nothing worked. 
 I cannot wait to... tell my husband. 
 Excellent. 
 The OB team is coming in to make sure all is well with the baby. 
 They'll do an ultrasound, see how far along you are. 
 Check the baby's heart. 
 I'm also ordering an X-ray to check your abdomen. 
 Is that... is that safe for the baby? 
 Absolutely. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Conrad... you have no idea what this means to me. 
 I have a damn good idea. 
 We both came from broken families. You always wanted kids of your own. 
 (EXHALES) 
 I'm so happy for you. 
 Go on. 
 Ask me anything. I know you want to. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 (EXHALES) 
 Why didn't you marry her? 
 (SIGHS) 
 She left me after I punched my father in the nose at the rehearsal dinner. Wow. 
 He told Catherine I didn't really love her and that the marriage was gonna be a disaster, so I decked him. 
 Right in front of the guests, including her family. 
 No, you didn't. I did. 
 And I had a fine time doing it, but... 
 Kate was afraid he was right. 
 And how do you feel about her now? 
 (SIGHS) I did love her. 
 I don't love her anymore. 
 But I care about her very much, and I want to fix her.

 Priya's here. 
 I don't think you've formally met yet. 
 Priya, this is Dr. Conrad Hawkins and Nic Nevin. 
 Thank you for helping us, Priya. Of course. 
 Priya is a journalist, and she's researching a cancer cluster for a story. 
 I asked her if she could find any information on Dr. Hunter's patients. 
 I used social media posts to find people Dr. Hunter treated, and I ended up talking to about 15 people. 
 What did you find? All of them had good things to say about Dr. Hunter. 
 Many repeated the same line. "She saved my life." 
 DEVON: Did any of the patients have health problems that were caused by the doses? 
 Two had heart damage. 
 One was infertile. Bone density decreased. 
 One man lost all his teeth. 
 None of that is unusual with chemo. 
 PRIYA: The most amazing thing I found was four patients had a total remission for cancers that are considered incurable. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 NIC: I don't believe it. 
 Total remissions for cancers that are incurable? 
 I mean, it sounds incredible. 
 And it does show we have a steep hill to climb. 
 Miraculous cures can be used to justify her doses. 
 I get it. She's your mentor. 
 But you got to trust me. I talked to her, and she seemed genuinely crushed by the error she almost made with Lily. She cried, Nic. 
 She cried? She is an excellent liar. Yes. 
 And she will be just that good on the stand if we get that far. 
 We have to be careful. Lane is highly respected. 
 She makes millions of dollars for Chastain. 
 If we take her on and lose, our careers will be over. 
 I can't believe you're worried about your career right now. 
 All I'm saying is, if by some chance that second opinion comes back in Lane's favor, don't do anything until we get more information. 
 People could be dyind and you want me to wait for more information? 
 I thought you knew me better than that. 
 But then again, why should I be surprised? Since, apparently, I never really knew you either. 
 DEVON: It's too good to be true. Something's wrong here. 
 Then I'll dig deeper. 
 And I'll cheer you up at dinner. 
 Do you have anything special planned? 
 Today's the 28th, right? 
 30th. 
 Oh, Priya, you should've said something. I've been so busy at work I completely lost track of time. 
 Happy birthday. 
 Whoa.

 You're so asking the wrong person. 
 I could order flowers, but... 
 I don't know... it's not enough. It's her birthday. 
 I don't understand about birthdays. 
 What does it matter what day you were born? 
 It matters to every woman I've ever known. 
 Not this one. 
 Mina, have you ever been in love? 
 Don't do that. Don't ask stupid questions. 
 Too personal? No, no, not personal. 
 I said "stupid." You're a doctor. You should know that romantic love is just a trick the brain plays on you to get you to pump out babies. 
 (KEYBOARD CLACKING) 
 Thank you for coming to meet with me, Randolph. 
 It's always a pleasure, Claire. What can I do for you? 
 Well, after our last board meeting, I did some digging and found out we're doing a really poor job at monitoring our own errors. 
 Surgical errors can be easily covered up just by saying that they're complications. Well... (SIGHS) 
 I think you can trust the doctors at Chastain. 
 Apparently not. According to Medscape, 21% of physicians feel it's okay to hide a mistake that harms a patient under certain circumstances. 
 That is shocking. Isn't it? 
 So I have decided to shine a light on the physicians that have the highest rate of complications and get rid of them. 
 That's a radical move. 
 You know, to be brutally honest, we cannot handle one more lawsuit. 
 How can I help? 
 I have installed recording devices on every camera in every OR. 
 Starting today, there will be no hiding from problematic performances or outcomes. 
 After you've rested a bit, Dr. Pravesh is gonna place a nasogastric tube that will empty the contents of your stomach. 
 It should relieve the pain and hopefully resolve the blockage. 
 DEVON: It's not a pleasant procedure, but there is a good chance that it'll make it possible for you to avoid surgery. 
 Let's redraw another set of labs, and page me as soon as we have the results. 
 Nic is gonna take great care of you. 
 Thank you so much. We'll catch up more later. 
 Okay.

 A real rebel. 
 Which was, um, part of the appeal. 
 But he was always emotionally distant. 
 He, um... wouldn't let me in. 
 Sounds like he hasn't changed at all. 
 No, he has. 
 He's so, um... so grown-up and, um, responsible and... gentle. Well, that is because you're his patient. 
 Okay, you're gonna feel... a little prick here. 
 There we go.

 What makes you say that? 
 You're, um...

 Rough road, indeed.

 Of course. 
 I'll get you everything from her current treatment plan. 
 Well, you know as well as I do that won't be sufficient. 
 I'll need everything going back to her original diagnosis and the doctor who first referred her. 
 Absolutely. Not a problem.

 Dr. Pravesh, please help me.

 It's okay. You're safe now. 
 Nurse Nevin. Can we talk for a moment? 
 Sure. I was wondering if you would take over supervising Lily's care again. 
 Starting immediately. 
 I don't understand. 
 I-I know. 
 We started off on the wrong foot, and it was entirely my fault. 
 These last few weeks, I've come to realize that you're one of the finest nurse practitioners we have at Chastain. 
 Lily needs you. 
 And she deserves to have you. 
 Well, I'd do anything for Lily. 
 Thank you. 
 (SIGHS) Thanks for coming in on your day off. Yeah, of course, man. 
 She's about six weeks pregnant, so you'll need to be extra careful around the uterus. I know what I'm doing. 
 Nic told me all about her, okay? Don't stress. 
 I looked at the imaging. 
 I'll lyse the adhesions, remove any of the unhealthy segments, and she can be home in a couple days. 
 Wait. 
 About Nic... 
 Two women left me for the same reason. 
 You deserve Nic. 
 You can give her what I can't. 
 Thank you. 
 All right.

 We almost lost her. 
 What happened?

 In their defense, it was entwined with the bowel. 
 That's super rare. One in a 100,000? 
 Mina's gonna write it up as a case report. 
 Lily? She's doing better. 
 You here all night? 
 Yeah, I'll stay for them both. 
 Hey, Conrad? 
 Yeah. 
 When did your mom give you this ring? 
 When I left for Afghanistan. 
 Why didn't you tell me it belonged to her? 
 I wanted you to feel like it was yours alone. 
 She said, "Give it to the love of your life." 
 (SIGHS) 
 You want it back? 
 No. 
 You earned it.

 (COOKIE WHINING) (LILY LAUGHS SOFTLY) 
 (WHINES) 
 Look at you sitting up. 
 And is that a smile? 
 Please, can I hold it? 
 Oh, my God, Cookie. I've been looking for this little girl all day. (WHINING) 
 Hello. Come here, baby. 
 That's her name? Cookie? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, this goes against all rules, but I don't care. 
 Here you go. There you go. 
 Hi. (WHINING) 
 Hi. 
 Can I keep her? 
 You can. She's all yours. 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 (COOKIE BARKS SOFTLY) 
 Hi. (LAUGHS) 
 (RHYTHMIC BEEPING, INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Uh, Nic, I need you to give Lily a liter with 40 milliequivalents of potassium. 
 You sure you want to give her that much? 
 Her renal function just started trending toward normal. 
 Thank you for being so vigilant, but low potassium levels are not good for Lily's heart. 
 Just give it to her slowly over the entire shift so she can handle it. 
 Okay. Got it. 
 I'm on my way out for the night. 
 Are you gonna be around for a while? 
 Uh, I'm done in the next 15 minutes, but I'll make sure I do this before I go. 
 Great. Thank you.
