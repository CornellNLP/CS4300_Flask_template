 Previously on The Resident... If I hadn't gotten injured, they might not have caught my cancer in time. 
 Your supplements have potential. You killed my pitch. 
 You said Chastain doesn't take chances. They don't. 
 I do. So what's your plan if Adaku's baby becomes your responsibility? 
 I don't have one. 
 Hawkins is a whistle-blower. He's a threat to the hospital. 
 I'll handle it. Dr. Hawkins, you lied to the transplant board. 
 You're fired. Give me your pager. 
 Thank you. 
 We're a high-volume outfit. 
 A lot of kitchen mishaps and food poisoning. 
 Waiting room's packed 24/7, so ten minutes per patient. And if the diagnosis isn't obvious, and it takes over ten minutes? 
 We also take pride in customer satisfaction. 
 Your bonuses are tied to it. 
 So... flexible prescribing, if you know what I mean. 
 Patients hate being told "no". 
 Yeah. Isn't that what contributed to the opioid crisis? 
 And why did you say you're not at Chastain anymore? 
 If it were easy, everyone would be a doctor, because this is the best job in the world, despite everything. 
 Because of everything. 
 How you feeling? 
 Pain-free. First time in over a decade. 
 The transplant team has been called in. 
 I will be with you every step of the way. 
 _ 
 I spent half my life without a father. 
 We're gonna fix that. 
 These patients need you, and I think this hospital needs doctors like both of us. 
 God, I love when you believe in me. 
 I never stopped believing in you. 
 They're firing Conrad. 
 Security will escort you out. 
 Screaming won't make this go any faster. 
 Or maybe it will. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Good morning, everyone. 
 I'm Dr. Garrison, your chief resident. 
 Welcome, second-year residents. 
 You'll be getting interns of your own today. 
 You will be their mentors, their teachers. 
 Do not hesitate to work them like pack mules. 
 The hospital relies on their cheap labor. 
 No questions. There are only two rules... no one quits, no one dies. 
 Uh, Dr. Pravesh? 
 Ezra Dreyfuss, your intern. 
 Hey, Ezra. Welcome. 
 And I'm Eline. Oh. 
 You didn't have to come. Your son's in good hands. 
 Oh, she's not my mother. I am also your intern. 
 Sorry. I-I wasn't expecting... 
 You thought I'd be older? No, no, no. I... Of course not. 
 I-I meant... 
 There are two of you. 
 Eline, Ezra. 
 I'm thrilled to welcome you to Chastain. 
 You know, on my first day as a doctor... 
 Before you go all William Wallace on us, I am highly allergic to any form of nut or dairy. 
 If I come into contact with either, I will drop dead. 
 Sorry. Please continue. 
 Got it. 
 Today will set you on the course for the rest of your lives. 
 So, when there are tough times, just remember why you decided to be a doctor. 
 Eline? 
 You ever met an intern who watched a loved one die of an incurable disease, quit work to become a caregiver, drew inspiration from the medical professionals they met throughout the disease, enrolled in medical school and became a doctor? 
 If that person is you, then... then, yes, I have. 
 That person is not me. 
 Oh. I was teaching math to a bunch of third-grade terrorists, and I was deeply inspired to get the hell out of there. Wow. 
 That's hilarious. Okay, my turn. 
 Pravesh, need you and your children in Bay 3. 
 Thank you. 
 Odel. Dr. Pravesh. 
 If it's okay with you, I'd like to have my interns observe. 
 Of course. 
 So, uh, I've had this cough for a few weeks now. 
 Okay. Just the cough? Just the cough. 
 It's called an emergency room. 
 I know, but I'm going to Cambodia tomorrow, so I thought I'd have it checked out, and I didn't want to end up in some remote village clinic if it got worse. 
 Okay. Let me take a look. Deep breath. 
 I backpacked through Cambodia in college. 
 You are gonna love it. Yeah? 
 I have been to England once with the symphony, and that's about it. 
 Atlanta Symphony? Yeah. I play cello. 
 You ever play with Gianni Balissa? 
 He taught me everything I know. Me, too. 
 I was honorary recipient of the Sousa Band Award for the violin. 
 Let me guess. You're a musical genius. 
 Uh... yeah. Yeah. 
 Dr. Pravesh! 
 Scooter versus fire hydrant, we need you. 
 Beethoven, you're with me. 
 Eline, I want you to finish doing a full physical exam on Odel, and report back to me when you're done. 
 You have got to be kidding me. I don't think he is. 
 More than half of hospitals pay doctors based on relative value units instead of set salaries. 
 Think of it as capitalism. 
 The more procedures, biopsies, test diagnostic surgeries you do, the more money you'll make; it's that simple. 
 So, what, are we car salesmen now? 
 Commission-based pay systems lead to rampant overtreatment. 
 I've seen it myself. You concerned we'll all see how you really measure up, Dr. Austin? 
 Maybe you're not as valuable to the hospital as you think you are. 
 Well, depending on your values, you might be right, Dr. Cain. 
 This isn't a discussion, it's Red Rock policy from now on. 
 You'll be paid for the volume of work you do. 
 And quality is irrelevant. 
 Nobody said that. 
 Neither of you had to. 
 Don't worry, Dr. B. 
 You won't be out here with the minnows for too long. 
 I can feel it in my heart space. 
 Ooh, sorry. Sorry, it's for my new boss. 
 What's the meeting about? 
 Just boring pay stuff. 
 Nothing like what's arranged for you tonight. 
 Grayson, you don't run my schedule anymore. 
 Well, my dad hasn't caught on yet, and he called me to tell you... now, don't hug the messenger... but, Dr. B., you're about to present 3B Life to the U.S. of A. 
 So suit up and get camera-ready, 'cause you're gonna be on TV. 
 Oh, he got the spot on Montel? 
 Better. STV, baby. 
 Shopping Television? 
 I mean, this is incredible. This could make our... our supplement line an industry player. 
 It all depends on you, though, so get that face ready for the small screen. 
 There she is. Nurse among nurses. 
 It's so good to see you, Finn. 
 Oh... How's the book coming? 
 Published. Yeah, and not self-published, either. 
 Real published. Smell the ink. 
 That's amazing. Congrats. 
 I hear you and Hawkins live together now. 
 Sounds like Dr. Feldman gave you an update. 
 I hope he's a tidy roommate. Mm, getting there. 
 Yeah. Wow. 
 All the details of the life of Finn. 
 Flip to page three. 
 _ 
 I'm pretty sure you're responsible for beating the odds. 
 Uh, where's Conrad? I've got a copy for him, too, so... 
 He's not here anymore. 
 No, he practically lives here. 
 Well, I'm covering for him. 
 Which means I have your test results. 
 I wish I had better news. 
 I've reached my final chapter. 
 My lung function's deteriorating, which means I'll be on a breathing machine soon, and then will go the way of all my friends with Duchenne. 
 I am so sorry. 
 Well, bad news is no stranger when you have a body like mine. 
 I know where I am. 
 Which is why I'm here. 
 I want to do something crazy with the little time I have left. 
 What are you planning, Finn? 
 Hey. Hey. 
 One of your favorite patients is here. Finn Niver. 
 How is he? As feisty as ever. 
 But, um... 
 This is the end, isn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 I need to see him. 
 Well, that can be arranged. 
 You know I can't set foot inside there. 
 Well, not at Chastain. 
 There's something that Finn wants to do, and he needs a doctor to do it with him. 
 I'm listening. 
 How do you feel about space travel? 
 You eat, sleep, and breathe this place, and the day I need you most, I find out you don't work here anymore? 
 What happened? 
 Ah, it's a long story, Finn. 
 Someone was a bit cagey on the phone about why I'm needed, so... 
 All I said was it's a beautiful day to ditch gravity. 
 Good one. Nice work, Nevin. 
 What are we talking about? Skydiving? 
 Hell no. I have been tied to this chair since I was five years old; I want out. 
 I want to fly. I want to float like I own the place. 
 In zero-g. 
 Zero gravity? 
 I sent a pandering letter to the company that does zero-g flights, and they gifted tickets for me and a doctor of my choosing. 
 So, you in? 
 Guys... it is definitely crazy. 
 Which is exactly why I'm in! 
 Yes! Oh, let's do it. 
 I know this is as much for me as it is for Finn, and... I appreciate it. 
 I had nothing to do with it. It was all Finn's idea. 
 Have fun. 
 Mom calls them brain damage on wheels. 
 In her ICU in Boston, a quarter of the beds are always filled with scooter patients. 
 So I got off easy? Because you were wearing a helmet. 
 So, how's it going with Odel? 
 He really wanted answers, so I called Pulmonology for a consult. 
 Dr. Langford recommended a bronchoscopy just to be sure. He has a cough with clear lungs and a normal chest X-ray. 
 He didn't need a Pulmonology consult. 
 The patient wanted one. 
 And he's about to travel. I was in Nairobi once, caught this nasty parasite and, um... Both of you, follow me. 
 Okay. 
 Well, guess we're too late. 
 Can I help you with something, Dr. Pravesh? 
 This procedure is unnecessary. 
 Step out, please. This is now my patient. 
 O2 sat is dropping. 
 He's aspirating. 
 Turn up the suction. Get him on 100% O2 and abort the bronch. 
 Wh-What's happening? He's choking on his own vomit. 
 No invasive procedure is completely safe. 
 You have to weigh the danger of a simple cough against an unintended consequence like this one. 
 Yikes. 
 He's stable. 
 That's something. But he has to be admitted. 
 He's on supplemental oxygen and will need antibiotics to treat the aspiration pneumonia caused by an unnecessary bronchoscopy. 
 He wanted answers. I consulted an experienced pulmonologist who suggested the bronchoscopy. 
 Which is a relatively benign procedure with good diagnostic yield. Stop. 
 It's simple. 
 You made a mistake. 
 You need to accept responsibility, learn and move on. 
 You read Annie Diamonte's chart? 
 Yes. I recommend you start with the good news and finish with the bad. 
 Well, I prefer to close on the positive. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 You know, we really have to stop meeting like this. 
 You know, as much as I enjoy seeing you, Annie, I agree. 
 I was really hoping that last chest tube would have taken care of it, but your CT scan shows that you still have what's called an empyema, an infection between your lung and your chest, which is what's causing your fevers. 
 But there's good news. 
 We saw your scan... 
 ... and no sign of cancer. 
 The immunotherapy is working. 
 What? 
 My cancer's gone? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, you know, you really should have led with that. 
 I was gonna tell you to stop the drugs and let me go. 
 So... so what's the plan? 
 I mean, another chest tube? New antibiotic? 
 Well, we are actually here to talk to you about another option. A decortication. 
 We open your chest, then we clear the infection, and we scrape off the peel that's trapping your lung, which is what's making it hard for you to breathe. 
 What could go wrong? 
 Plenty. 
 This is a very high-risk surgery. 
 There's a high likelihood of bleeding, which could be catastrophic, particularly given the trauma you've already been through from the explosion. 
 And even if Dr. Austin is able to do the surgery successfully, your lung may never reexpand. 
 What are my alternatives? 
 I mean, I live my life in and out of here, sick and in limbo, buy my time till I die? 
 I can't do that. 
 And if my cancer's in remission, I have a shot at getting my life back. 
 You do understand the risks of surgery? 
 Yeah. Well, whatever they are, I'll take my chances. 
 Oh, wow. 
 ... for yourself or for someone else, this is something... 
 I'm gone a matter of weeks, you're in the servants' quarters, and my son, one of the best doctors at Chastain, is fired? 
 I'm not responsible for that. 
 Obviously. 
 Conrad is dodging my calls. 
 His way of asking me to stand down. 
 Hmm. Well, stand down. My lawyers are submitting a whistleblower suit. 
 You know how many are filed every year? 
 Whistleblower protection is a joke in Georgia. 
 I'll tell you what'll happen. 
 Red Rock will sue you for libel, and they may win. 
 So I'm taking advice from a guy who's lost two jobs in two weeks? Yeah. 
 Being demoted by these people is an honor. 
 How do we fight back? 
 Well, you got a slingshot? 
 Look, all due respect, don't go down that path until you have a bulletproof strategy. Oh, I've got one. 
 Well, if you're hell-bent on moving forward, then I suggest... you have a look at Logan Kim. 
 Thanks. 
 Dr. Austin. 
 Watch the coat. It's custom. 
 I don't like wrinkles. 
 Well, here's one. I'm reviewing mortality outcomes of all surgeons, and you're an outlier. 
 Your stats aren't up to par. 
 And as chief, your outcomes are now my outcomes. 
 Come on, bruh. Everybody knows that my outcomes are excellent for the kind of cases I take. 
 My patients are the sickest. My surgeries, risky. 
 Which is precisely my point. 
 Annie Diamonte's upcoming surgery is too much of a long shot. 
 You need to reassess. Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Hold up. 
 You don't want me to do a highly profitable procedure? 
 The crème de la crème of RVUs? I'm only suggesting that you have a plan B. 
 An escape hatch, so to speak. 
 Oh. So if something catastrophic were to happen, you want me to keep her alive at all costs, not let her die on my table, just to pad my stats. What I'm saying to you, Dr. Austin, is that your statistics don't meet what I expect from my surgeons. 
 So, yes, you keep her alive at all costs and don't mention a DNR to your patient. 
 As the plane descends, we'll vary the flight profiles so you can feel the weightlessness of both martian and lunar gravity. 
 So this isn't a free fall. 
 That's Kimmy. 
 She makes these crazy videos in the best way. 
 She may be a living emoji. 
 Shh. You'll also experience... 
 And that's Reggie Perez. 
 Retired Atlanta United defender, 2015 to 2017. 
 Hey, you're in good company, Finn, but they got nothing on you. 
 You're the real badass here. 
 Don't ever forget that. 
 You'll experience 15 simulations in total in increments of about 30 seconds a pop. 
 Most people think that zero-g is only experienced when the plane is in a dive. Hey, Reggie. 
 Yeah. 
 I was MVP of the Golden Kickers till my career ended at age five. 
 But mini-me could have taken mini-you down. 
 I don't doubt it for a second, bud. 
 Well, once we're weightless, it's an even playing field, and I am coming for you. 
 And I'm scared. 
 I'll see you out there. 
 He said he's scared. 
 Does he look scared? 
 No. 
 Of course all the rush and excitement come with perils, like nausea. 
 It's called vomit comet for a reason. 
 But there are also other risks, including dizziness, fluctuating blood pressure. 
 There are very rare but very real complications aside from the vomit issue, of course... 
 Are you scared? 
 You can change your mind. It's totally fine if you are. 
 It's not, really. 
 'Cause then I'm gonna spend the rest of my life wondering "what if". 
 Means my final weeks would be torture, and I can't do that. 
 We'll take those signed waivers now, because it's time for zero-g, people. 
 One thing, though, doc. 
 I know you've been through a lot lately, and I don't want to make it worse. 
 Listen, if things go south up there... like really south... 
 ... don't blame yourself, okay? 
 I mean, the worst that happens up there is I die. 
 And is zero-g really the worst way to go? 
 No, it isn't. 
 We obviously want the surgery to be a success. 
 But it's risky. So we have to ask have you thought about what you want if things don't go well? 
 I've thought about it a lot since the cancer diagnosis. 
 You know, I-I love the outdoors and the physical challenges. 
 A life hooked up to a machine is no life at all for me. 
 So if that is my only choice, I want you to let me go. 
 Okay. 
 Well, then let's fill out a Do Not Resuscitate order, specifying your wishes so that everyone follows them. 
 Before I sign that, can I have a minute? 
 Sure. 
 Hey. Nic filled me in. I'm really sorry I'm not there. 
 Yeah. I heard hints as to why that is, and I don't like it. 
 Conrad, are you okay? Right now, yeah. 
 How are you? I hear cancer-free. 
 Yeah. That's amazing. 
 It is. 
 Look, I know you're not gonna sugarcoat this. 
 That's why I called you, Conrad. 
 I'm not sure I can do this. 
 Yeah, it's risky, and I'm scared as hell. 
 I know that. 
 I also know it takes a special kind of superpower to run into a fire to save a hospital and kick cancer's ass all in the same year. 
 So if anyone's got this, it's you. 
 Thanks, Conrad. I really needed to hear that. 
 Bye. 
 What's going on? 
 He was midway through the cefepime when he started to get wheezy. 
 Now he can't breathe. 
 Sounds like anaphylaxis. A reaction to the antibiotics. 
 Push 0.5 of epinephrine I.M. now and prepare an epi drip. 
 And call the code team. Help me. 
 We got you, buddy. 
 Hang in there. 
 Pressure's dropping. Let's go, let's go, let's go. 
 Let's get the pads on him. now. 
 Come on. 
 Run the code. 
 What? No, I-I ca-I can't. 
 We lost his pulse. 
 Starting compressions. 
 This is your patient. You made the call. 
 Run the code. 
 What's the first question you ask in a code? 
 What was the rhythm before he arrested? 
 It was PEA. What's the differential for a PEA arrest? 
 Eline! I can't. 
 Step aside. 
 Hold compressions. 
 He's still in PEA. 
 Restart compressions. Push 1 of epi. 
 Let's move. I'll intubate. 
 I'll get the printout. He looks better. 
 Epi usually works quickly when you give it, but his blood pressure's still low. 
 Is that real? Maybe. 
 But the monitor's just a tool. 
 I'll need an EKG to know for sure. 
 I mean, what happened back there? You just froze up. 
 Call a Code STEMI. 
 Get him to the cath lab now. He's having a heart attack. 
 What just happened? It's called a clinical cascade. 
 When one unnecessary procedure leads to many more, increasing the risk of harm from complications. Which I put into motion. 
 You couldn't have known he'd be allergic to the antibiotics. 
 That's not her fault. From the time a patient comes in to the time he is discharged, he is in your hands. 
 This man came in with a cough, and now he might die of a heart attack. I will no longer be a doctor. 
 Not exactly. You're cheap labor and Red Rock will be very forgiving. Uh, Dr. Pravesh? 
 Do you have allergies too? 
 Your neck. 
 _ 
 Ah. Slow down, Turbo. 
 Oh, I'm very close to injecting caffeine directly into my veins. 
 When do humans figure out the difference between night and day? Because Adaku's baby hasn't. 
 She was fully awake from 2:00 to 7:00 a.m., just staring at me. 
 Until I tried to put her down. 
 Then she wails like a banshee. 
 And she's supposed to eat every two hours, but what does she do almost every single time? 
 Chucks it up. 
 Have you tried cuddling? 
 What? Eating, bathing, sleeping... it's all secondary to the snuggle. 
 It affects babies on a molecular level. 
 Literally changing their DNA for the better. 
 It improves their neural development, their IQ... 
 I got it. Fine. I'll snuggle. 
 See you in there. 
 Logan Kim. Marshall Winthrop. 
 I know who you are. 
 We both know why my son Conrad was kicked out of Chastain. 
 He tried to do the right thing, so you set out to ruin him. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Who are you? 
 I believe we've already covered that. 
 No, I mean, who are you, really... the good guy you're now pretending to be, or the world heavyweight champion of hypocrites? 
 I'm here to talk about my son. 
 Take your grievance elsewhere. 
 You think you can muscle me with your power and fortune, but I know how you made that fortune, and it wasn't through random acts of kindness. 
 To get on your high horse, it was kill or be killed. 
 This isn't about me. 
 I'm making it about you. 
 James Willebrand. 
 COO of one of your first companies. 
 FCC came sniffing around. 
 But you made sure he paid dearly for ratting you out. 
 See, I know where the bodies are buried. 
 And I will dig them up to stink in the light of day and bring you to your aging knees if you ever challenge me again. 
 Don't tempt me. 
 Climbing to 20 degrees. 
 This is seriously weird. 
 Thirty. Pretty sure it's about to get weirder. 
 Forty. 
 Zero gravity. 
 Oh, hello freedom.

 I'll bet you're right. 
 Oh... 
 I'm messing with you, Hawkins. 
 Aw... I'm sorry. 
 I-I've been planning that one all day, but you should've seen your face. 
 You got me. 
 You got me. He got you good. 
 Aw, you got me! 
 See you sometime. 
 Scalpel. 
 I-I can't see where to start cutting. 
 All right. Let's turn the lung over and go to the other side. 
 Agreed. Now, Mina, grab the peel with a hemostat. 
 Make sure you use the blunt end of the forceps. 
 
 
 
 Okay. I got it. I see healthy lung underneath. 
 You know, Cain was breathing down my neck about my stats earlier. 
 He told me to keep Annie alive at all costs. 
 Must be an open bed at the vent farm. 
 What's that? Atlanta Promised Care. 
 That's where he sends all his... "saves". 
 Oh, so that's how he keeps his stats up and the money flowing. His escape hatch. 
 That's one point of view. Is there another? 
 Well, for every ten patients we send to APC, maybe one might make it home. 
 Those aren't great numbers, but it's a chance, right? 
 But for Cain, that's not what it's about and you know it. 
 Ah! Damn it. 
 A bleeder. Hey, Chu, you get to work on her pressure, man. 
 And order up some more blood. We're gonna need it. 
 There's too much bleeding. I can't see. 
 Chu, hang another unit, please. I've already used everything we have up here, another cooler's on the way. 
 Suction. 
 Should we inflate the lung again? 
 No, it's not gonna help. 
 If-if she codes... 
 You let her go. To hell with Cain. 
 But that's not gonna happen because... You have a plan. 
 Of course I have a plan. 
 There's too much damage to the lung. 
 We need to remove the whole lobe. 
 Is that gonna leave her with enough lung function? 
 It better. Let's get to work. 
 Pressure's stable. Good deal. 
 All right, Dr. Okafor. It's all you. 
 Show me what you got. With pleasure. 
 Oh, yeah! 
 Ooh, nice one, Hawkins. 
 You okay, man? 
 Reggie, can you hear me? 
 Tell the pilot to level out. 
 Reggie's in cardiac arrest. We need a defibrillator. 
 Captain, we have... 
 Flip upside down and put your feet up on the wall. 
 Over here! 
 We need a defibrillator. 
 Let's hold him down. 
 Here we go. 
 Returning to Earth's gravity now. 
 Conrad. 
 Clear. 
 You're good. You're good. 
 He's back. 
 We did it. 
 Deploying the stent. Odel's clogged artery is about to be opened, and this cascade will transform into more of a trickle. 
 If he'd gone to a Cambodian doctor in a village, they would've given him a tea and sent him on his way. 
 Instead he came here with a cough and I gave him a heart attack. 
 And that is what's gonna make you a good doctor. 
 Giving patients heart attacks? 
 Humility. 
 Acceptance. 
 Those are the main ingredients in being one. 
 He might have coronary artery disease that was undiagnosed and exacerbated during zero-g. 
 Tell Dr. Feldman to give cardiology a heads-up that a V fib arrest with ROSC is coming in. Copy that. 
 Reggie's gonna be okay, right? 
 I believe so. 
 'Cause, you know, I'd feel weird talking about how insanely awesome that zero-g experience was, right, if... 
 He's in great hands. It's not weird. 
 Oh, dude, how freaking cool was that?! 
 I believed you when you said we'd be floating, but I guess I didn't really believe you, because when we started to rise up... 
 You-you almost peed yourself? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, me too! 
 Except for me wouldn't be the first time, so no biggie, but that was incredible. 
 Yeah. Yeah, it was. Thank you for dragging me out there. I really needed this badly. 
 Oh. 
 Hey. You okay, man? 
 I mean, really. 
 I was so happy. 
 I had my work and the most amazing woman in my life. 
 They gave me purpose. 
 I don't know who I am right now. 
 Or who I'll be if I can't be a doctor anymore. 
 I do know whatever that version of me looks like, there's no way Nic deserves that. 
 No. 
 No? 
 No, you cannot let them win. 
 Medicine is money, and money breeds jerks. 
 But you... you got to knuckle up and get your job back. 
 Hey, if not for yourself, then do it for the patients who are relying on you. 
 Get mad. 
 Go kick some Red Rock ass. 
 'Cause we are the Zero-G Brothers, and nobody... and I mean nobody... can keep us down. 
 All right? 
 Zero-G Brothers? 
 Yeah. 
 For life. 
 You know what? 
 Guys like us... 
 ... find a way to beat the odds. 
 Don't get too excited. 
 She'll be off that vent shortly. 
 So you'll have to find another patient to fill your open bed. 
 What's an empty bed cost you... another overpriced painting? 
 I remind you that I am the chief. 
 And with your stats, you're expendable. 
 Well, I'd like to remind you of something you've apparently forgotten. 
 The sacred contract between a surgeon and a patient. 
 That which distinguishes us from all other physicians. 
 We cut people open. 
 We inflict wounds to make them better. 
 They trust us with their lives. 
 And I don't cut for the sake of cutting. 
 I don't do it for the prestige or the cash or the stats or the RVUs. 
 I do it for the patients. 
 I do it for people like her. 
 You must have been different once. 
 What happened to you, Barrett? 
 I was born the man I am today, and I'm proud of it. 
 No. No, I... I think you're lying. 
 You encouraged this woman to sign a DNR when I explicitly told you not to. 
 You will not disobey me again. 
 Or what? 
 You'll have me fired, like Hawkins? 
 Demoted, like Bell? 
 What's the endgame, Barrett? 
 You cut all your adversaries, surround yourself with bootlickers and those who toe the line. 
 Yeah, it'll work for a hot minute, but I guarantee you it will breed resentment, corruption. 
 And eventually Chastain will implode, and you right along with it. 
 I told him going to the ER was a crazy idea. 
 It's a good thing he didn't listen. 
 It's just lucky it happened here at Chastain, where we have a world-class cardiac team. 
 That is lucky. 
 Honey... 
 Did the bronchoscopy explain why I have this damn cough? 
 Postnasal drip. 
 Which is what I saw when I first examined you in the ER. 
 But we needed the test to confirm that. 
 Did we? 
 Antihistamines are the first line of treatment. 
 If it's still bothering you, I'd say talk to your primary care doctor. but there's nothing to worry about. 
 See? That's good news. 
 Thank you... for the great care. 
 Our pleasure. 
 Why didn't you say anything? 
 He wasn't lucky to have a heart attack here. 
 I gave it to him. 
 It is also my instinct to be truthful, and I am, most of the time. 
 So why not now? Because if we tell the truth, you'll be fired for whistleblowing, and another conscientious doctor will no longer be helping patients. 
 The lesson to learn is the best and hardest thing in medicine is often to do nothing. 
 We care for our patients knowing full well this is also a business. 
 The trick is not to get caught between the two. 
 My first day was also a disaster. 
 And by the end of it, I was questioning whether... 
 I worked way too hard to get here. 
 I have no intention of quitting. 
 Good. 
 No one died, no one quit. 
 My job here is done. 
 Oh, and you're not the only one to blame for Odel's bronchoscopy. 
 The new RVU system is, too. 
 Radical virus... 
 Relative value units. Oh. 
 That's why Dr. Langford was so quick to suggest it. 
 Right. 
 Well, today is the day we introduce 3B Life to the American public, and I'll be damned if you two handsome bastards aren't just perfect for the job. 
 Just, you know, stick to the teleprompter and gold we shall be. 
 As they say on the boards of Broadway, hatsloche un broche. 
 Break a leg. 
 3B Life, you're up in one minute. 
 We have Dr. Randolph Bell and Andrea Braydon... 
 Ready to make history? You bet. 
 Hey, how's the big first day? 
 Mm, practicing medicine is hard, but teaching it is a whole other beast. 
 That's the truth. 
 There's something else. I need to schedule some lab work. 
 Yeah? For who? Me. 
 What's wrong? 
 I've just got some pain under my ribs. 
 Stomach ache, and this rash. 
 And my fingers are... 
 Hmm, headache? Increased heart rate? 
 Yeah. 
 I think you have RAS. 
 Resident anxiety syndrome. 
 Conrad had it, too. 
 It's the anxiety of being a second-year resident responsible for others. 
 Can't say it ever goes away, but you do learn to live with it. 
 I hope you're right. I think I am. 
 Get some rest, Pravesh. 
 Forget about your interns till tomorrow. 
 Mm. 
 Yeah! 3B For Life, people. I mean, we rocked America. Well, Andrea took the lead, I just... I followed. Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, what happened? No, it was great, really. 
 We had a weight-loss story and a heroic tale. 
 Couldn't have planned it better. 
 Which is hardly a surprise, I'd say. 
 Hey, what's going on? 
 You know, Grayson told me about your day, so I said I had to come by and congratulate you in person. 
 Dr. Barrett Cain. Chief of Surgery. 
 Um... Yes, I know. I know, this is a hard act to follow, but I'm doing my best. 
 Andrea Braydon. 
 Would you, um, like s... Oh. 
 Looks like we're running a little low. 
 Well, we'll have to get some more. Oh, great. 
 Thank you very much. That's-that's what I'm talking about. 
 Uh, Dr. Bell. Word, please? 
 Well, cheers, guys. Amazing. 
 Mazel tov. Mazel tov. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, it's only a matter of time before the board realizes that you swiped an opportunity from underneath them. 
 You rejected Andrea's pitch to them so you could have the investment all to yourself. 
 That's hardly what happened. 
 And it's a high-risk investment, and one that Chastain would never make. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, that's not how I'm gonna spin it. 
 So what do you want? 
 I don't know. 
 A healthy percentage of our growing supplement business. 
 And in return I'll just smooth things over with the board. 
 Look, I have partners. 
 Right. It's hardly my decision to make. 
 Yes, and I'm sure they will be thrilled to add another prestigious physician with the product. 
 And if anybody can convince 'em, it's you. 
 Ain't that right, partner? 
 He's bringing it. Yeah. More bubbly.

 ♪ See how they run ♪ 
 The answer is yes, I have been dodging your calls. 
 I am well aware. 
 Guessing you heard I was fired. 
 You know, the truth is I figured it would happen one day. 
 You're a rule breaker. 
 I've decided I'm not gonna let them win so easily. 
 Son, I've gone toe-to-toe with a lot of titans in my time. 
 These Red Rock people... you're gonna have to bring more than a slingshot to this fight. 
 It's gonna get ugly. 
 For all of us. 
 I just want to make sure you know what we're up against. 
 I hear you, Dad. Thank you. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Missed you today. 
 I missed you, too. 
 It was a good day? 
 Zero-g with Finn is just what I needed. 
 Oh, yeah? Mm. 
 Red Rock came for me. 
 Now I'm coming for them.
