 Previously on The Resident... 
 I just signed with the hottest music agent in Atlanta. 
 You can't be a musician. 
 You're a princess. Your time here will be coming to an end. 
 Yo, Pravesh! Rupa is one of my goddaughters. 
 Her son has a very rare condition. 
 His heart is growing outside his body. 
 I worked hard all my life to be seen like my dad. 
 He was a good man. 
 We're getting hitched, baby! 
 Nicolette Nevin, will you do me the honor? 
 Yes. 
 Everything okay up there? 
 I just dropped something! 
 You could slow down. 
 If we don't hurry, we're not gonna get a table. 
 You're the one who wanted to shake things up. 
 Uh, I meant like skydiving or hiking Stone Mountain, but, hey, if this is what you want to do, I am all in. 
 Too much? 
 Wow! 
 Does it go with these? 
 Oh, my God! 
 That's so sweet. 
 I love them! 
 You're wearing the ring. 
 Aren't we still keeping that on the DL? 
 For now, yes. 
 We should let Jessica and Irving have their moment. 
 I was ready to shout it from the rooftops. 
 I like having our sweet little secret. 
 For now, anyway. 
 But today we celebrate our engagement. 
 We got to go. 
 ♪ Yeah, two doors down ♪ 
 ♪ They're laughing and drinking and having a party ♪ 
 ♪ And two doors down they're not aware that I'm around ♪ 
 ♪ But here I am crying my heart out... ♪ Okay. Right? 
 Okay. 
 This is fun. Oh, my God. 
 I told you it's packed! 
 This is the coolest thing I've ever seen. 
 We have to bring everyone we know. 
 Bell and Cain don't have the right pumps. 
 Ezra, what are you doing here? 
 I'm a regular. What? 
 Pro tip... the chicken and waffles are divine. 
 Skip the biscuits and gravy. 
 Good to know. Mm-hmm. 
 You got it. Uh-oh! 
 Who do we have here? 
 Oh, hello. 
 Me? Me? Yes, you, Mr. Handsome. 
 Hello. 
 I love this. I love... 
 I love this. 
 Thank you, thank you. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, guys? 
 My friends and I have a table up front if you want to come join us. Yes. 
 Yeah. Yeah? 
 Yeah. Wait until you see the headliner, Doll E. Wood. 
 She is a-mazing.

 The one and only, Doll E. Wood! 
 Oh, it's a glorious Sunday to be who you always wanted to be. 
 Boy, you sound like a partying crowd. 
 Do you like to party? Yeah! 
 Well, that's a good thing, 'cause I hear there's one happening two doors down, and we are all invited.

 What's going on? I don't know. 
 This wasn't in the act before. 
 Doll? Doll, are you okay? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Still breathing. 
 Pulse is weak. 
 Call 911, we need an ambulance. 
 Take her to Bay Seven. 
 Give me the bullet. 
 We were at this amazing drag brunch. 
 I start on surgery tomorrow, so I needed to decompress, you know? Bullet, Ezra, not life story. 
 This is Joseph Kinney, aka the amazing Doll E. Wood. 
 Ezra, want to take another shot at that bullet? 
 Acute onset abdominal pain with syncope. 
 Hypotension... One, two, three. 
 Hypotension improved with two liters normal saline en route. 
 Y'all are too kind, all y'all. 
 I'm so embarrassed, causing all this fuss. 
 No need to be embarrassed... this is what we do. 
 We want to help. 
 Let's get you into a gown, so we can do a full exam... Ezra? 
 You have pain like this before? 
 Off and on. 
 I just ignored it. 
 With all the acrobatics, the dancing, the cinching and the tucking. 
 I threw my back out. 
 I even had kidney stones. 
 I'm used to hurting. 
 Let's, uh, get an EKG as well as a CBC and a CMP to start. 
 Doll, we're just covering all the bases. 
 We're gonna take good care of you. Okay. 
 Dr. Feldman and I are gonna get you some pain meds right now. 
 Got your gown here. 
 Oh, a gown... Oh. 
 I don't know... white is really not my color. 
 I'm more of an autumn. 
 Would you be a doll and shut that curtain for me? 
 You got it. I don't need the world to see this show. 
 Tell Rupa and Salman that the baby is stable for now. 
 _ 
 _ 
 _ 
 Mm, she said she's scared. 
 She really wants to hold him. 
 Tell them that Baby Farhad has a combination of four heart abnormalities, known as Tetralogy of Fallot. 
 _ 
 _ 
 He's going to need two surgeries today. 
 The first to repair the defects, and the second is to put the heart back in the chest. 
 Two surgeries in one day on a newborn? 
 There's only been a handful of successful surgeries worldwide. 
 We're going to do everything we can to save Farhad. 
 Where are we with the prostaglandins? 
 They're maxed out. 
 Well, it's not working. 
 I did an echo ten minutes ago. 
 His ductus arteriosus has gotten smaller. 
 This baby needs surgery in the next few hours. 
 So, it has to happen at Chastain. 
 All you. 
 This is way beyond even my exceptional abilities. 
 This surgery has maybe a five percent success rate. 
 No, it's got to be done by a pediatric cardiac surgeon, who has experience in this procedure. 
 They want to take Baby Farhad to Boston Children's immediately. 
 He won't survive the transport, Nadine. 
 But we are not fully prepared here. 
 Now, Atlanta General has a dedicated pediatric cardiac center and doctors who are trained in this particular procedure. He's too unstable for transfer, even there. I know, I know. 
 Torres. 
 You worked at Atlanta General, right? 
 Yeah. Is there a world-class pediatric cardiac surgeon we could call in? 
 I know just the person. 
 Dr. Judith Brown. 
 Call her. 
 You got it. 
 Hey there, pretty lady. Look, I know everybody's real busy, but would y'all mind taking a look at my fiancée? 
 We've been here for a long time; she's in a lot of pain. 
 Technically, it's my day off. 
 I have an incoming trauma, could... you? 
 Sure. Thanks. 
 I'll take a look. Thank you. 
 You're the best. 
 Yvette, hi. I'm Nic. 
 I'm a nurse practitioner here. 
 Um, it says here you're 23 years old. 
 Is that true? Mm-hmm. 
 And, uh, and you're experiencing some stomach pain. 
 When did that start? Just today. 
 It wasn't too bad before. 
 On a scale from one to ten, how would you rate your pain? 
 It's pretty bad... I'd say a ten. 
 I'm gonna... 
 I'm gonna need Yvette to answer. 
 It really hurts. 
 I don't know, maybe... maybe a ten. 
 Do you have any other symptoms? 
 A little bleeding. 
 Down there. 
 You didn't... tell me that. 
 All right, I'm gonna have to do a pelvic exam. 
 Do you mind stepping out? Oh, uh... 
 I'll stay. 
 I'd like him to stay. 
 There you go. 
 I can't leave Rupa and Salman alone for too long. 
 I know, the NICU will let us know when they need you back. 
 How are you doing? You must be exhausted. 
 It was a long night. 
 Well, a trip to the hospital is not the best way to end a birthday party, and in the middle of all of this, you have a big decision to make. 
 Devon? 
 My father wants me to... leave Atlanta and return home tomorrow. 
 He's not just my father, he's... my king. 
 There is no decision to be made. 
 Well... is this what you want? 
 It doesn't matter what I want. 
 I can't put my own wishes before my obligation to my people. 
 And with everything that Rupa and Salman are facing, it seems selfish to even think about it right now. 
 Wow. 
 So... this is our last day together. 
 I guess it is. 
 Dr. Brown is here. 
 How long did you two work together at Atlanta General? 
 Throughout fellowship. 
 She's excellent... she's mastered techniques used for operating on neonatal hearts. 
 And since we worked together, she's asked me to assist. 
 His murmur has gotten softer in the last hour. 
 He's also gotten more cyanotic. 
 Dr. Brown's gonna have to create a shunt surgically. 
 I know we tolerate lower O2 sats in infants, but his have dropped into the 50s. 
 He's not getting enough oxygen in his blood. 
 This baby needs surgery now. 
 Pravesh, you seen Dr. Brown? 
 She's not answering her page. No. 
 I thought she was with you. 
 Rupa and Salman want to meet her. Maybe later. 
 We need to find her and have her scrub in immediately. 
 Looking for Dr. Brown? 
 She's in the lab. 
 I'll get her. 
 You guys prep Farhad for the OR. 
 Take Salman and Rupa back to L&D. 
 Dr. Brown? Mm, yes? 
 You're needed in OR Two immediately. 
 Feel a bit of a cold coming on. 
 This isn't a day to call in sick, so I am just giving myself some hydration and O2. 
 You can tell 'em I'll be right there. 
 You doctors are miracle workers. Ah, all we did was run some tests and give you fluids and pain meds. 
 The real miracle is how you somehow managed to grab your makeup bag and bring it in the ambulance. 
 Well, when a girl feels her worst, that's when she must look her best. 
 Spoken like a true icon. 
 Indeed. So I'm free to leave? 
 No, not yet. 
 We need to figure out why your calcium is so high, and then treat it. Want to explain further? 
 Hypercalcemia could be causing all your symptoms. 
 Belly pain, weak muscles, even kidney stones. High calcium. 
 My uncle and my daddy both had that. 
 Did their doctors know why? No. 
 They both got pancreatic cancer. 
 Passed away when I was in high school. 
 Excuse me. 
 I heard that Dolly Parton had collapsed onstage, and I just thought... 
 The next best thing is right here, honey. 
 She's the person I always wanted to be. 
 You know what Dolly always said. 
 "Don't rent it, don't lease it, own it". 
 I'm... sorry for intruding. 
 I see you're in very good hands, so... 
 Hold on, handsome. 
 I will serenade you with Dolly's hit, "Kiss It And Make It All Better". 
 Um... maybe later. 
 We're gonna order some more tests, and we'll be right back. Okay. 
 Dr. Bell, a moment, please? 
 I need to do genetic tests and scans, but I suspect Joseph may have MEN 1. 
 Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia. 
 Would that explain his family history of high levels of calcium and pancreatic tumors? 
 Yes. If he has MEN 1, he could have a tumor in any of his endocrine glands. 
 I'm thinking parathyroids. 
 Which is where you would come in, because... if I'm right, he would need surgery. Yeah, okay. 
 Let me know what you find. 
 All right, go ahead and put in the orders. 
 Hey. 
 Everything okay? 
 See the couple in Bay Four? 
 She has pelvic inflammatory disease from gonorrhea. 
 Says she's 23, but I'm not even sure she's 18. 
 We've been here all day. 
 And he hovers. 
 Doesn't leave her side for a second. 
 He says they're from out of town, but she's already been in our ER for an STD a few months ago. 
 Listen to me. Listen... Just stop. 
 You think she's being trafficked. 
 I need your help getting her alone so that I can find out if she's safe. 
 Okay. 
 Yvette, Marcus, this is Dr. Hawkins. 
 I brought him in to consult. He also agrees that a round of antibiotics should clear your symptoms. 
 Great. We'll swing by the pharmacy on our way out. 
 Call in a prescription? Nic did. 
 But before you go, I'll need to give you an exam. 
 Can't you just write me a prescription, too? 
 Not without an examination. 
 Nic, why don't you take Yvette to the pharmacy while I give Marcus... 
 No, no, no, you ain't treating me, okay? 
 You're treating her, and we're taking off. Let's go. 
 But before you do any of that, there's something else I wanted to take a look at. 
 Do you mind if Dr. Hawkins listens to your heart? 
 I heard a little abnormality when I was listening to it earlier. 
 This'll just take a second. 
 Yeah, I hear it, too. She could have endocarditis. 
 It's a life-threatening condition and result of her STD. 
 And can cause sudden death. 
 Bacteria travels through the bloodstream and enters into your heart. We absolutely have to do a cardiac ultrasound. No. 
 Doctors make up stuff all the time to get more tests. 
 Come on, Yvette, let's go. Endocarditis is very real, I promise you. We can do the echo right now. 
 If it's negative, you go on your way. 
 I just... know you want Yvette to be safe. 
 I'll do it. 
 I don't want to die. 
 Then we'll go right now. Thank you. 
 How long is this gonna take? 
 It won't take long at all. We'll just be right back. 
 I'm going with her. 
 Only patients are allowed in the echo suite. 
 Sorry about that. It's just hospital rules, not mine. 
 Dr. Brown, we are ready for the Blalock-Taussig shunt. Great. 
 Let's have that graft on hand. 
 Time to dissect out the... uh... uh... 
 The pulmonary artery? 
 Cautery, please. 
 Is it me, or is she a little off? 
 This is not the surgical star Torres led us to expect. 
 I saw her hooked to IVs earlier, giving herself supplemental oxygen. 
 She said she had a cold. 
 Laps. 
 Suction. Clamps to Dr. Brown. 
 She just lacerated the pulmonary artery. 
 Dr. Brown. 
 Judith! She's definitely swaying. 
 Dude, she may be intoxicated. 
 Dr. Brown, I'm tagging you out. 
 No, you aren't. This is under control. You are impaired. 
 Torres, talk to me. He's exsanguinating. 
 I need help stopping the bleeding. I will stop the bleed. 
 You've only made it worse. His artery is turning further. 
 My patient, my surgery. 
 You are not fit to operate. 
 Clamps to me... now. 
 Everything okay? Yeah, we stabilized the baby. 
 You commandeered my surgery. 
 Never, in all of my years of operating, have I had something so out... so outrageous happen. 
 You should be stripped of your privileges. 
 You tore this baby's pulmonary artery. 
 You been drinking? 
 That was a typical perioperative complication. 
 Then submit to a blood test. Absolutely not. 
 You can't refuse, Dr. Brown. It's in every surgeon's contract at Chastain. If you say no, we will alert the hospital admin and medical board that you refused. 
 What are you hiding, Dr. Brown? 
 Nothing. 
 Then prove it. Do the blood draw. 
 Right here, right now, so everybody can see it. 
 So Conrad's hypothesis was correct. 
 This is likely MEN 1-related abnormal growth of Doll E.'s... or should I say Joseph's parathyroids. 
 That's why his calcium is so high. 
 Yeah, it looks like four-gland hyperplasia causing the elevated calcium, so they'll need to be removed. 
 This is a delicate surgery just to avoid the critical nerves in that region. Correct me if I'm wrong, but damaging those nerves could destroy Joseph's voice. 
 Yes. But I'll do everything possible to make sure that doesn't happen. 
 And we'll monitor nerve function throughout the case. 
 "We"? So I can assist? 
 I start on surgery tomorrow. 
 I've been practicing my two-handed ties. It was more of a... it was a royal "we". 
 Oh. 
 But sure, you can scrub in. 
 My very existence as Doll E. Wood depends on my voice. 
 Well, you could still lip-synch. 
 Of course, but that's not all that's involved. 
 Dolly Parton talks, a lot. 
 She has an intimate rapport with her audience. 
 Doll E. Wood has to have a voice. 
 She must talk to her audience. She must. 
 Keeping your abnormal parathyroids in place could cause a hypercalcemic crisis. 
 That's what happened today. 
 Next time you could die. 
 You said "could" cause a fatal "hyperhoozamajiggy" crisis. 
 So it's not certain. No. 
 But it's a risk that you shouldn't take. 
 When I found my inner Doll, my whole life went from black and white to all the colors of the rainbow. 
 "If-if you want the rainbow, you got to put up with the rain. 
 Storms make trees take deeper roots". 
 Oh, this boy's a gem. He's quoting Dolly. 
 "If you don't like the road you're walking, start paving another one. 
 We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails". 
 Okay, I-I think we get the gist. 
 Everything possible to preserve your voice. 
 Shall we schedule the surgery? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 What about the ultrasound? 
 You don't actually need it. 
 There's nothing wrong with your heart. 
 We just wanted to have a private conversation with you. 
 What did I do? 
 Oh, nothing. You didn't... you didn't do anything. 
 You tricked me. 
 Marcus was right. I can't trust you. 
 You know, sometimes, um, in the hospital, we see people who we think might be in a situation that isn't safe. 
 So, um... we just wanted to make sure that you're not one of them. 
 I'm fine. 
 Marcus is my fiancé. We're in love and we're getting married. 
 I want to go now. 
 Look, Marcus doesn't need to know about any of this. 
 It's your choice. I mean, we're not gonna force you to do or say anything. We just... 
 We want you to know that you can. 
 Yvette? 
 You're safe, okay? 
 You're totally in control here. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. We understand now. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 You're safe. You're safe. We're here for you. 
 They're all coming out to see you, Doll. Oh, stop it. 
 I wish you'd reconsider. 
 You're a dear. 
 But I will take whatever time I have left as the full and complete Doll E. 
 If I die young like my daddy, well, so be it. 
 Can I have... just have a minute? 
 You know, my dad raised me on the Queen of Country. 
 Get out. Yeah. 
 My daddy took me straight to Dollywood the minute I could hold up my head. 
 I was practically baptized there. 
 So, were the two of you close? 
 We were. 
 My daddy was a pastor. 
 I was supposed to be next in line, till he realized what was what. 
 He knew I wasn't the son he expected. 
 I believe that broke his heart. 
 He talked for a while about conversion therapy, but he saw how I felt about that and he gave it up. 
 When I was bullied or attacked, he was the first one in line to defend me. 
 'Cause he was a good man, a loving man, who walked the walk of a Christian. 
 Judge not lest ye be judged. 
 He gave me the best gift of all. 
 Acceptance. 
 You know, I'm thinking that maybe you're a lot like him. 
 Too much, as it turns out. 
 Well... if your dad could have had the surgery, and it cost him his voice, so he couldn't preach, but you still had your dad, would that have been better than... 
 I see where you're headed. Very clever. 
 You don't have to share the same fate as your father. 
 We found this in time to save you. 
 And you may wake up with your voice intact. 
 There's a decent chance. 
 But if not... 
 "I can see the light of a clear blue morning..." 
 "I can see the light of a brand-new day". 
 You know. 
 "Everything's gonna be okay". 
 Oh... 
 You better give me some sugar. 
 So we'll schedule the surgery? 
 Okay. 
 How did you meet Marcus? 
 I was 16 and fighting with my mom a lot. 
 So I started to text with a man named Luis that I met on an app. 
 He told me that he'd help me run away. 
 And after a while, I began to like that idea. 
 So, one day I climbed out my bedroom window. 
 He had a car waiting. 
 There was another man in the car. 
 They blindfolded me and they drove away. 
 They drove for a long time. 
 Most likely across state lines. 
 Uh, they took me to a motel. 
 Marcus was there. 
 He said he had a client waiting for me. 
 I had no idea what he meant, but... 
 But then he took me to a motel room and he left me with that man and he did what he wanted to me. 
 My old life ended right there. 
 After that, Marcus said that I was now ruined, and that I belonged to him. 
 I could never go home again. 
 He said that no one would ever love me except him. 
 You know that none of that is true, right? 
 And you are not ruined. 
 And you're safe now. You don't have to do that anymore. 
 I hate it. 
 
 
 
 I hate all of it, but he said that he'd kill me. 
 He'd kill my whole family if I ever told anyone. 
 We're gonna make sure that doesn't happen. Nic? 
 We'll be back in two seconds, okay? 
 Okay. 
 I've notified social services. 
 They'll take over, find her a safe place to stay. 
 I'll go check on him. 
 I'll stay with her. 
 Where the hell is she? 
 It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. 
 It's okay, we're safe. They've got him. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 My work is my life. 
 I've performed the most complex surgeries. 
 The Norwood, the Glenn, the Bentall. 
 Sometimes back-to-back. 
 Patients came from all over the world. 
 Dr. Brown, you have an alcohol problem. 
 You almost killed a baby today. 
 That baby still needs surgery. 
 He needs it right now, and fortunately, I am the only one capable of doing it, so let's just go back to the OR... We are taking Baby Farhad back to the OR, but Torres and I will operate. 
 No, I can do it. No, you cannot. 
 That's not because I'm drunk. I'm in withdrawal. 
 Just get me a drink. 
 I'll be ready to go. 
 We'll treat you with benzos and you can guide us. 
 But you are not cutting. That is final. 
 With benzos, I would be too drowsy to guide you. 
 Without a drink, my symptoms will only escalate. 
 You've seen what happens. These shakes will get worse, I'll vomit, maybe hallucinate. 
 Even seize... I know what you're thinking. 
 You're thinking that I'm just an addict making up a line to get her fix, but you also know that what I'm saying is medically accurate. 
 The fact is, unless you let me drink, I will not be able to help you with the surgery. 
 We got to get her a drink. 
 No way. There is no other option, Pravesh. 
 Can you count backwards from ten? 
 I'd rather sing, since it might be for the last time. 
 ♪ It's been a long, dark night ♪ 
 ♪ And I've been waitin' for the morning ♪ 
 ♪ It's been a long, hard fight ♪ 
 ♪ But I see a brand-new day ♪ 
 ♪ A dawning ♪ 
 ♪ And I can't s... ♪ 
 Okay. 
 Time to scrub in. 
 One more shot. 
 Last one, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Ready. 
 All right. Let's make it happen. 
 Baby Farhad's parents want updates. 
 Are you gonna tell them about Dr. Brown? 
 We usually don't if there are no adverse outcomes to the patient. 
 This is unacceptable. 
 You know my dad would never approve of this. 
 How can giving Dr. Brown a drink be okay? 
 It's not right. 
 And I know that alcohol is considered haram, and forbidden. 
 But we've exhausted all options. 
 This is the only possible solution. 
 Farhad needs surgery, and he needs it now. 
 What if she gets drunk? 
 She knows how much to drink to function and not get drunk. 
 I promise you, she will never touch Farhad again. 
 Let's start by freeing the skin from the heart by tracing along the transition zone. 
 Scalpel to me. 
 Retractors to Torres. 
 All right, be careful not to pinch the P.A. 
 Chest is open. Let's rotate the heart in. 
 Hmm, it won't fit. 
 The heart is too big. 
 What if we take down the diaphragm? 
 Still not enough space. 
 You have to do a partial lung resection. 
 Removing the right lower lobe should give us enough room. 
 That would compromise his lung function. 
 He could end up in respiratory failure. 
 Well, partial lung resection is our only option. 
 We have to take the risk. 
 This is the first parathyroid. 
 Normally the size of a grain of rice, and here, it is enlarged. 
 And right next to it is the recurrent laryngeal nerve. 
 Incredible. This morning I heard him perform, and now I see what lets him sing. 
 So we are gonna save half this parathyroid. 
 And reimplant it into his arm. 
 That way he has enough remaining gland function so his calcium doesn't plummet. 
 You came prepared. 
 Would you like to assist me in removing the next one? 
 I have to admit, I am a bit nervous. 
 We're working so close to the nerve. 
 Well, he has very challenging anatomy, but if we're careful... 
 We lost the nerve signal. 
 What the hell did you do? Nothing. I didn't touch anything. 
 Give me that. Steady. 
 The nerve may have been damaged. 
 Dr. Bell, if he loses his voice... 
 Stop talking. 
 Where's Marcus? 
 He's been arrested, Yvette. 
 We don't want him to hurt other women. 
 You'll be safe, where you're going. 
 They have plenty of resources. 
 They'll take care of you. 
 For a while. 
 Then what? 
 I never finished high school. I have no way to make a living. 
 I can't undo the mistakes I've made. 
 You were a child, and you are blameless for what happened to you. 
 Go take your life back. 
 It's not gonna be easy, but I promise you can do it. 
 I've been in and out of hospitals a bunch of times. 
 And no one has ever taken the time to try and help me. 
 So thank you. 
 Come here. 
 You let us know if you need anything, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 Partial lung resection complete. 
 Now place the heart into his chest. 
 Ah... the heart is back in. 
 Let's align the breast bone and chest wall, then close. 
 Sutures and wires to me, por favor. 
 I'm impressed. 
 You should consider adding pediatric cardiac surgery to your triple board rolodex. 
 I'm grateful for your help, Dr. Brown. 
 But surgeon to surgeon, I really hope you seek help yourself. 
 I don't have to tell you that alcoholism is a disease. 
 But there are treatment programs for doctors. 
 I know our system looks away. 
 We live in a culture that discourages asking for help or speaking up. 
 It makes it very easy to self-destruct. 
 But you have a gift. 
 And you have patients who need you. 
 Let's bring the chest wall together. 
 BP is 40/20. 
 Heart rate is 200. He's about to code! 
 Max out pressors. 
 His heart is too fragile. No, he's too swollen. 
 She's right. 
 Closing the chest is constricting the heart, preventing it from pumping effectively. 
 We need to keep the chest open. 
 Cutters. 
 Oh, this is too horrible. 
 They'll try to close his chest later. 
 But if they can't... 
 All right, the swelling's gone down. 
 It's time to close his chest. 
 Back to the OR? 
 No. 
 We're gonna do it right here. 
 Bringing the chest wall and sternum together. 
 Pressure and heart rate are stable. 
 Heart is pumping effectively. 
 He'll need more surgeries in the future to reconstruct his chest, but at least for now, he has a chance to thrive. 
 One last thing... 
 Little man needs his armor. 
 Hey. 
 Just got off the phone with my dad. 
 He's really happy to hear Farhad's doing so well. 
 Yeah, he beat the odds. 
 Chastain came through. And we got lucky. 
 There's more, Devon. 
 My dad said if you wanted to continue seeing me, you could come be a doctor in my country. 
 He would get you a great spot in our finest hospital. 
 Wow. 
 That's lovely. 
 But this is my home. 
 Please, just think about it. 
 The offer stands. 
 Things don't have to end between us. 
 When's your flight home? 
 Tomorrow morning. 
 You done with your shift? Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 Good. 
 Not here. 
 Red gurney to surgical waiting area... 
 Joseph. 
 Good to see you awake. 
 Surgery went well. Your calcium levels are stable. 
 Can we hear your voice? That's premature. 
 It'll take him a little while to recover. 
 It's okay, I... 
 It... it doesn't sound good. 
 Well, that is to be expected. 
 You're going to be hoarse after being intubated. 
 It's normal. 
 It'll get better. Soon. 
 Will it be like before? 
 I hope so. 
 Thank you both. 
 It's in God's hands. 
 What are we doing next Sunday? 
 Let's go back to brunch. 
 We did not get the full experience, not by a long shot. 
 I can't believe that was this morning. 
 Ah, just another day at the office. 
 So... Hmm. 
 So we're gonna start telling everyone we're engaged, huh? 
 Let's shout it from the rooftops. 
 Oh, and in the spirit of being open, I have a confession. 
 I, um, may or may not have eaten the chocolates that you hid in your sock drawer. 
 You didn't. I did. 
 Aw... 
 Well, I have nothing to confess. Oh, really? Nothing? 
 Fine. 
 That diamond on your ring is fake. It's cubic zirconium. 
 Really? Yes. 
 Huh, it looks so real. 
 Well, in that case, you want it back? 
 Wait... I mean, if it's fake... 
 What? We don't have to get married. 
 Honestly. No. No, no, no, no, no. 
 I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. 
 I love it. 
 This isn't over. 
 I know.
