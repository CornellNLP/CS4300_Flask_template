 Scrub in with The Resident. 
 We need to lock the ER down now! 
 See all-new episodes Tuesdays. 
 And check out our other Fox programs-- 
 Almost Family, 9-1-1 and Prodigal Son. 
 Let's solve a murder. 
 Only on Fox. 
 Previously on The Resident... Lamar is his biological father. 
 Your mother is better than me in every way. 
 My hope is that you'll reach out to her. 
 You crossed lines that I would never cross. 
 Talking about the hostage? 
 I'm talking about the patient that you tortured to get the information that you needed. 
 I'm pregnant. But Adaku's getting great care and she's done everything right. 
 Pregnancy hormones might bring her cancer back. 
 Jessie died of a pulmonary embolism. Five other dialysis patients died at Chastain. 
 I think whatever killed your sister-- it killed them, too. 
 If you want to make a call, you got to pick up the phone and hit the buttons. 
 I don't know if I should call. 
 Head injury in one is a pilot. Just flew in from New York. 
 Took a tumble down the escalator, so they brought him right in. 
 His blood alcohol was.06. 
 Which means he was drunk while flying the plane. 
 And according to his liver enzymes, this is not his first time. 
 He's a chronic drinker. 
 No question. So you're thinking about whether you should report him to the FAA. 
 But in order to make that call, have to reveal his medical information, which violates HIPAA. Exactly. 
 Patients need to know that they can come to us for help without getting in trouble. This guy is a safety risk to others. 
 HIPAA rules won't matter to the people he kills if he's in the cockpit. 
 Make the call. 
 Bandage can come off tomorrow. 
 Okay. So, uh, am I good to get out of here? 
 Tell me, how often do you fly drunk? 
 So, what-- you gonna report me? 
 I thought about it. 
 But no. 
 There's an AA meeting around the corner. 
 I'm-I'm not a drunk. 
 Take it. 
 Yeah, I-I... 
 I don't think I have a problem. 
 I promise. Okay? 
 I'll-I'll read through it. 
 And I'll give it some... real thought. 
 Radiology transport needed in the ER. 
 Radiology transport needed in the ER. 
 Conrad, what's going on? 
 I couldn't sleep. I can't stop thinking about Jessie. 
 And all the dialysis patients that died because of these blood clots. 
 Well, have you found anything? 
 Oh, my God. You did. 
 I went over all the information we have, and there is a long... safety record for every medication they were on. 
 Except for one. 
 Hemopleatin. 
 These types of drugs can increase the risk of clots. 
 Does hemopleatin increase that risk more than others? 
 I don't know. 
 Conrad, could this have caused the P.E. that killed Jessie? 
 I don't know enough yet, but we need to talk to people who might. 
 I can't believe this all started with my dad. 
 He really believed there was more to Jessie's death. 
 I think he could've been right. 
 I already confirmed your afternoon pitches for the health supplement. 
 Then roll dat ass to Midtown, 'cause I just scored you theRain Man suite atel Cuatro Seasons. 
 I'm talking upgrades on upgrades, baby. 
 The views are gonna be pano-ram. 
 Good. I got you. 
 Question is, do you got a lady in the Big A or what? 
 Get out of my chair. 
 Thanks for your patience. We'll now begin boarding our first-class passengers for New York City. 
 Hi. How you doing? 
 Good, thank you. 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 We're not boarding your zone yet. 
 You just called first class. 
 Yes, and you are in coach. 
 I don't fly coach. Just scan it again. 
 Yeah, no, see? Right here, it says "Zone 5." 
 Uh, you know, um... my assistant probably... 
 Sir, we have a full flight today. 
 If you could just step to the side so that our first-class passengers can continue boarding. 
 Thanks. We'll be with you in a second. 
 Hi, sir. 
 Here you go. Enjoy your flight. 
 You're welcome. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard Flight 1980, with service from Atlanta to New York. 
 We are currently third in line for takeoff and are expected to be in the air in approximately seven minutes' time. 
 Flying solo? 
 Mm. Me, too. 
 Ellen went up yesterday. 
 Her brother's got a cabin upstate. 
 It's a five-hour drive, but cheaper than a hotel. 
 Ellen's my wife. 
 -42 years. Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff. 
 You married? 
 No ring. Whoa. 
 Handsome guy like you must have some fun. 
 I know I'm not a lot to look at right now, but, let me tell you, when I was young, oh... 
 ...there were ladies. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Then I met Ellen. 
 Blind date. 
 Can you believe it? Yeah, mini golf. True story. 
 Our second date was Argentinian food. 
 Oh, boy. 
 Let me tell you, that did a number on my wallet and stomach. 
 Oh, boy, let me tell you... 
 Somebody help me! 
 Let me help! 
 Come on! 
 We have to get out. 
 Come on. 
 Yeah, I heard on the radio. 
 They say most passengers are okay, but the seriously injured are headed here, Atlanta General and Emory. 
 All right, I'll turn around. No, you will not. 
 We have plenty of trauma surgeons here. 
 And we both know you have other plans today. 
 Look, I know you're nervous, but you have to do this. 
 You decided. You're going. 
 I just have this feeling in the pit of my stomach that I'm about to do harm. 
 And I do not like to do harm. 
 Chastain will page you if they need you. 
 Go. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God! -34-year-old female with blunt head trauma and a large scalp lac. 
 GCS and vitals? GCS, 14. 
 BP, 108/60. Pulse, 92. 
 Okay, let's get her to CT. 
 Let's hear it! 
 76-year-old male with complaints of diffuse abdominal pain. 
 Still hypotensive after two liters normal saline. 
 Tell me exactly where it hurts. 
 All right, let's get him to 11, please. 
 60-year-old male with significant trauma... an unstable pelvis, open radial fracture. 
 Randolph, you were on the plane? 
 Yeah. I'm fine. 
 Him, not so much. 
 He's had 12 milligrams of morphine so far. 
 Let's hang two grams cephalexin. 
 Mild diffuse tenderness. 
 Postponed all my elective surgeries. 
 What do we have here? Well, he wasn't wearing his seat belt when the plane dropped. 
 He hit the ceiling hard and then fell to the floor. 
 How you doing? I'm Dr. Cain. 
 Can you wiggle your fingers and give me the okay sign? 
 Perfect. I can't feel distal pulses. I need the Doppler. How about thumbs-up-- can you do that? 
 Radial nerve injury. 
 I need to get him to the OR. He needs a pan-scan and angios of his extremities before he goes to the OR. 
 Ellen. 
 That's his wife. 
 Don't worry. 
 We'll get her here. Dr. B. 
 Dr. B, you're alive. I never pray, but when I saw the crash on the news, I prayed hard. - Okay. 
 Thank you, Grayson. Are you all right? 
 Yeah. I'm just a little stiff. We should get you checked out. 
 Or we can focus on the people here who are actually hurt. 
 Ms. Mitchka. 
 Dr. Hawkins. 
 Where's my phone? 
 Oh, sorry. I know-I know you don't allow these in here. 
 I saw the signs. I- I just... 
 I have to try to reschedule a meeting in New York and get there ASAP. You've had a pretty rough day. 
 I'll make an exception. 
 Any past medical problems? 
 Oh, just strangers waking me up in weird places, like car washes, drive-throughs. 
 But a hospital's a new one. 
 I can fall asleep anywhere, whether I want to or not. 
 Narcolepsy? 
 Since I was nine. 
 Sorry. 
 Sorry, I... This is so rude, I know. 
 I just... I have to e-mail my boss. 
 They don't give you the day off after being in a plane crash? 
 I just... I can't risk losing this job. 
 Most employers aren't so patient about the whole falling asleep thing. 
 What do you do? 
 I sell accounting software. 
 Yeah. 
 I don't love it, but I get to travel. 
 And on, uh... on planes, no one judges you for falling asleep, so-- oh-- that... so that's a perk. 
 Is that all right? Yeah. 
 Oh. 
 Your blood pressure's high. 
 Says here you're on three medications for it. 
 Sometimes I forget. 
 Honestly, it never seems to help anyway. 
 Are we done? High BP is a tricky one. 
 It's called the silent killer for a reason. 
 You don't feel the damage it's doing on a daily basis. 
 Okay. 
 So, before you go back to work, I'd like to keep you here, run some tests, get your BP under control. 
 I'll have someone come back and suture that up. 
 And I'll write your boss the best doctor's note you've ever seen. 
 How's the eye? 
 She'll be fine. 
 No foreign bodies. 
 Just a pterygium. 
 Pterygium. P- T-E-R-Y-G-I-U-M. 
 Nice. 
 Oh, come on. That was too easy. 
 They were headed to a spelling bee. 
 Ah. And Rufus here suffered quite the scare, but his tachycardia was resolved with a bit of juice. 
 Tachycardia. T- A-K... 
 C- H, not K. 
 Tachys from the Greek "tachys,"meaning "quick, rapid." 
 Cardia from the Latinized "kardia" meaning... "heart." Mm. 
 Dr. Hawkins won the Chatham County Spelling Bee when he was your age. Loves to bring it up. 
 Ah, it's the biggest bee in the Southeast. 
 I've never heard of it. 
 You're early. 
 I saw the news. 
 Time of death, 10:13. 
 You all right? 
 That pilot I treated last night-- he'd fly between New York and Atlanta for the same airline. 
 I thought I'd convinced him to get help. 
 You didn't report him? 
 You think he was flying this plane? 
 I could've stopped him. 
 It's a great drug. 
 So much so, we made hemopleatin the standard of care for anemic patients six months ago. 
 Any adverse side effects? None. 
 In fact, quite the opposite. Uh, six patients recently died of a P.E. 
 Would you say that hemopleatin patients are more likely to get blood clots? 
 My colleagues and I do weekly case conferences. 
 If a drug were killing our patients, we'd notice. How many patients are on it currently? Let's see. 
 Uh, some are on chemo. 
 Others have blood disorders or on dialysis. 
 I'd say 200. 
 We'd like to see their records. 
 For that you need to submit a request to the Institutional Review Board. 
 The IRB takes weeks. 
 Months, with Red Rock in charge. 
 Any way you can help us get it faster? 
 Hospitals don't like to share data. 
 Not even with their own staff. 
 Last year, I put in a request to find out the infection rates in my department. And how long did it take for you to hear back? I'm still waiting. 
 I swear, I'm not trying to be bossy. 
 I just want to help you with your birth plan. 
 That's why I'm here. 
 Let's do this. Okay. 
 Everyone, listen up. 
 You must be Adaku. 
 I hear you're quite the world traveler. 
 I prepped them. Of course you did. 
 This is from all of us. 
 This is incredible. 
 I'm gonna cry. 
 Does everyone get this treatment? 
 You're not everyone. 
 Just remember, I'm in charge. Of course. 
 And you have many choices to make today. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks, guys. 
 Okay, so where are we going now? 
 Okay, so this is where you're gonna have the baby. - Okay. 
 What did the fish say when he swam into the wall? 
 Dam! 
 Help your old man out, son. 
 Could have laughed just once. 
 I could, but it would be fake, Dad. 
 But in my heart, I would receive it as real. 
 Yee... look at him. 
 Something is not right. I know. 
 My kung pao shrimp has made grown men weep, and he hasn't touched a bite. 
 All right, come clean, son. Did you get a girl pregnant? 
 I found my birth parents. 
 How? The records were closed. 
 They didn't tell us anything about who they were. 
 If we'd have known, we would've told you. I know. 
 But they came looking for me. 
 At least, my biological father did. 
 Dude just showed up at the hospital. 
 Tell us everything. What was he like? 
 No sense of humor, like you? 
 Well, he's stubborn. 
 He's melodramatic, and he's opinionated. 
 So, no, he's nothing like me. 
 Hey. Any word on the pilot? 
 NTSB isn't releasing any names. 
 We don't know for sure your patient crashed the plane. 
 Same airline, same route. 
 Too much of a coincidence. 
 Hey, you didn't crash the plane. 
 If he did cause this, it's on him. 
 One man is dead. Maybe more. 
 Every doctor has a patient in their past they want to go back to and treat in a different way. 
 Focus on the ones who need you right now. 
 So I took him into surgery. 
 You operated on your birth father? 
 I saved the dude's life. 
 Ah. 
 That must've really impressed the man. 
 He must really want to get to know you now. 
 Well, that's not gonna happen. 
 But what about your birth mother? 
 I didn't meet her. 
 And I don't plan to. 
 Look, you are the only parents that I know. 
 Everything that I am, everything that I've accomplished, I owe to both of you. 
 Ah. 
 Here we go. 
 "I cannot help you, for I am just a cookie"? 
 Oh, th-this you laugh at. 
 It's true. 
 This is not even a fortune. 
 Well, take it up with the owner. 
 Oh, I will. Mm. 
 You okay, Ma? 
 I'm okay. 
 Grayson, do you believe in fate? 
 I do believe I was born to do this job, sir. 
 Passengers at the front of the plane didn't fare so well when it crashed. 
 Had I been seated in first class instead of coach, I might've been hurt. 
 It's because of your mistake that I was able to help people to safety. 
 People are saying you're the Sully of Atlanta. 
 Now, we both got lucky. 
 Because if you ever seat me in coach again, you're fired. 
 This poor guy was seated next to me. I've called his wife, but she's not here yet. 
 Cervical spinal damage and nerve injury. 
 Yeah. We got to stop the bleeding first. 
 By stabilizing the bones? 
 Yeah, and removing the spleen. The nerve repair can wait. 
 It can, if you want him to lose all neurological function. 
 Look at these injuries. 
 He's far too unstable to fix everything. Well, yeah. 
 So we prioritize. 
 You good? 
 Yeah. You should start on the nerves that are most at risk, and then I'll control the hemorrhage from his spleen. 
 I'll stabilize the pelvic fractures and ex fix arms and legs. 
 Yeah. We'll just get him back to the ICU until he's stable enough for another go. 
 Oh! 
 Randolph! 
 Are you all right? 
 No. 
 I think filling out that IRB application gave me carpal tunnel. 
 Red Rock hopes people tire out. 
 Well, it's in, so now we wait. 
 Patients are on hemopleatin right now. 
 One click is all it takes to cut through the red tape. 
 If I break the glass, we get immediate access to the records of any patient on the drug. 
 Conrad, if you break the glass, your name is recorded on those charts permanently. 
 You could be fired for accessing medical records for patients that aren't yours. 
 If anyone notices. 
 Well, maybe they don't now, but someday. 
 Do you really want that hanging over you the rest of your career? 
 And if we can't get the answersany other way? 
 Then I'll break it. 
 I won't let you. Well, I won't let you. 
 But we're not there yet. Come on, let's explore all of our other options first. 
 All right. 
 Come on. 
 Yeah. I knew we'd feel something. 
 Here? No. No. 
 What about here? Yeah. Yep. Felt it. 
 Left paralumbar tenderness right there. 
 You're seeing what I'm seeing. 
 Yeah, I wish I wasn't. 
 Care to share? You have a herniated disc. 
 A disc is bulging out from... 
 Yeah. No. I know what a herniated disc is. 
 It may be pressuring the L5 nerve root, and causing nerve impingement and radicular symptoms. 
 We can give you some anti-inflammatories to help get you through the day. 
 And something stronger if you need it. 
 I think our next step is clear. 
 You need physical therapy. I'll perform a discectomy. 
 Surgery? You're not serious. 
 With a discectomy and fusion, you have a better chance at a quick recovery. 
 And you can avoid nerve injury. 
 Head-to-head trials show that spinal fusion surgery has a success rate of barely 35%. 
 Even successful patients often end up on pain killers for years. Well, those stats are national averages. 
 I'm above average. In fact, my success rate is phenomenal. 
 That's an easy claim to make when most hospitals aren't required to publish their surgical outcomes. 
 Okay, well, talk to my patients. 
 You can find them on golf courses, running marathons, not popping pills. 
 Surgery seems aggressive. 
 After all, the injury was only today. 
 I have no perceptible nerve... perceptible nerve damage. Yeah, well, even without the nerve damage, PT takes a long time. 
 We're talking no sailing, no golfing... no s*x. 
 Yeah, and how long? 
 What do you want to do, Randolph? 
 So... do you want music for the labor? 
 I want to start off with some Lizzo. 
 Mm-hmm. - Talking Heads for the big finish. 
 I like it. 
 What about, um... birthing positions? 
 We can have an exercise ball, a sling or a birthing stool. 
 Yes. Oh, we'll have all three on the day. 
 You're doing great so far. You know, there's, um... there's another decision I already gave a lot of thought to. 
 Mina Okafor, I want you to be my baby's godmother. 
 Godmother? I'm cancer-free now, but we both know that that could change. 
 If anything happens to me, I want my baby to have a strong, brilliant Nigerian woman to show them the way. 
 Okay, how can I help? 
 Leave. 
 Your blood work shows your kidneys are severely damaged. 
 And with your abnormal EKG, we're seeing signs of cardiac injury. 
 All from the crash? 
 Your kidney damage is from years of untreated high blood pressure, but the stress of the crash raised your blood pressure even more, and now... you are at risk for further organ damage. 
 It's a hypertensive emergency, Susan. 
 We need to transfer you to the ICU. 
 The ICU? For how long? 
 We'll know more in a couple days. 
 But we need to get your blood pressure under control. 
 No. I have to get back to work.I have lived with high blood pressure my entire adult life. 
 This is... This is much more complicated than just high blood pressure. 
 We need to prevent irreversible damage to your organs. 
 So what? 
 I'm sleeping my life away anyway. 
 And there is no cure. 
 You can't change that. 
 My life is what it is. 
 So... I might as well at least make sure that I don't lose my job. 
 Excuse me. 
 Susan. 
 I don't think you understand. 
 If you leave, you could die. 
 Now do we understand each other? 
 Call security. We can't let Susan Mitchka in bay three leave. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm putting Susan on a medical hold. 
 I think she has hypertensive encephalopathy, and she lacks the capacity to make decisions. 
 Hang on a minute. 
 She can make decisions just fine. 
 She's not in the right state of mind. 
 This isn't about her. 
 It's about the pilot. 
 This is not the same thing. 
 His drinking put other people in danger. 
 She needs treatment. Yes. 
 But the decision only affects her. 
 She wants to leave against medical advice, it's her choice, not ours. 
 Prepare her paperwork. Yes, Doctor. 
 I'm signing myself out against medical advice. 
 This is all very dramatic. 
 After we get your BP sorted out, we can try to get your narcolepsy under control. You don't get it. 
 I've seen every specialist. 
 I've tried every medicine. 
 Nothing works for me. 
 So save your effort for someone you can actually help. 
 You seeing what I'm seeing? 
 You don't think it could be? 
 Only one way to find out. 
 Hey, Susan. 
 Anyone ever tell you you walk kind of funny? 
 Insult patients who leave. What kind of hospital is this? 
 Your CT was normal, but I think all your doctors missed something. 
 I'd like to do an MRI of your brain before you go. 
 You're kidding. Hey, I get it. 
 You don't think things will ever change. 
 You've spent your whole life just trying to get by. 
 I can't. 
 I can't hope anymore. 
 I am fresh out. 
 We're not. 
 I think we can help you, but you got to trust us. 
 We just need two minutes. I don't have two seconds. 
 We've got a female patient, 30s, diagnosed with narcolepsy as a teenager. 
 Hypertensive emergency we thought was due to med-noncompliance and the crash. 
 She has a wide, staggering gait indicative of cerebellar ataxia. 
 Because she doesn't actually have narcolepsy. 
 She was misdiagnosed. What she really has is central sleep apnea, caused by a Chiari malformation. 
 She needs you to operate. 
 I'm booked five weeks out. 
 She's got gold-plated insurance. 
 Okay, I get it. 
 
 
 
 So you guys think I'm some Red Rock tool who only cares about the money. 
 I could have gone to any hospital in the country, gentlemen. 
 I chose Chastain because I saw the opportunity to help as many people as possible, with a staff who would support me, or at least stay out of my way. 
 Coming at me like this is not how it's done. 
 Your patient needs my help, I will operate on her because I care, not because she can pay. 
 Maybe we misjudged him. 
 Check her insurance. 
 I'm a surgical resident, which means I work 80 hours a week, but it's more like 120 with all the studying and prep. 
 I arrive by 4:30 a.m., leave no earlier than 7:00. 
 I'm on call every three days. 
 Work Saturday or Sunday or both. 
 And I have two more years left of residency, followed by at least another few years of fellowship, during which my schedule will only get worse. 
 Uh... Do you know what the salary for a surgical resident is? 
 Ah, there's more. Yes. 
 $55,000 a year. 
 Even if I had time, I can't afford childcare. 
 Is that all? 
 And I only like children that belong to other people. 
 Okay, so... what you're saying is, you... don't want to be my baby's godmother. 
 I'm saying I'm the wrong choice. 
 I will hold your hand at ultrasounds, shop for baby clothes, be with you every step of the way. 
 Unless I die. - I will do everything in my power to make sure you don't. 
 Got it. 
 So I have four choices for pain relief, two for fetal monitoring. 
 I can choose between membrane stripping or Pitocin or artificial rupture. 
 But who will take care of my baby if I'm gone? 
 That choice I do not get to make. 
 I'll help you find someone else. 
 Adaku, I don't understand why this is so upsetting to you. 
 Because it's the only thing that we've talked about today that actually matters to me. 
 Pelvic fixation complete. 
 Rongeur. Rongeur. 
 I'll be quick. 
 I can insert the pins while I wait. 
 Drill. 
 Watch your alignment, Dr. Voss, or your radial shaft will be gapped. 
 Oh, thank goodness you're here. 
 Bleeding controlled. 
 Applying the abdominal vacuum so I can get him back up to the ICU. 
 I'm right behind you. 
 Starting the graft now. 
 Oh? Already? 
 Got someplace to be? Speed and performance can go hand in hand. 
 What do you drive? 
 Jerry is a person, not a car. 
 If I didn't move this fast, this person would lose all nerve function in his arm. 
 Jerry can't move his arms if he has no arms. 
 Get height restoration and page me if there's any surprises. 
 Wait, you're not leaving this man's nerve function to a third-year. 
 Of course. Hanna's extraordinary. 
 She may be, but that's not how we do things here. 
 Now, get back there and do your job. 
 Uh... his pelvis is filling with blood. 
 I thought we were about to close. No, the packing must have stretched the vessels. I also repaired a partial tear up here earlier. Corona mortis. 
 It's the crown of death. Bleeding from the connection between the obturator and iliac arteries. 
 It's usually fatal. Bovie. Lap. 
 Retractors to me. We need to control this now. Lap suction. 
 Lap. Lap. 
 You must be Jerry's wife. Yes. 
 I'm Dr. Bell. 
 During the surgery, your husbandhad significant bleeding. 
 Our surgeons managed to stop it, but his blood pressure dropped for a long time. 
 Is he okay? Well, he's being moved to the ICU now. 
 He's alive. 
 But, uh... we just don't know if he's gonna wake up. 
 What? 
 You know, actually, I was... 
 I was sitting beside your husband on the flight. 
 He wouldn't stop talking about you. 
 I hit "ignore." 
 He called me. 
 I was at the store and I hit "ignore." 
 Because once Jerry gets going... 
 I hit "ignore." 
 Well, I'll let you know as soon as you can see him. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. Hi. 
 How long before your next surgery? 
 About 20 minutes. Oh, good. 
 Come, please sit with me. 
 What's up? 
 You know, your dad always wanted to adopt a kid. 
 I took a little more convincing. 
 I was scared. 
 That's funny, I... 
 You? 
 I can't imagine you being scared of anything. 
 Yeah. I was worried that we wouldn't be enough, that we were being selfish. 
 Taking a child who might be better off with people who would give them everything they needed. 
 Okay, something tells me you didn't drive from Buckhead to tell me that. I came here to tell you that I don't think you're being honest with us or yourself. 
 Come on, Ma. No, you come on, AJ. 
 You are my son, and I know you. 
 And I also know that one day, you will want to meet your biological mother. 
 That woman is a stranger who threw me away. 
 I do not want to meet her. 
 Because you're scared. 
 That she won't be enough for you, or that you won't be enough for her. 
 And you're also scared that she might hurt you again. 
 Listen. 
 You won't know what you'll find when you walk through their door, but you will know exactly what you'll find when you walk back through ours. 
 No matter what, we will always be here for you. 
 So when you're ready... 
 ...you go see her, my son. 
 But I got a few ground rules. 
 Birthdays and holidays are mine. 
 You got it. 
 And every other day in between. 
 You got it. 
 How did it go with the parents? 
 Better than I could have imagined. 
 You know, my mother actually encouraged me to meet my biological mother. 
 Will you? 
 I don't know. 
 But now I know I can. 
 They're great people. 
 Mina, they are amazing people. 
 Even when they don't know what they're saying yes to, they still put me first, even if it hurts. 
 That's family. 
 The ones who sacrifice for you out of love. 
 Who make the difficult decisions. 
 Even if they have every reason to run away. 
 I hope I can be the kind of parent they are. 
 How'd it go with Adaku? 
 It didn't. 
 And now I think I understand why. 
 How's Susan? 
 Dr. Cain is retrieving the patch now. 
 She should be okay. 
 And what about you? 
 Long day. Ah. 
 Every doctor has them. 
 And we go home, we learn from our mistakes. 
 The thing is... I didn't make one. 
 I was right not to report that pilot. 
 Wrong. 
 Drunk pilots should not be flying. 
 Period. 
 62 injured. 
 14 critical. 
 Do I feel bad about what happened? 
 Of course I do. 
 But patients need to know that when they come to us, we will keep their medical information private, good or bad. 
 Once we lose that trust, we can't help anyone, and people will die. 
 People did die because of your choice. 
 How do you not see that? I took an oath. 
 I get that you would have made a different choice. 
 The right one. For you. 
 But I don't want to be the kind of doctor you are. 
 Well... clearly, I've been wasting your time. 
 Hi. Hi. 
 Uh... what happened? 
 They fixed you. Well, not yet. 
 In a few days, we'll complete your reconstruction, but we will get you there. 
 I've never seen a hospital like this. 
 Where exactly are we? 
 Welcome to First Class. 
 Oh. 
 How long can we stay? 
 Oh. 
 You really need to deal with that back, Dr. Bell. 
 I threw my back out pole dancing last year, and it was no fun. 
 Mm. For you. 
 Hey. 
 How do you feel? 
 Awake. 
 Oh. Well, let's have a look. 
 Dr. Cain enlarged the covering over the back of your brain. 
 This will relieve the pressure that was causing your sleep apnea. 
 Just like that, huh? Just like that. 
 Just like that. 
 And the surgery cured your blood pressure. 
 This means I don't have to work in sales anymore. 
 I've never quit a job before. 
 But it's up to you now. 
 You got choices. 
 Choices. 
 Oh, I like the sound of that. 
 Thank you. 
 So dramatic, Randolph. 
 This is me taking your advice. 
 Yeah, it's a good look on you. 
 Well, if it doesn't work in a few weeks... 
 You won't need surgery if you do your exercises every day. 
 Don't be one of those patients who forgets. 
 Yeah, well, I have a feel... feeling you'll remind me. 
 Just doing my job. 
 Is this a job you've decided to stay in? 
 'Cause you set up meetings with other hospitals. 
 I did. 
 But I careabout the people here too much. 
 And I'm not giving up on any of you. 
 Oh. 
 Work him hard. 
 Oh. 
 So I guess you're the Bell whisperer. 
 Hardly. 
 I don't think anyone's quite figured out that man yet. 
 You talked an educated doctor out of a proven medical intervention. 
 Well, if Bell's mastered one thing, it's self-preservation. 
 Yes, and he also plays well with others, which is more than I can say for you. 
 Don't ever speak to me that way in the OR again. 
 I should say the same to you. 
 I can say whatever I want. 
 That's the difference between a surgeon who bills $80 million a year like me, and one that bills... two. 
 It's a good one. 
 I'm reading the chapter on episiotomies. 
 Yikes. 
 I threw this whole godmother thing at you fast, huh? 
 I understand if you're not comfortable with it. 
 I thought about it. 
 And? 
 It's been... a long time since someone asked me to sacrifice for family. 
 I don't really have any left. 
 We've both lost so much. 
 But you became my family a long time ago. 
 And if my sister has a child, then that child becomes my family, too. 
 No matter what. 
 Are you saying you'll be my baby's godmother? 
 You said yes? 
 I didn't have a choice. 
 Women who've had triple negative breast cancer have the highest recurrence rates in the first three years. 
 Not to mention the risk of developing ovarian cancer. 
 All right, so, what's your plan if Adaku's baby becomes your responsibility? 
 I don't have one. 
 Good night, guys. 
 Good night. 
 Busy day? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, um... 
 I thought about going to AA like you said, but I ended up back at the hotel. 
 There's a bar. 
 And it was late, so, when I got to the airport the next day, I was... 
 I was still pretty buzzed. 
 I was about to board when I heard the noise. 
 This crash wasn't my fault. 
 But the next one... it could be. 
 I need help. 
 I lost the pamphlet. 
 We got hundreds. Come on. 
 Spoke to Andrews. 
 No more P.E. deaths today. 
 Great. 
 What about tomorrow? 
 Making sure a drug is safe shouldn't be this hard. 
 If it is harming patients, it's only gonna get harder. 
 Red Rock, the pharmaceutical company-- you ready to take these guys on? 
 I keep thinking, what would Jessie want me to do? 
 ♪ Overdrive...♪ She made a lot of bad choices, but... she was fearless.

 We don't stop until we get it. 
 My shift ends in a few hours. 
 See you at home? 
 I like the sound of that.
