 Scrub in with The Resident. 
 We need to lock the ER down now! 
 See all-new episodes Tuesdays. 
 And check out our other Fox programs-- 
 Almost Family, 9-1-1 and Prodigal Son. 
 Let's solve a murder. 
 Only on Fox. 
 Previously onThe Resident... How did you get this place? 
 Are you sure right now is the right time to make this move? 
 I've never been so sure. 
 Remind me why I hired you. Your last assistant quit, and my dad is Zip Betournay. 
 He owns the Crystal Springs golf club. 
 I can find you a smoking hot date tonight. 
 I- I have someone in mind. 
 My ex-husband is so hard on Grayson, but I'm proud of him. He's a good son. 
 I can't let Jessie go without knowing what really happened. 
 Please, just take a look at this. 
 It's Jessie's medical records. I just, I just want to know that nothing terrible happened, everything was done right. 
 It's a terrible idea. 
 Oh, come on, just play along. 
 We live under the same roof now. 
 Which is amazing. Agreed, but people get on each other's nerves, which is why I'm proposing that we both get to pick one thing that drives the other one crazy. 
 Only one? 
 Cute. Yes. 
 And we both try to quell the thing in an effort to live happily ever after. 
 Fine. Good. You go first. 
 Okay. Here we go. Okay. 
 Go ahead. 
 You do this-this thing when you eat. 
 What? 
 Mmm. 
 Mmm... 
 Mmm. Mmm! 
 And that annoys you? 
 You have no idea. 
 I just like food. This is why I didn't want to do it. 
 All right, fine, yeah. No, you're right. 
 I can totally enjoy my food silently. 
 My turn. 
 Uh-oh. "Uh-oh" is right. 
 Receiving reports of a high-speed police chase in Midtown Atlanta involving two suspects believed to be armed. 
 Drivers in the affected area are being urged to stay off the roads. 
 Pursuit is heading north on Peachtree. 
 We have a problem. 
 You hang on. 
 Hey, you stay the hell awake. 
 If you keep driving like this, you're gonna die with me, brother. 
 Ain't nobody gonna die today. 
 That's good. Don't want yours to be the last face I see. 
 Almost... 
 Hey, you hang on. 
 A few more seconds, okay? 
 Listen up! We have a Code Silver. 
 We need to lock the ER down now! 
 Get everybody out of here now. Let's go. Hurry. 
 Ashley, come with me. 
 The driver's armed. 
 Okay, security, lock these two doors down, and nobody else in or out. Hey! 
 Quickly and quietly come this way. 
 Let's go. This way, in an organized fashion. Come on, come on, come on... 
 Thank you very much. Come on, quickly. 
 Everybody, get back! Let's go. 
 I need help! Go, go. 
 I'm a cop, he's not. 
 I need him alive! 
 Open up! 
 Detective Al Raines, Atlanta PD. FYI, I'm fine. 
 Yeah, with all that adrenaline going, Detective, you might not feel your injuries. 
 It's almost over, you son of a bitch. 
 I got your ass. Oh, you just stay tuned, Albie. 
 You stay tuned. You brought him here. 
 He's in our hands now. You need to trust us. All right? 
 Let's go over here. You can keepan eye on him from there. 
 All right? Yeah. 
 I'll trust you. 
 Just make sure your doctors don't trust him. 
 Can you bring me a lac tray? Thank you. 
 Ain't no soul in that man. 
 He runs a crew. 
 They do high-end home invasions. 
 Break in, tie up the family, steal everything. 
 Sometimes they let the people go. 
 Other times, maybe the homeowner catches a glimpse of a face they shouldn't, they execute 'em. 
 No mercy. 
 All right, everyone be careful. 
 Can you tell me your name? 
 Hey, Albie? They want to know my name. 
 Hey, you come on over here. 
 I'll show you where to find your name. 
 Airways intact. Decreased breathsounds on the left. 
 Got a tip earlier today. 
 Caught Rob and his crew in the act. 
 I cornered that b*st*rd. 
 Yeah, you sure did some damage. 
 After he impaled himself, I thought he might die right there on the spot. 
 Got him here as fast as I could. 
 The rest of Rob's crew got away. 
 They took the homeowner with them. 
 60-year-old grandfather. 
 It's only a matter of time before they realize they don't need that hostage anymore. 
 Rob knows where his crew is hiding out. 
 He's got to tell me where they are soon, otherwise... 
 Damn it. 
 Hey! Detective! 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey! Give it back! 
 Back up! Hey! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Give it up! Back up, man. 
 Let him go, let him go. I got it. 
 We're good. Good. 
 You enjoy that, Albie. 
 It's the last thing you're ever gonna get from me. 
 Okay, let's get him to CT carefully and let's call the OR and let them know we're coming. 
 Chaz, hold down the fort. I need to see another patient. 
 Devon, tag me back in if you need help with our detective friend. 
 I'm good. # All hail the king# 
 # That ol' new old-school type dude# 
 # The first to make the gangsta house shoes so cool 
 # First one to hop a six-four...# 
 Dr. Cain. You paged? 
 # Let's get it crackin'# 
 # I'm like, I'm the reason you're G-in'# 
 # Your boy don't do a lot of soul, but I'm seizin'...# 
 Thanks for stopping by. Didn't really have a choice. 
 Heard how your little chess game with Dr. Bell got you the funds for your clinic. 
 Well done. 
 Thank you. Clock my surgical board. 
 It's a full slate. 
 I'd like for you to work with me today, run pre-op on all my surgical patients. 
 Why me? 
 'Cause I demand the best, and that's you. 
 So ride with me through the first wave of surgeries and you can bail anytime after that, or... force me to find a more cunning way to make that happen. 
 Uh, that won't be necessary. 
 I'm sure one day in neuro won't kill me. 
 Or will it? 
 No, construction business is no joke. 
 You know, every step is a fall or a break or a shot to the ass, in my case. 
 I'm seeing you got shot with a nail gun at work. 
 Who'd you piss off? Self-inflicted. 
 Yeah, I'm a clumsy oaf. 
 Took two to the left cheek, which threw me off-balance and I tumbled off the second floor scaffolding. 
 Wounds got infected and my antibiotics jacked up my kidneys real good. 
 So that's why you're on dialysis? Yeah. 
 They say my kidneys are bouncing back. 
 And I was feeling pretty good until these damn migraines kicked in the last couple days. 
 Any other pain? 
 No. 
 Dizziness? No, but, Doc... much as I dig it here, I think I'd really prefer something for this migraine pain. 
 Mm-hmm. - ASAP, so I can get back to my work site. 
 My guys got to pull the extra load if I'm not there, so... 
 Well, I'm gonna run a test panel, make sure everything's okay, and then we'll go from there. 
 Good? Good. 
 Make yourself comfortable. 
 Be careful, Doc. 
 You make things too nice, I may never leave. 
 This isn't an herbal or energy supplement. 
 It's not a daily vitamin. 
 It's all three. 
 The best nutritional scientists in the country helped craft this groundbreaking product. 
 Six years and every disposable dime I had is on this table. 
 Put the Chastain name on the product, give me your brand in marketing,and together we will sell millions of units,guaranteed. 
 I'm sorry, this isn't real medicine. 
 I get it. 
 The supplement business is littered with con artists selling snake oil, and they are cleaning up in a $122 billion industry. 
 It is the Wild, Wild West out there, and supplements aren't regulated by the FDA. 
 Look, I get that this is outside of your comfort zone, but you can trust me. 
 My products are the real deal. 
 All I'm asking is for you to give me a chance. 
 You know, a hospital like Chastain can only associate itself with the highest standard of medical care. 
 And we don't take chances. 
 Thank you. 
 Steady. I want him in the OR in one piece. 
 How bad is it, fellas? Talk to me. 
 Detective, we got this. Relax.- Not possible. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 Time to fight the law and win, Pravesh. 
 You're not allowed in the OR. 
 Go back to the ER for observation. 
 Hey, I don't need observation! 
 Detective, if you keep following us, I will call security. 
 I have had ICE removed, I will have you removed, too. 
 Intern don't play. 
 He's in V-fib. 
 Okay, I got no pulse. Yeah, we need to start CPR right now. 
 Get these cuffs off. We can't roll him onto his back or move the impalement. 
 All right, let's start compressions from both sides. 
 Me and you, Pravesh. Let's go. 
 Easy, guys. 
 Better. 
 Let's go! 
 Remember, Docs, he dies, hostage dies. 
 He's crashing again. All right, back at it. 
 Do we have code meds? 
 What he needs is blood. 
 He's been down too long.- Okay, he's coding. 
 Chu, you know what to do. 
 Drape and intubate. You got it. 
 Nurse, take my place. Nolan, scrub room with me. 
 I'm in. Hang two units of O neg and start pressors. 
 All right, let's go. On my count? One, two, three. 
 Get his back. Guy's got a steel bar rammed through his chest. 
 Mostly, you don't survive that. 
 Adjust the attitude. It's my OR, my outcome, and I say he lives. 
 Aye, aye. 
 Come on, Pravesh, I need a living patient. 
 I cannot operate on dead people. 
 Well, I suppose I could, but why bother? 
 Holding compressions. Pulse check. 
 Sinus tach. Strong carotid pulse. 
 Congratulations, Pravesh. You just saved the life of a truly detestable human being. 
 Ten blade. 
 Make this quick, Doc. 
 I'm gonna be at Rob Spiro's bedside the moment he comes out of surgery. 
 Did you take any blows to the chest? 
 Did three tours in Afghanistan. 
 IED blew up my Humvee. 
 Couldn't hear for a week. 
 Think I went to see a doctor? Not once. 
 It's called strength of character. 
 Yeah, I did two tours myself, and anytime I have health issues, I still see a doctor. 
 It's called not being an idiot. 
 What unit? 
 Navy corpsman. Third Battalion Seventh Marines. 
 Battle of Sangin. 
 Heard that was a hell of a time, brother. 
 You have any head pain? 
 You're damn right I do. 
 He hit me in the head with a two-by-four. 
 Squeeze my fingers. 
 Ah. Doc, not with this one. 
 He stepped on my hand twice here. 
 I'm sending you for a CT scan. 
 No. Not a chance. 
 You may have life-threatening injuries. 
 In order to do my job, I need more information than just a standard exam. 
 Nah. 
 All right. 
 How about we start with an X-ray of your hand? 
 They're cheap and fast. 
 And it will help me with the diagnosis, brother. 
 Hey. 
 They're deep into Spiro's surgery. 
 He's touch and go. 
 If I didn't need information from him, I'd tell your guys to let him perish. 
 It doesn't work that way around here. 
 Oh, yeah? How's it work? 
 Saints, sinners, and everything in between. 
 We treat them all. 
 It doesn't matter what they've done before they come through our doors. 
 You don't care about their past. 
 I have to care about the future. 
 Another few hours pass, some bad guys with an innocent man are gonna realize they could run a lot faster without a hostage. 
 That happens, they'll put him down like a dog. 
 Please, do whatever you need to do so I can get what I need. 
 That way, nobody else has to die. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 This is embarrassing. I don't know why I'm crying. 
 Because you're human and you're scared. 
 I mean... spine surgery. 
 On my spine. 
 All those nerves. 
 It's dangerous and I don't want to do it. 
 I don't. 
 But the pain and weakness, and I miss my life, but... 
 One step at a time, okay? Here. 
 This is your MRI. 
 See the narrowing right here. 
 It's putting pressure on your spinal cord. 
 It's called spinal stenosis, and what Dr. Cain wants to do is a very common procedure called a laminectomy. 
 That's just gonna open up some space. 
 Only takes about an hour, and I'll be there to make sure everything runs as smoothly as it can. 
 Your surgery's at 4:15, so I'll probably have someone come up about a half hour before to take you to the OR. 
 Thank you for taking the time to tell me. 
 Sorry, fog-- frog in my throat. 
 How long have you had that? 
 Last month or so. 
 Hmm. 
 Do you have any blurred vision? Difficulty swallowing? 
 Yes. Is that a problem? 
 It could be. 
 Let me talk to Dr. Cain. 
 You hang in there, okay? 
 I will be with you the whole way, I promise. 
 # Get busy...# 
 Up, down, up, down, up. 
 All right. To the right. Come on. 
 Elbow to knee. Let's go, guys. Yup. 
 Weight on your heels. Let's go. 
 Set of eight. Let's go. 
 All right, you know what? 
 Let's, um, let's take a five-minute break. 
 Stretch, hydrate, and we're back, okay? 
 Good work. 
 If you are here to scold me about fake medicine, you can save your breath. 
 I'm broke. All right? 
 The business is finished. I'm dissolving the company. 
 Your supplements have potential. 
 You killed my pitch. 
 You said Chastain doesn't take chances. 
 They don't. I do. 
 I'm the one who brought you to the board this afternoon, and they were captivated by your passion, your confidence, your obvious intellect. 
 Your presentation was flawless. I'm not surprised. 
 You used me as a test case. 
 You do not want to be in business with Chastain and Red Rock. 
 They think of profit-sharing as a chronic disease. 
 They will shake your hand, then drive a knife in your back at the same time. 
 Listen, Andrea, I've spent the last year educating myself on the world of supplements and, specifically, your company. 
 I watch its every move, and unfortunately you've been walking into the wrong rooms. 
 There's nowhere left to go. 
 You're out of gas. 
 What are you proposing? 
 The amazing qualities you already bring to the table plus my face and the name Dr. Randolph Bell, CEO and Chief of Surgery on the label of millions of bottles of our supplements. 
 # You know me, you know me# 
 # I'm-a put the fire on the gasoline, get busy.# 
 Rick. 
 Hate to kick you out of this plush room, but all your tests came back negative. 
 So, you got, uh, normal electrolytes, normal blood counts. 
 You got a history of migraines, uh, this is presenting as another one. 
 I know that's not fun, but if you can handle a nail gunto the ass, you can handle this. 
 Hey, kidding aside, that's a relief. 
 With my dialysis, I was starting to think maybe it was something else, but... Yeah, well, I'll write you a prescription, should help you out with your migraines. Hey. 
 Thanks a bunch, Dr. Hawkins. All right, my pleasure. 
 Rick? Rick? 
 Code Blue! 
 Code Blue, room 5417. 
 I need some help in here! Code Blue, room 5417. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What happened to my patient? 
 Complaining of migraines, tests came back negative, then he coded. 
 Any new medications? Just on all the standard stuff. 
 Doxazosin, a statin, an EPO med. Could you have missed something? 
 Maybe you need to ask yourself that question. 
 That's exactly what I've been doing... 
 Because he received spotless care under my supervision. 
 Well, something went wrong. What are you implying, Dr. Hawkins? 
 I just want answers. 
 We'll get them soon enough. 
 Have you seen Dr. Cain? Uh-huh. 
 Are you here just to watch him? 
 Is that so wrong? 
 Nurse Sally watched him yesterday, twice. 
 Dr. Cain? 
 You haven't sealed off the aneurysm yet. 
 Place an 8.6-millimeter coil. 
 Yes? I need to talk to you about your pre-op patient, Mia Danvers. 
 Okay, go ahead, but hurry. 
 I think she may have something other than spinal stenosis. 
 No, Rodriguez, you need more stability. 
 Add an interbody spacer to the posterior vertebral body. 
 And you completed seven years of neurosurgery residency? 
 I'm a nurse practitioner. 
 Yes, exactly, and why is a nurse practitioner trying to re-diagnose my patient? 
 Full stop. You recruited me to work on your unit. 
 Mia Danvers has atypical symptoms. 
 I want to run some tests. 
 This is all healthy brain tissue. Good margins. 
 Nice work, Timmons. 
 You can run as many tests as you like. 
 Mia Danvers will be on my tablein OR One at 4:15. 
 Dr. Cain, do you always let your residents operate when you're not in the room? 
 Dr. Meyer, call Admitting. 
 I am there for the crucial part of each surgery. 
 Always? 
 My residents are second to none. They rarely make mistakes. 
 And if they do, yes, I'm always there to correct them. 
 So have no fear, Nurse Nevin. 
 All is well. 
 Do I detect notes of mango and chia? 
 A delightful hint of acai? 
 They say it increases stamina. 
 Yeah, but, I mean, is that, like, scientifically proven? 
 Proof's not required. 
 People believe what they want to believe. 
 The placebo effect works. 
 If you think that acai will give you an energy boost, chances are, it will. 
 But why you? 
 I mean, you're already, like, a top dog doctor. 
 I mean, you're Dr. freaking Bell. 
 You ever heard of the amazing Dr. Oz? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Dr. Sanjay Gupta? 
 The-the dude on CNN. Yeah, I love that guy. 
 Before you walked through the doors of Chastain, had you ever heard of Dr. Randolph Bell? 
 No. 
 They're household names, I'm not. 
 But a $5 million investment will get me in the game. 
 So we need to find someone close with very deep pockets. 
 That's, uh, kind of steep, Dr. B. 
 I mean, who would pony up that kind of cash? 
 I'm gonna give you a hint. Who do we both know who's local, wealthy, and has capital to spare? 
 Who has offices in Buckhead and made his money betting on risky ventures? 
 Who contributed half your DNA? 
 Oh, my-my pops! My dad. 
 Ah. Set up a meeting, stat. 
 Yeah, you got it, boss. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? Yeah. 
 You don't look okay. 
 What's up? 
 A patient of mine... everything seemed fine. 
 Was about to discharge him, and then he just... coded. 
 No signs, no symptoms. Dead before he hit the floor. 
 I'm so sorry. I keep going over everything in my head. 
 What did I miss? 
 I have to figure out why. Why-why did it happen? 
 You will. Here. 
 It's okay. 
 Here you go, sir. 
 Well, the good news is your hand isn't broken. 
 Hallelujah. I'm out of here, man. But... something else must be wrong, so I'm keeping you in the hospital a little while longer, run some more tests. 
 Doc. No. Come on. 
 You're being ridiculous, man. 
 I'm not discharging you until I'm a hundred percent positive you're okay. 
 You should call someone. 
 Get them to bring you a change of clothes, and you'll need a medical proxy. 
 Is it looking that bad for me over there? 
 It's just standard protocol. 
 Aw, shh... 
 Damn, gonna be honest, man. 
 Besides an ex-wife and a few drinking buddies, nobody's gonna come bring me a fresh pair of underwear. 
 You know... or make no medical decisions for me, man. 
 I've spent the last five years thinking about catching bad guys. 
 Especially the one you got in your OR right now. Everything else, every-- everyone else became background noise. 
 You all right? 
 : Look out. Can't see that good. 
 Around the edges. 
 Can I have a look? 
 Ah... 
 Nurse? 
 I need some fluids. He's hypotensive. 
 Hey, Detective. 
 Time to wake up. 
 Hey. 
 What the hell happened? 
 You passed out. You can be mad at me all you want. 
 Keeping you in the hospital. 
 You're lucky to be alive, you know. 
 The cop said you once crammed yourself underneath a kitchen sink for hours during a home invasion. 
 That true? 
 Do you ever get pain in your knees and joints? 
 Yeah. Always. 
 How'd you know that? 
 That hurt? 
 I don't feel it. 
 Elastic skin, abnormal flexibility, atrophic scars... and pseudotumors. 
 I think you might have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. 
 They call it the Stretch Armstrong disease. 
 It is associated with aneurysms. 
 They can burst at any time. 
 Do you have kids? 
 A d... a daughter. 
 Why? 
 Ehlers-Danlos is genetic. 
 If she has aneurysms, it can be very dangerous. 
 
 
 
 She's going to need aggressive surveillance. 
 You mean she can die from it? 
 Yes. 
 But I can manage her care. 
 I'd like to see her. 
 I got no idea where she is. 
 I haven't spoken to her in ten years. 
 She wants nothing to do with me. 
 Do you have a phone number? 
 Mm. 
 How about a name? 
 I can track her down. 
 Everybody dies of something. 
 Intimal flap on the aorta root. 
 Aortic dissection. 
 And look at all these discontinuities. 
 Thoracic and lumbar spinal fractures. 
 All from a fistfight? 
 A lifetime of fistfights. 
 I'll break the news to him. 
 I'll page cardio and neuro. 
 Raptor and Cain? 
 That should be interesting. 
 Okay, my friend, we looked at your scans. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Whoa, easy. 
 There you go. 
 Wow. I've delivered enough bad news in my career to know that look. 
 Rip off the Band-Aid, Hawkins. 
 You have an aortic dissection and multiple fractures in your spine. 
 Separately, neither would be dangerous. 
 Together... 
 It's time for prayer? 
 I'm prepping the OR now. 
 Chastain has the best surgeons in Atlanta. 
 Your odds are good. 
 You be honest with me. 
 If the operation doesn't kill me, could it put me in a wheelchair? 
 Got to be able to be a cop. 
 Yeah. 
 If I can't be a cop... life's not worth living. 
 Let's not go there. 
 What is your backup plan? 
 What would you do if you couldn't be a doctor? 
 Captain. 
 Detective Raines is headed into surgery as we speak. 
 Is he gonna be okay? It's serious but repairable. 
 I'll keep you all posted, I promise. Please do. 
 Uh, can I talk to you for a second? 
 I have a favor to ask. 
 Anything. Name it. 
 I need a phone number or an address for Rob Spiro's daughter. 
 She could be in serious medical jeopardy. 
 I need to examine her. Look, respect for your profession, but don't waste another second on that animal or his family. 
 She didn't choose her father. 
 You're blaming the victim. 
 You're a cop. Aren't you supposed to do the exact opposite? 
 Dr. Hawkins, I was just about to call you. You got the results of my dialysis patient? 
 Reason he dropped dead without warning is he had a massive pulmonary embolism. 
 He's not the only one. 
 We've had five other patients drop dead from massive P.E.s just in the past six weeks. 
 At Chastain? 
 In the past six weeks? 
 All dialysis patients. 
 Nic's sister Jessie Nevin, she was a dialysis patient here. 
 First the robber, now the cop. 
 They're all the same on the inside. 
 Yeah. 
 Dr. Austin. 
 Dr. Cain. 
 We'll be repairing the aortic dissection first. 
 Happy for you to assist, but you will be doctor number two. Well, it's an interesting proposition, but I'm no one's assistant. 
 I'm certainly not number two. 
 Well, then you can monitor the nerve function. 
 Or I can repair the spinal fracture first. 
 The aorta is the priority. 
 It's literally tearing apart. The spinal cord is being transected-- it could literally paralyze him. 
 The aortic dissection could kill him on the spot. 
 Doctor number three is gonna go prep. 
 Okay, last stitch... and the aortic root has been reconstructed. 
 You're missing a step in the Yacoub technique. 
 No, this is the David technique-- it's what we'd prefer at Stanford. 
 Not at Hopkins. Our studies showa lower mortality rate. 
 Only when the aortic annulus is less than 27 millimeters. 
 Our patient is 28 millimeters. 
 Then reinforce the suture lines. 
 Coronaries need to be properly reperfused before you restart his heart. 
 We're good, but thank you. 
 Take him off bypass. 
 We don't want our guy to get an M.I. I'll handle the heart. 
 You stick with the brain. 
 Brain commands the heart. 
 Yeah, well, the heart powers the brain. 
 All right, Nolan, go ahead and decannulate. 
 Time to make space so doctor number two can access the spine. 
 You're more than welcome to stay afterwards. 
 Be happy to have you retract a few layers of soft tissue. 
 Someone has to do it. 
 Patient's crashing. What the hell? 
 This was an easy access. Aneurysm rupture. 
 Get the cell saver. 
 I'm gonna use my hands to stop the bleed. 
 Bleeding stopped. Good call. 
 All right. 
 The tear spread through the iliac. 
 Grab the vascular clamps. 
 Go proximal. 
 Done. Now distal. 
 He's about to code. 
 It's on the backside. I can't see where the tear ends. 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Okay, right here. 
 Slide the clamp along my fingers. 
 Got it. 
 Blood pressure stabilized. 
 Well done, doctor number one. 
 Back at you, doctor number two. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, I've been in the health care field a long time, and I have never seen anything so promising. 
 Supplements are a $122 billion industry with multiple areas of growth. 
 Shift your weight forward and down. 
 Get more distance on your shot. 
 And collagen? On fire. 
 30% growth, $100 million. 
 With my medical reputation and your business savvy, we can make a fortune. 
 Uh, make sure your hands don't cross the swing plane. 
 This can be good for Grayson, as well. 
 Give a bright young man with a few bad habits some guidance. 
 Get your son started on a new path. 
 Magnificent effort. 
 The shot or the pitch? 
 Both. 
 Let's draw up the papers. 
 Just, uh... one ground rule before going to business together. 
 Fire away. No secrets between partners. 
 No more schtupping my wife. 
 Here are the lab results you ordered. 
 Mia Danvers doesn't need surgery. 
 Hey. In a rush? Hey. 
 My patient with spinal stenosis-- turns out she has myasthenia gravis. 
 That's what's causing all her symptoms? 
 Yes. And we can treat it with meds. I just need Cain to cancel the surgery. I don't want him opening her up if he doesn't have to. 
 Cain finished early on Detective Raines. 
 Probably squeezed your patient into the OR. Damn it. 
 Did you need something from me?- It can wait. 
 Go. 
 Ten blade. 
 I don't understand. You didn't do the surgery? 
 Turns out you have what's called myasthenia gravis. It's an autoimmune disease. 
 It can be controlled through the medication. 
 :Oh, thank you so much, Dr. Cain. 
 Thank Nurse Nevin. She's the one that caught it. 
 She seems relieved. 
 Take one guess how much your due diligence cost this hospital today. No, allow me. 
 Mia's surgery would have run 75 grand, give or take, not including the recovery, so let's just call it 
 $150,000 all-in. 
 I'm not in the business of putting people into surgery if they don't need it. 
 Which is exactly why I handpicked you. 
 It should come as no surprise that I'd like to offer you a permanent position on my neurosurgery staff. 
 Give you more opportunities to shine, make a lot more money than you're making now. 
 But I'm guessing you don't care so much about that last part. 
 Take your time. Think about it. 
 I have another surgery to do, which is no doubt a necessary one. 
 Have to make up for lost revenue. 
 The corporate structure will be an LLC with partner ownership vesting in two-year increments which is standard, and starting at ten percent. 
 Except for me. I'll own 65%. 
 Any advance of money... 
 He'll own 65%? 
 How much money is he investing? 
 Six. Six... 
 Million. 
 ...be deemed a debt owed by the partnership and not an increase in capital contribution... 
 Why didn't you tell me that you'd reconciled with your husband? It was only three weeks ago. 
 We're keeping things open this time around. 
 Does he know that? 
 Any questions? 
 To new partners. 
 And some old ones. 
 This is gonna be awesome. 
 L'chaim. L'chaim. 
 So, Doc... am I gonna live? 
 Surgery was a success. 
 Thank you. 
 Uh... 
 What about Spiro? 
 The son of a bitch gonna make it? 
 He should. He's recovering. 
 I'm gonna need to see him. 
 No witnesses. 
 We both know that's not gonna happen. 
 Actually, we don't. 
 Never broken any rules? 
 It's written all over your face. 
 You do whatever it takes to save people. 
 You and me, we not that different. 
 Spiro's crew has a hostage. 
 His life is hanging in the balance. 
 We're his last hope. 
 You tell me I'm wrong. 
 Turn off Rob's morphine. 
 You can't be serious. 
 And then we add a dose of Narcan. 
 That should wake him up. 
 His pain level would skyrocket. 
 I want to clear his system of drugs. 
 I'm worried about his airway. 
 No, you're not. He would go into shock. 
 What you're talking about is torture. 
 What I'm talking about is this man, who will die unless Rob Spiro tells us where he's being held and he tells us now. 
 Conrad, I get that you are trying to help this man, but that... Don't lecture me on my motivations. 
 Hold on a second. Wait. 
 The cops said they found Spiro's daughter. 
 I can contact her, get her to come into the hospital, and when he sees her he might have a change of heart. 
 He doesn't give a damn about his daughter. 
 What? You don't know that. 
 "Everybody dies of something"? 
 His words. You told me yourself. 
 This is not our job. 
 We-we are doctors. We save lives. 
 We already saved Rob's life. 
 Now we make him a little bit uncomfortable so that we save another. 
 You're crossing a line. 
 I am doing the most good for the greatest number of people. 
 Don't do this. 
 It has to be done. 
 I want no part of it. 
 Thanks, Connie. This was the scene earlier this evening at an abandoned warehouse in Downtown Atlanta, where an active hostage situation ended peacefully with three arrests. 
 They rescued him, huh? 
 ...officers have emerged with Jason Wyans, the hostage taken earlier today during yet another home invasion. 
 Wonder how they found him. 
 ...the rest of Rob Spiro's crew are now in police custody. 
 And I wonder what's that thing I do that drives you nuts. 
 I've been bracing myself all day. I thought you'd never ask. Hmm. 
 You don't like it when I'm barefoot? 
 What are you doing? 
 The socks. 
 What? 
 You leave socks all over the place. 
 It's the thing that makes me crazy. 
 It's-it's like a sock trail all over the house. 
 No, I do not. 
 You do. Look, there's-there's a pair over there. 
 Men's, size ten. 
 Sometimes a little sweaty. 
 Okay. 
 I can work on that. Uh... 
 Like, I mean... I will definitely work on that. Like, work real hard on it. 
 Very hard. 'Cause it's... gross. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. 
 What's wrong? 
 The patient you lost earlier? 
 Sort of. 
 You have been... beating yourself up over Jessie's death, about how you pushed for the transplant surgery. 
 What's this about, Conrad? 
 Jessie died of a pulmonary embolism. 
 A complication from surgery. 
 Five other dialysis patients died at Chastain over the last six weeks. 
 All from pulmonary embolisms. 
 I think whatever killed your sister, it killed them, too. 
 We need to figure out what it was.
