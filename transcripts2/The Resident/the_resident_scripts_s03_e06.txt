 Scrub in with The Resident. 
 We need to lock the ER down now! 
 See all-new episodes Tuesdays. 
 And check out our other Fox programs-- 
 Almost Family, 9-1-1 and Prodigal Son. 
 Let's solve a murder. 
 Only on Fox. 
 Previously onThe Resident... 
 You told maintenance about us? 
 I'm gonna tell everyone! 
 You are my son and I know you. 
 And I also know that one day you will want to meet your biological mother. 
 That woman is a stranger who threw me away. 
 I do not want to meet her. When you're ready, you go see her. I want you to meet Cain and get to know him. 
 I would just like you to have this man as an ally. Page me if there's any surprises. You're not leaving this man's nerve function to a third-year. 
 Get back there and do your job. 
 You cross lines that I would never cross. 
 We are very different people, and neither of us are ever gonna change. 
 Five other dialysis patients died. 
 Whatever killed your sister, it killed them, too. 
 One click is all it takes to get immediate access to the records of any patient on the drug. 
 You could be fired for accessing medical records for patients that aren't yours. 
 If we can't get the answers any other way... 
 Okay, you got this. You got it, you got it. 
 Hand. Two hand. Huh? 
 Carpal tunnel? Oh, 'cause there's a celebrity called "Carpal Tunnel." Don't hate. 
 Think he's giving you something. He's-he's giving you something. 
 Uh, me-me. Ceiling? 
 Oh... - Oh, my God. - Ten seconds! 
 Do something different, do something different! Yeah, okay... 
 Give me a ceiling. Give-give me a microphone. 
 Give-give me a house! Time! 
 Give me a break! Rick Astley! 
 Obviously. I'm lost. 
 "Never gonna give you up." 
 Wow. I mean, come on. 
 I'm gonna raise. 
 Call your 200... raise you five. 
 Out. 
 Can't take the heat, huh? 
 Call. 
 Two pair. 
 Two pair, aces and kings. 
 Yeah. All right. You're the man, Dr. B. 
 Let's play some real poker, boys. 
 $1,000 ante. 
 Here you go. Thank you. 
 Those two seem okay, after their man-breakup. 
 No. Breakup's a bit harsh. Conscious uncoupling? 
 They're just not working directly together anymore. 
 Speaking of work, I can't be in the clinic tomorrow. 
 Um, do you have a better offer? 
 I wish. No, I'm working on neuro. 
 We lost another nurse. 
 And Red Rock's policies are not helping at all. 
 Keep cutting days off, adding shifts, all these overlapping surgeries... 
 Yeah, that'll mean more double shifts. 
 Or triples, if triples were a thing. 
 What's going on? 
 E- mail update from the review board. 
 They are still "working on" my request for hemopleatin data. 
 It's taking too long. I know. 
 The more time, the more patients could die. 
 Like Jessie. 
 I need 20 new celebrity names from everyone. 
 Let's go. 
 Exactly how often will we be throwing these game nights? 
 Once a month. 
 Up to you, gentlemen. 
 All right. I'll-I'll go all in. 
 Come on. You know I'm out of cash. 
 What else you got? 
 Horace Dudley. 
 Ortho, 70 years old. Keep talking. 
 In and out every couple of months for persistent back pain. 
 X- rays, CTs, MRIs, nerve conduction studies, steroid injections. 
 I've performed multiple microdiscectomies, and still he wants more. 
 You're betting a patient? 
 Insurance? 
 Silver hair. Platinum insurance. 
 I say the pot's right. 
 What do you got? 
 Flush to the ace. 
 It's a good hand. 
 Not good enough. 
 Full house, queens over eights. 
 Sorry about that. 
 Horace Dudley is now my patient. 
 Hemopleatin is Chastain's standard of care for chronic anemia patients. 
 Can't change that because of a hunch. 
 It's more than a hunch, but yes. 
 That's why we need more evidence. 
 How long has it been standard? 
 Since the last administration. 
 Here. This is every Chastain patient who's on hemopleatin. 
 They're all confidential. 
 Their names are listed, but you can't get access to their charts without getting flagged. 
 You see that's not normal, right? 
 Conrad, your father's on this list. 
 He's had blood transfusions for Crohn's flare-ups. 
 He must have chronic anemia, so his GP put him on hemopleatin to help. 
 I got a patient. 
 And if you two get caught digging into files you have no access to, keep my name out of it. 
 You got to get him off that. 
 He just got back in town last night. 
 I'll have him come in. 
 I'll call some friends at Atlanta General. 
 Someone should be able to tell me if they're using it, too. 
 If they really appreciated us, they'd get more nurses, not cookies. 
 Mm. Mm. 
 Or at least better cookies. Ugh. 
 You don't know this about me, but I make a mean oatmeal raisin. 
 Hmm. Maybe for next game night. 
 Yeah, that sounds good. 
 In fact, maybe we could host. 
 You know? Maybe we could, um... move in together and then host. 
 Honey, I... 
 I'm just not into living with a boy before marriage. 
 I've done that more than once. 
 Oh. This artist in Paris and a teacher in Conyers, so... 
 The one in Paris was way better. 
 So, I don't know, it's just not my thing anymore. 
 Okay? 
 Morning, Horace, I'm Dr... Dr. Cain. 
 Yes. Dr. McGill told us that you'd be taking over Horace's care. 
 He spoke very highly of you. 
 Your mug's on the side of the building, so you must be the best. I can't deny that. 
 And I'm Nic, the nurse practitioner on your case. 
 How are you feeling today, Horace? 
 Better than before my last surgery, but worse since my last injection. 
 His lumbar spinal fusion, the last epidural. 
 Those are beautiful. 
 She keeps busy when we're here. 
 We're here a lot. So I looked at your scans, and good news: all the problems you've had for decades, I can fix them. 
 Permanently. 
 Where is he? Wha... Uh, Dr. Bell? He is 15 out, and then he's going straight to PT. 
 Thank you, Grayson. No problemo. 
 Do you know anything about an ortho patient named Horace Dudley? 
 Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Cain got him with a baller hand. 
 Trip-queens over eights. 
 Dr. Cain won my patient in a poker game? 
 This man in need of a miracle. 
 Is this the patient you won in poker? 
 Yeah, that's correct. 
 Now, look at the degeneration of the discs. No wonder he's been in and out of here for years. Yeah, so what's your plan? 
 Cervical spinal fusions? 
 If I wanted to go the ordinary route, yeah, sure. 
 But I'm not ordinary. 
 Artificial disc surgery. 
 But not just one. 
 I'm gonna replace all four of the affected discs. 
 What, a four-level disc replacement? 
 Has that ever been done? Not in the United States. 
 So when I'm done, Horace Dudley will have a bionic spine. 
 There are no U.S. studies on long-term outcomes for multiple artificial discs. 
 Every study needs a first patient. 
 Horace Dudley will be that patient. 
 Well, great. I'll just need to see the overseas data before I can sign off on the surgery. 
 Sure. I'll send them right now. 
 Oh. Mm. 
 Dr. Broome. 
 Uh... Bonnie. 
 Please call me that. 
 I- I know you have a mom, Dr. Austin. 
 They call him A.J. 
 So, lunch? 
 A poker game? Are you kidding me? 
 Good morning to you, too. No. You can't gloss this over. 
 This is wrong on every level imaginable. 
 You gambled a person. 
 Look, now, hold it. That wasn't me. 
 A bunch of men drinking, betting, gambling with a life. 
 You're complicit. So, what are you actually mad about? 
 The drinking? The gambling? Men in general? 
 Patients are human beings with needs, not poker chips. 
 Horace Dudley is my ortho patient who sometimes makes the uninformed choice of finding surgeons to do operations I've warned him against. 
 I've been encouraging him to go to PT, and now, after one night of Texas hold 'em... 
 What does it matter how Cain got him? 
 This is a patient who is going to go to a neurosurgeon. 
 He's proved that over and over. 
 And Cain's as good as McGill. He's better even. 
 This is a radical surgery that might paralyze or kill him. 
 It's a proven technique; it just hasn't made its way here yet. 
 Oh, and because it's Cain, and he brings in millions, we have no problem being the first. 
 Well, somebody has to, you know that. 
 Forget it. I'm going to the board. 
 I'll tell them he trades patients over cards, publicize his surgical notes, file a complaint with the AMA. 
 No, don't. Don't. Why the hell not? 
 Be-Because this is why I'm keeping him close. 
 The board will side with Cain, and he... he'll destroy you. 
 I don't want to see that happen. 
 Thanks for the vote of confidence. 
 Oh, Kit, come on. 
 What... Wh-What are you gonna do? 
 Turn your head all the way to the left for me. 
 Stop when you hit pain. 
 Uh, uh, r-right there.- Okay. 
 That-that hurts. - Okay, now go all the way back to the right. 
 This stops now. 
 How can I help you, Dr. Voss? 
 How about you start by telling your patient the truth? 
 Horace has already been fully briefed on his upcoming surgery. 
 Dr. Cain won you in a poker game. 
 Excuse me? 
 Your original neurosurgeon, Dr. Vince McGill, ran out of chips, so he put your name in the pot. 
 Like betting a car. 
 Only he bet you, and lost. 
 Lab extension 2419... 
 What'd you have? 
 Full house, queens over eights. 
 I won 20 grand in Vegas once, queens over eights. 
 He thought he had me with a flush. 
 Of course, he didn't. 
 I remember one time, about three months ago, right, I drew sixes on a big blind. Flop, nothing. 
 The river was sweet. 
 You know what it was, yeah. Yeah. 
 Thanks for getting here so fast. 
 Well, when my son summons me for an ASAP checkup, I do as I'm told. 
 How's the device company? 
 It's never easy to challenge the status quo, but you know that. Yeah. 
 So, what's going on? Hopefully nothing. 
 I'm just a little concerned about one of the meds you're on, so I wanted to check you out. 
 I feel fine. Couple of Crohn's flares now and then, but, uh, the steroids help. 
 All right, we're just right here. 
 Leg swelling? Chest pain? 
 No, none of that. 
 Breathing okay? 
 Well, a little shortness of breath here and there, but I figure that's age, plus a little too much room service on the road. 
 Okay, I'll do a quick exam down here, and then we'll run up to CT, so I can rule out a blood clot. 
 I missed you. 
 I missed you, too. 
 Did I tell you Nic and I got chickens? 
 Hi, good morning. Hi, I'm Dr. Okafor. 
 Rosie. This is Lacy. 
 And... 
 I'm sorry, I just... You're fine. 
 Thank you. 
 I've had to be strong for her, you know. 
 What are Lacy's symptoms? 
 She used to be so smart. 
 All this energy, all these friends. 
 And now her teachers say that she's not playing with anyone at recess, and she can't keep up in class. 
 They might hold her back. 
 A mental disorder wouldn't cause this kind of lethargy. 
 I will run some tests, and then we can see what we're dealing with. 
 Um... will it take a long time? 
 We don't have clinics in Dawson, and the hospital is so expensive. 
 I already had to take off a shift at the diner to drive here. 
 I was only supposed to take three hours, and you know traffic coming into Atlanta. 
 I will do everything I can to help you both. 
 Thanks. 
 I got to take this. I'll meet you guys inside. 
 Yo. 
 So I have an out if you need one. 
 Oh, well, that's tempting. What is the out? 
 A child with an undiagnosed condition and heart murmur. 
 You and Mother of Raptors could come in for a consult. 
 Hard pass. 
 You're just trying to get a look at my bio mom. 
 I'm trying to save this family the expense of an ER visit. 
 I'll think about it. 
 I'll be back to you. 
 Jessica doesn't want to move in with me unless we're married. 
 You know she lived with an artist? In Paris. 
 I've never even been to Paris. 
 I'm not sure what you're looking for here. 
 Jessica's done all this stuff, right? 
 She's had real relationships before me. 
 I haven't. Not really. 
 You know the one time I downloaded a dating app, I was too freaked out to even open it. 
 Now all I do is pay student loans and hang out with you. 
 I'm boring. 
 I've never even had car s*x. 
 Does an RV count? 
 Look, Jessica took her path, you took yours. 
 They brought you to each other. 
 Don't let insecurity ruin a good thing. 
 Okay, Dr. Wisdom. 
 Okay, no, I know that I'm not exactly the guy to give out relationship advice. 
 The woman I left at the altar is now dating some hotshot sportscaster in San Francisco while I spend my days with you. 
 So do as I say, not as I do. 
 Hi, Mr. Jones. 
 No, Jonesy, if you would. Please. 
 Hurt your arm, Jonesy? 
 Fat Charlie got his revenge. 
 Was it because you called him Fat Charlie? 
 :No, no. Fat Charlie is my horse. 
 I know what you're thinking. 
 I'm too old to still be a professional jockey. 
 My wife tells me every day. 
 Of course, she's a horse trainer, so she can work forever. 
 Is she here yet? 
 She hasn't checked in. 
 Preemptive apology if she's a little much. She worries. 
 It's understandable. Maybe it's time to quit. 
 Never. 
 If I'm not on the back of a horse, I'm not alive. 
 You got to fix me up. 
 Jonesy, you have a fracture of your distal radius. 
 See that? 
 Now, yours is easily treatable and won't need surgery, but we're also seeing signs of low bone density. 
 We need to run some tests. Okay? We'll be back. 
 That's another thing I've never done. 
 What, break your arm? No, ride a horse. Have you? 
 Yeah. 
 See? 
 Let me guess, third cup? 
 Fourth. You? Second. 
 I need to catch up. Mm. 
 You're not the only one. 
 Hey, Cindy. Mm? 
 Wake up. 
 What time is it? I was gonna say time to prep Cain's OR, but I don't think you should be doing that right now. 
 It's okay. I'm fine. You're exhausted. 
 Who isn't?We're overstaffed, underlapped. 
 Flipped around, upside down. 
 Sorry, coffee just kicked in. 
 With all these overlapping surgeries, they don't think about us. 
 Nurses and techs-- we're here early to set up the ORs. 
 And we stay after and make sure everything is cleaned up. 
 First in, last out, from one OR to the next. 
 All so Red Rock can schedule more operations and make more money. 
 No comment. 
 But I'm pulling rank. Go home, get some rest. 
 I'll look around, there's got to be someone who can swap with you. Me. I got you covered. 
 Jessica, you just finished back-to-back surgeries, too. 
 Well, then I'll be in back-to-back-to-back surgeries. 
 I may as well ride this second wind. 
 Okay. 
 Scalpel. 
 Retractor. 
 Curette. 
 You've hardly spilled a drop of blood. 
 Anything is possible in my OR. 
 Disc. 
 You okay in there? Great. 
 Like a free nap. 
 How's he doing? So far so good. 
 Nice to see you, Marshall. 
 Okay, I just have a second. 
 Jessica's covering for Cindy in the OR, so I'm trying to find someone to cover for Jessica on the floor. 
 Anyway, I heard back from my friend at General. 
 Hemopleatin patients have died there, too. 
 A dialysis patient. Had a PE just like Jessie. 
 He had two kids. 
 We need those records. 
 And someone in Oncology who has more access. 
 I'm gonna try something else. 
 Do you have any nurses who can help out in Neuro? 
 Cain scheduled way more than we can manage. 
 Sorry, we're short, too. 
 Happy freakin' Nurses' Day. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Can I steal you for 30 seconds? 
 I got 20. What's up? 
 You did that rotation in Oncology. 
 Were there any doctors that... might be willing to think outside the box? 
 I'm not sure what you mean. 
 Conrad and I think there's a problem with this drug, hemopleatin. 
 We're trying to find a doctor who will share patient outcomes, but if we can't... - You mean open patient records that aren't yours. 
 That's an invasion of privacy, plus it's illegal. 
 You could be fired. 
 My sister might have died because of this drug. 
 So, honestly, I don't give a damn. 
 Rules exist for a reason, Nic. 
 You can't just go break them because in the moment you think it's right. 
 You and Conrad, I love you guys, but I thought I made myself clear: 
 I am not going to be that kind of doctor. 
 But we'd only been dating a month. 
 It was more like three weeks. 
 I can't even say for sure we were in love. 
 You were in love, I was in lust. 
 Let her talk. 
 Medical school was like a dream. 
 Full ride, good grades. 
 I understand. You had priorities. 
 No. No, not priorities. 
 That's... No, that's... 
 Harsh. We were kids. 
 She could have ended the pregnancy. 
 Credit us that. We saw it through. 
 I managed to stay in med school. 
 I hid the pregnancy from everyone. 
 And then... we... Then you gave me away. 
 There's no judgment here. Really, there isn't. 
 But we should at least be honest, right? 
 I mean, he didn't want me because he didn't think I was his. 
 And then, by the time I was born, you decided you were going to be together, so next thing you know, you got married and you had three more kids. 
 The marriage was fast, the kids were not. 
 They came ten years later. It's... 
 At 22, it wasn't just Lamar who wasn't ready. 
 I didn't think I would be a good mother. 
 I still don't know if I ever was. 
 But I knew I would be a good doctor. 
 A really good one. 
 And it was a time when there were almost no doctors who looked like me. 
 That mattered. 
 I had a goal, a mission, something to prove, and I proved it. 
 You know what? Since you're such a good doctor, can you do me a favor? 
 Come with me to a peds consult. 
 Right now? 
 Yeah. 
 Stay. 
 Eat. 
 Well, that expression doesn't look like, "Hey, Dad, you're dying." 
 Lungs are clear. No blood clots. 
 Good. Now why don't you tell me the part you wouldn't tell me before? 
 The drug you're on, hemopleatin... 
 ...I think it may have caused Jessie's death. 
 Nic knows? Yeah. 
 Not easy. 
 Right now we only have an ecdotal evidence that it happened. 
 I need access to a large sample of patients, and I can't even get the data from this hospital. 
 And I work here. 
 Conrad, let me in. 
 Maybe I can help. 
 Henrietta. Yes, dear? 
 What's wrong? I can't breathe. 
 Oh... Somebody help! 
 Help! 
 Call a Code Blue, get me an intubation kit. 
 What's happening? 
 His throat is closing. 
 It's a complication of Cain's surgery. 
 We need to intubate him. 
 Hang in there, Horace. 
 Throat's swollen shut. 
 I can't get it in. Sat's 70%. 
 Did somebody call Cain? It went to voice mail. 
 He's suffocating. We're out of time. We need an airway. 
 That's it. We can't wait. Get me a cric kit now. 
 Code team's on their way. Wait, you're gonna cric him? 
 Sats? -60%. 
 Then, yeah, I'm cricing him. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 Trach tube. 
 We're in. 
 02 sats are rising. 
 What in God's name happened here? 
 This is Cain's patient. Have you paged him? 
 Cain signed out. He's not answering pages, texts, carrier pigeons. - Well, then, wait until you do hear from him. 
 If the patientisn't emergent... The patient needed to be criced because of Cain's operation. 
 I can fix him now, I'm not waiting. Let's just give Cain a couple of hours. 
 Because you're worried about what he'll say if I do this. No, Kit. 
 Because I'm worried about what he will do to you. 
 It'll be bad for you if you take one of Cain's patients to surgery without consulting him. 
 Horace is my patient now, and I didn't win him with a card game. 
 I got him because Cain's unjustifiable experiment nearly killed the man. 
 His life is still in jeopardy, so I must try and save him. 
 And I hope to God I can. 
 It looks like Jonesy has early-onset osteoporosis. 
 His chart says he's got celiac. 
 Low bone density is a common problem. 
 Not if he's stays gluten-free, which he says he is. 
 Mm. He can't keep riding. 
 Another fall and his bones could shatter like glass. 
 Poor guy. We have to break it to him. 
 
 
 
 Well, at least he got to have the experience in the first place. 
 Wendy Jones? 
 Right here. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. Hi. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 You almost done here? Yep, shift's over. 
 You want to grab a bite to eat?- Not quite. 
 You have a suit? 
 Uh, I'm not a three-year-old. 
 Yeah, I have a suit. Great. 
 Get it, put it on, let's meet back here in one hour. 
 I'll text you the details. 
 Whoa, whoa, wait. Where are we going? 
 D.C. D.C.? 
 Yeah. My jet's fueled up and on the runway. 
 I think I can get you all of the data you could ever need. 
 He said his stomach hurt and then he started throwing up. 
 Dying, hurts like dying. 
 Need me? Heart rate is 176. 
 He's in AFib with RVR. 
 All right, let's get 20 of diltiazem. 
 Let's get a liter of normal saline and give four of ondansetron. 
 Deep breaths. 
 That's better. Okay, let's get him to CT, see what's going on. I don't know what happened, We were sitting here the whole time. 
 Except for when I went to the... 
 Open your mouth. 
 You ate a death cookie. 
 Jonesy knows he's allergic to gluten. 
 Yeah, he also knows that eating it helps him stay on his stupid horse. 
 Uh, the truth is, I had a cookie. 
 Hmm. 
 Three cookies. 
 So you eat gluten, flares up your celiac, and the aftereffects keep the weight off. 
 Hmm.- Well, look, it's harder to keep the weight off at my age. 
 If I get too heavy for Fat Charlie, then... 
 You won't be able to ride anymore. 
 Not professionally. 
 Except when celiac is flared, it stops your body from absorbing nutrients like it should. 
 That is why your arm broke so easily. 
 We met at the track. 
 You fell in love with a jockey. 
 If I'm not riding anymore, who are we? 
 Honey. 
 Sure, the riding crop and the cute little pants and the helmet were what did it for me at first. 
 But then, when I fell in love, I fell in love with you. 
 Dude. 
 You've got someone who loves you. 
 Don't ruin that for something that doesn't make sense anymore. 
 It's time to hang up the saddle, Jonesy. 
 You don't have to retire the whip, though. 
 Mama has needs. 
 I'm out. 
 Meredith, glasses. Jessica. 
 Dr. Bell. How's your back doing? 
 I'm all right, thanks. 
 We have to figure out what happened to Cain's poker prize. 
 Aren't you worried about angering the great Dr. Cain? 
 I'm the CEO, so, frankly, no. 
 I'm here to help. 
 You figure out what happened? 
 Retropharyngeal hematoma. 
 Compressed his airway. 
 Well. 
 What have we got here? 
 One of the manufacturer's discs was defective. It happens. 
 Certainly. But it's more likely with each disc that's inserted. 
 Taking these out, gonna put 'em back. 
 Okay, let's-let's start with this one. 
 She seems nice from here. 
 Is this normal for Lacy? 
 No. She's been doing harder puzzles for years. 
 Here, let me have it. 
 It's okay. 
 Have you ever seen a cow? I saw a baby deer. 
 Where? I think she means at camp. 
 Our church took the kids in July. 
 To North Carolina, in the mountains. 
 Lacy brought books. 
 Picture books. She was... 
 She was good then. She was reading. 
 She came back like this? 
 No, she was fine when she got back. 
 She had a flu. It was rough. 
 A flu. How long after her return? 
 Couple of weeks. Had to miss the first day of school. 
 The mountains of North Carolinain July, that is tick season. 
 Lyme disease. 
 But she doesn't have a rash. 
 Sometimes it doesn't show up. 
 Sometimes it's hidden under the hair. 
 Lacy, have your bones been hurting? 
 Lyme is known as "The Great Imitator." 
 It can mimic virtually any disease. 
 Untreated, it can also cause neurological symptoms. 
 That could be the source of the cognitive decline you're seeing. 
 But don't worry, it is treat able if diagnosed this early. 
 We'll run a test to confirm, but if this is Lyme, I am quite certain we can get Lacy back to herself in no time. 
 You hear that, baby? 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 There you are. 
 Whoa. Is this a surprise date night? 
 Going to a shareholder meeting. 
 This is a Marshall thing. 
 He knows the CEO of this kidney dialysis company in D.C. 
 They handle 50% of the renal patients in the U.S. 
 We're hoping they're gonna letus take a look at their database for hemopleatin patients. 
 You are a rock star. 
 Who kind of looks like a spy. 
 Good luck. Let me know how it goes. 
 Maybe think about wearing that suit to our next date night. 
 Can't keep a fireman from the fire. 
 I was gonna call you. 
 Dr. Okafor and I agree that you saved that little girl from a lifetime of preventable disabilities. 
 I'm glad I could help. 
 You are a good doctor. 
 You don't think I loved you enough or wanted you enough, but how could I? I... 
 I didn't know what your adoptive family had named you. 
 The records were sealed back then. 
 So... every time a little boy came into my office, if he was the right age... 
 ...and had the right color of skin, I looked for you in his eyes. 
 I... 
 I never stopped looking. 
 Well, now you can. 
 Would it be moving too fast if I invited you to Thanksgiving? 
 Um... 
 I spend Thanksgiving with my family. 
 The one that raised me. 
 I understand that. 
 But maybe there's something we can work out. 
 No promises, but... 
 Understood. 
 Even if this doesn't work, what you are doing is above and beyond, so... thank you. 
 Well, it's the annual meeting of one of the top two dialysis companies in the country, so... it'll be a blast, right? 
 Not exactly, but, hey, if they'll give us the data on hemopleatin, it'll be well worth it. 
 How many of these things have you been to in your life? 
 Hundreds. 
 Okay. What's the plan? 
 Try to stay awake through the financials. 
 You'll see. It's so boring, half the people fall asleep. 
 When the speeches are over, we'll find the CEO, Jim DeLoach, and we'll go from there. 
 Shareholders of DiaCure, I present to you our CEO and the man behind the miracle, Jim DeLoach! 
 # Here we go!# 
 # No# 
 # No way# 
 # No one# 
 # Gonna# 
 # Stop now, go!# 
 # Save the complaints# 
 # For a party# 
 # Conversation# 
 # The world is loaded...# 
 Well, this is new. 
 # It's lit to pop and nobody ain't gonna stop# 
 # No# 
 # One.# 
 All right. All right, all right! 
 The moment you've all been waiting for is now. - Yeah! 
 The DiaCure financial release! 
 Goliath. 
 Hey! 
 And this year, DiaCure's pretax operating profit was... 
 $1.2 billion! 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
 So, this is our big data guy. 
 Welcome to corporate health care. 
 # Love teachers# 
 # It's lit to pop and nobody ain't gonna stop. 
 Success. 
 You saved Horace Dudley's life and his ability to walk. 
 Not that we should have had to do that surgery. 
 That man had four hockey pucks shoved in his spine. 
 Is that what you'll tell the board? 
 Cain is not one of the good guys. 
 But if I go to war with him and lose, I won't be here to fix his mistakes. 
 I agree completely. 
 You won't be able to save the Horace Dudleys of the world. 
 So I'm not giving up. 
 I promise you I'm not. 
 I'm just gonna have to fight in a different way. 
 Dr. Cain. 
 I owe you an explanation. 
 I assume it's about how you took my patient into the OR without my permission. 
 You were wrong to perform that operation. 
 I've heard enough. I'm filing a complaint with the board. 
 No, wait, please. Uh, what I mean is, I believeyou were wrong. 
 That doesn't make it so. 
 We both have different approaches to patient care. 
 We just do. 
 I can't fault you for leaning into Red Rock's mandate. 
 You also can't fault me for doing things the way I've always done them. 
 So maybe there's a way we can keep an eye on each other's surgical practices... 
 ...while making an extraordinary amount of money along the way. 
 What'd you have in mind? 
 A joint venture. 
 An ortho-spine surgery center for comprehensive spine care. 
 To include neuro and ortho surgery and physical therapy. 
 Both quality and quantity of patients. 
 Agreed. 
 Thanks, Jules. Mr. DeLoach, this man says that he knows you. 
 "Winnie the Winner" Winthrop. 
 How you been? Fantastic. 
 You the son? Look just like your old man. 
 Conrad Hawkins. 
 Dr. Conrad Hawkins, Chastain Park in Atlanta. 
 No kidding. That's amazing. 
 So what are you doing here? 
 Been way too long since the Old Green. 
 Was a private gentlemen's club in D.C. 
 It's a hell of a thing you've got here. 
 A falcon? 
 Yeah. Always loved the birds. 
 So, you kids want a drink? 
 Actually, we need help with something. 
 Anything for the old Winnie. 
 Your database. We're doing a little research on a drug. 
 Bigger the sample size, more accurate the data will be. 
 No problem. It's all yours. 
 That's-that's great. That's a big help. 
 Just need a little something from you fellas. 
 Little QPQ. 
 I've had my eye on Chastain for a while. 
 Big market, lot of promise. 
 An exclusive with DiaCure renal services would help us all out. 
 Think you can make that happen? 
 Okay. 
 So, five seconds of action, and then I'm on the road. 
 Usually, it's at least ten seconds. 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. 
 Okay. That's it? 
 Five seconds are up. 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 Next time, don't waste it, or else I'll have to punish you. 
 Ooh, a consequence? Mm-hmm. 
 Bring it. 
 Think he'll be back to the ER? 
 My guess is, he's done with horses. 
 Yeah, the next time we see him, it'll be for a s*x injury. 
 He gets it. 
 So do I. 
 Stupid to question the love of your life for something that's just... stupid. 
 So Jessica is the love of your life. 
 Nicely done, man.
