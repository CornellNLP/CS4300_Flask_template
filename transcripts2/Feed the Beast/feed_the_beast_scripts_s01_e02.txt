 Announcer : Previously on AMC's "Feed the Beast..." 
 You try and skip town again, these two will die. 
 No! 
 (SCREAMING) 
 The tooth fairy is my white whale, Our dream was to open a restaurant right here. Tommy : I told you, I'm not doing a restaurant without Rie. Wake up. This isn't about you. This is about your son. No, we're broke. Where would we even get the money? The real money is in filling that need even when it don't need filling. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) (SIZZLING) So, it could be a robot with wheels on it. And it could go, like, anywhere in the house. And how does it get around the house? There's a remote. Genius. I'm calling Starbucks right away. I'm serious. We can make, like, a million dollars. If we... (LAUGHS) You have something there. What? Teej, you ready? Had breakfast? Well, it doesn't matter. W-We got to go. Come on. Backpack. Hey, yo, Tommy. Come on, bud. Come on. W-Wait! You're gonna talk to your dad this morning, right? Late for school! About investing! Tommy, investing! (DOOR CLOSES) (ENGINE STARTS) How many cases can I put you down for for this remarkable Pinot grigio? I still have a couple of cases. I got what I need. I'm good. Really? 'Cause a couple of days ago, if memory serves, um, you were... You were into my Sonoma Chard. Actually, I only bought four cases. It was a Merlot. So I'm good. (DOOR OPENS) (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) (HORNS HONKING, SIREN WAILING) (ENGINE STARTS) What if he don't come out? He will, and it's "doesn't." (KNOCKING ON GLASS) (SNIFFS) Gentleman. So... the restaurant...? Is moving forward. I just lined up an investor. In a week you'll have a signed contract in your hands. I'll need to see this alleged contact from this alleged investor in 48 hours. C-Come on, man... 48 hours? That's a little tight, don't you think? You still have nine fingers, Dion, and all those pretty teeth. (CELLPHONE RINGS) Hello? Is this Tommy? Yeah. Who is this? This is Pilar from grief group. I mean, from many places, but, in your case, you mostly know me from grief group. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Uh, hey, Pilar. Hi, Tommy. Uh, listen. Um, I'm sorry to bother you, and I'll be quick. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Uh, remember how I said my sister has this restaurant? Well, we both kind of have it. Anyways, um, you know, we're always looking for wines that are, you know, unique. Unique's good. So, I-I was wondering if maybe you could recommend some unique wines? Yeah, okay. I'll... I'll come up with some ideas for the next meeting. Or I could stop by? I mean, to your place? Ah... honestly my place is kind of a mess. I'm at the old Kramer Piano Factory and we're kind of in the middle of renovations. It's really more... (CELLPHONE BEEPS) Uh... Pilar, sorry. I'm, uh, I'm getting another call from my boss. Okay. Bye. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Uh, someone's in here. Are you the kid who doesn't talk? Dumb question. Your mom got killed, huh? Are you gonna at least tell me your name? Dude! Cool. (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) You can keep the marker. Bye. (HORNS HONKING) Frank. Frank! Hey. What's with the cryptic phone call? Am I getting a promotion? Walk with me. Tommy, you got a nose for wines like nobody else. Okay. But your nose for selling wines... Come on, Frank. No one can sell in the territories you got me in. It's not about the territories, Tommy. It is about the salesman. Now I am getting complaints. You're mixing up your wines. You're not following through. You're backing into a construction barrier? But that (SCOFFS) I mean, the thing jumped out at me. I swear. Okay. So, what? W-Where's this going? If this keeps up, I'm gonna have to let you go. You know what, let me save you the trouble. All right? I've had enough. Of? This! Selling wine in bulk to people who don't know a goddamn Syrah from a Sauterne. I don't need this. You know, a friend and I... We're opening up a restaurant in Morrisania, and it's gonna kill. You're opening a restaurant in the Bronx? Yeah. That's right. Okay. Well, once you quit, you can't un-quit. You got that? Yeah.

I'll ask him some other time. H-Hey! What are you doing? Look, I'm not waiting around for you to grow a pair. Best way to deal with cold water, bro... Jump right in. Hmm? Come on, I'll come with as backup. (ENGINE STARTS) Get in the car. (ENGINE REVS) (LAUGHS) Oh, that's... that's funny. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look. I'm just playing around. Just get in. Whoa! (LAUGHS) Look, the car's got a mind of its own, man. I can't stop it! I swear to God, you move one more time... I... Come on, get in. Ooh, no. (ENGINE REVS) (LAUGHS) I missed you. I missed you, too. No. I've really missed you. How old are we? (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) Word in the walls is the Asians are expecting a boat-load of merch. I hadn't heard that. Must be hard to get solid info with all the limitations of total freedom. Those Hmong are getting big-balled, moving in on us. Don't worry. Dad, I sent them a very clear message. (SCREAMING, CRACKING) (GROANING) That merch will still land. What have you done about the Greek who burned down our restaurant? All over it. (SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE) (IMITATES GUNSHOT) He owes us 600 grand. Can't get money out of a dead man. No. But you can send a message that actually means something. (SLAMS PHONE) (FOG HORN BLOWS) You're giving him this opportunity, remember that. All right? You are a rock star sommelier who I've seen sell a $500 bottle of wine to a table full of bridge and tunnel cretins. I mean, you got this. Would you relax? Come on, you're making me nervous. Just loosen up. Loosen up. That's it. That's it. That's it. Loosen up. You haven't aged well. Yeah, well, losing a wife can do that to you. I got meetings up the ass. What's this offer? Well, um... Dion and I have... Well, actually it was Dion, Rie, and me... We, uh, we've always wanted our own place, a restaurant. We'd name it, um, Thirio. Yeah, um, it means, um... It means "beast." It means "beast." Right. And we, uh, just wanted to off... Offer, uh... I mean, we need someone... Yeah, you know what? Do you mind if I... Please. Your friend here's about to wet himself. Mr. Moran, you're a brilliant businessman. Years ago, you... You saw there was a ton of money to be made in scaffolding. Well, we're offering you the opportunity to look at it again, to recognize that the Bronx is New York's last frontier, ready for prospectors to dive right in and strike gold. How? What's the one thing everyone says the Bronx doesn't have? White people. (SCOFFS) Right. White people, and, uh, and restaurants. And the first guy puts his money into a high-end place with great food and a kickass wine list, now that guy... That guy is gonna retire on his own private island. You know what I mean? What kind of food we talkin'? Basically Ot-Hellenic. The hell is that? Yeah. You know what? It's a fair question. It's a fair question. So why don't we do a tasting? You come by tonight, and we'll prepare some samples of the food and wine that we have in mind. 6:00. All right. All right. (SNAPS FINGER) (TRUCK REVS, HORN HONKS) Plat de veau. That's French. We're doing Greek. I'll do it Greek! Grilled kebabs with lemon and sage. No. No sweetbreads, all right? I do Châteauneuf with sweetbreads, and all I've got is some '08 on its last legs. All right. All right. All right. Quail... with roasted grapes, herb-crusted rack of lamb with caramelized fennel, finished with a red wine reduction. Keep it simple, okay? It's my dad for Christ's sakes. He's got to taste the food under the fancy. All right, fine! We'll do a simple, freaking seared scallop then... with skordalia and parsley oil. Okay. Yeah. Yeah? Yes! I've been dying to see how the new Assyrtiko from Santorini pairs with seafood. I mean, that... That could really work. Right. Right. Dessert. Dessert... A panna cotta with figs, apricot, with a honeycomb candy. If I pair a Sauterne with that, my dad's mouth will explode. Yes! Which wouldn't be the worst thing. Yeah. There he is. There's my Tommy-boy. Yes! Hi. I'm sorry to just... I was in the neighborhood, and suddenly I said, "Oh. This is where Tommy lives." So, I... I hope I'm not interrupting. No. No, not at all. Dion, this is Pilar. Hey, how you doing? We're in a... A grief group together. Nice that you have that in common. (CHUCKLES) So, I was wondering about those, um, wine ideas. Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Yeah, I just got to, um... Oh, wait, no. Sorry. Shoot. I... I got to go pick up my son from school. So, I... Tommy, are you kidding me? Come on, dude. Chill. Stay here. I'll go pick him up. No. What are you talking about? Y-Yeah, yeah. No, no. I'll go get him. Are you sure? Yeah, I'll go! Dion. Oh! Right. And I'll get my jacket. Thanks. (DOOR CLOSES) So... you're, uh, renovating? Well, we're, uh, we're getting ready to. We're turning this place into a restaurant. A restaurant? Here? Yes. Here in the Bronx. Wow. That's so... valiente. Thank you. What's the haps, T.J.? Put it there, man. Look, your dad's kind of busy, so I'm gonna be your Uber. Okay? All right, come on, get in the car. Uh, uh, excuse me. Sir, hi. Um, I'm T.J.'s school counselor. I don't remember anyone but his dad being authorized to pick him up. I'm Dion Patras. Tommy brought me on as T.J.'s... support person. S-Support person? I'm here to try and help the boy through all of this. I'll be his ride, help him with his homework, give him someone to... To hang with while his dad's spiraling. Well, at least Tommy's reaching out for some help, right? Mm. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hey, you know that kid? I got to make a few stops, uh, before we head home, okay, champ? (GRUNTS) What, you got something wrong with your side? Let me take a look at that. Aw, Jesus, T.J. Someone hit you? Purple hat do that to you? God damn it. (BREATHES HEAVILY) Are you sure you want to handle this yourself? (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY) All right. Good man. (ENGINE STARTS) I told you those five-inch heels will mess you up. (BOTH CHUCKLE) You were supposed to be in Paris. What the hell happened? I got no family there. You're not going to want to hang out here. Tooth Fairy is upstairs. Tasha? Could you get my buddy T.J. here some snacks? Come on, T.J. (CHUCKLES) I worked out an arrangement with the Tooth Fairy. I just got to get some more cash. Tommy and I are doing a tasting. I-I got to get some more ingredients. I'm bored already. Give me a hand. Man : What do you think you're doing? You walking out on me? Get the hell back in there. I paid for this! Wait outside. (WOMAN SCREAMS) (TIRES SCREECH) (TIRES SCREECH, WOMAN SCREAMS) (CRYING) You got your money, bitch. What the hell does it matter? What is going on? Touch her again, asshole, and your brains are in Yankee Stadium! I want you and your boy out of my place. I think two dignified men can do better than to have a throwdown in a musty old whorehouse. Gave you a little extra to cover future dental work. Billy. 
 
 (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) (KNOCK ON WINDOW) I don't know what arrangement you have with that Tooth Fairy Polak, but be careful, huh? You're all I got. You got it. Thanks. (ENGINE STARTS) Oh, Teej, come here. Come here. Smell this. (SNIFFS) Let's pick a good one. All right, smell that. Ah, Mrs. Chung. Look at this. I like the look of these diver scallops. You know what, you can lay about half a dozen on for me, okay? I'll be back to pick them up. Come on, you. Hey, Eduardo. Dion. What's up, brother? Good, man. Listen, I need a four-pound rack of upstate New York lamb. And you... You got any spice? That's it? That's all I got. My dealer says the Asians are waiting on a huge shipment. Coming in any day. All right. Let's talk lamb. I got to get cooking. Teej, come on. (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Chef. The secret to cutting a zucchini, you got to cut it in half to keep it steady, okay? You don't want to lose a finger. All right. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) (WOMAN LAUGHS) (BOTH LAUGH) All right. Moderate-plus tannins. Moderate-plus to high acidity. Moderate-plus alcohol. High complexity with a long finish. Definitely Old World. Okay, babe. Keep going. I'm gonna say Italy, probably Tuscany. Brunello Di Montalcino. Right, so? Bring it home. Bring it home. That's it, come on. Come on, T, you got this. I say vintage... 2007. Gooooooal! Yes! Oh! Oh! Oh, my man! My man! You're the best! Not bad, not bad. (SNIFFS) (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) (PAN SIZZLING) Come here, come here. You hear that? That sizzle sound? Hmm? That's the pan talking to me. Now, remember, a good chef always listens to his pan. It'll tell me when the filet's ready to be turned or the chop is gonna hit medium-rare. It's a... a listening thing. You got that? All right, good man. Oh, there he is. Mr. Thomas Moran, sommelier extraordinaire. You look good, man. Great idea. Oh, let's, uh... Let's have a toast. Bringing good luck to this very special, very important thing. Are we doing this or not? Oh, sh1t, he's early. Who do I got to screw to get a meal around here? Mr. Moran. T.J., this is your grandfather. Aidan, this is Thomas Jr. So, feed me. All right. We're good. Go. The 2012 Premier Cru Chablis. Hints of oyster shell and mineral. Beautifully suited to be paired... Just pour. Abalone. Scallop. Same difference. Well, actually, you'll find... Next course, Chef. (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) For this, we recommend an earth-driven and light-bodied Pinot noir from Vosne-Romanée. The hell is this, pigeon? That is a sous vide quail with roasted grapes and a cracked wheat salad. For all I know, it's a bird you found up in your attic. Yeah, well, with all due respect... Chef. Main course, please. Right. Rack of lamb with roasted eggplant and a kalamata tapenade. As for pairing, I suggest a traditional 2001 Gran Reserva Rioja. Delicious. The food under the fancy. And to go with your dessert, a 2005 Sauternes. Honey-dipped tropical fruits with notes of vanilla bean. So, what do you think? I don't go for this candy-ass crap. You have no clue what an incredible meal you just had. What Dion's cooking... You're right. The Bronx is going to gentrify and get busy real soon, and all those brave souls are gonna need to be fed. May as well eat at your fancy restaurant... which I'd own half of. With one condition. I get to see my grandson every week. What? No. No. Uh, no, absolutely not. Can we just discuss this privately, partner? No. No. There's nothing to... Yeah, in the kitchen, now. No way. It's not happening. Come on, he's the kid's grandfather. He's also a racist prick who's never even bothered to see his own grandchild, who, by the way, is black. What? I think he's saying he wants to do it. He doesn't understand. Maybe your old man has changed. (SCOFFS) Huh? I mean, maybe... maybe this is his way of reaching out. All right, we have a deal. We'll send over a contract tomorrow. Already done. Nice, yeah. It's, uh, efficient. Yeah, we're gonna give this a once-over. We'll send you a signed copy in the morning. Hey, and thank you! (SMOOCHES, SIGHS) We got ourselves a restaurant. Living the dream, baby! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. My dad didn't get rich by playing fair, all right? We got to get someone to look that over. What do you mean? Like... Like a lawyer? It's what you do. All right. I got someone. We are so doing this! (BUZZER SOUNDS) What are you doing here? What? What, now that I'm out of prison, I can't have contact with you? Are you a known felon? (CHUCKLES) I have company. There's, uh, there's something I need to talk to you about. Which is? I need, uh... I need legal advice. Look, we're about to open up this restaurant, and the investor's given us this massive contract. Look, is there any chance you could eyeball it just to, I don't know, let us know if... I don't know, if it looks okay? You're just out of prison. You're broke. I don't work pro Bono. So, no, there is no chance. Good night. (DOOR CLOSES) Man : Marisa, you coming? Okay, Dad. Your mom slaves all afternoon over her ziti and you're letting it get cold. Come on. Can't you just give it a shot? What happened to your person? My person? My person was busy. She had company. I don't know. Anyway, besides, it's your turn. Can't you just call your little pretty friend? Pilar manages her sister's restaurant. She doesn't have time to pore over every detail of that contract. Yeah, dude, she does. Tommy, come on. Why don't you... She was in the neighborhood? No, no, no. People come to this neighborhood come to score drugs. And that Pilar chick, she wants your skinny ass. Besides, man, don't you think it's time to, you know, open your mind to the possibility of meeting a woman. Pilar, hi. This is Tommy. From, uh... the wine guy. Sorry to bother you. You're probably super busy. Kind of, but I can take a break. Great. Um, well, you remember, um... You remember how I-I told you that Dion and I were... Were, uh, opening a restaurant? Yeah. And, uh, good for you. Yeah, but the thing is the investor has just dumped this contract on us, right? And, well, you know, Dion knows food and I know wine, but neither of us knows a damn thing about the legal part of it all. Uh-huh. So, I was wondering if maybe you... You might have some time to kind of look it over. You know, tell us... Tell us if it seems okay? I'll look at your contract, yeah. Great. Um (CHUCKLES) Uh, do, um, you want to text me your e-mail? Thank you so much. No, thank you. I mean, see you later. Okay, bye. Sure you want to do this? 'Cause I can tell him you changed your mind, you know? You got... You got too much homework, or... (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) (ENGINE STARTS) Exactly why does this guy think you might be able to help him with this? Quién sabe. I mean, he's starting up a restaurant. Mm-hmm. I told him I work at one. Mm-hmm. So, I guess he just thinks I'm smart. It's possible. You are smart, mamita. You're just scattered. Look, I don't have time for this, but at a glance, I mean, there are some things in here that'll come back to bite the ass of whoever signs it. I sure wouldn't. All right. Tommy : You'll never guessed what happened. It's a funny story. We ran into my dad. Yeah. Me and T.J. You know, a total accident, but there he was, and I sort of had to introduce them. Believe it or not, they... They hit it off. T.J. said he'd like to spend some time with him, and my dad didn't seem to mind, so I guess it's like you always said. Even a crusty old racist like my father can't resist that boy's beautiful face. You were right. Again. (CLOCK TICKING) You play chess? Your father never taught you? (SIGHS) You got to pee? The bathroom's through the kitchen. (SIREN WAILS, HORNS HONKING) Hello? Tommy? Hola. Oh, hi. I was looking for... How are you? I'm good. You know, Tommy's... Tommy's not here. Okay. Um, I'll... Wait, wait, wait, is that... Is that the contract? How's it look? I mean, we all good? Well, actually, there's some issues with it. Like what? Give me an example. Well, like, it doesn't specifically say the name of the restaurant, and the location is kind of unclear. No contract is perfect, all right? You know, and a lot of these issues, they, uh... They go away over time. I just think Tommy should be aware that it's, uh, not a good contract, and you guys shouldn't sign it. Look, I get the distinct impression that you like Tommy. If so, then you probably give a sh1t about what's good for him. Guy lost his wife. Now his kid's a mute. The guy's life's been in a nose dive for, like, a year. These past few days, I've been seeing signs of the old Tommy. I mean, this whole restaurant idea's really got his... His blood pumping again, which is a good thing. If you want to bring all that crashing down, send him back into his damn rut, crush his dream... that's entirely on you. I just think he should know. (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) What are you doing in here? I didn't say you could wander around. Get in the kitchen. Jensen made you a sandwich. But it's still the same. Truck backfires, a loud clang at a construction site, and my mind, it goes back there to the boys who didn't make it out. To my friends. Thank you, Mose. Good. Uh, anybody... anybody else? Anybody else want to share? Tommy, how about you? Uh... Okay. I mean, I guess everything's pretty much the same. Mm-hmm. Actually, not really. Just felt weird not to start off that way. (LAUGHTER) Lately there's been a lot of things thrown at me. Changes. Um, and it's made me feel... Well, that's just it. It... It's made me feel. You know, the last few days, I haven't woken up depressed. It's like I'm just starting to shake off this... this fog. I think my son sees that. It's important to me that... That when he looks at me, he doesn't see zombie dad. You know, he sees... He sees his father. I'm really happy for you. Sounds like you're optimistic. Well, optimistic adjacent. (CHUCKLES) Hey, did you, uh, did you read the contract? I did. What'd you think? (SNIFFING) Hello. God! Phew! Well? Dude, the contract? Pilar says we're good. (CLAPS) I would kiss you on the mouth if it wouldn't start rumors. Where you going? Don't you want to celebrate? Just got to make a copy. It's what you do. (SMOOCHES) (DOOR CLOSES) ♪ (TIRES SCREECH) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! One thing I hate... Waiting. Cable guy, UPS, mailman, you. I can't just go to the Tooth Fairy and get him to tell me all the bad things he's ever done. It doesn't work like that. One or two would do. I have something that might interest you, though. The Asians? Getting a huge shipment of blow coming in any day. (TIRES SCREECH) God! I don't give a rat's ass about the Asians. I want that fat Polak. Ahab, remember? Huh? The white whale, remember? (GRUNTS) Get out of my car. Hey, buddy. How's it going? Why don't you head upstairs, get ready for bed, yeah? I'll be up in a minute. You're late. You don't discipline the boy. What? What do you mean? You might want to teach him some rules. Does things without asking. Free thinker like his mother. Never say anything about my wife. Hey, Teej, you left your math book on the... What's that? Hey, what is that? Hey. Where'd you get those bruises? It's really important you tell me where you got those bruises. Did that happen today? Okay, get in bed. Do your homework. Do not leave this room. (DOOR CLOSES) You son of a bitch. You hit my kid? Suppose I did. What would you do about it? You are not doing that to him, too, you mother... (GRUNTING) ♪ (GUN COCKS) I'd blow your brains out, but this is a $30,000 Persian rug. Tommy : We're done with him! I don't want anything to do with that scum-sucking son of a bitch or his goddamn dirty money! I don't care if we don't do the restaurant, all right?! We are not doing business with my father! Okay. I hear you. Something wrong? Nope. (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY) All good.
