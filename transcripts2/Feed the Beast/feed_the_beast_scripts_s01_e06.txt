 announcer : Previously, on AMC's "Feed the Beast..." 
 I will be calling child services. 
 They'll make a visit to see if this is a suitable environment for teaching. 
 (shouting) 
 Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of everything. 
 (glass shattering) 
 Do you want to be a real father You're gonna keep this in a safe place for me. And if even one flake of that coke is missing,  I'll take all your teeth. ♪ ♪ [Blues music plays] Well, you know, the Bronx is happening. Yeah, we got, uh... We got condos, an outlet mall, a Whole Foods... everything except, uh, a high-end restaurant. Yeah, there's, uh... There's a lot of opportunity here. Uh, we... we like to think of the Bronx as, uh, as the Wild West, you know, and we're the '49ers. Relax, Jets and Giants fans, I'm not talking football here. I'm... I'm talking about the original '49ers. Believe me. There's, uh... There's gold to be found amongst the rubble. And when did you first have the idea for "Theer-io"? It's, uh, Thirio. And, uh, it's a dream we've... we've had for years. Yeah, yeah, it was actually, uh, Tommy's, uh... Tommy's late wife, Rie. You know, she believed that, uh, we could keep it local and we could do it here in the Bronx. Well, whether Thirio catches on or not, give these two credit. Opening a high-end restaurant in the Bronx takes good, old-fashioned New York moxie. For Channel 12 News, I'm Mary Sue White. Great. Thanks, guys. Good job. We're good! Great job, guys. Yeah? We... We did okay? Oh, yeah [chuckling] you're a natural. Listen, if you have any photos of the restaurant as it was coming together, e-mail them over... it'll help fill out the segment. Okay. Hey, I need to talk business. Yeah, yeah, sure. Later on, yeah? Hey, dude, dude, are you all right? I'm fine. T. T! Look, I know what this is, huh? It's just butterflies. Look, it's just a soft opening, man. Dress rehearsal. Friends and family. And my father, who is neither friend nor family. Don't... Don't sweat your dad. Look, we already got him to invest. Reservations are coming in. This place is gonna be packed this weekend. [Sighs] No, wait, but tonight... It's just... it's just a dinner party. We didn't budget a hostess. Dude, dude, will you relax? Look, I'll take care of the hostess. All you got to do is e-mail the producer the photos and pick out a nice shirt, preferably from the men's rack. You don't like my blouse? [Chuckles] T. Huh, T? Come on. Take a look around. [Blues music plays] We did it. [Breathes deeply] Hmm? All right, and tonight... tonight's all about having fun, baby, huh? I want you to have fun. All right? Right, so, business. Okay, we have $15,000 of cash disbursements unaccounted for. I thought you might know where that went, since most of the money went through you. No. No, no idea. Let me take a look at that. I checked, and... and re-checked, and still... Wait, wait, wait. What perfume is that? Lavender Essence. Is it too much? Oh, God, no, no. No, it's perfect. Hey, you know what? Would you mind stepping in as hostess tonight? Yeah, no, look, sorry, look, I know it's a lot to ask. You've already done so much, but welcoming... we really want the first face people see when they come through the door to be, um... to be... to be welcoming, you know? And, well, you're beautiful. Uh, sure. Yeah. I can do that. That would be great. You'll be amazing. Wait, I still need to know where the money went. The wine. Yeah, of course. It all went to the wine. Uh, the receipts? Look, we are eight hours away. Can this wait? As long as you don't mind paying your kitchen staff Nada next week. [Blues music plays] Aidan won't give us the next installment if he doesn't have receipts by end of business today. Hey, Pop. It's me. I took care of the chink who did this to you. Gekko : Hey, boss. Meeting with Chu has been set. Zhangzhou Garden on Inwood Avenue. That's not exactly neutral territory. Bring backup. [Monitor beeping steadily] And, uh, what name you want on this one? Uh, I don't know, man. Uh, when I worked at Octavio's, we used to order from, uh, a place called Ronaldo's Wine Shop on 164th. Try that. [Printer whirs] Hey, uh, well, thanks for doing this, huh? Eh, what is family for, if not to commit fraud, huh? Hey, you know, I, uh... I... I got my lawyer pregnant. What? You couldn't just pay the guy? No, man. She... She... She wants to keep it. I know. [Exhales sharply] I'm an idiot. [Sighs] Look, I'm not really a family man, so when you lost your parents, I thought you were going to be a burden, you know, to watch over you, but... you're the closest to a son I'll ever get. And so, as sort of a father, I would say... it's not the worst, you know, to be a dad. [Soft guitar music plays] [Chuckles] Thanks, man. All right. I'll... I'll see you tonight. [Sighs] Oh. Don't forget to bring the girls. [Chuckles] [Oven door squeaks] So [grunts] when you slow-roast it, skin separates from the flesh and creates a crispy coating that steams the meat, making it unbelievably tender. Dion : God, you look beautiful. I'm... I'm talking to the pig. [Laughs] I know. Would you just... Good, 'cause you look hideous. Would you just shut up, okay? This is my cooking video. You do your own cooking video. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Already a diva. Oh, watch out, Rachael Ray. I'm about to beat you with that camera, trust me. Oh, good, I'll have it on tape. With this cake. Shut up! [Laughs] [Bittersweet music plays] [Mid-tempo music plays] [Bleating] ♪ Fever dream ♪ 
♪ Or so it seems ♪ 
♪ All I see is ♪ 
♪ What used to be ♪ 
♪ Fever dreams ♪ 
♪ I've been around, I'm lost and found ♪ 
♪ I burned it all to the ground ♪ 
♪ Ashes to ashes, hope that dashes ♪ 
♪ My own new mystery ♪ 
♪ And all I see is what I used to be ♪ [Engine hums] What do you want? I came to apologize. Look, I know I wasn't exactly... ecstatic when you told me. I didn't expect anything more from you. Look, I know when I wear my "World's Greatest Dad" hat, no one's gonna miss the irony. But come on, you just told me. You know what, I had my reaction. Look, were you overjoyed the moment you found out? [Crying] Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! I was fine. [Sighs] But I know who you are. It's my decision. I absolve you of all responsibility, okay? What if I don't want to be absolved? Hey, you know, we're having a private opening of the restaurant tonight. Come on, you want to come? Whatever you're serving, I doubt it can satisfy my pregnancy cravings for chocolate pudding and potato chips. All right, I'll see you there. We are not dating, okay? Eventually, maybe we can figure out some kind of parenting role, if you actually want one. But just focus on your restaurant and... [Cellphone dings] Sorry. Wait, I-I got a kitchen crisis. I rest my case. Guys, what's going on? We have no fire. What do you mean we got no fire? No hot water, either. No, no, no, no. This is not happening. Already calling. Hi. This is Pilar Herrera over at 135 Trinity... Hey, hey, hey, give me that. Give me that. Hello, yeah, this is an emergency. Yeah, well, well, we got no gas. I-I don't know. What's the name on the account? Well, Pilar set it up. Why don't you let her handle it? Yes. So... Oh, 5218. Yes. But I set up automatic payment. I mean, I'm almost positive. [Sighs] You got to be kidding me. Look, in all my years in the kitchen, I never s... Dion, stop. Tomorrow?! No, no. We need... Just tell them we have a gas leak. Uh, what I mean is, we have no gas because there's a leak. Do we smell anything? Yes! Yes. The whole place  reeks  of gas. The fumes are... Great. Thank you. Yes? He'll be right here. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. W-What kind of manager doesn't pay a gas bill?! Okay, all right, lay off. All right? It's an honest mistake. Yeah, well, mistakes don't cook my food, Tommy. You know, without her, all of this... not happening. Okay, so why don't you go bitch at someone else? All right, great. Great, and all this will fix itself, huh? Thanks for that. [Sighs] I'm so sorry. Pilar, look at me. Hot food... totally overrated. [Chuckles] Listen, you've been incredible, okay? Thank you. I'm gonna go calm him down. Girl, why don't you just jump his bones already? Tommy? You think he'd...? All : Yes. Maybe show a little more cleavage. [Slurping] [Utensil clangs] If this meal is your version of an apology, it doesn't suffice. Apology? That is not going to happen. [Guns cock] We have both endured attacks. Do I have to remind you who first? Your father's still alive. Not so for my nephew. If this continues, we will have war. Neither of us wants that. So, you will give us back our cocaine. What cocaine? Your father would have known better. You know, a country's cuisine says a lot about its people. Chinese food, for instance... greasy, fatty, fried, drowned in cloying sauces, trying to hide the fact it's just dog meat. Instead of asking me for cocaine, which I don't have, you should be thinking of ways to make me forgive you for ordering a hit on my father. Start by relocating to Jersey, and get the hell out of the Bronx. Move all the product. I thought you had a gas leak. I may have been unclear on the phone. Who cares if there's a leak or not? We're very sorry about that, okay, but we're opening a restaurant tonight. Is there anything you can do to please turn the gas back on? Okay, this... this is an emergency. No, actually, it's not. And meanwhile, I've been pulled away from potential  real  emergencies. Listen, buddy [scoffs] how quickly can it be done if we, uh, you know, pay a little extra? Extra? Yeah, I always like my chocolate mousse with a raspberry coulis and a dollop of whipped cream, you know what I'm saying? Is that chef-speak for a bribe? Think of it as an incentive to help a business in the Bronx, hmm? This  is what's wrong with this city. Culture of deceit. Oh, my God, just... just turn on the damn gas, would you?! Dion, Dion, okay, just tell us, how soon can we get it fixed? The technician will be out tomorrow sometime between 8:00 and 8:00. [Scoffs] There's your dollop of whipped cream, buddy. Yeah, very funny. Come on, Terry. Very funny. Come on. Unreal! Yeah, the one honest guy in the Bronx! Geez. See, that's what happens when you always think you can bend the rules. Oh, so now it's my fault that Pilar can't pay a bill. No, man, no. Nothing's ever your fault. [Sighs] T, T, what is wrong with you today? Man, you need to get over it. [Blues music plays] Look, here are your damn receipts. [Mid-tempo music plays] Now, wait. You're not gonna blow us up, are you, Mose? I'm not sure, man. [Squeaking] [Panting softly] [Rock music plays] [Cheering and laughing] We have fire! [Cheering continues] [Both laugh] Whoo! Oh! Yes! Yes! All right, come on. We got to make up for lost time. Habib, don't stop. Come on, keep whisking. Got it, Chef. Hey, Chef. I want that lamb more tender than my heart when I'm in your arms. You were never that tender, Chef. You know I was. [Mutters] No, seriously, you know I was. Val, Val, thinner, finer. It's looking good, though. Yes, Chef. Let me see that knife. Come on, let me see it. All right, you know, a good knife can last your whole life. Your mom taught me that. You know, her knives were always immaculate. Go ahead, try that. Go on. Let's go. Let's go! We got two hours till game time, people! Come on! Yes, Chef! Yes, Chef! [Sighs] [Soft guitar music plays] [Exhales sharply] [Sighs] [Guitar music continues] [Snorting] [Sniffing] [Sighs] With a fish this fresh, the key is to do as little as possible. So, a little oil in a cast-iron pan. Dion, the food is down here. Oh, sorry. Believe me, you are more photogenic than catfish. [Chuckling] Oh, really? [Chuckles] Dion, down! All right. All right. Let's make this fish, okay? [Laughs] [Footsteps approach Hey. What's going on? Um, I got you an opening-night present. I mean, even though... opening night is actually tomorrow. But... here. [Chuckles] What? You didn't have to do that. Wow. That's very thoughtful of you. Thank you. I wanted you to know how much I love working here. No, I know. It's been... It's been great. Uh, let me fix that. [Chuckles] Oh. Thanks. I'm so excited about tonight. Yeah. All this work, and... here we are. [Chuckles] [Chuckles] It's been amazing getting to know you. I mean, it's crazy. It's only been a few weeks, but I feel like I... We're, you know... [Footsteps approach] Hey, buddy. Uh... oh! Right. The art store. Oh, um, you know what, can we... can we go tomorrow? No, no, no, that... that's okay. That's okay. Um, we'll... We'll make it quick. Um... [Laptop closes] Uh, okay, let's go. Uh, hey, um... thanks again. That's very sweet of you. 
 
 [Soft guitar music plays] Uh, Pilar, I was wondering... I'm happy to work tonight as a waiter, but do you think at some point, I can have a job in... in the kitchen? Why are you asking me? I'm not the owner. I'm just the manager. Yeah, right. Uh, sorry to interrupt. Ah, Ronaldo's Wine Shop. You know, one of my brothers from my squad got a job there when he got back, before it closed down. Closed down? Yeah, last year. Are you sure we're talking about the same place? Yeah. Ronaldo's Wine Shop over on, uh, 164th. [Speaks Spanish angrily] [Rapid footsteps approach] These are fake! You gave me fake receipts?! What? Wow, you know, you... you look amazing. You gave me all this crap about one accounting error, but this... this is illegal. All right, Pilar, listen to me, all right, opening a restaurant... it's not easy. Now, if you don't cut some corners, you're never gonna make it. Look, if this fails, poor Tommy's gonna fall back... This is not about Tommy! Don't pretend it's about Tommy! You know what, you're not exactly the most competent manager I've ever worked with. Yeah, if you're not careful, I could always... What, you're gonna run me off for calling you on your sh1t? I could take these right now to Aidan, and when he finds out you're cheating... Aidan wrote the book on cheating. Oh, then I guess he'll admire your handiwork. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on, no one's gonna go to Aidan. No? Why not? What's wrong, Dion? Cat got your tongue? No clever comebacks? [Breathing heavily] [Mid-tempo blues music plays] [Grunting] [Rattling] [Gasping] [Soft guitar music plays] Okay, go get ready for tonight, okay, buddy? [Hopeful, bittersweet music plays] [Scoffs] [Chatter, light laughter] Dion : Service! Ten plates, table one. Come on, get them out of here. Push, man. Keep up with me. Keep up with me. Be careful I don't pass you. Tommy : Moschofilero, from Mantinia, Greece. Light body, aromatic, and floral, this wine complements the savory components of the dish while allowing the citrus to shine. [Laughter] Hey, ladies, don't say I never take you any place, huh? [Laughs] Cheers! Welcome to Thirio. A pleasure to have you with us tonight. Right this way. Okay, Val! Quick, quick! Coming, Chef! You got the... Okay, Chef. Real good. Dion : That's what I want to hear. Service! I'm telling you, Neil, you should tear down the whole waterfront, stack it with luxury high rises. Not that that's my business. No, it just generates business for you. [Chuckles] Tell me what you think of the food tonight. The location works, but I'm not settled on the chef. Hey. Why so stingy with the bread? And, what, no butter? I'll get your waiter. You feeling okay, Aidan? Yeah. I'm fine. Six more plates coming out! Come on, VIP table. Tommy : I have for you a Manzanilla sherry from Spain. It's a match made in heaven for the grilled sheep's-milk cheese in front of you. See this guy? What, the old guy? Every fourth Tuesday of the month. No. Excuse me. Enough makeup on those women? Oh, my gosh, they look like whores. Dion : Hey, let's keep pushing! Dude, don't drown them. Val, you're looking after my babies. Val : Like they were my own, Chef. Come here, kid. The image you present to the world is important, especially for you. How's the hand? Good. Dion : Come on, let's go! [Speaks indistinctly] Beautiful, man. Me or the cockles, Chef? Don't make me answer that. I didn't think you were gonna come. I got hungry. Hey, Mose! Get this lady a table, huh? Yeah, Chef. [Mid-temp Mediterranean music plays] Thank you. Hi, there. How you doing? I'm... feeling good. Happy. Hmm. I didn't know you were coming tonight. Well, I didn't plan to, but I... I guess I'm thinking about letting Dion into my life a little more than I expected. Chocolate pudding and potato chips. Compliments of the chef. Oh, my God, what am I doing? He would be a terrible father. He's into drugs. He's into girls. Is he dating anyone? I... don't know. Yeah. Doesn't matter. But just, since I'm curious, will you let me know if you see him with any other women? Sure. Yeah. [Mid-tempo Mediterranean music plays] Come here. Check it out. [Crying] There it is. There it is. Dion, Gloria cries at everything. [Cries] She's a crier. All right, whatever. Look, our targeted clientele is your dad's table. [Laughter] Just I-I can't read him. They're all a bunch of poker faces. Hmm. What do you think, huh? And that guy? Maybe he just doesn't like lamb, okay? Don't worry, all right? I think we'll... Who's that? [Chatter] Hi. Can I help you? Are you Thomas Moran? Yes. Nancy Hansen. Child Protective Services. What? Please, please, come over here. Jesus, now? I'm in the middle of running a restaurant here. Sorry, but, uh, we don't call ahead. Well... Is that T.J.? Working? No, he's not working. Um, this is... this is a private dinner party, you know, just friends. It's... It's kind of fun for him, you know, to, uh... [Laughter] The darker the cherry, the sweeter the berry, baby! [Laughter] And who are those women? They're close family friends. Um, you know, we live in the apartment upstairs, actually. Mm, right. Well, um, I'm going to need to see that it's a suitable home environment. As opposed to what? Let's just see the home. Right. Teej. Teej, come here. Please. Right this way. Come on. Sorry, what... what was your name again? I'm Nancy. This is T.J. So, T.J., I just want to ask you a few questions. He... He doesn't speak. He hasn't spoken since his mom died a year ago. I mean, that... that's... that's why you're here, right? I mean, it was obviously very traumatic. [Panting] Tommy, what's going on? I got people waiting for wine downstairs. I'm kind of busy here. Yeah, well, so am I. Look, is this gonna take long? You are...? In the middle of serving a room full of people. And who the hell are you? She's from Child Protective Services. Well, can you tell her to come back later? No, I cannot tell her to come back later. Would you... I'm Dion Patras. Tommy's best friend. Dion. Look, I was here when T.J. was born. I'm telling you, he's a great kid. He's just going through a rough patch right now, right, champ? Okay, Dion. Okay, I'm gonna ask both of you to wait downstairs. Absolutely. Anything we can do to help. Please. Okay. Come on. Come on. What are you mad at me for? Huh? Look, I'm just telling her. Your name. You have a record. You know that, right? It's like you forget, don't you? You do something, and then, pfft, it's out of your head forever, like it never happened. [Sighs] [Chatter] Okay. Hey, Tommy, Tommy, would you pour some more wine? You're making me nervous. What is taking her so long? Nancy : Mr. Moran? Yes? Hey. Hey. How'd it go? I, uh, have a couple of questions for you now. Of course, yes. Ask away. What's going on? Nothing. I'll be right with you. So, how's T.J. dealing with all the disruption of starting a restaurant in his residence? Oh, uh, it's not been a problem at all. He's... He's okay with it. Okay? He's more than okay. You're looking at three generations here. Ever since T.J.'s mom died, I've been taking care of my grandson when Tommy's been busy with work. You can't find a more supportive family. Hmm. Well, I'm gonna let you get back to it. Great. Thank you. Um, I'm glad this worked out. Well, this was just the first visit. There's gonna be at least one more unannounced spot check. Nice meeting you, T.J. I didn't do it for you. I did it for my investment. Bring some more damn wine. [Glass clinking] Man : Hey, chef! Chef, get in here! Don't be shy. Come on! Don't be shy! Chef! Hey, come on, chef! Yeah, come on, hey! [Cheers and applause] [Shushing] This was the best meal I've had since... Well, since the last time my mother cooked for me. Aww. May God rest her soul. Bravo, Chef Patras! [Cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you, really. Thank you. Guys, come on. Come over here. Come on. [Cheers and applause] I can't take all the credit. Forget it! Oh! [Cheers and applause] Yes! Did we rock it? Did we rock it or what? Whoo! Yeah, we all got a shaky start. Come on, but we clicked. Ah, we caught fire! Who heard the lamb made a woman cry? No, no, no, I heard it made three people cry, huh? Mm-hmm. Tommy. Proud of you, man. Proud of you. I love you. Where is your glass? Uh, not drinking. Want to be 100% for tomorrow night. [Man laughs] But I'll get you lushes some more champagne. Yeah, you will. Yeah! Hey, let's get a shout-out for Mose, our gas whisperer. Yes, Mose! Ohh! Hey. Where are you going? They're, uh... They're all up on the roof. You should stay and celebrate. [Sighs] We got a big day tomorrow. I'm beat. Well... Thank you for everything. Tonight would not have been possible without you. Good night, Tommy. [Soft music plays] Dion : Mmm! [Chuckling] Oh, my God. You're a genius. That is the single-most amazing pistachio cream-crusted cake I have tasted in my life. Stop it. Oh, I'm serious. Is it really that good? Got to get you a good bit. Okay. It's better than good. I'm telling you, man. Don't. Don't what? I'm telling you the Japanese girl from your uncle's table likes me. You give her 100 bucks, she'll do more than like you. Okay, I got 100 bucks. [Speaks indistinctly] You didn't invite your old boss to friends and family for your new restaurant? Hello, Fiasco. Hello. Habib. Hi, Patrick. Chef, a word, please. [Sniffs] It's cool, it's cool. My product... I need it back. [Sighs uneasily] Don't worry about it. It's well-hidden. I should hope so. Go get it for me now. Right. I don't have access to it tonight. Look, but it's... it's in a secure place, I promise. Look, I-I-I'll get it. It's not a problem. I'll have it for you, I swear to God. Why do I trust you? Tomorrow. Thomas. [Chatter, light laughter] What was that? You're friends with Patrick Woijchik now? No. He just wanted to wish me luck on our new venture. Was he being ironic? I mean, you burned down his restaurant. I already apologized about all that when I got out of prison. He was... He was cool about it. Huh. That's sweet. I mean, he does seem the forgiving type. Look, dude, he... he said they got the insurance money and that they were looking to get out of the restaurant business anyways. It was a blessing in disguise. You called it. [Vehicle approaches] Hey, just... just let it go, huh? I mean, we did... we did good tonight. You know, just, uh... you know, just try and enjoy it. [Chatter in distance] [Motorcycle engines buzzing] [Silenced gunshots, glass shatters] Man : sh1t! [Tires screeching] White :  In what police believe may be a gang-related shooting occurring just after 9:00 tonight at the corner of 170th and Trinity Avenue... Hey, there's our sign. There are two confirmed dead. It certainly won't help this borough shake its reputation for violence and crime. Some have taken to calling the Bronx the Wild West. [Phone ringing] Man : Thirio. But tonight, it truly is. Yes. For Channel 12 News, I'm Mary Sue White. Another time, maybe. [Groans] Thirio. Uh, yes, your party of four. Okay, um, would you like to reschedule for another night? [Phone ringing] Hold on one moment, please. Thirio. Okay. Um, okay, maybe, uh, another time. [Phone ringing] Thirio. What are you looking at me like that? I didn't start the shooting. No? You had nothing to do with it? What, you seriously think I was invo... Why was Patrick Woijchik here? Yes, uh, sorry, hold on one moment. Can any part of you answer that without lying? [Phone ringing] [Scoffs] Thirio. Did you get rid of the coke, like I told you to? Can any part of you answer  that  without lying? All right, look, T. Don't. Don't even start. There's always something else going on with you. Look, where's all this coming from, huh? Would you like to reschedule? Look, I know you're worried about the restaurant, okay? I get it. I am, too, but, yeah, you know, all this... It's... It's gonna blow over. We're gonna be okay. [Phone ringing] I don't know about that. [Door closes] We had our soft opening last night. It was good. You would have... People enjoyed it. It's hard for me, though. I... It's like I wasn't there. You know, my... my palate was off and... [Sighs] I'm doing the best I can, but I don't know, Rie. Of the three most important people in my life, two can't talk to me, and the third, every time he opens his mouth, he lies. [Soft guitar music plays] Maybe it's good you can't talk to me. 'Cause the first thing I'd ask is... did you sleep with Dion?
