 (FOLK MUSIC PLAYS) 
 What? I'm up. What? 
 Thanks. Thanks, buddy. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Oh! Damn it. 
 Okay. All right. 
 Oka... No, you go. Go, go. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Ooh, that's right. 
 Tommy : So, after school, maybe we'll, uh... 
 We'll stop by the art store and get you a new sketchbook and, um, some of those... 
 What... what... What were those called? 
 Charcoal somethings? 
 Yeah. Worth a shot. 
 (DOOR BUZZES) 
 You know, I still had eight months. 
 You're amazing. 
 Okay. Just... 
 I didn't actually do... 
 With all due respect, I wish you'd gotten life. 
 Maybe you'll lose a few pounds, huh? 
 Hey, go change. I'll explain your parole terms. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Come here. 
 (SMOOCHES) 
 All right. 
 Be good.

 Ahh. 
 Seriously, I don't know how you did that, but thank you.

 Well, what's wrong with right now? 
 Come here. 
 Hey, Tommy! 
 Hey, guys. 
 Hey, Tommy! 
 What's up, Tommy? 
 No association with known felons. 
 No weapons, and of course (MOANS) you can't... vote! 
 (MOANS) 
 So when am I gonna see you again? 
 Well, I got to confess, I'm always getting into trouble. 
 And when I do, I know where to find a good lawyer.

 Getting by. Now, if you'd please.

 Flight is at noon tomorrow. 
 Maury Finkelberg? Really? 
 Could you have given me any less notice? 
 You're welcome. 
 Uncle, reminding you I need tomorrow night off. 
 My daughter's talent show. 
 Consider me reminded, lovely. 
 Hi, Dion. Bye, Dion. 
 Can I stay here tonight? 
 All of my rooms and all my girls are booked. 
 I'm telling you, the Bronx is the next damn Gold Rush. 
 Which is why these lotto machines are working overtime. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Come on. Get out.

 Going already? Huh? (CHUCKLES) 
 Patrick. It's not your usual time. 
 I'm looking for your nephew. 
 Dion? 
 Doesn't get out for months. 
 Find him. 
 You know, there's a couple of cops up there, maybe a judge. 
 That's not good for business, yours or mine. 
 What happens to people who lie to me? 
 Screw you, Patrick! 
 I pay your dogs every month for protection. 
 You call that protection? 
 You do know why they call me the Tooth Fairy. 
 Don't you? 
 He's not here. 
 (WINE POURING) 
 (KNOCKS) Mr. Moran, hi. 
 You missed last week's appointment. 
 Yeah, sorry. 
 Uh, work's... Work's been brutal. 
 I'll call to set something up. 
 Well, we have about 15 minutes till school lets out. 
 Come on. 
 My health insurance only covered 10 sessions with a shrink and 10 sessions with a speech therapist, but now... now it's maxed out, and it's all on me. 
 It's just a lot to juggle without his mom around. 
 I can only imagine. 
 Yeah, you can only imagine. 
 What are you thinking? 
 I'm thinking if you had 20 years more experience, what a difference that would make for T.J. 
 You are totally deflecting. 
 I am who I am. You are who you are. 
 So let's... Let's talk about what's real... 
 T.J. failing, T.J. getting into fights, T.J. not talking. I get it. 
 You have a lot on your plate as the only parent. 
 So what, now, I'm... I'm the only single parent whose kid is having trouble in school? 
 No. You're the only single parent whose son witnessed his own mother get killed in a hit-and-run and hasn't said a word since. 
 (BELL RINGS) 
 And whose father has a drinking problem. 
 I smell alcohol on your breath. 
 That's wine. 
 I'm a wine rep. That's part... 
 Yeah, Mr. Moran, if this continues to go downhill, I'm required by law to notify Child Protective Services. 
 What does that mean, exactly? 
 You could lose T.J. 
 I'm not gonna let anyone take you away. 
 (DOOR BUZZES) 
 In trouble so soon? 
 I miss you already. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Hey, uh, can I come in? 
 Ooh. (CHUCKLES) 
 Look, you're a great lay, but I think we should keep this client-attorney business strictly professional. 
 (LOCK CLICKS) 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 (HORN HONKS) 
 Good behavior? 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 My money's on, uh, good cooking. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Glad to see you. 
 You, too. 
 Are you gonna crash here? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, just for one night. 
 Got to go to Paris tomorrow. 
 Yeah, I... I got to get away. 
 That's too bad. 
 It'd be nice to have you around. 
 Yeah, I'll be back. 
 So you were in the one prison without a weight room? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Nice. 
 Don't worry, I'll still kick your ass. 
 How you doing, man? You okay? 
 T.J., you remember Dion. 
 Look at you. Huh? What's up, T-Bone? 
 All right. Come on. 
 All right. 
 Oh, you see they turned the methadone clinic into a yoga studio? 
 Yeah. Got an organic market coming in, too. 
 I know. It's crazy, right? 
 It's like I said, you know, the Bronx is the new Brooklyn. 
 Eh, it's coming up, man. 
 Yeah, well, parts of it. 
 Maid called in sick. 
 Look, how do you live like this, huh? 
 I had better things back in prison. 
 Well, I'm sure they'd make room for you again. 
 Hey, uh, is T.J. all right? You know, he seems a little... 
 Quiet? 
 Dented. 
 Dented, I'll take. It's broken I'm worried about. 
 He hasn't spoken since she died. 
 Oh, thanks for coming to the funeral, by the way. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Oh, yeah, well, uh, the county jail was all out of hall passes that day. 
 Oh, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, you're killing me. 
 You... You got a $20,000 stove, and your fridge is empty. 
 Well, there's not a lot of time for grocery shopping. 
 All stocked up on wine, though, I see, huh? 
 How are you and the bottle getting along these days? 
 Really well, actually. 
 Yeah? Yeah, no. We're... We're in love. 
 How about you and the blow? 
 We broke up. 
 'Cause it's so hard to get drugs in prison. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, thanks for coming to visit me, by the way. 
 I'm sorry. Was I not there for you? 
 That's funny, uh, 'cause the way I remember it, the one time I really needed you, you know, when my wife was killed, you got coked up and burned down the restaurant we worked at. 
 So not only did I lose my wife, I lost my best friend and my job. 
 So no, no, thank you. 
 I'm sorry about Rie. 
 I miss her, too, you know? 
 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) 
 Hey, what's up, T-bone? 
 You hungry? 
 (FOLK MUSIC PLAYS) 
 So, put it down like that. 
 (SIZZLING) 
 Ah, j-j-just... Just hold on, champ. 
 What? 
 Go on. 
 Oh, come on, man. 
 Tommy, what are you doing? The food's getting cold. 
 Uh, look, I'm really... 
 I'm really not having this with you. 
 All right, listen, the kid doesn't eat until you do it. 
 Tonight, we have, uh, our special... 
 House-made malfatti with vine-ripened Roma tomatoes, Parmesan, and basil. 
 Pairs perfectly with this 2010 Chianti Classico, an old-world Sangiovese, aged in traditional botti. 
 That's large-format barrels, neutral oak. 
 Look for dried red fruits, a medium body, and a bright, mouthwatering acidity. 
 And he's back. 
 (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY) 
 Can we eat already? 
 (SNIFFS) 
 (TRAIN SQUEALING) 
 Okay, so I'm a little out of practice cooking Italian. 
 What do you mean? 
 That meal was perfectly mediocre. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 I still want to do Greek. 
 Yeah, well, it's gonna be hard if you're moving to Paris. 
 Oh, why don't you come to Paris with me? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Seriously. 
 We could do the restaurant there. 
 Great idea. 
 Yeah, T.J.'s old enough to live here on his own. 
 Oh, no, no. T.J.'s already coming. 
 We... We just wanted to know if you wanted to come. 
 Oh, yeah? (LAUGHS) 
 You're out of your mind. 
 Seriously, though. I mean, think about it. 
 You know, you, me, Teej... 
 Three bachelors letting loose in the city of love. 
 Come on, man, we... we would have the best Greek restaurant in all of Paris. 
 I can't uproot T.J. like that. 
 He's been through enough change. 
 Seems he needs a fresh start almost as much as you do. 
 It's not that simple. 
 Besides, I-I-I can't handle that whole French scene without you. 
 Who's gonna make fun of it with me? Huh? 
 Come on, seriously. I-I-I won't survive. 
 You always survive. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 All right. 
 All right, look at that. 
 Tell me... What do you see? 
 Uh, a plate? 
 No. 
 You see black orzo in a spicy seafood broth and a celeriac puree. 
 (SNIFFS) 
 Topped with, uh, grilled octopus and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes, perfectly finished with micro bronzed fennel. 
 Mmm! 
 Classic Mediterranean, with a very specific and dare I say very personal Hellenic influence. 
 Dude, I helped you come up with this whole menu. 
 You don't have to walk me through it. 
 You know, uh, in prison, all anyone's ever thinking about is escaping. 
 You know what I was thinking about? 
 I was thinking about Thirio. 
 Who do you think you're talking to? 
 Downstairs, all I see are Rie's unfinished designs. 
 That giant espresso machine from Italy, Rie put that together herself. 
 I look up to the ceiling, I see... I see pine beams. 
 Cypress. 
 The whole... What? 
 Cypress beams. 
 It's a Mediterranean restaurant. 
 There is no pine in the Mediterranean. 
 I'm pretty sure it's pine. 
 Well, where's the "Bible"? Forget it. 
 Come on, take a look. 
 Wow. 
 It was a long time ago. 
 It was a lifetime ago. 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Uh-oh. Boom. 
 Bite me. 
 Come on, imagine it. 
 Thirio in Paris. 
 With the two of us, man, we could totally pull it off. 
 It was the three of us that were gonna pull it off. 
 I could never do it any other way. 
 First, the Chinks come in. 
 Then the Mighty Irish push them out, until the Wops and the Jews take over. 
 And, then, whoops, here come the Coloreds and the Spics and... bam... now the Vietnamese or Cambodians, whatever the hell they are. 
 So basically, it's Chink to Chink, circle of life. 
 My father, rest his soul, used to say a neighborhood is like an organism, a living thing, always changing, always needing something. 
 And a good businessman finds out what that need is and fills it. 
 No offense to my old man, but what he didn't know... 
 The real money is in filling that need even when it don't need filling. 
 Ah, come on.

 One day at a time, I guess. 
 I meant for a living. (CHUCKLES) 
 Oh, I'm a sommelier, but I'm between restaurants, so, uh, I rep wines. 
 No way. I'm in the restaurant business, too. 
 My sister has a place, La Cubana Loca, in Harlem. 
 Actually, I'm, like, the manager. 
 We're always looking for wines. 
 We should exchange numbers. 
 I kept looking at the door, thinking Rie was gonna walk in at any second, but she never did. 
 She never will.

 Now, the prep and, uh, cooking stations are... 
 They're gonna go here, here, there.

 Oh, and that lady lawyer friend of yours.
