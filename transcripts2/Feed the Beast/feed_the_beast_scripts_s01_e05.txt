 ANNOUNCER : Previously on AMC's "Feed the Beast." 
 I have an emergency! 
 My sister's unconscious. 
 I'd hate for you to have gone through all this trouble and we don't pass inspection. 
 You'll pass. 
 Maybe you've forgotten what we wanted that oven for? 
 Oh, how convenient! 
 Yet another discussion that didn't involve me! 
 (SCREAMING) 
 Don't worry, I'm gonna take care of everything. 
 (SILENCED GUNSHOT) 
 I own you! 
 I suggest you lean on TJ's support person,  Dion seems very committed. 
 Mmmm...

 Tommy : Come on, bud. 
 You got to get up, get dressed. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Yeah, I, uh, I had trouble getting out of bed, too, this morning, thinking about tomorrow. 
 You know what I was thinking? 
 I was thinking maybe we could, uh... 
 I don't know, make her something. 
 You know? Like a... Like a nice card, or even a cake. 
 We'll get through it. 
 Just like the whole year... You and me, okay? 
 (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS) 
 All right, people. 
 Mmm! 
 The clock is our bitch today, okay? 
 Let me taste that. 
 Oh, my God. I love it! 
 No, no! Not now, Chef! 
 I'm mid-whisk! You look well. 
 Hey, Habib. Come on. 
 Perfect cubes. I want perfect cubes. 
 I got your cubes right here, Chef. 
 Hey, what's the haps, T.J.? 
 Dion : Hey, dude. 
 You all right? 
 How about tomorrow, I show you how to bake a cake? 
 Hmm? 
 Have a think about it, okay? 
 Do you have a finalized menu? 
 You know, the one I asked for yesterday and the day before yesterday, and pretty much every day this week? 
 Yeah, sorry. I've been kind of busy making up for the week that that idiot chef wasted turning my restaurant into a pile of deep-fried sh1t. 
 I need to get the menu to the printer. 
 Patience, chica, all right? 
 W-What's the Spanish word for "patience?" 
 (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
 All right, but that's more than one word. 
 Tommy! Tommy. 
 For the outside sign. 
 You wouldn't believe the things people throw away. 
 Nice, Mose. 
 I have a lead on a spectacular "T." 
 Can't wait to see it. 
 Oof. 
 Such waste! 
 One of Chef Kevin's uninspired choices. 
 Good riddance. 
 Maybe some people would like it. 
 Believe me, if we serve this crap, the state will revoke our liquor license. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 What? 
 (MID-TEMPO GUITAR PLAYS) 
 Please tell me we have a liquor license. 
 Pilar. 
 I sent the application with the check. 
 I forgot to follow up. 
 It's been crazy here. 
 Okay, when did you send the check? 
 Last week. 
 Pilar, it could take months to get a liquor license! 
 We... We open in six days. 
 I'm so sorry. I feel awful. 
 (CELLPHONE VIBRATES) 
 Oh! 
 Oh, thank God. 
 (SNIFFLES) My sister woke up. 
 I... I should see her. 
 I'm so happy! 
 I mean, I still feel awful, but... 
 Oh, I know a guy in the restaurant business that might help out. 
 I-I'll make a call. 
 No. 
 You know what? Don't call anyone. 
 Don't... Don't do anything. You should go see your sister. 
 It's more important. 
 Go. 
 But the liquor license... 
 I'll handle it. Go. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Hey. We got an issue. 
 All right, guys. Guys, hold your thoughts. 
 Hold your thoughts. 
 I want to know what Mr. Moran thinks first. 
 Dion, I-I need... 
 Come on. Taste it. 
 A little bit of sauce. 
 Food. Fork. 
 Thoughts. 
 It's good. 
 What... That's it? 
 It's amazing, okay? It's erection-worthy. 
 All right, come on, man. 
 Don't... Don't tell me what you think I want to hear, all right? 
 Tell me what I need to know. 
 Look, Rie always told me what I needed to know. 
 Yeah, I need you to be that voice for me, man. 
 Here's what you need to know. 
 You need to finalize our fantastic menu so the rest of us can do our jobs, okay? 
 T. 
 T, T, T. T. 
 Hey. 
 Is this about tomorrow? 
 No. 
 Maybe. 
 Yeah. 
 Whatever you need, huh? 
 You know that, right? 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 All right. 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 It's, uh... 
 It's Rie's birthday tomorrow. 
 Anyway, look, uh, come on, man. 
 Tell me. 
 Do I need a different protein? 
 You need a different protein. 
 You need a different protein. 
 You need a different protein. 
 All right, I'm thinking. 
 I'm thinking. 
 Oh. Oh, I'm thinking... 
 What do you got? 
 I'm thinking langoustines, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Yes! 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Our agreement is I make weekly installments. 
 You'd know that if you'd read the contract. 
 I'm not cutting you a check until Monday. 
 We need you to expedite the liquor license. 
 What makes you think I can do that? 
 'Cause it's the kind of thing you do. 
 Let me understand. 
 You, Mr. By the Book, are asking me to do something unscrupulous, after hating me for living my unscrupulous life. 
 I remember when you were 16, you called me a criminal prick. 
 Well, look who needs that criminal prick now. 
 You need this, too. 
 The restaurant won't make money if we can't sell wine. 
 How do you fail to get a liquor license? 
 Isn't that the whole point of your "career?" 
 You're in over your head with this clown car you're calling a restaurant. 
 Either step up to your responsibility or stop wasting my money. 
 (COUGHS) 
 Can you get us a license or not? 
 (SNIFFLES) 
 No guarantees.

 That prison guard? 
 Taken care of. 
 Just like you taught me. 
 (SLOW-TEMPO GUITAR PLAYS) 
 Someone in our organization leaked my prison visit. 
 It's the only way the Asians could have set the hit. 
 I'll find the rat. Squash it. 
 Patrick! 
 How's your father? 
 No change. Your sister? 
 She woke up. 
 Really? She just... woke up? 
 It might happen for your father. 
 He might be back to his usual self soon. 
 God willing. 
 God willing. 
 Oh, thank you, again, for your help with the health inspection. 
 You don't by any chance know anything about liquor licenses, do you? 
 Need to speak with you, Boss. 
 Well. (CHUCKLES) 
 I hope this isn't the last time I get to see you. 
 You, too. You have my number. 
 Okay. 
 Her sister woke up. 
 Found out who tipped off the Asians. 
 You're not gonna like it. 
 Hey. Where you been? 
 At the hospital. 
 Let me guess. You need some money. 
 Just... just a scratch, all right? 
 I-I got to do some sourcing. 
 Next installment is Monday. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 T! No money till Monday? 
 Come... Come on, man. What gives? 
 It's in the contract. Read it. 
 You'll like it. 
 Lots of fun surprises in there. 
 Hey. I'm doing langoustines. 
 If you could just ask your dad to give us the installment just a little early. 
 Look, I was just at my father's to ask him to... 
 For more money, okay, and we're not gonna get it till Monday. 
 T, come on. 
 Close the door. 
 Can't you just go back and ask him? 
 The restaurant is not all about you and your whims, all right? 
 I've got other issues I'm dealing with. 
 Dude, look, we still got to work together here! 
 Dion. 
 Dion, if there's anyone who can make something out of nothing, it's you. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (CHATTER) 
 Hands are, like, impossible. 
 Easy if they're wearing mittens. 
 But your hands are awesome, T.J. 
 (CHATTER CONTINUES) 
 I Googled what happened to your mom. 
 Do you r-remember anything? 
 That's messed up. 
 Boy : Hey, Turd! 
 Mute boy. 
 You know, I think I'm gonna puke every time I look at your mural.

 Sorry to bother you. 
 Is Dion Patras here? 
 Dion went to the fish market. 
 Would you like to wait for him? 
 If you'd like to wait... 
 No, uh, just... 
 Have him call me or meet me there at 3:00. 
 Eastgate Family Clinic? 
 You do not want to go to Eastgate Family Clinic. 
 Why not? 
 I mean, is there something wrong with it? 
 Do you have another recommendation? 
 I recommend you reconsider your decision. 
 (SCOFFS) Excuse me? 
 How old are you? 
 I am none-of-your-business years old. 
 You do not want to do this. 
 Okay. 
 Look, you don't know what you're talking about. 
 Just give Dion the message, please. 
 I do know what I'm talking about. 
 Look, there's always a problem. 
 Matthew gambled away my savings, Ruben drove my RAV4 into a hotel pool. 
 I thought Diego was the one, but he ran off with a stripper. 
 Two weeks later, I found out I was... 
 So it seemed like the sensible thing to do.

 Look, I don't know about you and Dion, but I do know if you want a baby... maybe this is the baby you get.

 Yo, what's this? 
 It's the wire you're gonna wear next time you meet with the Tooth Fairy. 
 Oh, hell no. No, no, no, no, no. 
 Hey. Listen to me. Are you listening, huh? 
 I tossed your chef for you. 
 Okay? It's a two-way street, remember? 
 This is what you owe me. 
 Come on. 
 The Tooth Fairy will kill me if he catches me wearing a wire. 
 Did you not understand the term "quid pro quo?" 
 It's Latin for you're wearing a goddamn wire.

 Right. Yeah. 
 No, I, uh, I still hesitate to ask... 
 Yes, Dion. 
 It's yours. 
 You were a sparkling oasis in the desert of my love life. 
 What do you want to do? 
 Well, I was thinking about getting an abortion. 
 Right. Right. 
 You know... You know what? 
 Wha-Whatever you think is best. 
 I just want you to know that I truly, truly support... 
 I  was  thinking about it. 
 Until she changed my mind. 
 What?

 I don't even know your name.

 Let's explore that. 
 Do you want to be a real father to a real child that I am really going to have? 
 Yeah. 
 That's what I thought. 
 Oh, Christ. 
 This is supposed to be the happiest day of my life. 
 What? 
 You were about to have an abortion like five seconds ago! 
 Yeah, that's because I knew that you would react this way. 
 Oh, you... You. 
 Who was that? 
 Yeah, my lawyer. 
 And the mother of his child. 
 Found your phone in the wine room. 
 Missed a few calls.

 You got your lawyer pregnant? 
 How did that happen? 
 You know, the usual way. 
 Technically, she's not my lawyer anymore. 
 Oh, a technicality. 
 That's... That's good. 
 Seriously? 
 Your reaction to getting someone pregnant is to snort cocaine?

 Yeah, well, I'm fresh out of celebratory cigars.

 Why did that happen? 
 Uh, I called you multiple times. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I didn't have my phone on me. 
 Oh, good.

 Can I talk to you privately? 
 Yeah. 
 Um, why don't you go help Habib while I talk to Ms. Davis, okay, pal? 
 Right here. 
 Uh, T.J. got into a serious fight at school... 
 A fight that he started. 
 What? 
 Your son will be suspended for two days. 
 No... Jesus. 
 You know, Mr. Moran, I'm receiving a lot of pressure to bring in Child Services. 
 Wha... Pressure from who? 
 The principal, the administration. 
 T.J. hasn't spoken in a year. 
 (SCOFFS) His grades are failing. 
 And now he's violent in school. 
 Look, I'm telling you. 
 He... He must have been provoked. 
 (SIGHS) 
 You know, I came here today wondering if I could ease their concern about T.J.'s situation. 
 Look at him. Look. 
 You see how engaged he is? 
 I mean, surely there are other kids who are more in need of the protection of Child Services. 
 I smelled marijuana when I walked in. 
 You lied about having a Support Person. 
 I... Look, that was a misunderstanding. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I will be calling Child Services. 
 Why? Why would... 
 They'll make a visit unannounced to see if this is a suitable environment for T.J. 
 That's totally unnecessary. 
 Well, I'm doing you a favor. 
 I could lose my job if they found out I gave you a heads up about this visit. 
 Yeah, maybe you should lose your job.
