 Announcer : Previously on AMC's "Feed the Beast..." 
 TJ made it clear he wants to handle this himself. 
 My son's talking to you now? 
 Yes, you'll only make it worse. 
 Too soon. 
 Yeah. 
 What is going on? 
 I want you and your boy out of my place. 
 (SCREAMING AND YELLING) 
 (SCREAMING) You still have nine fingers, Dion. Let's introduce Kevin, your chef. You don't get to just say who does what. Contract you signed says I can. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) (CRACKLING) Jesus, what a douche. Calling him a chef makes me want to lick a meat slicer. Habibi, you interested? I swear to God, every time he opens his mouth, it's like listening to Emeril Lagasse's asshole. I told him I'm a vet. Dude still talks to me like I'm menial labor. Well, look at us. We look like nurses. Maybe I can still renew the lease on my food truck, you know? Guys, come on. You know how much this place means to me and Dion. Yes, Kevin's a joke, all right? But by the time we open, Thirio's gonna be great. We'll make sure of it. How? I got an idea. Why don't we invite him up here, and we calmly and rationally throw him off the roof? I'll go get him. (LAUGHTER) Whoa! Is there a party and I wasn't invited? No, seriously, I mean, are we on a break or something? People, we have two weeks until opening and a whole menu to test and prep. Let's go. Back to work. Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef. Oh, I'm sorry, man. I was trying to hit the trash. Do you think the sh1t you've been pulling this last week scares me? You know, I almost broke a guy's collarbone for locking me in a walk-in. You can screw with me if you want, but I'm the damn chef here. I'm not going anywhere. You come after me, I take you down (SNAPS) just like that. (SIGHS) Let's go. Play time's over. Got a hind quarter of beef needs butchering. Not my job. We got a guy for that. Well, "A," the guy's not here. "B," the guy's fired. And, "C," it's your job now. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) (SIGHS) Tom. I had a few thoughts about the wine list. All I'm saying is our menu's more local now. It doesn't make sense to serve a bunch of foreign wine nobody's ever heard of. Pee-lar! They'll hear about it when I tell them about it. Chef Mahoney, yes. Hi. Um, by the way, it's Pi-lar. Good morning, Tommy. Good morning. Listen, have the health inspector here Monday. I do not want to be 24 hours from opening and have to postpone because of some stupid little thing. Oh, uh, actually, that's not quite how it works. We have to submit a bunch of super-complicated forms, and then they cont... This is your job, Pee-lar. I know you can figure it out. Yeah, of course. I'll figure it out. And it's Pi-lar. You got this? Listen, about the other night when we... Yeah, I-I'm sorry. No, no.  I'm  sorry. I feel like I was rude. No. No. It's just I think you're great. Me too, you. The thing is everything's crazy right now getting ready to open, and I... I think it's better if we just, you know... But I'm glad you're here. Me too, you. (MONITOR BEEPING) Hey, Pop. Are you comfortable? Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of everything... The Asians, the business, all of it. I'm gonna step up. I'm gonna do this your way, you miserable son of a bitch. (DOOR OPENS) Sorry. This must be a difficult time for you. How is he? We're treating him for 19 stab wounds, severe damage to several vital organs, and a host of other problems that... I know all that. How  is  he? Well, I assume you also know when someone suffers a stroke during surgery, frankly, it's a miracle he's even breathing. So, what's next? Nothing's next. At a certain point, we have to let nature take its course. You should consider whether you want to sign a DNR. (CLEARS THROAT) You're saying he might die... but you're not gonna let him die. Mr. Woijchick, I would never promise any outcome, good or... (CELLPHONE RINGING) Excuse me. (SLOW MUSIC PLAYS) Hey, Davey. Mama's busy. Is everything okay? Well, I don't know. Who texted you? Oh, that. No. I'm okay. Don't worry. It's fine. Everything's fine. Okay. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ Fever dream ♪

♪ Yeah, we were gonna do this with Dion's lamb shank. That's very nice. Right, right, those tannins, that earth, that amazing structure. This... this would send your porterhouse into orbit. Found those lamps you were asking about, boss. What lamps? All the lighting's already taken care of. No, it's for the pass-through, to keep the plates warm. (KNOCKS) What? No. No, no, no, no, no. We're not... We're not having plates out on display like some greasy spoon. Did you see the Look Book? Look. Here. Rie planned it all out, all right? Look at this. We're gonna install panels so the kitchen will be invisible. All right, no noise, no distraction. The focus totally on the food. So the panels go in front of the lamps. No. There are no lamps, all right? We're doing this exactly the way Rie designed it. Sounds expensive. But it's your restaurant. Very nice, Patras. When you're done, drop them all in the marinade. (SCOFFS) Yeah, what's in the marinade? Secret. (CLATTER) Yo, T. T, he's got to go. Don't look at me. He calls himself a chef. He has a secret sauce, huh? McDonald's has a secret sauce! Look, what can I do, huh? My dad won't budge, and I'm all out of fixes for crap situations, which, by the way, could have been avoided if you weren't in such a hurry to open this place and... I don't know... had actually read the contract. That is  so  you. Blaming me for having a little passion about our dream. Look, even if we could get rid of him, we don't have time now to pull a new menu together before we open. I could put a menu together. No, yeah, really. I just need my kitchen back. Dion, forget it, all right? We got boned. We're just gonna have to roll with it. I mean, at least he likes the '09 Massolino. You know, he's not a complete idiot. Oh, oh, oh, I get it. No, no, no, I see it all now. Yeah, as long as you have all your beautiful wines, you're cool with Kevin. Are you insane? Yeah, well, you're settling. Have fun trading handjobs with your wine boyfriend, huh? I guess you won't be needing Rie's Bible anymore. What the hell are you doing?! All right. All right, no, good. Good, yeah. That's the Tommy I know and love, huh? Yeah, pissed that we might actually lose all of this! Do you think I really want to pair my wine with the meatloaf special? I'm in this  with  you, Dion. Hey, we're closed. But we have to go by the book, all right? If we... What is your damn problem? I just told you we're closed. What, are you deaf? Get the hell out of my restaurant. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. What's going on, brother? Hey, what's going on, man? I didn't know you were out. Yeah, come on. Let's go outside, huh? Come on. Let's go outside. So, how you doing, huh? Come on. Kevin : Back to work. Hey, I'm, uh, sorry about your father. I gave you something to hold for me. Tell me it's safe. Yeah, it's... It's safe. And keeping me up nights for all the wrong reasons. I'm raising the vig. I'll expect six grand. Patrick, come on. Look, I'm opening a restaurant. It costs money. Look, I'm scrounging just to come up with what we agreed to. The only thing we agreed to is that I own you. If I say the vig is six grand, that's what you pay me. Clear? (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) (TIRES SQUEAL) Hola. Hola. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Ah,  aquí estás.  Restock the sodas. I'm off today. I mean, I'm working, but I'm doing my other job. You mean your job as an actress, acting like you know how to run that stupid restaurant? I know what I'm doing. Then why are you here,  mamita? Because, uh, sisters help each other out. Ah, and exactly when do you plan to help me out? Because I could use a waitress. Por favor,  Blanca. I just need some advice about health inspections. Chica,  I got my hands full here running this restaurant. I don't have time to manage another one. (SIGHS) And why do you always find yourself in these type of situations? I'll help you tomorrow if I... Ohh! Oh, my God, are you okay? Ohh. Let me get some ice. No, no, no. No.  Estoy bien. Just... Just go. I'll see you later. Ohh. (UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) Cool, huh? That's my favorite one. You could borrow the book if you want. I stole it from the library. (CHILDREN PLAYING) What are you guys doing? Ignore him. (HORN HONKS) Oh, my mom's here. Got to go. (GLASS SHATTERS) (TIRES SCREECH) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SLOW MUSIC PLAYS) Mr. Moran? Can I show you something? Yeah, I've seen all these. Right. Yeah. But a couple weeks ago, his work started to change. He draws himself with other people. The colors are brighter. So he's... getting better? Well, we still have a ways to go to help him work through his trauma, but this is a positive step. Have you started cooking together? No, that's Dion. Oh. Well, having a support person in his life really seems to be making a difference. Yo, uncle! Hey, listen, man, uh, look, I need some dough. You already owe me for the plane ticket and the cash I floated you. Look, you know I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important, huh? You in trouble? Yeah, major. Tooth Fairy? Yeah, look, man, he's on my ass for six G's. Look, I don't have that kind of money here. It's Kittie with an I-E, right? There's a guy in Jersey owes me for a job. Give me a few hours. I'll get on my bike and head over there. Yeah, okay. (SLOW MUSIC PLAYS) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING IN DISTANCE) (LOCK TURNS) (KEYS JINGLE) (CAR STARTS) (SILENCED GUNSHOT) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS IN DISTANCE) ♪ It feels awesome. This is what we did... (LOCK TURNS) Val : False alarm. It's just Tommy. Hey, where's Kevin? Uh, meeting a vendor, sucking the life out of people's hopes and dreams. Who knows? Want me to kick your butt in cribbage? Huh? Go set up the board. And if you're looking for something to draw, here's the face of the guy who's gonna win, huh, right here. Do me a favor and dunk my head in this crap and hold it down until I stop breathing. Hello? Hey. Hi. I'm here about a job. Oh, okay. Um, yeah, good. I'll get you an application. D-Dude. Dude, dude. Don't be rude, huh? Let's show the, uh... the lovely young lady around here. I'm Dion Patras. Uh, my partner, Tommy, and I are the owners here. Oh, wow. Nice to meet you. Oh, nice to meet you, too. I'm Laura. Laura. That's a beautiful name. (CHUCKLES) Well, welcome to Thirio. Let me show you around. Look, this is the kitchen, obviously, you know, the belly of the beast, right? And, uh, this is the dining room, and you have to imagine it with 25 steel-top tables all spread out here. It's gorgeous. Gorgeous. Right, you know what? You're gonna fit right in. (CHUCKLES) So, what made you decide to open a restaurant? Well, you know, I've been, uh... I've been cooking since I was a kid. You know, I feel like it's something I was put on this Earth to do, you know? So you're an owner  and  a cook. Well, I'm a... I'm a chef. (CHUCKLES) Hmm. Hi. Hi. Hi. So, have you waited tables before? Yeah, when I was 16. I'm not here about a waitress job. I, uh... I'm a cook, too. Oh, right. I'm... I'm sorry. I thought you were here for... My dad hired me to work on the line. Your dad? Kevin Mahoney. The executive chef. I just, uh, came to drop off my paperwork. I guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other. (SIGHS) Is he okay? Yeah, yeah. Uh, your dad's not here right now, but I'll make sure to get these to the manager, and we'll see you, um... when you start. (THUD) Thanks. Okay. Hey! Hey! What's the big deal, huh? So there's another cook on the line. Yeah, his daughter. She might be good. Good?! Well, she looks like she's never boiled an egg. Look, and how are we gonna pay her, huh? Your dad's money's gonna cover another salary? Actually, Aidan's not covering much of anything lately. Right, right, so Kevin makes us hire his precious little girl. Meanwhile, I got to un-hire one of my guys. Look, man, I made promises, T. These guys left their jobs for me! I know. I know. Look, this is our restaurant. What, we don't even get to hire our own people? We signed a contract, okay? It's too late. We're stuck. No, no,  you're  stuck. I don't get stuck in anything. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (TELEPHONE RINGS) (DETECTOR BEEPS) What? What is this emergency? I'm in the middle of a deposition. I just got one thing I need to ask you. Look, I need to get out of an agreement that I didn't know I was agreeing to. Are you kidding me with this? Look, just... Just hear me out. All right, a contract is invalid if it has things buried in it that weren't pointed out, right? Look, it's like those... those Internet contracts, you know? You click "agree" just to get on with your life. Did you sign the contract? Yeah, yeah, I signed it. Then it's valid. I'm busy. (DETECTOR BEEPS) (CELLPHONE RINGING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Uncle, what's going on? Hey, I'm heading to New Jersey now. I should be back with your money in about an hour. Great, see you later. Okay. (GRUNTS) I wake up five, six times a night. I'm moody. I'm telling you. This Chinese situation is driving me tri-polar. (SLOW MUSIC PLAYS) Is that that son of a bitch Stavros? I  hate  that asshole. (TIRES SCREECH) (GRUNTS) 
 
 (BIRDS CHIRPING) Good morning. And that's the last good thing I have to say. You lost the Sinclair Plaza contract. What the hell are you talking about? Troy Scaffolding underbid you. We had a deal. Mm, you had a handshake, which doesn't mean crap nowadays. Damn it. Right. Boo-hoo. But that contract was supposed to cover your medical expenses and that fakakta restaurant you're starting. So transfer some money. From where? You're no longer worth what you think you are, Mr. Restaurateur. Go screw yourself, Ruth. I'd love to, Aidan, but I'm too busy trying to keep your head above water. What am I paying you for? I thought you people were good with money. I'm a Jew, not a magician. How are you, by the way? The treatments doing any good? I'm fine. That restaurant is the tip of the tidal wave. The Bronx is about to explode, and I'm gonna be right in the heart of it. Let's hope so because you're running out of money. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) There you are. I've been trying to reach you. I must have called you like 10 times today. Listen, uncle, I need that cash. Jesus, man. What happened? Motorcycle versus truck. You... You okay? (SCOFFS) I'm a tough, old b*st*rd. Did you, uh... get the money? I was busy getting this. Look, I know... I-I'm sorry. Look, at least it's not worse, huh? My guy in Jersey took off with the cash when I didn't show. Oh, j-just forget the money, huh? Just let me know if there's anything I can do. I got hit by a truck. I'm good. (GROANING) (SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE) (BELL JINGLES) Hey, Patras, where you been? I feel like you don't want this relationship to work. I got no information for you. It's hard to believe you haven't heard anything about that drug operation 'cause I know how much time you spent cozying up to your Tooth Fairy friend. Look, I'm sorry he doesn't divulge his deepest secrets while I'm braiding his hair. Good luck catching your white whale, all right? No, no, no, no, no. We're gonna take this to the next level, okay? Look, I just told you I can't give you what you want. And now you want more. Look, Christ, what is it with everybody, huh? You make an agreement, and then they change it on you? Yeah, well, you know what? A relationship is a two-way street. Yeah, if I'm gonna help you out, then I need to get something out of it. Yeah, quid pro quo. (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) Blanca? Oh, my God, what happened? I couldn't wake her up. Is she gonna be okay? We'll take good care of her. But where are the kids? With my mom. (CELLPHONE RINGING) Tommy, there's been an ac... Tommy : Has Aidan sent the next installment of seed money? Uh, no, sorry. I-I can't deal with that right now. I-I have an emergency. Why, what's going on? I-I don't know. My sister's unconscious. What? W-What do you mean? Where are you? There's an ambulance. I'll get back to work as soon as I can. God, Pilar, no, don't worry about that. We'll... We'll cover things here. I-I called your dad's office about the money. He said it comes when it comes. And the health inspection's gonna have to wait, too. I'm so sorry, Tommy. I'm coming, too. Did she hit her head? No. Yes! She... she fell yesterday. 51 to Richman. Possible subdural hematoma en route. Patient unresponsive. Let's go. She got right back up. She seemed fine. (SIREN WAILS) ♪ Aidan, it's Tommy. Call me back. Hey, yo, T, is Pilar here? Huh? No, look, whatever you want to buy, forget it, okay? Gold-plated whisk... Too bad. I don't want to buy anything, all right? I just need some money to pay my crew, who are  this  close to bailing on me. Well, Pilar's not here. Kevin : The key is to add a little nutmeg to the rub. Hey, Patras, I'm demoing a new recipe, in case you didn't notice. Oh, yeah, well, let me know what you're making. I'll look it up on deliciousdishes.com. (LIGHT LAUGHTER) (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) Tommy : All right, buddy, I'll be back in a bit. No more ice cream. Finish that, and then go get washed up. Hey, hey, what are you doing? Uh, Kevin needs another case of shiitakes. Well, can it wait? I was hoping you could watch T.J. while I go talk to my dad. Well, T.J. can come with. Hey, come on, champ! Come on. Let's go. Yeah, by all means, take the car. I'll take the subway. It's only 50 below out. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (SLOW MUSIC PLAYS) Yo, Cesar! Hey,  amigo, amigo. Cómo estás? I'm good, man. Listen, you wouldn't mind showing my buddy T.J. how the forklift works, would you? Sure, let's go look. Have fun. - Ese. What's up, man? Got something to sell? Yeah, I got something. (WHIRRING) Cesar : Then I lift it up. Now... See this knob here? That tilts the blades. Try it. (WHIRRING) MAN:  Cesar Moreno to purchasing. That's me. Back in a minute, little man. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) (SIREN CHIRPS) What you doing, kid? (CAR DOOR CLOSES) What was that? Answer me. Don't move! Hands out of your pockets now! How did you get in here? Huh? What, you're too tough to answer questions? Answer me when I talk to you! Answer me! Hey! Hey! Yo, yo, yo! Yo! What the hell's going on?! This kid with you? Yeah, he's with me. Just get off of him! He can't be running around here alone. This is a secure area. Dude, he's 10! Well, then you should keep an eye on him, then. Yeah, you should learn how to do your damn job, man! Get out of here! Oh, man, you okay? He hurt you? All right, come on. Let's get you home. What, that make you feel good? (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) Why are you blowing off our restaurant manager? That girl's the manager? Christ. You hired a bean-eater as your bean-counter. And why aren't you returning my calls? Frankly, I don't enjoy talking to you. You know, I don't give a damn what you enjoy, as long as you pay us the money you owe. That money's tied up right now. You signed a contract. The same one where you... You buried the detail about choosing your own chef. Eh. Why don't you read the fine print of  my  contract? You don't give us the money you owe us tonight, you don't see T.J. anymore. Fine. Then I'll hold on to the money. I'm saying, hypothetically, we could withhold T.J.'s visits. (SCOFFS) Jesus. You are the worst negotiator. A little advice? Next time you want to do business, bring your partner. Just send the money. I'll talk to my accountant. Pussy. Asshole. (DOOR SLAMS) (SLOW MUSIC PLAYS) (SNIFFLING) Thanks. (SNIFFLES) (EXHALES SHARPLY) Family? Father. You? Sister. You okay? (VOICE BREAKING) I'm scared she's never gonna wake up. (GASPS) None of this would have happened if I hadn't bothered her with my stupid questions about managing a restaurant, which I know next to  Nada  about. I'm so in over my head. (SNIFFLES) "Health inspection in a week? No problem." What? It's only a matter of time before they fire me for being a total fraud. (SNIFFLES) I used to own a restaurant. Yo, big man, I got you a beer. Huh? Get out of here. Go on. I got you milk. (SIGHING) Listen, uh, Teej, tonight really sucked, huh? Yeah. Yeah, truth is, uh, that could happen again, you know? Well, it's the Bronx. It will happen again. Listen, man. People are... gonna assume things about you, you know, 'cause... 'cause you're black. You just got to know that. You got to know how to protect yourself. All right, if that ever happens to you again, with a... with a cop, store owner, a neighbor, whatever, you just... you just show them your hands, okay? Yeah, don't grab your phone, make any sudden movements. You just... Just show them your hands. All right, you don't have to talk. You just... just do exactly what they say, okay? And this... your hoodie... That doesn't help. You know, you're, uh... You're gonna feel like you want to fight back. But, you know, sometimes it's... It's better not to. Sometimes that only makes it worse. So you got to be smart. And you got to... You got to know when to pick your battles. (SLOW MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ What the hell?! I gave it some thought, and I canceled the order for your panels. They're not gonna work. I thought we agreed to stick to what's in the Look Book. Your wife was clearly a good artist. That does not make her an architect. It does not make her a chef. It's not your decision. It's Rie's. Tom, Rie's not here. And I'm sorry about that. I truly am. But I'm trying to do the job that I was hired to do, okay? You understand that? Look, uh... the way I acted earlier was unprofessional, and I apologize. I'm ready to get to work. Okay. Well, great. Start by prepping your mise. (KNIVES SLIDE) You're right. He's a total dick. Acts like he owns the place. Well, what happened to "roll with it"? I didn't mean roll over. Look, he... He got rid of Rie's panels. Look at this. Are... are you okay with these? Look, I know Rie's design is important to you  and  me. But, yes, as a chef, the lamps are practical. If we get slammed, we'll have plates dying on the pass without heat. And you know what? He's... he's right. You know, the panels will cost us a fortune. And when did you have  this  epiphany? Oh, look, I'm just tired of losing sleep over this guy. Look, if we keep fighting him, we're the ones who end up with black eyes. Hey, Patras, the walk-in's a mess. Get in there and organize it, would you? Yes, Chef. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) Tell Olszanski to expect a call from the Deputy Mayor's office about expediting my friend Ms. Herrera's request. Thanks, Joey. I don't know how you did that, but thank you. It's gonna be crazy getting everything ready. I'd hate for you to have gone through all this trouble, and we don't pass the inspection. You'll pass. (SLOW MUSIC PLAYS) Patras, you're 30 minutes late. Sorry, Chef. Won't happen again. Hey. Teej, I'm gonna warm up the car! Hey, yo, T, we're... We're cool, right? Where were you last night? I stayed with my Uncle Stavros. He... he needed a hand. He's still pretty banged up from his accident. I see, so you selflessly agreed to spend the night in a brothel. He's very accommodating lately. Hey, Teej, jacket's not enough. Go get your hoodie. You don't want to wear it? Okay, well, get something else. It's cold. What the hell? Yo, the... The hoodie thing... That could be because of something I said. Look, T.J. got hassled by security at Hunts Point last night. What? He's... He's fine. I talked to him about it when we got home. Wait, wait. What do you... What do you mean? What happened? What did you say? I told him how to handle the cops when he gets harassed for... I don't know... Existing while black. You gave him "The Talk"? Yeah, I talked to him. No, no, "The Talk." The one that parents have with their black sons to prepare them to be treated like criminals. I don't know, man. I just... I just told him to be smart. Jesus, Dion! Look, who the hell are you to have  that  conversation with my kid? Look, I just said... He's my son, and Rie's. And I think she knew a lot better than you about the reality of being black. You crossed a line, man. Guess what. The inspection's all set. Great. Great. My, uh, sister has a brain bleed, but she's stable. Thanks for asking. Pilar, I'm sorry. I'm glad she's stable.

That's it. (CLEARS THROAT) (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) Keep working, kid. You're doing good. (SIGHS) What are you looking at? Oh. (CLEARS THROAT) You like that? Here. Hold it. Have a great night, Dion. Yeah. You have fun. Hey, you know, I got to confess that... That marinade's kind of growing on me. Hey, don't tell anyone I said that. Okay, Patras, what's the deal here? Why... Why the sudden turnaround? It's kind of giving me the creeps here. (CHUCKLES) No, man. You know what? I-I just realized, you know, a couple of months ago, I was in prison. And while everyone else was being miserable, I was actually kind of happy. You know why? Why's that? Well, they let me cook. You know, so if I could be happy there, I mean... come on... What am I... What am I doing complaining about this gig, huh? I'm still cooking. Right? The bottom line is you and I both want the same thing. We want this restaurant to succeed. That's what I'm talking about. Okay. All right, then. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ You all right? I know you said you were okay about what happened at Hunts Point last night, but... it's all right not to be okay. You know, your mom and I struggled with this, too, about... (SIGHS)... About what to say to you, if we should say anything. What she wanted you to know... (CHUCKLES) She wanted you to know you could be anything. You could do anything. You don't have to change or act any different than you want to. You have every right to be the beautiful, talented young man you are. Okay? All right. (CHUCKLES) Love you. (SLOW MUSIC PLAYS) (GRUNTS) All right. Aah! Okay, I'll tell you. The secret is paprika. That's the secret to your sauce? Even more boring than I thought. Oh, eat me. Mm. Not even with your secret sauce. (BOTH LAUGH) Yo, can we get two more? Uh, I got to get up at 5:00. Got... Got to get those salmon filets, so... Some life we have for ourselves, huh? Hot, cramped kitchens, 17-hour days. Oh, the only perk is all the, uh... All the trim we get. Oh, yeah? Lucky you. It's good to be young. I haven't been laid in like a year. What? Well, no wonder you're such a dick. (BOTH LAUGH) No, seriously, an, you got... You got to get your priorities straight. Look, check out this little tasty I banged last night. You got pictures? Yeah, you want to see? Oh, yeah. Mm, really? Look at those legs, huh? Yeah. Oh, we're going up. Oh, man. Go, go, go. Oh, you're killing me. Come on. Look at those tits. Nice tits. Perfect. Perfect tits. You think the, uh... The body's hot? Want to see the face? Yeah, show me the face. That's my daughter! Well,  that's  gonna get confusing. She calls me "daddy," too. Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy, pal. Mind your business! You just hit a cop. NYPD! Excessive? Well, appropriate. There's your quid. You owe me pro quo big time. Let's go. Let's go. Ow! (KNOCK ON DOOR) You see? Necessity is the mother of invention. Listen, man, I can't keep paying this much. (CELLPHONE RINGING) Hello? Hi. They just left. The inspection was a breeze. I can't believe I was such a stress ball. So it all worked out. Yes. Thank you so much. Well, glad I could be of help. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) God, you look good in this light. Thanks, I mean, I wish I could... I wish I could say the same. (LAUGHS) Listen, man, look. The boys are back, huh? Feels good. And this, God damn it... this has got to go. White is definitely not right. Boom. Feels good. Yeah, it feels great. You know what would make me feel even better? (SNIFFS) Kevin's secret sauce. First one to hit the street light wins. (SCOFFS) (GLASS SHATTERS) Ohh! That was close. So, wait... So, all that sucking up, all that "Yes, Chef"... That was all a con. And you banged his daughter just to piss him off? Well, you know, I took one for the team. What about the bar? What if there wasn't a cop there? The good news/bad news is I attract cops. And tonight, you know, it was good news. Watch this. (LAUGHS) Bam! Aah! Hey. That talk you had with T.J... Yeah, I know. I know. I know. It's my job. You're the cool uncle. I'm the dad. Trust me, I don't want to be the dad. Marisa : Damn it. Damn. Damn it. Damn it! (SOBS) Man : Little T.J. (SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE) (UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) Here's to it. To you, chef. To you. Hey, yo, yo, T-Bone! What's up, man? You got the goods? Bring it here, man. (SIGHS) Oh, look at that. Look at that. Get some of this, huh? Mmm! Oh, now, that... That is good food, I'm telling you. You try some of this? Got to get a piece of everything here, even some of the herbs. It's all important. It's all flavor. Take a piece of that with the beets right there... You see what happens when you mix the flavors. (CHEWING) See what I mean? They c... They complement each other. What do you want? You want a piece of this meat? (GRUNTS) (GLASS SHATTERS)
