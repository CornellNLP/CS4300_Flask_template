 Announcer : Previously, on AMC's "Feed the Beast." 
 I googled what happened to your mom. 
 (TIRES SCREECHING, GLASS SHATTERING) 
 Do you remember anything? 
 We'll need a third of what you owe us. 
 That's like... $200,000. 
 Talk to me! 
 I can't help you unless you say something! 
 I'm reorganizing. 
 The cop who put me away is still meddling. 
 Too rough. I'll call Patrick. 
 It's not happenin'. 
 Something has to be done. 
 (FIRE CRACKLING) 
 (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (ROPE CREAKING) 
 (CELLPHONE VIBRATING) 
 (VIBRATION STOPS) 
 Hey, Dad. It's not like you to be late for a meal. 
 I'll see you soon, okay? 
 (CELLPHONE THUDS) 
 (BLUESY MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (SEA BIRDS CALLING) 
 Bullshit. 
 Mr. Moran, sir. 
 Look, I just came to... 
 To bullshit. 
 (EXHALES) Look, it's just an advance, you know? 
 For... for Thirio. 
 You don't need money for the restaurant. 
 Business is good. 
 No, it's for some other crap you got your dick stuck in. 
 You really wanna know? Yeah. 
 I'm in trouble. All right? 
 I owe someone big-time. 
 I've known you since you were a boy. 
 In all that time, there hasn't been a day you  weren't  in trouble. 
 I'll make it worth your while. 
 Huh? It's like you said. The restaurant's doing great, which means I can afford to pay you back at a premium. 
 I mean, that's on top of your investment Believe it or not, I did not invest in the restaurant because of your lamb chop. 
 I did it for myself. 
 And more importantly, my grandson. 
 (SWALLOWS, GROANS) 
 So for once, Dion, you are not the center of the universe. 
 Now do you mind? 
 Fine. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (BREATHES HEAVILY) 
 Hey, Teej. 
 I found these upstairs. It's from your school. 
 Do you have art in this show? 
 Well, it's tomorrow night. 
 I can come, right? I wanna see your artwork. 
 Hey. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 Where were you so early? 
 Errands. 
 Look, um, I know yesterday was really intense for all of us. 
 (UTENSIL CLINKS) 
 How you doing? Are you okay? 
 You feeling... sad about it? 
 Scared? 
 Okay. 
 Do you feel guilty? 
 (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Hi, Mom! 
 Hey, T.J.! 
 (TIRES SQUEAL) 
 (RIE SCREAMS) 
 No! T.J., do you feel guilty? Well, I get that. But you know what? You feeling guilty about what happened to Andre? Means you care. You got a conscience, a heart. That's a good thing. I love you. (KISSES, PATS BACK) (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Fever dream ♪

You know, people are gonna be saying a lot of things. And your teachers... Oh, and the teachers might even ask you some questions. So you know what you gotta do? All right. What's the capital of Slovakia? Exactly. You don't know. You gotta pretend like they just asked you, "What's the capital of Slovakia?" And you don't know. All right, good man. (DISHES CLATTER) Hey. You gotta stop doing that. Doing what? The unsolicited parenting thing. Oh, come on. I was just trying to... That's not your call. You're gonna be a dad, right? How would you like it if someone gave  your  kid advice that you totally disagree with? (LOWERED VOICE) All right. I'm sorry. (DISH CLATTERS) Yeah, what's this? Oh, what? You got an art show? Look at that. You want me to come to this? Yeah? Hey, you know what? You know, this is probably something for you and your dad. Hey, but he's gonna tell me all about it, right? Yeah. Right. You know what? Um, I mean, if he wants you to come, you should come. You sure? Yeah. All right. All right. Yes. Thanks, man. Dion : Hey. Hey. Morning. Hey. Morning. Are you okay? Yeah, I just don't know what to do about T.J. I mean, he brings a gun to school and there are no consequences? What kind of life lesson is that? What happens when he's a teenager? Well, maybe he's... And Dion's solution to everything is for him just to lie to everyone. Maybe it'd be good for you to step away from this for a little bit. You know, we could go grab some coffee? Go for a walk? I mean, we've never actually done either of those things. There's always something going on. I know. So... coffee? I can't. I'm sorry. My brain's about to explode. It wouldn't be fair to you. Rain check? Sure. Marisa : Hi, Mom. Hey, do you know where... What? What's the matter? The hell were you thinking? Leaving his body where it could be found. You asked me to... I said I wanted the  Wloski  cop disappeared, not put on display. You realize the heat that's going to come down on us? (LOWERED VOICE) Did you want him dead or not? When you  finally  carry out an order, you screw it up. My own son! I teach you everything since you were a boy, but I can't get through. Something is missing. You tell me, what is it? I... (INHALES DEEPLY) I don't know what you're... (INHALES DEEPLY) What are you talking about? It is if you are compensating for some defect of character. (MELODIC MUSIC PLAYING) (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) You son of a bitch. You went through with it. Whoa. Hang on a second. What are you talking about? The recording on your voice mail. You plan to kill Patrick Woijchik. All right, first of all, that was not my plan. It was the cop who wanted... That cop is dead. Dion, what did you do? Nothing. G-Giordano... he called it off. Besides, I'd... Then why is he dead? I don't know. I swear. Hey, look, why you so upset? This was bound to happen. He was a dirty cop. Believe me, he was not a good human being. I mean, that guy was... Was my father. What? Guy... Guy Giordano is your father? Was. Why didn't you tell me when I played you the recording? Why didn't you say something? 'Cause I was trying to protect him. And I couldn't. I'm so, so sorry that you had to go through something like this. You know, I-I know what it's like to lose a parent. I really do. Stop. I-I-I can't be around you. I have to be around people that I can trust. Hey, hey. Come on, listen. Dion, no. Things just got very real for me. And  this,  this is... This is not real. What's that supposed to mean? I have to keep my family safe. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING) (GRUNTS) You could buy a new one. Why? What's wrong with this? I'll hold in my stomach. Uncle, listen, I really need to talk to you. I'm sorry. What the hell is going on? We are getting married. What? Tasha needs a green card. And I love her. Congratulations. (CHUCKLES) We need to talk... ...in, uh, in private. Already creating tension with your soon-to-be aunt. Uncle, the Tooth Fairy is demanding 1/3 of the money that I owe him. Look, did you see the news with that cop who got hanged? I think Patrick did that. I swear to God, if I don't pay him back, I'm gonna be next. How much? $200,000. Jesus, a few thousand, maybe. But $200,000? Oh, come on, you've always got a job lined up, right? I want in on something big. Ah. Hey, I know that look. Now whatever it is, I wanna be a part of it. Dion... Oh, come on. We stole from the wine warehouse together, didn't we? That went like clockwork. My next job is not some wine heist, okay? It's armed robbery, accent on the "armed." And with you on parole, you could get decades behind bars. Yeah, well, I'll take that chance. Dion, you're in a good place in your life. You're a successful chef, and more importantly, you're about to be a father. You need to be around for that. No, no, no, you don't understand. The Tooth Fairy is going crazy. I gotta score some money from somewhere. Even if I did think it was a good idea, which I don't, I can't bring you in. Someone else is pulling this job and he's not going to want you. You're a chef, not a gangster. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING) Lovely bouquet. What are you doing here? Research. I'm thinking of getting back into the restaurant business, so I'm curious as to what other people are doing. Patrick, I'm... I'm really busy, so... I'm sure Dion told you that I've got my eye on an exquisite property in Williamsburg. When I showed it to him, he showed genuine interest, if the word "genuine" can ever be applied to Dion Patras. I don't know why he'd be interested. I mean, Thirio's doing great. So it would seem, which is good for Dion's sake. And mine. Well... you don't owe me $600,000. (BOTTLE CLINKS) He shared that detail with you, right? Yeah. I'd reconsider my alliances if I were you, considering the financial burden and corresponding risk. What do you mean "risk"? (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Quiet intensity, not quite mature, dark body. What does this make me think of? Oh, right. Your son. Hey. This is my home. Get out of here. Get out of here! Needs to breathe. (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR CLOSES) (PAPERS THUD) Patrick! What are you doing here? I work here. This is your restaurant? Yeah, the one you helped me with. What are you doing here? Business. Oh. Uh, parking lot business? We're negotiating. Good to see you. Is everything okay? You should probably get back to work. I'm sure you have your hands full running this place. I can take a break. It'd be nice to catch up. I mean... if  you  have time. (VAN DOOR CLOSES) Is he your bodyguard? My associate. How long have you been in this business? I grew up in it. So... how's it going with the person you're in love with? Unrequited. Are you happy, Patrick? I have been. I enjoyed owning a restaurant. Why not do that again? Because it doesn't line up with my father's vision for our business. He found it... precious. That must be hard. You're a very... sensitive person. And it sounds like your father doesn't understand you. Why not step out of his shadow? Be yourself and do whatever it takes to make  you  happy? (DOOR OPENS) Hey, man. Listen, uh, just letting you know, my uncle's getting married. Don't ask. He wants to do it here at Thirio. I just had a face-to-face with Patrick Woijchik. What do you mean? He... he was here? He said you owe him $600,000. Is that right? It's a little more complicated than that. So your whole song and dance... "Do the restaurant for Rie. Do it for T.J." It was all bullshit. What exactly did he say to you? The truth. That this restaurant, that everything we've been working on is just so you can pay off a debt. You manipulated my feelings and you used my son to save your own ass. There's something you gotta understand first. If I don't find a way of paying him back, if... if I'd have left town, he said he was gonna kill everyone that is close to me. Give me a break. Starting with you, Tommy! He said he was going to kill you. And I couldn't let that happen. You mean more to me than anything. Come on, think back 25 years. My parents had just been killed. I'm... I'm living in my uncle's whorehouse. He's in and out of jail most of that time. And then you come along, and you give me the one thing that I needed... someone I could count on. You always used to say that I helped you, you know, standing up to those punk kids who were picking on you at school. (VOICE BREAKING) But, no. You... you helped me, Tommy. You... you saved my life. (SLOW TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING) So I can't let anybody hurt you. I had to think of something. threatened T.J. I'm gonna fix it. I swear to God, I'm gonna figure it out. We'll figure it out together. (SIGHS) (KNOCKS) I saw my father this morning. He certainly seems to be back to his feisty old self again. Yes. He's making progress. Wonderful. So you'll authorize his transfer back to prison. He's still in serious condition, just starting to rehab from his stroke. He'll rehab just as well in the prison infirmary. Is that really the safest option given what happened to him? You're not hearing me. My father is ready to go back to prison. Now. Hey, are you going into business with Patrick Woijchik? How do you know Patrick Woijchik? From the hospital. Uh, my sister and his dad were on the same floor. He helped me out when I was in a jam with the health inspection. Helped you out how? He made a call. He has connections. Okay, about those connections... There's a rougher side to Patrick's business that you may not know about. I kind of do know about that. I also know he's passionate about restaurants. Pilar, he's a criminal. Just... you should stay away from him. I'm telling you, there's more to him than you know. He could do more for us. I think it'd be good for both of you. Okay, you really don't know what you're talking about right now. I do. He's smart and he's savvy... Pilar, I've got a lot of crap I'm dealing with, and Patrick's at the top of that list. I get it. You think you know what's good for me, but you're wrong. I'm just trying to help. (SLOW-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
 (CITY AMBIENCE, HORNS HONKING ) (LINE RINGS) Hi, you've reached Marisa Gallo. Please leave a message. (BEEP) Hey. So I guess you're not gonna answer my calls. (SIGHS) Look... I wanna be a part of your life. And if I can't have that, then I at least wanna be a father to our kid. So, uh... you know, just... just letting you know that. Well, the sooner the better for me. Great. I'll see you then. What's going on? I have T.J. today. You think I'm gonna let him set foot in your house after what you did? Forget it. I've changed the locks on all my gun boxes. Won't happen again. Damn right it won't happen again 'cause I'm not letting him near you anymore. Do you understand? Somebody could've been killed. Fine. We won't go to my house. I'll pick him up later, take him for a bite to eat, and then we'll go straight to the art show. Does that meet with your approval? What? He invited you to the art show? Of course he did. Kid's crazy about me. I'm sorry. I can't. Thomas. Being with that boy is my one pleasure in life. Decades of radio silence and now this. This isn't you. It's the me I am now. You get to my age, you see the end of the road. Are you sick, Aidan? Nah. I'm old. Got issues, some of them not good. You gonna let me take him or what? Just this once. I'm not committing to anything. God forbid. Hey, T.J.! And just so you know, T.J. and I are going down to the school tomorrow and telling them the truth about that gun. Are you out of your mind? You got your set of morals, I got mine. Yeah, well, your morals are... (FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING) Hey! There he is. (CHUCKLES) We'll go get pizza later, then I'll take you to the art show, All right, kid? We'll talk later. (TWANGY MUSIC PLAYING) So we will set up the band over there. And, of course, we'll need a dance floor. Tasha : Yeah, a big one. She's right. We can't have people crashing into each other when they're dancing  hasapiko.  Ha ha! Hey, T.J. Hey, T.J.! (TIRES SQUEAL, RIE SCREAMS) T.J. : No! And then we'll need one huge table which is where we put the goat. Goat? He wants me to cook a goat. Tasha : Make it two goats. Stavros : Oh. 40 people, 20 a goat. Okay, why don't we all sit down and make a list? Food. Wine. Animals. It's a great idea. You... you guys do a list. Look, what the hell are you doing here? You can't expect a third so soon. Why do you always assume it's all about you, Dion? Patrick. Thanks for stopping by. Uh, why don't we go into the office? Hey, wait a minute. What the hell is going on here? We have a problem. I have a solution. (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Five minutes. Okay? (WHISPERING) Hey, hey? Thank you for your time. Obviously, we are eager to relieve Dion of the debt he owes you. So we're prepared to offer you one-quarter interest in Thirio. Tommy, what... Really? You'd forfeit 25% of your stake to cover Dion's screw-up? What a good friend. All right, let's just hang on a minute here. No, this... this is not something Tommy and I have fully discussed. Well, we'll fully discuss it after we have an answer. Patrick. I am... very interested. No, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Look, I owe you cash, not a stake in the restaurant that's an iffy venture at best. Your partner just offered me a percentage. I absolutely did. I'll have our manager... I am so sorry. No, no. ...draw up a contract. A stake in Thirio? It's off the table. It's not off the table. It's dangerous for a person to tell me no. But twice? We're not telling you no. I'm not telling you no. Patrick, I will pay you back. Just... just give me a chance to talk to him. Tommy just has his wires crossed. (SPEAKING OVER EACH OTHER) If this is how the two of you do business, I worry about your future. What are you doing? Well, T, I appreciate the gesture, but we do not want to get in business with Patrick Woijchik. You forget, I grew up with guys like that in my living room. All right? (CONVERSATION CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) I wish you both a long and happy life together. Sad that your nephew won't be around to share it with you. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION CONTINUES) Yeah, well, you can't make a guy like that happy. That's not how it works. Well, he's definitely not happy now. Uh, Uncle, could I, uh, could I have a minute, please? Man, I am begging you. You gotta talk to your guy about letting me in on that job. Look, the Tooth Fairy's going off the rails... There is no guy. I told you that because I wanted to protect you. It's my job and it's dangerous, but... But what? Maybe not as dangerous as being on the wrong side of that crazy Polack. So I'm in? All right, great. Come on, tell me. Tell me, what is it? One of my girls has a cousin who bartends at one of these high stakes poker games. Hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table, all cash. Nice. That's what I'm talking about. Be at my place at 7:00. Tonight. (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) (KNOCKS) Yo, T. Hey. Hey. Look, uh, I just wanted to let you know I'm not gonna be able to make it T.J.'s art show tonight. Why not? Well, I just gotta take care of somethin'. "Something"? Well, you. T.J. All of us. What are you gonna do? It's gonna help us out, man. Dion, there's no legal way you can get $200,000 tonight. Tell T.J. I'm sorry and, uh... and I'll make it up to him, all right? Hey. Don't do something stupid like getting killed. No, I won't. Just if anyone gets to kill you, it should be me. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Yeah. Right. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING) (TELEPHONE RINGS) Thirio. Oh, good. You're, uh, you're still there. Yeah, um, some stuff for tomorrow. I've been, um, I've been thinking a lot about you. About how I never know what I'm talking about? (CHUCKLES) No. Um... About how we've never gotten a coffee. Or gone on a walk, let alone had a proper date. And I'd really like to do something about that. (TENDER MUSIC PLAYING) God, I love that smile. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) You should call more often. Hey, do you wanna go to T.J.'s art thing with me tonight? I don't know. I mean, should our first official date be at T.J.'s school function? Well, I think it would mean a lot to him if you were there. I know it would mean a lot to me. All right. Yeah. Let's go. Great. I'll, uh, I'll pick you up... Now. Yeah? (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) (RECEIVER CLATTERS) Aidan : Not bad, kid. Looks just like the real thing. All it needs is a decent frame. We'll get one next time you come over, huh? Tommy : Wow. This is gonna be cool. Pilar : (CHUCKLES) Oh, my God. Hey, there he is! Man of the hour. How are you, buddy? Look who I brought. Are you kidding? Wild horses couldn't keep me away. All right, lead us to the T.J. Moran gallery. Is this... is this all you? Oh, my God! Oh, look at that great bridge! That's the Whitestone, right? Wow. Oh, Dion wanted to be here, but, um, some, uh, last-minute kitchen business came up. But we're here, right? Yeah. Wow, look at the house. Pilar : And  we  vote these the best pictures in the whole show. Hey, um, why don't you show Pilar around, and I'll catch up with you guys, huh? Yeah? I need to talk to you for a minute. It's important. (SIGHS) Make it quick. I've had my fill of kiddie art. Dion got us into some bad business that involves some... Some dangerous elements. Speak English. Who we talking about? The Woijchiks. Dion's a crazier b*st*rd than I thought if he got on the wrong side of that family. Problem is, now  I'm  involved, and it's put T.J. in danger. What the hell you talking about? Patrick specifically mentioned him. Then Woijchik needs to go away. What? No, that's... that's not what I'm talking about. I mean, it could be an empty threat. Exactly the problem with you, Thomas. You got this rose-colored view of the world. Patrick Woijchik has bodies on him. He'll have more. Thomas, you gotta learn how the world works. If some thug is threatening to hurt your kid, no choice. You protect your family. (SCOFFS) That's part of your newfound philosophy on life? Listen, you know I'm not healthy. I'd like nothing more than to take Patrick Woijchik to the grave with me. If he even breathes in T.J.'s direction, he's gone. (TWANGY MUSIC PLAYING) Mr. Moran. Hi. How's T.J. been? Um... given the circumstances, okay. It's such a difficult time for you guys. Well, everyone. Thank God no one was hurt. Yeah. Yeah, I went to go see Andre at the detention center. He insisted he'd never seen that gun before. I work with hundreds of kids, so I know when they're lying and when they're not. Why you telling me this? Well, T.J. and Andre have a long history. I'm asking you to tell me if T.J. indicates he knows anything else about what happened. All T.J. knows is Andre Walker brought a gun to school. (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) (METAL RATTLES) (METAL CLANKS) (OBJECT THUDS) (GAS HISSING) These are great, Lee. Oh. Hey. I think I'm gonna head home. But tonight was really fun. Thanks. You sure you don't want to maybe come back with us tonight? Tomorrow night's just as good. I wanna let you and your son have alone time. Thanks for being here. Hey, buddy. Goodnight, Teej. Loved your pictures. Bye, Lee. (WHISPERS) Bye. Bye. How 'bout it, you ready? Oh, great idea. Portrait of the artist. (CHUCKLES) All right, ready? (CHUCKLES) Nice. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) (MELODIC MUSIC PLAYING) (TRAIN RAILS CLACKING, SUBWAY NOISE) (HORN HONKS) (CELLPHONE VIBRATES) Hey, put that away. We have a job to do. Just a second. Dion, let's go. Your job is to hold this and to act tough. I'll handle the rest. Tons of action on that table. Five minutes. Your head in the game? Yeah, I'm good. Good. (GUN COCKS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (ENGINE STARTS) (ENGINE REVS, TIRES SQUEAL) (TIRES SQUEAL, RIE SCREAMS) Yo, take it easy! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (LAUGHTER) Man : See you $50,000 and raise 50. That was funny. Woman : Ooh, 50 G's. Uh, not for me. Woman : I'm out. Hands on the table! Eyes down! You! On your knees! Get down! Get down! Heads down. All right. Heads down, I said! (SCREAMS, CRYING) Stavros : I said... Do as I say! (COCKS GUN) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Let's get out of here. The goddamn Tooth Fairy?! Relax! He didn't see us! Yeah, he didn't have to with that damn accent of yours. (ENGINE STARTS) Let's go, go! (TIRES SQUEAL) (GUNSHOTS) Brush your teeth. I'll be up in a minute. (DOOR CLOSES) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) You okay? (GAS LEAKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (GAS LEAKING) (DOOR CREAKS) Hey. Everything okay? Yeah, it's gonna be. We got it. Do I even wanna know? (INHALES DEEPLY) No. (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (TIRES SQUEAL) (TIRES SQUEAL) (WINGS FLAPPING) Hi, Mom! Hey, T.J.! (TIRES SQUEAL, RIE SCREAMS) Hi, Mom! Hey, T.J.! (TIRES SQUEAL) (RIE SCREAMS) No! (TIRES SQUEAL) (WINGS FLAPPING) Hi, Mom! Hey, T.J.! (ENGINE REVS, TIRES SQUEAL) (ENGINE REVS) No! Aah! (TIRES SQUEAL) (CRYING) (CRYING, SNIFFLES) (GLASS CLATTERS) Daddy! Teej? T.J.?! Daddy? What? What... what is it? Tell me. M-mommy's accident. (SNIFFLES) It... it... It wasn't my fault. And... it... it... it wasn't an accident. (EXPLOSION) Aah! (FLAMES CRACKLING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) (FIRE ROARING) (MELODIC MUSIC PLAYING) (FIRE ROARING) Daddy! Daddy! (PANTING) T.J.! (GRUNTING) T.J., I-I got you. I got you, buddy. (WOOD CREAKS) T.J.! Aah! (GRUNTS) (FLAMES WHOOSH) (EXPLOSION) (CAR ALARM BLARING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
