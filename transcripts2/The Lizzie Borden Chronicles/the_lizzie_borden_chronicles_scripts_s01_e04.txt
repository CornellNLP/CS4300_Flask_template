 man : Previously on  The Lizzie Borden Chronicles... 
 Don't worry, we'll find him. 
 We'll find Benjamin and bring him home. 
 I wish you could come. 
 As do I. 
 It'd be good to see you happy. 
 Enjoying yourself, I mean. 
 My sister and I are moving in next door. 
 To be clear, you are despised. 
 The sooner you leave this neighborhood, the better. 
 So who are you? 
 I'm a private investigator. 
 [grunts] 
 You know who he works for? 
 Are you with the Pinkertons? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 My brother's missing. 
 What's your brother's name? 
 Spencer Cavanaugh. 
 I'm frightened, Lizzie. 
 I am not a monster. 
 Skipjack! 
 What? 
 man : How far we taking him? 
 Here is good.

 Good morning. 
 I brought you tea and blackberry scones. 
 Thank you. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Like I went away for a while. 
 Well, you needed it. 
 I don't remember anything after the drummer punched the man in the horse suit. 
 [chuckling] Oh. 
 That happened, right? 
 That happened. 
 What else happened last night? 
 Everyone had a lovely time, and I'm so glad you could be here to enjoy it. 
 [door opens and closes] 
 Had to have happened at the same time. 
 He cut her when she grabbed her gun, and she shot him in the moment of dying. 
 A dispute over money and s*x? 
 Crime of passion maybe. 
 Shame he had to take the girl with him. 
 This makes two. 
 Two what? 
 Multiple killings where the victims and the perpetrators have solved the cases for us. 
 Saved the state some money, I'd add. 
 Yeah. 
 Nice and neat.

 Take that! No! 
 The way Mrs. Kenney treats that dog is just awful. 
 Didn't see Adele at the party. 
 Mr. Flowers' visit really frightened her, so we thought it best if she left town for a while. 
 I helped her along with something of Daddy's.

 What do you want? 
 I want to stop you from killing your dog. 
 As if that's any of your business. 
 Is that your idea of discipline? 
 Perhaps you'd prefer something with a sharper edge. 
 Couldn't believe my eyes. 
 Badges carting the poor b*st*rd off like he was trash. 
 That's no way to get seen off. 
 Well, here's to Mr. Flowers. 
 [glasses clink] 
 Didn't know Adele had those kind of rocks. 
 Which one is Adele? 
 The one with the bad hand. 
 Ah, that's too bad. I liked that one. 
 Wouldn't think she could hurt a fly. 
 With a barking iron, she could. 
 Boom! 
 [laughter] 
 You're missing the point! 
 We're supposed to believe that Flowers, before he was shot or after, managed to cut her throat. 
 And she's supposed to have shot him, either cut or not cut. 
 Cops figure that they did each other at the same time. 
 The details of Mr. Flowers' sad demise are naught but idle speculation, and it's irrelevant to our present situation, gentlemen. 
 What matters now is that everyone knows that business is gonna continue on as usual. 
 Once we fill that empty spot at the top. 
 That position is taken. 
 Unless anyone has a better idea. 
 Well, there it is then. 
 [exhales]

 Isabel, what's all that? 
 Some folks on two ordered everything at the same time. 
 Get back down here as soon as possible. 
 We got some weather coming in, and I want the greenhouse shuttered.

 What's that? 
 He wanted it from his room. 
 [exhales]

 Bag on the bed, will you? 
 What are you doing? 
 Get back in bed. 
 [sighs] 
 You're not serious. 
 You're not going back down there like some avenging angel. 
 I'm not avenging anything. 
 I'm just killing what needs killing. 
 You should let the police handle this. 
 The police don't care. 
 You're bleeding from your ear. 
 You cracked your skull. 
 No, I just took a bad hit there. 
 You need to stop. 
 Please, Charlie, you're in terrible shape. 
 Mr. Siringo, sit down. 
 Please. 
 If you don't sit, I will fetch Marshal Hilliard and notify the hospital. 
 I will. 
 [coughs] 
 Were they trying to kill you? 
 They think they did. I'd like to keep it that way. 
 You didn't talk to Lizzie? 
 No, but she sent a pretty clear message. 
 She got Flowers' men to do this? 
 I followed Lizzie and Adele into the Row. 
 What is that? 
 Jerusalem Row. It's a bad part of town. 
 Fellow by the name of Skipjack did most of the damage. 
 Skipjack works for Flowers. 
 He was found murdered this morning. 
 A woman who whored for him shot him through the heart. 
 Is she alive? 
 Isabel : Her throat was cut. 
 What was her name? 
 The papers didn't say. 
 Hmm. It's Adele. 
 Lizzie said that she thought that this Adele might have run off with Spencer. 
 Of course she did. 
 When were they killed, Isabel? 
 Last night. You think Lizzie? 
 No, she couldn't have. I was with her last night. 
 You what? 
 Well, you didn't come back. I went to talk to her. 
 She was having a rather nice party. 
 Everything was fine. 
 Miss O'Keefe... 
 I got drunk and spent the night. 
 Well, you're lucky to be alive. 
 You want all four lots? 
 The ones surrounding Maplecroft. 
 And what is Maplecroft? 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 It's the name I've given our home. 
 Owning those lots would give my sister and I some peace and quiet. 
 There are homes on those lots. 
 I know. 
 With families living in them. 
 I'm prepared to make this happen by any means necessary. 
 Yes. 
 Well, the Hill is desirable territory. 
 Quite expensive and only likely to become more so. 
 Oh, I understand why. 
 It is a wonderful neighborhood but for the neighbors. 
 Here is my offer for the lot that is currently up for sale. 
 It's asking price plus half, in cash. 
 Ah. 
 I will gather the paperwork to properly present the offer. 
 Wonderful. 
 [wistful music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Morning, Miss Borden. 
 Seen the paper today? 
 Some tragic news from the Row. 
 Your brand-new business partner and your brand-new girlfriend dropped each other just like that. 
 Yes, I heard. 
 Bet you did more than that. 
 Am I meant to identify how long it's been since you brushed your teeth, or is there a point to this? 
 Point is, you got a new business partner. 
 No, thank you. I'm fine on my own. 
 Are you? 
 Are you fine? 
 I paid Mr. Flowers to take care of this. 
 He delegated. 
 I took some initiative and, without him knowing, put the boy away for a rainy day. 
 Terrible weather we're having, isn't it? 
 What is it you want? 
 First, I want to stay alive. 
 He's my insurance against any "axe" of Borden that might come my way. 
 Second, I want a thousand a week starting this Friday. 
 Well, that's impossible. 
 So is you murdering Mom and Dad and getting away with it. 
 Look how that wound up. 
 I can give you 1,000 a month to start. 
 Then 3,000 a month till the end of the year, but that is the best I can do. 
 After that, renegotiate the terms. 
 Of course. 
 You have my word. 
 Since Flowers don't need it anymore, right? 
 Deal. 
 First 250 this Friday. 
 See? I can count. 
 That one's yours. 
 Miss Borden, everything is taken care of. 
 Oh, if only that were true. 
 [chuckles] 
 It's me, Isabel. 
 Lizzie wrote you a note. 
 What's it say? 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm going to talk to Skipjack. 
 But you promised. 
 No, I don't believe I did. 
 I'm gonna pick him up after dark, and I'm gonna see what he has to say, Isabel. 
 Lizzie wants to have dinner with me. 
 Absolutely not. 
 Why? 
 Because it's too dangerous, that's why. 
 Well, then I'll do it in public. 
 Downstairs. 
 You think she's a complete monster, but I'm not convinced. 
 I need to look her in the eye. 
 Is it 'cause you're an actress? 
 Excuse me? 
 Is that why you can't believe she's fooled you? 
 That you would somehow know if someone so convincing has you duped? 
 You think she's completely wicked. 
 I've known Lizzie Borden all my life. 
 I know she's different. 
 I think you like being her friend because it makes you conspicuously scandalous. 
 What should I avoid? 
 I'm sorry? 
 On the menu. 
 Or is it all just passable? 
 I'll send a note back to Lizzie. 
 Make sure she doesn't touch your food. 
 What? 
 She made a run at getting cyanide before her parents died. 
 Poison? 
 And make sure you don't go back to her barn at her old house. 
 Why would she take me there? 
 [groans] 
 Because it's her killing ground. 
 Thank you, first, for agreeing to meet with me. 
 Of course. 
 There's something that I've been needing to get off my chest, something to do with finding William's body. 
 Something new come to light? 
 No. I know nothing like that. 
 I wanted to apologize again. 
 What for? 
 For my callousness in that moment, regarding William's state. 
 My fellow officers and I were rudely inconsiderate. 
 Sometimes in our job's... 
 Mr. Trotwood. 
 More gruesome moments, it helps to make... 
 Mr. Trotwood. 
 I'm deeply sorry. 
 I accept your apology. 
 Please don't think twice about it. 
 I would hate to think that I caused you any pain. 
 No, there is no pain. 
 You are appreciated, respected, and admired by me in every regard. 
 Is that everything? 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 There is another matter. 
 Not as fraught as the last, I hope. 
 Possibly. 
 Miss Borden, would it be all right if I called on you from time to time? 
 I would like that very much. 
 All right, then. 
 All right. 
 Good. 
 My first name is Leslie. 
 How beautiful. 
 Yeah, the boys enjoy it immensely. 
 [chuckles] 
 Would it be all right if I called you Emma? 
 It's about time for that, I'd say. 
 All right, then, Emma. 
 All right, Leslie. 
 Nance : Well, Fall River's not so small. 
 Well, it's no New York. 
 Nothing is, except New York. 
 Have you been to Paris? 
 I have. 
 It's wonderful beyond words. 
 Oh, I've always wanted to go there. 
 So you shall. 
 So tell me about Spencer's new play. 
 What's it like? 
 You haven't read it? 
 Mm. 
 He keeps his babies under wraps. 
 I can be quite critical. 
 You shouldn't be. It's marvelous. 
 Do you have a copy? 
 Yes. 
 You know, there's something almost autobiographical about the piece. 
 It pained him, the whole experience. 
 Perhaps there's some clue as to his whereabouts in the text. 
 I should read it then. 
 You should. 
 My copy is in the barn at the old house. 
 We set up a bit of a playhouse there. 
 Come with me. We'll fetch it. 
 I'd like that. 
 Oh, wonderful. 
 But I don't think I can right now. 
 Oh. Is there something wrong? 
 I'm just feeling a little overtaken still from last night's party, so I think it's best if I just go to bed. 
 Let me walk you to your room. 
 No, thank you. I can take care of myself. 
 Oh. 
 A woman living alone in New York City, I'm sure you can. 
 Yes. 
 Could you do me a favor and make sure that you drop the play off at the hotel's front desk? 
 Absolutely. I'll do that. 
 And that's all we talked about. 
 Travel and clothes, huh? 
 Nothing more. 
 So what's your opinion now? 
 I think that Lizzie Borden is a sweet woman with limited exposure to the world. 
 And she has no experience with men from what I can fathom. 
 Aside from killing them. 
 You don't see it, do you, Miss O'Keefe? 
 Not what you see, no. 
 [sighs] 
 
 
 
 So this man you're about to thrash, what's his name again? 
 Skipjack. 
 He used to run girls for Flowers. 
 Adele was one of them. 
 And he's down on this Jerusalem Row? 
 Hmm. 
 The Whale and Tar. 
 That's a bar, I assume. 
 Correct. 
 What if he and his men attack you again? 
 They won't. 
 Mind getting me another? 
 But if they do, we'll lose all possibilities of confronting Lizzie. 
 Siringo : I know what I'm doing. 
 And I know that your bullheadedness can risk us from getting the truth. 
 What do you suggest? 
 Hmm. 
 A softer touch. 
 Not a chance. 
 Oh, I think there's every chance. 
 I tell you what, I'm gonna talk to Skipjack about your brother and Lizzie. 
 You just sit tight. 
 [heart beating] 
 [grunts] 
 Are you all right? 
 [coughing] 
 [shushing] 
 It must be your head. Just stay there. 
 What did you do? 
 Shh. 
 I'm putting you in the wings, Mr. Siringo. 
 If Lizzie hurt my brother, I'm going to find out for myself. 
 You don't know what you're doing. 
 I'm not sheltered. 
 I'm not intimidated. 
 And I know men.

 Mrs. Kenney, perhaps you and I were not meant to be neighbors. 
 Oh, please tell me you're moving out. 
 Oh, no. 
 In fact, I've just purchased the lot behind yours. 
 I'm expanding Maplecroft. 
 What is a Maplecroft? 
 The Borden estate, which, for the moment, you are living on by my good graces. 
 How dare you? 
 Mrs. Kenney, you are not long for a nursemaid, perhaps even a home for the elderly and infirmed. 
 If you allow me to buy your property, you will have a very nice annuity to live out your final years. 
 I want my dog. 
 Or what? 
 I'm getting the police. 
 Emma : Making trouble?

 Just dealing with the inevitable. 
 What's this about expanding the Borden estate?

 I'm buying up all the land around us. 
 Planning to build a moat? 
 It's a smart investment. 
 Could we sit for a moment? 
 There's something I'd like to discuss. 
 Of course. 
 So serious. 
 No, no, no, not at... Not at all, no. 
 I wanted to tell you that things might be changing. 
 Changing how? 
 Mr. Trotwood and I are becoming friends. 
 Oh. 
 Is there a courtship on the horizon? 
 It's already here. 
 Will he be requiring a dowry? 
 Lizzie. 
 I... I'm happy for you. 
 I am. 
 Really? 
 Yes, of course. 
 I'm happy you found another suitor, that someone's come along at a better time. 
 But... 
 But what? 
 What will you tell him about Benjamin? 
 When intimacy occurs, he's sure to know that you gave birth out of wedlock. 
 Stop it. 
 What will you tell him? 
 Stop it. 
 You know, I just... I just think that you should tell him right away. 
 Get your past out in the open. 
 If he truly loves you, then none of this will matter. 
 Well, I'm off. 
 I have to return something to Nance's hotel. 
 Don't let that dog out of the house, no matter what Mrs. Kenney does.

 I'm afraid so. 
 Gonna need it back.

 Mrs. Kenney can gut and roast the damn thing. 
 It's her dog to do with whatever she wants. 
 Let's have it. 
 Trotwood, get the dog. 
 Sir, if you'd like to assure Mrs. Kenney of our intentions, I'll find the dog and bring it to you as soon as I do. 
 Fine. Make it quick. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sorry about that. 
 No, it's... 
 It's not your fault. 
 I understand Lizzie's need to protect a defenseless animal, but the marshal is right. 
 It is Mrs. Kenney's property. 
 Lizzie will be furious. 
 Well, how about I return this little animal? 
 And then I'll come back, and you and I will go on a nice, long walk. 
 Long enough to ensure that Lizzie is calm when you return.
