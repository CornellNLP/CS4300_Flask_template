 Previously on  The Lizzie Borden Chronicles...  
 Emma Borden, will you marry me? 
 Tell me where you buried the body. 
 Why would I do that? 
 So I can save both our lives. 
 She killed a guy. I hid him for her. 
 Who killed a guy? 
 Lizzie Borden. 
 I wanted to know if you photograph weddings in addition to the occasional corpse. 
 We'll get married. 
 What of Lizzie? 
 Oh, I'll get her. 
 You don't have to worry about that. 
 man : Is this your room? 
 man : Siringo, is this your room?

 [gavel pounds] 
 Judge Franklin : People of Massachusetts versus Charles Siringo in the murders of Spencer Cavanaugh and Isabel Danforth. 
 The most horrible, horrible thing that I have ever seen. 
 Ezekiel : That dead man's head and my poor, poor wife... 
 My beautiful Isabel was dead. 
 Skipjack : If I didn't lie, if I didn't tell him what he wanted to hear, he would've killed me sure. 
 Objection, how could you know what was in the defendant's head? 
 Because, you dumb son of a bitch, Marshal Hilliard stopped him from putting a bullet through mine, although there are those who wish he hadn't, I'm sure. 
 Initially I thought Mr. Siringo was simply intruding into these affairs out of arrogance, but then I came to see him as an ally in helping to discover who was responsible. 
 Well, he was your ally in that you were unwittingly drawn into helping him frame Miss Borden for his crimes. 
 Absolutely not. 
 That's not how I see it. 
 No more questions. 
 man : Charles Siringo has a unique skill in that he is able to blend himself into criminal situations. 
 Outlaws and wanted men see him as one of their own. 
 Have the Pinkertons considered that's because this man is a criminal? 
 man : He's a valued employee who has... 
 Who decapitated his former friend and cohort in crime Warren Stark for $250. 
 Is that correct? 
 Yes, plus expenses. 
 Just as he decapitated Spencer Cavanaugh. 
 man : Warren Stark had murdered two men in cold blood. 
 man : The defendant would go to the ends of the earth to bring down his prey, would he not? 
 Mr. Siringo is a determined hunter. 
 man : Most certainly, sir. Most certainly. 
 I have no hatred for Mr. Siringo. 
 Whatever demons drove him to commit these crimes are... 
 Well, they're his to suffer. 
 Well, for the record, Miss Borden, in the eyes of God, under the laws of Massachusetts, and in light of the defense's claims, did you have anything to do with the murder of Spencer Cavanaugh or the death of the woman Nance O'Keefe? 
 No. 
 Anything to do with the deaths of the man known as Walter Flowers or the woman Adele Swain? 
 No. 
 Your half-brother or his victim William Almy? 
 Lizzie : No. 
 The photographer Phipps? 
 No. 
 Your neighbor, Mrs. Irene Kenney. 
 No. 
 Your parents, Andrew and Abby Borden? 
 No. 
 man : The prosecution rests. 
 We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder. 
 [people cheering, jeering] 
 [gavel pounds] 
 Judge Franklin : Charles Siringo, this court remands you into the custody of Marshal Hilliard for transport to the Charlestown State Prison until such times as you are put to death. 
 Court adjourned.

 Hilliard : Get up. 
 Has my carriage arrived? 
 Visitor. 
 I'll be right outside. 
 I'll be fine. 
 [chuckles] 
 Ah, Lizzie, if you're here to gloat, get on with it. 
 I came out of respect. 
 Like we're on some field of battle. 
 It's like fate brought you to me, Charles. 
 Is it? 
 I thought it was your sister's check. 
 How you guys doing, by the way? 
 Oh, fine. 
 What she did, she did out of love. 
 Can't fault her for that. 
 Why did you kill Isabel Danforth? 
 She give you away? 
 Why don't you go get Hilliard and let me out of this cage? 
 And I'll finish it real quick. 
 [giggles and sighs] 
 You're a lion to the last, aren't you? 
 I'm just a man looking at a sick animal that should've been drowned at birth. 
 I want peace, Charles. 
 Not while I'm alive. 
 Well, I can wait. 
 Good-bye, Charles. 
 See you soon. 
 Trotwood : It's all over now, Emma. 
 I know. 
 We can create the life we want, you know? 
 I've done it before. 
 My life in south Boston held far darker prospects when I was younger. 
 I love my family... I always will... but I chose not to be a part of their world. 
 I left all that trouble behind me. 
 I won't leave Lizzie. 
 Don't ask that of me. 
 She's all I have. 
 We've always been there for each other. 
 And my brothers were always there for me too, but there came a time when I realized that if I stayed... 
 All right. I should go. 
 We're not moving Siringo until the morning, so I'm going to assist with the overnight. 
 Lizzie would never hurt me. 
 I'm not saying that she would. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm saying there's trouble here, and you can choose to live with it or without it. 
 [door squeaks] 
 Is everything all right? 
 Yes, fine. 
 Take care. 
 Lizzie. 
 Now that the trial's over, is the wedding back on? 
 Yes, we'll be resuming plans, yes. 
 Are you happy about that? 
 Emma, what is wrong? 
 All I wanted was to help you. 
 All I wanted was to prove your innocence. 
 Lizzie : And you did. 
 It would take a monster to do the things that were done to those poor souls, a monster like Charles Siringo, not me. 
 And everyone sees that now. 
 But my wish to clear your name brought catastrophe on everyone. 
 Not on us. 
 If the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, then your wish has put Charles Siringo headed down the right path. 
 Lizzie : It's all right. 
 Emma. 
 I forgive you. 
 [Emma crying] 
 Lizzie : Shh.

 What is that? 
 It belonged to Phipps. 
 You remember him, don't you? 
 Take it. 
 If you want, you can make more pictures for your scrapbook, or you can smash it. 
 Never have to worry about him coming back to haunt you. 
 What's the point? 
 The point is, I gave it to you when I could use it to keep squeezing you dry, but I don't want to do that. 
 I want to be done with you for good. 
 And that? 
 It's for my own protection. 
 From me? 
 Oh, you're god damn right from you, should you think of sending me off like everyone else whoever looked at you funny.

 No more dirty work. We're done with each other.

 Miss Lizzie. 
 How are you? 
 I'm very well, Leslie. Thank you for asking. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Oh, yes, yes. I'm here on wedding business. 
 Oh, um... 
 Well, what would that be? 
 That would be pearls, specifically a beautiful string that I can't seem to find in any of the boxes at Maplecroft. 
 You don't think they were stolen, do you? 
 No, I think they were left behind at the house on 2nd Street. 
 Emma and I chose to leave a few things in the attic with the intention of gathering them later, and I think, although I can't be sure, that the pearls were in one of Emma's trunks near the window in that attic. 
 So you need help fetching the trunk. 
 No, just the pearls. 
 But you can't get them yourself. 
 Well, I could, but... it's the house. 
 It frightens me, Leslie. 
 Since the move to Maplecroft, I've come to see that house as a dreadful old place with dreadful memories that I'd rather avoid, and being a woman alone in that big... 
 I understand perfectly. 
 I knew you would. 
 So at your convenience, then? 
 Well, finding lost valuables happens to fall under my job description. 
 [chuckles] You are a dear. 
 And don't tell Emma. 
 I want it to be a surprise. 
 Of course. 
 man : Move. 
 I told you to leave town, but you didn't listen. 
 Now you're gonna be going in the wagon to Charlestown to hang. 
 You know I'm innocent, Marshal, and you know she killed those people. 
 Twice you've let her get away with slaughtering innocent people. 
 How many has she butchered, Hilliard? 
 What is it at? Eight, nine? 
 All on your watch. 
 Yeah, my watch, not yours. 
 I did everything I could. 
 Then give me a gun and let me kill her, 'cause you're too much of a chickenshit! 
 [men grunting]

 Emma, I'm so sorry. 
 You found Benjamin? 
 Where did you find him? 
 He was in the old house in the attic. 
 You found him in the attic? 
 Leslie found him. 
 Oh, God. 
 He went there for you to get something for me, he said. 
 Yes, I... 
 I told him everything. 
 Everything? 
 The friend of father's. 
 The months I spent pregnant and hidden away at 2nd street. 
 Benjamin's birth and his... and his death... 
 [crying] 
 That we kept... we kept it hidden for so many years until William tried to blackmail us. 
 Emma, I'm so sorry. 
 I've ruined everything. 
 You didn't. 
 I'm the one who sent him to the house to get the... 
 He forgives me. 
 Oh. 
 None of it matters. 
 He forgives me for anything that happened in the past. 
 He loves me, and he loves the life we're going to make together.

 He's such an amazing man. 
 Trotwood : Emma. 
 Up here, darling. 
 The druggist said this would help you get some sleep. 
 Emma : Really, I'm fine. 
 Trotwood : I know, I know, but you need to get some rest. 
 Come on, come on. 
 Everything's gonna be all right. 
 Leslie, I'm so sorry. 
 Could you wait out here for a moment, please? 
 Is she gonna be all right? 
 We both are... in spite of what you tried to do.

 If you ever try and hurt Emma again or do anything to come between us, there will be hell to pay. 
 Officer Trotwood, I can afford that price. 
 Can you?

 What's that for? 
 One final piece of business. 
 I told you. I'm done.

 Take that, or I find someone else. 
 What do I have to do? 
 I need you to save my family.

 I thought with all of today's events, you'd be asleep until tomorrow night. 
 Do you want me to read to you? 
 Did you put Benjamin where Leslie was sure to find him? 
 Of course not. Emma. 
 Why would I do such a thing? 
 To make me a monster. 
 To send him away. 
 You did, didn't you? 
 I'm gonna tell you the truth, but you have to promise... 
 Promise you won't hate me. 
 I couldn't live with that. 
 I considered doing something. 
 I was so jealous, and even now, the thought of what a life without you might portend frightens me. 
 But, no, no, I swear on Father's life, I'm... I'm not responsible for Leslie finding Benjamin. 
 I love you so much. 
 And I do want you to be happy.

 Somebody doing what? 
 Tampering with the transport wagon or intent on harming or helping Siringo in some way before or during the journey to Charlestown Prison. 
 And there's no chance that this was an accident? 
 None at all. 
 Trotwood was most definitely murdered.

 Not yet.

 This has to be the most cursed family I've ever known. 
 Lizzie : You remember when I was little, and Daddy got so angry at you for letting me ride Rosalie. 
 He was so afraid that I would fall off and get hurt, and I thought he was just being silly, because that's how I always was, so angry. 
 But I understand it now, with you like this. 
 I know what he was afraid of and why his fear made him violent. 
 Daddy lost his wife, and you lost Mama. 
 I lost all of you to grief before I ever even had a chance to know what love was, what a family was. 
 But I know it now. 
 I know it because of you. 
 You loved me. 
 [sniffles] 
 You took care of me and protected me. 
 I'm gonna take care of you and keep you safe and sound. 
 Forever. 
 I know you want that too. 
 I know that deep down you want that too.

 How did you get in here? 
 What do you want? 
 I did what you wanted. 
 We're done. 
 Yes, we are. 
 The money's not here, if that's what you want. 
 I wanted Mr. Trotwood's exit to be a bit more delicate. 
 You wanted a violin playing. 
 I wanted it to look like an accident. 
 He had the misfortune of accidently residing in the same town as you. 
 Isn't that enough? 
 Either I was unclear, or you're just consistently dense. 
 Either way, we're done. 
 What is it? 
 What did you do? 
 I cut my losses. 
 [groaning] 
 [growls] 
 Why? We had a deal. 
 Which you executed rather poorly, causing undue stress for someone I'm very close to. 
 Now, I want you to get some rest and think about your mistake and how you'll never make it again. 
 Good boy. 
 [dark music] 
 Good morning, Lizzie. 
 What is this? 
 This is me leaving. 
 What are you talking... Where are you going? 
 I'm done with death, Lizzie. 
 I'm done with Fall River, and I'm done with you. 
 You can do what you want with Benjamin's body. 
 It means nothing to me. 
 It's just a symbol of the tragedy and decay that's kept me by your side for so long now. 
 Emma... 
 You can't do this now. 
 Dr. Bowen gave you something last night. 
 It's confusing you... 
 I am more lucid and in control as I have ever been. 
 And I know that if either one of us is going to make it in this life, it has to be on her own. 
 Especially you. 
 No! 
 Me? I am making it just fine. 
 By removing any competition for my affection that crosses your path. 
 I told you, I had no intention... 
 You killed him. 
 Who, Leslie? 
 Benjamin. 
 My son. 
 The only person in this world who truly needed me. 
 No... 
 You made him sick. 
 You made him weak. 
 No! 
 You gave him something over time... 
 Stop it! 
 You really think that I'm capable of murdering your child? 
 I didn't before. 
 Emma. Emma, wait, you can't go! 
 Emma, I need you! 
 You need me like you need a mirror... to reflect you back to yourself to make you feel like you're not alone. 
 But you are alone, Lizzie. 
 You have always been alone. 
 And that, I now know, is the way you like it!

 It would diminish the sacrifice they've made for our happiness if I forgot them.

 Well, here's the thing, and... 
 [sighs] Well... 
 If you could possibly... 
 If you could find some way to make Emma come home... 
 I promise, I will never go beyond that number.
