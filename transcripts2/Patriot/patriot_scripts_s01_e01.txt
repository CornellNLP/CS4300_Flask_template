 With Bell-end Socket Welds. 
 On the outer farcs. 
 Inside, I don't like them. 
 What do you like inside? 
 Dell Yard 50s because of thermal expansion with nickel alloys. 
 How many fillet welds would you use in that scenario, John? 
 I would use two. 
 [writing] 
 200? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Of course, man. I'm sorry. 
 John, walk me through a scenario where you've contracted for cap ends. 
 You've got cracked L quadrants, and 40,000 gallons coming down the line. 
 What do you tell the engineer? 
 He's going to have to tie down his baker knots at every Lawrence crease besides the first and last. 
 Well, I hope he doesn't tie down his bakers because then he'd open his truss underbelly and crack every uncracked quad in the line. 
 Wow. 
 Let's try that one again. 
 Yeah, I don't know. Great recommendations. 
 His CV was strong, but I like the little Asian guy better. 
 This guy seems a little weird. 
 Yeah, and he was 10 minutes late. 
 That Stephen Tchoo was right on time. 
 That Stephen Tchoo. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You just interviewed for the process engineering job? 
 Yeah. You? 
 Yeah. Yeah. How'd it go? 
 Great. How about you? 
 Okay. 
 Not great. I blanked on a couple of things, a couple of basics. 
 Hey, it happens, man. Don't beat yourself up. 
 Yeah. So you think you'll take it if they offer? 
 What are you thinking? 
 I have some other offers. 
 But it's a pretty strong opportunity here. 
 So I'm pretty jacked. 
 Yeah. Good for you. 
 Hey, tomorrow's another day.

 Man : A helicopter crash in rural Iran will drastically alter their spring election. 
 Frontrunner Fashid Harmed and three others died this morning in Herat, leaving a field of two remaining candidates, neither of whom were once expected to win. 
 Edward, could you cancel your plans for this weekend? 
 Something has happened, and I'd like you to come over. 
 Is this not an opportunity to adopt a more moderate social and religious position? 
 Mr. Harmed, a moderate, was expected to win the election. 
 My political positions are functions of my faith. 
 My faith won't move. 
 If there's moving, men will come to me. 
 I would like to send someone over to get in front of this election. 
 Who? 
 We have few officers who've worked Iran over any meaningful term. 
 One has NOC. time in engineering covers. 
 He'll have to go in non-official. 
 But there's a concern. 
 Because? 
 It's my son, and it's complicated. 
 In what way? 
 [sigh] 
 Well, in one way, he records folk music under an assumed name because he says it helps him with his feelings, for example. That's one way. 
 That's, um... Really? 
 Hmm. The songs, oh, they're pretty good. 
 Um, I mean, I'm his dad, so maybe I'm biased, but they're pretty good, but they're becoming... more honest. 
 Which is probably a good thing for folk singers in general but not a good thing if you're one who works in intelligence. 
 But he's suited for this job, and he's excellent. 
 He's just... 
 I don't know, not like everybody else. 
 And he's had a tough year, and I'm worried about him. 
 How close are they? 
 To what? 
 To a practical nuclear capability? 
 It's going to happen... this winter, if they want it to happen.

 Hey, Efram, I got some news. 
 Can you roll down the window, buddy? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks, man. 
 You ready to camp, man? 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah, man. I was, too. 
 But we can't. 
 Yeah. I'm sorry. 
 Something has come up. 
 Uh, your mom is away, and she was expecting you and me to hang for a couple of days, so I'm going to drive you to your grandma's house. 
 Cool? 
 Uh, hey, are you... you... are you getting crumbs all over the place? 
 No. 
 Okay. Good. 
 Good. Don't. 
 Everything's all right. 
 I'm sorry to come by your work place like this, but it's important. 
 Is John okay? 
 He is. He is. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 But, Alice, I know you were expecting John home at the end of the month. 
 Are you sending him somewhere else, Tom? 
 He's not coming home, is he? 
 He will be home for a day or two, but then I'm sending him back to work, yeah. 
 But he's okay? 
 His last job was involved. 
 I know you were hoping to have John home, and I know that, uh, the two of you had a... well, a challenging year last year. 
 I should have come by more often. 
 I should have had you over for a beer or something. 
 So have me over next week. 
 Is there anything I can do for you two? 
 Ah, you know what? 
 I think we just need a couple of days off. 
 We just need to go for a drive or something. 
 I don't know. Could it be that simple? 
 I was married for 42 years, and yes, it can be that simple. 
 But it's not going to happen for a while. 
 Okay. 
 You take care of him. 
 I plan to.

 John, get out of the chute now!

 Let's go! 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. That thing's f*cked. I'm dead. 
 We'll tell him Memaw did it. 
 Grandma? 
 [chuckles] 
 Thank you for clearing the decks this weekend. 
 Of course. 
 Did you miss anything? 
 Uh, yeah. Beltway Buddies events... uh, camping. 
 That's their project where I foster and enrich a boy. 
 Yeah, Eddie, I know. 
 This is John's address. 
 Get John. Tell him I need him. 
 Come home. 
 I'm worried about him. He's been gone a while. 
 Absolutely, I will get him home. 
 Hey. 
 I wanted to ask you. 
 No reason. It just crosses my mind from time to time. 
 When you and John were younger, Eddie... 
 Yeah? 
 I have always wondered. 
 Did my 92-year-old mother really remove from its case and then just completely f*cking demolish my Sony VX3 video camera? 
 Yes. 
 And you're sure you and John weren't just f*cking around with it, doing something stupid? 
 No. Memaw did it. 
 She was country strong. 
 [honking] 
 Go bring your brother home. 
 Take care of him if you need to. 
 Will do. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, brother, you want to go for a walk? 
 [snicker] 
 She was their nanny. 
 Did they like her? 
 Not at first. 
 But soon, soon they learned that she could do some very fun and interesting things. 
 Like what? 
 Like fly with her umbrella. 
 They lived in London, which is a very big city in England. 
 Woman : He jumped off the f*cking roof with a f*cking umbrella! 
 He broke his feet, Edward! 
 Both f*cking feet! 
 All right. 
 And his ankles! 
 He's supposed to be camping! 
 All right. 
 With you! 
 You just left him with his grandmother? 
 I can't believe you're a Congressman! 
 That's scary! 
 All right. 
 Now you just get back here! 
 All right, I will come. 
 I don't care where the f*ck you are! 
 I said I would come home, Carol. 
 I'm coming right now. Jeez. 
 I have to go. 
 My Little Buddy broke his feet and his ankles. 
 That was his mom. My little special friend? 
 Anyway, Dad needs you home tonight. 
 You got the message. 
 I don't know. 
 What don't you know? 
 I'm competing tonight. 
 Oh, you're competing. I'm sorry. 
 In what? 
 Mechanical bull contest. 
 It's how I've been making extra money. 
 I'm saving up for a bike trip, a long trip. 
 They're really big out here, for some reason, mechanical bulls. 
 5,000 bucks if I win. 
 Listen, brother, it's going to be different this time. 
 All you got to do is bring a bag of money, A to B, John, and then make sure it gets doled out right over a few months. That's it. 
 It's never easy like that. 
 It always gets messed up. 
 Okay, Dad says he needs you. 
 That's pretty easy to understand, right? 
 Yeah... 
 I'm leaning toward just staying here, ride this fake bull, get that money, and then have Alice come out and bike across Spain with me. 
 We'll look at some Spanish birds. 
 Hmm. Spanish birds. 
 Huh. 
 You're so weird. 
 Cantar Walley's a terrorist, right? 
 And he might be the next President of Iran. 
 And Dad said that he wouldn't call you if he didn't need you. 
 Well, this one tonight... bull ride... it's the final, so... there won't be another money ride for six months. 
 So I don't know. 
 Maybe... Maybe I'll go back if I lose tonight. 
 Who... Who do you even compete against anyway? 
 It's a pretty international city. 
 There's guys from all over. 
 Are any of these other competitors from Texas, like you? 
 No. 
 So you usually win. 
 Yeah. 
 What time is this thing? 
 And are there any hot European girls there usually? 
 Because I can maybe squeeze that in before my flight.

 Nice. Make a whole 360, you know? 
 We're going to try to buy this election, John, for the other guy. 
 We're going to spread a lot of money all across Iran, across all 30 provinces. 
 We got the guy to do that. 
 We just need you to get him the money and then come and go from Iran in the fall to make sure that it gets to where we need it. 
 How? 
 N.O.C. 
 I thought you were looking. 
 You looked like you were looking. 
 McMillan is an oil infrastructure engineering firm. 
 This project's gonna play out in two places: Iran and Luxembourg. 
 We need to bank with these people in Luxembourg because their money is worthless, and the Iranians we need don't use their own banks. 
 McMillan comes and goes both places. 
 Hey, John. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you getting any of this? 
 I'm getting all of it. 
 Money, Luxembourg, Iran. 
 Buy an election. 
 Yeah, that's all. 
 Luxembourg's the only country in Europe that does business with Iran, so all the money comes and goes through there. 
 McMillan travels both places routinely, so that's your mark. 
 You interview in Milwaukee on Wednesday. 
 The physicist guy wants 10 million. 
 It's been difficult to pay him, though, because of the sanctions. 
 But they're going to find a way to pay him right quick if Walley wins.

 Hey.

 Oh, cool. Hey, Dennis McClaren, conforming. 
 Cool. 
 Can I talk to you about something? 
 Listen, I'm in a situation. 
 Hey, can you not pee for a sec? 
 Can I not what? 
 Don't pee. 
 [whistling] 
 My name's John, but my last name's not Lakeman. 
 I am interviewing for a position in process design, but I'm also an intelligence officer. 
 Don't pee, please. Are you peeing, Dennis? 
 No. 
 [whispering] I need this job because I have to work in accredited construction overseas to go places Americans aren't supposed to. 
 Okay. 
 Without leaving a trail. 
 Okay. 
 Luxembourg. 
 Yeah. 
 Iran. 
 Yeah, we go there. 
 Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here. 
 I have to hand over some money in Luxembourg and then be in Iran. 
 I can hear you peeing, man. 
 I'm sorry, man. That's because I started a little before, and it's hard to stop. 
 Uh, if you could... maybe hurry it up or make it shorter or something. 
 I have to oversee the distribution of hard money across Iran, just to stop Israel from being f*cked up, basically. 
 McMillan's the only company that banks where they bank, that works on the ground in Iran. 
 I'm not going to pass this urine test, so I need yours.

 You're meeting with Tim Peetnam. 
 He chairs the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. 
 He's going to ask you on. 
 I asked him to. 
 I need you to be near John when he's in Iran and in Luxembourg, I guess, for now. 
 Okay. 
 You'll be able to come and go on that committee as an attaché. 
 Attaché? 
 You know, your dad and I came up together in Congress. 
 When he moved to state, I was pleased you ran for his seat. 
 Oh. It was an honor. 
 I'd be glad to have you on the subcommittee. 
 I was hoping you'd take an attaché role in Nonproliferation. 
 With pleasure. 
 I'm looking forward to making a difference on that front as an attaché. 
 I served with your dad... Army Infantry 52... as well... 
 Do I get a badge? 
 Get a what? 
 Do I get an attaché badge? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't think we have those. 
 Right. 
 What if I made my own? 
 Well, it would be weird, but I guess you could. 
 I don't know. 
 Do you know where we're flying out of? 
 Did you know the 500 euro is the preferred currency of the underworld? 
 You want to draw the blinds there, buddy? 
 I asked you a question. 
 I asked you if you know where we're flying out of. 
 You are flying out of Terminal 6B, corporate terminal, at Milwaukee Airport. 
 Private terminal? 
 Yep. There's no screener. 
 You just get on. 
 You're certain? 
 Because if I have to check it for some reason... 
 They do random screens of bags at intervals, so someone could see into this bag on the other side, even if I check it. 
 That could happen if I let it out of my hands, and there's a lot of money in this bag. 
 You carry it with you on the plane, John. 
 Look, you're not going to have any problems. 
 We cased the corporate logs for 36 months. 
 You're flying private. 
 Oh, and your father told me to tell you keep it safe. 
 We can't just send more bags. 
 It's not the 1980s. 
 This bag has to get where it's going. 
 What's the latest with the Asian kid? 
 I went to see him on behalf of McMillan. 
 He's suffering from closed head trauma. 
 Struggling to form words. 
 And he's permanently lost his sense of humor. 
 All in all, he's looking pretty normal. 
 But he's not normal. 
 No. He got hit by a f*cking truck. 
 He talks like he's 6. 
 But he's fighting it. 
 Should have looked both ways. 
 Hey, Leslie, we flying Delta? 
 No. United. 
 God damn it. 
 What? 
 We talked about that, Leslie. 
 I said Delta from now on whenever possible. 
 They have more attractive stewardesses. 
 Aren't we leaving from the private terminal? 
 No. 
 We only fly private when there are multiple legs. 
 That's regular company policy. 
 Straight shots, we fly commercial. 
 What, commercial's not good enough for you, Lakeman? 
 Of course. 
 Yeah. 
 Any time you're ready, there, Lakeman. 
 I'm going to have to check this bag. 
 It's getting a little heavy. 
 I'll be right with you.

 He probably won't have an alarm. 
 Guy's front door might even be open. 
 He has five brothers, by the way. 
 I don't need his biography. 
 I just need the address, Ron. 
 They all live at that address, John. 
 I thought you might want to know there could be six men in the house. 
 They're Brazilian. Brazilians constitute most of the labor force in Luxembourg.

 I just wanted you to know that. 
 Dennis, I just look at numbers sometimes. 
 It's like accounting. 
 John, I know you can't really tell because I have to wear a suit all the time, but I'm ripped. 
 Maybe I can be a big help. 
 That's all. 
 That's so you know I'm not full of sh1t. 
 I know it's kind of last minute, but do you have any Japanese girls? 
 Great. Just maybe to accompany me to dinner. 
 Okay. Great. 
 Or maybe to whip the back of my legs with a Twizzler. 
 Dennis. 
 Oh, hey, John. 
 I'm just going for a walk to get my head together for this meeting tonight. 
 Go away, man. You did your part. 
 I peed in a cup. 
 Great job, man. It's good work. 
 Really helped me out, but right now you're really kind of f*cking me up here. 
 I like you, but go away. 
 Okay? I like you, but seriously, go away now. 
 John. 
 I got two kids. They're okay. 
 Yeah, they're okay, but man, my wife and my job... 
 Come on. That's it. 
 That's my whole life? Piping? 
 Let me do some recon. 
 Recon? 
 Yeah. 
 Dennis, if you keep following me, I'm going to stab you in the thigh. 
 John, I can be a huge help... Ohh! 
 Don't go to the hospital.

 Go f*ck them up. Go get them. 
 [speaking French] 
 Thank you. 
 [panting] 
 Hey, man. 
 Hi. 
 There's a clean shirt in here. 
 Jesus. 
 Got your little suit, guy? 
 You're 40 minutes late. 
 There was something I... 
 You were supposed to go over our entire shipping order tonight, okay? 
 With Dennen. 
 It ships tomorrow, for Christ's sake. 
 You're off to a shitty start here, son, I don't mind saying. 
 It won't happen again. 
 That's not the McMillan way. 
 Thanks for having me at Open Mic Night. 
 I hope that's what the sign says. 
 Uh, any requests? 
 Okay, I'll just... I'll just play something I've been working on tonight in my head.

 Thank you. Good night. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, that's cool, man. 
 Yeah. 
 They make us carry those at all times. 
 West Noble 990. 
 When I got to Milwaukee, when I interviewed, the Bureau report said the office was at 990 West Noble. 
 It's East Noble. 
 And my... my cover car never came. 
 I had to run. I was late. 
 I nearly lost the job, and then it just... it got more f*cked from there. 
 [sigh] 
 Hey. 
 I know you're not doing great, but you're going to be okay. 
 I'm here. I'm always going to be here. 
 Okay? 
 There's your badge. 
 Thank you. 
 [speaking French] 
 Monsieur Lakeman, someone left a note this morning for you. 
 Ron : Yeah. It's Portuguese. 
 The note says "The cost of not killing you, Lakeman, "or talking to the police about you, Lakeman, is the garment bag, the Barros Brothers." 
 Okay, the bag transfer's in 20 minutes, John. 
 Only English, okay? 
 Because I'm going to America. 
 What's America? 
 Another country. 
 Like Luxembourg? 
 Oh, no. Luxembourg would fit in her pocket. 
 It would get lost in her purse. 
 Why are you going? 
 My work. 
 What do you do at work? 
 Sometimes, when we make pastries, you take your sister's from her when you think she's not watching, Myna. 
 She gets mad. 
 Oui. She gets mad because it's not nice. 
 Well, sometimes... a person will take another person's life. 
 Their whole life? 
 Yes. 
 They take their whole life. 
 So I'm flying to America, to Milwaukee, America, to learn who took someone else's whole life. 
 John. 
 I can take that from you now. 
 Thank you. 
 Male voice : Thank you. 
 The cleric is indebted to you. 
 Leave your hotel tomorrow. 
 You'll transfer the bag to El-Mashad on the19th. 
 [line clicks] 
 I'm going to be asking a lot of you, it seems like, this year, Edward. 
 Oh. Um... 
 Um, yeah, Dad, about John? 
 Yes. 
 Oh. Then yeah, for sure. 
 Why for sure? 
 Um, because it's family. 
 So that's for sure. It's family. 
 You'll do everything, in that case. 
 Yeah. Yes. 
 Mm-hmm. And I can count on that? 
 Yeah. Go ahead. 
 Count on it. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 That word means a lot to me, Edward. 
 Because everything else is just bullshit. 
 [muttering] 
 Hey, Efram... you know how your mom sometimes talks to me like... 
 I don't know, like... like I am your dad, maybe, like she'll yell at me a lot, like, so much that it would be weird if we were just Beltway Buddies. 
 Anyway, I think that... that could be... that might be kind of confusing for you, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well, do you want to hear a... a bedtime story that'll hopefully maybe clear that up? 
 Awesome. 
 Okay. 
 Once upon a time... there was a Congressman who liked to dance. 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 We can, uh, we'll call him Cool Rick. 
 And Cool Rick went out dancing in a D.C. area nightclub, and he met, uh, this woman. Let's call her... well, uh, we... we can call her Your Mom. 
 Okay? And Your Mom was a really great dancer, and she did all kinds of things that Cool Rick did not expect as he was getting to know her, like make him laugh. 
 And have a baby. 
 But, see, Cool Rick is a Congressman for just assholes who are stupid as sh1t, and they live in this shitty place called Bridgerose, Texas, and they do not like guys like Cool Rick who have children when they're not married, so even if he was, um, really your dad, he couldn't tell anyone. 
 But Cool Rick loves you... so much, man. 
 [beep] 
 Male voice : Tom, the guy we gave the bag to, not executing the plan. 
 And Tom, listen. 
 There is an indication that this involves a physicist they're recruiting. 
 Tom, you may have gotten conned. 
 We might have handed the bag to the cleric. 
 [line clicks] 
 [whispering] So I just wanted to know. 
 Did something happen in Luxembourg? 
 I checked the paper last night online. 
 I read someone was killed. 
 The Luxembourg paper? 
 Yeah. The Wort. 
 Do... Do you have to pay and sign up for that? 
 Did you have to pay for that? 
 Like, half the article is free, and I had to get it monthly for the other half, but, John, I went to the hospital that night. 
 That's why I brought it up. 
 I'm sorry. I went. 
 It was just... It was too close to my dick. 
 I think you grazed one of my testicles, and I just... I freaked. 
 I went. I know you told me not to go, but I didn't know that you were going to stab a Brazilian guy. 
 And this morning a detective called from Luxembourg... 
 This lady. Because I got stabbed the same night in Luxembourg. 
 Let's talk about this tomorrow. 
 Okay. Cool. 
 Leslie. 
 Uh, Leslie, I... I wanted to apologize, Leslie, for the Dennen meeting in Luxembourg. 
 I know we go back in a week. 
 I assure you I'll make a much better impression on Dennen then. 
 I'm not sure that we're bringing you back to Luxembourg, Lakeman. 
 I'm not sure that you're still on the traveling squad, son. 
 We'll see. 
 Maybe you'll stay here, get your piping in order. 
 [stammering] Hey, man. Remember me? 
 I'm Stephen. 
 Slow down, Stephen. 
 W-We met before. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, what... what are you doing... 
 McMillan wanted me to come in and work on your processing slates because they suck. 
 That's good. 
 You're the process engineer, right? 
 I don't remember much of our conversation. 
 I had an accident. 
 Stephen will get his memory back over time, if he does his exercises and finishes his full therapy program. 
 Later, man. 
 Later. 
 [phone ringing] 
 Hello. 
 Tom : Not quite the in and out we expected. 
 No, not really. 
 Our guy, the bag, gone. 
 He never landed in Iran. 
 He doesn't seem to have left Luxembourg. 
 El-Mashad, physicist, waiting for his 10 million euros, he just bought a plane ticket to Luxembourg. 
 I think the cleric's behind this. 
 The cleric played us, John. 
 El-Mashad and that bag can't get together. 
 We go back in a week. 
 I'll be there. 
 Goodbye, son. 
 Also... you keep parking in my f*cking parking spot.
