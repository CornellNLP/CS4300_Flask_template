 Hey, Jill. 
 How you doing? 
 Uh, hope you're having a great day. 
 Um, I am. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah. Um... 
 Oh, good news. 
 I'm going to be hitting you up with that child support payment that was... that I actually sent to you but was actually lost, apparently. 
 So that'll be coming your way, so that's... that's great. 
 Um... 
 Hey, you know, I've been thinking... reminiscing... about how we all used to go kayaking on that little river near your mom's. 
 Best family times ever. 
 Oh, and also, oh, ah, I want to give you a heads up about the phone bill. 
 Th-They're saying that yours is late... uh, the one that I was supposed to keep paying. 
 Well, I'm on top of it, and, um, you know, I don't expect any problems on your end. 
 [click, beeping] 
 [female voice, in Dutch] _ 
 Hello? 
 [click, beeping] 
 Come on. 
 F. 
 [sigh] 
 Ohh... 
 [engine fails to turn over] 
 [fails to turn over] 
 [fails to turn over] 
 F. 
 Thank you. 
 So you can see that she's in good shape. 
 Seaworthy. 
 When you gestured down this kayak, you changed hands, but you kept... you always kept one of your hands covering the same portion of the kayak. 
 Did I? 
 Yes. 
 Hmm. 
 Now you're trying to look casual, like you're just standing there, but you're still covering up the same portion of the kayak while you're just standing there. 
 Am I? 
 May I see that portion? 
 Well, it's not a big thing. 
 I... I need to see it. 
 It's not a big crack. 
 I-It's just a surface thing. 
 And it's as advertised. 
 I need to see it. 
 It's as advertised. 
 As I said, it's... it's gently loved. 
 In my Craig List... 
 I'm not buying this f*cking kayak until you move away from that area. 
 Man : ...additional sort of overhand technique, so we'll begin with a loop, and one of the advantages is that it can undergo intense shock loading, so what we'll have you do is make a loop, and then we're going to make an additional loop. 
 We've got one here and then one here, so... I sort of think of it as... as an upper loop and a lower loop, and then what we'll have to do is take the remaining slack here and begin wrapping. 
 So you're going to be wrapping up towards the bottom loop here. 
 As you can see, while I'm pulling this end, it's tightening that loop and locking it in. 
 [Man speaking Dutch] 
 Most likely, you'd want a little more of that tilt there.

 Hey, want to go to a ball game on Sunday? 
 Nationals? Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Because we can sit in the handicapped section now. 
 It's right behind home plate. 
 Cool. 
 Woman : Canada closed its embassy in Iran today and ordered all Iranian diplomatic staff out of Canada. The statement read, "Canada sees Iran as the world's most significant threat to global peace and security." 
 And some of the... 
 Why are we sitting on... 
 What is this? 
 Air mattress. 
 Why are we sitting on an air mattress? 
 There's nowhere else to sit. 
 They were supposed to get this place outfitted. 
 Yeah. 
 It would look better outfitted. 
 Well, yeah. 
 I'm going to fire somebody. 
 Okay. Maybe get me a chair, too. 
 Uh, well, yeah. 
 So... 
 Don't worry about the detective. 
 You'll stall it. 
 Get back on the travel team. 
 Get back to Luxembourg before the physicist. 
 All I have to worry about for now. 
 It's his wife. 
 He's sending her to get the money. 
 She's flying for the first time in her life. 
 Get there before her. 
 While you're here in Milwaukee, catch your breath. 
 Rest, gather yourself, and then get that bag. 
 Cantar Walley. 
 He figured out how to get the cash they need to get their program active... active pretty much from the day he'd take office. 
 He got it from us. 
 We have to get it to where we intended. 
 There are things in his past... 
 Well, he would be a terrifying long-term adversary. 
 He's intelligent. 
 He's resolute He understands the U.S. 
 He spent some time here. 
 Doing what? 
 Competing in the world championships of "Battleship" as a kid. 
 That little game? 
 Yeah. 
 Against adults. 
 B3. 
 [speaking Spanish] _ 
 What do you have to do to get back on the travel team? 
 Shore up my piping. 
 Stop pissing this guy off... a guy named Leslie. 
 Hmm. 
 Hey, man. 
 Hey, Dennis. 
 John, I spoke to this detective... 
 [door opens] 
 ...last night. 
 She called. She wants to interview me. 
 She wants to come interview me, man. 
 f*ck. What? 
 We'll talk about that at the bar after work. 
 Hey, Lakeman. 
 You got the memo? 
 They've moved divisional parking into a crummy lot now for some reason. 
 Yeah. 
 I know you did because you parked there this morning. 
 Yeah. 
 But... 
 Yeah? 
 Same spots. 
 What? 
 We've maintained the same spots. 
 C19. 
 Still mine. 
 That's on the memo. 
 And you still park there. 
 Seriously, C19. 
 That's a letter, a number stenciled on the curb of my reserved parking space in which this morning you parked once again. 
 And in which, if you park tomorrow, I'll fire you. 
 Okay? 
 Got it. 
 [fly zips up] 
 Do you? 
 Because you said that yesterday. 
 Lakeman. 
 Yeah, Leslie. 
 Are you a McMillan man? 
 Oh, man, yeah. 
 [flush] 
 f*ck. 
 The bar after work. 
 [flush] 
 Good morning, co-workers. I'm Ally O'Donhaill. 
 I'm Stephen Tchoo's therapy companion. 
 Thanks for playing a part in young Stephen's recovery, and that part is just to be tolerant of his challenges and limitations. 
 First an update. 
 Stephen's doing great on his cognitive tasks. 
 Not so good at things like social processing, which he should really get better at because we've worked on it a lot already, right, Stephen? 
 I don't have to tell you that again, okay, Stephen? 
 Okay. 
 Co-workers, Stephen can quickly do complicated math. 
 It's weird, right? 
 But he might have problems, say, opening his laptop or turning on faucets. 
 Uh, Stephen's impulse inhibitors were bruised, so there's going to be some locker room talk, maybe some touching, for a time. 
 Patience plays a big part here. 
 Co-workers, have you seen Rocky? 
 Sure. It's a great one, right? 
 Well, Stephen, here, is going to run right up those steps just like Rocky, for whom, if you remember, wasn't so easy that old first time. 
 Well, there's a lot of hard work in the middle there that they skip over in the movie because it's tedious and painful and grueling. 
 Stephen's going to be in that phase for a long time. 
 Good luck, son. 
 If you could actually try not to speak to Stephen directly unless he's prepared for it. 
 Like he should be looking at you, like right at you, before you speak to him, or you might startle him. 
 Okay. Sorry. 
 Yeah, you can just come right up and tell him that personally. 
 Just make sure he's prepared first. 
 Oh, it's... 
 Is he prepared? 
 You can ask him that directly. 
 Are you prepared? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's cool. 
 And that's all there is to it. 
 Leslie. 
 What are the terms of my situation, my working situation with Stephen? 
 You're both going to perform essentially the same tasks more or less until we determine who's better at them. 
 Like, right next to each other? 
 Yes. 
 So do you need me to say much more? 
 No. I get it, Tom. 
 And we were able to help you with it. 
 It's not easy to investigate Americans if it was instigated overseas. 
 We've made things difficult for your European detective. 
 I'm gonna do more along those lines this afternoon. 
 Carlson. 
 Thank you. 
 Tom, get out of here. 
 Come on. How many times have we done this? 
 Oh, that's game. 
 [man speaking French] _ 
 [men laughing] 
 Man : He's right over there. 
 Ally : Oh, good. Thank you. 
 Um, sir, didn't you agree to open Stephen's laptop? 
 Oh. Yeah. Sorry. 
 That was two hours ago. 
 I got a lot going on at the moment. 
 Well, Stephen suffered a close brain trauma, so I guess he's got a lot going on, too. 
 Leslie : Denon's in Thursday to cover our Iran implement. 
 We're going to task off today and prep for them. 
 John, let's give you Field 4. 
 You should have covered some of this ground in Luxembourg, but you f*cked that up. 
 But they're still on the hook. 
 Now don't overpromise this week. 
 Sell them on the structure. 
 You can talk about it with confidence. 
 Keep it simple. Little something like this, John: Hey, let me walk you through our Donnely nut spacing and cracked system rim-riding grip configuration. 
 Using a field of half-seized sprats and brass-fitted nickel slits, our bracketed caps and splay-flexed brace columns vent dampers to dampening hatch depths of 1/2 meter from the damper crown to the spurv plinth. 
 How? Well, we bolster 12 Husk Nuts to each girdle jerry, while flex tandems press a task apparatus of ten vertically composited patch hamplers, then pin flam-fastened pan traps at both maiden apexes of the jimjoints. 
 Little something like that, Lakeman. 
 Are you a Mr. Lakeman? 
 I'm, uh... Yeah. 
 Mr. Lakeman, I'm Gregory Gordon. Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Mr. Lakeman, I work in HR, and I'm trying to process your first paycheck. 
 Cool. 
 Uh, it would be cool, but I can't. 
 There's an issue. A small issue. 
 Your I-9. 
 Your Social Security number, well... 
 Yeah? 
 You have too many numbers. 
 I'm sorry? 
 You have an extra digit. 
 Well, that's not... that's not the way it's supposed to be. 
 No. You're supposed to have the normal amount. 
 Of numbers. 
 Which is nine. 
 And I have ten? 
 Yes. 
 I'll come by with my card. 
 No, you see, we have a photocopy of your card. 
 There's just too many digits on your card. 
 I don't know how you've been using it all these years. 
 It's unusual. 
 This is the last place you remember standing. 
 Yes. 
 Just smell the air for something familiar from the day you were injured, Stephen. 
 Anything familiar? 
 No. 
 I combed my own hair today. 
 One thing at a time. Don't brag. 
 Hey, man. 
 Hey. 
 Anything familiar? 
 There's maybe... 
 No. 
 Don't say no, Stephen. Say "not yet." 
 Not yet. 
 You take girdle... grit-rim jammers... grit-girdle jimmer jerries. 
 f*ck. 
 D6. 
 [speaking Finnish] _ 
 [man speaking Egyptian] _ 
 
 
 
 Alice : What can I tell you that's new? 
 Uh, I'm working on a new app. 
 Uh, this one... this one is different than that last one. 
 This one could work. 
 You use it in traffic if you're thinking about letting a car cut in front of you. 
 You aim your phone at them, and it tells you whether they're going to thank you or not. 
 Based on certain algorithms that I don't know, um, or... 
 Working hard there, Lakeman? 
 4:45. 
 We generally take it all the way to 5 here, John, FYI. 
 Sorry, Leslie. 
 I think maybe my watch is wrong. 
 You know what I think? 
 I think maybe something else is wrong around here. 
 C19. 
 John, can we deal with this interview thing? 
 I've been all afternoon hyperventilating. 
 Hey. 
 Yeah? 
 What does John do? 
 [laughing] 
 We're not supposed to talk about that. 
 Come on. 
 Okay, but he called me from somewhere. 
 He's never done that before. 
 I saw him. 
 I was with him. 
 Is he okay? 
 I can't say, Alice, for certain. 
 You mean you don't know, or you're not allowed to tell me because you're a Tavner? 
 You know why I'm wearing this? 
 That weird green suit? 
 Mm. This era-authentic Beastie Boys licensed Il Tour top and sweats. 
 Oh. No, I... I don't know why you're wearing that. 
 MCA died Friday. 
 Yeah. That was sad. 
 Yeah. It was sad. 
 Part of me died, too. 
 Just a little part. 
 Little cool part. 
 See, Dad and John, they always had their thing. 
 But I'm not musical in that way. 
 I'm not musical in the way that I can play music. 
 I'm musical in the way that I like beats and fun-loving rhymes. 
 But Dad? Not into it at all. 
 But you know what, Alice? 
 When I was 11, he took me to the Summit Arena in Houston for this tour. 
 And he wasn't that old then, but he was bald already, and he was the oldest guy there anyway by, like, a mile. 
 And the Beastie Boys had this huge, um, inflatable dick on the stage. 
 No, seriously. 
 And they thought... 
 It was, like, 9 feet, and they thought it was really funny to sort of, um... poke Dad with it for, like, the whole show. 
 It was the best. 
 Oh, man. 
 And Dad just endured it with a smile. 
 He just good sported it, you know? 
 The whole night. 
 He never said we had to leave. 
 But what did that story have to do with what we're talking about? 
 Because even though we may be different from each other, I am a Tavner. 
 Yeah. 
 And I'm not going to talk about what John does. 
 Would you tell me if he wasn't okay, Eddie? 
 It's important. 
 What is? 
 What John's doing. 
 Listen. 
 I know that... right now he's in a normal, safe place, Alice. 
 What am I going to say if she interviews me, John? 
 What did you say at the hospital? 
 That's not a problem. I... I was vague. 
 I didn't raise suspicion. 
 I remember exactly what I said. 
 I said a slight and stocky man or woman stabbed me in the thigh and then ran off to the right or left. 
 You won't have to interview. 
 It's being taken care of. 
 Ohh. 
 Dennis. 
 What's a McMillan man? 
 I have to be one in a week. 
 A McMillan man... piping, that's part of it. 
 Um, but there's other stuff, too, like beer. 
 You know, you don't drink enough. 
 And you're not married. 
 That's weird. 
 Uh, no offense. 
 It's just it's weird here. 
 Are you married in real life? 
 I can't. 
 I'm married. 
 Yeah. You were telling me. 
 That's right. 
 That's right, right before you stabbed me. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I'm f*cking married, so... 
 Listen. Hey. 
 I'm going to help you out. 
 We can take care of this. 
 Thanks, man. 
 Any progress on that paperwork, John? 
 Not as yet. 
 Keep me posted. 
 Will do. 
 I need you to do something for me. 
 What, Birdbath? 
 I need you to steal some sh1t from some Vietnam veterans later and then some other stuff. 
 What? 
 Yeah, two other things that are connected to that. 
 That's crazy, man. 
 Yeah? 
 Is it? 
 Do it anyway. 
 f*ck you, Birdbath. 
 You like to say my name... 
 Birdbath, my inelegant last name. 
 You do it a lot. It must give you some pleasure, John. 
 I got a lot going on, man. 
 You should lay off. 
 Oh, you got some important sh1t, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 And I'm taking up your time... 
 Jack Birdbath, oaf. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, this is important to me, what I'm telling you to do, so do my important sh1t, and then I'll let you do yours. 
 You're taking me away from something dire, Birdbath. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 And I got some piping sh1t that I need to figure out today, which you probably don't think is crucial, you big, dumb f*ck. 
 But it is. 
 The pool at the Y in 20 minutes. 
 And don't get all sentimental. 
 Woman : Everybody, underwater treadmill. 
 We're going to try to hold it for 15 seconds. 
 Let's go. 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
 Okay. 
 [gasping, coughing] 
 Using a grid of... f*ck. 
 Woman : Before we begin your deposition, could you make a statement that sets the table concerning the events of May 2012? 
 I had worked for eight years at that point... uh, up until that point... to keep the country of Iran from a nuclear capability. 
 That was a primary task. 
 That was a principal task of mine during that period. 
 And in May... May 2012, I instigated a series of events that... would have not just allowed that but would have paid for it. 
 ...half-seized sprats... 
 It's just the McMillan way. 
 Half... Half-seized sprats. 
 Odd bracketed caps and... split-flex breeze columns fan... dampeners to damper... 
 f*ck. 
 [birds wings flap] 
 f*ck. 
 Hey. 
 John, I don't sleep. 
 You're never gonna get any drop on me. 
 I heard everything you had to say to the dipshit in the bathroom. 
 Do what I ask, of I'll break the news. 
 You get it? 
 Birdbath : The dog's name is Charlie. 
 John : So what? 
 So when you take the f*cking dog, you say "Here, Charlie. Here, boy." 
 You'll have a rapport. 
 Charlie? 
 A police department? 
 It's just an evidence room. 
 Police protected. 
 I stand trial in two weeks for something I'm sure somebody told you about. 
 People like talking all about it. 
 I need you to put something in an evidence box. 
 I need you to get it in there tonight. 
 I need you to put this box in the other box. 
 How do you expect me to get in there? 
 It's not Fort Knox. 
 I've been helping you all day. 
 You don't know it. 
 What do you know about Milwaukee? 
 Same as anybody. 
 It's an ice box. 
 Sun hardly shines. 
 Our economy's factory-based, dwindling since the '60s. 
 Endemic violent crime in Milwaukee. 
 Because the premiums were too costly, our police insurance pulled the most vulnerable and harmed police off the street... the slow-witted, the overweight, the twerps, the little ones, the tiny cops, John. 
 This city did that, this goddamn place, and they stashed them in the evidence room. 
 So I'm saying you may have to fight off a tiny policemen tonight. 
 You can do it, big boy. 
 One guy looks normal... Glen Purdue... 
 But he has PTSD. 
 That was his calming dog you took off with... Charlie. 
 So anyway, with Glen, it all got a little too dark for him, and he snapped. 
 So you pretty much just want to make a really loud noise. 
 He'll probably find a corner and hug his knees. 
 [honk] 
 Aah! 
 [panting] 
 Charlie. 
 What the f*ck! 
 What the f*ck, m*therf*cker! 
 Let me down! 
 Aah!

 Edward : Just tell them. 
 No. 
 Come on. 
 No. 
 Efram is nearby. 
 Just call it something else. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Just call it a pickle. 
 Yeah. 
 Come on, Tom. 
 Tell it. It's a good one. 
 Okay. 
 It's big. 
 What? 
 It was a big pickle? 
 Gigantic pickle. 
 It's not my kind of thing, to start with, but, uh, it was, uh, I mean, I was actually enjoying it. 
 I mean, they're talented youngsters. 
 And then I see them conspiring, all three of them, about me. 
 Then they begin to make their way over toward me with the pickle, and the first thing, they just press the tip of the pickle up against... 
 Carol : No. 
 ...the side of my face, as if it were giving me a little kiss. 
 I was like, Okay... 
 Oh, my God, I loved it. 
 I loved it. 
 [Carol laughing] 
 He kept his cool, though. 
 This guy never lost his temper, even with that big dick in his face. 
 Carol : Hey! 
 Could you guys just give me a minute, please? 
 Man : Meanwhile, in Iran, the Conservative Alliance's presidential candidate Cantar Walley has seen his recent surge of popular support bolstered by an endorsement from Iran's Assembly of Experts. 
 Mr. Walley, a harsh critic of the West, slid well ahead of the opposition in the new nationwide polls by a margin of nearly 2-1. 
 As news of the Assembly's backing... 
 [glass shatters] 
 ...continues to spread across the country, regents said... 
 Cantar Walley : F9.

 [John's voice plays indistinctly] 
 [chatter] 
 Splay-flexed brace columns and... dam... damaged... d-dampened damps. 
 Icabod. 
 You want to see something cool? 
 Yeah, I want to see something cool. 
 Lakeman is going to park in my space again today. 
 I parked way off there, left my space wide open. 
 See if he parks in it. 
 If he does, I'm going to fire him. 
 That is cool. 
 You want to watch? 
 Sure. 
 I'm jacked about this. 
 You're hard. 
 Ahh. 
 It's not just that. 
 His Luxembourg numbers were all f*cked up. 
 I had to bring back that nice little Asian kid to shore up his piping. 
 Alice : And hey, if you're missing me, uh, well, I wanted to make a little something special for you... if you are, so... 
 I made this in bed, uh, last night. 
 I recorded myself... you know. Okay? 
 Just in case you were missing me.
