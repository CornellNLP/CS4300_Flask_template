 Charlie : You know how they say "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"? 
 Well, I'm up to 495 kills in "World of Warfare." 
 Not to brag, but my coma kind of made me a superhero. 
 That's the thing... the really great superheroes, they all rise from catastrophe. 
 The Axis of Evil threatening the planet made Wonder Woman rise up. 
 The Hulk was born out of a radiation spill, and he became the strongest man on the planet. 
 Bruce Wayne's parents were shot down in front of him in cold blood, and he became Batman. 
 Kal-El's world exploded... literally... and he became Superman. 
 Something to think about when things look their darkest. 
 Another great thing about superheroes? 
 They always get the girl. Hold on. Hold on. What's wrong? I can't breathe. [Gasping] Okay, I'm fine. [Chuckles] Oh, shh, shh, shh. I think I hear someone coming. [Metal jingles] Like I told you, no one ever comes into this place. Okay. [Chuckles] [Door opens, closes] Whoa! Aaaaaaah! Oh, God! Oh, my God! [Screaming] Oh, God! Oh, God! [Coughing, gasping] Kenji : Are you crazy? You know better than to swap spit with another cystic fibrosis patient. All right, maybe I am crazy...  Crazy for love. Lovesick, blinded by the light... Okay, stop trying to distract Kenji with '80s song lyrics. You and Mae should not be in the same room, let alone in a morgue. In our defense, the supply closet was locked. Okay, that is no excuse. You know what? This is a democracy, all right? Love will find its way. I'll text you. Text me! You'll never keep us apart. Yeah. [Chuckles] [Door closes] We'll never keep them apart. I think we're gonna have to slaughter them. Uh... that might be a little extreme. No, I don't mean literally slaughter them. I mean, we're gonna have to Jimmy slaughter them. See, when my mom found out that I went to third base with Jimmy slaughter, she bombarded me with all these disgusting bodily facts to keep me from going to home base. Did it work? For about a week. Well, that's all we need. Mm-hmm. Mae's here for another few days. We just have to keep the lovebirds apart until then. Your white blood cell count was great. There's no sign of infection. So the heart hasn't rejected me yet? Well, technically, you  would reject the heart. But you haven't. It looks good. It's been a full 48 hours, so we're gonna get you back to your room. And your mom is on her way there now. If I don't make it, I want you both to know I love you very much. [Chuckles] Is it me, or has Kara's new heart made her nicer? No, it's the morphine. [Chuckles] If we're done here, I'm gonna run up to see Charlie. Larry wants to run another round of tests. "Larry"? You're on a first-name basis with Larry? Is there something I should know? No. No. No. Brittany : Dr. McAndrew! Hey. Um... Hey. You wanted Jordi's new scans. Yes. Thank you. Mm-hmm. I heard you and Dr. Grace got back together. Uh... I'm so sorry. I... I should have mentioned something first. Why? I also heard that Nurse Brumsfield's pug has arthritis. So... [chuckles] This is a workplace. You hear all kinds of things. It's no big deal. Thank you. I didn't want things to be awkward with us. Totally agree. Awkward is the worst. [Both chuckle] This is something all of us superheroes have to contend with... the mere mortals of the world looking at us with desperate hope, knowing if we can't save them, no one can. Come on, Charlie. You can do it. Let's give it another try. I believe in you, buddy. It's a lot of pressure. They're all waiting to see me use my new superpower. And here it comes, faster than a speeding bullet. [Laughs] Yes! That's my boy! Yes! Your mom is gonna be so bummed she had to work this morning. I mean, she was practically doing backflips when he sipped water. Now look at him. Yes, his swallow reflex is coming along quite well. I think we can safely say that Charlie no longer requires a feeding tube. Uh, so, what does that mean, exactly? It means he can go home. [Sighs] Oh, this is nice. Mm. Want to sit on the couch? Sure. Hi. Good morning. Hi. Welcome to family weekend. I'm Dr. Jeffries. Caroline. Yes. Caroline? Jon Chota. Hi, Jon. Nice to meet you. Hey, Emma. Hi. Have a seat. Sure. Well, I'm very excited to be starting on this journey together. I find that these intensive therapy sessions can be invaluable. The truth is, when Emma came back this time,  it was a wake-up call for us, too. We really had to re-examine our approach. Well, I always thought that family therapy would be a great idea. I don't know why we haven't done it before. But t... that doesn't matter. W... what's important is that we're here now. Be here now, right? That's what people say. Mm-hmm. I think what Caroline means is we really want this to work. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, we're gonna start with something fun and basic called the trust fall. It's just a way to make sure this feels like a safe place. So, who wants to start? Oh. I will. Okay. Come on up. Emma? Emma, stand about here. You're just gonna stand behind her. Okay. Just like that. And you're gonna catch Emma as she falls back. Okay. Cross your arms. Close your eyes. I'm here. Trust that your mom will catch you. I can't do it. What? It's okay. It's all right. What do you mean it's inoperable? The cancer has moved to his lungs. It's these dark spots here. I can't get any clear margins. So, what do we do? Well, the good news is, we caught it early. He was here, and it should be receptive to the chemotherapy. It didn't do crap last time. What makes you think chemo will work now? Look, I know you had a bad reaction... It didn't work. The chemo didn't work. You had to cut more of my leg off than you thought. I know, but there are new types of chemotherapy, and we're gonna try every single one of them until one works. And in the meantime, I'm looking into a new trial drug. He could get into a trial? I put his name in. He meets all the criteria. And I'm gonna push like hell to make sure that happens. Leo, this is not a death sentence. You are a fighter, and you're gonna kick this thing's ass, just like you did last time. Leo. [Sighs] A trial usually means you're out of options. Are we? [Voice breaking] Is Leo out of options? I think the trial's his best hope. Um... Leo never used his wish. I remember his friend Sam had a wish to meet Maroon 5, and his mom said how much comfort it brought them seeing him so happy. So, um... [Clears throat] Should I call the genies? That's what I'd do. Narrator : The passing of bodily fluids from one person to another...  I can't believe y'all got us watching this corny flick, man. Seriously... we were born with a terminal disease. Haven't we suffered enough?! When the B. cepacia bug is transferred through the saliva from one C.F. patient to another, it's deadly. [Groans] [Both laugh] Shh! You're missing the best part! It can lead to cepacia syndrome...  [Cellphone chimes] A rapid deterioration of lung function. [Flatline] Even with proper treatment, death often occurs within weeks. Pretty scary stuff, huh? [Cellphones chime] Preaching abstinence to teenagers is like yelling at my deaf Grannie Jean. Which is why I brought in a more realistic option. [Whistles] Listen up! I want to introduce you to Wendall and Stu. What are those, cool names for condoms? [Laughs] No. This is a whole other kind of protection. Kids, meet your new bodyguards. Well, this looks delicious... chocolate milk, mashed-up fruit... thingy. It's like the ivy up in here. God, I could use a gimlet. That makes two of us. Or some more of that morphine they gave me. Okay. [Gasps] Oh, I'm sorry. What? Oh, my God! It's just water, honey. I don't feel it. What do you mean? I mean, I can't feel it. There's a gallon of freaking ice water on my chest, and I can't feel a thing! Okay, okay. We'll talk to the doctors. Maybe they can explain... No, there's nothing to explain! I'm just broken... permanently and for the rest of my stupid, pointless life. And I'm supposed to act like I'm one of the lucky ones? I'm not. You know it. I know it. Every...  Stop! You can't do this anymore. You can't... be this way. You have to be better. You just... have to. Hello, Sylvia. Hi. You heading home? Uh, no, no. My husband's holding down the fort. I couldn't bear to leave Leo right now. I am trying to find something to cheer him up, but it is slim pickings for a 16-year-old. You don't think the princess key chain would cut it? [Chuckles] I'm sure the old Leo would think that was very funny, but... Look, I... I know it's really hard to see your son like this. You don't understand. Leo has always been the one to buck everyone else up. Through the surgery and the chemo, he never got down. I know this is gonna sound terrible, but... I've learned to live with Leo being sick, but... I just can't live with him being so sad. I... I can't imagine what you're going through, but we're all feeling this. Leo's is a champion in the peds ward. And... now, when I walk on that floor, everyone's a little off-balance. I know everyone says this about their kids, but... Leo, he's... He's a special kid. [Voice breaking] Special. Yeah. Come here. [Sighs] [Sighs] Come on, y'all, man. I just need you to create a distraction so that I can rendezvous with my lady friend. Maybe you shouldn't be rendezvousing. There's plenty of other girls out there that don't have C.F. Is Mae really worth getting sick for? Why is everyone making a big deal? Yo, I've been sick my whole life. You know what I haven't been my whole life? In a relationship. I haven't been crazy and reckless and just let loose. This is my time. It's all about the Dash right now. All right. I only got a couple hours before surgery. We got to do this quick. All right. Come on, Leo. I know you in. Oh, my... yo! Come on! How many times have I helped you out? I never said I wouldn't help you. Come up with a plan, and I'll do whatever. I don't care. Yo. I don't think he's getting better. Yo, maybe Spartacus should do the trick, man. Oh, yeah. Yo, man, if Spartacus doesn't help,  I... I don't know what will. [Coughs] Jon : When we first realized Emma was sick, Caroline and I talked about whether it was something she could have inherited from her grandmother. But what I don't understand is,  even if there was a genetic component,  what happened to bring it on so suddenly? Emma, for 15 years, you were a normal, happy kid, and... one day, you stop eating. Why? Well, it never happens overnight, Jon. Anorexia can be... Kayla. Kayla happened. Who's... Kayla? Kayla Alprin was a girl I met my first day at Marlborough. We were friends. I mean, we didn't... we didn't hang out after school or anything, but we ate lunch together every day for two years. And... she transferred to another school. I just, uh, I just remember coming back from summer break, and I was standing there with my lunch tray... and I was looking at all the tables... [Sniffles] And, uh... I had no place to go. So I went to the library. Um... but there's no food allowed in the library, so I left my tray outside, and then... [Sniffles] after a while, I just, uh... I just stopped going to the cafeteria at all. And I was hungry at first, but then, uh... after a while, I got used to it, I guess. And I liked having the extra time to study. And the more I thought about it, the more I figured... "If I don't need lunch... ... maybe I don't need breakfast or dinner, either." And then, it just kind of, um... i... it kind of became a new project for me, [voice breaking] you know, seeing how long I could go without eating any food. Not eating was all I thought about. I didn't care about the fact that I didn't have any friends. I just... [Sniffles] All I cared about was making it through another day without eating. [Sniffles] Why didn't you tell us this before? You never asked. When do you think that he'll start talking again? It's difficult to say. Brain injuries are fickle. It could be a month. It could even be a year. There's no way to know. For instance, my new patient, a woman in Florida, woke up from a coma speaking Mandarin. What I think Dr. Naday is trying to say is that Charlie's come a long way, but he may never get better than this. Well... this is more than we could have ever hoped for. I mean, it's a dream come true, honestly. Um... His mom and I can never repay you two for everything that you've done. [Laughs] And if that doesn't give you the warm fuzzies, nothing will. What? Mandarin? Yes. [Sighs] Yes, I was going to tell you. I... I just got the call this morning. Florida? Mm. Mm. When are you going? Today. My flight leaves at 5:00. You know, honey, I think I do remember Kayla. She's the one with the long braids, right? I'm not gonna do this. Do what? I'm not gonna talk to you in a public bathroom like nothing's happened. I thought that's why we're here... to talk so we can go back to being a family again. Isn't... honey, isn't that what your therapist wanted? I don't think that's gonna happen. This may never get better. [Door opens] [Door closes] [The Ramones' "California Sun" plays] [Indistinct talking] Jordi : Here we go. Ready? [Laughs] Let's do this! Girl : Go!

You didn't even try. Who cares? It worked, didn't it? Dash made a break for it. What do you want from me? Hey, is he okay? Yeah, he's fine. Dash is on the roof. You should get to him. Yeah, um, I'm going. [Sighs] You shouldn't be smoking. How did you... You're not supposed to be out of bed! Well, I wouldn't have to be if you hadn't left me. I'm not playing this game, Kara. Get back to your room. Your father is coming. What? [Scoffs] No, I... I don't want dad. Well, I can't stay. Well, you have to. If we're gonna do this, then we're doing it together. Are you even listening to me? Stop. Shh. Don't shush me. Bee. There's a bee. What? [Gasps] Where? On you. There's a bee on you. [Gasps] Mom... Don't move. Just don't move, and it will... Cool. [Sighs] Mom? 
 
 Mae : Need a hand? I may not look like it, but I know my way around a toolbox. I'm Mae, by the way. What are you doing here? Dash is waiting for you. Yeah, but I wanted to see if you were okay. I'm fine. You're more than fine. You're Superman. I'm what? Dash has tag names for all of his friends online. Yours is "Superman," 'cause he said nothing can keep you down. You beat cancer, you brought the red banders together. You're like a real-deal hero. Yeah, well, I don't feel much like a hero right now. 'Cause you lost the wheelchair race? No, 'cause my cancer's back. That's fantastic! What are you inhaling? How, in any way, is that good? Uh, it means you don't have to be superman anymore... Which, I got to say, sounds freaking exhausting. I mean, not that cancer's any great shakes, but getting it a second time proves you're not invincible. So I should be happy that I have cancer? No, you should be happy you can finally take off the cape. I don't know how familiar you are with the Superman oeuvre, but it's like in "Superman II," when he loses his powers... And he gets the crap kicked out of him. Yes! Wasn't that awesome? I mean, sure, he got beat up, and it was painful, but he got to be with Lois Lane. He got to drink coffee. He got to have real conversation for once in his life. He didn't have to feel like the future of Earth depended on him. [Coughs] I mean, it's got to be such a relief, don't you think? [Coughs] And what are your thoughts on General Zod? [Both laugh] [Chuckles] [Elevator bell dings] Going up? Going down. Oh. You're Emma's mom, aren't you? I am. Yeah. You know what? I'm gonna ride with you. How's it going? Not great. Yeah. Same. I just lost two C.F. patients who are trying to kill each other. [Sighs] With love, but still... not good. Emma is amazing, by the way. Excuse me? Your daughter. You did a great job with her. Look, I don't know who you are, but... Oh, I'm Brittany. I'm Emma's nurse. Well, Brittany, if you're Emma's nurse, then you know better than anyone that Emma's not amazing. She's anorexic. That's just her disease. It has nothing to do with who she is. She's one of the kindest human being I've ever met, and... she cares about people. And she's smart, and she's funny. And... she's truly a good person. I was hoping I was gonna get the chance to meet you. Why? Because you made that person. [Elevator bell dings] Going up? Okay, little man. It's that time. This is gonna be your new best friend.

♪ oh oh oh oh ♪ Ooh! [Laughs] ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ She's not answering her cell. I don't know where she could have gone. She probably left. Your mother wouldn't just leave. Actually, she would. But, then, she changed her mind. I was thinking about, um... How you said anorexia can just creep up on you. I remember when Emma's doctor first told us that she was anorexic. Jon was so shocked, but... The thing is, I already knew. I'd known for a long time. Why didn't you say anything? I was embarrassed. Embarrassed that you hadn't come to me. I had a terrible relationship with my own mother. Growing up, I always felt like I'd somehow ruined her life, so when I got pregnant with Emma, I promised myself I would do everything differently. Emma and I were best friends. I never worried that she was hiding anything from me. I always felt like she told me everything. And then I bought you that dress. You know, the one with the lace fringe along the hem. I loved that dress. I know you did. You couldn't wait to show it to me. You looked so beautiful in it. I went to hug you. [Inhales deeply] That's when I noticed the safety pins. Emma had pinned the dress so that it would fit her. The dress I bought in her exact size... it took a whole fistful of safety pins [voice breaking] to tuck it in to fit. When I felt that, it was like my whole world... It shattered. I felt like such a fool. How could I not have noticed? I was so obsessed with not becoming my mom that I became someone so much worse. I became a mother that didn't know her own daughter was suffering. I didn't... know. This is not how I saw today going. Which part? All of it. Watching you faint was kind of fun. Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I thought we both had this phobia. The thing is, I saw the bee. I just didn't feel it. Even when it stung me, I didn't feel it. And now it's like this thing that I've been afraid of my entire life, suddenly, I'm not scared of anymore. Isn't that amazing? I guess. You know, this morning, when I couldn't feel the ice water on my chest, it was embarrassing. It was everything that sucks about what's happened to me... All the crappy stuff that I'm gonna have to get used to. But the bee was unexpected. It was... like discovering I had a superpower. That which didn't kill me made me stronger. I can change, mom. I know you can. So can you. [Scoffs] But you can't just leave when it gets hard. You can't smoke, and you can't call dad when you feel like bailing. You have to deal with me. I want to deal with you, Kara. I just... I don't want to fight with you. Then don't fight with me. Fight for me. I can do that. ♪ And we'll hate what we've lost ♪

[Laughs] Okay, let me try. Okay. Thank you. Yep. [Keyboard clacking] You're in a good mood. I think I helped today. You help every day. No, I mean... I went out on a limb. Emma's mom... I think she was about to walk out on their therapy session. Really? Yeah. And then, I remembered the night Jordi's mom left and how you tried to stop her and how terrible you felt when you couldn't. Thank you for that memory. [Laughs] Sorry. Well, and then, I just thought to myself, "I have to try." "And if I fail, then I'm in good company." But I didn't fail. She stayed. It wasn't too long ago that I recall a certain someone having doubts that this was her calling. I may have been mistaken. There you go. [Sighs] Thank you. They gave me the slip. The toxic twosome used the flash mob to cheese it. Okay. Let's go find them. Dash! [Coughs] [Coughing] What are you... Get back! What's wrong with you? [Sighs] Look, I seen you hanging out with Leo, all right? Now just go away. No. No, no, no. It's not what you think. I'd never even... I'm not jealous of Leo. You're not? Then, what's the problem? The problem is, you made Leo laugh. I've been trying to cheer him up for days,  and you made him laugh. [Scoffs] I was watching you in there, and I... I couldn't believe it. You really are, like, a beautiful, magical human being. You're strange and amazing, like... like a unicorn. So, why is that a problem? Because... as bad as I want to kiss you right now, I can't. I can't kill a unicorn. Um... You understand I'm not actually a unicorn? Because it's a mythical creature that's often mistaken with Pegasus. I know what you are, Mae. And I don't want you to die, all right? I want you to live a very long life. I got so excited about going down in a blaze of glory, I didn't take the time to consider that I'd be taking you down with me. So... what do we do now? I don't know. Yo, man, are you sure this is how you want to spend your last hour before going into surgery... getting your ass handed to you by a professional poker player? [Laughs] Yeah. I call. Yo, man, this game is stupid. [Laughs] Yo, can I play the next hand? Oh, absolutely. I just got to maybe change the game to something a little more Dash's speed. Oh, okay. How about Go Fish? All right, whatever. That's how you want to play it? Cool. I'll take both of you down. Here we go. Here we go. I've been playing go fish before you were even a thought, man. [Laughing] Okay. Hey, guys. Can I borrow Leo for a minute? We're kind of in the middle of a game. Don't worry... I'll have him back before Dash loses any more money. [Laughs] [Light laughter] Sarah : Hey. You're out of the ICU? Must be feeling better. Well, considering there was a saw going through my chest a couple days ago, I'm not complaining. Well, actually, I was complaining,  but I'm not anymore. How come you look like crap? My parents are here for family weekend. Ohh. Bummer. Yeah, it's... overwhelming. I think my mom and I bring out the worst in each other. Yeah, that's what moms are for. I mean, there's an entire reality-TV empire built on it. Honey Boo Boo child, the Kardashians, pageant moms... How come you two suddenly look like the Gilmore Girls? I decided to give her a chance. A real one. [Breathes deeply] I don't... I don't know if I can do that. Well, you gave me a chance. [Chuckles] Are you serious? He got into the trial? He starts tomorrow. Oh! Oh, that's amazing! Mwah! Can you believe it, Leo? You make good things happen, buddy. No. Don't say that. Honey. Mom, I... look, I got cancer twice. I could die. I'm not lucky. I'm not Superman, so let's stop acting like I am. 'Cause I can take the disease, but I can't take the pressure, okay? Okay. Okay. Good. So, uh... tell me about this trial. Really good work today, everyone. We made a lot of progress. We'll pick up where we left off tomorrow. Okay. All right. Um, I'm... not sure that I should come back. It's not that I don't want to. It's just, I'm not sure... I'm good for Emma. All I want is for you to get better, my love. Please tell me what to do. I can't bear to fail you again. Mom, you didn't fail me. The only reason I didn't tell you I was sick  was because you were my best friend. I was the one who was embarrassed. I didn't want you to see me the way that I saw myself. [Voice breaking] I didn't want our relationship to change, mom, but I couldn't stop. [Sniffles] I really wanted to, but I couldn't stop. [Sniffles] [Crying] Ohh. I'm sorry. No. [Footsteps approach] Could be a long surgery. I know. That's why I stocked the fridge. Charlie go home yet? Nick is signing the discharge papers as we speak. What about Naday? [Chuckles] "Larry." Mm. He took off a few hours ago. How are you? Mm... Miserable, thrilled... devastated... relieved. Mm. That sounds about right. [Chuckles] That's the real problem with this place. You know? Not the lousy hours or the crappy pay. Not even the fact that we get puked on at least once a week. [Chuckles lightly] It's that... everybody leaves... one way or another. I can get used to almost anything. I... can never get used to goodbye. Well, I'm not leaving. Me, neither. ♪ Is this the end? ♪ Thought I'd find you up here. Charlie's leaving. I heard. Dash wants to do this whole thing. Yeah, I know. How are you? I'm tired. Me too.

Where's Mae? Wherever I'm not. Although, I'd like it to be otherwise, but you can't always get what you want. Ah, but if you try sometimes... Oh, you just might find... No! No, no, no. We're not doing that. We're not doing this. We're not ruining Charlie's final moments with some hokey old-people music. Oh, the Stones are not old. They're classic. Yeah, some things never go out of style. Some things stay perfect forever. Yeah, like us. This, what we have here. I don't care where we end up, but this is forever. Fine. Go ahead. Yeah?
