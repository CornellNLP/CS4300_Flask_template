 It's weird how people get hung up on stuff that doesn't really matter, until something that matters really happens. 
 Like cheerleading, for example. 
 Ow. 
 You just gave me niplash. 
 Are you manstruating? 
 You have no strength. 
 Kara Souders' reign of terror began in preschool, when she went for Halloween as Osama bin Laden. 
 Every superhero and princess surrendered their candy to her.

 Shouldn't we call 911? 
 Not till we post this on Instagram. 
 Yes, unconscious. Do CPR? 
 Really? 
 Yes. 
 Here's the thing about a hospital. 
 Everyone has somewhere to go and something to do, and you'd better not get in their way. 
 [Horn blaring] 
 Hey! 
 What makes you think this is a good idea? Hmm? 
 Pedestrians have the right-of-way. 
 Not you, buddy! Not you. 
 Everyone has two stories: The one they want you to know and the one they don't. 
 Please hold it. I'm late. 
 Doesn't mean I should be, too. 
 Ugh, did you even brush your teeth this morning? 'Cause your breath smells like toenails. 
 Can I help you? 
 My doctor said to meet him at the E.R. 
 Who's your doctor? 
 Doctor McAndrew. 
 He said to page him. 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. 
 Oh, I won. [Laughs] 
 Hey.

 Leo Roth's been here longer than anybody, except for me. 
 He used to be a leader, but now he's pulling back. 
 Well, I guess if you were waiting to see if your treatment had worked, you might not make the best choices, either. 
 Lately, he's been hanging out with Dash Hosney. 
 And Dash Hosney always knows where the party is. 
 This place is crawling with medical marijuana. 
 It's called Electric Avenue. 
 It's awesomesauce. 
 Crap, we should go. 
 We... we have class. 
 Yeah, we also have life. 
 Seriously? 
 Buzzkill. 
 All right. Let's hear it. 
 We thought this was the new physical therapy room. I guess we got the wrong place. 
 It... it seemed pretty small. 
 Yeah, it did, didn't it? 
 Boys, I know you could sell shoes to a snake, but I'm no snake. 
 So if you're gonna lie, lie well, and know who you're lying to. 
 Oh, boy. 
 Neanderthals were considered adults when they turned nine, which had to bite. 
 But today, you're considered an adult when you're, like, in your 20s, which is probably bad for the future of mankind, but lucky for me, 'cause I'm in a coma. 
 Yeah, this is me talking to you from a coma. 
 Deal with it. 
 The thing about a coma, is you can hear everything. 
 You just can't respond. 
 It can be so friggin' annoying. 
 Everyone knows how hard it is to make friends. 
 Imagine how hard it is to make friends in a coma. 
 I'm at a serious disadvantage here. 
 Here's what I miss. 
 The smell of pizza, yanking my chain, and my friends. 
 But not necessarily in that order. 
 We can get to class. 
 We don't need an escort. 
 Well, you got lost in that supply closet, so I'm really doubting you're capable. 
 Well, I'm sorry. I know that looked stupid. 
 Yeah, only if you get caught. 
 What did you say, Dash? 
 Nothin'. 
 Mm Hmm. 
 Living in a hospital is sort of like going to boarding school. 
 You have a lot of rules, but a lot of freedom. 
 And if you get in trouble, I mean, how bad can it be? 
 You're already in a hospital. 
 Hold on, Leo. 
 Life is full of black holes, honey, we can fall into at any time. 
 That's a given, but I have made an investment in you. 
 And I like my investments to pay off, so I have to protect them. 
 Now get your ass in school. 
 I mean, let's think about it. 
 He displays intelligence and charisma. 
 Henry is a teenage prince... 
 Your girlfriend's here. 
 Shut up. 
 And he's got more than a few problems... 
 Oh, nice of you two to join us. 
 "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers." 
 Here's the weird thing about a hospital. 
 You become friends with kids that you would never know in a million years. 
 Losers, populars, stoners, nerds... 
 The walls just kind of fall down. 
 And then, there was Emma. 
 Emma was destined for greatness, but her eating disorder keeps getting in her way. 
 And what did you win first prize for today? 
 Oh, I actually received a major award, but you missed it because you were late. 
 Emma and Leo met when Leo first got here. 
 Both super smart, athletic, they brought out something powerful in each other, their real selves. 
 And it freaked them both out, because they both felt it, and they didn't want to. 
 Hey, what're you doing in that chair? 
 Why are you so skinny? 
 Leo got scared, and he blew it. 
 They both regret it. 
 So now they're obsessed with making each other miserable. 
 Hey, Leo. 
 Why don't you tell me about Katharine's relationship with Henry? 
 She's totally hot for him. 
 No, she's not. 
 They can't communicate. 
 He speaks horrible French. She doesn't speak English. 
 See, around her he doesn't have to be the best at everything. That's why she's into him. 
 No, that's why he's into her. 
 Okay, we get it. 
 Henry is a total pleasure-seeker, right? 
 But he has no close friends. 
 Why? 
 He's going to war, and getting too close to anyone's a bad idea. 
 Explain. 
 'Cause then it... it won't be hard to say goodbye. 
 When you're in a hospital trying to get better, the most important part of you that needs to survive... 
 Is you. 
 Everyone, let's read the Saint Crispin's day speech to ourselves, and then we'll discuss. 
 You're not my patient. 
 Paging Dr. McAndrew. 
 I can't find you in the system. 
 So who referred you? 
 Me. 
 I referred me. 
 It takes months to get an appointment with you, and by then my cancer will have spread. 
 So I told them I was already your patient, and by law they can't turn me away at the E.R. 
 That's not bad. 
 Here's my file. 
 This is in Spanish. 
 I'll translate it for you. 
 I have osteosarcoma, right leg. 
 Hang on a second. Where are your parents? 
 My mom, she died, last year. 
 We were living here. 
 My dad, I don't know. 
 I was sent to Mexico, to my cousins. 
 Is that where you were diagnosed? 
 And my doctor said I need the surgery first, and then the chemo. 
 I want you to do it. I've read you're the best. 
 You're the only one who leaves the part of the bone. 
 Jordi, I admire your courage. 
 Balls. 
 I prefer balls. 
 I don't work like this, all right? 
 So go home to your original doctors, and they'll take good care of you. 
 I knew the odds of getting you as my doctor sucked. 
 But I figured what the hell? 
 I mean, what was the chance I was gonna get cancer? 
 Here I am. 
 I take it the word "no" is not in your vocabulary. 
 If "no" was in my vocabulary, why would I be asking you to say "yes"? 
 When you work in pediatrics, there are always gonna be patients you really care about. 
 And patients you don't. 
 So what's his deal? Is he dead? 
 No. He is in a coma. 
 You don't mind if I smoke, do you, coma boy? 
 Didn't think so. 
 When people are sick you see how complicated they really are, because there's always that point where they drop their crap and let you in. 
 But not Kara. 
 You got to wonder what I did to deserve this. 
 That is so cool. 
 Who put these here? 
 Mm, I did. 
 I made them for you. 
 I thought we could be, like, muffin buddies. 
 Muffin buddies? 
 Come on. Be her muffin buddy. 
 Shut up. 
 [Laughs] 
 I have, like, a 24-hour shift today. 
 Don't use "like" like that. 
 Oh, it's my boyfriend's birthday today, so I was wondering if I could just go hang out with him, for just one hour, on my break? 
 Brittany, how long have you been working here? 
 Six weeks? 
 I drove out with my boyfriend and our dog. 
 You're acting like I care. 
 Oh... 
 Good morning, Dr. McAndrew. 
 Good morning, Jackson. 
 I'm gonna need an MRI on our newest patient, Jordi Palacios. 
 Where were you thinking of putting him? 
 I was gonna defer to you on that one. 
 Mm, Miss Rosemary's baby in 515b. 
 So we ignore her? 
 As long as possible. 
 [Scoffs] 
 All right, here's the file. Mm. 
 I know just where this Jordi should go. 
 Yeah, I thought so, too. 
 So do you want to talk to Leo or should I? 
 I will. 
 What? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Charlie? 
 Charlie? Charlie? 
 You want to tell me why you pushed a kid in a coma's call button? 
 Well, the service here is terrible, and I'm starving. 
 Bring me a kale salad with grilled chicken, dressing, side, and a mineral water. 
 Coming right up. 
 Uh, what time are your parents getting here? 
 They were in a meeting in San Diego this morning. 
 So, like, another hour? 
 Mm. New phone? 
 Yeah. Jealous much? 
 Don't you ever press his call button again. 
 You understand? 
 You know what happens to patients who cry wolf? 
 We sell their organs for cash on the black market and split the money. 
 You don't scare me. 
 You're just some loser nurse who rides the bus. 
 Got to go make some calls. 
 No, I don't want a roommate. 
 I feel you pulling away, all right? 
 And now is not the time. 
 Look, it's not just them. 
 It's their parents, their grandparents, their stupid friends. 
 I happen to know, with this patient, you're not gonna have to worry about that. 
 So what? He must be a total loser. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Uh, Jordi, this is your bed. 
 I'm gonna order you some lunch. 
 Jordi, this is your new roommate, Leo Roth. 
 Leo, this is Jordi Palacios. 
 Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me. 
 Not much of a talker? 
 Not to you. 
 I'm sorry you heard that. 
 I'm... I'm not a tool. 
 I just have a lot of unknowns in my life right now. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Why are you here? 
 I have cancer. 
 In my leg. 
 Dr. McAndrew's taking it off tomorrow. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 I know the silence. 
 It's a real conversation-killer. 
 Nobody ever really knows what to say. 
 You're gonna get through it.

 Where you going? 
 I'm gonna meet someone for lunch in the adult wing. 
 Don't we eat in the rooms? 
 Usually, but today I have other plans. 
 When you're a kid in the hospital, you have the place wired. 
 Back hallways, service elevators... 
 They can't watch you 24 hours a day. 
 So you have kind of a freedom you could never have at home or at school. 
 You're everywhere. Like mold. 
 I need to ask you something. 
 Oh, no. 
 No, I-I can't be this person for you. 
 That's what nurse Jackson or Dr. McAndrew's for. 
 They can't answer this question. 
 Only you can. 
 Fine. 
 What? 
 Does it hurt?

 It's the chemo that sucks. 
 But maybe you'll get lucky and won't need it.

 First, we need to simply monitor her, keep her comfortable.

 But I do have to warn you that hearts are very hard to come by, and the waiting list is long.

 It is not that simple. And unfortunately, Kara's going to have a very difficult time qualifying. 
 Why? 
 We drug tested her.

 Big whoop. 
 Yolo. 
 Oh, Dash, this is friggin' amazing. 
 Yeah. It wasn't me, man. 
 It was the magic man, Ruben. 
 Good evening, gentlemen. 
 Where'd you get that? 
 One of the kids. 
 For lord's sake, Ruben. 
 So how long do you think we should let them stay up there? 
 Let's give them an hour. 
 Why? 
 Well, I asked a couple of nurses to join me up there after their shift. 
 Wh... why waste it? 
 You're welcome to join us. 
 I have surgery in the morning. 
 Don't look at me. 
 I can't help it.

 Hey. I need a phone. That Nazi nurse took mine. 
 Sure. 
 This is really old, like, 2013. 
 Can you ever just give it a rest? 
 If I could, don't you think I would?

 Hey. 
 Hey, thanks for nothing, buying the beer. 
 It's totally flat. 
 Next time, I want the real stuff, or I'll blow your cover. 
 Find your music, Kara. 
 Okay, listen. 
 Charlie told me to tell you that none of this is your fault. 
 See you looking real cold over here. 
 I wish you could see what I'm doing to your leg right now, because it's absolutely perfect. 
 Life is full of black holes, like nurse Jackson says. 
 And the only person who can pull you out is you. 
 I've been wearing these for a long time. 
 It's time to let them go. 
 Worst party favors ever. 
 This is from my first trip to the E.R. 
 Dash was there that night. It was the first time we met. 
 He kept playing dead and freaking out all the nurses. 
 Emma... This is from my first surgery. 
 And I want you to... to wear it, to keep you safe. 
 Thanks, Leo. 
 Kara... My skin graft... 
 Ugh. T.M.I., I just threw up in my mouth. 
 'Cause I believe, like skin, there are layers to you that have yet to be revealed. 
 Jordi... 
 This is the most important band of all. 
 I wore it when I had my big surgery. 
 And I want you to know you're not alone. 
 "We few... 
 We happy few, we band of brothers. 
 For he today that sheds his blood with me... 
 Shall be my brother." 
 Hey. 
 You didn't go with everyone for fro-yo? 
 I can't eat this late. 
 Surgery tomorrow. 
 Oh, no. 
 My red band, it must have fallen off somewhere. 
 Don't tell Leo. 
 Find you another one. 
 Emma... Can we dance? 
 It might be a while before I get to again.

 Hey. 
 This is for you. 
 I didn't want to say the reason why up on the roof in front of everyone. 
 But when I was having my big surgery, you spoke to me. 
 You know, when I was under anesthesia. 
 And you said something that only tonight I've come to understand. 
 You said, 
 "luck isn't getting what you want. 
 It's surviving what you don't want." 
 And, man... I'm surviving. 
 I only hope I can be half the man you are, my friend. 
 [Sighs] 
 It's hard to sleep over the sound of your thoughts. 
 You never answered my question, when I asked how much it hurts. 
 Okay, it does hurt. 
 But not in the way you think it will. 
 They give you awesome painkillers for the physical pain. 
 What hurts most is... 
 [Sighs] Is not that... That it's gone. 
 What hurts is... is remembering it was ever there. 
 But then, with time, that memory stops hurting, too. 
 I won't be me anymore. 
 You will be you. 
 You will always be you. 
 You might even be more you. 
 How? 
 Because, and I'm gonna let you in on a secret now, because your body isn't you. 
 Your soul is you, and they can never cut into your soul. 
 Now, go to sleep and stop bothering me.
