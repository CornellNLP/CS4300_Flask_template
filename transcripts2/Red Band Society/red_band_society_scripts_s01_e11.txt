 Previously on "Red Band Society"... 
 California children's services will not allow me to perform the surgery until you're officially emancipated. 
 What if I can make that happen? 
 Alexa, meet me outside the hospital in an hour. 
 (Pager beeps) 
 What is that? 
 It's my unos pager. 
 New liver flying in, people! 
 I'm Ashley, Hunter's sister. 
 If I hurt your feelings or I misled you in any way, I apologize, but either get over it or get out. 
 Apparently, I need more time. 
 The powers that be are thinking one more week, possibly two. 
 Honey... 
 I will never understand you, mom! I hate you! Emma, open this door! I want you to forget about all of us. Especially her. I'm sorry, Kara. I don't think that's gonna be possible. Why not? 'Cause how could anybody ever forget you? My pop-pop once told me that guilt is a useless emotion. Mind you, he told me this from behind the glass at San Quentin. But still, I think he was onto something. Guilt cripples you, makes you second-guess all the decisions you believed were good at the time. Pop-pop thought that tax fraud was a fine option, just like these two were sure sleeping together would be no big deal. (Elevator bell dings) Of course, you can't keep guilt in forever. Eventually you have to confront the things you've done, even if that discussion leaves something to be desired. So, we don't have to ever... Wasn't planning on it. That's good, 'cause it... It didn't happen. Right. So... Leo, it's late. I'm tired, and as far as I'm concerned, we never have to talk about this again. (Elevator bell dings) It's about damn time. Look, I left something on your bed. Hey, what did you leave on her bed? I'll tell you what I left on her bed when you tell me where the hell y'all been all night, man. Sorry. I lost track of time. So you don't have a phone? It died. And we went to this coffee shop to try and charge it, and the guys were like, "no, you can't use my outlet. I'm writing a screenplay." So we just left. You banged! Yo, I knew it! You had that look on your face. Kara's hair's all messed up. And, frankly, I can smell it on you, man. I've developed a nose. I would not share that with people. All right, I need the details. Was your leg on or off? Uh, it started on and it came off. What? That's all you're getting. I don't want to talk about it. Dude, I do not want you to feel guilty about this. Guilt is an unhealthy emotion, man. It's antithetical in our world's existence. Do you think cheetahs regret killing gazelles? No, because they know that if they didn't, we'd have an overflow of hoofed creatures on our planet, and then where would we be? I do not feel guilty. Not even a little bit? No! Why should I? Emma broke up with me. She didn't return any of my calls, and it's very clear she wants to move on. Leo, I've been looking everywhere for you. Why? What's going on? It's Emma. Her dad brought her into the E.R. a few hours ago. The E.R.? What? She's asking for you. Come on. That's another thing about guilt. You never know when it'll spring you into action either for good or for bad. Nicely done. Money first. (Sighs) $300. It's all here. By the way, I have a friend who might want to get in on the action. All right, this is only a means to an end for me. I'm not actually a drug dealer, Alexa. Yeah, that's what my other drug dealer says. Dr. McAndrew. Hey. Um, Hunter is stabilized and in recovery. Oh. I thought you'd want to know. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. No, um, Brittany. I'm sorry for snapping at you before. That was... It's fine. No, no, no. It's... it's... it's not fine. There are, uh, dozens of ways I could have told you... To grow up? (Scoffs)  There is only one way. Um, sometimes, you don't want to hear it, but sometimes, you have to. And you were right, so thank you. All right, well, that's very mature of you.  (Chuckles) Well, there are some benefits to watching own. (Chuckles) Have a good night. Oh, and, um, FYI... You have a drool situation. Yeah. (Chuckles) (Scoffs) Oh, my god. Seriously, Hunter? Charlie. You awake? What is this? Some sappy goodbye letter? Should I even open this? I shouldn't, right? Blink once for yes, twice for no. Wait. Was that once or twice? Neither. I'm morse-coding god to make you go away. Fine. I'll open it. Probably some pretentious poem about conscious uncoupling or some weir... "Pre-stated dispensation"? What the hell is this? I don't understand how this happened. She made weight. She was cleared to go home. There's a tipping point with anorexia. Now, I'm not saying Emma's there yet, but we may be seeing the beginning of long-term effects to her health, which are irreversible. Leo. Emma, what happened? I fainted, and I hit my head, and now the doctor thinks I've done irreversible damage. Well, we don't know that yet. Like I said, we have to do more tests. Hello, Leo. Mr. Chota, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. No, I'm... I'm glad you're here. Emma's been asking for you. In fact, now that you are, I should go call my wife and let her know what's going on. Be back in a bit. I'll talk to you soon. Mr. Chota. I'm so embarrassed about everything, Leo. Please don't hate me. Of course I don't hate you. It's all gonna be okay. No, it's not. I should have never left the hospital or said anything that I said. Will you stay with me? Please? I'm not going anywhere. Nurse Jackson, before you go home and binge-watch "castle," I need you. Kara, my shift is over. So unless your eyeballs are falling out, may I direct you to the night staff? Please, I just need you to tell me what this is. Where'd you get this? Hunter left it for me before he was discharged. Oh, honey. Look. Hunter didn't leave. He got paged. His liver came in from Sacramento. He went straight into the O.R. I need to go see him. You can't. He's in the ICU. Now, the next 48 hours are crucial. We are monitoring him around the clock. Why? To see if his body rejects the organ. Which is why he signed this direct donation to you. I don't understand. Kara, if Hunter doesn't make it, he's leaving you his heart. (Exhales sharply) Guilt... otherwise known as nature's caffeine. I once couldn't sleep because I accidentally stepped on a lady bug. Imagine how Kara feels knowing that she cheated on the guy who literally gave her his heart. Of course I knew about it. Dr. King mentioned it so there was a plan to procure the heart in the event that Hunter doesn't pull through surgery. And he did his homework. He found out they were a blood match. But Kara didn't know. And now that she does, she's freaking out. Why didn't you tell me about this? I didn't think I needed to. What's... What's the problem? For starters, he's an organ donor, and I have much sicker patients who are depending on transplants. Kara's not even on the unos list. I know. That's not the point. When a patient signs a legal form, our hands are tied, end of story. Not if that patient wasn't in his right mind. We both know that severe liver failure can cause delusional thoughts. Okay, I'm not gonna stand here and say that Kara's a Saint. But she obviously got through to Hunter, so maybe he's made a difference in her. Maybe she's changed. She's not qualified for the heart. You don't get to make the decision. No. But I do get to appeal. And I will. Fine. Thank you. Thank you. Glad to see you two being so diplomatic. That's new. Well, when the Geneva convention resumes, try to keep in perspective that Hunter Cole is still critical but very much alive. For the time being, his heart belongs to him. Mm. I mean, I like it. The cut goes against your frame, but the pinstripes, they create a story. Personally, I'd rock a fedora with this ensemble. I'm not wearing a hat with this, Dash. What? A fedora's more than just a hat, man. It's a statement. Let me go get some examples. Oh, are you into something like a-a deep plum? No. I could lend you a different-color tie. Uh, thanks, but I think I'm good. Shouldn't you be downstairs with Emma? Her doctors kicked me out. They're running more tests. Uh, did you all graduate med school in the past 12 hours? That's sarcasm for, "what are you doing in the doctors' lounge?" Sorry. This is the only place with a full-length mirror. I'm going to court today. Today? Okay, well, you stay. You, Dr. McAndrew moved your scan up to 3:00 this afternoon. Might put a bit of a crimp in my schedule... If I had a schedule. That's sarcasm for, "no problem." Good. Now, go to your room. There's a surprise waiting for you. Really? Mmhmm. Hey, good luck today, man. How are you seeing the judge today? Megan told me your final emancipation hearing wasn't happening for a few weeks. She got my appointment moved up. Well, did she contact anyone in your family to let them know? Smoke signals should reach my mom in about a year, depending on where she is. My abuela... no word. No surprise. I'm sorry, Jordi. It's okay. I'm used to it. Surprise! Surprise!  (Laughs) Mom! Dad! What are you guys doing here? Oh, you know, we're just in the 'hood. Your mom wanted to check out the new erewhon. Well, I did. And we will. But first... We're here to bring you home. But how? My P.T. Guy said I couldn't leave for another week. He told us the same thing, so we made a few calls and found this great rehab facility right near us. They have everything you need. And since you're already in remission, there didn't seem to be any good reason to keep you here for another minute. What? This is happening now? Mmhmm. Yeah. Well, we have to sign the discharge papers, and we know you have another scan this afternoon. Which will give me plenty of time to hit the erewhon, because I am making you the ziti to end all zitis. You'll be back in your own room tonight. How's that sound, kid? Uh, it sounds amazing. That sounds amazing. Oh, baby.  (Smooches) (Chuckles) What? No. No, no. No. I said... I said I want butterscotch! Butterscotch! (Slurring)  How much clearer can I make it, Eugene? This is discrimination. (Gasps)  This is 'cause my mom's a lesbian, isn't it? Kara, what the hell are you doing? Dashiel. You are looking Dashing. Has anyone ever told you that? (Chuckling)  God, I'm so funny. Are... are you drunk? Heck, yeah, I'm drunk. And why shouldn't I be? The most ridiculously good-looking guy on the planet chose to love me, and how do I repay him? I bone Leo! Shh! I know that, and now everyone else does, too. Oh, my god. I apologize, Eugene. (Groans) Uh, Mrs. Adam, Miss Fong, I'm sorry. Carry on, everyone. Listen, you need to work on your inside voice. I don't care who knows it! Nothing matters anymore! All right, stop beating yourself up over the whole Leo thing, all right? You had no way of knowing Hunter was gonna get his liver. And technically, you dumped him before you left. Which technically makes me the worst person on the planet. (Sighs) I don't deserve his heart. Look, I'm sure people have loved you for less. No. His heart heart that he donated... to me. He made a direct donation? Yep. (Scoffs)  And you're sitting here drunk and eating pudding? And nachos. The pudding was to wash them down. Kara, what is wrong with you? What if you end up having to go into surgery? I don't want to have the surgery. I don't want Hunter's heart. I just want... Hunter. I have to burp. Hey, have, uh, you seen Kara? Uh, no, but I'm about to start my rounds, so... Whoa, ohh. You two would make beautiful babies. In case it's not obvious, we have a problem. I do not understand you, Kara. Did you come pre-wired to torture the world? I'm sorry I'm a mess, okay? But not all of us can blow off steam by playing darts and bro-hugging it out to "piano man." I mean, besides the fact that you're a heart patient and you shouldn't ever be drinking, you might have an actual heart on its way to you right now. I don't care. I don't want it. Good. Because you're not gonna get it like this. Hey, hey. She's worried about Hunter. (Sighs)  All right. Look. You're gonna feel much better once you get rehydrated. And what if I fuse the surgery? You can't operate on me, can you? Don't worry about that right now, all right? You just get some rest, and everything's gonna be fine. (Sighs)  I once drank a half bottle of peach schnapps when Janet Marino told everyone I had dandruff. It wasn't true, but I still got drunk and washed my hair. Booze is always a good idea until it's not. She's gonna... She's gonna pull through. She's...  (sighs) Should I let Dr. Grace know about this? No. No. Uh... Unless you feel like you should. I don't want to put you in an uncomfortable situation. No. I don't see any reason to involve anyone else. (Sighs) Dude, Kenji told me the good news. All right, how about a little impromptu going-away? Got the white widow if you got the time. It's probably not a good idea to smoke with my parents wandering around. (Sighs)  All right, fine. But we got to do something ceremonial, man. A red bander is leaving the fold today. Maybe. What are you talking about? With everything going on, it doesn't feel right to take off. Dude, stop worrying about Kara, man. They're pumping that girl up with so much b12, she'll be able to climb machu picchu. I was talking about Emma. You mean the girl who dumped you? She broke up with me. I mean, it doesn't matter anymore. She's freaking out. She begged me not to go anywhere. Doesn't that tell you something? Right. It tells me she's scared, and she needs a friend. (Sighs) Look, man. You're my friend, and I love you like a brother, which is why I got to keep it real with you right now. You make her worse. As long as she has you to focus on, she'll never be able to focus on herself. Now, if you really want to help Emma... You got to set her free. My name is Jordi Palacios, and although I come from humble beginnings, when I'm emancipated... (Cellphone rings) (Beep) Hello? Yeah, yeah, this is Jordi. Who is this? Wait. You got my number from who? Look, I don't care what Alexa said. Don't ever call me again. (Beep) (Sighs) Jordi. Nurse Jackson.  (Sighs) What are you doing here? Researching my next legal thriller. Somebody's got to take Grisham down. What do you think? I'm here for you. Looks like I got here just in time, too. You can't be sweating like this in front of the judge, baby. Look like you just robbed a liquor store. (Chuckles)  Yeah, I probably shouldn't have taken the stairs. Probably not. Look, let's get you some water before you have to go in. Hey. How you doing? Stable. The doctors say my slow heart rhythm should correct itself, but they won't know for a few days, so... Looks like I'm back. Shortest escape ever. Well, that's not true. In the fall of 1941, John bayless tried to escape Alcatraz, and he stepped one foot in the water and gave up. So, my parents drove down today. Really? Where are they? Signing discharge paperwork. I'm going home early. Oh. Well, that's great. You worked really hard, Leo. You deserve it. Thanks. And hopefully I'll be out soon, too, and I can come visit you in Bakersfield. Sure. Yeah, we'll... we'll hang out as, uh... as friends. About that. I made a mistake. No, you don't have to... No, Leo. I'm really sorry about breaking up with you. I wasn't thinking clearly. It's not what I want. 
 
 Emma, you passed out. You're back in the hospital. The doctors are saying there are serious things wrong with you. This is beyond us now. Well, it doesn't have to be. I can work on myself and still have you. No. No, we can't. Why not? Because, uh... "Because, uh" why? I-I don't understand. (Sighs)  'Cause I slept with Kara. Get out. Emma, I'm sorry. Get out of my room, Leo! Get out! Hi. It's me. I guess we haven't spoken since that turbulence. Thank you, by the way, for landing that plane... Even though St. Barts was way overrated. Anyway, um... Hunter would kill me for doing this, but somebody needs to speak for him because he's young and beautiful and smart, and he has so many gifts... Don't stop. You're doing a hell of a lot better than I've been doing. I just said "hell" in a chapel, thus proving my point. So, I heard that Hunter's donating his heart to you. Don't worry. I'm not gonna take it. Why wouldn't you take it? Because I can't. I don't deserve it, and I don't want Hunter to die. No, neither do I. And just to be clear, if there's a choice between him dying and you dying, I'd choose you. Right. Obviously. You're his sister, so... No, even if I weren't his sister. I bet if we took a poll around here of, "who would you rather die, Kara or Hunter?" If we pulled some sort of "American Idol" thing where you could text in your results, you... you'd go down pretty easy. And then Ryan seacrest gives you that sad hug, and off you go. Okay, first of all, I don't think Ryan's a hugger. I think you're confusing him for Heidi Klum, who occasionally hugs. But second of all, I... Nothing. Never mind. What? You disagree? I don't, but your brother might. True. But you don't give a crap about my brother. Of course I do. Then why would you deny him his last wish? This is bigger than you and me. So if he loves you, just love him back. Good. Then let's pray, bitch. So, Mr. Palacios, you appear to have your ducks in a row. I see transcripts, bank statements, this very nice letter from professor Ruben Garcia on your behalf. But what I'd like to hear from you is how you see your life as an adult. (Clears throat) My name is Jordi Palacios, and although I come from very humble beginning... Wait, no. I don't want to hear any prepared remarks. Put them away. You're not thanking your agent here. You're speaking from your soul. Imagine five years from now... Your cancer is gone, and you're out there doing your thing. Tell me about that, Jordi Palacios. What kind of adult do you see him being? For the pills. Um... Um... I guess... (Heart beating) I mean... I'm sorry. I don't feel very well all of a sudden. Jordi. Uh, excuse me, judge. If I may? Who are you? My name is Dena Jackson. I work at ocean Park hospital, where Jordi is currently undergoing chemotherapy. (Sighs) (Clears throat) I-I've only known Jordi a few weeks now. His story should be the saddest story ever, but you spend five minutes with him, and somehow it isn't because while everyone else is crying about all the things that they don't have, this kid, a sick kid, is... is plotting his next move. Now, he came to this court today asking to officially be named an adult, but trust me when I say he has more years in that soul of his than all of us combined. He's already a grown-up, your honor. So please... I just ask that you grant him the one thing the world won't... A break. Miss... Jackson. Jackson. I'm moved. Really. And I don't even cry when my grandkids color me stuff. But I can't, in good conscience, send a 15-year-old with cancer out into the world to fend for himself, not when he can't even fend for himself in here. I'm sorry, but his emancipation is denied. (Gavel bangs) I've been thinking. Rather than putting everybody through the misery of an appeal, maybe it's better if we just honor what Hunter wanted. Right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. So, how's she doing today? Kara? She's good. Stable? Normal, yeah. Sober? What? (Scoffs)  I knew it. You think I'm an idiot, that I can't look at her chart and see that you ordered enough fluids to hydrate a football team? You were... You were checking up on me. No, I was doing my job. This is so like you... Entrapment, manipulation. And you'll do whatever it takes to win, right? Even if it means lying or going behind my back? If you weren't so stubborn, I wouldn't have to do this. Oh! See? This is what was so good about Sam. Even if he wasn't the most exciting person on the planet, I always knew what he was thinking. You said "was." What? You said, "was so good about Sam." Past tense. You break up? Are we really talking about this right now? (Monitor beeping steadily) Hunter. You know, I shouldn't be in here, but then again, neither should you. Neither of us should be, but here we are. And the thing is, is if it weren't for this freakin' hospital, I would never have met you, so... I don't know. Maybe there's a reason. Maybe I love you. (Sniffles) Maybe I love you, Hunter. And... In case I do, you can't die. Please. (Voice breaking)  Please, don't die. (Sniffs) (Exhales deeply) (Alarm beeping) Hunter? Help! Someone help! His alarm's going off! I don't... Heart rate's dropping. Page Dr. King! Hunter? Hunter? Can you hear me? Hunter? Well... The good news is, you can reapply for emancipation in three months. The bad news is, I will not be the next Sonia Sotomayor. I messed up. Don't be hard on yourself. You just got nervous. No, I mean, I did something really stupid. What? I sold drugs. That's how I got the money for the application. What kind of drugs? Pain meds. Some I stole off other patients, some were mine. Oh, my god, Jordi. Why didn't you ask for help? I don't know how to ask for help. I'm not wired that way. But this? This was easy. I didn't even have to think about it, really. It just came naturally. And then when the judge asked me what kind of person I thought I'd be in five years, I knew. I am who I am already. I'm her. Who? My mother. Tell me something. If your mother had done what you did, would she have come clean? I mean, you got away with it, didn't you? You were home free. But instead of cashing in your chips, you walked away from the table. And you told the truth. Listen, Jordi, we all inherit things from our parents. But it's up to us to keep the good stuff and throw the rest away. That's what you did today. That's why I'm proud of you. (Chuckles) According to my abuela, I did get my dad's hair. Believe it or not, I inherited my mother's sunny disposition. (Both laugh) Mr. Chota. This your classroom? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's not a real classroom, but they try. Emma's always been good about her schoolwork. I don't think she's missed an assignment since she's been here. That's Emma. So, you... you know her? I thought I did. I thought I might have even been helping her. But can I be honest with you? Please. We live in this weird world here. And it's not just that everyone's sick. It's that we're all alone. And there are doctors and nurses, but mostly, we're by ourselves. And in some ways, it feels like we're all grown up. But we're not. Not really. We still need our parents. She needs you. I don't know how to fix her. You don't have to fix her. You just have to be here. (Sighs) Emma? I thought you went home. Couldn't stay away. Um, can I come in? Yeah. So, Hunter just had another surgery, and he got a liver, but he was in ICU... I know you slept with Leo. Oh. Yeah. You don't seem shocked. I'm not. Right. I guess I wouldn't be, either. Not... not because of Leo and I, obviously. I mean, there's nothing going on between us. It happened for all of the wrong reasons. Stupid reasons. But that's not the point. No. It's not. The point is, you would never do something like this. Not in a million years. Right. And I would. And that's why you're not shocked. You know, at the end of the day, you're a good person. You would never hurt a soul. In fact, the only person you've ever hurt is yourself. Whereas I... I hurt everyone all the time. I'm sorry. I may have screwed up my heart. The doctor said... I don't know, but the point is, I might actually be sick now. Emma... You've always been sick. I know, but I've never felt like I've lost control like this. This whole time, I kept thinking that I was the one in charge, but I wasn't. So the fact that you slept with Leo... D on't get me wrong. I hate it. I hate everything about it. But right now, I just... I don't want to be alone. Neither do I. Be really nice if we could be friends, even just for now. Yeah. I was thinking the same thing. You know, it would help if we had anything in common, but... Oh! I just found out I hate my mom. (Chuckles) Okay. I can work with that. (Laughs) (Monitor beeping) Heart rate's 162. Another unit of FFP. I can't see the bleeder. More suction. There it is. Got it. Looks like a half-centimeter rupture right by the left... Left hepatic vein. Forceps. Um, clamp, please. Sutures. Suction over there. Suction over there. We're losing the aline trace. Hang another bag of blood right now. Rupture's much bigger than I thought. Clamp. (Monitor beeping rapidly) We're losing him. I lost it. I can't see the bleeder. There's too much blood. (Flatline)  Come on, come on, come on. He's gone. Lap pad. Lap pad. I need a lap pad. Clamp. I need someone to clear the field. I need someone to clear this field! Adam. Come on! I need help here! Adam. What is it, Brittany? I need you to come down to MRI right now. I have to go. Go. Time of death... 5:22 P.M. The blood loss was ultimately too much. (Woman sobs) We did everything we could. As you know, Hunter was an organ donor, and the prep team from lifeshare is on their way. They'll have to move quickly, so if you'd like to see him, I can bring you. I'd like to see him, please. Of course. Please. No. No, no. I'm not going. No, no, no! Ashley. I want Hunter! Ashley, I got you. I got you. (Sobbing)  It's okay. Go to your son. I'll stay with Ashley. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I got you. It's okay. Hey. Thought you left. No, I was just, um... I was just walking the halls, trying to think of what I could say to you, how I can make this better. What'd you come up with? Nothing. I'm sorry, Emma. It's not your fault. (Sniffs) (Sighs) When you were born, I thought for sure you were gonna be a boy. I was ready for a boy. Planning for a boy. And then it was you. And I was so scared. I didn't know the first thing about little girls. But you made it so easy for me. You were always so good. I wish you had come to me when all this started. I'm sorry. No, this is on me. (Sighs) I'm gonna do better from now on. I promise. We're gonna beat this together. You understand? Hey. How'd it go? It didn't. Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, you have a visitor. Tell her to go home. Oh, well, I don't think I can tell her that. But if you want... Can I speak to you for a moment? Yeah. What's going on? Abuela? What are you doing here? (Chuckles) Someone called me and they told me my grandson was becoming a man today. I thought a gift was in order. The judge said no. Good. You're not ready. (Chuckles) Give me a hug, mijito. I rode a bus for you.  (Chuckles) (Knock on door) Hey. Sorry to bother you. I just heard about Hunter. Now, is there anything you need me to do? Should I... Should I sit down with Kara? Should I... Who? It's Leo. Oh, no. Oh, my god. I don't know how to tell him. He was supposed to go home today. I know. He was supposed to go home. Better take in this view. Won't be seeing any of this back in wine country. (Clicks tongue)  Bakersfield is not wine country, Dash. Yeah, man, whatever. As far as I'm concerned, anything north of la cañada is nothing but vineyards and B&Bs. (Scoffs) God, I'm gonna miss you, man. What am I gonna do without your wisdom? Oh, so you're finally admitting that I add some value to the conversation? Every now and then, you get things right, you know. Like this morning. I did feel guilty about Emma. I knew it! As soon as I seen your brooding, semi-bald head, man. (Chuckles) And you were right about letting her go. I knew that, too. Y'all were on a treacherous road to co-dependency. Had I not intervened, you would have woke up 10 years from now spiteful, bitter, and unable to pick a new pair of slacks without the other's permission. How do you know so much about this? I'm observant. And also, I never miss an episode of Wendy Williams. It still feels wrong. What feels wrong? Being single? No. Being unliked. I know it sounds shallow, but people generally like me.
