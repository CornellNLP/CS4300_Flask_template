 Previously on Red Band Society... 
 You need to focus on the matter at hand, which is getting you a brand-new heart. 
 I don't want to be friends! 
 Great! Neither do I. 
 Since when you want to get back with Emma? 
 Since now. 
 Your new roommate may have other plans. 
 I already squared things with him, and he's not moving in on her. 
 There is no foreseeable evidence that Charlie will come out of his coma in the new future. It is our recommendation that Charlie be removed from the acute-hospital setting to one of the approved facilities. 
 You don't think he's gonna wake up? 
 I don't know. 
 So that's it. We give up. 
 You don't think that this kills me, too? 
 Actually, I don't. 
 I made a promise to that little boy, a promise I intend to keep. 
 We don't make promises here. 
 Whatever Nurse Jackson's up to, it takes cojones. 
 Cojones means "balls." I learned that from my dad. When my first doctor told him I'd probably never wake up, he told him he had no cojones. Oh, hey. Do you want me to run that to the lab? I'm good. That was after he called the guy an egomaniac with a God complex. Turns out there are a lot of big egos in this place. I guess that's what happens when you're literally holding another person's life in your hands. Hey, Smitty. Hey. Gonna need a rush on Charlie Hutchison. Doesn't say so on the form. And we're backed up to the Gazoos. He's being transferred to convalescent care, and they're gonna need the lab work before he can be released. I'll see what I can do. All I know is... that wasn't my blood in that vial. And I'm being shipped out of here in exactly 41 hours and 57 minutes. But who's counting? It's a muscular work, isn't it? It's almost Promethean in its depiction of our eternal human struggle. And the calling of any urban artist is to depict that struggle. Yeah, I'm struggling to understand exactly what you're saying. The surging tension threatens to flood the senses. But over here, the artist brokers a tenuous truce between two forcers... What's up? I-I can't see anything. Move a little closer to the front. The view's perfect. No, I literally I can't see anything. Everything just went dark and blurry. Hey, Leo, you get what I'm saying, right? Yeah, sure. Uh, I can see that. Wait. What? I-I need you to take me downstairs. Let me get Nurse Jackson. No! Don't. Please, not in front of everyone. Just... O-okay. Okay. Come on. Child raising, and all of these are evident in this work. Now, if you had to buy this, how much would you pay for it? This is a question more suitable for social media. You are holding my hand. Thought you were holding mine. You look really pretty tonight. Jordi, let's not do... No, no, let's. I have feelings for you, and I feel like you have feelings for me, too. I was just thinking maybe our feelings could feel things together. That's a lot of feelings from one dance. Am I crazy? Is it just me? You're not crazy. No, it's just... It's just really confusing right now. And, honestly, I have no idea how I... What the hell? Medevac's coming. We need to go. I love the smell of napalm in the morning! He's a big fan of "Apocalypse Now." The horror! The horror! Are we there yet?! Almost. Try to stay calm, okay? Oh, sure, yeah. I'm just going full-blown Magoo right now. No big deal. It's probably some kind of side effect from the medication. I'm sure you're gonna be fine. You think so? Oh, my God. You don't think so. You're lying. You're lying to a disabled person. You know I have one leg. Is everything a competition with you? You know what? This isn't working. This isn't working. Wait. Don't leave me. I'm not. I just... I can't walk when you're hanging on to me like that. So, wait here. I'm gonna get help. Where?! Here's a wall. Lean against it, okay? I'll be right back. Wait. Okay, do I... do I look okay? You look great. I'll be back in a second. Um, did you, uh... did you call admin about Charlie's discharge paperwork? It's being processed. And I got you a granola bar from the commissary. Coconut almond? I mean, this is my favorite. I have a flair for detail. I can see that. Next time I see a... raspberry chia seed, I'll make sure I pick it up for you. All right, so, it looks like we're just waiting on Charlie's blood-work results. If everything checks out, then he's, uh... he's good to go. I know it sounds silly, but I'm gonna miss the little guy. It doesn't sound silly at all, but we have done everything we can for Charlie here, so he'll be better served at a care facility. If that's what you have to tell yourself to sleep at night. Let me know when the lab work's come in, all right? Will-do-ski. Will do. Because I am a professional. Good night, Brittany. Good night, Doctor. I found five blind-window-treatment stores in your area... Blinds are us, custom blinds... No! For the last time,  I  am blind. Sorry. I cannot understand you.  Stop talking. You okay? Yeah. Why wouldn't I be okay? You're talking to hand sanitizer. I may be having some temporary problems with my vision right now, not that it's any of your concern. Do you need help? No, I don't need help. I'm waiting for my friend. Who the hell are you? Not your friend, clearly. But I'm happy to walk you to your room. Ew! No. Do you even work here or are you some sicko with a fetish for hot, blind girls? Okay. Wait! Okay. It's just past the nurse's station on the right, room 515. If you even graze my boob, I will go full-blown ninjago on you. Duly noted. See you around. Wait. Where's my bed? Where's my bed? Oh, my God! Kara? Where did she go? I swear I left her right here. She was right here. Somebody help me, please! O-okay. Sit right here. There you go. Easy. All right. Okay. Now, how far apart are your contractions? Oh, my God. Oh, my God! I can see. I can see! I'm not blind! I'm not... I'm not blind! Oh, my God. Thank God. Wait. You bitches thought I was pregnant? B7. N31. I20. Ms. Kendall. I20. Sorry I was awol for so long. I went back to the roof, but you'd already left. B14. I volunteer here on Tuesday nights. My therapist says helping others helps us help ourselves. O63. Is it always this exciting? Well, last week, we played strip pinochle. It wasn't supposed to be, but Ms. Craushore took off all her clothes. G49. So, did you need something or did you just come here to stare at me all night, like Mr. Wilson? I want to find out when you're gonna tell Jordi about us. B5. Emma. 071. Are you ignoring me? Bingo! Great. Congratulations. That's it for tonight, guys. Uh, help yourselves to a danish. Emma. Since when are we an us? Since we kissed. You kissed me. And you kissed me back. Maybe, but then you left the roof with Kara. Yeah, 'cause she went blind. I know... crazy. Kenji says it's something that happens with heart patients. Good news is... she's okay now. Until the next time, and there's some new excuse, you know, blindness, homecoming. It's always something with her. That's not my fault. I'm not saying it's your fault, but it is your choice. You don't have to be the one who always saves her. You obviously want to be. Don't spin this around. You're the one that was holding hands with Jordi. Right, so I'd say you're the one with the decision to make. And the sooner, the better. ♪ Oh, heart of steel ♪

♪ Good morning, yeah ♪ Dr. McAndrew, good morning. Wow! That is uncanny. I mean, I don't know how you do that. Thank you so much. Yeah, sure. However, um... Mm. Wait a second. This isn't right. Well, that's because that's not yours. That's Kenji's matcha green tea. He calls it his "go-go juice." No, Charlie's blood work. There's a marked left shift in his white-blood-cell count, which usually indicates an infection. Has he had a fever? Uh, not that I know of. Should we be concerned? For Samuel Finch, maybe. It's his blood. No. You know, I don't think so. Let's order a chest X-ray, a urinalysis, a CRP. Uh, let's double-check those lab results and order a new blood culture. All right. I'm on it. Uh, what about his transfer to the meadows? Well, he's not going anywhere with an infection. The meadows is gonna have to wait. So that's why Nurse Jackson did it. Ugh! This tastes a little bit like grass. I'm into it. _ Come in. Hey! Dena! Oh, my goodness! Oh, how are you?! Oh, you look fantastic! Me? Look at you all fit and tan. Eh. Amazing what parasites and a lack of a good sunscreen can do. Is that your clinic? Yes, that's Doctors Without Borders in Senegal. That looks rugged. I went to doctors to get out of my comfort zone, and... and, Dena, honestly, it was life-changing. It opened me up in so many ways. I actually learned to embrace chaos. Mm-hmm. Embrace chaos. Maybe I needed to stay for a couple more months. Well, I'm so glad you came back to us. I mean, come on, chief of surgery? We're all so proud of you, hon. That means a lot to me. Really. But I'm sure not everyone is so thrilled. How's Dr. McAndrew? You mean Adam. Nope. I am not here to talk about your love life. I'm here to talk about a patient... Charlie Hutchison. My favorite topic. So, your scans show that you had what's called an ischemic attack. Yeah. You're a doctor. I get it. You know big words. Now can we do the English version, please? Well, in the simplest terms, your weakened heart couldn't get enough oxygen to your brain, resulting in a temporary loss of sight. Well, how temporary? I mean, is it gonna happen again? Could I go deaf or mute? That would be nice, at least until the doctor was done explaining. Um, excuse me. You're not the one turning into Helen Keller here. Look, I know this sounds scary, but... No, I'm not scared. I just... need to be prepared. I mean, if I'm gonna keep going blind, I need to get my eyebrows lasered asap. And it might be worth investing in a Brazilian. Blowout. Ew! Get your head out of the gutter, Ken doll. Kara, I was going to go over all this with your mom when she got here, but your situation has worsened enough to warrant surgical intervention. Wait. You mean... I'm getting a heart? Well, that would be optimal, but we can't get you an organ until you're on the UNOs list. So we're putting in a pacemaker as a stopgap measure. You can go ahead and prep her for surgery. Wait. This is happening today? 3:00. I'll see you then. Well, can I at least get a new set of boobs while I'm in there? You can just call me professor Dash. I'm kind of an expert at everything... dub interludes, ironic websites, literary classics, just in case you need a study buddy. Good morning, class. Today, we have a new student. Let's give a warm aloha,   konnichiwa,  and  bienvenidos  to Jordi P. The themes of "Pride and Prejudice" are universal, so I want you to pick a partner and present an argument as to how they are relevant to today. Off you go. Damn, the stars are just aligning for us today, huh, Alexis? Kelly? Just let me know when I'm getting warmer. Dash. Sorry. I'm already partnered up with, uh... Lisa. You're with me. Let's go. Diane? Come on. I was making progress with, uh, Michelle. Looks like we're stuck together. Glad this isn't gonna be weird and uncomfortable for anyone. Well, Dr. Naday uses brain stimulation with MRI imaging to Gauge consciousness, and he's had positive results in 89% of his patients. This could be the breakthrough Charlie needs. So you're proposing we bring Naday here to examine him. I know it's a lot to ask. He's in Israel, and he'd need privileges. Dena, I would love to have Naday here. You would? But he cherry-picks his cases. And... honestly, I just don't see anything in Charlie's files that would lure him here. I'm sorry. If it's any consolation, the meadows is a fantastic facility. I know that, but Charlie's friends are here. His friends? Hasn't he been in a coma since his surgery? Some of the patients have reported seeing him when they've been unconscious. They know things about him that they couldn't have known otherwise. I know. I know. You think I'm crazy. No. I was actually remembering this spirit in Senegal who used to rearrange my fruit bowl at night. I'd wake up to bruised bananas every morning. At first, I was freaked out. And then I got mad. And by the end, I was just making smoothies. So... you believe me. I don't not believe you. It is worth me reaching out to him. Assuming you've run this by Dr. McAndrew. He and I aren't exactly on the same page when it comes to Charlie's care. Seriously? When are the two of you gonna get some marriage counseling? Says the woman who's been avoiding him ever since she got back. Okay. I have to rip the band-aid off. I will go talk to Adam. Okay? Okay. All right. All right. I don't care if the surgery is scheduled. Just unschedule it. Your dad already tried to get them to postpone so he could fly back from New York, but they said it has to happen today. Well, you understand that the doctors called it a "stopgap measure," which basically means they're stalling. It's a temporary measure. Exactly. I don't want temporary. I want a freaking heart. We all want that, sweetie. Yeah, then don't sign the consent form. Kara. Mother, it is a B-level procedure. Okay, remember when we went to Cabo and we got the garden-view room? You yelled at the concierge, and then we got the appropriate upgrade. Why? Because we are Souderses. Souderses don't settle for second best! Why are you yelling at me? Because you're not yelling at anyone. Okay. This is not a productive use of our time. You're getting the pacemaker... End of story. Wait. Where are you going? I have a shareholders meeting. I'll be back in less than two hours. You won't even know I'm gone. Are you kidding me right now? I'm about to have surgery. Oh, come on. Souderses go under the knife all the time. I've had my face lifted so often, I can barely close my eyes. That was a joke. Whatever. Just go. Okay. Fine. I can switch some things around at work. No, I don't want you here. Kara. Just leave. Leave. I'll just be downstairs. What the hell are you looking at, Captain Oblivious? Someone who could use a hug right now... Or at least a friend. Here's what I have. "Pride has led to the spread of many bad things, including the crisis in the Ukraine, hurricane Katrina, and white-girl twerkin'." Write that down. I did. What do you have? Nothing. Nothing? You've been tapping away like Alicia Keys over there. I'm sorry. I'm distracted, okay? Just pick Leo, man, and be done with it. I mean, yeah, but it's not that simple, right? I mean, obviously, Leo's cute, and he's outgoing in a way that I'm totally not. And his smile... it... It kind of edges up on one side and it gives me butterflies. All right, now, if you're gonna start with all that butterfly talk, I'm... I'm out. But we already tried this once, right? And we failed. So who's to say that we won't again? And with Jordi, on the other hand... Jordi has this twisted sense of humor and a very quiet confidence that I really admire. And... and he's bald. What? I meant "bold." It was a typo. Is that a spreadsheet? I find them soothing. Egyptian cotton is soothing. You're making work out of something that should be fun. You got two men fighting over you, woman. Enjoy it. But there's nothing to enjoy. Being forced to make a decision that I don't know the right answer to... 'Cause there is no right answer. You have to follow your gut. What does your gut say? Honestly? I'm having a difficult time understanding any of this. You know, I'm not really sure why either of them like me. I mean, I don't even like me. Well, if that's true, then you need to focus less on who you like and more on liking yourself. I don't know how to do that. Hey. Got a light? Oh, I see. You're trying to kick the death sticks. Totes respect. I tried that once. It was the worst 48 minutes of my life. Hello? Are you deaf? Can you hear me? It's cool if you are. I was blind once. I can relate. If there was ever a time I'd want to be deaf, this would be it. Wait a minute. I recognize that voice. You... you're the jerk that put me in the elevator. Don't smile like what you did was cute. It was a super-douche move, even if you look like that. In fact, I could report you. Be my guest. I'm serious. Have you met Nurse Jackson yet? She takes "Shawshank" to a whole new level, and she will demolish you and your sorry-ass dimples. If I was actually a patient here, that might mean something. As it is, I'm just visiting. Oh, yeah? Who are you visiting? Maybe I know him. My little brother. He has cerebral palsy. Something messed up when he was born. My mom felt so guilty about it, she took to the bottle. Last I heard, she was living out in Omaha. So it's just the two of us. Oh, my God. That's... awful. You wouldn't say that if you met him. I mean, he drools a lot. He can't walk, so I have to carry him around most of the time. I'd lay in front of a train for that kid. He's my whole world. Kara! Kara Souders! Do you mind? We're having a moment. Unh-unh. You are having surgery. You weren't supposed to leave your room. Shake a tail feather, young lady. And, Hunter, Dr. McAndrew wants you back on an I.V. Wait. He's a patient? You're 10 kinds of twisted, aren't you? 
 
 All right, so, we've removed the staples and fixed the dressing, so I think he's all set for discharge. Adam. Erin. Um... here you are. How are you? Uh... come here. Oh, it's good to see you. I've, uh... I'm... I'm so sorry. I've been meaning to come up and... And wish you congratulations on your promotion. It's not a big deal. Oh, don't be modest. It's huge. Well, I have been meaning to come down and say hello to you, as well. And now I have an excuse. I wanted to talk to you about Charlie Hutchison. Uh, yeah. That... that's... That's been a tough one. Brought in here... What's the deal with those two? You want the Cliffsnotes or the "Les Mis" version? I just want to know what their deal is. I don't need you to sing. ♪ You're loss ♪ They were adorbes. Met in med school and then hooked up when they both got jobs here. Their future reeked of a house in Encino and 2.5 kids, when, out of the blue, she got a hankering to do some good in the world. Isn't she already a doctor? How much more good can a person do? She packed up and moved to Africa. Asked him to come with, but life can be cruel. There are no happy endings. Fantasia can't read. And Nene might quit "Atlanta." Rein it in, Kenj. McAndrew said no. He was on track to make chief and didn't want to derail his career. But now she's chief. How did that happen? I'm sure Dr. McAndrew is asking himself that same question. Now we're just waiting on the blood and urine cultures. We'll know more then. I'm guessing you need the bed. We always need the beds. But I wanted to see how you'd feel about potentially bringing in some input from outside. Have you heard of a neurologist named Dr. Naday? Yeah, I have. Uh, that... that seems like a complete waste of time. Well, I'm glad to see you're as open-minded as ever. I'm open to you telling me one legitimate thing he's promoted in the field of neurology besides himself. He's with the neuro research institute. He's part of the brain mapping project. His TED talk went viral. He's had tremendous success with traumatic-brain-injury patients. Erin, he sees three patients a year. I'd look like a miracle healer, too, if I only took cases that I knew I could turn around. I'm only asking because Dena requested that we bring him in, and she knows Charlie's condition as well as anybody in the hospital. Jackson went to you with this? Don't turn this into a thing. It's your decision. All I'm asking is you think about it. Yeah, I'll think about it. This assignment is lame. Agreed. I can just, uh, do it for both of us. I don't mind. Thanks, but I'm good. Okay. It's no big deal. I mean, you haven't been in class yet. Let me help. As if I could ever trust you to help me. Is there something you want to talk about? I saw you and Emma kissing. Um... Look, it just happened. After you said to my face that you weren't gonna make a move on her. Actually,   you  said that. Because I thought our friendship was more important. What do you want me to do? Emma and I have a-a... have a history. You have a history. Oh, well, none of that matters anymore, okay? 'Cause she's gonna pick me. Yo, I'm going to see Kara before surgery. Any of y'all want to come? Sure. What the hell is wrong with him? Mandy had to go to work, but we were both freaked out. I mean, he's got an infection, right? I know Dr. McAndrew said it was nothing to worry about, but... It's not. Trust me. I've got everything under control. But what happens now? I thought they needed his bed. Well, they can go to the futon factory. Charlie's not going anywhere until he's ready. Can I steal Nurse Jackson for a minute? Erin said you approached her about bringing Naday in for Charlie? Look, I know I didn't follow protocol. You don't go to the chief without consulting with me first. I knew you'd say no. You've been very clear on what you think our course of action should be with Charlie. I went to Erin because I wanted a second opinion. I'm Charlie's doctor, not you. In fact, you're not even a doctor at all. You're a nurse. And my job is to advocate for my patients. Oh, come on. We both know what this is about, right? You made a promise to Charlie, you couldn't keep it, you feel guilty, and now you're yelling at windmills. What's the big deal if Naday comes? Why are you so against it? Because it is a waste of time and resources. And those parents have been through enough, and I don't want to give them false hope. Is that it? Or is it that you don't want another doctor here that can do in one day what you haven't been able to do in months? You think this is about my ego? That's what it's always about with you. That's why Erin got your job... Because she can see past herself. She can let someone else have a good idea. That's why she's chief and you're not. There is nothing in Dr. Naday's work that would suggest he could do anything more for Charlie than we already have. So if you want my answer, it's no. Shouldn't be much longer now. Why are you guys looking at me like that? You look like those creepy Harajuku dolls. I heard you got Dr. Khan as your, uh, anesthesiologist, which is great news. He's the best. I used this when I had my wisdom teeth pulled. Squeezing it's supposed to help with nerves or something like that. Oh, and Dr. McAndrew told me to think of a happy memory before you go under so that when you wake up, you'll be in your happy place. You mean I'll wake up under a Hemsworth brother? Okay, thanks for coming, people I barely know. Now move along. Hey, who's up for a little red band fist pump, huh? I will kill you in your sleep. That's if you wake up. So, you  do  have friends. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Just that every time I've seen you, you've been all alone. I was starting to worry you might be some kind of sociopath. Well, look who's talking. And, anyway, those people aren't my friends. They're total randos. Oh, my God. Could you be more of a cliché? Only if I were you. ♪ I'm gonna love you ♪

All I know is... I moved out here with my crappy boyfriend, and then he dumps me because I didn't want to be the person that I was in high school. I came out here so I could be more than that, and Dr. McAndrew sees me as more. Sweetie... You don't need a doctor to tell you you're gonna make something of yourself. I know I don't need it.

Thank you. I appreciate that. But, uh, we... we broke up over a year ago. It's amazing how long the pain lingers, right? I think that's because people live in their regrets. But once you stop obsessing over the coulda, shouldas and take your ego out of it, you face the facts. And maybe the fact is that you two were just wrong for each other. Wait a second. That can't be right. Oh, you're right. You'll probably get back together. No. Look. Look. Charlie P.M. labs are completely different than this morning's. It says that last night's blood work may have been labeled incorrectly? That must be an accident. Nurse Jackson delivered last night's labs, so... Nurse Jackson did? Uh... I thought so, but maybe not. Nurse Jackson never makes mistakes. No, she's never wrong. Do you want me to follow up with the lab? I can see if Nurse Jackson knows anything. "Labeled incorrectly" my ass. Mom? Are you crying? No. It's these damn eucalyptus trees. They're killing my allergies. I thought you left. Oh, please. You may scare everyone else around here, but you don't scare me. How you feeling? I feel... pretty good, actually. Best drugs I've had in days. I'm kidding. Mom, please don't... don't cry. It makes me uncomfortable. Plus, it's dehydrating, and, at your age, you can't afford to lose any more moisture in your face. There. Laugh lines we can botox. And more good news. I think that this surgery might have helped me get on that stupid list. What do you mean? It turns out that the sicker you are, the higher up on the UNOs list you go. And my situation just got way worse. So any day now... No, sweetie. You've always been this sick. The reason that you're not on the list is because you're not a good candidate for a heart. What do you mean? You failed 4 out of 5 drug tests since you've been here. Well, I passed one. Not to mention your attitude is mostly horrendous. I've had two separate nurses suggest that we perform an exorcism on you. So what? They want me to smile more? I can do that. I'm a freaking cheerleader. I'll be cheerful. I think it takes real change, Kara, which none of your doctors seem to think you're capable of. Lord knows I've never been capable of it. You used to be straight, mom. I'd say you've changed a lot. True. But that was all because of Daniella. Sometimes, you just need someone you want to change for. So, just like pride almost extinguished Darcy and Elizabeth's love... And it destroyed the former Soviet Union, Blue Dog Democrats, and a Duck Dynasty, so let that be a lesson to you all. Thank you, Emma and Dash. And moving on to prejudice, we have Leo and Jordi. If Jane Austen was here today... in modern society, prejudice takes many forms. Jane Austen would find that, um... That prejudice is still very prevalent in cultural bias. The physically challenged, for instance. Let me finish. Apparently, there's some confusion as to who goes first? I've often experienced... Most of us in this room... Are you gonna let me finish a damn sentence or do you always have to have your way? You got a problem with me, man? Just say it. I'm pretty sure I just did. What does your spreadsheet say now? Talk about Pride. You're the most arrogant... Gentlemen... Because... What? Are you scared of me? As if I'd be scared of a gimp. Oh!

I'm definitely not interested in your pity right now. It's not possible to pity someone you hold up on a pedestal. Look, we don't have to do this, Emma. You couldn't have been clearer. How was I clear? I didn't even say anything. Exactly. You haven't even looked at me all day. Well, that's because you gave me this weird ultimatum, and it's been stressing me out. It wouldn't have stressed you out if you were into this. I... that's the problem. I'm  too  into this. Leo, I'm terrified of how into you I am. I spent the whole day compiling data and making spreadsheets, just trying to come up with a reason not to choose you. But no matter how I crunched the numbers, it just kept adding up to you, and I didn't want it to. So, uh... So, what do you want to do? Hmm? I want to do this. ♪ Just as long as you gonna get home ♪

Yes, I go to boot camp every day. But you're supposed to be in bed, young lady. I know. I know. I'm just wondering how that surgery went for that guy who had the... Air quotes... liver transplant. You mean Hunter? Exactly. That guy. Kara, you know I can't discuss a patient's medical condition. Oh, my God. Did he really have a liver transplant? Wait. You look like something bad happened. What is it? Is he dead? Why do you care? I don't... care. I can see that. Whatever. You're the one who left your stupid toothpicks in my room. Oh, don't even try and act like you didn't. You're the only one... wait. Did you have surgery? You have a peculiar habit of talking to yourself. I'm guessing it's 'cause no one else wants to talk to you. I have to be going now. Good night.

She's probably working out her algorithms right now as we speak. I don't care. All right? I'm sick of them. I'm sick of this place. I'm sick of being sick. You think any of us want to be here? No. But we got to help each other get through it, man, stick together, band of brothers. I don't need your philosophizing right now, Dash. I want to be alone. Come on, now, J-man. Everyone needs a friend, right? Does that answer your question? I talked to Erin, and I told her that I think we should bring Naday in. He's coming in this week. Are you serious? Erin's making all the arrangements. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! Don't thank me. You did this. You did all of this. Still, you're the one who had to make the decision. I'm just so relieved you did the right thing, Adam. Well, that's my job, right? Do the right thing? Which is why I had to report you for falsifying Charlie's lab work. How did... I knew you wanted to buy Charlie more time. And the only one in this hospital with a bigger ego than me is you. You're suspended. ♪ There's a fine line between love and hate ♪
