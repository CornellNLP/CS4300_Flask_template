 Previously on "Red Band Society"... 
 You're burning up. 
 No, no. I'm just a little warm. 
 Are you sure? 
 [Gasps] Hunter, Hunter! 
 My job is to protect your heart, Kara, in every possible way. 
 Emancipation seems like an appealing option. 
 All we need is the filing fee. 
 $395. 
 Kara : Oh, my God, is that Delaney Shaw? 
 I was wondering if you'd be comfortable introducing me to your manager. 
 I will give you 10 minutes for 10 painkillers. 
 Dr. McAndrew : I was kind of thinking  - this is like a one-time thing, you know? 
 Brittany : I don't. Haven't you ever had a one-night stand before? Ow! I had my meeting with Dr. Samuels, and she said that I could go. Emma, you can't go. You're still sick. You can't just leave! All packed up? Dad, this is Leo. Pleased to meet you. Leo, is it? Charlie : The great philosopher Tupac Shakur once said, you can spend minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even months overanalyzing a situation, trying to put the pieces together... Or you can just leave the pieces on the floor and move on. There may have been some swear words in there, but that was the gist. I just can't believe she left without saying goodbye to anyone. She said goodbye to Leo. Somewhat. Yeah, but to just take off? That's not like Emma. That sounds exactly like Emma. She's all about being elusive. You thought that you knew her, but you didn't. None of us did, which is exactly what she wanted. Give it a rest, Kara. Why? You think I'm wrong? I think no one's interested in listening to your crap today. Testy. Did she say anything to you, Leo? I'm not better, okay? I'm not better! And I keep waiting for someone to figure that out, and they don't! Not really. Who picked her up? Her dad. I don't think her mom has been here since she was first admitted. Seriously? I didn't know that. Like I said, we don't know Jack. Shut up! Shut the hell up for once in your life! I just... I can't imagine this place without Emma. Me neither. I guess someone had to be the first go. Which begs the question... Who will be next? Knight to C3. [Click] Your move, little man. Now would probably be a good time to tell Dr. Naday I don't know how to play chess. [Clicking] You want me to move your prawn to D5? Charlie : I'm also not the best typist. Pawn to D5. Good. Okay. Pawn... D5. [Click] You know you want to hit that, right? I do. I really do. All right. I'll help you out. All right. Now... All you have to do is move that finger there. Good morning, Charlie. Dr. Naday. - [Clicking] Morning. Charlie says... [Chuckles] "Good morting noose Jaskon." [Chuckles] I'll take it. You know, I... Still don't understand how all this works exactly. It's an eye-tracking device. It uses gaze interaction to replace the standard mouse. It's calibrated to Charlie's eyes. Let me rephrase. I'm happy that it all works  and that I don't have to understand. I see we have a luddite among us. Oh, not entirely. I do own a smartphone. Really? Good to know. So, uh, what is the end game here? Well, hopefully, this is just a stopgap measure until Charlie regains his full faculties. Right now, we're working on getting him to move one finger. Isn't that right, little man? I'm working on it. You're working on getting Nurse Jackson's phone number. There you are. Uh, Dr. Potter needs you in room 211. Oh, you can't leave now. Charlie's about to make his move. Actually, I think it's your move, doctor. [Pen clicks] She's here! Emma! Hey, Finn. Am I crazy, or did you get taller? Yep, like half an inch. I'm on the volleyball team now. That's so cool! Good Lord, I didn't realize you had so much stuff there. I guess two months is a long time. It felt like two years. There's so much I have to catch you up on. Finley, honey, give your sister a chance to breathe. [Chuckling] Come here, you. Hi, mom. Hey, honey. Look at your hair. It's gotten so long. Oh, yeah, I've, um, been growing it out. Probably need to get it cut. Oh, no, no, I like it this way. Finley : You have to come see my room. I got a ton of new posters. Come on. Come on! [Chuckles] Yes, she does. [Sighs] Hey, are you okay? Finn, don't pull on your sister so hard. Uh, s-she didn't. I just tripped. You sure you're not dizzy? Dad, really, I'm fine. Come on. Show me those posters. [Chuckles] She still looks thin. Ah, she's always been thin. Jordi, you have a visitor. I do? Who is it? Hello, sexy. Well, I guess that answers that question. Don't forget that... You have, uh, your first pet scan in about an hour, and, uh, Dr. McAndrew will... okay, all right, then. [Chuckles nervously] You kids have fun. [Sighs] As much as I'm enjoying this, I think you have the wrong Jordi. I don't think so. Delaney said you were hot, vaguely Latino. Delaney? Wait, a-are you a part of her team? Did she change her mind about letting me play for you guys? [Chuckles] I have no idea what you're talking about, and I'm not technically a part of her "team," but I was hoping I could get the "friends and family" discount? The what? Fine, I'll pay full price. But I want the good stuff... nothing generic. Hold up. A-are you here for drugs? [Chuckling] Dude, keep it down. I can't believe this. Get out of my room! Whoa! Why so sensitive? I'm giving you one more minute, and then I'm calling security. In case you change your mind. Uh, are you going to check on Hunter? Smart and pretty. Bring those babies up to a "C" cup, and you could be a triple threat. No, uh, you can't go there right now. Why not? It's not bad. It's just not a good time. Dr. McAndrew's in there, talking to his parents. It sounds like the perfect time to me. The only way to find out what's really going on is when the parents are around. That's not true. Okay, it's sometimes true. But... So, how high was the fever? Got up to 103. Oh, my God. We did a chest X-Ray. We gave him some blood tests. Everything has been reassuring. There's no sign of infection. So, what caused the fever? We stopped one of his medications that we gave him on admission where fevers are a known side effect. Uh, he's been afebrile so far today, so my guess is that was the culprit. You guys need to relax. I feel totally fine now. Aside from the bunk liver and the life-threatening illness, I am the picture of health. Can I just ask, w-what's my son still doing here? I mean, I know we're waiting on a new liver, but since we have no idea when it will come... we just... just want to take him home. Unless you can give us a reason not to. Just want to keep my eye on him for a few more hours, make sure that fever doesn't creep back up, but after that, you know, it's completely your decision. [Sighs] I mean, it's up to you... wherever you feel more comfortable, honey. I want to go home with you guys. [Sighs] Great. Then dad will go deal with the paperwork, and we'll get you home... today.

Kara. All right, what's up? Can we talk for a second? What about? You know that I don't want to leave, right? I'd much rather spend whatever days I have left on this earth making rotten banana jokes with you. It's just my mom... Oh, my God. Please don't get all Nicholas Sparks on me. This is so not a conversation we need to have. I want to have it. I don't! You're angry. I get it. No, I'm not angry. In order to be angry, I'd have to care. No offense or anything, but... I barely even know you. This was just a hang. Okay. Cool. Have a nice life, Hunter Cole. Yeah. You too. Anyway, uh... Anyway, I'm rambling now. Call me when you get this. I just want to... I just want to hear your voice, make sure y-you're, uh... You're okay. Emma, I-I-I... I miss you. [Sighs] Dear God, man, have you no shame? I'm just checking in on her. No. You're just stalking her. You need to get a grip before this turns into the tragic movie of the week... "Mother, may I sleep with cancer?" You're, like, on steroids today. What is your problem? Everything! Where are you going? Out. Out where? Out of this freaking hospital. I'm taking a senior ditch day. You asked Nurse Jackson? No, Leo. Asking Nurse Jackson would defeat the purpose of a ditch day on every possible level. Okay, so, um, what, you have a car? I'm from Beverly Hills. I have two cars, one of which is on its way. [Elevator bell dings] Okay, I'll make a deal with you. I won't tell Nurse Jackson anything if you give me a lift to Emma's house. [Scoffs] You are such a whiny bitch! You have five seconds. Just get in. [Sighs] [Drawer opens] [Sniffs] [Knock on door] [Spraying] Hey. How's it going? Fine. You need anything? Nope, I'm good. Thanks. When you're ready, we should talk about school and all your extracurriculars. I-I've been thinking about it, and maybe you were a little overextended before. Yeah, whatever you think is best. I don't know what's best for you, Emma. I'm gonna need your help. How come you never visited me? I did visit you. In the beginning, but I haven't seen you in almost three weeks. Never mind. It doesn't matter. No, I-I-it d... it matters. It does. Honey, the first few times I came to see you, I felt like, oh... I didn't know what to say. I got so scared I was gonna say the wrong thing. The wrong thing would have been better than nothing. I don't know that that's true. [Sighs] I've been going to groups. Parents who have children with similar... You know, issues. I wanted to educate myself so that I could be better, help you get better. One of the moms, her daughter... Died. Can you imagine? I'm okay now, mom. You don't have to worry. The more I read, the more I couldn't stop thinking of grandma. Grandma? No, I-it doesn't matter. No, wait, w-what about grandma? Point is, you beat this. Emma, you did the work, and now you're home because you are strong. I'm so proud of you. How is "jem" not a word? It's a word. It's a word that starts with the letter "G." Not the doll. The doll starts with a "J." ♪ Jem is truly outrageous ♪ 
♪ Truly, truly, truly outrageous ♪ [Laughs] I know the song. I just wanted to see if you'd sing. [Scoffs] [Laughs] Hey, have either of you seen... uh, seen Jordi? Uh, he was here a minute ago. Did you need me to find him? Uh, no, it's not urgent. It's just, uh, Jordi's gonna be waiting on his pet-scan results, and I figured he could use a friend. Uh, well, I can check in with Jordi, make sure he's doing okay. Thanks, Kenji. Excuse me. Kenji : Are you looking for something? I swear I used to keep a lip gloss in here. I haven't seen you wear lip gloss since Madonna was relevant. Oh. What was that about? Don't you have any actual doctor work to do? Who am I kidding? [Chuckles] I still love my material girl! [Laughs] [Sighs] You're back. Uh, just checking in. I didn't mean to disturb you. No, not disturbing me at all. Charlie's resting. What's the prognosis? Any chance he'll be moving his index finger before the end of the day? It's important not to rush progress. It's gonna take time for the brain to wake up and find alternate pathways, especially when things have been the same way for so long. It's rather like getting back into a relationship  when you've been single for a while, as I have. Oh? He may be a genius, but the dude is not subtle. Well... [Sighs] For instance [Chuckles] asking someone out to dinner, uh, should be easy... just as moving a finger should be easy, uh, e-except when it's... Not. Well, you're the doctor. Whatever you think is best. For Charlie. Yeah. 'Cause that's what we were talking about. [Sighs] Kara! I'm so glad you texted. Not gonna lie,  it was a little hard to break into your room,  third floor and all, but mission accomplished. Your chariot awaits. Well done. So, where are we headed? What's the plan? [Engine turns over] Want to grove it up? [Tires squeal] Okay, uh... I'll just meet up with you guys later! Leo : All right, so, to get to Emma's,  we need to hop on the freeway, uh, which is that way. Kara, the free... the freeway's that way. Yeah, we're not going to Emma's house. [Sighs] ♪ Goodbye to my Santa Monica dream ♪ Go, go, g-o! Go, vikings, go! ♪ 15 kids in the backyard drinking wine ♪ Go, go, g-o! ♪ You tell me stories of the sea ♪ You gonna go and say hi to your friends at some point? They aren't my friends anymore. Okay, then what are we doing here? Watching the world spin madly on without us. Hey, you're gonna be back out there before you know it. Don't worry. I'm never going back to this school,  even when I leave the hospital... if I leave. Of course you're gonna leave. Unless I die there. What is wrong with you? Did they switch your meds or something? What do you care? I don't, but since you dragged me out here... No, I never invited you. You crashed this party. Some party. Look, if you don't want to come back here, you can always transfer to a different school, resume your reign of terror on a new pack of unsuspecting cheerleaders. Not interested. Really? Really. I just don't think I have it in me anymore. [Scoffs] God, I'm not interested in anything anymore. Well, except Hunter. For what it's worth, I know exactly how you feel. I have no idea what I'm gonna do when I get out of the hospital. Oh, my God. What, I'm not allowed to have an existential crisis? No, you're not. Why not? 'Cause it's so painfully obvious what you're gonna do. Everyone knows it but you. As usual, I have no idea what you're talking about. Come on. I'll show you. Where are we going now? Not telling. This is starting to become a thing with you. [Whistle blows] [Cheerleaders cheer] You okay, Dr. Naday? Yeah, couldn't be better. Would you like me to grab a magazine or something to read while you eat? [Chuckling] Oh, no, no, I'm fine. Thanks. At lunch, I like to take a break... A-a real break. I like to cleanse the palate of the mind. Do I look strange? Hey, if it doesn't bother you, it doesn't bother me. [Chuckles] But I'm beginning to understand why you're single. [Chuckles] Then again, I've been single for a while myself, so... It's easy to get stuck in a rut. Well, if you're worried about my reputation around here, you... you could join me. Oh, no, no. I like to bring my lunch from home. I like to cook. And I like buying cookbooks, just haven't graduated to the next level yet. You should come over sometime. A home-cooked meal is very important... I'd love to. Okay, then. I-it's a... Date. Great. Uh, hey, dad, can I talk to you for a second? Sure thing. What's up? It's about grandma. Um, mom said something earlier. [Sighs] Sweetie, this is a larger conversation. We should wait until your mom gets back from the market. Come on, dad. Talk to me. We think it's... Possible your grandmother... May have suffered from similar... [Sighs] You think that grandma was anorexic? Your grandmother was always very conscious of her weight and... Skinny since the day I met her. But I don't think it would have ever occurred to me until she passed away. Why? W-what happened then? Well, your mother and I went to clean out grandma's apartment. And when we were going through her things... we found old food hidden away everywhere. Sandwiches she'd never eaten. Untouched candy, stale cupcakes. It indicated a larger problem and, in retrospect, a lot of things started to make sense. How, um... how could you not tell me about this before now? We talked about it. Dad, I have felt so alone for so long. I didn't know why this was happening to me. And all this time, there's been a reason. Caroline : There's no reason. What are you talking about, mom? Anorexia is a disease. Just like alcoholism or drug addiction, there's a genetic component. Why would you keep something like this from me? Because I wasn't about to give you permission to be damaged. What?! Caroline... As soon as you identify this as a disease, something you were born with, it makes you less likely to try and change it. You start to think it's out of your control. I don't believe this. Honey, you're upset now. But one day, you'll understand. Honey... no, I will never understand you, mom!  I hate you! What... Emma. [Stammers] 
 
 [P.A. Beeps] I'll meet you guys outside? Yeah, we'll pull the car out. Hey, Hunter. Safe drive home. Stay out of trouble. I'll do my best. It was nice meeting you, man. You too. Fight the good fight. Yo, man, tried to call Kara, but she would not pick up her phone. Oh, it's okay. I have a feeling Kara isn't big on goodbyes... another thing we have in common. Yeah, she's not that great with saying "hello" either, but... [Laughs]... You had her all turned around. She's gonna be all adrift now that you're gone, man. Good thing she's got you guys. [Beeping] [P.A. Beeps] [Indistinct talking over P.A.] Well, see you maybe. See you maybe. [Beeping continues] What is that? Oh, my God. What the hell? What's going on? It's my UNOS pager. What's that mean? That means that homeboy is not going anywhere! New liver flying in, people! New liver! That's a good thing! Oh, my God! E.T.A. on Hunter's liver? Flying in from Sacramento now. Hunter's being prepped, and Dr. King is on his way. Anybody have anything else they want to talk about? Huh. That's fine. Perhaps now would be a good time for me to perform a moving rendition of "Papa, can you hear me?" I slept with McAndrew. You what?! You what?! Unh-Unh, me first. Have you lost your damn mind? Apparently. But when? How? Was it good? Nope, not even asking that. You're no fun. Seriously, what were you thinking, Brittany? I-I was thinking he liked me, and I liked him, a-and we had this back-and-forth thing going on for a while with granola bars and other stuff, and... I liked him. So... What's happening now? Are you two dating, what? [Scoffs] No, nothing's happening. It happened, and... It's over. Well, that explains the weirdness. What weirdness? There's been weirdness. [Sighs] Am I crazy? I mean, didn't it seem like he was kind of into me, too? Yeah. But that's not the point. You know as well as I do office romances never work. But... Pam and Jim are fake. Fake! All right, what these scans indicate is a partial response. Your... your tumors have shrunk, but not as significantly as we would have hoped for. Well, that sucks. It doesn't suck as much as it could have sucked. Now, look, it's my job to inform you that attempting to surgically remove tumors that are that invasive would be considered risky. Most doctors would probably suggest that you go through another cycle of chemotherapy. Oh. But... I'm not most doctors. I've handled tumors this size before. And if you're up for it, I want to go back in. But I want you to think about it. I want you to talk to some others doctors here. I don't need to talk to anyone. You're my doctor. I trust you. All right. I'll see if I can get this on the schedule for tomorrow. Tomorrow? Do you have plans? I do now. Thank you so much. Who knows? Maybe I'll be next. Next for what? Next to go home. This was oddly difficult to find. What are you doing? Reminding you who you are. I'm not playing soccer anymore, Kara. I made that decision a while ago. It was your doing mostly. Just kick the ball, dude. Thanks, but no, thanks. I will take your transformer leg and bash it into your patchy skull. [Sighs] Now kick the damn ball. Have you ever considered being a motivational speaker? It could be your calling. Okay, move. ♪ And after all ♪ 
♪ These times ♪ [Laughs] So? How did that feel? [Sighs] Awesome, actually. Now, I want you to promise me something. What is it? When you go home, I want you to forget about all of us. Especially her. Just go home and never look back. Okay? I'm sorry, Kara. I don't think that's gonna be possible. Why not? 'Cause how could anybody ever forget you? ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ [Crickets chirping] Leo : Hey, Emma. It's me. I was hoping you'd pick up, but you're probably getting settled in. Or maybe you're still mad at me. I hope not. I'm sorry, Emma. I feel like an idiot for not understanding what was going on with you. And for making you feel like you had to be something you're not. That's the last thing I wanted. Anyway, I'm rambling now. Call me when you get this. I just want to hear your voice, make sure y-you're, uh... You're okay. Emma, I-I-I... I miss you. [Sniffles] [Knock on door] Finley : It's just me. Come in. Hey, Emma, sh... Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Mom wants you to help set the table for dinner. Oh, I'm not hungry. You have to eat. I know. I'm sorry. It's okay. No, Finn, it's not okay. I never thought about how all this was affecting you. Are you really better? Trying to be. [Siren wailing in distance] What are you doing here? [Sighs] We're low on red band reserves, but no one goes under the knife without a pep talk, not on my watch. You take this stuff pretty seriously, don't you? I do. You know, when I first met you, I thought you were kind of a poser. Kettle, black. But I think I underestimated your leadership,  maybe because you underestimate it. You walk around like a number two, chief of staff to president Leo. But I think you've got it backwards. From where I sit, you're the one holding things together around here. Kenji : Hunter, I'm gonna take you upstairs now. I'm just gonna grab a chair. If I don't wake up, would you mind giving this to Kara for me? You can give it to her yourself. Thanks, Dash. Catch you on the flip side. So, what time is your game on Saturday, Finley? 3:00, but we're playing Lincoln, so we're totally gonna get destroyed. Oh, you will if you keep up that attitude. Hey, do you want to practice your serve after dinner? Sure. Maybe Emma could give you a few pointers. You were always great at volleyball. Haven't played in years. Well, it'll come back to you. You're not leaving until you clean your plate, Emma. Caroline... I spoke to your doctors, and I haven't given you any more than what you're used to eating there. Mom, this is a lot more. We can call them right now. May I please be excused? [Utensil clatters] No. This is our first family dinner in a long time, and we are all going to sit together... And eat. Like a family. Please, Emma. Try. Sure. [Chuckles lightly] No, no, t-that makes no sense whatsoever. I'm sorry you have plenty of... I don't have time to appeal your decision. Whatever course of treatment we decide we're taking needs to be implemented now, today! "I"ll get back to you. Oh, do not give me that bureaucratic crap. Just don't... [Click] [Scoffing] Oh, that's perfect. [Sighs] Sorry. You should be. Brittany, snap out of it. Excuse me? If I hurt your feelings or I misled you in any way, I apologize, but this is a hospital, and children are sick. So whatever's going on in our personal life seems pretty ridiculous by comparison, right? So either get over it or get out. All done? Just one last game of draughts before I head back to my hotel. Draughts? Sorry. You guys call it "checkers." Mm. I was beginning to think that chess may be too complicated. Actually, my hotel is just around the corner. You wouldn't like to join me for drinks after your shift, would you? We could discuss the menu for our upcoming dinner. Uh... Sorry, I-I-I can't tonight. Oh, of course. I understand. Actually, uh... I-I... Have a lot going on right now. I-it's kind of a-a bad time. I-I don't... I don't know what I was thinking this afternoon. Really shouldn't have offered to cook for you. Well, if you're busy... You're... you're busy. Have a good night. You too. You coming? Not yet. You can go in. I'm in no rush. [Sighs] I can't believe Nurse Jackson hasn't sent a S.W.A.T. team after us by now. I've been updating her all day. She knows we're fine. You've been... [Scoffs] God, you just can't help but be good, can you? Must be in my DNA. Hey, do you want to talk about it yet? The, uh... the fact Hunter's leaving. There's nothing to talk about. It's gonna feel like crap... Walking past his room and him not being there. The whole place is gonna feel empty without him. It's so stupid. I've known the guy, what, a few days? No, no, it's not stupid. It's not. I think it's a sign. You've changed. Whether you like it or not. Falling in... Love can do that to a person. You don't see it, but we do, you know? I do. I still don't want to go inside. What do you want to do? Kidding me?! [Sighs] [Lock turns] Okay. [Panting] [Ringing] Please pick up, Leo. Please pick up. Hey, this is Leo. Leave a message... [Breathing heavily] Okay, okay. [Coughs] Hey, what's going on? Is your leg acting up? Um, no, it's not too bad. It may be from lying on that machine for so long. All right, well, if you want, we can get you some pain-killers. No, no, I'm... I'm okay. Okay. What's up? I just got off the phone with your social worker, Megan. What about? Like I said, your surgery is risky. The state doesn't want to take any risks, especially with a minor. Emancipated minor. That's just it. You're not emancipated yet. I-I don't understand. Okay, h-here's the deal. California Children's Services will not allow me to perform the surgery at this time. They want you to go through another cycle of chemotherapy. No, what if I... what if I refuse? What if I say I won't do the chemo? Your tumors are gonna grow back. You don't have a choice, Jordi, until you're officially emancipated. And what if I can make that happen, like, immediately? What? How... how far along are you in the process? I have everything. It's just the application that needs to be processed. I can expedite that. Okay. Give me one or two days to see if I can make this work. All right, Jordi, you have 24 hours. I'm sorry, that's all I'm comfortable with. Y-your tumors are too aggressive. It's okay. No problem. I'll make it happen. All right, good. Hey, doc. My leg hurts more than I thought. Would it be okay... Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll, uh, I'll have Kenji bring you in something, and, um... Get a good night's sleep. I will. [Ringing] Alexa : Hello? Hey. Alexa? Jordi? Meet me outside the hospital in an hour. Oh, uh... I'm sorry. I-I thought you were... Charlie : Leaving? He was. But I have my reasons for wanting him to stay. Turns out the kid is much better at, uh, checkers than he is at chess. One game turned into two out of three, and then three out of five and... [Chuckles] "I won." Spelled "o-n-e." Good kid, bad speller. Hey, do I harp on your flaws? Busy day, Charlie. Is it okay to shut this down for the night? [Clicking] All right. It's amazing. For so long, I've prayed for him to open his eyes, and now that he does... It's not enough. I know. It's greedy. No. It's human nature. As soon as we get what we want, we want more. We push the boundaries. We test the limits. Someone asks to cook you dinner, and you ruin it by asking for drinks. Wait, that's not what... okay, I wanted to ask you to dinner... and Charlie wants to get better. There's just something blocking him. It's my job to find out what. Unfortunately, the same does not apply to you. What do you mean? It means I'm not gonna push you, Dena. If you don't find me attractive, then... No, no, no, no. That's not the problem. Then what is the problem? We work together. I've... Learned from experience when two people work together, it's better to keep things strictly professional. You know, to [sighs] avoid... Weirdness.
