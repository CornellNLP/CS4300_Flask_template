 Previously on "Dominion"...  
 It's the Morning Star. 
 My older brother. Lucifer. 
 It's the Amphora of Darkness. 
 It brings out the darkness inside you. 
 It drives you mad with visions to make you hurt yourself or someone else. Your humanity is hanging by a thread. Cut it. Horrible things I've done. My baby. I thought I lost you. [Willow cries] Alex? Where's Willow? Good-bye, David. You mean nothing. I will kill them all. The Amphora of Darkness. We need to find out who survived. God's wrath has never been unleashed on an archangel. [panting] [screams] Michael, he'll come back for me. No, he's forgotten you. Julian's army, they're already here. You're the master of all angels in New Delphi now. It's your army. Good. They will be another weapon to use,  but my brother's death will be by this hand when I plunge my sword into his traitorous heart. [dramatic music] [shouts] [grunts] Gabriel? The Darkness... it was you. Father may have gone, but at least he left his toys behind. What have you done? Gabriel, your eyes. The Darkness is inside you. Julian did this to you somehow. You're not yourself. Nonsense. Julian merely lifted the veil. For so long I blamed Alex for everything that's happened, but now I know who's truly responsible. You. No. We stood together in New Delphi. I haven't forgotten your sacrifice. [grunts] What are you doing? I'm going to kill you, Michael, and everything you love. I won't fight you. Good, then die quickly. [shouts] ♪ ♪ It's gonna get worse before it gets better, right? I don't know, Alex. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. Look at me. What you lost, there are no words, but I need you with me, okay? We need to get to Claire and make sure she's okay. Then stop talking and start moving. We'll check the suite first. [grunts] [gasps] Alex. Claire, are you okay? [grunts] No, Claire, don't... don't shoot. [softly gasps] You killed my guard. He was dead, but I don't know if I shot him, Claire. I don't know. How did you get out of your cell? I don't know. I woke up in House Whele holding a gun to my head. It happened to you, didn't it? What did you see? My worst nightmare. You're dead. [sobbing] I am so sorry. Please forgive me. Forgive me. You... you and Rose, you... you treated me like an eight-ball. You trained me to seduce David Whele like we did to her. I tried... I tried to resist, but I lost myself. It was... it was so... Real. More than real. What I saw was more like a dream... everything I ever wanted. She has my eyes, your chin, don't you think? Yeah. I got to find Alex. Claire? Will you trust me? [screaming in distance] [scoffs] Doesn't look like I have a choice, does it? [sobbing] Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shh-shh-shh. Don't despair. We all saw the worst things possible. What did you see? The truth. Vega must die. I can't go on. You won't have to. ♪ ♪ [gunshot] Get away from me. Stay back! Rough night, huh? Are you real? Flesh and blood. Whatever happened, it's over... for now at least. I saw things. You and me both. What matters is that we survived. You're David Whele. [scoffs] That's impossible. Yeah, yeah, apparently I managed to survive my own hanging, unless this is still a figment of my imagination. God, I hope not. What brought you here to the War Room? I... I was at my post. I'm a Comm Officer. Ah, a useful man. Well, son, if my eyes aren't lying, it appears our time together is limited. Noma. Claire? Alex? You're alive. You're hurt. No, I'm fine. [shouts in distance] You hear that? [shouting continues] Julian's army. [all grunting and shouting] [dramatic music] They'll hit the East Wall first. Sounds like they're a couple of miles from the wall. On foot, they'll be here in less than an hour. We don't have a lot of time. Tell me you have a plan. Nomes and I will cover the East Wall, look for survivors, arm them, and fight. Alex, there won't be enough. You two get to the War Room. We need the wall cannons online. It's our only chance. Okay, great. I know the codes. Arika and I will take care of it. Sooner the better. Once the eight-balls get here the walls won't stop them. Alex... I don't want this to be the end. We survived the Darkness. I'm not dying today, and neither are you. I saw... I saw our daughter. Her name was Willow. Willow? She was beautiful, and... Our daughter? I saw our future, or what it might have been. Alex, we got to move. I'll see you soon, okay? Be careful. Gabriel, stop! You've betrayed me time and time again. You were the one Julian wanted to kill, and yet I was the one he tortured after you left. I left to protect the Chosen One and Father's markings. I did it all for us, for the family! Ha! What has family ever meant to you, hmm? You betrayed our family! You gave your gift away. Claire, I'm not coming with you. I'm going home. Arika, I can't do this alone. You can. You're stronger than you think, maybe stronger than me, and this isn't my city. I... I need to go back to Helena. This is not about Helena or Vega. If we don't kill these monsters, that's it for all of us. Arika... please don't leave. Are you going to stop me? No. Too many people have died already. You want to go? Go. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yes, that's gonna leave them short _ by about a yard and a half. _ They will go for it. Father's gone. I had hoped I was wrong, but he really is gone. I wonder, if your most prized creation becomes your greatest failure, what are you do to? What are you talking about? Humans. They drove him away. No, that's not the reason. That's your interpretation. Funny, coming from a man gifted with what one can only assume are very important markings that none of us can read. Another gift from Father. Uriel and her beloved Apocrypha, the prophecies he gave Raphael, the scribblings on your body, tokens for one and all. That's what all this is about, you feeling left out? Ah, not at all. Father gave me a gift too. A seal? No, not just any seal. Lucky number seven, the apocalypse. I don't believe it. Why would Father entrust you with such... Power? Isn't it obvious? Gabriel, what are you doing? All we have to do is crack the seventh seal. The skies will open. Our kind will descend to cure this world of a dreadful disease: humanity. You'll start a war pitting humans against angels. You wouldn't. But it's what Father must have wanted. When the last human is dead, he'll return. He has to. No. No, Raphael's prophecy foretells a Chosen One. No. We must find him together. You'll forgive me if I don't put much stock in Raphael's prophecies. She has a rather spotty record when it comes to predicting the future. No, there is only one way to bring Father back, and it's in my hands. Gabriel, please don't do this. If you break that seal... no! [wind gushing] There. It's done. [panting] [screams] What have you done? [TV static] [grunts] [growls] [overlapping screaming] [tires screeching and alarms blaring] [overlapping screaming] [dramatic music] You broke the seventh seal. You started the Extermination War. The seal was made to be broken. No, you weren't meant to open the heavens. It was a test, a test you failed. No. You are wrong. ♪ ♪ Eradicating the scourge of humanity is the only way to bring our Father home. That's why he gave us the power to destroy them. No, you're wrong. Father wanted us to save humanity, all of them. That's why he gave us the Chosen One. Agree to disagree. [all shouting and growling] It's okay! We're human! We're human! Gotta take a chance. Okay. Still no sign of Michael. He'd be here if he could. We're on our own. The city is under attack by an army of eight-balls, so if you can use a weapon, consider yourself a soldier of Vega. You making yourself our leader? No, I'm not asking you to fight for me. I'm asking you to fight with me. We fight or we die. If you're killing angels, we're with you. Good. Take everyone with a gun and get to the walls, everyone. Here you go, sister. I've never shot a gun before. You'll learn. I'll show you, uh-huh. Come on, I'll show you. Okay, thanks. You guys with me. Let's go. You practice that talk in the shower? I haven't showered in two weeks. Let's go. Let's go. Yup! If we're gonna die... I'm glad I'm gonna go down fighting next to the man I love. Claire? [somber music] May we be in heaven a half hour before the Devil knows we're dead. You sure you won't join me? The bottle's almost empty. Suit yourself. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [pounds on door] Why am I not surprised the cockroach survived in the dark? Huh. Well, a year ago, I wouldn't have expected you to survive a bad cold, so I'm older and wiser. Older, anyway. David, I need to get in there. Yes, to kill me. Believe me, there is nothing I would like more. Look at the monitors, David. I need to get the cannons online. There are eight-balls advancing... Eight-balls racing at our glorious walls. It's the end of humanity as we know it, Claire. I'd offer you a drink, but it's a... it's a terrible vintage. Open this door. Otherwise I die, you die... and our city dies with us. Please. 
 
 [beep] System rebooting. I'm glad we've finally come to some kind of understanding. The only thing that I understand is that you're a murderer. [all shouting and growling] [dramatic music] My baby is dead. You killed her. Ah! Do you know what it's like to lose a piece of yourself, your reason to fight, your reason to live? Two of my children were murdered on the first day of the war. They were torn from my wife's arms, but I found solace in building this city. I poured my love and energy into it, and this city became my child. I gave far more to this city, to Vega, than I ever did to my surviving son. You remember him? William? The son you ordered me to put to death? But the day I left William out in the desert was the day that I destroyed the last piece of hope in myself. I just wasn't honest enough to lie down and stop breathing. I am sorry for everything I have done. I hate you. You're not worth it. Oh, sh1t. [all shouting and growling] They're over by the Luxor. That's outside the walls. They can stay there as long as they like. Who cares? We do. There's a tunnel right underneath that bus that leads straight into Vega. Uh-oh. ♪ ♪ [all shouting and growling] All I did, I did for you, to keep our family whole, and to keep you by my side. [shouting] Please, wait. Stay with me. Where are you going? To find the Chosen One. There is no Chosen One! Damn the prophecy! He's destined to be a savior! Or a destroyer. Don't forget that. And that's why we must guide him. Noma, go! Find him. Michael, please. What are you doing? It's too late. The lower angels are here. Their work will soon be done. Then you have to stop them. No, never! Then I will. We were meant to work together! Why don't you believe me? What you've done cannot be undone. The child's our only hope now. I cannot do this alone! I need you. Don't leave me. You brought this on yourself. Michael! Mike! [laughs] [all screaming and growling] What's taking so long to get the wall guns working? sh1t. The system froze. Lucky for us we have a Comms Officer on deck. Can you help us? You're the Lady of the City. This is no time to stand on ceremony, soldier. Get your butt over there. Look, I don't know if I have... I'm serious. Sit down. This? Go! This is way above my pay grade. Well, consider yourself promoted. Can you do it? I'll try. Come on, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, calm down. We'll do this together. Where are you going? Communications are down. I need to tell Alex. We can stop them breaking through the tunnel. And David, I need those cannons up and working. Can I trust you? Yes, you can. Okay, what's your name, son? Jerry. Well, Jerry, you heard her. We need to get these cannons online. It's our only hope. [all shouting and growling] Daria? Are you... Dr. Eli, are you okay? Where's Daria? Gone. She ran out of here screaming. What happened? What are we gonna do? We're going home. Claire, what is it? New problem. There's a tunnel that runs underneath the Luxor directly into Vega. Let me guess. The eight balls found it? Yeah. There's a gate in the middle, but it's not gonna last long. Let's go. Yeah, I'm gonna need a bigger gun. Hold on. Hold on what? I'm not staying here. Claire, you're wounded. There are eight-balls at our walls, in the tunnels. You're gonna need me. Let's move. Listen, Claire, I swore an oath to protect Alex, but it's more than just an oath. Yeah, I get that. Look, if something happens, if I fail him... You won't. Yeah, but if I do, I need to know that you'll do anything to make sure Alex is safe. I will. Anything. Let's go, let's go! [dramatic music] How's it going? Uh, it's complicated. Uh... [beeping] Wall cannons activated. [cannons whirring] We're online? Yes, we are. Now what? Now we bitch-slap some eight-balls. I can do that. Can I do that? This one's yours. It's easy, just... you move the target with your finger and hit the red "fire" button. All the cannons are fully loaded. That's your side. Oh, okay. Okay. Turn the console on. Um, oh... Line up the target with your finger and hit the red "fire" button. [beeping] Ha! You're a natural, Consul. Well, thank you, Jerry. Keep shooting. [beeping] I begged you to stay! [grunts] When you left the bar that day everything changed. My angels had come to wipe out the planet. It was meant to be an extinction event, but oh, no, you crossed sides and made it a war, and I get the blame. All my angels came to my side but you, my own brother. You left me when I needed you most. You broke our family apart. No, it was already broken... by another... [spits] the archangel who chose humanity first, long before I did. Our brother is alive. No. [Laughs] [gunfire and screams in distance] The universe is rather vast. I've searched but never found its end. It's a magnificent thing but daunting in its breadth. ♪ ♪ And yet never once have I felt alone... [tires screech and car crashes in distance] Until now. ♪ ♪ That was fast. The trail led to a house. And Michael? I sent him in the wrong direction. That serves him right for trusting you, but we know better, don't we? This is the only way to bring our Father back. Take me to the child. What are we gonna do with him? Why, kill him, of course. When the boy is gone Michael will come back to me. Check this out. [beeping] Down they go! [laughs] There is a perverse kind of joy in seeing them blown apart, isn't there? ♪ ♪ [laughs] Hey! Oh, I think I might have missed my calling. Me... [gunshot] Hello, Daddy. Claire's at my back. Got it. [dramatic music] Be careful. These halls aren't safe. ♪ ♪ [sniffles] [whimpers] My Queen, we don't have time for this, please. Don't leave, please. She's Vega's problem, not ours, collateral damage. Helena is the only thing that matters. We must fly. You sound like someone I used to know. Who? Me. Come. Take her with you to the helicopter. But... Now. Gabriel, please listen to me. Our brother is alive. What did you say? The Son of Morning, he lives. Lucifer? [all shouting and growling] Fan out! Stay close. They're gonna break through! The gate's not gonna hold much longer. There's a town called Mallory... untouched by the war, and the people there, they hear a voice, and they think it's God, but it's not Father. I think Lucifer's the one responsible, but I don't know how. No. Gabriel, I met a man who claims to work for him, and Alex has a new marking. [scoffs] A marking of what? Tell me. What did you do? I thought I was the Chosen One, but turns out I'm not. Alex Lannon is the Chosen One. He stole everything from me... my wife, my destiny. This man who you just killed was helping to defend our city. We were stopping eight-balls at the wall. Gabriel, Claire, and Alex all came to me, stripped me of my illusions. I wasn't saved by God. I wasn't special. I'm not worthy! It was just a story I made up. William, what you saw, that... that was... that was the illusion. It was like a nightmare. No, it's okay. It was necessary. I've realized it doesn't matter that I'm just a man. I can still fight evil. Tell me you got a plan. My plan? To make it out of this city one last time. [laughs] Outside these walls? Are you crazy? Desert dandelions in full bloom. You want to see them, right? Yeah! So we jump in the truck, hit the open road, and never look back, eh? Like we always planned. Seems like a lifetime ago. Doesn't have to be. All we need is the truck. William, you need help. I returned to this city to cleanse troubled hearts. Look at me, please. But there's just so much sin. You don't know what you're saying, son. It's in all of them, too much for me to cleanse. Give me the gun, please. The only cure is to kill them all. What do you mean? No. What do you think you're doing? Don't you see? Everyone in Vega must die. That's the only way we can save them. William, I know this is hard to believe, but I want to help. Like you helped me by leaving me to die in the desert? And I have regretted it every single moment. Why do I doubt that? Because of every lie I told you and every mistake I made, but now I am telling the truth. I never should've left you in that desert. I appreciate your effort, I do, but it's too late. I'm opening the gates. No, it's never too late. Never too late. Look, you... you can't do this, please. Step away from the console. Please, step away. Do you forgive me, Father? Step away now. I forgive you. William, no! [electronic chime] [grunts] [alarm blares] [all shouting and growling] Let's go! [gunfire] Tell me about your Chosen One. Gabriel, please listen. Alex's marking, I've seen it. It's the Morning Star. Impossible. We annihilated him, you, me, Raphael, and Uriel. We did as Father commanded, but I think he survived, and now I fear he wants Alex. Alex? Why? I don't know, but if I'm right and this is Lucifer, he's gonna remember what you and I did to him. He was our first, the most powerful of us. If he lives, there's no telling what shape his vengeance will take. Hmm. [grunting] [all shouting and growling] [dramatic music] [alarm blares] [stammering] I won't let you kill everyone in this city. Get off! Aah! [alarm continues blaring] No, William! [grunts and laughs] ♪ ♪ Oh, forgive me, please. Everyone in Vega must die. I love you! [gunshots] No! I always loved you. No... you didn't. ♪ ♪ You can't defeat Lucifer alone, Gabriel. We must face him together! I don't believe you, Michael. I dare not. But if there is even a chance that Lucifer is alive, best I go to this town you speak of and find out for myself. But I won't be going alone. [gunfire] We're running out of ammo! Alex, there's too many of them! I'm out! Lannon, what are you doing?
