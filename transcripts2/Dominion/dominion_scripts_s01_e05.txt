 Previously on Dominion... 
 Sleeping with an angel will make you a pariah. 
 I was thinking, "What if we understood the archangel more?" 
 I would like reports on your findings as you receive them. 
 Edward, I know you go outside the city walls every few weeks. 
 Why? 
 I've missed you. 
 What is it you're not telling me? 
 I'm sick, Claire. 
 Join me as we prepare our newest member, Brother Paul. 
 [Bones cracking] 
 [Screams] 
 I've made a deal with my father. 
 He's gonna stop detaining innocent people and draw up a basic bill of rights for every man, woman, and child in Vega. 
 How did you manage that? 
 I agreed to marry you. 
 Alex, I can help you. 
 I can teach you, but only if you're willing. 
 I want to learn about everything. 
 [Whooshing, flapping] 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Grunting] 
 Is that all you've got? 
 You failed. 
 No, I got this. 
 Let's go again. 
 The lesson is over, Alex. 
 Yeah? Is it? 
 Because we've been out here all day. 
 I still don't know what it is you're trying to teach me. 
 I know how to shoot. 
 So how do you explain this? 
 I went easy on you. 
 What did you expect? You gave me live ammo. 
 'Cause I was certain you'd have no chance of hitting me. 
 You're a soldier. 
 You've spent years honing your skills, and in just a few hours, I made you forget them all simply by provoking you. 
 That is bullshit. 
 Each time I attacked you, I used the sun to blind you, but you kept firing. 
 Your instincts were screaming at you. 
 You didn't listen to them. 
 Look. 
 My shadow. 
 If you weren't so busy squinting at the sun, you could have used my shadow to track me for any number of counter-maneuvers. 
 I know what I'm doing. 
 If you knew what you were doing, that little girl would still be alive. 
 Hey! Bixby. 
 Her name was Bixby. 
 You're desperate to avenge those who've been taken from you, but desperation will only get others killed. 
 You must learn to control your emotions, or they will be the end of you. 
 Watch the shadows, not the sun.

 Father? 
 Father? 
 Sorry. What? 
 I was just asking if you'd like to say a few words... at the engagement party. 
 There must be some fatherly advice you'd like to share. 
 We're survivors, William. 
 We're not immortal. 
 Cherish your time together. 
 Alex... 
 What happened? 
 Michael's life lessons. 
 Did you... scatter Bixby's ashes? 
 In the garden under a jacaranda tree. 
 In the spring, it's gonna be full of purple flowers. 
 I thought she was gonna make it through. 
 Yeah, we all did. 
 The doctor said her injuries were just too severe. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I can't. 
 You're gonna marry William, aren't you? 
 It's the right thing to do. 
 Mm. 
 Get engaged to someone you don't love? 
 Alex, I had a choice to make. 
 I need to look out for the city. 
 [Whispers] Claire. 
 Oh, Claire. 
 [Whispers] Stop. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Footsteps running away] 
 Miss Riesen? 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh... 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 I was... 
 It's just all this lace and silk and a dress train a mile long. I j... 
 It's all too much. 
 But your wedding is all that the lower VS can talk about. 
 I'm sure. 
 "The Princess and the Principate." 
 Yeah, exactly what the senate wants to take people's minds off their own problems, a grand old wedding. 
 Yeah. 
 It's like a real-life fairy tale. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, it is. We are very happy. 
 It's a match made in heaven... back in the day when an eight-ball was something just to be avoided on the pool table. 
 [Ahem] 
 Consul. How are you feeling? 
 Please call me David. 
 We're gonna be family. 
 Wedding present. 
 It's early, I know, but, uh, I heard that a young bride is in need of something borrowed. 
 Thank you. 
 It was my wife's. 
 She wore it on our wedding day. 
 I really don't know what to say. 
 No... it's nothing. 
 Thank you. 
 It's beautiful. 
 How's your dad? 
 I heard about his heart. I'm sorry. 
 You have my sympathies. 
 Oh, well, you know, they're not necessary. 
 He's fine. He's stubborn as an ox. 
 Yeah, an inspiration to us all. 
 Yeah, more fight in him than most but, um, there are some who have their concerns. 
 Who? 
 No one knows about his heart, so... 
 Unless you've said something to someone. 
 Somehow Senator Romero has sussed it out, and you know her. She's like a dog with a bone. 
 She's pushing for a vote of "No Confidence" in the senate to force him to relinquish his seat. 
 How can she do that? 
 Putting our fondness for your dad aside, you must admit that she has a point. 
 How prudent would it be to place the future of our city in the hands of a dying man? 
 You're gonna support her vote, aren't you? 
 It might be what's best for Vega. 
 No. What's best for Vega is a strong leader like my father. 
 Yeah, well, we'll have one in you. 
 Me? 
 I heard how you handled that whole ordeal with Senator Frost. 
 Decisive, unflinching, but most importantly, you got the two of us out of there relatively unharmed. 
 I'm confident you're ready. 
 Come on, the people worship you, Claire. 
 They believe everything you say. 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 Because you may be Lady of the City sooner than you expect. 
 Best be prepared, huh? 
 [Over P.A.] The marketplace is now open for all V-designated... 
 [Background chatter] 
 [Beautiful Dreamer plays] 
 ♪ 
 Hello there. 
 That'll be $10.50. 
 [Gasps] 
 Please don't say anything. 
 [Groans] 
 [Crack] 
 [Thud] 
 When you were in prison, your markings spoke to you in a form of a vision. 
 Why then? 
 Because you were cut off from the world, from chaos and distraction. 
 You were forced to focus. 
 Close your eyes. 
 Okay, now what? 
 Breathe. 
 I'm breathing. Nothing's happening. 
 It might help if you stop talking. 
 Now... listen. 
 [Breathing deeply] 
 Alex. 
 Alex. 
 Bix. 
 Don't let them hurt anyone else. 
 Alex. 
 What happened? 
 Where'd I go? 
 Nowhere. 
 We've been here for hours. 
 What did you see? 
 Alex, what did you see? 
 Who I'm fighting for. 
 I had one of the wall guards pick them for me in exchange for a night off. 
 I wish that I knew you were coming by. 
 Well, then it wouldn't have been a surprise, now would it? 
 What's this? This is new. 
 [Beautiful Dreamer plays] No, I've always had that. No, no, I would recognize that. Have you been outside the hotel? I just went to the market. Inside Vega? How? The tunnels that you use to come and see me. I know that I promised, but I just needed some things. Did anyone see you? No. All these years I've been a very good girl, haven't I? When you're gone, how long is it gonna be until I run out of food or water? I need someone to take care of me. What about your daughter? Everything that you've told me about Claire, how kind, how caring she is, how she helps the V-1 children... Maybe she could help me. No, that's not possible. You're so wise, General... but you didn't think about all of this, did you? Or did you just expect me to die of a broken heart? That would be so much easier for you, wouldn't it? You know that's not true. Well, what am I gonna do? My kind won't take me back. They'd smell you on me, and your kind would shoot me on the spot. You made me believe that I was someone else, someone that I could never be, and now there's nowhere for me to go. I'll think of something. I will. You knew, huh? About the general's bad ticker? You knew, but you didn't tell me. I promised to give you information on Michael. This wasn't relevant. Oh, well, then perhaps we should add a clause to our little agreement. Well, no matter. Everyone's gonna know about Riesen soon enough, once we've tossed him out of office. By the way, I need your support on that. [Laughs] Please, you know I'd never support that. Yeah, I do, but I thought you might reconsider. You don't want everyone knowing about your little fling with Michael. Fallen angel, indeed. No, that's not gonna work. You already tried that threat once. But there's a cherry on top. Four of them, actually... Emily, Gloria, and Hannah and, uh, vuh-vuh-Veronica... though I suppose they're not really cherries anymore. Hmm. Good old-fashioned orgy, huh? Who knew Michael was such a love machine, huh? Shame you couldn't satisfy his appetite. But let me tell you this. If you don't want your little harem paraded out in front of the senate... 'cause they'd love to testify... you will do exactly what I tell you. [Clicks tongue] So to you newcomers of the church, what I'll repeat is this... Our trust, offered to a savior. Our devotion, a sacred vow we promise. Our secret prayers shared in his confidence. May the chosen one protect you all. All : May the chosen one protect us all. Thank you. Thank you. That's very kind of you. How could you preach this heresy? I thought I told you never to approach me in public. Get out of here. All this talk about vows... Have you forgotten your own to Gabriel? This is... [Grunts] my vow to Gabriel, to be his eyes and ears in Vega... [Groans] And you're putting all of us in danger. If you ever dare question me again... William? Go. 
 
 [Labored breathing] Claire. What a pleasant surprise. Yeah. So who was that? Just some poor, ragged soul questioning his faith. I was just about to come and find you. I'm sorry to hear about your father, his heart. I had no idea. Yeah, actually, that's... that's why I wanted to come and talk to you. There are people who are trying to use his condition against him to make him step down as Lord of the City. Of course. I guess I wished it would be beneath him. I'm sorry. No, you don't have to be. I need to convince your father to stop doing what he's doing. Is there anything that you can tell me about your dad that might help me? Are you trying to blackmail my father? No. Yes. I'm sorry, uh... You must think I'm horrible. No, no, I don't. I think you're a good daughter. Look, I'll go home and talk to him tonight before the party. I'll tell him to back off. I can be pretty convincing when I want to be. [Quietly] Michael. That's not why I'm here. You said that I should go find a good man, a man that I could have a normal life with, and what we have together has to end. Well, you were right. Yes. I can't see you anymore. It's for the best. Is that all you have to say? I don't know what you mean. Good-bye, Michael. Hey. Got any lipstick? For who? Who do you think? Autumn breeze. Goes with your eyes. Uh, I don't think so. Alex. Hey, are you okay? Fine. Yeah? You don't look fine. Hey, it's about Bixby, isn't it? Alex. Alex, I'm sorry. Noma, leave it alone. What are you guys doing? There was an eight-ball attack in the city yesterday... A shopkeeper. Found his body in a garbage bag. Yeah, I heard his head was found facing his back. Yeah, and the troops just went out to search for it. They got this. They're gonna need our help. [Ammunition clicks] I'm not gonna sit around if an angel's inside the walls, waiting for it to kill again. I'm not sure it's a good idea for you to go out in this state of mind, Alex. [Violins warming up] ♪ [Beautiful Dreamer plays] ♪ [End notes] Claire? Edward, I... Get out of Claire's room! I know that you're angry, but I wanted to leave her a gift, just a little gift. Not another word. You murdered that man in the market. He was going to kill me. You stay away from my daughter. You don't have long, my love, and when you're dead, no one can stop me from coming back here. [Gagging] [Snarls] [Clicking] [Clicking stops] [Door opens] I thought that this day might come eventually. W-what day? The day when you ask me advice about your wedding night. [Chuckles] On how to tame your little filly. [Laughs] Better have a drink. [Liquid pouring] I came to talk about General Riesen. Yeah? Bullying him out of office. Is that really necessary? [Glass klunks down] Necessary? No. Expedient? Yes. Opportunity knocks, William. The man's dying, and it won't be long before Claire and I control this city just like you want. She's finally starting to warm up. She trusts me. I'm doing what's best for Vega. Don't talk to me like I'm the senate. You're doing what's best for yourself and no one else, especially not me. [Glass thuds] I'm doing what's best for the family, our family... what's left of it, anyway. Who the hell do you think you are... telling me how to do my job? That isn't what I mean. What I... Yes, it is. You think you could do better? Well, let me tell you something, sonny. When you're made Lord of the City, you're gonna need my help. You're gonna need me to hold your hand all the way just like you always have. You know it, I know it, and Claire knows it. Warming up? Please. She's playing you like a fiddle. You are nothing without me. You're wrong. What I sacrificed for you would make your blood run cold... if you had any. You owe me, boy. Just how much, you'll never know. I am the man I am because of you, father. They still haven't found the eight-ball. It's time I join the hunt. I want you to cancel the search right now. What? Tell them it's a false alarm. I need you to handle this yourself. It's classified. Nobody in the city can know, not even the senate. I don't want there to be panic, especially not tonight. She must mean a great deal to you. You knew. More of what goes on in this city than you'd imagine. What must you think? You love her. I did once. Now... [Sighs] It's all my own doing. I'll capture her safely. No, no, look, this... this needs to end. I need her taken down. But you said you loved her. Please, don't let her suffer. [Over P.A.] Attention... Citywide curfew now in effect. Repeat... Citywide curfew is now in effect. Miss? [Gasps] Are you all right? Go away. Please go away. Alex, you heard the radio. They called off the search. Let's go grab a beer. Noma, someone was killed. Look, Alex, it's like a wall's up around you, and I'm on the outside. What aren't you telling me? Nothing. Nothing. You know what? It's not like you haven't shut me out before. Yeah, not like this. Oh, yeah, you have. Week after you came back from the desert, during basic? Alex, you don't want to go there. You went away for maneuvers. You came back. All of a sudden, I was a stranger. Forget I ever brought it up, okay? You know, I still don't know what the hell happened. [Distantly] Attention. Citywide curfew is now in effect. Repeat... Citywide curfew is now in effect. Finch found out about us, okay? Someone blabbed. I don't know who. He was gonna toss you from the Corps, and I couldn't let that happen. Why didn't you tell me? The Corps was the only family that you had. I couldn't let you lose it because of me, so I told Finch that I'd end it, and I did. You thought the Corps was more important to me than you? You met Claire right after, so... it all worked out. [Click] We've got a report on a body in sector 22. Anyone local? Lannon, just east of there. We'll check it out. Copy that. [Click] Alex. That's Richardson. It's still inside these walls. My mom used to have them. Really sweet smell, very much like tuberoses. Yeah, it's really nice. [Low murmuring] But why didn't she want to meet up in the Stratosphere as usual? Because, Emily, you're no longer welcome there. You all have to leave Vega. I'm arranging your transport to Helena. What? Why? Our nights with the archangel are over. And if anyone should ever ask you, they never happened. [Elevator bell dings] [Classical music plays] William, I'm jealous! [Music begins again] It's an engagement party, General. What is with the high security? Need I remind you we're at war? No. They're here to make sure that doesn't spoil a momentous evening. Welcome, William. Congratulations. Thank you, General. Where's Claire? Yeah, where is the blushing bride? Hello? I'm sorry, Miss Riesen, but... there's a rumor Consul Whele turned one of his maids into lion chow for stealing his silverware. Don't worry. No one's turning you into lion chow just yet. I'm not stealing silver. William left his speech up here somewhere, so, you know, I said I'd get it for him. You sure you don't want me to take care of this? You're gonna miss your party. Those little tiny snacks, usually better than the entrée. Probably almost all gone by now. [Applause] Thank you. Where have you been? I'm sorry I'm late. I had to rush across town to fix my dress. Don't be angry. Everything is gonna be okay now, dad. An engagement party without the bride. We missed you. Some entrance, Lady Riesen. Everyone, this way. Dinner is served. I'll be along in a moment. Go. [Classical music continues in background] Shall we, David? They say chivalry is dead. [Chuckles] My goodness, it truly shines. Mm, yes. I'll never do it justice, but I hope you're pleased. Very. I wanted to thank you for telling me about the senate vote and Romero. You understand there's nothing personal against your father. I'm just a patriot who... Yes, and so am I, which is why I feel the people deserve to know that one of their trusted dignitaries, a pillar of the community, is secretly working for Gabriel. What? You can't be serious. Who? You. Patriot, my ass. Everyone knows you're a snake. I really never thought that you would betray your own. This isn't mine. Oh, frame me? Really? You're better than that, Claire. Oh, please, David. Nobody's framing you. I found it in your study. Nonsense. You haven't a shred of proof to put this in my home. "Happy Birthday, daddy, from your three little ducklings." End table by the fireplace. No one is going to believe this nonsense. I'm a consul. And I'm the future Lady of the City. You said it yourself, David. The people worship me. They believe every word I say. So if you go after my father with Romero, I swear I will expose you for the filthy traitor that you are. You and I both know that this isn't mine. Father? You guys coming? Yes, of course. Shall we, David? I'd put it away. Attention, citywide curfew is now in effect. [Whimpering] Repeat... Citywide curfew... is now in effect. [Clatter] Did you hear that? There it is. [Thud, clatter] Noma, down! [Shrieking] [Footsteps] [Shrieking] Noma, cover the exit. [Water dripping] [Snarling] [Shrieking] Wait! Wait. Please? I don't want to die. You deserve to die. There's only darkness, and I'm afraid. I'm so afraid. You creatures... you've damned good people to that darkness. My friend. My father! No. I didn't fight Gabriel's war. That body... That's not your body. That's some woman's, some innocent woman! You killed her. I was wrong. Please don't kill me. I have a family. I have a daughter. [Overlapping chatter] [Tapping on glass] Claire would like to say a few words. [Clears throat] Thank you all for being here tonight. William and I, we are honored that you would join us to celebrate Vega's bright future, and, of course, the union of two of its founding families. Um... There is one person who isn't here at the table tonight, someone who I wish with all my heart could have lived to see this day. To my mother. [Glasses clinking] [Sinister version of Beautiful Dreamer plays]
