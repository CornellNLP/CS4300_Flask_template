 male narrator :  Previously on "Dominion"... 
 Sniper! 
 Zoe :  Trying to kill Claire Riesen destroyed any chance we have for peace. 
 Dr. Mitchell :  The added stress of surgery caused a spontaneous miscarriage. 
 Arika :  I sent a friend to join and take a closer look. 
 How did you find me? 
 I'm part of the rebellion, David. 
 It's a trap. 
 Only one of us is going to survive. 
 No, David! David! 
 [whimpers] 
 Gates isn't as good a liar as he thinks. 
 He's up to something. 
 One way or another, Gates Foley is a problem that needs solving. 
 The only chance for revolution is to burn them down. 
 William Whele back from the dead. I've been chosen. These are my markings. What you did for Alex was extremely brave. [screams] I did what I had to. Now I need to make sure he gets home to Vega. Your army, all eight-balls. Sleeping. They're preserving energy. I hope you didn't disturb them. The markings. They were trying to warn me Julian would attack Vega. [muffled explosions] [all shout] Ramirez, what's happening? You were wrong about the Lady of the City. Girl has a brass set. Claire sent the military? There are soldiers on the front line shooting at anything that moves. [loud explosion] What the hell was that? Mortar teams are shelling our bases all over the city. Damn it, Whele! Didn't your spy tell you anything? I don't think Arika is my spy anymore. Or maybe she's dead,  which would be the one good thing to come out of all this. No armory. No Agri-towers. This is the end. We have to surrender. No, no. If they get their hands on us, then we die, period. We are traitors. In case you forgot, traitors hang. No, this is not the end. We have one more weapon. You! All of you! When I was a V-6, the one thing I was afraid of was that you people would finally realize that you outnumber us five to one. You want to attack? We storm their lines with every body we've got. We break their barricades. We overrun their forces. We take the city! All of it! Yes, there will be casualties, but right now, it's the only way we're going to win this thing. It's our last shot! Do you think you can handle it? Yeah, I know where to hit 'em. Team one, you're with me. We need to get out of here. What? If Arika's been compromised, then she's gonna give me up. How do you know that? Because it's what I'd do! [indistinct chatter over radio] Carry him. Fly over the walls. I don't think that would be wise. I'll be fine, Michael. A few eight-balls won't stop me. It's not you I'm worried about. Vega's guns could fire on me as they would any invading angel. You'd survive. But I might not be so lucky. So let's keep moving. [roars] sh1t, an eight-ball! Run! [speaking native language] Down! Aah! Careful, Julian. You might hurt yourself with that. I'd prefer if you allowed me the pleasure. You know, you're standing up rather well under the circumstances. Your brother abandoning you, I mean. I told him to go. And so he did. Your very own twin. Michael, Father's favorite son. [groans] There's no favorites among perfection. Your kind never understood that. Well, we're all equals now in our absentee Father's eyes. You know, I really hope this doesn't  destroy you completely. God's wrath has never been unleashed on an archangel. But if it does melt your skin or burn you from the inside out, then I can always take your brother for a whirl. I'm not picky which archangel body I get. Menathas, I need your assistance. [grunting] This will never work. [chuckles] Oh, in an infinite universe, "never" is a useless concept. [rushed breathing] [screams] How are you, Claire? I was told you have information on David's whereabouts? [chuckles] You and Zoe were very similar. She was a murderer and a traitor. But also an idealist. Only she trusted the wrong person. [scoffs] Must be something in the water, huh? Zoe should have killed David when she had the chance. You should have, too, because if he was dead, your baby would still be alive. What the hell are you talking about? David was the puppet master and Zoe danced on his strings. When you met, the poor girl really had come to negotiate peace. She didn't know about David's plan about the sniper? Where is David? You'll find David in an old TV station by the Gold Spike Casino. And why should I trust you? Because if I'd known he was going to hurt you, I would have killed him myself. Why did you betray me? For Helena. [scoffs] [exhales] You must have inherited your tenderness  from your mother, Claire, because your father was a fierce pragmatist, cold and clear. He would do whatever he needed to protect his city. I admired that. So different from my own father. But you're not your father's daughter, Claire, just like I'm not mine,  for better or worse. Maybe that'll be the undoing of both of us. I've narrowed it down to an electrical fault in the fuel jettison system. How long to repair it? Maybe an hour. I'll be down below. Dad. A day and a half on the ground is a half day too long. Maybe we'd be better off on foot. Dr. Brent's not running anywhere. In addition to that wound, she's also bleeding internally. Now, if we were at home, I could help her, but... We should be helping our own people in La Jolla. These aid missions, they're getting too dangerous. Which makes them all the more important. [muffled explosion] Rohit! They're gonna get in here! We need to get out! This plane is our only way home. It's not our only way. We use her as bait. No. At least some of us will get out alive. No, the ends don't ever justify the means. Now, we will all get out of here together. [shouts] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I killed the wrong person. Claire, you couldn't have known... No, I couldn't have known, but that doesn't make it right. Zoe is still dead. Listen to me... No. I thought she took my baby, but she didn't. She deserved to die, but not for that. Another one of my mistakes. Was that eight-ball one of Julian's soldiers? Yes, he was dressed for the part. I don't get it. Suicide eight-balls? Why would a lower angel want to sacrifice their new body? Perhaps Julian promised them an angel body next time. Is that even possible? No. But maybe they don't know that. Who could say no to wings? Nomes... Shh. Julian's army. They're already here. Noma :  We'll never get through them. The army we found in New Delphi didn't wake out of their stasis. Maybe we can actually get through these guys the same way. Maybe. Maybe not. There's got to be hundreds of them. [snaps fingers] How's the darkness feel, Gabriel? Does it tickle? Or is it more like an itch you just can't scratch? Wow. Yes? We had Alex trapped, but then Michael showed up and they escaped. Michael. Headed toward Vega. Well, Alex will never get into Vega, trust me. Well, I am sorry to break up our little party, but, uh, business calls. I'll give you some time to ponder this darker side of yourself and think about your twin brother leaving you to this fate. [groans] [sobs] Ciao, ciao. What does Ramirez say? He's bogged down at the trench. We may have numbers, but Claire's got a hell of a lot more weapons. He can't break through. Damn it! Where are all those people going? I'll check it out. Carson :  You're David Whele, right? I was at the armory when it blew. Zoe stationed me outside on a roof. Well, thank goodness you made it out alive, son. I saw what you did. You left her there. I should have put a bullet in you when you ran off, you coward. [gunshot] How many people want to kill you? Now one less. There's a bunch of civilians over there. Looks like they found some shelter in a bar. Perfect. Let's go. I doubt even this new Lady of the City would shell a place like that. You haven't slept for two days, Daria. Save your strength. So they have an extra few seconds to hang me? You are tired or you wouldn't count us out so quickly. We've survived worse than this. You have a plan? It's already in motion. [loud thud] This is crazy. We're not gonna be able to fly out of here. Even if Hillary does fix this heap, I don't think we got enough road to take off. So we got to go. No. No, we won't make it. Not all of us. So we should all die instead of one woman? No. We do it his way. I won't let you kill us. [screaming] Hillary! They're in the plane! You guys, help! Help me! Marcus, guard the cargo door! Hillary! Help me! [screams] [shouts] Where's Marcus? He left without me. This was part of the plan? Shh. We must close the cargo door. [indistinct shouting and clatter] [shouts] There's 13... no, now 14 points of contact with rebel forces along the trench, but we're holding the line. [coughing] Are you okay? I'm fine, damn it. [hacking cough] Looks like everyone's holed-up here. I was called to destroy evil,  but I have learned that evil is everywhere. What? What is it? Out there... I was chosen to survive. William? To return to my home. To cleanse this land. You can see him too? Huh? Yeah. Why? Who is that? Each and every one of us. My son. Be careful, they could wake easily. So what? He sneaks these camouflaged eight-balls in at night? Vega only has so many eyes. But then what? He's hidden his army here for a surprise attack. Oh! [growls] [grunting] Alex! [all grunting] Michael! Michael! [groans] Michael! Michael! Noma :  What's happening? Alex :  I don't know! Alex :  Michael, what happened? What happened? [growling] We don't have time. We have to go! Michael! Michael, come on. [whistles melody] ♪ ♪ 
 
 [groans] Father's wrath was once your greatest weapon. You and Michael cast its shadow over countless poor souls and yet you never knew what it felt like to be under its influence. If only he could be here to share it with you. Aah! Michael... he'll come back for me. No, he's forgotten you. My brother, he loves me. [chuckles] Oh, Gabriel, no. Michael loves only himself. And can you blame him, really? He was Father's favorite. His brightest star. And you, Gabriel, what were you to Him? Nothing but a glorified messenger boy. My Father honored me with deeds of great importance. Like poor David? Your "son" who so bravely defeated Goliath, but then the King threw him from the tower. Because I failed him. Oh, no. Not you, Gabriel. David : [muffled]  No! No! It was Michael who didn't catch your boy when he fell to his death. [muffled shouts] [yells] [growls] [whimpers] Mike. [laughs and sobs] You came back for me. Yes, Gabriel. To thank you. Because of you, I'm free. But you will remain here. Alone. Forever. I'm with my true brother now. Alex. I finally broke you. [coughs] You did this to me. Yes. So what? You just wanted to watch me suffer? Is that your game? Oh, I don't care for suffering at all. Not unless it has a purpose. And you, Mr. Foley, well, you have a purpose. The poison I gave you moves slowly. With all the damage you've done to your liver over the years, I guess you have just under 36 hours,  but it's not an exact science. So let me hypothesize. If I let you out, then you give me the cure? Close. You let me out and fly with me to Helena. Once there, I'll give you the antidote. You'll be my guest, treated to all that Helena has to offer. We have need of a man like you, flaws and all. [coughs] So if I betray Claire and Vega, I get to live? I've always been impressed by the lengths people will go to survive. Hey! Get out of my way! I was here first. I need to see him. Hey, we all do! You don't understand! Stop! Oh, it's you. No wonder everybody's angry. It's impossible. He'll have what I'm having. Looks like he needs it more than I do. It's on the house. Savior's good for business. Where have you been? Right where you left me. William... William is dead. You walked your son into the dessert and left him to die, remember? I'm sorry. Seeing you... words... Save it. I'm not mad at you, David. Fact is, I'm grateful. Where would Jesus be without Judas? You know, being part-human has its perks. [giggles] But the novelty's worn thin. It's time for me to ascend. To once again soar over the oceans. Taste the clouds. I'll make a magnificent archangel. Michael was all you had left and I took him from you just like he took everything from me. But soon you'll be free to wander in darkness forever. [breathes deeply] Time to inhabit my new body. [guttural scream] New attacks at the west end of the trench. 30 rebels, maybe more. We can't let them breach it. Tell the army to hold the line. Any word on David? We raided the TV station and we caught a dozen rebels, but he was gone. Arika's intel was good. She sold him out. But knowing her, she'll have more cards up her sleeve. [coughs] Gates? You okay? I'm fine. I must have caught a bug or something. Listen. We are winning. It's almost over. Everything's gonna change now. Claire, I... Well... not everything. Even the devil himself couldn't stop you, could he, Lady Riesen? Let him try. [alarm wails] That's the outside wall alarm. Eight-balls? Now? They can't get in. Wait, that's Michael. Who's with him? Alex. [overlapping shouting] We're not gonna make it. We're not gonna make it. Michael's too weak. Then we fight. Get a battalion out there, now! Third Battalion's near the gate. Do it. Hold on. If we take them off the trenches, it'll leave the reactor vulnerable. Not to mention the food supply. This is more important. Claire. We can get reserves to the wall in a half hour, maybe less, and I'm betting that the archangel can take care of himself. But Alex can't. Alex? Your soldier, it's him, isn't it? He's alive. [sighs] Claire, are you sure about this? Colonel Blake, this is Claire Riesen speaking. Blake :  Ma'am? You need to listen to me really carefully. The Archangel Michael and Alex Lannon are at the gate. They're about to be overwhelmed by those monsters. Get there now. Blake :  Yes, ma'am. [vomits] [coughs] [clears throat] [breathes heavily] [groans and strains] Aah! [gags] [coughs] [groans] [chuckles] [wheezes] You worm. You thought you would take my body? Flush out my soul? I, Gabriel? I walked through the grass in the Garden of Eden. I who have watched rivulets turn to rivers turn to canyons turn to dust. I've seen civilizations rise and fall. And you thought you could be me? Your arrogance was your downfall. It left you open, created a channel for me to take control. Gabriel! Please! [screams] [all grunting] There's too many of them! Get up! They're on us! Activity on your 9:00! [somber music] ♪ ♪ man :  Keep going! Run 'em down! ♪ ♪ Sir, Archangel, welcome back to Vega. [applause] [metal clangs] Ready? Aconitum napellus. A pretty purple flower more commonly known as Monkshood. The Greeks called it Queen of Poisons. It's fitting, really. And you put it in my water. This is Foxglove. Also known as Digitalis. It was in your apartment. It's used to counteract heart attacks or bradycardia caused by the poison that you gave me. It's unpleasant as hell, but it really gets the job done. And this is your order of execution for tomorrow. I had Claire move it up. I didn't let her know about your little scheme because I didn't want to give you the power of black mail. If you thought that I would ever betray her, then you don't know me at all. And if you think I'm going to hang tomorrow, you don't know me at all. [door opens, slams shut] [gunshots] [angel growls] [speaking angel language] [trigger clicking] [whimpers] Aah! Unh! [speaking angel language] Aaah! [whimpering] [angel growling] Unh! I'll get Daria. I'm beyond help now, sweetheart. Unh! [sobbing] Oh. Marcus will pay for this. No, don't use your strength on revenge. Just get everyone home. But you are my home. They'll follow you. Just like they did your mother. But that power, use it well. I don't want power. I just want my father. [ragged exhale] Dad! [sniffling] [angel growling] [mechanical whine] [gunshots] Stop! Room's clear! [alarm blaring] Lock it up and get the word out. We've taken their power. You have questions. Ask. I don't know where to start. Ramirez took the nuclear plant. What? That's impossible. How? Lady Riesen ordered the troops off the trench. It thinned the line. That allowed Ramirez to break through. That's great. Let's go. No. You're not leavin' me. Of course I'm not leaving you. I want you to come with us. I have a meal coming. Join me. A meal? No. We've gotta move. That kid's crazy. That kid is my son. Give us a moment, then we'll all go together. [chuckles] [exhales] Looking for somebody? I'm looking for David Whele. And you're in the way. [breathes raggedly] Oh, Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel. You accuse me of arrogance... [breathes erratically] But it was you who stepped over me, the worm, thinking I was crushed underfoot, but... [breathes heavily] But cut me in half and still I live. [chuckles, groans] Ahh. [groaning] But... [grunts] [breathes heavily] [yelps] No. Where's Julian? Gone. We haven't found him or the body. [panicked breathing] He knew the city better than anyone. All the bolt holes. I will find him in due time. I should kill you, but I have a feeling you might prove useful. [breathes erratically] What are New Delphi's secrets? The army. The eight-ball army. Is this army loyal to Julian? You're the master of all angels in New Delphi now. It's your army. Good. They will be another weapon to use. But my brother's death will be by this hand when I plunge my sword into his traitorous heart. All non-essential military personnel are in lock down. All non-essential military personnel are in lock down now. I dreamed about you coming home, but I thought it was just a dream. Well, here I am. [exhales] Yeah. You're alive. So are you. I bombed Gabriel's Aerie. You couldn't have known I was in the Aerie. [exhales] It was a hell of a move. You... You almost got the b*st*rd. But I didn't. Next time. [sighs] Hey, what's wrong? I was shot. Shot? How? I'm so sorry. Sorry? The baby. They did everything they could, but... [cries] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Alex. [cries] I'm so sorry, Alex. I'm sorry. [sobbing] How are you feeling? Better. We fought so hard to get Alex back home, but to what? You did your duty. That's all anyone could ask. Was it my duty to return to Claire, too? Yes, but not for them. For Vega. Maybe even for our kind. [scoffs] I don't have wings. I don't have Alex. What do I have? [grunts] Michael. Mallory. Michael. [Michael grunts] Michael! Guards! [overlapping chatter] It's the prophet. The prophet's returned.
