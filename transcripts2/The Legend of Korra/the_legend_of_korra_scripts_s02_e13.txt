 Earth. 
 Fire. 
 Air. 
 Water. 
 Only the Avatar can master all four elements  and bring balance to the world. 
 - After 10,000 years,  harmonic convergence is here again,  and the dark spirit Vaatu is free. 
 Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya have entered the portal  to rescue Jinora's spirit. 
 Asami split from the group  and took the injured Tonraq to safety. 
 So it's up to Korra, Mako, and Bolin to stop Unalaq  before he fuses with Vaatu and becomes a Dark Avatar! 
 - Raava, nothing could stop this moment. 
 Harmonic convergence is upon us again. 
 - I'm not going to let you fuse with Unalaq. 
 You're going right back in that prison. 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 - Don't let Unalaq back in the spirit world! 
 - We're on it! 
 - Jinora. 
 Jinora's spirit, do you hear me? 
 It's your Uncle Bumi. 
 - Ah, this isn't working. 
 We can't just randomly wander the spirit world,  call out for Jinora, and expect to find her! 
 - We just need to employ the simple rules of tracking. 
 First we locate her footprints... 
 then we follow them. 
 - Do you even know what spirit footprints look like? 
 Do spirits even leave footprints? 
 Face it, your tracking skills won't work in the spirit world. 
 Let me try something. 
 Ommmmm  Jinora is over there. 
 I feel a lot of spiritual energy coming from that direction. 
 - We're in the spirit world. 
 There's spiritual energy in every direction! 
 - Enough! 
 We can't do this by ourselves. 
 We need a spirit guide. 
 There! 
 Spirit, hello. 
 I'm sorry to disturb you,  but I am in need of your assistance. 
 You dare wake me, human? 
 Humans in the spirit world  belong in one place only! 
 - Aah! 
 - Aah! 
 - Whoa-oa-oa! 
 - Oof! 
 - Well, that didn't work. 
 Now where are we? 
 - We're completely lost. 
 - Oh! 
 Uhh! 
 No! 
 - Huh? 
 I don't know if we can win this fight. 
 - We don't need to win. 
 We just need to stop Unalaq  from getting back in the spirit world. 
 Huh? 
 - We're walking in circles! 
 I've seen that same spirit mushroom five times! 
 - That's not the same mushroom. 
 - Yes, I am. 
 - See? 
 Even it knows we're lost. 
 - Oh, sure, listen to a fungus over your own brother. 
 - What's that? 
 - Mushroom, is that you? 
 - Nope. 
 Wasn't me. 
 - lroh? 
 - How... 
 where... 
 it's been so long. 
 - Almost 40 years. 
 It's nice to see you again. 
 - How did you know we were here? 
 - My friendly spirit fox told me you were lost. 
 I came to show you the way out. 
 - lroh, we are grateful,  but we're not looking for the way out--  we're looking for my daughter. 
 - I'm sorry to hear that, but you shouldn't be here. 
 Vaatu has escaped,  and darkness threatens to take over. 
 - I'm not leaving until I find Jinora. 
 - I understand. 
 But I beg you to be careful. 
 If you travel too deep into the spirit world,  you could end up in a place  where only the lost will ever find you. 
 - A place where only the lost can find you... 
 that's it! 
 I know where to find Jinora! 
 - I'm locking you away  for another 10,000 years, Vaatu! 
 - Unalaq? 
 Are you out there? 
 He must have gone home? 
 - Hello, my feeble turtle-duck. 
 - Aah! 
 - Huh? 
 - Don't let them escape this time. 
 - Are you sure this is the best way to find Jinora? 
 - Trust me. 
 Hey, you, spirit-- wake up! 
 - You again? 
 - I thought we were going to be taken to a prison. 
 - This is a prison. 
 - Welcome to the Fog of Lost Souls. 
 You will never escape. 
 - Aah! 
 - Stop! 
 . 
 No! 
 - We are now one. 
 - Now a new era for spirits and humans will begin,  and I will lead them all as the new Avatar. 
 - Well, I'm the old Avatar, and my era's not over yet. 
 - What kind of prison doesn't have any bars or walls? 
 We could walk right out of here. 
 - The Fog of Lost Souls is a spirit prison for humans. 
 I read about it in an ancient text. 
 The fog is actually a spirit... 
 - [gasps]  - That infects your mind and slowly drives you mad,  imprisoning you in your own darkest memories. 
 - How long can you be trapped in here? 
 - I am Zhao the Conqueror! 
 I am the Moonslayer! 
 I will capture the Avatar! 
 I am Zhao the Conqueror! 
 I am the Moonslayer! 
 I will capture the Avatar! 
 - Hopefully we're not trapped in here as long as that guy. 
 - You! 
 You're him! 
 The last Airbender! 
 - Ah! 
 No! 
 Get off me! 
 - You've grown... 
 but I will still defeat you! 
 Ah! 
 Ohh! 
 Come back, Avatar! 
 Face me! 
 I am Zhao the Conqueror! 
 I will capture you! 
 Victory will be mine! 
 [voice echoing]  - If we stay together,  we'll find Jinora and make it out of this fog. 
 Aah! 
 - Give in. 
 Your time is over. 
 - Korra, this fight is not over. 
 Raava... 
 - Vaatu cannot win. 
 Do not give in to 10,000 years of darkness. 
 You are the Avatar. 
 - Aah! 
 - You cannot win! 
 - Jinora! 
 Jinora! 
 - Wait a second. 
 - What? 
 Do you hear something? 
 - Yes. 
 They're all around us. 
 The cannibals, they're everywhere. 
 - Bumi, you must focus your mind right now. 
 There are no cannibals. 
 - Yes, there are! 
 They're gonna eat every last one of us! 
 Who are you two? 
 ! 
 - Kya, we're your brothers. 
 You must remember before the fog infects you. 
 - No, you are just a vision. 
 I have no family. 
 You can't tie me down! 
 - They're closing in! 
 I gotta get outta here! 
 Aah! 
 ' Aah! 
 ' No! 
 
 
 
 Bumi! 
 Kya! 
 Come back! 
 - Please, let us out. 
 - His groveling is pathetic. 
 - But I do enjoy the sweet scent of desperation. 
 - Come on! 
 Your dad has become an evil monster. 
 He's trying to bring on eternal darkness! 
 Why would you protect someone  who doesn't care about you at all? 
 - Father was going to let me expire  when we tried to open the northern portal. 
 Perhaps we should rethink our position. 
 - Yes! 
 - No. 
 Don't listen to him. 
 His words are poisoning your mind. 
 - What's with this outburst of emotion? 
 - I'm sorry, I can't help it. 
 It's just so sad... 
 that I'll never get to be with you again. 
 - What? 
 Explain yourself further. 
 - Eska, I've always loved you,  and I've always wanted to be with you... 
 but now that the world is ending,  I'm never gonna get that chance. 
 - We could have been together,  but you left me at the altar. 
 - I was scared! 
 I was scared of my true feelings for you. 
 I should have never left you! 
 I'm sorry. 
 And I'm sorry that we'll never have a chance to rekindle  the dying ember that was our love into a... 
 big fire of love flames. 
 - You'll never defeat my father. 
 But should you survive,  perhaps we can spend eternal darkness together. 
 - Wow, that was the best acting I've ever seen. 
 You completely fooled her! 
 - Yeah, right, that-- that was acting. 
 - They will certainly perish. 
 - I must stay focused. 
 Remember who you are, Tenzin. 
 You are the son of Avatar Aang. 
 You are the hope  for future generations of Airbenders. 
 The fate of the world rests on your shoulders. 
 But what if I fail? 
 Then your father's hope for the future dies with you. 
 I can't fail! 
 You will. 
 Aah! 
 Stop it! 
 I am the son of Avatar Aang. 
 I am the hope for future generations of Airbenders. 
 I am the son of Avatar Aang! 
 - Hello, my son. 
 - Dad, I've failed you. 
 I am no spiritual leader,  and I've let the world down. 
 I'll never be the man you were. 
 - You are right. 
 You are trying to hold on  to a false perception of yourself. 
 You are not me, and you should not be me. 
 You are Tenzin. 
 - I am not a reflection of my father. 
 I am Tenzin. 
 I am Tenzin. 
 Jinora! 
 - Ah... 
 what happened? 
 - I think our brother saved us. 
 - Dad. 
 - You're going to be okay, sweetie. 
 I'm here. 
 - What happened? 
 The last thing I remember  is dark spirits taking me away. 
 - You were trapped in the Fog of Lost Souls,  but I wasn't going to let you stay there. 
 - I'm so happy to see you, Dad. 
 - Korra! 
 - He's got the light spirit! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 - The world's in trouble. 
 - What are you talking about? 
 How do you know? 
 - I can feel it. 
 - What happened? 
 - It's Korra. 
 This light spirit will guide you out of the spirit world. 
 I have to go help. 
 - Jinora, wait! 
 - Now... 
 10,000 years of darkness begins! 
 Aah!
