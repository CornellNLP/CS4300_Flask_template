 Earth. 
 Fire. 
 Air. 
 Water. 
 Only the Avatar can master all four elements  and bring balance to the world. 
 Unalaq has forced Korra  into opening the northern portal  and trapped Jinora in the spirit world. 
 Back in Republic City,  everybody loves Varrick's Nuktuk movers. 
 Everybody, that is, except Mako,  whose pursuit of Varrick has landed him in the slammer. 
 And in the Southern Water Tribe,  Unalaq's army is nearing victory in the civil war,  but Tonraq isn't about to give up without a fight. 
 - Dad's back! 
 - Where's Jinora? 
 No! 
 - Her spirit is trapped in the spirit world,  but she's going to be all right. 
 - How could this happen? 
 - It was all my fault. 
 I should have never let Jinora  enter the spirit world without me. 
 I couldn't protect her. 
 - I'm so sorry, Pema. 
 I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me. 
 - Don't worry, honey, I'm not going to stop  until our little girl is back safe with us. 
 - You've got a visitor. 
 - Hey, Mako. 
 - Hey. 
 What's with the fancy duds? 
 - I'm on my way to the big finale  for "Nuktuk: Hero of the South."  Yeah, everyone's gonna be there,  except for, you know, you... 
 because you're in jail and stuff. 
 - Thanks for the reminder. 
 - Hey, I brought you something. 
 I thought this would brighten up your new place. 
 Read the inscription. 
 - "Dear Mako, Nuktuk says, 'Keep smiling.'"  Did you come by just to give me a poster? 
 - No, I came by to give you my sincere,  heartfelt words of encouragement. 
 I know our lives have been moving  in two different directions, but I want you to know  that I will always be there for you. 
 We are brothers, after all,  even if one of us is a member of high society  and the other one is a criminal. 
 - I am not a criminal! 
 - Of course I know that,  but you do kinda look like one,  'cause you're in a jail, and that's where criminals live. 
 - I was set up! 
 Varrick knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters  to pose as Northern soldiers to get Republic City  to join the war. 
 That's why he had me arrested. 
 - Ah, I see what you're doing. 
 You're going for the insanity defense. 
 Smart. 
 - No! 
 I'm trying to tell you that Varrick isn't what he seems. 
 Where's Asami? 
 She'll listen to me. 
 - I asked her to come,  but she said it was too hard for her. 
 You being in jail like this  reminds her of her dad. 
 Okay, gotta run, but I'll be back tomorrow. 
 And I am gonna get you the best attorney  fame and fortune can buy. 
 - Bolin, wait. 
 If my theory about Varrick is right,  something might go down tonight at your premiere. 
 Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled. 
 Yeah, okay, big brother. 
 I promise. 
 Whew! 
 That insanity defense is definitely gonna work. 
 - Should we wait another day? 
 Korra still might come with reinforcements. 
 - We can't wait any longer. 
 It's time we take back what is ours! 
 It's time to take back our city! 
 - Say "Nuktuk."  - There they are, folks,  the sweethearts of the big screen,  and Republic City's most famous couple,  Bolin and Ginger. 
 - Let me get a picture. 
 - Wow, that was fun. 
 And did you hear what Shiro said? 
 We're Republic City's most famous couple. 
 - Bolin, you're a doll,  but you're as dumb as the rocks you bend. 
 We are not a couple. 
 - That's not what Shiro said. 
 - Stop stuffing your mustaches with Varri-cakes  and get to your post! 
 - You got it, Boss. 
 - You two are the pinnacle of refinement. 
 - This star-studded event just keeps getting  star-studdier, folks. 
 President Raiko and the First Lady,  Buttercup Raiko, just arrived. 
 And they're being greeted by entrepreneur extraordinaire,  Varrick. 
 - There they are, my two most honored guests. 
 Mwah! 
 What do you think? 
 No expense has been spared. 
 I brought in the finest entertainers from Ba Sing Se  and the best food from around the world. 
 Heck, I even had this red carpet  imported from the Fire Nation. 
 They make the best red stuff over there. 
 Fact! 
 All right, picture time! 
 - Varrick, you didn't have to do all this for us. 
 - I wanted to. 
 Mr. 
 President, I took one look at your wife,  and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste. 
 And that's why I know you're gonna love this mover! 
 - Varrick, I know what you're doing,  and I doubt your propaganda is going to change my mind  about going to war with the Northern Water Tribe. 
 - Oh, I think you'll be surprised  how persuasive I can be. 
 Thank you all for coming to the finale  of "Nuktuk: Hero of the South."  You know, when I first started this project,  there were a lot of naysayers out there. 
 "You can't make pictures move," they said. 
 "You can't take some knucklehead Earthbender  and make him a star," they said. 
 "You can't teach a polar bear dog to speak," they said. 
 Well, they're wrong. 
 Thanks to the magic of the movers,  our furry friends have found their voices. 
 And you'll be shocked to hear what they have to say. 
 They speak of the injustice that's happening  in the Southern Water Tribe right now. 
 My hope is that their words and this epic mover  will inspire a real-life hero  to rise up and help. 
 Thank you again. 
 Enjoy the show. 
 - When last we left our hero,  he was captured by the evil Unalaq's  dastardly pet bird. 
 Amazingly, with the power of his whistling,  Nuktuk escaped... 
 - And decided to seek out counsel. 
 - Thank you, wise sage. 
 I will travel to Republic City and seek help. 
 - Have a seat. 
 I'm just working on a cure for the common cold. 
 No longer will my citizens suffer from the sniffles. 
 - Mr. 
 President, there's something more important  than the sniffles right now. 
 I need your help to stop the evil Unalaq. 
 - Did you say "help"? 
 If there is one thing I love doing,  it's helping people-  - The seal-lion seemed a bit far-fetched,  but the portrayal of this president  is right on the money. 
 - I think this is your best mover yet. 
 - I just wish Mako was here to see it. 
 - Mmm. 
 I like to eat the top off the Varri-cake first. 
 - I just try to shove the whole thing  in my mouth at once. 
 I love our job. 
 - Huh? 
 - Northern Water Tribe automatons! 
 Nooo! 
 - Bee bo bop, Nuktuk cannot stop Unalaq. 
 Must destroy Nuktuk. 
 - Ha ha! 
 Aah! 
 - Looks like you forgot that water and automatons  don't mix. 
 - Beep bop boo. 
 Oh, no, circuits not working. 
 We did it! 
 But wait. 
 Where's Juji? 
 - Nuk-no! 
 - You can't die, Juji. 
 Not on my watch. 
 It's okay, Nuktuk. 
 At least I got to be... 
 Your friend. 
 " Juji! 
 - Are you okay? 
 It seems like this mover is really getting to you. 
 You do know Juji's not really dead? 
 - Of course I know. 
 Juji's fine. 
 He comes back to life in the end  when the doomsday device shifts the polarity of the Earth. 
 Oops. 
 Spoiler. 
 Sorry. 
 - Then what's wrong? 
 - I guess I just miss my friends. 
 Everything is going so well for me,  but it feels empty without everyone around. 
 Korra's gone, Mako's in jail, you're doing... 
 business lady stuff. 
 Team Avatar's fallen apart. 
 - I know. 
 Things have changed so much since we first met. 
 Why don't you come back in  and finish watching the mover with me? 
 - You go ahead. 
 I need another minute. 
 That's weird. 
 Whoa--ahh! 
 Ugh! 
 - They're after the president! 
 - You're too late, Nuktuk. 
 Soon, my doomsday device will shoot this block of ice  into the earth's core, freezing the entire planet. 
 And I will be the ruler of Ice Earth! 
 - I don't think so. 
 I don't think so! 
 - Huh! 
 Ha! 
 - Mr. 
 President, get back! 
 I'm here to help. 
 Looks like there's nowhere to go. 
 - Secure the president and call for backup immediately! 
 - Nuktuk, look out! 
 - Bolin, look out! 
 - Hyah! 
 - This is unbelievable! 
 Bolin is bending two full stacks  of earth discs at once, which would normally be illegal. 
 But then again, he's fighting three Waterbenders,  so all rules are out the window. 
 - Tell me who sent you! 
 - It was Varrick. 
 Please don't hurt me, Nuktuk! 
 - I think this is our cue to exit. 
 - Where do you think you're going? 
 - It's a knockout! 
 - They're falling back. 
 - Varrick's plan was to kidnap you  and blame it on the North. 
 Then Republic City would have no choice  but to join the war on the side of the South. 
 - I can't believe Varrick would do something like this,  and no one saw it coming. 
 - Actually, someone did. 
 Remember Mako? 
 - You've got a great officer on your hands. 
 - He's one of the best. 
 - Mwah! 
 I can't believe my boyfriend is a real-life hero. 
 - Boyfriend? 
 Wait, stop. 
 I thought you said we weren't a couple. 
 - You really are as dumb as those rocks. 
 Of course we're a couple. 
 - Bolin, you saved the president. 
 And you proved Mako was right all along. 
 We have to go tell him what happened. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Oh, you meant right now. 
 - President Raiko... 
 - Avatar Korra, what's wrong? 
 - Sir, I know I've asked for your help before,  but things have changed. 
 Unalaq doesn't just want to take over the South anymore. 
 He wants to destroy the whole world. 
 - Unalaq is gonna destroy the world? 
 He really does have a doomsday device? 
 - He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit  during harmonic convergence,  which is only a few days away. 
 If he succeeds, the world as we know it is over. 
 Sir, we desperately need your help. 
 - I'm sorry, Korra, but my answer is still no. 
 - There are lives on the line! 
 And my daughter is one of them. 
 Raiko, you must reconsider. 
 
 
 
 - I'm aware that lives are on the line,  and that's precisely why my troops are staying here. 
 If the world is going to be thrown into chaos,  like you claim, I need to protect my citizens. 
 I'm sorry. 
 - Sir... 
 Nuktuk needs your help. 
 I know you love helping people. 
 - Son, I appreciate you saving my life,  and I'm a big fan of your work,  but my decision is final. 
 - I never should have saved that guy. 
 - If you guys need help, I'm here for you. 
 - Yeah, me too. 
 - Thank you. 
 It's so good to see you guys again. 
 Wait, where's Mako? 
 - So how was the big premiere? 
 - I saved the president! 
 In real life! 
 - Wait, what? 
 - You were right about Varrick. 
 He tried to kidnap Raiko! 
 - I knew it. 
 - But it didn't work, because of you. 
 And because of me. 
 Let's just say we both did good. 
 Beifong says you're free to go. 
 Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako. 
 - Don't worry about it, bro. 
 - Nice job, Mako. 
 You're going to make a great detective. 
 - But, Chief, there aren't any detective openings right now. 
 - Actually, we have two openings. 
 - Mwah. 
 Mako, I missed you so much. 
 - Oh, yeah, did I forget to tell you? 
 Korra's back. 
 - Korra, hey, I missed you too. 
 So you're not still mad at me? 
 - Why would I be mad? 
 - We had that fight before you left, remember? 
 - No, not really. 
 I got attacked by a dark spirit,  and I lost my memory for a little while. 
 Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. 
 Was it a bad fight? 
 - Uh... 
 mm...no. 
 No, it-- it wasn't that bad. 
 - Korra, we don't have much time. 
 We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq. 
 - I think I know just the man to talk to. 
 - Guys, hey! 
 What do you think? 
 Varrick Industries built this prison,  and I had this cell made special. 
 I had a feeling I'd end up here one day. 
 Zhu Li, come on! 
 We got guests. 
 Whip up a pot of that green tea I love. 
 - Yes, sir. 
 - Zhu Li's in prison with you? 
 - Of course. 
 I don't go anywhere  without my assistant. 
 Do you? 
 - We're not interested in your tea,  and this isn't a friendly visit. 
 - Don't tell me you guys are still mad  about everything that happened. 
 I did some good things too. 
 Korra, who warned you about Unalaq? 
 I did. 
 Bolin, who got you into the movers? 
 I did. 
 Asami, who saved your company? 
 I did. 
 Mako, who got you thrown in jail? 
 I did! 
 Oh, yeah, I guess that was a bad thing. 
 - You stole everything from me,  and you tried to kidnap the president. 
 Those are pretty bad too. 
 - I wasn't going to hurt him. 
 I just needed to start a war. 
 Well, a bigger war. 
 - Well, we're gonna end it. 
 Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami? 
 - The Future Industries stuff? 
 It's on my battleship. 
 - You have a battleship? 
 - Of course I do! 
 I bought the first one they made,  named her the Zhu Li. 
 - You named your battleship after your assistant? 
 - Yep. 
 They're both cold, heartless war machines. 
 - Your tea, sir. 
 - Look, I am truly sorry for the mess I caused. 
 Let me make it up to you. 
 Take Zhu Li. 
 My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it. 
 - It's not the fleet we were looking for,  but it's the next best thing. 
 - All right! 
 Team Avatar is back in business! 
 - It's okay. 
 We're going to stop Unalaq  and get Jinora back. 
 - I hope my dad's all right. 
 - I'm sure he's fine. 
 Get the men and fall back. 
 - What about you? 
 - I'm going to end this right now. 
 Go! 
 - Hello, Tonraq. 
 Looking for me? 
 - Brother, I'm too strong for you. 
 - You're no brother of mine. 
 You betrayed me. 
 You had me banished. 
 - Yes, I did. 
 - Stop! 
 He's mine. 
 - You are not the true chief. 
 - I am. 
 And you will bow to me. 
 - Now that I've defeated you,  your daughter is next.
