 He was born to know your name. 
 I know a lot of things about you. 
 I know how much it hurts, like your whole body, you're so screaming to be heard. 
 Nobody's there to listen. 
 That's how we were. 
 No more. 
 You see, when that snake comes to eat everything up, you know what'll save you?

 I just, um, I didn't know who else to call. 
 What is it? 
 My girl... My daughter, Emma, she... she's gone.

 You know his name, this fella? 
 Rick Zondervan. 
 Rick Zondervan. 
 How old is she again? 
 She's 16. 
 Look, Sam, we really appreciate this, but just, this, it... it can't be official. 
 With the election next year... 
 Obviously, yes, finding her is the important thing, But if you can keep it quiet, there are people who'd appreciate it. 
 [jingling] 
 Still married? 
 Technically... I guess. 
 I'm sorry, I didn't... 
 No, no, that's okay. 
 How's your boy?

 L.A. has always got to be first, first spic riots, first jig riots, Now the first diaper riots. 
 Six days after the first attacks on the Con Thien Marine Base located 3 kilometers south of the northern Vietnam demilitarized zone. 
 Over 100 tons of military supplies have been airlifted to the combat zone. 
 The guy you talked to, Steve Elmer, a record producer, owns a house, a little under two years. 
 Arrests? 
 None. 
 Anything else? Lieu needs me for body-pats. 
 Said we never had this many females. 
 Not true. Did a whorehouse sweep in '61, double the..., half the quality. 
 Uh-oh, isn't that what's-his-name?

 Quiet, both of you. 
 So, Brian, please tell me you made a buy. 
 Yeah. 
 Did you log it? 
 Oh, no... well, I woke up in the car after... 
 He was going for his gun. 
 I was going for my badge. 
 Oh, why won't you shut up, freak? 
 Don't touch me unless you love me, all right? 
 Hey. Hey! 
 Hey, Lieu, can I talk to you for a minute? 
 That Shafe kid... 
 You volunteering to give him the buzz cut? 
 No. 
 So wait. I report to you? 
 Yep. 
 Why? 
 Lieutenant says. 
 Because... 
 Missing girl's from a family with juice, Lieutenant thinks it's not a bad idea to be nice to a dad who's friends with the mayor, the governor, maybe even the next president. 
 Look, I didn't crack some secret hippie code to tell you what they're really saying, and I don't want to be the bait to get you in the room just so you can start bashing skulls. 
 If I want to crack skulls, I don't need you. 
 I can do that by myself. 
 What else do you guys know how to do? 
 "You guys." Really? 
 See something you don't understand, you want to hit it, or shoot it. 
 Oh, you're hurting my feelings. 
 You know me so well. 
 I know the first two words we say, you're leaning on me to do your thing. 
 Well, then you also know that hair's going high and tight tomorrow morning, that uniform is coming out of plastic, Lieutenant's orders, unless... 
 "Stop war now"... ah... 
 Rick Zondervan. 
 You didn't really think you were never gonna see me again, did you?

 Hey, you wanted to work with me, okay? 
 This is me. 
 So I've got to go out and find a pay phone? 
 Do you got one in the car? 
 Send the old guy out to find a pay phone. 
 Is that it? 
 I just bought you five minutes. 
 I want a lawyer. 
 No, you don't. 
 I want to call my dad. 
 You know this is personal for him, right?
