 Previously on "Aquarius"... 
 She's had electroshock therapy. 
 She's not quite herself. 
 The recovery can take some time. 
 I'm taking you home. 
 You like that home cooking? 
 Go ahead and lay down, Ralph. 
 All your boys are waiting for you up there in the green pastures of the Lord. 
 So you're saying you're just gonna get me clean, and I'm just gonna relap? 
 This isn't something you ever leave behind. 
 Relapse happens more often than not. 
 Hal's been letting us crash here. 
 I can work on my music without having to scramble for food and shelter. 
 I need you to take a drop from a CI 
 with the black separatists. 
 Wanda? I'm Perry's friend. 
 Did Dennis do that to my song? 
 Change it back now. 
 Talk to Dennis. 
 The evidence was planted. 
 We got history, Hodiak. I'm calling it in. 
 [gunshots] 
 There's only one thing left to do. 
 Now, you and Sadie know what I'm asking you for, don't you, Tex? 
 Tie 'em up. 
 Yes. 
 Use knives. 
 Yes. 
 Paint the walls with blood. 
 [dark music] 
 Yes. 
 Yes. Have him call me back. 
 Hold on. I have a new business number. 
 It's 213-450... 
 Yes, that's right. 
 No, that's no longer my home number. 
 Thank you. 
 Can I read here while you work? 
 I-I don't want to be alone. 
 Of course, sweetie. 
 Ah, rereading your favorite. 
 You loved Jo. Wanted to put on plays like she did and be a writer. 
 I don't remember any of it. 
 It'll come back. 
 I spoke to a doctor who assured me the memory loss is temporary. 
 Meanwhile, you get to enjoy your favorites like they're brand new. 
 Daddy, what happened to Charlie? 
 I don't know. I found you at the hospital. 
 I remember being with Charlie, and then I left. 
 Does anybody need a reason to run away from a creep? 
 I'm damn glad you did. 
 You don't want to tell me. 
 Daddy, what did I do? 
 Nothing. 
 Absolutely nothing. 
 You were a high-spirited girl with a mother who wanted to squash you. 
 I... I blamed you for your rebellion, but that was just... 
 I was scared. 
 I thought you hated me. 
 I was so... miserable, Emma. 
 I lied to myself that you were ready to be on your own, but... you were still a little girl. 
 Forgive me. 
 I love you, Emma. 
 I just didn't know... or... or trust. 
 Forgive me. 
 I love you, Daddy, and it's okay, you know. 
 It's really okay. 
 I don't care that you're homosexual. 
 Like Jo, you have to be true to yourself. 
 That's all that Charlie wants for himself, for me, and you. 
 You have to go to... the now, to the real. 
 I was... I was trying to help Charlie. 
 I wasn't running away. 
 I wanted to save him.

 [police radio chatter] They had to be from United Africa. Had to be? What? Were they wearing signs? I can describe them. If you just bust everybody at U-A, I'll spot them. Maybe I'll just set her up with a sketch artist. I don't want to draw no damn pictures! I want you to go to U-A headquarters! What happened? They came blasting in, and Bunchy tried to get away, and I-I couldn't get there. They just kept shooting. [crying] It's okay. Sit down. Why are you sitting there? They're getting away! Look, ma'am, right now, my job is just to find out what you know. Hey, is this your case? Yeah. I got the call. I want it. This is Westwood, not Hollywood... It's Wilshire's case. I'll clear it with Garrick. He'll approve it. Ain't gonna be an easy case to close. Shooter or shooters got away clean, like a gang killing. You can't trust the witnesses, not even pretty boy's African queen. Lucky for you. Less of a headache, then. Hey. Come on. Don't you want to question the other witnesses? Send me your report. Yeah. You'll get it, Hodiak, in triplicate. You're gonna send them in triplicate? That'll show me. [upbeat funk music] ♪ All I need is your love ♪

That means he's here, chica. Esta aqui. Go anywhere you like. Go and see. He not here. Dennis, man, let's talk! Let's... let's talk about singin'.

She's a witness. You're her husband. I don't question witnesses in front of their hubbies. I'll keep my mouth shut. Well, then she's gonna have to come back to the precinct. It's already a big break that she was allowed to come back home. Move along. There's nothing to see. Sam, I'm not going. Then I'm gonna bring her to interrogation. Look, aren't you busy, anyway? Isn't this a follow-up session day? Bernadette's staying at Mama's today, and I don't want her seeing me like this. Well... Honey, I'll be back in, like, two hours. You're going? Yeah. You know, clinic night. [door opens, closes] You want coffee? Sure. What makes you so sure it was U-A? Well, it's just like I told that dumb-ass detective. The FBI's been using U-A to get at Bunchy. They have been tapping the Panthers' phones, sending in spies, sending hate mail. You know that. And you know they even planted drugs. That was our very own Red Squad. Well, it's the same difference. The FBI are working through the LAPD, and don't deny it. And Bri's been making excuses, but you're smarter than that. Just arrest everybody at U-A, and I will pick them out. This ain't Russia. I can't just round up 100 people on suspicion. So you're not gonna do nothing, just like Bunchy said. The... when it comes down to it, a cop is loyal to cops... Kris... Not the law. I admired Bunchy as much as you did. He was arrogant. He acted like he was a law unto himself, and he was brave as a god, and he hated cops. And we hated him. So I understand that you don't believe that we're gonna do right by him, but this is me. You know me. I am arrogant, and I am a law unto myself. You give me a description, and I will get them. FBI or no, I will get them. How do you think Bunchy's death will affect your marriage? I guess we'll be rough for a while, and Kristin's real upset. No, what I mean, Brian, and this is to your credit... When we talked about what it was that triggered you to go back to using, you talked about Kristin working with the Panthers. In one session, you said, "I need to know she's got my back, like we're riding together, riding life together." Yeah, for sure. I rely on her. So, since it bothered you that she was working with the Panthers, how do you feel about Bunchy being dead? Are you suggesting that I'm not sorry he's dead? Are you not sorry? No, it's bad. It's bad for the black community. He was a leader. But? Yeah. Okay. I hope it'll mean Kristin will be home more. I need her. Bernadette needs her. They say it's an ill wind that blows nobody any good. So maybe that's not bad for my marriage. You're kidding me. Kidding? [laughs] Man, I do love to kid. What do you want me to kid you about, huh? Your cheesy suit? Where'd you get it? Did you make a deal with Monty Hall? Vick. Huh? You don't recognize me? Shafe? My man, what happened? You inside of there? Hi, Vick. Hi. So, I guess this means you're using again? Me? No. I'm just... I'm here to pick up chicks. These addicts are, like, easy pickings. [chuckles] Oh, man, you're blowing my mind. Are you hooked? For real? That's heavy, man. Heavyosity. I don't... The worm... He's slow to move, but he loves to turn. [women laughing] Oh. [siren wailing] Meg? Wilshire's... Here's a preliminary witness description. They'll have a sketch this afternoon, and I'm sure Cutler wants to see you. Sam, get in here. I'd ask you why you stole the Bunchy Carter murder from Wilshire, but I know the answer. You love trouble. And I'd tell you to give the hot potato back, but I don't have to. All right. I'll talk to Garrick. He'll let me keep it. Yeah, no, he won't. This comes from Garrick's office. The FBI's taking over the case. Why? What makes this a federal case? They use out-of-state bullets? Attempted kidnapping. Kidnapping by murder? And the killers are suspected to be foreign agents. From what country? Oakland? It's the FBI. They can make up any crap they want. This is a break for you. This is a case that'll never close. Okay, fine. It's the FBI's headache. No, no, Sam, don't. I don't know what wrench you're about to throw in my ass, but I beg you, don't. I love it when you beg. [classic rock music] No, no, I can't breathe. Oh, no, I can't breathe! Hi. Hi. Who are you? Who are you? I'm Bobby Beausoleil. I can't breathe! What are you doing to Hal? It's not working. It's not working. It's not working. Hal, man, Hal... No. Hey, breathe, breathe. Hi, hi. Who are you? No. Bobby. It's Bobby. Oh, Bobby gets the best girls. Girls... yeah, I do, Hal. Hal's far out, for a quad. No! Bobby, it's stuck. Air's stuck. Hey, massage his forehead. Ugh! I can't... [gasping for air] Acid's freaking him out. Acid? Are you crazy? You can't give a quad acid. Air... He needs mescaline. The guy I'm crashing with... He makes mesc. Okay. Yeah, that'll clear your jets. All right, Hal? I'll give him a call. But I need this chick's help to score. Can I have her? Okay. Go, do what he says. Bye, Bobby. What the hell's the rush? I was on my way to dinner. Sorry, but the information I have for you is urgent, and I need to be at a consciousness-raising group in half an hour. Anyway, I needed to see you pronto, because Wanda says that U-A is gonna take down the Panthers while they're weak and leaderless. She wasn't positive when, but she thinks it will be tonight or tomorrow. Good. What are you gonna do? I'm going to have a steak and catch the Lakers game. So you're just gonna let U-A hit them? This is what we wanted to happen. Do not make me regret this. I'm only telling you because no one else will care that if we don't do something, innocent people will die. I love you too. United Africa is attacking Panthers HQ tonight or tomorrow. How do you know? I thought you love me. If you love me, then trust me, and do what I say. Well, with that kind of attitude, you're never gonna get married. Even if I told you everything that I know, nothing will help you more than knowing U-A will massacre the Panthers, okay?

 [baby cooing] I'll put her to bed. What are you doing here, Sam? It's been a long day. I'm here on police business. Well, come back tomorrow. You know, Kristin was arrested on a sweep of Panther headquarters. I know You know? The FBI has taken over Bunchy's case. It's local. I told you the FBI was behind this. Hoover's out to destroy the Panthers, and he... Listen, if we can coordinate this... If I can haul in the probable shooters, and you can identify them before the FBI shuts us down, then we got a case. But you got to be honest with yourself. Can you positively identify the shooters? I told you I can. That's good enough for me. I'll let you know when to bring her by the precinct. All right? Can I borrow this? Yeah. Um... "It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at oneself through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness... An American, a negro. Two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings, two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder." Is that... is that how you feel? Uh-huh. Is that how Bunchy felt? Yeah. Doesn't everybody feel that way sometimes? Well, sometimes ain't all the time. [door opens] So, what was is those Red squad letters you passed to U-A? I didn't open them. Not even one little peek? No, not one. So, how did you get them to arrest all those Panthers? Arresting Panthers in L.A. is like shooting fish in a barrel. I called in an anonymous tip that they were torturing a CI, and Newton had two vans there within 15 minutes. God bless America. So that's a temporary fix. They'll be out on bail tomorrow. 75 Panthers? That's a lot of bail. No, I think we got a couple days. You tell me who killed Bunchy, and I think we'll be in good shape.
