 Turn around... slow... big man. 
 And drop me that piece while you're at it. 
 [chuckles] 
 Well... I guess I'll get that later. 
 Listen, whatever it is you want, whatever your situation, we can solve this, you and me. 
 Solve it. Yeah. 
 Is this a riddle? 
 What's your name, man? 
 Me? 
 Oh, I'm Jesus Christ. 
 Son of Man. 
 Listen, this is a mistake. You don't know who I am. 
 Well, I know who you're not... and I'm disappointed, but I'm working with the situation at hand, friend. 
 Now strip. 
 Shirt, pants... off. 
 Wait a minute, you... 
 Keep the volume down while you do it. 
 We don't wanna disturb your creamy little piece of cake in there, now do we? 
 Now, turn around. On your knees. 
 I'm a cop. 
 Are you now? 
 Think about this. 
 What you do... is gonna be done to you ten times over. 
 Down, big dog. 
 Down. 
 [grunting] 
 Moran : So, okay... about done. 
 Sorry, Cut, this is, uh... 
 Never taken a statement like this from, you know, one of us. 
 It's a little, uh... 
 It's not your fault the call came in. 
 You're just following protocol. 
 Let's just get it over with, all right? 
 Okay, uh... brown hair, brown eyes, shortish, greasy hair, moccasins? 
 I know, it's half the so-called men in L.A. 
 I'm telling you, it's just some drugged-up hippie freak. 
 So Hodiak know? 
 Come on, Moran. Yeah. 
 Jeanie know? 
 Okay. Okay. 
 So anything to add? 
 Yeah. Keep it under your hat. 
 You're gonna love Mother Mary. 
 So who is she, just one of us? 
 No. The first of us. 
 When Charlie got out of prison, he heard it was all love in San Francisco, and pow... instant thunderstorm. 
 They were meant to meet. She took care of him. 
 And then when he found me and the others, she took care of all of us. 
 So why isn't she with us? 
 She has a real job. But... now it's time to come home. 
 [engine turns] 
 Jimbo, you lost weight. 
 Small ask? 
 Any chance it'll wipe out what I owe you from poker? 
 366 bucks? 
 It might, actually. 
 I'm all yours, Detective. 
 FBI liaison... how's that going? 
 Oh, they're a shiny parade of ass-clench. 
 Who are deep in the antiwar demonstrators. 
 What they got you on, follow and photo? 
 Yeah. They're not much for the actual work. 
 Right. Well, I need you to get me whatever you got before you funnel it to them, all right? 
 On this guy named Robbie Arthur? 
 You know this guy? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 A squirrelly little munchbag. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I wanna know where he goes, who he talks to, pretty much 24-7 if you can. 
 Anything I should be on the lookout for? 
 [sighs] 
 Him. 
 Isn't this... 
 No questions, Jimbo.

 No. Cutler's there.

 Hey, hey, you gonna ask for an autograph too?

 You got here fast as me when the call came in. 
 Or do you just like the girls with the spangly pants? 
 Ah, the business of show. 
 Every one of these guys crucial? 
 Cutler : Come on. Guy was a star. 
 I'm not sure that rubs off once you're dead. 
 Hmm... 
 Religious? 
 Cutler : Well, funny you should ask. 
 [whistles] 
 Someone was religious. 
 I... I... I don't... I don't understand. 
 He... he's in there? Raymond? 
 I need to ask you a few questions to help with our investigation. 
 Uh... you were the girlfriend of... 
 Fiancée. 
 I, uh, I just got off the phone with Mr. Novo's manager. He's on his way over. 
 Says he also happens to manage you. 
 Yes. 
 How old are you, Miss Jens? 
 I'm 23. 
 And Raymond was... 
 I... I don't know. 
 46, according to his studio bio, and 51 according to his driver's license. 
 His real name is... was... Esteban Novarro. 
 Mexican. 
 [sniffles] Yes. 
 Can you think of anybody that might want to harm him? 
 No. 
 No, never. 
 What about the suite? 
 He spend a lot of time here? 
 Whenever he was shooting here. 
 So you must be pretty familiar with it. 
 Uh, no, no. Raymond was a gentleman. 
 Oh, no, no, I don't mean that. 
 I just need to determine if anything was taken, stolen. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, um... 
 He, uh, he kept... he kept watches and things here. 
 He had... he had his gold watch and his ring. 
 The ring is gone. 
 What kind of ring? 
 Um, it was a... a ruby ring. 
 He got it when he went to Rome with his mom. 
 He treasured it. 
 This ring? 
 Yeah.

 Can we come in? 
 Uh... yeah. S... sure, come on in. 
 Sadie : Look at you. Pantyhose! 
 If only the squares really knew. 
 Charlie asked you to come? 
 It's been months. 
 Mary, we miss you. 
 Does he know? 
 Is it his? Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh... he'll just be surprised is all. 
 Sadie : He keeps saying that he's missing you, and now we know why. 
 He must have sensed it. 
 He said he missed me. 
 Sadie : Of course.

 Right. Okay. 
 You're pretty. 
 Charlie's girls just keep getting prettier. 
 [door thuds closed] 
 I'm sorry, Father, I know they're not pleasant. 
 What I'm wondering is do you think this is kind of a specific message? 
 Well... he's crucified. 
 I... I hate to say it, but I see... things as bad as this all the time. 
 I'm trying to determine if this is a deeply, explicitly Catholic thing, you think? 
 Or maybe just a violence thing that happens to look really Catholic. 
 If you're asking me does it say to me... 
 "Sunday school crazy"? 
 Yeah... [chuckles] 
 Well, it's not a very good crucifixion, as they go. 
 There's more to it than nails. 
 Right. Crown of thorns. 
 Spear in the side. 
 What about the spilled wine here? 
 Could that mean something? 
 I suppose it could... Blood of the Christ. 
 But, to be fair, it looks like there's been a brawl. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 I wish I could be more help. 
 No, Father, eliminating theories is helpful. 
 Thank you for coming in. 
 Anytime. 
 It's good to see you. 
 Nice to see you. 
 I wish you'd come to church. 
 You called, my first thought was, you're coming back. 
 Ah... 
 I know... Your life. 
 I worry about you. 
 I'm okay, Father. 
 I've always worried about the path you've taken... to try and make sense of it all. 
 Well, it's... similar in a way to the path you took, Father. 
 I worry about you. 
 [chuckles] I knew your heart as a boy, Samson. 
 It was maybe a little too brave, a little too... caring. 
 Tough combination. 
 Hearts don't change. 
 Guard yours. 
 It's a good one. 
 Thank you, Father. 
 You might wanna work on that face, Charmain. 
 Sorry. What? 
 Poker face. You look disgusted. 
 Well, it's an arm with a nail through it. 
 And you're a policewoman, right? 
 Right. Thank you. 
 What are you doing right now, aside from hovering? 
 Cutler has me filing. 
 Care to dip a toe in this? 
 Yes. 
 So I'm beginning to think that it looks this way because someone was really very angry with Raymond Novo. 
 You mean stage a crucifixion? 
 Because it looks like a crucifixion. 
 Suffice it to say that he must have offended someone a tad. 
 And you want me to... 
 Uh, double-check cold case files. 
 See if I've forgotten any religious fetishistic-type murders in the past two years, as if that's possible. 
 Look into this. 
 It's a common nail. 
 Oh, you're good. 
 I didn't say it was gonna be easy. 
 It's an avenue. Could lead to premeditation. 
 We're walking it. "We" meaning you. 
 I know it's not as much fun as dressing up for Halloween... 
 Oh, no, I want to. 
 All right. 
 I'll, uh, I'll work on it right away. 
 Whatever "it" is better not get in the way of filing that right away. 
 It won't. 
 Quit getting her hopes up, Sam. 
 It's cruel, I mean... 
 [stammers] 
 You're not the next him, sweetheart, so I'd lose the puppy look. 
 It's heartbreaking to those of us who understand real life. for updates, so, um... 
 I got a lot of seeds planted... the Mafia, Straight Satans... 
 I'm watching the Peach Pussycat, and I'm in with some pretty suspicious freaks at this hippie house. 
 And we can close in on which of those? 
 None... yet. 
 But it's all connected. 
 You weave a tangled web. 
 It's heroin, man. 
 Yeah, that you're not within a mile of, man. 
 Look... 
 Supposed to be me? 
 Oh, no. This... is Mr. Druggie. 
 Mr. Druggie wants to import wholesale, sell retail, and live in a big house next to Hugh Heffner. 
 Now, you see this leg? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 That is Gladner. 
 Oh. 
 Gladner... well, he's dead, right? 
 Bye, leg. 
 I'm gonna take out Marvin. 
 Lucille... Vickery, and Roy. 
 Gee, who told you I like it when there's pictures? 
 But take away all those cats, and Mr. Druggie's still going strong. 
 Until... 
 Guapo. 
 That's what I'm working at, Well, thanks for that. 
 I feel... I understand crime a lot better now. 
 Yeah, well, then stop acting like you don't. 
 No, I'm acting like a guy who's seen a case or two.

 ♪ Someone like me ♪ 
 Well, here's what I don't get, Bert. 
 So you're at the guard gate at 10:00 p.m. 
 Novo drives back onto the lot. 
 Yeah, he was sometimes here at night. 
 Shooting? 
 Yeah, see, because the office got in touch with me, the production office it's called, and they gave me this schedule. 
 The call sheet. 
 No, this is more like a plan for shooting scenes. 
 It's a call sheet. 
 No, that would be a record of phone calls. 
 It's what time you're called to work... actors and crew. Call sheet. 
 That's confusing. Anyway, according to the call sheet here, Novo, on the day he was killed, was "called" at, uh, 6:00 a.m. and then he was "wrapped" at 6:00... no, he was wrapped at 4:15 p.m. 
 Which means when he drove back on the lot at 10:00 p.m., it wasn't to work. 
 No. 
 You saw someone with him, didn't you? 
 Right? You did, Bert. 
 So when Novo drove back on the lot, you probably didn't look too closely, didn't get a great look at the girl... the girls, maybe? 
 There were no girls. 
 No offense, Bert, but someone killed Novo, and I doubt it was you. 
 Unless this is a confession. 
 No, li... 
 Listen to me. 
 There were no... girls. 
 You have to promise me you won't say anything in the press. 
 It'll ruin his memory. 
 I'll do what I can. 
 You have to understand that I really loved him. 
 Okay. But you weren't really his fiancee, were you? 
 He was my best friend. 
 And the studio paid me to be his girl. 
 I warned him it was dangerous. 
 He would pick up these men, and he would bring them here, you know, to impress them, and... and for privacy. 
 Open secret with the studio. 
 Everyone was paid to be discreet... including the men. 
 Where would he find these men? 
 You know? 
 No, no, you tell them come back here, give me a full report, then we talk about opening your case. 
 Oh, no, thank you. 
 Charmain... where the hell... get in...

 We're not in high school anymore. 
 I wish to hell I was. 
 Come on. Let's give it a rest. 
 Hey, Paul Lynde. 
 Thanks for your help. 
 What help? 
 You had to know when I walked in that bar was gonna get shut down. 
 Well, I thought we might be faster than the Hollywood machine. 
 Long shot. 
 You're somewhat exercised for a guy who thought he'd catch a limp wrist just by drinking their beer. 
 I like catching killers. 
 Don't need to think too much on the details. 
 Mighty big of you. 
 Why the hell are you so Up With People on a bunch of homos anyway? 
 No, really, I... I get it. 
 Some otherwise nice-seeming guys, sad to see them wreck their lives like that, but it's still deviant, huh? 
 Still... wrong. 
 Well, I thought you were of the "free your mind, roll your own" generation. 
 Don't act dumb, all right? 
 There is a line, and they stick their necks out crossing it. 
 And they know it. You know what it is? 
 They're... they're addicted. 
 Yeah, like all the junkies I see. 
 And they know something can go wrong, and they do it anyway. 
 They're just sick. 
 It's sad. 
 And for what, huh? How the hell is it worth the risk to do that? 
 You know what I realized trying to understand people? 
 What? 
 Don't try to understand 'em. 
 I know what I'd kill for and what I'd die for. 
 You served. You do too. 
 And every day on this job, we get to see what other people would kill and die for and I used to think it was different, but it's not. 
 It's the same. Love, hate. 
 With a side of stupid. 
 You seem... 
 Old? 
 You okay? 
 Well... 
 [sighs] Go home and kiss your wife. 
 You can count on that.

 Mother Mary. 
 Look at that blessing. 
 You see it in her eyes. 
 The wounded little bird. 
 Charlie : Mother... lover...

 Let me back into your heart. 
 Charlie, I... 
 I know, I know, I... 
 I hurt you. 
 You didn't hurt me, Charlie. 
 You... hurt me. 
 I... saw stars. 
 I couldn't... chew for a week. 
 I won't apologize for passion. 
 I love you. 
 I love you so much. 
 Mary... 
 Mary, you are the light, and I am the lighthouse keeper. 
 [beads clattering] Mary? 
 Oh, my God! 
 Is it yours? 
 I don't know. 
 Is it mine, Cherry pie? 
 It's ours. 
 Yes. 
 And we'll raise it together. 
 We are a revolution. 
 And one day... the world will know our name. 
 Katie : Yes.
