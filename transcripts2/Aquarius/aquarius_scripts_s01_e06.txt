 [knock at door] 
 Shafe : Hodiak? 
 You got any Tylenol for your... 
 Cupboard. 
 Manson, you were gonna kill him. 
 What do you want from me? 
 I want you to have a story, whether it's the truth, or... 
 He say anything to you, Manson? 
 He thanked me. 
 That must have felt nice. 
 He owes me now. 
 And I can use him to get in with Butano. 
 Skip the pushers, get to the supplier... my job, yeah? 
 And I can use him to get to Emma. 
 For you. You still want that, right? 
 I need to sleep. 
 So do you. 
 [eerie music] 
 Hi. 
 Uh, hi. Uh, can I help you? 
 Hey? Hey, hey, hey, hey? 
 What do you think you're doing? What do you think... 
 Shh. 
 ♪ Makin' love, making love ♪ 
♪ Makin' love ♪ 
♪ Oh, yeah ♪ 
 Oh, Katie. Lucky girl. 
 Sure am. Right? 
 Thank God. We ran out last week. 
 Where's my bandages? Huh? 
 I'm... I'm beat all to hell here, my head's about to split open, and you bring me these little things of messed up pads! 
 It's for your bleeding. We... we got you pills. 
 We got you lots of pills. 
 Doctors in the reformatory used to bring me pills just like these. 
 To make me mellow. 
 Is that what you want? Mellow yellow Charlie? 
 Pills will make you feel better, Charlie. 
 What'll make me feel better is bandages. 
 Get out! 
 You don't want to leave, so what's the plan? 
 For if that pig comes sniffing again? 
 He was looking for Cherry. Cherry ain't here. 
 When we were in the city, I told him to split. 
 Sadie being Sadie, they're working a Tijuana donkey show by now. 
 Come on. 
 Yummy. 
 What do you know about this cat, Brian? 
 We need to decide a strategy. What to tell people. 
 Emma can't be visiting her grandmother again forever. 
 Sam will find her. 
 And bring her home, that's our strategy. 
 Maybe he shouldn't. 
 What? 
 Ken : We already found her. What good did it do? 
 Ken, she's 16. 
 Drag her back home, watch her day and night, she'll... find another window to climb out of. 
 What does Manson want with you? 
 He doesn't... 
 You can't tell me this is some random coincidence... he was your client. 
 For a possession charge... dope. Don't be so hysterical. 
 I know what he is. 
 I know what he is, Ken, and I know the kinds of people that you represent. 
 How does someone like Manson even afford you? 
 Funny, you never asked where the money came from while you were spending it. 
 Grace : Oh, don't you dare make this about me. 
 I knew the kind of man you were when I married you. 
 Oh, jeez, here we go. 
 The half truths... I thought... you know what, I thought that I could live with it. 
 'Cause I'm the only one, right, I'm the only liar in this house, right? 
 Right? 
 Stop... you know what, just stop it, please. 
 I knew what you were too when I married you, what you still are. 
 And tell me what is going on. 
 I told you. I told you. 
 Do you want me to go to my father with this? 
 I told you. I told you. 
 You want him to ask you? 
 I told you. 
 I told you. 
 You want him looking into your life, Ken? 
 Because he will. I will go to him right now. 
 You will not. 
 I will go to him... tell me. 
 Tell me. 
 Manson... knows things. 
 About Hal, the RNC. About me. 
 What things? 
 Ken : If he talks to the wrong people, we could lose the firm, the house, everything. 
 That's all you need to know. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 Morning. 
 You got in late. 
 What's this? 
 Somebody called to talk to your guy at the bar. 
 Who's Jimmy Butano and why does he need to see Charlie so bad? 
 I got to go. I'm sorry, babe, I got to go. 
 Well you... you're off today. 
 Jimmy's not used to people saying no to him, that's who Jimmy is. 
 You're off today, Bri. My mom's coming. 
 Your ma? 
 Yes. 
 Since when? 
 Since she called and invited herself. 
 Well she's your mom, you can't... you can't be alone with her? 
 Just beautiful, aren't you? 
 I know, I think she's got my eyes. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 But that high yellow, that came from her daddy. 
 I ought to put her down for a nap. 
 Okay. Hi, sweetie. 
 [glass shattering] 
 You okay? You okay? 
 Yes. 
 I rent a few other properties in this area, no problems. 
 Yeah, you rent to people like my wife? 
 I'm sorry. If you want out of your lease... 
 No, of course not. 
 Repairs will be done today. 
 Any idea who did it? 
 Shafe : I got a few theories. 
 Sorry. The door was open. 
 Are you okay? 
 Oh, my God. What happened? 
 I went back to Manson's. Emma wasn't there. 
 And I'm not giving up. 
 You never do. 
 I wish that were true. 
 You got drunk, didn't you? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 Kind of. 
 I can't believe sometimes... this is where we ended up. 
 I know. 
 This is who we are. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, last night, as... as I was passing out, I... I started thinking about that dance at your club. 
 What was it... it was, uh, '47? 
 Hmm! God, that summer. 
 What was that song that was on the radio constantly? 
 Yeah, I remember. 
 Oh... Time after Time. 
 Time after Time. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 God, that song was everywhere. 
 You know, if I could wake up any place and just... stay there forever... that's where I'd go. 
 Me too. 
 I, um, I want you to look into Ken. 
 Look into him how? What do you mean? 
 I need to leave him, but I think that he might have done something illegal. 
 Well, he is a lawyer. 
 No. Something big. 
 With his partner, Hal Banyin, and Manson. 
 Grace, there's something I didn't tell you. 
 Before Manson was in prison, he was a pimp. 
 One of his girls disappeared and shortly after that, your husband took him on as a client and he was never charged with the disappearance, or for running the girls. 
 Wait, you knew this before? 
 Yeah. 
 And you didn't tell me? 
 Grace, just... 
 Why would you lie to me about who Emma is with? 
 How... how would that have made a difference? 
 Oh, my God. 
 I don't see how that would have helped her. 
 You and Ken, you both just... 
 Me and Ken? 
 Both just... you lie. 
 Me and Ken? That's bu... 
 My child is gone. 
 Do you have any idea what that feels like? 
 Are you... are you kidding me? 
 Do you hear what you're saying? My son is missing, my son! 
 [loud crash] 
 Grace. 
 [door slams] 
 Hey, did you bring enough pie for the whole class? 
 Jeanie made it for Captain Dunne. 
 Just being friendly. 
 Loo's not dead, you know? 
 Bringing a pie doesn't buy you his job. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I slept funny. 
 You drinking again? 
 What do you care, man? 
 I care a lot. 
 These mopes are all goody gals and lightweights. 
 Nah. 
 Semper fi. 
 Huckleberry. 
 As I recall, my wife's specialty. 
 No, this was '59. The girl was never found. 
 No, I don't... I don't have a name... she was a hooker. 
 Yeah, any and all files that match. 
 No, I... I don't... I don't care how many, just all of them. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, Hodiak? 
 Yeah? 
 S.C. football... you a fan? 
 Sure. 
 Lori Price, head cheerleader. 
 Hmm, which one is she? 
 You know, blonde, beautiful. 
 Oh, her. 
 You tell me you banged her, I'm gonna beat the living daylights... 
 No, no. But a beating is part of it. 
 Go on. 
 Why me? 
 Shafe says you were a big help finding Emma. 
 And? 
 And you did good, so... 
 What else? 
 Charmain, do you want to work the case or not? 
 Well, what would I do, exactly? 
 Ask her questions, get a statement. 
 By myself? 
 If it was you beaten and lying in an alley, would you want one of these knuckleheads asking you the questions? 
 Can I talk to you? 
 Uh, you're gonna do good. You... you... you'll be good. 
 Now Kristin wants to move, says the neighborhood's not safe, and I'm not gonna hear the end of it unless I can prove her wrong. 
 Well, you haven't been married long if you think proving her wrong is gonna help. 
 And I got to meet Butano like two hours ago, he wants to go back to the Spiral. 
 Do you think your neighbor Howard is the doer? 
 Do you have any... what do you call that again? 
 Evidence? 
 Yeah. 
 I have a rock. 
 Okay. 
 I'll check it out but you know, Kristin may not be wrong. 
 You live where you live, you got to worry about everyone else. 
 You live somewhere else, you only have to worry about yourself. 
 Understand? 
 You do, all right. 
 Got it. 
 Now I'm doing you a favor, you think maybe you can do me one? 
 Like? 
 I know he doesn't want to talk to me, but I need you to get a message to him. 
 Walt. 
 Saying what? 
 Before he does anything, I want to pay for a lawyer. 
 What's he gonna do? 
 Can you get a message to him? You can, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 How's it look? 
 It'll be gone in a week or two. 
 There's a game Sunday. 
 You're a cheerleader? 
 One of the patrol officers recognized you. 
 I was, USC. 
 But my boyfriend, he got drafted by the Rams. 
 There'll be pictures at the game. 
 You're a detective? 
 I'm helping the detectives. 
 Tell me about last night. 
 I was leaving a party, a man... a stranger pulled me into the alley outside the bar, choked me, and when I fought back, did this. 
 Were you with anyone else, any other cheerleaders, players? 
 My boyfriend, but we left separately. 
 That bruise on your neck. 
 I told you... he choked me. 
 From the color, it looks a few days old. 
 Morning. 
 At least, it was morning. 
 Late riser. 
 You never get anything done that way. 
 That's what my daddy always said. 
 I appreciate the enthusiasm, but what's the rush? 
 The state Charlie's in... he's not going anywhere. 
 I didn't get what I came for last night. 
 And I got a present for Charlie. 
 Hey, Howard? 
 What do you want? 
 This belong to you? 
 Look, I know Shafe's a cop. 
 What kind of idiot throws a rock through a cop's window? 
 I don't know, Howard, what kind of idiot are you? 
 Jesus, what is wrong with you? 
 Careful there, you wouldn't want to dent it. 
 New paint job, fresh wax. 
 Hey... hey, hey, are you out of your... what is wrong with you? 
 Whoops. 
 I'm sorry. 
 This is exactly what we were worried about. 
 When people like them move in, it only causes problems. 
 Who's we? 
 Oh, you think it's just me? 
 The value of every house on this block dropped the day they unpacked. 
 You know... I don't hate colored people. 
 I didn't say you did. 
 All right, what would you do? 
 More and more of them moving in every day, marching up the street three and four at a time, and they all have babies. 
 Manson : Well, well. 
 If it ain't my savior in the flesh. 
 And Little Jimmy. 
 Oh, I was fenced-in for a long time with your daddy. 
 You don't look like him. 
 I'm not like him. 
 Uh, yeah, you... you two zipped off so fast last night, we didn't even get a chance to pow wow. 
 What'd you do to piss off that cop, Hodiak? 
 Hodiak? 
 He was looking for some tumbleweed that already tumbled on. 
 You know, Roy, he was asking... how'd you get him to stop? 
 Surprised him, I guess. 
 Pigs like that, they're all candy ass deep down if they don't got you outnumbered, outgunned. 
 I didn't see coward. I saw animal. 
 Detective Hodiak, huh? 
 Speaking of being outgunned, I brought you something. 
 Hey, what are you... kidding me? 
 You son of a bitch! Are you kidding me, huh? 
 You kidding me, huh? Get off, get off. 
 Easy. All right, cowboy. 
 Hey, give me that. 
 Who's this prick? 
 Roy? Roy's a brother. 
 And you... you're my brother too, my man, you dig? 
 We can all be family. 
 I just thought you should, uh, be prepared next time, you know? 
 Never lose for lack of ammo. 
 All right. 
 You know, the girls are real grateful you two turned up when you did. 
 And this? This is a hell of a thing, Jim. 
 All the girls want to thank you. 
 If that's the case. 
 You too, Bri. 
 Katie was just saying before you came. 
 What about her? She want to thank me? 
 What do we say? 
 How old are you? 
 You don't want to do this. 
 It's not, you know, a turn on. 
 Charlie will be mad at me if... if I don't do a good job. 
 I'll tell him you were great. 
 And you can tell him I was quick. 
 Heh. 
 Okay. 
 Have you seen Hodiak? 
 No, what do you got? 
 Hey, till Priore rises from the near-dead, I'm acting L.T., so what do you got? 
 I spoke to the girl found off Sunset, the cheerleader. 
 Some days I really envy you, Charmain. 
 Her story doesn't add up. 
 She has old bruises, like it wasn't the first time. 
 It wasn't a robbery, it wasn't a rape, and her description matches half the males in L.A. 
 Well, nothing we can do about that. 
 I think she's covering. 
 For who? 
 Her boyfriend. Jason Elkins. 
 Jason Elkins, the football player? 
 Yeah, look... guy like that... rich, famous, handsome, gets more biscuit than a baker, what does he need to beat on women for? 
 Let me talk to him, find out. 
 Let the detectives handle their case, all right, you already did your part, sweetie. 
 They don't have a case. 
 They'll put out the made up description and then drop it. 
 Then let it drop. 
 Wash that out for me. 
 Hey? You got a minute? 
 Uh... 
 Oh, for Pete's sake. 
 
 
 
 [John Fogerty's You Got Nothin' on Me playing] 
 Hodiak : Drew? 
 Drew Mortimer Blassingame. 
 1274 Glenmore Avenue... where, if you keep running, I will be waiting. 
 What are you charging me with? 
 Nothing, you idiot, I said hello and you ran away. 
 What were you doing in the Valley? 
 I wasn't in the Valley. 
 I followed you from the Valley. 
 All right, then you tell me. 
 Two things... one, shuttling colored women out of Watts and parading them around white neighborhoods... why? 
 It's a free country. 
 Two... you're starting to piss me off. 
 What hand do you throw with? You a righty or a lefty? 
 Right. 
 Okay, that's the hand I'm gonna slam in the car door. 
 What, are you serious? 
 Or you can answer me. 
 Answer... answer you what? 
 You've been in the Valley a lot, you throw a rock through a window there too? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You don't... do you know the woman inside the house was hurt? 
 That's assault with a deadly weapon, a felony. 
 I... I did... I didn't want to hurt anybody. 
 Then why'd you do it? 
 My cousin said he'd give me a cut. 
 A cut of what? 
 They're good people. 
 They smell like a damn zoo, but, good people. 
 Roy, though. 
 Roy I don't like. 
 You can't get along with everybody. 
 Does he know who I am? 
 He's just looking out for Charlie. 
 Eh, he should be looking out for himself. 
 I know people who'll put him down just to say they did me a favor. 
 Believe me, I get it, okay. Now forget it, the guy's an ass. 
 But you know what, he didn't mean anything by it. 
 And I'll get your suit cleaned. 
 While we're at it, Detective Hodiak? 
 I got a guy who can take care of him too. 
 Tully. 
 Officer Tully? 
 What do you know about Jason Elkins? 
 Hodiak : For the Rams? I love that guy. 
 So maybe you'd like to meet him with me. 
 Ask him about the number he did on his girlfriend's face. 
 She won't talk, but she has old bruises, she was with him on the night, and Elkins has a record. 
 Yeah, all-pro, all-conference. 
 How about assault when he was in college? 
 Against a woman? 
 No. 
 Well, getting into a bar fight when you're in college is a lot different from pulping your girlfriend. 
 Well, say for a second he's not as good a man as you think he is. 
 I don't think he's good for anything but my wallet when I bet the Rams. 
 Hodiak : Now if she's not testifying, you got nothing. 
 It's he said/she said and she's not saying. 
 [soft piano music] 
 Vivian : When will Emma be home? 
 This week. 
 Unless Ken's mother takes a turn for the worse. 
 Well, send her my best wishes, would you? 
 Of course. 
 Ken isn't with her. 
 Oh, no. That would require a morsel of human feeling. 
 He's very busy. 
 I hated my mother, too. 
 [chuckles] 
 The money... 
 The money that you and Daddy invested into Ken's firm, is there any way to get it back? 
 Why would I want to? 
 Grace : It just... it makes me nervous. 
 Having everything in one place. 
 Vivian : Did he have an affair? 
 Mother. 
 You want to shoot the horse out from under a man, there must be a reason. 
 I...

 I love my husband. 
 When he got you pregnant, you weren't so sure. 
 I need to know. 
 Is there a way? 
 No. 
 No, the money is sunk in the firm. 
 If you want out, you'll have to ask Hal Banyin to write you a check. 
 You used to play this song all the time... that summer between high school and college. 
 Did I? 
 Welcome home, honey. 
 Roast's in the oven. 
 What's going on? 
 Shafe : Hey, Gene. 
 So sorry, I had to change the wash. 
 Hey. Where's Bernadette? 
 She's out back with my mom. 
 Sam asked if he could wait here for you. 
 Wasn't Howard. 
 You sure? 
 Howard's a pinhead, but he's not the pinhead. 
 Why don't... 
 Go to a white neighborhood, and use one colored family to drive a wedge into it, and then when all the white families head for the hills, Gene steps in and buys all the houses cheap, and then sells them back at a huge markup to the only people who will buy: colored families. 
 You rented us this place to scare away our neighbors? 
 No. I did you a favor. 
 You'd rather rent in Compton? 
 I can't believe you. 
 Me? People on your block can't stand the idea of a Negro neighborhood. 
 I'm just giving them what they deserve. 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 [grunts] 
 Her, I'm not pulling off. 
 [grunting] 
 Baby. 
 If you still want to move... 
 Well, here's the good news. 
 If you choose to stay, it'll be rent free. 
 Will he agree to that? 
 He will. 
 You can't argue with free rent. 
 We'll make this okay. 
 Okay? It's gonna be okay. 
 Sam, kick this racist out. 
 My pleasure. 
 Stay for dinner. 
 I thought you wanted to kick the racist out. 
 I'm not asking. 
 Honey, get him something to drink. 
 Wow. 
 Hi, yes, I'd like to speak to Lori Price. 
 A friend. 
 Southeast of Tam Quan, the discovery of North Vietnamese radio antenna by American forces led to days of intense fighting. 
 Air and artillery bombardment threw the 22nd NVA regiment into a disorderly retreat.

 Can I help you? 
 You Walt's dad? 
 You want to come in? 
 No, no, I can't stay. 
 I need you to get a message to Walt. 
 Can you? 
 No. 
 That's why... 
 MP's found out he was with us, came looking for him, he had to split. 
 Where'd he go? 
 That's what I'm saying. 
 I don't know. 
 Took off, parts unknown. 
 Look, Shafe said you were a solid guy, that's why I'm here. 
 But I don't know where Walt went. 
 Frankly, I don't want to. 
 Why is that? 
 I'm worried he might do something, you know? 
 Like something crazy. 
 He's got a gun he got off somebody and... 
 Look, he's a sweet kid. 
 He's just not right, you know? 
 Hey, there's a lot of heat on him, so if you could... 
 I won't bother you again. 
 Robbie : Thanks.

 Why... [chuckles] 
 Why... why did you let me in? 
 Why'd you come? 
 And you can stay. 
 Aren't you expecting Cutler? 
 Oh, no, tonight's a married night. 
 Did you bake him a pie? 
 You love him? 
 If the answer was yes, I'd be glad. 
 I can stand seeing him. 
 When did you realize you couldn't stand seeing me? 
 It wasn't one thing. 
 I was different things every day. 
 You stayed through a lot of them. 
 For Walt. 
 Has Walt told you anything about the war? 
 No. 
 He told me he was in Cambodia. 
 We're not supposed to be there. 
 Walt was. Says he was. 
 He's never been a liar. 
 No, that's true. 
 He wants to go to the newspapers. 
 He's gonna be okay. 
 They won't stop looking for him. 
 He needs to be okay. 
 Katie : I'm scared, Charlie. 
 Nobody's gonna hurt you. 
 Katie : I'm scared for you. 
 Uh... me... 
 Most scared I ever was, I was little. 
 Real tiny. 
 My mama... I woke up one morning and she was gone. 
 Just gone. 
 And I bawled, I yelled, and I kicked the wall so hard, I bust my toe. 
 Manson : Couple hours later, when I saw her coming home, I just hid. 
 She hollered and hollered for me, but I just sat in the bushes waiting. 
 Watched her. 
 That's when I knew. 
 You've got a choice. 
 You can be afraid. 
 Or you can be the thing that makes people afraid. 
 Cut got you on vice? 
 You saying I look like a hooker? 
 I would like to graciously retreat from that comment. 
 Yeah. 
 And say you look lovely. 
 Where are you off to? 
 Friend's party. 
 You're on the clock until 10:00, right? 
 What are you, a cop? 
 [phone rings] 
 Hodiak : Don't. 
 Don't what? 
 What are you going to do? 
 Go to the bar you know Jason hangs out in? 
 Accidentally bump into him, grab a drink, leave? 
 Try to provoke him? 
 All so you can, what, be your own witness in the prosecution of Jason Elkins? 
 You know the girlfriend's in a coma now? 
 If I don't do something, he's just gonna find another girl and do the exact same thing. 
 You want to be that other girl? 
 Best case, you're fired. 
 Worst case, you're dead. 
 I just want it to mean something. 
 What we do. 
 I need it. 
 Well, last I checked, we didn't make the world. 
 So you just got to fight the battles you have a shot at. 
 You know? 
 'Cause nothing lasts.

 Especially winning. 
 Good night? 
 Good night. 
 Good night.
