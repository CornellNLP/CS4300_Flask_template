 Hodiak : Hey, get out here, Dad. 
 You think I don't smell that? 
 In a sec. 
 Hodiak : Just flush it and get out here. 
 Unbelievable. 
 I'm upset. 
 You are unbelievable. 
 You're sure nobody saw you, Walt. 
 I'm not being followed, Dad. 
 Oh, yeah? Well, they're following Robbie Arthur, who is a lousy liar by they way, you with a gun, too crazy for the movement. 
 Comic genius. 
 Why am I here? 
 Just hear him out. 
 He's not wrong about everything.

 Whatever you're thinking of doing, just let me help you do it right, all right? 
 In a way that will keep you safe and out of prison?

 Charlie : When the time comes, it ain't gonna be in no hospital. 
 It's gonna be here. 
 First face he sees smiling down, is gonna be me. 
 He's gonna be so blessed. 
 We don't have any, you know, baby things. 
 Diapers... 
 Cherry. 
 You come from the land of plenty. 
 Did it make you whole? 
 All our boy's gonna need is love. 
 And diapers. 
 woman : Charlie? 
 She says she knows you. 
 Hello, Charlie. 
 Hi, Mama. 
 Offer to give the papers back, we could negotiate. 
 Negotiate? These are liars, murderers. 
 Dad... 
 It's not about me. 
 It's about the truth. 
 Yeah, he's right. 
 Just stay out of it. 
 No, no, no. 
 All right? 
 Once the papers are published, you gotta leave the country. 
 I'm not running. 
 Both of you, shut up. 
 These are state secrets we're talking about. 
 This is treason. 
 I don't care. 
 Well, then at least be smart about it. 
 Give the papers to a reporter, anonymously. 
 Let the newspapers fight the government. 
 They can afford it. 
 We'll get you the best lawyer and cut you a deal... 
 Your son is fighting for what is right. 
 You want to get him a lawyer? 
 Well, what do you know about fighting for anything, Dad? 
 Dad. 
 Anything at all. 
 Dad. 
 What? 
 What happened to you? What happened to you in the war? 
 You came back without a heart. 
 I came back. 
 Yeah. 
 So did Walt. 
 You managed to live through two world wars and the extermination of 6 million Jews without doing anything more dangerous than screwing the band leader's wife. 
 Without a heart? You came back without a soul. 
 Okay, well, you can go be a self-righteous, sanctimonious prick on your own time. This is Walt's decision. 
 This is about Walt. 
 [knocking at door] 
 Where is he? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Why? Why didn't you tell me where you were? 
 Do you know how worried I was about you? 
 Hello, Opal. 
 Duck. 
 Hmm? 
 I know that look. You gotta be quicker. 
 Well, good to have the family back together. 
 So what, you just bring her here to beat up grandpa, or to agree with you? 
 No, your mom hasn't agreed with me since the Dodgers were in Brooklyn. 
 She's here because she helped start this thing. 
 And she's gonna help figure a way out. 
 Please, just tell me how we can make this all right. 
 Walt : Dad has an idea. 
 If it could work... if it could still get the truth out... 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe? 
 Yeah, I'd just like... 
 No, not a word.

 Negro agitators are handing these out. 
 The resemblance is striking. 
 Sanburg : Director Hoover's been very clear. 
 Black Nationalist groups like The RAM, the so-called Non-violent Student Coordinating Committees, and first and foremost, the Black Panther Party, they are all threats to the security and sovereignty of our country. 
 Okay, well, I think we're all appropriately terrified of the colored menace, so... 
 For our surveillance to be effective, we need names. 
 To get these names we need informants, undercover officers, eyes on the ground. You. 
 I have pamphlets. 
 Oh, good. 
 Hodiak : Here's a pamphlet. 
 In order to combat this menace, the LAPD must work with us to disrupt, ridicule, discredit at every opportunity. 
 Maybe we can tie their shoelaces together and give them tittie twisters.

 No disrespect, but he's told me repeatedly that he thinks you're lying. 
 And he's on our side. 
 Mr. Lesick has not just retained council, he's retained Alan Arvitz. Do you know who this is? 
 No. 
 Alan Arvitz is a professor of Law at UCLA, who specializes in police brutality, and the rights of the accused. 
 He's taking on this case pro bono because he thinks we framed an innocent man. 
 His fellow jurists refer to him as the Bone Saw.

 When you were born, your umbilical cord was wrapped around your neck. 
 You were blue and purple and I remembered wondering, if you died, if they'd still let me hold you.

 Maybe a hospital is not such a bad idea, Charlie. 
 We don't have any baby stuff yet. 
 Clothes, diapers...

 Charlie said so. 
 Charlie : You have to learn, Cherry. 
 How many times? 
 Don't be the problem. Be the solution. 
 So, you want baby trinkets so bad, then why don't you take Rick and Sadie and go get some? 
 Charlie, this is no way for a baby to be raised. 
 Ain't you the expert? 
 You come here to just look down on me, huh? 
 No. 
 I came here... to make some kind of peace between us. 
 Honey, I was 16 when I had you. 
 I didn't know what to do. I wasn't ready. 
 But I had my parents to help. I had my family. 
 You think I was better off being raised by your God-jabbering mother?

 Bunchy Carter. 
 Well aware of Mr. Carter. 
 His brother Arthur was murdered last night. 
 We don't have a file on Arthur that I've seen. 
 He was also Bunchy's bodyguard. 
 Looks to me like a case of mistaken identity. 
 Arthur for Bunchy. 
 Rival black nationalist group, then? 
 The Nation of Islam. 
 He used to be a member. 
 You saw what they did to Malcolm X. 
 You have any agents tailing Bunchy? 
 Thanks for the tip with Arthur. 
 We'll start and close a file. 
 There may be something there we can lean on Bunchy with in the future.

 I have something for you. 
 Something Granddad left. 
 His house, and a few acres of land. 
 Good for farming. Not much else. 
 And what am I supposed to do with that? 
 Well, you could sell it. 
 Sign it over to me and... we... 
 I'll split the money with you. 
 I mean, I know with your parole you ain't supposed to leave the state, and he owed a lot of people, probably almost as much as the place is worth, and so if we don't move fast, the state'll take it. 
 How much? 
 After everything, cost of selling, all that, $1,500. 
 Half for each of us. 
 I just need your signature. 
 See, right there. 
 Hodiak : I'm sorry for you loss, Mrs. Carter. 
 I wanted to ask you about your husband's involvement with the Panthers. 
 What involvement? 
 Well, he was Bunchy's bodyguard. 
 He's his brother. 
 He looked out for him a few times when... 
 You know, I don't even owe you that much explanation. 
 Mrs. Carter, Bunchy wants this case solved. 
 No matter what he says to you in private. 
 I know he puts on a good front for the troops. 
 But he wants justice for Arthur even more than he wants to spite me. 
 We didn't have a fight, if that's what you're asking. 
 Okay, so why was he at Bunchy's? 
 Arthur was... paranoid. 
 He thought someone was going through our mail, listening to our phone. Never had any proof. 
 But then when Gordon went away... 
 Who's... who's Gordon? 
 Their other brother. 
 Arrested for having some shotgun he shouldn't have had. 
 Wondered how the police found out about it. 
 Thought somebody was snitching. 
 Who?

 When they sent me off to jail, you were so angry at me.

 For leaving and... for everything. 
 And I was angry at you. 
 I asked you to give me a hug, 'cause you wouldn't be seeing me for a long time, and you wouldn't even look at me and you cussed me out.

 And you ran. 
 Into my arms.
