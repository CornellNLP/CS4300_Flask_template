 Too short. Too short. Too short. 
 Too left-handed. 
 Cerebral palsy. 
 Who else had a key? 
 Three sets of keys, two waitresses, one cook, all at a wedding in Riverside the day Gladner bought it. So... 
 We're at zero. 
 I'm gonna go talk with the grieving widow. 
 The only thing that makes more sense than a drug dealer getting killed over drugs... Is anyone getting killed by someone they married. 
 Look at you. 
 A learner. 
 Now learn this. 
 The widow Gladner is a career gal, and guess what she's the proprietress of. 
 Seriously? 
 Yes, my son. 
 All right, although I'm touched to witness this tender moment of mentoring, I need to remind you lovebirds, you're mooning over each other on my case, my time, and I'm seeing today what I saw yesterday. 
 The doer's your little snitch. 
 Eh, I don't think so. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Blows your drug case to bits, doesn't it? 
 Sammy, tell this kid to put on his big boy undies and make friends with disappointment. 
 Sam : Oh, what do you care, Cut? 
 If Vickery's the guy, then you get all the credit, and if we nab the actual doer, then you get all the credit. 
 I'm the one who's got to visit the grieving widow. 
 That's always a pleasure. 
 You know, I can see her now. 
 She's got her hair in curlers, house dress, arms like bat wings, three housecats, or something like that. 
 Crying, crying, crying, and, yep, there goes another handkerchief. 
 Sammy, you do these things to yourself. 
 Yeah? 
 I know, Cut. I know. 
 (Whistling) 
 I want to help, but I just don't think I have anything to offer. 
 So you had no idea. 
 (Chuckles) Artie was a straight arrow. 
 Never thought to yourself, "hey, my husband runs the Coffee Hut." 
 "How'd he buy me the biggest strip bar in Hollywood?" 
 Burlesque theater. 
 Never thought to yourself, "hey, my husband runs the Coffee Hut." 
 "How'd he buy me the biggest burlesque theater in Hollywood?" 
 No. Guess I should have. 
 (Sighs) I know. I know. 
 I'm not exactly your model grieving widow, but Artie and me, it was never... 
 It was never easy. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Meaning? 
 He was a man. 
 Was he, now? 
 Did you have keys to the Coffee Hut? 
 No, me and Artie had not shared much in a long time. 
 Anybody from your place have keys to his place? 
 No, sir. 
 Well, I'm awfully sorry I couldn't help. 
 Well, Lucille, you never know. 
 (Pounding on door) 
 (Door unlocks) 
 He called the house, that man that has Emma. 
 He played a song. Emma was singing. 
 I know her voice. 
 Grace. 
 I couldn't even look at Ken after that. 
 I did this. 
 I called her a whore right before she ran away. 
 Her face turned white like I had slapped her, and I was so relieved. 
 I knew that if she's hurt by that, then she's still a girl, and she's still my little girl. 
 Okay, okay. 
 We're gonna find her, all right? 
 Don't worry. 
 Don't worry. 
 I made this for you, Charlie. 
 For me? 
 (Laughs) Wow, wow. 
 That makes me know you love me like I love you. 
 (Car approaching) 
 (Car door shuts) 
 What can I do you for? 
 Emma. 
 I'd love to help you. 
 Yes, you would. 
 Man, peace. 
 Officer, man, peace. 
 For Pete's sake. 
 Look, she was here for a small time, but that little bird took flight. 
 If I had her, I'd give her to you. 
 I'm not trouble's maker, man. 
 You're the man. 
 You're my father. 
 Cut the act. 
 I'm not a 16-year-old girl. 
 She's not here, man. 
 Look around. 
 I'm looking at you. 
 Can we feed you, Officer? 
 Our pantry, it's meager... 
 If you see her, hear anything... 
 (Car door shuts) 
 (Car engine starting) 
 (Engine starting) 
 What the hell? 
 Oh, there you are. 
 We thought we killed you. 
 What are you doing? 
 We were hungry. 
 Huh? 
 (Groans) You guys left the fridge open? 
 Where's Manson? 
 We don't know. He left us for you. 
 I... 
 Get out. 
 Go. 
 Just get out. 
 You, too. Go. 
 But it's just a little mess. 
 Get out! 
 But we had so much fun. 
 You know, Charlie wants us to stay. 
 We can do whatever you want. 
 Yeah. 
 I want you to go before I call the cops, you dumb box. 
 You won the lottery here. 
 Two naked girls? God, you liked that plenty... 
 Oh, okay, okay. 
 Let's go, Cherry. 
 You know what? 
 You're disgusting. You know that? 
 The things you like, what we did for you. 
 You know how it felt when you turned me around? 
 It felt like nothing. Oh, God. 
 I was so scared it would hurt until I saw how tiny you are. 
 All right. Get out. 
 Go! 
 (Yelps) 
 Bye-bye, tiny thing. 
 (Vacuum whirring) 
 Randall :  Come on, Ken. All I said was...  
 No, I said I'd bundle $250,000 because you said you'd donate 50 grand. 
 Now, you're lying to me or Ronnie Reagan, and Nancy will eat your eggs for brunch. 
 So if I were you, Randall, and I thank the Holy Ghost I am not, I would write that check... 
 Yesterday. 
 The Republican Party thanks you. 
 (Door slams) 
 (Knocking on door) 
 Fisher : Yeah? I'm coming. 
 Hey, Rue. 
 Hey. 
 Manson : How are my girls? 
 I asked them to leave. 
 (Laughs) 
 Now, why would you go and do a little thing like that? 
 Fisher : Why? 
 They ripped through all my... my kitchen's a mess, man. 
 You should see this place. 
 They're little girls. 
 They're not little girls, man! 
 Little girls... 
 They're my little girls! You don't know where they... 
 I told them to leave, so they left! 
 You pushed my girls on the street? 
 What is it... 
 You call me if you hear from them, now. 
 Cutter :  Badge number 5919 come in, over. 
 Right here. 
 Right where? 
 And is this somewhere that clears the damn Gladner murder? 
 I got Vickery whining, "get me a lawyer or a taxi." 
 Are you finding me a viable replacement, or am I gonna let my only suspect go? 
 Look, I'll be there in 10. 
 Oh, hey, don't hurry on my account. Out! 
 (Door buzzing) 
 Aw, man. 
 Come on. I'm gonna puke. 
 Kicking? 
 It is a mild habit, Mom. 
 You're an idiot. 
 Who is going to die in the pen, so whatever you want, no. 
 I want to keep you out of the pen. 
 How? 
 By verifying your alibi. 
 Give me something, 'cause right now all you got is folks saying they saw you run screaming from the scene. 
 Man, I was screaming 'cause I look in the window, and... dead body laying on the floor. 
 Do you get how heavy that is? 
 Where were you before? 
 I was home. 
 No, you weren't. 
 You don't think we checked that? 
 So whoever you were with, you need to tell me, so we can get 'em on record. 
 I'll bring 'em in. 
 I'd rather go to prison. 
 You're looking sick. Man, I can help with that. 
 Come on. 
 You're not gonna give me "H." 
 No? 
 'Cause... 
 The evidence locker's that way. 
 First, your alibi. 
 Man, come on. 
 (Sighs) This cat can crush me. 
 Look, the man's got 20 Gladners. 
 Gladner is nothing. 
 Oh, now you really want to meet him. Okay. 
 That's great. 
 You are not a good person. 
 Tell you what, I get you out of here, you go talk to this fat cat, I don't exist. 
 Better? 
 'Cause I've got so many reasons to trust you? 
 Actually, I am the only person you can trust right now. 
 I need to kill myself. 
 Wait a minute. So you want to take the one and only suspect in my murder case out on a field trip, why? 
 You know what, don't answer that. 
 It's gonna be a word salad of three things I hate. 
 Boring, complicated, and useless. 
 It's not like Vickery's gonna get away from me. 
 And he could take me up the food chain to the actual source of the heroin. 
 Sam, can you muzzle this mutt before I beat his ass with a newspaper? 
 No, but I'll sell tickets. 
 Officer : Call at the desk about Mrs. Hodiak. 
 Bartender at McGillicuddy's says she's won't stop crying. 
 He doesn't know what to do. 
 Is today the 15th? 
 Uh, yeah. I forgot. 
 Um, I should go. 
 You should if you were her husband. 
 Man :  Sorry. Had to call someone. 
 She's been over there crying since I opened. 
 Bad for business. 
 Hmm, yeah. 
 If your regulars wanted to listen to a woman cry, I guess they could stay at home, right? 
 Can you help me out here instead of busting my hump, Sam? 
 A little early in the day for you even, considering. 
 Tell me what the note said. 
 Walt's note. 
 Let me guess, you'll slap my face if I don't. 
 Opal, you been sleeping? 
 Yeah, I've been sleeping. 
 I've been sleeping and dreaming about Walt. 
 It said, "I'm not running." 
 "I'm doing what I have to do. I love you." 
 Then just his name. That's it. 
 What are you gonna do to find him? 
 What am I gonna do to find him? 
 Yeah. 
 I thought I was the bad guy, and now I'm supposed to find him? 
 I was listening to him when he was on the phone. 
 He thought I was in the tub. 
 He called Dave Vitrano. 
 Pop Warner football Dave Vitrano? 
 Pat Vitrano's son? 
 Yeah, you're the detective. 
 (Scoffs) 
 It's unfortunate you couldn't have told me this earlier, Opal. 
 I just... 
 Is there any other information you want to dribble out right now? 
 Okay, just find him. 
 Then you can say anything you want to me, but right now please shut up and find him. 
 Um... 
 Cut know what day it is today? 
 Yeah, well, um... 
 Happy Birthday. 
 Thanks for not singing. 
 Cut's a great singer. 
 Yeah, just ask him. 
 Sam :  He called you from his mother's house, didn't know she was listening. 
 Did he come here? 
 I just want to help him. I'm not here as a cop right now. 
 Well, maybe Walt doesn't know that. 
 That's what he said? 
 I didn't talk to him. 
 Dave, I can get your phone records. 
 I can see who called here and for how long. 
 I thought you said you weren't a cop, right... 
 Did he say where he was going? 
 Mr. Hodiak, I don't... 
 Did he ask for money? 
 I don't have any money. 
 Why are you here? 
 My mom... the icebox motor broke, so I just came... 
 No, why are you here? Why are you not there? 
 I'm a seminarian. 
 Ah. 
 Our Lady Queen of Angels. 
 Huh. 
 Is that a new thing, or is that something you always wanted to be, a priest? 
 It's hard to believe, I guess. 
 No. It's convenient. 
 I fought, so we could sit here free on plastic slipcovers. 
 Does God not believe in that anymore? 
 No, I know he does... 
 Shut your mouth. 
 Do you know where Walt is? 
 Go fix your mother's icebox motor. 
 Can I have some? 
 Your wife okay? 
 Not even on her best day. 
 Sorry. 
 Listen, I appreciate everything you've done for me on Gladner, but maybe Cutler's right, huh? 
 Oh, you don't want to say that out loud. He might hear you, and you know how objectionable he is right now. 
 Vickery could have done it. 
 What do I know? 
 About homicide? Not much. 
 Fortunately I do, and I stink at taking advice, so onward to glory, young buck. 
 (Sultry music playing) 
 I swear none of us knew any of that drug stuff until we read it in the papers. 
 Art wasn't like that. 
 He was... 
 "Sweet." 
 "Generous." 
 "Fun." 
 "Loving." 
 "All man, all the time." 
 (Crying) All the girls were crazy about him. 
 Sam :  How'd the boss feel about that? 
 Boss? Oh, Mrs. G. Well, I wouldn't call her the boss. Art ran things. Did he, now? It was his place, and we were his family. Rachel, will you... will you help me get a picture here? Um, the Gladners are married, but, you know. They're... they're fun. You know? Getting there. Woman : Oh, you're ticklish. Lucille liked to get dressed up, go out, big groups. She called it "fanning her tail." You know, peacocking. Oh, that's a fresh one. But Art, he just liked to stay in, you know? But he was the boss here and at the Coffee Hut. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And he cared, you know? I mean, not that Lucille doesn't. She's a nice woman, but Art... Colors... your colors are running. (Chuckles) You know, he made me feel, I don't know, taken care of. Even if it was something stupid. (Sniffles) Like, God, this one time, I accidentally left my purse at the Coffee Hut, and it got locked in. Well, he was such a gentleman. He took care of everything. Yeah. You say your purse got locked in? Yeah. (Sniffles) Sam : Hey, Marvin. Hey. I heard a funny story about you from Rachel at the Peach Pussycat. She says hi, by the way. Seems one night she went over to visit Art Gladner. They "chatted" in the bathroom for a little while, and she had to go be onstage. He had to go. He had a meeting. She left. He locked up. What'd she forget? Her purse. Do what I'm doing. Just like that. And who did Lucille Gladner tell her to call to go pick up that purse? You. Because even though you deliver to 70 other eateries in the greater Los Angeles area, Art Gladner trusted you. Which is odd, considering that you have nine arrests and two convictions for a whole other type of delivery. Schedule-A narcotics. But that didn't seem to bother old Art. No. He even gave you your own... Yahtzee! Oh, come on. Okay there, Marv. Your gun on the ground. Now. Mmm, no. Do it! You're armed. You should come get it. You got a 20% chance of getting it that way, or you can run. Then you got 100% chance that I'm gonna shoot you, so... (Inhales deeply) What's it gonna be, Marvin? Come on. I don't have all day. Chop-chop. All right, look. Let me make it easy for you. (Groaning) Oh, okay. That's all right, Marv. No shame in trying. Here, give me that arm, man. This part's gonna hurt. (Screams) God, that hurts so much. You broke it, you prick. The hospital's a short stroll that-a-way. No? Okay. Thanks, that's... wow. You should do that professionally. We're a ways from the whole picture, but your little pal Vickery is free to go. Damn it. What? No, I've got Vickery primed to take me to his alibi, and he's pissing in his shorts about it. No threat of jail, no way he takes me to him, and I want him. It sounds like he's higher up in all this than any of these cats. Great, so don't tell him. Nobody saw me bring this guy in. He hasn't even been booked yet. As far as anybody knows, Vickery's still the only suspect. Wait, you're saying let him keep thinking he's on the hook? News travels slow. Okay, but that would be illegal. (Sighs) Don't brag when it works. I'm trying to clear up the dates here. Look, I hate to piss on your mood, but Lieutenant wants a post-mortem on our breakup. Now? Both of us. Fantastic. Lieutenant Priore, it's Cut. Maybe he's having a think. 
 
 (Knocking on door) Lieutenant? Oh, Sam! Hey, get an ambulance in here! What the... come on. This is the worst milkshake, like, ever. Okay, Mikey. How do you ruin a milkshake? You do this right, I'll buy you a dairy farm, okay? What I want is the smack that you promised me. Let's just go over it again. I got it, okay? I rap with him long enough for you to get a good look at him, try to get him to talk about associates or locales. Okay, you ready? Oh, my God. I swear to God. Just leave the milkshake. They put garlic in this thing, man. Just to piss on my day more. Fine, fine. Let's go. Ugh, stop drinking it. They're after me, man. Why are you acting so... 'Cause, man, they're after me! They're after me. They? Badges, they? Yeah, for something I didn't do. Okay, you got to go. Whoa, Guapo, Guapo. Okay, it was that night that you and me, you know, we went to go pick up that stuff from your cousin? Then you got a problem 'cause I'm telling you, me and you, we never hung out, and I don't got a cousin. You dig? Don't do this to me, man. It's murder. Okay, I didn't do it. Far out. They picked you up on Art Gladner, didn't they? Yes, man! Yes! You know I didn't do it then, yeah? All right, all right, all right. Cool out. They already got somebody for that, so you're off the hook, man. Now I want to talk about why you think it's okay to come here, you stupid munchbag. No, it's just that you're my alibi, man, and I know you had nothing to do with it. I know you didn't because even if you did, man, I wouldn't... Shut up. Shut up! Hey, Mike! (Groans) We gotta be on the road an hour ago. Ladies are waiting. (Tires screeching) Aw, man. I need a joint. Shafe : So much for power of surprise. Guapo already heard we picked somebody up by the time Mike got there. Well, I broke Marvin's arm. That's something people notice and discuss. So Lieutenant Priore, huh? Yeah. Heard they carried him out on a stretcher. Yeah, I don't know. It's serious. The only thing I can predict with any confidence is whose ass will be keeping Priore's seat warm. Cutler? Oh? Heard it's already happening. Sam :  Comfy, Marv? Actually, no. Good. Okay, reduced sentence far from anyone with anything to do with the man you're about to name. Terms as discussed. Okay. Start from the beginning. Give it some texture. Killing Gladner, whose idea was it? Yours. Let's start over. Killing Gladner, whose idea was it? Yours. You want a deal? (Groans) You want it in writing? Here. How's that? Gladner : You need to be in front of it. This cop Hodiak's got a boner for me. No! Absolutely not! Immunity and a plane ticket. You tell him I'll name 10 guys just like me, and I'll give him the name, rank, and serial of the man we all work for. I'm telling you, he's about to sing your name from the rooftops, man. (Sighs) Thanks for coming to me. Good choice on your part. There's one more thing I want you to do. It's a walther, just like James Bond. (Clicks) Hey, hey! Ah! No! (Screaming) Well, thank you, Marv. I'll get that typed up. Hey, you got the right guy, just like I knew you would. Some of my finest detecting. And maybe you uncovered a drug ring. Ooh, steak dinner for me. (Whispers) Jackass. So now we know Guapo is  importante. Meanwhile it's our fault. What is? Gladner, the snitch thing. It's not our fault. It's my fault. And you're okay with this? Yeah. Man, he was a person. Who sold drugs. Cashew? You are unbelievable. Like the world just... You want it, you do it. It's true. I can be a tad brusque. For instance, just now I forgot to say, "you're welcome." (Sultry music playing) (Inaudible) Detective. Thought you might like to know we solved your husband's case. Well, thank you. Thank you so much. May I call you Sam? You just did. Turns out it was drug related. Oh. Yes. Marvin, your delivery guy, was a drug courier for your husband. Well, you just never know anyone, do you? If you're lucky. Oh, by the way, Rachel told me to tell you... Mmm. She really enjoyed talking to you. Is that right? It's very interesting, because she spent the whole time crying. It was cathartic. Mrs. Gladner, comes to lying, I teach a master class, and you flunk. (Sniffing) Lucky for you, I don't give a rat's ass about drugs. Double lucky the la Narco Squad couldn't tie a known monkey to a kilo of bananas. But don't let anybody drop dead near you again, or I'll be on you before the body hits the ground. You'll be on me again no matter what. Hold on a second. Hey, Shafe. You married? Why? It's some broad. Says she's your wife. Sounds legit. She's crying. Thought you were a fairy. Who knew? Honey, what is it? Wait, slow down, slow down, slow down. God! Kristin : I told you I didn't like this place. I told you. I know. You fit. We don't. Hey, Cut told me... whoa. What happened here? Nothing anymore. Who did that? No idea. What about Baldilocks next door? Howard? I thought you liked him. Sam : I do think old cranks are funny, but if he wrote something nasty on your garage door, I got an ax handle in my trunk. I don't think it was him. Probably sat by with a bucket of popcorn and watched whoever did do it, but... What's... you all right? My son. His name's Walt. He was overseas, Da Nang. He's... he's AWOL right now. I'm sorry, Sam. Went... I went by to see a friend of his, a kid studying to be a priest. He kept saying he hadn't heard from Walt. I just wanted to slap the taste right out of his mouth. You know, you may not want to make that layer any thicker. You know, anymore paint, and it'll run and sag. I got to hurry back. Why don't you come in for a minute? You know, Bernadette's still up. Got a feeling you like babies more than grown-ups, and, uh... I got to get going. Thank you. See you. (Car door opens) Hi. Yeah, um, I'm looking for Robbie Arthur. Brian Shafe. We served together. 173rd Airborne. All right, yeah. No, I was just hoping to talk to him. If, uh, you could just pass on the message. About a kid who was over there, made corporal, but just went AWOL. No. No, I don't know him. He's the son of a friend of mine. Thank you. (Cooing) ♪ your home is where you're happy ♪ 
♪ it's not where you're not free ♪ 
♪ your home is where you can be what you are ♪ 
♪ 'cause you were born to just be ♪ 
♪ now they'll show you their castles and diamonds... ♪ Charlie! You did this. You did this to me. I have nowhere to go because of you. What exactly did I do, friend? You know. You know. I freed you. (All gasping) You broke me. Manson : You were already broken, Ken. I just pulled you out of your shell. I saved you. I got nothing but love for you. That's all I got. That's all I am. Love. Right here. You take it if you need to. I'm not scared of dying. I want to die for you. For any of you! It'd be my privilege, my birthright. So go on. I love you. (Sobbing) It's all right. Who you are is all right. (Cocking) (Sobbing) You need to go home. I can't. Then stay. That acid kicking in yet? Turn around and leave. I found her, Grace. Are you joking? Where is she? Commune. They call it the Spiral Staircase. She looked okay. No. No, I went there with Sam. She's not there. She is now. You saw her, and you didn't... Let's get in the car, get our girl, and we can all come back together. I need my family. No. I'll go with someone I can trust to get her. I need a man for this. I can't risk it getting tangled up like everything you touch or look at or... Now... You need to leave. I'm not going. This is my home. Says who? Manson : (Distorted) You get back what you put out. That's karma. That's the balance of your own will. You got to be judged by your own God, inside your own soul. That devil, the pig who wears the crown? He locked me up, too, to teach me a lesson. So I found my truth inside me. It's in you. I see it. This is who you are. Glorious daughter of Eve. You're so beautiful, you... you hurt my eyes. Look at her, our child. She's the mirror to all of us. She is you, and you are... Mother. Emma, honey, I found you. You're safe now. It's time to go home, okay? Okay, Mommy. Take me home. Grace : Okay, sweetheart. Just take my hand, and let's go home. Okay? Okay. Grace : You're safe now. (Chuckles) Emma, you don't belong here. This is not your home. I do belong here. Emma, they don't love you. They do. What did they do to you? No! No! Sweetheart, please come home. No! Emma, calm down. No! No! No! You can't take me away from my family! You can't take me away from him! No. Sweetheart, calm down. Put the gun down. Stay there. No. No. Grace : Emma, you're gonna get in that car, and we're gonna go home right now. Emma : No, you can't make me. Emma, baby, calm down. Don't move! (Gunshot) (Yelling indistinctly) Aah! No! What? No! Let her go! (Indistinct shouting) Don't let them take me! You... you stay away from her. You all stay away from my daughter. Everybody relax. She'll be back. Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Stop! Let me down! No! I'm not Emma! I'm not Emma! I'm not Emma! Stop! You're the devil! I hate you! I hate you! No! Let me out of here! Let me out! A liar and a whore! (Indistinct screaming) Let me out of here! Stop! Stop the car! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie, help me! Charlie!
