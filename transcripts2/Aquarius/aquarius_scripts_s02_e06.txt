 Previously on "Aquarius"... 
 I love you, Bri. You're warm. I think I have a fever. Everybody's doing the funny. Tina Greenwood, reported missing right after Thanksgiving. That's the same girl you went to high school with. Vineland High is a big place. You guys remember the first missing girl from high school? And I can't shoot my wad on a hunch. You will help Dick Nixon on a take the White House. Your lives are going to be lived completely in the public eye. You do not live apart. You do not get divorced. We sold the house. Here's the new address. Where have you been hiding that voice? Charlie, I thought you were the only one in the family that could sing. Terry? Good to see you, man. Hi, I'm Terry. Oh, I know who you are. Charlie Manson. ♪ Gettin' so mixed up I can't make myself believe ♪ 
♪ That the purpose of a woman could ever be to... ♪ 
♪ No this I can't, I can't believe ♪ Hey, hey, that's mine. Oh, sorry, sir. Well, I... ha. I don't want it now. You touched it with your black paw. ♪ Still but I can't believe ♪ 
♪ I can't believe ♪ 
♪ Said I can't believe ♪ Hey. Who's the new Mr. Groovy? That's Gregg something. He's a producer. He's tight with Terry. Well, if he's tight with Terry, why... why ain't you making him happy? He wants Boots. Dennis wants Boots too. Dennis wants everybody. Who... who's Boots? Melcher's girl in the million-dollar boots. Melcher, Dennis, Greg... they all want her. Men think they want fancy puss, but they don't. They want you, my alley cats, barefoot and free. Go give Terry what he don't know he wants. Come on, Joey. Bring the ball back. Joey, will you hurry up! Come on, let's go! Well, she's the right age and height to be Tina Greenwood, but the body's too decomposed to identify. Lucky it was pouring rain, or the kid never would've found the corpse. There's skin tissue left on the ribs. Maybe I can extract imbedded fabric, ID blouse, panties. Show some respect, huh? We treated the Viet Cong better. Trying to gross him out? What you really got? These look like what the mother described in the missing persons report. Yeah. I'll show them to her. [jewelry clatters] Filbert? ♪ Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-do-wah ♪ After McCarthy's strong showing in New Hampshire put President Johnson out, Robert Kennedy's late entry into the contest for the Democratic Party's nomination has been labeled as ruthless opportunism. Ruthless or not, if Kennedy wins the California primary, he will be the front-runner. ♪ Only the lonely ♪ The enthusiastic crowds Robert Kennedy's drawing... some have likened it to a rock star's... could make the late president's brother irresistible to party delegates at a brokered convention. ♪ Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah ♪ 
♪ Know this feeling ain't right ♪ Winning next week's California primary is seen as crucial for Robert Kennedy to become the Democratic nominee, the probable Republican Party candidate Richard Nixon. ♪ They're gone forever ♪ He is a beauty. ♪ So far apart ♪ 
♪ But only the lonely ♪ ♪ I cry ♪ 
♪ Only the lonely ♪ 
♪ Dum-dum-dum-dumby-do-wah ♪ Sure. ♪ Only the lonely ♪ That Bobby's a thug. Yeah. Worst cheater of the Kennedys. He'd kill his own mother to get his skinny ass in the White House. McCarthy's polling only five points behind Bobby in California. We've got to help McCarthy win here. Stop Bobby in California, and he'll be dead. I just don't trust this kid. Okay, then why don't you ask him to take a lie detector test? 'Cause I don't want to waste my time gathering evidence that's not admissible. And not taking a polygraph? That's wasting time. You could eliminate him. This is the 20th century, Sam. All the big boys are using them. I hate the 20th century, okay? Here's how you're gonna handle him. Me? Yeah. He's already got his defenses up with me. What I want you to do is, I want you to... I know, I know. The doughnuts, to relax him. No. The doughnuts are to fortify you. You look dead on your feet. Act like you think he's innocent. If I think he's innocent, then why am I questioning him? Because I'm making you. Bitch and moan about it. If he buys that you think you're wasting your time, maybe he'll slip up. Okay, uh... I'm gonna level with you. You want to know the real reason why you're here? Because Detective Hodiak hates everybody under the age of 30. He hates the 20th century. [laughs] The whole century. Am I under arrest? If I'm under arrest, I want to call my lawyer. Okay. Yeah, I mean, we can. Oh... why you want a lawyer? You guilty of something? Give the guy a break, Hodiak. He can't answer a few simple questions without a lawyer? Okay, now, I definitely want to talk to my lawyer. You get a lawyer, you get arrested. You get arrested, you get a record. Innocent or not. And trust me, you do not want to go through that. I want to call my lawyer. [overlapping chatter] Wow! Hey, Terry. Glad my girls are making music with you. See, music that'll make the whole world feel how you feel right now. [women chattering] Like mine. [women laughing] What are you doing? What are you doing? Terry, man, man, will you listen, Ter? You promise to hear my new songs? Promise? Yes. Come on, man, yes. That's a sacred promise, Terry. You... you're a man of your word, and your word is your manhood. Yes. Come on, Charlie! So I have your manhood's promise, right? Yes, yes, yes! All right. [laughs] Yeah! All right. Ha ha ha ha! [spits] All right. [rock music] ♪ This world is going down, down, down ♪ It's been four hours. Where's my lawyer? You're five years older than Tina? You would've been graduating college when she was still at Pineland, right? Vineland. Huh? Vineland High. Right. You're too young to go to reunions, right? Tiger games. Went to two playoff games when they reached State. Went with my buddy. He's a Tiger booster. And Tina was a cheerleader. You could've had a long talk with her at a rally and not remembered? It's okay if you tell me now you forgot, how you... did meet Tina. I had Lyons intercept his lawyer. Told him his client was being arraigned. That's a nutty lie. We haven't even booked him. We haven't even arrested him. A nutty lie? [laughs] It's not even a lie. Lyons misheard. Thought he said his client's name was Ben Wheeler. We booked a Ben Wheeler this morning. He's being arraigned downtown now. Come on. Wheeler? Doesn't sound anything like Healy. Wheeler? Wheelie? Wheeler? [mumbling] You... you all right? You coming down with something? You look... Naw... maybe. [coughs] Ugh. I'd like to go home and get some shuteye. No, no, no, no. Here's the thing. You cough on Healy. Make him sweat. You're doing good, Shafe. You got a real lead here with this high school buddy thing. Go in there, get his name, get it to me. I'll call him. We'll play them against each other. Here's how. I know... only way to get you off my back is for me to talk to his buddy. That... that's good. But no, here's the real play. Eat his doughnut. His doughnut? Yeah, yeah. He's keeping it... some kind of security thing. He's holding it in reserve or something, making him feel safe. You go in there, ask him about his high school buddy, then take a big bite of his doughnut. Big bite of his doughnut. Get your, you know, nasty cooties all over it. There's a Sean Boyle on the line, says he's an old friend? The Boiling Man. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [phone rings] Kennedy headquarters. Sean Boyle? In his office. [overlapping chatter] Hey, Samuel. What the hell you doing holed up here? Don't tell me the union actually likes Bobby. You're damn right. He's our best shot to beat Tricky Dick. But Bobby blows with the wind. You know, he started the Vietnam War with his brother, then he handed the hot potato over to LBJ, and now he turns around and accuses Johnson of being a baby-killer. Exactly. Bobby's a winner. That's another reason I called. We're gonna need help. I wanted to hire you with Bobby's security here in L.A. Sorry, I can't moonlight. It's one night. Why not? Take a taste. Private's your future, Sam. Make three times the money. I-I can't. I got to get back. I'm sweating a suspect. So let him sweat for another minute. I got trouble, Sam. I'm being blackmailed by a hooker, and I know it is ridiculous to be scared of a whore, but if she tells Mary, I... I just... I can't let that happen, Sam. She's threatening to tell Mary? Not the union? Ah, the union. The union doesn't give a fart. [sighs] I love Mary, you know? But after four kids, she's put on 60 pounds. She'd rather have a doughnut than me. So... [exhales deeply] I go to hookers. And I pick Irish girls, 'cause they remind me of Mary before she was... you know. You're sentimental. Well, there are these two particular lassies I like, and I've been seeing them kind of regular, so... it's got to be one of them. You're sure there are only two lasses? Yeah, okay, you know me too well. But yes, these are the only two that I was dumb enough to talk to about Mary. And as you can see from these letters, the blackmailer knows how I feel about my marriage. So, find out which hooker, Sam. Find her and, uh... and make her stop. [tense music] Hey. [sniffles] Hodiak says I've got to talk to your high school buddy and then we're in good shape. What's his name? Or you want me to tell him that you refused? Okay. Your funeral. Hey. Hey. It's Phil Gleason. I'll get you his phone number. [guitar music] Dennis. Dennis, come on, man. Gotta go. Got to catch a plane to Frisco. Let's do it. Hey. Hey, Terry? You got time for one song, man? You promised, right, Terry? Promise of your manhood. Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. Sure. Be happy to listen. I'll be back Tuesday for the primary, okay? You should play at my guy's victory celebration, election night. Right on! I'm late, man. Sorry. Got to go. Come on, guys. Got to go! Frisco. ♪ Are you sweet on me ♪ Grace? [chuckles] Grace? Can you introduce Mrs. Nixon before lunch? Me? Why? Well, Bunny Sturdevant's plane is delayed. Someone's got to introduce her. You know her, right? Your husband works for Dick. [laughs] No, no, Becky, you're the secretary. I can't. I break out in hives if I have to speak in public. Please, Grace? Please? Oh, I don't know. You know Pat, right? I've met her a couple of times. Great. You're elected. He's sticking to his story. He never met Tina. You call Gleason's number? Yeah, I just called. I got an answering service. Left a message. Jeez, it's cold, right? [shivering] Listen, Healy's done. He put his head down, passed out. What's the next? Beat him with a phone book? [chuckles] You're sick. I'm the sick one? No, no, no. No, no, no. You're... you're hot. You got a fever. You got something. This ain't the flu. Huh? [ominous music] ♪ ♪ No, you should go home. You're gonna infect everybody. Look, just go home. I'll take over with him. But you get out of here. Take care of yourself. Go. Hello. I'm Grace Karn. [clapping] You know, I remember the first time I realized... well, not realized, but... came to understand who Pat Nixon is. I was a young mother of an adorable two-year-old, who, let's be honest, was running me ragged. [chuckles] [women chuckle] And when I heard Vice President Nixon explain about Pat's... respectable Republican cloth coat and how much their two little girls loved their cocker spaniel Checkers... [chuckles] I don't know. I just... I got so vivid a picture of a family. A modest, hard-working American family. And it made me proud. Not only proud to be a Republican, not only proud to be a citizen of the greatest democracy on Earth, but proud to be a Republican wife and mother. [applause] Change of shift. You got me for the next 12 hours. This is the United States. You can't keep me here forever. I guess you're the expert on what cops can and can't do. What do I know? Oh, I will tell you what I do know. Your high school buddy got back to me. He's gonna be here in 15 minutes. Really? Now, talking to a pretty high school girl ain't a crime. But lying to me about it is, kid. Now, it's up to you to decide whether or not it's smart to stick to your story. 'Cause when your buddy gets here and tells me different, then you're gonna stay here. Forever. He's here. Mr. Gleason's here. Last chance. I got nothing to say. He should be right with us. Mr. Gleason. Detective Hodiak. You didn't go to high school with Ben Healy. You're his lawyer. And his uncle. After you dragged my nephew in here last time, I told Ben, "Cops show up again, keep your mouth shut and call me." Ben's a smart boy. Maybe. But you're stupid. You gave him stupid advice. He got you here by lying to a police officer. That's obstruction of justice. Charge him, Detective. You've held my nephew here for over 24 hours. Is he under arrest? Meg? Take this man to see his nephew, or his client, or whoever he is. And for the record, Healy was never under arrest and nobody told him he was, ever. Or led him to believe he was? I'll be filing an official complaint about this, Detective. Yeah, I'm the one who has a complaint. Your client's way too smart to be innocent. We were all so touched when you said you were proud to be a wife and mother. I mean, Bunny's a pistol, but when we elect a new California chapter president, it would be terrific to have somebody like you who could talk about the joys, the hard work, and how did you put it? Raising your girl. Oh, well... she was a handful. Ran me ragged. Perfect. They do run us ragged. But what job could be more important? How old is your daughter now? She... she's 17. And still your baby, right? And where is she? In college? 
 
 Emma? Good day, sunshine. Wakey, wakey. Now, I need you. I need you, Cherry. Gregg's here. Who? Gregg Jakobson. Terry's friend. Man of music. Sad, restless rooster with no chick he likes. See, Sadie, Patty and Minnie, all wrong. Gregg wants my sweet Cherry-Pop. Which is fine. 'Cause he's gonna give you the answer to the riddle of Melcher. He's sure to know. [rubbing hands] Know what? I-I told you. Gene McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy are running to be dictator of the jailed world. Terry likes one of them. And we have a chance to play for him, if I can find out which one. Cherry-Pop. We're almost at the top of the mountain, and I've got the song to get us there. A song of love, Cherry. About you. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [needle clatters] [lounge music] ♪ ♪ Martini, please. Very dry. Olives. You're assigned to L.A. these days, Agent Copley? Here on a case. Going back in a week. I tracked you down because of the California primary. I'm working for Dick. Good work if you can get it. Nixon's got the Republican nomination sewn up. Well, we're not worried about the nomination. We're worried about facing Bobby Kennedy in the general. I'm sure J. Edgar must be unhappy at the prospect of Bobby becoming President. If he's elected, Hoover could be out. With the dirt we've got on Bobby, the Director could ruin him anytime he likes. Is that what you're after, Ken? Glad to help. More than happy to help you hurt Bobby. Thanks. [lounge music continues] ♪ ♪ You're looking very fit. When the office said you were in L.A., I was disappointed you hadn't called. Oh, man, it worked great. I got the kid to admit he went back to the school, and also it was... funny. [laughs] Really just funny. It was funny? What was funny? All the tricks Sam has up his sleeve for confusing lawyers where their clients are. And you really think that's funny? Railroading people? Well, what? Cat got your tongue? [phone rings] [ringing] Hello? Hi, Sam. You want Bri? He's sick. What? No, he's okay. Hey. Oh, no, I threw up on the way home. I feel fine now. Must have been the doughnuts. What happened? [whispers] Wow... He faked me out. Yeah, okay. Yeah, sorry. I guess I screwed up. Yeah. I'm... yeah, see you tomorrow. Hey, how about that? The suspect we were playing hide and seek with, he faked me out. You must feel like a fool. You told Sam you threw up. Your stomach upset? You nauseous? No, I feel great. Well, Sam said that you were... Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I was, but I'm fine now. I'm great. [background chatter] [phones ringing] [inhales deeply] Oh! Hot pastrami on rye. Spicy mustard and coleslaw, and a Cel-Ray soda. [gasps] You remembered! David, I will keep them coming every Tuesday for the next month if you tell me everything you know about these two lovely ladies of the evening. Angel Ready. That's got to be her nomme de fellatio. Her address is 2395 Highland. That is... Gina Lombardi. Lombardi. Not Irish? She's not Irish. Not Irish. Well, she has fair skin and blue eyes, but her real name is Lombardi. Huh. She should be Irish. Lady Ann. Oh, I know her! Lady Ann is Becky Stein. Stein? A shonda for my people. [laughs] Stein and Lombardi. That sounds like an unholy law firm. Either of those girls ever dabble in extortion? Extortion? Why bother? They're hundred-dollar girls, no taxes. And they have a decent pimp. A decent pimp? He's decent... for a pimp. But we're talking about one pimp? Yeah. I thought that's the connection you'd made. These girls have the same pimp. Hey, honey? You have trouble sleeping? How late were you up? I'm dropping Bernadette off at Mom's and going to class. Why don't you get in bed? You're off today, right, honey? You can sleep all day. [Bernadette coos in background] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ The pimp's name is Martin O'Reilly. He placed the ads you answered. At least he's Irish. And you think he's the blackmailer? Got to be. The girls would never blackmail a client without his say-so. He'd kill them. Why would this O'Reilly want to blackmail me? That's the mystery. You're too good a client to blow up. O'Reilly's generous with the right people at Vice, but if I turn up the heat that'll change. I'll talk to him, and he will stop. Thanks, Sam. You really... you really are saving my life. Senator! Senator! Senator, Senator! There's someone here I want to introduce. No, Sean... Senator Kennedy, this is the old war buddy of mine I was talking to you about. He's L.A.'s top homicide detective, Samson Hodiak. None of that is true. But it's a pleasure to meet you. And I'll give your hand a rest. It looks like... I'll save your hand. Well, thanks. Campaigning's not hard labor, but it isn't easy on the hands. Detective, you're law enforcement. Let me ask you, especially here in Los Angeles, what, in your opinion, can be done to improve relations with the black community on both sides? I don't really have any ideas, sir. Be blunt with me. Nothing, sir. Nothing can be done. Nothing? People don't change. There are good ones and bad ones. It's my job to keep the bad away from the good. That's all I can do. Well, I disagree. You're right. Your job isn't to change people, but you supply the most important service a government can supply to its citizens. Justice. That's what's make them change. Now, I insist. You're too important a man to skip shaking hands with. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ If you want privacy, shut the door. What do you want, Grace? Bunny Sturdevant's been elected president of the National Federation of Republican Women. That leaves the California chair vacant. I want to replace her. Will you help me make that happen? Sure. I'd like to. How can I? Bunny nominating me would help. She won't? She thinks of me as a housewife. I'll tell Haldeman to educate her. Thanks. You're welcome. Ken, what should I say about Emma? They all ask about her. What do I tell them? What we tell the people at the club. Emma's taking a year in Europe. Well, what will I say after a year? She's married, on the east coast. I don't know. They'll stop asking. You know, I'm really interested, Ken, in your political work. Happy to be a sounding board. I used to be. I'd like us to be close again, Grace. You've been doing a lot of research on Kennedy. You really think he can win the nomination? Yeah. He's by far the most charismatic candidate. He's got his daddy's ruthlessness, his brother's good looks and... something vital for a leader to have. What's that? He knows what it is to be hurt. He had a terrible time after his brother's assassination. Holds himself responsible, told his friends, "I have blood on my hands." He's... he's suffered. You almost sound as if you like him. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. I can't stand his politics. ['60s rock] ♪ You're the kinda guy who likes to mess around ♪ 
♪ I'm chasin' after every... ♪ That's a nice car. Can I see the inside of it? I'd have to be nuts, Detective,  to blackmail a client. Especially an oil well like your friend. Oil's been seeing my girls three times a week for two years. Three times a week? At a hundred bucks a pop? These are fresh girls, right off the bus from the Midwest. Pink all over. And they all think they're actresses, so they're happy to play any part you like, Detective. On the house. Mmm... Well, unfortunately, now that you've made that very generous offer, I can't not hit you. Pardon? That's a double negative, so I understand that can be confusing. What I mean to say is... [groans] You're still a pimp. [grunts] ♪ ♪ 
♪ And I'm gonna knock ya flat ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ Look out, Dad... ♪ Clean Gene, Baby Bobby... they're both against the war. Tricky Dick, too. Even Humpty Dumpty has a peace plan. You mean everyone's against the war? Oh, they call for peace. Peace, peace. But all they do is make war, war, war! They're insane, Cherry. All of the would-be kings are mad. Read it. [knock at door] Sam, what are you doing here? It's not the pimp. Shh! Hey, Mary's here. Three times a week for two years? There's no way that pimp's blackmailing you. You're his pension fund. It's got to be somebody else close to you. Maybe somebody in the union. Some buddy that sees you sneak out three times a week? What do you think, I share the intimate details of my married life with a shop steward? What details? All the letters say is that you go to whores because you can't stand touching your wife anymore. Do you have to be so loud? I only confessed that to the whores. Your new flunky's on the phone. He says he needs you. Oh, yeah, I gotta take that. You remember Sam Hodiak. We served together. Do you want some coffee? It's a fresh pot. Oh, no thank you. I've actually got to get going. You're a detective, right? Guilty. What a handy friend to have. A man who can lock up your enemies. [Sean speaks softly in background] Well, what's done is done. Mary, I've got to go. Sam, can I walk you to your car? No, I'm actually... I'm gonna have a cup of coffee with Mary. Oh, okay. I'll see you later. I bore him four children, and he won't even kiss me on the lips. Are you gonna tell him, or should I? Is he suffering all day long? I think you've made your point. No, no. When you tell him that all his scrambling to hide his whoring from me was a pathetic farce, that's when I've made my point. I want to get you in the studio. I'm serious. Your voice is amazing. Oh, you're crazy. I can get you in. Yeah. We'll do a duet. A duet? Yeah, me and you. With me? Of course. It's ready, Dennis. My new song. [strumming guitar] ♪ Pretty girl ♪

We're going all the way, and you're the guy that's gonna make it... I'm not here to be a bodyguard, Sean. You know why I'm here. Martin O'Reilly, the pimp, is missing. Good. You probably scared him off. Where'd your genius boys bury him? I hope it's not the Tar Pits. Come on. Why would I bother with that scum? You yourself said he wasn't responsible. And by the time I told you that, it was too late to call your boys off. There must have been a thousand guys who wanted to kill that creep. Would you stop with that, or I will pound you into the ground. I'd like to see you try that, Sam. I may look like I've gotten soft, but you're gonna have to prove that. I fingered him for you.

[cheers and applause] Just wait here. Wait here for a second. What? [pop music] All right. Hold on a second. Sam, we can't take Bobby out the front. This crowd is too big. It's too out of control. You've got to help us, please. He's gonna be the next President, Sammy. All right. I know this hotel. Get the cars around to the service entrance. We'll take Kennedy out through the kitchen.
