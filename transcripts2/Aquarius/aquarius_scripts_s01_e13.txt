 Ken : Tell me... 
 Where's Grace? 
 Bridge... she says. 
 Ken : Tell me. 
 You were there too. 
 I've been here... on the phone... with the Committee chair. 
 Charlie's... two weeks ago... 
 I saw you. 
 Ken : I'm serious, Charlie. 
 I'll make sure the cop leaves you alone, but you do the same. 
 [Manson laughs] 
 My Kenny Ken. 
 Guardian angel. 
 Hal : Makes sense, actually. 
 What about any of this makes sense? 
 Charlie gives us what we both need. 
 He lets us be who we can't. 
 Isn't that right, Ken? 
 Manson : All righty, boys, all clear. 
 Bring her on out. 
 Hal : You better be careful. 
 You know what you're doing? 
 You don't... 
 Better make sure there's nobody out there. 
 I'm gonna help you out. 
 Watch it. 
 Manson, watch the... watch the rail. 
 Hal : Charlie knows, doesn't he? 
 About what? 
 What we crave... both of us. 
 I don't crave this... obsession to... to hurt... 
 What do you think your marriage is, Ken? 
 Huh? 
 Disappearing for days to binge on rent boys. 
 Just tell me what happened tonight, Hal. 
 Tonight. 
 That time I saw him again... that time I saw Charlie again, before the Nixon fundraiser... 
 What are you talking about? 
 It all came back. 
 Banyin likes to meet 'em... meet 'em and beat 'em. 
 I tried, Ken, I tried for years to stop myself. 
 I mean, I... I did. 
 But these girls that Charlie finds... 
 I went to him. I... I begged him to find me a girl who could take it. 
 He said, "Hell, man", "I don't have a girl who could take it. 
 I'll find you one who loves it." 
 Hal : Sadie. 
 And he was right. 
 We were perfect. 
 Ken : So that's who... 
 Tonight. 
 No. 
 No. It wasn't her. 
 He said today, for some reason, she wasn't available. 
 So he found me another girl. 
 Manson : Meet Janet. 
 Janet, meet Hal. 
 Hal. I love that name. 
 She just stopped breathing. 
 I... 
 I must have hit an artery or something. 
 I got... The blood... 
 I didn't know what to do. 
 Come on, Janet. Come on, sweetheart, please. 
 Please, please wake up. Please. 
 Somebody help me! 
 Help me! 
 Come on, Janet, please. 
 Kenny, please. 
 Wait. 
 The girl tonight, you left her there? 
 I came right over. 
 Emma : Free. Free. 
 Free. 
 Hodiak : I beg to differ. 
 Coffee? 
 Are you old enough for coffee? 
 I've been hearing things. Maybe kids shouldn't... 
 Fried-egg sandwich? 
 Come on. Eat up. 
 No? 
 Nothing says abandon all hope like cold eggs. 
 Pullin' a Gandhi, huh? 
 Well, I'm starved. 
 Grace : Emma? 
 Honey, please. Enough. 
 I want to help. Tell me how to help you. 
 My boys, my boys. 
 Welcome home. 
 Manson : Everything's different, but nothing's changed. 
 Where is she? 
 Tell us what you've done with her, Charlie. 
 Or what? 
 [grunting] 
 Easy, tiger. 
 Stop! 
 Want to play, lawyer man? 
 Back up. Back up! 
 Back up. 
 [chuckles] What's your move, boys? 
 [Manson laughs] 
 Well, come on. 
 You got all the juice the world has to offer. 
 Call Dick Nixon. Huh? 
 Ronnie Reagan? 
 Well, here's how it is. 
 I got her. 
 I'm keeping her. 
 'Cause she's just covered in old Hal. 
 Oh, yeah, blood, fingerprints, and all kinds of stuff the cops and D.A.s just love. 
 [chuckles] 
 Manson : And given the high times the three of us shared... 
 I don't think you're gonna break up the best and the brightest, now are you? 
 Emma : You're wrong. 
 I am free. 
 All evidence to the contrary. 
 Sam. 
 I can't be held much longer unless someone's pressing charges. 
 Are they, Detective? 
 Not my case, lucky for you. 
 So that's a no. 
 And I'm emancipated. 
 Thank you for that. 
 And please, thank Daddy for me. 
 You're not going back to that man, are you? 
 [sighs] As fast as I can get there. 
 No, Emma, baby... 
 You can't go five minutes without saying that. 
 What? 
 "Baby." 
 That's the me you want, the baby who wore the clothes you picked, played the games you wanted, said the things you liked. 
 Charlie always said that jail freed his soul. 
 Yeah, he's a real fount of wisdom, that one. 
 He's truth. 
 Everyone who surrenders to him becomes love. 
 Even Daddy. 
 Grace : I'm not the mother you want? 
 Well, you're not the child I want. 
 You're free. 
 So am I. 
 [light jazz music] 
 Mom said you wanted me to come over. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Yeah. 
 I want you to go to a motel and pay cash. 
 Don't let anybody know where you are, not even me. 
 Why? 
 I think I found a way out. 
 It's not everything you want... 
 Dad. 
 Or they want. 
 But look, do you really think that going to prison is gonna stop a war? 
 It can't. It won't. 
 It'll bring attention. More of us will come forward. 
 No. No, no, no. 
 No, they'll bury it. With you. 
 No, I... I don't know if I can stop any of it. 
 But just let me bring you something. 
 Let me bring you an offer, and you just see if you can live with it. 
 Please? 
 You are the most stubborn creature on this earth. 
 Second. 
 No, third. 
 Your mom. 
 Oh, you have no idea. [Chuckles] 
 [knocking on door] 
 Peace, man. 
 I'd kill for it. 
 Don't have to. 
 It comes in bottles. 
 100% legal since 1933. 
 This is my son, Walt. 
 Hey. Yeah. Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Hodiak : Brian Shafe, my... associate. 
 Associate. 
 [chuckles] 
 I'm on the job. 
 Shafe : Undercover. 
 Wow. Dad, you next? 
 Nah, I'm too old to hook. 
 Why do I know your name? 
 Oh, I'm the one who introduced you to Robbie Arthur. 
 Right. Yes. 
 Sorry, he didn't mention you were a cop. 
 Oh, I got to thank him for that. 
 Walt : So you were over there... with him. 
 Yeah. 
 You in the movement? Here? 
 No. 
 If you're a friend of Robbie's, you... 
 Shafe : It's hard for me. 
 I'm not judging; I don't know what you saw, what you know, any of it, but I'm just not there yet. 
 All right. 
 To... 
 America. 
 Whatever that is anymore. 
 [funky music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Charlie did that to you? 
 I fell. 
 He didn't believe you when you told him you had no idea why I was in jail. 
 You know who he's gonna believe? 
 Me when I tell him what you really did. 
 If you were gonna do it, you would have done it. 
 And I would be dead, I guess. 
 We've loved each other, Sadie. 
 I still love you. What happened? 
 What did I do? 
 Sadie : Nothing. 
 But... It doesn't have to be this way with us, with any of us. 
 Yes, it does. 
 Why? 
 Sadie : Because he doesn't love me. 
 He's never loved me. 
 He barely kisses me. 
 I just want him to love me. 
 Well, working out the language and clearing with DOD is gonna take some time. 
 We need some assurance. 
 You have my word. 
 Once we have an agreement, we don't go public. 
 Dishonorable discharge is the best we can do. 
 And immunity from prosecution only extends to the documents we've discussed. 
 Draw up an agreement, get it to me. 
 I'll have Walt sign, hand over the documents, we all get peace with honor. 
 You must have some real juice. 
 Pulling this off came from top of the top. 
 You got naughty photos of somebody in the White House? 
 That'd be illegal. I'm a cop. 
 Shafe : Everything all right? 
 Getting there. 
 I hope. What's up? 
 The scar the judge saw, could it be a wound? 
 Knife fight? 
 Latin male with a criminal record and a knife wound? 
 Good luck narrowing that down. 
 Shafe : Some other operation. 
 Gallbladder? 
 Hold on. 
 So it's a knife wound on the lower right. 
 The judge is looking at him, right? 
 Perp's left side... 
 Shafe : What else could that be? 
 Well, hernia could be either side, but bad news is, they're more common than appendectomies. 
 How much more common? 
 Couldn't be more than 1,000. 
 Charmain, are we under surveillance? 
 Always. 
 I think she likes us. 
 I like your jobs. 
 So would you be free to... 
 Charmain : Yes. 
 Manson : How'd you get out? 
 They had to drop the charges. 
 It was my path. 
 And I'm glad, so glad, because it made me see the world through your eyes, Charlie. 
 We have to forgive each other. 
 Emma : Always. No matter what. 
 And love each other... completely, forever. 
 [Mary groaning] 
 Manson : Mary? 
 You all right there, Mary? 
 [groaning] 
 Are you having contractions? 
 What are you feeling, Mary? 
 Ah, it's coming. It's coming. It's coming. 
 No, no. It's too early, Charlie. 
 Too early for what? 
 Your Family is growing. 
 Come on. 
 All right, Latin males arrested in Crenshaw... hospitals in Crenshaw operating abdominally on same... 
 Zero. 
 Ditto Wilshire. 
 Hodiak. 
 Walt on phone : Dad, I need to see you. 
 What's going on? 
 Walt on phone : Mom's coming too. 
 Coming? 
 To say good-bye. 
 man : ♪ Never mean to take it out on you ♪ 
♪ Life has its problems ♪ 
 Oh, Sam. 
 Walt's in there. You have to do something. 
 Help him. 
 I'll be back here with a court order. 
 man : Our lawyers will have one too. 
 Guess we all know what your word is worth, don't we, Detective? 
 What did you do, Walt? 
 Morty : He came to see me with the documents, which are no longer in my possession, then he made the call to Major Halpert, surrendering. 
 Your son's a hero. 
 Your son is a traitor. 
 History will determine that. 
 No, sir. 
 Halpert : Court-Martial will. 
 Please, just... just... Please. 
 [quietly] Why? 
 Everything I know we're doing over there, that we're not supposed to be doing, that they're lying about, you have no idea. 
 Even Shafe. 
 Soldiers need to know the war we're fighting. 
 We all do. 
 And two, and three. Go. 
 [Mary screaming] 
 Again. 
 Again. Again. 
 [Mary screaming] 
 There's something wrong. 
 It's not the head. It's turned around. 
 Charlie, Charlie, we have to get her to a hospital now. 
 [Mary screams] 
 Shh. 
 Charlie. Charlie! 
 It's okay, baby. It's okay. 
 I can't do this. 
 It's okay. You got this. 
 Mary : No, no, it's too much. 
 It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. 
 Manson : Come here. 
 [Mary groaning] 
 When I met you, I didn't know who I was. 
 You made me... 
 [Mary screaming] 
 [all talking at once] 
 [screaming] 
 He's here! 
 Oh, boy. 
 Mary, our boy. 
 Oh, baby boy. 
 Ah! He's here. 
 Oh, baby. Oh, baby. 
 [laughing] 
 He's not crying. 
 Charlie, he's not crying. 
 Charlie. 
 What's wrong? 
 No. 
 Mary : Let me hold him. 
 Let me hold him. 
 Let... Let me hold him. 
 Mary... Mary... 
 Let me hold him, Charlie. 
 Let me hold him! Let me hold him! 
 [sobbing] Let me hold him. 
 Let me hold... 
 [sobbing] I can't... 
 [Mary sobbing] My baby... 
 My baby... 
 Oh, Charlie. 
 My baby... 
 This was wrong, Charlie. 
 It was wrong. 
 Some things are just meant to go wrong. 
 Like me and your daddy. 
 Way the nickel rolled on that, I would never have chose that, but it led me to you, and you made the Family. 
 And that, I would never change. 
 [babies crying] 
 
 
 
 [indistinct P.A. chatter] 
 Shafe : So what happens now? To Walt? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know anything about... anything, it turns out. 
 [phone rings] 
 I left the... 
 I left your number with switchboard. 
 You mind? 
 Shafe : Yeah? 
 Hey, Charmain. I'm just... 
 What? 
 No, hold on. Hold on. 
 Slow down. 
 No, no. He's right here. 
 We'll check it out. 
 And thanks, Charmain. 
 That's good work. 
 Not a single Latin male in all of L.A. County fits our criminal or medical profile. 
 Which explains your excitement. 
 Shafe : So I had Charmain dig in another direction... 
 Middle Eastern, Italian. 
 Richard Terrio. Age 28. 
 5'9", 160. 
 Hernia operation. St. Joe's six months ago. 
 Multiple arrests for sexual assault, robbery, solicitation. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Yeah. 
 He's our guy. 
 He's our guy. 
 On 30. 
 One, two, three. 
 26, 27, 28... 
 30. 
 [grunts] 
 Ah! 
 [grunting] 
 Freeze! 
 Drop that knife. Drop it! 
 Drop it. [Knife clatters] 
 [grunts] 
 You okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Look. Look at that. 
 [grunting] 
 Hodiak : Anybody else out there? 
 Anybody? 
 Antonio! 
 [grunts] 
 [coughing] 
 Police! Hands in the air. 
 [gunshots] 
 [gunshots] 
 [gunshots] 
 [gunshots] 
 Hodiak : Look who you shot. 
 Look who you shot! 
 Right there. 
 Look who you shot. 
 He needs an ambulance. 
 He's not gonna get one till you drop that gun. 
 Drop it! Now! 
 [gun clatters] 
 Richie! 
 Stay! Stay there! Stay back! 
 [bones snap] 
 [sirens wailing] 
 Oh, the police. 
 [sirens approaching] 
 You ought to get it looked at is all. 
 I looked at it. 
 [scoffs] 
 I mean by someone who actually got an education. 
 Oh, yeah, I forgot, when it comes to blood, you're such a nance. 
 How's he? 
 Hodiak : Oh, you mean that commercial for surgical dressing over there? 
 He'll live. 
 Yeah, but will he play ball? 
 Whatever do you mean? 
 Sammy, come on. Both dead? 
 One in cuffs, one in a choke? 
 [scoffs] 
 I hope you both got the exact same unlikely but stirring... 
 Commissioner. 
 Sir. 
 Hodiak : Turns out there were two. 
 Shafe : Brothers. 
 But only one was involved in the slaying of the judge's wife. 
 We think both were guilty for Novo, though. 
 Which would more easily explain the crucifixion. 
 Both suspects have to die? 
 Shafe : They did. 
 Yes. 
 Why is that, officer? 
 Sir, we didn't stab ourselves. 
 We didn't put the bullets in Terrio or the walls, the brother did... 
 The answer is no. 
 Sir. 
 I used Terrio as a decoy. 
 I wanted him to get shot by whoever was in that house if they were armed because I didn't want us to get shot. 
 And the brother? 
 No, he didn't have to die. 
 I wanted him to die. 
 I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen now. 
 You will both be receiving the Medal of Valor. 
 Officer, due to the undercover nature of your work, you'll be receiving yours behind closed doors, but you'll get yours from me... 
 To the cheers of a grateful city. 
 Raymond Novo. A judge's wife. 
 Innuendo. Ew. 
 Filth that would have come up in this trial. 
 These weren't homo killings. 
 They weren't swinger killings. 
 They were... killings. 
 In Los Angeles, we close killings. 
 You closed these. 
 For good. 
 [knock on door] 
 Go away. 
 [knock on door] 
 Not answering. 
 Grace : Sam? 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I saw in the paper... they arrested your son. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 God, Sam, I'm... 
 Look, just forget everything. 
 Please, if you need anything... 
 Money for his defense or... 
 No. 
 Thank you, but I'm fine. 
 Well, I'd like to do something right for someone. 
 Me too. 
 Then... let's try. 
 I'm sick of lying about what I am, who I love. 
 [phones ringing] 
 Charmain. 
 Thanks again for your help. 
 It might not be a medal, but I'm gonna bake you one hell of a cake. 
 Anything else you need help with? 
 I am very available. 
 Guapo, the funeral home. 
 We need a list of every... 
 No, I already made a list. 
 Three funeral homes in the county could be a potential match for the hearse. 
 All right, give me the list and I'll see if I can't connect them to Guapo. 
 I checked. No paper connection. 
 You know, I could dress up as a grieving daughter, pretend... 
 And what? Poke around? 
 See if you find the drugs? 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 Look, you want everything at once, right this second. 
 I know the feeling. Okay? 
 But trust me, fight it. 
 You'll get stabbed less. 
 Just give me the list, and I'll go over it while I'm baking your cake. 
 Okay. 
 Sadie. 
 What's going on? 
 Whose is it? 
 It's ours. 
 But how? 
 Where'd it come from? 
 From God. 
 My holy Father. 
 He taketh and giveth. 
 [baby crying] 
 Tonight the big night? 
 Hope so. 
 Or I wore my girdle for no reason. 
 Heard you got yours in Lieu's office. 
 Yep. 
 Is it heavy? Looks heavy. 
 Lot of ribbon. 
 Not... I don't know. Yeah, it's nice. 
 Just maybe a little corny? 
 I like corny. 
 But you don't. 
 No. 
 You know, you don't have to do the job the way I do it. 
 In fact, you shouldn't. 
 You're doing fine. 
 Thanks. 
 [sighs] 
 This is it, by the way. 
 What's that? 
 As nice as I get. This is the apex. 
 This? 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Woop. Moment passed.

 Charmain : All I did was pose as a grieving sister. 
 I told them my brother had just died over there and said I'd heard they were particularly good with deceased veterans. 
 He said, yes, that was true, but things were very busy right now, and he wasn't sure if he could help me.
