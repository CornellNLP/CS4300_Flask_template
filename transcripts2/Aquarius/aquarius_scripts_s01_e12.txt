 Charlie. 
 Hey, Safari Jack. 
 Oh, good to see you. Thanks for having us back. 
 You blew my mind last time. 
 It took me a little while to... ha... put it all together. 
 You know, I wanted to talk to you. 
 You know, this thing you got going on out here... it... it's bigger than songs, you know? 
 It's a worldview, you know? 
 It's rapping, philosophy. 
 It's love, freedom. [Laughs] 
 Amen! Amen, man. 
 It's everything I hear everyone talking about now, but in one place. 
 Out here in... [laughs] in nowhere hills, and all because of you. 
 Ah, I didn't do nothin', man. 
 I'm shy. [Chuckles] 
 I tell you, though... what I did do, though. 
 See, I didn't like the part I was playin', so I changed it. 
 Maybe that made some other people strong in thinking they could do it too, but... that's what. 
 That's what I want to show with the movie, you doing your thing... you know, the music too, but all this here... lay it out for people. 
 They need to know what's happening, man, know what's possible. 
 All right, Jack, yeah. 
 All right, far out! Um... 
 No time like the present, right? 
 You know, we, uh... 
 The slowest is always the leader, right? 
 'Cause he sets the pace. 
 Morning. You're here early. 
 Yeah, I'm here on important police business. 
 I have to descale the coffee pot. 
 It's never been descaled before, but suddenly Detective Whalen has a wild hair up his ass about calcium deposits affecting the taste, so... 
 Course, now it's an emergency. 
 Well, when you're done with that, can you help me? 
 I can help you now. 
 Great. 
 Need to know who in this city uses formaldehyde and for what. 
 Formaldehyde as in embalming fluid? 
 A funeral home, morgue. 
 Right, but where else? You know, factories, warehouses. 
 Anywhere to keep things and move them in and out on the QT. 
 Well, I know they use formaldehyde in particle board, fiberboard. 
 Exactly what I mean. 
 Anything you can find like that. 
 Okay, got it. 
 Cover for me if anyone asks. 
 Course. 
 And don't worry about Whalen. 
 I'll get someone else to descale the coffee pot. 
 Or you could just tell him I did it. 
 I guarantee he won't notice. 
 [soft whirring] 
 woman : Then we lived on a commune on this farm in New Mexico. 
 That's how come I know how to do stuff like build fire pits and cook oatmeal for a whole lot of people at once. 
 Hillman : Sounds great. 
 Yeah. 
 But this one day... 
 I was sitting in front of our building crying, and... this guy came up on a motorcycle and asked if I wanted to go get doughnuts. 
 And that was Charlie. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, my gosh, like a dream. 
 Is Minnie done? 
 Is it my turn? 
 I want you to tell me what happened in that police station. 
 I did, Charlie. 
 Tell me again. 
 They said Emma wasn't there. 
 Just like that? Just... stonewalled a pretty girl like you, huh? 
 Who'd you tell 'em you were? 
 [chuckles] Her sister. 
 They asked you why you thought she was there, what she'd done? 
 So pretty little you walks in there, butter wouldn't melt, tell 'em you think they have your sister, and they don't ask why or what for? 
 They just send you on your way. 
 I don't know what they were doing, Charlie. 
 They didn't tell me. They wouldn't tell me anything. 
 Go find Janet. 
 It's her turn to tell a story. 
 officer : Detective Hudzik around? 
 Not Hudzik. Hodiak. Detective Hodiak. 
 I'm not talking anymore to anyone till I see him. 
 Just keep your hair on. 
 I was worried you might not remember me. 
 Oh, stop. 
 Of all the people I've ever met wearing paint instead of clothes, you were by far the most polite. 
 Now, I don't know if you know this, but first time offense marijuana possession comes with an automatic one to ten-year stretch. 
 I'm betting you do know that this is not your first offense, though. 
 Yeah. 
 But prison... 
 Okay, I hear you. 
 So why don't you tell me this thing you think is gonna help me so much. 
 These bikers... they work for Lucille. 
 I saw them move a body... this guy Jimmy Boots. 
 They put him in the trunk of a gray station wagon. 
 Was Lucille there? 
 No, just... a biker named Roy. 
 He's like their captain, and one called Joker. 
 I think Lucille knows. 
 She said Jimmy moved back East, that he missed the seasons changing. 
 And that's murder, or at least, like, some kind of conspiracy to cover one up, isn't it? 
 I can tell you everything I saw. 
 The station wagon... it had curtains in the back window, and the license plate starts with A5. 
 I tried to see more, but Roy's legs were in the way. 
 All right. All right, well, I'm gonna stop you right there, Rachel. 
 This is all very helpful. 
 I just can't do anything about it right now. 
 What does that mean? 
 What, I'm a snitch for nothing? 
 Not nothing. I'm gonna reduce your charges to misdemeanor loitering after you write all this down for me. 
 I don't understand. 
 You're not going to prison, Rachel. 
 Concentrate on that while I find you a pen. 
 Thank you. 
 So, formaldehyde found in durable press fabrics like drapes, carpets, photography labs in the stabilizer, biology labs, anywhere specimens are being preserved. 
 Automotive... it's used in brake shoes, axles, and it's also a precursor in paints and explosives. 
 Okay, she saw... 
 Roy and a sidekick pack Jimmy Too into the trunk of a long, gray station wagon with curtains in the back, also known as a... 
 Hearse. 
 Hearse. Yes. 
 So that smell of formaldehyde, that was from the funeral parlor. 
 Which is the very first thing I said when you asked me. 
 So, what's next? 
 They call them the bone saw. 
 I know. I'm prepared. 
 I don't know if I mentioned that... bone saw? 
 I'm prepared. Yes. 
 Okay. Well, then, you should go look for a gray Cadillac or Pontiac hearse. with an A and a 5 in the plate. 
 That's what's next for you. 
 Okay. 
 Bone saw. 
 Yes, I know. 
 You don't know where to go. 
 Lucille's a silent partner in five motels around here. 
 Sitting here trying to remember which. 
 It's just... 
 She'll be looking for me. 
 I didn't show up for work, and I just... 
 That woman is a bloodhound. 
 It's times like this I wish I spoke to my sister. 
 She's Orthodox. 
 We're Jewish. 
 [laughs] I mean, I'm not. 
 Wow... 
 You really went all out on the interior decoration. 
 Uh... thank you. 
 You take the bedroom, and I'll take the couch. 
 Gentleman. 
 I try.

 Rachel? 
 I had a hard day. 
 I think you should help me feel better.

 Mm... look... 
 You... you don't have to do this. 
 [laughs] Don't be stupid. 
 Am I acting like a girl who thinks she has to? 
 [groans] 
 [muttering, laughs] 
 You're spinning. [Laughs] 
 Just... just two hours ago, you were outside of a police station crying. 
 And now you think you gotta give me something back, and you don't. 
 Well, maybe I just wanna have some fun. 
 Or maybe you've had enough fun for one day. 
 Yeah, I know you're a grown-up. 
 But you're also involved with Lucille, her dead husband, and a dead mobster, and that doesn't feel right to you, because... underneath it all, you're just a nice Jewish girl. 
 So go back to the bedroom, go to sleep. 
 I will still help you in the morning. 
 Because underneath it all, I'm just a nice half-Jewish guy. 
 I'm not spinning. 
 I'm getting my life together. 
 I know. 
 So when all this blows over, you and I are revisiting this fun you just left on the table. 
 [groans] 
 You promise I'm gonna be okay? 
 I promise. 
 Wait, wait. 
 Come here. 
 Ah... just friends. 
 [giggles] 
 [whispers] Sleep. 
 Goodnight, Rachel. 
 Hodiak, I need your help. 
 With What? 
 Our queer killer case. 
 You mean Cutler's queer killer case? 
 I don't have a queer killer case, because Raymond Novo was no homo. 
 He's a movie star, remember? 
 And you're not a detective. 
 Remember? 
 Okay, well... both Chris Wagner and Raymond Novo brought their killers to places they felt safe... 
 Wagner to his home, Novo to his home away from home. 
 They were both robbed and tortured before they were killed. 
 And except for how Novo wasn't, they were both gay. 
 So we got a case? 
 Well, maybe he wasn't a killer right off the bat. 
 Maybe he went too far once, found that he liked it, kept going. 
 Exactly. That's why... fluttered my eyelashes at that file clerk upstairs... 
 The heartbreak of psoriasis? 
 That's the one. 
 She helped me put together every open home invasion robbery where the victim got hurt more than the situation required. 
 There are this many unsolved violent home invasions in our precinct alone? 
 It's like a sign from God saying, "Move to Irvine."

 Katie : I grew up Catholic. 
 Catholic school... like that. 
 I actually wanted to be a nun, but, um... I just couldn't find my way to it. 
 I wanted to make someone happy, you know? 
 But... no one wanted that from me. 
 No one wanted anything I had. 
 Except one person. 
 And when I met him... 
 I never looked back. 
 Shafe : Found it. 
 Older couple on Outpost in August. 
 Husband said they were asleep when the guy broke in, cleaned the place out... jewelry, money, all that. 
 Responding officer found the wife dead in the living room with a skull fracture wearing lingerie he described as "complicated." 
 Go on... 
 Husband had knife slashes all over his chest and arms, was roped to the headboard by the neck. 
 Hmm. 
 Was he naked? 
 He was not. He had socks on. 
 I would like to talk to him. 
 What's his name? 
 Francis Day Murray. 
 [laughing] No, no, no, no. 
 Yeah? Oh... 
 You know him. 
 Yes. 
 No! I don't know him personally, but he's a superior court judge. 
 Although he did hold me in contempt once, so... we have shared a moment. 
 [exhales] 
 [mellow rock playing] 
 ♪ So leave me all alone ♪ 
 Helping my uncle fix bikes. 
 Must have been 12, 13. 
 [chuckles] 
 Then my uncle found Jesus, and he wanted everybody to find Jesus. 
 But that... that didn't work for me, man. 
 You know, some of the girls, they say they, uh, believe Charlie's like Jesus. 
 No, we don't believe he is. 
 Charlie is Jesus. 
 He's Jesus Christ our Lord. I saw him. 
 Saw what? 
 Water. 
 He walked... on it. 
 Roy : Ha ha, all right. 
 You've had enough, little lady. 
 I hate you, Roy. I... 
 I'm gonna be honest here. 
 It's been tough lately. 
 There's a bad energy, very dark ever since Cherry Pop. 
 What happened to Cherry Pop? 
 I think... we need to go skinny-dipping. 
 [both chuckling] 
 Come on. 
 I got a call asking me to come down, look at some photographs, identify someone? 
 I know you. 
 What is this? 
 I... I called you. 
 Okay? I'm Officer Shafe. 
 Oh, isn't this just rich? 
 I'll give it to you. 
 You do Babe in the Woods pretty well... you fooled me. 
 I'm sorry, okay? I was there to do a job. 
 Well, I don't remember anybody getting arrested or anything that night, so... 
 Do you remember Chris Wagner? 
 He was nice. Was he a friend of yours? 
 Because he left with someone who killed him. 
 Look, I won't lie... I did not wanna be in your place that night, but I was. 
 I was right there in that room, and it happened anyway. 
 You think I feel good about that? 
 You left before Chris did. 
 You couldn't have seen anyone, so... 
 W... why am I here? 
 You said you need me to make an I.D. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Come with me. 
 Uh, Frank, you remember Sam Hodiak. 
 Sure. 
 Thank you for coming in, your honor. 
 Oh, my pleasure. Al here said you might have a lead on the man who killed Lillian. 
 Well, I've been reading up on the case file because we've caught a couple similar cases recently, so... 
 Have you? 
 Yeah, does that surprise you? 
 Surprise? No. 
 I just hadn't heard anything about it. 
 Well, it's a fairly recently development, otherwise, I'm sure you would have been brought up to speed. 
 I mean, unless... 
 Unless... what? 
 Unless they were too embarrassed to... 
 You know, there's fresh coffee. 
 I'm gonna grab a cup. Can I get you... 
 I'll get you a cup. I'll get you one. 
 Lou? 
 No, thanks, Sam. 
 All right. I'll be right back. 
 Lee : Not in the bar. 
 He never came in the bar, but... definitely in the neighborhood. 
 Especially on the weekends. 
 Driving around slow, looking to catch an eye. 
 In a real cherry car, too. 
 A jaguar. 
 Probably didn't hurt his chances. 
 Did you ever see anybody get into the car? 
 Of course. Come on. 
 Suddenly you care about us too? 
 I know. What's next, Rock Hudson going public? 
 I'll walk you out. 
 Hodiak : Okay, what was I saying? 
 You know, 'cause... cops are not always the most subtle of creatures, so, you know... 
 Thank you. 
 Whoever might've, uh... usually brought this up to you might not have known how to tell you, because they respect you. 
 Bring what up? 
 You know... for me, I feel like we all march to the beat of a different drummer with this stuff, you know? 
 I mean, if this job teaches you anything, it's that. 
 Wanna get to the point, son? 
 Well... for all I know, it was your wife's idea... for you to go out and get guys for her, for you to watch... for the both of you, even. Who knows? 
 How dare you. 
 I don't know what to say to you right now, Al. 
 But Detective, by tomorrow, you'll be directing traffic in Hollenbeck Division. 
 I hope it was worth it. 
 Will it be worth it to you when this all comes out anyway and it drags your name through the dirt... and Lillian's? When it turns out you could have helped me right here, right now? 
 And whatever you tell me, I will say I found out some other way. 
 And if this guy goes down for some other murders and not your wife's, for a man like you that served justice his entire life, isn't that a damn sight better than him not going down at all? 
 Now, I do not care what you and your wife got into. 
 In fact, honestly, I think it's great that you found each other. 
 Kindred spirits. 
 Personally... 
 I would give anything for that myself. 
 And if I were you, I would avenge her. 
 Hispanic. 
 Mexican, maybe. 
 In his 20s. 
 Average height, average build. 
 On his, uh... lower abdomen he had an appendectomy scar. 
 I made a comment about it, a joke, and so he gave me some scars of my own. 
 Thank you. 
 Hillman : Charlie. 
 Charlie. 
 Huh? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Just now Katie and Roy were talking about Cherry. 
 Something happen to her? 
 Ah... she was betrayed by the world, my man. 
 Same thing that happened to us all. 
 Besides... why dream of a cherry when you got peaches and plums dangling low everywhere you look? 
 [chuckling] 
 
 
 
 [muffled music] 
 [chatter, laughter] 
 Sam! 
 Come on, join the fun. 
 Mmm... You know, Bernard, He just got back from... 
 Wait. Where was it, Bernie? 
 Turkey? Anyway, he brought this far out purple hashish you gotta come try. 
 Bernie, is it? 
 Is that your drug paraphernalia that you brought over international borders? 
 Groovy. 
 Rachel happen to mention I was a cop? 
 No? 
 It's true. 
 Have a nice night. 
 If you want me to go, I'll go. 
 No, no. I want you to start acting as smart as you are. 
 Why do you care? 
 Because you think this town was just built to throw cash and fun at your pretty face, but it will rape you and stab you and disappear you. 
 You tell me that you want to change because you think that's what I wanna hear, and it is, it's true. But that's because I'd rather not land your case, Rachel. 
 I'd rather you started using your brains and protecting yourself. 
 Or you could protect me. 
 Instead of doing nothing about Jimmy Too. 
 It's a complicated investigation. 
 Doesn't mean you're in hiding, though. 
 You can go back. 
 I haven't been to work in days. 
 Lucille will know something's not right. 
 Ah, well... you just tell her the truth, that you met a handsome, slightly older man who swept you off your feet and then left town. 
 b*st*rd. 
 [laughs] 
 She'll look into it. 
 Next idea. 
 I know what to do. 
 What? 
 Punch me. In the face. 
 No. I... I... 
 I'll say I was robbed. 
 No, that's not gonna work. 
 Knocked out. 
 No, you're not listening to me. 
 I'll say I was in the hospital. 
 Sam... do it. 
 It won't work. 
 I've got a better idea, all right? 
 I will do it... my way. 
 He's coming by around 11:00 after the budget meeting. 
 Could you pass that on to the Lieutenant? 
 Hey, Lou. 
 You look a little, uh... you know, end of a long, hard march. 
 Yeah. It was a night. 
 I don't want to get into it. 
 Need a little hair of what bit ya. 
 Isle of Sky Special Reserve? 
 You wanna give that to me? 
 I want you to share it. 
 You and me, babe. 
 Just take a little sniff. 
 Priore : No, no, no! [Cutler laughing] 
 No! She said no! 
 [laughing] 
 I got a... I got the photograph here I want you to see. 
 I just... this one is beautiful.

 Good to hear.

 Hey, I want you to know that everything that's happened... 
 I haven't been myself. 
 I was worried about the wrong things, and I got confused. 
 But I'm not confused about you, Sam. 
 [door opens] 
 You got me here. 
 Middle of the day. 
 I don't know if you know this, but my son, who's in Vietnam, is not in Vietnam. 
 He's here, and he's in some trouble that I can't fix. 
 He's AWOL, and... you want what from me? 
 Your connections, someone high up enough to grant immunity in exchange for classified documents detailing illegal actions by the U.S. government. 
 And quickly, because Walt wants to go to the press. 
 So... he's a radical? 
 Mm... I don't think he is. 
 I think being over there did something to him. 
 To his mind. 
 Come on, Sam. 
 You've accused me, you've threatened me, you've... you've slept with my wife in my own house, and now you want... 
 Make a trade. 
 Trade? 
 Let's talk about a prostitute that disappeared seven years ago. 
 Now let's talk about her friend who reported her missing and the things she might know. 
 I don't know what they are. 
 But I know her name, her real name. 
 And I know where she lives. 
 It's a house in Riverside. 
 Costs way more than a woman in her position could ever scrape together to afford. 
 Someone paid her to be quiet. 
 She filed that missing persons report anyway because she just didn't want to see this girl go forgotten. 
 If you're so sure she knows something, why haven't you... 
 So I could stand here with you and sell the last shred of my soul to keep my son safe. 
 If I speak to this woman, I will have to formally investigate anything she tells me. 
 But if you agree to help my son, I won't say word one to her. 
 And we all go on with our lives. 
 Such as they are. 
 Fine. It's a deal. 
 I'll call my friend at the DOD now. 
 Manson : So you talked to Sadie? 
 Roy : Yeah, I did. 
 Mm. You believe her? 
 I don't like to believe, man. 
 I like to find out, you know? 
 'Course, there's no finding out with Sadie anyway, really, right? I even tried to tell her, Maybe things'll be better with Cherry gone, that she was pretty heavy... maybe we'd better off if the Man took her on down the road for us. 
 What did Sadie think about that? 
 And what did old Sadie Mae think about that? 
 She said, "There are no questions in the world, Roy. 
 "A question is just a statement that tells me what you're really thinking." 
 [laughs] 
 She kinda reminded me of you. 
 [distant crowd chatter] 
 There you are. 
 Yeah, I was just thinking it wouldn't take that much money for us to... 
 What did you do to Cherry? 
 What? Nothing, Charlie. 
 You for sure made a big song and dance about her. 
 We all saw that. 
 Because I'm sad. 
 Because you're lying! 
 No. 
 Because anything I do, everything I am, is for you, Charlie. 
 Why is it a bad thing, huh, to love you? 
 To be your wife, your child, your lieutenant? 
 You used to call me... 
 Do not make me do it again! 
 And what did you do to that girl? 
 [laughing] 
 That sweet, sweet girl. 
 Your favorite girl. 
 That perfect girl...

 What is wrong with you? 
 Mmm... you're the one.

 I can see it in your eyes. 
 You're not mine. 
 You're your own. You do what you want. 
 Mmm. I love you. 
 I love you, Charlie. 
 You had her taken. 
 You fed her to the Man. 
 Emma, who never did nothing to you but be smarter and better! 
 No. I loved Cherry like my own sister. 
 I want you to cleanse the evil from your soul. 
 I want you to pray for light. 
 Heavenly Father, I humbly beseech you, please forgive me for my sins.

 Please forgive me.

 Yes.

 God, I hope so. 
 Then we're gonna make the most of it. 
 You okay? 
 I heard... 
 Accident. 
 I'll get a broom. 
 Can I get you anything else? 
 No. 
 Thanks. 
 You drunk? 
 Hey, easy. 
 Hey, hey... 
 I have an idea. 
 Just wait a minute. 
 I have an idea. Just get out of my way. 
 I can't let you drive, Sam. 
 Relax. 
 You're a child, a baby. 
 Yeah, well, you're drunk and a lunatic... 
 Just... 
 You know, I been watching you unravel slow for a while, Sam, but you're picking up speed. 
 So just take a breath, Detective. 
 No, no, I get it, okay? 
 Things are bad at home and everything, but this isn't home. 
 I do my job. 
 Crack skulls on a dime? 
 What are you, my mother? 
 I'm your friend. 
 You're not my friend. I don't even like you and your stupid hair. 
 Yeah, well, I don't like you either, you prick. Nobody likes the guy who comes in like they're the only one with troubles. 
 Nobody... 
 Oh, what troubles do you have? 
 You married the most beautiful woman that ever looked your way, and you want points for sainthood because your perfect, healthy baby and wife are colored? 
 Does it ever get boring being better than everybody else? 
 Okay, yeah, say what you want, but this is about you. 
 Yeah, I'm done, huh? 
 You do what you want. 
 You wanna kill yourself? Kill yourself. 
 I don't care. I'll call you a black and white. 
 Hal, what the... 
 I need your help, Ken. 
 It happened again. 
 [Hal sobbing]
