 Alex! First day of camp, bro.

 Remember that time you woke up 'cause you thought there was a leak, and it was actually Mark Peperall's pee soaking through the sheets 'cause he got scared after watching "Poltergeist" and we kept going "They're here"?

 Yes, Jason. I remember. 
 I told you. It's Blotter now.

 Okay.
