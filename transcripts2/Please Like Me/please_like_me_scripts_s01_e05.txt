 Josh, I have a surprise for you today. 
 Oh, no! 
 Josh, don't be like that, please. 
 Geoffrey's got something really nice planned for you. 
 You need to be grateful, alright? 
 I'm scared. I'm scared of surprises. 
 I have an afternoon planned for us. You'll like it. 
 If he doesn't want to go, you can take me. 
 That's creepy. You're getting creepier every day. More and more creepy. 
 Best be off. 
 (KISSES AND GROWLS) 
 Thank God he's not staying for breakfast. 
 I don't like soy! 
 Mm-hm. 
 I think I might need to get a new job if we're going to have a kid. 
 No, just... just don't worry about it. 
 Don't worry about it? Kids are expensive. 
 I got a locksmith the other day and it cost $160. 
 Took him, like, five minutes. 
 You don't need a new job. 
 It's like a 6-week course and I think I'd be really good at it. 
 You know, you don't have to come with me today. 
 Our first doctor's appointment? I'm not gonna miss that. 
 Well, it's just... I'll be fine on my own. 
 Are you kidding, Niamh? 
 I'm gonna be there for you every step of the way. 
 This is our baby. 
 I don't want to miss a single second of this experience. 
 This is like the whole point of life. 
 It's a miracle. 
 (SIGHS) 
 What? 
 Is this the hormones? 
 Hey, come on, just please let me drive. You're gonna get in trouble. 
 Oh, what'll they do to me? 
 Take away my license again? 
 Send me to prison? 
 I've only got a few good months left anyway. 
 Josh, are you sure we're doing enough for your 21st? 
 Perhaps we could get a hall or something. 
 Yes, please, I told you. I don't want a party. 
 Well, you're gonna get a party! 
 We don't need a fricking hall. I only have two friends and Geoffrey. 
 I just want it to be special, that's all. Your 21st's a big deal. 
 You bought me this piñata, ok? It's already heaps special, special enough. 
 Have you invited your father? You should invite your father. 
 No, we don't need to. I'll just see him another day. 
 Oh no, Josh, I'm fine. Invite him. 
 No, really, I'm fine. Look, he can bring a date. 
 Has he got a girlfriend? 
 I don't know. 
 Wouldn't know if he has a girlfriend. 
 You said that like you were lying. 
 Ok, fine, he has a girlfriend. 
 But he doesn't want me to tell you about it, ok? 
 Why doesn't he want me to know about it? 
 I don't know. I guess he thinks it'll upset you, you know? 
 He leaves her at the corner store every time he comes to visit. 
 He hides her from you. It's pretty ridiculous. 
 Yeah, he's a ridiculous man. 
 Yeah. 
 Anyone want a strawberry? 
 So, what's her name? 
 Mae. 
 Oh. 
 Mae? 
 Come on, stop crying. 
 You knew he'd have to move on one day. 
 Anyway... (CHIRPS) you've got Rod! 
 Oh, Rod is disgusting. 
 He really is disgusting. 
 And why would that freaking jerk think that I couldn't handle this news, hmm? 
 Josh, would you pass me my CD? 
 It's in. 
 Ah, good. 
 We'll have a singalong. 
 Yes!

 (CAR DOORS CLOSE) 
 Alan. 
 Hello, Rose. 
 Thank you so much for coming to help out today. 
 I really appreciate it. It's very generous of you. 
 Shall we get started? 
 Open for inspection! 
 Right. 
 Right. 
 So, where do we start, then? 
 Should I vacuum? 
 Jesus, when's the last time you vacuumed? 
 I'm depressed. I don't vacuum. 
 Don't look at me. 
 We're in the same family. We all have the same habits. 
 I'll vacuum. 
 No, please. You really don't need to vacuum. 
 And you won't have time if you're gonna make the game. 
 What game? 
 Rose, it was meant to be a surprise. 
 He really doesn't like surprises, Geoffrey. 
 What game? 
 Collingwood v St Kilda. Members Stand. 
 Oh, no, not AFL. I don't like it. You know I don't. 
 I don't understand how it works. 
 I'll teach you. 
 No, I don't want to watch sport and do learning. That's not a fun day. 
 What about Claire's '70s-themed dinner party? 
 I'm really excited about that... 
 We will be there on time, Josh. 
 Can't you just take someone else? I'll ruin the fun for you. 
 Can't you just find a real boy? 
 Or you can stay here and help us. 
 My advice is take the football. 
 Alan! Alan, can you come here, please? 
 I've got a job for you outside while I've got a real man here. Ok, come on. 
 Now, I think this would look much better in the backyard. 
 Ah, Rose, there's no way. There's just no way. 
 No, you just have to dig it up. I'll help you carry it round the back. 
 There's no way. 
 No, come on. 
 I really need this done. I don't have anybody here to help me do it. 
 Rose, it's not possible. 
 Ok, fine. Forget it, then. 
 Let's just go down to the corner store for some chocolate milk, shall we? 
 Oh, Rose, I don't think we've got time to go down to the... 
 Uh, what are you doing? We don't have time for milk. 
 I just want some delicious milk. 
 What are you doing? 
 I know about her, ok? I know. 
 I know she's waiting down at the corner store. Josh said. 
 Oh, for f*ck's sake. Why would he do that? 
 Why the f*ck does that matter? He told me because it came up. 
 Ok, yes, yes, you're right. 
 Anyway, I've decided I'm not angry about it. 
 I've moved on anyway. I'm happy for you. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, anyway, look, about this tree. 
 Hey, Ma. Me and Geoffrey are going out to the football, alright? 
 But you hate sport. 
 Yeah, so much. I hate it so much. 
 Bye. 
 Alright, Alan. Now, I am going into the kitchen to do some tidying up. 
 I'm going to leave you with this tree. 
 Rose... 
 So... what's she like, then? 
 Who? 
 Mee. 
 Mae. 
 Yeah, just tell me about her. I want us to be friends. 
 Then I can tell you about Rod. 
 Who's Rod? 
 A man I'm seeing. 
 That's good. 
 Yeah, so where did you meet her? 
 On a plane. 
 Oh, that's good. 
 She's from Thailand. 
 And she came all the way out here for you? 
 Yeah. 
 She mustn't have very good eyesight. 
 They don't all have bad eyesight, Rose. 
 What? Oh, Alan, no, not because she's Asian! 
 Oh, no, I was making a joke about you, about how you look. 
 I was joking about how she came all the way out here for you and you look like, ugh, that. 
 Right. That's very funny. 
 Mmm. 
 So tell me about Rod. 
 Oh, well, he's horrible to talk to but he's incredible in bed. Best I've ever had. 
 (CROWD SHOUTS) 
 Go, go, go! 
 Oh, that's useless! 
 (CROWD ROARS) 
 Oh, come on, Pies! 
 I can't find the fifth one. 
 Geoffrey, I can't find the fifth one. 
 The ball! 
 Hey. 
 I'm at the football. 
 Oh, really? What's it like? 
 Tom, I'm so f*cking bored. 
 Geoffrey keeps yelling things that I can't understand. 
 How did he talk you into this? 
 I'm making compromises, ok? Apparently it's good to compromise. 
 You never compromise. 
 Yeah, I know, because then I end up in situations like this. 
 Oh, why did I get back with him? I'm just such a big dope. 
 Uh, 'cause he's pretty, and you were rejected and alone? 
 Yeah. 
 How's your baby? 
 We're at the doctor now. 
 Oh, are you... 
 Are you getting it done? 
 Done? 
 Like you're getting it all, you know... (MAKES SUCKING SOUND) 
 No. We're not getting it... 
 (WHISPERS) we're not getting an abortion. 
 I want to keep it. 
 I've been thinking, and I think one of my favourite things about Geoffrey is that he doesn't have a uterus, you know, 
 'cause it means that we could never get ourselves into this situation. 
 I think it's good for the world there's no risk you could get someone pregnant. 
 (LAUGHS) Yeah. 
 Are you a little bit surprised that your sperm actually works? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Pick up the ball, you idiot. Get on him. On him! 
 Geoffrey, I've decided I want to get involved. I'm ready. 
 Ok, ok. You see this bloke? 
 Yes. 
 Centre half-forward, right? 
 His main role is to move the ball... (YELLS) toward the bloody goal! 
 Don't drop it! 
 You sound angry. Is he bad? Is he a bad one? 
 No, he was best and fairest last year. 
 He's the best one? 
 So I can just yell whatever I like at these people even though they're doing way more than I ever could? 
 He's not doing anything today. 
 (YELLS) You butter-fingered piece of sh1t! 
 What are you gonna do when you get too old to do this? 
 The life of a sportsman is short, and you never got a real education! 
 Pick up the ball, you idiot! 
 What, are your hands still slippery from when you fingered... 
 I was gonna say, "Are your hands still slippery from when you fingered your cousin?" but I couldn't do it. 
 Geoffrey : You fingered your cousin! 
 Geoffrey, have I seen that man's wang on the internet? 
 Yep, that's him. 
 Excuse me, sir, I've seen your wang! 
 That is weak as piss. Bring your husband next time, ya faggot! 
 Faggot! 
 Geoffrey, I don't think you're allowed to say "faggot". 
 
 
 
 Excuse me, boys. 
 You faggot! 
 Excuse me, boys. 
 No, it's ok. I told him. We'll calm down. 
 Mate, I can't allow that kind of homophobic slandering. 
 I think it's time to go. 
 Homophobic? Mate, it's my boyfriend. We're not gonna be homophobic. 
 (CROWD OOHS) 
 It's still time to go, lads. Come on. 
 Why did you say that? 
 What? 
 About Rod and the... you know, the bloody bedroom thing. 
 Are you trying to make me feel bad? 
 It was a joke. 
 Oh. 
 It's not a big deal. I'm sure Mae has moves. 
 Jesus, Rose, do we need to talk more seriously about this? 
 Oh, you seem a bit taken aback. 
 Sorry, is the s*x a sore spot? Is it not great? 
 Communication is the key. I've always found that. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 s*x isn't a sore spot with Rod, I can tell ya. 
 Well, there's... 
 Both : No communication. 
 I'm gonna go. 
 You're angry at me 'cause I kissed you? 
 No, it's nothing like that, I promise. I just wanna go and do my own thing. 
 You're just ashamed of kissing me in public. 
 It's not about you. I just... 
 I don't like it. I don't like all those people looking. It's icky. 
 You just can't handle that you've fallen in love with a guy. 
 Who the f*ck says stuff like that? 
 It sounds like a line from "Degrassi Junior High". 
 You're so afraid to feel things, Josh. 
 It's not about feeling things. 
 Yeah, because you can't. 
 Yes, I can. I can. I can feel things! 
 You know what? I don't... I don't need this. 
 (CROWD ROARS) 
 Claire! What ya up to? 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm done. 
 Oh, you're quitting. What a surprise. 
 Ahh! 
 Oh, sorry, Peg. 
 Rose, I just want you to know that I am genuinely doing the things that I'm doing to try to make this easier for you. 
 What, easy like your mama? 
 Really, Rose? 
 (SIGHS) "Really, Rose?" 
 Can you please be serious? 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 What are you doing? Stop it! Why are you making this so difficult? 
 Easier for me? 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Now, how arrogant, Alan, of you to think that you are in control of making things easier for me. 
 We're divorced, mate. Like, that's it. It's over. You're irrelevant. 
 Now, so why should I be making things easier for you? 
 Stop it! 
 Sorry. Hi. 
 I was knocking for a while. 
 House looks great. 
 Hi. The agent. 
 I'm the aunty. 
 Gonna... sell this house. 
 Good luck. (LAUGHS) 
 No, not those ones. The other ones. 
 These ones? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you think I should be ok with kissing boys in public? 
 Well, you weren't ok with kissing me in public. 
 Exactly. Exactly. 
 It's too much, you know? 
 It's just so... ugh. 
 Ugh! 
 Ok, I have to tell you something but don't tell Tom that I've told you. 
 Ok. 
 No, I mean it. 
 You really, really can't tell him that I've told you. 
 I'm only telling you because I don't have anyone else. 
 Yes, ok, ok. Yes. 
 And don't be mean about it either, please. 
 Yes, fine. What? 
 Um... 
 Tom and I... made out. 
 No! 
 You poor thing. 
 What did he do to you? 
 Nothing, I liked it! We made out twice, actually. 
 Once properly and once briefly. 
 Oh, how did you... how did you find s*x in... in Tom? 
 We didn't have s*x, though. 
 Yes, of course. Ok, obviously of course. 
 Of course you didn't have s*x, obviously. 
 We did make out in the shower, though. 
 He did ejaculate on my thigh. 
 Oh, no, that's too much. Why would you tell me that? 
 You know, this is just... Claire, this is too much for me to handle. 
 Well, I'm only telling you because I have no friends and I have to tell someone about this stuff. 
 Ok, ok. 
 Also... 
 No, there isn't an also. 
 I won't believe that. I can't. I can't believe it. 
 I really liked it. 
 I... I'd like to do it again. 
 A lot. 
 I liked it. I like him. 
 Yeah. Sure, I like him too, you know what I mean? 
 He's a likeable guy. What a likeable chap. 
 Yeah, but I like like him. 
 No! Eugh! 
 Eugh! 
 (LAUGHS) Ok, I get it. 
 Eugh! 
 Can you please just pretend to be sensitive and caring about my feelings, like I know you're actually quite secretly good at? 
 No, I'm not secretly good at it. I'm not. 
 Whatever. 
 Anyway, I just... I really can't wait for him to get rid of Niamh. 
 I just... I can't stand her. 
 She's the worst... person. 
 Hey... 
 I have some f*cked news. 
 What? 
 Uh, they are keeping the baby. 
 I feel a bit weird that I set that news up by saying it was f*cked. 
 I mean, that's good news. That's ok news. 
 They're not gonna... kill a baby. I guess that's good news. 
 That's not the point. It's just bad news for you personally. 
 Because, like, you know, you really like him and maybe he likes you and I just... 
 I just hope that if I keep talking it'll take longer for you to say something that points out how completely heartbreaking this is for you. 
 Ok. 
 Really? Do you want to cancel tonight? We should cancel tonight. 
 No. 
 We can cook at my mum's house. 
 I'll just tell them it was my fault. 
 It's fine. I should just deal with this head on anyway. 
 Yeah? 
 It's stupid. Yes. 
 Ok. 
 Yep. 
 Up, up, up, up! Good boy. 
 So you can see we've got a two-car garage. 
 Big gate, big gate. No-one's getting through that. 
 Substantial front yard, so play sports and whatnot. 
 It's got a very lovely front entrance there with the two trees. 
 Do you want to keep going? I'll give you this brochure. 
 Not really sure what the plan is here. 
 We'll just keep going. 
 Thanks very much. 
 "I... hate... you." 
 (MESSAGE SENT TONE) 
 (MESSAGE RECEIVED TONE) 
 "I... just... wanted... 
 ... to... be... there... 
 ... for... you and Josh. 
 But... " 
 "... I guess Magic Dick Rod has it covered." 
 Ohh! 
 She's Thai, isn't she? 
 Yeah. 
 You should say something about ping-pong. 
 Oh, you're good, Peg. 
 Ohh! (LAUGHS, SNORTS) 
 That's good. 
 "Does... she... " 
 (LAUGHS) This is good! 
 "... do... ping-pong?" 
 Oh, sh1t. No, not "ping-ping". 
 It's bloody... 
 Ohh! This damned auto-correct. 
 How do you... how do you get it to go back? 
 I don't know. 
 (MESSAGE SENT TONE) 
 sh1t! Oh, no, here we go. Ok. 
 "Ping-ping?" 
 (SIGHS) Stupid f*cking sh1t thing! 
 Ping-pong! 
 Go on. There, use that. 
 Hey, guys! So good to see you. 
 Hi. 
 Hope you don't mind. I brought a salad. 
 Oh, well, we're doing a '70s theme, so... whatever. 
 Oh, well, salad's salad. Now we have lots. 
 Yeah, but it's not '70s. 
 How can a salad be '70s, Claire? 
 So we have some news. Niamh is not pregnant. 
 Yeah. I thought I was, but I'm not. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Ah, so how did you find out that you're not? 
 We went to the GP today and had a test. 
 You only just got tested? 
 Well, yeah. My period was late. It's usually like clockwork. 
 I was really getting into the idea of having a little kid too. 
 So I'm sorry, you told everyone that you were pregnant because your period was late? 
 It's just, you know, that sometimes that happens. 
 Sometimes your period is late, isn't it? 
 I think we just got a bit carried away. 
 No, Tom, can you really not see how ridiculous it is to tell people that you're pregnant because your period is late. 
 Did you even take a home test? 
 Well, Niamh says her period's like clockwork. 
 I knew that she'd made it up. Did I not say she'd made it up? 
 She bamboozled you by talking about periods. That's very cunning. 
 Ah, no, no, I didn't. 
 You can get these home tests at the store, Niamh. 
 You don't just tell people you're pregnant without taking a test. 
 You know, I don't understand why you're so upset about this, Claire. 
 I mean, Tom and I are the ones who've lost our baby. 
 Tom and you never had a baby. 
 You lied to him because you thought that he was gonna break up with you, obviously. 
 Ah, no! I thought I was pregnant. 
 TOM AND JOSH: Geoffrey. 
 Josh, I wanna talk to you. 
 Oh, no, no. Not now! 
 Now. 
 Can you guys just maybe do me a favour and stop this fight for a bit, briefly? 
 It's just... I don't want to miss it. 
 No? 
 There's more cheese in the fridge, if anybody wants some... 
 ... wants some cheese. 
 Claire : Tom and I made out. 
 Twice. 
 How could you do this to me? When I was pregnant? 
 You were never pregnant. 
 You thought I was pregnant. 
 It wasn't when you were not pregnant. 
 Well, the first time, but it was actually when we were broken up. 
 And the other time was drunk and it didn't mean anything. 
 You're kidding me. It meant nothing? You were... he was sobbing! 
 No, it just looked like I was sobbing 'cause it was raining. 
 You know, Claire, I was really, really wrong about you. 
 This whole time I thought you were angry because, well, you know, you're a little bit plain, but turns out you're actually just a bitch. 
 We really need to talk about what happened today. 
 No, don't worry about it. I called Claire and we hung out. It's fine. 
 You were dismissive of my emotions. 
 Well, you were the one who walked away. 
 Yeah, I was too hurt to stay. 
 Can't this wait? 
 No, Josh, it can't. 
 Look, this is important to me, ok? 
 I'm supposed to be important to you, so this should be important to you. 
 You know, every time we fight I don't know who to talk to because the only person I want to talk to is my best friend, and you're my best friend. 
 Really? 
 Look, I know I can be annoying at times, but it's part of who I am, ok? 
 And I want to give you all of me, the best parts and the worst. 
 Why do I have to put up with the worst parts? 
 That's what I want from you too, ok? All of you. 
 I don't care what comes with that. 
 How could you do this to me? 
 Home wreckers. 
 Your home is made of lies. 
 Tom loves me. 
 Oh, really? 
 That's not the impression I got when I was in the shower with him. 
 Look, this is... this fighting is very flattering. 
 I just think maybe we could stop now. 
 You stole my man. 
 But we... we were broken up at the time. The first time. 
 I'm not threatened. I mean, Tom couldn't like you. 
 I mean, heterosexual boys never like you. 
 Do they, Claire? 
 Ha! 
 Tom? 
 (WHISPERS) Yep? 
 You coming? 
 Well, I don't know. I was thinking... I'm just not sure what... 
 Tom, what the f*ck are you talking about? Of course you're picking me. 
 Yeah, I am. I'm just gonna stay here if that's cool. 
 Thanks. She's quite right. 
 Ok. 
 Alan : I'm sorry that it had to end like this. 
 f*ck you. Look, we should have separated years ago, Alan. 
 I didn't want to leave you alone. 
 Oh! I'm not alone, Alan. I'm fine. 
 Ah, hi. We're all done for the day, so I'll call you later and tell you how it went. 
 Yeah, good. Thanks. Thank you. 
 Ok, Peg, there's no more beer. We've gotta go inside. 
 Come on, show's over. 
 Peg? 
 Stay. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 (DOG BARKS) 
 Look, I don't understand why out of everyone you're the person I have to try the hardest to impress. 
 What do you think? Can we just... 
 Can we give this... give us a better shot? 
 (PHONE VIBRATES) 
 Geoffrey, I just... 
 Nah. 
 No. 
 I'm sorry.
