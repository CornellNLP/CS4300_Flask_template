 BARBIE: Two weeks ago, an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world. 
 Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead, we still don't know. 
 Every day it tests our limits, bringing out the best and the worst in us. 
 Some say we'll be stuck here forever, but we will never stop fighting to find a way out. Chester's Mill sentences Dale Barbara to death. The egg... it's doing something. JOE: This has to be the way the dome picks a new leader. She's your monarch. Big Jim, you're a sick b*st*rd. JOE: The butterfly makes some kind of spot. JUNIOR: Why is it getting dark in the middle of the day? BIG JIM: My wife, Pauline, before she passed, "The pink stars are falling." JULIA: Our whole town is as good as dead if we let this fall into the wrong hands. JOE: How do we protect Chester's Mill and save Barbie? JULIA: We can't. JUNIOR: Dad, what's happening? Now, son, do it now! Now, Junior! (Rumbling) (Electrical buzzing and hissing) (Rumbling) (High-pitched tone sounding) (Rumbling) (Panting): Dad? What's happening? (High-pitched tone sounds) What's that sound? (High-pitched tone sounds) Pull the lever, son. (Panting) Do it, Junior! Do it now! I'm afraid. (High-pitched tone sounds) (Water splashing, woman screaming) (Gasps) (Woman gasping and shrieking) (Woman screams) (High-pitched tone sounds) What the hell is that? Look! (Bell clangs) (Wood clattering) Look out! Move! (Groaning) (High-pitched tone sounds) (Sighs) Linda, what's happening? They're unconscious but still breathing. Jim, let me help. What, set you free? There are people out there, your people, that need help. Nice try, Barbie. Do it, son. No, Junior, Junior, look out there. The sound is making people sick. We need to stop it. (Panting) I can't do it. What are you doing? I think the dome's trying to tell us something. That's nonsense. We should go there. It could have answers for what's happening. The dome doesn't have answers. Yes, it does, Dad. The dome is more than you think it is. It's shown me things. If you're too scared to do it, I'll do it. Look out. Stop. What are you doing, Linda? I'm being reasonable. After what I've seen, I think maybe Junior's right. We'd need to take a trip to the dome before we do something we're all going to regret. (Grunting) (Gasping and grunting) (Panting) Come on. (Rhythmic panting) Come on. (Gasps) What happened? I don't know. She was drowning in the lake. (Rhythmic breathing) She just appeared. I have no idea where she came from. (Loud panting) Here, let me try. (Loud breath) (Loud breath) (Coughing and gasping) It's a good thing you were here. I saw strange lights coming out of the lake. We got to get her and you dry. Can you walk? Uh, if it's not too far. It's just through the woods. (Sighs) What the hell?! It's magnetic. Whoa! (Groans, gasps) (Grunting) LINDA: What's happening? Ah... Ah, Linda... LINDA: Barbie! Oh! My cuffs! (Grunts) Hold on! I got you! (Grunting) Help me! Help! Hurry! I can't. Junior! Help me! Help! (Both shout) (Panting) Okay. Come on. (Linda groans) Linda! Linda, get out of here. (Grunts) Get out of here! Barbie, I can't. I almost got it, hold on. Linda! Get out of the way, Linda! Almost... almost... (Grunts) Get out of the way! Linda, run! Run! Go! Linda! No! Sweetheart, can you tell me your name? How did you end up in the lake? I don't think she can hear me. She's in shock. Best thing for her is rest. We don't even know who she is. (Hisses) Right now I'd say you've got problems of your own. Better let me check it out. JULIA: Okay. Well... looks like the stitches must've come loose in the lake. Who sewed you up? A... friend who was here. Was? Yeah, I had to leave him. He was protecting me; he didn't make it. (Sighs) Well, you can't be sure. Not of anything, these days. (Hisses) (Exhales) Are you sure you know what you're doing? I'd better. I was an EMT for ten years. In town? Hmm. Thought I knew everyone at the hospital. Turns out the county likes their paramedics sober. I prefer being alone out here. Most of the time, anyway. Sam Verdreaux. Julia Shumway. (Barbie breathing heavily) It should've been me. Junior, you're to blame. If we hadn't come out here, she'd still be alive. Hey! This isn't Junior's fault. Whatever's going on here, we gotta make sure nobody else gets hurt. Well, the best way to do that is finish what we started. Junior, help! Find someone else! You want more blood on your hands by letting that murderer go? BARBIE: Hey! We both know that I didn't kill Dodee or burn down that radio station. So you want to tell him why you framed me? Is that true? I was about to hang an innocent man? That doesn't matter. Linda is dead. Who knows how much of this town's been destroyed by this... magnetic pull? We gotta make sure nobody else gets hurt. Where the hell do you think you're going? (Groaning) Where you going? To find Julia. He was telling the truth, wasn't he? You killed Dodee. She was gonna spread lies about our family that would tear this town apart. You're the one tearing Chester's Mill apart. No, I'm the one with the guts to do what needs to be done! Someone has to make the hard choices! You gonna do it? Linda just did! Who's next, Dad? Maybe it's you. There you go. You know, a lot of people in town could use someone with your skills. Hmm. I'm not too sure they'd be happy to see me. After all this, whatever happened in the past... it doesn't matter anymore. Some things are kind of hard to leave behind. Is that why you're... holed up here? All by yourself? Some things you never get over. Like my sister taking her life nine years ago. (Rumbling) (Racks shotgun) (Sighs) Can I help you with something? Look, I-I'm sorry about your car, all right? This is an emergency. Hey, wait. You're him, aren't you? You're that murderer. I'm not a murderer. (Rumbling) Besides, this town's got bigger problems. The groans are coming more quickly. Are you timing these things? They are getting stronger, like a... a... pregnant woman's contractions. Only instead of giving life, people could die if they don't wake up. You sound awful confident about that. I've been studying the dome since it came down. I think it can manipulate electromagnetic fields and they're interfering with some people's brainwaves. What are you, a nuclear physicist? Nothing so glamorous. I'm a high school science teacher. Rebecca Pine. Dale Barbara. (Distant roar) If the pulses can do this here, no telling what it's doing to people who live by the dome. Joe McAlister. Oh, my God, my mom's in there. Mom... Whoa! Whoa, watch out. She hit her head. Get down! Oh! Let's get her up. Ready? Whoa, look out! Hurry. That door. What do we do? Get the table. Okay. Look out. Oh. (Grunting) Watch your arm. Just get it, get it, just... Okay. Whoa! Whoa! What is happening? It's pulling all the nails out. (Screams) Get it out! Get the nail out of my hand! (Gasping) (Panting) (Metal rustling, squeaking) (Loud rumbling) (Whooshing, rumbling) (Panting) Wait a sec...! (Panting) I think the dome is pulling it through my hand. (Whooshes) (Groans) (Panting) (Panting): Aah! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Here. Here. (Panting, gasping) BARBIE: Joe! In here! Help him. Help him. Come on, hold that. Pull it down, pull it down, Norrie, help. Stove, stove! BARBIE: Two, three! (Overlapping yelling) (Grunting, yelling) Watch out! Come on, go! Get out of here, move! Let's go. Go. Let's go. (Both grunting) Come on, come on! (Panting) 
Hold-hold-hold on. Joe, go! Ready, go. Go! (Panting) Right here. Right here. Right here. (Both panting, grunting) (Panting heavily) WOMAN: Big Jim... Looks like it's just you and me now. (Panting) (Panting): I've been under a lot of stress lately... a lot of stress; that-that-that's all this is, it's just... it's a hallucination brought on by stress, just... (Groans) What's happening out there is your fault. Only, it's the townspeople who are paying. Why wouldn't I have hallucinations? I've been carrying this whole town on my shoulders ever since Dome Day. The dome is ripping Chester's Mill apart! (Deeply inhales, exhales) (Giggles) (Laughs) See you, sweetheart. Go back to the Twilight Zone. I got work to do. (Grunts) (Banging) (Grunting, groaning) Damn it. (Groans) (Squishing) You did this. Ugh. You. And I'm not going anywhere. You're not Dodee. You're not Dodee... you're something else. Junior said the dome talked to him. Showed him things. He warned you about this. Should have listened. (Panting) (Thumps, metal rattles) We have to get my mom to a doctor. Why isn't she waking up? REBECCA: Half the town is like this. It's the pulses. Magnetism like this can cause hallucinations, seizures, unconsciousness... even death. So you're saying, my mom's gonna die? Her vitals are stable. As soon as the pulses subside, she should be fine. Should be? Norrie, we are gonna figure this out. You're sure we're safe here? For now. The pulses are strongest near the dome's perimeter, so the center of town is the zone of least destruction. Okay. All right. So we got to move everyone. To right here... where we are... at the school. (Metal scrapes) The dome's altered the magnetic fields around Chester's Mill before, when all the monarch butterflies were attracted to it, but never to this extent. If the pulses keep getting stronger, they could tear apart the entire town. We need a way to negate the dome's magnetic field. Joe, remember that experiment we did when we wrapped the copper wire around nails? A homemade magnet. If we build a really huge one a-and connect it to a big enough power supply... It might be able to counteract the dome's pulses. Right. Well, you're gonna need a massive conductor... something iron or steel. And plenty of copper wire. Hey. You really think that this is gonna work, a-a giant magnet? Well, you got something better? The dome showed a vision to the four hands. It showed us Big Jim's death. But we didn't kill him and the dome reacted. Badly. The dome wants Jim dead. And I don't think this is gonna stop until that happens. I hate Big Jim as much as you do. But taking another man's life... I know how much that costs. So let's just try this the science teacher's way first. All right, let's go. We're running out of time. Okay. 
 
 I'm not moving my mom. Y-You and Angie can stay here and we'll go. Okay? Okay. I-I hope that this works. Watch out for him. (Whimpering) (Gasping) Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. (Shushing) It's all right. You were having a dream. (Shuddering) You're all right. (Sighs) You've got a nice touch. So do you. Not everyone would've jumped into the water the way you did. Especially in your condition. You gonna tell me how you wound up out in the middle of nowhere with a bullet wound in your shoulder? Short answer: I was given an ultimatum. I tried to do the right thing and now I'm not sure that I did. Is it about that guy you mentioned earlier? We don't have to talk about it. You can just... stay here. Rest. I can't. Something awful is happening out there and it might be my fault. I have to try and fix it; I might be the only one who can. Why you? Can you look after the girl? Maybe try to get her story. Hey, wait. Be safe. Thank you, Sam. ♪ Hey! (Gasps) Are you all right? (Bell jingles) (Panting) (Keys jingle) (Bell jingles) What are you looking for? Uh... a gun. We used to keep one here. (Sighs) What for? (Metal clinking) (Sighs) Your father. And you if you try to stop me. I won't try to stop you, Angie. He's a liar... and a murderer; he killed Dodee. You were right; we should've stopped him when the dome told us to. We can end this, Junior. I can get you a gun from the station. I can do that much. (Swallows) Okay. (Bangs on countertop) What are you? A messenger. I'm listening. No, you're not. You're still thinking you're gonna get out of here and keep on keeping on killing whoever gets in your way. Screw you. I don't care if you are the dome... or whatever the hell else you are. I'm the only one who can run this town. The whole town's going down, and it's your fault. You've never sacrificed, not once in your life, and now... you're gonna have to. Shut up and be dead! I'm busy. See? You're not listening. But you will. BARBIE: All right, that's it. That's high enough. Just leave that alone. Here, let me see that tape. Looks like we're all wired up. Do you think the magnet's strong enough to generate a current to counteract the dome? All that copper wire's gonna give the dome a run for its money. (Rumbling) BARBIE: No, no, no, no, let's go. Everybody get back. Stand back, get back. Get back. (Generators whirring) JOE: The magnet isn't working. The charge needs time to build up. If it doesn't work this time, how long till the next contraction? It'll work. Trust me. DODEE: Last warning. It won't just be you who pays if you keep using the dome to make yourself king of Chester's Mill. Who you talking about? Sins of the father, Jimmy, are always visited on the son. Gah! (Coughing) (High-pitched tone sounding) (Indistinct murmuring) (Gasping) Joe! Joe! No! (Panting) ♪ 
♪ Tender we fall ♪ 
♪ Quiet and alone... ♪ Ma'am... Ma'am, please! ♪ Tired and gone... ♪ Mom? James? ♪ Speechless... ♪ Oh, my God. It is you. Why-why-why did you leave me? No. No, baby, it was never you I left. Not ever, you're my sweet boy. Not anymore. ♪ Coming up for it... ♪ (Laughs) You can't fool me, James. You never could. (Laughs) You're my sweet, sweet boy. BIG JIM: Junior! Junior! Junior! Oh, God. Can you hear me? Junior? Hang on. Junior! Hang on! Barbie? Barbie?! I thought you were dead. Come on. You're not gonna get rid of me that easy. I didn't believe. You didn't believe what? That I was doing the right thing. That the dome would protect you. Babe, I don't think it was the dome that saved me. Then how do you explain all this? Some people say it's from the magnetism, not 'cause the dome's angry. Joe... He's barely breathing. The next wave, maybe that takes us out, too. And then... I-I don't know how to fix this. Son, can you hear me? Hang on. Just hang on. (Crying): Oh, God... Tell me what you want me to do! Tell me! Oh, who the hell am I talking to? LINDA: You can talk to me, Jim. What the hell are you supposed to be? Ghost of Christmas Future? The future depends on you. Tell me how I can help him. Come to me, Jim. Come to me. Please, Linda. Please, tell me... tell me what I can do. Come. Tell Big Jim Rennie what to do? I wouldn't dare. Big Jim Rennie does as he pleases. Everything you do, you do it for your own good. Look at yourself. Look at your son. The only person left in this world you claim to care about. Time's running out, Jim. But it's not too late. Not too late for what? To learn the virtue of sacrifice. To save your son. ♪ (Breathing hard) Jim! What the hell are you doing? What the dome wants me to do. I can't pull the damn lever. Either of you want the honors? I'll do it. No... Julia. Hey. Hey, you don't have to do this. Why now? Why does it matter? Just pull the damn lever. Do it. Do it. Do it now. Do it! No! I can't do what you do. Coward. (Coughing, choking) What...? The dome didn't want us to kill you. It wants us to end the killing. Sorry. (Crowd cheering) It's hard to believe a couple hours ago, they were all out cold. And a few hours before that, they were out for your blood. It's easier than I thought to get there. You know, letting Big Jim live was the right thing to do. For today. Lucky for me, he felt the same about you. (Quiet laugh) Lucky for both of us. REBECCA: You went from grand theft auto to a gold star, Mr. Barbara. Ah, I was just doing what the teacher told me. Um... Rebecca here is the one who came up with the way to repel the dome's magnetic pulses. And he did most of the heavy lifting. I-I tried to get a read on the rig, but my magnetometer's blown. Really wish I'd been conscious to see the tower work. Uh, you think that's what stopped the surges? And cleared the dome? What else could it have been? Something bigger than us. Refill, Ange? Thanks, hon. Mm-hmm. Barbie deserved to swing, and you let him go. What the hell, Jim? Phil, we got caught up looking for scapegoats. But we were wrong. And the dome told us so. (Snickers) Barbie's innocent. I'm gonna make sure the good people of this town know it. Just be grateful we got out of this thing alive. Not all of us. We'll have to carry on the good work of those we lost. What do you say, Phil? Can I count on you? Heard you kids helped out over at the fire tower today. I wanted to, uh, I wanted to thank you for pitching in. It was Ms. Pine's idea. Whatever works. I also heard you lost your house. I wanted to let you know that my home is your home. It might get a little cozy, but, uh... Wait, what? Come live with you? Well, at least it's a, uh, it's a roof over your heads. Well, that's really generous of you, Jim. Thank you. Just make yourselves at home. See you at supper. (Chuckles) That magnet mess with your brain? You keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Trust me, Eleanor. My brain's fine. Uh, uh, Mr. Rennie? Hi. Um, do you have a second? As many as you like, Ms. Pine. My, uh, wife always said you were her best student. Uh, today I learned why. The fire tower magnet got us through the day. But I'm not gonna sleep tonight. Neither should you. Yeah, I think both of us need some sleep tonight. Those surges fried most of our power sources. Who knows what other damage they've caused? I've got to survey our water supply, determine how to find another source of power... Look, uh, sunrise, new eyes. What do you say we figure this out over breakfast tomorrow morning? All right. Yeah. Great. Coffee? Thanks. Mm-hmm. I think I'll, uh, I'll just go sit down. You know, it was a good thing that I wasn't up on those gallows with you. (Quiet laugh) 'Cause I'd have kicked out that trap door and danced while you hung at the end of the rope. Listen, Angie. This all happened for a... No, get off of me! I'm sorry. Go to hell. (Door closes) What was that? You had my back today. Do you still have it? Of course I do. (Door closes) Who's that? My uncle. Kid. You got big. You want to sit down? No, thanks. I'm looking for someone. She's about 17. Long dark hair, tall? Yeah, that sounds like a girl I saw down the street earlier. But I didn't recognize her. Which way did she go? Toward the old Food Mart. Y-You want some help? I got it. I'll see you, Junior. JULIA: Barbie, pull over. I'll be right back. Sam? (Car door closes) Hey. How's the girl? She's gone. I searched the woods around my cabin. I've been looking all over town. She was in bad shape. I know, I'm sorry. Well, she couldn't have gone far, we'll find her. You look flushed. You okay? (Sighs) Yeah, I'm fine. Everything all right over here? Barbie, this is Sam Verdreaux. Sam, Dale Barbara. Nice work on those stitches. Glad to see that you made it. You take good care. Last time I saw Sam was Mom's funeral. Showing up just the way he did now. Well, you never can tell with him. Sam's been out of his head for quite a while now. I don't think it's a coincidence. When I passed out earlier... S-Son? What happened today. I'm sorry I dismissed what you had to say. Maybe you're right. About the dome? Yes. Then listen to me. When I passed out earlier, it was like I went somewhere. And I saw Mom. She talked to me. And then my Uncle Sam comes walking through the front door? We all saw things today. Just because you dreamed about your mom doesn't mean she's alive. No, no. This wasn't a dream. This was real. Junior... Don't call me that! My name is James. (Door closes) James. (Sighs) MALE REPORTER: Breaking news on the mysterious dome that descended over the town of Chester's Mill. There has still been no official statement on reported abnormal magnetic activity, or why the temporarily opaque dome suddenly cleared. The world remains fascinated by the dome and concerned for those still trapped inside. Hello? ♪ Are you okay? No, no, no. No! I'm not gonna hurt you! (Screaming)
