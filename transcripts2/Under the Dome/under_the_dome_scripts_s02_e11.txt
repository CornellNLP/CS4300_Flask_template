 BARBIE: A few weeks ago, an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world. 
 Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead, we still don't know. 
 Every day it tests our limits, bringing out the best and the worst in us. 
 Some say we'll be stuck here forever, but we will never stop fighting to find a way out. Pauline, how did you get inside the dome? The temperature's dropped in the last two days. You came back. How'd the others fare? Lyle, he didn't come up out of the water with the rest of us. If that's the power source to the dome, we could all die. If you don't, he'll kill you. That thing's going to Zenith. It needs to go now. (Gasps) Melanie! Phil! He's gone. Yeah, he's gone. The passage closed. We're stuck here. (Electric sizzling, crackling) (Buzzing) MAN: What is it doing? Put it down. Put it down, now! (Crackling, whooshing) (Screaming) What's happening to her? I don't know, but her heart rate's dropping again. This is James Rennie. Barbie, you out there? (Screaming) Barbie, you there? Junior, it's Rebecca. What's wrong? It's Melanie. She's in real trouble. Say we're bringing her to the clinic. W-We're on our way to the clinic. Don't go to the clinic. Why not? REBECCA: Earthquake brought down some of the ceiling. Come to the high school. We're setting up a triage center. We're on our way. Hold on to her, Sam. You shouldn't have dropped the egg. It was driving you crazy. You were in pain. You think I can't handle a little pain. Well, I was just trying to help. And, look, you're your old self again. You don't know who I am. I don't think you ever knew who I am. Listen, I'm not going to apologize for doing what was right. That's the problem. You always think you're qualified to make judgments about what other people's best interests are. Why are we arguing? We're gonna get out of here. You, me and Junior. Are you sure about that? Because after what you did, it's going to affect a lot more people than just you, me and Junior. Where's the locker? This way. Jim! What gave you the right? Easy. No, we had a plan. That egg didn't go over the cliff till everyone got out safely. Well, plans change. So, you put a gun on those kids? You forced them to bring the egg to the cliff? Hey! He kept that egg a secret for a hell of a long time. Same thing for the tunnels. We could have had everyone out of here a week ago. Well, now no one gets out. Ever. What are you talking about? We gave those rent-a-cops their egg, now we all get out. There's nowhere to go, Jim. What do you mean? Right here. When you dropped that egg, you closed the passage. Only place that cliff leads to is the bottom of a ravine. The way to Zenith is blocked? BARBIE: Oh, it's more than blocked, it's gone. Phil found that out the hard way. Phil... he's in jail. Yeah, well, he broke out. He jumped off of that cliff. He died at the bottom of it. Now, we're the ones that are in jail. And you're the one who put us here. I thought we'd all get out. I did it for you, Pauline... and the people of this town. Jim? Mrs. Rennie. Becky Pine? No one calls me Becky, anymore. I am... We all thought you were d... Yeah, I know. It's good to see you, Rebecca. Yeah. Yeah, you, too. Much as I'd love to catch up,  there are a few slightly more pressing matters to deal with. What's going on? A lot of people were hurt in the quake. The clinic's out of commission, so this high school's a hospital now, and we need everyone's help. Good luck with that. Start with handing out some blankets, shall we? We may have bigger problems than the quake. The temperature's still dropping. Yeah, I noticed. And if it continues, I can't predict how many people might freeze to death before morning. (Shuddering) (Shivering): I wish I'd known you were mid-Glacial Period when I came here from Zenith. I'd have packed different clothes. Did you pack any clothes? No. Then, shut up. Quit complaining. Put this on. Are you sure we have to do this? We need to see if tossing the egg over had any effect on the dome. I mean, if it's a power source, and it's gone, then... maybe the dome... Just freezes. (Ice crackles) JOE: It's moving. It's moving! I can't get it off! JOE: What the hell is happening? (Grunting) NORRIE: Joe... What happened to Melanie? She collapsed. We're not sure why. The rest are injuries from the quake. We lost two people already. Come here. This all happened after we dropped the egg off the cliff. We did this. No, Jim did this. If he comes near you again, I'll kill him. Rebecca... something even weirder is happening. The dome walls are rotating. They might have started moving a while ago, we just didn't notice. The dome might be coming down. This could be our way out. I don't think so. The dome's a sphere. It's more like it's revolving. Revolving? Could explain the temperature drop and the clouds creeping down the side of the dome, like, like the upper atmosphere is being pulled down. Isn't the air even colder up there? REBECCA: Much colder. Hunter's still out at the dome. He'll tell us what's actually happening. Pauline. Listen, I know you're angry. But it's not like I tried to maroon us here on purpose. I wanted us to get out of here, so we could be a family again. I understand. But your good intentions don't always produce good results. Hey. I dropped that egg to save you. No, you dropped that egg to save the day, to be the hero you always want to be. That's not love, that's narcissism. What do you want me to do, just sit back, and let you go crazy? Support every insane idea that you have? Like Lyle did? Lyle would never betray me. He would never go behind my back. Do you love him? This is not about love, Jim! Or hurt feelings. This is about you  acting without any regard for what anyone else wants. Because of what you did, I can't paint anymore, the visions are gone, and Lyle may never come back  from wherever the hell he is. The dome had a plan for him. Yeah? Well, it's got a plan for me, too. And, like you said, when one door closes, another one opens. You also said we'd be a family again. I came back for my son. I told you what you needed to hear to get you out of my way. But even lying to you doesn't work. Now, we're all stuck here because of how much you love me. REBECCA: I timed how fast the clouds are descending, and how fast Joe said the wall is shifting, and there's no other way to explain it, except, the atmosphere is inverting. Okay. Frigid high-altitude air replacing the warm air below it. JULIA: So, how do we stop it? REBECCA: I don't know if we can. Well, then, we have to make sure everyone's sheltered, with adequate heat. We sent some people to the church. There's a working generator there, gassed up. The one here is half-full, but, with the way we're riding it, I don't know if it will last the night. Also, we don't have much food or water. If we're stuck here with no provisions, things will go south fast. Well, there's still a decent amount at the Sweetbriar. Don't know how secure it is, though. If it gets as cold as you think it's going to... We could lose it all to a freeze. I'll find Barbie, take the ambulance, fill it up with food. Sounds good. Um... you sure Barbie's okay? Barbie's fine. He'll be fine. Prius is charged up and ready to go if anyone needs it. Keep warm. Once night falls, you won't last more than a few minutes outside without serious consequences. MELANIE: It's hard to breathe. JUNIOR: Can you hold off? You're gonna be fine. Do you mind if I sit with her for a little while? I'll be around. Pauline. I mean, they... they told me you were alive, but... Seeing you here, it-it's amazing. You look like you did 25 years ago. I must look old. I'd know you anywhere. My best friend. Who left me for dead. Oh, my God. Melanie. I am so sorry  for what happened that night, for what they did. I should have stopped them, gotten help, done something. It's my fault as much as anyone's. The egg... it made that sound that scared you, didn't it? Yes. It-it-it just seems like ancient history. To me it seems like yesterday. I missed you. Aw... I missed you, too. We're gonna get you well. And then we'll figure out why you're here. JULIA: As long as none of it's ruined,  we should have enough food to get by. And what then? I don't know. Half the town's not gonna make it through this cold. The few crops we have left will be decimated. So, let's say that no other catastrophes hit, and the food lasts longer, 'cause we've got fewer people, what then? You know, maybe we make it to October before we have to start deciding who's gonna starve to death first. We'll figure it out. We survived this long. I'm getting tired of survival being the best-case scenario here. My only purpose in coming back here was to get you, get the hell out of this place. Maybe there's another reason. And what would that be? (Rattling, clanking) I better tie that down. Julia! Hang on! Barbie! Julia! (Groans) Julia! Can you hear me? (Groans) There you are. You had me worried. What happened? We hit a patch of ice. We're lucky to be alive. Come on. Up slowly. Ready? (Screams) What? What? What? What? What? What? Don't move. (Groans) Okay, okay. Can you take it out? It's too dangerous. It might be lodged in an artery. So it might be the only thing keeping me from bleeding to death. Yeah. Yeah. All right, here we go. A little pressure. (Yells) I know! I know. I'm sorry. Here. Right here. All right, hold that. Got to be something in here for the pain. Can we radio anyone? Broken. I don't suppose we're close enough to the Sweetbriar. Not in this weather. Someone will see that we didn't come back, they'll come looking for us. We just wait? That could take hours. Well, the engine's running, so... we've still got heat. Till we run out of gas. Look, I don't like this either, all right? But, given that wound and the freezing cold... staying here, that-that's the best of our bad options. I need to ask you a favor. Ask someone else. I need you to go talk to your mom. She's too pissed to listen to me right now, and she's got her reasons, okay? But I need you to go to her, be my advocate. Why would I ever help you get her back? Given the choice, most kids would like to see their parents back together. Mm, most kids, sure. But why do you think I never told you she was alive? What are you talking about? I found out a week ago. Wait, wait. You knew this a week ago? That's right. She didn't want you to know. All I wanted to do was find a way out of here, and get us both the hell away from you. But now, you've made that impossible. Wait. I didn't know it was going to happen. I had a plan. It didn't work out the way I expected. I didn't know that throwing the egg over the cliff was gonna start a quake. Wait, wa-wait. The-the earthquake started when you dropped the egg? Yeah. Melanie collapsed at the same time. What's the temperature outside? Two degrees and dropping. We're sealing up the windows, but we're still gonna have to crank up the heaters. It'll use our fuel a lot faster, but... I don't think we have a choice. Hey! Can you close that door? Hunter? Are you all right? Yeah. You've got frostbite. We need to wrap that up. Okay? Thank you. You were outside the dome? Why'd you come back to Chester's Mill? Was it because of Junior? But that's not the only reason. You forgot how well I know you, Pauline. After that night at the crater... I tried to live as full a life... as I knew how to. I fell in love, I married Jim, we had a son... but deep inside I knew something was wrong. I knew I was running from what we did. From what I did. But I'm done running now. And I am here to finish what you, Sam, me and Lyle started 25 years ago. And this time, I'm not leaving your side. You promise? I promise. What do we need to do? (Gasping) Melanie... Sam! Sam?! (Indistinct talking) Someone get Sam! Melanie? Is she dead? No, she has a pulse, but it's incredibly weak. What's happening to her? It-it must be the egg. Melanie's connected to it. Whatever happens to it, happens to her. Someone must be doing something to it. What's it like out there? It's bad. I put the flares out so anyone that passes by, they'll be able to see us. (Engine stops) You got to be kidding me. Are we out of gas? (Engine cranking) (Grunting) Oh! Come on! Go. You can make it to the diner. No, you'd freeze before I got back. Better one than both of us. No! I'm not leaving here without you. What are you looking for? This. Petroleum jelly? This is going to save our lives. As long as we can keep the cold air out. Yeah, it is. 
 
 This is gonna hurt like hell once the numbness wears off. But, Doctor, will I ever be able to play the piano again? You were out there for a long time. Yeah, I got lost. Did you know that there's a "Little Bitch Road" about a mile from here? Yeah, it used to be the most exciting thing about Chester's Mill. Hey, can I ask you a question? Something I just never understood. The egg is the power source of the dome, right? Yeah, as far as we know. Yeah, but when you moved it, the dome didn't move with it. How does that work? It's a technology we don't understand. But you guys moved it, didn't you? And when that Big Jim guy tried to, he got zapped like Marty McFly  and his silver pick in Back to the Future. So...  are you the only ones who...? You're asking a lot of questions. Why so much interest in the egg? I'm just curious, boss. MAN: Help! Help! Somebody help my wife! Set her down, set her down. Guys, move! Move! Excuse me, excuse me. REBECCA: Norrie, get some blankets. We made a fire to stay warm, but I fell asleep, and when I woke up, she was... And I couldn't get the car started, and I... (Whimpers) I'm not getting a pulse. Oh, my God. Please help her! Please! I'm sorry, Tom. No... This can't be happening. (Whimpering): Oh, geez... We were just... just having a fire... I understand. I'm sorry. Sorry, I underst... Rebecca, what's going on? We just ran out of fuel. Get everybody in here or the gym. Extra body warmth will help. We need to move the equipment aside, and bring in the cots, okay? Is this enough? For everyone healthy, probably, but all those who are sick? I don't know. Where are you going? We need fuel for the generators. I'm gonna go find some. Where? It's too cold to go out and search blindly. Who said anything about "blindly"? This is my town. I know where to look. Take Julia's Prius. We've siphoned the gas out of everyone else's car. JULIA: A single candle can really keep us alive? You'd be surprised how much heat one candle can give off. All right. (Breathing heavily) Okay. (Shuddering) Okay. You know, if I didn't have a giant piece of metal sticking into my leg, this might almost be romantic. Mmm. So, what's going on with you? What do you mean? You're acting like you're losing hope. We had a way out of here, Julia. We're not gonna get another one. So, we'll spend the rest of our lives here. (Wry laugh) We'll make the best of it. (Glass cracking) (Grunts) Shh... What was that? (Crackling) Oh, God. (Panting) I'm not sure she can take another attack like this. If whoever's got the egg keeps messing with it. How can the thing that somehow brought her back to life now let her slip away? Norrie? You gonna check on her? Maybe you should go. Rebecca asked me to check all the windows for drafts around the school. We can't stay here. And you can't leave. Then leave without me. Wrap up as best you can and go. No, Julia. If you leave now, you can make it. No. I said... Barbie. I'm not leaving without you. I... I would rather die alone, knowing you were okay, than be a little bit warmer a little bit longer. Please. We're gonna find a way out of here. How? I don't know. It's so cold. That's it. What? You know what happens with hypothermia? Your heart slows down. It stops pumping. And you can pull the rod out without me bleeding to death. And I can get us both to the Sweetbriar. I'll be gone by then. People can come back from hypothermia. Good. Yeah, good. Simple. (Laughs) You're not leaving me. Not for good. You ready? (Grunts) Oh, God. (Winces) BIG JIM: Becky, you there? Here. All right, been to the market and two farms. Struck out on fuel so far. You coming back? Yeah, I'm just gonna check these two boats at the lake. Unless you want some serious frostbite, be careful you're not outside for more than a few minutes at a time. So, don't linger out in the cold, is that what you're saying? Thanks for the help. (Grunting) Bingo. LYLE (Gurgling): Help! What the holy hell? Jim! Lyle? Please! Jim! Please, Jim! Please! (Grunts) Oh, God. Melanie's gonna die. You don't know that for sure. And it's all my fault. No. I never should've let Big Jim knock that egg out of my hand. He had a gun on you and Joe. I should've just let him kill me. And everyone could've gotten out, and now we're really stuck. (Sighs) Now whoever has that egg can do whatever they want to it, and we can't get it back and we can't even tell them to stop. Maybe someone in Zenith will figure out how to make it work. How? There's only a few people who can touch the egg. And they're all inside the dome. Really? Yeah. And it's all my fault. Maybe I should go see if anyone needs help. It seems like that is all you do. Help people. (Sighs) I'm sorry you got stuck in here. But it's actually nice having you around, you know? Thanks. (Lyle shivering, panting) BIG JIM: Get in. Thank you. Thank you. (Grunts) (Shuddering, gasping) How long was I gone? Your friends got back a few days ago. Oh. Hey, Jim? Jim. You got to listen to me. The whole world... was on fire. There were waves of flames a thousand feet up, circulating endlessly. Destroyed everything... everything was just... That's impossible, Lyle. No, it's not. I saw it. (Exhales) It was beautiful. You should just start thinking about where you want to be at the end of the world, Jim. 'Cause the end is coming. And there's nothing you can do. I don't need to think about it, Lyle. I want to be with my family. It's like falling asleep. I'm gonna wake you up so soon. It's okay... if you don't. I will. I... I can't see you. I'm right here, baby. Keep talking to me. You're just gonna go to sleep... and then you're gonna wake up. Then we're gonna have a life together. We're gonna have love. And kids. Everything. We're gonna have anything that you want. Love you, too. (Panting, sniffles) Okay. Stay with me. (Panting) Okay. All right. Now listen to me. You don't get to leave me yet. We got too many things to do. All right, baby. All right. Okay, here we go. Here we go. (Panting) Stay with me. Stay with me. Hey! Need a little help here! (Coughing) Oh, my God. Is that Lyle? Yeah. Fished him out of the lake. Yeah. LYLE: Waves of flames... a thousand feet up... Did you find any fuel? Yes, I did. It's in the car. I think it's enough to get us through the night. Hey, Jim. Yeah? Thank you. (Exhales, grunts) Okay, baby. Okay. (Grunts) We made it. We made it, baby. Almost there. (Panting) (Whispering): Baby, it's time to wake up now. (Panting) (Quivering) (Panting) Okay. (Grunting) Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come back for me. I came back for you; come back for me now, come on. (Whimpers) (Panting, sniffles) (Lightly gasps) (Quiet gasps, whimpers) Barbie...? Shh... Easy, baby. What happened? I've missed you. I was so calm. I was so... (Panting): so cold. Come here. Come here. It's gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay. You guys, come here. Temperature's rising. Sun's coming out? That's part of it, but the barometric pressure... it's higher than it should be. Something's changed. What? No idea. But as quickly as things happen in here? We'll find out soon enough. Hey, where'd Hunter go? Better follow him and find out. Why? I saw something he didn't want me to see. I was at that game, you know. I saw you block that field goal. You won that game for the mighty, mighty Woodchucks. (Soft chuckle) Well, I... I blocked a kick, but... I didn't score any touchdowns. That's not how you used to tell it. (Laughs quietly) Well, um... don't let the truth get in the way of a good story. So Lyle's back. Back from his, uh, travels through space and time. He's safe. And, uh, well... not all that sound. Why did you do it, Jim? Why did you save him? Isn't it obvious, Pauline? I did it for you. 'Cause you said you need him. Look, I haven't always been the best... husband. Or father. I can admit that. But it isn't because I didn't care or wasn't trying. It's just the opposite. Everything I've done, I've done for my family. For you. I'll do whatever it takes to protect the people I love. (Sighs) It's getting warm outside now. Looks like we'll make it another day. Yeah, looks like. I used to love coming to your games. Even if you weren't catching touchdowns. Stop, Joe, there he is. I told you he wasn't on our side. I trusted him. What the hell are you doing?! I'm trying to help. Liar. We saw your phone. You're working for the guy who held us captive over the egg. Why are you here? Look, they sent me here to report back to them about the egg. He's been monitoring it for weeks from the outside. What did you tell him? Just read it for yourself, all right? You told them to stop messing with the egg? Whatever they're doing to it in Zenith is obviously killing Melanie in here, and I couldn't let that happen. But why? I hate those guys. I never wanted to help them in the first place. They forced me to. How? I have... you know, a bit of a record back home that they used against me. You think that guy will tell 'em to stop doing whatever they're doing with the egg? I am the only one they've got on the inside. They better listen to me. (Loud metallic grinding) What the hell is that?! I don't know... the dome's never made that sound before. It's starting. (Grinding stops) (Low electric hum) It stopped spinning. (Hum) (Hum) (Thud) (Rumbling) (All stammering, gasping) Uh, why's that happening? Because the dome's contracting. You mean it's shrinking? But if it doesn't stop, then... Then it'll kill us all.
