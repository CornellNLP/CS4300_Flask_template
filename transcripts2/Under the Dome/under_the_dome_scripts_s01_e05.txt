 JULIA:  Chester's Mill is a place like any other. 
 At least it used to be until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome. (cows bellowing) Invisible, indestructible, inescapable. We're trapped. JULIA:  We don't know where it came from or why it's here,  but now that we're all trapped  under the dome together, none of our secrets are safe. BARBIE:  I linked up with a bookie. Taking bets? Making sure that people paid what they owed. When I get home, you better be gone. BIG JIM:  You ever consider  a career in law enforcement? BOTH: The pink stars are falling. Shh... (walkie-talkie feedback) Norrie? Norrie, where are you? Right behind you, genius. I didn't realize that crashing with a farm kid meant that I had to get up at the ass-crack of dawn. Come on, it's about the dome. Really? Is it gone? Are we finally free? You'll see. I've been thinking about our seizures. About what we said. "The pink stars are falling." You figured out what that means? Not yet, but if the dome is really sending out messages, then we're like human receivers. We can catch a few of the transmissions on our own, but when we get too close to each other... (feedback screeching) Feedback. Joe, why would the dome only talk to us? I don't know. But when I came out here to find out, I saw this. (laughs) Yeah, right? Monarch butterflies aren't even in season. They shouldn't be anywhere near Chester's Mill this time of year. Maybe the dome sent them. Maybe it's trying to tell us that the dome's just a cocoon, and when it finally goes away, we'll all get to be something new. You realize most caterpillars are actually eaten before they turn into butterflies? (both laugh) (birds chirping) (latch clacks open loudly) (water dripping) (panting) Mr. Rennie. Oh, thank God. What took you so long? Feeling better there, darling? Better? I've been down here all night. Why haven't you gotten the police yet? Mr. Rennie, you're gonna get me out of here, right? Of course. Soon as you tell me exactly what it is you're doing down here. He's been keeping me prisoner! Who? Your son. Junior? No. Why would... why would...? Why would he do something like that? Because he's insane. Please... you got to get me out of here before he comes back. (car horn honking outside) Big Jim? Please, please! I just, uh, I just need to think on this a little bit. No, no, no! You can't leave me down here! You can't... you... No, wait! Wait! Help! Please! No! Help! (screaming): Help! Help! No! (screaming) (screaming continues) (horn continues honking) Damn it, Coggins, I thought we were done. What are you doing here? Jim. I received a very troubling message. No! I have to tell you. What message? From the Lord Almighty. He whispered one word to me. Moab. Moab? Moab. You better check the batteries in your hearing aid, Coggins, 'cause that's not even a word. Jim! Moab was a place. A very wicked place. Much like Chester's Mill. I'm warning you, Reverend. Stay away from me. Jim. Ji... 
(door slams) (hearing add feedback screeching) DEEP, DISTORTED VOICE: Moab. (feedback screeching) 
Moab. (static crackles) Moab... Moab. (feedback screeching, static crackling) Moab. JOE: Over here. NORRIE: Look at them all. (laughs): Oh, my God, there's more. Where did they all come from? So beautiful. Barbie? What is this? Isn't it amazing? (birds chirping) (laughs) Huh. These guys are suddenly paying attention to us? Look. They're bussing in more soldiers? No, civilians. Hey, that's Frank! NORRIE: Who? JOE: My cousin. He went away to college before the dome came down. Okay, it's been over a week since this thing came down. Military hasn't let anybody near here. So why bus the families in now? Haven't you ever been to camp? They're finally giving us our own visitors' day. JULIA:  We have official confirmation  from military representatives that at 10:00 a.m. this morning, the people of Chester's Mill will be permitted to visit with their loved ones on the outside. The location for this is where the dome intersects with the Sixth Street bridge. For further updates, stay tuned to WYBS. (clock ticking) (door opens) (door closes) We need to talk. No, I know. You heard the news? The Feds are bussing in people who got caught outside the dome. What? Yeah, they just started coming in this morning. The press, too. Well, you're gonna need help with crowd control. Linda's already talking about bringing in some more deputies. Time for talk is over. I'm authorizing you to recruit auxiliary officers. Dad, I... How about Carter? The fullback from your year? (sighs) I should get some supplies first from... the old shelter. When I tell you to do something, Junior, what do you do? Dad, I know... Now! Shouldn't we get your moms? Why? It's not like any of their phony L.A. friends are gonna make the trip. Yeah, but you never made it to where you were headed. Somebody out there's probably worried. (scoffs): Who cares? I'm just excited to meet your folks. I can't wait to tell them you're shacking up with an underage girl and two lesbians. (laughs) (bell dinging) Barbie? (car door closes) I can use your help. We need to keep people a safe distance from this thing. We don't want people's cameras or cell phones blowing up like Duke's pacemaker. String this up. Until we find out what the hell the dome is, I don't want anyone on our side touching it, no matter what. You got it. (laughs softly) Rusty. (indistinct radio transmission) Is it true? They're really letting us see our families? Yeah. Really? Hey, did Dodee pick up any chatter about this? Uh, no. I've been listening to her E.T.-phone-home thing, but the military broadcasts dropped out last night so all we've been getting are random numbers and crap. (radio beeping, squawking) MAN: Zone one is painted. Green for 1315. Zone one is painted. Green for 1315. What does that mean? Who cares? Getting visitors is the first good news we've had... since ever. ...global audience awaits any hint of what's happened inside... Do you think he'll show up today? Peter? Julia, I... Phil. It's all right. Barbie told me what you guys were into. I know my husband left me because he has a gambling problem. But that was before all this. He's got to show his face today, doesn't he? This is Jeff Glor at Chester's Mill. It's been six days Yeah, I th... since the invisible barrier arrived over Chester's Mill. That doesn't sound like another army guy. Ever since the military evacuated surrounding towns and established a ten-mile perimeter around what's being called "The Dome," the world has been waiting for news from inside. Last night, the government relented, allowing select members of the press to document these emotional reunions. MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, as you approach the dome, make sure if you have a tablet in your hand that you do not touch the dome. And look, we're famous. They want to make a reality show out of us. I-I know... (indistinct chatter) NORRIE: Who are you looking for? I'm looking for Angie. You said your sister's a flake. Yeah, she is, but... she'd definitely come to this. The hell? Nore? No. My mom said I came from an anonymous donor. JOE: That's your mom. Sinners! Sinners! Over and over, the Lord has spoken one word in my ear: Moab. Why? Because we are Moab. (high-pitched tone) Moab! Okay, thank you, Reverend. Thank you for those inspiring words. Enjoy your loved ones. So help me God, if you ruin this day for these people, I'm gonna... What, beat me to a pulp? In front of the congregation? (chuckles) I'm not scared of you anymore, Jim Rennie. All I fear is the wrath of my Lord. And the only way we're gonna be spared His fury is if we confess our sins. Sins. Hmm. We saved Chester's Mill. (laughing): We helped drug dealers make their poison. We never let 'em sell it here. It's not my fault you dipped into their supply. All you ever think about is fattening your own coffers. Damn it, Lester, you listen... No, you listen to me! You may have fooled some of these people into thinking you're some kind of leader. But nobody's going to follow you anywhere, ever, when they hear just exactly who you are. What do you want, Reverend? For you admit your sins before God, and every man and woman in Chester's Mill. You have one day... one day to come clean... ...or I do it for you. GLOR: It's the final hour of the government's Visitors' Day, as the last of... (indistinct chatter) (indistinct chatter) Hey. That's my sister. Linda. Hey. Any sign of your husband? Not yet. What about you? Did you find your fiancé? Yeah. Everything all right? I just... couldn't bring myself to tell him. About what? His brother. Linda, Freddy's death was an accident. He got shot on my watch. It's my responsibility to tell Rusty. I just... I just don't know how. Yeah... you do. CAROLYN: Oh. Norrie? Norrie. Where the hell have you been? Michael? So it's true, this guy's my dad? Norrie, it's complicated. No. You told me the records were sealed. That we couldn't even look for him. And all these years, you've been lying to me. How dare you? You have never been anything to this girl! But the second that cameras show up, you decide you suddenly have a daughter? Alice... take it easy. I hate you. (sniffs) 
I hate you all so much. Norrie! Let's... JULIA: Barbie. Have you seen him? Peter. I know that nothing that I'm gonna say is gonna make up for the fact that I... that I should have told you the truth sooner. You're right. But I don't blame you for my husband's bad decisions. And if you really want to make it up to me, just keep an eye out for him. Excuse me. Sorry. Mary. (indistinct radio transmission) (indistinct radio transmission) (mouthing) Julia, what's the matter? That was my sister-in-law. What did she say? She showed me a letter that she got from my husband. It said, "I know this is confusing, "but all I can say is sorry. Tell Julia she deserves better". Guy didn't even have the balls to send his own Dear John letter. (indistinct chatter) It was about saying good-bye. MRS. GRINNELL: Oh, my God, I can't believe it. I... (sniffles) Oh... Oh, I.... I... Ma'am. They don't want anyone touching this thing, okay? That's my son. I haven't spoken to him in almost ten years, but here he is. I'm sure. Yeah. This thing brought him back to me. No, I-I... I understand. Hey! Leave her be. You gotta be kidding me. Somebody made  you  a cop? We'll take it from here. (indistinct chatter) (indistinct radio transmission) It's about your brother. (softly): No. (crying): I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. (sniffles) (sniffling) JOE: Norrie, wait! I don't want to talk about it. Well, what did your dad say? He's not my dad! He's just some creep who wants to be on TV. Look, I'm sorry. I just always imagined that maybe I'd get to meet a part of my past, and... never really pictured it going quite like that. BEN: Yo, McAlister! Ben, were you at Visitors' Day? Yeah, but... pretty much everyone I actually like is stuck in here with us, so... I just talked to random strangers. About what? Did you hear China threatened to attack us after the dome showed up? Seriously? Yeah, this guy said Beijing thought we were testing some kind of illegal superweapon, so the president had to talk 'em off the ledge, tell them we didn't even build it. Great. Sounds like the grown-ups have it all under control. (indistinct conversations) MAN: Bye, so long. We love you. SOLDIER: Ma'am, it's time to go. Excuse me. Can you read lips as well as you do sign language? Maybe. What's in it for me? Answers. (vehicle engine accelerating) 
 
 (indistinct radio transmission) DODEE: You know this guy? No, but my old unit is kind of infamous. Do me a favor. Just tell me what this guy's saying. It's an honor to meet one of the Jackrabbits, sir. How are things in there? Uh, forget about us. What's... happening... out... there? (mouthing) DODEE: Something big is going down. They told us to pull out after this. All of us. (mouthing) 
(vehicle depart) No clue. But they said once we leave... But they said once we leave... don't plan on coming back. Sorry, sir. We're on the move. (mouthing) (indistinct radio transmission) DODEE: Last night. After the butterflies showed up. Butterflies? Yeah, there was a whole swarm of 'em. It covered part of the dome. Huh. What? A lot of insects use magnetic fields to navigate. If the dome is altering them, then... There is no way in hell the government would stand for that. They're not about to let this thing mess with the outside world. Well, what does that mean? Moab. Come again? What your reverend was ranting about. His hearing aid must have intercepted a transmission like the ones that you're picking up at the radio station. But why would the army be telling Bible stories? Moab is not a city, it's an acronym: MOAB-- "Mother of All Bombs." That's what we call the largest nonnuclear missile in our arsenal. You think they're gonna launch that thing at the dome? Would it work? Yeah. Then why don't you look happy? Because it'll also kill everybody inside. What?! Dodee, Visitors' Day was not about saying hello to your families. It was about saying goodbye. How'd it go with Rusty? As well as it could, I guess. He left without even saying good-bye. Still, I'm glad I told him. So thank you. Councilman Rennie! We're dead. It's coming down. Whoa. Slow down, Dodee. What-what-what are you talking about? What's coming down? The army is gonna blow up the dome, even if that means blowing us up with it. That can't be true. I just got the word from a soldier on the other side. They're gonna launch a thermobaric missile right at us. Good Lord! Any idea when? I guess as soon as they evacuate everyone from outside the dome, but, no, I-I don't have a timetable. I think I do. At the radio station this morning, Phil and I heard something: "Zone One is painted green for 1315." Yeah. "Painted" means that a target's been approved. "Zone One" was written on all their trucks, so it's gotta be Chester's Mill. And 1315? Military time. That's 1:15 this afternoon. That's less than three hours. DODEE: So that's it? We're all just gonna die? LINDA: No, no. We get everybody to a shelter. Where? The old cement factory. Some of those tunnels run pretty deep. LINDA: So, what? We just relocate the entire town? What about the sick, the elderly? I'll dispatch a fleet from the car lot to help with transport. Let's just do it the best we can. All right. Hurry. I'm so sorry, sweetie. I still haven't seen Angie. Maybe she's volunteering at the clinic. We just checked there. They haven't seen Angie since the first dome day. This is Julia Shumway with an emergency broadcast. I know this news might be difficult for many of you to accept, but I give you my word that it is the truth. At 1:15 today the military plans to launch a powerful missile at our town in the hopes of destroying the dome. Did she say missile? Listen. Because we don't know what will happen when the dome collapses, it is imperative that we take shelter. For your safety, all residents of Chester's Mill must go to Sanders Cement Works immediately. Please do everything you can to help spread the word. This is not a drill. (hinges creaking) Mr. Rennie... (gasps) Oh! (panting) I can't apologize enough for what Junior did to you. He was a good boy. I don't know where I lost him. Anyway, um, you can go now. Why are you doing this? Well, if we're all gonna die today... ...you might as well die a free woman. (gasping) ♪ JULIA: We're working on the lights, sweetheart, okay? So it won't be dark for too much longer. And we'll get you a cot as soon as we can. You almost finished batting down the hatches? BARBIE (grunts): Yeah. For what it's worth. Julia, when that missile breaks through here... I know. Hey. Dodee told me how you got the story. Said the soldier started talking when you showed him some sort of a coin? I-I'm not asking on the record. Just you and me. That guy that we met, he probably only talked to us 'cause he thinks that I'm... some kind of hero. You're not? One of my deployments in Iraq, um... my unit helped rescue a captured soldier from insurgents after her company had been killed by small arms fire. God. The insurgents captured that soldier. They didn't kill her company. We did. We were on patrol. All of a sudden, someone starts shooting at us, and it's not until the dust clears we realize... we'd just shot up our own side. Killed every soldier except the one that the enemy hauled off. Maybe this is how I deserve to go. More friendly fire. Junior! Dad... what are you doing here? You first. I-I-I heard about the missile. I figured maybe we go take cover in the old bomb shelter. I know, Junior. What are you talking about? About Angie. I let her go. You did what? What the hell were you thinking? I mean... Junior, that doesn't matter anymore, Junior. Junior, we just need to get down to that factory. The town needs us, Junior. Junior! Junior! Phil, it is way past go-time! Hurry it up! Hold on. I'm setting up a playlist to broadcast right after we leave. I just have to play one last song before this thing hits. This is probably the very last thing anyone's ever gonna hear, okay? But I thought we're gonna be safe in those tunnels. From weapons of mass destruction? So-so you think this is gonna be the end? 13 minutes, we find out. Hello?! Joe?! Joe? Joe?! Where the hell is everybody?! Joe! (gasps) (gun cocks) I knew you'd come here. We're not finished yet. Just find a place somewhere over there, okay? Hey. How's everything out there? Under control. I think I got the last of the holdouts. Where's Junior? Just, uh... tying up a few loose ends. Make sure your new guys keep the peace in here. Where are you going? Tying up a few loose ends. (piano plays soothing classical music over radio) Phil. Beethoven? Keeps the folks mellow. Got something for you. What are you doing? It's your watch. It's my grandfather's watch. Yeah, I figured it probably had some sentimental value. I bet on the Browns, Barbie. That's losing, fair and square. Well, maybe I'm getting out of that line of work. Good luck, Phil. (quiet conversations) I got you this in the fourth grade, remember? When my parents took me to New York? Junior... what's happening? JULIA (on radio): This is a prerecorded emergency broadcast. At 1:15 p.m. today, the military plans to launch a powerful missile at our town, in the hopes of destroying the dome. What does that mean? We're all gonna die. Junior, you don't... Yes, I do. From the very beginning. I'm so sorry, Ange. All I wanted to do was to help you to get better. Oh... (classical music playing on radio) (music continues) (quiet conversations) Last call? (sighs) An editor gave me this bottle after my first byline. Been looking for a good excuse to drink it ever since. (sniffs) It worth the wait? It's horrible. 
(laughs) My bosses always hate me. You know, I still miss Chicago, but... Peter always said I'd grow to love this place. Where do you think he is now? Some flophouse in Vegas? Oh, Julia... Well, I made my peace with it. Besides, maybe he was right. You know, I didn't understand this place before the dome came down. But now, after everything we've been through... I'm glad I got to be a part of it. Julia, there's something that you need to hear. You don't have to say anything. No, no, you don't understand... ALICE: Help! Please! We need help! Has anyone seen our daughter? ALICE: Our daughter, Norrie. She's tall, she's got red hair. Has anyone seen her? Alice? Yes. I saw your daughter at Visitors' Day. So did we, but then she took off. And we-we haven't seen her, or her friend Joe, since. I-I'm going back out there. No way, lady. Alice... That dome's about to come crashing down on all our heads. Our girl is still out there. I'm sorry, you're not going to be able to leave right now. CAROLYN: No, no, no... Whoa, whoa. Where... where you going? When I followed Junior down here a few days ago, we found another way out. We gotta find those kids. JOE: Angie! Angie! Angie! Angie! Ange! You should go back to the shelter. No, I want to stay with you. You should be with your moms. They're your family. But you're my friend. All right. Come on. ("The End of the World" intro plays on radio) ♪ Why does the sun go on shining? ♪ 
♪ Why does the sea rush to shore? ♪ 
♪ Don't they know You played this? ♪ It's the end of the world? Skeeter Davis. She is a legend. ♪ 'Cause you don't love me anymore ♪

(muffled explosion) (birds squawking) (quiet murmuring) All right, everybody, stay put and remain calm. I'm gonna get some answers. How... W-When we touched, we didn't have the seizures. More importantly, we didn't die. (birds squawking) (sighs) BIG JIM (on radio): Linda. Linda, come in. What's the word, Jim? I'm not sure yet, but everyone's okay. (laughing) (sniffles) (laughing) Oh, my God. (exhales) He saved us. What the hell are you doing here? Hell has got nothing to do with it. God told me to come out here. To see the moment of our salvation for myself. Lester... The good Lord saved Chester's Mill. Because I repented. And now it's time for you to do the same. Jim, I know... you think this town belongs to you. And maybe... maybe it used to. But today... today's a new day. This dome has only one master. And we are all His servants. You know, you're right, Reverend. Today is a new day.
