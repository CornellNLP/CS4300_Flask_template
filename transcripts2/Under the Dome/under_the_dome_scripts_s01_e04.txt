 JULIA:  Chester's Mill is a place like any other. 
 At least it used to be, until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome. (cows bellowing) Invisible, indestructible, inescapable. We're trapped. JULIA:  We don't know where it came from or why it's here, but now that we're all trapped under the dome together, none of our secrets are safe. (shouts, grunts) Thanks again for letting me crash here. My husband isn't here, but he'll turn up. You'll see, Barbie. (shouts) (gunshot) That thing is never going to go away. (gunshots, bullets ricocheting) Oh, no. No. (door opens) (door closes) (footsteps approaching) Morning. Morning. Feeling okay? Yeah, it's just a headache. I get them sometimes when I'm stressed. Yeah, you took the last one. Dee's Pharmacy is closed. Maybe the gas station has aspirin. You know this town pretty well for someone who's just passing through. Dee's is not really a hard name to remember. Think I'll go over to the radio station. All right, well, I'll catch a ride with you. (over bullhorn): All right, everybody, orders are in. Pack it up, we're out of here. MAN: Hey, you can't leave! (overlapping shouting) Back away, Ollie, back away. This thing can really hurt you. OLLIE: Why is the military leaving? We're American citizens. The military is supposed to protect us. LINDA: Everybody, listen! I understand that you're angry, but I'm gonna ask you to disperse. (overlapping shouting) Now! You weep for mercy when you've lived lives of wickedness and pride. God does not hear you. He is the master, and you will bend to his will. Go home, this is not helping. 
"There they cry, "but none giveth answer because of the pride of evil men." This dome is his wish for a new Eden. What the hell's going on? Military's leaving. It's been three days and no answers. Folks are getting scared. You think pulling a gun is gonna reassure 'em? All right, all right, I don't blame you for wanting answers. We all want to know when this thing is coming down, but this is not helping. OLLIE: Government's left us here to rot. You're a councilman, Rennie. Why should we trust you? Because they're out there, Ollie, and I'm in here. Now please listen to the sheriff. Soon as we know what's going on out there, so will you. Go on home. (sighs) You almost lost 'em. I had it under control. What are you gonna do-- open fire on the crowd? Linda? Whoa, excuse me. Is she all right? You okay? Let's get out of here. Let's get her to a car. (grunting) (door opens) (door closes) Brought you some comfortable clothes. And a surprise. (sniffs) 
Hmm. You wore this the first time we danced. Junior prom. You were so beautiful. You want me to look beautiful? I don't mind. You're starting to act like the old Angie I knew before the dome came down. Turn around. Turn around. I think you're getting better. With trust and a little patience, I'll get her back. Right, Ange? Ange? 
(screams) (both grunting) Junior, I'm sorry. No, you're not. No, I'm sorry. I should have known. You're not better. (gasps) 
You're just pretending. Junior, please let me out. I won't tell anyone. I will forget everything. Please, I will forget about everything. Just... just let me out. You can leave whenever you're ready. (door opens) But not before. Can I help you? Uh, I'm Julia Shumway, I'm the editor of the weekly... Oh, yeah, I recognize your voice. You're the lady that's been doing the news on the radio. That why you're looking for Phil? Phil? Phil Bushey, the DJ you work with at the station. That's his car; he's got to be home. That's my husband's car. Phil! (sighs) What is all the racket? What are you doing with Peter's car? He sold it to me. Oh. I feel like crap. Phil. I need some help! One seizure happens, maybe it's no big deal. Two seizures in three days buys you both a full workup. Mom, I feel fine. Yeah, me, too. I know, but we have to be sure. Excuse me, I'm a physician. We may be dealing with something infectious that's causing seizures in both of them. I want you to do a blood count, an EEG, and if they're negative, get them MRIs. We can do the blood and EEG here, but the closest MRI is at the big hospital in Westlake, and that's five miles outside of the dome. I don't suppose you have a neurologist. We're fresh out of doctors. Look, one of them's on vacation in Vail, the other one drove his Porsche right into the dome, and Dr. Shumway is M.I.A. Then I'll do the tests. What kind of doctor are you? She's a psychiatrist, but she did her internship in medicine. Come with me. Your moms are pretty hard-core. You have no idea. All right, I'll be right there, okay? Hey, Junior, you haven't seen my sister, have you? I haven't seen her since the dome came down. Angie? Saw her a couple nights ago. Where? I don't know, around. Anything else, Little Man? I guess not. (Barbie and Big Jim grunt) What's going on with her? Not sure. She collapsed and now she's burning up. JUNIOR: Dad. Junior, what happened to your hand? Oh, uh, chopping wood. Ax slipped. Feeling okay? What happened with Linda? I don't know. NURSE: We need some help. More people are coming in with fever and headache. BIG JIM: What are we dealing with here? I don't know, it could be the flu. We need to get more cots up from the basement. I'll get it. Junior, help Barbie. He passed out. NURSE: Put him in Bay 3. What happened to Linda? BIG JIM: She passed out, too-- probably from the same thing that happened to Phil. What's going on? I wish I could tell you, Mrs. Shumway. The town's out of doctors. Sure could use your husband. (panting) Help! Help! Help! (screams) Ow! Sweetheart, keep still. Oh, you suck at this. No wonder you became a shrink. There, done. Will you run this to the lab? Sure. So, how's this thing work? It measures the electronic activity in your brain. Is everything normal? Nope, you're a mutant like Wolverine. You know X-Men? I know a lot of stuff. 
(both laugh) Norrie, not now. Your brain's as normal as any EEG I've ever seen. Then why'd we have the seizures? (door opens) Alice, Nurse Adams said you'd be here. We need your help, right away. Stay. I know this, uh, may sound crazy, but, uh, we're lucky you got trapped here in Chester's Mill. WOMAN: Excuse me. (coughing, indistinct chatter) What's going on? You tell me. We need your help. Uh, well, I'll need a mask and gloves before I examine anyone. We're out of both. What about antibiotics? We have that for now. WOMAN: Alice is gonna take your temperature. MAN: Okay. What are you doing here? Linda got sick, so Jim and I brought her in. Why? What are you doing here? I just brought in a friend of yours-- Phil Bushey. Go on up ahead; I'll, uh... I'll catch up with you. If you've never been to Chester's Mill before, how do you know Phil? (chuckles) I have no idea what you're talking about. So you went through my stuff? You lied to me about having a fight with Junior Rennie, so, yeah, I thought I would check up on maybe what else you lied about. (panting): You owe me an explanation. Barbie, just tell me the truth. Whoa, whoa. I'm okay, I just have a headache. Let's get her to the treatment area. Set those cots up down there; we are getting slammed. Mrs. Moore? Linda Esquivel. You were my third grade teacher. Of course. I remember you, Linda. You were an amazing teacher. Oh. You were a terrible student. (chuckles) Do you think it's the dome? Is that what's making us sick? I don't know, Mrs. Moore. I don't know. Dad, what the hell is going on around here? (sighs) 
Uh, some kind of outbreak. Doctor... what exactly is going on here? I think it could be meningitis. My cousin had that. It's bad. One minute he was fine, the next he was dying. We can't be sure, because the clinic doesn't have any spinal tap kits, but the symptoms-- high fever, neck pain, photophobia-- I'd be surprised if it was anything else. I think we may have an epidemic on our hands. An epidemic? How contagious is it? Very. If anyone who's sick coughs, (snaps fingers) it spreads. This damn dome. It's like an incubator. Your son probably got vaccinated when he went to college; so did my family. So, we're okay. Yeah, I got mine in the military. Yeah. Well, what about those who didn't? Well, if there's no symptoms, swallow an antibiotic and you're protected. But for these people who are sick, they need antibiotics, and they need them fast. Okay, so then how much time are we talking about? 11, maybe 12 hours. But that's not our only problem. I checked-- we don't have enough antibiotics to treat all these people. Dee's Pharmacy. Listen, Doctor. Give me a list of what you need. Let me be absolutely clear: if these people leave and it spreads... Well, we're gonna make sure it doesn't. Got that list from the doctor. Thanks. Go inside. Guard the door. Make sure no one gets out. Like a quarantine? You can call it what you'd like. Nobody leaves. Counting on you, Junior. The clinic is now closed. No one leaves, you understand? (crowd murmuring) No one. (gasps) (sputters) (panting) (whimpering) (screaming) (P.A. beeping) Phil? What? Phil, I need to know how you ended up with Peter's car. Peter, I'm sorry, man, I can't make it to the cabin tonight. Cabin? What cabin? What are you doing out of bed? I think that he knows where Peter is. Uh, where my husband is. I just need to talk to him. Well, okay, give him a few hours for his antibiotics to kick in. And you should go back to bed until Big Jim comes back with your dose. Dodee, don't go. He's hallucinating. It's one of the later symptoms of meningitis. It's a good thing that you brought him in when you did. Go back to bed. BIG JIM: What the hell? Damn it! Whoever did this took everything. How many are we up to? At least 30 
with advanced symptoms. Another two dozen with early signs. Any news from Big Jim? Not yet. Honey, you don't look well. Are you sure you haven't caught... We got vaccinated, remember? When we took that safari to Africa. I took my insulin without eating. How much do you have left? Can we please talk about this later? How much? Definitely a few days' worth. Okay. I'm gonna get you something to eat, and you're gonna eat it. (sighs) WOMAN: Dr. Calvert! (monitor beeping rapidly, Linda shivering) Linda's temp's 104 and Mrs. Moore's BP's falling. How much antibiotic do we have left? One dose. (beeping continues) MOORE: Give Linda the medicine. I'll wait till the next round. There's no way I'm gonna take it. Go ahead, give Linda the dose. (shivering) (siren wailing) MAN (over radio): Uh, medical, this is Rescue One. You need to let me out. Sorry. Orders from my dad. Nobody leaves until we get this thing under control. 
 
 Junior? James? You don't understand. I think that my husband might be in trouble. How? (people coughing in distance) What... (sighs) All I know is that Phil said that he was meeting Peter in a cabin. Like the one I found Barbie at? What are you talking about? A few days ago, I followed Barbie to this cabin. Uh, end of Sparrow's Lane. You need to let me out. I wish I could, but... I can't. (sign buzzing) (monitor beeping) (scanner beeps) BARBIE:  Well, at least whoever took all that medicine couldn't have gotten far. Because of the dome? Yeah. And with a haul that size, there's no way they're getting away on foot. So we're looking for a truck or a van. Or a hearse. What, your reverend? The hell would he be doing with drugs? Nothing good. His wrath burns like fire. The hell are you doing? Honoring his plan. When I heard folks got sick, I broke into Dee's Pharmacy... What are you, insane?! People will die without that medicine! Those people are supposed to die. It's God's plan. Trust me. He's the only one who decides who lives and dies under his dome. And there's nothing you can do about it. Unload the car. (monitor beeping steadily) (groans softly) (sighs) What's happening? They gave you antibiotics. You should be on the mend soon. And how are you feeling? I've been better. If you told me yesterday that the idea of Junior Rennie brandishing a shotgun would be reassuring... (chuckles) ...I'd have laughed my head off. Actually, I might have said that about you a few years ago. Wasn't exactly the teacher's pet, was I? With that mouth of yours? (chuckles) 
Lord, no. But now look at you. The town sheriff. I've had a lot of help, though. Especially from Duke Perkins. May he rest in peace. But don't sell yourself short. (exhales softly) Mrs. Moore? (monitor flatlines) Mrs. Moore? Help! We need help in here! She's coding. Starting chest compressions. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12... I was just talking to her. (door creaks) (indistinct chatter) OLLIE: Out of the way, Junior! MAN: You have no right to keep us here. OLLIE: You can't stop all of us with that gun. Step back. WOMAN: Whoa! MAN: Hey, hey, hey. (chair clatters) Let's go. (gunshot) (clamoring) Junior. (panting) Mr. Densmore... you remember when my mother died? And your wife, she made that amazing corn bread. From your own field, she said. Even gave me the skillet. I remember. Now I'm in here... with you, with this. Not to point a gun at you. But because I live here and I'm one of you. We've got to fight through this thing together and trust that we're all in here for a reason. I believe in this town. I believe in my dad. And I believe in you. (door closes) (drawer squeaks) (quietly): Oh, Peter. (exhales) (panting) (camera clicking) This is all I could scrounge up. It's a zoo out there. Thanks. So what are we gonna do when we run out of, like, peanut butter and jelly and bread? What are we gonna eat? We'll get out before then. All right, so, I was thinking... our seizures. The last time one happened was after we touched. Yeah, could've been a coincidence. Both of us? At the same exact time? (chuckles) What if we triggered it? Okay, how would that happen? I don't know, but... we should test it. Like... touch again? Yeah. Unless, you know, you're scared. No, I'm not scared. We should film it. Here. Get on the floor. All right. But if you pee your pants, just know there will be video evidence. JOE: Same goes for you. (sighs) You ready? Let's do it. Okay. I feel stupid. (electrical crackle) (horn honking) Got the antibiotics. MAN: Bring it straight on in to the charge nurse. Any problems in there? Not at all. (shouts) (crying) Help! Junior! (panting) So, where's Julia? Not a clue, man. I barely know where I am. (quietly): What did you tell her? (exhales) What did she ask you? It's all kind of blurry, but I think it was something about her husband. Relax, it's not like he's gonna say anything about you. He's gone. What do you mean, he's gone? Gone like gone. Like "Adios, Peter Shumway." (grunts) (exhales, sighs) About a month ago, he came to me asking if I knew any hit men. Whoa... He asked you about hit men? I know. Right? And I told him that crap was only in the movies. He was in a bad way. He sold me his car for a steal. I told him if things were that bad, he should take the cash and buy the first bus ticket out of here and start over. Sorry, man. I don't know how much he owed you. (chuckles) You ain't getting that cash back. And how much of this did you tell her? It's tough to say. I... I was pretty out of it. (pats shoulder) Peter? (panting) Hey there, Red. (panting) Why didn't you tell me? I'll tell you soon. Norrie. Wake up. You feel anything? I don't remember. Let's check out the video. I'll rewind it. (beeping) Here we go. NORRIE: Okay. I feel stupid. (electrical crackle) BOTH: The pink stars are falling. The pink stars are falling in lines. Pink stars? I don't get it. Shh... Do you remember doing that? No. No way. What does this mean? I don't know. Maybe we're not supposed to tell anyone. Why not? JOE: Norrie. Wake up. 'Cause the dome doesn't want us to. NORRIE: What happened? JOE: You feel anything? Hey. Have you seen Julia? JUNIOR: Why? Did she wise up and ditch you? She needs antibiotics. When's the last time you saw her? Couple hours ago. She kept asking about a cabin. What'd you tell her? I just mentioned the place I saw you a couple days ago. Give me the keys to your truck. No. Hey. Now, she left on your watch. She's sick and she will die out there, so give me the keys to your truck. Peter... (panting) (shivering) All right. You were a brave little girl back there. Okay. Get home and get better. She's good. Oh. Well, well, well. Look who came back from the dead. I heard you saved the day. Well, that's what I do. Well, your son takes after you, too. Oh, yeah? He stopped what could have been a full-blown riot. People were freaking out, and he talked them down. Chip off the old block. You ever consider a career in law enforcement? Was that you? Was that me what? Was that you who saved my life? I learned about Peter in that cabin. We're broke; he emptied our accounts. And the house is in foreclosure. So, what were you all into? Drugs? (chuckles softly) When I got out of the military, I did, um... I had a bunch of odd jobs. Uh... was a line cook. Construction. (sighs) And then, um... then I linked up with a bookie... out of Westlake. Taking bets? Making sure the people paid what they owed. You're an enforcer. Guys like Phil owed... and they paid up, and most of the time, it's like that. Peter never gambled. PETER (recorded): I've got the cash, but my wife's home. Meet me at the other spot. It's his voice mail from five days ago. So, where is he now? Please. I have to know. He must have taken off. You know, that happens sometimes. Some of these guys, they get in so deep, and... you know, they skip town. I'm sorry. You're sorry? I let you stay in my house. I trusted you. Your sorry means nothing to me. When I get back home, you better be gone. NORRIE: So, is the outbreak over? Well, everyone who's sick has been treated, and anyone exposed to meningitis... got antibiotics. So yes, it's over. How do you guys feel? Any more seizures? No. We're fine. What have you two been doing all day? Oh, you know, just making out and stuff. ALICE: Right. It's the "stuff" that usually worries us. (sighs) 
I am beat. Can we go home, please? NORRIE: Home? It's a room above a diner. You have any better ideas, kiddo? Well, I do. I mean, both my parents are outside the dome, and there's more than enough room at my house. It's just me, so... you guys could stay there. Please don't say no. Please? Thanks, Joe. That'd be great. CAROLYN: I'll grab our stuff and meet you in the car. ♪ Babe, what are you doing? Are you stealing insulin? You yourself said you only had a week's supply left. Alice, look what happened today. We almost ran out of antibiotics for everyone. What happens when  we  run out? Okay, what's going on? You're not acting like yourself. I-I'm scared. What if the dome lasts forever? It won't. We will get out of here. Soon. I promise. You sure you'll be okay? Yeah. Thanks for the ride. Yeah. (sighs) It's not your fault, you know. What isn't? Mrs. Moore. She died saving my life. She knew how important you are to this town. To all of us. I'm not the only one. What you did today saved a lot of lives. The way you did it. Duke always said the greatest weapon we have as police is a good heart. Mrs. Moore was right. About what? We  have  come a long way. (quiet creaking) (doorknob rattles) (quiet creaking continues) If you came here to apologize, don't bother. I have nothing to apologize for. I came... to give you this. My share of the profits. Keep all the propane. I'm gonna wash my hands of our dirty little business. (laughs) Little late for that, Lester. Never too late to repent. You think you've saved this town, but you've damned them. You defied God's will. And for that, you'll pay. You're lucky I didn't haul your ass into jail for what you did today. Luck has nothing to do with it. You can't hurt me without hurting yourself. God bless. (door creaks) (shivering) (panting) (gasps) (grunts) (gasps) Help! (sobbing): Help...! Help! (Angie screaming faintly in distance) (clattering in distance) (distant screaming continues) (crickets chirping) (door creaks)
