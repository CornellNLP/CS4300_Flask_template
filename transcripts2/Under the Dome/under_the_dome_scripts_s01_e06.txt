 JULIA:  Chester's Mill is a place like any other. 
 At least it used to be, until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome. (cows bellowing) Invisible, indestructible, inescapable. We're trapped. JULIA:  We don't know where it came from or why it's here,  but now that we're all trapped  under the dome together, none of our secrets are safe. I know, Junior. What are you talking about? About Angie. Hello? (gasps) (gun cocks) Nobody's gonna follow you anywhere, ever, when they hear just exactly who you are. The military plans to launch a powerful missile in the hopes of destroying the dome. All right, everybody, stay put, and remain calm! (explosion rumbling) I can't believe it. The dome's still here. Good thing they evacuated everyone outside. Hey, you guys okay? We saw the missile hit the dome. (electrical crackling) Didn't even put a dent in it. GRINNELL: What's it made of if a bomb couldn't blow it up? She's right. How is that possible? I don't know. Nothing about this thing makes any sense. You can say that again. Still smooth as a baby's butt. BIG JIM: Stay back! Stay back, everyone! Remember Sheriff Perkins. Touching that thing exploded his damn pacemaker. Norrie? Mom! Honey, honey. Oh, God, are you okay? I'm sorry I ran off. Oh. If anything had happened to you... Linda? Where are your deputies? Well, who do you think I'm trying to find? Have you seen Junior? He didn't evacuate to the factory with everyone else. Yeah, I'm looking for him myself, but he's a big boy. He can handle himself. I wish I could say the same for Reverend Coggins. Carter found his body by the dome where we had Visitors' Day. Good Lord. Coggins is dead? His hearing aid exploded. He must have touched the dome, and it just fried him. OLLIE: First Duke, now the Reverend? Well, how many more of us is this thing gonna kill? Just take it easy, Ollie. You're scaring people, okay? Well, it's a little too late for that now. We've got a right to know what's going on. We've all banded together before, and we survived, okay? GRINNELL: Yeah, until we run out of food in here. How about electricity? I'm nearly out of propane. Hell, I ran out yesterday. Been warming up canned soup in my fireplace. I suggest we take this to a town hall meeting. We... What, so you can keep jawing while more people die? Hey, my jawing's gotten us through plenty, Ollie. Now, why don't you help by keeping your damn head on straight? Can we please just get out of here? Yeah, before a fight breaks out. It's, like, a hundred degrees today. Let's get back to the car. Joe, you can come with us. Honestly, I'm a little scared. What happens when we run out of everything? What do we do then? I don't know. (loud electrical shriek) The walkies aren't working. (high-pitched beeping) I can't get a frequency. (static crackling) 
Hey, Barbie, till I can reach my deputies... I'm gonna need another hand. I'll help you, but I don't need your badge. Come on, I'll give you a lift into town. We can talk about how this will work. JULIA: I'm gonna head over to the radio station. See if they're picking anything up from the outside. I'll see you later? Yeah. Okay. OLLIE: You know what this means, folks? We're never getting out of here. Ollie, at least you have a farm to feed yourself. (siren whoops) 
What about the rest of us? BIG JIM: You have my word, people! No one's gonna starve in Chester's Mill. It's crazy. Five minutes ago, I thought we were gonna die. It's worse not knowing what's next. You don't need to be scared, Angie. Didn't you notice I'm a deputy now? People trust me, just like you should. Whatever happens, I'll take care of you. (grunting) Angie, don't do this! Angie! (groans) Angie! ALICE: Just let me out of the car. Let me out of the car. (panting) Why'd you make me stop? What's wrong? I just... I need some air. It's boiling hot in there. Mom, are you okay? She-She's fine. Alice, just get back in the car. I'll blast the AC. What time's our flight? What flight? To L.A. I don't want to miss it. NORRIE: Mom, watch out! (horn blaring, brakes squealing) Oh, my God! Are you okay? (groans) (siren whoops) Is everybody okay? What happened? Alice didn't see the truck coming. The driver swerved and hit the tower. Joe and Norrie pulled him out just in time. Hey. Oh, got him. Good job, you guys. The pipe's a goner. Where's your tower get its water from? Lake Eastpointe. It's our main source. All right, well, we'll haul water from there. In the meantime, we should check it out. Okay, look-look at me, look at me. Alice, when's the last time you took your insulin? I ran out. With the bomb craziness and everything, I just... I lost track. Come on, we got to get you to the clinic right now. Okay? What's wrong with your mom? She's a diabetic. Kind of loses it when she forgets to take her insulin. (high-pitched beep, static crackling) (eerie whirring, high-pitched squealing) What is that noise? I don't know, but it's jamming our broadcast. Kind of sounds like the alien from  Aliens. Well, all the police walkies are making the same sound. Is Dodee picking up any military chatter from outside the dome? Oh, screech is jamming that, too. And if it's this loud, then the source is probably close. How close? Best guess? Mile or two. So it's inside Chester's Mill? (static stops) (sighs) (sighs) Listen, if it's that close, maybe we can find it. DODEE: One step ahead of you, Julia. Do I even want to know what that is? Us radio heads call it a "yagi". I rigged it to locate the source of the screech using frequency triangulation. Look, whatever this screech is, it can't be a coincidence that it started just as the missile was about to hit the dome. You think the dome was trying to scream? Or protect itself. DODEE: Who knows? But if it was, it might be what's generating the dome itself. We just have to follow the signal to the power source. Well, if that's true, then if we can track it down... Maybe we can turn it off. It's none of my business, but you're lucky to have her. Her? I have eyes, you know. Oh, Julia and I aren't exactly an item. Well, from the sparks that I saw flying, you should be. I'd kill to have Rusty back right now. How long you two been together? Three years. We're supposed to get married next month. But now it just seems like some dream I made up. What the hell? You can't be out. I was just here the other day. You had insulin. We have 23 diabetics in Chester's Mill. Our insulin supply is gone. Pharmacy has to have some. When Reverend Coggins ransacked the place, he took all of the drugs, including the insulin. What are we supposed to do? Pray. Jim, we have a situation. The water tower... Yeah, I know; it fell. We'll just have to get our water from Lake Eastpointe. Can't. What are you doing? This is the water from the lake. It's polluted with methane. Must've cut through an underground mineral pocket when the dome came down. So it's undrinkable. Yeah, until we figure out how to filter it. What about rain? Is that dome high enough for storm clouds to form? I have no idea. You know, not too many people take the time to get to know their town. A shame, really. There's history here. Right in our own backyards. My grandfather gave me this map when I was a kid. I used to spend hours poring over it, learning the lay of the land. There are artesian wells underneath Chester's Mill. You know, some have dried up by now, but, uh... this one here is still flowing strongly. It's right under Ollie Densmore's place. And I'm guessing he owns the rights. We have to go see him. No, no, no, no. I've known Ollie long enough to know that he can be a pain in the ass, so... I'll go talk to him. Dad. Where you been? You okay? I can't find Angie. She's gone. Was she with you when the bomb went off? Yeah, but she... got away. Well, then find her. If she opens her mouth about being locked up... Wait. Wait a minute. Now, I've been looking for her. Besides, you're the one who let her go. Damn it. Don't you put this on me, Junior. This is your mess. And right now, I got one of my own. So for once in your life, do your own damage control. Get out there and find that girl. Hey, so how long has Big Jim known Ollie Densmore? Way Duke told it, all their lives. Jim and Ollie would be friends one day and then enemies the next. They'd patch it up over a burger at Sweetbriar, but... they'd be fighting about something new the following week. 
(crowd clamoring) And speaking of fighting, we should probably check this out. (clamoring continues) Folks, listen, I'm sorry, but the only payment I can accept is either propane or batteries. MAN: So our money's no good now? I mean, we got cash. And we've been waiting out here forever. Terry, what's going on here? I'm just trying to explain the new reality to these people. Look, I can't feed my family with money no one's gonna take. MAN: New reality? Sounds like a scam to me. I'm not trying to... Hey, come on, guys, come on. Is it true the lake is ruined? I hear we're gonna run out of water. Yeah, if we haven't already. Starting a panic is not gonna help anyone. All right? So, does anybody here have batteries that we can loan to Dres? Anybody? Thank you. There's no need for alarm. I'm sorry for making a scene. Thank you, Sheriff. BARBIE: You really believe that? No need for alarm? Rule number one of law enforcement: you always believe in the goodness of people you serve. That's what Duke taught me on the first day of the job. Yeah, and if they prove you wrong? Rule number two... ...you do what you got to do. That's not a good idea. Why? I mean, didn't you have a gun when you chased after Randolph? Yeah, but Randolph killed Freddy. These people... (crowd clamoring in distance) ...these people are scared. (clamoring continues) To tell you the truth... so am I. Ollie! Hey! Won't take up too much of your time. All the time in the world for you, Big Jim. We got a water problem. That concerns me, uh... how? You got a well, and the people of Chester's Mill could really use your help. What's in it for me? How about a sense of civic pride? That's typical. You always take me for granted, Jim. All us farmers. Till now. You still sore the town council took Kip Lester's side on that fence dispute? That so-called "fence dispute" lost me seven acres of my farm. That was 15 years ago, Ollie. Well, that's a drop in the bucket compared to how long you and me go back. I figured I could've counted on you. You know the law tied my hands on that. Like that's stopped you before now. Damn it, be reasonable, Ollie. That's exactly what I'm being. You want my water, you'll have to pay for it. Today at the dome, you were talking about running low on propane. You know, the propane it takes to run your irrigation system and light your house. L-Let me guess. You have some. Plenty. 
(chuckles) Why am I not surprised Big Jim Rennie just happens to have what Chester's Mill needs in its moment of crisis? It's nothing sinister, Ollie. Town keeps a reserve in case of emergency. (engine starts) You get me propane, town gets its water. CARTER: Just in time. Things getting out of control? Not yet, but the mood's pretty ugly. Barbie, get inside and keep peace at the register. Carter, slow the flow of people going inside. (crowd clamoring) Junior! Where have you been all morning? Sorry, Linda, I got a situation I need to take care of. I'm looking for someone. Well, I need you to do your job. MAN: You can let more people in your store. Come on! Ladies and gentlemen, due to demand, we are now limiting each customer's purchase to a total of two liters of water. Work the aisles. Just keep smiling, and... stay alert. JUNIOR: Waylon, Clint, put it back. Isn't this cute; little Big Jim playing cop. Drop those and step back. Or what? You gonna teach us a lesson? If I have to. Hey, uh, come on. Are you serious? Hey! I was here first! Ida... My son is sick; I need this! I don't care! Hey, hey, come on, ladies. (women arguing) Hey, knock it off. Knock it off. Joe, what am I going to do? I can't just let my mom die. Not like this. Tell me how to help. I'll do anything. Wh-Where are you going? The nurse said that there's a bunch of other diabetics in town. Their files have to be in here somewhere. Okay, you think people are just gonna give you their insulin if you ask? Who said I was gonna ask? N-Norrie... If you don't like it, don't come. (sighs) 
 
 JULIA:  Are we getting closer to the signal? (slow, steady beeping) 
No. What? Our source-- all of a sudden, it's moving. What kind of a power source moves? I'm not sure. (slow beeping continues) (sighs): All right, well... let's see if we can hone in on it. (crowd clamoring) Get out of the way! MAN: We're running out of water! (clamoring continues) MAN: Let people in! We need water! Angie! Where have you been? Rose! (panting) Are you okay? 
(crying) (panting): Junior, he... What? Junior what? The day that the dome came down, Junior locked me in his fallout shelter. (whispers): What?! I tried to escape, but I couldn't. And then Big Jim found me. And he let you out. No. He locked me in again. Big Jim did? And the only reason he let me out this morning is because... he thought this missile was gonna kill us all. I can't believe Big Jim would do something like that. Rose, I'm not lying. When he finally let me out, I... I ran. I ran and I ran to my parents' house. (sobbing): I couldn't find Joe. Oh... I couldn't find my brother! Oh. Your brother is safe. And so are you. (sniffles) But Junior's a cop now. And his dad's a councilman. Who's gonna believe my word against theirs? I do. I do. Don't you worry, honey, 'cause we'll make sure that everybody else does, too. Are you sure a diabetic lives here? Yeah. Name's on the medical files I pulled. Ray Garcia. 341 Cupidas Drive. Yeah, well, no one's home. (sighs) Can we come back later? Joe, we don't want them to be home. Plus, maybe they got caught outside the dome. Wait, wait, Norrie, we-we can't just... (shotgun racks) What are you kids doing? My mom needs insulin. So you figured you'd steal mine? She's... she's gonna die. Just like the rest of us. I took my last dose yesterday. Now, go on. Get out of here before I blow your damn heads off. (crowd clamoring) 
They're gonna run out of food! Let's go! Back up! Move! Can't wait any longer! Let's go! No, no, no, no! Hey, hey, hey, come on, stop! Hey! Stop! Let her go! No! Get your hands off! Hey! Get your hands off that woman! Go to hell! (grunts) Move it! Move it! (panting) (muffled grunting) LINDA: Barbie! Barbie... get ahold of yourself. (clamoring continues in distance) Can I count on you? (panting): It won't happen again. (glass shatters in distance) All right, this thing is starting to spread. We need to do something, and fast. Carter, come with me. (glass shattering in distance) (clamoring continues outside) (loud banging, glass shattering) What the hell do you think you're doing? We know that you still got meat in that freezer of yours. Yeah. And it doesn't belong to either of you. You don't get it, Rose. We're stuck in here with no water. Food's running out. A bomb couldn't even crack that damn thing. So we're just gonna take what we want. Right after you kiss my ass! (Rose grunts) 
Rose! (bat thumps, Rose grunts) Rose! Rose! (Angie yelling) You b*st*rd! (Angie screams) (siren wailing) (tires screech) Where have you been? At the station. I remembered Duke telling me about some riot gear the Feds sent us after 9/11. This is it? This stuff's... it's ten years old-- it loses effectiveness. Get ready to clear the crowd. (crowd clamoring, glass shattering) MAN: Move out of the way! Look out! Run! (people coughing) BARBIE: The tear gas isn't working. It's not stopping them. (clamoring continues) (glass shatters) DODEE:  Slow down, slow down. Damn it! Now what? I lost the signal. (sighs): How? I don't know. Just-just give me a second. Wait, wait, wait, it's back. Hurry, hurry, go. Okay. We're close. All right. Door's unlocked-- it's not like we're breaking in. Now say it like you mean it. Nore? What are you doing here? We were just... um... Where are your parents? Mom went to the store. Dad can't get back home with that dome thing outside. We're not gonna hurt you. I'm not scared. Mom says I'm not a little boy anymore. I even do my own shots now. You have diabetes? Yeah, but it's not a big deal. Take these back to the fridge. Wait. WOMAN: What the hell are you doing here? Get out! I'm sorry. That was a stupid idea. You were right. Let's just go back to your mom's. JULIA: Hey, Joe! What are you guys doing here? Uh... we were just... Out on a walk. What are you guys doing? (rapid beeping) 
Wild goose hunt. Not anymore. The signal's coming from right here. (rapid beeping continues) From this house? I think it's coming from them. What's this? It's my end of the deal. Got what you want, Ollie. So be prepared for town folk to start coming over, getting their water. 
(laughs) Well, it's a good start, anyway. Need another delivery about a week from now. You know, I could always seize that well, you backwoods son of a bitch. And I'm sure you'd find some bylaw or loophole to justify doing it. I mean, that's always been the Big Jim way, hasn't it? But not anymore. What's that supposed to mean? It means I don't give a rat's ass what piece of official paper you pull out. You step foot on my land except to bring me more propane, you'll get a bullet between the eyes. I always could shoot better than you. Be careful, Ollie. Times like this, you don't want to stand alone. Cross me. We'll see who stands where. (laughs) Yeah, Junior's girl really put up a fight. She can't now. (clamoring continues outside) Go watch the door, Clint. Angie McAlister. I don't think you're gonna mind. (clamoring continues outside) (glass shatters in distance) JOE: Wait, this is  our  fault? So you think  we're  what's jamming all the frequencies in town? All we know is, whatever this signal thing is, it started today and it led us straight to you guys. Yeah, but why today? I mean, it's not like we did anything. I know it doesn't make any sense. It sort of does. We have to tell someone. DODEE: Tell us what? The day the dome came down... we both started having seizures. All the people who've seen us seize... have said that we said something. The exact same thing. Okay, I'm officially freaked out. H-Here. (sniffs) BOTH: The pink stars are falling in lines. The pink stars are falling. The pink stars are falling. The pink stars are falling in lines. The pink stars are falling. The pink stars are falling. The pink stars are fall... (clamoring continues) BARBIE: Hey! Break it up! CLINT: Sorry, man, diner's closed. When did Rose make you the doorman? (chuckles) Rose? Yeah. Waylon! Get out of there! Hey! (strained grunting) (weak groaning) (whimpers weakly) (panting) (Waylon coughing) (panting) (glass shatters in distance) What happened? Rose is dead. Rose? Oh, my God. I need your keys. I got to get her to the clinic. LINDA: Damn it. Someone slashed the tires. It's time for rule number two. Stop. Stop! (thunder crashes) (clamoring stops) (thunder rumbling) (horn honking) MAN: It can rain! It can rain inside the dome! (crowd whooping, cheering) All right! Don't just stand there, folks, grab a bucket, grab a trash can! We need to save every drop we can! Now, come on! Hey, I got to get her to the clinic. Can you take her? Of course! Is that Angie McAlister? What happened? BARBIE: Looters. They broke in to the diner, they knocked her out. And Rose... What about Rose? She's dead. These two guys. One kept calling the other one... Waylon? Sounds like the Dundee brothers. Find them. (thunder crashes) (thunder crashes) (electrical crackling) Dome's still here. Outside it's totally dry. How is it only raining in here? The dome must have its own microclimate. The water from the lake evaporates, but the dome traps it inside. But the beautiful thing about the evaporation process is it filters the water so you can drink it. Guess we're not gonna run out of water after all. Yeah, great. So now we can spend the rest of our lives inside this damn thing. (electrical crackle) 
Whoa! (song playing over radio) Radio's working again. Whatever was jamming the airwaves is gone. (song continues) That's because Joe and Norrie touched the dome together. What the hell does that mean? Don't look at me. You know what, I don't have time for this. I've got to get to my mom. I'll drive you. No. The clinic's not far. I'll walk. You come with. (song continues over radio) They're connected to it. It's like the dome is... using them. Okay. How? I don't know yet. We could have died today in that missile strike. And instead, the dome ended up protecting us. And just when we need water... it rains. I mean, this can't just be a coincidence. Okay, so what, now the dome's helping us? Maybe. Maybe it's trying to reassure us. First it traps us... now it's trying to reassure us. No. No, there's nothing warm and fuzzy about this, Julia. And we need to tell someone about  them. Big Jim's gonna know what to do. Do you have any idea what will happen if word gets out about those kids? The whole town will be after them. Until we know what this is, we can't tell anyone. Fine. For now. (thunder crashes) (thunder crashes) (steady beeping) (thunder crashes) (monitor continues beeping steadily) CAROLYN: I don't know how you guys came up with this... ...but I'm glad you did. When she needs her next dose? Let's just be happy she's better for now. (whispers): Okay. ♪ (horn honks twice) Barbie. I've been looking for you. You okay? Yeah. You okay? Yeah. It's, uh... it's been a hell of a crazy day. Yeah, I guess you could say everybody went a little crazy today. We're gonna be okay. (thunder crashes) (thunder crashes) (thunder crashes) (groans weakly) (exhales) (quiet whistling) (weakly): Hello? BIG JIM: I'd take it easy if I were you. (gasps) (groans) (panting): What... What is going on? Barbie found you knocked out in the diner. Rose... (groans): She needs help. I'm, uh, I'm afraid it's too late. She was a good friend to me. What... What am I doing here? You can't lock me up again. No, no, the front door's open; you can leave anytime you like. Though I was hoping... that you and I could... come to an arrangement. Junior kidnapped me. No amount of money can pay for that. You'll get no argument from me. You know, deep down... I think I always knew something was off... with my son. Ever since his mom died. I guess I just... couldn't admit it to myself. So I'm not talking about giving you money. I'm offering you my word. Your word? Junior Rennie will never touch you again; I'll make sure of it. And, uh, well, I mean, if... if you  need  money... or... what counts as money in town these days-- you know, propane, food, water, a gun-- well, you'll have it. If you will just try to put this terrible event behind you... ...I'll get you anything your little heart desires. What about Joe? I need to know that my brother will be taken care of, too. Done. We can be friends. And, uh... trust me, times like these, it's good to have a friend like... Big Jim Rennie. I don't know. I have to think about it. (door opens) Dad. Angie. What's going on here?
