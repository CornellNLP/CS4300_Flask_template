 Two weeks ago,  an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world. 
 Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead, we still don't know. Every day it tests our limits,  bringing out the best   and the worst in us. Some say we'll be stuck here forever, to find a way out. Do you think this is where Lyle disappeared to? It's a tunnel. PAULINE:  James? I expect you know that I'm alive. Your mother told you to trust Lyle? You mean before she died? Two days ago, she sent me an e-mail. She's alive. She's out there somewhere. I saw that in my dream. I've seen it, too. It's in my hometown. Zenith. That's the same that town I'm from. You keep saying you're on my side, but it sure as hell seems like you turned on me. You killed the 19-year-old girl that your nephew loved! I had to! Everything Pauline put in her journal has come true. It says in here that if those four kids die, the dome comes down! You're not even gonna touch those kids. Sam! (gasps) Hey. Bad dream? Sam jumping off the cliff. You couldn't stop him. It's what he said before he jumped. That he admitted to killing Angie? He said a lot of things. He's crazy. I mean, he thought his dead sister's drawings of Angie and the hands were some kind of message. If he killed them, the dome would come down. You need to get some sleep. I don't think I can. Well, in the morning, we're gonna have to tell Junior and Joe. Good morning. Um... I guess I fell asleep. It's okay. You were tired. Aren't you? Knowing Lyle's out there wanting to kill us kept me awake. You stayed up to keep us safe? It wasn't hard. Not with Joe snoring like an elephant in heat. I heard that. Did the egg do anything else last night? Uh, not since it showed us the obelisk from Zenith. Which is so weird. Why would it show us something from my hometown? Your hometown is Barbie's hometown. That has to mean something. (car doors closing outside) Shh! Someone's coming. Whoa! Friendlies. Barbie. You made it out of the cave-in. And you're all right. You found the egg. In the lake. Where you said it would be. When we were all together, it floated to the surface. Like... it needed to be with us. You have to keep it safe. I will. We have to talk about Sam. Why? Is my uncle okay? He's dead, Junior. What? What happened? Yesterday, when you went into the tunnels with Sam to find Lyle, it was because we thought Lyle killed Angie. Except he didn't. Sam did. No. You're lying. I saw the scratches that she left on him. And once I knew, he jumped off of a cliff at the end of the tunnel. No, no. That-that's not true. I'm sorry, Junior. I'm just supposed to believe you? You don't know my uncle. You going after him, too? No. We need to get Sam's body. The only real evidence that we have are those scratches that Angie left on him. And until Junior and the whole town sees that, we're not gonna put this behind us. BIG JIM: It looks like you lived to see another day. Jim. You gonna tell me what you're doing, or are you just gonna keep me guessing? Come on, Barbie. You know I'm gonna find out one way or another. Look, the whole reason I got into trouble in the first place yesterday is that I wasn't fully equipped to explore the tunnels. So, I figured I'd go back and do it right and see what I see. You're gonna tell me what you find? Oh, yeah. Yeah, you'll be the first to know. JULIA: Where'd it go? Disappears in the darkness. It's the same thing that happened to Sam. I didn't hear it land. How's that possible? Same way the dome's possible. Got any ideas to help us understand where that cliff might lead to? REBECCA: No, I don't understand it. This laser pointer never reaches the far side. And even stranger, my compass is spinning. Says we're facing every direction at once. I don't like this. Me, neither, but you saw Junior's reaction. He's not gonna believe that Sam killed Angie till he sees that body himself. Scratches and all. Promise me you'll be careful. Of course I will. All right. Be right back. What do you see? (laughs) I see a whole lot of dark. Describe the rock face. Any vegetation? Nope. It's dead as a doornail. Got to be 20 feet down by now. Can you see the bottom? No! But the darkness... I think I'm... getting closer to it. (grunting loudly) Whoa! Whoa! Hey! You guys messing with the rope? No, we didn't touch it! All right, well, something just pulled me! Barbie, come up. (grunts loudly) Oh, my God! The anchor's coming loose! Barbie! Hey! (yells) Barbie! (grunting) Rebecca! Barbie, I've got the rope! You need to climb! Julia, let go! (grunting) Julia! Julia, let go of the rope! The hell I will! Julia, I can't hold it! (grunts) If we don't let go, we'll go over, too! Julia! Barbie... don't you dare. I got you. I love you, Julia. I can pull you up! (screaming): No! Barbie, can you hear me?! Barbie, say something! Julia. Barbie? Julia. Barbie, say something, damn you! Barbie! (sobbing) Come on, come on, come on, come on. Say something! Okay. Do you think he did it? Sam? You knew my uncle back when you were... alive before. Do you think he's capable of murder? The Sam I used to know was sweet and kind and always smiling. But now I don't know. There's something so much darker in him. What do you think? I trusted him. How could my own uncle murder Angie? Did I hear you right? Sam murdered Angie? Who told you this? Barbie. He found out when they were down in the tunnels. And then Sam killed himself. So Barbie told you. I'm sorry, son. Are you? I'll be downstairs. Look, I know this is tough to hear, son. But your uncle was always... He was off. It's why we didn't get along. The truth is he was never as strong as you and I. And this town needs strength. It needs us. Well, right now, I don't care what the town needs. Well, you need to. Now more than ever. We're special, Junior. The dome chose me. And you're my son... No, no, no. I'm done listening to this. Junior, Junior. Junior, please listen to me. Why do you always have to make everything about you? Angie loved this. I know. She's never coming back. And you're at peace with it? I'll never be at peace with it. But I have to accept it. You're staring into that thing like it's a crystal ball or something. It's got me thinking about the dome. Something isn't adding up. Does anything add up anymore? There was never a tunnel down there. And now there is. What's your point, Joe? My point is... where did it come from? And why is it here? We should go back in there. No. I-I am sorry, okay? But we called for him. There wasn't any answer. There's just no way he could survive a fall like that. Okay, come on. Why don't you lie down, huh? There's a couch in my shop room. Rebecca, no one can know. What? Just until I can tell them. I just need to figure it out first. You're worried about Big Jim. Without Barbie, there's no telling what he'll do. I'll follow your lead, okay? Now, come on. BIG JIM: There you are. Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? About Sam. I had to hear it from Junior. He was devastated. What do you want, Jim? Well, I want to talk to Barbie. Where is he? He's... Bringing up Sam's body. Ah, well, I'll give him a hand. Um, the tunnel's not safe. Could collapse at any moment. Rebecca made me come up, too. Oh. What's wrong, Julia? Are you upset? No. No, it's just the dust. Like she said, it's bad down there. And only Barbie is equipped to get through it. He, uh, wanted to ask if maybe you would go down to the police station. In case any calls came in. Of course, any-anything I can do to be of service. (dog barking nearby) (girls laughing) ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ Can I help you? I'm looking for Pauline Verdreaux. And you are? Her brother, Sam Verdreaux. I'll get someone to take you up. "Take me up"? Your sister's in the locked ward. Barbie's gone? Does that mean he's dead? Oh, my God. What happened? He cut the rope on purpose. But why? To save Rebecca and me from going over the cliff. I don't believe it, Julia. The dome wouldn't let anything happen to Barbie. It went crazy when Big Jim tried to hang him, right? And now a tunnel appears that wasn't here three weeks ago? What do you mean it wasn't there three weeks ago? I lived in Chester's Mill my entire life. The basement underneath this school has always just been... a basement. And then a tunnel appears? What if the dome dug it? And that tunnel and that cliff and Barbie going down there was all part of the dome's plan? A plan for what? I don't know. But we can find out. If we go over that cliff ourselves. I would never let you do that. I don't mean us. Then what do you mean? I was president of the school's Robotics Club, and we made stuff that might help us find exactly what's at the bottom of that cliff. Okay. Okay. Meet me at the locker in a half hour. I'll be right back. Has my sister been here long? Place like this? Time don't exactly mean much. She's in there. Thanks. Yeah. Uh, let me remind you, too, that this is your vision. This is... Oh, my God. Sam. Hi, sis. Oh... (crying) Uh... but... you were inside the dome. Did it come down? No. How'd you get out? I'm still trying to figure that out myself. And Junior... did he get out? Is he all right? He's still in Chester's Mill. He knows you're alive. He got your message. Oh, we have so much to talk about. Don't bother with that.  (gasps) (panting) 
 
 You know how nosy neighbors can be. And what we have to discuss is... no one's business but our own. Jim... what are you doing in here? You know, I... I blame myself, in part, for this. I trusted you. I never should've. What are you talking about? You made a huge mistake crossing me. Did I never mention... that the dome... saved me from death at those gallows? It redeemed me. It chose me... to do what it wants. And yet you couldn't see that, could you? Otherwise... you wouldn't have lied to me. I didn't lie to you. Yes, you did. (whimpers) Jim, you're scaring me. Well, maybe you should be scared. I don't know what you're talking about. I waited outside that school. I saw you leave... but Barbie? He never left. So where is he? And do not lie to me again. Ever. Barbie... Barbie's dead. (sighs) (exhales) Welcome home, Barbie. Been worried about you, Barbie. We've been staking out your apartment. Where you been hiding the last three weeks? Rick. You promised you were gonna go run a few errands for Maxine, then be back to do a job for me. Got sidetracked. You knew what we were gonna clear for that info on Aktaion Energy's R&D. It would've made us all rich. Well, you, anyway. But then you just up and vanished. Would you believe me if... I told you I was stuck under the dome? (men chuckle) (coughing) (grunts) You're gonna do the Aktaion job you said you would. At half the price. And if I say no? (groaning) You won't have enough teeth to form the word. No, it's okay! Okay! Just... give me a day to get organized, all right? I just got back. You'll go now. I still can't believe you got out. Makes two of us. How? We found these tunnels underneath the school. At the end of them, there was a cliff. And, um... I went over it. You jumped on purpose? No. It was dark. I fell. Anyway... all that matters is that I'm here. And found you. How come you didn't tell me that you were gonna fake your own death? Don't you trust me? (sighs) Of course I trust you. I didn't tell you because I don't trust myself. I don't understand. I knew the dome was coming down, even if Big Jim said I was crazy. But you weren't crazy. The dome did come down. Yeah. And I just thought if I left Chester's Mill, that the dome would follow me. And I was afraid to tell you about my plan, because then you'd prevent me from leaving. All right. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Any sane person would. Guess it's no shock Lyle believed me. Is that why you asked him for help? I sent him postcards over the years. I know it was wrong to use him that way, but I needed to stay in contact with someone. And I knew he wouldn't tell anyone. I did all this to save the town... you, my son. And I was wrong, and now... James is stuck in there. I guess anything is possible if you and Lyle could get out. What? Have you seen Lyle? Yes, I've seen him. He's here. How about now? JULIA: Hold on one sec. You see anything? Yeah, we've got picture, and it's recording. In just a second, it'll be showing us whatever's at the bottom of that cliff. NORRIE: Julia, are you sure you want to look? I want to see whatever's down there. No matter what. Here we go. (whirring) Okay, it's just passing 20 feet. NORRIE: It looks like... just rocks. Nothing else. Hey, we're losing picture. We shouldn't be. Joe, what's happening? I-I don't know. You better pull it back, Joe. Pull it back. I'm-I'm trying, but it won't come back up. I thought you said you knew how to fly it. I do! Damn it. We've lost the signal. I'm sorry, Julia. It's my own fault. When you guys started talking about tunnels, I just really wanted... I really wanted to believe there was a chance. We all did. Um, guys? You need to see this. I thought I saw something in that last bright flash and rewound the video. And it was a bright flash... so what? Unless you see it frame by frame. Right there. That looks like a slide. No, I think it's a playground. Where? I don't know. NORRIE: Oh, my God. The Obelisk. ♪ This is really the place? The owner of Aktaion Energy lives here. So shut your mouth, watch our six. (alarm wailing) What the hell? You double-crossing son of a bitch! Put down your weapon! Hey, hey, easy, easy, all right? I can explain all this. Dale? Is that you? Oh, my God, it is you. Hi, Dad. ♪ A drink? A beer, if you got one. Mm. How long's it been? Two years? Two and a half. Either way, entirely too long. Please, sit. No. I'll stand. (chuckles) Is it weird that I've missed your stubbornness? Reminds me of your mother. I'm happy to hear I remind anyone of her. So you gonna tell me why you hit the panic code and then took down the man that you were with? It doesn't matter. He's in cuffs. I don't suppose you're gonna tell me how you got those wounds either. I assume that you haven't come here to patch things up. You want something from me. A favor. LYLE: Melanie? Melanie? That's all he says, over and over again. The police found him in the middle of town, looking at the obelisk. Melanie. And they brought him here. Melanie? Melanie. Hey, Lyle? Melanie. Melanie. Lyle, can you hear me? Lyle. Melanie! He didn't recognize me either. That's all he does: eat, sleep and say "Melanie." And no one knows he was inside the dome? Melanie. No one even knows his name. He didn't have a wallet. Something must have happened to him when he went off that cliff. (sighs) But you're okay. That's true. Melanie? Melanie. There's only one... Melanie that I can think of he would be talking about. There-There's no way he's talking about her, right? Our Melanie? That was so long ago. There's something you should know. Melanie's alive. She came back from the dead. I need you to get me into the dome. You want me to get you to the dome? I need to get a message to somebody on the inside. Who? It doesn't matter. Obviously it does or you wouldn't be here. Dad, trust me, I wouldn't be asking you this if it wasn't important. Dale, the dome coming down is arguably the most significant event in history. The whole world is watching. The National Guard has established a ten-mile no-go zone around the perimeter. And the other half of that is-is a bombed-out wasteland. Yeah, but you've pulled strings before. But not like this. And I can't go to my friends in D.C. I mean, it's-it's not gonna work out. They're gonna think that I'm a fool. So this is about business. Don't start. No, you have not changed a damn bit. Everything I've done in business has been for our family. But you could never have seen that. If you did, you wouldn't have run off and joined the Army. I wouldn't have had to pull strings to bring you home from your deployment early. Look, I never asked you to do that. No. But your mother did. (sighs) (sighs) You think it's a coincidence... that she got sick right after you came home? She knew she was running out of time. She just... wanted to say good-bye. (exhales) Dad, I have never... asked you for anything. But I'm asking you now. Please... help me get to the dome. (sighs) Joe? Norrie? They've got to be here. We've looked everywhere else. Julia? Anyone? I don't like being here. Me neither. JOE: Hey! (Gasps) Joe? Where are you? JOE: I'm down here! You scared the hell out of us. We heard about Barbie. Is it true? Yeah, but i-it's all complicated. Is Julia down there? Yeah, she's down here. Is she okay? Yeah. Do you have the egg with you? Right here. Okay, perfect timing. Come on. We have to show you guys something. Let's go. Come on. (doorbell jingles) What are you doing? We're having a memorial. For Barbie. Shouldn't Julia be here? No one can find her. And I didn't want to wait, given Barbie's importance to this town. I'm sad that he's gone. I know at times we may have been enemies, but... often he was the only thing standing between this town and disaster. It's a real loss for everyone. And now it's time for all of us to come together. Around you. I think it's time for prayer. All right, folks. Let's gather round. And bow your heads. Oh, Heavenly Father, you've gotten us through dark times before, and we pray that you will get us through this one. I'm glad you decided to stay, Dale. Well, it's just for the night. And I guess I... owe you the truth. About? About why I want to get to the dome. I'm gonna go out on a limb. There's a woman inside it. The second that I saw you, I knew you weren't the same man that I knew two and a half years ago; I mean, you've changed, Dale. You... The way you hold yourself, the look in your eyes. That edge... you had from Iraq is gone. Now, I know there's only one thing that can do that. What's her name? Julia. And do you love her? Yeah. I love her. You understand that we would risk everything? I do. And you're willing to take that risk? Yeah, I am. All right. I'll help you get to the dome. Really? I understand what it feels like to be separated from the woman you love. Thank you, Dad. MELANIE: Julia. You really think Joe's onto something? I don't know. But I hope so. The egg. It's glowing again. JUNIOR: What's happening? What is this? It's Zenith. That's where the Obelisk is. Does that mean... That there could be a way out of the dome. Not just that. Barbie could be alive. If he found a way out, maybe he'll find a way back. ♪ In the swirling ♪
