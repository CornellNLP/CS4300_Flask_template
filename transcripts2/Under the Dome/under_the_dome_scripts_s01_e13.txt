 JULIA:  Chester's Mill is a place like any other. 
 At least it used to be until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome. (cows bellowing) Invisible, indestructible, and completely inescapable. We're trapped. JULIA:  We don't know where it came from or why it's here,  but now that we're all trapped  under the dome together, none of our secrets are safe. Dale Barbara stands accused of the attempted murder of Julia Shumway. And for the murders  of Maxine and Agatha Seagrave. I am not turning our town into a police state just because you say so. BIG JIM:  It's not me, Linda, it's the people. MAN: Sir, the ranking official is a James Rennie. One drone caught surveillance of this Rennie murdering the town reverend at the bridge roadblock. BIG JIM:  That dome can't come down. Not now. You're a sick b*st*rd. Everyone's gonna smile when you die. PHIL:  Why'd he do it? Barbie won't get away with it. BIG JIM: To the charges brought against you, how do you plead? Not guilty. NORRIE: It's the pink stars. What does it mean? JOE: The egg. We think it's the source that powers the whole dome. ANGIE:  Do you trust your dad? Of course I do. You didn't always. We all saw the same vision at the dome, Junior. Big Jim has to die. NORRIE: When the butterfly hatches... The monarch will be crowned. Hey, bud. We've been waiting on you. It's really happening. What's happening? Move away. Linda... Back away! How long have you guys known about this? What about you? Just a couple days, but, Linda, don't do anything rash. The kids-- they, they think the egg is the source. Source of what? The dome. It's the generator of the dome. NORRIE: We can sort of talk to it. It told us "the monarch will be crowned." What is that supposed to mean? JOE: We don't know yet. But that's a monarch butterfly. We think it's got to be important, so we have to get it out of there before it hurts itself. Or worse. I know how it all sounds. But I believe them. Not guilty? What, are you insane? You think this is some sort of game? (grunts) (coughs) You're the one rolling the dice here 'cause Julia's still out there somewhere. And she knows the truth. I already told people the truth. You killed Max, her mother, and her bodyguard. Nobody can change that now. We'll see. You entered your plea. Now you get your justice. ♪ Tell me! Why do you want me to kill my father? (grunts) Hey, take it easy, Julia. I appreciate everything that you've done, but I can't hide out down here. You are not safe out in the open. I'm the only one who can exonerate Barbie. Which is exactly why Big Jim will have you killed long before you can tell anyone. Then I'll die trying. (grunts) Angie, please. You don't have to come with me, but you can't stand in my way. (grunts) You don't know anything about this. I mean, it could be radioactive. The big dome isn't. Well, this doesn't belong to you. As of now, this is police property. What the hell? BARBIE:  You didn't think I was just gonna roll over, did you? Make this easy for you? No, nothing with you is easy. I know you're just gonna screw me in the end. You don't know any other way. But at least I can take you down with me. (chuckles) I don't think you understand what's happening here. I could end this right now with a bullet in your head. Oh, yeah. You can. But you won't. You won't because there's no audience here. The butterfly hits the dome. And makes some kind of spot. Oh, my God. JOE: We've got to do something. Guys? Is it just me or is it getting crazy dark outside? BARBIE:  Listen, Jim. This isn't just about killing me. This is about making sure this entire town knows that you are judge, jury and executioner. 
(people clamoring outside) What the hell? What are you trying to tell me?! This is seriously weirding me out. It's the middle of the day, but it looks like it's midnight out there. There's no moon. No stars. It's dying, Norrie. See? The dome's trying to talk to us. Maybe it's some kind of warning. The dome's telling us we have to get the butterfly out of there before it dies. But we need the others. All right, I've heard enough. All available units? Don't do this. All available units to Ben Drake's house. Listen to them. Please. I found another dome. And some sort of... egg. We're in trouble. Linda? It-It's the dome. It's all black. I know, Junior. Just get your ass over here. All right, I'm impounding this... thing until we see what happens. Linda, you found it? Jim, you need to see this. 10-4. I'm on my way, too. (siren blaring) (egg screeching) Make it stop! NORRIE: We don't know how. Yeah, we-we kind of do. Remember? Oh, yeah. That time we touched it. No, I told you. This is police property now. If anybody's gonna touch it, it's gonna be me. We have to get to that egg. And we will. After we help Barbie. No, it can't wait, Julia. If Linda takes the mini-dome, and it ends up in the wrong hands... Barbie needs my help. Our help. This might be our only shot to save his life. Are you with me? She'll be fine. JOE: It was the only way. So, now what? What did you guys do? CAROLYN: She touched the dome. JOE: She got zapped. Like Dodee. The monarch is dying, Junior. We need Angie. Screw Angie. What? She ran off with Julia. Julia was under police protection. My protection. She did what she had to do. By helping Barbie? He shot Julia. No, I saw him save her life. Things are happening, Junior. Things bigger than us. It's not always about you. BEN: Guys! It's Big Jim. He's almost here. NORRIE: Mom, you have to get out of here. You, too, Ben. This is on us. All three of us. Right, Junior? Or do you want your dad to lock that thing away before it can give us any answers? Let's go. I guess everyone is out dealing with the blackout. Permanent darkness has its bright side. Okay, the cells are down there. I'll get the keys. (grunts) (footfalls approaching) My God, how are you even standing? I don't know. But something out there really wanted me back on my feet. All right, that's enough, lovebirds. It's go time. (door creaks) Linda! Linda! Jim... Linda! Are you okay? What happened? Where is it? 
(moans) (exhales) LINDA (grunts): I don't know. But the egg... (moans) they think it's the generator. That it might be able to bring the whole dome down. Jim, we have to find it. This could be our best shot of getting out of here. (exhales) NORRIE: Now all we have to do is get Angie. We don't even know where she is. I know how to find her. You do? She has a police radio. She stole one. We could send her a message. For the entire force to hear? What can we even say? (panting) Oh, hell, no. (grunts) Don't. (panting) No handcuff keys. BARBIE: Forget about it, let's get out of here. You lose something? Hold onto those for me, will you? JOE (on radio): Angie. Angie McAlister! Angie, if you can hear me, look... we're on the move... with the mini-dome. Remember where we went to hide when we broke Mom's old mirror? Meet us there. JUNIOR: This is never gonna work. Trust me, Angie would never forget about the time we hid in the cement factory. No, I mean that thing in there is probably already dead. Joe! Thank God. JUNIOR: Don't take another step. ANGIE: Junior, stop! No! This guy's a psychopath! James, I don't know what your father told you, but Barbie didn't shoot me. A woman named Maxine did. Maxine. My dad's friend? BARBIE: Hey. Is that supposed to do that? We have no idea where Joe and Angie are meeting. There's only so many places to hide. We'll start with the McAlisters' old barn. PHIL (on radio): Linda, you there? I'm sorry. Phil, are you all right? Yeah, but Barbie got away. What? He's with Julia. She helped him escape. Phil, stay put. I'm on my way. We ready? On three. One... Two... Three. (dome humming) Whoa. It opened up. ANGIE: Oh, God. We're too late. It's dead. No... Look! ♪ 
 
 Okay, is somebody gonna tell me what the hell's going on here? I knew it. You're the monarch. (crickets chirping) Andrea... Andrea, what-what-what... what's going on? Everyone's getting right with the Lord before the end times. Hey, listen, I know people are scared, but this is a, this is a crisis, not the damn apocalypse. "And I beheld the sixth seal, "and lo, the sun became black as sackcloth." Andrea, listen... It's all happening just like Revelations said it would. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses... (praying indistinctly) (whispering): Please, God. Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. (woman humming hymn) Thank you, everybody, for coming. I know there's been a bit of a hole in our spiritual community sine the passing of Reverend Coggins, but I'm here to tell you the Good Lord has not forgotten about Chester's Mill. How can you say that? We used to be trapped, but at least I could still grow my crops. (affirmative murmuring) Without sunlight, we all starve. If we don't freeze to death first. What if the temperature starts dropping? My family is already out of propane. Listen, I give you my word: nothing like that's gonna happen. How do you know that? (murmuring loudly) (murmuring fades) I don't. (congregation murmuring) But I have faith. I have faith in us. I have faith in God. I have faith that he would never ask more of us than we can handle. The Good Book says, "Light is sown for the righteous." Well, there's been too much evil and too much lawlessness since that dome came down. Yep. MAN: Yeah. BIG JIM: That's about to change. And when it does... you trust me. Chester's Mill will have its new dawn. No way. I refuse to believe  he's  the monarch. But this has to be the way the dome picks a new leader. What, by using insects? NORRIE: Uh-oh. What now? The egg. It's doing something. Is it gonna hatch? (high-pitched noise) Looks more like it's gonna explode. (bottle shatters) What is this? What do we do? We get the hell away from that thing! BARBIE: He's right, let's go! Wait. BARBIE: No, Julia, the whole place is about to come down on us. Let's go! ANGIE: Julia, don't touch it! It's dangerous! (high-pitched noise stops) W... Why did the shaking stop? She's your monarch. (cupboard door slams) Councilman Rennie. Oh, thanks for coming, Phil. Listen, I need you to put together a work detail. Find as many carpenters as you can. What is it? It's an idea that came to me at church. My great-grandfather built the last one that was in Chester's Mill. Are you serious? This town is on the brink of chaos, son. If we want to maintain the peace, we need to show everyone exactly how serious we are about law and order. PHIL: All right. For Dodee. Yes. For Dodee. (crickets chirping) Jim, you there? Yeah, go ahead, Linda. I'm at Joe's, but there's nothing here. You're sure? Any clues to where they may have gone? Not really. Looks like they were using this barn as some weird art project. What the hell does "the pink stars are falling in lines" mean? What did you say? "The pink stars are falling in lines." Why? That mean something to you? Not for a long time. Meet me at my house, Linda. So, if Julia's in charge now, then... what are we supposed to do next? I... 
(sighs) I don't know. Exactly. She's not the monarch. There's no such thing. We have to take that egg to the real authorities. Like Big Jim? ANGIE: No. We are not taking anything to that monster. Don't talk like that. BARBIE: That's the truth, Junior. I watched your father shoot Maxine in the head. She was bound and unarmed. He executed her. JUNIOR: Bull. My dad? Hurt a woman? ANGIE: Probably one of the many reasons that the dome told us to assassinate Big Jim. No, I'm-I'm done listening to you all run down my dad. He's the only thing keeping this town together. James, calm... Shut up! All you do is lie! Junior... She told me in these same tunnels. The only reason Julia's even in Chester's Mill is 'cause she got fired from her last job for lying. Just like she's lying about my dad right now. Hand it over, Julia. Run! Angie, stop! Angie! Oh! Go! Barbie! Go! (grunting) Get up. Get up! You're done. You're done! LINDA: Jim, can you just tell me what's going on? You wouldn't believe me, that's why I have to show you. Show me what? My wife, Pauline, before she passed, she was paranoid, unstable, ranting about all kinds of crazy things. In her last months, she kept saying one thing over and over, like a mantra: "The pink stars are falling." Are you sure? Maybe it's a coincidence. (twigs snapping) Oh, thank God. Are you okay? Yeah. How about the others? JULIA: Junior got Barbie. What are we gonna do now? Okay, something this powerful has got to be what's generating the big dome. If we destroy the egg, maybe it'll go away. Or maybe it'll start another earthquake. Why don't we just try asking it? What do I say? Whatever feels right. Please... just tell us what to do. Great. Can we try blowing it up now? Holy... Mom? So, she knew all this was gonna happen. How is that possible? I don't know. But the whole time we kept thinking she was sick... maybe she was trying to warn us. I don't know why I didn't see it. Maybe I could have done more for her. Jim, you need to stay strong... for us. I mean, if your wife saw the dome coming, that means your family's important. It means  you're  important. (over radio): Linda, it's Junior. Where the hell have you been? I've got Barbie in custody. I'm bringing him in. Mom... Sweetheart... I don't think that's your mother. Forgive us, we're still learning to speak with you. We've taken on a familiar appearance to help bridge the divide. What divide? What the hell are you? JOE: I think, I think it's whoever sent the dome to Chester's Mill. ANGIE: Why? Why are you punishing us? The dome wasn't sent to punish you. It was sent to protect you. Protect us from what? You'll see... in time. How can we see anything now that you've blacked out the dome? If you want the darkness to abate, you must earn the light. How? By protecting the egg. And if we fail, it's the end, isn't it? For all of us. So how do we protect it? Who are we protecting it from? (gasping) (crying): Oh, no. (groans) I promise you, Junior, you're on the wrong side of things here. Shut up. (indistinct chatter) (hammering, indistinct chatter) Welcome back. This egg-- tell me where they took it. It's the key to all this, isn't it? Making the darkness go away? Controlling the dome? You want to know a secret? You may think that you're some kind of god to these people. But I think we both know what you really are. What's that, a... criminal? Worse. A politician. (door creaks open) Okay, we're clear. Go to the back room. Stay away from the windows. Were those gallows going up next to Town Hall? This day just keeps getting awesomer. What do we do about the egg? We need to hide it someplace safe. We're all stuck in the same Podunk town. There's nowhere to stash anything. This is Big Jim Rennie with a message for Julia Shumway. We know you have a dangerous weapon in your possession. Bring it to us now, and we'll discuss a reduced sentence for your accomplice, Dale Barbara. But fail to comply within the hour... and Barbie pays the ultimate price for his crime. (static, click) (clock ticking) Dad. Junior. Hey, good work with Barbie. He and his crew... They want to assassinate you. What are you talking about? They say that you're dangerous, that you murdered people. Do you believe it? Should I? You know, son, before today, I-I... never put much stock in miracles. I went to see your mom's old studio this afternoon. Haven't set foot in there since the day she passed. You saw them? The paintings? That this dome-- it wasn't some accident. It was destiny. Our  destiny. I don't understand. There's nothing a good man won't do for the people he loves. That's what your mom used to say all the time, right? You want the truth? I  have  taken lives. But none that didn't absolutely need to be taken... for the good of this town. Then why didn't you tell me? Because I thought I needed to protect you from all this. But I realize now that was a mistake. You and I... are in this together. The Rennies. We were chosen. Your mother knew it, and she was trying with all her heart to tell us. Those pink stars she painted are a message, son. And they're shining down on you. You and I need to do what nobody else in Chester's Mill can. We need to make the hard decisions, act on 'em, and lead. And from here on out... ...no more secrets between us. We have to help him. Barbie saved my life. NORRIE: But we can't just give Big Jim the egg. My mom, or... that woman said it would be the end for all of us if we didn't protect that thing. What does that even mean? It means our whole town is as good as dead if we let this fall into the wrong hands. NORRIE: Doesn't get more wrong than Big Jim. Dome told us as much. JOE: How do we protect Chester's Mill  and  save Barbie? We can't. So, what the hell do we do? We don't do anything. If I'm really the monarch, this has to be my decision. You three have done enough. I want you to go get somewhere safe. What are you gonna do? (crickets chirping, crowd chatter) (sighs) (crickets chirping) BIG JIM: I know you're scared. I'm scared, too. From the very first day this dome appeared, elements from outside our fair town have attempted to sow the seeds of fear and hatred in an effort to divide us. Well, no more. Today, Chester's Mill sentences Dale Barbara to death. ♪ (crickets chirping) (sighs) (whooshing) (hissing and whirring) (popping and whirring) (crowd murmuring) (whirring) BIG JIM: Friends, clearly the Good Lord has looked upon our work here today with favor. Let us thank him for this blessing. (whirring) (trilling) (loud crowd chatter) Dad, what's happening? Now, son. Do it now! Now, Junior! Do it now!
