 Chester's Mill is a place  like any other. 
 At least, it used to be... until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome. (loud boom) (cows bellowing) Invisible, indestructible, and completely inescapable. We're trapped. LINDA:  We don't know where it came from or why it's here, but now that we're all trapped under the dome together, none of our secrets are safe. JULIA:  Who the hell are you? BARBIE:  Barbie. People just call me Barbie. It's a nickname. My husband isn't here, but he'll turn up, you'll see. BIG JIM:  What do we do when the people  start asking about the propane? That's your business. (laughs) Duke, is it your pacemaker? (screams) Stop! No one can hear us all the way down here. Let me out of here! 
(screaming) Junior. Dad. You can stay with me. Come on, I'll give you the nickel tour. (grunts) Where is it? I don't have it! Yeah? My boss is not gonna like that. You got one day. You hear me? Listen, all you've got to do is pay up. You might want to think about it, all right? I mean, you don't want to do anything stupid. (grunting) (gunshot) (loud exhale) (knocking on door) Yeah? You all right? Yep. Fine. You were, uh, talking in your sleep. Yelling, actually. Is that thing still out there? Yeah, looks like it. The Hazmat suits haven't left. Julia... thanks again for letting me crash here. With my husband missing, and everything that happened today... it was nice to have the company. I'll see you in the morning. Great. Did you lose something? Yeah. You didn't happen to see a pair of dog tags around anywhere, did you? No. But I'll keep an eye out. Night. (siren wailing) Linda! Linda! What the hell happened? Who shot Duke? No one shot Duke, Paul. Calm down. He just got close to this thing, and his pacemaker exploded. Ah! Holy... If this thing blows up mechanical things, then why didn't Freddy's watch explode? It's a wind-up. It must only affect things with batteries. Either way, just check the roadblocks and make sure nobody gets near this thing. Well, who's in charge now? You're a cop. Do your job. What about me? We need to take care of Duke. BEN: Joe, wait up! I'm fine. No, you're not. An hour ago, you were having a seizure, flopping around like a fish on a hook. Did I say anything? Yeah, something about... stars. Pink  stars. Anything you want to tell me? No. JOE: Hey! Any luck, you guys? No, not yet! This thing goes down far. Oh, my God, you know what all this means? We're so not having that trig test tomorrow. Trig. That's a great idea. It is? I can totally map this thing, see if there's any holes. I'm coming with you. Dude, you don't have to. Buddy, Lewis had Clark, you got me, all right? Come on. (rock music plays) Say... did you hear anything more about the military on that contraption of yours? DODEE: Nope. I lost the signal, but I'm trying to get it back. It's not as easy as cuing up the next Van Halen track. Now, why is it that engineers always act superior to DJs? Because we're smarter, Phil. MAN: Negative, sir, fire is ineffective against the surface. But we can confirm there is no radioactivity emanating from the dome. They did it again. Second time in 24 hours they called it a dome. Yeah, I heard him. No, I don't think you did, because you'd be freaking out, too. We're under a dome, Dodee. Now, this is not just some invisible wall where a chopper can drop in and rescue us, man. We gotta tell people. And we will. It's just right now we only know enough to scare the crap out of them. To be continued. ♪ 
♪ Up to second gear, then come back down ♪ 
♪ Daddy call his boss... (music cuts out) Faithful insomniacs, Phil Bushey here. It's been a long night. And if you're listening to me, it's because you've got no choice. You see, this barrier thing is blocking all of the cell phones, TV, Internet... everything in our humble burg of Chester's Mill. Now, theories about what's causing this range from the North Koreans to a breach in the space-time continuum... BIG JIM: Well, sorry I didn't get to you sooner, Rose. Had to make sure the clinic and the nursing home were taken care of. Are you kidding me? If you're not careful, people are gonna start calling you Santa Claus. (sighs) Oh, God bless you, Jim Rennie. How much do I owe you? Ho, ho, ho. Oh, my God. The lights are back. Did that invisible wall come down? Well, I'm afraid not. But, uh, we've got gennies up and running, so we have some power, at least get back to some sense of normal. I don't believe we've met. ROSE: Councilman Jim Rennie, this is Carolyn and, uh, her partner Alice. They're staying in my spare room upstairs. They're in from L.A. We got trapped driving through your little town. We were taking our daughter Norrie to... To camp. But we have to get out of here. Our daughter is sick. She had a seizure. Does your girl have epilepsy? ALICE: No. It can happen to anyone. Caffeine, sleep deprivation. I've seen it in my patients. She's a psychiatrist. Well, I'm sorry you ladies aren't discovering Chester's Mill under better circumstances, but trust me, if you're gonna be stuck somewhere, this is the place to be. I've lived here my entire life, and, uh... 
(bell jingles) ...no place I'd rather call home. Jim. I need you to come with me. Duke's dead. Look at me, damn it! Anyone? I wouldn't even bother. (sighs) I mean, you could strip naked in front of these guys, they're still not gonna pay attention. I tried that an hour ago. They didn't even blink. Oh. I looked around, by the way, but no sign of your dog tags. Oh, yeah, no worries. You know what? I probably just left them in my car. So what makes you think these guys are under orders not to talk to us? Because they're not talking to us. Maybe they did this, you know. Maybe they're responsible. And why would they do that? I don't know. Could be, uh, an experiment. Some sort of portable detention camp. Maybe we're being used as guinea pigs. Whatever it is, these guys are the reason my husband is trapped out there! (exhales) So where you heading? The radio station. They might not be talking to us, but they are talking to somebody. (car door closes) (locks clanking) I told you, you're safe with me. Mr. Rennie! (muffled): Mr. Rennie! (banging) 
Help! Help! Mr. Rennie! Angie... My dad's not home. Mr. Rennie! (screaming): Mr. Rennie! My dad's not home! 
(screaming) Mr. Rennie! Let go of me! Let go! No... no! No! No! No! Ah! N... (grunting): Get... off. (grunts) 
Get... (panting) 
What the hell do you want from me? Look, I just want you to go back to being the Angie I knew before yesterday. We were doing great, and then this thing comes down and you... you tell me to take a hike. I think it scrambled your brain. One of us has a scrambled brain, all right. You can't see it, but I can. (sighs) You're sick, Angie. But I'm gonna make you better. If I'm so sick, then why don't you take me to the hospital? If you care about me so much? Because he might still be there. Who might still be here? The guy I saw you with. What guy? Yesterday? Outside the hospital? Barbie? The guy who came in with Mrs. Shumway? I don't even know him. Don't play dumb with me, Ange, I can see right through you. All he did was give me a cigarette. Uh-huh. What did I ever do to you?! You loved me. No. Junior... I never... Yes, Angie, you did. And when this thing comes down, you're gonna love me again. I will never love you! You were right. That guy... at the hospital, we didn't just share a cigarette. He screwed my brains out, and I loved it. I loved it more than I ever did with you. You'll never be the man that he is. Junior! Junior! BIG JIM: Holy hell. He was a good man. I loved him. He was like a father to me. He was a good friend. You know, just before he died, he tried to tell me something. (sighs) Tried telling you what? He said there were things that I didn't know about Chester's Mill. Things that he needed to protect me from. What did that mean? I wish I could tell you. (sighs) What am I gonna do with another body? The cemetery is outside the barrier, and my freezer's full. BIG JIM: Show some respect. This isn't just another body. This is Duke Perkins. What's that? Turn up your hearing aid, Lester. I said this is Duke Perkins. Oh, no. Oh, good Lord. He's Duke Perkins. Deputy Esquivel, I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you, Reverend Coggins. I should get back out there. Well, you're right, Linda. Go out there and do your job. I'll make sure Duke here gets taken care of. (door opens, closes) You're using our stuff. You're high as a kite. So what? It's Judgment Day, Jim. I might as well be feeling the Rapture. The only reason we got into this was to try to save Chester's Mill. No. That's the reason Duke went along with it. You and I, we had other priorities. (grunts) 
All right? I mean... I mean, at least now, we don't have to worry about him talking. Real man of God there, Rev. Come on, let's go. What? Where are we going? Clean up our mess. (paint can hissing) Dude, found a way out. Check it. (chuckles) 
You're such an idiot. (laughs) It's Joe, right? Yeah, McAlister. Dude, this is the guy who saved my ass when that plane went down. He totally said it was raining arms and legs. Yeah, you could say that. What are you up to? So far, I marked these points, and by measuring the distance between them, I was able to come up with the Y coordinate, and then by multiplying it by its K integer... He connected the dots. It's totally gonna be circle. So far, it looks like it's about ten miles across. It covers the entire Mill, including some of Lake Eastpointe. And you did this? Yeah, but we're being really careful. Keep it up. Where'd that guy come from? Definitely not from around here. How do you know? 'Cause he's cool. Come on, Dodee, you just had him. Patience, Philip. (radio static, muffled voices) Did you get something? Shh. MAN: Air traffic has been rerouted around Chester's Mill until further notice. Continue to monitor the airspace. JULIA: What the hell is that? (papers rustling) (sighs) 
Jim. What are you doing? I was, um, looking for that. It's Duke's will. Go ahead, read it. (sniffles) He, uh, left me his house. Everything. Of course he did. (sniffling) He treated you like the daughter he never had. (sobbing) Now what do we do? It was a close call. No thanks to you. What was I supposed to do, phone you? So what'd you find out? Nothing to do with propane. Duke must have kept the records at his house. Yeah, but it's not his house anymore. He left it to the girl. So you better get over there before she does. Me? What are you gonna do? My job, Lester. Now get out. I'm the only councilman left in Chester's Mill. (engine starts) 
I got a town to take care of. JULIA: You made this? DODEE: Yeah, I'm only three credits short of my master's degree in electrical engineering. Wow. How does it work? Well, this is a harmonic microwave frequency converter. It turns low frequency waves into high frequency waves so that we can hear them. Maybe you should just let me hear it? Okay. Um, sometimes it's hard to pick up. (static, muffled voices) MAN: Further tests reveal dome appears to be impervious to high energy lasers and all class-A corrosive chemicals. We're under a dome. Yeah, that's what they keep calling it. Why haven't you told anybody? We're not a news station. Hey, Phil? And that was some face-melting rock and roll brought to you by... I'm going on. I tried to stop her. I'm sorry, what are you doing? I'm going on the air. No, you can't. This is Julia Shumway from the weekly  Independent. I have some news for all of us stuck here inside Chester's Mill. I have just learned that the barrier around Chester's Mill is being called a dome. This information appears to be coming from military sources positioned just outside Chester's Mill, just outside the dome. We will keep updating you as information comes in. So stay tuned to... WYBS. Your only source of news from under the dome. (clicks) (sighs) What does that mean? I have no idea. I do, Mom. It means we're all gonna die in here. 
 
 ROSE: This dome thing, how big is it? No idea. We're under a dome? Are we gonna run out of air? Until I find out where Julia got this information, I think it's best that we just all stay calm. What if it collapses on us? Great, now the sky is falling. If we keep our heads and we stick together, we'll get through this. (bell jingles) 
Hey, "We'll get through this"? Huh? You don't know what this dome thing might do. You're right, but the last thing we need right now is for people to panic. That thing took Duke. Who's next? Pull yourself together and get out on patrol. People are scared, and when people are scared, they start acting stupid. Yeah, you'd have to be stupid not to be scared. You know, I just hope someone tries to blow this damn thing up. (car sensor dinging) (engine starts) Do you think he's gonna be okay? He's got to be. We're gonna need every man we got. (sighs) 
(bell jingles) Think we'll ever see him again? Who, Rusty? Come on, Linda. My brother's not gonna let some magic bubble thing keep him from seeing you again. Yeah, that is Rusty. Hey, you know what? I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but he's taking you to Hawaii for your honeymoon. That dog told me that I had to settle for Niagara Falls. Reverend. Hey. How you holding up? We got our hands full, but I think we'll make it. Yeah, you're in my prayers. Julia Shumway, back with an update. Additional reports suggest that the dome is not radioactive, but residents are advised to continue to keep a safe distance. PHIL: And now, something to take our minds off all this trouble. What? (horn honking) (rock music playing on radio) 
Hey! (horn honking) (turns off engine, music stops) Hey! Hey, stop! Stop! What the hell are you doing? I'm digging my way out. No, you're not. What the hell? Any machine touches that dome, you're fried. Says who? Duke. His pacemaker blew right out of his chest. He's dead. Duke's dead? Who's in charge? What if we're trapped in here forever? I'll never get to make out with Mila Kunis. I don't think this thing is the only thing keeping that from happening. Just think about it. We could have met every girl we're ever gonna meet. That is so depressing. What the hell? JOE: They're doing tests. Must be checking to see if water can come through. Doesn't look good. We're screwed. Wait. It's like a sieve. What the hell's a sieve? A strainer, douche. Like-like for pasta? So it does let water through? Yeah, just a little. Maybe we can get through. Aren't we, like, 70% water? Yeah, it's the other 30% that's the problem, genius. This and, uh, can you give me a pack of filtered? Actually, you know what? Make it three. Anything else? No, that's it. (cash register beeping) Thank you. (bell jingles) Didn't anyone ever tell you smoking's bad for you? Hey, no, these-these aren't for me. It's an investment. We end up getting stuck in here for a while, you would be surprised what people will swap for these things. So I'd probably hang onto that candy bar if I were you. (scoffs) JULIA: What's wrong? You had it working before. DODEE: It's not like punching in the presets on your car radio. This takes finesse. Finesse, my ass. She's just diddling. Sometimes she gets lucky. MAN: Further tests reveal the dome appears to be impervious to high-energy laser. How's that for lucky? Shh. This is Mobile Ground Unit 2. After exhaustive testing we are unable to determine the origin or the composition of the dome. Oh, my God, the military doesn't know what it is. So? So it means they didn't do it. They're not responsible. Who is? (hinges creak) (gun clicks) Empty. (clip clicks into gun) Come on. Come on. Hey. What have you got there? Why are you following me? So, this is where you did it. I don't know what the hell you're talking about. This is where you screwed her. I know all about you and Angie. Who's Angie? Don't act like you don't know. Looks like she put up a pretty good fight. She belongs to me. That's too bad for her. (growls) (grunting) She still belongs to me. You just stay the hell away from me. Or what? The next time, I'm not gonna stop. (hinges creak) Ah! (chuckles) Ah... (chuckles) The Lord works in mysterious ways. (chuckles) (gasps) Ah-ah! Ah! Ah! Help! No! Lord, help! (barking) (dog whines) Aw, man. His master must've been right here. Someone must've dragged the rest of the body away. (dog whines) JOE: Poor fella. The dog's the poor fella? I kind of feel sorrier for the cut-in-half dude. His name's Truman. What're we gonna do with him? We can't just leave him here. Holy crap. Look. A fire. Let's go check it out. Come on, Truman! (tires squealing) You almost killed us! PAUL: I got something for you. Paul, what are you thinking? This town is one click away from total and complete lawlessss. When the time comes, I'm ready, and you should be, too. We're on the same side here. Yeah, for now. (shotgun racks) Who the hell are you?! Easy. That's the guy that saved the McAlister kid when the plane crashed in the dome. JACKIE: Linda, you there? Get out here so I can see you. Come here. Go ahead, Jackie. Sarah Martin just drove over. She says there's a fire at 223 Pretty Valley Road. Oh, my God, that's Duke's house. Get every warm body out there to help. You can kiss it good-bye-- the entire Chester's Mill's fire department's out there and we're in here. Put that rifle down and get your ass to Duke's. You're not my boss. Now. You, warm body. Get in. PAUL (over scanner): Any fire trucks still here? LINDA: Rusty and his buddies took them all to Westlake for that damn parade. Clear the line and get to Duke's. Damn it, Coggins. (tires squeal) WOMAN: Where's the fire department? MAN: Right over here! Come on! MAN 2: Right now, they're coming. Hey, stay back! Stay back! Stay back! COGGINS: Help! Help! Somebody, somebody help me! (sirens approach) MAN: Get out of the way! (sirens stop) What are you doing here? I heard it on the scanner. What happened? I have no idea. I'm just glad Duke lived alone. FREDDY: Come on. Everyone, please stand back. Come on. Keep a safe distance. We have to put this out. How the hell are we gonna do that? You guys still got your water pressure, right? So, go and get as many garden hoses as you can. Go. Go-go-go-go-go-go. Hey, guys, we need hoses. Go. Go get water. FREDDY: Whose got a hose? Whose is that right there? Grab your hose! Excuse me. MAN: Brian, your hose! Backyard! (camera shutter clicks) Barbie. (camera shutter clicks) It hasn't rained in weeks. We're inside a damn tinderbox. If those flames spread to any of these other houses, it's gonna take Chester's Mill and us with it. Hey, everybody who does not have a garden hose, I want you to go get a bucket, get a pot, get-get a trash can, something. Anything that can hold water. Let's go. MAN: Let's go, get buckets! COGGINS: Help. Please help me! Someone's inside. Linda! Somebody help me! Help! (grunts) (tires squeal) Anybody in here?! (coughing) Hello?! Linda! You okay? (coughs) Yeah. What the hell was Coggins doing in Duke's house? I don't know. Where did Jim go? I don't know. PAUL: Get out of here, guys. There's a propane tank next to the house. Oh, my God, that's a propane tank! Let's go, let's go, get out of here. Come on, get him out. Go, go! (multiple explosions) The flames are too high. The hoses aren't cutting it. JULIA: The fire is spreading to the shrubs. Get another hose over there. CAROLYN: There's not enough water pressure. Can you imagine our neighbors back in Brentwood helping out this way? I don't even know who our neighbors are. FREDDY: We got to go faster. We got to go faster. Vic, you holding up all right? Come on, guys, that's right. Just like that. We got to get more water on this thing, all right? Come on. Keep going. Keep going, everyone. We got to get more water. Come on. Faster, faster. LINDA: Keep at it, people. The fire is spreading to the fence. The house will be next. Deputy, give me a hand. Over there, the bottom of the fence. Bottom of the fence. Get more buckets! Get some buckets in here. The car's on fire. Guys, back, everybody back. This isn't gonna work. It's like playing Whac-a-Mole. As long as Duke's house is burning, the fire is just gonna keep jumping. Then it's over. Or not. Hey, make some room! Let's go! Clear the street. Get out of the street. Let's go. FREDDY: Hey, back up. Everybody get back. Everybody get back. Let's go. What the hell is Big Jim doing? Is he insane? He's gonna tear down Duke's house. (beeping) (beeping) (grunting, panting) (metallic bang) (lock clanks open) What the hell happened to you? I took care of your boyfriend. My boyfriend? The guy you've been screwing. Killed him. No, you didn't. He's dead, Angie. He's never gonna touch you ever. I don't believe you. Why not? I've known you since the third grade, James. Even you couldn't do something that terrible. (chuckles softly) That's my Angie. I brought you something. This is what we're working for. (lock clanks shut) (sighs) Bucket brigade. Pretty clever. You weren't too shabby yourself. Why, thank you. Dale. Dale Barbara. I'm guessing that's you. Guilty. Where'd you find them? Uh, you know what, they were actually just right there, where I left them, just hanging over the mirror in you bathroom. Huh. That's the first place I checked. I must have missed them. How's he doing? It's lucky Linda got to him when she did. (groans) Took in a lot of smoke, but I think he's gonna pull through. Mind if I have a moment with him? What the hell you thinking? You told me to clean up our mess. You call this cleaning it up? How is he? Well, there's someone up there watching over him. Thank you for saving me. 
(coughs) You're welcome, but what in the world were you doing in there? (sighs) I was, uh... ...getting a suit for Duke's funeral. (coughs) 
I switched on a light, and then I can't really remember the rest. Must have been a gas leak. The dome's right there in Duke's backyard. Probably, uh, severed a line. Well, we're just all glad you're okay, Reverend. Bless you, child. (coughs) ROSE: Linda, thank you for saving the reverend. (indistinct chatter) I'm just... I'm just doing my job. Thank you, everyone, for a job well done. Well, we couldn't have done it without you, Big Jim. Ah... (indistinct chatter) BIG JIM: I appreciate that, but, uh, this isn't about me. It's about all of us. We stood together, shoulder to shoulder, like a town should in times like these. Now, this is not gonna be the last crisis that Chester's Mill faces, but we'll get through the next one with the same courage and solidarity that we showed today. (applause) 
Thank you all. Like hell we will. Go ahead, pat yourselves on the backs all you want, but we're toast. Great, you can put out a fire. So what? That thing... that thing is trapping smoke, and there's no way out. Hey, come on, man. Take it easy, Paul. Back up. FREDDY: Hey. (low, indistinct talking) Don't you tell me to take it easy. You know, you're just like him. You know, like, you're lying to these people, and you're promising that everything is gonna be okay, and it's not gonna be okay! This thing is never gonna go away, and we're all gonna die! (gunshots) 
Paul, don't! (crowd gasps) Oh, no, no, Freddy! Freddy? Freddy, stay with me. Freddy! Breathe, stay with me, come on. Stay with me, Freddy. Freddy, Freddy. Freddy!
