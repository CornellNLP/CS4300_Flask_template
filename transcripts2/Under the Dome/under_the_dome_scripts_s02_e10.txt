 A few weeks ago an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world. 
 Why the dome is here, what mysteries lie ahead, we still don't know. 
 Every day it tests our limits, bringing out the best and the worst in us. 
 Some say we'll be stuck here forever, but we will never stop fighting to find a way out. Well, Hunter May, meet my son Dale. Hunter, we need you to work your magic, send one more message into the dome. Barbie! Don't jump! Barbie! JOE: Maybe the guys who took Barbie  are the same ones who want the egg. How would they even know about it? We'll protect it. No better place to hide than right under my dad's nose. And you all think it powers the dome? That's the... the working theory, right? Yeah. BIG JIM: It's my job to lead the people of this town to freedom. BARBIE: Who are you? She's a friend of mine... Pauline Verdreaux. Pauline Rennie? James' mother. I think that door's the way back into the dome. BARBIE: I know where this is. Grew up there. All right. Let's go, let's go. What the hell? SAM: We're back somehow. Pauline? Pauline? It's me. That's impossible. You... What are you doing here? Did the dome send you? Like Linda and Dodee to torment me? What? No, Jim. It's really me. No, no. No. You died. You died nine years ago. I was never dead. You drove your car into a tree. I... I saw the wreck. I read the report. I picked out your casket. I was never inside the car. It was a cadaver. Lester Coggins helped me. And Lyle, too. He knew what to use to make the car burn so that there would be nothing left. It was the only way! The only way for what? It was the only way to get out of Chester's Mill! I told you about my visions. You saw my paintings. I knew something terrible was coming. So you ran away and left me and Junior? To protect my family. I thought the dome would follow me. And you would never let me go! You're gonna stand here in your son's room and make excuses to me? Stop it. You destroyed him, Pauline. You destroyed your own son. (crying): Stop. For all these years, I thought it was my fault. Jim... Jim? I came back. Jim, I came back! Hey. Hey. Look at this. See anything strange? That's leaves have turned. Like it's fall. Except it's summer. The temperature's dropped in the last two days. This is an oak. One of the first to change. Any idea why this is happening? Somehow the dome is accelerating the seasons. Normally, fall's my favorite. Book by the fire, nice glass of pinot, but... this is just odd. JULIA: Oh, my God! Julia? Julia? You came back. I did. I'm gonna get everybody out. What happened? How are you here? Barbie, how the hell did you get back? (shivers) Let's talk inside. It's freezing. Since when did it become Alaska in here? No kidding. And, uh... Melanie's not here. Junior either. We have the whole place to ourselves. Better keep each other warm. (laughs) Wait. Melanie hasn't been here in, like, a day. She's probably at Julia's. (groans) Out doing Jane Fonda exercises, whatever people did in the '80s. Oh, come back. Oh, my God, Joe. The egg is gone. What? You think she took it? The way she protects that thing, I bet she did. Come on, let's go find her. Junior? Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. It's okay. I should go. Julia might be worried. I shouldn't have let us fall asleep. If she's mad I didn't come home, I'll just blame it on you. (quiet laugh) Tell her you locked me up down here. What? I... I was just kidding. (quiet laugh) Um... You're sure the egg's safe down here? Uh, this place is built to withstand nuclear bombs. It's the safest place in town. Well... I guess I'll see you later. Yes. See you later. Junior! (panting) Angie? Think about what you're doing. With her down here? It... it's not what you think. You're gonna want to follow your heart. Don't. I-I don't know what you mean. MELANIE: Junior? (footsteps approaching) Did you say something? No. Okay. Bye. Bye. Angie? Angie? So you jump off an underground cliff and somehow land all the way in Zenith? Where you wake up on a playground. It surprised the hell out of me, too. But the same thing happened to Sam and Lyle. And you feel okay? No physical injuries or... or psychological disturbances? The way there was a blur, but... but I woke up, I was fine. The way back... I had this memory from a long time ago. What? It was just something from when I was a kid. How'd the others fare? Well, Lyle... He didn't come up out of the water with the rest of us. Is he dead? I don't know. You know, maybe he came up first. He drowned. Or maybe he's trapped somewhere in between. I don't know. What matters is that we can use that cliff to get everybody out of here. But we need a plan. Last thing we want is a stampede. Let's start with the people we trust. I will walkie Tom and Andrea. Have them meet us at the Sweetbriar in an hour. All right. (door closes) There's finally a way out. And I don't know if we should take it. SAM: Melanie! Sam? How are you alive? I survived the fall. Listen, I'm not back to hurt anyone. Especially you. You killed me... I didn't push you into the crater that night. So, it was Lyle? Yes. I helped bury you. We all did. And then we ran. And I've regretted it every day since. Imagine if you'd trusted me, and protected the egg. Maybe none of this would've happened. Maybe the dome wouldn't have come down. Maybe no one would've died. Melanie? I am so sorry... Melanie. For everything. I have a lot of unfinished business. And I figured this might be my only chance. You never know how many chances you're gonna get. PAULINE: Jim, what are you doing? I was just thinking. About us. I thought maybe I'd find Junior out here. It's exactly as it was the day I left. It was my way of keeping you alive. I used to come out here and... stare at these and try to figure out what made you so... Crazy? Tormented. Where were you, Pauline? How did you get inside the dome? Through a cellar door on Barbie's family property in Zenith. Barbie? You saw Dale Barbara in Zenith? Fate, I guess. He came back with me. And Sam. And a former student of mine. And Lyle. Except Lyle didn't make it. I'm sorry to hear that. But why would you want... to come here? For Junior. And you. I shouldn't have run like that. Whatever my reasons, I was wrong. No, you weren't. You were right. About the pink stars falling, about the dome, about everything. All of it. I wasn't a good man back then. I know that. I didn't listen, I kept pushing you away. But the dome has shown me things, a new way to be. And now it's brought you back to me. Pauline, I can... I can prove you that I've changed. Jim, I... I don't know. You loved me once before, didn't you? Yes. Very much. Well, then we can be a family again. I'm gonna lead everyone out of here. And when it's over, when you and me and Junior are out... we'll be together. (chuckles) I have always believed that the dome is here to protect us. What if it still is? Maybe it started out that way, okay? But there's barely any food left. You got no medical supplies. Now, all of a sudden, it's getting colder by the hour. I realize that. But Lyle didn't make it. I mean, if these people die getting out, that's on us. What I know is: we stay here, we die here. And what's waiting in Zenith? The playground is under surveillance. You were interrogated, beaten. That's because they wanted the egg. So I say this: "Let's give it to 'em." My dad sent that video, right? He's behind this whole thing. So my thinking is, if we give him what he wants, maybe they leave us alone. So... we leverage the egg. I go first and I tell them that it's theirs, so long as they let the whole town through. You come last with the egg. I have to go first. No. No, you're not, no. There's no way I'm letting you do that... What would've happened if you hadn't escaped? It'll be worse if they capture you again. I should go. Julia, they're not gonna go easy on you. I can handle it. And if you don't get a message agreeing to the deal, you'll be here. Mm-mm. These people are gonna need you. No. If I don't get a message agreeing to the deal... I'm coming to find you. (door opens) (door closes) Melanie. Where were you? I was... (gasps) You're back! (whispers): Hey. It's good to see you. Mel. Where's the egg? It's... gone from Angie's apartment. But... but Barbie's here. Why do you want it? (wry laugh) Because it's our way out. (murmuring) N-No. I'm sorry, Julia, but... I, I can't tell you where it is. (whispers): Hey. Can I talk to you for a second? All four hands should have a say in where the egg is kept and Melanie's probably sitting on it in a nest she built somewhere. So we'll find it and we'll take it back. How? Well, Julia and Dodee built that yogi thing. It's a piece of crap. Yeah, so we'll build a better one. NORRIE: Who the hell are you? (softly laughs) Hey. I'm Hunter. And you're Joe McAlister, Vlog Master, and @neithernorrie, slaying the world a hundred and forty characters at a time. Okay. How do you know who we are? Especially since you've, apparently, just popped up out of the ether. Well, A: You guys are celebrities online. And B: I just came from Zenith with Barbie. Barbie's back? You came here on purpose? I wasn't about to turn down the chance to check out the dome. It was a... (taps twice) watery arrival... but my phone survived... obviously there's no service, but that is my site's homepage. Hounds of Diana. You e-mailed me. Uh-huh. (chuckles) And direct tweeted me. Yeah. Hunter. What are you doing here with all of this stuff? Uh... desperately trying to, uh, establish contact with the outside world, but... no luck. Want help tracking down that egg? Are you a mind reader? No. You guys were loud coming down that hallway. What do you know about the egg? I... work for Barbie's dad at Aktaion. (laughs): That egg's been the subject of many of a meeting. I'd say our best best's a sound wave detector. All energy sources emit a frequency, even if we can't hear it. That could work. Do you think we could get our hands on a radar gun? Yeah, the police station has to have one. Well, you guys know if there's anything to eat around there? Because all I brought was this? I call dibs. Food from the outside? HUNTER: Hey. What did it feel like when the bomb hit this thing? I'll tell you after you tell us how you got in here. No. I can't tell you where the egg is. But ev-ev... (grunts) even if it's our ticket out of here? No. (birds chirping) You know, I've seen that necklace before. Yeah. You found it where they buried me. Let me ask you... Have you ever been to, uh... a big white house in Zenith? There's a b-big lawn... um... pool... there's a root cellar. With a red door. (softly laughs) With a red door, yeah. Yeah, and my mom brought me there once. I-I spent the afternoon playing with this little boy; he was so sweet. We painted that door red and he... he put his hand on it. Yeah. That-that was me, Melanie. That was me... I was that boy. Uh... but... uh... how do you know?! I know, because I remember. I, I was there, I remember. We were, we were playing and then you-you had to leave in a hurry... Yeah. My mom was so upset, she... That... that... that boy's dad... um... your... your dad, he kept saying, "Laura, Laura. I'm so sorry." Oh, my God. What? My parents... used to fight about a woman named Laura, because I guess my dad was involved with her in a relationship before he married my mother. Your dad and my mom? Yeah. They had... they had a daughter together. Wait. Are you saying that...? I'm saying... that you are my sister, Melanie. (laughs softly) That's why she brought me there. To meet you before we moved. She never would tell me who my father was. It's why you looked so familiar. Yeah. And that's... that's why I had this memory on the way back into the dome. This wasn't a coincidence; there's a reason for this. What's the reason? You and I are supposed to lead people out of here, into Zenith, but we need the egg to do that. No. No. No, I... I can't give it up. I... I know something bad will happen if I don't protect it. Melanie, I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you. Just come to Sweetbriar Rose with us, okay? Hear us out. Okay. BIG JIM: Junior's 18th birthday. (sobs, sighs) I've missed so much of my son's life. Pauline, you're gonna be... a part of everything that has to do with this family moving forward. (door creaks open) (door closes) Mom? (exhales): Oh, James. Uh... James... Oh... (exhales) How... how are you here right now? It's a long story. You can, um... you can tell him over breakfast, then. Where are you going? I'm sheriff... I've got responsibilities to the town. I got to... talk to Barbie about an exit strategy. Be good to your mom, Junior. Uh, d-do you want me to get you something to eat? No, no, I'm... I'm okay. Come on, I'll make you something. What do you like? It's fine. Mom, Mom, stop, stop. Stop. Is there... You can have... Lyle told me why you left. You saw the video and you didn't tell Jim? No. I didn't know how. (exhales) That's for the best. Your father and I, we're not good for each other. He thinks we're a family again. If that helps us get out, that's fine. Everybody had their reasons for coming back. You're mine. Barbie's back. Who else? Sam. Your uncle has a lot to atone for. He can never do that for killing Angie. He only did it because of what I put in my journal. You drew a picture! He murdered a girl. (exhales) Where are you going? To the station... I'm Dad's deputy. (high-pitched ringing) (sighs) (ringing continues) (breathing heavily) (screaming) Make it stop! (sobbing): Make it stop. You want everyone to jump off a cliff? It's not as crazy as it sounds. That cliff leads to the same place it did for Barbie: our deaths. BARBIE: It leads to Zenith. I guarantee it. Oh, I don't believe it. Look, please, we need you guys on board to help us get everyone out. We'll use the census. We divide the town into groups, everyone gets a leader and someone with first aid experience and a mix of ages. Chester's Mill is our home. We're not forcing anyone to leave. But staying's a really bad idea. You feel how cold it is? Our microclimate's disrupted. With dwindling fuel and not enough food, we have to get out while we can. I'm not doing anything till I know where Big Jim stands on this. (door opens) What about you, Tom? (door closes) Sign me up as a leader. There's nothing left for us here. So, assuming people do take a leap of faith and jump off the cliff, what happens when we get to Zenith? Uh, the plan's for Julia to go first. She's gonna lay out the terms. Which are? Safe passage for the entire town. Once everyone else is out, Barbie and Melanie will jump with what they want. "They" being the soldiers in black. And what they want... (door opens) is the egg. (door closes) And how do I fit into your little plan? 'Cause I'm a part of it. Starting now. 
 
 Is this what you're looking for? That's it. Okay. Changed the firmware to adjust the IF output. Yep. The wave guide's modified, enhancing the tonal range. Uh, translation from geek, please? We're making it pick up high-pitched frequencies instead of movement. Oh. Of course. By the way, once we get out? Don't mention any of this to my parole officer. She wouldn't approve. Wait. You have a parole officer? Repercussion of exploiting the server vulnerabilities of Fortune 500 companies. Sounds awesome. Nothing compared to finding out what it's like under the dome. Ironic. All we want to know is what's happening outside of it. Okay. Well, you want to do the honors? It works. The egg is somewhere to the west. Okay, so, what are we waiting for? Let's go get that egg. Actually, Hunter, thanks for helping us build this thing. But... that's as far as it goes. Yeah. Unfortunately. It's just something Norrie and I have to do alone. Dude, it's no worries. I... I actually want to go get some pictures around town for my Hounds of Diana Web site. You don't trust him? I-I-I trust us. We're two of the four hands. Not him. You really think he'd take the egg for himself? And how would he know that there's a locker at the school that leads to a cliff that's the way out of Chester's Mill and all you have to do is jump? JOE: Maybe Barbie told him. Anyway, we have a signal. Let's find that egg. So, what's the problem? We give them the egg, we get our freedom. We have to do this carefully, Jim. Whoever's out there's not gonna detain 2,000 people. This is still America. (groans) Oh, oh. You mean the same people that bombed this place, right? You-you don't even know what you're dealing with. I know what's best for this town. Which is why I'll be going first to negotiate. Excuse me? I'm the sheriff. I'm the only elected official here. You're also a lifelong used car salesman. That's right. Which means I know how to cut a deal. Love me or hate me, I get things done. Your whole family's here now, right? He goes first. He goes first, they stay behind. That way he's got every reason to make sure that we all get through safely. (stammers) Fine. Fine. Go first. But not until the entire town has been informed and the exit teams are in place. I'll leave that in your hands. Spread the word as fast as you can. (door opens, closes) You heard it. The whole plan depends on taking the egg with us. What do you say, Melanie? Pauline, we're leaving! I worked it out. You, me and Junior, we're getting out of here. We're gonna be free. It's coming soon, soon. It's coming. What are you...? Oh, my God. It's the end of everything, Jim. I see it in my head. That's you, me and Junior. My head... make it stop! Is this what's gonna happen next? (Groaning) Is our family in danger? Oh, it hurts. Make it stop. My head. Make what stop? What's hurts? Make what stop? Make it stop. What are you talking about? The egg. It's screaming. The egg? Well, where is it? What...? Really? You can't hear that? I'm trying! I'm trying! I can't hear... Oh, God! You haven't changed. You don't believe me. Just like always. I have changed. I do believe you. Everything you painted has came true. I believe you, I just... I can't... Stop. Stop it. Babe, babe, babe, calm down. Stop it! Stop it! Calm down! Calm down! Calm down! Calm down! Get out of here! Get out! Calm down... Get out of here! I'm trying to help. Get out! Aah! Just calm down! I'll-I'll help you! I'll-I'll get help, I promise. (moaning) Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no! No! Don't lock me in here, please! Don't lock me in here! I'm trying to keep you safe. No! Don't lock me in here! Listen, I'll get us out of here, I promise! I made a deal with a guy, okay? Jim, please! Please! He's gonna take care of our family. I promise he'll get us out of here! No, no! Trust me! Just got to find that damn egg. (high-pitched ringing) (high-pitched ringing) She was right about this, too. (high-pitched ringing) You'll let me carry the egg over? Yeah, I-I will be beside you the entire time. Do we really have to give it to those people out there? Once our dad sees you alive again, that is all he's gonna care about. Not some egg. I need a minute. (door opens) Did you just make a promise you can't keep? Right now, this is all riding on her and Big Jim talking the talk. Oh, that actually worked out well. I know. He doesn't mean anything to your dad. And now neither one of us has to risk being nabbed. Hey. Are you having second thoughts? Not about leaving. No. About what? We met because of the dome. And we never really talked about you and me out in the world. Oh. (laughs) Julia. Hey. I want you in my life whether we end up in Zenith or wherever. That's a promise that I can keep. (door opens) Good. MELANIE: Guys. You want the egg or not? (high-pitched ringing) That's it. Let's get it and get the hell out. Why is it screaming? Something's scaring it. (high-pitched ringing stops) It's not us. You calmed it down. Now it's time to go. (gasps) Where? The cliff under the school. That thing's going to Zenith. Barbie's back. There's no reason. It's not a debate. I don't have to do anything you say. You're right. You don't, I'm gonna shoot him. Don't worry about me, Norrie. All that matters is protecting the egg. You wouldn't shoot Joe. There's a long list of people who've gone against me. I got no problem adding Joe McAlister to it. Let's go. Pretty calm for a dead man. I figured you'd stop by. I hope it doesn't have to end this way. Angie hoped it wouldn't end with you swinging an axe down on her head. I thought it would bring the dome down. I would do anything to take it back. You put her bracelet under my bed so I'd think I blacked out and killed her. I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do. Don't worry. It'll be over soon. Junior, I can't take back what I've done. You still have a choice. You're right. Bullet's too quick. (grunting) You still have to suffer. (Grunting) Get up. Get up! (groaning) Hit me. Fight back. Fight back. Fight back! Fight back! (Groaning) (grunting) (panting) (grunting) (panting) I'm gonna do to you... what you did to Angie. ANGIE: Junior, stop! (sighs) Where is the signal? BIG JIM: Shut up. Keep going. All right, let's go. Through the locker and to the cliffs. Come on. You can't kill him. How can you come back and protect him? Sam still has a part to play. So does each of the hands. If he dies, everyone under the dome will suffer. I loved you, and he took you away from me. You never loved me. You locked me up, wanting to keep me. That's not love. That is possession. Why do something that can't be undone to avenge a love that wasn't even real? You're not real. You're just the dome playing tricks on me. Junior, I'm telling you not to do this. (breathing hard) Look at me. Look at me. Don't do it. For me. Look at me. No! (sobbing) See, Angie? I really did love you. (sniffles) It's freaking out. What are we supposed to do? Do not throw the egg. If that's the power source to the dome, we could all die. If I don't, he'll kill you. That's enough talking. That thing needs to go, now. (high-pitched ringing) - Look at it. It doesn't want me to. Well, maybe it doesn't want to be here. This is about my family. Now, you throw it over now. What about the rest of us? You've always said you love everybody in Chester's Mill. I do. Then don't make us do this. My wife is suffering. And everybody's gonna get out, too, okay? But that egg needs to go now. (Norrie gasps) (high-pitched ringing stops) (panting) See? Okay, no one's dying. Everything's okay. (rumbling, cracking) Joe! (Yells) Run. Run! (rumbling, glass shattering) It was right here, it was right here! Okay, we gotta go! Junior took it? I don't know! Let's go! Okay, come on! No! (grunts) Melanie! Melanie! What's wrong with her? I don't know. She's barely breathing. Help me get her up. Come on, help me! Hey, I'm down here! Come on! Help me! Help! (rumbling, cracking continues) (grunting) Junior, where's your uncle? What happened? I don't know! Where's Sam? Sam! Put her down on the table. Get my EMT bag from the kitchen. She collapsed during the earthquake. Her pulse is weak. SAM: Shallow breathing... We gotta get her heart rate up. What happened to your face? Don't worry about it. Atropine! It's in the vial. It's atropine. JUNIOR: How long before it works? (coughs) (panting) Did you take the egg? No. Is it gone? Maybe Joe and Norrie have it. Oh, I just hope they're okay. We should go find them. BARBIE: Yeah. Hey, stay with her. And, Sam, don't let anything happen to her. Her pulse is still weaker than it should be. Right now, what she needs is rest. The dome was right. If I'd killed you earlier, she'd be dead. Yeah, well, she still might be if I don't find a way to keep her stable. She's one of the hands. You better. Is it safe? Safer than staying down here. Nice of Big Jim to wait. (grunts) (screams) Come on. Come on, I got you. Pull me up! Come on! Come on. (whimpers) Come on. You okay? What the hell was that earthquake? You don't want to know. Let's get out of here in case another one happens. Yeah. Come on. I thought you went to take photos. I forgot my battery pack. Good thing, huh? Yeah. (Rumbling) BIG JIM: Pauline. Pauline, are you okay? They're gone. What's gone? My visions. The minute the earthquake hit, they stopped. Well, let's go. Come on, let's get out of here. I don't know what's gonna happen now. I do. We go get Junior and we're the first three over the cliffs. Okay? I tell the guard on the other side I gave him what he wanted. The egg stopped screaming. I know. Because I threw it over the cliff. To Zenith. No... I did it... I did it for you. I did it... No, Jim. No. (crying) What have you done? Joe and Norrie have to be here somewhere. Barbie, Julia! Big Jim made us throw the egg off the cliff. He did what? He had a gun. All right, let's go. Come on. Phil! Phil, stop! Barbie, here! Careful. He's gone. BARBIE: What the...? There's a bottom now. The egg's gone. The passage closed. We're stuck here.
