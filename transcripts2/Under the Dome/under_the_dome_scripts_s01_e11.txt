 Chester's Mill is a place like any other. 
 At least it used to be until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome. 
 Invisible, indestructible, and completely inescapable. We're trapped. We don't know where it came from or why it's here,  but now that we're all trapped  under the dome together, none of our secrets are safe. It's the pink stars. And they're making constellations. What does it mean? Peter got in over his head and forced you to kill him to defend himself. I found this life insurance policy... This would be void if he committed suicide. Hello, Max. The past few days I've been watching you. Anything bad happens to me, your secret's gonna come out. That's my daughter, Maxine. Now do me a favour and drop that gun that... Annabelle! Please! It's amazing. It's still just a barn, Galileo. So all the dots in that egg made constellations but, what does that mean? Maybe the dome is trying to communicate. It stopped the riots with rain, made us babble about pink stars... I wonder what it's trying to tell us now. I don't know. These four stars aren't part of any constellation. I think they're us. What's this guy have to do with that? It changed color over night. From green to clear. I see its wings now. It's a monarch. It's gonna hatch into a butterfly. It's pretty rad. It's not rad. It's insane. We're like the guardians of some secret cosmic mystery. It's too much, it's too much. We gotta tell somebody. The dome's been pretty clear about not wanting anyone else to know about it. When Dodee snuck in here, she got zapped and wound up in the hospital. We could tell Julia. When she touched this thing, she said my ghost told her that the monarch will be crowned. Maybe she's not one of us, but she might have some answers. JUNIOR: He's right. That thing's gonna hatch, and when it does, maybe it will... lead us to something. Or someone. Like the monarch's a person. Like a king maybe. Who might be able to bring the dome down. All right. So the dome trusts Julia. Joe, go tell her. I just want to make sure that we're on the same page. So, you, Duke Perkins and Reverend Coggins conspired to acquire a vast amount of propane? Yeah, we bought propane off the books. But only to keep this town afloat. By selling it to Maxine Seagrave? A drug dealer? But you kept some of it in your warehouse. And you can thank the Lord that we did. Because right now in the middle of this... nightmare, the lights are on. Because your generator is running using my propane. The diner's open because of my propane. We're setting up irrigation for crops, bartering systems. Hell, Chester's Mill might just stay alive because of my propane. You think I'm a crook? (laughs) I think I'm owed a damn parade. You know, it doesn't change the fact that if this dome hadn't come down, you'd be in jail. I'd say it saved your ass, Big Jim. So, go ahead. Charge me with conspiracy to keep the lights on. Or... ...you can go after a real criminal. And who might that be? Someone who's a real mystery in this town. A man who just got here. Who's only out for himself. And isn't shy about... letting people know it. How was the couch? Lonely. So was the bed. Do you want me to leave? I want you to take me to Peter's grave. For us to move forward, I need closure. I think you do, too. So... yeah, I need to see Peter's grave. I'll go get dressed. LINDA: You want me to go after Barbie? What did he ever do? Wake up, Linda. Barbie wasn't just passing through Chester's Mill. He was here, working for Max Seagrave. He was? That's her gambling enforcer. He was here putting the screws to people in this town-- our town. No, this sounds... Crazy? Till it's true. Here's a name you haven't heard in a while. Peter Shumway. He was up to his eyeballs in debt to Max. Barbie was with him the day the dome came down. And guess what? Haven't heard a peep from old Peter since. You know, some people have secrets you... you couldn't imagine. What about you? I'm an open book. (doorbell rings) I got it. Can I help you? Right now, you can't even help yourself. Julia! Hold on. Linda, are you there? LINDA (over radio): I'm here, Barbie. Julia's been shot! What? She answered the door and somebody shot her. Who? I don't know! If you can believe him. Linda, listen, I can't drive and keep her from bleeding out at the same time. I need someone to give me a ride right now. I'll be right there, Barbie. Linda... think. Think. You hungry? Yeah. Well, our chickens are still laying eggs. I can scramble some up. Can you believe it, Angie? Uh, no, it's... all been pretty crazy. I mean us. I... I, uh... I never thought fate was real. That there was this... plan. But now it's undeniable. What are you talking about? The way our lives are braided together. And they will be forever. What? Are you insane?! You kept me prisoner, okay? I almost died down there! But you didn't. We're both alive and we're here right now. It is the four of us who are connected. It is not about you and me. It will never be about you... I don't believe you. Well, believe it! We will never be together! And if somehow we make this dome come down, then I am gone, too. And you will never see me again. Then I'm out. What? I'm done with you, with this, the mini-dome, all of it. You can't just walk out. We need your... My hand? I know... my hand on the little dome so we can make pink stars and do whatever the hell else it wants to do. This might be our only shot. (chuckles) And you're gonna ruin that out of spite? (wind blowing) I've never met someone so selfish! It's love, Angie. I'd rather live in here and die in here than be apart from you. (door slams) (wind howling) (engine sputtering) Damn it! Great. Now even the cops are getting ripped off. I need a ride! No gas. (groans) Stop your vehicle! 
(tires screech) What, are you carjacking me? Phil, I need a ride to Julia's. She just got shot. Get in. (wind howling) Joe! Barbie? Hey, get in here right now! Oh, my God. Can you drive? Uh, yeah. I have my learner's permit, but the guy said I didn't check my mirrors. Just help-help me get her in the car. Now come on. Sit her up. Let's go. Sit her up. Get the door! Get the door! (grunts) Are we good? Yeah, we're good. Go! (tires squealing) (tires squeal) What the hell? Hell's down here. You want a ride? You just happen to be in the neighborhood? It'll be nice to get a little bit of rain. You and I need to talk. Somebody shot Julia Shumway. It's a perilous world we live in. I know it was you. Well, Barbie said the one word a girl hates to hear: "No". Where is this going, Max? That's up to you, Jimmy. Life's all about making the right choices. You make the right one, you play nice, and it's good between us. You step out of line like Barbie did...? Lucky for me I'm single. Oh, I'm sure there's someone around here you care about. JUNIOR: Dad. Go on to work, Junior. Well, look who I  finally  get to meet. Junior, hi. Hi. I'm a friend of your dad's. Hi. Wow, you are, you're a Rennie, all right. Those eyes, it's, like... it's like I'm looking right at your mom. I bet you face a lot of danger being a police officer, and I bet your dad is just constantly worried about you, huh? All right, that's enough, Max. I better get going. I have some business to attend to on Bird Island. The weather's acting up. I'm not sure it's a great time to be on the water. Aren't you sweet to think about me? Your dad, he is so thoughtful, to the end. I'll be at the factory later on if you need me. Ciao. Who was that? The devil. (horn blaring) Julia! Jul, hey, hey, hey, stay with me. Hey, you got to hurry, Joe. She's crashing! I'm working on it. (tires squeal) Sorry. You're doing great, Joe. Just get us there. It's pretty bad up there. Yeah, it's pretty bad back here, too, Joe. I mean, it's not just the weather. It's the dome. I think it's angry at us. (tires squeal) I got Julia. You pop the trunk, plug this thing in. We need the juice. Okay. (wind whistling) Barbie! All right, let's get her inside! Put her in the second room. Yeah, right there. So, it's a through and through? Then there's no bullet to remove? That's right. Sounds like she's taking in air through the wound, so we've got to relieve this pressure, or else it's gonna crush her heart and lungs. Please, somebody, a tree fell on our garage! My husband was inside! He's not breathing! (Julia wheezing) Go get me a piece of plastic tubing so we can relieve the pressure in her chest here. This place is picked clean. I'll make do with a pen, plastic bag. Grab some alcohol. Pen, plastic bag, the alcohol. How do you know how to do all this? I had to chest tube my team sergeant in Fallujah. What happened to him? (wind whooshing) I thought everybody had to turn in their guns. I'm not everybody. Dad, what's going on? That woman Max... she's gonna take everything I worked for... and destroy it. What do you mean? Son, I've been doing my damndest to get things back to normal, make the trains run on time. Max is trying to fill those trains with drugs and liquor and every kind of sick vice human beings can get into. She seems nice enough to me. Well, that just shows you don't know what the hell you're talking about. (wind whistling) She's angry, Junior... at me. And she wants to hurt me... by hurting you. Then let me help you. I can handle this. Dad, I can help. Junior, no. I'm a man. No, I can do something! Junior. Junior, no! Single dad... ...raising a kid. (inhales deeply) I did the best I could. But you still punish me for it. I know I have, but not anymore. Look, son, with someone like Max... ...I don't know how this ends. Dad, don't say that. It's the truth. (wind whistling) You stay in the house. Do not open the door for anybody but me. Do you hear me? (thunder crashes) (thunder crashes) Lightning. I wonder if that changes anything. Okay. MAN (garbled): Imagery transmission. UHF data adapter. SATCOM. You're kidding me. It's working again. All right, come on, baby. 
(static) Speak clearly. Affirm. MAN 2: It's Barbie. We've confirmed it. Barbie? MAN 1: Yes, sir. We reviewed the tape from visitors' day. There's no question-- that's Dale Barbara in there. MAN 2: Roger that. He's the one we've been looking for. (wind whistling) (frantic knocking on door) (knocking continues) (screams) What the hell are you doing?! I could ask you the same thing. Well, don't bother shooting me! You're about to get the whole town killed! What? Junior, look at what it's doing! What is that? (droning sound) 
It's sending a message. You have to come back to the group. It takes all of us, or we're nothing! It's talking to us, Junior. To you! What, so now I control the weather? This thing has done a lot of crazy stuff, but never this. Not until you turned your back on us. 
 
 (panting) (monitor beeping) Barbie? I'm okay. (flatline tone sounds) What's happening? Her heart stopped. Too much pressure. (grunts) Uh... (slurping) What are you doing? I'm sucking out the extra air in her chest. JUNIOR: Come on, we gonna ride it out down in the shelter! No, are you nuts?! We have to go be with Joe and Norrie! My dad said to stay here. Junior, do you want to make this right? Then come with me. Not because I am promising you anything, but because the dome is telling you what you're supposed to do to be with us. We need you. You  need me, Angie. Fine. I need you. Now come on! Come on, we gotta come on! Angie! See? I was right! (flatline tone continues) (wind howling) (monitor beeping rhythmically) It worked. You did it. I had a little help, Joe. JOE: Storm's breaking up. I gotta go now. I have to tell them. You have to tell who? You saved Julia. Just like you saved me when the dome came down. Maybe you're here to save all of us. I don't think so, bud. Junior was right. The monarch's a person. That person's you. (monitor beeping rhythmically) (sobs): Oh, Mom. (monitor beeping rhythmically) BARBIE: Hey, listen. I don't want to leave her, but I gotta go take care of something, so could you... She and I aren't going anywhere. Thank you. (vehicle approaching) Julia okay? Barely. Still... you know it's Max who shot her, right? Yeah. And I also know that it's time to stop her. It's take both of us to do it. But we're gonna do this by my rules, Jim. We're taking Max alive. Oh, great. So we'll be high and mighty... and dead. That's all you know, isn't it? Kill or be killed? You're not saving Chester's Mill, you're eating this town alive. You have no idea what it takes. We do this, and then you and I... we're finished. I've spent the last two weeks trying to convince myself that we want the same thing. We do. No. I want a future. I want something that I can build towards. You want a kingdom. This town needs a leader. Not your kind. Made a few mistakes. But nobody loves this town better than I do. No, you love power, Jim. That's it. Now, we take down Max, and we are done. And then I am gonna do whatever I have to do to make sure that I knock you off of your throne. Norrie? Where's Joe? I don't know. He went to go talk to Julia and hasn't come back. Well, he must still be there, right? He wouldn't try to come back in this storm. We barely made it ourselves. Yeah, that was so weird. It came out of nowhere. Yeah, maybe not. Hey, guys. Joe! Where have you been? Where's Julia? What? She got shot. Yeah, in the chest. And then she died for a minute, but she's gonna be okay. Barbie brought her back. It was incredible. Thank God. Guys... I think he might be the monarch. The tornado went away right after he finished sucking the air out of her chest, it was... Ew. No, that's not why the storm stopped. What? It stopped because I decided to come back. Okay... Look, something started it, and something stopped it. But what do we do now? (exhales) 
We need to go to the dome. (sighs) The big dome. Right. If these stars are really us, then we have to go to the same spot on the big dome. Under the North Star... due north... That's right around the Bollingwood Bridge. And then what? I don't know. Stuff happened when we touched it together. Okay. So... the four of us need to do the exact same thing. ANGIE: Enough guessing. (sighs) The dome owes us some answers. So what's the plan? We march right in and let her ambush us? We're not going in the front door. Julia showed me another way the day the missile hit. What are you doing? I'm giving us a way out. It's just an alarm clock. The hell do we need an alarm for? (beeps) (beeping rhythmically) 
Just in case. (rhythmic beeping continues) Let's go. PHIL: Julia's car is gone. I guess Barbie took her. Oh, God. I didn't think he could ever go this far. How well do you know Barbie? I don't think anybody knows him. Julia does. Or thought she did. Peter Shumway... he was in deep. He bet the house. Literally. The house. And lost. And Barbie was the collection agent. Wasn't too polite about it, either. Do you really think... If Barbie killed Peter... And then Julia found out. I don't know about this. Would you just shut your mouth for once? (gun hammer cocks) Hello, boys. Keep walking. That's all they were packing, boss. Jim killed my mother, Barbie. I don't suppose he told you that, did he? You two are just the same. I don't think so. You and me, though... well, that's a different story. We were good together. No, we were never good. You paid me, I did a job, that's it. Well, it's a good thing you're handsome, brother, because you sure are thick sometimes. What do you mean? (voice breaks): I mean, I'm giving you a chance... to live. What, with you? Max, you shot Julia. She was never right for you, anyway. You're the one who's not right, Max. (voice catches): I had plans for you. I trusted you... and you screwed me over. You're no different from him... or from anyone else in this town. Look who's talking. No, that is not true, Jim! I am nothing like you! I am a survivor! If you have plans to be somewhere, then someone is going to be  very  disappointed. (beeping rhythmically) (beeping rapidly) 
(clanking) BARBIE: Get down! (gasps) Now we are all leaving. Let's go. Go. Julia's here, but Barbie's gone. They said that he took off with Big Jim. Could be at the cement factory. Max set up a fight club there. Heard people say they lost money on Barbie yesterday. Get out. Come on. Linda, you cannot do this by yourself, man. You're not a cop, Phil. I'll see you soon. You're stealing my car. I'll go get our car. I'll take them down to the station. You don't want to do this, I promise. I already took care of your little insurance policy. (scoffs) 
You have no idea. It's over. What the hell did you do?! As long as Max is breathing, she's a threat. Now she's not. And neither are you. (groans) (gun cocks) 
LINDA: Barbie, put that weapon down! Put it down now! BIG JIM: Linda, thank God! He's gone nuts! He's lying to you! BIG JIM: He killed 'em! First he cuffed 'em, and then he shot 'em in the head! I was next! Back up, Barbie. Put the weapon down. Put your hands behind your back. You killed your last victim. Spread your legs apart. You're done. Linda, I'm telling you... (Linda gasps) Stop, or I'll shoot! Shoot that son of a bitch! (dry firing) BIG JIM:  Am I set? Two secs. Almost there. Hey, Jim? Yeah? I heard something today. From the outside. It was about Barbie. What are you talking about? It was the military. They know he's in here. Tell me exactly what they said. They said that he's the one. The one that they've been looking for. Turn it on. This is Jim Rennie. I'm sorry to report that this has been a very dark day in Chester's Mill. I need all citizens to be aware and vigilant. Today, Maxine Seagrave and her business associate Otto Aguilar were murdered, shot execution style. Many of you may have known Max. She was a reputable businesswoman from Westlake. In addition, an attempt was made on the life of Julia Shumway. She suffered a gunshot to the chest and may not survive. There was also an attempt made on my own life. One person is responsible for all this... Dale "Barbie" Barbara. A warrant has been issued for his arrest. He's been charged with the attempted murders of Mrs. Shumway and myself. He's also been charged with the murders of Max Seagrave, Otto Aguilar, and Ms. Seagraves mother, Agatha. Barbie is on the run. He is armed and dangerous, and for those reasons, I'm declaring a state of emergency. This senseless violence will not be tolerated. What Barbie did is not who we are. Even now. Especially now. When Barbie is taken into custody, he'll be given a fair trial. The government, ANGIE: Any bets on what will happen when the four of us touch it? All I want is answers. Not a seizure or riddle. Just answers. All right, whatever happens, don't let go. (soft zapping) (zapping stops) ♪ Dad? Dad! Junior. No! Dad! I gotta go find my dad. Wait! Did we all see the same thing? Big Jim? Yeah. What the hell was that? I-I thought we were coming here for answers. We were, Joe. I think that was it. What was it? Maybe the dome's coming down. First... Big Jim has to die. And I think we're supposed to do it.
