 When you find that one person who connects you to the world, you become someone different. 
 Someone better. 
 When that person is taken from you... 
 What do you become then? 
 Whatever he wanna do, you know? 
 [Grunts] 
 What? Hmm? 
 Where'd you get that, in a cereal box? 
 Huh? You wanna see a real gun? 
 Forget you. 
 Every little punk is carrying now, Anton. 
 That's why your father wanted us to take the car home. 
 Relax. 
 We're picking up new hardware next week. 
 Restore a little order. 
 Besides, when we take the car, we don't get to meet new friends. 
 Look at this guy. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You didn't bring enough for the whole group. 
 I have to teach you about sharing. 
 Aah! 
 [Rapid computer blips] 
 [Overlapping conversations] 
 I'll need a statement from the bum. What hospital did they take him to? 
 He declined treatment. We got video on it, though. 
 You know, you could have done me a favor and let those guys land a couple more punches. 
 Question for you. 
 Looking at that tape, I'd say you spent some time in the service. 
 But you don't learn how to fight like that in the regular army. 
 So what were you, special forces? 
 Delta? 
 I'm Carter. You didn't give us a name. 
 You know, it's funny. 
 Seems like the only time you need a name now is when you're in trouble. 
 So am I in trouble? 
 I don't know, you tell me. 
 You're the one living on the street. 
 Yeah, making that transition back can be tough. 
 Some guys I knew got a little lost, needed a little help adjusting. 
 You need some help? 
 Of course, some other guys I knew, they'd done so many evil things, they felt like they needed the punishment. 
 That sound more like your story? 
 Excuse me for a second. 
 I'm here for my client. 
 Wow. 
 Wow, wow. 
 Your guy's prints were found in half a dozen crime scenes over the years. 
 Open warrants in four different countries. 
 Who you got down there, Carter, the angel of death? 
 I appreciate the help, counselor. 
 But who's picking up... The tab? 
 Our employer wants to have a word with you. 
 [Distant sirens blare] 
 [Radio static, overlapping conversations] 
 Do I owe you money? 
 'Cause I'm, uh... 
 Running a little short at the moment. 
 You don't owe me anything, Mr. Reese. 
 That's the name you prefer, isn't it? 
 I know you've had several. 
 Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell anybody about you. 
 You don't know anything about me. 
 I know exactly everything about you, Mr. Reese. 
 I know about the work you used to do for the government. 
 I know about the doubts you came to have about that work. 
 I know that the government, along with everybody else, thinks you're dead. 
 I know you've spent the last couple of months trying to drink yourself to death. 
 I know you're contemplating more efficient ways to do it. 
 So you see, knowledge is not my problem. 
 Doing something with that knowledge... 
 That's where you'd come in. 
 And you can call me Mr. Finch. 
 I think you and I can help one another. 
 I don't think you need a psychiatrist or a support group, or pills... 
 What do I need? 
 You need a purpose. 
 More specifically, you need a job. 
 Eight million people. 
 You know what they all have in common? 
 None of them knows what happens next. 
 Someone is murdered in New York City every 18 hours. 
 At the end of the day, one of these people will be gone. 
 Bad things happen to people every day. 
 You can't stop that. 
 What if you could? 
 Not the things that happen in the heat of the moment. 
 But so many crimes are planned days, weeks in advance. 
 What if you could stop those? 
 I've got a list. 
 A list of people who are about to be involved in very bad situations. 
 Murders, kidnappings. 
 The people that are on my list, they have no idea that anything's about to happen to them. 
 Most of them are just ordinary people like her. 
 Thank you. 
 Her name is Diane Hansen, and this week she's at the top of my list. 
 I don't know exactly what's going to happen or what her role in it is. 
 She might be the victim. She could be the perpetrator. 
 All I know is that she's involved. 
 I want you to follow her, figure out what's gonna to happen, and stop it from happening. 
 So what do you think? 
 I think you're a bored rich guy. 
 I think that woman's probably your ex-wife or someone you rode in an elevator with once. 
 And either way, I think I'm done. 
 [Radio static, overlapping conversations] 
 Tonight police are looking for a homeless man for further questioning. 
 The unidentified man was originally believed to be the victim of a violent assault on the subway. 
 But now police consider the man a person of interest in a number of crimes nationwide. 
 [Samurai fighting on tv] 
 Hey, sweetheart, what's wrong? 
 Jess, what's wrong? 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 You need to understand, Mr. Reese, the information I have is incomplete, but it's never wrong. 
 You need to know what it would be like to be forced to listen to someone get murdered, and not be able to do anything about it. 
 [Phone hangs up] 
 [Woman screaming] 
 [Glass shatters, furniture thuds] 
 [Voice on speaker] 
 ...One three eight dot seven X-ray. 
 12 August, 2008. 
 1:37 A.M. 
 Too late. 
 This recording is three years old. 
 A woman murdered in this room by her husband. 
 For the insurance. 
 You were too late for her. 
 Just like you were too late for your friend Jessica. 
 You were halfway around the world when she was killed. 
 What the hell do you know about it? 
 It's the truth. You left the government because they lied to you-- 
 I never will. 
 I think all you ever wanted to do was protect people. 
 It's a wire-tap recording. 
 NSA or FISA. Government. 
 But you're not government. 
 No, I'm not. 
 I guess you could call me a concerned third party. 
 You couldn't have saved this woman... 
 Or your friend. 
 But you could have if you had have known in time. 
 And that's the other thing I'm offering you, a chance to be there in time. 
 It's not too late for her. 
 You could help me stop what's about to happen. 
 The question is, will you? 
 What is this place? 
 The decline of Western civilization. 
 The city closed half its libraries. 
 Budget cuts. 
 This building was sold to a bank that I control, which promptly declared bankruptcy. 
 So the property's in a kind of limbo. 
 It doesn't exist. 
 Neither do you. I did a little digging. 
 I recognize, Mr. Reese, that there's a disparity between how much I know about you and how much you know about me. 
 I know you'll be trying to close that gap as quickly as possible. 
 But I should tell you I'm a really private person. 
 Drivers licenses... Credit cards. 
 Six cover identities. 
 Funds to be replenished through a proxy corporation. 
 Just like when you were with the agency. 
 When I was with the agency I knew who was picking up the tab. 
 This is your list? 
 The  list? 
 Yeah. 
 But you don't get names, do you? 
 These are social security numbers. 
 And each of them map out to a violent crime. 
 And all of these numbers represent... 
 Lost chances. 
 I could be a lot more help to you if you just tell me where you're getting these numbers. 
 It doesn't really matter where I get the numbers. 
 What you need to know is that the next number that's up is hers. 
 Diane Hansen. 
 Grew up in Detroit. 
 Moved to the city after law school. 
 Single. 
 She have any enemies? 
 One or two. 
 She's an assistant district attorney. 
 Best conviction record in her department. 
 We have no idea when this bad thing might happen, huh? 
 Could be in a week. Could be five minutes. 
 That's why we need to learn as much as we can about her. 
 How do you intend to begin? 
 The slow way. 
 Cultivate a relationship to allow you to earn the asset's trust. 
 And the fast way? 
 First, you break into their home and go through all their stuff. 
 Email, financial records, personal effects. 
 [Computer beeping rapidly] 
 Then you hack into their cell phone. 
 As long as it's charged and has signal, you can use the GPS to track them. 
 You can use the microphone to listen into their conversations whether they're talking on the phone or not. 
 Hi, mom. I'm sorry I haven't called you back... 
 Third step-- 
 You need picture. 
 A wireless camera, and you can keep an eye on them from anywhere. 
 I know you're worried. I know. I'm fine. 
 It is a tough job, but I can look after myself. 
 You know that. 
 She's tough, but she's scared about something. 
 Given Hansen's job, we've got hundreds of people who could be holding a grudge. 
 I cut the list to two. 
 The first is Wheeler, her co-counselor. 
 They dated for a few months last year. 
 She broke things off. 
 You got time to talk? Maybe I can buy you dinner. 
 I'm busy. Another time? 
 Is something wrong? I've been noticing lately-- 
 No, I'm fine, thank you. Thanks. 
 And 40% of murders involve some kind of romantic relationship. 
 Wheeler's divorced. One kid. 
 Partial custody, alimony. Career stalled. 
 The second person I'm looking into is Lawrence Pope. 
 The man Hansen is currently prosecuting. 
 Pope's on trial for killing his friends in a drug deal gone bad. 
 Stole $1/2 million in cash. 
 Pope's gang may be targeting her for reprisal. 
 When we got there, the scene was colorful. 
 Five dead. 
 One of them had managed to crawl ten feet to a phone to dial 911. 
 Detective Fusco, when you interviewed Mr. Pope, what did he tell you in his defense? 
 He said that if he'd have shot the poor b*st*rd, he would have shot him in the head. 
 Quote, "Same as I always do," unquote. 
 He said he wouldn't have left him there half-dead, blubbering for his girlfriend. 
 No more questions, your honor. 
 Detective... 
 You went a little off script in your testimony. 
 You never told me about that conversation, and it could clear Pope's name. 
 What's it matter? We got the guy. 
 It matters because it's my job to make absolutely sure that the wrong people don't go to jail. 
 Do you remember? 
 Excuse me, I thought we were on the same team. 
 Something's gone wrong with her case. 
 Hansen's on the move. 
 She's phoning county lockup, arranging a meeting with Pope...Alone. 
 Isn't my lawyer supposed to be here for this? 
 I can call him if you want, but the reason I'm here is I don't think you murdered those people. 
 I think somebody else was in the house when that 911 call was made. 
 Somebody who told you what was said, which means you weren't there. 
 Is it somebody you're trying to protect? 
 You gonna help me? Is that it? 
 The person who knows what happened that night must be somebody you care about. 
 Is it your younger brother Michael? 
 Pope's got a brother. It's in his case file. 
 Got it. 
 Did he see the real killers? 
 You should leave this alone, lady. 
 I can do the time. 
 These people are evil, killing when they want. 
 And they're protected from on high. 
 You keep asking questions, they'll kill me and my brother, and probably you too. 
 Whoever these people are, you can trust me. 
 We'll take care of you and your brother. 
 If the killers are out there, I'm gonna find them, whether you help me or not. 
 It's my job. Now, why don't you-- 
 Bitch, you keep your damn mouth shut, or I'll shut it for you! 
 [Cell door buzzes] 
 I'm fine. 
 Okay. She's okay. She's okay. 
 Finch, you were right about Hansen. 
 Whoever framed Pope will be coming after her, and only Pope's brother Michael knows who they are. 
 Hi, mom, it's Jessica. 
 I'm just down in Mexico with Cindy, and I'll be back tomorrow. Okay? 
 Talk soon. Bye. 
 Cindy? 
 Yeah. 
 I look like a Cindy? 
 Yeah. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I didn't tell her about us yet. 
 It's been six months. 
 I wish this weekend could go on forever. 
 It already has. It's Tuesday. 
 Yes, which means that you have to go back to the base, and I'm not gonna see you again for two weeks, which I hate. 
 Then ask me to stay, and I will. 
 I'll quit. I'll quit. 
 Okay. 
 I'll quit. 
 Then quit. 
 I already did. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 I didn't want to take the chance that you wouldn't be here when I got back. 
 [Laughing] 
 But first, we need some more Tequila. 
 Unh! 
 Estamos recibiendo informes que unos aviones se han estrellado  contra las dos torres gemelas del World Trade Center en Manhattan. 
 
 
 
 Hey, sweetheart, what's wrong? 
 Jess...What's wrong? 
 Uh, it's New York. I don't know. I don't know. 
 Something's happened this morning. 
 Is it a plane crash? 
 I think it's two. I think it's two planes. 
 [Man continues in spanish] 
 [Radio static, overlapping conversations] 
 All right, thanks. 
 You went to see Pope last night? 
 Yeah. I gave him one more chance to turn in his accomplice, cut a deal. 
 He give you anything? 
 No. As usual. 
 I'm, uh-- I'm late. 
 She's trying to track down Pope's brother Michael. 
 He can ID the real killers. 
 And she's stonewalling Wheeler. 
 What, does she think he's involved? 
 Remember, Pope said they were protected from on high. 
 Wait a second. 
 Turns out there's a good reason she doesn't trust Wheeler. 
 He might be working with the killers. 
 And they're after Michael Pope. 
 We better get to this kid before someone else does. 
 [Radio static, overlapping conversations] 
 [School bell rings] 
 Michael...Can I talk to you for a second? 
 [Tires screech] 
 I've got a message from your brother. 
 You don't know my brother. 
 Not exactly. 
 But I know what you saw. 
 I'm not the only one looking for you. 
 You need to come with me. 
 Hey! Hey, help me. 
 Hey, this man is trying to put me in a taxi cab with him! 
 He's trying to take pictures of me. 
 What's going on? 
 How you doing? 
 Michael Pope's still on the subway. 
 When he comes up for air, you can use the GPS on your phone to find him. 
 If Pope's right about these guys, I'm gonna need a hell of a lot more than a cell phone. 
 About that, I don't like firearms very much. 
 Well, neither do I, but if someone has to have them, I'd rather it was me. 
 Besides, my friend from the subway has a line on some. 
 Lightly used. 
 Steep discount.

 You're crazy. 
 We're both dead now. 
 Do you know who they are? 
 I do now. 
 Cops. Come on. 
 What exactly have you gotten me into? 
 I don't know. 
 That's the whole point. 
 I hired you to help me figure that out. 
 Here. 
 I think we're up against a group of corrupt cops. 
 Stills is narcotics. 
 Him and his men get word of deals. 
 They steal the drugs, the cash, and they kill all the witnesses. 
 And they get Fusco to frame up guys like Lawrence Pope for the murders. 
 Exactly. 
 I think their next target is Hansen. 
 But I don't know for certain. 
 Hell, I don't know anything for certain, because you won't tell me where you're getting your information. 
 When the towers came down, you were in a hotel in Mexico. 
 I was here. 
 I was working. 
 Didn't even know about the attacks until that evening. 
 You see, Mr. Reese, until that day, I had spent the better part of my life making myself very rich. 
 Suddenly all that money didn't seem to amount to much. 
 After the attacks, the government gave itself the power to read every email, listen to every cell phone, but they needed something that could sort through it all, something that could pick the terrorists out of the general population before they could act. 
 The public wanted to be protected. 
 They just didn't want to know how they were being protected. 
 So when they finally got a system that worked, they kept it secret. 
 So how do you know about it? 
 I built it. 
 But there was a problem with this machine. 
 I had built it to prevent the next 9/11. 
 But it was seeing all sorts of crimes. 
 So I had to teach the machine to divide the things it saw into two lists: Relevant and irrelevant. 
 Events that would cause massive loss of life were relevant, so those would be passed along to the NSA or the FBI. 
 And the irrelevant information? 
 Every night at midnight, the machine erases it. 
 It was only later that I realized my mistake. 
 That irrelevant list was eating away at me. 
 So where's the machine now? 
 What, the drives? Who knows? 
 Government facility somewhere. 
 But the machine? 
 The machine is everywhere. 
 Watching us with 10,000 eyes. 
 Listening with a million ears. 
 What did I tell you about sending email? 
 Three weeks, you could practically move in. 
 Never put anything in an email you cannot own. 
 You gave yourself a way to communicate with it? 
 I was building the government a tool of unimaginable power. 
 I thought maybe an off switch would come in handy. 
 So I built myself a back door into it. 
 To access the irrelevant list. 
 Just a social security number. 
 If anyone ever found out, I'd lose access so... 
 Nine digits, that's all we get. 
 And we have no idea why it picked Diane Hansen. 
 It wouldn't be steering us toward her if it wasn't seeing something. 
 But I don't know if I can protect Hansen. 
 I can't see the whole picture.
