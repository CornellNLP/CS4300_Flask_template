 You are being watched. 
 The government has a secret system-- 
 A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. 
 I know, because I built it. 
 I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything... 
 Violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you, crimes the government considered irrelevant. 
 They wouldn't act, so I decided I would. 
 But I needed a partner-- Someone with the skills to intervene. 
 Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret. 
 You will never find us. 
 But, victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.

 When you find that one person who connects you to the world, you become someone different... 
 Someone better. 
 When that person is taken from you... 
 Wait for me. 
 What do you become then? 
 Are you okay, mister? 
 What happened to you? 
 I think I quit my job. 
 [Over PA] 
 Next stop, New Rochelle. 
 Morning, Finch. 
 You're off to an early start, Mr. Reese. 
 Maybe I'm trying to impress the boss. 
 Should have called first. 
 As it stands, our docket is clear. 
 We don't have a number? 
 You sound disappointed. 
 Oh, a little surprised. 
 No one in New York is in danger or planning to hurt someone? 
 If they are, they're keeping it to themselves. 
 Anyway, I think you've earned some time off. 
 Especially today. 
 Or did you think I didn't know? 
 Happy Birthday. 
 Thanks. 
 You're welcome. Now go. 
 Do whatever you do when you're not here. 
 Obviously.

 [Chuckles] 
 Are you sure? 
 You tell me, Han. 
 As I recall, John, you don't make any move you're not sure of. 
 You're not working today? 
 My boss gave me the day off. 
 It's my birthday. 
 Sheng ri kuai le. 
 Thank you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Did you get any gifts? 
 One. 
 A key? 
 To what? 
 Good question. 
 Detective Carter. 
 Special Agent Donnelly. 
 How goes your hunt for our mystery man? 
 That's why I'm here. 
 I promised I'd keep you in the loop on our investigation. 
 [Briefcase locks click] 
 So... we'd been looking into a smuggling ring that was broken up a couple of months back. 
 The leader was suspected of having CIA ties, but he skipped before he could be charged. 
 I recall. 
 Yeah, well, we think your guy was working for him. 
 CSU found prints and some carbonized blood, along with the body of a member of the ring, in the trunk of a burned-out car. 
 When they ran the blood, they got a DNA hit on a cold case up in New Rochelle from 2011. 
 What kind of cold case? 
 Suspected homicide. 
 Real estate developer named Peter Arndt. 
 Real estate developer? 
 Yeah. Arndt was up to his eyeballs in debt. 
 Lost his investors' money. 
 We think one of them had him taken out, hired your guy to do the job. 
 And he made some mistakes. 
 Now someone in New Rochelle has to know something, and then we'll be close. 
 Close to what? 
 Finding out who this man really is. 
 Well, um, thank you for the update. 
 How'd you like to assist? 
 Assist? 
 Up in New Rochelle. 
 I would love to, but, uh-- 
 Think about it. 
 I mean, you're the reason we're onto this guy. 
 [Cell phone rings] You should be a part of taking him down. 
 I'll let you know. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 Hello, detective? 
 There's something I need to discuss with you. 
 Yeah? 
 I got something for you too. 
 [ ♪ ] 
 Never pegged you as the cues-and-brews type. 
 All the more reason to come here, detective. 
 Once we become predictable, we become vulnerable. 
 If you say so. 
 What can I get you? 
 Uh, club soda for me. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 When I called, you said you had something for me. 
 You know about a case up in New Rochelle? 
 I'll take that as a "yes." 
 FBI linked your your partner's DNA to a crime scene. 
 Agent Donnelly, no doubt. 
 He wants me along for the ride. 
 Perhaps that wouldn't be such a bad thing? 
 How do you mean? 
 Well, if there was any evidence that threatened our mutual friend, I'm confident that you would find it before Donnelly would. 
 Are you suggesting I obstruct a federal investigation? 
 Of course what you did with that evidence would be entirely your concern. 
 You wanted to talk to me about something. 
 Oh, it was nothing important. 
 We'll talk again when you get back. 
 Thanks for the drink. 
 Anything else? 
 No, I'll just take the check, please. 
 Okay. 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 This is Jessica, you missed me. 
 Leave a message. 
 Do you need any help? 
 Yes. 
 I'm looking for someone. 
 A nurse. 
 Jessica Arndt. 
 I'm an old friend. 
 She might not work here anymore. 
 She was always talking about moving away. 
 Um, I'm sorry to have to tell you this. 
 Jessica died in a car accident. 
 About two months ago. 
 [ ♪ ] 
 She said she would wait. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I think I have her husband's number here, if you wanted to reach out. 
 [ ♪ ] 
 [Wheelchair clatters] 
 Sorry. 
 Has she left the apartment? 
 Not yet. 
 Hey, what's your interest in this broad anyway, Finch? 
 It's not your concern. 
 Just keep an eye out. 
 [Beep] Karen Garner. 
 She's wanted for identity theft, passing bad checks. 
 Warrant's out of Detroit. 
 Your girl's a felon. 
 Yes, I'm aware of her apparent troubles with the law, detective. 
 But I'm more concerned that she may be in danger. 
 What makes you think that? 
 Karen Garner is an alias. 
 It's only been around for three months. 
 She has no credit history, she only leaves the apartment to go to work, and she's constantly looking over her shoulder. 
 Sounds like she's hiding out. 
 Or on the run, more likely. 
 Maybe she's laying low, trying to plan something. 
 Yes, perhaps she's a master criminal. 
 But maybe she's just a scared woman trying to stay a step ahead of her abuser. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Let me ask you something, though. 
 Why am I planted out here instead of wonder boy? 
 Mr. Reese is otherwise engaged. 
 And you are not to contact him regarding this matter, detective. 
 You and I will handle this ourselves. 
 [Sports announcer speaking on TV indistinct] 
 Detective Carter, welcome to New Rochelle. 
 Glad to see you took me up on my offer. 
 Here's what we know. 
 Arndt was playing it fast and loose with his investors' money. 
 He ended up losing it on bad land deals and a gambling habit. 
 When he exhausted his line of credit, he was forced to take money from less reputable lenders. 
 Loan sharks. 
 His bookie gave us the name of a couple local guys he introduced Arndt to, and we're checking it out. 
 Says he was married. 
 "Wife deceased." 
 What happened to her? 
 In a car accident. 
 Two months before Arndt went missing. 
 Bad one. 
 She was killed, he nearly was. 
 But anyway, by that point, Arndt was completely under water. 
 Shortly after he left the hospital, he went missing. 
 They find a body? 
 No, but given the amount of blood spilled, it's doubtful Arndt survived. 
 Doesn't sound like my guy's MO. 
 He usually covers his tracks. 
 That's another reason we think it was his first job. 
 It was messy, violent. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Probably figured it would be easy, then found out he had a fight on his hands. 
 We located one of the loan sharks. 
 Did you talk to the local detectives? 
 No, I had their files sent over. 
 I'd like to speak with them. 
 Sure. Great. Let me know if you find out anything. 
 Will do. 
 Anything yet, detective? 
 Yep. Our girl's on her way to work. 
 And you're right. 
 Someone's got this girl spooked. 
 How long am I gonna have to tail her? 
 Long enough for me to identify who she's hiding from. 
 Hey, did you see a woman come through here? 
 Yes, she asked to use the bathroom in the back. - Detective? 
 Hang on. 
 [ ♪ ] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 So if I were to speculate as to the reason for your labored breathing, detective-- 
 I lost her. 
 That would be it. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Go back to your day job. 
 I'll handle it from here. 
 Hey. What can I get you? 
 Oh, just some information. 
 I was in here last night and I thought I saw my neighbour working here-- 
 Karen Garner? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 I was passing by again, I thought I'd see if I could catch her. 
 Normally you would but she called out today. 
 Another time then. 
 I'm sure I'll see her around. 
 Excuse me. 
 I couldn't help overhear your conversation at the bar. 
 You're friends with Karen Garner? 
 Well, more of an acquaintance, actually. 
 Brad Jennings, US Marshals Service. 
 Is Karen in some kind of trouble, Deputy? 
 Karen Garner, also known as Sarah Atkins, is a wanted fugitive. 
 I'm trying to locate her. 
 Sorry, I don't know how I could help you. 
 Well, I thought I heard you say you were neighbors. 
 Yes, you did. 
 So maybe you could tell me where you live, Mr.-- 
 I'm sorry, Deputy, I prefer not to get involved. 
 I'm not asking you to get involved. 
 I'm just trying to get your address. 
 Now, if you prefer, we can do this down at the field office. 
 Hello, Harold. 
 Detective Stills-- 
 Organized Crime. 
 This guy you're talking to is my CI. 
 He's a Confidential Informant? 
 And money launderer for the late Don Moretti. 
 Hey, I've got some questions for him. 
 You were risking his cover by even approaching him. 
 Let's go. 
 What did he want? 
 Just to ask me some questions. 
 Funny, I've got a few of those for you too, Harold. 
 [Car door shuts] 
 [Tires squeal] 
 So am I to assume that you were following me? 
 I think the bigger question is... Are you working a case without me? 
 I feared that, with this case, you had certain sensitivities. 
 I thought it best to let you sit it out. 
 What kind of sensitivities? 
 Her name-- or at least her aliases... Are Karen Garner and Sarah Atkins. 
 She has outstanding warrants for identity theft and passing bad checks, but I don't think she's a potential perpetrator. 
 I believe that she's on the run from someone. 
 Who? 
 Likely someone she was close to. 
 When I was first building the machine, I kept seeing the same numbers come up-- a week, a month, six months apart. 
 Usually women. 
 At first I thought it was a mistake. 
 How could anyone's life be repeatedly threatened? 
 And then I realized... They were living with the person who would eventually kill them. 
 I've been working to uncover who she really is. 
 It might help us identify the threat. 
 Send me her address and we'll finish discussing my sensitivities later. 
 [ ♪ ] 
 Hello, Karen. 
 Or do you prefer Sarah? 
 Who the hell are you? 
 Someone who wants to help you. 
 You a cop? 
 No. 
 But I know you're running from someone. 
 Who is it? 
 Boyfriend? 
 Ex-boyfriend? 
 Husband? 
 Husband. 
 I'm going to ask you one last time. 
 Who are you? 
 My name's John. 
 And I help people out of tough situations. 
 What do you know about my situation? 
 I know it was bad enough for you to leave your home, your life, everything. And I know you'll have to keep running, Karen... 
 If nobody stops him. 
 It's Sarah. 
 My name is Sarah. 
 What if I said you could stop running, Sarah? 
 I'd say you don't know my husband. 
 Mr. Reese, I traced Karen's former alias-- Sarah Atkins-- 
 To a Chicago apartment where she was living. 
 Building manager said she paid rent using checks with a different name. 
 He's sending me one of them now. 
 Sarah Jennings. 
 Jennings-- He's her husband. 
 He's the Marshal. 
 How did you know that? 
 That's not important. 
 What's important is we can help you. 
 We? 
 I have a colleague who will watch over you while I take care of things. 
 We need you to stay here. 
 What is it you're gonna do? 
 Make it so you don't have to be afraid anymore. 
 That's everything we have on Peter Arndt. 
 Thanks. 
 Did this look like a professional hit to you, detective? 
 It's hard to say. 
 We don't get a lot of contract killings up this way. 
 But this guy Arndt owed a lot of money to some dangerous people. 
 And this? 
 Accident report from a car crash Arndt and his wife were in. 
 Single car. 
 Husband swerved to avoid a deer. 
 Wife was killed. 
 It's a hell of a thing. 
 Guy survives a crash like that only to get taken out two months later. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 I got to take this. 
 Thank you. 
 [Alarm chirps] 
 No new messages. 
 To listen to saved messages, press 9. 
 [Female voice] It's me. 
 Jessica, I mean. 
 I don't even know if you check this number. 
 Um, I need to talk. 
 Oh, you scared me. 
 Who are you calling? 
 Nobody. 
 That's funny. 
 It sounded like you were calling somebody. 
 [Bottle pops open] 
 Jessica Arndt. 
 Pretty girl. 
 Dead on the scene. 
 Blunt force head injury from the rollover. 
 No seat belt. 
 Do you still have her x-rays? 
 Uh... [beep] 
 Arndt. 
 There we go. 
 In your report, you identified two previous fractures-- 
 A broken wrist and cracked rib. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 May I? 
 Is that a spiral fracture? 
 I suppose it is. 
 She'd get that from having her wrist twisted-- 
 Hard-- As opposed to falling on it, right? 
 Come here. 
 You're hurting me. 
 One other thing. 
 You listed her cause of death as... Blunt force trauma to the head and a broken neck. 
 As I said. 
 Could someone suffer those kinds of injuries if the car's front and side air bags deployed? 
 Not likely, but a body is, uh, subjected to extreme forces in a crash like that. 
 Is it possible she could have had these injuries before the accident? 
 You're hurting my arm. 
 
 
 
 Get back here! 
 [Grunts] 
 No, no. 
 Baby. Baby. 
 Jess. 
 Hey. 
 [Clank] 
 [Cell phone dials] 
 Detective, I don't know what cases you're used to seeing down in Manhattan, but up here, car crashes account for most of my business. 
 Just because something's possible doesn't mean it's probable. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Excuse me. 
 Carter. 
 Detective, I'm heading up to speak with Arndt's closest family-- 
 His mother-in-law. 
 See if she knew anything about his money problems. 
 Send me the address. I'll meet you there. 
 All right. Will do. 
 I'm watching Sarah's apartment and I'm tracking the GPS on her phone, Mr. Reese. 
 I've also discovered some new information about her husband. 
 According to the Denver Public Records Database, Jennings was sued twice for excessive use of force on the job. 
 Both cases were dismissed. 
 He falsified the warrants on Sarah. 
 Trumped up the charges to enlist the entire US Marshal Service in helping him stalk his wife. 
 That's why she can't stop running. 
 Only one way to deal with guys like this, guys who hide who they really are until they get home. 
 What will you do, Mr. Reese? 
 Show 'em what a real monster looks like. 
 Detective... uh, what was it? 
 Stills? 
 You have a change of heart about me quest-- [Grunts] 
 Your fellow deputies know why you're here? 
 Chasing your terrified wife? 
 If you come after her again... I will kill you. 
 No one will be able to protect you from me. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Do you understand? 
 Finch, we're gonna want to move Sarah to a safer location. 
 Agreed. 
 And then maybe you can explain the wisdom of antagonizing an entire law enforcement agency. 
 Mr. Reese, we have a problem. 
 Hi. 
 Uh, one way to New Haven, please. 
 Sure. Just need photo ID. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Is something wrong? 
 Stop right there! 
 Get down on the ground! 
 Karen Garner, we have a warrant for your arrest! 
 Suspect in custody, track 20. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Yes, detective. 
 I just heard on the radio your girl got popped. 
 Down at the train station. 
 They picked her up on a Marshal's BOLO. 
 Where is she now? 
 Probably still there. 
 Transit cops will hold her till the Marshals can pick her up. 
 Thanks, detective. 
 Have to get to the train station. 
 We're too late. Jennings already picked her up. 
 With his cover blown, he can't take her home through official channels. 
 He's gonna make her disappear, Finch. 
 We need to get to her. 
 I may have a way. 
 Government vehicles now have mobile hotspots for Internet access-- 
 Like this one. 
 That include Marshal vehicles? 
 Yes. 
 So I can get into their network. 
 The trick will be figuring out which vehicle is Jennings'. 
 [Beeping] 
 That's him. 
 West Side highway. 
 He's taking her out of the city. 
 Get out. 
 Excuse me? 
 Leave the laptop now, Harold. 
 And get out. 
 [Tires squeal] 
 Your daughter was so beautiful. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Were you two close? 
 Very. 
 We spoke most every day. 
 So you said you had some questions about Peter? 
 Uh, yes, ma'am. 
 Uh, prior to his disappearance, were you aware of your son-in-law's financial difficulties? 
 No. 
 Peter had a good job. 
 He was a good provider. 
 Based on our information, he owed more than $3 million to various entities. 
 Well, Jessica once mentioned that they were going through a rough patch. 
 But that Peter was turning things around. 
 That was just before the accident. 
 [Cell phone rings] Excuse me. 
 When you said Jessica told you "they were going through a rough patch," was she talking about money, or her and Peter? 
 Oh, no. 
 Jessica and Peter had a good marriage. 
 I mean, they had problems, like any married couple, but-- - Detective. 
 See you a minute? 
 I just got a call that a guy in a suit assaulted four deputy Marshals in their downtown field office. 
 Wait. What? 
 I know. 
 I'm heading back down there to follow up. 
 Do you mind wrapping things up with the mother? 
 It looks like a dead end. 
 Sure. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Detective Carter. 
 What's this about an incident with four deputy Marshals? 
 I've got it under control. 
 Are you sure? 
 'Cause it doesn't sound like it. 
 Yes, detective. 
 So how is your New Rochelle investigation going? 
 Donnelly hasn't found anything so far, but I think I have. 
 Oh? 
 Yeah, I think Arndt killed his wife and covered it up. 
 The kind of thing you guys usually intervene in, except this time your partner was too late. 
 Still don't understand John's connection to this. 
 Are you sure there isn't anything you can tell me? 
 I'm sure you'll make sense of it, detective. 
 [Liquid pours] 
 You were saying something about problems between Jessica and Peter. 
 Oh, you know, just little spats. 
 Not even worth mentioning. 
 Do you know if these spats ever went beyond words? 
 I'm not sure what you mean. 
 Did they become physical? 
 What is it you're suggesting? 
 Nothing. 
 Just some routine questions. 
 I should get going. 
 I'm sorry for troubling you. 
 Peter had his faults, but he loved Jessica. 
 And she loved him. 
 I'm sure she did, ma'am. 
 He was so much better than her... usual type. 
 She was seeing someone before Peter? 
 She had a fling with a soldier. 
 Back when she was living in Tacoma. 
 This soldier-- Do you remember his name? 
 No. 
 They weren't together very long. 
 He was always away on duty, and then she'd be alone. 
 That wasn't the life for her. 
 He told her the same thing-- 
 Told her not to wait for him. 
 However, sometimes I now wonder... If she had waited for him, maybe things could have worked out, maybe she would be happy. 
 And we'd talk again. 
 Can I ask, do you have any pictures of this man? 
 I don't. 
 But I still have some of Jessica's things. 
 You're welcome to look through them if you like. 
 Sure. 
 Jessica. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I got engaged. 
 His name's Peter. 
 [Overlapping chatter] 
 That's one of the things you learn over there. 
 In the end, we're all alone. 
 And no one's coming to save you. 
 Be happy with Peter. 
 You don't believe that? 
 Tell me to wait for you and... Say those words and I will. 
 [Overlapping chattering] 
 Hey, cheers. 
 In the end, we're all alone. 
 And no one's coming to save you. 
 Gene? 
 Hey. 
 Joss Carter. 
 Good. 
 Listen, I need a favor. 
 Yeah, personnel file-- 
 First name John. 
 Special Forces. 
 Stationed at Fort Lewis between between June and September of '01. 
 My eyes only. 
 Yeah, thanks, Gene. 
 Mr. Reese. 
 What is it, Finch? 
 What exactly is your plan once you catch up to Deputy Jennings? 
 To get Sarah away from him. 
 And Jennings? 
 Jennings had his chance. 
 He didn't take it. 
 I think, under the circumstances, it might be a good idea to bring the police in on this one. 
 Finch, you hired me to take care of these things. 
 You don't like how I do it, hire someone else. 
 Mr. Reese? 
 John? 
 Carter. 
 Hello, detective. 
 This New Rochelle business-- The car accident, the cover up, Jessica. 
 You knew what I'd find, didn't you? 
 Knowing isn't always a blessing, detective. 
 True. 
 But, I confess, I was calling with a more urgent problem-- John. 
 Don't tell me you've lost him again. 
 No, I know where he is. I just... can't reach him. 
 Or stop him. 
 Why are we here, Brad? 
 I wanted us to have some time together, baby. 
 Just you and me. 
 I don't know how things got so out of hand with us. 
 But, I promise, I'm going to fix it. 
 You don't have to run anymore. 
 You believe me... right? 
 I do. 
 I do believe you, I do believe-- Mmm. 
 Both: [Panting] 
 So maybe we can take these off now? 
 [Grunts] 
 You never did know what to say, did you? 
 I know what you're thinking. 
 That this is my fault. 
 That, somehow, I wanted this. 
 But have you ever considered how hard this has been for me? 
 The trouble I've gone through for you? 
 What's it gonna take, Sarah? 
 I love you so much. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 But I can't do this anymore. 
 [Sobs] 
 [Phone rings] 
 [Gasps, cries] 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Sobbing] 
 Go. 
 Where? 
 Anywhere you want. 
 You're free. 
 Thank you. 
 Sarah. 
 She's gone. It's over. 
 [Laughs] 
 Something funny? 
 You've never been in love, have you? 
 Really, truly in love? 
 Why? 
 Because then you'd know... It'll never be over. 
 It is for you. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 [Siren wails] 
 Your friend told me I might find you up this way. 
 I can't let you take him, John. 
 This can't end like New Rochelle. 
 Do I need to look in the trunk? 
 You can do whatever you like. 
 It isn't gonna change what I have to do. 
 Let me have him, John. 
 If I do, he'll get away with it. 
 I'll see that he doesn't. 
 It won't be up to you. 
 That's my point. 
 There are things you can do, detective, and things you can't. 
 And that's where I come in. 
 I can't allow you to just execute people. 
 This isn't on you. 
 It's on me. 
 All I'm asking for is your trust. 
 What? 
 For you to do the right thing? 
 That I'll do what needs to be done. 
 [TV playing indistinct] 
 Sullivan send you? 
 [Mutes TV] 
 This supposed to be some kind of, uh... Intimidation? 
 I don't have his money. 
 You don't have anything I want. 
 Not anymore. 
 Who the hell are you? 
 Good question. 
 Haven't known the answer for a long time. 
 I know who I was. 
 I was the guy who left her behind. 
 You know why? 
 The real reason? 
 Because I thought she deserved someone better than me. 
 I thought she deserved someone who would look after her... 
 Be there for her. 
 I thought she deserved someone like you. 
 So I don't know. 
 I was hoping you could tell me. 
 Tell you what? 
 Who I'm supposed to be now. 
 Now that she's gone. 
 See... when you find that one person who connects you to the world... 
 You become someone different... 
 Someone better. 
 When that person is taken from you... 
 What do you become then? 
 I was beginning to wonder when I was going to hear from you again. 
 I had some business to take care of, out of town. 
 I trust you now fully appreciate why I couldn't tell you about Sarah's case. 
 I hope you now understand why you should have. 
 Did you know? 
 Was she one of those numbers that came up again and again? 
 What I know, Mr. Reese... 
 Is that New Rochelle happened before we started working together. 
 And because of that, there was nothing that either one of us could have done. 
 Forgot to include that in your birthday present.

 Hello. 
 Detective Carter? 
 This is warden Gustavo Pena. 
 I'm calling from Torreon penitentiary. 
 Yes? 
 I have been asked to inform you we have your fugitive in custody. 
 My fugitive? 
 Yes. 
 A Marshal Jennings delivered him to us, along with ten kilos of uncut heroin found in his possession. 
 Uh, this Marshal-- Just so I'm clear-- 
 Was he tall, dark hair, in a suit? 
 That's him. 
 He said you were the original arresting officer and informed me to tell you that we have him in custody. 
 He's going to be here for a long time. 
 Thank you, warden. 
 One other thing. 
 Do you have any other Americans in your prison? 
 One or two. 
 Thanks.
