 You are being watched. 
 The government has a secret system-- 
 A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. 
 I know because I built it. 
 I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything... 
 Violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you, crimes the government considered irrelevant. 
 They wouldn't act, so I decided I would. 
 But I needed a partner-- 
 Someone with the skills to intervene. 
 Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret. 
 You will never find us. 
 But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Let me guess, I have to cancel my dinner plans. 
 Our mutual friend needs help, detective. 
 He's downtown. 
 I'll be there as soon as I get finished here. 
 I hate to be rude, but it's an emergency, detective. 
 We need you now. 
 [Line goes dead] 
 Carter. 
 I need you to come with me now. 
 But I have this thing-- 
 Not anymore, you haven't. 
 It's an article of faith for me that all criminals, however clever, eventually trip themselves up. 
 You want to tell me what this is all about? 
 Man in the suit? 
 We got him. 
 Morning, Finch. 
 Mr. Reese. 
 What have you been doing? 
 Corrupting detective Fusco. 
 Does he really need any help in that regard? 
 I'm encouraging him to show ambition, to climb the HR ladder. 
 Oh. 
 She's lot prettier than Fusco. 
 And much more discreet. 
 Her online profile is carefully managed. 
 Think she's got something to hide? 
 Many things, I would expect. 
 She's a psychologist. 
 From what I can determine, she specializes in the high-end clients, the sort who insist on discretion. 
 While I dig deeper, you get close to her, see if you can work out where the threat is coming from. 
 She could be the threat, Finch. 
 I'm sure you'll work that out too. next. 
 Sorry. 
 Double shot macchiato, please. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Yes, Lionel. 
 I think I'm about to meet a few of the big hitters from HR. 
 I'm thrilled for you. 
 I thought you'd want to be there. 
 We could take these bastards down. 
 All in good time. 
 It's my balls in a vice here, all right? 
 Plus Carter keeps giving me the stink-eye. 
 Now we need to wrap this thing up. 
 And we will, Lionel, when I say so. 
 Meantime, I want you to look into someone else. 
 Caroline Turing. Sending you a photograph. 
 Get back to me when you got something. 
 Do you think I'm not understanding you? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Giving me signals, putting words in my mouth. 
 And I'm concerned about the things I've already confided in you. 
 I thought we agreed no notes. 
 We did. Um... 
 Sorry, old habits. 
 The things I've told you, if anyone else heard them, that could be a big problem, understand? 
 For whom, Hans? 
 You or me? 
 Both of us. 
 You understand me now? 
 Councilman Larsson, detective Romano, Captain Lewis. 
 Isis is Detective Fusco. 
 We hear you got dirty fingers, Fusco. 
 Fingers? I heard he's got his snout buried in the damn trough. 
 City Council and the district attorney no longer tolerate any malfeasance by NYPD officers. 
 What do you got to say for yourself? 
 You know, I-I don't know, uh... 
 [Laughter] 
 Here. No social niceties. 
 What's on the docket? 
 We got a contract. 
 Rich guy with a problem. He needs to go away. 
 Method is up to you. 
 Speed is the only stipulation. 
 You gonna pick the shooter, Simmons? 
 My guys are all solid. 
 Fusco here will run interference with homicide in case there's any questions. 
 If I'm gonna look after somebody, I'm gonna need to know their names. 
 No. You don't. 
 Now the question is do we trust the rich guy? 
 I trust his money. It's already in escrow. 
 Here is a down payment for expenses. 
 I'm sorry, but in order to help you, I have to have your trust. 
 Clearly I don't. 
 I'm referring you to another therapist. 
 You're firing me? 
 No, I-- 
 I'm admitting failure. 
 I'm firing myself. 
 You have issues to resolve, and you need to be able to speak freely. 
 Finch, are you listening to this? 
 It seems some of Ms. Turing's patients are a little... Clingy. 
 I've been open. 
 I laid myself bare to you. 
 I'm helping you, believe me. 
 [Camera clicks] 
 [Phone rings] 
 What now? 
 Yeah, nice to talk to you too. 
 I met them. The HR inner council. 
 So what was it about, handshakes and single malts? 
 No, this was serious. 
 HR is going in the murder-for-hire business. 
 Do you know the target? 
 Yeah, I know the target. You do too. 
 It's that lady shrink you asked me to look into. 
 48 hours and she's dead. 
 Thermostat has a motion detector camera. 
 It'll capture the face of any patient coming or going from Ms. Turing's office. 
 Should be able to identify the more prominent ones in no time. 
 I'm guessing one of them hired HR to keep her quiet. 
 Question is... 
 Which one? Till we figure that out, I'm going to want to stay as close to Turing as possible. 
 I agree. 
 Time for you to work through some of your issues, Mr. Reese. 
 Issues? 
 Tell me, what is it you do, Mr... 
 Rooney. 
 I'm a-- a consultant. It's complicated. 
 Not really important. 
 I'm not so sure. 
 I find business is often personal with my patients. 
 I was told I could count on your discretion. 
 My clients are private people. 
 I respect that, and I will protect it at all cost. 
 Lady after my own heart. 
 So what brings you to seek therapy? 
 You mind closing the blinds? 
 If it makes you more comfortable. 
 Would you care for something to drink? 
 Water would be fine, thank you. 
 [Camera clicks] 
 Looks like her schedule, but with only her clients' initials. 
 The lady is careful. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Detective, any luck with Councilman Larsson's finances? 
 He signed a deposit at his bank this week for $500,000. 
 Nice chunk of change for a public employee. 
 We know where it came from? 
 An escrow account held at that same institution made a disbursement that day in the same amount. 
 Send me the tracking number for the account. 
 I'll take it from here. 
 What is the fine councilman mixed up in here? 
 Murder for hire, Detective. 
 HR is branching out. 
 We'll be in touch. 
 Tell me, what do you see as the goal? 
 Uh, the goal? 
 The purpose for your visit? 
 You seem a little agitated right now. 
 Why would you say that? 
 Body language, closing the blinds. 
 You don't like windows, do you? 
 What is it you're afraid of? 
 That's funny, I was gonna ask you the same thing. 
 Me? 
 You have a panic button installed under your desk. 
 Is that recent? 
 Or someone you're afraid of? 
 You're highly observant, hypervigilant, aware of your surroundings. 
 You're saying I'm paranoid. 
 Is that what you think? 
 I was thinking something else. 
 Former military? 
 Tread carefully, Mr. Reese. 
 Is it that obvious? 
 A little. 
 The way you walk into a room. 
 The way you sit facing the door. 
 You see the world differently than most, don't you? 
 A threat around every corner. 
 Tell me, do you feel the need to protect people? 
 To save them? 
 Choose your words wisely. 
 We can't have anyone discovering what it is we do. 
 [Camera snapping] 
 Mr. Reese, I managed to get a read on that escrow account that's funding HR. 
 Question is who hired them? 
 Impossible to determine. 
 The money comes from dozens of points of payment, multiple countries. 
 The balance on the account is $5,000,000. 
 That's a hell of a payday. 
 Someone with tremendous means wants Caroline Turing gone. 
 I've enlisted the aid of an old friend to help us figure out who. 
 She's cute. 
 Hello, Zoe. 
 Good to hear you're getting some help, but I don't think there's a woman out there alive that could fix you, John. 
 Caroline Turing. You familiar? 
 No, but that's obviously by design. 
 Next to bartenders, men usually like to spill it to female shrinks. 
 It's easier than talking to their wives. 
 These men value discretion. 
 You know any of her patients? 
 A few. 
 Impressive lot. 
 I've narrowed it down to three players. 
 Hans Friedrickson, the lawyer that threatened her. 
 Supposedly he's away on a business trip right now. 
 Or left town to give himself an alibi. 
 Patient number two, banker named Terrance Baxter. 
 Rumor is he's being investigated for Ponzi scheme. 
 And there's David Sarkesian. 
 He's a prominent city official. 
 Whispers are he's sleeping with his intern. 
 Looks like our shrink is sitting on a powder keg of secrets. 
 Which could be lucrative, if you play your cards right. 
 Or deadly if you don't. 
 Target works downtown. 
 Leaves the office late most nights. 
 Same path every night. 
 She walks eight blocks to the Fulton Street subway station. 
 That one block stretch on Pearl Street? 
 That's the dark zone. 
 No storefronts, low foot traffic, no cameras. 
 Once she turns that corner, she steps off the grid. 
 That's your window. Robbery gone bad. 
 Purse to be found in a dumpster in Alphabet City, murder weapon never to be recovered in the East River. 
 Piece of cake. 
 We're on. 
 Heading your way. 
 Hello, doc. 
 John, I-- 
 What are you doing here? 
 It's probably not a good night for a walk. 
 Look, John, this-- 
 This is not okay. 
 Were you following me? 
 How about I call you a cab? 
 This is what I was getting at in today's session. 
 You think there's something lurking around every corner, but there isn't, John. 
 There's no Boogeyman here. 
 You're not overseas anymore. 
 And this is the way I go home every night. 
 My-- my subway stop's right up there. 
 It's-- 
 It's okay. 
 I'm safe. 
 Go home. 
 Try to get some sleep. 
 Okay. 
 I'll see you tomorrow, okay? 
 [Gun cocks] 
 [Gunshots] 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Shots fired, Fulton Street and Pearl. 
 Multiple units responding. 
 Who are those men? Why did they shoot at you? 
 'Cause I was standing in front of you. 
 They want to kill me? 
 Don't. 
 Why? 
 The men who are after us are cops. 
 No way to tell if he's working with them or not. 
 Come on. 
 It's me. Did you take care of the shrink? 
 Not yet. 
 Telling me five of you can't handle one woman? 
 Some guy came out of nowhere fast. 
 He shot Mandel in both legs. 
 Let me guess. Tall guy in a suit. 
 Did the woman get a good look at any of you? 
 Yeah. 
 That's bad news for you, my friend. 
 You don't clean this up, we're not gonna take the risk you'll turn state's. 
 You kill them... 
 Or I'll kill you. 
 What are we doing here? 
 We need a place to hide, to regroup. 
 Hello. A room, please. 
 The only room we have available is the honeymoon suite at $3,000 per night. 
 We'll take it. 
 Too many cops in the neighborhood. 
 We'll need to lay low in the hotel till morning. 
 Working on an escape route for you, Mr. Reese. 
 Appreciate it. 
 In a bit of a tough spot here. 
 Great, now you're hearing voices. 
 Not exactly. He's a friend. 
 A very resourceful friend. 
 
 
 
 [Phone rings] 
 Let me guess, I have to cancel my dinner plans. 
 Our mutual friend needs help, Detective. 
 He's downtown. 
 I'll be there as soon as I get finished here. 
 I hate to be rude, but it's an emergency, Detective. 
 We need you now. 
 [Line goes dead] 
 Carter. 
 I need you to come with me now. 
 But I have this thing-- 
 Not anymore, you haven't. 
 I don't understand. 
 Who would want to kill me? 
 I was hoping you could tell me that. 
 Someone with the means and the money to hire a team to get rid of you. 
 Sound like any of your patients? 
 Yeah. All of them. 
 The only way to call off the dogs is to find out who hired them. 
 I-I can't think. 
 I can't move. 
 This must be what panic feels like. 
 Here, have some chocolate. 
 Will these help to produce an adrenaline response? 
 No, but they taste good. 
 Who the hell are you? 
 Let's just say we both help people cope with their problems. 
 I'm just a little bit more, uh, hands-on. 
 I promise... 
 I will tell you when it's time to panic. 
 Carter, this is Detective Sagan, NYPD. 
 You want to give her a little demonstration of what you do? 
 This footage is from 90 minutes ago. 
 We have reports of shots fired. 
 Then he fled with this young woman. 
 We think she's a hostage. We lost them after that. 
 But we're confident they're still in this six-block radius. 
 Which happens to be the most heavily surveilled six blocks in the world. This is now a federal manhunt. 
 Surprised to see you here, Fusco. 
 You know me. I like to be where the action is. 
 Are you okay? 
 Better. 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 [Tires screech] 
 Need some help, Finch. 
 HR just found us somehow. 
 It's probably two, three minutes before they find our room. 
 So going down probably isn't an option. 
 I'll look into it. 
 Mr. Reese, I think I've found something. 
 Previous occupant of the penthouse recently went to jail for tax evasion, but the IRS hasn't yet seized everything. 
 The point, Harold? 
 I know you're good at stealing cars. 
 How do you feel about helicopters? 
 It's been a while since I've flown. 
 Might be a little rusty. 
 On the bright side, if you don't remember, it'll be a short fall. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Wait, wait, go back. 
 That's them. 
 Notify our men to converge on that hotel. 
 Uh, all due respect, Detective. 
 NYPD's gonna sit this one out. 
 Send in our teams. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Stairs. Now. 
 You saving me, is this making up for someone you didn't save? 
 I thought we were done with therapy. 
 Talking about your issues helps distract me. 
 Who said I had issues? 
 I'll take that as a yes. 
 [Helicopter flying outside] 
 Wait. 
 Sounds like a helicopter. 
 Isn't that what we want? 
 Yeah, but I haven't stolen it yet. 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 Follow me. Change of plans. 
 You said you'd tell me when to panic. 
 I'm guessing now's the moment. 
 Wheeling the hotel security system feeds to you in three, two, one. 
 Sweep every floor. I want him alive. 
 Who was that? 
 FBI. 
 They want to kill me too? 
 Actually, they're after me. 
 What? 
 Finch, need a little help here. 
 Working on it. 
 Mr. Reese, make your way to the freight elevator at the northwest corner of the building. 
 Take it down to parking sublevel four. 
 There's an old service tunnel. 
 It leads out to the old water treatment plant at the seaport. I'll pick you up there. 
 Okay. 
 [Ominous music]

 [Phone beeps] 
 [phone beeps] let's go. 
 [Phone beeps] let's go. 
 My men are closing in, but there's a complication. 
 The feds are here. 
 They're not looking for Turing. 
 They want the shooter. We're gonna take them both out. 
 How the hell are we gonna take them out with the feds on top of us? 
 We got a guy on the inside that's going to feed us their location, take care of the cameras. 
 The feds think he's holding Turing hostage. 
 He's some kind of special forces wacko. 
 He'll do anything to resist capture. 
 Bring the gear? 
 Enough to blow a hole to China. 
 We're gonna corner him and blow the whole floor. 
 Make it look like he did it. 
 Let's go make a mess. 
 Ms. Morgan, any luck finding the person who hired HR to kill Turing? 
 Not yet, but I tracked down Hans Friedrickson's assistant. 
 Turns out he actually was away on a business trip. 
 Then who was the man threatening Turing? 
 About to find out. 
 We need to talk. 
 Sure, we can talk. 
 I traced your cell phone. 
 And here's the thing, Hans. 
 Your cell phone is registered to a low-life named Jimmy White. 
 Short-con operator, had a couple of stints in minimum security. 
 But I got to say, impersonating a prosecutor? 
 That's probably not your best play. 
 It was just a gig. 
 They forced me to pretend I was this Hans guy, threaten some shrink. 
 Who forced you? 
 I don't know. 
 I swear I don't know. It was all over email. 
 They were... 
 Blackmailing me. 
 They knew everything. 
 [Beeping] 
 We made it to the elevator, Finch. 
 Glad to hear it. 
 I'll contact you when I'm in position. 
 Ms. Morgan, are we any closer to identifying who hired HR? 
 No, but something seems really off. 
 Someone paid Hans to become Turing's patient. 
 I'm going back to her office to see if I can dig up anything else. 
 And, Harold, be careful. 
 I'd hate for anything to happen to our mutual friend. 
 Got word they're on the freight elevator. 
 You can cut them off on 25. 
 [Phone beeps] what are we doing? 
 They hit the button on the floor below us. 
 The guys who were trying to kill you or the guys who were trying to kill me? 
 Open the fire safety panel. 
 Try shorting the wires till the override light comes on. 
 Then we can bypass the floor below. 
 They stopped the elevator at 26. 
 Set your charges in the stairwell, and get rid of them. 
 Move. 
 I think I owe you an apology. 
 How do you figure? 
 I diagnosed you as paranoid. 
 Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not trying to kill you. 
 I can't find the right wire. 
 It's not working. 
 Got him. 
 Tell the teams to stage off 27. 
 Enter 26 through stairwell B. 
 Yes, sir. 
 FBI's closing in. 
 Where are we at, guys? 
 We are good to go, boss. 
 All right, you move in on my mark. 
 [Phone beeps] we're out of time. 
 Just stay behind me, and I'll hold them off as long as I can. 
 Do it. 
 Get ready to move. 
 He's armed, but I want him taken alive, if possible. 
 Understood? 
 But I'll give you the signal. 
 On your count, Simmons. 
 Five... 
 In a bit of a bind, Harold. 
 Four... 
 Hope you've got some tricks left up your sleeve. 
 One or two. 
 Three... 
 Two... 
 Move in, team, now. 
 Go. 
 Do you hear me? 
 Simmons? 
 Team, move in. 
 Team, move now, you're gonna lose them. 
 The hell's going on? 
 Uh, sir, comms are down. 
 Which comms? 
 All of them. 
 Line's dead. 
 Got it. 
 What the hell's happening? 
 Uh, every cell tower south of Canal Street just went out. 
 DHS had a failsafe in place to take control of the cell infrastructure in case of an emergency. 
 Someone hacked it. 
 The towers are white-listed. 
 Only authorized numbers can use them. 
 In this case, only one number. 
 Whose number? 
 [Phone dials] 
 I trust you can still hear me, Mr. Reese? 
 I have to say, Harold, we've been working together for some time now, but you continue to surprise me. 
 Likewise, Mr. Reese. 
 You should have something of a competitive advantage now. 
 Just get the team on a hard line now, damn it. 
 Wait, what's this guy doing? 
 All right, we're going down there now. 
 Let's move. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Thanks for the help, Carter. 
 Someone's feeding HR intel about your whereabouts. 
 I'm gonna take care of it though. 
 There are no unis on Peal Street. 
 You can smuggle them out there. 
 What the hell, Carter? 
 Hang up the phone and hand it to me. 
 Come on, come out of there. 
 What's this about? Some type of misunderstanding? 
 No, I understand things perfectly. 
 You're working for HR. 
 Who were you talking to? 
 None of your business. 
 What the hell do you think you're doing? 
 HR. You're guiding them. 
 You're their eyes and ears. 
 Listen, Carter. 
 I'm working undercover in HR, not for them. 
 The feds? IAB? Show me some paperwork, Fusco. 
 It's nothing like that. Nothing official. 
 Listen, I made some mistakes. Some big ones. 
 But things are different now. 
 I'm helping people. You got to trust me. 
 I want answers. Now. 
 The guy in the suit. 
 What did you say? 
 The guy in the suit, the one you've been chasing. 
 Look, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but they seem to know when people are in trouble. 
 And they help them. Him and another guy. 
 And me too sometimes. 
 This other guy. Describe him. 
 He's like a professor. He's got the glasses and a high-dollar vocabulary. 
 That's who I was talking to when you came in. 
 [Phone rings] 
 You got some explaining to do, Finch. 
 Hello, Detectives. 
 I understand you'll have some questions, but we're somewhat short of time. 
 I'm heading downtown to help our friend. 
 I suggest you do the same thing. 
 John will almost certainly need your help. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 If you're not the mole, then who is? 
 I know exactly who the mole is. 
 I know everyone who's in HR. 
 When we get done with this, we're gonna take them all down. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 What now? 
 Old service tunnel down here we can take outside the perimeter. 
 My friend's meeting us there. 
 Hold on a second. 
 Mr. Reese, I'm in position. 
 This comes out to a water treatment plant by the river. 
 Keep going till you find my friend. 
 Split up. 
 I'll hold them off. Go. 
 John, thank you. 
 Turing's on her way to you. 
 [Gunshots] 
 And I think I'm gonna be a little held up. 
 [Gunfire] 
 I'll get Ms. Turing to safety, and I'll come back for you, John. 
 [Gunfire] 
 Harold Finch, I presume. 
 You're a hard man to find, Harold. 
 I don't know who you-- 
 Save it. 
 We met before, remember? 
 Nathan introduced you as his IT guy. 
 He always had a talent for understatement. 
 What do you want from me, Alicia? 
 Nothing complicated. 
 You created God. 
 And now you're gonna help me shut it down. 
 [Gunfire] 
 All right, go, go, go! 
 Looks like you're just about out of time, my friend. 
 Just about. 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Gunfire] 
 Get in! 
 Get to the car! 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Tires screeching] 
 Before Nathan died, before your machine killed him, I could tell something was eating away at him, the ethics of what he was building. 
 I thought he was fighting with himself over it. 
 But he was fighting with you. 
 He knew, didn't he? 
 The hubris of creating something as powerful as the machine. 
 I can feel it right now. 
 Watching us, listening to us. 
 There's no hiding from it. 
 I'm so tired of running. 
 I've made some mistakes. 
 But building the machine is not one of them. 
 You haven't been running from the machine, Alicia, and the machine didn't kill Nathan. 
 You've been running from people. 
 From people that you and I both trusted. 
 You're right. 
 And you're lucky I found you first. 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 Why didn't you tell us we were both working with you? 
 To protect you. 
 Protect us? 
 You almost got me killed. 
 You can't trust us, how are we supposed to trust you? 
 Trust is complicated, Lionel. 
 For example, I'm sitting in a police car with one cop who tried to murder me and another who spent six months trying to lock me up. 
 So you'll forgive me if I take things one step at a time. 
 Slow down, Carter. 
 Slow down? These two know they're going down for life. 
 They'll kill anybody who gets in their way. 
 I got this. 
 Trust me. 
 Well, we should all grab a drink together sometime. 
 My treat. 
 Do you have any idea what the wrong person would do to you if they knew you had access? 
 What kind of chaos that could create? 
 Define "wrong person." 
 You were willing to pay corrupt police officers to target an innocent woman just to draw me out. 
 What are you talking about? 
 The machine, you know how it works. 
 The irrelevant list. 
 You knew it would send us Turing's name if you put her in danger. 
 Irrelevant list? 
 I didn't need to lure you out. 
 I've been following you for weeks. 
 [Gunshot] 
 I thought she'd never shut up. 
 So nice to finally meet you, Harold. 
 You can call me Root. 
 [Phone rings] 
 You were set up, John. 
 Turing isn't who we think she is. 
 What do you mean? 
 Her office, her life, it's all a mirage. 
 I saw the escrow transfer. 
 She was the one who paid HR. 
 She put the hit on herself. 
 Turing must've learned how you operate, that you'd show up if her life was in danger. 
 She was trying to lure you out into the open. 
 She wasn't looking for me. 
 She was looking for him. 
 You hired HR yourself. 
 You were willing to risk your own life to find me? 
 I did this corporate training thing once. 
 I was blackmailing the CEO, long story, but they did this exercise called the trust fall, where you close your eyes and fall... 
 And wait for someone to catch you. 
 I knew you boys wouldn't let me down. 
 Come on, Harold. 
 We've got so much to talk about.
