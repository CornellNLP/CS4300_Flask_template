 Previously on "The 100"... 
 Where's Finn? 
 Looking for you. 
 I count 26. 
 These people don't look like warriors. 
 What have you done with them? 
 Your friends were not here. 
 (Gunfire) 
 Man : You need to go. 
 You sent an assassin into one of my villages. 
 Later we will talk. In the meantime, your friend will be used to send a message. 
 Uhh! 
 Leave or die. 
 Mark this one for the Cerberus program. 
 First dose is the worst. 
 It's Lincoln... he's a Reaper. 
 (Groaning) 
 Now what? 
 Now we take him home. 
 There's a containment breach. 
 Even a little radiation could kill them. 
 Tsing : If we were to circulate Maya's blood through your system... 
 I could make her better. 
 They exposed her to radiation on purpose. 
 The standard treatment sucks. 
 Jasper : Are those all Grounders? 
 I won't leave the others behind. 
 What choice do we have? 
 I volunteer. 
 I'm impressed, Jasper, and deeply grateful. 
 You saved us, right? 
 It's the least we could do. 
 Uhh. 
 (Gasping) 
 Help me. Open the door! 
 4 minutes and 10 seconds. 
 We're making progress. 
 Keenan : Please. It hurts. 
 She's in pain. I'm bringing her in. 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 Do you trust her not to talk? 
 (Keenan screaming) 
 Might as well get a full reading. 
 (Keenan screaming) 
 "The blood of the forty-seven could be our permanent solution." 
 That's what you said. 
 Science takes time, Cage. 
 There are dead ends and blind alleys on the path to every breakthrough. 
 You call that a blind alley? 
 She's one of us. 
 No. Of course not. 
 I call that sacrifice. For the greater good. 
 Keenan : Open the door! 
 (Screaming) 
 (Screaming) 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Man : Civilian check-in will take place at 0900 hours. 
 All civilians must be accounted for by your station supervisor. 
 There has to be another way. 
 There's not. 
 Commander's message was clear. 
 Leave or die. 
 We have 16 hours. 
 You think we should just give up? 
 This is not our home. 
 It's theirs. 
 Because Kane went looking for peace, he has given us a chance to move on without bloodshed. 
 And where's Marcus now? 
 In prison still? 
 You're just gonna leave him there? 
 Like the kids in Mount Weather. 
 If we run, who's gonna rescue them? 
 You weren't there, Abby. I saw them. 
 Warriors trained since childhood to fight and die for their cause. 
 And as we speak, they are marching on this camp. 
 And trust me when I tell you the right choice is to live so that we can come back and fight another day. 
 (Metal clanking) 
 Ma'am, Sir. 
 The people are on edge. 
 A word from their chancellor could go a long way. 
 Of course. 
 Byrne : Unfortunately, sir, Dr. Griffin is still in command. 
 Until a vote can be taken, or you willingly transfer your authority. 
 What are you waiting for? 
 I'm not ready to march our people into the desert, Thelonious. 
 Not until we try to find another way. 
 We'll talk to them together. 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 (Chatter stops) 
 Chancellor? 
 Listen up. 
 By now you've all heard the rumor,  and unfortunately, it's true. 
 (Crowd murmuring)  The Grounders are coming. 
 We have a difficult decision to make. 
 Thankfully, Chancellor Jaha has found his way back to us, and we're discussing all options. 
 But to be safe... 
 You need to pack. Now. 
 Whatever you can carry. 
 We may need to leave at a moment's notice. 
 Where will we go? 
 I don't know, is the answer. 
 But I heard of a place. 
 A City of Light. 
 It's across the dead zone. 
 Man : What makes you think we'll make it there? 
 Because we made it here. 
 I have faith, and right now, given the alternative, that's good enough for me. 
 Not for us. 
 If we leave here, what happens to our people in Mount Weather? 
 As your mother said... that is a very difficult decision to make. 
 But the time has come for each and every one of us to ask: Is this how the story of our people ends? 
 Did we come all this way just to die tomorrow? 
 Because if we're not gone by the time that sun rises, that is exactly what will happen. 
 (Crowd murmuring) 
 No decision's been made. 
 In the meantime, please report to your station supervisor and gather emergency supplies. 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Hey, where have you been? 
 In the dropship. 
 You need to come back with me right now. 
 Why? What's happened? 
 I'll explain on the way. 
 Bring a med kit. 
 Meet me at Raven's gate. 
 This is my fault. 
 The Grounders are attacking because of me. 
 The Grounders are attacking because that's what they do. 
 Go with Bellamy. 
 Your mom said no decision has been made. 
 If that changes, I'll let you know. 
 (Growling) 
 It's ok. It's ok. 
 He's been restrained. 
 (Growling) 
 I can't believe we're back here again. 
 Can you help him? 
 (Growling) 
 I don't know. 
 (Growling) 
 I knew Mount Weather controlled the Reapers. 
 (Growling) 
 I had no idea they were creating them. 
 (Snarling) 
 If they can do that to Lincoln... 
 What are they doing to our friends? 
 (Metal clanking) 
 (Growling) 
 (Music playing) 
 Harper : I'm tired of puking. 
 Miller : I'm tired of being a human pincushion. 
 Look, I know this sucks, but as long as it seems like we're cooperating, we're buying ourselves time. 
 Time for what? 
 I say if we're gonna die in here, we might as well die trying to escape. 
 We've been over this. After Clarke left, there is no escape. 
 We just have... to hold on long enough for her to find a way to get us out. 
 What if she doesn't find a way? 
 What if she didn't make it out? 
 What if that's just a story they're telling us to hide the fact that they killed her? 
 Then no one's coming for us and we're doing exactly what they want us to do. 
 Jasper... you know you've thought it, too. 
 All right, then. We escape. 
 No. 
 We find the truth. 
 How do we do that? 
 We're criminals, right? 
 So, let's be criminals. 
 (Screaming) 
 He's convulsing. 
 So, what does it mean? 
 What happened to his leg? 
 I shot him. 
 Clarke, he's lost a lot of blood. 
 (Lincoln growling) 
 Can you shine the light on his neck? 
 Needle marks. 
 You think he's been drugged? 
 Clarke : Maybe. 
 Lincoln! 
 (Lincoln growling) 
 David : Is it true? We're evacuating? 
 I just gave the order. 
 My son is still inside that mountain. 
 David, I know, and believe me, if there was any other way, I would've taken it. 
 But I swear to you, as soon as we find someplace safe, we'll figure out a way to get them. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 Yes, you are. 
 The guard is leading the evacuation. 
 If you stay, you'll be disobeying orders. 
 Then order me to stay. 
 The other parents with missing kids aren't going anywhere, either. 
 I can protect them. 
 I'd be ordering you to die. 
 How is that gonna help your son? 
 Abby, please. 
 You got your job back. 
 Don't make me abandon mine. 
 Sergeant, pack your things. 
 Report to Major Byrne. 
 The Grounders attack at dawn. 
 I want every man, woman, and child out of this camp by then. 
 Is that clear? 
 Is that clear? 
 Tsing : Based on these results, treatments with the blood of the forty-seven will never be enough to get us to the surface. 
 Cage : Why are you saying that like it's good news? 
 Because it's made me start over. 
 If treatments using their blood give us temporary immunity, how do we extend that immunity forever? 
 By going to the source of their blood. 
 Bone marrow. 
 What would happen to the donors? 
 There's 382 of us. That's roughly 8 procedures for each of the kids. 
 You didn't answer my question. 
 Everyone of the forty-seven would die. 
 He'll never go for that. 
 You have to convince him. 
 Cage... we could be living on the ground within a month. 
 All of us. 
 If your theory is correct. 
 I'll worry about the science. 
 You worry about your father. 
 We have to stop the bleeding and get the bullet out. 
 Hold his leg down. 
 (Lincoln groaning) 
 Shh, shh. 
 Rawr! Aah! 
 (Growling) 
 I'll get some more. 
 (Groaning) 
 O. Once the drug is out of his system, he'll be ok. 
 You can't protect me from this one, big brother. 
 (Lincoln screaming in distance) 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 (Muffled scream) 
 Nyko. What are you doing here? 
 Our scouts have already arrived. 
 The commander is true to her word. 
 If you do not leave, you will die. 
 Octavia, you saved my life from the Reapers. 
 Now let me save yours. 
 It's what Lincoln would have wanted. 
 (Lincoln screaming in distance) 
 What was that? 
 That was Lincoln. 
 Your mom would be proud. 
 My mom would know how to save him. 
 Bellamy, don't. 
 He's Lincoln's friend and their healer. 
 (Grunting) 
 Clarke : He's seizing again. 
 What is that? 
 Wait! 
 Back off. Right now. 
 Yu gonplei ste odon. 
 It's what they say before death. 
 He's not trying to heal him. 
 He's trying to kill him. 
 Nyko? Is it true? 
 Yes. Death is the only way. 
 Hold on. There could be a way to bring him back. 
 None that I've ever seen. 
 We have to go. The camp's leaving. 
 Yu! 
 We have to stop... 
 Get off him! 
 You slaughtered my people. 
 Elders. Children. Innocents. 
 
 
 
 Octavia : Nyko, you're killing him. 
 Nyko : Blood must have blood! 
 Get out of the way! 
 Bellamy, you're not shooting him! No! 
 Aah! 
 (Electricity crackling) 
 Lincoln. 
 He's not breathing. 
 Clarke : His heart's stopped. Move. 
 (Inhales) 
 He was dead. 
 How did you do that? 
 You've tried bringing Reapers back before? 
 And they died like this? 
 What is it? 
 I know how to stop the attack. 
 (Metal clanking) 
 Clarke : He's stable for now. We should go. 
 You ready? 
 Even if you can save Lincoln... he won't be the same. 
 The things he's done... they'll stay with him. 
 We don't know that. 
 Yes, we do. 
 Lincoln's savable... and so are you. 
 Now, come on. We have to hurry. 
 Today, Monty. 
 I'm going as fast as I can. 
 Relax. Maya's decontaminating the surveillance room. 
 No one's watching. 
 We got this. 
 If we can get that door open. 
 (Beep) 
 Ye of little faith. 
 That's my boy. Come on, let's move. 
 Go, go, go, go, go. 
 Harper, watch the hall. 
 Why do I have to watch the hall? 
 Monty's good with computers. Miller's a thief. 
 Why can't you watch the hall? 
 I'm the mastermind. 
 Just go watch the hall. Come on. 
 What do we have here? 
 It's password protected. 
 We'll see about that. 
 And they said we wouldn't amount to anything. 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Man on P.A. : Initiated evacuation plan 2A. 
 Report to your station supervisor for further instruction. You made the right decision, Abby. Mom. Where have you been? We're leaving. I know how to stop the attack. What are you talking about? We haven't been able to negotiate with the Grounders because we haven't had anything to offer them. The biggest threat they face is from the Reapers. I think we may be able to eliminate that threat for them once and for all. How? Abby. You can't serious... (indistinct chatter) They're here. Man on P.A. : Initiated evacuation plan 2A. Report to your station supervisor for further instructions. Clarke : They're not attacking yet, which means we still have time. Abby : We have two hours till dawn. Let me talk to the commander. She was Anya's second. Maybe she'll listen. We don't even know if the commander's here. Yes, we do. Nyko told us. You have to at least let her try. Abby, we're wasting time. Give me the authority now. Hold on. Clarke, you said that Lincoln is going through withdrawal. We don't even know what he's withdrawing from. The detox alone could kill him. That's where you come in. And if I can't save him? That's not an option. We are risking everything on a bluff, Abby. We have an out. We have a way to save the lives of our people. Not all of them. We will come back to save the kids inside Mount Weather. We all know that's not gonna happen. Abby, this has gone on long enough. If you do not give the order to begin the Exodus, you are killing us all. I'm sorry. I can't give that order. Abby... give the order. No. I... am the elected chancellor of the Ark. And I am not gonna let you risk the lives of my people. Do you understand? I'm going to ask you once again... give the order to begin the Exodus. No. Are you through yet? Jaha : Sergeant Miller? Major Byrne. I am relieving Dr. Griffin of her command. Place these three into custody but make sure that they are ready to leave with the rest of us within the hour. Right now! Major, or the blood of everyone in this camp will be on your hands, too. Abby : Major Byrne, Sergeant Miller, put Chancellor Jaha in the stockade. Yes, Ma'am. Everything we did to survive... you're just throwing it all away. Why? Because I have faith, too. In my daughter. (Metal clanking) Thank you. I'll send a guard detail with you. No. They'll see it as a threat. I have to do this on my own. Finn will take you to Lincoln. If you're wrong... all of us are gonna die. Yes. (Gasps) Guys. Ha! Wow. (Keys clacking on keyboard) Hey, I got something. Me, too. Damn, I'm good. They're alive. If you so much as look at her the wrong way, I will slit your throat. You're the one who burned 300 of my warriors alive. You're the one who sent them there to kill us. Do you have an answer for me, Clarke of the sky people? I've come to make you an offer. This is not a negotiation. I can help you beat the Mountain Men. Go on. Hundreds of your people are trapped inside Mount Weather. Kept in cages. Their blood is used as medicine. How do you know this? Because I saw them. My people are prisoners there, too. I was one of them. Lies. No one escapes the mountain. I did. With Anya. We fought our way out together. Another lie. Anya died in the fire. You killed her. She told me you were her second. I'm sure she'd want you to have this. We don't know it's hers. Lexa : Anya was my mentor, before I was called to lead my people. Did she die well? Yes. By my side, trying to get a message to you. What message? The only way to save both our people is if we join together. Those who are about to die will say anything. I'm still waiting for an offer, Clarke. The Mountain Men are turning your people into Reapers. I can turn them back. Impossible. I've done it. With Lincoln. That traitor is the reason Inda! My village was slaughtered by your people. You say you can turn Reapers back into men? Yes. Then prove it. Show me Lincoln. (Door creaks) What are we doing out here? I told you to trust me. Son. (Exhales) It worked. It's ok. You got the same treatment I did. Go ahead. I'd forgotten the smells. This is where we belong. (Inhales) You always told me that the surface was our true home. Not some concrete coffin. We have to go back now. We only have a few minutes. Come on. Dad? Don't play with me, son. What will it take to stay? Bone marrow. All that they have. They'll die so that we can finally live. (Inhales) (Exhales) This is our world. We deserve this. We are the keepers of history. What we've done to the outsiders has corrupted our legacy. I can't go down that road any further. Dad. Dad. Please. The answer is no. (Thunder) (Metal clanking) Oh, thank God. Where's Clarke? Trying to stop a war. Pupils are unresponsive. Tie off his arm. Tight as you can. Thanks to the supplies your brother found, Lincoln might have a chance. What's that? This will bring down his fever. Abby : Hold him down! (Grunting) (Lincoln groaning) Clarke : What's happening? Why isn't it working? Abby : His heart stopped. You're their healer? Tilt his head back. Pull his chin down to open his airway. (Whispering)  Come on. This way. (Whispering)  Come on. You're stopping. What's wrong? I'm sorry. He's gone. No, it's not possible. You're wrong! Octavia. (Octavia crying) Octavia : Come back. Octavia : Lincoln. I'll kill them all. Please. You don't have to do this. You lied. And you're out of time. (Electricity humming) Hit him again. (Electricity humming) (Gasping) Oh, Lincoln. (Whispering)  Octavia. If Alpha's on the ground, maybe other stations are, too. You're from Alpha, right? My dad was chief guard. He sure loved having a thief for a kid. Hey. You're a great thief. These are the engineering schematics for this whole place. If there's a way out, we're gonna find it. Guys. Harper didn't show for breakfast. You guys seen her? Not since Dante's office. So, where the hell is she? (Whimpering)  Please. No. Please. Please. Don't worry. This won't hurt. The hip has the largest marrow pocket. We'll begin the aspiration there. I don't need to know the details. Just do it. (Whimpering, gasping) Your father will come around, Cage. What if he doesn't? I just want to go home. Cage : I know. So do we. (Whimpering)  I just want to go...  (Screaming) Lincoln's recovery was... Impressive. No one's ever survived such a fate before. It's not complicated, really. We just have to keep them alive long enough for the drug to leave their system. I know we can do the same for others. You may have your truce. Thank you. I just need one thing in return. Tell me. Deliver me the one you call Finn. Our truce begins... with his death.
