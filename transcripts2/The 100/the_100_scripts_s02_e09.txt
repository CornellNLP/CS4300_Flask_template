 Previously on "The 100"... 
 Hundreds of your people are trapped inside Mount Weather. 
 Their blood is used as medicine. 
 My people are prisoners there, too. 
 Why are you showing us this? 
 Because I'm afraid. 
 Of what? 
 That you're next. 
 Harper didn't show up for breakfast. 
 You guys seen her? 
 The only way to save both our people is if we join together. 
 I'm in love with you. 
 Everything I've done, all that matters is that you're ok. 
 Deliver me the one you call Finn. 
 Our truce begins with his death. 
 No. Finn! 
 What will they do to him? 
 Lincoln : Finn took 18 lives. 
 He will suffer the pain of 18 deaths. 
 I love you, too. 
 You're gonna be ok. 
 Thanks, Princess. 
 No! 
 (Panting) 
 (Sniffles) 
 (Sobbing) 
 (Sobbing continues) 
 Let me. 
 They would've tortured him. 
 I had to. I... 
 It's ok. It's ok. 
 I had to. It's ok. 
 What did I do? 
 (Sobbing) 
 Gustus : The commander is ready to talk. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Blood has answered blood. 
 Some on my side say that's not enough. 
 They wanted the murderer to suffer as our tradition demands, but they do not know that your suffering will be worse. 
 What you did tonight will haunt you until the end of your days. 
 Still, there will be restitution. 
 The body will be given to the people of Tondc, murderer and murder joined by fire. 
 Only then can we have peace. 
 Kane : No. No. We've done enough. 
 The boy should be buried by his own people. 
 Enough? We were owed the pain of 18 deaths. 
 We were owed our righteous kill. 
 My village deserves justice. 
 You don't want justice. You want vengeance. 
 You have not seen my vengeance. 
 We'll do it... 
 But when it's over, we talk about how to get our people out of Mount Weather, all of our people. 
 We want the same things, Clarke. 
 Good. When do we leave? 
 Now. 
 Choose your attendants. 
 Clarke, you don't have to do this. 
 Yes, I do. 
 If this truce doesn't hold, I killed Finn for nothing. 
 Clarke is right. We need to do this. 
 Peace with the Grounders is the only way we'll survive. 
 Oh, I don't think they know what peace is. 
 The commander does. 
 She's a child. 
 They're being led by a child. 
 So are we. 
 Go away. 
 Raven, I'm sorry. 
 I said, go away! 
 I know how hard this must be for you, but I'm leaving with the Grounders, and I need you to keep working on the radio. 
 What are you doing? What are you doing? 
 They need to take him now. 
 Like hell, they do, get off. 
 Give us a minute, please. Raven... 
 You agreed to this? 
 We're taking him back to the village where the massacre took place. 
 There's a death ritual. 
 It's the only way to get our people out of Mount Weather. 
 Then I'm coming, too, and... don't worry... 
 I'll bring your damn radio. 
 Oh... 
 Oh... 
 (Music playing on radio) 
 (Music volume increases) 
 Anything? 
 Keep looking. 
 Whatever happened to Harper, someone must have seen something. 
 How many places could she be? 
 We're in a sealed bunker. 
 Jasper : There has to be rooms we don't know about, places that aren't mapped. 
 Miller : Well? Is it possible? 
 I doubt it, but maybe. 
 Thanks. You are just a big help. 
 Jasper : Easy, Miller. Maya is on our side. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 Yes. I'm sure. She's risking more than any of us. 
 Really? Is she's gonna end up in the kennel, too, if she gets caught? 
 Monty : Stop it. I found something. 
 That leads to an antenna on the ground, ok? 
 If we can access the radio, we can send a message over the Arkwide channel, tell them we're here. 
 Maya : The only radio is in the command center on level 7, highly restricted. 
 You got in before. 
 Only because it was scheduled for decontamination. 
 That won't work again so soon. 
 We don't need the radio. 
 We need the wires that run into it. Here. 
 The art warehouse. That I can get us into. 
 Good. Now all we have to do is break through a two-foot section of wall, find the outgoing wire, and jack it to a closed system without being heard by anyone in the command center or in the field. 
 That's all, huh? 
 No. 
 We'll also need to steal some copper wire, the guard schedules, and a walkie-talkie... 
 Oh, yeah... and a big-ass hammer. 
 (Horse neighs) 
 Hey, you doing all right? 
 Yeah. 
 You did the right thing. 
 Now I get to live with it. 
 You still think this truce is a bad idea, don't you? 
 I think we're wasting time with politics while our friends are in trouble. 
 We need their army to get to Mount Weather, Bellamy, and you know it. 
 Their army has been getting their ass kicked by Mount Weather forever. 
 What we need is an inside man, someone to be our eyes and ears. 
 Forget it. It's too dangerous. 
 Clarke, if you can make it out, I can make it in. 
 I said no. 
 Since I don't take orders from you, I'm gonna need a better reason. 
 I can't lose you, too, ok? 
 Cage : Brief me. 
 Yes, sir. 
 The commander's force never attacked the Ark. 
 Instead, at 0600 this morning, they withdrew into these woods here. 
 Outsiders never withdraw, Lieutenant. 
 No, sir, but under this commander, they do make alliances. 
 Is that what happened here? 
 It's unclear, sir, but it's a possibility we need to consider. 
 Sir, if this is an alliance between the outsiders and the Ark, there are things we can do to break it. 
 We let them kill each other so they don't come here to take their people back. 
 I don't care how many men they have. 
 They will not get past our defenses. 
 Sir, we shouldn't take this threat lightly. 
 We're not, Lieutenant. 
 You have my word on that. 
 Nothing is gonna stop us from getting to the ground. 
 Clarke, it's safer on our side. 
 We need to trust them, Bellamy. 
 Clarke : There are no more sides. 
 Hey... 
 We need to talk about Jaha. 
 I can't keep him locked up forever. 
 Maybe I should shocklash him. 
 I was gonna suggest a pardon. 
 Hmm. 
 Clarke is a survivor. 
 She'll get through this, too. 
 Natrona. 
 "Natrona"? 
 Traitor. 
 My people fear me. 
 They think the Reaper is still inside. 
 You can talk to me about what happened. 
 I can't. 
 You're not that monster. 
 I hope you're right. 
 (Gasps) 
 (Gate rumbling) 
 Weapons. 
 We need to disarm before we enter. 
 (Shouting continues) 
 Uh! 
 Commander, stop him. 
 Please. They'll blame us for this, too. 
 Uh! 
 (Coughing) 
 The Sky People march with us now. 
 Anyone who tries to stop that will pay with their life. 
 Warm welcome. 
 Right here. 
 The communication lines are behind this wall. 
 Heh heh. 
 Big-ass enough for you? 
 Wait. They'll hear you. 
 This was the plan. I knew it. 
 She's afraid of losing her blood supply. 
 Look. You don't have to like me, Miller, and you can blame me all you want for what my people are doing, but I'm trying to make things right. 
 Then get the hell out of my way. 
 5 seconds. 
 What happens in 5 seconds? 
 Miller realizes what a dick he is? 
 (Alarm blaring) 
 Friend owed me a favor. 
 Time it to the blasts. 
 Jackpot. 
 "People of Tondc, in fire, we cleanse the pain of the past." 
 Clarke... 
 (Murmuring) 
 I've set it up to play our SOS on a loop over the Arkwide channel. 
 If I can get it to transmit, somebody is bound to hear it. 
 (Oscillating signal) 
 Oh, that don't sound good. 
 I've heard this on the black box of the Exodus ship right before it crashed. 
 They crashed the Exodus ship. 
 Jamming signal. 
 What are they jamming now? 
 Everything, probably to keep our people from talking to each other. 
 Are we totally screwed? 
 I wouldn't say totally. 
 I lost someone special to me, too. 
 Her name was Costia. 
 She was captured by the ice nation, whose queen believed she knew my secrets. 
 Because she was mine... they tortured her, killed her, cut off her head. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I thought I'd never get over the pain, but I did. 
 How? 
 By recognizing it for what it is... weakness. 
 What is? Love? 
 So you just stopped caring about everyone? 
 I could never do that. 
 Then you put the people you care about in danger, and the pain will never go away. 
 The dead are gone, Clarke. 
 The living are hungry. 
 Please accept this gift, Commander. 
 We drink this at special occasions. 
 I believe this qualifies. 
 Thank you, Marcus of the Sky People. 
 You're welcome, Lexa. 
 Kom trikru. 
 Just don't drink too much of it. 
 Clarke, let us drink together. 
 It would be my pleasure. 
 Gustus : And allow me. 
 Tonight we celebrate our newfound peace. 
 Tomorrow we plan our war. 
 To those we've lost and to those we shall soon find. 
 Uh! 
 (Coughing) 
 It's poison! 
 It was the Sky People. 
 Yaagh! 
 This wasn't us. 
 You have to know this wasn't us. 
 No. 
 No. No. We didn't do this. 
 Gustus warned me about you, but I didn't listen. 
 Lexa, please... 
 Tell me something, Clarke. 
 When you plunged the knife into the heart of the boy you loved, did you not wish that it was mine? 
 That's not mine. 
 I'm telling you, that's not mine. 
 He put it there when he searched me. 
 No Sky person leaves this room. 
 Do something. 
 Indra... 
 
 
 
 (Oscillating signal) 
 Damn it. 
 So now we're totally screwed? 
 Our message is broadcasting, but it's over a jammed frequency. 
 So then unjam it. 
 What do you think I've been trying to do? 
 Looks like the only way to shut it down is from the source. 
 I need 5 minutes in the command center. 
 No way. You heard Maya. It's too dangerous. 
 Maya : The guard is coming. 
 We're gonna have to go. Cover the hole. 
 Right. No. Leave it. 
 Right. 
 Ok. 
 Jasper : All right. Quick. 
 He's too close. What are we gonna do? 
 I got an idea. 
 What? 
 This. 
 Out now. 
 Don't let me catch you kids in here again. 
 Sorry. 
 Raven... 
 I need to know the truth. 
 I'd step back if I was you. 
 You wanted me to kill Lexa yesterday. 
 If you tried to poison her, I need to know. 
 You're the only murderer here. 
 Leave me alone. 
 You gave me no choice. 
 Why did you turn yourself in? 
 Baby, you ok? 
 Listen to me, Clarke. 
 I know how you feel, like the pain will never go away, but Lexa is wrong. 
 You won't be haunted by this forever. 
 The pain will fade. 
 What got me through was loving you. 
 What is it? 
 You're talking about dad? 
 What I did to Finn was nothing like what you did to him. 
 Don't do this now, Clarke. 
 I was protecting everyone. 
 I didn't have a choice. 
 You did. 
 No. 
 You turned him in. 
 No. I trusted Thelonious to talk to your father and convince him not to go public. 
 You knew dad would never stop. 
 You knew what would happen to him. 
 I was protecting everyone, too. 
 I was protecting you. 
 Clarke, please. 
 We are the same. 
 (Music playing on radio) 
 (Music volume increases) 
 They find the radio? 
 No. Where's Monty? 
 Thought he was with you. 
 Maya : I haven't seen him. 
 (Knocks on door) 
 Again? We were hosed down yesterday. 
 Routine follow-up. Shouldn't take long. 
 (Door closes) 
 Raven : We have to get out of here. 
 We have to get out of here. 
 Tearing each other and yourself apart isn't a way to get through this. 
 Lexa needs this alliance just as much as we do. 
 She's shown herself to be flexible. 
 She listens to you. 
 She thinks we tried to kill her. 
 But we know we didn't. 
 So let's figure out who did. 
 Who would want her dead? 
 Lincoln : Too many to count. 
 Forming an alliance with you was a risk, especially after what Finn did to this village. 
 Octavia : So it had to be someone trying to break the alliance. 
 (Door opens) 
 How's Gustus? 
 Gustus will live. 
 Kane : Wait. Wait. What are you doing? 
 Bellamy : She didn't poison anyone. 
 Indra : I argued for all of you to die, but the commander is merciful. 
 She wants only one. 
 She's innocent. 
 I don't care. 
 They move, they bleed. 
 Hey, hey, stop. Let her go. 
 The rest of you are free. 
 When she's dead, so is the alliance. 
 You should run. 
 I take no joy in this, Raven. 
 But this time, justice will be done. 
 I didn't do it. How is that justice? 
 We have to do something. 
 Wait. We can't. 
 Octavia : Lincoln, talk to them. 
 Aah! 
 (Whimpering) 
 Aah! 
 Lincoln, talk to them. These are your people. 
 Not anymore. 
 You're not longer safe here, my friend. 
 I'll do my best to make sure you get away. 
 Then you'll be on your own. 
 (Raven screaming) 
 Abby : Clarke, we need to move now. 
 I can't save anyone. 
 (Raven screaming) 
 Say something. 
 (Screaming continues) 
 Abby : Clarke, now. 
 (Screaming continues) 
 It wasn't in the bottle. 
 (Screaming continues) 
 Bellamy : Clarke, stop. What are you doing? 
 You'll get yourself killed. 
 I need that bottle now. 
 (Screaming continues) 
 Stop. 
 Let her pass! 
 One of your people tried to kill you, Lexa, not one of mine. 
 You should've run. 
 I can prove it. 
 Explain. 
 The poison wasn't in the bottle. 
 It was in the cup. 
 It was you. 
 He tested the cup. He searched Raven. 
 Gustus would never harm me. 
 You weren't the target. 
 The alliance was. 
 Clarke : We didn't do this, and you know it. 
 This alliance would cost you your life, Heda. 
 (Murmuring) 
 I could not let that happen. 
 This treachery will cost you yours. 
 Uhh... 
 (Beeping) 
 Come on. 
 Alpha Station, you better be listening. 
 Ok. Here we go. 
 Jamming signal deactivated. 
 Jasper, on radio : We don't know how much time we have left. 
 Please hurry. This is Jasper Jordan. 
 We need help. 47 of us are trapped... 
 Yes! 
 Yes! Yes... 
 Jasper, on radio : We don't know how much time we have left. 
 Please hurry. 
 This is Jasper Jordan. We need help. 
 You sure they went together to that village? 
 Sure as we can be. 
 Sir, I told you we need more boots on the ground. 
 Sergeant... 
 Why aren't you at your post? 
 Sir. Routine decon, sir. 
 All clear, gentlemen. 
 (Door closes) 
 Hold up. 
 You forgot to log in. 
 Whoops. I'm always doing that. 
 Oh. 
 Thanks for saving me. Take care. 
 You said it was all clear. 
 Your entry says something else. 
 You sure? Huh. That's weird. 
 If you don't mind, I'll fix it later. 
 I have another room to check. 
 Oh! 
 (Labored breathing) 
 Ugh... 
 Uh! 
 This would've been Finn. 
 (Slice) 
 Rrgh! 
 Ugh... 
 We're not so different, are we? 
 How did you know it was Gustus? 
 He'd do anything for her to protect her. 
 Just makes sense. 
 Look at the thanks he got. 
 Guys... 
 What is it? 
 Raven : Listen to this. 
 Jasper, on radio : 47 of us are trapped inside Mount Weather. 
 Talk to him. Say something. 
 It's repeating. 
 Octavia : They're alive. 
 We need to do this now. 
 You've got the alliance. Now is the time to use it. 
 First, we need an inside man. 
 You were right. 
 Without someone on the inside to lower their defenses, turn off the acid fog, an army is useless. 
 You should go. 
 I thought you hated that plan, that I would get myself killed. 
 I was being weak. It's worth the risk. 
 My map of Mount Weather. 
 Find a way to get on that radio and talk to us. 
 Good luck. 
 Octavia : Bell, how are you gonna... 
 I can get you through the tunnels. 
 Octavia : He can't go back there, not yet. 
 Let me show you what to look for. 
 Look. I have to. 
 I need to face what I've done. 
 Then let's face it together. 
 No. You're needed here. You know our ways. 
 Without that, this alliance will fail. 
 I won't let that happen. 
 I know you won't. 
 Love is weakness. 
 Abby : Clarke... 
 This is for you. 
 They're ashes from the fire. 
 I thought you could scatter them somewhere, might help you say good-bye. 
 I already said good-bye. 
 (Wincing) 
 Uh! 
 (Crying) 
 Harper. 
 Hey, Harper, what did they do to you? 
 47. 
 They built one for each of us. 
 (Sobs)
