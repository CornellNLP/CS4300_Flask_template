 Previously on "The 100"... 
 Clarke : Bellamy, don't do this. 
 Don't do this. 
 No! 
 He deserves to die. 
 No. 
 We don't decide who lives and dies. 
 Sinclair : The Exodus ship is still tied in to all our major systems. 
 If it launches, the Ark will be crippled, and everyone left on board will die. 
 Launch! 
 Aargh! 
 Anya : You started a war that you don't know how to end. 
 You have no idea what your people have done. 
 We had to stop the attack. 
 You stopped nothing. 
 Clarke, come on. 
 Hraagh! 
 Uh! 
 Clarke... 
 Uh! 
 Anya : Take him away and kill him. 
 No. No. No! No! 
 Jaha : Every simulation has been run. 
 Every system modification has been made. 
 The hard and simple fact is that in 51 hours, life on the Ark will no longer be possible. 
 I choose to find consolation in one remarkable truth. 
 The surviving members of the 100 have proven themselves to be more resilient than we could've ever imagined. 
 Our legacy will go on, and for that... 
 I am not only grateful... but I am proud. 
 Woman : So what do we tell our constituents to do now? 
 What do we do now? 
 Look inside. 
 Find your peace. 
 In the meantime, I'm releasing all available resources to the surviving citizens of the Ark. 
 There will be no more rationing. 
 What we have belongs to all of us. 
 Are you all right, Abby? 
 Yes. 
 I have a patient. 
 She was hurt in the bomb blast. I need to go. 
 Kane : Sir, is it wise to waste rations when we don't know for sure? 
 But we do know for sure. 
 Well, I can't just do nothing. 
 I have to find a solution. 
 Hey, I know this is hard to accept, but if you'd like to spend your remaining time rerunning simulations, by all means, you can do that. 
 I, however, will be spending my time with family and a bottle of 97-year-old scotch. 
 (Overlapping chatter) 
 Bellamy : Come on. These foxholes aren't gonna build themselves. 
 Better hope those landmines work. 
 All the gunpowder we're wasting, we could be making more grenades. 
 You want to come over here and test one? 
 Cute. I need this entire section mined by morning. 
 Then you finish the south field. 
 Hey... 
 I told you, we're going after Finn, Clarke, and Monty in the morning. 
 And I told you, nobody leaves this camp. 
 I'm talking to you. 
 We can't just abandon our people. 
 You want to lead them, show them you give a damn. 
 (Gunshot) 
 Man : Whoa! What the hell was that? 
 Hey... 
 What the hell is the matter with you? 
 I'm sorry, man. I fell asleep. 
 I've been on watch all day. 
 We've all been on watch all day! 
 That bullet was one less dead grounder. 
 Bell, you're scaring people. 
 They should be scared! 
 The bomb on the bridge bought us some time to prepare, but that time is up! 
 The grounders are out there right now, waiting for us to leave and picking us off one by one when we do! 
 Clarke, Finn, and Monty are gone, probably dead, and if you want to be next, I can't stop you, but no guns are leaving this camp! 
 This camp is the only thing keeping us alive! 
 Get back to work! 
 (Snap) 
 (Whinnies) 
 Man : Your left flank is vulnerable. 
 Uh! 
 My archers are in the trees with orders to kill anyone hostile. 
 You're not hostile, are you, Tristan? 
 So this is who's beating you? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm the man sent to slaughter your people. 
 The commander sent you? 
 Your unit is mine now. 
 My rangers are hungry. 
 They're at the river. Go feed them. 
 We march on the invaders' camp at first light. 
 I'll make quick work of what you failed to do, starting with this one. 
 Man : Anya, look! Over there. 
 A signal fire. 
 Reapers. 
 Anya : Let them know we see it. 
 I'll send my fastest rider to warn the commander. 
 Tristan : No. There is no time. 
 Kill the prisoner. Get to the river. 
 Is the boy dead? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Good. Kill the girl, then catch up. 
 Uh! Uh! 
 Uh... 
 (Myles moaning) 
 Don't you think I want to go after them, too? 
 If it was you out there, you think Monty, Clarke, or Finn would hide behind these walls? 
 No. They'd go after me. Then they'd be dead, too. 
 I am doing what I think is right for the group. 
 It's funny, you didn't think that way when Octavia went missing. 
 Where are you going? 
 More gunpowder for your minefield... sir. 
 (Myles moaning) 
 Myles : Water... please. 
 I'll get you some. 
 Water. 
 (Muffled shouting) 
 This is for tying the noose that they hung me with. 
 Say hi to Colin for me. 
 (Shouting stops) 
 (Clank) 
 He stopped breathing. I was... 
 I was trying to help him. 
 Murphy, just put the gun down. 
 He tried to kill me. 
 Hey, don't move. 
 Ok. Ok. 
 It's cool. 
 No, it's not. 
 You know what'll happen to me if you tell Bellamy. 
 Bellamy on walkie-talkie : Tell Bellamy what? 
 Give me the radio, Jasper. 
 Murphy has a gun. He killed Myles. 
 Bellamy : Murphy, what the hell are you doing? 
 (Creaking) 
 Murphy! Murphy! 
 Open the damn door! 
 Murphy : You try to be a hero, Jasper dies. 
 (Nickers) 
 Finn. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 I don't understand how... 
 Finn : Lincoln saved my life. 
 He killed one of his own people to do it. 
 Signal fire? 
 That was you? 
 We needed a distraction. 
 Finn : I'd say it worked. 
 Not well enough. 
 What's it mean? 
 It means Anya knows Clarke is not dead. 
 We need to hurry. 
 Yah! 
 (Whinnies) 
 Let's hope they follow the horse. 
 Hey, what do we do now? 
 Now we run. 
 Lincoln : Come on. It's right up here. 
 What is? 
 Someplace they won't follow. 
 Oh, wait. Where does it lead? 
 Everywhere. There's a tunnel to your camp. 
 If we make it through, we should get there before Tristan. 
 (Hoof beats) 
 Go. Go! 
 Lincoln! 
 Tristan : Anya, no. 
 We know where they're going... 
 If the mine doesn't kill them first. 
 Go. Come on! 
 (Monitor beeping) 
 Abby, BP is dropping down to 96 over 55. 
 Never should've opened her back up. 
 It was the only way to save her. 
 Save her for what? 
 She'll be dead in two days. We all will. 
 (Beeping) 
 She's crashing. 
 (Sustained beep) 
 Another amp of epi. Starting CPR. 
 Come on. 
 We can't give her any more epi, Abby. 
 Rationing is over. Now get me the damn epinephrine. 
 There is no more epinephrine. 
 We're all out. 
 Come on. Come on. Breathe. 
 (Click)   (Beeping stops) 
 You have to let her go. 
 (Sniffles) 
 I failed. I failed. 
 You did the best that you could. 
 You always do. 
 She's gonna hate me forever. 
 She blames me for her father's death. 
 I'll never get to make that right now... 
 Never get to hug her. 
 Can't protect her anymore. 
 Clarke doesn't hate you, Abby. 
 She's just... she's just strong-willed... like her mom. 
 You gave her that. 
 That's how you're protecting her, and that's what will keep her alive on the ground. 
 Thank you, Jackson. 
 Now get out of here. Go on. 
 (Door opens) 
 (Door closes) 
 (Sobs) 
 I just heard Murphy has Jasper. 
 Yeah. South foxhole all done? 
 What? 
 Bellamy, my friend's in there with a killer. 
 O., look around. No one's working. 
 If the grounders attack us right now, we're all dead. 
 Murphy! 
 Murphy, if you even touch Jasper, I swear to God, you're dead. 
 Octavia, I got this. 
 Really? 
 Because it doesn't look like you're doing anything about it. 
 Raven : Bellamy, you were right. 
 There's a loose panel on the back. 
 If I can pop it, we can get in through the floor. 
 Good. Do it. 
 Sorry. 
 Murphy, I know you can hear me. 
 All our ammo and food is in the middle level. 
 You know that. 
 You're leaving us vulnerable to an attack. 
 I can't let that happen. 
 Yeah, well, in case you haven't noticed, you're not exactly in control right now. 
 Come on, Murphy. 
 You don't want to hurt Jasper. 
 You want to hurt me. 
 Bellamy : So what do you say? 
 How about you trade him for me? 
 No. 
 All you have to do is let him go, and I'll take his place. 
 How? 
 Bellamy, if you do this, he'll kill you. 
 If I don't, he'll kill Jasper. 
 Simple. You open the door, I walk in, he walks out. 
 (Creaking) 
 Murphy : Just you, Bellamy, unarmed. 
 Take this. 
 10 seconds, or I'll put one in Jasper's leg. 
 One... 
 Raven will find a way to get you out. 
 I can handle Murphy. 
 Get everyone back to work. 
 The grounders are still coming. 
 4... 5... 
 I'm here. 
 Uh! 
 Oh, Jasper, are you ok? 
 Ok. Come on. Get up. 
 (Stones clacking together) 
 Finn : You were right. They didn't follow us. 
 Reapers use these tunnels. 
 Tristan wouldn't risk running into them. 
 What the hell's a reaper? 
 Pray you never find out. 
 We have to keep moving.  (Grunts) 
 Lincoln, you're hit. 
 Hey, let me look at that. 
 I've fought battles with worse wounds than this. 
 We're not in a battle right now. 
 Yes, we are. 
 Why are you helping us? 
 This can't just be about Octavia. 
 Fine. Don't tell us. Give me your knife. 
 Heat the blade. 
 (Sighs) 
 
 
 
 You might want something to bite down on. 
 (Scoffs)  You people are so soft. 
 If you don't learn to be more... aah! 
 (Grunts) 
 (Panting) 
 What my people are doing to yours is wrong. 
 (Hiss)   (Groans) 
 (Two thuds) 
 (Raven grunts) 
 (Distant, muffled voices) 
 Very cool. 
 Stop thinking like a mechanic and find me something to shoot through. 
 Well, this mechanic's gonna hotwire the door. 
 There's the hatch. 
 Locks from above. Forget it. 
 Bellamy : I give you an order, you follow it, right? 
 Damn it. 
 He's up there because of me. 
 Shh! 
 (Whispering)  Help me find the door circuit. 
 We lost Clarke. 
 We can't lose Bellamy, too. 
 Jasper, shut up. 
 They are, like, right above your head. 
 (Muffled voices continue) 
 Good. 
 I'll have to shoot through the floor. 
 I just need to figure out where Murphy is. 
 Bad idea. 
 (Fluid sloshing) 
 Holy crap. There's tons of it. 
 The engines fired late on the way down. 
 We can make more bombs. 
 Yeah. Put that on our to-do list. 
 But from now on, no shooting, you got me? 
 (Gunshot above) 
 Murphy : That's good. 
 Then do what I said. 
 Octavia over walkie-talkie : Bellamy? 
 Bellamy! Are you ok? 
 You want her to know you're alive? 
 (Sniffles)  Start tying. 
 Octavia : Bellamy! Do you copy? 
 I'm fine. 
 Bellamy : Just a misfire. 
 Now stop worrying about me and get back to work, all of you... 
 And tell Raven to hurry her ass up. 
 All right, that's long enough. 
 Tie those two ends together. 
 Get that door open. 
 All right. Now get up and toss it over. 
 What do you want me to say? 
 You want me to apologize? I'm... 
 I'm sorry. 
 You got it all wrong, Bellamy. 
 I don't want you to say anything. 
 I want you to feel what I felt, and then... then I want you to die. 
 Jaha : What are you two doing over there? 
 Come on. Let's rehearse for the Unity Day pageant. 
 Young Wells : The stations... 
 Jaha : The other stations. 
 The other stations saw this and wanted to be together, too. 
 Jaha : That's very good. 
 When all the stations were joined, they called themselves the Ark. 
 Jaha : Good job, Wells. 
 (Young Clarke clapping) 
 Daddy, how does the Ark stay in space? 
 Good question. 
 By keeping out of the earth's gravitational pull. 
 Young Clarke : My daddy says it's the thrusters. 
 Well, your daddy's right, Clarke. 
 There are thrusters all over the Ark. 
 Every station has them. 
 They keep us spinning so that we generate our own gravity. 
 They help us stay in orbit and they help us steer. 
 Yes. 
 (Bats squeaking, wings flapping) 
 Yes. 
 Wait. If you never were down here, how'd you map it? 
 Spoils of war. 
 (Distant shouting) 
 What is that? 
 (Shouting continues) 
 Reapers. 
 Stand on it. 
 Put it over your head. 
 This is insane. The grounders could... 
 No. 
 We need to do this now. 
 I'm working as fast as I can. 
 The wires for the door are mixed in with the ignition system. 
 Sparking the wrong one would be bad. 
 Put it over your head. 
 Happy now? 
 You're so brave, aren't you? 
 I mean, you came in here thinking you're just gonna turn this whole thing around, that you were stronger than me, and maybe one of your friends would come and help you. 
 Well, what are you thinking now, Bellamy? 
 Hmm? 
 (Choking) 
 Finn : This can't be the only way. Check the map. 
 If you want to get home before Tristan slaughters your people, this is the only way. 
 (Distant shouting) 
 (Thud) 
 Clarke. 
 The carts. 
 What the hell is this? 
 (Shouting) 
 The tunnel on the right will lead you through the woods into your camp. 
 Take this. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I'm gonna lead them away. 
 Wait until they follow me, then run. 
 For Octavia. 
 Wait a second. 
 If they catch you, they'll kill you. 
 Worry about yourselves. 
 Most of Tristan's rangers will be at your gate by nightfall, but he'll send riders ahead, scouts. 
 All of you have to be gone before they arrive. 
 (Shouting) 
 Finn : One of them's coming. 
 Where are we supposed to go? 
 In my book, there's a map. 
 Chart course to the eastern sea. 
 There's a clan there, led by a woman called Luna, a friend. 
 Tell her I sent you. 
 Thank you. 
 Just get Octavia out of there. 
 Aargh! 
 (Thud) 
 (Shouting) 
 Finn : Let's go. 
 Oh, my God. Did you see that? 
 Clarke, we need to keep moving. 
 They're alive. 
 (Groaning) 
 Oh, my God. 
 (Growls)  Clarke, look out! 
 (Distant shouting) 
 Clarke : They're coming back. 
 Finn, come on. 
 We've got to go. Get up, get up. 
 You know, I got to hand it to you, Bellamy. 
 You got 'em all fooled. 
 They actually look up to you, almost as much as they look up to Clarke. 
 Yeah, well, we know the truth, don't we? 
 You're a coward. 
 I learned that the day you kicked out the crate from beneath me. 
 I think I found it. 
 Get outside. 
 Raven : Be ready when it opens. 
 Murphy : Isn't that what you said? 
 That you were just giving the people what they wanted, right? 
 I should have stopped them. 
 Yeah, it's a little late for that now. 
 (Muffled voices continue above) 
 You think they're just gonna let you walk out of here? 
 Well, I think the princess is dead... but I know the king's about to die, so who's really gonna lead these people, huh? 
 Me, that's who, and, yeah, maybe I'll have to kill your grounder-pounding little sister... 
 (grunts) 
 Aah! 
 I'm guessing that's her right now. 
 No! 
 (Gun clicking) 
 (Choking) 
 Using your hands is a cheat. 
 Mine were bound, remember? 
 (Door creaking) 
 Man : Raven, you did it! 
 Octavia : Bell! Hold on! 
 (Grunts) 
 Yeah! 
 Bell, breathe! Breathe! 
 Can you breathe? 
 Come on! 
 (Raspy breathing) 
 Good. You're ok. You're ok. 
 Raven, he's fine! 
 Murphy! 
 (Panting) 
 Murphy! It's over! 
 (Grunts) 
 Bellamy : Murphy! 
 Bellamy : There's only one way out of this for you now! 
 You want to bet? 
 This doesn't look right. 
 What the hell was that back there? 
 (Panting)  Why... why would they keep them alive? 
 I swear to God, the more we learn about this place, the less we know. 
 (Water splashing) 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 He would have killed us. 
 You did what you had to do. 
 We all have. 
 I should have fought for you. 
 Finn, don't. 
 Clarke. 
 I love you. 
 I'm in love with you. 
 You broke my heart. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I... I just can't. 
 (Distant explosion) 
 It came from the camp. 
 We're too late. 
 (Bellamy grunts) 
 Murphy! 
 The guy knows how to make an exit. 
 Should we go after him? 
 No. 
 Grounders will take care of Murphy. 
 We're going after Clarke, Finn, and Monty. 
 You and Raven were right. We don't abandon our own. 
 Two guns... you and me. That's it. 
 Raven stays here to build up defenses. 
 We lost a day because of this, and our gunpowder. 
 Raven! 
 Bellamy, wait. 
 Look, I just... 
 Thank you. 
 Long way from "whatever the hell you want." 
 Miller on walkie-talkie : All gunners! We got movement outside the south wall! 
 Man : Someone's coming! 
 Get ready! 
 Stay together! 
 Wait! Hold your fire! 
 Clarke and Finn! Open the gate! 
 Get it! 
 Get the gate! Move it! 
 Move it! 
 Clarke and Finn! They're back! 
 Hey, we heard an explosion. What happened? 
 Murphy happened. 
 Thank God! 
 Where have you been? Where's Monty? 
 Monty's gone? 
 Clarke, we need to leave, now. 
 All of us do. 
 There's an army of grounders, unlike anything we've ever seen, coming for us right now. 
 We need to pack what we can and run. 
 Like hell we do. We knew this was coming. 
 Octavia : Bell, we're not prepared. 
 And they're not here yet. 
 We still have time to get ready. 
 Besides, where would we go? 
 Where would we be safer than behind these walls? 
 Finn : There's an ocean to the east. 
 People there will help us. 
 Octavia : You saw Lincoln. 
 Yeah. 
 Bellamy : You expect us to trust a grounder? 
 This is our home now. 
 We built this from nothing with our bare hands! 
 Our dead are buried behind that wall in this ground! 
 Our ground! 
 The grounders think they can take that away. 
 They think that because we came from the sky, we don't belong here. 
 But they're yet to realize one very important fact: We are on the ground now, and that means we are grounders! 
 Yeah! 
 Grounders with guns! 
 Damn right! I say let 'em come! 
 Bellamy's right. 
 If we leave, we may never find a place as safe as this. 
 And God knows, in this world, we could be faced with something even worse tomorrow. 
 But that doesn't change the simple fact that if we stay here, we will die tonight. 
 So pack your things. 
 Just take what you can carry, now. 
 (Overlapping chatter) 
 Where is he? 
 Raven : Help me. 
 Raven! Raven! 
 Raven. Raven's here! 
 Murphy shot her. 
 Clarke : Get her onto the dropship. 
 Clarke, leaving here is a mistake. 
 The decision's been made. 
 Crowds make bad decisions. 
 Just ask Murphy. 
 Leaders do what they think is right. 
 I am. 
 Kane : What if we jettison sections 3 through 7? 
 Sinclair : Sir, we've run every scenario twice. 
 There are no more options. 
 I would really like to be with my wife... 
 (door opens) 
 Chancellor on deck. 
 At ease, Sinclair. 
 Anything to report? 
 No, sir. 
 Nothing we've tried will save the Ark. 
 Have you tried not saving it? 
 What is this about? 
 It's about going home. 
 Jaha : From where I stand, we have two options... die in space or probably die trying to get to the ground. 
 We have no more Exodus ships, sir. 
 You're wrong, Kane. 
 There is one. 
 We call it the Ark. 
 Jaha : Sinclair, please tell us what would happen if we use the thrusters that keep the Ark in orbit to propel us into the atmosphere instead. 
 The Ark would break apart, first into its original 12 stations, then further as the violence intensified. 
 95% of the structures would explode on the way down. 
 You think you're smart enough to pinpoint the 5% that wouldn't? 
 (Sets down schematic) 
 Are we really gonna do this? 
 Bring the Ark to the ground? 
 Have a better idea? 
 What do you say, Abby? 
 You ready to see your daughter again?
