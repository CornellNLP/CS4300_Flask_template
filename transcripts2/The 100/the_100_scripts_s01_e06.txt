 I was born in space. I've never felt the sun on my face, or breathed real air or floated in water. None of us have. For 3 generations, The Ark has kept what's left of the human race alive. But now our home is dying, and we are the last hope of mankind. 100 prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground. Each of us was sent here before we broke the law. On the ground, there is no law. All we have to do is survive, but we will be tested... by the Earth, by the secrets it hides, and most of all, by each other. 
 Announcer : Previously on "The 100"... 
 Calm down! 
 We're dead to them! And we're alone! 
 You're not alone! 
 You're not alone. 
 Raven! 
 Finn! 
 Raven : The council is voting whether to kill 300 people to save air. 
 We have to tell them! 
 The radio's gone. 
 (Woman crying) 
 Mom, please, let me get a doctor. 
 No! You can't tell anyone. 
 Tell me what happens if you do. Say it. 
 Y... you get floated. 
 I don't understand. 
 Why is it wrong to have more than one baby? 
 The Ark couldn't survive. 
 The chancellor can't allow it. 
 He's, like, the Emperor Augustus, right? 
 That's right. 
 Just like the emperor we read about. 
 The baby's coming. Get the blanket. 
 (Groans) 
 (Baby crying) 
 My brave boy. You have a sister. 
 You should name her. 
 Augustus had a sister. 
 Octavia. 
 (Fussing) 
 Bellamy, you can't let her cry. 
 Here. Give her to me. 
 No, mom, mom, you can't fall asleep. 
 I'm so tired. 
 Your sister. 
 Your responsibility. 
 Mom, mom, what do I do? Mom! 
 (Crying) 
 Shh. Please. Shh. 
 See? I told you. It's ok. 
 I won't let anything bad happen to you, Octavia. 
 I promise. 
 Octavia! 
 You're up? 
 Yeah. Knowing that hundreds of people might be dying on The Ark makes it pretty hard to sleep. 
 Raven's flares will work. 
 Her radio would've worked better. 
 Have you seen Octavia? 
 No. It's Octavia. 
 She's probably chasing butterflies. 
 Clarke, I've checked the camp. 
 She's not here. 
 Ok. I'll help you find her. 
 Let's check again. 
 You go to the dropship. 
 I'll check the rest of the tents. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't thank me. I'm not doing this for you. 
 I'm doing it for Octavia. 
 (Groaning) 
 (Groaning) 
 (Groaning) 
 Uhh. 
 (Footsteps) 
 Aah! Aah! 
 Please, please don't hurt me. 
 Please don't... no... aah! No! No! 
 No, please! No! No! Aah! 
 Bellamy : Hey, everybody, gather around and grab a weapon. 
 My sister's been out there alone for 12 hours. 
 Arm up. We're not coming back without her. 
 Hey, Jasper, you don't have to do this. 
 You haven't left camp since we brought you back. 
 Clarke, I need to do this. 
 We need all the people we can get. 
 We need a tracker. 
 Finn. Get out here. 
 You want to lose an ear? 
 Can't believe you let it get so long in lockup. 
 This couldn't wait till morning? 
 I was inspired. So. 
 What did you want to talk about? 
 Nothing. It can wait. 
 That wasn't your "nothing" face. 
 That was your "going on a spacewalk" face. 
 No more spacewalks. 
 Get some rest, ok? 
 Man : Finn, we're leaving. 
 Finn : All right. I'm coming. 
 Hey. Hey, wait. 
 Nice hair. 
 We should talk about this. 
 You have a girlfriend, Finn. 
 There's really nothing left to say. 
 Hey, hold on. It's true. 
 I care about Raven. 
 But you and me, we started something. 
 It's nothing we can't stop. 
 Are you sure? 
 Because I'm not. 
 Man : Guys, guys. Come here! 
 Did you see that? 
 Look up there. 
 It's so beautiful. 
 Raven : They didn't work. 
 They didn't see the flares. 
 Bellamy : A meteor shower tells you that? 
 It's not a meteor shower, it's a funeral. 
 Hundreds of bodies being returned to the Earth from The Ark. 
 This is what it looks like from the other side. 
 They didn't get our message. 
 This is all because of you! 
 I helped you find the radio. 
 Yeah, after you jacked it from my pod and trashed it! 
 Yeah, he knows. 
 Now has to live with it. 
 All I know is that my sister is out there and I'm gonna find her. 
 You coming or what? 
 Yeah. 
 What are we waiting for? 
 Move out! 
 Clarke : We have to talk to them. 
 300 won't be enough. 
 The oxygen level will just keep dropping. 
 And if we don't tell them that they can survive down here, they'll kill more people. 
 They have to. 
 Guys... 
 They're leaving. We gotta go. 
 I gotta do this. 
 And you should stay and fix the radio, ok? 
 Fix it? The transmitter's smashed. 
 Unless there's a parts depot down here, we're not talking to The Ark. 
 Art supply store. 
 I know a place you might be able to get a transmitter. 
 Great. It looks like you're coming with me instead. 
 Finn? We're not gonna find her without you. 
 Be careful. 
 Hey. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 It's this way. 
 (Gasping) 
 Hello? 
 Is anybody here? 
 He fixed it? 
 Uhh. 
 Uhh! 
 Uhh! 
 Look! Over here! 
 What is it? 
 Right there. You see it? 
 Is that Octavia's? 
 Rope. 
 What are you doing? 
 We need the rope to get back up. 
 Flashlight. 
 (Breathing heavily) 
 It's hers. 
 Bellamy : I'm going all the way down. 
 Someone else was here. 
 The prints are deeper going that way. 
 He was carrying her. 
 If they took her, she's alive. 
 Like when they took me. 
 Aah! 
 (Gasping) 
 I don't speak Grounder... 
 But I'm pretty sure this means keep out. 
 Man : Let's get out of here. It's crazy. 
 Different man : I'm outta here. 
 Different man : Yeah, me, too. 
 Different man : I'm out. 
 Go back if you want. My sister, my responsibility. 
 I'd walk into hell to find her. 
 I think we just did. 
 (Octavia laughs) 
 Go! 
 I want another pony ride. 
 You want another one? 
 Ha ha! 
 Ok, you want to go through the jungle or the forest? 
 I want to see The Ark, Bell. 
 Take me out the door. 
 That's enough. Both of you. 
 It's time. 
 But... no. 
 I don't want to! 
 How do you even know? 
 Yeah, mom, tell us why you're never surprised by surprise inspections. 
 Mind yourself, Bellamy Blake. 
 Tell your sister what happens if they find her. 
 She knows what happens. 
 You've told her a thousand times. 
 O. You know the drill. 
 I hate the drill. 
 Sometimes I wish I was never even born. 
 Stop it, Octavia. I know you're afraid, but fear is a demon. 
 Close your eyes and tell yourself that you are not afraid. 
 That is how you slay the demon. 
 (Knocking on door) 
 Say it. 
 I'm not afraid. 
 Ok. 
 (Knocking on door) 
 (Knocking on door) 
 Man : Open the door, now! 
 (Hatch closes) 
 Miss Blake, by authority of the council, we're here to perform a random inspection. 
 Aurora : Inspector Grus, it's good to see you. 
 Your uniform's ready. 
 There you go. Just like new. 
 Do you have something for me? 
 Bellamy's letter of recommendation. 
 You think you're guard material, kid? 
 Come here. Let's have a look at you. 
 I'm good, thanks. 
 Bellamy. Stand up. Now. 
 I'm not afraid. 
 I don't think so. 
 You want to be in the guard or not? 
 Come here. 3 seconds. 
 1... 2... 
 Bellamy! I'm so sorry, Inspector. 
 I... 
 Grus : Don't be. 
 Maybe the guard will make a man out of him. 
 Clean that up. 
 Sir. 
 Come to my quarters later. 
 He'll get that recommendation. 
 I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. 
 (Breathing heavily) 
 I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. 
 I'm not afraid. 
 They're so beautiful. 
 Clarke : Raven, I know you just got here yesterday, but we don't have time for this. 
 Come on. 
 Hurry up and save the world. You're just like your mom. 
 I'm nothing like my mom. 
 Relax. That's a compliment. 
 Abby's a badass. 
 The pod was her idea. 
 It broke her heart not being able to come down with me, but she never stopped believing you were alive. 
 Yeah. Mother of the year. 
 Well, my mom was awol most of my life. 
 When she did show up, it was empty-handed. 
 Pretty sure she had me just to trade in my rations for moonshine. 
 How'd you survive? 
 Boy next door. Finn. 
 He shared his rations. Remembered my birthday. 
 Saved my life. 
 He's my family. 
 
 
 
 (Hatch opens) 
 (Sighs)  I got nothing. 
 We lost the trail. 
 Keep looking. 
 Wandering around aimlessly isn't the way to find your sister. 
 We should backtrack... 
 I'm not going back. 
 Hey, where's John? 
 I just saw him a second ago. 
 Spread out. He couldn't have gotten that far. 
 They use the trees. 
 We shouldn't have crossed the boundary. 
 Now can we go back? 
 There. 
 Another one. 
 We should run. 
 Let's try this one. 
 How did you find this place? 
 I didn't. Finn found it. 
 Hey, will this work? 
 Sweet. RF. Radio frequency. 
 If we can just find the controller, we'll be golden. 
 All right. 
 Finn made this. 
 Huh? 
 Oh, uh, yeah. 
 Uh, we saw this two-headed deer our first day on the ground. 
 Welcome to paradise, right? 
 Got it. 
 Finn always does that. 
 Finds the beauty in the unexpected. 
 Good to go? 
 Hurry up and save the world, right? 
 Yeah. We're good. 
 Ok. 
 Let's go! Let's go! 
 Man : What are we gonna do? They keep heading us off. 
 Second man : Just keep running. 
 Jasper : I can't run much longer! 
 Diggs : I'm not stopping for him! 
 I'm sick of running anyway. 
 Hey, what are you doing? 
 They know where she is. 
 Roma : Diggs, where are you? 
 Diggs : Roma! 
 (Breathing heavily) 
 Aah! 
 Bellamy : Wait! Roma. 
 Finn : Could be more. Stop. 
 They were leading us here. 
 It's the only direction we could run in. 
 Hey. Where'd they go? 
 After Roma. 
 Woman : Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Oh. You'll never guess what's about to happen. 
 Inspection. I'll get in the hole. 
 No, no, no, no, no. Sit, sit. 
 This is great. 
 Please, Bell, I don't want to hear about another amazing moonrise when I'm never gonna be able to see one. 
 You're going to see one right now. 
 The Unity Day masquerade dance starts in 10 minutes. 
 Now, I didn't want to say anything until I was sure my cadet unit was working security. 
 I'm gonna be there watching you the entire time. 
 This is real? 
 How do I look? 
 (Giggles) 
 Mysterious. 
 Oh, Bell, what about mom? 
 Hey, will you stop worrying? 
 We'll be back before she even knows you're gone. 
 Want to go for a walk? 
 It's ok. 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 (Upbeat music playing) 
 Whoa. 
 Who's that? 
 Another girl who won't notice us. 
 Uhh. My leg. 
 I need to rest. 
 Thank you. You saved my life. 
 That girl back there, I knew her, so, if she's here, then so is my brother. 
 Please, you have to help him, too. They'll kill him. 
 You don't understand me, do you? Great. 
 Why are you taking care of me? 
 You found me at the bottom of that ravine. 
 Fixed my knee. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Please don't do this. 
 Aah! Stop it! No, stop it! 
 Stop! Please! Please don't do this. 
 (Crying) 
 There she is. Roma! 
 They're playing with us. 
 She only came because of me. 
 They can kill us whenever they want. 
 Then they should get it over with! 
 Come on! 
 We know you're out there! 
 You want to kill us... 
 Bellamy! 
 (Horn blowing) 
 They're leaving. 
 (Horn) 
 That horn. What does it mean? 
 Acid fog. 
 (Horn) 
 We have to run. 
 There's no time. 
 (Upbeat music playing) 
 Boy : Nice eyes. 
 What station are you from? 
 (Music stops) 
 Woman on P.A. : Solar flare alert. 
 An x-class solar flare has begun on the starboard side of The Ark. 
 All citizens must report to the nearest shelter zone immediately. 
 This is not a test. This is a solar flare alert. 
 Bell, I need to get home! 
 You will. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, you know the drill. 
 Masks off. I.D. chips out. 
 Bell, what do we do? 
 Listen to me. Whatever happens, you get back home and get under the floor. 
 You'll be safe there from the flare, like always. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Create a distraction. Go on. 
 Bell, how do I get home? 
 Cadet Blake. Why is your weapon out? 
 Mask off. 
 Sir, she's... she's fine. I already scanned her. 
 You don't have a scanner. 
 I.D., please. 
 Please, Lieutenant Shumway, I'm begging you, she needs to leave. 
 As a fellow guardsman... just let us walk out of here and I'll do anything you want. 
 Anything. 
 You're not a guardsman yet, cadet. 
 I.D. now. 
 Man : Stop her. 
 How long are we supposed to wait? 
 Will this even work? 
 We'll find out. 
 No, we won't. 
 There's no fog. 
 Finn : Maybe it was a false alarm. 
 They're coming back. 
 I think he's alone. 
 Now can we run? 
 He doesn't see us. I'm going after him. 
 And what? Kill him? 
 No. Catch him. 
 Make him tell me where Octavia is, then kill him. 
 How do we know he's not leading us to another trap? 
 We don't. 
 How's it coming? 
 Are you ok? 
 You hardly said a word the whole way back from the bunker. 
 (Clatter) 
 Raven... 
 Tell me I'm wrong. 
 Tell me Finn didn't make this for you. 
 Tell me you weren't screwing my boyfriend as I was risking my ass to come down here. 
 I can't tell you that. 
 He made one for me, too. 
 Just in case you thought you were special. 
 Do you think I wanted this? 
 I didn't even know you existed. 
 Look, as far as he knew, you were dead, Raven. 
 Or you would have been soon enough. 
 My mom, too, and everyone we ever knew on The Ark, and there was nothing we could do to stop it. 
 He could've waited more than 10 days. 
 Ahh.  (Exhales) 
 Do you love him? 
 I hardly know him. 
 (Clatter) 
 Uhh! 
 Uhh! 
 (Footsteps) 
 Bellamy? 
 Octavia. 
 Get the key. 
 (Puff) 
 Monroe, watch the entrance. 
 Uhh! 
 It's ok. You're ok. 
 (knocking on door) 
 Cadet Blake. 
 It's Janitor Blake now, Lieutenant. 
 Commander. A lot's changed in the past year. 
 May I? 
 You've got some nerve coming here after pushing the button that floated my mother. 
 I was following orders. 
 What the hell do you want from me? 
 You were a hell of a guardsman, Bellamy, you know that? 
 Smart, hardworking, resourceful. 
 I wasn't a guardsman. 
 That's what you said. I remember. 
 You also said you'd do anything to protect your sister. 
 I remember, too. 
 I hope that's still true. 
 Is she ok? 
 What I'm about to tell you is classified. 
 Chancellor Jaha has approved a mission to Earth. 
 He's sending the juvenile prisoners to the ground. 
 100 of them. Your sister included. 
 N... no. You can't. It's not safe. 
 You have to stop them. 
 I wish I could. 
 What I can do is get you a seat on that dropship. 
 You're right. It's doubtful those kids will survive, but if you're there, at least Octavia won't be alone. 
 What do I have to do? 
 Kill the chancellor. 
 How about I kill you instead? 
 Kill me and your sister goes alone to a radiation-soaked planet and you get floated like your mother. 
 Ship launches in 20 minutes, Bellamy. 
 If you're gonna do this, we have to leave. 
 Right now. 
 How did you find me? 
 Followed him. 
 We should go. Now. Before he wakes up. 
 He's not gonna wake up. 
 Bellamy, stop. 
 He didn't hurt me. Let's just go. 
 They started this. Finn. Move. 
 Foghorn. 
 (Men grunting) 
 Stop! That's my brother! 
 (Thud) 
 Jasper : Clarke! Where's Clarke? 
 Get Clarke now. 
 Hey. I'm here. What's up? 
 Octavia. 
 Finn. Finn? 
 Oh, my God. Oh, oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
 He's alive. 
 Bellamy wouldn't let me take the knife out. 
 No, that was a good call. 
 Clarke : Get him in the dropship now. Go! 
 Clarke, can you save him? 
 No. Not me. I need my mother. 
 I need to talk to her. 
 There's still no radio. 
 Raven, fix it! Go! 
 Hey, you ok? 
 Ok. Yeah. Just go. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Why were you defending him? 
 Because he saved my life. 
 That spear that hit Roma was actually meant... 
 No, you're wrong. I saved your life. 
 For all you know, he was keeping you alive to use you as bait for one of their traps. 
 No. I don't think so. 
 You don't think, O! That's the problem. 
 They killed 3 of our people today. 
 And if you would've let me kill him when I had the chance, Finn wouldn't be in there dying right now. 
 Stop blaming me for your mistakes. 
 What happened to Finn is not my fault. 
 I wanted to leave, so if Finn dies in there, that's on you. 
 Everything that's gone wrong is because of you. 
 You got me locked up on The Ark. 
 You wanted me to go to that stupid dance. 
 You got mom killed! 
 Me?  (Sniffles) 
 Mom was floated for having you. 
 She's dead because you're alive. 
 That was her choice. 
 I didn't have a choice. 
 My life ended the day you were born. 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 You can't keep me locked up in here forever. 
 Get inside. 
 Go! 
 A storm's coming.
