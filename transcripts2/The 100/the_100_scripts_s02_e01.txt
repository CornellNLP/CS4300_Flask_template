 Clarke  (V.O.): Previously on The 100. It's been 97 years since a nuclear apocalypse killed everyone on Earth. 
 Abby : You're being sent to the ground. All 100 of you. 
 Jaha : Prisoners of the Ark, you have one job: Stay alive. 
 Jasper : We did it! 
 Clarke : We are not alone. 
 Finn : The last man from the ground died on the Ark? He wasn't the last Grounder. 
 Clarke : There's an army of Grounders coming for us right now. Jasper, now.  
 [Screaming] 
 Abby : Are we really going to do this? Bring the Ark to the ground. 
 Jaha : Friction will break the Ark back into its original stations. Hailing all Ark survivors. 
 Abby : Mecha Station is on the ground. Look. It might be another station. 
 Kane : Find the rest of our people, Abby. Find Clarke.  
 [Coughing] 
 Clarke : Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey! Where's Monty? What the hell did you do to him? 
 (Crash) 
 (Glass shatters) 
 Ah! 
 What are you doing? 
 I'll be contaminated. 
 Where's my friend? 
 He's fine. You don't understand, ok? 
 He's... uhh! 
 Take me to him. 
 Uhh! Clarke, you're bleeding. 
 How do you know my name? 
 It was on your chart. 
 How do they know my name? 
 I don't know. Please don't hurt me. 
 You want to live?  (Rattles doorknob) 
 Do exactly what I say. 
 I don't think so. 
 Key card. 
 I just need my key card. 
 (Beeping) 
 (Sobbing) 
 Which level? 
 Who are you people? 
 Answer me. 
 How many of us are here? 
 Where are they? Say something! 
 Woman on recording : Arrived. Level 5. 
 (Piano playing) 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Containment breach. Containment breach! 
 (People screaming) 
 Where the hell am I? 
 Monroe : Bellamy? 
 Get back down. 
 You were followed? 
 Quiet. 
 Have you seen Finn? 
 Finn's alive? 
 He was. 
 We got separated. 
 We knew the fire was coming, so, we ran, but one of them followed. 
 How'd you guys get out? 
 We... we saw the Ark come down. 
 We thought we'd come get help. 
 Piece of it came down this way. 
 Monroe thinks it's Mecha, but personally, I think... 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Follow me. 
 Stay low and quiet. 
 I can't... I can't go anymore. 
 Uhh! Ooh! 
 On your feet. 
 I can't. 
 He can't keep up. 
 I said get on your feet. 
 (Coughing) 
 Get up. 
 Uhh! 
 No! Uhh! 
 No! 
 That's one. 
 I lost 300. 
 Uhh. 
 Drink. You're lucky. 
 I need to keep one of you alive to talk to the commander. 
 Get up. 
 Ai laik okteivia kom skai kru en ai gaf gouthru klin. 
 "Klir," not "klin." 
 "Gouthru klir." Again. 
 "I'm Octavia of the sky people and I seek safe passage." 
 Why do I even have to learn this? 
 You speak English. 
 Only our warriors speak English. 
 When we get to the sea, you need to sound like one of us. 
 Then we have time. 
 Tell me about this one. 
 A statue near my village. 
 A place we go to settle disputes. 
 Stop stalling and pull it out. 
 (Gasping) 
 No warning? Nothing? 
 (Groaning) 
 I take it back. No warning is better. 
 (Groaning) 
 Ahh. Oh, my God. 
 (Sigh) 
 (Spits)  Poison. 
 I'm guessing this means you don't have the antidote? 
 No. I gave it to Finn to save Raven. 
 So, we go back. 
 It's too far. 
 It's further to the sea. 
 Damn it. 
 Lincoln, we are not going back to your village. 
 You know what they do to traitors. 
 Octavia. 
 Death by 1,000 cuts. 
 Every single member of your clan will take a turn stabbing you, and then they'll feed you to the bugs. 
 It's what you told me. 
 Here. Take this. 
 Here. Hey. 
 I will be right back. 
 Lincoln, where are you going? 
 The antidote. 
 It comes from the beetles that feed on the river moss. 
 You're gonna feed on the beetles. 
 It'll work. 
 Uhh! 
 (Groaning) 
 (Gasp) 
 (Grunting) 
 (Gasping) 
 W... whoa, it's ok. 
 It's ok, Raven, don't. 
 Don't shoot. Please. 
 Why not? You shot me. 
 (Click) 
 (Click click) 
 (Click) 
 (Sigh) 
 (Gasping) 
 (Sigh) 
 (Sigh) 
 Yeah, I would've shot me, too. 
 (Clarke gasping) 
 Hello, Clarke. 
 How is your arm? 
 Not much of a talker, is she? 
 Skill picked up from the savages, no doubt. 
 That's fine. 
 Maya has something to say first anyway. 
 You were the next one to be cleared through quarantine. 
 Another 10 minutes and you would've... 
 Ahem. 
 I'm not pressing charges. 
 Thank you, Maya. 
 You can get your treatment now. 
 Dr. Tsing : Ok. Let's go. 
 Bed 3. 
 Restraints aren't necessary. 
 Yes, Mr. President. 
 Dante Wallace. 
 Oil paint. 
 That's right. You're an artist, too. 
 Who told you that? 
 Your people did. 
 They also said you were their leader. 
 Looks like you and I have a lot in common, kiddo. 
 Where's my watch? 
 I'm sorry, but we can't let contaminated items inside Mount Weather. 
 We couldn't risk it. 
 Our protocol is very strict, Clarke. 
 We prioritize safety over sentimentality. 
 How many of us did you capture? 
 48, including you, but Clarke, you've got it wrong. 
 You're not prisoners. We saved you. 
 Well, in that case, you won't mind if we leave. 
 If there are 48 of us here, we still have people out there. 
 The patrol brought in everyone they could find. 
 What about the Ark? It came down last... 
 We saw it. There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles. 
 If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too. 
 You have my word. 
 I want to see my people. 
 Of course you do. I would, too. 
 Change and meet me in the hall. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 Let's give Clarke some privacy. 
 (Door closes) 
 (Machine whirring) 
 Dante : Ok. Just take care of it. 
 Sorry about the noise. 
 Hydroelectric power from philpott dam. 
 Fresh water from our own underground reservoir. 
 Fresh food from our hydroponic farm. 
 I don't understand. You're on the ground. 
 You know it's survivable. 
 Why would you stay here? 
 It's not survivable for us. 
 The Grounders seem to have managed. 
 Natural selection works. 
 The Grounders who couldn't survive in the radiation didn't. 
 Those who could passed on their DNA. 
 For better or for worse here, we never went through that process. 
 Well, neither did we. 
 We've been on the ground now for... solar radiation. 
 Very good. Your DNA ran the same gauntlet as the Grounders. 
 Only because radiation levels in space are even higher, your ability to metabolize that radiation is even stronger. 
 Truth be told, our scientists were blown away by the efficiency of your systems. 
 If not for that, your friends would still be upstairs in quarantine. 
 Please. 
 First give me the heel. 
 You're not fighting for your life anymore, Clarke. 
 You've made it. 
 Welcome to Mount Weather. 
 Woman on recording : Arrived. Level 5. 
 Woman : Your packet contains everything you need to know about Mount Weather, which I promise is not as confusing as the map on page one makes it up to look. 
 (People chuckling) 
 You came from level 3, which houses our medical facility. 
 Clarke. 
 (Sigh)  Hi. 
 You're ok. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Oh, my... 
 Finn and Bellamy? 
 Clarke, they... they didn't make it. 
 We don't know that. 
 What about Raven? 
 Woman : Welcome, Clarke. 
 If you have any questions, I'm Keenan. 
 (Sigh) 
 What are you doing here, Murphy? 
 (Clatter) 
 Dying. Same as you. 
 Speak for yourself.  (Grunts) 
 (Sigh)  How many more are out there? 
 None.  (Sigh) 
 You fried them all. The only reason this one survived is because they left him behind to guard me. 
 (Gasp) 
 (Coughing, gasping) 
 Raven. Lie on your side. 
 Lie on your side. Come on. 
 Fine, then just roll over yourself. 
 Get down on your side. 
 You're ok. It's all good. 
 Why are you helping me? 
 I don't want to die alone. 
 I know you're scared, but we are warriors. 
 We can do this. 
 How? 
 We attack as a team. 
 When he goes for me, Monroe goes for Finn. 
 Once he's free, it's 4 on one. 
 What do I do? 
 Try not to die. 
 Ready? 1, 2, 3. 
 Hey! 
 Man : Bellamy, get out of here! 
 Hyah! 
 Hyah! 
 Aah! 
 Uhh! 
 (Horse nickers) 
 (Both grunting) 
 (Octavia screaming) 
 Octavia. Octavia. What is it? 
 Hey. What... what's wrong? What... wait, wait, wait. 
 Hey! 
 I saw a man. 
 It was... it was a... a monster. 
 It's the poison. You're burning up. 
 We have to hurry. 
 I know what we have to do. 
 What are you doing? Where are we going? 
 Just hold on. 
 
 
 
 (Piano playing) 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 You have to try this pie. 
 Oh, my God. What is that? 
 I don't know, but it's great. 
 Mm. My turn. 
 What, this? Nah. You won't like it. 
 The pie's way better. 
 Really? 
 (Clatter) 
 Ok. 
 Oh. Hey. Clarke. 
 Sit down and pretend you're happy to see me. 
 We are happy to see you. 
 You have to try the chocolate cake. 
 Oh, it is so on. 
 I'm not eating their food. 
 Look. 
 They gave us a map with no exits. 
 I need you to tell me everything you've seen. 
 Every room, every hallway, every way out. 
 Way out? 
 Look around you, Clarke. 
 There's no one hunting us here. 
 First time in our lives we're not hungry. 
 Why would we want to leave? 
 Because we have friends out there who need our help. 
 They're looking for survivors, and they're way better equipped to find them than we are. 
 This place is too good to be true. 
 You're bumming me out. I'm... I'm gonna get more cake. 
 (Sigh) 
 Take mine. 
 Thanks. Jasper. 
 Maya. 
 Cold hands. 
 Low vitamin D. 
 Unlike yours, which is off the charts, by the way. 
 Well. All right. I was excited. 
 Mm. Oh. 
 (Chuckles) 
 No chocolate in space, huh? 
 Space sucked. 
 What's the deal with all this stuff, anyway? 
 This is nothing. 
 There's an entire warehouse with just paintings. 
 President Wallace is the first to hang them up. 
 Guess he figured just because we don't have windows doesn't mean we can't have a view. 
 Hey. 
 It's Maya, right? 
 I just wanted to say sorry for this morning. 
 I was scared and worried about my friends. 
 I hope you can understand that. 
 I know she's intense, but... 
 Clarke's the only reason we survived. 
 She took my key card. 
 Woman on P.A. : Alert. Code 5. 
 Not a prisoner, huh? 
 (Beeping) 
 (Electricity crackling) 
 Man : Get that door open. 
 Now stand clear. 
 (Loud beep) 
 Woman on P.A. : Unauthorized access. 
 (Loud beep) 
 Woman on P.A. : Unauthorized access. 
 (Loud beep) 
 Woman on P.A. : Unauthorized access. 
 Woman on P.A. : Unauthorized access. 
 Clarke, no! 
 If you pull that lever, these people will die. 
 Even a little radiation can kill them. 
 Woman on P.A. : Unauthorized access. 
 Don't make me shoot you. 
 (Loud beep) 
 Wait. 
 Wait. 
 Clarke. 
 Don't do this. 
 I don't believe them. 
 Why would they lie? 
 Listen to me. We are safe here because of you. 
 We're safe. 
 Not all of us. 
 I'm the one that fired the rockets. 
 Should I not have done that? 
 Clarke... when you pulled that lever, you saved lives. 
 Don't throw that away by pulling this one. 
 (Crying) 
 (Footsteps) 
 Man : There she is! Hold it right there. 
 Second man : Get your hands up. 
 (Grunting) 
 How did you get to be such a dick, Murphy? 
 I'm sorry for shooting you, ok? 
 Is that what you want to hear? 
 Let me guess. Mommy and daddy didn't love you? 
 No, they loved me. 
 Are you gonna cry, Murphy? 
 Screw you, Raven. 
 No, tell me. I want to know. 
 How does a kid who's loved by his parents turn into a murdering psychopath? 
 He gets the flu. 
 His father steals medicine that turns out wouldn't help anyway. 
 Gets floated for it and... his mother, she starts drinking pretty heavily after that and... last words she says to him before he finds her in a pool of her own vomit is that... is that he killed his father. 
 Boo-hoo. 
 You have to stand on your feet. 
 He'll kill you if you don't. 
 We're warriors. We're warriors. 
 We're warriors. We are warriors. 
 (Both shouting indistinctly) 
 (Shouting stops) 
 We're here now. 
 Everything's gonna be ok. 
 (whistling) 
 (Indistinct shouting) 
 Don't stand up. 
 I'm fine. We need to get back to the dropship. 
 Hey. Where's Clarke? Is she all right? 
 She was when we left. 
 We'll take you to her. 
 Wait. Slow down. 
 Sinclair. 
 We're splitting up. 
 One guard detail comes with me to the dropship. 
 Everyone else here goes with you to Alpha Station. 
 You have the coordinates. We'll follow as soon as we can. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Anything more from Jaha? 
 No. Nothing in the past hour. 
 Ok. You six with me. 
 You two, lead the way. 
 Man : All right, let's go. Come on. 
 We're on the move. Let's go. 
 You're almost there, Abby. 
 Octavia : Ai laik okteivia kom skai kru en ai gaf gouthru klir. 
 Once more. Come on, say it. 
 Come on. 
 Ai laik okteivia kom skai... you know, you still haven't even told me where we're going. 
 Can't you smell it? 
 We're almost to the sea. 
 No, I can't smell anything. 
 Lincoln, I'm scared. 
 It's too quiet. 
 We'll take it from here. 
 Banks, Scanlon, you stay with them. 
 We'll signal once we're sure it's safe. 
 Murphy : Help her. 
 Raven. Raven. 
 (Sigh)  Raven. Raven, honey, it's Abby. 
 Clarke's not here. 
 I don't know where she is. 
 What happened to you? 
 I got shot. 
 I got shot. 
 Man : We need a stretcher! 
 Second man : Sir. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Man : Hey, hold it right there. 
 Second man : Get back here! 
 Uhh. 
 Where is everyone? 
 (People grunting) 
 Murphy : It was awful. 
 There was hundreds of them and if it wasn't for Raven... uhh... I don't know what happened. 
 Bellamy. You're... you're alive. 
 Aah! You murdering son of a bitch! 
 Man : Stop... ! 
 (Electricity humming) 
 (Electricity crackling) 
 (Gasping) 
 Place him under arrest. 
 Finn : Wait. You don't understand. 
 Murphy murdered two of our people. 
 He shot another one. He tried to hang Bellamy. 
 I don't care. You are not animals. 
 There are rules. 
 Laws. 
 You are not in control here anymore. 
 Raven. 
 Abby : She's lost a lot of blood. 
 It's a miracle that she's still alive. 
 There's no one else in there. 
 Come on. Put her down over here. 
 (Lincoln breathing heavily) 
 ... now sleep. 
 Be back with the antidote as soon as I can. 
 You brought me to your village? 
 I won't let you die. 
 Lincoln... Lincoln... 
 Hey, hey. 
 They'll kill you. 
 Hey. Only if they catch me. 
 Stay alive. 
 And stay quiet. 
 (Opera music playing) 
 Lose the handcuffs. 
 There's a blank canvas if you'd like. 
 I used to paint the ground, too. 
 It's not just the ground. 
 It's a memory. 
 You've been outside? 
 Yes. 56 years ago. 
 For 5 minutes. 
 I was 7 when the first of what we call the outsiders appeared. 
 Before that, we thought we were all there was. 
 Imagine our surprise. 
 I don't have to imagine. 
 My father, this was his office at the time, believed it meant that the Earth was survivable again, and so, he opened the doors. 
 Within a week, 54 people were dead from the exposure. 
 My mother and sister among them. 
 Loss... pain, regret. 
 Time eases these things, Clarke, but the only time it's ever truly gone is when I'm painting. 
 You didn't bring me here to talk about painting. 
 Did you? 
 I'm afraid I have bad news. 
 Our patrols have swept the area and found no evidence of survivors, either at your camp or from the Ark. 
 How can they be sure? 
 They can't. 
 I've ordered them to keep searching. 
 I need to see for myself. 
 I'm sorry. I can't allow that. 
 I'm doing this for your own good, Clarke. 
 It's not safe out there. 
 Radiation has no effect on us. 
 It's not the radiation I'm concerned about. 
 You need time to grieve. 
 These men will show you to your room. 
 And if I try to leave? 
 Please don't test me, Clarke. 
 We're leaving. 
 What? 
 This is where they'll come back. 
 I don't think they're coming back. 
 The Grounders took them and you know that. 
 Look... we go with Kane to Alpha Station, we get reinforcements, weapons, then we find our friends. 
 One question. 
 How many more of us will be dead by then? 
 Abby says Raven needs surgery or she's gonna die. 
 It's time to go. 
 Abby? Let's get ready to move out. 
 We gotta get there before dark. 
 (Music playing) 
 Dante : For the past and the future we serve. 
 All : We give thanks. 
 Dante : Good health, good food, and good company. 
 And the blessing of new friends. 
 All : We give thanks. 
 (Music playing) 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 (Music playing) 
 Abby. 
 Abby : Feed the... first. Everyone else can wait. 
 Was that your idea? 
 Yes, sir. 
 It's a good idea. 
 Have we heard from him? 
 No, sir. 
 Still radio silence. 
 Well, you're gonna brief me, then. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Mr. Chancellor. 
 Jaha : Sinclair, if you can hear me and can't respond. 
 It has been 12 hours since our last contact. 
 The air up here is holding up better than I am. 
 Time for me to face the fact that I can't help you anymore. 
 My job is done. 
 I am so tired. 
 Tell Kane and Abby... they're on their... they're on their own now. 
 As long as they work together, everything will be ok. 
 You remind them of that. 
 You tell them to keep our people safe. 
 Jaha out. 
 (Sigh) 
 (Static) 
 May we meet again. 
 (Powering down) 
 (Sigh) 
 (Baby crying) 
 (Crying continues)
