 Clarke  (V.O.): I was born in space. I've never felt the sun on my face or breathed real air or floated in the water. None of us have. For three generations, the Ark has kept what's left of the human race alive, but now our home is dying, and we are the last hope of mankind. A hundred prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground. Each of us is here because we broke the law. On the ground, there is no law. All we have to do is survive. But we will be tested, by the Earth, by the secrets it hides, and most of all, by each other. 
 Previously on the 100. 
 ( Gunshot ) 
 ( Explosion ) 
 Anya : You started a war that you don't know how to end. 
 Lincoln : You have no idea what your people have done, the forces you unleashed. 
 Octavia : We had to stop the attack. 
 Lincoln : You stopped nothing. 
 Murphy : We have to get out of here while we still have the chance. 
 Finn : I love you. 
 Raven : Not the way that I want to be loved, not the way that you love Clarke. It's over, Finn. 
 Sinclair : The dropship is still tied in to all of our major systems. If it launches, the Ark will be crippled, and everyone left on board will die. 
 Diana : Launch! 
 Bellamy : Your mom is early. 
 Clarke : Something is wrong. 
 End of intro. 
 Bellamy : First watch is over. Go relieve Monroe on the south wall. Keep your eyes open. Anything? 
 Clarke : It's been two days. Maybe the bomb at the bridge scared them off for good. 
 Bellamy : You believe that? 
 Clarke : No. They're coming. 
 Bellamy : Jasper thinks he can cook up some more gunpowder, if he gets some sulfur, and Raven says she can turn that into landminess. So be careful where you step. 
 Clarke : Ha! Funny. 
 Bellamy : What I really need is a thousand more of her tin can bombs I can roll into their village and blow those Grounders to hell. That's what they want to do to us. 
 Clarke : Can't believe we survived a hundred years just so we could slaughter each other. There has to be another way. Any word from the Ark? 
 Bellamy : Radio silence. Finally ran out of air. 
 Clarke : Maybe my mom was lucky being on the Exodus ship. At least it was quick. No one is coming down to save us. 
 
 Kane : Ah. Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? 
 
 Del : Let's get this party smoking. 
 Octavia : You don't want the fire too big. So maybe just try to knock it down with some wet leaves. 
 Del : You get that from your boyfriend, Grounder pounder? 
 Murphy : She's right. A hot fire is not gonna preserve the meat as well. 
 Del : You can't take the heat, get out of the smokehouse. Should be kissing our asses for being allowed back in this camp. 
 Murphy : Just keep working. Your brother couldn't get you a better job? Would think anything would be better than working in the meat furnace. 
 Octavia : Oh, probably. That just means someone else would have to do it. 
 
 Finn : What's for dinner? 
 Raven : Split loads, turning one bullet into two. It's all I can do until we get more gunpowder. Jasper has a recipe. Yesterday I saw him taking buckets from the latrine. I didn't ask. 
 Finn : Is one of those for me? 
 Raven : Maybe. Still deciding. 
 Finn : I keep wanting to apologize again. 
 Raven : You don't have to. We're good. I got to get this done. 
 Finn : That's bad. 
 Raven : What? 
 Finn : When you're really pissed off, you always find a project, something to keep your hands busy so you don't punch someone in the face. 
 Raven : I'm not keeping busy, Finn. I'm keeping us alive. 
 Finn : Yeah. You're right. That was a dumb thing to say. See you later. 
 Raven : Wait. We're good. We're good. We are. I just want you to be happy. 
 Male delinquent : Whoa! Guys! Fire! 
 Other male delinquent : Go, go, go! All right. 
 Raven : Come on. 
 Bellamy : Are you okay? 
 Octavia :  ( Coughs and nods in reply ) 
 Murphy : This is all your fault! We told you it was too much wood. 
 Del : Get the hell away from me. 
 Bellamy : Hey! Hey! Hey, stop! Save it for the Grounders. 
 Octavia : Well, now what the hell are we gonna do? That was all the food. 
 Clarke : Any idea what happened? 
 Bellamy : Murphy says that Del kept feeding the fire, mostly because Octavia told him it was a bad idea. 
 Clarke : And we believe Murphy? 
 Bellamy : I do. 
 Clarke : Yeah. We have some wild onions and nuts in the dropship. It's only enough to last us maybe one or two weeks. What's left here? 
 Bellamy : Nothing. It all burned. 
 Clarke : Then we have to hunt. Anyone we can spare goes out. The whole Grounder army out there? Look. We can't defend ourselves if we're starving. 
 
 Bellamy : Each group takes someone with a gun, and they're for killing Grounders, not food. We don't have the ammo. Use the spears for hunting. Get what you can. Be back by nightfall. No one stays out after dark. 
 Myles : Hey Clarke. You alone? You maybe want to go together? 
 Clarke : Sure. I'll get some gear. 
 Finn : You ready to go? 
 Clarke : I don't think so. 
 Finn : Come on. I'm a good tracker. You're lousy with a spear, but you're sneaky. We make a good team. 
 Myles : Hey, partner, we're wasting daylight. Oh, Finn, you're joining the band? 
 Finn : Sure. 
 Myles : Awesome. Haven't really got a chance to hang with you guys much. Hey, do you even know how I got arrested on the Ark? 
 Finn : I'm dying to hear about it. 
 
 Bellamy : We need more ammo. 
 Raven : That's it till Jasper gets back. Now get out of my tent. 
 Bellamy : Where you going? 
 Raven : The hell out of here. 
 Bellamy : No way. You're not leaving. 
 Raven : Really? And what makes you think you can tell me what to do? Aren't you a janitor? 
 Bellamy : Where you gonna go? 
 Raven : Into these damn woods. Don't worry about it. I'll find someplace safe. 
 Bellamy : Just wait. Don't be an idiot. You go alone, and you're dead or worse. 
 Raven : So what's your plan, sit here until you run out of bullets? 
 Bellamy : Yeah. Or until you come up with something better. Come on, Raven. You came down here in a pod you rebuilt yourself. You made a bomb out of a tin can. What else you got in that head of yours? 
 Raven : Radios. We can't defend ourselves if we can't communicate. If we can build radios, walkie-talkies- Then we can fight as a team. We'd have a chance, at least. 
 Bellamy : See? We need you. You may be a huge pain in the ass, but you're smart. 
 
 Kane : Anybody there? Hello? 
 Wick : Fifty-six bottles of beer on the wall - fifty-six bottles of beer - Hello? Take one down and pass it around - Fifty-five bottles of beer on the wall - fifty-five bottles of beer on the wall - Hello? - Fifty-five bottles of beer - take one down and pass it around - 
 Kane : Hey, hey, can you hear me? 
 Wick : What do you want? Councilor, sir? 
 Kane : It's Wick, isn't it, from engineering, Sinclair's apprentice? 
 Wick : Yeah, yeah. He had me come down here to override the containment codes to keep the doors open. Don't tell him I messed up. 
 Kane : Hey. You didn't mess up. We need to get your arm free. 
 Wick : Yeah. Let's do that. That sounds like a good idea. 
 Kane : Rrgh! Ah!  ( Panting )  Did you see anyone else around here? 
 Wick : No. Heard there was a hull breach in engineering. It was a breach? What the hell happened, anyway? 
 Kane : We were betrayed. Councilor Sydney, she took the Exodus ship by force. Damage to the Ark was catastrophic. 
 Wick : What a bitch. My mom voted for her. 
 Kane : I'm not gonna be able to open these doors without some help. I'll be right back. 
 Wick : You can't leave me, man. 
 Kane : I won't leave you here. 
 Wick : All right.  ( Clank as door opens )  Rrgh! Aagh! Dude! Aagh! Ah, my God, thank you. That was- Gr! Aah! - Easy. I can hear the pumps. 
 Kane : I think the vents are working up ahead. Let's go. If you survived, there could be others. 
 Wick : It's like a ghost ship. 
 
 Myles : One of those scaly panther things? 
 Finn : Boar. 
 Myles : Good, because that panther meat is nasty, but I could eat a whole boar by myself, no joke. You know what the best part is of the boar? It's gonna sound gross. 
 Clarke : Myles, quiet for a second. What is it? 
 Finn : These tracks. They're perfect. 
 Clarke : Too perfect. 
 Finn : We're the ones being hunted. 
 Clarke : I don't see anything. 
 ( Arrows fly and hit MYLES in the leg and chest ) 
 Myles : Aah! Ah. 
 Clarke : Myles. 
 Finn : Clarke, come on. We got to leave him. 
 ( A Grounder comes from behind a nearby tree and hits Clarke in the face with a club. Clarke falls to the ground ) 
 Clarke : Ah! 
 Finn : Clarke! No. 
 
 Kane : Here. Hey, how's the air in here? 
 Wick : Crappy. 
 Kane : I'm gonna check the next few compartments. 
 Wick : Whoa, hey, are you sure you want to do that? This ship took a lot of damage. You walk through the wrong door, you could be stepping out into space. 
 Kane : We need to keep moving. The air in here can turn bad at any time. 
 Wick : At least we're breathing. 
 Kane : The CO2 scrubbers down here have kicked back on. They can restart themselves? 
 Wick : No. The electrical fires blew out a DCDU. Everything is on manual. 
 Kane : Is it getting cooler in here? 
 Wick : I don't feel it. 
 Kane : Could someone restart the central cooling exchanges in this level? 
 Wick : No. That runs through the primary board. 
 Kane : Earth monitoring. We need to get these people moving now. 
 Wick : Move them where? 
 Kane : The cooling air is a message. See, I think there's someone alive in Earth monitoring. 
 Wick : The air is a message. 
 Kane : Yeah. 
 Wick : Okay. You have hypoxia, all right? So you're working with about ten percent of your brain. 
 Kane : We need to get them moving, now. I am not gonna let these people die here. 
 Wick : Yeah. 
 
 Finn : We walked for about three miles after crossing that creek, another two or so before we got to the road. 
 Clarke : I don't think it matters, Finn. They didn't blindfold us, which means they don't care what we saw. They're probably gonna kill us. Uh! What do you want from us? 
 Anya : Help her. If she dies, he dies. 
 
 Wick : Rest in peace, Earth monitoring. 
 Kane : Let's check passageway four. 
 Wick : No. We got a jammed pressure door between us and pass. four, and we can't get through here. It's game over, man. 
 Kane : I need to talk to whoever is in there. 
 Wick : 'Please" would be nice. Watch this. Aha. 
 Kane : Earth monitoring, do you read? 
 Jaha : We read you. Who is this? Where are you? 
 Kane : Sir, it's good to hear your voice. 
 Jaha : Of course it's you, Kane. You're too stubborn to die. 
 Kane : I could say the same for you. 
 Jaha : What is your situation? 
 Kane : We have about a dozen survivors. 
 Jaha : That's good work, Councilor. Sinclair is rerouting power and air to the mess hall. Lead your people there. 
 Kane : After we get you. 
 Jaha : No. A fire burned through most of our oxygen. We put it out, but we don't have very long. 
 Kane : No. A fire burned through. All access is blocked. 
 Jaha : We are reviving as many Ark citizens as we can befoer our oxygen runs out. 
 Kane : I won't leave you to die. 
 Jaha : As your Chancellor, I am ordering you to gather as many survivors as you can and lead them to the mess hall. Jaha out. 
 Kane : Lead them to the mess hall, and when you get there, organize a search station by station. Look for survivors. 
 Wick : Let's go to the mess hall. Come on. Hey, the Chancellor is right. We all got to get out of here. This whole deck is an electrical fire waiting to happen. 
 Kane : That's why you have to lead these people out of here please. 
 Wick : So, what, you're got to save everybody else but yourself? This is nuts. 
 Kane : No one else can die because of me. Go. Go. Get yourselves to safety.  ( Kane tries to get wreckage away but it's too heavy for him. Wick joins him but still too heavy. Some survivors help move the wreckage away. )  On three. 
 
 
 
 
 Anya : Her name is Tris. 
 Clarke : I can't do this. I don't have any equipment. 
 Anya : We'll provide you with what we can. 
 Clarke : Why do you think I can save her? 
 Finn : Lincoln told her. 
 Anya : Yes. Our healer is gone. There's nothing we can do for her. For his sake, I hope you can. 
 Finn : Clarke, you can do this. 
 Clarke : Wait. What happened to her? 
 Anya : She was on the bridge when your bomb exploded. You did this to her. 
 
 Monty : I found some good antenna wire for the radios. This guy was using it to fix his bed. 
 Raven : You find anything else from the Exodus ship wreckage? 
 Monty : Yeah, data log. Want to hear something weird?  ( Radio static ) 
 Raven : Sounds like interference. 
 Monty : Wait. It gets weirder. When the signal hit, their nav. system went nuts. They never got it back, and then boom. It's like something was jamming the signal. 
 Raven : That is weird. It also makes no sense whatsoever. 
 Monty : No. 
 Raven : Pull the drive-in speakers. 
 Monty : You want to strip it? We'll never find out where they crashed. 
 Raven : We need every component we can get our hands on if we're gonna make walkies and I need the radio. 
 Monty : No way. How are we supposed to contact the Ark? 
 Raven : The Ark is not there. You're listening to a hole in the sky. 
 Monty : My family is up there. 
 Raven : I'm sorry. The hunters are back? Is Finn with them? 
 Bellamy : I don't think so. Hey, relax. I'm sure Clarke is keeping him out of trouble. What are you doing in here? 
 Raven : They don't waste time. I'll get them that. What's it been, a day and a half? 
 Bellamy : Mistaken me for someone who cares. Time to move on. What are you doing? 
 Raven : Moving on. I've never been with anyone but Finn. Take off your clothes. 
 Bellamy : Fine. I'll go first. If you're looking for someone to talk you down, tell you that you're just upset and not thinking straight, I'm not that guy. 
 Raven : Good. 
 
 (Tris gasping and coughing) 
 Finn : She's getting worse. 
 Help me lift her up. 
 Oh, my God, here we go. 
 She's not moving any air on the left. 
 There's fluid pressing on her lungs. 
 I don't see an entry wound. 
 No. It wasn't shrapnel. It was trauma. 
 The force of the explosion, it hit her in the chest. 
 She's drowning in her own blood. 
 She can't breathe. I have to relieve the pressure. 
 I need a small tube, something rigid the size of my finger. 
 Here. 
 Thanks. 
 Fifth intercostal space. 
 Ah... Ah... 
 This better work. 
 You're ok. Attagirl. Breathe. 
 What have you done? 
 No. You don't understand. She couldn't breathe. 
 Uh! 
 Back off! 
 Huh! 
 Uh! 
 Everybody gets oxygen now. 
 Sir... 
 Sir, are you all right? 
 I gave you an order. 
 You're bound by law to follow. 
 The people in this room are our best chance to save the Ark. 
 Besides, a wise man once told me... 
 I needed to learn when not to follow the law. 
 Heh heh. A wise man. 
 Thank you. 
 So what do we do now? 
 She's breathing a little better, but even if we can save her, what happens then? 
 Then maybe we don't die today. 
 She's hot. 
 Her heart rate is way up. 
 She's probably septic. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means her blood is poisoned. 
 What about this stuff? 
 Caliban : That slows bleeding. 
 Coagulant. No. 
 Lincoln had that same stuff at the dropship. 
 I don't see any antibiotics. Maybe that lake seaweed? 
 She doesn't need seaweed. She needs real medicine. 
 How could you send a little girl into battle? 
 What is wrong with you people? 
 She was with me. She was my second. 
 It's how we train them to be warriors. 
 Oh, so the killing can just go on and on. 
 Clarke... 
 You put the bomb on the bridge. 
 You did this to her. 
 (Tris gasping) 
 She needs clean blood. 
 Transfusion? 
 Ok. There's no tubing. 
 So we need a syringe, the biggest one you can find, and I need a cannula. 
 It's like a hollow needle. 
 Did that help? 
 No. 
 Jaha : Any word yet on casualties? 
 No. 
 Sinclair still has teams out assessing the damage, but... whole stations may have been lost. 
 I estimate no more than 1,000 survivors... at least 1,500 dead. 
 Wick : Hey, guys, I found something. 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 Mr. Wick has trouble with protocol. 
 What did you find? 
 Data from the Exodus launch. 
 The monitor says that service hatch beta was manually sealed before the launch from our side. 
 There was someone in the service bay. 
 But there are survivors? 
 People jumped ship at the last moment? 
 Maybe Sydney threw them off. Maybe they were a threat. 
 Could they still be alive in the service bay? 
 Well, sir, if they hunkered down and got lucky, yeah, they could still be ticking, but they won't be for long. 
 Well, how do we get to them? 
 How can we get to them? 
 We could try the maintenance shaft. 
 It's sealed on both sides, so you'd have pressurization. 
 Sinclair : And it's pressed right up against the fuel pods. 
 Without power to the coolant system, it'll be hot as hell in there. 
 Kane : I have to try. 
 It's as sharp as it's gonna get. 
 All right. Thanks. 
 (Tris moaning) 
 Bleach. 
 Guess there's no moonshine. 
 Ok. I'm gonna need your blood. 
 No. 
 You're from the same tribe. 
 It's the best match we're gonna get. 
 Clarke, if you're gonna do something, you have to do it now. 
 Just use mine. 
 (Winces) 
 I can't find a vein. 
 She's clamping down. She's lost too much blood. 
 Clarke... 
 Oh, come on. 
 She's not breathing. 
 Take him away and kill him. 
 No. No. No. No! No. No. 
 I did everything I could. No! 
 Finn : Clarke, stop. They'll hurt you. 
 No. Get off. 
 No. 
 Wick : Hey... 
 You'll need this battery to open up the door to the bay. 
 Good? Yeah? 
 Uh! 
 Uh! 
 Ah... 
 It's not that hot. 
 Sinclair doesn't know what he's talking about. 
 It's a little warm. 
 So you're not gonna talk me out of going? 
 Nope. 
 When you die, can I have your shoes? 
 They're much too stylish for you. 
 Ah! 
 Uh... 
 (Panting) 
 Monty : You finished the walkies. 
 Hey... 
 I'm sorry about before, really, and about your family. 
 Thanks. 
 So all the hunters are back except Clarke and Finn. 
 Ok. 
 Raven, they were with another kid... Myles. 
 They all left camp together. 
 All 3 of them are still out there? 
 Yeah. We're going to look for them. 
 Bring the walkies. 
 Uh... 
 Aagh! Oh! 
 Oh... oh... 
 (Beep) 
 Come on. 
 Hey... hey, wake up. 
 Hey... 
 Abby? 
 Abby, wake up. 
 It's so hot. 
 Anya will take no pleasure in your friend's death. 
 Prove your worth, and you'll be welcome here. 
 I couldn't save Tris. Why would you want me? 
 We told you. Our healer is gone. 
 Will I be able to go back to see them... my friends, my home? 
 Tomorrow there'll be nothing to go back to. 
 Those marks on her shoulder, what were they? 
 Lincoln has them, too. 
 Each scar marks a kill in combat. 
 5 kills? 
 She was a little girl. 
 She was brave. 
 How many do you have? 
 That's a lot. 
 And half were after I hurt my knee. 
 Aagh! 
 Shh... 
 Shh shh shh shh... 
 Raven : Where are they? 
 We'll find them. 
 Monty, on radio : I thought you said you were heading west. 
 Where are you? 
 Bellamy, on radio : Just keep the moon on your left, and you'll find us. 
 Raven : This morning, all I could think about was how much easier this would all be if Finn was just... 
 Gone. 
 You didn't wish this into being, Raven. 
 Stop torturing yourself. 
 (Quivering signal) 
 Monty : Is anyone else hearing this signal? 
 Just keep your eyes open. 
 I think it's the same thing we heard in the black box. 
 Damn it, Monty, pay attention. 
 Do you see anything? 
 Report. 
 (Quivering signal) 
 Oh, my God. 
 (Screech) 
 (Static) 
 Uh... 
 There's someone in the bushes. 
 Myles? 
 Uh... 
 Myles, what happened? 
 Where are they? 
 Clarke and Finn, where are they? 
 Grounders took them. 
 Take it easy. 
 We have to get him back to camp. 
 Bell, what about Clarke and Finn? 
 Raven, I'm sorry. 
 We need to make a stretcher. 
 Monty, we're heading home. You copy? 
 Monty, can you hear me? 
 Monty... 
 Monty, where the hell are you? 
 Bellamy, on radio : Report. 
 Monty... 
 Aah! Aah!
