 Previously on The 100... 
 (All coughing) 
 Welcome to Mount Weather. 
 (People moaning) 
 Anya? 
 Ok, come on. 
 (Water rushing) 
 There has to be another way. 
 Anya : There isn't! 
 Thank you. 
 You killed 300 of my warriors. 
 I can't show my face without a prize. 
 The Grounders took them. 
 The guy with the one eye. 
 He's got Clarke's watch. 
 Where is the girl who was wearing this watch?! 
 (Gunshot) 
 Let's get moving. 
 Are we really going to do this? 
 Bring the Ark to the ground? 
 Jaha : Godspeed, my friends. 
 There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles. 
 We will meet again. 
 It's a missile. 
 Our ancestors used them to destroy the world. 
 We're gonna use one to get back to it. 
 (Wind blowing) 
 Clarke : Anya, we've been walking for hours. 
 Where are we going? 
 Quiet. 
 Why not just kill me and get it over with? 
 You can tell the commander what the Mountain Men are doing to us in there. 
 So let's work together. We don't have to be enemies. 
 And unite with someone as weak as you? 
 I have what I need. 
 Hey. 
 We both want the same thing. 
 Get down. 
 They found us. 
 (Distant shouting) 
 Run. 
 Bellamy : Everyone, eyes peeled. We're in Grounder territory. 
 Murphy : Everything is Grounder territory, all right? 
 I can't keep running, all right? 
 We don't even know if the guy Finn killed was telling the truth. 
 Keep moving. 
 We can give him a minute. 
 No, we can't. 
 You heard what that Grounder said. 
 "They'll outlive their usefulness." 
 I heard what he said when you had a gun to his head. 
 Look, you think I wanted to do that? 
 He would have told his people we're coming, and by the time we got there, our people would be dead. 
 Maybe that's something you can live with, but I can't! 
 Hey, you did what you think you had to do, but you are not yourself right now, and I can't be out here with another loose cannon. 
 Guys. 
 (Flies buzzing) 
 Fall in. 
 Where the hell did they come from? 
 From the Ark. 
 (Buzzing continues) 
 It's a rough landing. 
 (Birds chirping) 
 There's nothing we can do for these people. 
 We got to go. 
 (Distant woman whimpering) 
 Did you hear that? 
 Hey. Hey, someone's down there. 
 Hey! 
 Woman : Please! 
 Up here! 
 Please, help me! 
 Mel? 
 Help me! 
 You know her? 
 Shut up, Murphy. 
 She's my friend. We have to do something. 
 Help me! 
 Mel : Sterling, please! 
 We can't stop. 
 This isn't a Grounder, Finn. 
 We have a rope. 
 You saw her. 
 She'd never be able to hold on to it. 
 We'd have to lower somebody down. 
 It'll take time that we don't have. 
 I hate this as much as you... 
 I know. 
 I... I know. Ok, I know. 
 Sterling : Just hold on! 
 Just hold on, Mel. 
 Mel : Sterling! 
 We'll come back for her. 
 Ok? 
 Mel : Please! 
 We're movin' out. 
 Finn : Wait! Sterling! 
 Hey! 
 Mel : I can't hang on! 
 Murphy : Well, it looks like we're taking that break after all, huh? 
 Man, on radio : Be advised, the fence is live. 
 Copy that. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, the fence is hot. 
 (People cheer)  Trust me, you do not want to go near it. 
 (Overlapping chatter) 
 Man : Careful. 
 (Girl outside shrieks) 
 (Grunting) 
 Reyes, there you are. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Dr. Griffin cleared you for work. How's your leg? 
 It's not a factor. 
 What's the job? 
 Need you to build a radio beacon. 
 If the other Ark stations have survivors, we need to know it. 
 I'm on it.  (Sighs) 
 I got it. 
 Ok, report to engineering and we'll get you started. 
 Roger that. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Drein daun. 
 Drein daun. 
 I'm sorry. I don't understand. 
 Hey. 
 Wait, just a se... 
 Ah. 
 Mmm. Ah. 
 (Coughs) 
 (Sighs) 
 Thank you. 
 What's your name? 
 Your name. You. 
 Zoran. 
 Zoran. 
 Good name. 
 I'm Thelonious. 
 Thuh-lawn-us. 
 Yeah. 
 Thee-lo-noose. 
 Jaha : Please, I mean you no harm. 
 Strangers are not welcome here. 
 Please! I'm injured! Please! 
 (Groans) 
 (Twig snaps) 
 Quiet. 
 You can't even walk in the woods. 
 If I'm such a burden, then cut me loose. 
 Heavy footfalls, broken branches. 
 You even smell like them. 
 (Distant men chattering) 
 Down. 
 No. Not to drink. 
 Then why stop? We should be running. 
 You reek. 
 Cover yourself in it. 
 (Panting) 
 I'm almost there! 
 Once I have her, pull us up! 
 Well, I'd say he's heard one too many of your motivational speeches. 
 Shut up, Murphy. 
 Give me your hand. It's ok, Mel. 
 Ok. 
 I got you. All right. Ok. 
 I got you... 
 (screaming) 
 All righty. 
 (Whimpers) 
 I got you, ok? Give me your hand. 
 (Crying) 
 You'll be all right. I got you. 
 (Screams) 
 Bellamy : Sterling! Sterling! 
 Sterling : Aah... 
 Mel! Mel, hold on. 
 (Crying) 
 Focus on me. 
 You can do this. 
 Oh, no! 
 Yes, you can. You're strong. 
 I'm not strong! 
 Stubborn, maybe. 
 So be stubborn a little longer. 
 I'm not gonna let you die, you hear me? 
 (Crying)  Ok. 
 We're out of rope. 
 So we make a new one. 
 If anything happens to our friends, when we could... 
 We don't know if we could save our friends. 
 For all we know, they may be dead already. 
 We've all thought it. 
 But what we do know is we could save this one girl. 
 Sterling was one of us. 
 She was his friend. 
 I'm in. 
 (Mel crying) 
 How do we do it? 
 Bellamy : We make new rope from the wreckage. 
 Go find wires, seatbelts, anything. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 I hope you're right about this. 
 So do I. 
 (Wind blowing) 
 You said I wasn't welcome here. 
 Zoran's father thought I should let you stay. 
 Then I should thank him. 
 He is gathering supplies. 
 (Groans) 
 You speak English. 
 I was aiming for the eastern United States. Did I make it? 
 This is the dead zone, on the way to the city of light. 
 I am Sienna. 
 You must eat, then rest. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Grunting) 
 Good. 
 Mmm! Thank you. 
 Is the city of light your home? 
 It will be, if we can find it. 
 Oh, God. 
 Zoran! 
 I... I'm sorry. He surprised me. 
 We're used to the hatred. 
 I have no room for hate. 
 What happened to him? 
 He was born that way. 
 It happens sometimes. 
 Radiation. 
 Fate. 
 When such a child is born, we leave it out, let nature reclaim it, to erase the stain from the bloodline. 
 How could you do that? 
 That is our way. 
 I knew what was expected of me. 
 I could not give up my child. 
 We left our home so that he might live. 
 You chose to leave your people? 
 He is my son. 
 
 
 
 (Overlapping chatter) 
 (Music playing) 
 (Voice distorted by helium)  What the hell are you doing in here, wrench monkey? 
 Helium, Wick? Really? 
 Ark welders aren't toys. 
 (Normal voice)  Come on, Reyes. You got to enjoy life. 
 You enjoy enough for everybody. 
 So, still dreaming up designs the rest of us will have to fix? 
 Hey, my designs are elegant. 
 If only they were realistic. 
 (Scoffs) 
 Well, it's been real, but I have a beacon to work on. 
 In that case, welcome to my party. 
 Schematics are over here on the bench. 
 You already designed it? 
 Yep... We're using parts we salvaged from the station's debris field. 
 Obviously. 
 Oh, also, I have a little something for you. 
 What a piece of crap. 
 You're welcome? 
 I can get around just fine. 
 What you need to worry about is countering the mountain effect. 
 That's your job. 
 (Sighs)  Damn engineers. 
 Damn mechanics. 
 (Both panting) 
 (Distant men chattering) 
 How are they still following us? 
 Because of you. 
 Time to end this. 
 Anya, I am stepping where you step. 
 I'm covered in mud. We're not leaving a trail. 
 Anya : They're following something. 
 They're not following us. 
 They're tracking us. 
 Search yourself. 
 If I'm right, it should feel like a... a small bump just under your skin. 
 Oh. 
 It's you. 
 Ok, I could remove it, but you need to untie my hands. 
 I just need something sharp and sterile. 
 (Groans)  Aah! 
 (Spits) 
 (Panting) 
 I will not go back there. 
 All right. Ease it out slowly. 
 (Bellamy grunting) 
 Just hang on. 
 I'm almost there. 
 It's ok. I got you. I got you. 
 Just put your arms around me. 
 I can't. 
 Yes, you can. 
 It's ok. This will hold. 
 I'll get you up. I promise. 
 Ok? 
 Ok. Ok. 
 (Whimpering) 
 (Grunts) 
 I got her! Pull us up! 
 Don't you worry, Bellamy. I won't drop you. 
 Just pull, Murphy. 
 Raven : Hey. 
 I'm changing the tone frequency to 400 hertz. 
 It'll increase the radiated modulation depth. 
 Atmospheric noise will screw us. So the signal's fainter. 
 At least they'll know we're out here. 
 (Sighs) 
 What's wrong? 
 The current is not getting high enough. 
 We might as well be shouting into the wind. 
 We put an insulator between the mast and capacity top hat. 
 Already tried that. Not working. 
 Then you're doing it wrong. 
 Raven. 
 Don't worry. I'll fix it. 
 I always do. 
 Try my damn brace! 
 Your damn brace sucks! 
 Come on, Raven. Elbow grease ain't gonna fix this. 
 What would you know about elbow grease? 
 (Grunting) 
 (Panting) 
 Wick : Hey, come on. 
 Let's go back to the work room. We'll think it through. 
 Leave me alone, Wick! 
 Rrr! 
 (Bellamy and Mel grunting) 
 Pull, Murphy! 
 Murphy : Aah! 
 (Screaming) 
 Come on! A little help! 
 Oh, no! Pull! Pull! 
 What the hell is happening up there?! 
 Just hold on! 
 Grounders! 
 Cover! 
 Bellamy : How many are there? 
 We can't see 'em! In the trees! 
 In the trees! Aim for the trees! 
 Aah! No, no, no! 
 Just hang on. 
 Aah! 
 We're gonna need to cut her loose. We can't do this. 
 Murphy : Bellamy, you got to cut her loose! 
 No way! 
 Cut her loose! 
 (Monroe groaning) 
 (Foghorn blowing) 
 Acid fog. 
 Monroe, get back on the rope! 
 Murphy : Come on! 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 We have to take cover from the fog. 
 Octavia : Bellamy. 
 No, we don't. 
 Murphy : She blew the horn. 
 (Breathlessly)  Octavia. 
 (Country music playing) 
 Wick : Bring me down, Reyes. 
 Hey, you know why you're working on the beacon? 
 I'm not. 
 Find someone else. 
 Because I asked for you. 
 You're the best mechanic we got. 
 Go, me. Exactly 3 mechanics made it to the ground. 
 You were top-3 on the Ark, too. 
 I say this even though you refuse to acknowledge the ingenuity of my designs. 
 Stop. 
 Or insanity. 
 Listen, you have a first-rate mind. 
 You do. Use it. 
 Your leg's messed up, and that blows. 
 Figure out a way to work around it. 
 (Whispers)  How do I do that? 
 You could let your friends help, for one. 
 The rest, it's up to you. 
 (Sighs) 
 What do you know? 
 It holds. 
 Barely. 
 Oh, whatever! My design worked! You can admit it! 
 Whatever. This thing's an offense to mechanics everywhere. 
 (On helium)  You're welcome. 
 Helium. 
 Argon! 
 (Normal voice)  What? Are we not just tossing out noble gases? 
 No, you idiot! 
 I know what we have to do to raise the beacon. 
 Zoran. 
 Zoran, please. Come on. 
 Jaha : Come on. Please. 
 And you don't... you don't need this for me. 
 I have something for you. 
 What is it? 
 So you do speak English. 
 Not to strangers. 
 It's all right. 
 Heh! 
 Well, we're not strangers anymore. 
 It's called a chess piece. 
 The black knight. 
 The game teaches long-term strategy. 
 Taught my son how to play when he was about your age. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Sienna : Where is your son now? 
 Dead. 
 I chose different from you. 
 I put my people first. 
 Your people must be very important to you. 
 So was my son. 
 Anya, you're still bleeding. 
 At least let me bandage it before it gets infected. 
 Clarke : I can find my way home from here. 
 Looks like you're my prisoner now. 
 You must go! 
 Quick! 
 (Grunts)  Come with me! Come with me! 
 (Panting) 
 There. 
 (Distant horse neighs softly) 
 Look at the ridge. 
 (Horse whinnies) 
 Who are they? 
 Bad men. 
 They're coming for you. 
 No one comes to the dead zone. 
 They must have seen you fall from the sky. 
 You have to run, now. 
 If they expect to find me, what happens to you if they don't? 
 Go! 
 Go before they see you. We can take care of ourselves. 
 (Horse whinnies) 
 (Monroe winces, sighs) 
 Thank God you came when you did. 
 I was going back to camp when I heard shots. 
 Murphy : Nice foghorn. What happened to your boyfriend? 
 He's gone. 
 Murphy : All right. 
 Hey. 
 I'm sorry, O. 
 The Grounders will be back, so we need to go, now. 
 Finn : Yes, we do. 
 Bellamy : Octavia says the arrow might be poisoned. 
 I have to take them home. 
 I know. 
 I'll meet you as soon as I can. 
 I know. 
 Murphy : Parting, such sweet sorrow, right? 
 Where the hell do you think you're going? 
 Come on. 
 Bellamy, you know if I go with you, they'll just lock me up again. 
 Really? 
 Watch his back. 
 I can't get them home without you. 
 Of course you can't. 
 Let's go. 
 (Clarke panting) 
 Anya, wait. 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Hey... 
 Aah! 
 I don't want to kill you, Anya. 
 Then you're the one that's gonna die. 
 (Both grunting) 
 Aah! 
 (Both panting) 
 You fought well. 
 Do you see that? 
 I knew it. 
 He lied. 
 My people are out there. 
 (Overlapping chatter) 
 So the balloon beacon wasn't a bad idea. 
 I think the word you're searching for is "genius." 
 You should have been an engineer. 
 You already have the arrogance. 
 Oh, that's what they teach you. I wondered. 
 Sinclair : Well, that's one way to do it. 
 Byrne : What the hell are you doing? 
 Oh, it's a radio beacon. 
 Wrong. It's a target. 
 Raven : Hey, wait a second! 
 (Gunshot echoes) 
 Wick : We fell from space in a football stadium; I think they already know we're here. 
 Chancellor Kane's out risking his life to negotiate with the Grounders. 
 You better hope he's successful, because if he isn't, every Grounder within 50 miles of here now knows exactly where we are! 
 I expected better, Chief. 
 All guards to the wall, now! 
 You see a Grounder, you're authorized to shoot on sight! 
 Man : Yes, ma'am. 
 Byrne : Let's go! 
 Cover the perimeter! Move! 
 (Distant horse whinnies) 
 Zoran : He won't run! Please! They'll hurt him! 
 If he runs, they'll hurt us. 
 Father? 
 He brought the bad man here? 
 Mother, why are you doing this? 
 It's ok, Zoran. Listen to your mother. 
 (Crying)  You can still run! 
 Please! 
 If I do, that man will hurt your family, and I won't let that happen. 
 (Sobbing) 
 There is a bounty on sky people. 
 "Sky people"? 
 We needed the horse to reach the city of light. 
 (Horse whinnies) 
 Yeah. To survive, we do what we must. 
 I hope you find your new home. 
 (Zoran sobbing) 
 (Sniffling) 
 (Distant horse whinnies) 
 (Distant, overlapping chatter) 
 (Both panting) 
 Clarke : Look at that. 
 How many are there? 
 I don't know. 
 A lot, I hope. 
 I'm letting you go. 
 I'm not weak, but I'm not like you. 
 Our only chance against Mount Weather is if we fight together. 
 To beat them, we'll need our technology and your knowledge of this world. 
 I know my people will help. 
 The question is, will yours? 
 The commander was my second. 
 I can get an audience. 
 Please hurry. 
 (Distant gunshot) 
 Aah! 
 Anya! 
 (Gunshot) 
 Aah! 
 Hey. Hey, hey, hey. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 No, no. Hey. It's ok. No. 
 No, no, no. 
 Anya, you're ok. You're ok. 
 Aah! 
 Man : Shot two more. 
 Alpha team's got two Grounders down.
