 Previously on "The 100"... 
 Man : Before the last war, Mount Weather was a military base built within a mountain. 
 Man : Welcome to Mount Weather. 
 You're not prisoners. We saved you. 
 Then why would we want to leave? 
 This place is too good to be true. 
 Reapers! 
 (Reapers shouting) 
 Man : Octavia! 
 Octavia : Where's Lincoln? 
 Mark this one for the Cerberus program. 
 Octavia : They'll kill him. We have to do something. 
 Our friends are out there and you need to go get them. 
 Where is the girl who was wearing this watch?! 
 Let's get moving. 
 We'll search high and low for the kids. 
 I'm leading a mission to bring them back. 
 I'm taking the Grounder prisoner with me to guide the way. 
 I'm gonna get you out of here. 
 Clarke : Our only chance is if we fight together. 
 I know my people will help. 
 (Shot) 
 Aah! 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 Aah! 
 Man : Move, move, move! 
 Second man : Prisoner in custody. 
 Weapons... 
 (Shouting indistinctly) 
 Byrne : Secure the perimeter! Teams of 3! 
 100-yard buffer! 
 Open the gate! 
 How many of you are there? 
 Byrne : Let's go! 
 Man : We gotta get her to medical. Move! Move! 
 Wait. 
 Once the prisoner is secured. 
 She's not a prisoner. She's my daughter. 
 Clarke. 
 Mom? 
 I need saline and a pressure dressing. 
 I'm on it. 
 Ok, honey. 
 I saw your ship crash. 
 I wasn't on it. I'm right here. 
 Uhh. 
 Is she all right? 
 She will be. 
 I'm sorry, ma'am. 
 We had no idea who she was. 
 Where have you been? 
 Byrne... 
 Mount Weather. 
 The Grounders took you to Mount Weather? 
 No. The Mountain Men. 
 We have to get them out. 
 We're not doing this right now. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Clarke. Mom. 
 Did anyone else make it here? 
 Yes. 6 of you did. 
 Finn and Bellamy? 
 I thought they were dead. 
 I thought you were dead. 
 (Crying) 
 I thought you were dead. 
 Not me. 
 I'm right here. 
 (Beeping) 
 Thank you for coming. 
 I've been told you visit medical 3 or 4 times a day asking about Clarke. 
 Yeah. No one will let me see her. 
 That's because she's no longer here. 
 Clarke ran away. 
 I tried to convince her that she was safe here, but she couldn't stop looking for enemies when she was among friends. 
 I'm sorry. I don't mean to be disrespectful but.. 
 Clarke wouldn't just abandon us. 
 I wish it wasn't the case. 
 Why? Are you looking for her? 
 I can't risk the lives of my people to bring back someone who doesn't want to be here. 
 I hope you can understand that. 
 Yeah. 
 What I can do is let you go after her yourself. 
 Could I come back? 
 Of course you can. 
 Jasper, this is your home now. 
 You're welcome to stay here as long as you like. 
 Let me know what you decide. 
 Until our final journey to the ground. 
 Sir. Prisoner's refusing water. 
 If you don't drink, you'll die. 
 And if you die, you won't be able to help me stop the killing. 
 What makes you think he wants to stop the killing? 
 I have to believe they didn't survive down here all this time by fighting... 
 When there was a better way. 
 Come on. 
 Sorry about the rope. 
 Kane : At least we know he can talk. 
 I wish I could. 
 I knew it. He doesn't understand a word we're saying. 
 Kane : It's a tactic. 
 If we think he doesn't speak English, we won't expect him to tell us anything. 
 Due respect sir, then why do we expect him to lead us to his commander and not into a trap? 
 We don't. 
 And that's the beauty of it. 
 Whether he wants to kill us or help us make peace, either way... it's in his best interest to take us to his camp. 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 I thought you got thrown off the council. 
 Oh. It's the chancellor's pin. 
 Wait, you? 
 Yeah. 
 Thelonious didn't make it, and Kane left two days ago to try to make peace with the Grounders to get you and the others back. 
 I told you. The Grounders don't have us. 
 How long have I been asleep? 
 About 10 hours. 
 Ugh. 
 Oh, hey, Clarke, slow down. Hey. 
 It's too soon. 
 Mom, we need to move against Mount Weather. 
 How many guards are here? 
 Where are Finn and Bellamy? 
 Clarke, please. You need to rest. 
 I don't need to rest. I'm fine. 
 And I don't need you to protect me. 
 What I need is to save my friends. 
 Byrne : Ma'am. 
 Movement in the north woods. 
 Grounders? 
 I don't think so. 
 Hi. 
 I've been waiting out here all night. 
 Abby said you needed sleep. 
 Raven, I... 
 Sucks, but I'm dealing with it. 
 Woman : Open the gate. 
 (Buzzing) 
 Man : Weapon. 
 Need your weapon. 
 Weapon secure. 
 Bellamy. 
 Go. I'll catch up. 
 Ok. 
 I know you. Factory station. 
 Where are the others? 
 There are no others. 
 Found her a day from here. 
 No survivors. Lots of supplies. 
 Get her to medical. 
 Now, there's something I thought I'd never see. 
 I'm glad you're ok. 
 You, too. 
 How many are with you? 
 None. 
 Where's Finn? 
 Looking for you. 
 (Thunder) 
 I count 26. 
 I got 28. 
 These people don't look like warriors, Finn. 
 And there's kids. Old people. 
 There's nothing big enough here to hold our friends. 
 They could be underground. 
 We wait till dark. Then we go in. 
 We go in? 
 Finn, we don't even know if our people are here yet. 
 They're here. 
 Or they were when that Grounder took Clarke's watch. 
 What if we're too late, huh? 
 They're probably already dead. We need to... 
 Take it easy. 
 How much ammo do we have? 
 I think I liked you better as a peacemaker. 
 (Door creaks) 
 I see why Tsing chose you. 
 (Groaning) 
 Don't worry. The first dose is the worst. 
 (Groaning) 
 Byrne : We know nothing about these people in Mount Weather. 
 Their numbers, their capabilities. 
 We need to proceed carefully. 
 According to Clarke, the 47 still inside are not being harmed, at least not yet. 
 Now, I hate to leave them there, but if she's right, we have some time. 
 Ok. We gather intel on Mount Weather and we send a team after Kane. 
 He needs to know that the Grounders don't have those kids. 
 What about Finn Collins and John Murphy? 
 What? No. 
 You can't just cut them loose. 
 Abby : Sweetheart, we don't have the manpower to send out two separate rescue missions and protect our camp. 
 Mom. They're in trouble. 
 They're either gonna get themselves killed or they're gonna make things worse with the Grounders, who we need to get our people out of Mount Weather. 
 I know you feel this is unfair. 
 But our priority has to be with chancellor Kane if there is any hope for peace. 
 If you wanted peace, you shouldn't have killed the only Grounder who was gonna help us. 
 I'm sorry. 
 The decision's been made. 
 You're sorry? 
 Finn and Murphy are out there looking for your daughter with guns you gave us, and now she's home, you're just going to abandon them? 
 If you can't spare the guards, we know the terrain, we have a map. 
 We can do it ourselves. 
 Absolutely not. 
 Mom. 
 I just got you back. 
 Abby. 
 I'm sorry. We need you in medical. 
 You better go. 
 Byrne? 
 No one leaves this camp. 
 Byrne : Yes, ma'am. 
 We're gonna need guns. 
 I scored you a couple extra clips. 
 Hey. My mom's in surgery and the team going after Kane just left. 
 We should, too. 
 Did you find Octavia? 
 No. I found you. 
 I'm not letting you leave here without me. 
 Octavia... 
 Finn and Murphy are headed for Lincoln's village. 
 I've been there. Have you? 
 Has she? 
 You done? 
 What's this? 
 Your pack. 
 Lead the way. 
 Whoa. Not so fast, Pocahontas. 
 (Electricity crackles) 
 I thought you said it was handled. 
 It is. 
 Raven : Shut her down, Wick. 
 (Beeping) 
 Handled. 
 And you believe him? 
 Yes, I believe him. Clarke left us, Monty. 
 She faked being crazy to get into medical and she took off. 
 We need to go after her. 
 (Thump) 
 
 
 
 Where you going? 
 The dropship for starters. 
 I just heard. You're leaving? 
 Yes. We are. 
 No. We're not. 
 What would Clarke do? 
 No, you can't. It's too dangerous. 
 Don't worry. I'm a coward. 
 You're not. You're smart. 
 You can't make her come back. 
 Monty's right. She'd go after me. 
 But why am I so scared to do the same thing? 
 Whoa. What... ? 
 Radiation. 
 There's a containment breach. 
 But how? 
 I don't know! Ah! 
 What do we do? 
 No! 
 No! 
 (Crying) 
 Help! Help! 
 Someone help! 
 Help! 
 Somebody help! 
 Woman : Temperature's 104 and rising. 
 Blood pressure 180 over 120. 
 Blister coverage now 75%. 
 Standard treatment isn't working. 
 Wait. What does that mean? 
 Is there a non-standard treatment? 
 There is one thing we could try. 
 Then what are you waiting for?! 
 It's... unorthodox. 
 Because you were raised in space, your circulatory systems developed the ability to filter radiation out of your blood. 
 Now it's just a theory, but if we were to circulate Maya's blood through your system... 
 I could make her better. 
 What happens to him? 
 I'm not sure. 
 I know that look. Don't even think about it. 
 It's too dangerous. 
 I'm in. 
 (Crickets chirping) 
 Last time I saw you, you were closing the dropship door. 
 Had to be done. 
 Did you get any sleep? 
 It's ok. I'll sleep when we find Finn. 
 You haven't seen him, Clarke. 
 Losing you, the others, the war, it changed him. 
 He executed the Grounder that drew us the map. 
 Pulled the trigger without even blinking and walked away. 
 That doesn't sound like Finn. 
 No, it doesn't. 
 I saw what he was capable of, and still I let him go with Murphy and 2 automatic rifles. 
 I'm sure that had to be done, too. 
 When we got back to the dropship and no one was there, we assumed it was the Grounders. 
 Of course, you did. 
 You couldn't have known it was the Mountain Men. 
 No one could have. 
 How long until chocolate cake turns into being hung upside down and drained for their blood? 
 I don't know, but we don't have much time. 
 Ok. First we find Finn, then our people in Mount Weather. 
 Octavia : And Lincoln. 
 Think we've slept long enough. 
 What are you doing? This wasn't part of your plan. 
 We're changing the plan. 
 This is their food. 
 (Bell clanging) 
 (People shouting indistinctly) 
 Distraction? Not bad. 
 Let's go. 
 We need to run! 
 Can't. They'll kill our people. 
 They'll kill us! 
 (Gunfire) 
 (Screaming) 
 Who's in charge here?! 
 I'll ask again. Who's in charge? 
 Our leader isn't here. You can deal with me. 
 Nobody has to get hurt. We just want our people back. 
 We don't have your people. 
 Then you won't mind if we look around. 
 (Breathing hard) 
 You see? I told you it got better. 
 Your body's already craving it. 
 (Growling) 
 (Buzzing) 
 Now. 
 (Groaning) 
 15 seconds. 
 That's almost a record. 
 This one's a thoroughbred. 
 Up his dosage. Shock treatments every 2 hours. 
 When he fears the tone, we move to phase 2. 
 (Machine beeping) 
 You sure about this? 
 Look at her. I know you like her, but her blood is about to go into your body. 
 (Rapid beeping) 
 What is it?! 
 What's happening?! 
 We need to do this now. 
 Jasper. 
 I can't just let her die! 
 Let's do this. 
 This will sting a little. 
 Ow! A little?! 
 What is it? What's wrong? 
 Nothing. I feel nice. 
 Maya's been heavily sedated. 
 You will, of course, feel that, too. 
 It's perfectly normal. 
 If you've never done this before, how do you know? 
 You're right. I should have said: It's to be expected. 
 This will take a while. Why don't you head back to your room? 
 I'll send for you once he's awake. 
 Did you know about this? 
 No. 
 Sure. Have a seat. 
 Tell me where they went and you won't be in trouble. 
 Abby, I... 
 Someone let them through the fence. 
 Someone gave them guns. 
 I don't know what you're talk... 
 (slap) 
 (People murmuring indistinctly) 
 Ohh... 
 She thinks that because of what she's been through she's changed, but she's still just a kid. 
 You're wrong, Abby. 
 She stopped being a kid the day you sent her down here to die. 
 Stay sharp! 
 Yes, sir. 
 (Throws weapon on ground) 
 Sir, that's a bad idea. 
 This is as far as you go. 
 Sir? 
 If I'm wrong about this, only one of us has to die. 
 Go home. That's an order. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Let's go. 
 Your knife, too. 
 Let this be the first step toward peace. 
 (Knife clatters to ground) 
 (Men talking indistinctly) 
 Uhh! 
 Aahh... 
 (Door clangs shut) 
 (Breathing heavily) 
 (Rustling) 
 (Footsteps) 
 So we meet again. 
 I told you, we don't have your people. 
 Stop talking. 
 Murphy : Find something? 
 Finn! 
 Finn, answer me! Are you all right? 
 Hey, on your knees! On your knees, now! 
 On your knees! 
 Finn! 
 Murphy : Slow down. 
 What have you done with them? 
 Hey, Finn, Finn! Come on! 
 Their clothes are here! 
 They were here! 
 Finn! 
 You killed them! 
 Your friends were not here. 
 I saw one, Octavia. She was alone. 
 These people are scavengers, Finn. 
 They could've just found that stuff. 
 (Screaming) 
 Hey, Finn, stop! Stop! Look at me. 
 Get off me! 
 Finn, don't do this. 
 Let's just walk out of here while we still can, ok? 
 Finn. 
 Please. 
 This is it. 
 Which way to the village? 
 O? 
 The Reapers came from there. 
 I couldn't save him, Bell. 
 I couldn't save him. 
 (High-pitched tone) 
 Phase one's complete. 
 Start phase two. 
 One dose. 
 (Muffled talking) 
 Who wants it more? 
 (Muffled yelling) 
 (High-pitched tone) 
 (Grunting) 
 (Grunting) 
 (Screaming) 
 Welcome back. 
 What happened? 
 Containment breach in the dorm. 
 No one's ever been as sick as you and come back. 
 How do you feel? 
 I feel... great. 
 How is that possible? 
 Jasper saved your life, Maya. 
 Hey... 
 Can we speak with you outside, please? 
 I told you you were brave. 
 Tsing : It was an emergency. 
 We couldn't reach you in time. 
 Cage : You expect us to believe that? 
 Sir, I apologize for going around you, but it worked. 
 How is the patient? 
 Her recovery is miraculous. 
 I was referring to Jasper. 
 He'll recover, as I assured you he would. 
 That's not the point. 
 You disobeyed a direct order from the president not to experiment on those kids. 
 Mr. President, why bring them here if not to use them? 
 That's none of your concern. 
 Shouldn't you be in the dungeon with your monsters? 
 They're not monsters. They are soldiers. 
 And the reason why you get to play doctor in your ivory tower. 
 That's enough. Both of you. 
 We all have jobs to do. 
 Mine is to be obeyed. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Can I just say... the first human trial was a success. 
 After what we saw tonight, in my opinion, we have no choice but to move ahead with the forty-seven. 
 That'll be all, Dr. Tsing. 
 Tell me about the radiation leak. 
 The air filtration system malfunctioned, but the containment system worked. 
 Malfunctioned? 
 I'll look into it. 
 Now go paint, dad. 
 I'm your head of security. I'll clean this up. 
 You have a big decision to make. 
 What would you do? 
 Me? 
 I'd use them. 
 Just like that? 
 Our people come first, right? 
 Look, just because their clothes are here, doesn't mean anything. 
 He told us our friends were here. Why would he do that? 
 The guy with one eye? 
 Maybe because you had a gun to his head, Finn. 
 The man with one eye. 
 You saw Delano. 
 A snake. A thief. 
 He and his men were cast out. 
 You are his revenge. 
 It makes sense. 
 Finn. Ok, we need to go. 
 Now. Now! We need to go! 
 No! 
 (Shouting) 
 (Crowd groaning) 
 He was just trying to get away! 
 Come on. 
 Finn! 
 Finn! We need to go! 
 Look at me! We need to go now! 
 Finn! Stop! 
 Finn! 
 Finn! 
 Finn! 
 Finn, come on! We need to go! 
 (Whispering)  Artigas. 
 I found you.
