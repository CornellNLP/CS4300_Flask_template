 Previously on "The 100"... 
 You're being sent to the ground. 
 Before the last war, Mount Weather was a military base built within a mountain. 
 No one ever made it there. 
 Dante : Welcome to Mount Weather. 
 You're not prisoners. 
 We saved you. 
 Why would we want to leave? 
 We have friends out there who need our help. 
 Clarke, no! 
 If you pull that lever, these people will die. 
 Even a little radiation could kill them. 
 Are we really gonna do this, bring the Ark to the ground? 
 Tell me what it's like. 
 Everything I dreamed. 
 Thelonious, you should be here. 
 My job is done. Jaha out. 
 (Baby cries) 
 I thought you died. 
 You brought me to your village? 
 They'll kill you. 
 You son of a bitch! 
 Unh! 
 You are not in control here anymore. 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 (Tool whirring) 
 Open it up. 
 Yes, sir. 
 How long are you gonna keep me locked up in here? 
 Until I'm confident you're no longer a threat to others. 
 Let's continue. 
 Now you said there were hundreds of Grounders attacking. 
 200, 300? 
 I didn't count. 
 Why do you think they attacked? 
 What provoked them? 
 We were here. That was enough. 
 We're wasting time. 
 The others didn't just vanish into thin air. 
 They were taken, and we need to go after them. 
 Search team is prepping to leave but not before we've gotten the intel we need from you. 
 I need to be on that team, please. 
 That's out of the question. 
 You're not trained. 
 It's too dangerous. 
 Those are my people out there. 
 They're my people, too. 
 You want to help them? 
 Tell me what we're up against... 
 Grounder tactics, their numbers, what kind of weapons they used. 
 Arrows and spears, axes, swords, their teeth. 
 No guns? 
 You had guns. 
 The guns we found at the aid depot leveled the playing field, and maybe, maybe if we'd had more bullets, we could have... 
 There were more bullets. 
 Search team just returned from the bunker. 
 They found two more barrels full of rifles and a third filled with bullets. 
 We should have looked harder. 
 (Door opens) 
 Man : Keep walking. 
 What's he doing here? 
 Excuse me, sir. Dr. Griffin cleared Mr. Murphy out of medical. 
 Put him over there, Major Byrne. 
 On your knees. 
 Come on. 
 Well, this should be fun. 
 (Gunshots) 
 Let's go! 
 Move, move, move! 
 Go, go, go! 
 There! They were right there! 
 Did anyone see anything? 
 Who was there? How many? 
 What did they look like? 
 I don't know, but I'm sure I saw someone move. 
 You opened fire? 
 That could have been the kids. 
 Abby! 
 No. 
 We'll sweep the woods. 
 In the meantime, who issued you that weapon? 
 I did, sir. 
 From now on, only members of the guard get guns. 
 Unauthorized use of firearms will be punishable as a felony under the Exodus Charter. 
 Is that clear? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Marcus, search the damn woods. 
 Move out! Teams of 3! 
 Yes, ma'am! 
 Radio checks at 5-minute intervals. 
 Let's go! 
 (Music playing) 
 It's not bad. 
 Maybe they'll hang it on the walls here one day. 
 Boy : Miller! 
 Look who finally got released. 
 Hey. 
 Miller. 
 I'm glad you're ok. 
 Yeah. Only took, what, 3 surgeries? 
 I hear you're fitting right in. 
 Twice a day. Don't forget. 
 You'll be ok in a few days. 
 Here. 
 Thanks. 
 Maya, top of the morning... is a very dumb thing to say that I saw in an old movie once. 
 Hey. You going to breakfast? 
 Yeah. You want to go together? 
 Sure, yeah. I... I'd love t... 
 (alarm blaring) 
 Um, save me a seat, ok? 
 Sorry. 
 Hey. What's going on? 
 That signal means the surface patrol is back and someone needs medical attention. 
 I have to go to quarantine. 
 Hey, Clarke. What are you doing? 
 Maybe they found survivors. 
 If our people are hurt, we have a right to know. 
 I'm pretty sure we shouldn't just go w... wandering around. 
 Maya : What are we dealing with? 
 They were attacked. One dead. He's in room two. 
 The other took off his gloves and mask to treat him. 
 He's still in decon, but he'll need treatment as soon as he's processed through. 
 Who attacked them? 
 What are they doing here? 
 Hey, stop! It's not safe! 
 It is for us. 
 Let's go, Jasper. 
 Someone's got to keep her out of trouble. 
 Clarke, slow down! 
 Stop pushing so hard. These people are... 
 Are lying to us. 
 That's a bullet wound. 
 Grounders don't use guns. 
 Unless the Grounders got the guns from us. 
 I don't think so. 
 I think our people are alive out there. 
 Get them out of here. 
 (Music playing) 
 (Baby crying) 
 (Crying continues) 
 (Crying continues) 
 How are you feeling? 
 Awesome. 
 She's lying. 
 I know that face. Just spit it out, Abby. 
 The bullet is still shifting. 
 That's why you're in pain. 
 I was hoping that it would stabilize by now. 
 So how about you take it out? 
 Raven, we need to talk about that. 
 The bullet is pressing on your spine. 
 If we leave it in, you'll live, but you'll never walk again. 
 And take it out? 
 The surgery could kill you. 
 We have no equipment, we have no anesthesia. 
 Will I walk again? 
 Maybe, but you'd be awake the whole time. 
 You'd feel everything. 
 Sign me up. 
 Wait. Raven, you could die. 
 In Zero G I didn't need my legs. 
 Down here, I do. 
 Take it out. 
 Where's Lincoln? 
 Drink. 
 Drink or die. Your choice. 
 All of it. 
 We need to talk. 
 Sure. Let's talk over breakfast. 
 Who shot that soldier? 
 The patrol that was looking for your people was attacked by what you call Grounders. 
 I fought Grounders. 
 They don't use guns. 
 I never mentioned guns. 
 Sergeant Shaw was shot by an arrow. 
 That's not true. I... I saw the wound. 
 Sometimes, we feel so strongly about our people we see things that aren't there. 
 I'd like to see the body. 
 Of course. 
 Come with me. 
 (Baby crying) 
 I know the air's not that great, but that's all we got left. 
 We're in a fine mess now, aren't we? 
 But I can't let you die up here with me. 
 Yes. 
 I guess we better find a way to get you to the ground, huh? 
 Yeah. You like that idea? 
 (Cooing) 
 Ooh. Ok. Ok. 
 Come on. Ok now, ok. 
 Let's see what we have left up here that can save us. 
 We're almost ready. 
 Do you want me to talk or just shut up? 
 Stop! 
 I'm so scared. 
 Look at me. 
 Ok? Just keep looking at me. 
 She's ready. 
 Aah! 
 (Raven screaming) 
 Yeah. That was me at the Grounder camp. 
 You know, I did everything I could not to scream, but eventually... but eventually, you broke and you told them everything. 
 And you wouldn't have because you're better than me. 
 Damn right. 
 I'm not a traitor. 
 I didn't tell them where they could find us. 
 And I did. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 After they tortured me in their prison camp for 3 days, but go ahead. 
 You just keep believing, even if you are in here just like me. 
 (Raven screaming and sobbing) 
 All right. Bring it in. 
 (Man screaming) 
 Now what? 
 Byrne : It's coming from the north. 
 On me. 
 
 
 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 (Man screaming) 
 (Groaning) 
 Campbell's alive. Cut him down. 
 Let's go! 
 (Groaning) 
 Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 We had to finish decontamination. 
 Thank you, Dr. Tsing. 
 The man with the burns, how is he? 
 He's improving. 
 I... I'd like to talk to him. 
 Sir, only patients are allowed in medical. 
 We can arrange that. 
 What is this? 
 It's a dialysis shunt. 
 We all have them in case of exposure. 
 Would you like to see the exit wound? 
 Sergeant Langston was forced to push the arrow out in the field. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 We've got it right here. 
 We may be out of luck, little man. 
 Where'd you get that? 
 Maybe I'll teach you to play someday. 
 Ship-to-ground. 
 I can't be that crazy. 
 You see that white door? 
 It's called an airlock. 
 Our ride is on the other side. 
 It's a missile. 
 Ironic, huh? 
 Our ancestors used them to destroy the world. 
 We're gonna use one to get back to it. 
 That's the good news. 
 The bad news is... we can't get to it unless we go outside. 
 How is she? 
 Well, she survived the surgery. 
 Don't ask me how. 
 She's a courageous kid. 
 That's one thing these kids have is courage. 
 Bellamy can't wait to get back out there. 
 Well, he wants to help his friends. 
 We all want to find out what happened to them, Abby, but not without a plan or a clear idea of what we're up against. 
 You didn't send that search team out, did you? 
 Those men were crucified. 
 That's a warning I intend to take very seriously. 
 We'll search high and low for the missing kids, you have my word, but not before we've secured this camp. 
 They tortured John Murphy. 
 They put a spear into Jasper Jordan's chest. 
 We can't wait. 
 Marcus... 
 Please. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I've made my decision. 
 You're feeling better. 
 Who are you? 
 Where's Lincoln? 
 I'm Nyko. 
 Lincoln is my friend. That's why I helped you. 
 (Groans) 
 You stand. Good. 
 Because now you should run. 
 Where's Lincoln? 
 He's answering for what he's done. 
 Because he helped you, our clan is vulnerable. 
 If the Reapers come, we can't even fight them off. 
 Wait, wait. 
 Are you saying that they caught him? 
 No, no. Wait. They'll kill him. 
 We have to do something. 
 Please. You said he's your friend. 
 We have to do something. 
 I did do something. 
 I saved your life. 
 Now run. 
 Unh! 
 Thank you for saving my life. 
 Augh! 
 Ai laik okteivia kom skai kru, and you have something I want. 
 Ai laik indra kom trigeda. 
 Chit yu gaf? 
 I said what do you want, Octavia of the sky people? 
 Lincoln. 
 No. 
 Agh! 
 (Speaking Grounder language) 
 Enough. Nyko is our only healer. 
 Good. Then you'll do as I say. 
 Agh! 
 Bring Lincoln to the place I saw him last. 
 He knows where that is. 
 Just you and him, no one else. 
 If I see anyone else, I'll kill your healer. 
 You have until dark. 
 Get up. 
 You felt that? 
 Yes, I felt that. 
 Good. Now the left. 
 Anything? 
 Try it again. 
 Try it again! 
 Finn. 
 Abby : Raven, I want you to tell me when you feel something, ok? 
 There. 
 Raven, it appears that you have significant damage to the nerves in your left leg. 
 Will it get better? 
 For now, you'll need crutches, but you're alive, and you're not in pain anymore. 
 But I'm still crippled. 
 I'm gonna give you two some time. 
 We always talk about you. 
 Don't you want to hear about my day? 
 I'm so tired. 
 Get some rest. 
 Hey. 
 When I wake up, don't be here. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You were here for me like always, and our friends are out there, and you need to go get them. 
 What did president Wallace say? 
 He showed me Shaw's body. 
 It looked like an arrow wound. 
 Well, maybe because it is an arrow wound. 
 Or that's what they want us to think. 
 What? They could have doctored it. 
 Clarke, you sound like a crazy person. 
 Why do you want to screw this up for us? 
 I don't know what this is. 
 This is... safe. 
 This is food, a real bed, clothes, and my personal favorite... not getting speared by Grounders. 
 How long do you think they'll let us stay here if you keep this up? 
 Did someone threaten you? 
 Heh. No. No. 
 It's common sense. 
 Look. We're guests here, not prisoners. 
 What would you do with a guest who kept calling you a liar and generally acted like an ungrateful ass? 
 Kick the ungrateful ass out. 
 Right now, biggest threat to us is you. 
 Computer : Missile bay airlock open. 
 Chancellor code accepted. 
 Automated missile launch sequence commencing. 
 Missile launch in T-minus 15 minutes. 
 Jaha : Yes. 
 Override lockout. 
 Don't want to miss our ride, little man. 
 Yes. 
 (Cries) 
 Don't worry. This o2 feeds the whole suit. 
 (Crying) 
 I know how you feel. 
 Computer : Missile launch in T-minus 7 minutes and counting. 
 7 minutes to fly across the ring, stick the landing, and climb into a missile before it launches. 
 No problem. 
 (Beep) 
 (Beeping) 
 Hold on, little man. 
 (Glass cracks) 
 (Air hissing) 
 (Groans) 
 Unh! 
 (Coughing) 
 Little man, let's never do that again. 
 No. 
 Computer : Missile launch in T-minus 4 minutes and counting. 
 No. 
 No. Huh? No! 
 (Sobbing) 
 Wells : Dad. 
 My son. 
 Son. 
 It's oxygen deprivation. 
 Stand up. 
 No. 
 You're not done yet. 
 I am done. 
 I am! 
 Our people still need you. 
 No. No. 
 I got them to the ground. 
 I did my job. 
 What would you tell me to do? 
 That's not fair. 
 You would tell me to live. 
 You've sacrificed so much. 
 Your life can be more than just impossible decisions and a tragic end. 
 You can choose to live. 
 I miss you, son. 
 Every day. 
 I'm always with you, dad. 
 You can do this. 
 Computer : Missile launch in T-minus two minutes and counting. 
 (Jaha's voice)  Disarm the warhead. 
 Check the missile's parachute. 
 (Jaha's voice)  Confirm the hard seal. 
 Don't forget your air tank. 
 Time to go home. 
 Get up. 
 We're going after them. 
 It's about time. 
 Murphy : Wait, wait. What about me? 
 Wait. No! What are you doing? 
 He's coming with us. 
 No way. 
 He's been to the Grounder prison camp. 
 He's right. Ok. I can bring you there. 
 Hey. Sterling just signaled. 
 Someone's coming. 
 (Music playing) 
 (Cheering) 
 First time I ever played it. 
 Cool. I loved it. 
 Man : Langston. 
 Where you going, man? 
 Tonight's movie night. 
 I got to pass. Doc says I got one more treatment. 
 Ah. 
 (Beep) 
 (Ding) 
 Only patients are allowed in medical. 
 Unh. 
 Computer : 3, 2, 1, launch. 
 Looks like you'll have to kill me. 
 Heh. 
 (Man grunting) 
 Lincoln. 
 He's hurt! 
 He should be dead. 
 Sorry. 
 Reapers! 
 Hyah! 
 Lincoln. 
 Lincoln : Octavia! Octavia! 
 Lincoln. 
 Octavia! 
 Ha ha! 
 (Wind blowing) 
 May we meet again. 
 Sterling : You don't think anyone saw us? 
 Shh. Keep it down. 
 Abby : You're late. 
 Bellamy decided to bring company. 
 He's the only person that's been in their camp. 
 Here. Find my son. 
 His name is Nathan Miller. 
 Bring them home. 
 (Door beeps) 
 Langston. 
 Langston. 
 What are they doing to you? 
 (Heart monitor beeping) 
 (Machinery whirring) 
 (Ventilator hissing) 
 (People moaning) 
 Anya?
