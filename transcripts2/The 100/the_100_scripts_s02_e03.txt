 Previously on "The 100"... 
 Where's Clarke? 
 Clarke's not here. 
 The Grounders took them. 
 You didn't send that search team out, did you? 
 I'm going after them. 
 Bring them home. 
 Welcome to Mount Weather. 
 This place is too good to be true. 
 You sound like a crazy person. 
 We're guests here, not prisoners. 
 Clarke, no! 
 You pull that lever, these people will die. 
 Even a little radiation could kill them. 
 Your DNA ran the same gauntlet as the Grounders. 
 Your ability to metabolize that radiation is even stronger. 
 Anya? 
 I'm gonna get you out of here. 
 (Whispering)  Come on. 
 Oh, damn it. 
 (Clank) 
 Ok. Come on. Quick. 
 Get back in. 
 (Grounders groaning) 
 Clarke : Hey. No. 
 Ok. We've gotta go. Now. 
 (Door creaks) 
 (Alarm blaring) 
 What is that? 
 I don't know. 
 Both : Aah! 
 Ahh. 
 What? Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Anya! Take my hand. 
 We're out. 
 Hey. 
 Come on. Get dressed. 
 We can't cover any ground like this. 
 I won't leave my people behind. 
 Anya, now, listen to me. 
 My people are still inside that place, too, but they have guards. 
 They have weapons. 
 Once we get out of here, we can find help. 
 We can come back. 
 There is no "we." 
 (Man speaking indistinctly) 
 Someone's coming. 
 (Men speaking indistinctly) 
 Not just someone, Reapers. 
 (Men speaking indistinctly) 
 Hey. Anya, you can't fight. 
 You can hardly stand. 
 I got a better idea. Come on. 
 (Man speaks indistinctly) 
 (Man speaks indistinctly) 
 (Man speaks indistinctly) 
 (Man speaks indistinctly) 
 (Man speaks indistinctly) 
 (Man grunting) 
 (Man speaks indistinctly) 
 (Wheel creaks) 
 (Wheels creaking) 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Prisoners were last seen at lights out, so, they must've left sometime in the past 6 hours. 
 Safe to say they headed for their dropship. 
 But we'll put Davis on the search team just to be safe. 
 He taught Earth skills. 
 He's dying to get some practical... we're not sending out a search team. 
 That'll put even more lives at risk. 
 I'm more worried about finding the people who helped them. 
 Abby : You wanted to see me? 
 Thank you, Major. 
 Tell me it wasn't you. 
 (Sigh) 
 Are we really back to this? 
 On the Ark, you did anything you wanted. 
 Without a second thought about the consequences. 
 On the Ark, I did what I needed to do, and I was right. 
 Just like now. 
 Letting prisoners go. Arming them. 
 Those are serious crimes, Abby. 
 As chancellor, you can't expect me to just... 
 You weren't elected chancellor, Marcus. 
 You only got the job because Thelonious beat you to redemption. 
 (Birds chirping) 
 Bellamy : All right, Murphy. Where to now? 
 What say we lose these first, huh? 
 No. Again. 
 If we get attacked out here, I have nothing to defend myself with. 
 I don't care. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. What the hell are you doing? 
 It was your idea to bring him. 
 Yeah, because he's the only one who's seen where the Grounders keep their prisoners. 
 Then we probably shouldn't let him be defenseless out here. 
 We can handle Murphy. 
 Better hope so. 
 So, do I get a gun now? 
 Octavia : You're going after the Reapers. 
 Lincoln taught me how to fight. Let me help. 
 Kill her. 
 (Grounders grunting) 
 (Grounders shouting indistinctly) 
 Jasper : I'm gonna open my eyes now. 
 Maya : No! No peeking. 
 Ok. Ok. Uh... 
 Where are you taking me, anyway? 
 Does the concept of surprise mean something different in space? 
 You should know I don't like surprises. 
 I hate them, actually. 
 Trust me. You're gonna like this one. 
 Open. 
 (Gasp) 
 Oh, wow. 
 Um, this one's my favorite. 
 Wallace goes in for landscapes and impressionists, but my taste runs a little darker. 
 Beautiful, isn't it? 
 Yeah. It is. 
 I don't know why they keep it all locked up down here. 
 It's pretty cool. 
 (Door opens)  Man: Hey. Who's in here? 
 Come on. 
 You think we lost them? 
 I actually don't think anyone was ever chasing us. 
 Jasper, have you seen Clarke? 
 Uh, no. 
 Nobody has. Hi. 
 Hi. Um, you guys should... 
 No. No, we're having breakfast. 
 Gonna meet you in line? 
 I've got a bad feeling. 
 Look, I'd love to talk to you about Clarke, any time in my entire life other than right now, ok? 
 What if she's in trouble? 
 (Sigh)  Trouble? It's Clarke. 
 Whatever she's up to, I'm sure she can handle it. 
 (Wheels creaking) 
 (Reaper speaking indistinctly) 
 (Reaper grunting) 
 (Reaper speaking indistinctly) 
 (Person screaming) 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Ok, come on. 
 What are you doing? Let's go. 
 (Crack) 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Everybody down. Down. 
 Murphy : This is it. 
 Told you I'd find it. 
 Bellamy : See nothing but Grounders. 
 Our people aren't here. 
 Finn : Wait a minute. 
 They've got stuff from our dropship. 
 So, maybe they know where our friends are. 
 Or maybe they killed them already. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 What is it? 
 The guy with the one eye. 
 Around his neck. 
 What am I looking at? 
 He's got Clarke's watch. 
 It was her father's. 
 She wouldn't give that up without a fight. 
 Neither will we. 
 Ok. You're with me. 
 You two, stay here, out of sight. 
 This thing goes south, take out the other Grounders, but don't shoot the Grounder with the watch. 
 Copy? 
 Copy. 
 Copy. 
 What about Murphy? 
 Yeah, do I get a gun now? 
 Something like that. 
 (Clacking) 
 (Clacking) 
 (Clacking) 
 (Clacking) 
 (Clacking) 
 Uhh! 
 We need to take him somewhere quiet. 
 I know just the place. 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 You sent for me, Sir? 
 Dr. Griffin has confessed to helping those boys escape and giving them guns. 
 She's to be supervised at all times and confined to quarters when not at work. 
 Is that clear? 
 What is it, Major? Spit it out. 
 Unauthorized use of firearms and aiding and abetting a prison escape are felonies. 
 The Exodus Charter is clear. 
 The punishment is shock-lashing. 
 I know she's your friend... 
 She's not just my friend. 
 She's a former member of the council and the most respected person in this camp. 
 Yes, sir, which is why it will work as a deterrent. 
 On the Ark, we had to be ruthless, uncompromising. 
 Our hand was always forced. 
 But down here... we have a chance to start over. 
 Make something better. 
 I hope that day will come, Sir. 
 But if we lose control of this camp... and we're on the knife's edge already... we won't live long enough to have that chance. 
 Man : Grab somebody... 
 A patrol. The Grounder prisoner. 
 They're bringing him in now. 
 (Indistinct shouting) 
 Kane : Let that man through! 
 No one is to touch him! Stand back! 
 Man : They have my son! They have my son! 
 Where is my son? Where is my son? I want... 
 (gunshot) 
 Medic! We need a medic here! 
 What the hell happened? 
 He went for my weapon. 
 Kept saying the Grounders have his son. 
 The gun just went off. 
 Get him to medical now. 
 Byrne : The knife's edge, sir. 
 Take the prisoner inside. 
 Byrne : Go! Everybody stay back. Stand back! 
 
 
 
 (Classical music playing) 
 Nice to see you, too. 
 Sorry. I was hoping you were Clarke. 
 You still haven't seen her? 
 No. 
 I don't think she slept in her bed last night. 
 What do we do? 
 Maya has access to everything through her job. 
 Maybe she could snoop around. 
 If Clarke's in trouble, she can find out. 
 I don't know. 
 Clarke doesn't trust them. 
 What if she's right? 
 We can trust Maya. 
 At least, I think we can. 
 Besides... what choice do we have? 
 Damn it. This place is a maze. 
 (Coughing) 
 What are they doing to us? 
 They use your blood. 
 I saw a soldier come in with radiation burns. 
 Hours later, he was fine. 
 It's like your blood is healing them somehow. 
 I've never seen anything like it. 
 Come on. This way. 
 Hey. Hey. What are you doing? 
 That's the way back to the Reapers. 
 You go your way, I'll go mine. 
 Anya, we need to stick together. 
 I told you there is no "we." 
 I saved your life. 
 You saved my life because you need me. 
 I know the way back to your people. 
 I know where the traps are hidden. 
 You'd never make it alone. 
 We don't have time for this. 
 Our best chance of making it out of here alive is together. 
 All we can do is keep moving and hope... 
 (whispering)  Anya. 
 Anya? 
 Stop! 
 We strike from the shadows when they stop to feed on our bait. 
 So, I'm the bait? 
 No. You are a warrior. 
 She's the bait. 
 I am not afraid. 
 You will be. 
 (Speaking indistinctly) 
 (Speaking indistinctly) 
 (Reaper speaking indistinctly) 
 Oh, no. 
 (Reaper growling) 
 No, no. 
 Please. 
 (Growls) 
 (Screaming) 
 (High-pitched beeping) 
 Get back! 
 Get the hell away from her! Now! 
 (Reapers screaming) 
 Man : Clarke Griffin, you're coming with us. 
 Jackson, find out if he has any family. 
 You need to come with us, ma'am. 
 What is this? 
 I'm sorry it had to come to this, Abby. 
 But you left me no choice. 
 Abigail Griffin has confessed to aiding and abetting known criminals. 
 And trafficking in firearms. 
 Under the laws set forth in the Exodus Charter of the Ark, she's been sentenced to 10 lashes. 
 (Crowd gasping) 
 You can't be serious. 
 On your command, Chancellor Kane. 
 (Gasp) 
 We don't have to do this down here. 
 (Electricity humming) 
 Proceed. 
 Aah! 
 Again. 
 Aah!  (Grunting) 
 Again. 
 (Electricity humming) 
 Aah! 
 Ohh! 
 (Abby groaning) 
 Again. 
 (Electricity humming) 
 Aah! 
 We're gonna do this again, and this time you're gonna stop screwing with us. 
 Where did you find this? 
 I told you. I found it outside your camp. 
 He's lying. 
 She would never take it off voluntarily. 
 I know. 
 Where is the girl who was wearing this watch? 
 I never saw a girl. 
 Another lie. 
 I mean, maybe you should stop asking him nicely. 
 Shut up, Murphy. 
 Where are our friends? 
 You took them. We know you did. 
 Just tell us where. 
 Murphy's right. 
 We're wasting time. 
 Delano : Uhh! 
 Answer the question! 
 Bellamy : Hey. Where's the girl who was wearing this watch? 
 Bellamy : Finn, stop! 
 You don't want to do this. Trust me. 
 There are some lines you can't uncross. 
 Where's Clarke? 
 Delano : Uhh! Where is she? 
 Back off! 
 Put down the gun, Finn. 
 (Cocks gun) 
 3 seconds. 
 Two! 
 One. 
 Ok! 
 I'll tell you. 
 Your friends are east of here. 
 The village where we take our prisoners of war. 
 East? Where? 
 How do we get to them? 
 I can draw you a map. 
 But you should hurry. 
 Soon they'll outlive their usefulness. 
 Get him something to draw a map. 
 You thought I was the crazy one, huh? 
 Answer the question. 
 Byrne : Answer the question! 
 Holster that weapon. 
 Those men you killed were my men. 
 I said stand down. 
 Now! 
 You get some air. 
 That's an order. 
 We can't keep this up... and hope to survive. 
 (Sigh) 
 There's gotta be a better way. 
 Man : She's in. 
 (Speaking native language) 
 (Speaking native language) 
 (Growling) 
 Uhh! Uhhhh! 
 Yah! 
 (Growling) 
 Uhh! 
 (Growling) 
 Uhh! 
 (Whispering)  Lincoln. 
 Where's Lincoln? 
 Where is Lincoln? 
 Please. Was Lincoln with you? 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 (Crying) 
 (Screaming) 
 You find out something? 
 What is it? 
 Apparently, Clarke had some kind of breakdown. 
 She just snapped. 
 Maya : Started pulling out her stitches, trying to hurt herself. 
 Where is she now? 
 Psych ward. Being monitored. 
 I talked to a friend who works there. 
 She thinks it might be a couple days before the doctors let anyone see her. 
 Monty : We'll see about that. 
 Hey... I'm sorry. 
 Last time I saw her, I called her crazy. 
 I never thought... 
 She's gonna be ok. 
 I saw everything. 
 I know what you're doing to them. 
 That's why you're going in the harvest chamber with them. 
 Alpha-Delta Two, we've reached the intake. 
 One prisoner in custody. 
 Man on intercom : Your mission was to bring back both of them. 
 The outsider cannot be allowed to leave this mountain. 
 Alpha-Delta One is coming out now. 
 Aaaah! 
 Aah! 
 His mask! 
 Uhh! 
 I found a way out. This way. 
 (Men screaming) 
 Man : We need to take them on. 
 Wait. There has to be another way. 
 There isn't. 
 Man : Just give up, Clarke. 
 You have no place else to go. 
 Anya! 
 Man : We don't have to kill you, Clarke. 
 Do you hear me? 
 It doesn't have to end like this. 
 Man : Drop your weapon. 
 Man : Hands up. 
 Take the prisoner. 
 (Wincing) 
 Thank you, Jackson. 
 So? Did it work? 
 Is the rest of the camp back in line? 
 This wasn't something I... 
 I considered lightly. 
 You don't have to justify yourself. 
 I broke the rules and I accept the consequences. 
 But you can lash me a hundred times and I am still gonna do whatever it takes to find those kids. 
 My kid. 
 I know that. 
 Then I guess we're done here. 
 (Grunts) 
 I'm leading a mission to bring them back. 
 This won't be a... bunch of kids looking to stir up a fight... but a diplomatic mission to make contact with the Grounders' commander... and negotiate for peace. 
 I'm taking the Grounder prisoner with me to guide the way. 
 Marcus, he could be leading you into a trap. 
 Perhaps. 
 It'll give us a chance. 
 I did hear you, you know. 
 Then I'll go with you. 
 No. No, you're needed here at camp. 
 No, Jackson can handle medical. 
 It's not just your medical expertise that'll be required. 
 I need to know that while I'm away, you'll set a good example for our people. 
 If you do this, I'll be a model citizen. 
 I need you to be more than that. 
 I need you to be chancellor. 
 Please, Abby. 
 For your people. 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 (Coughing) 
 (Gasping) 
 Thank you. 
 I think we should go back to the dropship first. 
 So I can see who my people... 
 We're not going back to your dropship. 
 You killed 300 of my warriors. 
 I can't show my face without a prize. 
 Gather up the gear. We're leaving. 
 What about him? 
 For now, we leave him. 
 Deal with him when we're done. 
 What if he escapes? 
 He knows exactly where we're going. 
 We're not killing him. 
 Murphy : I'm not really seeing another option here. 
 If we don't take care of this now, this is gonna blow back on us and you know that. 
 He's unarmed, Murphy. 
 He's a Grounder. 
 Really? Come on. Tell him. 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know what? 
 He's gonna tell his people everything. 
 We're as good as dead. 
 Our friends, too. 
 We're not doing this. 
 End of discussion. You want him, you gotta go through me. 
 And what exactly happened to you, huh? 
 You're talking like you've never killed a Grounder before. 
 That was in battle. 
 This would be an execution. 
 (Gunshot) 
 Let's get moving. 
 (Door opens) 
 If you're gonna kill me, get it over with. 
 You proved yourself well, Octavia of the sky people. 
 We'll let you live. 
 Lincoln was a good man. 
 He was my brother. 
 (Groaning) 
 Man : All right. Next. 
 Harvest. 
 Harvest. 
 Harvest. 
 Mark this one for the Cerberus program.
