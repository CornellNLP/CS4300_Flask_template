 Listen up, everybody. The clock is ticking. There's no time to waste. Every moment counts. 
 So... let's get those items into those boxes and let's try to make sure it's the right items in the right boxes, okay? 
 You with me? 
 ♪ ♪ 
♪ Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ 
 It's gonna be a good day, Sal. 
 Your pep talk was deeply inspiring. 
 Hi, Kareema. I'm working. 
 Honestly, I don't know what's sadder: the utter meaninglessness of this job, or your attempts to imbue it with meaning. 
 Then I remember there is no sadness and we're all just specks of dust in an infinite universe. 
 Well, your hair looks cute today. 
 Thanks. I know. 
 Demon breath incoming. 
 Suck it up. 
 (all inhale) 
 So, I just fired Melinda. 
 Please inform Human Resources. 
 (sobbing) 
 (all exhale) 
 I don't know how you cover her desk all day. 
 Scuba diving lessons. 
 I mastered breath control. 
 Hey, if Melinda's out, that means there's a spot open on the Cyber Hugs team. 
 Not it. 
 What? 
 Traveling the world to research the charities the company donates to? 
 It's a dream job. 
 So why don't you apply? 
 I don't know. 
 I mentioned it to Deirdre once before. 
 (laughs) That's adorable, but no. 
 May I ask why? 
 Well, you're not a leader. 
 People don't listen when you talk, you're too timid, you don't motivate people, you lack confidence, you don't command respect, you're an inspiration to absolutely no one. 
 Whoa. 
 That's harsh. 
 Deirdre can suck my... 
 Weiner schnitzel! 
 Yum! 
 ♪ ♪ 
 So, listen, guys: big news. 
 I finally saw him again yesterday. Dream Guy. 
 I take it you're off with Timothy again? 
 Yes. 
 I really like Sweet T. 
 I mean, we do trivia night together. 
 First runners-up, two weeks in a row. 
 Okay, look: this other guy? 
 He's not your dream guy. 
 He's just a stranger that you've projected all your soft-core fantasies onto. 
 He's not technically a stranger. 
 Please don't tell the rutabaga story again. 
 I was at the farmers' market... 
 Excuse me, sir? 
 What kind of listeria precautions do you take with your rutabagas? 
 All of them? 
 Could I get mine dipped in E. coli? 
 Ew. 
 Hey. 
 (music plays faintly in background) 
 Oh, I'm Xavier. 
 With an “X.” 
 I'm... 
 I gotta go. 
 (laughs) 
 “Xavier with an ex.” 
 He was telling me he was single and I blew it. 
 Pretty sure he was just telling you how his name is spelled. 
 Well, either way, I want a do-over. 
 Hank : You want to find this guy, Evie? 
 Here's what you do. 
 You go on the Dark Net, you find yourself a Korean hacker to steal his address. 
 Is that legal? 
 It's effective. 
 For $35, I found out where Vin Diesel lives. 
 Why? 
 I like his movies. 
 Look, just don't be one of those women defined by the quest to find the guy. 
 It's boring. 
 Yeah. 
 You know what? You're right. 
 I mean, if he shows up on my doorstep, fine. 
 But in the meantime, I'm just gonna, you know, live my life, do my thang. 
 Yeah. Maybe don't say “my thang” anymore. 
 Hmm-mm. 
 Yeah. 
 I won't. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 No way. 
 Holy smokes. 
 I mean, how many Xaviers can there be in this neighborhood? 
 It's gotta be him. 
 And 1031 South Kensington? 
 What are the chances? 
 This is amazing! 
 I know! Right? 
 Joshie's having his first applesauce! 
 Oh. 
 That's great. 
 Anyway, it's not crazy to just go over there, is it? 
 Like, I won't go inside. 
 Oh, God, no. 
 No, no! 
 Relax, it's just... 
 Joshie is having his first applesauce barfie. 
 (Joshie spitting up wetly) 
 Maybe now isn't the best time. 
 Look, sis, just meet this guy already, okay, and deliver the thing. 
 But you get out of there if any alarm bells go off for you. 
 Okay... 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Okay. 
 Oh, wow, heavy. 
 (bottle clattering) 
 (panting) 
 You okay there? 
 Uh, not really. 
 Thank you so much. 
 I should really join a gym. 
 Well, this is it. 
 Thanks for letting me borrow your wheels. 
 (knocking) 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 I have for you, this... 
 They, um... they brought it to my house, but it should have been your house, which is where it is now, because of me bringing it. - Oh, brilliant! 
 That's my Carpe Diem beer. 
 You know, they only make a hundred cases of this a year. 
 You have to try one. 
 Sure, okay. 
 I'm... I'm Evie, by the way. 
 I'm Xavier. 
 I think we've, um, seen each other around the neighborhood, actually. 
 Really? 
 Huh. 
 So you like Whitesnake, Evie? 
 Yeah. 
 How did you...? 
 Oh! (laughs) 
 Right. I forgot I was wearing this. 
 I was wearing a lot of different things before, and then I was wearing this, and I still am, I guess. 
 You all right? 
 Oh... 
 Oh, the beer... it's turned. 
 It's real bad. 
 Yeah, no, it's sour beer. 
 Ugh. Ugh, exactly. 
 No, no, no, it's perfectly fine, it's just... 
 (laughs) ...it's just sort of an acquired taste. 
 Oh. 
 (chuckles) 
 Well, now I know why they only make a hundred cases a year. 
 Let me get you something else. 
 Come on. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Wow, it's... it's like you live in a SkyMall catalog. 
 I know. Thanks. 
 Is this... 
 Did you hike the Inca trail to Machu Picchu? 
 Wow, I've always wanted to do that. 
 So why haven't you? 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 You know, traveling is expensive and... 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Work is really busy. 
 It just feels like there's never a good time. 
 Well, do you have some time right now? 
 For what? 
 Whatever you want. 
 (game dings, canned crowd cheers) 
 Evie, I've got a very serious question to ask you: 
 (laughs) 
 Are you now or have you ever been a member of the WNBA? 
 Oh, my gosh, your life is so much fun. 
 Right? 
 You must have a pretty good job. 
 Oh, no, no. Actually, I don't work. 
 What, so you just, like... you, like, rob banks or something? 
 Uh, no, I just don't think spending all day in a cubicle is the best way to live. 
 (game dings, canned crowd cheers) 
 Plus, I gotta live life while I can. 
 What does that mean? 
 Um... God, there's not really an easy way to say this. 
 Oh, my God. Are you sick? 
 No. No, no, no, nothing like that. 
 Then what? 
 What is it? 
 Um... 
 (sighs) 
 The world is ending. 
 Excuse me? 
 Humankind only has eight months and 12 days left on Earth. 
 You're serious? 
 Yeah. Yeah, the apocalypse is, um, you know... nigh. 
 (alarm blaring) 
 Yeah, well, it's certainly been interesting. 
 Hang on, hang on. Look, I get it. 
 You think I'm nuts. 
 No. 
 You're just, you're... you're not what I thought you'd be. 
 What's that? 
 Not... nuts. 
 Look, look, I used to be a regular guy, okay, with khaki slacks and a tie and a job. 
 Doing what? 
 Copy editing for a science magazine. 
 Xavier :  And that's when I read about asteroid 2000 WX 354,  and how it's gonna buzz past the Earth in eight months and 12 days. 
 But I believe, based on atmospheric expansion due to global warming, that there's gonna be an impact. 
 An asteroid is gonna crash into Earth? 
 Yes. 
 Then why hasn't NASA said anything about it? 
 Well, maybe they don't know about it. 
 Or maybe they do. I don't know. 
 They won't respond to me e-mails. 
 No, I think they would tell us if an asteroid was gonna hit us. 
 Would they? Would they? 
 Yes. Yes! 
 Unless they're scared everyone's gonna start freaking out. 
 This is preposterous. 
 No. Actually, it, um... it totally checks out. I, uh... 
 I did the math. 
 Oh, God. 
 Too much? 
 Yeah. 
 Too soon. 
 Why don't I show you? 
 Xavier : All right, you see that one in the top left? 
 It's just a little bit brighter than the others. 
 Yeah, kind of. 
 That's our boy. 
 Xavier : It's the size of Mount Everest, and it's headed right at us at 30,000 miles an hour, give or take. 
 Incidentally, have you ever climbed Mount Everest? 
 'Cause now would be the time. 
 If this is all true... 
 Which it is. 
 Well, then, why aren't you doing anything about it? 
 Why aren't you telling people? 
 Trust me, I've tried. 
 I've called everyone. 
 The White House, MIT, Oprah. 
 When that didn't work... 
 There's an asteroid headed towards Earth. 
 I don't know if you're interested in the apocalypse. 
 No? 
 Man : Yo! 
 So... we're all doomed? 
 No, no. We're all liberated. 
 No more flossing, no more separating whites and colors. 
 I'm racking up parking tickets and they're never gonna get paid. 
 It's great... I'm living life exactly on my own terms. 
 Wait, are you the guy that keeps parking on the sidewalk in front of the bank? 
 Yeah, I don't have time to wait for a spot to open. 
 We're all doomed. I mean... aren't there things you wish you never had to do again? 
 I mean... yeah. 
 Like what? 
 Like... wear a bra. 
 Love it. Lose it. 
 Deal with my obnoxious boss. 
 Sure. Yuck. 
 Go to a hospital. 
 I mean, if you're worried about your health, why would you ever go to the epicenter of germs? 
 All right, okay, I'll buy that. 
 What else? 
 And I would stop waxing, definitely. 
 Eyebrows, v*g1n*, moustache. 
 Sure. Yep, let it grow. 
 I mean, Tom Selleck's moustache made him a sexual icon. 
 (chuckles) Yeah. 
 The point is we have to stop doing all the things that we feel obligated to do and start doing the things that we want to do. 
 That's why I made this. 
 It's my apocalyst. 
 This is every fantasy I've ever had. 
 Every regret I want to fix, every wrong I want to right. 
 Every last thing I want to do before things go kaput. 
 I try and do one thing every day. 
 Pick one. 
 Pick one, we'll do it together. 
 (clears throat) 
 “Run with the bulls.” 
 ”Try psychedelics.” 
 (laughs) ”Touch the North Pole.” 
 ”Sleep with taco truck girl.” 
 ”Sleep with other taco truck girl,” which is already... 
 That's crossed off, actually, yeah. 
 ”Sleep with Andie MacDowell.” 
 Mm. 
 “Try to find hot rutabaga girl from the farmers' market.” 
 Wait a mi... 
 Am I “hot rutabaga girl”? 
 You remembered me? 
 Yeah, well, you make an impression. 
 (chuckles) 
 I mean, to be honest, I didn't even know if I was gonna see you again, and then you turn up on my doorstep like... 
 A statistical anomaly? 
 Well, I was gonna say fate, but... that's much more romantic. 
 So what do you say? 
 You in? 
 Let me, um... get back to you. 
 Hank, you're a conspiracy guy. 
 What do you think? He's nuts, right? 
 (laughing) 
 Totally nuts! All right? 
 An asteroid's not gonna destroy the world. 
 The Russians are. 
 Say again? 
 Nuclear holocaust. 
 I've spent the last four years hoarding office snacks that are high in preservatives to survive the fallout. 
 Gummies. That's your plan? 
 Yep. I also got a jar of pickles in the filing cabinet. 
 Now, you're heard of Jade Helm, right? 
 No. 
 On May 22, the U.S. military is conducting a massive so-called “training exercise,” code name “Jade Helm,” that involves ferrying all the government elite into deep, underground bunkers as “a drill.” 
 So? 
 So that's exactly what you do when there's a nuclear annihilation on the horizon. 
 And mark my words, I'm gonna fight my way up into that bunker... I'm gonna be all up in it. 
 Check this out. 
 I even got the day pre-approved for vacation by Deirdre. 
 Bam! 
 Hey, have you guys ever heard of Jade Helm? 
 Oh, is she the new judge on  The Voice ? 
 No, Mom. 
 I still think you should try out for that show, sweetheart. 
 No way! 
 Voice of an angel. 
 You would get a four-chair turn. 
 Mm, if she didn't faint from stage fright first. 
 Oh, or worse. Remember the fourth grade play? 
 Oh... 
 ♪ Happy and... ♪

 Yeah, they called me Heavie Evie for years. 
 Oh, sweetie, they called you lots of things. 
 Blondie Blowchunks, Hurl Girl, Pukey Brewster. 
 Okay, yeah, great. That's probably enough. 
 Gwen Stebarfie. 
 That was a good one. 
 (laughter) 
 Mother : Is that Timothy? 
 I thought you two broke up. 
 Oh, I love him. But he is so quiet. 
 I wish he came with subtitles. 
 Hey there, Timothy. What a surprise. 
 What brings you here? 
 Anybody get that? 
 Yeah, he, uh... (clears throat) 
 He said he got a present for Tucker. 
 Oh! 
 Present! 
 (laughter) 
 What is it? 
 Kneepads? 
 What do you say, Tucker? 
 No, thank you. 
 (embarrassed chuckle) 
 Well, thank you, Timothy. 
 Tucker's mom appreciates it even if Tucker doesn't. 
 Thanks. 
 You are gonna make such a wonderful father someday. 
 Father : You're already one heck of a writer. 
 I read your article on crypto-currencies in the new issue of Wired there. 
 Didn't understand a lick of it, but I clipped it out and mailed it off to Evie. 
 Isn't that right, sweetheart? 
 Yeah, he did. 
 It was sweet of you to get Tucker a gift, but people who are spending some time apart probably shouldn't be spending time together. 
 (clears throat) Unless one of them wants to spend forever together. 
 I know that sometimes I can be soft-spoken. 
 But today, I am not afraid to shout my love at peak volume. 
 (exhales) 
 (sighs) 
 Evie Marie Covington, your love was like a-a Trojan virus that snuck past my firewall and melted my motherboard. 
 I love you. 
 I-I love your kindness and your spazzy dance moves and your organized pen drawers. 
 But more than anything, I love the idea of-of you and I spending the next seven decades together... 
 Depending on advancements in biometrics, of course. 
 Will you make me (exhales) the happiest man in the observable universe and-and be my wife? 
 (quietly): Oh... 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 “Be my wife”" (chuckles)

 That was so sweet, and such a surprise. 
 Uh...

 He's, um... 
 They delivered a package for him here by mistake and I returned it. 
 And he just... he just started stalking you? 
 Do we need to think about a restraining order? 
 I know a guy. 
 No, it's... more complicated than that. 
 I see. 
 It was a mistake and it's ovenow. 
 I just... 
 I need to get my job back. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, here's what you do. 
 Tomorrow morning just go into Deirdre's office and say... 
 As you can see, my computer has a different IP address than the one that sent you that nasty e-mail. 
 So, you're saying someone else sent this? 
 Yes. 
 Some wackadoo hacked my account. 
 Believe me, there is nothing I want more than this job. 
 Because it is such a great place to work. 
 And you are... an incredible and... inspiring person to work for. 
 So you don't think that I, quote, “Look like Judge Judy's birth mother”? 
 No. 
 Or that my breath smells like a loaf of freshly baked barf? 
 Deirdre, I find you and your breath just... delightful. 
 Good. 
 I am glad to hear that. 
 Because I would (breathy): hate to hear that you haven't been happy here. 
 Oh. 
 Fine. 
 Since yesterday was the most productive day your team has had all year, I will rehire you. 
 On one condition. 
 Anything. 
 I'm sure you've noticed I harbor feelings for Hank that go beyond appreciation for his ext eme competence as an assistant. 
 Oh... 
 Yeah, you two have a lot of, a lot of chemistry. 
 (toilet flushes) 
 Safe to go in there? 
 Uh, I'd give it a minute. 
 I appreciate your honesty, Hank. 
 The connection is palpable,  yet he seems unaware of our potential. 
 So I will require your assistance to win his affections. 
 These are the HR guidelines for interoffice fraternization. 
 Study them. 
 Like all good love stories, our romance must be both passionate and legally permissible. 
 (loud bang) 
 (gasps) 
 (laughs) 
 (thud, Evie grunts) 
 (car alarm beeping) 
 Oh, my God. 
 Operator : 911, what's your emergency? 
 (car alarm continues beeping) 
 Um... uh, a pogo accident. 
 (monitor beeping rhythmically) 
 (exhales) 
 Well, this is embarrassing. 
 Just relax, please, ma'am. 
 You know what? I actually feel pretty good. 
 I-I don't really do hospitals, so I think I'm gonna j... I'm just gonna, um... 
 I'm sorry, ma'am, but you have to wait for the doctor. 
 Geez, I feel like such a klutz. 
 How did I even get here? 
 Your boyfriend called an ambulance. 
 He's been out sitting in the waiting room for hours. 
 My...? 
 (indistinct announcement over P.A.) 
 Want me to go get him for you? 
 No. Absolutely not. 
 He's not my boyfriend. 
 He's a crazy person. 
 He's the entire reason why I'm even here. 
 Okay, Evie. 
 In terms of the fall, it's pretty minor, just a mild concussion. 
 Great. 
 I'll just... I'll just, I'll take some aspirin and just get out of your hair. 
 But we did find a problem with your heart. 
 What kind of problem? 
 You have Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. 
 This means there's an extra electrical pathway in your heart that's causing it to beat too fast. 
 Wh... How serious is it? 
 We're gonna need to get you into surgery immediately. 
 (monitor beeping rhythmically) 
 Man : Count backward from 100. 
 100... 
 99... 
 90... eight months... asteroid... 
 SkyMall... 
 (indistinct announcement over P.A.) 
 How do you feel, sweetheart? 
 I feel... really happy to see you guys. 
 You're out of the woods now, honey. 
 Doctor said you are as good as new. 
 And early detection is key in cases like this. 
 It's just lucky you're such a klutz. 
 Are you saying a pogo stick crash saved my life? 
 (laughs) 
 Here's a sentence I never thought I would say: Thank goodness you were not wearing a helmet. 
 (laughing) 
 Honey. 
 Honey. 
 No, I'm good. 
 All good. I am just gonna live my life. 
 Honey. 
 Do my thang! 
 Oh! 
 (laughing): As soon as the painkillers wear off. 
 I'm gonna do my thang. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 (laughs) Yeah. 
 (quietly): Just four. 
 I'm sorry. What? 
 I... 
 Uh... 
 Hi. 
 You-you look... you look great. 
 Uh, you want a beer? 
 I don't want to get married. 
 So, no beer? 
 It's not because I don't think you're a great guy. 
 You are. 
 I'm just, I'm... 
 I'm not ready. 
 Is this because of that other guy? 
 The one who sent the e-mail? 
 No, it's-it's... it's not about... 
 I'm just... 
 I'm not ready to get married. 
 It doesn't mean I won't ever be. 
 I get it. 
 I'm not exciting, but I am reliable... and that makes me a great backup plan. 
 You're not a backup plan. 
 You're right. 
 I-I'm not. 
 And w-when it falls apart with this guy... and it will... 
 I'm not going to be there to pick up the pieces. 
 Okay? 
 I-I-I get to move on, too. 
 Even though it'll be unbelievably hard. 
 I have to move on. 
 Okay? 
 And... and I will. 
 Um... 
 I... but I did order food here, so... uh, s-so maybe... maybe you leave. 
 Oh... sure. 
 (exhales) 
 Hey, I was... 
 Shut up, listen. 
 I don't care if an asteroid's gonna kill us all. 
 No, I mean, no, of course would care, if it's true, but my point is, I'm the one who decides how I live my life, not you. 
 And I'm keeping my job. 
 In fact, I'm going to apply for a new position there that I'm incredibly excited about and I finally feel ready for and, yeah, maybe you helped me learn to seize the day, but I will be seizing it at my own pace, thank you very much. 
 Okay. 
 In addition, I like your... bum, too, probably more than you like mine. 
 (chuckles) 
 Man, I doubt that. 
 Plus, you... kind of saved my life. 
 So, now I want to make the most of it and I think we should keep hanging out. 
 You made a list. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 I happen to love lists. 
 And this way we can do one off of yours and then one off of mine. 
 It's only fair. 
 Honestly, I can't think of a better way to spend my last eight months. 
 Shall we do another? 
 Can I borrow your microwave? 
 ♪ Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh ♪ 
 (electricity crackling) 
 ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ 
♪ Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh... ♪ 
 (loud pop) 
 (screams) 
 (laughs) 
 Okay. You were right. 
 That was way cooler than I expected. 
 See? 
 I told you. 
 Yeah, you did. 
 Which leads me to a very serious question. 
 Okay, what is it? 
 What's next? 
 ♪ You and I both know that the house is haunted. ♪ 
 (pounding on door) 
 Jesse! 
 Cuz, we did it. 
 (laughs) 
 I need a change of clothes, I need hair dye and I need whatever tool takes these off my body. 
 Holy smokes! 
 What? We've only got eight months left to live. 
 He's not gonna waste it in prison. 
 (sirens wailing) 
 The fuzz!
