 Previously on "Whiskey Cavalier" - Agent Chase. 
  - Sir? 
  - In my office. 
  - Yes, sir. 
  Will, you're one of our best agents. 
  Your mission is to pick up Standish, bring him back to Paris within 48 hours. 
  Can I help you? 
  I'm Todd. 
  And this is my desk. 
  - I've been working at this desk for a while now. 
  - Of course you have. 
  You just swoop in and take whatever you want, because that's what Americans do. 
  Susan, right? 
  Will's bestie. 
  Listen, Will's not answering his phone. 
  I thought you might I don't know where he is. 
  Wow, you are a terrible liar. 
  And I don't think I like you, Ray. 
  Edgar Standish. 
  Let's take a look at that tooth. 
  You've been selling the weapons that we seize. 
  That's why you sent me to bring back Standish. 
  Because of you, I'm gonna have to kill all these people. 
  Aah! 
  There's no time left. 
  This has to happen now. 
  We need to pick names for Secret Santa. 
  I'm not crazy, right? 
  It's an odd time to celebrate Christmas. 
  Well, the holidays are our busiest time, so we celebrate in the off season. 
  This is a Supplemental Holiday for Espionage Professionals. 
  I'm calling it SHEP. 
  Or Spy Christmas. 
  Yeah, I'm a Hindu. 
  Guys, I love everything about Christmas. 
  Ooh, hey! 
  Tonight, after this, you want to come over to my place, help me decorate my tree? 
  You're kidding, right? 
  Yes. 
  Of course I'm kidding. 
  I don't have a-a tree that stays up all year. 
  How did you get stuck with Secret Santa? 
  You lose a bet? 
  Well, as I'm sure you're all aware, I sometimes have problems connecting with people. 
  "No, Jai, you're delightful. 
  " But I have been trying. 
  That's true. 
  He came up to me yesterday out of the blue and asked me how I was doing. 
  He didn't stick around for the answer, but I was fine, by the way. 
  And now the cliffhanger is over. 
  See, I've been making really good progress, but Susan, here, feels I need to open myself up to more workplace bonding activities. 
  I'm so excited. 
  I called it "making friends," but whatever. 
  You got to have love in your heart for everyone that you work with. 
  "Ray"? 
  - Hell no. 
  I want a diff - Nope. 
  Briefcase is now closed. 
  30 bucks or less. 
  No gag gifts. 
  Happy SHEP, everyone. 
  You know, I got a Christmas sweater at home with your name on it. 
  Oh, do you? 
  Yeah. 
  My aunt's name is Tina. 
  She left it there one time. 
  That went from sexy to not sexy at all real quick, didn't it? 
  - Yes, it did. 
  - Uh-huh. 
  You're still cute, though. 
  I'll see you in a few days. 
  I got a mission in Miami. 
  Ooh, Miami. 
  Cool. 
  What is it? 
  Same ol', same ol'. 
  Some corrupt billionaire playboy. 
  I gotta seduce him to get some bank codes. 
  See you later. 
  All right. 
  She just say "seduce"? 
  Frankie, you're an agent who's made some questionable decisions in the field. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Seducing is, like, an over-the-pants thing, right? 
  I-It's no different than if you were dating an actress and she had to do a romantic love scene. 
  Right. 
  Nothing to be concerned about because it's fake. 
  No, I'm saying that sometimes you actually have to have s*x to make it look real. 
  Oh. 
  Too mean? 
  Yeah. 
  But so good. 
  Y'know the mistake Standish is making? 
  Look, if you're dating someone and you want the relationship to have a chance, you have to trust that person completely. 
  Mnh, that's not a thing. 
  Oh, it's a thing. 
  I know it's your favorite topic, but no one trusts anyone completely. 
  I trust you completely. 
  No, you don't. 
  Uh All the "shady" things from my past, the way I make rash decisions on the fly? 
  I don't even know what I'm doing half the time. 
  Why are you trying to convince me not to trust you? 
  I'm making a point. 
  I mean, let's hypothetically say years from now, we're married. 
  Okay, how how how would that happen? 
  Just go with it. 
  So, you think that we're happy. 
  And then you come home one day and I'm wearing a sexy nightgown and there's a handsome stranger in the bathtub. 
  Do I still have your complete trust? 
  Yep. 
  Because I'm sure there's some reasonable explanation. 
  Like what? 
  Okay, he was working out in the back, and he fell through the ice in our pond. 
  And, yes, we have a pond. 
  So you took him inside, you put him in the bath just to get him warm, and you got your clothes wet, so you had to take them off. 
  And, no, you did not have a nightgown on underneath, because that would just be ridiculous, but you put on my favorite nightgown 'cause you knew I was coming home and because you have this kinky thing where you like to have s*x while someone else is in the house. 
  You're insane. 
  Yeah, but in a good way? 
  Hey, party people! 
  Ray is in the house. 
  Okay, Ray. 
  Before you hooked up with Gigi, did Will trust you completely? 
  He did. 
  Uh, oh! 
  And thanks for bringing that up. 
  No one's talked about it in a while. 
  Anyway, I come bearing mission! 
  Who's excited? 
  Okay. 
  Love doing that. 
  So, the team needs to head to Europe for a prisoner transfer. 
  This guy may have intel on The Trust. 
  I hate that they call themselves "The Trust. 
  " I know. 
  It's an important word to Will. 
  Oh, I'm aware. 
  Okay, prisoner transport. 
  Why us? 
  Well, because MI6, CIA, FBI, they've all been infiltrated. 
  And the more we learn about The Trust, the more we see their fingerprints on global terror events. 
  We're afraid they're planning something huge. 
  EUROPOL thinks that this prisoner may be the best chance to figure out when and where the next attack will take place. 
  All right, so what's our job on the ground? 
  You will be escorting him from a black site to a private airstrip where he will be transferred for interrogation. 
  You two will be in one of the follow cars with Standish. 
  It's a babysitting gig. 
  No, no, no, no. 
  This is a very high-level operation that requires the utmo Okay, yes, it's a babysitting gig. 
  But at least you guys will be back in time for the Spy Christmas party in the Hive. 
  All right, let's get the team ready to roll. 
  Hey, I still don't understand how we ended up getting married. 
  You had a rich uncle who died, and I married you for the inheritance. 
  Oh. 
  Well, that's dirty. 
  I never know what's going on. 
  Hey, Tina. 
  Hey, it's me. 
  Just wanted to call, say hi, and I missed you. 
  You're probably busy seducing that guy. 
  It's all good, though. 
  I'm not worried about it. 
  You know. 
  You got to do what you got to do for your country, right? 
  I'm doing the same thing here in France. 
  But not the you know, the same thing. 
  That'd be weird, right? 
  Both of us on missions doing s*x things. 
  But, yeah, hope it's going well. 
  Is that your fault? 
  Uh, I got to go here, but good luck with the seducing. 
  I'll talk to you later. 
  All right. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Standish! 
  Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming. 
  So, who is this prisoner, anyway? 
  No idea. 
  Ray said EUROPOL is so worried about leaks, they haven't even released his identity at the highest levels. 
  Ollerman? 
  No way. 
  Why is he still alive? 
  Nice to see you all, too. 
  They told you I died, didn't they? 
  See? 
  That's the problem with having all these secrets in my head. 
  I'm worth too much. 
  That, and your aim sucks. 
  How about we just finish this right now? 
  All right. 
  Let's just stay calm. 
  Take some deep breaths, all right? 
  What do you mean? 
  He tried to kill us. 
  Why would they even assign us to pick him up, anyway? 
  He pulled my tooth out with pliers. 
  It was a fake tooth. 
  It's still messed up. 
  Don't diminish my trauma. 
  Guys, look, I don't know why we got this mission. 
  It doesn't matter. 
  We have a job to do, and we're gonna finish it like we always do. 
  Agreed? 
  Agent Chase done with his pep talk? 
  I always used to love those. 
  Shall we? 
  We do have a schedule to keep. 
  So, the Boy Scout partnered with the sociopath. 
  How's that working out? 
  It's going really well, for your information. 
  Hey, not helping. 
  Why don't you just get in the van before I do something I'm gonna regret? 
  Oh, come on, Will. 
  That's not your speed. 
  Yeah, but it's her speed. 
  Let's roll. 
  - I'm dreaming of a white Christmas - Merry Spy Christmas. 
  Hey! 
  Merry Spy Christmas. 
  Ooh, and a Merry Spy Christmas. 
  Yes, hi. 
  Oh, and a Merry Spy Christmas to you, mister. 
  Oh, you don't get a candy cane if you don't smile. 
  Fine. 
  God, I can't do this anymore. 
  - Hey, Susan. 
  - Hey. 
  Please don't make me talk to anyone else. 
  Please. 
  How long have you even tried? 
  It's not about how long I tried, it's about the effort that I put in. 
  Less than a minute. 
  Well I can't really judge you. 
  I still haven't gotten Ray his Secret Santa gift, so I'm I'm wrapping up this stapler I found. 
  Okay. 
  Have you Have you seen any of the team? 
  Not a word. 
  No, it's full security protocol. 
  Wow. 
  This must be a highly classified asset. 
  They've been on complete electronic blackout - since they left here. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  You haven't seen my stapler around, have you? 
  Ooh. 
  No, Todd. 
  It's just that that poorly wrapped gift is the exact shape of my stapler. 
  No, it's not. 
  This is a a toy bus that I bought for my nephew. 
  With every Christmas card I write Thank you so much. 
  It's exactly what I wanted. 
  Brits. 
  Hey! 
  You think Ray would like an empty cup? 
  Yeah, absolutely. 
  - I can decorate it. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Write his name on it. 
  - "Ray. 
  " - Yeah. 
  "Ray's cup. 
  " And may all Your Christmases Be white How we doing? 
  Checking the satellite. 
  Airspace clear. 
  Road clear. 
  Electronic signature still invisible. 
  We are all good. 
  What the hell?! 
  Shooter, 11:00! 
  Hold on! 
  Get down! 
  Everyone out of the car! 
  Aah! 
  Standish, stay down! 
  Shooter up top. 
  We're never gonna make the Christmas party. 
  Ah, nobody shows up to those things on time, anyway. 
  We got to get to the van before Ollerman gets killed. 
  Right. 
  Hey, you can leave that thing here, huh? 
  I don't go anywhere without my laptop! 
  Okay. 
  I think Standish is in shock. 
  All right, follow my lead. 
  - Standish, cover us. 
  - Aah! 
  God. 
  Frankie, you check the cargo. 
  Standish, you cover me, okay? 
  Here we go. 
  Hey, we're never gonna make it to the drop. 
  I need you to reroute us to the Hive. 
  This is exactly why I bring the laptop. 
  That, and I got a lot of music that I haven't backed up yet. 
  Hang on. 
  Sounds like a party out there. 
  Shut up! 
  Last time I saw you, you were on a kitchen table bleeding out. 
  I wish I could say the same. 
  Hey, Will, good news. 
  Prince Charming's still with us. 
  Great. 
  Jingle bells, jingle bells Last year, all they put out was boxed wine and gas station sushi. 
  A lot of people got sick, including me. 
  But I got my bathing suit body back like Whoo! 
  Ooh! 
  Tiny little hot dogs. 
  Hey. 
  Excuse me. 
  Hey. 
  They're back. 
  Oh, thank God. 
  Let's get out of here. 
  Oh, what fun it is to Son of a bitch. 
  Whoa. 
  The devil is a lot smaller than I thought he was. 
  - How did this happen? 
  - Ambush. 
  And until they can get Ollerman out of here, our orders are to question him on site, see what he knows. 
  Susan, you're up. 
  Interrogation room. 
  Let's go. 
  And if he moves, shoot him. 
  This is my chance for revenge. 
  I'm-a rip his tooth out. 
  Nobody's ripping anything. 
  Hey, man, wasn't your tooth a fake? 
  We've already been over this. 
  - It was very traumatic and very painful! 
  - Ooh. 
  Look, we all need to know not to talk about Ollerman to anyone. 
  Especially not Ray. 
  He cannot know that he's here. 
  Oh, that's right. 
  Ollerman shot him. 
  Yeah, it was bad. 
  There were a couple nights I was sitting in his hospital room, I didn't think he was gonna make it. 
  Hold on. 
  You You were at Ray's bedside? 
  - Does he know that? 
  - No. 
  Is he ever going to? 
  What do you think? 
  I'm guessing "no. 
  " Guys, I need you back here. 
  That was fast, Suze. 
  He says he won't talk to me. 
  He'll only talk to you two. 
  All right. 
  Let's go. 
  So, was it this tooth right here? 
  This one? 
  Huh? 
  There you are. 
  I hear you requested us? 
  Oh, no offense to Susan, I just feel like the three of us - have more chemistry. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Guys, keep him relaxed. 
  We need him to feel comfortable. 
  Start by being overly friendly. 
  I'd like to put a bullet in that smug face of yours. 
  Why do I even bother? 
  - I mean, we were all thinking it. 
  - Yeah, but All right, let's start with an easy question. 
  How did your people know which route our convoy was gonna take? 
  I must say, you two are adorable together. 
  The suppressed sexual tension. 
  It's all right there, below the surface. 
  We know you're a member of The Trust. 
  We have intel that something big is coming. 
  - Talk. 
  - Funny, isn't it? 
  Your little team was put together because of me. 
  Now I'm gonna tear you apart. 
  Yeah, that's not gonna happen. 
  You're very confident for a man who officially reported Agent Trowbridge as "dangerously unstable and potentially disloyal. 
  " We had just met. 
  And in my defense it was true. 
  Fair point. 
  Then you joined forces with Jai Datta, Edgar Standish, and the infamous Dr. 
  Susan Sampson. 
  Agent Datta I'm surprised you're even still with them. 
  I believe your dossier said, "Subject is prone to isolation, rejects intimacy, and lacks the ability to connect with teammates in any meaningful way. 
  " Susan, you're the author. 
  Did I get your words right? 
  Seriously? 
  How does he know all of this? 
  Enough. 
  We're here to talk about The Trust. 
  Speaking of trust Edgar. 
  About your girlfriend, Agent Marek. 
  Please be something good. 
  Please be something good. 
  She's on a mission that requires a certain degree of erotic flexibility. 
  Do you think your insecurity will drive you to do something stupid and impulsive, given your propensity to self-sabotage? 
  Probably. 
  Yeah. 
  I wouldn't start with me. 
  I've had a day. 
  There she is! 
  The ruthless assassin. 
  I'm so glad you didn't follow through with that kill order. 
  Oh, you didn't know? 
  When you two first met, she had clearance to "tie up loose ends" and kill you. 
  Let me clarify she asked her superiors for permission to kill you and got it. 
  You're lucky she got shot, or you probably wouldn't be with us. 
  I'm sorry, I've been doing so much talking. 
  Is there any way I could get a glass of water? 
  Sure thing. 
  I hope no one spits in it. 
  It was a preliminary profile. 
  You've changed so much since then. 
  I will let you know when we are speaking again. 
  Okay. 
  All the imaginary scenarios of what Tina is doing right now are running through my head, and they're all erotic and flexible. 
  - Very flexible. 
  - Standish We've only kissed. 
  I haven't even seen her naked yet. 
  That's not fair, right? 
  Guys, please. 
  Look, this is what Ollerman does, okay? 
  He identifies and exploits your insecurities. 
  Do not let it get to you, okay? 
  Look, do I wish that Frankie hadn't planned my assassination? 
  Of course I do. 
  Who wouldn't? 
  But I'm not gonna sit here and let it dwell on me. 
  No, because it was Moscow, it was winter, and we were all cranky. 
  Eventually, I'm gonna need a better explanation than that. 
  Will is right. 
  We can deal with this. 
  As a team, we are that strong. 
  As long as we remember who we are, we got this. 
  That's right. 
  All right. 
  Let's get on it, okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Incoming. 
  All right. 
  Do not tell Ray. 
  - What? 
  - There's my team! 
  Hey, hey, got good news the Dutch analyst brought a karaoke machine. 
  Bad news it's all in Dutch. 
  Where are they going? 
  What were you guys just talking about? 
  Uh What we should be talking about is that empty glass. 
  No bueno. 
  Right? 
  You feel me? 
  Mnh-mnh. 
  I do. 
  Ray Ray! 
  I stashed a-a bottle of bourbon under the coffee machine. 
  - Huh? 
  - Huh? 
  - Huh? 
  - Huh? 
  - Huh? 
  - Huh? 
  Yeah. 
  Mission accepted, fellas. 
  Ray is on the job. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah, who's on the job? 
  That's an easy one. 
  It's Ray! 
  Hey. 
  Yeah. 
  Oh, God. 
  - Nice job. 
  - Thank you. 
  Should we chest bump? 
  That is unacceptable for me. 
  - Subtle fist pound? 
  - Absolutely. 
  What the hell are you doing? 
  I'm looking for something that starts with a "B" and ends with an "urban. 
  " And I can drink it. 
  It's bourbon. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, I managed to decipher your brilliant riddle. 
  - Oh, wow. 
  - What? 
  Apparently, they just brought a new prisoner in. 
  - Hmm. 
  - Alex Ollerman. 
  you a Merry Christmas Did you just say Ollerman? 
  And a Happy New Year Yeah. 
  Why? 
  Do you know him? 
  And a Happy New Year The Trust. 
  Your next attack. 
  I want a date and a location. 
  You know I can't tell you that. 
  So, come on, let's hear it. 
  How much ripple effect did I cause for team Whiskey? 
  Be honest. 
  He'll know if you aren't. 
  Well, we didn't exactly have a group hug afterwards, but we're we're still pretty solid. 
  - Good, good. 
  - Yeah. 
  I'm not gonna say it again stop stonewalling. 
  Look, you know she's right. 
  They've got you on treason and murder. 
  The only real choice you have is a gas chamber or lethal injection. 
  And either way, we're gonna make sure that your wife and son have a front-row seat. 
  Alex, do yourself and your family a favor. 
  Help us help you. 
  Look, talk, and I promise you'll avoid the death penalty. 
  You know me I always keep my word. 
  You do. 
  It's endearing. 
  Fine. 
  Here's what I know. 
  Ray. 
  Ray, stop. 
  Ray. 
  Hey, Ray. 
  Hey. 
  - Ray! 
  - Hey, hey. 
  - Aah! 
  - Hey, hey, stop it. 
  Look at me. 
  Look at me. 
  Not this way. 
  Come on. 
  Get out of here. 
  Enjoy the show, Susan? 
  This isn't going to end the way you want it to, Alex. 
  You never know. 
  If I had my gun, I would've shot him in his smug face! 
  Damn, Ray. 
  First time you looked attractive. 
  Hey, not helping. 
  Look, you need to cool down. 
  Just calm down. 
  Sit down, okay? 
  Hey, do you remember that mission we were on together in Brussels? 
  Do you remember what you said to me? 
  Crepes are just really thin pancakes. 
  No. 
  I mean, yes. 
  Yes, they are. 
  But I'm talking about when the mission went south, when good people got hurt, and when I totally lost my cool. 
  What did you say? 
  I told you not to lose sight of the big picture. 
  Hmm? 
  We're saving lives here, Ray. 
  Okay? 
  No matter what happens, you have to keep your head in the game. 
  Copy that. 
  All right. 
  Cool off, come on. 
  When he gets like this, he can go right off the rails. 
  We can't leave him alone. 
  Way ahead of you. 
  Got your text. 
  We need you to babysit Ray. 
  No, no, no, no. 
  Keep him calm. 
  Be there for him. 
  Look, this is a bad idea. 
  You heard Ollerman. 
  I'm terrible with people. 
  You know what? 
  Enough of this crap, Jai. 
  Who'd you get for Secret Santa? 
  I don't want to say. 
  Seriously? 
  Fine, it was Will. 
  I got you a hat. 
  - A hat? 
  - See? 
  E-Exactly. 
  It's an antique British bowler. 
  I thought you might like it because it's symbolic of what it means to be a gentleman, which I think you So stupid. 
  Stupid, Jai. 
  No, no. 
  Jai, hey! 
  Come on. 
  That's not stupid. 
  That's very, first of all, complimentary, and it's perfect, it's thoughtful, it's unique. 
  I can't wait to wear it. 
  See? 
  You know him. 
  You can connect with people. 
  Jai, you have come so far. 
  Thank you. 
  Just keep an eye on him, okay? 
  You're not gonna wear that goofy hat, are you? 
  No. 
  What do you want me to say, though? 
  I mean a British bowler? 
  Deck the halls with Deck the halls with boughs of holly La la la la la, la la la la Hey, guys, I think I got something. 
  I sat down at this computer to get some work done. 
  What were you really doing? 
  Okay, fine, I was trying to hack the phone systems to delete my voicemail to Tina. 
  - You happy? 
  - Very rarely. 
  I can confirm that. 
  I can appreciate you both. 
  Like I said, I came here to undo my "self-sabotaging tendencies," and I think I found a breach in the firewall. 
  Someone's trying to hack the security system. 
  What, on the same day our guest arrived? 
  That can't be a coincidence. 
  I think you're right. 
  The only thing is, the entry seems to be coming from inside the Hive. 
  Someone here is working with Ollerman. 
  Keep digging. 
  Find out who. 
  All right, mole. 
  Where's your hole? 
  Some team. 
  Couldn't even deliver my glass of water. 
  I know that you think that you're in control, that you're getting to us. 
  You're not. 
  Oh, I don't know. 
  Ray seemed pretty "gotten to. 
  " And I'm betting the other members of the team are all spinning like little tops. 
  Enough. 
  Let's get to The Trust. 
  No. 
  It's been fun, but that little part of our Q&A is over. 
  So now's the part where I hurt you until you talk? 
  No, I feel like there are probably some other options we should exhaust first. 
  Susan, you want to come in here? 
  Susan? 
  I'm afraid she's not there. 
  Will. 
  You're probably gonna want to answer that. 
  It's an important call. 
  Will? 
  Su Now, how about you two uncuff me and get me my damn water? 
  I feel like you're making a really big deal over a stapler, Todd. 
  Oh, my gosh, yes, you're absolutely right. 
  Here, let me just release you. 
  Or maybe I should just keep you here until Ollerman tells me to kill you. 
  Which I will enjoy. 
  Ohh, yeah. 
 
 
 
  Now new plan. 
  I am gonna walk out of here, or Dr. 
  Sampson dies. 
  Yeah, that's not gonna happen. 
  I'm gonna need some new clothes, a gun. 
  Also gonna need my ring from the evidence locker. 
  Family heirloom. 
  I'm sentimental. 
  You orchestrated this whole thing. 
  Our team doing the pick-up, the sniper it was all you. 
  I'd hurry. 
  Susan's life is on the line. 
  Tick tock, agents. 
  This is all my fault. 
  If I hadn't lost my cool, he wouldn't have a chance to grab her. 
  Look, we don't have time for that, all right? 
  As soon as Ollerman leaves the building, Susan's dead. 
  Okay. 
  What's the plan? 
  Find the mole, save Susan. 
  Standish, how we doing? 
  Dude, I'm running a tracer app that cross-references the signal against all time-stamped user logins in the last 24 hours, - but it's gonna take some time. 
  - Okay, I didn't understand any of that, but go faster. 
  We'll try and stall Ollerman. 
  All right, let's do this. 
  I'm looking at CCTV footage of every camera around the building. 
  They're all disabled. 
  Did you check the internal cameras? 
  Yeah, it's shut off, too. 
  Don't you dream of spending Christmas Ray. 
  We're doing everything we can, man. 
  Yeah, well, we got to do more. 
  It's Todd. 
  I've been digging through the mainframe, and the hack traces back to his computer. 
  He is the one that told me about Ollerman. 
  He had an alert on his smart watch. 
  He has a smart watch. 
  Amateur. 
  All right, I'll be able to track that signal. 
  Get going. 
  I'll send you guys the coordinates. 
  Look, Ollerman's smart. 
  He's not gonna let us stall much longer. 
  We've got to come up with a plan. 
  He wants to break this team apart, right? 
  What if we let him? 
  What if we make him think one of us has turned? 
  Right now, it's the best we've got. 
  I'll do it, yeah. 
  You go dark? 
  Nobody would believe it. 
  You've probably never even stolen a pack of gum. 
  Hey, I've stolen a pack of gum. 
  - Really? 
  - Yes! 
  I went back and paid for it, but Look. 
  You said it yourself I'm dangerously unstable and potentially disloyal. 
  No, that was early on. 
  You know that things have changed now. 
  I do. 
  But Ollerman doesn't. 
  All he knows is you can only tell the truth. 
  All right, what are you thinking? 
  Before I tell you, do you trust me completely? 
  Is this about the guy in the bathtub again? 
  'Cause that was weird. 
  Will, do you trust me with your life? 
  My life? 
  That's a a bit of a leap, but I do. 
  Yeah. 
  What's the plan? 
  My ring? 
  You really love this gaudy little thing, don't you? 
  And using your family motto as the codename for your secret evil operation? 
  Tell me, is everyone in The Trust that stupid? 
  Give it to me. 
  Oh, nice trick. 
  What is that? 
  A microchip with encrypted data records. 
  Worth billions in secret bank accounts. 
  Billions? 
  So this whole thing was about money? 
  Money is a means to an end. 
  Our goal is instability. 
  Chaos. 
  Destroy the established order, and all the power and wealth is just there for the taking. 
  The Trust isn't just planning one attack. 
  We're planning dozens. 
  But scale begets cost. 
  Ambition isn't cheap. 
  Yeah, you can't exactly crowd fund terrorism. 
  But with this, we're back in business. 
  Thanks to you. 
  I want in. 
  Frankie, what are you talking about? 
  Come on, you knew this was gonna happen sooner or later. 
  I mean, according to him, you wrote it down. 
  No. 
  No, I'm not gonna let you do this. 
  I'd like to see you stop me. 
  I'll stop you if I have to. 
  What are you talking about?! 
  Guys, guys. 
  Sorry. 
  I'm not buying it. 
  I would be an asset to you, and you know it. 
  I don't care who I work for. 
  As long as the checks clear. 
  Frankie, come on! 
  What are you doing?! 
  Prove it. 
  Frankie, what are you doing? 
  No, don't prove anything. 
  Frankie, put that away. 
  Ow! 
  Ohh! 
  God! 
  Frankie! 
  Ohh! 
  Happy? 
  Not really. 
  He's still breathing. 
  Frankie. 
  Aah. 
  Ohh. 
  Maybe people don't change, Will. 
  Are you crazy? 
  Aah! 
  I believe I asked for a gun? 
  All right, then. 
  Shall we? 
  Will! 
  You got shot?! 
  How did Ollerman get a gun? 
  Grab the chair. 
  Ohh. 
  He didn't shoot me. 
  Frankie did. 
  I have so many questions. 
  We agreed she'd shoot me to prove she turned. 
  That second one, that took me by surprise. 
  Oh, God. 
  That answers none of my questions. 
  Frankie's got great aim. 
  This one's a through-and-through, the second one's just a graze. 
  Hey, did you find Susan? 
  Yeah the data center nearby. 
  Jai and Ray are en route. 
  Are you sure you're okay? 
  'Cause that's a lot of blood, and I'm a little light-headed. 
  Guys, we're at Susan's location. 
  Is she okay? 
  We don't know. 
  We think she's with multiple hostiles. 
  We'll do a little recon, put together a plan of attack. 
  Yeah, look, Ollerman's on his way out. 
  It's now or never. 
  You got to go. 
  That doesn't sound like a great idea, man. 
  No, it's not. 
  It's not, Ray, but I know you can do this. 
  Ray, look You're one of the best field agents I've ever worked with. 
  I can't count the number of times you saved my ass. 
  I mean, sometimes it didn't seem like you knew what the hell you were doing. 
  'Cause I didn't. 
  Yes, exactly, Ray. 
  That's your superpower. 
  You know how to improvise, all right? 
  Now just go save Susan. 
  Okay. 
  Um When you hear shots, come in hot. 
  What are you gonna do? 
  I don't know. 
  Okay. 
  Hey, party people! 
  What's up? 
  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
  Easy, easy, easy, easy. 
  Hey, hey, fellas. 
  Loosen up a little bit, okay? 
  In through the nose, out through the mouth, especially this guy. 
  Henchman of the year. 
  Todd! 
  Good news. 
  Ollerman's got the ring, and he's on his way out. 
  I kind of messed up. 
  I asked him if he could grab some beers if we finished early. 
  He got mad, gave me those crazy eyes you know the ones. 
  I know you know 'em because you're always pushing his buttons. 
  'Cause you're a rascal. 
  Since when did you become a part of this? 
  When Th That That's a funny, funny story. 
  I didn't. 
  Don't come any closer. 
  I'll kill her! 
  Todd, do the math, buddy, okay? 
  It's two against one. 
  Put your gun down. 
  Absolutely not. 
  If I put my gun down, you will just kill me. 
  You drop yours, or she dies. 
  Okay. 
  All right, you win. 
  All right? 
  I'll go first. 
  I'm putting it down. 
  Look at me. 
  Look at me. 
  Look at me. 
  I'm putting it down. 
  Look at me. 
  Look at me, Todd. 
  I'm doing it. 
  Should've watched us both, Todd. 
  Ohh! 
  Standish is gonna be so jealous I got to shoot Todd. 
  - Tell Will we got her. 
  - Yep. 
  Hey. 
  You okay? 
  Yeah. 
  Wow. 
  I really should've gotten you a Secret Santa present. 
  I did good, right? 
  You did great, Ray. 
  All right. 
  Let's go. 
  Curbside pickup. 
  Is that a perk of the job? 
  I'm not an idiot. 
  I trained people like you. 
  You didn't turn. 
  I saw you look back at Chase. 
  You can't hide how much you care about him. 
  Thanks for all your help. 
  It's been fun finally getting to know you. 
  Bad news, Alex. 
  We got Susan. 
  No hostage, no leverage. 
  Isn't this fun? 
  Unfortunately for you, one person here doesn't have a gun. 
  No matter how this plays out, I'm putting a bullet between your eyes. 
  And you know me. 
  You decide if I'm telling the truth or not. 
  I believe him. 
  Tell you what. 
  Her life for mine. 
  Deal. 
  No deal! 
  He didn't ask you. 
  Well, I feel like I have a say in the matter. 
  Well, feel like that all you want. 
  Been great catching up. 
  Till next time. 
  You let him get away with the microchip. 
  The Trust is gonna be completely funded again. 
  No, it isn't. 
  Ollerman was never a sentimental type. 
  I knew he wouldn't care about some stupid piece of jewelry unless it was important, so I switched it out. 
  Probably should've told you. 
  So what did you put on it instead? 
  Photos of me at Disneyland. 
  My friends and I were on Splash Mountain. 
  We were playing chess. 
  He probably won't appreciate the bit, - but, you know. 
  - I do. 
  Thank you. 
  Ow. 
  I can't believe you shot me. 
  Oh, suck it up. 
  You said it was okay. 
  Maybe slow down. 
  Come on. 
  Ow! 
  God! 
  Allo, Guv'na! 
  I'm so glad you like it. 
  Yeah, I can't help it. 
  It's growing on me. 
  Hey, I, uh I want to make a toast. 
  Ah, but, uh, Ollerman got away. 
  I thought you only toasted to successful missions. 
  What's with Agent Buzzkill? 
  Ray, we'll get him, okay? 
  I promise. 
  Besides, I wasn't, uh I wasn't gonna toast the mission. 
  I wanted to raise a glass to this team. 
  Ollerman really tested us. 
  But nothing in this world can break us apart. 
  That's right. 
  - Mm. 
  - Cheers. 
  Cheers. 
  I'm your Secret Santa. 
  I brought you this from Miami. 
  Oh, Cuban rum. 
  And the good kind. 
  This was more than 30 bucks. 
  Least I could do. 
  I mean, after you called me to tell me how much you missed me Oh, so you got the message. 
  This must be goodbye rum. 
  No. 
  I thought it was sweet. 
  Look, this is all new for me, but I will figure it out. 
  I promise. 
  They know that Santa's on his way Do you need to know what happened with the guy in Miami? 
  I don't know. 
  Do I? 
  No. 
  Okay. 
  Miami. 
  Never going there. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  How you doing? 
  Good. 
  Better. 
  I knew you guys would come through for me, so Well, I mean, there was talk about leaving you there. 
  You know what you have to do. 
  You're right. 
  Although it's been said Hey, Ray. 
  I just wanted to say, uh you did an awesome job. 
  Thanks, man. 
  Means a lot. 
  Good. 
  Hey, man.

  Happy SHEP.

  This is appropriate. 
  Can we, uh Okay. 
  Yeah, that's nice. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Easy.

  I'm offering this simple phrase We never finished our game.
