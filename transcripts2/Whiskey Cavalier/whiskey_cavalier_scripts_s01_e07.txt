  Hello. 
  Emma Davies, MI6. 
  You must be Agent Trowbridge. 
  And Agent Chase? 
  Yes. 
  Interesting. 
  Not really. 
  Uh hello. 
  [GRUNTING] 
  I can't believe that hot girl kicked all our asses. 
  - The what? 
  - What, now? 
  What took you so long? 
  WILL: So, we're supposed to believe that you're Tina Marek from Brooklyn. 
  I'm CIA. 
  I've been given the freedom to operate under deep cover for years. 
  So, it looks like Tina is on our side. 
  Yes! 
  New team member! 
  What's up?! 
  Good to see you, Emma. 
  You too. 
  I think she's a good match for Will. 
  Look at you, being the bigger person. 
  I mean, it's not like Will and I were ever together. 
  Why does this keep happening? 
  Hm. 
  I kind of like it. 
  Have I made it clear that I really like you? 
  Well, just remind me. 
  - Okay. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  FRANKIE: She's great. 
  Don't screw it up. 
  [MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS] 
  [LAUGHTER, INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  Jimmy Coleman. 
  Congratulations, my friend. 
  Will Chase. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Eh? 
  Last time I saw you was It's been a lifetime, man. 
  Eh, uniform still fits, though, huh? 
  Does it? 
  [LAUGHS] 
  You look good. 
  Older, but Thank you. 
  You too. 
  Thank you. 
  You know, given, uh Given the way you used to roll, I'm surprised you actually made it to retirement. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah, I've been lucky. 
  You still pushing paper for the FBI? 
  Yeah. 
  You know, something like that. 
  Hey. 
  - Oohrah. 
  - Oohrah. 
  - [GLASSES THUD LIGHTLY] 
  - Ah. 
  So, what's next for Jimmy C? 
  Me? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Think I'm just gonna lay in a hammock and never get up. 
  Ohh. 
  Sounds great. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Put an offer in on this little house in the Keys. 
  Really? 
  Ah, come on. 
  I heard it was a 10,000-square-foot McMansion. 
  Right on the water? 
  [CLICKS TONGUE] 
  Sounds great. 
  How do you afford that? 
  Mm been saving my pennies. 
  Saving your pennies, yeah. 
  That's a lot of pennies. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Wow. 
  So, you're not just gonna sell that plutonium you stole, huh? 
  Brother, if you're here to try to take me down [ZZ TOP'S "LA GRANGE" PLAYS] 
  I hope you're not alone. 
  Hm. 
  Me too. 
  Hey, two more. 
  Sir, if this guy's giving you any trouble, just give me the word and I'll shoot him. 
  Oh. 
  - I like her. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  It's always nice to have friends around. 
  Right, guys? 
  Mm, yeah. 
  [GLASS THUDS] 
  It's always good seeing you, Will. 
  [COUGHS, GROANS] 
  [WILL GRUNTS] 
  [GROANS] 
  Did you tag him? 
  Yeah, I tagged him. 
  He's got a micro-tracker. 
  Oh, my nose is fine. 
  Thank you for asking. 
  I don't think he has any idea we let him go. 
  No, no, it was totally worth getting disfigured. 
  Come on. 
  What? 
  Is it bad? 
  Is it bad? 
  - No. 
  No, it's fine. 
  - I need to see this. 
  Come on, it's Ooh. 
  Yeah, he is busted. 
  I need to know now Know now Can you love me again? 
  I need to know now Know now Can you love me again? 
  Can you love me again? 
  Nice. 
  Hey, party people! 
  Jai's nose is different. 
  See? 
  You lied to me. 
  It is bad. 
  Why did you lie? 
  You You fix my face, Ray. 
  Fix it! 
  Whew. 
  Well, the tracker's working. 
  RAY: Yeah, Will, you were right. 
  Jimmy's gonna lead us right to the plutonium. 
  Oh, I'm dying to put this guy away. 
  Look at you, hating on somebody. 
  I like it. 
  No. 
  Come on. 
  I don't hate him. 
  I just want his life to be over painfully. 
  Yeah, there it is. 
  I met Jimmy during my second tour in Iraq. 
  [INDISTINCT TALKING] 
  He was a great marine But an even better hustler. 
  From the moment he was in-country, he was dealing in contraband, and nobody could ever pin anything on him, right? 
  So [INHALES DEEPLY] 
  I confronted him. 
  He did not love what I had to say. 
  While we were on patrol, our Humvee came under friendly fire From Jimmy's unit. 
  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
  Somehow, Jimmy was cleared of all wrongdoing. 
  So, for the past 16 years, he's been rising through the ranks of the Corps, padding his pockets, and getting away with it. 
  Well, Jimmy's luck just ran out. 
  He missed a CCTV camera that caught him stealing the plutonium core that he was supposed to be transporting. 
  I can see why you hate him. 
  No, I don't Oh, I hate him. 
  I hate him so much! 
  - Yes! 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  Hey, guys, Will's got a nemesis, and it's not me for once. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Um but that's not important. 
  What is important is that we track Jimmy to Spain with enough plutonium to take out an entire city. 
  Your mission is to retrieve that plutonium before he can sell it. 
  You leave in an hour. 
  - Any questions? 
  - STANDISH: Yeah. 
  When do I get a nemesis? 
  'Cause that sounds really cool. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  It's like a nickname. 
  You can't force it. 
  Oh, come on. 
  Oh! 
  Will, Will! 
  Will, Will, Will, Will! 
  Great news. 
  Look, since the plutonium was boosted from the UK, MI6 wants to send an agent along, so I suggested Drum roll, please. 
  No, let me do it. 
  [IMITATING DRUM ROLL] 
  Emma Davies! 
  Tsssssssssssssssh! 
  You arranged to have my girlfriend go on a mission with Frankie and me? 
  W I didn't "arrange" it. 
  I just, uh, pulled some strings. 
  How many strings, Ray? 
  Like a thousand. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  But that smile on your face makes it all worth it. 
  [CLICKS TONGUE] 
  You're not smiling. 
  Mm. 
  But you will be, because Emma's gonna love it. 
  No, she won't. 
  I can't believe this. 
  You had me pulled off my mission and put onto yours. 
  No, it wasn't me. 
  It was Ray's idea. 
  So what did you do when he told you? 
  Well, I didn't smile. 
  That's for sure. 
  Oh, come on. 
  We barely get to see each other. 
  All right? 
  Spain, you, me. 
  Imagine these emerald beauties in the Spanish light. 
  MÃ¡s verde. 
  - Yes, mÃ¡s verde. 
  - Yes. 
  That's not really the point. 
  Look, if you want to be angry with Ray, I'm cool with that I'm not angry with Ray. 
  I'm angry with you. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Well, that just doesn't make any sense. 
  You didn't say to Ray that my job is just as important to me as yours is to you. 
  You didn't You didn't have him undo this immediately. 
  You didn't do anything, did you? 
  Did I mention the "not smiling"? 
  'Cause I didn't smile. 
  I don't want to be put on an assignment because I'm someone's girlfriend. 
  I want to be put on an assignment because I'm the best agent for the job. 
  Yes. 
  Can't you be both? 
  Okay. 
  I-I'll see you when you get back. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Emma. 
  Jimmy's still in Madrid, but his tracker's on the move. 
  He'll eventually stop and hole up somewhere. 
  Direct a satellite overheard to get a better look. 
  [KEYS CLACKING] 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Can I help you? 
  is your name Todd McManus? 
  No. 
  Oh! 
  Shoot. 
  Oh, sorry. 
  I was just asking because I'm Todd. 
  And this is my desk. 
  Oh. 
  My bad, bro. 
  But I've been working at this desk for a while now. 
  'Course you have. 
  Because I went on a sabbatical, and you just swoop in and take whatever you want. 
  Because that's what Americans do, isn't it? 
  [AMERICAN ACCENT] 
  "Oh! 
  Oh, my God! 
  Whoa! 
  I didn't see those there. 
  Are they potato chips? 
  I'm hungry. 
  Oh, look. 
  I think these are mine now. 
  " Would you like a chip? 
  [CRUNCHES] 
  [NORMAL VOICE] 
  I'll be seeing ya. 
  Nemesis! 
  This Portable Geiger counter. 
  Measures radiation to the smallest level anywhere. 
  These are your containment vessels. 
  You can say "backpack. 
  " I could but I won't. 
  Now, once you get the plutonium core, you put it inside the containment vessel. 
  It'll stabilize, but the core is extremely dangerous. 
  It's deadly. 
  WILL: Copy that Don't break the core unless we want everyone around us to die. 
  Yeah. 
  Speaking of dying, I'm gonna go take some meds For my face. 
  Angry. 
  Where's Emma? 
  She's not coming. 
  Uh-oh. 
  Someone's in trouble? 
  No. 
  No. 
  No, I'm not in trouble. 
  - Mm - He's in so much trouble. 
  Because you roped your girlfriend into our mission? 
  It wasn't me. 
  It was Ray. 
  Mm, but she's not mad at Ray, is she? 
  No, of course not. 
  Nobody's ever mad at Ray. 
  I just I don't know what the big deal is. 
  - You want this? 
  - No. 
  You take it. 
  No, go ahead. 
  Will, Ray made your job more important than hers, and you didn't stop it. 
  Without going through the history of women's struggles, I'm sure you can see how she would feel let down by that. 
  Yes, I can see how she would feel let down by that. 
  Uh, yo, the tracker stopped, and I got a location. 
  It's an abandoned bunker near the mountains. 
  I'm sending the coordinates now. 
  All right, great. 
  Let's head out. 
  And Emma will be fine. 
  Start with a gift Bottle of Malbec. 
  Or one of Jimmy's ears. 
  I'd find that romantic. 
  Foul shot form There we go. 
  All right. 
  Ooh, game time. 
  Here we go crossover. 
  Ah, ah! 
  Step back! 
  Three! 
  Oh, sorry. 
  Sorry. 
  Sorry! 
  Sorry. 
  Sorry. 
  - I'm not gonna hit you. 
  - Okay. 
  You playing coffee basketball? 
  Yeah. 
  No. 
  But, like, yeah. 
  Hot cocoa basketball. 
  Oh. 
  Can I have one? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Thanks. 
  So, you're, like, uh here. 
  Oh, the CIA assigned me here, so this office is gonna be my new home base. 
  Oh. 
  Cool. 
  I mean, not this home office. 
  I'm in the east wing. 
  Y-You don't have access. 
  No, no, I don't. 
  But it's cool, you know. 
  It's cool. 
  But, you know, if you're ever in the mood for something stronger than cocoa [CHUCKLES] 
  I would be down for a drink. 
  Cool. 
  Cool. 
  What?! 
  We're in. 
  Satellite footage is picking up a heat signature. 
  Jimmy and his Mercs are definitely in there with the core. 
  Okay, I'm counting multiple hostiles. 
  - Copy that. 
  We'll load up. 
  - [GUN COCKS] 
  Hey, you guys remember that totally psycho but very hot agent Tina? 
  Wait, the one who tried to kill us all? 
  Yeah. 
  I think she just asked me out. 
  Sweetie, are you sure? 
  You've made this mistake before. 
  No. 
  I-I know. 
  I know. 
  I thought the same thing. 
  But she just texted this. 
  "Drinks tonight Question mark. 
  " [CHUCKLES] 
  All right. 
  What's she like? 
  You know, when she's not assaulting fellow agents. 
  Oh. 
  Intimidating. 
  Lavender-scented. 
  I could barely talk to her. 
  It was like I was having a bunch of mini-strokes. 
  Ohh! 
  [GEIGER COUNTER BUZZING SOFTLY] 
  Hey, you think I should call Emma? 
  Nah, we're in a bunker No service. 
  Funny. 
  You know what I mean. 
  Let her cool off. 
  Right. 
  Yeah, no, when she wants to talk, she'll talk. 
  - And you'll listen. 
  - Yeah. 
  And apologize. 
  Because you're you, you'll actually mean it. 
  Well, who apologizes when they don't mean it? 
  Everyone else on Earth. 
  That's a blast door. 
  Yeah, we're not getting through that. 
  Unh-unh. 
  It was built to withstand an A-Bomb. 
  That wasn't. 
  Now let's see who comes running. 
  Oh. 
  [ALARM BEEPING] 
  You guys just stay here, be comfortable. 
  I'll go check it out. 
  What are you idiots? 
  Go check it out now! 
  [DOOR CREAKING, MEN GRUNTING] 
  All right, just choke them out. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Why do you make everything so complicated? 
  I don't know. 
  Oh. 
  Nice. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Company. 
  Let me guess Micro-tracker? 
  The little guy who I headbutted? 
  Ah, well. 
  I suppose you're looking for this. 
  FRANKIE: Hm. 
  [BEEP, CRACKLING] 
  Why don't you hand it over so you and Will can hug it out? 
  I don't think so. 
  No. 
  You're gonna have to shoot me. 
  Not a problem. 
  Seriously? 
  I know you better than that, Will. 
  If you shoot this, then your bartender friend over there is gonna die with the rest of us, and you're Mister Morals, so Will! 
  Geiger counter said it was a decoy. 
  Get down! 
  - [GUNFIRE] 
  - Okay, take this. 
  Go find the core. 
  It's gotta be around here somewhere. 
  - Cover me. 
  - Ready? 
  Go! 
  [SCREAMS] 
  [GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE] 
  [GEIGER COUNTER CRACKLING] 
  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. 
  - [GEIGER COUNTER BEEPS] 
  - Will, I've got something! 
  WILL: Good, 'cause I'm outnumbered! 
  [GUNSHOTS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  Never mind. 
  Depleted uranium rounds. 
  I'll keep looking. 
  [GUNFIRE] 
  Yeah, sure. 
  Take your time. 
  [GEIGER COUNTER CRACKLING] 
  [GEIGER COUNTER BEEPS] 
  [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  [GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE] 
  Will, I got it. 
  Frankie, come on! 
  [BUZZER] 
  Had to try. 
  Good seeing you around, buddy. 
  See you soon. 
  That's Jimmy's truck. 
  Let's move! 
  [KEYS JINGLE] 
  [ENGINE STALLS, HIGH-PITCHED WHINING] 
  Hey, we got to go. 
  [RAPID BEEPING] 
  Go. 
  Come on, go. 
  He wired the truck! 
  What? 
  He booby-trapped his own truck? 
  Jimmy's idea of a car alarm. 
  Doesn't seem like that kind of neighborhood. 
  Well, he likes to cover his bases. 
  He'll be expecting us to go to the extraction point. 
  All right, then let's do the opposite. 
  Hey, guys, we're going off-grid. 
  We'll need a new extraction plan, staying clear of the roads. 
  Hold on. 
  Let me see what I can do. 
  [SNIFFS] 
  I know this isn't ideal, but hiking in Spain? 
  It's kind of my dream vacation. 
  [TO TUNE OF "HAPPY TOGETHER"] 
  Y quiero al despertir sentir Tu corazÃ³n Que hermoso debe ser vivir Una pasiÃ³n Los dos tan felices Siempre juntos Con nuestro amor Este amor de juventud You know, Susan was right. 
  This is, uh, actually kind of fun. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Yeah, I love when I see my breath. 
  It takes my mind off the shivering. 
  Could you try to be positive, please? 
  I only have a tiny bit of hypothermia. 
  Well, I tweaked my shoulder at the bunker. 
  And I'm carrying radioactive material. 
  Whoo-hoo! 
  SUSAN: Smart move going into the woods. 
  Jimmy and his men have covered every road in and out. 
  Okay, satellite imaging shows a structure three klicks ahead. 
  WILL: Copy that. 
  We're on our way there now. 
  Ba, ba, ba, ba Ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba ba Ba-ba-ba, ba I can't wait to spend the night in some filthy, freezing shed. 
  Ba-ba-ba, ba [CHUCKLES] 
  That's quite a shed. 
  I bet they have so many blankets. 
  STANDISH: Huh. 
  Nice house. 
  I hacked the utility records. 
  Looks like it's only open on the weekends. 
  Oh. 
  And the owners work in the city, so it should work out great. 
  [LOCK CLICKING] 
  Good in the den. 
  All right, I'm checking out the kitchen. 
  [BOTTLES CLINK] 
  Wait. 
  We've got a situation. 
  A delicious situation. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Dork. 
  Ohh. 
  Scanning the perimeter for a bottle opener. 
  - Copy that. 
  - SUSAN: Copy. 
  You should be safe there. 
  We'll monitor any movements until dawn. 
  Hey, get some sleep. 
  We'll have an extraction plan for you then. 
  Copy. 
  Let's find that bottle opener. 
  JAI: Stand by for satellite. 
  Okay. 
  Satellite images shows no heat signature anywhere near the house. 
  Why are you pacing? 
  Because I keep obsessing over this date with Tina. 
  I tried to plan it out using an algorithm, but every time I run the scenario, she leaves in under six minutes. 
  Okay. 
  You're having some confidence issues. 
  We can get you psychologically past that. 
  It's what I do. 
  Really? 
  Of course! 
  Okay. 
  I need y'all to keep it real with me. 
  Is she way out of my league? 
  I'll answer that for every woman on Earth. 
  Yes. 
  He's actually a really good nemesis. 
  Ooh! 
  Ooh! 
  They've got fig jam! 
  I have never heard anyone say that with so much excitement. 
  Ohh! 
  Smell that. 
  - Right? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Ohh. 
  You know, agents don't usually get fig jam on mission. 
  Uh, yeah, well, agents don't normally wear slippers, either, but, uh [SNAPS FINGERS] 
  Okay, you have no idea how comfortable these are. 
  I'm not judging. 
  There's nothing we can do until morning, anyway. 
  Hey you ever just want to take a break from being a spy? 
  Like, hang out and be normal people? 
  Of course. 
  It just doesn't happen very often. 
  Look, we're off the grid, nobody knows where we are except our teammates. 
  What do you say? 
  I could say yes if we open another bottle of this? 
  Oh. 
  Way ahead of you. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Okay. 
  Welcome to the war room. 
  Ray, thank you for coming, even though no one asked you to. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Never too busy for you guys. 
  Okay. 
  Well, here is all the intel that we've gathered on Agent Tina Marek. 
  Now, obviously, she's a 10. 
  - Which makes me? 
  - A 9. 
  - 6 1/2. 
  - Soft 2. 
  He lives with his mom. 
  But not on the same floor. 
  We just share a bathroom. 
  Oh, I'd like to change my score to "negative pathetic. 
  " Mm. 
  How'd you guys get all this info, anyway? 
  Oh, we did what you couldn't. 
  We talked to her. 
  So, your parents are from Poland? 
  [SPEAKING POLISH] 
  But I grew up in Brighton Beach. 
  No! 
  I'm from Clinton Hill! 
  - [CHUCKLING] 
  Stop! 
  - [CHUCKLING] 
  Yeah! 
  If I knew you were from Brooklyn, I would've never choked you out like that. 
  Oh. 
  Yeah. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  So, you saw Wu Tang five times? 
  At the Garden. 
  It was so good. 
  You know, in Mandarin, "Wu Tang" means "five tang. 
  " You don't know who Wu Tang is, do you? 
  I have no idea. 
  I listen to show tunes. 
  No, Jai's straight. 
  Bummer. 
  I was gonna set him up with my friend Ken. 
  He's awesome. 
  You know who else is awesome? 
  That Standish guy. 
  Smart as a whip, so funny. 
  And he's, like, ripped! 
  I watch him work out all the time. 
  Would you like to meet Ken? 
  Yeah. 
  So, everything you need to know about Tina is in this Her personal history, her likes, her dislikes. 
  A whole dating dossier. 
  Yeah! 
  And you know what it says? 
  She's just a normal person, like anybody else. 
  So lose the insecurities! 
  Be confident! 
  Yeah, man. 
  You're gonna be great. 
  Fine. 
  Hey, relax. 
  These people believe in you. 
  Good enough. 
  - [CELLPHONE BUZZES] 
  - Ooh. 
  [GASPS] 
  I just got a text from Ken. 
  He's my friend. 
  [DR. 
  HOOK'S "SHARING THE NIGHT TOGETHER" PLAYS] 
  So then he goes for my gun, I shoot him in the gut and leave him for dead in Red Square. 
  Your breakups are terrifying. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  - [GROANS] 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Ooh. 
  I used to always go for the bad boys. 
  There was a time when I would've gone for your friend Jimmy. 
  You realize he's trying to kill us, right? 
  Yeah, I'm working on it. 
  [SNORTS] 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  - That's awful. 
  I'm feeling kinda lonely, too, if you don't mind Mmm. 
  - I'm proud of you. 
  - Why? 
  Drinking stolen wine. 
  Oh, well, I, uh, left a note on the table with some cash. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  "Gracias, este vino es muy bueno. 
  " - [LAUGHS] 
  - So it's it should get it. 
  I don't think I spelled it right. 
  Sorry.

  Sharing the night I know what you're gonna say You prefer shooting people.

  [CHUCKLING] 
  I know. 
  It's nice to have options, though.

  - Emma. 
  Wow. 
  Hi. 
  What are you doing here? 
  Well, since I was technically assigned to assist on this mission, MI6 has sent me in to help facilitate your extraction. 
  Oh. 
  You still have the plutonium? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah, we do. 
  Brilliant. 
  Right, well, um, now that's dealt with, um I also didn't like the way we left things in New York. 
  Uh, I-I reacted the way I did because I felt like you didn't seem to understand why I was upset. 
  No, you're right. 
  Um But I do now. 
  And I'm I'm sorry. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  And he means that. 
  Yeah. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Well, thank you. 
  Right, well, lucky for you two, I was the Madrid station chief for MI6, so I know this area inside out. 
  There is a train station 10 kilometers north from here. 
  We can use the train to get the plutonium core home and far from Jimmy's hands. 
  Sounds great. 
  That's perfect. 
  Yeah. 
  So, what have you two been doing to pass the time? 
  - Work stuff. 
  - Oh. 
  And fig jam. 
  Fig jam. 
  It's, uh I'll have to tell you that story. 
  Um You know, I'm gonna go wash up. 
  - Mm. 
  - Actually, I-I'll s I'm gonna I'll be right back. 
  Yep. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Cool gun. 
  Yes. 
  It is cool. 
  As are those slippers. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
 
 
 
  - Warm. 
  - Mm. 
  Not mine. 
  So, Emma has rendezvoused with Will and Frankie. 
  They have a new exit plan, and we have sent in support. 
  Yeah, great. 
  Standish is one minute out from his rendezvous with Tina. 
  Why am I more nervous about this mission? 
  Me too. 
  Gonna sing to myself to keep myself calm What's this? 
  It's that, my badass calming song Here we go I get it. 
  Standish is not her usual type. 
  I did some research, and she's really into, like, super-alpha dudes. 
  You didn't tell Standish that, did you? 
  Yeah. 
  Why? 
  [DEEE-LITE'S "GROOVE IS IN THE HEART" PLAYS] 
  [CHAINS RATTLE] 
  Dig! 
  Groove is in the heart Groove is in the heart Hey! 
  Look at you, with your fine ass. 
  Come here. 
  Mwah. 
  Groove is in the heart Yeah, take a seat. 
  Seat's been waiting for that booty. 
  Oh, wow, that's not good. 
  Now, I had the pleasure of ordering you a drink. 
  Oh. 
  I usually order my own drink. 
  Nah, I'm not I'm not with that. 
  When you're with me, I got you. 
  I'm gonna hurt you, Ray. 
  It's okay. 
  He c He can get this back. 
  - How is it? 
  - Mmm. 
  You're lucky. 
  I do love a vodka martini. 
  Now, that's Polish vodka From Poland. 
  Oh, my parents are from Poland. 
  Oh! 
  Hell yeah. 
  I love Poland. 
  Poland is my place. 
  I love Polish people and, specifically, their wood furniture. 
  They're the number-one exporter of wood furniture in all of Europe. 
  Classic. 
  I mean, everybody loves wood. 
  Top-notch. 
  I don't want to listen. 
  I just can't stop. 
  Oh, I've been to Poland. 
  You know, mainly for missions. 
  You know, a little "snatch and grab," a little hit job here and there. 
  But you know how that is the job. 
  I thought you were a tech guy 'til a few months ago. 
  That's just my cover. 
  I'm really a black-ops guy. 
  Little wet work, little dry work. 
  All types of work, really. 
  I'm gonna take his gun away now. 
  Full disclosure While we here [BROOKLYN ACCENT] 
  I'm originally from Brooklyn. 
  Where in Brooklyn? 
  [NORMAL VOICE] 
  Uh, n-nowhere. 
  E-Everywhere at the same time. 
  Know what I mean? 
  Like, for real, for real. 
  - Mm. 
  - Like, that sits in your blood. 
  - Like, my godfather is Biggie Smalls. 
  - I know. 
  Do you hear that? 
  I'm so sorry. 
  I got a text. 
  I have to go. 
  Where? 
  Anywhere, nowhere. 
  You know how it is, B. 
  All right. 
  I'll, uh see you at work. 
  Wow. 
  That was a complete disaster. 
  Why couldn't he just be himself? 
  [SIGHS] 
  [BLOWS] 
  All right, I I feel like we need to tell Emma what happened here. 
  Nothing happened. 
  We're two partners who had some wine and a very professional, necessary therapeutic massage. 
  Right Wine and a massage. 
  Still, it doesn't It doesn't doesn't feel right to keep it from her. 
  To keep what from her? 
  Seriously, Will? 
  What did you think was gonna happen if Emma hadn't shown up? 
  Nothing? 
  Exactly. 
  Don't make problems where there are none. 
  Right. 
  I - Hey. 
  - We ready to get going? 
  - [CELLPHONE BUZZING] 
  - Yeah Oh. 
  What is it? 
  It's Jimmy. 
  - [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
  - Hey. 
  What's up? 
  Hi, Will. 
  Catch you at a bad time? 
  No, pal, I'm free. 
  What's going on? 
  Listen, my foreign buyers are very wealthy. 
  [DOG BARKS] 
  And they really would like nuclear capability. 
  Yeah, look, they sound like great guys. 
  Ah, they're okay. 
  But look, why don't you just give me the core, and I will split the cash with you, hm? 
  No, that's a hard pass, Jimmy. 
  Really? 
  I mean, I'm not a mathematician, but what's half of $30 million? 
  30 million? 
  Ooh. 
  Let me think. 
  [WHISPERING] 
  He's trying to keep me on the phone. 
  Let's go. 
  [DOGS BARKING] 
  Well? 
  Don't leave me hanging, buddy. 
  Yeah, nice talking to you, Jimmy. 
  [BARKING CONTINUES] 
  [DOGS BARKING, GROWLING] 
  [SNIFFING] 
  JIMMY: You got 'em? 
  MAN: Bad news They got away. 
  [DEVICE BEEPING] 
  [CAR ALARM CHIRPS] 
  Right. 
  Let's get this plutonium back to MI6 and celebrate a job well done. 
  Damn it. 
  That's an odd reaction. 
  I know we won. 
  It just doesn't feel like it 'cause Jimmy's still He's out there somewhere. 
  - Can I see your phone? 
  - Yeah. 
  I mean, look, he's got He's got so many connections. 
  He can just disappear. 
  He just does not deserve to live a good life. 
  Who are you Who are you calling? 
  Hey, Jimmy. 
  - Bartender! 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - What? 
  You miss me? 
  I know that Will's too much of a choirboy to take you up on your offer, but I'll take $20 million. 
  Half of $30 million isn't 20, sweetheart. 
  It is now. 
  I'm heading to a train station. 
  I'll text you the coordinates, and you can bring the cash if you're interested. 
  Are you completely mad? 
  Why did you do that? 
  Because Will doesn't dislike anybody, but he hates Jimmy. 
  She's right. 
  Jimmy he's the worst. 
  Fair enough, but do you really think he's just gonna show up and hand you a bag of money? 
  No. 
  He's gonna show up and try to kill us. 
  Right. 
  Well, let's get going, then. 
  The team is safe and on the move. 
  Cool. 
  - You okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  I just really wanted it to work out for Standish. 
  Mm. 
  Sorry. 
  I'm bringing my own baggage into this. 
  Oh. 
  Well Ray's listening. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  [INHALES DEEPLY] 
  I don't know This job it makes relationships so hard. 
  And after my divorce, I just I guess I just wanted to know that it could work out, you know? 
  For people like us. 
  It can. 
  Sometimes it just takes a little more effort. 
  That is oddly mature coming from you. 
  Actually, my new buddy Ken told me that. 
  He's a pretty positive guy. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  What am I gonna do with you, Ray? 
  [TRAIN HORNS BLOWING] 
  WILL: All right, Jimmy's gotta be close. 
  - I'll scout ahead. 
  - Copy. 
  [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  We'll be here. 
  Uh, I find that, um, with relationships, it's best to just lay everything out on the table. 
  I prefer to bury it deep down where nobody will ever find it. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I mean, it's not like I have a choice, anyway. 
  Will tends to just say whatever he's feeling the instant he feels it. 
  Yeah. 
  He does. 
  It's exhausting. 
  And And whether that's about his family or his dreams about the future or if that is about you two drinking wine of an evening. 
  Ah. 
  He told you about that. 
  'Course he did. 
  He tell you about the massage, too? 
  He did. 
  Emma. 
  Nothing happened. 
  No, no, I know. 
  No, he told me that, too. 
  [KNOCK ON WINDOW] 
  All right, everything's set inside. 
  Let's roll. 
  [MAN SPEAKING SPANISH ON P. A. ] 
  All right, keep your eyes out. 
  Our friends are here. 
  All right. 
  Time to play a little three card monte. 
  [WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH ON P. A. ] 
  [CRACKLING] 
  Here we go. 
  JIMMY: Just gotta follow the plutonium. 
  [CRACKLING INTENSIFIES] 
  [GRUNTS] 
  Yep. 
  [CRACKLING INTENSIFIES] 
  [DOG BARKS] 
  [CRACKLING INTENSIFIES] 
  Good luck. 
  You too. 
  [CRACKLING INTENSIFIES] 
  [SIGHS] 
  Hola, amigo. 
  You know the drill Put your gun down, blah, blah, blah. 
  What's with the three-bag do-si-do? 
  I mean, it's so unnecessary. 
  Ah, I was just trying to keep it fun. 
  That's always been your problem, Will. 
  You could've killed me in the bunker and been done with it. 
  But no, your pesky little moral code has always slowed you down. 
  Hey, you know, my partner's always on me about that, too, so I gotta say again I like her. 
  Oh. 
  I'm gonna hang around and kill her for fun. 
  All right. 
  Give me the core so I can be on my way. 
  [CRACKLING] 
  [BEEP] 
  [ZIPPER OPENS] 
  Depleted uranium rounds. 
  They give off enough radiation to fool a Geiger counter. 
  I thought they'd make a nice retirement present for you. 
  - That's funny. 
  - Yeah. 
  Don't suppose you're gonna tell me where the real core is, huh? 
  You know, had I been a better shot, I might've finished this last time in the desert 16 years ago. 
  But I won't miss this time. 
  Neither will she. 
  [GRUNTS] 
  He said he wanted to kill you. 
  Did he? 
  Yeah. 
  Go for it. 
  You know, you two are gonna wake up someday and realize all your years of service are for nothing. 
  - Oh. 
  - Yeah. 
  And then you're gonna wish you kept a little piece for yourself. 
  Yeah. 
  You're probably right. 
  Hey, do you mind if I take a little piece for myself? 
  I'd be disappointed in you if you didn't. 
  She'd be disappointed if I didn't. 
  Good seeing you again, Jimmy. 
  'Til next time, Will Chase. 
  [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] 
  - You tweak your shoulder again? 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  I don't want anyone to know, though, so don't say anything, okay? 
  Don't look at it, either. 
  Everything good on your end, Emma? 
  Core's with me. 
  I'm on the 9:15 to Paris. 
  Well done, everyone. 
  [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
  Spanish authorities have the target in custody. 
  We'll fly back as soon as Standish is done. 
  Done with what? 
  Standish, where are you? 
  STANDISH: I'm offsite. 
  Got pulled into this surveillance gig. 
  Feels like any idiot could do this job. 
  Well, remember, you're not just any idiot. 
  Thank you? 
  Oh, and hey, tonight, do me a favor. 
  Just drop the act and be yourself. 
  What? 
  Susan, what are you talking about? 
  That doesn't make any sense. 
  Agent Marek Hey. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I was told somebody needed backup. 
  Susan. 
  Nice. 
  Look, I'm really sorry about last night. 
  Apologize to Brooklyn, or I'm leaving. 
  I'm sorry, Brooklyn. 
  I'm from Yonkers, by the way. 
  I can hang with Yonkers. 
  [COMPUTER WHIRS] 
  So what's all this stuff? 
  Ah, nothing. 
  Just some fiber-optic uplink I'm using to piggyback off a satellite in China. 
  Hmm. 
  Pulse encryption or quantum interference? 
  Okay. 
  Um little bit of both. 
  It's my own little special blend. 
  Check it out. 
  [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
  [COMPUTER BEEPING] 
  Did you just shut off the power grid? 
  Yes, ma'am. 
  Nice! 
  Where was this guy last night? 
  [SIGHS] 
  I don't know. 
  But he's here now. 
  You want to cause a traffic jam? 
  - Yeah. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
  Well? 
  How'd operation Meet/Cute go? 
  Really good. 
  Thank you for setting up that surveillance mission between Tina and Standish. 
  Well, you said you would beat me up if I didn't. 
  I'm still grateful. 
  Good. 
  For what it's worth, your nose looks great. 
  Thank you. 
  It's makeup. 
  Don't tell anyone. 
  What You're not drinking? 
  You mean with, uh, Captain America and Hermione Granger? 
  [BOTH LAUGH] 
  You know, she's actually quite great. 
  I like her. 
  She is. 
  They tell each other everything. 
  Ugh. 
  - [SCOFFS] 
  - That's super annoying. 
  What's weird is, it makes me respect him more. 
  That's even more annoying. 
  Good? 
  Smells weird. 
  No, it's good. 
  So weird. 
  Hey, guys. 
  Quick toast? 
  Yeah? 
  Ooh, do you want me to Just stay, Ray. 
  Ray can stay. 
  Oh, wine! 
  Que fancy! 
  Yeah, I figured it was appropriate, you know? 
  Uh, okay, here's to never going back to Spain in the winter. 
  - Ooh. 
  - [TRILLS] 
  - Cheers. 
  - Salud. 
  Sharing the night together Ugh! 
  It's terrible! 
  Oh, I'm switching to beer. 
  Yeah, let's get some real booze. 
  I actually don't mind it. 
  Well, not as good as the stuff we had in Spain. 
  Mm. 
  That's 'cause it's not stolen. 
  That's true. 
  [GLASSES CLINK] 
  - I'm not gonna do it. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - Let's not. 
  Sharing the night together
