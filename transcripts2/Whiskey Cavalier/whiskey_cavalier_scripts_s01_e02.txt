 Do you think she misses me?    
 What did we decide about your feelings?    
 I have my feelings.    
 My feelings don't have me.    
 I was leaving this girl's apartment, and I got a little turned around.    
 Was she worth me almost getting killed?    
 [CHUCKLES LIGHTLY]    
 Nope.    
 Hey, Ray.    
 Will?    
 Did we, uh, interrupt something?

 Will, if you need anything, please call me any time of day or night.    
 I think I'm gonna need another piece of this strudel.    
 - It is incredible. 
- Ah!    
 See, honey, this is why I wanted to Airbnb...    
 - Feel like a local.

 You sure you don't want another bite?    
 - I'm good. 
- All right.    
 Missing out.

- Ohh!

- Mm. Mmm!    
 You know, this is an old recipe from my grandmother.    
 When I was a child, I was a real  Naschkatze.

 Look, Stavros is gonna be here any minute, and I don't want to miss our target because you were too busy making eyes at Frau Strudel.    
 Okay, first of all, stop hitting me with rifle parts.    
 It's rude.    
 Second, it's called polite conversation.    
 - It's what non-robots do. 
- Hmm.    
 And, for future reference, any time anyone ever offers me an authentic Bavarian dessert...    
 Strudel, streusel, marzipan, Black Forest cake, carrot cake... That's Bavarian...

 Stavros Pappas.    
 Greek shipping magnate. At least, that's his day job.    
 In his off time, he moonlights as a smuggler for the world's criminal elite.    
 Word has just come out that he keeps a ledger of all his illegal transactions and his customers.    
 It's a Who's Who of the world's most wanted.    
 That ledger will help us dismantle criminal networks, take down terrorist cells...    
 The possibilities are endless.    
 The problem is, the ledger is kept in a vault that can only be accessed via Stavros's retinal scan, which means we got to grab Stavros...    
 Alive,  Frankie...    
 [SCOFFS LIGHTLY]    
 WILL: ...and get him to open the vault so we can get our hands on the ledger and put a lot of bad people behind bars.

 I hope your team is enjoying your new working arrangements.

 Actually...  some of us are, uh... Are really leaning into it.

 Now, I'm in surgery all day tomorrow, but...

 So you're an orthopedic surgeon?

 Prague, to be exact.     
 Great. We'll saddle up.

 to open the vault.   
 Stavros is one.     
 His widow, Karen, is the other.     
 She has no knowledge of her husband's criminal empire.   
 She's been separated from Stavros for some time.   
 We need you to get her retinal scan and secure that ledger before that other team does.     
 All right, based on our blond friend in Vienna, we'll have to move fast. Any update on who she might be?     
 Working on it. You'll be the first to know.     
 Okay. Thank you, sir.   
 Oh, one more thing.     
 I have no interest in being kept up to date   
 on the day-to-day illicit activities of your team.   
 That's the type of thing that could end a career.     
 So I'm assigning you someone to lay out your missions, act as a liaison, and basically serve as support wherever you are in the world.     
 Sounds like a horrible job.     
 It is.
