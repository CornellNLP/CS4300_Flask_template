 Will Chase... FBI!   
 [TIRES SQUEAL]   
 [GRUNTS]   
 Frankie Trowbridge... CIA.   
 CASEY: The world is in chaos, so we've assembled all of America's best intelligence assets under one banner.   
 We are all officially working together.   
 As a team.    
 - Led by me. 
- Led by me.    
 Previously on "Whiskey Cavalier"...   
 Frankie, you got to start trusting people.    
 You think now is a good time for me to start working on that?    
 I'm assigning you someone to lay out your missions, service support wherever you are in the world.    
 Knock, knock.    
 I'm so excited to be part of this team.    
 Ooh-kay. Too soon?    
 Four years at MIT, three years at the NSA, and I have been reduced to "Lock the door, Standish."    
 WILL: We gotta grab Stavros... alive.    
 [GRUNTS]    
 You're too emotionally available for a spy.    
 WILL: Get him to open the vault, and we can get our hands on the ledger and put a lot of bad people behind bars.    
 WILL: You were right. I opened up my big, dumb heart.    
 It  may  have impacted the mission.    
 May  have?!    
 [WILL AND FRANKIE COUGHING]    
 Can we agree this is  his  fault?    
 Hey!    
 Did you cut my brakes?    
 What you did to Will is unforgivable.    
 You'll never be a part of this team.    
 I could've died!    
 Chance I was willing to take, Ray.

 We have the Prime Minister and his wife.    
 If the names on the list are not released by noon, we will execute them both.    
 Okay, he just set a noon deadline.    
 Standish, where are you on finding their location?    
 I triangulated the signal from the call.    
 I'm outside the building now.    
 Sending the address.    
 That's on the other side of London.   
 It's almost noon.    
 There's not enough time for Will and Frankie to drive there.    
 WILL:  No problem!   
 We had a different idea!   
 FRANKIE: Why do  you  get to drive?    
 Because I got in first.    
 That's not a good system.    
 Well, at the dock, I said, "Ladies first."    
 You said, "I guess that means I'm after you"...    
 Very funny, by the way...    
 So now you don't get to drive.    
 Totally worth it.

 I'm an Eagle Scout.     
 Sweetie, I know you're super proud of that, but it's not as sexy as you think it is.     
 Oh. It's pretty sexy.     
 Director Casey wants to talk to the two of us.     
 Alright. You guys wait here.     
 We'll fill you in.     
 Can't wait.     
 Or we can listen in on everything they're saying.

 We just have to work on your timing and delivery and level of appropriateness.

 So, agents, let's talk about the future of your team.     
 Oh, Director Casey is saying Jai and I are like a... diverse Batman and Robin.     
 You're Robin.     
 Oh, now he's talking about you.     
 - Uh-oh. 
- Hmm?

 Fine.     
 There it is.     
 This better be good.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 Home, sweet home.     
 - So, we should probably... 
- [DOOR CLOSES]     
 ...debrief you on the Casey meeting.     
 Basically, he told us that...     
 Because of how our first mission went, he's not sure if he's keeping the team together.     
 Wait, how did you know that?     
 Jai bugged you.     
 You should probably get used to that.     
 Yeah. We heard everything.     
 Susan.     
 Well, I'd expect this from them, but you?     
 Well, I said no at first, but, uh, then I got excited, so...     
 STANDISH: Look, I don't get it.     
 Why would they disband the team?     
 Our first mission wasn't  that  bad, was it?     
 No. I mean, we killed our target, flooded a bank, and Will made kissy-face with the leader of an international crime organization.     
 I didn't make kissy-face.     
 I mean, you did a little bit.     
 So, what do we do now?     
 We treat it like a normal workday.     
 I mean, look, if this old bar is gonna be our permanent home, I say we clean it up a bit, huh?     
 Ooh. Sounds fun.     
 I'm not sure you know what fun is.     
 I know it's not cleaning.     
 You guys think that's fun, right?     
 Oh, yeah. This is my office. [LAUGHS]     
 Well, hope they don't break up the team, 'cause this definitely beats my cubicle at the NSA.     
 Thank you for that, by the way.     
 Hey, don't mention it.     
 Will, I want you to know, I'm-a do you proud, man.     
 Good. Good.     
 And I want you to know I'm gonna have you doing mostly tech work to start.     
 Oh.     
 It's cool, but eventually, you'll want me out there in the field.     
 Can't leave the big dog tied up on the porch, right?     
 "Big dog on the porch." Sure, yeah.     
 Um, Standish, you...     
 [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]     
 You've never had any weapons training.     
 - No. 
- Show me how you hold a gun.     
 You know what, I actually wanted to talk to you about that...     
 - Okay. 
- ...uh, because I think it would be great... if I had... two.     
 - Oh! 
- Give myself a signature.     
 - Sure.

 Always listening.     
 - Right. 
- Mm-hmm.     
 Here's the thing, Standish.     
 Uh, the business we're in is real.     
 The bullets are real.     
 It's not... It's not a video game.     
 You get shot...     
 you die.     
 - You got it? 
- Yeah.     
 Yeah, no, I mean, I got it.     
 No, you don't.     
 But you will.     
 Look, I think you have the potential to be a great agent, and I'm gonna help you get there.     
 I promise. You just...     
 You got to be patient.     
 And... And for future reference, when you go to shoot someone, you want to make sure that you actually see them.     
 Right.     
 Will, Standish, Ray's here.     
 Oh, okay. Great.     
 Now that we're all here, I have a mission for you guys.     
 If you pull it off, you're golden, and if you don't, well, they're going to disband the team, and I get fired.     
 Oh. Sounds like a lose-win situation.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 Maybe I'll just get right to the mission.     
 Ooh, wait for it.     
 [DEVICE BEEPS]     
 Ooh! Hey.     
 Will said treat today like a normal workday, so I upped our security system and shielded us against any electronic surveillance.     
 Wow. That's... That's great, Jai.     
 Kiss-ass.     
 Okay, well, your target is an Italian neofascist group, Fascia Rossa.     
 And due to the Italian immigration crisis, right-wing hate groups have been popping up all over the place.     
 But Fascia Rossa is different.     
 Because they're backed by a billionaire, they can cause havoc on a massive scale.     
 And Fascia Rossa has proven adept at using social media propaganda to grow in size.     
 And I'm guessing they convinced their followers     
 that immigrants are the cause of all problems plaguing Italy.     
 Exactly. And now their leader, Luca Crudele, wants to take Fascia Rossa to the next level.     
 We have Intel that an American engineer, Thomas Andrews, has been recruited to the group.     
 Andrews' specialty is chemical bombs.     
 They are paying him to make a weapon of mass destruction.     
 Your mission is to extract Andrews before he begins building a bomb and to get him to turn on Fascia Rossa.     
 And the most important part...     
 ...to save my job. [CHUCKLES]     
 Let's go.
