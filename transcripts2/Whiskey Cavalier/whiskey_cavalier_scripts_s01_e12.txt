 Previously on "Whiskey Cavalier" The three of us should grab a beer sometime. 
  Ray, I feel like we've been down this road before. 
  I'm gonna let Jai take this one. 
  You stole his girlfriend, broke his heart, and he pretty much wants you dead. 
  Okay. 
  I'm just hoping to hang around long enough that someday, Will will forgive me and let me back in. 
  I have five sisters. 
  In my house, it could get pretty vicious. 
  And my only defense mechanism was reading people. 
  But it didn't make my sisters want to hang out with me much. 
  Frankie Trowbridge her parents were killed in a terrorist attack. 
  So cataclysmic loss, probably blames herself, definite fear of intimacy. 
  Let me make something clear. 
  I don't mix the personal with the professional. 
  So I'm never going to let myself care about any of you. 
  I don't care that the weather is crappy. 
  You know what I love about Los Angeles? 
  Is it how people walk on the beach without annoying each other with small talk? 
  Ignoring your hint, moving on with my thought. 
  - Mm. 
  - L. A. has everything. 
  I mean, you want the ocean? 
  Boom. 
  There it is. 
  Mountains? 
  Whoa! 
  Right there! 
  You want a little joy in your life? 
  They've got Disneyland. 
  Yeah, I'm not big on joy. 
  I'm well aware of that. 
  We're here to stop a former Homeland Security agent from selling state secrets, not go on amusement park rides. 
  Oh, so that's a that's a "No" to the Ferris wheel? 
  Correct. 
  Alright, but when we're done, I'm gonna ask again 'cause it's right there! 
  Come on! 
  It's so close! 
  Alright. 
  There they are. 
  That's a camisole. 
  Alright, I'll stick with the buyer. 
  You get the seller. 
  No. 
  I'll get the buyer. 
  You're just saying that 'cause it's the opposite of what I said. 
  No comment. 
  Aw, we got to run? 
  We got to do this? 
  Aah! 
  Will! 
  Will, are you okay?! 
  Wait here. 
  You're okay?! 
  Why would that upset you? 
  Great! 
  Uh, where's your guy? 
  You happy? 
  I don't Wait, did he get away because you came to check on me? 
  I don't want to talk about it. 
  - You were worried about me! 
  - No, I wasn't. 
  You were. 
  This is a big moment for us. 
  Thank you for caring so much. 
  Not another word, okay? 
  Hey, we should go on the Ferris wheel now. 
  Look, you have to stop beating yourself up about L. A. 
  Yes, the buyer got away, but he didn't get what he wanted, so I know. 
  What's wrong with me? 
  Why do I even care if you get shot? 
  I have, like, a thousand answers to that. 
  Look, Frankie, all you did was show some compassion. 
  Now, I'm sure it probably feels weird to you, but trust me, it's a good thing. 
  You're so annoying. 
  Right? 
  That feels like a trick question. 
  She's just mad at me 'cause she showed some compassion. 
  Frankie? 
  Compassion? 
  Unh! 
  Yeah. 
  She got sharp knuckles. 
  Alright, I got to go get our new mission from Ray. 
  You want to step into Frankie's spot? 
  Yes! 
  Finally! 
  Does this make me co-leader? 
  Do I get a raise? 
  Can I wear my new sunglasses? 
  No. 
  Pretty dark in here. 
  Can you even see? 
  I can see fine. 
  Perfect. 
  Oh, Ray, before we get started, Frankie's kind of upset about losing her guy in Los Angeles. 
  Can you see if you can track down the buyer for me? 
  So, you want me to do you a favor, like a friend would? 
  I'm just grateful that you're letting me back in your life. 
  Ray, I'm not I My partner would like to get right to the mission. 
  You know, you're not allowed to come to these anymore. 
  Why? 
  Why do you think? 
  Don't look at me You can't even see me. 
  Go ahead, Ray. 
  Meet Eddie Benson. 
  Owner of several Fortune 500 companies. 
  We believe his most profitable venture is running a massive drug cartel. 
  It manufactures and distributes illegal opioids. 
  His pills are responsible for a spike in teenage overdoses all up and down the Eastern Seaboard. 
  What, and the DEA can't pin anything on Benson? 
  Nope. 
  But we have intel that several prominent businessmen acted as silent partners. 
  They gave money to the operation without getting their hands dirty. 
  Hmm. 
  Including Daniel Lou. 
  He's the CEO of one of Benson's companies. 
  A philanthropist, he's married to a federal judge in Connecticut. 
  Daniel is our way in. 
  Why him? 
  His wife, Kelly Ashland. 
  She's the closest thing that Frankie has to family. 
  No way. 
  Frankie always refers to "family" as the "F" word. 
  That's true. 
  So, we use Kelly to get close to Daniel. 
  If he flips on Benson, we can take him and his entire cartel down. 
  Alright, well, looks like Frankie and I are heading to Connecticut. 
  - Aah! 
  - Come on. 
  I'm sorry. 
  You got to take those things off, man. 
  Never. 
  Hey, Will? 
  38 minutes. 
  38 minutes. 
  See that? 
  That's how long you went without speaking. 
  I told myself I was just gonna wait you out. 
  My head almost exploded. 
  Ah. 
  If I open up a little bit, do you promise not to overreact? 
  Mmmmmmm nope. 
  Kelly was like a second mother to me. 
  She was good friends with my parents and when they died, she became my guardian. 
  I was 17. 
  I wasn't the easiest kid to deal with. 
  Anyway, I haven't spoken to her since I joined the CIA. 
  Family's a liability. 
  That feels healthy. 
  Yeah. 
  She gets it. 
  She taught me to be strong not to let my emotions knock me off my path. 
  She's the toughest person I know. 
  I love how closed-off she is. 
  That's not a thing people say. 
  Ooh! 
  What? 
  You guys haven't seen each other in a long time. 
  This is exciting. 
  Come on. 
  Aren't you excited? 
  Maybe you should wait in the car. 
  Open, open, open, open. 
  Surprise! 
  Huh? 
  Kelly. 
  It's good to see you. 
  Frankie. 
  It's been a long time. 
  Okay, so, not exactly a hug, but still a moment. 
  Right. 
  You guys want me to get a picture of this? 
  Here you go. 
  Got it. 
  Is he always like this? 
  Pretty much. 
  He's cute, but it makes him less cute. 
  Tell me about it. 
  I mean, he tried to talk to me in the car the whole way here! 
  So annoying. 
  Oh, God. 
  There's two of them. 
  I need to delete that. 
  So are you two a couple? 
  You tell me. 
  Hmm. 
  Well Oh. 
  You always liked green eyes. 
  Oh. 
  Watch out. 
  But he's a bit of a human Care Bear. 
  In a good way. 
  Eh, eh I'll take it. 
  Kelly, you got a beautiful family here. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Yeah. 
  That's my husband, Daniel, and our son, Tommy. 
  I can't wait for you to meet them. 
  Yeah. 
  So much has changed. 
  Oh, Frankie. 
  You made the wall. 
  And you're in a prom dress. 
  That's not me. 
  And it's pink. 
  Oh, it's so pink! 
  I will kill you dead. 
  I'm gonna take a picture of this and send it to everybody I know. 
  I'm gonna need some wine. 
  - I'm in. 
  - Great. 
  I'll join you guys in just a second. 
  Don't rush. 
  What would you like? 
  Um what do you have? 
  Look at that smile. 
  Oh, my goodness. 
  I can't believe you went as Britney Spears for Halloween. 
  Oh, that wasn't Halloween. 
  That was just a normal day of school. 
  No. 
  It was just a short year-long phase. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - I can't believe you made a scrapbook. 
  And a son! 
  What happened to you? 
  Oh. 
  I, um Really missed you after you left. 
  And I realized that I really liked having someone in my life, someone that I could care for. 
  And it was hard, but as soon as I opened up, I met Daniel, and we had Tommy. 
  And, well, I I'm happy. 
  That's nice. 
  I'm gonna get some more wine. 
  Well, I think it's great. 
  And not just because you kept this picture of Frankie in cornrows, which I'm gonna take. 
  Yeah? 
  Alright. 
  It's gonna come in handy. 
  Oh, you think that's silly? 
  Look at that one. 
  Ooh! 
  Yikes. 
  That's priceless. 
  There are just so many good ones. 
  And how about you, Frankie? 
  I think about you a lot. 
  Are you happy? 
  Yeah, sometimes. 
  You know, when you were a kid, I was so busy with cases, and I just I really worry that I was too strict. 
  You were fine. 
  So, what does the, um CIA have you into town for this time? 
  We're looking for a counterfeiter. 
  Yeah. 
  Uh, Treasury sent us down here to check things out. 
  Which reminds me we have a lot of work to do. 
  Oh. 
  Alright. 
  Thank you. 
  Before you go, come here. 
  Why? 
  Okay. 
  And how about you, big guy? 
  You want one? 
  You know it. 
  Coming in hot. 
  Come on. 
  We just met. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  But still, right? 
  I-I know, but no. 
  That's alright. 
  We got time. 
  Kelly seems to have changed a lot. 
  I mean, she's the woman who molded you into the fiercely independent woman you are, and yet, now she's so open and compassionate. 
  Don't you think? 
  What, are we not talking again? 
  Alright. 
  I'll start the clock back up. 
  I'm inputting the photos that Will sent and running facial recognition, seeing if any of Daniel's friends have criminal records that connect to Benson's. 
  Alright, we have surveillance from all the cameras that Frankie put inside Kelly's house. 
  Hey, party people! 
  Who wants doughnuts? 
  I do. 
  But whenever you bring me food, you want something. 
  That is not true. 
  But can I ask you a favor? 
  What do you want? 
  Well, see, I'm trying to track down that Los Angeles buyer for Will, but I'm having a little trouble. 
  So I was wondering if maybe you could help me out with Operation "Win Will's Friendship Back"? 
  Why don't you send him a box of doughnuts? 
  Mm. 
  Must be nice being Will's guy. 
  I used to be his guy. 
  He used to yell at me for doing stupid things, like wearing sunglasses inside. 
  You can't guilt me, Ray. 
  Okay, how about this? 
  If you say yes, I promise I will leave right now. 
  Oh, God. 
  Please say yes. 
  Fine. 
  I'll get to it when I have some time. 
  Thanks, buddy. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Okay, I went back and read the psych evaluation I did on Frankie. 
  All the pertinent info on Kelly Will's right. 
  She's totally clean. 
  Wait, you did a psych evaluation on Frankie? 
  I did. 
  So, do you write psych evaluations on us, as well? 
  What? 
  Can we see them? 
  What? 
  I feel like you can hear us. 
  Look, it is my job to write psych profiles on every member of the team. 
  But it's not healthy for you to read them. 
  Okay. 
  No problem. 
  Thank you. 
  I need you to come to the bathroom with me. 
  Right now. 
  This better be work-related. 
  Come stand in front of this sink. 
  - You good? 
  - Yeah. 
  Alright. 
  Huh? 
  Yo! 
  How did you build that? 
  I didn't. 
  I just found this button. 
  I guess it's leftover from when the CIA ran this place. 
  During the Cold War, they probably used it to, like, spy on assets and torture people. 
  Just fun CIA stuff. 
  But I did build this. 
  Okay, this place is awesome. 
  Dude, you have your own secret lair! 
  This is my Batcave. 
  I Yoh, no! 
  Don't touch that. 
  Those are exploding glasses. 
  And exploding keys exploding nail clippers. 
  Everything explodes. 
  Except for those two. 
  Jai, is that a computer station for me? 
  'Cause if so, I may get emotional. 
  In case someone wants to break into some files without Susan finding out. 
  Okay. 
  How long do you need to pull up our psych evals? 
  You already got it. 
  It's right there. 
  Enjoy. 
  Ooh! 
  That's so true about me. 
  Loyalty is my best quality. 
  That's tough, but fair. 
  I told her that in confidence. 
  Okay, now I'm hurt. 
  How bad is yours? 
  Hey. 
  What are you watching? 
  A horror film. 
  - Mwah! 
  - Love you. 
  Let's go. 
  Yeah, that's terrifying. 
  This is what happens when you go soft. 
  You end up married to a man who launders money for a drug lord so that you and your son can have a nice house. 
  Yeah, well, that's that's always what happens. 
  Now I have to tear them apart and ruin Kelly's life. 
  I'm gonna talk to Daniel. 
  Maybe I'll shoot him. 
  No, you can't just assume Daniel's gonna start talking about Benson and incriminate himself. 
  Alright, we need some sort of leverage. 
  Ask and you shall receive. 
  Oh. 
  Got a hit on that picture you sent back. 
  Rodney Seagel. 
  He works for Daniel's company. 
  He's a chemist with a nice but modest salary. 
  And yet, he has millions of dollars in offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands. 
  Alright, so, Seagel takes us to Daniel, Daniel rolls on Benson, we can take down the cartel. 
  - Sounds good. 
  - Yeah. 
  Point me in Seagel's direction. 
  Standish hacked into his calendar. 
  He's playing tennis at a sports club in Westport first thing tomorrow morning. 
  Oh, that's great. 
  I look great in tennis shorts. 
  You look terrible in those shorts. 
  Please. 
  I look amazing. 
  Alright. 
  Stay in character. 
  Come on your turn. 
  - Okay. 
  - Ohh! 
  Maybe golf is more your sport. 
  Sorry I didn't have time growing up to play rich white guy sports. 
  I was too busy being cool and having fun. 
  Alright, let's let's stop. 
  Let's work on your forehand here for a second. 
  Okay? 
  Just I want you to stand right about here. 
  Okay, show me how you hold the racket. 
  Alright, that's where we'll start. 
  Just turn it just a little bit like that. 
  Okay, great. 
  Now, forehand, you start low. 
  - Okay. 
  - Right? 
  Take it all the way over your shoulder. 
  - Show me that. 
  - Okay. 
  Yep. 
  Low to high. 
  Yeah, just like that. 
  Okay, easy with the rackets. 
  Remember, there's a tranquilizer switch in the handle, so don't stick him for too long. 
  Otherwise, his heart might, you know stop. 
  Yeah. 
  That's cool. 
  It is cool. 
  So proud. 
  Alright, so, when Seagel gets here, we'll just put him down and take him home. 
  Easy peasy. 
  Uh, guys. 
  Looks like Seagel brought friends. 
  And they're not dressed for tennis. 
  Hey. 
  I have this court reserved. 
  Sorry. 
  She's she's holding me hostage here. 
  Just give us a second. 
  Right, so, like I was telling you, remember the forehand. 
  You go low to high. 
  Oh! 
  Now I get it. 
  Keep working on that form! 
  Everyone get down! 
  Ohh! 
  Seagel's on the run! 
  He's headed for the rear exit. 
  Oh, I'm sorry. 
  I forgot to say "fore. 
  " Fore, bitch. 
  Ohh. 
  Your form needs some work. 
  That's not what the machine says. 
  Good morning, sleepy head. 
  You can try, but those cuffs, they're gonna be tough to break. 
  Where am I? 
  In a bar, about to be charged with attempted murder of federal officers. 
  How did I get here? 
  Oh, I stuck you with a tennis racket tranquilizer. 
  And yes that's a thing. 
  I-I'm not talking. 
  We'll see. 
  Ooh. 
  That's not good for you. 
  If I can get him talking, I'll grill him on the manufacturing and distribution of the opiates. 
  If we really want to bring down the cartel, we got to get rid of all the arms of the operation, or it'll just come back to life. 
  Right. 
  Frankie's on her way to Connecticut to pick up Daniel. 
  I need you guys to take a deeper dive into those corporate personnel records. 
  See if there's anybody else at Daniel's company we can tie into that cartel. 
  Wait, work with Standish? 
  Yeah, I-I'm not sure I can do that. 
  Given my obsessive need for order makes it impossible for me to connect with anyone at an emotional level. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Can you handle this on your own, Standish? 
  Oh, I'm sorry I don't know how to answer that, because I lack the ability to make quick decisions in a crisis due to my insecure nature. 
  What is happening? 
  You guys read your evaluations. 
  Ohh, yeah. 
  Yeah, and for your information, I don't seek the constant approval of my co-workers. 
  Right, Will? 
  You don't hear yourself right now, do you? 
  This is why I didn't want you guys to read them. 
  Is it because they're filled with lies? 
  Hey, analyzing behavior is Susan's job. 
  Come on. 
  Grow up. 
  Ooh! 
  Big words, coming from a man who is so emotionally invested in his job that he once risked his life to save a target's dog. 
  Yeah, look, Roscoe was a mistake. 
  Okay? 
  And not just because my building doesn't allow pets. 
  I'm grateful to Susan for pointing that out. 
  Look, you guys, I got to go meet Frankie, okay? 
  Can we drop this and get to work, please? 
  Fine. 
  Then I have to go to the bathroom. 
  Roscoe? 
  You put that in your report? 
  Come on. 
  That's not cool. 
  How is Roscoe doing? 
  Oh, look the family who adopted him keeps texting me pictures of him. 
  Look at this. 
  He's in a Christmas sweater here. 
  Check that out. 
  Alright, I don't trust people who don't like dogs. 
  I'm just saying. 
  Lucky for me, my persistence paid off. 
  I guess the fifth time was the charm. 
  She finally agreed to go on a date with me. 
  Because playing hard to get is cool. 
  I have to go get Tommy from soccer. 
  You better be here when I get back. 
  - Okay. 
  - Love you. 
  Love you, too. 
  Oh. 
  And make her help you do the dishes. 
  She always hated doing those. 
  So, you want to wash or dry? 
  You're lucky I don't shoot you. 
  I told everybody I was going to. 
  Excuse me? 
  You're a key player in Eddie Benson's opiate ring. 
  So you're gonna roll on Benson, and I'll put him away forever. 
  And then you'll only have to go to jail for, like, half of forever. 
  So that's nice. 
  I don't know what you're talking about. 
  Don't play dumb. 
  We have the chemist. 
  If you prefer, I could wait until Kelly comes home, and then the three of us can do this together as a family. 
  Please don't. 
  She doesn't know anything. 
  I swear, when Benson first asked me for the money, I didn't even know what I was investing in. 
  But when I found out, I-I didn't stop taking my share. 
  It was just so much money. 
  Look, I just want a great life for Tommy and Kelly. 
  Are you done? 
  Or did you want to roll through a few more excuses? 
  Look, I'll do whatever you want. 
  Just let me ask you a favor. 
  That's not how it works. 
  Just let Kelly hear it from me. 
  When she gets home, I'll tell her everything. 
  I'll say goodbye to Tommy. 
  And I'll meet you wherever you want, and I'll give you everything I have on Benson. 
  Please? 
  For Kelly? 
  Fine. 
  Go to this federal building and turn yourself in. 
  Don't try anything. 
  Or I'll hunt you down. 
  And I'm still not doing the dishes. 
  What's that? 
  Truth serum. 
  There's no such thing as truth serum. 
  I know. 
  After putting together all the info I could find on the chemist, his profile is fairly clear. 
  He's fiercely loyal, so he's reluctant to snitch. 
  But he's also a pragmatist, and he values self-preservation. 
  This is just saline. 
  Give him an excuse to talk and make him feel like it's not his fault. 
  Yeah, that's never gonna work. 
  Oh. 
  You're right. 
  I have no idea what I'm doing at all. 
  Thank you. 
  I think she was being sarcastic. 
  This is sodium thiopental, but you're probably more familiar with its colloquial name truth serum. 
  You're gonna feel tingling, mild shortness of breath, and then we're gonna have a nice, long conversation. 
  I told you, I'm not gonna talk. 
  You won't have a choice. 
  It's not your fault. 
  It's just science. 
  Looks like it's kicking in. 
  What's your full name? 
  Rodney Nigel Seagel. 
  Truthful. 
  Let's jump right in. 
  Would you say you only work for powerful men because you have father issues? 
  Or because you secretly get a sexual thrill out of being subservient? 
  It's because It's both. 
  Great. 
  Now we're gonna find out how a nice chemist like you got involved in the opiate business. 
  Holy crap. 
  It's working. 
  Susan is a scary woman. 
  Don't you feel that way about all women? 
  Yes, but particularly with Susan. 
  Daniel's gonna be here any second. 
  I called a couple guys from DEA to come bring him into custody once he's here. 
  That's great. 
  Hey, I need you to take a look at this intel for me. 
  Cornrows? 
  No way. 
  I know, right? 
  Spring break. 
  You look pretty. 
  Daniel, where are you? 
  I called Benson. 
  I told him it was an emergency and I need to see him. 
  I promise once he gets here, I'll bring him right to you. 
  W-W Daniel, wait a second. 
  That That's a terrible idea. 
  Benson is an extremely dangerous person. 
  I think it's better if you just come I have to do this for Kelly and Tommy. 
  I need to make this right. 
  No, Daniel, wait a second. 
  Da Gaaah! 
  Probably should've brought him in when you had him. 
  That's not a helpful thing to say. 
  No, Ray. 
  Look, it's gonna be fine. 
  Daniel is a smart guy. 
  This will all work out. 
  If goes and gets himself killed, Kelly will never forgive me. 
  Daniel. 
  Benson. 
  Thank you for coming so quickly. 
  Mm. 
  When the boss says jump, you jump. 
  What can I do for you, sir? 
  Just this. 
  Daniel. 
  What happened? 
  Nothing. 
  Benson never showed. 
  Don't worry about that. 
  We'll get him. 
  No more stunts like that, okay? 
  These men are gonna take you to the DEA office for questioning. 
  Thank you for being so kind. 
  I just I just want to make this right. 
  Look, we're just glad you're okay. 
  Alright? 
  Thank you, guys. 
  They'll take care of you. 
  Okay, so, the distribution is mostly run through company trucking lines, lowering the risk of the pills being intercepted by the police. 
  Hey. 
  Great news. 
  You can wrap this up, send this gentleman over to the DEA. 
  Daniel decided to roll on his own. 
  It's over. 
  Daniel's being driven to a federal prosecutor as we speak. 
  He's gonna testify against your boss Benson. 
  W Benson? 
  W What are you talking about? 
  Daniel runs everything. 
  He's the financial guy, yes, but No. 
  Benson is a nobody. 
  Daniel is the cartel. 
  We're on our way. 
  The officers moving Daniel were found dead in a parking garage. 
  Let's move. 
  Alright, hey, while we're on the road to Connecticut, see if you guys can pinpoint Daniel's location cellphone towers, credit card transactions anything you can think of. 
  - On it. 
  - Thank you. 
 
 
 
  I'm gonna finish questioning Seagel. 
  Can someone contact Justice about transferring him to a secure location? 
  Oh, you guys aren't speaking to me? 
  What? 
  No! 
  That would be crazy. 
  But since you want to take all the personal things that we say and use it against us, we're gonna be a little bit more careful. 
  Yeah, we're just gonna limit our interactions to a couple of pre-approved topics. 
  The weather, lunch, and the time of day? 
  It is 5:30. 
  Oh, that's one of my favorite times. 
  I'm a 6:00 a. m. guy. 
  - Really? 
  - I like garbage trucks. 
  I'm updating your profiles. 
  And under "Dominant characteristics," I'm going to put "childish" and "stupid"! 
  I'm assuming I'm childish. 
  Ha ha! 
  Whoo! 
  Outstanding! 
  What are you so happy about, Ray? 
  W Well, that was the first time Susan has used the words "childish" and "stupid" and not been referring to the Ray-dog! 
  Whoo! 
  High five! 
  Too slow. 
  Gotcha. 
  Listen, I'm guessing that this probably isn't a great time to, uh, ask you if you tracked down that buyer from L. A. yet? 
  Knew it wasn't a great time. 
  Alright, I'll see you stupid children later. 
  Okay, that can't stick and become a thing. 
  It's catchy. 
  Hey, guys. 
  We already checked the house. 
  Kelly, where's Daniel? 
  He said he needed to zip by one of his offices. 
  - What's going on? 
  - I'll go get the car. 
  - I'll come with you. 
  - No. 
  Tell her. 
  Look, I don't have a lot of time. 
  You and Tommy are in danger. 
  The real reason that I'm in town is because Daniel's not who you think he is. 
  He runs a very violent drug cartel. 
  Well, that's got to be a mistake. 
  My husband's not a criminal. 
  He is. 
  He's also a murderer. 
  Oh, this is ridiculous. 
  I don't believe you. 
  I got to go. 
  Look, it's me. 
  Trust me. 
  Trust you? 
  I haven't heard from you in years. 
  You've never responded to any of my letters. 
  You've obviously been lying to me since the second you got here. 
  - Kelly - No, you can't just waltz in and ruin my life. 
  I won't let you do it. 
  You're not part of this family. 
  Suit yourself. 
  I tried to warn you. 
  Copy that. 
  Will and Frankie are three minutes out from Daniel's Stamford office. 
  Well, Daniel's definitely there. 
  I hacked the company's network, and he's deleting all the files off the main server. 
  He's trying to cover his tracks. 
  I just knocked out security cameras to the building. 
  He'll never see Will and Frankie coming. 
  Nice work. 
  Oh! 
  Yeah, one more thing. 
  Tracked down the location of the L. A. 
  buyer that got away. 
  It took me four seconds. 
  You should really learn the littlest bit about technology. 
  Thank you. 
  Will's gonna be so stoked! 
  I mean, this is game-changer, baby. 
  Ray, what exactly do you think is gonna happen when you hand that to Will? 
  I'm just kidding. 
  You know, I might be a little bit ahead of myself. 
  But I give this to Will, he's gonna be grateful. 
  I'm immediately gonna say, "Hey, you want to grab some dinner?" - He can't say no - Ray. 
  Can I offer you a little bit of advice? 
  Many have tried. 
  Just play it cool, man. 
  For once. 
  So I shouldn't wrap this up like a present? 
  They're transporting Seagel over to the DEA. 
  I'll probably drive over there to help with the debrief. 
  Unless, of course, you guys need me here for something? 
  We're good. 
  Have a great day. 
  Okay. 
  Thanks. 
  Wow. 
  That was harsh. 
  What are you talking about, Ray? 
  Well, she's obviously trying to make up with you guys. 
  You know, it's funny. 
  Here I am, working so hard to get my friend back, and you guys are working so hard to lose yours. 
  I can't believe Ray has a point. 
  This is a new low. 
  Will and Frankie are on-site. 
  Look, you just have to look at it from Kelly's point of view, right? 
  She finally puts together this family, which Oh, my God! 
  You blabbed about this the whole way here. 
  No more about Kelly. 
  I know it didn't go the way you wanted it to with Kelly, right? 
  But you showed her a lot of compassion by trying to warn her. 
  You should feel good about that. 
  I don't. 
  I feel horrible. 
  Can we please concentrate on putting this b*st*rd away? 
  Yeah, alright. 
  Why are you smiling? 
  Me? 
  I'm not smiling. 
  I'm It's my resting face. 
  I have resting smile face, I guess. 
  We've got company. 
  Alright, I'm gonna let you call the play this time, and I'm gonna do the opposite of that. 
  Grow up. 
  Hey. 
  You want to build a snowman? 
  What's with the snowman crap? 
  Oh, I was listening to the "Frozen" soundtrack this morning during my workout. 
  Come on. 
  Musicals give me an endorphin rush. 
  It's great for cardio. 
  You should try it. 
  You are so sexy. 
  Come on. 
  - Cover me. 
  - Yep. 
  Going somewhere? 
  I don't suppose you would just take some of this and walk away? 
  Your future ex-wife raised me better than that. 
  Fair enough. 
  She's all yours, Wayne. 
  Good night. 
  You okay? 
  Did you get Daniel? 
  No. 
  I heard you getting your ass kicked, and I came in here to help. 
  Hey! 
  Just like you did with me in L. A. 
  Weird how I'm not all bent out of shape about it, huh? 
  You should've gotten Daniel. 
  I can take care of myself. 
  Yeah, no, I took out my three guys while you were losing to one in here. 
  Daniel sure had a lot of backup. 
  It's almost like they knew we were coming. 
  Kelly. 
  She tipped him off. 
  I tried to help you, and you betrayed me. 
  Kelly, I know that you tipped Daniel off. 
  That's obstruction of justice. 
  You know that! 
  You could lose your job, your son everything. 
  This was all a misunderstanding. 
  Daniel explained it all to me. 
  He just got in over his head financially with some bad people. 
  He tried to murder me. 
  Us. 
  Technically, he tried to murder us. 
  Frankie, I would never put you in danger. 
  You did. 
  I'm just saying, I was there, too. 
  No, he's the father of my child. 
  I shouldn't have warned him, but haven't you ever broken the rules for someone you care about? 
  Yes. 
  And I'll never do it again. 
  The good news is that now Daniel trusts you completely, so you're gonna call him and tell him that you want to run away together and totally set him up for us. 
  I'll do anything that you need. 
  I'm so sorry, Frankie. 
  Frankie! 
  She'll get over this. 
  You know how Frankie is. 
  Yeah. 
  I do. 
  Hey, you! 
  Let's go. 
  I got a private plane waiting. 
  Where's Tommy? 
  Kelly, what did you do? 
  Let me see your hands! 
  It's over, you son of a bitch. 
  Kelly. 
  I knew I couldn't trust you. 
  Now! 
  Man. 
  Does he buy these guys in bulk? 
  He's making a run for it. 
  Alright, you go after him. 
  I got Kelly. 
  Go. 
  Aaaaaaah! 
  You okay? 
  I think I want a divorce. 
  That's a big decision. 
  You might want to think about it. 
  Pretty sure. 
  Ugh! 
  Fair enough. 
  They got us outnumbered. 
  I want you to go around, get in the front seat, stay down, and put the car in reverse. 
  Okay? 
  I'll cover you. 
  Okay. 
  I think you're very brave. 
  Thank you. 
  And maybe a little stupid. 
  Okay. 
  I can see why Frankie's so into you. 
  Sh No. 
  We're partners. 
  Uh-huh. 
  Okay. 
  - Alright, ready? 
  - Yeah. 
  Go. 
  Wow. 
  That was impressive even for me. 
  Hey, Kelly, when we see Frankie, you got to tell her that Kelly? 
  Drop your gun and you kick it over to me. 
  Now. 
  Now! 
  I-I'm sorry it had to end this way. 
  Daniel! 
  Kelly, don't! 
  Kelly, what the hell are you doing? 
  I almost let you hurt her once. 
  I won't let it happen again. 
  Don't come near me. 
  How can you do this to us? 
  To Tommy? 
  K I-I don't want to shoot you, but I will. 
  No. 
  Think of our son. 
  The man I fell in love with is still in there somewhere. 
  I'm sorry. 
  That's for not realizing what you had. 
  Hands behind your back. 
  Thanks for the ride home. 
  Yeah, you bet. 
  Hey, you guys hungry? 
  You want a minute. 
  Alright. 
  I know that you were trying to protect me, but you didn't need to stand in front of that gun. 
  Look, I've been wanting to tell you something. 
  My life got so much better once I stopped being so closed off. 
  After all this? 
  Yeah still. 
  And I know you. 
  Once you start caring for someone, you run off in the other direction. 
  Yeah. 
  You lose enough people that you love, it seems safer. 
  I get it. 
  I get it. 
  Promise me you won't let what happened to me stop you from letting love back in your life. 
  I'll try. 
  And maybe we can have dinner soon? 
  Yeah. 
  I'll call you. 
  Will you? 
  Maybe. 
  Probably. 
  Yes. 
  Love you. 
  Love you. 
  Aww. 
  Wow. 
  Hey, I found an apple. 
  You want a hug? 
  Yeah, you know it! 
  Come on. 
  - Seriously? 
  - What? 
  He never learns. 
  Hey, I just saved your life. 
  I've saved yours a bunch of times. 
  No, you didn't. 
  I don't remember it. 
  Oh, did you say, "No, I didn't"? 
  Yeah. 
  Are you kidding me? 
  Oh, let me count the ways. 
  I didn't need you to be there. 
  Why did you guys text me to meet you here? 
  Just watch and be amazed. 
  Not something you say to a woman in a bathroom. 
  Whoa. 
  You have a secret lair? 
  Yeah, we built it. 
  Jai built it. 
  Oh! 
  Whoa! 
  So, showing you this is a metaphor. 
  We're friends. 
  We don't have to hide anything from each other. 
  Ohhh. 
  Thanks, guys. 
  You know, I think we should have a drink to celebrate. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yes! 
  Great idea. 
  - Wait, how do you know about - Oh, please. 
  I know you better than you know yourselves. 
  I've known about this place for months. 
  She's a witch. 
  To a mission well done. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Mm. 
  About that. 
  Are we gonna mention in the report that Kelly tipped off Daniel? 
  Um I was thinking of leaving that out. 
  You know, so she can keep her son and her job and everything. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Everybody makes mistakes, right? 
  Good to show compassion once in a while. 
  Yes, it is. 
  Are you okay? 
  I'm just so so moved right now. 
  I can't Hey, where are Jai and Standish and Susan? 
  Oh, I saw them go to the bathroom together. 
  W Oh. 
  Hey, here's that info you wanted on that buyer who shook you in L. A. 
  Oh, right. 
  Thank you, Ray. 
  No problemo. 
  What, no speech or lame attempt to win me over here? 
  Mm, no. 
  Hmm? 
  Alright. 
  Thank you, Ray. 
  Shall we? 
  - Yes. 
  - Yeah? 
  Is it ever sunny in L. A. ? 
  Man, you are fast when you want revenge. 
  This was fun. 
  Hey, can we go on the Ferris wheel now? 
  We'd have to take this guy with us. 
  I'm okay with that.
