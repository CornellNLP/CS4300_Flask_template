 Previously on "Whiskey Cavalier" When I blew it with Will, I didn't just lose my best friend. 
  I kinda lost my only friend. 
  JAI: I'm good at my job because I'm obsessive. 
  But I know it doesn't always make me the easiest person to be around. 
  We obviously have a connection. 
  And what we do is too important to risk messing up. 
  I'm sorry I can't be the girl you get ice cream with. 
  I can get ice cream with anybody. 
  You and me, we save the world. 
  Emma Davies, MI6. 
  You must be Agent Trowbridge. 
  And Agent Chase? 
  Interesting. 
  Do you fancy ice cream? 
  My love, roulette, roulette I still cannot believe you're here. 
  I wasn't gonna miss your birthday weekend. 
  That's very sweet of you. 
  Oh, you know what we should do this weekend? 
  What? 
  This. 
  Head over heels I go - Wow. 
  - Head over heels I go, I go, I go - I'm sorry. 
  That was cheesy. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  That was. 
  If you want to hop on a plane to London right now, I would understand. 
  - Head over heels we go - No, you're adorable. 
  And if that was a line, then it was very well done. 
  No, that wa [CHUCKLES] 
  - That was not a line. 
  I am not that smooth. 
  - No? 
  Mnh-mnh. 
  Not at all. 
  Slow, darling So, the line worked. 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  No, darling, I'll never let you go - [WHISTLING RINGTONE PLAYS] 
  - Ohh. 
  - Work? 
  - Always. 
  Hey, guys. 
  - Hey. 
  - Oh. 
  And once again, we all beat Ray here. 
  Cool. 
  Can I get you a beer? 
  - Yes, please. 
  - Good to see you, Emma. 
  You, too. 
  I didn't know we could bring dates here now. 
  Oh, c'mon, she's MI6. 
  Besides, I've brought a date here before. 
  Just not when anybody else was around. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Oh, great. 
  - [DOOR CLOSES] 
  - You guys are early. 
  Ooh, Brit in the house. 
  What's up, Emma? 
  [BRITISH ACCENT] 
  Cheerio, pip pip! 
  Oh, wow, you must have lived in London. 
  [NORMAL VOICE] 
  Actually, no. 
  Ray, you probably want to get to why you called us all here. 
  [BRITISH ACCENT] 
  Oh, right-o. 
  [NORMAL VOICE] 
  Look, guys, I should probably apologize. 
  I know I sent out the usual group text, but for this mission, I only need two of you. 
  - [SCOFFS] 
  - Unbelievable. 
  - Aw. 
  - Ray All right, which two, Ray? 
  - You saw Emma out there, right? 
  - I did. 
  And I gotta tell you, buddy. 
  She's a keeper. 
  The three of us should grab a beer sometime. 
  Ray, I feel like we've been down this road before. 
  I'm gonna let Jai take this one. 
  Okay. 
  You stole his girlfriend, broke his heart, and he pretty much wants you dead. 
  [WHISPERS] 
  I'm on the fence. 
  Okay, uh, let's get our brief on. 
  This is just a quick in-and-out Bulgarian authorities are having a hard time proving that a major pharmaceutical company is also moving black market opiates around the country. 
  We need you to intercept a truck so we can tie the narcotics back to the supplier. 
  Just get that truck and get out of there. 
  No. 
  STANDISH: So, you into humpback whales? 
  - Am I into humpback - Humpback whales? 
  Uh, do you know, I-I've never thought about it, really. 
  You haven't? 
  I've thought about it quite a bit. 
  I'm actually I think she's a good match for Will. 
  Look at you being the bigger person. 
  I know. 
  It's so rare for me. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I mean, it's not like Will and I were ever together. 
  That's true. 
  Still You know I ran into my ex-husband last week. 
  He's actually a good guy, but he was with his new fiancÃ©e, and I swear it took every ounce of self-control I had not to shoot both of them. 
  - You should've. 
  - I know. 
  I would've cleaned up the bodies for you. 
  - Thanks. 
  - [BOTH LAUGH] 
  I'm just saying it's okay to be human, Franks. 
  - I'll try it. 
  - Will you? 
  Not today, but, you know, I'll let you know. 
  All right, keep me Keep me in the loop. 
  - In the meantime - Oh! 
  Doing shots. 
  - Correct. 
  - Lord. 
  - [GLASSES CLINK] 
  - To humans. 
  Salud. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  I'll be back in less than 24 hours. 
  I promise. 
  Please, you know how many dates I've had to leave? 
  Have I made it clear that I really like you? 
  - Well, just remind me. 
  - Okay. 
  [TRUCK BEEPING] 
  Ray, tell us when they're done loading the truck, and we'll move in. 
  [MACHINERY WHIRRING] 
  Okay, Will, last box is on. 
  Let's do this. 
  Let's go. 
  [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] 
  [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] 
  OlÃ©, olÃ©, olÃ©, olÃ© [SCREAMS] 
  Hey! 
  [SHOUTING IN BULGARIAN] 
  Let's go! 
  [GUNSHOTS] 
  RAY: Good job, fellas. 
  The Brazilian soccer hooligans. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  That was awesome. 
  [MACHINERY WHIRRING] 
  [GROANS] 
  Did you see that woman? 
  I think she might have super powers. 
  It's time to go home. 
  We're done. 
  Yeah. 
  [BABY COOING] 
  [BABY CRYING] 
  Maybe we're not done. 
  [BABY CRYING] 
  I need to know now Know now Can you love me again? 
  I need to know now Know now Can you love me again? 
  Can you love me again? 
  So, what's the story on little Will Junior, here? 
  Seriously? 
  Is that baby really named Will? 
  Don't ruin the fantasy, Ray. 
  We just We haven't been able to locate his parents yet. 
  Okay, what's some random Bulgarian drug runner doing with a baby, anyway? 
  Hold up Uncle Ray's done some homework. 
  Turns out there's been a rash of missing children in that region of Bulgaria. 
  So this low-life isn't just trafficking drugs. 
  It's children, too. 
  Babies being taken, sold into adoption, kids put on the black market. 
  There's huge money in it. 
  So let's go back there, take this guy down. 
  Maybe we can locate Baby Will's family, then. 
  The problem is no one seems to care about some local Bulgarian thug. 
  Europol just needed to connect that drug shipment to the international supplier. 
  No one's even going after this guy? 
  C'mon, Ray, send us in. 
  I can't, man. 
  I mean, there's no official mission "But" sounds like there's a "but" coming - Ray. 
  - Come on, Ray. 
  - Do the right thing, Ray. 
  - Be a man, Ray. 
  Spit it out, Ray. 
  - but - There it is. 
  if you want to go off-book and take this guy down yourself, I'll try and keep it quiet. 
  Still, an unsanctioned operation on foreign soil, if If something goes wrong, you'll all go down. 
  Look, you guys, I'm going in, okay? 
  You You got to make up your own minds on this, but, uh But I'm doing this. 
  How cute is that baby? 
  Pretty damn cute. 
  [TOY SQUEAKS] 
  - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] 
  - Yeah? 
  There you go. 
  I sent you a pic. 
  - Aww! 
  - Ay, mi He's got Will's eyes. 
  - We're going to the airport. 
  - Yeah. 
  Wait, if this was an ugly baby, would we still be doing this? 
  - What's wrong with you? 
  - What's wrong with you? 
  - I can't. 
  - Thanks. 
  Ray, look, I know this can get you in trouble, but if you could lend us some ground support, - I'd appreciate it. 
  - I will see what I can do to get you some transportation and a safe house. 
  Thanks, b Uh-oh. 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE] 
  Well, I'm What the hell is that? 
  WILL: It's our transportation and our safe house. 
  Eventually I'm gonna have to murder Ray. 
  I'm not gonna stop you. 
  Oh, come on, y'all. 
  It's Spring Break Bulgaria. 
  I'm with Standish. 
  When I was a kid, my parents used to pile us into one of these and drive us down the shore. 
  How'd that turn out? 
  Oh, we all wanted to kill each other. 
  - Exactly. 
  - [VEHICLE DOOR OPENS] 
  - Oh, this is cozy. 
  - Sorry. 
  Oh, wait, no, I was just gonna You know what? 
  I'm just gonna go that way. 
  - Yeah, sure. 
  - Just wait, all right. 
  - Yeah. 
  - I'm just gonna sit. 
  - I'm just gonna - STANDISH: Yo! 
  The toilet's in the shower! 
  What a time saver! 
  Well, I guess I won't be taking a shower. 
  Guys, let's let's keep it down, all right? 
  The baby's secure and napping. 
  Mm, yeah, I feel like we should've put the baby down - after we hashed out the plan. 
  - It's pretty simple. 
  We're here to take down a child trafficker, and we've literally got nothing to go on. 
  How can there be no regionalized records of missing kids here? 
  The police station in Melnik is central to all the cases that Ray was able to dig up. 
  They'll definitely have more Intel in their files. 
  - Okay, let's start there. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Who's driving? 
  - Me. 
  I will be driving. 
  This is not up for discussion. 
  I need some space from that. 
  - No co-pilots. 
  - Unh-unh. 
  I don't trust you with that radio. 
  You listen to K-pop. 
  Stay there. 
  Yeah, but I don't want to listen to classical music - for the next five - Guys, the baby's sleeping. 
  Shh, shh, shh, shh - [BABY CRIES] 
  - [GROANS] 
  Okay, well, who's gonna have the first shift with the baby? 
  - I'll do it. 
  - I'll do it. 
  - Oh, you can do it. 
  - No, go ahead. 
  - No, I it's - No, look, we We can do it together, unless that's weird. 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  It's not weird. 
  [BABY CRYING] 
  [ENGINE STARTS] 
  So weird. 
  [RADIO BEEPS] 
  [BULGARIAN VERSION OF "HOLIDAY ROAD" PLAYS] 
  [SINGING IN BULGARIAN] 
  You know what? 
  Here. 
  I'm just gonna squeeze in here. 
  - Look at this. 
  Look. 
  - Are you ready for a picture? 
  [GASPS] 
  [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] 
  What was that for? 
  I'm gonna send it to my parents, tell them I got married and had a kid, totally freak them out. 
  Oh You really want to be a dad, don't you? 
  Oh, definitely. 
  Yeah, I love my parents. 
  They need grandkids. 
  That's just a fact. 
  Plus, I think it'd be a ton of fun, so And the world needs more of this. 
  - I mean, there can't just be one. 
  - Right, it's not fair. 
  - It's not fair. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  [SIGHS] 
  You'd be a great dad. 
  Thank you. 
  And I think you'd make an interesting mom. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I always thought that I'd have a little girl. 
  You know, I dreamed about all the silly stuff The bows, the ribbons, the The things that you teach her. 
  I-I was a total girly-girl. 
  I know, hard to believe. 
  It's impossible to believe. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Mm. 
  Anyway, with this job, I don't think it's likely either of us will ever have kids. 
  Come on, never say never. 
  Okay, look, I need you to be friendly when we're in there, all right? 
  - I-I know how to be friendly. 
  - Mnh. 
  And if they let us get a look at their case reports, see if we can find the names of families with missing children. 
  That way, we'll have somewhere to start. 
  - And, you know, friendly! 
  - [SCOFFS] 
  The Chief Directorate's office is right down here. 
  Thank you! 
  You're lovely. 
  [HUSHED] 
  Too much. 
  Sir, these two requested a moment of your time. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  [GUNSHOTS] 
  How can I help you today? 
  Hi! 
  We were actually hoping that we could talk - to you about some - My wife and I just wanted to come in and thank you personally. 
  Yeah, we were speeding like idiots, and, uh, Chief here didn't give us a ticket. 
  So I'm just reminding the Chief that he and I have met previously. 
  Oh. 
  Oh. 
  I remember you, too. 
  Big soccer fan. 
  Yes, huge. 
  So, we should be going. 
  Thank you. 
  Maybe later, I will pay you a visit. 
  Oh, I'd I'd be careful with that. 
  Yeah, the missus here, she doesn't like surprise guests. 
  Yeah. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I get mad. 
  Like, violently. 
  Well, either way I'll make sure I find you both. 
  So, until then, I suppose. 
  [HANDCUFFS CLICK] 
  [SNAPPING FINGERS] 
  [SHOUTING IN BULGARIAN] 
  [HANDCUFFS CLICK] 
  [SHOUTING IN BULGARIAN] 
  I can't believe you made me be friendly. 
  [MEN SHOUT IN BULGARIAN] 
  Stop! 
  [GRUNTS] 
  [SHOUTING IN BULGARIAN] 
  [COUGHING] 
  [MEN GROANING] 
  [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] 
  [PANTING] 
  So that's a "no" on help from the local authorities. 
  Some of the police are in on it. 
  FRANKIE: Let's get the hell out of here. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  Hey, Emma. 
  What's up? 
  Ooh, day drinking. 
  I like your style. 
  Well, it's already the afternoon in London, so, technically, I'm two pints behind. 
  Makes sense. 
  You want a drink? 
  Ah, sorry. 
  I'm not a big drinker. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  I'm totally kidding. 
  Yes, a beer, please. 
  So, how long have you and Will known each other? 
  Uh, we met at Quantico. 
  We became great buddies right away. 
  Will used to let me cheat off his tests. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Well, not exactly "let" me. 
  - He doesn't know. 
  Don't tell him that. 
  - [CHUCKLING] 
  I won't. 
  As long as you don't tell him what I got him for his birthday. 
  Ooh, what is it?! 
  No! 
  No, no, no, no. 
  Let me guess. 
  Um, ooh, it's heavy, but it's not too heavy. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Is it a doorknob? 
  No. 
  Why would I buy him a door Uh, no, it's a watch. 
  Ah! 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  Wow. 
  Um, how long have you two been dating? 
  Six days. 
  Six days. 
  Don't um, do you think you might be coming in a little bit hot? 
  Not that I'm soliciting your opinion, but I have a very dangerous job. 
  I have no interest in mucking around. 
  If I feel something, I express it. 
  Cool, totally. 
  Cool. 
  It's, um It's just that if, say, - I were to receive a gift like that - Mm-hmm. 
  I would run away like my hair was on fire, then I would melt my fingerprints off so I could never, ever be found. 
  Well, yes, I mean, of course you would, 'cause you're terrified of being vulnerable with anyone who cares about you. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Exactly. 
  - Wait. 
  What? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  [BULGARIAN MUSIC PLAYS] 
  JAI: I can't believe a cop is taking children. 
  Makes me sick. 
  - He thinks nobody can touch him. 
  - We can. 
  I tried reaching out to the few families of missing kids that Ray found, but they're too scared to talk. 
  Well, that's why we're here. 
  Let's find out where "here" is. 
  - Yeah. 
  - [BABY COOS] 
  Jai, I'm gonna need you to take a shift with the baby so that Standish can start gathering background - on our police chief. 
  - It's all good, Will. 
  I'm a multitasking rock star, right? 
  Yeah, plus, I'm not taking any shifts with any babies. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Babies are disgusting flesh sacks of viruses and bacteria, and if you touch them, you are literally touching poop. 
  Okay. 
  Obviously some issues under the hood there. 
  All right, got him. 
  Vladimir Koslov, better known to his friends as "Vlad," although I doubt he has any. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I'm looking up better-known associates now. 
  [COMPUTER BEEPS] 
  Uh, hello. 
  Martyna Losinski. 
  Polish, former special ops. 
  Dishonorable discharge. 
  Now a very attractive mercenary. 
  Yeah, we met her. 
  Hey, Jai, I'm sure Vlad's looking for us. 
  Can you at least take the RV off the grid? 
  That I can do. 
  Give me 90 seconds. 
  We'll be invisible to any form of electronic surveillance. 
  Thank you so much, baby hater. 
  Jai doesn't like you. 
  I don't know why. 
  'Cause you're so sweet. 
  He's an awful person, though. 
  He doesn't like me, either. 
  He's not a good judge of character. 
  I don't hate babies. 
  I just fear them. 
  [BABY COOS] 
  Wow. 
  So peaceful. 
  - I love spots like this. 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Someone could scream really loudly, and you'd never hear them. 
  That's unsettling. 
  Hey, Standish is gonna dig a little deeper into Vlad's background, maybe hack into his e-mails, find out where he's operating from. 
  You had them take DNA samples of Baby Will - back at the Hive? 
  - Yeah. 
  I love that you call him that, by the way. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'm sure his parents would talk, if we could find them. 
  I can help with that. 
  I'll try my contact at State. 
  Great. 
  Yeah, I'll reach, uh I'll reach out to New York. 
  [LINE RINGING] 
  No, you beat me to it! 
  I'm supposed to ring you on your birthday. 
  Did I catch you at a bad time? 
  No, no, I'm just hanging out with Ray. 
  Hey, happy birthday, buddy! 
  You [CLEARS THROAT] 
  You're with Ray? 
  Well, what are What are you guys doing? 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Just getting to know each other over a few beers. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  More than a few. 
  - This girl can put 'em back! 
  - I'm English! 
  - It's what we're good at. 
  - Oh, you're very English. 
  Yeah. 
  Oh, it's fun. 
  The fun one is her. 
  I'm telling you. 
  Hey, she's a keeper, man. 
  - Don't screw this up. 
  - He's a piece of work. 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  Yeah, he's a piece of something. 
  - Well, I miss you, and - We both miss you! 
  Just come back Come back soon. 
  Yeah, no, I-I intend to. 
  Uh, I-I should probably, um Okay, yeah, bye. 
  Oh, wait He's gone. 
  He's gone. 
  Ray and Emma miss me. 
  They're together, and, uh And they miss me. 
  Don't let Ray spin you out. 
  - It's not a big deal. 
  - Thanks, Frankie. 
  Yeah, out of everyone, you should be the one to give me relationship advice. 
  I appreciate that. 
  Ooh. 
  Well, now it's a family vacation. 
  Come on, let's tap out Standish. 
  [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  [VEHICLE DOOR OPENS] 
  [DOOR CREAKS, SLAMS SHUT] 
  [SIGHS] 
  - [BABY COOS] 
  - SUSAN: Oh. 
  - You changed that diaper in four seconds. 
  - Mm. 
  That was rodeo fast. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I've had lots of practice. 
  I worked my way through college as a nanny, so every diaper change got me a beer at the local dive bar. 
  - That's a weird system. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  So, how's that "being the bigger person" thing going? 
  Seeing how he just acted, would you give me permission to torture him, just a little, about Ray and Emma? 
  What do you say, baby? 
  Yes, we say go have fun with that. 
  - I knew I liked this baby. 
  - I know. 
  [INSECTS CHIRPING] 
  Okay the little chiquito is asleep. 
  Great. 
  Great. 
  Hey, Susan got a hit on our baby's DNA and the last known address of the mom. 
  Don't know if she's still living there, - but we'll check it out in the morning. 
  - Good. 
  - Okay. 
  - [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  "Remma. 
  " - What's that? 
  - It's, uh, Ray and Emma's couple name. 
  - "Remma. 
  " - I like that. 
  - It's catchy. 
  - That's adorable. 
  No, it's not catchy. 
  What are you having fun? 
  - Is this fun for you? 
  - Yeah, yeah. 
  All right, y'all, I found these in the fridge. 
  - I don't know how good they are. 
  - WILL: Ooh. 
  They got pictures of Gorbachev on them. 
  Yeah, that's Lenin. 
  Read a book, will you? 
  Whatever. 
  It's Will's birthday, and we gotta celebrate, 'cause it may be one of the last ones. 
  - He's that old. 
  - Hey, watch it. 
  Um, you have the biggest heart of anyone I know. 
  To Will. 
  - Thank you. 
  - [CHUCKLING] 
  Mm-hmm. 
  STANDISH: [GROANS] 
  - Oh, God! 
  - SUSAN: Oh! 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Oh, that did not age well. 
  Oh, how's it ice cold yet still tastes warm? 
  - Mnh. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - Seriously, Jai? 
  - Huh? 
  - Oh, my God. 
  - Really? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Hey, I'm, uh I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier. 
  It's It's unforgivable. 
  So Happy birthday, dork. 
  Thank you. 
  And I appreciate you not making a big deal out of it. 
  It makes me uncomfortable. 
  You know Yeah, of course. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  [SNIFFLES] 
  - Happy birthday to you - Mm! 
  STANDISH: To you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Will Happy birthday to you As a group, I despise you all. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  WILL: So, Standish has been monitoring e-mails and police chatter, but Vlad's disappeared. 
  Good news is Susan's contact found a lead. 
  Hopefully, Baby Will's mom will help us smoke him out. 
  Mm, Simona Borisov, and her house isn't too far. 
  - It's the perfect excuse for a morning walk. 
  - Mm. 
  She's probably not gonna let you call him "Baby Will," though. 
  Mm. 
  We'll see. 
  When Ray and Emma have a baby, maybe they'll let you call it Will. 
  Why do we have to do this? 
  This isn't fun for either one of us. 
  Because you're the only one who hasn't taken a turn. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - What are you doing? 
  Uh, Frankie wanted me to go into town, see if there was any police checkpoints looking for us, so I thought I would combine that with my morning run. 
  Want to come? 
  Get some exercise? 
  No. 
  [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
  Why aren't you watching the baby? 
  I did. 
  It drank stuff. 
  I waved the bear at it. 
  It's fine. 
  You gotta stop calling the baby "it," man. 
  He's a baby. 
  What's wrong with you? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Okay You know how sometimes I can be particular or fastidious or critical when things aren't going just exactly the way that I want? 
  Sometimes or all the time, always? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Well, that's why I won't ever have kids. 
  No child deserves to grow up with a father like that. 
  It's not fair to them. 
  [SIGHS] 
  All right, man, I'll tag in for you. 
  But you've changed a lot in the little time I've known you. 
  I wouldn't close any doors. 
  He needs a diaper change, doesn't he? 
  He does. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  All right, stinky butt, let's do it. 
  I'm just being real. 
  You have to at least consider the fact that Ray and Emma are already in love, right? 
  [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] 
  You know how you've gotten a little more playful and fun - since we started working together? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah, I hate it. 
  - Mm.

  He's in a safe place. 
  Oh, my God, thank you. 
  We can bring him to you, but why do you have a gun? 
  Vladimir. 
  He cames here, he take Kosta, like he takes everyone he wants selling. 
  Next time, he take me. 
  Why didn't you tell anyone? 
  Who do I tell? 
  He is police. 
  There's nobody to help.

  [SPITS] 
  You should have killed him. 
  Remind me to never piss off a Bulgarian woman, huh? 
  Do you have somewhere you can go and hide? 
  My sister in Sofia. 
  Okay, you tell us where, and we'll meet you there with your son. 
  He's fine, but we need to make sure you're both safe. 
  I'm never safe if Vlad is alive. 
  You must stop him. 
  We will.

  Where's this baby you've been talking about?" Hi, Mr. Bear. 
  This is him. 
  He's right here. 
  Would you like to meet him? 
  "Well, yeah. 
  I mean, why else you think I'm here?" Well Well, you Well, see, we're in the woods, so I figured you'd live here. 
  "I know he did not. 
  " "So, just 'cause I'm a bear, I gotta live in the woods, huh? 
  You racist! 
  I'm a city bear!" What's under your collar? 
  "Well, that can't be good. 
  " No, Mr. 
  Bear, it cannot. 
  [WHISPERS] 
  I'll be right back. 
  - [DOOR CREAKS] 
  - Hey, guys, I think I found something. 
  [SMOOCHES] 
  Oh, hey! 
  Oh hey. 
  Now, if I were you, I would be careful. 
  I got a lot of friends around here, and they are badasses. 
  [POLISH ACCENT] 
  Yeah, super badasses. 
  Jai. 
  Jai! 
  He is unconscious. 
  Mnh. 
  Where's the baby? 
  What baby? 
  This is mine. 
  - Martyna, enough. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  This isn't gonna go well, is it? 
  All right. 
  [GRUNTS] 
  [BABY CRYING] 
  WILL: Just let me know when the mother is safe. 
  Bye, Ray. 
  [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
  Hey, so, Ray's having the mom put in protective custody. 
  He, uh He also told me not to worry about Emma being alone and that "he's got my back," which is cool, I guess. 
  Oh, yeah, you sound psyched about it. 
  Yeah. 
  Um, I'm just gonna call Emma real quick. 
  - Dude. 
  - Huh? 
  - What are you doing? 
  - It's not a big deal. 
  I'm just gonna call her and say "hi," maybe, you know, find out what's going on there. 
  You dial, and I'll shoot you. 
  - That's aggressive. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  You call her, you're just telling Emma that you don't trust her. 
  She is not Gigi She's not some 23-year-old girl bouncing from you and Ray because it's fun to make two very old guys look like idiots. 
  Okay, "very old" feels like piling on Listen, she's great. 
  She's a little tiny for my taste, but she's great. 
  Don't screw it up. 
  If there's one thing that you've taught me, it's that you shouldn't stop trusting someone until they give you a reason to. 
  You're right, yes. 
  I'll put this away. 
  Thank you. 
  Mm. 
  Okay. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I don't know what I was thinking. 
  - It's just - Happens. 
  - [SUSAN GROANING] 
  - Susan? 
  Hey, hey, what happened? 
  - I got attacked. 
  - What? 
  - Yeah. 
  I'm okay. 
  - Vlad. 
  The baby. 
  Great, you're here. 
  RAY: Hey, one sec. 
  This mission isn't exactly on the books. 
  I don't want to lose the deposit on this motor home. 
  And What's up? 
  I got you something. 
  It's a book. 
  Oh, there's no words Close call. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  It's a journal. 
  It is a journal. 
  Thank you. 
  When I feel like I want to try and change something about myself, I find that writing things down is helpful. 
  Well, what would I want to change about myself? 
  Never mind. 
  I'm going down a list in my mind. 
  Look, what you said yesterday about running away as if you're on fire, that really struck a chord. 
  - It did? 
  - Yeah, that used to be me. 
  Always going after unattainable partners and sabotaging friendships, and then trying to "I'm sorry" my way out of it. 
  Sound familiar? 
  Whoa. 
  I should be writing this down. 
  In a journal like the one you just [CHUCKLING] 
  gave me. 
  - That - That's right. 
  Thank you. 
  You're very welcome. 
  What the hell happened? 
  Martyna happened. 
  She took the baby. 
  What? 
  Uh, I-is everybody okay? 
  Oh, my neck's fine. 
  My pride's hurt. 
  I told you Super powers. 
  This is Vlad cleaning up loose ends. 
  I can't believe that hot girl kicked all our asses. 
  - The what? 
  - What now? 
  - What is wrong with you? 
  - She tried to kill us. 
  Did she, though? 
  'Cause, like, we're all alive, so I'll drop it. 
  All right, guys, we're gonna get that baby back. 
  - How did she find us? 
  - There was a thing on the teddy bear. 
  - Tracker? 
  - Did Martyna take the teddy bear with her? 
  Either that or he went back to the city. 
  Couldn't you reverse-trace the signal to locate them? 
  - Worth a shot. 
  - No, that only works if she was dumb enough - to leave the tracker on - I found her. 
  Wow, she's that dumb. 
  All right, let's get this thing back on the road. 
  Well, for a second, it was a fun trip. 
  Hey, we find Tyna, and she'll lead us to Vlad and Baby Will. 
  All right, there she is. 
  Take it slow. 
  She's just standing there. 
  I don't see a gun. 
  Yeah, she could probably take you out with that teddy bear.

  What took you so long? 
  So, we're supposed to believe that you're Tina Marek? 
  - From Brooklyn? 
  - Marek Brighton Beach, born and raised. 
  Look, I'm telling the truth. 
  How come we can't find any official records of any agency assignments, then? 
  I could ask your little team the same question. 
  I'm C. I. A. 
  I've been given the freedom to operate under deep cover for years. 
  Must be nice. 
  - It is. 
  - [DOOR OPENS] 
  She mostly checks out. 
  I confirmed special ops records, but deep-cover missions are classified. 
  Looks like we gotta take her at her word. 
  Or not. 
  Okay, why do you think I left the tracker on? 
  Do you really think I'm that dumb? 
  Ooh, I can't say yet. 
  We just met. 
  I did it because I need backup to take Vlad down. 
  But why take the baby? 
  Because Vlad asked me to. 
  Being his number two is my cover. 
  Look, we don't have time for this. 
  He's spooked and packing up his whole operation. 
  You want to save that baby and a whole bunch of other children? 
  We have to act now. 
  Stay here. 
  Funny. 
  Spy humor. 
  So, it looks like Tina is on our side. 
  Yes! 
  New team member! 
  What's up?! 
  Uh, look, Tina wants us to help her take down Vlad. 
  If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it our way. 
  She is not in charge, okay? 
  Let's hit it. 
  I'm driving. 
  - Okay. 
  - We're gonna get those kids out. 
  She was handcuffed. 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  Yeah, I like her. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Me too. 
  We know.

  So, which government should I send your bodies to? 
  You can kill us. 
  It won't matter. 
  We're just the tip of the spear. 
  The United States government knows all about your operations, and now that your idiot friend brought us here, they'll know exactly where to send the troops for your extradition to the Hague.

  Oh, good, Frankie, you made a friend.

  Hey, guys, guys, great news. 
  All the kids are gonna be reunited with their families, and because Vlad was operating across borders, he'll be tried by an international tribune for violating human rights. 
  He's gonna spend the rest of his worthless life in prison. 
  That's exactly what that big bad man deserves, isn't it? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yes, it is. 
  Yes, it is!
