 Previously on "Whiskey Cavalier" Did you just shut off the power grid? 
  Yes, ma'am. 
  You want to cause a traffic jam? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah? 
  I'm just hoping, if I hang around long enough, that someday, Will will forgive me and let me back in. 
  [GUNSHOT] 
  [STAMMERS] 
  [SCREAMS] 
  WILL: Here's the thing. 
  You're never gonna stop being scared. 
  What makes a good agent is the ability to push through that fear and get the job done when everything's at stake. 
  And I know you can do that. 
  - [ENGINE REVVING, TIRES SCREECHING] 
  - [ENGINE REVVING, STANDISH SCREAMING] 
  Too fast! 
  Too fast! 
  You keep saying the same thing over and over again. 
  Yeah, 'cause it's too fast! 
  [LAUGHS] 
  [ENGINES REVVING] 
  [CHEERING] 
  Good morning. 
  Whew! 
  I'm still waking up. 
  Hey, you know, I'd be, uh, I'd be racing myself, but those rally cars, they're really built for people under 5 feet tall. 
  I'm 5'8". 
  That's above average. 
  You wish you were 5'8". 
  Watch the road! 
  [STRAINS] 
  Okay, guys, focus. 
  Alexi Yogin, the bio-terrorist you're grabbing, only leaves Moscow for these things. 
  He's in the car right in front of you. 
  [ENGINES REVVING] 
  [CHEERING] 
  Guys, I know we're on mission, but I think I can actually win this. 
  - Permission to win? 
  - WILL: No. 
  Sorry. 
  It looks like Alexi's got a security team at the finish line. 
  You're gonna have to take him out on the course. 
  Ooh, fun. 
  - [GEARSHIFT CLICKING] 
  - Do what now?! 
  [TIRES SQUEALING] 
  [CHEERING] 
  Whoo-hoo! 
  [GROANING] 
  Standish, you said you wanted more field experience. 
  Come on. 
  Here it is. 
  I take it back! 
  [CHEERING] 
  [TIRES SCREECH] 
  [GROANING] 
  [TIRES SQUEALING] 
  Whooooo! 
  [ENGINES REVVING] 
  All right, hold on. 
  Our friend's onto us. 
  He's going off-road. 
  [TIRES SQUEAL, GEARSHIFT CLICKS] 
  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
  Look, if I'm gonna die in this damn car, you better not lose his ass. 
  Attaboy. 
  - So proud! 
  - Right? 
  Yeah. 
  [ENGINES REV] 
  FRANKIE: Here's your shot. 
  Take it! 
  - Ram him. 
  - All right. 
  Yeah. 
  Here we go. 
  Come on. 
  [STRAINING] 
  Here we go! 
  [ENGINE REVS] 
  Oh. 
  Okay. 
  Interesting choice. 
  [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] 
  [GROANING] 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  Alexi, let me see your hands! 
  In the air! 
  [GRUNTS] 
  Standish, what are you doing? 
  I think he's hurt. 
  [WEAKLY] 
  Please help. 
  Do not approach the asset! 
  - Standish - Standish My leg's broken. 
  Standish, no! 
  Think! 
  Relax! 
  Obviously, he broke his leg. 
  [GROANS] 
  [GRUNTS] 
  My bad. 
  I need to know now Know now Can you love me again? 
  I need to know now Know now Can you love me again? 
  Can you love me again? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Look, if you wanna be mad at someone, be mad at him. 
  He's the one who shot the asset! 
  Uh, yeah to save your life. 
  Look, Jai, I think we're all getting a little tired of your excuses. 
  I [SCOFFS] 
  Thank you for saving my life. 
  My mom thanks you, too. 
  All right. 
  We got to go get our mission from Ray. 
  Looks like, uh, you're coming along. 
  Oh, come on, man. 
  Am I in trouble? 
  I thought Alexi was hurt. 
  I just wanted to help. 
  Hey, look, it's normal to feel for another human - when they're in pain. 
  - [SCOFFS] 
  You'd have to be a sociopath not to. 
  That's your cue. 
  If I was there, after I shot Alexi, - I would have shot you! 
  - There it is. 
  So you would've killed me for a mistake. 
  No. 
  I would have put one in the leg to teach you a lesson! 
  Mm-hmm. 
  - [SIGHING] 
  Okay. 
  - Wow. 
  Just the leg? 
  You're showing a lot of personal growth. 
  I'm proud of you, Frankie. 
  I'm trying. 
  [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
  Ray, is everything okay? 
  Yeah. 
  I'm great. 
  Why? 
  Oh. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'm, um watching my niece for the weekend, and she likes to play dress-up. 
  Uncle Ray, can I put lipstick on you later? 
  [INHALES SHARPLY] 
  Mm I'm gonna answer this one. 
  Yes. 
  Yes! 
  Joke's on you. 
  I look great in lipstick. 
  Do you? 
  So, the team's new target is Kim Yong Son. 
  He's an engineering prodigy at Bucharest Technical Institute. 
  He's spent years studying maglev technology, which harnesses EMF propulsion fields. 
  C-Can we have that in English, please, Ray? 
  They're using magnets to move stuff. 
  Oh. 
  Why didn't you just say that? 
  Well, I would've if I understood it, but I didn't, so I couldn't. 
  Anyway, Yong claims to be working on a new high-speed railway system. 
  Yeah, I studied maglev propulsion at MIT. 
  That technology has military applications. 
  Bingo! 
  His country's military wants to use his research to build long-range missiles. 
  We're not sure if Yong even knows. 
  That puts every ally, including the U. S. , within a dictator's striking distance. 
  It reshapes the balance of power. 
  See? 
  That time, I explained it good. 
  Okay, just one question why am I here? 
  Well, we need to retrieve Yong's data before it falls into the wrong hands. 
  And convince him to defect. 
  So the team's going back to college! 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  Hey. 
  And you are going undercover as Yong's new roommate, which means you, my friend, are running point. 
  What?! 
  That's a horrible idea. 
  Hey, let's let's be supportive here. 
  Ray, it's not a great idea. 
  I can hear both of y'all. 
  Like, I'm in the room with you. 
  - We know. 
  - Wait. 
  So why me? 
  Well, for one thing, you speak nerd. 
  So you two can talk about maglev-propulsion whatever, okay? 
  And also, look, you're the only guy on the team that can pass as a college student. 
  Mm I can still pass as a grad student. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  [LAUGHING] 
  Is he serious? 
  [LAUGHTER CONTINUES] 
  Okay. 
  Is that it, Ray? 
  Anything else? 
  No. 
  Whew! 
  Uh, here's your covers. 
  - That was good, Will. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  - Good luck. 
  Come on. 
  I got a baby face. 
  I can - [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  - That's rich. 
  Let's make you a princess. 
  Oh, boy. 
  I've e-mailed you your course schedule. 
  You're placed in most of Yong's classes. 
  Will and I will also be on campus, as professors. 
  I love that we get to go back to college. 
  I mean, it was the happiest times of my life. 
  You guys think I'm cool now No one thinks you're cool now. 
  I think you're totally cool. 
  Thank you, Standish. 
  But I could be wrong. 
  Better I play both sides. 
  Getting ahold of Yong's research is gonna be hard, but getting him to defect, that's gonna be even harder. 
  I mean, we don't know where his allegiance lies. 
  We don't even know if he's interested. 
  You need to get close to Yong fast. 
  You two have a lot in common. 
  You're both giant nerds. 
  Get him to trust you, ask him about his personal life No offense, Frankie, but are you telling me how to make a friend? 
  Oh, he's, uh, he's implying that you've never made a friend. 
  Uh, I made a friend just recently. 
  Name him. 
  Keith. 
  Keith who? 
  Richards. 
  No, that's the lead guitarist for The Rolling Stones. 
  Okay. 
  I'm gonna go pack. 
  Hey, before you go, uh, there's something that's not in the dossier that should be. 
  It's how much I believe in you. 
  Oh, God. 
  Come on. 
  Bring it in. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [WHISPERING] 
  I really do think you're cool. 
  I know. 
  Everybody does. 
  You go get 'em, huh? 
  What is with this touchy-feely crap? 
  You're gonna make him soft! 
  I'm just trying to boost his self-esteem, okay? 
  I've trained a bunch of newbie agents. 
  All they need to know is there's a support system there. 
  No, they don't. 
  They need tough love. 
  They need to know that if they make a mistake, millions of people will die and it's all their fault. 
  You should work with children. 
  Really? 
  No. 
  Okay. 
  At college, I will be - "Dr. Vijay Parikh. 
  " - Ooh. 
  "Visiting fellow from Berkeley, researching astrophysics. 
  " - Ooh! 
  - Oh, I like mine. 
  "Carmen Veracruz, sexy psych professor. 
  " [CHUCKLES] 
  What, it says "sexy" on the page? 
  No. 
  I added that. 
  But it's accurate. 
  No argument here. 
  We are We have these a-and books for our course, s-so we're set. 
  Ah! 
  Reading for the plane! 
  Daah! 
  No! 
  I'm sorry. 
  Just Don't open that, please. 
  Jai, it's a book. 
  Yes, but inside the book are really sensitive micro cameras for on-site surveillance. 
  So if we put these in all of Yong's classes, we can watch him around the clock. 
  - [DOOR OPENS] 
  - That is so cool! 
  - I did that. 
  - Nice! 
  - Hey, party people! 
  - Hi, Ray. 
  We just got some new intel on Yong. 
  Turns out his country sent a handler along to watch his every move. 
  You guys need to figure out who that is and take him down. 
  Understood. 
  Thanks, Ray. 
  All right. 
  Okay, you're not leaving. 
  Feels like you guys need an extra body, you know? 
  Someone with field experience, someone who knows the team, someone who doesn't want to babysit his niece anymore. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Are you serious, Ray? 
  - Look at my nails. 
  - [BOTH LAUGH] 
  No. 
  N-No, no That's not [CHUCKLES] 
  Look, she wants to pluck my brows next, all right? 
  I don't care if I get shot. 
  Just please, take me with you. 
  Do you really think you could pass for a college professor? 
  Not a chance in hell. 
  Hmm. 
  Uh but I could be a football coach. 
  - If I had my time again - I would do it all the same [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  And not change a single thing [CAMERA CLICKS] 
  Thanks so much. 
  Ah, sweet! 
  I wanted a group photo of us on campus. 
  [SIGHING] 
  Oh, college. 
  Take it in, you guys. 
  Full of knowledge and ambition. 
  Sports and beer. 
  Walks of shame. 
  Okay, enough Memory Lane, everybody. 
  Yong's research puts millions in danger. 
  - We have to move fast. 
  - Relax. 
  I'm gonna have Yong and his research wrapped up in a bow like that. 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  [SNIFFS] 
  Hey. 
  I'm Reggie. 
  How you doing? 
  I'm-a tell you how you're doing. 
  You're doing great. 
  Because Reggie is now your roommate. 
  Reggie the Roommate, coming through. 
  We need to come up with a cool handshake. 
  - How you feel about that? 
  - Can you hand me those headphones? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Here you go. 
  You know I can see those aren't plugged in, right? 
  Yes, I know. 
  Okay. 
  All right. 
  Look, it's okay, Standish. 
  It was a bit of a rocky start, but everything is gonna be just fine. 
  Now, remember that Yong is from an oppressed country, so he you know, he'd probably love a roommate who can show him how to have a little bit of fun. 
  Come on, you've got this, man. 
  I got this. 
  Hey, man! 
  We're gonna have a great semester together. 
  Uh-oh. 
  Watch out. 
  Incoming. 
  Excuse me, we're looking for the class with beautiful women and amazing smiles. 
  You two obviously know where that is, right? 
  [WOMEN CHUCKLE] 
  Hey, you want to, like, meet up with them later? 
  Go to a bar or something? 
  Do other people find you funny? 
  I'd like to think so. 
  They're wrong. 
  All right. 
  Good morning. 
  How's everyone feeling? 
  A little anxious? 
  Well, don't be. 
  Welcome to Abnormal Psychology. 
  [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  Okay! 
  I'm gonna start by learning everyone's name. 
  Good morning! 
  My name is Dr. 
  Parikh. 
  Your names are not important. 
  This is the research lab component of your respective majors. 
  I expect you to be diligent, focused, perfect. 
  I don't take questions. 
  Let's begin. 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  Sick laptop you got there, man. 
  You know, if you want to maximize your performance, discrete graphics chips beat integrated GPUs every time. 
  [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
  You play "Fortnite"? 
  I've been Video games are the reason people are getting dumber. 
  I saw you playing in our room. 
  Now you're just being mean. 
  He's just being mean, right? 
  Not gonna offer me none? 
  Okay. 
  It's cool. 
  - [DOOR CLOSES] 
  - Good morning, everybody! 
  Good morning! 
  Hello! 
  Hello. 
  My name is, uh, Professor Hewson. 
  This is Professor Brenner. 
  We will be co-lecturing on Gender Roles and Sexuality in Classic Literature. 
  So, where to start? 
  With female characters, you're either a damsel in distress or you get killed. 
  Lecture over. 
  Thanks, everybody. 
  - [LAUGHTER] 
  - Okay, Amy, I don't think that's fair. 
  I mean, classic literature is full of modernized takes on sexuality. 
  I'm kind of an expert. 
  Yeah, well, those who can't do teach. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  Okay, I-I think She's the fun one in the group. 
  Y I can do. 
  Trust me, I can I can do and do. 
  I mean, I-I I'm not gonna do right here in front of the class - Thank God. 
  - But Look, uh, take Charlotte Bronte's, uh, "Jane Eyre," All right? 
  In a time of sexual repression, she gave us a female protagonist who doggedly pursued her innermost carnal desires. 
  I mean, that's That, I like. 
  I thought you would. 
  STUDENT: Just kiss her already! 
  - Okay. 
  - Oooh! 
  Oooh! 
  Oooh! 
  Oooh! 
  Thank you. 
  all right, everybody. 
  - Guys, take out your syllabuses, please. 
  - The tension's in the air. 
  You can't feel that? 
  The first bullet point is is "Ulysses" by Joyce. 
  [SIGHING] 
  I don't know what I'm doing. 
  WILL: Good first lecture. 
  Well, I'm glad to say that in this hour, we determined that, "A," we can all read and, "B," that we are all sexual creatures. 
  Now, go home. 
  I'll see you on Wednesday. 
  And focus on one of those two. 
  Goodbye, everybody. 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  Hey. 
  I just wanted you to know I really, really enjoyed your lecture. 
  Oh, thank you. 
  I-I really, really appreciate that. 
  Good. 
  Uh, would you like to meet Professor Brenner? 
  Hi. 
  Nah. 
  I'm good. 
  Bye. 
  And that's why I hated college. 
  All right, Yong, I'll check you later. 
  Hope not. 
  [SIGHS DEEPLY] 
  Thank you. 
  - How's it going up there? 
  - Not great. 
  I know. 
  We all know. 
  I got to ask you - [DOOR CLOSES] 
  - what if I can't connect with Yong? 
  What if I can't get him to defect? 
  Don't worry. 
  We'll just switch to another tactic. 
  We'll still need to obtain his research, and since Yong can just re-create it all, he'll either be abducted or we'll take him out. 
  Take him out? 
  W-What are you doing? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Your teddy bear tactics aren't working. 
  Tough love time. 
  Look, we can't kill him. 
  He's a jerk, yeah, but he's just a kid. 
  Tell me we're not gonna kill him. 
  Look at me. 
  Nobody on our team is going to kill Yong. 
  Thank God. 
  Wait, what about another team? 
  - [CLICKS TONGUE] 
  Nnh. 
  - You want the truth? 
  That kid's creating a lethal weapon, so you need to connect with him ASAP. 
  Eliminate that threat by getting him to switch sides or he's probably going to die. 
  Get it? 
  Yeah. 
  Get to work. 
  All right, I got this. 
  Now he has a fire under him. 
  That's how you train an agent. 
  Yeah. 
  Great job. 
  You know, he's, um he's on comms. 
  I can hear him throwing up in the hallway. 
  Well "Well"? 
  Scare the puke out of the kid. 
  [WHISTLE BLOWS] 
  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
  [GRUNTS] 
  [WHISTLE BLOWS] 
  Nice, Tomas! 
  Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! 
  [LAUGHS] 
  I got to tell you, when I volunteered to be the club rugby coach, I, uh I didn't know a thing about the game. 
  Now, I'm a little fuzzy on the rules still, so, uh, today, we're gonna start with the basics, and that's posing for the team picture. 
  This is how we did it in football, so listen up. 
  Need a wide stance. 
  Hands behind your back. 
  Thick neck that's the key. 
  Thick as you can make it. 
  Dead in the eyes. 
  If you're wondering what's going through my mind, it's absolutely nothing just a bunch of clicks and buzzes. 
  Now, let's go! 
  Come on, now! 
  Think "Thick neck"! 
  Thick neck! 
  Everybody! 
  Thick as you can make it! 
  Ooh, easy. 
  Easy, there, son. 
  Just a thick neck. 
  You look like you're gonna squirt your shorts. 
  You know, there's a lot of big guys out here. 
  You'd better be fast, or you're gonna get killed. 
  When my government allowed me to come here to study, they required me to get physical activity at least once a week. 
  Fun government. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Oh, looks like your big friend's checking on you. 
  Uh I don't know him. 
  Oh, well, let's work on your picture neck. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, thick. 
  Looks good. 
  Looks good. 
  Thicker. 
  SUSAN: Well, whoever the handler is, he'll be around Yong all the time. 
  I got a list from the registrar of all the students who share more than one class with Yong. 
  I've been going through all the footage I got from my textbook cams. 
  All we got to do is crosscheck it against the names and see if anyone's behaving suspiciously. 
  I have been watching this for a long time. 
  I'm reminded of the fact that college was really boring. 
  - Are you kidding? 
  - Mnh-mnh. 
  College is filled with drama. 
  Yeah, look. 
  The one getting extra help from her professor? 
  [LAUGHS] 
  That is more than "extra help. 
  " Look at her. 
  She's batting her eyelashes. 
  She's just laughing so much. 
  No chemistry professor is that charming. 
  - That is a lot of touching. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Are they sleeping together? 
  Oh, yeah. 
  And look at his hand. 
  That is a wedding ring. 
  - Uh-huh. 
  - He is married! 
  This is a bad man. 
  A ba Ooh, a bad man. 
  - Anyway, enough of her. 
  - [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
  - Oh, no! 
  - Yes, yes! 
  This is the student that I'm interested in Park Lin. 
  Ooh, yeah, I just met that guy. 
  He seemed very aware of Yong. 
  What are you wearing? 
  Oh, this is my new rugby jersey. 
  I love this sport. 
  Tomas says I'm a natural hooker. 
  That's a rugby position. 
  Unless he's playing a very mean trick on me. 
  - All right, hang on. 
  - [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
  Park Lin 3. 
  0 GPA, born in Seoul, very little social media Wait. 
  He joined college late 'cause he's former military. 
  Fits the profile. 
  - Let's keep an eye on him. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] 
  - Now, as the world's youngest recipient of the no talking Wrexham Williams Prize for physics innovation, I am uniquely qualified to judge what is in the nascent brain. 
  In yours, nothing. 
  Carry on. 
  Now, some of you might be wondering, "If we leave our lab stations messy, does he just come in in the middle of the night and throw all of our stuff away?" I do! 
  And I'm not sorry. 
  In fact, if it's expensive [MUFFLED] 
  I'll keep it. 
  Hey. 
  Look at this kid. 
  Still testing Gaussian lasers, like we're in high school. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  What are you working on? 
  Oh, what is that maglev technology? 
  I've dabbled. 
  Worked with superconducting electromagnets to minimize friction and make transport more efficient. 
  Need some help? 
  I'd appreciate it if you didn't bother yourself - with my work. 
  - [LOCK BEEPING] 
  [SIGHS DEEPLY] 
  Okay. 
  Yong has left the building, and Standish is still whiffing. 
  Standish, are you trying to get your roommate killed? 
  [WHISPERING] 
  No. 
  I'm trying to bond with him over science, like you said. 
  I've also tried fun, humor, and just all-around being awesome, but none of them is working, so get off my back, Frankie. 
  I'm not on your back. 
  She's definitely on your back. 
  It's, uh, it's too much. 
  Oh, good. 
  Will's here. 
  You know why I'm so stressed? 
  Because you put his life on my shoulders, and that's just too much pressure for any human being. 
  It's like my head's in a vise, and you just keep turning it and turning it - and turning it and turning it - Standish! 
  - and turning it - Standish. 
  and turning it and turning it till you can't turn it no more. 
  But then you turn it one more time, just to crack it. 
  - Yeah. 
  - And you want to see if you can crack me. 
  Well, you're not gonna crack me, Frankie. 
  You're not doing it. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Hey, I know I got here late, but, uh, how's that tough love working out? 
  Look, I know you don't like to admit this, but you and I both care about Standish, right? 
  Yeah. 
  So, then, let's work together and help him. 
  Fine. 
  Fine. 
  Hey, yo, Yong! 
  Yong! 
  Man, we got to talk. 
  Of course. 
  'Cause I'm the only one you ever talk to. 
  No. 
  I just finished having an hour-long conversation with the dorm RA about how you want a new roommate because I make you uncomfortable. 
  I was just being honest. 
  You told him I was selling heroin. 
  I said I didn't know for sure. 
  You know what? 
  I'm done with you! 
  I'm done with all of this! 
  If you had any idea why I was trying so hard, you would [CHUCKLES] 
  - [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVS] 
  - You and your pretentious attitude can - Run. 
  - What? 
  [ENGINE REVVING] 
  Run! 
  Whoa! 
  Whoa! 
  Take this! 
  Go over there! 
  [ENGINE REVS] 
  [GRUNTS] 
  Let's go. 
  What the hell's happening?! 
  More running, less talking! 
  [PANTING] 
  Who the hell were they?! 
  All right. 
  You should be safe here. 
  I got people watching the building. 
  What are you talking about?! 
  W-Why did someone try to kill us?! 
  - W-What's going on?! 
  - Hey! 
  Look, I lied, okay. 
  I'm not just the best college roommate ever. 
  I'm also an undercover agent. 
  - Wha - I'll be back to explain more later, but I got to go check in with my team, all right? 
  - Just lock the door behind me. 
  - Oh, wait, wait! 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  A-A-About before sorry if I was being a little abrasive. 
  A little? 
  Yes. 
  My whole life, people have always wanted something from me. 
  I-I just thought you were the same. 
  Anyway [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  thank you for saving my life. 
  It's what I do. 
  It's Reggie time. 
  Oh! 
  There you guys are! 
  Listen, it just got crazy! 
  I got attacked by two assassins and They were dressed ex actly like y'all. 
  Nice job knocking me off my bike. 
  Totally hurt my knee. 
  Oh. 
  Good. 
  I'm glad you got hurt. 
  Because I thought I was going to die! 
  Why did you attack me? 
  It's an old spy trick you get the asset to feel indebted to you because you "saved their life. 
  " It's a quick way to bond. 
  - Oh, it's a quick way to bond. 
  - Good. 
  Yeah. 
  Well, that's insane! 
  Did it work? 
  That's not the point. 
  The point is, you guys need to let me know what the plan is. 
  - Why didn't you? 
  - Needed to seem real. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - You're not a great actor. 
  - Mm. 
  - That's hurtful. 
  You guys made such a big scene. 
  What if we tipped off Yong's handler? 
  Don't worry. 
  We got it taken care of. 
  - Aah! 
  Oh, man. 
  - Oh, God. 
  Are you hurting 'cause you're old? 
  No. 
  I'm not hurting 'cause I'm old. 
  - Ow! 
  Yes! 
  - Ohh! 
  I mean, not 'cause I'm old 'cause I'm Yeah. 
  It's okay. 
  [SIGHING] 
  Oh, man. 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  Park Lin, I need a quick word. 
  Actually, we all need to talk to you. 
  - All three? 
  - [DOOR CLOSES] 
  Well, it's a psychology, science rugby-related matter. 
  It's about your assignment. 
  I turned in my paper. 
  No, no your government assignment. 
  To monitor Yong and his research so you can weaponize it. 
  We read your e-mails. 
  Okay. 
  Before we all start shooting each other, I've got something to say. 
  See, I know you're not a real student. 
  But I did not appreciate you chewing gum in my class. 
  I thought it was rude and disrespectful, and I will not have it. 
  And why does this matter? 
  Oh, it doesn't. 
  I'm just stalling. 
  See, I switched your gum with some gum that I drugged. 
  It should've knocked you out by now. 
  And there it is. 
  Hey, hey, I gotcha, buddy. 
  Ooh! 
  Professor, I had a question about Oh, Park Lin, cheer up! 
  It's one bad grade. 
  You can make it up. 
  Shhhhh. 
  It's okay, buddy. 
  Okay. 
  I'll come back later. 
  Thank you. 
  - [DOOR OPENS] 
  - That's all right. 
  Woof! 
  [THUD] 
  - He was heavy. 
  - [BOTH LAUGH] 
  Ooh! 
  Gum. 
  - Oh! 
  - Aah! 
  No, Ray! 
  That is, uh sleepy gum. 
  Oh, right! 
  'Cause Right. 
  I-I don't understand. 
  All my research is dedicated to building a faster magnetic railway system in my country. 
  Your country plans on using your technology to develop long-range weapons. 
  [SIGHS HEAVILY] 
 
 
 
  This isn't fair. 
  I-I just wanted to help people. 
  I know. 
  Look, Yong Oh Geez. 
  STANDISH: Here. 
  [GRUNTS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  So old. 
  This isn't your fault, all right? 
  You didn't do anything wrong. 
  Yet. 
  I don't want to be involved with anything that hurts people. 
  H-How can I help? 
  Well, we need to get our hands on your research. 
  And then we need to have a conversation about you defecting. 
  I have to defect? 
  That's why I was trying so hard to connect with you. 
  Frankie even tried to motivate me by pretending she would kill you. 
  "Pretending"? 
  - Shh. 
  - Okay. 
  So, what do you say, man? 
  What now? 
  We go to the lab and get my research. 
  Good choice. 
  The cheating professor and his undergrad lover is my new favorite soap. 
  I can't stop watching. 
  The professor just offered her a glass of wine in the classroom, and she declined. 
  But she loves wine. 
  [BOTH GASP] 
  - She's pregnant! 
  - She's pregnant! 
  But but I-I pulled up his medical records. 
  - He's had a vasectomy. 
  - Yeah. 
  It's not his baby. 
  - [GASPS] 
  - Not his baby. 
  That makes sense! 
  It's always someone else. 
  It's just never as obvious. 
  [MUGS CLINK] 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  - I'm so happy. 
  You know, it makes me think. 
  Park being Yong's handler is pretty obvious, too. 
  Yeah, I mean, it was almost too easy. 
  He didn't even try to hide the fact that he was following Yong around. 
  If Yong is such an important asset, do you really think they'd only send one person? 
  Well, if it was me, I'd have somebody else deep undercover for backup. 
  I will pull up our list of names. 
  I'll pull up the footage. 
  Until later, professor. 
  You old heartbroken fool, you. 
  Yes, obviously, you accomplished amazing things at MI in the computer-science field. 
  But I'm just saying, I'm still smarter than you. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  I respect that. 
  Believing in yourself and whatnot. 
  All I'm saying is, no, you're not. 
  [KEYPAD BEEPING] 
  bitch. 
  [BOTH LAUGH] 
  Oh, so, now you think I'm funny? 
  See, you can't just judge smarts by I. Q. 
  - [LOCK BEEPS] 
  - or whether or not you can build a superweapon. 
  No. 
  What? 
  My hard drive is gone. 
  That was all my research. 
  Okay, I got to let my team know. 
  [CELLPHONE CLICKING] 
  Oh Looks like that kid left his laser project on. 
  Get down! 
  [GLASS BREAKING] 
  - Go. 
  Go! 
  - [GUNSHOTS] 
  You know, you should really consider transferring. 
  You had me worried. 
  Are you okay, kiddo? 
  Yeah, we're good. 
  Yong's packing up now, then we're heading there. 
  Okay, yeah. 
  Stay safe. 
  Look, Frankie wants to say "hi. 
  " Okay. 
  Don't get killed. 
  Hi, Frankie. 
  Went back through the records and cross-referenced all the students in Yong's classes with new transfers. 
  We got three hits. 
  Park who's upstairs, being interrogated. 
  Reginald "Reggie" Kensington that's Standish. 
  Picked his own cover name. 
  - 'Course he did. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  And this woman Claire Bisset. 
  Former French intelligence, now freelance gun for hire. 
  I knew her flirty thing had to be an act. 
  Man! 
  I was so excited that college girls still thought I was cute. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Do you wish I never found out, and eventually, she shot you in the head? 
  Part of me does, Susan. 
  Yeah. 
  Part of me does. 
  The second she uploads that research off that hard drive, we're done. 
  Mission's failed. 
  To transfer a file that big, she's gonna need a high-speed connection T3 or higher. 
  Well, we already looked. 
  The only place on campus with enough bandwidth is the library. 
  Great. 
  You guys get going. 
  We'll wait here for Standish and Yong so we can take him to the State Department - and start processing his defection. 
  - Okay. 
  Oh, hey, Susan. 
  Uh, if you get a chance to question Claire make sure to ask her, you know, if the flirting was was an act or not. 
  [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
  I'm embarrassed for you. 
  I'm okay with it. 
  [MAN GROANS] 
  I don't believe it. 
  I'm telling you, man, that's my girlfriend. 
  But she's so hot. 
  Thank you, boy I've never met. 
  I'd love to talk, but I'm kind of in the middle of something. 
  - [GUNSHOT] 
  - Get your ass on the ground! 
  I'll see you at home, boo. 
  [SMOOCHES] 
  You're so lucky. 
  Yeah, she fine. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'm not really good with people. 
  I don't really have a lot of friends. 
  Well, wait till you get to the States, man. 
  You don't know how your life will turn out. 
  I don't know. 
  This is all happening so fast. 
  You're not having second thoughts about defecting? 
  I got a text. 
  My supervisors are upset that they don't have my research yet. 
  They're sending a team to pick me up. 
  You're not gonna go with them, are you? 
  What's the point? 
  As long as I'm alive, they'll keep coming for me. 
  But we can keep you safe. 
  Besides, they're just gonna make you build more weapons. 
  Can you promise me your country won't? 
  It's usually easy for me to find the answers, but this is just a lot. 
  Look, man, I hear you, all right? 
  I've been exactly where you are. 
  Since taking this gig, I've been in over my head and not sure who I can trust. 
  And I'm pretty sure one of my new friends would shoot me if she got annoyed enough. 
  Your girlfriend? 
  I actually meant Frankie, but yeah, no, that applies to her, too. 
  What should I do? 
  I don't know. 
  All I can really do is stand in front of you, look you in the eye, and tell you that I'm your friend and I got your back. 
  You just got to decide whether or not you trust me. 
  Thank you, Reggie. 
  [INHALES SHARPLY] 
  It's actually "Standish. 
  " But we good from here on. 
  From here, nothing but truth. 
  I like "Reggie" better. 
  I don't know, guys. 
  Maybe she's just a normal college co-ed studying with three muscular assassins. 
  [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
  JAI: This is odd. 
  The outbound connection isn't going to Yong's government. 
  It's going to Moscow. 
  She's double-crossing them selling it for profit. 
  SUSAN: Oh, Claire. 
  The minute she came into my class, I knew she was a go-getter. 
  Okay, how do we take them? 
  There's too many exits if they try and run. 
  - I got that covered. 
  - All right. 
  [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
  CLAIRE: Okay, so, Dimitri, the money just came through to my account, and I'm starting the transfer of the hard drive now. 
  We got about 30 seconds before their transfer ends. 
  We need to move. 
  - Let's go. 
  - Okay. 
  If you can't take out Claire, grab the hard drive. 
  10 seconds. 
  We're running out of time. 
  Come on. 
  [COMPUTER BEEPS, POWERS DOWN] 
  I did both. 
  In heels. 
  [GRUNTING] 
  Ugh! 
  Nice, Tomas! 
  [LAUGHS] 
  [LAUGHING] 
  I love that guy! 
  [QUIETLY] 
  He's like a 14th-year sophomore or something, but [NORMAL VOICE] 
  Great job, Tomas! 
  So, we got all Yong's data back, and Claire's in custody. 
  Great work. 
  Were you, uh, were you able to get that other information that we needed? 
  I knocked all of Claire's teeth out before I could find out if she really thought you were cute. 
  Hmm. 
  So, I guess we'll never know. 
  Trust me we know. 
  First time running point. 
  You got the database back, and you got an asset to defect. 
  Congrats, Standish. 
  This is a big day. 
  Hey, where's, uh, where's Yong? 
  He's gone. 
  What do you mean he's gone? 
  Yong's government contacted him. 
  I never thought he would go, but then he said he had to go to the bathroom, and then he just bolted before I could do anything, and he just left with them! 
  I-I know he didn't want to go. 
  Oh, you know that? 
  What are you, a mind reader now? 
  No, he's my friend! 
  I know he doesn't want to make weapons for the rest of his life. 
  Maybe Yong played you? 
  He's very smart. 
  No! 
  I-I'm smarter than he is. 
  We already had that fight. 
  I You don't get it. 
  He's just scared! 
  I know where they're taking him. 
  We can go get him right now! 
  No, we can't. 
  Look, he was at a foreign university by himself. 
  That was our window. 
  We are not authorized to engage with foreign agents without orders. 
  Sorry, Standish. 
  It's over. 
  No. 
  It's not. 
  I'm gonna go get him with or without y'all. 
  I'll see y'all later. 
  This is all your fault! 
  He cares about the asset because you coddled him with your hugs and your emotional support! 
  Are you kidding me? 
  This one's on you. 
  You're such a rebel, always doing whatever the hell you want. 
  You made him impulsive. 
  I hope you're happy. 
  Uh, "Mom"? 
  "Dad"? 
  If you're done fighting, we all know you're coming with me to get this, so Fine. 
  This isn't finished. 
  We're talking about this in the car. 
  - - JAI: I just intercepted some military chatter. 
  It says that Yong is being transferred to a military team for extraction. 
  They're gonna have to smuggle him out, so keep your eyes peeled for that other team. 
  I miss your rugby shirt. 
  Yeah, me too. 
  Tomas took it from me when he found out I wasn't a real rugby coach. 
  All right, you heard Ray. 
  We got to get Yong now. 
  Standish, you create a distraction and draw them out. 
  Will and I will light them up. 
  - Ooh. 
  - Yeah, negative. 
  Again, this is not a sanctioned operation. 
  Killing one of them could start a war. 
  - So? 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  So, generally speaking, wars are bad. 
  Fine. 
  I won't shoot anybody. 
  But I'm not gonna like it. 
  No one said you had to. 
  All right, Standish, distraction time. 
  What am I supposed to do? 
  You're on point. 
  You'll figure it out. 
  Yeah. 
  We believe in you. 
  Thanks, guys. 
  Think he bought it? 
  I don't know. 
  Distraction distraction Got to find a distraction. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  All right, Standish. 
  [CRACKLING] 
  Yong! 
  Couldn't let you leave without saying goodbye, man. 
  Standish? 
  - - [OFF-KEY] 
  I will remember you Oh, God. 
  He's singing. 
  Will you remember me? 
  It's Sarah McLachlan! 
  I actually love this song. 
  - Not anymore. 
  - Mm. 
  pass you by - Mnh! 
  - Certainly distracting. 
  the memories Flare throw! 
  That's it? 
  Aaah! 
  [BOTH GASP] 
  Oh! 
  Damn! 
  [GROANS] 
  Oh! 
  [SHOUTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE] 
  Now. 
  [STUN GUNS CLICKING] 
  Time to go. 
  You don't have to do this. 
  Yeah, but we doing it. 
  Come on. 
  [BRAKES SQUEAL] 
  Yong, what are you doing? 
  No more running. 
  I'm tired of being a pawn. 
  They tell me I was saving lives, but I was really building a weapon. 
  You tell me you're a student, but you're really a spy. 
  - Nothing's real. 
  - I am. 
  You know that. 
  No, I don't. 
  I go with you, and what happens? 
  You lock me up? 
  - FRANKIE: Yong! 
  - WILL: Whoa, Yong. 
  Unh-unh. 
  This is not the right choice, my friend. 
  Put the gun down. 
  These men want to use you. 
  We don't. 
  Yong, listen to me. 
  Hey. 
  Look at me. 
  Standish believes in you. 
  He came here to save you. 
  No one can save me but me. 
  [ENGINE STARTS] 
  Safe now, man. 
  You can get up. 
  [GROANS] 
  You didn't tell me it was going to hurt. 
  Well, it hurts a lot less than the actual thing. 
  - sYou faked it? 
  - Well, yeah. 
  They were never gonna leave him alone unless they thought he was dead. 
  Why didn't you tell us your plan?! 
  Well, it had to seem real. 
  Plus, you two aren't the best actors. 
  Using our words against us. 
  He gets that from you. 
  [LAUGHING] 
  [BOTH GASP] 
  Guys? 
  - Shhhh! 
  - W-What's up, Will? 
  The mission's over. 
  You need to stop spying on this professor and his student. 
  - Come on. 
  Let's turn it off. 
  - That is never gonna happen. 
  He's about to get the results of his paternity test. 
  He seems devastated. 
  I think he already knows. 
  Suze. 
  Come on. 
  Will's right. 
  We We should stop. 
  - No. 
  - Yeah, no. 
  It's - I don't think I can. 
  - Yeah, no, it's it's - I - Yeah. 
  Thank you. 
  - You did the right thing. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  I guess we should go get some drinks? 
  Are you high? 
  Turn it back on! 
  - I'm so happy. 
  - I know. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  So, Yong is settling in at his new, safe university, and he will finish his degree under a new identity. 
  Unfortunately, no one can know where he is. 
  But since we're spies Yeah, I'm gonna see him next weekend. 
  Hey, Standish, you did a great job. 
  My man running point on a mission. 
  Very sexy. 
  That being said, if you ever call me again while I'm working just to show me off, I will shoot you. 
  I think she would. 
  Hey, guys, look, I got to, um tell you "Thank you" for everything you did. 
  You've taught me a lot of things in very, very different ways, but I wouldn't be the agent I am today if it wasn't for y'all. 
  Don't No, don't put that on us. 
  Yeah. 
  I don't want the credit for your lame-ass work. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Love you guys, too. 
  It's not a big deal. 
  Don't get sappy. 
  [VOICE BREAKING] 
  We trained him well. 
  It's like you don't listen. 
  [JAI AND SUSAN LAUGHING] 
  Hey. 
  I didn't think you guys would actually stop watching. 
  Mm. 
  We didn't. 
  It ended. 
  Yeah. 
  The baby was the professor's. 
  The vasectomy didn't take, and he's marrying her. 
  But get this he's not divorcing the wife, and neither of them know. 
  - What?! 
  - I think it's gonna work out. 
  Sounds exciting. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  You need help, there, Ray? 
  No. 
  Unh-unh. 
  I'm good. 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  Um, w-whatcha got? 
  It's the kid's first time running point. 
  It's kind of a big deal. 
  Yeah, it is. 
  Oh, stop. 
  So, I figured we could maybe put this up on the wall. 
  You know, commemorate it. 
  Check it out. 
  Oh, hey. 
  - Hey! 
  That's great! 
  - SUSAN: Ohh! 
  - It's actually not that bad. 
  - Wow. 
  Hey, guys, to college. 
  TOGETHER: To college. 
  Cheers. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Okay, tell me I couldn't be a grad student. 
  TOGETHER: You couldn't be a grad student. 
  - Not at all. 
  - No. 
  No.
