 So we've assembled all of America's best intelligence assets under one banner. 
 We are all officially working together. 
 As a team.

 That I'm a better person and a better agent because of it.

 Susan does love the "party girl from Barcelona" shtick. 
 I promised after we broke in and seized the nerve gas, I'd go dancing with her. 
 Oh, that sounds fun. 
 I'll come, too. 
 Invite-only. 
 Standish, we're in. 
 Okay, guys, it's a temperature-controlled room in the rear of the art gallery. 
 Pretty sure that's where somebody would keep nerve gas. 
 Now, I also want to go on record as saying we should have "Frankie'd" this guy... 
 Broke a few fingers, got him to talk. 
 Will you stop using my name as a verb? 
 It's a compliment. 
 Miguel Costa's a high-ranking Diplomat. 
 He's protected. 
 No agencies will touch him without evidence. 
 We... 
 secure the nerve gas, and then we get... 
 God! 
 You know, it's one thing to be a slob at home, Edgar... 
 Don't call me Edgar, man. 
 Ooh! 
 Then I'm just gonna use your given name every time I'm annoyed at you... 
 Edgar. 
 We're guests in this space, so... 
 Oh, my bad. 
 Did you want some of this? 
 Nah, it's cool. 
 The mayo's not even warm yet. 
 He's cool with it. 
 Ohh. 
 I do love Paris. 
 Really? 
 I would have thought it brings back all kinds of painful memories. 
 I mean, this is where you and Gigi... 
 you know. 
 No, Gigi did me a solid. 
 She forced me to realize that my true soul mate is still out there. 
 You never give up, do you? 
 On true love? 
 No. 
 Never. 
 [SIGHS DEEPLY] 
 Okay, guys, deploy the laser detection gas. 
 You mean the smoke bomb?

 Okay, so, bad news is we couldn't get the blood out of the Rembrandt. 
 The good news is that I already got the agency forgery department to paint a new one. 
 We have a forgery department? 
 You know the "Mona Lisa"? 
 Not the "Mona Lisa." Mnh-mnh. 
 This guy named Kevin painted it. 
 That's great, Ray. 
 Why are we here? 
 Huh? 
 We already took down Costa, and we seized the nerve gas. 
 Not 
 all of it. He admitted to selling a large quantity to a single buyer... Enough to take down an entire city. His name is Andrei Zimbrean, an exiled Romanian general hellbent on seizing control of the country. And he's gonna use the nerve gas to do it. So, capture Zimbrean... alive... To be tried for war crimes. He's coming out of hiding for the wedding of his only daughter this weekend in the South of France.

I'm sorry, but we need you to stay here for this one. Oh. Oh. [LAUGHING] Okay. Oh, yeah. No, no. I get it. I get it. That's cool. I'm cool. [LAUGHS] You know what, you guys? Have the best time.
