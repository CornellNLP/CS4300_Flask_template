 Previously on Powers... 
 We have three dead Powers taking the same drug. 
 Sway is Wolfe. 
 That's an unregulated Power's enhancer. 
 Wolfe broke out of his restraints. 
 If you find Wolfe, inflict as much damage as quickly as possible. 
 We need to overwhelm his healing power. 
 You seal him in and you wait for the rest of us. 
 Golden's down. Golden's down. 
 We will drive him back into his cell where the Drainer will be set up. 
 He takes away their powers. 
 The green light goes on, the powers go off. 
 No! 
 No more of my friends die. 
 Why aren't we keeping him fully restrained, sir? 
 I want to see what he does. 
 I want to know what he wants. 
 Did you invent it just for me? 
 No, you're more ambitious than that. 
 Not satisfied being the smartest boy in the room anymore, are you, Harley? 
 Decided to bring us all down to the same level. 
 You're not on my level. 
 No one is. 
 We're below you, is that it? 
 What does it feel like? 
 Like the invention of someone who's afraid of something. 
 What are you afraid of? 
 And why are you tippling during work hours? 
 What did you just feel? 
 You should fix that. 
 What did you feel? 
 I felt hunger. 
 No one goes in without me. 
 Should I call you when his legal team arrives? 
 They can talk to him through the intercom. 
 I have a thing. 
 Are you ready? 
 Are you sure you want to go? 
 They haven't announced anything yet. 
 And you're not expected. 
 I have to go. It's part of the job. 
 Hey! 
 You little sh1ts! 
 Are you hurt? 
 Come on! Come on! 
 You think it'd be better if you were dead instead of her? 
 What would that fix, Kutter? 
 There's no shame in being alive. 
 f*ck do you know? You weren't there. 
 Hey. 
 He wasn't there because he broke his arm trying to help Stockley. 
 Sure, whatever. 
 It's too bad Adlard didn't make it. 
 Yeah, may he rest in peace. 
 Cheers. 
 I'm right here, guys. Still not dead. 
 I can still hear his voice. 
 We love you, brother. 
 At least the department sprang for the booze this time. 
 Only takes four dead cops to get free booze. 
 There's no justice in them being dead. 
 And the Drainer's gonna change things. 
 f*ck the Drainer. 
 There's two of them in the whole world. 
 Ours doesn't even work yet and Wolfe's in the other, kicking back, talking to his lawyers. 
 Now what we should be doing, we should be cutting off his skin. 
 And right before he dies, we turn the Drainer off just long enough for him to heal. 
 And then we turn it on, set him on fire, then let people piss out the flames. 
 Show that sh1t on TV. 
 How about it, Walker? 
 You enjoy seeing that? 
 I'd bring the popcorn. 
 f*ck yeah. 
 f*ck yeah. 
 Let's get a drink. 
 Or we could offer our condolences first. 
 Mmm, absolutely. 
 The names you asked for. 
 Everyone got the Sway from one of me. 
 Except Olympia. 
 And Walker? 
 Oh, we both know where he probably got it. 
 Calista gave what she had to Olympia. 
 You're sure? 
 Every time there's a problem, it leads back to her. 
 She's not the problem. 
 Does she know you follow her? 
 No. 
 I don't want the police to get their hands on her again. 
 They won't. 
 Do you know the story of the Nemean lion? 
 From the Labors of Hercules. 
 For his first task, Hercules was sent to kill an invulnerable lion, and return with its hide. 
 He realized the only way to kill the lion was to strangle it with his bare hands. 
 Sway is doing something I don't understand. 
 I'll need help from one of you to figure it out. 
 I'll do it. 
 I can handle it. 
 It won't be pleasant. 
 We've lost so many. 
 And we will lose more. 
 But our... our hearts... 
 We must not surrender our hearts to anger or hatred. 
 Be compassionate. 
 Work for peace in your heart and the world. 
 Work for peace and never give up, no matter what's happening, no matter what's going on around you, I say again, never give up! 
 And fear nothing. 
 Golden, Chaykin, Argento, Mack. 
 Cheers. 
 So what happened with Hercules and the lion? 
 Even after Hercules killed the lion, he still couldn't take its hide. 
 Because it was impenetrable. 
 Precisely. 
 But I thought the point of Sway was to give us something that no one could ever take away. 
 Powers Complete. 
 A family bound by strength. 
 No one can hurt us. 
 Look at all the places we've been. 
 All the lives we've touched. 
 We have to know if Sway can be removed. 
 So, in the end, how did Hercules take the lion's hide? 
 With the beast's own claws. 
 I'll have to teleport the Sway from your body. 
 Cut it out from your DNA. 
 I'm ready. 
 Hey, one of those for me? 
 Okay, uh... I f*cked up. 
 I... I shouldn't have done what I did. 
 Hmm, are you talking about locking me in a cell or taking Sway? 
 Shh. 
 I had to try something. They were dying! 
 And taking some sh1t that could've killed you was the solution? 
 When I walked out of that cell... 
 I had to try! 
 I thought you were dead. 
 Sorry to disappoint you. 
 Don't make this into a joke. 
 What? I'm stepping on your lines? 
 The only reason you're here is because Zora showed up, and you wanna make jokes about... 
 Oh, Zora! Yeah, she's the real deal. 
 I'm a lucky guy! Yeah. 
 Yeah. You are. 
 Yeah. 
 Calista's still out there. 
 Royalle is still planning whatever the f*ck he's planning. 
 We have work to do. 
 I mean, that's four of our own, dead, because of Royalle. 
 And I need to know we're on the same page. 
 Four of our own? 
 You barely knew 'em. 
 Ugh. 
 Well, your Dad's a hit. 
 Oh, f*ck you. f*ck you. 
 DEA tipped us off. 
 Mule house in Tinder Banks is moving five million in base a month. 
 We get there, no spotters, no guards, nothing. 
 Go in the house. Jackpot. 
 But it's not five million, it's ten, easy. 
 Then, all of a sudden, one of the walls blows in. 
 Tinder Banks Outlaws, half the crew, blasting away at us. 
 And they got a Power. 
 f*ckin' Sorcerer Slim. 
 You went a couple of rounds with Sorcerer Slim back when. 
 Am I right, big guy? 
 He was over the hill by the time I was around. 
 Yeah, well, this was in his prime. 
 Mother fucker is shooting plasma blasts out of his fists. 
 And he's bulletproof. 
 Oh, yeah. We're f*cking dead. 
 Then swoosh! A streak of white and gold swoops down and Slim shoots up in the sky with it. 
 Five second later... 
 Boom! He hits the ground. 
 Screaming. Then, three Outlaws disappear, fall... Boom, boom, boom! 
 More screaming. 
 Holy sh1t! 
 Until they're all on the ground flopping around like carp. 
 Then, Olympia swoops down. 
 "Sorry I'm late, fellas. I had to get checked for the clap." 
 That's awesome. 
 Everybody went out and got Olympia tattoos after that. 
 I always say, let cops do cop sh1t. 
 But it's always good to have a Power come in and deal with Powers bullshit. 
 Olympia was a pimp. 
 You want to know what Olympia really thought about cops? 
 He thought that every cop on the LAPD was his personal bag man. 
 There to clean up his "indiscretions." 
 Harley, can I talk to you for a second? 
 I'm dry. 
 We can fix that. 
 Hey! I ever tell you guys about Three Titty Tony? 
 Now this guy! 
 You little sh1ts! 
 Here it comes. 
 Such bullshit. 
 Did you even see what she did? 
 Yeah, we weren't hurting anyone. 
 And she f*cking jumps, and... 
 She wasn't hurting anyone either. 
 And you were tagging a police station. 
 Yeah, well, you were filming it. 
 Dude, you totally ran from a Power. 
 Yeah? 
 Who's running now, huh? 
 Stop! Ah! 
 Payback! 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop! 
 Stop, stop, stop, stop! 
 Sorry. 
 What's up? 
 Um... 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I gotta go. 
 What? Why? 
 Sorry, I just... I promised him I'd always answer. 
 Royalle? 
 He's a creep! 
 You don't know! You don't know anything about him! 
 Yeah, well, I know him and his Powers mean more to you than I do. 
 So go. 
 You know, for a minute there, I thought that we were... 
 So, when's it gonna be working? 
 As soon as I figure out what's wrong with it. 
 So far I've only been able to get the prototype pod and the unit in Wolfe's cell to work. 
 But that one works, right? 
 Harley? The one in Wolfe's cell does work? 
 Nothing's permanent. 
 You, of all people, know that. 
 We talking Drainers or sobriety? 
 f*ck you! You mind? 
 So, as long as Wolfe stays under the Drainer, he's powerless. 
 As long as there's not a power surge or a black out or a system hack... 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 No pressure, Harley. Just anticipate every possible problem. 
 And what if there is a problem? 
 I fix it. That's my power, Walker. 
 I adapt. 
 Jesus. 
 You're welcome. 
 You're an asshole. 
 Well, here's to the eternal brotherhood of assholes. 
 That's what we should've called our cartoon. 
 Powers United. 
 sh1t, I mean, that's Janice all the way. 
 Classic Janice. 
 You had an idea. Remind me. 
 What was your idea? 
 Powers Up. 
 Oh, so it really could've been worse. 
 Yeah. 
 So, look... 
 When someone's in the light, what happens to their power? 
 I told you. The green light goes on. 
 And then... 
 The power goes off. 
 But you also said that if Wolfe leaves the Drainer, his powers come back. 
 Where do they go? 
 You want the address? 
 I'm sorry, but, I don't know how to get your powers back. 
 This isn't a wormhole into Powers Land. 
 Power can't just disappear, Harley. 
 So, where the f*ck does it go? 
 I know you figured something out. 
 I could give you a whole list of scientific explanations and, but... 
 What? I'm not smart enough to understand? 
 I'm just saying. 
 f*ck you. 
 Mrs. Chaykin... 
 Thank you so much for coming. 
 This means so much to all of us. 
 Oh, it's my honor. 
 And I'm so deeply, deeply sad for your loss. 
 Thank you, dear. 
 Yes. Yes. I appreciate it. 
 You okay? 
 Buy me a drink? 
 You know, in the stories how they say all's well that ends well, right? 
 So, you've got Boom! Boom! Boom! 
 f*ckin' Sorcerer Slim and company falling out of the sky. 
 So my partner asks, "What's going on?" 
 "Uh, it's raining assholes." 
 Never thought a Power could get VD. 
 Detective, grab a drink, join the party. 
 Your dad's hilarious. 
 You guys mind if I borrow him for a minute? 
 Go ahead. 
 Hmm. 
 Uh, remind me to tell you guys about the time Queen Noir hit on me when I... 
 I can't believe f*cking Adlard is still alive. 
 What? 
 Okay, I know it's hard for you, but could you maybe not make yourself the center of attention right now? 
 You think I'm sitting in this dump drinking this sh1t whiskey because I need attention? 
 Hmm, yeah. 
 I tell these stories because these cops need to hear them. 
 Bullshit. 
 They remind us who we are. 
 Why we all took an oath and put our asses on the line to do this job. 
 I don't know what they taught you over in sheriff's, but the LAPD has a long history that most cops are proud to be a part of. 
 Especially, at a time like this. 
 I'm sorry if you can't see that. 
 Hey, Waldo! 
 We wanna hear about the Queen. 
 You got it, Davie! 
 You're always welcome to join us. 
 So, so, she says to me, she says, "Waldo," she says, "Oh, I've heard things about you people... " 
 Is it real? 
 Yes. 
 Part of a dwindling supply. 
 Why are you giving it to me? 
 You want your powers, don't you? 
 Yeah, but Johnny said it's dangerous. 
 It might kill me. 
 Not if you're really a Power. 
 Good luck. 
 Wait, Simons, please... 
 I mean, does Johnny know? 
 That I've given you Sway? 
 No. I'd prefer to keep it that way. 
 I'll never tell him. I swear. You can trust me. 
 I trust that you care what Johnny thinks of you very much. 
 It's not that he doesn't believe that I'm really... 
 That's not why he doesn't want me to take it. 
 I know it's because he cares about me. 
 But I can't just sit around waiting for my powers if there's something I can try. 
 Right? 
 When Johnny conceived Sway, he needed a test subject. 
 He found me. 
 He said I might die. 
 But he promised I wouldn't die alone. 
 He said I would never be alone again. 
 It was risky. 
 And painful. 
 But he let me decide what I was, and was not, willing to do. 
 You should have the same options. 
 Well, drinks are free, so I got them covered. 
 Thank you. 
 That's the great equalizer, huh? 
 Yep, that's what he says. 
 Well, isn't that just so Harley. 
 Build a bomb, give it to the world and get drunk. 
 No, no, no, no, it's not a bomb, Janice. 
 We really need this. 
 It'll give the Powers a reason to stay in line. 
 It is a bomb, Christian. 
 And it doesn't discriminate. 
 It's only as good as the people who are dropping it. 
 That's us! That's Powers division. 
 Well, isn't that reassuring. 
 I got them back, Jan. 
 What? 
 At the Shaft, I had my powers again. 
 When I touched Wolfe, I could feel 'em, so I grabbed hold and it was like... it was like I was sucking my powers back out of him. 
 You got Wolfe, not Zora. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 When I picked him up, he felt like nothing. 
 I threw him through the floor. 
 And then, I tossed him into his cell. 
 But when he was under the Drainer, my power disappeared. 
 I felt myself being emptied out. 
 Yeah, all of it. f*ck! 
 It happened again! 
 I remember there was a moment where I went down and I remember it distinctly... 
 I felt him coming for me and I thought, that's it. 
 There's, there's, there's no one. 
 There's no one to stop him now. 
 But you were there, weren't you? 
 I... I don't know what happened, but I'm connected to him. 
 I got him back before, there must be a way to do it again. 
 Have you felt anything since that night? 
 No! And Wolfe is just sitting there, under that f*cking Drainer. 
 All that power... there has to be a way. 
 If that's what you miss and that's why you want your powers back, you haven't changed as much as I'd hoped. 
 No. No. If that's what I wanted, I could just tell everybody what happened. 
 Then why don't you? 
 We'd really love it if you could make an appearance. 
 Of course! Absolutely! 
 Don't make any promises. 
 The kids will be thrilled and it is a great cause. 
 It is, and we'll check Zora's schedule and we'll get back to you. Thanks. 
 Thanks. 
 We're gonna head over to the families now. 
 Okay. 
 And then you... 
 
 
 
 Oh, God, Candace! 
 Oh, Patty. Hi. 
 I can't believe they're really gone. 
 First Brian and now Sol. 
 You know we have to get together... 
 I'm so sorry for your loss. 
 Thank you. 
 We'll talk. 
 Oh, I am so sorry. 
 I know this is a hard time but it's really gonna be okay. 
 You just keep your head up. 
 Oh... Okay. Okay. 
 Sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 Uh, I don't wanna bother you, but would you, uh... 
 Oh! Of course! 
 Be right back. 
 Can't say no to a fan. 
 Hey. Hi. 
 We thought you'd wanna stay away from this one. 
 Yeah. Yeah, well... 
 You okay? 
 Believe me. I wouldn't be here if I had a choice. 
 She's a client? 
 The publicist who was handling her dropped the ball at the Shaft. 
 No, sh1t. And you were there to pick it up! 
 Campbell Academy doesn't pay for itself. 
 Art school won't either, you know? 
 Krispin needs me earning, not being fussy about how I get clients. 
 I'm sorry, I didn't mean your... 
 You're doing what needs to be done. 
 It's like having another teenager. 
 How is he? Krisp? 
 The Master of Secrets? I wish I knew. 
 He's trying to act normal, but it's not him. Not really. 
 Is beer with politicians acceptable? 
 You've got to be f*cking kidding me. 
 Let me get a picture. 
 Sure. 
 I gotta go do my job. 
 Sure. Go. 
 Here I'll do it for you. 
 Excuse me. 
 I promise. I'll bring her right back. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Everyone in here has the Where Are The Powers That Be app. 
 Pretty soon, all we're gonna be looking at are pics of "Zora partying at cop memorial." 
 That's not what I'm doing. 
 But that's how it's gonna look. 
 You told me you wanted to be an A-lister. 
 Model yourself after one. 
 You know what? I gave my condolences. 
 I'm out. 
 Oh, my God! You're doing something totally nonviolent, making a political statement, and this Power just decides you should be stopped? 
 And that's when people get hurt. 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, they were all okay, you know? 
 At least she stopped to help or whatever. 
 That's not the point! That was a major crash. 
 What if someone had been standing on the sidewalk? 
 That'd be f*cked up. 
 Or dead! 
 Just like your dad and my cousin. 
 And now, people can see that. 
 With your video and my skills, everyone is gonna be talking about us. 
 Yeah, you really think people are gonna watch a video of some kid tagging? 
 That is so not what this video is gonna be. 
 Who helped you film it anyway? 
 Uh, just a friend. 
 Thank you! There's more where that came from. 
 Look! She's so cool! She's helping that guy! 
 I wanna talk to you. 
 Another drink and I won't care. 
 Hey. 
 We've covered it already. 
 I f*cked up. I am a f*ck up. 
 Could you, for a moment, modulate your f*cking self-absorption. 
 I... Hey. 
 My dad, he loves telling that story. 
 I know. 
 He always leaves out the part about the half million in cash that went missing. 
 What? 
 Yeah, how do you think he bought the big mansion of his? 
 On his pension? 
 His strike team wasn't even supposed to be in that house. 
 He went in on some bullshit probable cause. 
 No real back up. 
 He knew the money was there. 
 Two of his men died. 
 Does he know you know? 
 Hell no. 
 Everyone's always telling me what a hero my dad is. 
 But real heroes? 
 They don't f*ck their partners, Walker. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Write a report? Tell Cross I took Sway? 
 f*ck Cross! You're supposed to tell me. 
 Not only did you take Sway and leave me with no back up, you locked me in a cell so I couldn't back you up either? 
 You turned me into a shitty partner. 
 I just... I didn't think it was fair to ask you to do that. 
 So you didn't ask at all? You just decided? 
 We're either working together or we're not. 
 Come on! Come on! Come on! 
 All right, here we go. And... up!

 Don't be afraid, little Retro Girl. 
 Come inside my parlor. 
 Christian! 
 Hey. 
 Detective Walker. 
 I still can't get used to that. 
 You need a hand or an arm? 
 An arm? Cute. 
 Funny man. 
 You know, when he lost his powers, I offered to make him his own armor. 
 You know what he said to me? 
 I don't want to end up like you. 
 You one-legged f*ck. 
 Okay, time to go. Come on. 
 The offer still stands, Christian. 
 We're gonna need all hands on deck. 
 Sure, get up. Let's go. 
 Get up. 
 Are you helping? 
 sh1t. I can't lift him. 
 Half his skeleton's f*cking titanium. 
 You have no idea what's coming. 
 Someday, Cross is gonna have to tell you. 
 What's coming? 
 Black Swan, it's coming. 
 It's coming soon. And the Drainer? 
 All it can do is slow the Black Swan down. 
 That doesn't matter. 
 He's coming. 
 Or she. 
 May be already here. 
 Harley. 
 Hey, Harley. 
 Are you serious about the Black... 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Who is the Black Swan? 
 What is that?

 Harley, enough now. I'm gonna take you home. 
 Oh. 
 Just like old times. 
 No, not quite. 
 What? 
 It was before your time, Christian. Come on, Harley. 
 Are you serious? 
 You and Harley had a... 
 For how long? 
 Hey, do you have any idea what he was talking about? 
 Whatever the Black Swan is, he certainly hasn't told me about it. 
 But then again the men in my life, and their secrets. 
 I could write a book, couldn't I? 
 I don't want to take credit for capturing Wolfe because I... 
 I don't want to be the guy who lost his powers again. 
 Then fight for them. 
 All right, help me to get him out of here. 
 You don't need my help. 
 I can carry the weight. 
 I need an extra set of hands for the balance. 
 Thanks. Thanks. 
 Phew! That was... Um... 
 When this thing winds down me and some of the brass are headed over to The Cozy. 
 It'd be good for you to get some face time. 
 Oh, you're so full of sh1t. 
 Excuse me? 
 That story you been telling all day? 
 I know. 
 I know. 
 I've done a lot of shitty things in my life, too, dad. 
 But at least I own up to them. 
 You done? 
 No. 
 I'll have my things out of the house by tonight. 
 Hey! 
 Could've used the door. My mom's not home. 
 Well, that's no fun. 
 Um, I thought maybe we could hang out. 
 Yeah, so did I. 
 I came back, all right? 
 If you're going to jump every time Johnny Royalle texts you to hook up then I don't exactly want to hang out. 
 You think I'm... 
 f*ck off. 
 What am I supposed to think? 
 Every time I come here, I'm taking a giant risk. 
 The police are looking for me and the only reason they haven't found me is because of Johnny. 
 I'm sorry, I... 
 Some Powers really are good, Krispin! 
 Johnny's the best friend I've ever had. 
 But you're too insecure and jealous to handle that. 
 Don't, don't! Look, I'm sorry. 
 I'm not jealous, you know, I just... 
 It sucked that you left. 
 There. 
 I hate this f*cking game. 
 You want to be alone? 
 No! 
 Never. 
 Help me. 
 He's okay. He's gonna be okay. 
 Take me home. 
 I want to go home. 
 Why did you do that to him? 
 I had to. 
 You tried to take the Sway out. 
 I would've been alone again. 
 I made the Sway from Wolfe's blood. 
 I know that. So f*cking what? 
 It let Walker take Wolfe's power. 
 It's changing people. 
 I don't know what else it might do. 
 And I can't take it back. 
 I love this part. 
 Can I tell you something? 
 Yeah. 
 I have to pee. 
 It's down the hall and to the left. 
 Be right back. 
 Go to showusyourpowers.com. 
 I got to call you back later. 
 Just get online. 
 I hacked the site. 
 What? 
 I made a Chaotic Chick rick roll. 
 People think those drivers from the car wreck actually died. 
 Wait, what do you mean? 
 The comments are amazing. 
 They're so anti-Powers. 
 But nobody died. 
 I just edited the end. 
 It's working, Krispin. 
 Our video has 30,000 plays already. 
 We're getting through to people. 
 sh1t. 
 Calista, wait. 
 Krispin? 
 Krispin, what's going on? 
 Emile. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm sorry, I, I, I didn't mean to, um... 
 What is it? 
 Can it wait? 
 Just this once can it f*cking wait? 
 What's going on? 
 Harley just said you don't know what's coming, and then he started going on about the Black Swan. 
 Is this about... 
 Harley has his own beliefs. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah? Like... like what? 
 They're different from mine. You'll have to ask him. 
 Emile, if you know something about the Drainer, uh, every cop in this division deserves to know. 
 What exactly do you want to know, Detective? 
 The future? 
 Get in line. 
 I want to know what's going on. 
 If there's some threat that we can be preparing... 
 Here's what I believe! 
 You can prepare your soul. 
 That's it. 
 No one can be ready for the rest of it. 
 Not even Harley's smart enough to do that. 
 Fucker doesn't deserve f*cking rights. 
 The judicial system is run by a bunch of dickless maggots. 
 Look at it. 
 Shh, take it... 
 Oh, f*ck you, dead man. 
 Get your geriatric hands off me. 
 Hey, hey, whoa, hey. 
 That's not funny anymore. 
 Oh, it's f*cking hilarious. 
 Where the f*ck were you down there, anyway? 
 Where the f*ck were you? 
 Just calm down. 
 Calm down. 
 Oh, sh1t. The convenient cripple speaks. 
 Your face should be on the wall with the rest of the dead people, old man. 
 Hey! It should be and you know it! 
 Hey, get off. 
 Stop! Knock it off! 
 Hey! Stop it! 
 It's him, man. 
 Here comes the big swinging dick. 
 What? 
 You really got off on being a Power, didn't you? 
 You know what I think? 
 I think we should lock up every Power on the planet and drain them. 
 The world would be better off without them. 
 Hey, if it wasn't for us, Wolfe would've killed everyone, you worthless f*ck. 
 Hey, guys. Might want to see this. 
 When I was caught in this Drainer, I panicked. 
 I had never felt so small. 
 So desperate. 
 Powerless. 
 And then, I had a moment of monstrous clarity. 
 I understood, in my powerlessness, I understood the true horror of everything I had done. 
 And I wished then... let this be the end. 
 Let me not live with this knowledge. 
 This horror. 
 But my attorneys inform me I cannot escape to that dark country. 
 There is no death penalty here. 
 Only when my powers are drained permanently, will the world be safe. 
 This is my deepest wish. 
 And I humbly ask the courts to grant it.
