 Previously on Powers... 
 So, if you're watching this, I'm probably dead. 
 Continue your work together. 
 All of my assets, including this house, and all my proprietary technology, are yours now. 
 Have some f*cking fun. 
 You got to get out of Powers Division. 
 You think I'm gonna leave my job here? 
 They're coming for you! 
 Your father is being picked up by the Bureau this morning. 
 Part of an ongoing investigation into city corruption. 
 If there's anything you can do to make this go away, I'm begging you to do it. 
 Senator Bailey Brown. 
 He's been making headlines recently, as he's the main player for the anti-Powers legislation. 
 When the use of superpowers becomes illegal for everyone, then and only then can we be safe. 
 Scandalous video of Senator Bailey Brown emerged this morning. 
 Now the fate of his bill is in question, and no one can seem to find him. 
 I know that you killed Janice, and I will not stop until everybody knows the truth. 
 She was such a fighter. 
 She fought right until the end. 
 f*ck! Walker! Walker! 
 FRANCE, THE BATTLE OF THE ARGONNE FOREST 14 OCTOBER, 1918 
 Keep your head down. 
 Victory... is right over there. 
 It's yours for the taking. 
 Take it from those murdering sons of German bitches. 
 That nest of vipers is all that stands between you and your loved ones. 
 You're the murdering son of a bitch. 
 Patrick, no. 
 Did you say something? 
 Did you? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Repeat it. 
 Stop. 
 Not these men... Not today. 
 You coward. 
 I'm going to have you shot. 
 I'll save you the trouble. 
 Suicide! No! 
 No, Patrick, no! 
 You... stop. 
 What's your name? 
 You can call me "death." 
 Has he finally showed up? 
 No. 
 Just dropping off more hate mail. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Hey, Daniel, not too far now, okay? 
 You ready for lunch? 
 Not yet. 
 Do you miss it? 
 What? 
 You know, all that crazy. 
 No, I don't miss it at all. 
 Not one bit. 
 Couldn't be happier. 
 Make sure your brother doesn't fall in the lake. 
 This is Cross. 
 RESERVATIONS CONFIRMATIONS FOR GUESTS CHOOSE YOUR PACKAGE BUY 
 f*ck! 
 You know, when people say they feel like a building fell on them... 
 That's not what this felt like. 
 But a building did fall on you. 
 And they said I was fine. 
 Yeah. 
 f*cking miracle. 
 This felt like my head was exploding, you know... three times now. 
 I have no idea why. 
 You should have been killed. 
 Sure, I know that. 
 You know, at least broken bones or suffered a traumatic brain injury... 
 Something. 
 But everything is normal. 
 It's not normal. 
 What? Oh, surviving that? 
 No, it's not normal... 
 No, my-my head. 
 Something's wrong. 
 I believe you, but I can't find anything. 
 What do you mean? 
 I mean, I can see nothing organic or problematic in any test that would point to a source for your symptoms. 
 I'm not making this up, Doc. 
 I... 
 No, I didn't say that. 
 But you have been through a pretty serious change of circumstance, personal loss, job loss. 
 Now, not to be glib about this, but have you considered PTSD? 
 You want a second opinion? 
 No, I want it to stop. 
 How about you give us a couple of days in the hospital under observation? 
 No, thank you. 
 Can I just get some painkillers? 
 All right. 
 Are you allergic to any particular medication? 
 Not that I know of, I... 
 Walker. 
 Didn't expect to see you here. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Goes both ways. 
 Nice. 
 Why are you here? 
 It's not every day a girl gets to see her father on trial for his life. 
 They don't execute you for corruption. 
 You'd be a cop in prison. 
 Point taken. 
 Yeah. 
 What happened in there? 
 Oh, trial's delayed. Prosecutor has some new evidence he needs to review so he can hang me higher, probably. 
 Listen... Stay away from this. 
 If you're going after another job, being seen with me is not gonna help your chances. 
 That's right. 
 But it doesn't matter. I'm... 
 I'm done with law enforcement. 
 Now, don't say that. You're a good cop. 
 Deena? 
 What happened? 
 Just had my eyes opened. 
 Politics and lies, that's all this job is, right? You know that. 
 Pumpkin. 
 Look, why don't we... have lunch? 
 You can tell me what's on your mind. 
 I got to take this. 
 I... rain check. 
 Yeah? 
 What... what now? 
 Senator Bailey Brown, also known as the Cobalt Knight, was found murdered in his Los Angeles office this morning, head crushed. 
 The pathologist on scene called TOD at roughly 24 hours ago. 
 That puts him dead early Thursday morning. 
 He's a senator, so where's the FBI? 
 Gone. 
 The FBI have Retro Girl's killer. 
 The accomplice is already dead, and the drainer is back in our possession. 
 What about Conrad Moody? 
 That's being treated as a suicide for now. 
 As far as I'm concerned, the little f*ck... Strictly off record, got what he deserved. 
 The senator was a Power. 
 His anti-Powers legislation made enemies. 
 The murder happened on our turf. 
 We are expected to do our job. 
 So, Walker, you and Pilgrim get over to the federal building. 
 It's ours? 
 Sure, until you f*ck it up. 
 So don't f*ck it up. 
 Miss you. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, fine. 
 Glad to be back. 
 Hi. 
 You're that PTB lady. 
 Nicole Glantz. How are you? 
 Nervous. 
 When you're around, sh1t happens. 
 Comes with the job. 
 What's your name? 
 Nope. 
 That's cool. 
 Don't blame you. 
 I'm wondering if you could identify someone for me. 
 Do you know what this is from? 
 Yeah, it's that senator's s*x tape. 
 Do you know who that is? 
 I'm told this place has the best cosplay gear in town, and that Retro Girl outfit is top of the line. 
 Did you sell it? 
 I'm not the only one that works here. 
 So give me their names. 
 If they know who this woman is, I'll give them the $500. 
 Yeah, she shops here. 
 Name and address. 
 I'll get it for you. 
 We'll be waiting. 
 It's Pelham. 
 He's breaking a story on Senator Brown. 
 That f*cking b*st*rd. 
 What'd I miss? 
 It's a stunning and horrifically tragic end to a once-great Power who devoted his life to the preservation of law and order. 
 Senator Bailey Brown, formerly the Cobalt Knight, was found murdered in his Los Angeles office early this morning. 
 PTB and I will continue to follow this story wherever it leads, bringing you every twist and turn, lifting any rock we find to expose those responsible. 
 Some psycho with an axe to grind had something to do with this gruesome end to a tarnished hero, and no one will keep me from bringing you the truth. 
 FRENCH BATTLEFIELD HOSPITAL 16 OCTOBER, 1918 
 Patrick? 
 How are you feeling? 
 Is there anything you need? 
 I don't know you. 
 Yes, I'm new. 
 I haven't been at this very long, and I get the impression that you're just starting. 
 I know. 
 Your head is buzzing. 
 You're probably scared. 
 My name is Janice. 
 And I'm not really a nurse. 
 You have the doctors mystified. 
 A lot of people don't understand how you did what you did. 
 It was wrong. 
 It was necessary. 
 You don't understand. 
 Yes, I do. 
 Who are you? 
 May I sit down? 
 Someone just like you. 
 I'm a freak. 
 You're a miracle... 
 One of many... 
 All of them capable of changing the world. 
 The world should end if all we do is slaughter each other. 
 We're here to make sure that doesn't happen. 
 People like you, like us... 
 People who can make a difference, who can stop this madness... 
 We can change things. 
 Nothing good can come from this, not ever. 
 You need to get away from me. 
 Patrick, I know what you're going through right now... 
 Not another word. You go, or I will make you go. 
 And you don't want that. 
 Until next time. 
 There won't be one. 
 There will. 
 I promise. 
 I don't think I can do this. 
 Hello? 
 You can. 
 Being a cop comes naturally to you. 
 Then naturally, I should be arresting your ass for murdering Conrad Moody. 
 Well, there's the law, and then there's... 
 ...what's right. 
 There's just... the law. 
 You believe in justice, Deena. 
 Sure, but not at the cost of my soul! 
 Hey, you're in the car, on your way to a crime scene with your partner. 
 We're gonna be fine. 
 Right? 
 Right. 
 For a genius, you had no sense of organization. 
 You use the alphabet. Use numbers, for Christ's sake. 
 Use something. 
 Apparently, he's using you. 
 Good morning. 
 Good morning. 
 You made coffee. 
 I did. 
 And you brought sunshine. 
 Aren't you working it? 
 How's our house guest? 
 Calista is still sleeping, and she hasn't slept in weeks. 
 Yeah, she's been through a lot. 
 She's gonna flip when she hears about Senator Brown. 
 Two-thirds of the original Unity now dead. 
 Well, I don't think SuperShock has anything to worry about. 
 And here I was thinking "New Unity" might be a good name for us. 
 What? 
 Be like calling ourselves "Tempting Fate." 
 Well, there's no rush, right? 
 We still have a lot to figure out here. 
 No, no, no. Not sure I agree with that. 
 There's a Power vacuum, Zora, and it's gonna be filled by whatever gets there first, bad sh1t included. 
 I think we need to let the public know that we're here and that we stand between them and chaos. 
 Wow, that's all great, but who's "we"? 
 You, me, and Calista? 
 Yeah, we're not ready for anything like that. 
 Triphammer thought we were. 
 No, Triphammer thought we had potential. 
 There's a difference. 
 So we need to maximize our potential. 
 Okay, now you're talking. How do we do that? 
 Not alone. 
 We need a commanding officer. 
 Okay. Let's dial the military down a bit. 
 Basically, a coach, someone with experience. 
 Experience at being a badass, Level 10 Power, interested in making us into a team. 
 Should I check Craigslist? 
 I'm being serious. 
 I'm serious, too. 
 No one's gonna want to touch vet in a can, an Internet joke, and a road show Retro Girl. 
 I heard that. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I didn't mean... 
 It's okay. 
 You are an Internet joke. 
 And I wasn't eavesdropping. I just have super hearing. 
 You hear about the senator? 
 Yeah. 
 So about this coach? 
 Think it's a good idea? 
 Yeah, I know someone that might help. 
 Blood spray has hard hits on the ceiling. 
 Vertical ejection of bone and brain matter. 
 He popped. 
 Like a grape. 
 Then back splash here and over there where whoever it is flung blood away. 
 Has Marrs seen this? 
 Dr. Marrs is out sick. I'm... I'm Wallace. 
 Covering for her until she gets back. 
 Is she okay? 
 Well, cracking Powers can take its toll. 
 Anyway, I'd say that the attack was fast. 
 Takes approximately 500 pounds of force to crush a man's skull. 
 So whoever did this wasn't fooling around. 
 Was he facing his killer? 
 Well, it's hard to say, but based on the evidence, I'd say yes. 
 Two glasses and a bottle. 
 Yep. 
 And the safe was open when you got here? 
 The staffer said it was, but you should check. 
 Yeah. 
 Can I... scrape him up now? 
 Two seconds. 
 The door was locked, but the window was open? 
 Again, staffer said yes, but... 
 You should... check. 
 We'll... we'll check, yes. 
 Scrape away. 
 Okay. 
 We're gonna need surveillance video for this guy. 
 And satellite imagery. 
 Yeah. 
 Who's your favorite? 
 Ignoring the sh1t ton of Powers hate mail against his legislation? 
 His bill died as soon as he fell from grace, so why murder him? 
 Well, you kill one anti-Powers leader, you threaten them all. 
 He could've done it any time. Why now? 
 s*x tape. 
 Okay. 
 So crime of passion. 
 He got a jealous girlfriend or boyfriend. 
 Someone mad that it got out and didn't want any more out there? 
 Okay, let's start there. 
 Interviewing 1,000 angry Powers. 
 Awesome. 
 It's good to be back. 
 Walker? 
 Yeah. 
 He's kind of an asshole. I know. 
 Yeah, but he was Diamond. 
 So he knows things. 
 What about your friend SuperShock? 
 I don't think so. He's not that sociable. 
 And... 
 Nothing. 
 He seems to like you. 
 Yeah, but no, seriously, he's cranky, and it's best not to bother him. 
 And Walker's not cranky? 
 Well, at least we know where to find him. 
 And he knows us. 
 And if he gets mad and stomps his foot or something, the whole ceiling's not gonna fall off. 
 Okay. 
 Great. 
 Let's talk to Walker. 
 That's something I think I should do alone. 
 If we all come at him... 
 Yeah. 
 What if Walker says no? 
 Plan B. 
 What's that? 
 Hell if I know. 
 
 
 
 USA BURBANK, CA., B-17 BOMBER FACTORY MARCH, 1945 
 Melissa, I need the Sperry rep on the phone. 
 Tell him it's about the reflector sights. 
 Melissa, are you there? 
 I think Melissa went to get a sandwich. 
 How did you get in here? 
 Security's gonna flip. 
 You look good, Patrick. 
 Doing your part, I see, making sure the bombs drop on time. 
 You need to go. 
 That's what you said last time. 
 How did you avoid the draft? Flat feet? 
 My skills made sense here. 
 Oh. Do a lot of heavy lifting then, do you? 
 I'm good with numbers. 
 Really? 
 What do you want? 
 Well... 
 I want you to take a number and add something to it. 
 Say eight million, the number of people in New York City, plus one atomic bomb. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Success and failure. 
 The failure of our boys out in the American southwest doing their best to create a weapon that could end this war tomorrow and make Germany and Japan surrender like that, if not for the fact that they can't figure it out. 
 They've tried and tried, but it's a no-go. 
 On the other hand, Hitler's boys made the cut. 
 What? 
 The Nazis figured out how to split the atom, Patrick. 
 They made a bomb that can destroy New York, London, or Paris in the blink of an eye, and it's only a matter of time and maybe days before the war ends and we're all under Axis thumbs helping them build rockets to goose step on the moon... 
 Those of us still alive, that is. 
 And that is why President Truman would like to discuss with you the possibility, however slight, of you getting off your ass and saving the world. 
 Mrs. Bailey. 
 So bad news. 
 Forensics says the only prints on the glasses were the senator's. 
 And video surveillance is a dead end, inside, outside, even satellite stuff. 
 Any good news? 
 The woman in the s*x video's name is Belinda Kowaleski. 
 She's a babysitter and a stripper. 
 Not kidding. 
 She looks better as a blonde. 
 Where is she now? 
 Underground, off the grid. 
 No credit cards used, no cash withdrawals, not at her last known address, and hasn't been since her debut with the senator. 
 You think she'd be pimping on a reality series by now. 
 Maybe she's scared. 
 sh1t. It's Nicole Glantz. 
 Do not answer that. 
 Hey, I'm a little busy. 
 I'm here with Belinda Kowaleski. 
 Okay. 
 I see from that reaction that means something. 
 Where are you? 
 Guarantees first. 
 Why? 
 Because she says her boyfriend killed the senator, and I want to be there when you take him down. 
 WASHINGTON, D.C. - 28 APRIL, 1945 TWO DAYS BEFORE THE DEATH OF HITLER 
 If your name is Patrick, get in the goddamn car. I don't have all day. 
 Yes, I'm the President. 
 If you're gonna sh1t yourself, do it outside the car. 
 Need to get this back to my secretary in 30 minutes, and I don't want a hitch in this goddamn giddy-up. 
 You gonna breathe sometime soon? 
 Yes. Hello, sir. 
 Right, sorry about the cloak-and-dagger. I normally do this in the office, but we're working outside protocol here. 
 Janice tells me you're the man for the job. 
 Will you do it? 
 Do what, sir? 
 Save the free world. 
 I'd have her handle it. Lord knows she's built for action... 
 But she's got her hands full with Tojo and all that happy-crappy. 
 What is it that you have in mind? 
 What is it I have... 
 Like I'm ordering a drink in the club car. 
 What I have in mind, if you are the man for the job, is the death of Hitler, the securing of their Nazi A-bombs, and a swift conclusion to this worldwide horseshit. 
 You want me to kill Adolf Hitler? 
 f*ck that fucker up, yes, sir. 
 And any other toads you get your hands on. 
 Himmler and Goering would be nice. 
 The eggheads have him in a bunker under the chancellery. 
 The closer the Russians get, the sooner he's liable to use his bombs. 
 We done talking yet? 
 I want something from you. 
 I wasn't expecting a horse trade. 
 If I get you Hitler's bombs... 
 After killing that screamy little fucker and anyone else you can get your hands on. 
 Yes. 
 You must promise me you'll destroy them. 
 Destroy... 
 That... 
 That's a tough ask, young man. 
 I could just throw them into the sun. 
 Don't. 
 I have got people desperate to get to the bottom of this atomic thing, and we need to get there, if only to stay ahead of our next batch of enemies. 
 What next batch? 
 Son, they grow like mushrooms in the dark. 
 They're coming, trust me, and with bigger bombs. 
 Fine. 
 You figure them out and then destroy them and never make another one. 
 Son... 
 They can't be used. 
 Not ever, especially not by us. 
 Hitler dead. 
 I destroy the bombs. They never get used. 
 Not ever. 
 You have my word. 
 A grateful nation thanks you, or they will. 
 Well, actually they won't. 
 This has got to be just between you and me. 
 Good, I see you found the place okay. 
 Please. I stalk you, don't you know? 
 Where's your meal ticket? 
 Can we be nice? 
 I might have just solved this case for you, and I could use the acknowledgement. 
 You need a pat on the head? 
 Hey, come on, come on. 
 I want to keep my job. 
 Pelham and I are in a bit of a thing. 
 He wants you out, or... 
 He feels threatened. f*ck him. 
 At least that's one thing we agree on. 
 Hey, common ground. 
 There you go. 
 Just to be clear, you're cool with my demands, right? 
 Yeah. Where's Belinda Kowaleski? 
 Right here. 
 I have a few demands myself. 
 Like what? 
 That he won't come kill me after he rips out your throats trying to arrest him. 
 I love this job. 
 His name is Teddy Morosco. 
 When he's stressed, he gets super hairy, pointy ears, and his teeth get big. 
 And he's quick. 
 You'll need to nuke him, or you're dead, and I'm dead. 
 You're salivating, Nicole. 
 He good at climbing walls? 
 Hell, yeah. 
 He kept showing up in my room. 
 I'm in a sixth floor single at Park La Brea. 
 At least, I was until the tape sh1t happened. 
 He'd come in through the window and practically hump my leg every night. 
 Okay. 
 Belinda... how did you meet the senator? 
 Answered an ad. 
 "Perv with camera seeks Powers cosplay for sexy snaps." 
 s*x was never supposed to be involved. 
 The guy got pushy, and he had cash, and I thought, "What the hell?" 
 I didn't know he was a senator until the tape came out. 
 But, then you disappeared. 
 Had to. 
 Nicole found me through a neighbor who was getting my mail. 
 That's how I got this. 
 That's Teddy's confession before the fact, pretty much. 
 He said he'd win me back by defending my honor. 
 By killing the senator. 
 Said he was gonna bite the b*st*rd's head off. 
 Did he? 
 Well, we're gonna find out. 
 You have an address for Teddy? 
 He's crashing at this creepy, old... 
 We're good? We have an understanding, right? 
 BERLIN 30 APRIL, 1945 7 AUGUST, 1945 
 Mein Fuhrer, the car is waiting. 
 We need to leave now to make it to the plane. 
 Yes, yes! Get the dog! Don't forget the dog! 
 Mein Fuhrer? 
 Wish I didn't have to interrupt. 
 But we all have things to do... and places to go... 
 You made the atomic bombs! 
 Didn't you? 
 Didn't you? 
 Tell me where to find them! 
 On a plane! On a plane to Moscow! 
 You're too late. 
 You murdering son of a bitch. 
 Mein Fuhrer. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Mein Fuhrer! 
 Your turn. 
 Good bye. 
 Who is it? 
 It's your father. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 What's the matter? 
 Nothing's the matter. I just stopped by to see you. 
 Really? 
 'Cause I just got here. 
 Were you out there waiting for me? 
 Can I come in? 
 Yeah. 
 And? 
 So you're back on the firing line. 
 Yes. Yes! 
 I am gainfully employed. 
 Working with Walker. 
 What did your lawyer have to say? 
 We're back on tomorrow. 
 I guess the prosecutor got his ducks together. 
 Don't be there. 
 I can't anyway. 
 I'm picking up a suspect in an hour. 
 Tomorrow's gonna be hard. 
 Yeah. For both of us. 
 Is there anything you need to tell me? 
 What? 
 Look, I am your father. 
 It's in my job description to listen and help you out if... 
 Help with what? 
 I don't know, you tell me. 
 Nothing to tell. 
 Look, Deena, I'm not here to lecture you or demand the truth of whatever the hell went down... 
 Went down with what? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm just here if you want to talk. 
 Thank you. I don't. 
 The next time we talk may include a pane of glass and two telephones. 
 So if there is anything... 
 Dad, I got to go. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I... I understand. 
 Go do your job. 
 Be careful. 
 Thank you. 
 I love you. 
 Okay, guys, keep it simple in there. 
 This is a high-risk warrant, so stay focused, don't get bunched up. 
 Are those both rolling? 
 Yes. 
 If sh1t goes south in there, you give them to me, okay? 
 That wasn't the deal. 
 Or you could give them to him now, stay in the van. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, good. 
 Let's go. Good luck. 
 Police! 
 Right here, on your right! 
 There he goes! 
 Coming your way! 
 Go, go! 
 Hey! 
 He's down! 
 Subject's down! 
 Secured. 
 Not a match. 
 If he bit the senator's head off, it was with a spitless mouth. 
 No saliva. 
 No matching DNA at all. 
 No hair, no claw marks on the exterior of the... 
 Okay, enough. Thank you. We get it. 
 He alibi out? 
 On the night in question, he was at a bar in Bakersfield playing in a band from 9:00 p.m. till 4:00 in the morning. 
 So, not your dog. 
 No, only thing he's guilty of is writing a stupid letter to his ex-girlfriend. 
 Speaking of letters, we should get to that hate mail. 
 Give me a minute. I got a thing. 
 Where you going? 
 Her dad's trial, I would think. 
 That's today? 
 It's been all week. 
 sh1t, right. 
 But you've got a lot on your mind, I guess. 
 Yeah. 
 Mother f... 
 Holy sh1t, are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, terrific. 
 What's up? 
 Maybe now's not a good time. 
 Yeah, well, haven't you noticed? 
 Times are shitty all over. 
 Come, walk and talk. 
 Okay, so Tiberio, Zora, and I were thinking that... 
 And who's... who's Tiberio? 
 That's Triphammer's new recruit. 
 Oh, yeah. Martinez. 
 Yes. 
 You should go see a doctor. 
 I did. 
 He says it's just a headache. 
 I'm good. What can I do for you? 
 Well, we want to team up, but we need help. 
 Help? 
 Guidance. 
 What kind of guidance? 
 We want you to be our Powers coach. 
 Seriously? 
 Come on, you've been there. 
 Triphammer's gone, and who trained you? 
 You didn't become Diamond overnight. 
 Somebody guided you, like Janice or... 
 It wasn't Janice. 
 Who was it? 
 Patrick. 
 SuperShock. 
 You're kidding me. 
 No. 
 You should ask him. He'd probably get a kick out of it. 
 I'm asking you. 
 Look, I appreciate it, and really, it would be an honor. 
 But... 
 I'm not the right guy. 
 You could be. 
 I... 
 I'm not, okay? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Walker. 
 God bless you. 
 See you later. 
 You betcha. 
 What the f*ck was that? 
 That was the threat of exposure. 
 Certain people further up the food chain weren't comfortable with the idea of me being questioned, and that ends that. 
 Like I said, the past is a bitch. 
 Yeah. 
 So is the present. 
 Doesn't have to be. 
 So how do you do it? 
 Do what? 
 Get through every day, everyone thinking you're a great cop, but you know in your heart you're sh1t. 
 No, Deena... 
 No, no, no, Dad. 
 I really... 
 I need to know. 
 You make allowances. 
 Allowances? 
 Yeah. 
 What? Like, you let things slide even though you know you shouldn't, and that somehow makes things better? 
 Yes. 
 The world needs this, so you do that. 
 Keep it simple. 
 But you broke the law. 
 You and your mother deserved the best life I could give you.
