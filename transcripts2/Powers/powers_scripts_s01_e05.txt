 Previously on Powers... 
 Wolfe broke out of his restraints. 
 You came back for me. 
 I thought you forgot me. 
 I poked him in his f*cking brain too many times. it made his power work harder. I've f*cked it up. 
 Where's Calista? 
 Hey. 
 Are you gonna give me your number or what? 
 He just ate six people. 
 We can contain him. 
 I called it "the Drainer". It takes away their powers. 
 Sway is Wolfe. 
 I thought it would allow people with limited powers to reach their full potential. 
 You don't think I can do it? 
 Wolfe has taken down Powers with years of experience in action. 
 You work for me. 
 Not the other way around. 
 If your partner's still alive... it's only because Wolfe wants him to be. 
 There's power here. 
 Get out of my way. 
 River was real. 
 He always stood for the truth. 
 Jesus sh1t, Johnny. 
 Wanna see something rad? 
 Look over there. 
 He already gone, dude. 
 You're gonna get f*cking caught one day. 
 My timing is perfect. Half a second before or after and the bartender and I would have been on intimate terms. 
 Yo, she just checked me out, right? 
 You should go for it. 
 Take a bottle over there, and pour her a drink. 
 How smooth is that? 
 Or, you could go over there make your move and, she shoots you down cold. 
 In front of everyone. 
 Shut the f*ck up. 
 Do you remember me, teacher? 
 You weren't lost. 
 You were a cocky little sh1t. 
 Come on. 
 Dude, he's waiting! 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you, Johnny. 
 Ah? 
 Glasses would be nice. 
 Oh no, that's my bad. 
 I'm on it. 
 Let him make up for his own mistakes Christian. 
 You'll not always be there to cover for him. 
 I don't cover for him. 
 sh1t! 
 It's all good, man. 
 Sorry. 
 I got it. 
 We didn't know. 
 Me, Johnny, all of us. We didn't know. 
 Who we were. 
 What we could be. 
 You showed us. 
 When I first came to America, after the war, but I camped one night with a true f*cking, gentleman tramp. 
 A proper Baribee. 
 I've got my hands on a bottle of Dago Red. 
 But when I offered him a swig, he demurred. 
 He said, "my boy, my boy, you must always endeavor to be civilized. After all, we're not animals, are we?" 
 This said, he plucked two crystal tumblers from his knapsack rubbed his kerchief over them, and gave us both a drink. 
 And from that day to this, I have not drunk from the neck of a bottle. 
 Be true unto yourself. 
 Be powerful No... this... this isn't you. 
 This is not who you are! 
 To that old Baribee and his civilizing influence. 
 Prost! 
 Yes. 
 I remember you, Christian. 
 You and your disappointing love of shiny things. 
 Look at her. 
 All wrapped up like a Christmas present. 
 She's smart. 
 She's branding herself. Reinforcing her message. 
 And what is her message? 
 Buy more Retro Girl merchandise. 
 Her message is-is "I'm here." 
 I mean, she's so f*cking good at it. 
 She is so good at being a hero. 
 You wanted to be a hero. 
 You refuse to believe that there are no heroes. 
 Heroic acts in the pursuit of glory have no virtue. 
 You refuse to believe that there are no heroes. 
 And then you prove me right. 
 You... 
 The true secrets of achieving your full potential is knowing how little time you have. 
 Here and gone. 
 All right. Well, while you two philosophers figure out the world, I'm gonna go see what I'm capable of. 
 Cheers. 
 What has become of you, Christian? 
 I became a cop. 
 Too late for this. 
 You had your chance. 
 You put me in here. 
 What has happened to you? 
 No, why... why... why... why do you smell like me? 
 Breaking news from the Federal Powers Containment Facility in Los Angeles: The vicious Power known as Wolfe, has escaped his cell. 
 We've been informed by the Federal Powers Bureau, and the local Powers Law Enforcement that the notorious mass-murderer, Wolfe, has escaped. 
 Shake down in The Shaft, people are asking, how could the man-eater have broken loose? 
 Is this real, is this... confirmed? 
 Wolfe's 2000 escape resulted in the massacre of hundreds at the Sky Terrace Amphitheater. 
 Only after fans favorite Powers United crashed in was the day saved. 
 But that was the end for the flashy super team. 
 Who doesn't feel like an outsider sometimes? I mean... who doesn't feel like an outsider most of the time? 
 The years I was alone, were lonely. I didn't know who I was, I didn't know how I felt. 
 Because you were a Power? 
 Because I was me, because I was different. 
 Because there was no one else like me. 
 And that is a lonely feeling. 
 And we can all feel it. 
 And the world keeps telling us that we shouldn't feel different. 
 But if we do feel different... 
 We should stay apart. 
 Because we won't be accepted. 
 And we may not be. 
 And we may never be accepted. But that is not my problem. 
 That's someone else's problem. 
 My problem... 
 ... climbing out of windows sucks The only problem I have in life is Aw! 
 sh1t. 
 sh1t. 
 Where's your mom? 
 ... who I am... 
 Working. 
 ... and how I want to live my life. 
 I could be with people, and not have it cost me anything. 
 So you're actually terrible at sneaking through windows. 
 f*ck you. I'm awesome. 
 Is that how you chose your name? 
 Wolfe? 
 Because, being alone, being a loner, made you feel like an animal? 
 They should have killed him back when they first caught him. 
 I chose my name when I was a kid. 
 Because it made me feel cool. 
 He's a master of charm. 
 You can see how he flirts with the horrible truth of those decades, when he drifted, almost invisibly, through Europe and the Americas. 
 They had a trial. 
 They said he was too crazy to execute. 
 Of course, he's crazy. 
 Anyone who'd eat people. 
 I mean... 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe. 
 I guess with Wolfe... he's an exception. 
 Well, he's the worst one, but... 
 I mean, it's like my mom, right? 
 She's a Powers publicist. 
 So I see all the bullshit. 
 I mean, all of them are full of bullshit. 
 Not all of them. 
 You know the problem is, they're still people. 
 And people make mistakes, right? 
 But when we make mistakes, it's like so what, we can fix it. 
 They make mistakes... 
 I mean one Powers mistake can kill hundreds of people. 
 It's like having a bunch of Godzillas on the loose. 
 Except everyone thinks they're super cool. 
 Before the Sky Terrace Amphitheater slaughter in 2004, before the Powers kids massacre in The Sanction Lounge in 1994, how many people do we know, he killed. 
 We may never have a proper count. 
 Thousands. Undoubtedly thousands. 
 Thousands of unsolved deaths, and missing persons that no one could have thought to associate with the charismatic, mysterious Power Wolfe. 
 All right. 
 So, jus-just keep your comments brief, OK? 
 Say, um, uh, I'm here to help. 
 Oh my god. 
 That's perfect. Did you just come up with that? 
 Shut up, Paola. 
 No, f*ck you, Craig, she shouldn't be here. 
 This is not the rollout that we had planned. 
 Look, we go in their green room, and we wait this thing out. 
 Don't forget to... hey! 
 Don't forget to say your name! 
 You have a great look. What... Tell us your name. 
 What's your name? 
 Despite the risk of Powers intervention, pressure is increasing for Retro Girl to abandon her Hurricane Pulp rescue effort, and jump into the fray at The Shaft. 
 At this point, it is a Category Four, but gaining strength. 
 They say by the time it hits land... 
 Winds are 150 mph. 
 153. 
 Oh, and it's almost a Category Five. 
 The outflow, is it 36,000... 
 Excuse me, ma'am. 
 I have that update from The Shaft. 
 They're saying that some cop has been killed and there's a possibility that Level 8 has been breached. 
 You should go. 
 We can get the Chinooks up. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 ... Get to the site in ten minutes. 
 That won't work, nothing can fly out there. 
 All right, sweetheart, these are my friends, and they're gonna look after you. 
 They're gonna give you food, and dry clothes. 
 And you are gonna be just fine. 
 I will find your brother. 
 I promise you. 
 Come on, sweetheart. Come with me. 
 If Wolfe is on Level 8... 
 No, no, not yet. 
 I couldn't find her brother. 
 You put me in here. 
 Why... Why... Why... 
 Crap! 
 I don't want to be this anymore. 
 We gotta get him out of here. Powers are coming. 
 I tried. I tried. I tried. 
 Kill... me You can't kill him, OK? 
 He... he's our teacher. 
 He... he.. he... he's like... 
 f*cking listen! 
 We can't kill him because killers can't be heroes! 
 But we can. 
 We stopped him. 
 People are gonna think that we stopped him. 
 If we can capture him, we'll be... we'll be it, man. 
 This is what we want. 
 We'll be f*cking heroes! 
 No! I want it. I want it back! 
 Give it back. 
 There goes Triphammer's video feed. 
 It's time to send 'em in. 
 They'd just feed Wolfe. 
 Where's Retro Girl? 
 We don't know. 
 Last word, she was still in the storm. 
 Someone's gotta do something. 
 f*ck it, I'm out. 
 Hold on. 
 No, you hold on. 
 That's my green light. 
 This is not a show. 
 And I'm not a f*cking performer. 
 I'm here to help. 
 Keep your eyes moving at all times. 
 Watch your periphery and don't turn your back on him, ever. 
 You killed him. 
 I would eat you. 
 But you're a f*cking robot. 
 We have to get him out of here. Powers are coming. 
 Powers are coming. 
 Johnny. 
 Johnny wouldn't take me with him, Christian. 
 Why? 
 He came to me, over and over. 
 But he wouldn't take me with him. 
 What did he want from me? 
 Anything to do with that red in your eyes? 
 I want my powers back! 
 Your powers. 
 Your powers? 
 Your powers are gone. I shat them out. 
 Your powers... 
 I used them up, you f*cking asshole. 
 There's nothing in me that's yours. And you can't have any of mine. 
 I want them back! 
 No! 
 
 
 
 Get... Out... Out of there you rancid, foul tasting, sh1t. 
 I see you, old man. I... see... you. 
 No! 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 Don't worry. I've been living for this. 
 Are you gonna be a f*cking hero with me? 
 Or are you gonna puss out? 
 Then I'm throwing him... down the f*cking Shaft. 
 How does it feel to be powerless? 
 Help me. 
 Please. 
 You're pathetic, old man. 
 If we can capture him, we're gonna be f*cking heroes. 
 Heroes, heroes, hereos, hereos, hereos. 
 ... It's a mystery... 
 Hold on... 
 They got him. 
 How did you do it? 
 How did you do it? 
 Coming through. Coming through. 
 Just tell us in your own words how you did it. 
 I... 
 I... 
 I knocked Wolfe down. 
 And... ah... 
 What's your name? 
 My name is Zora. 
 Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 We've gotta run. 
 A new hero is born, and her name is Zora. 
 In her own words, she took out Wolfe with a single blow. 
 Zora may be a well heeled graduate of the Manchester Academy, but as these photos show, she's not above slummin' it with the Powers kids. 
 Zora's interests extent beyond defeating supervillains. 
 She's also a well-known maven of the fashion world. 
 That costume? 
 She designed it herself. 
 Purple is the new black. 
 You heard it here first. 
 I hate her. 
 She does seem pretty full of herself. 
 She's acting like she's the only one on the planet right now. 
 What about all the people that died today? 
 What about them? 
 It's cool, but what is it? 
 When Powers are around people die. 
 I mean, it doesn't matter if they're good or bad, there's always collateral damage. 
 And no one ever talks about that. 
 You know, this is... education. 
 You know, I mean... 
 We're just trying to raise awareness. 
 We? Who... who's "we"? 
 Well, I was hoping you'd help me. 
 Federal agencies report Wolfe has been recaptured by Zora, and is being kept under control by a revolutionary new technology. 
 Dubbed "The Drainer" by it's inventor, Harley "Triphammer" Cohen, this device may be the game changer Powers Law Enforcement has long sought. 
 This highly effective tool in Powers control will signal a new era for our division. 
 Despite our terrible losses, despite our losses, we will be stronger, than ever. 
 What's the tool called? 
 They take everything from us. 
 It's called a Drainer. 
 It's simplest terms, the green light goes on the powers go off. 
 They'll make us be alone. 
 Yeah, alone and trapped. 
 I want all the Sway we have. 
 I want every dose that's out there. 
 I want if off the streets. 
 And I want the name of every kid who's taken it. 
 Now! 
 Do it now! 
 sh1t! 
 There he is. 
 Hey. 
 Oh... is Wolfe still... ? 
 Locked up Don't you remember? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 That purple girl, Zora, she got him. 
 Good. 
 Good. Um, Deena, my partner? 
 She... 
 She's all right. 
 She's getting taped up. 
 Yeah, thank god for Zora. 
 Thank god for the new blood. 
 I could feel his breath, Christian. 
 I could feel his breath on the back of my neck. 
 You were saved. 
 By Zora. 
 Girl's got the power. 
 She's a headcase, but... she's got the power. 
 At least she'll fit in with the rest of us, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, you.. remember when we first met? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 I was such a punk. 
 I liked punks. 
 Lucky for me. 
 Christian, you... you were never as bad as you thought you were. 
 I could have been better. 
 We could all be better. 
 Hey. 
 In the hurricane, there was a... there was this little boy... and I found him. He... he wasn't... he... 
 And I promised, you know? 
 Why can't I learn not to promise? I have to learn not to promise. 
 Because I can't save them all. 
 It's OK. 
 It's OK. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. I'm just so tired. 
 It's OK. You can... you can you can take a rest. 
 You deserve a rest. 
 Come on. 
 You don't have to do it all yourself. 
 You know? You... you can have help. 
 When... when someone's there, all... all you have to do is ask. 
 People wanna help. 
 You just have to ask. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm so tired. 
 It's OK. 
 You sleep. 
 I got this, OK? 
 I got this watch. 
 You sleep. 
 Janis. 
 We're capable of... so much, you know? 
 People don't know what we're capable of. 
 Hey. 
 Christian. 
 Hello, Christian. 
 I'm Janis. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Is there something... ? 
 Yeah, well... 
 You see, I'd love to buy you a drink. 
 But seeing as I'm broke, I... can't. 
 But the music's free. 
 Got you covered on that.
