 Previously on Powers... 
 We can't turn his powers off. 
 We can only retard them. 
 Wolfe was this... rock-star philosopher badass. 
 Wolfe was our teacher. 
 But you put Wolfe away. 
 Christian... 
 He went crazy. 
 He killed my friends. 
 Sway. 
 It's a total boost. 
 That's an unregulated powers enhancer. 
 My name's Zora. 
 Zora. 
 Your agent doesn't seem to recognize your dead friend. 
 You are one Powers pwning m*therf*cker. 
 You know what they didn't get right in this game? 
 No regular people die. 
 Retro Girl is not a person. 
 She's the over-exposed image that's being sold to you. 
 Do what you have to do You're coming with us. We are the police. 
 OK? Enough of this. 
 They can't take you away from your home. 
 You know how to get out of here? 
 Yeah. 
 I do. 
 You came back for me. 
 I thought you forgot me. 
 I didn't forget. 
 He ate them! 
 He f*ckin' ate those people. 
 He f*ckin' ate them! 
 f*ck! f*ck, f*ck! 
 They were hurting me. 
 I know I shouldn't... but they've been hurting me for so long... 
 I just wanted them to stop. 
 I don't... 
 I don't really like this... 
 I... 
 This... 
 This isn't me. 
 I'm not like this. 
 See? 
 I remember... things... 
 Johnny... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I never wanted to hurt... anyone. 
 Guess she f*cked it up. 
 No. It was me. 
 I mean... 
 Yeah, her standards were impossible to live up to. 
 Don't... get me wrong. I wanna hear as much Retro Girl gossip as I can, but... 
 I meant she f*cked it up back there. 
 You had Calista, she was right there with you and that woman... she f*cked it up. 
 Jesus sh1t! 
 Is there anything she won't sell? 
 That's how you make a living. 
 It's not like... being a Power comes with a paycheck. 
 Not a lot of high-paying jobs you can walk into just 'cause you can fly, or walk through walls, bench-press five tons. 
 Yeah I remember your Trojan ad. 
 Yeah, that was my last endorsement deal. 
 People aren't interested in buying things from someone who's ordinary. 
 That's not sexy. 
 Yeah, us ordinary people. We're a sorry bunch. 
 I know a place. 
 There'll be no one around to hurt you. 
 No one for you. 
 You'd be safe. 
 I have to be there alone? 
 It's cold there, and... and it's dark. 
 But in the summertime, the light comes and... and you won't believe how many birds are there. 
 Birds? 
 I like birds. 
 Unmasking, writing the book... it put me back on the radar for... fifteen minutes. 
 And f*ck Cross came looking when he did. 
 Is that... why you became a cop? 
 To keep off the convention circuit? 
 Why did you become a cop? 
 I mean besides... your dad trying to turn you into the son he never had. 
 I became a cop 'cause I like helping people. 
 And I like how... a new day is never the same. 
 And because my dad raised me to be the son he never had. 
 But f*ck you anyway. 
 Well... 
 Cross needed a face to sell Powers division to the voters. 
 My face had recently become available... 
 And I was always good at being famous. 
 So it seemed like a good idea. 
 Let's get you out of here, huh? 
 Before we go... 
 He hurt me. 
 So much. 
 And I am so hungry. 
 No, no! 
 No! 
 You know you're better than that! 
 You're more than that! 
 Walker, this is Cross. 
 I'm at the Shaft. 
 Wolfe has escaped containment. 
 What the f*ck... 
 Put Suppression Unit into Level 9. 
 No. 
 What happened? Was it Royalle? 
 Not Royalle. 
 Wolfe broke out of his restraints. 
 Stage the unit outside his cell. 
 The Lobotomy Team went in... 
 He killed at least one of the guards. 
 Suppression Unit's being dispatched. 
 No, keep the unit out. 
 Walker, it's Triphammer. 
 We have to send in the unit. 
 Hartley? 
 He'll just eat them and get more powerful. If he's contained, we have time. 
 We lost the cameras in his cell, we're blind. 
 He's already fed once... 
 He's too powerful for a Suppression Unit. 
 Kill me. 
 I told you to kill me. You couldn't then. 
 And now? 
 Not easy to kill. 
 Not the ones you love. 
 Leave him alone. 
 When we lost the cameras in his cell, there was a distortion. 
 Royalle's powers signature. 
 He didn't free Wolfe, but... 
 We think he entered the cell. 
 I have to know if Wolfe is in his cell or at large. 
 There are protocols. 
 Send in the Suppression Unit. 
 They're coming to hurt me. I need to be strong. 
 If you're not gonna kill me or let me go free, then... 
 Don't move! 
 Hold it right there! 
 Stay in position. Right there! 
 Everything OK? 
 Ha, it's just my mom. 
 Does she need you? Should you... 
 No, it's cool. 
 She's just... you know... 
 No, she's been through a lot. 
 With your dad and... 
 All of that. 
 It's cool, you know? 
 Your mom needs you. You should go home. 
 OK. 
 I don't know which way to go. 
 Go left, then all the way down, take a right at the van that looks like Godzilla trampled it. 
 All right. Well... later. 
 Hey... 
 Are you gonna give me your number or what? 
 What do we do now? 
 We leave now. 
 We're packed up there. 
 I'm the only one working. It'll be a mess. 
 It doesn't matter. We're not coming back. We're done. I'm f*cked! 
 I've f*cked it up. 
 But we can fix it. 
 No. No, no, no, Simons, he's... he's awake now. 
 I f*cked up their schedule. 
 I poked him in his f*cking brain too many times it made his powers harder to heal him. 
 I've f*cked it up. 
 So we take a break. 
 Recalibrate. 
 No. No, no, no. We're getting out of here now. 
 Where's Calista? 
 You're supposed to collect her. 
 She wasn't there. 
 Look, want me to stay here and shut down the club? 
 The girl shows up... 
 I'll take care her. 
 She's coming with us. 
 I'm not gonna leave her behind to fend for herself. 
 I'll see you at the bar. 
 He's contained on Level 9. All personnel have been pulled out. 
 Any other Powers now on this level? 
 General population starts on Level 8. 
 What went wrong, Harley? 
 Powers are like muscles. 
 The more you use them, the stronger you get. 
 We scheduled his lobotomies to minimize the impact on his healing. 
 So what did you miss? 
 Bring up the video. 
 Royalle. 
 Each distortion lasts about 5 seconds, triggered by an electromagnetic pulse at either end. 
 Go back. 
 Each teleport causes just enough distortion to give him time in the cell. 
 Completely unseen by us. 
 Why didn't he just break Wolfe out? 
 He's been inflicting more damage on Wolfe, 'causing him to heal faster. 
 How or why he's doing it? 
 I don't have a f*cking clue. 
 He's been coming in here for months. 
 I fear so. 
 And you did not know? 
 I did not. 
 I want to show you something. 
 Well, hey, I know I'm the new guy here, but shouldn't we be calling some Powers for help? 
 Yeah. 
 The first name that comes to my mind is Retro Girl. 
 She's right, we need help. 
 No, we don't. 
 Walker, we can do this ourselves. 
 Come see. 
 Ourselves? 
 He just ate six people. 
 If Wolfe gets out... 
 We can contain him. I have a way. 
 I'm in love with you. I love you. Don't touch me! 
 Turn it off. 
 You need to get in front of this. 
 Do some interviews. 
 Damage control. 
 I went there to shut him down. 
 I failed. 
 Anything I say now just restarts the clock on the story. 
 That's the show, Eva. 
 But Hurricane Pulp is real, and that is the only subject that I will address now. 
 OK. 
 Fine. 
 Question is: has the iconic Retro Girl passed her prime? 
 Is she still relevant today? 
 This is ridiculous. What? 
 People make mistakes, you know that. 
 We can do it ourselves. 
 What the f*ck's going on? 
 I called it "the Drainer". 
 It takes away their powers. 
 This isn't possible. 
 How? 
 That would take more time than we have to explain. 
 But I will tell you I got the idea from you, Christian. 
 Before Wolfe drained your powers... 
 I would have never imagined it could be done. 
 I am such a fuck-up. 
 Don't. Don't say that. 
 That's not you saying that. 
 Calista... 
 We have to go. 
 What? I... I don't wanna go. 
 We have to go right now. 
 You can't keep doing that. You can't just grab me and take me somewhere without telling me where you're going! 
 You'll be safe here. I'll be right back! 
 Stop leaving me! 
 I don't have time to explain Calista. 
 No! 
 You do not get to abandon me. 
 Not like your sister, not like Annabelle. 
 There are four wings on each level Radiating from the elevator core, which we know is secure. 
 Each wing has a central core, with four spokes and two cells. 
 We need to clear each wing, spoke by spoke. 
 If you find Wolfe you retreat, you seal it in and you wait for the rest of us. 
 We will then try to drive him back into his cell, where the Drainer will be set up. 
 As soon as I get it up and running, I'll join the search. 
 Be aggressive, do not be picky about your targets, don't wait for a head-shot, he moves too quickly. 
 Aim for his trunk, you want to inflict as much damage as quickly as possible. 
 We need to overwhelm his healing power. 
 Is there any chance we get some f*cking backup with your security guards? 
 No, we want to minimize Wolfe's targets of opportunity. 
 If sh1t gets f*cked up, we don't want him to eat too many people all at once. 
 He can get too powerful. 
 So we're portion control. 
 Well, the fucker's gonna choke on me. 
 Got him! 
 Heads up, he's moving guys. 
 Wh... what's he looking for? 
 He can sense the electricity. 
 He can what the f*ck? 
 No. 
 The elevator runs off on a generator, come on. 
 OK. 
 We're on backups now. 
 So what changes then? 
 It's generally darker. 
 Thank you. And? 
 And the primary seals to Level 8 are down. 
 So? 
 Which makes it easier for him to find where the Powers are held. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 We'll figure out what to do, where to go. 
 I promise you that. 
 But we can never go back there. Never. 
 What do you mean? 
 I've made a terrible... mistake, Calista. 
 I've unleashed a monster on the world, again. 
 I don't understand what the hell you're talking about. 
 I'm talking about Sway. 
 I'm talking about Wolfe. 
 What? Wolfe... what you have to do with Wolfe? 
 I get Sway from Wolfe. 
 He gives you Sway? 
 But, he's in the Shaft... 
 Sway is Wolfe. 
 Wolfe has the unique ability to absorb powers and to increase them exponentially. 
 I thought I could  modify it, I thought I could change it on the molecular level. 
 Ever so slightly. 
 I thought it would allow people with limited powers to reach their full potential. 
 I thought... It doesn't matter what the f*ck I thought, he's loose now. 
 He's loose... because for the third time... 
 I couldn't do what he begged me to do. 
 Which was what? 
 Kill him. 
 He was like... a father to me. 
 I dreamed of killing my father so many times. 
 I've killed... many people... without a flicker of regret. But not him. 
 Not him. 
 It's not easy to kill the ones you love. 
 When I have my powers, the first thing I'm going to do is find my father. 
 And then I'm going to kill him. 
 And for every time he laid a fist on my mom, I will give him a hundred. 
 And I'm not gonna cry. 
 Not a single tear. 
 I'll join you as soon as I can. 
 Just make sure that f*cking thing works. 
 Just make sure you follow the f*cking plan this time. 
 I only have one leg left. 
 OK, people. Let's go. 
 Entering spoke four. 
 Copy that. 
 
 
 
 Six months, six months, six months... 
 Shut up. 
 You're gonna get me killed with you. 
 Seriously, a crossbow? 
 Took down El Chamuco with it in '98. 
 I never leave home without it. 
 How much longer, Harley? 
 Soon. 
 Have you gotten any dates? 
 Have you even set up a profile? 
 No, I haven't. 
 So you lied to me. 
 To get you off my f*cking back. 
 Dude, it's has been two years. 
 Clear. 
 Clear. 
 Ruth's single. 
 Oh my god, you're pissing me off. 
 Clear. 
 Closing. 
 You're giving up, that's the problem. 
 No, I haven't. 
 When was the last time you bought new clothes? 
 Who cares? 
 You've worn the same five outfits in rotation for the last six months. 
 What kind of person notices that? 
 It's not just me, dude. 
 Everybody notices. 
 Exposed L is clear. We're headed into the hub. 
 Copy that. 
 Wait... 
 You guys talk about it? 
 Did you hear that? 
 Outer ring clear. 
 Golden's down. Golden's down. 
 Kutter. 
 What's your status? 
 She's dead. Golden's dead. 
 Do you have a location on Wolfe? 
 Kutter? Kutter? 
 Come on. 
 We need to move. Let's go. 
 It's not too late. 
 Walker. 
 I had to try. 
 This sh1t is gonna kill you. 
 OK. OK, I got it. 
 Get it off. Get it off.. 
 OK. OK. Wait. 
 Deena. 
 Wolfe begged us... me and Johnny... 
 He begged us to kill him. 
 And we didn't. 
 I could have stopped him twenty years ago. 
 I could have killed him. 
 At the Sanction Lounge... 
 Royalle saved dozens of people from Wolfe. 
 I tried, but I couldn't do it. 
 He was too strong. 
 And then suddenly... 
 He stopped. 
 He stopped eating, stopped killing. 
 And he started crying... 
 He said... 
 "Kill me... Christian." 
 He bared his throat. 
 And all those people, who've died later... 
 I could have stopped him. 
 But I captured Wolfe instead. 
 Killers can't be heroes. 
 Capturing Wolfe made me a hero. 
 It made me famous. 
 Like... like I knew it would! 
 Walker's down. 
 I'm moving on alone. 
 Deena... 
 I don't need a f*cking hero, Walker, I need a partner. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Stay close. 
 Time is up, Chaykin. 
 Open the door! Open the door! 
 That's why Shaft's administration kept him isolated, right? 
 Yes. The Powers population at the Shaft is housed... 
 I can be there in 10 minutes. 
 It's just a media circus going on outside the fence. 
 We don't even know what's going on inside. 
 You said if something doesn't happen soon... 
 Number one: there's no way he's getting out of there. 
 Number two: if they were worried, they would have called in one of the bigs, and I'd know about it. 
 Number three: He eats people. 
 You don't think I can do it? 
 Look, Wolfe has taken down Powers with years of experience in action. Just... 
 You... you get some battles on your belt... 
 You work for me. 
 Not the other way around. 
 All right. 
 Let me find out who's down there. 
 This has gotta be your show, OK? 
 I'll call you back. 
 You said no one knew what your cousin's death meant to you. 
 Well, now all those Powers at the club know your name. 
 It's like psy ops, you know, getting in their heads. 
 Or I'm just lame. I don't know. 
 No. 
 No. 
 I get it. 
 It's cool. 
 It... makes me feel special. 
 Thank you. 
 Were you scared with all of them around? 
 No. 
 It felt good... 
 Exciting. 
 Like what I did mattered. 
 You know? 
 I want to do more. 
 You should. 
 Like what? 
 You did something for me, that I'll never forget. 
 What if you know, you did something for you, for your dad, so that they'll never forget. 
 Well, it has to be big. 
 I want them to know that we're not weak. 
 I can help you. 
 How? 
 I already told you. I got skills. 
 Chaykin is down. 
 Wolfe is sealed in spoke four. 
 I'm in the outer ring, spoke four. 
 If you drive him down the spoke, I can follow him back to the central corridor, and into his cell. 
 Hold that position, Detective. I'm coming to you. 
 We'll link up with you both at the intersection. 
 Kutter, what's your twenty? 
 Kutter? 
 It seems Kutter's down. 
 Triphammer, we move on your signal. 
 I've got Adlard and Zabriski with me. 
 Adlard. 
 No! Don't! 
 No more of my friends die. 
 Don't! Walker, don't! No! 
 Christian? 
 Is that you? 
 I thought I saw your fall. 
 I thought it was a dream. 
 f*cking fuckers. 
 They threw you in here, too. 
 But we're together now. 
 We're trying to get out. 
 They can't stop the both of us. 
 Christian. 
 Are you all right? What did they do to you? 
 f*ck! We have to get out of here. 
 They are trying to kill us. 
 They don't know what we're capable of. 
 Wolfe has killed and consumed at least seven Shaft's guards. 
 What does that mean for his powers? 
 Wolfe gets stronger every time he feeds. 
 But the real risk are are incurred if he eats a Power. 
 His tremendous baseline strength, speed and regenerative abilities... will increase exponentially. 
 This popped up on my feed. 
 My source confirms Wolfe has broken containment and is loose inside the Shaft. 
 Powers Division is here, but their record in handling major Powers is far from... 
 You want me to call Triphammer and tell him you're coming? 
 No, if there were any danger of him reaching the surface, he would have called. 
 The more people I help to evacuate before this hurricane... the better. Keep me informed. 
 Be careful. 
 Detective Pilgrim, what happened? 
 Walker? 
 Jesus, sh1t. 
 f*ck. 
 Is he... 
 What did Walker do? 
 He went in... by himself. 
 Is he... 
 No, he's not there. Neither is Wolfe. 
 Wolfe has escaped containment into the ring, he could be anywhere on Level 9. 
 Walker and Pilgrim? 
 I've got eyes on Pilgrim. 
 Walker is missing. 
 We're heading over to you. 
 No. 
 No, go back to Central Watch. 
 The Drainer is activated in Wolfe's cell. All I have to do is throw him in there. 
 We can cover more ground if we... 
 Emile! 
 For f*ck's sake. 
 Take your people out of here before they get eaten. 
 Copy. We're headed out. 
 I'll escort you to the elevator. 
 Oh, the f*ck you will. 
 Detective! 
 This is not a job for regular cops. 
 Good thing we're not regular cops. 
 If your partner's still alive... it's only because Wolfe wants him to be. 
 If you go in there... 
 You end up like Golden. 
 Or Mack, or Chaykin, or Argento. 
 You would be lunch. 
 And trust me... he'll still want dinner. 
 You've been in a lot of places. 
 I've gotten good at hiding. 
 But you came back... to your home. 
 Why did you want to make Sway for the kids? 
 'Cause it's a horrible feeling being powerless. 
 At someone else's mercy. 
 But I f*cked it up. 
 It can still work. 
 You have a bunch of Sway, right? 
 But now... 
 Now... 
 We have to hide. 
 I'll go get Simons... 
 We'll find some place safe... we'll gather our strength, figure out a new strategy. 
 And go where? 
 Anywhere. Literally. 
 You choose. 
 Johnny, no. 
 There must be some place. 
 You have to go back. 
 You have to kill Wolfe. 
 I don't think that's possible. 
 You set him free! 
 People are going to die. 
 If I go back... 
 If I do what needs to be done... if I come out of it alive... will you wait? 
 Always. 
 No matter what, no matter when. 
 Thank you. 
 Will you do something for me? 
 I can't help you get your powers. 
 No. 
 I want you to help me to kill my father. 
 I can do that. 
 Then let's go home. 
 Our home. 
 Better. 
 Everything's ready here. 
 Change of plans. 
 We're staying. 
 No more running away, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I'll get back to work, then. 
 They caught him yet? 
 Not yet. 
 I have to go back. 
 I shouldn't have left him behind. 
 If Johnny was here, he could just... 
 But he was here. 
 He left me. Christian, I think he's... he's working with them, I think... 
 He did something... to me. 
 There's power here. 
 Oh, f*ck him, no! 
 What the f*ck... 
 Go to the elevator. Go. 
 Now! 
 I found a unsealed hatch. 
 He's on eight. 
 If he eats... even a few significant Powers... he can become very strong. 
 How strong? 
 Strong enough to rip through those gates like they were tinfoil. 
 No, Landry. We need to get a young face down there. 
 Hey... what does Paola say about her hottie in purple and black? 
 Yeah, Zora, yeah, w... is she... 
 Swear to f*ck, Paola's an idiot! 
 If I had Zora, I would have her front and... 
 It doesn't matter. She doesn't have to do anything, just stand there and look badass. 
 #Zora. 
 Hey. You OK? 
 Yeah. 
 I just, uh... 
 I was thinking about you. 
 But you just saw me. 
 I know. 
 You just met me. 
 I know. 
 You're watching this thing at the Shaft? 
 It's so f*cked up. 
 It makes me want to not be alone. 
 Yeah? 
 I... when I was a kid, I used to have Wolfe nightmares. 
 Really bad. 
 Everybody's had a Wolfe nightmare. 
 Get out of my way. 
 When I met you... 
 I can use what's in there to get us out of here. 
 Do you remember me... teacher? 
 You... were... lost. 
 You were a cocky little sh1t. 
 Yeah, we... 
 We didn't know. Me, Johnny, all of us... 
 We didn't know who we were, what we could be. 
 No, this, this isn't you. 
 This is not who you are. 
 You are working with them, making me see things. 
 You cannot do it Christian, you cannot turn me into something I am not! 
 I... am... power.
