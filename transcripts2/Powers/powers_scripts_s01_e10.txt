 Previously on Powers... 
 You know what Sway is? It's Wolfe. 
 I'm gonna kill him with or without you. 
 We bust Royalle and drain Wolfe. 
 That is the plan. 
 I'm gonna teleport in there with a gun and shoot him in the f*cking head. 
 How do you arrest a teleporter? 
 You have to disable him like that. 
 Drainer. 
 Click, click. 
 Is that where your friends have set the trap for me? 
 There is no trap. 
 It has to happen fast. 
 Press the button, green light comes on, door closes. 
 f*cking... 
 Look after Calista. 
 I need someone I can trust. 
 Oh, sh1t, what's... 
 You killed me. 
 Kill him! 
 The world as you know it is going to end soon. 
 This is your fault. 
 I'm a Power. 
 You push me far enough, that may be just what it takes to switch me on. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Why do you smell like me? 
 Walker? 
 Wolfe took out Shaft control. 
 Get remote communications up. 
 Make sure Metro and CHP know that Powers Division is running the grid. 
 Full lockdown! 
 Nothing moves in there. 
 How strong is he? How much has he fed? 
 He's not interested in eating people. 
 He can kill and absorb the powers of anybody who took Sway. 
 The Kidz. 
 How many Kidz took Sway? 
 At least 100, probably more. 
 If he gets that much power... 
 Black Swan. 
 We have got to stop him before he finds those Kidz. 
 If I can get close enough to him, I can absorb his powers... 
 You gotta be f*cking kidding me. 
 It would have been a hell of a lot easier if he was still locked up in his cell. 
 I cannot believe after everything that has happened you are still stuck on that. 
 You're gonna lay this at my feet? 
 For once in your life, just stick to the f*cking plan. 
 If you had trusted me, I would have Wolfe's powers and he would be harmless. 
 How could we have trusted you? 
 How can we trust you now? 
 Because I'm the only one who can do it. 
 What are the other options? 
 I have two working Drainer prototypes. 
 A one-shot pulse. 
 And a Drainer pod to bring him back here. 
 No. 
 You cannot bring him back here. 
 Not this time. 
 He's right. 
 The Drainer pulse isn't strong enough to take him out, but it should disable him long enough for us to get an opening. 
 To do what? 
 To overload and detonate the Drainer pod core. 
 Will that kill him? 
 Kill him or permanently drain him and any other Power in direct contact with the blast. 
 And if that doesn't take care of it, then a bullet will finish the job. 
 Who's gonna get that close? 
 You, Harley? 
 He has kicked your ass every time you've faced him. 
 Emile, your hands start shaking whenever you even think about him. 
 I'll do it. 
 No. 
 I am the best shot we have at this. 
 If Wolfe is hunting Kidz, he'll head for the Strip. 
 We seal him off before he gets there. 
 Triphammer moves in with his pulse weapon and Powers Division personnel will overload the pod core. 
 When he killed Simons, he effectively absorbed 19 powers. 
 Wolfe dies tonight. 
 I'll radio when I have him in my sight. 
 Track him, Janice, do not engage. 
 Emile. 
 Emile. 
 Emile, you cannot leave me out of this. 
 I'm not. You will observe from here. 
 No one knows Wolfe better than you. 
 You can advise us in the field. 
 Take it or leave it, Detective. 
 I need you to stay with Walker, keep an eye on him. 
 What did I do? 
 You're his partner. 
 Let's go. 
 Los Angeles is in full lockdown after Wolfe's escape from the Shaft. 
 Commander Cross of LA Powers Division and the Federal Powers Bureau have issued Category Five Powers warning protocols. 
 All Powers with flying capabilities are asked to report in to their Power's warning commanders. 
 We will bring you non-stop, live, up-to-date coverage until Wolfe is contained. 
 Under no circumstances should any Powers or non-Powers approach or engage with Wolfe. 
 We have a sighting. Wolfe has been sighted. 
 Get your sight lines now! 
 What is he doing? 
 If you're going to make a move, do it now, Harley. 
 Why are his eyes closed? 
 He's looking for a trace of Kidz' power. 
 Once he has the scent, he'll be gone. 
 Seal it off, north and south of Figueroa. 
 Retro Girl, I'm moving into position. 
 Where are... 
 Move, move, move. Guys, he doesn't care about you. 
 You're nothing to him now. 
 Prep the Drainer core and move in behind me. 
 Don't move until after I fire the pulse. 
 Stay close to the buildings. 
 What the f*ck? 
 sh1t. 
 Zora, the young Power who singlehandedly brought Wolfe down during his last escape attempt is confronting Wolfe. 
 Rematch, m*therf*cker! 
 What do we do? 
 Hold here. 
 She needs help. 
 Hold here. 
 sh1t. 
 For f*ck's sake, Harley, get her out of there We're going in. 
 Janice, do not engage. 
 What is he waiting on? 
 For Wolfe to be distracted. 
 Feeding. 
 No, no, no. 
 You have a Wolfe-shaped space in your soul. 
 I carved it out the last time we danced together. 
 Be ready to move in behind me. 
 And I will live in there forever. 
 Because you can never beat me. 
 Beat this. 
 Yes. 
 Go, go, go, go, go. 
 Holy sh1t, the pulse cannon malfunctioned. 
 f*ck! 
 We need medical. Zora and Triphammer are down. 
 f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! 
 Who's got eyes on Wolfe? 
 He went into the Metro tunnel. He's underground. 
 Can you take your powers out of him, so we can kill him? 
 'Cause there's no margin for error left. 
 Can you really do it? 
 He's more powerful now, but... 
 Yeah. 
 I can do it. 
 But I need your help. I can't do it alone. 
 And I need you to trust me. 
 Okay. 
 She's not moving. 
 I think she's dead. 
 That's her paying for your mom's life, Krispin. 
 She should be held accountable. 
 I don't want her to die. 
 With the information on your mom's laptop, the whole dirty Powers Industrial Entertainment Complex will be held accountable. 
 Especially Retro Girl. 
 We are now entering the second hour of the frantic search to locate the mass murderer known as Wolfe. 
 Since he was last seen 65 minutes ago at the Strip, we have no new updates as to his whereabouts. 
 Authorities also warn that, given Wolfe's speed, he could turn up anywhere at any time. 
 The entire city is holding its breath tonight as all our hopes rest on local Powers and law enforcement officials who, we pray, will somehow find Wolfe. 
 Thank you, Delia. 
 And now here's Melissa with the latest details from our crisis coverage team. 
 We're gonna keep you updated on all further developments on this story. 
 Meanwhile, our experts have constructed a time line that includes a historical account of all of Wolfe's known crimes. 
 In a moment... 
 You have no reason to be afraid of me. 
 Or anything else, for that matter. 
 You are something really quite special. 
 Is there somewhere around here where we could talk, that's quiet? 
 We don't even know if Wolfe is inside the search perimeter at this point. 
 Series Seven and Backflash have been searching with broad spectrum vision. 
 No sign. He must have gone underground somewhere. 
 All right, we search the grid, find the Powerz Kidz, find Wolfe. 
 Let's go. 
 All right, let's go. Move out. 
 Hmm. 
 Feeding time? Gloating time? 
 Or am I to receive a lobotomy? 
 We need your help. 
 f*ck you! 
 Wolfe is on the loose. 
 He's gonna go after the Kidz, Johnny. 
 Let him eat the Kidz. 
 Let him eat the whole f*cking world. 
 There's not one f*cking person on this rock I give a f*cking sh1t about. 
 Really? 
 What about Calista? 
 He will go after Calista, Johnny. 
 I know where he'll go. 
 Can you take us there? 
 I want Simons. 
 Wolfe got Simons. 
 It's true. 
 I'm sorry. 
 He got all of him. 
 Get me out of this f*cking thing now. 
 Now! 
 I can sign it for you. 
 You said I'm special. 
 But you knew that already. 
 People act like I'm stupid or crazy when I say it. 
 When you say... 
 I'm a Power. 
 Are you? 
 There's something missing inside of me. 
 A hole. 
 I can feel it there. 
 I've tried everything to fill it. 
 Yes. 
 An emptiness and a deep hunger to fill that void. 
 I know how you feel. 
 Can you help me? 
 Power is the ability to exert your will on the world around you. 
 Anyone who says otherwise is selling something. 
 Like maybe a book. 
 I can help. 
 If you would like to try. 
 They're right outside. 
 Waiting to be plucked. 
 I am not suggesting this is easy. 
 But life is a wearying endeavor. 
 And you have to make a choice. 
 You have to decide how much of it you really want. 
 The little bit that is rationed to everyone. 
 Or a heaping bounty that you must reap for yourself. 
 You want another taste? 
 Because there's no one else like me and that is a lonely feeling, and we can all feel it. 
 And the world keeps telling us... 
 They're still alive. 
 For now. 
 I'm calling Cross. sh1t. 
 Powers Division. Give me your phone. 
 Get the Kidz out of here now. 
 It's Pilgrim, sir. I'm with Walker. 
 What the hell? 
 We have Wolfe in Royalle's club. We need backup now. 
 All right, Powers Division. Closing time, everybody out! 
 Let's go. 
 I need you to move it quickly, people. Thank you. 
 
 
 
 Finally. 
 Calista. 
 If you try and touch her, Johnny... You, too, Christian. 
 And I'm not half-demented or bullet-ridden this time. 
 We're not going to try anything. Just let her leave. 
 I don't think she wants to leave. 
 Do you? 
 You have misconstrued me entirely. 
 Always. 
 You thought I was grooming you for some great ascension. 
 And then, when I lost my composure, you thought I had been fattening you like cattle. 
 Wrong! 
 You wanted a family. 
 A legacy. 
 A family that could outlast me. 
 I never meant to eat them. They were just so ripe. 
 Just like them out there. 
 You can't have them. 
 I'm not gonna send you to the Shaft this time, old man. 
 I going to give you something that I think you've earned. 
 A chance to redeem the past. 
 He's gonna drain the Kidz! 
 Aah! 
 We're too late! 
 We're too late. 
 My legacy... 
 The beginning of it, anyway. 
 I should have done this long ago! 
 Yes, you should have. 
 It's too late now. 
 No! Where the f*ck did he take him? 
 Not far. 
 Stand back. 
 Walker, get ready. 
 Deena, be ready to take the shot. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, my God. 
 sh1t! 
 Do it, Christian! 
 Not today, Christian. 
 There's no reason for you two to see what happens next. 
 Let me at least spare you that. 
 Be ready to take the shot. 
 If you drain me, you drain yourself. 
 I know. 
 We're your legacy, old man, Johnny Royalle has just emerged from Here and Gone with the head of Wolfe. 
 In the shocking conclusion to the night's events, Wolfe's one-time apostle, Johnny Royalle, has apparently killed his former master. 
 Staged for the pleasure of the ignorant masses. 
 They killed Wolfe. 
 So they say. 
 Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! 
 The number of young Powers who died are not yet confirmed, but no doubt it would have been greater had Johnny Royalle not intervened. 
 Here we go again. 
 Well, turn it the f*ck off if you don't like it. 
 Like you're not pissed Royalle's getting all the credit. 
 f*ck you. 
 What's in your ass? 
 Have you seen Walker today? 
 I'll go look. 
 ... no longer tolerated, especially by his own peers. 
 The city is safe once again. 
 You have a Wolfe-shaped space in your soul. 
 And I will live in there forever. 
 Hey. 
 Zora, did you hear what I said? 
 I heard you. 
 I'm... 
 ... just not in the mood to listen. 
 You're gonna... 
 You're gonna have a great career. 
 It's just... 
 I can't... 
 I can't work with somebody who won't take my advice. 
 You're gonna be huge, kiddo, and I'm gonna be the asshole that walked away from you. 
 sh1t. 
 So, what did asshole want? 
 To wish me luck learning how to walk again. 
 You don't need him, you know. 
 He's right. I f*cked up. 
 Yeah, you f*cked up royally. 
 You went in there alone, when you knew you shouldn't, because you had something to prove. 
 f*cked up royally. 
 So now what? 
 Now you own it. 
 People will still respect you if you own it. 
 You're still you. 
 Don't walk away from that. 
 Do you ever even listen to your own bullshit? 
 Get better, Z-girl. 
 Will you come see me again? 
 Not if you're gonna whine. 
 f*ck you. 
 People keep saying that to me. 
 I thought we could celebrate. 
 I'm back on the wagon. 
 But everything has leveled off, right? 
 The Black Swan threat has diminished. 
 Green all over. No red in sight. 
 We dodged a bullet, my friend. 
 For now. 
 And I would like to be sober enough to enjoy it. 
 Ah... 
 The hero of the day. 
 It's always been the difference between you and me. 
 In the midst of unspeakable carnage, you still consider how it plays to the masses. 
 Mmm. 
 I don't know, Johnny. 
 Wolfe is dead. 
 You're the man that killed him. 
 The DA won't charge you with anything we've brought her. 
 And every young Power in the world wants to learn at your feet. 
 I'd say things have worked out exactly as you wanted. 
 What I wanted is in shambles. 
 Wanna see something rad? Here and Gone, dude. 
 Now, if only we could do some sh1t like that in front of "the powers that be" cameras, we'd be f*cking made, dude. 
 You f*cking did it, man. 
 Johnny f*cking Royalle, you did it, pal! 
 Were we ever really friends, Christian? 
 Once. 
 How's Calista? 
 Ask her yourself. 
 Come in. 
 Hey. 
 I just thought I'd check up on you. 
 I'm okay. I'm just ready to leave here. 
 Where are you going? 
 The Kidz house. It's empty. 
 I thought if I was there, I might help anyone that was lost. 
 Calista. 
 I told you once that I could feel where my powers used to be. 
 I used to reach for them, and feel so powerless when they weren't there. 
 And I don't know if it was the Drainer bomb or something else, but that phantom limb is gone, and so is that feeling. 
 But I'm not powerless. 
 And neither are you. 
 I know. 
 Really. 
 Call me if you need help. 
 I will. 
 You promise? 
 I promise. 
 Okay. 
 We're in. 
 What do we have? 
 Everything. 
 We know everything their Powers clients are doing and going to do, we know where they are and where they're going, and we know all their dirty little secrets. 
 Gosh, two times in one month. 
 I'm gonna get spoiled. 
 You still thinking about making this the new normal? 
 Are you talking about me ditching Retro Girl or are you talking about you and me? 
 Both. 
 Well, wouldn't that be nice? 
 We never did get the chance to just be Janice and Christian when we were together, did we? 
 It was always, "It's Retro Girl and Diamond." 
 Do you remember that night when we were in bed and you called me Queen Noir? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I'm sorry. 
 I should have thrown you right out that window. 
 You did throw me out the window. 
 Did I? 
 Yeah, remember? 
 Oh. 
 Good for me. You deserved it. 
 Come on, you had the whole thing with Super Shock. 
 Well, Patrick was my ex. 
 We always reconnected when I was on my own. 
 So... 
 I can't retire, Christian. 
 I know. 
 The minute I heard about Wolfe, I knew that there was no possible way I could have stayed away. 
 Told you. I know. 
 So, what about that other thing? 
 What, you? 
 I know what I want. The question is, do you? 
 What are you doing tonight? 
 I have to go back on patrol. 
 They need to know I'm out there. 
 Okay, sure, yeah. 
 Is it work? 
 Yeah. 
 Deena's been chasing me all morning. 
 Probably thinks I'm out grabbing a nooner. 
 I have an hour. 
 Really? 
 Johnny. Where'd you go? 
 I was running an errand. 
 In Hong Kong. 
 We could... we could go if you like. 
 Johnny, I... 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Well, I'll be here. 
 I know. 
 You made this happen, Krispin. 
 Kaotic Chic wouldn't exist without you. 
 You ready to change the world? 
 Hey, partner. 
 Where the f*ck you been? 
 Uh... 
 Doing things. 
 I've been trying to find you all day. 
 Well, Mom, uh, mostly doing fun things that are none of your business. 
 Mmm, so... 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I have something to show you. 
 So show me.
