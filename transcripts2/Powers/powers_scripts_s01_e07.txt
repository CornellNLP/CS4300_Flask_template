 Previously on Powers... 
 I shouldn't have done what I did. 
 Are you talking about locking me in a cell or taking Sway? 
 Is it real? 
 I made the Sway from Wolfe's blood. 
 So f*cking what? 
 It let Walker take Wolfe's power. 
 You told me you wanted to be an A-lister. 
 Model yourself after one. 
 I got them back, Janice. 
 What? 
 I had my powers again. 
 When I touched Wolfe, it was like I was sucking my powers back out of him. 
 I threw him through the floor. 
 I tossed him into his cell. 
 When he was under the drainer, my power disappeared. 
 I felt myself being emptied out. 
 What did you just feel? 
 I felt hunger. 
 No one goes in without me. 
 Only when my powers are drained permanently will the world be safe. 
 This is my deepest wish, and I humbly ask the courts to grant it. 
 Hmm... Now, how does this go again? 
 The flower. God, the flower. 
 Always the same f*cking thing. 
 ... the mass murderer Wolfe made his shocking plea, the possibility of permanently draining him has become a polarizing lightning rod for public opinion. 
 In an effort to quell a rising tide of unrest, Superior Court Judge Stephen Tanaka is expected to make his ruling today. 
 Meanwhile, a legal team assembled and financed by the mysterious and notorious Johnny Royalle... 
 ... is conniving to arrange a humanitarian visit with Wolfe. 
 Enough of this sh1t. 
 My record for standing up for Powers' rights is well established. 
 So is your prison record. 
 I spent three years in the Shaft for protesting registration laws. 
 I'm a known humanitarian. 
 Johnny, as your lawyer, I want nothing more than to accrue billable hours. 
 But until we can establish for a fact that the Drainer is physically harmful, you don't have a prayer of getting in there to see Wolfe. 
 Johnny! 
 Oh, Johnny. Thank goodness. Mind if I join you? 
 One restraining order isn't enough, Detective? 
 I don't believe we've met. I'm Christian. 
 It's okay, Patrice. 
 You and I are leaving. 
 So soon, Johnny? No, come on, buddy. Huh? 
 Stay. 
 Why do you wanna talk to Wolfe, Johnny? 
 I wanna ask him how he feels. 
 Bullshit. 
 What can he possibly tell you now that he couldn't have told you if you'd just broke him out when you had the chance? 
 What are you up to, Johnny? 
 You know, it would be a real shame if my control were to falter and by mischance I teleported away with your hand. 
 Whatever you do, Christian, don't move. 
 Uh... Can I get anything for you, sir? 
 Yeah, yeah, coffee. Strong. 
 Okay. Right away. 
 Wait. Two coffees. One with soy milk to go, please. 
 Right away. 
 There you are. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 It's coffee. 
 I'm familiar with coffee. 
 It's for you. 
 Why? 
 It's got soy milk. Like you like. 
 I like whole milk. 
 But thanks for the effort. 
 You wanna see something cool? 
 Calista Renata-Gene Secor, resident of Las Vegas, Nevada. 
 No sh1t. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Couldn't find any good matches on her with Missing Persons. 
 But taking into account her tendency to run with shitty people, I started looking for a criminal record. 
 That's good cop sh1t. 
 So, partner... 
 Yeah? 
 I wanna talk to Wolfe. 
 You wanna... What the f*ck? 
 I wanna know why Royalle was teleporting in there without getting him out. 
 That's what you wanna talk to him about? 
 Yeah. 
 I... I wanna bust Royalle. 
 Okay. Can I show you some things? 
 Huh? 
 Ah. Wow! 
 We have a Drainer. 
 Hey, Kutter. How's your face? 
 How's your elbow? 
 I've been hit harder by girls. 
 I believe you. 
 Gentlemen. 
 The two Powerz Kidz were flashing their sh1t in public. 
 Sway eyes? 
 Both of 'em. 
 Powers were way over their registered profiles. 
 Really? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Hey. What did they catch you for? 
 I'm as fast as a cheetah. No one can catch me. 
 Smash-and-grabbed a jewelry store, sprinted off at 40 miles per, and tripped. 
 You never would have caught me if my laces hadn't come untied. 
 Double knot 'em next time. 
 Let's peek in on orientation. 
 We get the Drainer, a little good press, suddenly every Metro cop out there wants to be Powers Division. 
 f*cking assholes. 
 Another day with us and they'll know what an asshole really is. 
 New guys, allow me to introduce you to the effects of Sway. 
 The reward for anyone without powers is instant death. 
 Low level Powers like Chromachron and Dem Femmes here use it to boost their abilities. 
 All three kids were on Sway, trying to make a splash. 
 Chromachron used his telekinesis to try to stop a robber's bullet. 
 As you can see, he eventually succeeded. 
 As to what happened to these two, I'm still working that out. 
 But I'd hazard a guess that it was not what they intended. 
 Now, are there any stupid questions? 
 Okay. So, you showed me some things. 
 I wanna bust Royalle as much as you. But Wolfe is evil. 
 Do you believe in evil? 
 Yes, I do. 
 And evil lies. Always. 
 Cops do cop sh1t. Let's do some cop sh1t. 
 You asked for Powers Division, correct? 
 You asked to work with me, why? 
 Because only you can teach me how a Power thinks. 
 I need to talk to Wolfe. 
 Okay. 
 You're not talking to Wolfe. 
 Royalle is gonna get... 
 I don't want anyone talking to Wolfe! 
 I especially don't want Royalle talking to Wolfe. 
 Sooner or later, Royalle's lawyers are gonna get him in there. 
 So, do something to f*ck him up. 
 What? 
 Do something to keep him at bay. 
 We're supposed to be talking about the launch of my foundation. 
 Whose mission is to transform young girls into leaders. 
 Why not bring Zora on as the foundation's first mentor? 
 Zora would love that. 
 We put the two of you out there, looking like a team, talking about sharing your experiences with the next generation. 
 No interviews. Just press release and a photo op. 
 We could do like a riff on the Supershock-Righteous Thunder team-up photos? 
 You know, the two of you in your super suits on top of the... 
 I'm not wearing that ridiculous suit. 
 I'm not starving myself for a week beforehand and dousing myself in baby powder to get the damn thing on. 
 And for what, to stand next to a dewy 20-year-old for a photo op? 
 Are you guys kidding me? 
 There are entire websites dedicated to analyzing and dissecting every single photograph and video of me. 
 Are you aware of that? 
 Um... No. 
 My face and my body are chopped up into separate pieces and they are judged down to the last minute detail. 
 Every line, every wrinkle, every blemish. 
 If I'm tired, I've lost my edge. 
 And if I look good, I've clearly had some work done. 
 Can you imagine what that's like? 
 That would be really shitty. 
 I'm not wearing the suit. I hate that suit. 
 Protesters continue to gather outside the courthouse, awaiting Judge Tanaka's decision. 
 With groups ranging from well-known Civil Rights advocates, to the new youth anti-Powers movement known as Kaotic Chic. 
 Whose videos have been spreading like wildfire across social... 
 You gonna answer him? 
 He obviously cares about you. You should answer him. 
 I'm gonna run my errands. 
 You can give the boy a call. 
 I don't wanna call him. He's a liar. 
 And he has a problem with Powers. 
 Is that why you didn't take the Sway? 
 I just haven't decided yet. 
 Power is absolute, Calista. 
 You either have it, or you don't. 
 I shouldn't have given it to you. 
 I'm not giving it back. 
 It's my choice, Simons. Mine! 
 And I'll make it when I'm f*cking ready. 
 If you're not a Power, you should be. 
 Queen bee arrives. 
 We may have to wait to collect the Sway. 
 To get you to the right agent, please select from the following options. 
 To transfer to billing responsibility... 
 Krisp! Krispin! 
 sh1t. 
 Hey, Craig. 
 You have Zora prepped for Under Armour? 
 We've been playing phone tag, but I will make sure that she's up to speed before the meeting. 
 Phone tag? 
 That is not the tactic you use to land Zora. 
 I'm trying to clear up a few things at home. 
 It's been a little extra tough right now. 
 Candace, with all due respect to your recent loss, Zora needs a manager who is willing to make her the number one priority. 
 I don't know, maybe this isn't a good fit. 
 I'm on it. Okay. I'll see you there. 
 Thanks. 
 My wish for the world... and this will sound insane, I know. 
 But my wish is that the Moon could be a Drainer. 
 A vast orb of green light... 
 Can you turn that thing off, please? 
 I can't concentrate. 
 f*ck off. 
 You are such a dick. 
 f*cking lawyers. 
 Turn that thing off. 
 That's what I told him. 
 And I told you to f*ck off. 
 Can you stop fighting for once? 
 Why the f*ck can't you get along with yourself? 
 He started it. 
 No, he started it. 
 Yeah, well, I'm finishing it. 
 The lawyers figure out how to get you in? 
 We need proof that the Drainer is physically harmful. 
 Are you gonna tell us what's going on? 
 What are you afraid of? 
 Walker pulled his power from Wolfe. 
 What if it's the Sway? 
 What if it filled that hole inside of him? 
 What if it filled that selfish son of a bitch with Wolfe's ability to draw powers? 
 What if I've created another monster? 
 You're supposed to collect the Sway that's out there. 
 I'm doing it right now. 
 Where's the girl? 
 "Where's the girl, where's the girl?" 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 The girl's helping me collect the Sway. 
 You can't stand her. You're always saying, "Get rid of her." 
 Just because I think she's a liability, it doesn't mean I can't like her. 
 What the f*ck does that even mean? 
 I like her. She's sweet. 
 Cops. Walker and Pilgrim. 
 Where? 
 Johnny Royalle, come out to play. 
 Deal with them. 
 What if he tries to absorb my powers? 
 He's not gonna do that. 
 You just said that he might... 
 He's not. 
 He's got a search warrant. He's here to find Sway. Let them in. 
 So, where is he? 
 Well, he's not crouching behind the bar. Take a look. 
 Don't f*ck with me, freak show. 
 Don't touch me. 
 Just tell us where he is. 
 He's in Kuala Lumpur. I think. 
 What's in back? 
 An office. 
 Any more of you creeping around? 
 No. There's only one of me. 
 Oh. 
 You all in there now? 
 I said, don't touch me! 
 Why not, man? 
 You can't have my power! 
 Hey! 
 Hey, I'm just... Hey, come here, man! 
 I'm not kidding. Come here! 
 sh1t! 
 This way! 
 Hey! 
 I got him! 
 Hey! 
 sh1t! 
 Yeah? 
 Okay, pull yourself together! 
 I can't! I can't! 
 Only I can pull us back together. 
 What? 
 f*ck! sh1t! 
 sh1t! 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 You? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey! Get the f*ck out! 
 Get the f*ck out! 
 Come here! Come here! 
 Whoa! 
 Okay, listen up! 
 My partner and I, having been assaulted, have legal grounds to use deadly f*cking force! 
 We do. We do. 
 Now, come out, and get yourself together before I f*cking kill you! 
 I'm going to f*cking kill him. 
 Here we go. Well, here we go. 
 sh1t! 
 Here we go. 
 Here we go. Come on. 
 Hey, get in there. 
 You are under motherfucking arrest. Yeah. 
 Let's go, hon, we're gonna be late. 
 What the hell? 
 I'll be right back. 
 I wanna tell them I'm sorry, about their friends. 
 That's nice. They'll appreciate that. 
 I'm going this way. 
 No, no! No, no, no. 
 Get away from there. 
 Keys! Keys! Where are they? 
 Thank you. 
 No, please. Wait! 
 No! 
 Simons? 
 Not so tough now, huh? 
 Get over it. It ain't like it's killing you. 
 We have a strong commitment to women's stories of power. 
 And your story, the relentless training, your amazing performance at the Shaft, is a perfect reflection of our brand. 
 And of what we strive to help all women achieve, whether they have powers or not. 
 Now, commitment is the cornerstone. 
 But these renderings are just a starting point for our imagination and for yours. 
 They are absolutely thrilled by the idea of designing a new suit. 
 Okay. 
 We love your designs, and we want you to play... 
 What a coincidence, that we both just happen to be here at the same time. 
 ... your dedication, and will inspire every single woman who wears it. 
 Janice! 
 We're so excited to talk to you about the new design. 
 Of course, you already know Zora. 
 We're hoping to convince her to join our Under Armour family. 
 I think she'll make another great role model. 
 I couldn't agree more. 
 Uh, if you don't mind, could Zora and I just have a moment alone? 
 Of course. We're all set up for you in the design studio whenever you're ready. 
 Thank you. 
 In case you haven't figured it out, Craig has paired you up with me to see if you can get a draft. 
 Uh... I don't... I mean, I didn't ask him to. 
 That's why you have an agent. 
 Zora, you know, in time and with rigorous training, you can gain control of your powers. 
 But all of this, the celebrity and the fame, you can't master it. 
 But what fame can do is it creates amazing opportunities to do something lasting. 
 I never asked to take the credit for Wolfe. 
 That was the media. 
 They grabbed onto this story and ran with it. 
 It just got way too big, too fast. 
 I know. I understand. 
 But you haven't done much to correct the situation, have you? 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 I'm doing everything that Craig and Tommy and Candace are telling me to do. 
 Where to go, what to say, who my friends are! I can't even... 
 I knocked down Wolfe. I did that. 
 I never said you didn't. But did you toss him into that cell? 
 Do you remember doing that? Because I certainly didn't do it. 
 Diamond? 
 We both know it didn't happen the way that everybody's saying it happened. 
 And that's the business. 
 And, Zora, this is your moment of opportunity. 
 Please use it to do something real. 
 Oh, God. Look at this. 
 Every time I say, "No onions," they're huge. 
 Is it hurting him? 
 I won't lie. 
 I kind of hope it's hurting him. 
 Guys? 
 Buddy of mine on Metro patrol just sent me this. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Guess we know why he was crying so much. 
 
 
 
 Hey, you said you'd listen. 
 I've had one of the worst days of my life, so just go. 
 I just spent 30 bucks in cab fare, okay? 
 Can I have five minutes? 
 Look, she's just a friend. 
 I don't care if she's just a friend! 
 You betrayed me! 
 Her cousin was killed by a Power, just like my dad was. 
 I had tagged Here and Gone for her. 
 But we tagged the police station together for my dad. 
 And I swear I could only share that with someone I really care about. 
 I really, really care about you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What's her name? 
 I don't know. 
 I only know her handle. 
 It's Kaotic Chic. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 You f*cking asshole! 
 You had me helping you tag a police station with another girl's name? 
 What? No, no. 
 That Kaotic Chic is different, okay. That's a message. 
 It's a message you made out of another girl's name! 
 It's branding, okay? 
 You've got to create the associations. 
 You know, the connections between the words "Kaotic Chic" and the f*cked up sh1t Powers do. 
 Just stop. 
 What? 
 Stop talking. 
 I'm a Power. 
 sh1t. What do you do? 
 My powers haven't manifested yet. 
 So, you don't really have powers. 
 I just told you. I do. 
 I really, really hope, for your sake, that you're wrong, okay. 
 Because I think this world would be better off without Powers. 
 Get out. 
 Calista, please... 
 Get out. 
 You just... 
 I said get out. Just leave! 
 You are so sucked into their bullshit. 
 And you don't even see it! 
 It's like you think you've gotta be a Power to even matter in this world. 
 You don't know anything! You don't anything about me! 
 You don't know anything about my life or whatever... 
 Simons? 
 I said get out! Just leave! 
 f*ck you. 
 My dad was killed by a Power! 
 Krisp, that's not what I... 
 Is everything all right here? 
 No. It doesn't look like it is. 
 Krispin, is it? 
 I think it would best if you leave now. 
 You see, Calista? 
 They think they know what's best for us. 
 This is bullshit. 
 Are you okay? Did he hurt you? 
 No. 
 Where's Simons? God damn it. 
 He's supposed to be keeping an eye on you. 
 He's dead. 
 What do you mean, he's dead? 
 He died, right in front of me. 
 What, here? 
 At The Strip. He just dropped. 
 Where's the Sway? 
 I didn't... I just ran. 
 You did the right thing. 
 The cops are still looking for you. 
 I'll get down to Powers Division. 
 I'm sorry. I don't wanna leave you alone again but I can't take you there. 
 I'll be all right. 
 You'll come back. You always come back. 
 Go take care of your friend, Johnny. 
 That is just weird. 
 Is it a person? 
 I haven't cut into it yet, but judging by its exterior, I surmise that it is filled with blood and guts. 
 So, he was he dealing? 
 Metro talked to some of the Kidz. 
 They said he was taking Sway away from them. 
 What? 
 There was a girl with him, too. 
 Calista? 
 Description matches. 
 I am so hot to bust that brat. 
 You got Royalle's errand boy off the street. Get her, too. 
 Connect him to Olympia once and for all. 
 f*ck him up? 
 Indeed. 
 Asshole alert on aisle 12. 
 I can't hear myself, Johnny. 
 I don't know what this is doing. I feel like it's killing me. 
 I'll get you out. 
 Johnny, no. 
 Listen. The Drainer killed one of him. 
 That machine is dangerous, and we have proof now. 
 He's my friend. 
 If you wanna see Wolfe, this is our legal edge. 
 Get me out. I feel so alone. 
 I'll get you out, but not now. 
 I need you to stay in there. I'm sorry. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Restraining order. 
 Commander Cross, here we are again, addressing the illegalities perpetuated by your division. 
 This inhuman device, and the murderous consequences of its ill-conceived use, are Exhibit A in my renewed application for a humanitarian visit to the prisoner Wolfe. 
 Humanitarian? You're so full of sh1t, man! 
 What are you doing with Wolfe? 
 Stay away from him, Johnny. You can't change the past. 
 You keep trying, and you keep f*cking up. 
 Food for thought. 
 But my legal counsel Ms. Legarde and I have a judge to see. 
 f*ck! 
 Hey, Krispin. 
 You were right. 
 This is our movement. 
 We should do whatever we can to help it grow. 
 And you should be here. 
 I'm really glad you said that. Because, actually, I'm here already. 
 Cool. That's cool. So, we can... 
 We can really make Kaotic Chic into something special, Krispin. 
 Johnny, why don't you come on in? 
 It doesn't hurt. 
 We don't have much time. 
 No, we never seem to have much time when you come visiting. 
 All the many, many times you came visiting. 
 It's taken me a while, but I finally put Humpty together again. 
 What was that thing you kept sticking in my eye? 
 Wolfe, sir. 
 I made something, a drug. 
 A panacea for the weak. 
 Sway. 
 And Walker, he used it. And it... 
 It let him take... 
 It let him take power from me. Yes. 
 What have you done? 
 He thinks he took his own power out of you. 
 He doesn't know he can absorb power, life, from anybody who has used Sway. 
 How many? 
 Too many. 
 What a marvelous invention. 
 That half-dead robot has more understanding of how our powers work than we do. 
 He is really rather clever. 
 But imperfect. 
 It falters sometimes, and when it does, I feel my power. 
 And... 
 And... 
 And something else. 
 Something new. 
 I feel, just beyond my reach, I feel a vast reservoir of power. 
 A flood, waiting for me. 
 Sway. 
 What a wonderful name. 
 And he shall have sway and dominion over all the world. 
 You made a drug out of me, didn't you? 
 You put me into a gaggle of burgeoning powerful youths. 
 And you think Christian is the one you have to worry about? 
 You did not turn Christian into me. 
 I am alone. 
 I am hunger. 
 I am the will to be free. 
 I am a void that must be filled. 
 And you, you've given me a chance to fill that void by not opening my mouth or ruining my clothes. 
 You stupid f*cking idiot. 
 They're gonna drain you. 
 They're gonna drain me? 
 How many children took that Sway? 
 How many of them ate of my blood and body? 
 How many of them will I suck dry? 
 They're gonna drain you forever. 
 Did you not smell the reek of stale whiskey on Triphammer's breath? 
 How long until he breaks, till the machine falters and fails? 
 How long before I can plunge my face into the cool waters and drink my fill? 
 Let me out! 
 Let me out! 
 Royalle's lawyer has the ear of someone on the Federal Powers Detention Board. 
 One of the Simons dying was the wedge she needed to open the door. 
 Okay. 
 Talk to Harley. Let me go in there. 
 We have to know what he wants from Wolfe, why he didn't break him out, why he's been teleporting in there for months. 
 Emile, you have to let me try. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry for your loss. 
 What did you mean when you told Walker he couldn't have your powers? 
 Pilgrim? 
 What? 
 Files you wanted were released from Cook County family court. 
 Should have 'em in your inbox. 
 Uh, thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 The Metro cops that found the dead Simons, did they inventory his Sway? 
 I can find out. 
 Thank you. 
 Let me know if their count matched ours. 
 You got it. 
 Today, I am rich in friends. 
 I'm not your friend. 
 No. You are so much more than that. 
 Royalle's not your friend either. 
 But he's done so much for me. 
 If he was your friend, he would have gotten you out. 
 Johnny is concerned more with the noumenal elements of myself rather than my freedom. 
 I don't know what that means. 
 Johnny is worried about my soul, I think. 
 He wants to purify me of my sins. Some bullshit like that. 
 What do you want? 
 Yes. We both know what you want. 
 For myself, I want to be out of here. 
 I want my 20 years of torture to be at an end. 
 Drained or not, they'll never let you go. 
 Don't be an asshole. I don't want to be drained. 
 Then, why did you ask? 
 Come on, Christian, you don't want me to be drained any more than I do. 
 That's why you came here, isn't it? 
 So I could tell you what happened between us? 
 There's no question. 
 You took back your powers from me. 
 Didn't it feel good? 
 It did for me. 
 Don't you wanna feel like that again? 
 I do. 
 You can. 
 I do. 
 You can have them all. 
 All you have to do is to switch out the light. 
 Before they use it to take your powers out of me forever. 
 Can I come in? 
 Calista? 
 Johnny? 
 I'm right here. 
 Am I still alive? 
 Yes. 
 You're still alive. 
 I was so afraid that... 
 That I didn't belong... 
 That I wasn't a Power. 
 But I am. 
 I must be. Right? 
 Judge Tanaka has agreed to Wolfe's request to be permanently drained, and the Federal Powers Detention Board has scheduled the draining to take place in just one week. 
 Thank you, Delia. 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 Needless to say, emotions are running very high today. 
 But I think we can all agree the world will be a safer place... 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 You okay? 
 I have no idea how I am. 
 What are you doing? 
 Eating ice cream. 
 Butter pecan? 
 Yes. 
 Remember that stand we used to go to in the park? 
 That is exactly where I am. 
 Really? Are you getting away with it? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 So far. 
 How's it feel? 
 I like it. 
 Maybe a little too much. 
 I could just walk away from all of it, you know? 
 Ah... 
 You wouldn't last a week. 
 Do not underestimate me. 
 I'm not. 
 Something would happen. Car accident, fire... 
 And you would just be you in all your inescapable glory. 
 As long as you still had your powers, you wouldn't be able to stop yourself, trust me. 
 What about your powers? 
 I went to see Wolfe. 
 Okay. What was that like? 
 He f*cked with my head. Like he always did. 
 Thinks he knows what I want better than I do. 
 What do you want, Christian? 
 I wanna be great, Janice. 
 You know, I really think I could be great. 
 If I had another chance. I just... 
 I don't know how to get 'em back. 
 I used to think that in every situation, there was a good choice or a bad choice. 
 But sometimes, Christian, there's just a shitty choice and an unacceptable choice. 
 And only you know which one is which. 
 Oh, God. I just got spotted. I'll call you later. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 He's not gonna hurt you. 
 Not gonna hurt anyone. 
 I'll figure it out. 
 Oh, Jesus. Johnny, what did you do to her? 
 She's okay. 
 She took Sway, Christian. But she's okay. 
 What the f*ck, man? 
 Hey! Is she gonna die? 
 No, she's not. 
 Hey, Calista. Look at me, it's Diamond. 
 What the f*ck have you done, man? 
 Don't you disappear on me. You hear me?
