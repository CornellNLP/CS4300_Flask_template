 Previously on Powers... 
 Coming up at the top of the hour, the funeral of the century, the funeral for Retro Girl. 
 You didn't have an appointment with her the day she was murdered? 
 No. 
 You didn't bother... to check up on her... 
 Christian, she... 
 Like a good agent? 
 She was my friend. 
 I know you know something, you little weasel. 
 Mystery Man's got to see how committed we are, especially after what we did. 
 I was able to track the MAC address to a laptop... 
 Marigold Wygant. 
 If she logs on again... 
 I'll call you. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Funny... that's what Mama said every time you threw her against the door. 
 Anything could happen, so be prepared. 
 Gang fights, riots, looting... 
 I'm here to help. 
 I feel better. 
 We could use SuperShock now. 
 SuperShock... 
 It's nice to see you again. 
 Good outfit. 
 You okay? We should get out of here. 
 Do you want to get off me? 
 Did you see SuperShock? 
 The girl's online. 
 Hey! 
 This isn't what you think. 
 That you killed Retro Girl and Krispin. 
 No, he's gonna kill me. Please. 
 We need to go. He's here. 
 You're not going anywhere until you tell me who. 
 Over here! We got something! 
 Help! 
 There's something else here! 
 Can't believe I sent Walker here after that bitch. 
 You didn't cause this, Harley. 
 SuperShock should be helping us dig. 
 We don't need him. 
 Then arrest the son of a bitch, Emile. 
 We're talking manslaughter, at least. 
 We're not finding him, Commander. 
 Deena... 
 We're not finding sh1t. 
 We're not done looking. 
 Nobody is giving up, Deena. 
 Walker's under that? 
 What was he doing here? 
 His job. What are you doing here? 
 This wasn't a hot spot last night. 
 I'm calling in a team. 
 We got this. 
 Listen... 
 Agent Lange, we both know your bureau has no reason to be here. 
 Hey, guys, I think I got something! 
 Over here! 
 Over here! 
 Where? Right here? 
 Okay. 
 Looks like a woman. 
 Part of a woman. 
 Wait. 
 Is that her laptop? 
 Who is she? 
 This has nothing to do with you or your people. 
 As in, back the f*ck off. 
 Wait, wait, wait! 
 Got another one. 
 Something's under here. 
 Schlag. 
 Come on, boys! 
 Is someone in there? 
 Pulse shaky. 
 Pupils dilated and unequal, possible cranial trauma. 
 He's alive? 
 He's breathing. 
 Better f*ckin' be. 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 Go. 
 There we go. 
 Thank you for the ride, mister. 
 My pleasure. 
 So... 
 Remind me next time I get invited to one of those things... 
 The food is awful. 
 The people are worse. 
 And shilling for corporate assholes crushes the soul. 
 But the dancing wasn't bad. 
 And here I thought you hated dancing. 
 Apparently not with you. 
 That's because I lead. 
 Because I let you lead. 
 You don't let Janice? 
 I would, if she danced. 
 Surprised she didn't come. 
 It's pretty much the Retro Girl show, anyway. 
 She doesn't go in for the toy crap, and she doesn't get along with Moody. 
 Conrad Amadeus Moody, III. 
 He's bizarre... but harmless. 
 I can't complain about the paycheck I get from him, just for being me. 
 No? 
 Thirsty? 
 I think we're both already in the bag, don't you? 
 Not anymore. 
 Oh, these are adorable. 
 To a successful Christmas season. 
 May my action figure outsell yours by a hefty margin. 
 Those hefty plastic breasts would probably do the trick. 
 They better. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, there she is. 
 They did a good job with her. 
 Even her eyebrows look heroic. 
 Wait. 
 Why? 
 I don't know if we should. 
 Liar. 
 Your system's flushed with oxytocin. 
 You reek for me. 
 This is gonna end in tears, isn't it? 
 Everything does. 
 How is he doing? 
 Nothing's changed. 
 Doctors are keeping him sedated. 
 What do you want? 
 I want you to eat. 
 Oh, Jesus... 
 You can't blame yourself. 
 I blame us... actually. 
 Stop it. 
 Digging my nails in your back when I was supposed to be watching his. 
 He took off, Deena. 
 What were you supposed to do? 
 I... I don't know. 
 f*ck a colleague? 
 No, wait, I think I was supposed to find out where he went and back him up. 
 Then you'd both be under a building. 
 Go back to work, Kutter. 
 That the very same people who tell you Senator Bailey Brown's initiative is anti-constitutional are the ones who support the unregulated vigilantism running rampant in our streets. 
 Hypocritical? 
 Senator Brown thinks so too. 
 So remember to tell your representatives to vote for the Brown... 
 Okay, who had the... 
 Some kind of omelet? 
 I think that's me. 
 Hey... I had one. 
 Omelet over here! 
 Ham and cheese omelet? 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 It's okay, honey. I got it. 
 First day on the job, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 He came from the sky like that proverbial bolt from the blue. 
 Gone for decades but returning last night. 
 SuperShock. 
 SuperShock, back to put an end to Hell Night and the destruction threatening to tear our city apart. 
 At his side, someone we first took as a pretenderto the throne... 
 The young woman we are now calling the new Retro Girl. 
 Order's up! 
 Clearly she has... 
 ...extraordinary mettle if SuperShock has come out of seclusion to endorse her. 
 All of which begs the million dollar question... 
 Calista, order's up! 
 Are we looking at the beginning of a new Unity? 
 Holy sh1t. 
 This morning the entire world is dying to know more about the new Retro Girl. 
 We at PTB ask that anyone who can shed light on this mystery step forward, be heard, and, of course, compensated. 
 So, how is it going? 
 You got a positive ID? 
 Working on it. 
 There's something else I want you to see. 
 Look. 
 It's spinning backwards. 
 Yes, exactly. 
 The hands of time pointing to our true cause of death. 
 So, you're saying it wasn't the collapse that killed her? 
 No, the falling building killed her. 
 What we need is a bird's-eye view of the crime scene. 
 Why? What are we looking for? 
 Something I haven't seen in a very long time. 
 I swear, if you don't stop with this cryptic sh1t, I'm gonna take that arm and beat you with the bloody end of it. 
 Gravity waves. 
 Oh, this really is beautiful. 
 Yeah, Brian... kept offering me the keys, and I figured I... should try it out. 
 And you thought of me? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 I've missed you. 
 It's been a long time, and... 
 A lot has changed. 
 Sure has, yeah. 
 So, how is it working for cops? 
 Yeah, yeah, fine. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 You were never one to take orders. 
 It's... 
 You know, same job, just add paperwork. 
 And take away flying. 
 sh1t, yeah. 
 I miss flying. 
 God, I miss flying. 
 It's so different now, you know? 
 I get colds and, like, flu. 
 I cut myself shaving. 
 I... almost broke my ankle on a damn curb. 
 I feel like a walking mess. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You don't feel so different. 
 You're no different. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Are you okay? 
 Why wouldn't I be? 
 Is there anything you want to tell me or... 
 We're not alone. 
 Walker! 
 You using the place? 
 Who is this? 
 Hey, Brian. 
 Oh, my partner. 
 Are you... are you up here this weekend? 
 I thought... 
 Sorry, man. 
 Must have had our wires crossed. 
 Yeah... it's okay. 
 We can work something out. 
 He... he told me he wasn't gonna be here. 
 I just realized something. 
 You have me backed up against the water. 
 And I hate water. 
 So, no... 
 ...weekend getaway... 
 ...huh, Christian? 
 I need you to turn around, put your hands behind your back. 
 Just the two of you? 
 Angela Lange, also known as Lynx, you are under arrest for the theft and illegal sale of over $14 million dollars of impounded contraband and the murder of four DEA agents. 
 You think they were clean? 
 If you resist, we will open fire. 
 You'll be dead before they tag me, Captain Cross. 
 Just as long as we tag you. 
 Don't do it. 
 Don't make it worse. 
 She can't help but make it worse, Walker. 
 None of them can. 
 You know they're gonna kill us all. 
 They're the end of the goddamn world. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Deena. 
 What... where is Marigold? 
 She's dead. She's dead. 
 A building fell on her, and it fell on you, and you... you should be dead. 
 What? No. I'm... I'm fine. 
 I've... I'm... I'm... 
 You're fine. 
 Did you sleep here? 
 Not too much. 
 How we doing? 
 Readings are good. 
 Looks like your sprint alignment is balancing out. 
 You know, I've been thinking... I'm gonna need a name, aren't I? 
 You got a problem with Martinez? 
 Come on, you know what I mean. 
 I'm not here just so you can pimp my ride or to help you around the house. 
 It's time to get back to sh1t that matters. 
 Yeah, Special Forces certainly doesn't make a habit of putting gimps back in the action. 
 No, they sure as hell don't. 
 Now, first, let's run the bugs out of the system. 
 Then we can talk about naming your boy band. 
 All right, give me another 10 minutes of full speed there, Menudo. 
 Ten minutes, sir! 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Hey, the FBI is outside. 
 Well, that's why your cell phones won't work. 
 I'm jamming the hell out of them. 
 How's Walker? 
 Stable but still out, as far as I know. 
 Say hello to Sergeant Martinez. 
 Not a Power? 
 Just a vet with skills. 
 You know, we guys got to stick together. 
 How's the hard drive? 
 I'm still churning it. 
 But the girl was onto something. 
 With her encryption and the damage to the hard drive, it's hard to know what. 
 You get anything yet? 
 Marigold Wygant. Still checking. 
 Anything you can do to stop the Feds from cramping my style? 
 They're cramping everybody, Harley. 
 Might have something to do... with this. 
 No. sh1t. 
 What do you see? 
 A f*cking nightmare. 
 Well, look outside of the nightmare. 
 Rings. 
 Yeah. 
 Concentric rings. 
 This is not fallout from SuperShock. 
 Some other Power did this? 
 Well, you tell me. 
 If it's a Power, it's not registered in the database. 
 f*ck. That's it. 
 That's it. 
 What? 
 The hard drive has been damaged, like I said, like some kind of waves passing through it. 
 And it... it made for a pattern of code dropout that I haven't been able to correct for. 
 It's rings, like ripples in a pond, like... 
 Gravity waves. 
 Absolutely a Power. 
 A gravity guy. 
 Serious bogey. 
 Level Seven at least. Maybe higher. 
 That's what I was afraid of. 
 But the Powers database is coming up empty, so I thought we could run it through your database. 
 The one you're not legally allowed to possess. 
 The Black Swan files. 
 Hey, what is with your phones? 
 They're jammed. 
 What's going on? 
 Well, you've got FBI parked out there. 
 We know. 
 The f*ck is that? 
 What's up? 
 Walker. He's up. 
 He's awake. 
 Only Walker could have... a ten-story building fall on top of him... 
 
 
 
 Trip! 
 I tried to call. 
 Did he say anything? 
 Hey! Trip! 
 Anything at all? 
 Hey, we got comps to approve for that whole memorial box reissue thing. 
 Oh, Jesus. God... Just... ask Phil. 
 Phil said ask you. 
 We need them by 5:00. 
 Why? 
 We already ate this one. 
 Ate her all up. 
 Now we... 
 ...want the new one. 
 Got to have the new girl, don't we? 
 We got to have the new flavor. 
 Gonna... gonna eat her too. 
 Craig? 
 Craig? Are you okay? 
 These are great. 
 These are f*cking great! 
 I love them. 
 Oh, they are fantastic. 
 Tell Phil. 
 Tell everybody! 
 Good job! 
 Yeah! P.A.R.! 
 f*ck! 
 f*ck me. 
 I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to call you folks. 
 You know, 'cause I'm not doing this for myself. 
 I just feel, there are some things about Retro Girl that the world ought to know. 
 Well, the photos are convincing. 
 I think it could be her. 
 Oh, it's her. 
 That's Calista. 
 My Calista. 
 She's a Power, all right. 
 But... 
 She isn't right in the head. 
 Never has been. 
 And now, well... 
 ...you know. 
 You can see the potential for danger, right? 
 I honestly don't know if she's ever gonna come back to finish the job, so... 
 Mr. Secor, can you give us anything that would help track her down? 
 I have her social, if that'll help. 
 Social security number? 
 Yeah. 
 That... that would be great. 
 Good God. Right in your lap. 
 Mother of f*ck. 
 Call Pelham. Call business and legal. 
 Let's paper this guy up. 
 We got to own him before we move on this. 
 I'm on it, Nicole. 
 Mother of f*ck. 
 I think I got something for you. 
 Okay. 
 How did it come down? 
 They're called "Lifters." 
 They break the laws of gravity. 
 Seriously? 
 Says the guy who could fly. 
 Lifters are very rare. 
 Two in the last 50 years. 
 And he was one of them. Look familiar? 
 No. 
 His name is Derek Warner. 
 And where is Mr. Warner now? 
 Unknown. 
 He goes by the name "Heavy." 
 Well, we know Heavy killed Marigold, so I'm putting him down for Krispin as well. 
 Why? 
 Because he's framing him for Janice's murder. 
 He needs to make it stick, so he put a bomb in a car and blew him up. 
 Nah, there isn't even circumstantial evidence to support this claim, it's pure conjecture. 
 Before the roof fell in, Marigold said, "He's here. We have to go." 
 She was terrified, and she wanted help. 
 You think he killed Retro Girl? 
 Did you recover Marigold's computer? 
 We did. 
 But it was destroyed. 
 Except for the hard drive. 
 You got the data? 
 Christian... She had hacked her way into quite a few places, including P.A.R.'s roster of Powers clients. 
 She had Janice's shoe size, appearance fees, talk show green room requirements. 
 She was connecting the dots. 
 And the last thing she did before she was killed was try to hack into an FBI computer. 
 A server? 
 A laptop. 
 Lange's. 
 Okay. 
 Easy does it. 
 I'm fine. 
 I need to reconnect with Lange. 
 I need to do it alone. 
 And you and Kutter need to be there. 
 Hey there. 
 Have you been helped? 
 Actually, I think I might be able to help you. 
 Could I get a cup of coffee, please? Decaf. 
 I know your company. 
 You guys represent Powers. 
 I represented Retro Girl. 
 That's why I'm here. 
 What? 
 We don't have... much time, Calista. 
 I... I want you to know that I believe in everything that you're doing. 
 I... I believe in you. 
 Me? But I'm not... 
 You are her. 
 You're the next... 
 ...her. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 What I'm talking about is, I want to help you handle all of this. 
 "All of this." 
 Yeah. 
 All... this. 
 Excuse me. I'm Nicole Glantz from PTB TV. 
 You're Calista Secor. You're the new Retro Girl. 
 Let me get in here. 
 Ms. Secor, talk to me. 
 You have a chance to make this right. 
 Get away from me! 
 Excuse me. 
 I think she said not to film her. 
 Your father has alleged that you abducted... 
 ...and assaulted him... 
 Get away from me! 
 Don't let 'em get to you... 
 Get away! 
 They just want to get a rise out of you. 
 f*ck you! 
 We can help you... 
 Stop. 
 f*ck you! 
 You're fired! 
 f*ck you! 
 He eats like a wood chipper. 
 If I had a nickel... 
 They said you pulled me out. 
 Thank you, Schlag. 
 Please, continue. Don't let me interrupt you. 
 But... 
 Could I... Could I interrupt you? 
 I saw them pull you out of that trash compactor, you know? 
 Christ, Walker, you should be dead. 
 That has crossed my mind. 
 What were you doing in that building? 
 Tracking an associate of Krispin's. 
 And that was her? Marigold Wygant? 
 Yeah. She... 
 I don't believe I mentioned her name. 
 You know, it would have been nice if you'd shared some of your information with me. 
 So that's what this is? 
 You want me to just help you out... 
 No. 
 ...because we're such great friends. 
 No, no, no. 
 I didn't... I didn't come to talk about the investigation. I... 
 Angela... 
 What? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I never told you that. 
 I never told you how hard it was for me to bring you in at the lake house. 
 That's ancient history. 
 Just like us. 
 I didn't want to do it. 
 I had to. I... 
 It's okay, Walker. 
 Worked out for the best, right? 
 The Feds recruited me out of that shithole prison, and now I'm a rehabilitated benefit to my country. 
 Hell, I think I even outrank you now. 
 Technically. 
 Yeah. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 You know I didn't come here to f*ck with you, right? 
 If it was up to me, I'd share what I had. 
 Okay. 
 Share something now. 
 Okay. 
 I'm glad you weren't crushed. 
 About her? 
 I know what you know. 
 A misguided misfit with a persecution complex. 
 Nothing but a poor, messed-up kid. 
 You know the type? 
 I do. 
 We never had a chance, did we? 
 Blame it on timing and your criminal activities. 
 Yeah... 
 Those. 
 Okay. 
 If I tell you something, you promise to keep it a secret? 
 Sure. 
 I'm still bad. 
 This is gonna take a minute. 
 More than that. 
 Is it okay? 
 It's okay. Just a fracture. 
 Come here. 
 That's the cue. Jesus... 
 So, you think Triphammer's hockey puck will work? 
 I don't know. 
 Watch my back. 
 Oh, I'm on it. 
 No, I'm... 
 I'm here. I'm on it. 
 I want to be on it. 
 Shut the f*ck up. 
 Jesus. 
 Hard. 
 Oh, yeah, I remember. 
 Hard. 
 I'm trying. 
 Harder! 
 I'm trying, God damn it! 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 f*ck! 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 That's good. 
 Yeah, that's good. 
 f*ck! 
 No biting! 
 sh1t. 
 f*ck. 
 f*ck. 
 f*ck. 
 Bad kitty. Bad kitty. 
 You bad kitty. 
 Okay... 
 Your sweat... 
 It doesn't lie. 
 What? 
 Trust me, I know heat. 
 And yours isn't honest. 
 What's going on, Christian? 
 Angela... 
 Okay. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Freeze, pussy! 
 No. 
 No! Get off him! 
 We know about Heavy. 
 We know about Heavy. 
 Heavy what? 
 Derek. Derek Warner. 
 I have no idea what the f*ck you're talking about. 
 SuperShock didn't bring down that building. 
 A Lifter did. 
 A Lifter? 
 Yeah, he's one of yours? Right? 
 You came here to f*cking steal from me! 
 Angela, the people that you work for, they're evil, okay? 
 They saved my life. 
 No, they took it over. 
 They're using you. 
 Pizza's done. 
 Come with us. 
 You have a choice. 
 Work with us and we can find out what's going on. 
 And if I don't... 
 They're gonna... 
 They're gonna... f*cking shoot me? 
 Well, you know my vote. 
 Okay. Walker, we got it. 
 Let's go. 
 Get out. 
 Okay. 
 Ms. Secor, talk to me. 
 You have a chance to make things right here. 
 Get away from me! 
 Excuse me, I think she said she didn't want to be filmed. 
 Your father has alleged that you abducted and assaulted him... 
 Get away from me! 
 How the f*ck do you do it? 
 Get away! 
 You don't want to know. 
 What do you want to do now? 
 How about you talk to me? 
 Heavy was a deep cover black ops agent working for the government, then he quit. 
 Vanished. 
 Feds have been hunting him ever since. 
 And now he's here. 
 He killed Retro Girl. 
 For who? On whose orders? 
 Unknown. 
 He framed Krispin and the girl for the fall. 
 Classic fieldcraft. 
 Oh, that's spy-speak for... 
 I know what it means. 
 He played Kaotic Chic, he played the Hacks, and he played all of us. 
 Why kill Retro Girl? 
 I don't know. 
 But this is bigger than we imagined. 
 How big? 
 Move, move, move, move! 
 On the floor! 
 On the floor! 
 Everybody down! 
 Get down! 
 Arms up! 
 Put it down! 
 What's going on? 
 Drop your weapons! 
 Drop your weapons, now! 
 What the f*ck, man? 
 Officers of the Powers Division, this precinct is now under federal control. 
 Oh, Jesus... 
 This really how you want to play it, Angela? 
 It's the only hand I've got. 
 Officers, we need your weapons on the ground now! 
 Emile? 
 If you resist... we will open fire. 
 Division, stand down. 
 Put it down. 
 Give me your weapons. 
 Please, resist. 
 By order of the President of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation hereby dissolves this division and requisitions all assets, materials, equipment, and personnel affiliated with this... 
 Jesus, enough. 
 Not quite. 
 The meteors are coming! 
 The meteors are coming! 
 I'm Retro Girl, and I can help! 
 But, oh, no, there's one left. Super giant king meteor! 
 And it's coming straight for the city. 
 What are they gonna do? 
 Diamond! 
 Help me push it back! 
 Here comes Diamond! 
 And SuperShock! 
 And Retro Girl! 
 And they're working together to push the meteor back! 
 But is it enough? I don't know! 
 He's so amazing with them. 
 It's like he never lost that spark, you know? 
 Into outer space! Yay, the world is saved! 
 He seems to really like toys. 
 He loves toys. 
 Hello, Craig. 
 Thank you so much for coming. 
 Mr. Moody. 
 Please, I've told you, it's Conrad. 
 And you... you must be Calista. 
 May I call you Calista? 
 Sure. 
 Oh, excellent. 
 Let me look at you. 
 Oh, you are so symmetrical. 
 Oh, it's just perfect. 
 You're beautiful. She's beautiful. 
 Has Craig told you how much I want you? 
 He's told me you're a big fan. 
 I am. 
 Come with me, please. 
 Kids, we have our new Retro Girl! 
 Yes! Yes! 
 Yay!
