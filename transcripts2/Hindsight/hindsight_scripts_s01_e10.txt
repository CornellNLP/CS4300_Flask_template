 Becca : Previously on Hindsight... 
 Lolly : Ever since your little elevator ride, you've been too scared to make any tough decisions. 
 I can't. 
 Give me my ring back. 
 I need you. 
 This can never work. 
 Why do you care who I date? 
 Because I like you. 
 So you'll give me another chance? 
 Unless you have other plans. 
 It's us. 
 You should be with Melanie, Andy. 
 I thought we were starting something. 
 Will you marry me? 
 Yeah. 
 Andy : I can't talk to you, Becca. 
 It's not good for me being around you. 
 Promise me you'll watch it with the booze. 
 We're not together anymore. 
 You will find happiness once you tell him that you want to be more than friends. 
 Lolly : He really doesn't like me back. 
 There's something I have to tell you. 
 What are we doing here, Becca? 
 This friendship, it's over. 
 Lolly. 
 Maybe none of this is predestined. 
 Well, I guess we'll find out. 
 What's going on with you and Kevin? 
 Ever since I met you, I haven't been able to stop thinking about you. 
 Lolly : Becca. 
 Becca. 
 You shouldn't have done that. 
 Lolly. 
 Lolly. 
 Lolly. 
 Lolly, wait. 
 Lolly, this is not what it looks like. 
 Tell me, Becca, what do you think it looks like? 
 Where are you going? 
 Anywhere but here. 
 No. 
 No, Lolly, don't go, not in the middle of the night. 
 I will go any way that I want to. 
 Now you guys can have the apartment to yourselves, you know, have a party. 
 You don't have to sneak out onto the roof. 
 Lolly. Lolly. 
 Don't you dare follow me. 
 Lolly. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Don't touch me. 
 Oh, my God. 
 This is not happening. 
 I should leave. 
 Yeah, you should. 
 Oh, my God.

 Melanie. 
 I heard you were staying in town for Christmas. 
 Yeah, my parents are in Bermuda. 
 I made too many white chocolate reindeer drops. 
 Thank you. 
 Where's Lolly? 
 I don't know. 
 Listen, Becca. 
 The real reason I'm here is, I want to make sure you're coming to our engagement party. 
 The Kellys would really like to have all their closest friends and family there, and since I'm going to be a Kelly soon, I just don't want to be the cause of any rift between the two families. 
 So can I count on you to be there? 
 Yeah, invitation is right there. 
 Well, ta-ta for now.

 I'm here in broad daylight. 
 Things are just really complicated for me right now. 
 Of course. 
 No more showing up drunk at 2:00 a.m. on your doorstep. 
 Well, are you gonna show me new stuff or what? 
 Mm. 
 Oh, did I tell you I'm curating a 30 Under 30 show? 
 No, you didn't. 
 Yeah, there's a preview reception at Jones court in a few days. 
 I would love to have a few of your pieces. 
 If you're interested... And under 30. 
 I'm both. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Don't answer that. 
 Oar And Anchor, it's Paige. 
 Hey, Paige, it's Sean. 
 If that's Mel, I'm not here. 
 I went to Reno. 
 Sean? 
 Sean : You won't believe what's just happened. 
 I've been invited to show my work at a 30 Under 30 show. 
 Oh, my God, Sean. That's amazing. 
 The opening is in a few days. Would you come? 
 Paige : Absolutely. 
 Phone's not for personal calls. 
 Ugh, I'll call you later. 
 I've got to run to my audition. 
 Congratulations, though. 
 I don't remember inviting you. 
 Vampires have to be invited in. 
 You fail to realize I'm not technically inside. 
 And you fail to realize you've picked the wrong week to mess with the wrong... Um, God, sorry. 
 I really wanted to nail this. 
 Okay, can I go again? 
 Stanton : I've just got to get a few things before we leave for St. Barts. 
 Travel bong. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. 
 I'm dreaming of a... [Sniffs] 
 White Christmas. 
 Ho, ho, no. 
 Oh, no, dude. 
 Jamie : What the hell happened? 
 Oh, God. 
 Dude, the money. 
 The money, man. 
 Okay, how much did we have? 
 I mean, thousands, man, thousands. 
 It's gone, man. It's... it's gone. 
 Stanton : Why did you leave it here, you dunce? 
 Jamie : So I'd know where to find it. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, hold on, hold on. All right, hold on. 
 Oh, man, man. Oh, no. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. 
 The prescription pad is gone too, man. 
 Stanton : Okay, okay, we've just got to lift another one. 
 No, man. You don't get it. 
 It's out there. It's out in the world.

 This year, my mom sent me a... A sweater and some gloves. 
 And my dad... this is great. 
 My dad said he'd buy me a drink when he sees me. 
 Ooh, that's nice. 
 Pretty cool. 
 I also got a sweater and some fairly ugly earrings. 
 Fairly ugly? 
 [Laughs] 
 [Laughs] 
 I just want to... 
 Look, Becca... 
 [Laughs] 
 Yeah, sorry. 
 You go. 
 No, you first. 
 No, you go. 
 I insist. 
 You go. 
 Okay. 
 I don't know exactly how to describe it. 
 I feel like you know me better than anyone else in the world [Laughs] I just want to know if you feel the same. 
 Ugh. 
 Kevin, we... We cannot be together. 
 It will destroy my friendship with Lolly. 
 Just because I want something doesn't mean I can have it. 
 I mean, there are consequences to our actions that we just... 
 We don't know about yet. 
 But you think we couldn't just see where this goes. 
 We wouldn't have to say anything to her. 
 I mean, not right away, not until we're sure. 
 I am sure.

 Bye. 
 Lolly, I lied to you. 
 Lolly... Lolly. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I lied to you about Kevin. 
 [Sighs] 
 I lied to you about Kevin. 
 I'm a really bad friend. 
 I never told you the whole truth about Kevin. 
 [Door slams shut] 
 Lolly : Hello. 
 Hey, did you get my messages? 
 Where were you? 
 I was at my dad's. It was great, actually. 
 I think he must be on Valium or something, because we was just so open. 
 I mean, we really talked. 
 How was your holiday? 
 Good. 
 It was quiet. 
 I missed you. 
 Hey, are we good? 
 I overreacted. 
 I was just... I was... I was surprised. 
 But I've had a few days to think about it, and I realized I'm gonna be so mad at myself if I stood in the way of you being with Kevin. 
 No, Lolly, I'm not gonna... 
 No, Becca, listen. 
 The bottom line is, he doesn't like me. 
 I mean, yeah, of course he likes me, but, you know, not like that. 
 No, no, absolutely not. 
 I am not gonna go out with Kevin. 
 Becca, look, I'm giving you a chance right now to be totally honest with me, no judgment. 
 Do you have feelings for him? 
 No. 
 No, and I would never do anything to hurt you. 
 All right, frankly, I'm offended you'd think I'd be that fragile. 
 You know, I'll find a new guy on New Year's Eve. 
 That's like shooting fish in a barrel. 
 Oh, and I thought of our New Year's resolution. 
 We are quitting smoking. 
 My dad's gonna pay us. 
 I'm in. 
 What's that, boxing day present for me? 
 An engagement present for Andy and Melanie. 
 Oh. 
 I found them this commemorative plate of John Steinbeck stamps he's always wanted. 
 Wow, that really sounds like a gift for Andy and Melanie. 
 Well, like they need another vase. 
 Lolly : Becca, you have to unlearn everything you know about him. 
 He's with someone else now. 
 What are you gonna wear, my Christmas sweater? 
 That? Not that.

 Oh, hey, thank you. 
 Hi. 
 Hi, Mom. 
 You look tired. 
 Thanks. 
 You need to stop frowning. 
 You'll get an 11 between your eyes, and there's nothing you can do about it. 
 Oh, yeah, until Botox. 
 What? 
 Huh? 
 Georgie : Do you think they're pregnant? 
 What? 
 I mean, why else would they be getting married so young? 
 You were smart not to marry Sean. 
 I can see that now. 
 What? 
 Do you remember the day that we took a walk in the park right after you called off the wedding? 
 I've been thinking about something you said about starting over, how it's never too late. 
 It's just... 
 Are you... 
 We don't have to talk about this now. 
 [Silently] Thank you. 
 Congrats on the article. 
 Hey. 
 I thought it was great. 
 You read it? 
 Don't look so surprised. 
 I can read. 
 [Laughs] 
 Look, I'm sorry about what I said at Thanksgiving. 
 You know, I didn't mean that we could never talk again. 
 I don't know; I just... I just needed to... 
 Clear your head? 
 Clear my head, yeah. 
 [Laughs] No, it's okay. I'm happy for you guys. 
 You guys belong together. 
 Here, this is for you. 
 Oh. 
 It's nothing. 
 I'm sure it's not nothing. 
 No, it's... it's nothing. 
 Oh, no, I didn't... 
 Okay. 
 Oh, hey, wait. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Just with everything that's happened, I guess this has to be a little hard. 
 A little. 
 Yeah. 
 But I'm good. 
 They're happy. 
 Are you okay? 
 Never better. 
 Really? 'Cause... 
 Roger. Excuse me. 
 Okay. 
 Oh. 
 [Knock at door] 
 Jamie. 
 Becca. 
 Becca. 
 Come on in. 
 Where's Becca? Where's my sister? 
 She's at Andy and Melanie's engagement party. 
 [Groans] 
 What's with you? 
 I lost something that didn't belong to me in the first place, and now I have no way of getting it back. 
 Anything to do with the roll of bills that I found in your pocket after our holiday party? 
 No. No, that was nothing. 
 I won that playing Blackjack in the D.R. 
 She's not here. I've got to go. 
 No. No, wait, Jamie. 
 Stay. Just stay. 
 Lolly, you were just leaving. 
 I can stay. I'll stay. 
 Look, let's hang out. I can call in sick. 
 Stop. 
 Do it all the time. 
 Stop. Stop! Stop! 
 What? 
 Stop pitying me. 
 I'm not. 
 Yes, you are. 
 Whatever it is you lost, maybe I can help you find it if you just... if you let me. 
 Lolly, you cannot help me right now. 
 You can't help me. 
 I don't know what you did, but whatever it is, you have to admit to it, and you have to stop it before it gets worse. 
 That's great. 
 Thank you for that wonderful advice. 
 You've been a real pal. 
 Damn it. 
 [Tape rewinder whirring] 
 Uh, you okay? 
 Honestly, I'm worried about Jamie. 
 Oh, what's going on? Can I help? 
 I thought he got his life together, you know? 
 He seemed so good. 
 Then he came to our apartment earlier, and he was a mess, and not even drunk or high. 
 Just, like, falling apart. 
 And it's especially disconcerting, because I knew that he had this in him. 
 It's completely my fault. 
 Oh, it's not your fault. 
 I mean, whatever he's going through, he's the architect of that. 
 [Sighs] 
 Look, Jamie's my homey. 
 I'm concerned too. 
 Oh, God. Oh, my God. 
 Hey, can I talk to you. 
 Lolly is extremely busy right now. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Mess you up. 
 Hey, look, I feel really bad about what happened. 
 Oh, God, please, it's fine. 
 Kevin : It's... no, no, it's not fine. 
 Look, I want to make this right. 
 How can I make this right with us? 
 I wish you just would have told me you were into her. 
 Look, it doesn't matter now. 
 It's off the table. 
 Aside from the fact that she's not interested, I just... 
 Yeah, but what if she were? 
 Lolly, she loves you. 
 I've never met anyone who is a more loyal friend. 
 That's true. 
 So can we hang out sometime? 
 Fine. I'd like that. 
 Oh, my God, Jamie, you're here. 
 Hey. 
 Thank God. I didn't know you were coming. 
 You okay? 
 Not really, no. 
 I... I really came because I just need to talk to dad. 
 About what? 
 Hey, about take a cue from everything that's happened since you called off your wedding and stay out of it? 
 Lincoln : Jamie, we need to talk.

 Jamie... 
 Dad, I... 
 No, there's something I need to tell you. 
 I am proud of you. 
 Ahh. 
 You know, these past few weeks you have really pulled yourself together. 
 I mean, I know we've butted heads of over school and the money, but maybe that was the kick in the pants that you needed, because look at you now. 
 You've got a job. 
 You're taking responsibility... 
 And I am so proud of you. 
 Thanks. 
 Yep. 
 Was there something you needed to tell me? 
 Uh... 
 Man : Assemble, dignitaries. 
 Oh. 
 Thank you so much for being here tonight. 
 It means the world to Melanie and me to have all our closest friends and loved ones here. 
 'Cause the truth is, we have a surprise. 
 We're getting married. 
 We know. 
 [Laughter] 
 No, no, no, I... 
 What Melanie means to say is, we're getting married right now. 
 Now? 
 [Melanie laughs] Right now. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 It's nice to have a judge in the family. 
 [Laughter] 
 Man : Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the wedding of Andrew John Kelly and Melanie Justine Morelli. 
 If anyone present may raise objections to this union, please speak now or forever hold your peace. 
 [Laughter] 
 I cannot believe that happened. 
 They had a judge there. 
 It was just, like, "We're doing this." 
 It happened so fast, my head was spinning. 
 Hey, I thought we were quitting. 
 Whoops, I forgot. 
 You okay? 
 I guess I have to be. 
 They could still break up. 
 No, they broke up before because he would never marry her. 
 Now everything just seems so... Final. 
 Anyway, enough about me. 
 How was your night? 
 Fine, you know, just my usual premiere stress: What am I doing with my life? 
 Is there a God? 
 Does Jordan Catalano really love me? 
 Et cetera. 
 Hey, everything is gonna be okay. 
 I promise. 
 You don't know that, though, do you? 
 You don't know anything anymore. 
 Too much has changed. 
 Ugh, I better go to work. 
 It's the busiest week of the year. 
 Everyone is cold and depressed,  and the only thing that helps is four weddings and a funeral. 
 "Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed." 
 [Laughs] 
 Have a good day. 
 You too. 
 
 
 
 Let's see. 
 [Gasps] 
 A blender. Yay. 
 Ooh, Andy, we could make smoothies. 
 You want one right now? 
 Are you sure you don't feel robbed of having a big wedding? 
 I am so happy to be married to you. 
 I think we had a beautiful wedding. 
 Mm. 
 Both : Mm. 
 Mm-mm. 
 Mm. 
 We have to do the list. 
 One blender... 
 Melanie : From the Kleins. 
 Thank you. 
 Mm. 
 And the flute set... 
 [Sighs] We love that. 
 Oh, I love that. 
 Who's it from? 
 It's the Normiles. 
 Mm. 
 Friend of my parents. 
 Friend of your parents. 
 I'll write the note. 
 You can never have too many vases. 
 [Giggles] 
 No, man, you don't understand. 
 This is the first time my dad's told me he's proud of me in a long, long time. 
 Okay, you really need to calm down, dude. 
 Anybody could have stolen that pad. 
 He can't pin it on you. 
 [Knocking] 
 Hi. 
 Um, I just came to check on you. 
 Well, you know, don't call ahead or anything. 
 I didn't have any quarters. 
 Okay. Um... 
 Did you take care of whatever was going on? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Everything went as well as could be expected. 
 Good. 
 Yeah. 
 Lolly, look, I'm really sorry I even mentioned anything to you. 
 I really, really am. Like, just forget all about it. 
 'Cause everything's fine. I'm fine. 
 Everything's fine. 
 Jamie, remember I said that you could always talk to me if things got weird. 
 That was a really long time ago. 
 And a lot has changed since then. 
 Yeah, well, I haven't, and I'm still here. 
 I kind of wish you weren't. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I won't be. 
 Fantastic. 
 Look, just because things didn't work out between us doesn't mean that I don't care. 
 Well, I don't care.

 You want to walk? 
 Yes. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's walk. 
 Honestly, I thought I blew that audition... 
 Like, blew it. 
 And I was so sad because it was such a good part. 
 And now it's yours! 
 I know! 
 Rick, something celebratory... 
 Champagne. 
 Does this look like a place that serves champagne? 
 Use your imagination. 
 Lolly : Really? 
 Whoo! 
 Oh, my goodness. 
 I honestly can't believe this is happening. 
 I am really going. 
 And I'm gonna miss you guys. 
 Aw. 
 Mm. Oh, L.A.'s not that far. 
 And it's only 12 weeks. 
 I mean, unless you fall in love...

 You know, I always promised myself, when I got a big break, I would just turn on a dime and go. 
 Hey, you got it. 
 And now I'm going.

I do. I love you. Okay? Man : ♪ come on ♪ No! No, stop! You don't get to just come in here and lay that on me and then just what... Just walk away. Look, I... I love you too. I mean, I hate you. I hate you. And I love you. What have you done? Man : ♪ Come on, Eileen ♪ 
♪ Too-loo-rye-ay ♪ Listen, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take care of you. 'Cause I love you. Man : ♪ Too-ra-loo-ra ♪ 
♪ Too-ra-loo-rye-ay ♪ 1996! Man : ♪ It's the end of the world as we know it ♪ 
♪ It's the end of the world as we know it ♪ It's okay. It's okay. You're the greatest person that has ever lived, you know that? I am so glad I traveled back in time to be with you. Me too! I love you. I love you! Kevin! Hey. Happy New Year. [Together] : Happy New Year! Wait! It's almost New Year! I'm gonna go get us some drinks. Good idea. Whoo! She's amazing, isn't she? She's pretty great. She can read me like a book she's already read. What do you mean? Little things, you know. She, uh... She understands my moods. She finishes my sentences. She knew that thing about me liking apricot jam. Man : ♪ End of the world as we know it ♪ Apricot jam? Hey! Hurry, they're gonna do a countdown! This all happened before. Lolly. Lolly! Lolly! Lolly! This all happened before. Well, not this exactly. But you and Kevin. That happened. Yeah. Yes. Sean and I were so unhappy. Oh, my God, you were with Sean. We were in such a bad place, and you were so sick of hearing about it. I mean, you were still single, so you didn't get it. Wow, yeah, that must have so hard for you. And Kevin moved to New York for his Start-up, and you reconnected, and you were in love with him. But I never told him. But then I... I ran into him on the street one day after another awful fight with Sean, and he just... He listened to me. And then we just... we started seeing more of each other. But I knew I had to get out of my marriage. And Sean was a mess, and I didn't know what would happen to him if I left him, and I knew that if I stayed with him, that we would both drown. So you told me. On New Year's Eve. And what? I said that I felt betrayed and that you crushed my faith in friendship and love in one blow... Something like that? Becca : Something like that, yeah. But that was essentially the message. And we never spoke again. No, but, Lolly, this is just a story. It's like a fairy tale in a book. Nothing even happened yet. But it did happen, Becca. It did happen... All of it. All of it happened. I told you that I was in love with someone, and what? You grabbed him out from under me, and you lied about it? I tried to tell you. I did so many times. I just... I don't know. I just... I was a coward. How long? How long what? How long were you sneaking around with him behind my back? It was about six months. Six months. This is what you do, isn't it? You and your big blue eyes and your... your pretty blonde hair, you just... you can't help that men fall hopelessly in love with you. But you know what, you can help it! You chose not to stop it because you wanted it! That's who you are! I didn't know. I didn't know how it was gonna play out in the end. How was I supposed to? But this is why. This... this is the reason why I'm back. Don't you see? I see it now. It's to undo this. You can't save this because it happened. I... I can't be friends with someone who has this inside of them. It all makes so much sense to me now. We hadn't spoken in ten years because you... You are a bad person. Lolly, please don't leave me. You make me sick. Lolly, don't... [Crying] Lolly! You can't even make one decision, so every decision you make sets you off course. It's a universal law. Take a cue for everything that's happened since you called off your wedding, and stay out of it. I thought we were starting something. Man : ♪ Don't move, don't talk out of time ♪ Get over yourself, and go to hell. Andy : I can't talk to you, Becca. It's not good for me, being around you. Crowd : Nine, eight, seven... Lolly : You ruined everything. I hope you're happy. Crowd : Three, two, one... Happy New Year! Man : ♪ Don't check, just balance on the fence ♪ Lolly : This friendship... You know, the one that means everything to you... It's over. [Elevator dings] [Becca sniffles] Man : ♪ Don't whisper, don't talk, don't run if you can walk ♪ 
♪ Don't cheat, compete, don't miss the one beat ♪ 
♪ ♪ I want to go back. Please. I want to go back! Take me back! Assembled dignitaries... I want to go back! Give me my ring back. I can't. So her first marriage was a disaster. I should have confronted you the second I found out you kissed him. [Crying] Man : ♪ Don't project, don't connect, protect ♪ 
♪ don't expect, suggest ♪ 
♪ don't project, don't connect, protect ♪ 
♪ don't expect, suggest ♪ Man : ♪ I feel numb ♪ Man : ♪ Don't struggle, don't jerk, don't collar, don't work ♪
