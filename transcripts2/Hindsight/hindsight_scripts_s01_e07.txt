 Becca : Previously on  Hindsight ... 
 Andy got into an accident, and he's okay. 
 I was going to the lake house. 
 To see Becca? 
 This is all your fault. 
 You have feelings for my fiancée. 
 She's not your fiancée anymore. 
 You should be with Melanie, Andy. 
 I thought we were starting something. 
 Go to hell. 
 Paige : Who was the guy that dropped you off at the concert? 
 Kevin. 
 He is cute. 
 You really like him, don't you? 
 I don't know. 
 I actually have a new thing too. 
 I think I have to break up with him. 
 Is there someone else? 
 Maybe. 
 You could come stay with us. 
 What do you think, you want to come up? 
 I wish I could retrace my steps and make a different decision. 
 Do you have to go? 
 Not if you need me. 
 I need you.

 Man on TV : Administration has promised that social security and medicare checks will be... 
 What? 
 I was just thinking about our first time together. 
 Seems like a lifetime ago. 
 Man on TV : More than 3.3 million people will be delayed. 
 According to the veteran affairs department, checks are supposed to be mailed on December 29, but the department has neither... 
 [Clears throat] 
 Um... 
 I'm gonna take a shower. 
 You know where the clean towels are, right? 
 Will be able to stay on the job. 
 This was the longest in history. 
 Yeah.

 No! 
 Hey. 
 90210  again? 
 [Whimpers] 
 Why aren't you watching the Thanksgiving day parade? 
 You're gonna wear out that tape. 
 You've seen her die, like, ten times already. 
 I've seen the parade ten times already. 
 It never changes. 
 Giant Winnie the Pooh, freezing cold rockettes. 
 Snore. 
 Oh, coffee. 
 Oh, God. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Oh. 
 So are things back to normal with Sean? 
 What's normal? 
 Becca... 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Because things are different now. 
 In a lot of good ways. 
 I mean, I can't help but feel like I'm supposed to be with Sean, like, maybe he's my "yellow brick road." 
 And if I'm on my right path, then maybe everyone else can get back on theirs. 
 I hear a "but" coming, Dorothy. 
 We're just having trouble connecting. 
 Which means you still aren't doing it. 
 We used to do it everywhere. 
 Like, everywhere. 
 Hot tubs, airplane bathrooms, taxis. 
 I know. 
 Guinness book of world records. 
 But now it's like, neither of us can cross this invisible line. 
 Becca, I'm gonna ask you this once, then I promise I'll never ask you again, but is Andy still in your head? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Andy's not my path. 
 I'm moving forward. 
 Like a shark. 
 Just when I thought it was safe to go back in the water. 
 I'm gonna go change so I can meet Sean and we can go to my parents together. 
 Okay. 
 What are you wearing tonight? 
 I don't know yet. 
 But you know I always bring the ruckus for Aunt Libby. 
 I think you love my aunt Libby more than you love anyone else in your own family. 
 That is 100% true. 
 Libby is the only person I trust over 30. 
 Well, her and Colin Powell. 
 Man on TV : It's not the classic rivalry, but certainly every time these two teams get together... 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 So who do you like? 
 The Lions have Barry Sanders, and he's the best player in the game. 
 I like talent. 
 I called you. 
 I left a message. 
 I got it. 
 You didn't call me back. 
 I'm sorry I didn't come to your play. 
 I should've been there. 
 It's cool. Things come up. 
 So you're working all day? No turkey dinner for you? 
 No longing for the traditions of your ancestors? 
 They're not my ancestors. 
 Yes, that's right. 
 Look, I'm from a penal colony in the South Pacific, so I... 
 Thanksgiving is a day for family gathering, and since I don't exactly gather with my family anymore, it's just as soon act like it doesn't exist. 
 To me, it's just another Thursday, and on Thursdays, I eat tacos. 
 How about you? 
 I'm going to the Bradys. 
 Becca and I are back together. 
 I heard. 
 Congratulations? 
 She was my fiancée, Paige. 
 You don't have to explain yourself. 
 You're doing what you feel is right. 
 Just not sure if I could do it. 
 Libby : Hello? 
 Guillermo downstairs let me up. 
 I think he's in love with me. 
 Libby, you look great. 
 Oh, thanks, sis. 
 I'd look better with a drink in my hand. 
 Well, you know where the bar is. 
 I do. 
 Help yourself. 
 First you get kicked off the track team. 
 And then you get that citation for public drunkenness. 
 And, you know, we still haven't untangled that fiasco with the damn limousine. 
 But now I get a letter telling me that my son's account has been suspended because apparently he is on academic probation. 
 How could you do this to yourself? 
 College is hard. 
 You know, usually it's three strikes and you're out. 
 But you're, like, on your tenth. 
 How many strikes do you expect to get, hmm? 
 You tell me. 
 None. Zero. No more strikes. 
 [Groans] Okay. 
 Okay, look, I'll just... I'll do another semester and then I'll knock out the two classes. 
 Oh, really? 
 And who's gonna pay for that, huh? 
 Is that a trick question? 
 No, you are gonna pay for it. 
 Whoa, you can't... You can't be serious. 
 [Sighs] Yeah, Jamie. 
 I am. 
 This is what a serious man looks like. 
 [Stammers] 
 Please take a good look. 
 Hi. 
 Uh... 
 Um... 
 I can go downstairs and wait for Becca, if you want. 
 She's coming with Sean. 
 Hmm. 
 They were meeting up before coming here to get a pie, or... whatever. 
 Yeah, fine, fine. Whatever. 
 Wait. Are you okay? 
 Yeah, Lolly, I'm good. 
 I'm just, you know, trying to make it back to my room. 
 But, you know, make yourself at home. 
 Is that my illegitimate daughter, la-la-la-Lolly? 
 Ahh! Aunt Libby, hello! 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Look at you. 
 You look spectacular, as usual. 
 Well, you know I always go all out for the solstice. 
 [Door slams] 
 Boy trouble? 
 Sort of. 
 Who needs 'em? 
 Come on, get drunk with me. 
 It's the only way to do this holiday. 
 Right through here, bar number two. 
 Man on TV : From the 31, the give out of the backfield to Sanders. 
 Across the 34, to the 35 yard line. 
 It'll be a pickup of 4 on the play. 
 Second down and 6. 
 You okay? 
 Totally. 
 My parents are looking forward to seeing you. 
 No, they're not. 
 Okay, I think I have a 5. 
 No, I got it. I got it. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Andy, Melanie. 
 You guys are here. 
 We were invited. 
 No, yeah, I know, I just... 
 I didn't know you guys were coming. 
 Andy, you look so good. I mean, well... you look well. 
 Health-wise. Healthy. 
 It's weird we didn't run into you guys in the lobby or on the elevator. 
 We took the stairs. 
 Becca's developed a bit of a phobia. 
 Ten flights. 
 Who's healthy now? 
 [Laughter] 
 So you two are back together? 
 Yeah, we are. 
 And you guys too? 
 Well, we never technically broke up. 
 We were just... 
 It was just a blip. 
 Oh, well, I'm so happy for you. 
 Come here! 
 Ahh. 
 Yay. 
 Thank you. 
 It's great. 
 Oh. Thank you. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm so happy for all of us. 
 Doesn't this all just feel so right? 
 This is nice. 
 Guys, get in here! 
 Chris Carter just caught a 60-yard pass. 
 Come on, you got to see the replay. 
 Becca : Okay. 
 Have fun. 
 Thanks. 
 I don't like football. 
 I'll go... be helpful. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 Come on. 
 Listen, Jamie is my nephew, and I adore him, but you made the right choice. 
 If someone doesn't cut the mustard, you cut 'em off. 
 That's what I do. 
 Do I not look happy to you, or what? 
 You look fabulous. 
 You always look fabulous. 
 It's because I've discovered the secret... 
 Being free. 
 Don't weigh yourself down with a man. 
 My rule: Six weeks. 
 Eight if they have a beach house. 
 And after that, you get out. 
 It's the law of diminishing returns. 
 Libs, I think I want to be you when I grow up. 
 Oh, my God, honey, that is such an achievable goal. 
 Man on TV : And bring the ball up to the 24 yard line... 
 So, Sean, you need me to explain American football to you? 
 No, I'm good. 
 I like the Lions. 
 Sure about that? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, they got Barry Sanders. 
 Best player in the game. 
 I like talent. 
 Anybody care to make it interesting? 
 I don't think you can make American football interesting. 
 I'm talking about a wager. 
 Oh, yeah? How much? 
 50 bucks? 
 Why not? 
 Is there anything for me to do? 
 Oh, the turkey's in the oven and everything else just needs to be nuked, so... 
 ♪ What can Melanie do? ♪ 
 She can string the cranberries. 
 Perfect. 
 So just thread the cranberry like a bead. 
 Ahh. 
 This is normally Becca's job. 
 But she hates it. 
 How thoughtful of you to offer it to me. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Ah, that's Frank and Jane. 
 I know it feels like you're making cranberry necklaces like a preschooler, but my mom thinks that making cranberry links makes our Thanksgiving more legit. 
 Go away, please. 
 What? 
 Just leave me alone and go away. 
 I'm not here to talk to you. I'm here for Andy. 
 It's unfortunate that being with Andy means occasionally I have to put up with you, but I'm not gonna just stand here and pretend like we're friends. 
 Um, I can't really go anywhere, Melanie. 
 This is my family's house. 
 Well, it's not like you're cooking anything. 
 I'm nuking. 
 Come on! 
 Why aren't they hiking the ball? 
 27 seconds between plays? 
 Yeah, they're bleeding the clock. 
 It's called game strategy. 
 It's how you play with a lead. 
 Georgie : Lincoln, the Kellys are here. 
 Come and say hi! 
 Okay. You gonna say hi to your folks? 
 No, we had breakfast this morning. 
 Okay. Nobody takes that seat. 
 So... 
 So... 
 You play football growing up? 
 Does Nintendo count? 
 Congratulations, by the way. 
 Oh, I wouldn't say Detroit's won just yet. 
 I'm not talking about the game. 
 I'm talking about you and Becca getting back together. 
 Just so there isn't any lingering confusion... 
 I don't have feelings for her. 
 I don't think that. 
 You said that... 
 When we were at the bar, with Jamie? 
 The wall? 
 I was wasted. 
 We were in the middle of a drinking game. 
 We both said some things we didn't mean. 
 Unless of course you meant what you said. 
 Remind me what I said. 
 That I don't deserve Becca. 
 Just as long as she's happy. 
 Lincoln : Okay. 
 What did I miss? 
 Man on TV : And brought down. 
 That's a 2-yard gain by Lee. 
 Hey, Sam. What's up? 
 How's your dad's? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, you think you can, uh, get out of there for about an hour or so? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bring that. 
 All right, cool. All right, see you there. 
 [Tapping on door] 
 Georgie : Jamie? 
 What are you doing in here? 
 I wanted to watch the game alone. 
 Sighs : What about your room? 
 There's no lock on my door. 
 At least come and say hi to Frank and Jane. 
 They just arrived. 
 Mom, they're gonna be here all night. 
 That wasn't a request. 
 He is a cut-up. 
 Hi, Kellys. Bye, Kellys. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't know why he just did that. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hey. That was so rude. 
 I'm sure they'll survive. 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Nothing. Becca, nothing's wrong with me. 
 I just wanted to get out of there. 
 Well, Mom's not gonna let you go anywhere. 
 It's Thanksgiving. And she shopped for hours. 
 Well, today I'm thankful for smoke breaks. 
 Page me when dinner starts. 
 Just promise me one thing... 
 This time with Sean, elope. 
 [Laughs] 
 We're not even close to talking about that, Mom. 
 That's smart. Take your time. 
 Let your parents save up a little, hock a few heirlooms. 
 Maybe the silver. 
 No. Jewelry, the car? 
 Oh, you can hock your own jewelry. 
 I'm glad you two are finding this so amusing. 
 Oh, lighten up, Becca. We're just yanking your chain. 
 Thanks for illuminating that, Melanie. 
 Ow! Damn it! 
 Sweetheart. 
 Let me see. Let me see. 
 Aw, poor Becca. 
 She'll be fine, Melanie. 
 I'm fine. 
 I've got some aloe. Put it on. 
 I don't want it to blister, okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Okay, okay. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Go away. 
 Your mom said you burned yourself. 
 She sent me in here to help. 
 Did she tell you where the aloe was? 
 Ta-da. 
 All right, let's have a look. 
 Whoa. 
 Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. 
 This happened before. 
 Well, it wouldn't be cooking with Becca Brady without first-degree burns, would it? 
 You should be banned from all kitchens for life. 
 Are you okay? 
 It hurts. 
 May I kiss it, make it better?

 This happened last time. 
 All of it... The burn, the aloe. 
 The stupid toddler bandage. 
 Maybe things are getting on course after wall. 
 So how was it? 
 The s*x? 
 Oh, mind-blowing, but more importantly, he held my hand. 
 Are you falling back in love with him? 
 I never wasn't in love with him. 
 Man on TV : What a move. 
 And hands off to Lee, who gained 3 yards. 
 How did you know that I drank snakebites? 
 Didn't they tell you? I'm also a psychic. 
 I've been working here long enough to know what my regulars drink. 
 Besides, I figured if you're here today, you must really need it. 
 Well, you know what too much family time can do to a person. 
 Well, feel free to hang here with my lovely Thanksgiving family for as long as you want. 
 Hey, um, I know you and my sister are friends, but can you just do me a favor and don't tell her that I'm here? 
 Jamie, when you walk through those doors, you've got complete bartender-customer confidentiality. 
 Man on TV : Great protection... 
 Thank you. 
 No prob. 
 Cheers. 
 [All shouting] 
 Come on, Frank. That calls for a drink. 
 Sighs : Hey... no, no, no, please. 
 You managed to make the game interesting, but I can't take your money. 
 Take Becca out to a nice dinner. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Just a suggestion. 
 Sore winner. 
 Mrs. Brady wanted me to get you for dinner. 
 What's up? 
 I want to leave. 
 Just tell Mrs. Brady I feel sick. 
 Do you? 
 Does being sick of being around Becca count? 
 Hey, did something happen? 
 No, she just makes me uncomfortable. 
 I can't explain it. 
 I feel, like, invisible around this family. 
 Is somebody talking in here? 
 Is somebody in here with me? 
 Stop. 
 Oh, whoa... Who did that? 
 Is there a ghost in here? 
 Hey, she's not treating you like you're invisible, okay? 
 What about the big hug that she gave you? 
 What a phony. 
 You know what? 
 What? 
 I'm happy she burned herself. 
 Okay. 
 Got that little venom out. 
 You feel better? 
 Kind of. 
 Good. 
 Can you stay here with me? 
 If it's important to you, I'll always be here. 
 Good. 
 'Cause Mrs. Brady makes a mean turkey. 
 Of course the Brady turkey would be mean. 
 Lolly : Yummy! 
 Jane : Thank you, darling. 
 Honey, where's Jamie? 
 Um, he just stepped outside for a minute. 
 I can't believe he just disappears on the one night that I would like to have everyone here. 
 What is he running away from? 
 We should just start, babe. 
 No, we'll wait till everyone's here. 
 I'll go page him. 
 Thank you.

 Oh, whenever we want, dude. 
 It's my dad's plane. 
 Must be nice. 
 You should come, dude. 
 Thanks, man, but no, I don't think I can. 
 My dad's all over me right now for failing these two classes. 
 Says I got to make up the semester, I got pay for it myself. 
 Oh, that's so sad. 
 What does that have to do with this though? 
 Come on, dude, blow off steam for a second, right? 
 You've got free will. You can do what you want. 
 Mm... 
 Right? 
 Do you even have room for me? 
 Oh, 13 bedrooms... 
 Yeah, I think we can find you a spot. 
 Smart-ass. 
 Just think about it, dude. 
 Ah, no, man. Not this time, you know? 
 But you think I could get the rest of this? 
 Um, will this cover it? 
 Whoa, you can have it for free, Mister Big Shot. 
 It's just standard New York blow. 
 Too bad I don't have the balls to bring back some of the Dominican's finest on the plane. 
 It's cheap as dirt, and we can get ten times for it here. 
 Maybe 15 from some dumb-ass college kids. 
 You think that would cover your extra semester? 
 [Tapping glass] 
 I'd like to say a few words, if I may. 
 A few weeks ago, Jane and I got the phone call that no parent ever wants to get. 
 And every day since then has felt like a gift. 
 I want to thank you all for rallying around our family, and I think God every single day that you're okay, son. 
 We love you. 
 Here, here. 
 Cheers. 
 We love you, Andy. 
 [Glasses clink] 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 So if you guys don't mind, there's something I'd like to say too. 
 At some point between leaving my apartment and waking up in a hospital bed, um, I had a vision. 
 I saw myself in the future. 
 20 years from now. 
 I had a suit. 
 I cut my hair. 
 I even had that elusive thing called "style." 
 [Laughter] 
 And I was walking to my apartment with this feeling of confidence and calm that I've never really felt before. 
 And then I realized why. 
 My wife was standing there, beautiful as the day I met her, welcoming me home and making me feel safe and loved, just as she always has. 
 Just as she did when I was in the hospital... 
 And just as she's doing right now. 
 Will you marry me? 
 Yeah! 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Someone's in here. 
 It's just me. 
 Are you okay? 
 Andy and Melanie never got engaged before. 
 Well, is that bad? 
 It's just things veering off course again. 
 It's terrifying. 
 I don't know how this story ends now. 
 Well... 
 Maybe... maybe being with Melanie is what keeps Andy safe and the universe is just making super sure this time by having them get married. 
 Look at what the universe has given you, okay? 
 A second chance with a man you love. 
 Don't blow it. 
 This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
 Or is it twice in a lifetime, twice in two lifetimes? 
 Oh, my God, I lost track. 
 [Laughs] 
 Let's go before your mom has a complete nervous collapse. 
 Up. 
 Oh, it's stunning, Melanie. 
 Good job, Andy. 
 I had a ring like this once. 
 I sold it and got a car. 
 It's a beautiful ring, Melanie. 
 Thank you. 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Glass clinking] 
 I would like to make a toast to the happy couple. 
 You know, we've all been itching for a wedding, and it'll be nice to finally scratch the itch, right? 
 'Cause our last opportunity went kaboom, right? 
 But maybe Becca and... 
 Sean will give it another go. 
 What do you say? 
 Are your cold feet getting warm, Becca? 
 Don't even dignify her with a response. 
 Come on, I'm just asking what no one will ask. 
 Why Becca left Sean at the altar, and what are they doing together now? 
 I mean, everyone's thinking it. 
 Libby, please don't. 
 Sean : Becca could see something that I couldn't, Libby. 
 For some people, the timing is right, and everyone's emotions are in the right place, but others just need some time to figure out what they want. 
 And I'm thankful that Becca had the foresight to see that. 
 Thank you. 
 [Door shuts] 
 Lincoln : Well, you missed Thanksgiving, Jamie. 
 Hmm, it's too bad. 
 'Cause this really looks like it was a blast. 
 Well, I enjoyed it. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Slurping] 
 Well, this is definitely one for the archives. 
 Or not. 
 I think you spent 50% of your night in here. 
 Can't wait for Christmas. 
 I think I need something stronger than wine. 
 Me too. 
 I'm gonna go use the phone in your room. 
 Okay. 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Yeah, okay, come in. 
 May I use the bathroom, or is this your exclusive domain? 
 Oh, yeah, no. 
 Go ahead; It's all yours. 
 Um, congratulations on your engagement. 
 Martha Stewart says you're supposed to congratulate the groom and say "best wishes" to the bride. 
 Oh. 
 Well, best wishes, then. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, God. 
 How many weekends did we spend at that condo in Killington? 
 You were the only one who ever wanted to go snowshoeing. 
 I can't talk to you. 
 What? 
 I can't talk to you, Becca. 
 Melanie's making you ice me out? 
 No. 
 This is my decision. 
 It's not good for me, being around you. 
 I came here for my parents and your parents. 
 But that's all. 
 Well, congratulations. 
 And best wishes to Melanie. 
 [Machine beeps] 
 Man : You have no new messages. 
 Oh, sorry, I didn't realize anyone was in here. 
 I'm done. 
 I was just gonna give my parents a call. 
 All yours. 
 You probably think I'm stupid, don't you? 
 What? 
 For saying yes to Andy after everything that's happened. 
 I would've said no if I didn't love him. 
 I don't think you're stupid. 
 Not at all. 
 I think you're smart, actually, and brave. 
 I mean, Andy wants you, and you want him, and you're making a commitment. 
 I really respect that, Melanie. 
 We could all probably take a page out of your book. 
 Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 Pumpkin cheesecake. 
 Even if it's bad, it still has to be kind of good, right? 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm so glad my mom saved those. 
 Aren't you? 
 For weeks, all I've been trying to figure out is why you left me at the altar, and I understand. 
 We weren't ready? 
 But you coming back to me, us being here tonight, all that doesn't change the fact that it did happen, and it nearly destroyed me. 
 So the only thing going through my mind is, what am I doing here with you now? 
 And I think I figured that out too. 
 I'm chasing this. 
 But this is gone. 
 But what about today in the bathroom? 
 What about it? 
 s*x was never the problem. 
 That wasn't just s*x. 
 Yes, it was. 
 I have to go. 
 No. Sean. 
 Don't go. 
 You're right. 
 We're not meant to be together. 
 This could never work. 
 No, what if I was wrong? 
 What if I was wrong? 
 No one knows the future, Becca. 
 But I know that I can't be here now, that I can't be with you. 
 Sean. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's just... It's a new path, a new course. 
 I can't believe that just happened. 
 [Door latches open] 
 Did I just see Sean leaving? 
 Oh, my God, it's Courtney. 
 Lolly : Wait, Courtney, Courtney? 
 Phoebe's future husband, Courtney. 
 Phoebe : Becca, Lolly, come over here and meet my new boyfriend. 
 Wait, ddin't you screw that up? 
 Apparently not. 
 Phoebe : The morning after we were supposed to go on our blind date, I was at this coffee place where they write your name on the cup, and I hear, "I have a nonfat latte for Courtney." 
 And I'm thinking, "no way." 
 So I turn around, and I see this guy grab the cup. 
 How many boys could there be named Courtney? 
 There were actually four at my fraternity at UVA. 
 [Laughter] 
 So I go, and I introduce myself, and I apologize for the previous night. 
 And I said, "you don't have to apologize." 
 She got the wrong restaurant. 
 It happens. 
 And here we are. 
 Here we are. 
 Aww. 
 Libby : So demanding. 
 It's so nice to see you, princess. 
 How was it at your dad's? 
 How's whats-her-name? 
 Uh, Judy is fine. 
 Oh. 
 Hope she can cook better than she can dress. 
 [Laughs] 
 Phoebe : Mom, I thought you were taking it easy on the booze. 
 I am taking it easy. 
 Let me take you home, okay? 
 Sure, just get rid of me like everyone else gets rid of me. 
 Can I put you in a cab, Aunt Libby? 
 No! 
 Okay. 
 Lolly will walk me downstairs. 
 Okay, yeah. 
 I'll take her. 
 Becca : Thank you. 
 [Mouthing words] 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 [Sighs] 
 Help. 
 I need some shelter from the storm. 
 You can stay here as long as you like, sis. 
 You going somewhere? 
 Yep. 
 I am going to the Dominican Republic. 
 With Stanton? 
 Did we have this conversation already, and I forgot it? 
 No, Jamie, why don't you blow off this trip and stay here? 
 I'll stay here with you. 
 We'll watch  My Cousin Vinny  and pull out the ping-pong table and talk about how crazy Mom and Dad and Libby are all night. 
 I can't. 
 Please? 
 I can't. 
 For me? 
 I can't. I can't be here. 
 I can't... I can't be around Dad right now. 
 I want you to stay. 
 Well, I've decided it doesn't really matter what you want. 
 Look, this is... This is my life. 
 I mean, what's it gonna take for you to accept the fact that you don't control the universe? 
 Come back. 
 [Sighs] 
 Becca, I might be so tan you might not recognize me, but I'll be back on Sunday. 
 No, you won't. 
 I love 'em. 
 I'm borrowing those earrings. 
 Wore 'em for you, so... 
 Oh, honey. 
 We got to hang out sometime, okay? 
 Yeah. 
 You're so much more fun than Phoebe. 
 [Laughs] 
 You get me. 
 In fact, in a lot of ways, you are me. 
 But cuter. 
 [Laughs] 
 Bye, honey. 
 [Grunts] 
 Okay.

 ♪ 
 Is Aunt Libby the ghost of my Thanksgiving future? 
 No. 
 You look like a scared toon about to be dipped by Christopher Lloyd. 
 This was an epically bad night. 
 The cranberry sauce wasn't bad. 
 ♪ Just hear this ♪ 
 Jamie's going to the Dominican Republic with Stanton. 
 He is? 
 Lucky duck. 
 No. 
 The last time Jamie went to the Dominican Republic with Stanton, he didn't come back for a year. 
 This was the beginning of his downfall. 
 I let him go last time, and I just let him go again. 
 What's wrong with me? 
 Oh, Becca. 
 Nothing. 
 Look, if he's not back in a month, we'll go down and get him, okay? 
 Okay. 
 But you have to let him go. 
 You can't protect everybody from everything all the time. 
 But if I'm destined to end up like Libby, please protect me. 
 Libby ends up alone, Lolly. 
 You will never be alone. 
 [Sighs] 
 And you know what? 
 I might have blown it with Sean, but Phoebe found Courtney out there in this great big, crazy world. 
 Which means? 
 The universe has a plan. 
 Let's go home. 
 Yeah.

 Tucker's? 
 Okay. 
 We're gonna stop worrying about stupid stuff like true love and destiny and start focusing on more important things like, are we watching  Home Alone  or  Home Alone 2: Lost in New York  tonight? 
 Are you kidding? 
 The sequel. 
 So underrated. 
 Oh, no. 
 Where is it? 
 It's probably hiding in my room. 
 Or causing trouble at the Plaza. 
 [Knocks on door] 
 I'll get it. 
 Kevin. 
 That's right, yeah. 
 You must be Becca. 
 It's nice to finally meet you.
