 MERS is contagious... 15 blade. 
 Oh, great, thank you, Nurse. 
 And usually difficult to distinguish until it's got a firm grip on the patient. 
 Anna, I told you. It's incredible. 
 In this case, the virus has caused septicemia, which seeded Mr. Aaron's liver, which is why he has a large right lobe hepatic abscess on the dome. 
 Bovie. 
 You're quick on the draw. 
 Just doing my job, Doctor. 
 I can't get to the abscess from this approach.

 She's exhibiting symptoms of MERS. 
 She was wearing a protective suit. 
 So were the health workers in Texas who got Ebola. 
 Everyone, out. 
 We've set up a testing station outside the OR, please have your blood drawn. 
 It takes two days for MERS to show up on the serum PCR, Dr. Shane. You know that. 
 We're still checking everyone's blood and swabbing them. 
 Oral and nasal. Show's over!

 Callahan said you've been applying for your U.S. certifications. 
 Callahan has a big mouth.

 Ji-Sung's in there. 
 Doctors, this is Dr. Brenneman, he's the ID expert from the CDC. 
 He's here to give us a quick tutorial on MERS. 
 Thank you for coming at such short notice. 
 Until we can get confirmation on Nurse Lyons' blood work... 
 How is Nurse Lyons doing? 
 She's stable, but her fever is still high. 
 Now... 
 Is that typical of MERS? 
 It can be. 
 Now, if I can continue. 
 There is no vaccine for MERS, or no antiviral treatment... 
 So no antibiotics? 
 Would you let him finish, please? 
 Roger that. 
 Antibiotics have no effect and can cause a super-infection.

 Uh-huh. You tell me why? 
 Sympathetic effusion. 
 An exudative pleural effusion caused by disease in a nearby structure.

 Is there an office where we can convene, once we've done a thorough sweep? 
 Yes, but as you can imagine, the hospital would rather keep this as quiet as possible.

 We're looking at the wrong disease. 
 If that's the case, I feel confident the CDC will discover what it is. 
 What's going on? 
 The board is questioning my judgment for hiring you, as well as my inability to get you to conform to hospital protocol.

 He was with me when I spoke to the board. 
 Why? 
 Because he has a lot of influence, and he can help me fight for you. 
 Jesse can't help me. 
 He works for the hospital that fired my ass. 
 Well, that's not entirely true. 
 When the board ordered me to terminate your contract, Jesse quit.

 Well, he told the board if they wanted to make St. Matthew's a top research institute, they needed somebody like you. 
 Arrogant, rude, disrespectful, oblivious to consequences, rude, arrogant. 
 That's so sweet. 
 You know, you broke his heart. 
 Mm-mm. 
 He broke mine, so did Pierce. 
 I told Pierce I just want to be with him. 
 He's much smarter than that, Alex. 
 When it comes to Pierce and Jesse, you can't choose. 
 Yeah. 
 [soft music] 
 No. 
 Ah, ah, ah. 
 I think you've had enough, my friend. 
 I'm gonna call you a cab.

 It was fat Elvis, yeah, 'cause skinny Elvis booked another wedding. 
 There was somebody else there, 'cause how did I get here? 
 I don't know. 
 After we got married, you said you wanted to go to the casino and watch people gamble and make fun of them. 
 Sounds romantic. 
 I went to the bathroom, and I came out, and you were nowhere to be found. 
 I'm calling your cell, you're not picking up your cell, so I've been searching hospitals all day for you. 
 We're married? 
 Yeah. 
 Right? [laughs]

 You said, "I love you." 
 You said, "I will always love you."

 We got drunk. 
 I mean, we had a lot of drinks, and then we got married. 
 Skinny Elvis was our witness.
