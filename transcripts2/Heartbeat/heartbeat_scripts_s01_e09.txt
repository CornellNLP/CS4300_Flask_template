 You're gonna have to find room for it in the facilities budget, okay? 
 I've got my first board review coming up, and they're putting every department under the microscope. Just... 
 Let me just put you on hold for one minute, okay? 
 I'm trying to deal with this half-wit accountant. 
 You put me on speakerphone, Millicent. 
 [dial tone] 
 Okay, I have no reason to be nervous. 
 It's just a board review. 
 I mean, yeah, it's my first, but you know, RVUs are up, patient evals are up, and who cares if they're questioning every decision I make, right? 
 I kissed Jesse. 
 Oh. 
 Well, I can't say I'm surprised. 
 I didn't plan for this to happen. I... 
 I feel terrible. 
 I-I told Pierce this morning, and you should've seen the look on his face. 
 [gentle guitar music] 
 I told him it didn't mean anything. 
 Did he believe you? 
 Why wouldn't he? 
 Alex, why would he? 
 Look, do you want me to be honest here or just supportive? 
 Honest. 
 You and Jesse have a long, intense history together. 
 Of course that kiss meant something. 
 I changed my mind. I want you to be supportive. 
 Tell me I can fix this. 
 Tell me I won't lose Pierce. 
 [phone vibrating] 
 This is him. 
 I got to go. 
 [monitors beeping] 
 I was getting ready for work. 
 Then, I went into his room to kiss him good-bye. 
 He wasn't breathing, and his heart stopped in the ambulance. 
 I need to confer with Dr. Shane. 
 I'll be right back, Rafe. 
 [monitors beeping] 
 I heard they brought him in. 
 Yeah. 
 His brain was deprived of oxygen for too long. 
 He's not coming out of this. 
 I'm surprised they resuscitated him. 
 Case like this should be a DNR. 
 Why's he on a ventilator? 
 I made him a promise. 
 Excuse me, I need a doctor. 
 Ma'am, ma'am, I need... please... 
 I need... I need... I need a... 
 Ma'am, Doctor, I got a 237A. 
 There was a dumpster, somebody just left him in there. 
 Okay. 
 He was so scared, he seems hungry. 
 We'll take it from here. 
 I need a baby warmer, and call the NICU attending and tell them I have an infant drop-off. 
 He likes it when I sing to him. 
 He may have a wet diaper. 
 You're with me. Come on. 
 Okay. 
 Nice work, Panttiere. 
 Not bad for a first-year resident. 
 His heart's smaller than a strawberry. 
 It's amazing. 
 Nothing like a bit of trial by fire on your peds rotation. 
 [laughs] 
 That the cop who brought him in? 
 Yeah, he slept here. 
 That's above and beyond the call of duty. 
 You did good, Doctor. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 Nice work. 
 Thanks. 
 You've been here all this time? 
 Yeah, I was just reading about how fragile newborns are. 
 But he's doing okay? 
 We repaired his heart. 
 I hope he likes baseball. 
 We did a preliminary blood panel. 
 He was born HIV positive. 
 He's always gonna root for the underdog. 
 With a host of other serious medical conditions. 
 We'll go to minor-league games. 
 That's what he'll love. 
 Nothing flashy, just... all hope and heart. 
 Rafe... this is a child we don't expect to make it past his first birthday. 
 His name's Colin. 
 [baby babbling] 
 Hmm? 
 I'm adopting him. 
 There's a reason we found each other. 
 Wow. 
 Dad.

 He could give his super-atomic robot heart to the dog, so the dog could live on forever."

 And you won't ever be afraid of the dark, because my heart will always be beating. 
 Always on, like a night-light.'" 
 I'm scared of the dark. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I'll turn it back on. 
 No, I mean... the dark. 
 I want my heart to go to somebody and keep beating. 
 It just won't seem so scary that way. 
 Can you do that? 
 Colin, you have a very special heart. 
 It might not be easy to find a place for it. 
 I know what HIV-positive means. 
 Couldn't you find someone who's like me? 
 It's not that easy, and it's not just that.

 Congenital heart disease.

 Jesse, how did you get a chimpanzee into... 
 I volunteer at the local animal sanctuary. 
 The vet who runs the place is an old friend. 
 She asked me to come in for a consult. 
 And Neema has dilated cardiomyopathy. 
 You want to put my boy's heart into a chimp? 
 Yeah. 
 There has never been a human-to-animal heart transplant. 
 No, this should be the first, but blazing new trails was your speciality. 
 [Neema chittering] 
 Chimpanzee physiology is amazingly similar to humans. 
 Neema is Colin's size and weight. 
 His heart could save her life. 
 What about HIV transmission? 
 Well, the virus can replicate inside her, but infected chimps have rarely been known to develop the clinical symptoms of AIDS. 
 Cross-species heart transplant. 
 What about her metabolic state? 
 What if there's immunologic rejection... 
 I know someone who can help. 
 No. No way in hell. 
 An animal... no. 
 Rafe, I know it's a big leap, but we can't find a human candidate. 
 Still no. 
 What about Colin? 
 Didn't he love animals? What would he say? 
 You know what, you don't need to make a decision now. 
 I'm not even sure this is possible.

 I'm sure she told you about Jesse. 
 Alex tells me an alarming amount of things. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know, you and I actually have a lot in common. 
 We both think "Raw Power" was the greatest album that was ever made. 
 He's a genius. 
 We're both devilishly handsome. 
 You know I'd do you if I wasn't straight.

 Wildlife Waystation. 
 Over 500 acres, 125 different species, and we're still in Los Angeles.

 Risa to her friends, which are mostly animals. 
 Don't say I didn't warn you. [chuckles] 
 Come on, baby, take the licorice.

 Yes, there you go. 
 Good boy. Yeah. 
 Well, the similarities between human and chimp DNA are 99%. 
 Now, the chimp's chest wall is more convex. 
 It's musculature is denser. 
 Imagine how successful your surgery would be if you had the sense to ask a veterinarian to assist you. 
 Oh, yeah. What? You know of one? 
 Oh, come on. 
 So, um... how's Neema doing? 
 She's fading, Risa. 
 Mm. 
 But I still think she might change the world. 
 Yeah. 
 It's a simple idea with a fancy name. 
 Zoobiquity. 
 All living things, animals and humans, are all connected. 
 Yeah. 
 Gorillas suffer depression, cheetahs get breast cancer, but chimps can't get AIDS. 
 You help animals, and you help yourselves. 
 Imagine if doctors and vets could enhance patient care if they shared information about treatments and diagnoses for both species. 
 Yeah. 
 And Neema's surgery would certainly generate a lot of publicity. 
 Nope, no publicity. 
 Why? 
 I haven't told you the whole story, okay? 
 But... let's just say Neema didn't exactly retire from a zoo. 
 She spent 30 years locked in a cage in the basement of a medical research facility. 
 How did she get out of that cage, Jesse? 
 Someone opened it. 
 She stole it? 
 Rescued. 
 By an animal rights group. 
 Rescued? 
 Saving Neema is the right thing to do here. 
 Jesse, the hospital will come after us. 
 I don't care. I'm sorry if I involved you. 
 You want to back out? I got to do this. 
 Okay, don't. You know I have to save Colin's heart. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Are you out of your bloody mind? 
 No. Sorry. Let me rephrase that. 
 Are you both out of your bloody minds? 
 We already have the surgical infrastructure for this procedure. 
 We also have the collaboration of a highly skilled veterinarian. 
 We can turn xenotransplantation from a surgical research tool into a solution for the worldwide organ shortage. 
 Who knows where the collaboration between doctors and vets could lead? 
 At Colorado State, finding ways to save limbs in dogs has already led to treatment of teens with bone cancer. 
 Stop. It's not gonna happen. 
 Do you have any idea how damaging this would be to our reputation? To our funding? 
 Tell me this isn't about the board review coming up. 
 Let me be clear. 
 Saint Matthews is not in the zoobiquity business. 
 We are in the human health care business, and I will not sacrifice precious resources because you made an impossible promise to a little boy. 
 Fine. Well, I'm not giving up yet.
