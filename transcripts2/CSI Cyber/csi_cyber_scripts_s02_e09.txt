 Hey, it's me. 
 Don't leave a message. Text me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 She's not here. 
 I talked to the other girls and no one's seen her since lunch. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 Grace? 
 Avery. 
 Oh, my God, I'm... I'm so sorry. 
 I'm late for dinner. Let me just grab my stuff and then we... we can go. 
 We can reschedule. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I just... I... 
 I forgot what time it was. 
 I should probably change. 
 It'll only take a minute. 
 Honey, it's fine. 
 Why don't you just stay here tonight with your friends? 
 God, I'm so embarrassed. 
 Oh, see... we would have been interrupted anyway. 
 This is work. Um... 
 I need to go. 
 But we'll have dinner next week, okay? 
 Okay. 
 God, I'm so sorry. 
 No... I received a ViCAP alert. 
 A murder victim's fingerprints matched to a convicted hacker. 
 Quinn Elliot. 
 Queen of Hearts? 
 She... she's dead? 
 We're here to recover her phone. 
 Thank you for delaying the autopsy, Dr. Macy. 
 Of course. 
 But, uh, considering the condition of her body, I don't think you'll have much luck with her cell. 
 Why did D.B. have to testify in Vegas this week? 
 I don't do dead bodies. 
 He does dead bodies. 
 He's done a bunch of them. 
 He literally talks about it all the time. 
 He kind of brags about it, have you noticed that? 
 You'll be fine, Krummy. 
 Transfer everything you recover off that phone to CTOC ASAP. 
 Gloves? 
 Looks like someone found Quinn Elliot before we did. 
 Yeah. So much for long live the Queen. 
 I always felt invincible behind my computer screen. 
 Your devices aren't bulletproof, and hacking the wrong person is a chance every black hat takes. 
 We need to figure out what Quinn was working on. 
 If someone went to the trouble of tracking her down and killing her, who knows what kind of hack we'll uncover? 
 Well, that means a long list of suspects. 
 'Cause pretty much anyone Quinn ever hacked has motive. 
 She was a convicted hacker for hire. 
 Was imprisoned three years ago for hacking the Port of Seattle. 
 Made several containers of drugs disappear from shipping manifests. 
 Well, Quinn was a suspect in nine open cases. 
 Variety of charges: DDoS'ing Web sites, uncovering hidden assets in high-profile divorces, doxxing politicians. 
 All of this stuff happened before she was locked up. 
 Yeah, it says she was released just over a year ago. 
 But her parole officer lost track of her. 
 She's been off the grid ever since. 
 Did someone wait patiently to seek their revenge? 
 Or did Quinn go back to her black hat ways and piss off someone else? 
 Let's ask our only eyewitness: Quinn's phone. 
 It knows where she's been, who she was with and what she was planning next. 
 A digital record of her every move. 
 We'll question Quinn's phone to find out who killed her. 
 A watched progress bar never uploads. 
 Yeah. Can't help it. 
 I mean, we're usually chasing a screen name trying to find the hacker. 
 We never start out knowing who they are, let alone have their phone. 
 We just got an all-access pass to our hacker's life. 
 Krumitz just sent an image of Quinn's phone. 
 Let's see what the Queen of Hearts was up to. 
 Okay, Quinn activated her virtual assistant 7:57 P.M. the night she was murdered. 
 Well, the coroner put the time of death 6:00 and 8:00. 
 Those are Quinn's last words. 
 Can we recover them? 
 Dirty little secret about Isla: phone manufacturers save everything users say to their virtual assistant for at least two years. 
 I can call the DOJ and get a subpoena. 
 It's Raven, from Cyber. 
 No, it's a case... 
 What is it? What's wrong? 
 These apps, they're weak. 
 No Deep Web browser, no Bluetooth sniffer, no Wi-Fi cracker. 
 I mean, this phone could belong to anyone except a hacker. 
 No, no. Wait... wait, wait. 
 You notice anything about the calculator? 
 Well, the file size is much larger than the other apps. 
 That's a gatekeeper. 
 If we enter a passcode into the calculator's keypad, it opens up a hidden partition. 
 This is a phone within a phone. 
 It's a perfect place to hide data. 
 Whatever's inside that hidden partition could tell us everything we need to know about Quinn. 
 Break into it. 
 And then meet me in CTOC. 
 Don't look at me... I don't know how to do it. 
 Oh, goodness... 
 Go for Krummy. 
 Hey, Krummy. 
 What's up? 
 Yeah, man, um... we need to know how to crack into a hacker's passcode. 
 I got the IMEI number off Quinn's phone from Krumitz. 
 It's registered to a Lexie James. 
 An alias? 
 Apparently, Lexie or Quinn was married to a Louis James about nine months ago. 
 Metro PD is making the notification right now. 
 The DOJ came through. 
 So I'm downloading Quinn Elliot's Isla log from the phone manufacturer. 
 It's an audio file. 
 Okay. Here we go. 
 Hello, what can I help you with? 
 E-mail. Photo. 2-2-6. 
 You want me to e-mail a photo? Sure. 
 To whom would you like to send photo 2-2-6? 
 I'm sorry, I didn't get that. 
 Wait, so the last thing Quinn tried to do before she died was e-mail a photo? 
 Why not dial 911? 
 This is photo 2-2-6. 
 "Drowning. Yielding. 
 Grasping. Scarring. 
 I gave in. I won't give up." 
 Looks like an Instagram post. 
 No, it's not. 
 Hold on. 
 It's from this Web site. 
 "Miafina"? 
 Means "secret" in Malagasy. 
 This site is where users anonymously post their deepest, darkest secrets. 
 Anyone can read them. 
 It's addictive. Total click bait. 
 Photo 2-2-6 is a confession. 
 See? 
 It's got the same purple borders as all of these. 
 "I'm addicted to heroin. I'm a third-grade teacher." 
 "Helpless. Alone. Afraid. What a difference a month makes." 
 These confessions are either super shocking or vague. 
 "I told my mom I was going on a diet. I'm really anorexic." 
 Why would anybody post anything so personal? 
 It's cathartic, impersonal. 
 Often the easiest person to tell a secret to is a stranger. 
 This site has 12 million users from all over the world. 
 That's a lot of strangers. 
 Is photo 2-2-6 Quinn's confession? 
 Raven, separate the text from the image. 
 All right, a couple letters are randomly capitalized. 
 Pull them together. 
 Doesn't make sense. 
 Wait a minute, look at it backwards. 
 R-a-p-e-d. 
 "Raped. I won't give up." 
 Was Quinn a rape victim? 
 Raven, can you find this confession on the site? 
 No, it's not here. 
 But the purple border means that it was posted. 
 Maybe she had second thoughts about sharing her secret and deleted it. 
 No, the language suggests that she wasn't going to stay quiet. 
 "I won't give up" in all caps. 
 Maybe she was planning on going to the cops. 
 Or to confront her attacker... which could have resulted in her death. 
 Our suspect pool just got even bigger. 
 Thank you for taking the time to meet with us, Mr. James. 
 I know that this is a very difficult time for you. 
 I don't understand why someone would want to kill Lexie. 
 Uh, Mr. James, there's something you should know about your wife. 
 Her real name was Quinn Elliot. 
 Excuse me? 
 Your wife, Lexie, was living a dual life. 
 She was a convicted hacker, she had outstanding warrants, she was living under an alias to avoid detection. 
 No. 
 You've obviously made a mistake. 
 Lexie was a software engineer. 
 Her fingerprints are in our system under the name Quinn Elliot. 
 Now, we think she may have been killed because of something she was hacking. 
 I'm gonna need to confiscate the devices from your home. 
 Do what you want, but she would've told me. 
 Lexie and I didn't lie to each other. 
 This is absurd. 
 Mr. James, I have to ask you a very difficult question. 
 Did Lexie ever talk to you about being sexually assaulted? 
 What?! 
 No. 
 No, it... 
 She isn't who you think she is. 
 I know it seems like I didn't know my wife at all, but I would know if Lexie had been... 
 We were planning a family. 
 Saving to buy a home. 
 You're wasting your time, Agent Ryan. 
 And instead of accusing Lexie of some false identity scam, saying these awful things, you should be searching for the psychopath who killed my wife. 
 Did you see what he did to her? 
 I'm not gonna be able to help you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Check out the moves on this baby! 
 This brute force bot is grinding through 72 potential passcodes per minute, trying to crack into Quinn's hidden partition. 
 Hey, don't touch it. 
 I don't want to have to start over. 
 We're lucky that this calculator app only accepts numbers. 
 No letters or symbols means there's only about 10 billion possible combinations. 
 Yeah, but Quinn programmed the calculator to overwrite the hidden partition if it senses a forensic tool. 
 Now, are you sure we're not gonna lose everything. 
 No, the bot replicates the action of entering a code. 
 It stopped. 
 All right, we're in. 
 All right, cool! 
 Send the data to CTOC and I'll meet you there. 
 This is a sick hacker's toolbox. 
 A Wi-Fi password cracker? 
 Blackshades command and control? 
 I've never seen this Pen Testing tool before but... 
 Nelson, check it out. Yeah. 
 She's got a ToggleFly exploit, which means that the site is an easy target. 
 That could be worth some serious cash. 
 I know hackers who would do anything to get their hands on that. 
 Is that what I think it is? 
 May I present Quinn Elliot, hidden partition and all. 
 That leaves only one question. 
 Was Quinn killed by someone in her cyber world or her real world? 
 Well, it looks like she logged into a coffee shop's open Wi-Fi network every day. 
 Hackers use open networks to stay anonymous. 
 They're the sharks in open Wi-Fi water. 
 That's why so many people get hacked in coffee shops. 
 Maybe Quinn was hacking. 
 Okay, think I might have something here. 
 Shield Wallet. 
 Hackers for hire use it to accept anonymous payments from their clients. 
 Can't be tracked. 
 Quinn was loaded. 
 She's got half a mil here. 
 Her husband said they were saving up to buy a house. 
 He had no idea she was stashing all this money away. 
 Last payment she received was for $25,000, eight days ago. 
 Our hacker for hire was back in business. 
 Why would she hide the Miafina app behind the partition? 
 Yeah, well, it looks like Quinn was hired to hack the site Miafina a week ago. 
 She found a backdoor and identified who posted every secret. 
 And look at all those names. 
 What people thought was anonymous is no longer. 
 Hi, honey. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Beltway was backed up. 
 It's okay. 
 This is a massive data dump. 
 This is Ashley Madison all over again. 
 Blackmailing users with the juiciest secrets, threatening to reveal their names. 
 This is a big payday. 
 Or go straight to the top... hold the Miafina site hostage. 
 But Quinn didn't do any of that. 
 The only thing that she did was delete her secret. 
 Users can delete their own confessions. 
 You'd only need to hack the site if you were deleting someone else's secret. 
 So maybe the confession we recovered wasn't Quinn's. 
 Use the lookback machine to track it. 
 Okay, it was posted November 18. 
 And deleted November 26. 
 Here's a screenshot of the confession as it appeared online. 
 Our confession was posted from the Paxton University campus on November 18, 5:17 A.M. 
 So it's possible a student at Paxton University was raped. 
 She used Miafina to threaten her rapist, then Quinn was hired to silence our rape victim. 
 A sexual assault victim at Paxton University posted this secret on November 18, threating the Red Zone. 
 The "Red Zone" as in football? 
 No. On college campuses, the "Red Zone" is the time in-between new student orientation and the Thanksgiving break, when students are at greatest risk for sexual assault. 
 So, instead of fixing the problem, they named it. 
 Incredible. 
 We need to find out who posted that secret. 
 All right, well, we can use Quinn's backdoor to get a list of all confessions with a Paxton University GeoTag. 
 I'll reach out to campus security, metro PD, cross-reference those confessions with reports of sexual assault on campus. 
 That might lead us to our victim. 
 Make sure they know this case stays under our jurisdiction. 
 Someone hired a hacker to cover up a rape. 
 We started this, we're gonna finish it. 
 I got it. 
 Hey, do you know what "S-O-T" means? 
 Yeah, "Screen on time"? 
 Amount of time your cell phone screen is lit up. 
 No, I don't think that's what this is. 
 I'm trying to figure out why Quinn hacked Miafina. 
 And this is the database of new words logged by the cell's dynamic dictionary. 
 And my phone finally stopped changing "Krummy" to "Tummy." 
 So? 
 So the last word that Quinn's phone learned was "SOT." 
 You search it? 
 Unless Quinn recently became a "sot" which is defined as a "habitual drunkard" or visited a village in Serbia named Sot, we're out of luck. 
 Okay. 
 So, let's write a script to search the phone's hard drive for the origin of "SOT." 
 Um... just put in that. 
 All right... 
 You miss being a black hat? 
 I miss the rush. 
 You know that moment right before you execute? 
 You have no idea what's gonna happen next? 
 I mean, the hacks I knew I shouldn't have been doing. 
 That was like... 
 s*x. 
 Oh, it was way better than s*x, come on now. 
 No. 
 I mean, not... not better than with you, just... right, like, in the abstract. 
 Uh-huh. Nice save. 
 What was your most dangerous hack? 
 I was living in New York. 
 I used to eat at this bomb Thai spot, right? 
 Called Thai Delight. 
 They had killer pad Thai. 
 Thing was no one was ever in this place. 
 So I was curious how they were paying their rent and they literally had no network security. 
 So I snuck a peek at their books. 
 Come to find out they were a front for the Thai Mob. 
 Now, the second I accessed the network, I had, like, six huge guys coming at me, right? 
 So, you know me, I'm fighting them off, one-by-one. 
 I took one of them... boom, threw him through a table... 
 Nelson, stop lying. 
 Yes, I did. 
 You ran! 
 Damn. 
 Faster than I ever did. 
 You're an idiot. 
 You know that's why you're so into me. 
 All right, now your turn. 
 What's your most dangerous hack? 
 I'm not telling. 
 Come on. 
 You can post on Miafina, but you can't share your secret with me? 
 See, I only read other people's confessions. 
 I never post. 
 So I called Paxton University to get a list of all sexual assault incidents reported on campus last year. 
 Their number was zero. 
 That is virtually impossible. 
 One in five young women are sexually assaulted in college. 
 Clearly they're under reporting to keep their crime stats down. 
 Protect their image. 
 It's despicable. 
 Avery? 
 Check it out... we figured out who hired Quinn to hack Miafina. 
 She started talking to someone with the handle SOT515 nine days ago on an encrypted messaging app. 
 There's their first conversation. 
 Quinn was hired to delete the confession we recovered. 
 And locate and spy on the person who posted it... Shelby Lockhart. 
 SOT515 is a rapist, who's searching for his victim. 
 We need to find Shelby before he does. 
 Go to their last conversation. 
 All right. 
 Maybe Quinn gave him Shelby's location. 
 Nothing like that, but... 
 Quinn quit working for SOT515. 
 She refused to continue to spy on Shelby. 
 Said that she was gonna tell the world what a disgusting, vile human being he is. 
 I mean, that's bold. 
 That is motive. 
 Quinn quit her hacking job. 
 She threatened to expose SOT515. 
 He may have killed Quinn. 
 And when he asked to meet Quinn in person, wanted to make a deal, Quinn agreed to meet him. 
 But hackers for hire never meet their client in person. 
 Maintaining anonymity is the cardinal rule of hacking. 
 I mean, come on, Quinn would never agree to a real-world meeting. 
 But she did. 
 We need to find out why she met with her killer in person. 
 I'll meet you in CTOC. 
 Nelson was right. 
 Quinn agreed to meet Mr. 515 the night that she was killed. 
 He's our prime suspect in this murder. 
 Where are we at with finding our rape victim Shelby Lockhart? 
 Her phone's been offline for a week. 
 No missing person reports on campus or with metro PD, but I have not been able to reach her parents. 
 Okay, well, this is what Shelby Lockhart looks like. 
 Her FriendAgenda has not been updated for over a week. 
 You think that 515 killed Quinn to keep her from exposing him, then went after Shelby Lockhart? 
 Until we find Shelby, that's our operating theory. 
 Still no info on SOT515. 
 I searched with and social media user with that handle. 
 I got nothing. 
 All right, this guy went through a lot of trouble to delete Shelby's confession, right? 
 Now, at first blush, it just looks like a cryptic poem. 
 But what about it made him go to such extremes? 
 Well, the guilty see evidence of their crime everywhere they look. 
 To him, this was broadcasting the rape. 
 Raven, can you enlarge Shelby's confession image? 
 So the images underneath the secrets are just as revealing as the text. 
 Why chose this picture? 
 It's pretty abstract. 
 I'm not sure it is. 
 Draws your eye upwards. 
 There's a structure. 
 Raven, can you rotate it 180 degrees? 
 Whoa, that's crazy. 
 Boats... SOT5! 
 Sprint of the Five Mile... look it up. 
 Okay, it's a row team race that happens once a year on the Five Mile River in Boston. 
 Yeah, happens in October. 
 This year the Paxton University crew team won the whole thing. 
 Hey, well, check it out. 
 They have a photo album of the celebration party. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Avery, is that Grace? 
 She's with her friend. 
 They must have gone to the celebration party. 
 Wait, stop, stop! Behind those guys standing at the pool table. 
 That painting is at the crew team house. 
 It's time we paid that crew a visit. 
 Paxton University crew team. 
 My name is Agent Mundo of the FBI. This is Deputy Director... 
 Ryan? Julian Perkins. 
 Paxton University Athletic Director. 
 Campus security alerted me to your visit. 
 You want to tell me what this is all about? 
 We have a warrant to search the crew team's electronic devices. 
 We have reason to believe one of them is a rapist and a murderer. 
 The assault victim is currently missing. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 You can't just come in here and make those kind of accusations. 
 Do you even have any proof? 
 It's an ongoing investigation. 
 You don't get to ask that question. 
 Who are you to say that? 
 Finn, that's enough. 
 Keep your mouth shut, okay? 
 I'll handle this. 
 This is not the first time that one of my athletes has been wrongly accused of sexual assault. 
 These lies ruin reputations. 
 Fewer than ten percent of all rape accusations are false. 
 That statistic, Agent Ryan, has nothing to do with these fine young men. 
 Not one of them is capable of rape or murder. 
 If you're so sure they're innocent, the devices will prove it. 
 You won't be taking their devices. 
 According to university counsel, their computers, phones, their tablets, they're all protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 
 They contain confidential student records. 
 We're not interested in their calculus scores. 
 We're looking for evidence in a criminal investigation. 
 As you know, the law's the law. 
 The only way you can have access to their devices is if you obtain consent or probable cause for an arrest. 
 Your warrant is useless. 
 We will find out what happened here. 
 You can't protect them forever. 
 I need to get access to the crew team's devices, Mason. 
 We need to get around this legal loophole. 
 I'm hunting a rapist. 
 It's not that simple, Avery. 
 I can't just get around a FERPA violation. 
 Obtaining university records is dicey territory. 
 Those devices contain the oarsmen's class schedules, university e-mails... they're protected. 
 The university is throwing up a wall to protect their image. 
 If we uncover that one of their golden oarsmen is a rapist and a murderer, it will tarnish their brand, and they know it. 
 You need the victim to file a complaint, okay? 
 Where is Shelby Lockhart? 
 We haven't been able to locate her. 
 Well, you don't have evidence that supports the arrest of any of the oarsmen. 
 That's the only way you're gonna get your hands on those devices. 
 How am I supposed to get evidence for an arrest if I'm not allowed to analyze those devices? 
 We're on the same side, Avery. 
 There's just no way to get around this. 
 All right, come on, Shelby, where are you? 
 Quinn was paid to locate Shelby. 
 There has to be some digital trail that'll lead us to her. 
 Hey, right here. 
 Where? 
 Quinn was using Blackshades to spy on Shelby. 
 It mirrored Shelby's phone onto Quinn's screen, allowing her to track Shelby's every move. 
 Everything Shelby typed, Quinn saw. 
 Check this out. 
 She wasn't only watching... 
 Quinn also injected targeted ads into Shelby's FriendAgenda feed. 
 She was replacing Shelby's targeted shopping ads with online sexual assault support groups. 
 And Quinn knew Shelby's secret. 
 I mean, she wanted to help, but she couldn't out herself as a hacker. 
 Quinn was Shelby's guardian angel. 
 All right. 
 So Shelby's phone has been offline for a week. 
 No phone service means the spyware can't track her. 
 Hold up. 
 The spyware didn't stop tracking Shelby's phone because it went offline. 
 The spyware forced it offline. 
 Quinn disabled Shelby's phone. 
 So her final act as guardian angel was to stop Shelby's rapist from being able to find her. 
 Shelby Lockhart is alive. 
 Her phone was inactive because Quinn disabled it. 
 Finally got ahold of her parents. 
 They just got back from a cruise. 
 They said that Shelby's old phone wasn't working, so she got a new phone and a new number. 
 Nelson's tracking it right now. 
 Good. 
 That was quick. 
 All right. We have an address. 
 Shelby, this is your confession on Miafina. 
 Why do you have this? 
 Whoever attacked you saw your confession. 
 He was looking for you. 
 Now I'm looking for him. 
 I should never have posted that. 
 It was stupid. 
 It wasn't stupid. 
 I thought if I posted it, that it'd make me feel better or... help me to move forward, or to go to the police, to tell someone else. 
 Anyone else. 
 Tell me, Shelby. 
 Who assaulted you? 
 There were three of them. 
 I can't remember their faces. 
 I never asked for their names. 
 Yeah, stop crying. 
 No! 
 I went to the party the weekend that the crew team won the Sprint of the Five Mile. 
 I had two drinks. 
 You know, they make them strong on purpose. 
 I went looking for the bathroom, and the next thing I remember is that painting. 
 They held me down to the pool table, and they pinned my arms back. 
 I realized my skirt was up. 
 No! 
 They took turns raping me. 
 Help me! 
 And I tried to tell them to stop. 
 I tried to fight them off, and... and then I just... just stared at that painting, and I prayed for it to be over. 
 I'm so sorry that happened to you. 
 Did you report your assault to anyone? 
 The university. 
 A few days after the party. 
 I went to see an administrator in the student life office. 
 And she said that the school takes incidents like this very seriously, but that I didn't have a good case, because... 
 ... because I couldn't remember their faces or their names, and because I was drunk, and because I didn't turn it in immediately. 
 That I was... I think she said... 
 Facing a hard fight. 
 My body was covered in bruises. 
 Why didn't you go to the police? 
 She told me not to. 
 She told me that I could lose my scholarship if I falsely accused the crew team of rape. 
 So then you left school. 
 I couldn't pretend that nothing had happened. 
 Every male face was my rapist. 
 I haven't told anyone else, not even my parents. 
 My sister doesn't even know, either. 
 She... she thinks I'm here just to help her move into her new place. 
 I had to get away. 
 I didn't think anyone would believe me. 
 I believe you. 
 And I'm gonna help you. 
 I promise. 
 Hello. 
 Your Title IX complaint against Paxton University, as requested. 
 Excellent. 
 Title IX requires a school maintain a campus free of sexual discrimination and violence. 
 I'm disgusted. Paxton broke the law when they dissuaded Shelby from filing a sexual assault complaint and threatened to revoke her scholarship. 
 They're supposed to make sure that assault victims can continue their education, not retaliate against them for reporting. 
 So if Paxton is found guilty of this violation, it'll hit them right where it hurts, their wallet. 
 Their federal funding can be revoked. 
 Good. 
 Then they won't be able to hide what's happening on campus anymore. 
 No one should go through what Shelby did. 
 One question: Why did you list yourself as the complainant and not Shelby Lockhart? 
 Anyone who believes there's been discrimination on the basis of s*x can file a complaint. 
 I would rather be the thorn in Paxton's side than have Shelby fight this battle, a battle that no university should be waging against a sexual assault victim to begin with. 
 Where do I sign? 
 Right there. 
 Excellent strategy. 
 If the university won't speak up for the students, we'll speak up for them ourselves. 
 That's it. 
 What? 
 We've been working this case from the top down. 
 There were hundreds of students at that party. 
 If the university won't stand up for Shelby, maybe another student will. 
 Is this about the other night? 
 I was just a little buzzed. 
 You were more than buzzed; you were drunk. 
 I need you to be careful. 
 I am being careful. 
 Good. 
 Do me a favor, download an app called Witness. 
 If you're ever in trouble, no matter what time of night, I want you to send me an alert with your location. 
 I will find you and help you. 
 Just promise me. 
 I promise. 
 Okay. 
 Avery, you could have texted me or even called me about this. 
 Is there something else? 
 Smart girl. 
 I'm working a case at Paxton. 
 There were photos on FriendAgenda of you and your friend Noah at the crew team's victory party. 
 Three members of the team sexually assaulted a young woman that night. 
 Do you know anything about it? 
 Did you see anything or hear anything? 
 What is it? 
 I don't... 
 I feel weird talking to you about this. 
 Grace, tell me. 
 Avery, you can't just throw around accusations like that. 
 You're defensive. Why? 
 Okay, look... 
 Noah is my boyfriend. 
 He transferred into Paxton last year because he was falsely accused of rape at his old school. 
 There was a police investigation. 
 It got a lot of press and everything, and then one month later, the girl recanted her story. 
 It was too late, you know. 
 He had to leave his university, his friends... take a year off to reapply. 
 It took him forever to trust anyone again, even me, when we started dating. 
 That's why you didn't introduce me the other night. 
 You're an FBI agent. 
 You know, I was afraid that you would look him up. 
 Everyone gets to decide whether he's guilty or innocent just by typing his name into a search engine without even knowing the facts. 
 That girl's lie will effect Noah for the rest of his life. 
 Well, what happened to Noah was terrible. 
 No one should go through that. 
 But as an FBI agent, I operate on a case-by-case basis, looking at the evidence that's right in front of me. 
 Grace, if you know anything about what happened at that party, you need to tell me. 
 I didn't see anyone get attacked, but I've heard the rumors. 
 There could be someone who saw something. 
 He was recording video at the party all night. 
 His name is Carter Harris. 
 Another student? 
 He's on the crew team. 
 Carter, this is not a code of silence you want to live the rest of your life with. 
 We know that you were documenting the Sprint of the Five Mile party. 
 We need that footage. 
 Well, you can't look at my phone without my consent. 
 You're right, we can't. 
 But you need to ask yourself what is more important: your team, or your integrity? 
 And what about Shelby Lockhart? 
 Listen, you're worried about betraying your boys. 
 I get it. 
 You train together year round, you compete all season, you party together every weekend. 
 You depend on each other. 
 It's an amazing brotherhood. 
 When you're part of a group like that, nobody sees you as an individual. 
 Is this who you want to be? 
 Come on, Carter, do the right thing. 
 I... I deleted the footage. 
 They told me to. 
 Here. Maybe you can recover the video. 
 Get that to Daniel Krumitz. 
 And what did you delete? 
 I don't... I... I'm not sure, really. 
 I caught it by mistake. 
 I was just... I was walking around the house, filming the party, and I accidentally walked in on them... uh, with Shelby. 
 Raping Shelby. 
 Who did you see? 
 I, uh, I can't be sure. 
 You said they told you to delete the footage. 
 Who is "They"? 
 Finn Thompson, Pete Winthrop and Thatcher Bell. 
 I was coming home from my last midterm and everybody in the house was freaking out. 
 One of the guys recognized the painting from the house when he was reading secrets on Miafina. 
 What happened then? 
 Finn made us all swear to keep our mouths shut. 
 Look, those guys are headed for the Olympics. 
 A rape charge would... ruin their lives. 
 Stop, please! 
 Please, stop! 
 All right! Pete Winthrop. 
 Finn Thompson. Thatcher Bell. 
 Stay. Everybody else, get out. 
 Stand up. 
 Hands out to your sides. 
 In case you've forgotten, Officer, you're not allowed to look at our phones. 
 It's "Agent," and you're under arrest for the aggravated sexual abuse of Shelby Lockhart. 
 With all due respect, Agent, we're the Paxton crew team. 
 We don't have to rape anyone. 
 Rape isn't about s*x. 
 It's about power. 
 And as a team, you operate as a pack. 
 This campus is your hunting ground. 
 Sorry, those a little tight? 
 Bad news. 
 None of their phones I.D. them as SOT515. 
 What? Are you sure? 
 Looks like someone else hired Quinn to cover up their crime. 
 Those three would've gone to someone else for help. 
 Their devices can still lead us to him. 
 I doubt they would've texted or called whoever it was for help. 
 No, you're right. 
 They would've gone in person. 
 And their phones would've been with them. 
 Frequent locations. 
 Carter gave Avery the date that the team saw Shelby's confession... last day of midterms. 
 That was, uh, right there. 
 November 19. 
 All right, so, other than their house and this facility, were their phones ever in the same place at the same time that day? 
 They were all in the same location for two hours: the athletic director's office, Julian Perkins. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, good. 
 You saved me a phone call. 
 The university attorney is on his way to get your search warrants tossed. 
 Those students will be back on campus within the hour. 
 I'm not here for your crew team. 
 I'm here for you. 
 I know that you're SOT515. 
 I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 I think you do. 
 Your precious crew team came to you with a problem: someone was accusing them of rape on the Miafina Web site. 
 They claimed they didn't do it, of course, but this silly girl was threatening to make up a story that they did. 
 And when they couldn't find her, she became a ticking time bomb for them and for you. 
 That is quite the detailed fabrication, Agent Ryan. 
 It's the truth, Mr. Perkins. 
 There's a funny thing about guilt. 
 It traps people into reacting. 
 The irony is, if your team members had just left it alone, you could've gotten away with all of it. 
 The only ones who knew what Shelby's confession really meant were the guilty. 
 But then, when Quinn Elliot went rogue, that's when you had everything to lose. 
 Your glory over the Sprint of the Five Mile. 
 The money and the prestige that win brought this university. 
 Your job. 
 So you asked Quinn to meet with you in person to work out a deal. 
 This is absurd. 
 I have no idea who Quinn is. 
 And I had no idea why she agreed to meet with you in person, but then her phone told me why. 
 She launched her video camera app. 
 She planned on recording your meeting to expose you. 
 She knew that you were capable of covering up rape, but she didn't know that you were capable of murder. 
 Julian Perkins, you are under arrest for the murder of Quinn Elliot. 
 I never thought they'd be punished, let alone this. 
 First thing we need to do is get you into a survivor's group. 
 Then get you back into school. 
 I don't know. 
 I'm the girl who got the crew team suspended. 
 I'm the girl who lost the school the Sprint of the Five Mile. 
 People are gonna hate me. 
 Shelby... none of this is your fault. 
 They lost that title all by themselves. 
 But by coming forward, you're protecting every other young woman on this campus. 
 You're exposing an ugly truth that is occurring on universities across the country. 
 Title IX requires that the university keep you safe from retaliation. 
 I'm gonna make sure they do. 
 I don't want to be known as "The rape victim" on campus. 
 Unfortunately, this is an epidemic. 
 And the reality is, everywhere you go on campus, you will be surrounded by other women who've experienced sexual violence. 
 Women like you. 
 You're not alone. 
 And while you're a victim, you're also a survivor. 
 Look, this is just the beginning. 
 You still need to go through trial, you need to testify... 
 I'm not gonna sugarcoat this. 
 It's not going to be easy, but when it is over, you will be glad that you did. 
 And I'm gonna be there for you every step of the way. 
 'Cause I've got your back. 
 Thank you. 
 You're seriously not gonna tell me your most dangerous hack? 
 I told you mine. 
 Listen, honestly, I have too many to choose from. 
 Okay. 
 Mr. James. Thanks for coming in. 
 We want to tell you something about your wife. 
 Haven't I heard enough? 
 She wasn't who she said she was. 
 Maybe not. 
 Your wife wasn't killed because she was hacking. 
 She was killed because she stopped. 
 She died protecting the young woman she was hired to hack. 
 Your wife was a hero. 
 I wish I could be sure that's the truth. 
 I don't know what to believe anymore. 
 Hackers are secretive by nature. 
 But our devices know more about us than anyone in our lives. 
 "Us." 
 You're a... 
 A hacker. Yeah. 
 We both are. 
 Former black hats. 
 Lexie's phone told us she was turning her life around. 
 Why do you keep calling her Lexie? 
 Your boss told me that her real name is Quinn. 
 Because of this. 
 This is Quinn's last job. 
 Then I will live only as Lexie. 
 I owe it to him to be the wife he thinks he married. 
 What is this? 
 Lexie's secret. 
 It's a confession she posted as Lexie James. 
 She was done living a double life. 
 She wanted to put Quinn behind her. 
 She was choosing me. 
 You gave her a reason to change. 
 Nothing can bring your wife back. 
 But this might be able to help. 
 It's a zero day exploit for ToggleFly. 
 Allows a hacker to steal login information from the users. 
 Lexie found it. 
 Companies pay hackers who find bugs in their systems. 
 It's completely legal and it's worth a lot of money. 
 And it's yours. 
 A gift from Quinn. 
 Lexie.
