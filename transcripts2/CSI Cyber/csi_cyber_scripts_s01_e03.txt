 My name is Avery Ryan. 
 I was a victim of cyber crime. 
 Like you, I posted on social media, checked my bank account balance online, even kept the confidential files of my psychological practice on my computer. Then I was hacked, and as a result, one of my patients was murdered. 
 My investigation into her death led me to the FBI, where I joined a team of cyber experts to wage a war against a new breed of criminal hiding on the Deep Web... infiltrating our daily lives in ways we never imagined... faceless... nameless... lurking inside our devices, just a keystroke away. Hi. ♪ ♪ Surprised I could get a ZoGo at this crazy hour. You guys still taking the online coupon? (alarm blaring) Hey, what'd you say your name was again? I didn't. (horn blaring) Hey, listen, I think maybe there's been a mix-up. Can you turn around? Change of plans. You can just pull over and-and just let me out. Hey, what are you doing? Why are we stopping here? Hey! Help! Somebody help me! (screaming) (screaming stops) (elevator bell dings) Elijah. Hey, I hear you're traveling to Boston with us. Yeah, when a government contractor with top secret clearance is murdered, alarm bells go off all over Washington. Attorney general's called me five times today. Cade Matthews' body dumped near the Riverway. According to Boston PD, his cell found at the scene was wiped along with all other devices at his home and his office. Have a look. Mundo : Consultant for private military company. Derongard. Specialized in cyber security. Oh, the ultimate white hat. Bet he had a lot of data worth killing for. (phone rings) Attorney general again. So the target murders Cade, steals his government secrets and then wipes his devices clean to remove any trace of the intrusion. That's a smart move. Clean up a crime scene with bleach after the kill. Everything in here should recover the wiped info from the vic's devices, okay? Just plug it in. I already know all this, Krumitz. (sighs) This is a big case. I should be coming with you to Boston. No, you should be taking one of your 500 vacation days and not working. I can't stay at home. I got to stay busy; I got to do something. But you are all right? Yeah, I'm good. Come on, you're gonna be late. Ah! So, Krummy, you finally decided to take a page out of my book. I mean, your tie could use a little work, though. (elevator bell dings) Just saying, I'm digging it. Look, everybody's dressing up today. Looks like you had fun last night. Who's the lucky guy? Not in the mood, Nelson. Ryan : Raven, check the social media activity for our Boston murder victim, Cade Matthews. See if we can build a pattern of behavior prior to his death. Shall we? Yeah. Since when do you wear a tie? Says the girl in the party dress? Had a mix-up with ZoGo this morning. Couldn't get a car and didn't want to be late. Well, looks like it's you and me, Krumitz. Let's take over the world. Detective Linney. Crime Scene recovered Mr. Matthews' phone at the scene. Left it for you cyber guys to handle. Thank you, Detective. You got any guess as to what we're looking at here? Well, you know, we're a little early in the investigation even for speculations. Yeah, of course. It's just that it's kind of personal for the whole department. Cade Matthews was one of the cyber security experts to help us locate the Boston Marathon bombers. He stayed with us all night. He was... One of the best consultants we had here at Derongard. How long have you known Mr. Matthews? Uh, Cade and I have worked together very closely for the last two years. And how long have you been dating? You just referred to him by his first name. You told me that you worked closely together. I only asked how long you've known him. Regina, you're his boss. An office romance might make other employees nervous, insecure, or feel threatened. No one else knew. Cade thought that they did, but he was just being... Paranoid. That's how I'd describe him. He said that he didn't like having the information that he did, and that rival companies could possibly be coming after him for it. Did he tell you what kind of information he was talking about? Cade was consulting on 15 classified projects for the military and NASA. I didn't even know all the details. When was the last time you saw him? A week ago. Last night. He ended the relationship. Said it was inappropriate. Did you kill him? No. I loved him. Excuse me. Coroner confirmed C.O.D.-- asphyxiation. He was strangled. There were signs of a struggle, some odd skin abrasions they think were due to a stun gun. They also recovered a small children's toy block that was in his mouth. A message from the killer. What was the letter? A number. Two. Okay, so let me get this straight. You jump on to moving trains, you kick down doors, and you know computer forensics? You're like a badass Bill Gates, just younger. And not as rich. (chuckles) All right, the data from Cade's work computer was backed up by the Derongard servers. It's recoverable. Wait a minute. Is this right? What? The target didn't wipe Cade's devices like we thought. Looks like Cade remotely wiped them himself before he was murdered. There's evidence of a text-enabled kill switch on his cell. (screaming) This wasn't a killer trying to get rid of a digital trace. This was a victim protecting confidential information. Yeah. Cellebrite just recovered the files from his phone. Now let's see. The last thing Cade did before he died was access the ZoGo app, Right. destroy his files, and dial 911. Raven, I'm gonna need you to dig up a recording of a 911 phone call from Cade Matthews' cell phone at 5:25 this morning. Operator : 911, what's your emergency? Cade : Hi, I'd like to order a pizza. Large. Uh, pepperoni, extra pepperonis. Sir, you dialed the police. Yeah, I'm not home right now. Are you guys still good to deliver? Sir, this is an emergency line. Are you having an emergency? He was trying to get help. Yeah, according to the operator, she didn't get the location of his cell before the call disconnected. Well, based on tower signals, we can triangulate a rough area, but it's a pretty large section of the city, nowhere near the body dump site. We do know he ordered a ZoGo at 5:17 a.m. What do we know about his ZoGo driver? Huh. Well, this is weird. According to Cade's account,  five different drivers picked him up. Well, he couldn't have been in five different cars all at the same time. So which car did he get in? That's impossible. No one passenger could be assigned five drivers for a single trip. Mundo : Well, Cade Matthew's ZoGo profile suggests otherwise. Well, we did experience a glitch in the system last night. Um, we ran a check and we rebooted the entire system along the Eastern Seaboard. That could easily explain the confusion. There were several complaints and a couple missed rides. No, you were hacked. At 5:10 a.m., to be exact. Looks like a hacker wrote a script that took the unique identifier of the passenger's phone and bounced it to five separate drivers. So we don't know who picked up Cade. Target turned the ZoGo system into a shell game so he could hide himself. I'm gonna need the last names of those five drivers. I can't give you those names. I think maybe you're missing my point, Derrick. Those five drivers are suspects in a murder. A man is dead, and the last thing he did was use ZoGo. I can't give you the names because they're not our drivers. They're independent contractors who use our service. We just supply the app. You take a cut of the fare. You're the transportation company. No, we are not responsible nor are we liable for any transportation services provided by the drivers. That is clearly stated in our terms of service agreement. (scoffs) We are a software company that links drivers to passengers. We provide an app; we're an idea company. An idea company? How about that? Yeah. Here's an idea. How about you take a closer look at some of your Yelp reviews. Yeah, you have over 50 negative reviews, which claims that your drivers are offering drugs to their passengers. We do background checks. Beyond that, we are not responsible for what the drivers do in their own vehicles. Oh, well, according to the FBI database, at least a dozen ZoGo drivers have criminal records, including felony convictions for drug dealing. And if you had actually run background checks, you'd know that. So, here's another idea. Before you lie again to a federal agent, how about you get me the names of those drivers? I'll see what I can do. This is exactly why I take a taxi. Man, I use ZoGo all the time. It's cheaper than a cab. Look, pay right on your phone, get in, get out. Tip's included in the price. Is murder extra? Did Raven learn anything from Cade Matthews' social media profile? Very little. He only clocked a few hours online a week. He rarely texted or posted, and last night was the first time he'd ever taken a ZoGo. Spoke to all five ZoGo drivers. They all claim they didn't pick up Cade Matthews. Nelson : So, we accessed their personal cell phones, which also tracks their movement. All five drivers were nowhere near where Cade was picked up. Yeah, and all the devices were clean. They were not hacked in any way. Which mean all five drivers have a verified digital alibi. The ZoGo system was wrong. Right before he died, he got a message sent to his ZoGo app saying that his ride was  canceled because he was a no-show. Guys, if he wasn't in a ZoGo, where was he? Ghost car. Our target hacked the app. Diverted all the data onto his cell phone. Masqueraded as a ZoGo driver. Cade got in his car thinking it was a real ZoGo. You know, ZoGo has made it socially acceptable to just get in the car with a stranger. At least taxis are regulated. There's accountability. No, not with this app. You get in that car, you're playing Russian roulette. Bet you Cade didn't ask for the driver's name. Probably didn't compare the face to the photo on the app. I rarely check the face on the app with the driver. Yeah, well, that blind faith is gonna get you in trouble some day, Nelson. You know what? I'm gonna think twice about that. I just see the logo on the car window and I assume  it's my ZoGo, so... Well, the psychology makes sense. Cade was a first-time ZoGo user. Unlike Nelson, he didn't know better. A car arrived at his location. It looked like a ZoGo. He trusted the app. He didn't question it. This technology may have made life easier. It sure has not made it safer. Cade Matthews learned that one the hard way. He's dead because the technology is so hackable. The killer used the ZoGo system as a disguise so he could commit murder. But how did he know Cade Matthews needed a ride at that exact time? He didn't. It was a random kill. Cade happened to be the unlucky victim who climbed into the killer's fake ZoGo during the glitch. And Cade panicked once he was in the car because he thought the driver was after his confidential information. That's when he wiped the files. Two. The child's block in Cade Matthews' mouth was the number two-- as in second. Not first. Somewhere out there, there's another victim. Number one. A victim that hasn't been found yet. Guys, I hate to state the obvious, but, uh... three, four, five. Our target is a serial killer using ZoGos to find his prey. ♪ CSI Cyber 1x03 ♪

♪ Oh, yeah. ♪ So, what are we looking at here? Our killer's M.O. is very specific. Everything he does is calculated. It has a purpose. Detective, can we have access to all your missing person files? Any cases with even a hint of similarity to Cade Matthews' murder? All right. Check this out. Network diagnosis shows that a glitch occurred in the system three days ago. 5:10 a.m.? Yeah. That's the same glitch at the exact same time as this morning. A pattern. And that glitch created the perfect window of opportunity to kill his first victim three days ago. Why can't I pick you up? Francine, it will be easier if we go together. Fine. Okay? Fine. Meet me there, but don't be late. Because you're always late. And don't forget to bring a photo I.D. Everything okay? You seem flustered. I'm good. So... three days ago, 122 people in Boston ordered a ZoGo pickup between 5:10 and 5:45 a.m. Looks like the map glitch led to a lot of cancelations. And annoyed customers like myself. Yeah, but did anyone go missing? I cross-referenced all 122 clients with missing person reports. Nothing showed up. But still... it could be someone out there they haven't found yet. That's a sad thought. Happens all the time. People don't give a second thought to someone they haven't seen in a couple days or... friend or family who hasn't e-mailed back or texted. What's wrong, Krumitz? Stay focused, Raven. Avery believes there's another body out there. And we have to find it. Our target's first victim would've ordered a ZoGo. Starting there, let's just narrow down our list. Using the ZoGo passenger database, we can eliminate anyone in Boston who ordered a ZoGo pickup after the glitch was fixed three days ago. I get it. We're eliminating people who are still alive. So that means we can eliminate anyone who posted on social media in the last few days. Uh-huh. That leaves us with 27 people. That's not bad. All we got to do is call each one... Wait. ZoGo patrons' credit cards are linked on the accounts. They may not have ordered a ZoGo, but if there was recent activity on their cards, that would suggest that they're alive and well. Nice! Check that. Melissa Drake. And that's her cell number. She ordered a ZoGo at the same time Cade Matthews did-- 5:17 a.m. (line ringing) She's not answering the cell phone attached on her profile. Melissa Drake. Where are you? Melissa was picked up at 5:17 a.m. from her home at 932 North Croft Avenue, Bay Village. But no one reported her missing. Her family and friends think she's out of the country on vacation; they didn't expect to hear from her. She ordered a car to the airport, was a no-show at the hotel. So, more than likely, Melissa never even made it out of Boston. We have to find her so we can establish a link between our two victims. God, can I just stay optimistic here, and hope she's in an airport bar somewhere? Based on the M.O. of Cade Matthews' killer, Cade was picked up at 5:17 a.m. like Melissa Drake. And he was killed in the car within ten minutes. Now, most killers don't want to drive around for longer than 20 minutes with a dead body in their car. And he'd avoid bridges and tunnels because traffic jams and accidents prevent an easy escape. That gives us a search area of approximately two miles in any direction. If the body was dumped three days ago and we haven't found it yet, it means it's off the beaten path. (sirens wailing) (tires screech) (indistinct radio transmission) Hope you don't mind me asking, but how'd you know there was a body down here? It's, uh, it's kind of what we do. Melissa Drake. All right, ligature marks around her neck. Petechial hemorrhage in her eyes. Both Cade and Melissa were strangled. Number one. You got something? Sure did. Every intrusion leaves digital dust, right? Yeah, like fingerprints at a crime scene. Just takes time to find it. I figured if I could uncover how the target got into the ZoGo network, I can find the dust to track him. Right. So I accessed the journaling system on the server and scanned all the inbound e-mails. And I did find one that was sent to every employee. “Free tax review. Beat the deadline.” He got in through a simple phishing attack? He knew somebody'd open the file attached to that e-mail. Nelson :  It was the secretary. As soon as she opened it up-- blam! Malware onto the ZoGo network. Sifter :  So, our target sent out an e-mail to the ZoGo employees, it spread malware, infected the entire system and allowed the target to pose as a driver and commit two murders? Yeah. All right. Get Krumitz and Raven to trace the origin of that phishing e-mail. Okay, I'm on it. I checked the Internet headers on the e-mail with the malware, and found an IP address. Wait, whoever e-mailed this malware didn't bother to scrub their headers? Apparently not. Well, it doesn't make sense. Who's tech savvy enough to inject malware into the ZoGo server...? Krumitz, we've got a physical address. Just call Avery and Elijah. Right. 
 
 Looking for Patrick Murphy. Man : Hey, Murphy, I want to talk to you about... We got a runner! Officer : Police! Get down on the ground! Get down! Get down! Freeze! (grunting) Patrick Murphy! Nice to meet you. You're under arrest. Murphy : Just because I drove a black car doesn't mean I'm guilty. Mundo : You're right, it doesn't. What makes you guilty is your I.P. address was used to send a phishing e-mail. Your motive is your cab company's been hemorrhaging clients to ZoGo. We found two bodies in your area of operation. You're looking at a double homicide. “A double homicide”?! (stammers) I didn't kill anybody. I sent e-mails into ZoGo. Like a fake coupon to piss off their customers. Deliver a little business back to me. Yeah. I didn't even send it-- I had to hire a guy to send it for me! You've been vandalizing ZoGo-- slashing tires, harassing drivers for the past six months. I hate ZoGo, okay? I want to drive them out of Boston. But that doesn't mean I want to kill anybody over it. I sank my entire life savings into this taxi company. And then these punks from San Francisco create an app. Suddenly, anybody off the street can be a driver. How am I supposed to feed my family, huh? You tell me that. How old's your daughter? 15? 16? Yeah, 15. Ryan : Got glitter paint on his cuticles. Lots of arts and crafts. Your daughter's a cheerleader? Look at his license plate frame. “Go Spartans”" Now, tell me, did you keep any of her childhood toy blocks? Toy blocks? He's not our guy. Nelson :  We've got nothing so far. Taxi driver was a dead end. Coupon had nothing to do with the murders. Back to square one. Anything on your side, Krummy? Checked out ZoGo's firewall. It stopped 15 separate attacks in the last two weeks. But here's the odd thing. The attacks stopped three days ago. Wow, that's when ZoGo had its first glitch. That's when our first victim died. Right, why would the attacks stop, though? I mean, did the target just give up? No, since he couldn't penetrate the ZoGo firewall, he got into the system, just not remotely. He infiltrated them from within. A Trojan horse. Not like the virus, like the Trojan War. He infiltrated the HQ. Yeah, that's not easy to do. Yeah, but it's also not impossible. There's a few ways you can do it. My first approach-- tailgate in with the returning lunch crowd, take the flash drive with the malware on it, place it somewhere in the lobby. Someone's gonna pick it up, plug it in, to see whose it is. Option two-- walk in with the evil twin router, give it right to the receptionist at the front desk. Uh, hey, wait a minute. There's no Josh Hayes here. Uh, must be new. Just, uh, check the system again. Now your evil twin router's gonna pose like a trusted network, tricking all the employee's devices into connecting to it, and then eavesdropping on their traffic. Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm. I'll buy that. Mundo :  We're looking for an evil twin router. It's a wireless device that doesn't belong. Yes, I know what it is. I run a tech startup. Great-- then let us run this investigation. Got it. You see this router here? Yeah. It's different than all the others on ZoGo's network. Confirmation our target is using an evil twin router. Yeah, and according to ZoGo's employee records, five employees are on vacation. Any one of them could have received the package. It would still be on their desk. Susan Waters? Yep. Wow. That's nice work. Mundo : No, no, hold on-- you plug into that thing, the target's gonna know we're on to him-- he could flee. Yeah, and if we don't plug in, we can't run a diagnostics on it and get an I.P. address for our target. All right. Go for it. All right. (pounding on door) Mundo :  Richard Davis, FBI! Clear. Man : South bathroom is clear! Man 2 : Back all clear! Man 3 : Side all clear! Hey, Avery. You're gonna want to see this. Ryan : Michael. Sweet boy. “Hit-and-run kills unidentified seven-year-old boy.” Ryan : Let me guess, a ZoGo driver. That was six months ago. At 5:17 a.m. Looks like the driver fled the country, avoided charges. And the police dismissed the case against ZoGo. Makes for one very pissed off father who snapped. Oh, boy. Four, five, six, seven. The one and two children's blocks were our first two victims. Three is missing. We might already be too late. I knew you'd be late. Hey, I'm actually right on time. You always tell me to be somewhere 15 minutes before I actually have to be there. Yeah, because you're always late. Look, I just came here to tell you, I can't do this, Daniel. What? It makes me feel bad. All the horrible memories start coming back. I get bad dreams. Just... I'm done. Francine, you have to do it. Why? You're gonna make me go in there alone? You don't have to do it, either, okay? It's been 17 years. Look, Francine, you're already here. Just do it-- it'll be over before you know it. Are you even listening to me? I don't want to do this. I miss them too much. It hurts too much to remember. Look, I know this sounds real horrible, but I want to forget what happened, Daniel. I'll never forget what happened. ♪ ♪ Raven, what did you get at the DMV? A black 2013 Camry registered to Richard Davis. Massachusetts license-- Five-Mary-Victor-Nora-one-one. Does that car have a navigation system? Checking. Yes. It has a satellite GPS system. All right, run the GPS-- see if you can get a location. I've got his car. Looks like it's parked at 634 Elm Street in Charlestown. Sending the map to you right now. Attagirl. Elijah, I have a job for you! Davis' car is parked one block east of us. Take SWAT. On my way. ♪ ♪ Woman : Court is in session, please be seated. (gavel slams) I was ten years old when Taylor Pettis shot and killed my parents in that convenience store that night. I was... ten years old when... I broke the news to my grandmother that her only son had died. I was just a kid. Today I'm 28. And I thought that by now, I'd be capable of forgiveness. That maturity would lessen the pain. But I was wrong. I still miss my mom and dad. They never got to see what I became. I never got to make them proud. That man destroyed my life. He not only took my parents away, but because of him, I lost my best friend-- my sister, Francine. We don't laugh together anymore. But why would we? He shattered our childhood. He crushed our souls. And for that, Taylor Pettis should never be freed. Mundo : Richard Davis left us a picture of a man's hand and a toy block. Is the man dead? Can't tell. Richard Davis is toying with us. The placement of the block doesn't fit the pattern. He hasn't killed yet. Something in him wants us to stop him. Well, he got kicked off of ZoGo. He'll have to create a new account, right? There's no way he can beat the intrusion detection system and a layer-three firewall. And no time to set up a new evil twin router. Well, he knows we're on to him. Well, he's not done yet. His message is clear-- he will kill someone else at 5:17. But he can't pick up any passengers unless he's a registered driver in their system. No, he doesn't have to be a registered driver-- he could open a new account. As a passenger. ♪ ♪ It's 5:00 a.m. We have less than half an hour to get Richard Davis in cuffs before he attempts another killing at 5:17 a.m. Krumitz is working on narrowing our target's location. Let's roll. Okay, we need to narrow this down to one rider and fast. What do we know? We blew up the target's ZoGo profile. If he's taking a ride right now, he's doing it with a new account. Okay, so we're looking for an active passenger traveling on a newly created account. Leaves 37. But you can't get a ride without an active credit card. And he's not using his own. Prepaid credit card. You can pick one up in any drugstore, no questions asked. We're still looking at 19 possibilities. Richard Davis ditched his phone in his car. If he ordered a ZoGo, he would need a phone with the app loaded onto it. He needed a new cell phone. One activated in the last three hours. Yes. Now let's see what ZoGo driver picked him up. We can track him using the driver's cell's GPS. Ramirez : I'll link everyone to this map. Richard Davis is in a ZoGo six blocks south of us heading west. (tires squealing) Hang on. The ZoGo's still en route. Our killer hasn't pounced yet. All right, let's get there before he does. Nelson, do you have imaging coordinates? Got them. Backup's on the move. Wait, wait, suspect just turned. He's heading south toward Boston Common. You sure this is the right way, man? Just keep going. Now how about you throw that cell phone out the window? I can't have you calling anybody. We just lost the signal. Richard Davis must be on to us. We need to find a way to track him. Nelson, find a cell catcher. It'll grab any cell signal in a one-mile radius. Okay, but didn't the driver's cell phone die? We're not tracking the driver's cell. We're tracking Richard Davis' burner cell. We'll track the IMEI number and get the current coordinates. Work fast. If he gets out of your range, we won't get there in time. (horn blaring) Faster. You need to go faster. That'll just bring attention to us, man. I didn't ask you. Now floor it. Cell catcher is up and running. It shouldn't take long to get a hit. As long as our killer has his cell phone on. Got it. Yes. Target's moving south through downtown and fast. He's almost out of range. If he gets any further ahead, he's gone. Sifter, we need to slow him down. Avery, I know what you're asking, and it's complicated. We're gonna have to wake up a magistrate judge on duty and get a title three emergency. We don't have time for that. Oh, screw it. I'll apologize later. What's a title three? We're gonna change a few traffic lights. All right, I'm gonna call Raven. Tell Raven we're headed north towards Beacon Hill. Krumitz :  Careful, Raven. Don't trigger the CMU. I know, I got it. Just like riding a bike. I hacked into the Boston SCADA system, and we now have complete control of every traffic light in the greater metropolitan area. That's an awful lot of power. Stay on task, Raven. Not the time to slip your black hat back on. I know, I know. Let's throw our target some roadblocks, show him where we want him to go. Nothing but red? No, no, not red. Green. Green causes the most chaos. (horns blaring) Looks like he got caught in traffic. Thank you, Raven. (horns continue) (sirens approaching) What do you want me to do, man? He's caught in the same gridlock we are. He can't be that far ahead. Let's go. (horns continue) (drivers shouting indistinctly) Man : Get back in your car! Stay in your cars! (gunshots, screaming) FBI! Stop! Get down! Get down! (gunshot) Stay in your vehicles. (gunshots, screaming) (tires squealing) Ryan : Richard Davis! Freeze! Mundo : FBI! Drop the gun! Richard, you don't have to do this. (indistinct radio transmission) They didn't care about my son. They have to pay for that. What happened to your son was tragic. Horrible. But killing random innocent people is no solution. He was my only child. Someone has to pay. I'm coming out. Richard. I understand exactly what you're going through. That ache that you feel like will never go away. I saw a picture of Michael. Richard. Think about how sweet he was. How he would never want to hurt anybody. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey, we did good in Boston. Hey. My SWAT vest still fits. Next time I'm getting my hands dirty. (chuckles) What? I just... (sighs) I don't know, I mean, if anything ever happened to Michelle, like if somebody hurt her, I don't know, I might become Richard Davis. I know you. You are no Richard Davis. Where's Krumitz? I just got us shots. He had to take a phone call. Oh, shots, huh? Pulling another all-nighter? It wasn't an all-nighter, it was a date. Well, a date that lasted until 6:00 in the morning. It was a good date. Krumitz, finish your story. You were telling us about how your parole hearing went today? Yeah, um... I'm sorry. Uh, I got to go. Krumitz, you okay? Whoa, Daniel, Daniel, what is it? That was the prosecutor. They released Taylor Pettis an hour ago. He's a free man. Daniel, you need to know you did everything you could. I figured he'd get out of jail someday, but I didn't think it would be today. Whatever you need, bud... we're here for you. Sifter : Krumitz, you're not alone. I'm sorry, man. But, you know, Batman lost his parents, too. (chuckles softly) You're Batman, Krummy. Be Batman. Does that make you Robin? No, I'm-I'm not Robin. (laughter, chattering)
