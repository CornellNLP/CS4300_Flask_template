 My name is Avery Ryan.  I was a victim of cyber crime.  Like you, I posted on social media, checked my bank account balance online, even kept the confidential files of my psychological practice on my computer. Then I was hacked, and as a result, one of my patients was murdered.  My investigation into her death  led me to the FBI, where I joined a team of cyber experts to wage a war against a new breed of criminal hiding on the Deep Web... infiltrating our daily lives in ways we never imagined... faceless... nameless... lurking inside our devices, just a keystroke away.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Jordan, any news? 
 What? 
 Okay, slow down. 
 Send me the photo. 
 It's gonna be okay. We're gonna find her. 
 "I'm sorry, Dad. Don't know what else to do. It's all too much. I love you. Good-bye." 
 Krumitz, I'm sending you a photo. 
 I need you to get the GPS coordinates for the metadata. 
 Man :  Avery, the photo Zoey Tan sent to her father was taken in Rock Creek Park. 
 (helicopter blades whirring) 
 (garbled radio transmission) 
 (garbled radio transmission) 
 According to GPS coordinates from the photo that Zoey sent her father, it was taken here in Rock Creek-- this specific area. 
 We've got three search units covering the four square miles and another in the zoo adjacent to the park. 
 Keep your phone on. Mmm. 
 Jordan. 
 Breathe. 
 If she's here, we'll find her. 
 I can't remember if I told Zoey "I love you" the last time I saw her. 
 I keep replaying it through my head. I... 
 I grabbed my coffee, I handed her money for lunch, I... 
 I think I kissed her on the forehead. I just... I just can't remember what I said. You're a wonderful father. I've seen so myself. Zoey adores you. She knows you love her. Well, raising a daughter on your own, I just... (dog barking) Zoey? Zoey? Zoey! Jordan, wait! (barking) Jordan : Zoey! Ryan : Wait! (barking) Jordan : I'm absolutely sure that's Zoey's phone. I bought her that case for Christmas. Battery's dead. It'll take a second. You think she's still in the park? My teams are continuing the search. I'll keep you posted. Do you know Zoey's password? No, I never asked for it. I... I let Zoey have her privacy. It'll take us a minute to unlock it. (phone ringing) It's Zoey. Baby? Are you okay? Where are you? Zoey? Zoey. Hello? Does Zoey have another cell phone? Not that I know of. Well, this phone wasn't calling you. Call it back. (ringing) What the hell? Is that possible? Only if it's a cyber intrusion. Zoey's phone was spoofed. (garbled radio transmission) Mundo : Just spoke to Detective Garcia. He's still running point on the search, but it's our case now. Any new evidence of Zoey in the area? Besides the phone? Not yet. They've searched 30% of the park. We've extended the perimeter, but so far, no sign of a struggle or foul play. You think she's still alive? Well, the text was definitive, but we haven't found a body yet. Are we, uh... ruling out the father as a suspect? Well, I know Jordan. He would never harm his daughter. Listen, I know he's your friend, but... Elijah, I was Jordan's therapist. We stayed in contact after I lost my practice. He came to me for grief counseling when his wife, Annette, passed away. Zoey is his life. There's no doubt in my mind. Jordan had nothing to do with this. All right. I'm gonna head to their house. Collect the rest of Zoey's devices. Oh, Elijah... I know it was your morning to take Michelle to school. Thank you for being here. Grandpa was thrilled to get the time with her, believe me. It's important to you. I wouldn't be anywhere else. So, uh, thank you all for coming by. Uh, there is no news. Like I said, Zoey is still missing. I've extended my guidance counseling hours for anyone who might have information or just wants to talk one-on-one about Zoey's disappearance. Jordan, please keep us updated. And let me know if there's anything I can do. Thank you. Thank you all. Man : Call if you need anything. Woman : Let us know if you need anything. School administrators? I know they mean well, but it's like they're expecting the worst. I mean, could Zoey have been suicidal and I just didn't see it? Did you notice any significant behavioral changes? Emotional instability, overwhelming sadness, anger, hopelessness? No, no. There was nothing like that. I mean, Zoey was... Zoey is a typical moody teenager. But she's getting straight "A"s. Scored well on her SATs. I thought she was happy. (sighs) I mean, I'm her father, how did I miss this? Zoey was either really clumsy or she took out some serious aggression on this poor tablet. Whoa. There are no pictures anywhere in here. It's like she didn't have any friends. That's cute. You think teenagers still print out photos. That's what social media is for. What are picture frames for? Parents. Grandparents. You know... old people. I would get mad at you, but I walked myself right into that one. (laughs) Whoa. Did you see that? Yeah. That's weird. It's like someone moved the mouse, except neither one of us did. First her phone, now her computer. Somebody is controlling Zoey's devices. And we're gonna find you. What have we got? You were right about Zoey's phone being spoofed. But cool thing is how it was spoofed. Wait for it... (phone ringing) Oh, let me guess: Nelson is not the person calling me. Krumitz : That's right. I am. I made that call through a spoofing Web site that anyone with an Internet connection has access to. There's over a dozen sites like this. But the good news is, that I had to input my office number to make that call just now, so these sites should have a record of those inputs. That was... that was a good one. It was. (laughs) But, uh... I think gotcha beat. I went back and looked at the metadata on the photo that Zoey texted her dad. It was taken at Rock Creek Park. Just not this morning. Four months ago. Zoey didn't take that photo with her phone, she took it with her digital camera. But most importantly, the photo never existed on Zoey's cell. If she didn't have it on her phone, how did she send it? Well, that's the thing. I went through 972 photos on Zoey's cell. Photo wasn't there. I mean, I checked e-mails... Nothing. Then I went to look for the text that she sent her dad this morning. See... there's no way she sent that text. I mean, Zoey's phone died on Friday at 11:10 p.m. It wasn't turned on until you plugged it in this morning around 9:00 a.m. But the text was sent to Zoey's dad two hours before that, at 7:12 a.m. Krumitz : So someone else sent that text to Jordan through a spoofing Web site. Ryan : That still leaves one important question. Where is Zoey Tan? Boy, Zoey was all the parents could talk about at drop-off this morning. Does your son, Aaron, know her? He knows her name. He's seen her on campus. Not much else. She's in the grade above him. So where do we stand on this? Both the text and call to Jordan's cell originated from a spoofing site. So all we've got is a suicide text and just... hope that Zoey's still alive. All right. Keep me posted. When we collected the devices from Zoey's room, someone was watching us through  the camera on her laptop. Zoey's laptop is infected with a malware that allows the device to connect with and control it. A backdoor Trojan. Exactly. And I found a foreign I.P. address in her network logs. We're running it down now. Ramirez : We may not know who, but I think I know why she was being spied on. I made a cluster graph of the social media response to Zoey's disappearance. On multiple platforms. Orange are tablets and computers; yellow are phones. The center of the burst is the device and person sending out the information. These are the screen names of the people posting about Zoey. This heavy concentration of activity all centers around a website. This site started three months ago. Look at some of the comments. "Zoey, just slit your wrists already"? "No one would miss you if you were dead." How are kids this cruel? Because they're hiding behind a keyboard. They think their words have no consequences. Press "send" and move on. ♪ ♪ Ramirez :  I found all this and,  worst of all, a video taken of her without her knowledge. From her camera on her laptop. Ryan : Zoey's being watched. Recorded. Terrorized in her own bedroom. The cyberbully was posting Zoey's journal entries, private photos... Used to be bullying was limited to the confines of your school. When you went home, you could have a break, but... ...now thanks to the Internet, a bully can attack anonymously, 24/7. There's no safe haven. If I was Zoey, I'd run away. Disappear. Or commit suicide. ♪ CSI Cyber 1x07 ♪

♪ Oh, yeah. ♪ Why didn't she tell me she was being bullied? I could've helped her. I could've done something. Jordan, only one in ten cyberbullying victims tell their parents. There's such a high level of shame and fear involved. When I was a kid, if you got bullied, there were physical signs. Cuts, bruises-- you couldn't hide it. I should've taken her computer out of her room. Limited her phone access. She would've figured out a way to get online. This is addictive behavior. Teens stay up all night texting, messaging, surfing the web. It's called vamping. Is there anyone you can think of who would want to lash out at Zoey like this? (huffs) Did she have a fight with anyone? A girlfriend? An ex? No! I feel like I don't know anything about my own daughter! Jordan, this is not your fault. Look, the only person she had a problem with was me. What do you mean? Why? I started seeing someone this year. And Zoey wasn't comfortable with me dating her. So I ended the relationship. Zoey's my world. What if she doesn't know that? What if I never get to tell her? Forensic analysis of Zoey's computer hard drive revealed deleted messages from her FriendAgenda page, which I recovered. I found a long thread of messages. She was having an online relationship with an Owen Campbell. Mm-hmm. Started about five months ago. She must've deleted the messages so her father wouldn't find them. The last message Owen sent her was the day before she went missing. "Leave everything behind. You can start over. Come be with me." Get me an address. Okay. (grunts) Where's Zoey Tan? I already told the cops I don't know where she is! You told her to come here-- why? Yeah, I didn't tell her anything! I moved to North Carolina three years ago, and I haven't even... I barely knew her at D.C.! But you communicated with her online. No. No! Owen! Let's talk about your FriendAgenda page. You sent this message to Zoey, asking her to come to North Carolina to be with you. You want to start telling the truth? Whoa, I... I didn't send that message. This isn't even my FriendAgenda page! Can I show you? Thanks. See? This is my real page. Zoey was catfished. Somebody was pretending to be you on FriendAgenda. Well, how did they get my photos? Anybody can go on your page  and steal your photos to create a fake account. Zoey thought she was having an online relationship with you. Look. There are hundreds of messages here. Oh, yeah, I didn't send any of these things. I told you, you know. I barely knew Zoey. I would never tell her that... I loved her, you know? That's why I was freaking out when she shows up out of nowhere at my house this morning. Wait! You're telling me that Zoey was alive and in North Carolina this morning? What time did you see her? It was around, uh, 8:00 a.m. or something... Owen, we need you to tell us exactly exactly what happened when you saw Zoey today! I answered the door. And then I pushed her away when she tried to hug me. It was just super awkward 'cause my actual girlfriend was there. Mundo : Was she upset? Yeah, she seemed pretty pissed off. I mean... she said that I lied to her. And I was just like the others. Um... then I told her to leave. And... and she did. Do you have any idea where she went? Was she in a car? I don't know. No, I don't think so. She just walked away. I just put a BOLO out on Zoey to local police. Hopefully they'll get eyes on her soon. So... Zoey's relationship with Fake Owen started five months ago. Two months later, the bullying started. It's got to be the same person, right? Our target wanted Zoey to suffer by creating an environment  where she believed there was only person she could turn to and then... Mundo :  That all came crashing down when she  met Owen and realized she'd been catfished. It's a pretty elaborate scheme. Catfishing, spoofing, RATing, cyberbullying-- what's the endgame? We're looking for someone who wants to ruin Zoey's life. By isolating her from friends and family. Pushing her to the edge. Well, before she falls over, we better find her. Oh, you better believed I authorized it. I'll call you later. Have you located our target's computer? Yeah, the node our cyberbully used is somewhere in Zoey's high school. I'm on my way now. All right. So, Avery believes our cyberbully mastermind is part of this whole social media conversation pushing it forward, encouraging people to respond. I can map the degree of centrality. Figure out which kids are central to the network, consistently instigating new conversations. I don't see how anybody survives high school these days. That's why I dropped out. You were bullied? Always been different. My life was a living hell from first grade on. When I was 15, I left school. Became a hacker. Started with the little stuff, but then... Yeah, but then you were arrested for shutting down the entire power grid of New Hampshire. But you can't tell me you put on the black hat and orchestrated the largest SCADA attack we've seen because you were bullied. No, but being bullied forced me to escape, run away, become a loner. Because I didn't trust people, and the computer was a safe place where I had control. I could be anybody I wanted to be online. So... I became a black hat. So, did you ever consider using your hacking skills to get revenge? Oh, yeah. Oh, there's this kid named Trevor. He is lucky my FBI badge prevents me from kicking his ass all over the Internet. His butt. I mean kick his butt. Wh... Hey. What's going on here? Push in. This is happening right now. They all seem to be posting about the same event. "We don't need to #SaveZoey, we need to #RunFromZoey"? When was this video posted? A few minutes ago. By Zoe It's Zoey! Loop Avery and Elijah in on this! I've been bullied, tormented, tortured by you. Faceless screen names. Spreading my humiliation across the Web. I was told by strangers to kill myself. They said the world would be a better place without me. And I believed them. I need to do something to make this miserable existence worthwhile. I know who started the "Kill Yourself Zoey Tan" Web site. You have 24 hours to confess... or you'll be sorry. That was a threat. She's a a vigilante hunting her cyberbully. Actually, I got to call you back. I found a pattern on the cluster graph. As soon as a new post appeared on the cyberbullying page, there were 12 teens who consistently sent out the link or commented on ToggleFly, which is like Twitter. I'm calling them "The First Responders." 12, okay. Zoey could certainly believe one of these is her bully. We need to I.D. the person responsible before Zoey makes good on her threat and retaliates. Let me just see that. Right now, all I have are the First Respondes screen names. All right, we can request a subpoena to get their legal names from ToggleFly. But... What's wrong? You're certain about these handles? Yeah. This is serious, Aaron. Your ToggleFly handle is on a short list of potential targets. You're one of 12 instigators. And I want to know why you were cyberbullying Zoey. Everybody else was doing it. Well, you're not everyone! I raised you better than this. Dad, it's not that big a deal. It's just a joke. Well.... do you see me laughing? Your words hurt this girl. Words have consequences. And cyberbullying happens to be a crime. If that girl commits suicide, you could be held responsible. But, Dad, this girl is crazy! Like, for real crazy. And-and here, I-I got proof. She knows how to use a gun! Where did you get this? Um... I don't want to get anyone in trouble. You're worried about getting somebody else in trouble? Zoey is missing. Now, she could be suicidal, she could be homicidal. Tell me where you got this video. (sighs) Sam posted it. He took it when his family went hunting with Zoey and her dad last year. 
 
 Kids are scared today, Dad. They think she's gonna go all Columbine on us. Don't suggest things like that. This conversation isn't over, yet. Man, you missed some major developments. Headline is-- Zoey's pissed and is on a rampage. Now, I'm trying to find her before she does some serious damage to her cyberbully. Whatever you got can't top that. Au contraire, my vertically challenged friend. I found the device that the cyberbully was using to torment Zoey. I went to Zoey's high school library. I had to hook up directly to the router to find the exact computer that the cyberbully used. Then I searched every device on the network. And I found my culprit. You know, it's a shame we can't prosecute computers, because this would be case closed. Okay, so you're saying we have the gun, but we don't have the person that pulled the trigger? Correct. The computer that was spoofing Zoey's devices was in the high school library, so anybody with access to that room could be the cyberbully. 950 kids go to that school... Oh, we could be dealing with more than one target. Bullies like to team up. It's mob mentality. Would you let me finish? The good news is the cyberbully doesn't know the jig is up. I swapped this hard drive tower with a decoy  and installed a wiretap on the system. If that cyberbully uses that computer to update the cyberbullying site, (scoffs) oh, we'll know. That's what I'm talking about. And that's what I'm talking about. Ooh. Damn. Ow. (computer beeps) Wait, I just got something. It's a signal from the tablet that Zoey used. Nelson just located the device Zoey used to make her vigilante video. He's sending us the coordinates now. (cell phone chimes) It's near the intersection of Bedford and 12th. Then she's less than half a mile away. She's on the move. Turn left here. The next street, turn right. She's about a block ahead. That must be her in that blue Crosstrek. Two cars in front of us. This is Special Agent Avery Ryan. We are in pursuit-- we need backup from police and FBI units in Charlotte. Our suspect is heading north on Ontario Drive in a blue Crosstrek. Pull over, but do not approach. (car honks) Driver might be armed and dangerous. Ryan :  She just ran the stop sign. (car honks) (cell phone rings) Simon, go. Avery, I just got a hit on Jordan Tan's credit card. Zoey bought ammunition at a store in North Carolina a half hour ago. She blew through that stop sign, and she's got ammo. She means business. Ryan : Zoey! Let me see both your hands. Where's Zoey? Where is she? Mundo : Keep your hands where I can see them. I-I don't know a Zoey Tan. Isabella, is this your iPad? Yes. This is Zoey. Have you seen her? (gasps gently) Actually, yes. She-she found my iPad earlier today. I was getting coffee and lost it. She returned it to me. Why? Something happen to her? We've got every department between North Carolina and DC on alert. We're focusing on public transit. But how did Zoey get that woman's iPad in the first place? Ryan :  Zoey was desperate. She needed to get online. She saw an opportunity, and she took it. When she was finished making the video, she dropped it back off at the coffee cart. Excuse me, I found this on the ground. I think someone might have dropped it. You found it?! Thank you. Thank you. Oh. Yeah, but, I mean, why not just dump it? Why bring it back and return to the scene of the crime? She felt guilty. It was worth the risk of getting caught to clear her conscience. She's a good kid. Yeah. I don't know, I just wish Aaron had the same conscience. You know, he had almost no remorse for what he did to Zoey. If I have to hear "everyone else is doing it" just one more time... Aaron wanted to be a part of the social norm. He felt powerful, in control. He got caught up in a cyber-mob. Which led to a diffusion of responsibility. No, he didn't just join in. Avery, he helped lead the charge. He'll be less likely to engage in bullying behavior because you know. So open up the conversation with him. Tell Aaron that you expect and you trust him to make better decisions. And if he doesn't, monitor him. Yeah. All right, all right. Session's over. So let's get back into Zoey's head. I analyzed her patterns of life looking for a tipping point. Looking for some event that would reveal her cyberbully. But I couldn't find any fights with any friends, no bad breakups. Before the cyberbullying, Zoey led a very ordinary life for a 17 year old. The only thing I'm sure of is that she's unsure. About what she'll do next? About who her cyberbully is. If she knew, why wouldn't she say it in her video threat? I know who started the "Kill yourself, Zoey Tan" Web site. You have 24 hours to confess, or you'll be sorry. Yeah, she's on the same search we are. Only, Zoey's experiencing overwhelming humiliation and anger. Which could push her to follow through on her threats of revenge. Well, we need to find her before that happens. I'll send units over to Flintwood High. There is not gonna be a school shooting on my watch. (tablet chimes) Zoey posted again. Another video. "You should think twice about cyberbullying. Especially if your dad works for the FBI." Sifter : This was done in my son's bedroom. From his computer. Zoey has RATed my son's computer. RATing software's easy to download. She's following through on her threats. Doing psychological damage to Aaron. Right. She just got revenge with a cyber-bomb. Yeah, what if psychological revenge isn't enough? She decides to get physical damage in the real world? She's starting with Aaron, someone else will be next-- until she finds out who her bully is. I'm gonna have Nelson pick up his computer. Zoey must have stolen another device to RAT Aaron. We're gonna find her. All right. ♪ ♪ We need to figure out who the cyberbully mastermind is before Zoey does. I got all the legal names of the first responders. Three of them don't go to Zoey's high school. Leaving us with nine possible targets. I narrowed them down, looking at the time stamps of the cyberbullying page, There was a consistent pattern. They all seem to appear between 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. Hmm. Is there any way to determine which students were in the library at that time? We sure can-- I have all the school schedules. Eight out of the nine students didn't have access to the library between 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. since it was occupied by the yearbook staff. Leaving us with Jennifer Mayfield. I honestly don't know who started the page. I feel so awful for Zoey. We've been friends since preschool. I don't think I've ever called one of my friends a "heinous bitch" or told them I wish that they would die a slow and painful death. Well, some friends deserve it. Zoey betrayed you, didn't she? One of the first posts on that page was a chat between Zoey and another girl. About me. Zoey revealed some stuff I told her. Private stuff. So, yeah, I was pissed. After the page started. Before that, we were cool. (cell phone plays music) Oh, my God. I can't believe she did this. Zoey posted a photo of me undressing in my room on ToggleFly. That photo was taken on the camera of your computer. It doesn't feel great to be on the other side of cyberbullying, does it? I didn't start the page, I just joined in. Jennifer, this is important. Do you have any idea where Zoey is? No. (knocking on glass) You can go. Think I have a lead on where Zoey might be. I went old-school-- traced her movements on the iPad, based on the ridge detail left on the screen. A fingerprint smudge path... that she left behind when she uploaded the video. Mundo :  Then I found a rogue print, which I just got confirmation...  is Zoey's. Zoey searched for directions to the city of Chesapeake Bay. Mm-hmm. Only problem is, there's no address. I don't need an address. I know exactly where she's going. Jordan :  When she first disappeared, I called the cops in Chesapeake Bay. They searched the cabin. She wasn't there. We haven't been to the cabin since Annette passed away. We're gonna find Zoey. Just like we expected, there's a Backdoor Trojan on Jennifer's computer. And on Sifter's son's. Found the same foreign IP address on both devices. That links to the computer from the library, that we confiscated. I just traced the origin of Zoey's posts on ToggleFly. They also came from the computer in the library. I've got a wiretap on that computer. I would've seen the transmissions. Other than kids checking their e-mail and trying to look up blocked p0rn sites, there hasn't been a lot of activity there. Zoey's not the one sending out these posts. The cyberbully RATed those kids' computers and hijacked Zoey's ToggleFly account. So our target is doing all of this without physical access to that computer in the library. And they have to be connected to the high school's network in order to spoof the computer. So the device used to spoof that computer is at the high school? That means our cyberbully is there, too. Come on. Ramirez : All right, let's search the network for the device. Nelson : If the cyberbully's computer's on line, we'll get its unique I.D. Ramirez : Yeah, the MAC address. I used to hide out in my school's library during lunch. Mm-hmm. The librarian was practically my best friend. So where do you hide out now? (quiet laugh) The cyberbully lured Zoey to Owen. Dropped her phone in the park. Spoofed her phone. All so they could send you that suicide text. And the phone call. Zoey! Zoey... We've been thinking about this all wrong. It isn't about Zoey. It's about you. You were the intended victim. Me? I don't understand. You're saying that someone's bullying Zoey because of me? That doesn't make sense. What are you doing? I need to look at your phone. We found the MAC address. That's it. That's the IP address of the computer linked to this computer, that spoofed Zoey's devices, and it's definitely here in this school. This will tell us when we're getting closer to the target's device. It's 76% now. Okay, 88%. We just hit 97%. Any of them could be connected to the network through the Wi-Fi. (phone ringing) Avery? Did you find Zoey? Elijah, we had it all wrong. You're not looking for a student. I should've known. It's always the jilted lover. We're on it. Hundred percent. And now we have our proof. All right, time for me to get a little guidance. (school bell ringing) Arianna Peterson? Yes. Agent Mundo. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Zoey Tan. Of course. Yes. Um, anything I can do to help. Come on in. I'm sorry about this mess. I'm also yearbook advisor. I'm doing double duty around here. So... should we be worried about our safety, since Zoey is still out there? Usually victims of cyberbullying kill themselves, not other people. Oh, God. Zoey was being cyberbullied? You're her guidance counselor. You didn't know that? Well, I heard rumors. But I stay off of social media. Really? 'Cause you updated Zoey's cyberbullying page, 20 minutes ago, from your computer. Like a criminal who gloves up and files a serial number off a gun, you took every cyber precaution to hide yourself. But, like most criminals, you made a mistake-- using a burn phone to text Zoey's father. We traced the serial number from that phone right back to you. You can't prove any of what you're saying. Even I know that burner phones are untraceable. But what you don't know is that the first time you connect a phone with a computer, it logs that activity. Mundo :  Leaves a digital trace. A cyber fingerprint. You plugged your burner phone into this computer minutes before texting Zoey's father. We know he ended his relationship with you. What are you talking about? Must've really pissed you off. 'Cause you decided to torture Jordan. You called him Zoey? Zoey... when he was in Rock Creek Park,  just to, what... hear the fear in his voice? You have no idea what he did to me. He dumped me... like a piece of trash. All because of  her. He chose  her. She's his daughter-- what did you expect? A few weeks after you and Jordan broke up,  you started catfishing Zoey,  drawing her into a fake online  relationship with Owen. Because, if she was happy with Owen, I thought she'd let her dad be happy, too, and she'd be okay with us getting back together. Mundo :  But when none of that worked,  then you RATed Zoey's computer  and started a cyberbullying page, to torment Zoey. I wanted Jordan to suffer, just like I did. But why go after Zoey? Why do that to a 17-year-old girl? Because the best way to hurt a father is to hurt his child. Arianna Peterson, you're under arrest for cyber fraud and aggravated stalking. (mobile device cameras clicking) Worst guidance counselor ever. (gunshot) Was that a gunshot? I keep that car covered and the key hidden! Zoey must be here! Zoey! Zoey! Zoey! Oh, my God! Oh...
