 Hey, come on.

 Come on. Come on.

 No. 
 JWF-553. 
 No. 
 WOB-01248. 
 No. 
 That one's German. 
 Yeah, and not on our list. 
 Hi. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 There you go, was there anything? 
 Not much. Had a 112 call about something in the sky above Marebo Lake. 
 Something burning. 
 It'll be a Halloween thing. There is usually something. 
 And there's a possible missing grandma. 
 She didn't turn up to babysit this morning. 
 And how late is she? 
 About four hours. 
 We'll keep in regular contact with the family. 
 If she doesn't come back, then we'll go first thing in the morning. 
 OK. 
 All right, thanks. 
 MLB-975. 
 No. 
 Just hold on here. 
 Good. Very good. 
 Just hold on, hold on here. 
 Great, can you move your leg for me? 
 You decided anything about what you're going to do? 
 Work-wise? 
 Well, I don't mean, just... 
 It's not going to be what I used to do, is it? 
 It's OK, really. 
 Because I could have died. 
 Kurt, you don't need to keep on coming. 
 I've got Henrik, and Sanna. 
 Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 It's time for everybody to get on with life. 
 OK? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 New beginnings. 
 Do you need any help getting... 
 No. 
 OK, I'll just... 
 Yeah. 
 I'll see you. 
 Thanks, Kurt. 
 Yeah. 
 Say hello to Henrik and everybody... OK? 
 (Dog pants and whines) 
 Yes, yes, yes. I'm coming, coming, coming. 
 Good boy, good boy, you are. Good boy. Mr Smelly, smelly. 
 Oh, yes, yes. Let me put the lights on, put the lights on. 
 Yeah. How are you? How are you? How are you? 
 Have you behaved yourself? 
 No, you haven't behaved yourself. Look at all this. 
 Did you knock this water bottle again? What's all that about, eh? 
 What's all that about? You are a big mess maker, you are. 
 You're a big mess maker. 
 Come here. 
 Anna. 
 Anna, is that you? 
 You OK? 
 Come in. 
 Come in. 
 Are you sure you're all right? I hope the dog didn't scare you. 
 Can I get you some water or something? 
 Are you looking for Linda? Cos she's got married actually. 
 I know. I just wanted to see you. 
 Yeah? 
 You came round to our house after Dad died. 
 You were Linda's dad. 
 I couldn't understand what you were doing there. 
 You were my friend's dad. I always trusted you. 
 What's up? 
 I always loved him. 
 Yeah, I know you did. 
 Why...? 
 Why would he want to kill himself? 
 Why would he want to kill himself when he had me? 
 Maybe we should call your mum, eh? 
 Is she... She's still out at Valleberga, isn't she? 
 I know I have the number somewhere here. 
 I know how tough it can be, Anna. 
 I know... these things, some times you just have to... some times you just have to let... 
 Anna? 
 (Door swings and bangs) 
 Anna? 
 Anna! 
 (Phone rings) 
 (Phone rings) 
 Hello? Linda, hi, it's Dad. It's your dad. I know. It's late. What's up? Anna Westin was here. She's a cultural geographer. She makes maps of old pathways. So the last time you saw her was Sunday morning? Yeah. She seemed OK? Is your mum married? Divorced. Actually, she's widowed. My stepfather died last Christmas. Martin. Was she coping OK with that? Mum wouldn't... The boys mean too much to her. Sure, of course. I'll get the keys. Yes, thank you. Let's start the hospital search. Thank you. We'll be in touch. That's not yours. Leave it. Police. Do you know whose it is? Yeah, she makes maps. Her name's Birta. You seen her around today? No, what's up? Sorry. Let's just get that planted, Niklas. You couldn't tell me where this trail is, could you? Yeah, that's the old pilgrim trail. Runs about six or seven kilometres by the lake. Right. Over there. OK. Thanks. What's the matter? Is she OK? Yeah, I hope so. (Sudden noise of birds) (Police radio chatter) So we need statements from those community service workers. What about those 112 calls? Things burning? They can't access the recordings. The system's crashed. All we know is the call was logged 17:52, Monday night. But have we got an ID on the phone number? No, they need to reboot the system. OK as soon as you can. Over here, sir! All right, thanks. It was in the grave. But it's not been burnt. It's been annotated in Danish. Mostly the Book of Revelations. At the back. I used to be a Christian but then I became a forensic pathologist. Danish. She burned to death. That's what killed her. And then she was buried? He watched her burn to death, and then buried her. (Sobbing) (She cries) Did we talk to the community service lot? Yeah, they're all mainly fraud and drink driving. All alibied. What do you think? I think she might have just met a madman in the woods. OK, we'll catch up in the morning then. Sure. Kurt, I've managed to identify the prints on the Bible. Really? Jannek Langas. Danish. Been missing from a secure unit in Odense since November 2009. Odense? He's an arsonist. It's a psychiatric unit. And a paranoid schizophrenic. OK, let's get uniform to go to the hostels, campsites, holiday lets. Lennart'll... Lennart will organise the press conference. Would you get the descriptions and the photos set up for that, please? Right. Kristina, thanks. Well done. Sure. Hi... Hi. Hi. This is... What are you doing down here? You scared me last night, Dad. Sorry, I didn't mean to... What was the matter with Anna? It's just the same, her Dad. I've not been able to get hold of her. Look, I'm sure she'll be fine. Why did you call me if she was fine? I thought you... You know how she used to be. I'm going to stay at her place tonight. I've still got keys. See if she turns up. OK. Can I give you a lift? This is Anna Westin, please leave your message. Hi, Anna, it's Linda again. I've got to Ystad now, so I'm just going to let myself in, OK? Give me a call. Maybe you should try calling her mum? They don't speak. Look, come and stay at mine, please. It's silly. I'll call you tomorrow. Linda. I'll come out and see you when she gets back, OK? Jannek Langas. He has distinctive scarring on the right side of his face. We have reason to believe he was in the Marebo Lake area on Monday evening. We believe he has the potential to be very dangerous. I'd ask anybody who might have vacant properties around that area, summer houses, garages, just to check if there might have been anyone sleeping rough there. But, obviously, if you do see him, don't make contact. Don't approach him. Please contact Ystad Police immediately. Now, I'm happy to take any questions but please remember that there may be some details I'll be unable to discuss. (Phone vibrates) Does he already have a criminal record? Wallander. This is Louise Akerblom, the estate agent. I hope you don't mind me calling you but I know that man. No, that's all right. Let me come and see you right now, if I may. Thank you. Previous convictions? I'm afraid I'm not able to discuss that at this time. That is all we have time for. Thank you all for coming. Got to go and talk to someone. We'll keep you informed if there are any further developments. I recognised him as soon as I saw him on the news. That scar. It wasn't that name but it was definitely him. Right, so what name did he use? Jan Sundberg. He was in here in February. What, he was buying a house? Yeah, in the woods at Marebo Lake. Have you still got the brochures for that? Yeah. You're liking your new place? It was always one of my favourites, that one. Amazing views over the Ostersjon. It's very nice, yeah. How did he pay for this? Cash. 580,000. We went to SFB in the square and he transferred the money. So what impression did you have of him? Did he seem...? He was fine. We talked about God, when we weren't talking about houses. He asked me if I'd been saved. I told him I had. Kurt? Jannek Langas bought a house on Marebo Lake in February so I'm going to head out there now. Don't go out there on your own. I'll call Lindeman, see who's available for support. I don't think that's necessary. Just let me have a look first, yeah? Stefan, it's Lennart. I think he's long gone. Yeah. OK, stay here. Kurt, let these guys do it. It's OK, I've got it covered. Wait. Just stay back. (Chickens cluck, flap wings) Cover! (Gunshot) Stop, stop! Stop it, stop! Stop firing! Whoa, stop! Hold fire! Move, move! (Kurt groans) OK, watch it. That's it. Now click that thing. You've got it. Upstairs! You all right? Yeah, it's not, um... All clear! Thank you. Take these. Thanks. Ta. He's got a bank account, SFB, in the name of Jan Sundberg. That's the clearing number and the account number. OK. How are we doing on that 112 call? Kurt, I'm on it... "As I said to their children in the wilderness, do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their rules, nor defile yourself with their idols." Do you recognise this? Do you know where this church is? No. (Phone chimes) Yeah, Linda. Anna's not been back. All her stuff's here but I don't think she's been here. I think she's gone, Dad, properly. Right. Why don't I go and, um...? I'll come over later, all right? We'll find out where she is. OK. All right, yeah? Yeah. (Numerous people sobbing and wailing) (Crying stops with a mechanical click) Kurt. You OK, Monika? It's a symphony of crying people. 44 different crying, uh, voices isn't the word. I leave them a little recorder. They switch it on when they're upset. Really? They're easier to get hold of than you think. Anna came to see me the other night. Oh? How was she? She was upset. Right. I haven't seen her around, I think last... round Christmas. She doesn't really speak to me any more. It's just she's, uh, I mean, Linda's at her place. But I don't think she's been there for a while. She's not picking up her phone. She was studying in Lund. Right. She had some digs there, I think. Ah, yeah. She might be there. You still in Mariagatan? No, actually, I bought a place in Svarte, near where my Dad used to live. Ah. How was it, in the end? Not so great. But, um... Do you get nervous, out here on your own? I always carry a hunting knife. Don't tell me that. You're OK! You've got a gun. Look, if Anna's gone off somewhere, she's done it before. You know she's done it before. She used to go off looking for Erik before he died. And, well, I don't know what she looks for now. Ghosts, I suppose. I'm sure she'll be fine, Kurt. Well, I'll, um... Thanks for that, I'll get back. I'll tell Linda and I'm sure the, uh... Do you ever get the feeling you've failed your child? Just... will you let me know if you hear from her? Linda got married, didn't she? Yeah. You didn't. No, I didn't. Nice to see you. Bye. Bye-bye. Wallander. Kurt, Langas had 620,000 in his account. Opened on May 9th last year with a cash deposit of 70k here in Ystad. Six more big cash deposits, the withdrawal for the house. Then he took out the rest and the account was closed. And when were the other deposits made? June 7th, and then about every six weeks until January 26th this year. He was travelling around, covering his tracks. But where's he getting all this cash from? Get hold of all the bank's paperwork, please,  and look into cash robberies at around the time of the deposits. Sure. Thanks, Stefan. (Entry buzzer rings) Hi. Hi. I've just been to see Monika. She thinks that Anna's OK. You know, she does this, so she will turn up. I'm not sure Monika would necessarily know. How is she, Monika? She seems OK. Mum always thought you and her had an affair. Well, I mean, we can talk about who had an affair and who didn't, Linda, I mean... I don't know if you want to but we can. But Monika was saying that Anna's studying at Lund University. Really? So she might have digs there. Has she taken things from here? No. Contacts, toothbrush. It's all there. Mobile phone charger. I remember she couldn't stop crying at the funeral. She just screamed and screamed. I think Monika's right. Anna's gonna be fine. It hasn't even been, uh... Hasn't even been 48 hours. Dad? Just, um... What? I just have to, er... What is it? The, um... Is Anna pregnant? She's not pregnant, is she? Not as far as I know. So what's she got a book on pregnancy for if she's not pregnant? I'm pregnant. Anna? Langas? Linda! Are you OK? Yeah. Go! Stay here, right? I'll get Lindeman to pick you up. You're OK? Yeah. (Dogs bark) You're OK. I'm going to call an ambulance. All right, just lie still. She OK? Yeah, I think so. (Car engine starting) (Tyres screech) Stop! Yeah, I need Lindeman to pick up my daughter. She's at Valborgatan 4, flat 6. Langas was there. I'm following him now. He is in a dark blue Volvo. It is O-U... O-U-T-0-4-0. (Tyres screech, car horn blares) (Tyres screech) Emergency. Which service please? There's something burning above Marebo Lake. There's something's burning. Sorry, do you need the fire service? Please, there's something burning. Which service, please? Yeah, it's Anna Westin. She's a schoolfriend of my daughter's actually. She came out to see me on Tuesday night. Why? I don't know exactly. I thought she... She used to come to me and Linda when she was upset. I thought it was something old. Langas was driving Anna's car. He had keys to her flat. I guess she didn't give them to him willingly. Has anyone seen her since Tuesday night? I don't know. It looks like she hasn't gone back to her flat. Her mother hasn't seen her. Excuse me. (Dog pants) Come on, that's it. Good boy. Yeah? This is Jussi, by the way. Oh! Jussi, hello! Oh, he's lovely. He's smelly is what he is. Come on, you. Come on this way. It's a beautiful house. Thank you. You know, I'm sure that... I'm sure Anna will be OK. Um, we'll find her. We're going to Lund in the morning. She's probably there. I'll come with you. I'd like to help. Well, maybe leave it for now. I mean, you're probably a bit... You look a bit tired. Yeah. We'll get you settled in here and get a good night's sleep, eh? What do you think, Dad? About, uh? The baby. I'm delighted. I'm totally delighted. Come on, let's... You're over here. (Muffled house music) Hi. Yeah? Oh, hello. Police. I'm looking for a student called Anna Westin. I think this used to be her room. Her? She dropped out ages ago. You know why she dropped out? No idea. No difficulties with studies or personal problems that she might have mentioned to you? Oh, well, I tried to have as little to do with her as possible. You couldn't trust her. Why, what's she done? Did you ever see her here with a man, an older man? Anna? No. She's saving herself for Jesus. You could be a bit less sarcastic about it. She's a God-freak. I hate God-freaks. I tried to discuss abortion with her once and she went ballistic. Did she leave anything behind? Yeah, actually, there's a box of her crap under the bed. Do you mind if I have a look at it, please? Thank you. OK, I'll take this if I may. Thanks for your help. Can I help you? Ah, yes. Kurt Wallander. Ystad Police. I'm looking for a woman called Anna Westin. What for? So you know her? She used to help with the outreach group. I run a mission for homeless people. Drugs, alcohol, psychiatric problems. Was she a member of your church as well? Sometimes. She mostly just sat at the back. Well, we think she might be missing. It's been a couple of days now. I've not seen her for ages. Months. Right. Do you know, um, do you know this man? Did he come to that group? His name is Jannek Langas. Yeah, maybe. So she could have met him? She might have met him at this group? Do you think she did? I don't know. Maybe. I'm not really minded to help the police. Your colleagues in Stockholm sent me to prison. I stood in my pulpit in my church and I preached against homosexuality. I was prosecuted and sent to prison for one month for hate crimes. And my conviction was overturned. There are no hate crimes when Christians are on the receiving end, are there? Do you, you get a big audience for this? People don't really go to the Church of Sweden any more. They find it immoral. Do they? Please let us know if you see her. Thank you. 
 
 Hi. Anna hasn't been studying at Lund University since the beginning of the year. She dropped out. Really? Yes, she's been a volunteer with an outreach group. This was a group that was attached to an Evangelical church. She's doing just what her father did. So when you last saw her, did she mention any of this? No. So what did you talk about? She wanted to know why I hadn't done certain things differently. Like what? She wanted to know whether Erik had ever been in touch before he killed himself. When he was in the States. Had he? Monika? Yes. Not long before he... Not long before he died, he asked me to bring her, for all of us to go with him. I told him never to contact us again. And you didn't tell Anna? She used to run away. You know that! Any chance at all, she would run away, looking for him. You don't think you should have told her? Anna was attacked. When she went off on one of her trips looking for him, she was attacked by some man. I just wanted her to be safe. Right. You can't compete with a dead person. She would have preferred if it was me. I'm sure that's not true, Monika. Hi, Linda, it's me. I'm in here. Stay there. Was Anna at the University? No. She'd dropped out. Sorry. She hasn't been seen lately. And? And what? She might've met that man at a church group. She might have been trying to help him. In what way? What do you mean? Well, it was kind of an outreach group, so... She, maybe she'd been helping him for some time. I don't know. Do you think he killed her too? Hey. Hey there, Rabbit. Was Anna religious when you were kids? Yeah. Even after her dad? It made her worse. Thanks. Her mum wouldn't let her go to church so she used to sneak off. You brought Erik back, didn't you, you and Svedberg? No, we just, we received the coffin at the airport, and we did help with the paperwork. Just anything to make it easier for Monika and Anna, that was all. You want some wine? No. Sorry. That's OK. We've got some strange-looking tea that Vanja left. I'll have some strange-looking tea. I liked Vanja. Me too. So what does Hans Von Enke think? He's excited. He's very sweet. I'd love to meet him one day. Don't have to wear a tie, will I? He's not that posh. I would have loved to have been there when you got married, Linda. I would have really liked that. You haven't been here at all since grandad died. And you haven't been to Stockholm. You haven't called. Yes, because you met someone, got married, and didn't ask me to go! You know what I was doing that weekend? I went to a bloody autopsy and then I cleaned the gutters at Mariagatan and then your mum rang me.  She  tells me my daughter's just got married. Why'd she get to go? She was just there. It just happened. Let me tell you something else that happens. You'll get a few years of learning to walk and birthdays and Father Christmas, and then you'll get years of teenage sh1t and you know what I was looking forward to, like as the last proud thing? Walking my daughter down the aisle. I would really have liked that. We didn't want anyone else there. His parents weren't there. Oh! We were just on holiday, with Mum, just did it. I'm sorry. And then you were so horrible about it. Let's not do this, Dad. Not any more, OK? We're here because of Anna. (Mobile phone rings) Yeah? Is it Langas? We'll know in a couple of hours. It's the same accelerant that killed Medberg. Same petrol can. Right, I'll see you back at the station. I need to speak to the headmistress, please. He killed all the animals? Yes. They used to feed them, draw them. Do you think there's a reason why someone would want to destroy your biology labs? What? Other than being mentally ill? This is a faith school. A Christian school? Not any more. I came here, I didn't want that. The problem recently is that we implemented the ban on teaching creationism. There has been some criticism. Creationism would be part of biology? Not in my book. Excuse me, sorry. Yeah. Anything else, or can I...? Er, no. No, that's all. Thanks very much. Thank you. We'll be in touch. "Two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulphur. The rest of them where killed by the sword that came out of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on the flesh." I confess to murder. I'm sacrificing myself for the sins of others. I'm doing this in the name of him who was dead and who rose again. Play it again. We have to focus on where he'd been before this. Maybe that'll lead us to whatever happened to Anna Westin. Take it back just before the end. Yeah, there. I'm doing this in the name of him who was dead and who rose again. See, he doesn't switch that off. He doesn't lean forward. He doesn't switch it off-- Someone else does. He wasn't alone. Somebody else was filming him, they took the tape out of the camera. They leave it for me at the school. Excuse me. Sorry, I'm just... I know we spoke the other day. Could you help me with one more thing? Yes, of course. There's a red house on the lake with a few outbuildings around it. At the end of the pilgrim trail? Did you see anybody there recently? Yes, a few people. Fixing it up. How many of them were there would you say? I don't know. Six or seven? And what did you make of them? I don't know, they seemed normal enough. An alternative health group. Like a commune or something. Kurt. Get Langas's bank account details in front of you, please. OK. Right, 26th January. 80,000 krona. That's the final deposit. Yeah, that money came from Anna Westin. How many other deposits? Six. Check banks in the same towns, for cash withdrawals. Not deposits-- withdrawals. Same amounts, from other bank accounts. The money wasn't stolen, he was given it. Julia Hassleberg. She's from Lulea. She went missing in June last year. She emptied her accounts and left. 100,000 krona. The same day, 100,000 shows up in the Langas account, deposited in the same town. Yeah well she's not up north now. She was at the press conference. Jon Soderberg. He was at the school this morning. Hasn't been seen since August last year. Cleared his savings on the 23rd. Same day, the same amount enters the Langas account. Henrik Jacobssen. Erika Bredfeldt. Klas Hallgren. All emptied their accounts, left home, sent their cash to Langas. And they'd all been involved with fundamentalist churches. Cultural Christians. Anti-gay, pro-life, anti-Islam. They're members of a cult. Now there are seven deposits. These names account for five, plus Anna's. So who made the last one? This guy you met at Anna's church. Where is he? Svensson. He's a Cultural Christian, right? He's been in prison. These people could be in danger, if they are part of a gang. Anna, I know you're alive. I know you're with other people, and I know who they are. I am going to find you, please contact me first. If you can. We were talking about social tourists as a direct reflection of EU policy. Immigration from Islamic countries is essentially undermining... Excuse me. What is it? We know Anna Westin met Jannek Langas at this church. He burnt himself to death last night. Were you involved with a group that supported him? Did you give him money? I run an Outreach Group. I help people like Jannek, I don't finance them. Right, when did you last see Anna Westin? When?! She came back here... a couple of months ago. I hadn't seen her for a while. Why did she come back? She wanted me to join a group. They had a retreat somewhere in the forest. Join them and do what? Make a stand. What does that mean? Make some sort of stand? I don't know. She just left. What if she was being coerced? Ultimately it's her choice. Look, nobody joins a cult. Nobody joins something they think is going to hurt them, or anyone else. You join something with people that you really like. People you believe in. (Phone rings) Don't you? Anna? Kurt, will you come and see me... Please? Where are you? Anna? Are you OK? Yes. Where are the others? It's just me now. I met Jannek at the outreach group, he'd just come down here. He was a schizophrenic and he was afraid he was getting ill again. I tried to help him, I tried to get him off his medication. I tried to look after him. Anna, you don't have to do this. You don't have to do what these people tell you to do. I'm not. It's just me. Can we have a couple of coffees, please? We're all sinners. We all need to make atonement for our own sins and for the sins of other people. There is so much that's wrong and we've moved away from the spiritual side of things entirely in this country. You can't force religion on people, Anna. Why not? It's not part of society. It's not part of  our  society. It happens all over the rest of the world. Anyway, the government forces social democracy and liberalism on us all. Did you help Jannek Langas kill himself? I just need to be left. I just need to get on with things in my own way. I'm afraid that's not going to happen. Why did you come out to see me, Anna? I was erm... about what Jannek did. Yeah, and you were upset, and you wanted to talk to me. Talk to us now. Talk to us, Anna. Stay here. Kurt. She's failed to report a crime, she's harboured a criminal. She possibly assisted him. We can charge her. She's a victim in all of this. I don't think we're going to get anywhere keeping her in. Why don't we let her go? Why don't we watch her? Why don't we watch the house? I'm sure that she'll lead us to the others. OK. OK. OK then, we can make a judgment. I appreciate it. Thank you. OK, Anna, you're free to go. You spoke about your dad when you came out to me the other night. I don't need to know about my dad. I think your father was a very misguided man. Stop it. You're not honouring him by living like this. What do you believe in? Do you actually believe in anything? Linda's pregnant. "Your Grandchildren are the crown of the aged, and the glory of children is their fathers." You can come away. Come back. See you. Anna! You know, you end up talking to yourself on these walks. Do you? Well, I do. Actually I have different trees for different people. Front one's my mum. That's Svedberg. The one at the back's your granddad. (She chuckles) I remember the first time I came home in uniform. I thought he was going to have a heart attack. He hated you being a policeman. Well, I don't think he did. I think it just suited him to keep me on my toes. I understood Granddad. Yeah, well I understood him a bit, I think. He was just... You know, he was different with me. He didn't talk to me about souls. He just whinged about being a policeman and never coming over to play cards with him. Do you want me to go and talk to Anna? This is an investigation, Linda, you can't be... I've known her all my life. I can help, I can talk to her. It's not safe. Dad, if she's in danger, maybe she'd talk to me. At least, she'd listen. (Phone rings) Dad. Yep, Wallander. Kurt, there's a church on fire at Grimsberg. What, there's a church burning? In Grimsberg and we're getting reports of more fires. Well can you sort out how many others there are? I'll get back to you. Right move it! Move it! Can you get in the back? We need paramedics in there! Please! Stefan? There's a dead woman inside. She's been hanged. Late 60s? It's Julia Hassleberg. There's another church on fire at Lennarp. There's no sign of Anna Westin so far. There's also a medical centre, dead bodies in both places. What's going on, Dad? I'm going to get someone to take you home. Is it Anna? No, darling, it's not. You need to go home. I'll stay in touch. Michael, take my daughter home, please. All right, I'll see you later. See you. Bye. Bye. There were seven people in the group with Langas. Three of them are now dead. We have to assume they're going to continue making these attacks until they're all dead. Soderberg says he's sinned against the word of God. He died in the church at Lennarp, which is multi-faith, pro-integration. Jacobssen sinned against human life. The place he died uses stem cell research. Julia Hassleberg-- Same-sex relationship. Grimsberg church authorises gay weddings. So this leaves Erika Bredfeldt, Klas Hallgren, and Anna. OK, so we go over their medical files, social security reports, everything we have again. Get any kind of idea where they're likely to target next. We know that they're not killing themselves. That they're getting some kind of help. Someone, at least, is making these videos. Why would it be anybody outside the group? I think it's... I think it's the last one. I think it's number seven. Yeah. My name is Julia Hassleberg. I confess to a physical relationship with a person of the same s*x. My name is Henrik Jacobssen. I have sinned against human life. I'm doing this to atone for my sins and for the sins of others. I'm doing this in the name of him who was dead and who rose again. I am doing this to atone for my own sins and the sins of others. I am doing this in the name of him who was dead and who rose again. I am doing this in the name of him who was dead and who rose again. And who rose again. And who rose again. I am doing this in the name of him who was dead and who rose again. Erik's alive, isn't he? Isn't he? I thought it was him at first. They found the body with his things. What did you think you were doing? What do you think... You declared a body dead when you know it's not him? You bury him? It was better for Anna. What, that she thought her father was dead? I had to stop it, Kurt. She'd been so damaged. It had to stop. Well, he's back now. He's back from the dead and she's with him. With a group that are burning themselves to death every night in places that somehow have connections to sins they believe they've committed. So what was Anna's sin? She hasn't committed any sin. What would she think her sin was? You mentioned that a man attacked her on one of these trips, so what happened to her? Was she raped, Monika? Yes. Did she get pregnant? She had an abortion. I made her have an abortion. She was 15, Kurt. Where's the clinic? Rannesholm. Yeah, Rannesholm Clinic. Anna had an abortion there. Erika Bredfeldt too. Same place. Lindeman and Kristina are on their way. Right. Any sign? No, nothing. What's he doing here? He came to the station. I saw the fires on the news. I thought I can help. They might listen to me, at least more than they might listen to a policeman. Right, that's them. Stefan, Kristina, weapons raised. Visible. This is a reaction. If you push people and push people, eventually they push back. Let me try! Svensson? Wait, no! Hands on the window! Now! In you go. Anna? It's Erika Bredfeldt and Klas Hallgren. Anna? Anna! No. (Phone rings) Wallander. Kurt, it's Monika. They're here. Right, don't let them in. (Siren wails) Anna? Monika? There's petrol here, hold back. Nobody moves, nobody fires. Kurt! Kurt, we're in here! Erik, it's Kurt Wallander. Erik, please! I'm unarmed, I'm putting my weapon down. Erik, I understand the point that you're trying to make. A lot of people have heard what you want to say. They appreciate that you chose times and places where people didn't get hurt so let's just make sure nobody does get hurt, yeah? We're washing things clean. I understand. But do you want to hurt your daughter? Do you want to hurt Monika? Anna. Monika lied. I am so sorry. Darling, I'm so sorry. You lied. OK. Erik, you're a man of faith, I know that. That must mean that you're a man of forgiveness, yes? If I stay here, will you please let Monika go? I'm not leaving this room without my daughter. Erik, will you let Anna go? Anna's here because she wishes to be. Of course she's not here because she wishes to be. Monika! She'd follow you to the ends of the earth. Monika! That's all she's ever done, whether you were dead or alive. Monika! I came back to atone for my sins. For what I did in abandoning my wife and my daughter. Then stay here and be a proper father. Erik, you don't want to harm your daughter. Anna and I will always be together. Put the knife on the table, Monika. Anna, listen to me. When you came out to see me the other night, Anna, do you remember that? You weren't certain. You weren't certain. You were upset, you were full of doubt then. You're full of doubt now. I'm sorry that I couldn't help you the other night. I'm sorry, but I can help you now. No dad wishes harm for his daughter. No father wants this. God gave his own child for the sake of the world. You're not God, Erik. Monika killed your child. My grandchild. I did it for her! I've only ever wanted to make her safe. Anna... I can atone for you. Please, just walk out, please. Please! Just walk away, please just go with Kurt! Daddy? Daddy, don't. No, Erik! In you come! Come on! It's OK. You're OK. You're OK. You are. You are. Let's get them out of here quickly and calmly. Follow me. Do you want me to get you some water? No, I'm all right. OK. (Baby cries) Linda? Yeah. First one? Yeah. Just lay there. Can you shut the door, please? Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. Can you bring up your top a bit. Loosen your trousers. There we are. Sit down then. Right. OK. It's cold! Are you the dad? Yeah. Dad, you're  my  dad. No, no, sorry, yeah-- I'm her dad. There's not as much room as there was. See if we can... (Heart beats) There we are. There's a couple of legs. Arms. OK? All looking good. All right? Yeah. What do you want to be? Sorry? What do you want to be? Grandad? Gramps? Mother-father? We should get you moving. Yeah. Grandad will be fine. I'll get it, I'll do it. Go on. In the car.
