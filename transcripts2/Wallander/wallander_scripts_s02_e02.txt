 Kurt? 
 Hello, Sten. 
 At the guesthouse... the landlady said you'd be down here. 
 She said you're always down here - every day, for months. 
 Ever since... 
 They said my father must have been driving too fast. 
 Lost control or skidded off the road, killed outright. 
 But...I just can't accept that. 
 The car key was on the floor of the car. 
 How does that happen? 
 Car keys don't just fall out of car ignitions, even after a crash. 
 You turn the key through four positions - it's now locked in the starting position, so how did it fall out on the floor? 
 Somebody from the emergency services pulled it out. 
 OK, but they said he must have been speeding. 
 You knew Gustaf, Kurt. 
 He was an old man. He drove like an old man. 
 My father drove like an old man even when he was a young man. 
 Kurt, please. 
 All I'm asking is... just look over the file. For me. 
 I know you're... 
 I'm sorry, Sten. 
 Can't help you. 
 Not any more. 
 How was it? 
 Hmm? 
 Oh, it was lovely. That was, er... Thanks. Yeah. 
 What's wrong, Kurt? 
 Miles away. 
 It was that guy, wasn't it? 
 Last week. 
 You've been brooding ever since. 
 Who was he? 
 Old friend. 
 A solicitor. 
 His, um...his father was killed in a car accident. 
 And? 
 A couple of things that didn't add up. 
 He asked me to look over it. I... Anna... 
 I thought you were going to resign. You'd made your mind up. 
 I have. I... 
 I'll see you in the morning. 
 Go back, Kurt. 
 You're no good to anyone until you sort this out. 
 I don't know if I'm ready to go... 
 Go. 
 Just go. 
 Please. 
 (Man speaks indistinctly over pa) 
 (He clicks switch back and forth) Phew! 'Hello. You've reached the mobile phone of Sten Torstensson.' 'Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.' (Voicemail beeps) Er, Sten, it's Kurt...er, Wallander. I'm back. Er, I'm in Ystad. I've got to go to the station, so if I hear anything about your father, I'll, um...I'll let you know. Er...er, right. (Drill whines) (Phone rings, noisy hubbub) (Siren wails) Put the date on it. And can I see your driver's licence, please? Hey, Thomas, where are you going with that box? Thanks a lot, guys! Sorry, man. Kurt? Kurt! Are you all right? Lisa. Um... What are you doing here? We didn't expect you back for weeks. Yeah, I need to talk. I've been, um... Well, do you want to come through? Say, who... who's that lady? I recognise her. That's Helene Duner, Sten Torstensson's secretary. Look, I'm afraid there's bad news, Kurt. Sten's dead. No. Sten... Gustaf's dead, Sten's father. Gustaf was killed in a car accident. Sten hanged himself last night. Mrs Duner found his body this morning. Kurt Wallander. He said you were his last hope. Where were you? (He breathes heavily) (Engine turns over) (Engine stops) (Engine turns over) (Ignition fires) Gustaf Torstensson's car. Mm-hm. (Police radio blares indistinctly) Is this exactly how it was brought in? Yeah. (He grunts) (Lock clicks four times) (Wallander grunts) (Musical ring tone plays) (Ring tone continues playing) Hello? (Church clock chimes) It arrived some weeks ago. I said Sten should take it to the police. "You will all die and who will profit then? You are worthless." Sten said it must have come from some old client, someone with a grudge. He wanted to throw it away. I kept it. Something about it felt...unfinished. And now this. Father and son. Where did Sten, er...? At his office. That's something else I don't understand. To do that, knowing I would find him... You should show this to the police. I'm showing it to you, Kurt. You can't walk away again. Right, let's see if I've got this. You examine Gustaf Torstensson's car and you don't think the key fell out during the accident. You then found the boot was locked. When you opened it, you found a three-legged kitchen chair in it. You then found the missing chair leg at the site of the accident, which means - and stop me from getting carried away here - somebody must have put the chair in the boot after the car crash and not realised the leg had broken off. So the car accident was a set-up. Old man Torstensson had his neck broken and then whoever did it rolled the car down the hill with the old man in it? And put a kitchen chair in the boot, which, presumably, he brought along to have a bit of a sit down, cos murder can actually be quite exhausting. Magnus. No, I'm sorry, Lisa. This was my case. Everything was quite clear. Everything adds up. What about the son? Sten. I suppose we've missed another one there. That could mean anything. (She sighs) This is all a bit circumstantial, Kurt. Kurt, we should talk in the morning. You know, we can review this again. I'm sure there's something in what you say. It's really good to see you, Kurt. Are you OK? Sten Torstensson. The larynx and the windpipe were both crushed. Now, obviously, you'd expect severe constriction injuries, but look. The hyoid bone, it lives here. I got them to resect it. Fractured in five places. Sten was hanging from a beam - that would indicate a vertical drop, which would dislocate the upper vertebrae of the spinal column resulting in death. But a fractured hyoid... that's usually caused by a blow. In the old days, bare-knuckle fighters, very common injury - a rabbit punch to the throat resulting in a crushed windpipe and suffocation. Martial arts competitions, that's where you see it nowadays. Of course, it would all make perfect sense if Sten had pitched forward before the drop. I just wondered what you thought. What was the cause given for the old man's death? Gustaf? Broken neck. Wearing his seatbelt? It can happen. That's what I told Sten. Where's the old man's body? It's going to be a long night, isn't it? (He snores quietly) (Mobile phone rings) Hello? Kurt, it's me, Nyberg. Gustaf Torstensson - hyoid fractured in four places. OK, thanks for that. 'Yeah, see you tomorrow.' Yeah, in the morning. You had no authority to ask for another postmortem on Gustaf Torstensson, you know that. I don't understand. You suddenly appear after months away, God knows where. No warning. This was Magnus's case. You've got no right doing this. Sten came to see me. He knew there was something wrong. I turned him away and I... I just think that I should try to...just put this right. OK, Kurt. But what about you? Huh? Are you in a fit state? Look at you, you're sweating. You were shaking last night, we all saw it. Now, you chose to take sick leave. There's no way you can breeze in here and take over someone else's investigation. You should have a full medical examination. Don't want to try and take over anyone's investigation, I just, uh... want to help. I'm...I'm fine. Fine, really. Are you? OK. You want to work - you wear that at all times. You know what the book says. Carrying a side-arm weapon and being prepared to use it is fundamental to being a police officer. You can use your old office. Magnus will brief you in an hour. Holgersson : OK, Magnus, tell Kurt what you've got. Right, we established that Gustaf Torstensson had been at Farnholm Castle the day of the accident. Now, we assumed he'd been driving home. Farnholm Castle. Alfred Harderberg. The philanthropist guy. According to Mrs Duner, the Torstensson firm of solicitors have become almost exclusively involved in managing and advising in Harderberg's affairs. You've already spoken to him, haven't you, Magnus? Yes, I was given five minutes with him on the phone. He was in Africa. He's got a bunch of projects out there, part of the Harderberg Foundation. Hospitals, schools - it's big stuff. The guy's mega-loaded. Do you think I could talk to him? Would that be OK? Like to talk to him. (He beeps car horn) Kurt Wallander. Ekman. Anders Ekman. Malmo Central, yeah? Hello. So... Are you on duty? Well... It's just that I, um... I heard that you'd packed it all in. Well, where did you hear that? Well, I still talk to a few of the guys. You work here? Security assistant. Basically, I open and close the gate. It pays well. I can't complain. Harderberg's a good boss. Nice guy. I always thought you got a rough deal. It's a long time ago. You've got to move on. I'm OK. I'm good. Good. I've got an appointment. It's about the accident, the old guy. Harderberg's solicitor. Get in, I'll let you through. All right. Thanks. (He starts engine) (Doorbell chimes) Sorry. I've got an appointment with Mr Harderberg. Kurt Wallander? I'm Alfred Harderberg. Come on in. Sorry, I though there'd be, um... What, lackeys? I'm not so grand I can't answer the bloody door. Come through. This business with Gustaf and Sten is awful. Everyone here's in a bit of a state of shock. If there's anything we can do... Murdered? Well, we don't think the deaths are quite as they initially appeared. Isn't that just police-speak for "murdered"? Why? Have you any idea? That's why I'm here. We need to build up a picture of the two men. (Harderberg sighs) Can you tell me what Gustaf did with you that day? Um, he delivered some papers, um... just things that needed my signature. Can you remember what time he left? We will need to try to plot his movements, if we can. It'll be on the records, I imagine. I can get them to you. Thank you. Exactly what kind of work did Gustaf do for you? Standard legal advice - some Swedish tax law, VAT, import/export licences. And he did a lot of work with the foundation. Gustaf and Sten are going to be a big loss, both personally and professionally. There was a card that we found in Sten's desk. I can't quite work it out, but we think it's some kind of threat. I wondered if it meant anything to you at all. You didn't report this? I get them all the time. Not this one specifically, but death threats like that. When did this arrive? A couple of days ago - that's why it's still in the drawer. But, um, obviously this one is... a bit more significant than I'd thought. I'll need to take this and any envelope it came in, please. Of course. I think you should keep your people alerted until we sort this out. Thanks very much for your time, Mr Harderberg. These are from your foundation? Yes, that's right. Yes. I'm lucky. I'm stinking rich. (Both laugh) I come from a wealthy family and I always took it for granted. People like me always do, no matter what they tell you. Then I went to Africa on business a few years ago and I couldn't believe it - the poverty, the filth, the stench. But it wasn't that that got me, it was the dignity. People living in sh1t, smiling at you. Little children, smiling, and you knew that two months later, they'd be dead. And I just thought "Not if I can help it. Not any more." Do you have any children? Yes. I have a daughter. Never happened for me. It's one of those things you think "How didn't that happen, when I've got everything else?" And I think that's partly why I do this, in some probably appallingly egocentric way. What do you mean? All these little children in Africa are my children. They're my family. Yeah, I know, it's easy to sneer, but... I wasn't sneering. Well, call me if you want to meet again. I'm around for a while. I will. Thanks. Thank you. OK? Yeah. Thanks. It's good to see you. And you. Maybe we should go for a drink sometime. Yeah. Yeah, let's do that. Yeah. Great. Thanks. Torstensson, Harderberg. Same card, same handwriting, and we now assume were sent by the killer. So is it definitely some kind of death threat? "You will all die and who will profit then? You're worthless." "You will all die" - seems fairly clear. "And who will profit then?" Might be some kind of revenge thing. Somebody who's been screwed. Whatever it is seems to link Torstensson and Harderberg. Maybe it's something to do with their business together. Yeah. What did you make of him? Um...I believed him. Believed him? I believed what he talked about - Africa, you know, what he does. He seemed genuinely upset by the Torstenssons' deaths. And Ekman said he thought he was kosher. Ekman? Anders Ekman. Former policeman. He works for Harderberg now as a sort of gateman. Ekman? Now, why do I know that name? Malmo. He was discharged a few years back. He killed someone, didn't he? Driving too fast in an unmarked car. A teenage girl - got an 18-month suspended sentence. Got slung out of the force for that one. No light. No siren. The girl didn't stand a chance. Yeah, well, it could've happened to any of us. Shouldn't we get these cards to...? Yeah, we'll get them to the lab. We need to find out more about Torstensson's business with Harderberg. Yeah. Kurt, are you OK? Sure. Yeah. Just a bit, er... Just need a bit of air. It's a bit stuffy in here. (Knock at door) (Knock at door) Wallander. They gave me some computer printouts to give you. The arrivals and departures from the castle. What are you doing here? Well, I thought I'd deliver them by hand. Did you follow me? Yeah. I was a good cop. I thought we could have that drink. They don't need me back yet. Yeah, I'm, er... I'm busy... Kristina Vanska. She'd be 28 now. I think about her... every day. Took me a year before I could get back in a car. Finished me. Then the booze got me. Wife pissed off. Kids gave up with me. It wasn't pretty. What got you back? Too much of a coward to die, I suppose. But, Kurt, you're lucky. You killed a murderer - a guy who was pointing a gun down your throat. I killed an innocent teenage girl. I'll pay for mine for the rest of my life. You don't have to. This is all completely standard stuff, comings and goings. Mail vans, laundry. I'll leave it with you, shall I? Yes, thanks. Yeah. (He rattles pill bottle) 'Hi. This is Linda.' 'Please leave a message and I'll get back to you. Thanks.' (Answering machine beeps) Hi. Hi. It's me...your dad, in case you'd forgotten. I'm here and, er...er... I'm back in Ystad. So I hope you're OK. Er... (He yawns) Oh, Christ! (He groans) (He sighs) OK, so these postcards - we can't place the image, this village. The cardboard's cheap, it's generic, so there's nothing to narrow it down. But the envelope which we picked up from Mrs Duner has an embossed mark. The Eider Duck Hotel. It's a hotel outside Jonkoping on Lake Vattern. It was posted on 8th July and sent from the hotel. I tried to get hold of them. Nobody's answering the phone. I'll keep trying. I know this place. I...used to go there with my dad. Do come in. We're just through here. It's been a lovely day, hasn't it? Hans. I'll just, er, get the register. There we are. Now, it was...July, you said? July, yes. Here we are. Mr and Mrs Timglas. A retired German couple. Um...anyone else? Er... just him. Jurgen Nordfeldt. Is there an address? We threw out all the registration forms when we closed. I remember him, though. A gentleman...late 40s. Early 50s. Anything else that you remember about him? Well...there was a young lady. Mr Nordfeldt drank far too much. And there was this young woman came to visit him. Well, they had a very long and loud argument in the dining room. Shouting. Who was she? Oh... Her name was Nordfeldt too. Elin, I think. Yes, Elin. I called her a taxi for the airport. Er...wife? Daughter, maybe? She was too young to be his wife. You don't know that. 50's no age now. Thank you very much...for your help. You've been very kind. I actually know this place. I...used to come here when I was a boy... with my...dad. We know who you are - Kurt Wallander. Yes. Povel Wallander's boy. You used to love the animals. The animals, yeah. That's right. The place was full of animals. My husband's great talent was taxidermy. Until his eyes got too old... and his fingers. And what happened to the animals? We had to throw them out. Rotten, like everything else. Is your father still alive? He's, er... Yes. Remember us to him, won't you? Yes. I will. Magnus, I've got names. Jurgen and Elin Nordfeldt. See what you can dig up. Hello, Dad. Hmm? Hello, Dad. Linda, I... don't understand. I come down every couple of weeks. You'd know that if you... No, I...I tried to call you. I was busy. Family reunion, is it? Family reunion? I'm...I'm sorry, Dad. I've been... away. Holiday? It's all holiday with you people now, isn't it? No. I've, er... (He sighs) I'm off now, Grandad. Grandad, I'm off now. You've a lot to catch up on. Don't go yet, please. I have to get back. No, no, no. Don't go. The trains, they're dangerous. It's OK, Grandad. They crash. They crash. Grandad, I'll be fine. You. You can go. Go. Don't you leave, good girl. Beautiful girl. I've got money in my pocket, pocket money. No, no, no. Oh. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. (Povel whimpers) It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Dad, we should let her go. (Povel moans) God, I'm... Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, God. Oh, it's all right. Dad, get a nurse. (Povel groans) Dad, get a nurse! Nurse. Nurse! Nurse! (Povel sobs) It's all right. It's all right. It's all right, Mr Wallander. Just take my arm. That's it. I'll take your weight. OK, that's it. Thanks. I tried to get in touch with you, Dad... so many times. How could you just leave everyone? We're your family. Maybe we just could have helped. You always turn away. Please, Linda, just give me a bit of a break. It's like we're out there somewhere, way out on the edge of your life. That's just... That's not true, Linda. I killed a man. I couldn't handle it, OK? I didn't know what I was doing. I just needed to get some silence, some space. I don't know. Why have you come back now? Why, Dad? A man came to me for help. I turned him away and now he's dead. What do I have to do, Dad? What do any of us have to do? Die? Would that do it for you? I'm so sorry. (Car horn honks) My taxi. Don't go yet. The train's booked. Please, Linda. 
 
 (Car door closes, engine starts) I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for. Anything that connects the name Jurgen Nordfeldt to the firm. Perhaps he was an old client with a grievance of some sort? I don't think so. It's not that kind of business. It's much more a question of Customs practices, bills of lading, shipping regulations. What about the foundation? The firm dealt with that as well. That was very much Gustaf's domain. He did all that from home. From home? Why was that? I don't know. That's what he always did. (He sighs) So Sten was working here that night, Mrs Duner? Yes. He was alone. So he could have let someone in? Someone he knew? Of course. Have you any idea what he was working on? He was helping Gustaf with the foundation work. So he could have been working on that here, yes? Well, I suppose so. Gustaf was getting very tired. Mr Harderberg is a good man but a hard taskmaster. And Gustaf lived alone? His wife died some years ago. Who's looking after the house? Do you have a key? Mm-hm. He worked down here, always alone. Here. Thank you. (He jiggles door handle) Oh, I'm sorry. Gustaf was the only one with a key. Is there a window? We're underground. No-one else had a key? Sten. Sten gave me Gustaf's car key. If those things are genuine, they're worth a fortune. Why keep them hidden down here? Did you know he had these? I had no idea. Was Gustaf very wealthy? I mean, was there family money? Not to my knowledge. That's a lot of money. There's nothing here. He kept all the foundation work here. I know he did. What's this? I don't know. You sure no-one else had a key to this room? I suppose Sten might have, but only Sten. It's like some kind of space-age picnic hamper. Wait. I think this bar code contains product ID. VAT registration data. It might link it to some kind of EU export product database. Um... Oh, give me your mobile, will you? Great. Thanks. You said this room was full of icons, more than Gustaf could ever have afforded. One key with Gustaf and maybe one with Sten. So Sten could have taken those papers, or Gustaf himself. But what's the connection to Jurgen Nordfeldt? OK, match found. Right, Antvardan Plastics and Composites fabrication plant in Ostersund. "Suppliers in specialist plastic mouldings, high-impact resins, heat-proof injection mouldings... Company details - personnel. List of current employees..." There. There. There. Jurgen Nordfeldt. Senior Dispatches Manager. That's him. Hi, this is Detective Hoglund, Ystad Police. Can you put me through to your human resources department, please? Jurgen Nordfeldt, senior manager in dispatches, and we need to know... Yes. I see. Have you got a photograph on file by any chance? ...Good. As soon as we get that picture, get it to the folk at the Eider Duck Hotel. Right. I need you to e-mail that... I should warn Harderberg. Left without notice, beginning of the month. Don't know where he went and nobody's heard from him. There's thousands of these boxes on the website. No idea what it is, though. Finally getting yourself a new liver, then, Kurt? You know what that is, don't you? No. It's an organ transplant container. No. I don't recognise him. What did you say his name was? Jurgen Nordfeldt. And you think he sent the cards? Definitely, but he's gone missing. Sit down. Would you like a beer? (Bottles clink) Very tempting. But no, I won't. Thank you. You're very kind. So what does this guy do? Plastics factory, dispatches manager. This is serious, isn't it? Two people have already been killed, and you received one of these cards. Mmm. What else do you know about this guy? Nothing. There's a niece we're trying to track down, Elin, who's a doctor. Have you any way of checking their names against people who may have worked for the foundation? The Torstenssons kept a database of volunteer movements, I think, for visa details and suchlike. But Torstensson kept the foundation's paperwork at his home. Yes, I know. It's missing, I'm afraid. His office was stripped. There's no records, no database, no hard drives. There's nothing. I don't understand. I think it's possible that there may be some significant fraud here. Against me? Against the foundation. I know it's unlikely, but... No, no. It's not unlikely at all. It happens in a small way every day. It's virtually impossible to keep up with the daily flow of capital in an organisation like mine. I'm sorry, but I'd suggest you do what you need to to check it out. In the meantime, till we find Jurgen Nordfeldt, you should consider your movements very carefully. We'd like to offer you security. No, no. I'm fine, thank you. I'm very well protected. Oh, here's the man himself. You've met Karl Sjolander. He looks after me. He's very capable. I'll pass on your thoughts, though. All right, then. Well, thanks again for your time. (Phone rings) Hello, Magnus. You called earlier? Look, these printouts from Farnholm Castle, there's something I don't get. They're straightforward. Torstensson leaves about half an hour after he got there. Oh, no. It's not Torstensson. You see, according to these, his is the only car to have left the castle between the hour of 08.29 and 09.34. Well, when we did the accident investigation, we interviewed a couple of hikers on the road that morning, and they said they thought another car passed them before Torstensson's car, about ten minutes ahead. Yeah, and? There are no feed roads between the castle and the site of Torstensson's death. So that car must have come from the castle. If there was one. OK. Thanks, Magnus. That, um...printout you gave me... Yeah. Did you do that? No. I just sit here, looking at screens and opening gates. You see that? That's on me. Make sure I don't fall asleep. Were you on that day - Torstensson's accident? No, I try not to do weekends if I can help it. Is there a problem? It's...it's a bit of a cock-up with the printout. One of my guys seems to think that another car left the castle a few minutes before the old man, but the printout says not. Sjolander deals with that. Harderberg's man. He thinks he's a technical genius. He's not. Want me to check it out? I just need to... Eliminate it. Yeah. All right, thanks. Take care, Kurt. (Mobile phone rings) Hello? Hoglund : We found her. Elin Nordfeldt. Got in from Mozambique three days ago. She's in Tomelilla this evening giving a slideshow Q&A in the town hall. Good. Thanks. (Woman speaks in background) In some parts of Sudan, Medicins Sans Frontieres doctors have become the sole provider of healthcare - sometimes even of food and water. Children, civilians, bear the brunt of endless conflict... their way of life destroyed. They have no security, no future, no hope - just what relief we can bring them. Mutilations are commonplace. We see sharp-weapon trauma inflicted on all ages. Some of these people simply give up on life. We in the West have become inured to these images. It's called "compassion fatigue". "Victim overload". This young woman is my age. Her name is Sasha. They held Sasha down and hacked off her hands with a machete. (Murmuring) Now, compassion fatigue or not, this is happening. And the time to help is now. (Mouths) Thank you very much. I enjoyed the lecture. If, um..."enjoy" is the word. Thanks. Forms are at the back, if you want to join the mailing list. Actually, I'm a police officer. I wonder if there's somewhere we could go and talk about your uncle. Waiter : Here we are. So tell me a bit about Jurgen. What about him? I'm told that you and he had a bit of a shouting match at the Eider Duck Hotel. What's that got to do with you? Sorry, I don't understand. Why are you so nervous? I'm not. Doesn't everyone get nervous around police? Anyway, how do I know you are police? Look, I'll show you... Oh, sorry, I have, um... Well, you just have to take my word for it. I don't think so. Please, wait, wait. Please. Please. Just sit down. Do you, um... Do you recognise this place? No. This is your uncle's handwriting, yes? Yes. Why would your uncle issue death threats? Well, it's not necessarily a death threat, is it? "You will all die." That's... Well, it's a simple statement of fact. Have you seen this before? You have, haven't you? Jurgen sent two of these. One to a firm of solicitors - a father and son. Sten and Gustaf Torstensson. Do you know them? No. Both murdered. Sent the other to a man called Harderberg. Do you know Alfred Harderberg? No. Why are you frightened? I have to go. Please, Elin! Please. Please, Elin, tell me what this means. The girl who was mutilated, Sasha... I told my uncle how she came in to the clinic. I found a bed for her. Next time I saw her was in the mortuary three days later. There wasn't much of Sasha left. 120,000. That's the value of a human body if it's properly processed and packaged. UN Biomedics and Ethics Committee. Their figures. 120,000 for a body full of healthy organs. I'm sorry. Elin? No, no, um... Elin. Hey. Hey. Oh, yeah. Yeah... Oh, sorry, sorry. Excuse me. The bill? Elin! Elin! Elin! Elin, please, just wait. (Clicks switch) Oh, for...! (Crashing) (Birds chirp) (Mobile phone rings) He...hello? Kurt Wallander? Yeah, who's this, please? This is Jurgen Nordfeldt. Where are you? Elin's dead. This has got to stop. Jurgen, where are you? Cab...cab...cabin 22, Ringsjolm Trailer Park. It's OK. I know it. I know it. Stay where you are. Don't move. I'm on my way. You stay where you are! (Tyres screech) Jurgen! Jurgen! (Gasps) Jurgen, stay with me. Stay with me, Jurgen. Uh... Yeah, Wallander. Ambulance, urgent. Er... Um... Berth 22, Ringsjolm Trailer Park. I repeat - urgent! Jurgen, Jurgen, stay. Right, stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me, Jurgen! (Splutters) Stay with me, Jurgen! Stay with me. You're going to be OK. You're going to be OK. (Squelch) Stay with me, Jurgen. Stay with me. (Jurgen gasps) OK, Jurgen. (Wallander whispers urgently) Stay with me, Jurgen. (Whispers) (Air hisses through pen) Yes, Jurgen. Yes, Jurgen. Let me hear you breathe, Jurgen. (Air blows) (Fluid gargles) (Breathes) Yes, Jurgen. (Siren blares) (Police chatter on radio) Kurt? So naive. Who? Elin and Jurgen. I think they were trying to nail Harderberg by using the Torstenssons. Some kind of philanthropic blackmail. There are lists of projects that they were demanding that he increased his funding to. So, what have they got on Harderberg? (Phone rings) Magnus? He's with me. There's a connection. Torstensson placed an order with Antvardan Plastics. Six container loads of organ transplant boxes for the Sudan. Now, Customs and Excise designates them as medical equipment, so before you can export them you need an end-user certificate. But by redesignating the boxes as soft-drink coolers, Torstensson avoided Customs and Excise scrutiny. There are 800 of them. 800! Same as the ones in Torstensson's house? The polypropylene is double skinned, so you can fill the cavity with liquid nitrogen. That's a thermometer. The temperature's crucial. Any organ warmer than 12 degrees Centigrade would be unfit for transplant. Now, I contacted the Royal General in Stockholm and asked them how many of these they might be likely to order in a year. How many? No more than 12. Body parts. He's trading in body parts from Africa. Torstensson? Harderberg. This is what they were trying to blackmail him with. Elin knew about this and persuaded her uncle to get involved. 120,000 for a human body. And then I gave him Elin and Nordfeldt's names. I gave them to him. Martinsson : Alfred Harderberg?! I can't believe that. Why would he need to do sh1t like that? We've got him, haven't we? This will all be in Torstensson's name. Why would Sten come and talk to you in the first place about his father, if he was already involved in all this? Mrs Duner said that Sten had only just started working on the foundation's business. I think he must have known something was wrong, that his father had got involved, and was taking pay-offs from Harderberg to cover something up. He knew that I'd work out what it was. Why can't we nail Harderberg? Because nothing will lead specifically back to Harderberg. Absolutely nothing - I can guarantee that. I suppose what really interests me is why you're here. I've told you. Yeah, a list of grotesque, unfounded allegations without a shred of proof. You're not here to arrest me. We both know that. In fact, I'm willing to bet that nobody else even knows you're here. I'm fairly certain you're not wired up, and it wouldn't surprise me if you weren't even armed, given your recent history. Well, I believed you. Africa. The foundation. I meant it. Every word. My children, my family. You've got so many questions... haven't you, rattling around inside your head? Look, you killed a man recently. A racist killer, killed in self-defence in the line of duty. A perfectly reasonable course of action. Then you ran away... into the wilderness for six months - sweating, shaking - and it wouldn't leave you, would it? And all the time you had this one big question nagging away at you - does your pain make you a good man or a weak man? I took... a life. Exactly. It's life or death. Who lives, who dies? Who decides? Was a racist killer's life worth as much as yours? You know it wasn't. In your heart, you know it wasn't. That's what you're running away from. Nobody has the right to make those kinds of decisions. I didn't say it was my right. It's my strength. Who lives, who dies. My family, my children. I decide. (Scoffs) (Door closes) (Keys jingle) (Exhales) Did you ever pray? (Scoffs) Pray? When you went off? After you shot that guy. Why would I pray? I don't know. Forgiveness. Did you? I did, yeah. But not for forgiveness. I prayed... that they'd let me back. Wallander : Back? In the force. Some day. That's what I wanted. I was a good cop. I know. Do you? I knew you. I knew who you were. Yeah? Sure. (Glasses clink) I miss it. Every day. Every minute. Being part of it, belonging. Respect. I'm nothing now. But you - you're still there. So what have you got? Open it. It's Torstensson. Leaving the castle on the day he was killed. Who's in the BMW? Sjolander - Harderberg's man - on all the cameras. Sjolander left ten minutes before the old man. You were right. There's your proof. They doctored the lists they sent you. What's going on? You don't know? Harderberg...has been involved in trading body parts from Africa. Organs for transplant. Hundreds of them. Gustaf was in on it and I think he got scared and Harderberg had him killed. I thought he was too good to be true. You going to nail him? I'm going to nail his henchman. That's a start. I want back in. You know that's not going to happen. Well, you can make it happen. Anders... You're Kurt Wallander. People listen to you. I'm just an inspector. You know how it works. I do know how it works. Look...write me a letter. Talk to someone. Put in a word, bend an ear. I'm sorry, Anders. Listen. Kurt, please... please listen to me. You killed someone. You took a life. You walk away, you bang your head against a wall, you wonder, "Can I still be a cop?" I killed someone. An accident. I can't be a cop...ever again. I don't have a choice! You have the choice. Give me the choice again. Just do that. He might have given us Harderberg. There must be something you can do. You can't do deals for information. Come on, we do deals all the time. Not to bring a killer back in to the force. He's done his time. He deserves a break. He killed someone, Kurt. Yeah, and so did I. What you did was in the line of duty. He was just unlucky. He broke the rules, he has to pay. Sure, he broke the rules, he had an accident, and a girl died and it was awful, but it was an accident, Lisa. Nothing Harderberg does is an accident. It's murder hundreds of times over. People are dying because he's decided they're worth no more than the sum total of their body parts, and you're talking to me about Anders Ekman and rules?! (Opens, closes door) (Phone rings) Hello? Ekman : They're leaving. Sorry. What do you mean? Harderberg, Sjolander. The private jet's got a slot out of Stockholm at 1.30. They're taking the chopper in 30 minutes. Sjolander called me to help shut the place up. Anders, leave it. It's all right, Kurt. I'm here. I can do this. Anders! Anders. Come on, Anders. Anders? Open the gate. Won't open, I've tried. Must have shut the power down at the castle. Right. We wait. I'm calling for backup. No time. Sjolander's firing up the chopper. Anders, wait! (Grunts) (Gunfire) (Helicopter rotor whirrs) Stop! (Fires gun) Or I'll shoot. (Chuckles) (Chuckles) BANG! BANG! Argh! (Harderberg groans) Argh! Argh! Aargh! Anders? (Breathes rapidly) Back in. I'm back in. You're back in. (Church clock chimes) (Phone rings) Wallander.
