 Something's up. 
 We can't do this. 
 Tie it up. 
 I can't, this isn't right. 
 Just do it. 
 I'm not doing it. 
 Jacobsen! 
 Get off! 
 Wallander Season 3 - Episode 02 
 "The Dogs of Riga" 
 Morning. Excuse me. 
 Sorry. Sorry. 
 Wallander. 
 No, I was awake. 
 Sir. 
 Thanks. 
 Whoever shot them did them a kindness. 
 The mouths were burnt out with chemicals. 
 Destroyed the tongue and the gums. 
 And their fingers have been broken. 
 When did they die? 
 Well, it's hard to tell, with the sun and the gulls. 
 A few days. 
 They're mafia tattoos, aren't they? 
 Russian. 
 Yeah. 
 The buildings are from the town where they'll be based. 
 You recognise any of them? 
 I don't know. 
 Could be anywhere east of the Baltic. 
 All OK? 
 Other than this? 
 Fine. Fine. 
 Don't give yourself a hard time about what happened. 
 How is she? 
 Ann-Britt? 
 Fine. You... you should speak to her consultant. 
 She's not awake. 
 She's alive. 
 So, I sent the tattoo photos out through Europol. 
 Didn't want to scare them with the faces. 
 They're Russian tattoos. 
 Yeah, Russian tattoos, but the bodies are from Latvia. 
 That's where Riga is, right? 
 Yeah, let me see. 
 Let's get everyone together, then. 
 So is there a detective from Riga on his way? 
 Kurt Wallander? 
 Yeah. 
 Karlis Liepa. 
 We're this way. 
 The roses are initiation symbols for the gang. 
 Gravestones are the time they've spent in prison. 
 They mourn for the lost time. 
 Do you know who they are? 
 I couldn't read the dates on the gravestones. 
 It was '06 to '08, the first body and '02 to '08, the other one. 
 Who are they? 
 You didn't send me photos of the faces. 
 No. 
 It was sulphuric acid. Concentrated. It's industrial. 
 They dilute it to fill up car batteries. 
 This one is called Kalns. 
 That's Leja. 
 They were captains in a gang called Radnieciba. 
 Ethnic Russians. 
 They both left Ventspils in a boat seven nights ago. 
 How do you know them? 
 Where's the raft? Can I see that? 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 The raft itself is about 25 years old. Made in Yugoslavia, they were exported mainly in Eastern Europe. 
 We took photos obviously. 
 Good. 
 Then you can give me copies. 
 What do you make of it? 
 Did you talk to the newspapers about this? 
 No, we didn't. 
 Good. 
 Why d'you want to know? 
 Do you have a fax machine? 
 Yeah. 
 I'd like to use it. 
 It's just back down the corridor. 
 Did this go? 
 Who did you send it to? 
 My superiors. 
 Did this go? 
 Yes, yes, it went. 
 Good. Very good. 
 I could drink a beer now, do you want to come? 
 No, I want you to tell me what you know. 
 I think it was an accident it landed here. 
 Your job is finished, Kurt. Let's go for a beer. 
 I'm not sending those bodies back until we know what we're dealing with here in Sweden. 
 Understood? 
 Fine. 
 Keep the bodies. 
 Nobody mourns these men. 
 Excuse me... 
 Yeah, Wallander. 
 I've got some information on the dead men in the life raft. 
 I'll be on the east quay at Simirishamn. 
 An hour and a half. Keep it quiet. Who...? Who...? Enjoy your beer. I saw the raft. It's marked. 2.25pm, the 12th. Drifting south. So why didn't you tow it in? I saw what was inside it. And you'd be a fisherman? Yeah. So why all this intrigue, then? What are you doing? OK, OK, just... Yeah? Kurt, we've been broken into. The raft had cocaine hidden in the base. It was shredded. We were set up. It was a diversion. Right, thanks. Major! Oh, come... Hello. Who took the drugs from the raft? They're gone? Yeah, and I think that you knew that they were there and I think you knew that they'd go. So please tell me what's happening, because I'm not beyond arresting you. Fine, go ahead. Arrest me. Please. Ten years in a nice Swedish prison. That would be just great for me. Right, this is the last time I'm going to ask. These men, these boys, they had their mouths burnt, burnt like that, because they'd been talking - to me, my informants. It's... it's my fault, Kurt, my fault. You can't... You can't start thinking like that. It's the fault of whoever poured acid on them. Come on. Come on. I'll make you something to eat. That was a nice dinner. Thanks, you're welcome. Are you sure you want another one of those? Yeah. Cheers. Cheers. Your wife won't mind me smoking? I think it's pretty obvious by now, Karlis, that I don't have a wife. It's not easy to be a policeman and be married. Not easy to be anybody and be married. Not easy to be anybody and be... whatever. Will you tell me who that fax you sent actually went to? I sent it, I hoped it wouldn't get into the wrong hands. But obviously, it did. And whose hands were the wrong hands? The man who tortured them...maybe. You think you know who that is? No, not really. No, not really until I go back. Is he with the same gang? You ever been responsible for someone else's pain, like that? You ever been the man to blame for something like that happening to someone? I have to know about it, Karlis. This is a drugs route into Sweden. The bodies washed up on our territory. I can't let this go. I don't know anything for definite until I go back. But you have a theory. I have a theory. Yeah. We work on theories. We share them. Come on! This is my theory. I think I got myself too involved. Yeah, but you have protection, yeah? The police have protection? In Latvia? No, Kurt. Well, now, we can try to help on our side, I mean, even if you're in trouble, you should know that. Hey, enough. You should stay here tonight. We'll talk about it in the morning. I'll get some bedclothes for you. Nice place to hide the drugs, Kurt, wasn't it? If I was hiding something, I would hide it in plain sight. Is this OK for you? There you go, present for you. We give them to all official visitors. I've got stacks of them. Enjoy. All right? Yeah. Right. Thanks, Kurt. Yeah. Night-night. Night. Karlis? So let's assume the drugs were meant to come here, presumably from Latvia, or from Ventspils the Major said, there was somebody in Sweden on the receiving end, who knew enough and had enough personnel ruthless enough, determined enough just to come and take them. Who do you think that man on the causeway was? Do you know, I think... my instinct is that he was just a fisherman. He was in way over his head. He looked scared. D'you mind if Kurt and I just...? We'll do this later. Sure. I've just had a call from Riga. I'm sorry. Major Liepa is dead. He was murdered there last night. The Riga Police, they'd like you to go out to help with the... Right. Yes. We can handle it over the phone you don't have to go... No, I'll go. I'll go. It's important. I'd like to help. OK, good. Colonel Wallander. Thank you. I'm Sergeant Zids. Welcome to Riga. Where are we going? Major Leipa's funeral. Now? Here we are, Colonel. Down there. Thanks for coming. I'm very sorry about the Major. This is Colonel Murnieks. We were Karlis' superiors. Myself and Colonel Putnis need to interrogate you as quickly as possible, if you can. Sure. I never lost one officer, in 27 years of duty, not even during independence. Mrs. Liepa. This is the Colonel from Sweden. He's going to help us. Baiba. Kurt. Kurt. I'm very, very sorry about your husband. You gave him a book... about Sweden. Yes, that's right. He liked it very much. Widows are very beautiful. Shall we go? Just after 11pm, the Major got a phone call on his landline. He told his wife he'd been called in to police headquarters. The call didn't come from us. He was investigating gangs? He was undercover drugs squad, mostly the new heroin and cocaine routes. He was very experienced. We didn't stand over his shoulder. I wonder if you had the feeling that the that the Major was holding something back from you? I'm sad to say he didn't tell us he was going to Sweden until he got there. No, I didn't feel he was holding anything back. Some children found him here. His body was still warm. He'd been shot through the back of the head, around 6am. Had he been tortured? Does his wife know? She didn't see the corpse. We assume there's a connection between whatever Karlis was working on and his killing. But, as I said, he'd been keeping us at arm's length. It's hard to know. Did he have the same injuries as the men who were killed on the raft? We don't know about their injuries. We haven't seen their bodies. But you've seen the initial report? All Major Liepa's case notes are gone. No, I'm not talking about his case notes. I mean, his initial report, the fax he sent you from Sweden. What fax? Did you get a fax? I didn't get anything from him. Well, I saw him send it on Friday afternoon to his superiors, he said. OK. We'll check our call register. Here is where he worked. This has been searched, yes? For his case notes. Yes. And... you're certain that he actually had case notes on paper? Yes. He did all his reports longhand. He didn't like computers. He was suspicious of them. And his wife has said he often brought his case notes home to work on there, which is completely against our protocols. Well, I just have the Swedish file, just our notes, that's all. Here. These are the same killers. They are the same injuries. They are gang captains. Radnieciba. Thanks. This is great, Colonel. Thanks. So, Sergeant Zids can take you to the hotel. We'll call you. OK. They were the Major's superiors? Yeah. Putnis is an asshole. He has rules. You can't tell jokes about s*x or black people. And Murnieks? Murnieks is my boss. Ethnic Russian. Pretty much the only ex-KGB left. Different kind of asshole. You heard of the Radnieciba gang? No, Colonel. Thank you. Yeah, Stefan, could you chase down some faxes that went from us to Latvia on on Friday afternoon, around three... three-thirty? What I'm after is the names and addresses of the recipients. Can we trace that just from the fax numbers? Yeah, if I go through Europol. It always takes at least a day. I've just been to visit Ann-Britt. She looks much better. And... how we doing on the... men who took the drugs out of the raft? Looking through boatyards. Around Lomma. OK. Soon as you can with the faxes, yeah? Thanks. Mr. Eckers? Me? No, not me. Sorry. Who are you? Kurt. German? Swedish. Married, Kurt? No, but I've got a daughter about your age. Do you have anything planned for tonight? It never gets dark here... this time of year. I wouldn't want to deprive Mr. Eckers. Thank you. They're making an arrest. Right. This way? Yes, Colonel. Sorry for the early start this morning. You sleep OK? Fine, yeah. We can go in. Are they the same gang? Yes. Do you think they killed Kalns and Leja? If they didn't, then they certainly know who did. You think they killed the Major too? Torturers have signatures. These people aren't children. No, but that child was a child - the one that was crying its eyes out. How do you do it in Sweden? You wake them up with a cup of coffee and a piece of cake? This is salted cabbage juice. It's extremely good if you've had a drink too many. Did they have the Major's case notes, the men at the flat? No. Was one of those guns the weapon that killed him? Karlis was shot with a handgun, not an assault rifle. It's ongoing, Kurt. We're rounding up every member of the gang we can find. So what about the fax? I'm still waiting to hear about that. I want to interrogate Karlis' wife again. We've spoken to her before. She's holding something back. Like what? I think she knows where the papers are. We should go and see her. Come with me. You might think of something that I had forgotten. Let's go. I asked her if there was anywhere where the case notes might be that she might have forgotten. And I said that there isn't. I think the Colonel might have some other questions for you. I'm not a Colonel. I didn't know he'd gone to Sweden. He came home. We talked. He said nothing about his work or what happened there. I was going to bed when he had a call. He told me he had to go to the station. I didn't see any of his papers. Fine. I understand. The last I heard of my husband was him calling through the bathroom door, "See you later." That was the last thing! Good. Thank you, we'll talk again. Yeah? So, there are three fax numbers. The first two are Latvian police. Two Colonels, Putnis and Murnieks. And the last fax went to a man called Upitis. He's a journalist. Right. Thanks, Stefan. I'll speak to you soon. Colonel. You need a ride to the hotel? No, I need some fresh air, so I'm going to walk, thanks. Excuse me, do you remember the woman I was speaking to last night? Grey, silk dress... No, sorry, sorry. ..butterflies on it. She was a well-presented, attractive woman. 
 
 Mr. Eckers? We need to be quick. My name is Inese. You haven't got long, OK? Get in the car, please. I thought I was coming to meet with Baiba Liepa. She's being watched. Get in the car. Listen. I'd just like to see her, OK? My name's Sergei Upitis. Please. The journalist? Yeah. The Major sent you a fax the day before he died. Look, I write about political corruption, OK, between gangs, police, politicians. Karlis used to talk to me, he gave me information. Then he broke off. Last week, I got this fax with two dead bodies and a life raft in Sweden, and then two days after, Baiba calls me to say he's dead. Why was I sent that fax? You tell me. He thought somebody high up in his department might be involved with Radnieciba gang. Did you see his case notes? Do you know where they are? People are asking me a lot of questions, and people are lying to me, so I'll talk to the Major's wife. No, they've killed three men in the last ten days. They're asking questions because they think you know something, Colonel. They'll be watching you too, listening to your calls. Let's talk. We've got ten more minutes. You get the girl for ten more minutes. Yeah, I'm an old man in a hurry. Inese, Baiba sent me that note. She must want to speak to me. Go to the St Francis Church tomorrow night at eight. I'll see what I can do. Sorry, no I just need one minute with him. Colonel Murnieks, there's a microphone in my alarm clock at the hotel. There's also a man in a grey suit who's been watching me the last two nights. I will not accept this. You think this is us? It's against the law. Why in hell would I spy on you? What's the problem? My hotel room's being bugged. It's funny, is it? You two got the faxes. I checked. So, what's happening with the two men you arrested? And I would appreciate the truth. What's going on? The inquiry's continuing, Colonel. Tell me your room number, I'll retrieve the microphone, give it to the forensics department. The gangs have that kind of talent, to spy. A lot of ex-KGB went into the gangs. I stayed in law enforcement. Colonel! Hi. Hello. I think we should keep walking. Somebody thinks one of us knows something. All I know is that Karlis and me, we'd stopped talking about anything important, not for a long time. Do you know what he was doing? No, not really. Do you have any theory? I know he sent a fax to three people when he was in Sweden. That's about the only piece of information I can keep track of. And I think that he... he sent it deliberately to... to provoke something, to nudge someone into showing himself. Murnieks and Putnis both say they didn't get any fax, but somebody in the police department definitely did, and someone called Sergei Upitis. No, Sergei's a friend of us both. Putnis and Murnieks have interrogated me, over and over. They wanted to know where Karlis' notes are. Why? I... If you think that he would have hidden his notes, I can help you try and find them. Come back with me, then, but we'd better go separately. ATTIC? We can talk here. It's this one. Skol? Skol. He said you were good at your job. Sometimes I am not very good at anything else. Why is he dead? Why does that mean I'm being followed? Why did he keep secrets? He was probably just trying to protect you. He stopped speaking to me. I don't know if he was... with a woman, if he was with criminals! You think he gave me so much grief, just to protect me? It's bred in us, I'm afraid - policemen. Skol. Wallander. 'This is Colonel Putnis. Where are you?' I'm just walking. We have the man who killed Karlis. It's a journalist. He tricked the Major out of his apartment. He tortured and shot him. His name is Upitis. Kurt? They've just arrested Upitis. For what? Killing Karlis. He didn't do it. He didn't. The gun was hidden behind the toilet in his house. The Major's blood was in his car. It's the gun that killed the Major. And it is the phone that he used to call the Major out of the house. So how did you get to him? His name came up in an interrogation. Of who? The men you arrested at that flat? Some of their associates. It's been a long night. But we've done well. Let's go for a drink. Come on. He was a journalist. He wasn't a gang member. With links to the gangs. Contacts. We've been suspicious of him before now. Yeah, but now he starts torturing people, starts killing people? He was having an affair with Liepa's wife. So did he have the Major's case notes? I mean, that's what everyone's after, isn't it? It's no longer relevant. We have the man who killed him. This case is closed. You left a suspect in there with his belt! Colonel. I'm not a Colonel! We don't have Colonels. Upitis is dead. They say that he shot Karlis. They say that he killed himself. They've closed the case. Would he kill himself? No. Do you think there's... any possibility he killed Karlis? No. He was your lover. Yes, at one time. Yeah, and you should have told me. Why is it your business? Is it any of your business at all? Well, I... They're not going to be looking for any papers now. They closed the case. If I... Don't tell me my lover is dead and then interrogate me about it! You don't know any... I'm sorry. I can't... Look, I could stay here. No. You can go. I want you to leave. We both know there's something. They're lying. It's over. Thank you so very much. I don't need your help. You have one new message. Kurt. This is Stefan. You've had a call from a girl called Inese in Riga. She says it's important, can you call her back? I've texted you her number. Come on. Go on, then, in you go. Go on! Go on! Go on! Hello. Inese? It's Kurt. I've founds Karlis's case notes. Baiba's gone missing. Has...has she been arrested? I can't find out. Her flat's been searched. Kurt, please, Yes, I will. I can't believe this is happening. I didn't grow up with this kind of thing, not like Baiba. This isn't part of my life. How do you know her? She's my cousin. She used to look after me when I was little. The family didn't like it that she married a policeman. I liked Karlis. Do you think she's dead? No and I'm going to make sure whoever wants this gets it. Stop this madness. Excuse me. My old room, please. 207. Yeah, passport. Good. Thank you. This is Kurt Wallander. I have Major Liepa's case notes. Yeah, Wallander. We'll pick you up in the hotel lobby. Bring the file. Not until I've seen Baiba Liepa, not till I've seen she's OK. 20 minutes. Who's there? Baiba! Kurt? Are you OK? Oh, God, Kurt! You're OK? I'm OK. I got the case notes. Why didn't you go back? I wanted you to leave. I went. I found the case notes at home. Karlis left them for me. He left them on purpose in case something happened. You're an idiot, Kurt. You'd been safe... Where is it? We both walk out safe, then you can have your file. Where are Liepa's papers? Look, I don't know. I don't know. Listen, I didn't come here knowing anything. They're with someone else. They know where they are. No! Look, we go to Latdale Market. They'll call my phone at four o'clock, they'll give you more details. Anyone else answers it, those papers will go straight to the press, to Europol, to the President's office. No! Leave her! Get them out! Get them out! Where is it? They call my phone. You let us go, I hand you the phone, and they tell you exactly where Liepa's papers are. Then I have no guarantee. You stay here. Both of you. You can go if you like. She stays here. Look, who are you working for? Please. Answer your phone. Yeah? 'It's Inese,  I left it on the old camera stall. Yeah. Third aisle on the left. OK. Next to the one that sells locks and old phones. OK. Where is it? OK. It's there, it's there. There! This? Yeah. What the hell is this? You can send this out to millions of people. I can't. I don't know how to do it. There are copies! He didn't have a computer! Whoever left this here has read it! No. Nobody knows what's on there. Where's the original?! I... I... Get down, get down, get down. Down, Baiba, down! Baiba. Go, go, go! Careful. Go right! Go right! Let's try the Swedish Embassy, we'll be safe there. Oh, quick, here, here. Murnieks. We need to get out of Riga. We should talk. I don't know how big this is. I don't know if it was just Zids and the gang, or... Who was it that your husband trusted, out of the Colonels? Murnieks. Well, whoever called him the night that he died, and got him out of the house without making him suspicious, he must have trusted the voice. Did you have anywhere else you used to go? You and Karlis? Somewhere special? My father's house in Ventspils. Then we just had our flat. Otherwise, I was at the music academy, he was at the police headquarters. Could he have hidden it inside police HQ? Yes. Really? He would do that. He would find it funny. Make him laugh. Hide it in plain sight. He said that. That was pretty much the last thing he said to me. Where would you hide it there in plain sight? Where would you hide case notes? The archive. There is an archive in the basement. It goes back to the KGB days. He used to say it was a record of every atrocity committed in Latvia. He used to tease me there was a file... about me. About you? I was in the freedom movement before the revolution. I was arrested a few times. If we ever used to have an argument, he would say, "It's all going in the file." It's there. It's in my file. We have to go back. This thing isn't going to end until someone gets hold of those papers. You're not going to be safe. We need to go back. I'm sorry. He said that you'd seen what that stuff did. Zids said that you had seen what the acid did to whom? To Karlis? It's him. Leo. Leo. Baiba. We have to get into police headquarters. Well, go. No, it's the archive. Karlis left some papers there. Leo, please! Him? Yes. OK. Thank you. I'll come back here in an hour. What if you don't? Call Putnis. Sir, you are under arrest. Karlis was my best friend. Do you know who killed him? I think so. Someone here? Maybe. I'll take you through the drunk tank. The archive is two levels down in the basement. How's it organised? It's OK, it's OK. Every row is a letter. Six sections - crimes, suspects, politicals, and some others. It's in Russian. You need to get through the door at the end of the corridor. You won't have long. I need you to write Baiba Liepa. Thank you. I should have looked out for my friend better. Kurt. I've got it. I got it. I called Putnis. Kurt. I must say, you're a very difficult person to protect. I wish you'd talked to me before. Are those the Major's papers? Yes. It would have been a lot easier if you'd trusted me. Murnieks? And Sergeant Zids. I never got the fax the Major sent. They made sure. Then they put Upitis out of the way, then there would have only been you, her, and me, in time. Where are they? Well, Zids is in hospital. I think when I have the Major's papers, I... It's enough to arrest Murnieks. It is the original? Yeah. What do you mean the original? You mean, rather than a copy on a digital camera? I didn't tell you about that. Don't! Don't! Baiba! Baiba. Baiba. I was born in Riga, my parents were Russian. But I served Latvia my whole life. Since freedom, I can't vote. I get an alien's passport. That's how they treat the Russians in Latvia. What did the case notes say? Someone in my department was in charge with Radnieciba, organising drugs, probably Zids. But as Major Liepa goes along, he seems to find it harder and harder to believe there's not someone higher up. Putnis... did receive the fax. He and Zids put Upitis in suspicion, and killed him. I couldn't have moved on either of them... without evidence. How long were you following us? Some time. His suit fits you well. Yeah. Karlis was so nice when he came back from you. It was like I had him home again. I don't know which... Thanks. Here. Thank you. Why don't you come to Sweden sometime? Is it as nice as it looks in the book? Yeah, it can be, midsummer. I'm not going to be coming back, am I? I mean, I mean, I could come back, if... I mean, today's been nice. Yeah. We've been to a cemetery. When is your flight? It's tomorrow.
