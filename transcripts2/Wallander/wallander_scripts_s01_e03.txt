 Svedberg : AR3324. 
 No. 
 GF3O01. 
 No. 
 (Yawns) 
 BN6133. 
 God, I hate chasing car smugglers. 
 I mean, who cares? 
 I mean, who actually gives a toss? 
 You should wear a hat, you know. You're catching the sun. 
 I'm knackered. 
 We're not going to get anywhere now. 
 We should have a drink. 
 Should we? 
 (Seagulls crying) 
 How was your holiday? 
 OK. 
 Do anything exciting? 
 Things are happening. 
 What kind of things? 
 Personal, I think. 
 Things are starting to intrude... 
 I don't know. On work...police work. 
 Don't tell me you've been smuggling cars. 
 Sometimes one can blow the other apart, though, can't it? 
 You know, feelings, work. 
 I can't let you have any more time off. 
 Is this personal stuff? I mean, we're pushed as it is. 
 I don't need time off. 
 God, that's me. I'm sorry, I am done for. 
 I think...I think I'll stay here for a bit. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 You all right? 
 It's all right. 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 (Tyres screech) 
 Must have fallen asleep at the wheel. I've never done that. 
 Maybe you need a holiday. 
 How was your weekend? Weren't you going off somewhere? 
 Oh, you know - families. 
 Nothing on the ship owners, then? 
 Woman : I keep coming in to find out what's going on, but no-one tells me anything. 
 I assure you, we are doing everything we can, but you must be patient. 
 You can't keep fobbing me off. 
 No-one is fobbing you off, Mrs Hillstrom. 
 There really is nothing to worry about. 
 Trust me, please. 
 That's all I can do - trust you. 
 As soon as there are any developments, I assure you, you will be the first person... 
 So, she last saw her daughter and these others on Midsummer's Eve? 
 They all went on a picnic together, it seems. 
 She got the first of these cards a couple of days later from Hamburg from her daughter, saying they suddenly decided to take off round Europe on a whim. 
 They'd done it before, apparently. 
 Mm. 
 Then a couple of weeks later, a card from Paris, and then a third from Vienna. 
 So what's her problem? 
 This is her daughter's handwriting, presumably. 
 Well, yes. She says it looks like it, but then says she's not sure. 
 I think the problem's her. 
 There's not a lot we can do, is there? 
 Give me a shout if she gets on your back again. 
 Hey. Dinner. 
 Ah-ha! 
 Mm-hm. 
 This is lovely. 
 Laughs : Dad, you hate it. your disgusting diet. 
 It's not that bad. 
 That's why you're always so tired - crap food. 
 I'm not always so tired, I'm busy. So what is this? 
 Adzuki bean sprout salad. It's full of protein. 
 Eat it. 
 No. Early start. 
 Give Mum my love, won't you? 
 Are you staying with them? 
 No, I'm sleeping on a park bench round the corner. 
 Course I'm staying with them. 
 Mum's...happy now. 
 I think we all just have to be a bit adult about it. 
 Cool. 
 Keep in touch, won't you? 
 Dad, it's just a few days. See you when I get back, OK? 
 See you. 
 "Eat me or die." 
 (Nature documentary on tv) 
 Hmm. Maybe. 
 But you're not saying Linda wrote the postcards. 
 No, no, no. All I'm saying, I think, is it's a common sort of handwriting, isn't it, for kids of that age. 
 Easy to forge. 
 Svedberg's usually in by now, isn't he? 
 Give him a call, and I suppose we should talk to the other parents. 
 Just double-check. 
 She is such a neurotic mother, Eva Hillstrom, always fussing and worrying. 
 They've all been off like this before, then? 
 Sure, they're friends, they're young. 
 They always do something crazy Midsummer holiday. Doesn't everyone? 
 From your daughter? 
 You're joking. 
 It's hard enough getting Lena to speak to us, never mind cards. 
 So you're not worried? 
 I wasn't until you started asking questions again. 
 I thought we'd sorted this with the other guy. 
 What other guy? 
 Kalle Svedberg. Yeah, that was his name. 
 When was this? 
 Last week sometime. 
 What else did the other detective ask you? 
 He wanted to know what my son and his friends were doing on Midsummer, where they were, whether we knew their plans. 
 What's going on? 
 Nothing. This is just routine. 
 I keep getting his answer machine. for this morning. 
 There's no mention of any meeting with Eva Hillstrom or...or any of the other parents. 
 Martinsson : We should have brought the ram. 
 In case we have to smash the door in. 
 I've never been here before. Have you? 
 No. 
 Sighs : We've got to get in. 
 I could kick it. Do you want me to kick it? 
 Kalle? 
 Kalle? 
 Hello? 
 Jesus! 
 Tell them to put all units on red alert. 
 Go on. 
 (Radio chattering) 
 Bed's made. 
 I think he's been... lying in there all night. 
 It's a pistol shot. Three metres, maybe. 
 Time? 
 I think you're right. Yesterday. 
 Place is covered in prints. Nothing much else to go on. 
 No sign of a break-in. Nothing disturbed. 
 Paisley sheets. 
 Is that significant? 
 It just makes me incredibly sad. I don't know why. 
 I just thought maybe we owed it to Svedberg, Kalle, to take a few moments. 
 One of our own. One of the family. 
 Yes? 
 (Policeman speaks indistinctly) 
 We've found a next of kin, a cousin - Ylva Brink. 
 She's a midwife at the hospital. 
 Kalle was... He was a really... He was a good colleague. 
 It must be very difficult for you. 
 Kalle always said you were his best friend. 
 Did he? 
 Was this something to do with a case? 
 We're not sure yet. 
 I know this is so difficult, but when did you... when did you last hear from Kalle? 
 He called me last Sunday. 
 And how did he seem then? 
 Tired. 
 Overworked, he said. 
 Overworked? He'd just been on leave, hadn't he? 
 He seemed very stressed. 
 When would you say that this started, this stress? 
 Round about the time he took his holiday. 
 Just after Midsummer's Eve, I'd say. 
 Are you ready? 
 I'm coming. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Uh...was there anyone in Kalle's life? 
 A woman, you mean? No. Not that I know of. 
 He's more likely to have talked to you about that kind of thing. 
 Who else might he have talked to, other friends? 
 There's another cousin, on his father's side. 
 A professor at the university in Copenhagen. 
 Sture Bjorkland. 
 He has a house outside Hedeskoga somewhere. 
 And they spoke? 
 Yeah. He mentioned him, yes. 
 You were the one. 
 Thanks. 
 (Footsteps approach) 
 Thought you'd gone home. 
 How are we doing? 
 Not much luck with the neighbours. 
 No-one seems to have heard any noise - no shot. 
 Svedberg doesn't seem to have done much entertaining. Kept himself to himself. 
 Who's your best friend? 
 My best friend? 
 What, my bestest bestest? 
 I...used to think my husband. not so sure any more. 
 Why? 
 I had a drink with Svedberg, with Kalle, day before yesterday. 
 We had a drink. 
 You should go home, Kurt. 
 We can't do any more for him tonight. 
 Good night. 
 Policeman : Sir? 
 Sir? 
 What time is it? 
 It's just gone 4.00. I thought I should... 
 Sure. Yeah. Thanks. 
 Shall I get you a car? 
 No, no, I'll be OK. Thanks. 
 It's OK, fine. 
 Hoglund : Who is she? 
 Wallander : I've no idea. 
 Ylva Brink didn't think that he had a woman. 
 But there's more - I found this in Svedberg's house. 
 Astrid Hillstrom, the one with the hysterical mother, that's her. 
 I'm guessing the missing kids are in this picture. 
 (Woman shouts) 
 I called the mother. 
 Why does no-one tell me anything? 
 Get Mrs Hillstrom a cup of coffee. 
 Stop patronising me. I want my daughter. 
 Please have a seat, Mrs Hillstrom. 
 Thank you for coming in. 
 Take a look at that, please. 
 You've seen this before? 
 Yes, I've got the original here. 
 The other detective made a copy. 
 When was it taken? 
 It was last year, Martin's birthday. I've told all this to the other man. 
 Are the other kids in it? 
 Yes. 
 Martin, Lena, my daughter Astrid. 
 Wallander : Why are they dressed up like that? 
 They have these secret parties. I've been through all of this. 
 Who's the fourth, the other girl? 
 That's Isa Edengren. 
 She was meant to be with them at Midsummer, but she was ill. 
 Have you spoken to her? 
 Yeah. 
 Has she had cards from them? 
 I don't think so. 
 Doesn't she think it's strange not to have heard from them? 
 Why are you asking me? Of course it's strange. 
 That's what I keep saying. No-one listens. 
 Not even the other detective. He knew something was wrong, though. 
 Do you know this woman? 
 No. Who is she? 
 Something's happened, hasn't it? You know something. 
 Where are they? Where's my child? 
 (She sobs) 
 Did you ever know Svedberg to tell a lie? 
 No, I always thought you got what you saw. 
 There's still no answer from the girl's home. 
 Want me to get down there? 
 I'll try Svedberg's other cousin. I'll check the girl's place out. 
 Are we declaring the kids missing? 
 Not yet. 
 Not yet. 
 Are you Wallander? 
 Detective Inspector... 
 You think this is a fitting way to find out about your cousin's death? 
 No, it's not. I'm sorry. We didn't find out about you until late last night. 
 What do you want? 
 I need to ask you a few questions about Kalle. 
 Men of our age must beware the lactic acid build-up, as I'm sure you're aware. 
 Look, I have to be in Copenhagen in a couple of hours. 
 Of course. 
 Just tell me when you last saw Kalle. 
 A few weeks ago. 
 I was going to Scotland to stay with friends. 
 Kalle was going to house-sit, like always. 
 That's really the only time we saw each other. 
 He lived in your house? 
 Whenever I was away. 
 The arrangement suited us both. 
 How long had he been doing this? 
 For about the last ten years. 
 Did you get the feeling at that time that he was stressed? 
 Stressed? 
 He was as stressed as anyone who'd recently split up with a woman. 
 You didn't know that either? 
 No. 
 You don't seem to know much about Kalle. 
 How long had you worked with him? 
 I don't... 
 You're a policeman. 
 Sure, that's my job. 
 If you just answer my questions, I'll get on with it. 
 They stayed here while I was away. He'd done it with others. 
 I think he liked impressing them with the place. 
 Like a break for them. A holiday. Completely private, you see. 
 The only visitor here is the postman, and that's the way I like it. 
 Did you meet her, the latest? 
 I never met any of them. 
 She was called Louise, I know that. 
 He let it slip when we were talking. 
 Louise. 
 Did you... Do you recognise this woman? 
 No. Is that all? 
 I couldn't get a glass of water, could I? 
 Kalle spoke of you often, Inspector Wallander. 
 He always said you're a man he could trust his life to. 
 Wallander : Have we got hold of this other girl? 
 Woman : 'Isa? Not yet.' 
 I'll take a look. 
 'I can send Martinsson.' 
 I said I'll take a look. 
 Where does she live? 
 Isa? 
 Whispers : Isa? 
 Man : Let's get her in. 
 I think she'll be OK. I'll keep you posted. 
 Excuse me, you... Do you have any... 
 You don't have any, um, change for the machine, do you? 
 I'm going to be dead in three weeks' time. 
 What do I need money for? 
 Wallander : 'Diabetic?' 
 I can't believe this. I've got diabetes? 
 Doctor : Well, it's not full-blown. Type 2. 
 Look after yourself better, you should be fine. 
 Talk to your doctor, though, as soon as you can. 
 What about the fainting? 
 Easy now. 
 I'm all right. 
 People with type 2 often develop a condition called hyperosmotic non-ketotic acidosis. 
 HONK. 
 HONK? 
 Yeah, HONK. 
 It's caused by your blood sugar rising to very high levels. 
 HONK? 
 Yeah. This should give you a clearer picture. 
 And there's dietary information in there as well. 
 HONK. 
 Hello, I'm Kurt. I'm a policeman. 
 Do you mind if I, um... 
 Just a few minutes. 
 I'm the one who found you. 
 How are you feeling? 
 It was close, you know. 
 We had a bit of a ride to get you here. 
 Look...I'm sure you must be feeling angry or stupid or miserable or relieved, or all of these things at once, or... 
 You've been watching too much daytime TV. 
 Look, some people hate jam, some people hate football. 
 I hate being alive. It's not such a big deal. 
 Well, it is for your parents. 
 You reckon? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Look, I'm sorry, I need to ask you some questions. 
 That's why I was at your house. 
 I've already answered all this. 
 When? 
 The other guy, Svedberg. 
 You spoke to him. What did he want? 
 Same as you, I expect. 
 Why did we party? Why did we dress up? 
 Who was there? Who else knew where we'd be? 
 Why wasn't I with the others? 
 I know he's dead. Shot, wasn't he? 
 Yeah. 
 Was he your friend? 
 Yeah, he was. 
 What about your friends? 
 You think they've gone off, just like the cards say? 
 Yes. 
 So you're not worried about them? 
 Why should I be? 
 I'm actually quite pissed off with them. 
 They took off without telling me just cos I was sick, right? 
 So then I had to go to my parents in France cos I didn't have any excuse not to. 
 And then they really pissed me off and I came back to that... horrible house. 
 Oh, God, just go away, will you? 
 Leave me alone! 
 Nurse : There you go. 
 There's something about Svedberg and these kids, something personal. 
 He spoke to me, right? We had a drink that evening. 
 I think he was trying to tell me something. 
 I... 
 I keep getting this feeling that he is still trying to tell me something. 
 I think he's trying to talk to me. 
 I know it sounds stupid, but he meant me to find this, cos he knew I would. 
 He trusted I would work it out if something happened. 
 Why would he bother? 
 I think he knew he was in danger. I think he knew it. 
 Might be his girlfriend. They might have split up. 
 Should we release the picture? 
 I've got to do something. 
 Svedberg meant us to find that picture. 
 Right. 
 (Mobile phone rings) 
 Yeah? 
 It's them. No question. 
 They've been buried here for weeks. 
 (Crying) 
 We didn't want you to read about it in the papers. 
 I'm so sorry, but we have to ask you some more questions, Isa. 
 Have you any idea who might have done this? 
 Did anybody else know about the party that night? 
 No. 
 So why was it so secret, hmm? 
 Was there any kind of game that you played? 
 Anything that could have ended up... 
 No! 
 What about the other detective? 
 The one you saw before. 
 I think... 
 Was there anything else that he asked you? Was there anything about him? 
 I was meant to be there. 
 It can't have been Svedberg. 
 If he'd... If he'd killed them, why go around asking exactly the same questions we've been asking? 
 But he knew something was wrong. 
 Something that made him suspicious about those kids. 
 That he kept to himself. 
 I mean, it looks like there was something in all this that he didn't want to come out. 
 Something in his own life. 
 What exactly did we know about him, outside of work? 
 Martinsson : He used to say something. 
 When we were working on that dope-smuggling racket a couple of summers back, he said you should always stop every now and then and look behind you, back over your shoulder, like the Indians. 
 Indians? 
 American Indians. He was quite into them. 
 Hoglund : He was into Indians? 
 Had books on them, apparently. 
 And what would we see? 
 I'm sorry, when? 
 If we looked over our shoulders like the bloody Indians. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Someone who shouldn't be there. 
 Christ, what does that mean? 
 I don't know, I'm just telling you what he said. 
 Hoglund : Ystad Police. 
 When? 
 OK, thanks. 
 That was the hospital. 
 Isa Edengren has disappeared from her room. 
 OK. 
 We gave her a sleeping pill after you'd gone and then left her for the night. 
 She must have got out down the fire escape. 
 Yeah, if she left on her own. 
 Want to put out a description? 
 Yeah, urgent. 
 She can't have gone far. 
 We should have had her guarded. 
 Keep looking over your shoulder. We need to find her, quickly. 
 We may not be the only ones looking for her now. 
 (Men groan) 
 Police! 
 Neighbour! 
 Kurt Wallander. 
 Erik Lundberg. 
 I keep an eye on this place. 
 The parents are still in France? 
 France? Spain? Who knows? They own property all over. 
 And Isa lives in that gazebo while they're away? 
 Yeah, they don't let her into the main house. 
 Why? 
 There's been parties in the past. Things got broken, stolen. 
 That's Barnso Island. They've got a house up there. 
 She's going to be all right, isn't she? 
 They're a suicidal family. 
 Isa tried before, and that's how her brother died. 
 It was the same policeman that dealt with the boy. 
 Which policeman? 
 The one that was killed. 
 Oh, he came here, Svedberg. 
 What did he want? 
 Just to ask about the parties - who used to come, were they fancy dress, that kind of thing. 
 And when was this? 
 Just after Midsummer. 
 Thanks for showing me round. 
 We could give the guys at Norrkoping a call, see about this Barnso house. 
 Svedberg will lead us to her. We've just got to listen. 
 You do the files and the papers. I'll do the personal stuff. 
 We've already done this. 
 Then we'll do it again, but better. 
 Go home if you want. This is between me and Svedberg. 
 No, this is between all of us and Svedberg. 
 Maybe we've caught up with him. 
 No, no, no, we haven't. There has to be more. 
 Fyrudden - it's the harbour town for Barnso Island. 
 You can't go up there now, Kurt, it's a four-hour drive. 
 She could be anywhere. 
 I'm gonna find her. 
 Kurt, this is... 
 Svedberg thought he could count on me. 
 I didn't realise, didn't listen. I'm not gonna make that mistake again. 
 This is not your fault. 
 
 
 
 Reporter : 'The three teenagers were celebrating Midsummer Eve in the nature reserve. Police aren't commenting on any possible connection between the murder  of the teenagers and Kalle Svedberg three days ago. However, they have released a picture of a woman they would like to hear from in relation to that murder.' 
 Can I help you? 
 Wallander. 
 I haven't seen her for weeks. 
 She could have gone out with one of the tourist boats earlier. 
 She doesn't always go across with me. 
 Are you coming or not? 
 Is she OK - Isa? 
 Why wouldn't she be? 
 The kids in the nature reserve - that was her lot. 
 I knew them. They came out here often. 
 Can't believe somebody could do things like that. 
 Anybody else ever come? 
 Only when their parents were away. 
 Hey! 
 That's you, over there. 
 (Rustling) 
 Isa? 
 Isa, I know you're here. 
 How did you know? 
 You told me. 
 The bag. It moved. 
 Policemen notice these things. 
 You haven't got anything to eat, have you? 
 This food is really good. 
 My daughter's been trying to get me to eat a bit better lately. 
 So are you gonna show me around? 
 OK. 
 Your daughter's really sorted, isn't she? 
 She's Linda Wallander - I was at the same school. 
 I didn't know that. 
 Why would you? She was four years above me. 
 We all thought she was really cool. 
 I just always felt so small against someone like her. 
 Like, totally insignificant. 
 She did what you did once. 
 Pills. 
 Saved them up. 
 I found her too, just in time. 
 Why? 
 God. 
 Why would she? 
 Were you a crap dad? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I was a crap dad. 
 Totally crap dad. 
 Apparently, I'm diabetic. How sad is that, eh? 
 I've got hyper-gosmotic non-kototic something or other. 
 HONK. 
 HONK? 
 You've got something called HONK? 
 It's actually quite serious. 
 (She giggles) 
 Yeah, it's not funny. 
 HONK? 
 Yeah, all right. 
 OK, that's enough. 
 Oh! Keep away, weird person with HONK. 
 What's happening? 
 Hoglund : 'A few calls on the Louise picture. We're following up. Nothing like we'd hoped for. Nyberg says the bullets were definitely fired through a silencer. The press are all over us, Kurt. The kids' killing's everywhere. Lisa's getting panicky. She wants reinforcements. Are you bringing Isa back? We need you here.' 
 If Isa's got anything for us, I'm only gonna get it here. 
 You'll have to hold the fort. 
 'Kurt!' 
 I'm staying with Isa. 
 Isa : We were apart. 
 Outside from anyone else. 
 That was the idea. 
 Everyone's so obsessed with being cool. 
 We wanted to be uncool. The uncoolest. 
 They all thought we were nerdy, great - that's what we wanted. 
 But nobody knew where you had these parties? 
 I've already told you. 
 OK, OK. 
 So how did you organise them? Was it text or e-mail? 
 God, no. That's far too cool. 
 I mean, excuse me, but how uncool is that? 
 We sent them to each other. In the post. 
 I mean, imagine. 
 Well, it's lovely. 
 Which just goes to show how uncool you are. 
 I thought that was good. 
 No. It's good when I'm uncool. 
 With you...it's tragic. 
 (He laughs) 
 Did the other detective know about these? 
 I don't know. No, I don't think so. 
 Svedberg was funny, wasn't he? 
 Why? 
 I suppose you don't often meet a gay policeman. 
 Gay? 
 But he wasn't gay. 
 He... According to his cousin, he'd just split up with a woman. 
 The one in the picture? 
 What picture? 
 He showed me a picture he had in his wallet. 
 Er... 
 Was it her? 
 Yeah, I think it was. 
 What did he want to know? 
 If I knew her. 
 And do you? Did he say why he wanted to know? 
 He just showed me, that's all. 
 Enough, please. 
 I'm tired. 
 Hoglund : 'So Svedberg spoke to Isa.' 
 He showed Isa the Louise picture. Wanted to know if she knew her. 
 This woman is looming larger and larger. How many people... 
 (Isa screams) 
 Wallander! 
 Isa? 
 Isa! 
 Isa! Isa. 
 (Motorboat engine revs) 
 (He groans) 
 (He yells) Can I have some water, please, and a Coke? No, not a Coke. And some food. Um... Omelettes. I'll be, er, round the back there. I thought policemen were supposed to be getting younger. How did you know I was a policeman? I was married to one. I can smell them. And I saw your ID when you paid. Where is he now? Your husband. We finished. Years ago. You? I don't know why I still wear it. Hope. You live next to people. In their lives. What do we...know about each other? Any of us? I'm Anna. Kurt. You should rest. There's a room in the back. You can use it, if you want. ♪ Oh, whisper me words ♪ 
♪ In the shape of a bay ♪ 
♪ Shelter my love ♪ 
♪ From the wind and the rain... ♪ I just heard on the radio about the girl on the island... and about the policeman who found her. So why didn't he kill me? Maybe he didn't realise you were there. I led him there. You didn't lead him there. The guys from Norrkoping said the boat he stole was missing before you arrived. You can't blame yourself. He was after Isa, same as you. Looks like we've got a positive ID on Louise - Copenhagen. Copenhagen? Yeah. I released the picture to the Danish press. I thought that's what you'd want. We have a couple of sightings that match up. The first one is a guy who thinks he's seen her at a bar near Central Station. Second one's a cab driver. Please, God. Give us a break. Man : No, won't be long now. Wallander? They've got it surrounded. She's been in there about half an hour. (Dance music plays) Louise. Yeah? Kurt Wallander. Ystad Police. Can I get you a drink? Sure. Another one of those and a glass of water, please. I just need to use the ladies'. Woman : Hey, that's the ladies'. Medium height, blonde, trouser suit. Look, she couldn't have got far. "He", not "she". That's how he got out. Louise is a man. Wiped the make-up off in the toilet, lost the wig, fixed the clothes, walked out as a man. Then surely you must have glimpsed him coming out of the toilet? I mean, if you were watching... Svedberg was shagging a trannie. Wow. Photographer : Lovely. Fantastic. Thank you. And now turn around. Yep, that's it. Hold it there. Fabulous. (Phone rings) OK, I'll get it. Ystad Police. Martinsson. What? Nyberg : 9mm with a silencer. It's him. No question. Hoglund : No-one seems to have seen anything. Well, it wasn't an accident, was it? What? Three shots at close range? No, him being here, when the couple were here - he knew. He knows we're onto him, after the club. He can't stop himself. It's as if the closer we get, the more he wants to goad us. Or goad you? Yeah, that'd be great. 'All right, then.' OK. All right, we'll be in touch. Thank you. What do we know about the photographer? His name's Rolf Haag. He's got a studio up in Surbrunnen. We have to know if he told anyone else where this would be happening. Come on, we need to move! Yep, OK, I'm on to it. (Engine starts) Wallander : These are the only pictures that were taken. Hoglund : Married for two hours. Nobody I spoke to knew where they were going for these pictures. It's just a little present to themselves. It was a... some sort of private place that they wanted marked on their wedding day. Somewhere special. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some... Somewhere secret. I've got his assistant. Whose? The photographer's! Right, OK. Good, let's get her in ASAP. You're telling us you really didn't know the location of these pictures? No. They said they'd tell Rolf when they sent the payment. By post? I saw the cheque. And Rolf was the only other person who knew this location? They said they wanted their private moment. Rolf said they were really insistent. They wanted it kept secret. He's someone who gets inside other people's lives, without them knowing. Gets behind their mask, gets behind their secrets. This whole thing's a mess of secrets. This dressing-up and costumes. The couple on the beach, the kids in the wood, and Louise. Biggest secret of the lot. How much does Svedberg know? Well, I think this is all because of Svedberg. He's in love with this guy, transvestite, Louise. He's ashamed. He wants to end the relationship. Louise hates him for it, wants revenge. Martinsson : So he executes seven innocent people? He's a psychopath. We know that. OK, we know his secret now. How did he know theirs? No-one knew where they would be. Except them. Except them. What's his next move? Well, he's not running away, is he? That's for sure. It's almost as if he... wants to reveal himself now, but he needs to choose how and when. Holgersson : And who. There's still one question, isn't there? Why didn't he kill you? Postmen. Get down to the photographer's studio. I want the wedding couple's letter, and I want the envelope it came in. How am I supposed to get...? I don't care if you stick your nose into every bin in Skane to get them. Postmen? Invisible job. No-one takes any notice of the postman. They assume he's just the postman. He can go where he wants. Eight? You only have eight postmen working for you? No, but you're talking about out of town. Skarby, Surbrunnen... Country postmen? Yeah. These eight, I need their names. Do you have pictures of them? Uh, yes. We have a user-friendly information brochure. Feel Safe With The Post. No. Well, what about here? The sorting office? How many people here could've handled this mail? Well, country postmen sort their own stuff area by area. Hi, Dad. Dad, you do actually stink. When did you get back? Couple of hours ago. I...I heard about the girl. Was that you who was with her? I've really missed you. Dad, I've been away three days. I even sent you a card. You haven't been home, have you? She knew you. Who? Isa. Isa, the girl who... She knew you when you were a kid... at school. You didn't know her. She... But she said, you know... She said you were amazing, said they all thought you were amazing. Dad... (He mutters indistinctly) I'm a crap dad - we established that. But I'm just so proud of you. (Sobs) I'm so glad that you're still in the world. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I should... Are you sure you're OK? At least let me get you a clean shirt. You can't go around blubbing and look like some stinking saddo. That is total crap, Dad, yeah? OK? Yeah. Clean shirt. All right. They've just sent this across from the paper. Tomorrow's first edition. Astrid's mother, Eva Hillstrom, accusing you of police negligence. Well, maybe she's right. I've got the prosecutor on my back. He's getting pressure right from the top. They want me to draft in more people. I thought we were close. The postman? I just want to check the rotas again and Martinsson's looking for the couple's letter. This is where we miss Svedberg. We'll have to get reinforcements, then. Bring in relief. If you haven't cracked this, then... Kurt? Get me that Post Office guy. Now. 'Reliefs?' Sure. We've got a couple who do most of the temporary stand-ins. Who are they? One's a woman, Lena Stivell. She was permanent. Went part-time. Had a baby. And the other one? Right. So we need to know where he was working. This is very important. Hang on. He was the relief in Surbrunnen. The photographer's studio. 'I think he did a town one as well. I can find out.' OK, don't do anything, just listen. I'm gonna e-mail a picture to you. It's a bit rough. See if you recognise the person. And you're to get straight back to us. Immediately, do you understand? God, I have waded through some sh1t for this envelope. (Phone rings) Yup? Man : 'Can I speak to Kurt Wallander?' One second. It's for you. Not now. I'm afraid he can't come to the telephone right now. I'm calling from the Post Office. It's quite important. I've got some information for him. He says it's quite important. It's someone from the Post Office. Yes? (Indistinct voice over telephone) Thank you. It's him. (Tyres screech) (Banging, alarm blares) (Alarm trills) He must have been collecting this stuff for years. Other people's lives. Other people's secrets. Kurt? There's a postcard to you here. It's from Linda. My shirt. She's getting my shirt! Jesus Christ! You let her go. You let my daughter go. You want to kill? Kill me. I don't care. But don't you touch my daughter. She's done nothing. So kill me. Please. You're not going to kill me, are you? You could have killed me on the island. Killing's too easy for you, isn't it? You want me to...? You want me to live with this, do you? Why? Why?! Kalle loved you.
