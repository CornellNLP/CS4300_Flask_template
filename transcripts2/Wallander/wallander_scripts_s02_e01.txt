You're meant to curry favour with me! It's nothing too strenuous! Well, yes. Now you get the idea. You can't just keep pretending it's all going to be OK, Dad. Diabetes doesn't have to be serious. If you treat it with respect. This is all fairly straightforward. Well, thanks. It's really good of you. Thank you very much. Actually, I got one of the nurses at the hospital to do it. What?! Don't spoil it! Oh! You are such a... You are such a...pig! Of course. Would you...? Yeah, please. Thanks. (Beeper sounds) I've got to take this. I'm on call. Sure. I should go, actually. I'll get the bill. Dad, come on, tell me. Jamal, Dad. You've met him twice now. You haven't said anything. He's great. He's a good lad. Is that it? You like him - that's all that matters. Yeah, but what about you? He's great. Like I said, he's, um... I mean... Do...his parents live...? I mean, are they over here still or in Syria or...? Of course they live over here. What are you talking about? As long as he makes you happy. What's that meant to mean - "as long as he makes me happy"? What's that supposed to mean? Sweetheart, I like him. I... Well... You know, I suppose he's not what I expected, that's all. Why? Why isn't he what you expected? (Mobile rings) Oh, there's me now. (Everything OK?) Yeah. Right. Right. Um... Yeah. Tell him I'm on my way. I've got to... Er, yeah. Me too. Thanks for this, Jamal. Appreciate it. See you. Bye. Er, that's... Yeah. Thanks. Bye. (Horse neighs) The old couple. The farmer's dead. The paramedics say that she's not going to make it. She had... Someone strung her up. She'd been beaten, she had a gag in her mouth. It's all right, Petters. Just show me. (Fly buzzes) (Laboured breathing) (It's OK. It's OK. I'm a policeman.) He's gonna be all right. He'll be all right. He'll be all right. He'll be all right. Who did this? What's her name? Maria Lovgren. Who did this, Maria? Go on, Maria. F... Who did this? Maria? Maria? Maria! It isn't a hangman's knot. Haven't seen one like it before. A slipknot, though? Yeah, she was hung by the neck. The rope was looped over the hook and tied off. There's got to be more than one of them. Look at it. Any marks on the husband's neck? No, just the wife. She tried to say something before she died. She was saying something... What? I don't know. It was... I don't know. Well, did she say something or didn't she? See what you can do with the knot. You said she tried to speak. Yeah, difficult to say. Tell me about this man who found them. Stefan Nystrom. He and his wife live across the way. Says he heard the horse bolt. Old white stallion. Yeah. I know what it looks like. Heard the horse whinnying and then a big crash. I looked out of the window. I could see it had bolted. I thought Johannes must have heard it. But there was nothing. Then I got suspicious. So I got dressed and came across. And you heard nothing else? Just the horse. Right. Well, thank you. Excuse me. Did they have children? There's a daughter, Hanna. She lives in the town. I'd kill them! If I found them, I'd kill them! There's no reason that you can think of...why... Why someone would do that? Of course there's no reason! There was no money, there was no valuables that someone might... You saw the house. They have nothing. I used to give Mum money sometimes. Without him knowing. He was too proud. There was a horse. A white horse. Eva? He bolted. He's so old. He'll be lost. I'm glad you were there. When she went. Thank you. I should have been there. My mum and dad... You've got your life. (Voices) We do have some prints from the living room, but nothing on the rope yet. I still think there must have been two of them...for that carnage. Anne-Britt says she tried to say something, the woman. Maria. I don't think it's anything, really. I mean, look at the state she was in. She was... she was dying... She was... It sounded like... "farmer", I don't know, maybe. There was an "f". "Foreigner", I suppose. It could have been "foreigner". Foreigner? It could have been. I'm just saying... Did she say anything about colour? Now, hang on a minute! It wouldn't have to be black. There are migrant workers from all over around here now. The place is swamped with them... No, Magnus. Not "swamped", OK? Most foreign workers in this country have a perfectly legitimate right to be here. Asian maybe? If it was dark, maybe she just heard someone speak. How dark was it? Look, it might not have been "foreigner". I just said that's one of the things it sounded like. The press are downstairs. Thank you, Petters. Right. Let's make this official. We don't mention the foreigner thing, OK? OK? Not to the press. That goes for all of you, right? Man : What do you think happened to Johannes and Maria Lovgren? Did they disturb a robbery? Nothing appears to have been stolen, but we do ask that anyone in the vicinity please come forward. So, do you have any leads at all? We're pursuing several lines of inquiry. That's why we're asking that people come forward at this stage. Any information could be useful to us. Sorry, I... Excuse me. (Reporters ask questions) Lisa : We will keep you informed. Thank you. He'd been working through the night. I took him some coffee in the studio this morning, and he'd gone. He'd cut out his pictures from the frames, Kurt. What are you doing, Dad? There's an exhibition, in Rimini. It's all organised, all arranged. You're getting a little bit confused, Dad. We went to Italy. We got back a couple of weeks ago. We had a great time. My exhibition! I have to work. Dad, you're shivering. I have to work. You all right there, Mr Wallander? You're fine. You're fine. Now, just sit down here. You're absolutely fine. Lots of people here that are going to help you. The doctor's going to come and see you in a moment. How did he get here? It's OK. A couple of farm workers found him. Jamal? They brought me down to translate. He was wandering through a field out beside the E65. They brought him in here. Thank you. He's my father. (Jamal translates and man responds) He says your father was very confused, anxious. He's got... His brain... (Jamal translates) Thank you very much. Thank you. Really appreciate it. Thank you so much. You can take your father home. You do realise that he will only get worse now? His condition is progressive. He'll level out for a bit and then crash again. He'll begin to lose his physical faculties. He'll be angry, sad, frightened, delusional, sometimes violent. You should think about making suitable arrangements. Don't put me away. For God's sake, don't put me away. Gertrude : It's all right, Povel. Dad, he was just... (Mobile rings) Sorry, er... (Mobile rings and buzzes) Yes? OK. OK. Yeah. I'm sorry, Dad. I'll...I'll come round later, Dad. Lars Herdin, Maria Lovgren's brother. I thought you should hear this from him. He had a fortune. In the house?! I don't know where he kept it. I'm just telling you, he had money. What kind of money? Horse meat. Sold them on the black market across the Iron Curtain. He invested the money, made a fortune out of it. But his farm was totally run down. Well, he didn't spend it on the bloody farm, did he? Or his family. Maria never even knew it existed. The whole thing was... a lie. I never trusted him from the first time I met him, so I asked around a bit and put two and two together, cos I knew there was money there. So, you say this money wasn't in the house? But it was invested, you say? Yeah. Could anybody else have known about it, think it was in the house, maybe? I...don't know. But he had a woman - I know that. Another woman. A mistress? And a son. Who is this woman? Is she still alive? I've never found out who she was. There was this old farmer, he said he'd seen them together. With a young boy. What farmer? He's dead now. But he said that Lovgren boasted to him one night, drunk, that he'd paid this woman off, regular. Well, that was enough for me. I didn't want to know any more. Cos I didn't want to destroy what Maria had - or what she thought she had. And by this time, she'd already given him a daughter - Hanna. So, I just thought... it was best left. We need to get round the banks. See if we can find this money. My bet is it'll be at the Sparbanken. That's where all the old farmers used to bank. TV : 'Police are believed to be searching for foreign suspects in connection with the brutal murder last night of an elderly couple in Lunnarp. Johannes and Maria Lovgren were thought to be having dinner...' Kurt, I think you should see this. '..Sources close to the investigation have revealed to TV4 News that Maria Lovgren is believed to have identified her killer as foreign just moments before she died...' How the hell did they get hold of that? How?! '..And now back to the studio.' Right, well, someone's leaked that to them. But I don't think it was anyone here... Right, well, who else knew? Cos I expressly said not to tell anyone about what she said. Magnus : You said not to tell the press. Meaning...? Well, I guess around the station... You blabbed, did you? You opened your big bloody mouth? It was mentioned, Kurt. It was bound to be. You know what this'll do, don't you? There'll be a bloody witch-hunt! There are idiots just waiting for any excuse... But you did say you thought she said the word "foreigner". I said maybe! Maybe! And it's still an area we have to cover. Well, I thought we'd knocked this on the head. I understand your fears, but we can't afford to let correctness... I am not interested in correctness. I'm interested in the truth. And I just don't think that now the truth stands much chance. Right, I want you to issue a denial, Lisa, OK? To the press. A denial. Johannes Lovgren had three accounts with us. Any recent withdrawals? This is the one with the most activity. There's over ten million kronor in this. Last withdrawal - two days ago. 100,000 kronor. And before that? April. Same amount. January... So, what, every quarter? Yeah. Was his wife a signatory on this account? No. I-I'd like to talk to whoever paid the money out to Lovgren, that last withdrawal. Is that possible? Certainly, yes. Thanks. (Footsteps) Britta-Lena Boden. I've had to close her station, so if you wouldn't mind... I'll be as quick as I can. Sure. Kurt Wallander. Hi. Please have a seat. Please sit down. Was there anything unusual about him? I mean, did he seem nervous at all or on edge or...? No. How did he want the money, can you remember? 500-kronor notes, I think. A few 100s. It'll be on file. I'm not sure I know what that much money looks like. What did he do with it? Pockets, or did he have a bag or...? He had a bag. I remember that. It was an old shoulder bag, brown, quite old-fashioned. Was he alone? I think so, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm certain he was. Anyone waiting for him in the bank or outside that you saw? I really wouldn't have noticed. Difficult to tell with the fair on. There's so many people about. It'll be on the CCTV, won't it? So Herdin was right. That's Lovgren taking out the money in cash on his own, and that's the bag, the brown shoulder bag. So we've got a potential motive - robbery. Yeah. We need to find this mistress and the son. I've spoken to the TV news people. They're holding firm on the "foreigner" thing. Nyberg for you. Thinks he might have something on the rope. Tell him to hang on. I want to get out. Would you mind...? Thanks. (Horn sounds) The guy in the chandlery thinks it could be a sailor's knot, similar to something he's seen used on the cargo boats. Have you checked it? Yeah, I've put a call in to the port authorities. But I think that knot is foreign. Anyone can tie a knot, though, can't they? I saw the news earlier. Not helpful. No. Not helpful. How's your dad? Not great. I suppose that's all round the station now, is it? Do you want to get a pizza tonight? Thanks, I think I'll take a spin around Hagstromm. The migrant camp? You think there's going to be trouble? Linda's got a new boyfriend. Doctor. You know, intern. Jamal. Jamal? Yeah, he's Syrian. Well, he's Swedish, you know. Met him a couple of times now. He's a good lad. You sure you don't want that pizza? Thanks. Watch yourself. (Shouting) Wallander. Fire at the migrant site at Hagstromm. Get out an alert. All services. Repeat, all services. (She shouts) Is anyone in there? There? People? Get away! Get away! Argh! (Glass shatters) (Kurt coughs) (Screaming) (Sirens wail) Kurt, you should go home. You've been here all night. You've burned your hand. Let me get one of the paramedics. It's OK. (Mobile rings) Oh... Yeah, Wallander. Man : 'This is the beginning, Wallander.' Who is this? 'Find the foreign scum who murdered that couple, or we'll take someone for them.' No, wait, wait, wait, wait! It's started. What do you expect, Dad, spreading poison about foreigners? No-one's spreading poison. You may as well have. It was a leak. It was an accident. What kind of accident is that?! "The police think it may be a foreigner." So that's why you're here, is it? No, I'm here because of Grandad. Why didn't you call me? Jamal said you just left him in the hospital. I didn't just leave him. I got a call. I said I'd... What's it got to do with Jamal, anyway? He's a doctor. That's his job. Yeah, well, this is my job. What have you got against him, Dad? Who? Jamal. Nothing. I've got nothing against him. I hope not. I really hope not. And what's that supposed to mean? Linda! Linda! Your mystery call - traced it to a payphone. Service station on the E65. Do you think it's genuine? We need to set up watches on all the sites in the area. And we need to find this Lovgren killer. We've got to bury this before it gets totally out of hand. Now, we've got good reason to believe that it was a robbery, right, that someone knew that Lovgren had that money in cash. The mistress. Well, so let's find her. Priority. And the son, this illegitimate child. Maybe if we can find out when she was seen, how old the boy was, check the birth records, maybe trace them through that. I mean, the birth would have to have been recorded as "father unidentified", wouldn't it? It's a bit of a long shot. Well, what else do you suggest? We need to know exactly when you knew about the mistress. It's like I said, it was rumours. And then this old farmer that saw them... When? When did he see them? It's all a long time ago. Think. Was it before Maria had her daughter? Eh? You said before that you didn't pursue this, because Maria had had a daughter. Oh, yeah, that's right! Because she was pregnant when all this came about. b*st*rd Lovgren! So what year was Hanna born, then? Oh, er... Er... We can look this up. No, no. It was 1964. It was the year I bought this farm here. I remember... What about the boy, this child that this farmer said he saw. How old was he? Now, think about it. Did he say anything about a pram or a pushchair or...? Well, how did he describe him? Was he a baby? Was he a toddler? A toddler, yes! He said that she was walking along holding his hand. He said she was holding his hand. I remember that... Right, thanks. OK, the boy was walking, so he's two, maybe three. He's seen in 1964, when Maria Lovgren was pregnant. That means we're looking for a child born, father unidentified, somewhere in the area in the year '61, '62. I know. Just let me know as soon as you've got anything, will you? I'll... I'm going to...I'm going to take another look at the farm. So, the brown bag was in the barn, and the stable door was forced deliberately by hand before the horse bolted. That's what scared it. The Lovgrens were both tortured to find out where the money was. He kept his mouth shut, then whoever it was threatened to hang Maria. She didn't know anything about any money. Finally, they got it out of him. I'll check it for prints. They're still processing the ones from the house, but no matches yet. OK. I've got a list of women here. Fatherless children, 1961-62. Don't tell me there are hundreds. No, four in the Skane region. Four? I've traced them all through the Citizens' Register. One's dead. One emigrated to Australia in 1975. That leaves one in Gladsax and one in Simrishamn. Right. Who's first? Thank you. That's very, very kind of you. Have you heard of a man called Johannes Lovgren? Johannes Lovgren? A farmer from Lunnarp. He was murdered two nights ago. The murders! Yes, I saw it on the TV. Foreigners. These migrant people, I suppose. Well, we don't know that for sure. But you've never heard of this man? No. Why should I have? I don't understand. Mrs Johansson, in March of 1962, you gave birth to a son, Stefan. Father's name was listed as unknown. What has this got to do with...? Was Johannes Lovgren the father of your son? No! I already told you. I've never heard of this man. What is this about? I'm sorry to have to bring this up, Mrs Johansson. Stefan's father was a man named Rune Stierna. He was married. That's why I withheld his name. We had a perfectly cordial relationship, and Stefan gets on extremely well with his father. I see. Then I'm sorry to have disturbed you. You people have a hell of a nerve, coming around here and dragging all this up. This is a murder inquiry. I'm afraid it's what happens. Thank you for your time. (Mobile rings) Gertrude? Gertrude : 'It's Povel. 'He's lost control.' Jesus... 'I think he's having some kind of fit.' OK. I can't stop him, Kurt... It's OK. It's OK. Dad... Dad... Dad, Dad... Let me go! No! Stay off me! Keep away from me! Stay away! Stay... I've got to clear my mind. Clear the space, you see? In here. Space. Space. Dad... Hey, hey! Hey, Dad, Dad... I won't let it beat me. Gertrude : Thank you for coming over. Are you all right? Fine. It must be so difficult. It's what happens. 
 
 (Man talks in his native language) (Gunshot) (Phone rings) Hello. Man : 'This is for the farmer. The next one will be for his wife.' (Call ends and mobile rings) Yeah... (Wailing) Nyberg : Can we please keep her away from the body? Man : Could you just stand back away from the body...? Migrant worker from the caravan site. Shotgun. Point-blank range. Nyberg : I'm sorry, this is a crime scene. Please. No, you have to stay away from the body. Man : Back. Back away from the body, please. (Woman shouts) Just leave her. Leave her! (Sobbing) TV : 'Various homes of migrant workers and foreign nationals in the area were attacked, and in one case a burning cross was planted outside a site on the outskirts of Ystad. The police have been patrolling the area throughout the night, and Chief of Police Lisa Holgersson gave this statement earlier this morning.' 'This is the work of a small, fanatical minority. We will find who is responsible, and they will be brought to justice. It is the duty of anyone who knows or who saw anything to contact their local police.' This is the initial ballistics report from Nyberg. It's regular buckshot. Gyttorp brand. Nytrox 36, most likely. Like pretty much every other shotgun in the country, then. Are we checking out the far right groups in the area? Yes. And your mystery caller didn't say anything you could go on? Just that they were going to take someone for Lovgren's wife next. I'm going to call in the National Crime people. No, this is local. We find the Lovgren killer, we can put a stop to all this. Just give me time to find the mistress, Lisa. Just let me have time for that. (Phone rings) Why can't we put someone else onto that, check out these women? Because this is mine. Because it started with me. Cos that's where it'll end. It's Anne-Britt. Thinks she might have a witness - one of the migrant workers. He's over here. Iranian. Please. Thank you. Hello. Please sit down, sir. Thank you very much. Perhaps you could tell us what you saw, exactly, last night. I was putting my children in bed and then I heard a bang. I...I looked out of the window and I saw a man...at the track. Can you describe the man that you saw? Like a farmer. Boots. Overall. And face? He was walking away. But he was tall, no hair... Bald. Some at side. Hair at side. And with a beard. What colour? (Man talks in his native language) Um...Swedish colour. Er, blond. And was he carrying anything? He had his hands down. But few minutes more, car down on the road... start up and drive away. So you saw it? No. It was blocked by the trees. But I heard it. It was a Merc. An old Merc. How can you...? When I was a boy in Tehran, we used to play a game - to tell a car by listening. Westerners' cars. Mercedes. German. Easy. Can we go public on that? "The police are looking for a car that might sound like an old Merc"?! We'd look like idiots. Better have a word around the sites. Might be something. He might be right. So where do we reckon this car was? Over there...we think. Not much in the way of tracks - ground's too hard. And where was our guy hiding? Hi, Magnus. We might have something on the car. Let's bag these up, please. And get Nyberg over here to take a look at these tracks. They're not great, but I think there might be something. Two of them, I reckon. Mr Cool over there in the corn with his shotgun and Mr Jittery puffing away here, waiting. It was planned? Yeah. The only thing they didn't know was who was going to be walking down that path. And they didn't care, as long as he was foreign. (Mobile rings) Hoglund. When? OK, yeah. Got it. Thanks. 1975 Merc reported stolen, taken last night. Last night? Why has it taken till now to report it? Owner's been away. Just come back to find it missing. Yeah, been staying with a friend for a couple of days. Came back this morning, and it was gone. So how did you know it was stolen last night? Neighbour across the road saw it there yesterday evening. Missing this morning. So, you've been away, Mr Bergman? Yeah, couple of nights. My lady. We live separately. Why didn't you drive? Where is she? Other side of town. She picked me up. We'd been out. Ended up at hers. Hey, come on, why all the questions? I'm not the guilty one here. Show me where you left it, please. This is where I parked it. Whereabouts was it parked? Woman : In front of the house. OK, I think that's all we need, ma'am. Thanks for your help. OK. Thank you, Mr Bergman. We'll be in touch as soon as we've got any news. Thank you. 1975 brown Merc. Can't be too many of those around. Shall I issue this? Sure. And see what you can find on Bergman soon as you get back. He's not going to report his car missing if he's committed a murder in it, is he? Why not? Clears him straight away. If you're hoping to get away with a random killing, why do you steal a car from a quiet residential street in the middle of the night under a row of blazing streetlamps, eh? Because you're, like, really devious? Nothing. Bergman's totally clean. Yeah, well, there's something wrong. Anyway, he reported it before anyone knew that was the car we were looking for. No, before the public knew that that was the car that we were looking for. What if he knew we knew about the Merc? How would he know that? Well, the same way the press got hold of this foreign thing, how this all started, Magnus. No, let's get this in proportion, Kurt. This started with an elderly couple being tortured and murdered, and you hearing one of them say the word "foreigner". No! I said I THOUGHT that may be what I heard. Someone in this station's leaking information. Well, prove it, Kurt. I'm going back to Bergman's house. (Horse neighs) He came in this morning. I don't care what the prosecutor said, Lisa. These are my cases, both of them. You're not getting anywhere, Kurt. You need to rest. I want Bergman staked out 24/7. You've got no proof of anything! Bergman's taking the piss, reporting that car missing. Someone in this station's talking to him. OK. I'll detail a couple of... No, I want Anne-Britt and Magnus. No, you can't... I want people I can trust. Well, what about Lovgren's mistress? There's one more - Ellen Magnusson. OK. Come on. Oh, I'm sorry, Inspector, I'm afraid I can't help you. I've never heard of Johannes Lovgren. But you've read about these cases, the murders? Well, yes, but that's got nothing to do with me. I'm sorry I couldn't have been more useful to you. But you did have a son, father's name unregistered? Erik, yes. So who was Erik's father? Well, I don't think that's got anything to do with anything. It was such a long time ago. We all make mistakes. I know this must seem intrusive and I do apologise, but I have to know who the father of your son was. Who was he? OK, Miss Magnusson, let's cut this nonsense, shall we? We know Johannes Lovgren was Erik's father. No! This is a murder inquiry. It's a double murder. You're withholding evidence and wasting police time - both serious offences that you'll have to answer to in a court of law. I'm sorry. Why won't this ever leave me alone? It's OK. So, please, just tell us the truth. I was young. A bit naive, I suppose. And he was...quite forceful. I got pregnant with Erik. He wanted me to have an abortion, but I couldn't do that. So he gave you money? I suppose he paid me for my silence. You carried on seeing him? He visited. With the money. Why do you have to know all this? Did Erik know who his father was? No. When he was young, he just thought he was a friend. When he got older, I made sure he never met Johannes. I didn't want him tainted with it. So what about the money? Well, originally I put it into a trust fund for Erik. I thought that he could decide what to do after I'd gone. But then, when he died... He died? Yes. Erik died, Inspector. Eight years ago. I... We... I didn't... I thought you must have known that, Inspector. I'm sorry. But the money? Lovgren still paid you the money? Why shouldn't he? I wanted him to pay for the rest of his life. All of the law, Inspector, is not in a book. Could she be involved? Well, it sounds like she was angry enough. And the son checks out? Yeah. It was an industrial accident in Vancouver. Four guys killed when a bridge they were building collapsed. I'm still certain that someone knew there was money in that house. Well, maybe whoever it was just got lucky. Hit the farmhouse, old couple, thought they were the type to have money stashed. Finally got Lovgren to own up. No, they brought that rope with them. There's nothing on it that matches up with anything on the farm. And did we run a check on the docks? Magnus : What's to check? We've got no descriptions. We don't even know how many we're looking for. We have nothing. We still don't have a single shred of evidence on who might have killed that old couple. Except what Maria Lovgren said - or what she may have said. We don't know what Maria Lovgren said. And there's still someone threatening to seek some kind of revenge for her. Where are we on that? Anything from Anne-Britt on Bergman? No. Right, I'll take tonight. Kurt... It's mine. I'll take it, OK? Thank you. (Knocking) I thought Magnus was doing tonight. Was there anything? Shopping. Betting shop. He had a pizza. How'd he get about? Taxis. You think this is a waste of time? I think I agree with you. Have we got nothing on him? Lovgrens? Nothing. How's your dad? He's fine. He's fine. Go on. You get some sleep. Get some sleep. (Beeping) (Buzzing) Man on intercom : 'Yes?' Alfred, it's Bergman. (Door is released) (Low voices) Bergman : ..I mean, they know about the car! Alfred : I told you not to come. I'm worried. There's police everywhere. You've reported the car. You're clear. Just relax. We were only supposed to frighten them. That was all we were going to do. Ha! You know exactly what we were... What was that? I heard something. Wait there. It's nothing. You can't back out now, Bergman... Bergman! (Door slams) (Door slams) Police! Hold it there! Hold it! Police! Stop! (Gunshot) (Gunshot) Wallander. I need assistance. Borrby Motel - now! No... Oh! Oh, no! What have I...? You? You were the leak? I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Valfrid Strom. Nationalist. Neo-Nazi. He comes up on lists all through Europe. He's not local. Came down from Stockholm. And Bergman? Picked him up earlier. He came clean about the Merc. They've got it in a lock-up. The guys are fetching it now. He's a recent convert. Didn't show on the database. Way out of his depth with Strom. And we've got Petters downstairs. Do you want to talk to him? Kid can't stop crying. I think he was traumatised by seeing the Lovgren murder. He thought we were withholding information, so he leaked to the press. The kid didn't think it could come to this. What did he think, then? What did he think? I've had to confiscate your gun, Kurt. There'll have to be an investigation. The prosecutor is on his way down. You'll be suspended. What about the Lovgren murders? We'll have to do what we can. That's my case, Lisa. That's my case! We're nowhere, Kurt. The whole thing's a complete mess. Go home, Kurt. I never thought I'd do that. I never thought I'd actually take another man's life. (Phone rings) Hoglund. Right. ..The prosecutor. He's on his way. Reporter : 'Inspector Kurt Wallander has been suspended today pending an investigation into last night's shooting and killing of a suspect in last week's racist murders. The dead suspect is believed to be Valfrid Strom. Strom was a member of several Neo-Nazi groups and is believed by police to have orchestrated many of the recent attacks on foreign workers.' (Mobile phone rings) Hi. 'Dad, I've just seen the news.' Sure. 'How can they suspend you?' I killed a man. 'They said he was shooting at you.' That's not the point. 'Dad, doesn't that make it self-defence? Look, Dad, do you want me to come round?' No, I'm fine. How are you? How's Jamal? 'Yeah, yeah. We're good. You're sure you're OK?' Really. Thanks for calling. 'OK, bye.' Bye. Do you fancy that pizza? It was bound to happen one day. You must have known that. Who's going to take the Lovgren case? Anne-Britt and Martinsson, I guess. I don't know. We're nowhere on it. I thought if we could find the mistress, the son, there'd be a connection. Nothing. So where does that leave you? God knows. What did she say? Maria Lovgren. She said something to you that night before she died. I don't know. I don't know what she said. When did you first meet Jamal? I don't know, a couple of weeks ago. What did you think? What did I think? What do you mean? Nothing. I didn't think anything. You were surprised, weren't you? Well, that's crap. Why would I be surprised? What are you saying? What...? What do you think I'm saying? Face it, man. Why does it matter?! It doesn't matter. He's a really nice guy. She's smiling again. That's all that matters. There was a beat. When I first saw him, there was something. Some thing inside me. I couldn't get it out of my head. I couldn't shake it off. And then...when... when I thought Maria said something, I thought it might have been... "Foreigner". But was that just me? I don't know. Was that what I heard or was that just knocking around my stupid, little provincial head? It's natural. Is it? It works both ways. It's in all of us. It's how we deal with it that counts. I never thought it was in me. And now people are dead. People that... Strom's gun wasn't loaded. He'd have killed you in a beat, Kurt. You had no choice. I wanted it to be him. His fault. All of this. I just wanted to kill it. Self defence. You've just... You've just got to live with it. I've only got euros. Italy... I don't believe this. I've come out without my wallet. Er...um... Oh, there you go. That one's out of date. I need to get to the bank. I'll get it to you tomorrow. We're police officers. Just who the hell do you think you are? Your receipt. Thanks very much. Could I have that in fifties, please? You don't want any other denominations? I need you to line up the CCTV from the bank, all of it, Lisa, please. Money in, gets ID. Now, see. He's picking up his receipt like the guy I stood behind. We've seen all this before. A second camera. Two of them behind Lovgren in the queue. You see, the receipt's on the counter. The one in front sees Lovgren getting the cash and he sees the receipt. With Lovgren's address. Exactly. You can practically see him reading it. Can we get a print of this? Is there enough? We can play with it. Done. We need to get back around all the foreign worker sites. What ethnicity do you think they are? Foreigners, Kurt. Yes, foreigners. So what about the knot? The noose. Sailor's knot, you said. Could be. We could try the harbour people again now we've got pictures. Crew members have to be registered with immigration when they come ashore, don't they? We have ID, we have fingerprints. Whoever killed the Lovgrens left prints everywhere. They were either very stupid or very green. Or they didn't expect to be on record. I think we're definitely looking at someone just visiting the country. So, it's a short stay. They know they're not going to be here long enough to get traced. Tourists? What would tourists be doing with industrial rope? The fair. The summer fair. The fair. Travellers. Itinerants, knots! I can't let you go out on this, Kurt. You're suspended. I have to see this through, Lisa. I have to. No. Hey, you, blondie, come and try this. For you, free. Police. Stop! Hold it! Get down now. Down. (Man shouting) (Shouting) (Shouting) (Gunshot) (Shouting) (Sirens blare in distance) (Gun clicking) Gun's down. Enough. (Mobile phone rings) Hello. Yes. Yes, this is his son. Right, I see. Of course. I'll come now. He was fine. Quiet. He kissed me goodbye when I went shopping. He hasn't done that for a long time. I thought it meant we were OK. You know? I came back and he'd gone. He admitted himself a couple of hours ago. He was insistent. He had a doctor's note, everything. My mind's weak, my brain. Well... not that weak, I can still see. I knew you wouldn't do anything. You didn't come. You ran away. I can paint. They'll let me paint here. Go home. I'll see you soon, Dad. Kurt, internal affairs are here. They want to see you at nine. Kurt? Kurt?
