 Hello? 
 Oh! 
 Hello! 
 Granddad! 
 Hi! 
 Oh, hello! 
 You gotta be careful with Granddad. 
 He is a very, very old person. 
 Now, should we put your shoes on? 
 Are these yours? 
 Oh, that's very nice! 
 Thank you very much. 
 Do you want to put that one on? 
 You do right and I'll do left. 
 That's a great picture. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Well, no, I've got the morning off, but I'll be back at 2:00 at the station, yep. 
 So if I take you to Africa, yeah, with Mommy and Daddy, which animals would you like to see? 
 Elephants. 
 Elephants, yeah, any others? 
 Um... lions? 
 Oh, quite scary. 
 Would you like to go up close to a lion? 
 No. 
 Do you know where an elephant packs his clothes? 
 No. 
 Well, an elephant packs his clothes in his trunk, of course. 
 And they've got very good memories. 
 Do you have a good memory? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 Elephants have got the best memories of all. 
 Right, so we have to get as many basil leaves as we can in ten seconds. 
 Oh, you missed one! 
 Missed one, missed one! 
 No, you got one, you got two... 
 It's me! 
 Oh, look who it is! 
 Go and say hello to Mommy, quickly! 
 Mommy! 
 Oh, hello! 
 Did you have a nice time with Granddad? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, we did. 
 We actually went to a cake shop. 
 Oh, did you? 
 Oh, what's that? 
 Granddad caught a robber! 
 Actually, we were walking the dog. 
 I was walking the dog, and there was a big slippery rock. 
 It was covered in seaweed, and I just went "Whoosh!" 
 And I fell. 
 Come on, let's finish this. 
 Granddad's a policeman. 
 Yes, I am a policeman. 
 So, how much pasta do we need? 
 One, two, three... 
 Oh, that's nice. 
 I like what you've done there. 
 Do you want to use that one to just... 
 Because if you see, on Granddad's grass, he's got a little red at the top, but he's also got a little white on the wings, hasn't he, which you've got. 
 Hello? 
 Oh look, it's Daddy! 
 Kurt. 
 Hi, Hans. 
 Hi! 
 Hello? 
 Grandpa! 
 Hello? 
 Hello! 
 What are you doing here? 
 Long story. 
 Oh, my little Klara. 
 Kurt! 
 They've been keeping us apart. 
 If I had known that you were coming, we'd have... 
 When was the last time? 
 Klara's christening? 
 Hello. 
 Hello, Linda. 
 Now, who do you think this is for? 
 I've just been helping Dad. 
 He's just here for the afternoon. 
 Okay. 
 How's the police? 
 Yes, uh, not bad. 
 Wow! 
 Oh, Haåkon, you shouldn't have! 
 Mom, it's a dollhouse! 
 Thank you, Grandpa. 
 Who do you think could live in here and here? 
 Grandfathers are meant to spoil. 
 Isn't that right, Kurt? 
 I have to get back to work, unfortunately. 
 You're coming to my birthday party? 
 Um... 
 It's about time we got to know each other. 
 Wednesday. 
 Please come -- everyone else is. 
 Sure, yeah, okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Let's go and find some friends! 
 I don't even have a suit. 
 You do. 
 He's only asking me to be polite. 
 He doesn't want me to come to his birthday party. 
 Linda, do you want to...? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll call you. 
 Look after yourself, Dad. 
 Yeah. 
 Bye, Hans, see you. 
 Bye bye, Klara! 
 Grandpa, no! 
 Hi. 
 Thank you. 
 What have you done? 
 Oh... 
 What is this? 
 Missing person? 
 Oh yeah, that's some old woman who's gone off from her old folks' home. 
 Eliasson's gone out to help. 
 He's fine. 
 Well, I'll... 
 You know, I'm supposed to be mentoring him, so I'll... 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I just slipped off a ladder, yeah. 
 It's fine. 
 All right. 
 So, on the print-out being handed out, there's a picture of Anita and also the local area. 
 Now, she's believed to have been missing since about 9:00 this morning. 
 We're gonna start our search just over there, just beyond the tree. 
 Oh, Kurt. 
 I thought you could do with a hand. 
 Thanks. 
 What is the temperature -- six, seven degrees? 
 Yeah. 
 And what was she dressed in? 
 Just nightclothes. 
 Right, sooner we go, the better. 
 Let's go. 
 Anita! 
 Anita? 
 Anita! 
 Anita! 
 Anita! 
 There she is. 
 Bring the blankets. 
 Yeah, we've found her. 
 The field through the trees. 
 Copy that. 
 There's nothing to worry about, Anita. 
 It's fine. 
 It's all gonna be okay, Anita. 
 Come on, let's get you up, let's get you up. 
 Anita, my name's Kurt. 
 My name's Kurt. 
 Please! Please! 
 Please! 
 Let's get you back home, get you warm. 
 Please! Please! 
 Let's get you warm. 
 Please, please... 
 Please! 
 Please! Please! 
 Yeah, the woman is back in her home now. 
 Eliasson's securing the scene. 
 She's been dead a few days, we think. 
 One of our boys recognized her -- Erika Hjelmqvist. 
 Lived in Skaåne Tranas. 
 Any children? 
 Teenage daughter. 
 And a husband? 
 Yeah, husband's dead. 
 She was stabbed twice. 
 There are also six or seven deep defensive wounds on her hands and wrists. 
 It looks like she may have fled into the fields, fell into the ditch. 
 No sign of a sexual assault. 
 The weapon used had a serrated edge. 
 Knife drawer in the kitchen is tipped onto the floor. 
 Bread knife, maybe? 
 There will have been a lot of blood. 
 Somebody tried to clean it up. 
 Right, okay, so the urgent priority is locating the daughter, Hannah Hjelmqvist. 
 So school, social security records, any friends. 
 I'll talk to the neighbors, thanks. 
 What happened? 
 Uh... nothing. 
 Is it Erika? 
 It's not Hannah? 
 I knew it would end in trouble. 
 Do you have any idea where Hannah might be? 
 Well, we've been away two weeks. 
 They were here just before we left. 
 You said it would end in trouble. 
 What were you talking about? 
 The bikers. 
 The motorcycle club. 
 They make a hell of a lot of noise, come through here, 110k an hour. 
 Which bikers? 
 Well, Erika's husband got into a row with this gang, or whatever they say they are. 
 They rented a farm from him. 
 Her husband Anders, he's dead, is that correct? 
 Last year. 
 He went up there. 
 He got into an argument. 
 He came home, he had a heart attack. 
 That was it. 
 49. 
 This was a violent argument? 
 Pushing and shoving, I think, but they just... 
 You know, it was the stress of it. 
 It was an accident waiting to happen. 
 She's trying to have them evicted. 
 Or was. 
 Has Erika had any trouble with them since? 
 All the time. 
 Horrible. 
 I'm going to ask one of my officers to take a more detailed statement from you. 
 Can you tell me where the motorcycle club is? 
 Towards Fyledalen. 
 It's along there. 
 You'll know it when you see it. 
 All right, thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Can you take her statement? 
 Yeah. 
 You're a policeman. 
 Wallander. 
 What's your name? 
 A woman from Skaåne Tranas has been found stabbed in a field just outside of the village. 
 We think she's Erika Hjelmqvist. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 Erika Hjelmqvist, who owns this farm. 
 When you say stabbed, you mean she's dead? 
 When was the last time you saw her? 
 Her daughter Hannah is missing. 
 Have you seen her? 
 Well, if you hear anything about it or if you think of anything, will you call me? 
 Yeah, I'll call you. 
 Hello? 
 Hi Dad, it's me. 
 Hi. 
 Listen, I'm sorry about earlier -- Haåkon. 
 What are you sorry about? 
 The birthday party. 
 It'd be nice if you could come, though. 
 Their house is quite something. 
 Uh, yeah... 
 When was it? 
 This Wednesday. 
 Wednesday, Haåkon. 
 It's a bit of a drive. 
 Do you think you can make it? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'll make sure. 
 Oh, that would be great. 
 Oh, and Klara wants to say goodnight. 
 There you go, sweetie. 
 Night night, Granddad! 
 Night night, Klara Bo Bo Bo! 
 All right. 
 I'll speak to you soon, Dad. 
 Yeah, good night, sweetheart. 
 Good boy, good boy. 
 Good boy, come here. 
 That's a good dog. 
 Good boy, good boy. 
 No! 
 Wallander! 
 Do you have any idea what happened? 
 Detective, do you have a statement? 
 Yeah, I'm sure that there will be a statement, but it will be later in the morning, later in the morning, thanks. 
 Kurt? 
 Oh, hi. 
 We found two blood traces at the house. 
 DNA suggests it's mother and child. 
 Three sets of fingerprints in the blood in the kitchen area. 
 Erika's; Hannah's probably, judging by other prints in her bedroom; and one set unidentified. 
 Come in, sit down. 
 So, Hannah hasn't been seen since the mother disappeared, which is approximately, what, six days ago? 
 Yep. 
 We haven't found the mobile, but we know that it hasn't been used. 
 So given the evidence, we need to work on the assumption that she was attacked herself, potentially kidnapped. 
 So what information do we have about Hannah? 
 Born in 2000, parents were Anders and Erika Hjelmqvist. 
 Fostered by a family in Landskrona between the ages of five and nine. 
 Reunited with her parents in March 2009. 
 And why was she fostered? 
 The mother had severe post-natal depression -- institutionalized briefly -- and compounded by alcohol dependency problems. 
 And what detail do we have on this motorcycle gang? 
 Gustav Ericsson is the man with his name on the lease. 
 Long record: assault, drugs -- possession, dealing. 
 Spent six years in prison in Copenhagen for manslaughter. 
 What about this property dispute? 
 Erika was trying to have them evicted. 
 Standard landlord/tenant dispute. 
 She started the proceedings after her husband died. 
 Who are the lawyers on that? 
 Larsson, Skaåne Tranas. 
 Yeah, I know her. 
 So... right. 
 You coordinate the vulnerable and missing persons protocols, and I will talk to Rita Larsson. 
 Yep, no problem. 
 Thanks. 
 Inspector? 
 Detective, do you have any suspects? 
 There's... we can't say anything. 
 There's nothing to say. 
 Can you tell me anything about Hannah? 
 Have you found her? 
 My colleagues are putting together a statement. 
 No, I'm not a journalist. 
 We were fostered together, Hannah and me. 
 Right, okay. 
 Seven years ago. 
 I just saw it. 
 I read about her going missing, and... 
 You see her recently, or heard from her? 
 I'm just worried. 
 Is she okay? 
 We're doing everything we can to find her. 
 Listen, I need you to give your details to Emma here on reception. 
 We will definitely talk to you about this. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry I can't tell you anything more at the moment, but thank you for coming in. 
 Can I help you? 
 Uh, I came... 
 Lawyer... 
 Larsson... 
 Uh, Rita Larsson, lawyer's office. 
 You're sitting outside it. 
 Thanks, thanks. 
 I've seen a lot of her since her husband died. 
 She tried very hard to bring charges against them, but there was no violence. 
 They didn't kill him. 
 A lot of intimidation -- nothing illegal, though. 
 But she became obsessed by it. 
 She was very heavy-handed. 
 Why do you think her husband hired it to them in the first place? 
 He leased it to the one man -- Gustav Ericsson. 
 He had no idea he'd bring his friends with him. 
 And how far on are you in the eviction process? 
 It's been registered as an EM2 by the council. 
 Means it shouldn't be long now. 
 Is that public? 
 Can people know about that in advance? 
 No, but it's a small town, Kurt. 
 They probably had some idea which way the wind was blowing. 
 Erika would have told them about it if no one else did. 
 She would've yelled it through their letterbox. 
 Right. 
 Thanks, Rita. 
 I appreciate that. 
 I'd like permission to search the biker place. 
 There's a history of conflict between the Hjelmqvists and that group. 
 I think it's likely that they knew they were going to be evicted. 
 I'll chase it. 
 It might take a couple of hours. 
 I'll send Eliasson up when he comes through. 
 Kurt? 
 Right, thanks. 
 Now, if you'd just hold that down. 
 Thanks. 
 I mean, I'm not... 
 I just... 
 I don't know how it happened. 
 I was just standing there. 
 I was looking for my car, actually, and I heard motorbikes, and then I don't know what happened after that. 
 Well, you don't seem concussed. 
 There's no sign of bleeding. 
 It's very good you came in though, Kurt. 
 Good. 
 I mean, uh... 
 I'm just, uh... 
 What? 
 I'm dizzy, on and off. 
 Earlier today, out of nowhere, I... 
 There's nothing unusual with your glucose. 
 Are you eating? 
 Yeah, I'm taking care of myself. 
 I'm exercising regularly. 
 How's your balance? 
 Uh... 
 Well, I don't know. 
 There was a moment or two in South Africa where I was, uh... you know, light-headed for a couple of minutes. 
 I don't know if that's anything. 
 Are they getting more frequent, the dizzy spells? 
 I don't really know. 
 Diabetes is a serious condition, Kurt. 
 You know that. 
 I'm just, uh... 
 What? 
 I'm just, you know, thinking. 
 About how my dad, uh... 
 Kurt, don't overthink it. 
 We will absolutely run some tests, but I am sure you'll be fine. 
 You're 55. 
 You've got a stressful job, you're a diabetic, and you've just been beaten up, so don't work yourself up. 
 You going to say I'm not getting any younger? 
 Well, who is? 
 Thanks, that's a big, uh... 
 We have a warrant to search your property for evidence pertaining to the killing of Erika Hjelmqvist. 
 I can't say I'm entirely surprised. 
 We'll look in here first, thank you. 
 You want anything? 
 Coffee, or...? 
 Or do you just want to look around, see where the corpses are buried? 
 Thing is, you gave me warning, coming round the other day. 
 I've executed all the s*x slaves and flushed their body parts down the toilet. 
 It would be helpful if you could give us names and personal numbers of everyone who's here -- anyone who lives here permanently, anyone who visits. 
 That's gonna take a bit of time to organize. 
 I'd appreciate it, thank you. 
 Look around in the meantime, why not? 
 Shame people won't just allow us to be somewhere. 
 It's the only kindness I ask these days, just to be allowed to be somewhere, raise my boy in peace. 
 It's our sixth place in ten years. 
 Why is that? 
 Isn't going to do you any good asking me. 
 Ask them. 
 Ask her. 
 Get your Ouija board and ask her. 
 I don't have a problem with people. 
 I did six years for manslaughter, as you know. 
 I missed my son being born. 
 I missed him being a child. 
 That's something that hurts me every day. 
 You will not find a single bloody thing here. 
 You do the barn, yeah? 
 Sure. 
 Kurt! 
 Is this yours, sir? 
 You know bloody well it's not mine. 
 I'll cut your bloody throat with it. 
 Will you just calm down? 
 I'll cut your neck open! 
 Will you just calm down? 
 Look... 
 Stand back, all of you! 
 Put your hands up! 
 Sorry I have to go. 
 I don't really want to. 
 Go, it's fine. 
 They're going to take some getting through anyway. 
 All right, well, call me if there's anything at all. 
 Anything about Hannah. 
 Sure. 
 ♪ Slow strokes as we shine the chrome ♪ 
♪ I'm all wrapped up in styrofoam ♪ 
 Good afternoon. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Kurt! 
 Louise. 
 I hope it wasn't too long a journey for you. 
 No, it, uh... 
 What a beautiful house. 
 It's been in Haåkon's family for a long time. 
 Built in 1778. 
 You have some champagne? 
 Uh, yes. 
 I'll see if I can find Linda for you. 
 Kurt? 
 You fancy a drink? 
 Away from all this nonsense? 
 Do you see much of your ex-wife? 
 Inga? 
 Well... 
 She and Louise seem to get along. 
 I like her. 
 She seems very nice. 
 Pity she couldn't be here. 
 Yeah. 
 Odd, that one should be so much a part of somebody's life, and then... 
 Yeah, I don't see her very often. 
 I mean, we're perfectly fine these days, but I just... 
 Oh, I don't mean to pry. 
 Klara's a wonderful little girl. 
 Yes, she is. 
 Very bright, very light. 
 Very. 
 I hope she manages to hold on to the lightheartedness. 
 Most children seem to lose it sooner or later. 
 It's a rare thing, to be able to be happy. 
 It's different nowadays. 
 Happiness is something that people seem to think is their right. 
 They don't worry about starvation or having a roof over their head or being invaded, so they worry about whether they're happy or not. 
 I suppose that's some kind of progress. 
 Haåkon? 
 What is it? 
 Uh... 
 The autumn of 1980. 
 What were you doing then? 
 Police officer. 
 Just started. 
 35 years. 
 On the first of October, we had an alarm call. 
 A Russian submarine was in the Haårsfjaärden channel. 
 Foreign submarines in a restricted area. 
 You remember all the fuss? 
 I do. 
 Don't know what you could compare it with, really. 
 Maybe a Soviet helicopter landing outside the Royal Palace. 
 That's what it felt like. 
 We never got it, though. 
 They didn't let us. 
 They made us leave the submarines where they were because they didn't want an international incident. 
 I think it was the greatest betrayal in Swedish history. 
 I must go back to my party. I'm being rude. 
 
 
 
 Let me help. 
 Leave it, leave it. 
 Leave it! 
 I thought you'd gone to bed. 
 Oh, uh, about to. 
 Sorry, I'm in the middle of a... 
 There's a young girl gone missing. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Linda, come and talk to some of these people, will you? 
 I've got nothing to say to them. 
 Okay. 
 Night, Dad. 
 Night, sweetheart. 
 Yeah? 
 Kurt, it's Lennart. 
 I... 
 I have to rush back down to work. 
 It's an emergency. 
 Sorry. 
 I understand. 
 Oh, I must thank you for the painting. 
 Oh, it's nothing. 
 One of your father's? 
 One of many. 
 Of the same thing. 
 My dad always painted the same thing. 
 We all have our furrows to plough. 
 I go for the same walk every day. 
 Drink the same coffee, think the same thoughts. 
 You come to an age like mine, you start to realize it's impossible to be anybody other than you have always been. 
 Thank you, Kurt. 
 See you soon. 
 Hope so. 
 Sorry. 
 You're keeping my boy. 
 Why are you keeping my boy? 
 We can discuss this when I've taken... 
 I have a temper. 
 You've seen I have a temper. 
 Don't threaten me, I'm doing my job. 
 A woman's been murdered, a girl's gone missing. 
 I'm not threatening you. 
 I'm telling you that if you try and pin any of this on him, I'll hunt you down and I'll kill you. 
 The boy did nothing. 
 Now, you mess with my blood, I'll mess with yours, policeman or not. 
 You should go home. 
 So? 
 He's not talking. 
 The knife you found is the murder weapon. 
 His prints are on it, and they were in the Hjelmqvist place. 
 He was there clearing it up. 
 What were you doing at Erika and Hannah Hjelmqvist's house? 
 Were you there at any point between the 10th and the 16th of October? 
 Do you want something to eat? 
 You can answer that without incriminating yourself. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 So, why would you kill two people? 
 For your father? 
 For that farm? 
 That was, what, your tenth house in six years? 
 Two people dead? 
 Hey Pontus, do you want to tell me what really went on? 
 Because we just want to know what's happened to Hannah. 
 Fine. 
 So, later on today, Pontus, we're going to charge you formally with the murder of Erika Hjelmqvist. 
 And we're going to continue to interview you tomorrow. 
 Kurt. 
 Yep? 
 I was thinking, as far as Hannah goes, maybe she was spooked. 
 Sorry? 
 Her mother ran away, she ran off. 
 She didn't die where she was attacked. 
 I can't think of many mothers who would leave their daughter behind. 
 Maybe they both got out. 
 Maybe she's still alive. 
 If she escaped but she was injured, where might she go? 
 Where do you think we haven't concentrated? 
 The foster family. 
 Yeah, you're right. 
 That's exactly where we should go. 
 Oh, there's someone in reception to see you. 
 Okay, let's go, then. 
 Baiba? 
 How are you? 
 Are you...? 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 I'm fine. 
 Are you fine? 
 I'm... I'm fine. 
 I... 
 What are you... 
 What are you doing here? 
 I have a concert in Copenhagen. 
 Right. 
 I saw a train to Ystad, and I thought it would be a surprise. 
 It is, yeah. 
 How is Linda, and Klara? 
 Klara, uh, great, they're both fine. 
 How are you? 
 I'm happier. 
 It's nice to be traveling and playing again. 
 And how long are you staying? 
 A few days. 
 So... 
 Kurt, you, uh...? 
 Yeah, I'm just... 
 Well, go. 
 Will you stay? 
 Because I... I don't want you to leave. 
 Take my keys, get a taxi, make yourself at home. 
 Well, we don't have to. 
 We could have a drink here later at the hotel. 
 I would like to. 
 Yeah? 
 Yes. 
 Hey, have you got a...? 
 Thank you. 
 Now, there is a slightly smelly black dog. 
 Jussi. 
 Jussi, well remembered. 
 He's very friendly. 
 I will try not to get lost on my way. 
 It's great to see you. 
 I had no idea. 
 I hadn't heard a thing. 
 There will have been a conspiracy to keep it from me. 
 They won't have wanted me to worry, but that's just stupid of them. 
 I mean, I fostered her for years! 
 Oh, Christ, poor thing. 
 We don't know that she's necessarily come to any harm. 
 Well, she hasn't come to any good, has she? 
 Well, if she was afraid, or... 
 Has she been in touch with you recently? 
 No. 
 At all, since she was fostered? 
 No. 
 This is her. 
 She couldn't sleep with the light off. 
 Little puppet she called Mouse she wouldn't let go of. 
 She called it Mouse, but it was a dog. 
 You try to turn them around, give them some love, stability, and you hope they turn out well. 
 Well, she went back to her parents. 
 Yes, they were still together. 
 I mean, that's unusual. 
 She was very sad to go. 
 And you haven't heard from her since? 
 No. 
 We write. 
 Photographs at Christmas, little birthday things. 
 Some of them write back. 
 Some of them visit. 
 I sent her a note when Rasmus died last year -- my husband. 
 Did she reply? 
 No. 
 Well, I suppose it's better if they don't, to be honest. 
 If we've done it well, they should be happy to forget us. 
 Hi, Maja. 
 Hello, darlings. 
 Hi, Maja. 
 Hi! 
 Well, I better get these ones fed, if you don't mind. 
 We'll be in touch as soon as we know anything. 
 Now then, what will we have? 
 No, he's really fit. 
 I mean, I even took him to my yoga class once. 
 Yoga? 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, that was a mistake... 
 Uh, hello everybody! 
 Hello! 
 Hello, Granddad! 
 Hello, you! 
 Good to see you! 
 You have lots of guests. 
 And Linda is coming to my concert. 
 Really? 
 Well, the more, the merrier. 
 Are you gonna stay for din dins tonight? 
 No, we're long overdue. 
 Okay. 
 I've got to get this one to bed. 
 Come here. 
 No, we were, um... 
 We were really just checking if you were okay, which clearly you are, so we're just going to say good night. 
 All right. 
 Say bye to Granddad. 
 Bye, Granddad. 
 Say bye to Baiba. 
 Bye, Baiba! 
 Ata! 
 Have a nice evening. 
 See you soon. 
 Take it easy. 
 Sleep well and drive safe, please. 
 You don't have a piano? 
 No. 
 Every house should have a piano. 
 A lady might come one time and want to play the piano for you. 
 Well, I will get one. 
 Can I help you? 
 What is it? 
 Look, I used to go over there every now and again after Anders died. 
 Help with the heavy stuff -- odd jobs, you know, fixing. 
 Right. 
 I screwed her a couple of times. 
 My wife doesn't know. 
 I mean, she was... 
 Erika was a bit wild. 
 I feel I took advantage, really. 
 She wasn't 100% in control. 
 So how do you mean? 
 Things weren't right between her and the girl. 
 They hadn't been right for a long time, not since she moved back in with them. 
 She didn't love her mom. 
 How can you know that? 
 Erika said so. 
 It's what she felt. 
 Her daughter hated her. 
 So they argued? 
 They argued like hell after he died. 
 She had a boyfriend, Hannah. 
 Whoever it was, she wouldn't say, but she was hardly there some weeks, stayed out all night. 
 And you have no idea who the boyfriend was? 
 No. 
 Thanks. 
 Was your son having a relationship with Hannah Hjelmqvist? 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 Had he shown any interest in her? 
 You know what that bitch of a mother was like with us? 
 I'd have killed her myself. 
 You've charged him? 
 That's what I heard. 
 With murder. 
 We're going to. 
 We have no choice unless you do something to help your son. 
 You think he could be so dumb? 
 Killing people, leaving a knife in a rubbish bag? 
 Somebody was that dumb. 
 I haven't got anything left. 
 I haven't got anything left! 
 Did you hear what I said? 
 Get out! 
 Just... think about it. 
 Think about it, she was an attractive girl. 
 You think about your son. 
 Sorry. 
 Bravo! 
 Bravo! 
 [Let's have a drink.] 
 Is he all right? 
 Jussi, are you all right? 
 Good boy. 
 You had an alarm. 
 In the kitchen. 
 You forgot to turn the gas off. 
 No, I didn't forget. 
 Kurt, it's not so bad. 
 We can clean this up. 
 No, I didn't forget, I didn't forget. 
 What I want... 
 I just want some... 
 I'm not... 
 I need to... 
 People are trying to scare me, that's what they're trying to do. 
 Kurt? 
 Gustav?! 
 What the hell do you think you're doing? 
 Kurt... 
 What are you doing here? 
 Kurt. 
 You know how much you'll serve? Arson? 
 25 years. 
 Kurt! 
 It's Hannah's. 
 It's her childhood toy and letters. 
 Where was that? 
 My son's things. 
 Stupid lad. 
 There it is, then. 
 He knew her, one way or another. 
 It's yours. 
 You do what you like with it. 
 Let me know, yeah? 
 What are you saying about arson? 
 What are you shouting about? 
 It's nothing, I... 
 Thank you. 
 Let me know. 
 Why would he have these? 
 These foster things. 
 None of them are addressed to her. 
 What? 
 These letters from the foster mother. 
 They're to "Dear Stefan." 
 Stefan was the name of her foster brother. 
 What, have we heard of him somewhere? 
 No. 
 Ah! 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 He was here the other day, he was asking about her. 
 That's him! 
 Come on, come on. 
 Kurt? 
 Excuse me, yeah, Stefan Persson, please? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Stefan? 
 Police are in my office, they want to see you. 
 Stefan! 
 Have you seen Hannah recently? 
 Have you seen Hannah recently? 
 We know she had your letters. 
 Why? 
 Why didn't you tell us? 
 Why didn't you tell us you had seen her? 
 I wasn't sure it... 
 When did you see her? 
 I didn't recognize her, okay? 
 I hadn't set eyes on her in seven years, then there was just this girl there, suddenly giving me this almighty hug. 
 She looked thin, and we sat and talked about the old days, when we were kids. 
 What was she doing when you saw her? 
 The train. 
 Catching a train to Tomellila to see her boyfriend. 
 Why does she have your letters? 
 She asked me why Maja and Rasmus, our foster parents, had never written to her. 
 She was really desperate about that. 
 I told her they must have done. 
 They always did, to all of us. 
 It was a point of principle. 
 She came home with me. 
 I gave her my old letters and things to read. 
 How did she react? 
 She was upset. 
 Her mom must have been keeping them from her. 
 Her mom would never allow her to get in contact because she'd been desperate to go back to Maja and Rasmus. 
 There was never much love lost between her and her birth mother. 
 And she was heartbroken when she read the letter about Rasmus -- that he was dead. 
 I put her on the train and she was still sobbing her heart out. 
 Did you see her again? 
 Did you see her again? 
 I said we'd meet up. 
 Then this happened. 
 I didn't know if she... 
 I mean, I knew she had a temper, but I wouldn't think for one second that she was capable of anything... 
 It's all right, thank you. 
 All right, Pontus. 
 So, we don't have much time, I don't think, so... 
 We know that you know Hannah. 
 We know that you care about her a lot. 
 We know that you're her friend. 
 So did she come to you for help? 
 Did you try and help her? 
 Did you keep her things safe? 
 Did you take care of her? 
 Did you clean up after her? 
 Did you clean everything up after her? 
 Just tell us, Pontus, what kind of state was she in? 
 She was terrified, I assume, absolutely terrified. 
 She'd fought with her mom. 
 She'd hurt her mom, she'd really hurt her mom because her mom had lied to her all these years, and you tried to help her because you care about her, because she was in a mess. 
 You must be terrified for her. 
 So where is she, Pontus? 
 Tell us where she is and we can get her safe. 
 We can make sure that she's okay. 
 Hannah pitched up at mine last week. 
 She'd fought with her mom. 
 Her mom was drunk. 
 We went back, but she wasn't there. 
 We didn't know what had happened. 
 So where is she now? 
 I can't. 
 You tell me where she is now or I will make sure that you never see her again. 
 Do you understand? 
 Tomellila. 
 A caravan by some greenhouses. 
 I was bringing her food. 
 I don't know where she'll be now. 
 She'll be worried to death. 
 Right, let's step up the alert for Hannah. 
 Search the area. 
 See if we can get roadblocks on the E65 and the 101. 
 And give Maja Hahne and Stefan Persson a call. 
 She might be in touch with them if she has nowhere else to go. 
 Yeah, Wallander. 
 Hi Kurt, it's Dr. OÖberg here. 
 Yeah. 
 I was wondering if you could come in. 
 Why? 
 I'd like to discuss your blood tests with you. 
 I'm just... I'm busy right now. 
 Sure. 
 So I'll have to give you a call, yeah? 
 Okay, Kurt. 
 Thanks. 
 Where are you heading? 
 Ystad. 
 Yeah, okay, jump in. 
 You can, um... 
 I know I said Ystad, but you can actually... 
 You can drop me off here at the corner. 
 It's fine, it's no trouble. 
 Hannah? 
 Hannah! 
 Hannah! 
 Hannah! 
 Hannah! 
 Hannah! 
 Hannah! 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Be careful. 
 Hannah, Hannah! 
 Hannah! 
 What's wrong with you? 
 What's wrong with you?! 
 Hannah, my name's Kurt, I'm a police officer. 
 No! 
 We know you were angry. 
 We know you were hurt. 
 It's all right, we know you didn't mean for it to happen. 
 I'm sorry. 
 She... 
 I didn't... 
 It's all right. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It's all right, come on. 
 Come on. 
 Where's Pontus? 
 He's safe, he's fine. 
 It's all right. 
 It's all right. 
 I was only trying to protect myself. 
 I wasn't actually going to kill anybody. 
 But she didn't believe me... 
 Yeah? 
 Kurt, I need you back at the station as soon as you can. 
 All right. 
 What's the problem? 
 Is this yours? 
 I don't... 
 You left it on a chair at a restaurant next to the E65. 
 I... 
 A little girl picked it up. 
 Her dad took it from her. 
 It was fully loaded. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Were you drunk? 
 No. 
 No... 
 I'm sorry, Kurt, I'm going to have to suspend you pending an internal affairs investigation. 
 I'm sorry. 
 So... 
 Well, Sweden was very beautiful. 
 Yeah. 
 But you will be coming to Riga soon, yes? 
 As soon as I can get some time off. 
 I'll try not to get lost on the way. 
 Bye. 
 (I love you.)
