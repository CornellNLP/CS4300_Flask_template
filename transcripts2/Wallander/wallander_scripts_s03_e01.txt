 This programme contains some strong language and some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting. 
 (Woman screams) 
 (Alarm sounds) Yes? Muster passengers and do a roll call. You go and see if there's any more people down there. Right. Please answer yes to your name, Lucas Johansson? Yes. (Shouting in latvian) We're not missing anyone. I think he's been drinking. Log it as a false alarm. OK. (Shouting continues) Sluchaj, sluchaj. Sluchaj, ona wciaz tam. Ej! (Dog barks) Jussi! Jussi! Come on! (Mobile phone tinkles) Phone! Yep, leave it. How many more? It's just there's another couple, that's all. Jussi, Jussi come on! Jussi! Hey. Oh, thanks. New start. (Mobile phone rings) How d'you fix the ringtones on those things? It suits you. Yeah, Wallander. Hi, Stefan. Kurt. Sorry, I know you're moving. It's OK. Down there. Right. What do you think? A ship's propeller? We logged it as a false alarm, 21:16, January 9th - last Wednesday. Yeah, and who reported that? A trucker. Czerwinski. One of our regulars, he comes back and forth with us most trips. He was drunk. You took a roll call? Standard procedure. Cut the engines, Wilson's turn, muster the passengers - 63 of them, mostly Poles, 78 staff. Nobody was missing. Stowaway? It's very hard to stow away these days. How far out were you? 12 nautical miles. Nearly home. And that's the right place for something to wash up where it did, yeah? Yeah, it's about right. This is round about where she would have been if... You have CCTV up here? We don't keep it. It's on a live feed. I think the Polish customs keep theirs for a couple of months. I can bring it over. We're back again tomorrow. That'll be great. I'll sort out authorisation. Yeah, thanks. Excuse me. I knew it! I said. You found her? Yeah, we found her. I heard a woman scream. Something drop, hit the side of the ship. Just there. I was here, she was just there. Let's get a photo of the bracelet into the papers and online. Someone will be missing her. You'd hope. Yeah, I'll see you later. Oh, congratulations on the house. Thank you. You OK? Yeah. Sure? There was a girl died and... she had this charm bracelet on. Lots of little teddy bears on it. It just... Come on, I'm improving. (She chuckles) As long as you don't fall asleep in the armchair with a bottle of wine any more, I'm happy. Another one? No. Thanks. (Dog whimpers) You better get that dog. Yeah. Yes, yes, I'm coming, I know, I know. Come on! (Dog barks) Jussi! Jussi, come on. Beach! (He whistles) Jussi! Jussi, what have you got there? What is it? Come here. Drop it. Drop it. Jussi, come here. Stay here, stay here. Come on, boy. Your dog's mixed everything up a fair bit. It's not a complete skeleton. Probably been a few animals over the years... Tell me it's Bronze Age, or plague, or something. It's a rifle. Sorry. Thought you were trying not to take your work home with you. Can you tell me about the previous occupants? Family from Estonia used to be here. They'd run away from the Russians. Ah, Fredrik. Kurt. Meant to drop by and say hello, but... Were they there for long? Couple of years. After that it's rentals mostly. Summer people. Don't stick my nose in. Do you know who it is? Thought you didn't stick your nose in. Didn't need to. Recognised you when you came up with your removals. OK. Seen you in the papers before. Sorry about all this. No. No, I'm sorry. Lucky, though, eh? You'll know how to deal with it, won't you? OK, yeah. That's fine, thank you. What have you got, Kristina? I've pulled up missing persons 1970 onwards. I thought anything earlier than that's historical interest. Have you got any idea of dates? The bone analysis'll take a few days. We should check out how old the blackcurrant bushes are. They must've been planted after she was buried. It is likely to be someone who lived here, the killer. You know this was quite a low-rent on this place before it was done up, so I think there were a lot of different tenants. Sure. We're all very sorry about this, Kurt. It's a great place. It's just an unfortunate coincidence. Lindeman's at the ferry terminal. The suicide, so... Sure. When... When you're ready. Sure. I'll just get changed. Yeah. Oh! Sorry! We'll all be out of your hair in a few hours. Yeah, yeah. I'm so sorry, Vanja. No, no, no, it's fine. No, it's all right, we'll sort it... Is Peter OK? God, are you kidding? He's loving all this! What are you looking for? Shirts? Yeah. Oh here, this? Yeah. That'll do. You think this is fate? Kurt, don't be so miserable! It's a coincidence, like Lennart says. Yeah, policemen aren't supposed to believe in coincidences. Excuse me, the staff office? It's just over there. Thanks. Hi, Stefan. Hi, Kurt. So this is Poland, the terminal, thought I'd count the passengers on and off. What time did you set sail on the ninth, please? 15.45. So, shall we start there and just go back? Go back. Slow down. Hold on, hold on. Stop. That's the bracelet. That's her. Do you have any more cameras on this? Yes, there's one in the waiting room, the file names are in Polish. Czekanie Sali. There she is! Oh, she was pregnant. Oh, no. That's us landing, disembarking at 11.40. There she is again. She must have come with us from Sweden. So she came over, she waited, and she came back again? There's no record of anyone doing that. Was she Polish do you think? Or Swedish? Who was she waiting for? Father of the child? He didn't turn up, she jumps on the way back. Yeah, do you jump when you're... What? Seven, eight months pregnant? I mean do you kill yourself? If she was Swedish, she'd have been referred to maternity hospital, so let's start there, yeah? Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Hi. Hello. Hi. How are you? And we should check the manifests as well. Sure. OK. I'll see you. Yeah. You all right? You're sure you're OK with this? Yeah. No problem. Right, lets do it then. So how did you find the place? One Sunday, we were taking Peter to his grandparents actually, I remember and there was... We saw the For Sale sign and it was... His whole life, he's wanted a place, with a dog, by the sea. A German Shepherd. The only real specification was that it had to be a German Shepherd. It's a black Labrador. I don't know, we'd been together a couple of years, and it's been... Oh, you know, taking it slowly. I've still got my flat though... for when its bad weather, or it's winter. You don't really need to know all this! I think this might have been in the machine all day. Thanks. Some of these don't fit the dates. The girl in your garden was about 20. She's been dead ten years or less. And the people who lived in the house? The woman who owned it before you was called Ekberg. She died last year. Always hired it out. Her solicitors are sending the rental documents down from Stockholm. Yeah. Where's Mum? Kurt... Oh, hi Peter, hang on... You don't need me any more tonight, do you? No, no you're fine. She's just down here. I thought when... it's sorted, we could plant up, you know, where's she been. Make it nice for her? Yeah, a bit late to make it nice for her. You know, this could have happened to anyone, Kurt. It could have happened to the couple from Bromolla who were bidding on it as well. Or the old lady who had it before. Yeah, but it didn't, it happened to me. Us. I'm going to rescue the pot plants. There's going to be a frost. Hold the dog. And you should brush your teeth. Why? All right then, don't brush your teeth. Kurt! (Bushes rustle and branch snaps) (She screams) (Dog barks) Mum? Peter, you stay there! KURT! Vanja? KURT! Vanja? Are you OK?! Yes! You're sure? Yes. Go on, go on! Armed police! I'm OK. I'm OK. Come here. (Birds' wings flap) (Gun cocks) Get out. NOW!! It's Kurt. Put the gun down, please. It's not loaded. There's a man. (Crashing) It was probably just a journalist or something, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Go and brush your teeth. I have. There's still half a hamburger stuck in there. Go on! You OK? It was him, wasn't it? So did you see anyone nearby? I would've said, don't you think? I'm not 100% thick. (Mobile phone rings) Sorry. Hoglund. (Electric drill roars) Yeah, hold on, I can't hear you. Hang on! Hey, he doesn't have to do that, I can do that. OK, there's no prints. Do you want me to do something about those birds? No, leave 'em alone. Just get finished and leave it as was, all right? Sorry. Coffee? Thanks. So was it him, do you think? Saw it in the papers, came back to check? No, I... Just some journo... Anyway, We're sorry we brought all this down on you. I know it's tough. No. How's the house? Ah, it's great. You've got a little lad, I see. He's not mine. I've got a grown-up daughter, Linda. You've got family I see in the pictures? She's dead. Boy and me don't talk. Not since his mother... They say girls are easier. Well, my girl doesn't talk to me either. Here. Think I've excavated most of the cat hairs. Thanks. Not been a great new start for you, has it? Kurt. Excuse me. The rent documents came. Your place has been unoccupied since 2007. A man called Jon Tavori hired it in 2006. Family called Petrus were there from 96 to 2005. Huh! Petrus? He was a crook, that one. Pervert. Thanks for this. How's Vanja doing? She's er... Well, I don't know actually. Better than me, probably. She thinks I should er... You know, leave things at the door a bit more. Stop carrying all this stuff around. She wants me to go to counselling. There's a confession for you. It's got a name, your house. Yeah? Black Heights. Oh, you're joking? Dunno. Seems pretty appropriate. I'm basically quite a cheerful person. (She laughs) What?! My promotion is through. Inspector. We're going to Gotland. Sanna and Henrik and me. Well, that's great. Well done! Most of the old team's broken up now anyway. Yeah. Yeah, well done. Look. You're going to speak to those people, aren't you? Do you mind if I come along? Hoglund, Ystad Police. John Tavori? Yeah? We'd like to know about a house on the Svarte Road that you rented in 2006. Old one with the courtyard? Didn't have it for long. What? What is it? Did you live there on your own? I'd had a nervous breakdown. Yeah. What did you do last night, Jon? Narcotics Anonymous. Malmo. Did you have any girlfriends up there at the time? It was a lonely house. Not a good place. OK, thanks. (Dogs bark) Jan Petrus? Yeah? Ystad Police. We understand you rented a house on the Svarte Road? Yeah. What do you want to ask about that place for? We're looking for a girl who might have been there. Gone missing. No girls there. Only these ones. How many daughters do you have? Can you count? There's Ellika as well. Who's she? Is she another daughter? She went to America. When was that? Years since. What d'you want to know that for? Do you have an address for her? Yeah. America. How many years since? Just after September 11th. We didn't want her to fly. But she did. Where were you last night, please? Here. Do you have a picture of Ellika? No. No photograph of your daughter? No. OK, thanks. Ellika? The Petrus family have three daughters. Two of them have active personal numbers, they're on the system. They both have vice arrests. The third one was born in 1980. She dropped off the radar in 2001. Yeah. When they were living at your place. Yeah, that's Ellika. Some outstanding court cases. Prostitution in Malmo. She didn't show. She's not been heard of since for nearly ten years. Ten years? She wasn't on the missing persons. Her family didn't report her missing. Who issued the... Who was in charge of the prostitution case? Sandin. Malmo vice unit. We know him. He says Jan Petrus fancied himself as a pimp. He went round the ports and stations, looking for runaways. If he got lucky, he'd run them as prostitutes until they moved on. He ran his own daughters. I'll talk to Lennart. Great, I'll want a copy of that. Well done, thanks. Sure. Yep? Lennart, have you got a minute? Hi, Stefan, how did you get on with the maternity clinics? Nowhere with the ones in town. I've sent an email of the photo to the others. We should check in Poland too. This is what they use for the roll call lists. The passengers fill them in, then they hand them in when they get on board, the crew make a register from them. Easiest thing in the world to lose a sheet of A4. Yeah, I suppose so. But with the computer records... Yeah, excuse me. Yeah? We don't have proper grounds for an arrest. We can ask him for a DNA sample, can't we? And he's going to say no, isn't he? Look, we need to establish whether Ellika is missing or if she's moved to the States like they say. If she has disappeared, then we can get an order and make the arrest. Right. I'm sorry, I know you just want to get this out of your world. No, it's OK. Thanks. Yeah, OK, good. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. There's no harm in going back and asking. Kurt, they're not here. Come on! Kurt! Kurt! Stay in the car, I'll be five minutes. Don't be patronising. Give us your hand. (Dog barks) Watch the dog. Yeah. It's chained up. There were two! Kurt! (Gun shots) Don't, Ann-Britt. Just go! Go! Go! Go! (Gun shots) No! OK, put it down, put it down. (She sobs) Are you all right? No! Drop it. Drop it! Drop it! Ann-Britt, come on. Come on, stay with me. Come on Ann-Britt, come on. Ambulance. 
 
 Do you want to talk? I came out to the hospital. You'd gone. I couldn't find you. Go on. (Mobile phone rings) Yeah? 'Hi Kurt, we've identified the girl from the ferry.' Yeah. She saw the photo of the charm bracelet in the papers. What's her name? The friend's called Snezna. The girl on the ferry was called Marinka Nowak. They're both Polish. And did you get any more on... Sorry. Are you sure you want to do this now? Yeah, yeah. This is everything, yeah? These are all her things? Yeah, this is her stuff. Everything. So, how well did you know her? We came across here from Krakow together and we've been friends for a long time. We were going to look after the baby together. Do you know why she'd gone over, why she'd went back home? She was going to Poland to get money, get some help. From the father? No, I don't know if from the father, but she said she was going to get us money and buy the baby things. Yeah, I understand. Was the father from Poland too, do you know? I don't know about the father, she wouldn't tell me, she kept him secret. I know she liked him very much. But it went wrong. He made her sad. Do you know where she might have met him? She met him at work. What kind of work did you um...? What kind of work do you think? I don't think she would've killed herself. Not with the baby. Where did you get the bracelet from? We bought for each other at Christmas. Look she wouldn't keep me waiting for her to come back. We had plans. What are you going to do? Hmm? We'll, we, er... What are you going to do with her body? When is her funeral? Recording of child singing : ♪ Incy Wincy spider went up the water spout ♪ 
♪ Down came the rain and washed the spider out ♪ 
♪ Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain... ♪ Are you family. Colleague. (Turns off recording) You don't have to. Talk to her if you like, sit with her. It does some good. ♪ Incy Wincy spider climbed up the water spout ♪ 
♪ Down came the rain and washed the spider out ♪ 
♪ Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain... ♪ What happened to Ellika? Your youngest daughter? The girl you used to run as a prostitute? She went to the States. Florida. There's no record of her in Florida. You're a liar, we know you killed her in 2001. Ellika can look after herself. She never let me lay a finger on her. I think you shot her, I think you buried her in your garden because you're a violent man. That bitch shot my dogs. Do you know what you've done? Do you understand? She's got a little daughter! A seven-year-old girl. f*cking destroyed her! You piece of sh1t! She's going to live. It won't be murder. Why don't you tell us about Ellika, make a clean breast of it? Co-operate? Talk to my wife. 'Ellika lives in Arizona.' Your husband said it was Florida. He wouldn't know. He hasn't spoken to her since she went. I've been out to see her. What airport did you fly to? What's the name of the airport in Arizona? Ellika's fine. There's a body under the blackcurrant bushes in the garden of the house where you lived. There weren't any blackcurrants. Kurt! Grand Canyon 2008. That's her. No, it could be anybody. Kurt! Yeah. Look for a hairbrush, anything that we can get DNA from. Kurt! We arrested Petrus for the assault on Ann-Britt. We're not authorised to take DNA evidence for that. If you take it without proper permission, it's not admissible. If there's nothing in this, if this isn't the man who killed the girl in my garden, then this whole thing is a stupid, pointless...! (Car engine starts) What do you think? Could be. Could well be. Take a look at this, will you? What's this? Just for DNA. I got it from here. Please, throw it away. It won't be admissible, Kurt. It'll affect the other case. It'll affect Ann-Britt. Just go home, eh? Yeah. (Level crossing bell rings) Oh, not now! Hi, Fredrik. I saw it in the paper, about your... Is she all right? No. Ah. That's terrible. I'm sorry. Sorry, I can't really... Sorry. (Mobile phone rings) 'Good news, you found the murder weapon.' Right. 'The rifle's the one that shot the girl in your garden.' Good. That's great, thank you, thank you. Thanks. (Mobile phone rings) Yeah, Wallander. Woman : 'The detective?' Yeah. Who's this? 'My name's Ellika Petrus. 'I'm alive. I'm in the States. My dad's not a good man, but he's not a murderer.' I need... (Phone hangs up) Hello? Hello? (Woman groans) (Punches land) (Woman gasps and cries out) (Struggle continues) (She cries out) Ellika Petrus is alive. She's living in Phoenix, Arizona. She's got a vice record there as well. It checks. We know the girl in my garden was killed with Petrus's gun. She could be one of his prostitutes. We should cross-reference missing persons and vice arrests for that time. Ellika was picked up by the Vice Unit in Malmo, maybe the others were too. I've done that. Nothing. OK. We need to talk to her, can you arrange a phone call? Sure. Who was she? It wasn't Ellika, right? You got that wrong, didn't you? Wasn't my daughter. Not mine. We know that you used to drive around, looking for lost little girls. You used to see one, you used to take them home, have s*x with them, then try to turn them, so they might make money for you. I don't know any girls like that. Then you shot her with your rifle. I think you buried her in your garden, let weeds grow over her body. You're dreaming. Yeah. You know you're dreaming. Who was she? You've got nothing. I didn't do it in the first place and you can't prove that I did. Nothing. And as for the other thing, the police... bitch. She WAS trespassing. She shot my dogs. She shot my dogs. I'll get six months maximum for that. Water off a duck's back to me. This is Helena Ahlquist. She walked out to get the bus into Gothenburg in 2006, never been seen since. Do you recognise them? Why would I? Look at them. I am. This is a body, same age, same s*x, was found buried underneath the blackcurrant bushes in what used to be your garden. There weren't any blackcurrant bushes. Eva, you knew something. You must have some idea who this could have been, cos it could have been one of your daughters. Who is it? Kurt? Hang on! No, Kurt. We've got a body. Is this a coincidence? There's no such thing as coincidence. We need to get back to that ferry. We're ready to go. I can't hold the ship up. Those are the rosters. It's the same crew today as it was when she... Right, we'll talk to them all together first, and then we'll see them one by one. You'll have to work it around their duties. Is there any way that staff could tamper with the passenger lists? Delete names? No. No, it's impossible. You sure? Yes. Where can we meet them please? The bar, level 5, is fine. Thank you. We want to talk to all of you about two girls. One of whom, Snezna Botez, was killed last night in Ystad, when this ferry was in port. Her friend, Marinka Nowak, boarded this ship on the January 9th. She travelled to Poland, she waited in the terminal there, she came back. Somewhere over the Baltic on that journey, she fell from the ship. Or she was pushed. She had some reason for being on this ferry and for waiting in Poland. And the records of her being here are missing. We'll both be talking to you individually, thank you for your time. January 9th, do you remember seeing this girl? No, I don't think so. I understand that you work in the bar? Occasionally. Do you think you'd remember if she'd asked for a drink? Yeah, I would've thought so. I don't know, there's a lot of these kind of girls coming out from the East. Too many of them. Maybe she was.. Maybe she was what? Maybe round the muster station, maybe. Maybe not. Could you have seen her with anyone? Had you seen her before? No. Can I ask you, can you access the passenger lists from these terminals? Yeah. Do you mind showing us? Yeah, we need it for the duty free. How does that work? Well, it's open so we can enter in the purchase details, there's staff terminals all around. So you could alter it? Yes, easily. You can just get into it like this. It's a joke. OK, thanks. Can you operate the staff terminals, the computers, here? I don't need to. Do you recognise her? I don't know her. Recognise either of them? Pretty girls, though. You push her friend off the ferry? Come on! All right, that's all, thanks. Right. Next. (Horn blasts) I'm going to go down and talk to the Polish police, get that working. Do you want to take prints on the way back? Yeah, it can't hurt. Do you reckon we're going to get anyone for this? Any of this? Yes. I do. Good. (Mobile phone beeps) Answerphone : 'You have two new messages. New messages.' (Phone beeps) Vanja : 'Kurt, it's me, it's after midnight. I hope you're OK.' (Phone beeps) Answerphone : 'Next message.' 'This is Thure Bergsson. I'm Jan Petrus's attorney. 'Please call me back. 'I'd like to discuss the charges with you as soon as we can.' Kurt. Hi. All OK? Yeah, yeah. Look, there's a pay phone near where Marinka would have gone out on deck. Maybe she rang someone, there's no mobile signal at sea. Maybe she would have called someone. So let's check the call records. Worth a try. Yeah. OK. Wallander? Yeah? Hi. I'm Jan Petrus's attorney. Did you get my message? Yes, we're going to be charging your client with attempted murder. Nobody'll prosecute that. Really? I'll make a start tracing those phone records. Yeah, yeah. And on the police officer, Hoglund. Yeah, Ann-Britt. 30. She's in a coma. I've just spoken to her doctors. They say she'll recover. It's bodily harm at worst. Now, I realise this must be tough for you. Very tough. I've spoken to Ellika Petrus this morning in Phoenix and she's willing to talk to you, provided you... take a view on the charges against her father. Talk about what? She says she knows who the victim is and that she thinks she might know the man who did it. Mr Bergsson... Good to see you. Kurt. Where have you been? I've, I, I had to go to Poland. Could you have called? You disappear off the map for a day and a night. Have you had something to eat? I've got to go. I'm sorry. It's just, I can't believe it didn't occur to you to phone. I'm sorry. It's very comfortable, isn't it? Putting on your old clothes. No, it's not. I've got to go. We'll talk about this later. When you were living at that house, was there anything at the back of the garden? What kind of thing? Fruit bushes? Blackcurrant bushes? I don't know anything about plants. Understood, but just try and picture. Was there anything on the border between the garden and the farmland? There was a flood there in 2006. Killed off pretty much everything. You could see straight up to the trees. There was nothing, nothing growing. Right. Thanks. The blackcurrant bushes weren't there when I bought the place. Somebody dumped the body after I bought it! They dumped it with the blackcurrant bush for me to find it. Who would dump a body in your garden? Doesn't make sense. I don't see that it's personal. The body's connected to the house. She was shot with a gun that belonged to the man that lived there at the time. Either way, either way, Ellika says she knows who the girl was. If she knows anything at all, we have to agree terms with the lawyer. We'll have to bail the father anyway. So, er... When's Ellika Petrus calling? 2pm her time. That's all right. She can call me at home at the house. Yeah. Hi. It's pretty much ready. Yeah, I can't have it right now. Sorry. Half an hour? Have you got a pen? Thing is, I don't know what's going to happen with this. Don't bother about me, you have it yourselves and I'll... I can wait. I'm not that hungry. (Phone rings) Yep, Wallander. 'This is Ellika Petrus.' Peter! I can warm it up for you later if you... Sssh! Sssh! 'The girl was called Lina. She was from Norrland.' Did she have a last name? 'Not that we knew. She came down on one of the logging wagons, far as we could work out, from the North. Dad picked her up when she was floating around the hostels in Malmo. He brought her home. I, I'm not doing this for my father. I'm doing it for my mum.' Did he send her out to make money? Like he did with... '..She wouldn't go. He let her stay as a nanny. She was good with the babies and the dogs. We all went away for a weekend, one autumn. Just before I left. Lina stayed to look after the dogs. When we came home, she'd gone. Thought she'd gone home.' Who do you think killed her? 'She was involved with someone. He'd got her pregnant. He was married, I think. I can't remember the name. But he lived on the next farm. Dad didn't like the man there. She used to sneak out, nights. The guy on the next farm, he was a creep. Always bothering the girls. Hello? Are you still there?' Kurt? (Door slams) (Car engine starts) Fredrik? Fredrik? That's where she's been, all these years. Just there. What was her name? Lina. Lina what? I don't know. Never did. She's just been there. I planted the blackcurrants over her for remembrance. Thought it was time she was she was dealt with. By me? Seemed like fate. Fate? Fate!? I just couldn't stand looking at her little grave any more. Neither of us could. My wife hanged herself, Kurt. She knew? She just wanted to go on about it. Bring it back up. What did she used to go on about? About how you'd killed Lina? It was an argument. Over at your place. Petrus was away. His gun went off. Accident! I never thought it could happen again. (Happen again?) What are you talking about, "happen again"? Fredrik, what do you mean, "happen again"? I just thought I'd put it right. Not in the right way of course, but, the best way I could. I'm sorry. Who was that man I chased into the house? Why did he run in here? Who was he, Fredrik? I don't know. How old were you when Lina died? 55. She was 20. You made her pregnant? (Pregnant?) Didn't you know that she was pregnant? (Phone rings) Coffee? (Phone continues to ring) (Gunshot) (Crashing) (Phone continues ringing) (Phone rings) Hello? 'Hello. This is Detective Officer Stefan Lindeman. 'I'm calling from Ystad Police. To whom am I speaking?' What the hell are you talking about? 'This is Stefan Lindeman, from Ystad Police.' Yeah, and this and this is Kurt Bloody Wallander. 'Kurt? 'Where are you? 'I'm going through the numbers from the phone on the ferry. 'This number was called from the ferry at 9.27pm on 9th January. 'Where are you?' I'll call you back. Stefan? I need you to give me the name and address of my neighbour's son. Jorgen Thorson. He works on the ferry. (Doorbell rings) Yes? Your husband at home? He'll be sailing now. Where, to Poland? On his way back. I want to talk to him about his father. He doesn't speak to his father. Not since his Mum... His father killed himself today, too. Your husband spoke to him the other night. He called his father from the ferry. He begged him for help because he was in serious trouble. His father said enough was enough. You know what I'm talking about? (Phone rings) That'll be him. He always calls when he gets in range. Don't answer it! We have reason to believe your husband has killed at least one young woman. Probably more. Don't answer the phone, don't warn him.

I realise I can't expect anyone to be patient enough with... I'm really sorry, but... It's OK. We're not making any decisions here. We're just trying to solve problems.
