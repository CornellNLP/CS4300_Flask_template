 (Man screams, birds caw) ♪ Tram wires ♪

♪ Down the tattered street ♪ 
♪ On a door that shouldn't be ♪ 
♪ In front of me. ♪ Hey, Dad. (He looks dreadful.) I'm not deaf. How would you know how I look, anyway? You haven't been here for weeks. A few days, Dad. Weeks. Where are you going? I thought you might want to talk to Kurt. No, don't leave me. Gertrude! I'll just be outside. No, no. Here, here. No, stay, sit. Please. So, how are you, Dad? Useless. Can't... Can't think. Can't see. (Povel sighs) Take me home. Home? Well, I can't die here. Meaning... all meaning ending here? Take me home. Do you want to go to the studio? No. Finished. Just want to sit. You don't look, do you? You don't look at the world. You just drive straight through it. Stop, and look. Go on, off you go. I'll be all right now. I'll sit with him. Find someone to sit with you. You're not strong enough to do it on your own. Nobody is. Find someone to sit with you. (Car horn toots) If we can't control the parking outside our own bloody station, what's the point? The driver thinks he may have a missing person for us. Holger Eriksson. He's always there when I make my delivery. Never missed. Maybe he forgot. Tried twice since. Nothing. The office called. Answer machine. He's away, then. Then I tried again this morning. No answer. So I tried the door. It was open. Well, did you go in? Of course I didn't go in. That's your job. I move oil. That's mine. OK, thanks. (He murmurs) No, Kurt. I can't. I've got to finish that profile for Lisa. Where's Anne-Britt? At the florist's in town. Possible burglary. Can you tell stuff, then? By looking round? Er, best to stay here. He's a bird-watcher. A bit of a twitcher. Writes poems about them. He's got a tower in the woods. Reaches up into the trees so he can be among them, he says. OK. Thanks. Don't you need to...move some oil? (He scoffs) (Birds caw) (Bird caws) (Birds caw) I think it's called a punji pit. Vietcong used to use them. They cropped up again recently in the Congo. Bamboo stakes sharpened to a point, then banged in with a mallet. Basic but effective. What about these planks? Oh, the supports have been sawn through. Wouldn't have taken much. Most of them were rotten anyway. How long do you think he's been there? A few days at least. And I don't think he'd have died immediately. The wounds suggest he struggled. There are tears. The pain must have been unimaginable. (Dog barks in distance) (Whimpering) (He whimpers) (He mouths) (Door shuts, key turns) Yeah, got it. All right. Thanks. That was Anne-Britt. She wants you to meet her at the florist's. The florist's? What, now? There's nothing stolen, but there are bloodstains on the floor. OK, OK. What is it? Guy who runs this place is away. Gosta Runfeldt. Been gone two-and-a-half weeks. Meant to have gone to Africa - orchid safari. Orchid safari? He gave his staff three weeks off. His manager came in to start preparing to re-open next week. Discovered the break-in, but... Nothing's missing. Vanja Andersson. The manager. Er, Kurt Wallander. Er, you're sure nothing's been taken? There's a bit of stock in the cold store and everything else had been sold. Magnus said something about bloodstains. Orchids. We specialise. They're beautiful. This... This room was locked up, presumably? When does he get back? The owner. Runfeldt. That's just it. I called the travel company to see when his flight was due back. They said he never made the trip. Didn't get on the plane. No sign of him. For two-and-a-half weeks? Have you tried calling him? His mobile's switched off and there's no reply from his apartment. Right. Well, we'd better get forensics down here. And where is his apartment? We should check that out. Upstairs. I can do that, Kurt. Well, I'm here now. He's crazy about them. His wife. She was killed in an accident a couple of years ago. There's a couple of grown-up children. Well, it looks as if he set off for somewhere. Profile. Holger Eriksson. Car dealer. Retired 15 years ago. He had four showrooms at one point. So, money. It looks like it. Plenty of enemies, too, I imagine. Car dealer? Are you kidding? But there's no sign of a robbery. This wasn't about money. This man was meant to suffer and it was meant to shock. I'll make a detailed search of his business contacts. Yeah. And we need the time of death, soon as we can. They're working on it. We need someone down at the florist's. I want a report on that stockroom. (Mobile phone rings) But it wouldn't surprise me if the florist guy hasn't just done a bit of a swerve. Peaceful break somewhere where nobody can find him. Not the worst idea. ..Yeah, Gertrude. 'Your father's gone.' Sorry, he's...he's gone where? 'Povel's dead.' Er...well...he can't be. I... I...I don't understand. We... He just got home. How... How can... Where is he? 'He's in the studio. I went to check...' What's he doing in the studio? He said that he didn't...want... I... Have you... Have you called an ambulance? 'I thought I should speak to you first.' I mean, how do you know? How do you know?! 'Kurt...Kurt, please...' Just... No, wait there. Just... 'Just listen to me.' Just wait. Wait! Dad? Dad. Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad...Dad, Dad... Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! (Kurt breathes heavily) I'll, er... I'll...I'll call the ambulance. Do you want to stay here tonight? I mean, un...unless you want... No, I'll...I'll be fine. (Door closes) (Panting) (Choking) (Birdsong) (Mobile phone rings) 'Kurt, it's Magnus. We found another body.' (Chatter over police radio) Jogger found him. You OK? It's the florist. Get Nyberg out here. And Vanja. The florist manager. She'll need to ID him. This is Gosta Runfeldt. If you'll just come this way. Kurt? Oh, hello, sorry. I know this is...a bit out of order, but our forensics team are really stretched and we need to get a positive ID as soon as possible, so... We could wait until we get him to the morgue... It's OK. All right. Thank you very much. If you'd like to come with me. We'll try and make this quick. Maybe just... If we just stand here, perhaps. All right, thank you. Thank you for your help. Thank you, thank you. That's not, er... It's not easy, I know. I... I've... I've never seen a... dead body before. A dead body's just a dead body. It's not a person, it's a corpse. To you, maybe. What... What's happened to him? Really, we don't know yet. He looks so much thinner. Thinner? His face. The stubble...beard...maybe. But this is important. Do you think that he's lost weight? Looks like it. Held somewhere? He's been missing for nearly three weeks. That's more than enough to lose weight noticeably. Fingernails were ingrained with dirt, filth and urine on his underclothes. Why hold him? There have been no ransom demands or anything. I don't know. But you... you think he was alive when he was tied to the tree. Definitely. He was tied to the tree and then strangled. There are small abrasions to the back of his head where he struggled, and we found traces of blood on the tree. And you think there's a connection? With Eriksson? They're both like public executions, aren't they? They're premeditated, planned. And neither of them died instantly. Torture. I think there must be something that these men have in common. I don't know. I mean, did they do business together? Did Runfeldt... buy cars from Eriksson, maybe? Something to do with the orchids? Or the birds? Check it out. Or maybe there was some society they belonged to. I don't care how small it is, but there's something that we're not, um... oh, er... seeing...yet. Oh, OK, thanks. (Breathes heavily) Kurt, are you sure you're OK? Yeah, fine. Look, if you're not up to this, you've just got to say. Look, I can bring someone in to cover. This is your father, Kurt. No-one's going to... He was an old man. It's what happens. He burnt a lot of them. I'll take one with a grouse. (Mobile phone rings) (He yawns) (Ringing stops) Bo Runfeldt. Kurt Wallander. Breakfast? I came down last night after I'd been informed. Apologies for the early start, but I've got a lot to get through, as I'm sure you can imagine. I've already been down to my father's shop. I...I realise, er, how difficult this must be for you. The circumstances of my father's death... appear to have been horrific. The fact of his death is, I'm afraid... (Laughs mirthlessly) ..rather less affecting. My sister and I rarely spoke to him. Not since our mother committed suicide. My mother slit both her wrists, lay down in a warm bath and died. I found her. And... And you hold your father responsible? Entirely. He was an abusive bully. But he was your father. Don't you feel anything? Relief. I know you've spoken to Vanja. I imagine she can fill you in with anything you need to know. She knew my father as well as anyone. They were lovers. Now, if you'll forgive me, I've got a lot to get through today. Is there any paperwork you need me to attend to? I... Er... We'll be in touch if... if there is. Why didn't... Why didn't you tell me? It was two years ago. What was the point? Every point. But you...you carried on working for him, so were...were you still friends? He wasn't an easy man. His son must have told you. Yeah, about the mother. I started...working for him and I just fell into it. Was he...violent? Sometimes. Er...I just used to... go away for a few days. But you went back. So why...why did you keep working for him? It suited me. I have a young boy. Gosta paid well. He left me alone... most of the time. Most of the time. How do you feel...now? Now that this has happened? Honestly? Like a great weight has been lifted. Have... Have you ever heard of a man called Holger Eriksson? No. Why? Thank you for doing this. I appreciate it. Er, do you want me to take those? Yeah. What do I have... Actually, it's OK. I'll...start with the right. Just take your thumb. Press it nice and hard. Just for the purposes of elimination. That's perfect. That's lovely. Press. Right, press. Does she have an alibi? Of course she doesn't. How can you have an alibi for three weeks? And she's never heard of Eriksson. Well, she said. Maybe Runfeldt and Eriksson are not connected. I bet they are. Have we got nothing on Eriksson yet? No, nothing on record. No wife. No family. We're trying to track down some of his old staff, but... Well, what about the...oil guy? Tyren. He's being a bit difficult. He was a good man. A right-thinking man. So you got to know him? We talked. About what? The world. The country. What's left of it. You should've heard him go. He'd get angry? You'd get him off on one. Like a shadow had come across him. Then he'd smile, laugh it off, pot of coffee and back on to his birds. No wife? (He scoffs) No... No women? He didn't keep them in the house. Meaning? Said he used to nip over to Poland when he felt the need. Cheap and cheerful and it made for a nice trip. Like I say, a right-thinking man. Why haven't we got anything on Eriksson yet? And I want Nyberg's report on that blood down at the florist's. What the hell is everybody doing? Got to pick up Linda, I'm going to be late... Always bloody late. Kurt. Give yourself a break. It's your dad. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Hi, Dad. Hello, Kurt. I'm so sorry. Hi, Inga. I...didn't realise you were...er... I wanted Mum to come. I wanted to be here. The car's just here. (Train horn blares) (Bells toll) Are you OK? Er... Yeah. Everything's, um... Everything working out? Yes, it's...working out fine. Why do you still wear it, Kurt? I don't know. I just never... I'm... I'm happy now. I've got a good life. It's still possible, you know. Sure, sure. We can't go back, Kurt. It's just never going to happen. We should get on the train... Yeah. Yeah. Dad. Gertrude says she'll give us a lift to the station. It's on her way and we're running a bit late. Is that OK? Yeah, yeah. You can always call. Thanks. Do you want anything of Granddad's, as we'll be clearing the house? I've got what I want. Some of his poems. He gave them to me last time I saw him. Poems? Yeah, they're handwritten. Some of them are really beautiful. I didn't know he wrote poetry. Yeah, we'd swap sometimes. You show me yours, I'll show you mine. You never showed me your poetry. I didn't think you'd be interested. Linda! Yeah, coming. Is that why he didn't show me? What? His poetry. He didn't think I'd be interested? He didn't think that was the kind of...inner life you had. "Inner life"? You talked about my "inner life"? He worried about you, Dad. What, about my "inner life"? No. That was my word. Well, what was his? Your soul. He worried about your soul. Bye, Dad. (Mobile phone rings) Thought we should wait until you got here. Get Nyberg out here. And get Vanja Andersson down to the station. Make sure you get it all in. I have. From above. I am above. Straight down! You're still at an angle. (Magnus sighs) Well, don't put your foot on the bloody thing. I'm not. Oh, hello. Come in, please. A forensic, er, picture. Did they tell you about the...the suitcase? We'd just like you to confirm that it's Runfeldt's. Perhaps you could say if you recognise the clothes. Um, can I...? Sure. These are definitely his. I know this stuff. It's odd, though. What is? Well, the... way this stuff has been folded. It's not like him. Why? It's too neat. He was always in a hurry. You mean you don't think he packed that case? And there's a faint smell, as well. Kind of perfume. It's not like him, either. Can't you smell it? Did he have a woman? Not for ages. OK, thanks. Is that it? For now. We'll call if there's any news. What do you think? I think that case was packed, or re-packed, by a woman. 
 
 (Woman screams) You're doing well. One more of those. One more of those. You've been a good girl. Come on, breathe. Good girl, good girl. Come on, come on. You're doing so well. Wait! Stop! Wait! Wait! We were meant to find this, I'm sure of that. It was just off the main road. Open country. And you can't tell how long it'd been there? Not specifically. But definitely not overnight. OK. Planted after Runfeldt's death, deliberately. So, it's telling us something. She's telling us something. That she's a woman. Are you sure about Vanja Andersson? She doesn't have any connection with Eriksson. That we know of yet. Do you think she could have dug a pit, made a trap, kidnapped the man, held him captive, dragged him to a public park? Strangled him with her bare hands? Well, maybe she's not alone. She'd have to have ice for blood to behave the way she's behaving. That was a call from the hospital. They've got a suspected intruder in the maternity ward who's laid out one of the midwives. Oh, just...deal with it, Magnus, please. Christ, that is all we bloody need. Have you questioned her - Vanja? Have you questioned her? I've spoken to her about Runfeldt, yes. We've taken her prints, yes, there are no matches. She is not the woman we're looking for. I hope not, Kurt. Let's run through all this again. No. Let's leave it. There's nothing more we can do tonight. There's something that we're not reading. No, Kurt. That's enough. You need to get some rest. And I've got to put the kids to bed tonight. I should've been out of here an hour and a half ago. Look. Nyberg's coming round for something to eat later. Why don't you come over? She does this fantastic boiled fish thing. (He laughs) Does she? You shouldn't be alone tonight. I'll be fine. I just need to...think about this. Night, then. You sure you're OK? Yeah. Yeah, go on. (Door opens) (Men chatter) (Showers start) Can I have a coffee, please? One coffee coming up. Ta. (Gasping) Are you OK? (Muffled cries) (He gasps) Ohh... (He gasps and splutters) Be a shame to lose this place. Why? It stinks of death, like everywhere else. I'm going to get a dog. A dog? Yeah. New house. Bit of land, maybe. Dog. What kind of a dog? That was the last thing he said to me. "Find someone to sit with you." (Thunder rumbles) He didn't mean a dog. I know. Good night, Kurt. (Door closes) 'Hi. It's Vanja. 'I can't take your call right now, but please...' (Mobile phone vibrates) Hello. Drowned. Can't find any other marks on him at the moment. Do we know who he is? No. Anne-Britt's checking to see if we had any overnight missing persons. The bag had been packed with rocks. Just enough to make it sink. Slowly. Slowly? I'm fairly certain he was alive when the bag was submerged. I think it may have been dropped from the end of the jetty. The bag had definitely been left open. Like this, to reveal his face. So he could have been looking directly at the killer? As he went down. Exactly. This is our man again. Or our woman. It's a heavy bag. Adela Blomberg. Reported her husband missing after going on his run last night. Lives on the other side of the lake. I know this must all come as an appalling...shock, but I do have to...ask some questions, if you wouldn't mind. You say your husband left the house at about ten, for his run? He runs late. Says it helps him sleep. But you didn't report him missing until first thing this morning. Eugen and I have separate bedrooms. After he left last night, I went to bed. I didn't notice anything was amiss until breakfast this morning. Your husband is a successful businessman, I believe. He worked for an international milling company. He was abroad much of the time. Do you know if he had any...difficult business dealings lately? Arguments? You want to know who might have killed my husband? I might have. Or the 50 other women he's betrayed and bullied and lied to over the last 20 years. He threatened that if I ever left him... he'd see to it that I didn't get a penny. And he could do that. He could tie up any deal he wanted. So, I live my life and I look after him... whilst he chases after anyone who takes his fancy. I didn't think I could feel anything any more. But I do now. Now that he's gone. I feel glad. It's the same pattern. Abuse. Whoever's doing these killings is on a mission. Anne-Britt : The revenge of the abused women. Lisa : Well, could they all have been in on it? Orchestrated it in some way? Magnus : Like Murder On The Orient Express? Nyberg : Except that was one victim and lots of killers. You're thinking of Ten Little Indians, aren't you? Magnus : Am I? You know, the one with... Albert Finney on the train. Lisa : No, that's Murder On The Orient Express. Can we just concentrate, for God's sake?! People are dying! Doesn't anybody get that? People are dead! Kurt. Where are you going? I still think Eriksson is the key. He was the first. We haven't found his crime yet. His abuse. Maybe it would be better all round if you took the rest of the day off. Go home. "For Krista". (Birds caw) Adela blomberg : These were on his laptop. I was checking his mail to see who I should inform. That's the most recent. Katarina. There's no surname. She was obviously his latest. And she's pregnant. From what I've read, he wanted her to have an abortion. She refused. She's telling him she's about to give birth. We're going to need this computer, I'm afraid. We have to trace this woman. We can get a warrant, or... Take it! Get it out of my house. I need you to drop whatever else you're doing and find out who that woman is. Right. Take the bloody thing away. I don't want it here, do I? There's something that we're missing. Something niggling away at me. Did you go back to Eriksson's place? Eriksson, did you go back? Yeah, yeah. I had a look. There was a series of these. Look, it's his nature poetry. But each of them is dedicated to the same woman. Krista. Last one eight years ago. Krista? What, no surname? Yeah, it might be nothing, but I just... I can't work out why HE would have them. If he dedicated them to her in his own hand, wouldn't he have given them to her? She left him? Maybe she died? I think whoever dug that pit watched Eriksson fall into it from the tower. So get Nyberg to send somebody out there to dust for prints. Have we got any of Eriksson's old staff yet? Magnus was on that. Oh, God. How long does he need? Eriksson retired. The business has changed hands three times since. OK, OK... Kurt, Katarina Taxell. Piece of piss. I got hold of the server and... OK, fine. Address? Where do I find her? Police! Come on, open up! (Dog barks) Police! We heard! I'm looking for Katarina Taxell. She went off to have the baby. Three days ago. Where? Do you know? Hospital. Which hospital? I don't know. It didn't say on the ambulance! Yeah, Magnus? Yeah, she's not here. We need to get onto the hospitals now. Katarina Taxell had her baby last night. Left here this morning. That's all they'd give me over the phone. It's weird, though. What is? It was the same midwife who got assaulted by that intruder, remember? Did Katarina have any other visitors? Just her mother. They had a row. They were always bickering. So, did she leave here on her own? I think so. I wasn't on duty when she went. Who was? Maria Garsson. Check out Garsson. Tell me about the intruder, the woman who hit you. I gave your colleague a statement. I know, Ylva, but I'd like you to tell me. Um...it was during Katarina's birth. Right. I saw a woman. Here? Yeah. She saw me. She headed off up the corridor. I ran after her and when I got to her, she turned round and hit me. So, can you describe her? I only really saw her from behind. Long hair, I remember that. Long, blonde hair. You didn't see her face when she was looking in? No, the corridor was a bit dark. Katarina WAS picked up... by a woman. Dark, short, cropped hair. Thank you. Thank you for coming. I've got a brief statement. I won't be taking questions. Fresh evidence has come to light regarding the murders of Holger Eriksson, Gosta Runfeldt and Eugen Blomberg. We're now as certain as we can be that these killings are linked. We need to get in touch with this woman. Her name is Katarina Taxell. She's 20 years old and yesterday, she gave birth to a boy in Lund hospital. 'Anyone who has seen this woman or who knows this woman should contact their local police immediately.' (Phone rings) 'You'll have copies of the statement. That's all we have time for. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you very...' Wallander. 'It's Vanja Andersson. I know that woman. Katarina. I know her.' (Baby cries) (Doorbell rings) Hi. Come in. We should be quiet. My son's a light sleeper. I don't have any drink. Would you like some tea? Yes. I'd love some. A women's group? What kind of women's group? It was for women who were having a bad time. You know, husbands, fathers, boyfriends... Abuse. Dysfunctional relationships. We never liked to call it abuse. It was when I was having a bad time with Gosta. Um... I only ever saw the other women at the group. First names only. And you could just pour it out, you know? It helped. And Katarina? Mmm. She was already part of it when I joined. She'd had a history of bad relationships. Older men. Married men. Who else was in this group? This is really important. It varied. Three or four. I think we got up to seven at one point. But it was mostly five of us. Was there a tallish woman - short, dark, cropped hair? Yvonne? Yvonne? Yvonne who? She ran it. I never knew her surname. So tell me about her. Did she take part? Did she just listen? No. She took part. Her father died when she was younger. Her mother took up with another guy. He was abusive. To both of them. Eventually, they just ran away, left the country. Then a few years ago, her mum got cancer. Wanted to end her days back in Sweden. Yvonne brought her home. She was nursing her. She wasn't having a great time, but she wasn't going to let her mum go into a home or anything. I guess they'd been through so much together. (She sighs) That's about it, really. You think... she's got something to do with these murders? There's two men killed who were involved with women in the same group and we're fairly sure that we're looking for somebody who fits her description. I can't believe it. And you don't know who the other women were? Any of them? Only Christian names. You... You don't have a pen and paper, do you? Are you OK? The painting. Came with the apartment. I think it's an old reprint. It gets nearer the door every time I move it. That's not a reprint. He did hundreds of them. Thousands, maybe. All the same...landscape. Some with a grouse, like yours, but some not. That's...what he said our...lives were. We each have our own...landscape. That's what we...we had to endure. Who was he? It never occurred to me to take it seriously. No. No, nor me. The mother's dead. Yvonne. And that's what's triggered this. Her mother's died. That's what this madness is. You called before, didn't you? Last night. I had a missed call. I recognised the number when it came up earlier. I, um... Yeah. I'm sorry. Why? Oh... I'm afraid I was a bit... a bit confused. My, er... My dad... just died a couple of days ago. I'm very sorry. It was very unprofessional, but I just, er... Peter. What are you doing? I woke up. Peter, come and say hello. That was me talking, I expect. Sorry. I'm Kurt. Hello. My name's Peter. Hello, Peter. Come on, bed. I'll let myself out. You can call again, if you want to. Come on. Get warm. Snuggle down. Morning. Thank you. Thank you. They met at a community hall in Angaskolen. Caretaker remembers Yvonne, but no surname. Always paid in cash. Should we get Vanja in for an identikit? Get it out as soon as possible. We've had hundreds of calls about Katarina. We need to check every one. Vanja's given me a list of the other women's Christian names. One of them may call. Check every call. This woman is going to kill again. We need to get there before she does. (Mobile phone rings) Yes, Anne? I've found an old foreman who worked at one of Eriksson's garages. Finally. Where? 'Preskragen Nursing Home. Do you know where that is?' Yeah... Yeah, I know where that is. OK. Eriksson was a b*st*rd. Hard. Mean. You said earlier you remembered a woman. His woman. He had a few. Kept them to himself. He wouldn't see them at the garages. He kept them at home. But you met them? I used to get summoned to the house. Management. Every few months. Pep talk. Krista. Do you remember a woman called Krista? The Polish Beauty. That's what we called her. Polish? Lovely woman. She lasted the longest. Then, one day, she was gone. I never saw her again. And you didn't ask. Not with Eriksson. Was there a daughter? Do you remember a daughter? Not his. He never had a daughter. It was hers. Her daughter. You remember? Willowy girl. Lovely smile. What was her name? Can you remember her name? Yvonne? Was it Yvonne? Yvonne. That's it. Good, good, good. Willowy girl. Great. Good. Now, I want you to think hard. Can you remember the surname? Krista and Yvonne. I can't think. I can't think... Krista and Yvonne what? What's the surname? Mr Tandvall is tired now. The Polish Beauty. Yes. Krista. Krista what? Krista what? Mr Wallander! Kurt. Just need their surname. (Mobile phone rings) Just their surname. The Polish Beauty. Krista. The Polish Beauty. What? Go on, Mr Tandvall. Krista Ha...Habermann. Krista Habermann. Habermann. Annika Vilhelm and Elinor Grunden. The rest, I'm afraid, are unaccounted for. Anything from the Yvonne identikit? No, nothing positive yet. This is everything we've got so far on Yvonne and Krista Habermann. You know, my hunch is that Krista may have died recently. Maybe even in the last few weeks. Try the coroner. Right, these women from the group... Annika Vilhelm's husband died six months ago, so if we're looking for potential male victims... Elinor Grunden. Right, let's go. Is there anything else you can remember about Yvonne? What I've just told you. She was a good woman. She listened. That's what I needed. What we all needed. Who did you speak about? Your husband? This may be important. We know that all the women who attended the group were under some kind of...pressure. Relationships. Men. I don't need to know details. I just need to know whoever it was you talked about. Was it your father? Was it another man? My husband is a good man. He doesn't know any of this. I met someone. It was...secret. Exciting. And then I saw another side to him. I made excuses to my husband. The bruises. I lied. And Yvonne would have known about this man? Who he was? Yes. You're going to have to tell me his name. He could be in danger. Lunnqvist. Max Lunnqvist. He works at the station. He's assistant manager there. Kurt, you were right. Krista Habermann died three weeks ago. I got the coroner's report. So, Yvonne...? Next of kin. There's an address. Vollsjo. That's it. That's the house. Left here. Left here. (Tyres screech) Police, open up! (Dog barks) (Baby cries) (She gasps) (Baby cries) Katarina? Where's Yvonne? I don't understand. She said she'd look after me. What's she done? I don't understand! It's all right. It's over now. Just tell us where Yvonne is. I don't... I don't know. She said she had to go and meet a man. Where? Where did she go? I don't know. It's all right, it's all right. (Sirens wails) Magnus? The station. We've got 12 minutes. ..Yes, Max Lunnqvist. It's urgent that we speak to him. Thank you. ..He's late for his shift. When's he due? He's meant to be seeing in that train. Get back! Get back! Get back! Back! Back! Back! Stay back! Stay back! I'll kill him! Easy. Easy. (Screaming) (She pants) Put the gun down, Yvonne. (Siren wails) It's over now. Put... (Screaming) Get back! Get back! Get up. Just put it down. Just go to the car. It's all right. It's... It's all right. Get in the car! They'll shoot you. You've got to keep close to me. You move away from me and they'll shoot you. Now, please. Just put the gun down. It's not going to bring her back. Shut up! Get in the car! They'll shoot you! Tell them! Tell them! It doesn't make any difference. It never does. They're not going to come back. They're gone! Your mother. Krista. Povel. Shut up! They're gone! You've got to live. You have to live! It's OK. It's OK. (She sobs) It's OK. I know. I know. (Gunshot) (He sobs) Bye, Dad. OK? Yeah. ♪ Oh, whisper me words ♪
