 The driver. Gunner Lundberg. They've taken him to Malmo. 
 How is he? 
 Critical. Multiple stab wounds. 
 Two teenage girls - 16 and 18. 
 One's confessed to the stabbing, the other hasn't said a word. 
 Picked them up further down the road. 
 Didn't even run. 
 Which one's confessed to the stabbing? 
 Said they needed the money. 
 How much? 
 300 krona. 
 Hardly anything. 
 Jesus. 
 OK, get them down the station, and inform the parents. 
 I'll talk to them tonight. 
 So you didn't know this man? 
 He was just a taxi driver. 
 And you needed 300 krona? 
 Like...I...said. 
 What for? 
 Drugs? Drink? 
 Just needed some cash. 
 You repeatedly stabbed a man because you "just needed some cash"? 
 Did he come on to you? 
 I told you already, I needed the money. 
 How many times are they gonna ask me these stupid questions? 
 Look at me, Sonja. 
 LOOK AT ME! What?! 
 Do you think this is important? 
 You just don't get it, do you? 
 I don't get what? 
 It just doesn't matter any more, you stupid little police person. 
 None of this matters. 
 Why doesn't it matter? 
 Why doesn't it matter? Sonja? 
 Have you got any chewing gum? 
 Right, let's start again. You and Sonja went for a pizza together, is that right? Yes. 
 And then you called for a cab? 
 Yes. 
 How did you get the number? 
 It's written by the pay phone. 
 It was completely by chance that you got Gunner Lundberg, the driver of the taxi? 
 Eva... 
 Do you know how much trouble Sonja's in? 
 Now, you can help her, Eva. 
 Tell us why she did it. 
 I've got nothing to say. 
 What did Sonja mean 
 "It doesn't matter any more"? 
 Why wouldn't it matter any more? 
 Kurt, parents are in reception. 
 You want to talk to them? 
 No, I might say something I regret. 
 Will you deal with the parents, please? 
 I'll talk to the girls again in the morning. 
 Hiya. 
 Mum's been trying to get hold of you. 
 Yeah, I've been busy. 
 She's not gonna give up, Dad. 
 Call her. 
 Tomorrow. 
 Dad! 
 No. No, Linda, please. Please. 
 It's about him, isn't it? 
 Mum wants a divorce. 
 She and Clas-Henrik want to get married. 
 I'm sorry. 
 God, I so wish you'd find someone. 
 Not tonight, Linda. 
 You can't live your life like this. 
 Dealing with this stuff. 
 Alone in this room. 
 You've got to move on, Dad. 
 Tynnes Falk, the body you saw in the square. 
 They reckon it must have been a heart attack. 
 He still had his wallet on him, everything, money, cards. 
 He was probably lying by that cash machine all night, I reckon. 
 Anyway, Svedberg's trying to trace relatives, so... 
 Um, you're in here. 
 It's just temporary, OK, while they install the new computer system. 
 They're nearly finished. It'll be worth it, be much more efficient. 
 Is that me? Yeah. 
 OK. Get Anne-Britt. We need to have another go at those girls. 
 Yeah, Linda? 
 You got it yet? What? 
 Dad, I sent you an e-mail. 
 I don't even know if we are functioning yet. 
 I've sent you a link, OK? 
 Click on it and don't shout at me. 
 Lind...?! 
 Magnus, this isn't working. 
 Lisa, what is happening with these computers? 
 We've just heard from the hospital, Kurt. The taxi driver's dead. 
 Right. 
 Are you gonna charge Sonja? 
 Kurt, have you got a minute? 
 Just let me know when you've spoken to Sonja. 
 The guy at the cash machine. 
 Yeah. You're doing the relatives, yeah? Just spoken to his ex-wife. 
 Apparently, he could not have had a heart attack. 
 Why not? 
 He's just had a medical recently for a new insurance policy and was told that he had the heart of a 20-year-old. 
 Magnus, check with the pathologist, will you? And dig around a bit. 
 There might be something. 
 Well... Dig around what? 
 His life, Magnus. 
 The thing he just lost. 
 Right. 
 Let's see how Sonja Hokberg responds to a murder charge. 
 What is it? 
 Where is she? 
 Sonja! 
 Central locking must have gone down with the computers. 
 How can that possibly happen? 
 The engineers are still testing the new system. They must have disabled the back-up. 
 It was an extraordinary circumstance. 
 They're testing a new system. 
 There was a power issue. 
 The cells were open for a short time and... Sonja escaped. 
 She was in your custody. How could she escape from a police station? 
 She's not contacted you? No. 
 Do you have any idea where she might be likely to have gone? Friends? 
 We'll need to check. Perhaps you could write the names down for us. 
 Is there any reason that you know of that Sonja would attack this taxi driver? 
 She said it was the money. 
 We give her money. 
 I'm sure there was something else. 
 What about gangs? She wasn't involved in anything like that? 
 It was nothing like that. 
 What about a boyfriend? 
 There's no boyfriend. 
 She doesn't like boys. 
 I think those are the people she sees. Thank you very much. 
 Would you mind if I took a quick look at her room? 
 Shouldn't you have a search warrant for something like that? 
 Well, I suppose, technically... 
 It's fine. 
 It's no problem. 
 Tell me about Eva. She's a bit younger than Sonja, isn't she? 
 Sonja has quite a few younger friends. We think it makes her feel stronger. 
 Stronger? 
 Yeah. Susana encourages it. 
 And...fine. 
 But no boyfriend. 
 You know what it's like with kids nowadays. 
 Who's a boyfriend, who's just a friend, it's... You know. 
 Does she have a boyfriend? 
 Jonas. 
 Jonas Landahl. 
 (Barking) 
 Jonas Landahl? 
 Jonas Landahl? 
 Police. Can I come in? 
 Hang on, man. You can't just... 
 Oh, that's...that's not mine. 
 Put it away. 
 That's a lot of equipment. 
 My music. 
 What do you want? 
 Sonja Hokberg, when did you last see her? Why, what's happened? 
 Just answer the question, please. 
 Couple of nights ago. You sure? Yeah. 
 Taxi driver was murdered last night. 
 Stabbed. Sonja confessed to it. 
 She escaped from custody earlier. 
 She's on the run. 
 Where would she go? 
 Anywhere. 
 That's not massively helpful. 
 Have you any idea why she'd go for this taxi driver? 
 She said it was for the money. 
 Money? Yeah. 300 krona. 
 This is just totally mental. 
 If she contacts you, you call me. 
 Immediately. 
 The longer she's out, the worse this is going to get for her. 
 Kurt, how did you get on? 
 She hasn't spoken to the parents, I don't think she's contacted the boyfriend. What else have we got? 
 We're going to have to go public. 
 Do you want me to make a statement? 
 No, I'll do it. 
 Thanks. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Did you get it? Get what? 
 Your e-mail? 
 Well, the system crashed. 
 I haven't had a chance. 
 Just have a look. 
 What is this? 
 I enrolled you for internet dating. 
 You just got your first reply. 
 Just go into the link, Dad, and click where it says "picture". 
 I thought that would shut you up! 
 Her name's Ella Lindfeldt and she's perfect. 
 Divorced, own apartment, likes music, solvent. 
 "Looking for a soulmate who enjoys his freedom, as I have a life and can't be with him 24/7." 
 I could have written this myself. 
 What have you said about me? Nothing embarrassing, Dad, don't worry. 
 Will you reply to it? Please. 
 Gotta go, Lin. 
 Dad... I'll see you later. 
 So...this cash machine guy. 
 Medical report from the insurance company. It's all genuine. 
 A consultant said he hasn't seen a 47-year-old heart in as good a shape as Falk's in his whole career. 
 One in a million chance, he said. 
 There's not a mark on him, apart from a slight abrasion from the fall. 
 Have you read the report on his heart? 
 Not necessarily conclusive. 
 47. Too young. 
 Let me know as soon as you've got anything, yeah? 
 (Neighing) 
 Mrs Falk? Kurt Wallander. 
 I don't think he had a heart attack. 
 (He pants) 
 I can assure you, Mrs Falk, I read the consultant's report on your husband's heart. 
 So you agree with me? 
 If it wasn't a heart attack, I mean... I don't know. 
 He was just on edge so much lately. 
 Nervy. Secretive. 
 I had a feeling he was up to something. What kind of thing? 
 Tynnes was always full of schemes. 
 He worked a lot in the Third World. 
 Africa. 
 There was always some plan for saving the world. 
 He worked in IT, yes? 
 He went into businesses to sort out their computer systems. 
 He was very good. 
 Talented. 
 Were you still close? 
 We have a child. 
 So we'd see one another often. 
 Neither of us had found anyone else. 
 I think that's why... why I have to know. 
 For certain. 
 Maybe then I'll finally be able to move on. 
 Hi, Ella. 
 I'm around... tonight. 
 8.15 any good? 
 Best wishes, Kurt Wallander. 
 Best wishes, best wishes... 
 No. 
 Best...Kurt. 
 Sorry, Lisa, just so you know... 
 I was supposed to be out of here by eight tonight. 
 It's nothing, it's...personal. 
 OK, we've got people at Sonja's parents' place. Yep. 
 And the boyfriend's, Landahl's. 
 Lisa : OK. We have to establish if Sonja's a genuine threat, Kurt. 
 Are people in danger from this girl? 
 My instinct says not, but we should put out an armed-and-dangerous call. 
 Until we know why she killed this man, we can't be sure of anything. 
 Apparently Sonja's boyfriend's not at home. 
 That was his parents on the phone, and they sound worried. 
 OK, well, we'd better find him, then. 
 (They all talk at once) 
 Radio : It's 8.45 on Midsummer's Eve, the longest day of the year. 
 Time for a check on the headlines. 
 A manhunt is under way after a murder suspect escaped from police custody. 
 18-year-old Sonja Hokberg... 
 Come on...! 
 Oh, Christ! 
 Sorry, excuse me... Ella? 
 Er...Ella Lindfeldt? Um... 
 Yes. 
 I'm Kurt Wallander. Um... 
 I'm so sorry... 
 45 minutes late? 20, maybe, but not 45. 
 OK. Look. I'm... 
 I-I-I'm a policeman. 
 I'm a detective. I just couldn't get away before this. I'm sorry. 
 This is our first meeting and I've been sitting here for 45 minutes. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hello? 
 It's Sonja. 
 It's Sonja?! 
 This is her bracelet. She fiddled with it when we questioned her. 
 Are you sure? 
 It's hers. 
 What was she doing here? 
 Some kind of...bizarre suicide? 
 It's a possibility. 
 Everything's a possibility. 
 Are we calling this a crime scene, then? 
 Only I've got half of Skane waiting for the lights to go back on. 
 I think we have to. We need to know exactly how she died. 
 It might not have been here. 
 We're not certain. But... we did find...this. 
 It's hers! 
 I knew it would end like this! 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Sorry?! 
 You should be sorry. 
 You let her go, you... stupid, idiot man! 
 What?! 
 If the police were any good at their job, none of this would've happened. 
 'I always think, when I have to do that, what if that was me?' 
 What if some faceless policeman... came and told me that you'd been hurt. 
 Or killed. 
 You're not a faceless policeman. 
 I am to them. 
 I used to like power cuts. 
 They were cosy. 
 I, er... 
 I went on a date tonight. 
 You replied?! 
 Oh, my God! What happened? 
 I was late. She chucked me. 
 You were late? 
 It was impossible, it... 
 I know! But does there always have to be something more important than you having a life? 
 You're not going back to the station now? 
 Malmstrom speaking. 
 Kurt Wallander. 
 Thought I'd missed you. 
 Just off. You got my message? 
 Yeah, about Sonja Hokberg? 
 I've done some initial tests. 
 I'm fairly certain her neck had been broken before she was thrown onto those power lines. 
 You're fairly certain? 90%. 
 Difficult to tell, of course. 
 What about Falk? 
 The guy from the cash machine? 
 I e-mailed you a preliminary report. 
 Initial tests, heart sound as a bell, blood fine. 
 No sign of poisoning. 
 So we're still not certain? 
 I need to take another look. 
 I thought Sonja was more important. 
 Yeah. Thanks. 
 On tape : 10.12pm, Wallander and Hogland with Sonja... 
 You just don't get it, do you? 
 ..doesn't matter any more... 
 None of this matters. 
 Why doesn't it matter? 
 Why doesn't it matter, Sonja? 
 You got any chewing gum? 
 Morning. 
 God, you look awful. You OK? 
 I spoke with the pathologist last night. 
 Looks like Sonja was murdered. 
 Um, Kurt...? I know this is weird, but I've just had the morgue on the phone. 
 Falk's body's gone missing. 
 Someone's taken it. 
 When was the last time he was checked? 
 Pathologist put him in here about 9.30 last night. 
 And it was ten hours before he was missed? 
 We don't usually check them when they're in here. 
 They tend to stay put. 
 This door we came in, is this the only one to the outside? 
 There's a back exit over here. 
 It's where the undertakers pick up. 
 Whispers : Sonja... 
 The power cut? What, Sonja's murder? 
 No, that's crazy. 
 This is a completely different case. 
 Not any more. 
 Surely it's just a coincidence. 
 Where did Falk live? 
 Klostargatan somewhere, I think. 
 I'll get a search warrant sorted. 
 It'll take a day, obviously. 
 We haven't got a day. 
 Just get me the address. 
 And would you look at my computer? 
 Eva Malmstrom sent me an e-mail about Falk's autopsy. 
 I haven't got it. 
 Is it the computer, is it me...? 
 That's strange. 
 When did she send it? 
 I think it must have been last night. 
 Right. 
 Ooh! What? 
 Nice. Um...is she a friend of yours? 
 OK, Magnus. That's fine. 
 I can sort this. 
 What about Malmstrom's e-mail? 
 I'll deal with it. If you could get me Falk's address, that'd be great. Thanks. 
 "I think I may have overreacted last night. 
 "Still want to meet for a coffee? 
 That would be... 
 "..lovely. Ella." 
 Hi. Oh, hi. 
 Um...it's behind the main square. 
 It wasn't hard. 
 Uh...well... 
 Um...would you... 
 Do you want a tea or coffee, or...? 
 Um...do you know, a white wine sounds better. 
 Oh, course. Um...excuse me. 
 Glass of white wine, please, and I'll have another coffee. 
 Oh, so policemen really don't drink while they're on duty. 
 Well... Are you on duty? 
 Not sure I know the difference any more. 
 I'm sorry about last night. 
 It's gone. Forgotten. 
 I think...actually... 
 Could I change my order? I'll have a beer instead of the coffee. 
 Thank God for that! 
 ...He was a mentor to me when I was starting out. 
 I used to go blundering in to these places. 
 He'd hold up his hand and say 
 "Shut up and stand still. Absolutely still. Just listen to the room." 
 To a room? 
 Well, obviously not to the actual room. 
 But what it was telling you about the people who'd been there. 
 Listen and you can hear them. 
 And you can hear people when they're not there. 
 You know, you just have to listen. 
 God. 
 The poet detective. 
 Well, I...I should shut up and listen to you. 
 Do you come from Ystad? 
 Originally, yeah. 
 And, um...then there was a husband. 
 He worked for a US bank and we spent a lot of time abroad. 
 Angola, mainly. And... then that finished. 
 And...now I'm just back here in Ystad. 
 And you? 
 Uh... We... we said we'd do the divorce if either of us found anyone. 
 And she has? 
 Yeah. A golfer, apparently. 
 Yeah, a golfer. 
 Why does everybody think that's funny except me? 
 I don't know. Thank you. 
 You will. You will in time. 
 Yeah. Maybe. 
 Erm... could...could I see you again? 
 Yes. Yes, I would like that a lot. 
 Yeah? 
 OK... 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Oh, sorry, I've got to... 
 Yeah? 
 
 
 
 I'm not interrupting anything, am I? 
 Nope. 
 Falk's address. 
 It's apartment 1, 6 Klostargatan. 
 OK. 
 But there's still no search warrant. 
 Yeah. 
 Understood. I'm on my way there now. 
 We found a body yesterday, but the actual... confirmation's just been made. 
 It is her. 
 I'm sorry. 
 How did she die? 
 How?! 
 We're not sure yet. 
 Eva... I need to know the truth of what happened that night. 
 The taxi driver. 
 She changed when the taxi arrived. 
 Went all weird. 
 Then she asked him to pull over cos she felt a bit sick. 
 She screamed at me to hold him. 
 There was blood everywhere. 
 Eva, did she tell you why she did it? 
 Eva, you have to tell me. 
 I promised. Eva, Sonja was murdered. 
 Have you any idea who might have killed her? 
 What about Jonas, her boyfriend? 
 Was there anything they were involved in? 
 You should talk to her parents. 
 It was my fault. Erik... 
 What's the point any more? 
 She's dead, isn't she? 
 Three years ago, when Sonja was 15, she was assaulted. 
 Sexually assaulted. 
 That's not on the record, we'd have found it. 
 No, we did report it to the police, but they informed us that the man in question had a perfectly sound alibi, so we decided not to pursue it any further. 
 She knew her attacker, didn't she? 
 It was Lundberg. It was the taxi driver. 
 It was his son. Carl-Einar. 
 Lundberg gave his son an alibi. 
 Got him out of the country. 
 But this was three years ago. 
 Why now? 
 I don't know. 
 I should have told you. 
 I did what I thought was best for my daughter. 
 Wouldn't you have done the same? 
 Did Sonja ever mention a man called Tynnes Falk? 
 No. 
 Thanks. 
 Revenge? 
 Well, we knew it wasn't the money. 
 But who killed Sonja? 
 What about Lundberg's son? 
 The one who raped her? 
 He'd be the obvious suspect, wouldn't he? Lives up north. 
 Stockholm police are with him now. 
 He's got a credible alibi for the last 48 hours and was devastated when he heard about his father. It's not him. 
 They're 100%. 
 Sonja was raped three years ago. 
 So why...why choose now to kill Lundberg? 
 Why wasn't she bothered about being caught? 
 "It doesn't matter any more." 
 Maybe she wanted revenge so badly, nothing else did matter. 
 So why the three-year wait? 
 I'm certain it's got something to do with Falk. 
 Where are we on that Falk search warrant? 
 It's going to take a day, Kurt. 
 It's Midsummer. 
 Where are you going? 
 Falk's apartment. 
 He's dead, Lisa. So let him sue me. 
 It's a hollow-point bullet. 
 Dum-dum. 
 Would have taken your head off. 
 You know, I just tripped on the bloody rug! 
 Clumsy b*st*rd. 
 Kurt? You OK? 
 Yeah. 
 There was a notebook here. 
 It had entries for every night recently. 
 "Check CM, midnight, check CM, 11.45, check CM, midnight," etc. 
 CM? 
 Cash machine. The receipts were there too. 
 Well, it must mean something. 
 And there was a picture on the wall over there. 
 It was Falk and...another man. 
 There was a photograph in your ex-husband's apartment. 
 Tynnes and another man, skinny, glasses. 
 It could have been taken abroad. 
 Kristian Suneson. 
 You know him? 
 He came to stay with Tynnes a couple of times after we split up. 
 They worked together in Africa. 
 They designed software systems for large corporations. 
 Is there anything else you could tell me about him? 
 I didn't like him. 
 He had some very strange ideas. 
 I remember he got drunk at a dinner once, and launched into a diatribe about the world having reverted to chaos. 
 The rich raping the poor. 
 The obscenity of the Third World. 
 Your husband worked in IT, but there was no computer in his apartment. 
 Can you explain that? 
 He rented a room in the basement of his building. 
 He worked down there when he was in the country. 
 Sorry, excuse me. 
 Yes? We've found Falk's body. 
 Yeah, where? 
 Svarte beach. It's not pretty. 
 Someone's hacked off his hands and feet. 
 OK. I'll see you there. 
 Sorry, I have to... 
 Thank you very much. 
 If there's anything, I'll... 
 Thanks. 
 Why would anyone do that to a dead body? 
 Let's get him back to the morgue. 
 And I need anything we can get on a guy called Kristian Suneson. 
 Worked with Falk in Africa. 
 Martinsson's checking out the basement at his apartment now. 
 Let's get over there, then. 
 Jesus! 
 Jonas Landahl. Sonja's boyfriend. 
 He had exactly the same set-up. 
 This has gotta be the link between Sonja and Falk, hasn't it? 
 What did I do? 
 Oh, come on... 
 Look, I'm sorry, but it could take me weeks to crack into something like this. 
 Yeah, we need to get into this. Now. 
 What's your problem? 
 Mr Modin? 
 What's he done now? 
 That's not why I'm here. 
 Hiya, Robert. 
 Get your box of tricks. 
 I've got a job for you. 
 So you've stopped hacking into other people's computers, then? 
 Mostly. That community service stuff. 
 Met loads of people. 
 Bad people, obviously, but... kind of interesting. 
 Hi, it's Ella. 
 Hi. 'Can you talk?' 
 Is it... Are you busy? 
 No, it's fine. 
 'I, um...' 
 I had a really nice time earlier. 
 Me, too. I was going to call you later. 
 I'm around tonight, if you wanted to do something. 
 Hesitantly : Yeah... 
 Is that difficult? 
 No, I mean, it would be...good. 
 OK! Um...do you know Vystrom's? 
 Vystrom's? On the harbour? Sure. 
 8.30? Yeah, um... 
 On the dot. 
 OK. 
 Bye. Bye. 
 Cool. I see your problem. 
 You do? Yeah. 
 Fingerprint ID protected. 
 Meaning...? This pad? 
 You press your thumb on it and you're in. 
 Only it has to be the right thumb. 
 The hands. Falk. 
 Is there a way round it? 
 There's always a way round it. 
 I need something he touched. 
 What about a glass? 
 Perfect. 
 Yes! 
 Awesome. 
 We're in. 
 Wow! 
 What is this?! 
 Can you crack it? 
 Take a while. How long? 
 Hard to say. But I'm going to need some serious snacks. 
 You make sure he gets what he wants. 
 Hello? 
 What do you mean? 
 You know who? 
 On my way. 
 Down there! 
 God only knows what I'm supposed to do with this. He's been put through the bloody crusher. 
 Are we sure it's Sonja's boyfriend? 
 I can't tell yet. 
 Kurt... 
 The registration's confirmed. 
 It belongs to Sonja's boyfriend. 
 He tried to run. 
 From something. 
 You're not really here, are you? 
 Look, was this a bad idea? 
 No, I'm sorry. It was a good idea. 
 OK, um...you can either sit here brooding for the next two hours or you can talk about it. 
 Don't tell me you're the only man on the planet who won't talk about his work. 
 OK. 
 There's a girl... 
 The one who killed the taxi driver? 
 I read about it. 
 I'm suddenly very interested in the business of the Ystad police department. I can't think why. 
 What is it with that elastic band, by the way? 
 Is that some sort of strange love token? 
 No. It's just to remind me to get some food for my cat. 
 So, look, come on. 
 You were telling me, this girl. 
 She escaped, didn't she? 
 Yeah, she did escape. 
 OK. 
 Yeah, turns out she was raped when she was 15. 
 And she took some kind of revenge. 
 And now she's dead too. 
 She was murdered. 
 And this evening we found her boyfriend. Dead? 
 Was he part of this revenge thing? 
 No. There's something else going on. 
 Somebody wants something kept very secret. 
 I think these kids... 
 I don't know, they knew too much, they were a liability... 
 We were talking to them, so... 
 Do you always get like this? 
 It's just it seems...so personal. 
 Yeah... 
 Shouldn't you try to remember the good that you do? 
 The bigger picture? 
 I don't really think that there is a bigger picture. 
 This is where we live. 
 Here. Now. 
 Just... 
 These are our lives. 
 And they're fragile, they're precarious. 
 They're miraculous. 
 They're all we have. 
 And... for Sonja... and Jonas... 
 It doesn't really seem...fair. 
 Sorry. I don't mean to sound off. 
 You weren't. 
 Poet detective. 
 Anyway, um... you were saying there was a secret. 
 That somebody was trying to protect a secret. 
 Sorry and everything. 
 This is important. 
 Where's Martinsson? 
 I sent him out to get a drink. He's been ages. I need to talk to you. 
 Ella, this is Robert Modin. 
 This is Ella. Hello, Robert Modin. 
 How did you find me? 
 The phone call. In the car. 
 Look, I need to talk to you. 
 It's fine. I understand. 
 I'll hang on in there. 
 OK, let's go. 
 His name's Robert Modin. 
 It's an online assault on the European Banking System. 
 There was something similar last year. In Estonia? 
 Was blamed on the Russian secret service. Yeah, I remember that. 
 Practically brought the country to a halt. 
 Well, this is bigger. Much bigger. 
 Each of these windows contains malicious computer code ready to be sent to a server inside a financial institution. 
 This is for a stockbroker in London, this is aimed at the mainframe inside the National Bank of Sweden, this one, a savings bank in Turin. 
 All individually targeted attacks, set up and ready to go. 
 These places are protected. 
 Passwords, security. 
 Forget that. Whoever's behind this has already got them. 
 It's the scale of this you should be worried about. 
 There are attacks on thousands of European financial institutions lined up here. 
 They've hijacked people's systems. 
 What is it, some sort of cyber-robbery? No. 
 That's what's so weird. I don't think they're trying to steal anything. 
 These codes are designed to erase data and shut down servers. 
 Whoever's behind this doesn't want money. They want to eliminate financial systems. 
 Create a run on the banks. 
 Panic. Chaos. 
 Kristian Suneson. 
 We need to get on to Stockholm Crime Bureau. 
 You don't have time. 
 What do you mean? 
 This is all set up to happen tonight. 
 Tonight? 
 Midnight on the 20th. 
 That's less than three hours away. 
 He's right, you can't just call up Central Bank and expect them to change their security set-up in three hours. 
 There must be a trigger somewhere, right? 
 Yeah. A trigger? 
 Something someone needs to do to activate this. 
 I just need to find what it is so you can get to it before they do. 
 If Modin's right, we've got 2½ hours. What have we got on Suneson? 
 Kristian suneson. corporate IT executive and part-time activist. 
 Gothenberg 2001. Warsaw 2004. 
 Gleneagles 2005. 
 Interpol have got a file on him. 
 He's low risk but they've kept an eye on him cos of his work in IT. 
 Now we know why. Do we? Stockholm thinks it's just a fantasy. 
 What do they think about two mangled corpses? Is that a fantasy? 
 Are you serious? You think this is some kind of terrorist cell? 
 Yes! Small-time, but now totally out of control. 
 Suneson and Falk at the centre of it with Sonja and Landahl as some kind of useful foot-soldiers, recruited over the internet. 
 Chatrooms. Disaffected kids. 
 Promised some kind of a better future. 
 "It doesn't matter any more." 
 Right. Sonja's mantra. 
 So the taxi driver was some kind of bizarre coincidence? 
 I think it just landed in Sonja's lap. That's why Eva said Sonja changed. 
 The taxi arrived at the pizza place, Sonja recognised Lundberg, wanted revenge for the sexual assault, and given what she thought was gonna happen with the chaos and anarchy, believed she could get away with it. 
 And she went for it. 
 And Falk? 
 Pathologist called me earlier. 
 She did a further autopsy on what was left of him. 
 Tynnes Falk died from an embolism in his brain. 
 One in a million. In the square, in Ystad. 
 Yeah? 
 Martinsson. Modin's disappeared. 
 He said he needed a breather. 
 I was just inside the door. 
 I looked out after he didn't come back in and he was gone. 
 There's a message on the screen. 
 I think it must have freaked him out. 
 What message? 
 There was a message right here. 
 Just a minute ago. 
 It said, "Robert Modin, you have been traced." 
 OK, where is he? 
 Last I saw him, he was with you. 
 Robert! 
 Robert! 
 Robert! Robert, it's me. Kurt. 
 You OK? They traced me. 
 It freaked me. All those people getting killed. And then... 
 What? 
 I got in a taxi, I think we were being followed. 
 You know who? I don't know. 
 It was like a van thing. 
 Blue Mercedes, yeah? 
 You know it? 
 What happened to it? I don't know. 
 We turned down the lane and it carried on. 
 I couldn't see in the fog. 
 It's all right. You're going to be fine. 
 They know. They know I nearly got it. 
 What? 
 The trigger! It's not in the system. 
 It's outside somewhere. 
 How do you mean? 
 Whatever's going to happen is set up to be triggered by something outside. 
 Something really normal. 
 Something wired in. 
 So whoever triggers it doesn't need to be near a computer. 
 They simply set it in motion. 
 What kind of thing? 
 Anything. Telephone. 
 Security camera. Library card. 
 Something networked. Something mundane that's been pre-programmed. 
 Stay here. 
 Where are you going? 
 Do you have a gun? Shotgun. Load it. 
 Don't let anyone in this house. 
 Angola. 
 I knew there was something wrong when Falk's wife mentioned Africa. 
 I didn't want to see... 
 There's a woman. 
 Ella. 
 I know. 
 We all know. 
 Martinsson. 
 I've seen her a couple of times. 
 And she... obviously she's been... tapping me for information. 
 I didn't realise. 
 I thought... 
 Christ, what did I think? 
 You're sure she's involved? 
 Yes! It's her and this Suneson guy. 
 She set me up. 
 Understand? She set me up! 
 They must have hacked into our computers, or they crashed the system so they could do it. They found Linda's e-mail about the dating site. 
 They knew we were talking to Sonja and Landahl. They needed to know what we knew. 
 I mean, that's where she... that's where she...um... 
 You know what we've got to do, Kurt? 
 Hello? 
 Ella? Kurt! 
 Sorry I missed your call earlier. 
 That's OK. Was it a bad time? 
 You could say that. 
 So how's it going? 
 Honestly? Total cock-up. 
 Well, that's honest. Listen. 
 I know it's late. 
 And I know this is pushing it a bit, but... 
 I wondered if you fancied a nightcap. 
 I'm not sure... Please. 
 I've had a God-awful day. 
 And I feel a bit guilty about leaving you in the lurch earlier. 
 Do you know, I think it's probably a bit late for me to come out. 
 Maybe I could come over to yours. 
 No strings. Honestly, just... 
 I-I-I really don't think that's a great idea. I... 
 Just half an hour? 
 OK. If...if that's what you'd like. 
 Thanks. Yeah, yeah. 
 That's what I'd really like. 
 So, um... where are you? 
 I'm in Enslighten. First house on the Malmo road. Ten minutes? 
 OK. 
 You like him. 
 He's a good man. 
 And ours is a good cause. 
 You are still strong, aren't you? 
 Yes. 
 Yes. I'm still strong. 
 We've got the house surrounded. 
 Guns down unless I give the order. 
 Ella. 
 It's OK. I'm sorry. 
 Ella...Ella...? 
 It's OK. 
 It's OK, it's OK. 
 Ella... I'm sorry... 
 The trigger. It's the cash machine! 
 Kurt! 
 Kurt, wait! You'll need backup! 
 You didn't have to kill her! 
 Why did you have to kill her? 
 You stopped her believing. 
 Kurt! Kurt, leave him! 
 Don't touch it! 
 He put the card in. I don't think he punched in the numbers. 
 Dad? 
 What are you doing here? 
 It's four o'clock in the morning. 
 Anne-Britt called me. 
 They were worried about you. 
 Dad, I'm so sorry. 
 It's my fault. I started it. 
 I'm so sorry... 
 No. No. Don't be sorry. 
 You were right. 
 I thought I was dead. 
 Inside. 
 But I'm not, am I? 
 Can we go home?
