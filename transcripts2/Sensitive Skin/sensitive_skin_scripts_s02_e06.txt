 Willy! Oh, God. Why does he do that? 
 Can't you see that you're hurting me by being here? 
 Goodbye, my love. 
 He confessed. 
 Why?! Seemed like the only way we could both be free. I just don't like Cheryl. Cheryl and I are getting married. S02E06 - Here I Am (distant seagulls) Lizzie? I haven't seen you for ages. I've been hiding. I love standing here in the prow of the boat, seeing what's ahead. Me too. Hello, William. No, no, no you don't. You, stay! He's been so bad lately. Why? What's he done? Well, he keeps jumping into the water and trying to swim away. Jack Russell Terriers aren't swimmers! Well, this one is. It's like some ancient instinct. And what's even stranger is that once he's in, he starts swimming towards the open water. (sighing): I don't know why. He's swimming for the blue horizon. Do you know why I live on a boat? Why? In case I have the urge to sail away and have an adventure in some exotic location. Which I've never done. I keep her all ship-shape and gassed up and ready to go, but I've never left the marina. Well, it is Lake Ontario. What exotic land would you sail to? Rochester? Are you OK, Lizzie? Never better. I missed you, you know. You're the only sane person on the island. Do you know how old I am? No. I'm 24678 days old. Wow, you worked that out. Mm, I worked that out. Do you know how many of those days I've been waiting? 15532. And more than half of those days tied to that dock. What were you waiting for? No idea. But today? Today I woke up and I thought, no more waiting. I can do something. I have a choice. (cellphone ringing) Oh! Oh, it's, it's Orlando. He's getting married, you know. To a woman who could be his mother... mathematically, anyway. Excuse me. Dodo... What? A blessing? Well, what kind of a blessing? No, I... No, I can't do that. Because I don't share your belief system! Dodo? What? No. I do not hate Cheryl. It's just... it's awkward. It's not because she's a Christian, it's because she's my age, obviously. ♪♪ Ooh, spell ♪ 
♪ Ooh, spell ♪ 
♪ I put a spell on you Ooh, spell ♪ 
♪ Ooh, spell ♪ 
♪ 'Cause you're mine ♪ 
♪ Ooh, spell ♪ 
♪ Ooh, spell ♪ 
♪ Because ♪ 
♪ You're mine ♪ 
♪ Spell ♪♪ That's it on the end. (distant honking) (Davina sighing) Are you OK? I knew something was wrong. We used to have all of these regular lunches and then she just disappeared. Maybe I could have done something. She was determined. She thought the whole thing through very carefully. What's this? The key for the boat. Why? She left it to you. I, I don't understand. I guess she had some feeling that you might be able to make some use out of it. (quietly): Oh, Lizzie. (sighing) (car honking) (quiet classical music plays) You see, this really pisses me off, this kind of painting. Ugh, you're in a mood. No, I'm not. I'm allowed to have opinions. It's not the artist's fault that your son fell in love with my ex. That has nothing to do with it. We were doing this 30 years ago: the awesome power of the blank canvas. Ah, but it's not blank. Uh, yes it is. There's something there. Where? Look carefully. I can't see anything. Keep looking. For Christ's sake, give me a clue. The whole point is that you have to find it yourself. I give up! Oh... That dot? There you go. There's writing: "Here I am." And the piece is called  Love. Oh, come on. Because you have to look for it. You might as well call it  The Terrorist Threat,  because you have to look for it. I had no idea you were so cynical. I'm not cynical. I seem to recall that you were in love at one point. Yes, yes, I was in love, and you know what? I didn't need a magnifying glass to find it. It just appeared. As big as life. And it said, "Hi, my name is Al." I gotta go. They won't let me in if I'm late. Oh. Say hi for me. Sam says hi. That's nice. So... how is it? Apart from the looming specter of violence, not bad. Of course, there are some unpleasant characters. On the whole, it's a lot like high school. Only with bars on the windows and the teachers have guns. Oh, Roger. No! They might think you're trying to pass me heroin. Then I get strip-searched. (indistinct men's voices) How's Veronica? Fine. Is she gonna move in with Gimpy? With Lenny? I don't know. Maybe. Good for her. Oh, Roger... No, don't. Don't be like that. It's what I wanted. It has to be this way. So what are you going to do when you get out? Start again. How? I don't know. That's the beauty of it. The blank canvas, waiting to be filled in. (boat bell ringing) Orlando : Bye, Mom! I love you! I'll see you at the wedding. OK, bye! Davina : Bye. 
 
 William? (whistling) Willy? William! (seagulls squawking) (boat bells ringing) Willy? (whistling) Here, boy! William? William! (singsong): Willy! (bird chirping) (quietly): Oh, Willy. William! Oh, excuse me! Have you seen a little Jack Russell Terrier? No. (sighing) Willy? Come on, Willy. Willy! Uh, excuse me? Excuse me. Have you seen a little Jack Russell Terrier anywhere around here? I don't think so. Did we? A what? (loudly): A dog. She's lost her dog. It's a Jack Russell Terrier. He might have been in the water somewhere here... Jack Russells don't like water. I saw something swimming off over there, but it could have been a beaver. Thanks. (engine revving) (whispering): Let's see. (engine roaring) Ah! (cracking) Whoa! (engine dying) (whistling) Here, boy. Willy! WILLY! Willy, Willy, Willy! Have you seen a little dog? Roger :  I read about your friend in the paper. I'm sorry. Me too. How are you coping? Uh, not well. I saw myself in her, a few years down the road. Living in a boat that never leaves the dock. But you would never... Oh, no. But... I understood why she did it. Oh, sweetheart. Willy?! Willy? Willy! (engine sputtering) (engine silent) No. (engine stalling) Oh, f*ck. Oh, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! (gasp) f*ck! (whispering): sh1t. Harbour police. Hi, yes, I am in the middle of the lake on a boat and I'm looking for my dog and the engine just stalled and I don't know what to do. What is your location? I'm... well, I'm here. I'm, I'm between the city and the island. What kind of craft? I wanna say that it's a cabin cruiser. Does that have a sail? No, no, it has an engine. That's what it has. May I have your license number? Uh, my driver's license? Your Boat Smart license? I don't know what that is. The boat belongs to a friend of mine... I... Look. I just really, really, really need to find my dog. So this isn't your boat. You know... I'm OK. And I'm... the engine just started, and I'm just pulling into, into the dock and thank you so much for all of your help. (sighing) (soft piano music) Everyone tells me you have to give in to it. Experience the grief, the loneliness. Why? Whenever I wake up, I don't know how I'm going to face the day, never mind the rest of my life. It will get better. You'll see. (crying): It's not like I'm the only person who's ever lost someone. I feel so... weak. (heavy breathing) I'm alone... on a boat... at night, in the water. And I'm... safe. I'm OK. Al, I know you're not here. And that's OK too. (geese honking) (birds chirping) (seagulls squawking) (engine revving) Roger :  Weak is pretending you don't have a problem. You'll see. It'll happen. One day you'll look up and there'll be blue sky above and you'll be free. Not the same way as before, Thank you. (gasping): Oh! I forgot about the strip search. They'd have done it anyway. It's their thing. (bird twittering) (sighing) Hello? Oh, hello. Can I help you? (with accent): I was wondering if you knew who this dog belongs to? (gasping) William! Oh, thank God! Oh! Where did you find him? On the boat. Which boat? This one. Mine. The police called me. I came home to check on it. Apparently someone was stealing boats last night and taking joy ridings. Oh, uh... That was me, but it wasn't much of a joy ride. You must be Sam's friend from Brazil. Yeah. Alexander Rafael Olivero Capocanci. But it's a long name. You can call me Al. Al. Yeah. And you are? Uh, I'm Davina. It's flooded! See? I can smell the gas. You must have dried out overnight, that's why you could start it again. So you live in Brazil? Some of the time, yeah. My business takes me back and forth. And the houseboat? Oh, I bought it with my ex-girlfriend. We were going to live on it, but it didn't work out. Hm. But you are welcome to stay. I have several houses here in the city. Several? Well, three. Look, I'm on my way to a demonstration. We are gathering here on the island and then we're all going to head to City Hall. Few years ago I started a project for disadvantaged children, to come over here and spend some time on the island, taking art classes. It's been a huge success, only now the city's threatening to cut the funding. Oh, that's terrible. Yeah. You wanna come? I promise it will be nice, fun. Oh, um, Al... exander, I'm sorry, but... my husband died a couple of months ago, and I'm just starting to deal with that, so I'm not ready. And anyway, I don't need anyone. I don't need to be rescued by anybody. I just proved that. So, um, thank you, but... I'm not ready. I wasn't asking you out. Oh. It's just that we really need as many people as we can to help with the signs. Well, OK. Um... I have some time. (voices) ♪♪ The more that you put into life ♪

(whispering): I forgot. I forgot about it. (whispering): Mom, seriously. I'm not prepared. Oh, it's just a short blessing before the vows. It's a tradition in this church. Doesn't have to be anything fancy. I give you both now to Jesus, and I thank Jesus and God. I know they're the same, but different. They're related. I had a son too, that I lost for a while, like God, so I can relate to God. We have a kinship, even though... (coughing): Wrap it up, Mom. Bless you both. Orlando. Cheryl. I know that God has ordained this love and I thank Jesus for the honour of going through time with you. Cheryl? Orlando... I pledge to you my life as a faithful and loving wife. Whither thou goest, I will go. Where thou lodgest, I will lodge. Orlando and Cheryl, I now pronounce you man and wife. (applause and laughing) Hey! You don't have to call me Dad or anything. I wasn't gonna, man. Davina : Thanks. Orlando! We gotta go, we gotta go. I gotta go! Here, this is for you. What is it? It's a deposit for a house. You know how you said you lost your family home? Well, I'm giving it back to you. I can't accept this. Well, it's not just from me. It's from a friend. And she would have given anything to see a wedding like this. I don't know what... Orlando, come on! I'm coming! Thank you. You gonna be OK? Yes, of course. Go! I want you to keep William. What? He was always happier with you than he ever was with me. Oh, sweetheart. Go, go on! Your bride is waiting! I love you! I love... you!
