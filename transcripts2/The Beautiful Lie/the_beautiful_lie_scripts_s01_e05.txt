 The lawyer says I'm entitled to more than half the land. 
 Well, Mum and Dad left us this place 50/50, so... 
 Do you want a vodka? 
 Uh, no. 
 Cocaine-laced hashish? 
 He's getting worse. 
 He's fine. 
 (Yells) 
 (Laughs) 
 I'm nearly 40. 
 I think I know which path we're on and which one we're not. 
 There's no-one else on this earth for me. 
 Will you marry me? 
 Yes! 
 I was in that Nature's Wellness thing, the vitamin ad. 
 (Scoffs) 
 Don't be jealous. 
 Don't insult me! 
 I know how this ends up. I was her once, remember? 
 I told Anna that she can come home if she likes. 
 To your home? 
 This is what we're good at, Anna -- my family. 
 I don't want a divorce. 
 You'll find someone, Xander. 
 Baby, your lips are trembling. 
 I don't want to lose you. 
 We're OK, Anna. 
 I don't want to see Mum anymore. 
 Then you won't.

 When Kasper was born, we almost lost him. 
 He wasn't breathing. 
 I found myself begging a god I didn't believe in to let me keep him. 
 What would that god think of me now? 
 I wanted to love her. 
 I really did. 
 A little sting. 
 There we go. Should do the trick. 
 These sporting injuries can flare up as the body resets after giving birth. 
 Is there something else? 
 Um, yeah, can you... breastfeed with alprazolam? 
 It's just that I've got a... lot of flying coming up. 
 Not right away but in the next few months, and... my prescription's run out. 
 I'm already weaning her, so... 
 Flying. I hate planes. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 So there's no problem with alcohol or any other substances? 
 No. 
 You will need to wean the baby. 
 Yeah, I thought so. 
 I'll just ring this through. 
 Right, service side. Let's go! Go! Hustle, hustle, hustle! 
 Baseline, all the way to the net. Push, push, push, push, push! 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go! 
 Baseline. Push hard, push hard. 
 That's it. Back here now. Bring it home. 
 Bring it home, bring it home. Alright! 
 (Pants) 
 How are you doing? 
 Good. 
 Good? 
 Your lungs burn? - Yep. 
 Your legs hurt? - Yep. 
 Feel that air coming in when you breathe? - Yep. 
 That air is telling you that you're a winner, OK? 
 So when this burns and these hurt, you look across the net to the other guy and you know that he's doing worse than you, that's when you know you've beaten him... yeah? - Yeah. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Alright. Good boy. 
 Back in a tick. 
 (Sighs) 
 Hello? 
 Can I come in? 
 In where? 
 To the house. 
 Yeah, I'm not home. 
 When will you be home, then? 
 It's really none of your business. 
 If this is about the settlement papers, they're in the mail. 
 You keep saying that but they somehow never come. 
 I can see your car, by the way. 
 I left it at home. 
 I can see you, Xander. You're in the window. 
 It's probably the cleaner. 
 It's you! I know it's you! 
 What are you doing here? 
 Can I come in... please? 
 No. 
 What are you trying to do to me? 
 You're sending me messages through the media now. 
 Wasn't aware of doing so. 
 Uh... 'The last year has been devastating', 'I am devastated by the end of my marriage'. 
 Trying to see how many times you can fit 'devastated' into a sentence? 
 I don't have to explain myself to you. 
 Would it kill you, I wonder, not to parade your devastation in the media... 
 Oh, piss off. 
 Excuse me? 
 Piss off! 
 I was devastated. I am devastated. 
 Who are you to come round here and tell me what I can and what I can't? 
 This was our life, Anna. 
 There's nothing wrong with it and you destroyed it. 
 So if I say I'm devastated, then that's what I am. 
 It's the media and so we just... we both need to be adults. 
 (Scoffs) 
 Oh, that is... that is laughable coming from you. 
 Go home. 
 (Phone rings) 
 (Beeps) 
 (Sighs) 
 (Phone rings) 
 (Sighs) 
 What? 
 I want to see Kasper. 
 Well, he doesn't want to see you. 
 You're a very good gatekeeper, Xander, but can we please let Kasper decide whether he wants to? 
 I'm not going to force him to see you. 
 Let me say hello, then. Please, don't keep him from... 
 You abandoned him. 
 I didn't abandon... 
 I'm trying to give him an environment where he feels safe. 
 Things he can rely on. A sense of himself in the world. 
 Breakfast time, a healthy lunch, two chapters at bedtime. 
 I'm the one who gets up in the middle of the night and sits with him when he's scared. 
 I'm the one who stayed.

 Uh, let's just go again. 
 Wanna close the door? 
 Alright. 
 (Clears throat) 
 (Song resumes) 
 Have you got wine? 
 Yes, thank you. 
 Probably had... enough, haven't you, darling? 
 Nice of you to host tonight. 
 Looks great. 
 Yeah, well, it's both of us. 
 Well, he did all the work. 
 He's been wanting to show off his cooking skills. 
 I've got to find something to do. 
 Back in town, I had a mothers' group. 
 They gave me the sh1ts but it was company. 
 What? Here I need... I need a country career. 
 Well, not a career but I want a hobby that makes money and in time, makes me the most important person in the region. 
 And it will happen. 
 Uh, just wait one second. 
 Um, I just want to give you something. 
 What's this? 
 (Giggles) 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh, my God, you're engaged. 
 Just first... just open the envelopes. 
 (Giggles) 
 You are engaged. 
 Oh, my God. 
 We're getting married. 
 Oh, my Lord! Congratulations. 
 We're getting married! 
 Uh... are you pregnant? 
 No. 
 You asked me that exact question last time I told you I was engaged. 
 Which was not a million years ago, now, was it? 
 You've been getting engaged every five minutes. 
 Dolly! 
 That's crude. 
 If you're not pregnant, then why the hurry? 
 Peter, you answer that. 
 What answer do you want me to... 
 We love each other. It's... 
 Yeah, we do. 
 OK, wait. This is you we're talking about. You and marriage. 
 It's not a game, Kitty. 
 And that gushy burst of love emotion wears off and there you are -- married. Whoops. 
 (Laughs) That's... 
 Sorry. 
 You're ganging up on her a bit, don't you think? 
 Peter, promise me she hasn't pressured you into this. 
 No. Getting married was my idea. 
 Why are you all so against this? 
 You're racing to get married. Skeet and Anna have just had a baby. 
 Am I the only one who thinks this isn't just a coincidence? 
 Tell you right now, it's got nothing to do with it. 
 This is exactly why we waited 2.5 months before we told you because I knew this is what you'd say. 
 I've been holding it in, not wearing my beautiful engagement ring. 
 We love both of you. 
 I know what this is. 
 You're cynical about marriage and you're trying to infect us. 
 Well, we are betrothed and I'm going to walk down the aisle at St Anne's and marry this man. 
 I'd like you all to be there but I'm going to do it if I have your blessing or not. 
 Right? 
 Well said, Kitty-Kat. 
 Bit of shush from you. 
 And that's me shushed. 
 Peter. 
 Is she eating? 
 I'm right here! You can ask me. 
 She binges when you're not looking. 
 You have to check your bins. 
 Just stop! 
 (Breathes heavily) 
 You're always saying that you want to help me and that you want what's best for me but really, you're just keeping me frozen as my past self because that's convenient for you. 
 Well, you have to let me grow up. 
 It's like... they see me happy and straightaway, they think, 'Oh, she's going to crash.' 
 You're not saying anything. 
 They've got to you, haven't they? You're having doubts. 
 No, no. 
 Peter, no! 
 I'm not having doubts, not about that. 
 It's just... 
 (Sighs) 
 I don't want to get married at St Anne's. 
 My whole family's got married there. 
 Mm. 
 My ancestors built it. Generations of Ballantynes. 
 OK, but it's our wedding and... 
 (Sighs) Religion! 
 My whole life... I've known that one day, I'd get married at St Anne's. 
 I-I don't... believe the things I'd need to believe. 
 You don't need to believe anything! 
 Well, you kind of do. It'd be dishonest to pretend I did. 
 I don't want a lie at the centre of our marriage. 
 It's a building, a venue. 
 Just think of it as participating in a sweet, quaint... family tradition. 
 Dolly and Kingsley asked me to be godfather to Riley and I said no. 
 OK? I can't say no to them and yes to you. 
 Yes, you can, because you love me. 
 I'm not getting married there. 
 (Gasps) 
 I'm on the verge of a tantrum. 
 OK. 
 I want you to recognise that I'm exercising a high level of self-control right now. 
 I do recognise that. 
 Wait. 
 Could we try to solve our problems with s*x? 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 Come on. 
 (Groans) 
 Yes! 
 (Grunts) 
 Yes! 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 Yeah, I feel better now. Do you? 
 Yeah. 
 You want our wedding to be about us, not about religion. 
 Yeah. 
 And really, I just want to wear a great dress... and exchange rings. 
 I just want us to have matching rings. 
 And a party. 
 And that's what a wedding is, right? 
 Just a big party with us in the middle. 
 Well, let's just have a big party with us in the middle. 
 Let's have a not-wedding. 
 No traditions. 
 You looking great, me in a great dress. 
 OK. 
 And everyone in white! 
 OK. 
 Problem? 
 (Laughs) Ah, no. No. 
 Saying our lives are joined together now, from this moment till the end of time. 
 Surrounded by our tribe. 
 So even your brother and his scary girlfriend? 
 Yeah. 
 Hello. 
 She's gone back to sleep. 
 (Sighs) So have I. 
 I haven't. 
 And I thought you might want to... 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. It's been awhile. 
 (Sighs) I missed you. 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 Ignore it. 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 Ohh! 
 Are you expecting anyone? 
 Your divorce papers. 
 You think? 
 (Laughs) 
 No... 
 Yes. 
 Two years ago, Nature's Wellness took me out to lunch, romanced me to be the face of their vitamins. 
 Now they send me flowers to tell me they've dumped me. 
 Any reason? 
 Well, I'm damaged goods, a home wrecker, so... 
 Plus, you got busted for drugs. 
 Yeah. In the news for all the wrong reasons. 
 Do you need the money? 
 No, I'm not at that stage yet. 
 That's the other thing -- Xander. 
 He keeps telling me the divorce papers are in the mail but they've never arrived. 
 I keep thinking there's going to be a breakthrough moment where it'll all be civil, but Xander is... 
 Hey, Xander's being a dick, Anna. 
 You've got to put up some fight. - How? 
 Break in and abduct my son? 
 No. 
 If Xander's gonna run interference, then you just gotta work around him. 
 Look, we're hosting a party. 
 Everybody's coming. You should come too. 
 What's the occasion? 
 Ah, it's just a party. 
 You know, for Peter and Kitty -- they're sort of... celebrating their... relationship or something. 
 That... that sounds like a wedding. 
 What? No! No, no, no, no. 
 No, it's nothing like that. There's no legal thing. 
 There's not even a celebrant -- Dolly's doing it, I mean... 
 Look, it's a family thing and you're my sister, so... 
 I haven't been invited. 
 Come anyway. 
 I can't! 
 Yeah, you can. (Laughs) 
 You think? 
 Yeah! 
 Yes! 
 Everybody being shitty with you has gone on and on and on. 
 I mean, it all worked out, didn't it? 
 I don't want to make things difficult for Dolly or Kitty. 
 You wouldn't be. It wouldn't be a big deal. 
 Kasper's going to be there. You want to see Kasper. 
 Come. 
 Nick : Stop the car, Peter Pants! Stop here. 
 This is your big surprise. This is all you could think of? 
 (Laughs) 
 You know, we're not 15 anymore. There are pubs. 
 Come on! Life is for living, you silly fool. 
 Come, follow! 
 Where's the esky? 
 Ahh! 
 This is a very special place. 
 Yeah, Dolly brought me here the first time we visited her parents. 
 Yeah. Dolly brought all the boys here. 
 Really? 
 (Laughs) I suppose I should have guessed that. 
 I used to come here alone. A lot. 
 Have a bit of a wank. 
 (Laughs) 
 Right here. 
 Good to know. 
 Small town, small minds, but here... here, anything was possible. 
 (Both laugh) 
 Hey, presto. What do we have here? 
 This is a concoction of my own devising. 
 Oh, yes? 
 Well, I haven't named it yet. 
 (Sniffs) Got a bit of champagne in it and some fruit. 
 Do you like fruit? 
 I love fruit. 
 Enjoy. 
 Bang on. 
 Oh, frag! 
 (Coughs) I am simultaneously delighted and horrified. 
 (Laughs) So, Phillip... 
 You're part of this buck's do, so you'd better... 
 No, it's not a buck's do. 
 A last hurrah? 
 A buck's night would be somewhere I chose. 
 Of course. 
 Drink up. 
 Bottoms up. 
 Mm... my Peter! 
 My darling, darling Peter, my... 
 Mmm... 
 What are you... 
 Tomorrow, you're going to be all growed up, huh? 
 Stop it. 
 Come here! 
 Arrgh! - I just want to see if your face... if forced, will form some sort of a smile. 
 Come on! Yes, no? 
 No. 
 Whatever. (Coughs) 
 What's in this? 
 It's a secret ingredient. 
 (Laughs) Why is it making my teeth numb? 
 (Both laugh) 
 OK, ladies! 
 Wait, wait, wait! 
 Oh! 
 It's good. - Wow. - What's this? 
 (Laughs) And here for you, Kitty darling! 
 Here's cheers. 
 All : Cheers! 
 Yay! 
 So, how did you and Peter meet? 
 Family friends. We all used to have baths together. 
 (Giggles) 
 Hot! 
 Well, we were children, so... 
 Kingsley and I got together at Peter's 21st. 
 Kingsley had a pill and we all went skinny-dipping in the dam. 
 Mm! And you and Dad... 
 Oh! 
 Aw... 
 Oh, what, what? 
 Go, tell it, tell it. 
 Well, it was a fancy-dress party at uni. 
 Come as your favourite food. 
 I came as a strawberry and Phillip went as whipped cream. 
 Ooh, it was meant to be! 
 That is so romantic! 
 So how did you and Nick meet, Crystal? 
 Having a four-way. 
 Oh. Lovely. 
 You had to ask. 
 Look, I was being polite. 
 Somebody's got to be but you two... 
 Do you think she's going to ruin tomorrow? 
 I'm gonna say, probably, yes. 
 Four-way? We used to just call them orgies. 
 Argh! Oh, I love you! 
 (Laughs) 
 What are you doing? 
 (Phone beeps) 
 Wait a second. Stop it, please! 
 (Laughs) 
 I'd better take this. 
 (Sighs) 
 Ah! 
 (Laughs) 
 My baby, you rock my world! 
 Peter. 
 Peter... 
 Are you there? 
 Where are you, Mister Mister? 
 I've always been in love with ideas. 
 Not things. Things, things always disappoint me. 
 Oh! Here we go. 
 This is classic Peter Pumpkin Eater. 
 No! 
 No, I should have known. 
 I should have written it down that you'd become the brooding doubt monster. 
 What are you doing? 
 Nothing. Shut up. 
 What's the matter, mate? 
 I imagine the future, you know, how great it's going to be. 
 And then when it comes, it's not how I thought. 
 I often don't like it. 
 Am I the type of person who should be... 
 What? I don't understand what you're saying. 
 Just make a decision and stick to it. 
 What's going on? 
 Maybe it's not fair to make Kitty marry someone like me. 
 (Laughs) 
 No. 
 You're just afraid you'll stop loving her. 
 It's the night before your wedding. That's natural. 
 I'd have my 25-year-old body back in a second... you know, but the rest of it... 
 Dolly and Kitty are my daughters, right? 
 I married their mother. 
 But... frankly, if she wasn't around... I'd be, I'd be sitting alone in a room full of newspapers. 
 Peter. 
 The best, best, best thing that you can do is find a woman who, no matter what, will always be the most interesting woman in the room. 
 Yes, there'll be other women who can turn your head. 
 Younger ones, older ones, slimmer ones, even fatter ones. 
 But... the one who, even at her worst... is still exciting... the one who never gets boring... that's the one. 
 In the end, the words... 
 The words have got to mean something. 
 What words? 
 What? 
 You just said the words had to mean something. 
 Did I? 
 Yes. 
 When? 
 (Laughs) 
 Can you be serious for one second? Hey, hey. Listen to me. 
 If vaginas could speak, what would they say? 
 (Laughs) 
 Hello! Hello... 
 What language would they speak? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Coughs) 
 
 
 
 Peter! 
 Dolly? 
 (Mumbles) No... 
 It's just me. 
 No! 
 You're not supposed to see me the night before. 
 I know, but I had to come and check you were OK... and that we're OK. 
 We're OK, aren't we? 
 Are we OK? 
 Are you drunk? 
 Little bit. 
 You smell like fire. 
 I'm glad I came to see you. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 (Laughs) 
 We're OK, aren't we? 
 Yeah. Of course we're OK. 
 We're OK. 
 You can't stay. 
 (Birdsong) 
 It goes on this chair. 
 Oh, thank you, Riley. 
 Oh! Thank you. 
 Come on, let's go inside. 
 Where? 
 Do not go today. 
 I need to see my boy. 
 Somebody's got to take the first step to reunite things. 
 There's just going to be a lot of people there that won't appreciate you turning up. 
 I don't want you to get hurt. 
 I don't want anyone to be cruel to you. Please! 
 Don't go. 
 Please? 
 For me? 
 Alright. 
 For you. 
 Thank you. 
 Some advice -- don't put pressure on today to be the most perfect day ever, it's gonna go by so fast. 
 OK. 
 Let's do it. 
 OK. 
 You look good. 
 Excuse me, everyone, the not bride and groom. 
 (Cheering and clapping) 
 Oh, she looks beautiful! 
 Man : Congratulations, Petey. 
 (Muffled cheering and applause) 
 Shall we go in? 
 Because it is a not-wedding, instead of vows and pledges, we are doing a rite of promise. 
 Can everyone hold hands, please? 
 Don't be shy. We're all friends here. Hold hands. 
 And form two circles, if we can, and we wanna have Peter and Kitty right here in the middle. 
 And now we will make a whirlpool around them. 
 I can feel my old life ending and my new one beginning. 
 Yeah? 
 We come together today to witness and celebrate the love between Peter and Kitty. 
 Today, they are making a promise which is not legally binding but it is an important... 
 Woman : (Whispers) Is that Anna? 
 Mum's here. 
 Yeah, but no, wait. 
 Hi! 
 Anna. Hello. 
 (Whispering) 
 Hi. 
 Congratulations, Kitty. 
 W-what a wonderful day, huh? 
 (Whispering) 
 Uh, how... how are you? 
 Good! 
 Um... 
 I mean... 
 Everyone's in white. Wow! I wish I'd known. I would... 
 Kasper. Kasper, hi! 
 Hi, darling. 
 This is not what I want. 
 Dolly? 
 Yes. 
 Get rid of her. 
 (Whispering) 
 Hey! Hey. Hey... 
 You got a kiss for Mummy? 
 Anna! Hey, hey, hey! 
 You OK? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah, I'm... Xander! 
 OK. 
 (Whispering) 
 Hey. I'll take her, shall I? 
 Yes. Oh, thanks. 
 You don't have to go to her if you don't want to. It's totally up to you. 
 Kasper! 
 You look so handsome. 
 I think you're the handsomest here. 
 Have you got a hug for me, sweetheart? 
 I'd like that. 
 No! 
 I don't like you. I hate you! 
 Kasper. 
 No, no! (Cries) 
 Darling! 
 Let me go! 
 I... Kasper! 
 Let me go! 
 What are you doing? 
 He wanted to come to me but you stopped him! 
 No. 
 Just stop getting in the way! 
 Do you even care what you've done to him? 
 It's not... It's you, Xander. You're the one. 
 You're the one who won't let him come to me or let me see him. 
 No, I won't, not when you're off your face! 
 He's my child. 
 He's my child! 
 No, don't! 
 Just stay here! 
 Please. 
 Can you give me the baby, please? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 (Keys jingle) 
 Uh, no, Anna. No driving. 
 Just let me go! 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Don't! 
 I'm just trying to help! 
 Give me the keys. 
 No! I'm... 
 I won't hate her. I won't let her spoil my day. 
 No. Good, good. 
 (Breathes shakily) 
 I ran out of the room. 
 Do you think I can go back in, or is that it? 
 No, you can go back in! It might be a little bit embarrassing. 
 But I... I didn't do anything wrong, did I? 
 No, no. 
 Of course not. 
 Do you think we can do the circly thing again? 
 Yes. 
 OK. 
 (Muffled cheering and clapping) 
 (Retches) 
 You gonna do it or just dry-retch a few times? 
 f*ck off. 
 (Laughs) 
 Why did you make me come here? You're so stupid! 
 You wanted this to happen. 
 No, I didn't. 
 Yes, you did. 
 Because you're all against me. 
 Anna, we are not. 
 You get away with everything just because you're a man. 
 You just have to hold the baby and everyone says, 'Oh, wow, what a great dad.' 
 People expect so little of you. 
 Yeah, and I still disappoint everybody. 
 It's my downfall. 
 Yours is, you're never satisfied. 
 (Glass clinks) 
 Everyone's got a drink on them? 
 Um... (Clears throat) 
 I just wanted to start by thanking everybody for coming here today despite that we had bit of a... a false start... earlier. 
 I guess our relationship, actually, had a bit of a false start. 
 Um... didn't it? 
 Kitty was engaged to... another. 
 But we're here... now. 
 Um, there used to be a lot of jokes, actually, that Dolly... Dolly and I would end up together one day, but um... Dolly wasn't really right for me. 
 (Clears throat) I wish... my parents, our parents... could have been here to see... to see all this. 
 Some of you may not be aware but they were killed several years ago in a car accident. 
 (Mouths words) 
 I might just leave it there. 
 I think, um, what Peter's trying to say, that, um... we're... really lucky to have you all here to witness and support us, and in the future, we hope that you can be friends of our relationship, if we ever need reminding. 
 Hear, hear. 
 To the bride and groom. 
 Man : Cheers. 
 Time to face the music. 
 Bye, Viv. See ya, Uncle King. 
 Come on. 
 Thanks, mate. 
 Right, so I'll drive your car home, OK? 
 Oh, no... 
 Congratulations. You've managed to make the whole day about yourselves. 
 Today of all days, my sister should not have to deal with you, or you. 
 It's my family, not Xander's. 
 And now he's poisoning my son's mind against me and all of you are going along with it. 
 When is this going to be over? I have... 
 Come on. 
 I have apol... Leave me alone! 
 I have apologised and apologised but you're locking me out. 
 When will I be punished enough, huh? 
 Come on. 
 Just... 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's not your fault. Come on. 
 So... 
 How'd that go? 
 (Laughs) 
 (Both laugh) 
 Are you screwing Theresa? 
 No. 
 Are you going to? 
 No. 
 Do you want to? 
 Huh. 
 (Laughs) 
 Oh. 
 Oh... 
 It's over. 
 I can't go forward and I can't go back. 
 (Gasping) I've lost my family. 
 No. Honey, you haven't. 
 Hey, it's not all bad. 
 You've got Vivienne and I. We're here. 
 It's alright. I'll be alright. 
 (Up-tempo European folk music) 
 (Kingsley crows) 
 (Laughs) 
 Yes! Yeah! 
 Aww. 
 High five, mate. Winner. 
 Got another champion on your hands there. 
 Xander. 
 I know. Helen. 
 Oh. Hi. 
 Hi. (Laughs) 
 I used to think that I was the centre of the universe. 
 Mm. 
 But I'm not. 
 I'm really not. 
 There's just so much in my life that I don't know. 
 Oh, Kitty. Oh... 
 I'm just crying 'cause I'm so happy. 
 It's like I'm free. 
 Ohh! 
 Where's my wife? 
 Here! That's me! 
 Sit with us. We're having big life discoveries. 
 No, I want to dance with my wife! That's enough talk. 
 (Laughs) 
 Congratulations! 
 Thank you! Thank you very much. 
 I freak you out, don't I? 
 Not necessarily. 
 Oh, I do. That's OK! 
 Why won't Nick marry me? 
 (Nick coughs) 
 (Nick coughs) 
 Are you OK? 
 (Groans) 
 (Retches) 
 Nick! Nick, are you alright? 
 (Groans) 
 (Retches) 
 Are you alright, mate? 
 (Groans) 
 Woman : Get some towels. 
 (Groans) 
 (Coughs) 
 (Sighs) 
 So after all of that, this is it. 
 (Pants) It's the sum total of my life. 
 It's a happy bed, though. 
 Mm. 
 Bedpan too. (Pants) 
 I can't wait. 
 (Sniffs) No, I'm well, thanks. 
 Thank you, Peter. Thanks for asking. 
 The liver tests went well. 
 (Pants) 
 My results are through the roof. 
 I'm three times over the limit. (Coughs) 
 (Coughs and groans) 
 (Pants) 
 As always, you don't know where to stand, you don't know what to do. 
 (Retches and coughs) 
 Just help me. It's not contagious. 
 I'm trying to lift you. 
 Pretend I'm a horse about to cark it. 
 (Groans) You always make everything so f*cking hard! 
 (Groans angrily) 
 Get pissed off with me all you want. - (Coughs) 
 You heard the doctors. You did this to yourself. 
 (Wheezes) 
 You're a coward! 
 I'm dying. 
 You're dead already, on the inside! (Groans) 
 (Sobs) 
 Hey... 
 (Sobs) I can't do this. 
 Yes, you can. 
 (Cries) 
 Hey. 
 (Sobs) 
 This is what you do. 
 (Breathes shakily) 
 (Sighs) 
 (Gulps) 
 OK? 
 Yeah. 
 After the wedding, it's obvious Anna's f*cked. 
 What are we going to do? 
 Not my problem. 
 Oh, come on. What about Kasper? 
 It's not healthy, a child of his age to reject his mother, however angry you both are -- and me too, I'm angry. 
 I'm not angry. Seeing her like that... 
 Not much to win there, is there? 
 Right, and now we've all got to think about the future. 
 I might actually survive this. I think I'm over it. 
 What's this? 
 Divorce settlement. 
 I signed it this morning. 
 Kitty : Anna! Hello. 
 Hey. Congratulations, Kitty. 
 Have you seen this one? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, people will have their fun, Anna, and then they'll get over it. 
 What about everyone else? 
 The family? 
 Um... it'll all blow over... somehow. 
 Or it won't. 
 We all just want to help you. 
 I've had a taste of your help already, Kings. 
 That's why I was there, remember? 
 Yep, OK. 
 I'm fine. 
 No, you're not. 
 You have no idea how I am. 
 Maybe you need a change. 
 Have you thought about moving up near us? 
 There's plenty of space and air. 
 Maybe you should consider it for Kasper. 
 I mean, this place is definitely no place for children. 
 (Voice fades) Things may not be easy in the beginning but Dolly and I will help you. 
 Maybe being there will help deal with the family. 
 (Voice fades) 
 Mm... 
 (Pants) 
 Crystal? 
 (Pants) 
 I'm here, baby. 
 Oh! (Groans) 
 (Pants) 
 When I kissed you, it was the beginning... of the best part of my life. 
 (Pants) 
 (Cries out) 
 Damn it! 
 (Gurgles and grunts) 
 Do you need more? I'll go get your stuff. 
 Ohh! (Pants) 
 It's OK. 
 Peter! (Gulps) 
 Peter. 
 I'm scared. 
 (Whimpers) 
 You don't need to be. 
 What's going to happen to me? 
 What's on the other side? 
 What if there's a hell? 
 (Sobs) 
 What if I'm going to burn? 
 No. 
 (Whimpers) 
 It's not going to be as bad as you think. 
 (Wheezes) 
 It's not going to be bad at all. 
 You won't hurt anymore. 
 (Pants) 
 You've got nothing to be scared of. 
 (Wheezes) 
 OK? 
 (Grunts) 
 Here. 
 (Moans) 
 (Pants) 
 (Gurgles and gulps) 
 PETER! 
 Ohh... 
 (Muffled coughing) 
 Dying takes a long time, doesn't it? 
 You can't keep avoiding him. 
 (Hacking and wheezing) 
 I wish he'd just... shot his arm full of whatever and overdosed. 
 (Muffled crying) 
 It'd be better than this. 
 (Moaning) 
 I can't watch him dying. 
 He's living, actually, just not for much longer. 
 Does he have to be such an arsehole about it? 
 Anyone who's ever lived... ever... dies. 
 This is his turn. 
 It can't be easy. 
 (Sighs) 
 It's our job to help him. 
 Peter! 
 sh1t. 
 Peter! 
 (Sighs) 
 You have to. 
 (Choking) 
 (Door creaks, opens) 
 (Door closes) 
 (Breathing rattles) 
 Nick? Peter's here. 
 (Breath rattles) 
 (Whispers) Hey. 
 (Sobs) 
 (Breath rattles) 
 I've always... 
 I've always been jealous of you. 
 You did everything without thinking anything through. 
 Reckless... popular. 
 I worked so hard to be good all my life. 
 It's been smaller than I would have liked. 
 I mean, you did all the worst things but you've been happy. 
 (Wheezing) 
 You've been braver in your life than I have. 
 We're all a bit lost, aren't we? 
 (Breathes shakily) 
 I mean, there are so many ways it's possible to fail. 
 (Breath rattles) 
 (Sobs) I'm sorry... for not being better. 
 (Gurgles) 
 (Sobs) 
 (Gurgles softly) 
 (Breathing stops) 
 Nick? 
 Nick! 
 (Sobs)

 (Mobile rings) 
 Hello? 
 Anna? It's, um, it's Kitty. 
 Hi. 
 I've been carrying all this sh1t around, being angry with you and trying not to be, and it's exhausting. 
 (Sighs) 
 I forgive you. 
 You do? 
 Yeah. 
 That person that was angry with you, that was the old me. 
 The new me doesn't have that hanging over her. 
 I know you have a lot going on in your life and... I'm not mad at you. 
 I hope that brings you some comfort. 
 Goodbye. 
 Anna : I should have been relieved. 
 My brother isn't here anymore. 
 I don't know what that means. 
 You, though... you were incredible. 
 You just got on with it. 
 Thank you. 
 Tick for me. 
 You're staring at me. 
 I like looking at you. 
 I don't know how to cope with that, though. 
 You don't have to cope with it. I'm just looking. 
 Yeah, but... now I'm thinking, any second, you're going to realise I'm not as good as you thought I was. 
 You're not easy to know. 
 You're like a jungle... with everything tangled and growing close together. 
 In the middle of that jungle, there's a river... with the sunlight sparkling on it. 
 That's what I'm looking at.
