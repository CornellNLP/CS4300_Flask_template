 I wanna live in the country -- you me and the kids -- 
 No distractions. 
 You are the best. 
 Dolly : Gabriela's coming with us to the country. 
 Last weekend, my fiance, he left me at our engagement party in front of everyone I know. 
 Kitty : Peter? 
 He likes you. 
 No, he doesn't! He's like a brother! 
 This is my brother -- the rich one! 
 I'm not rich. 
 Well, that's rich coming from a man who has all my money. 
 Guess what I've got. 
 What? 
 Cocaine. 
 Dolly : Anna? 
 Oh, no! 
 Xander : Hang on. Anna! What's going on? 
 All you seem to worry about is what other people think! 
 Maybe you should too -- it'll be all through the media tomorrow. 
 It'll be front-page news! 
 I love him! 
 (Smash!) 
 You end it or you will regret it, I promise you that. 
 It's over. 
 Hi. 
 Um... 
 The reason I came here tonight is to ask if you think that you and I could ever be more than friends. 
 Um, Peter, um... 
 I wish someone had told you. 
 I'm sorry. I have a boyfriend... a fiance. 
 We're madly in love. We're engaged. 
 To be married, you idiot! 
 (Laughter) 
 She's madly in love! Do you understand? 
 She's engaged and madly in love, but not with you! 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't want you, I want him. 
 She wants me. 
 I could never want you. 
 (Laughter echoes) 
 No-one could ever want you. 
 (Laughter continues) 
 Anna, V.O. : The problem with unrequited love is that you have no say in it. 
 It seems to me the person who cares the least holds all the power. 
 And the person who cares the most has no power at all. 
 What's the matter? 
 I just wanna go to sleep. 
 (Sighs) You hate my pen1s. 
 I don't care about your pen1s. 
 Nothing that happened with Skeet has anything to do with your pen1s. 
 If you love him and you don't want to f*ck me, what are you doing here? 
 Sorry, please, I can't keep talking about this. 
 You're not gonna win. 
 What do you mean 'win'? 
 No, f*ck that! Why should I leave? 
 Go on, get out. You go sleep on the couch. 
 Fine! 
 (Tennis ball pops) 
 Jackson : Stay away from that. 
 (Sighs) 
 Well, she says it's over with him. 
 She's never lied to me before, but she won't touch me. 
 She won't come near me. 
 Why do you think she did it, Xander? 
 She obviously wasn't happy. 
 I mean, our s*x life got predictable. s*x is routine sometimes. 
 I always thought she never liked my pen1s. 
 OK. 
 What does that mean? 
 Do you mean the size? 
 No, not the size. There's nothing wrong with the size. 
 I just... never thought she liked it. 
 Look, the point is, if I let her go, he wins, they're together, and I lose... and that doesn't happen to me. 
 You gotta chill out, Xander. Give her a long leash. 
 You're not gonna get her back by being paranoid and controlling. 
 Play the long game. 
 Exactly. 
 (Skeet grunts) 
 I gotta go. 
 No, stay. Stay. 
 No, I'm meant to be helping my brother move. 
 You know, this is fun and everything, but I do have a bed at my place. 
 The thought of going to yours makes it something else. 
 (Flicks) 
 (Phone vibrates) 
 Hi. 
 Look, I'm not gonna ask where you are. 
 I just wanted to let you know that, from now on, I'm gonna give you all the freedom you need. 
 OK. 
 And another chance. 
 You're handing out chances now? 
 Anna, you're only lashing out 'cause you know you're in the wrong. 
 And that's OK. 
 It is? 
 Yeah. You've had your little fit of passion. 
 I'm sure it must have been... compelling, but it's over. 
 We'll get through this together. 
 We're not gonna let these events wreck our family, are we? 
 'If it's true that there are as many kinds of minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts.' 
 (Chuckles) 
 What are you doing? 
 Nothing. 
 Darling, what are your plans... for the future? 
 We just want to hear what you're thinking. 
 My thinking is you don't have to be so involved. 
 Well, that's your way of saying you have no plans. 
 It's not good for you to spend all day moping around. 
 Can I please just counsel myself through my own problems? 
 Stop babying me. 
 And don't look at each other! You always side with each other! 
 I can't stand it! 
 (Door slams) 
 Told you. 
 Yep. You did. 
 These are nice. 
 Dolly : I don't know what to say to you. I really don't. 
 You sat in my bathroom and said, 'Dolly, marriage is too important to let something ruin it,' and then, wham! 
 Well, none of it was planned. 
 No, it never is! 
 It's so hard, isn't it, to say, 'No, I'm married already.' 
 Is it hard to say that? 
 Kitty is a total mess and you did it to her! 
 I know. You're right. I'm sorry. 
 Maybe it's in your genes, you two. You're both so genital! 
 I'm pretty sure your brother has a s*x addict problem! 
 Everything's gonna be different now. 
 No, you got that right. 
 In the country, you'll get up early and go in the freezing cold to the train station. 
 You've always told me that trains give you a travel stiffy. 
 So, all the way to town, your uncomfortable erection will remind you that you shouldn't have had s*x with Gabriela. 
 You talking about it is giving me a travel stiffy. 
 Ha! Well, too bad. 
 Anna... should I dress more like Gabriela? 
 More, you know, booby? 
 No, Dolly, you shouldn't change anything that you're doing. 
 You're right. 
 (Car approaches) 
 Nick : Ah! You arsehole! 
 Who are you calling 'arsehole'? 
 Hi! 
 Not you, you arsehole. 
 I don't have a suitcase and this bag's broken. 
 Come here and hold me. 
 (Nick laughs) 
 Oh! What's that smell? 
 What smell? 
 Oh! - (Laughs) 
 You've got gut rot, Nick. That's disgusting! 
 (Coughs) 
 This place is nothing like what I imagined. 
 And what did you imagined? 
 You made it sound so rich. 
 This is his medication. Make sure he takes it. 
 What is it? 
 I'll take care of that. 
 You forget it if I don't force you. 
 (Nick coughs) 
 So, there's a whole lot of pills -- there's antibiotics, stuff for his blood pressure... 
 Instructions are in the bag. 
 You're a vet -- you know. 
 Here. Come here, come on. 
 Can I leave it with you and you'll give it to him? 
 (Giggles) 
 I got this. Let's have a drink. 
 Bye! 
 See ya, darling! 
 See ya. 
 (Coughs) 
 Well, Xander thinks that I'm in the grip of madness and that it'll pass. 
 Then we can go back to the way things were. 
 Well, it's not wrong for a man to want to keep his family together. 
 And it's over with, right? 
 You and Skeet? 
 Oh, sh1t. Anna. 
 OK. 
 With Skeet, I feel like I am a starving person who has been given food... and then, when I'm with Xander, I think... I married an abacus. 
 (Laughs) 
 You, of all people, get it, don't you? 
 Mmm, no. No, you're talking way over my head. 
 Well, cheating is cheating. 
 Wrong. 
 So wrong I'm embarrassed for you. 
 Oooh! Because I'm a woman and you're a man? 
 What? No! Nothing to do with that. 
 I was horny. Gabriela was there. 
 We screwed a few times. It meant nothing. 
 That's just flippant. 
 Yeah, I'm a deeply flippant person, Anna. 
 Whereas you, you are deep, you know, you have depth. 
 You've fallen in love with someone. 
 I've got no advice for that. 
 Good chips, eh? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Hey, listen... has Mum ever, um... 
 Well, if Mum... 
 Does she have any new friends? 
 No. 
 Or maybe she's on the phone a lot, you know, when you guys are in the car. 
 She'll be talking to someone and not say who it is? 
 Nah. 
 You play with Mum's phone a bit, don't you? 
 Do you know the PIN code? 
 You know, the numbers that you punch in... to open it so it works? 
 Hey, has Mum had any men over to the house while Daddy's away? 
 Nah. 
 Or has she said the name Skeet before? 
 Have you ever heard the name Skeet? 
 Skeet. 
 (Door closes) 
 Anna : Hello? 
 Mummy! 
 Mm, hello, my darling one. 
 (Kisses) Have you been eating chips? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Have you eaten? 
 Uh... I'll come join you. 
 Here, mate, have a few more. There you go. 
 I need to see your phone. 
 Excuse me? 
 I need to know who you're calling. 
 Why? 
 And texting. 
 What happened to 'I'm giving you all the freedom...' 
 I need to know that I can trust you, OK? 
 Paranoid. 
 I think you want me to be paranoid. 
 I don't. 
 Anna, I don't want to be this guy -- jealous, petty, consumed -- but if you're not gonna show me your phone, I have to assume you've got something to hide. 
 Fine! Here. 
 Nothing to or from Skeet. 
 Well, you're not gonna put him in the phone under 'Skeet', are you? 
 Be under 'Plumbing Supplies' or f*cking 'Gwendolynne'. 
 Your patterns have all changed. 
 'Cause you're keeping tabs on me! 
 You're tormenting me! 
 You're tormenting yourself! 
 You trust me now? 
 (Sighs) 
 Riley : I'm getting wet! 
 Mama! Can I ride on the tractor? 
 No, you cannot. 
 Please? 
 No. 
 Malaka! 
 Hey! Don't use words you don't know the meaning of. 
 Um, here you go. Can you go and play with these? 
 There you go. Can you pop them back up for me? 
 [What have we got?] 
 (Aerosol fizzes) 
 Wait, no, no. No, I don't like using those poisons in the kitchen. 
 Spiders -- I kill them. 
 [Let me see.] 
 Oh, it's red-backs! [Get up!] 
 (Aerosol hisses) 
 (Phone vibrates) 
 (Dryer rumbles) 
 Anna? 
 No, it's, um... it's Xander. 
 Xander. Hi, it's Dolly. 
 Oh. How are you? 
 Good... sort of. 
 No, not really. Why don't you just tell me how you are? 
 Uh, it's quiet. 
 Can everyone just be here, make the place feel alive? 
 Bring the family, stay the night. I'll cook something. 
 Oh, Dolly, that's a really lovely invitation, but... with everything the way it is, you know? 
 Please come and stay the night. 
 We'll drink wine and we'll try and find some normality. 
 We need to stick together, Xander. 
 (Dryer turns off) 
 (Turns dial) 
 Sorry, hang on. 
 (Switch clicks) 
 Um, why do I always get the sh1t versions of things? 
 Um... 
 Like, why is it the second that I get to this house, everything falls apart? 
 There's spiders, the cupboard door opens when you walk past. 
 You walk past it and the door swings open. Why does it do that? 
 Is it the floor or is it the cupboard? 
 I've gotta go. The power's gone out. 
 (Bird cawing) 
 Midori, Chartreuse, and a little bit of bourbon, just to lift it off. 
 It's not quite Christmas in Paris. 
 I call it 'Fisting in Berlin'. 
 Up your bum. 
 Why are you here? 
 Well, you asked me here. 
 Do I need a reason to be here? 
 Well, I can't prescribe you drugs, if that's what you're after. 
 No. I got my own, but thanks. 
 Well, what is it, then? Money? 
 Jesus, Peter. 
 That's it, isn't it? You get money, Nick. 
 I give you money every month... 
 Yeah, I know. My allowance. 
 You need more, do you? How much? 
 You got the farm, Peter. I didn't get that. 
 Yeah, Mum and Dad didn't trust you to look after it. 
 You got an asset that just sits here and makes you money. 
 It doesn't make money, Nick. It eats money. 
 The money I give you is out of my own pocket! 
 Anyway, look... I've had a run of very bad luck. 
 Ah. 
 I forgot to insure the car, and... it got run into by someone. 
 (Laughs mirthlessly) Yeah, yeah, of course it did... 
 No, not 'of course'! It's not 'of course'! 
 This sh1t is happening to me. 
 Look, how much do you need? 
 Do you know what I'm sick of? I'm sick of... getting my pocket money from my little brother. 
 Now, I don't know how the finances work on this place, or what it's worth, but it's gotta be worth a lot. 
 Yeah, if it was sold. 
 Well, I just want my share. 
 What, you want me to cash out the farm? 
 (Phone rings) 
 Hello? 
 Kingsley : Peter, Peter, Peter! 
 Hi, mate. Hi! 
 Um, Dolly's having a bit of a sh1t attack down at the house tonight, um, and I'm still at work, which means I'm probably going to miss the last train home and have to stay in town. 
 OK. 
 Anyway, there's a fuse blown, and she's tried to fix it, but it's dark now. 
 So, would you be an absolute mensch and go around and stop my wife from screaming? 
 Yeah. 
 Grazie, mate. I appreciate it. 
 You're the best and I have to go, because I am in a meeting, so bye-bye! 
 You're an angel! You did it! 
 Oh, God! I could kiss you. 
 But then, I am not the sister you want to kiss. 
 (Sighs) 
 Kitty's doing well. 
 Glad to hear it. 
 You still angry with her? 
 Not angry. 
 She turned me down. I'm over it. 
 I'm getting over it. 
 (Laughs) 
 What? 
 I shouldn't laugh, but come on. 
 Your pride got hurt. Kitty's whole life fell apart. 
 She's the one I feel sorry for. 
 Mmm. 
 I'll be off. 
 (Kisses) 
 I love you! You know I do. 
 Yeah. 
 Darling man. 
 Bye, Dolly! 
 You sure you won't stay? 
 (Door closes) 
 He's gone. 
 Xander : Hey, I was thinking, maybe you should get back out on the court. 
 Pardon? 
 Well, you haven't played in ages. 
 Maybe you need to get back out there. 
 You know, get physical. Channel it into your body. 
 (Phone vibrates) 
 Who's that? 
 Dolly. See? 
 You wanna say hello? 
 No, thank you. 
 Hello. 
 Why aren't we together right now? 
 (Laughs) 
 I'm sure it'll get easier, Dolly. 
 You've only been alone one day. 
 I want you to be here. 
 In my house, in my bed, all the time. 
 You don't know that. 
 Look, I'm gonna have to talk to you later. OK, Dolly? 
 I know we could never be exactly what we were... but... in time, I think we'll forget it ever happened. 
 (Birds trill) 
 (Wind whistles) 
 (Knock at door) 
 Come in. 
 J-Just making sure you were alright. 
 Um... 
 Is this alright with you? You know, coming here. 
 I never asked you how you felt about it. I'm sorry. 
 It is nice here... but, at night, I am little bit scared. 
 Oh, me too. 
 Kingsley's staying in town tonight, and without him here, it's... 
 There are monsters in the dark. 
 What sort of monsters? Do you mean, like, minotaurs? 
 Rapists. 
 Escaped psychopaths. 
 Mmm. 
 People with hooks for hands. 
 Can I sleep in here with you? 
 Yes! 
 I've hidden the car keys in my underpants in case we have to run. 
 I'm sure we won't have to. 
 (Sighs) Thanks. 
 You're so incredible. 
 You're wonderful with the kids and you are patient with me. 
 Please don't leave. Don't ever leave. 
 I don't think I could survive without you. 
 (Shrieks) Oh! Sorry, sorry. It's just a fold in the... It's just a fold in the sheet. I thought it was a spider. 
 It's not. 
 Dolly. 
 Yes? 
 Sorry. 
 What for? 
 Thanks. 
 (Phone camera clicks) 
 (Phone chimes) 
 (Laughs) 
 (Moans) 
 (Bird caws) 
 
 
 
 Xander : I saw him last night. 
 You brought him to the house. 
 Um... 
 Do not apologise! 
 I can't hear you say sorry. 
 I've never wanted to hit you before... but I do now. 
 Do it if you'd feel better. 
 You crossed the line! 
 There is no line... 
 There is a line. 
 And I have moved it for you too many times. 
 I'm not moving it again. 
 I'm pregnant. 
 You are not. 
 Um, we've gotta get packing, um... and get on the road, so go on. 
 What should I pack? 
 I don't know -- socks, undies. 
 Just use your head, OK? 
 I'll come help you in a minute, OK? 
 Packing? 
 I'm taking Kasper to the country. 
 You're not coming. 
 I can't be around you. 
 (Rock music blares in background) 
 Uh... we're having dinner at Dolly's tonight. 
 You're stoned. 
 You wanna join me? 
 Look, um... 
 The lawyer says I'm entitled to more than half the land. 
 (Coughs) Well, on what basis? 
 On the basis I've been paying you out of my own pocket, and the maintenance around here. 
 It's called 'sweat equity'. 
 Well, Mum and Dad left us this place 50-50, so... 
 Yeah, intending for it to provide for both of us equally... 
 Whatever! I mean, I don't want to quibble about percentages with you. 
 Just... I want out. 
 I can't afford to buy your share. 
 Then take out a mortgage. 
 Get it done. 
 Why? 
 Because I'm an adult and I'd like to make my own decisions, please. 
 Mum and Dad didn't want the place to be split up... 
 Mum and Dad are dead, Peter. 
 Mum and Dad are no longer with us, and they have been no longer with us... 
 Why don't you just lease your land... 
 No, I wanna sell, Peter! 
 Look, it's my home! 
 You got some weird primeval attachment to this place. 
 Why now? 
 What's going on? 
 (Sighs) 
 It's just time. 
 Kitty : So, Gabriela's still with you. 
 I had to bring her. 
 I tell you, it hurts to follow through on things. 
 Sometimes I wanna punch her in the tit really hard, instead I hear myself saying, 'Please, I don't know what I'd do without you.' 
 What's that syndrome where prisoners fall in love with their kidnappers? 
 Um, Stockholm syndrome. 
 I've got that... in reverse. 
 You know, she's my prisoner, but I've fallen in love with her. 
 (Laughs) 
 Part of me wants to do her myself. Figure that one out. 
 I'd do it, but I think Kingsley would like it. 
 I don't think I could take back anyone that's cheated on me. 
 Don't you think by forgiving him, you're telling him it's OK to do it again? 
 I haven't forgiven him. Grow up! 
 Defensive. 
 You don't know what it's like. 
 You've never been married, you don't have kids. 
 And how did your last relationship turn out? 
 Yup, you're right. 
 (Gabriela exclaims) 
 God, let me help her! 
 (Gabriela speaks foreign language) 
 That's Peter! 
 I invited him to dinner. 
 You can run, but you can't hide! 
 Dolly : What brings you back to the country, Nick? 
 For the whiskey, mostly. 
 No, I'm actually here to attempt to wrestle my inheritance from my brother Peter's cold, dead hand. 
 Where's Anna tonight? 
 Uh, is there an echo in here? Where's Anna tonight...? 
 She couldn't make it. 
 Trouble in paradise? 
 Bit of rough patch, actually. 
 (Xander sighs) 
 There's someone else. 
 Oopsy-daisy. 
 Mmm. 
 Just forgive her. I'm trying to forgive Kingsley. 
 Yes, by punishing me a lot. 
 (Kingsley and Nick laugh) 
 Yes, well, that's a big part of it. 
 But it's Anna! Anna and Skeet. 
 I mean, they probably haven't even done anything too much. 
 Just a bit of fooling around, like an extended party pash. 
 Mmm. 
 Well, a party pash doesn't get you pregnant. 
 f*ck. 
 I understand what you're going through. Skeet had us both. 
 You're not trying to compare your three-month fling... 
 She wasn't... with my seven-year marriage? 
 There is nothing to compare. 
 You got a crush on someone who disappointed you. 
 That is nothing -- nothing -- compared to what I'm going through! 
 That au pair of yours, she's... she's pretty titsy, isn't she? 
 Jeez, shut up, Nick. 
 (Huffs) 
 Why is it always so f*cking cold in this place? 
 Uh, well, I'd love someone to bring some firewood in. 
 Peter : I'll do it. 
 Oh, see that, Kingsley? 
 Straightaway he volunteers. He's not hopeless, like some men. 
 It is outside... 
 Yeah, I know where it is. 
 Kingsley : For your information, I have delicate laptop hands, and I'm not ashamed of them. 
 I'm a lover, not a fighter. 
 Kitty, can you get another bottle while you're out there, please? 
 Yeah, OK. 
 Do you want some help? 
 Uh, no, I've got it. 
 I'm glad you came tonight. 
 You look different. 
 You look the same. 
 I hope I don't look the same as last time you saw me. 
 I was stupid then. 
 The engagement present that you got me, the lovebirds, the ones from your parents' house. 
 I... I remembered how you liked them, so... I thought you should have them. 
 The engagement didn't work out, so I have them here to give back to you. 
 Oh, keep 'em. They're not mine, they're yours. 
 I gave them to you. 
 So, what, you caught him at it? 
 (Laughs) 
 No, well, not at it, obviously. 
 What do you mean? The guy is cuckolding you in your own house. 
 Why didn't you smash the little prick? 
 What good would that have done? 
 Well, he'd feel better. 
 And the prick would've been smashed. 
 I mean, what, were you afraid he'd hit you back? 
 (Laughs) 
 You know, Xander, I can, um... 
 Well, I'll get him for you, if you want. 
 Sorry? 
 f*ck him up. 
 What, you fight Skeet? 
 No, not personally. I'll get someone else to do it. 
 Someone professional. 
 Like a hit man? 
 Yeah. They do exist. 
 You know where to find one, do you? 
 I'd figure it out. 
 You're so full of sh1t! 
 Do they really exist? 
 Enough, alright? I'm offering. 
 What do you say? 
 (Kingsley and Nick laugh) 
 Dolly : I've got a game! Shush, shush, everyone. I've got a game. 
 Everyone has to say who they'd sleep with if they weren't with their partners. 
 And it has to be someone here at the table. 
 Nick : That is the face of a drunk woman! 
 No, it's not. 
 Because Kingsley slept with Gabriela. That was his choice. 
 And we all know what Peter's choice would be. 
 Does anyone want anything else? Some yoghurt, perhaps, or hemlock. 
 I could kiss Nick right now if I wanted to. You know I could. 
 Yes, no, you could, you could, but I don't think Nick would kiss you. 
 No, I don't... I'm, I'm into it. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Mmm. 
 He felt my boobs once. 
 No, I didn't. 
 You did. 
 Did I? 
 You did! 
 When? 
 I was 13. I still remember it. 
 It was memorable? 
 Yeah, don't act like it wasn't... It was very memorable. 
 No, what she's saying, what you're saying is she remembers it when we're in bed together. 
 She's trying to provoke me. 
 Kiss me now! 
 I've got boobs now. I didn't have them at 13. 
 Go on, kiss me right now. Go on, get up and kiss me. 
 Could I have pudding first? 
 (Nick and Kingsley laugh) 
 Doll, you're embarrassing your guests. 
 Sorry. 
 Maybe later. Maybe later. 
 Sorry, everyone!

 Put it in there. 
 Kitty, why are you refilling his glass? 
 Because it's empty. 
 (Blows a raspberry) 
 How much do you drink, Nick? 
 Well, how much have you got, Xander? 
 He's drunk. Why don't you cut him off? 
 We're all drunk. 
 It's his choice. 
 I thought you would know better, Kitty, than to give an alcoholic more drinks. 
 You're being a bit of a bully. 
 Well, someone needs to be a bully. 
 Maybe just settle down. 
 Am I the only one who thinks this is stupid? 
 It's really none of your business. 
 If Nick has a problem, him not drinking now isn't gonna fix it. 
 It's his choice. If he doesn't have a drink... 
 God, you're like a bunch of spoilt children acting like idiots! 
 Do you realise being an adult means you have to exercise some form of self-control? 
 Why don't you just piss off, mate? 
 I'll put whatever I want in my body whenever I want to, and if you weren't such a dickless killjoy, maybe you'd still have a wife. 
 (Drums on table) 
 (Shouting) 
 Get off me! 
 Hey! Hey, Xander, just... 
 Nick : f*ck! 
 You alright, mate? 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Xander! 
 Oi, oi! 
 Mate, just take it... take... 
 No, no, no! 
 Come on, come on! 
 Back down, back down! Back off! 
 Arghhh! Oh! 
 Argh! 
 Peter : Sorry. 
 Look, what did I do to deserve this? 
 Nothing. 
 You didn't do anything. 
 Dolly : Let's all... 
 Alright, um... 
 (Skeet breathes deeply) 
 I'm pregnant. 
 (Laughs) 
 Oh... 
 You for real? 
 Does this change everything? 
 Probably. Maybe. 
 Yeah, it would. 
 So... 
 Uh... 
 It's totally up to you. 
 You have to make the decision. 
 You mean 'we'. 
 You. 
 No, WE have to make the decision. 
 (Panting) 
 (Breathlessly) f*ck it! 
 (Inhales) 
 Ooh... 
 Kingsley. 
 Hello... 
 I know it's wrong. 
 Mm? 
 But I've had a lot of fun tonight. 
 Mm. 
 I love us. 
 Me too. 
 I want you. God, I want you. 
 Mm! 
 Can I feel your boobs? 
 Just one. 
 (Laughs) 
 (Thunder rumbles) 
 Come on, Kasper. Come on! 
 Kasper! Come on, we're going. 
 To Mummy? 
 No. 
 Mummy's gone. 
 (Door closes, footsteps approaching) 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 I thought you might be hungry. 
 Thanks. 
 I was thinking about last night. 
 I... under-reacted. 
 So, I'm sorry. 
 OK. 
 I didn't want you to feel like I was pressuring you... and I want you to know that I'm... here. 
 100 percent. 
 This is us. 
 Thank you. 
 Woman, on radio : We've had a series of cold days that are only going to turn colder overnight. 
 A storm is brewing in the east and will continue to make its way inland... 
 I stink. 
 I'll settle out the estate... take out a mortgage and get you your money. 
 Thanks. 
 Don't think badly of me. 
 (Snorts) 
 (Inhales and huffs) 
 (Laughs) 
 Huh? 
 Nothing. 
 Anna, V.O. : Love has a beautiful way of making you think everything is going to be OK. 
 But when you're standing in sunshine... 
 (Thunder rumbles) 
 .. it's difficult to imagine that a storm is on its way. 
 Did you want something? 
 I just want to be home. 
 Mama! Mama! 
 Hi! 
 I broke this man by stealing his wife. 
 Now she's breaking me! 
 She's a curse. 
 How many girlfriends have you had? 
 This isn't very good territory to explore. 
 You're the best, you know? 
 (Sighs) 
 (Kisses) The absolute best.
