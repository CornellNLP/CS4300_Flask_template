 Previously on  Game of Silence... 
 Shawn :  You shouldn't have to sell this place. 
 I don't have a choice, Shawn. 
 We want your business. 
 All of it. 
 I'm engaged. 
 Who's the lucky fella? 
 His name is Jackson Brooks. 
 Long way from Quitman. 
 Quitman? 
 Shawn :  This dude killed our brother Boots. This  is what we need to be focused on. 
 (gunshot) 
 (shouts) 
 I got you. 
 Jackson :  When that shipment comes in, we have Terry dead to rights. 
 Ray :  Jessie here is the reason we're gonna win this thing. 
 You make one mistake around Ray Carroll,  he never lets you forget. 
 Jackson :  We did our time,  and then we got out. That is it. 
 I am done with this lying! 
 Just get out! 
 You didn't tell me  you were gonna be in Austin with Ray Carroll alone! 
 It was last-minute. I'm on your side, Gil. 
 I love you, Jessie, but you have no idea what I'm going through. 
 If you understood, then you would stop. 
 Gil!

 Gil, this is getting ridiculous. We need to talk, and I'm not gonna just keep calling you forever. 
 Call me. Bye. 
 Heard y'all hollering at each other last night. 
 Sounded bad. 
 None of your business. 
 Here's some day-olds from the café. 
 Mom, please tell me you'll go outside today. 
 (chuckles) I guess I'll have to, since God forbid I smoke indoors. 
 Anyhow, don't beat yourself up too much, hon. 
 The women in our family always had trouble with men. 
 It's not like that. 
 Mm-hmm. What do you care about Gil, anyhow? 
 Jackson's the one you been pining after. 
 Mom, please, that was, like, a million years ago. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 'Cause I heard you two were getting pretty friendly on his porch the other night. 
 Gil know you were over there? 
 How'd you know about that? 
 His fiancée came by, looking for you. 
 Pretty little thing, isn't she? 
 You know she didn't even know Jackson went to juvie? 
 You told her about that? 
 And she thanked me for it. 
 Poor girl ought to know who she's marrying. 
 What is this, oats on a muffin? 
 No wonder these things didn't sell. 
 Well, I have discussed it with my board, and we're agreed that we would like to hire your firm as our permanent outside counsel. 
 That's fantastic. 
 You're making our job too easy, Diana. 
 Speak for yourself. There wasn't anything easy about it. (chuckles) 
 You're a very lucky man, Mr. Brooks. 
 You have a very talented fiancée. 
 Believe me, she's been out of my league since the day we met. 
 I'm just hoping that she doesn't hold that against me. 
 I didn't want to jinx it, but I already put a team together. 
 (phone buzzes) 
 Aaron : The best and brightest of our associates. 
 I'm so sorry. Something's come up with another client, and I have to get down to the courtroom. 
 You're leaving? 
 It's an emergency. I apologize for the timing, Diana, but when you're on the end of this phone, I promise you I will do the same thing. 
 I look forward to doing business with you. Thanks, Diana. 
 Excuse me. 
 I am so sorry about that. 
 Jackson, what is going on? 
 A multimillion-dollar client just hired our firm. 
 And you and Marina have it covered. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 I'm sorry. I have to go. 
 Ooh, look at this one. This one's not so bad. 
 It's even got a fireplace. 
 Really? With that ratty-ass shag carpeting? 
 Go ahead. Move right back to the '70s. 
 I thought you came here to help. 
 I'm trying. 
 I just want what's best for you and the baby... that's all. 
 Boots was my brother, and I feel a responsibility. 
 Yeah. And I'm a grown woman, Shawn. 
 I can take care of myself. 
 Of course you can. That's not what I meant. 
 Look, Boots sat right here when he told me he was gonna be a father. 
 And you remember him last Thanksgiving, standing over there, making that stupid toast about the Pilgrims? 
 I got a lot of great memories of him in here. 
 So do you. 
 Yeah, and that's exactly why I need to leave. 
 I need a fresh start, someplace that won't remind me of everything I lost everywhere I look. 
 Can't you understand that? 
 I'm sorry, Jackson, I can't believe she did that. 
 I mean, I can because she's my mother, but, you know... 
 It's okay, Jessie. 
 It was bound to come out eventually. 
 Yeah, how'd Marina take it? 
 Uh, well, I'm staying at a hotel for the foreseeable future if that's any indication. 
 Oh, God, I feel terrible. 
 Don't. It was my mistake. I... 
 I didn't tell her about Quitman. I don't blame her for kicking me out. 
 Yeah, well, Gil left yesterday. 
 He's still pissed about me volunteering for Carroll, so he blew up and stormed off. 
 It's just... It's like being around a land mine with him. 
 I just don't really know which way to step. 
 Just give him some time, he'll come around. 
 Yeah, well, I hope so, but look, the reason I texted you... 
 I was at this fund-raiser in Austin yesterday with Carroll... 
 You went to Austin with him? 
 Don't even get me started. 
 The whole thing was completely surreal. 
 There was this guy, one of the guests, Jud Hamm. 
 He had too much to drink, but he implied the only reason that he was donating for Carroll is because he had some kind of leverage over him. From 25 years ago. 
 That's when we were all at Quitman. 
 I know. So I just... 
 I got this really weird vibe from him, that he was trying to warn me of something. 
 He said, "You make one mistake around Carroll, he never lets you forget." 
 What kind of mistake? 
 Well, he wouldn't say. Carroll swooped in and pulled him off before I could ask. But last night I pulled his donor file. Check this out. 
 So, he owns a real estate company now, but back in the '90s, he was on the parole board with Carroll. 
 They're hunting buddies. 
 He's, like, some law-and-order gun nut. 
 He's given him money every year. 
 Even when it's not an election. 
 This is good. This guy knows something. 
 Yeah, I know. So I'm gonna go meet with him in a couple hours for lunch to see what for. 
 Alone? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, no. No. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 You sure about this? 
 Yeah. This is a good lead. 
 We're gonna follow it up. 
 I want you to go home, drop your car off. 
 I'll come pick you up. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 All right. 
 See you in a bit. 
 Bye. 
 No, no, no. 
 Mm. It doesn't make sense. 
 They bust up my house, take out my boy, but they leave my stash behind. 
 You want to explain that to me? 
 I wasn't even here, man. I don't know what happened. I swear. 
 Boy, you better start talking unless you want to end up like your friends over there. 
 Okay. Some-some guy came by the corner yesterday and wanted to talk to the boss. 
 What guy? 
 Some black guy, man. I've never seen him before. 
 He said he knew who took out Cesar and Ramon last week. 
 What's in it for him to take this place? 
 Payback. 
 The same guy who hit our house killed his boy. In-in jail, I think. 
 You think? 
 That's-that's all I know, man. I swear to God. 
 Okay? I won't say a thing. Please. 
 Oh, I know. 
 'Cause if you do, they'll know you're a snitch. 
 And they'll kill you. 
 Give me a break. Stop crying. Get the hell out of here. 
 What kind of gangster are you anyway? Go! 
 (phone beeping) 
 You sure that's a good idea? 
 This is about that guy Boots. 
 Whoever did this, they're friends of his. 
 (beep) 
 (phone ringing) 
 Get rid of that phone. 
 Don't want anything leading back to us. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I may kill my mother. 
 What's wrong? 
 She's driving me crazy. 
 She's hassling me about Gil, asking me about what I'm doing and where I'm going. 
 I do not need her stress right now. 
 I'm just, you know, nervous about all this as is. 
 Don't be nervous, Jessie. You're gonna do great. 
 And I'm gonna be right there with you. 
 I know. 
 And don't worry about your mom. 
 I know better than anyone what she put you through. 
 I'm sorry. I know I haven't seen you in forever. 
 I just didn't know who to call. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 (indistinct shouting, glass shattering) 
 It's good to see you. 
 (sniffles) 
 Are you okay? Did he hurt you? 
 No, no. He's just... He's been drinking all day. 
 (grunts) 
 (man yells) 
 Hey. 
 Come here. 
 (grunts) 
 (grunting) 
 (grunts) 
 Stop it! 
 Get up! 
 Stop it, you're gonna kill him! 
 Stop it, you're gonna kill him! 
 Jessie : Jackson, stop! Stop! 
 (grunting) 
 Stop now, Jackson! 
 Jackson! Jackson! 
 Stop! 
 Oh... 
 Stop! 
 Get out of here. Get out of here! 
 Alice Ann : Stop... 
 Jackson : Don't come back. 
 Mom, Mom, Mom... 
 Don't you touch me! 
 How dare you bring him here?! 
 She's trying to help you. 
 You stay out of this! 
 Randy, baby, please. 
 Don't go, please, don't go, come on... 
 Get away from me. 
 (sobbing): Please don't go. 
 (engine starts) 
 Don't go! 
 You see what you've done? 
 Now he is gone! 
 (sobbing) 
 Come on. 
 Let's go. 
 Been so long since I'd seen you. 
 I don't even know why I called you that night. 
 'Cause you knew I'd be there, no questions asked. 
 (engine starts) 
 All right. 
 Let's do it. 
 (engine revs)

 Hey, gorgeous. 
 Let me get a double shot of your finest Scotch and a, uh, beer chaser. 
 All right, people, let's start this morning off right. 
 Dealer : Hard eight! 
 (whoops) That's what I'm talking about! 
 Yeah! Hey, let's go, people, wake up, let's make some damn money. 
 Diana :  And so now you have met  the first string. 
 I look forward to working with all of you. 
 And feel free to call me anytime. 
 Great. 
 She is gonna be an asset, so take advantage. 
 Just watch those billable hours, okay? 
 (chuckles) 
 (laughter) 
 This is quite a team you've got here. 
 Yeah, they're family. 
 A needy, dysfunctional family. 
 But that's why we get sued a lot. 
 Good for me, I guess. 
 Who is this? 
 My father. 
 He started this company from the kitchen table at his parents' little dairy farm all the way out in Blessing, Texas. 
 And he always said "Family comes first." 
 And to him that meant all his employees. 
 Sounds like you had big shoes to fill. 
 He died just a few years after I graduated from business school. 
 Was very sudden. 
 And it was a big responsibility for me to take over. 
 But the memories that I have of him and everything that he taught me... that is still my greatest motivation. 
 He looks like a very intelligent man. 
 He was. 
 And he told me that all the time. 
 (chuckles) 
 Well, I think that we have earned our lunch, don't you? Come on. 
 I made us a reservation. 
 Oh, great. 
 Shawn : Thank God. I-I'm just trying to be a team player. 
 Annie : (laughs) Okay. 
 I'm gonna go grab the diapers. 
 Okay. You know, I'm gonna drive the baby around so he's not fussing. 
 Yeah, good. 
 Okay. 
 I'll be right back. 
 All right. 
 Hey, little man. So, what do you want to listen to? 
 Little classical, jazz, some hip-hop? 
 All right, we'll go with some jazz. 
 (jazz music starts playing) 
 (siren chirps) 
 You know why I pulled you over? 
 No, I don't, Officer. 
 You exited through an entry. 
 One way into that parking lot. 
 What? I didn't see any sign. 
 License and registration, please. 
 (sighs) 
 It's my friend's car. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Whose baby is that, sir? 
 It's my friend's son. 
 I just dropped her off at the grocery store to get some diapers. 
 Where's the baby's father at? 
 How's that relevant? 
 You're driving a car that's not in your name with a baby that ain't yours. 
 Think that gives me enough cause for suspicion. 
 What, you think, just 'cause I'm black, I go around stealing white people's babies and cars? 
 I'm gonna ask you to step out of the vehicle, please, sir. 
 No, I'm not stepping out of the car. The baby needs his pacifier. 
 Hands where I can see 'em! 
 Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Out of the car. Now. 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 I'm get... I'm getting out. 
 I'm getting out. Whoa... 
 (grunts) 
 You're under arrest. 
 What? 
 Stop resisting! 
 I-I'm not resisting. 
 Stop resisting! 
 I'm not resisting. Sir, I'm not resisting. 
 Stop resisting! 
 I'm not resisting. 
 (handcuffs clicking) 
 Aah, aah! 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 I'm sorry, he's not in his office. 
 All I can do is take a message. 
 It's a client, he says it's an emergency. 
 Where's Jackson? 
 He's not answering his cell. This guy's pretty upset. 
 Which client is it? 
 Someone named Shawn Cook. 
 Put him through to my office. 
 Shawn, it's Marina. 
 And on Saturday Mr. Carroll's hosting a roundtable at The Tower Club for the state delegate convention, so I would love to get you some VIP passes. 
 Well, thank you, but I just don't have the energy level I used to for these things. 
 Send my regrets to Ray. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So you said you knew Mr. Carroll for 25 years? 
 Was that back when he was still the warden at, um, oh, what was that place called? 
 Oh, Quitman. 
 Ms. West, why are you really here? 
 Because I know this has nothing to do with campaign cookouts or roundtable meet and greets. 
 Ray wouldn't waste your talents on that. 
 I'm not sure what you mean. 
 I'm guessing he saw me overserved the other night. 
 So now he wants to make sure I stay in line. 
 Well, I wrote my check just like I always do. 
 I don't want any trouble. 
 I think you have the wrong idea here. 
 And I have to say... you're not the type I'd expect to be doing Ray's dirty work. 
 Dirty work? 
 I'm sorry, is there something I should know here about Mr. Carroll? 
 You must have noticed that Ray has a lot of powerful friends in this state. 
 People in his pocket. 
 Yeah, but doesn't every politician? 
 Not like this. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I really need to be going. 
 Thank you for the steak. 
 What happened? 
 I got nothing. He thinks Carroll sent me to spy here. 
 About what? 
 I don't know. 
 He was talking about all the people Carroll had under his thumb and then he just got spooked and took off, didn't even finish his lunch. 
 Ma'am. 
 Yeah? 
 Gentleman outside paid for you parking. 
 Said, "Have a nice day." 
 Did you valet the car? 
 No. 
 What the hell is Wayside Ranch? 
 I have no idea. 
 Let's go. 
 Okay. 
 Excuse me. My client is being detained here unlawfully. 
 I need to speak to the commanding officer. 
 Leland's still at lunch. 
 I'll do this myself. 
 Oh... Wait, excuse me? 
 Ma'am... Ma'am. Excuse me. 
 Hey, Shawn. 
 Hey, Marina. 
 You got to be kidding me. 
 We're gonna photograph these injuries. 
 I appreciate you coming down. 
 Excuse me. 
 What seems to be the problem here? 
 The problem is my client was arrested on completely made-up charges. 
 I want him released. 
 He's gonna have to wait for the arraignment, just like everybody else. 
 So you're gonna allow this man to sit in jail, bleeding, in a police department well known for the misuse of force at a time when millions of Americans are paying attention to the way white officers are treating black civilians? 
 Ma'am, this isn't a racial issue. 
 Oh, no? 
 I'm gonna subpoena the dash-cam footage. 
 We'll let the public decide what kind of issue this is. 
 So, either way, this is gonna blow up into a media nightmare for this department and this entire town, so either you can sit back and let that happen, or you can release my client and drop these charges. 
 Now. 
 
 
 
 ("Love My Way" by the Psychedelic Furs playing) 
 Do you have a question about your future, sweetie? 
 Where you're headed? 
 Uh, I was just headed to get some nachos, maybe play a little keno. 
 Why? 
 Okay. 
 Hmm. 
 (clears throat) 
 The devil. 
 Ah. Nice. 
 Although, I got to say, you're not the first woman to accuse me of that. 
 Well, the first card represents your past. 
 This is telling me that you suffered badly because of something out of your control, and you're haunted by it even today. 
 Wait, it says all that right there? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Second card. 
 That's your present. 
 Where you are now. 
 The hermit. 
 You're alone. 
 Other people don't understand you. 
 You have to carry your burdens on your own. 
 Third card represents your future destiny. 
 Um... Sweetheart, this is not good. 
 So basically I'm screwed, right? 
 I knew it. 
 My life sucks. 
 My girlfriend's pissed at me. 
 It's all just destiny, though, right? 
 Hey, come have a drink with me. 
 I mean, if I'm gonna go down in flames, I might as well live it up now, right? 
 Oh, it won't be flames; it's worse than that. 
 I'll give you $500 to come have a drink with me right now. 
 I'm flattered, but, uh, those kind of girls, they work outside. 
 Third and Bay Street. 
 Uh, this is not gonna be that kind of party. 
 I just... I just want to hang out. 
 How about a thousand? 
 $1,500? 
 (scoffs) 
 All right, look. 
 Here's $2,000, cash. 
 I will get my purse. 
 Jessie : Okay, so we're gonna ta... uh, merge onto the... 
 Stay left, merge onto the 59 north, and we're gonna go all the way up to the 1961. 
 My God, this place is a haul. 
 Wait, you said... you said left or right? 
 Just go left. 
 Left? 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 Right? 
 Right, right, right, right. 
 (laughing): Sorry. 
 (car honks) 
 Jackson :  Sorry. 
 That's all right... when we wind up in Tallahassee, I'll know who to blame. 
 Hey, I got us the address. 
 You got to... you got to get us to the door. 
 (chuckles) 
 What's wrong with Tallahassee? 
 Never been there before. 
 That's right, we never took that road trip, did we? 
 No, we never did. 
 So how pissed off do you think your mom's gonna be? 
 Who cares? Randy had it coming. 
 Besides, this is awesome. 
 God, I wish we could stay like this forever. 
 Why can't we? 
 Yeah? 
 I'll quit my job, we just go driving across the country. 
 We can go... Where do you want to go? 
 California. 
 California. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 California it is. 
 Jackson : Where are we going? 
 Jessie : California. 
 Where are we going? 
 California! 
 California! Come on! 
 (screaming): California! 
 I'm sick of you and your damn plans. 
 Yesterday, you call me one hour before my train's coming in, you tell me to divert my shipment. 
 Next thing I know, DEA's all over my ass. 
 Just relax, they didn't find anything. 
 I'm under attack here, Warden. 
 Somebody hit my stash house and took out my boy. 
 Terry, what goes on between you and your rivals is not my concern. 
 This wasn't some rival gang, a'ight? 
 I'm smarter than that. 
 Now, I'm asking you... who called the feds? 
 It was Jackson Brooks. 
 That coward-ass son of a bitch... 
 Listen to me. 
 I've got him taken care of. 
 I'm gonna be discussing our options later on tonight. 
 So I don't need you losing your temper. 
 I'm losing my temper. 
 Jackson is not a common street thug. 
 You can't just haul off... 
 I don't care who he is. 
 I'm tired of waiting around on you. 
 I'm-a handle it myself. 
 Terry. 
 Don't touch me. 
 (knocking) 
 All right! 
 I was right. 
 They're starting a war. 
 What? 
 Yeah, those Quitman boys, Jackson Brooks... he tipped the DEA to one of my shipments and I damn near lost it. 
 I need somewhere to store my product. 
 Terry, this is a house of God. 
 This ain't some damn crack den. 
 Exactly. 
 Ain't nobody going to be looking for anything in here. 
 No, no. 
 No way. 
 T... 
 Let's go. Let's go. 
 This isn't a request, little brother. 
 Let's go. 
 I am not going back to prison for you. 
 Nor am I losing my job. 
 Have you lost your damn mind? 
 Dennis! 
 Hey, look. 
 Those boys... they set up Dooley and they got him killed. 
 And they might be coming for you, too. 
 Now, I'm gonna handle it, but if you want me to watch your back, I need you to watch mine. 
 Watch your...? 
 Just be easy. 
 It's just temporary. 
 It'd better be. 
 Annie :  It's outrageous. 
 I just hope you put the fear of God into those cops. 
 It is what it is. 
 Thanks again, Marina. 
 I'm sure you had better things to do than get my ass out of jail. 
 Well, your ass didn't belong in jail. 
 Besides, yelling at people is the best part of my job. 
 This little guy's getting so big, Annie. 
 (chuckles) 
 Ooh! Stinky, too. 
 Think he's trying to impress you. 
 Excuse us. 
 Oh, come here, you stinky boy. 
 Come here, come on. 
 I need to tell you... 
 I know about Quitman. 
 Jackson told you? 
 No. 
 I found out. 
 And I asked him about it. 
 He wouldn't talk. 
 Turned into a fight. 
 I need to know what's going on with you guys. 
 (sighs) Sorry, Marina. 
 I can't get between you and Jackson. 
 I just feel like I don't even know who he is anymore. 
 He's a good man. 
 I can tell you that. 
 As far as Quitman goes, still got my own questions. 
 What do you mean? What kind of questions? 
 Forget it. 
 All right, I... 
 All I'm saying is, sometimes you got to learn to live life without having all the answers. 
 Well, I can't accept that. 
 Honestly, you shouldn't either. 
 I feel like I owe you an apology. 
 What for? 
 When you came to get me after the whole thing with my mom's boyfriend, I just... 
 I shouldn't have forced the issue... at Quitman. 
 Jessie, that was not your fault. 
 We were just having so much fun. 
 And you went to this really dark place and... 
 Yeah, because I was a mess back then. 
 But I didn't know. 
 And after seeing the tape and everything you went through, I just wish I would've left it alone. 
 Randy... 
 Randy did that to you?! 
 (groans) 
 What is wrong with you?! 
 (grunts) 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, I'm so... I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. Oh, my God. 
 What happened to you? 
 What happened to you? 
 What, wa...? 
 Was it Quitman? 
 Was it? 
 It's nothing. 
 I'm gonna get you out of here. 
 Come on. 
 No. 
 You got to trust me. 
 I know it's hard, but you need to talk about it. 
 I can't. 
 Jessie :  Jackson, whatever happened here, it's okay, you can tell me. 
 You got to get it out of your system. 
 Unbelievable. 
 It's Red. 
 He still works here. 
 (groans) 
 What, Jackson? What's going on? 
 What are you doing? 
 Is that a gun? 
 Wait here. 
 Jackson! 
 (gasps) 
 Jessie : Oh, my God. 
 I'm sorry. 
 If I hadn't pushed you to talk, we would've never ended up out there. 
 Nobody made me grab that gun. 
 And if I'd just opened up to you right then, who knows how this would've turned out? 
 I really missed you, you know? 
 I missed you, too. 
 ♪ Come on and do what you came to do... ♪ 
 (both groan) 
 This is awesome. 
 I've never gone boozin' with a psychic before. 
 Oh, I'm not a psychic. 
 I'm an intuitive. 
 What's the difference? 
 Well, I read energy. 
 You know, I channel the subconscious to help people on their journeys. 
 (both laugh) 
 All right, wh-what-what's her energy tell you? 
 Um, desperation. 
 She probably hasn't been laid since Clinton was president. 
 Well, how... what would you tell someone about me? 
 No, okay, look, say there was a girl who was willing to take a chance on my ass. 
 (stammers) Is-is there someone maybe that can fix me? 
 She'd be a fool for trying. 
 I mean, no offense, but I think you're a little past fixing. 
 What are you running from, Gil? 
 Wow, whose place is this? 
 I don't know, but I doubt they're gonna want us snooping around. 
 So, what do we do? 
 We snoop around. 
 Ooh, ooh. Get back, back. 
 Jessie : Oh, my God. 
 This is his place. 
 (groans) 
 We got to move... come on, come on. 
 Waylon, how was the hunt? 
 Well, not as many birds 'cause of the drought. 
 But I reckon I did okay. 
 Ray : Well, I wish I could've joined you. 
 Tell Essie there's, uh, steaks in the freezer if you need them. 
 It's gonna be the regular group. 
 Waylon : All right. 
 (grunts) 
 Waylon, you haven't seen my special humidor lying around, have you? 
 I could've sworn I left my Pádrons in here. 
 Waylon : Right here. 
 Yeah, it's right here. 
 I tucked it out of the way so Mrs. Carroll wouldn't find it. 
 I know how she gets on your case. 
 Ray : You're a good man. 
 We're all entitled to a few vices now and then, aren't we? 
 Waylon : Yes, sir. 
 Ray : Now, you get those birds cleaned up for supper. 
 I'm gonna head in. 
 (door closes) 
 Now they're heading back to the house. 
 You see when he opened this? It's filled with files, photo negatives, film canisters. 
 Well, it's not like he's keeping his family portraits in it. 
 No, exactly, this... 
 No one uses film. This has got to be old. 
 Like Quitman old? 
 We got to get out of here. 
 Come on, it's not opening now. 
 Jackson, we got to get out of here. 
 Jackson, come on. 
 Do you know these people? 
 No. 
 Must be his inner circle. 
 We have to get closer. 
 Come on. 
 Check out that license plate. 
 Jessie : What about it? 
 Jackson : He's a federal judge. 
 Probably retired, but still. 
 We got to see who else is here, come on. 
 Amy. 
 Wait. 
 Shawn, I told you. 
 I don't want to have anything to do with this. 
 Listen, just... I got to know. 
 All those kids at Quitman... why did you save me? 
 (sighs) 
 I saw a lot of kids at Quitman, hard from being in that place, but not you. 
 You were just this sweet, goofy little boy trying to get through it. 
 But you're stronger than you realize. 
 I didn't save you, Shawn. You saved yourself. 
 The night Petey disappeared, you saw the warden get in the van, too. 
 Why didn't you tell us? 
 You working for this man? You protecting him? 
 No, but he warned me back then not to go running my mouth. 
 We found the tornado shelter where he locked kids up. 
 There are initials carved inside. 
 And it made us wonder. 
 Maybe Petey wasn't the only one who disappeared. 
 Am I right? 
 Anybody else go missing? 
 You need to let this go. 
 Just tell me! You can trust me. 
 I mean it! I don't want to see you get hurt. 
 Just go home and leave me be. 
 Amy. 
 (door squeaks open, closes) 
 (panting) 
 (sighs) 
 (sighs) 
 (sighs) 
 (distant chatter) 
 (indistinct chatter and laughter) 
 You recognize anybody? 
 Yeah. A couple of oil men, lobbyists. 
 That guy with the glasses is the chairman of the State Senate Finance Committee. 
 This is like a who's who of Texas power players. 
 Diana : Well, aren't you all gentlemen! 
 So, what's on the menu tonight, Ray? 
 Steak or steak? 
 (laughter) 
 Oh, you got to be kidding me. 
 What? You know her? 
 Yeah, that's Diana Stockman. 
 Who? 
 She's a client at our firm as of this morning. 
 What happened to you boys? 
 Hey, Jessie? 
 Jess? 
 (phone beeps) 
 Hi. This is Jessie.  Leave a message and I'll call you back. 
 Listen, I just want to, um... say that I'm sorry. 
 (laughs) 
 I've been such a... stubborn jackass lately. 
 Uh... I-I know that you were trying to help me. 
 But I guess I just... 
 I didn't think that I could be helped. 
 I don't know. 
 (sighs) 
 Thought I was destined to, um, go down with this thing. 
 Destiny's a joke, and if-if you're still willing to, uh, to help, then I-I'd be the stupidest man alive not to take that deal. 
 I love you, Jessie. 
 And I'm gonna be waiting right here when you come home. 
 All right. 
 (sniffs) 
 (sighs) 
 Senator, I'll see you at the game. 
 Pleasure. 
 Drive safe. 
 Good night now. 
 Well, after all that, I think we can call this election, don't you? 
 Unfortunately, we got a problem. 
 Jackson Brooks isn't going away. 
 If you're referring to that incident with the DEA, I thought you handled that. 
 I did, but my man on the ground's not happy. 
 You mean Terry Bausch? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Fact, I got a mad dog on my hands. 
 Honestly, can you blame him? 
 We've let this go on far too long. 
 We  haven't done anything. 
 Things are escalating, Diana. 
 And I'm telling you to curb your dog. 
 And you don't need to worry about Jackson Brooks. 
 I've had plenty of thorns in my sides in the past and I've always found a way to make them go away. 
 Jackson :  Well, she obviously knows  the warden, but that... that did not look like a campaign thing. 
 No, I agree. 
 I mean, I didn't know who any of those people were. 
 Why do you think she hired your law firm? 
 I have no idea. 
 I mean, this whole thing just got... very weird. 
 ("Undercover Lover" by Majik playing) 
 We should probably call it a night, right? 
 Just check in with Gil and Shawn in the morning. 
 Yeah, good idea. 
 (clears throat) 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Why did you leave me that morning? 
 You never came back. 
 What if we just kept going? 
 I mean, forget California; we could be in Mexico by lunchtime and we could just, we could find a little beach somewhere and... we could start over and forget this ever happened. 
 We can't, Jess. 
 We have to lay low. 
 We have to stay away from each other for now. 
 It's safer this way. 
 I don't want to say good-bye like this. 
 I'm not leaving. 
 I'll call you, I promise. 
 Okay. 
 (sobs quietly) 
 I was scared. 
 Of what? 
 Of hurting you. 
 Dragging you down to where I was. 
 I had so much... so much guilt. 
 And rage. 
 You deserved so much better. 
 (door opens and closes) 
 (keys rattle, purse thumps) 
 Hello? 
 (gasps) 
 (muffled screaming) 
 (alarm whooping) 
 (phone ringing) 
 I'm sorry. 
 Damn phone. 
 (ringing) 
 Jackson : You gotta be kidding me. 
 Jessie : Maybe you should get it. 
 Hello. 
 Woman : Is this Jackson Brooks? 
 Yeah. Yeah, who's this? 
 I'm calling from Vantage Protective Services. 
 The panic button in your house was just activated. 
 Are you at home right now, sir? 
 Uh, uh, no. No, I'm not. 
 Um, my... my fiancée is. 
 Uh, send someone now. Send someone  now. 
 What is it? What's wrong? 
 Uh... I gotta go. 
 I think something's happened to Marina. 
 (door opens and closes)
