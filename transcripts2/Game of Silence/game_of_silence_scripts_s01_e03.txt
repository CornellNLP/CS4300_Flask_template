 Previously on Game of Silence... 
 How you doing, little brother? 
 I just heard about Darryl. 
 What happened? 
 Goes back to Quitman. 
 Quitman? 
 Terry : Those kids from the riot. Little kid Boots, he sees Darryl in the streets, he hits him, so I hit back. 
 Mr. Nolan was represented by a lawyer named Jackson Brooks. 
 Jackson. 
 We build a case, brick by brick, solid as a rock, and then we put 'em away. 
 Bobby, why don't you go on record? 
 We got a witness. 
 He went on camera and he told us everything he saw. 
 Bobby, no! 
 Shawn : He said the last person he saw Petey with was the warden. 
 Bobby : I wish I could've done something else. 
 Bravo. 
 You blamed everybody but yourself. 
 Poor little Bobby, just doing his job! 
 The guy's a liar. 
 How do you know? 'Cause he said he wasn't at the warden's parties. 
 You got somewhere to keep this camera? 
 You gonna leave it with me? 
 Yeah, I'm gonna leave it with you. I trust you. 
 I had some visitors today. 
 Some of those boys from Quitman. 
 I just thought you should know. 
 (siren wailing and dog barking in distance) 
 (beep) 
 I swear, I don't know what happened inside those parties. 
 (beep) 
 I swear, I don't know what happened inside those parties. 
 (beep) 
 I swear, I don't know what happened inside those parties.

 Jackie boy. What up, brah? 
 Yeah, I'm just on my way into court. How you doing? 
 You know me, doing my morning constitutional. 
 Keepin' it right and tight. 
 I'm gonna stop by Protective Services today. 
 I'm gonna see if I can get some answers on Petey after he left Quitman. If we tie this disappearance to the warden, we're one step closer to nailing him for murder. 
 Sounds like a plan. Anything I can do to help? 
 Yeah. You can keep an eye on Gil. 
 Doing this the right way, it's gonna pay off, but it's gonna take a little time, so... 
 He's got to be impatient, right? 
 Hey, don't worry, man. 
 We got a job today. He'll be fine. 
 All right. That's good. I got to go. 
 I'll speak to you later. All right. 
 Ruby : Pass me my cornbread, hon. 
 Dennis : All right. 
 How are things at church? 
 Everything set for the new soup kitchen? 
 It's all good, Ma. 
 The contractor just finished. We will be open for business tomorrow night. 
 May I be excused? 
 I'm meeting Kendra. 
 Yeah, go on, baby. 
 Don't be out too late. 
 What about them Quitman boys? 
 Don't worry about them. 
 Don't worry about it? 
 Man, you got me buggin'. 
 What if Darryl's death was just the beginning? 
 What if they're trying to start some kind of war with us? 
 Calm down. 
 Look, man, those white-bread juvenile delinquents ain't got nothin' on us. 
 I got it handled. 
 Now, if you trust me, you'll be fine. 
 Yeah, I heard that before. 
 Get the money! 
 Come on! I'm trying to! 
 Go get the money! 
 Okay! Okay! 
 Terry, we got to move! 
 Come on... get the money! 
 We have to move! 
 Go! Come on! 
 Hurry! 
 Get the money! Come on! 
 Okay! 
 (sirens wailing) 
 (tires screech) 
 Come on! 
 (doorbell chimes) 
 (tires screeching) 
 Drop the weapon! 
 Hands in the air! 
 Step away from each other! 
 Put your hands up! 
 Put the weapon down! 
 Gun on the ground! 
 Let me see your hands! 
 Come on, come on! Put the gun down now! 
 It's not worth it! 
 Don't move! 
 (officers shouting) 
 Gun on the ground! 
 On the ground! 
 Don't move! 
 Don't move! 
 Get down. 
 Stop. Quit resisting. 
 Terry, no! 
 Terry! Terry! 
 Come on! 
 Aaron : Troy Meyer, former client of mine. 
 Caught throwing bricks off a freeway overpass with his friends, one of which struck and killed a driver. 
 Convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2012 as a minor. 
 They gave him eight years? 
 Yep. Even though I proved at trial it was another kid who threw the fatal brick. 
 Any priors? 
 No. But he turns 19 next week and juvie loses jurisdiction. 
 The D.A. wants to send him to Huntsville to serve out his sentence. 
 So it's a certification hearing. 
 Exactly. I know you have a lot of experience with these. with these. Yeah, I did a bunch when I was D.A. But I-I hate 'em. 
 The state has no right putting kids in adult prison. 
 I agree. That's why I wanted your help. 
 That's his parents. 
 They are not going to be happy to see me. 
 Shall we? 
 Jackson : These hearings, they're pretty straightforward. There's no jury, just a judge. He's gonna make the final decision. 
 I've done a lot of these. I need you to sit at the front, smile. 
 The judge is gonna be watching you, okay? 
 Honey. Honey. Oh, baby.  (crying) 
 You're beautiful. 
 Sit down, okay? 
 How you doing, Troy? 
 I'm sorry, do I know you? 
 Why are you talking to me like I know you? 
 Who the hell is this? 
 Uh, this is Jackson. 
 I'm Marina. Remember Aaron? 
 We're the lawyers who are gonna keep you out of Huntsville, so easy on the attitude. 
 I know you're scared, Troy. That's normal. 
 But we're here to help you, so you need to cooperate and do exactly what we say. 
 Are we clear? 
 Yeah, we're clear. 
 Good man. 
 All right, let's start with your final eval. 
 (click) 
 You weren't gonna leave without saying good-bye, were you, Bobby? 
 So, what do you think? 
 We have got our work cut out for us. 
 I wish he'd stayed out of trouble in juvie. 
 I'm not worried. I mean, he looks a little different now, but there's still a scared little kid in there. 
 Were we meeting the same person? 
 We need to humanize him. 
 The D.A.'s gonna paint him out to be a monster, but that's not who he was when he went in. 
 Juvie did that. Huntsville's gonna make him worse. 
 You sure we should focus on the rehab element? 
 The case law is not very helpful. 
 Gonna handle that in closing. But I want you to take direct. 
 I want you to hit that juvie record head-on. 
 Make sure he tells the judge exactly why he did what he did. 
 All right? 
 Take this. 
 What's this? 
 Have Laurie take his parents over to Culwell's. 
 I want to get him a suit. 
 White shirt, blue tie. We're gonna need it by this afternoon for the hearing. 
 And where are you going? 
 I got to go to the Federal Building on another case. But, guys, we got this. 
 There is no way that kid's going to Huntsville on our watch. 
 All right? I'll be back. 
 (knocking) 
 Pam : Dennis, you in here? 
 Hey, Pam. 
 Another invoice from the contractor on the soup kitchen. 
 90 days past due. 
 All right, I'll take care of it. 
 That's what you said at 60. 
 And the opening's tonight, so I really feel like we need to get... 
 I'm on it, Pam. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 Jessie : Excuse me. 
 Can I help you? 
 Oscar Salcido, Houston PD. I work with Detective Winters. 
 I'm looking for Gil Harris. 
 He's my boyfriend. 
 What are you, um... 
 Well, I was hoping to speak with him. 
 According to the building department, this is his office. 
 Right. Well, he's out on a job. 
 This about Boots? 
 Actually, no. 
 I'm investigating the murder of Darryl Williams. 
 Who? 
 Darryl Williams. Do you know him? 
 No. What would Gil know about that? 
 Do you know where Mr. Harris was, uh, three nights ago, between midnight and 3:00 a.m.? 
 Yeah, he was home. 
 Just like every other night. 
 Okay. 
 Still driving a gray pickup? 
 Yeah. 
 Hmm. 
 Any idea where that job site is today? 
 Uh, yeah, he's on a remodel. 
 It's end of Lakeview Drive out in West U. 
 Yeah. 
 I won't keep you then. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 No problem. 
 Gil  (recorded) : Didn't answer for a reason. 
 So leave a message. 
 Gil, where the hell you at? 
 Demo days, we come to work early. 
 It's time to put up the drywall and you pull a no-show. 
 You don't get down like that. Come on, brah. 
 Get your ass over here. 
 You better have a good reason for being late. 
 (shouts)  What's the matter, Bobby? Not happy to see me? 
 I told you I'm sorry. 
 I know, I know, I know, I know, you're sorry. 
 So you feel better now you cleared your conscience? 
 What do you want? What do you want from me?! 
 I want the truth, Bobby! 
 All of it!  (panting) 
 I told you everything on the tape yesterday. 
 No, no, no, no, no, you didn't. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 No, you didn't. You did not. Not about the warden's parties. 
 Right? What'd you say about the warden's parties, the ones he would throw late at night? 
 I don't know anything about... 
 (shouts) 
 Come on, Bobby. Think, Bobby. 
 Think! It was you! It was you! 
 No. 
 Who'd come get me out of my bed. You'd take me there yourself. 
 Yes. Yes, Bobby. Look at me. 
 (groaning) 
 I blocked a lot of it out because I had to survive. 
 But I know you were there. 
 I never went inside. I never went inside. 
 Stop lying! Come on! Stop lying! 
 Hand to God, I never went inside! 
 Listen, you don't understand. 
 I got a bullet traveled 28 years to get here. 
 (groans) 
 So you either tell me what happened, everything, or I'm gonna blow the left ear Oh, God. out the right side of your brain Please... and leave you for the maggots to find, okay? 
 (crying) 
 What do you think, Bobby? 
 You want to talk? 
 What year was that again? 
 '88. 
 All foster care records for Harris County in 1988. 
 '86, '87, '88. 
 Thank you. 
 No food or liquids near the files. 
 For God's sakes, put 'em back where you found 'em. 
 I got a system here, okay? 
 I appreciate it. Thanks so much. 
 (door opens) 
 (door shuts) 
 No foster transfer... and no death certificate. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Laurie. 
 Can you call the assessor's office, see if Chuck and Lorraine Cooper still live at that address, please? 
 Yeah, no problem. Um, your client Ms. West is waiting in your office. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Sorry, I, uh, I just needed to talk to you and I-I thought if I said I was your client... 
 It's okay, it's okay. What's wrong? 
 Detective Winters is what's wrong. 
 Her partner came by looking for Gil, wanting to talk to him about the murder of some guy named Darryl Williams. 
 Who the hell is that? 
 It's fine, calm down. Darryl Williams is the guy Boots attacked, okay? 
 What does Gil have to do with that? 
 I don't know. Did you ask him? 
 Yes. I've been calling him all morning, He's not answering, so I'm worried. What, does he need a lawyer? 
 No, of course not, no. I'm sure he doesn't have anything to do with it, Jessie. It's fine. 
 Okay? 
 Then what's going on? 
 What are you guys up to? 
 We're not up to anything, Jessie. 
 Really? 
 So Boots just beats up some random guy on the street... and then Boots dies, and now Gil's under investigation for the murder of the guy that Boots beat up. 
 Okay, Jes... 
 And I'm just supposed to think that that's a coincidence? 
 Jessie, the cops know we were all friends with Boots. 
 They're just covering their bases. It is fine. 
 There's more to it, and you know it. What aren't you telling me? 
 That's all you need to know, Jessie. 
 That means there's something I do need to know... 
 Why do you keep hiding things from me? 
 Because I'm trying to protect you, Jessie. 
 I'm trying to protect... 
 Trying to protect yours... 
 Hey. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Uh, we had a meeting, but... 
 No, it's fine, it's fine. Come in. Uh, Marina, this is... this is Jessie West. 
 She's an old friend. 
 Great to meet you. 
 Hi. 
 Jessie, this is Marina. She's a partner at the firm and... and my fiancée. 
 Fi-Fiancée? 
 Yeah. 
 Wow.  (laughs) 
 Yeah. 
 That's great. 
 I mean, congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, uh, Jessie just came by, she wanted some legal advice, she's having trouble with her landlord at the café, so... 
 Well, you came to the right guy. I-I have to say, it is so nice to meet an old friend of Jackson's. 
 I was beginning to think his past was one big secret. 
 Well, I'm so sorry, but I have to go. 
 Um, I'll talk to you later. 
 Thank you so much for... 
 Absolutely. 
 Later, yeah. It was really nice meeting you. 
 You, too. Okay. All right, bye. 
 Thanks for dropping by, Jess, thank you. 
 Bye, thank you. 
 What'd you say her name was? 
 Donna Curtis. 
 She's, uh, Petey's... Peter's biological mother. 
 And now after all this time she wants to meet him? 
 Well, I'll be. 
 Yeah. As her attorney, I'm just helping her locate him. The foster care records show that, uh, he lived with you, here, uh, until he went to juvie in 1988. Is that right? 
 Caught him for stealing fireworks. 
 I still think they got the wrong boy. 
 And did he return here after he finished his sentence? 
 Oh, I wish he had. 
 I loved that boy like he was my own. 
 My husband Chuck, God rest his soul, he went up to Quitman to get him after he'd done his time, but he was gone. 
 He was gone... he, uh... he had left before your husband arrived? 
 The warden said he'd been violent during his time there, so the state put him in a special group. 
 Oh, the warden gave us a final payment for all our trouble and Chuck said he wanted that to be the end of it. 
 A final payment from the warden? 
 Mm-hmm, that's what my husband said. 
 Truth is, we had more kids than we could handle back then. 
 So I thought Peter was better off staying in the care of the state. 
 I sure hope he's leading a real nice life now. 
 I'm sure he is. I want to thank you for your time and your hospitality. 
 Thanks so much. 
 I'll be honest, I didn't know the hospital offered a grief counseling service. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm glad you called. 
 The loss of a loved one can be tough to deal with alone. 
 How you holding up? 
 Well... as you can see, not great. 
 I find it helps to talk about the loss. 
 Tell me about your husband. 
 What was he like? 
 (chuckles softly) 
 He was funny. 
 He was... caring. 
 And smart. 
 Loving. 
 At least I thought he was all those things. 
 Well, if you felt that way about him, it must have been true. 
 Then why would he have done something like this? 
 He wasn't violent. He didn't hate. 
 He was a kind man. 
 Good man. 
 Sometimes a good man is... capable of doing a bad thing. 
 (distorted shouting) 
 What's important is that we forgive our loved ones for their sins. 
 That's the problem. 
 I can find a way to forgive Boots. 
 I just don't know if I can ever forgive myself. 
 He picked up an extra shift the day he was arrested. 
 He didn't even want to go to Houston, but I made him. 
 I told him we needed the money for the baby. 
 He'd still be here if it wasn't for me. 
 Man : And most recently, in November of 2015, you got another six weeks in disciplinary seclusion. Is that correct? 
 Yes, sir. 
 And that was for fighting again, too? 
 I guess so. 
 You guess so? 
 Did you or did you not hit another inmate with a metal tray in the cafeteria? 
 Yeah, I hit him. 
 One more question, Mr. Meyer. 
 Is that a 210 gang tattoo on your neck? 
 Doesn't mean anything. 
 Did you become affiliated with a gang while you were incarcerated? 
 No, I did not. 
 So you just liked the way it looked. 
 Objection. Argumentative. 
 Withdrawn. Pass the witness. 
 
 
 
 Marina : You've had a rough time in juvie, haven't you, Troy? 
 Yes. 
 How old were you when you were arrested? 
 I was 14. 
 Had you ever been in trouble with the law before that? 
 No, ma'am. 
 These disciplinary incidents that Mr. Watson mentioned... tell the court about those. 
 (exhales)  Uh... 
 When I, uh, when I first got there, it was like I was immediately a target. 
 You know, all the kids just kept picking on me all the time. That was the whole reason I went to rec in the first place, was to get stronger so that I could protect myself. 
 Did that work? 
 No, they just kept coming. First time, these guys cornered me in my bunk and I was just defending myself. I got seclusion. 
 Second time, they tried stealing my chits and I fought back and boom, I got four weeks for that, so then I-I was done. 
 That's it... then I just... I, um... 
 What? 
 It's okay. 
 Well, the third and fourth times I started the fight. 
 Why would you do that? 
 I don't know. 
 Yes, you do, Troy. 
 Was it because seclusion was the only place they couldn't get to you... the only place that you felt safe? 
 Yeah. 
 And why do you have that tattoo? 
 They said that, uh... if I don't, if I don't let them give it to me... then they're just gonna keep beating me every day. 
 They said that it's worse at Huntsville, and I'm... 
 I'm sorry, Judge, I'm sorry. I don't want to go. 
 I don't want to go to Huntsville. I'm... 
 I don't want to be locked up anymore. 
 Mr. Cook. 
 Detective Salcido, Houston PD. 
 Got a minute? 
 Oh, no worries, bro. I got the building permit around here somewhere, hang on. 
 I just got a few questions for you and your partner regarding Darryl Williams. 
 My partner's not here. 
 We have a witness that placed a gray crew cab pickup truck outside Darryl's home the night he was killed. 
 What does that have to do with us? 
 Well, witness ID'd two men inside... one black, one white. 
 You guys told my partner that you were all home that night. 
 Care to revise that story? 
 Or shall I have a black and white find Mr. Williams, bring him... 
 I get it, I get it, all right? 
 We were there. But we never got out of the truck. 
 Listen, I'm gonna keep it 100% with you. 
 I'm not saying we didn't think about doing something. 
 But we didn't. 
 We sat there for ten minutes and then we left. 
 Went over to Blanco's and had a few beers before they closed. 
 And after that? 
 After that what? 
 G took me to the crib and we called it a night. 
 So it's possible Mr. Harris went back? 
 No, he wouldn't have done that. 
 You seem fairly certain. 
 Yeah, 'cause I know the man. 
 Better than anyone else. 
 We go way back. 
 Woman : I knew this was a mistake. 
 We should turn around and move right back to Atlanta. 
 We've only been here a week. 
 And I have yet to see another black person. 
 Can't even get away from one of the neighbors. 
 Man : So they're not welcoming us with open arms. 
 It takes time. 
 Woman : How much time? How long we gonna keep Shawny locked in here, worried he'll be hurt if he steps outside? 
 Hi, I'm Shawn Cook. 
 And my family and I just moved into the neighborhood, so I thought I'd take this opportunity to introduce myself and make some new friends. 
 Uh, no. 
 Hi, I'm Shawn. My family and I just moved in the neigh... 
 I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. 
 Hi. I'm Shawn. 
 (knocking) 
 Hi. I'm Shawn. 
 I'm new around here. 
 And? 
 And I don't usually get this far. 
 I saw the moving truck. 
 Race car bed's a little much, but, uh... 
 (laughing) 
 You guys got a humongous TV. 
 My name's Gil. 
 You play Nintendo? 
 Hell, yeah, I do. 
 All right, well, look, hurry up before my loser foster mom gets home and makes us stop. 
 Awesome! 
 Bobby : Wasn't like they were held every week or anything. 
 It was just random, you know. 
 Warden'd call me up in the afternoon and... and tell me it was time for one of his special parties, and I knew that meant I had to go and get liquor for everybody. 
 What do you mean ever-everybody? Who-who were those other people? 
 Mostly just the warden's friends. 
 Sometimes I saw other people go in. 
 Bigwigs, you know. 
 Political people. 
 Then what happened? 
 What happened?! 
 Once the party got started, he'd just call me up, tell me to send over some of his favorites. 
 His favorites? 
 Yeah. 
 There were other kids, too. 
 You really don't remember, do you? 
 Oh, God... 
 (sighs) 
 There were pills. 
 In the dorms, we had pills. 
 Wasn't... 
 There wasn't anything I wanted to remember about those nights. 
 Right. 
 I remember that. 
 Yeah, sometimes you'd look kind of... kind of out of it, you know? 
 Warden must have done some twisted things... 
 (groans) 
 ...inside that house. 
 Kind of things that give you night sweats now? 
 Must have been sheer hell. 
 How about that, huh?! 
 (groans) 
 (groans) 
 Don't get behind a trigger you ain't willing to pull, boy! 
 Now we can get the real party started. 
 Hey, sis, you hear anything from him? 
 Jessie : Nothing. 
 Shawn, I'm getting really worried. 
 I mean, should we go out and look for him? 
 You know the man as well as I do. 
 Sometimes he just doesn't want to be found. 
 Well, I'm not... I'm not gonna just sit here and do nothing. 
 Now, listen, I'll tell you what. 
 I'll drive around a bit, stop by some bars. 
 (sighs)  God, I hope he's not drinking himself to death. 
 He just... he came home in a mood last night, and I never found out why, and then... he was even awake in the middle of the night. 
 And I-I don't know. I heard this noise, like he was watching TV or something. 
 Listen, don't worry, all right? 
 I'm sure he's fine. 
 Um, I got to go, but I'll call you once I hear something. 
 Yeah. Bye. 
 Bye. 
 (sighs) 
 (sighs) 
 Not such a big shot now, huh? 
 I gave you little pricks everything you wanted yesterday, but that just wasn't enough. 
 You take a trip and go to hell. 
 A shame your memory's so spotty. 
 Especially when it comes to the warden's little parties. 
 Now that I'm thinking about 'em, I remember 'em real well. 
 I didn't just drop you kids off and walk away. 
 Hell, no, I went inside to join the fun. 
 Yeah, you're damn right. 
 You kids were there so we had something to laugh at. 
 You were monkeys in our cage. 
 You know, the warden used to really light up every time you would come in. 
 And I always thought you kind of liked the attention, you know? 
 I mean, the way you were smiling in all the pictures. 
 Oh, you don't remember that, either? 
 (laughs) 
 Yeah, my old buddy Red... he's an excellent photographer. 
 Took all kinds of pictures of you. 
 My guess is that the warden probably still looks at 'em from time to time, whenever he gets lonely. 
 Does that make you feel nice? 
 Knowing that you're still keeping him company? 
 Yeah? 
 You miss him, don't you? 
 I bet you do. 
 Boom. 
 Ray : Oh, just stop right here. 
 Nick, my friend, I've got some personal business to attend to this afternoon, so I can handle it from here, son. 
 (sighs) 
 (door sensor dings) 
 You have yourself a fine afternoon. 
 Yes, sir. Thank you very much. 
 Jackson : Your Honor, this is a good kid. 
 He did his best to do the right thing inside. 
 He finished his GED. 
 He worked in the prison library, and now he dreams of going to college, just like any one of his peers. 
 And everything else he did was about survival. 
 (yelling) 
 You can blame him for that. 
 Troy wasn't a violent person when he went in. 
 But he will be if you send him to Huntsville, 'cause the reality is, in prison, you're either the perpetrator or you're the victim. 
 And no one should ever have to make that choice, especially not a 19-year-old kid. 
 Troy made a mistake. 
 But he's paid for that mistake. 
 The system has taken his childhood, and that is enough. 
 Don't... take his hope. 
 Don't take his future, 'cause that is not justice. 
 Thank you, Your Honor. 
 Sorry about this, boy, but you ain't got no one to blame but yourself. 
 Can't take the risk of you finding me again. 
 You know something? 
 You kids got everything you deserved. 
 I'll tell the warden you sent him a kiss good-bye. 
 Shawn : G? 
 (grunting) 
 Gil : Stop! 
 Hey, G? 
 (yelling) 
 (gunshot) 
 (three gunshots) 
 They don't have a war with us. 
 You've always been a consistent pain in the ass, but, look, I don't have time for this, D. 
 I'm telling you, Boots wasn't even supposed to be in Houston that day. 
 It was just a coincidence. 
 A coincidence that sent Darryl to the hospital, or did you forget about that? 
 No, I-I didn't forget that. 
 Yeah, they beat the crap out of Darryl, but it wasn't planned. 
 They are not coming for us. 
 You don't have to start a war with them. 
 I didn't start a war with them. 
 They started this. 
 I'm just protecting what's mine. 
 Got to let that go, Terry. 
 We already lost Darryl. 
 You want to be next man down? 
 You want Leesha to go through life without a father?

 Den, now! 
 (mumbling and panting) 
 (sighs heavily) 
 Huh. 
 You know, you're treading on thin ice, little brother, you think I'm gonna let you blame me for your daddy's death. 
 They were coming after you that night. 
 They were coming after both of us. 
 So the fact that your dad is six feet under right now... we share that blame. 
 We were in it together. 
 Yeah, but I got out. 
 That's something you should think about doing. 
 You don't just get out. 
 I let you out. 
 I vouched for you. 
 That's how the game go, brah. 
 What, you think 'cause you said some fancy words, put your head in holy water, something like that, that you're a changed man now? 
 Guess again, bro. 
 We always gonna be the same, D. 
 It's in our souls, man. 
 Wouldn't want to forget my weekly offering for the collection plate. 
 Don't matter where it come from, as long as it do, right? 
 You're welcome.

 Bobby? 
 (doorbell rings) 
 Afternoon, ma'am. 
 Terry Bausch, Bausch Nursery. 
 Here about the broken sprinkler. 
 Huh, I guess I should be paying more attention. 
 You think you can fix it? 
 Yeah, it's actually quite common, ma'am. 
 All you got to do is shut the main valve off. 
 Uh, right. 
 And that would be where? 
 Usually they're along the retaining wall of the property. 
 Sure. 
 Terry : Hmm. 
 No valve out here. You all have a basement? 
 We do. 
 Well, it's probably down there. 
 Okay. 
 Want me to show you? 
 That'd be great. I can do it for you. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 Jackie, what you doing here? 
 I called him from the road. 
 What happened? 
 Consider that a retainer, you're my lawyer. 
 What'd you do, Gil? 
 Shot Bobby. 
 You what? 
 Yeah, I went to go see that son of a bitch, and I shot him, and-and it feels good, Jackie. 
 I don't have any regrets. 
 You-you feel okay? 
 You feel good? 
 Yeah. 
 That's great, man. 
 What, are you insane? 
 What? 
 Cops find out, you go to prison, we all go to prison. 
 Shawn : Jackie, relax. 
 Relax? 
 We ain't stupid, all right? 
 I helped him clean up the place, and we got rid of the body. We're good. 
 You're not stupid, Shawn, you're just an accessory to murder now! 
 No one's gonna find out, Jackie! 
 What are you thinking? You said you had eyes on him. 
 I did! I had his back! 
 That's right, and Shawn saved my ass! 
 If it wasn't for him, I'd be dead! 
 Bobby had a gun to my head, Jackie! 
 That wouldn't have happened if you weren't there in the first place, man. 
 What happened?! 
 We said we were gonna do this right. 
 We were gonna do it by the law. 
 Oh, forget the law! 
 The law didn't help us at Quitman! 
 It's not helping us now! 
 They can't even solve Boots' murder! 
 I trusted you, man, I trusted you. 
 That was my mistake. 
 Ugh, you're still the same, Gil, right? 
 It's all about you. 
 It's all about you. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 What's it supposed to mean? 
 It means you screwed us, all of us. 
 And you think you won some kind of personal battle here. 
 You lost the war for all of us. 
 We still have a confession on camera! 
 Confession? 
 Yeah! 
 From a dead man?! 
 Think about it. 
 That looks like we coerced him into saying something. 
 That ties us to his murder. 
 Did you think about that? 
 Give me the camera. 
 We need to get rid of it right now. 
 Get the damn camera, Gil! 
 I'm getting the camera! 
 It's in the safe! 
 (door opens) 
 Hang-hang on. 
 It's not here. 
 What did you say? 
 Shawn : I saw you put it in. 
 I-I put it in the safe, I swear. 
 But you forgot to lock the door. 
 We never wanted to hurt you. 
 We just thought that if-if you knew what really happened, that... 
 Yeah, but all these years... 
 ...I mean, I always assumed that, you know, it was horrible at Quitman, and I... saw how you guys changed when you got out, and... 
 ...just nothing I ever imagined was as horrible as what I heard on that tape. 
 Look, sis, we got through it together. 
 But why didn't you tell me? 
 Jessie : What, it's not... it's not like I would have felt any differently about you guys, it just would have made me love you more. 
 I mean, for God's sakes, it was my mom who was drunk. 
 The only reason you guys were even there in the first place is because you were protecting me. 
 Jackson : We agreed never to speak about it. 
 It was the only way to get through it. 
 Shawn : And it worked. 
 For a long time. 
 (sighs) 
 Till Boots ran into Darryl. 
 So Darryl's murder was... 
 Gil : No. 
 We had nothing to do with that. 
 But you had something to do with this Bobby Marks guy, right? 
 Was he the first one? 
 Some sort of revenge plot you guys got going? 
 I mean, what's next? 
 There's no next. 
 I'm out. 
 Dennis : The Lord has blessed us as we gather together to celebrate today. 
 This new kitchen will not only provide for the congregation of our good church but will allow us to do God's work throughout the community. 
 (congregation affirms) 
 This truly is a good day. 
 I want to thank you. 
 Thank you all so much for your hard work. 
 Now, let's get cooking. 
 (congregation affirms) 
 Hey, psst. 
 Tough guy to pin down, man. 
 Yeah, you know, man, planning... 
 The rest of my money, Dennis. 
 Otherwise, the stove goes back on the truck. 
 All right, all right, all right, all right. 
 Thanks. 
 See you around. All right, brother. 
 Are you gonna leave me? 
 What? 
 No. 
 I took a man's life today. 
 But I didn't, I didn't go there to kill him. 
 I just needed answers. 
 You know? 
 (sniffles)  Oh, God, there's so much I haven't told you. 
 I don't care, you can tell me anything. 
 Anything, okay? 
 I got you. 
 I want to tell you. 
 Bobby Marks was the guard at Quitman who would come get me out of my bunk late at night. 
 He would... take me to these parties. 
 (beeps) 
 Woman : Hey, sweetie, it's Deb. 
 I'll be at Lola's tonight if you want to join me for a drink. 
 You owe me one. 
 (beeps) 
 Woman 2 : Hey, haven't seen you in a while. 
 Call me back, let me know how you're doing. 
 (beeps) 
 (phone line rings) 
 Hey. 
 It's me, Shawn. 
 Hi. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
 Just wanted to make sure that you're okay. 
 I miss him, too. 
 Marina, I'm home! 
 Baby? 
 Marina : Hey, you. 
 Hey. Congratulations. 
 What for? 
 We won. 
 Judge Harris denied certification. 
 Troy's getting out tomorrow, two years supervised parole. 
 That is amazing. 
 You were awesome in there today. 
 So were you. 
 Do you want to go out to celebrate? 
 No. 
 I just want to be here with you. 
 I want to cook. 
 What? 
 Yeah, I'm gonna cook for you. 
 (laughs) 
 Go have a shower. 
 I'm gonna... I'm gonna whip you up something. 
 What's, uh, what's this? 
 Marina : Uh, the nursery guy left that for you. 
 It's the bid on the landscaping in the backyard. 
 The... the nursery guy? 
 Yeah, he fixed that sprinkler. 
 He had to come in and shut off the water, but it was no big deal. 
 I'm so sorry I didn't notice it. 
 Hey. 
 You seem tired, so why don't we just get takeout and watch a movie or something? 
 Yeah, yeah, takeout sounds great. 
 What's wrong? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 That's-that's not what I thought it was. 
 Takeout is perfect. 
 Go have a shower. 
 I got it. 
 Go.
