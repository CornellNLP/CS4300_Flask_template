 Man :  Sometimes I dreamed about them. Other times it was the smallest of things. The smell of fresh-cut grass. The rhythm of an early morning run. That's when the memories came rushing back. There were four of us. 
 Come on, Boots. 
 Man :  Me and Gil... 
 Is that all you got? This isn't fair! 
 Man :  ...Shawn and little Boots. 
 Shawn, let's go,  we got to catch 'em! 
 Man :  There was also a girl. Jessie. We were all best friends.

 No, I'm not leaving you. 
 You have to. You were never here, okay? 
 Jackson... I'm begging you. 
 Just go. Please leave! 
 Jackson! 
 Go! 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 Jackson :  Our lives would never be the same again. 
 Jackson :  When we were kids, Houston existed only in our imaginations. It's barely 80 miles from Brennan, but to us it seemed like a world away. That's exactly why I went there. I needed to escape my past, forget about what happened, start a new life. It seemed to be working. 
 Marina. 
 I can take it back if you don't like it. 
 There is no way you are taking this back. 
 You are stuck, my friend. 
 What are you doing? 
 Me? 
 Oh, I'm just trying to take your mind off that big wedding I see you planning. 
 (shrieks, laughs) 
 Don't you have to be at work? 
 I do. 
 'Cause you know how your boss hates it when you're late. 
 She's a real pain in my ass. 
 For me, life was good. For Gil and Shawn, it was still a work in progress. 
 A deal is a deal. 
 I want the full $4,500. 
 But the stuff's hot, and it's... 
 (grunts) 
 Gil, Gil! 
 Gil, hey, take it easy. 
 I want my money, Kyle! 
 You'll be all right. Just take this stuff and get out of here. 
 Yo, G, you can't beat up the customers like that. 
 We got a business to run. 
 You don't want your cut? 
 Hell, yeah, I want it. So any time that you put hands on people, you know, that causes a bad look on us, and we can't have that. 
 (engine starts) 
 (horn honks) 
 Jackson :  As for Boots... 
 Coming, I'm coming. 
 ...he was the only one who'd stayed in Brennan. 
 Hey, you. Daddy's got to go to Houston for work today, but I will be home soon, so don't get any idea, okay? 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. Call me later. 
 Yeah, will do. 
 Jackson :  I've always wondered what would've happened if Boots hadn't gotten in the truck that day. But fate, like life, is unpredictable. You never really know where you're going, and you never know who you're gonna meet. 
 (distant thunder rumbles) 
 Hey. This is Darryl. 
 Is he in? 
 Yeah, have him call me back. 
 Cell phone's fine. 
 The hell you looking at? 
 Hey! 
 Get out of my face. 
 (kids screaming distantly) 
 Freak. I will mess you up. 
 (distant screaming continues) 
 Young Boots :  No! No! 
 (boy laughing) 
 Man : How long does it take for a person to drown? 
 Woman : In fresh water, a person loses consciousness within three minutes and dies within seven. 
 So if this were an accident, as the defense claims, and Mr. Cox ran right down to that dock as soon as he heard the splash, he would have had at least seven minutes to rescue his wife? 
 Woman : Yes. 
 Thank you. Pass the witness. 
 According to the toxicology report, on the night she died, Mrs. Cox had a blood alcohol level of .26% and the prescription drug Xanax and Valium in her system, correct? 
 I'm aware. 
 Could she have passed out from all that? 
 I suppose, but we don't know that's how it happened. 
 Well, let me ask you this... one of the reliable signs of drowning at autopsy is the presence of a fine, white froth around the nose and the mouth, correct? 
 Yes. 
 What does that indicate? 
 That the victim was struggling for air. 
 And to be struggling for air, the victim would have to be conscious, right? 
 Yes. 
 Referring you to state's exhibit 14 here... did you find any fine, white froth around the nose and mouth at autopsy? 
 No. 
 So if the victim wasn't struggling for air, surely it's reasonable to conclude that she was unconscious. 
 I can't rule it out. 
 Exactly. And if she was unconscious when she hit that water, how long would it take for her to die? 
 30 to 45 seconds. 
 30 to 45 seconds. 
 That's not much time to make a rescue, is it? 
 My toxicologist was great. 
 He had the whole jury convinced that she must have passed out before she hit the water. 
 Put his report in, rested my case. 
 You didn't put your guy on the stand? 
 Didn't need to. The D.A. didn't prove his case. 
 Guys, come on, I know what I'm doing. 
 I'm gonna win this case. 
 And then you're gonna make me partner. 
 Just because you're sleeping with one of us doesn't make it a lock. 
 Oh! 
 (knocking) 
 Uh, Jackson? Sorry. There's some people here to see you. 
 Jackson :  Who are they? 
 I don't know. 
 What are they doing in my office? 
 I couldn't stop them. 
 What do you mean, you couldn't stop them? 
 I'm sorry. 
 So this is what making it feels like. 
 Gil. Shawn. 
 I can't believe you have a secretary. 
 Legal assistant. 
 Ah. Sorry. 
 You like my chair? 
 It's nice. 
 Look at that suit, though. That's, like, tailor-made. That's not off the rack. 
 How you doing, Shawn? 
 Oh, man. 
 Look at you, Jackie, you just bossin'. 
 Been a long time. 
 Yeah, it has. 
 Come here. (grunts) 
 (laughs) 
 All right. 25 years, man. Unbelievable. 
 So, uh, what are you guys doing in Houston? 
 We live here. You live here? 
 And we need your help with something. 
 It's with Boots. 
 Got arrested this morning. 
 What for? 
 Assault with a deadly weapon. 
 And they got him locked up over at county. He needs a lawyer, we got to get him out ASAP. 
 Guys... I'd really love to help you out, but I'm in the middle of a huge trial. 
 There's no way I can leave right now. 
 Listen, you walked out on us once and we dealt with that, but this isn't about you right now. This is about us. 
 You, me, Shawn and Boots. 
 Yeah, well, I know a lot of good lawyers, all right? 
 I'm gonna refer you to someone who specializes... 
 The guy Boots attacked was Darryl. 
 Darryl from Quitman? 
 Now you get what we're saying. 
 Jackie, Boots was our brother. 
 He doesn't need just any lawyer. 
 He needs you. 
 (monitor beeping rhythmically) 
 You ever seen this guy before? 
 (raspy gasping, labored breathing) 
 Was anybody else with him? 
 (loud coughing) 
 All right. 
 Just take it easy, Darryl. 
 We're gonna find who did this. 
 Don't worry. 
 (breathing loudly) 
 (lock buzzes, latch clicks) 
 Jackson :  Boots, hurry up. 
 (door opens) 
 Thank you. 
 (door closes) 
 Hey, come here. 
 You doing okay? 
 I... I've been better. 
 You don't have to worry. I'm here now. 
 I'm gonna take care of you, okay? 
 (sighs) 
 Where's Gil and Shawn? 
 Outside. 
 We have to talk alone, or it waives attorney-client privilege. 
 Did you say anything to the detectives? 
 No. 
 Good. 
 You have me now, so they're not gonna bother you anymore. 
 I'm gonna speak to the D.A., we're gonna get that arrest report. 
 We're gonna figure out a way to fix this mistake. 
 This wasn't a mistake. 
 You're sitting there acting like you don't know who this was. 
 It was Darryl. 
 I saw him in the street, and I recognized him, and I just... 
 Yeah. 
 I just snapped. 
 And I'm not sorry about it, either. 
 As far as I'm concerned, he had it coming. 
 They all do. 
 Jackson :  The woman we hit didn't die, but there was hell to pay. We each got nine months at one of the worst places on Earth... Quitman. We were like lambs to the slaughter. 
 Man : Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! 
 We ain't got all day! 
 Clothing and shoes and belt in the tray. 
 Personal effects in the bag. 
 Let's hurry it up, ladies. 
 Sir? 
 That's Gil's money. 
 (gasps) 
 Did I ask you to talk? 
 Ain't nothing here that's yours anymore. 
 Don't y'all worry about the warden. 
 He knows how we run things around here. 
 Let's move it, chicken little! 
 Darryl : Hey. 
 Better stop crying. 
 Do that inside, and you're dead meat. 
 (pool balls clink) 
 Shawn : So you really can't tell us what he said? 
 No. 
 You're getting him out, though, right? 
 I don't know. 
 The arraignment's tomorrow. 
 Geez, what-what... what's the hurry? 
 I told you one drink, okay? 
 Shawn : What's...? Jackie, come on, another drink on us. We got it. We got it. 
 Jackson? 
 Jessie. 
 What...? What are you doing here? 
 Gil invited me. 
 I'll go get you a chair. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Gil : Okay, here we go.

 Isn't this amazing? We got the whole gang back together?

 And she's out. 
 She's out. 
 All right, well, now we can talk about it. 
 About what? 
 About what? 
 Time for payback. 
 We're not having this conversation, Gil. 
 The hell we aren't. 
 You know, I say we start with the warden and those sons of bitches Red and Bobby. 
 Bobby's still at Quitman. 
 Terry, Dennis and Eddie are gonna be harder, but that's where you come in. 
 You find them, you get me close to them, and they'll be the next to go. 
 Are you insane? I'm not gonna do that. 
 We need you, Jackie. We need a plan. 
 I'm a lawyer for God sake. 
 Do you even understand what you're asking? 
 We didn't start this, man. They did. 
 You're saying you don't want revenge? 
 You're talking about committing a crime. 
 No, we're talking about justice! 
 Shawn : G. 
 G! 
 You know, for everything that they did to us. 
 The past is the past, Gil. 
 I'm about to get married. 
 Do you think I'm gonna throw that away just so you can...? 
 Did you forget what happened? 
 Yes, I did! 
 So should you. 
 You're lying. 
 You know you remember. 
 That's why you still have the nightmares. 
 That's why your heart aches every time you see a little kid. 
 This thing will haunt you, Jackie. 
 Whatever they did to us in that prison... 
 ...we're still there. 
 And we are never getting out until we do something about it. 
 I said I'd help you out with Boots, and I will, but that is it, you understand? 
 No, Jackie, that's not it. 
 Stay away from me. 
 Both of you. 
 Come on, Jackie, just... 
 Man! 
 We lost him. 
 Shut up. We didn't lose him. 
 How you know? Because he remembered. 
 Hey, hey, can we get some more drinks? 
 Another round. 
 What's your problem? 
 Let it go, G. 
 (groaning) What? Huh? 
 (indistinct shouting) 
 (grunting) 
 Get off him! Gil! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Come on, don't be mad. 
 (sighs) 
 
 
 
 Okay, you want to know why I'm mad at you? 
 Because you invited me for drinks, and you didn't tell me Jackson was gonna be there. 
 I thought you'd like it. 
 You haven't seen him in 25 years. 
 Am I wrong? Have you two been in touch? 
 No. I just... I just think it's strange that, all of a sudden, he's just back in our lives. 
 Well, Jessie, it was one night of drinks. 
 And it was weird. 
 Is something going on? 
 No. 
 He missed us, he reached out, we had a couple drinks. 
 I don't understand why you're upset. 
 I'm upset because you obviously didn't tell him that we were together. 
 Listen, Jackson is my brother. 
 I'm not gonna keep it from him. 
 Okay, so you're gonna tell him? 
 Yeah. 
 When the time is right. 
 Okay. 
 Let me see your hand. 
 You're really an idiot sometimes. 
 What? 
 No, you're right. 
 Terry : Where you think you're going? 
 I have to pee. 
 Terry : The bathroom belongs to me. 
 You want to go, you got to pay. 
 Leave him alone. 
 What you gonna do about it? 
 Hmm? 
 (lock buzzes, latch clicks) 
 What the hell's going on, Terry? 
 Caught him trying to steal my stuff. 
 No, I wasn't! 
 He's lying. 
 Back in your bunks. 
 All of you now! 
 But he has to go to the bathroom. 
 You're gonna be the problem, huh? 
 I didn't do anything! Ugh! 
 What are you doing? 
 Get off me. 
 (Jackson yells)

 (belt continues striking)

 (siren wailing in distance) 
 All right, how did this happen? 
 So far all I know is he stepped outside for a smoke and the guy just jumped him. 
 Darryl said he's never seen him before. 
 Typical Darryl. 
 He's always been weak. 
 Hey, this wasn't his fault. 
 I'm trying to do you a favor here, Warden. 
 If this guy knows enough to come after Darryl, then you might be next. 
 Darryl's an idiot. 
 They don't know crap. 
 Do you even know what he runs for us? 
 The airport, the truckers, the hotel unions... 
 Look, I don't care about all that drug stuff. 
 It's window-dressing. 
 Yeah, well, it sure made you fat and happy over the years. 
 Look, I'm gonna handle it, but this is your problem, too. 
 I need you to help me find out who this guy is working for. 
 How the hell should I know? 
 Because that's what you do. 
 Because that's how this arrangement works. 
 Damn it, Terry, this is the last thing I need right now. 
 I'm getting ready to make my announcement. 
 Your what? 
 They're running me for congress, Jody Miller's seat. 
 Oh, you. Running for congress. 
 What, I guess being lieutenant governor isn't enough fat for you to chew on? 
 I paid my dues. 
 Yeah, and I know how. 
 Is that some kind of a threat? 
 Look, I'm just saying, you and I have been together a long time, and you don't get to pick and choose when we're in business.

 Wow!

 Thank you. 
 This is the bar association dinner, right? 
 It is. Why? 
 Why? Because y-you... really look like you're bringing your A-game, considering it's a bunch of boring lawyers and grumpy old judges.

 The warden, his guards, they all walked out on us. They left us. 
 They said they lost control of E House. 
 They said they were scared for their safety. That was a setup. 
 That was all planned. 
 Who the hell cares? 
 You do! A year later, they sold Quitman to a private company. 
 Guess who ended up vice president. 
 Warden Carroll. 
 Ten years later, guess who's the head of the state parole board. 
 Warden Carroll. 
 They made him lieutenant governor. 
 He is running for congress, for God's sake. 
 You can't just walk up on the street and shoot him. 
 Watch me. 
 The way to get these guys is to expose them for what they did. 
 We get 'em all arrested and they spend the rest of their lives in prison. 
 You don't get it, do you? 
 (scoffs) 
 I'd rather die than have anyone know what happened to us. 
 You don't mean that, Gil. 
 I swear to God, Jackie. 
 Gil... 
 Why not? 
 Gil, look at me. Look at me. 
 I'm your brother. I'm your brother. 
 And I've got you. I've got you. 
 Put it down. 
 Hey. I'm here. I got you. 
 Nobody's perfect. 
 And when we put the past under a microscope, it's-it's easy to second-guess ourselves. 
 Are there things that we did that we regret? 
 Are there things that we didn't do that we-we wish we had? I think the answer's yes for all of us. 
 Because we're human beings. 
 We... we feel. 
 We love. We-we hurt. We cry. But no one really knows  what is truly in our hearts. 
 And that's the problem the State has here. 
 They have the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that my client knowingly and intentionally threw his wife off that dock and watched her drown. 
 But they haven't done that. 
 They haven't even come close. 
 Yes, there was an argument that night. 
 But you know what? 
 People fight all the time. 
 They get angry, and we get upset. But we don't commit murder. Because we're resilient. We're strong, and we just walk away. That is exactly what Frank Cox did. 
 This was nothing more than a terrible, tragic accident. 
 So I ask you to return the only just verdict, which is not guilty. 
 It's time to let this man get on with his life. 
 Aaron :  All right, everybody, listen up. 
 First, to a job well done and a not guilty verdict in  State v. Cox. 
 (applause) And second, to our newest partner. 
 Who will now be working not for but with his future wife. 
 Congratulations,Jackson. 
 Hear, hear! 
 I'm so proud of you. 
 Been looking forward to this day. 
 So impressive. It was a great speech. 
 (phone rings) 
 Succinct and simple. I liked it. 
 Nice. 
 Less is more. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hello? 
 Man : You really don't want to kick this rock. 
 Who is this? 
 You better be careful, Counselor. 
 I don't like people asking questions. 
 I know what you did. 
 Jessie :  Who was on the phone? 
 Jackson :  I have no idea. 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 Nobody knows what happened. 
 Red : What are you gonna do, Jackie?! 
 Well, I sure didn't tell anyone. 
 What the hell is that supposed to mean? 
 (thunder crashes) 
 Jessie, I'm gonna  ask you something, and you have to answer me honestly. 
 Did you tell Gil? 
 No. I mean it. 
 I just... Jackson, I didn't tell him. I... I didn't tell anybody. 
 Not one person in all these years. 
 I don't want... I don't want to go jail. 
 No one's going to jail, Jessie. 
 No one is going to jail. 
 (grunting) 
 Jessie (muffled) : Jackson! 
 Stop! 
 I'm sorry that I got you into this. 
 I'm sorry that I left. 
 (sighs) 
 You can't do this to me. 
 Jessie... 
 I'm just... I'm just tr... 
 I mean it. 
 You got to stay out of my life. 
 Jackson :  There are lies we tell to make ourselves feel better. About who we are. About what we're capable of. 
 Priest : ...this body we commit to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 
 Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. Amen. 
 We all wanted to move on with our lives. To forget what happened to us. 
 Bye, baby. 
 But the past is never the past. 
 Love you. 
 If it were, there would be no tragedy. 
 Detective. 
 What's going on? 
 Darryl Williams died this morning. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 He wasn't in the hospital. He was at home. 
 We found him on his kitchen floor with three bullet holes in his chest. 
 Just wondering if you gentlemen might know anything about that.
