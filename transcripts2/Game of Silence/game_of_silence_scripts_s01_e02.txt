 Previously Game of Silence... 
 We need your help with something. 
 It's with Boots. 
 (grunting) 
 The guy Boots attacked was Darryl. 
 Darryl from Quitman? 
 (grunting, shouting) 
 Boots : He had it coming. 
 They all do. 
 I just think it's strange that Jackson is just back in our lives. 
 Is something going on? 
 Damn it, Terry, this is the last thing I need right now. then you might be next. 
 Have Dooley take care of him. 
 (grunts) 
 (flatlining) 
 You're talking about committing a crime. 
 No, we're talking about justice! 
 Darryl Williams died this morning. 
 Just wondering if you gentlemen might know anything about that. 
 (low, indistinct conversations) 
 (water running) 
 (speaking indistinctly) 
 I already told you. I didn't do it. 
 Yeah. You sure? 'Cause you wanted to. 
 You know what, I wish I had. 
 Darryl deserved it. 
 Damn right. 
 Yeah? And what about you? Where were you? 
 What? 
 Last night, where were you? 
 You serious? I was at home, just like he was. 
 Ah, so you two have talked. 
 For God's sake, Jackie! 
 You know what, instead of accusing us, Yeah, we actually talk. why don't you tell us where you were last night. 
 You seriously asking me that question? 
 Hey, why not? You're the one who said you had a plan. 
 Yeah, I did, but it didn't involve killing anybody. 
 Yeah, Darryl's dead. 
 You know what? I don't care. 
 What I do care about is who killed my best friend and what we're gonna do about it. 
 Don't even start, man. 
 You swore, Jackie. It's payback time. 
 He's right. Hey, what about everything you told me about at the hospital about the warden and that fake-ass riot and Terry Bausch? 
 I told you that to warn you. 
 Look what happened. 
 A man's been been murdered, and now the cops think we did it. 
 Screw the cops. We ain't scared. 
 And you shouldn't be either. 
 Listen, it's time for us to focus on our next move. 
 There is no next move, Shawn. 
 The best thing we can do is just lay low and pray this whole thing goes away. 
 Wait, wait, that's how you really feel? Huh? 
 After we just watched our brother get lowered into a grave not even an hour ago. 
 I can't, I can't, I can't. 
 Why not? 
 'Cause I need some time, Shawn. 
 How much time? 
 Just time, Shawn! 
 I swear to God, Gil, if you lied to me about killing Darryl... 
 How many times you gonna ask me that?! 
 Shawn : If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it. 
 (indistinct police transmission) 
 So, we got no signs of forced entry, no signs of a struggle. 
 Victim was shot three times at close range. 
 I'm guessing he knew the person that shot him. 
 Oscar, I know. I was here this morning. 
 What you got there? 
 This. I found it hidden in the back about an hour ago. 
 It's about 100 grand. 
 Give or take. 
 Did you go through Darryl's phone? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 The guy who attacked him, Gary Nolan, was he on it? 
 What about a Jackson Brooks, Gil Harris, Shawn Cook? 
 No. 
 (baby crying) 
 But I'll run the numbers that don't have names. 
 Last person that Darryl spoke with was, uh, his girlfriend, Mariah Parks. 
 Track her down. Keep checking with the neighbors. 
 Darryl was shot in the middle of the night... somebody heard somethin'. 
 For sure, somebody's gonna be missing that money. 
 The drop is tomorrow, right? 
 Yeah, at the airport. 
 That's why Darryl checked himself out of the hospital. 
 Either of you guys see him after he got out? 
 No. 
 I should've gone to his crib, left him a pie or something. 
 I feel real bad. 
 You saw him, right? 
 Yeah, when he came to pick up the payment, which now belongs to the Houston PD. 
 I got to... cover that now. 
 We can't miss that drop tomorrow. 
 You guys know the runner? 
 The air marshal? Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 I tagged along with Darryl a few times. 
 You go in his place, take Eddie with you. 
 T... what about who killed Darryl? 
 I thought we took care of that with the, uh, Dooley hit in the jailhouse. 
 Yeah, so did I, Eddie. 
 Okay. 
 Let's do this, Eddie. 
 (door opens, closes) 
 Jackson : How you holding up? 
 What was all that out there? 
 We're just having a-a hard time with Boots' death, that's all. 
 You haven't talked to him in 20 years, Jackson. 
 So how long are you planning on sticking around this time? 
 I'm not going anywhere, Jessie. 
 Oh, you've said that to me before. 
 I got it, I got it, I got it. 
 I got it. (grunts) 
 Shawn : 'Bout time, sis. Come on. 
 Let's roll. 
 Jessie : Hey. 
 I think I'm gonna stay. 
 What? 
 Yeah, Annie's parents are going back to Florida tonight, and her sister can't come till tomorrow, so... I'm not gonna just leave her. 
 Well, how we gonna get home? 
 Ride with him. 
 (car alarm chirps) 
 Maybe you guys can talk some more and then not tell me what's going on. 
 'Cause that's always fun.

 (turns off radio) 
 There's something I got to tell you. 
 Me and Jessie are together. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 Okay. 
 Like-like together-together. 
 Toge... I know what "together" means, Gil. 
 Wh... That's it? That's... 
 (chuckles) That's what you wanted to tell? 
 That's it, yeah. Yeah, what? 
 What did I tell you, G? 
 You know, you were all worried about telling him. 
 What for? (stammers) 
 I mean, I don't know. We g... 
 She was... your first thing. 
 Oh, man. 
 And if-if I had a problem with it... 
 I don't... but it's a little late. 
 I'm-I'm engaged. I told you I'm engaged. 
 To a person? 
 Yeah, to a person. 
 Oh, right. Yeah. Right. 
 Her name's Marina. 
 She, uh... she works in my firm. 
 Wow. 
 That's amazing, man. 
 Thanks, man. 
 That's good. 
 Good for you, Jackie. 
 (chuckles) He doesn't mean that. 
 What are you tal... I-I mean it. 
 No. 
 If a man wants to go down that road, then let him go down that road. 
 He thinks you're crazy. 
 He's got a philosophy. 
 Listen... 
 You can tell him. 
 Come on, Shawnie. What do you got? 
 All right, first of all, I think all that's common folk stuff. 
 (laughter) 
 I'm cool with it. 
 Right, right. The reality is the only real reason a man gets married is, one, he gets a chick pregnant. 
 (chuckling) 
 Two is, uh, you know, you fall in love. 
 And neither one of those things I prescribe to. 
 (laughs) 
 That's just not my get down. 
 I don't mess with that. 
 He doesn't get down with love. 
 No. 
 That's just not me. 
 So what's-what's your status then? I'm out here living the good life, you know what I mean? 
 I'm-I'm doing my thing rock star-style, slanging and banging. 
 What about you, Gil? 
 You think you and, uh... you and Jessie might... 
 What, get married? No. No. 
 Yeah. No? 
 I don't know. Jessie's been divorced twice. 
 Jessie has? 
 Yeah. 
 Things haven't always been easy for her. 
 It's not gonna be any easier with you either. 
 What? Wh... 
 Just sayin'. 
 Hey, you can... you can slow down. 
 It's just right up here on the left. 
 (turns off engine) 
 So now what? 
 I'm going home. 
 You know what I mean, Jackie. 
 Boots is dead. 
 Are you with us or not? 
 Hey, baby. Good morning. 
 You had a late night. 
 Yeah, well, it was that, uh, FCC case. I was out in New Braunfels going through contracts with my client all day. 
 New Braunfels? I'm surprised you didn't spend the night. 
 Yeah, well, I thought about it. 
 Then I realized I've got this really hot fiancée sitting at home waiting for me, so I drove. 
 (chuckles) 
 Well, I am late to pick up your mother-in-law. 
 Oh, yeah. Posie waits for no man. 
 We're gonna look at wedding dresses. 
 Would you please come with us? 
 'Cause I don't care about tradition, and it's gonna go forever. 
 I love wedding dresses. You know that, right? 
 I got to take, um, Joe Hart to play golf. 
 But I can... I can bill those hours, all right? 
 Mm-mm. No. 
 But you can thump the hell out of the firm credit card, 'cause Aaron always does. 
 So where are we meeting today? 
 The Four Seasons. 
 Dad reserved us a table on the terrace. 
 Wow. He doesn't mess around. 
 Yeah, they're all over me about this engagement party, and they're expecting names of people that you want to invite. 
 You. 
 Aaron. 
 Julio, from the food truck. 
 Don't. Come on, baby. 
 Baby, he makes a mean burrito. Come on. 
 Just... come up with something, okay? 'Cause... 
 Okay, okay. they're making this a huge deal. 
 And I love it. 
 I love it. 
 Maybe I can take your name when we get married. 
 (chuckles) 
 Posie would have a heart attack. 
 Then let's definitely do it. 
 Oh. (chuckles) 
 I can't wait to be married to you. 
 Me, too. 
 Liz, what are you doing here? 
 Why didn't you tell me you were in juvie? 
 Excuse me? 
 Gil Harris, Shawn Cook, Gary Nolan were all at Quitman in 1988, along with Darryl Williams. 
 Were you there, too? 
 That's none of your business. 
 Actually, it is, seeing as how I'm conducting a murder investigation. 
 Look, I know your record is sealed. 
 You needed a bar card, I get that, but you were there, right? 
 And you knew Darryl. 
 Am I a suspect in this case, Liz? 
 I don't know yet. 
 That's why I want to talk. 
 All right. 
 Well, I'm just gonna tell you this one last time. 
 I was home the night of the murder. 
 So was Gil, so was Shawn, so unless you're here to arrest me, the conversation's over. 
 Counselor. 
 You got a nice house, nice career, a beautiful fiancée. 
 It would be a shame to lose it all. 
 I'm just trying to help. 
 Okay, Liz, you want to help? 
 Then you find out who killed my client in jail and get your damn car out of my driveway, please. 
 So, how you holding up? 
 Must have been pretty tough yesterday. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 This Jackson guy. 
 He wasn't at our wedding, never even heard his name before last week, and then, all of a sudden, he's Boots' lawyer? 
 How do you guys all know him so well? 
 We don't really. 
 I guess it's just one of those things when you grow up together. 
 I, uh, met him and the boys after my mom and I moved here to Brennan. 
 (boys laughing nearby) 
 Jackson : Gil, you need to stop. 
 Gil : I think I got its tail. 
 Jackson : We need to flush it out. 
 Grab that hose and bring it over. 
 Shawn, when I say so, turn it on full blast. 
 You got to let go, dude. 
 You're gonna get wet. (scoffs) 
 Are you kidding? I finally got him. 
 There's no way I'm letting go. 
 Shawn, now! 
 Okay. 
 All right, it's on. 
 Whoa! 
 (animal chittering) 
 Got him. 
 (laughs) 
 Who are you? 
 Jessie. 
 Jackson. Nice to meet you. 
 You, too. 
 What's the matter, you guys scared? 
 (growling) 
 Jessie : And from there, it was just a pretty great summer.

 (music fades) 
 I say we take 'em all down... the warden, Terry, his whole crew... and we do it in the way that no one can deny. 
 We build a case, brick by brick, solid as a rock, and then we put 'em away in prison. 
 It's gonna take forever. 
 Well, that's-that's the only way, Gil. 
 No, it isn't. That's your way. 
 What would you do? 
 I'd set 'em on fire, shoot 'em in the face and go get a bag of tacos. 
 Do you want my help or not? 
 Shawn : All right, Jackie, how do you think we build this case? 
 That's the million dollar question, Shawnie, 'cause everything they did to us, everything is beyond the statue of limitations, so we got to link him to a crime that... that doesn't have a clock on it. 
 Like what? 
 Like murder. 
 That's the only one. 
 What about Petey? 
 (grunts) 
 Okay, go ahead, but be careful. 
 (hissing) 
 Aah! Aah! 
 Aah, that stuff burns. 
 Wash it off. You'll be okay. 
 Stop talking and refill that bucket. 
 (sighs) 
 (groaning softly) 
 (Petey screaming) Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Whoa, whoa. Petey! 
 (screaming) 
 Hey, stay right there! Petey, Petey, are you okay? 
 Shawn : Help him! What are you just standing there for?! 
 You got to help him! 
 Help him! 
 Help him! What are you doing? 
 (screaming) 
 You have to do something! 
 (screaming continues) 
 They took him to the infirmary. 
 Never saw him again after that. 
 I remember. They said that he was transferred, right? 
 Yeah, we tried to find him when we got out, but nothing. 
 Wait, who did? You-you two went to try and find him? 
 Yeah, something happened to that kid, though. 
 Yeah, seriously. 
 He vanished. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 You weren't around. 
 Okay, this is good, guys. 
 This is exactly what we need. 
 What's the name of that... the nurse who worked at the infirmary? Reese? 
 Amy. Amy. 
 Amy Reese. 
 Ah, it's been a while, but she and I kept in contact. 
 I know where she works if y'all want to go talk to her. 
 Let's go. 
 Shawn : Mm-hmm. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry to hear about Darryl. 
 Yeah, I feel your grief. 
 The man who attacked him was Gary Nolan. 
 No kidding. 
 I took care of that at the jailhouse, and Darryl still somehow ended up dead. 
 Gary Nolan... that doesn't ring a bell? 
 No, Warden. 
 Why should it? 
 At Quitman, they called him "Boots." 
 Oh, that little white kid. 
 Where you think you're going? 
 Yeah, that little white kid. 
 You must have been awful to that boy. 
 I seem to remember you messing with him the night of the riot. 
 That was over 20 years ago. 
 People have long memories, Terry, especially when they're bad. 
 Another piece of information... 
 Mr. Nolan was represented by a lawyer named Jackson Brooks, his friend from Quitman. 
 Jackson. 
 Leave him alone. 
 What you gonna do about it? Hmm? 
 You think he killed Darryl? 
 I don't know, and more importantly, I don't care. 
 You see, this isn't my fight, Terry. 
 I've done what I agreed to do, and that's it, so keep me out of this. 
 I mean it. 
 Do not turn this into a problem for me or my campaign. 
 Do I make myself clear? 
 Oh, crystal. 
 Darryl and I had only been dating, like, four months. 
 When I found him, there was so much blood. 
 Do you know what time that was? 
 I left the bar around 2:30, so maybe it was 3:00? 
 See anything unusual when you got home? 
 Other than my dead boyfriend? 
 He's just trying to do his job, Mariah. 
 Now think back. 
 Does anything come to mind? 
 You know, when I left around 11:00, there was this truck there I hadn't seen before. 
 It was gray, not new, might have even had, like, writing on the side or something. 
 And there were two guys in it. 
 One was white, and one was black. 
 (knocking on door) 
 Just a second. 
 (door opens) 
 Ah, how you doing, little brother? 
 I just heard about Darryl. 
 What happened? 
 Darryl got himself shot. 
 Was he working at the time? 
 You mean for me? Nah. 
 I didn't have anything to do with that. 
 Goes back to Quitman. 
 Quitman? 
 Yeah. Those kids from the riot. 
 This little kid Boots, he sees Darryl in the streets, he hits him, so I hit back. 
 Ain't nothing for you to worry about. 
 Whoa. Whoa. 
 But if he got to Darryl... 
 Like I told you, I'm handling it. 
 And if his friends come looking for us... 
 There is no us, hasn't been for a long time. 
 You're a changed man now. 
 I'm sure God is watching out for you. 
 Amy? 
 Shawn? I haven't seen you in forever. 
 Get over here and give me some. 
 Mmm! 
 You remember Jackson Brooks and Gil Harris? 
 We were all at Quitman together. 
 We just wanted to speak to you about a few things that, uh... that happened at Quitman. 
 Like what? 
 Petey. 
 Peter Curtis was a foster kid. 
 We got to Quitman around the same time. 
 The accident happened about a year later. 
 Listen, you're gonna be okay. 
 (whimpering) 
 We got to get this boy to a hospital! 
 Clearing stumps. 
 (Petey crying) 
 Got a chemical burn. 
 Hurry up! Hurry up! 
 All right, take him to the sally port. 
 I'm gonna have Bobby bring the van around. 
 It'll be faster than the ambulance. 
 Amy : We got to get this boy to a hospital! 
 Hurry up! 
 (crying) 
 Amy : It's okay. 
 You'll be okay. 
 (Petey crying) 
 
 
 
 (engine starting) 
 It's best you stay here. 
 What? 
 Petey. No, Petey. 
 (tires squealing) 
 (engine accelerating, tires squealing) 
 That's the last time I saw him. 
 Where did Red go after the van left? 
 He said he was headed to E block. 
 And Petey never came back to Quitman? 
 The warden said he'd been transferred, didn't say where. 
 I've Googled him over the years, but never found him. 
 So the last person to see Petey alive was Bobby Marks? 
 You got any idea where he is now? 
 Last I heard, he was living in some houseboat over on Chalmers Lake. 
 He's on disability. 
 That flat head must have finally caught up to him. 
 Wha-what about Red? 
 I'm not talking about him. 
 Why not? 
 Because he disappeared in 1998. 
 And I'm not gonna be next. 
 Amy, you'll be okay. 
 Shawn, y'all better leave me alone. 
 Amy? 
 All right, so there's only two marinas out there. 
 I say we start with the one on the Texas side. 
 Yeah, that sounds good. 
 Shawn : You really think Bobby's gonna talk to us on camera? 
 I don't know, but I want to be ready if he will. 
 Man, who cares what that loser has to say. 
 Shawn : G, look, you don't want to do this, me and Jackie can go. 
 No, I'm gonna be there, trust me. 
 Gil, you understand what we're doing here, right? 
 You know, we can't build a case on anything we beat out of him. 
 So at Bobby's place, you got to control yourself. 
 Reporter : And Channel 2 was there last night as Lieutenant Governor Ray Carroll made it official, announcing his run for congress. 
 Carroll says that... 
 Oh, the warden likes you. 
 ...lightly, but he felt the call to serve the people of Texas and the nation. 
 Ray : You know, they say that I'm too tough on crime... 
 Hey! 
 ...tough on immigration. Well, let me tell you something. 
 One thing that Ray Carroll will never do is apologize for keeping Texas safe. 
 TV's busted. 
 Hey, honey, it's me. 
 I'm assuming that you got tied up, but I just wanted to check. 
 Give me a call when you can. Bye. 
 (phone beeps off) 
 Hi, uh, excuse me. Can you do me a favor? 
 (speaking low, indistinctly) 
 ...nice bottle of champagne, do the thing with my parents. 
 Thanks. 
 There she is. 
 I am so sorry. 
 Hi, sweetie. 
 I was just saying Jackson doesn't have the kind of job that has... regular hours. 
 Oh, no. 
 I used to be at the mercy of other people's schedules until, uh, we consolidated those wells in Tyler and then... 
 Well, you know what I love about him? 
 Those teeth. 
 Oh, Posie, please. They are so nice and straight and white. 
 Maybe your children won't need braces like you did. 
 Let's hope not, Mom. 
 Man : Pardon the interruption, but this is from Jackson. 
 Oh! 
 He says he's sorry he couldn't make it and he hopes you enjoy. 
 Bless his heart. 
 Oh, that's classy. 
 (pops) 
 Love that sound. 
 Thank you. 
 Where's Darryl? 
 Dude, you remember me. 
 Darryl's moved on. 
 Well, nobody told me that. 
 That's Eddie. 
 Hey. What's up? 
 So you got the additional 50? 
 The additional 50? 
 Darryl should've told you. 
 Price went up. 
 No. 
 We do not have that. 
 Then get it. 
 You have a few hours. 
 My flight doesn't leave till 7:00. 
 These were the men in jail with your husband. 
 Just look closely at each face. 
 Do any of them look familiar? 
 I don't know any of these men. 
 But I can't imagine my husband did either. 
 He was a good man. 
 I just can't understand why anyone would... 
 ...or why he would attack someone. 
 We're having a baby. 
 None of this is supposed to be happening. 
 I understand how difficult this is. 
 I appreciate you trying. 
 One of these men ended your husband's life. 
 It's just a matter of time till we find out which one. 
 There has to be something I can do. 
 There is. 
 Get that baby here safe. 
 Call me if you remember anything. 
 Thanks for your time. 
 Thanks, Detective. 
 (door closes) 
 This has got to be it. 
 We're just having a conversation, Gil. 
 I'm fine. 
 You sure? 
 (footsteps approaching) 
 That's him. Hey! Gil! 
 That's him. 
 Get off me! 
 You remember me, Bobby?! 
 Huh?! You remember me?! 
 Get off me! 
 Take it easy. 
 You remember me?! 
 Bobby : Y'all got it all wrong. 
 I don't know nothing about that business. 
 You're lying. Straight up. 
 I swear to God. You were there! 
 I swear to God! 
 I remember! I saw you! 
 Shawnie, come on, man. Bobby, we just want to know what happened in the stump field that day, okay? 
 We're gonna ask you a couple of questions, then we'll leave. 
 I can't talk about that. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on. 
 You think we're playing games with you? 
 Hey. 
 Bobby, look at me. You were there in the stump field that day. Red was there, too. 
 We just want to know what happened. 
 (sighs) 
 It was that poison that was the problem. 
 It was illegal. 
 The warden couldn't have no one find out that he was having those kids put it on them stumps, so... 
 On the day that that kid got the stump-killer... 
 Petey. His-his name is Petey. 
 Yeah? 
 I never did bother to learn their names. 
 Unless I had to. 
 Anyway, the warden told me to bring the van around and pick that kid up at the sally port. 
 (tires squealing) 
 It burns so bad! It's burning me up! 
 Drive. 
 Petey : It burns! It burns! 
 (whimpering) 
 All right, stop right here. 
 Now put it in park, get out of the car. 
 Now. 
 Bobby, no! Please, Bobby, don't! 
 Get out of the car. Get out of the car! 
 Bobby. Bobby, no. 
 Bobby, please, no. Please, don't-don't leave me with him! 
 Bobby, don't go! 
 Please, Bobby! 
 Shut up! 
 Don't leave with him! No! 
 Bobby, no! Please come back! 
 No! Please! It hurts! 
 No, please, Bobby, no! 
 Don't leave me with him! No! 
 Then what happened? 
 What do you think happened? 
 The warden told me he took care of it. 
 Told me to stop asking stupid questions. 
 I knew it was wrong, but... 
 I don't know what else I could've done. 
 Jackson : So why don't you do something about it now? 
 Why don't you go on the record? 
 You talk to us. Tell us everything you saw at Quitman that didn't feel right. 
 Oh, hell no. The warden would kill me. 
 Don't worry about the warden, Bobby. 
 I'm an attorney. I can protect you. 
 Okay? We can get you out of here. 
 Get you someplace nice. No, uh... no humidity. 
 Are you in the warden's pocket now, Bobby? 
 Or do you just respect the man that much? 
 Hell no, I hate that man. 
 I haven't talked to that b*st*rd in ten years, at least. 
 Every time his fat face comes on the TV, makes me want to be sick. 
 Right now, Bobby. 
 Now's the chance to do something. 
 We're not after you. 
 We want the warden. 
 Help us take him down. 
 Help us get some justice for everything he did to you. 
 To us. To... to Petey. 
 (camcorder chimes) 
 You can do this, Bobby. 
 Right now, here, you can make it right. 
 (beep) 
 Tell me your name. 
 Robert Allen Marks. 
 Robert, did you ever work as a correctional officer at the Quitman Youth Detention Facility? 
 Yes. 
 Between 1983 and 1990. 
 Before it was privatized. 
 Hey. What's wrong? 
 I was going through his things and I found this, hidden on a shelf in the closet. 
 Why would Boots have a gun? 
 I don't know. 
 It's like I don't even know the man that I was married to. 
 Honey, I'm sure it's nothing. 
 You know guys. They just... 
 You know they like guns. 
 I miss him. 
 (groans) And I'm so angry with him. 
 It just really, really sucks. 
 I know. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (chuckles) 
 And-and you-you know what the worst part is? 
 (chuckles) I don't know what to do. 
 (chuckles, sniffles) 
 I honestly have no idea what to do. 
 That scares me. 
 Come on. 
 (exhales) 
 Let's go. What for? 
 'Cause I have an idea. 
 Okay. 
 This is where I used to come when I was mad at my mom. 
 Which was basically my entire childhood. 
 (chuckles) 
 This is where I first kissed Jackson. 
 Mmm. 
 (chuckles) Mmm. 
 This is where I came when he left. 
 (exhales) 
 (yells) 
 (both chuckle) 
 You try. Come on. 
 What? 
 Yeah, next. 
 Ah. (grunts) 
 Is that enough? (chuckles) 
 All right, give it a go. 
 Okay. 
 (yells) 
 There you go. 
 (both chuckle) 
 You only got a free pass 'cause you're pregnant. 
 All right, all right. 
 (chuckles) 
 You brought the good stuff. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Right there. Thank you. 
 All right. (sighs) 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. (chuckles) 
 (sighs) 
 There's something I just don't get. 
 You said this morning that Jackson is this great guy, and you'd have followed him anywhere. 
 So, if he's so great, how come Boots never even mentioned him? 
 You know they were at Quitman, right? 
 Mm. 
 Everything was just different when they got out. 
 And school was starting up, and Jackson was acting really strange, and then... Mm. 
 ...he just left. 
 Just never even said good-bye. 
 (sighs) 
 Screw it. 
 (groans) 
 Boots was Irish. 
 Think he'd be proud. 
 (laughing) 
 (grunts softly) 
 Hmm. 
 (sighs) 
 To Boots. 
 To Boots. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 (sobbing) 
 I'm-I'm sorry. 
 I wish I could've done something else. 
 Gil : Bravo! 
 Somebody give this guy an Academy Award. 
 You think that was easy? 
 You bet your ass I do! You blamed everybody but yourself. 
 Poor little Bobby, just doing his job. 
 Take it easy, Gil. 
 Oh, come on, don't tell me you believe this B.S.! 
 Let's just get out of here, all right? 
 (door slides open) 
 You're pathetic. 
 You did the right thing, Bobby. 
 Thank you. 
 (sniffles, sighs) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I liked having you hide out with me. 
 Hide out? 
 From Jackson. 
 I've got two eyes in my head. 
 You loved him. 
 Oh, it was a long time ago. 
 Well, I'd give anything to be able to talk to Boots again. 
 And here you've got that chance with Jackson. 
 It's complicated. 
 Why? 
 He's back in your life again. 
 You haven't seen him since he left Brennan, right? 
 (grunts) 
 (thunder rumbling) 
 (grunts, sighs) 
 (thunder crackling) 
 No, I haven't. 
 Well, then take advantage. Talk to him. 
 Gil's a big boy. 
 I'm sure he'll understand. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, would you do me a favor? 
 Yeah. 
 Could you get rid of this gun for me? 
 I just... I don't want it lying around the house. 
 Yeah. 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 All right. 
 You call me if you need anything, okay? 
 Okay. No more wine! 
 Don't want your sister thinking I'm a bad influence. 
 (laughing): Okay. 
 All right. Bye. 
 Thank you. Bye. 
 (loud gasping) 
 Come on. It's all good, guys. 
 We can work this out. 
 (loud gasping) 
 We can work this out! Come on! 
 (groaning and gasping) 
 Unfortunately, this situation's non-negotiable, Mr. Air Marshall. 
 I can't breathe! (high-pitched wheezing) 
 I can't... I... (gasps) 
 Now you can't breathe. 
 (muffled chuckling) 
 That's... that's funny. 
 Yeah. 
 (clears his throat) 
 (metallic clatter) 
 Yeah. 
 Cut him up. 
 Honey, can I ask you to make some of your famous guacamole? 
 Sure. Why not? 
 Jay loves my guacamole. 
 Don't you, little man? 
 Hmm? 
 Oh, look at that! 
 Booty, booty, booty. (laughs) 
 Come on, sweetheart. 
 (laughs) 
 (phone rings) 
 Hello? 
 Hey, it's Oscar. Oh, I'm sorry to bother you. 
 It's all right. What's up? 
 So, I was following up on the girlfriend's statement about the two guys she saw outside Darryl's apartment. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Guess who owns a gray Dodge truck? 
 Gil Harris. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 Jackson : All right. 
 That's a good day. 
 You think so? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 We're doing it the right way, Gil. 
 We got a witness who was there. 
 He went on camera, and he told us everything he saw. 
 Which was nothing. 
 Yeah, that's not true. 
 He said the last person he saw Petey with was the warden. 
 So? 
 So if Petey's dead, that's some damn good evidence right there, and Bobby gave us that. 
 The guy's a liar. 
 How do you know? 
 'Cause he said he wasn't at the warden's parties. 
 Was he? 
 G... was Bobby at those parties? 
 Doesn't matter. Whatever. 
 Gil, man. 
 I know it's hard, but you got to be patient. 
 Brick by brick, we're gonna get it done, I promise you. 
 You got somewhere to keep this camera nice and safe? 
 You're gonna leave it with me? 
 Yeah, I'm gonna leave it with you. I trust you. 
 Good man. 
 All right. Get out. I got to... 
 I got to go. I'm in trouble. 
 See, that's that common folk talk I'm telling you about, bro. 
 I know. 
 (crickets chirring) 
 (water lapping) 
 (sighs) 
 (sniffles) 
 (sighs, sniffles) (phone beeps on) 
 (crowd chatter, phone ringing) 
 Hello? 
 It's Bobby. 
 I had some visitors today. 
 I'm listening. 
 Some of those boys from Quitman. 
 Uh, some guy named Jason, a black guy, and... 
 Gil Harris. 
 They wanted to talk. 
 Just... memories of Quitman. 
 Stupid stuff, you know. 
 I kicked 'em out after, like, five minutes. 
 It was nothing. 
 I just thought you should know. 
 (phone beeps off) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Marina, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. 
 What's... what's my DEFCON level here? 
 Like I said, all you had to do was call. 
 Yeah, I know. I know, baby. We-we... 
 We finished golf after nine holes, and the next thing I know, Joe wants to show me his new boat. 
 We're out in Kema, then I'm bouncing around on the waves, trying not to get seasick, and-and it... there's no... 
 Baby, there's no cell phone reception out there. 
 I can't tell you how much I would've rather been with you today. 
 I got to call your parents, don't I? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 You sent them a bottle of champagne and your sincerest apologies for having to schmooze a client. 
 You covered for me? 
 I did. 
 You did? 
 Oh, baby. Oh, you're amazing. 
 Okay, okay, you smell like fish. 
 You're amazing. 
 (laughs) I know. 
 I'm sorry. I-I wanted to have a shower all day, but first, I got... I got a little peace offering. 
 This is a food bribe. 
 That's semantics. Look. 
 Chinese from Chang's, and I got you your favorite. I got you the... (laughing): the lettuce cups. 
 Huh? 
 How'd it go with Joe? 
 Oh, it's, uh... fine. 
 Business down the line. 
 Just got to be patient. 
 (whispers): I really, really love you. 
 (whispers): But you still smell like carp. 
 Okay.
