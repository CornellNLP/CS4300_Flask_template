 Previously on  Game of Silence... 
 I say we take 'em all down... the warden, Terry, his whole crew, and we got to link him to a crime that doesn't have a clock on it. 
 Like what? 
 Like murder. 
 Shawn :  What about Petey? 
 We got to get his boy to a hospital! 
 Gil :  Something happened to that kid. He vanished. 
 Ray : Sweet Amy Reese. 
 Hey, Uncle D, have you seen my...? 
 Leesha. 
 Is that what I think it is? 
 This wasn't our deal. I can't watch you kill. 
 As long as you want your brother protected in prison, you will do whatever I ask. 
 Ray Carroll's got a safe,  and I think he's got pictures in it. 
 Carroll's blackmail stuff's in there. What are you doing here? I've seen you with Ray Carroll. Jackson, what's gotten into you? This woman is a liar. Marina : Jackson, enough! What's your angle? What'd you do, Gil? Shot Bobby. Jackson :  Are you insane? Cops find out, we all go to prison. Gil :  No one's gonna find out, Jackie! It's unbelievable. Mayors, judges, politicians, CEOs. No wonder Carroll's untouchable. Is this...? This is everything? Yeah, that's it. So what are we supposed to do with all this? Well, for now, we sit on it. What? Yeah. Al this stuff is stolen, Shawn. We can't use it as evidence in court. Screw the courts. Why can't we just leak it to the press or something? Show people what the man's been up to. The warden was smart. He's not in any of these pictures, and we can't even prove that he took 'em. Now, we leak it, it just gives him a chance to cover his tracks. We need to... think about this. We need some time. We ain't got time, Jackie. Nurse Amy said she found something, then, an hour later, she winds up dead. And it wasn't from no damn suicide, and you know it! I know, Shawn. I know. Then do something about it! I don't have the answers, Sean! Look, this is complicated. Between Terry, the warden, what you did to Bobby Marks. What? No, no, no, no. Don't go putting that on us, man. Well, I didn't ask you to go down there and kill him, did I? It wasn't part of the plan, was it? Yeah, no, no, no, no. This ain't about Bobby, all right? You know what? I'm sick of your plan! I'm sick of all of it. (footsteps running) (sighs) (door closes) Oh. He's just upset about Nurse Amy, man. Yeah, of course, he is. Ray :  I don't know  quite what to say, Detective. Bobby Marks was like a son to me. The last phone call he made was to you. What did you two talk about? It was always the same... football, fishing. You have any idea who might be responsible? No, we're still investigating. I was wondering if  you  might have any ideas. I don't know why anyone would want to hurt Bobby. He was about as agreeable as one could be. Mr. Carroll, this is the second time a guard who worked for you at Quitman has turned up either missing or dead. Do you think Red Tyson's disappearance and Bobby's murder could somehow be related? Detective, I'm... truly sad to hear about Bobby, but I resent the implication that my tenure at Quitman could have something to do with this. I might also remind you that I'm running for congress. The last thing I need is to be associated with a murder investigation. So unless you want me to call your superior and ask why I'm being roped in to some kind of reckless fishing expedition, I suggest we wrap this up. Are we done? Yes, sir. (door opens) (door closes) (touch tones sounding) (sighs) Man (shouting) : Go ahead! It's loading now! I think about two. Be careful with the bags. Not a bad way to start the day, huh, T? Not a bad way at all. (sighs) (sighs) (blow landing, Young Gil yells) Red :  Come on, boy. Young Gil :  Let me go! Red :  You better stop fighting me. Ray :  I think he needs to learn how to cooperate! (Young Gil sighs, groans) Darryl :  The warden likes you. Play your cards right, you're gonna get anything you want. (laughter) Ray :  I hope we have an understanding. Yeah, boy. No! Young Gil :  Let me go! (car brakes squeak, engine revs) (dog barking in distance) Gil :  What the hell is this?! You guys got to quit harassing me about Darryl, man. We're not here about him. We'd like to talk to you about Bobby Marks if you've got a minute. Who? Oscar : Bobby Marks. He was a guard at Quitman when you were there. Bobby, yeah, yeah, all right. What about him? He's dead, Mr. Harris. We pulled his body out of the lake yesterday. We think he might have been murdered. (scoffs) Look, Bobby wasn't my favorite person, but... I'm sorry to hear that. Had you and Mr. Marks been in touch recently? Me and Bobby? No. So you didn't drop by to visit him in the last few weeks or anything? No. Why would I? What? I didn't kill the guy, if that's what you're thinking. Okay. Would you like to give us a written statement to that effect down at the station? It's just the fastest way for us to clear you as a lead. Yeah, sure, I can do that. Oscar : Great. Can you turn around? Put your hands behind your back. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is this? What am I, under arrest? Well, it's department policy. We can't transport civilians without restraints. There's a lot of crazy people in this world. But you understand. Here we go. Palms together. There you go. (indistinct chatter, phones ringing) You okay? Yeah. Did you say anything? No. You sure? You need to tell me. Guess I should have expected this. Is he your client, too? Damn right he is. What the hell do you think you're doing, Detective? Investigating a murder. You cuff me, you intimidate him, and you bring him down here to try to coerce a written statement out of him? I'm not coercing anything. Is there a warrant for his arrest? Not yet, but we're dusting Bobby's houseboat for fingerprints, and I can't wait to see what turns up. Let me make this very clear. Next time you take one of my clients into custody without a warrant, I will file with IAD, and I will sue you for civil rights violations so fast, your head is gonna spin. You're upset. Damn right I'm upset. I get this way when the PD breaks the law. You had no right to interrogate him. Let's go. Not true. We have a witness who says she saw your client pay Bobby a visit on the day he disappeared. It means nothing, and you know it. No D.A. would ever file on that. Let's cut the crap, Counselor. You think I don't see the connections here? Bobby Marks, Darryl Williams, you and your friends. It must have been a very eventful nine months at Quitman. Especially when you consider Red Tyson went missing, too. I think this all goes back to E block. I can't prove it right now, but I will. So instead of making threats, I suggest you think about preparing your defense. You thinking about Amy? Thinking about lots of things. You know what always helps me with Boots? Church. Yeah, no, no, it's not really my thing. I know. I don't mean, like, hallelujah, praise the Lord, speaking in tongues. I mean the place. Sometimes I go there, even when no one's there, just... think about him. I know of a good one. Gil :  Jackie, I can't. I can't. I can't handle this! I can't go back to jail! You're not going back to jail, Gil. You heard what she said... they got a witness who saw me get on Bobby's boat. Cops lie. She only said that to scare you. Yeah? Well, it's working. All right, listen to me. I'm gonna ask you a question, but I am treading a very thin ethical line here. How well did you clean that boat? Jackie, I'm telling you, we scrubbed it multiple times. And got rid of all the blood. I think we're okay. All right? Why? Did she say something about that? No, no, it's fine. I'm just... I'm-I'm a little freaked out she knew about Red. Oh, all right, well, she's a cop, so, you know, they read the missing persons reports. How does she know about E block? It's just... it's-it's weird. I don't know how you got these, but thank you. Ray Carroll's been bleeding me dry for 25 years over this stuff. Tell me how this works. He's got stuff like this on a lot of people. What does he expect from you besides money? Jessie, I... I really don't want to discuss it. But like I said, thank you for this. I don't think you understand. These are just copies. I still have the originals. What?! You may not bleed for Ray Carroll anymore, but now you're gonna bleed for me. And you are gonna start by telling me every single thing you know about him and how he operates. And if you leave out even one tiny detail, my first phone call's gonna be to the  Houston Chronicle. Or your wife. I'll let you pick. How are you, honey? After all that terribleness last week? Oh, I'm fine. I'm good. Everything's good. Marina, I like you, and you don't have to pretend with me that everything is rainbows and unicorns. Jackson and I are going through a bit of a rough patch. The kind where you stop wearing your engagement ring? I'm sorry, sweetie. It's just that the timing is really awful. Let me guess. The invitations have already gone out? (chuckles) I wish it was that simple. It seems that on top of everything else, I'm also pregnant. Oh, my... goodness. Wow. Does, uh, Jackson know? I just think I had certain expectations about our relationship that were unrealistically high. Don't you blame yourself for that. If there's one thing that men do really well, it's make big, beautiful promises. (laughter) Hey, be serious for a moment. I have something important to say. (laughs) What? (sniffles) Oh, my God. Marina Nagle, will you give this boy from halfway to nowhere permission to be your slavishly devoted, unwaveringly honest, loyal and loving husband? Till death do us part? Yes. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking about my personal life. Don't be silly. I asked you. Now that you are being so honest, I have to, too. I'm having second thoughts about retaining your firm, and it is... I swear on my grandmother's grave... not because of you. Is it Jackson? Well, yes. When I bring someone into my inner circle, I need to know exactly who they are, and that I can count on them being that person day in and day out with no surprises. Does that make sense? (hinges squeaking) (door closes) ♪ ♪ (pencils clattering on floor) ♪ ♪ (clattering) (knocking) Yeah? Hey. Hey. I have something you need to see. Come on in. Okay. They met 25 years ago,  then out of the blue, Carroll offers him twice the going rate for a piece of land in Louisiana. Next thing you know, he's getting invited to the warden's parties, hunting trips, and on the parole board. So when Hamm decides he doesn't want anything more to do with him, that's when Carroll shows him the pictures of the parties. He's been blackmailing him ever since. Deed records for the land. It's not too far from Quitman and Ray bought it the same year that you guys were there. I mean, you think it could be something? You never know. (sighs) I'm worried about Gil. Don't be. They don't have anything on him they can make stick. How's Marina doing? Well, she gave me the ring back, so... Oh, God, Jackson, I'm sorry. It's really gotten that bad? (door opens) I came by to get some clothes. I thought you'd be at work already. Th-This is nothing, baby. If you think this is something, you're wrong. Please don't insult me. We were working on something. In our own house? Baby, baby, no, baby... Dennis :  We had a deal, Terry! You said set you up with Pablo and this would all be over. Yeah, well, my needs have changed. All right? I got a new supplier, but no stash house yet. It's just one more shipment. It's not your church, Terry. You sure about that? 'Cause I seem to recall paying for everything you do at that church. Or maybe you don't need my money anymore. Leesha knows. What? I was moving the bricks you left in the closet into my office the other day. She walked right in and surprised me. Saw the drugs, everything. And now she thinks  I'm  the one hustling. She... Calm down. Now, what did you say? Well, I had the decency not to tell her it was you. Look, I love and I cherish that girl. And if you think you're gonna ruin my relationship with her over some ridiculous charade that you're the neighborhood flower man, you're wrong. You need to take responsibility for who you are. Lying to your flesh and blood ain't the way, brother. Dennis... No, don't "Dennis" me, man. Now, she about the best thing you have in your life. If you want to hold on to her... you're got to tell her the truth. Before she figures it out for herself, which she will do. Hi. I need to talk to you. Yeah, come on in. I am going to ask you something and please, just tell me the truth. Of course. Did you agree to make Jackson partner because you truly believe in him or because you knew that it would make me happy? Because I believe in him. Why, are you questioning our decision? I'm questioning everything, to be honest. Marina, you know how much I care about you, but whatever problems the two of you are having at home... No, it's... it's not that. Diana Stockman is reconsidering her decision to hire us because of Jackson's erratic behavior. Erratic how? Well, he ducked out of two meetings with her. And when Diana visited me in the hospital, he was... I'm not sure how to describe this... he was extremely argumentative. About what? Her relationship with Ray Carroll, of all things. And why she chose our firm. It was embarrassing, and... I felt obligated, as your partner, to let you know. Okay. I'll, uh... I'll talk to him. Boom. Forensics report on Bobby Marks' houseboat. They find anything? Oh, yeah. And you're not gonna believe it. Let's go. (low, indistinct conversation) Uh, I don't if this is a good idea. A lightning bolt's liable to shoot down and blow up this whole place. Tell you what, we'll light a candle for Amy, one for Boots. If that's all you think you can stand, I promise we can leave. Deal? All right. All right. Come on. Sit for a bit. All right. Annie. Hi. Dennis, this is my friend Shawn. Shawn, this is Dennis. (shouting, laughing) He was the pastor who came to my house when Boots died. Actually, I'm not a pastor. I'm... I'm the director of community outreach here. Oh. But grief counseling is part of the job description, so... Oh, right. Anyway, welcome to the New Hope Assembly. 
 
 Dennis. Yeah. Dennis Lowen? (shouting) That's right. Annie, I need you to step outside. I'm sorry, is there something wrong? Annie, I need you to leave. Shawn, what is going on? Cell block E, Quitman, right? How's your brother Terry? What, you didn't think I would recognize you? That was a long time ago, man. Shawn... People change, now, brother. Don't "brother" me. I want you to stay away from her, understand? Shawn, please. If you come near her again, I swear I will kill you. Why don't we just all calm down. (grunting) Shawn! (grunting) Hold it! Hey, pal! Get off me! Come on. Get off me! Shawn! What, you didn't think this was gonna come back on you?! Huh? You didn't think this was gonna come back?! Huh, Dennis?! Well, I'm back! I'm coming back! Get out of here. Man : Get out of here, man. Get off me! What?! What y'all want? Come... Shawn, come on. You knew him a Quitman? That place was... hell on Earth. And Dennis was one of the reasons. Him, his brother Terry, Darryl, Eddie. They hurt us. All of us. I can't believe he was in my house. Don't think for a second that was by coincidence. What? He was scoping you out, Annie. All right? He was taking a read on the situation. I tell you this... what Boots did to Darryl, I'll do to that b*st*rd ten time over, I swear! No, Shawn. Please, don't. I mean it. This has to stop. I cannot take losing somebody else. You promise me, Shawn. (church bell ringing) Shawn :  The dude is working at a church! You know, I'd like to interrupt a sermon one day and let those people know the real deal about their good brother Dennis. I'd pay to see that. What's that? It's the warden's campaign schedule. I'm going down, Shawnie. Uh, I killed Bobby and the cops know it, but... I cannot live knowing that the warden never paid for what he did. So he's gonna be at Bobby's wake at 4:30, and so will I. And I'm gonna say hello. And I'm gonna shoot him right between the eyes. And then I'm gonna confess to killing Bobby by myself, so they can't touch you or Jackie. Problem solved. Have you lost your damn mind? And what makes you think going over there to kill the warden is gonna all of a sudden fix everything? 'Cause it will. Really? So, when your ass is rotting in prison... you gonna feel good about the fact that Terry is still out there? After everything he did to us? Why don't you, uh, make a list? Yeah, yeah, come on. I'm serious. Write it down for me. List all the people you got to kill to make this thing right. And what about Dennis... why does he skate? What about all those guards who knew exactly what was going on and didn't do a damn thing to help us? What about them?! Hey, I'm just messing with you. Get you riled up. That's it. Seriously, man... where did you get that schedule? I stole it from Jessie. Tell me you ain't gonna do something stupid. Aw, come on. Listen, it's not... You swear to me. I... Listen... Swear it! I was joking, I was joking, I was joking, I'm sorry. I'm fine. I was just blowing off some steam, that's all. All right, man, I'm gonna go pay the subs at the Montrose house. Okay. Hey. I love you, man. I love you, too, bro. Dad? Hey, Leesh. You're out early. I skipped last period. Why is that, young lady? I need to tell you something. I think Uncle Dennis is a dealer. I saw him hiding drugs in the church. I know I probably shouldn't say anything, but I can't believe he'd pretend to be a person everyone thinks he is when he's really just a criminal. Baby, listen, okay? I do know about it. And this is on me. I should've told you the truth a long time ago. Why didn't you? Because I didn't want my little girl to worry about it. I know... that your Uncle Dennis is a very troubled man. But just because he's not everything he says he is doesn't mean he doesn't love you. Just like I do. (Gil babbles playfully) Molto bene. Bonjourno, bonjourno, bonjourno, buonasera. Wow. What's all this? Nothing. Just wanted to, uh, make you some lunch. Good, I'm starving. You didn't make me nothing? Sorry, doll, we're all out of Pop Tarts and beer. Uh-huh. Hey, um, you hear back from the police yet? No. You okay? Yeah. Jackson's on it. Not much I can really do about it anyway, you know? It's okay? Mm-hmm. I love you, Jessie. I love you, too. Hey. You sure you're okay? Yeah. I just... I do want to let you know, though, that... ...you know, no matter what happens, you're the best thing that ever happened to me. Hey. You got something? Yeah. Man, it took a while to unravel. But it looks like a year after he bought this land, Carroll sold it to a company called ROC Holdings. Never heard of 'em. But I do recognize the parent company... Corrections Services of America. We actually represent them. Since when? Since we took on Stockman Ventures as a client. It's one of their subsidiaries. Aaron : Um, Jackson? Can I see you in my office, please? Yeah. Th-thank you. Thank you. Are you aware Diana Stockman controls one of the largest private prison companies in America? I'm aware she has interests in corrections, yes. Aaron, they imprison people for profit. Actually, courts imprison people. Governments contract out to private vendors to enforce those... Oh, so-so that makes it okay. Uh, maybe I should be asking the questions, Jackson. Stockman could be the most important client we've ever had, but because of you, Diana's questioning her decision to hire us. Please tell me there's more to this than some moral objection you have to a perfectly legal business. Yeah, there is. Such as? Such as the fact that she's tight with a sleazeball like Ray Carroll, who was the warden at Quitman when a riot shut it down, after which he very conveniently popped up on the board of the very same company that took it private... Diana's company... the same company now using kids as slave labor in their warehousing building which, by the way, was just raided by the DEA. The DEA? Who'd they bust? (scoffs) Nobody. That's... That's not the point, Aaron. Then what is? Everything else sounds like conjecture and innuendo. The point is these are not good people. We shouldn't be in business with them. (phone rings) I'm sorry, I... (phone beeps) It's... Uh, this is my alarm company. I... I got to go, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jackson. I'm sorry. Jackson! (indistinct chatter) Liz, you better have a warrant for this. Winters : Found a print inside Bobby's houseboat. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be yours. You're searching my house based on a single print? And a motive. What motive? Grudge, prior grievances. None of that justifies a warrant. Take it up with the judge. Don't you have anything better to do, like-like find the person who attacked my fiancée? My fiancée was assaulted. That's for protection. Bag it and send it to Ballistics. This case just gets more interesting every day, doesn't it, Counselor? (knocking) Jackson, what brings you back to the slums of the District Attorney's Office? What can you tell me about Liz Winters? She's one of our best. Why? Well, I'm trying to figure out why a Gangs Squad detective is investigating a murder four counties away. Now, my client's involvement, it's flimsy, at best, and she's on this thing like a pit bull that hasn't eaten in two weeks. What can I say? She is a pit bull. We D.A.s kind of like it that way. Let me ask you this, I have another client. He was killed in jail recently. Now, a lifer confessed, but there was a man in the cell block with him. His name's Dooley. Do you know him? The Viking? Yeah. We had him up on assault. Turned up dead not long ago. Why'd you let him out in the first place? Victoria, please, I'm-I'm asking as a friend. Please. (chuckles) (keys clacking) The detective on the case said the witness refused to testify. And who was the detective? Liz Winters. Jessie : Marina? Can I talk to you for a second? I just want to make sure that you know that there's absolutely nothing going on between me and Jackson. You have been alone with him at my house, at least twice that I know of, but you're not having an affair? I swear to you, anything that's happened between us is in the past. I am with Gil. And I can't bear to think that I had something to do with your breakup. I have already ruined his life once. The only reason he went to juvie was because he was trying to protect me from my own drunk mother. I know. I promise you, my only interest in Jackson now is trying to help him. That's it. You want to help him? Help him do what, Jessie? Get justice. For what happened at Quitman. Okay. How much has he told you about that? That he went with his friends. And I am sure it wasn't pleasant. Marina... (sighs) ...they were beaten, they were abused, and they were raped. All of them. Jackson's been through some really dark things. Gil and Shawn, too. And they were my best friends. And I'm never gonna know what that was truly like for them. So I am sorry, for what it's worth. (door opens) (sniffles) (door closes) (shuddering breaths) (indistinct chatter) Why'd you tell the D.A. the witness in the Klaus Dooley case refused to testify? I spoke to the man. He said he never refused. Which means you lied to the D.A. and you let Dooley walk. Is that what you think happened? I don't think... I know. 'Cause you're bent, Liz. You knew he murdered my client in jail, and you put him on the street anyway. I think you're losing it, Counselor. Actually, I've never felt so clear. It's Terry Bausch, isn't it? That's how you know about E Block, that's how you know about Red Tyson, that's why you're trying to pin the murder of Bobby Marks on me. I didn't do it. But I am this close, this close, to turning you in to the D.A. unless I get some answers right now. What the hell happened to you, Liz? Look, we all make choices that we regret. I know what it's like to lie. I know what it's like to pretend to be someone you're not. But you've got to hate this, because every instinct I have is telling me that this is not who you really are. So talk to me. Talk to me so I don't have to ruin your life. Fine. I'm going to the D.A. Wait. I could take you down or you could take me down, but either way Terry gets off clean. (sighs) My brother's in jail. He's a drug addict, a... fool, and a complete mess, but he's my brother. And I need to keep him alive. I don't want you, Liz. I want Terry. We're not the ones who should be suffering here. It's animals like him. I won't tell anyone about you. All I ask is that you leave me and my friends alone. Do we have a deal? Hey, G. I saw Mario at the job site today, and he wanted to ask about those measurements... (groans, exhales) Gil :  Dear Jessie, By the time you read this, a lot will have changed. I know it's just a matter of time before I won't be able to make my own decisions. I also know I can't let Ray Carroll get away with what he did to me and my friends. Hello. Are you family? No. Let this letter show that I take full responsibility for killing Bobby Marks and Ray Carroll, and I acted alone doing it. (car doors closes) This isn't the ending I would have picked, Jessie, but it's the only one left I can accept. You are the love of my life, and I will miss you most of all. Gil. ♪ ♪ (grunting) What the hell you think you're doin'?! You didn't get enough prison the first time?! Quitman wasn't enough for you?! They can't send you to prison when you're already dead! What, so that's your plan, huh? That's your plan? You're gonna kill the warden, then yourself? What choice do I have, Jackie?! I'm going down for Bobby! You're not going down for killing Bobby. You know I am! No, you're not! I've made a deal with the detective. You're safe. It's over. What? It's done. It's over. You're safe. What? The police are not coming for you. (sobbing) Shh. It's handled. Gil, it's handled. Shh. It's handled. (sniffling) Gil, listen to me. Listen to me, Gil. I know you want the warden. And we got a way to get him. That road he was on with Petey, you travel down that road 15 miles, it takes you to Louisiana. Now, three days after Petey disappeared, Carroll bought land over the border right off that exact same road. I think that's where he took him. If I'm right... Hey, if I'm right, we got him. We got him. Everybody's gonna find out the truth about who Ray Carroll really is. (sobbing) Hi. I know what happened to you at Quitman. Everything. Jessie told me. I wish that you'd told me yourself. If I'd known the truth, I could've at least understood what you were going through. You're right. I... I should have told you. Why didn't you? 'Cause I was ashamed. I thought you'd think less of me. When did all this start? The day Boots attacked Darryl Williams. Was that planned? No. But Ray Carroll and the people he works with, they killed Boots for it. So that's what you've been doing, trying to get back at Ray Carroll? You know what happened the day before Boots attacked Darryl? I asked you to marry me. Do you remember what I said? Every word. All that I'm hoping for is that you somehow find a way t... to give me a second chance. You were leaving. Marina, we're close to something, something that's gonna... put an end to all of this. Well, then you should go. Jackson :  I think the warden was clearing those stumps to make way  for the new warehouses, but he didn't want anyone knowing that he was making kids work with toxic chemicals. So when Petey got hurt, he had to keep it quiet. So he kills him, he buries him in this land, and then buys the land to make sure it stays quiet. Then he sells that land to the same person he's been in bed with from the start. Diana Stockman. That's right. (insects trilling) (engine shuts off) You sure this is the right place? That's what it says on the deed. We should spread out. They could've taken him anywhere. Gil : What-what are we even looking for? Jackson : I don't know. Something. Anything. You... see something unusual, it might be a clue. All right, you guys take that side. Hey! Check this out! Hey, uh, those chemicals that were on Petey, toxic, right? That's right. (grunting) (clang) Wait. Stop. No more shovels. We found him.
