 Don't worry. 
 I won't let anything bad happen to you. 
 You better close the window. 
 Why? Is there, like, an evil army of ogres coming? 
 More like a large cloud of butterflies. 
 Ugh! 
 That was close. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I just can't control the butterflies. 
 When I get nervous and excited, they just... Appear. 
 It's okay. It's kind of cute. 
 Except for the part where you almost killed me. 
 Look, I really want to explain everything from the beginning, but... 
 Don't. Andi already explained everything. 
 She did? 
 Sort of. 
 You know Andi, mixing in half zombies and half star trek mythology in there. 
 So what are you going to do?

 It's useless. 
 Let's try the blow torch again. 
 Done. 
 You set the trap? 
 Just like you told us. 
 It's the principal! Hide! 
 I can't believe I forgot the book. 
 What should we eat for our celebratory dinner? 
 Ooh, I know... those things you like, those tube-like things. 
 Burratos? 
 Okay, guys. 
 This is it. 
 Call Daniel. The shark attack is on. 
 What is it? 
 It's time. 
 We're going after the principal. 
 What? No. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 No, that's what she wants. 
 You're staying here, and don't go anywhere. 
 I got this. 
 We're emosewa. 
 Is everybody ready? 
 Ready. 
 Um, are we sure about attacking her with water? 
 Water and witches are like vampires and garlic, so... 
 Yeah, I'm with Daniel in this far-fetched, crazy idea. 
 We're doomed. 
 Let's go. 
 Okay, sharks. 
 This is it. 
 On three, okay? 
 One. 
 Two. 
 Three! 
 What? 
 Looks like we won't need that ball of scrap... 
 Sharks, what are you doing here? 
 Don't take another step. 
 Isn't this cute? 
 Look, Julio. 
 Your sardines came to destroy me. 
 It's the sharks, not the sardines. 
 No! 
 Tadpole? 
 Oh, no! 
 Oh, I'm melting! 
 Melting... Mel... 
 We did it. 
 Armageddon avoided! 
 Julio? 
 I'm okay. 
 You guys did an amazing job. 
 We know. 
 But we need your help with these guys. 
 Think you can do it? 
 Yes, I think so. 
 I'll use a variation on the monkey spell. 
 The monkey spell? 
 Long story. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, I think this is Lily. 
 She's done so much to teach and protect me, so turn this frog back into Lily. 
 Lily! 
 Good evening! 
 This is Miss Information reporting live from the school gymnasium. 
 The music is thumping, and the costumes are kicking. 
 So if you're not here yet, come on down and get your anime on. 
 Then the principal turned Lily into a frog. 
 Then Emma turned Lily back into, well, Lily. 
 And how do you know all this? 
 I told you and her on our way over here. 
 Oh. 
 Hey, Diego. 
 "Hey, Diego"? 
 We came to the dance together, remember? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Well, um, get me something to drink. 
 What's taking so long? 
 Daniel's still not here? 
 No. 
 Well, did you go over to his house? 
 I called. 
 His parents said he was getting ready for the dance, but he's not there anymore, so they assumed he left. 
 What if he did stand me up? 
 Daniel wouldn't do that, especially since he knows he'd have me to deal with if he did. 
 I'm sure he'll be here any minute. 
 Ring. 
 Ring! 
 Daniel! 
 Not exactly. 
 You? I thought we melted you! 
 Ha! 
 You think you can take me down with your juvenile little water balloons? 
 What do you want? 
 I want you to meet me here at the theater. 
 No way! Why would I do that? 
 Because I have something you want. 
 Wave at Emma, Mr. Miller. 
 I'm fine, em. Don't come. 
 Don't come! 
 See you soon. 
 I know I'm going over the top with the theatrics, but this is my big moment. 
 We'll save some for later. 
 Ooh, and I forgot my camera. 
 You don't mind if I use your phone, do you? 
 You have unlimited data, right? 
 You know you're not going to get away with this. 
 Do you know how many times I've heard that? 
 Don't even try. 
 You'll sink more. 
 A little trick I learned in South America. 
 Bubble gum quicksand. 
 What do we do? 
 I don't know! 
 I thought for sure we destroyed her. 
 Should've known better. 
 I've got to do something! 
 Wait! Where you going? 
 To rescue Daniel! 
 Okay. Great, great.  
 Let's stop by my house. I'll get my guardian's Kit. 
 No! I'm going alone. I can't put anyone else at risk, especially you. 
 Wow. That's really sweet. But now's not the time! 
 It's principal butt-kicking time. 
 Somebody needs to warn Diego and Maddie that the principal's still alive. 
 Yeah, yeah. You're right. You're right. 
 Someone should definitely warn Diego. 
 Okay, and Maddie. 
 Oh, you mean me? 
 Yes! 
 I have to do this one-on-one. 
 Or chosen one on chosen one. 
 
 
 
 Hey, miss pitch. 
 It's good to see you. It's been a while. 
 Hi, Diego. 
 You look different. Did you... 
 Did you do something different with your hair? 
 No, not really. 
 I just, uh... 
 I'm sorry. 
 What was I saying? I... 
 I was just asking you if there was any more soda. 
 There's some in the back room. 
 I'm gonna go see. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Good to see you again. 
 Diego? 
 Diego? 
 Oh! 
 Guys, the principal... Not... she... she took Daniel to the... oh! 
 What? 
 The principal's not dead. 
 She came back to life. 
 And she took Daniel to the theater. 
 I knew it was too easy. 
 But where's Emma? 
 She went to go save him, and I came here to warn Diego. 
 Oh, and you. 
 Diego! 
 He... but then... and then... and... and poof! 
 What? 
 He went to get Maddie a drink but went through a door. 
 There was a flash of light. 
 And he disappeared. 
 The principal must have him! 
 We need to go save them, all of us. 
 Maddie, you need to come with us too. 
 You're the only one who has magic powers. 
 All right, fine. 
 This party's boring me anyway. 
 Let's go. 
 Panthers! 
 Diego. 
 Diego! 
 Diego, don't worry. I'll get us out of this. 
 Yeah, right. You do that. 
 What are we doing here? What do you want? 
 I've already explained all this to you. 
 The eclipse, the chosen one, the stealing of the powers. 
 You can't even see the eclipse in here. 
 Right on cue. 
 The eclipse has started, which means she's running out of time, which means you're running out of time. 
 Let Daniel go now! 
 Emma, no. It's a trap. Get out of here! Go! 
 Nice try. 
 What's going on? I don't feel anything. 
 Diego? 
 From West to East and South to north, I take your powers forever henceforth. 
 No! 
 Aw, look at that. 
 That's so touching. 
 And so foolish. 
 The hex! Quick, grab onto it. 
 What? 
 The flying book. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 How are we gonna break through the force field? 
 Emma. 
 I'm okay. 
 We've got to get out of here. 
 Not so fast. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 Oh, no! 
 My powers are too weak. 
 Get away from them. 
 Ha! 
 Mac! 
 Ha! Guys, I got her! 
 Come on. 
 Where's Mac? 
 In my backpack. 
 What? 
 Mac? 
 Oh. 
 Oh, Maddie darling? 
 Why don't you come out and join me? 
 You can be my first lieutenant. 
 Maddie's about to join with the principal. 
 I have to talk to her. 
 Eat rocks, principal! 
 Ring toss! 
 Here. 
 Throw whatever you can at the principal. 
 You can't join the principal, Maddie. 
 You have to help me destroy her. 
 What makes you think I would help you? 
 I know we haven't been the best of friends... 
 That's the understatement of the year. 
 But the two of us actually have a lot in common. 
 That we're both witches? 
 So what? 
 So that's a huge change we've both had to learn to live with. 
 I guess. 
 And you've grown up missing your dad, and I've grown up missing my mom. 
 I know it's not easy, but we've gotten through it with the help of our friends. 
 Okay, let's do it. 
 But you owe me big-time. 
 Yes! Now, what spell should we cast? 
 She's been around longer than she should. 
 Send the principal away for good! 
 Emma! 
 Emma, you did it! 
 Maddie? 
 Are you okay? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 My hair! Does it look okay? 
 Does it look good?

 No, me. 
 I...Lost my powers. 
 This can't be happening! 
 I can't just be an ordinary girl. 
 You're not ordinary, Maddie. 
 You're a Panther.

 Everyone's already in class. 
 W-wait. Wait. 
 Wait, do you hear that? 
 Hexy, no. 
 Wha... di... did he follow you here? 
 Go home. 
 So the hex is like your pet book now? 
 Guess so. 
 Pretty cool, huh? 
 Sure, I mean, not as cool as having, like, a pet crocodile or a tasmanian devil, but it's okay. 
 Ugh. Not this again. 
 I'm out. Don't be late to practice. 
 Hi. 
 You look the same. 
 'Cause you lost your powers, and I thought that you would look different, not like you would ever look worse than usual. 
 I didn't mean to say that. 
 What I meant to say is... 
 I don't care whether you have your powers or not. 
 I like you just the way you are. 
 Okay, now I'm really out. 
 So did you get your powers back? 
 I don't know. Let's see. 
 Let's test whether I have powers. 
 I want this school covered with flowers. 
 I guess they're gone for good. 
 Well, you're still here. That's all that matters. 
 I got to get going to class, but, um, I'll see you at lunch?
