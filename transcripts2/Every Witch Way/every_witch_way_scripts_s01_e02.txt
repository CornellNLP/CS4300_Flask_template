 This isn't working. 
 We've been at this forever, and it hasn't moved an inch. 
 Come on, don't give up so quickly. 
 45 minutes is hardly quickly. 
 Okay, okay. Just one more time, okay? 
 And, like, concentrate. 
 You mind? 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I'm just a little hungry. 
 I think we hallucinated the brush floating. 
 Yeah? 
 What about all the plastic hearts in your closet? 
 Maybe the moving company put them there. 
 Yup. 
 They snuck in and filled your closet with plastic hearts. 
 Look, I have an idea. 
 I'm not sure I want to hear this. 
 No, look, we're just gonna do a reenactment of the incident, like they do on tv. 
 You mean you're going to let me put makeup on you again? 
 Fat chance. 
 This time, everything's make-believe. 
 Okay, so, uh, I was sitting here, and you were next to me, and you said, "maddie and her mom came over, and blah, blah, blah." 
 I don't sound like that. 
 Yeah, you do. 
 And, uh, what happened next? 
 Then I said, "where'd I put that brush?" 
 Then you said, "ahh." 
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was you. 
 Either way, we just proved I couldn't do it again, so that solves it. 
 I am not a witch. 
 Girls, it's time for school. 
 I can't go. What if I am a witch? 
 Look, being a witch could be, like, the ultimate social power card. 
 With your powers and my wicked brains, we'll rule the school.

 Did I win the race, coach? 
 Oh, yeah, Daniel, you won. 
 You snooze, you lose. 
 Whoa, kids, settle down. 
 It's only 7:15. 
 You have another 12 hours or so to wreak havoc. 
 Pace yourselves. 
 Robbie, Mel, Tommy, in the car. 
 It's time for school. 
 See you. 
 Bye. 
 Maddie winky, you're gonna be late for school. 
 What's taking you so long? 
 Ugh, worst night ever. 
 I had nightmares that Daniel and smoothie girl were together, and they kept dumping smoothies all over my head. 
 Aww. 
 Well, did you talk to Daniel last night? 
 No. 
 He wouldn't respond to any of my e-messages. 
 Did you try sending him one of those e-musical medleys with the romantic songs? 
 No. I should have thought of that. 
 Anyway, I realized that I have the power to get Daniel back and get rid of smoothie girl all at the same time. 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, Maddie, I knew you'd figure it out on your own. 
 Sweetie, you are going to make a fantastic witch. 
 Mom, how could you say that about me? 
 Oh, no. 
 Um, uh, wait. 
 When you say you have the "power" to get Daniel back, what do you mean? 
 That I have the power to ridicule smoothie girl in front of Daniel and the whole school. 
 What did you think I meant? 
 You are 14 years old. 
 It's time you knew the truth about the van pelts. 
 If you're talking about how grandma Lydia likes to keep random things in Mason jars... 
 No, no, no. 
 There's just no other way to say this. 
 Maddie, we are witches, real life witches. 
 Witches? 
 Oh, mother, we are? 
 Yes, Maddie, and you... 
 And I have the craziest mother of all. 
 Witches? Please. 
 Now, how are you at rhyming? 
 Because you know you have to rhyme to spell. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 Maddie, I don't think those shoes fit you right. 
 Let me try them on. 
 I'm so tired. I can't even add. 
 That's always been an issue for you. 
 Remember second grade? 
 What's 2 plus 2? 
 Funny. 
 Sharks, let's not turn on each other, okay? 
 We're all in the same boat. 
 And it's sinking thanks to you. 
 You couldn't have waited till after the test to break up with Maddie? 
 And what if one of us fails? 
 The sharks are donezo. 
 Don't worry. We'll think of something. 
 We just need some extra time to study. 
 Yeah, and how do you propose we get some of that? 
 Wait, I think Daniel's on to something. 
 Daniel's on to what? 
 Uh, Daniel is on to the final selection round of  world's wildest ninja warrior. 
 I know you're always up to something. 
 One more slipup and the sharks are on the extinction list. 
 Maybe you need, like, a wand or something. 
 You're really into this, I mean, for someone who was terrified last night. 
 You have a giant zit on your nose. 
 No, I don't. 
 See you after class. 
 Your mom has always been a little, you know. 
 Hey, I'm the only one who can call my mom... 
 Well, I think she sounds crazy. 
 Didn't I turn Katie's hair blue? 
 So if you were a witch, how would it work? 
 I'm not sure. 
 I wasn't really paying any attention. 
 I think she said that the spells have to rhyme. 
 That'd be really cliche, but let's find out. 
 Turn Sophie into a pair of shoes. 
 I'll start with something a little less drastic, like giving her huge feet. 
 What rhymes with feet? 
 Street. 
 Good one. 
 Hi, guys. 
 It's a brilliant idea. 
 Thank you. 
 You didn't think of it. Tony did. 
 Guys, guys, wait a sec. 
 This is just a hypothetical. 
 Whoa. Watch your mouth. 
 There's girls present. 
 No, I wasn't actually proposing to do it. 
 Yeah, but it's perfect 'cause we have chemistry right before math. 
 Let's do it, guys. 
 Yeah. 
 Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. 
 What? 
 I'm all for helping you guys, but, uh, I have an upcoming magic show at the seven. 
 And... 
 I need some, uh, volunteers. 
 Wait, no. Guys, guys, guys, come on. 
 You again? 
 What did you hear us say? 
 Nothing. 
 It's hard to make out what anybody says in here. 
 There's a really strong echo. 
 Hello, hello, hello, hello... 
 Who said that? 
 You're spying on me, aren't you? 
 Just ignore me. I'm not even here. 
 Uh, carry on. You were trying to rhyme. 
 Let me help. 
 The word on the street is that Katie has gigantic feet. 
 You were spying on me. 
 Uh, Maddie. 
 Not right now, Sophie. 
 I have lives to ruin, one in particular. 
 But look! 
 Okay, let's go through this. 
 Right before the end of class... 
 I make the smoke. 
 Which will... 
 Set off the fire alarm. 
 And then we'll... 
 Miss most of math class. 
 Which means we won't be able to take the test until... 
 No wait, I'll get it. 
 Oh, I gave you the easiest one. 
 Okay, maybe we still have time to study. 
 You can't back out of this. 
 It was your girlfriend that kept us from studying. 
 Ex-girlfriend. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 For good this time. 
 Oh, really? 
 I'll never find shoes this size. 
 Did you do this? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 If anyone's going to cast spells in this school, it's going to be  moi. 
 Cast spells? I don't know what you're... 
 Hey, I'm talking to you. 
 Hey, let go. It's my phone. 
 Ah, that's it. 
 Tony, that is not gonna do. 
 Yeah, I mean, if we want to get out of our math test, we're gonna need something strong. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 Andi, stop, stop. 
 Andi, Andi, what are you doing? 
 What's going on back there? 
 Nothing. 
 What is that? 
 Daniel's my boyfriend. Get it? 
 Got it. 
 Look, Maddie, I'm not trying to steal your boyfriend. 
 Good. You better not be. 
 Otherwise, I'll... 
 What is that? 
 It smells rank. 
 Where is that coming from? 
 Actually, can you finish your thought? 
 I'd like to know in advance what you're thinking of doing to me. 
 Panthers, let's get outside. 
 Now. 
 And when you solve for "x," you get what? 
 Hmm? Anyone? 
 Oh, that's bad. 
 I've had some bad ones in my classroom, but that's, oh. 
 It's not that, Mr. alonzo. 
 It's that. 
 Okay, everyone, everyone calmly, calmly, let's go to the courtyard, okay? 
 Calmly. 
 Oh, no, I've got to get out of here. 
 It's okay, Gigi. 
 That smoke is not coming from a fire. 
 I don't care about that. 
 I've got to get the scoop on the story behind the smoke. 
 Hey, let me out of here. 
 Quick, cast a spell or something. 
 I told you it doesn't work that way. 
 You have to rhyme, and rhyming's really hard. 
 Come on. 
 Uh... 
 Never mind the clock on this door, put a lock. 
 That was amazing. 
 So it's true. You really are a witch. 
 And my first official order of business as a witch is to make Andi pay for that horrible message. 
 Why does she hate me so much? 
 You sent everyone cancellation cards to two of her birthday parties. 
 And she fell asleep in homeroom, and you shaved her eyebrows off. 
 Still, she has no right to lie about Daniel and I. 
 Now I need another evil prank to play on her. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Andi, have you seen Emma? 
 No. 
 She's missing? 
 Why do you care? 
 I mean, oh, no. 
 Maddie, have you seen her? 
 No, Mr. alonzo, I haven't. 
 Is everyone accounted for? 
 My daughter's still missing. 
 What if she's still in there? 
 Help! 
 Emma! 
 Emma! 
 Daniel? 
 Daniel, in here! 
 Emma, where are you? 
 In the bathroom, Daniel. 
 What? 
 Daniel, the door's jammed. 
 I know this sounds bizarre, but it's padlocked. 
 What? How? 
 Stand back. 
 I'm knocking it down. 
 What? Wait! 
 Come on, you see this on tv all the time, and it almost always works. 
 Oh, it's so embarrassing. 
 Of course, I get stuck in here. 
 I wish I could just disappear. 
 Ah! 
 Emma! 
 Guys, there's Daniel. 
 Did you find her? 
 Yes. 
 No, sort of. 
 When I... Poof. 
 Daniel, you're safe. 
 You're... Ew, stinky. 
 All right, let's call it in. 
 There goes my perfect record. 
 I haven't lost a student in weeks. 
 Emma, you're okay... And wet. 
 Emma, what happened? 
 I don't know. 
 First I was in the bathroom and I couldn't get the door open because Maddie... 
 Do we really have to go into details? 
 Anyway, the smoke started filling the room and I was all... 
 Then suddenly I was, poof, in the pool. 
 We were worried sick. 
 I was about to call the police. 
 It's okay, Francisco. 
 She probably got disoriented by the smell and ended up in the pool. 
 The pool is 20 yards away. 
 Fire chief says we're all clear. 
 Shoo, back to class before I start taking names. 
 That was so brave what Daniel did, the way he rushed off to save that girl you locked in the bathroom. 
 Daniel must really like her. 
 Katie, you take back what you said or else I'll turn your hair red. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 I just want to let you know that I totally forgive you for what you said. 
 Me next, me next. 
 But make mine shocking pink with glitter strands. 
 No. 
 No, no. 
 Not again! 
 It frames your face perfectly. 
 Really, you should be thanking me. 
 Chillax, bro. 
 Nobody knows it was us. 
 And if we get caught, the sharks are donezo. 
 We just have to stick together. 
 Nobody blabs. 
 What about Tony? 
 He's a solid guy. 
 I don't think we have to worry. 
 Aah! 
 Tony. 
 Are you okay? 
 Tony? 
 We're in trouble. 
 Shh. Not so loud. 
 What if the principal walks by and suspects we were responsible for the white smoke? 
 I suspect you were responsible for the white smoke. 
 Innocent until proven guilty! 
 I have the right to remain silent. 
 Oh, say, can you see this is America? 
 No, we didn't. 
 But this is my school, and I'm giving whoever made the smoke until tomorrow to confess. 
 Otherwise, I'm flunking the entire class. 
 And sayonara, sharks. 
 Tony, Tony, Tony. 
 We're out of mango, margo, but I got you ras... 
 Are you making a collage? 
 No. 
 No, um, I was, I was just, uh, sitting by your desk and, um, all your glitter got stuck to my hand... uh-huh... 
 Not to change the subject or anything but, uh, what happened with Maddie today? 
 Oh, the usual. 
 "Daniel is mine." 
 "You looked left. You're lying" 
 "I'm a witch." 
 Sounds about right. 
 Wait, wait, Maddie's a what? 
 Well, I overheard her say that her mom told her that she's a witch. 
 Maddie, a witch? 
 That's the most terrifying thing I've heard since... 
 Since, well, ever. 
 If she's a witch, do you think she knows I might be... 
 A witch? No way. 
 If witches are real, and there can only be one at iridium high, it's going to be  moi. 
 That's true. 
 I've heard a lot of people call you that. 
 Hi, girls. 
 Katie? 
 Oh, honey, you have got to stop experimenting with your hair. 
 Not everyone can work a red fro. 
 Tell that to Maddie. 
 She made me this way. 
 Katie! 
 You did this? 
 Okay, girls, time to go home. 
 Bye, girls. Ta-ta. 
 Maddie, I cannot let you toss around spells like that. 
 I am gonna teach you to control your magic and be a proper witch. 
 Quick, for my blog. 
 This is Miss Information reporting live. 
 Tony has just arrived and seems to be headed to the principal's office. 
 Tony is one of the prime suspects in yesterday's smoke-ageddon. 
 He appears to be turning himself in. 
 Mr. Myers, how can I help you? 
 I'm here to confess about... 
 Don't say another word. 
 I've already confessed. 
 Andi? 
 Maybe you couldn't find her because you weren't meant to find her, because she's not your soul mate penguin. 
 I am. 
 My what? 
 I'm your penguin. 
 We'll be together forever like penguins. 
 Maddie, give it up. 
 I have real problems with the sharks. 
 Is that Miss Information's blog alert? 
 Yeah. 
 I got to go. 
 No. 
 Not until you agree that I'm your penguin. 
 Do you really want to be a penguin to someone you have to force to be a penguin? 
 Yeah, duh. 
 That's how it works. 
 You don't even know how to make a smoke bomb, Andi. 
 Yes, I do. 
 So you pour some liquid into the pot, and you mix all the other stuff like on  iron chef. 
 Right now, I'm leaning towards Tony. 
 I did it. 
 I did it. 
 Four confessions. 
 Go ahead, Mr. Davis. 
 Care to make it five? 
 No. I'm good. 
 It was all them. 
 Ow. 
 Okay, fine, I did it, too. 
 Wow, touching. 
 So... 
 You think I'm going to be so moved by this sad, sad show of solidarity that, uh, I won't punish anyone? 
 And this, this is your great aunt magdalene, famous for starting the first witch coven in America. 
 Boring. 
 Maddie, you have to know this. 
 What for? 
 I just want to cast some spells, you know? 
 Get my evil on. 
 You will. 
 But first, there are many things you have to learn. 
 To do, you must first understand. 
 Oh, I've wanted to say that for years. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 There is this book called the hexerin, and if you have it during the eclipse, you can become the chosen one. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Whatevs. 
 How do you know I'm not the chosen one? 
 Well, for one thing, you don't have the telltale star-shaped birthmark. 
 Trust me, I looked. 
 Just be careful, all right? 
 Okay, so, um, no crazy hair, no giant facial feature, and no sequined pants. 
 Okay. 
 Don't move. 
 Okay, wait, wait. 
 Okay, go. 
 Andi, I'll lose my concentration. 
 Stand back. 
 Okay, Maddie, let's recap. 
 In 1600, your great great great great great great great grandmother alita discovered the hexerin, which is... 
 A book? 
 Oh, Maddie winky. 
 You know what, fine. 
 Apparently, you don't want to find the hexerin and steal the chosen one's powers during the upcoming eclipse. 
 Whatever. 
 I'm busy that night. 
 Besides, I already have powers. 
 Changing your friend's hair color? 
 That is nothing compared with what you could do if you stole the chosen one's powers. 
 Fine. 
 What do I have to do? 
 The first thing we have to do is find the hexerin. 
 But we're in luck, because it's rumored to be with another witch right here in Miami. 
 There are other witches in Miami? 
 Shh. 
 Not too many, no. 
 Which is why there's a good chance it's with that new girl, Emma. 
 Andi has red highlights. 
 Andi has purple sneakers. 
 Uh, come on, you just have to really mean it. 
 Andi has sequined pants. 
 Ha-ha. 
 Concentrate. 
 I would like a brand-new phone, a jewel-encrusted golden phone. 
 Okay. 
 Um, using the same word twice isn't rhyming. 
 Try harder. 
 Concentrate. 
 Pink sweater, laptop, jet ski. 
 Oh, I like where this is going. 
 North, South, East, West, iridium Panthers are the best. 
 Girls, dinner's ready. 
 This isn't working. 
 What are we missing? 
 In the bathroom, Maddie said something about spells having a rhyme. 
 Maybe I should try that. 
 Well, as rule, I wouldn't try anything Maddie does, but go for it. 
 Seems a little obvious, but... 
 Cherry sprinkles, ice cream float, turn Andi into a goat. 
 Oh, she was right. It worked. 
 It's a... 
 Oh, she was right. 
 It worked. 
 Emma? 
 Emma, you girls okay? 
 Uh, we're fine.
