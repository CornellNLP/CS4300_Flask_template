 On your marks! 
 I'll make sure I fix this battle. 
 Make him do the doggy paddle. 
 Come on! You got this! 
 Come on! 
 Go! Go! 
 What is he doing? 
 Faster! Come on! Faster! 
 You must've hit Daniel. 
 I... 
 Why would you do that to Daniel? 
 Do you girls hear something, like a whiny, annoying, complain-y sound? 
 Look, this isn't about you and me. 
 It's about Daniel. Undo it. 
 Or do you not know how? 
 Of course I know how. 
 I just don't want to show you how to. 
 Are you really that spiteful? 
 Yes. 
 Go, Daniel! Go! 
 Like that will help. 
 Come on, Daniel! 
 All I wish is that Daniel swims faster than a fish. 
 Go, Daniel! Go! 
 Go, Daniel! Go! 
 Go, Daniel! Go! Go, Daniel! Go! 
 Go, Daniel! Go! 
 Go, Daniel! Go! Go, Daniel! Go! 
 Is he going faster? 
 He's going fast. 
 He's catching up. 
 Go, Daniel! Go! Go, Daniel! Go! 
 Go, Daniel! Go!

 The winner, I think. 
 What was that? 
 I don't know. I felt stuck. 
 Dude, this may be your fastest time ever. 
 Unless you get disqualified for not swimming the proper style. 
 I'd better go see what's going on, guys. 
 That was awesome. 
 Ugly but awesome. Yeah. 
 I just want to win fair and square. 
 Fair and square is so last year. 
 Yeah, dude. 
 Seems like they didn't get the memo. 
 I can't believe that worked. 
 Well, we are the award-winning Panthers, aren't we? 
 That's why my cheering led to Daniel's victory. 
 Your cheering? 
 That was quite an interesting race. 
 I thought you weren't gonna follow me anymore. 
 I am still your guardian, and it's my duty to protect you. 
 And it seemed like there was some serious witch-on-witch fighting going on between you and Maddie. 
 That was just two girls arguing about a boy. 
 It had nothing to do with us being witches. 
 Except for the spells both of you cast on Daniel. 
 That was... 
 Okay, fine. Except for those. 
 You should be very careful on how you use magic. 
 I'm careful. 
 The dolphins coach says you should be disqualified for not swimming the correct stroke. 
 And what did the ref say? 
 He's agreeing with him. 
 So you didn't win? 
 As it stands now, no. 
 Oh. 
 But I still really appreciate you leading the cheer, Maddie. 
 That was amazing. 
 I know. I mean, it was nothing. 
 Hello. 
 There's still people around who are trying to keep their food down. 
 Come on, Panthers. 
 Let's go buy some new outfits to celebrate our incredible cheerleading. 
 I'll get something in yellow, your favorite color. 
 My favorite color's bl... 
 Ta-ta! 
 Here you are. 
 Who's a slow swimmer? Who's a slow swimmer? 
 He swam faster than you. 
 Only because he distracted me and everyone else with his Lassie impression. 
 Doesn't matter anyway, because he got dq'd. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Don't you remember? You lost a bet. 
 Came to collect. 
 So you saw Emma cast a spell to make Daniel swim faster? 
 Yes, which convinces me that she's a witch, which means I need to keep an even closer eye on her. 
 Do you think she put other spells on Daniel? 
 Like what? 
 Like, he always got back together with you after you broke up with him until she showed up. 
 You're right. 
 Or maybe Daniel's just tired of you doing that all the time. 
 If she put other spells on Daniel, I have to figure out how to undo them. 
 Have your mother teach you asap. 
 Or I could just cast a spell on top of Emma's spell, which would be the same thing as undoing hers. 
 You're a genius. 
 You ready, or are you chicken? 
 A bet's a bet. 
 He'll never live this down. 
 Follow my lead. 
 Okay. 
 Oh. 
 Oh! 
 Come on. 
 One for all and all for one. 
 Uh, we're not musketeers. We're sharks. 
 Nope, right now, we're salsa dancers. 
 Daniel better be under a spell. 
 Otherwise, that's just sad. 
 He's actually not that bad. Boy can do a spicy salsa. 
 This is humiliating. 
 It's her, that girl. 
 She's sucking all the coolness out of him. 
 We need to go over there and intervene. 
 Yes, let's go! I love to salsa. 
 ♪  Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis  ♪ 
♪  baila, baila  ♪ 
 baila. Baila. 
 I could use magic and embarrass her in front of Daniel without them knowing it's me. 
 You're a genius. 
 Like I said, I know. 
 So pizza and pineapple juice. 
 Thank you. 
 No, thank you. You saved me today. 
 That would've been so embarrassing. 
 I thought it was fun. 
 As if my day hasn't already been humiliating. 
 The swim meet, it was so strange. 
 As hard as I tried, I couldn't swim, like it was magic or something. 
 Magic? 
 Wouldn't that be silly? Silly and bad. 
 Bad? Really? 
 Wouldn't you want to have magical powers? 
 If they were real, of course, which they aren't. 
 It's cheating. 
 Of course it is. 
 What did your mom say? 
 First she said... 
 "You're interrupting my husband hunt." 
 Then she said I have to specify where I want to go and point the spell at myself. 
 Well, let's see if it works. 
 I'm excited to see if it works. 
 Me too. 
 Okay. 
 A German Shepherd, a cocker spaniel, send me to a spot where I can spy on Daniel. 
 Are you okay? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh! Oh. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 No, no, no, it's okay. 
 I'm gonna go get some napkins. 
 What are you doing here? 
 ♪ Nah, nah-nah, nah, boo, boo ♪ 
♪ nah, nah-nah, boo, boo nah, nah-nah ♪ 
 Go away. 
 ♪ Nah-nah, boo, boo ♪ 
♪ nah, nah-nah, nah, boo, boo ♪ 
 This Maddie chick, I'd like to throttle. 
 For now, put her in the ketchup bottle. 
 Got 'em. Okay. 
 Oh, great. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you putting ketchup on your pizza? 
 Uh, yeah. Yeah! You should try it. 
 Don't you just hate how hard it is to get the ketchup out of the bottle? 
 Ow! 
 Totally. 
 You know, banging it on the side of the table usually works for me. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 What was that? 
 I don't know. 
 Do you think it's... 
 
 
 
 Hello? 
 Maddie? What happened? 
 This witch thing is getting scary. 
 No way. It's awesome. 
 I was just wishing you had some ketchup. 
 That girl is going down! 
 I Hope your disqualification gets overturned, but even if it doesn't, that was pretty amazing. 
 Yeah, you know, all the cheering really inspired me to keep going. 
 I owe Maddie one. 
 That was...Nice of her. 
 Well, we're here. 
 Good night. 
 A rainbow at night? That's crazy. 
 Rainbow? 
 It must be the streetlights with... 
 I got to take a picture of this. 
 It's coach. 
 Got to take this. 
 I mean, of course. 
 Coach, I'm kind of busy right now. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Oh, okay, thanks. That's great. 
 Did you see that? Yeah, crazy. 
 What did coach say? 
 Oh, he said that the referee called, and he overturned the dq, and, well, I won the race. 
 Awesome! Congratulations. 
 Thanks. 
 Um, well, I better go tell Maddie the news, since she helped me win the race. 
 Yeah. You should. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 I say we retaliate. 
 You could turn Maddie into a goat, and you already know how to do that one. 
 No, no, I say we stay away from magic altogether. 
 It's already caused so many problems. 
 Besides, I used it to help Daniel, and Maddie took credit for it. 
 The pen is mightier than the sword. 
 Huh? Sorry, I don't speak nerd. 
 It means magic isn't as powerful as words. 
 I bet it could be if you practiced and turned into an expert. 
 You could become unstoppable. 
 But I don't want to be unstoppable. 
 I just want to be normal, hang out with my friends without turning them into goats, dream about being somewhere else without ending up in a pool. 
 But it's not like you can just get rid of your powers. 
 I could. 
 If I am the chosen one like nurse Lily said, I can just let another witch steal my powers. 
 Then I could be a regular girl. 
 You do know who's gonna try to steal your powers, don't you? 
 Sure, take your time. 
 This one's a thinker. 
 Maddie. 
 Exactly. 
 And you do not want her to get ahold of your powers. 
 Or Daniel. 
 So how do I know if I'm the chosen one? 
 Once you're further along, we can test your powers to see if they're as strong as a chosen one's should be. 
 It's like the president's physical fitness test for witches. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I Hope I'm better at the magic test than fitness one. 
 I can only do five sit-ups. 
 The one spell I've seen you cast was pretty impressive, so I'm optimistic. 
 Now, we also need to find the hexerin. 
 The what? 
 The book of spells belonging to the chosen one. 
 How do we find it? 
 We search for the book that glows. 
 That glows? 
 Okay, so what are we looking for, again? 
 The hexerin, a book that glows. 
 Hmm. No, wait. 
 Remember that book that fell out of the box the first day I met you? 
 Didn't that one kind of glow? 
 Yeah, I think that might be it. 
 I don't really know. 
 Ho, ho, I know that dreamy I-might-have-gas, I-might-be-in-love look. 
 It's Daniel. Yup. 
 His parents need a babysitter, so he invited me to dinner to meet them. 
 Sounds like them. 
 First they butter you up with good food and nice conversation, and then they leave you alone with the terrible three. 
 How did you know it was him? 
 Oh, you're a witch, and I'm a psychic. 
 You really must be hallucinating. 
 You've got letters mixed in with numbers. 
 Those are variables, and you would know that if you studied. 
 What? 
 Wait. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. 
 There are letters in math problems? 
 Hey, hey, hey. Easy on the notebook, okay? 
 Those are all my notes from the semester on it. 
 It's easier than it looks. 
 You just have to memorize a few formulas, and just take your time to study. 
 What was that? 
 Um, what was what? 
 Nothing yet. And you? 
 Me neither. 
 So this dinner with Daniel, is it, like, a date? 
 I don't know. 
 It's with his whole family. 
 Plus, he said Maddie starting the chant at the race made him remember that she has a good side. 
 Yeah, her backside walking away... 
 Far, far away. 
 If he's been dating Maddie for so long, she can't really be that terrible, can she? 
 Let's see. 
 She put glue on the butt of my jeans, dropped a goldfish in my water bottle, and told everyone I sleep with a ladybug night-light. 
 You do sleep with a ladybug night-light. 
 You want to go there? 
 I just Hope nothing magical happens at Daniel's. 
 I just want it to be normal. 
 Oh! What was that? 
 This book just... 
 Quick, turn the lights off! 
 And the other one. It's dark enough. 
 All the nights need to be... 
 Wait. Look. 
 Very, very interesting. 
 I can think of several explanations. 
 Oh, several, really. 
 Yeah, for this. 
 But it appears your notebook fell into a bath of liquid nitrogen. 
 But who around here would have liquid nitrogen? 
 Terrible three, get in here! 
 Your brothers and sister have a tank of liquid nitrogen? 
 Yeah. Unfortunately, yes. 
 Birthday present from my grandma. 
 Well, they must have dipped it into the liquid nitrogen, and then you grabbed it, and it got stuck to your hand. 
 See? Everything has an explanation. 
 Looks like it gives you the first part of the spell. 
 Then you add the second part depending on what you want the spell to do. 
 Yeah, just memorize the spells and get your magic on. 
 Yeah, because that's not risky at all. 
 Look, if anything goes wrong, we'll just blame it on Maddie. 
 That's the two-witch advantage. 
 How about this one? 
 Seems harmless enough. 
 The glamour spell. 
 Okay, I don't like it already. 
 Too bad. I do. 
 Three dancing girls... 
 Whoa, is it gonna do that every time I cast a spell? 
 I Hope so. 
 It really gives my hair that windblown look. 
 Hey, look, your dad told you to clean your room, so it's perfect. 
 Great idea. 
 I don't want to be thoughtless, so make my room spotless. 
 I don't think it worked. 
 Yeah, nothing moved. 
 Yeah, but something feels off. 
 I know. 
 Like something's missing. 
 My sheets! The polka dots are gone. 
 And the polka dots from the boxes. 
 Wait. You said "spotless," right? 
 You must've made all the spots disappear. 
 That's not what I meant. 
 But it worked. 
 You know, you just need some practice and the right wording, and you'll be golden. 
 What's with all the pies? 
 Oh, my mom just bought them so she can have an excuse to barge into people's houses uninvited, and by "people," I mean greasy Emma and her sad dad. 
 No! What? 
 Emma's having dinner at Daniel's house. 
 That's it. No more Mr. nice Maddie. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Bring me the pie. 
 Okay. 
 These are your date outfits? 
 Yeah. 
 So? 
 Nothing. It's just... 
 I mean, this is your first date with Daniel, you know? 
 Wouldn't you want to look... I don't know... 
 Glamorous? 
 How would I do that? 
 I don't know. 
 I mean, I wish there was a spell for that or... 
 There is, the glamour spell. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Wow, you just played me big-time. 
 No, I'm just helping you sort out your options. 
 Now, hop to it. 
 Three dancing girls and a fool. 
 Like Nicki minaj, make me look cool. 
 Emma, someone's here to see you. 
 Whoa! 
 Okay, let's try this one more time. 
 Someone needs help to understand we're meant to be, so when he eats this pie, he will love me. 
 It's ready. What now? 
 Now we go on a pie delivery. 
 Oh, hey, Daniel. 
 Hi... 
 Emma. 
 Yup, it's me. 
 Super excited for dinner. 
 You sure you're ready for dinner at my house with my parents? 
 Yup. 
 Can't wait. 
 Could you pass the potatoes, dad? 
 Okay. Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 I'll get that. 
 Hello, Mr. Miller. So nice to see you. 
 Is Daniel home? 
 Hi, Maddie. 
 It's been a while since I've seen you. 
 We're eating dinner right now, but... 
 Great, I brought dessert. 
 Homemade pecan pie. 
 Oh, no.
