 Uh... 
 What are you doing here? 
 I just came by to come see you, and the door was open, so I just walked in... 
 And I'm just so used to coming in through the back door here without knocking. 
 Okay, I'm good with that, but we're on the second floor. 
 Are you okay with climbing down? 
 Like old times? 
 Yeah, I guess. 
 "Like old times"? 
 Focus, come on! 
 I have to tell you, Daniel, it's creepy, yet incredibly romantic to find you here. 
 Maddie, I... and don't think it's going to be so easy. 
 I mean, you just show up, and boom, I forgive you. 
 No, that's not... 
 (Thud) 
 What was that? 
 It's probably the wind. 
 I mean, it's so strong, it nearly knocked me over. 
 No, wait a minute. 
 (Hums and stutters) 
 You want to dance? 
 Oh, I get it. 
 You're upset because Diego asked me to the get your anime on dance. 
 Are you trying to ask me to go to the dance with you instead of Diego? 
 No! 
 I mean, um... 
 Let me through. 
 Wait... This is for you.

 You wrote me a song? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 This means so much to me. 
 Great, well, I'm gonna go. 
 I'm going to listen to it right now. 
 (Glass cracks) 
 (Dramatic music) 
 ♪ 
 Witches and kanays, they really don't like each other. 
 That's the principal. 
 And who's that? 
 I can't tell. 
 It kind of looks like... 
 Maddie. 
 Wait, here's another one. 
 It's... it's you! 
 Quick, see if there are any more drawings of me. 
 Yeah. 
 The principal thought we shredded all the copies, but I managed to sneak one out. 
 I have to find a good hiding spot for this, just in case. 
 In case what? 
 Someone tries to steal it. 
 Somebody was in my room today. 
 You look just like your father. 
 (Scoffs) That's not the point. 
 This was in my trunk, my locked trunk. 
 It had to be Emma. 
 Meaning she was just in here? 
 Ugh, and ew! 
 And the nerve! 
 Is your mom still convinced Emma's poof? 
 She might be, or she might be using it as an excuse to cry on Mr. Alonzo's shoulder. 
 Anyone could have gotten into this trunk. 
 I mean, who doesn't know how to pick a cheap lock like this one? 
 You do look just like your dad, very distinguished. 
 Do you think Daniel was just here to distract you so Emma could sneak in and out? 
 No! 
 And how dare you say that? 
 (Whimpering) 
 Hi, em, it's dad. 
 Just making sure you're okay. 
 (Crying) She's gone! 
 Gone! 
 (Sobs) 
 I assume you heard that, so call me when you get this, okay? 
 Oh, Emma. 
 (Gasps) Emma! 
 Oh! Oh! Oh! 
 Is she a ghost? 
 Are you... are you a ghost? 
 Oh, she's real! 
 She's real! 
 She's... see, she's fine. 
 Yes! Yes! Yes. 
 It appears that she is just fine, yeah. 
 Ursula? 
 Hmm? 
 Are you okay? 
 I told you, Katie, no way. 
 Daniel would never do that. 
 But he... why was he here then? 
 He came to bring me this. 
 He made me a song. 
 Wow, how very Taylor swift of him. 
 I know! 
 You know, that could go either way, because there's a sweet, "we drink lattes and hold hands together" songs, and then there's an angry, "never ever gonna get back together" songs. 
 Well, this is a lattes and holding hands one. 
 Do you want to hear it? Not really. 
 Yes, we'd love to. 
 ♪ I know it's been a while ♪ 
♪ But I got to let you know oh, the one he performed at the seven. 
 He wrote this for you? 
 He wrote, sang it, and recorded it just for me. 
 Are you sure? 
 It doesn't sound like a breakup song. 
 It's not. 
 Are you not listening closely to the lyrics? 
 ♪ Every Sunday afternoon now listen. 
 ♪ Thinking of me and you ♪ 
 Yeah, yeah ooh, a bonus track. 
 I know we're young, but I need you to know how I feel. 
 What we've got between us, Emma, it's the real deal. 
 Emma? 
 Did he say Emma? 
 Quick, grab the drawings. 
 (Whispers) I got it. 
 (Thud) 
 What was that noise? 
 What noise? 
 I heard something coming from the lair. 
 So, um, the eclipse... 
 Powers, you. 
 Are we still using the kanay as a conduit? 
 That's the plan, which means I'll have to hold the kanay's hand for a moment during the transfer of power. 
 But wouldn't that... (Gags) Diego? 
 You know, poof. 
 I don't know. Who cares? 
 (Whispering) What are they saying? 
 I don't know, but I think I just heard one of them say "Diego." 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 Andi, do you need help carrying that toolbox home? 
 Can we talk? 
 My aquarium's getting awfully crowded. 
 Maybe you should just turn some of them back. 
 I will. 
 But not until I'm the chosen one, and then I'll be able to change them back and make them part of my army. 
 Who's going to be my lieutenant? 
 Which one of you has what it takes? 
 Are you expecting me to be in this army? 
 Of course. 
 What if, um, let's just say... 
 I didn't want to be part of that army. 
 What happens then? 
 You go back to your original form and have this entire aquarium to yourself. 
 Good thing I'll definitely be loyal to you during the eclipse. 
 And celebrate with me when the evil kanay formerly known as Diego disintegrates into a pile of dust? 
 Of course. 
 I'll... 
 Julio? 
 I will celebrate you becoming the strongest witch ever. 
 (Foreboding music) 
 ♪ 
 Is something wrong? 
 What? 
 Uh, no. 
 Um, didn't you want to go check on that... on that new girl? 
 Yes. 
 No time like the present. 
 Let's go. 
 We have no time to waste. 
 You're right. 
 We better go. 
 Coach julio, wow. 
 I know, and all this time, I thought he was trying to help me. 
 Sorry, bro, but let's get out of here before they come back. 
 Thanks for distracting Maddie. 
 Yeah, why were you in there anyway? 
 I had to get something back that she took from me. 
 Could you be more specific? 
 It's... 
 A book. 
 That's... That's... 
 Totally believable? 
 No, totally unbelievable, actually. 
 Sorry, Emma, you're just not making any sense. 
 I know. 
 It's like when you're watching one of those cop shows, and there's a bunch of twist and turns in the case, and you go to the bathroom, and when you come back, you're all lost. 
 Because you missed a key piece of information. 
 Right. 
 So what's the key piece of information you left out? 
 I can't tell you. 
 But you have to trust me that it's for your own good. 
 For my own good? 
 That's like... 
 (doorknob rattles) 
 You have to hide. 
 Hello there, Emma. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Making a house call to the fastest witch in school. 
 You disappeared. 
 Didn't even have to use words. 
 That's some pretty heavy magic for someone so young and inexperienced. 
 Yes, well, I can run very fast. 
 I suppose some might call that magical. 
 Well, then it got me thinking. 
 Perhaps the guardian was lying, you are a witch... 
 And the chosen one... 
 And I will take your powers. 
 (Sneezes) 
 (Splashing) 
 (Grunts) 
 
 
 
 Who was that? 
 Your little friend Andi? 
 No, I told you, no one is here. 
 You're good, and you're fast, but you can't keep all your friends safe from me. 
 You know that, right? 
 You don't scare me. 
 Your friends are toast. 
 Stay away from them. 
 Ooh, chilling. 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 You have a guest. 
 The drama intensifies. 
 Go away! 
 We don't want any. 
 Emma, are you there? It's me. 
 Is that Tony Myers? 
 No. 
 It's me, Tony Myers. 
 Stay away from him. 
 Wow, that wasn't just an act. 
 You are really protective of your friends, and now I know your weak spot, Emma Alonzo. 
 See you at the eclipse. 
 Emma, stand back. 
 I'm knocking the door down. 
 Ooh... 
 (Light thudding) 
 Wow, that's a really sturdy door. 
 (Laughs) 
 Must be made out of oak. 
 Okay, one more time. 
 Here I come! 
 (Sighs) 
 Can we go back to Daniel's song? 
 At least that had a fun ending. 
 No! 
 I've got to find the perfect revenge spell for Daniel. 
 I finished the laundry. 
 Oh, wasn't it a relief that Emma is okay? 
 Oh, I am going to write a stern letter to the school board about vetting principals more thoroughly. 
 Hmm. 
 Madeline, it... is that the hexoren? 
 Oh, that's how you say it! 
 How could you keep this from me? 
 Again? 
 Oh, her neck is turning tomato red. 
 You know what that means. 
 Where did you find that? 
 My guardian gave it to me. 
 Your guardian? I am your... no, my real guardian. 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 Daniel? 
 I... 
 We need to talk. 
 I know. 
 Come in. I'll get you a towel. 
 (Tea kettle whistles) 
 (Gasps) 
 It's just the kettle. I'm making tea. 
 Guess I'm a little freaked out. 
 Here you go. 
 Sorry I got your floors all wet. 
 Daniel, I can explain all this. 
 Can you? 
 Because I was in your house, and then a second later, I was in the pool, and I don't know how... how to finish this sentence. 
 I didn't mean to send you to the pool, but I can't seem to master my transportation spells. 
 Your what? Your spells? 
 Are you trying to explain all this away by telling me you're a witch? 
 Yes. 
 I can't believe this. 
 It's a lot to take in. Trust me, I know. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 I wanted to tell you, but I was worried you'd be all freaked out. 
 You think? 
 Daniel, Daniel! 
 Whoa. 
 Thank goodness we found you. 
 What's going on? 
 I have magic powers. 
 He must be in shock. 
 You too? 
 Wait, so you know about Maddie? 
 Maddie? 
 Nurse lily? 
 Nurse lily? 
 The principal? 
 The principal? 
 Oh, must be Emma. 
 What are the odds we all guessed wrong? 
 (All chuckle) 
 I need to sit down. 
 So you're a witch too? 
 No, not exactly. 
 I know it's a lot to take in, so let me recap. 
 Maddie, the principal, and Emma are witches. 
 Diego's a kanay, and... 
 Nurse lily is the witch police? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Wait, why are you telling me this now? 
 Tomorrow during the eclipse, the principal's going to use me to steal Maddie's powers, or maybe Emma's. 
 We're not exactly sure. 
 And when she does that, Diego's going to turn into a pile of dust. 
 I need some time to sort through all this, so I can come up, you know, with a rational decision. 
 We don't have time for rational decisions! 
 We're on a deadline. 
 Okay, then no questions about it. 
 We help Emma. And Diego. 
 Yeah, of course, and Maddie if she needs it. 
 Yeah. 
 But we don't tell anyone. 
 How can you be painting your toenails in a time like this? 
 It relaxes me. 
 (Breathes deeply) 
 Yeah, those fumes are really relaxing. 
 Don't you have things you like to do to calm down? 
 Yes, but they all involve chainsaws, and you said I couldn't bring mine anymore after I accidentally sawed your chair in half. 
 What's this? 
 Did you get nail Polish on the back of your foot? 
 What? I don't think so. 
 It's... 
 A star-shaped birthmark. 
 You found it! You found it! 
 You're the chosen one! 
 I'm here for my daily chosen one check-in. 
 You are not the chosen one. 
 What? 
 Of course I'm the chosen one. 
 No, you're not. 
 That horrible guardian nurse lily made me think you were. 
 Oh, don't give me that face. 
 It was an easy mistake to make. 
 You did break Emma's spell. That's hard to do. 
 I could use a Minion like you. 
 (Scoffs) I'm not a Minion. 
 I'm Minion master, and the chosen one. 
 You said so yourself. 
 Relax. You should be grateful. 
 Now, you won't have your powers stolen... 
 By me... 
 And possibly disappear into a puddle of goo. 
 Wait, that was your plan all along? 
 You tricked me? 
 I am a witch, aren't I? 
 So is Emma the chosen one? 
 She is, for now. 
 You're just an ordinary witch who has two choices: Join me or become a frog. 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Any sign of the principal back there? 
 Nope. 
 What about Daniel? See him anywhere? 
 Seriously? 
 With everything that's going on, the eclipse being tonight and all, you're asking about Daniel? 
 Well, he's a part of it now that he knows, and if the principal finds out he knows, she might, you know, frogger-ize him. 
 Well, that would make him swim faster. 
 We look ridiculous. 
 Hey. 
 You were supposed to be covering left flank. 
 I was. She came up on the right flank. 
 Oh, this is going to be way too easy. 
 No, it's not, because there's more than just the two of us. 
 We've got a whole posse. 
 Who? Your math geek father? 
 That doggy-paddling, unibrow-ridden Daniel? 
 The mumbling magician Tony? 
 Yeah, and don't even think about turning them into frogs. 
 Oh, I won't. 
 I'll turn them into flies to feed to my frogs, and I think I'll start with you. 
 You'll have to go through me! 
 Oh, don't worry, I will, but not yet. 
 I need to keep the bait fresh. 
 What now? 
 We need help. 
 We have to ask you-know-who for help. 
 (Knock on door) 
 Come in. 
 Maddie. 
 You? Get out! 
 Can I just talk to you for a minute? 
 30 seconds. 
 Look, you're not the chosen one. 
 I am, and you should be thankful, because the principal... 
 I already know that. 
 Did you come in here to rub it in my face? 
 No, of course not! 
 It's just, the principal is planning to steal my powers and hurt Diego in the process, and Daniel thinks that... 
 Daniel? 
 Yeah, Daniel knows everything. 
 Why are you even here again? 
 I have a dance to get ready for. 
 We need your help. 
 Why would I help you? I'm not involved in any of this. 
 It does involve you. It involves everyone. 
 If the principal takes my powers, who knows what she'll do to our friends, our families. 
 What's in it for me? 
 Besides making sure evil doesn't take over the universe? 
 Yeah. 
 What about your shoes? 
 Okay, sure, you can have my shoes. 
 Oh, you mean right now? 
 (Sighs) 
 There, they're all yours. 
 Oh, and one other thing. 
 Daniel. 
 What? No way, forget it. 
 Then forget me helping you. 
 Wait, but come on, Maddie. 
 Um, can I at least have my shoes back so I can walk home? 
 No! 
 (Banging noise) 
 Hex? 
 Is it you, hex? 
 No, it's me. 
 (Screams) 
 Daniel, I...
