 Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! 
 Hmm. 
 Oh, no. 
 I was walking at too quick of pace, so please fix my mistake and repair this vase. 
 I forgot my sheet. 
 How did you do that? 
 I... 
 You. 
 I always thought, but I never knew until now. 
 You're a... 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 I haven't really told anyone. 
 Why would you keep this a secret? 
 This is the coolest thing ever. 
 You think? 
 Absolutely. 
 I mean, you know, you could learn a thing or two from me. 
 Your trick wasn't bad, but it could use some work. 
 My trick? 
 Did you get it off the Internet? 
 Magician's emporium? 
 Rent-a-trick? Tricks r us? 
 Oh! 
 You think I... the vase. 
 Um, yeah. 
 Trick... 
 Mart... 
 Opolis... 
 Palooza. 
 Trickmartopolispalooza. 
 This is so great. 
 We could do, like, a whole show together and everything. 
 I mean, like, once you learn a thing or two from me, you know. 
 Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! 
 Tony! Tony! 
 You better get out there. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Is hou-dumb-ni gone? 
 Yes, and he's not dumb. 
 He's making me wear this in public. 
 I can call him whatever I want. 
 Go on. Let's hear it. 
 What? 
 It's a great look for you. 
 And that bow tie really brings out your eyes, and that... 
 Okay, no. You only get one. 
 Okay, what was going on out here anyways? 
 I broke Tony's vase, and when I used magic to fix it, he saw me. 
 And now he thinks you're a real magician? 
 Oh, this is good! 
 It actually is good. 
 For me. 
 If Tony wasn't so obsessed with magic, he would have been way more suspicious. 
 I can't go out there. 
 I look like Willy wonka. 
 Help me out of this thing. 
 Sure.

 And here's my assistant, the great magini! 
 Now I will perform the incredible magic egg trick. 
 I will place a dozen eggs into this bag. 
 I'm going to make them disappear. 
 Oooh! 
 Knock yourself out. 
 One egg. 
 Two eggs. 
 Time for your next magic lesson. 
 I need to finish this text. 
 You know, when I was your age, we didn't have texting. 
 We had to write letters. 
 Wow. 
 You're a lot older than I thought. 
 How did you do that? 
 If I have to practice magic, I might as well do something fun. 
 Oh, when did you get those shoes? 
 Since I...Them off Carla Sanchez's feet yesterday. 
 Well, at least you're practicing. 
 I am. 
 And I'm getting better, even without that dumb  hexamoron  thing you have us looking for. 
 It's not dumb. 
 It's a great book of spells, and once we find it, we will finally be the most powerful witches in the world! 
 No! 
 Okay, you'll be the most powerful witch in the world. 
 What? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. 
 We have a lesson. Where are you going? 
 To the seven. 
 Oh, the horror. 
 What? 
 Oh. 
 Oh, that is disturbing. 
 Yeah. 
 Do you need a ride? 
 Nope. 
 Uh, wait. 
 Um, closet me before you leave? 
 I want to go over to Francisco's house later. 
 What? 
 Sure. 
 Something flattering that says, "I would be the perfect wife for you." 
 But, you know, tasteful. 
 Sophie! 
 Maddie! 
 You scared me. 
 Didn't see you walk in. 
 That's 'cause I didn't. 
 I couldn't waste any time, knowing what vile and horrible things were happening in here. 
 Why are Mac and Diego staring at Katie like they're in love with her? 
 I can't tell you directly. 
 But I will tell you that it rhymes with "love pie." 
 "Love pie"? 
 Aw, how'd you guess? 
 She took my pie? 
 My love pie? 
 And now I will make these eggs disappear! 
 Crunch! 
 They're... they're gone! 
 They're gone. Yeah. 
 Are you sure? 
 So sure, I can do this. 
 Hey, everybody. 
 Hope I'm not too late. 
 Wow. You came. 
 Of course I did, because I'm such a loyal and supportive friend. 
 Since when have you been friends with Tony? 
 Since forever! 
 Do you even know his last name? 
 It's... 
 What's Tony's last name? 
 The tiger. 
 The... the tiger. 
 So how's the show going? 
 Amazingly well, actually. 
 Wait till you see his ring trick. 
 I mean, you really don't know how he hooks them together. 
 Okay, I'm gonna get something to drink. 
 You want anything? 
 Soda, two squirts of lemon, five packets of fake sugar, bendy straw, little pink umbrella, please. 
 Okay. 
 I'm fine. Thanks. 
 Okay. 
 Maddie winky! 
 Can I come out yet? 
 I'm so excited to see my new outfit. 
 Maddie? 
 And now all the rings are hooked! 
 Okay, it's okay. Just one more. 
 And now the rings are... 
 Hooked! 
 Ta-da! 
 And now I need two volunteers. 
 Ooh, me! 
 And my bff, Emma. 
 Huh? 
 Awesome. 
 My two volunteers! 
 Okay, we're ready, ladies. 
 I am so not getting in there. 
 I am so gonna get in there. 
 And a brave Maddie Van Pelt climbs into the enchanted box. 
 And she will stick her feet out the other end of the box. 
 I can't. 
 I said she will stick her feet out the end of the box. 
 Yes. Okay. 
 And now I will saw Maddie in half. 
 What? 
 Ah. 
 Ta-da! 
 Oh! 
 What? 
 Ah! 
 I think I broke an arm or something. 
 I'm telling you she was faking. 
 I don't know. 
 We were spinning pretty fast. 
 Oh, please. 
 I've seen her do that fake cry hundreds of times. 
 "Oh, my ankle! 
 "Oh, my fingernail! 
 Oh, my eyelashes!" 
 I need to start writing these down. 
 So Tony now thinks you're a magician, like a fake magician? 
 Yup. 
 Well, there goes your popularity, taking a nosedive and landing straight under with the goth kids. 
 What's wrong with the goth kids? 
 Oh, they're so 2005. 
 I wouldn't be caught dead dressing like the undead. 
 Good joke. 
 How long have you been waiting to say that one? 
 Just thought of it. 
 Since 2005. 
 Hey, Emma. 
 The principal wants to see you. 
 And remember, I get the exclusive afterwards. 
 Oh, good, I found you. 
 Good for me, bad for you. 
 You have to stop Mac and Diego. 
 They are driving me crazy. 
 Sophie, Katie and I need to have a private conversation. 
 Sure thing. 
 Maddie, I'm sorry. I just... 
 I know what you wanted. 
 You wanted to be the most popular girl in school and steal Daniel from me. 
 What? No. 
 Daniel? Ew. 
 I mean, yes. I mean, no. 
 I mean, you're so smart, you figured me out, and no one can ever fool you. 
 I should have never tried. 
 Please don't turn me into a caterpillar. 
 Now, why would I do that? 
 Thank you. 
 When I can turn you into one of Mac's socks instead. 
 It's so nice when opportunity knocks. 
 Turn Katie into... No! No! No! 
 Stop! 
 No spells in school. 
 You should know that. 
 How do you know what I was doing? 
 So, Emma, do you like to play games? 
 Like board games? 
 I love playing games with my students, because it gives me a chance to really connect with them. 
 My favorite is rhyme with friends. 
 I'm sure you've heard of it. 
 I don't think so. 
 Well, see, it's really very simple. 
 You see, I say a sentence, and then you say one that rhymes with mine. 
 How does that help you connect with... 
 Let's begin, shall we? 
 Andi, help. 
 
 
 
 ♪ I want to see this book turn green ♪ 
 Let's try this again. 
 And may I remind you that I can make your life very miserable if I want to. 
 Now, then. 
 ♪ I want to see this book turn green ♪ 
 You said no spells in school. 
 Yes, well, "spells" is slang for "fight" where I come from. 
 Is it not here? 
 No. 
 You're the new nurse. 
 I am. 
 And I better get back to nursing, so stop fighting, or as we say, spelling, or I'll have to report you. 
 We were just... 
 Katie, what were we doing that wasn't fighting? 
 Are we still friends, friends that help each other with boy trouble? 
 Yeah. 
 Then, yup. 
 We were just, uh, larping. 
 Yeah, that. 
 Larping. 
 You were live action role playing science fiction fantasy tales. 
 What? 
 Yep. 
 We're rehearsing for the larping world championship in transylvania. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Well, um, good luck with that. 
 Well, that was close. 
 How do you know so much about lurping? 
 It's larping, and I, uh, had to do a social studies report on it. 
 Liar, liar, pants on fire! 
 I must be getting good. 
 I'm gonna give you one more chance. 
 I want to see this book turn green. 
 Because that's... 
 The color... 
 Of a... 
 Lima be... 
 A-andi! 
 How dare you burst in here? 
 And where is my secretary? 
 She wasn't out there. 
 Oh, g... oh, that's right. 
 She questioned some of my, uh, principaling tactics, so I had to let her, um, hop along. 
 This had better be an emergency. 
 It is... 
 A huge, epic emergency involving... 
 Woodchucks. 
 Woodchucks? 
 Yes. 
 They're the swim team from Boca raton. 
 And what about these Boca raton woodchucks? 
 Well, they're... 
 They're playing piano, and they're poking things, and they're chewing with their mouths open. 
 If this is a swim team problem, you need to go talk to coach Julio. 
 But this looks more like a medical problem. 
 Oh, would you look at that? 
 We have chemistry next. 
 Come on, Emma. 
 Let's... let's go. 
 Katie! 
 Katie, I got a surprise for you! 
 I got two surprises for you! 
 Oh, look, it's your boyfriends. 
 Maddie, please. 
 You have to help me. Stop the spell. 
 I'll do anything you want. 
 You already do, but I'll think about it. 
 Now, I would run if I were you. 
 Okay. 
 I love you, Katie! 
 I love you! 
 I love you, oh, Katie! 
 Love the sweater. 
 You're going to help Katie, right? 
 Not yet. 
 I worked all night on this paper. 
 This is a-plus work. 
 I worked for weeks on mine. 
 It's almost an entire page. 
 Katie, here's your paper. 
 Worked on it all through lunch. 
 You're my girl. 
 What? 
 Now? 
 Not yet. 
 Now? 
 Okay, now. 
 She's learned her lesson. 
 This I can tell. 
 It's time to end Katie's love spell. 
 Leave me alone! 
 You stink, and you're boring. 
 Whoa. What's with the hostility? 
 Mac's hygiene challenged. 
 And Diego isn't boring. 
 Obviously you haven't seen his fire breathing act. 
 You're welcome. 
 I'm telling you, Andi. 
 She was on to me. 
 She was trying to make me rhyme. 
 Oh, I'll get it. 
 Did you order pizza with sausage, mushrooms, marshmallows, and Cranberries? 
 No, and ew. 
 Why would I order that? 
 Eh, just wishful thinkin'. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Hi, Daniel. 
 Hey, what are you doing here? 
 Okay, well, um, I was wondering if you had the English assignment. 
 Sure. 
 Hey, yeah, come on. 
 Look, it's in my book bag. 
 Yeah, look, here. 
 It's... it's right in here. 
 I had it in here. 
 Look... help me look. Uh... 
 Just keep looking. 
 Just keep... here it is. 
 It was right there. 
 Thanks. 
 Well, I was wondering if... 
 Oh, look! Look, a butterfly! 
 Where? 
 Never mind. 
 Um, it's just a moth. 
 You know, no need to thank me. 
 I know how scared you are of butterflies. 
 Allergic. 
 For the last time, I'm not afraid of butterflies. 
 I'm allergic to them. Oh, no. 
 Look at the time. 
 We've got to get our homework done. 
 Nice of you to come by. 
 See you in school. Drive safe. 
 Drive? 
 I live across the street. 
 Right. 
 I meant drive like navigate. 
 From here to the other side of the street? 
 Yup. Bye. 
 Ahh! 
 Andi? 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. 
 But that is one clever and mischievous book. 
 Okay, principal. 
 What secrets are you hiding in here? 
 Let's take a look, shall we? 
 Miss pitch? 
 Oh, no. 
 Are all those frogs in there... 
 People? 
 I have to warn Emma. 
 Mom, we have... 
 Miss pitch? 
 How'd you get out? 
 Hello there. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I was looking for the principal to give her the weekly lice and chicken pox report. 
 But I'll come back later. 
 No, no. Wait. Wait! 
 I've got to bring the book to Lily. 
 So far, she's the only one I can trust. 
 The only witch I can trust. 
 Okay, where'd you leave the hex? 
 Home in a safe place. 
 So then she said lady with stethoscope, she bring the thing with words, give her the knowledge of how it'll work. 
 Giraffes hate horseshoes. 
 Translate, please. 
 The nurse is helping Emma figure out how to use the spell book? 
 You make birthday cakes out of pickles and toenails. 
 I knew it. 
 I knew she was trouble. 
 I eat bark off the fishes. 
 What's wrong with her? 
 I think she was in the locker too long. 
 Not enough oxygen. 
 Deep breaths. 
 Look, there's the nurse. 
 We have to neutralize her. 
 Ooh! Make it a good one. 
 Sure to get messing with someone so spunky when I turn nurse Lily into a monkey. 
 What? 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! 
 What happened? 
 You said you want to... See me? 
 I have, um, a pro... ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! 
 Problem... a big one. 
 Nah, nah, just... 
 Just a quick trip to the salon, and they'll wax that off in a jiffy. 
 And as for your nose and ears, you're in luck. 
 Miami has the top-notch plastic surgeons. 
 I am no mood for your... 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! 
 Attitude. 
 We need the hexerin. 
 Reversing another witch's spell is very di... ee, ah, ah, ah! 
 Difficult. 
 I have it at home. I can go get it. 
 But first I have to tell you something really, really important. 
 What? 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! 
 Andi, help! What is she trying to say? 
 How would I know? I don't speak monkey! 
 I only speak chihuahua and a little bulldog. 
 Lily, who did this? 
 Was it Maddie? 
 Lily?
