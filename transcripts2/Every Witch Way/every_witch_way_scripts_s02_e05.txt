 No way. He's a witch? 
 ♪ 
 That was like a record breaker. 
 Which record... school or national? 
 World. I think you just broke the world record. 
 Really? [Laughs] No way. 
 Training must have paid off this summer. 
 What kind of training? 
 Oh, you know, the usual. 
 Swimming with 20-pound weights strapped to my legs, with a backpack full of rocks, in a yeti costume. 
 I've got to get myself a yeti costume. 
 It's amazing, really, Jax. Congrats. 
 Welcome to the team. 
 We're so killing it at nationals this year. 
 See ya. 
 I saw you. 
 Yeah, I killed it today. 
 Don't you mean "spelled" it? 
 What do you mean... spelled it? 
 W-I-n. Win. 
 You cheated. 
 I mean, first, you... and then you... 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 I think you do. You're a witch. 
 Wizard! 
 I knew it! 
 You're a wizard and a cheat. 
 And you're not joining the sharks. 
 Wanna bet?

 [gasps] Desdemona? 
 Yes, yes, it's just me. 
 What are you doing here? 
 You don't have a guardian while Lily trains for her new role in the council. 
 I'm here to advise you. Let me guess. 
 Your advice is to drop Daniel and be a good little "chosen one." 
 Oh, that would be optimum, but no. 
 I am here to warn you about the full moon. 
 It's rising tomorrow. 
 Lily went over this with me already. 
 It happens every 20 years and lasts 28 days. 
 Got it. 
 Yes, but that's not just it. 
 The full moon... 
 Can have a strange effect on witches and wizards. 
 Are you worried I'm gonna turn into a penguin or something? 
 [Laughs] That's a possibility, but unlikely. 
 However, some witches experience... 
 Extreme personality changes. 
 Some even have... [knock at door] 
 Buongiorno, pizza delivery! 
 Oh, no, Daniel's here! 
 Daniel's a pizza delivery boy? 
 No, it's our secret code in case my dad's here. 
 He can't see you. But I'm not done yet. 
 It's important that you know the risks. 
 Yes, I got it. The full moon is bad. 
 I'll be careful. I promise. 
 Now, please, go! 
 Hey, Emma. 
 My Italian accent's getting pretty good, right? 
 [Chair clatters] 
 Whoa. That was weird. 
 Yep. Um, I think... it was from the wind when... 
 You opened the door. 
 You're not a witch. 
 So how did you know I cast a sp... 
 Whoa, are those spell-o-visions? 
 How did you get those? 
 Like I'd tell you, cheater! 
 Oh, man, iridium high has another wiz... ard. 
 Another wizard. 
 I can't wait to tell em... Emma? 
 Go ahead. She already knows. 
 What, she... she knows and didn't tell me? 
 [Laughs] It looks like it. 
 So tattle all you want. I will. 
 To the witches' council. Wait. 
 You know the council? 
 Know them? I've been there. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Okay, well, I've almost been there. 
 Yeah. 
 At the entrance. 
 For about five seconds. Twice. 
 And I'm gonna tell them all about how you're a cheat. 
 Sorry, Andi, you're out of luck. 
 To the ground, you'll be stuck. 
 [Powers zapping] [Laughing] 
 What? Hey! 
 Thank you. See you tomorrow. 
 Maybe. 
 Hm... 
 Hm... 
 What, exactly, are you looking for? 
 I don't know. 
 I just have this funny feeling... 
 The same funny feeling I had in detention today. 
 It was like my hand was... possessed. 
 Possessed? By what? 
 It seems like... 
 Magic. 
 That's... [laughs] 
 That's... ridiculous. 
 Maddie and I both lost our powers. 
 So, it couldn't have been magic. 
 You're right. [Laughs] 
 Unless... 
 There's another witch at school. 
 Another witch? 
 Yes, that's the only explanation. 
 And if there is another witch at school, then we're in trouble. 
 We need to go... leave town. My Nana can take us in. 
 We've gotta get away from these witches. 
 Daniel! You mean me? Get away from me? 
 Oh, I didn't mean like that. 
 Well, there is something I wanna get away from. 
 You! Fine! 
 When I... get my hands on that Jax kid. 
 Hey, Andi, we brought you some flowers. 
 How did you know I was here? 
 Daniel told us. 
 Oh. 
 I thought maybe you had like a tracking device planted on me. 
 [Laughs] No, we don't. 
 [Device zaps] 
 Ow! 
 But now we do. 
 I can't believe you... 
 [Sighs] Forget it! I'll deal with that later. 
 Right now, I need help. 
 My feet are stuck to the ground. 
 Can you do something? 
 We've pulled that prank a million times. 
 Oh, great! 
 We know how to get you out. 
 What? 
 First, Tommy wrote you a poem. 
 [Clears throat] 
 "A" is for "Andi" who likes to eat candy. 
 "B" is for "beauty" for it is our duty. 
 "I" is for "imagine." We don't like... 
 ♪ 
 Please, desdemona, you do not have to do this. 
 Yes, I do. I have an... 
 Obligation to fulfill. 
 A more important obligation than being on the council? 
 Yes. 
 But the full moon is rising tomorrow. 
 You know how everyone gets. 
 The council's going to be very busy trying to keep everyone in line. 
 The full moon is only up for... 
 672 hours. 
 You and Lily will be fine. 
 Now, which way to the principal's office? 
 The t3 got you out? 
 Well, just Tommy and rob. 
 After they planted a homing device on me, Tommy read me a poem and rob performed a song he wrote. 
 That's sweet. Does he sound like Daniel? 
 Yes, if Daniel was a tone-deaf chipmunk. 
 And don't change the subject. 
 We're talking about you not telling me about Jax. 
 I was going to. 
 With this whole Mrs. van pelt marrying my dad thing, I got distracted. Well, Jax is bad news. 
 The race cheating, shoe gluing, goggle stealing. 
 He stole your swim goggles? 
 No, the spell-o-vision goggles. 
 He did? Andi, we have to get those back. 
 Oh, relax. I sent Tommy and rob to get them back for me. 
 And maybe dump a barrel of dead fish on Jax's head while they're at it. 
 I would say I can't believe Jax did that, but... 
 I can't say I'm surprised. 
 [Cell phone beeps] 
 Maddie just sent me a photo of the bridesmaid dress her mom picked out for us. 
 It's so weird watching you two work together. 
 And after everything she pulled last year. 
 You know, flipping that classroom upside down. 
 Turning me into a panther. That rain storm in school. 
 I'm only working with her, so we don't end up becoming... sisters. 
 Oh, a good thing I brought my chainsaw. 
 My locker's stuck. 
 No! What if you saw through all my books... again. 
 Let me. Emma, wait. Let me. 
 [Powers zapping] 
 Who said you could open my locker? 
 It's not yours. It's mine. 
 Hey, these aren't my books! 
 Because your locker's way on the other side of the school now. 
 Jax, that's not cool. Change it back. 
 And give us back the goggles. 
 What goggles? 
 The spell-o-vision ones you stole from Andi. 
 Spell-o-vision? What's that? 
 I'm not talking to you again until you give them back. 
 Oh, ho, ho, big whoop. 
 You're not the only witch I can talk to at iridium high. 
 You wanna be friends with Maddie, be my guest. 
 But you still have to give us the goggles back. 
 Are you sure you didn't just pick up the wrong ones at swimming practice? 
 Are you sure you can run fast enough to escape my chainsaw! Oh! 
 ♪ 
 Oh, and look who's making a surprise appearance! 
 The co-maid-of-honor herself, Maddie van pelt. 
 Tell me... who are you inviting to the wedding? 
 I'm only inviting my closest friends...[Laughs] 
 ...the ones who know that, even if you might argue, you'll always be there for each other. 
 Wow, that's the sweetest thing I think you've ever said. 
 Next question! We're done here. 
 And there you have it! 
 An exclusive interview brought to you by "miss information." 
 That was... 
 Really nice what you said, Maddie. 
 And I wanted to tell you that... 
 I forgive you for forcing me to be your proxy. 
 You forgive me? [Laughing] 
 Diego : [Laughs] 
 It's me who needs to forgive you. Irritating. 
 And I don't! 
 Oh! 
 Oh, um... hey. What are you doing here? 
 I was eating lunch. Same as you. 
 Right. Listen, Emma... 
 Yes? 
 Jax : [Powers zapping] 
 [Cup drops to floor] 
 Jax : [Powers zapping] 
 Daniel : Whoa. 
 Both : I'm sorry about last night! 
 No, you don't have to apologize! 
 I was wrong! 
 Emma : [Laughs] 
 
 
 
 ♪ 
 Excuse me, sir? 
 I'm lost and don't know how to get home. 
 Can you help me? 
 You're... Daniel's little brother, yeah? 
 Yes. 
 Well, you're in luck. 
 He's coming right this way. 
 Oh! Uh, I just remembered how to get home. 
 It's that-a-way! 
 Hey, Jax. Isn't that Andi's locker? 
 Oh, yeah, it was. 
 But principal Alonso reassigned it to me. 
 It's right next to Emma's, I think. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 Everything all right between you two? 
 Yeah, it's great... uh, most of the time. 
 Most of the time? 
 Well, we got in an argument yesterday about how we're so... different. 
 It's tough, man. 
 Opposites do attract, but sometimes your differences could end up ruining everything. 
 You think? 
 I'm no shrink. Ha. 
 I'm not saying break up with her or anything. 
 But, if you do, there are lots of other fish in the sea... 
 More, more like you fish. 
 Somebody say "fish"? 
 Hey! Oh, you'd better run! I'm gonna get you! 
 Wow, thanks, guys. 
 Um... 
 You're excused. Andi! 
 They did you a huge favor. 
 Take a seat. I'll get you something to eat. 
 Hey, did you guys like that pie you had last time? 
 Both : Oooh, yes. 
 Wait! 
 Stay! 
 The pie! 
 There's residual spell matter on that pie. 
 Residual what? 
 See for yourself. 
 It's the same stuff I saw trailing off Jax when he cheated at the tryouts. 
 Oh, no. 
 My dad must have looked at Ursula right after eating the pie. 
 And they must have looked at you right after they ate the pie. 
 That's why... no! 
 That's just 'cause I'm super cool and awesome. 
 I've gotta find my dad and reverse the spell. 
 Great, let's go. 
 But, first... 
 Oh, do we have to? 
 I mean, they're so... helpful. 
 Come on, just look at them. 
 Okay. 
 Who did this to you, I still can't tell. 
 But now that we know, let's break this love spell. 
 [Powers zapping] 
 What are we doing here? 
 Did we walk home to the wrong house? 
 Afraid so. 
 But don't worry, your house is right across the street. 
 I'll walk you there. 
 Mystery solved. 
 "Love pie." 
 "Love pie"? Hey, that's my thing! 
 Your strawberry-banana-coconut smoothie with a dollop of yogurt and a spritz of lime. 
 Mmm! This is delicious! 
 It is? 
 Yes. 
 It's the exact right amount of frozen. 
 I froze it using my... [blowing air] 
 ...up to the point of frozen-ness I know you like. 
 Katie and Sophie have been trying for years and still can't get it right. 
 Thanks. 
 So, does this mean... you forgive me? 
 I... [laughs] 
 20 percent forgive you. 
 Oh! Only 80 percent to go! 
 I'm gonna get there, Maddie! You just wait! 
 [Clears throat] 
 Did I invite you to sit down? 
 No, but you'll be glad I did. 
 I'm Jax. Jax novoa. So? 
 So, I'm a wizard. 
 [Laughs] 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Jax : [Powers zapping] 
 Hey! How'd you do that? 
 You didn't even cast a spell. 
 Yes, I did. In my head. 
 You can do that? 
 Yeah. 
 I can teach you. Oooh, yes. 
 Okay, first, cast a spell out loud. 
 Actually, I... 
 I can't right now. 
 Who cares if people are around. 
 No, it's not that. It's just... 
 My powers disappeared. Oh. 
 But I'll get them back any day now. 
 If you don't know where your powers went, it probably means the council took them without telling you. 
 Then I'm gonna go there and demand they give them back. 
 [Laughs] You obviously know nothing about the council. 
 Maybe not, but I know Maddie van pelt. 
 And Maddie van pelt always gets what she wants. 
 Do you see them? 
 Yeah, they're right there. 
 That's the scariest thing I've ever seen. 
 I... I... 
 No, no, no, no. Get it together. 
 You have a spell to cast. [Deep sigh] 
 Who did this to you, I still can't tell. 
 But now that we know, let's break this spell. 
 Stop. [Powers zapping] 
 Now, darling... 
 I know that you thought the 50-piece orchestra for the wedding might be a little much. 
 But I thought... Ww-w-what wedding? 
 My... wedding. 
 You're getting married? [Laughs] 
 Thank goodness. I-I-I mean... congratulations. 
 [Laughs] Um... 
 What am I doing here, again? Having pizza... 
 With your ursy wursy. What's an ursy wursy? 
 Whoa! I gotta get home. 
 Congratulations again on the wedding. 
 I'd love to meet the victim... I mean, the groom. Bye. 
 A home remedy? 
 You broke the "love spell" on your dad with a home remedy? 
 Yep. Lily taught me some for cases, um, just like this. 
 You see? It all worked out. 
 So, what did you do? 
 I... I... 
 She made Mr. Alonso drink a gallon of arugula tea. 
 Disgusting! 
 And then she steamed it and made him eat arugula while chanting "Ursula equals arugula." 
 And that worked because everyone hates arugula. 
 It's true. Everyone hates arugula. 
 Okay, I believe you. 
 Thank you for not being my sister. 
 You're welcome. 
 We're done here! 
 That was a close call. 
 When in trouble... arugula. 
 Hey, by the way, have you heard of the new gym teacher? 
 No, I wonder who it is? 
 [Whistle shrilling] 
 Me! [Laughs] Isn't this great? 
 Now, go change and let's play some basket-foot-badminton ball! 
 ♪ 
 [Laughing] 
 Ooh, I have read a lot of books in my lifetime, but you are definitely the most interesting. 
 Oooh, and the most fun. Yes, you are. 
 Oooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. 
 [Scoffs] Look at her. Buttering hex up. 
 [Mimicking] And you are definitely the most interesting. 
 Aw, are you jealous? 
 No. I'm just sayin'. 
 You take care of something. 
 Make sure its pages aren't creased. 
 You expect a little loyalty, you know? 
 My turn! 
 I didn't finish telling you about the full moon. 
 Oh, yeah, we were interrupted by da... 
 A-a-a-aniel, who you obviously haven't broken up with yet. 
 And I'm not going to. 
 Stubborn. 
 Just like your mother. Right, you knew my mother. 
 Did you know her well? Were you friends? 
 We were. Good friends. 
 She helped me through a tough full moon 20 years ago. 
 What do you mean "a tough full moon"? 
 The full moons affect all witches and wizards differently. 
 It can make our powers grow even stronger or... 
 [Blows air] Disappear completely. 
 Its effect on me was particularly strong. 
 What happened to you? 
 I don't remember... 
 Much, but... the full moon can make your personality change. 
 And it changed mine so much that I barely knew who I was. 
 Wow. 
 But Maria helped me get through it. 
 What if the full moon has a strong effect on me? 
 Well, that's why I'm here. 
 And I will stay with you until it's over. 
 I hope I can help you the same way that your mother did for me. 
 Thanks. 
 ♪ 
 Hey, Emma. 
 Danny. Come in. 
 My dad's out returning boxes of feather fans. 
 Can you come outside for a second? 
 I wanna show you something. 
 Wow. I've never been here. 
 Did you do this? 
 Yeah. It's a little dorky, but I thought you... 
 I love it! And it's not dorky. 
 It's beautiful. 
 I've never even been here. 
 Yeah. Not a lot of people know about this place. 
 Most of the dock got torn down a few years back. 
 It's so peaceful. 
 Look up. 
 Emma : A full moon. 
 Daniel : Yeah, a full moon. It's beautiful, right? 
 Emma : Yeah. 
 We're closing. 
 It says on the sign you don't close for another... 
 [Inhales] Two minutes and fifty-five seconds. 
 Okay, fine. 
 But you're gonna have to exit through the back. 
 Does something smell... 
 Rotten to you? No. [Sniffs] 
 Ewwww. 
 I could swear it stinks of kanay. 
 [Sniffing] 
 Exit through the back! 
 That human has no idea who I am. 
 [Gasping] What's going on? 
 No! No! No, not again! No! No! 
 Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! I'm back! 
 Maria castillo might be gone, but revenge is a dish better served... 
 To her daughter! [Nasty laughter]
