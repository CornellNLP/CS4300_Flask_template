 What happened? You said you wanted to see me. 
 I have, um... A pro... 
 Problem... a big one. 
 No, no, just a quick trip to the salon, and they'll wax that off in a jiffy. 
 I am in no mood for your... 
 Attitude. 
 We need the hexerin. 
 Reversing another witch's spell is very... 
 Difficult. 
 I have it at home. I can go get it. 
 But wait, first I have to tell you something really, really important. 
 What? 
 Andi, help. What is she trying to say? 
 How would I know? I don't speak monkey. 
 I only speak chihuahua... 
 And a little bulldog. 
 Lily, who did this? 
 Was it Maddie? 
 Lily? 
 Oh, wow! What an awesome spell! 
 I mean... Terrible, terrible spell. 
 Hey. 
 Lily? 
 Lily, what were you trying to tell me? 
 Maybe you can act it out for me? 
 You wanted to say that we need to run around, hop up and down, hide under the desk... 
 Hey, Sherlock, she's just being a monkey. 
 But whatever she wanted to say sounded very important. 
 Ah, how do you know? 
 Because she said, "I need to tell you something very important." 
 We can fix this. 
 I just need a minute to think and... 
 Miss Lily, are you in there? 
 Oh, come on! 
 It's Daniel. 
 I just wanted some bandages for Mac, 'cause Mac got paper cuts all over his fingers... 
 Again.

 What are we gonna do? 
 Well, answer him so he doesn't just barge in here. 
 Everything is perfectly fine, Daniel. 
 Now...Go away. 
 Don't say that. 
 You're supposed to be nurse Lily. 
 So what do I do? 
 Stall Daniel. 
 Make sure he doesn't come in here. 
 And what are you gonna do? 
 Save the day. Duh. 
 Hey. 
 Fancy meeting you here. 
 Are you okay? 
 Good. Great. Excellent. 
 Why do you ask? 
 You were just in the nurse's office. 
 You don't have that bad a cold, do you? 
 No, no, I'm fine. 
 Nurse Lily wanted me to give these to you uh... What was that? 
 What was what? 
 Ow! Hey, watch it. 
 Your big hairy hands are a lot stronger than I thought. 
 Is that Andi? 
 Uh...Yeah. 
 She's...Getting a shot, and she was nervous, so I came with her. 
 Yes. That is what's going on. 
 Listen. I'm glad I ran into you. 
 Because a bunch of us are going to the beach after school, and I wanted to see if you wanted to... 
 Hey, Emma. 
 Um, you need to get in here right now. 
 Hey, Andi, stay strong, all right? 
 You can do it. 
 Uh, okay, whatever. 
 Uh, beach. A bunch of people. 
 Love to. See you then. 
 Now, where did you hide her? 
 Ah, calm down. She's right over... 
 Over... 
 Um... 
 I swear, she was right there. 
 I mean... Two minutes. 
 I left you with the monkey for two minutes, and this is what you do? 
 I was just trying to help. 
 I gave her a bana... she's really strong, man. 
 I don't know how she opened that window. 
 What if somebody finds her? 
 She's my guardian. 
 Look. 
 You can just, you know, use your thing, and we'll get her right... 
 Andi, help me find her! 
 It had to be a monkey. Emma and Andi had a monkey. 
 No way. 
 Well, if it looks like a monkey, smells like a monkey, and sounds like a monkey... 
 It only sounded like a monkey. 
 I didn't see or smell any monkey. 
 That's too bad. I love the smell of monkey. 
 Why would Emma even have a monkey? 
 Who cares? 
 But if she does, I Hope she brings it to the beach. 
 I know something you don't know. 
 Sorry. Just always wanted to say that. 
 Well, what is it? 
 Sounds like your spell worked. 
 There's a monkey in the school. 
 Even if we do find her, I don't know how I'm going to change her back. 
 Why don't you just do your... 
 And reverse the spell? 
 Remember what Lily said before she went full monkey? 
 It's really hard to reverse another witch's spell. 
 I need the hexerin. 
 Oh, I like this version daring, bold, staring danger straight in the eyes... 
 Yeah, yeah, just cover for me if anyone asks where I am. 
 Especially... Your dad. 
 Exactly. 
 No, I mean, your dad. 
 Oh, no. 
 Quick. Act casual. 
 Why aren't you girls in class? 
 Oh, we have a really good explanation for this. 
 Go ahead, Emma, tell him our really good explanation. 
 Well, Andi wasn't feeling well, so I walked her to nurse Lily's office. 
 And what was wrong with you? 
 She had... 
 Indigestion. Ebola. 
 What she said. 
 What was that? 
 My throat gets real itchy and... 
 In fact, I'm not so sure I don't have ebola. 
 I think I need to go back to the nurse's office. 
 Great. I'll go with you. 
 Not so fast. 
 I'll take Andi. 
 Emma, you get back to class. Hmm? 
 Come on. 
 Come on, Lily. 
 Come on. 
 Hi, Daniel. 
 Hello. 
 Hey, Maddie. 
 Oh, you don't need to text me to tell me where you are. 
 I found you. 
 Oh, he's not. He's texting Emma. 
 Oh. 
 Okay. 
 Really? 
 Well, that's a great idea. 
 She's new in town. 
 She might not be able to find us. 
 Uh... 
 You were awfully nice about Daniel texting Emma right there. 
 That's because she's not going to get any of his text messages. 
 Emma hasn't learned her lesson and won't leave us alone, so turn my phone into Emma's phone. 
 What does it say? 
 "We're over by the pink lifeguard stand. 
 See you soon. Daniel." 
 Ooh, you're gonna get in trouble. 
 I'll take my chances. 
 "Too busy for you. Emma." 
 Too bad we couldn't find anything. 
 There's, like, thousands of spells in this book. 
 It's okay. 
 I think I can do it. 
 Let's see it. 
 Not a gnome or a fairy or even an elf. 
 Turn Lily back into her old self. 
 I don't know if this is such a good idea. 
 Relax. 
 I already told my mom I felt the ebola coming again. 
 And she called in sick. 
 And she believed that? 
 On a scale of all the things I've told my mom, this one barely registers. 
 Okay, so I'll go to school, find Maddie, and convince... 
 Or trick her into coming here and reversing the spell. 
 Then you and Lily, back to being human, will go to school. 
 And kiss my dreams of owning a pet monkey good-bye. 
 Then I'll go find Daniel and apologize for bailing on the beach yesterday. 
 I Hope he's not too mad. 
 He hasn't answered any of my messages. 
 Why are we talking about Daniel when there is a monkey in your room? 
 Andi, remember, don't go anywhere. 
 Stay here and don't open any windows. 
 Yeah, I got it. Now go. 
 Wish me luck. 
 You and I need to talk. 
 About what? 
 You know what. 
 I have no idea what you mean. 
 You need to change her back. 
 Change who back to what? 
 Oh, so it wasn't you who turned nurse Lily into a monkey? 
 Huh. 
 I guess you're not as amazing of a witch as I thought. 
 Of course it was me. 
 I did it. 
 I am that amazing. 
 I knew it! 
 You shouldn't have done that. 
 Now change her back. 
 If you're so desperate, then why didn't you just do it? 
 I've tried. 
 I'm not sure I know how. 
 So you can't reverse my spells? 
 I'm stronger than you. 
 I'm a better witch. 
 Who's the chosen one now? 
 How do you know about the chosen one? 
 I know way more about witch... 
 Stuff than you do. 
 Wait. 
 How do you know about it? 
 It's in that book, the hexerin. 
 I knew it! You have it! 
 And the nurse is helping you. 
 So not fair. 
 Do it, okay? 
 I'll break my own spell if you give me the hexogram. 
 Lily wouldn't want me to make that deal, even if it means she stays a monkey a little longer. 
 Or forever. 
 Good luck turning your precious nurse back into a human. 
 My spells are unbreakable. 
 I'll find a way. 
 It's probably in the hexogram. 
 I mean, the hexerin, and I have that. 
 Not for long. 
 I've waited and waited as long as I can stand. 
 Make the hexerin appear in my hand. 
 What gives? 
 I even got the name of the book right this time. 
 How many times have you tried that? 
 Only a couple. 
 Uh-huh. 
 But this'll be the first time I try this one. 
 
 
 
 Daniel! 
 Daniel? 
 Hey, Maddie. 
 Emma. 
 Walk me to class, just like old times? 
 Sure. Let's go. 
 See you. 
 Okay. 
 Crash! Hey, careful in there. 
 You better not be trying on any of Emma's clothes. 
 Hi, mom. 
 Yeah, I'm still feeling pretty sick. 
 That ebola virus is a real doozy. 
 Oh, I didn't go home because... 
 The school's nurse happens to be here. 
 Yeah, she's a friend of Emma's family. 
 You did? 
 And it said what? 
 But... okay, but... 
 Fine. 
 Yeah, we're busted. 
 Looks like we're going to school. 
 She looked it up. 
 Told you you could find anything on the Internet. 
 Hi, Daniel. 
 Hey. 
 I wanted to... 
 Look. 
 I'm kind of busy right now. 
 You are? 
 Yeah, I'm reorganizing my locker. 
 It's a very detailed and time-consuming process. 
 Sure. Sure. 
 I totally understand. 
 I reorganize mine once a week... 
 Twice if it's been a really busy week. 
 I just wanted to apologize for yesterday. 
 Things were just really, um... 
 Bananas. 
 And I'm so sorry I missed hanging out at the beach with you. 
 There is nothing I would have wanted to do more. 
 Emma, wait. 
 Yes? 
 What happened? 
 Why were you so, like, you know... 
 Oh, no. 
 "Oh, no," what? 
 Nothing. I... 
 I got to go. 
 Well, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's going on? 
 Sorry. It's an emergency. 
 But next time, I promise, I'll make it to the beach. 
 What if Mrs. Doyle checks to see if we really are going to the nurse's office and finds out we aren't? 
 There's no way for them to find out since the nurse is... Now, wait. 
 Is that who I think it is? 
 Stop her, Sophie. 
 Move. 
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
 I hate that game. 
 I never get it right. 
 I say we hold this monkey hostage and deliver her to Maddie; Then she won't be mad at me anymore. 
 Hey. 
 I wanted to talk to you about something. 
 For the last time, we're not changing our names to the copperfields. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 That's that. 
 It's not about that. 
 It's about Emma. 
 What about Emma? 
 Well... 
 I know you guys kind of had a thing, but she's been really nice to me lately. 
 And you know, we're both magicians, so we're kind of already compatible, so... 
 You want to ask her out? 
 Only if you don't. 
 No, man. 
 Go for it. 
 Thanks. 
 Maddie? 
 Fancy running into you here. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Uh... 
 I was called in to a parent/teacher conference. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 With who? 
 With mr.... Ms. Smith. 
 You came here to see Mr. alonzo, didn't you? 
 I came here to see all your teachers. 
 He just happens to be one of them. 
 Besides, I'm doing this for you. 
 I realized that the hexerin is probably in their house. 
 Why don't you just show up at their house with a pie and freak them out like you did to every other witch family in Miami! 
 Shouldn't you be in class? 
 This is school. 
 You have no authority over me here. 
 Excuse me. Excuse me. Hello. 
 This girl is not in class, and I want her prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 
 Mom! 
 Ta-ta, Maddie winkie. 
 "Ta-ta, Maddie winkie." 
 Andi, thank goodness I found you. 
 What's going on here? 
 We're holding nurse Lily until Maddie gets here. 
 That's monkey-napping. 
 No, it's answering when the opportunity knocks. 
 Wait, but where's nurse Lily? 
 She was feeling very misunderstood, so she took off. 
 C'est la vie. 
 Do it again. 
 What? 
 The fireball thing. 
 Shh! 
 Not here. 
 What if somebody sees? 
 They'd probably think it's awesome. 
 In fact, I bet you could get a lot of girls. 
 Yeah. 
 Really? 
 Absolutely. 
 Now, go talk to... 
 Hey. 
 Penny Dawson. 
 Rub your hands together, and watch her swoon. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Okay. 
 I'm ready. 
 Yes, you are. 
 Want to see something cool? 
 What's happening to your hands? 
 Sorry. Sorry. 
 What did you throw on me? 
 Well, where is she? 
 That's the thing. 
 We sort of lost her. 
 You what? 
 It was Sophie's fault. 
 We're not laughing anymore? 
 No! 
 I can't believe you lost her. 
 Come on, let's go find her. 
 I have a treat for you. 
 Here, nurse li-li-li-lily. 
 We have to get to Lily first. 
 You better Hope I get that monkey first. 
 Let's go check the nurse's office, since that's, like, home base for Lily. 
 We should look outside. 
 The monkey bars! 
 Sharks! Ready? 
 We sure are, coach. 
 What are you wearing? 
 Oh, it's, uh, my lucky sweater. 
 I just found it in my basement and figured it was the perfect time to bust it out. 
 Is that made of, uh... 
 Wool? 
 It's frozen. 
 I'm glad you asked me to stop by. 
 I didn't. 
 Because I personally wanted to invite you to join my book club. 
 That's very nice of you. 
 What kind of books do you read in your book club? 
 Fiction, non-fiction, mystery, non... Mystery... 
 And my personal favorite, poetry. 
 You like poetry? 
 Oh, yes, especially the kind that rhymes. 
 I love poetry too. 
 Okay, who is your favorite poet? 
 Uh, Dr. Seuss? 
 I love Dr. Seuss too. 
 I used to read all his books to Emma when she was younger. 
 Well, perfect. 
 We'll see you tonight then at 7:00. 
 Actually, tonight is make-your-own-pizza night at our place. 
 Oh, great. 
 We would love to have make-your-own-pizza book club night tonight at your house. 
 I'll bring the pepperoni, and you find every book in your house that has anything to do with rhyming whatsoever. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Fine. 
 Perfect. 
 Thank you. 
 Aha! There you are. 
 Aww! Are you afraid to come down? 
 She's a monkey, Emma. 
 She's not afraid of... 
 Heights. 
 A kanay... 
 In my school. 
 If he is a kanay, we could be in serious trouble. 
 Sorry to barge in, but we have a big problem. 
 There's a monkey loose in the school. 
 A what? 
 A monkey. 
 I called animal services. They should be here any minute. 
 You called them without my permission? 
 Yeah, it's standard practice. 
 We need to evacuate the school until they get here. 
 I'll decide that. 
 Julio, get me the student manual. 
 I already have it, and he's right. 
 We need to evacuate. 
 Everybody, out. 
 Evacuate. Evacuate. 
 This is a monkey emergency! 
 You got to do something. Change her back. 
 Last time I tried, it didn't work. 
 I think the monkey's in the cafeteria. 
 Emma, you're not supposed to be here. 
 Hurry. Go, go, go!
