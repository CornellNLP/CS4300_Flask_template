 Come on, Jax, one more for the record. 
 This better be good, Daniel, I have... 
 Jax?

 What are you? 
 I'm one of you. 
 You're a witch? 
 No, I'm a wizard. 
 Girls are witches, and boys are wizards. 
 I'm not a witch. 
 Oh, don't even try it. 
 I saw you hanging out with agamemnon and... 
 You know about the witches council? 
 Of course, everybody does. 
 You must be in trouble if they came to look for you. 
 I underestimated you. 
 I'm not in trouble. 
 Daniel! 
 Daniel's on his way here to meet me. 
 Quick, help me clean up! 
 Oh, that. 
 Yeah, that was me. 
 What? 
 You're pretty slow for a witch. 
 I cast a spell on his phone to send a text to you, so that you would meet me here so that we can talk wizard to witch. 
 You couldn't just ask me? 
 It was a lot more fun this way. 
 And while we're on the subject, you could have just told me you're a wizard instead of covering me with goo. 
 Unless you think it's more fun this way, too! 
 Mrs. Jones: What's that smell? 
 Oh, no, Mrs. Jones is coming. 
 Who cares? 
 I'll meet you in the cafeteria. 
 No, wait, I can't... 
 What happened in here? 
 Care to explain yourself, Ms. Alonso? 
 Emma? 
 Hi, Jax. 
 Did you just... 
 Eat an entire fern? 
 Yes, they're very high in vitamin d. 
 No, I meant how did you just appear out of nowhere? 
 I don't know. 
 How did you just appear out of nowhere? 
 Do people often just appear and disappear at this school? 
 Oh, yeah, all the time. 
 They do? 
 Yes, they appear when they enter a room. 
 They disappear when they exit... 
 Or when they go into the basement biology lab. 
 Nobody ever comes back from there. 
 Anyway, I was supposed to meet Emma here. 
 Have you seen her? 
 No, I'm looking for Maddie. 
 Have you seen her? 
 I've never met her. 
 I don't know what she looks like. 
 Oh, she looks like this. 
 Okay, I'll keep an eye out. 
 Just don't make that face if you see her. 
 You might get a... 
 What was that? 
 A strawberry smoothie to the face. 
 Okay. 
 Don't worry, I'll get it. 
 Um, what are you doing? 
 Stop. 
 Thanks for letting me change first, Mrs. Jones. 
 I'm just following school policy. 
 There's a policy for exploding science experiments covering a student in goo? 
 Article 311 in the student mishaps and messes section. 
 I bet that's a fun read. 
 I'll be quick. 
 Mr. Miller, hold it right there. 
 Hey, Mrs. Jones. 
 Hall pass? 
 Ugh, this is never gonna come out. 
 I'm gonna need some help. 
 I mean, I really don't have a choice. 
 It's a health hazard. 
 I could catch goo-aritus. 
 And what if it's contagious? 
 It could be an epidemic. 
 It's the only responsible thing to do. 
 How I'll get clean, I have no clue. 
 So for now, take off this goo. 
 Well it doesn't look counterfeit. 
 I just came out for a drink of water. 
 Emma? 
 You're clean. 
 I had wipes in my bag... Industrial strength. 
 That stuff came right off. 
 Weren't you taking to my dad's... I mean, the principal's office? 
 Let's go. 
 And you, Mr. Miller, I don't buy that "I'm just a nice guy going to get water" routine. 
 I saw what you did to principal Alonso. 
 I got my eye on you. 
 She's coming, she's coming! 
 Did she see you come in? 
 I don't think so. 
 I hid behind giganter Josh the whole way here. 
 I got her her favorite, strawberry, and my favorite, banana apple cherry tuna. 
 Ew! 
 Uh, well, a smoothie is a smoothie, right? 
 She's coming. 
 Quick, hide them in the stalls. 
 Panthers! 
 Both : Present! 
 Don't ever go into the bathroom without me! 
 Normally, we won't but... 
 But nothing. 
 You have a big problem. 
 I still can't control my powers. 
 They're all malfunctiony. 
 Really? 
 That's strange. 
 Why don't you try a spell right now? 
 I tried one right before I came in here. 
 I tried to give Andi big, giant rabbit ears, but she still has her same little squirrel ears. 
 Or... why don't you try casting... 
 A shoe spell? 
 Boring. 
 Plus I've just been stealing all my mom's shoes. 
 She's suddenly gotten so many new pairs. 
 Or how about a... Oh, yeah! 
 Or a smoothie spell? 
 Um, I am craving a smoothie. 
 Great, go for it. 
 Okay. 
 I don't have my magic powers down pat, so get me a strawberry smoothie stat. 
 See what I mean? 
 Well, maybe next time... oh! 
 What is this? 
 A smoothie? 
 It worked! 
 Sort of. 
 Ugh, it doesn't smell right. 
 See what I mean? 
 What, no, you ordered a strawberry smoothie, and it appeared. 
 It doesn't look like strawberry. 
 Sophie! 
 See, it's... ugh, de... licious. 
 You just need to work on your aim. 
 But still you made the smoothie appear. 
 What are you talking about? 
 What smoothie, where? 
 This smoothie. 
 Isn't it obvious? 
 I have my powers back. 
 What? 
 Here, you can have it. 
 And when I say the science lab better be clean, I mean clean. 
 Like I could eat an olive, marshmallow, pepperoni pizza off the floor clean. 
 Got it, dad. 
 Ssh, don't "got it, dad" me. 
 I'm principal Alonso to you. 
 Okay, principal Alonso. 
 Bye, sweetie. 
 Jax? 
 What are you doing here? 
 I'm helping you clean. 
 You're welcome. 
 Not like that, someone can see you. 
 I didn't mean to get you in trouble. 
 I just wasn't expecting to find a witch at iridium high, so I just wanted to talk, okay? 
 Okay, I have a lot of questions, too. 
 Of course, you first. 
 How... 
 I was kidding, me first. 
 What's the witches council doing here? 
 Wh... that's private. 
 Well, you must have done something really bad for them to come out. 
 I mean, when I got in trouble, I had to go to the council. 
 What kind of trouble? 
 Uh, no big deal. 
 Just a little overuse of magic during a basketball game. 
 What can I say? 
 I feel like lebron if lebron had invisible wings. 
 Oh. 
 Are there more of us? 
 Just me. 
 And Maddie, but she lost her powers. 
 So you, Maddie, Daniel and me? 
 Daniel's not a wizard. 
 I get it now. 
 I know why they're here. 
 You... you're dating a human? 
 Why would you ever do that? 
 Making Maddie believe she has powers is exhausting. 
 It's better than having her in a bad mood all day. 
 Good thing we got Diego to help us. 
 It was easy. 
 He likes Maddie. 
 Now hold still, it has to look like she's making you float. 
 Ugh, what are you doing? 
 Nothing! 
 Agh! 
 Sophie? 
 I'm fine. 
 The floor broke my fall. 
 Mom? 
 Is that chocolate I smell? 
 How did that get there? 
 Oh, cake! 
 You better explain how this got here. 
 Don't be mad, but we're making Maddie believe she has her powers back. 
 That's why I'm wearing this wig and Sophie's in a harness. 
 I can float like a cumulus cloud. 
 It's for science. 
 It's an experiment on positive reinforcement. 
 You should see what she does when the bell rings. 
 You two are making Maddie believe that she has her powers back? 
 It's the only way we could get her out of her funk. 
 That... Is the sweetest thing I have ever heard. 
 It is? 
 Yes. It is. 
 You two are wonderful friends, but let me ask you, is it working? 
 Oh, yeah, Maddie's totally desperate enough to believe us. 
 We've got all her spells covered... 
 Food, shoes and a flying Sophie. 
 All of them. 
 Unless she does a love spell again. 
 Love spell? 
 There... there's a love spell? 
 Tell me about the love spell. 
 First you need a pie to cast a spell on. 
 Oh, no, I have to bake the love spell. 
 Then he needs to eat the pie. 
 If you bake the pie, no one will ever eat it. 
 Store bought is the way to go. 
 Hi, Francisco. 
 Uh, fancy seeing you here. 
 I live here. 
 Oh, you are so funny. 
 [Laughing and snorting] 
 Um, are you... are you hungry? 
 I... I... I brought pie. 
 Does Maddie know my powers are back? 
 I don't think so. 
 Well, it's to be expected. 
 Mine came back. 
 Why wouldn't hers? 
 I say we call Lily and ask her what to do. 
 You just want to use the magic mobile phone. 
 Well, it just so happens it's the only way we can call her. 
 I say we leave her alone and let her train... 
 Whatever she's doing. 
 Fine. 
 Have you thought about breaking up with Daniel? 
 I'm not breaking up with him. 
 I mean, my mom was a witch and my dad's... a teacher. 
 Don't make that face. 
 No matter what your dad says, math is not a superpower. 
 Your mom gave up her powers, which you can't do. 
 You're the chosen one. 
 Well, I don't care what the council says or does. 
 I mean, what are they gonna do, break into my room and... 
 
 
 
 [Knocking at door] 
 Agh! 
 Relax, it's just me. 
 Can I come in? 
 Sure. 
 Hey, you're interrupting girl time. 
 I thought you hated girl time. 
 I did, until Emma let me bring my engine propeller over. 
 I fix it, while she glues pictures on cardboard. 
 I'm scrapbooking. 
 Yeah, that. 
 Hey, Andi, can I talk to Emma for a minute? 
 Sure. 
 All right, I'm going to the kitchen. 
 Come on, hex, keep me company. 
 What did you want to talk about? 
 I need to ask you something. 
 And I want you to be completely honest with me. 
 Okay. 
 Are you powers back? 
 I'm seriously sweating under here. 
 I'm getting a major wedgie. 
 I can't stand here all day. 
 All of this lying, it's making my hives come back. 
 Try not to think of it as lying. 
 We're doing this for Maddie, remember? 
 I can't just stand in here all day. 
 I'm a very busy guy with places to go, people to see, fireballs to throw. 
 Oh, please, you'd rather be here with Maddie. 
 And don't try to say that's not true. 
 That's... that's not true. 
 Wow, that looks really bad. 
 You're really not a natural liar. 
 No, you're not. 
 But Katie is. 
 What? 
 Look, she thinks that she has her powers back, and she doesn't. 
 It's... it's just wrong. 
 Oh, stop getting all right and wrong with me. 
 Maddie's gonna be here any second. 
 Get back in your little hiding place. 
 I'm not accusing you of lying, I've just never seen anyone de-goo that fast before. 
 You've seen a lot of de-gooing? 
 Hello, I live with the t-3. 
 De-gooing is like a daily occurrence in our house. 
 So you're a de-gooing expert? 
 Uh, you could say that. 
 Look, the point is... Wait, what was the point? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 You came out of that bathroom super fast and super clean. 
 I... 
 I just want the truth. 
 Are your powers back? 
 Daniel, I'm gonna be honest with you. 
 Good. 
 The goo wasn't really that sticky. 
 It had hydro-cloro-patasimite in it, which makes it super easy to clean up. 
 Hydro-clora, what-a? 
 It's the chemical compound they put in that off off darn goo cleaning stuff. 
 That's what I was trying to make in the lab when my beaker exploded. 
 So you were covered in anti-goo goo? 
 Exactly. 
 You don't have to worry, Daniel. 
 I'm still just me. 
 You're right, I'm sorry. 
 I just get so worried that your powers are going to back and ruin everything. 
 I didn't mean it like that. 
 Daniel, with our without powers, I'm still a witch. 
 I know. 
 But without your powers, you're safe from... 
 Super psycho 400-year-old witches disguised as principals who want to steal my powers? 
 Yes. 
 Okay, I gotta go before your dad sees me. 
 I'll see you later. 
 I can't see anything from here. 
 We have to leave it open a little. 
 No, that'll ruin it. 
 Maddie : I'm home. 
 She's here. 
 We're in here, Maddie. 
 Oh, great, I need some help from my bestest friends ever with my, uh... spells. 
 Of course, we're here to help you. 
 Oh, thanks, you're such good friends. 
 Ready? 
 I don't have a broom, but still want Sophie to float around the room. 
 You did it! 
 I'm flying! 
 She's sometimes such a shady lady, so make it rain only on Katie. 
 Oh, wow, yeah, it worked. 
 We should stop now. 
 Wind! 
 Agh! 
 Agh! 
 Smoothies! 
 Agh! 
 More wind! 
 Both : [Screaming] 
 Oh, stop, I know it's you. 
 All of you. 
 You know? 
 Of course I know. 
 There's a rope running through the living room! 
 Hi, there. 
 Whoa, what are you doing? 
 Somebody could see you. 
 Are you always this jittery? 
 No, sometimes I'm even jittery-er. 
 You just can't be too careful using magic. 
 Look, I thought about your disappearing problem, and I think I can help. 
 I don't think so. 
 My guardian's tried and tried, and nothing's worked. 
 Splash, every single time. 
 The pool, really? 
 Well, if you're gonna screw it up, at least you screw it up in style. 
 Boy, are you glad you met me. 
 I am. 
 Yes, your spells are all over the place. 
 You obviously aren't that strong. 
 I workout... sometimes. 
 And scrapbooking takes a lot of upper-body strength. 
 Oh, you meant strong witch wise. 
 Listen, whatever you did, watch out, because they mean business. 
 And they will take your powers away from you if they want. 
 What was that? 
 I'm still dizzy from all the floating yesterday. 
 So you're not upset? 
 That you fooled me, yes. 
 That I don't have my powers, yes. 
 But your lie just gave me a plan. 
 What plan? 
 Get proxy on the phone. 
 Who? 
 Wind and rain boy. 
 You mean, Diego. 
 Why do you call him proxy? 
 You'll find out. 
 Now, get proxy on the phone. 
 Stat! 
 In conclusion, you'll follow Maddie around and do her spells for her. 
 The element-related spells. 
 I'll take care of the rest. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Let me see if I have this straight. 
 You want me to follow Maddie around? 
 Yes. 
 And use my powers so that she can get her away? 
 Yes. 
 And spend almost every waking moment together? 
 I guess. 
 Uh, I told you he wouldn't like it. 
 I'm in. 
 I still don't know understand why you invited them over. 
 I thought you didn't like Mrs. van pelt. 
 Not like her? 
 What's not to like? 
 Well, you said she was loud, dramatic and had hair the size of Texas. 
 I'm just quoting you on the last one. 
 Ha, that's... what is it that you kids say, cray cray? 
 I don't get what we're doing here. 
 You promised that I wouldn't have to ever come here again. 
 Maddie, behave, this is important. 
 You don't get it, mom. 
 She might make me... scrapbook with her. 
 Maddie, stop it or I will... 
 Or what, you can't ground me? 
 I can now. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Nothing, just that I... 
 And how'd you have time to go to the mall, hairdresser's and nail salon? 
 [Stammering] 
 Uh, dinner's ready. 
 Oh, thank goodness. 
 You sit here... 
 Okay. 
 Across from me. 
 You better not tell anybody I'm here. 
 Why would I? 
 I made your favorite. 
 Caviar pizza. 
 Ah, delicious! 
 Girls, um, Ursula and I have something to tell you. 
 Something amazing! 
 Oh, you're moving back to new jersylvania? 
 Or wherever it is you're from. 
 No, we are in love. 
 Both : No, you're not. 
 We are. 
 We are! 
 And we want to get married as soon as possible. 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 Oh, isn't this wonderful, girls? 
 You're gonna be sisters.
