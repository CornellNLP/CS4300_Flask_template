 Hold on. 
 The wind is almost... 
 Gone. 
 Wai... wait! 
 So the entrance to the witches' council is just behind some lockers at my school? 
 A guardian can set up a door to the witches' council wherever she wants. 
 Sweet! 
 When I become a full guardian, I'm gonna put one at the bottom of the pool. 
 Then I'll jump off the diving board straight into the portal... 
 Andi, I'm sorry, but the witches' council won't let non-witches in. 
 Even if that particular non-witch is acting as a guardian? 
 An unofficial guardian. 
 Yes, even then. 
 Yeah, well, I didn't want to join anyway. 
 Just wanted the cool gadgets. 
 I got to go. 
 Some X-ray goggles would be great! 
 (Magical tone) 
 I really need to change my ringtone. 
 "Yes, Lily thinks the principal is"... 
 How should I put this? 
 "An uber-wacko super bad witch. 
 Gone to the council to warn them." 
 Ah! Warn them about what?

 (Microphone feedback) 
 Turn that off! 
 Now! 
 Okay, okay. 
 Jeez, sorry, Daniel. 
 The floor is yours for now. 
 Thanks. 
 Uh, this is a song I wrote.

 You did an excellent job rotating my umbrella in time with the sun, just like old times. 
 I'm glad, Maddie, but look, I need to be honest. 
 We won't be going out anymore. 
 What? But you asked me to beach ball. 
 I know. 
 Look, I don't want to lead you on, but I'm interested in someone else. 
 What? 
 And you better not say... Emma. 
 That's who I meant when I said, "you better not say." 
 Wow, your face is really red. 
 Like, uh, crazy fire engine red. 
 I should probably go and let you, um, cool off. 
 Okay, bye. 
 Maddie Winky! 
 I... 
 Is something burning? 
 (Gasps) Oh! 
 So tell me the truth, Andrea. 
 How do you know about witches if you aren't one? 
 I know all about magic and witches and the magic realm because... 
 I'm a guardian. 
 So you better stand back, or I'll... I'll guardify you. 
 If you were a guardian, you'd know that you can smell a witch a mile away. 
 You just smell like car oil and sweat. 
 Oh, why, thank you. 
 Where is the real guardian, the nurse? 
 The nurse is a guardian? 
 No. 
 No more lies. 
 If the nurse went to see the council, she must have set up an entrance nearby. 
 Tell me where the entrance to the witches' council is, or I will turn you into a frog permanently. 
 You'll turn me into a frog. 
 Is that the best you can do? 
 Frog is my preferred mode of punishment. 
 But for you, I can make an exception. 
 Oh, then might I suggest a saber-toothed tiger? 
 Polar bear? 
 Saber-toothed polar tiger bear! 
 How about I just turn you into a cricket and feed you to my other frogs? 
 Oh, I see. 
 You're low-balling me. 
 My dad says any offer is just a jumping off point for negotiations. 
 But okay, I'll jump down from saber-toothed polar tiger bear, and maybe we could do a wolf-owl hybrid or... 
 Silence! 
 This is your last chance or... 
 (Shrieks) 
 Wh... this is so cool. 
 I can swim so much faster now. 
 Thank you! 
 Not if I finish the job. 
 What? 
 Thud! 
 You're back! 
 I guess you really are mine. 
 Hey, wait. 
 I wasn't trying to be possessive or anything. 
 I was just saying... 
 Oh, no. 
 You're going to look so good in green with Amber spots and lots of warts. 
 Frogs don't have warts. Toads do. 
 For the last time, where is the door to the council? 
 Student council? 
 Well, you go straight down the hall and make a left. 
 Then you make a right. 
 Then you make another right and th... 
 Wha... 
 Hex? 
 Maddie, I finally figured it out. 
 I'm your guardian. 
 Whoo-hoo, congratulations. 
 I have to start guardianing you, stat. 
 Can you start tomorrow? 
 And you can't use "stat." That's my thing. 
 Yes, I can. 
 I'm your mother. 
 And I'm your guardian, and as your guardian, I get to tell you what to do. 
 (Sighs) Look, mom. 
 I had a terrible day. 
 I just want to sleep. 
 No. 
 What? 
 No. 
 I am your guardian, and we have an eclipse to get ready for. 
 (Thunder rumbling) 
 (Sighs) 
 What's the point? 
 We lost the book, we have no idea how to steal Emma's powers back, and Daniel dumped me. 
 Oh, Maddie Winky, who cares about Daniel? 
 When you become the chosen one, you can make a hundred Daniels. 
 Oh, Maddie, you will be the chosen one. 
 And when you are, you will give me powers. 
 And together we will rule... 
 North Miami. 
 So Maddie just wanted to talk? 
 About what? 
 Nothing in particular. 
 Why are you so curious? 
 Why is everyone so curious about me all of a sudden? 
 I'm not; It was just totally weird to see Maddie being nice to you. 
 And what do you mean by "everyone"? 
 Good morning. 
 I can still see you. 
 What is she doing? 
 You don't even want to know. 
 I couldn't even tell you, because I don't even know myself. 
 (Over loudspeaker) Mr. rueda. 
 Please report to the office immediately. 
 (Whines) 
 (Shouts) 
 Do you know why you're here? 
 Uh, my grades? 
 The stink bombs that somebody made in chemistry class? 
 The special mustard in the cafeteria? 
 You're here because I hear you're gifted. 
 (Laughs) 
 What? 
 Wait, you definitely heard wrong, because I'm in remedial everything. 
 Even lunch. I have to use a spork. 
 Not that kind of gifted. 
 The kind where you can do tricks. 
 Oh, well, uh, I can do a back flip belly flop into the pool, and I can burp the national anthem, and I can eat 12 hot dogs before I barf. 
 That's not what I'm talking about. 
 You know what I mean. 
 What? 
 I know you're a kanay, so drop the act. 
 You? 
 You know about kanays? 
 Are you one too? 
 No, I'm not a kanay, thank goodness. 
 Oh. 
 You don't like kanays too? 
 Why? 
 Well, Julio was telling me about how witches don't like kanays. 
 Julio. He did? 
 Did he tell you anything else about witches? 
 Nah, but it did take me a while to believe that they existed. 
 But then I thought to myself, "I exist, so, like, why can't they?" 
 Then I got all, "what does it mean to exist?" 
 And "are we really here?" 
 Then my arms got all red and hot. 
 It was... And then what did you do? 
 I ate some nachos and stopped thinking about it. 
 
 
 
 Hey, em. 
 Andi! Finally. 
 What's going on? 
 Not so loud. I don't want to call any attention to myself. 
 Then that hat and those sunglasses have to go. 
 You look like Maddie's eviler twin. 
 Gross. 
 Why didn't you answer my calls? 
 My phone could be tapped. 
 Listen, I'm not so sure we should be in school today. 
 Oh, don't start with that again. 
 I am not skipping school  to play middle earth domination, fourth edition. 
 Or fifth. Or sixth. 
 But fifth edition is so worth it. 
 But that's not what I meant. 
 Lily and I found out who the principal is, and... 
 And? 
 Let me finish my dramatic pause, em. 
 Andi! 
 It's not good. 
 She's some kind of cray-cray-in-a-bad-way witch. 
 Scary enough to send Lily running to the council for help. 
 Oh, no. 
 I mean, good that Lily went to get help but bad that the principal is cray-cray in a bad way. 
 It gets worse. 
 Look what she did to me. 
 (Laughs) 
 That's not funny. 
 Okay, I liked them at first, but they're not very practical. 
 You're right. It's terrible. 
 Just "te-web-ble." 
 Seriously, now? 
 Don't worry; I can fix your hands. 
 How did you get away? 
 Same way I got to school today: The hex. 
 So now that you know, what are you gonna do to me? 
 Do to you? Nothing. 
 I just want you to know that I know in case you need someone to confide in. 
 Thanks, but I'm fine. 
 So what can you do with your powers? 
 Not that much. I can just freeze water. 
 Fascinating. Show me. 
 What? Here? 
 Now? Yes. 
 Here. Now. 
 No, I can't. 
 You can, and you will. 
 (Picture frame scratches) 
 What was that? 
 Okay, I'll show you. 
 But first, uh, I need to get water from the cafeteria. 
 That's the best water to freeze. 
 And then I'll unfreeze it with a heat ball. 
 You can control fire already? 
 A little. Julio's been teaching me. 
 And then they call me weird. 
 I kind of miss my webbed hands. 
 You said they're not very practical. 
 Yeah, but it's like that old saying: (Speaking Spanish) 
 "Everyone misses their webbed hands once they're gone." 
 I speak Spanish, and that's not a saying. 
 Yeah? Well, it should be. 
 Are you sure this is safe? 
 I feel like we should be hiding from the principal, not hanging out on her own turf. 
 Lily told me that if anything goes wrong to keep coming to school and act like nothing's wrong. 
 Hmm, interesting tactic: Safety in numbers. 
 But what are we gonna do about the you-know-what? 
 We keep it with us at all times, at least until after the eclipse. 
 What about the eclipse? 
 Danny. 
 Uh, Julio. Uh, hey. 
 Did those lockers just move? 
 What? Oh, yeah. 
 We really got to get new ones. 
 These are so rickety, always moving around, about to tip over. 
 No, there was a space between them, and then they moved like automatic sliding doors, it must've been a portal. 
 A portal? 
 Have you been watching science fiction movies or something? 
 Okay, okay. Let's cut the charade. 
 I know you know I know, and you know I know, you know? 
 If I only knew what you were talking about... That you're a guardian. 
 And don't try to deny it. 
 You'll just waste more time I'm sure you don't have, with the eclipse coming and all. 
 I... 
 Yeah, you got me. 
 I am. 
 The eclipse is a week away, right? 
 What? How do you know about that? 
 It's been all over the news. 
 It has? 
 He's talking about the actual event, em. 
 The sun covers the moon. That's it. 
 Oh, yeah. Right. 
 Sorry, I... um... 
 Actually, that's not it at all. 
 It's a lunar eclipse, where the earth blocks the sun and then the moon. 
 It goes dark. I got it. 
 (Sneezes) 
 No, it turns a dark orange. 
 Plus, this year, it coincides with the winter solstice, the darkest night of the year. 
 You are such a geek, really. 
 Sometimes I don't know why you're even popular. 
 Anyway, so I know this cool spot by the beach where... 
 Are you asking her out? 
 Um, hey, Maddie. 
 Good morning, class. 
 Everyone, take your seats. 
 I must be losing my hearing, because I just thought I heard Daniel asking Emma out. 
 (Shouting) Can you hear me? 
 Katie! 
 Yep, you heard him just fine. 
 Everyone, settle down. We have a lot to do. 
 Let's continue with the oral presentations. 
 Andi and Daniel, you're up. 
 Wish me luck. 
 Luck. 
 (Mockingly) Luck. Ew. 
 My anger for you is at a premium. 
 Now you'll sound like you swallowed some helium. 
 (Sneezes) 
 (Clears throat) 
 Watch this. It's about to get really good. 
 Our fathers brought forth... 
 (Clears throat) 
 (In high-pitched voice) On this continent a new nation conceived in liberty. 
 (Stifled laughter) 
 Impressive falsetto, Daniel. 
 Could you maybe proceed without it? 
 What are you doing? 
 Nothing. 
 Let's start over. 
 You're right. This is getting good. 
 (Both giggle) 
 (High-pitched voice) Four score and seven years ago... 
 Seriously, Daniel. Cut it out. 
 Go, Danny! 
 Now we are engaged in a great civil war. 
 (Laughter) 
 Are you imitating me? 
 No! 
 (Laughter) 
 (Dramatic music) 
 So if you know Diego's a kanay, then I assume your mother knows. 
 Why would you assume that? 
 Do I think I tell my mother everything? 
 Like I'm some kind of mama's boy? 
 Let me tell you something. I'm not. 
 I'm my own man. 
 And I assume she knows about me too. 
 Yes, she knows that you're a powerless witch, that you're a guardian. 
 And she knows who the chosen one is? 
 Yep. Math teacher's daughter. 
 Ri... wrong. 
 Then it must be the van pelt girl. 
 No, no. I didn't say that. 
 It's her. (Laughs) 
 We've been after the wrong girl the whole time. 
 Look, Julio. 
 You don't know what you're dealing with. 
 This can get very bad for everyone. 
 Nice try. You almost fooled us. 
 (Sighs) I hope I just bought you some time, Emma. 
 Hey, Lily. 
 There you are. We've been looking for you. 
 Are you going somewhere? 
 Lock the door. I don't know how much time I have. 
 Where's Emma? 
 Uh, fixing Daniel's soprano. 
 Long story. 
 Are you abandoning us? 
 No. 
 Not exactly. 
 The council took me off Emma's case, but... 
 What? Now? 
 The eclipse is less than a week away. 
 I'm not leaving Miami. 
 I just can't work in this school. 
 I don't have the council's protection anymore. 
 I-I don't know what that means. 
 It means the principal can get to me, turn me into a houseplant, a frog, transport me to the moon. 
 Cool. 
 I mean, oh, no. 
 Listen, Andi. 
 There's something you should know in case I go missing. 
 The principal isn't just any witch. 
 The principal is a chosen one. 
 I thought Emma was the chosen one. 
 She is. It's complicated. 
 At first, I thought the principal was just a disgraced witch that had managed to steal her powers back little by little, but she's much more than that. 
 But the... then they should be sending extra guardians, not taking her only one away. 
 (Knob jiggling) 
 Nurse Lily, are you in there? 
 (Knob jiggling) 
 I can hear you. 
 Open the door. 
 Hello, Lily. 
 Going somewhere? 
 Leaving us so soon? 
 And without giving two weeks' notice. 
 Not very professional of you as a nurse or a guardian. 
 So you know. 
 Yes. 
 And my son tells me you went to see the council. 
 I did, and I told them who you are. 
 Oh, and let me guess. 
 The council told you to stay away. 
 They're wrong. 
 It's the rules. 
 There can be only one chosen one. 
 Hence the name "chosen one." 
 It's not you. 
 Maddie van pelt has my powers, and I will get them back. 
 I'll stop you. I... 
 Oh, is that right? 
 You and your army of flies? 
 (Laughs) 
 I don't get it. 
 (Magic warbling) 
 Get it now? 
 (Laughing) 
 (Dramatic music) 
 (Sighs gleefully)
