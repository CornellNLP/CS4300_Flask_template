 Emma, what was that sound? 
 What sound? 
 That. Are you okay? 
 Yeah, we're just rehearsing for drama class. 
 Andi was cast as a goat. 
 You signed up for drama? 
 I thought you hated drama. 
 Ever since you were in that second grade play and had that little accident. 
 Dad. 
 No, Andi. 
 What was that? 
 Nothing. 
 Just more rehearsing. 
 Andi, no. 
 Don't go see the fortune teller at the forbidden Lake. 
 No, Andi. That's my chemistry homework. 
 Emma, you know I trust you, but... 
 Just a second, dad. 
 Bad goat! 
 Bad goat. 
 Okay, I'm gonna give you to the count of five, and then I'm coming in, okay? 
 One... 
 Two... 
 Give it back. 
 Three... 
 Four... 
 I know goats eat everything, even candy, but I'd prefer if this one once again became Andi.

 Okay. What's going on? 
 Is she eating paper? 
 She was, uh, hungry. 
 Oh, so she just decided to eat paper. 
 Well, it's my chemistry homework, so it's full of calcium, sodium, and magnesium. 
 Get it? 
 It has minerals, so... Never mind. 
 Is my cooking really that bad? 
 Oh, that was so close. 
 Andi, I'm so sorry I turned you into a goat. 
 I didn't think my spell would actually work. 
 I Hope you're not mad. 
 That was awesome. 
 Let's try another one. 
 Turn me into a cheetah. 
 No, wait. A komodo dragon. 
 No, wait. A saber-toothed tiger. 
 Let's try this one more time. 
 I'll even start the spell off for you this time, okay? 
 Ready? 
 With mother's help, I'll never fail. 
 Turn this purse into a... 
 A backpack. 
 Maddie, you need to concentrate. 
 No, I need a mani. 
 This color is so two hours ago. 
 You know what? 
 If you learn to cast spells, you won't even have to worry about your nail color anymore, because you can just cast a spell every time you want to change nail polish. 
 Ooh, really? 
 Yes. 
 I love that. 
 Yay! Okay, here we go. 
 Okay, concentrate. 
 Ready? 
 With mother's help, I'll never fail. 
 Turn this purse into a... 
 A belt? 
 A bracelet? A tiara? 
 Okay, you know it has to rhyme with "fail." 
 And you couldn't just say that? 
 Maybe I should just tell my dad what's happening, and he can give me some help or something. 
 Yeah, what's he gonna do? 
 Call the witch doctor? 
 Get it? 'Cause you're a witch. 
 I got it. 
 But maybe my dad actually knows what's happening, and he can explain it to me. 
 I say we keep it to ourselves until we've it all figured out. 
 Now let's go over what we know. 
 Not much except that each time something weird happened, I was extremely nervous. 
 Aha. The pressure. 
 I do my best homework when I'm under pressure. 
 Homework. 
 I forgot to redo it after the goat fiasco. 
 What am I going to do? 
 About what? 
 Daniel, hey. 
 It's just, I don't have my chemistry homework. 
 What happened to it? 
 A goat ate it. 
 How's it going? 
 I'm almost done. 
 You better hurry. Lunch is almost done too. 
 No, I'm starving. 
 Keep working. 
 I have an idea. 
 Heads up. 
 Great catch. 
 Nice. Keep it going. 
 Okay, you're really good at this. 
 Like, freakishly good. 
 I'm glad all those summers at grape-catching camp are paying off. 
 What's going on? 
 I think they might be on a date except we're at school, so I'm going to guess lunch. 
 Daniel, we need to talk. 
 I'm busy. 
 You can't be busy. 
 You're alone. 
 Actually, I'm here. 
 So it's the perfect time to talk. 
 This is exactly why we're not getting back together, because you can be so rude. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 How are you? 
 What you working on? 
 Hey, give it back. 
 Somebody already ate it once, and I'm not losing it again. 
 Maddie... 
 Hey, hey. Hey. 
 So you ready for tryouts? 
 I guess. 
 Is there a lot of competition? 
 Nah, just one. 
 G-gigantor Joshua? 
 Yep. 
 And no one wants him on the team, so you're our only Hope. 
 No pressure. 
 Stop it. 
 You're gonna tear it. 
 Then let go. 
 It's my homework. 
 You tore it. 
 It's okay. 
 She didn't tear up all of the answers. 
 Maddie, why would you do that? 
 I just wanted to check her answers and make sure they were correct because I'm such a generous person. 
 Good one. 
 Ooh! 
 Wait, I have a stapler in my locker. 
 What part of stay away from Daniel do you not understand? 
 Look, I don't know what your damage is, but you can't tell me who I can and can't be friends with. 
 I think Daniel really likes her. 
 No, he doesn't. 
 Actually, a lot of people like her. 
 Then it's time for everyone to give her the cold shoulder. 
 For now and forever and without a doubt, everyone in school will freeze Emma out. 
 Emma? 
 It's an ice sculpture of Emma. 
 It looks exactly like her. 
 What? 
 That's not what I mean to... but this works too. 
 I couldn't find my stapler, but I guess this will work. 
 Emma? 
 What's wrong with her? 
 Ha! Where do I start? 
 Number one, her shoes are heinous. 
 Guys! Guys, over here. 
 I need some help. 
 Whoa. What happened to her? 
 She's dripping. 
 See? She's thawing. 
 Cured. Now, Daniel, back to us. 
 We have to get her to the nurse's office. 
 Don't worry, guys. 
 I've seen this before. 
 Come on. She's not frozen. 
 She has an inverted cold. 
 Some hot towels, some tea, Shell be good as new. 
 Inverted cold? I've never heard of that. 
 Well, are you a doctor? 
 A nurse? A cold and flu enthusiast? 
 I didn't think so. 
 Let's go. Wait. 
 You're new here, aren't you? 
 I'm Mac. Mac Davis. 
 Lily. Nurse Lily. 
 And don't even think about it. 
 Let's go. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Come on. No. 
 All right, Emma, I'll get you thawed out in a jiffy. 
 Now where's that blowtorch? 
 Come on, Joe, we've been over this. 
 Floating is not swimming. 
 My turn. 
 One minute, Joshua. 
 I want to get everyone out of the pool before you... 
 I said now. 
 He's not shark material, Julio. 
 Maybe not, but we have to give everyone a shot. 
 I just need to figure out who's gonna race him. 
 I am. 
 Just in time. All right. 
 Let's go. Ready? 
 Okay, I just need to get my pants off. 
 No time, no time. Good luck. 
 What? 
 Do you know how this happened? 
 Well, I was catching grapes Daniel was tossing at me, like... then Maddie came over and was all, "daniel is mine." 
 Then suddenly I was all, "help me." 
 Maddie Van Pelt. I should have guessed. 
 You know her? 
 I know that she's a witch. 
 Like you. 
 But I think Maddie might turn out to be a bad witch. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Yes, you do. 
 You think I'm a witch? 
 I know you are. 
 But don't worry. So am I. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 I was sent here to protect you and help you become a better witch. 
 Ugh, what's in this tea, arugula? 
 Because it's disgusting. 
 You drank three cups of it. 
 Well, my taste buds were frozen, but now they're fine. 
 And I'm fine. 
 And I've got to go. 
 Emma, wait. I'm telling the truth. 
 I'm your guardian. 
 Honestly, I don't have any powers, none at all. 
 See? I'm all b-b-b-better. 
 I don't n-n-n-need you. 
 If you are who we think you are, you do need me, or you might lose your powers during the next eclipse. 
 Let's go! 
 Tony, come on. 
 Yes, yes, yes, yes! 
 Come on, come on! 
 
 
 
 That's what I'm talking about. 
 We're saved. 
 Congratulations. 
 You made the team. 
 Thanks, mom. 
 Sharks are a menace. 
 They're too strong as a group, so I'll have to take them down one by one. 
 But which one first? 
 Ah, here we go. 
 Mac Davis. 
 Perfect. 
 Mac Davis, I'll start it with you. 
 Maddie, calm down. 
 Anger is not good for your complexion. 
 Is that why her face is so splotchy? 
 That girl is ruining everything. 
 She's gonna get it. 
 I think freezing her solid would count as her getting it. 
 But it's got to be something that makes her stay away from Daniel for good. 
 Emma ignores everything that I say, so make a huge storm that will send her away. 
 ? 
 Maddie! 
 That was awesome. 
 So do they know? 
 No, Mrs. Van Pelt. 
 We definitely don't know that Maddie is a witch. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 You three realize you have got to keep this a secret, right? 
 They won't say anything. 
 Good, because we're going to need them. 
 You have spells to cast. 
 You said I wasn't ready. 
 I know, but we're running out of time. 
 Everyone listen carefully. 
 So she said she was going to freeze you out, and then you froze. 
 Glue gun. 
 Like a Popsicle. 
 If we know of two witches at iridium high, do you think there could be more? 
 Sure. Why not? 
 I want an extra large pizza with lots of meat-sa. 
 Great rhyming. 
 Just checking. You never know. 
 Tweezers. 
 That would be so cool if you were a witch. 
 Then you could help me deal with Maddie and her spells. 
 Power drill. 
 Well, I may not have magic powers, but I'll do everything I can to help you keep yours. 
 Aw, thanks. 
 That's so sweet. 
 Yeah, yeah. Don't get all Kumbaya on me. 
 Now, Maddie, just like we practiced. 
 Change her clothes. 
 I want a blue blouse. 
 Turn Sophie into a mouse. 
 No! No! 
 I thought everything would look gigantic, but it's all the same size. 
 No, wait. 
 Maddie's tin definitely looks much bigger. 
 What? 
 Why didn't it work? 
 You said all I had to do is rhyme. 
 Because that's the structure of the spell. 
 You need the concentration and the intention behind it to make it work. 
 Fine. 
 Then I intend to make you all only two feet, six inches tall. 
 Whew! It's okay, you guys. 
 Maddie's still terrible at casting spells. 
 Okay, let's get started. 
 Andi. 
 Okay, everybody, we have a new shark in the water, Tony meyer. 
 But before you can race, you're gonna have to go through the terrible three's tunnel of doom. 
 Ooh. 
 I don't think I like the sound of that. 
 We're gonna be timing how long exact... 
 Don't worry. It'll be fun. 
 Just depending on your definition of fun. 
 Stop interrupting the announcer. 
 We're gonna be timing how long it takes for you to find five inflatable sharks in the tunnel of doom. 
 Ooh. 
 Without setting off any of the traps set by the terrible three. 
 In the tunnel of doom. 
 What's your problem? 
 Can I look at the tunnel before I go in? 
 No. Good luck. 
 Your time starts now. 
 Shh. 
 Crash! 
 That's gonna hurt. 
 Can we just go back to why my mouse spell didn't work? 
 It was so easy when I froze Emma into an ice sculpture. 
 You what? 
 Actually, that's very impressive. 
 Maybe we... I mean you... actually do stand a chance of stealing the chosen one's powers. 
 I do? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 But you absolutely must master undoing other witches' spells in case you have to have a duel with the chosen one when the time comes. 
 A duel? 
 Ooh, what am I going to wear? 
 Spells first. 
 Appropriate duel attire later. 
 Hi, picking up a pizza order under alonzo. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hello, Emma. 
 Ah! 
 What? Are you following me? 
 No, I just happened to see you leave your house, happened to see you head this way, so I headed this way. 
 Okay, I'm following you. 
 I really need to talk to you. 
 About what? 
 That inverted cold you had. 
 That. Well, I'm all better. 
 See, just a normal girl going about her normal life picking up some normal pizza. 
 One extra-large cheese, pineapple, spinach, and anchovies on a whole-wheat crust? 
 Thank you. 
 What? You never had an all five food groups pizza? 
 I know. I know. 
 You just want to be ordinary to fit in. 
 But you're not ordinary. 
 You're extraordinary. 
 It's overwhelming at first. 
 But I'm here to help you. Tell me. 
 Have you found your signature gesture yet? 
 My what? 
 Your signature gesture. 
 Every witch has one. It's how you cast a spell. 
 Oh. No. 
 But somehow I was still able to turn Andi into a goat. 
 I mean... Busted. 
 No. I meant something different. 
 That was just a metaphor for... 
 You already did an animal transformation? 
 That's impressive. 
 And supports our theory about you. 
 What theory? 
 That you are the chosen one. 
 ♪ Are you ready for this♪

 Man, really breezed through this tunnel, didn't I? 
 Now all that's left is to ring that victory bell. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Welcome to the team. 
 So as my guardian, what do you do? 
 I teach you all about magic. 
 I protect you until after the eclipse. 
 Want some? 
 Mm. Not bad. 
 And what's so special about the eclipse? 
 Its the only time another witch, if she has all the right tools, can steal the chosen one's powers. 
 That sounds dangerous for the chosen one, I mean, who is definitely not me. 
 I know it's a lot to take in. 
 Just take some time to process it all. 
 Do you need a lift home or something? 
 My dad can give you a ride. 
 Nah. I'm just going to ride my broom home. 
 Is that a real thing? 
 No. I'm kidding. 
 Don't believe everything you see on tv about witches. 
 Right, except for all that stuff about spells and magical powers. 
 Okay. Except for that. 
 I'll see you in school. 
 I'm sorry about your mother. 
 I've heard great things about her. 
 My mother? 
 Wait. She was a... 
 I'm excited to see Andi race. 
 I really want to support her, especially after I turned her into a... 
 Into? 
 Into a scrapbooker. 
 She was pretty upset. 
 Hands in. 
 Who are we? 
 The sharks! 
 What do we do? 
 We rule the water! 
 Go sharks! 
 Sharks! 
 Oh, oh, oh, whoa. 
 Oh. Ah. What a coincidence. 
 Hello, neighbor. 
 Hi. 
 What? 
 You didn't think he was waving at you, did you? 
 I... 
 Oh, that's so cute and so wrong. 
 Whatevs. 
 Did you just whatevs me? 
 She totally just whatevs'd you. 
 I'm here for Daniel. 
 He's gonna win, right? 
 With me here, I'm sure he will. 
 He can feel my presence. 
 I don't know. 
 That guy Mike from the dolphins might beat him. 
 He won't. 
 How do you know? 
 Does being a witch mean you're psychotic too? 
 Psychic, Sophie. Psychic. 
 I just have to make sure Mike swims slower than Daniel and maybe make him look ridiculous while doing it. 
 Perhaps with doggie paddle. 
 You can't do that. 
 You can't tell me what to do. 
 I'm not. 
 I'm just saying that Daniel wouldn't want to cheat. 
 How do you know what he wants? 
 She's right. 
 He's all uptight about that cheating thing. 
 Remember that time you wrote the answers to the algebra test on your hands, and he made you wash them? 
 Sophie! 
 Look, I just think Daniel's an honest guy and wants to win or lose on his own. 
 But I don't date losers. 
 I thought you weren't dating anymore. 
 Now you've done it. 
 Swimmers, to your positions. 
 I'll make sure I fix this battle. 
 Make him do the doggie paddle. 
 What was that? 
 What was what? 
 Uh, the Ray of lightning that just hit Daniel? 
 You saw that? 
 Of course. 
 On your marks...
