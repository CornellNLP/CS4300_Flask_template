 This is miss information reporting live from iridium high. 
 And then he looked right at me with those gorgeous black eyes. 
 The shark had gorgeous black eyes? 
 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 
 I can't believe your dad took you shark cage diving. 
 Right? 
 Like I need a cage to protect me. 
 The last place my dad took me to was Graceland. 
 If I had to hear him say, "thank you, thank you very much" one more time, I'll... 
 Turn him into a giant sea turtle I can ride the next time I go shark diving? 
 Nice try. 
 I mean, you should come with and, you know, maybe... 
 There's Daniel. 
 [Dirt bike engine roaring] 
 That's a double-torque upright dirt bike. 
 I thought they weren't real, just a dirt bike urban legend. 
 Hello? 
 I'm still here. 
 How was visiting your Nana? 
 Um, dangerous. 
 She spent the entire week arming the t-3 with enough gear to bring down Miami. 
 Awesome! 
 Oh, I mean, bad Nana. Tst, bad. 
 Uh, your shoe laces are untied. 
 I'm not falling for that again. 
 No, they are. Hey, you've got some... 
 To master move the dust. 
 [Electric humming] 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 How was Graceland? 
 Oh, don't get her started again. 
 This school year's just started, and I am so excited to bring you all the gossip. 
 Panthers, panthers, come here. 
 So I heard you're doing some charity work. 
 Tell me more. 
 It's called habitat for source and we build affordable housing for... lizards.

 Yeah, he sent me a text last week. 
 Sounds like the magic academy is tough. 
 In biology lab, they have to bring the frog back to life. 
 That's nothing. 
 You know Mac's dad got transferred and they had to move to Texas. 
 Well, at his new school, they have to dissect the frog, barbeque it and then eat it. 
 Yew! 
 He said it was tasty. 
 Uh, hey, bud. 
 What's up with the mittens? 
 Having some issues regulating. 
 You know, sometimes snow just... just puffs right out. 
 Froze the bath water over the weekend... with me in it. 
 And mittens are the solution? 
 Got a better one? 
 How do you control... 
 She lost her powers, remember? 
 They still haven't come back yet? 
 Ah... no. 
 Bummer. 
 Not really, it's kind of nice knowing no one's gonna try to incinerate my girl. 
 Uh, I wish I could say the same. 
 I still have nightmares about that. 
 Principal over loudspeaker: Attention! 
 Principal Alonso speaking. 
 Can they hear me? 
 I don't think they can hear me. 
 Is this thing on? 
 Uh, hello? 
 Can anyone hear me? 
 Oh, no. 
 Principal over loudspeaker: Maybe that's not... wait, wait, wait, wait, it's blinking. 
 Okay, okay, it's on. 
 [Clears throat] Emma Alonso, Emma Alonso, please report to the principal's office. 
 He better not. 
 Principal over loudspeaker: Thank you, thank you very much. 
 [Laughs] 
 Yep, he did. 
 That's harsh. 
 Leave her alone. 
 It's going to be a long year. 
 [Sighs] Dude, a little help. 
 Maddie Winkie, today's your first day of school. 
 You're going to be late. 
 And you know what I always say... 
 Push the fashion and parrot out of the way. 
 No. 
 That's only for fire sales, black Fridays, and anytime your grandmother's in town. 
 Now get out of that bed, pronto! 
 I'm never going to school ever again! 
 If I don't have my powers, I don't wanna leave this bed. 
 Where are they, mom? 
 I don't know, sweetie. 
 They could have landed anywhere. 
 You'd think whatever powerless witch they landed on would have the decency to give them back. 
 Maybe she wants to, but she's... she's... 
 She lives far, far away. 
 How far could they possibly have gone? 
 Oh, very far. 
 I mean, your powers could be in... Orlando. 
 Orlando? 
 Well, let's just go there and find them. 
 Or Texas. 
 Or California. 
 Or maybe they're in equator. 
 You made that last one up, didn't you? 
 [Sighs] This is why you need to go back to school. 
 I want my powers back! 
 I don't care where they are or who has them! 
 Yeah, honey, better you don't care about who has them. 
 [Electric buzzing] 
 T-3, let's pack our bags. 
 Do we have everything we need for school this year? 
 I think so. 
 Check the list. 
 Twenty packs of chocolate pudding. 
 Both : Check. 
 Twenty feet of hosing. 
 Check. 
 Food coloring, assorted pumps and 30 rolls of duct tape. 
 Check, check and double check. 
 Good, now do we have everything for today's big project? 
 Operation chocolate Alonso? 
 Wait, why are we going after Mr. Alonso? 
 Because he hates Daniel. 
 And Daniel's our brother. 
 You mess with Daniel, you mess with the terrible three. 
 Both : Yeah. 
 Mom : Kids! 
 You're still here? 
 You were supposed to leave with Daniel. 
 Come on, I'll drive you. 
 All : Thank you, mom. 
 Just have to pack some stuff into the car. 
 All right, come on. 
 You'll love iridium high. 
 Jax, that's a unique name. 
 It's a family name. 
 Ah, so is Francisco, believe it or not. 
 [Laughs] We have tons of activities. 
 Our swim team, best in the country. 
 So I've heard. 
 I'm looking forward to that. 
 Our debate team won regionals last year. 
 Mostly due to gigi rueda. 
 You really can't shut gigi up. 
 [Laughs] No, really, you can't. 
 So, um, how are your grades, Jax? 
 [Electric buzzing] 
 Good, mostly as. 
 Good for you. 
 We need students like you here at iridium. 
 Hi, dad. 
 I mean, Mr. Alonso. 
 You asked for me? 
 There you are. 
 This is Jax novoa, a new student transfer from... 
 Sydney. 
 Emma, I'd like for you to show him around. 
 Me? 
 Sure, but don't you want someone who's been going here longer? 
 I've never even been to some places like the band room, the workout room, the basement biology lab. 
 That place is just scary. 
 I'm sure you'll do just fine. 
 Yeah, I'm sure you'll do just fine. 
 Hey, Lily, now that Emma's defended her title as the chosen one, does she get anything? 
 You know like a belt or something? 
 Andi, this is serious. 
 The witches council is upset that Emma revealed the magic realm to humans. 
 There's even some talk about... it can't be. 
 About what? 
 About the council coming out of the realm. 
 Don't smile, it's not good. 
 They almost never come out together. 
 Well, um, can they take Emma's powers? 
 They can do whatever they want. 
 But they won't come. 
 They can't come. 
 They usually wait for the chosen one to summon them. 
 You know, they're all into formalities and rules. 
 Well, you know what? 
 If they want to get to Emma, they'll have to get through me. 
 That's a thermometer. 
 Oh. 
 With Emma's dad as the new principal, I can't afford to mess up. 
 I thought you spent the whole summer trying to win him over. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Kind of. 
 You'll love my mom's roast beef. 
 It's fool proof. 
 [Explosion] 
 
 
 
 Hey, Emma, I'm sorry I'm late. 
 I thought I saw your dad in the drive... 
 I was struggling to reel it in, and it took like a half an hour, but it was like this big! 
 Oh! 
 And then the t-3 set up this orange soda sprinkler system. 
 And when Mr. Alonso went to check the mail, he got soaked with tropical tangy tangerine. 
 Oh, yeah, the soda sprinkler. 
 It's very messy, but it's very tasty. 
 You know, it doesn't matter. 
 That's in the past. 
 Nothing's gonna go wrong from now on. 
 You know, Mr. Alonso is gonna love me, even if it... 
 Even if it drenches him in tropical tangy tangerine? 
 [Sighs] 
 And this is the trophy case. 
 As you can see, the sharks won a lot of them. 
 So your dad's the principal? 
 Yep. 
 He was promoted after the last principal... 
 Um, had a bit of a meltdown. 
 Did you win any of these? 
 [Laughs] You're obviously new here, otherwise you'd know I'm way too clumsy to have won any sport's awards. 
 You don't look so clumsy to me. 
 You've only known me ten minutes. 
 Give it another five, I'm sure I'll trip and knock my lunch right on you. 
 Are you asking me out for lunch? 
 Um, no. I... sure. 
 Daniel and Andi are waiting for me, but you're free to join us. 
 Not what I had in mind, but if you insist. 
 Just let me drop my bag off in my locker. 
 Oh, right. 
 It's part of the tour. 
 Let's see... over there. 
 Okay, be right back. 
 Hexy, what are you doing here? 
 Andi brought you? 
 That's it, Andi can't babysit you anymore. 
 Now get in there before anyone sees you. 
 This is miss information bringing you the 411 on the new school year. 
 The cafeteria's bringing back pork pot pie Fridays. 
 There's a new history teacher. 
 And there's a cute new student alert going off in your phones... right now. 
 Welcome Jax novoa. 
 And the cafeteria's straight through there. 
 The food's pretty decent, but watch off for tasty taco Tuesdays. 
 They ain't tasty or tacos. 
 [Laughs] 
 That concludes our tour. 
 Thank you for choosing the Alonso touring company. 
 Any questions? 
 Yeah, just one. 
 Would you say that there's any... 
 Emma, don't be so rude. 
 Jax is new here. 
 You should introduce him. 
 How do you know my name? 
 How do you know his name? 
 You were just looking at the miss information alert with me that mentioned his name twice. 
 Oh, yeah, but how did miss information know? 
 Magic? 
 [Laughing] 
 I'm Katie, head panther. 
 And this is Sophie. 
 You'll wanna hang with us. 
 Don't worry, they might seem intimidating, but the panthers are harmless. 
 See ya later. 
 So where are you taking us to lunch? 
 Um, the cafeteria? 
 Oh, great choice. 
 [Phone beeps] 
 Uh... 
 It's Maddie. 
 She sounds really upset. 
 Who's Maddie? 
 Head panther. 
 I thought you were head panther. 
 Uh, I am, just, uh, don't tell Maddie I said so. 
 I don't know who Maddie is. 
 We should probably go. 
 We'll have lunch tomorrow. 
 It'll be tasty taco Tuesday! 
 ♪ 
 This is miss information with an exclusive interview with new student Jax novoa. 
 Hi, Jax, and welcome to miss information. 
 Question one, why did you move here? 
 Um... 
 Question two, are you single? 
 Question three, were you or were you not canoodling with Emma Alonso? 
 Ah, um... 
 So how did the tour go with the new kid? 
 How did you know about that? 
 Everybody knows. 
 Miss information posted all about it. 
 I don't know why. 
 It was boring, nothing to blog about. 
 I don't know, witnesses seem to think you two were canoodling. 
 Canoodling? 
 We weren't canoodling. 
 You just better hope Daniel didn't see this. 
 He wouldn't care, he trusts me. 
 Oh, you mean kinda like how he trusts you when you say you don't have your powers back? 
 Look, I didn't mean to lie. 
 Daniel was just so happy, and I didn't wanna change that. 
 And then it just... Spiraled out of control. 
 Yeah, well, I think I have the best solution. 
 You do? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, so first you send him a message to meet you in a nice, quiet spot. 
 And you wait for him there. 
 And then when he arrives... 
 What? When he arrives what? 
 You set off a crazy pyrotechnic firework display that spells out "they're back," and then the two of you fly to Siberia to look for the last living wolf pack on earth. 
 So you want me to live out your fantasy with Daniel and not you? 
 Oh, well obviously you guys would stop by my house and take me with you. 
 Sorry to burst your dreams, but I still think it's better if Daniel doesn't know. 
 I know it's lying, but it's for a good cause. 
 Fine, I guess you'll just have to make it up to me some other way. 
 Oh, really, how's that? 
 Mm, by convincing your new canoodling buddy to let us go for a ride on his dirt bike. 
 Wait, so was that a yes? 
 Maddie? 
 Are you okay? 
 Do I look okay? 
 Mmm, that zit on your forehead seems to be clearing up. 
 Your hair's a mess. 
 [Sniffing] And something smells like my dog Maria Conchita. 
 Maria Conchita gets coconut-scented baths twice a week. 
 We missed you at school. 
 No we didn't. 
 You said you were happy Maddie lost her powers because you could finally take your rightful place as a true leader of the panthers. 
 Uh, you did? 
 Now you remember things? 
 Why are you here? 
 We came to cheer you up. 
 This depression thing has gone on long enough. 
 We need to snap you out of it. 
 Did you bring me my powers? 
 Because that's the only thing that's gonna snap anything out of me! 
 Better. 
 We brought the emergency pink kit. 
 [Sighs] 
 Have we covered the full moon? 
 Yes, last week. 
 It's the witch's full moon. 
 It's spelled f-o-o-l and not f-u-l-l. 
 It happens every 20 years, and it can make witches go bonkers. 
 Don't dismiss a fool moon. 
 Strange things happen until the new moon rises. 
 Um, what's next? 
 Oh, have you been practicing your transformation spells? 
 I would say... yes. 
 Depending on your definition of practicing. 
 Emma! 
 I haven't been doing a lot of magic lately. 
 Daniel doesn't know I have my powers... 
 Daniel? 
 That's another thing. 
 You can't be dating him anymore. 
 What? 
 Well, the council doesn't agree with humans and witches, you know, dating. 
 Uh, they can't tell me what to do. 
 You're a witch, Emma. 
 Yes, they can. 
 Well, if they want me to stop seeing Daniel, they're gonna have to come say it to my face. 
 [Sighs] I wish you hadn't said that. 
 You know whose fault this is? 
 Ohhh, let me guess. 
 Daniel's? The principal's? 
 Katie's? 
 No, no, and it better be no. 
 This is all Emma's fault. 
 She was all "we have to beat the principal and save the world, ha-ha-ha." 
 First she stole Daniel from me. 
 And then she stole my powers. 
 And now she's gonna... now she's gonna pay, big time. 
 Done. 
 Easy as pudding. 
 Get it? 
 Pudding? 
 T-3, hold it. 
 Daniel. 
 What are you doing here? 
 We're... taking a tour for when we go here in four to eight years. 
 Really? Piping... what? 
 Why? 
 The water fountain. 
 What did you do to it? 
 We just... made some improvements. 
 He's coming. 
 Daniel : Uh, who is he? 
 Go, go, go, go. 
 No! 
 You! You again? 
 And you're ready. 
 Watch out, world, here comes Maddie. 
 Good job, panthers. 
 Just one thing. 
 Shoes. 
 I'm a van pelt who just can't lose, now change these into designer shoes. 
 It's okay, I'll grab your favorite red pumps from the closet. 
 Good idea, Katie, Maddie doesn't have her powers anymore. 
 See? 
 It's okay, she didn't mean it. 
 I want my powers back! 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Is that Maddie crying or is it the doorbell? 
 Agh! 
 Agh, Agh, Agh! 
 No, no, no! 
 Mrs. van pelt, it's just me, Diego. 
 I took Maddie to the anime dance last year, remember? 
 What are you doing here? 
 You cannot be here... cannot. 
 I heard that Maddie was sick today, so I brought her her homework and some... 
 Ugh! 
 Ice for her soda or her juice or whatever she likes. 
 Deny! 
 Oh, you remember me! 
 We have to walk home by ourselves today. 
 Daniel's in detention and my dad's waiting for Daniel's parents to get here. 
 Somehow Daniel covered my dad in pudding. 
 Does it matter what flavor it was? 
 Chocolate. 
 Is that an iridium high thing? 
 Wha... I, um, didn't see you. 
 You talk to all your books? 
 Just the science books. 
 The literature ones are all stuffy and intellectual. 
 I heard you walking home though. 
 You wanna ride? 
 Uh, no thank you. 
 I, um, live really close. 
 So close I can hear Mr. Smith get overexcited about clouds in geography class. 
 [Laughs] 
 Yep, so I gotta go. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 Have a safe walk home. 
 But you're not walking, you're driving your bike. 
 Which is a dirt bike, so... yeah, see ya. 
 Wait, Emma, you dropped your... wallet. 
 Witch's council here I come. 
 [Thunder rumbling] 
 Oh, no, I broke it. 
 All right, people, let's get this show on the road. 
 I don't got all night. 
 We'll be done soon. 
 We just have to find the chosen one.
