 Could you hurry up so we can get our freezin' on? 
 Our freezing? 
 Yeah. 
 I bring the stuff, and you freeze the stuff. 
 I just have to clean back here, but it's gonna take a long time if it's, uh... 
 Just me. 
 (Sighs) Okay, fine. 
 I'll help. 
 Thank you. 
 Come again. 
 What? 
 I think I drank too much soda. 
 (Belches) 
 Mac? 
 (Knocks) 
 Oh, no. Oh, no. 
 What did I do? 
 I still can't find it! 
 Look, could you have moved it in your sleep? 
 I don't sleepwalk, and I'm pretty sure I don't sleep move stuff. 
 I don't even think that's a real thing. 
 It is too! 
 Or so I've heard. 
 What? Wait, wait, wait. 
 I think I found it. 
 No. No, wait. Never mind. 
 It's just a huge stash of glow-in-the-dark stickers. 
 Quick! Quick! Get it off of me. 
 Easy. 
 Get it off. Get it off. 
 Eww. Eww. Calm down. 
 It's stuck. It's stuck. 
 Okay. 
 That was terrifying! (Gasping) 
 What were we doing? 
 Looking for the Hexerin. 
 Right. Right. 
 Well, it's definitely not in the closet, and there's no way I'm going back in there. 
 It had to be Maddie. 
 Watch out, world, Maddie's about to get some mad magic skills. 
 (Giggles) 
 Hey! 
 Watch the hair!

 Maddie Winkie, are you okay? 
 (Knocking at door) 
 I... 
 I was in the living room reading, and... 
 You were reading? 
 A book? 
 Yes. 
 I read. 
 Books. 
 I am in a book club, after all. 
 A fake one you invented. 
 Whatevser. (Stammers) 
 I heard noises. Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Why? 
 You just wanted to come in and spy. 
 (Gasps) 
 Be careful. That rhymed. 
 You don't want to cast spells in front of people accidentally... 
 Or on purpose. 
 Yeah, yeah, no one can know I'm a witch. 
 And you definitely don't want to cast spells on people, particularly spells that dramatically change their appearance or behavior. 
 It's just too noticeable. 
 Promise me that. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Aha! 
 I knew it. What did you do? 
 Um, I might have cast a teensy-tiny, insignificant little spell. 
 Maddie. 
 Hey there. 
 You were really quiet during dinner. 
 Are you feeling okay? 
 Is this some kind of "vow of silence" experiment? 
 Want to tell your old man about it? 
 Come on. I'm cool. 
 So what is it? 
 (Sighs) 
 You can't stop saying the opposite of what you mean? 
 You think your subconscious is playing tricks on you. 
 You insulted Emma, and you got back together with Maddie against your will? 
 Wow. 
 Look. We can figure this out. 
 Why don't you say the opposite of what you want to say, and it should come out right. 
 If I ask you, "are the terrible three always causing trouble?" 
 Yes. 
 Is it working? 
 Nn... yes. Yes! 
 You see? 
 There you go. 
 You're welcome. 
 Break that spell immediately. 
 No! 
 You can't tell me what to do. 
 I'm a witch, and you're not. 
 But I'm your mother. 
 And in this human world we live in, that means you have to do what I say. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Then what's in it for moi? 
 Fine. 
 I will buy you those silver strappy sandals you wanted. 
 That's a good jumping off point for negotiations, but I think we can aim a little high... 
 Maddie. 
 Okay, okay, I'll break the spell. 
 Then let's head straight to the mall, stat. 
 Good. 
 But remember, I'm a witch. 
 Is a witch who doesn't cast spells still a witch? 
 (Whispers) Think about it. 
 Let's face it. 
 Maddie stole the Hexerin, and now we're gonna steal it back. 
 You're right, and it's not stealing if it belonged to me in the first place. 
 Oh, I like this taking charge attitude. 
 Okay, who wants some of my famous blackened pancakes? 
 You mean burnt? 
 I mean, ooh, me! 
 (Mouths words) 
 Ursula made pancakes for our book club. 
 Oh, I love breakfast for dinner. 
 Actually, these were little tiny pancakes. 
 She called them bilinis. 
 And then she, like, spread caviar around them and served it with a champagne. 
 Eww! 
 Way to ruin breakfast for dinner. 
 No, it was delicious. 
 I had no idea Ursula was such a good cook. 
 Wouldn't it be great if you and Maddie became stepsisters? 
 (Coughing) 
 Emma, you okay? Here. 
 Here's some juice. 
 Could you imagine that? 
 Why sunflower seeds? 
 Because, they're the kind of annoying thing Maddie would totally eat and make me clean up after her. 
 I like how detailed your fantasy world is. 
 Maddie cannot become my stepsister, and she cannot have the Hexerin. 
 We've got to talk to nurse Lily. 
 So she can teach you a spell to make your dad hate Maddie's mom? 
 No, so she can help us get the Hexerin back. 
 But now that you mention it... 
 Hold still! 
 We're trying. 
 It's got a mind of its own. 
 And it obviously doesn't want you to read it. 
 Too bad! 
 Maybe you could apologize to it. 
 I'm not apologizing to a book. 
 (Hexerin slams shut) 
 See? 
 It's okay. 
 I managed to write down a couple spells that we can try out. 
 Now that I have the Helga-tron-a-Rex... 
 Thing, I've got all the power. 
 (Laughs maniacally) 
 Panthers, school. 
 Iridium high is about to meet the new and improved magic Maddie. 
 Hmm! 
 (Giggles) (Giggles) 
 (Both giggle) 
 You're the only one that I could trust to help me and keep this a secret. 
 How did this happen? 
 I don't know. 
 But I seem to be some sort of, like, dragon or something but that breathes ice, not fire. 
 (Sighs) A kanay. 
 What? A kana-what? 
 Uh, nothing. 
 Um... 
 Have you ever breathed fire? 
 No. 
 But I have made fire in my fingers. 
 Okay. 
 Give me your hands. 
 Give me your hands. 
 Uh... 
 Now, concentrate. 
 What? 
 Concentrate. 
 (Zapping) 
 (Gasps) 
 Oh, Mac! 
 Mac! 
 You're okay! 
 D-don't... 
 Ever burp on me again. 
 (Both sigh) 
 Good. 
 He's alive. 
 Here. 
 Dry yourself. 
 Diego. 
 You've got to be more careful. 
 You can't go around using your powers until you know how to control them. 
 But how do I learn how to control my powers if I don't use them? 
 You don't. 
 And you don't let anybody know you have them. 
 We have to get the Hexerin back asap. 
 How? Is there a spell I can cast? 
 No, spells don't work on the Hexerin. 
 Ironically, you'll just have to do it the old-fashioned way. 
 You steal it back. 
 Oh! Right. 
 I wasn't sure if "old-fashioned" meant the same to you as it does to me since you're so much older. 
 I mean, not that much older, just, like, another generation older. 
 So our references might not be the same and... 
 I'll shut up now so you can tell me how to steal the Hexerin back. 
 Andi, Andi, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! 
 Do you know where Emma is? I need to apologize to her. 
 No. 
 And don't use those puppy eyes. 
 They don't work on me. 
 Please? 
 (Scoffs) They don't... 
 Work... 
 All right. She's... 
 Get lost, tool girl. 
 Tools are cool. 
 So that's not an insult. 
 I'm having a private conversation with my boyfriend. 
 Capisce? 
 Good. Wait. Your boyfriend? 
 You guys got back together? 
 Yep, spread the word... 
 To everyone. 
 Hurry up! 
 We have to get home and figure out how to steal back the you-know-what. 
 Why are you so anxious? 
 Look, something was different about Maddie today. 
 She seemed more... 
 Powerful. 
 And Daniel? 
 Was he still being all not Daniel-ish? 
 Can we not worry about Daniel right now? 
 (Clattering) 
 Or ever. 
 
 
 
 Oh, hey, guys. 
 Don't "hey, guys" us like we're your friends. 
 We were just leaving. (Laughs nervously) 
 Not yet. 
 I want to show you what I just learned. 
 Sophie, out. 
 But I want to see. 
 They've got chocolate-covered asparagus in the cafeteria today. 
 Ooh! 
 So what was it that you wanted to show us? 
 Just a little trick I learned. 
 Trick? 
 You do magic too? 
 Before Emma bores me so much I frown, turn this classroom upside down. 
 Hold on! 
 (All screaming) 
 Ow! 
 Ow! 
 (All moaning) 
 (Gasps) 
 What did you do? 
 I taught them not to mess with me. 
 Now, let's go home and find out what else this better, meaner Maddie can do. 
 Hmm. (Giggles) 
 How are we gonna get down from here? 
 I never thought I'd say this, but this is beyond my magic expertise. 
 You think? 
 The blood's rushing to my head. 
 Your brain can... 
 Your brain can explode when that... 
 Help! Somebody out there help me! 
 Help, we need you! Shh! 
 (Muffled yelling) 
 Remind me never to pick you to be on my team during the zombie apocalypse. 
 Listen, we'll explain everything later if you promise to calm down. 
 This is a zombie apocalypse? 
 Hey, it was a hypothetical! 
 Tony, I know this is totally bizarre and freaky, but once we get down, I'll explain everything. 
 Hey, I'm getting kind of used to this maybe. 
 This is kind of cool. 
 It's like I'm in some, like, awesome music video. 
 You mean you know how this happened? 
 Yes, and I think I know how to fix this. 
 I need to cast a... 
 The classroom's about to flip again! 
 Hey, guys, the weirdest thing happened to me. 
 (Laughs) 
 Nothing compared to what happened to me. 
 To you? You mean what happened to me. 
 (Phone beeps) Want to bet? 
 Definitely. Double or nothing. 
 You can't go double or nothing when you haven't even bet once. 
 Well, that's how confident I am. 
 I wouldn't be so sure about this, Diego. 
 Oh, come on! 
 What could possibly be weirder than me freezing you into a giant block of ice? 
 This. 
 According to miss information,   Daniel got back with Maddie. 
 You got back together with Maddie? 
 You froze him into a giant block of ice? 
 (Groans) Too close to call. 
 I think it stopped. 
 No, no, don't let go. 
 Come on. What are you waiting for? 
 Cast a spell, and fix this. 
 Spell? What do you mean a spell? 
 I'm afraid to make it worse. 
 You know the whole monkey/rabbit/turtle/monkey thing. 
 What are you two talking about? 
 If and when we get out of here, Maddie is so going to get it. 
 Maddie? 
 What does Maddie have to do with this? 
 I'll explain everything later. 
 Right now, we have to try to crawl to the door. 
 Maddie's spell said classroom, so I'm figuring the rest of the school is not upside down. 
 Did Daniel call? 
 No, but you did get an alert that you're 900 texts over your monthly text allowance. 
 That's all? 
 Maddie, at the risk of you throwing something at my head, I need to tell you. 
 You cannot leave the classroom upside down. 
 Your mother clearly said... 
 "Maddie Winky, "you can't let anybody know about your powers. 
 Keeping magic secret is Paramount to our survival." 
 Okay, fine. 
 I've had my fun with that anyway. 
 It's time to try something new. 
 He must be a descendent of the last kanay family. 
 Wow, so you've never seen one before? 
 No, I wonder what kind of frog a kanay would make. 
 Are you sure you've bewitched all those frog's parents so they're not wondering where their kids are? 
 Oh, of course. 
 I have a spreadsheet that I use to keep track. 
 So what now? 
 Well, we can't have a kanay running around during the eclipse. 
 They're so unpredictable with their honor and loyalty. 
 Bring him to me after school tomorrow. 
 You are not gonna hurt him, are you? 
 Of course not. 
 We'll just have a nice chat, and, well, if he gets difficult, there's always room for one more amphibian in my little aquarium. 
 Oh, no! Here we go again. 
 When is it gonna stop shaking and actually... 
 You had to say that, didn't you? 
 Well, it worked, didn't it? 
 (Grunting) 
 Emma, Emma, are you okay? 
 I'm fine, thanks. 
 Yeah, I'm good too. 
 Thanks for asking. 
 Okay, I can figure out exactly what happened. 
 The upcoming full moon and eclipse caused a super strong gravitational pull that flipped us upside down. 
 Look at that, Tony trying to use logic to figure this one out. 
 So sad. 
 Done. Happy? 
 I'm just watching out for you, Maddie. 
 I don't need watching out for. 
 But your mom said "Maddie Winky, "you can't let anybody know about your powers. 
 Keep your magic a sec"... 
 Oh, enough with that! 
 She's not even a witch. 
 I am a witch. 
 Yes, you are. 
 There's no way Tony's keeping this a secret. 
 Sure he will. 
 I've got to send this story over to miss information. 
 My coolness factor will increase tenfold. 
 Both : No! 
 What? 
 You can't tell anyone about this. 
 Why? 
 Because... Because... 
 Okay, someone needs to tell me what's going on. 
 I'm tired of all the lying. 
 Let's just tell him. 
 Casting spells, so you're talking about witches? 
 Yes. 
 I'm a witch. 
 (Speaking gibberish) 
 Andi, stop it! You're not a witch. 
 She's not a witch. 
 I know that. Duh. 
 There's no such thing as witches. 
 Actually, yes there are. 
 And I'm one of them. 
 Hey, Daniel, I didn't see you there. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You've become a real witch, Maddie. 
 He knows? 
 I think he means figuratively. 
 (Gasps) 
 How dare he call her a figuratively? 
 You've changed, and we need to talk about you and me. 
 Um, that'll have to wait. 
 We have to get Sophie home asap. 
 She had an allergic reaction to something she ate at lunch. 
 Oh, woe is me! 
 Something seems to be disagreeing with my system. 
 Save my life! Take me home! 
 (Gasping) 
 We'll talk later, I promise. 
 (Whimpering) 
 You what? 
 I had no choice! 
 No, she really didn't. 
 He saw everything. 
 Everything. 
 And it's the second time he's seen a spell. 
 Second time. 
 Andi! 
 Sorry, I was just trying to be your hype man. 
 Thought it might help your cause. 
 Second time he's seen a spell? 
 I broke his vase at the magic show, and I had to fix it, but I pretended it was just a magic trick. 
 Well, with Tony, there's only one thing to do now. 
 What's that? 
 You're just gonna have to wipe his memory. 
 What? 
 Cool! 
 No, not cool. 
 Right, right. Not cool. 
 (Whispers) So cool. 
 It's a tricky spell, and without the Hexerin it's even more difficult. 
 It's possible he could forget everything. 
 What? 
 No, I'm sorry, Lily, but I can't do that... 
 Not to my friends, not to anyone. 
 I'm sure if I just talk to Tony, he'll keep the secret. 
 You know, I'm so happy you're so nice as a person, but sometimes you're a little too nice as a witch. 
 Mom, what are you doing in my room? 
 Going through your stuff. 
 What? Why? 
 No reason, except for... 
 This! 
 (Clunk) Ow! 
 (Gasps) 
 What are you doing? 
 You wouldn't answer my calls, and your dad keeps closing the door on me, so I... 
 You decided to go all stalker on me and climb through my window? 
 Please, just hear me out. 
 I don't know what came over me this week. 
 It's like I was possessed or something. 
 Okay, go on. 
 But I wanted to tell you that... I like you. 
 You do? 
 Yes. 
 You're quirky, you're a little bit cheesy, and you definitely talk a lot. 
 Gee, thanks. 
 No, no, I meant that as a compliment, but lately I can't say anything right. 
 Like yesterday, I kept saying the opposite of what I meant. 
 Oh. 
 Oh! 
 It's like I was under a spell or something. 
 What? No, definitely not mine. 
 I mean, I can't cast spells. 
 That's totally preposterous. 
 See what I mean? 
 You're funny, you're strange, and you're unpredictable, and now that I think I can say what I mean, I wanted to tell you that I think about you all the time, and I want to go out with you. 
 Danny, me too. 
 Really, but if we're going to go out, I have to tell you the truth.
