 [engine shuts off] 
 Hey, pal, how are you? 
 We'd like a quick word, if you don't mind. 
 What... what's this all about? 
 You want to tell us who you were visiting in there? 
 Nobody. I was just, uh... I don't know... 
 Okay, look. 
 Here is how this is going to go... you are either going to cooperate with us, or you're gonna get locked up. 
 Whoa, whoa. Okay, Officers, look, I-I got a wife, I-I got a family. 
 I can't be caught up in this kind of... 
 You got a wife? 
 All right, then do exactly what we tell you to do. 
 Yeah, of course. You got it, guys. I'll... I'll do anything you need. 
 I just... I-I can't have anybody find out about this. 
 I mean, you're sympathetic, I'm sure. 
 [laughs] Sympathetic? 
 Yeah. Yeah, sure. We're plenty sympathetic, aren't we, Bull? 
 Yeah, we're a couple of bleeding hearts. 
 All right, so, here's what you're gonna do... you're gonna go back, you're gonna knock on the door and say you left your keys somewhere inside, okay? 
 And... and then... and then what? 
 Just do it. 
 [sighs] 
 Fortune : Hello?! 
 Hey, sweetheart, it's me. 
 I-I think I must have left my keys somewhere in the apartment. 
 Come on in. The door's open. 
 All right, Miss, bad news... 
 Guess who's under arrest. 
 What? A-are you kidding me? 
 Billy is just a friend. 
 I-is there a law against having a friend come over? 
 Please, let's not make this more difficult than it needs to be, okay, sweetheart? 
 But I haven't done anything wrong. He's just a friend. 
 I got kids, Fortune. I can't get caught up in this. 
 He... he's lying. 
 Don't blame him. We've gotten a number of complaints from your neighbors. 
 Why don't you go get dressed, we'll take you down to the station house, and get this over with? 
 Please. I-I can't be arrested. 
 This isn't something I do all the time. 
 It's just once in a while. 
 Oh, I don't doubt it. 
 You're probably just a regular, sweet kid, right? 
 New to fun city, had to turn a couple tricks to make ends meet. Am I right? 
 Yes, that's exactly what happened. 
 [laughs] 
 Charlie, please take her to the bedroom, have her get dressed. 
 Come on. 
 So, what do you want? 
 If I give you a blow job, can we forget about this? 
 Sorry, Miss. It doesn't work like that, okay? 
 Please, just get dressed. 
 I'll do whatever you want. 
 You can come over any time for a freebie. 
 You or your partner. 
 You guys want to party, I can be your girl. 
 Just please don't arrest me. 
 I'm sorry, Miss. Just please... just get dressed, and then maybe we can talk. 
 You must be married, huh? 
 That's none of your business. 
 I heard most cops would work out a deal if you got busted. 
 Well, most cops would. 
 So, why won't you? 
 'Cause, like my partner said, we've been getting a lot of complaints from your neighbors, and our boss wants an arrest. 
 So, I'm going to jail? 
 Yeah, that's how it works. 
 Do you mind? 
 What, you can't do this yourself? 
 [chuckles] No. 
 That good? 
 Yes. Thanks. 
 So, y-you never been locked up before? 
 No. 
 Who do you work for? 
 Nobody. I work alone. 
 What, you don't have a madame or a pimp? 
 No. Like I said, I just do this part-time. 
 Every hooker we arrest gives us the same line of sh1t. 
 [voice breaking] But I'm telling you the truth! 
 All right, sure you are. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 Y-you want proof? Here. 
 That's my union card. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 You're a schoolteacher? 
 Hey, Petey, I want you to take a ride with me. 
 We're gonna meet my buddy Duffy for a cup of coffee. 
 Duffy? I thought that skell was still in the can. 
 Yeah, well, he's out, and we're just gonna talk to him. 
 I didn't make him any promises. 
 You promised him a meeting. 
 Muldoon : All right, thank you. 
 [receiver hangs up] 
 The... the local guy in the precinct's never heard of her. 
 He did a name check and nothing came up. 
 She ain't never been collared before. 
 I mean, this kid might really be a schoolteacher. 
 Take a look around this apartment. 
 You really think a schoolteacher lives here? 
 Well, she showed me her union card. 
 We still need an arrest. 
 All right, well, let's just grab her on loitering, say we picked her up outside the building. 
 That way, it covers the complaint from the Lieutenant. 
 Yeah, and that way your sob story doesn't need to go to the tombs, either. 
 You know, you're too soft for this job, you big kraut. 
 All right, Romeo, you're coming with me. 
 All right, she's your responsibility now. 
 Officer, I beg of you, I... it... I would do anything if we could just forget about this, anything at all. 
 Then what were you thinking going with a hooker in the first place, dopey? 
 I'm in from out of town. I just... 
 I had a little too much booze at lunch. 
 I just got carried away. 
 And you know what? 
 Sometimes you have to take responsibility for our actions. 
 Officer, please. Listen to me. I'm a good man. 
 Back in Minnesota, I'm the president of the father's club. 
 My... my wife, she's on the school board. 
 How would this look if my kids... if my kids found out about this? 
 Yeah, and what would happen if I got jammed up for letting you go? 
 How's that gonna look to my wife and kids? 
 Minnesota isn't the only place where appearances count. 
 Look, I-I have over $300 in my wallet, and I can get more from the bank. 
 Okay, look, that sh1t might work in your hometown, but you're in New York City now. 
 We got different rules here. 
 Come on. Let's take the stairs. 
 Look, I-I-I wouldn't have to... 
 I wouldn't have to tell anyone. 
 Please, please, you have to let me go. 
 Okay, first of all, I do not have to do anything, all right? 
 But let me see your wallet. 
 All right, Mr. Ford. 
 Because I am a sympathetic man, here's the deal... 
 I'm gonna take $200 with the understanding you take the remainder and get your ass on a flight back to Michigan tonight. 
 Minnesota. 
 Quiet honestly, I don't give a sh1t where you go. 
 But hopefully you've learned your lesson not to screw around with whores in New York. 
 Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much. 
 I really appreciate this. Thank you. 
 Just get the hell out of here. 
 A little donation from Minnesota's father of the year. 
 Guess who's back in town. 
 O'bannon : Ah, Paddy D. 
 Come on. Scooch, scooch, scooch, scooch. 
 Good to see you, man. 
 Yeah. You remember Petey Mac? 
 Yeah, 'course, 'course, 'course. 
 Man, it's good to see you. Beantown. 
 Listen, before we talk shop, I wanted to tell you, Big Red is throwing me a little welcome-home party tomorrow night at the Old Town. 
 There's gonna be a ton of broads there, so you got to come. 
 Yeah, and my old man, no doubt. 
 Yeah. I heard you gave him a beating. What... what happened there? 
 Nothing, other than the fact that he's a piece of sh1t, but you already knew that. 
 Yeah. 
 So, what else is going on? You said you had something you want to talk about. 
 Yeah, what do you think is going on? I'm looking to get back to work. 
 I'm looking to set up a new game, and I wanted to take care of business so we don't have any trouble. 
 Already? Duff, you're not even out 48 hours. 
 Yeah. A man's got to make a living. 
 Make a living? 
 Yeah. My old crap game made me a nice living. 
 Talk to Patton about this? 
 Yeah. That was my first order of business. My second is, I was seeing if my nearest and dearest would still be willing to help me out. 
 Depends on what you're asking. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What I'm asking? 
 I'm asking for protection for the game. 
 It's the least he can do for his oldest friend. 
 I don't care how far back you go, business is business. 
 Okay. 
 Duff, what are you thinking? 
 Tuesday nights over at my girl's place, 68th Street. 
 Oh, uptown! 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. How'd you meet this broad? 
 Eh, it's just some chick I know. 
 Yeah? And you trust her enough already to have the game at her place? 
 She's a good girl. I got to know her in the joint. 
 How'd you manage that? 
 She wrote me letters. 
 Ah. I didn't know you could read. 
 That's funny. That's funny. 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 Hey, listen to me. Listen good. 
 I'm gonna see what we can do on our part, but I'm telling you, if you're lying about this Big Red stuff, he's gonna see to it that you're floating in the river. 
 [scoffs] Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. 
 [engine shuts off] 
 Woman : Are you kidding me? 
 Woman #2 : Hi, handsome. 
 Officer : Let's go. Move your ass. 
 [laughs] 
 Officer Shea, reporting for Plainclothes. 
 Third floor, superstar. 
 [telephone ringing] 
 [police radio chatter] 
 Johanson : You must be Shea. Come on in. 
 I'll talk to you soon. 
 Have a seat, son. 
 You look like a goddamn altar boy. 
 Your C.O. up in the 15th says you're a good cop. 
 Is that true? Are you a good cop? 
 Or are you some kind of mutt that I got to worry about? 
 No, sir. You don't have to worry about me. 
 I hope not, 'cause this is a choice assignment. 
 I hope you're aware of that. 
 Uh, yes, I am. My father filled me in. 
 Good man, your father. 
 I saw him last week at the Holy Name Communion Breakfast. 
 He said you just had a baby. 
 Uh, yes, sir, a baby boy, James Jr. 
 Ah, good for you. 
 It's important for a young cop to have a family, especially in this city. 
 Otherwise, it's too easy to become a jerk-off. 
 [chuckles] 
 And I don't need a jerk-off in this office. 
 Lieutenant. 
 It's your new man, Shea. 
 You got it, Captain. 
 Be smart out there, son, but not too smart. 
 Take a seat. 
 Close the door. 
 "The laws governing the mores of the people are known as the laws relating to public morals. These are restrictive laws designed to control the actions of the people of the city to establish a peaceful and harmonious order of social living." 
 Now, what that means is, it's our job to curb all kinds of vice. 
 That includes prostitution, pornography, degeneracy, and the blue laws. 
 You got that, my man? 
 Shea : Yes, sir. 
 Good. It also includes any games of chance. 
 That's betting on sporting events, poker, Blackjack, four-card Monte, dice, birdcage, banker/broker, chuck-a-luck, roulette... any of the similar games. 
 You still with me, youngblood? 
 Yes, sir. 
 You now work for Plainclothes. 
 We work everything from 86th Street down to the Battery, river to river. 
 That's the heart of this big town, my man. 
 Can you understand that? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Are you sure about that? 'Cause you don't look so sure. 
 No, sir, I got it. 
 You're gonna partner with Vince Latucci. 
 He thinks he's hot sh1t, but he's a good cop. 
 And he killed more Japs in the Pacific than we got WOPs on Pleasant Avenue, so don't piss him off. 
 Anything else you need to know, he will explain it to you. 
 Or maybe he won't, depending on his mood. 
 King : You waiting for an invitation? 
 No, sir. 
 Then step lively, young man. 
 [clears throat] 
 Latucci, come meet your new partner. 
 Latucci : Right here, Lieu. 
 Know how to drive? 
 Yes, sir. 
 King : Hey. 
 Go give 'em hell, baby. 
 Bullman : Hey, Tooch. 
 Hey, Bull. 
 Wow! That is a gorgeous-looking girl. 
 I'll let you know when I want your opinion. 
 Until then, keep your goddamn mouth shut. 
 Hey, Terry. 
 What, you need me to hold your hand? The car's right there. 
 Stupid kid. 
 Uh, your wife called, said something happened at the school. 
 You should call her right away, all right? 
 [engine turns over] 
 You better not scratch the goddamn thing. 
 [telephone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Hey, Chris, it's me. What's go... what's going on? 
 It's James. The school called. 
 He's in trouble again. 
 Geez. What'd the comedian do this time? 
 I'm sure it's nothing. 
 That nun you love so much just has it in for him. 
 Why don't you just tell me exactly what Sister Paul said? 
 Oh, she wouldn't tell me. 
 She insisted she needed to speak to Mr. Muldoon directly regarding this very important matter. 
 She wants you there right after dismissal. 
 Uh, a-are you serious? I'm at work. 
 You don't think you can deal with this? 
 No. I've got to pick up Kate, take her to dance, then do the food shopping... 
 Okay, okay, okay. I got it, I got it. 
 I will take care of it. 
 I'm giving you a summons for loitering. 
 It's like a traffic ticket. 
 You're not gonna get photographed or printed, but you got to see the judge in a couple of weeks, all right? 
 And I'm not going to jail? 
 You're not gonna go to jail. 
 Just pay the ticket. 
 [chuckles] Thank you. 
 All right. 
 Full name? 
 Stacy Potter. 
 Stacy Potter. 
 [keys clacking] 
 Address is? 
 45 West Fifty... 
 ...First Street. 
 Occupation? 
 Schoolteacher. 
 Stacy Potter the schoolteacher. 
 Your kids are beautiful. 
 Take after their mother. 
 That's all? 
 That's all. 
 You're free to go. 
 You've been so sweet and understanding to me. 
 Um, do you think I could buy you a drink sometime to say thank you? 
 Just a drink. 
 [clears throat] 
 Please follow me. 
 [groans] 
 Look, don't ever call here, but just take this number, and if you ever need anything, just ask for Charlie Bullman. 
 For anything. 
 James : All right, I'm going to the schoolyard. 
 Yeah, but [sighs] why can't I come with you guys, too? 
 You're not coming with us. Go hang out with your own friends. 
 Well, then I'm gonna tell Daddy about what happened at school today... 
 [screams] Hey, hey! 
 You better not say anything to him about that, you little sh1t! 
 And you better get your goddamn hands off him unless you're looking for a trip to the hospital! 
 You, stay here, do your homework. 
 You... you're coming with me. 
 Move it. 
 [knock on door] 
 Sister Paul. 
 Sister paul : Please come in, Mr. Muldoon. 
 Thank you for coming in on such short notice. 
 Sit. 
 Please take a seat. 
 We have a lot to discuss. 
 You know, your son here has become quite the comedian. 
 Sit up. 
 Apparently, he can do these funny, little voices. 
 He has the whole class laughing. 
 Why don't you... why don't you do one for your father? 
 Do... do the one you did of me. 
 I'm sure he'd love to see it. 
 You hungry, kid? 
 Why? Are you hungry? 
 Never answer a question with another question, stupid. 
 I-I don't know. I grabbed something before I came in, but, I mean, if you are, then I-I guess I am. 
 Are you some kind of shithead? 
 What? No! 
 Because we don't let just any shithead into this unit. 
 We asked around about you. 
 The other guys called your old partners, spoke to other cops you've worked with, and everybody said you were a smart kid and a good cop. 
 And your old man is a boss. 
 I am sure he did not become a boss by being some kind of shithead, did he? 
 No, probably not. 
 So, let me ask you again... are you hungry? 
 Yeah, I'm hungry. 
 Excellent, Officer Shea. Let's go grab a bite to eat at John's. 
 Park over here on the left. 
 Ooh, I know John's. Isn't that on 12th? 
 Let me drive around the corner. I'll find... find a spot over there. 
 Stop the goddamn car! 
 [tires screech] 
 [horn honking] 
 Kid, if this is how we start out, you are not gonna last with me. 
 When I tell you to do something, you don't question it, you do it! 
 Now pull over the goddamn car! 
 Now, I am well-aware that John's is on 12th. 
 The reason I want you to park over here is that I don't need the whole freaking neighborhood knowing my business. 
 Capisce? 
 Yeah, I guess so. 
 [nasally voice] You guess so? [normal voice] Okay. 
 Because of your inability to answer a question with a simple "yes" or "no" answer, you don't get to eat today. 
 You're gonna sit in the car while I go eat. 
 Douchebag. 
 [engine shuts off] 
 [sighs] 
 I want you to know I'm... I'm proud of you. 
 You know, when you were born, my hope, my dream was that you, my oldest son, would grow up to be an asshole. 
 And you've done that, and it makes me proud. 
 You know, you can't imagine the joy I felt sitting in that classroom, listening to Sister Paul and hearing all the stories about what a fool you are. 
 You are the school fool. You are the class ass. 
 You are the moron whose job it is to interrupt the teacher and the class with your asinine jokes and comments. 
 And that just... it... it just makes me so proud. 
 You know, I was hoping that I was... 
 I was doing a good job raising a-a complete imbecile, and... and you've shown me that my hard work has paid off. 
 So... just want to thank you for that. 
 Now stop your crying and get your goddamn ass out of this car so I can get back to work. 
 Good morning, all-stars. 
 Michael : Good morning, Dad. 
 Kate : Good morning, Dad. 
 I said good morning. 
 Good morning. 
 Don't start with him, Terrence. He feels bad enough already. 
 Don't you, Jimmy? 
 Does he? Does he? 
 How do you think I felt having to sit in that classroom and hear about the class ass and all of his antics? 
 Enough! 
 How about one of your jokes, funnyman, huh? 
 How about one of your hysterical one-liners that gets the class all riled up? 
 All right. He gets it. 
 Does he? Does he? 
 What, all... all of a sudden, you're too shy? 
 Apparently, our boy does these really funny impressions. 
 Leave him alone. 
 He does a great John Wayne, Dad. 
 You mind your own business. 
 Does he? 
 Well, I hope it serves you well, young man, because from this day forward, you and I are done until you earn back my respect. 
 You two, have a good day at school, listen to the nuns. 
 I will speak to you later, okay? 
 Mnh-mnh. Don't run out of here so fast. 
 I want to talk to you. 
 What? You think I'm being too tough on him, right? 
 Yes. He's going through a hard time. 
 All of his friends have moved out of the neighborhood except for Conner and the Gilroy boys. 
 Oh, please, do not start with that right now. 
 We can't afford to make a move right now. 
 First of all, that's nonsense and you know it, but I'm not talking about that. Try a softer touch with him. 
 Chris, he needs to learn to take responsibility for his actions because those actions are gonna be what defines him. 
 He's not that bad a kid. 
 He didn't hold up a liquor store. 
 Not yet, but he might be headed in that direction. 
 He's at a critical moment in his life. He's going to high school soon, and it's gonna be harder and harder for me to get through to him. 
 And you think you're getting through to him like this? 
 The line between the good guys and the bad guys is very thin. 
 [scoffs] 
 And the decisions about what kind of man he's going to be are made at this age. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 I think you're overreacting, Terrence. 
 Am I? Look at your brothers. 
 Leave them out of this. You can't compare it. 
 Well, weren't they about his age when they started running numbers for Mr. Dolan? 
 That was different. We didn't have a father around. 
 Yeah, but James does. 
 So, please let me do my job.

 Hey, Mr. O'Bannon, how's it going? 
 I wanted to talk to you. 
 Listen, I don't know if anybody told you, but I'm back in business, and I even got your boy Seany helping me out with things on his end. 
 What do you say we just let bygones be bygones? 
 ♪ Well, come on ♪ 
 Muldoon : All right. So, what's this favor you got? 
 Mckenna : Talk to him, Seany. 
 You remember my friend Pat Duffy... 
 You know, the guy that was hooked up in Patton's crew? 
 Yeah, yeah. You went to school with him. 
 And if I remember correctly, he was a jerk-off, just like his father was a jerk-off. 
 No, he just screwed up. That's all. 
 Screwed up? 
 You don't think that was a little bit more than a screw-up? 
 He nearly killed that guy, Seany. 
 The guy welshed on him. What else was he supposed to do? 
 He could have been a hell of a lot smarter about it. 
 No, no, no, no. Petey, that would be impossible, given that our man Duffy has always been as dumb as a stump. 
 I know. But he did his time, and now he's back, and he wants to set up a game again. 
 Are you under the impression that we're running a social service here? 
 Terry, what am I supposed to do? 
 He's my oldest friend in the entire world. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I got to help him out. 
 Now, is this serious money, or is it nickel-and-dime bullshit? 
 No, the old game was pretty serious. 
 On the West Side? 
 Yeah, yeah, of course. 
 And when does he want to do it? 
 Just one night a week... Tuesday nights. 
 Has he taken it to Patton, or is he looking to be a cowboy? 
 He says he's good with Big Red. 
 And you believe this? 
 Yeah, yeah. He wouldn't lie to me about something like that. 
 No, he wouldn't lie. 
 [sighs] 
 All right. 
 This is your deal, though, okay? 
 We'll just add it to Patton's nut. 
 Start it at $500, we'll see if it's a real game, but you let him know we want the money up front. 
 If he cannot pay, he cannot play. 
 You understand that, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Make sure he understands that. 
 I will. 
 Hey, Bull, um, you got a phone call. 
 Hello? 
 Yeah? 
 What? 
 No. Hey, listen to me. 
 Listen, go back to your apartment right now. 
 I'll meet you there. Right now. 
 Holy sh1t! W-w-what happened to your face?! 
 Who did that to you?! 
 Who do you think? 
 What's his name?! 
 I don't know. He got my number from a friend. He's from out of town. 
 Stacy, listen to me, you don't have to protect this guy. 
 What's his name, okay? 'Cause I'm gonna go give him a talking to. 
 He's never gonna bother you again. What's his name? 
 He said his name is Mr. Smith. 
 I met him at the Randolph on Lex and 44th. 
 Mr. Smith? Oh, it's a bullshit name. 
 Well, what room's he in? 
 305. 
 And what does he look like? 
 He's big... bigger than you. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 He had this greasy, curly, brown hair. 
 He said he's in town for the jewelry convention. 
 Jesus. I'm sorry. Let... let me see your face. 
 Ah, y-your mouth is all busted up. 
 Look, y-you got to go to the Emergency Room. 
 No. I-I don't want to go to the hospital. 
 All right, well, then, let me call this guy we use. 
 He'll come down here and stitch your lip. 
 [voice breaking] And... and he threw me to the ground, and he kicked me. 
 He kicked you? 
 All right, I'm gonna call my guy, Dr. Baker. 
 He's gonna come down here and fix you up, all right? 
 And I'll be back after I go deal with this prick, okay? 
 But if you arrest him, won't I have to press charges? 
 No. Don't worry about that, all right? 
 I'm just... I'm gonna go talk to him. 
 Cap, I recognize this new man is a contract from an old friend. 
 Who happens to be an inspector. 
 I understand that, but there's something about this kid. 
 I didn't trust or like the punk the minute he walked into my office. 
 What about you, Vince, huh? 
 You've been out with him. You got a read on him? 
 He's not our kind of guy. 
 Meaning what? 
 He's everything that's wrong with too many of these young cops nowadays. 
 I mean, the kid went to college, for Christ's sakes. 
 He lives in the suburbs. 
 Jokes aside, gentlemen, is this the kind of guy we can trust? 
 To be honest, I can't tell if this kid is a complete stunad or if he's trying to play me. 
 But what I do know is that he thinks he knows everything and he don't know dick, and that concerns me. 
 As well it should. 
 So until we dig a little deeper on him, don't take him anywhere we can be embarrassed. 
 My suggestion is this, Cap... we give it seven days to see if the kid is worth keeping, if that works for you and the Boss. 
 We don't need this smartass causing us any headaches. 
 Muldoon, why don't you have a little talk with him? 
 Get a feel for this college prick. 
 [sighs] See if he has any clue what this job's about. 
 I'll leave it to you three to make the call. 
 And don't worry about my contract with the old man. 
 We gave him a shot, if it doesn't work out, then as my dear, old grandmother Octavia used to say, "Tough sh1t." 
 Muldoon : How you doing, kid? 
 Vince just gave me some cagey mug shots to look through. 
 Oh, yeah? Most of those guys were in Latucci's wedding party. 
 [chuckles] 
 Let me ask you, Shea... why did you want to get into Plainclothes? 
 My father thought it'd be a good idea. 
 He says it's the fast track to make detective. 
 Yeah, well, it certainly helps. 
 And you know what we do here? 
 Yeah. The... the colored Lieutenant gave me the talk. 
 Okay. 
 Why don't we call him Lieutenant King, all right? 
 Y-yes, sir. Lieutenant King. 
 Your old man tell you anything else? 
 He said I was gonna have a lot of fun. 
 [chuckles] 
 Well, he was not bullshitting you there. 
 And the reason is, the people of our good city like to have a lot of fun. 
 s*x, drinking, gambling... you name it, they want it. 
 However, as you well know, a lot of that sh1t's illegal. 
 After-hours joints, prostitution, gay bars, crap games, numbers... every one of them is against the law. 
 Which has never really made much sense to me, given that these are all victimless crimes. Wouldn't you agree? 
 Yeah, I guess. 
 Yeah, I mean, who's getting hurt, right? 
 Nobody. 
 Besides, do you want to lock up a couple of old-timers for having a drink on a Sunday morning or the hardworking guy who wants to place a wager on a ballgame or some poor broad who ends up hooking because life has dealt her a shitty deck? 
 What about the queers? You want to collar these poor bastards because they want to get together, have a few beers, and play a little grab-ass? 
 I know  I  don't want to. [chuckles] 
 I'm guessing you don't want to, either, because it's my understanding you're a college kid and therefore must be pretty bright. 
 So, then, what exactly do we do here? 
 Well, as I'm sure your father must have explained to you, we do what has been done for the last hundred years... we manage it for the city. 
 Think of us as the landlords. 
 And if you want to be in business... 
 [taps desk] ...you got to pay your rent. 
 Do you understand what I am telling you? 
 Yes, I do. 
 Good. 
 Now, I am only going to ask you this this one time. 
 Are you in? 
 Yes, sir. 
 [taps desk] 
 [horn honking] 
 [whistling] 
 [siren wailing] 
 Smith : Who is it? 
 Hi. It's maintenance. 
 You seem to have a leak coming from your bathroom. 
 I don't see how that's possible. Everything seems fine here. 
 Yeah, it's coming from the pipes in the walls. 
 It will just take a second, sir. 
 Sorry for the inconvenience. 
 Oh! Hey! Aah! 
 You like hitting girls, huh? 
 Okay, take it easy! 
 You like beating up on girls? Where's your wallet? 
 My wallet? 
 Your wallet. 
 You're gonna pay that girl's doctor bills. 
 Are you crazy, buddy?! I already paid her! 
 You already paid her?! 
 [screams] 
 Where is it? 
 Okay! 
 It's in my jacket by the desk. 
 Smith : Oh, come on, man. 
 D-don't take it all. 
 You're gonna compensate her for the work she's gonna lose, asshole. 
 What's this? 
 Oh, please, man. 
 You can't take that, too, all right?! Come on! 
 I can't? Huh? 
 [grunting] 
 Bitches.

 Patton's a no-show. 
 Looks like it. 
 Didn't he tell you that he was gonna be here? 
 Didn't you tell him that we had some business to discuss? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Where the hell is he? 
 You know that thing we talked about? 
 Get it done. 
 Tonight? 
 Tonight. 
 Tonight. 
 So, how far can I go? How far you want me to go? 
 Take his legs out. 
 Seany, glad you could make it. It's a great party. 
 Hey, Fitzy, bring us a round, keep them coming. 
 I told you there'd be a ton of broads here. 
 One in particular's very excited to see you. 
 Yeah? Who's that? 
 My sister Dee. 
 Oh, there's no way in hell that that's Deirdre. 
 Sure as sh1t is. All grown up, too. 
 Hey, but don't get any ideas. She's got the clap. 
 Oh, that's real nice. 
 They taught you manners in the joint, didn't they? 
 This guy... Seany, so, uh, what's the word on the game? 
 The nut's gonna be $500, and we get that money up front. 
 If there's no money, there's no game. 
 I'll have it for you Tuesday night. 
 No. They're gonna have it for me on Sunday at the diner. 
 And make sure you're alone. 
 Yeah. 
 Excuse me, but were you just gonna ignore me all night? 
 Dee, we're talking business. 
 Eh, that's no excuse, Mr. O'Bannon. 
 After all, it's been over five years. 
 And a lot has changed in five years. 
 Aww, shucks. I'm glad you noticed. 
 So, are you gonna buy me a drink? 
 He can get you a drink. That's all he's getting. 
 He's not my keeper anymore, Sean. 
 I'll have a 7 and 7. 
 [telephone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Hey, it's your Uncle John. 
 I was wondering if you could get together for a little talk. 
 John, I am already in for the night with the kids. 
 Eh, it won't take long. Uh, just give me five minutes. 
 [sighs] All right. I'll meet you at the pool hall. 
 ♪ I love that dirty water ♪ 
♪ I love Boston ♪

♪ I love that dirty water ♪ 
 Terrence, how you doing? 
 Oh, better than you by the look of that shiner. 
 My own kid coldcocked me. Can you believe it, huh? 
 You'd think the Jesuits would have taught him better. 
 Yeah, well, you're lucky he only gave you a beating, but I am guessing that is not why you dragged me away from my children tonight. 
 No. This is about the, uh... the celebrated return of his jackass friend, Duffy. 
 What about him? 
 He... he's a bad kid, Terry, you know, and you shouldn't let Sean get involved with him. 
 [chuckles] 
 Uncle John, I got no idea what you're talking about. 
 What do you take me for, a schmuck? 
 Uh, do you think that anyone can take a piss on the West Side and I don't know about it? 
 Come on, now, heed my warning. 
 Oh, y-y-you're warning me? 
 Did you suddenly lose control of your senses? 
 Maybe I'm... I'm hard of hearing. 
 I'm just offering you some advice. 
 Sean should take a walk away from him. 
 And there are a lot of people in this neighborhood that are none too happy that he's back. 
 Yeah, well, you can count me as one of them. 
 You're not likely to take a bat to his head. 
 But who's gonna touch him if he's got Patton protecting him? 
 Well, Patton's getting soft, all right? 
 He's too busy hobnobbing with politicians, high-class people across town. 
 He is not keeping a proper eye on the neighborhood. 
 Maybe so, but, I don't know, do you know anyone who might be dumb enough to think they could make a move on the big guy? 
 Yeah, I mean, you know, the kids... they come in here, they get to talking. 
 Well, 'maybe they got somebody whispering in their ear. 
 [laughs] No, no, no, no, no. 
 Not at all, not at all. 
 But as they're always saying to me, the times, they are a-changing. 
 [laughs] 
 You're quoting the hippies now? Oh, that's funny. 
 That is funny, Uncle John, especially coming from you. 
 But listen to me. 
 We don't need anybody rocking the boat right now. 
 Everybody is making money, and no one is getting hurt, and I fully expect it to remain that way. 
 Understood. 
 It's just that in my business... sometimes people get hurt. 
 Is that that little sh1t right there? 
 Yeah, that's him. 
 Go get that prick! 
 You better run, Duffy! You better run! 
 A knife? What are you gonna do with that, huh? 
 You didn't think you'd actually be able to catch me, did you, Hopkins? 
 I'll catch you soon enough, you little sh1t. 
 And when I do, I'm gonna take your goddamn head off. 
 Hey, if I was you, my head wouldn't be the one I'd be concerned about. 
 [indistinct conversations, laughter] 
 Is that really how you see it? 
 O'bannon : No, no. That's the way it is. 
 If your brother does not have his game on the pad, there's a very good chance he's gonna go back to jail. 
 At least this way, I can keep an eye on him and keep him safe. 
 Oh, and you think you're helping him by allowing him to set up another illegal crap game? 
 What are you worried about? 
 What do you think I'm worried about? 
 I'm worried about my brother. 
 He's not out of jail for a week, and already he's back in the life, and you're helping him. 
 Deirdre, what else is he gonna do, huh? 
 H-he never finished high school. 
 He's already been in and out of jail a few times. 
 He wanted to be in Patton's crew ever since we left Holy Cross. 
 Yeah, I blame your father for that one. 
 Well, that prick is responsible for everything rotten that's ever happened in my life, so why not blame your brother's plight on him, too? 
 Charlie, Charlie, it's not a good idea. 
 I should be going in with you. I should meet this guy. 
 I don't know. He said I had to come alone. 
 Eh, who gives a sh1t? 
 We're in this together, ain't we? 
 Besides [laughs] after what happened the other night, you're gonna need me around. 
 All right, yeah, you can come, but, uh, wait by the counter till I call you. 
 Seany, Seany, Seany. 
 How's it going? How you doing? 
 You... you eat yet? Listen, I'm starving. 
 So, uh... so, listen. 
 Yeah, I-I got what we talked about. 
 I'm a little bit shy. 
 Yeah, you're a little shy? 
 What you're shy on is brains. And your game is done. 
 Hey, Sean. 
 Sean, Sean, come on, come on! What's going on? 
 What did I tell you, huh? 
 What did I tell you? I told you to come alone, and you bring this Guinea greaseball that I don't know! 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 No, he's not a WOP... Anderson... what the hell is that? He's German. He's a Pole... 
 What the hell? What does it matter, Seany? 
 He's a good guy. I got to know him in the joint. 
 We're working together on this thing. 
 Well, you're working it together without me. 
 Sean, I'm sorry. 
 I thought you'd want to meet him if I was bringing him in. 
 You know what? This is what always gets you in trouble, Duff... you don't use your head! 
 I'm sticking my neck out for you, but you don't think about that, 'cause all you can think about is yourself! 
 You were right. I made a mistake trusting Duffy. 
 No sh1t. 
 I'm starting to think maybe all that time up in Boston affected your better judgment. 
 Come on, Terry, I had to try and help him out. 
 No, you did not have to do sh1t for him. 
 What you need to start doing is using your head. 
 God... 
 I brought you into Plainclothes because you're my cousin, but this kind of bullshit makes me look bad. 
 Okay, I get it. Duffy's out. 
 Yeah, well, what about that bullshit the other night with your old man? 
 You didn't think I was gonna hear about that? 
 You got a beef with him, you take care of that in private. 
 Did you hear what he did? Came home with his load on and beat the crap out of my mother. 
 And I'm not saying he didn't deserve it. 
 But the number-one rule in our office is you do not draw attention to yourself. 
 You have to take care of something or somebody, you do it out of the spotlight. 
 All right, Terry, I get it. 
 But I'm telling you, if he ever touches my mother again, I'll kill him. 
 Uh-oh. You okay? 
 You got that look on your face. 
 Eh, you know, it's my cousin Sean. 
 I'm just worried I made a mistake of bringing him into Plainclothes with us. 
 You know, he's one of these kids. 
 He doesn't think before he acts. 
 And now we got this other new kid in the office that's got everybody worried, as well, so, you know? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And here I was thinking you were concerned about your son James. 
 [chuckles] All right, that is not fair, Chris. 
 I am concerned about him. 
 But what I do find very interesting is, like these young cops, he, too, has no respect for authority. 
 He, too, doesn't think before he acts. 
 But he's not a cop. He's your 13-year-old son. 
 So maybe you should go in and say good night to him. 
 He's still upset. 
 You really think that will help? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 All right. 
 All right, funnyman... 
 ...don't pretend you're still sleeping. 
 Look, James, the world is filled with assholes, all right? 
 I should know. I have to deal with them all the time at work. 
 And I do not want to deal with one under my roof. 
 And it's a fine line. It's very hard to see sometimes. 
 You and your friends, you're out on the street, jerking around, having what seems like harmless fun until one day, you wake up on the wrong side of that line to discover that you have joined the ranks of the imbeciles and the assholes and the most likely to end up incarcerated. 
 And I know you don't want that, do you? 
 You are at a major fork in the road right now, kiddo, and you have a big decision to make. 
 Are you ready to put being an asshole behind you and start being the kind of person I know you can be? 
 I can be a better person. 
 Yeah, I know you can. 
 This is why I'm so tough on you. 
 Kill the light. Tomorrow's a new day. 
 [telephone ringing] 
 Yeah? All right. 
 [groans] 
 What the hell you doing here, huh? 
 [tires screeching] 
 [pounds on trunk] 
 [tires screech]

 Muldoon. 
 [sighing] Aw, sh1t. 
 [foghorn blaring] 
 Almandola : I'm pretty sure it's him. 
 He has no identification on him, so I figured you'd want to I.D. him yourself. 
 Yeah, that's him, all right.
