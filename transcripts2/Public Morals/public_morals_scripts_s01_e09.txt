 What happened? 
 Where is he? 
 [Panting] 
 Where's Danny?! Where the hell is he? 
 Stop asking so many freaking questions! Open the door. 
 [Sobbing] 
 Tell me he's okay. 
 Just say he's okay. 
 Do me a favor, Shea. 
 Hang back here, all right? 
 'Bout time I heard from you, Freddy. 
 Hope you've got something good for me. 
 Well, I got nothing on the murder of your Uncle, all right? 
 But... but come on. 
 I do got something on the pattons I know you're gonna want. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 So, according to this guy I know, right? 
 Rusty stepped out on his own. 
 This guy you know? This guy got a name? 
 Yeah, you know, that big, fat, greasy hump, Johnny Snowflakes. 
 Johnny Snowflakes? Never heard of him. 
 Ah, come on. You know Snowflakes. 
 Trust me, Freddy, I don't know anybody by that name. 
 You sure, man? He's been working for the pattons for years. 
 He's the big, fat guy... a little light in the loafers. 
 You mean John w? The whale? 
 Exactly. 
 What the hell you doing hanging out with him? 
 I was at a card game with this guy last night. 
 I was cleaning his clock. 
 Oh, yeah? That's it? 
 Yes. [Both chuckle] 
 Hear this out, okay? 
 So, the whole time we're at this card game, all he can do is piss and moan about Rusty. 
 Rusty's got this guy managing a gay bar, and this fat b*st*rd is nervous as all hell because he knows Rusty's doing his gay-bar thing on the side away from his old man. 
 That's pretty good, Freddy. 
 All right, he say where this spot is? 
 Uh, meat-packing district. Uh, Washington off Horatio. 
 All right, and Wallace says that his is one of Rusty's joints? 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. That's what's got this guy so damn nervous. 
 He don't want no part of double-crossing the big guy. 
 He knows what it'll get him. 
 This is good, Freddy. This is real good. 
 Telling ya, man, I know. 
 So, come on. I mean, work a little magic for me now? 
 Get me back in that parlor lane? I was making a killing there. 
 Look, this pans out, I will take care of that. 
 And I actually might have some other sh1t that we might need to discuss. 
 All right. 
 You stay in touch. 
 Will do. 
 You know me... anything you need. 
 [Sighs] 
 All right. 
 Well, that must be the joint right there. 
 So, what do we do? 
 Well, I'm gonna stay here and listen to the radio. 
 You're gonna go in there and act like you belong. 
 Now, that doesn't mean you're gonna swoosh into the place and prance around like a ballerina, okay? 
 Just act natural, like maybe you're a fresh-faced kid who took the Long Island rail road in from queens. 
 Ah, come on. 
 Is this like the fight with Vince or some other part of my initiation or something? 
 No, Shea. No, this is the real deal. 
 I need you to go in and see if you can identify the guy who runs this place. 
 Know what he looks like? 
 Yeah, you're not gonna be able to miss him. 
 His nickname is Snowflakes, but his real name is John Wallace. 
 If he's in there, you just come right back out. 
 You let me know. Think you can handle that? 
 Yeah.

 Excuse me. Could I have a beer, please? 
 Thank you. 
 New to the big city? 
 Who? Me? 
 Who else might I be speaking to? 
 Uh... Yeah. 
 I'm from out of town. 
 I could tell. 
 I can always tell when a young man is new to the big city. 
 Want to know how I can tell? 
 No. Not really. 
 [Sniffles] 
 How'd you hear about this place, anyhow? 
 Supposed to be a private club. 
 A friend. 
 He said he knows the guy that runs the joint. 
 Your friend must be a rough customer if he knows Johnny Snowflakes. 
 Not really. Why? 
 What's so scary about him? 
 Look for yourself. 
 So everything's all right? 
 It's all good, boss. 
 So that could happen. 
 [Chuckles] 
 They say he's a very dangerous man, even though he's one of us. 
 "One of us"? 
 You sure you're in the right place? 
 Yeah I am sure. 
 Rosemary : You want me to read you something tonight? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Yeah, I guess that'd be nice. 
 I thought you were going out. 
 Nah, they can wait. 
 What would you like? 
 Shakespeare? "Yeets"? The Bible? 
 That's Yeats. 
 So much for Spence. 
 And anything but the Bible. 
 All right. 
 "Yeets" it is. 
 [Chuckling] Oh, God. 
 "The old men admiring themselves in the water. I heard the old, old men say, 'everything alters, and one by one, we drop away.' they had hands like claws, and their knees were twisted like the old Thorn-trees by the waters. I heard the old, old men say, 'all that's beautiful drifts away.'" 
 Good choice, kid. 
 You trying to give me a message? 
 [Chuckles] 
 So? Any sign of him? 
 Yeah. Yeah, he's, uh... there's a door behind the bar. He's in there. 
 He must have an office back there, something like that. 
 All right, when we go in, you wait by the front door, and, uh, I'll let you know if I need ya. 
 Yeah. 
 [Up-tempo music playing] 
 Hey. You're not allowed back there. 
 Whoa! Johnny Wallace. Hey, I hate to break up the party. 
 sh1t. Muldoon. What the hell are you doing here? 
 I should be asking you the same thing. 
 Kid, take a hike. Come on. Let's go. Move it. 
 John, what is going on here? 
 You know you can't have what's going on upstairs without us having it on the list, and nobody at the office knows about this. 
 Oh, it's not what you think, Terry. 
 I-I-I just manage the joint. 
 All right. All right. Fair enough. 
 So, uh, who are you managing it for? 
 Come on, Terry. 
 You know I can't tell you that. 
 You want to take the fall for this, be my guest. 
 I don't care. 
 But you should know everyone is gonna assume that this is your joint, and they're gonna assume everything that goes along with that. 
 By the way, I love the ascot. 
 We'll see you around, John. 
 But no, no, no. Terry, Terry, come on. 
 Listen to reason, please. You listen to me. 
 Terry, please wait. 
 Listen to me. You got to listen to me. Please. 
 I can't let anybody find out about this. 
 You understand? 
 I mean, if anybody finds out about this, you know what they're gonna do to me. 
 Yeah, I completely understand, which is why you need to tell me whose joint this is, or I'm gonna have to tell every bartender on 10th Avenue how you've been spending your Saturday nights. 
 Come on. What? We go back a long way. Come on. 
 Oh, we do. We do. 
 And you know the only way to safe your ass is by talking. 
 It's Rusty Patton's place. 
 Is that a fact, huh? Mm-hmm. 
 And what does the old man think about all this? 
 Oh, he don't know anything about this. 
 This is Rusty's own deal. 
 Yeah? And how many other spots like this does he have? 
 He's got two others down here on the West Side. 
 Uh... One's an after-hours club. 
 The other's a joint just like this. 
 And you're trying to tell me that the big guy knows nothing about these spots? 
 I swear. No, no. He knows nothing. 
 Swear. 
 All right, John. 
 That's all I need. 
 And don't worry. 
 Your secret is safe with me. 
 [Sighs] 
 So, what? We're not gonna make a single arrest? 
 [Engine turns over] 
 Well, who would you have liked us to grab? 
 We could've had anybody in that place. 
 Oh, yeah? And what good would that have done? 
 They were breaking the law. 
 Yeah? Well, it's a stupid law. 
 S-so why'd we even bother going down there? 
 Because there were other things at play. 
 And in that respect, it was a very successful night. 
 May I ask what that was? 
 Well, let me put it this way. 
 There are the laws, and there are the rules. 
 And over time, you will learn to identify the difference. 
 Oh, you're up. 
 Terry : How'd it go with the kids this morning? 
 It's fine. 
 We need to talk. 
 About what? 
 I want to talk about the house. 
 All right. 
 Well, first of all, we are not borrowing any money from my parents. 
 Why not? Your father offered to help. 
 It's not like I asked him. He's the one who brought it up. 
 Yeah, because you're always harping about how miserable you are here and how much you hate the city. 
 And you know what's amazing about your father? 
 Unlike you, he listens to me. 
 And we  are  miserable here. This apartment is too small, and the neighborhood is going to sh1t. 
 Neighborhood is fine. 
 It's no different from when I was a kid. 
 Well, I guess it was sh1t back then, too. 
 I'm fed up, Terry. 
 I don't understand. Why don't you want to leave? 
 I mean, I think we'd all love an explanation as to what's so great about living in hell's kitchen. 
 Well, you know what? It's the little things. 
 If we were living out in Queens, I wouldn't be able to come home during the day like I do and eat with the kids. 
 If that's your only reason, don't worry. 
 We'll be happy to save the leftovers for you. 
 I can't do it anymore, Terry. I got to get out of this place. 
 I don't want our kids walking home from school, talking about the different street corners where this one was killed and that one was stabbed. 
 I want to be able to open up the front door and let them go out and play at night and not have to worry about a run-in with some drunken, homicidal lunatic. 
 Now, I'm accepting the loan from your parents, and me and the kids are moving. 
 You can either join us, or you can stay here in your beloved hovel, but we're moving. 
 And if you don't like it, too goddamn bad about you.

 Hello, Mr. Patton. 
 Uh, sorry to call you at home, sir. 
 This is John Wallace. 
 John, what can I do for ya? 
 Well, it's about Rusty, sir. 
 Before you found out from anyone else, I wanted you to know that he's been, well, taking business off the map. 
 Is that a fact? 
 What kind of business? 
 Well, he's been fronting a couple of bars. 
 Uh... Bars for queers. 
 And, uh, last night, we got raided by Terry Muldoon. 
 You said "we." 
 Are you involved in this, John? 
 O-only because Rusty wanted me to, but I swear, I told him it was a very bad idea. 
 Of course, Muldoon was asking who ran the place. 
 Of course, I... I didn't tell him sh1t, but he knew it was Rusty, so I figured you'd want to know since they're gonna grab Rusty over this. 
 But I just want to be clear with you, sir. 
 Mr. Patton, I wasn't the one who ratted to the cops. 
 Well, thank you, John. 
 Thank you very much. 
 You did right by telling me. 
 Now, if I were you, I'd get out of this town shortly, if not sooner. 
 Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

 Okay, so, do you think it's Sean... or Don? 
 It has to be Sean. I didn't sleep with Don. 
 How late are you? 
 A few weeks. 
 That doesn't mean you're pregnant. 
 I know. 
 It's just, I haven't been feeling really well lately. 
 I almost fainted the other morning, and, clearly, I'm throwing up every day. 
 You got to go to the doctor and find out for sure. 
 I can't. 
 Why not? 
 He's been my doctor since I was a little girl. 
 We're catholic. 
 How am I supposed to tell him that I think I'm pregnant? 
 Okay, you'll go to my doctor. 
 Okay? 
 Let me call him right now. 
 And what do I do if I am? 
 We're not there yet. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Trucking and storage. 
 Thomas, why don't you talk to me about gay bars. 
 I told him it was a bad idea. 
 You told him, but you didn't tell me. 
 Well, I knew you wouldn't be happy about it. 
 You're goddamn right I'm not happy about it. 
 I have a good mind to give Muldoon what he wants, and do you know what he wants, Thomas? 
 He wants Rusty. 
 Wait a minute. 
 L-l-let me talk to Rusty, okay? He listens to me. 
 We're done with talking to him. 
 You tell him that he is no longer welcome in my life. 
 Do you understand? 
 From now on, as far as I'm concerned, my son... if he really was my son... is dead to me. 
 He's dead to me. 
 And by the way, Thomas, you're dead to me, too. 
 You've proven to me where your loyalties lie. 
 You want to help Rusty continue down this... this path to madness? 
 Well, you can do it without my support. 
 And you can do it without my protection. 
 Do you understand? 
 Without my protection, God damn you! 
 [Sighs] 
 Monk. 
 I've got to put some things into motion... 
 About that little trip that we discussed. 
 Understand? 
 Battalina : You're not gonna believe it, Irish. 
 The West Side crazies finally made the papers. 
 Now, granted, it's page 22, but at least we got some ink. 
 You know that prick there? 
 Yeah, I'd like all the help you can give me on this, err. 
 Yeah, well, somebody downtown must think that I've got some major hooks here in hell's kitchen, because, uh, guess who caught the case. 
 Well, they must figure you been doing such a good job on all the other West Side homicides, they got to give it to their top dog, right? 
 [Chuckling] You know what, you donkey prick? 
 It wouldn't surprise me if you and your old man weren't juicing somebody at headquarters to keep sticking me with these bullshit cases. 
 Tony, Tony, I swear to ya, I would never do anything like that, and neither would my father, especially considering he'd actually like to see these cases solved. 
 Hey, this might come as a surprise to you, wise ass. 
 I'd like to nail this Rusty prick, too, and it... it's not because I don't want to eat another meal in that godforsaken neighborhood, Terry. 
 W-what... these murders get a little bit of ink, and all the sudden you have a change of heart, huh, Tony? 
 No, no. That's not it. 
 I-I-it's just one thing when skels are killing skels. 
 I mean, nobody gives a sh1t who's doing it, right? 
 I mean, they're doing the citizens of the city a favor. 
 It's this Rusty guy. It's different, Terry. 
 It's like he's not doing it for money. 
 He's not doing it for power. It's for turf. 
 I mean, this lunatic, he's, like... he's killing people for sport, Terr. 
 I don't believe what I'm hearing. 
 It sounds to me like Tony B. 
 Is finally all-in on this case, huh? 
 Yeah, I'd like all the help you can give me on this, Terr. 
 All right, well, because of him and the fact that he shot up half of my neighborhood, I'm driving out to queens today to look at a house. 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
 Terry Muldoon is actually leaving hell's kitchen. 
 [Chuckling] I never thought I'd see the day. 
 All right, settle down, my dago friend. I'm just looking. 
 Oh, yeah? Famous last words, Irish. Look at me... exiled to Howard beach for the last 15 years. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Who is it? 
 You screwed up, Rusty. 
 Your father found out about the gay bars. 
 Big freakin' deal. What did he say? 
 He said you're done. 
 He don't want anything more to do with you... or me, for that matter. 
 What's the cause for alarm, Uncle Red? 
 He was done with me a long time ago. 
 This is different. We're out. 
 What's the "we" all of a sudden? 
 I thought you were staying loyal to my father. 
 I don't want to hear your bullshit right now, Rusty! 
 We got things to discuss. 
 We got to fix this mess. 
 Why don't you meet me down at the pool hall in an hour? 
 All right. 
 Well, thanks again, Mrs. Heinz. 
 And you were not lying. 
 The house is beautiful. The block is beautiful. 
 Uh-huh. 
 But you should know, Terrance... that my husband commuted for 40 years... 
 38 minutes, door to door. 
 Now, if he could do it, so could you. 
 [Chuckling] All right. Do me a favor... just keep this little visit to yourself, all right? 
 Your secret is safe with me, Terrance.

 Oh, thank you. 
 I'm glad you like it. 
 You're comfortable here on the couch? 
 Yes, very. 
 Okay. 
 So, where are you from, Nick? 
 I'd, um... I'd rather not say. 
 Okay. That's fine. 
 Some people like to talk a little bit first, but if not, that's okay. 
 Should we just go to the bedroom, or... 
 No. 
 No, no. I'm fine. 
 Um, I can talk. 
 Uh, I actually live here in town. 
 Okay. 
 And what do you do? 
 I'm in publishing... uh, Motherway and Kriegel. 
 Uh, and, uh, I got divorced a few years ago, and... 
 I've been lonely. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 You know, it can be a hard city to meet people in when you're older and you're shy like me. 
 That's understandable. 
 New York can be a very lonely place. 
 Some of the men I know, they go to bars after work, or they start up affairs with girls in the office, but I'm just [Sighs] not that outgoing. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, it's a good thing you got my number, then. 
 You don't have to worry about any of that here. 
 I promise I'll make you very comfortable. 
 Can I give you a kiss? 
 I'd rather you didn't. 
 Okay. 
 May I? 
 How about this? Is this okay? 
 Yes. 
 Give me your hand. 
 See? 
 Feels nice, right? 
 Very. 
 [Mid-tempo music playing] 
 What's up, Petey? Hey, quick word. 
 Let me ask you something. 
 You and I seem to be the only two who like this college kid. 
 What do you think? Is he gonna make the cut or what? 
 I wouldn't sweat it, Petey. 
 You and I both know that kid is well-covered. 
 That's for sure. 
 What do you say, Farrell? 
 Terry, FYI, your old man's on a rampage. 
 Called here five times looking for you. 
 Huh. Well, you do me a favor. 
 If he calls again, you can't find me. 
 Captain, quick word? 
 Huh? 
 You asked, and I deliver. 
 Your tickets for the show tonight. 
 But brace yourself... it's four hours long. 
 You might want to bring a flask. 
 Well, thank you, Captain. 
 You're gonna make me look like a hero to Mrs. Muldoon. 
 Be sure to wish her a Happy Birthday for me. 
 Will do. 
 Let's talk about Shea. I'm seeing his father this weekend. 
 What am I saying? 
 The kid's all right in my book, and more importantly, he can be trusted. 
 Now, granted, he's young, he's green, but he's also smart, and he's proven he does not take any sh1t. 
 All right, then. It's settled. 
 I'll let his father know. 
 Tell me the latest with this bullshit on the West Side. 
 All right, good news is Battalina's back on the case now that another one of Mr. O's guys has ended up D.O.A. 
 Can he tie Rusty to it? 
 Not yet, which is why I'm hoping I grab Rusty for the gay bars and see if we can squeeze him. 
 I still can't believe that. 
 What the hell is this world coming to when an Irish catholic gangster starts fronting gay bars? 
 Yeah, well, we are living in different times, Captain. 
 And you're sure all these places are actually being run by Rusty and not Patton himself? 
 My guy Wallace swears that it's Rusty's, and I've had other stoolies tell me that Rusty's been taking some other action and hiding it from the big guy. 
 So what's your plan? 
 Take it to Patton this afternoon, put the ball in his court. 
 He's not gonna be happy to hear that Rusty's taking business off the map. 
 He's certainly not gonna be happy to hear that he's involved with this fairy business. 
 Which is why I'm hoping he's gonna distance himself from the whole goddamn thing. 
 All right, let's hope Patton's smart enough to know this is the smart play. 
 [Sighs] He's been at this too long to let this psycho continue like this. 
 I think he knows if he insists on covering for Rusty, this ends badly for him. 
 I'm hoping he's gonna point me in Rusty's direction, or, who knows, if we're lucky, take care of it himself and save us all one big headache. 
 [Grunts] 
 What's going on, Monk? 
 Grandpa, why are the suitcases packed? 
 Are you going someplace? 
 [Sighs] We both are. 
 We're going to California to visit your Uncle Gerry. 
 But why? What happened? 
 Nothing happened. Come here. 
 It's not important what happened. 
 What's important... you promise me that you're gonna go to college next year in Los Angeles. 
 Now, you're gonna be well taken care of by your Uncle Gerry. 
 I want you to go to college. 
 I want you to promise me also that when you leave this city, you'll never come back. 
 Grandpa, I could never do that. 
 That means I wouldn't see you ever again. 
 I'm not long for this town, myself, dear. 
 Grandpa, what's going on? 
 How serious is this? 
 I'm done here. 
 I... 
 I'm gonna settle all the legitimate business and just sell them off. 
 I'm leaving everything to you and to your Uncle Gerry. 
 What about Rusty and Tommy? 
 We've, uh... We've had a parting of the ways. 
 So then who's gonna take over? 
 Ah. 
 The West Side's all done. 
 I'll leave it to the wolves... let them fight over the scraps. 
 But you can't just walk away. 
 People depend on you in this neighborhood. 
 You're a legend. 
 Legends are for another time, dear. 
 I'm just a tired old man. 
 Ah. Monk is gonna drive you to the airport. 
 Now, it's really important... you must tell no one that you're going, and certainly not  where  you're going. 
 It's important that you just disappear for a while. 
 You'll drop out. You understand? 
 Not for long... a month, maybe two. 
 You'll be able to reconnect with your friends. 
 I'm gonna be here for a few days, tying up a few loose ends, but I'll be out there to join you tomorrow, the next day, day after. 
 Why can't I just go with you then? 
 Darling, [Sighs] Listen to me. 
 Now, I haven't had to raise my voice with you since you were a little girl, and I don't want to start now, so please, please, just get in the car and go to the airport. 
 Ah, but... 
 Come back to me. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Both chuckle] 
 You look like your grandmother in Kilmanagh, 1928. 
 I love you. 
 Everything's gonna be just fine, all right? 
 All right, go on now. Go. 
 [Clears throat] 
 All right, make sure she gets to the gate. 
 Make sure she talks to no one, you understand? 
 And no one talks to her. 
 All right, be careful. 
 Farrell, Shea still out there? 
 Have a seat. 
 I'm seeing your father tomorrow. 
 And, uh, hope to tell him how pleased you are with your assignment. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Any complaints? 
 No, sir. 
 Sure about that? 
 That was nothing. 
 Good to hear. 
 Some cops just don't understand what we do here. 
 It's a tricky bit of business, working vice. 
 We're asked to, uh, fight sin rather than crime, and that's better left with clergy, in my opinion. 
 Yes, sir. 
 We all like to dabble from time to time. 
 Sure. [Chuckles] 
 It'd be good to have a man on the inside, someone to keep an eye over things for me. 
 We both know why your father wanted you in here. 
 Now that you're in, let's see that you get what he expects. 
 Yes, sir. I couldn't agree more. 
 That'll be all, Shea. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 [Clears throat] 
 I know you're not gonna be happy about it, Lonny, but Shea's gonna stay. 
 His old man's a boss. 
 I know better than to get in the way of that. 
 And Muldoon trusts him, which makes the kid okay in my book. 
 Yeah, but, Cap, listen, I want to bring my nephew in, too, all right? 
 I mean, he's a tough young cop... smart, too. 
 I mean, he could be a lot of help to me uptown. 
 You're a real asset in this office, Lonny, and I'll do everything I can to make that happen. 
 Just give it a month or so, and I'll see what I can do. 
 Besides, there's, uh, someone in this office who's overstayed their welcome. 
 Okay, well, before you cut anybody loose, give me a heads-up, now. 
 It goes with that saying, Loony. 
 If that's all our business for the day, Lieutenant, I have a very important matter to attend to. 
 Tell her I said hello. 
 What are you still doing here, Shea? You should be out celebrating. 
 All right. Welcome aboard. 
 Hope you had a nice time, Nick. 
 I did. [Chuckles] 
 I had a very nice time. 
 Thank you. 
 Hopefully I'll see you again. 
 Yeah. 
 Excuse me, Nick? 
 Mm-hmm? 
 I think maybe you miscounted. 
 No, it's all there. 
 No, I-it's supposed to be $200. 
 This is only $150. 
 And we agreed on $150. 
 No. My rate is always $200. 
 It's what we discussed on the phone and what we discussed when you first came over. 
 No, I specifically remember we agreed on $150. 
 Now, I'm late for work, and I should get going. 
 Y-y-you are not going anywhere until I get my money. 
 And what are you going to do if I don't pay, you stupid bitch? 
 Call the cops? 
 I know you don't have a pimp because your friend told me you're independent, so you can either take the money from me or you can let me walk out of here right now. 
 Or maybe you could call the cops.

 [Elevator clanks, whirs] 
 So, Monk, let me ask you... how long, uh, how long you been working for the big guy? 
 Oh, really? You don't say. That long, huh? 
 So, what, did you guys grow up together? 
 Oh, 44th street? Really? 'Cause I grew up on 39th street. 
 Yeah, right off of 10th Avenue there. 
 Yeah, now, myself, the holy cross for grammar school, then power memorial. 
 Hmm. 
 So, what's going on, Uncle Lonny? 
 You still interested in working plainclothes? 
 Yeah. Who wouldn't be? 
 How's night school going? Hitting them books? 
 I'm trying to. But it's... it's hard. 
 It's a... it's a lot of distractions. 
 Yeah, I'm sure ain't no shortage of pussy when you're wearing that blue suit. [Laughs] 
 I just don't want to hear about you having  too  good of a time. 
 Be smart about the money. 
 I'm doing just like you told me. 
 I put half in the bank in my mother's name. 
 And the other half? 
 Where nobody can find it. 
 Listen, a spot may be opening up again. 
 I'm gonna do everything in my power to make it happen. 
 You'll find out that this division ain't like the rest of the P.D. 
 The bond here is all about the money. 
 The only color that matters is green. 
 Therefore, everybody got to trust everybody, else we're all dead. 
 So you just play it smart and make some friends. 
 Save your money. Hit them books. 
 One day, you're gonna be a boss. 
 And I'll tell you, it's a whole lot easier being a black cop when you make lieutenant. 
 Or, better yet, a captain. 
 Or, hell, maybe even a damn chief. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Mr. Patton. 
 We need to speak alone. 
 Ah, Monk, give us a minute, will you? 
 So, does the Monk ever speak? 
 Only to me. 
 That's what makes him so valuable. 
 Loose lips sink ships, huh? 
 Ah, something like that. 
 Did you, uh, serve in the war, Muldoon? 
 The Navy. How about you? 
 The first war, the great war. 
 I was with the fighting 69th. 
 Just like James Cagney. 
 We had a guy like Plunkett in our unit, but he... he didn't end up a war hero. 
 We saw to that. 
 Oh, I'm sure you did. 
 So, you must have known, I guess, father Duffy, as well, then? 
 He  was  a hero. 
 I helped to get that statue of him put up in Times Square. 
 Always doing the good deed for the neighborhood. 
 Damn right, young man. don't you forget it. 
 I'm not breaking balls. I'm being sincere. 
 Remember, I was at holy cross when you got all those new uniforms for the C.Y.O. teams, and I've seen you over the years giving out the turkeys on Thanksgiving and the presents at Christmas. 
 And like most people in the neighborhood, I admire a lot of what you do. 
 Is that what this conversation is about... you telling me how much you admire me? 
 Partly. 
 I know you're a very smart man. 
 You've done what you do for a very long time, and you have made very few mistakes, which is how you've managed to stay out of the can when almost everybody else has done time at some point or another. 
 Enough of the vaseline. 
 Let's cut to the point, Muldoon. What's it about? 
 It's about your son Rusty. 
 Unlike you, he is making some very costly errors. 
 Would you care to elaborate on that? 
 I don't want to hear about this imaginary war. 
 In addition to everything else he's been up to, he's also got some action he's been hiding from us, and I suspect hiding from you. 
 We busted a gay bar that he's fronting, and we know of two other spots he's got, and I know there must be some other sh1t that he's taken off the map. 
 So before we bring him in, I figured, out of respect for you, I should come and let you know about it. 
 You're wrong about one thing. 
 I knew about the gay bars. 
 I told Rusty that he had to talk to you about getting them on the list. 
 And that was my mistake, I guess. 
 I should have dealt with you personally on that. 
 All right. 
 You tell me what the number is on these two places, I'll take care of it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You expect me to believe that bullshit, that  you  knew about a bunch of gay bars and you okayed that? 
 Yes, I expect you to believe it. It's the truth. 
 The truth. 
 Mr. Patton, I'm gonna tell you what the truth is. 
 The truth is, from this day forward, you and I are done, and the relationship that you and your organization has with me and my office is also terminated. 
 I came here today expecting to speak to a reasonable man, but obviously I misjudged you. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, that's true. You  have  misjudged me. 
 You've always misjudged me. 
 Well, you're not the first to have misjudged me, and you won't be the last. 
 Monk! 
 See this officer out. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm afraid your luck has run out, Mr. Patton. 
 This is the mistake that will cost you. 
 Mark my words. 
 Man : Hey, Rusty. 
 You got a call. 
 This is the mistake that will cost you. 
 Yeah? 
 What? 
 You got to be sh1tting me. 
 Whoa, whoa! Take it easy, pal! 
 Whoa! You got a problem? 
 Rusty. No, man, I ain't got no problem. 
 What the hell's going on? Rusty. 
 Get him out of here. 
 Get him out of here! 
 Get out of here, shitbag! 
 Okay, everybody, you heard him. 
 That's it. We're closing up for today. 
 Guys, take a walk around the block. 
 What's going on? 
 That was Dennis Fagan. 
 You know anything about a meeting at the warehouse with all the bosses tonight? 
 No. What did he say? 
 Old son of a bitch called for a special meeting, told him it was urgent. 
 Corky, Handigan, McBratney, even that lunatic from bay Ridge, JP Dolan... they're all gonna be there. 
 Circling the wagons. 
 [Punches hand] 
 I told you you were going too far with all this killing. 
 I told you to lie low. You wouldn't listen to me. 
 I did what needed to be done. 
 Oh, that matters now?! 
 Yes! 
 What matters?! 
 What matters is you're gonna need to disappear for a little while, Rusty. 
 You got to let your father settle down here. 
 Why the hell would I do that? If I disappear, when I get back, there may be nothing left for us. 
 Now, we don't know that. 
 I can talk to your old man. 
 I can... I can... I can get him to see past this. 
 But the most important thing right now is that we don't get him any more upset than he already is, and you don't get hurt while everybody's all emotional. 
 And that's why you need to leave. 
 I'm not going anywhere, Uncle Red, and you need to pick a frickin' side. 
 Aw! 
 Who are you with... him or me? 
 Hey! 
 This is it. This is the moment. 
 It's us against him. If we don't act now, he wins. 
 Are you with me? 
 How far are you willing to take this, Rusty, huh? How far? 
 You said you were gonna take this all way. 
 That's what we were gonna do, and that's what we're  gonna  do. 
 [Groans] 
 You out of your mind, Rusty? 
 You're talking about killing your own father, here. 
 My father? 
 Is that a joke? 
 You know he was never a father to me. 
 I'm not talking about the rumors, either. 
 What's wrong, Uncle Red? You didn't think I knew about that? 
 No, I... This is crazy. Is it? 
 Rusty, you're just talking crazy now. 
 Am I? 
 Yeah. 
 Is it the truth? 
 Is he my father or not? 
 Who knows? I don't know. There was talk, that's all. 
 She felt to need to betray him I am sure she had a good reason. 
 Where are you going, Rusty? 
 Rusty, don't do anything stupid.
