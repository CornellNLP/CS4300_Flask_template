 [Ringing] 
 Joe : Who is this? 
 I might say it's your son, but I'm hearing that might not be the truth anymore. 
 I have nothing to say to you, Rusty. 
 Nothing more? 
 Well, that would imply you actually  had  something to say to me at some point. 
 When I think about it... 
 I can't remember us ever having a conversation. 
 Remember you yelling at me, screaming at me, calling me asshole, beating the sh1t out of me. 
 But I can't remember us ever having a conversation. 
 Well, I can. 
 I can remember having a rather lovely heart-to-heart chat with you. 
 You... you must've been about 18 years old. 
 The first time you were locked up for some meaningless bullshit strong-arm crap that you'd done. 
 You remember that? 
 I remember saying to you, Rusty, "Rusty, you've got to take a different road. 
 A new approach. 
 Those days are over and done with. 
 That kind of behavior, that violent-streak behavior is no longer gonna be tolerated by me or by the police." 
 And do you remember what you said to me? 
 No, I don't. You don't. 
 Well, that's why we've never had a talk like that since. 
 Do you understand? 
 Because you don't remember sh1t. 
 You don't know sh1t. You never learn sh1t. 
 Good night, Rusty. Have a good night. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Hold on. 
 I got to ask you one thing. 
 Is it true? 
 Is what true? 
 Am I not your son? 
 I don't know. 
 But if you ever were really my son... 
 You're my son no longer. 
 [Receiver clicks] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Chuckling] Oh, look who it is. 
 What a surprise. 
 The sarge has paid us a visit. 
 Hey, kids. How's everybody doing? 
 Kate : Hey, daddy. 
 Michael : Hey, dad. 
 James : Hey, dad. 
 I hope you are here to apologize to me. 
 For what? For helping you out? For saving your marriage? 
 Saving my marriage? 
 My marriage is fine, but the more you butt into my sh1t, the more problems you create. 
 Hey, leave your father alone. 
 See what I'm talking about? 
 So, what are you doing here, dad? 
 What's the purpose of this visit tonight? 
 What? I can't come by to see my grandkids? 
 No, no, of course you can. 
 I'm sure they'd love to see you. 
 Hey, kids, what kind of fun stuff did you do with grandpa tonight? 
 We watched TV. 
 Homework. 
 Oh. Eh, nothing. That figures. 
 If you don't mind, gonna have a conversation with my wife now. 
 Try and stay out of it. 
 Yeah. 
 So, I assume you're still mad at me? 
 No, I'm not mad. 
 I'm disappointed in you, confused by you. 
 Disappointed. That's worse. 
 I would rather you were still pissed off at me. 
 Those are the breaks. 
 Well, maybe I can make it up to you by taking you out for your birthday tonight. 
 And I thought you forgot. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 I've been out all day planning this night for you. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah, I got tickets to a show, I made reservations at a very nice restaurant... 
 And, uh, my dad's gonna watch the kids for us. 
 Are you sure? 'Cause he never mentioned that. 
 He didn't mention that? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 Didn't he? Hey, dad. 
 You knew today was Christine's birthday, right? 
 I mean, that's why you came over to visit. 
 No, I had no idea. Why didn't you say something? 
 Happy Birthday, beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 And you know what she would love more than anything? 
 For you to stay home tonight and watch the kids so I can take her out to dinner and a show. 
 What do you say? What'd I tell you? 
 He'd love nothing more. 
 And, pops, I promise you when I get home later, we can talk about the case. 
 Thank you, Mr. Muldoon. 
 [  Indistinct talking on TV ] 
 Thanks, sweetheart. 
 Now, what do you want to talk about? 
 So, me and Ryan have been thinking, and we think it would be best to have a small wedding instead. 
 Well, why's that? 
 Well, since we don't have a big family with just the boys and me. 
 Und mich hast du vergessen. 
 And since Ryan's family is so big with his eight brothers and sisters and all their kids, and we just think it would be best to keep it small and simple. 
 How small you thinking? 
 Just us and you and Ryan's parents. 
 Und schon wieder sagst du das. 
 Ich soll nicht dabei sein? 
 No, mom. Nobody's leaving you out. 
 Let her talk. 
 Well, why do you want to do that? 
 I already told you I could pay for the wedding as long as you guys don't go overboard. 
 I know. 
 But this is what we want. 
 Are you sure? 
 Come on, sweetheart. I-it's your day. 
 I want it to be a special day. 
 I don't want you to think you're doing me any favors, Agnes. 
 All right? 
 I could take care of it. 
 You know, I'll find the money if I have to. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Okay? 
 Hello? 
 Fortune : Hey, Charlie. It's me. 
 I know you said to only use this number in case of an emergency, but I need to see you. 
 Hey, how are you, Sarge? 
 Yeah, I, uh... I can meet you later tonight. 
 I-I'm supposed to work tonight, Charlie. 
 You can't come now? 
 Yeah, no. 
 Uh, I'm sorry, Sarge. I can't do it. 
 Okay, I-I have a date at 8:00 at the Waldorf. 
 Maybe you could meet me before that at the bar? 
 All right, let's, uh... let's say 7:30. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 All right, thank you. 
 I'll see you soon, Sarge. 
 [Sighs] Look, I-I don't want to hear another thing about a small wedding, all right? 
 Tell Ryan your father said it was a stupid idea and we're sticking to the original plan. 
 Okay? 
 I don't want to talk about any money. 
 Okay, daddy. Thank you. 
 Charlie, du verwoehnst sie. 
 I got it, mom. 
 Mr. Handy, how are you? 
 Ah, J.P. 
 Congratulations are in order, I hear. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 The old man was all too happy to walk away. 
 You got to see the place he got himself in Palm Beach. 
 Right on the golf course. 
 Ah. I got to be thinking about that myself. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So, we got any idea what's going on here? 
 Uh, it's probably about Rusty. 
 Like your father, I know the big guy's been thinking of retiring. 
 I just hope he puts Tommy in charge. 
 [Jazz music playing] 
 Hey, pal. 
 You gonna drink it or just stare at it all night long? 
 [Chuckles] 
 What's your name, friend? 
 Ed. What's yours? 
 None of your goddamn business. 
 What do you do for a living, Ed? 
 I work in advertising. 
 Wife and kids? 
 Yeah. 
 Got an 18-year-old boy. 
 When you get home tonight, I want you to give him a hug and a kiss, and then I want you to thank the good lord that you've just been spared. 
 Will you do that for me, Ed? 
 Will you? 
 Yes. 
 [Music continues] 
 Gentlemen, all I can say is that I appreciate your sentiment. 
 But my decision is final. 
 There comes a point in every man's life when he knows it's time to walk away, and that time for me is now. 
 I'm envious of you, Joe. 
 I wish I had the balls or the brains to walk away. 
 Eh, sadly both balls and brains seem to be lacking in the West Side these days. 
 [Laughter] 
 All right, here's the way it will go down, gents. 
 Now, J.P., your father and I have agreed that both the dolans and the handigans should split control of the unions. 
 My pops filled me in, Mr. Patton. 
 You're leaving Brooklyn in good hands. 
 And, Handigan, of course, your organization will keep control of the West Side. 
 And you'll add all of our gambling and bookmaking operations to that. 
 And we'll keep your people on, too, Joe. 
 You tell them that. 
 And, Corky, you'll, uh, keep control of the loan sharking, of course. 
 But now you'll have the numbers, as well. 
 Thank you. 
 And, uh, same be true here. 
 All your guys stay on. 
 That's good. 
 But here's the most important thing. 
 From this day forward... none of you will have anything to do with my son, Rusty. 
 Or my brother, Tom. 
 As far as I'm concerned, from now on, they're fair game. 
 Do you understand? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Yes. Yes, sir. 
 Well, gentlemen. 
 Let's raise our glasses to Joe Patton... hell's kitchen's favorite son. 
 Hear, hear. 
 Illegitimate son. 
 [Laughter] 
 What do you want me to say? 
 She insisted on a personal escort home, and I was more than happy to oblige. 
 You kidding me? That old broad? She wasn't that old, was she? 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 What does it matter? 
 You did the right thing. You walked her home. 
 Whether or not you should've banged her, it was too dark for me to tell. 
 Oh, trust me, I did the right thing. 
 Oh yeah? 
 O'Bannon, you got a call. 
 I'll transfer it to your desk. 
 Hello? 
 Deirdre : Sean, hey. It's, uh... it's Dee. 
 I'm sorry to call you at work. 
 It's just... it's... it's an emergency. 
 What kind of an emergency? 
 Got another asshole at your apartment that needs car remodeling? 
 Sean, I'm sorry about that, okay? 
 But he was a friend. 
 Nothing happened, I promise. 
 Yeah, I'm sure that's why you came to the window wearing nothing but your robe. 
 What do you want me to say, Sean? I'm sorry. 
 Well, I'm sorry, too. 
 And please extend my condolences to your buddy's windshield. 
 Sean, please. 
 Please, look, I need to speak with you... it's serious. 
 Oh, serious? 
 I thought you didn't want to get serious. 
 Sean, please stop being cute. 
 I wouldn't be calling you if it wasn't important. 
 Listen, Dee, whatever it is, I don't care, because you know what? 
 I got nothing to say to you. 
 Yeah. He's got a new broad in town... my grandma. 
 Right, Seanie? 
 That's hilarious. 
 [Dial tone] 
 He works for Motherway and Kriegel. 
 He said it's a publishing company. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Anything else? 
 No. 
 And you never met this guy before? 
 No. 
 He said he got my number from a friend of his, but he didn't say who. 
 All right. 
 He didn't hurt you or anything, did he? 
 No. He just shorted me. 
 All right, well, uh, I'll find out what I can about him. 
 I'll track him down. Don't worry about it. 
 Thank you. 
 Of course. 
 And thanks again for the other night. 
 My mom really liked you. [Chuckles] 
 Yeah, that was an interesting meal, huh? 
 She thought you were  very  handsome. [Chuckles] 
 Yeah, well, your mother needs to get her eyes checked. 
 No, Charlie. 
 You are handsome. 
 Very much so. 
 So, uh... 
 Which one of these guys is your date? 
 He's not here yet. 
 Yeah? 
 Is this one of your regulars? 
 When he comes to town. 
 Yeah? And where's he from? 
 Nashville. 
 He staying at the hotel here? 
 Yeah, that's... that's why I'm here. 
 What's, he rich? 
 I'm not sure. 
 And what's he look like? 
 Sort of handsome, I guess. 
 Kind of average. 
 [Sighs] 
 So, uh, probably don't want to sit here and talk to me all night, right? 
 Maybe you should go. 
 Okay. 
 Um, so, what are you gonna do? 
 Go home to the kids? 
 Yeah. 
 Gonna finish my drink and then I'm gonna go. 
 It's always nice to see you. 
 Hey, Chelsea. 
 Hey, fortune. 
 How come you never called Helena? 
 She was asking me about you again. 
 I don't know, I-I think I'm gonna just stay independent for a little while. 
 It's gonna catch up to you, you know. 
 One of these assholes is gonna come mess you up worse than you got it the last time. 
 Remember how I got this? 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe I'll call her soon. 
 You should. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hi. How are you doing? 
 Hello. 
 Hey, pal, let me get another one. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm Chelsea. 
 Nice meeting you. 
 So, who's dead now? 
 Just went for a walk. 
 Clear my head. 
 Yeah? 
 Well, the sh1t's really hitting the fan, Rusty. 
 On top of that meeting they're having tonight, I just got word that that prick Muldoon stopped by the office, had a nice long talk with your father. 
 Any idea what about? 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 Might have something to do with the half dozen bodies you left lying around. 
 But my guess is the old man gave you up to that pig. 
 And that's all the more reason, Rusty, for you to do what I'm telling you you got to get out of town. 
 If Muldoon catches up to you, you're going back for a stretch. 
 Another stretch. A good one this time. 
 Sounds like you're trying to get rid of me, Uncle Red. 
 I'm trying to save your ass, Rusty. 
 Look, just let me keep an eye on things. 
 You go away for a little while, this all blows over, you come back. 
 Okay? 
 You'll keep an eye on things for me? 
 Of course. 
 You know, give it a month or so. 
 Go someplace warm. Get some sun. Jesus. 
 Take your girl, Kay, with you. 
 Call me in about a month. 
 Call me here and I'll let you know if it's safe to come back, okay? 
 Okay. 
 You tell me when. 
 [Sighs] 
 You didn't like it, did you? 
 [Chuckles] No, it was terrific. 
 But if I wted to spend four hours with a bunch of drunks, hookers, and degenerate gamblers, we could've just hit the bars over on 10th Avenue. 
 You're a real barrel of monkeys, you know that? 
 Yeah, but, uh, that's why you love me, right? 
 ♪ I love you ♪ 
 So, you make a wish? 
 Want to guess what it was? 
 I think I have a pretty good idea. 
 Don't think for a second you're out of the woods. 
 I'm still upset with you. 
 I know, I know. And I'm sorry. 
 I understand I haven't been the easiest to deal with the last couple weeks, but in my defense, I've been a little preoccupied with my Uncle's murder and my father's insistence that I help solve this thing. 
 Figured that's why your father paid us a visit this evening. 
 What? You didn't buy his B.S. 
 That he just missed his grandkids so much? 
 Look, I don't want to sound like an ingrate, ay this is all very nice. 
 The show, this beautiful dinner, the night at the hotel a few weeks ago, but I don't need any of this stuff. 
 I know you don't. 
 But like I just said, I have been a pain in the ass lately and I just wanted to make it up to you. 
 And it is your birthday, so we're allowed to splurge a little bit, right? 
 But I don't understand how you can have money for all this but we can't afford to move. 
 Unless there's another contract from work. 
 Well, to be perfectly honest, the tickets were on the arm, but the steaks and champagne, we're gonna have to pay for. 
 [Sighs] 
 Thank you. 
 So, uh... 
 Guess where I was this morning. 
 I thought you were working. 
 I lied. 
 Great. 
 So, where were you? 
 Bayside, Queens. 
 Went to go look at a little house for sale outhere. 
 You did not. 
 I did. 
 And I think we should go for it. 
 Are you serious? 
 So, am I out of the woods now? 
 Yeah. 
 Happy Birthday, baby. 
 Thank you.

 [Knocks "shave and a haircut" on door] 
 
 
 
 Whoa, hey, gorgeous. 
 Wow, you are looking a lot better than the last time I saw you. 
 You know, with the... 
 I'm only letting you in here because your sister needs to speak to you. 
 Don't give me a reason to change my mind. 
 Yeah, 'course, 'course, 'course. 
 My apologies. Where is she? 
 In the bedroom. 
 Land of missed opportunities. 
 Now is not the time. Go to her. 
 Okay. All right. Okay. All right. 
 Dee. What's go... whoa. What's going on? 
 What happened? 
 Somebody hurt you? 
 You... you tell me who it is right now, I'm gonna get a baseball bat, and I'm gonna bash their freaking head in. 
 No, it's not that. It's not that. 
 What is it? 
 Dee. 
 You're the only family I got. 
 So, please don't freak out on me when I tell you. 
 Dee, what the hell are you talking about? 
 You're scaring the sh1t out of me. 
 I'm pregnant. 
 Oh, wow. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Oh, wow. 
 It's Sean's, isn't it? 
 [Sighs] 
 You got any beer in the house? 
 It's in the fridge. 
 Yeah. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Get back in there. 
 I am going. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, look, Dee, I don't... 
 I don't know what you're planning to do with this baby. 
 You know, what y'rthinking. 
 But you should know last time I saw Sean, uh... 
 He was talking about you two getting married, going the whole nine. 
 You know, for what that's worth. 
 [Sobs] Oh, come here. 
 Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here. 
 [Breaking] I screwed up. 
 Yeah, what are... what are you doing? 
 I'm supposed to be the screw-up. 
 [Chuckles] You know? 
 [Crying] 
 Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. 
 Are you sure this is what you want to do? 
 You gave away an awful lot of good business today. 
 It's the only choice I have, Finbar. 
 You're the ones that are gonna have the problem. 
 Rusty and Thomas are not gonna take this lying down. 
 You kidding me? 
 We handled tougher guys than those two. 
 In the '20s and '30s, we had Legs, Cole, Madden, and their crews. 
 We took care of them. 
 We can take care of Rusty and Tommy. 
 We were a couple of hard cases, weren't we? 
 [Chuckles] 
 The hardest. 
 And what good did it do us? 
 We're still here. 
 We survived. 
 Survive. That's a hell of a thing to hang your hat on. 
 We survived. 
 Some of us didn't even do that. 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 [Screams] 
 You sure you want to do this, Monk? 
 Sure as I got a thought and a soul. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Thank you.

 Huh? 
 Well, you're a beauty no matter what he thinks. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Right this way, darlin'. Champagne's on ice. 
 God damn it. Where did I leave the key? 
 Ah, right here. 
 Hey, you have a good night, buddy. 
 There we go. 
 After you. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Cork pops] 
 [Giggling] 
 Hello, Mr. Muldoon. 
 What do you say, grandpa? 
 So, how were the kids? 
 Oh, they're sound asleep. They're a couple of angels. 
 Let me help you with that. 
 Thank you. 
 And they are very good listeners, especially after I threatened them with my cane. 
 Oh, fantastic. 
 All right, I'm gonna check on them, make sure they're still alive. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So... 
 Guess what. 
 Your meddling paid off. 
 I'm gonna buy the house in Queens, and we do not need your help. 
 Good for you. 
 Okay, brass tacks. 
 What about our investigation? 
 So, here's the deal. 
 Everything points to Rusty, but we can't prove it. 
 It also seems like he's responsible for this rash of killings all over the neighborhood. 
 What does Patton say about it? 
 [Sighs] I went to see him today. 
 Figured I'd try and reason with him. 
 Thought he would want to put an end to this as badly as we do. 
 I take it that didn't go very well. 
 No, it did not. 
 Just kind of gave me the runaround, so I had to tell him in no uncertain terms that we are done with him and his organization. 
 You were hoping he was gonna give up his own son. 
 Remember what I told you? Family's family. 
 I know. I know. 
 Because you know if it was anybody but Rusty who's responsible for these murders, Patton would've had a psycho like this whacked weeks ago and no one would be the wiser. 
 What are you gonna do about him? 
 I mean, you know, when all this started, I could give a sh1t who was responsible for killing Mr. O. 
 Really? Surprise, surprise. 
 But now that I know it's Rusty, I want to nail his ass. 
 Attago, Terry. 
 I was really starting to get worried that, uh... 
 That I had raised a pacifist. 
 All right, boys. Time to wrap it up. 
 It's funny, Monk. 
 Fathers, they always fantasized about... about leaving something for their sons, you know? 
 They build fortunes. They build saloons. 
 Businesses. [Scoffs] 
 I always felt that... 
 I just felt Rusty would come around, you know? 
 He'd... he'd get away from all this craziness and... start using his brains. 
 Never happened... he just got crazier and crazier and crazier. 
 You've always got Gerry. 
 No, no, no. 
 Gerry... Gerry was the smart one. 
 He got out when he was young. 
 Moved to California, the hell with this place. 
 He couldn't be persuaded to come back? 
 I don't want him to come back. 
 I want him out there. 
 His job now is taking care of her, taking care of Rosemary. 
 You know, she's the one that would really know what to do with all this. 
 [Laughs] 
 The smartest one of the bunch. 
 And tough, too. Jesus. 
 No, that's why I want her out there. 
 I want her in California. I want her to go to college. 
 I want her to have a decent life. 
 Not live in this sh1t with the rest of us. 
 Off to the airport, then? 
 Yeah. And go find Rusty. 
 God forgive me. 
 What a day. 
 Kill my brother and my son. 
 All right, let's go. 
 With pleasure, sir. 
 Ina! Did you hear about this? 
 Joe Patton was killed. 
 It says he and his driver were killed in a car bombing. 
 And his brother Thomas was killed in a separate shooting. 
 "While his older, more notorious brother Joseph Patton fell victim to an apparent mobster hit car explosion, Thomas 'Tommy Red' Patton, also alleged to have been a high-ranking officer within the Irish mob crime organization, was discovered murdered in the..." 
 Christine : "The streets of hell's kitchen run red with blood of the Irish mafia. At this time, detectives have no witnesses and no signicant physical evidence from either crime scene, according to a police spokesman. A neighborhood resident said, 'these murders will never get solved. People who witness a murder in hell's kitchen are smart enough to know you don't talk to the cops.'" 
 So, what do you think? Is that true? 
 Well, solving these cases isn't the issue. 
 It's convicting these assholes that's the problem. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Muldoon. 
 So, who was it? 
 I think you and I both know who it was. 
 All right, then what are you gonna do about it? 
 First I got to find this piece of sh1t. 
 Listen, if he's really the guy, there's no way he's still in the city. 
 H-he'd be long gone by now. 
 Yeah, you would think, but fortunately for us, Rusty Patton is not known for his smarts, is I will call you later today. 
 All right, babe. Sorry. I got to run, all right? 
 Okay. 
 Have a good day. 
 [Door closes] 
 Terry. Terry, wait a minute. 
 Terry. Wait a minute. 
 Look. 
 What is it? 
 I'm just... I'm worried. 
 Are you gonna be okay today? 
 Yeah, I'm gonna be fine. 
 Can you tell me where it is you're going? 
 Well, I got to go to the office, and then after that, I'm gonna stop in and see Kay. 
 Kay? Why Kay's? 
 I think she might know where Rusty is. 
 Just promise me you'll be careful, all right? 
 Yeah, babe, come here. Come here. 
 You got nothing to worry about, all right? 
 I'm gonna be fine. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 All right. 
 I'll see you later. 
 All right. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Hey, Stacy, how you doing? It's Charlie. 
 Oh, hey, Charlie. 
 What's going on? 
 Oh, nothing. I'm over here at work. 
 Listen, I, uh... I looked up Motherway and Kriegel. 
 It's on 48th and Madison. 
 But there's this, uh, gin mill around the corner. 
 It's called Matthews. 
 It's where all those pricks hang out. 
 I was wondering maybe we could meet for lunch and you could, uh, point this guy out to me. 
 Wait, wait. Hold on one second. 
 Shea, what are you doing? 
 I'm waiting for the captain. 
 Yeah? So what? Wait somewhere else. 
 No, thank you. 
 You want to, uh... you want to meet for lunch and you can, uh, point this guy out to me? 
 But he said he doesn't usually hang out with the guys from the office. 
 We got to assume everything these guys are telling you is a lie, Stace. 
 Okay. Um... 
 I'll... I'll see you there at 12:30. 
 Okay, I'll see you soon. 
 Hey, Bull! 
 [Whistles] 
 Hey, Bull. 
 Look, I was talking to tuuch. 
 There's some sh1t going on in the office you should know about. 
 Yeah? What's that? 
 Somebody's on the outs. 
 Oh, Vince told you that? 
 Yeah, and he said he has it under good authority. 
 He doesn't know whose head's gonna roll. 
 Johanson has his eyes set on one of us. 
 But you didn't hear that from me, all right? 
 Rusty, I'm scared... 
 That somebody might be coming after you next. 
 They killed Uncle red. They're gonna be coming after me. 
 Does anybody know about us? 
 No. Nobody. 
 What about your sister? 
 All she knows is that you called me. 
 Good. So no one would think to come looking for me here. 
 No. 
 What about Terry? 
 No, I didn't tell him anything, except, uh... except he suspects that I've been talking to you again. 
 What would make him think that? 
 I don't know, because people in the neighborhood tell him things. 
 All right, kay, listen to me. 
 If he comes here looking for me, you don't know sh1t, you got me? 
 Yes. 
 You haven't heard from me and you haven't seen me. 
 Can I trust you with that? 
 Yes, yes. 
 Okay, look, there's a couple things I need to get taken care of today, but... 
 I'm gonna need to leave town for a little while. 
 Listen. 
 I want you to come with me. 
 Will you do that for me? 
 Okay. 
 You will? 
 All right, get your stuff together. 
 We're gonna meet in three hours. 
 We're gonna leave from here. 
 Now, I don't want you talking to a soul between now and then. 
 Do you hear me? 
 Yes. 
 Listen. 
 I love you. 
 Not a soul. 
 Okay. 
 Three hours. 
 [Door closes] 
 Something wrong today, Charlie? 
 No. Why? 
 I don't know. You just seem a little on edge, a little distracted. 
 No, I'm all right. I just, uh... 
 Dealing with some bullshit at work, you know? 
 Are you in trouble or something? 
 No. Why would I be in trouble? 
 Maybe because of me. No. 
 No, I'm just, uh, helping out a friend, right? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Charlie, he's here. 
 Right over there. 
 Which one? 
 He's, uh, the one with the gray hair at... at the bar. 
 This old guy? 
 Yeah. 
 Why don't you just go smack the sh1t out of him and take the money yourself? 
 It's not funny. 
 He scared me. 
 This guy scared you? 
 So, what are we gonna do? 
 We? What, are we a team now? 
 Bonnie and Clyde? 
 I'm gonna deal with it, all right? 
 But you should get out of here. 
 I don't want him to see us together, all right? 
 Okay. 
 Call me later then? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 I'll see you later. 
 Bye. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Muldoon. 
 Hey, Terry, it's Bull. Uh, what are you doing? 
 Well, I'm trying to track down someone who might know where the hell Rusty Patton is. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm just grabbing some lunch. 
 Can I ask you a question real quick? 
 All right. What's on your mind? 
 Hey, uh, what's going on with Johanson? 
 I, uh... I heard a rumor he's looking to put somebody on the chopping block. 
 Where the hell did you hear that? 
 I, uh... I'd rather not say. 
 All right, Bull, look. 
 I don't know if it's you, but he did mention to me that he was not happy to hear that you were... messing around with some call girl. 
 And that's it? 
 That's all he said to me. 
 He wouldn't shitcan me over that, would he? 
 Hey, Bull, he's the boss. 
 He can do whatever the hell he wants. 
 All right. All right, Terry, I'll, uh... 
 I'll talk to you later. 
 All right, yeah. Charlie? 
 One other thing. 
 Are you still seeing that girl? 
 No. No, no, no. 
 I was, uh... I was never seeing her. 
 All right. 
 I'll talk to you later. 
 [Urinal flushes] 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Hey. Come on in. 
 So, how'd it go? 
 Uh, it's good. Everything, uh... everything's taken care of, all right? 
 I, uh... 
 I got the money he owed you. 
 Thank you. 
 Eh, you're welcome. 
 Make you a drink? 
 [Sighs] Sure. 
 So, I'm not working tonight. 
 Mm. Yeah? 
 I thought maybe you could stick around for a little while. 
 No. 
 I, uh... I don't think that's a good idea, Stacy. 
 Why not? 
 We'll just sit, talk, you know, get to know each other a little better. 
 Yeah. Listen, I, uh... 
 I can't do this. All right? 
 I, uh... I should go. 
 Wait a second. 
 Just sit with me for a second, please. 
 Uh, all right. 
 Thank you. 
 Look, Charlie. 
 I understand. 
 You shouldn't have to... to do this for me anymore. 
 I know you can get in trouble at work, and I don't want that. 
 Yeah. 
 And I was thinking, you know, if we don't have this relationship, an arrangement, maybe we can have something more. 
 What are you talking about, huh? 
 Something more? 
 Huh? 
 Something real. 
 Come on, I... 
 I know you've thought about it, too. 
 No, I-I can't do this, okay? 
 I can't do this with you, you understand? I'm a cop. 
 Why does that matter? [Groans] 
 I'm a cop, all right? I got a family, and you... 
 I know. I know you do. 
 No, you... you're... you... 
 I'm a whore. 
 Yeah. 
 Look, I'm... I'm sorry, okay? 
 You're an asshole, you know that?!
