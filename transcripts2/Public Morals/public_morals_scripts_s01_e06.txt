 You thought you could hide this from us, huh? 
 I found it stuffed in the garbage in the bathroom. 
 You know what? Do you... do you want a beer? 
 'Cause I'll go get you a beer. Because by the looks of this, you must've been drunk all semester. 
 I just can't believe that you are okay with this being representative of you. 
 This report card tells the world who you are and what you're capable of. 
 It's not that bad. 
 It's not that bad? 
 So you're comfortable with these grades? 
 I did the best that I could. The best you could? 
 Let's see, we got four Cs, a D, and an F. That's your best? 
 Classes were much harder this year. 
 Well, class is hard when you're not paying attention to the teacher all day long, 'cause you're too busy acting like a jerk-off! 
 But you know what? If you're okay being a dummy in addition to being the class clown, be my guest. 
 Go hang out on the street corner, get drunk with all the other dopes, and hopefully, I won't be there on the night you get locked up. 
 Oh, yeah, and another thing... you can kiss those Knick tickets goodbye. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 James, we shouldn't have to ride you to do your homework and study for your tests. 
 You should want to do it on your own. 
 You should want to get a report card with straight As. 
 We know you're capable of it. You've done it before. 
 He's too tough on me, Mom, and you know it. 
 I know that he's tough on you, but this is different. 
 And even I'm not gonna let you get away with this. 
 An F in religion. Great, thanks. 
 Now I'm gonna have to hear from Sister Paul. 
 Muldoon : So what's this I hear you're helping out with some prostitute? 
 Oh, where'd you hear that? 
 From Johanson. 
 Although he did not tell me who this handsome devil is. 
 Yeah, that's funny. 
 Nah, it's just... you remember the, uh, blond, the schoolteacher we grabbed a few weeks ago? 
 Yeah, yeah, I figured it might be her. 
 Yeah, I just told her, you know, if she ever needed any help to give me a call, that's it. 
 But what on earth would ever possess you do to that, Bull? 
 Unless, of course, you're looking to jump into the sack with her... 
 No. 
 Which I pray to God you are not. 
 No, no, no, it's not like that. 
 I just... I felt bad for her. 
 You felt bad for her? Now I feel bad for you. 
 Tony B.! 
 Ha! And here I thought I was done with these mad dog Irishmen. 
 What do you say? 
 Hey, Terry. 
 Bull, thanks for coming down. 
 Tony. 
 You must've pissed somebody off in a past life, my friend. 
 Yeah, well, payback's a bitch. 
 [Laughs] 
 Curtis, could you uncover him, please? 
 Yes, Sir. 
 Look, Terry, Bull, I figured you might know this hump, huh? 
 We found him on the West Side. 
 Look who it is. Jim Sullivan. 
 I must've collared this mutt 20 times. 
 Yeah, he was part of my uncle's crew. 
 Smitty's right hand, too. 
 Yeah, well, we found him in the passenger seat of Smitty's brand-new Cadillac. 
 Apparently, the poor b*st*rd just bought it that day. 
 Yeah. And what about Smitty? 
 Nah, nah, nah, he's nowhere to be found. 
 But, but... His car was parked across the street from Walker's tavern. 
 Oh, that's Bob Davis' place. 
 Yeah, that's a Patton spot. 
 They got a weekly card game going back for 20 years. 
 Yeah, well, Davis was a no-show at work today, and his bartender, of course, he knows nothing. 
 That figures. I know where Davis lives, though. 
 We'll pay him a visit after we get out of here. 
 Hey, you got any idea about, uh, Smitty's whereabouts, Tony? 
 Look, the way I figure it, he gets out of his car to meet someone, maybe on the corner. 
 Most likely inside Walker's tavern. 
 He comes out, sees this guy get shot in the head, and he takes off. 
 Yeah, maybe payback for that double homicide last week. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I mean, what do you think, Terry? 
 I mean, you know these mopes better than me. 
 Look, it's hard to know where the lines are drawn with these psychos, or who the allegiances are with. 
 It could be retaliation for Rogers and O'Reilly or it could be the same guys who whacked 'em. 
 Yeah, you never friggin' know. 
 And all these skells work for Patton's operation, including your uncle. 
 So what are you saying? 
 It's somebody from the outside lookin' to take 'em out? 
 Maybe somebody from the inside. 
 Yeah, maybe Smitty. 
 Nah, Smitty's gone. 
 We're not gonna hear from him again. 
 Huh. 
 Somebody inside Patton's organization, if not Patton himself. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Lookin' for the Big Guy. 
 [Scoffs] The Big Guy? 
 No, there's nobody here by that name. 
 Isn't this Joseph Patton's number? 
 Yes, it is. 
 Then who am I speaking with? 
 His granddaughter Rosemary. 
 [Chuckles] Oh, Rosemary. 
 You probably don't remember me, but I knew you when you were just a little girl. 
 I knew your father, too. 
 Wish I could say the same. 
 Apple doesn't fall far, I see. 
 Please let your grandfather know that Mike Muldoon is on the phone. 
 Hold on a second. 
 Grandpa? 
 It's Mike Muldoon. 
 Well, there's a hell of a beginning to the day. 
 [Sucks teeth] Give it. 
 Sergeant Mike, how the hell are ya? 
 I was wondering if you'd be available for that drink we discussed. 
 Do you know, Mike, I think today might be a perfect day for that drink. 
 Where do you hang your hat these days? 
 We're up in Woodlawn, but I'd gladly come down into the city. 
 No, no, no, Jesus, don't stir yourself. 
 No, it'll be nice to have a-a bit of a day in the country. 
 Okay, Big Guy, grab a pencil. I'll give you the address. 
 You know, that thing that we were talking about earlier, I just want you to know, it ain't that big a deal. 
 Yeah, what's that? 
 The thing, the girl. 
 [Chuckles] You mean, the Hooker? 
 Yeah, just... you don't have to worry about it. 
 Look, if you're not banging this broad, then I'm not worrying. It's right here. 
 You know, my mother she breaks my balls enough, you know that? 
 So you're trying to tell me that you're not banging her? 
 No. 
 But you want to. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 You don't wanna bang her? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Who is it? 
 Hey, Davis, it's Terry Muldoon. Open up. 
 Yeah, sure, Terry, hang on a second. 
 Open the goddamn door! 
 I'm comin'. 
 Muldoon : Hey, asshole, let's go! 
 Yeah, here goes. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Grunts, breathing heavily] 
 Jesus Christ! Are you all right? 
 I'm good. Go get that son of a bitch! 
 [Groans loudly] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Gunshots] 
 You're a dead man, Davis! 
 [Panting] 
 sh1t! 
 Did you get him?! 
 No, he's gone. 
 What about you? You all right? 
 I'm good. 
 Go see if that hump's got a bottle of whiskey, will ya? 
 Yeah, all right. 
 Let me see what he's got, you crazy... son of a bitch! 
 [Dog barking] 
 How long you been out here, Michael? 
 About 20 years. 
 Ina was done with the city. 
 Well, the city's changed since we were kids. 
 It keeps right on changing. 
 All the money you got, and you never bought yourself a country house? 
 I was terrified I'd leave the neighborhood for 15 minutes, the vultures would snatch it away from me. 
 I never even took a vacation. 
 Not even with Ruth? 
 No, she was desperate to go back to the old country for a bit. 
 I never gave it to her. God forgive me. 
 Well, you're not dead yet, Big Guy, you know? 
 You ought to treat yourself before the ride is over. 
 [Coughs, inhales] You ever wonder what your life would've been like if you'd done something completely different? 
 No, I always loved the job. 
 You know what I really wanted to do? 
 Enlighten me. 
 I wanted to be an actor. 
 An actor? 
 The great big red Patton... 
 [Laughs] 
 Secretly dreamed of being George M. Cohan? 
 Yeah, that's... that's why I let my middle boy, Gerry... do you remember Gerry? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 He wanted to pursue his dream in California, and I encouraged him. 
 I didn't wanna be like my old man, who beat my dream out of me. 
 Jesus, listen to me, will ya? 
 I'm like some old woman rattling her beads and moaning about her life. 
 God. 
 We all get sentimental in our old age. 
 Now that you've indulged me and all my bullshit about old times, why am I here? 
 I need to find my brother-in-law John's killer. 
 Why do you think I can help you? 
 Don't jerk me around here after we've had such a nice chat. 
 I know nothing is more important to you than your family. 
 And the same thing is true of me. 
 And I also know if someone did any harm to anybody in your family, you would exact justice. 
 Well, that, too, is true of me. 
 Now I want a name. 
 I can do this for you. 
 First of all, I promise you, man to man, I had nothing to do with this. 
 And as far as I know, no one in my organization had anything to do with this. 
 Having said that, I will place the word among my people that I want an answer here, I want a name. 
 And when I get it, if I get it, you'll be the first call I make. 
 How's that? 
 That sounds like bullshit. 
 But I don't know if I should've expected anything different from you. 
 Michael, you have a nice life out here. 
 You're an old man, you're a retired man. 
 Why don't you just enjoy your life out here and leave all that shite in the city where it belongs? 
 Mommy, look at this! 
 Wow. That seat better be down. 
 That's great, honey. Go wash your hands before lunch, okay?

 Michael, can you turn off that music and finish your homework, please?

 [Ring] 
 Hello? 
 Yes. 
 What? 
 Oh, my God. Is he okay? 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Did he say what time he's comin' home? 
 All right, well, thanks for calling, Mr. Ferrell.

 Sure.

 What do you want me to say? 
 Rusty said I gotta sit on it for now. 
 What the hell am I supposed to do in the meantime, you prick? 
 You go out to Brooklyn, you get something going with the Dolans', right? 
 But I can't be involved in any sh1t like that right now. 
 I got too many eyes on me, including this cute little blonde at the end of the bar. 
 Hey. Ha ha. 
 Hey, listen, if I was you, I'd stay close to Rusty.

 Oh, you do remember.

 Look at that, look at that. 
 What are you guys doing in this neighborhood? 
 We just saw an off-Broadway play at the theater down the block. 
 Oh, yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah? That the only reason? 
 What other reason might there be? 
 I don't know. Maybe you're looking for a little danger? 
 A little walk on the wild side? 
 Oh, is someone dangerous here? 
 [Lowered voice] Yeah, you're looking at him. 
 You don't look that tough. 
 Ah, I might surprise you. 
 [Women laugh] 
 You wanna really surprise me? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Let me see you dance. 
 You wanna see me dance? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You wanna see me dance? 
 Uh-huh. 
 All right, I would be more than happy to, sweetheart. 
 But I gotta warn you, I'm a goddamn regular Gene Kelly. 
 Oh! 
 So you better try to keep up. 
 [Gasps] Yeah! 
 You ready? 
 I'm ready. 
 I don't think you're ready. 
 I was born ready. 
 Yeah? Maybe you are ready. 
 Told you. 
 But are you ready for this? 
 Ooh! Whoo!

 Dad? 
 He's okay. He's just a little groggy. 
 [Mumbles] I came right from work. 
 I... I don't know what we would do if we lost you. [Cries] 
 [Weakly] No, I'm... I'm okay. 
 [Kisses] You're in my soul, though. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Muttering] 
 Yeah, told you I was a good dancer. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, where you from, beautiful? 
 Greenwich, Connecticut. 
 Never heard of it. It's a nice town? 
 [Laughs] Yes, very. 
 I bet you come from a sh1t load of money. 
 [Gasps, laughs] 
 What's your father do? 
 He's the vice president at an insurance company. 
 Yeah, see, see, see, I told you. 
 Dee ever tell you what our father did? 
 No, she said he died when she was young. 
 Yeah, he didn't just die. 
 He got thrown off a roof a couple of blocks from here. 
 Oh, my God, why? 
 He said the wrong thing to the wrong guy. 
 And for that he got tossed off a roof? 
 Yeah, like I told you, it's a rough neighborhood, which is why I better get you home before you get into any trouble. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Laughing] 
 I have a feeling if I let you, I might end up in even worse trouble. 
 Yeah, that is a distinct possibility. 
 [Laughs] It might be kind of funny if Dee came home... 
 What? 
 And found you in my bed. 
 What? Why? 
 Might be just what she deserves. 
 What did she do to you? 
 I came home and found her and your buddy... 
 Yeah? 
 Going at it on the kitchen table. 
 Wait, what buddy? Who buddy? Where buddy? 
 Sean, the cop. 
 Whoa, is that a fact? 
 [Scoffs] Right there on the table. 
 Well, maybe she needs a dose of her own medicine, right? 
 [Horns honking in distinct] 
 [Sirens wail in distance]

 [Indistinct conversations, laughter] 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, what are you doin' out here? 
 Oh, my God. 
 All right, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. 
 Come here, come here. I'm all right. 
 Are you okay? 
 I am all right. 
 [Sniffles] And Charlie? 
 Charlie's fine. 
 He's in the hospital, but it's nothing serious. 
 Okay? What about the kids? 
 I-I sent them to Gilroys'. I... they're fine. 
 They don't know a thing. 
 All right, all right. 
 Come on. Let's get you inside. 
 No, you had me so scared, Terry. I... 
 I know, I know, it's okay. It's okay, I'm home. 
 Okay. 
 All right? Come on, let's get you in. 
 [Horn honks in distance] 
 So, what's this I hear you're hanging around with that shanty Irish Duffy girl? 
 Where'd you hear that? 
 The walls in Hell's Kitchen have ears. 
 Well, Ma, let me tell you this, she's a nice girl. 
 She's not like these other neighborhood broads. 
 I find that hard to believe, given her parents. 
 Well, given who my father was, you could say the same of me. 
 What do you think happened to him, Sean? 
 You must've heard something. 
 Ma, I haven't heard anything, 'cause everyone knows not to bring up his name in front of me. 
 Your turn. 
 [Lock clicks] 
 [Television playing] 
 How'd you get in here? 
 I told you I was irresistible. 
 Your roommate invited me over. 
 Barbara? No, she did not. 
 Look on the couch. 
 [Man speaks indistinctly on television] 
 [Television turns off] 
 Oh, God, Patrick, you did not. 
 Yes, we did. We had a very lovely night... before she upchucked in the bathroom. 
 Look at her face. 
 Yeah, I know. You might want to clean that up, too. 
 How could you do this? 
 Payback's a bitch. 
 Meaning what? 
 I might not be the smart one in the family, but I'm not an idiot. 
 What does that mean? 
 Ask Sean. 
 [Lock clicks] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Guess who? 
 Rusty. 
 I missed you, Kay. 
 I've missed you, too. 
 Yeah? 
 So what are we gonna do about it? 
 I thought you said you were gonna stop by. 
 Why do you think I'm callin'? How's tomorrow look? 
 No, tomorrow's no good. I got my family comin' over. 
 Sunday dinner. 
 Does that include that dick-wad Terry Muldoon? 
 And his father. 
 Lucky you. How 'bout Monday? 
 I'll be home all mornin'. 
 Well, I guess I'll see you then. 
 Okay. 
 Doesn't make any sense. 
 Bob Davis seemed like such a nice man. 
 Why would he do something like that? 
 Thank you. 
 Because Bob was hardly a prince, all right? 
 [Opens can] 
 He'd been locked up a couple times for armed robbery and once even put his brother-in-law in the hospital over a $10 bet. 
 So, please, do not cry any tears for Bob, all right? 
 And he's just out there on the loose? 
 If he's smart, he's already a long way out of New York. 
 Why? What are they gonna do? 
 Are they gonna kill him if they find him? 
 Without a second thought. 
 Why not just arrest him? 
 'Cause it's not an option. 
 Why not? 
 Because he already proved he has no problem trying to kill a cop. 
 And you do not wanna give a guy like that a second chance to succeed. 
 There's our hero. How are you holding up, Bull? 
 I'm good, I'm fine. 
 What do you say, Mrs. Bullman? 
 I just got a little bit of a hangover, but I'm all right. 
 Yeah, but you're gonna live, right? 
 Yeah, it was nothing. 
 I'll be back on the basketball court beating you up in a week. 
 [Laughs] 
 What's she going on about? 
 Nah, she's just very proud of me, right, Ma? 
 Yeah, well, as well she should. 
 So what's the deal? How long they gonna keep you in here? 
 A few more days. I'll be back on the job in no time. 
 She thinks I'm being a big baby. 
 She wants me to go back to work immediately, right, Mom? 
 Okay, Mom. Mom, please. Please. 
 You're making me crazy, all right? 
 Go get yourself a tea so I can talk to Terry alone for a second. 
 I gotta talk to those uniforms outside so they don't let her back in here. 
 She's making me crazy. 
 [Door closes] 
 So, how you really doin'? 
 I'm all right. 
 Can you believe that son of a bitch opened up on us like that? 
 All I'm thinking about is what would happen to my family. 
 What if I wasn't there to walk my little girl down the aisle? 
 Well, look, I don't want you to worry about that, all right? 
 We've got every cop in the city looking for this prick. 
 He's dumb enough to stay in New York, he doesn't survive the night. 
 Officer! Officer! 
 [Distant whistling] 
 He's over here. He's right over here. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 [Sirens wailing in distance] 
 He's right here, he's right here. 
 Ah. 
 Seany, Seany, Seany, we gotta talk. 
 We got things we gotta discuss. 
 Hey, Duff, long time. 
 What the hell are you doing here bright and early? 
 You lied to me, Beantown. 
 Yeah, well, you know, now that makes two of us. 
 I thought I told you not to go near my sister. 
 What do you want me to say? I like her. 
 Yeah, I like her, too, which is why I don't want you going anywhere near her. 
 I don't understand this. What's your problem with me dating your sister? 
 Look, if I knew you to be anything other than an animal with the ladies, anything other than a playboy, I wouldn't have a problem with it. 
 You're my oldest friend, you're a good guy, you're a pig when it comes to the pussy. 
 I don't want my sister getting hurt. 
 Look, it's not like that with her. 
 Oh, meaning what? You're gonna get serious all of a sudden? 
 You're gonna put a ring on her finger? 
 You're getting married. 
 That's what you're telling me. 
 Now, look, we've only seen each other a couple of times, but yeah, the thought has crossed my mind. 
 Come on, Sean! Come on, what? You change overnight? 
 Your father dies, all of a sudden you're getting sentimental... marriage, kids, the whole nine? 
 You're gonna move out to the 'burbs? 
 You're gonna get a nice little house? 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 Yeah. 
 Why not? 
 You don't know sh1t about my sister then, do you? 
 
 
 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 [Coins clink, dialing] 
 Hey, Tony B., it's Muldoon. What's the word? 
 Hey, Irish, what's up? 
 Well, I just left Bullman at the hospital. 
 One of the unis told me they found Smitty's body. 
 Yeah, yeah, a bunch of kids found him on an alley on 51st Street. 
 Thank God it wasn't my kids. 
 Otherwise the wife would've had us packed up and in the moving truck on our way to Suffolk county by now. 
 [Chuckles] Listen, so how's Bullman doin'? 
 I just haven't had a chance to get over there yet. 
 He's gonna be fine. 
 He caught a little shrapnel to the shoulder, but at least the good news is we know that Davis was involved. 
 Well, you got any ideas where he's hidin'? 
 Nothing yet. I'm working on it. 
 What about you? You got anything on your end? 
 I went back to question some of the hookers who troll near Arthur's. 
 Yeah, of course you did. 
 What did they give you other than the clap? 
 You Mick b*st*rd. 
 Look, Ter, I got the name of that hooker who was hanging out in the bar that night. 
 She goes by the name of Ruby. 
 They said they never saw her in there before. 
 Ter, she looks a little more high-end than the other girls that Mr. O usually hangs out with. 
 High-class hooker, huh? 
 You're gonna have a field day hunting that one down. 
 What's your plan? 
 You're gonna head up to Central Park South tonight? 
 Canvass the area? See if you get lucky? 
 Now that you mention it, maybe I will go up to the Oak Room and have a drink. 
 If you could square with the warden, you care to tag along? 
 Hey, Tony B., I wish I could, but I got a family obligation tonight. 
 I'm sorry to miss it. 
 But you call me if you get lucky. 
 Say hi to the missus for me. 
 Yeah, you got it. 
 I just don't understand how you could do it. It's Patrick. 
 He's such a squirrely little sh1t. 
 I don't understand why you're so upset. 
 Nothing happened. 
 Yeah, nothing happened because you were so drunk and sick nothing could happen. That's the only reason. 
 Okay, I'm sorry. But, in my defense, like you said, I was pretty drunk. 
 [Both laugh] 
 And you know, he is a pretty good dancer. 
 No, stop it. I don't... I do not wanna hear that. 
 Okay, so I don't have to worry about this, right? 
 This is not the beginning of some great epic romance? 
 Oh, please, God, no. 
 No offense, but I've set my sights a little bit higher. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 And so should you. 
 What does that mean? We're not talking about me. 
 Nothing, I just... you know, I've seen that boy Sean look at you, and he's falling in love. 
 He's not falling in love. We're hanging out. That's it. 
 [Laughs] You can keep telling yourself that, but you should know that my friend Don from college... 
 The one in publishing? 
 Uh-huh. 
 He's driving down from Connecticut tonight and he wants to see you. 
 So if I were you, I'd maybe take him up on it. 
 I'll consider it. 
 He's pretty cute. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Jonesy, round of drinks over here. 
 Hey, Boss. 
 How'd it go, Lieutenant? How's Bullman holding up? 
 He got lucky. He and Muldoon both did. 
 You get a chance to meet that crazy mother of his? 
 Come on, when she had me out in the hallway for 20 minutes, I did not understand a single word she said. 
 Oh, forget his mother. Did you see his daughter Agnes? 
 Holy sh1t, how in the hell did a fox like that come from a lummox like Bull? 
 Hey, you're talking about a man's daughter here, fool. 
 Better watch your ass, McGuinness. 
 Bullman finds out you're talking about his daughter like that, you're gonna be the one in the hospital. 
 I was just...  
 Hey, that's enough. 
 That's enough. I just wanna know what you guys are doing to catch the shooter. 
 I went to every one of my stoolies. 
 They all know as soon as they hear something, they better come to me right away or it's their asses. 
 And you? 
 Same deal, Boss.

 [Blows raspberry] 
 What the hell were you thinking talking like that in front of him? 
 What? I thought we were all playing around. 
 No, no, no, no, you play around with me. 
 You don't play around with the bosses. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 [Exhales] 
 You're right, you're right. 
 [Horn honks in distance] 
 Hello. 
 [Lowered voice] All right, so, where the hell is Davis? 
 [Lowered voice] Terry, I got no love for that prick, but come on. 
 Anybody sees me talking to you, they're coming after me. 
 Listen to me. This is not regular business. 
 This is the real deal. 
 I need to know where that son of a bitch is, you got me? 
 You're the only guy I'd take this chance for. 
 But if it gets out, I'm dead. 
 Yeah, and you would be rotting in a jail cell right now if not for me. 
 All right, I'll find him for you. 
 When you do, call the office. 
 [Paper rustles] 
 [Taps bar] 
 They'll know where to find me. 
 [Horn blares in distance] 
 How you think he got wind of us? 
 Ugh, my roommate Barbara, who swears she couldn't stand the guy, got drunk and took him home. 
 She must be an absolutely desperate chick. 
 Yeah, and she says she did it to get back at me. 
 About what? 
 What do you think? 
 Oh, the kitchen table? 
 Yeah, the kitchen table. 
 Come on, it wasn't even that bad. 
 Oh, I'm pretty sure that set her off good. 
 And, of course, my brother is furious at both of us for not obeying his wishes. 
 Yeah, well, I had a little talk with him about you and me. 
 And actually, I think he's gonna be okay with us. 
 Oh. Well, I don't believe that for a second, but more importantly, I don't need his permission or his approval, Sean. 
 What did you two talk about exactly? 
 You know, just how I feel about you. 
 Oh, boy. 
 Why am I scared to hear this? 
 Why would you be scared? 
 I just think we have different expectations, that's all. 
 How so? 
 About what this could be. 
 Hey, I think this could be something serious. 
 I do. 
 Sean. 
 I think you're a great guy, but there's a lot I want to do with my life before I wanna get serious with anybody. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 So then, uh, I take it dinner at my mom's place... 
 [Laughing] 
 With my family for Sunday dinner is out. 
 [Laughing] Yeah, I think I'll pass on that. 
 Yeah. 
 But, you know, you give her my best. 
 I can call you? 
 Absolutely. 
 Just don't run out and buy a ring, all right? 
 So how long are you gonna keep that roast in the oven? 
 The roast is fine. 
 It's gonna be like shoe leather. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Muldoon : Somebody answer the door. 
 Don't worry about the roast. 
 It's got 20 minutes. 
 Hi! 
 [Laughing] Hi, sweetie. 
 Look who's here. 
 Look who's here. 
 Hey, grandma. 
 Go put your coats in there. 
 Hi, grandma. 
 It's so good to see ya. 
 How are you? 
 So good to see ya. 
 Nice to see you. 
 Just put your coats in the back. 
 How's it going in here? 
 We're doing fine. We're doing fine. 
 Come in now. 
 Yeah, you're getting too tall. 
 Stop it, stop... stop growing. 
 Nice to see you. 
 Hi, Christine. 
 Mwah! 
 How's Charlie? 
 Charlie is gonna be fine, thank God. 
 He gets out of the hospital in a couple of days. 
 Can you believe what happened? 
 I swear, it's like everyone in this city has gone crazy. 
 Don't kid yourself. They were all crazy when I moved here as a little girl. 
 And the craziest little lass was yourself. 
 I don't remember you complainin'. 
 [Laughs] 
 But unlike these two, we had the good sense to move out. 
 No, don't include me in that. I'm ready to go. 
 And not just the neighborhood, I want out of the city. 
 So what's preventing you two from moving out? 
 Well, speak to your son about it. 
 He loves the neighborhood too much. 
 And why wouldn't you? 
 Such a nice place to raise your kids. 
 Another murder every other night. 
 Let's not get into this again, okay? 
 Well, it's true. 
 You know, even Joseph Patton, who happened to visit me this... this weekend up at the house, expressed his regret at never moving out of the city. 
 And what exactly was Joe Patton doing up at the house? 
 Just because you've given up on this investigation doesn't mean I have. 
 Hmm, and what'd you get out of him, sarge, huh? 
 What'd you find out? 
 I think he knows who did it. 
 He's just not saying. 
 Of course he's not saying. What'd you really think? 
 He was gonna volunteer that information? 
 Well, I thought I would appeal to the family man in him. 
 Yeah, and I thought I talked to you about leaving this alone, didn't I? 
 That's enough bullshit now. 
 Take this out of the kitchen so we can finish making dinner. 
 Terrance, can I speak to you privately for a minute? 
 Yes, with pleasure. 
 You, too. Go! I'm not movin'. 
 We're making you a nice meal. 
 So I heard about Jim Sullivan and now Smitty, too? 
 They both worked for John, so it's gotta be connected, right? 
 So it would seem, yeah. 
 And we know that Bob Davis was involved so as soon as we find him, we hopefully will know more. 
 That's it? What's all you got? 
 Kay, come on, you know this neighborhood. 
 Nobody's talkin' to us. 
 Well, I know some people. Maybe I'll ask around. 
 You really sure you wanna go down that road? 
 He's a friend. It'll be fine. 
 Kind of crazy, this whole Bullman sh1t, right? 
 Oh, yeah? What's so crazy about it? 
 Him getting shot like that. 
 He's a cop. Sometimes we get shot. 
 Yeah, I know, but that's one of the reasons I wanted to join clothes. 
 I didn't wanna get my ass shot off. 
 Leave that for the cowboys. 
 How did you get in, anyway? What was your hook? 
 My uncle Billy was a bookmaker up in inwood. 
 His best friend worked for public morals up there. 
 What about you? 
 Had a Dutch uncle down at headquarters who looks out for me. 
 Oh, yeah? Who was that? 
 He looks out for me because I know how to keep my mouth shut which is something you still need to learn how to do. 
 Capisce? 
 Capisce. 
 Terry, you're being unfair. Let the kid go. 
 These are incredible seats... third row, center court. 
 Yeah, come on, Dad, you're being unfair. 
 After that report card, you're lucky you can still walk. 
 Don't you think you're being too tough on him, Terrance? 
 I don't remember you being any great student. 
 Oh, yeah, well, I was never as smart as he was. 
 With his brains, there should be nothing but straight Aâs on that report card, and it's not just his grades that are getting him into trouble, is it? 
 You trying to tell me that you weren't drinking at his age? 
 Yeah, I did, thanks to you, but I shouldn't have. 
 James? James! 
 Have you learned your lesson? 
 Yeah. 
 See? You're not gonna let him go 'cause of that? 
 No, I am not, and that is the end of it. 
 You, go sit down and finish your dinner. 
 You're being ridiculous, Terrance. Just let the boy go. 
 What kind of lesson are you trying to teach him? 
 Thank you, Kay. 
 The lesson is clear. 
 If you do not work hard, you do not get rewards. 
 This from a man who barely finished high school. 
 You're too strict, Terrance. You're worse than himself was. 
 Yeah, and Terry complains all the time about how tough you were, Pop. 
 And now you're just as guilty as your father was. 
 You know what? As much as my father was a complete and total pain in the ass, that toughness did pay off, so... 
 Says you. 
 Yeah. 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 Oh, Terrance, can you get that for me? 
 So where'd you get the tickets? 
 Oh, got 'em from this Booker out in queens. 
 Hello? 
 Who's that? 
 Tony from 49th street. 
 Really? Yeah, what did he say? 
 Right, yeah, give me an address. 
 It was bad, but he should still be able to go. 
 He got a couple of Câs. It's fine. 
 Sean. 
 Grab your sh1t. We gotta take care of something. 
 Where are you going? But we're not finished with dinner. 
 I gotta take care of something and it doesn't concern you. 
 Where you going? 
 Mike : We're in the middle of dinner, you know. 
 We'll call you later. 
 It's just... it's a little something we gotta take care of. 
 It's not a big deal, all right? Don't worry. 
 You know, you're leaving right in the middle of dinner, and your mother slaved over a hot stove! 
 Kay, thanks for dinner. It was delicious. 
 She didn't do sh1t. I cooked. 
 Unbelievable. 
 I mean, she helped. 
 So what's going on? 
 I just got a tip on where that prick Bob Davis is hiding out. 
 Oh, sh1t. So what are we gonna do? 
 What are we gonna do? 
 That asshole tried to kill me and Bullman, so when you see him, aim for his head. 
 Hold up. We're gonna kill Bob Davis? 
 You got a better idea?

 [Gears shift, engine turns off] 
 [Indistinct conversations, shouting in distance] 
 All right, you check the front. I got back here. 
 You good? 
 Yeah. 
 [Lock thuds] 
 How we looking down there, Sean? 
 This first room's clear, Terry. 
 [Screams] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Hold it right there, Davis! 
 Muldoon, I just wanna get out of here without getting hurt. 
 Too late for that, asshole. Sean, shoot this prick! 
 All right, Davis, don't do anything stupid, and nobody's gonna get hurt, okay? 
 Nobody needs to get shot. 
 Sean, shoot this son of a bitch right now! 
 You gotta drop those freaking guns or I will shoot you! 
 Nobody needs to get shot. 
 All I wanna do is get out of here, so you back off! 
 Drop those freaking guns, Davis! 
 What the hell are you waiting for?! 
 Shut the hell up! 
 Come on, Davis. 
 Sean! 
 Listen, you're gonna drop that gun and let me out or one of you's getting shot. 
 Don't do anything stupid. You're not gonna shoot a cop. 
 Shoot this son of a bitch! 
 Davis, I don't wanna shoot you. 
 Now drop those freaking guns! 
 Pull the goddamn trigger! 
 Terry... 
 Sean, shoot him! 
 [Gun clatters, dog barking in distance] 
 [Davis wheezing] 
 Jesus Christ, what the hell were you waiting for?! 
 You could've got both of us shot, you stupid son of a bitch! 
 I thought he was gonna drop the guns. 
 Do me a favor... next time, you think on your time, not on mine! 
 Is he dead? 
 I don't know. Let me check. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Thud] 
 Yeah, he's dead. 
 [Sirens wailing in distance] 
 Michael, we're not waiting another second. Move it. 
 I'm coming. 
 Yeah, Chris, wait a second. 
 I'm gonna walk my grandkids home. 
 Let's go. 
 James, let's go. 
 Right now, I'll be back in a few. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, there you go. 
 Take the cookie, let's go. 
 [Chuckles] 
 See you, grandma. See you, aunt Kay. 
 Kay : Bye, boys. 
 What do you, grow up in a goddamn barn? 
 Why don't you close the door? 
 [Door creaks] 
 It was a very nice dinner, Kay. Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 So, I received a phone call from Rusty Patton the other day. 
 You did? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What'd he want? 
 He was just being friendly, checking in on me. 
 'Cause he's such a gentleman. 
 I know you've never liked him, Ina, but just because you don't know him. 
 Nor do I ever want to. 
 And if you were wise, you would stay away from him, Kay. 
 It doesn't look right. People will talk. 
 Well, there's nothin' to talk about. 
 It was just a phone call. 
 Well, knowing you, it won't end there. 
 [Whispers] You two better be quiet. 
 I don't want her waking up. 
 [Door squeaks] 
 Finally. 
 [Lowered voice] Is she asleep? 
 Yeah. 
 You really didn't need to wait. 
 Oh, no, it's fine. 
 I wanted to talk anyhow. 
 Hmm? 
 Were you serious earlier about looking to move out of here? 
 I know. It seems crazy, right? 
 Why would I ever wanna leave this luxurious apartment? 
 You want out? 
 Yeah. 
 Go find yourself a house. Maybe somewhere up near us. 
 I'll have Ina do a little research, see what's available. 
 We got plenty of great school districts. 
 We've got lots of parks, no murders. 
 Sounds lovely, but Terry says we can't afford it. 
 Terry's full of sh1t. He always has been. 
 So I'll tell you what we're gonna do. 
 Me and Ina, we'll help you with the down payment. 
 I appreciate that, Pop, but Terry would never go for that. 
 You just find the house. 
 I'll take care of the husband, all right? 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Was this mutt really armed? 
 Looks like a good shooting, Lieutenant. 
 Five shots in the chest, D.O.A. 
 Hey, Sean, not so fast. 
 You know you nearly got us killed in there, right? 
 I know. 
 Do you? Because I don't know that you do. 
 You cannot hesitate. 
 There is no room for indecisiveness. 
 You hesitate, and one of us gets killed. You got me? 
 Yeah. 
 You better, because we got lucky this time. 
 Next time, you pull the goddamn trigger and you shoot that son of a bitch, all right? 
 Yeah, I said I got ya. 
 Hey, this is for your own goddamn good. 
 You need to remove the part of your brain that questions things and just do it. 
 Now smarten up. 
 [Horn honks in distance] 
 Deirdre! 
 Hey, Dee! 
 Hey, Dee! It's Sean. Come to the window! 
 Hey, I need to talk to you. Hey. 
 Sean, what are you doing here? 
 Dee, I need to see you, all right? 
 Sean, I can't right now. I'm sorry. 
 Well, now, come on, I had a really shitty night. 
 Just come down and open the door, would you, please? 
 Hey, pal, you heard the girl. Get lost! 
 John, go inside. I can handle this. 
 No, take care of... let me take...  go inside. 
 I can handle this. 
 Who the hell is this piece of sh1t? 
 He's a friend, okay? 
 Yeah, well, if he's got something to say to me, he could come on down here and say it to my face! 
 Sean, you're drunk. Go home. I'll call you tomorrow, okay? 
 So this is why you couldn't come to the Sunday dinner, huh? 
 You couldn't sit down with my family 'cause you were hanging out with this prick? 
 Sean, go home. 
 You know what? Bring him on back out of there. 
 Hey, Prick! Come on back out of here. 
 I wanna talk to you, huh? What? You got something to say now? 
 Hey, get off the car! 
 Oh, what? I'm s... is this your car? 
 Sean...  
 Yeah, what's it to you? 
 Yeah, do you like this car? 
 Hey! 
 No, don't. 
 You like that? 
 Hey, what do you think you're doing? 
 Do you like hanging out with my girl? 
 Hey, stop it! 
 Is that what you like, huh? You like this car? 
 Sean... you know, I think this car needs a little remodeling! 
 Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? No, hey! Don't! 
 Hey, what are you doing? 
 You know what? Next time, do yourself a favor and don't go near my girl. 
 Do not! Put that down! 
 Hey...  
 Sean, no! 
 Don't you...  
 Damn it, Sean! 
 [Woman shouts in distance, metal clanks] 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 Have a nice night, lovebirds. 
 [Dogs barking] 
 So you left Kay's apartment tonight knowing you were gonna kill him? 
 [Sighs] What was the alternative? All right? 
 He wanted to kill us. But why is that your job? 
 All right, look, when I was a kid, my dad was involved in a shootout, and the guy got away. 
 And for years, I could never sleep. 
 I would lay in bed every night, terrified that this skell was going to show up at our apartment to try and get revenge on my dad. 
 He was gonna come in and kill my dad, kill my mom, kill me and my sisters. 
 Until one day my dad comes home from work and says we don't have to worry about this skell anymore because it's been taken care of. 
 What does that mean? Your father killed him? 
 Well, as he explained to us that night... 
 There are certain things you have to do to protect your family. 
 Well, what if it's the other way? 
 What if you were the one who got killed? 
 No, no, that wasn't gonna happen. 
 No, but what if it did? Where would me and the kids go? 
 What would we do? 
 Look, I'm a cop. That's always a possibility. 
 But financially, the job will take care of you. 
 [Scoffs] 
 And there are some friends of mine who would make sure that you and the kids are more than okay. 
 What do you mean, "friends"? Do I even know these people? 
 Some of them. 
 But that's all I'm gonna say.
