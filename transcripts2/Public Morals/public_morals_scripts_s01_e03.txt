 All right, listen up in here! 
 I am burying my best friend today... John O'Bannon. 
 Now he was whacked right outside these doors. 
 So I want you to tell everyone you know that I am looking for the son of a bitch who did it, and when I find him, I am gonna cut his goddamn head off and bring it in here and put it on this bar, and we're gonna celebrate, huh? 
 ♪♪ 
 Now  sláinte. 
 ♪♪ Any of Youse in the bar that night? Hmm? Nobody knows anything, huh? Hey, what about you, big man, huh? You know anything? You know anything? What are you, a mute? All right. Okay. What about you, sweetheart? Huh? You know anything? You're a newbie. Huh? You see anything? You hear anything? [Sighs] ♪♪ Okay, nobody knows anything. Well, if you find out something, you come and find me, huh? [Glass bangs] ♪♪ Man : If you ask me, that prick got what he deserved. [Man laughs] ♪ Someone to miss when you're away ♪ I'm sorry, brother. I didn't hear you. Did you say something? Hey, take it easy, pal. He was only joking around. Oh, yeah, you were only joking around. You joke around about my dead best friend? Huh? Oh! [Grunting] [Thud, glass shatters] Hey, what about you, comedian? You got any more funny jokes? Anybody else? Huh?! Anybody else?! ♪♪ Keep looking at me! Tough guys! [Door bangs open] ♪ Be loved ♪ Take a good look at him, James. What you do not see underneath that nice suit are the bullet holes in his chest. You have any fantasies about wanting to be a tough guy? Think of him. This is where you'll end up. Can I touch him? Why do you wanna touch him? I've never touched a dead person before. I wanna see what they feel like. They feel cold. Can I? [Gasps] Come on. Who are all these people? Friends of your Uncle's. Mostly degenerate gamblers and other lowlifes and the women that love them. So... do you think Mr. Patton will be here soon? Do me a favor. Don't worry about that, okay? Just go take a seat, say a prayer, and hope you don't end up an idiot like the rest of them. Before we pay our respects, Mr. O., we should discuss who's going to get his book. He was a good earner. He'll be hard to replace. If you ask me, I say good riddance. And nobody's asking you. You've done enough damage already. No, I did us a favor. He was more trouble than he was worth. He was getting too big in the head. It's an important job. I have to find the right man for it. It's a grave responsibility. Why not give it to me? What about Smitty? Smitty? Smitty? That weasely little piece of sh1t? Are you kidding me? Are you deliberately trying to provoke me? No, I'm trying to give you my opinion, sir. Your opinion? Nobody asked you for your goddamn opinion. Oh, so now I can't speak my mind. Your mind? Oh, Jesus, your mind. Do me a favor, would ya? Get the hell outta here. Go to the kitchen. Stay in the kitchen till I call you. I don't wanna see you. I don't wanna hear from you. I don't wanna think about you. Get the hell out! Sir. What the hell is wrong with that kid?! He's your son. [Sighs] Sometimes I wonder about that. Listen. Why not give Mr. O.'s operation to Rusty? Could be just the kind of thing he needs. You know, like you were talking about. Give him something with some real responsibility. That brain-dead eejit I just sent out of here? Are you off of your rocker? No chance in hell. Well, I'll tell you what I don't like about Smitty. I don't think we can really trust him. I think his allegiance is always gonna be with O'Bannon. And he's gotta have some suspicions about who did his best friend. And then we'll have a meeting with Mr. Smith. Find out where his loyalties lie. And if we don't like his answers? Well, you promised me you'd clean this place up now, didn't ya? [Ice rattles] Hey, kid. How you doin'? Okay, I guess. How you doin'? You know what? I'm in shock. I can't believe my best friend is laying up there. Were you friends a long time? Yeah, probably since I was your age. You know, I was a scrappy little kid. I used to hang around in the pool hall all the time, and Mr. O. put me to work. What'd you do for him? Cleaned up around the place, you know. Ran errands. sh1t like that. Eventually I became a runner for him. Then I became his right hand. And so now... here we are. So...  who do you think killed him? How did you know Mr. O.? He's my Uncle. Or I guess my dad's Uncle. Hey, kid...  Who's your father? Terry Muldoon. Is that a fact? It was nice talking to you, kid. Sorry for your loss. So? Talk about delusional. Your aunt Kay's going on about what a sweetheart he was. You see how lucky you are, gorgeous? You didn't make such a bad choice with me after all, did ya? I'm gonna find James, and then we're getting out of here, okay? All right, just come and find me and say goodbye before you go. Okay. Thanks. Hey, Mr. Muldoon. What do you say, Richie? I should've been there that night. If I was there, none of this would've happened. You care to shed a little light on what you think went down? I got a few theories, and I hope for their sake that you get to them before I do. Richard, if you know something or you find out something, you better come and see me first. And if you're dumb enough to do anything on your own, you know what you're facing, right? I'm sorry, John. [Sniffles] Been meaning to ask you, how's your mother holding up? Ah, she's fine. [Clock tolling in distance] [Horn honks in distance] Hey, Sean. How you doing? Sorry about your pops. Danny boy. Hey. So... you boys in blue don't have any clues, do ya? No. And we don't really give a sh1t who killed him either. One less mutt on the street to worry about. [Laughs] Well... You had your deal with him, and I had mine, but he was always good to me. So I'm gonna get to the bottom of this bullshit, and somebody, whoever it is, is gonna have to answer to me. Well, imagine this, Richie. What if it was me? I think you know. [Chuckles] Anytime, asshole, and I'll leave my shield and gun at home. All right. I don't know about that. Come on, Richie. Let's go get a beer, all right? [Horn honks in distance] [Door closes] Prick. You really don't give a sh1t who killed your father? No. And you know why? 'Cause the first memory I have of that prick is him coming in, drunk from the night before and hauling off on my mom because his breakfast wasn't warm enough. What do you think of that? What do we know? Any news? Any news? Anything? Nothing yet. We're just waiting to see if Patton shows his face. When he gets here, we ought to ask him directly what he knows. Oh, yeah, what he knows. My money says that he's the one who called the shot. What are you, a friggin' moron? Are you a moron? That doesn't make any sense. Patton had no reason to take out Mr. O. O. was making him a lot of money. Yeah, but there is more to be made, so maybe somebody tipped Patton off to what Mr. O. was planning. He wasn't planning sh1t. You were the one planning. You were the one putting all those stupid ideas in his head about taking over, okay? He never talked about anything like that until you came up with it. There's nothing stupid about that idea, Smitty. It would just take some balls... Maybe something you don't got. Easy does it, Richie. I don't care how many cops are in here. [Chuckles] Oh, man. I should smack the sh1t out of you right now. Yeah. You should. But you won't, and do you know why? Because you got no balls. You know how many big mouths like you I've seen come and go over the years? [Exhales deeply] They come. They talk a lot. And then they go, usually with one in the back of the head. You just keep talkin', tough guy. [Brakes squeal] [Car doors closing] Man : sh1t. That's Joe Patton? Man : It is. [Indistinct conversations] Man : Yeah, I told you he was gonna be here. [Indistinct conversations] Hey, what do you wanna do? You wanna go inside? Might be good for a laugh. I won't go in there and pay my respects to that piece of sh1t. But there is somebody I should check in on. How the hell are you, John? You goddamn wife-beating jackass, you. I warned you. Didn't I warn you? Keep your mouth shut. I hope for your sake, John, the book of  revelations  is wrong. Otherwise, it's a long haul. A long, hot haul. And me not far behind you. [Congregation whispering] Kay... Rusty. I'm still here for you, you know that. Thank you. I mean it. [Inhales sharply] Thought I could stop by the apartment this week if that's all right, you know, check on you. I'd like that.

John O'Bannon was a good friend for a good many years. His death weighs heavily on my heart. We cannot and we must not stand for anyone thinking that they can come into this neighborhood... Our neighborhood... And strike down one of our own. [All cheer] I promise you men, we will find out who is responsible for this, and by God, he will pay. All : Aye! Cheers. Here's to John O'Bannon... One hell of a good man. [Under breath] Yeah, if you like wife-beatin' drunks. Patton : Drinks for everyone. [All cheer] Your money is no good today. [All cheer] [Clears throat] Whoa, Nelly! Michael, my good man. Well, what a pleasure it is to see you. Well, it's been a few years, Joseph. It's a shame it takes a tragedy like this to bring us together. Wakes and weddings, Michael. Hmm? Wakes and weddings. I know how tough this must be on you and how much you cared for good old John. More than people might expect... Which is why I was so impressed with your toast. We should have lunch together soon, huh? Get to the bottom of this together. Oh, I'd love nothing more, but, uh, didn't you retire a few years ago, Sergeant? I've been placed on special detail, given my relation to the deceased. [Chuckles] Well, then... Lunch it is. Give us a call next week, will you? Yeah. God bless. Lunch for old times' sake, huh, Sarge? He was full of sh1t then. He's full of sh1t now. Mark my words, we'll get to the bottom of this. ♪ That sorely has my heart beguiled ♪ Mr. Patton! ♪ Her rosy cheeks ♪ My condolences, Terrance. I appreciate the sentiment, but you and I need to speak. Why not? I'll be in touch. ♪ ... to me the parting glass ♪ 
♪ good night and joy be with you all ♪ Agnes I do not know why you have to call him. You are not being fair. I'm 18 years old. Who says I gotta be fair? I'm your father. All right? Tell your fireman boyfriend you can see him another night. But, dad, he's expecting me. Well, he's gonna have to learn to live with disappointment. 'Cause he ain't going out tonight, all right? Now sit down with the rest of us and have your dinner. And if I don't? Don't bother coming back. But, dad, it's my birthday. [Speaking German] Okay, enough. You see? You wanna get your grandmother upset? Guten appetit! Let's go. Ding dongs, put that away. No comics at the table. Woman : Hey, baby. You need anybody? Come here, cutie. Hey, sweetheart. You wanna have fun tonight? How you doing? Muldoon : Hey, asshole! Yeah, right, over here! Come here. Get in the goddamn car. Hey, Terry, Terry, Terry. How are ya? Get in the car, moron. It's always good to see ya. First of all, I just wanna say what a shame it was, what happened to Mr. O., but I can't say it breaks my heart. Yeah, so what are you saying? You had a problem with him? No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't like him. But nobody liked him. I mean, am I right or am I right? He had a lot of enemies. You should know. You should know the lead detective on the case has you at the top of his list. And the sooner he can pin this on somebody, the happier everybody's gonna be. Whoa, whoa, I'm not a killer, Terry. You know that. You know me since I was 4. Come on. I know, I know. Come on, come on. Five years in the joint. People change, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, change for the better. I mean, now if I got a problem with somebody, I turn the other cheek. I walk away. I got no interest in getting pinched again. That's good. Yeah, that's good to hear, because I am gonna give you an opportunity to save yourself. And I think you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know. I know what you want, but I'm no stoolie. Come on. [Both grunt] You do not have a choice, you stupid son of a bitch. Uhh! Numerous favors have been done for you over the years. Now it is your time to reciprocate. Are we clear? Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Good, good. I'm sure you heard about the whore who got whacked the other night. Yeah. Everybody knows about that. I need you to find out who she hung out with. You think you can handle that? Yeah, I can handle that, Terry. And from now on, when you hear I'm looking for you, you will be easy to be found. You can find me. Now get the hell outta my car. I'm going. I'm going. [Chuckles] Go ahead, Agnes. Blow 'em out. [Blows air] Yeah. [Speaks German] I got somethin' for my little girl. [Gasps] Yeah. Happy Birthday, sweetheart. Oh, daddy, it's beautiful. You like that? Thank you so much. [Speaks German] Nah, come on, mom. She deserves the best. So do you think... No. You still can't go out though. [Door creaks] Oh, Chris, you're still awake. Yeah. How are you? I'm good. How were the kids tonight? They were fine. Although James regaled them with stories from the wake. Did you really let him touch the body? Yeah. I might have. Why? It's not right, and I'm pretty sure it's a sin. That is not a sin. Well, James was very impressed with the whole affair. He's been walking around talking like Humphrey Bogart all day. Well, if you can believe it, when I was a kid growing up in this neighborhood, even I was impressed with the gangsters. But like I had my father to knock some sense into me, James has got me to do the same for him. Rather than knocking some sense into him, wouldn't it be easier to just move? Uh, yeah, but it would be a lot more expensive, whereas a smack doesn't cost us a thing. Sometimes I'd like to give you a little smack. Yeah, well, there's no time like the present, gorgeous. You'd have better luck if you got home an hour ago. And go brush your teeth. You smell like a brewery. [Sighs] I'll be back with fresh breath. Congratulations. I'll be asleep. [Horns honking in distance] Hey, sweetie. You got something for me? Ah, not tonight, not tonight. [Door closes] Hey, Smitty. Hey. Hey, Davis. You know, that was a lousy freaking break for Mr. O. Regardless, it was still a good day. Well, that's good. Oh, man. Uh...  You know... It pisses me off 'cause I got... I got no idea who did it. None. No idea. You and me...  We're gonna have a drink. All right. To John. To John. [Clink] It's dead as a doornail in here. Who's...  Why's it so quiet? Big guy's in back. He's been waitin' for you. Big guy? Patton? He's here? For me? What do... F-f-for why? I'm just the messenger, Smitty. I pour your drinks, I take your bets, and I don't ask questions. Hey, Smitty, how you doing, pal? My brother would like to have a few words with you. Uh, yeah, sure. Yeah, come on. All right. After you. Do us a favor, Davis. Lock that door. Oh, there he is. There he is. Sit down. Sit down. How are you, Mr. Patton? I've been better. Yeah. Lost a good friend. I'll miss him, as I'm sure you will as well. Mr. O. was a good friend. He was. Good to me, you know? Unfortunately, we don't have time to mourn the dead. There's business to be done. The show must go on, as they say. I just have a few questions to ask. Do you have any idea at all who may have been responsible for the murder of our mutual friend? You know, a lot of people... Some people have been saying that they think it was his kid, Sean. Uh, I'm not seeing it. Outside of Shakespeare, very few sons kill their fathers, so, no, I don't believe it was Sean. Anybody else in mind? Mr. O. was not exactly loved... [Chuckles] In the neighborhood, and even less so outside of hell's kitchen. So it could have been anybody. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, yeah, I guess it could've been. Yes, it's the ugly side of what we do. We make a lot of enemies, which is why it's important to keep your friends close, and, you know, a lot of these cases the police just don't give a sh1t. Very few of these things are solved, you know? And which is, of course, a damn shame, but, uh, what can one do? Hmm? Sometimes it's best just to let it go. Wouldn't you agree with that? Yeah, right. Let sleeping dogs lie. That's it. That's it exactly. Let sleeping dogs lie. Why don't you have your drink? You've hardly touched it. Oh. [Clatters] Let me pour you another one. You know, my second question actually is more of a request, and of course, it depends upon whether you would like the opportunity to make a great deal more money. Would you like that, Smitty? Yes, sir. Uh, yeah, very much so. Mm. Well, of course, everyone knows that, uh, you were Mr. O.'s right hand. Well, yeah, you knew the business inside out and you knew all the other bookies and the runners and the banks. And I don't think you're someone who's likely to try something stupid now, are you? No, sir. I know my place. Now what about John's crew? Were you able to get along with them? Yeah. Most of 'em. So you think that they would support you if you took over his operation? Absolutely. How about yourself? Well, how would you feel about profiting from John's death? Well, I wouldn't... I wouldn't put it that way, exactly. He was... my fr... He was a friend of mine. You know, Mr. Patton, if you give me this chance... [Inhales deeply] You'll have my full loyalty. Well, good. Then that's what we'll do. Shall we drink to it? To keeping your friends close. [Clink] [Clears throat] 
 
 [Children shouting playfully] Louisiana, what do you say? What's the news? I'm hearing nothin' about that whore that was killed. Nothin' about your Uncle either. Oh, that's great. What the hell am I doing here then? Well, I got a tip that's more profitable in nature. All right. I'll bite. What do you got? High stakes poker game you might be interested in. Getting pretty big, from what I hear. Real big money, lot of action. And who's gaming it? Who's running it? You gon' love this. It's moose Tedesco's youngest son... The one who went away to college. Are you kiddin' me? Moose's kid? Are you absolutely sure about this? 100%? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. That prick is gonna pay. When and where? Uptown on the east side. One of them private clubs. Big money them kids are playing, from what I hear. $2,000 buy-in, they're saying. That's great. That's great. I still need the name of the club. It's called the stockbridge house. Third floor's the card room. On Friday nights, they got the tables goin'. That's good, Lou. That's good. If this is legit, I'll double what I just gave you. If it's bullshit... I know, I know. I got no interest in going back to prison, Officer. [Silverware clinking] Sir, I just wanna say thank you so much for taking us to lunch today. Ah. How long have you two known each other? About a year now. And we're very much in love. Well, I get it. You said that like a dozen times already. I understand, all right? I got it. Well, how long have you been a fireman? Three years, sir. And why didn't you think about joining the cops? My father is a fireman, so it's been a dream of mine since I was a little kid. Yeah, well, I'm sorry to hear that. Come on, daddy. Be nice. [Lowered voice] Go ahead. Ask him. [Clears throat] I'd like to marry your daughter, sir. And I'd like your blessing. I promise I-I will take very, very good care of her. Yeah, well, I had a feeling that's what this lunch was about. But I have some questions for you, Agnes. What about college? You're already enrolled in Marymount. I can still go. We don't wanna have kids right away like you and mom did, and that way, I can work for a few years and save some money, and then with both our paychecks, we can buy a real nice house in Brooklyn. Brooklyn? Why would you wanna live in Brooklyn? It's very nice out near Ryan's parents place. Oh. You met his parents? Just a...  Just a couple times. It's okay, daddy. I love him...  And he loves me. Please, will you give us your blessing? No, it's, uh... No, it's better than okay. This is... This is a good thing. This... It's a beautiful thing, and you have my blessing. Thank you so much, daddy. [Laughs] Do you... do you wanna ride out with us later and share the news? No, no, no. You, uh... You tell Ryan's parents I said congratulations, and I'll have plenty of time to meet them as you start to plan the wedding, so... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. You seem like a nice kid, and you obviously come from a nice family... In spite of the fact that your father encouraged you to be a fireman. [Chuckles] I'll tell you this one time, all right? Treat my daughter with respect, okay? If she feels one minute of pain because of you... I'll end ya. All right? I ain't just talkin' about beatin' the sh1t out of you. I ain't no fireman. I'm a cop. I carry a gun, remember? All right? No, no, I-I understand, sir. You're never gonna have to worry about that. All right, good. Let's celebrate. Cora, can I get another round of beers? [Clinks] [Indistinct conversations] [Blues music playing] Hey, Terry. [Mouth full] There's the man. What do you say, Vince? Looks good. Thanks for coming down. All right, so what's so important? All right. I just got a tip that seems a little odd to me. And I figured I should run it by you, see what you make of it. Yeah, of course. What is it? All right. High stakes card game uptown at one of those private university clubs. Sounds good. What's the problem? Here's the thing. My stoolie says that Moose Tedesco's kid is running the game. As far as I know, we do not have it on the list. Can't be. If it's not on the list, it can't be one of Tedesco's games. Your guy's gotta be wrong. No. I don't know. This stoolie's information is always solid. The kid has never let me down before. I'm not buying it. Moose wouldn't pull that kind of sh1t with me. What about I just call him right now and find out what the hell the deal is? No. I've already checked in with the lieutenant. He wants to take it to Johanson. If the captain okays it, we're gonna hit the game tonight. You're gonna make me drink alone? Yeah. Can I get a bourbon over here? [Horns honking in distance] Just a heads up, Smitty. Kane and Hopkins are inside looking for you. All right. You bums have nothing better to do than hang out here all afternoon drinking beer? Actually, we do, Mr. Big Shot. We got some very important business to discuss. Oh, Big Shot, huh? Yeah, well, somebody filled you in on the good news, huh? How do you figure that's good news? Now we're right back to where we were. Oh, excuse me. Do you not know... Do you not understand how this works? This is a money-making enterprise that we're involved with here. Everything that we do is about making money, all right? That's it. All right? Now with Mr. O. gone... With Mr. O... . God rest his soul... Singing with the angels, everybody gets a bigger piece of the profits now. But it's still small-time bullshit. Right? What about our bigger plan? That's where the real money is. Now maybe Mr. O. Bought into your, uh... Bullshit pipe dreams about taking over the West Side. I don't. If you wanna do that, there's the door. You go do that, all right? You leave me out of it. Yeah, 'cause you're a goddamn coward. You know, what is it with you, Kane? What is it with you? I got no interest in starting a war with Patton, a war we can't possibly win. Patton's an old man. His crew is nothin' but old men. You know, I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall here. Let me just tell you. All I wanna do is make as much money as I can and get out of this racket before I end up in jail or dead in the river like Mr. O. So put your bullshit plans to bed already. You got it? Look at me. Oh, who's the coward now? [Little Richard's "Long Tall Sally" playing] [Grunting] ♪♪ [Grunting] [Cocks gun] [Chuckles] Got any more big ideas, huh? Get these punks outta here.

But I don't think you do, Lieutenant. I don't think I've had the pleasure. [French accent] If you had, you would have surely remembered. Helena Latour. Pleased to meet you. Lonnie King. And how are you, Terrance? Well, I've got nothing to complain about. And you? How are things at the shop? All is good. My girls are happy and healthy. Maybe one day I'll convince you to pay us more than a cursory visit. I think you're doing fine without my patronage, however I think the lieutenant might take you up on that offer. Of course, please, come see us anytime you like. Just not tonight. Now what can I do for you two? Are you here to eat? Or are you here to talk? We need a couple minutes of your time, captain. Then I'll take this opportunity to freshen up. Can you believe the ass on that one? I can't get enough of that broad. So what do you got? Muldoon got wind of a big card game that's being run by one of Tedesco's kids, and it's not on the list. Hasn't this prick done this before? Trying to hide some sh1t on us? Yeah, but it's always been small-time bullshit. Vince always gave him the slide, given that they're old friends. This time, it sounds like it's the real deal. Clearly this jackoff thinks he can screw with us. Latucci's in too tight with that fat Guinea. I always said that. Well, if that's indeed the case, then we gotta let Tedesco know otherwise. What do you wanna do? I say we burn his ass and hit the game tonight. It's the biggest night with the most money. And if Tedesco's there, we grab him and the kid. You sure you wanna do that, captain? Might cause some problems for Tucch. Screw Latucci. This Tedesco's starting to think he's a little too slick. He's jerking Vince around because of their history. I guess it's time to make him pay. Anything else? That's it. And, gents, after it's all over, don't forget. I got a birthday coming up. [Chuckles] Darling... Santé. Mm. [Rotary dial clicking] Hey, this is, uh, Charlie Bullman. Yeah, yeah, the cop. How are ya? Hey, I was, um, I was wondering if, um, if there's a possibility that maybe you're, um... Are you free tonight? Yeah. Yeah, that would be good. Okay. All right. All right, I'll see you soon. All right, bye. [Clatter] [Clatter] [Cabinet door closes] [Speaks German] I gotta go to work, ma. [Speaks German] No, it's not that late, ma. Don't worry about me. Just go to sleep, all right? I'll see you in the morning, okay? Love you, ma. [Speaks German] All right, go to sleep. Let me ask you something, Petey. You ever look at yourself in the mirror? Hmm? Look at this suit. Where'd you pick this thing up, the salvation army? What are you talkin' about? I've had this suit for years. That's my point. No one's ever complained about it before. Look at me. This is how you dress to impress. Think about Terry... Conservative like a banker, simple blue suit, nice shirt, sharp tie. You  cannot  walk around like this, kid. You look like a bum. Whoa, I do  not  look like a bum. This is a look I put together to pass myself off as a rube from out of town. You look like you you're spit-washing car windows on Delancey Street. Hey. That's all right. All right. One of these days, I'm gonna take you over to Brooks Brothers, doll you up right. My treat. Is that right? Huh? Okay? Hey, Terry. What do you say, boys? Terry, let me ask you something. This suit...  It's fine, right? Yeah, sure, if we were going to your confirmation tonight. Tucch, quick word. Is it still on the table? Did I tell ya? Breaking his balls over here. Listen, I spoke to king and we both think it's best if you sit this one out tonight. If Tedesco's old man is there, we're gonna grab him, too. What are you trying to do to me? You can't grab the Moose. Johanson okayed it, and you yourself said this guy's been jerking you around lately. So you take the night off, and we're gonna bring in Bullman instead. Does Johanson have a bug up his ass with Tedesco I don't know about? I don't know. What do you want me to say? Maybe he doesn't like Italians. Petey Mac. Association : ♪ that I am not gonna be the one ♪ 
♪ to share what seems to be the life that you could ♪ [Liquor pouring] ♪ Cherish as much as I ♪ [Bottle clatters] ♪ Cherish you ♪ That doctor did a good job, no? It's gonna be fine. Yeah. Thanks for that again. Ah, it's the least I can do. Also, I, uh, I got this for you. What...  what's this? Well, when I visited Mr. Smith, he insisted on compensating you for the amount of time you're gonna be out of work. Oh, my God. How much is this? It's over 2 grand. He was, uh, very apologetic. What'd he say? Not much, actually. Mm. So maybe it's a good idea if you take some of that money and get yourself a new apartment. You know, given the amount of complaints we had, who knows? It's, uh, probably best to get a new address. Who knows? Maybe, uh, maybe even get out of this business altogether. You're...  you're a nice, pretty girl. You don't need to be doing that. You know that, right? Yeah. Well, I should get going. So I'll, uh... I'll see you around, kid. I was worried you didn't get the message. Where the hell you been? No, I was taking care of some sh1t. Nothing important. What, are you wearing cologne? You reek. No, it's aftershave. What is this? You smell like some kind of French whore. Nah, don't worry about what I smell like. Hey, Blondie, what do you say, huh? Fellas, can I help you? Yeah, you can help me. Uhh! Yeah. Get your ass outta here. Get him outta here. Hey, beautiful, where you been all my life? Guess what, sweetheart? It's time to hit the bricks, all right? [Indistinct conversations] All right, everybody, listen up. I want you all to put your hands where we can see them, stand up, and move away from the table. Get your hands where we can see 'em, or I'm gonna start breaking fingers. And nobody touches nothin'. Muldoon : Everything on these tables is evidence. It is all gonna be seized and vouched. Hey, asshole, you deaf, huh? Come on. Petey, toss him for weapons. Spread 'em. Ladies and gentlemen, the last thing we wanna do is lock up a bunch of young men and women for playing cards, but that is our job. You break the law and you get caught, you go to jail. He's clean, Terry. However... Tonight, you caught us in a very forgiving mood. On almost any other night, what would we do, bull? We'd throw your asses in the paddy wagon and send you to the tombs. But tonight we're gonna make an exception because I assume a lot of you are probably first-time offenders. Oh, yeah. In order to let you go, we need to identify the men that organized this game. If we do that, you can all be on your merry way. And if we cannot do that, you are all gonna get locked up, and we can figure it out tonight in a jail cell, and, ladies, that includes you, too. Understood? Who did it, huh? Who set this up? Anybody? You ain't got no idea who set this up? You don't know who you're messing with. No idea. Whoa! Mully. Ha. I think we got our guy. Tedesco's boy? Yeah, and I suggest you get my father on the phone right now. You're gonna have a major goddamn problem on your hands. Oh. I think you got it ass-backwards, kid. It's your old man who's gonna have the problem. We'll see about that. [Chuckles] Bull... Sit his ass down, will ya? Come here, handsome. Sit down, or I'll stick my foot up your ass. Go ahead. What? All right. You got lucky. Petey, grab the three dealers. The rest of you are free to get the hell outta here. Let's go. Move your asses. Get outta here. Let's go. Move before we change our minds. Go. Bullman : Get out. Come on, Four Eyes. Let's go. Go ahead and sit your asses down, gentlemen. I'm going to assume you already know the routine, by the looks of Youse. So go ahead and get comfy, all right? And as for you, young man, I got bad news. You're getting pinched tonight, and there's nothing your old man can do to help you out. So I suggest you keep your friggin' mouth shut and take your collar like a man. Because I'd hate to have to tell your pops that you bitched and moaned like a little girl. [Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels' "Jenny Take a Ride!" playing] Charlie, good to see ya. [Siren wailing in distance] Bobby... have a taste. Thanks, Petey. Say hi to the wife for me, all right? You got it. Hey, Slick! Watch that you don't bump your head. Don't worry. It'll be a smooth ride. [Car doors close] Gentlemen, that is what you call one hell of a score. ♪ Oh, see, C.C. Rider ♪
