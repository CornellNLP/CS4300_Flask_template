 [Brakes squeal] 
 [Groans] 
 Terrance Muldoon. 
 Mr. Patton, how are you? 
 Well, that was a pretty decent turnout for your dear Uncle's wake. 
 Especially for a guy with no friends. 
 Oh, what... I was his friend. 
 Really? I'm surprised to hear that, actually. 
 And why is that? 
 Well, the night before he got killed, he told me he thought you weren't keeping a close enough eye on the neighborhood. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Said he thought you'd gotten complacent, even called you soft. 
 Mm. 
 Said maybe it was time for some changes. 
 Well, he was right about that, wasn't he? 
 They just weren't the changes that he had in mind. 
 [Chuckles] No, they were not. [Laughs] 
 So, what do we think happened to dear old John? 
 I know what happened to dear old John. 
 He had a big mouth. 
 And I bet you have no idea who's responsible for it, do you? 
 Oh, Terrance. 
 Terrance, wouldn't I tell you if I did know? 
 [Thunder rumbling] 
 I heard you gave a wonderful little toast at the wake, something about vowing vengeance? 
 Well, maybe vengeance has already been taken. 
 I really hope you're not talking about the two mutts who got whacked at the long branch, because I know for a fact they both work for your son Rusty. 
 I have no idea what happened to those two gonifs. 
 I'm sure nobody gives a damn, either. 
 Oh, yeah? Not even Rusty? 
 Rusty. 
 Who knows what goes on inside that kid's head? 
 Hmm. 
 Well, that might explain why you gave my Uncle's book to sSmitty instead of your own son. 
 I gave it to Smitty because Smitty was the right man for the job, and so far he's doing just fine. 
 Yeah, it's interesting. You know, Smitty would be the guy who would have the most to gain from John's death, wouldn't he? 
 You're right. He would have, wouldn't he? 
 You're not gonna give me a thing today, are you? 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Look, Mr. Patton, whatever went down, we cannot have it escalate. 
 Neither one of us wants a war going on in the neighborhood. 
 If that happens, I can't be anywhere near you, and you do not want me pulling the plug on your business. 
 Do we have anything left to discuss? 
 If we do, I will be in touch. 
 I'll be waiting all aquiver. 
 God bless. 
 What did he say? 
 He's at the barbershop. 
 He was supposed to meet me here at 3:30. 
 He said he's sorry. He had to cancel. 
 And he also said he's not gonna be able to make the nut this week. 
 It's always the same poor-mouth song and dance with your Uncle. 
 That's not true. Business is slow. 
 Maybe the restaurant business, but that's not what we're talking about, are we? 
 So you let him know. 
 I'm gonna be back here Saturday night. 
 I expect to see him here. 
 I'll pass the message. 
 Can I get you anything else? 
 Yeah. Come sit down with me for a second. 
 Oh... 
 Anybody upstairs in the apartment? 
 No. But I'm working. And so are you. 
 Mm, you're working, all right. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Come on. Let's go have a little fun. 
 Vince, I can't. I got to stay down here. 
 Who the hell's gonna miss you if you disappear for a few minutes? 
 I'd be more than happy to give you more than a few minutes if you took me out for a proper date. 
 So, if you really want to see me that bad, why don't you come by later when we close, and you can wine and dine me? 
 You know I can't do that, Bernadette. 
 Your loss. 
 Terry! Hey! 
 There he is. 
 So, what'd you hear about my dead hooker? 
 Terry, I swear to you, I'm not jerking you around, but I haven't heard sh1t. 
 Just another hooker, right? Nobody gives a sh1t. 
 You know, Duffy, I actually have some stoolies that I like. 
 You're not one of them. 
 But even those other assholes know if they don't give me what I want, I make their lives miserable, so guess what? 
 They give you what you want. 
 Exactly. 
 And oprobation, too. 
 Any minor offense, I can throw your ass right back upstate. 
 Terry... 
 To say nothing of the fact that battalina still likes you for the Mr. O murder. 
 Terry, that's crazy! I didn't do that. 
 I know. 
 I didn't do that. You know that. 
 I know. 
 You know I didn't. 
 I know, but those are the breaks. 
 Now, you can help your cause by giving me something I need. 
 So why don't you start by telling me what you know about those two mopes, Rogers and O'Reilly. 
 They were with Rusty's crew. 
 No sh1t, asshole. 
 I'm not jerking around here, all right? 
 Any idea, though, maybe, on who went apeshit on them with a hunting knife? 
 I swear to you, Terry, I don't know. 
 I could ask around, you know, try to find out what people know. 
 All right, maybe I haven't made myself clear! 
 You're either gonna start talking, or I am dragging your ass down to the probation office. 
 You got me? 
 Okay, okay, I'll do whatever you want. 
 What do you want? What do you want? 
 I need to get to Rusty Patton. [Groans] 
 You're gonna go see him. Tell him you need a job. 
 You're gonna get on the inside and find out what the Pattons know and what their involvement is in this bullshit. 
 Terry, that's impossible. How am I gonna do that? 
 You're gonna have to figure it out. 
 Last chance, Duffy. 
 Don't make me come looking for you. 
 You got me? 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Sergio, get the goddamn phone! 
 [Rings] [Sighs] 
 Yeah? 
 It's Latucci. Get me Sally. 
 All right, hang on. 
 Pa? 
 Yeah? 
 Vince. 
 Vince... [sighs] 
 You're a real hard-on, you know that? 
 Oh, yeah? Where the hell were you today? 
 I got pulled into some other sh1t. 
 It took priority over you, especially after you locked up my kid. 
 Don't give me your bullshit, Sally. 
 You only got one person to blame for the kid getting collared, and that's you. 
 It ain't right, Vince. I've always been good to you. 
 And I've always done the right thing by you, too. 
 [Lowered voice] I'm not having this conversation on the phone, Sal. 
 Meet me at the Fish market in an hour and we can talk then. 
 [Speaks Italian] 
 [Phone slams] 
 Hey, shea, go find something to do, will you? 
 What do you have in mind? 
 You want me to wipe your ass for you, too, you prick? 
 [Exhales] 
 Hey, Rusty... How's it going? 
 Yeah... [Muttering indistinctly] 
 Is he down this way? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Hey, Rusty, Rusty. 
 First of all, I just want to say how grateful I am, uh, for you taking the time to... to see me. 
 I really appreciate it. 
 Shut up. 
 I tolerate you for one reason, Duffy. 
 I gave your father my word that I would look out for you. 
 Now sit down. 
 Right, right. 
 I also want to thank you for giving me a shot with my card game. 
 That really meant the world to me. 
 And as much as I had a little hiccup with my friend Seany, it's nothing that can't be worked out, and I want you to know, I'm gonna smooth things over with Seany. 
 We're gonna get that game back. 
 Forget about your game. The game is done. 
 There's too much heat right now, especially after what happened to Rogers and O'Reilly. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard about that. 
 What the hell? That's some crazy sh1t. 
 You guys know who did it? 
 I'm looking into it. 
 Right, right. 
 So, look, if the game is done, is there anything else I can do for you? 
 No. 
 Anything at all? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 Your father? I'm antsy to get back to work. 
 Just like you, I got out of the can a little while ago, so... 
 You know, anything at all. Anything. 
 You know me. I'll do... I'll do whatever you need. 
 You know Richie Kane, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Yeah, sure, we went to high school together. 
 I need to talk to him about some business that we have. 
 You think you can find him? 
 Yeah, absolutely. Done. 
 I don't want him or nobody else knowing that I'm looking for him. Do you understand me? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 You do this, I'll see if I can get your game back up. 
 Yeah, you got it. Done. Absolutely. I'm on the case. 
 Piss off. Now. 
 Okay. 
 [Exhales] 
 [Men shouting in distance] 
 [Ship horn blows] 
 Sally, Sally, Sally, for years you've been pulling this bullshit. 
 What bullshit are you talking about, Vince? 
 Come on, you know how many guys we pick up that tell us they're protected by you, covered on your nut, and they're not on your list? 
 It's been going on for years and you know it. 
 Most of the guys are just jerking you, hoping to avoid getting pinched. 
 I know. I know. 
 You've told me that a hundred times, and I let it slide sometimes because we're old friends. 
 [Laughs] Yeah, old friends. Then you go and lock up my kid? 
 Oh! I didn't lock up nobody. I wasn't even there. 
 But he will get pinched again if he starts up another game that isn't covered. 
 Don't be a ball-breaker, Vince. On my word, it was a new game. 
 I just forgot to tell you about it. 
 From today on, put it on my list. 
 Goes without saying, but before we add a new game, you gotta buy back the old one. 
 Of course. No problem. But like I said, it was a new game, maybe about a month old. 
 Could you stop jerking me around for two minutes? 
 We know the game started five months ago when the kid first came back to New York. 
 So, a weekly game at two beans a week works out to $800 a month for five months, which works out to 4 grand. 
 And we get the 4 before the game starts up again. 
 4 grand? That's highway robbery, Vince. 
 And by the way, how much did you and your boys clear that night you broke it up? 
 Given what was on the tables, we know you can easily afford it. 
 Do me a favor. Can you knock it off with this "business is slow" crap? 
 You should have never taken that cop test, Vince. 
 You should have come and worked with us. 
 Just make sure you got the 4 grand tomorrow, or you're done... no more favors. 
 Yeah, what are you gonna do, Vince? You gonna lock me up? 
 One of your oldest friends? 
 Sometimes it's not my call. 
 I'm getting squeezed from the top. 
 So just make sure you got the money, okay? 
 You know, I gotta tell you, Terry, it's a lot of fun being an Italian investigating a homicide here in hell's kitchen because I'm greeted with nothing but smiling faces. 
 Yeah. Yeah, well, now you know what it's like for the rest of us when someone gets whacked on Mulberry Street. 
 Yeah, except you can get a decent meal down there. 
 There's nothing to eat here on the West Side except these pickled eggs. 
 I'll admit, it's an acquired taste. 
 Yeah. You acquire it. [Laughs] 
 No, thanks. 
 So what do we got? What's the news? 
 We... we got shinole. We had two witnesses. 
 The hooker ended up with her brains splattered all over the Avenue, and the tight-lipped bartender is nowhere to be found. 
 And now we got nothing. And the problem is, with your Uncle, Ter, it could be anybody. 
 I know. I know. It's a long list of possibilities. 
 Look, the point I'm trying to make, Terry, is I gotta bail on this. I'm sorry, but I caught two more cases since Sunday, and I don't have the resources to give any time to it. I'm sorry. 
 What about those stabbings at the long branch? 
 Both of those skells were part of Rusty's crew. 
 You know that's no coincidence. 
 Yeah, it could be, but nobody downtown gives a sh1t about who killed two low-level Irish scumbags. [Sighs] 
 And quite honestly, nobody downtown gives a sh1t about who killed your Uncle. 
 Look, you know how they feel. 
 There's no headlines with the micks. 
 So what you're saying is you only care about the dead guineas, is that it? 
 Hey, hey, hey. Come on, don't take it so personally, okay, Irish? 
 But look... a face like this belongs in the papers. 
 I hear you, superstar. 
 So now I'm left to deal with this bullshit on my own. 
 I'm afraid so, but look. 
 You find out anything else, you let me know, and I'll jump back in. 
 But for now, I got to put it on the shelf, okay? 
 And, oh, next time we meet, we eat downtown. 
 My treat. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna hold you to that. Okay. 
 [Sighs] 
 Terry. Perfect timing. 
 Your wife is on the phone. 
 Ah. All right. Thanks, Roland. 
 She say what it's about? 
 Hey, Chris, what's going on? 
 It's James again. 
 He was supposed to be home two hours ago, and I just got call from Mrs. Lopez that she saw James and the Gilroy boys in the schoolyard drinking beer. 
 Can you believe it? 
 All right, well, then why don't you just go over there and drag his ass out of there? 
 I went there already, and they're gone. 
 Oh, Jesus, that stupid son of a bitch. Okay. 
 Call the Gilroys, see what they know, and I will get out of here as soon as I can, all right? 
 Soon as you can. 
 [Sirens wailing, horn honks] 
 So, right here? 
 Yeah. [Panting] 
 He and Rogers are against the bar, and then Kane knifes Roger in the shoulder and then in the guts and then, uh, that's it. 
 Just Kane, nobody else? 
 Yeah, that's it. 
 One guy against three of you? 
 What were you doing when all this was going on? 
 I... I didn't do nothing. I was just behind the bar. 
 And why the hell not? 
 Well, it all happened so fast, Rust, I-I didn't have time to react. 
 Doesn't sound like that to me. 
 Sounds like they were struggling here for a while. 
 Like I said, Rust, I'm behind the bar, I'm reading the paper. 
 Next thing I know, O'Reilly's got his throat slit, he's bleeding all over the floor. 
 Rogers is against the bar. He's been stabbed in the shoulder... you couldn't do nothing, Burke? 
 Nothing at all? 
 Hey, you got a gun behind the bar, right? 
 Did you forget how to use it? Did you? 
 Whoa, whoa, Rusty, Rusty! 
 Did you? 
 He's all right. He didn't do nothing. 
 Come on, you fat b*st*rd. 
 Come on, Rusty, you crazy son of a bitch, leave him alone. 
 Come on. 
 The cops come by, you didn't see nothing. 
 You don't want him coming back, right? 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 [Footsteps overhead] Mrs. Gilroy, I know. As long as they're okay, that's all that matters. 
 Okay. Good-bye. 
 So? 
 He was next door on he Gilroys' roof... getting drunk. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 He should be coming down right now. 
 [Laughs] Oh! 
 This is gonna be something to see. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Oh-ho-ho! There he is! [Claps hands] 
 Another in a long line of hell's kitchen assholes. 
 Come on, dopey, huh? 
 Drunk at the age of 13? Are you kidding me? 
 What are you looking to do, dopey, spend the rest of your life staring at the bottom of a bottle? 
 Oh, James, how dumb can you be? 
 Oh, he can be plenty dumb. 
 He's proved that a thousand times before. 
 Haven't you, moron? [Telephone rings] 
 Take a shower. [Sighs] 
 Hello? 
 It's your father. 
 Come meet me for a drink. I'm over at Clancy's. 
 You know, it's not a good time right now, dad. 
 We're dealing with some sh1t here. 
 More important than your Uncle's murder? 
 Uh, yeah, at least to me it is. 
 You know, don't even give a sh1t, do you? 
 No, I do not, and I don't understand why you do, either. 
 You know what you need to do? Go find a hobby. 
 Learn to play golf and forget about this bullshit. 
 Don't be a wise-ass with me! 
 I care because we gave our word to your aunt Kay. 
 And he's family. 
 He's not my family. 
 Besides, I never cared about that skell to begin with, and right now I got my own family to deal with. 
 Oh, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. You're too busy. 
 That's all right. I'll take care of it. 
 Oh, dad, please, all right? Just leave this alone. 
 When I have some more time, I will look into it, okay? 
 No, no, no. Don't worry about it. 
 Doesn't even concern you anymore. 
 [Sighs] 
 The joys of living in beautiful hell's kitchen. 
 What, kids don't get drunk in the suburbs? 
 Well, you go deal with it then. 
 [Sighs] 
 You still alive in there, dumb-ass? [Shower running] 
 Yeah, leave me alone. 
 He'll live. 
 [Knock on door] 
 [Speaking indistinctly] 
 You wanted to see me, Mr. Patton? 
 Oh, there's our man. 
 How... how'd it go today, Smitty? 
 Yep, it was another good day, boss. 
 Ah, good. I'm glad to hear. Sit down. Sit down. 
 Tell me, Smitty, are you having any trouble at all collecting? 
 Is anybody giving you a hard time since you took over? 
 No, not at all. Not at all. Not at all. 
 All the guys say things are going smooth. 
 Well, that's great. I'm happy to hear that. 
 You know, I... 
 I gave you a great deal of trust with this job. 
 I don't want you to disappoint me now. 
 I won't. I won't. 
 I-I won't disappoint you, Mr. Patton. 
 I promise you that. 
 Good man. 
 Good man. I'm sure you won't. 
 And if you don't, everything will go very well for you, hmm? 
 Well... 
 Smitty, stop at the warehouse before you go home tonight, will you? 
 See the hand. He's got something for you. 
 You want me to go tonight? 
 Tonight, yes. 
 Before you go home.

 So, um, I took your advice and I moved out of my old apartment. 
 That's good. What about my other advice? 
 I don't know that I can. 
 Come on, why not? 
 I make too much money. 
 Oh, sure. But for how long? 
 I don't know. A couple more years. 
 I send the money to my mother and my sister and her kids upstate. 
 All right, you do that for a few more years, then what? 
 Disappear, try and go back and have a normal life. 
 The longer you keep doing this, the harder it is to get out. 
 [Sighs] So, uh, what'd you want to see me about? 
 Well, um, as you know, I'm a loner, and I've done pretty well handling everything on my own. 
 Eh, you know, you've been lucky. 
 I know, which is why I've been thinking that maybe I should go work in a house. 
 And then just last week, through another girl, I was approached by a madam. 
 Who? 
 Helena Latour. You know her? 
 Yeah, I heard of her. 
 What does she want? 
 She said I can make a lot more money. 
 That I'd be safer and I wouldn't have to work out of my apartment. 
 Stacy, why don't you just go back to teaching? 
 You like teaching, right? 
 [Sighs] 
 Look, I got kicked out of the union a few years ago. 
 Someone found out about me, okay? So that's why. 
 I can't ever go back to teaching. 
 All right. 
 Just take it easy, okay? 
 Look, give me a few days. I'll find out what I can about her reputation, see how she treats the girls and, uh, what kind of financial arrangements they make. 
 Thank you.

 We'll meet him over at the barbershop. 
 I don't understand this clown. 
 Doesn't he know if he does not pay his dues to the club, we revoke his membership? 
 He's all right. 
 He's just trying to get over like everybody else. 
 No, no, he's not all right. He's full of sh1t, Tucch. 
 I know he's got eight bookmakers, 10 numbers guys, a couple of card games, and a half-dozen crap games going. 
 And that's all he's telling us about. 
 You know there's other sh1t he's slipping past us, the kid's game being the latest. 
 Yeah, I already talked to him about that. 
 I straightened him out. 
 I should just go over his head, go to Joe Fish himself. 
 No, Terry, I don't think you need to do that yet. 
 Look, I know Sal my entire life. 
 He ain't a bad guy. He's just a pain in the ass. 
 Just let me handle it. 
 [Taps bar] No. I'll come with you tomorrow. 
 Let me play the bad cop. 
 And if he doesn't have all the money? 
 Then he goes. Plain and simple. 
 We're done doing favors for this fat b*st*rd. 
 I don't care how far you go back. 
 This isn't gonna go over well. 
 Too bad about him. 
 Smitty, *** 
 She hates it. Says it's too big. 
 She can't park it. 
 Says I should have bought her one of those little Volkswagens instead. 
 [Laughs] You know, Corcoran, it's in beautiful shape. 
 This is a goddamn gorgeous car. 
 And it's only got 1,500 miles on it? 
 She'll only take it across the bridge to her mother's and back. 
 Like I say, at this price it's a steal. 
 Corcoran, you got yourself a deal. I'm taking it. 
 I'll see you inside in a minute. 
 I'm... 
 I'm doing it. I'm gonna get that car. 
 And I'm not the only one who's getting a new car today. 
 I want you to take the Plymouth. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You can't just give me your car. 
 Look... It's yours. On the cuff. 
 Consider it a token of my appreciation. 
 Hey, Bull. [Sighs] 
 Good afternoon, Charlie. 
 Hey, look who's here. The yankee clipper. 
 Thought they would have transferred your ass by now. 
 They must need you for the softball team, no? 
 [Under breath] Eh, nice to see you, too, Hump. 
 [Knocks] Captain. 
 Talk to you now? 
 Come in. 
 Hey, I was wondering. You know a Helena Latour? 
 Yeah, of course I know her. Why? 
 Well, this girl I collared recently... she's a, uh, she's a nice kid, she's new to the business, so I... I decided to cut her a break. 
 And? 
 Well, this Helena, she wants her to come work at her place. 
 So this girl, she reached out to me, you know, 'cause she wants my advice. 
 Are you kidding me? Have you lost your goddamn mind? 
 You got some hooker calling you up asking for advice? 
 No, no, no, it's not like that. 
 I just... 
 Look. 
 You wouldn't be the first cop in this office to bang a call girl, okay? 
 What are you, lonely, bullman? You need to get laid? 
 I understand that, but you better not be doing something stupid like falling for this whore. 
 No. Nothing's going on. 
 Captain, it's... you know, I was just trying to help her out. 
 [Opens drawer] 
 [Dumps liquid] 
 Look... 
 I don't know what you want me to do. 
 You want me to put in a good word for this broad? 
 Yeah. Maybe. I... I don't know. 
 I just... you know, I'm curious, you know, how it works, you know, how she treats the girls and, you know, what kind of percentage she takes. 
 What kind of percentage? 
 What are you, her financial adviser? 
 No, no. [Scoffs] I just... you know, I... I kind of feel bad for her, so I just... I want to make sure she gets treated fair. 
 Fair? Fair? She's a hooker, Bull. 
 Fair exited her life a long time ago. 
 [Radio playing indistinctly] 
 Hey, do me a favor. When we get in there, I'll do the talking. 
 All right. 
 Let's go. Tony, take a walk. 
 Come on, let's go. Upstairs. 
 Hey, Moose. 
 Sorry to interrupt your lunch. 
 Vince, what is this? Who's this guy you're bringing down here? 
 We work together. 
 We never done it like this before, Vince. 
 I told you it wasn't always up to me, didn't I? 
 Come on, big man. 
 Stop your complaining. We're here to talk business. 
 Well, business is bad, like I told Vince last month. 
 Yeah. And what about the month before that, and every other month? 
 I've been on an unlucky streak. 
 It happens sometimes. Nature of the beast. 
 As I said, I had to shut down two of my crap games. 
 And plus, I got my three kids in private high schools and another three in college. 
 You have no idea how that adds up. But what are you gonna do? 
 You gotta get 'em a good education. 
 They're gonna get ahead in this world, am I right? 
 Yeah, you know, you're really breaking my heart, Paisan. 
 You're obviously a very dedicated family man, just like me. 
 I'm also sympathetic to your financial situation, given my meager salary. 
 Therefore, it really would be a shame if this had to get ugly today, and by "ugly" I mean locking your ass up. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy here. 
 Vince, who does this guy think he's talking to? 
 Sally, there's no reason to get emotional. 
 I'm not getting emotional, am I? 
 I'm just talking business. 
 So sit your fat ass down! 
 Now listen to me. This isn't complicated. 
 You've been doing this a long time. I know that. 
 That's right, I've been doing this a long time, like my father before me. 
 Then you know the rules! 
 We didn't mix 'em up on you all of a sudden! 
 And just like us and your father before you, you agreed to play by those rules, no? 
 So here's the deal... we want our money, we want it now. 
 If we don't get it, you're going to jail, and that is non-negotiable. 
 What if I don't have all of it? 
 Are you shittin' me, Sal? Didn't I warn you about this? 
 Do you really think I came down here today to get jerked around by you? 
 Now I'm walking out of here today with our money or with you. 
 It's your call. 
 [Exhales] 
 All right, I got 2 large, and that's all I got. 
 You can have it tonight. 
 Ah, Jesus Christ. Are you kidding me? 
 All right, asshole, up on your feet. 
 Vince, we're taking him. 
 Oh, Vince, talk to this guy! 
 We're done talking! You got my word! 
 Vince, I'll get it to youse tonight, on my word. 
 I'll even throw in a little extra. 
 Do you really think I got nothing better to do than chase your fat ass around again tonight? 
 Vince, talk to this guy. You have my word. 
 We don't need to take him, Terry. He'll have it tonight. 
 You're lucky you got a friend. Empty your pockets. 
 Do it, Sal. 
 Tonight! 
 [Bell jingles] 
 This is the last break we give that dago prick, all right? 
 Tell me you never cut those Irish assholes on the West Side a break. 
 No, not when it comes to money. 
 [Horns honking in distance] 
 [Coin clinks] 
 [Rotary dial whirring] 
 [Rings] 
 Trucking and storage. 
 Rusty, hey, it's me... Duffy. 
 What'd you find out, Duffy? 
 Word on Kane is he's gone. 
 Nobody's seen or heard from him or his greasy little sidekick Hopkins. 
 Frickin' cowards skipped town. 
 Yeah, hey, you mind if I ask, uh, what you wanted to talk to him about? 
 It's none of your goddamn business, you little sh1t. 
 You get in touch with me if you hear them coming back into town, you understand? 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolute. 
 If I hear anything, I'll be in touch. 
 [Slams phone] 
 So what do you wanna do? 
 Take out the rest of the crew. 
 Force that prick Kane to show his face. 
 And we're gonna start with Smitty. 
 Your father ain't gonna approve of that. 
 My father hasn't approved a thing I've done since my mother died giving birth to me. 
 Listen, Rusty, you go down this road, you gotta go all the way. 
 [Hits button] Talking about going all the way. 
 Like I told you, Uncle Red, after seven years in that shithole, I'm done waiting. 
 Don't worry about it. You did what you had to do. 
 If it happens again, you go to Joe Fish directly. 
 I know, I know, but Vince swears by his guy Tedesco. 
 Vince's relationship with him has always concerned me. 
 What also concerns me very much is that I don't trust that Latucci isn't stealing from us. 
 All right. I'll keep an eye on him. 
 Good. There's another matter I'd like to discuss with you. 
 Your buddy Bullman ever mention anything about this call girl he's helping out? 
 Call girl? No. 
 What did he say, and exactly how is he helping her? 
 He's... he's looking after her. 
 Did he says if he's banging this broad? 
 Why else would he give a sh1t about her? 
 [Huffs] You got any clue who it might be? 
 Yep. I got a pretty good idea. 
 She, uh, the kinda girl you might fall for? 
 Yeah, she's knockout who also claims to be a schoolteacher. 
 Oh, sh1t. He didn't fall for that one. 
 You might want to have a talk with him. 
 Are you kidding me? I got enough bullshit going on right now. 
 The last thing I need to worry about is bullman's love life. 
 Have the talk. 
 You don't want to get emotionally attached to one of those kinda girls, okay? 
 Trust me, I know. 
 [Vehicle approaches, horn honks] 
 [Engine turns off] 
 What do you say, dollface? 
 My Uncle's pissed at you, Vince. 
 First you arrest Sergio and then you threaten to arrest him? 
 Well, he was breaking the law. 
 Very funny. Look, I love your Uncle, but he's always trying to slip sh1t past us, and very often he succeeds. 
 This time, he didn't. 
 Come on, did you really have to bring that other cop down with you? 
 Yeah. He needed to be sent a message. 
 Besides, your Uncle didn't get arrested, Sergio's back on the street, and now everybody's happy again. 
 Not everybody. 
 Oh, are you not happy? 
 Maybe there's something I could do about that. 
 You feel like taking a drive? 
 Sure. Why not? 
 Get in. 
 [Engine starts] 
 You know, I was thinking about your situation, and I don't think you should go with the madam. 
 Why not? 
 Why should you cut her in on what you make? 
 You know they take like 30% of your money? 
 Yeah, but then I'm protected. 
 I won't have to worry about another creep like Mr. Smith. 
 I took care of him, didn't it? 
 You know, I got this crazy idea. 
 You know, I was thinking, you know, why don't I just look out for you? 
 Yeah, what kind of payment would you expect? 
 I don't want no money. It ain't like that. 
 Then what do you want? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe I just want to help you out. 
 You just want to help? 
 Sure. Why not? 
 Look, what do you say that next time let's meet somewhere else, all right? 
 Just, uh, call me if you need me. 
 Woman : ♪ You know ♪ 
♪ I love you ♪ 
 What are you doing getting involved in your Uncle's business, anyhow? 
 I should ask you the same question. 
 It's part of the job. It's what we do. 
 And I'm part of the family. 
 Maybe it's just what we do, too. 
 But you're a woman. 
 You shouldn't get caught up in this sh1t. 
 Why not? 
 Because it's dirty work, that's why not. 
 There's a lot of rough customers. 
 You could end up getting hurt. 
 I've grown up surrounded by it. 
 Besides, my Uncle doesn't deal with anything besides gambling. 
 He's too much of a softy for that other stuff. 
 What does your father think? 
 He never messes around with this sh1t. 
 He just runs his business and keeps his nose clean. 
 Yeah. Slaves away in that kitchen seven days a week. 
 You think that's what I want, too? 
 So, what? You want to become a mobster? 
 Maybe. 
 Unless something better comes along. 
 [Song continues on radio] 
 No. Vince. 
 What? 
 Don't. 
 You're a Saint all of a sudden? 
 You were just telling me you want to become a mobster. 
 What can I say? 
 There are certain laws I'll break, but sleeping with a married man ain't one of them. 
 All right, so then what was this about tonight? 
 You just wanted to enjoy my spectacular company, my incredible charm? 
 Yeah. 
 Something like that. 
 What's the latest with the Mr. O investigation? 
 We got nothing. And as much as I'd love to wish it was just a random act of violence, I'm Irish and therefore can't help but expect the worst. 
 Meaning what? 
 Meaning I think this asshole's murder might be the start of something bigger. 
 Tell me what you're thinking. 
 We had a double homicide the other night. 
 Two low-level soldiers who worked for Rusty Patton. 
 I'm thinking it was Mr. O's crew getting retribution. 
 But Mr. O worked with Patton. I don't get it. 
 I know, I know, but the last night I saw my Uncle, he told me him and his guys were thinking about making a move on the big guy. 
 I'm afraid Patton got wind of it, had my Uncle whacked. 
 Otherwise Patton would be hell-bent on trying to find my Uncle's killer, and instead he seems... indifferent. 
 If you are right, Terrance, that would not be good for us. 
 No. Tell me about it. 
 Why do you think I'm on my fourth Irish whiskey? 
 Make that your fifth. 
 All right, don't go taking it for a joyride. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Yeah, all right. 
 This was back then. 
 Here he is. 
 Hey, Davis. 
 Hey, Smitty. How are ya? 
 Hey, Tommy, what's going on? Rusty. Hey. 
 [Sniffs] Hey, good to see you guys. 
 You sure about that? 
 You don't look so happy. You look a little... nervous, actually. 
 Nervous? No. [Scoffs] Not at all. 
 That's a nice suit. 
 Isn't that a nice suit, Uncle Red? 
 You must be enjoying a new gig. 
 And the extra cash that goes with it, huh? 
 Yeah, you know, I'm just trying to do a good job for your father. 
 Is that right? 
 See, I thought the big guy was gonna give me Mr. O's operation. 
 Instead, he thought that you were the better man for the job. 
 You know, Rusty, I'm just trying to do what your father asks me to do. 
 Did my father ask you to kill Rogers? 
 O'Reilly? 
 What? What? 
 Me? 
 No, I don't... [Stammers] 
 [Exhales] I had nothing to do with that. 
 But your crew did, didn't they? 
 My crew? No. 
 That's not what I heard. 
 I heard it was that kid Kane. 
 [Breathes sharply] 
 He's not part of my crew. That's one of Mr. O's guys. 
 I... and I had to... I had to get rid of him 'cause the kid's batshit crazy. 
 You got rid of him? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? How'd you do that? 
 I-I told him I... you know, I told... 
 I told him I was done with him. 
 You got any idea where he is right now? 
 What do I look like, his mother? 
 What, you got a big mouth all of a sudden? 
 [Muffled grunting] 
 [Glasses and bottles clattering] 
 [Door locks] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Gasping] [Grunting] 
 [Grunting] 
 Come on, Rusty, I thought you was working out in the joint! 
 Shut up! 
 Freakin' Rusty, huh? [Laughs] 
 You should have seen him back when he was drinking. 
 [Grunts loudly] 
 [Exhales, panting] 
 [Exhales] 
 You think you can take my money, you piece of sh1t? 
 You think you can take my job? 
 [Panting] 
 [Laughs] 
 You're even crazier than I was at your age. 
 Oh, we're just getting started, Uncle Red. 
 You see, I'm gonna bite, chew, swallow, and sh1t out the entire big apple by the time I'm done. 
 And after we take the West Side, we're going after the guineas and we're gonna take the whole damn city. 
 All right, all right. Before we do that, I'm gonna go have a talk with Sully. 
 All right. 
 What? Jesus Christ, Rusty, I didn't think you were gonna kill him in here. 
 I thought you were gonna take him for a ride. 
 Change of plans. 
 Hey, Sully. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Let's just get this piece of sh1t outta here. 
 Help me. 
 What the hell, Rusty? 
 I can't get involved in this kind of sh1t! 
 Well, it's a little late for that, isn't it? 
 You know what, smart guy? Huh? 
 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 You take care of it yourself. 
 [Door slams] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Hello? 
 [Ice cubes rattle] 
 Yeah, he's right here. 
 Whose wife you think it is, mine or his? 
 50 bucks says it's his. 
 Neither. A guy named Battalina. 
 Tony B.? What's going on? 
 [Sighs] sh1t. 
 All right. Yeah. 
 I'll see you at the morgue in the morning. 
 My intuition was right. 
 Expect the worst.
