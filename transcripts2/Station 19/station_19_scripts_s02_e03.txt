 Previously on "Station 19"... 
 You are a surgeon. Save the life you can save. 
 Travis? Oh, my God. 
 Means we are getting you the hell out of this place! 
 Jack! Hey! Jack! 
 Something has changed. Maybe I've changed. 
 If a lieutenant spot opens up at the end of all this, I expect you to throw your hat in the ring. 
 See the tall guy over there from Station 23? 
 He was asking if you might be interested. 
 I'd like to introduce you all to the new captain of Station 19, Captain Robert Sullivan. 
 I'm moving out, Dad. What? 
 I'm gonna be at Maya's, okay? 
 You ever hang on to stuff you know you shouldn't? 
 Magazines. 
 Mementos. 
 Memories. 
 Even grudges. 
 We squirrel it all away for a rainy day. 
 But do we really need all that extra stuff? 
 It stacks up. 
 It takes a toll. 
 It can wear you down. 
 It shuts out the light, and it hangs over you like a cloud you can't shake. 
 That clutter's toxic and also highly flammable. 
 So, on behalf of firefighters everywhere, please, clean house. 
 Start fresh. 
 Let the sun shine in. 
 Morning. 
 It's morning. 
 Hello. Are you awake? 
 Hi. 
 Hello. 
 You don't remember my name. 
 Dave. 
 David. It's David. 
 I know you probably won't believe me, but... 
 I swear I don't usually do stuff like this. 
 Me neither. 
 Though I won't say I've been disappointed, David... in the things you don't... usually do... that you've been doing... and doing. 
 You got up early... to put things on my shelves. 
 Our shelves. 
 I live here, too, now, and you're also up early. 
 Yeah, I had to clear my head. Are those... 
 Textbooks, some fire-safety manuals. 
 And I have some photos, too. 
 This shelf looked empty and sad. 
 No, not sad empty... Intentionally empty. 
 Negative space. Mnh. 
 You're still stewing about Sullivan. 
 I'm not stewing. I am organizing. Ah. 
 I'm putting a stamp on my new home. 
 Yes, I am very well-versed in what triggers you to compulsively organize. 
 You and I know this has nothing to do with you feeling at home. 
 I thought I had done the hard part already when I got up the courage to tell my dad I wanted to move out. Yeah, I'm still actually a little surprised you did that. I had to. 
 I can't start any new chapters if I'm still living under his roof. 
 I want to feel good and home and happy and free and... 
 This shelf still looks sad. 
 Hey. I've got news. 
 I've come to share, as is our tradition. 
 It's only a tradition if it's happened before. 
 You have a key? 
 I let you house-sit one time. 
 Guess who I woke up with this morning. 
 No. Don't guess. 
 I'm gonna tell you. 
 Mr. Station 23. 
 And before you get started on his 23 moniker... 
 I just have to say I really don't approve of firefighters dating each other. 
 Kidding. 
 Go get that. 
 This is a new side of you, Herrera. 
 I like it. You never crack jokes. 
 I crack jokes. 
 You were just angry-shelving because you were upset about something Sullivan said last shift. 
 You don't exactly wear life loosely. 
 We love you and your earnestness, anyway. 
 I am not always earnest. 
 I'm... easy. And breezy. 
 Except you're kind of the opposite of that. 
 You don't ease. You don't breeze. 
 I can breeze. 
 Oh, maybe ease and breeze this mess into your room. 
 That was very convincing. 
 Hey. 
 Thanks for the last-minute ride. 
 I'm almost ready. 
 This is where you live? 
 Uh, yeah. Let me grab my jacket. 
 With the water and the deck and the view? 
 How come I've never been here before? 
 I kind of... I don't have a lot of people over. 
 But why? We're always hanging at that bar across from the hospital. 
 Why... Why don't we ever hang here? 
 I don't know. I-I guess I just kind of, you know, keep some things to myself. 
 We should get going. 
 Kind of selfish, really, keeping all this water for yourself. 
 It's not my water. 
 Is... Is that a kayak? 
 Don't I owe you a punch from the night of the skyscraper? 
 Now is a good a time as any. 
 All right, all right, I get it. Mm-hmm. 
 You're greedy with your paradise. 
 I would be, too. 
 Oh, damn. 
 Sullivan needs me for some kind of special meeting before shift, so... 
 Come on! 
 We gotta go! 
 How do you feel about that drain-pipe call last shift? 
 You feel good? 
 Well, we did save the kid, so... 
 Because I think that rescue revealed a stunning lack of cooperation between the Seattle Fire Department and PD. 
 So you're going on a PD ride-along today. 
 And when you're done, you can share your insight with the station on what it's really like to walk in an officer's shoes. 
 I'd rather spend today with 19, sir, walking in my own shoes. 
 Yeah, I expect you to conduct yourself with respect. 
 Stay safe. Stay in your lane. 
 And don't get shot. 
 I think your ride's here. 
 Really? 
 You're gonna park there? 
 I'm not staying long. 
 You're blocking our driveway, which means you're blocking our trucks. 
 What if there's an emergency? 
 What if we need to pull out of here? 
 You can't park there. 
 'Cause it's not allowed? 'Cause it's against the law? 
 Yeah. Great. I'll be sure to write myself a ticket. 
 You getting in or what? 
 You're my ride-along. 
 So, you literally just pulled in here to mess with me? 
 Yeah. 
 Today should be fun. 
 Wait. Why is Jack leaving before shift with Ryan? 
 You know, I bet they have a lot to bond over... 
 Saving lives, risking lives... how you stomped on both their hearts. 
 You know what I've been thinking about giving a try? 
 Kayaking. 
 You know, shake up my exercise routine, get out on the water. 
 Only thing is finding a spot with a dock and a kayak and a place to clean up. 
 Jack told you about my place. 
 He texted me. He texted everybody, actually. 
 'Sup, Houseboat? 
 And we will be waterfront day-drinking when this shift is over. 
 What are you doing? 
 Getting my breakfast. 
 It don't need all that. 
 Okay, must I spell it out? 
 Can't you recognize the swagger when you're looking at the swagger? 
 Ah, hey! 
 Yeah, she did! 
 Hey, Montgomery! Travis, man. 
 What's going on? 
 'Bout time you got back to work. 
 Feels good. Oh, man. 
 Back in uniform. 
 Feels like I haven't seen you in forever. 
 Yeah. Things got busy, so... 
 Yeah. No. Of course. 
 Uh, so, what was the high-fiving about? 
 What did I miss? Uh, you know, sorry to run. 
 I've got chores. 
 Oh, hey, hey, Montgomery, did you hear that Miller is gonna invite everybody over to his houseboat? 
 What? No. 
 No. Jack started that rumor. 
 I did hear you have a deck. 
 Yeah, so... 
 Excuse me. A deck with a grill? 
 Yes. Okay. Hear me out. 
 Hey, I was, uh... I was just knocking. 
 I heard. 
 I was ignoring you because I didn't want to be disturbed. 
 Sh-Should I come back later? 
 You've disturbed me now. 
 Right. Uh... 
 So, um... 
 I know you think I'm some kind of a, uh, tourist who just goes from job to job, and you probably think that's why I broke protocol at the skyscraper or why I burnt my hand last shift. 
 If I put myself in your shoes, I'd probably be asking myself, you know, "Why bother investing in a guy like that?" 
 I wasn't... exactly. 
 Good. I am now. 
 Look. I just wanted to assure you... 
 I love this job. I have no intention of leaving. 
 And I know I can learn a lot from you, so any kind of training exercises you want to throw my way... 
 Or anything at all, really... I-I'm ready. 
 I want to dive in, sir. 
 Captain. 
 Anything else? 
 No, sir. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, um... 
 Okay. 
 Why does everyone come out of Sullivan's office looking sadder than when they went in? 
 He likes to make people squirm. 
 It's like a sport for him. 
 I mean, something in his past must have turned him like that. 
 Where'd he even come from? 
 Captained a crew in Montana the last several years, before that, Seattle FD, training facilities, lived here most of his adult life, wasn't born in Seattle, tho... 
 What? I woke up early, and I was pinned beneath a very tall man-blanket. 
 The only obvious thing to do in that scenario is cyber-stalk. 
 And you cyber-stalked Sullivan and not your man-blanket? 
 Oh, no, I looked him up, too. 
 Just turns out man-blanket's a little boring. 
 All right, it... It still doesn't explain it. 
 And how the hell was that guy the department's first choice to captain 19? 
 They could've at least promoted a woman. 
 I wasn't the first choice. 
 The department was angling for a female captain, but the number of women firefighters in Seattle is, sadly, declining. 
 And the woman Chief Ripley earmarked for the position... 
 She ruined her own chances. 
 So if you're genuinely still curious as to why I have this job, Herrera, I have you to thank. 
 He has it out for me. 
 And you keep giving him ammo to use against you. 
 He keeps lurking. 
 And you keep overstepping, so... tit for tat or whatever. 
 Rest in peace, easy, breezy Andy. 
 We hardly knew thee. 
 Hey. 
 Is everything okay with Vic? 
 Does she seem a little off to you? 
 Not really. 
 Hey, hey, hey, careful. 
 That's heavy. 
 I just... I-I don't know. 
 I-I guess I was feeling a little weird around her earlier. 
 She seems pretty happy to me, you know, with everything that's been going on. 
 Yeah. Right, sure, of course, except, no, I don't know. 
 What's going on? 
 What? She... She didn't tell you? 
 Aren't you usually the first person she talks to about everything? 
 I thought I was. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 Uh, well, if she didn't tell you, then it's not really my place, so, um... never mind. 
 I'm just gonna go get more hoses. 
 Tell me what? Hey! 
 Here's the deal. 
 This is... basically a pretend shift for me. 
 We'll go through the motions, call it a day. 
 We can just get doughnuts if you want. 
 You guys do that, right? 
 Rule number one... During this ride-along, you will, at all times, stay in the car, no matter what. 
 You do not get out of this car for the next 12 hours. 
 12 hours? 
 Our shifts are 24. 
 Sounds so nice, working a half day. 
 Well, the city doesn't put beds in our cars like you get at the firehouse. 
 Cops work all shift, patrolling, not watching TV, waiting for a cat to get stuck in a tree. 
 Yeah. We don't do that. 
 And we don't eat doughnuts. 
 Today, we have to stay on high alert. 
 Our assignment is traffic stops. 
 High alert? For speeding tickets? 
 Traffic stops are the most unpredictable component of this job. 
 You're approaching an unknown vehicle. 
 You never, ever know who's waiting inside. 
 We take it seriously because it's serious. 
 Copy that. 
 Broken taillights are no joke. 
 I'm learning so much already. 
 Stop! Don't come any closer! 
 Sir, place your hands where I can see them, please. 
 Good. 
 Now, open the door slowly, and step out of the vehicle. 
 No. 
 Sir, I won't say it again. 
 Open the door, and step out of the vehicle. 
 No, no, I-I-I can't. I'm... I'm not... 
 I'm not wearing any pants. 
 Uh, I s... I spilled my latte, and my pants are dry-clean-only, so I took them off. 
 But everything was still burning, so I took my boxers off, too, because it hurt. 
 It... It... It... It really burned, and i-it still does. 
 And I know that I was speeding, but I just wanted to get home and... 
 What's it look like? 
 The burn. 
 Is it, uh, pink, with swelling? 
 Uh... no. 
 Is it red, blisters, a little scaly? 
 Yeah, more like that. 
 Okay, that's a second-degree partial-thickness burn. 
 You need to get to an emergency room right away. 
 Officer Tanner will provide you with a police escort. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 What? I stayed in the car. 
 Hey, when, uh... When you're done, do you think you'd have a minute to talk? 
 Sure. 
 Okay, good. 
 Maybe 'cause it's my first day back, or I guess it's possible that I could be reading into stuff, but it feels a little like you don't want to talk to me or, actually, that you aren't talking to me. 
 I thought we were waiting until I was done. 
 I know. Sorry. It can wait. 
 There's nothing to talk about. You sure? 
 'Cause it feels like you're talking to other people about stuff and... 
 And nothing. 
 I told you... There's nothing to talk about. 
 So, now we're running this poor lady's plates because her sticker's a month out of date? 
 You know, why don't I just take you back to the station? 
 I can tell today was a mistake. 
 I feel like we're getting off on the wrong foot. 
 I'm trying to let go of petty stuff, and this stuff between you and me, it's petty. 
 We should let it go. 
 You know what I'm talking about. 
 I mean Andy. 
 We were both in competition for her, and now we aren't. 
 You feel me? 
 I don't feel anything, except annoyed that I don't get to do my real work today because of you. 
 I thought you said traffic stops are real work. 
 I thought you said they were the realest of the real work. 
 You see that right there? 
 Same snark, same Jack. 
 I'm not buying this whole "Kumbaya" act from you. 
 It's not an act. Let's stop talking now. 
 You really gonna be like this? 
 I'm not above arresting you. 
 Dad. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Brought you a housewarming gift. 
 It's a dead plant. 
 Yeah. 
 I can't keep it alive. Here. Take it. 
 You have more of a green thumb. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Of course. Why wouldn't everything be okay? 
 Don't be ridiculous. My life is full. 
 My fridge is full. I am great. 
 Don't be so nosy. 
 Everything okay with you? 
 Yeah, of course. Everything is perfect... 
 New place, new outlook, feeling good, easy, breezy, totally. 
 Hey! There he is. 
 How's retirement? 
 I'm not retired, regardless of what Sullivan thinks. 
 I'm on extended medical leave. 
 There's a difference between being on leave and leaving. 
 I'm not leaving. I'm on leave. Got it? 
 I'm nodding yes, but, no, not really. 
 Reported ceiling collapse for Engine 19, Ladder 19, and Rescue 19 at 213... 
 Deadline's coming up. 
 Deadline, sir? 
 For the next round of Lieutenant applications. 
 I've been waiting for yours. 
 You know, when Chief Ripley briefed me on 19, he said you were a prime candidate for a promotion. 
 Now, you seemed interested in more women running the department. 
 That can't happen if people like you don't apply. 
 Right. 
 You're hesitating. 
 Is it because you and Herrera are friends? 
 You don't want to step on her toes? 
 Andy and I support each other. We don't step. 
 Okay. It's true. 
 I understand. That's good. 
 You know, at some point, though, you may be ready to move away from being a cheerleader and just start being a leader. 
 Just an outsider's observation. 
 I'll keep an eye out for your application. 
 We were caught completely by surprise. 
 Plaster. The whole ceiling above us was cracking. 
 Look, I mean, it's... It's an old building. 
 We've had a few bad leaks lately, but this is different. 
 The spot on the ceiling was huge. 
 And all we could think of is... 
 Evelyn. This is her place. 
 She's lived in the apartment above us since before we moved in... She's been here forever. 
 Look. She doesn't get out all that much. Mnh-mnh. 
 We tried calling her on her phone. There was no answer. 
 But we could hear her answering machine through the floor. 
 Seattle Fire Department! We're doing a wellness check. 
 We just got worried that something could really be wrong, especially since her floor is starting to give way. 
 That part's probably just a water leak. 
 It would take a lot of weight to compromise an entire ceiling. 
 That didn't sound good. 
 We need to know for sure if she's in there, and we need to know now. 
 Let's break this lock, please. 
 Looks like something's blocking the door. 
 Let me try... 
 That's more than a water leak. 
 I don't think we should keep forcing the door like that. 
 Let's get the structural engineers out here. 
 And let's turn off the utilities, too. 
 Hughes, check if you can see anything at all. 
 Hello. 
 Is... Is someone out there? 
 Evelyn, this is the Seattle Fire Department. 
 Are you all right? Are you able to move? 
 Not exactly. 
 This is Miller with Station 19. 
 I'm gonna need structural engineers on my location for evaluation ASAP. 
 There's stuff stacked all the way up to the ceiling in there, like a wall of stuff. If leaks and chronic water damage are rotting away the wooden floor joists... 
 Then the apartment may be buckling under the weight from all that stuff. 
 You didn't want to mention that your neighbor's a hoarder? 
 She never invites us into her place. 
 We've always had her over to ours ever since her husband died. 
 Are you saying that her apartment is about to fall into ours? 
 That's highly unlikely. 
 Miller, head back to the truck and get the support beams for downstairs. 
 Hughes, Montgomery, begin an evac down there, as well, just in case. 
 Sir, I can handle the support beams. 
 You have your orders. 
 Evelyn? My name's Andy. 
 Ma'am, you mentioned you can't move. 
 Is that because you're injured? 
 I feel so stupid. 
 I-I tripped, and some boxes fell on top of me. 
 We can't risk opening the door more. 
 It could cause an avalanche on our vic. 
 Do you have any other medical issues we should know about? 
 Did you hurt anything else in your fall? 
 Well, it's... it's just... It's a little hard for me to catch my breath, I guess. 
 My chest hurts. 
 But my doctor, he said that that might happen. 
 Your doctor? 
 Yeah. Um, I had a heart operation a few weeks ago. 
 Chest pain, shortness of breath. 
 She could be having a cardiac episode right now. 
 If she has any underlying heart disease, with all those boxes of who knows what compressing her chest... 
 We need to get in there. 
 If you've got a problem, say something. 
 I don't have a problem. 
 Who said what now? 
 Nothing. Nothing. 
 What are we t... Okay. What's wrong with you two? 
 Nothing. 
 Okay, are you guys being weird because I never invited you to my houseboat? 
 Look, I like my privacy, and I like my furniture. 
 And I live with both of you at the station, and I know none of you use coasters. 
 Seattle Fire Department! 
 I need you to evacuate immediately. 
 This floor is getting weaker every second, and so is she. 
 We need to get in there before it's too late. 
 We won't all fit through that door. And we shouldn't. 
 In my opinion, adding more weight in there is a bad idea. 
 I recommend we wait for the engineers. 
 They're on their way. We shouldn't go in blind. 
 I'm not proposing the whole team goes in. 
 All it takes is one. Warren, you're up. 
 Me? You said you wanted to dive in. 
 Time to dive. 
 Respectfully, Captain, Evelyn's alert and responsive. 
 We can wait for the engineers. 
 We got a floor on the verge of collapse and a vic with a heart problem. 
 These kinds of rescues require specialized training and experience. 
 Warren has never been in an environment like this. 
 An environment like this, meaning... 
 Look, if the room's filled with excessive debris, you can't get to a wall. You have nothing to guide you. 
 It's nearly impossible to navigate. 
 Bishop... what do you think? 
 What? 
 Well, I'd like to hear your opinion on this. 
 Should we send Warren in or wait? 
 Every second that we wait, the more likely the floor could collapse or that her heart could give out. 
 I think we should get someone in there to get her out here where we can treat her safely, but... 
 But what? 
 I don't think it should be Warren. 
 I think we should send in Herrera. 
 She's the lightest, and she has the most experience. 
 Smart. I agree. 
 Herrera, grab a portable sked stretcher. 
 Is there a problem, Lieutenant? 
 No, sir. 
 Good. 
 Hey. 
 I'm so sorry. I just... 
 Daddy, are we going to be late for Jojo's party? 
 Oh, no, don't worry, Lindy. 
 I just have to talk to this nice police officer, and then I'm gonna get you to the party. 
 Look. She's been looking forward to this party for weeks. 
 Apparently, there's a... A bubble show or something? 
 You get to stand in a plastic tub, and they make a giant bubble all around you. 
 Can we go now? Sorry. 
 She gets a little nervous when we're late for things. 
 Maybe it runs in the family. 
 I promise to work as quickly as possible. 
 Would you mind turning the car off? 
 Oh, no, of course not. 
 License and registration, please. 
 Right. Sorry. 
 Just gonna have to check these out, and I'll have you on your way. 
 What's wrong? 
 This is Officer Tanner, unit 1-8. 
 I believe I have a possible child abduction in progress. 
 Wait, what? Are you serious? 
 Perp's I.D. reads "Gregory Dougal," driving a 2007 Accord, stopped going 60 miles an hour on Alder Street. 
 Child's first name is Lindy. Please advise. 
 Watch yourself, Herrera. 
 Just grab the vic and get back here. 
 Copy. 
 You sure this is a kidnapping? 
 I think it's possible. 
 When he gripped the wheel, I saw a wedding-ring tan. 
 Probably means the ring was recently removed. 
 There's a duffel bag in the front seat. 
 Things look like they were stuffed inside quickly, including a toothbrush and some kid's pajamas. 
 You don't need pajamas if you're going to an afternoon birthday party, which is where he said they were headed. 
 And his GPS screen is clearly programmed for the airport. 
 Okay, but there could be all sorts of reasons for all those things. 
 Absolutely. 
 But there's no way I'm not gonna check it out. 
 So, what do we do? 
 We stall, wait for confirmation, and hope he doesn't get suspicious. 
 Bishop, head down to the Aid Car. 
 We're gonna need the gurney and a cardiac monitor. 
 On it. 
 And you may want to turn your radio down. 
 The volume's turned up all the way. 
 I-I must have bumped it when I geared up. 
 You know, you surprised me. 
 I did, sir? 
 Siding with me over your friend. 
 Tough call in the heat of the moment. 
 Bold move. 
 I was siding with the victim. 
 Thought it was the best way to save her. 
 That's it. 
 Well, that's what a good lieutenant's supposed to do. 
 The floor feels spongy. 
 It's severely water-damaged. 
 It can't hold up all this weight. 
 
 
 
 Copy. 
 Evelyn? 
 Evelyn, can you hear me? 
 I can hear you. 
 It's me... Andy. I'm on my way to you. 
 Evelyn, I need you to keep talking so I can find you. 
 Say anything you want. 
 I just need to hear where I'm going. 
 I'm so embarrassed. 
 This place is such a mess. 
 It's okay, Evelyn. 
 How's your chest pain? Is it worse? 
 It's not better. 
 You know, I-I kept a very tidy house when Jeffrey was alive. 
 It didn't seem to matter much, keeping things up, after he was gone. 
 Jeffrey... Is that your husband? 
 Yeah. He always knew what was important for us to keep and what wasn't. 
 He was always so good about that kind of thing. 
 I can never decide. 
 So, you keep everything, then? 
 Oh, well, I don't really like talking about myself. 
 Okay. That's okay. 
 We can talk about anythi... 
 Herrera! You all right?! 
 Herrera? Do you copy? 
 Come in. 
 Amber alert issued... Custodial interference. 
 Child's father is the confirmed perpetrator. 
 Additional units en route. 
 You called it. 
 Andy? Andy? 
 I'm here! I'm okay. It's okay. 
 You still need me to talk? 
 Yes, if you can. 
 You sound louder. I can tell I'm getting closer. 
 It's just... I'm having... a hard time trying to breathe. 
 Don't collapse. Please don't collapse. 
 Hey, there. 
 So, let's check out your heart first, okay? 
 You match your voice. 
 I'll bet you can put anyone at ease. 
 My husband Jeffrey... 
 He... he was like that. 
 Warren? 
 Patient presents with muffled heart sounds and a very low B.P. 
 Can you see her neck veins? 
 Yeah. They're distended. 
 It's worse than we thought. 
 Sounds like cardiac tamponade. 
 When everything fell on her, my guess is that the trauma to her chest caused fluid to accumulate in the sac around her heart. 
 Now it's being constricted and... 
 Herrera, we can't wait for you to get her out. 
 You have to treat her now. 
 I don't feel... very good. 
 So, what do I do? 
 You, um... 
 You have to remove the fluid from the pericardial sac. 
 You need to find the largest needle you can in your med kit. 
 Okay, Evelyn, I need to stick a very big needle under your rib cage, okay? 
 You need to pierce the sac around the heart without stabbing the heart itself. 
 Then drain the blood out. 
 That... That sounds really quite terrible. 
 So, why are we just sitting here? 
 Why don't you arrest this guy? 
 I have a civilian in my car instead of my partner. 
 I need to wait for backup. 
 Okay, but there is a kid in that car that could be in danger. 
 It's because there's a kid. 
 Believe me, all I can think about is that kid and what she's going through, what she's about to go through. 
 I just... 
 Right now, her father's calm, so we stay calm, and she stays safe. 
 We just... 
 We have to wait for backup. 
 Backup better hurry. 
 Now, I don't have any way to put you out or to numb the area, so, Evelyn, I'm so sorry, but this is gonna hurt. 
 I have rheumatoid arthritis in every finger. 
 I've outlived my husband. 
 I'm sure I've felt worse. 
 You know, you should get out of here, dear. 
 Look at this place. 
 No. We'll both get out of here once I make sure you keep breathing. 
 I'm sure you have people who would care if you didn't make it out. 
 No one much is gonna miss me. 
 And maybe my heart's telling us something. 
 Maybe it's just giving out. 
 Jeffrey's did. 
 He knew his moment. 
 He looked me in the eye, and... and he... he knew it was his time. 
 I'm staying. 
 Walk me through it, Warren. 
 Find the space between the fifth and sixth intercostals. 
 Got it. 
 Now, when you're ready, insert the needle at a 45-degree angle, and move it towards the left shoulder. 
 How do I know when to stop? 
 You'll hit a little resistance. 
 That's the pericardial sac. 
 Just push through it, but... but not too far. 
 You don't want to hit the heart muscle. 
 You kind of just have to... feel your way. 
 Feel my way? 
 Feel my way. 
 If this is my time, maybe I'll see my Jeffrey again. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. I'll be okay. 
 Unfortunately, my computer is taking a while to check your license. 
 It should only be a couple more minutes. 
 Uh-huh. O-Okay. 
 Listen to me very carefully. 
 If you do what I think you're about to do, it won't end well. 
 There will be a chase. 
 You'd be putting your life on the line, but, worse, also your daughter's. 
 You won't get away. 
 Eventually, we'll catch up. We always catch up, at which point, you will have sealed your fate. 
 You would never see your daughter again. 
 The only way to keep being part of her life right now is to stop while you can. 
 Let go of that wheel, and turn off the ignition. 
 Please just turn the car off. 
 Okay, maybe it was a mistake. I can go in. 
 Maybe I can get her out. 
 Where the hell are the structural engineers? 
 Herrera! 
 The floor is gonna collapse any minute! 
 Incoming! Need some help! 
 Hello. 
 Good. Good to go. We got you. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Get her out of there! 
 Herrera! 
 Pull. Pull. 
 You don't understand. 
 I'm a really great dad. 
 But my ex's lawyer just keeps pushing and pushing. 
 You don't want to lose her. 
 Thank God you're okay. We were so worried. 
 About me? Of course about you. 
 We are just so glad that you're all right. 
 I'm sorry. I, uh... 
 I think I just ruined your apartment. 
 All that really matters is that you didn't fall through the floor with everything else. 
 The structural engineers have arrived. 
 Just in time to fix the barn door after the horses have gotten out. 
 Warren. 
 Good work today, talking Herrera through the procedure. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Coming? 
 She would have died. 
 If I had been making the call, I would have waited, and she would have died. 
 Well, I guess it's good it didn't go that way, then. 
 Hi, Mommy. 
 Thank you so much for looking after her. 
 Thank you. 
 His name is Jack. 
 He puts out fires. 
 Thank you... That's right. 
 Jack, God, so much. 
 If you hadn't... 
 Who knows what could have happened to her if you weren't here. You know, it was... 
 You know, it was actually Officer Tanner who... 
 Bye. 
 Sorry, man. You really deserved the victory lap on this one. 
 It's okay. 
 I'm used to it. 
 What do you mean? 
 When people see a fire engine in their rearview mirror, they slow down, move over, and get out of the way... to make room for the heroes. 
 When they see me in their rearview mirror, at best, they're annoyed. 
 At worst, they're scared. 
 Yeah, that's tough. 
 Did you eat? Yeah? 
 Some days, though, it's anything but. 
 I love you. 
 I should take you back. 
 Am I losing my instincts? What? 
 I would have made a completely different call today. 
 I feel like I don't know what the hell I'm doing anymore. 
 You want my opinion? Yes. 
 I mean, even though it blew your mind earlier that Sullivan might want it? 
 No, no, no, I was just... I mean, I-I was surprised you agreed with him. 
 Instead of blindly agreeing with you? 
 No. I was right. 
 My call was the right call. 
 Yes, I know. 
 Maya, I get it. I screwed up. 
 I keep screwing up. 
 I don't know if it's Sullivan, that he just gets under my skin, or what it is. 
 I don't know. Yeah. Me either. 
 Enter. 
 I won't be long. 
 I wanted to let you know that I just submitted my Lieutenant's application. 
 It should be in your inbox. 
 I look forward to reviewing it. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 I can handle these myself. 
 I know. I thought I'd help. 
 I don't need help. 
 Okay, Vic, hey, what gives? 
 What's going on? 
 Nothing. All I said is I don't need help. 
 You have been weird like this all day. 
 You say that there's nothing to talk about when clearly there is. 
 No, there isn't. 
 I've barely even seen you. 
 It's been six weeks, and I've seen you maybe twice. 
 So, what, are you mad I didn't visit more? 
 Nope. I'm not mad. 
 But I think that you are, and I don't know why. 
 All right, man, I'm busy, and Sullivan's got this giant list... 
 You're busy? Of chores for us... 
 This is me! Vic, it's me and you. 
 Please talk to me! Oh, okay, you and me? 
 Yes! You and me! Me and you? 
 All right, fine. You told Warren to let you die! 
 You told him, a rookie, who's gonna do whatever you tell him to do, to leave you bleeding out all alone where no one would find you. 
 Vic... Except I did find you. 
 And I dragged your ass out of there. 
 I watched you bleed out right in front of me, floor after floor after floor. 
 And so you're mad at me for almost dying? 
 That's what this is?! No, you... you quit! 
 You quit on Warren, and you quit on life... and you quit on me. 
 You quit on me. 
 Enough! We're not doing this here! 
 If you need professional advice, there's an FD Peer Support program at the Civic Center every week. 
 Take it there. 
 Don't be bringing your distractions and your baggage into my house on my time. 
 Understood? 
 Yes, sir. It won't happen again. 
 Don't be this plant. 
 Excuse me? 
 Look, I don't want you living here all alone, feeling like I'm too busy or that you don't have anybody. 
 Don't waste away on me, okay, without light or food, collecting piles of stuff till you're trapped in a prison of your own making with no way out. 
 You have a way out. 
 I'm still your daughter, even if I don't live here. 
 Don't be this plant. 
 Everything all right, m'ija? 
 Was I ever... easy or breezy? 
 Have I always needed to be right, to take things so seriously? 
 You were breezy... before your mom died. 
 I'm just... feeling a little lost, I guess. 
 Me, too. 
 It's strange not having you here. 
 I won't say it isn't. 
 But I'm not taking back that ugly plant. 
 I wonder where he's going. 
 Well, when he dropped by earlier, he said... 
 Wait. Ryan drops by here now? Mm-hmm. 
 Anyway, when he dropped by... he mentioned something about grabbing a beer or something tonight. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Mm-hmm. With Gibson. 
 Sometimes it's easier to hold on to things than it is to share them because sharing means opening up. 
 See what I mean? 
 It means letting people in. 
 Why would you keep all this water to yourself? 
 Again, it's not my water. 
 So, I guess the ride-along went well since you invited Tanner and yourself over like this. 
 For a second there, I thought I was going on my first real car chase. 
 Hey. Use a coaster. 
 I'm just glad everything ended well. 
 That was a tricky situation. 
 It could've gone so much worse. I hear that. 
 You should've seen the apartment we were at. 
 Would you get your feet off the table? 
 People eat off of that thing. 
 Does it ever stick with you? 
 The part that could've gone worse... 
 Do you ever, uh, have trouble shaking it? 
 It means exposing the things that hurt us, embarrass us, haunt us. 
 I try not to bring it home with me. 
 Yeah. 
 That's why so many of us try to hide the things that scare us. 
 We hoard them away. 
 Hey, man, you okay? 
 Trouble is, if you're not careful... 
 You kidding? I'm great. 
 Just pissed Tanner didn't let me play with his siren. 
 Man, you got your own sirens in your fire trucks. 
 Could have let me flash 'em once. Mm-hmm. 
 All that baggage... 
 It can crush you.
