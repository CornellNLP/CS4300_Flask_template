 You have cancer, Dad. 
 Were you neglecting to tell me? 
 I'm promoting Andrea to Lieutenant. 
 The two of you will be in running for Captain. 
 Congratulations on your recent promotion, Herrera. 
 - Thank you. 
 - I remember what it took to earn my brass. 
 There was nobody helping me out, that's for sure. 
 - ANDY: Oh, I'm ready. 
 - JACK: No, you're not. 
 - For what? 
 - For me. To crush you. 
 WOMAN: We did face death. 
 Yeah. [CHUCKLES] 
 I've never gotten that close before. 
 This suits you... running things.

 I was wondering if you might be able to help me. 
 JJ? 
 We got to get out of here. Right now!

 ANDY:  There's a thing we do in firefighting   called "reading smoke." 
 You watch the smoke billow in and out,   dance around and study every puff, every wisp. 
 This ice cream is gonna look dead-ass cool at the party. 
 Mom and Dad said we can't have anybody over while they're gone. 
 You want to impress Sydney B., right? 
 And the rest of the Science Club? 
 Freezing with nitro will do that. 
 Trust your big sis. We'll be fine. 
 You have to understand how the smoke moves 
 if you want to contain the fire beneath it. 
 Because a lack of containment in our line of work...   is a recipe for disaster.

 Stuff can be replaced. 
 My original "Purple Rain" album signed by Prince himself is not stuff. 
 It is everything. 
 And you're not the boss of me. I can go back in. 
 Hey. You're not risking suffocation.

 I know it didn't start at blue fire, since I was clearly the one doing the crushing there. 
 Oh! Listen to that smack-talk.

 Or "we almost got it on but got interrupted 
 by the alarm" smack talk? 
 Or "we're really confused because we're in competition but just drove through blue fire which was really hot, but we still haven't talked about that engagement ring hanging over our heads yet" sma...

 Evidence there's still alarm on the top floor. 
 Smoke was visible on ceiling inspection. 
 I think the origin is somewhere in the attic. 
 Looks to be pretty by-the-book.

 Nope.

 He says plumbers were fusing pipes in the attic. 
 I inspected this building a couple weeks back.

 Oh, I don't have to kiss up. 
 My crushing speaks for itself.

 Warren, tell me why we vent the roof of structure fires. 
 Uh, ventilation pulls the fire up and out of the building, preventing air from fueling the fire inside. 
 That means less spread, less damage.

 They pay you for that, yes?

 I'm not skipping half of them on your whim. 
 - So, do you want us to start cutting? 
 - Yes, yeah, start cutting! 
 Look, if the heat hole works on its own, it'll preserve way more structure overall than jumping right to the strips. 
 We're gonna end up there anyway.
