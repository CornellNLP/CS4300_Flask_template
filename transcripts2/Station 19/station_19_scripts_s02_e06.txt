 RYAN: If my dad's back, he's up to something. 
 I need someone that I can trust to tell me if I should trust him. 
 You want me to sit down with your dad with you? 
 Do you want to yell at me? 
 Go ahead. 
 But don't kick Bishop around. 
 I used to get night terrors. 
 Move in. 
 Did Ripley just wave at you? 
 Yeah. 
 So? 
 I need a break from our marriage. 
 BEN: I guess I'll just go.

 highly overrated.

 - It's not a scratch. 
 Oh, just patch me up.

 Also, a head CT wouldn't hurt.

 We can't treat you properly  if you won't allow me to do an exam. 
 Let's just take him in. 
 They can assess him there. 
 No! 
 No hospitals. 
 So, you're declining our professional recommendation  and refusing to go to the hospital? 
 Maybe you should tell Ryan not to come.
