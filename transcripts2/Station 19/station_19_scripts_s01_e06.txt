 Previously on Station 19. 
 I don't have some fear of fire, don't be ridiculous. 
 That I want more. I still do. 
 I saw Jack shirt on the ground outside the captain's bedroom. 
 I know. 
 For the past few months, we've been seeing each other. 
 Is one of you gonna leave? 
 No, because we broke up. 
 You are getting sicker. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Have you ever noticed that you never see firefighters working alone? 
 So, I have some news. 
 Oh. Something good? 
 We use the buddy system: work in sync, work in pairs. 
 Trust your partner. 
 Yeah. I got offered a job in New York. 
 And I'm thinking about taking it. 
 I don't know. 
 It just feels like there's a professional ceiling in Seattle, but when in New York, you know, the sky's the limit. 
 That way, you never get left all alone. 
 There could be other reasons to stay in Seattle. 
 I thought you'd be a little bit excited for me, Piper. 
 Sorry. 
 I am. I'm just surprised. 
 That's great. 
 You'll love it. Yeah. 
 But, Finley, I... 
 Oh! Ohh! 
 Something should do something about those damn potholes! 
 Alone leaves you vulnerable. 
 Alone leaves you exposed. 
 And while, at first, that might not seem like that big a deal... if it happens often enough... it's bound to catch up to you. 
 So, you just ran. From Ryan's front porch. 
 Like a stalker. Not a stalker. 
 A person who thought she knew what she wanted to say, but at the last minute changed her mind too late because doorbell, so I hid in the bushes and said nothing and just... watched him go back inside. 
 Hmm. Like a stalker. 
 Look, my dad'll want to eat cheese steaks today with everyone else. 
 Don't let him. Make him eat this. 
 Okay, I don't know if I can make your dad do anything. 
 Guilt him, then. 
 Tell him I spent my whole morning making him a healthy lunch when I should have been focusing on my test today. 
 Which we both know you have in the bag. 
 You already aced the written exam. 
 Today is gonna be a piece of cake. 
 Today will be the hardest thing you've ever attempted. 
 In your life. Morning. 
 This is for you. Maya's gonna give you a ride. 
 I am perfectly capable of feeding and driving myself. 
 You know what this test is called, correct? 
 The Incinerator! 
 Because it can burn you alive. Literally. 
 And figuratively. 
 It's designed to test every single aspect it takes to be captain. 
 I know, Dad. I know. 
 Do you know, the day I took the test, somebody died? 
 This is not a chaste little drill. 
 It's a real fire in a real building. 
 They call it a controlled burn, but fire isn't something that any of us can really control. 
 The only way to get through this test is to show it who's boss. 
 Luckily, I boss very well. 
 Hm. Eat. 
 That's probably Jack. 
 Jack? 
 Yes, Jack. 
 We're carpooling to the test. 
 Curious choice. 
 Just because we broke up doesn't mean we can't sit in a car together for 20 stupid minutes. 
 Good luck! Suerte! 
 You're not Jack. 
 I am not. 
 I brought you a good-luck charm. 
 What? 
 I haven't seen this in years! 
 Because the last time we passed it back and forth was the morning I tested for the police academy. 
 Yeah. Worked. I got in. 
 I remember handing this thing off in the halls at school, during finals. 
 And pretty much any time we got in after curfew. 
 I-I think you brought it to me in juvie once. 
 And you, you slipped it into my pocket before I got on the plane to New York. 
 To bring my dad home. 
 See? 
 Works every time. 
 Ryan, I wanted to talk to you. 
 Morning. 
 I was just dropping by to wish Andy luck today. 
 How neighborly of you. 
 Well. 
 Um, we should go. 
 Andy and Jack left Montgomery in charge? 
 Well, he's got seniority. 
 You are looking sharp, Montgomery. 
 Bishop, can you check the bottles... Mm. 
 ...and make sure that they're all topped off? 
 Miller. 
 Are we all stocked up on cleaning supplies? 
 Did you get your uniform professionally pressed? 
 Also, I'd like a complete list of inventory on my desk by 11:00. 
 You did. 
 You starched your collar. 
 You know this is only for one shift, right? 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Hey, so, I was looking at the new vehicle assignments. 
 Yes. A finely honed balance. 
 Each individual assignment carefully, purposefully selected. 
 Right. So, I was thinking that, um, since you're acting captain, don't you want to be on truck? 
 Instead of Aid Car? 
 The captain should be on truck, right? 
 Right. Yes, you're right. Yeah. 
 Yeah. I should be on the truck. 
 Duh. Thanks. Thank you. 
 Of course. Can you do Aid Car? 
 Oh, whatever you want. 
 Right. Thanks. Yeah. 
 I told Maya and my dad that you and I could get along. 
 That we weren't children who have to give each other the silent treatment. 
 So let's not give each other the silent treatment, okay? 
 Especially not today, of all days. 
 I think it's best if we just stay out of each other's way today. 
 Do what we're there to do. 
 Keep our distance. 
 Jack, when one of us is named captain, we have to figure out how to get along. 
 Yup. 
 But not today. 
 Uh... Morning, Gibson. 
 Herrera, you're late. 
 Are... Are all these people testing for captain, too? 
 I thought there'd be five or six, tops. 
 Grab a spot, Herrera. 
 Is that the fire chief? 
 Didn't know he'd be here. 
 Great. Because, otherwise, today was gonna be too easy. 
 You are the candidates with the highest written exam scores. 
 And today you'll put all that theory into practice by each of you leading a group of four through a call inside the warehouse. 
 The goal is to extinguish a fire and rescue a 200-pound dummy as quickly as possible. 
 And these rankings will follow you throughout your application process. 
 If you are unable to retrieve the dummy at all, you forfeit. 
 I'm sure Fire Chief Ripley here needs no introduction to this group, and I know he would like to say a few words. 
 Listen, guys. 
 Today is not about winning, so wash that out of your minds. 
 Today... and every day moving forward if you're chosen as captain... is about being a leader, so focus on that. 
 If you're physically unable to continue, Aid Cars are standing by. 
 Report into them. 
 I am not in the mood to lose a firefighter today, so, please, no heroics. 
 Got it? Do you think there's a day when she's ever in the mood to lose a firefighter? 
 Charlotte Dearborn, Station 12. 
 Hi. Hi. 
 Do you have something to add, Lieutenant Dearborn? 
 Out of curiosity, how many captain spots are open in the department this year? 
 Does that matter? 
 Just like to know my odds before heading in. 
 This year, there's just one. 
 Station 19. 
 The teams are gonna be assigned alphabetically. 
 First squad is... 
 Dearborn, Edmonds, Gibson, Herrera. 
 Hmm. 
 Guess we're stuck together today after all. 
 Guess we are. 
 Station 19. How may I help you? 
 Uh, yeah. Oh. 
 Let me get your contact info. 
 Uh, can you hold just a minute? 
 Sir, are you all right? 
 Do you need to lie down or... What do you need? 
 I need you to mind your own business. 
 Give me the phone. With all due respect, sir, should you even be here? 
 Maybe you need to go home, you know? 
 Get some rest? Miller, the phone. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Preschool down the block... 
 They want to bring the kids by for a tour. 
 They're on line 2. 
 Copy. 
 Pruitt Herrera. Can I help you? 
 Jack Gibson, 19. 
 Charlotte Dearborn, 12. 
 Cole Edmonds, 7. Uh, Andy Herrera, 19. 
 Oh, both of you from 19. That's complicated. 
 Tell me the stories are true... great calls, great crew, best stats in the department? 
 All true. Every word. We get the job done. 
 Let's see who gets to play captain first. 
 Number draw time. 
 One thing's for sure... You do not want to go last, when everybody's fried and the building is trashed. 
 First! Sweet! 
 What'd you get? Um, last. 
 Goody. All right, guys, huddle up! 
 All right. 
 Nod at me or something, like you're agreeing with me right now. 
 Agreeing with you about what? 
 Look, Ripley never comes to these things. 
 Today's a big deal. 
 We just need to seem impressive. 
 You know, like a team. 
 So this is a fake inspirational huddle? 
 All right! 
 Teamwork makes the dream work, right, guys? 
 We're gonna do this! 
 On my count. 
 3, 2, 1! 
 Come on, you guys. Let's do this together! 
 Whoo! 
 Fire ahead! 
 Judging from the amount of smoke, it's not the only one burning. 
 We should probably split off. 
 This ain't my first rodeo. 
 Ladies, grab the secondary hose. 
 Gibson and I will head in first to handle this one. 
 We can follow you in and hit those flames, too. 
 I'd prefer it if you stay back here and cover us like I asked, okay, hon? 
 We got it. 
 Did he just call you "hon"? 
 Is that helping? 
 Just testing the tools. 
 Gotta keep them ready for when we need them. 
 Yeah, I, uh... 
 I think you know that's not what I meant. 
 Here we go. 
 I've been watching you avoid fires basically every shift for weeks. 
 Yeah, and it's working like a charm. 
 Everything's fine. 
 No, everything's not fine. 
 I've been keeping this secret for you, but what are you doing? 
 You're... You're turning blowtorches on and off? 
 You need to get some help, talk to someone. 
 Yeah, I don't owe you a progress report. 
 Look, I've seen this before. 
 I've seen surgeons get themselves so rattled they're afraid to cut. 
 If it goes on too long, it can mess with your head, and if that happens, it is hard to get out. 
 I really don't need you to "doctor" me right now. 
 If you would just... 
 Station 19. Respond. Trapped victim. 
 Vic, don't... 
 Fire's out back there. 
 Where do you need us next? We've swept a dozen rooms. 
 The dummy must be on the other side of this crawl space. 
 It's gonna be a tight squeeze. 
 Send me or Herrera. We're smaller. 
 We can navigate through. 
 That's very sweet of you to offer, but I don't wanna get held up in here today. 
 Gibson, stay on my six, will you? 
 You ladies, you stay here. 
 We'll holler if we get hung up. 
 Excuse me, hon. 
 That's not my name. 
 Thanks. 
 Ah. So, once again, we're sidelined. 
 Doing "lady" jobs. Yeah. 
 I'd like to see him pull that kind of thing in front of Frankel. 
 You think he actually has a shot? 
 I think everybody here has a shot. 
 You know 19's a bit of a legend, right? 
 I mean, I know it's a great station. 
 To me, anyway. 
 You kidding? To everybody. 
 Must be weird to think of someone else coming in to run it. 
 Yeah, I hadn't realized it was the only spot open. 
 Come on, ladies! Coming your way! 
 Okay, sugar pie cupcake boo! 
 See you soon! 
 I won't, but it is so tempting to just stick my boot out and trip him. 
 Hey, nice job. Made good time. 
 Impressive. 
 Hey, good job. 
 That was really fast. 
 Definitely better than last time. 
 I'm pretty sure it was. 
 Probably was. 
 Yeah? Do you want to sign on? 
 What... What is there to talk about? 
 The stopwatch is the judge. Dunno. 
 Sometimes we ladies really have to talk things over, you know, with a big, tall man. 
 Super helpful. 
 Have fun in there with your new buddy? 
 The guy's a tool. 
 Ego on steroids. 
 Yeah, I mean, we can't have somebody like him taking over our station. 
 We've really gotta be on our game. 
 He made good time, a time we're both gonna have to beat. 
 Sure, okay. 
 Where's our Vic? 
 I don't get it. This is the address. 
 Double-check with dispatch. 
 Find out where they need us to go. 
 Help! Help! 
 Oh, no. Oh, my God. 
 Hughes, where you going? Get up! Get up! 
 Get up! I can't! 
 Get out of the street! I can't move! 
 Hey, get the truck to block off the traffic right now! 
 Hughes! 
 Stop! No, no, no, no, no! No! 
 Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop! 
 Stop! Stop! Watch out! 
 Oh, no! You okay? 
 Hey. Hi. 
 I'm Victoria. Everyone calls me Vic. 
 What's your name? Piper. 
 Okay, Piper. I think I can let go now. 
 Hughes, you still in one piece? 
 Yeah. That was ridiculous. 
 Are you sure you're okay? 
 Yeah. Okay, follow my finger. 
 You wanna tell us how you wound up here in this, uh... 
 What is that, a pothole? 
 I was just crossing the street. 
 I didn't see the hole, and... and when I stepped in it, the whole thing just gave way. 
 Okay, we need to start rigging up harnesses and attach them to the truck. I want everybody ready and secure. 
 For a pothole? 
 That could turn into a sinkhole. 
 Miller, let's maintain a wide perimeter around this thing. 
 Will do. 
 Let's get you out of here, okay? 
 On the count of three. One, two, three! 
 Oh, oh, oh! 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! 
 Okay, the asphalt's piercing her flesh. 
 You can't pick her up without ripping her leg to pieces. 
 So we dig her out? 
 Yeah, looks that way. 
 All right, let's do this! 
 Right. 
 We've got multiple blazes, one down that front hall, another cutting off the offices. 
 Herrera, you slide down past the first door and start your sweep from there. 
 You want me to go past the fire? 
 We never do that. 
 It's just basics. 
 Herrera's right. We might want to... 
 Hey, it's my call. 
 As captain, I'm asking you to divide and conquer. 
 Go on. 
 Go divide! Go conquer! 
 Come on! 
 I've got a victim to find, and I'm on a tight schedule. 
 I think I remember a cut-through back there. 
 Maybe we can get around this, come at it closer to the source. 
 Where are you going? I just said. 
 Yeah, I don't have time for that. 
 That's not the safest way. You're kidding me. 
 Better hurry if you want to keep up! 
 Aha! 
 See? This is why you're not supposed to pass the fire before it's out. 
 Guys, I could use a little backup in here. 
 I got the dummy, but I can't get him out. 
 Over. 
 Copy! On our way. 
 Sit tight. 
 Herrera, confirm you're clear before we open up. 
 Clear! 
 Oh, yeah! 
 You all right? 
 Herrera, nicely done! Up top! 
 Congratulations, Dearborn. You just set an all-time record. 
 Well done. 
 And that's how it's done, hon. 
 So, I guess she's the one to beat. 
 Seems that way. 
 Just keep an eye out. 
 If she develops compartment syndrome, she could lose her leg. Did he just say... 
 Did you just say lose my leg? 
 Is that true? Is that gonna happen? 
 Okay, we are doing everything in our power to make sure that doesn't happen. 
 Oh, okay. Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Oh, God! Okay! Hey, hey. Hey, hey. 
 You live around here? 
 I used to. Yeah? 
 Still come by every morning for coffee and a walk, though. 
 A good friend of mine lives close. 
 Do you want us to call her? No! 
 No. I'd just as soon she not see me like this. 
 I'd really rather just go home and pretend like this never happened. 
 Hey, you'll still need to go to the hospital after this. 
 Might be nice to have your friend with you. 
 I've gotta get used to things without her anyway. 
 She's moving away. 
 And I... 
 I kinda can't bear it. 
 I was on my way to talk to her about that, but the universe clearly had other ideas. 
 I got all the way home, I thought about it, I came back, and then I didn't get two steps across this stupid street before my leg got trapped inside a damn pothole. 
 And now I just... I need to go home, okay? 
 Can you please just get me out so I can go? 
 Yeah. We're... We're working on it. 
 Your calls in there were questionable. 
 They were dangerous. 
 You say "dangerous," I say "assertive." 
 We can't be shy little violets to conquer this test. 
 These guys play rough, we gotta play rougher. 
 You feel me? No. 
 Plus, it worked! 
 I pushed you hard, you did badass things. 
 Doesn't it feel good? No. 
 Not when you're putting lives in danger. 
 Not when you're taking unnecessary risks. 
 See, now, I know you were recently promoted. 
 Here's a pro tip: 
 You don't get the best from your team by coddling them. 
 You've gotta push. 
 And while I would never want to squash another woman just to win this, make no mistake... 
 I will, if I have to. 
 I'll do whatever it takes. 
 So I suggest you stop worrying about me and start worrying about you. 
 You've got an uphill climb ahead. 
 Sure, okay. 
 You may have been lieutenant longer, but that doesn't mean you've got more experience. 
 In fact, I keep hearing people say my recent promotion means I'm not prepared to be captain. 
 I've helped my father run Station 19 for longer than most people around here have been doing this job at all, so unless you became a firefighter when you were in diapers, I'm pretty confident I can take you. 
 I don't mind being underestimated. 
 That's fine by me. 
 'Cause all it means is, it'll be easier for me to sneak in, rise up, and take the hell over. 
 You are adorable. 
 See ya in there. 
 You ever know something about somebody, and you don't exactly know what to do with it? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 So out of respect for this person, you don't do anything with it, obviously, but it's hard, because, like, in your heart, you know that there are other people who should know about this thing. 
 Right. Right, so, what do you do? 
 Do you just, like, keep your mouth shut and hope for the best? 
 Hey, a little less slack on these lines, guys. 
 And don't let them get tangled. 
 You're really having us babysit this rope instead of being up there tearing up concrete? 
 If this street gives way, I need you guys right here making sure those people don't go down with it. 
 All right? I'm not losing anybody on my first call in charge. 
 Again, I... 
 I have to ask. 
 To a pothole? 
 Okay, that's fine. Make fun. 
 You know? Laugh it up. 
 It's not gonna be as funny when this entire block collapses in on itself, and you are sucked into a giant hole full of concrete and rebar. 
 That just got dark. Did not see him going there. 
 I mean... I mean, I think this captain thing is messing with his head. I mean, if you wanna talk, it's like, we're here. Do it. 
 Do you think the asphalt's pinning her femoral artery? 
 If it is, we need to loosen the opening elsewhere and keep that part pinned as long as possible. 
 Piper, if your leg starts to feel too heavy or too tight, you let us know, okay? Okay. 
 Ya know, maybe you should revisit talking to your friend. 
 She's not... 
 I mean, she is my friend, but she's... she's also... 
 I think she's also more than that, to me. 
 I think. 
 I may have felt it for some time now, but I've never... 
 I mean, I didn't even realize it until this morning, and... 
 She's had girlfriends, and I've had girlfriends, but we've never... 
 I tell her everything. 
 I-I think I'm in love with her. 
 And I have no idea how to tell her that. 
 Maybe... just tell her. 
 Well, that's easy for you to say. 
 You guys are fricking fearless. 
 We're scared of plenty. 
 I'm scared of plenty. 
 You dove in front of a giant truck. 
 I can't even talk to my friend. 
 Of course you're scared. 
 You care about what she thinks, and you don't want her to think differently about you. 
 I can't. 
 I don't know how to talk about this stuff. 
 I just... I... Piper? 
 My God, Piper! What happened?! 
 Are you okay? 
 Hey. 
 All right, fire's clear! 
 Let's start the sweep for the dummy! 
 Let's go! 
 Nothing? Tick tock. 
 All right, let's sweep again. 
 This time, everyone checks the opposite sides of the building. 
 No stone unturned. 
 Come on. Really? 
 We just checked everywhere. 
 Clearly not everywhere, or we'd have found the dummy. 
 Hey, we do what our captain says. 
 Let's go! 
 What now, Captain? 
 At least we know we can eliminate Gibson as competition. 
 Hey. Sidebar. 
 We've done everything in the book, double-checked every inch of this place. 
 The only thing left to do is... leave. 
 I mean, if you're wrong, this could take you out of the running for captain completely. 
 So could staying here. Searching for nothing. 
 Your test, your call. 
 I'll... I'll support whatever you decide. 
 No dummy? 
 No, sir. 
 Not this time. 
 You are the first candidate in five years to crack that variation of the test... and in fantastic time, nonetheless. 
 You're right. 
 There was no dummy. 
 Very impressive. 
 What's your name again? 
 Gibson, sir. 
 Station 19. 
 All right. Good to know. 
 I can't believe this. The swelling's getting worse. 
 
 
 
 I know. Her BP's creeping down. 
 I mean, these streets are unsafe! 
 And we will not stand for it. 
 I don't want you to move away. 
 Oh. 
 Not because I'm not happy for you, but because I don't want to not see you again. 
 I... 
 I have feelings for you. 
 More-than-just-friend feelings, and... 
 I wanted to say it this morning, and I couldn't. 
 And then this afternoon, but then this happened, and I just... I... 
 I wasn't even sure how you would take it. 
 Piper, how I'd take it? 
 Well, yeah, because... 
 This isn't exactly how I imagined our first kiss, but... I'm not complaining. 
 Look, if we have something to say to each other from now on, let's just say it. 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Her BP's too low. Most likely caused by a bleed in her leg below the surface. 
 We gotta get her outta there. Even if we have to force it. 
 Let's get a tourniquet just in case. 
 And be ready to get her to the hospital immediately. 
 Every minute makes a difference. 
 Work together, work fast, guys. Um, guys... remember when you told me to let you know if my leg started to feel tight at all? 
 Yeah, we know. 
 We're gonna get you to the hospital ASAP. 
 I'm going with you. 
 Okay, but if you can't, it's... 
 Piper, I mean it. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 I wish we had more time to loosen the gravel. 
 But we don't. Okay. I'll count us in. 
 3, 2, 1. You're gonna be okay. 
 Go. 
 Come on, keep pulling! 
 We got it. We got it. A little more. A little more. 
 We got it. 
 Come on! Up, up, up! 
 Let's get her to the Aid Car, right? 
 Fast. Let's go. 
 Pretty much zero visibility in here. 
 Yeah, even the turnout lights aren't doing much. 
 We're dealing with residual smoke from the whole day. 
 Herrera, you got a plan? 
 All right. 
 The whole point of this test is to prove we can captain a team, and none of us have worked that way today. 
 I want us to trust each other and work together. 
 Especially if we're going in blind. 
 Line up and hold on to each other. 
 We do this together. 
 All right. 
 Everybody call out from their position! 
 It's the only way to stay connected in the dark. 
 Talk to me every step! 
 You got it! Copy that. 
 Yes, ma'am! 
 All right, moving forward another step! 
 Good! 
 Sweeping the floor. Nothing. 
 Hang on! 
 Encountered something. 
 Nope, no dummy. 
 Okay, good. 
 Moving forward again! 
 Anything? 
 Clear! All clear! 
 What the hell was that? 
 Pretty sure I don't wanna know. 
 Keep going! Moving forward! 
 That sounds bad. Sounds real bad. 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Jack! You all right?! Check in! 
 Oh! Gibson. Check. Dearborn. Check. 
 Cole?! 
 Cole, check in! 
 Who's got hands on Edmonds? 
 We broke apart when the ceiling collapsed. 
 Well, dig through and find him! 
 Cole?! Edmonds?! 
 No, no, no, no. Edmonds! 
 Damn it! 
 Hey, hold on! Hold on! 
 I found him. 
 Is he okay? 
 Can't tell. 
 He's knocked out cold. 
 I'm calling it in. 
 Charlotte, don't. Don't. 
 Mayday, mayday. Officer down. 
 Are you calling for Rapid Intervention? 
 Negative, we've got him. 
 We just need to get the hell outta here. 
 Aid Car on standby at the door. 
 Everybody out right now. 
 His pulse is steady. He's coming to. 
 Andy, come on. 
 Mayday was called. Mission's over. 
 You heard Frankel. Get him out to that Aid Car. 
 Stay on the walls. Andy, hey. 
 A huge chunk of ceiling just fell in. 
 This building's had it. There's still time before it's completely compromised. 
 What are you saying? You guys go. 
 Get Cole the help he needs. 
 Andy, no. 
 I'll be right behind you. As soon as I get the victim. 
 Hey, it's just a dummy! It's not just a dummy! 
 It's my shot to captain 19. 
 Now, I'm not about to surrender my home to a stranger. 
 If this were a real call, I'd never leave that person behind. 
 Time to show this Incinerator I'm the boss. 
 Get him the hell out of here. 
 Copy that. 
 You don't have to stay for this. 
 Buddy system. 
 I'm not leaving you alone. 
 Uh! Come on! 
 Very nice job. 
 All right, Andy! Let's go, Herrera! 
 Great stuff! Good job! 
 I made it out. I got the dummy. 
 When a mayday is called, you get out immediately. 
 You don't take your time. You don't go back in. 
 I got the victim out. 
 It was the right thing to do. 
 No, the right thing to do is to pay attention to the call. 
 What you did broke protocol. 
 What you did was inherently selfish. 
 By... By going in after a victim? 
 By trying to get extra points on a test. 
 By playing a game, instead of acting like a true captain. 
 A true captain wouldn't have flinched if she had the chance to save a human life. 
 A true captain... Herrera, is it? 
 I'm gonna stop you before you say something more you might regret. 
 And, Frankel, I'm stopping you because I don't like the idea of reprimanding one of my officers in front of their candidates. 
 Reprimand me? 
 Your job is to evaluate everyone, unbiased. 
 We'll talk later. 
 I understand why you made the call you did out there. 
 It's morally admirable, and it's the kind of thing that inspires, and that's good. 
 But our rules are in place for a reason. 
 And it's a captain's job to remember that, even when it isn't convenient. 
 Now, you got out of there this time. 
 It's a controlled environment. 
 But in most cases, we'd be pulling you, your teammate, and your victim out in body bags. 
 Captains have to balance what's moral and what's practical. 
 Sometimes that means making the toughest calls. 
 Now, I understand why you made the decision to ignore the mayday, but I do not agree with it. 
 See you at your panel interview. 
 You suggest earlier that I should go home, put my feet up. 
 You know, I'm thinking I'll do just that. 
 Go home, kick back. 
 The game's on. 
 Maybe I'll catch the end or something. 
 You seem like you're feeling better, sir. 
 Would you mind keeping an ear out for the phone? 
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure thing. 
 And, uh, Miller? 
 I'd prefer if you didn't say anything to anybody else about... earlier. 
 If you feel better, then I feel better, sir. 
 Great. 
 Nicely captained today, Montgomery. 
 Turned out to be a tidy little call. 
 You know, there is something to being stuck somewhere that makes you honest with people. 
 I'm honest with Montgomery. 
 Whenever we're stuck in the Aid Car. 
 Stop wearing so much damn cologne. 
 Okay, now that we're back here safely, I-I have to ask. 
 What is the likelihood of a pothole like that opening up and becoming an actual sinkhole? 
 What makes you think you're safe here? 
 Okay, but, you know, at the call, you... you said that you were certain it wouldn't happen. 
 Defense mechanism. 
 Total bravado. It's true. 
 You never know when a disaster like that is lying in wait. 
 Ready to suddenly, shockingly open up and swallow us whole. 
 I think I'm scared of fire. 
 What is she talking about? I don't know. 
 I think she's being hyperbolic. 
 No, she's not. 
 Go on. 
 I don't... I don't have a lot of people I'd call family. 
 Especially not around here. 
 I mean, y'all are it, basically. 
 Vic, what's the matter? 
 I have a problem. 
 I've been trying to work through it on my own. 
 Willing it to go away because I know... 
 I know it's this disaster lying in wait. 
 And I don't know how you guys will react. 
 And I-I don't know if this means I'm gonna have to say goodbye to my family, when I don't want that. 
 I don't want to say goodbye to you guys. 
 But I don't think I can... 
 I don't think I can hold this in anymore, and I don't think I should. 
 I need to be honest. 
 What do you mean when you say you're afraid of fire? 
 Ever Si... Ever since the tanker with the blue fire, I just... 
 ...I've started to... to flinch. 
 Every time I get near a flame, I stop. 
 I... 
 That flash on the roof nearly gave me a heart attack. 
 I stop. 
 I freeze up. I can't... 
 It takes every ounce of self-control not to run in the opposite direction. 
 Kind of the opposite of what you want to do. 
 When you're a firefighter. 
 I know. 
 This has been going on for weeks? 
 Yes. 
 Numerous calls, numerous shifts. 
 Not a word. Nothing. 
 Look, I s... Like I said, I've been... 
 I've been trying to work on it on my own. 
 We're not gonna let somebody else come in and take over. 
 I'm still in this. 
 I'll win 19 for the both of us if I have to. 
 I can't talk about this right now. 
 Thank you, Vic, for being honest with us. 
 I think we all know what we need to do next. 
 Okay, I'll tell Herrera and Gibson when they get back. 
 No. 
 We don't say a word to them. 
 They'll have to report you. 
 We keep you in the Aid Car for the time being. 
 And when we can't do that, we can all make sure that you're on pump or hydrant until you're ready to go back in. 
 I know a guy at the training tower. 
 We can run simulations on our days off. 
 Yeah, I know some drills we can try out here, too. 
 Hypnosis worked for a guy at my old station. 
 I'll... I'll help with anything. 
 You want cover, you just tell 'em I'm hopeless and you're training me. 
 Well, that's not... That's not much of a stretch, so... 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks, you guys, for doing this. 
 Yeah, like you said, we're family. 
 You'd do it for us. Right. 
 Now, the question is... 
 Come here. 
 What will you do for the rest of us? 
 Oh. Okay. 
 Don't start with the laundry again. What? 
 That ship has sailed. But my shirts, they shrink. 
 You know you do that on purpose to tighten your sleeves. 
 Mm. Yeah. We know you do that. 
 O-Okay, don't hate. 
 Appreciate. You said you hated my cologne! 
 I can't believe you said that! 
 It's terrible. It is a little overwhelming. 
 The thing we sometimes forget is, there's real strength in numbers. 
 Hey. 
 I was just stopping by to see how things went. 
 Your dad must be asleep. He didn't answer. 
 You're just getting back? 
 Long day. 
 How'd it go? 
 Uh, thanks for this. 
 Did it work? Yeah, I don't think so. 
 Things didn't go well today. 
 Ah, I don't believe for a minute that you didn't kick ass. 
 I didn't say I didn't kick ass. 
 But, still, it... it didn't go well today. 
 Want me to stay to talk about it or... 
 We don't have to go it alone if we don't want to. 
 Thank you, but... 
 I think my dad's the person I need to talk to right now. 
 Okay. 
 If you change your mind, you know where to find me. 
 There's value in reaching out. 
 Dad, you were right. 
 The Incinerator was brutal. 
 Do you know who was there? Chief Ripley. 
 There's hope in asking for help. 
 Dad, are you up? 
 Dad? 
 So reach out. Open up. Be honest. 
 Trust your team to get you out of that burning building, even if you can't see the way out yourself. 
 Because one thing's for sure. 
 Hello. 
 I, uh... need you to page Dr. Miranda Bailey, please. 
 I'm her patient. 
 You can't do it alone.
