 Previously on "Station 19"... 
 Your dad's back? 
 You think I'm here to use you? 
 I got in a little trouble, and I know I'm living on borrowed time. 
 He's very different outside of work. 
 Have a great rest of your night, Chief. 
 Bishop, pleased to see your lieutenant application come through. 
 Looking forward to our interview. 
 I guess this is it. 
 It's just a little break. 
 When you live on this boat, just listen to this Captain. 
 I would like to have the respect of my crew. 
 You and I should sit. 
 Over coffee or...? That could work. 
 When you're living with someone, you don't rearrange the furniture. 
 Jack's up at all weird hours, and he's doing a lot of weird things. 
 It could be dangerous. 
 Board up your windows. 
 Take shelter. 
 Find your flashlights. 
 Hunker down. 
 That's the advice you hear when a storm is coming. 
 Come in. This is Aid 19. 
 Are we clear for transport? 
 Negative, Aid 19. 
 All roads to Grey-Sloan Memorial are blocked. 
 Is there another hospital? 
 Anywhere we can get to? Copy? 
 Still no service. 
 Dispatch, this is Aid 19. 
 Do you copy?! 
 Is this thing moving? 
 So when the horizon turns dark... 
 Thank you. 
 And when the clouds are forming... 
 Here we go. 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks for letting me pick your brain. 
 You want to, uh, find a bench somewhere, or... 
 Oh, no, here's fine. 
 O-Okay. 
 Then, um, pick away, I guess. 
 I would like to feel... more... in sync with the team. 
 You know, right now, I'm not... exactly. 
 Well, I think if you want it to feel more in sync, you should just open up more. 
 Well, I like to keep my personal life personal. 
 Yeah, and we would like to feel as though we're more than just assets. 
 You are. More. Of course. 
 Well, see? Say that. With actions. 
 Come out of your office every now and then. 
 Join us for meals. 
 Your dad said the same thing. 
 We're a lot alike, my dad and I, and I don't know how I feel about that sometimes. 
 T-There. 
 I-I shared something personal about myself. 
 See how easy that is? 
 But we don't need you to pour your heart out or anything. 
 Just give us something, ya know? 
 Why'd you come back to Seattle? 
 Why'd you leave in the first place? 
 Who are your family, your... your people? 
 My... My people? 
 Yeah. 
 Sure. 
 Thanks for your time, Herrera. 
 I, uh... I should be going, actually. 
 I'll see you next shift. 
 When the wind picks up and knocks you back on your feet... don't take risks. 
 Settle in somewhere safe... and wait. 
 That's what we're taught to do... if we want to weather the storm. 
 Okay... Ben? 
 Sorry I woke you, but I, uh, I didn't know the rules about using my key during our separation. 
 We are not separated. 
 We are taking time apart so that I can focus on bringing my stress down. 
 It's a sabbatical. 
 Yeah, I know what you call it. 
 And even though I'm not sleeping in this house, I still want the people who live here to stay safe. 
 Wind storm's on the way. 
 It's supposed to get pretty ugly. 
 I, uh... I was gonna board up the windows before my shift... if that's okay with you. 
 Yes, of course. 
 Just try not to wake up Tuck. 
 I will hammer the nails into the boards as quietly as possible. 
 I'll do Tuck's windows last. 
 This thing doesn't fit into the other thing. 
 What are you, sleepwalking? 
 All right, let me see. 
 Just groggy. I need coffee to... make the coffee. 
 Storm's coming in. Exactly. 
 In the form of too many people coming over to my place. 
 Where is Warren, anyway? 
 I only agreed to do this for him because he's been a sad-face emoji ever since Dr. Bailey kicked him out. 
 Those are for eating. 
 I am eating them. 
 Later. 
 Whoa! Hey! 
 Hope you don't mind, I brought Grant. 
 The restaurant decided to stay closed 
 'cause of the storm, so... 
 You're a chef. 
 You know chef things? 
 I do. 
 This way. 
 Happy Friendsgiving! Hey. 
 I almost blew over walking down the dock. 
 Are we sure this is the best place to wait out a windstorm... 
 In a house on water with lots of windows? 
 There are storm shutters. 
 This is Warren's deal. 
 I just wanna make my drinks in peace. 
 It's not even Thanksgiving. 
 Because it's Friendsgiving, which is better. 
 It's all the fun without all the pressure. 
 Hope you don't mind, I brought Greg with me. 
 Welcome. Thank you. 
 To my home. 
 With Dean and, uh, Warren. 
 Greg's staying with me for a few days while he recovers. 
 I come bearing gifts. 
 Ry tells me you make some sort of legendary margarita? 
 Uh... yes! 
 Y-Yes. T-Tanner. 
 Your dad is welcome any time. 
 Sorry, I got to take this. 
 Hey, what about me? Aren't I, uh... welcome anytime? 
 Yes, sir. 
 You're on the water. 
 Sometimes you have the guys over to enjoy the views. 
 I'm a guy. I enjoy views. 
 I don't like it out there. 
 Please, do you... do you have somebody coming, too? 
 No. Why would I bring someone? 
 Don't be weird. Hey. 
 When is the first batch of those gonna be ready? 
 It is a very delicate and precise process. 
 You can't... You can't rush the 'rita. 
 Hey. Pretty sure the party's not in here. 
 That's a federal arrest warrant issued to the entire Seattle PD. 
 FBI tracked him from Florida. 
 FBI's involved? 
 Theft, gambling, wire fraud. 
 Only this time, he did it across state lines. 
 Does he know yet? 
 No. 
 Today was going to be our first sort of 
 "holiday" together in... in a long time. 
 Now I have to arrest him? I mean, how do I do that? 
 What am I supposed to do, you know? 
 Sorry, Tanner... 
 I couldn't hear a single thing you just said. 
 Storm's pretty loud. 
 Coverage is spotty. 
 You're not on duty, so I know you don't wanna talk shop. 
 You've told me nothing, you've seen nothing, and you can't act on a warrant that you know nothing about. 
 Mr. Herrera, he has to be... 
 He's not going anywhere right now. 
 Join the party. 
 Come have a "sort of" holiday. 
 Oh. Hey. 
 Your dad's here? 
 Seemed weird to leave him home alone. 
 He was telling the truth about how he got injured, you know. 
 Okay. 
 Sure. 
 About the other stuff that you heard me say to him... 
 I don't want to get into that right now. 
 I need to chop. 
 What can I chop? 
 What did that celery do to you? Nothing. Everything. 
 Ryan is just so frustrating, and Sullivan... ugh... you should've seen him this morning. 
 This morning? Yeah, at coffee. 
 I thought it might be a productive morning, and I thought I... Wait, hold up. 
 You had coffee with Sullivan? So? 
 I mean, people have lives outside the station. 
 She wasn't breaking any laws. 
 Clearly, it was a bad idea, and I'm just happy to be here with you and not around Sullivan at all. 
 It's Sullivan. 
 Weather's gotten worse, and B-shift is stranded. 
 Seems we have to come in, after all. 
 Mnh! 
 All right, we got a few rules to go over. 
 Captain, we know windstorm protocols. 
 A quick review never hurts. 
 High winds mean fires can ignite and spread exponentially faster than under normal circumstances. 
 We're already getting multiple reports of downed trees and power lines. 
 Your priority is to keep yourselves safe. 
 Pack up extra gear, extra tanks, extra everything. 
 It's gonna be a long one. 
 The storm's just getting started. 
 Are you with us all day, sir? 
 For the time being, yes. 
 I'm checking in on all high-call areas today. 
 I can't believe Ripley's here. Yeah, me, neither. 
 I'm due to interview with him this week for the lieutenant position. So today's a perfect opportunity to show him what you got, firsthand. 
 Aid Car... 
 Medical response requested at 844 Hawthorne Street. 
 Bishop, Gibson, that's you. 
 Actually, I'll take this one. 
 I'm the captain. 
 I should be first out. 
 You should stay here, near Ripley. 
 Impress the hell out of him. 
 I got you. 
 Hey, uh, Chief, can I tag in for Bishop? 
 Fine with me. Sullivan, you good riding with Herrera instead? 
 No problem. 
 The airbag went off! 
 Looks like it was hit by another car! 
 No sign of another vehicle! 
 Hit and run? Yeah, probably. 
 So where's our victim? 
 That's her car. 
 Get off my wife... my wife! 
 Oh, no... 
 Oh, my God! 
 10 floods, 5 area lights... Fully stocked on flashlights. 
 You know, I am both really glad to be here and pissed that the storm is happening today. 
 We're good on pants and parkas? 
 All high-visibility rain gear accounted for. 
 We can do Friendsgiving another time. 
 I know, I just could have really used it, ya know? 
 Oh, we'll come over and celebrate at the next shift off, or the one after that, or the one after that, or the one after that, or the one... Wait, what now? 
 Hey. Hey. 
 What are you guys doing here? 
 Oh, hang on, did... did you decide to save Friendsgiving? 
 Did you decide to save Friendsgiving? 
 Actually, he did. 
 So, we're doing it here? Yep. 
 Not at the houseboat? Nope. 
 Here? Yep. 
 Yes! Ooh-hoo-hoo! 
 Well, that's an excellent idea, and Tanner, for real, your... Your dad's all right. 
 Aww, it's not a big thing. 
 You guys work so hard, it'd be a crime not to enjoy a good meal. 
 And, hey... 
 I would know. 
 Here, help... Let me help you carry that stuff up. 
 The turkey isn't drying out, is it? 
 And the stuffing? 
 Oh, oh, and we gotta make sure that we sauté the onions and celery in butter first, 'cause if you don't, well, they just... Ben, relax. 
 I know what I'm doing. And he really does. 
 He already has three investors on the hook for his new Korean pop-up. 
 Oh, really? That's no small thing. 
 How long've you guys married? 
 Excuse me? 
 No, no, no, no, no. We're not married. 
 No. I'm sorry, I just... 
 I saw the ring, and I-I assumed. 
 Oh! Yeah, yeah... This is, um... 
 It's... It's... It's some... Something else. 
 A promise ring? 
 Let's go with that. 
 Old school. Ha, I like it. 
 I tried to get out of the road to get to the side, and then I felt my leg, like, snap. 
 Can you tell us your name? 
 I'm... I'm Shannon. 
 Shannon, do you know what day it is? 
 Yes. The worst birthday ever. 
 Ow! It's your birthday, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Can you tell us what hurts? 
 My face and then my leg. 
 It hurts, like, a lot. 
 I'm seeing some discoloration. 
 I was having brunch with my boyfriend. 
 For your birthday? I mean, that's what I thought. 
 And then I realized he was about to break up with me, so I just got into my car and drove away. 
 To this. It's starting to swell. 
 Lack of blood flow around the shin and calf. 
 And then that car just, like, came at me out of nowhere and just, like, took off. 
 The lanes are too narrow, no warning... Have been for years. 
 It's irresponsible. 
 This street's a death trap. 
 Let's take care of your leg, okay? 
 I hope you know, I'm at 19 today because of the location. 
 It's so central, and with the storm, I just... I... 
 I don't want you to think I chose 19 as some excuse to see you. 
 Gosh, that would be terrible. 
 Not that I don't want to see you. 
 It's just... 
 You know, we're at work. 
 No, I get it. We're at work. 
 Let's just be... professional, working... while we're at work. 
 Hughes, we stocked on haligans, or do we need more? 
 Chief. Gibson. 
 Well, I'll let you get back to it. 
 Thanks. 
 A-Are we cool? 
 Yeah, as long as those haligans are stocked... 
 No, I mean, are we cool about... that, just now. 
 Yeah. I mean, I'm, uh... I'm good with you... 
 I feel like we need to give him a code name, or something. 
 Rips? Ripples. Okay, so you're keeping it to yourself? 
 Rip Tide? 'Cause you seemed a little weird just now, and... 
 Yeah, but I'm not! You're making it weird. 
 Y... You know what? Sorry. 
 Never mind. 
 Shannon, we think you have a closed fracture. 
 We need to get your leg in a splint and get you over into the Aid Car, okay? 
 Yeah, we need to get her splinted first, otherwise we'll be fighting the wind. 
 So, before my bad day gets better, it's gonna get worse. 
 Yeah, I'm afraid so, but we'll try to be quick. 
 One, two, go. 
 We need to get this wrapped up, okay? 
 Mnh. I'm so sorry, Shannon. 
 Just one more thing. 
 There goes the Kerlix. 
 We're too exposed out here! 
 We'll be safer in the Aid Car. Come on. 
 Ready? One, two, three. 
 Grab her! Grab her! 
 It keeps getting worse! 
 Oh, God! 
 Warren, you live with Gibson. 
 Is everything okay with him? 
 Define your version of "okay." 
 I mean, the guy drinks pickle juice, like, from a jar. 
 And he listens to some weird-ass music. 
 I don't know... he seems on edge or something. 
 I mean, the guy barely sleeps. 
 Why? Did something happen? 
 Engine 19, Ladder 19... 
 Carport collapse at 2124 Silkwood Lane. Warren... you're on the ladder with Miller. 
 Victim trapped in vehicle. Puts me on the engine with you? 
 Uh, actually, no. I'm gonna stay here and hold down the fort. 
 Ripley said I have to, so... 
 Then who am I riding with? 
 Chief, I just want to say how much I admire your leadership style. 
 You're out here in the trenches with us. 
 It's admirable. Thank you, Bishop. 
 Yeah, I agree, and thank you for riding with us, Chief. 
 Especially us. Super unexpected. 
 If I'm asking my team to get their hands dirty, I should, too. 
 You know, it's a style I hope to emulate as a lieutenant, and I try to already, in fact. 
 Right, Hughes? Dirty. Yeah. Uh-huh. 
 Wait, what? What? 
 Hey, hey! Watch out! Tree down up ahead. 
 No, no, I hear you, but my entire crew's already out on calls. 
 Okay, then re-route calls to other stations. 
 Sure. 
 Yeah, keep me posted. 
 Everything okay? 
 I hate that I'm stuck here and I can't do anything more to help. 
 You know, Ripley left you in charge while he's gone. 
 And I know it's not the same as being out in the field, but... 
 I don't like feeling trapped. 
 Fresh cranberries, Meyer lemon. 
 There's no jiggle, though. It's unnatural. 
 The canned stuff is unnatural. 
 No offense or anything... 
 I'm just a little nostalgic for the jiggle. 
 Put some coffee on. 
 Gibson, why don't you sit a minute? 
 No, I need to watch the news and wait for updates from Dispatch. 
 Well, the crew's working. Vehicles are out. 
 There's nothing to do right now but wait. 
 This storm's nothing. 
 Pruitt, you remember the storm in '93? 
 Yeah, I remember I had to board up your windows. 
 Yeah, I remember you got called into work, and I had to clear all the damn branches off the sidewalk. 
 We remember things differently. 
 You know how we used to settle stuff... 
 Might be a good thing to take our minds off the weather, right, Tanner? 
 Maybe. I guess. 
 All right. 
 Deal us in. 
 But not with that deck. 
 We're gonna finish this up, then get you on the road, okay? 
 Okay. Wait, wait, wait. 
 Before we go, is... Is there any way... 
 I h... I h... I have this necklace, and it's... 
 It's in my bag in the car, and it... it was my grandma's. 
 If I... If I lost that on top of everything else, I don't know what I would do. I... I n... Whoa! 
 I need that necklace! All right, all right, all right, all right. 
 I'll go get it. 
 Okay, please. 
 Okay? Okay. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Oh, my God. 
 It's okay, baby. 
 She is my wife, Luke. 
 Captain, I need help in here! 
 This weather's crazy! I can barely see a thing. 
 Don't rush. 
 Getting there fast isn't as important as just getting there. 
 Hey, let me ask you something about before with Grant. 
 And just how adamantly he insisted that the two of you are not married? 
 He crammed about 12 additional "no's" in there for emphasis. 
 Oh, no, no-no, no. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Yeah, but do you even wanna be married? 
 I do not. 
 It's way too early for that, so it's fine. 
 I mean, I'm still wearing Michael's ring, and Grant's never said a word. 
 So I don't care if he adamantly doesn't want a ring himself, obviously. 
 You can't be married and not married all at the same time. 
 Well, actually, uh... 
 There's no getting around this thing! 
 We're stuck! No time to waste. 
 I'll break up the trunk. 
 Bishop, head up a team to get to the victim on foot. 
 On it, sir. Montgomery, Miller, Warren, gear up, start running. 
 I got the jump bag. Man, I wanted to chainsaw! 
 Yeah, everyone wants to chainsaw, Miller! 
 Maybe next time! 
 So, let's do this. 
 Keeping it professional. 
 Absolutely. 
 Professional. 
 No truck? 
 You guys saving on gas? 
 It's a long story. 
 You okay in there? 
 Also a long story. 
 Came out, got in my car, stayed in my car for a while, then the wind knocked that pole down. 
 Actually, I guess it's kind of a short story. 
 Oh, please, get him out as quickly as you can. 
 He isn't hurt, is he? 
 I told you, Mary, I'm fine. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Good, sweetie, I'm so glad. 
 You'll get him out quickly, then, please? 
 So I can make sure he's okay before I injure him myself. 
 You came out here to run to the store two hours ago. 
 I-I can't believe you never even left. 
 Yeah, I see a few minor abrasions, but he's lucky, assuming we can keep this thing from collapsing further. 
 It's gonna take some finesse to get him outta there. 
 We should start with the pole. 
 You know he was trapped out here for two hours, and he didn't even call for help? 
 What's the rush? 
 I'm sure these guys have more important things to deal with today. 
 Plus, it's just so quiet out here and peaceful. 
 If this wind is your idea of peaceful... 
 Heh, spend a few more minutes with my family, you'll understand. You promised me you'd get what I need to make my pies. 
 It takes time to make four different pies from scratch. 
 Honestly, Ruth, you probably just need to make one. 
 I mean, there's three of us, two infants... 
 We don't each need our own pies. 
 Jimmy, please explain to your wife how this is a tradition. 
 Literally right here, Ruth. 
 Okay! 
 If you two wouldn't mind moving away from the precariously leaning structure right now... 
 All the way. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't thank us till you're out. 
 I can't do this. He wants to play poker. 
 I-I busted him at a poker game just a few weeks ago. 
 Tell me how I can help. 
 I don't know. 
 I... 
 I really don't. 
 Hey, guys, come on! Time's wasting. 
 The cards are getting cold! 
 Be right there. 
 Leg is swollen and cold to the touch. 
 T-The skin is tight. 
 I'm worried it's compartment syndrome. 
 It really, really hurts. 
 No distal pulse, more pain than a standard break. 
 You're right. Her leg's filling with blood. 
 Dispatch, this is Aid Car 19. 
 We need a destination for a compartment syndrome victim. 
 Do you copy? 
 Do you copy? 
 Damn it. I can't get through. 
 Dispatch is down. 
 Roads are blocked. 
 Last we heard, Grey-Sloan was inaccessible. 
 What if... What if we can't get her to a hospital in time? 
 In time? 
 For what? 
 Shannon, the fracture in your leg is causing blood to rapidly pool within your limb, and your skin... can't stretch quickly enough, so... 
 So... So that means... It means we might have to cut your leg open right now... 
 Oh... to relieve some of the pressure. 
 Uh, okay, uh, so what happens if you don't? 
 What happens if you don't? 
 You could lose your leg. 
 I don't want to lose my leg. I don't want to lose my leg! 
 We don't want that to happen, either. 
 Pushing another round of morphine. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 Keep breathing for me, Shannon. 
 All right. 
 Lidocaine. 
 Damn it! Breathe, Shannon. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, steady now. 
 I got you. 
 You ready? 
 All right, structure is stabilized as much as possible under these conditions. 
 Getting close. I think. 
 I should've called 911 earlier. 
 
 
 
 I just needed a minute away from everything inside the house. 
 This is your margarita station. I get it. 
 Hey. Just to be clear, I-I was not drinking and driving. 
 Look. My family's complicated, too. 
 That's why I take it upon myself every Thanksgiving to set up a margarita station. 
 I get all my ingredients... 
 Fresh lime, agave, three kinds of rock salt. 
 You'd be surprised how much time it takes to mix a proper margarita. 
 So, basically, you... you ditch your family, like, all day? 
 No, I remove myself from the fray. 
 Everybody's happy with the guy who brings them their 'rita. 
 And I'm happy just not being in the middle of the rest. 
 Ma'am, it is really not safe for you to be out here. 
 Uh-huh. Here. 
 Your mom insisted I bring you a snack plate in case you were hungry because, apparently, she thinks my job is to feed and dote on everyone else in the household. 
 Including her. 
 Including you. 
 You're a grown man, Jimmy. 
 You can get your own snacks for yourself. 
 I mean, not at the moment. 
 Did you tell your mom she could move in? 
 What? No. 
 I-I mean, she, uh, mentioned she would be willing if, you know, we wanted, but... 
 Temporarily to help with the babies. 
 But she doesn't help with the babies. 
 She just tries to point out all the things I do she doesn't like with the babies. 
 That's it. Battery's dead. 
 But you kind of do that, too, to her. 
 They're not her babies! 
 Jimmy, I love you. 
 Even when you get yourself stuck in a freakin' carport, I love you. 
 But I swear, if you let her move in, she will unhinge her jaw and swallow me whole. 
 Oh, there you are. 
 Wait, wait. 
 Oh, there you are. 
 Okay. 
 She's in there right now. 
 Picking up our kids. Undoing all our sleep training... 
 No! They're supposed to cry it out! 
 Are we allowed to cry it out? 
 Damn it, Ruth! 
 Come on. Ready? 
 I know this is strictly professional work right now, but I love having chainsaw power in my hands! 
 Nothing wrong with loving the job. 
 Professionally. 
 I'm ready to professionally kick this tree's ass. 
 I think I'm ready to professionally kick it with you. 
 Ready for more? 
 Hell, yeah. Yeah. 
 Hang on. Do you smell that? 
 That smell like smoke? 
 Wait, stop. Come on. We're almost there. 
 No, do you smell that? 
 That's not good. 
 Hey, what's going on? 
 All right, I'm the fastest. 
 I'll run back to the truck, grab BAs, bottles, and hose lines... Anything I can carry. 
 Uh... we got another problem. 
 Get those people out of that house. 
 And, Miller, get Jimmy outta that damn car. 
 She's all bandaged up. 
 The meds have kicked in. She's resting. 
 This is Aid 19. 
 Do you copy? 
 So, what do we do? 
 Well, Grey-Sloan is about 20 minutes from here, unless the roads are blocked. 
 Rainier First Hospital's further, but we should wait for the all-clear. 
 Don't judge. 
 I was supposed to get Friendsgiving. 
 I haven't eaten all day, so if we're waiting around for an all-clear... 
 "Huh" what? 
 Just... seems a little like we're sharing a meal together right now. 
 I know you think I'm, uh... closed off. 
 You're right. I am. 
 I wasn't always. 
 What changed? 
 Something bad happened to me. 
 To my "people." 
 Or, my... my person, I guess. 
 Right here on this street. 
 She didn't fare as well as Shannon back there. 
 I thought enough time had passed. 
 I didn't know that coming back to Seattle would have... hit me this hard. 
 Come in. This is Aid 19. 
 Are we clear for transport? 
 Negative, Aid 19. 
 All roads to Grey-Sloan Memorial are blocked. 
 Is there another hospital? Anywhere we can get to? 
 Copy? 
 Still no service. 
 Dispatch, this is Aid 19. 
 Do you copy?! 
 Is this thing moving? 
 Okay, we won't be safe here much longer. 
 What do you think, Lieutenant? 
 I-I think screw Dispatch. 
 We gotta get out of here. Agreed. 
 Let's go. 
 This is Aid 19. 
 If anyone can hear us, we're diverting to Rainier First Hospital. 
 Over. 
 When someone asks why the candied yams don't have any marshmallows, one of you is explaining. 
 I'm gonna raise. 
 What's the update, Gibson? 
 Nothing. Same as before. 
 Winds are at 87 miles per hour now. 
 Lines are down all over the city. 
 Whole lot of power out, and I haven't heard anything from any of our people out there. 
 Because everybody knows what they're doing. 
 They'll call you if they need anything. 
 You sure are quiet. 
 Just playing the game. 
 Yeah, I don't think so. I recognize that look. 
 It's the same face you had as a kid when I found out you stole my credit card to buy a plane ticket. Really? 
 Yeah, you should've gotten in so much trouble for that, but I guess I didn't really have the heart. 
 I was kind of proud. I mean, you did do it for love. 
 We really don't need to talk about this right now. 
 He was really clever about it, too. 
 He distracts me first. 
 Then, he takes my wallet, credit card... 
 Sounds like Ryan doesn't want to talk about this. 
 No, you gotta hear this. Listen, he did it for Andy. 
 That's what the ticket was for... 
 To get her to New York after the Towers came down. 
 That's how she got there? I didn't know you did that. 
 Let's just keep playing or something. 
 A guy can brag on his own kid, can't he, a little bit? 
 He's a cop. You know, you keep bringing up this story about how he broke the law. 
 Gibson. He's been clear about not wanting to talk about it. 
 I'm just kidding around. Hey! 
 Sorry. No, screw you! 
 Hey, hey, hey, hold... Whoa, hey! 
 Hey, Gibson, enough! 
 Mary?! Ruth?! 
 Where are you? 
 We need to evacuate you immediately! 
 Mary! 
 Mary, come on! We gotta go! 
 No! The twins! We gotta go! 
 The twins! 
 Where are they? I'll get them. 
 Upstairs in the nursery with Ruth. 
 Please! Come on! 
 No! Oh, God! Come on! 
 Ruth! 
 Ruth!! In here! 
 Ruth! 
 Can you stand? 
 Take the little ones. I'll be fine. 
 I-I-I tried to get them downstairs. 
 I need you to follow me. Stay on my heels, okay? 
 I'll get you all out. Go on. Take the babies. 
 I'll follow. 
 I'm right behind you. 
 All right, Jimmy. One more pull, and I think we're out. 
 Hey, Trav. Where's Warren? 
 I'm going back in. 
 Montgomery! 
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! 
 Where... Where's Ruth? 
 She made me get the babies out, but... 
 Bishop's coming back with the bottles. 
 Don't go back in there without air... 
 There's no time! Warren, no! 
 Warren! 
 Warren!! 
 This is Warren. 
 Front bedroom, second floor, one female victim. 
 I have no exit. 
 Repeat, I have no exit. 
 You just stay right there. 
 Okay. 
 Warren, just hang on! 
 We're here. We have bottles. 
 Shallow breaths. Conserve your air. 
 If we can just hang on... 
 Here! Oh, my God! 
 Ruth, are... are you okay? Is she okay? 
 Ruth! Breathe into this! You're okay. 
 The babies? They're safe. 
 They're just fine, Ruth. Thanks to you. 
 You made sure they got out. 
 Mom! 
 Ma, are you okay? No, of course she's not okay. 
 She has severe smoke inhalation. 
 That's a very serious condition. 
 She needs air and space. 
 Don't you go aggravating her. 
 She's in a very fragile state. 
 All right, our job's not done! 
 Montgomery, get our vics into our vehicles for shelter. 
 Miller, Hughes, let's get this fire out. 
 Warren, nice job in there. 
 Dispatch. This is Chief Ripley. 
 Conditions have escalated. 
 If you're inside a station, stay there. 
 If you're out, take your victims and get them to a shelter immediately. 
 Seattle FD is officially grounded until further notice. 
 I am so glad to see you. 
 Hey! Thank God you're okay. 
 What happened out there? Well... 
 We saved a family. It was a lot, and it smells amazing in here. 
 Well, I've been stress prepping basically this entire time. 
 Good news is this might be my masterpiece meal. 
 I'll go get cleaned up. All right. 
 Hey, uh, when Greg said that thing earlier about my ring, does it bug you that I still wear it? 
 No. I understand. 
 It's not a thing for me. Okay, good. 
 Never seen myself as a person who'll ever actually get married, so it's all good. 
 Hey, there's two types of stuffing, by the way... 
 Cornbread and Rice Krispie. 
 Hurry up. Food's almost ready. 
 Well, I'm not gonna lie. 
 You looked pretty good wielding a chainsaw. 
 So did you. 
 Wanna lock the door? 
 No matter how much I would like to, I can't. 
 I'd be taking advantage... 
 No, you really wouldn't be. I'm the Chief. 
 You're... You're you. 
 Taking advantage implies a lack of consent on my part. 
 I'm a grown woman standing here consenting. 
 I'm the definition of consent. 
 You were hot today. 
 I-I... I was hot. 
 Don't stand there and try to tell me you're not feeling exactly the same way. 
 I am done being professional right now. 
 And I think you are, too. 
 Lock... the door. 
 You need to settle. 
 No, I'm fine. No, you're not. 
 I'm fine. Just stop moving for a minute. 
 When did this start? Right after the skyscraper? 
 I think I'm just tired. 
 I just need to lie down or something, okay? 
 Gibson, I have been around a long time. 
 I've seen versions of this before. 
 It isn't safe for you to... Just let me sleep! 
 You can't ignore it. 
 Table's all set. You gonna come eat something? 
 There's something you need to know. 
 They found me, didn't they? 
 Warrant was issued this morning. 
 I figured that might be what you were sitting on all day. 
 I knew it was something. 
 The way I see it, I have two options. 
 Either I take you in now like I should've this morning... 
 Or? Or... 
 I let you walk out the front door, no questions asked. 
 And we never speak to each other again. 
 So, what are you gonna do? 
 Hey, uh, I'm sorry I wasn't more enthusiastic about your Friendsgiving today. 
 It wasn't about you. 
 I just can't remember a family gathering where I didn't make my margaritas. 
 Now my dad's not returning my calls, so it's just weird to know they'll be having the get-together this year with... 
 I hear that. Yeah. 
 Oh, it pairs. 
 Should we wait for everybody or...? 
 No, no. Eat it now when it's ready. 
 Great. Yes! 
 Yes! 
 Oh, yeah! No, of course! 
 Actually, I have something I'd prefer not to keep from you any longer. 
 You sure as hell can't control the storm if it's coming... 
 It's not official yet, but, uh... after everything we did today together... 
 not to take this opportunity to announce that... 
 Maya Bishop will be promoted to Lieutenant very soon. 
 Hey, hey! All right! 
 All right! All right! 
 There's an opening at Station 23. 
 I've already put in the word for the transfer. 
 Congratulations, Bishop. 
 I can't take your call right now. 
 Oh, no! 
 Oh, voicemail. 
 Andy, I need to talk to you. 
 Your "Freaky Friday" swapping-places thing worked, um, maybe too well, and now I have some news that is both... amazing and... absolutely not. 
 And, uh... 
 I can't believe you're with Sullivan right now and I have this to tell you. 
 Where are you? 
 Call me. 
 You can prepare, you can stay ready... 
 that this storm... 
 won't be your last.
