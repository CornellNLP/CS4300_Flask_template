 Previously on "Station 19"... 
 Captains have to balance what's moral and what's practical. 
 And while I would never want to squash another woman to win this, I will. 
 You punched the wrong code into the security system, and it automatically shut all the doors. 
 I don't know what got you so distracted that you made a mistake like that, but next time -- There won't be a next time. 
 If we're gonna try this, I need to go slow. 
 I think I'm scared of fire. 
 I stop. I freeze up. 
 Okay. I can get to it. Maya -- 
 Maya! 
 Why did you do that? 
 Huh? 
 I didn't support you or Jack for the Captain position. 
 Andy: People call us heroes. 
 But if you ask any firefighter, we're the first to say, "No, we're not heroes. 
 We're not superhuman. We're just regular people. 
 We have flaws. We have fears. 
 We just show up every day and do our job. That's it." 
 It doesn't make us heroes. 
 Andy, it's too much. You can't make it to her. 
 The hell I can't. Andy, no! 
 Somebody has to. 
 -Ohh. Mnh. -You are a terrible influence. 
 Charlotte: I told you, I don't usually sleep over. Mnh. 
 ♪♪ Dearborn? 
 Was she there when we got in last night? 
 Why are you with her? 
 It was Wednesday. I treat myself to self-care on Wednesdays, usually in the form of a one-night stand. 
 Has anyone seen my pants? 
 Why her? Dearborn, Station 12. 
 Yeah, we weren't really focused on names. 
 What she means is I kicked her ass in the Incinerator. 
 Big day today, Herr. 
 Of course, it's probably bigger for you than me. 
 You got a lot more to make up for in your Ripley sit-down. 
 For me, it's kind of just a matter of red tape since he loves me. 
 I'm very lovable. 
 Especially when I do that one thing with my other thing...

 Good, 'cause, otherwise, you might have just ruined my last day as captain. 
 Your last day officially not getting the title. 
 Which we both know that probably won't happen with what my dad said to Ripley. 
 What do you need right now? A pep talk? No talk? 
 I'm here for either. You tell me. 
 I just want to enjoy what I have while I have it.

 I don't like the idea of all the other candidates being in our space, all up in our business. 
 Me either. 
 You didn't seem to mind too much last night. 
 I told you, I didn't know who she was! 
 Wait. Hang on. Did I just miss something? 
 What did I just miss? 
 Okay. What are you gonna say in your meeting today, if you've decided you've already lost this thing? 
 What? No! 
 No, no, no. Wrong attitude. Don't think that. 
 I'm just gonna be true to myself, all right? 
 That's all I can do. Okay, hey. 
 I am sensing some resignation here, and I don't like it. 
 The Incinerator may have been bad, but that doesn't mean you're completely out of the running. 
 Why would you think that way? 
 You know, just a hunch, I guess. 
 Well, we might've bought the whole store. 
 That's what I get for going shopping with a professional chef. 
 Grant, did you wake up at his place? 
 'Cause, if so, that is huge. 
 He never lets anybody sleep over. 
 Okay, this was on his way to work... I -- Oh. 
 ...and I needed the extra hands, and that's it. 
 Okay, that's it? 
 That's it. 
 Loving this view. 
 Listen, there's something I wanted to talk to you about when you get a minute. Like what? 
 Well, I think it's great. And I am anxiously waiting for my invitation to come be a third wheel at any one of your gourmet-cooked meals. 
 Are we still on for next week? 
 Next week? What's next week? 
 Maya's trying to convince me and Vic to try aerial yoga. 
 -Ugh. -You and...oh, okay. 
 You guys are making plans. That's cool. 
 That's, uh, totally not weird and strange. 
 Okay, time to go. I will walk you out. 
 Ah, okay. 
 Bye. 
 ♪♪ You just got weird. 
 What? No. 
 Do you not want me talking to your friends or something? 
 I ju-- I -- 
 I guess I didn't realize that you already were talking to them and making plans with them. 
 Is that a problem? 
 I told you, if you need things to go more slowly, all you have to do is say it. 
 Yeah, no, I-I know. 
 I don't want to play games. Just be honest. 
 I'd respect that. 
 What I don't respect is you not actually talking to me. 
 I'm looking for something real. 
 And it's fine if you're not that guy, really. 
 I'm not expecting everything all at once. 
 But I do expect respect. 
 Hey. Hey, Grant -- 
 I'll see myself out. 
 -...and me. -Yeah. 
 Hey. Hey. How you doing, man? 
 The thing is, they asked me to bring breakfast tacos from Madre's. 
 If I walk in there empty-handed, I'll never live it down. 
 Well, they can't expect you to move mountains if the mountains are closed for renovations. 
 Look, I am the rookie. 
 It's my job to do this stuff. 
 Okay, you may be the rookie, but you are also a genuine, certified, accomplished surgeon who already paid his dues. 
 And they should appreciate that, not waste your time sending you on impossible errands. 
 You are very sexy when you're defending my honor. 
 Oh, I'm sexy all the damn time. 
 And not too afraid to go tell your boss nobody treats my husband like this. 
 N-No. N-No. No, Miranda! 
 Herrera! 
 He's all yours. 
 Okay, guys, I'm sorry. 
 I wasn't able to get the tacos that you wanted. 
 Yeah, we know. 
 That place has been closed for a month. 
 We just wanted to make sure that you were late. 
 ♪♪ Oh. 
 Okay, what's happening? 
 As of last week, you have officially run into 50 fires. 
 And you have run out of 50 fires not dead, so congrats. 
 I, for sure, thought that you'd be back at your cushy little surgery gig by now. 
 Well, either that or crispy fried. 
 I'm sorry. 
 50 fires is a big rite of passage. 
 Congratulations, Warren. 
 I mean, I'd seen, like, 50 fires in probably half the time. 
 Well, open it already! 
 Keys to the Aid Car. You get to drive it now. 
 I get to drive? 
 I get to drive. 
 Boom! Whoa. 
 No, see, rookies don't get to drive. 
 New guys don't drive. You -- 
 I drive now. Me. 
 And I eat. 
 Will look pretty good behind the wheel, don't you think? 
 Uh, right now, you're acting like a grown man excited about a big toy. 
 No speeding. 
 I'm so proud of you. 
 -Whoa! 
 And I wish I could stay, but, uh, I got to go cut people open. 
 Oh, uh, am I gonna see you for your appointment later? 
 It's just the -- the usual stuff, shouldn't take too long. 
 I'll be there. 
 Okay, how did you all even know that I passed my driving test? 
 We're family. We keep track of stuff like that. 
 Also, Vic might've figured out how to crack your e-mail password. 
 It's "Hot Hot Miranda," if anyone's curious. 
 I'll be changing that today. 
 Can you pass the bacon? 
 All right. 
 ♪♪ 
 Andrea? 
 Andrea. 
 Andrea, we need to talk. 
 I'm not ready yet. 
 I'll wind up saying something I don't mean to say. 
 But I hope you understand I'm -- 
 I wasn't trying to hurt you by talking to Ripley. 
 You know, you're entitled to your opinion about me. 
 But the fact that you tanked Jack, too -- you'd leave the entire station open for an outsider to come in and take over... It could be a good thing. 
 ...instead of having a little faith in our team -- the team you built -- and some trust that we could make it work. 
 I expected you to believe in us as our captain. 
 And as my dad... 
 ♪♪ I guess I just thought that... 
 ♪♪ I'd hoped you had faith in me, too. 
 I'm sorry, Andrea. I know you're angry. 
 You have every right to be. 
 Yeah, but you're not sorry about what you said to Ripley. 
 ♪♪ Andrea -- That's what I thought. 
 ♪♪ 
 Can't believe the captain's race is almost over. 
 It's kind of crazy. 
 Not even sure of what I'll say to Ripley when I'm in there. 
 I think I stood a better chance with Frankel. 
 Skyscraper fire downtown. 
 Sweet! 
 Oh, hey, Herrera. 
 Don't be nervous. Warmed him up for you. 
 Sir? 
 Panel interviews are postponed until further notice. 
 I'm needed at this skyscraper fire. 
 Sorry, guys. 
 -Yes, sir. -Of course. 
 Andy. 
 So you know, if I don't get captain, I'm putting in for a transfer. 
 A transfer? What? Why? 
 I mean, it's pretty simple. 
 I got some regrets about things that have happened and... Regrets? 
 ...and I'd rather start fresh... 
 ♪♪ 
 ...somewhere else. 
 You know, I think it'd be better all around. 
 ♪♪ 
 ♪♪ 
 -Hey. -What's up? 
 Can't believe we haven't been called on that skyscraper yet. 
 I hate the waiting. 
 Yeah, while we're waiting, um... 
 This is weirdly hard. 
 It's the worst. 
 We have to sit here waiting until Ripley pulls the trigger. 
 We should just get it over with, you know? 
 You're my guy. Or you used to be my guy. 
 And then we sort of stopped hanging out. 
 And then, we stopped talking. 
 And I-I just figured that you were too busy, and you were too busy with Herrera. 
 And now...it's weird. 
 And talking to you is weird. 
 And -- And it never used to be weird. 
 Talk to me about what? 
 Hey. Group meeting in the barn, guys. 
 It's fine. It can wait. 
 Let's do this thing! 
 Dispatcher: Two additional units requested. 
 Partial evacuation currently in progress. 
 All right, check these carefully. 
 It's been a while since we needed to pull this many hoses. 
 Radios are tuned in. Alerts are on. 
 Only a matter of time till they call us in. 
 Looks like the structural fire originated on the 24th floor. 
 25th is currently 0% contained. Over. 
 0%? Still? 
 Why aren't they calling us in now? 
 I wish they would. 
 I am ready to get in there and tackle this monster. 
 Switch it up! 
 You know, it's good to get in there later, too. 
 A lot of other units in there already, so... 
 Warren, what makes a high-rise like this different from other structure fires? 
 The roof can't be vented. 
 Internal containment's the name of the game. 
 ♪♪ Using fire doors, concentrated wet-downs, just trying to keep the blaze as small as we can, contain it to the floor. 
 We'll all need to remember, conserve energy. 
 In a building this tall, you can usually use the elevators if you don't jump the fire line. 
 Fire in the elevator shaft opens us up to a whole new world of problems. 
 Great. Any of us drop in there, you know the rules -- we save firefighter lives first. 
 All right, so take breaks if you need them or you might contribute to the problem instead of the solution. 
 Nobody likes a hero. Understood? 
 -Got it. -Understood! 
 Chief's calling Station 71 in, copy. 
 Oh, I just want to get in there! 
 Reporter: The firefighters are currently battling the fire on floors 24... I just want to get in there! 
 Well, maybe they won't need us. 
 I mean, if we never get called in, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. 
 It's worse than the worst. 
 That would kill my soul. 
 We have four companies responding and ready to call in more if we need them. 
 And I can report there have been no deaths. 
 Jack said if he doesn't make captain, he's transferring. 
 By choice? Why would anyone leave 19? 
 He thinks it'll be easier. 
 -He says he has regrets. 
 He'll regret starting over from scratch at some lame, brand-new station with lame, brand-new people. 
 And guess who's not lame? Us. 
 I never wanted any of this. To make him leave? 
 I mean, I can't even imagine this place without him. 
 I-I don't really want to. 
 If he leaves, can I have his locker? 
 His boots are super stinky. 
 Well, we should go get a power nap. 
 Rest while we can before they call us in. 
 Yeah, sure. Absolutely. 
 It's so hard to look away, though. 
 Man: Can we come over here real quick 
 -and ask a few questions? -Yes. 
 Five more minutes. Yes. Thank you. 
 You realize it doesn't have racing stripes? 
 Oh, I bet you were just as excited when you got your first turn. 
 I don't know if I was this excited. 
 You know, the last time I remember feeling like this was my first solo surgery. 
 I mean, it was a routine tonsillectomy, but it was a sign that I was doing something right. 
 I was moving forward. 
 No turning back after that. 
 Oh, I can't wait to drive my first patient to the hospital. 
 Miranda watching me pull up into the breezeway with my patient that I drove. 
 I just hope it's something good, you know, like a -- like a triple-A. 
 Something that she could -- she'd really enjoy. 
 You're lucky... having that person to share things with. 
 Even if the things you're sharing are emergent abdominal surgeries. 
 You've got that person. You've got Grant. 
 Yeah, I think I'm messing that up. 
 He kind of snapped at me earlier, and he was right. 
 I was acting weird. 
 I don't know, man. It's hard for me. 
 It's complicated. 
 Look, it -- it doesn't have to be. 
 Look, e-either he's the guy that you want to share everything with, or he's not. 
 Doesn't have to be any more complicated than that. 
 ♪♪ I think it's complicated for me because... 
 I haven't felt the way he makes me feel in a long time. 
 Oh. 
 So tell him. 
 Just like that. Yes, just like that. 
 W-We go to this call, I drive this damn rig, we have a good freaking day, and then you tell him. 
 ♪♪ It does sound like a pretty good day. 
 Oh, it is a very good day, Montgomery. 
 We are claiming it!

 Oh! Structural fire. 
 Full response needed.

 Andy: Okay, here's what we know. 
 Chief Ripley's operating from Base Camp three floors below the fire. 
 Multiple companies have already been hitting this thing since morning -- it's still only 10% contained. 
 Get in there. Fight smart and fight safe. 
 But, mostly, let's just fight this damn thing. 
 ♪♪ 
 Ryan, what are you doing here? 
 You guys were overwhelmed with evacuations. 
 Some of us decided to come down, pitch in where we can. 
 Which we appreciate. But you're almost tagged out, all right? 
 Listen up! I don't want anyone exposed to this smoke and debris for too long, understood? Okay? 
 Station 19, excellent response time. 
 Now, containment's up to 15%, but it's slow going. 
 I need most of you on the active fire, Floor 25, to relieve Company 7. 
 We could use your Aid Car team down here on triage. 
 No problem. You got it. 
 And I need two of you on crowd control on Floor 28. 
 We're still holding about 100 civilians. 
 As you know, it's safer to keep them above the fire line. 
 Hughes and I will take 28. 
 Thank you. What? Really? 
 You've been waiting all day to go after this thing. 
 Nah, go shine for Ripley. 
 Hughes and I can handle the civies. 
 All right, 19. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. 
 Thank you. Hey, right behind you. 
 Wait up. Ooh, you look beat. 
 Don't you want to take a break? 
 And let you have all the fun? 
 The chief watching? Not a chance. 
 Race ya! 
 ♪♪ Told ya. Tons of fun. Whoo-hoo! 
 Easy, Dearborn. It's not a drill. 
 Digging her energy. 
 I could do without it. 
 Station 7, we're relieving you. 
 Copy that. Careful in here. Debris is falling pretty bad. 
 All right, let's keep it slow and steady, guys. 
 I have been there -- like, all day, been there. 
 Slow and steady's all we've been doing. 
 Do you think we should get in there? I mean, I -- 
 Yeah, and make some headway. Go big or go home, right? 
 There's a break in the fire. 
 -Yeah, I see it. -It's not very big. 
 Big enough. 
 If I can get to a fire door, that may give us a better handle over this part of the fire. 
 Closing the fire door would probably help, but -- 
 Then we're agreed! But it's too risky! 
 Damn it, Dearborn! 
 Whoa-oh! She made it! 
 Aah! 
 Dearborn, are you okay? 
 ♪♪ Dearborn, repeat. Confirm you're okay.

 Help me lift this thing so I can pull her out. 
 That smoke ball thingy -- oh, it's awesome! 
 So was that throw, Herrera! 
 When I'm running 19, I am making you pitcher of the softball team. 
 Yeah, a simple "thank you" would be fine. 
 It looks like that sphere gave us a major hold on the fire. 
 There's still fire in the ceiling, though. 
 Could be spreading out. 
 Then you and Miller should go check on 26. 
 Hey, hey, hey. You can't put weight on it. 
 It's okay to step out. Oh, no. No way. 
 I'm not stepping out with Ripley downstairs weighing my every move. 
 I told you -- 
 This is Herrera. I've got an injured firefighter on 25. 
 We're coming down. Send two more to replace us. 
 Man: Copy that, Herrera. 
 You are so loving this. 
 A little bit. 
 -Oh, hello. Hi. -Hi. 
 Um, I'm Molly. 
 I'm the fire evacuation coordinator for my office. 
 Station 19. Um... 
 Ooh, you guys are way outside of the district. 
 So this must be a pretty big fire then if they had to call you guys in. 
 Molly, I know it feels counterintuitive to stay up here right now. 
 "Panic stampede running past floors of fire and smoke is likely to cause more injuries than good. 
 If instructed, gather your floor in a common space until the fire department gives the all-clear." 
 Oh, see, it's in Section 3 of my coordinator manual. 
 She's a mini Herrera. 
 Oh, shoot! 
 Last names "G" through "M," it's time for your restroom break. 
 I-I've got a list of everyone on this floor. 
 And I also have a first aid kit. 
 Whatever you need, I'm -- I'm here. 
 Okay. Well, we need to do a sweep and check for smoke. 
 So you think you can cover the stairwell for a little bit? 
 Yes. On it. 
 Make sure you get this X-rayed. 
 Tell me what's going on. 
 I was on the floor when the fire started. 
 Ohh. Tried to make a run for it before I got trapped. 
 You got a partial thickness burn. 
 I'll give you something for the pain, and I'll get you on the next trip down, okay? 
 I was supposed to pick my kid up early. 
 But I got pulled onto this work thing tonight, so I canceled. 
 Oh, she was so upset. I felt awful. 
 I should've just gone. Why didn't I go? 
 Sure, okay, you got trapped for a minute by some fire, and you got out. 
 These burns will get better. 
 You will get to go home to your kid tonight. 
 That makes today a very good day. 
 See, Montgomery and I here, we already decided. Yes, we did! 
 We decided today may be scary, but it's not bad -- it's good. 
 You're getting out of here. 
 Today's a good day, okay? 
 No smoke. 
 No smoke. 
 Thank you, by the way, for volunteering us for the floor with no fire. 
 Are any of the drills helping? 
 I think I see an improvement, but maybe that's just wishful thinking. 
 You know, that thing with Jack leaving the station, if I don't get over my fear soon, that'll be me, too. 
 I'll have to quit. 
 You'll get over your fear. 
 Haven't yet. 
 Why does it feel like the band is breaking up? 
 Well, at least you're not the one leaving the band. 
 Andy will still be here, even if she's not in charge. 
 I always pictured Andy and me running this place together, not me and somebody else. 
 But you -- 
 I'm getting out of here right now. 
 Mr. Sorensen, I've told you, I can't let anyone leave this floor as fire evacuation captain. 
 The building is on fire! 
 And you and your stupid vest cannot keep me here! 
 She can, actually. 
 See, right now, the fire department is in charge of this building. 
 And we put Molly in charge of this door. 
 Would you like to sit somewhere? 
 Maybe get a bag to breathe into? 
 -Yeah? 
 Let's check the rest of these vents along the floor, make sure they're not hiding any more flare-ups.

 We need evac. What can we do? 
 I can't send the elevator past the fire line, and the stairwells are full of black smoke, but there's a PPV fan on Floor 27.
