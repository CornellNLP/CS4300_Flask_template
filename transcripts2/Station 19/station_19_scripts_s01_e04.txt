 Previously on "Station 19"... 
 Stay focused, ready -- I said I've got it! 
 You don't have to coach me. 
 I can handle things with Jack myself. 
 Jack: Do you just not want to get married? 
 Do you not want to get married to me? 
 Vic: I've never gotten that close before, knowing it could all be over. 
 Prolonged smoke exposure, so the airway's burning. 
 Keep an eye on his lungs. 
 JJ. Are you okay? Seth died. 
 I fought my way up, and I didn't have anything handed to me by my daddy. 
 She should've made lead lieutenant years ago. 
 Andy has earned her spot. 
 Andy: It doesn't actually take that much to start a fire. 
 You need three things. 
 Heat, oxygen, and fuel. 
 Lots of fuel. 
 Deborah: We open tomorrow. 
 Are you just gonna sit there and drink wine and let me do all the work? 
 I thought when your divorce was finalized and you said, "Sue, let's open up this cute, little bed & breakfast," there'd be a lot more bed and a lot more breakfast. 
 Would it kill you to help me put this wine away in the racks? 
 And after that fire's started once... 
 In a minute. I want to open another bottle. 
 No. No. You're not! 
 You are going to stock this wine, and I am going to bake more welcome cookies for the B&B which you seem to think will run itself. 
 I swear, you are the worst sister. 
 Literally the worst! 
 ...it needs even less to catch fire again.

 Uh-oh. 
 Why is it every time I start my shift, I get slammed with a mountain of surprises? 
 What surprises? New boots? 
 You approved new boots? 
 We needed some. Everybody wanted them. 
 With mid-sole support that decreases foot fatigue and a side zipper. 
 ♪ I got a feeling that I can't lose ♪ It's... 
 It's a big expense, Jack. 
 The kind of decision co-captains might discuss and eventually cosign, unless one of the captains thought they no longer had to discuss decisions with the other captain because he felt he was somehow already captain. 
 Just boots, Herrera. Just boots. 
 I don't like to talk -- 
 You think we won't get the new boots now? 
 No, new boots are not worth this. 
 They've been bickering all week. 
 Bishop, you speak "Herrera." 
 Go make it stop. 
 Well, she is tired of me interfering. 
 She told me to back off. You were there. 
 I'm backing. 
 Oh, no, don't back. This is Bishop. 
 Don't back. Backing is bad. 
 No, I'm not getting in the middle of that. Nah, I'm good. Mnh-mnh. 
 And not to mention the steak dinner you served last shift. 
 I now have to re-stock the pantry, probably with powdered milk. 
 The team needed a pick-me-up. 
 You're making this a whole deal. No deal. 
 I just don't appreciate you pulling these "Fun Dad" moves with the steaks and the boots when we both know I have a bigger hill to climb here. 
 What hill? With Frankel! 
 I heard what she said to you, Jack. 
 You did? 
 She made it pretty clear this was your race to lose. 
 I'm not going down without a fight. 
 Did you hear me tell Frankel that you'd make an excellent captain? 
 You bet your ass I would. 
 Or that you should have made lieutenant a long time ago? 
 I don't need you propping me up. 
 I'm not propping you up, Andy. It's true. 
 I can fight my own battles. 
 We all know that, Andy. Good! 
 I definitely know that. Okay. 
 Can you stop? Stop what? 
 Fighting! Yes. 
 Stop fighting. Yes. 
 You sure? Can you? 
 I can. I can, too.

 For a moment, I thought I'd be upgrading these. 
 A fleeting, beautiful moment. 
 I need an opinion. 
 And even when I polish them, they're still so dull. 
 Look at these. Definitely seen better days. 
 So, I-I got this friend who's sort of interested in somebody. 
 But she just broke up with somebody else. 
 Now, my friend wants to know -- 
 By "friend," do you mean you? 
 And by "someone," do you mean JJ? 
 Maybe. 
 So, by "broke up," you mean died? 
 What's the appropriate waiting period on that? 
 Do you think she needs time to -- to get over her... you know. 
 Her bang-buddy. 
 Her booty cutie. Never mind. 
 s*x amigo! Forget I asked. 
 Asked what? 
 I know many things about many things, Miller. 
 Hazmat indicators, disaster response team, containment initiatives -- a wealth of knowledge sitting at reception all day, every day. 
 So, how can I help? What did you want to know? 
 Basically, he wants to get laid. 
 ♪♪ S-Sir? 
 So, the trick is to find the center point and hang the lines so they dry evenly and don't mildew. 
 You think that once we finish here, we could take a break and, uh, go try the VR Fire Simulation Goggles that Jack got? 
 This is not an amusement park, Warren. 
 You're training here. Stay on task. 
 It could also be part of my training. 
 The -- The graphics are supposed to be so real that it feels like physical heat. 
 Oh, are you asking me to run extra drills with you, voluntarily, in a video game? 
 More like a completely immersive training experience, but, um, yeah. 
 Absolutely not. 
 Andy: This is exactly the opposite of how I thought today was gonna go. 
 You and me both. 
 Not complaining. 
 And it beats fighting. 
 Finally, something we can agree on. 
 Maybe we should... talk about this? 
 Absolutely. 
 Maybe later? Not right now. 
 Okay. You leave first and, um, just slam the door like you're mad.

 You were not this earlier. 
 This morning, you were all and And now... 
 Was it Jack? 
 Did he do this to you? 
 What? 
 No. 
 Oh. Did he mess up the captain race? 
 Oh, did he piss Frankel off? 
 Come on. I want to hear all about it. 
 Deets. Go. Look, Corn on sale. 
 Now, I-I believe it's my turn to cook today, in which case, I vote we splurge on these. 
 I make a mean truffle risotto. 
 Can't splurge. 
 Not after Gibson... No. No. 
 ...went big on steaks during his last shift. 
 We're dipping into reserves. 
 -Put it back. -Less risotto, more Rice-A-Roni. 
 This morning, you were ripping Jack a new one about spending. 
 Now you don't say a word. 
 Vic's right. Something's up. 
 What gives? 
 Right. Not my race. 
 Stay in my lane. 
 Forget I brought it up. No, Maya, it's not what -- 
 We have full response needed. 479 Sunken Meadow Road.

 ♪♪ Vic: All right. Grab an extra fold of hose. 
 Enough to make some curves and avoid getting kinks in the line. 
 It's Gibson. We're here. 
 Who actually stays at a place like this? 
 I honeymooned in a place like this. 
 You would. 
 ♪♪ Clear! 
 Don't over-crank that coupling there. 
 Ready when you are, 19. 
 So, the oven lit up? 
 Huge flames shot out, and my mitt caught on fire. 
 And then you threw the mitt, which made the flames even crazier, instead of putting the mitt in the sink like a normal person would. 
 It's a normal reaction to giant flames shooting at my face. 
 Giant flames. Okay. Is anyone inside? 
 No, no. Our first guests arrive tomorrow. 
 It's the grand opening. 
 Everything we have is in there. 
 Let's get eyes on this. 
 Looks like a working structure fire. 
 Structure fire. Oh, my God, it's a structure fire! 
 Montgomery, Miller, run a hose line inside. 
 -Got it. -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Sir, we just completed our renovation, and every dime we have is in this place. 
 Could you please avoid using axes...and water? 
 You want us to avoid using water on a fire. 
 Yes.

 Hughes, Warren, do you copy? 
 Copy. The line's been compromised. 
 We need to run a new line right now. 
 Team in there's dry. 
 We've still got a water can and an extinguisher. 
 We'll use those. 
 Be careful in there! 
 We have limited resources, so don't get spray-happy. 
 If flames are too big, we don't grandstand. 
 We get out. 
 ♪♪ 
 I've seen campfires that were bigger. 
 Flag on that hose line, guys. Fire's out. 
 They're lucky it was a fire we could put out in one blast, Gibson. 
 So are you. Excuse me? 
 I told you to secure the line. 
 That was your job. You were on truck to protect the hose. 
 You're saying a popped line is my fault? 
 I'm saying you thought it was handled, and it wasn't. 
 Don't blame me for something I can't control. 
 You think they bought it? 
 You were very convincing. 
 Well, I-I guess I've had a little practice lately. 
 We both have. 
 ♪ I'm better at anything ♪ Think they're still out there listening? 
 Probably. 
 Being captain doesn't always make you right!

 No way, honey.

 He needs to be on top of this stuff. 
 Oh, please.

 I understand he's your grandson. 
 I have concerns, okay? 
 He can't just neglect your needs. 
 I'll speak to the facilities manager. 
 Oh, for God's sake, Montgomery, I didn't tell him about the bed, and I didn't tell him about my symptoms. 
 If he cares about you, he'll want to know. 
 Listen, he's finally working. 
 He comes to visit, sits in that chair, and tells me how happy he is. 
 Now, I don't want him worrying about me.

 Is it because of the coaching thing? 
 Are you upset about that? 
 Nope. 
 You can't help people who don't want it. 
 And even though I always try, I should know better. 
 It was an off-handed comment. 
 I was tired and frustrated. 
 I wasn't trying to... pull rank or anything. 
 But you've been out of sorts all day. 
 And you've been out of pocket. 
 Is it something I did or I-I said or...? 
 You know, not everything is about you. 
 Then tell me. Talk to me. 
 What's going on? 
 My dad spent all of his time and his money on me and my training. 
 The winning and the medals, they were like...a drug. 
 And Mason, he just -- 
 He got left behind. 
 And he tried. 
 He stopped running, started trying other things. 
 He got into art school, but my parents wouldn't pay for it. 
 He wasn't the prospect. 
 And I could see he was in pain, but we grew up embracing the pain. 
 I guess I thought it would make him stronger like me. 
 I won an Olympic gold medal, and the day I won was the first time that Mason OD'd. 
 And no one even knew about it because... he was home alone, and I was abroad with my parents. 
 ♪♪ 
 I feel like it's all my fault. 
 He's...my fault. 
 I can keep an eye on him. 
 When I'm on patrol. If you'd like.

 I was captain for a lot of years. 
 And I'm -- I'm not used to this, being part of the group, part of the conversation. 
 I-I've gotten used to being outside the conversation, looking in at a distance. 
 Uh, sir, you don't have to explain yourself to me. 
 You have to have that distance to lead. 
 But I don't want to be someone people don't come to. 
 I don't want to shut people out. 
 And leading, it's not what I do anymore. 
 It's -- So my advice is if you like the nice, young woman, just go to her.

 Ha.

 You know, um, when someone experiences something like, you know, Blue Fire, I'm sure it's not unusual for it to rattle you. 
 Excuse me? 
 I'm just saying, you know, the way the VR got to you, y-your reaction at the fire today -- 
 I'm sure you can work through it, but if I can help in any way, I would -- 
 Oh, you have no idea what you're talking about. 
 I do not have some fear of fire. 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 You know, that is -- that is not the kind of thing a person works through. 
 That's the kind of problem that turns a firefighter into a postal worker. 
 So let's be clear. 
 It is not a problem I have. 
 Okay. 
 You know, I was -- 
 I was the rookie like five minutes ago. 
 I'm still building my reputation, and there is no coming back from something like that, not in the eyes of the team. 
 I didn't mean -- And unlike you, I do not have a medical degree to fall back on. 
 So I do not have a problem. 
 Understood? 
 Travis: Hey. I was just down the hall. 
 Gary Shilabi fell off the piano bench again. 
 And I wanted to check in on your shoulder. 
 Yeah. I know why you're really here. 
 And the answer is still no. 
 Edith, I understand your hesitation, and I know that you think that you need to spare your grandson. 
 I do. Man: Spare me from what? 
 They were all out of strawberry, so...I brought orange and green flavors. 
 Well, Montgomery, pick up your jaw and say hello. 
 He's a looker, isn't he? 
 Love when she talks about me like I'm not here. 
 Hi. I'm Grant. 
 Travis. Hi. 
 Hi. Hey. Hello. 
 So, what was she neglecting to tell me? 
 I, uh -- It's... 
 It's not really my place. 
 Gran, what's going on? 
 Well, go on, Montgomery. 
 You say it better than I do. 
 Now you're making me nervous. 
 Andy: All it takes is a single spark to re-start a fire. 
 Your grandmother needs to see a physician very soon. 
 I've noticed over the past few months... she's exhibited some symptoms. 
 Sadly, re-ignition usually starts at the most inconvenient moments. 
 It catches. It takes hold. 
 Your sister came to see you, and I think you should take a couple minutes to talk to her.

 Thank God we found this again. 
 Andy. 
 The fire knows what it's doing. 
 Oh, no. 
 You -- You say my name like that, and I feel a-a pin in your hand about to pop the bubble. 
 Don't -- Don't pop it. 
 I don't think this is enough for me. 
 The fire knows its way, where to go, how to move. 
 Stop. 
 Let's just stop with the talking. 
 This is bubble time. 
 And it's incredible, but -- 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 But it's delaying the inevitable. 
 Thought that was the point. 
 I've been going along with this. 
 It's been fun. 
 It definitely beats fighting. 
 And it makes you happy. 
 It's already taking the path of least resistance. 
 But it doesn't make me happy. 
 And I-I can stand here and pretend it's something else, but I-I had a ring, and I wanted more. 
 And I still do. 
 Why are we talking about that? 
 'Cause we haven't. 
 Yeah, I know. So let's talk. 
 I don't want to. Why? 
 Because I don't want more, Jack. 
 I don't. 
 Not -- Not yet. 
 Not with you. Not with anyone. 
 I mean, maybe ever. 
 I mean, you think about the home you'll build with someone someday. 
 You imagine it. 
 ♪ There's a wildfire, fire, fire ♪ I-I have my home. 
 I found it already. 
 Here. With these people. 
 At this station. 
 I don't want something separate. 
 This is the home I know. 
 I'm -- I'm here. I'm not looking for more. 
 We were so good this morning. What -- What changed? 
 Those sisters. 
 Seeing how one couldn't live without the other. 
 All I could think was, "I feel that for Andy." 
 But she doesn't feel that way for me. 
 What, you think I don't care about you? 
 No, I did not say that. Of -- Of course I care, Jack. 
 God, you...know I do. 
 I j-- But I just -- I can't waste time not being true to myself. 
 Yeah, well, I can't waste time in a bubble. 
 But that's who we are. 
 We met in a bubble. 
 We fell for each other that way. 
 We work great in a bubble. 
 We are so good at taking off clothes and having fun and grabbing those moments whenever we can. 
 Can't we just be this? 
 Us? 
 In our incredible, happy, sexy, naked bubble?
