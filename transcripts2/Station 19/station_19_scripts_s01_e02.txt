 [SMOKE ALARM BEEPING] 
 ANDY:  Smoke alarms are one of the simplest   and most effective inventions. 
 [SMOKE ALARM BEEPING] 
 I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't. 
 Every time we get into it, that thing beeps. 
 [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
 See? 
 - It's just the battery. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 Ignore it. 
 They watch over us... 
 [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
 Mm, nope. Can't. Damn it! 
 I think it's broken. I just changed the batteries yesterday. 
 Maybe it knows something we don't. 
 Maybe we should be evacuating right now. 
 Unlikely. 
 You want me to change the batteries again? 
 No! What I want is an orgasm... a mind-blowing orgasm... with you and all your handsome nakedness. 
 But at this point, I'd settle for a gentle orgasmic wave or a happy little warm cup of cocoa-gasm... any of the gasms is what I want! 
 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 They sense things we can't. 
 They alert us when something's not right. 
 [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
 - Mnh! No! 
 - That's it. 
 Oh, okay.

 Morning, Bishop. 
 I'm assuming that smack talk was meant for me. 
 Hey. 
 - You ready for this? 
 - I'm ready. 
 FRANKEL: I have a very full schedule today, and you two are the least exciting things on it. 
 Let's go! 
 I hope you don't think by pulling out my chair and flashing me those big baby blues you're gonna make my heart go pitter-patter. 
 Absolutely not. 
 I do the same for Captain Pruitt. 
 Just a sign of respect. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Congratulations on your recent promotion, Herrera. 
 - Thank you. 
 - I remember what it took to earn my brass. 
 I was one of only two women in the entire department. 
 It was tough, and there was nobody helping me out, that's for sure. 
 Send my best to your dad, will you? 
 Of course. 
 All right. 
 So here's how this is gonna go. 
 As the Battalion Chief, I oversee a dozen different stations. 
 I don't have time to babysit either one of you, so one of you is gonna be in charge of Station    every time your team works a shift. 
 And you'll switch off. 
 Both of you are eligible to apply for the permanent captain position, 
 but that takes months. 
 There's written exams, interviews with your peers, interviews with me and the SFD board, and you will be evaluated every step of the way, and that evaluation starts today with Herrera. 
 You're first. 
 Coming? 
 Okay, everybody, let's get started! 
 Bring it in. 
 Hey! 
 Listen up. 
 Okay. So, today, I want us to work on some basics. 
 Air-consumption drills... let's pair off. 
 With new partners. 
 Hughes, you take Warren. 
 All right. Uh, this should be fun, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 You know what to do? 
 Run up, drop a line, hit the catwalk, pull the other line up, head down, pull a giant tire across the barn... without running out of air. 
 Don't be bringing my time down, especially not with the Battalion Chief out there watching. 
 Go! 
 Go, guys, go!

 How do you regulate your air so well?

 I don't know. 
 Being awesome? 
 Well, I'll be dropping back in around here, of course, see how things are progressing. 
 Absolutely, great. 
 When do you think you'll be back? 
 Could be anytime. So much more fun to surprise you. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 I'm here. I'm sorry. 
 Uh, I know it sounds like an excuse, but the dog actually did eat my alarm clock. 
 Tiffany's new place isn't big on pets, and I couldn't leave the little guy stranded. 
 Puppy-dog eyes are a real thing. 
 If you can't show up on time, you don't get to participate on active calls. 
 You're working reception today.

 Hi! Hello. 
 I'm Principal Linsley. 
 I'm sorry you had to come out. 
 I'm sure it's a false alarm. 
 It happens like clockwork this time of year. 
 Griffin Schuffman, I know you're not defacing school property! 
 Let me show you the entrance you'll want to use. 
 I'm sure whoever pulled the alarm is covered in blue dye by now. 
 We installed that gel that sprays when the alarm gets pulled. 
 Thought that would be a deterrent. 
 Grant Crossley! 
 If you know better, do better. 
 Put the plant back inside the pot, please. 
 [RADIO CHATTER] 
 So, you can shut it off and get the kids back inside their classrooms quickly? 
 Yes. Of course. 
 As acting captain, I can assure you we'll do everything possible to wrap this up for you and your students. 
 I just did the thing... didn't I? 
 Where I assumed that he was in charge because he's so tall and... tall. 
 A-And I have to go now and stop that group of  th graders from vaping. 
 Excuse me. 
 Those are still cigarettes! 
 All right, let's sweep.

 Bishop and Gibson, exterior.

 If it's a false alarm, you're released. 
 And I'll check in with...

 Now, Ava, I know you don't feel comfortable talking to your parents, but maybe there's a teacher or... or the principal. 
 - That's the problem. 
 Her mom is the principal. 
 AVA: I haven't told her yet. 
 She pays attention to pretty much every other kid but me. 
 The only thing she'd notice is if I brought home bad grades. 
 Which Ava doesn't, ever. 
 So, you two, you're, uh... 
 you're good friends? 
 Yeah, from debate, since last year.

 It keeps going off, no matter how many times I change the batteries. 
 So, you taught it a lesson. 
 My sometimes-boyfriend was over. 
 He hit it with his baseball bat.

 Okay, y'all are keeping me up, but I'm tired.

 Big deal! So I'm a grinder. I...

 SHAWN'S MOM:  You didn't give me an answer about dinner on Sunday. 
 You should bring your new boyfriend.

 Okay, Dean, can I get a little leverage? 
 I think we're gonna extract him on this side. 
 All right, on my way.

 You and I could. 
 He can't.

 Let's figure out what we have that we can use.

 They have no turnout jackets, they have no protection. 
 She's aware. 
 Cover your mouth. 
 Okay. That's, uh... saline, instant ice pack... 
 Blue fire's not regular fire. 
 It's sticky, so if it touches us, we can't stamp it out. 
 Pretty soon, with the heat it's radiating... 
 It'll be too hot for us to breathe without burning our lungs. 
 We'll be burning ourselves from the inside out. 
 The most important thing is protect your airway. 
 We've got an oxygen tank. 
 Put him on this. 
 That'll protect him.

 Hang on! We have to think big picture.

 Even if it worked, it would take too long.
