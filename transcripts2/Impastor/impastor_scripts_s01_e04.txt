 Buddy voice-over : Along with Barlow's identity, I took his life savings and put it all in a rock solid investment: the Steelers minus 3 1/2. 
 Pastor Barlow? 
 I'm Charlotte Nelson. 
 Thank you for coming to Aunt Ruby's wake. 
 Happy to be here... on this most solemn occasion. 
 I took the liberty of writing up a few facts about Aunt Ruby that you can use at the eulogy on Wednesday. 
 "Amateur yodeler... avid quilter... liked eggs... 
 Impressive life. 
 I'll be sure and use these. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Buddy voice-over : Two seconds to go. 
 Come on, baby. Field goal wins it... 
 No. No. Jesus, no! 
 Why did she have to die so young? 
 Ruby was 88. 
 88? [scoffs] 
 That's like the new... 
 78. 
 Pastor Barlow, I don't think you've met my lovely wife, Hilva. 
 How ya doing? 
 Hilva's family has owned this mortuary for three generations. 
 We've buried most of Ladner. 
 [chuckles] 
 Well, hopefully they were dead first. 
 Of course. 
 We require a coroner's certificate before we'll even begin planning the internment. 
 I was just making a joke. 
 Oh. 
 I'm not a fan of humor. 
 Excuse me. 
 I must go provide warmth and comfort to the grief-stricken. 
 She's quite a catch. 
 Thank you. It's interesting. 
 We were high school sweethearts and have been together ever since, except for a brief time when she was off at Embalming School. 
 But... 
 How romantic. 
 Alden. 
 Buddy voice-over : The dumbass Steelers had blown every penny Barlow had. 
 Plus the extra 5 grand I'd bet on credit. 
 I needed some cash. 
 And fast. 
 Hilva : Thank you for coming, everyone. 
 The visitation is over now. 
 Buddy voice-over : What I was considering was pretty low, I had to look deep into my soul and ask myself one question... 
 Is anyone watching?

 Okay, I want the silk shift paired with the box clutch. 
 I said clutch. That is a purse, Gladys. 
 How are the models doing? 
 Oof, it's Spanx on Spanx over there. 
 When do I get to see the dress? 
 Just came in. 
 [Russell gasps] 
 Courtesy gasp or real gasp? 
 Real. 
 When you strut the runway in that dress, the whole world is gonna know Alexa Cummings is the fashion queen of the tri-county area. 
 I know! It's gonna be such a big night for me. 
 And for the sick kids. 
 Yeah, them too. 
 Dora : Hey, guys. Listen. 
 I know you're super busy, but I just wanted to help out, despite the fact that I was not reelected to the fundraising committee. 
 Dora, we all know you were the scapegoat for the tainted cookie dough drive. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 I take full blame. 
 Although Kim Brooks did leave them overnight in the trunk of her car. 
 Anyhoo, have I ever told you about my online store, a-Dora-ble Creations? 
 both : "Lifestyle designs for the modern woman, handmade by Dora herself." 
 I guess I have. 
 Anyway, I made some accessories that I thought the models could wear in the show tonight. 
 I call them "Owl-Rings." 
 [chuckles] 
 Aren't they a hoot? 
 And a holler. 
 Yeah, it's just... 
 I'm afraid to give the models any last-minute changes, especially with some of them going through the change. 
 Denise is a sweaty powder keg. 
 You understand. 
 Yeah, of course. I mean, I was just trying to help out. 
 But, hey, it's your show. 
 Thanks. 
 It's always your show. 
 Buddy voice-over : Being new to town, I had no way to fence stolen merch. 
 So I called the only person I knew who might: Ashlee, my hooker. 
 So you want to go somewhere or is this a car jacking? 
 Buddy : Hold on. 
 I just want to talk. 
 One of those. 
 Price is the same. 
 Do you know anyone who might be interested in a beautiful, superexpensive ruby necklace, no questions asked? 
 Yeah, I know a guy. 
 Yeah? 
 I'm the guy. 
 I get a lot of "superexpensive" gifts. 
 I like to know who's screwing me. 
 So to speak. 
 How much is it worth? 
 15, maybe 20. 
 Thousand? 
 Dollars. 
 This is just colored glass. 
 sh1t! 
 So you want to do something or what? 
 Time is money. 
 What can I get for 20 bucks? 
 Blue balls. 
 Buddy voice-over : I couldn't believe Aunt Ruby screwed me like that. 
 Now, where the hell was I gonna get 5 grand to pay back my bookie? 
 Buddy, don't forget tonight is Alexa's fashion show put on by Alexa at Boutique Alexa in the United States of Alexa. 
 Is something wrong between you and Alexa? 
 You know me so well. 
 You know, just because I'm not some sophisticated, big city fashionista, it does not mean that I don't have good taste. 
 Or feelings. 
 What's this? 
 Oh, that's, uh... 
 That's a gift. 
 Ooh. It's so fancy. 
 Who's it for? 
 It's, uh... 
 For you. 
 For me? 
 But... why? 
 For being the most... awesome church administrator I've ever had. 
 Buddy, you're so sweet. 
 Just when life knocks me down, you pick me right back up. 
 [chuckles] 
 Are these rubies? 
 Yeah. 
 But they're yours now. 
 [gasps] 
 Oh, oh, oh! 
 Oh, my god. 
 I'm terribly sorry. 
 Look what I've done. 
 It's just water. 
 I've had a lot worse things spilled on me. 
 Oh. Well, here. Here. 
 Please. 
 Oh, just when I thought there were no more gentlemen in the world.

 Charlotte : Pastor Barlow, this is difficult for me to say. 
 I understand. 
 Death's a bummer. 
 Just let it out, my suffering lamb. 
 Your assistant Dora stole my Aunt Ruby's necklace. 
 I'm going to the police. 
 Charlotte. 
 I think you're mistaken. 
 Dora's the most honest person I know. 
 Pastor, I know what I saw. 
 She was wearing Aunt Ruby's necklace. 
 It's a one of-a-kind priceless heirloom. 
 I'll give you "heirloom." 
 Excuse me? 
 Look. 
 There's no reason to go to the police. Trust me. 
 I was the last one to leave the funeral home, and I promise, the necklace was still on Aunt Ruby when I left. 
 It's not that I don't believe you, Reverend, but I would like to see that for myself. 
 And you will. 
 Tell you what. 
 Tomorrow morning, before we stick Ruby in the ground, how about we pop the casket and give you a look-see? 
 Well, that would give me peace of mind. 
 Buddy voice-over : And give me a chance to stay out of prison. 
 Hey, world's most awesome church administrator, whatcha doin'? 
 Oh, I'm just crocheting some ponchos for my online store. 
 Hey, do you want to try one on? 
 They're unisex. 
 My least favorite kind of s*x. 
 [chuckles] 
 So I see you're wearing my little gift. 
 Oh, I haven't taken it off since you gave it to me. 
 Yeah, you know, I've been thinking. 
 I just went out and got that without even asking if you like old lady necklaces. 
 So if you want me to exchange it for something cooler... 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Seven years I worked for Reverend Willis, and the only thing he gave me was pink eye. 
 Now, I know it's kind of soon to say this, but you, sir... 
 Best. 
 Boss. 
 Ever. 
 Guilty as charged.

 I'm in a rush. 
 Can I get the coffee maker for the fundraiser? 
 Yes, just please figure-eight the cord when you're done. 
 Unlike last time. 
 Did you make these? 
 They are beautiful. 
 I mean a-Dora-ble. 
 [gasps] 
 Thank you. 
 I mean, I used a cross-stitch and a double crochet, and then I... 
 They'd be perfect for the fashion show. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 You never like any... 
 Um... 
 Great. How many do you want? 
 I'll take them all. 
 Oh, well, just let me check my pending orders. 
 Yep, you are in luck.

 Hey hey, no need to send anybody. 
 You'll get your money by Friday. Don't worry. 
 Buddy voice-over : I had bought some time with Rico, but I was running out of time to get that necklace back from Dora. 
 I had one last card to play: the gay card. 
 Bye. 
 I'm off to get a manicure, and then I'm going to the fashion show. 
 Hey. Uh... 
 Is that what you're wearing? 
 Yes, why? 
 Well, it's just... Never mind. 
 Oh, no, no. [chuckles] 
 I mean... What? 
 Well, something about that outfit that isn't working. 
 Spin. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, I hate to say this; it's the necklace. 
 Yeah, it's too much. 
 It clashes with all the a-Dora-bleness. 
 Really? 
 I mean, that's what I think. 
 But what do my people know about fashion? 
 Well, you know what? 
 I'm gonna wear it anyway, 'cause I... I just love it. 
 I just would hate for anything to pull focus from your big night. 
 Thank you, Buddy. 
 But it's not my night. 
 It's a night to give to the sick and the suffering. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Okay, Ashlee, show time. 
 Now, remember, I'll do the talking. 
 Just sit there and don't say a word.

 Never in a wheelchair on a public street, but...

 Hi, Dora. Oh, I'd like you to meet Stephanie. 
 I met her while I was volunteering at a hospice place.

 Hi, Stephanie. 
 It's nice to meet you. 
 She's not deaf. She's got cancer. 
 The bad kind. 
 We're talking weeks, not months. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 I'll put you on my prayer list.

 Oh, she likes your necklace. 
 Yeah, it's very pretty, isn't it? 
 Oh, you... You want it? 
 Oh, Stephanie, it doesn't belong to you, sweetheart. 
 It's Dora's. 
 Pick something else for your dying wish. 
 Oh, no. 
 I mean, if she really wants it... 
 Oh, no, we'll get her some ice cream or something. 
 No, no, no. I want you to have it. 
 I mean, if it's okay with you. 
 Who am I to stand in the way of such a beautiful gesture? 
 Here we go.
