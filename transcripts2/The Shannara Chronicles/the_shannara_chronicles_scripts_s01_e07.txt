 Previously on The Shannara Chronicles... 
 The Changeling is an ancient Demon, that can inhabit the form of any being it chooses. 
 Long live the king. 
 The truth has been lying to us. 
 This sword is a talisman of evil. 
 It is you who are the danger. 
 The Druid is no more. 
 Pykon's no fairy tale. 
 My parents died in the dungeons of that stinking Elvin Fortress. 
 I'd really like to get the hell out of here. 
 (roaring) 
 Run! 
 Hold on! 
 (shouting) 
 The hell with that! 
 (startled gasping) 
 The stones... 
 (wincing) 
 Amberle? 
 Eretria? 
 Eretria?! 
 (crows cawing) 
 Hello? 
 Aah! Hey! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? 
 Who are you? 
 (grunting, fighting) 
 Come on, man. You're hurtin' yourself. 
 (grunting) 
 Unh! 
 Hey! Wait, wait, please! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa... wait! Please. 
 You're one of them, aren't you? 
 Who? One of who? 
 The Elf hunters. They took my ear! 
 Oh, no, it's okay. Look, I'm half-Elf. 
 (stone clatters) 
 Attacking isn't an option. 
 The terrain is too hostile, the army's too big... 
 We'd be crushed before we even reached the battlefield. 
 Arion : What about the Federation? 
 Even  if  they agreed to fight by our side and sent every available soldier in the Four Lands, I still don't like our chances. 
 What if it were not an attack, but an assassination? 
 We have the blade, and with the Druid out of the way we have the advantage of surprise. 
 A lot has happened in your absence, brother. 
 The Druid was in league with the Dagda Mor. 
 How is that possible? 
 Oh, that means Amberle's... 
 We have to assume that she's been misled. 
 Tell me, if a force was small enough, could it reach the Henge undetected? 
 Even if we got there, it's surrounded by magic. 
 Dark magic. 
 The type that the Warlock Blade was forged to combat. 
 The Dagda Mor would be powerless against it. 
 You need to sneak in and kill him. 
 You can't be serious. 
 It's our only chance. 
 At what, dying? 
 We can't send our soldiers to slaughter like that. 
 Father, I should be the one to go. 
 I will bring you back his head. 
 Let me wield the blade for you. 
 No. 
 You're next in line, you're needed here. 
 I'll go. 
 You are both my sons. 
 There are no two men on the planet that I could be more certain of would bring home a victory. 
 You shall both go. 
 Wha... 
 But, Father, you... 
 The decision is made. 
 Two sons, one blade... 
 One purpose. 
 (Eventine laughing) 
 The Demon won't even know you're coming. 
 ♪ I feel it running through my veins ♪ 
♪ And I need that fire ♪ 
♪ Just to know that I'm awake ♪♪ 
 (panting, coughing) 
 Wil! 
 Eretria! 
 Woman : Where did he go? 
 Man : I don't know. 
 He slipped out of my hands. 
 Woman : I need the other ear. 
 You lost him. 
 Elves just don't fall out of the sky every day. 
 Find that elf! 
 Man : I'll find him. 
 (gasping) Shhh! 
 (whispering) They've done something to Wil. 
 We need to... 
 Those aren't just any humans. 
 They're Elf hunters. 
 (pained gasping) 
 You look worried. 
 It is not weakness to disobey your father's orders. 
 They are the king's orders. 
 I know. 
 But rushing in alone to kill the Dagda Mor is suicide. 
 So is waiting. 
 This is a chance to prove myself worthy. 
 I know that you're upset with him, but you cannot make him give you the crown. 
 Now is the time to stand united. 
 Together, behind the walls of Arborlon. 
 I can't. 
 This will stop the bleeding. 
 Wow. It feels good. 
 Mmm, real good. (giggling) 
 This particular combo is also good for recreational use. 
 Tell me more about these hunters. 
 Uh, they're human. Hate Elves. 
 They hunt us down and harvest our ears. 
 Harvest them? 
 Harvest them for what? 
 Gnomes. 
 They think Elf ears have some sort of medical properties. 
 By this time next week, my left ear will be ground up in some horny gnome's tea. 
 I was travelling with two friends. 
 I'm worried that these hunters might have snatched them. 
 Either of your friends an Elf? 
 Then you should be worried. 
 Eretria. 
 Eretria, we have to go back. 
 You're not safe back there. 
 And so we just leave Wil? 
 Of course not. 
 We find cover, and then we go back and look for him once night falls. 
 (twigs snapping) 
 Run! 
 Amberle! 
 Come on! 
 We lost them. 
 We need to get back to camp and round everyone up. 
 Now! 
 This isn't just any Elf we're hunting. 
 This one is royal. 
 That was close. 
 Yeah, no kidding. 
 You know, sometimes I feel like there's someone out there watching over us. 
 Don't know if you call it magic or fate... 
 (snapping) 
 (grunting) 
 (coughing) 
 (coughing continues) 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 Where are we? 
 I don't know. 
 Wait, I've heard of places like this. 
 Buildings from the age of man, buried during the great war. 
 You can't seriously believe that. 
 It would have rotted away by now. 
 They were sealed and preserved. 
 Like a butterfly caught in amber. 
 It's almost like they were gonna have a party. 
 Place is creepy if you ask me. 
 (flittering, screeching) 
 Whatever this place is, we need to get out of here, and fast, before those Elf hunters find us. 
 That's our way out. 
 (horse whinnying) 
 Man : We'll find out when she returns. 
 (indistinct chattering) 
 When they cut off my ear, the pain... 
 When they went for the other one, my partner, Genewen, fought back, and I escaped. 
 I think they have her in there. 
 Maybe your friends, too. 
 What were you two doing out here? 
 We were on a scouting mission. 
 We come from Olden Moor. 
 Never heard of it. 
 Some of the Elven settlements were coming under attack by demons, so we started scouting missions to warn the outlying villages. 
 It's him. The one who took my ear. 
 Wait here. 
 Gather! 
 We spotted an Elf and a human, travelling north below the ridge trail. 
 This Elf... is a royal. 
 (amazed murmuring) 
 Her ears will keep us in furs and drink for many winters to come. 
 The first who hands me her head will be paid double. 
 (laughing, chattering) 
 They had no idea their world was about to end. 
 They look happy. 
 They look dead to me. 
 You can drop the whole tough girl act, you know. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 You were across that line at Pykon. 
 You could have easily left us there, but you didn't. 
 You came back, you saved my life. 
 Don't overthink it, Princess. 
 You die, I don't get paid. 
 I don't believe that. 
 I don't care. 
 Fine, I do care. 
 Why don't we braid each other's hair, have a party, talk about the boys we like? 
 Sound good to you? 
 Hilarious. 
 Now, why don't you put that stupid book down and help me find a way out of this tomb? 
 Anything I can say to stop you from going on this suicide mission? 
 I could think of a few that might delay me for a few hours. 
 I'm serious. I have a bad feeling. 
 What choice do I have? 
 The Druid is gone, Amberle is out of reach. 
 People are losing hope. 
 Thanks to you, we know exactly where our enemy is. 
 And for the first time since this war began, we have a weapon strong enough to defeat their magic. 
 Okay, you're right. 
 The people need you. 
 Yes, they do. 
 Got any last words of advice for me, Commander? 
 Don't die. 
 That is an excellent plan. 
 (shallow gasping) 
 (screaming) 
 Bremen? 
 Yes, my apprentice. 
 I have walked these lands for over 300 years. 
 I am tired. 
 Tired of people refusing to believe the truth. 
 I am ready to leave, Master. 
 I am ready to join you on the other side. 
 It is not your time. 
 There's work yet to be done. 
 What more can I do... alone? 
 You are not alone. 
 Another has emerged. 
 Powerful, full of promise. 
 And without you, they cannot fight what is coming. 
 You must be strong. 
 The world is at a tipping point. 
 Without you, all will be lost. 
 Bremen... 
 We need to find a door out of here. 
 I think this is it. 
 We're never gonna get out of here. 
 You're hurt. 
 It's just a scratch. 
 You need to get warm. 
 I need to take a look at that. 
 So you do care? 
 About you slowing us down? Yes. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 
 
 
 Zora : Hunters, move out. 
 Cormac, guard the camp. 
 I'm going after my friends. 
 I have to follow. 
 As soon as I find them, we'll come and help you get Genewen back. 
 You have my word. 
 Will you wait? 
 I'll wait, but only because I owe you my life. 
 That's my ear. 
 Hey, Perk! You said you'd wait. 
 That's... my... ear! 
 Little one. 
 You came back. 
 You owe me another ear. 
 Aah! 
 (screaming) 
 Sure you want to do that? 
 It happened when I hit the water. 
 I floated downstream, and it slammed into this jagged rock. 
 Thought I was going to drown. 
 Do you think he made it? 
 Of course he did. 
 Do you know how many times I've tried to get rid of that guy? 
 He'll probably sail in here and save the day any minute. 
 Exactly. 
 And he was in your vision. 
 I'm guessing your old tree has no reason to lie. 
 What'd you see in there anyway? You never told me. 
 I saw you and Wil. 
 Standing in front of this incredible stained glass window. 
 It was right after I... 
 Right after what? 
 Right after I killed Wil. 
 The tree said I had to do it to prove I was ready for what's ahead. 
 I'm sorry you had to do that. 
 Not as sorry as I am. 
 The things we've seen since this all started. 
 All the innocent blood that's been spilled. 
 You know, and what's the point? 
 Now that I know what my grandfather did in the name of our kind? 
 Maybe you were right about the Elves. 
 Maybe we don't deserve saving. 
 Yeah, maybe none of us do. 
 Perhaps it would be better for the Demons to do their bidding. 
 Wash the slate clean. 
 Well, it didn't work out too well the last time. 
 I know how it feels to be trapped by your own life. 
 I didn't exactly choose to be a Rover. 
 You said you were bought? 
 So the story goes. 
 According to Cephalo, he vastly underpaid. 
 Guess my first owners were pretty eager to unload me. 
 And who knows about my parents. 
 That's awful. 
 A child shouldn't be left to walk through life alone. 
 On the bright side, we've finally found something that we have in common. 
 We're orphans. 
 Well, it's a reach, but I'll take it. 
 Who would've thought? 
 The Princess and the Rover. 
 Bound by a tragic fate and... 
 Hot for the same guy? 
 (chuckling) 
 One hell of a mess, aren't we? 
 (crash) 
 Zora : They're here. 
 Find them. 
 Nobody gets out. 
 Now, about my friends. 
 Tell me where you last saw them. 
 Why bother? 
 They're probably dead already. 
 Zora... She's the best Elf Hunter this side of the Drey Wood. 
 It's all you. 
 Wait! Wait! Okay, okay. 
 Okay. 
 Head east, past the treeline. 
 Follow the game trail. 
 That's where they disappeared. 
 I swear, I swear, that's all that I know. 
 Thanks, you did the right thing. 
 Go ahead. 
 What? 
 You didn't think we were going to just let you go, did you? 
 Wait... 
 It's okay, tough guy. 
 Torture's not really my thing. 
 (chuckling) 
 Taking out a serial Elf killer, on the other hand, is a top priority. 
 You didn't have to do that. 
 Kill or be killed, that's the only way. 
 No, it's not. It makes you just as bad as he is. 
 He got what he deserved, and I'm not sorry. 
 Give me a hand. 
 Hey, girl, you okay? 
 (screeching) 
 That is Genewen? 
 (screeching) 
 Split up. 
 We'll cover more ground. 
 We need to get those ropes. 
 Please don't hurt me. 
 Thanks. 
 (grunting) 
 Let's get out of here. 
 There's a small ravine that runs to the west of the breakline. 
 Lets out just beyond the Dagda Mor's Henge. 
 It's our best chance of slipping past the Demon army and getting to him. 
 Let's hope that blade protects us. 
 I'm willing to bet they're not expecting two idiot princes to fly in there solo. 
 We've got that to our advantage. 
 There's no way we're going to make it out of there alive, right? 
 That's the burden of princes. 
 Come on. 
 What? 
 She's still here. 
 We have to go. 
 That's the window from my vision. 
 Ending up here was no accident. 
 This is how we find the Bloodfire. 
 Are you sure? 
 Positive. 
 Long time no see, Eretria. 
 I always knew we'd meet again. 
 Happy to see you too, Zora. 
 You two know each other? 
 We grew up together. 
 When was the last time we saw each other? 
 Oh... that's right. 
 When you left me. 
 Well, that's an exaggeration. 
 We had a thing, but you got a little clingy. 
 Do you know what it was like for me? 
 Alone? 
 In the wilderness? 
 So you started collecting Elf ears for a living? 
 Sit. 
 I'm impressed with how you took out my hunters. 
 Not bad for a pampered princess and her... what are you anyway? 
 Her pet? 
 You're an embarrassment to the human race. 
 Well, coming from you, I'll take it as a compliment. 
 I don't know what's going on between the two of you, but you need to let us go. 
 Is that right? 
 Don't bother. 
 The Four Lands is in danger. 
 You must have heard about the Demon attacks. 
 I'm not interested in your stories, Princess. 
 Just your ears. 
 Something's wrong. 
 There should be thousands upon thousands of Demons. 
 I saw them here with my own eyes. 
 You're sure this is the right place? 
 Yes. 
 There. 
 That's the Dagda Mor's Henge. 
 Totally unguarded. 
 Perhaps the Demons have already been dispatched and are marching on Arborlon. 
 Or Amberle. 
 Now is the time to strike, is it not? 
 You with me, brother? 
 I'm ready. 
 Afraid there's only room for two on this ride. 
 Maybe in the next life? 
 Shame you have to die. 
 (screeching) 
 Wil! 
 You're alive! 
 What is that? 
 (screeching) 
 She's called a Roc. 
 I saved her and her partner, Perk. 
 He's a Wing Rider. 
 (Zora moaning) 
 Let's go! 
 Wil : Hold on. 
 Eretria! 
 We have to go back! 
 Aah! 
 Bandon? 
 (roaring) 
 I've been expecting you. 
 Keep your distance. 
 We don't know what he's capable of. 
 Foolish prince. 
 I tell you to fetch me my sword, and you do it. 
 I command you to kill the Druid, and you run him through. 
 They were the King's commands. 
 Your father is dead. 
 Father... 
 And you are my puppet. 
 Ander, no! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 I tricked you into delivering me this sword. 
 Now you will test its blade. 
 No! 
 No! 
 (chanting) 
 (screaming) 
 It's taking too long. 
 He'll be back. 
 You just got to be patient. 
 What you got there? 
 Oh, it's just something I found inside. 
 What are they? 
 It's just some sort of game, or... 
 I don't know, it's silly. 
 No, tell me. 
 They reminded me of you. 
 Perk : Hey! 
 Any sign? 
 They packed her up and headed out quickly. 
 I think they're using the trees for cover. 
 I've done half a dozen passes, and still nothing. 
 We need to go on foot. 
 Thank you, Perk. 
 No, thank you. 
 If you ever need me, use this whistle. 
 She's out there alone. 
 We'll find her. 
 I promise. 
 Arion charged the Dagda Mor head on. 
 The truest act of bravery I have ever seen. 
 And you escaped the Henge unharmed? 
 All because of my brother. 
 He saved me, Father. 
 He gave up his life, but I couldn't help him. 
 I'm sure you did everything you could. 
 No, I didn't. 
 But I'm gonna try and do my best now. 
 Ander... 
 Arion, my father... 
 All gone. And now...? 
 And now you are king.
