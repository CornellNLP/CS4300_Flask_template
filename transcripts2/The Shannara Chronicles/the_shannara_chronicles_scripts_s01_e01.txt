 Amberle, you still alive? 
 Relax, Uncle Ander. 
 It's not like I'm gonna break. 
 How many times have I missed that jump tonight? 
 Five. 
 You lose count of your steps tomorrow, it'll be the shortest half mile of your life. 
 I'm going again. 
 No. 
 It's late. 
 The race starts at dawn... you need to rest. 
 But only the first seven runners across the line become members of the Chosen. 
 I didn't do all of this just to lose.

 Princess, are you sure you wanna step on thousands of years of Elvin tradition? 
 There's no turning back. 
 We need to get in there and stake out my starting place. 
 Don't worry. 
 As your friend and loyal servant, I've got you covered. 
 Okay, let's stay focused, Catania. 
 Bet you wish you'd told Lorin you were running now. 
 He's a big boy, he can handle it. 
 Jace told me that if Lorin becomes a member of the Chosen, he's gonna ask you to marry him. 
 Amberle. 
 You're not allowed here. 
 Have you come to wish me luck? 
 Yes... and no. 
 I'm racing too. 
 You're kidding? 
 Is there a rule that says a girl can't run the Gauntlet? 
 That's the way it's always been. 
 We have female commanders in the Elvin army, and women on the High Council. 
 It's time the Four Lands had a female Chosen. 
 You knew about this? 
 Who do you think sneaked her past the Home Guard and out of the palace? 
 The Gauntlet is dangerous, Amberle. 
 These guys will do anything to win. 
 So will I. 
 Then good luck. 
 May the best elf win. 
 I'm definitely sensing a lot of sweaty elf boy hate. 
 Are you sure you want to do this? 
 Tie me up.

 At the dawn of every new year, we gather in this sacred garden to recount the story of the Ellcrys. 
 Thousands of years ago... our Elven ancestors fought a war against an army of Demons. 
 The Elves were at the point of annihilation, when their elders turned to magic. 
 Using this powerful gift, they managed to imprison the Demons in a realm known as the Forbidding. 
 The Ellcrys was created to stand sentry. 
 As long as it lives, the Demons are locked up for all eternity. 
 Now, I realize that for some of you, this is merely... folklore. 
 But in no way does this diminish your responsibilities. 
 And you are now its protectors. 
 Now step forward, place your hands on the tree, and be accepted by the Ellcrys. 
 I can't believe you let her embarrass our father like that. s hi last ceremony before he abdicates the throne. 
 I didn't let Amberle do anything. 
 Okay, this was her idea. 
 I just aided and abetted. 
 She could have seriously hurt herself. 
 I thought for Aine's sake that you'd want to keep her safe. 
 Invoking our dead brother, that's very subtle. 
 You should work that into your coronation speech. 
 We made a pact to protect her, remember? 
 Well, at least you'll know where she'll be for the next year... locked behind these walls, watering an old tree. 
 Do you have any respect for Elvin traditions? 
 Only the ones with parties.

 Had to go all the way to Olney, but I found white willow bark. 
 Afraid it won't do any good now. 
 I'll leave you two alone.

 Hey, Mom. 
 You hang in there, I've got something new to try. 
 I promise, this will ease your pain. 
 Always... such a... a sweet boy. 
 So much... I need... to tell you. 
 Open it. 
 They're Elfstones. 
 Belonged... to your father. 
 They're magic. 
 I know you thought... (wheezing) your father was crazy... but he was... a good man. 
 He believed in those. 
 Mom, you're not making any sense. 
 My precious... boy... (wheezing) find... the Druid. 
 Find... the Druid. 
 Promise me.

 No, Mom, don't leave me. 
 No, Mom, I'm not ready.

 (birds chirping) 
 She always loved this spot. 
 Said she could see the whole world from here. 
 I'm sorry, Wil. 
 Hey, um, Uncle Flick... have you ever seen these before? 
 Mom called 'em Elfstones. 
 I told her to bury those damn things after your father died. 
 Why? 
 Because they put him in an early grave. 
 He was never the same person after he used 'em. 
 Used 'em? 
 Wait, you're not seriously telling me you believe in magic. 
 I believe in evil, Wil, and those things will bring you nothing but misery. 
 Do yourself a favor, throw them in the river and be done with 'em. 
 I'm sorry.

 Someone's here to see you. 
 I told the Home Guard not to let anyone in. 
 That's why Catania helped me avoid them. 
 Catania : If you won't tell me what's going on, maybe you'll talk to him. 
 You owe me. 
 You didn't need to check up on me. 
 You passed out in front of the Ellcrys. 
 I was worried about you. 
 I'm fine. 
 Then why have you locked yourself up in here? 
 You wouldn't believe me if I told you. 
 Is that one me? 
 Oh, oh... 
 You definitely got the ears right. 
 Come on. Hey. 
 Can I ask you something crazy but you have to promise not to laugh? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you think the story of the Ellcrys is true? 
 You mean the part where it's a barrier holding back a Demon army? 
 Come on, Amberle, we both know magic died out with the Druids. 
 Yeah, you're right. 
 Forget I asked. 
 Come to the celebration tonight. 
 People need to see you. 
 I need to see you. 
 Leave your demons behind and come and celebrate.

 Flick : You just buried your ma. 
 Now is not the time to be making reckless decisions about your future. 
 I know my future's not here. 
 That's the Elfstones talking. 
 Give me a little credit, Uncle Flick. 
 I threw those things away like you said. 
 I'm moving to Storlock to train as a healer. 
 You've never been more than five miles outside of Shady Vale. 
 The world outside is dangerous, Wil. 
 It's full of Gnomes and Trolls and Rovers. 
 They all hate each other. 
 The only thing they have in common is they hate Elves more. 
 (horse whinnying) 
 I'll keep my ears covered... just like always. 
 You're the same as your father. 
 Never happy with your place in the world. 
 What is that suppose to mean? 
 Stay in Shady Vale. 
 Let me talk to Dax. 
 I'm sure he could use an apprentice. 
 Dax couldn't heal a stubbed toe. 
 Storlock has the best healers in the Four Lands.

 It wasn't enough.

 Uncle Ander. 
 Thanks for the save. 
 The Gauntlet's easier to navigate than this party. 
 Just don't faint again and you'll be fine. 
 My fainting days are over. 
 Good, because as you can see, there are a lot of people who are very eager to meet you. 
 Grandpa still hasn't spoken to me. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 You know, sometimes I think the only member of the family that he actually likes is Manx. 
 Speaking of loyal dogs, how's your boyfriend? 
 Be nice. 
 Lorin's a good guy. 
 He deserves someone who truly loves him. 
 I'm just not sure that someone is me. 
 Well, then you'd better tell him or else you're going to spend a very awkward year together in the Sanctuary. 
 Not nearly as awkward as watching you pine for Commander Tilton. 
 No... 
 No, I'm not pining, I'm... 
 I'm observing. 
 That's been over for a very long time. 
 And I think we can both agree she made the wiser choice.

 Amberle, you're not making any sense. 
 When I touch the tree, it shows me visions... horrible visions of the future. 
 Like what? 
 That I'm going to kill you, Lorin. 
 Kill me? 
 I saw it. 
 I stabbed you. 
 I don't know what to think anymore. 
 I should never have run the Gauntlet.

 Prince Ander, any word on Amberle? 
 The Black Watch are still sweeping the countryside. 
 I wish there was something I could do. 
 You can start by telling the truth. 
 I told Prince Arion everything. 
 See, I'm an excellent liar, which means I can tell when somebody's lying to me. 
 Amberle left the party upset and you followed her out here. 
 You two got into a fight... and now she's missing. 
 As far as I'm concerned, I'm staring at the prime suspect. 
 She said the Ellcrys called to her and showed her a vision of the future. 
 In it... she killed me.

 You need to mobilize the Elven army. 
 Why does a dying tree require an army? 
 You do know the story of the Ellcrys, don't you? 
 Each leaf represents a single Demon. 
 Once they begin to fall, the creatures of darkness will be released from the Forbidding, one by one. 
 We all know that story is just a fairy tale. 
 Father, you're not actually listening to this, are you? 
 You've allowed him to believe this when you know the opposite to be true. 
 After the War of the Races, I believed that magic had disappeared, along with you and the Warlock Lord. 
 Well, then you tell that to your people when the fairy tales are ripping out their throats!
