  [BABY FUSSES] 
  [BABY CRYING] 
  [GRUNTING] 
  [BABY CRYING] 
  Okay, I know, I know. 
  I know come here, come here. 
  [SMOOCHING] 
  Hi, hi, hi, hi. 
  You're okay. 
  - Hey, you're okay. 
  You're okay. 
  - [BABY CRYING] 
  [SHUSHING] 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  [COUGHS] 
  [MACHINE WHIRRING] 
  Look, the air quality's terrible. 
  My guess is allergies. 
  When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras, okay? 
  Our treatment's been working, your tumor's been responding. 
  Let's not panic just yet. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  [TRUCK ENGINE WHIRS OUTSIDE] 
  [TRUCK BEEPING] 
  Felt like the city was screaming in my face all night. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Well, that means you definitely should stay right here in bed. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - Is everything all right? 
  I'm just tired. 
  Give me a few minutes, and I'll be right. 
  [MONITOR BEEPING] 
  [DOOR OPENS, INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PA] 
  Hey, you. 
  Ah, so this is where the party's at. 
  Uh, yeah, I do feel good. 
  Thanks to the 12-straight hours of morphine Dr. 
  Handler has been pumping into your system. 
  Okay, whatever. 
  I mean, like I even need morphine. 
  With my tolerance, I'm not even high right now. 
  Well, I must say, for a woman that just went through major reconstructive leg surgery, you look absolutely ravishing. 
  Really? 
  No. 
  And if you believe that, then you're most assuredly high. 
  [LIGHT MUSIC] 
  Party's over. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Martha Randle, collapsed in her cell at Rikers. 
  She's G3P4 with a history of fibroids producing heavy menstrual flow. 
  Hypotensive, tachycardic, and febrile. 
  Also complaining of numbness in her leg. 
  Can you please tell me where is the numbness? 
  Up and down my right leg. 
  Okay. 
  Can you please lift your leg for me? 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Wait. 
  What's wrong with me? 
  I can't move my leg. 
  I can't move my leg. 
  Dr. Proctor, this is Martha. 
  Martha, I'm an OB/GYN. 
  We're going to get you sorted out, okay? 
  I need to order blood and urine cultures. 
  I think you'll find Staph aureus. 
  Toxic shock? 
  Martha, have you been using tampons for longer than recommended? 
  I used my last one for nine Nine hours shouldn't cause this much damage. 
  She means nine days. 
  Alert me the moment the MRI is ready. 
  Nine days? 
  How did you know? 
  Martha is not my first patient from Rikers with toxic shock. 
  How many more before someone dies? 
  - Where are we going? 
  - To find Max. 
  Mm. 
  Max, I didn't think you were gonna make it. 
  Well, it's a very busy day, then I heard you were running my best doctor out of town, so I made some time. 
  Honestly, Max, I can handle it. 
  Yeah, I know you can, but you shouldn't have to because you did nothing wrong. 
  She was arrested in a heroin den. 
  Safe injection sites aren't flop houses. 
  They're the future. 
  And for helping her patient, who most doctors would have let die in the street, you want to reprimand the most accomplished, most selfless, not to mention coolest doctor in this hospital? 
  She broke the law. 
  She got caught. 
  You'll have our disciplinary action by end of day. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
  Imagine if you hadn't have turned up. 
  That might've gone poorly. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Why didn't you tell me? 
  I didn't hear any of this until I I didn't want to burden you. 
  Burden me. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Please, always. 
  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, DOOR OPENS] 
  Max we need to talk about Rikers. 
  Martha Randle is in Rikers for marijuana possession, and now she may not live to see the end of her sentence. 
  It's not just tampons. 
  I've had a dozen patients tell me that pap smears and mammograms are being withheld as punishment, and now they have cancer. 
  So much of this is preventable. 
  One routine visit at Rikers, and most of my inmate patients wouldn't even be here. 
  Hey, guys, I got the 911. 
  What's going on? 
  - Uh, Rikers. 
  - Rikers again? 
  Man, that place is a mental-health catastrophe. 
  My patients go in for a month, they come out with a lifetime of trauma. 
  Hey, anybody else thinking what I'm thinking? 
  That basic preventative care would cut the rate of illness in half there? 
  That's not what he's thinking. 
  No? 
  How many more guesses do I get? 
  Casey, grab me ten exam table rolls, ten boxes of paper patient gowns, and all the female hygiene products you can fit in the van. 
  - The van? 
  - Yeah, also get a van. 
  Oh, that's what he was thinking. 
  Wait, you're not serious, are you? 
  Whatever you're in jail for doesn't mean you deserve to die because you couldn't get a checkup. 
  These women are our patients. 
  They need our help, and we're gonna give it to them, so we are going to Rikers. 
  You can't hide, you can't hide [BELL RINGING, INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PA] 
  You can't hide because you don't know how God's got your number He knows where you live Death's got a warrant for you You can't hide, you can't hide [DOOR BUZZES] 
  You can't hide because you don't know how God's got your number And He knows where you live Death's got a warrant for you You may run to the rock To hide your face The rock cried out, ain't no hiding place God's got your number, and He knows where you live Death's got a warrant for you You may run around Till you lose your soul Heaven won't be your home [DOOR BUZZES, OPENS] 
  Sir, New Amsterdam doctors are here. 
  Warden Hughes, I'm Dr. 
  Goodwin. 
  Thanks for having us. 
  We're very excited to get our clinic under way. 
  The mayor said that you could show us around? 
  - Did he? 
  - Let's go, ladies! 
  Well, this is the dining hall. 
  Upstairs is the rec room. 
  Through there are the cell blocks, and that concludes our tour. 
  Thanks for your hospitality. 
  Look, I tried to stop this fiasco every step of the way, but seeing as the mayor answers your calls and not mine, follow me. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Play nice. 
  Warden, I get that you don't appreciate me going over your head to the mayor, but our goal is not to embarrass you or to get in your way. 
  You're 0 for 2 there, Doc. 
  We just want to provide basic checkups. 
  A one-day clinic to treat your female inmate population. 
  - For everyone? 
  - That's right. 
  All 600 of the women incarcerated here. 
  With zero prep time and no additional COs hell of a plan. 
  I imagine Martha Randle would say that any plan is better than what you have now, or she wouldn't be in our hospital. 
  If you'd like to donate a box of tampons, we'll take them. 
  Beyond that, if inmate Randle felt sick, she should've gone to Sick Call. 
  She did, and they said that she didn't seem sick. 
  This was a full day before she collapsed from a massive stroke caused by poison, so I can see how she'd seem fine. 
  [BELL RINGS, DOOR OPENS] 
  What happened to playing nice? 
  I said you play nice. 
  Oh, good cop, bad cop. 
  I love it. 
  Very appropriate. 
  Liars, liars! 
  You're all liars! 
  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
  Oh, that's right! 
  Oh, that's right! 
  - I'm crazy, huh? 
  - That's enough! 
  - Get off of me! 
  - This is the examination room. 
  [SHOUTING CONTINUES] 
  Your attention. 
  The New Amsterdam doctors are here to tell you how to do your job. 
  [DOOR BUZZES] 
  Sorry, this is it? 
  Um where do you provide pap smears or procedures that require undressing? 
  Right here. 
  What about mental health? 
  You you do that here? 
  Everything, right here. 
  But no one is going to ask for care without privacy. 
  This is what's causing your problem. 
  Our problem is a health-care budget of about $5 per inmate per day. 
  We had a heroin overdose this morning, and that's half of today's cash gone it's not even lunchtime yet. 
  We're doing the best we can with what we have. 
  Now, I'm a results guy. 
  If you can improve things, I'll be the first to say thanks. 
  And if you can't, I'll be the first to tell the Mayor all about it. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  [SIREN WAILING] 
  Suspected heroin OD from Rikers. 
  Severe pulmonary distress. 
  - Did you push Narcan? 
  - Two amps, no response. 
  She might be having pulmonary edema. 
  Renal function? 
  Creatinine is 1. 8 and rising. 
  What's that mean? 
  Push 60 mg IV Lasix. 
  Set up an intubation tray and a stat cardiac echo. 
  - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  - It means she's in trouble. 
  [GROANING] 
  [GRUNTS] 
  Just breathe. 
  [GROANS] 
  I want a pill. 
  I bet you do. 
  No, I am serious, Zach. 
  You asked me to monitor your hydrocodone a job I happen to take seriously. 
  So here's the deal. 
  Over the next 24 hours, you're allowed four pills, so this has to last you six hours. 
  What I recommend is that you wait you take this in one hour. 
  Can I take, like, half now and then half later? 
  If you want to sacrifice pain management in the name of a quick and dirty fix, go nuts. 
  But for maximum pain relief, wait one hour. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  Fine. 
  Brilliant. 
  See you in 60. 
  Lucky me. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PA] 
  [SIGHS] 
  Martha, count backwards from five, please. 
  Five four, three Very good. 
  I'm going to ask some questions and your answers will let me observe your brain function. 
  Do you have children? 
  Yes. 
  Very good. 
  Now, if you could share a memory. 
  Any happy one will do. 
  My son's fourth birthday we went to this play center. 
  Ball pits, arcades Man, he loved it. 
  There was this this room full of trampolines, wall to wall. 
  And Darrell charged in like a lunatic, doing flips, making faces. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  And his smile was just Do they visit? 
  Some people at Rikers, if they know you got kids and they want something from you It's better that they don't come. 
  Did you find what you needed? 
  Martha, it appears you have a marantic embolism. 
  The bacteria from our vaginal infection has traveled to your brain. 
  We need to remove the clot surgically. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER] 
  Um, hi. 
  A moment of your attention, everybody. 
  Everybody, listen up. 
  Uh, yeah, hi, guys. 
  My name is Dr. 
  Frome, I'm from New Amsterdam. 
  And I noticed that your exam room here is a little on the small side, so I'm setting up shop in the consult room to discuss really anything that's on your minds. 
  - Free of charge. 
  - Yo, we got this old Humpty Dumpty-looking fool up in here. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  Yo, Dopey, where the rest of the seven dwarves at? 
  - That's good. 
  - Show some respect, inmate. 
  That's okay, I can handle it. 
  I've been to middle school. 
  Ooh, Doc got jokes. 
  What'd I say, Pearl? 
  Keep talking, it's a write-up. 
  [BELL RINGS, DOOR OPENS] 
  May I? 
  Hi. 
  - It's Pearl, right? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Is it always like that between you two, or you just putting on a little show for me? 
  That's how CO Sanchez is. 
  Want to know why there ain't no trees on Rikers? 
  I don't know, do I? 
  Sanchez needed 'em all for the big stick up Wait, you writing me up? 
  I said you keep talking, it's a write-up. 
  You just kept talking. 
  Oh, no, no, I asked her a question. 
  - She was answering my question. 
  - Take her out of here. 
  Rec privileges revoked. 
  Hold on, hold on, I asked her a question. 
  You a punk, Sucia Sanchez. 
  No wonder you're free of charge. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  If this is real, I swear to God They set up in the cafeteria. 
  [GRUMBLES] 
  Nurse Kamoe, can we get these two to the urgent-care table? 
  Right this way. 
  Not a word. 
  Shut it down. 
  This is over. 
  Warden, you said that if I can improve things, you'd be the first to admit it. 
  - Well, this is an improvement. 
  - Improvement? 
  You're in flagrant violation of regulations. 
  The exam room isn't small for the hell of it. 
  The COs need a clear line of vision on the inmates at all times. 
  Yeah, and they've got one. 
  The patients get privacy, and the COs can still see. 
  You were given enough COs to secure a hallway, not an open area. 
  There are 50 people in this line. 
  The regulations regarding COs-to-inmate ratios are clear. 
  - Shut it down. 
  - Can we rotate more COs in? 
  With written permission from their union. 
  Should take about a month. 
  Yo. 
  You here for back pain? 
  Form a line in A Block hallway. 
  Come on. 
  Let's go A Block. 
  Did I stutter? 
  Let's do this. 
  Word's got out y'all got new mattresses. 
  Most folks here crying back pain are just angling for dibs. 
  Lambona. 
  Ignore her scheming ass. 
  A Block's got their own Cos, so that should ratio y'all's ratios, right? 
  Game on. 
  Thank you. 
  Max Goodwin. 
  Jackie Connor. 
  Farther Almost there. 
  [MONITOR BEEPING] 
  Mm. 
  A little farther Looking good. 
  And the clot is out. 
  Will you please inform Ms. 
  Randle's family? 
  Can't do that. 
  They should know Martha's procedure was successful. 
  No can do. 
  It's a security risk to let them know she's out of Rikers at all. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PA] 
  She almost died. 
  You don't want her children to know? 
  Her husband? 
  To offer comfort? 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Pearl, you got a visitor. 
  Seriously, dude? 
  You trying to get me thrown in the SHU? 
  No, no, I came to apologize. 
  I did not mean to cause any trouble for you. 
  It's not your fault. 
  Sanchez is always up my ass for no reason. 
  Last week she gave me a shot for excessive eye-rolling. 
  Wow. 
  You know, power structures, they can they can get muddy. 
  Save it, Doc. Sucia Sanchez is just mean, always has been. 
  You mean since you've been here? 
  Since Mrs. Brenneman's second grade class! 
  Oh. 
  Yeah, we were friends. 
  Sucia Sanchez and Burly Pearly. 
  Yeah, so what happened? 
  She got her ass arrested and put in my jail. 
  Doc, I know half the women in here. 
  - I treat them all the same. 
  - Yeah, except you don't. 
  That write-up you gave Pearl felt pretty personal. 
  I'm a female CO. 
  The men watch. 
  They see you go soft for one second, that's your career. 
  - Right. 
  - So, yeah it's a tight leash on Pearl. 
  That's Rikers, bro. 
  That bridge outside you leave your friendships at the other end. 
  [DOOR BUZZES] 
  [WINCES] 
  [SIGHS] 
  Okay [INHALES SHARPLY] 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  [SIGHS, INHALES SHARPLY] 
  Oh, come on [FRANTIC MUSIC] 
  [SIGHS] 
  Oh, yes. 
  Oh, God, okay. 
  [PANTS] 
  [GROANING] 
  [YELPS] 
  And table three is now open. 
  Don't make me repeat myself. 
  Natasha, get on up there. 
  Yeah, Lindsay, it's cool, just take your time. 
  It's not like there are, you know, sick people here or anything. 
  When you get out of here, just call me for a job. 
  Do I look like I have time to chitchat? 
  Just move the trash. 
  [CLEARING THROAT] 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO] 
  You okay? 
  Uh, yeah, just, um, swallowed funny. 
  You didn't look like you swallowed funny. 
  I keep telling my face to do the swallowed-funny expression better. 
  You keep asking me to burden you, but that goes both ways. 
  Hey, you have a second? 
  Sure, what's up? 
  It's not for me, it's my girlfriend. 
  She's got some intense symptoms going on. 
  Big mood swings out of nowhere, putting on some weight. 
  But she's too embarrassed to ask for help. 
  - Could you - Of course, where is she? 
  Solitary. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Well, you're gonna have to hand over those bags. 
  You can't bring those in here. 
  Well, we need tools to treat her. 
  Right, and I need the dangerous inmate not to get her hands on things she can kill you with. 
  - The bags? 
  - Makes sense. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  [BANGS ON DOOR] 
  Charly, you got company. 
  Charly, these folks are here to see you. 
  It's okay. 
  Hi, uh, I'm Max Goodwin, and this is Helen Sharpe. 
  We're doctors, and we're here to help you. 
  Your girlfriend, Dezi, said that you were experiencing some problems, uh, so she asked us to come by. 
  How are you feeling? 
  Um can you can you describe your symptoms? 
  Uh, are you pulling your hair out, or is it coming out on its own? 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  You mind if I take a look? 
  Is that okay? 
  Just Your specific pattern of hair loss may be Don't touch me. 
  - Watch it, Charly. 
  - We're okay. 
  Sorry. 
  Back up. 
  You back the hell up. 
  Coming in here laughing at me? 
  You laughing at me? 
  Huh? 
  Answer me. 
  Nobody is laughing at you. 
  Oh you don't laugh at me. 
  I laugh at you. 
  Okay. 
  [LAUGHING MENACINGLY] 
  Charly, Dezi said You don't say her name! 
  [GRUNTING] 
  Get out! 
  Get out! 
  [SCREAMING] 
  - Are you okay? 
  - Yep. 
  Get the hell out of here! 
  Come on, let's go. 
  You know, holding down that call button won't get me here any faster. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I-I need another pill. 
  What happened to the one that you had? 
  It's gone. 
  I have looked everywhere for it. 
  Gone? 
  Look, someone must've come in here and cleaned while I was asleep Dr. 
  Bloom, we can't just give you another pill. 
  - Says who? 
  - Says you, remember? 
  "No matter what I say, don't give me anything - more than what's prescribed. "  
  - That was different. 
  That was to stop me from abusing the medication. 
  Just test my blood. 
  You'll see that I'm clean. 
  We can't. 
  The morphine from this morning is still in your system. 
  Oh, my God, all I'm asking for is that you replace one, tiny little pill. 
  - Is that too much to ask? 
  - I will page Dr. 
  Ligon, okay? 
  No, Eddie, you know what? 
  I'm sorry, I'm just I'm just in so so much pain. 
  [CRYING] 
  [DOOR BUZZES] 
  So why not thyroid disease? 
  That would explain the hair. 
  Charly was the opposite of restless, - and she wasn't sweating. 
  - Keep it moving, please. 
  Then ringworm or a fungal infection. 
  Makes sense with the hair, but you're ignoring what we saw when she just stood up she was wobbling. 
  If the muscular weakness started around the same time as the behavioral changes, then it could be heart disease. 
  You're thinking about the distention in her neck veins. 
  Yeah, or even rheumatoid arthritis. 
  - Time to go. 
  - Uh, just not done. 
  Let me save you some time. 
  She's nuts. 
  Hair loss, venous distention, weight gain she's got so many symptoms that any doctor would want her under observation yesterday, but to simply dismiss them because of her psychological issues is They're not psychological. 
  Hey! 
  So I would like to start by saying thank you both for being here. 
  I'm just here 'cause Warden said I had to. 
  I'm just here 'cause the door is locked. 
  I know, I know. 
  Just when you thought nothing could get worse than jail, along comes couples therapy, right? 
  I'll make this quick. 
  There are issues from your past that are impacting your ability to get along in the present, right? 
  So I would like to help you navigate those issues. 
  Issue is she needs to obey me. 
  Our past ain't got nothing to do with it. 
  So why did you stop being friends? 
  She drifted into a bad way of life. 
  Girl, I'm in here on a misdemeanor. 
  You talking like I'm Pablo Escobar. 
  Okay, Pablo, then why don't you tell me why do you think you two fell out? 
  I don't know. 
  She wouldn't tell me, even though I asked. 
  You hooked up with that loser Justin Karn and never wanted to do anything ever again. 
  Don't lie. 
  So why did you being with Justin mean that you couldn't spend your time with Sanchez? 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  You know how it is. 
  If I spent time with my friends without him, he'd hit me or whatever. 
  I didn't know that. 
  So, when you get an infraction in here, does that feel similar? 
  - Like I'm right back there. 
  - Right. 
  So what, then, that's on me? 
  No, nobody's saying that. 
  Good, 'cause I didn't put you in jail. 
  I'm just doing my job. 
  Right, and like you told me, if you don't do your job, the guys see it. 
  Damn right. 
  Right, so you both have been controlled by men. 
  Look, I need this job. 
 
 
 
  I got kids. 
  You got kids? 
  Hector and Ruby. 
  Ruby like your tÃ­a. 
  You remember her? 
  Look, I can't be talking about this with you, chica. 
  I'm a CO, you're an inmate. 
  That's all we can be. 
  That's true. 
  You you can't be friends while you're in here, but you can look at each other just for a second and remember that there's more to who you are. 
  - I told y'all to go. 
  - [MAX CLEARS THROAT] 
  - Charly, just look at me. 
  - Dr. 
  Goodwin. 
  I'm good, I'm good. 
  Dr. 
  Sharpe, can you stand in the doorway and hold up your hand, please? 
  Take five steps back, little man. 
  Just look at me. 
  Focus on my eyes and don't turn your head. 
  Just stay with me. 
  I don't want to look in your dumb-ass eyes. 
  Why would I look at you? 
  Because you can't see the walls. 
  Right? 
  How many fingers is she holding up? 
  Without looking can you tell me? 
  You're having peripheral-vision problems. 
  They probably started around the same time as your hair loss and your leg weakness maybe neck pain, too. 
  We think you have a brain tumor and it's pressing on your optic nerve, and that is what is causing all of this. 
  That's why you feel the way you do. 
  It's why your emotions have been so intense, the behavior that got you in the SHU it's not your fault. 
  So I-I'm not - I'm not - You're not crazy. 
  You're sick. 
  And we're gonna get you to New Amsterdam, and you're gonna get better. 
  Okay? 
  Okay. 
  You stay strong. 
  Your surgery was a success. 
  So I get to go back to Rikers. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PA] 
  In order to confirm that Ms. 
  Randle's embolism is fully cleared, I need to perform a radionuclide scan. 
  It emits a great deal of radiation. 
  And? 
  I suggest you stay out here, unless you prefer not to have children. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  [WHISPERING] 
  Got to be quiet. 
  - Darrell! 
  - Shh. 
  [WHISPERING] 
  Mom, The doctor said we have to be quiet. 
  Okay. 
  Come here, babies. 
  Oh, look at you. 
  You got so big. 
  Are you okay? 
  Look at you. 
  I forgot how nice it is to have you so close that I can stop by just to steal a kiss. 
  Can't steal what I want to give. 
  Come here, you. 
  Mwah. 
  Hey, about this morning, I know I need to give you some space. 
  Don't even. 
  We're all good. 
  I'm just really excited that you're home. 
  So, sorry for misplacing my chill. 
  San Francisco Memorial offered me a full-time position - Hmm. 
  - As Head Legal Counsel. 
  I didn't know how to tell you. 
  And I'm so sorry to drop this on you in the middle of the day, but I-I love you Well, what did you tell them? 
  I said I'd consider it. 
  - Get off of me!

  I need two ambulances four inmates, multiple lacerations. 
  Get 'em to New Amsterdam. 
  How's she doing? 
  To be honest, Dr. 
  Ligon, not great. 
  She's exhibiting drug-seeking behavior. 
  She was just trying to lie to me about losing a pill. 
  I mean, I knew that Bloom had a bit of a reputation, but this was - She was screaming at me. 
  - You mean Dr. 
  Bloom? 
  Yes, I-I didn't mean any offense. 
  Dr. Bloom is one of the finest doctors I've ever worked with, and I trust that you're not one to put stock into petty rumors. 
  No, of course not If Dr. 
  Bloom said that the pill got lost, then the pill got lost, understand? 
  Yes, Doctor. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Hey, how you feeling? 
  Thank you for what you said. 
  Oh, you heard that. 
  I looked everywhere for it. 
  I mean, I seriously thought that I was going crazy. 
  I mean, at one point I thought that I must've taken it and then forgotten that I'd taken it. 
  But I know in my heart I didn't do it. 
  And you believe me? 
  Well, let's not write a sonnet about it, shall we? 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  [SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTANCE] 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Why do you believe me? 
  Why? 
  You've got no reason to. 
  I don't follow. 
  As one addict to another The only way that you could be Certain that I didn't take it Is if you did. 
  Addicts do two things. 
  Get high and blame other people for their mistakes. 
  You're doing the latter or is this both at once? 
  Yes? 
  Ella, I want to offer you support I learned from the blogs I found. 
  You read blogs? 
  About how to be a helpful grandparent. 
  Have you heard of "meal trains"? 
  Perhaps I can conduct one. 
  Uh, Vijay What is it? 
  I have obsessive compulsive disorder. 
  I understand. 
  It is not uncommon for pregnancy to cause OCD. 
  Right, uh but this is not from the pregnancy. 
  Okay, so when was it diagnosed? 
  About 12 years ago uh, after I was hospitalized. 
  [SMACKS LIPS] 
  Uh, they put me on high doses of Zoloft and Trazodone, but now I'm pregnant, so no more meds. 
  I've been talking with Dr. 
  Frome, 'cause I don't [CHUCKLES] 
  I don't know if I can do this. 
  You will make a wonderful mother. 
  But in order to be a wonderful mom, I have to put this kid first. 
  And so I made a plan to make sure that I can manage my OCD. 
  And I'm gonna move back in with my parents. 
  That sounds very wise. 
  In Idaho.

  That's great news. 
  Yeah, all four of them are. 
  How'd you leave it with the warden? 
  [SIGHS] 
  This was not his favorite day at the office, but he surprised me. 
  Yeah, in that he didn't stab you as well? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  In that he has asked us to go back. 
  The warden is a results guy, and he liked our results, so I suggested that Rikers become part of our med school rotation. 
  We could send students over during OB/GYN and Behavioral Health and he's requesting extra COs to ensure their safety. 
  That's great that's great work. 
  [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  I thought you'd be more pleased. 
  No, I am, I am.
