 Karen... 
 what's the deal? 
 Did you not see me? 
 Of course I did, but I ran because your face says     
 - you want money for something. 
 - Oh, well, yeah, I do. 
 What is it today? 
 Therapy dogs for postpartum mothers? 
 Improv classes for survivors of PTSD? 
 No, good idea, both of those, but I was thinking that... 
 - I want to end systemic racism. 
 - Oh, for God's sake. 
 No, just at the hospital. 
 Start small, right? 
 Wow, that's kind of controversial stance. 
 Walking away, siding with racism. 
 Kind of a Karen move, Karen. 
 My exasperation with you has no relation to my thoughts on racism. 
 Why today, Max? 
 Knew you were gonna ask that, but there is no answer, because we should be asking the right question, which is why not yesterday? 
 Why not a year ago? 
 Why not two years ago when I first took over? 
 Systemic racism should have been the first thing I addressed when I got to New Amsterdam, and I'm appalled that it wasn't,    
 - so today it is. 
 - And you need money for... 
 A new position, someone to help us identify and eliminate systemic marginalization while correcting inequities throughout the whole hospital. 
 You want a chief equity officer? 
 Yeah, that's perfect. 
 We'll call it that. 
 Oh, and I am not going anywhere until you give me one. 
 Well, in that case, go away, because we already have one. 
 We do?

 Well, according to the latest report by Health and Human Services, Latinx women are   % more likely to have cervical cancer and   % more likely to die from it than white women. 
 Indigenous Americans have twice the HIV infection rate as that of non-Hispanic whites. 
 Black women are two to six times more likely to die from complications of pregnancy than white women. 
 Actually, it's    times more likely in New York City. 
 Your statistics are a bit... generic.

 - Three years. 
 Three... three years?

 But as women of color, you are both vastly under... hi.

 Seems judgmental for a doctor. 
 I agree. 
 And I should have had more faith in your progress, in you, honestly. 
 Ollie is bad, but I would never lose the game      
 - just to hurt him... 
 - Yeah, I believe you. 
 So I told Luisa how to do it. 
 You did what? 
 I told Luisa how to get him alone where no one would see, and I told her to use the door because it was the best way for someone her size... 
 No, no, Juliet, no, you can't do that. 
 You can't teach kids to hurt other kids. 
 I taught her how to defend herself. 
 - That is not your job. 
 - But she's my friend. 
 [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
 ♪ 
 Do you really consider Luisa to be your friend? 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 New rule to the game. 
 You can't help anyone hurt someone else. 
 If you do, you lose. 
 - Starting now? 
 - Yeah, starting now. 
 So I'm still winning, right? 
 Right. 
 You're still winning.

 Heard about your listening tour. 
 I was on the subway this morning, and there was this toddler who's a cute little Black boy around Luna's age, and he was just exploring, you know, running around, and this random guy starts yelling at this kid's mom. 
 "Control your damn kid." And... that guy would deny it. 
 But when Luna runs around like that, nobody yells at her. 
 I mean, it's the opposite, you know? 
 People smile and do funny little voices, and... 
 ♪ 
 Luna gets to grow up seeing the world as safe, friendly, and that kid... 
 gets screamed at... 
 and his mom gets to be on high alert every second of every day knowing there's always another guy who's ready to yell at her kid or make him feel small or one day... 
 Or one day kill him. 
 Do you know what I said to that racist on the train? 
 Nothing. 
 Because I didn't even realize it until I got off the train. 
 ♪ 
 Look, I'm not gonna ask you to fix everything. 
 I just want you to know that I'm grateful... 
 That you're here. 
 It's been hard... 
 But it's been easier... 
 knowing that you are here. 
 I'm here to inform you that I'm stepping down as Deputy Medical Director. 
 I'm sorry that it's poor timing. 
 The job has meant so much to me. 
 But I have to focus on other things right now. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you for listening. 
 But your patient's size is limiting. 
 I'll try again in    minutes. 
 I'm sorry about Superman, Lauren. 
 Nothing about today feels like it makes sense. 
 Maybe it does.

 I met with Max today to step down as Deputy Medical Director. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Why is that? 
 'Cause Mina's coming to New York     
 - to live with me. 
 - Mm. 
 - So you changed your mind? 
 - I did. 
 Having Mina here with me, getting to know my family,      
 - that's what feels right. 
 - Mm. 
 Well, then I'm very excited. 
 Um, but if I'm gonna do this, then I have to put my whole self into it. 
 Everything I have has to go to her. 
 Of course. 
 I'll help in any way I can. 
 No, you won't.

 Has to go to her.

 So what are you gonna do about this? 
 I have absolutely no idea. 
 No idea what to put up that won't offend someone or exclude someone else or seem too hollow or... 
 or too charged. 
 I... 
 For the first time since I got here... 
 I have absolutely no idea what to do for the people in this hospital. 
 Good. 
 Good? 
 Uh, why is that good? 
 You're not supposed to do things for people. 
 That's not sustainable, Max. 
 But if you do things with people, you can start a movement. 
 What do you need? 
 Say the word, and it's yours. 
 A new office. 
 How is that gonna end systemic racism at New Amsterdam? 
 Because my new office is going to be right next to yours.
