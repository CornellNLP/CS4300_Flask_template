 Hi, there. 
  It's me, Ryan Eggold. 
   I play Dr. 
  Max Goodwin on "New Amsterdam."  We are very proud to bring you our season two finale. 
   It's a good one. 
   But first, I want to take a moment  to thank all the healthcare professionals  who right now are working their buns off  to keep everyone safe. 
   You guys are our inspiration for every story  we tell every episode we make,  and now you are everyone's inspiration,  so thank you, and keep up the heroic work  that you are doing. 
   We all dearly appreciate it. 
   It's because of that admiration and a sense of caution  that we decided not to air tonight's  originally scheduled episode,  which was titled "Pandemic."  It hit a little too close to home,  and we didn't want to make entertainment  out of a story that's a little too scary,  a little too real at the moment. 
   But we're gonna show you that episode later  once some time has passed. 
   But the good news is  that we're gonna show you a little teaser  from that episode  because it introduces  one of our newest characters  played by the incomparable  Mr. 
  Daniel Dae Kim,  who I would like to hand it to right now. 
   Thanks, Ryan. 
   And aloha, everybody. 
   Ryan is absolutely right. 
   The storyline you're about to see  introduces my character, Dr. 
  Cassian Shin. 
   Now what we've done is pulled together  all of Cassian's scenes  to give you a sense of his character  and how he's gonna change more than a few things  around the hospital. 
   As you guys may know, this storyline  turned out to be very personal to me  because I ended up contracted COVID-19,  the disease caused by coronavirus,  while I was in New York shooting this very episode. 
   Now, thankfully, I was fortunate enough  to have experienced a full recovery. 
   But too many others have not. 
   So on behalf of the entire casting crew,  we'd like to dedicate this season finale  to those still fighting the illness. 
   We're rooting for you. 
   How can I help? 
   We're down two trauma surgeons. 
   I had to call in our new hire a week early. 
   You sure that they're ready for this? 
   No. 
   That's why I need you to help him through it. 
   - Dr. 
  Shim? 
  - Hang on. 
   [WATCH BEEPS] 
   Yes. 
   Hi, I'm Dr. 
  Helen Sharpe, Deputy Medical Director. 
   We really appreciate you starting early. 
   Yeah, Max said almost half your staff was down. 
   And our patient load has almost tripled. 
   - Any recent traumas? 
  - Thankfully, no. 
   But I need to get you to the ED straightaway. 
   Which way is the men's locker room? 
   Uh, it's back that way. 
   There's a bathroom just along here. 
   - I need a hot shower. 
  - And we do need you in ED. 
   Yeah, but I need that shower more. 
   [PAGER BEEPING] 
   The hospital's in the middle of a crisis. 
   I know... 
  the dispenser was out of body wash. 
   This is your new pager. 
   As you can see, it's being paged,  so maybe it's time to wrap up this beauty routine  and join me in the ED. 
   How about I put on some pants first? 
   This is Casey, our head nurse. 
   Casey, this is Dr. 
  Shin, our new trauma surgeon. 
   Oh, thank God. 
  Follow me. 
   I got a kid who appears to have swallowed  some rare earth magnets. 
   Ah, that's a surefire way to get attention, huh? 
   [CHUCKLES] 
  Hi, I'm Dr. 
  Shin. 
   Casey, do you know the risks  when adjusting multiple magnets? 
   Uh, if the magnets were to connect internally,  they could twist the intestines,  force hemorrhages,  intussusception. 
   - Even a strangulated bowel. 
  - They can also do this. 
   Cool, right? 
   But you only swallowed one magnet, didn't you? 
   Mm. 
   So that should pass in a few hours. 
   Turns out you don't need me. 
   Uh, in case you haven't noticed,  we have a full ED of patients who need your help. 
   Where do you think you're going? 
   I always show up when I'm paged,  but I only stay when I'm needed.

   Dr. 
  Gilmore to Pediatrics. 
   Should I go for the energy drink  or the protein bar? 
   Why would you need energy? 
   You seem intent on doing virtually nothing. 
   So you vote protein bar. 
   I know that trauma surgeons  like to play the aloof cowboy, but that's not... 
   That's not how you do things here. 
   - No, yes, it's not. 
  - I know. 
   Don't you think I researched this place  before I took the job? 
   Then you should also know Max's motto. 
   "How can I help?" Yeah, that's catchy. 
   It's words that we live by. 
  Everybody chips in. 
   - Everybody helps. 
  - Right now I am helping.

   Well, maybe.

   Lucas Jarvis. 
  Nail gun mishap. 
   It slipped. 
   Well, Mr. 
  Jarvis, you're very lucky. 
   This is lucky? 
   Well, the fact that your new nail appendage  missed the bone in every one of your fingers is. 
   You know what? 
   Don't you dare. 
   - I'm thinking Dr... 
  - Turan. 
   Dr. 
  Turan here gets to practice  her nail extraction skills. 
   Now, a little numbing agent  and some gentle retrograde pressure,  and that sucker should come right out. 
   - Dr. 
  Shin... 
  - You got this? 
   Yeah. 
   - Dr.
