 Previously on "New Amsterdam. 
  " This may be one of the last things I do. 
  Max! 
  I am your doctor, Max. 
  I'm taking you off the chemo and radiation. 
  I'm gonna find you a different regimen and I'm gonna save your life. 
  Could you, um, message this to Dr. 
  Valentina Castro? 
  Max's DNA? 
  I was actually here to talk to Max - about extending my leave. 
  - For how long? 
  Like, forever. 
  You know I got you, right? 
  [BEEPING] 
  The placenta previa ruptured. 
  I was about to call 911. 
  Max, the baby won't survive another one. 
  So we have to get her out. 
  [BABY COOING] 
  Luna.

  [BABY FUSSING] 
  Your turn. 
  [GROANS] 
  It's always my turn. 
  [BABY CRYING] 
  [GROANS] 
  Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
  Come here. 
  - [CRYING] 
  - I know, I know, I know. 
  [FLAPS LIPS] 
  Yeah. 
  [FLAPS LIPS] 
  Hi. 
  Good morning, Luna. 
  How you doing? 
  How you doing? 
  [KISSES] 
  How are you feeling? 
  Oh, not myself just yet. 
  It's okay, 'cause I'm all over baby duty today. 
  Oh, she wants her mama. 
  [ALL COOING] 
  Hi. 
  Hi, Luna. 
  Baby, baby sweet baby There's something that I just got to say Baby, baby sweet baby BOTH: I didn't mean to run you away Okay, Luna. 
  Hit it. 
  Baby, baby sweet baby - Hey, Max. 
  - How can we help? 
  What's the key factor in how much pain meds - we prescribe to patients? 
  - How much pain they're in. 
  - Is this a trick question? 
  - Yes. 
  I thought it seemed too easy. 
  Well, the key factor isn't pain. 
  - It's race. 
  - Ah. 
  When white and black patients present with identical levels of pain, doctors tend to prescribe the white patients high grade opioids. 
  And what do the black patients get? 
  A lecture on how to tough it out - and a handful of Tylenol. 
  - [GRUNTS] 
  - Wow, so everybody loses. 
  - Exactly. 
  That's why I want New Amsterdam's patient bill of rights to guarantee that each patient's pain is treated equitably and responsibly. 
  Luna, if you think that's a good idea, go ahead and be super cute. 
  You're good. 
  [ARETHA FRANKLIN'S "SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE"] 
  - [BLUBBERING] 
  - [COOING] 
  Who's that little Muppet? 
  Look at me! 
  Oh, let's see if I can touch your nose with my nose! 
  - Oh! 
  - Yeah. 
  Uh, how how can I help? 
  Can you repeat it? 
  Yes. 
  Sorry, Capitan. 
  Here's the sitch. 
  All right, come with me. 
  So, I'll give you one guess what all those kids in there have in common. 
  They all just heard you do 15 verses of "Baby Shark"? 
  - Walked right into that one. 
  - Yeah. 
  No, they are all transgender and they have all been denied medical care thanks to these so-called "conscience laws" allowing hospitals to just freely discriminate. 
  Hospitals are denying them transition care? 
  No, hospitals are denying them any care whatsoever. 
  So I'm proposing that New Amsterdam starts a fund - to help shoulder the cost. 
  - A lot of art on these walls. 
  Yes, Max, art therapy is a big part of what we do here, but I'm gonna need you to focus up, okay? 
  What if we create an art show annually, auction your patients' work, and use that money to, you know, build the fund you're talking about? 
  Who's the best medical director ever? 
  Who's the best medical director ever? 
  - Your daddy! 
  - [BABY COOING] 
  - 30% of doctors are over 63. 
  - Yeah, just one second. 
  Marsha, we had a bit of grunting after a morning diaper and there is an extra bottle in there in case she has a sudden growth spurt. 
  Okay, I love you, baby. 
  [KISSES] 
  - You have a good day. 
  - See you in five minutes. 
  Probably. 
  Uh, so doctors that are old. 
  What's the, uh, problem? 
  Uh, we will soon face an epidemic when they retire. 
  Vijay, you're not trying to tell me something, are you? 
  - Are you hanging up your spurs? 
  - Certainly not. 
  - It's not about me. 
  - Oh, well, then But you are over 60, right? 
  Legally, I don't have to answer that. 
  Vijay, you look great. 
  I'm just saying that if doctors retire later than most Americans, then the problem is not that they're leaving. 
  It's that they're sticking around past their prime. 
  What? 
  No, no. 
  You're twisting my words. 
  With age comes wisdom. 
  Yeah, and declining mental acuity. 
  Look, I what we should do is create new programs for senior physicians like mentorships, you know? 
  And and lower patient loads. 
  In fact, that's a really good idea. 
  Would you look into that? 
  Senior physicians? 
  The result speak for themselves. 
  I'm rarely at a loss for words, but, uh, wow. 
  "Wow" works. 
  I want all my patients to say wow. 
  Wow is my preferred reaction. 
  And I think they will. 
  With precision-targeted therapy I mean, you are the proof. 
  Thank you, Dr. 
  Castro, for, um, saving my life. 
  Thanks isn't really enough, is it? 
  It is for me. 
  Look at this. 
  By targeting your defective DNA and not carpet bombing your entire body with chemo, your tumor is finally shrinking. 
  All three of your blood lines are in their normal range. 
  And I actually gained a pound or five but who's counting? 
  I mean, six more months like this and you'll be cured. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Sorry. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Cured? 
  Max, I know you've missed Dr. 
  Sharpe. 
  If she were here, she would say the same thing. 
  You beat the odds. 
  You won the cancer lottery. 
  [BEEPING] 
  Sorry, I gotta I gotta run. 
  But, um, thank you, Dr. 
  Castro. 
  Thank you. 
  Max. 
  Max. 
  Max. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Where where where's Georgia? 
  Fractured left femur and possible concussion. 
  Give me Bloom's vitals. 
  Alright, 110, BP 150 over 95. 
  - O2 stats at 100%. 
  - Georgia? 
  - Max. 
  - Huh? 
  Max. 
  Hey, Max. 
  - What? 
  - You need to give me Luna. 
  - No. 
  - Yes. 
  - She needs to be examined. 
  - No. 
  - Yes. 
  - No, no, no. 
  - No, no, no. 
  - It's okay, it's okay. 
  - Why? 
  Why? 
  - Just give me her. 
  It's okay. 
  I'll take her. 
  She'll be fine, I promise you. 
  - It's okay. 
  - Luna? 
  It's okay. 
  It's okay. 
  - [BABY CRYING] 
  - Max. 
  - Max. 
  - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  - Are you okay? 
  - Oh, God. 
  Thank God. 
  It's not fair. 
  - Where's Luna? 
  - She's fine. 
  They're examining her. 
  They'll bring her back in just a few. 
  - Max, your head. 
  - I'm good. 
  I want a CT on both of them. 
  Is everybody else okay? 
  [BABY CRYING] 
  [TENSE MUSIC] 
  No, where's Sharpe? 
  Where's Sharpe? 
  Where's Sharpe? 
  Max, take a look at this. 
  Another case came in. 
  Alma Pearson. 
  She's a type 1 diabetic. 
  This morning she suffered full-blown ketoacidosis. 
  - It's her third one this year. 
  - Hey, Alma. 
  I'm Dr. 
  Goodwin. 
  You wanna tell me what happened? 
  She's been rationing her insulin again. 
  This time she could have died. 
  Alma, I'm gonna help you, but you have to talk to me. 
  What's there to say? 
  When I was first diagnosed, insulin cost $21 a vial. 
  Now it's $250. 
  I'm a substitute teacher and I can't afford it. 
  I can't afford to live. 
  How can you help with that? 
  [SOMBER MUSIC] 
  Alma's the eighth diabetic to come in this week. 
  One guy was trying to make insulin on his own - in his garage. 
  - Hmm. 
  - Who supplies our insulin? 
  - Uh, Pacentia. 
  Pacentia. 
  Yeah, okay, Alma, we're we're on this. 
  Um, Kenmari, I'm gonna go ahead - and green light your plan. 
  - Uh, what's my plan? 
  Your plan to terminate our contract with Pacentia Pharmaceuticals. 
  - That's not my plan. 
  - No? 
  Maybe it was mine. 
  Okay, Max, how are we gonna buy insulin? 
  We're not gonna buy insulin anymore. 
  We're gonna make our own. 
  [PERCUSSIVE MUSIC] 
  [CELL PHONE RINGING] 
  Hey, baby. 
  Good morning, beautiful black woman. 
  OH, YEAH, 6:00 a. m. 
  with pillow creases on my face? 
  Especially with pillow creases. 
  Oy, keep talking like that, I might just have to marry you. 
  Oh, that's gonna happen. 
  But right now I just need you back from San Francisco. 
  I can't take it anymore. 
  I know. 
  I know. 
  Two more weeks and counting. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  How much time do you have? 
  Three minutes. 
  You better make the most of it. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Yes, please. 
  Thank you. 
  [KNOCKING] 
  Dr. Reynolds, we could use your help in the ED. 
  I'll be right there. 
  Are you sure that you have some time? 
  I'm I'm positive, all right? 
  We got 2 1/2 minutes. 
  - Dr. 
  Reynolds? 
  - What, Nottingham? 
  One of the interns on our rotation is always showing up late. 
  And when he is here, I can't find him. 
  - Cut him. 
  - Seriously? 
  Yeah, I don't got time for dead weight or interruptions. 
  Okay, great. 
  Oh, hi, Evie. 
  What are you guys Hey, love. 
  Just calling to check on Raffi and Saleem. 
  Are they, uh are they at least trading off with the barfing now? 
  No, they're still in perfect sync, like two violently ill figure skaters. 
  - [GROANS] 
  - Now Sameera says she's sick. 
  No, no, no, no. 
  She's faking to stay home with the boys. 
  Don't believe that hype. 
  Uh, I told her to get ready for school but the big headline is head lice on Harper. 
  Again? 
  Are you kidding me? 
  That kid's head is like a cot at Rikers. 
  [GROANS] 
  I was having trouble finding someone to take care of the boys. 
  Now with Harper, I'm gonna have to cancel my patients. 
  Ah, I'm so sorry, Martin. 
  I-I wish I could be there. 
  Yeah, just promise you'll be home by 7:00 to put everyone to bed so I can start drinking. 
  Daddy? 
  [VOMITING] 
  Sameera is not faking. 
  I-I gotta go. 
  - Oh. 
  - [DISTANT SIRENS WAILING] 
  [SIGHS] 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  [PERCUSSIVE MUSIC] 
  Hey. 
  Interesting. 
  Tweety Bird? 
  I always thought of you as a Yosemite Sam kind of guy. 
  Well, that's probably because of my outlaw vibe. 
  And I am not seeing any bathroom breaks on here. 
  The residents are all taking their board exam today so we're severely understaffed. 
  I have everyone covering three different wards. 
  - It's an impossible day. 
  - No, no, no. 
  Nothing is impossible, Gladys, as long as you get me out of here by 6:00 p. m. 
  Oh, also can you, um can you find me some shoes? 
  Shoes, yep. 
  Got it. 
  [SPEAKING MANDARIN] 
  I see the Mandarin lessons are paying off. 
  They started us with swear words to get us engaged. 
  - Typical case? 
  - Impossible. 
  I've been working with this woman for two years. 
  The worst rheumatoid arthritis I have ever seen. 
  - No - I can take a look. 
  Uh, no offense, Dr. 
  Kapoor, but she needs something innovative. 
  Something I'm not seeing. 
  You think as a senior physician I can't be innovative? 
  [PERCUSSIVE MUSIC] 
  - Hello. 
  - Ah, the hand off. 
  I was wondering when you'd give up on me. 
  - Ms. 
  Klestadt, it's not - It's okay. 
  I'm used to it. 
  So, what brilliant cure do you have? 
  I don't. 
  But I will. 
  By the end of the day. 
  Dr. Kapoor, I've been working with Ms. Klestadt for two years and this is my specialty. 
  I will help your rheumatoid arthritis today or I will retire. 
  [SPEAKING MANDARIN] 
  Uh, yeah, all this stuff can come out. 
  Gotta make way for the new lab. 
  Chairwoman Brantley, were you riding in the freezer? 
  Asphyxiation in a sub-zero box would be preferable to the earful I just received from the CEO of Pacentia Pharmaceuticals. 
  You terminated our insulin contract? 
  I did. 
  It's this funny thing where I prefer not to buy medication from extortionists. 
  I and the rest of the country share your indignation but you can't just make homebrew insulin. 
  It's not kombucha. 
  This lab used to grow thousands of cultures, process hundreds of specimens a day. 
  - It's all perfectly safe. 
  - And that's for Millions of E. 
  coli cultures, which is way less scary than it sounds. 
  What scares me are lawyers. 
  Insulin is patented. 
  And yet my body is making it right now for free. 
  The patent is on how you make it, so big pharma keeps changing how they make it every couple years so they can file more patents, thus keeping competition down and prices up. 
  We both know you can't make enough insulin for all of New York, so cut the kabuki and tell me what you really want. 
  A seat at the table. 
  A sit-down with the CEO of Pacentia to negotiate prices down. 
  A stunt like this doesn't justify dragging New Amsterdam into a billion dollar lawsuit with big pharma, the FDA, and Department of Justice. 
  Now tell these people to stop what they're doing or so help me, I will fire them all. 
  You're bluffing. 
  Try me. 
  Okay, sorry, guys. 
  Change of plans. 
  Just set that down. 
  But you know what? 
  This isn't over. 
  Sure it is. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [TENSE MUSIC] 
  Kapoor, have you seen Sharpe? 
  - No, maybe she's here. 
  - She's not in the ED. 
  - Then where is she? 
  - I'll help find her. 
  Call the morgue, have them come collect the body. 
  It's one of ours. 
  Died on impact. 
  Sorry. 
  I like your necklace. 
  I like your necklace. 
  It belonged to a friend. 
  - Sorry if I intrude - No, it's it's okay. 
  It was an accident. 
  We lost two of our own. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Three, two, one. 
  Whoo! 
  Take a breath. 
  We did it. 
  We're done! 
  I know the dark is scary, right? 
  I know, but guess what? 
  Fear is a totally healthy emotion that everyone feels. 
  - Even you? 
  - Even me. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Especially me. 
  I'm scared of so many things. 
  I got a laundry list of things I'm afraid of. 
  I got I got sharks, jellyfish, clowns. 
  In fact, whenever I'm afraid of anything, I have a little trick that I use to help me get past it. 
  You guys wanna know what it is? 
  Okay, visual aid. 
  Here we go. 
  Bridge Ignatius in full effect. 
  Okay, cool. 
  Now, what I want you to do is I want you to imagine all of your fears floating beneath me right under Bridge Ignatius here, and then I want you to imagine climbing over them. 
  Do you understand? 
  Can you see that? 
  Oh, okay. 
  Uh, yeah. 
  I said okay, I said "imagine," guys. 
  - [ALL LAUGHING] 
  - Imagine, but all right. 
  This might be a toll bridge. 
  I may have to charge you, guys. 
  All right, if this is working for everybody, I guess that's cool. 
  [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] 
  No time for personal calls. 
  No, no, no, just calling Martin and the kids. 
  Gotta check in. 
  You're already four minutes late to group therapy. 
  [GROANS] 
  I used to go bike riding with my girls. 
  I taught them, running next to them as they wobbled, catching them before they fell. 
  After the blood tests, you will be bike riding in no time. 
  Well, the girls are into rock climbing now. 
  - But still. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  I'd love to be that kind of mom again before they don't need me anymore. 
  - You will. 
  - [BEEPING] 
  - Nope. 
  - What? 
  That's not possible. 
  Check it again. 
  It's a computer, not an oven. 
  [PERCUSSIVE MUSIC] 
  But all of Ms. 
  Klestadt's symptoms could be celiac disease and not rheumatoid arthritis at all. 
  Well, her blood and my computer disagree. 
  Still wanna gamble your whole medical career on me? 
  With my experience, it's not a gamble. 
  [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  Got a five O prolene stitch? 
  [CELL PHONE RINGS] 
  Can you get that for me? 
  [CELL PHONE RINGS] 
  It's Evie. 
  Is there a loving way to ignore a call? 
  No? 
  Excuse me, Dr. 
  Reynolds? 
  Who is that? 
  Who are you? 
  Michael Duke. 
  I'm an intern. 
  What are you doing here, Michael Duke? 
  Dr. 
  Nottingham dropped me from the cardiac rotation and Oh, yeah, yeah. 
  Dr. 
  Nottingham dropped you at my suggestion. 
  [BEEPING] 
  Then I'm talking to the right man, 'cause you made a mistake, Dr. 
  Reynolds. 
  Practicing medicine is a privilege, Michael Duke. 
  It's not something you show up for when you feel like it or have people come to find you while your head's in the clouds. 
  Well, you don't know me like that. 
  I mean, you you don't know me at all. 
  'Cause if you did, you'd know that I consistently score in the top five of my class. 
  That every professor acknowledges I've got the hands for surgery. 
  And when Nottingham has to find me, every time it's with a book in my hand because it's easier to study in quiet here than in my own neighborhood. 
  And I'm not I'm not telling you all this as an excuse. 
  I'm just giving you facts. 
  Like the fact I'm the best intern up in here. 
  So good these hands will be coming for your job one day. 
  [BEEPING] 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Clamp. 
  These are some of the hundreds of prescriptions that New Amsterdam has written for insulin just this week. 
  If these same patients were in Canada, these same meds would cost about a fifth as much. 
  Sadly, hospitals are barred from importing drugs from Canada, but individuals are not. 
  So, despite all appearances, New Amsterdam is not going to Canada to buy enormous loads of insulin for the hospital. 
  We are, however, going to Canada to buy enormous loads of insulin for thousands of individuals, and we're gonna keep going back and forth until Pacentia understands that increasing their profit margin is not worth the 30 million lives they are putting at risk, one of whom is my patient, Alma Pearson. 
  Thank you. 
  Thanks. 
  They're going to arrest you. 
  Probably, but they say there's no bad publicity, right? 
  - And they would be wrong. 
  - Would they? 
  Thanks, Dr. 
  Goodwin. 
  The second those truck reach the border, you're gonna have an international incident on your hand and a slate of pharma companies ready to riot. 
  Maybe then they'll give me a seat at the table. 
  That takes favors and finesse and time, but you keep throwing tantrums like a kid with a sugar high. 
  That's because my patient, Alma Pearson, doesn't have time. 
  I want a seat at the table or I'm gonna throw - another tantrum tomorrow. 
  - Give me a week! 
  You got ten hours till that truck reaches Toronto. 
  [GROANS] 
  God. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Wheelchair to Admitting. 
  Wheelchair to Admitting. 
  I just came from the airport. 
  Sorry it's been so long. 
  Everyone's just so interested in your treatment. 
  That's the great news. 
  How are you? 
  I'm sure Dr. 
  Castro's been keeping you in the loop. 
  She has. 
  I'm thrilled. 
  Though I'm surprised to learn that we're suddenly in the insulin business. 
  I don't know if we can call it a business. 
  We're giving it away for free. 
  Max. 
  How are things at home? 
  Good, yeah. 
  Luna's amazing. 
  She's, uh, sleeping through the night now. 
  Twelve weeks, so it's great. 
  If you ever need to talk, I'm here. 
  Welcome back. 
  [TENSE MUSIC] 
  [SCREAMING] 
  Do you know your name? 
  They've already done all the questions, Vijay! 
  Just pop the damn thing back in, please! 
  [GASPING] 
  Do it! 
  [SCREAMING] 
  Ah, better. 
  Hey, where have you been? 
  We didn't know where you were. 
  I was thrown. 
  There was Page the code team. 
  We're losing her. 
  - Who? 
  - It's Bloom. 
  [TENSE MUSIC] 
  [BEEPING] 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  No, no, no, Mark. 
  This is everyone's win. 
  Without your research, I Thank you. 
  Charge nurse to Admitting. 
  - I appreciate that. 
  - Charge nurse to Admitting. 
  Okay, talk soon. 
  So many wins today. 
  But I bet you get those days a lot. 
  Few and far between, to be honest. 
  Oh, and, uh, a wheel was broken on your chair. 
  I had that fixed. 
  Hope you don't mind. 
  Not at all. 
  I, um I saw Max. 
  What you've done for him is extraordinary. 
  Isn't it? 
  One look at him and you can't deny this is the future of oncology. 
  That's why I've been out raising money - using your research. 
  - Oh. 
 
 
 
  So maybe you shouldn't have fired me. 
  Pot shot, sorry. 
  Couldn't resist. 
  I made a mistake, Valentina. 
  But now I'd like you to come back. 
  Back? 
  To New Amsterdam full-time. 
  You damaged my career when you let me go. 
  No, I don't need an apology. 
  It's just that's why I can't work for you again. 
  Okay. 
  But maybe we could find a different arrangement. 
  Such as? 
  You could make me co-chair of your department. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Valentina, even with your success rate, - the financial risk would - Half your department. 
  Or you can find someone else to administer precision target therapy. 
  Max's precision target therapy. 
  You're using Max as a bargaining chip? 
  I don't want to derail Max's progress. 
  I just can't make my work vulnerable to you again. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Done. 
  [PERCUSSIVE MUSIC] 
  Empty out the contents of your purse. 
  - Excuse me? 
  - Right here. 
  Neurologists are like detectives. 
  They just need to know where to look. 
  - A lot of stuff. 
  - Here you are. 
  Here. 
  - What is this? 
  - Lavender oil. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  For? 
  - Stress relief. 
  - Does it work? 
  - Do I look relieved of stress? 
  - Okay. 
  And, uh hmm. 
  And what is this? 
  Uh, for joint pain. 
  One of those alternative medicine things. 
  This is why none of your medications are working. 
  Come with me. 
  I love alternative medicine. 
  Believe me. 
  But a lot of these alternative remedies, especially the ones from China, they contain heavy metals. 
  And when heavy metals get absorbed in your blood stream, they can block the effect of your medication. 
  Nope, no heavy metals. 
  What? 
  [PERCUSSIVE MUSIC] 
  Okay, it's called psychotherapeutic reparenting. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Ricky, since you rolled your eyes with such finesse, I'm assuming you'd like to go first. 
  Come on, it'll be good. 
  It'll it'll give you a chance to, uh, you know, feel free to express your feelings towards your mother without fear of abandonment. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Ricky. 
  Ricky, do you have something you want to say to me? 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Yeah, you look like a dude. 
  [ALL LAUGHING] 
  Okay. 
  Okay. 
  Ignore them. 
  Just say something honest to me. 
  Open up. 
  That's what this is for. 
  Okay, "Mama. 
  " When I was a kid, I wish you looked at me, seen how messed up I was. 
  Why? 
  'Cause all the bad stuff I did, I was just trying to get you to notice me. 
  To see me, the real me. 
  I kept thinking, "Why didn't you?" Why couldn't you see me? 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Now I think you did see me. 
  You just didn't care. 
  So I stopped seeing myself. 
  [INHALES SHARPLY] 
  You turned me into a ghost, Mama. 
  [SNIFFLING] 
  [INHALES DEEPLY] 
  Crap, Dr. 
  Frome, I didn't mean to get weird, man. 
  No, you did not get weird. 
  You did not you didn't get weird. 
  I got weird. 
  You got open and honest and awesome. 
  That was the point of all this, and the only reason I'm crying is because I'm proud of you. 
  Um, should I keep going? 
  'Cause you look pretty messed up. 
  No, no, no. 
  Keep going, Ricky. 
  You're doing great. 
  [INDISTINCT P. A. ANNOUNCEMENT] 
  I'm sorry; I know I shouldn't have hijacked - your surgery like that. 
  - No, you shouldn't have. 
  I've been busting my ass for five years. 
  Just stop. 
  When I was an intern on my cardiac rotation, my attending never bothered to learn my name. 
  But if I messed up in rounds or I was late once, I would have been dropped, no questions asked. 
  All right, nobody helped me. 
  No one cared that I sometimes had to choose between books and heat. 
  I had to just figure it out. 
  I had to figure out how to be great on my own. 
  And you know what? 
  I almost left medicine because of it. 
  So I'm gonna keep my eye on you. 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  - Wait, I'm back in? 
  - No, no, no. 
  Don't think that I'm gonna be easy on you, either. 
  It's gonna be quite the opposite, all right? 
  I'm gonna push you and challenge you and expect nothing less than greatness. 
  And if you rise to the challenge, maybe, just maybe you'll be good enough to come for me. 
  Yes, sir. 
  And thank you, sir. 
  You get your seat at the table? 
  No. 
  Placentia wouldn't budge. 
  And the drugs from Canada? 
  Customs wouldn't let medication loads that size past the border. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Guess I was crazy to think we could beat them. 
  Yeah. 
  It was crazy. 
  But, while we didn't win, we didn't lose either. 
  Placentia wasn't so thrilled about the negative PR, so, if I stop embarrassing them, they've agreed to offer you some insulin. 
  How much? 
  Six vials a month. 
  - But that's - A lifetime supply. 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  Oh, my God. 
  Oh, my What about everyone else? 
  Everyone else who can't afford it Only you're my patient. 
  And doctors fight for their patients, so today I fought for you. 
  Tomorrow It's another story. 
  Max Max. 
  One day you're gonna have to start talking to me again. 
  Yeah, not today. 
  [TENSE MUSIC] 
  - Sinus rhythm. 
  - Still no pulse. 
  Her heart's not pumping any blood. 
  Her neck veins are distended. 
  - Cardiac tamponade? 
  - 18 gauge cardiac needle. 
  20cc syringe, now. 
  [MACHINES BEEPING] 
  [FLATLINING] 
  [MACHINE BEEPING] 
  [INDISTINCT P. A. ANNOUNCEMENT] 
  [APPLAUSE] 
  [TENDER MUSIC] 
  Told you I got you. 
  [WHISPERING] 
  Thank you. 
  The ED is all yours now, doctor. 
  [APPLAUSE] 
  Ah, welcome back. 
  Come on, everyone wants some. 
  Get in here, get in there. 
  [INDISTINCT P. A. ANNOUNCEMENT] 
  Got a weak and dizzy in 2, an ortho consult in 11, - and then there's - What happened to my posters? 
  Oh, yeah, Candelario didn't think they were professional. 
  I like my posters. 
  We missed you. 
  You still hurting? 
  Don't ask stupid questions. 
  - You taking anything? 
  - No, I am not taking anything. 
  Not even aspirin? 
  As long as I keep moving and stay busy, it'll keep my mind off the pain. 
  Put 'em back up. 
  Could be lupus. 
  Or perhaps you're a fast metabolizer. 
  Dr. 
  Kapoor, maybe it's time for me to go home. 
  No, no. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Usually I take more time with my patients. 
  Maybe that's why I'm off my game. 
  I didn't really expect you to help me in one day. 
  But I didn't help you at all. 
  You came up with three possible diagnoses in less than eight hours. 
  Were any of them correct? 
  Lately I've been missing India quite a lot. 
  Strangers smiling at you for no reasons, the festivals, the fragrances, all the colors. 
  If I did retire, I could go home. 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Here. 
  Ugh, I hate flossing. 
  Flossing is essential for healthy teeth and gums. 
  You sound just like my dentist. 
  I stopped seeing her because she wouldn't stop with the lectures. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  What? 
  What? 
  [LAUGHS] 
  [UPBEAT MUSIC] 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Yeah, that is definitely an abscessed molar. 
  - Hmm. 
  - Why is that good news? 
  Because this is the reason none of your medications are working. 
  The abscess in the tooth created bacteria. 
  The bacteria entered your bloodstream, which caused your RA symptoms to escalate. 
  And all those medications you took went to fight the bacteria infection, not rheumatoid arthritis. 
  Wait, wait. 
  All these years, all the doctors All the medicine? 
  It was a tooth. 
  Remove it, you will feel better. 
  - Better? 
  - Yes. 
  And you may even be able to go do rock climbing with your daughters. 
  [BRETT DENNEN'S "THERE IS SO MUCH MORE"] 
  If you retire, I'll drag you back from India myself. 
  [SURPRISED LAUGH] 
  Okay, who'd I miss? 
  Uh No one. 
  Covered everybody in here. 
  Twice. 
  And you played dentist. 
  - Guess I'll go get a coffee. 
  - That's a good idea. 
  Oh, and, uh, when you get back? 
  I'ma hit you with some dance therapy. 
  I know you can do it! 
  Doctor Bloom back in the house, hey Doctor Bloom back in the house, oh - Ah, ah, ah. 
  - Huh? 
  Oh, yes, thank you. 
  Thank you very much. 
  I don't know how you did it, but it is 6:00 on the dot. 
  Probably has something to do with these amazing slippers you got me here. 
  I owe you my marriage, Gladys. 
  And Dr. 
  Frome is officially off the clock! 
  As it is [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  [CRYING] 
  I wonder how so many could be in so much pain Do you need to talk about it? 
  Feel a thing I don't feel comfortable With the way that my clothes fit [PAINED EXHALE] 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  I can't get used to my body's limits I've got some fancy shoes To try and kick away these blues [PAINED EXHALE] 
  They cost a lot of money But they aren't worth a thing [LABORED BREATHING] 
  I want to free my feet From the broken glass and concrete [SOBBING] 
  I'm here, okay? 
  I need to get out of this city [SOBBING] 
  Lay upon the ground Stare a hole in the sky Wondering where I go when I die Hi, hi, I'm here! 
  Sorry I'm five minutes late! 
  I just, uh No excuses. 
  Please do not divorce me. 
  I'll never love again. 
  Where is everybody? 
  I'm ready to shut this place down. 
  There is no need. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  "No need. 
  " Why, did you give everybody away? 
  No judgment, just curious. 
  Raffi, Saleem, Samera, and Harper they all took care of each other, the whole day. 
  They were so cute and so exhausted. 
  They were asleep by 7:00. 
  I also got to FaceTime with a patient. 
  She was really escalating and I was able to talk her down. 
  Well, look at you. 
  Look at us. 
  We helped a lot of people today. 
  I'll drink to that. 
  Just makes me feel like maybe we could, um [SIGHS] 
  Be helping even more. 
  How? 
  I think we should adopt another child. 
  What?
