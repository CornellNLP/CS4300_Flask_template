 Hi. 
 Dr. Frome from New Amsterdam. 
 - Hi. 
 - Thank you so much for meeting me. 
 I, um--I brought you donuts. 
 I ate one already. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I actually ate two. 
 I don't know why I said one,  that's... 
 [laughs] 
 - I have to be at work soon, so I don't... 
 - Yeah. 
 No, of course. 
 Uh, I just-- I wanted you to see this. 
 It's, uh--it's a journal from the patient  I was telling you about-- Jemma? 
 Normally there'd be privacy issues but, uh,  you know, this is the one thing that Jemma kept  from foster home to foster home. 
 and, uh, one of those homes was actually... 
 your mother's. 
 Uh, C--Camilla, right? 
 That--that was her name? 
 Camilla? 
 [clears throat] 
 Well, Camilla was  the first foster parent  to really make Jemma feel safe. 
 You know, safe to grow and safe to--  to be a kid, really. 
 And, uh, after Camilla died,  Jemma wrote pages and pages about her in here. 
 You can--you can read. 
 - My mother and I were estranged... 
 when she died. 
 I didn't even know she took in foster kids. 
 - Oh. 
 - I was a tough kid to raise. 
 Stubborn, wild. 
 Left when I was 16. 
 - You know,  that sounds a lot like Jemma. 
 Tough, but she's got a big heart. 
 - I can't be her foster parent  if that's what this is about. 
 - I--I'm sorry. 
 [sighs] 
 This was a long shot, I know that. 
 Thank you for meeting me. 
 I--I really do appreciate it. 
 [mellow music] 
 Can I just leave this with you? 
 You don't have to get it back to me--  I'll come back and pick it up later--  but can I just leave it with you? 
 - Why? 
 - I think that you'll see  that your mother gave Jemma all the love  that she couldn't give to you.
