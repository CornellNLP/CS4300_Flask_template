 The Comeback - Season 1- Episode 8 "Valerie Relaxes in Palm Springs" 
 What's the catch? 
 There's no catch, Marky-Mark. 
 They're giving us a brand new navigator All right. We just have to use it in "The Comeback." 
 So there is a catch. 
 Well, catch or freebie? 
 I've always wanted to drive one of these things. 
 Well... 
 It's big. 
 Big car for a big man. 
 I'm really looking forward to our little Palm Springs getaway. 
 It's gonna be nice, just us. 
 And the two cameras and the crew. 
 We're gonna get some shots of you driving, right? 
 No, you should just relax and enjoy the trip. 
 Yes, get shots of us driving. 
 Yeah, I think we just have the one camera and sound. 
 Oh, just like our honeymoon. 
 Isn't he something? He's, you know... 
 He could tell I was a little down last week, you know, 'cause they canceled the Sassy episode, and he just put everything on hold to take a long weekend, spend some much needed downtime with his lady in the desert. It's nice. 
 He's a good guy. 
 Oh, that's a great idea. 
 Honey, will you grab my golf clubs too? 
 You want to golf? 
 Yeah, I got some real cute golf clothes. 
 So yeah, I do. 
 That'll be a good shot. 
 Morning. 
 Beautiful day for a drive. Hi. 
 Bill Hartwick, press rep, Lincoln Mercury. 
 Thank you so much. We're real excited. 
 Oh, it's our pleasure, believe me. 
 And you must be Jane. Okay, really looking forward to the trip. 
 This car handles real well. 
 Could you say "the navigator handles real well"? 
 I'm sorry? 
 When you say something about the car Could you mention the name? Like "the navigator has comfortable seats," or "the navigator has individual seat warming or cooling controls." 
 Yeah, okay. 
 The naviga... 
 I forgot what I said. 
 This navigator handles real well. 
 There, done. 
 Oh, it's my agent. 
 Probably calling about the "Room and Bored" situation. Hello. 
 Could you put it on the speaker? 
 Valerie, hold for Joe. 
 Thank you. 
 Val? 
 Oh hi, Joe. 
 Listen, you're on speaker, Mr. Agent man, so no bad news, huh? 
 Okay, what's up, doll? 
 "Room and bored" is officially shut down for a retool. 
 Oops. 
 Looks like we have to find another code word for bad news, 'cause bad news didn't work. 
 Uh, uh... yeah no. 
 Tom and Paulie G already told me about that, yeah. 
 Yeah, everyone's happy with what you're doing, but they think that last episode went off-track. 
 In their words, they're "refocusing to chase the youth. " Well, I'll tell you one thing that is chasing the youth away, It's that running suit they put me in... You know, Joe? Oh, "call ended." Yeah, this area's a bitch for cell reception. Oh yeah, well, he'll call back. "Chase the youth." That's hollywood for you. You know, anyone over 22, mandatory hip replacement. So... you know what, I'm done. Here. Don't let me make any more calls about the show. Right. I'm serious, Mark. No, just put it in your pocket, okay? We're going to Palm Springs to get away, all right? Biz... show business stops here and now. How about some music? Marky-Mark loves his music. I bet this car... the navigator has a great sound system. The Lincoln navigator is the first in its class to offer a cinema-quality sound system. Yeah, he's not gonna say that. Oh, that's fine. All right, well, what do we have? We have Eric Clapton, the Allmann Brothers... Cheap Trick and Bob Seger. And I know we have some current hits in air. Oh, here's one we love, Mary J. "Bilge." It's Blige. No, you're wrong. It's Blige. Put in Cheap Trick. We can't play any music, because if we can't afford it or can't clear it, then the whole trip's unusable. Right. We can't listen to music? Well, then they can't use it. I heard her. All right. I'm sorry. That's all right. What are we gonna do for the next two hours? If we can't listen to music. Well, I for one am gonna just sit here quietly. Let all the Hollywood stress go. Start to relax. Do you? No. Not even thinking about show business. Remember this? Yeah. Yeah, oh. W uniforms. Hello hello hello ! Well, here we are in relaxing Palm Springs and... Yeah? We have to do it again. There was a problem with the camera move. Again? Yeah. We gotta do it again. It's all right. They just wanna get it right, you know. Hold up ! Hold up ! It's gonna be a long weekend with this guy. Ugh, I know it. Jeez. Okay, rolling ! Come on out. Do you wanna? No, I'm on vacation. Well, here we are in Palm Springs ready to relax. Should we just leave the car here? Uh, "should we just leave the navigator here?" Jane, he's gonna have to stop. He's gonna have to stop doing that. Welcome to the Parker Palm Springs, Mrs. Cherish. Oh, thank you. Wow ! This place is different. The hotel has just gone through an extensive renovation. I'll say, yeah. When we were here last, the lobby was all... white couches and very elegant chaise lounges. Right, very old Hollywood. It hasn't been like this for two years. Two years? No, wait. It can't have been that long since we were here. Well, yeah, I remember the last time we were here I threw my back out playing golf and had to put on those bengay hot adhesive strips on my lower back. Yeah. That was like... Oh, look at that ! Oh Jane, isn't that fun? You getting that? Yeah. Aw. It's so fun, that piece. You know, compliments to the decorator. Really, great look, the whole. Would you like to go to see your room? Oh yes, I would. Look at that. It's a sheep, but it's a chair. It's a sheep chair. Yeah, no. It's really great. So hip, you know. Ooh ! Hi, do you know... Are these chairs taken here? I'm sorry. Hi. I'm wondering, are all these chairs taken? Yeah, my boyfriend and my friends. Oh, so you're saving one, two, three, four, five chairs then? Sorry, we got up real early to get these chairs. What is all this? Oh, right, we're filming a reality show. The actually wanted to get a shot me. We're hoping to on one of these pool chairs, You know, just outside my room. That's my room right there. Right directly behind us. It's a straight line. Can't miss it. Yeah, that's my room next to yours. Oh, is it? Yeah. Do you know when these chairs will be available? I don't know. Everybody's taking naps. Oh. Right, okay, uh-Huh. I'd sit over there, but I can't be in the direct sun, you know. I'm a redhead, so I'm not allowed. I'll move my ipod. You can have one. That's awfully sweet of you. It really is, really. But actually I need two. Because I'm waiting for my husband. He's coming out. So I guess I need two, so all right. Yeah, you got that? I don't need to see that ! I thought I left that all behind me. Mark? Hey. I shouldn't yell. It's not a tenement. Just wanted to know we're over here. Oh, hi. I read the new revisions. I wanna make sure we're all on the same page budget-wise. The studio, they're just not happy. I don't wanna hear that. Oh, let it go, Val. Decide what you wanna eat. Oh, I know what I want. Good. Well, we'll eat something and then we'll squeeze in nine holes. All right. Oh, great. Here comes a cigar. Perfect, perfect. That's a good cigar. Is it? You know, that reminds me, you know who we should see while we're here? Who? Don and Donna Franklin. You know, Jane, that could be fun. We should have them on the show, Have'em for dinner or something. He used to work with Mark, and she is quite a character. You know, she has a real big personality, Tons of fun, yeah. Great. Yeah. All right, guys, you know what you'd like? Yes, oh yes, I would like a little lunch in a lounge chair. Near my room, please. Yeah, bummer, everyone kind of stakes out their claims early here. Yeah, well, that's good to know. What time usually? How early? Uh, like 7:00. Wow, so you have to set the alarm so you could get up and relax? Yeah. I am going to have the tiger shrimp tempura with the ponzu dipping sauce. And I am going to have the salad with the poached chicken and pear, please. Oh, is that on the menu? Oh sure, yeah. No, I get it all the time. Yeah, it's called the... Angie Dickinson. Uh, the who? Yeah, I'll get, um... I'll just have a salad then. Oh, awesome. Okay, which one? Yeah, the uh... the $25 one.

Right there. There we go. Now easy backswing and... okay, you're done. My turn. I was just trying to have some fun. I know, but they're trying to play through. So let me go and then... He's gonna go. Someone's in the doghouse. Agh ! Jesus ! f*ck ! What? Mark, that was good. No... it wasn't. Val, would you come over here and just take this? Could you get the cameras outta here? Why are you so upset? Because I don't want them filming this. We have a camera in the bedroom, but this is where you draw the line? This is golf. Okay. Okay But wait. I want one more shot. So just go over there, turn your phone off and don't say anything. Okay, okay. He's gonna take another shot. Is everything okay? Yeah, shh. Be quiet. Now go. Yeah? Yeah. All right. Well, that was fun. We're gonna get back now. How's he gonna get back? Oh, he's a big boy. He'll figure it out. Just check my messages. Who called? Okay. Ahem, yeah. Mark, that was Don and Donna. They're on for 7:00. Oh ! Okay, he heard me. I'm just gonna get in. He was driving, I don't know... Okay, all right. It goes fast. Marky-Mark, how do you like that chair? You know, it's pretty comfortable. It's not quite as comfortable as the seats in the navigator. There, I think we did our duty. Oh, here they are. Hello hello hello ! Hey ! So you found us? How could we miss you? You're the two old farts with the camera. Can you believe this crazy place? The only thing missing is Dean Martin and the Golddiggers. Oh, what'd I tell you? Tons of fun, huh? And who is this with the gorgeous skin? This is Jane, our producer. Oh, hi, "Jane our producer," we're Don and Donna, the double Ds. Need I say more? Well... tons of fun. So anyway, we thought we could have drinks here and then go into town for dinner. Oh, Val, honey, between the gays and the grays, this town is a zoo. Let's just eat here. Is that okay with you, Don? As long as I don't have to sit in a chair with fur. That's for you, big guy. Hey, now we're talkin'. Grab my purse, then I'm gonna... Okay. Don't really... know them that well. They're business acquaintances of Mark's. So you know, I've met Don a couple times and you know... I just met her a couple times. Always seemed fun. No, yeah ! I'm running a production company... Why would I? I can do everything I did there, But here I live off the 18th green. If they ever find a way to hook up a computer to a golf bag, He'll never come home. That would be a nice idea if I was a moron, but I'm not. I cannot make this movie... ...doing it all afternoon at the pool, and now he's doing it at dinner. You want me to say something? No no, it's not. Hey, Mr. Hollywood ! Hold it down. The geriatric set is trying to talk. There. Done. Yeah. You know, before the cancer I would have just sat here and fumed. But now... You did know I had cancer? No, I didn't. It was in our holiday newsletter. Oh, who really reads those things, right? I mean... If it's not about my family, I don't give a f*ck. Oh, relax, Valerie. I'm fine now. And I got to keep both my tits ! And besides, it's a reality show, right? Cancer's part of reality. Yes yes. And it is a part of reality... It is. ...you know. 
 
 Would anyone like dessert? Sure, absolutely. Love dessert. Yes ! There you go. Thanks. And how's your evening going? Hi. Hi. Hi. Bill Hartwick, I gave them their navigator. So... uh, you have a good evening. Okay, good night. Val? Yeah. Jane, he has to stop doing that. Well, it's 2:00 A. M. And as you can hear, Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood next door are having a party. And I've called the desk twice now, and Mark has taken a sleeping pill. I have not taken a sleeping pill, Because I have to get up early in the morning so I can get two decent pool chairs... you know. Listen to that ! Unbelievable ! Just 'cause someone doesn't know how to leave work behind and simply relax, you know? Now everyone else has to pay the price. I have to. All right, well, I'm gonna try to go to bed. I'm just gonna try now. Valerie? I think I hear something. Jane, what time is it? It's 10:30. What? Oh, What, what? It's 10:30. It's... No no, Mark ! We slept in ! What? We slept in. Can I see? Are there chairs at the pool? There're no chairs at the pool. There are no chairs left at the pool, Mark. What? That's it, that's it. There're no chairs. The whole day is ruined ! What can we do? I don't know ! We're screwed ! The day is ruined ! Ok, we'll be out. We'll be out in a second. God, this sun is delicious. What's the matter? Nothing, I'm just so hot.

If it's bothering you so much just go over there and tell you wanna use the empty chairs You want better go? It's fine ! it really is ! You can't keep these feelings. You'll get sick ! Words to live by ! Thank you ! You know. Valerie? We don't know each other very well but... can I say something? Sure ! You have to stop worrying so much about what people think ! Okay.

Oh, are you having fun? Who's there? Oh, the whole cast and Tom, some of the writers. You know, Paulie was so cute trying to make us all relax about the retooling thing. All right, sounds like fun but... Like I said, I'm out of town relaxing with Mark so... That explains it. 'Cause I asked Paulie where you were. He's always joking like, oh, "she's not invited." Okay, all right, listen ! I'm in the middle of dinner so when I get home I'm gonna call you, okay? Okay have fun. Miss you. You too. All right, bye. Sweet. As your newfound spiritual advisor, I advise you to get some of those feelings out. I'm fine. Okay, then, as Donna, I advise us to get a lot of more drinks. Oh, well... Mas tequila, por favor ! Muy bueno, senor ! Let's have our own party, huh? You know, one time Donna and I were in Acapulco, We rented two burros and a guide who took us to the top of this mountain... Mm-hmm, now.
