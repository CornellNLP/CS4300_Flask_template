 (Tour guide speaking indistinctly over P.A.) 
 Gerald : You know, this is the first time I've seen you and Lee out outside of work. 
 He wanted to see the sights. 
 I thought he'd like this. 
 Aw, that's nice, Carter. 
 Look at you two, getting all close. 
 "Close"? 
 No, Lee and I are just friendly, all right? 
 But that's just professional respect. 
 (laughs evilly) 
 Tour guide : No? Whatever. 
 Uh, welcome to the L.A. Notorious Tour: A Voyage Into the Macabre. 
 Our first stop is the home of silent film director... 
 William Desmond Taylor! 
 William Desmond Taylor, whose notorious murder was never solved. 
 Well... they had a dozen suspects, okay? But they told the cops to just back off. 
 Why? 
 Oh, because this is Hollywood, baby. (laughs) 
 Listen, this case just got too explosive, too many dirty hands... 
 (Gerald continuing indistinctly) 
 How does Gerald know this? 
 Man, this is Gerald's thing. 
 When he was little, Grandma would let him stay up late with her on the sofa, to watch murder mystery and unsolved crime type shows. 
 I mean, it takes him to his happy place. 
 Death and murder bring him good memories? 
 This guide... he's terrible. 
 He doesn't know his history. 
 He don't even know his lines. 
 Look at him, he's just reading off the card. 
 That should be me up there. 
 You're very knowledgeable on this topic. 
 Oh, yeah, you know, always been a dream of mine to teach or lecture at a university level o-or be a tour guide. 
 (Tour Guide continues in background) 
 We're pulling up to... 
 Le Chateau Franc! 
 Built in the year... 
 1886. 
 Popular with celebrities... 
 Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe, and James... 
 Dean! 
 I was gonna say Franco. It's the place for the elite to meet and greet. 
 But it's also famous for its, uh, notorious guests... 
 The Black Dahlia, the Hillside Strangler, Tommy Shea's last stand. 
 Tommy Shea? 
 This leafy oasis for the rich and famous, might just as well be the gateway to Hell! 
 I was just going to say that. 
 Really, ninja? 
 You was just about to say, "leafy oasis"? 
 Really, you had that locked and loaded and ready to go? 
 Man, watch out. 
 Oh, so many have come to this premises, never to be seen again!

 Man, being a cop is like having homework every night, for the rest of your life. 
 I enjoy the opportunity to put my thoughts on paper, gain new insights. 
 (imitates buzzer) 
 What was that? 
 The button that operates the trap door under your chair. 
 It helps me. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hello, there, how may I protect and serve you? 
 Carter, I got this. 
 It's a missing person. 
 My sister. 
 I-I wasn't sure I could file a report. 
 It's only been two days. 
 You did the right thing. I'm Detective Carter. 
 Call me James. 
 I'm Heather. Heather Lamb. 
 Miss Lamb says that her sister, Destiny, left home with Heather's credit card and driver's license. 
 She's a thief? 
 She's just young and impulsive. 
 The last charge was two nights ago at Le Chateau Franc. 
 That was on Gerald's bus tour. 
 Interesting spot. 
 Very Hollywood. 
 She wants to be an actress. 
 She heard it's the place to be if you want to be discovered. 
 I have a picture of her. 
 You could be twins. 
 (wry laugh) She's five years younger. 
 That's why she takes my I.D. 
 She's just a kid. 
 She still likes sparkly things. 
 Has she done this before? 
 A few times. But she always calls. 
 I tried reaching her, but her cell is off. 
 I have a really bad feeling. 
 Captain, this is Heather Lamb. 
 She's here to report her sister's missing. 
 Last known location: Le Chateau Franc. 
 Le Chateau? 
 She's a lovely girl. 
 We'll do everything we can, but I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. 
 You're in very good hands here. 
 Didi. 
 Check all emergency calls or Jane Does; anything that might be relevant to this young lady. 
 Okay, I found a 911 call. 
 Now, it's hard to make out, but it pinged a tower near Le Chateau Franc. 
 Male operator : 911, what is your emergency? 
 Woman (staticky) : Can you hear... 
 Don't hang up! 
 Male operator : Um, I'm right here. 
 What is your name, miss? 
 (staticky): Dest... amb. 
 She say Destiny Lamb? 
 Ssh. 
 Male operator : I-I can't understand you. 
 Can you say that again? 
 Woman (staticky) : ...closet... it's dark... 
 Hello? 
 Male operator : What is your location? 
 Woman : I'm at the... 
 (voice dropping out) 
 Male operator : Ma'am, are you there? Ma'am? 
 Ma'am? 
 That was it. 
 When did this come in? 
 Two nights ago. 
 That's the night Destiny went missing. 
 You know what, when I was a detective, a very distraught woman came into the station one day. 
 She told me that her daughter had gone to meet friends at Le Chateau and never came back. 
 She was 17. 
 I told her we'd do everything we could to get her daughter back but... we never did. 
 Soon... there was another mother with another daughter, and then another one... and in the course of one year, seven girls went missing, all in the vicinity of Le Chateau Franc, and all of them looking very much like her. 
 Oh, God. 
 Captain, are we looking at a missing person or a homicide? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Carter : Understated. 
 Elegant. 
 These are my kind of people. 
 It's just a hotel. 
 What? 
 Do you know who stay here? 
 Kimye, Riri, J and Bae, only the best of the best. 
 Gerald : What up, though! 
 Uh! 
 What's Gerald doing here? 
 Oh, I heard you was going to be at the Le Chateau. 
 From who? 
 Oh, oops. 
 I didn't know he was gonna show up. 
 Lee, listen to me, I know everything about this place. 
 Please, allow me to drop some knowledge on you. 
 Please. 
 You have ten seconds. 
 (laughing): Oh, you gonna love this. 
 (Gerald laughs) 
 Give me something ominous. 
 (dramatic piano chord plays) 
 (Gerald laughs) 
 Hey, thank you for the opportunity... 
 Carter : Five... four, three... 
 Tommy Shea was a serial killer who lured young ladies into the Le Chateau, never to be heard from again. 
 Shea? Where is he now? 
 He's dead, in a massive fire in the Le Chateau. 
 How does that help us now? 
 Because I think the Le Chateau is straight up haunted. 
 What? 
 Haunted? 
 It's a working theory. 
 Welcome to Le Chateau Franc. 
 Guys are kind of busy today. 
 Is there a special event? 
 Yes, we call it Tuesday. 
 (forced laughter) 
 This girl was last seen here two days ago. 
 Does she seem familiar? 
 What is this about? 
 Anywhere we could talk... 
 Reg? 
 (clears throat) 
 It's, uh... it's Reginald. 
 This could be any one of a thousand girls. 
 Frankly, all their faces start to blur together after awhile. 
 Lee : She has disappeared. 
 Doesn't Le Chateau already have a shady history? 
 Every hotel has its share of problems. 
 Forgive and, uh, forget, right? 
 What is it, Tara? 
 A dog that fits the description of Jessica Alba's Maltipoo just bit someone. 
 Should I comp the usual wine? 
 Reg : Why do people insist on bringing animals into the hotel? 
 Have you seen this girl? 
 Yeah, I saw her and some dude rounding second base in the elevator the other night. 
 They were in the big suite. 
 Well, there you have it, boys. 
 Mystery solved. 
 Can you tell us who was in the big suite two nights ago, Reg? 
 Of course, it's my job to serve. (wry laugh) 
 That would be, uh, Joel Schmertz. 
 Schmertz. 
 Schmertz. 
 Do you have an address for Schmertz? 
 (chuckles) Course. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 There's no way whoever lives here dropped a grand at the suite at Le Chateau. 
 You Schmertz? 
 What's this about? 
 LAPD. 
 Everything okay, Joel? 
 It's fine. Some cars were broken into. 
 Wait inside, sweetie. 
 Well, we already know you're a liar. 
 We have a witness that places you and Destiny together at the Chateau, two days ago. 
 I thought her name was Heather. 
 Destiny. So let's start with how you two met. 
 Look, I have a secret account. 
 Okay? Every now and then, I go out alley-catting. 
 You know, I meet women. 
 You sure you guys don't want to come inside? 
 I could get you some coffee. 
 They don't want to come inside, baby. 
 I love you. 
 Two lies. 
 So, Joel Schmertz of RP Auto Parts waltzes into Le Chateau Franc, and somehow that's catnip for a young lady like Destiny. 
 No, dude, I-I suit up. 
 I rent a nice car. 
 She says she's an actress, I say I'm a producer. 
 It's role-play. It's fantasy. 
 You have a family with another child on the way. 
 Isn't your life already a fantasy? 
 (laughter in distance) 
 I actually think it helps my marriage. 
 Should we test that theory? 
 What about the girl? 
 Look, I passed out, drunk. 
 I woke up around 5:00 a.m., and... 
 Heather or Destiny or whatever the hell her name is was already gone... along with my credit card. 
 I'm the real victim here. 
 All right, it's not that we don't believe your story. 
 We don't. 
 We like it so much that we're gonna bring you to the station, so everybody can hear. 
 Congratulations, you are the lead suspect in a missing persons case. 
 It's not hyperbole, man. My wife's gonna kill me. 
 Shut up, Schmertz. 
 I heard Carter took you on a little tour of L.A. the other day. 
 I think you guys are becoming besties. 
 Lee : What's besties? 
 What's besties?! 
 BFFs. Best friends "fo-eva." 
 No. Carter is a work acquaintance. 
 Okay. 
 Hello, colleague. 
 Hello, associate. 
 So, we checked out Schmertz's suite at Le Chateau. 
 Perfectly clean. 
 We'll find something to hold him on. 
 There's something else. 
 Someone just tried to use Schmertz's credit card at a gas station in Inglewood. 
 Was it Destiny? 
 No.

 The guy was so drunk, he just left it. 
 He was a tool. I can't believe she actually bought his B.S. about being a producer. 
 Do you know where they went afterwards? 
 Look, last I saw, they were canoodling and they left together. 
 I swear. I was at the bar till 6:00 with my crew. You can ask anyone. 
 He's making up words. "Canoodling" is not a word. 
 No, canoodling is like when two people get together and fool around.

 You meet Alice yet? 
 Just once. 
 Detective Carter. 
 Oh, hey, hey, Alice. How you doin'? 
 Hi. 
 Okay. Hi, Detective Lee. 
 Look at your cute little suit. 
 Uh, I'll tell you more about me, Alice. 
 My specialty is forensic anthropology, but I'm also a pathologist. 
 What I really want to do is be out in the field, go to crime scenes, check out spatter, say things like, "Get these people back! Back, I say! 
 I said back!" (chuckles) 
 I would definitely stay back. 
 (chuckling): You're so funny. 
 People think I'm weird 'cause I work with dead people. But I love it. 
 They're like, "How do you get the dead smell out of your hair?" I'm like, "I wash it with lemons." 
 Not that complicated. 
 Yes, I talk a lot when I'm nervous. 
 Doesn't make me bad at my job. (chuckles) 
 I'm very good at my job. 
 I'm very happy for you. 
 
 
 
 Okay. Moving on. 
 This is a femur. Most people have two femurs. Trouble is, this little boneyard has not two but one, two, three femurs. 
 There was more than one victim? 
 Yes. This collection represents the remains of several ex-humans. 
 And a lot of teeth. 
 Zoomp. (pops lips) Which, due to the hardness of their enamel, can withstand high temperatures. 
 Is Destiny in there, anywhere? 
 I can neither deny nor confirm. 
 Any other questions? 
 Detective Lee, perhaps? 
 Can you identify the ex-humans? 
 That's a great question. 
 The odontologist will work the chompers and I'll work the bones, and we'll get back to you. 
 What's the best number to reach you when that happens? 
 Oh, well, that's actually... 
 Um, well... 
 Detective Lee. 
 I can't believe the googly eyes she was making at you. 
 Googly eyes? 
 "Detective Lee, you're so funny." I've known her for years. 
 Five seconds with you, and she's all googly-eyed. 
 Carter, do you like Alice? 
 That's not the point. 
 The point is you don't make googly eyes at a man's partner. 
 It's rude. Of course I like Alice. 
 Detectives, my office. 
 I understand they turned up multiple remains at Le Chateau. 
 We're headed over there now. 
 S.I.D. are on site. 
 What do you guys know about Thomas Shea? 
 He was a serial killer. 
 Died in a fire at Le Chateau. 
 He was a true psychopath. 
 I mean, would torture small animals as a kid, that sort of thing. 
 That's the first sign of a psychopath. 
 That or having the middle name Wayne. 
 And after college, he took his trust, which was in the tens of millions, and moved to L.A. to try to make it as an actor. 
 "What's that all about?" 
 This guy could have lived anywhere, but he chose Le Chateau, because at the time, it was kind of the decadent, chic place to be. 
 "What's that all about?" 
 "What's... that all about?" 
 Right around this time was when the disappearances started happening. 
 (The Go-Go's "Our Lips Are Sealed" playing in background) 
 "What's that all about?" 
 Shea would go out into the area and lure young women back to Le Chateau. 
 Maybe I'll tone it down a notch. 
 One girl escaped, which is how we found out about him. 
 He had told her that she had three days to live, and each night he would count them down. 
 How cinematic. 
 When they tried to arrest him, he barricaded his room, doused the entire place with gasoline, and set it on fire. 
 I was there. I was... on that operation. 
 I always hated the fact that Shea got to end things on his own terms. 
 I mean, it just... (scoffs) it felt like he won. 
 But he died. 
 Yeah. And so did all those girls. 
 All those pretty, young, naive girls. 
 Like Destiny. 
 Think we may have a copycat? 
 This is all way to familiar. 
 Destiny's been missing for two days now. 
 So if someone was taking a page from Shea's playbook... 
 We don't have that much time. 
 (shouting): Is all of...? 
 (normal voice): Is all of this absolutely necessary? 
 If there's anything resembling human remains, we have to dig. 
 The noise... it reverberates through the entire hotel. 
 There's a record release party just upstairs. 
 Wiz Khalifa is gonna be here in half an hour. 
 You don't know who Wiz Khalifa is. 
 Does...? He doesn't know who Wiz Khalifa is? 
 I'm surprised you know who Wiz Khalifa is. 
 You do appreciate that human remains were found on the premises, right? 
 Reg : I'm just asking for a little discretion. 
 May I borrow this from you? 
 Sure. No problem. 
 Carter : Okay, I'm gonna need you to calm the hell down. 
 How long have you been manager, Reg? 
 For the last five wonderful years, since the renovation. 
 After the fire. 
 Wha-What? What? 
 What are... what are you doing? 
 You have mice. 
 No, no, no, you're not gonna knock any walls down now. 
 No, we have cats for that. 
 I... Bosco? Bosco! 
 Reg : The plaster on these walls was brought here all the way... 
 Shut up. 
 (sighs) 
 Okay, videogames in the dark... 
 Shut up, or I will arrest you. 
 Whoa! 
 What's behind the wall? 
 I saw a face. 
 Nothing. 
 There's someone behind the wall. 
 Kind of impossible, right? 
 No! 
 You break it, you buy it. 
 (panting) 
 Hey! 
 (panting, yells) 
 (debris clinking) 
 (grunts) 
 (panting) 
 (grunts) 
 (panting) 
 Who or what did we just chase? 
 Alice... 
 Captain Cole. 
 ...the remains from Le Chateau... they were all female, weren't they? 
 So far. 
 And they were recent? 
 Yes, these girls were all killed within the last five years. 
 We cross-referenced missing persons reports from the surrounding area with dental records. 
 Dental records. 
 We were able to ascertain the I.D.'s of three of the victims... all young women between the ages of 18 and 22. 
 Rachael Paradis, Brittany Hess, Jamie Harper. 
 All similar ages, builds and ethnicities. 
 Our killer has a type. 
 Oh, my God. 
 This is like 12 years ago all over again. 
 And what about our missing person, Destiny Lamb? 
 Nothing yet, but we're still working. 
 Okay, well, you call me as soon as you know. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 And... nice job. 
 Thank you. 
 We're strong women. 
 Like a bird, right out of my mouth. 
 Lawyered up, Reg? 
 That doesn't make you look guilty at all. 
 This is America, fellas. 
 People have rights. Spread the word. 
 Look, I already told you everything that I know. 
 Stop speaking. If you had anything on my client, you would have arrested him, but you don't, so, buh-bye. 
 We found the cell phone of our missing person under your hotel. 
 Hmm. You could have found my dog's balls down there. 
 That doesn't make my client a vet. 
 Where's Destiny, Reg? 
 You two have a beautiful life. 
 I feel bad for her dog. 
 Reg was in charge of that renovation. 
 He knows something. 
 Where are we gonna find someone that's gonna tell us about that damn tunnel? 
 Once again, guys, I'd like to thank you for this opportunity. 
 Man, just tell us about the tunnels. 
 Oh, okay... uh, wait. One question: So, um, on my resume do I put, "Consultant to the LAPD," or do I just...? 
 Carter : Five, four, three... 
 Never mind that. 
 We can discuss that later. Uh... 
 (clears throat) Okay. 
 Did you know that, during Prohibition, Le Chateau Franc was a speakeasy? 
 A speakeasy? 
 Yes. 
 An illegal nightclub. 
 Now that tunnel... that's how they used to move the hooch in and out, so they wouldn't get caught by the popo. 
 Even though the popo were the main customers. 
 No offense, popo. 
 Those tunnels been there for years? 
 Oh, they have miles of tunnels running underneath this... 
 Here, let me show you something... check this out. 
 You stole that from the library. 
 It's a lending library, Lee. 
 I lent it. 
 Okay, this is an old and rare schematic of downtown Los Angeles. 
 Okay? It shows all the tunnels running underneath. 
 Right here in the center... that's Le Chateau. 
 So somebody could have used the tunnels to abduct these girls. 
 Lee : And smuggle them back to Le Chateau, without anybody noticing. 
 Just like hooch to a speakeasy. 
 Lee : These three dots represent our three missing girls. 
 These tunnels align with their last known locations. 
 Right here in the center is Le Chateau. 
 We think our copycat was taking advantage of the access to do his crazy work. 
 Captain? 
 I just heard from Alice. 
 Destiny was not among the remains. 
 Carter : That means she could still be alive. 
 She might be in one of the tunnels. 
 Cole : No. If she's still alive, then she's in Le Chateau. 
 They were all in Le Chateau. 
 Carter : We searched it from top to bottom. 
 Yeah, well, then you missed something. 
 Maybe we should bring Reg back in. 
 No, it isn't Reg. 
 Captain, if we're dealing with a copycat killer... 
 We are not dealing with a copycat, Detective. 
 Our-our mistake that night was we-we came in too heavy. 
 Shea was ready for us. 
 It's almost as if someone had warned him that we were coming. 
 Captain... what happened that night? 
 What haven't you told us?

 You know, and everyone told me that there was no way that Shea could have survived that fire, but we never found any remains. 
 You said you found his teeth. 
 Yeah, but believe me, he could have pulled them himself, and just left them there, so we'd think he was dead. 
 And he knew all about those tunnels. 
 I mean, he could have decided just to hide out until the coast was clear. 
 You saying you think Shea is still alive? 
 Oh, I had my suspicions then... 
 ...but when I saw the pictures of those girls in that coroner's office, I knew. 
 This isn't a copycat. 
 It's Shea.

 S.I.D. was able to isolate a partial fingerprint from Destiny's cell phone that wasn't hers. 
 Reg? 
 No. Thomas Shea. 
 Shea? 
 Yeah. 
 And the reason that we were only able to get a partial print was because the finger pad was damaged. 
 There was scar tissue. 
 Like a burn victim. 
 The captain was right. 
 Shea's still alive. 
 I swore I'd never come back to this place. 
 It's so weird. 
 It-it just feels smaller, like the whole configuration is off. 
 They renovated after the fire. 
 Yeah, but why would a hotel lose space during a renovation? 
 You know, there used to be a staircase right over there. 
 That's how we got up to Shea's room. 
 Destiny : ...closet... it's-it's dark. 
 Carter : What is it, Lee? 
 I think I know how Destiny's phone ended up in that tunnel. 
 Lee? 
 On Destiny's 911 call, she... she mentioned something about a... 
 Closet. 
 (door squeaks open) 
 Straight up from The Chronicles of Narnia. 
 Let's get this sick son of a bitch. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 (ringtone plays) 
 Didi, what's up? 
 Reg and Shea know each other. Reg's real name (staticky): is Joseph Block. 
 Hello? 
 ...was abandoned by his mother as a child... 
 Didi, I'm getting, like, every other word. 
 He worked for the family for years, and then... 
 Reg was arrested for manslaughter and the Sheas got him off. 
 This is probably why Destiny's 911 call was so messed up. 
 He's indebted to them. 
 He's gonna warn Shea that you're coming. 
 Didi... you're breaking up. 
 Okay, we got to go find Shea. 
 Hello? Carter? Please tell me you just heard everything I just said. 
 (phone beeping) 
 Call just dropped. 
 This must be a dead zone. 
 I found a door. 
 ("Our Lips Are Sealed" playing in distance) 
 It's still here. 
 They just built around it. 
 (music continues in distance) 
 Y'all hear that? 
 It's him. 
 All right, let's get it right this time. 
 ♪ Doesn't matter what they say ♪ 
♪ In the jealous games people play ♪ 
♪ Our lips are sealed... ♪ 
♪ There's a weapon ♪ 
♪ That we must use... ♪ 
 (needle scratches, music stops) 
 Destiny! 
 Destiny... 
 It's okay. It's okay, honey. 
 We gotcha, we gotcha. Don't worry. 
 It's all right. 
 (gunshot) 
 Cole : Hold on to me. It's okay. 
 Lee! 
 Carter! 
 I got this! Go! 
 Now, listen, full disclosure, I fight a little dirty, but... hey, that doesn't mean you have to. 
 Think fast. 
 I'm going after my partner. 
 I, uh, heard a commotion. 
 Huh? 
 You ever seen Goodfellas? 
 No. 
 No? Hey, superb picture. 
 Ray Liotta is a revelation. 
 You know, the producers originally didn't want him. 
 Thought he lacked charm. 
 Carter : Shoot him! 
 I can't shoot him... you're on top of him. 
 Shoot around me! 
 All right, flip him over. 
 Why did I kill those girls? 
 Well... because I felt like it. 
 Get me running through a tunnel! Get my Jordans dirty! 
 Shame on you, bringing a serving tray to a gunfight. 
 Shea : You're just a guest in my hotel. 
 And now you're really pissing me off! 
 You know what the difference is between you and me? 
 You want to live, but I don't care if you die. 
 Some people are just born bad. 
 (groans) Son of a bitch! 
 You're not really my type, either, Shea. 
 Is he dead? 
 Finally. 
 He wouldn't shut up. 
 Didi says Reg funded the renovation using a shell company set up by Shea. 
 He used multiple contractors, so no one knew what they were building. 
 (scoffs) Only in L.A. 
 Yeah. 
 You were right. 
 EMT says most of Shea's teeth were pulled out. 
 That's how he faked his death years ago. 
 No, he was smart. 
 Not smart enough to fool you. 
 No; I always get my man. 
 Eventually. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, I think your partner is looking for you. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you okay? 
 I was shot. 
 Does it count if the bullet only went through your jacket? 
 I was shot psychologically, okay? 
 I have to live with the trauma. 
 I'm just glad you're all right. 
 We are bests. 
 What? 
 Uh, bests... 
 Are you trying to say "besties"? 
 I'm glad you're okay, too, man. 
 And Destiny will be fine. 
 Time for my googly eyes. 
 Wait here. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Detective Carter. 
 Call me James. 
 James, I mean, you're a true hero. 
 Uh, well, you know, I have been known to save a life or two. 
 I don't know how to thank you. 
 Uh, well, how long are you gonna be in town? 
 You know, let me show you the sights. 
 I'm sorry, are... are you asking me out? Now? 
 Timing's not ideal? 
 Should I circle back? 
 We're leaving as soon as we can. 
 (voice breaking): I hate L.A. 
 Why are all the girls I like always leaving out of town? 
 Carter : Man, I thought you said we was going to that "Booty and the Beach" pageant. 
 The 9:00 a.m. tour is way different. 
 (laughs) No way. 
 What are you guys doing here? Are you stalking me? (laughs) 
 We were already here when you showed up. 
 Detective Lee, it's me, Alice, in case you... didn't recognize me in my work clothes. 
 I just threw this on. 
 Oh! (chuckles) 
 It's so crowded. 
 Do you mind if I sit with you? 
 Uh... 
 We'll be tour bus buddies. 
 Oh. 
 You're very... cheerful, aren't you, Alice? 
 Well, you know what everyone says. 
 "The dead can't smile, so we have to smile for them." 
 Is that what everyone says? 
 Yeah. 
 Is that Lee's wife? 
 Again, Gerald? Seriously? 
 Will we be passing the Alexandria Hotel? 
 The ghost of Rudolph Valentino has been spotted on the 12th floor. 
 Ooh. 
 Ha-ha! 
 Man, watch out. Um, hah! 
 Hello, L.A. Notorious. How you feel? 
 (whooping, cheering) 
 Hollywood... the land of dreams, where everything that shines and sparkles is not what it seems! 
 (gasps) Who did this to you? 
 It's... it's just a scratch. 
 Gerald : ...otherwise known as the Australian Jack the Ripper! 
 (evil laughter) 
 Stay tuned for scenes from the next Rush Hour.
