 Gerald : What up, Carter? 
 Gerald! What it is, man? 
 Thanks for coming. 
 Ah! Hey, man, thanks for bringing me, bro. 
 Hey, look, you know, when you first hit me up and you was like, "Hey, I need you to help me help somebody move," my first thought was, "No!" 
 But then when you told me that somebody was a bikini model that was single and loved dudes with shaved heads and no job, I was like, "Sign me up!" (chuckles) 
 Ah! 
 It's almost too good to be true. 
 (chuckles) 
 Yeah. 
 Why are you smiling like that? 
 You mad at me for lying or mad at yourself for falling for it? 
 Combination of both. 
 Yeah. 
 It's a combination of both. 
 Yeah. 
 So, uh, who we here to help then? 
 Take a guess. 
 Who's your favorite Asian detective? 
 Gerald : You know Lucy Liu?! Oh, my God! 
 I... 
 Oh. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. 
 Carter : Hey! There he is! 
 Detective Lee. Where are your things? 
 Right here. 
 Those are your things? Where's your stuff? 
 I don't have any stuff. 
 What do you mean you don't have any stuff? 
 This is America. We love stuff. 
 I know. My country makes that stuff. 
 And... done. 
 Glad we brought the truck. 
 So where's your new place? 
 Uh, I haven't found one yet. 
 You haven't found one? 
 Lee, if you don't have a new apartment, then why are you leaving this one? 
 I saw my landlord smoking in the lobby. 
 The lobby is a no-smoking zone. 
 So I wrote him a citation. 
 The next day, my rent was raised to $10 million a month. 
 You know what? 
 I don't think that was a coincidence. 
 I think he did that to get back at you. 
 Right? 
 I think you're a genius. 
 Well, there are plenty "for rent" signs. I'll stop at the next one I see. 
 Lee, if you will allow me to... just hear me out for a second, um, I think that plan is booty. Yeah, I mean, moving is a huge decision, man. 
 You can't just pick the first empty place you see. 
 You're not a hermit crab. 
 I'll tell you what, I'll help you find a place. 
 Why would you help me? 
 Because we're friends. And because we're friends that give each other a ten percent finder's fee for finding a apartment. 
 And it'll be a perfect place. None of these... run-down buildings with prostitutes and... 
 Well, unless you like prostitutes, then I can hook that up, too, you know what I'm saying? 
 I don't think I'll need your help. 
 Actually, Lee, I think you might. 
 And Gerald does know this city. 
 Yeah, man. Just tell me whatever you're looking for. 
 Location, amenities. 
 I'm just looking for a place that feels like home. 
 Koreatown. 
 I'm not Korean. 
 Not Koreatown. See? 
 We're already making progress as it is. 
 Let's go, baby! (chuckles)

 This new community center will be a safe and welcoming place for families to gather. 
 And as part of my ongoing commitment to veterans, a special wing will be dedicated to provide counseling and job placement to our proud servicemen and women. 
 On behalf of the City of Los Angeles, I am pleased to present the Boyle Heights City Community Center!

 Oh, come on! 
 Really?

 "Did this"? 
 Did wha...

 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 (reporters shouting questions) 
 We're still gathering information. 
 (reporters shouting questions) 
 I'm sorry, no comment. Geez. 
 A bunch of vultures. 
 Everything okay, Captain? 
 Oh, just super-duper, Carter. 
 We've got a politician who exploded and... a pack of rabid dogs back there just waiting to fan the flames. 
 So what can you guys tell me about this? 
 This was a targeted explosion. 
 Peña was the only intended victim. 
 You think it was political? 
 Peña didn't exactly take a lot of controversial positions. 
 People seemed to like him. 
 Yeah, well, not all people. 
 Carter : Apparently not. 
 Our bomber took extra care to make sure Peña didn't survive. 
 Found a few of these in the wreckage. 
 Shotgun shell? 
 Yeah. Military grade. 
 Added to the bomb as shrapnel for maximum damage. 
 We may be looking for someone with a military background. 
 Well, then get looking and find him fast. 
 And let's just hope that this was an isolated attack. 
 I just shutter to think about the panic that'll ensue if this guy strikes again. (sighs) 
 Find anything in the photos from the wreckage? 
 Not much survived the blast. 
 Just a set of inscribed golf clubs. 
 Carter : "K." Why would a man named Joseph Peña inscribe his clubs with a "K"? 
 Maybe they belonged to someone else? 
 Kevin Bacon? 
 Is he another councilman? 
 Yes. Councilman Kevin Bacon. 
 He's a firm supporter in your right to dance. 
 Didi, is that the footage from Mmm. 
 Peña's city council meetings? 
 Yeah. 
 Been looking through it for about an hour. 
 Find anything? 
 Yes, plenty of evidence to refute the belief that L.A. is filled with beautiful people. 
 And, more importantly, him. 
 You sit down! 
 You sit down! 
 This is... this is bull! 
 Damn. Man needs a hug. 
 Mm-mm, Dennis Peterson. 
 33 years old. 
 He's a regular at these city council meetings, and he really enjoys yelling. 
 Hey, this is B.S.! 
 Why is he so angry? 
 Didi : I don't know. Seems like something new every day. 
 But a reoccurring theme with him is veterans' rights. 
 He's military? 
 Ex-military. 
 He was discharged from the Marines five years ago for emotional instability. 
 If he's a former marine, then he might have access to military-grade shotgun shells, like the ones used in the bomb. 
 And he appears to have access to a bottomless pit of rage, also useful when making a bomb. 
 Hey, Didi, got Peterson's... 
 Marina Del Rey. 
 Get moving.

 Are you gonna do that every time the floor squeaks? 
 No. 
 But I would feel a little bit more at ease if that clock didn't keep going tick, tick, tick... 
 Boom! 
 Aah! 
 (Gerald grunting) 
 (chuckles nervously) 
 Is it a bad time? 
 What is wrong with you?! 
 Who jumps into a room and says the word "boom"? 
 Well, I was trying something different, man. 
 People seem to be getting tired of my, "What up, though?" 
 Anyway, I just came here to tell Lee that I found you a perfect place, man. 
 How did you know we were here? 
 Oh, I downloaded a cell phone app that tells your friends' GPS signal. 
 How does that help you find us? 
 Oh, I downloaded it on your phone, too. 
 Okay, Gerald, you need to go. 
 Wait! Hold on. 
 Why are you and Lee in an oceanfront, sunset views one-bedroom apartment? You after my commission, man? 
 You ain't getting no commission. 
 What you mean I'm not getting no commission? 
 I already said... 
 Get a job, Gerald. 
 Gerald : This is my job, Carter. 
 I got money coming from this, man. 
 I'm over here scouring the city looking for a perfect apartment, and it hurts me that you guys been out here searching on your own! 
 Carter : We're in a suspect's house, Gerald! 
 Carter. 
 ("Run Like the River" by Vintage Trouble playing) 
 Oh! Did you see that? 
 He's, like, Asian Batman. 
 That was nothing. I do Batman stuff all the time. 
 I ain't never seen it.

 Go ahead then, Young MC.

 There is nothing Batman about this. 
 You let that dude get away from you? 
 What happened? 
 Sun got in my eyes. 
 Did the sun push you in the ocean, too? Huh? 
 From my experience, it's usually not that aggressive. 
 Is everything okay with you? 
 You seem a little... off. 
 I think there's a fish in my pocket. 
 This is an illegal arrest! I didn't do anything wrong! 
 You threw a cop in the water. 
 Man wasn't even wearing his swimsuit. Feels pretty wrong to me. 
 Hold up, you... you threw him in the water? 
 You-you, Scary Busey, threw him, Asian Batman, in the water? 
 No. Uh-uh. 
 The sun got in my eyes. 
 I saw a guy coming at me, all right? I reacted. 
 Fight or flight... it's my marine training at work. 
 What did you do in the Marines? 
 I was a public affairs broadcast specialist. 
 The Marine audio visual club? 
 We all get the same training. 
 Why were you angry at Councilman Peña? 
 Peña? That's what this is about? 
 Look, Peña was a fraud, all right? 
 He talked about his compassion for veterans, but he didn't do anything when I lost my benefits. Nothing. 
 So you took revenge. 
 Yes, yes, I took revenge. I got a little pissed off. 
 What's the big deal? 
 What's the big deal? Blowing up a man's car just another day at the office? 
 What are you talking about? 
 I keyed his car, I didn't blow... 
 Wait, you're telling me that Peña's car blew up? 
 With Peña inside. 
 And you're too damn big to be keying somebody's car. Grow up. 
 So what happened after you finished keying it? 
 I didn't finish keying it. 
 I saw a security guard coming, I took off. 
 Security guard? Man, that-that community center don't have money to afford no secur... 
 Do you have a description on that guard? 
 Didi : Well, you were right. 
 No guards on duty at the community center. 
 But two people said that they saw a security guard... 
 Caucasian, average height, face shadowed from a hat. 
 That's not much to go on. 
 I did get one interesting detail: one of the witnesses said that the guard was still there when the fire department showed up. 
 Said he was just standing back and watching. 
 As in a bomber enjoying his own handiwork. 
 A criminal compelled to see the crime scene he has created. 
 And if this guy's enjoying what he's doing, how long till he does it again? 
 ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
 (explosion) 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 "You did this to yourself." 
 See anyone suspicious in the crowd? 
 No one who seemed to fit the description of our bomber. 
 And no one's reported seeing any security guards. 
 Same shotgun shell shrapnel. 
 This is our guy. 
 But two very different victims. 
 Joseph Peña, city councilman. 
 Ian Marar, city surfer slash stoner slash bongo enthusiast. 
 Captain Cole, what can you tell us about the mad bomber? 
 Where will he strike next? 
 If you had to speculate? 
 Give me minute. 
 Another bomb, another victim... 
 (phone dings) 
 Oh, great. And here's the mayor. 
 Why's the mayor's name saved as "Bunny" in your phone? 
 Okay, that's not important. Uh, let's just focus here. 
 What-what have you guys found out? 
 This is definitely our guy, so there has to be a connection between the victims. 
 But the connection is not immediately apparent. 
 Well, keep looking until it is. 
 Two targeted bomb attacks in 24 hours has the city up in arms and Bunny up my ass and these clowns just in a feeding frenzy. 
 Well... 
 ...guess there's no time like the present. 
 Wish me luck. 
 (reporters clamoring) 
 Bunny's up her ass. 
 Okay, I'll take a few questions. 
 Does the mad bomber... 
 Why would a bomber leave a note for a man who is about to die? 
 The bomb itself was all he needed to get the job done. 
 Anything he adds beyond that... a note, shotgun shells as shrapnel... makes this feel extra personal. 
 Well, "did this" is past tense. 
 And if he's referencing a past incident... 
 This is specifically about revenge. 
 Our two victims have no clear connection. 
 Maybe this past incident is the thing that connects them. 
 We may have something else connecting them. 
 They both played golf? 
 And not just that. 
 It's got the same K on it. 
 They both used the same brand of golf club. 
 Hey, you a golfer? 
 And I don't just mean that as a white man stereotype. 
 I mean, any chance you know this particular brand? 
 Mm-mm. No. 
 (scoffs) 
 Two victims with the same clubs. 
 What do you make of that? 
 Wow, you're seriously off your game. 
 Come on, now you're starting to freak me out. 
 Carter : So, you're not tired. 
 And you're not in love. 
 Sorry, Walters. Is it the apartment thing? 
 Is that stressing you out or something? 
 I'm not stressed. 
 I just feel a little off. 
 Well, you need to get on, man. 
 I mean, we got people blowing up in this town. 
 Get in the game. 
 (phone rings) 
 Detective Lee. 
 (laughing): Lee, baby. 
 What up, though? 
 Gerald, why are you calling me? 
 'Cause I found the perfect place. 
 What's up, baby? Dang, I love the way you playing with that water like that. Hey, listen, I haven't actually been to the apartments yet, but who cares, because it is a pool full of hotties over here. 
 I do not need a pool and hotties. 
 Really, ninja? 
 Don't be disrespectful, man. What do you mean you don't need a pool full of hotties? Everybody needs a pool full of hotties. You lost your mind, man? 
 I'm gonna send you poolside hot pics right now, okay? 
 Get ready for the pic... 
 (phone beeps off) 
 Hello? 
 Your cousin is very annoying. 
 (phone chiming) 
 No argument here. 
 What's he sending you? 
 Poolside hottie pics. 
 Oh, who is the...? Oh, now why he get the ladies? 
 Oh, come on, man! 
 I hate him. 
 Didi : Hey, guys. I dug into our surfer's financial records, and you will never guess what I found. 
 A million receipts for flip-flops and beef jerky? 
 And a lot of Chinese takeout, yes. 
 But I found an abnormality. 
 A really big one. 
 A year and a half ago, he inherited some commercial property. 
 Marar owned a commercial building? 
 Yeah, I know. It's a... 
 I mean, he owned for like a day. 
 He sold it immediately, and then gradually just blew through the cash. 
 On surf wax and string cheese? 
 And tequila and beer, yes. 
 But get this. 
 The property that he sold was a strip mall located outside the district where he lived and inside the district of Councilman Peña. 
 So who bought the building? 
 A big firm... Krieg Commercial. 
 Carter : Krieg? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And there it is... the golf club logo. 
 Our Special K. 
 The golf clubs were designed by Krieg Commercial? 
 I doubt it. 
 I mean, Krieg Commercial is purely a real estate firm. 
 But the owner, Hugo Krieg, does have a few other business holdings. 
 I mean, nothing related to golf clubs. 
 This one might be of interest. 
 One of the holdings was a construction demolition company. 
 Well, then he would have access to all kinds of explosive material. 
 Didi, you got Krieg's...? 
 You're extremely good at this. 
 I know. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Golf clubs with your company logo were found at both bombing sites. 
 Well, that's a little disturbing. 
 But the engraved clubs are my standard closing present. 
 I've given out dozens of sets this year alone. 
 So you gave a set to Ian Marar when you bought his strip mall? 
 Cienega Vista? Yeah. 
 That place was a mess before I stepped in. 
 I found them a new anchor, expanded the parking. 
 Now it's got CrossFit, gourmet yogurt, an artisan cheese shop. 
 Was Councilman Peña in any way connected to this property? 
 Indirectly. 
 I scratch his back when it comes to election time. 
 He scratches mine when it comes to redeveloping in his district. 
 Is that a metaphor... scratching backs? 
 No, these guys were apparently very fond of each other. 
 So the clubs you gave to Peña? 
 A thank you for helping to push the refurb plans past the opposition. 
 Uh, what kind of opposition? 
 There's always opposition. 
 Local residents concerned about noise, environmentalist, competing businesses. 
 Where did that come from? 
 No idea. 
 I walked into the office, it was sitting on my desk. 
 If Krieg got the same note... 
 
 
 
 Krieg : Wait. Wha-what's going on? 
 No, no, no, no! 
 What? What? What? What? 
 Oh, oh, don't move! 
 Stay right there and be very, very still. 
 There's a pressure-release mechanism on your chair. 
 Meaning what? 
 Meaning don't move an inch or your ass is getting blown into pieces and taking all of us with it. 
 Okay, okay, uh... 
 Detective Carter, we need a bomb squad immediately. 
 Carter, there's a timer. 
 A timer? How long? 
 Two minutes. 
 So much for the bomb squad. 
 Whoa, what do you mean?! 
 So what do we do? 
 Don't worry. 
 I know exactly what to do. 
 Do you really know exactly what to do? 
 No, I literally have zero ideas. 
 Not even one or two bad ones... you? 
 Okay, we have a pressure release mechanism, triggered by the weight of his body. 
 And the weight must remain stable or the bomb will... 
 Indy! Indy Jones, Lee! 
 Here, help me with the desk. 
 The desk, come on, come on! Help me move it out the way! 
 Whoa, what... Indy Jones? 
 Come on, uh... the plant! 
 Help me with the plant! Help me with the plant! 
 No, no, no! Bad idea! Bad idea! 
 Listen very carefully. 
 As we slide this plant into your chair, gradually replacing the weight of your body... 
 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! You're gonna Indiana Jones me here? 
 You bet your ass we are. 
 You are betting my ass, Detective. 
 You are literally betting my ass! 
 Hey, it worked in the movie. 
 No, it didn't! 
 It did for a second! 
 I've seen the movie and it worked a little bit! 
 Now shut the hell up! 
 We've only got two minutes! 
 Oh... 
 Okay, okay, easy, easy, easy. 
 Okay, we got this. 
 Oh, oh, oh, okay. 
 Easy, easy, easy. 
 Careful, careful. 
 We got it. 
 Oh, oh, oh. 
 Huh. 
 (laughs) 
 In your face, Harrison Ford! 
 (rapid beeping, all yelling) 
 (explosion, glass shattering) 
 (whimpering) 
 Anybody see anything? 
 Nothing useful. 
 How is Krieg? 
 He got thrown to the ground, took a pretty good hit to the head, but he should be okay. 
 The man we thought was our bomber was just another target, so we got nothing new to go on. 
 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 Not necessarily. 
 Be subtle about it, but does the EMT directly behind you appear a little odd? 
 It's the wrong uniform. 
 'Cause he's not a real EMT. 
 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 Hey, wait. Hold on, hold on. Let's not tip him off, all right? 
 Let's just move nice and slow, calm and nat... 
 Lee, the look on your face right now... neither calm, nor natural. 
 This is natural. 
 There's nothing natural about your natural. 
 This is my natural.

 Let me help your ass up. 
 Straighten up your tie.

 Carter :  Lee,  home is where the heart is. 
 You don't have a home, therefore, you don't know where your heart is.

 I'll tell you what. Until you get out of this slump, I'll take over as the kung fu master. 
 All right? I'll let you hold my gun, and I'll handle the chop-socky, all right? 
 Do I need to make Bruce Lee noises when I'm doing this? 
 Okay, so that's a no to the Bruce Lee noises. 
 Okay, so Krieg's at the hospital, he's well protected. 
 We got eyes all over the building in case our bomber surfaces. 
 Well, assuming he isn't after another target right now. 
 Okay, let's just deal with what we know, all right? 
 Krieg buys a rundown strip mall from Marar, right? 
 Then Councilman Peña fast-tracks the deal, then he demolishes the building. 
 Making someone very angry. 
 Find anything on preservation efforts? 
 Actually, yes. So it turns out that someone wanted that strip mall to be considered a historic landmark. 
 I mean, L.A. Heritage Society even filed a petition for it. 
 I can start looking through those names, but there's hundreds of 'em. 
 We need to move faster than that. 
 If the Heritage Society got a petition, then maybe somebody there can tell us if that petition had any particularly vocal supporters. 
 Well, vocal to the point of anger. 
 And maybe mad enough that someone stood out. 
 Didi, you got...? 
 You're always on. 
 Any chance you can give some of that to Lee? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Yeah, there were a few people upset about that strip mall, but I can't recall anyone specifically offhand. 
 So, nobody stood out as particularly passionate? 
 Like intensely, dangerously, murderously passionate? 
 Well, anyone who comes in here is passionate. I mean, it's human nature to be invested in your home and your community. 
 For some people, it's an identity. 
 I'm sorry. I wish I could be more help, but we've got the Angelino Historical Park tour tonight, and I'm running a little bit late. 
 I'm sure Angelino is a wonderful man with a lovely park, all right? 
 But there's got to be something you can remember here. 
 Any detail, big or small. 
 Take a look. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm sorry. I mean, we get hundreds of petitions each year. 
 And unfortunately, it doesn't look like this one had much of a shot at historic status. 
 Why do you say that? 
 Well, it's hard to get historic status when the historic parts of your building aren't there. 
 This property was renovated 15 years before. 
 Here. Feel free to take a look at these. 
 Maybe it'll help. 
 Thank you. 
 All right. 
 So a few people were passionate about saving this old strip mall. 
 Carter. 
 What's up? 
 Excuse me. 
 Right there.

 Does that handwriting look familiar to you? 
 Same upside down umbrella "Y." 
 Whoever owns that store is our bomber. 
 Didi, need some info. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 David Levy. 
 Born in Brooklyn, New York, 1952. 
 Our bagel-shop-owning bomber? 
 No, afraid not. 
 Born in Brooklyn, New York, 1952. 
 Died in Los Angeles just last year. 
 Any family? 
 No children, no next of kin. 
 Come on. Every time we think we got a lead, this thing blows up in our faces! 
 That was inadvertent. 
 Maybe there was a customer who was really mad that the place closed. 
 Mad enough to blow people up? 
 Those would have to be some seriously delicious bagels. 
 Let me see what these bagel shop reviews say. 
 "Bagels aren't great, but love the friendly staff, especially Troy." 
 "Great neighborhood feel. 
 Troy always makes you feel welcome." 
 "Always get amazing service, especially from..." 
 Troy. 
 The one and only. 
 Are there any photos? 
 Yeah. 
 That's him. That's our bomber.

 Cole : Okay, guys, listen up. 
 The suspect's name is Troy Novacek. 
 He trained as a chemical engineer in the Czech Republic. 
 He has successfully rigged and detonated three explosive devices in this city today, so just assume that anything in there could be rigged to explode. 
 I want you to exercise extreme caution. 
 I don't want anyone leaving here in more than one piece today, all right? 
 You two come with me. Good luck. 
 All right, ready to go. Thanks.

 Thanks for getting her started for me. 
 So far, no sign of any active explosives.

 Don't want to risk anything happening to that handsome face of yours, Chad. 
 Would you quit flirting with Chad? 
 Who are you... my mother?

 I'm coming up on unit five. 
 The door is closed. 
 Entryway is clear. 
 Be careful, Chad. 
 Chad : All right.

 I'm entering the unit.

 That's a dirty-ass apartment right there. 
 Interesting screen saver. 
 Carter : Hey, you see that? 
 It's a strip mall. 
 I got a gray backpack. 
 There's something inside. 
 Check this out. 
 Carter : Marar, Peña, Krieg. 
 His targets. 
 Are there any other photos, possible next target? 
 No, this is it. 
 The Heritage Society. 
 He must have gone to them for help for saving the shop, but they didn't come through. 
 Come on, Lee. Let's go. 
 Sergeant, get me a bomb squad, every available unit to the L.A. Heritage Society. 
 Lee, we got to get to this Heritage building. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Lee : What are you doing? 
 We're supposed to be going to the Heritage building. 
 Our bomber has been targeting people, individuals, all right? 
 Not a building, not an institution. 
 Well, then he's after the people who make up the institution. 
 "People" doesn't seem right. Everything so far has been focused, personal. 
 Let me see the image from his house. 
 Lee : Right there. 
 Zoom in for me. 
 Lee : It's Molly. 
 I'm sorry, I wish I could be more help, but we've got the Angelino Historical Park tour tonight, and I'm in a little bit of a hurry. 
 She's his next target. 
 She won't be at Heritage. 
 She had a tour. 
 Angelino Park. 
 If we know that, then so does our bomber. 
 Lee : Carter, we can't save Molly if we are dead! 
 Carter : Thanks for the information, Lee! 
 What, they don't do it like that in Hong Kong? 
 There's no answer at the Heritage Society, and Molly's not picking up her phone. 
 Didi, get word to Cole and to Bomb Squad that we're heading to Angelino Park, 'cause that's where our bomber is. 
 Molly : And here we have the De Rosa House built in 1887 by Randall Stringer, a land speculator and real estate developer. 
 If you follow me inside, we'll go take a look. 
 So as you can see, the house is just magnificent. 
 (laughs) 
 Everyone at Heritage worked really hard to save it. 
 Novacek : What made this worth saving, hmm? 
 I'm sorry? I'm not... sure I understand. 
 I know you don't. 
 You never did. 
 (people murmuring quietly) 
 So the bomb squad is on their way, but they're coming from the opposite side of town. 
 Best case scenario, they're there in 20 minutes. 
 Carter : That's 18 minutes too late. 
 You said file petition. 
 I did! 
 You said get signatures! 
 I did! 
 You said you would help. 
 (people murmuring nervously) 
 I-I always do my best to help and I'm always sorry... 
 You're not sorry! 
 (panicked chattering) 
 But you will be. 
 (tires screech) 
 Squad's coming late to the party. 
 Looks like it's on us. 
 (panicked chattering) 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 Ow! Please, I tried... 
 Liar! 
 David's shop never mattered! 
 You didn't try! 
 You didn't care! 
 Easy, easy, Troy. 
 Hey, hey, hey! Easy. 
 This isn't on her. 
 Think about David. 
 This is all for David. 
 He gave me a chance when nobody else would. 
 Where I come from, I was chemical engineer. 
 Here, I couldn't get work as a janitor! 
 That shop, it was my... 
 Lee : Home. 
 When you came to this country, you left behind the only home you'd ever known. 
 And you had no idea how hard it would be to find a place where you felt like you belonged. 
 But I did. 
 And it was taken away from you. 
 I can only imagine how painful that must've been. 
 It's not easy to feel displaced. 
 A man without a home is not free to be himself. 
 What do you know? 
 I know what it's like to lose a family. 
 To lose a home. 
 To feel lost, but this is not the way it has to end. 
 It's too late. 
 (quietly): No... 
 This is the only way it can end. 
 (grunts) 
 (shouts) 
 (grunting) 
 Carter, there's a timer! Help Molly! 
 (grunting) 
 (panicked shouting, screaming) 
 Move! Move! Everybody get out of the way! Come on! 
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! 
 (grunting) 
 All right, all right. Okay. 
 (whimpering) 
 All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. 
 Okay. Okay. Uh... Calm down! 
 Get it off! Get it off! 
 Calm down! Calm down! 
 This is not a problem. 
 I know all about bomb vests. 
 No, you don't. 
 Okay, no, I don't. But you're gonna be fine. I'm a fast learner. 
 Get it off! Please! 
 Okay. Oh. Oh, one minute and 35 seconds. 
 One minute and 35 seconds! 
 Please, Officer, get it off! 
 Okay, okay. 
 (grunting) 
 Get it off! Get it off! 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 (gasping) 
 All right. Okay. All right. 
 (gasping) 
 (squealing) 
 Oh, hot potato, hot potato, hot potato, hot potato, hot potato. 
 (grunting) 
 Hot potato, hot potato, hot potato, hot potato, hot potato. 
 I don't want to die! 
 (grunts) 
 (grunts)

 I feared the worst. 
 Fortunately, Carter was able to dispose of the bomb before it detonated. 
 There are plenty of thrilling details I could share, but for now, let's just say I was... 
 ...on. 
 So, you actually pulled a live bomb vest off that woman? 
 Like I said... 
 ...on. My man over here was feeling a little... off, so I stepped up. 
 Lifted that vest right on off. 
 You do realize how incredibly stupid that was, right? 
 Sorry, what? 
 Even the slightest, little, tiny nudge could've triggered that thing and blown you both to pieces. 
 Yeah. Well, you... well, you know, when a man is truly on... 
 Carter, you should be dead. 
 I like to think that Detective Carter knew what he was doing. 
 He followed his instincts and saved the day. 
 All right, you know what, that is a very nice thought, Lee, but, no, no, his instincts were wrong and Carter should be dead. 
 (phone rings) 
 Cole. 
 No, no, I do not want to comment on the arrest of Doctor Boom. And who the hell gave you this number? 
 Hey, yo, Ma, let me get your Instagram. 
 Lee! (chuckles) Hey, man. 
 You might as well call me the Papa John's of real estate pimpin' because I deliver. 
 All right, so I was thinking, right... 
 What's wrong with him? 
 He just found out he's supposed to be dead. 
 He's a-a little off. 
 Oh, that's a shame. 
 Anyway, listen, I was like, "What does my main man Lee need in a pad, right? 
 "What does my favorite Korean... 
 Chinese. 
 Chinese detective need most?" 
 And the answer and your new pad is right this way. Come on, let's go. 
 And bring your little sad puppy with you. 
 (grunts) 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 Be my guest. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Whew! Something smells good. 
 I thought Gerald said he had a place. 
 Why are we at Didi's? 
 I think he just got hungry and forgot where he was taking us. 
 Not so. 
 Though this dinner does smell delightful. 
 Corn soufflé! 
 (sniffs) Ah,  magnifique... 
 Gerald! 
 What? 
 Focus. 
 Oh. Lee does not need a pad. 
 Lee needs a home. 
 Allow me to be the first to say, Detective Lee, welcome home, baby. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Lee said it himself, he said he wanted a place that made him feel like he was at home. 
 And I thought to myself, "What's the homiest crib I know in L.A.?" And I called Didi. 
 I mean, I have the extra guest room, Lee. 
 There is plenty of space. 
 Well, that's very kind of you, but I-I couldn't put you through all that trouble. 
 Trouble? Have you seen what I deal with in this house? 
 You are not trouble. This right here, trouble. 
 Lee... I would be absolutely honored to have you. 
 Well, then I'd be honored to accept. 
 (chuckles) 
 Aw, look at that. Man's got a home and now he's back to his old self. 
 Gonna be beating up people in no time. Praise God. 
 (chuckles) 
 Here, let me show you where you'll be. 
 Gerald : Oh, that's beautiful, cuz. 
 Here you go. You have this all to yourself. 
 It's quite nice. 
 Hey, I'm just happy I could've been of some assistance. 
 If I can get that finder's fee! (chuckles) 
 I don't think you get a finder's fee for finding Didi's house. 
 Why not? I found it. 
 We already knew it was here. 
 And now you really know it's here, more so, because I found it. 
 Welcome home. 
 Carter : You're dumb as hell. 
 You ain't gettin' no commission. 
 Spell "commission." Spell it. 
 Spell "commission." 
 You spell it! 
 I don't know how to spell it. 
 Gerald : I know you don't know how to spell it. I don't know how to spell it either. That's what we got iPhones for.
