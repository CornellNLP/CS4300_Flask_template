 My name is Clary and I'm a Shadowhunter, 
 born to protect mankind from demons. 
 A never-ending battle against evil, 
 but I know who I can count on. 
 Simon, my oldest friend. A vampire. 
 Magnus, a warlock from Brooklyn. 
 Luke, a werewolf pack leader and New York City cop, 
 and Jace, Izzy and Alec, 
 three of the bravest Shadowhunters alive. 
 Alone, we're strong. 
 Together, we are unstoppable. 
 Previously on  Shadowhunters... 
 ALEC: There's a greater demon on the loose. 
 MAGNUS: Azazel. 
 My name is Sebastian. 
 RAPHAEL: You're a daylighter. 
 There's a name for it? 
 RAPHAEL: I can be your friend. 
 But not if you insist on keeping things from me. 
 I told you everything I know. 
 I hope so. 
 VALENTINE: If you were smart,     you'll summon Azazel with your warlock friend     and use me as a bait. 
 (RUSHING AIR) 
 (GROANING) 
 Stupid warlock. 
 Now a present for you, my dear Valentine. 
 Please! 
 Please! 
 Guards! 
 Somebody! 
 I am not Valentine, I am Magnus Bane! 
 Valentine has escaped! 
 Please, somebody! 
 Somebody! 
 (LABOURED BREATHING) 
 (HIGH-PITCHED SOUND) 
 God! 
 (GLASS SHATTERING) 
 (BOTTLES CLINKING) 
 Looking for a way to switch yourself back? 
 You did this to me! 
 You trapped me inside of a filthy warlock! 
 I wanted to give you incentive. 
 You want freedom as a Shadowhunter? 
 Give me the Mortal Cup. 
 You'll have to switch me back first. 
 The Cup is in a place     where any demon-blooded intruder     will be killed on sight. 
 I have great faith in your ability     to defy the odds. 
 I don't bargain with demons.

 SIMON: So tell me... 
 CLARY: Hmm? 
 SIMON: ...do you really like the bed better than the canoe? 
 (CLARY SIGHING) 
 No. 
 Mmhmm. 
 I much prefer waking up with my hair smelling like algae. 
 See? 
 I knew that. 
 I love that smell. 
 (CLARY GIGGLING) 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 It reminds me of the time that Luke took us out on the lake. 
 SIMON CHUCKLING: You fell in. 
 Fell in?! 
 You were so mad! 
 Well, I was mad because you stood up and tipped us over! 
 Nah, that doesn't sound like me. 
 OK. 
 I don't remember that.

 (KAYAKS KNOCKING) 
 Thank you. 
 Looks like Azazel's headed south. 
 We just recovered four dead mundanes      with his signature M.O. 
 OK. 
 Let's go. 
 To catch a greater demon      you summoned to the Institute,      defying all protocol and common sense? 
 Don't put this all on Jace. 
 I had a part in this, too. 
 JACE: Look,      if you want to bench your best fighter      with a greater demon on the loose, I'm happy to oblige. 
 No. 
 First we vanquish Azazel. 
 Then I'll decide what to do with you. 
 Go. 
 I'll catch up. 
 - (CARS HONKING) 
 - ISABELLE: Good morning. 
 SEBASTIAN: Did you sleep well? 
 ISABELLE SIGHING: Thank you for giving up your bed. 
 How are you feeling? 
 The strongest I've been in a long time. 
 Good. 
 You know...      ... 
 not many people will take in a stranger and be so generous. 
 Well... 
 you're welcome to stay as long as you need. 
 That's very kind... 
 but I need to get back to the Institute. 
 Hmm. 
 You should come with me. 
 Uh... thanks, but, um... 
 You know, I've ...I've kind of gotten used to being on my own. 
 So... 
 I'd gotten used to vampire venom. 
 Sometimes change is good. 
 ALEC: Azazel's attacks go as far south      as the meat-packing district. 
 And then the trail goes cold. 
 JACE: It's no use just tracking the dead bodies. 
 With his ability to dematerialize,      he could be anywhere. 
 ISABELLE: Maybe we can help. 
 Izzy! We've been so worried about you. 
 Where have you been? 
 Looking for Azazel. 
 This is Sebastian Verlac, from the London Institute. 
 When the demon came after me,      Sebastian saved my life. 
 Oh, I simply lent a hand. 
 Sebastian's an expert on all things Azazel. 
 When I studied abroad at the Paris Institute,      I specialized in greater demons. 
 Thanks for saving my sister. 
 I'm Alec. 
 Hey. 
 Yeah, thank you. 
 I'm Jace. 
 The great warrior in the flesh. 
 Your reputation precedes you. 
 As does yours. 
 You must be Clary. 
 Valentine's daughter. 
 Yeah. 
 Don't hold it against me. 
 Well, we don't choose our parents. 
 JACE: So tell us about Azazel. 
 How do we take him down? 
 The only way to banish him is to puncture his demonic core. 
 In corporeal form, it's between the T  and T  vertebrae,      but it's not that simple. 
 The core is about the size of a pea. 
 Oh, so the entry point's right below his sternum? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 If I can get close enough, I can kill him. 
 You wouldn't have enough velocity,      and even if you did, the defeat's only temporary. 
 The nasty buggers always find a way      to break out of their realm and come back. 
 Thank you for the intel. 
 We'll take it from here. 
 If I can, I'd like to help. 
 We appreciate that,      but you don't have clearance to go on mission. 
 Not this Institute. 
 Alec, you can't be serious. 
 JACE: Hey, Alec. 
 Look. 
 He clearly knows more than us about Azazel. 
 We could use all the help we could get. 
 SEBASTIAN: Now, as far as tracking is      concerned, we should really think about... 
 We have a very capable warlock for that. 
 You do what you want. 
 I'm gonna work with Magnus. 
 ISABELLE: Alec, stop! 
 Stop! 
 What's your problem? 
 Sebastian Verlac shows up out of the blue and saves you? 
 What are you trying to say? 
 Alec, you did everything you could to help me. 
 And I love you for that. 
 But don't treat Sebastian like the enemy      just because he was able to help me. 
 (SEAGULL CRYING) 
 (RUSHING AIR) 
 (CLAPPING) 
 You hid the Cup in this... other realm,      and now you don't know how to portal there? 
 I'm not a goddamn warlock. 
 I don't know what I'm doing. 
 If you want to create a portal, let's get a real one. 
 So you can use 'em to switch you back and escape this mess? 
 I don't think so. 
 And once I give you the Cup? 
 I'll reward your kindness by delivering you      into a body that you deserve. 
 Not one that's not locked up in a Shadowhunter's prison. 
 (RINGING) 
 Get rid of him. 
 (RINGING) 
 Hey, Alec. 
 Hey. 
 Look, I know you had a rough night,      but, um... 
 I need your help tracking Azazel. 
 I wish I could help,      but I'm busy with a client. 
 Are you OK? 
 You sound strange. 
 I had a rough night. 
 Look, I need to get back to my client. 
 If you need a warlock, call Dorothea.

 (OMINOUS MUSIC) 
 (KNOCKING) 
 ALEC: Magnus, you there? 
 Hello. 
 What's going on? 
 Nothing. 
 Why? 
 Well, it's just... 
 you were acting strange on the phone just now. 
 Terse. 
 I told you. 
 I'm busy. 
 Right. 
 It's just, uh... 
 You've never refused to help me      when I need it, and I just...      ... 
 Magnus. 
 What's wrong? 
 Hey... 
 talk to me. 
 (RUSHING AIR) 
 Did I not tell you to get rid of him?

 (MAGNUS SIGHS) 
 Are you OK? 
 MAGNUS BREATHING HEAVILY: Fine. 
 Why'd you tell me to stop? 
 I was afraid something terrible would happen. 
 Something that couldn't be undone. 
 Hey. 
 You're OK. 
 (DRAMATIC MUSIC) 
 - You wanted to see us? 
 - Yes. 
 I told you I would decide what was next for you      once Azazel was vanquished, so here we are. 
 You can do whatever you want with me,      but leave Clary out of this. 
 Well, that's not possible. 
 The Clave wants to have you both tested      to get a greater understanding      of your unique angel-blood abilities. 
 No,      we'll pass on being lab rats. 
 No, Jace. 
 I want to do this. 
 I haven't been able to use my runes      since we summoned Azazel. 
 I... 
 I wanna understand why. 
 Thank you, Ms. 
 Morgenstern. 
 Your willingness to put your own comfort aside      for the greater good is to be commended. 
 You would do well to follow her example. 
 I'm not a follower. 
 I'll do the testing on my own. 
 When do we start? 
 Clary, you don't know the Clave like I do. 
 First they'll just want you doing      circus tricks. 
 The next thing you know,      you'll be monitored   - . 
 I'll do whatever it takes. 
 Jace, it's OK if you don't want to do this,      but... drawing those runes... 
 for the first time,      I felt like there was a reason I became a Shadowhunter. 
 I need to get them back. 
 I guess it's your lucky day. 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Darling. 
 What took you so long? 
 Sorry. 
 After all the abuse Valentine put me through... 
 DOT SIGHING: I'm still not strong enough to create portals. 
 You know, you really should let go of your anger. 
 I'd hate to see something bad happen to you because of it. 
 The way you said that, you sounded just like... 
 MAGNUS SCOFFING: Look,      I need your help. 
 Last night I got blasted by a greater demon. 
 Oh my god. 
 Magnus, no wonder you seem a bit off. 
 The worst part is, it's like it short-circuited my memory. 
 I can't access my magic. 
 I've never heard of such a thing. 
 Me neither. 
 I need you to teach me. 
 OK.

 What? 
 You got a tan. 
 Looks nice. 
 - It does? 
 - (ISABELLE chuckling) 
 Back to Raphael. 
 How can I help? 
 So... 
 I heard you guys were kind of seeing each other,      and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind helping me out,      doing that thing you're really good at,      you know, making a man bend to your every will. 
 - (SIGHING) 
 - But look, if you      don't want to get involved. 
 - No sweat. 
 I get it. 
 - No, no. 
 It's... 
 ... 
 it's not that. 
 It's...      ... 
 when I got injured by that demon,      Aldertree gave me some Yin-Fen to regain my strength. 
 (TRICKLING WATER) 
 But things got out of control. 
 The reason why I was seeing Raphael... 
 Izzy, what is it? 
 I became addicted to vampire venom. 
 Oh. 
 I... 
 I had... 
 I had no idea. 
 - Are you... 
 - I'm... 
 I'm OK. 
 (TRICKLING WATER) 
 Actually, I'm... 
 I'm great. 
 - Good. 
 OK. 
 Good. 
 - Yeah. 
 Cause... 
 you know, with my mom... 
 it's a lot of ups and downs. 
 And I'm guessing there's not really a... 
 -Step program at the Institute for Shadowhunters. 
 Um... 
 I know a lot of really good groups... 
 Simon, I'm not a mundane. 
 I don't do groups. 
 But I do fix Downworlder problems. 
 - Come on. 
 - No. 
 Look, I'm... 
 I'm good. 
 I know that staying clean      means staying away from Raphael. 
 ISABELLE SIGHING: Who said anything      about going near Raphael? 
 (TRICKLING WATER)

 I know you're listening! 
 Please! 
 I'm not Valentine! 
 I'm Magnus Bane!

 You have to listen to me... 
 No, you listen to me! 
 This sick game of yours is over! 
 It's not a game. 
 I know it sounds crazy, but I'm not Valentine. 
 I am Magnus. 
 Azazel switched us with a curse. 
 Unum ad Unum. 
 You're insane. 
 You gave me that Omamori charm      that I carry with me every day. 
 It was after our night in Tokyo. 
 We were at the Palace Hotel. 
 And we kissed on the terrace. 
 And then you... 
 Stop! 
 - And then you took me in... 
 - STOP! 
 How do you know these things? 
 Because... 
 it's me, Alexander. 
 The day of Valentine's massacre, you told me that you loved me. 
 So if you love me, please. 
 Please, you have to believe me. 
 Alexander... 
 Just... 
 stop.

 Um, this is gonna sound crazy. 
 I was just with Valentine, and he says that he's Magnus,      that Azazel switched them with some kind of a demonic curse. 
 - What? 
 - I know. 
 It's hard to believe, but it's just that... 
 he knew things that only Magnus could know. 
 - Like, intimate details. 
 - OK. 
 Well, he could have had a warlock steal your memories. 
 No, that's not possible. 
 I would have noticed. 
 OK, well... 
 Well, just remember that this is Valentine. 
 He's always    steps ahead of us. 
 He's always planning his next move. 
 Alec, just trust me. 
 You don't wanna fall for his lies. 
 Alexander?

 After your capture, the Clave hired me to create wards      to block Downworlder powers      from being used in this cellblock. 
 Not only can't you break me out,      but your cloaking spell won't work here.

 Your rune ability still causing you trouble? 
 You know. 
 Yeah, it's, um... 
 it's kind of the hot topic around here. 
 You know all this stuff about Azazel. 
 I was wondering... 
 my powers stopped working      when I tried to use them against him. 
 Is it possible he... 
 somehow took them? 
 (SIGHING) 
 Stealing angelic power is      something that even a greater demon can't do. 
 So much for simple answers. 
 Look, it, um... 
 It might be simpler than you think. 
 We are trained so fiercely to believe      that... 
 emotions cloud our judgment. 
 But... 
 I believe that emotions give us power. 
 And when we suppress them,      we are all the weaker for it. 
 Perhaps that's the problem. 
 My mother just died, but... 
 I... 
 I feel the pain of that every day. 
 I... 
 couldn't shut that out if I tried. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 And I heard Jace just found out that he's not Valentine's son. 
 What does that have to do with anything? 
 Well, think about it. 
 You... 
 your father's never really been your father. 
 You... 
 you've just lost your mother. 
 And the brother that you thought you had isn't your brother. 
 Jace. 
 Right before my runes stopped working, that's when he told me. 
 That's what you're blocking out. 
 (SIGHING) 
 The pain of losing the one last person      you thought was family. 
 You need to let that in, Clary. 
 Believe me, I have.

 No. 
 No.

 your darkness will come. 
 (SIGHING) 
 What did you just say? 
 I'm repeating your words back to you. 
 (SIGHING) 
 MAGNUS: You remember the fire message you sent to me      the night Stephen died. 
 The good news is, in exchange for my freedom,      you can save your pure angel-blooded warrior. 
 I don't make deals with the devil. 
 You chose the wrong bait. 
 For all she cares, you could slaughter me right now. 
 MAGNUS: I don't think so. 
 Imogen wouldn't dare slaughter her grandson. 
 JACE: After all your lies, you expect me      to believe I'm a Herondale? 
 Stephen Herondale was your father... 
 and his wife Céline was your mother. 
 You ever think about poor Céline? 
 Nine months pregnant when she took her own life. 
 Her dead body ravaged by werewolves,      her unborn son eaten alive. 
 Or was he? 
 You didn't... 
 The Clave took so much from me. 
 So I took something in return. 
 MAGNUS: But I'm sure you want further proof. 
 HERONDALE: My family ring. 
 Where did you get that? 
 Off Céline's very hand. 
 You have one hour to meet my demands,      or your grandson dies.

 Sebastian, this isn't working. 
 You wanted a brother so badly,      because then at least you'd have someone to share in the pain.
