 We need blood. 
 So I've heard. 
 Human blood. 
 Everything's out of control. 
 We were fools to believe Valentine was dead. 
 Jace :  Previously on  Shadowhunters... 
 My sister wants you to be her defense attorney. 
 For the right price. 
 Name it. 
 You. 
 Jace :  Clary, if you don't help us, no one survives. Do you understand? 
 Clary :  Mom, please, wake up. 
 You're out of order. 
 This whole thing is out of order. 
 I am your father, Clary. And Jace's. 
 They're brother and sister. 
 That means they can't... 
 You'll be lonely all your life. Neither of you deserve it. 
 And I don't either. 
 Bring the flowers out to the wedding tent. 
 Put the lilies up on the dais, and lay the rose petals at the entrance. 
 Isabelle, which color do you like better? 
 It's for the curtains adorning the wedding tent. 
 Hmm. 
 The cobalt blue. It's elegant, masculine... very Alec. 
 woman : I'll put the cobalt blue out right away. 
 How are we supposed to get any work done with all this going on? 
 [sighs] We haven't had a wedding here in years. 
 People are allowed to be excited. 
 We need to focus. 
 Have you narrowed down the list of warlocks more powerful than Magnus Bane? 
 [sighs] 
 I've got it down to 20. 
 But it's gonna be hard to figure out which one cast that spell on Jocelyn. 
 I don't care how tough it is, we've gotta find him. 
 Back at Renwick's, I let Valentine go. 
 I won't make that mistake again. 
 We gotta wake up Jocelyn, in case she heard anything about his plan. 
 Have you spoken to Alec? 
 He's probably busy, what with wedding plans and all. 
 And I don't need to talk to anyone. 
 Let's just stick to the mission, okay? 
 She looks so peaceful now. 
 I just wish I knew how to reach her. 
 She's gonna be fine. 
 I'm sorry, Clary. 
 We should have told you everything before this got... 
 Luke, we can hash all that out when we wake Mom up. 
 The important thing now is that we have her back. 
 I'm looking for Lydia. 
 Have you seen her? 
 I don't mean to interrupt your...  
 No, stay for a minute. 
 I gotta get back to the station. 
 Call me if anything changes? 
 Yeah. 
 [sighs] 
 So, how is she? 
 The same, I guess. 
 [inhales deeply] 
 Alec, I know you and I don't always see eye to eye on things... 
 Actually, we never see eye to eye on anything, but I do want to thank you for everything you've done to get my mom back. 
 Actually I... 
 I should thank you. 
 I don't know what would have happened to Isabelle after the trial if you hadn't returned the Cup. 
 You saved my sister, so thank you. 
 [inhales deeply] 
 Yeah, my whole world turned upside down, but, um, you and I thanking each other... [chuckles softly] ... that's... that's too much. [Chuckles] 
 [scoffs] Yeah. 
 [cell phone vibrating] 
 [sighs] 
 Magnus needs to speak with me. 
 He might have some information about how to wake your mother up or... stop Valentine. It's important. 
 Mmm. Yeah. 
 Hello... Magnus? 
 You said you needed to talk to me. 
 Magnus : Nice to see you, Alec. 
 I wasn't sure if you'd come. 
 You know how I hate to drink alone. [Chuckles] 
 I didn't come here to drink. 
 [sighs] Do you have any information... 
 On the warlock who cast a spell on Jocelyn? 
 I'm looking into it. But... we never really finished our conversation after Izzy's trial. 
 About your wedding? 
 There's no conversation to be had. 
 I'm getting married. 
 You and I, we understand marriage very differently. 
 I'm a Shadowhunter. 
 This is about family, and tradition, honor... 
 Honor? 
 Where's the honor in living a lie? 
 What are you talking about? 
 What about love? 
 Even Shadowhunters fall in love, Alec. 
 Just tell me you're in love with Lydia, and I'll stop. 
 I don't know. 
 Why do you keep pushing? 
 [stammering] 
 You're confusing me. 
 Confusion is part of it. 
 That's how you find out if something's there. 
 Emotions are never black and white. 
 They're more like symptoms. 
 You lose your breath every time they enter a room. 
 [inhales deeply] 
 [fingers snapping] 
 [exhales] 
 Your heart beats faster when they walk by. 
 Your skin tingles when they stand close enough to feel their breath. 
 [exhales] 
 [sighs] 
 I know you feel what I feel, Alec. 
 [scoffs] 
 You don't have any clue what I feel... so back off. 
 This is all just a game to you, isn't it? 
 You flirt, you laugh, you use magic, but at the end of the day, what do you risk? 
 Even if I did feel something for you... you want me to give up my life for you? 
 I have to do what's right for me. 
 I could lose my family, my career, everything! 
 You just don't get it. 
 You have a choice to make. 
 I will not ask again. 
 [ringing] 
 Hey, Clary. What's goin' on? 
 I just, uh, needed to hear your voice. 
 Are you okay? You sound upset. 
 Yeah, I'm fine. Just...   things are kind of weird with Jace right now, but we'll work it out. 
 So how's your mom? 
 I mean, I can't believe you actually rescued her. 
 We still have to wake her up, but at least she's away from Valentine. 
 When can I see her? 
 How about tomorrow night? She's here at the infirmary. 
 Plus, it's Alec's wedding, so... 
 [chuckles] I'd love if you'd come as my date. 
 Really? 
 I... [stammers] See, I just assumed you'd want to go with Jace. 
 That's, uh... [sighs] not really in the cards right now. 
 Besides, you are the person I'm closest to in the world. 
 Please come. 
 I'd love to. 
 Um... [clears throat] 
 But I might be a little bit late, you know, with the sun and all. [Chuckles] 
 You are the best. 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Yeah. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 [Jace sighs] 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 You just come from training? 
 Yeah. I'm, uh, workin' on my right hook. 
 Good. That's a good punch. 
 Yeah. I'm, uh, I'm workin' on it. 
 While this conversation is no doubt scintillating, remind me why we couldn't do this at my place? 
 At least there we'd have cocktails. 
 It's 9:00 in the morning. 
 Oh, it's happy hour somewhere, my dear. 
 Jace : We invited you here, Magnus, because Hodge can't leave the Institute. 
 He's an important part of this mission. 
 Well, then, where is our tardy little tutor? 
 There are certain individuals that I'd like to avoid, so let's make this quick. 
 Hodge : Pardon the delay, Magnus. 
 I was following up on a lead. 
 Now, we've narrowed down our list of warlocks to these three. 
 Why is Ragnor Fell up there? He's not more powerful than I am. 
 Well, some would disagree. He is older than you. 
 Certainly not wiser. 
 Who is Ragnor Fell? 
 Jace : The former High Warlock of London. 
 And one of my oldest friends. 
 Very prickly, likes to keep to himself. 
 Okay, look. We just need to figure out which one of these warlocks had enough access to Jocelyn that they could create the potion for her without anyone discovering what they'd done. 
 By the early '90s, Ragnor was a professor at the Shadowhunter Academy in Idris. 
 Isn't that when my mother lived there? 
 Could he have made the potion for her? 
 The little bugger! 
 That's why he hasn't responded to my fire message. 
 Ever since Valentine began hunting warlocks, Ragnor's been holed up in his secret country house just outside of London. 
 For all I know, Ragnor suspected my fire message was a ploy by Valentine to lure him out of hiding. 
 We'll have to confront him face-to-face. 
 You're going on this mission? 
 Magnus : Of course! 
 I'm the only one Ragnor trusts. 
 Besides, I've played my last hand here. 
 Even I know when to fold. 
 Magnus, I didn't know you were here. 
 That was the point. 
 Lydia : We're just on our way to greet a few representatives of the Clave who arrived early for tomorrow's wedding. 
 How long are you staying? 
 What's going on here? Nobody told me about a meeting. 
 Magnus figured out that Ragnor Fell is the warlock who can wake my mom. 
 We're just bringing him back to the Institute. 
 How can I help? 
 We're just recovering a warlock, Alec. We got this covered. 
 Besides, you have emissaries from the Clave to meet. 
 You don't want to tarnish your family's perfectly-crafted image now, do you? 
 [inhales sharply] Again, lovely seeing you, Magnus. 
 [chuckles softly] 
 [Jace sighs] 
 Get ready. We leave in an hour. 
 Jace. 
 Jace, slow down. We need to talk about this. 
 Talk about what? We're good, okay? 
 No, we're not. At least... I'm not. 
 We need to talk about what Valentine said about us. 
 Look, I don't want to talk about it. 
 It happened. I feel weird right now. 
 I get it. I feel the same way, okay? But... [inhales deeply] 
 Look, we didn't know, all right? It's not our fault. 
 [sighs] I can't do this right now. I'm sorry. 
 Now that the Clave has control of the Mortal Cup, thanks to your lovely bride to be, Mom and Dad can come home now. They arrive tonight. 
 I heard. 
 Max is staying with his tutors in Idris. It's safer there. 
 Now with all the dignitaries arriving for the wedding, Mom must be beside herself. 
 This wedding is becoming more of a headache than I had planned. 
 Alec, you don't have to go through with this if you don't want to. 
 It's what I want. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 No big argument from you? 
 You stood by me through my trial, and now I'm standing by you, big brother. 
 And... I'm throwing you a bachelor party. 
 A what? 
 A bachelor party. 
 I don't need a bachelor party. 
 No one needs a bachelor party, but I'm throwing you one anyways. 
 Actually, Jace should be the one throwing it, but considering everything he must be going through with Clary... 
 I don't wanna ask him to do anything. 
 You know what I mean? 
 I do. 
 Sisters can really drive you nuts sometimes. 
 [sighs] 
 Ragnor's house is just across these fields. 
 Let's make this quick. 
 We'll talk to Ragnor, then Portal him back to the Institute before anyone knows we're gone. 
 So... brother and sister, huh? 
 I don't wanna talk about it. 
 What, so we're just gonna be work buddies now? 
 All about the mission, and totally ignore the huge bomb that just dropped on us. 
 Yeah, sounds like a plan. 
 [Sighs] 
 What do you want me to say, Clary? 
 That I was attracted to my sister? 
 Point of fact, brother and sisters are often attracted to each other. 
 I once knew this one couple in ancient Egypt... 
 Magnus, not helping. 
 Maybe this will all make sense when we wake up Jocelyn. 
 Since she is Jace's mother as well, perhaps...  
 Don't say that again. 
 Maryse is my mother. 
 [Clary sighs] 
 At best, Jocelyn is the woman who abandoned me. 
 Clary : Hey, that is not true. 
 My mother would never abandon her son. She thought you were dead. 
 Or maybe she just didn't want me. 
 You don't know her, Jace. 
 That's right, Clary, I don't. 
 Do you? 
 I'm sorry I asked! 
 I came with you to escape my relationship drama, not get a front row seat to yours. 
 What was that? 
 Nice try, Jace. 
 You're not getting out of this conversation that easily. 
 Look out! 
 [Clary gasping] 
 Ragnor put up wards to protect his lair. 
 Why is the fire green? 
 It's a wall of fire that only the pure of heart and intention can pass through. 
 Are you ready? 
 Jace? [Whooshing] 
 Magnus? 
 Where are you? 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [energy pulsating] 
 Ragnor Fell. 
 Ragnor? 
 Ragnor? 
 Hello? 
 Is anybody home? 
 I need your help. 
 Ragnor, I know you're here. 
 I just need to find my friends. 
 [clicking] 
 Nice try, Ragnor. 
 [grunts] 
 Well done... Clary Fairchild. 
 I've been expecting you. You have Jocelyn's talent, I see. 
 Only a true artist would notice the subtle changes in my eyes. 
 Yes, I know. 
 I need to work on not moving my eyes, you don't need to remind me. 
 You knew my mom? 
 So you made the potion that put her to sleep? 
 At her request, yes. 
 And I knew it was only a matter of time before you came to me looking for the antidote. 
 Please, sit. 
 My friends, Jace Wayland and Magnus Bane. 
 They were with me, but I lost them in the fire. 
 Let me do this my way! Your friends, are they true? 
 Magnus said he's known you for centuries. 
 He sent you a fire message. 
 This is not an act. It is not an act! It is essential. 
 Okay, what is your deal? 
 My friends are missing and if you can't help me, I'll find someone who can. 
 What is it worth to you? 
 You find my friends and wake my mother... 
 I'll give you anything. 
 That's what I wanted to hear. 
 [fingers snapping] 
 [gasps] 
 Magnus sighs : Honestly, Ragnor, was that nonsense necessary? 
 Of course. She offered me anything. 
 You were only up to a timeshare of your flat in Paris. 
 Yawn. 
 All right, enough with the warlock games. 
 Can you really wake my mother? 
 Not without the  Book of the White. 
 What is the  Book of the White? 
 Magnus : It's an ancient book of warlock magic containing spells more powerful than... [chuckles] most warlocks could ever imagine. 
 I possessed the book when your mother came to me, and I used its contents to create the potion. 
 Regrettably, I no longer have the book. 
 I asked Jocelyn to hide it that Valentine might never find it. 
 Ragnor, please, I have to get my mom back. 
 Is there any way to get the  Book of the White? 
 Possibly. I may have something that can help us. 
 Won't be but a moment. 
 What do we do if he can't find the book? 
 We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. 
 It's a bit drab, isn't it? 
 [demon roaring] 
 [Ragnor screams] 
 [gasps] Ragnor! 
 Shax demon. 
 [Ragnor gasping] 
 Creature took me... by surprise. 
 How could a Shax demon get past Ragnor's wards? 
 It must have followed us. 
 Jumped through when the fire wall reset. 
 Be still, my little dear cabbage. [Gasping] 
 Your wounds are deep. 
 Hold on, please. 
 [gasping] 
 [softly] No, no, no. 
 [Jace sighs] 
 For centuries, this man knew me better than anyone. 
 Magnus, I'm so sorry. 
 We have to leave, now. 
 We can't. Not until we find whatever it is Ragnor said could help us locate the  Book of the White. 
 It's too dangerous. 
 If one Shax demon found us, you can bet there are more on the way. 
 We have to try! 
 We don't have time to scour through mountains of Ragnor's stuff. 
 [inhales deeply] [fingers snapping] 
 [energy pulsating] 
 Get back to the Institute. 
 I'll transport everything back to my place, and find what you need. 
 Now, leave me to take care of my friend. 
 Clary : Magnus, I am...  
 Go! 
 [sighs] 
 Jace, you're coming to Alec's bachelor party, right? 
 No. He doesn't want me there, and I'm swamped. 
 You two seriously haven't worked things out yet? 
 There's nothing to work out. If he wants to talk, we'll talk. 
 He's your  parabatai. 
 We have more important things going on than a bachelor party. 
 Come with me. 
 We have a mole in the Institute. 
 We were attacked by a Shax demon when we went to see Ragnor Fell. 
 The attack couldn't have been coincidence. 
 Valentine must have been tracking us. 
 You don't think someone from the Institute told Valentine where you were going. 
 There's no other explanation. 
 No one here would betray us like that. 
 This is our family. 
 Magnus figured out that Ragnor Fell is the warlock who can wake my mom. 
 We're bringing him back to the Institute. 
 Not everyone's family yet. 
 I swear, if Lydia is the leak, I'm gonna...  
 Slow down. 
 We don't know if she did anything yet. 
 And wrongfully accusing someone of a crime is dangerous. 
 Trust me, I've been through it. 
 Lydia was right there when we were talking about Ragnor Fell. 
 If she's not gonna admit what she did, I'm gonna make her admit it. 
 Jace, stop. You are too worked up to talk to anyone right now. 
 Especially not an important envoy from the Clave. 
 Let me talk to Lydia. If you accuse Alec's fiancée of treason, you will ruin whatever relationship you have left with him. 
 Clary's right, Jace. If Lydia did this, she might not be so defensive with Clary. 
 She might let her guard down. 
 Slip up. 
 Fine. 
 But I wanna know everything she says. 
 
 
 
 It's perfect. I love it. 
 I'm so glad. Let me know if you need anything else. 
 Your dress is stunning. 
 Thank you. 
 I feel more nervous wearing that dress than I ever have on the battlefield. 
 I think that's pretty normal. 
 [inhales] Lydia, I need to talk to you about something. 
 What is it? 
 Valentine sent a Shax demon to track us on our mission today. 
 It killed Ragnor Fell. 
 By the Angel... 
 Only a few people here at the Institute even knew we were going on the mission. 
 You overheard us this morning. Then we were attacked. 
 If I was working for Valentine, don't you think I would have already given him the Mortal Cup? 
 I don't believe this. 
 Fellow Shadowhunters accusing me of high treason. 
 Lydia, I'm not accusing you of anything. 
 Of course you are. 
 Unless you have hard evidence to back your claims, I believe this conversation is over. 
 Fine, but know this. 
 These people have become like family to me... and I protect my family. 
 I care about them too. 
 Why else would I be marrying Alec? 
 How well do you actually know him? 
 You're talking about Alec's feelings for Magnus? 
 I'm not blind. 
 If... if you're not in love with Alec, then why are you going through with this marriage? 
 Alec's love for his family and his desire to restore the Lightwood name has touched me in ways that I haven't felt in a very long time. 
 Alec is a man of honor... and I truly care about him. 
 But what about Alec's happiness? 
 Shadowhunters know that our duty to our family supersedes our personal desires. 
 Look, I know that you're still new to this world and our traditions may seem foreign to you, but I...  
 Yeah, more like ice cold. 
 Alec should not have to give up who he is, or at least the chance to figure it out, just to please his family. 
 But Alec proposed to me. 
 This is what he wants. 
 [sighs] 
 How do I trust you? 
 You're Valentine's daughter... and I learned to trust you. 
 Nice. 
 Trim fit. 
 It'll make it look like you work out. 
 Isabelle. 
 [stammers] Is... is Clary okay? 
 She's fine. [Sighs] 
 I just need your advice on something. 
 First time for everything, huh? 
 You can go now, Stan. What's up? 
 It's about Alec's bachelor party. 
 When you were a mundane, you went to one, right? 
 Well, I'm only 18, and I'm a vampire now, so... 
 But... I know a thing or two. [Chuckles] 
 Simon... what makes a bachelor party... a bachelor party? 
 Well, there is a certain bridge and tunnel crowd that would say the answer to that is strippers. [Chuckles] 
 But, you know, there's no one right way to throw a bachelor party. 
 It... depends on who's there. 
 Like... they're really about best friends coming together and assuring each other that they're always gonna be best friends. 
 Even if one of them gets married. 
 So it's about solidifying the bonds with the people that are closest to you? 
 That, and a ton of drinking. 
 [chuckles] You have both of those, and your bachelor party will be a success. 
 [sighs] 
 How I loathe that photograph. 
 I must remember, chin down, eyes up. 
 Otherwise, I look like a squinty toad. 
 You're here. 
 You didn't think you'd be rid of me that easily, did you? 
 [chuckling] Oh, my dear friend, I will always be here for you. 
 Now, please, put away that horrid photograph. 
 It commemorates a night I'd rather forget. 
 [chuckles] Oh, how I had to comfort you. 
 How I loved her. 
 I prayed she would love me the same, but she just laughed. 
 To Camille, immortals aren't supposed to feel true love. 
 She was so cynical. 
 Camille broke my heart. 
 You let her break your heart, my friend. 
 You're immortal... but she killed you. 
 [beeps] 
 [inhales deeply] 
 [cell phone beeps] 
 [sighs] 
 Ready? A couple more steps. 
 [dance music playing] 
 We're almost there! 
 All right, Izzy... [sighs] 
 You trust me, don't you? 
 [scoffs] No, not really. 
 And I told you, I don't need a bachelor party. 
 [sighs] You need this one. 
 [sighs] 
 Now, count to five, and take your blindfold off. 
 Really, Izzy? 
 Seriously? 
 Izzy said you wanted to talk. 
 I don't know what she thought I wanted to say. 
 Great. I guess I'll go. 
 I've got work to do anyway. 
 [exhales] Damn it, Izzy. 
 [sighs] You know what? She's right. 
 We do need to talk. 
 Okay. Well, it's my bachelor party, so you go first. 
 I don't know how things got so messed up between us. 
 But I do know my life has been a lot harder not having you to talk to. 
 [sighs] Mine, too. 
 I know it seems like I've been making a lot of crazy choices lately. 
 And I know you think that I was only thinking about myself... and Clary, and I wasn't thinking about the consequences to anyone else. 
 All I can say is, I've been going through a lot. 
 But I only ever did what I thought was right, Alec. 
 But I never wanted to hurt you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [sighs] I know. 
 You know, we just... got caught in all this drama. 
 Yeah. [Scoffs] 
 I mean... you're getting married tomorrow. 
 And Clary's your sister. 
 You know, what's up with that? 
 Hell. Yeah, uh, don't even get me started on that. 
 [sighs] 
 I kissed her. Mmm. 
 It's worse, I wanted her. 
 I was falling in love. 
 I must be sick or something. I don't know. 
 No. 
 Nah. 
 You're not sick. 
 Situation's just... 
 It's confusing. 
 And trust me, I know. 
 You know, it's like, you have this plan for your life... right, and you know what you need to do and what your responsibilities are. 
 And you think, you know, "If you follow the rules, everything's gonna be fine." 
 Then somebody comes along, and... [inhales] pushes you off that path. 
 You just... 
 Hey... I get it. 
 The point is, we're Shadowhunters. 
 Emotions get in the way. 
 And if you get knocked off the path, you have to focus... and find your way back. 
 I mean, you still have to be true to yourself. 
 I am. 
 [sighs] 
 I'm fulfilling my duty. 
 [sighs] 
 Look, would you be my  suggenes  and give me away tomorrow? 
 Alec, if this is what you really want... 
 I'd be honored. 
 [sighs] 
 I'm always gonna be here for you. 
 Me, too. 
 [playing out of tune] 
 I wouldn't describe that as an instrument of music. 
 An instrument of torture, perhaps. 
 Oh, you never liked the charango. 
 No, I did not. 
 And I pray you don't play it. 
 Death has already given me enough of a headache. 
 Do you remember Imasu? He played this so beautifully. 
 I'm surprised that lasted as long as it did. 
 He was always so much better looking than you. 
 [chuckles] I don't understand why you didn't go after the boy. 
 I'm certain, with very little effort, you could have won him back. 
 No. Imasu wanted more than I can give. 
 Maybe Camille was right. I am immortal. 
 I can party and have fun to my heart's content without the anchors of love around my feet. 
 Ragnar : You are not Camille. 
 And though I know you won't believe me, someday someone will come along who will tear down those walls you've built around your heart. 
 And when that love comes back to you, you must do everything in your power to fight for it. 
 Going somewhere? 
 Even in death... you give the best advice. 
 Be nice if you took it more than once every 300 years. 
 I... 
 [classical music playing] 
 When you first proposed to Lydia, I'll admit, I was wary. 
 But now... [inhales deeply] you've made me so proud. 
 [sighs] All right, you're ready for this? 
 As ready as I'll ever be. 
 Good. 
 I'm glad you're here with me. 
 Wouldn't be anywhere else. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Hey. 
 Did I miss anything? I left right at sunset. 
 No, you're right on time. 
 Cool. 
 Simon, you look incredible. 
 [chuckles] Thanks. I borrowed one of Raphael's suits. 
 Embracing the new me. 
 So, how's your mom? 
 She's good. 
 Uh, Luke's with her right now, watching over her. 
 [thudding]

You don't have to explain. Lydia, I'm sorry. Hey... you deserve to be happy. [chuckles] Okay? I'll be fine. [breathes deeply] ♪ I can't help but love you ♪ 
♪ Even though I try not to ♪ 
♪ I can't help but want you ♪ Alec, what are you doing? Enough. ♪ I can't help but be wrong in the dark ♪ [chuckles softly] ♪ 'Cause I'm overcome in this war of hearts ♪  You never cease to amaze me, Alec. Yeah... [exhales] What did I just do? Alec, I am so proud of you. Guys, that was incredible. It was like watching the live version of  The Graduate. You know, the Dustin Hoffman movie? The amazing one? You were Ben. [Mimics Ben] Elaine! And you were Elaine. I mean, a... a taller, masculine, handsome version of her. But at the altar, though, you were like... [mimics Elaine] Ben! [normal voice] And then... and then now, you're both sitting on the bus at the end of the movie, both totally stoked, but wondering, like... [inhales deeply] "What're we gonna do now?" You know? [Chuckles] Who invited the vampire? Seriously? Jace : Hey. What you just did for Alec... I, um...  It was the right thing to do. So what are you gonna do now? Head back to Idris. [sighs] Dive into work. There's no place for me here. There's always gonna be a place for you here. Give Alec and Magnus my best. [Jace sighs] Is Lydia gonna be okay? She'll be all right. [Clary sighs] Look, Clary... Listen, I just need to say that... you were right. Seeing what Alec just did, I realized I can't shut you out. I just don't know what to do with all this. Much as this will shock Alec, my visit tonight wasn't all for him. We need to speak privately.

(The camera focuses on an empty table in the institute. Magnus's hand comes into view and he snaps his finger. A wave of purple and blue magic goes through the table and makes various seemingly unrelated objects appear. Magnus, Alec, Jace, and Clary walk up and surround the table as they begin inspecting the objects.) Magnus: I pulled every item of magical importance from Ragnor's belongings. But I can't determine which will lead to the  Book of the White. Clary: Wait, this bookmark. I've seen it before. In the alternate dimension you showed me a book of spells, and this was in it. It must have been the  Book of the White. Alec : If that's the case, we can use the bookmark to track the owner of the book. Jace: Okay. (Jace reaches out to grab the bookmark, but Magnus grabs it before he can.) Magnus: Warlock tracking is stronger. [breathing deeply] Camille screaming : Let me out of here! [gasps] Magnus: Well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is I know the owner. The bad? It's Camille. Clary: Camille? Magnus: Looks like Raphael has her locked up in the basement of the Hotel DuMort. Clary: Well, after I punched her, there's no way she'll help me. Jace: She won't have a choice. Trust me.

[screams] [grunts] [groaning] [footsteps approaching] [straining] Why'd you ask me up here, Clary? I needed you to see this. What is all that? Luke told me that my mother had a son. [sighs] Jonathan Christopher. What's that? It's my name. "JC." Jace. Short for Jonathan Christopher. Jace, I know all of this is impossible to believe, but... our mother never abandoned you. She thought you were dead. This is all she had left, and she... she carried you with her every single day. Is all this really mine? [sighs] I don't know who I am anymore. There's darkness in me. It's always been there. And now I... [sighs] When we rescued Jocelyn... and I let Valentine go... I was tempted to go with him. He's my father. Maybe that's where I belong. Jace... I know you're a good man. I don't know how, but we are going to make sense of all this. I promise. [exhales] I'm so glad we got away from that crowd and all those people. So intense. I have to hand it to you, Alexander... you certainly know how to make a statement. [footsteps approaching] What have you done, Alec? To us, this family? This isn't about you. Of course it is. You are either being selfish or naive. This wedding was your plan from the start. And now you have humiliated us in front of the most respected members of the Clave. I don't even recognize you anymore. I'm the same person I've always been. Now everything's just out in the open. And all for a Downworlder. Just give her time. [Alec inhales deeply] And you? I don't really understand this. But I suppose our world is changing. How long has this been going on? Are you two in love? [scoffs] Love? What? No. No, it's... it's, uh, it's sort of a different... It's not... It's all very new. Right. [sighs] I better go check on Mom. [sighs] You know what I just realized? We still haven't gone on our date yet. [scoffs] Yeah, you're right. [sniffs] You wanna... I don't know, get a drink sometime? I would love that. Great. Looks like we missed the wedding of the year. It's all right. You and I will be able to share our love openly one day. How is she? She's asleep... but she's home. You okay, Hodge? Yeah. You should get some rest. You've been so vigilant. Why don't you let me watch over her. Thank you, my friend. Of course. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. You have the Cup. Help me break my Punishment rune... and I will bring it to you. A deal is a deal.
