 My name is Clary and I'm a Shadowhunter, born to protect mankind from demons.   
 A never-ending battle against evil, but I know who I can count on.   
 Simon, my oldest friend. A vampire.   
 Magnus, a warlock from Brooklyn.   
 Luke, a werewolf pack leader and New York City cop, and Jace, Izzy and Alec, three of the bravest 
Shadowhunters alive.   
 Alone, we're strong.   
 Together, we are unstoppable.   
 CLARY:  Previously on  Shadowhunters...    
 Valentine wants to use the soul sword to decimate the entire Downworld, and he needs    
 - (RINGING) 
- Clary to activate it.    
 - I'm losing my patience. 
- (WHIMPERING)    
 - Simon, drink. 
- Stop them!    
 If Jace touches the sword, his grip would destroy it.    
 Jace's plan is gonna work.    
 Let's move!    
 CLARY: Jace! It'll kill you!    
 (GRUNTING)    
 CLARY: He activated it.    
 (CRIES OF PAIN)    
 You didn't inject me with demon blood, it was angel blood!    
 You are not my son. 
Clary is not your sister.    
 (GRUNTING)    
 - CLARY: Jace, don't.

 You didn't even touch me.    
 I'm not talking about that.    
 I'm talking about the Downworlders.    
 Jace, you didn't know.    
 Wasn't your fault.    
 I never said it was.    
 Come on, you got another round in you or Startin' to get tired?

 So what does this pure angel blood do for you anyway?    
 I don't know, other than the ability to activate that sword. Maybe that's all it's good for.    
 Clary's got the ability to draw new runes, so you must be able to do something special.    
 You mean, other than kick your ass?

 CLARY: I don't think the sun has ever felt this good.    
 Yeah.    
 Hey. Look at us.    
 On our favourite bench, in the day.    
 We're like a normal couple!    
 It's funny how normal doesn't even feel normal anymore.    
 I'm not even a normal vampire. 
I'm a freak of vamp nature.    
 You are not a freak.    
 You're unique.    
 Special. Sexy.    
 Don't you think there has to be some sort of downside?    
 We've already seen the downside, Simon.    
 It's... it's time to start focussing on the upside.    
 My Bubbie Helen always says there are no handouts in life, that everything comes with a price.    
 Well, that is not necessarily true.    
 What if I'm walking to the subway and then next thing I know, I'm a scorch mark on  th Avenue...     
 Well, let's not think about that, OK?     
 Look, we've... we've been through so much.     
 Lost... so much.     
 But now... we have each other.     
 And it's good.     
 It's really, really good.     
 Mmhmm.     
 So... enjoy it.     
 OK.     
 I will. Starting right now.     
 Thank you.     
 JACE: Clary.     
 Sorry. What are you doing here?     
 Is... is everything OK?     
 Inquisitor Herondale just arrived at the Institute.     
 She wants to speak with us. Now.     
 Let me get my stuff.     
 Jace, there's something I wanted to tell you.     
 No matter what, your secret's safe with me.     
 What secret?     
 You know, how your pure angelic blood somehow made me immune to the sun.     
 You don't know that's what happened.     
 What else could it be?     
 My point is, if any vampire were to find out, there'd be a bullseye on your carotid artery.     
 You have nothing to worry about. I got your back.     
 Get in here.     
 Stop it.     
 - I just... 
- No.     
 Never. Clary, you ready?     
 Yeah.     
 - I'll call you tonight? 
- Yeah.     
 (SEARING)     
 (SCREAMING)     
 (GRUNTING)     
 I could keep going, or you could tell me where you hid the Mortal Cup.     
 Now where's the fun in that, huh?     
 You know, this quest of yours to collect the three Mortal Instruments to raise the angel Raziel... it was a fool's errand.     
 A fool doesn't demand this kind of attention, now would he?     
 No one's ever seen the Mortal Mirror.     
 We have no idea if it even exists.     
 The Clave has no idea about a multitude of things.     
 Well, this much is certain.     
 At this point, your only way to avoid execution is hand over the Cup.     
 (CHUCKLING)     
 Actually, it's quite the opposite. See, knowing where the Mortal Cup is... that's the only thing that's keeping me alive.     
 Valentine, you and I both know, the cup can control demons.     
 In the wrong hands, it could be catastrophic.     
 In your hands, I'm a dead man.     
    Shadowhunters died in your assault on this institute, along with hundreds of Downworlders that you massacred with the Soul Sword.     
 Justice will be served.     
 (SCREAMING)     
 Make it stop!     
 Stop!

 How long can you keep torturing him?     
 As long as it takes.     
 If you want the truth, why not just use the soul sword?     
 You're telling me how to do my job?     
 No, but you said you retrieved the sword right after the attack. I just don't understand why you wouldn't...     
 The rune your sister drew to deactivate the sword ended up damaging it in the process.     
 It's been sent to the Iron Sisters to be purified.     
 You're Valentine's children.     
 Tell me what you know.     
 Nothing. Haven't we proven ourselves?     
 Valentine attacked the Institute. We captured him.     
 At what cost? By taking matters into your own hands, you've planted the seeds of rebellion in the Downworld. The Accords will be near impossible to maintain now.     
 Fall in line, or you'll end up like Aldertree and Idris facing reprimand.

 Don't.     
 I know you're part of Herondale's security detail.     
 I also know that you've captured Valentine, which means you have the Cup, or you know where it is.

 RUSSELL: Your sister...     
 Your brother and my friend are family.     
 We can't replace them. But if we don't move forward because of them...     
 It's getting pretty heated out there.     
 They just need to blow off some steam.     
 They're losing faith in you, Luke. They think you brought us into a battle you knew we couldn't win.     
 Is that what you think?     
 No. They're scared, and so am I. I mean, Russell's out there talking about hunting mundanes.     
 Saying that's the only way we can rebuild the pack.     
 Turning innocent humans?     
 RUSSELL: As a family, then we will fade out of existence!     
 I mean, come on, does anybody else have any better ideas?     
 Hey! Nobody's turning anybody.     
 Says the alpha who killed three quarters of the pack.     
 Luke didn't kill anybody, and we can't just go around hunting mundanes.     
 Why not? You think they'd hesitate to attack us if the tables were turned? Huh?     
 Alright. That's enough.     
 That's right. It is enough, Luke... because I challenge you. 
Right here, right now.     
 Russell, you need to relax.     
 He is not fit to be our alpha. Not anymore.     
 Come on, let's go!     
 We've all had a rough time, so I'm giving you a chance to reconsider, because I've seen way too many wolves die to stomach seeing another.

 This looks like a demon attack.     
 JACE: I've never seen a demon cause this kind of hemorrhaging.     
 Is there any security footage?     
 LUKE: Nothing in the bar. Maybe CCTV caught something outside on the street.     
 We should get them back to the Institute.     
 Yeah, that's a good idea.     
 Detective Garroway?     
 Who are you talking to?     
 Just dictating some notes while they're still fresh.     
 Something you should start doing.     
 OLLIE: That's a great idea! They didn't mention it in training, but it makes perfect sense.     
 Is there some special app for that?

 GUARD: Raphael.     
 Isabelle...     
 What are you doing here?     
 Uh... I w... I wanted to apologize.     
 It was a terrible night and I took my anger out on you.     
 You were only trying to save your people.     
 It's not safe for a Shadowhunter to be at the DuMort right now.     
 Especially one looking for vampire venom.     
 Raphael, I think... if I can have a small bite, over time I can have less and less.     
 It doesn't work like that.     
 Why not?     
 Well... we can manage it... together.     
 You really should go.     
 Wait. OK.     
 What... what do you want from me?     
 I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... 
I'll give you anything you wa...     
 I want you... to leave.     
 I'm just asking for a little taste.     
 You know you want it.     
 I'm not doing this, Isabelle.     
 Seriously? This is how you treat me when I need you the most? I thought you cared about me Raphael but I guess I was wrong.     
 It's because I care.     
 I should have never given you a taste.     
 Oh, Isabelle.

 CLARY: Just got off the phone with Luke.     
 He made it look like a tragic gas leak.     
 According to the autopsy, the victims died of massive brain hemorrhaging.     
 - A demon can do that? 
- A Greater Demon can.     
 Wh... what exactly is the difference?     
 Lesser Demons are a dime a dozen in New York. Greater Demons are a whole different story.     
 They have names, personalities.     
 They're much more powerful and they're harder to stop.     
 They're also incredibly rare.     
 When they do show their face, there's a reason.     
 Jace, are you OK?     
 Yeah, why wouldn't I be?     
 Well, you've barely spoken about what happened with the Soul Sword.     
 Yeah, well,     
 there's not much to talk about.     
 OK, but if you do feel like talking, I'm here for you. I'm your sister, Jace.     
 I know what you're going through.

 Right. A real prince.

 Hello, Alec.

 Nothing he says matters to me.     
 Your sister's in trouble.

 I don't understand.     
 Why Izzy?     
 What does a Greater Demon want with her?

 I have no idea what you're talking about...but it's so nice to see the both of you.     
 Azazel wouldn't leave Duduael on his own.     
 Someone broke him out.     
 Someone with access to the Mortal Cup.     
 Circle Members. They released the Greater Demon to break you out of here.     
 I thought I raised you to have common sense.     
 If the Greater Demon wanted to free me, how would I still be here having this inane conversation with you two?     
 I want to banish demon filth from our realm.     
 If that's true, then tell your followers to give back the cup. We can force Azazel to give us Izzy.     
 I don't know where the Mortal Cup is.     
 If you're lying, so help the Angel.     
 If you were smart, Jace, you'd use me as bait.     
 The only way to control a Greater Demon is with the Mortal Cup.     
 Azazel would do anything to destroy it.     
 So summon him with your warlock friend and tell him I have the Cup.     
 Offer him a trade. Me for Isabelle.     
 That could work.     
 Once we have Izzy, I can take him out with my sunlight rune.     
 This is a trap. What could possibly make you think that we could trust him?     
 I'm not sure I would trust me either if I were you, but the longer Azazel has Isabelle, the greater the chance she dies.     
 We don't have a choice, Jace.     
 This better not be a trap. 
Your life is on the line too.

 Look, it'll help with the pain of your venom addiction.     
 Speed up your recovery.     
 Come on.     
 (SIGHING)     
 Mmhmm.     
 (SIGHING)     
 Yeah, it's not a miracle drug.     
 It'll wear off soon and you'll feel like crap again, but it does help.     
 So, why aren't you in London with... your Institute?     
 I had to kick my Yin Fen addiction, and let's just say that London wasn't the best place to do that. So, I um...     
 I took matters into my own hands.     
 I left.     
 And I found my way to New York.     
 You went AWOL?     
 SEBASTIAN CHUCKLING: I like to think of it more like a walk about, but um... the good news is, I was successful.     
 You can be, too.     
 Thank you so much.     
 I should probably get going.     
 You walk out that door and within an hour you'll be back in a vampire den, begging for a bite.     
 You need at least a day to get enough venom out of your system to be able to handle yourself.     
 If you want to leave, I won't stop you.     
 OLLIE: Well, I'll swing by the pho place on my way home.     
 I know, I know. Not too spicy.     
 Will you stop? Stop! 
I'm at work. Bye. Sorry.     
 My girlfriend Samantha. She was supposed to grab dinner, but...     
 She... pho-got?     
 Oh my God. A joke.     
 (BOTH LAUGHING)     
 So you are human after all.     
 Well, what about you? You have someone?     
 Wife? Girlfriend? Boyfriend?     
 First rule of being my partner: no personal questions.     
 You say that now, but I don't think it's normal to sit in a car with someone all day and not chat. I mean, if we're gonna be partners, we have to get to know each other.     
 (KNOCKING)     
 - We need to talk. 
- Is that your girlfriend?     
 Cute. Young. (GIGGLING)     
 Hi! I'm Ollie. Luke's pretty private about his personal life, but I'm glad he has one.     
 She's not my girlfriend.     
 MAIA: Russell's gone. 
He took all his stuff.     
 Good riddance. He was bad for the pack.     
 He also took Reid, Greg, and Segan.     
 They don't trust you. 
They're headed down to Philly to start their own pack. 
They asked me to go with them.     
 Look, if you wanna leave, by all means.     
 I'm not going anywhere, Luke. But there's only a few of us left. How's the pack going to survive?     
 Look, I don't care if it's just you and me, we'll figure out a way.     
 But I won't let it come to that.     
 I've been out recruiting other members from other packs.     
 Trust me.     
 Plenty of wolves want to eat at the Jade Wolf.     
 (LAUGHING)     
 No, they don't.     
 - Yeah, right. 
- (LAUGHING)     
 (CAMERA CLICKING)     
 
 
 
 (DOOR UNLOCKING)     
 ALEC: There you are.     
 Magnus is downstairs and the Inquisitor's Council meeting will be over in an hour.     
 We don't have much time.     
 Jace, you OK?     
 (PIANO MUSIC)     
 (JACE CRYING)     
 ISABELLE: Mm! Oh my God, I haven't eaten in days and this is amazing.     
 I ate at this café in Paris, once.     
 And I watched this chef make his Bouillabaisse.     
 And so the next time I wanted soup, I copied him.     
 What do you mean, you copied him?     
 I memorized everything he did.     
 And then I did it myself and  voilà!   
 (SEBASTIAN CHUCKLING)     
 Yeah.     
 Sometimes just... knowing that someone else can do something remarkable makes it possible for you to do it too.     
 You need to call your Institute.     
 Let them know you're OK.     
 I know, but...     
 I've just let so many people down, especially my brother, that I don't know if he's gonna be able to forgive me.     
 Look, it might take some time, but my guess is he will.     
 You don't know Alec. He's... he's just like my mom.     
 Stubborn and strong-willed.     
 Yeah, I know all about stubborn strong-willed mothers.     
 - Yeah? 
- Mmhmm.     
 Is she in London?     
 No.     
 No, she, uh...     
 Well, she's gone now, so.     
 Oh. I'm sorry.     
 Oh, don't be. She was miserable.     
 Yeah.     
 In the end, I forgave her, but, she loved me.     
 She just had a... strange way of showing it.     
 Look, don't let your brother worry.     
 Hey, Clary, it's me. Are we still on for tonight?     
 'Cause I can't wait to tell you about the day I had. Headlines...     
 I'm going back to NYU, majoring in... wait for it...     
 - (SYMBOLS CLANGING) 
- Music!     
 Minoring in accounting for mom. Everyone's happy.     
 - Call me back. Bye. 
- (BEEPING)     
 (HUMMING)     
 - Oh, G... ! 
- (SHARPLY INHALING)     
 You ever tried not sneaking up on people?     
 I'm sorry, I didn't want to interrupt.     
 You said you were having a... day?     
 Yeah, you know... inside.     
 Really?     
 Because I heard a funny rumor that you were at the Hunter's Moon this afternoon.     
 What?     
 Pfft. That's weird. Who told you that?     
 Why are people talking about me?     
 Why are you panicking?     
 I'm not panicking.     
 It's true, isn't it?     
 You're a daylighter?     
 There's a name for it?     
 Yeah, in the legends.     
 I just never believed that they could be real.     
 OK. Yes, I can walk in the sun, but you don't need to advertise that.     
 Not everyone needs to know.     
 How'd it happen?     
 Not sure, really. You know, there's a lot of carcinogens in here that I could have been exposed to, bugs...     
 Simon, I've been a vampire for    years.     
 You've been one for what, two weeks?     
 This isn't the sort of information you should be hoarding for yourself.     
 Well, I swear Raphael.     
 Told you everything I know.     
 Yeah.     
 I hope so.     
 (CHAINS RATTLING)     
 Is the courtyard glamoured?     
 No one can see us.     
 - (ALEC SIGHING): I don't know.     
 Still seems like a risk.     
 We have no choice.     
 This is the only space big enough.     
 JACE: Security cameras in the cell are down.     
 We've got a half hour until the Inquisitor's done with her meeting.     
 Is Clary ready?     
 Let's do this.     
 I call upon the power of the Pentagram.     
 Azazel, I summon thee.     
 From within our realm, into this mystical confinement, I summon thee.     
 You seek the Mortal Cup. We seek the return of our friend.     
 For this exchange, I summon thee.     
 (THUNDER)     
 Well...     
 ... if it isn't Magnus Bane.     
 Brave move.     
 MAGNUS: Return Isabelle Lightwood... and we'll hand over Valentine.     
 He can lead you to the Mortal Cup.     
 Valentine Morgenstern.     
 The man who dares to dream big.     
 It is a tempting offer, but I don't have your friend Isabelle.     
 He's lying.     
 JACE: I'm not so sure.     
 There's no time for debate. 
The barrier's weakening.     
 We can still find Isabelle, but we can't let Azazel get away.     
 Clary, now!     
 It's...     
 It's not working!     
 What are you talking about?     
 Nothing's happening!     
 You thought you could contain me?!

 I should have called you, but...     
 I figured you'd be so angry with me, and...

 After everything you've been through, that wasn't fair.     
 No, I, uh... I actually think you were right.

 How you holding up?     
 Other than feeling like a total failure...

 How did you do it?     
 You activated a rune without your stelae.     
 I don't know.     
 Saw you lying there.     
 And it just kind of...     
 ... ignited. On its own.     
 None of this makes sense.     
 But we'll figure it out.
