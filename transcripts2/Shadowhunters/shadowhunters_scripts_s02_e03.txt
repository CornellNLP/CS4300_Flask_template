 Isabelle :  Previously on  Shadowhunters... 
 (GRUNTS) 
 No! 
 You set me up. 
 You just tried to murder your own son! 
 Aldertree : Jace Wayland is a traitor to the Clave. 
 Thanks for letting me crash here. You're a lifesaver. 
 You told Victor Aldertree I'm responsible for one of Camille's dens. 
 Bring her back to the Hotel DuMort or die trying. 
 And the  adamas  can track Jace? 
 Not by itself. 
 Give me the stone. 
 You need to stay near the surface. 
 If you go too deep, nothing can bring you back. 
 Valentine : There's only one last thing for you to do. 
 Kill her. 
 Jace... Run! 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (GROANS) 
 Valentine : Jonathan! There's nowhere to run. 
 (GROANING) 
 Isabelle : Alec! 
 Whoa. 
 Same side. 
 My bad. 
 Mom and Dad said you weren't coming till tomorrow. 
 Well, here I am. 
 I'm Jace. 
 Alec. 
 See, you're hesitating on the release. 
 I get enough crap from my parents. Don't need it from you. 
 Sorry. (SIGHS) 
 See, I'm not used to, you know, other people. 
 Mind if I try? 
 Oh. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 See, it's all about confidence. 
 Once you believe you're the best... 
 You'll be unstoppable. 
 Jace, I... (MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY) 
 It's not working. 
 (GRUNTS) I'm sorry, Isabelle. 
 Parabatai  bonds are like a tether that binds two souls. 
 Jace and Alec share emotions, instincts, strength. 
 It's an angelic bond. My magic can only do so much. 
 So Jace is like this, too? 
 Not necessarily. 
 It appears that when Alec called out to him, part of his soul never returned. 
 Now he's stuck, lost somewhere between himself and his  parabatai. 
 But if Jace brought back that missing piece of his soul... 
 We may very well have the cure. 
 Whatever we do, we need to do it quickly. 
 Stay with Alec. I'll go find Jace. 
 (COUGHING) 
 (PANTING) 
 My stele. 
 Clary? 
 Gretel. 
 Hey! What's going on? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Hey, wait. Listen. This isn't what you think... 
 Someone call the police! 
 Please. Hey, please stop. 
 Call 911! 
 Hey! Hey, no. No. You can't go in there... 
 Where's Izzy? 
 Raj : I'm getting Aldertree. 
 Clary, are you okay? 
 I'm fine. Just... I need to see Izzy. 
 Jocelyn : Clary, wait. 
 Clary : No. 
 What happened? Where have you been? 
 Aldertree : We're all curious. 
 Bring a change of clothes and a hot cup of tea to my office. 
 Clary and I are gonna have a little chat. 
 I just... 
 Please, let me see Isabelle. 
 She's with Alec, Clary. 
 He was trying to help me find you, and something went wrong. 
 He's in a bad way. 
 (CELL PHONE RINGING) 
 (INHALES SHARPLY) 
 Elaine : (OVER PHONE)  Simon, it's Mom. I haven't heard from you in a while. 
 I... I just wanted to make sure everything was okay. 
 Simon, I'm really worried. 
 I... I know you said you wanted to try living in the dorms, but I called your RA, and he said no one has seen you in weeks. What's going on? Please call me back. Oh, Mom. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Beati Bellicosi. She was a sweet kid. No, she wasn't. She was a giant pain in my ass. I'm gonna miss her. Any leads? The witness saw a blonde male fleeing the scene. Let me guess. Early 20's, covered in tats? Let's keep the mundanes out of this. It's better if the pack handles it. You really think he killed her? I don't know what to believe. (KNOCKING) JOCELYN: Isabelle? Clary's back. Oh, great. Clary's safe. We can all go home now. Whoa. Wait, Magnus. How's Alec? Is he gonna be okay? Do you remember the first thing I said to you when you brought a frightened six-year-old girl to my door? You didn't wanna get involved in Shadowhunter business. And I should've stuck to my guns. But no, I let you convince me. How many years of memory wipes was it? Twelve. Look, I owe you. Let me help with Alec. I think you've done enough. I was only trying to find... You were only trying to do what you always do. Manipulate people into helping fix problems that you created. And now Alec is paying the price for it. That's not true. Then prove me wrong. It appears you've had quite the harrowing experience. Jocelyn tells me you were abducted by Dorothea Rollins, a warlock under Valentine's control. Uh, that's right. Did she Portal you to a tanker ship in the East River? I'm not sure. Three hours ago, a large tanker ship was found there, recently abandoned. By the mottoes and the insignia on the boat, it's clear the Circle was on board. If you have any information about Valentine, about Jace... you need to tell me. The last thing I remember is Dot grabbing me off the street. Then I... I woke up in the water. I was nearly run over by the Staten Island Ferry, and then I swam to shore and came here. If you're trying to protect your brother, lying to me is only gonna make it worse. I can guarantee Jace's safety if you help me bring him in. And that's on record. I would if I could, but I can't tell you what I don't know. Dot must have wiped my memory. Isabelle : I can't believe you lied to Aldertree. I couldn't let him go after Jace like he did before. So Dot took down the wards and you two jumped off the ship together? Yeah, but as soon as we hit the water, the tide was so strong. We lost each other... I looked everywhere. I couldn't find him. Wait, if he and Alec are going through the same thing, he wouldn't be able to swim. He could be... No. Jace is alive. If he were dead, Alec's  parabatai  rune would have faded. So that's good news, right? Yeah. But I don't know how much time Alec has left. (SIGHS) Jace might be his only hope, and for all we know Valentine and the Circle have already found him. Look, Isabelle... Jace is the strongest person I know. We're gonna find him. I promise. (SIGHS) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Well, you look like you could use a drink. And a towel. Just, um... Just your phone? I'd ask what happened to yours, but I'm guessing it got wet. It's a long story. Well, I'm stuck here all night, and besides, I hear Shadowhunters love to hear themselves talk. What, you didn't think I would recognize those runes on the back of your neck? You're a werewolf. Typically, the phone is for paying customers, but I'm feeling generous, so... On the house. Thank you. (CLEARS THROAT) Maia. It's nice to meet you. Clary : We need to find something of Jace's. Don't bother. Aldertree already has people tracking him 24/7. Jace must be using a rune to block it, otherwise somebody would've found him by now. Has he been in there with Alec the whole time? He's the only reason Alec still has a chance. But his magic can't last forever. Sooner or later, he's gonna burn out. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Jace :  Izzy, it's me. Jace. Are you okay? (STAMMERS) I'm a little soggy, but I'll live. Look, is Clary... She's here. She's safe. Jace, it's me. We need to get you to Alec. What do you mean? Why? He tried tracking you with his  parabatai  rune, but now, it's like he's stuck in some kind of nightmare and can't wake up. He was looking for you, so you're the only one who can help him. Okay. I'll... I'll get there. But you can't. The Clave still wants you dead. Yeah, well, who doesn't? They can get in line. Meet us at Magnus'. We'll figure out how to get Alec there. Okay. I'll get there as soon as I can. Maia : All good? Yeah. Thank you. Didn't seem good. It's nothing you need to worry about. Cool, 'cause we could use your help. Shadowhunter help. You see Taito back there? The Circle took his goddaughter. Right in front of him. So I was hoping maybe you could help him out. I... I wish I could. You have something better to do? It's not like that. Maia : I'm still waiting for an explanation. I can't. I'm sorry. You need to do your job, Shadowhunter. You're supposed to protect us. My brother needs me. I just... I just need to go. I think he is the one that needs protecting. This is the guy who kidnapped Gretel. Look, I don't wanna hurt anyone, okay? That's too bad. 'Cause we do. (GROWLING) Look... (BOTH GRUNTING) Really? (GROANS) (GRUNTING) Damn it. (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANING) Hey, Mom. Just got your messages. Just wanted to let you know I'm not dead, so, uh, don't call the police. Um... I know you're upset that we haven't talked in a while, so I was thinking of stopping by the house. Hopefully you're home. That's it. Bye. Going home? Just a detour. My mom's called me, like, 30 times. I just have to tell her that my band went on tour, and I'll be right back on Camille. You know, if you spent the amount of time looking for Camille that you spend telling me to look for her, you'd probably have found her by now. I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation. I've got the whole clan searching, but she's your sire. But there are others, right? I can't be the most qualified vampire Camille's turned. No, but sadly, you're the only one left. All the other vampires she sired have joined her side. There's a civil war brewing, and Camille is gaining power. I'll be right back on Camille as soon as I deal with my family. We are your family now. And what? Just supposed to forget my mom? Your mom? Your mom will grow old while you stay the same. And eventually she'll be gone. Sooner or later, even your memories of her will fade, whether you want them to or not. No. That won't happen. Not to me. Keep telling yourself that. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) Simon : Mom? (KNOCKING) Anybody home? (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV) Oh, no. How are we gonna get Alec to Magnus' apartment? Aldertree has people everywhere. Not a problem. My parents want to get Alec to Idris. Magnus will create a Portal. We'll take it to Jace instead. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hey, Simon. (SHUDDERING) Clary, my mom's missing. She's drinking again. Oh, no. It's all my fault. She's been sober ever since that bender she went on after Dad died, but I found a bottle of vodka in her bedroom, and there hadn't been alcohol in the house for years. Clary, if anything happened to her because of me, I... (SIMON STAMMERING) Simon, slow down. How long has your mom been gone? (SIGHS) I don't know. I tried calling, but she won't pick up. I don't know where she is. Clary, I need your help. Hang on. Izzy, Simon needs me. (SIGHS) Be there for your friend. Magnus and I have everything under control. Thanks, Izzy. I'm on my way. And Simon, grab something of Elaine's. Something important to her. Uh... Okay, I got just the thing. Luke : Look familiar? Yeah, he's prettier in person, but that's the guy. Should have never let him get away. After what he did to Gretel, I vote we return the favor. This is not a democracy. Nobody kills anybody until I say so. Oh, he can, but we can't? That's not what I said. He kidnapped her. What more evidence do you need? I was there. And the witness found him standing over the body in the morning. I mean, you're the detective. Isn't that what you call an open-and-shut case? No, it's not. Jace is too smart to leave a body laying around. Whose side are you on? I'm on the side of the law. Taito : Whose law? Chill, Taito. I think we've had enough bar fights for one day. I know the rules. Blood for blood. If Jace is really doing Valentine's dirty work, I'll kill him myself. Best team. Best team. It's okay, Alec. You hear me? We're gonna get you out of here and bring you back. You put in a request to transfer your brother to Idris? My parents put in the request. Alec isn't leaving this institute. I'm sure his warlock friend can figure something out. Here. This isn't waking Sleeping Beauty with a kiss. Runic power is deep. It requires magic that can't be accessed in the walls of this institute. I don't know what you're up to, and, ultimately, I don't care. But as far as I'm concerned, your brother is too weak to be Portaled. You're just using Alec as bait to arrest Jace. No, I'm working to capture the fugitive who put Alec in this position. I have allowed this warlock into the Institute for the sole purpose of treating your brother. Although, you don't seem to be doing too good a job of it. I'm placing Raj by the door. Do not try this again. I'm just under orders. Shut up, Raj. (SIGHS) Young Jace : Almost there. (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) We can't get cocky. What do you mean "we"? Wait, you think I'm cocky? (CHUCKLES) It's not my fault that I'm naturally gifted. That's what make us a great team. I draw them out, and you... (GROWLING) Do all the work? (CHUCKLES) Like I said... we make a great team. Whoa. The best team. You realize that this is our final test, right? Once we get our  parabatai  runes, we'll officially be brothers. Nothing can change that. Hey, let's go tell Izzy. Yeah, sure. 
 
 Alec, this is a good thing. Of course it is. Come on, man. It's... It's time to celebrate. (CHUCKLES) Now you're talking. (GASPING SOFTLY) (GROANING) (GRUNTING) Maia : You can't hide your scent, Shadowhunter. (GRUNTS) (GROANS) Man : You okay? You okay? I'm calling 911. Jace : No. No, don't. Please. Don't worry, pal. You're gonna be okay. Yeah, hi, I need an ambulance. This guy's bleeding real bad. I'm at the Union Street station... (GRUNTING) Subway entrance. Looks like he was in an accident. (GRUNTING SOFTLY) Room four, stat! (GROANING) I'm okay. He's waking up! I gotta get to my brother. Give him ten milligrams of morphine. You don't understand. He's gonna die. My job is to save you, not your brother. No... No... Anything? (SIGHS) Sorry. I'm still figuring out this tracking stuff. You know, Isabelle says I need to clear my mind, but it's kinda hard to be Zen when you're a Shadowhunter. Simon : If only I'd checked in, called every once in a while instead of totally avoiding her. Well, maybe it's worth telling her the truth. What? Come out of the coffin? Do you have any idea how she'll react? Well, there's only one way to find out. (STAMMERS) I don't know, Clary. It's a lot to wrap your head around. Simon. Don't forget, okay? This is the woman who put up with your endless band practices, your incurable hypochondria... (CHUCKLES) who made you those gross mustard sandwiches when you refused to eat anything else. If she can accept you for all that, I'm pretty sure she can accept you for who you are. Okay? You know, mustard is actually high in antioxidants. (CHUCKLES) It's actually pretty good for you. And the white bread... Simon. Simon, I feel her. She's this way, come on! Yeah, yeah. (CLARY PANTING) (ALEC GRUNTING) Alec : No. It's too late. I... Alec? (INHALES SHARPLY) You know you're gonna have to clean that up? I feel you, man, but I have direct orders. If you can't help him, then you need to go. My magic is the only thing keeping Alec from completely slipping away. I won't leave. I know you're old, but I didn't realize you were hard of hearing. He's clearly not waking up any time soon, so you can leave now, or I can remove you myself... (CHOKING) I'm sorry. I don't like being rushed. (GROANS) Isabelle : Magnus, stop. We need to get Alec out of here, but this isn't helping. (EKG MONITOR BEEPING) Doctor : This can't be right. Nurse : I'm telling you, I ran the blood work three times. Whatever's going on with this guy, it's not normal. Doctor : I'll take a look. Excuse me. Nurse : Officer? Any chance you've seen this person? We got a tip that he might be in the ER. Over there. He came in a few hours ago. But we still need to run a few tests before we can clear... It's okay. We just wanna have a quick chat. (SIGHS) Look around. He's gotta be here somewhere. Nurse : Hey, you! What do you think you're doing? Look, I'm sorry about your brother, but I already told... You don't understand. I gotta get out of here right now. You're not going anywhere. (BONES CRACKING) With the amount of blood you've lost, you're lucky to be alive. (GROWLING) If you'd gotten to us a few hours later, you'd be... (GROWLING CONTINUES) What the hell is that sound? (GASPS) Oh, my God. (GROWLING) Let the mundane go. You have every reason to want me dead, but if you just let me explain, I... (SNARLING) (PANTING) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Jonathan. How'd you find me? I followed the wolves. Alec needs you. I'm here to help. Like you did last time when you shot an arrow at my head? I love those maternal instincts, but I think I'll pass. Jonathan... It's Jace. I'm so sorry. What your father did to you, the choices I had to make... (POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING) Yeah, well, I guess we both drew the short straw. Life lesson, don't fall in love with the devil, right? And you've suffered the most. I can't change what happened. Just let me help you get back to Alec. (SCOFFS) And back to the Clave, who wants me dead? The Clave can be reasoned with. The wolves can't. Just let me do this one thing for my son. You know, I made it this far on my own. I think I'll keep it that way. (GRUNTING) (PANTING) Still no improvement? Happy now? Not at all. Alec's one of our best. It'd be a shame to lose him. We're not gonna lose him. So confident. Almost too confident. (SCOFFS) Well, that's unfortunate. When are you gonna realize that Jace is on our side? Our side doesn't murder werewolves. Oh. So he didn't mention that little transgression. I'm sure there's an explanation. Not according to Lucian Graymark's pack. I was hoping to protect Jace by bringing him here, but clearly you've made other plans. So now it looks like the pack will get their pound of flesh after all. How far is Luke's pack from closing in on Jace? (CHUCKLES) Why should I tell you anything? Because I know where Jace is. He's at Magnus' loft in Brooklyn. Well then, the wolves are close. Getting to him before they do could prove difficult. Not if you give me access to a Portal. I'll save Jace and I'll save Alec. All right. But afterwards, you turn Jace over to me. Do we have a deal? (SOFTLY) Come back. Come back. Please come back. I'm all out of answers. I've tried everything. Except... (TAKES DEEP BREATH) Why aren't you getting ready? This is a mistake. I'm not going through with it. (SCOFFS) That's hysterical. Whatever happened between you two, why don't you just kiss and make up? This just doesn't feel right. You're not making any sense. All you've been talking about since Jace arrived was becoming  parabatai. And now you're actually doing it. Well, I thought if anyone would understand, it would be you. You don't have one. I've never wanted one. But you and Jace click. Everyone knows you guys are better fighters together than you are apart. Super helpful, Izzy. Thanks. All these years of training, and you're just gonna call it off? Are you nuts? I mean, the only time that actually happens is when somebody falls in love with... Oh. Don't say another word. I get it. No, you don't. Okay, maybe I don't. I know you're obnoxious and stubborn... I hope you're going somewhere with this. But you're also loyal and honest and a big old softie when you stop worrying about what people are thinking about you. One day, somebody's gonna love you, heart and soul. If you walk away from Jace, you might never find another  parabatai. Is that really a risk you're willing to take? (SIGHS) Clary, you did it. Thank you. Oh, um... I think this is a solo mission. A good friend of mine convinced me I should tell her the truth. Well, she sounds like a very smart friend. Who said it was a she? (BOTH CHUCKLE) Hey, you got this. (CELL PHONE RINGING) (CHUCKLES) Clary, Luke's pack wants Jace dead. They think he killed one of their own. Wait, what? No, no, no. They have it all wrong. Valentine killed her. Well, nobody told them that. They're closing in on him, so I had to make a deal with Aldertree. He has a warlock creating a Portal now,  but even then, I don't know if I can get to Jace before the pack does. Maybe I can. Mom. Simon? Oh, thank God! Oh, I thought something terrible had happened. I have been looking everywhere for you. I'm so sorry. There's something I need to tell you about where I've been and who I am. It's all right. I know. You do? What, did you think I wasn't going to find out? I mean... Oh, monkey, you should have told me. I've been so worried. (STAMMERS) If your band manager hadn't found me and told me everything that's been going on, I don't know what I would've done. My band manager? Yeah. Hello, Simon. You told my mom? (SCOFFS) Of course I did. I can't believe you didn't tell her we were out on tour. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Right. I'm sorry, Mom. My phone died, among other things. Well, Raphael was so kind to keep me company until we found you. (CHUCKLES) You know, Simon, you should take better care of your mother. It's far too late for anyone to be wandering the streets alone. I know you'd feel horrible if anything were to happen to her. Oh, you're sweet, but you don't have to worry about me. Oh, sweetie, you're so pale and... Cold. Let me get you a hot drink. I'll be right back. Thanks, Mom. What the hell? You should be looking for Camille, not your mother. You're threatening my family. And you're threatening mine. The longer Camille is free, the more people she kills. My people. Don't make me stoop to Camille's level. Well, now that Simon's back, I think it's time I get going. Really? Oh, I wish there was something I could do to thank you for everything. You know what? Why don't you join us at our house for dinner? We can talk about Simon's music career and his accounting career. Mom, he can't. He's extremely busy. Honey, any friend of yours is a friend of ours. You are welcome at my house anytime. To your home? Mmm-hmm. Well, that's a lovely invitation. I'll see you soon, Simon. (SIRENS WAILING) Elaine : I'm so happy you're here... At home. Mom, this... This can't happen again. Your, um... Your band manager seems... Nice. (SCOFFS) He's not. Trust me, he sucks. But I told him to put the tour on hold. From now on, I'm only doing local gigs. So does that mean you're moving home? I want to, yeah. But I just need to, you know... Get my stuff together. You promise? I promise. (SIGHS) God, I love you, monkey. I love you, too, Mom. Night, sweetie. You have to call off the pack. You're the alpha. They'll listen to you. It's not that easy. The pack operates by code, blood for blood. But it's not Jace's fault. He was tricked into kidnapping Gretel. It was Valentine who killed her. Believe me, I know his manipulations better than anybody, but that doesn't mean... Alaric : Luke. Give me a sec. Please... Maia's caught up to Jace. He's on Front Street heading towards the Brooklyn Bridge. That's near Magnus' loft. Yeah, not near enough. Sounds like she's moving in for the kill. What do you want to do? (WOLVES GROWLING) Maia : End of the line. (SOFTLY) So close. (SNARLING) And yet, so far. Gretel was our pack member. And she was my friend. You need to pay for what you did to her. I didn't kill her. (PANTING) Valentine used me, just like he's using you right now. Us fighting with each other is only giving him what he wants. Really? (WOLVES SNARLING) Give me one good reason why I should believe you. Because I know what it's like to lose someone you love. My brother is counting on me. Just... (SIGHS) You can kill me... Just please let me get to him first. (WOLVES GROWLING) Well, I wish I could, but, uh... It's them you'll have to convince. (SNARLS) Clary : Stop! Stand down! Keep out of this, Luke. Jace didn't kill Gretel. It was Valentine. I'm telling you the truth. I swear! (WOLF GROWLING) (WOLF YELPS) (SNARLS) (WOLF WHIMPERS) Stay. (WOLF GROWLING SOFTLY) Good doggy. By the order of the Clave, Jace Wayland is coming with me! Luke : Maia. (WOLF CONTINUES GROWLING) I said stand down. (SNARLING) (GROWLING SOFTLY) Thanks, Izzy. I owe you one. Don't thank me yet. (VEHICLES HONKING) Magnus : He can't last much longer. Alec. Where's Alec? Don't worry. He'll be here. Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee. Entreat me not to leave thee... Or to return from following after thee. (BREATHING HEAVILY) For whither thou goest, I will go. And where thou lodgest... (GASPS) (PANTS) What's happening? He's slipping. No... (WHEEZING) Thy people will be my people, thy God will be my God. When thou diest, I will die. And there will I be buried. The Angel do so to me. (EXHALES SLOWLY) (CRYING) And more also... If aught but death part thee and me. Please don't leave me, Alec. (SOBS SOFTLY) Alec : (WEAKLY) If aught but death part thee and me. (JACE CRYING) (ALEC SOBS SOFTLY) (CHUCKLES) Aldertree : Jace Wayland! You are hereby sentenced to the City of Bones to await trial for the charge of high treason and aiding Valentine in the war against the Clave. Wait, what... What the hell is going on? It's all right, Alec. All that matters is you're back.
