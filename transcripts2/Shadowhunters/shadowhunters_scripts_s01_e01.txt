 EIGHT HOURS EARLIER 
 [sighs] 
 Clary: Hi.[ sighs ] I'm Clary Fray. 
 This landscape is very... decorative. 
 Clary: Well, I wasn't really going for decorative, exactly. 
 What are those? 
 Clary: Oh, those. Nothing, just, um... [stammers] 
some ideas for a graphic novel I'm drawing with a friend. 
Really, it's just there by mistake. 
 The Brooklyn Academy of Art doesn't believe in mistakes. 
 Simon: Give me the professors' names and I... I will end them. 
You know, with... with a scathing e-mail to the dean. 
 Clary: Don't bother. 
 Simon: What? 
Sad face? Really? 
 [Clary laughs] 
 Simon: Well played, well played. 
 Clary: Thank you. You know, it's weird. 
They kind of liked my assigned work, but they flipped out over the drawings for our graphic novel. 
 Simon: You're welcome. [chuckles] 
 Clary: This day will go down in history as the greatest 18th birthday I ever had. 
 Simon: Which is why we are celebrating tonight. 
Yes, with Maureen, after our show. 
 Clary: Absolutely. So... what's the deal with you and Maureen? 
 Simon: What deal? No deal. We sing together. 
 Clary: You seriously don't know she's been crushing on you this whole time? 
 Simon: [stammering] What? No. No. 
 Clary: Simon, how can someone as smart and perceptive as you not realize that the person sitting right there is in love with you? 
 Simon: I guarantee you I'm not the only smart, perceptive person to make that mistake. 
 That's a latte. 
 Clary: But I could have sworn I had a biscotti. 
 Simon: Maybe you ate it really fast and didn't even notice. Happens to me all the time. When I'm happy... when I'm sad. 
 [Clary laughs] 
 Simon: But I will replace your mythical biscotti with an actual one. 
 Clary: Thank you. 
 Simon: You know what? Here's to you. L'chaim. 
 Clary: L'chaim. [chuckles] 
  ELSEWHERE  
 [horn blaring] 
 [dog barking] 
 Luke:  Same MO as the others? 
 Yeah, this one's drained of blood. 
 [whimpers] 
 This makes seven. 
 Yeah, not good. 
 Luke: Hey, Captain Vargas. 
 Vargas: Another body drained of blood? 
 We're thinking formalin pump. 
 Alaric and I are chasing down a bunch of leads. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Vargas: You know she can tell when you decline a call, right? 
 Luke: Yep. 
 Vargas: I need you to do something for me. 
 Luke: What? Catch these guys? 
 Vargas: Besides that. Marry Jocelyn. What are you waiting for? 
 Luke: Me and Jocelyn, we're... we're different. [cell phone ringing] It's for Clary's birthday. [phone beeps] 
 Vargas: You're already acting like a husband, go be one. 
 FRAY HOUSEHOLD 
 Clary: Hey, Dot. 
 Dot: Hey! 
 Clary: How's your future looking? 
 Dot: Not as good as yours.Hmm. The tarot cards tell me you got into the advanced program. 
 Clary: And by "the tarot cards," you mean, "Simon's Twitter account"? 
 Dot: [chuckles] Okay, I follow him. 
 Mmm. 
 Dot: Turns out, predicting the future with tarot cards is very complicated. But, I do see a birthday present in your future. 
 Clary: Dot! 
 Dot: [chuckles] Okay, open it! 
 Clary: Wow! 
 Dot: Yeah, you might want to keep that on the DL, 'cause your mom's my boss and I don't want her to flip out. 
 Clary: Yeah, but that's how I know it's cool. 
 [both chuckle] 
 Clary: You know, you're way better at gift-giving than magically predicting the future. 
 Dot: Nothing magical about it. I just buy the things I wanna wear. Happy birthday. 
 Clary: Thank you. 
 Dot: I love you, Clary. 
 Clary: I love you, too. [sighs deeply] 
 Dot: You okay? 
 Clary: Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, happy birthday. 
 Dot: Go up and see your mom. 
 Clary: Mom! 
 You did it! Yay! [laughs] 
 You also follow Simon? 
 He only has 92 followers. 
 He needs the retweets. Congratulations. 
 [chuckles] 
 Thank you. Hashtag, stalker mom. 
 Happy birthday. 
 It's called a stele. 
 What is it, like, a paperweight? 
 No, it's much more than that. 
 It's very ancient. 
 I want you to have it. 
 It's a family heirloom. 
 [chuckles] We Frays have heirlooms? 
 A few. 
 You know, it's weird. 
 I doodled something that looked like this this morning. 
 I must have seen this around the house somewhere. 
 Honey, I need to... 
 [cell phone chimes] 
 Simon. He's on his way over. 
 But we need to talk. 
 I can't right now. I gotta change. 
 I'm going to see Champagne Enema tonight. 
 What? 
 Yeah, I know. It's the new band name. 
 But Simon and Maureen are taking me out after. 
 But it's... It's your 18th birthday, and, uh... [inhales deeply] everything's gonna change for you now. 
 Mom, we've had the talk. I'm good. 
 We need to have a much different and more important talk. 
 And we will. 
 But can it be over breakfast, all right? 
 I love you. 
 Thank you for the heirloom. 
 I love you. 
 [exhales] 
 [sighs] 
 Your daughter looks just like you. 
 It's the hair. 
 [croaks] 
 [roaring] 
 [panting] 
 [growls] 
 [Jocelyn yells] 
 [gasps] 
 Come on. 
 Magnus! 
 Please, Magnus, only a warlock can do this. 
 Mom? 
 It's okay, honey. It's for the best. 
 You're not protecting her, you're deceiving her. 
 For as long as possible. 
 She won't be a child forever, Jocelyn. 
 For now, I don't want her part of our world. 
 Mom, I don't wanna do this. 
 Please, take her memories. 
 Hey, sorry I'm late. Captain's got me on those demonic murders. 
 Look at the drawings. 
 [sighs] 
 It's already happening. 
 We both knew this time was coming. We'll tell her together. 
 No, it was my choice. I'll do it alone. 
 All right. Well, do it soon. 
 And if she's unprepared, your life is in danger. 
 And so is Clary's. 
 Hey, Luke, what's up? 
 Hey! 
 Incredible drawings. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 And I got you these. 
 Spray paint. 
 Oh, they're perfect. 
 If I catch any of that paint on city walls, I will arrest you. 
 Clary: The paint is for Simon's van. I'm insisting they rename the band. 
 Oh, yes, please. 
 [b]Clary[/b]: Yeah. 
 Did your mom talk to you about that? 
 The heirloom. Yeah, it's beautiful. 
 Clary, you're 18 now, and... 
 What is with you guys? 
 I'm turning 18, it's not like I'm headed off on some epic journey. 
 [b]Simon[/b]: But you are! 
 See, we are going to Lombardi's to celebrate your birthday after our gig. 
 [chuckles] 
 You should come back here after. 
 The city's not that safe right now. 
 Ah, thanks, Mom, but we're set. 
 Yeah, we will take a rain check. 
 Wait. Do I smell chicken cacciatore? 
 Simon, your gig. 
 Oh, you're singing? 
 Yes, big gig. 
 And by big, I mean not so. 
 [chuckles] 
 [chokes] Losing circulation here. 
 Breakfast, you and me, tomorrow. 
 Promise? 
 Yep. 
 [b]Clary[/b]: Mom... uh, Mom? 
 Mom, you have to let me go. I'm biologically and legally an adult. 
 Yeah. 
 That's what I'm afraid of. 
 Shall we? 
 Yes. 
 Just let her be a kid for one last day. 
 Okay. 
 [b]Clary[/b]: [i]My mom is so overprotective lately.[/i] 
 [chuckles] 
 Simon: So, do you remember in [i]Aliens,[/i] when the alien queen was defending her eggs from Ripley? 
 Clary: In this scenario, is my mom Ripley or the alien queen? 
 Simon: Both. 
 What? 
 Clary: A mother defending her young. 
 Clary: Defending me from what? I spend all day in an art studio. My life couldn't be more mundane. Besides, I really don't know much about when she was young. 
 Maureen: Oh, just do what I do and get all the dirt from your relatives. 
 Clary: [scoffs] Well, I would if I could, but she doesn't have any. And my... my dad died before I was born. 
 So, you have no one? 
 No uncles, no aunts, no third cousins, twice removed? 
 Clary: No, just me and my mom. 
 It's why the Lewis clan has added three chairs to every seder since pre-school. 
 Mmm. 
 One for Clary, one for Jocelyn, and one for Elijah. 
 Of course. Obviously. 
 Yes, obviously. 
 Maureen: You guys don't think that's a little bit suspicious? You not knowing anything about your family? Your mom could be hiding some deep, dark secret. 
 Clary: Maureen, it's not possible. 
 Maureen: No, no, think about it. 
 Clary: No, seriously. My mother is incapable of concealing anything from me. 
 [b]Alec[/b]: Isabelle, let's go. 
 Izzy: Hey, there, big bro. 
 Alec: Really? 
 Izzy: What can I say? Demons dig blondes. 
 Alec: Of course they do, but that's white. 
 Izzy: Platinum. And they don't exactly like Shakespeare, okay, Alec? 
 Alec: You're plenty distracting on your own. 
 Izzy: [sighs] So, be yourself. Is that what you're trying to say? 
 Alec: Never mind. Looking good, let's go. We're ready, Jace. 
 Jace: Nice choice, Izzy. Demons dig blondes. 
 [b]Izzy[/b]: Told you. 
 [b]Alec[/b]: It's platinum. 
 Jace: All right, guys, for some reason our demon friends are killing mundanes and draining their blood. 
 Alec: Why do they want blood? Isn't that vampire territory? 
 Jace: I don't know, Alec. 
 Lazy vampires, maybe? 
 [sighs] There must be something special about their blood. 
 What could be special about mundane blood? 
 Izzy: You get me a sample and I'll tell you exactly what they're looking for. 
 We'll have more answers when we figure out exactly who the demons are working for. 
 So, you don't think they're acting on their own? 
 No. 
 They're not exactly creative thinkers, they're shapeshifters. 
 This is what our target looks like. 
 [b]Isabelle[/b]: For now. 
 Alec: Great. I'll get approval for the mission. 
 Jace: Come on, Alec. By the time you've sent that message, we'll have killed six demons. 
 Izzy: Besides, it's more fun to break the rules than to follow them.

 [audience applauding] 
 Whoo! 
 [b]Maureen[/b]: Thanks for being our roadie. 
 Yeah, and thank you for being our artist in residence. 
 Of course. 
 So, you went on stage tonight as Champagne Enema. 
 [both laugh] 
 What were we thinking, right? 
 But now... we're Rock Solid Panda. 
 Yeah, we are. 
 Clary: Rock Solid Panda, coming up. I'm feeling inspired. 
 Paint. 
 Paint. 
 [Clary gasps] 
 What's that tag? 
 Clary: Weird, I didn't even mean to draw that. Second time today. 
 You know they have confirmed cases of people waking up in the morning speaking French, and they never even studied the language. 
 Do you think that's some kind of language? 
 Sanskrit maybe. 
 Clary: Hey, can you watch where you're going? 
 Jace: You can see me? 
 Clary: Yeah, that's kind of the point, but you obviously didn't see me. 
 Jace: You have the Sight. 
 Clary: Wait, the what? 
 Jace: How can I not know who you are? 
 Clary: Has that line seriously ever worked for you? Even once? 
 [b]Alec[/b]: Jace! 
 Clary: Can you guys believe that blonde dude? 
 You mean the imaginary dude you were talking to? 
 [b]Clary[/b]: No, the guy right there, running into the club. 
 [b]Maureen[/b]: Clary, there's nobody there. 
 Clary: The guy covered in tats, like... [stammers] 
 What guy are you talking about? 
 Clary: You guys seriously don't see him? 
 No. 
 Clary: Okay, could you stop making me feel insane? 
 Maureen: Could you stop acting that way? 
 Clary, what was in your latte? 
 Where you going? 
 Clary: To get some answers. 
 Remember, your fake ID sucks.

 Clary: And then these creepy tentacles seemed to come out of the body builder's face, and... and then the guy just... vaporized. 
 [trembling] I mean, I was drugged, right? 
 Jocelyn: What did the markings look like on the blonde boy you were talking about? 
 Clary: Who cares, Mom, okay? Are you even listening to me? I think I killed a guy. 
 Jocelyn: Clary... did they look like this? 
 Clary: Mom, what the... 
 Jocelyn: Everything you saw tonight has a meaning and an explanation, and I've dreaded having this conversation with you since the day you were born. 
 Clary: What is going on? [stammers] Am I going insane? 
 Jocelyn: No, you're not. But the protections are wearing off. You're 18 now, and you need to know the truth. 
 Clary: Protections? What does that even mean? Mom, you... Mom, you're scaring the hell out of me. 
 Jocelyn: I know, and that's why I've put this off until the last possible minute. 
 Dot: Jocelyn, look out the window. Magnus called to warn us. They found you. 
 Jocelyn: Dot, it's time. 
 Okay, listen to me. You cannot be near me. 
 What's happening? 
 Jocelyn: I got a very powerful person angry. 
 Clary: What did you do? 
 Jocelyn: I hid something from him and his followers. 
 Clary: Followers? Why can't we just call the police? 
 Jocelyn: The policeman you need to call is Luke. Keep this with you and think of me when you wear it. 
 Clary: Mom, this is not the time for more birthday gifts. 
 What the hell is happening? 
 Only if you need it. 
 Trust your instincts. You're more powerful than you know. 
 [tires screech] 
 Take Jocelyn alive. 
 Find the Mortal Cup. 
 Mom, I need to understand what's... 
 Dot, open it. 
 Everything I've done, every mistake I've made was because I love you more than words. 
 What are you doing? 
 Jocelyn: Luke will explain everything. He'll hide you. 
 Clary: Hide me? 
 Jocelyn: From the Circle. He's the only one you can trust. Trust no one else. 
 Clary: Mom, I don't... 
 Where's Luke now? 
 At the police station! 
 Remember, I love you. 
 Mom! Mom! 
 [air whooshing] 
 Clary! 
 Mom! 
 [energy pulsating] 
 [yelps] 
 [panting] Ow. 
 Vargas: Clary? 
 Clary: Captain Vargas. 
 Vargas: It's 2:00 in the morning. What are you doing here so late? 
 Clary: Uh, um... Luke said he'd, uh, drive me home if he was still here. 
 Vargus: Still doesn't trust those cabbies, huh? Well, he's in the middle of an interview. It could take a while. 
 Clary: [stammers] Cool, I'll wait in the cafeteria. 
 Vargus: Hey, uh... is there some sort of problem? Guy trouble? 
 Clary: Yeah, sure. Guy trouble, it's, uh... something like that. 
 [grunts] 
 [grunting] 
 [grunts] 
 I won't let them find you. 
 [grunting] 
 [yells] This could all be over if you just turn over the Mortal Cup. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 After all these years, you're still after it? 
 [scoffs] It's not for us. 
 It's for him. 
 Valentine's still alive. 
 He'll be pretty surprised to see that you are, too. 
 I won't let Valentine create an army. 
 You once believed in him. 
 I believed in protecting humankind. 
 You'll never get the Cup. 
 No! 
 [thunder rumbling] 
 [b]man[/b]: The minute we found out Jocelyn Fairchild was alive, you were easy to track. 
 Fairchild? 
 Turns out you and Jocelyn were never that far apart. 
 The Circle has her now. 
 It's just a matter of time until we catch the daughter. 
 You can have them both if you give up the Mortal Cup. 
 Luke: I don't care about either of them. They mean nothing to me. 
 [gasps] 
 [b]Luke[/b]: Kill them both if you like. My people want the Cup. Why do you think I've been hanging around here all these years? Now, when I find the Cup... I'm gonna keep it. And you can tell Valentine and the Circle that. 
 No one mentioned Valentine. 
 Luke: You didn't have to. 
 Listen to me. 
 Luke: No, you listen to me. Get out of my office. 
 [breathing heavily] Mom... Mom... 
 [creatures growling] 
 [energy pulsating] 
 [Valentine sighs] 
 [b]Valentine[/b]: You've returned. 
 I'm so sorry it had to be this way, Jocelyn. 
 [breathes deeply] 
 I told you to bring her back unharmed. 
 What happened? 
 A potion. 
 She must have been under the protection of a warlock. 
 She was in league with the Downworlder, hiding amongst the mundane. 
 Coward. 
 Jocelyn Fairchild was able to hide from the Circle for 18 years. 
 Do you think a coward is capable of something like that? 
 The only thing she's capable of is smelling like a mundane. 
 I'm sorry? 
 She betrayed the Circle. 
 She doesn't deserve our respect. 
 [flesh searing] 
 [groaning] 
 [screaming] 
 Mom! Mom! 
 [gasps] 
 Mom! [panting] 
 [crying] Mom...

 [wailing] 
 [breathing deeply] 
 [thunder rumbling] 
 [thunder rumbles] 
 [gasps] 
 [gasps] 
 Dot. 
 They took Jocelyn. 
 Who took her? 
 Rogue Shadowhunters searching for the Mortal Cup. 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 Think, Clary. 
 Did your mother ever talk to you about a cup? 
 A very important cup. 
 [stuttering] It's gold, almost like a chalice. 
 No! No, I don't know anything about a cup, Dot. 
 [stammers] One of the antiquities downstairs? 
 No, no, not those. 
 [inhales deeply] Think, Clary. This could save Jocelyn. 
 I can't think! Someone kidnapped my mother! 
 You know more than you think you do, Clary Fray. 
 [screeching] 
 [Clary grunts and groans] 
 [Dot growling] 
 [screeches] 
 [exclaims] 
 [growls] 
 [Clary gasps] 
 [crying] 
 [screeches] 
 [gasps] 
 What, no "thank you" for saving your life? 
 Careful. That demon got a piece of you. 
 Demons? 
 Yeah. 
 What do you think that miserable, disgusting thing was? 
 I, uh... I thought it was Dot. 
 [voice echoes] No, Ravener demon, shapeshifter. 
 [sighs] You're just saying words now. 
 [pants] Why... why is the room swirling? 
 Demon venom. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 It's that bad? 
 I got you. 
 [low humming] 
 [muttering] 
 [b]Valentine[/b]: Jocelyn, you're back with me. 
 [moaning] 
 [gasps] 
 [smacks head] 
 Ow. 
 [sighs] 
 Wait, I don't know who you... 
 I'm Isabelle. 
 I've never seen Jace so curious about a mundane... or distracted. 
 Like you saw earlier, distractions are dangerous in our line of work. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Who's Jace? 
 You really don't know much, do you? 
 All I know is some psychos took my mother, and now you people have taken me. 
 [chuckles] And by "taken" I assume you mean "saved your life"? 
 [b]Alec[/b]: A mundane shouldn't even be here. 
 Where is "here" exactly? 
 She's not a mundane, Alec. 
 How do you know that? 
 Because the seraph blade lit up when she touched it. 
 Look, Isabelle, can you... 
 [sighs] I'm Jace Wayland. 
 I'm, uh... 
 Clary Fray, we know who you are. 
 Am I the only one who finds this unusual? 
 You find everything unusual, Alec. 
 [b]Alec[/b]: I have to report this to the Clave. 
 [b]Jace[/b]: You know what? Dial it down a notch. 
 [b]Isabelle[/b]: My brother doesn't have a dial. 
 I love you, Alec, but you have a switch that's always on. 
 I love you, too. But this... 
 Hey, you know what? Give me a minute. 
 Here's a word you never hear me say. Please? 
 What is with you? 
 Really, no, what is with him? 
 Walk with me, big brother. 
 I'll explain it to you. 
 We don't know this girl. 
 There's no such thing as new Shadowhunters. 
 There is now. 
 You don't find that strange? 
 What I find strange is that you're so upset. 
 Maybe you're upset by the way Jace is looking at her. [chuckles] 
 You know, you should be happy that Jace is interested in someone other than himself. 
 Maybe I'm pissed that she's ruined the mission. 
 We never found out who's buying the blood. 
 That was our one job. 
 Your wound, it's healed. 
 How is that even possible? 
 So, what, I'm miraculously healed, and all of you... stunning people have magical powers? 
 [scoffs] No. No, don't confuse me with a warlock. 
 A what? 
 A warlock. 
 It's one of the Downworlders. 
 Okay, you're not making any sense. 
 Warlocks, vampires, Seelies... 
 Literally my brain is about to explode. 
 Jeez, all right. Well, I'll keep it simple for you. 
 All the legends are true. 
 We're Shadowhunters. 
 We protect the human world from the demon world. 
 So those people you saw murdered at the Pandemonium, they weren't people at all, they were shapeshifting demons. 
 I'm not interested in being a part of your supernatural fight club. 
 I just wanna find my mom. 
 [voice breaking] The rest of it, whatever it is, all I care about is finding my mother. 
 [softly] Please. 
 Please help me find her. 
 I'm the best chance you've got. 
 I don't even know you. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Simon. 
 How come you haven't answered your phone in two days? 
 Things are... all ripped apart. 
 Where are you? 
 Find My Friends says your phone is in an abandoned church on Deighton. 
 I'm outside. 
 [exhales] I see you. 
 I don't see you. 
 Give me five minutes. I have to get dressed. 
 [b]Simon[/b]: [i]Dressed? What are you doing undressed in an abandoned church?[/i] 
 Clary, is there... Is there a meth problem we have to talk about? 
 Simon, just give me five minutes, okay? 
 Um, what, uh... What happened to my clothes? 
 Demon venom. 
 Remember? 
 Isabelle left you these. 
 [chuckles] 
 You're kidding, right? 
 She's very comfortable with her body. 
 Okay. 
 [huffs] 
 How did that get there? 
 I drew that. 
 Okay, listen. 
 I still don't get everything that's going on here, but you do not tattoo my neck. 
 That's creepy. 
 Duly noted. I guess next time I'll just let you die. 
 And it's not a tattoo. 
 It's a rune. 
 They have enormous power. 
 Good for Shadowhunters. 
 Lethal for humans. 
 But you, you already know all about runes, don't you? 
 Maybe you don't. 
 Which is what makes you so interesting... 
 Clary Fray. 
 I saw something... behind your friend. 
 You're not gonna kill Simon, are you? 
 Protect the humans, kill the demons. You'll get it eventually. 
 [door opens] 
 So, why can't Simon see you? 
 This is a glamour, a rune that makes me invisible to mundanes. 
 It's a shame, really, 'cause... well, denying them all this. 
 What do you have on, Clary? 
 Let me take you home. 
 I don't think I have one anymore. 
 Why? What do you mean? 
 Well... 
 [b]man[/b]: Clary Fairchild! 
 [gasps] 
 Clary, what's going on? 
 What are you looking at? 
 If you give us the girl, I'll let you live. 
 You're in no position to be making rules. 
 [Jace grunts] 
 [Clary gasps] 
 Clary... 
 [yelps] 
 [both grunting] 
 [strained] We'll never stop hunting her. 
 This is for my father. 
 [gasps] 
 [panting] 
 Jace! 
 Excuse me? 
 Is he dead? 
 Is who dead? 
 What the... 
 Could you deglamourize, or whatever, so my best friend doesn't think I'm losing my mind? 
 Um... what is happening? 
 Yeah, we don't have the luxury right now, kid. Everyone back inside. 
 Clary, who is this? Your meth dealer? 
 I've seen him before. At the police station. 
 He's a member of the Circle. Clary, he's here for you. 
 He's with the people who took my mother. 
 Right, your little best friend here led him right to you. 
 He's here to capture or kill you. 
 There's a dead body there, we have to call Luke. 
 We can't trust Luke, Simon. We can't. 
 Clary, I need to keep you safe. 
 I promise you, I promise I am gonna help you find your mother. 
 But you're one of us. You're a Shadowhunter. 
 [b]Simon[/b]: What are you talking about? 
 Clary... you don't know this guy, all right? 
 Come with me. I can get us help. 
 Clary, please. 
 Clary, come on. 
 I don't see the Mortal Cup! 
 We searched. 
 It's not in the loft. 
 Just because you couldn't find it doesn't mean it isn't there. 
 There's a daughter. 
 [stammering] It looks just like Jocelyn. 
 There's no sign of the father. 
 Could be a mundane. 
 Jocelyn has a daughter? 
 [inhales] 
 Well, in that case, I'd like to speak to Jocelyn's daughter.
