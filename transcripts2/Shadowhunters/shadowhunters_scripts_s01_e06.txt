 There's a box. It belonged to my father. Let's go get it. 
 Jace :  Previously on  Shadowhunters... 
 Is this the box you remember? 
 I don't know what any of this is. 
 Alaric! 
 Damn it, Alec. Clary snuck out of the Institute. 
 I don't know where they took her. 
 What did you do? 
 You just need to tell us where the Mortal Cup is. 
 I don't know where it is. 
 Would you like to go out for a drink sometime? 
 You know, now's not really a good time for me. 
 I love a challenge. 
 Simon! 
 Get your hands off me! Clary! 
 I finally found you, Clary. 
 That's the alpha leader. 
 [werewolf whimpering] 
 What's happening? 
 When a werewolf kills the alpha leader, he becomes the new alpha. 
 Your friend Luke's the leader of the pack now. 
 Oh, my God! We have to get him to Magnus. 
 That's exactly what we're gonna do. 
 [Luke groaning] 
 What happened? 
 Simon : He was attacked! 
 Clary : He needs a warlock. 
 [panting] He needs you. 
 [Luke groans] 
 Magnus : Put him here. 
 Luke mutters : Where are you? 
 Clary : Luke... 
 Luke : I can't find you. 
 [shushing] 
 Where are... where are you? 
 Where are you? 
 Luke : Jocelyn! 
 Where are you? 
 Jocelyn! 
 Jocelyn! 
 [panting] 
 Where are you? 
 Jocelyn : Where I always was. 
 I missed you. 
 I'm here now. 
 I've been waiting for you. 
 But I can't stay. 
 Why? 
 You know why. 
 Tell me how to get you back. 
 Clary's the key. 
 You have to help her. 
 You have to unlock her. 
 Tell her everything. 
 I can't. 
 You have to, or she'll never find the Cup. 
 She has to find the Cup. 
 To save you? 
 No. To stop Valentine. 
 Jocelyn! 
 Help her. 
 Wait! 
 [panting] Jocelyn! 
 Jocelyn... 
 No, Luke, it's Clary. Can you hear me? 
 Clary, listen to me. 
 Listen... You have to listen to me. 
 I have to tell you, just in case... 
 No, don't even say it, don't. 
 No, listen to me. 
 Luke. 
 No, you need to know! Listen... 
 Was he bitten by an alpha? 
 Yeah, why? 
 Three, two, one... 
 [growls] 
 Clary : Oh, my God. 
 [yelling] 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 Hold him down. 
 [groaning] 
 We don't have a lot of time. 
 It'll take a few moments to take effect. 
 What's happening to him? 
 Random werewolf transformation. 
 It's a side effect of the poison in the alpha bite. 
 [grunting] 
 You're sure the Seelies think Valentine killed their scouts? 
 It's why they've broken off contact with the Clave. 
 They're considering switching sides. 
 That's totally irrational. 
 It's self-preservation. 
 They think Valentine can win. 
 Seelies always want to be on the winning side. 
 Never trust a people who can't lie. 
 They find much more inventive ways to stab you in the back. 
 [sighing] I suppose you find that attractive. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 You okay? 
 Hey... it's me. 
 I know how much he means to you. 
 How could I have doubted him? 
 Simon, he's... He's the only father I've ever known. 
 [stammers] I can't lose him. 
 I get a good vibe from this Magnus Bane guy. 
 He seems like he knows what he's doing. 
 The bark will stop the transformation for now, but Luke needs an antidote to stop the poison in his system. 
 And I don't have all the ingredients here. 
 Just tell me what you need and how to get it. 
 No, you stay here. 
 Luke will need you if he wakes up. 
 When he wakes up. 
 I'll go. 
 I'll go. 
 Jace, what happened to you? 
 Luke's car may have found its way into a pole while I was stashing it. 
 I don't do mundane driving. 
 Yeah, apparently. 
 What do you need for the antidote? 
 Hey, I got this. 
 Phoenix eyes, moon salt, and Idris fulgurite. 
 One trip to the pharmacy, it'll take two seconds. 
 I know a guy. 
 And, uh... I don't need him. 
 Too bad. You're getting me. 
 We'll be right back. 
 One more thing. 
 I need Alexander. 
 Uh, why do you need Alec? 
 Virgin Shadowhunter energy. 
 [scoffs] That explains so much. 
 [clears throat] Um, Alec, yeah... 
 I can't. 
 Jace, just ask, please. 
 You guys need to talk. 
 [sighs] 
 Trouble in paradise? 
 Jace : Just don't speak to me. 
 [sighs] 
 Mom's in rare form today. 
 She's been different since she got back from Idris. 
 If you say so. 
 Same old judgmental Mom with me. 
 [inhales] Have you spoken to Jace yet? 
 He can call me when he's done chasing the little girl and... 
 Alec, you need to call Jace. 
 Robert : No "welcome home" for the old man? 
 Alec : Max! 
 Isabelle : Daddy! 
 What are you doing back so soon? 
 Got in trouble in Mumbai. 
 Oh, what'd you do? 
 Nothing. 
 He started a fire with his stele during rune studies. 
 [chuckles] Max. 
 I told you, I was hungry. 
 [Isabelle chuckles] 
 I was trying to draw the Nourishment rune. 
 Those two runes look nothing alike, Max. 
 Well, they do to me. 
 Max, go up to your room, open the Gray Book and look up the Extinguish rune. 
 [sighs] 
 [Robert sighs] 
 Where is Clary Fairchild? 
 Your mother said she's missing. 
 She's not missing. She's with Jace. 
 We can't have that girl out of Institute control. 
 The entire Shadow World is looking for her. 
 It's a security risk. Get them both back here now. 
 You need to get back to the Institute. 
 You need to help me first. 
 No, I'm not messing around. 
 Me either. 
 I need your help. 
 You okay? 
 I'm fine. It's Magnus. 
 He needs your powerful Shadowhunter energy, or something like that. 
 Magnus... [stammers] Why does Magnus need me? 
 To help save Luke's life. 
 No, I told you at the wolf den, no more Downworlder business. 
 We can't be seen as interfering with a pack alpha dispute. 
 How can you even ask me... 
 I shouldn't have to ask you, Alec. 
 We're  parabatai. 
 That's exactly my point. 
 Alec, you're a man of honor,  and the only person in the world I would trust with something like this. 
 I'm counting on you to do the right thing. 
 [sighs] 
 What's all this for? 
 The base for the potion. 
 [Clary exclaims] 
 Stir. 
 We need to have it ready before your boy toys get back. 
 What if they don't get back in time? 
 You can't think like that, biscuit. 
 That's all I can think about. 
 [scoffs] 
 Magnus, I don't know if I can do this anymore. 
 Okay, I'm an art student. 
 All my adventures are supposed to be two-dimensional. 
 Who says? 
 Me. 
 Look, it is one thing to draw monsters and demons, but it is completely different to see them up close and personal. 
 I don't know what I'm doing. 
 Don't sell yourself short. 
 You forget, I've seen you in action, Clary Fairchild. 
 Jocelyn! No, don't... don't... 
 [stammers] Wait, don't touch her. 
 Luke, I'm here. I'm here. [shushing] 
 Let me take your pain away. 
 [gasping] No. No. 
 Agitation only makes the venom work faster. 
 I need to tell Clary. 
 Save your strength. 
 No, you need to know. No, please. 
 Magnus, do it. 
 [groaning] You need to tell her, all of it. 
 [grunts] Promise me. 
 [Luke breathes heavily] 
 [snaps fingers] 
 [grunting] 
 The poison is spreading. 
 [Luke grunting] 
 Your suitors need to hurry. 
 Jace : Keep up, mundane. 
 Simon : Would you stop calling me that? I have a name. 
 Well, learning it would mean I care, so, no. 
 Yeah, and God forbid you care about anyone but yourself. 
 I care about a bunch of people. 
 Just don't care about you. 
 Me, or what... What's it called, your... your  parabatais? 
 Whoa, watch your mouth. 
 You don't know a thing about me and Alec. 
 We clear? 
 Twenty bucks says he leaves you hanging tonight. 
 Not a chance. 
 Really? 
 "Come, fetch, roll over." You know, "Lie down." 
 You treat him like a lap dog. 
 Guess it takes one to know one. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 It means, you're like a yippy dog nipping at Clary's heels. 
 I don't nip. And she's my best friend. 
 That's all she's ever gonna be. 
 Have you seriously not figured that out yet? 
 Look, I don't want Clary as anything more than a best friend. 
 Right. 
 And I'll have you know that there are tons of women who have more-than-a-friend feelings for me. 
 Where are they? 
 I don't have to introduce you to them. 
 And my point is, Clary and I have always had each other's backs. 
 We had our entire lives. 
 That's more than I can say for you or Alec. 
 You do not get to talk about Alec, mundane. 
 I told you, don't call me mundane! 
 Are we clear? 
 [breathing heavily] 
 What are you gonna do now? 
 You gonna cut me? 
 [Simon grunts] 
 Do that again, and I'll kick your ass. 
 [shuddering] I'm sorry. Dude, I'm sorry. 
 I don't know why I did that. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What happened to you at the vampire hotel? 
 Nothing. I told you, I was a hostage. 
 You sure? 
 Leave me alone! 
 I told you, it's nothing, it's... 
 You just piss me off. 
 Mother. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Did something happen in Idris? 
 Nothing we can do about it now. 
 There's always something we can do. 
 You taught me that. 
 Do you remember when I was ten? 
 And there was that kid, Preston, who kept beating the crap out of me in kendo training? 
 You had perfect form, perfect technique. 
 That was what was holding me back. 
 You said I needed to mess it up, break form, do something he wouldn't expect. 
 It went against every fiber of my training... but I adapted. 
 I was so proud when you broke his nose. 
 Until his mother yelled at you, and insisted I be punished for insubordination. 
 That just made me prouder. 
 The way you took it. 
 I knew it had to be done. 
 We can figure out a work-around for whatever the Clave is throwing at you. 
 Work-arounds can get messy, if you recall. 
 We're Lightwoods. 
 We break noses and accept the consequences. 
 Tell me what you need me to do. 
 Tell me what? 
 What's so important that Luke risked his life? 
 Everything Jocelyn hoped to hide from you. 
 Why? 
 [sighs] When you were younger, I'd watch you sketching. 
 It was your bliss. 
 You're gonna need some bliss now. 
 Back then, there wasn't a day I didn't draw. 
 It was like breathing. 
 Now, I look at this blank page and I barely even know what to do. 
 Sometimes I feel like my art, my memories... 
 My life, it... it all vanished with that Memory Demon. 
 Your art, everything you are... they're all still here. 
 You're the woman your mother always knew you could be. 
 But tried to keep me from being. 
 That's why you need to know how you got here. 
 Will it help me find my mother? 
 That's the only reason I can think of why Luke would be so adamant. 
 [sighs] 
 I'm ready. 
 Bring it, warlock. 
 Magnus : When I first heard about your father, around the time he and Jocelyn first got together, long before the Uprising and the Circle, Valentine elevated the Morgenstern name to be synonymous with virtue. 
 Defenders of the Accords, allies to the Downworld. 
 This is who we are! 
 Magnus :  And your mother was at his side. 
 We must never violate our oath. 
 Because this is our sacred duty. 
 Magnus :  But by the time my people came to know him, barely two years later...  his name had become synonymous with devastation. 
 Your mother told me it was then she first saw the signs. 
 Val... 
 Are you hurt? 
 Talk to me. Whose blood is this? 
 Warlocks. 
 They attacked you? Where? When? 
 You've broken the Accords. 
 I'll talk to my father. 
 He knows the Law better than anyone. 
 Sometimes it isn't clear who instigated the fight. 
 The Accords are a fallacy. 
 Everything about them, down to the blasphemous magic that binds us all to their stupidity. 
 The Accords guarantee peace. 
 We are Shadowhunters. 
 We don't make peace with demons. 
 Downworlders are half human. 
 And half demon! Shadowhunters kill demons. 
 I'm fulfilling our destiny. 
 Magnus : They never found all the bodies. 
 We'd all stood with the Clave for centuries. 
 How could that not matter to him? 
 He was obsessed with ensuring purity of blood. 
 Convinced that the impurities were a threat to peace. 
 He was the threat to peace. 
 Mad men rarely make sense. 
 Mostly, they just hate. 
 And he hated the Downworlders, for the gifts that we possess that he could not have. 
 He hated us enough to kill us all. 
 Maryse : It's not like Isabelle can do it. 
 Robert : You're too hard on her. 
 And you're too soft on her. 
 It has to be Alec. He'll adapt. 
 Adapt to what? 
 It's not your concern. 
 Maryse, this is a family decision. 
 This is our only option. 
 Get on board, Robert! 
 She's been like that all day. 
 [sighs] 
 What's going on? 
 [laughs softly] 
 You know, ever since you were little, this has been my favorite part of coming home. 
 Why? 
 Just to see your face like that. 
 [laughs] 
 You trying to tell me something? 
 No, not at all. 
 You're perfect. 
 [chuckles] 
 I love it. 
 But I'm still gonna ask you what that was about. 
 If the Seelies change sides, we have no hope of defeating Valentine. 
 There has to be something we can do. 
 You know the Seelies better than anyone. 
 I'm not judging you. 
 It's a fact. It's an asset. 
 You and I need to convince the Clave of what's coming. 
 But... after all the unsanctioned missions that your brother authorized while we were away... 
 Alec was protecting Clary. 
 We all were. That's what the Clave wanted. 
 You went rogue. 
 And now the Clave thinks our family honor is beyond repair. 
 The Lightwood name only has meaning because of all the people who have fought for our cause, we were among the bravest. 
 The best of the Shadowhunters. 
 And now they think we're not anymore. 
 We'll do better. 
 Jace, Alec, and I, we'll restore the family name and our honor. 
 Then you need to understand the honor comes from the deed. 
 It's not a simple proposition to restore it. 
 It's gonna require a tremendous sacrifice. 
 Ever since my mother was kidnapped, and the Shadow World invaded my life, so many Downworlders have helped me, not even thinking about what it might cost them. 
 How could Valentine not see good in any of them? 
 He was blinded by his ambition. 
 Why didn't the Clave stop him? 
 [sighs] He was clever. 
 He and his followers, they managed to convince the Clave that the Downworlders they killed on their special missions had violated the Accords in some way. 
 Complete fabrications. 
 How could the Clave not see? 
 Shadowhunters believe in the Law as absolute. 
 They could never conceive of one of their own going astray. 
 [laughs] 
 My father didn't go astray, Magnus. 
 He went insane. 
 What happened back then is happening again. 
 The Clave refuses to believe that Valentine's a threat. 
 Nineteen years ago, their lack of vision allowed the Circle to almost decimate the entire Shadow World. 
 That was the Uprising? 
 Yes. 
 Valentine wanted to create a new Shadowhunter army. 
 And for that, he needed the Mortal Cup. 
 He knew it would be on display at the signing of the Accords as a show of the Clave's power. 
 
 [blades clanging] [grunting] [groans] [both grunting] Magnus :  He seized the opportunity to accomplish everything he ever wanted. Destroy the Accords, murder Downworlders, and secure the Cup. [electricity crackling] How could my mom and Luke be a part of something like this? Jocelyn and Luke tried to prevent the Uprising. They tried to change Valentine's mind about Downworlders. Obviously, they didn't. Clary, if it wasn't for your mother and Luke, the Circle would have won. [grunts] [both grunting] [grunting] [blade ringing] [yelling] No! [groans] [groans] [blade ringing] [panting] Ever since I found out Valentine was my father, I wondered how my mother could be married to someone like that... and why she stayed. She had to stop him. And safeguard the Cup. Everything Jocelyn did, she did to save the people she'd sworn to protect. She took her oath as a Shadowhunter seriously. I understand, but how does that help me find the Cup? Maybe Luke thinks if you know your mother better, you'll know where she hid it. Then, tell me why she gave up being a Shadowhunter. Because the one thing in the world she loved more is you. She had to protect you. [sighs] From my father, the lunatic. [Luke grunting] Luke. Luke? The magic's wearing off. It was our fault. It was our fault! [groaning loudly] Luke! [gasps] It's worse. Promise me you won't go through with it. Promise me you'll say no. What are you talking about? Say no to what? They're gonna make you marry. [scoffs] Who's they? Our parents are making plans for both of us. No, you heard wrong. [grunting] It's true, Alec. They need a political alliance quickly to restore our family name and our influence at the Clave. [scoffs] I knew Clary Fray would come back to bite me in the ass. So wait, when I'm getting married, what are you doing? They need me to convince the Clave to placate the Seelies somehow. You're playing the diplomat? Again? That's my job. That's what I'm supposed to be doing! I know that. But I'm the one with ties to the Seelies. [scoffs] Is that what you're calling it now? Alec, I'm on your side. Really? I have followed every rule. I've given up everything! We'll find a way out of this. [scoffs] Screw the rules. Screw them. Screw all of this. Alec. So is this where you kill me and dispose of the body in some ditch where no one will find me? Tell me again. What does Clary see in you? My inner compassion. Something you're sorely lacking. You don't really need compassion when you can get by on charm and good looks. And you wonder what she sees in me. What are we doing here? My black market dealer operates out of this building. Cozy. Downworlder, I'm assuming? Hates mundanes. So you guys have something in common. Just, uh... hang back. I told Clary I'd get her what she needs to save Luke. I am not hanging back like some third wheel. You are a third wheel. And I wasn't asking. [faint fluttering] [clattering] Camille? [gasps] Jace : Run! [grunts] Come on, mundane. Clary will not be happy if I let you die. [snarling] [grunts] [rumbling] [Luke groaning] I'm running out of magic. Clary : What do I do? I can't leave him, but the potion stock still needs Komodo scale. Find it, add the rest when they get here. You'll have to feed it to Luke. What about you? I'll hold on as long as I can. Go! [grunting] [Luke groaning] [panting] Help me. I need your strength. Take what you need. [Luke grunting loudly] [rumbling continues] both : Clary! Clary : Do you have it? Yeah. [panting] Thanks. [groans] [rumbling stops] [sighs] [Clary laughs softly] [softly] Hey... Clary. [breathing heavily] You okay? Yeah. It's just like your father, trying to undermine me through you. What's going on between you and Dad? You think I can't pick up on it? Keep your voice down! This is not about me and your father. It's about Alec. And I'll do anything to protect him. Well, you can't do this. You and your Downworlders have seen to that. You can't possibly attract the caliber of husband who could help us restore the honor to our family name. The honor comes from the deed. When you truly understand that, then you'll understand me. You're talking politics. I'm talking about Alec's life. It's all the same to a Shadowhunter, Isabelle. How can we protect others when we can't protect our own family? Alec gets that... unlike you. [inhales sharply] [huffs] [sighs deeply] Alec, wait. If you hadn't gotten here in time, I... I'm just... I'm glad you and Jace are okay now. I didn't do this for Jace. Then I'm glad you did it for you. Jace : Thank you. You have an interesting effect on people, Clary Fray. He helped save Luke's life. You all did. Thank you. For what? For running an errand? For having my back. I'm always gonna have your back. [laughs softly] Clary... Luke's asking for you. Yeah. Right. [chuckles] Thank you... so much. Tell Clary I've got something to do. Simon. [sighs] It's cool. Speed. Courage in Combat. Nourishment. Max... you know this is the Heat rune. Oh, right. Come here, you little devil. I'm gonna get you. [laughing] Max, could we have a moment? I never get to hear the good stuff. [Isabelle sighs] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so harsh. I'm used to it by now. I wish you could understand how difficult it is to be your own childrens' commander. You've made your priorities pretty clear. In times of war... We're always at war, Mom. So spare me your parenting excuses. Isabelle, I'm trying to protect all of us. I'm trying to protect you. And how exactly does what you're doing to Alec protect me? [chuckles] You remind me so much of me. If that were true, I would actually be impressed. Trust me, you wouldn't. When I was your age, I thought I had everything figured out. I thought I could change the world by breaking the rules. You broke the rules? [scoffs] Where did that person go? She was stupid. She confused passion with strength. So passion makes you weak? No. Passion makes you dangerous. That's why you're not ready for the responsibility you think you are. Thank you, Magnus. You're welcome. I'll leave you two alone. [Luke clears throat] Go easy on him. [clears throat] You know you can't avoid the question, right? I know Mom swore you to secrecy, but I've seen you stand up to her before. Why didn't you tell me about any of this? Because I was afraid you'd hate us. Not possible. Okay... the last few days, I have not had all of the information. And you still don't. But you need to know everything. It'll help you find the Mortal Cup. How? You're just gonna have to trust me. I do, more than anything. Nothing you say is ever gonna change that. Okay, but you have to trust me, too. All right. Magnus told you about the Uprising? Yeah. About the Valentine who murdered all those people? Yes. The reason he became that man was our fault... mine and Jocelyn's. I don't believe you. We betrayed him, Clary... your mother and I. We fell in love. Did you... [stammers] Wait... Are you my... No. No, we never... Slept together? Yeah. I mean, no! Your parents were married. [scoffs] Valentine was my  parabatai. We both loved him. But as his rhetoric got more violent... and he became more combative with the Clave... [sighs] we started to worry. We tried to help him, tried to temper him, but... he just kept pulling away. That just drew us closer together. We knew it was wrong, but we couldn't deny it, or hide it. young Jocelyn : He's angry all the time. [voice breaking] If only the Clave would listen to reason. We have to make Val listen to reason. Luke :  Valentine became convinced we were having an affair. He was obsessed with winning Jocelyn's heart back. For love, he was willing to do anything... even compromise his own principles. He became fixated on becoming a better soldier. That led him to do the unthinkable... experiment with Downworlder blood. [grunting] [yells] [gasps] Val! Val! Hey! Hey! Val, come on. Luke :  Once he crossed that line... we never got him back again. Luke : In the end, our love did more damage to Valentine than anything anybody else could have done. We broke his heart. At least now I know he had one... before his crazy, distorted world view set in. [young Jocelyn grunts] Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands. Clary : What was he like back then? Before he, you know... In the early days of the Circle? Oh... he was honorable. Idealistic. He was charismatic. Just Mom's type. Just like you. Oh, no. No. I never came close. He was a leader. Devoted to protecting us from dying pointless deaths. And you believed in him. If Simon told you he had the cure for cancer, you'd want to believe him, too. Well, I'd probably give him the benefit of the doubt at least. Which is what I did. What we all did. The demons were winning. We couldn't train our people fast enough to keep up. Val wanted the Clave to use the Mortal Cup to create more Shadowhunters, but that just made them angry. Isn't more Shadowhunters a good thing? Not the way he was proposing. Ever since the Angel Raziel created the first Shadowhunters with the Cup, it's been forbidden to use the Cup again to rebuild their forces. Jocelyn and I, we tried pulling him back, but he just misconstrued that as... Clary : The affair. It's not your fault, Luke. There's no way you two could have pushed him over the edge. He did that to himself... with the blood injections. And the more injections he took, the deeper it seemed he descended into madness. Val... Those things continue to multiply, while we sacrifice ourselves to protect the mundanes. The Clave is content to operate with blinders on, but I'm not! I'm the only one who sees the truth! Magnus never told me that part. He didn't know. There are some things Joce and I never talked about. Why would she hide that she's an artist... especially from me? Because after that night, she locked that part of herself away. She never wanted their lives to affect you. What did my father do? Your mother is the only other person I ever told this to. I never wanted it to burden you. Tell me. Valentine asked me to back him up on a mission. Some farmers had gone missing. He said it was werewolves. [wolves growling] Luke :  He betrayed our  parabatai  bond. [young Luke screams] And then he betrayed everything else he believed in. Why aren't you dead? Because I'm a Shadowhunter. You're an abomination. [blade ringing] [Luke growling] You should have killed yourself. young Jocelyn yelling : No! [groans] [sighs] So you've chosen. [blade ringing] [young Jocelyn grunts] [young Valentine grunts] [groans] For a while, I thought he'd killed her. He wanted us both dead. He killed thousands. Turned Shadowhunter against Shadowhunter. Do you understand what I'm saying? God only knows what he'd do if he got the Cup. We have to get the Cup before Valentine does. But I don't know where it is. [stammers] Or even where to start looking. It all starts and ends with you. How do you know that? Because I know Jocelyn. You're the only other person she would have trusted with the location of the Cup. If she trusted me so much, why didn't she tell me any of this? She didn't think this was gonna happen. She made provisions just in case it did. The potion, Dot... Jocelyn said that I should tell you everything about our past. That it would unlock you. What does that even mean? I don't know! But you do. Memory's wiped, remember? There are clues. They're inside the mundane world. Think, Clary. ♪ Like wakin' up ♪

♪ Dare to move ♪ 
♪ Dare to believe ♪ You know I have magic for that, right? I think you've exerted yourself enough for one day. Drink break? [laughs softly] ♪ Where do we go from here ♪ To us. ♪ Where do we go from here ♪ [glasses clink] ♪ How do you fly with no wings ♪ Why did you ask for me... when Jace and Clary were both here? Hmm, Jace didn't tell you? It doesn't matter. It was a lie anyway. Are warlocks always this cryptic? [chuckles] I'm not being cryptic. I'm being coy. [sighs] Let me spell it out for you. I wanted to see you again. ♪ Wearin' thin ♪ 
♪ The heart beneath ♪ Why? Why'd you come? ♪ There's no place ♪ 
♪ To call our own ♪ I'm not sure. ♪ Like a drifting haze ♪ For almost a century... I've closed myself off to feeling anything for anyone. Man or woman. You've unlocked something in me. ♪ Where do we go from here ♪ 
♪ How do you fly with no wings ♪ [cell phone ringing] Hey. Hi, Mother. ♪ From here ♪ Of course. ♪ From here ♪ Duty calls. Ah... Oh, the furrowed brow. Maryse must be recruiting you for something... unseemly. Oh, listen, Magnus, I... [stammering] I wish I could... I just... I don't know what... I understand. Stay for just one more drink? And then decide. I don't remember anything. [stammers] If Mom hid the clues, I don't know what they are. You have to figure this out! You said you had to tell me everything. [stammering] Maybe... Maybe there's something you forgot. Wait. What is this? No. Mom said this belonged to my father... No. ...but Valentine is my father. Who is "JC"? I want you to remember your father could be a good man. After what he did to you... This is worse, Clary. I don't care! Luke, I want to know, I... I need to know. You said so yourself. You have to tell me everything. "JC" stands for Jonathan Christopher... your brother. [gasps] I have a brother? You did. He died in a fire at Fairchild Manor. A fire that your father set. [gasping] [box hums] That's it. [stammers] That's the ending of the story that my mother needed me to hear, but... Is that what she meant to unlock? How did I do that? There are Shadowhunters that have unusual Angelic Powers, but I've never seen anyone do what you just did. Can these powers be inherited? I think so. [chuckles softly] I know where my mother hid the Cup.
