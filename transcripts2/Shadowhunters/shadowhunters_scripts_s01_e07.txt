 Previously on  Shadowhunters... 
 Was he bitten by an alpha? 
 Yeah. 
 [growls] 
 Clary : Oh, my God. 
 Have you spoken to Jace yet? 
 He can call me when he's done chasing the little girl. 
 Stir. 
 We can't have that girl out of Institute control. 
 The entire Shadow World is looking for her. 
 You do not get to talk about Alec, mundane. 
 I've closed myself off to feeling anything for anyone. 
 You've unlocked something in me. 
 I'm always gonna have your back. 
 I know where my mother hid the Cup. 
 I know where the Cup is. 
 Jace : Come again? 
 The tarot cards. 
 My mom, she must have painted them years ago, but the Mortal Cup has to be hidden inside the Ace of Cups. 
 The card looks exactly like it. 
 Wait, why aren't you guys happy about this? 
 All we have to do is find... 
 Dot. 
 If Dot had the cards when she was taken, we don't have much time. 
 If Valentine gets his hands on the Cup... 
 We know. 
 If Valentine started creating Shadowhunters or gained control of demons, it'd be like Beyonce riding on a dinosaur through Times Square. 
 People would notice. 
 But he can control demons. I've seen it. 
 Mmm, paying off a few demons is easy, especially since they rarely survive long enough to collect. 
 Still waiting on Valentine's thank-you card. 
 Opening the gates of hell... that's a little more tricky. 
 Valentine doesn't have the cards. 
 I do. 
 They're in my desk back at the precinct. 
 When Clary went missing, I went to the loft and I cleared everything out, 'cause I didn't want the Circle to track her. 
 That's great. This should be easy. 
 Hmm, that's what General Custer said. 
 Magnus is right. 
 Valentine has spies everywhere, even in the NYPD. 
 We have to be discreet. 
 Discreet? 
 You look like something out of  The Mummy  movie. 
 [Magnus titters] 
 Luke : We'll go in the morning. 
 Werewolf healing, remember? 
 This is nothing a couple of hours of beauty sleep can't fix. 
 Hi. 
 Okay, who are you and what did you do with Simon? 
 [chuckles] Simon? Never heard of him. 
 I'm serious. I've never seen this side of you before. 
 First, you're acting really weird, you're disappearing for days on end. 
 Now, this. 
 I mean, I've always thought you were cute, but last night you were... 
 [chuckles] I don't know. 
 [inhales] 
 You were amazing. 
 Like,  Fifty Shades  of amazing? 
 Like, Pon farr amazing. 
 [both chuckle] 
 I love it when you speak Vulcan. 
 [sighs] 
 Holy crap. 
 Simon... can I ask you something? 
 Uh... sure. 
 About us. 
 [exhales] Us? 
 [chuckling] Yeah, you know. 
 You and me... us. 
 You seriously have no idea where I'm going with this. 
 [stammers] 
 Honestly, I'm... I'm a little confused right now. 
 [chuckles] 
 But, um... in a good way. 
 Simon... when are you gonna ask me to be your girlfriend? 
 Uh... 
 [sighs] Clary... 
 Maureen : Excuse me? Clary? 
 Um... 
 Uh, yeah, just, uh... 
 I... I forgot something. I forgot, I... 
 Was it my name? Because it's Maureen. 
 No. No. It's, uh... 
 I... I forgot to turn the oven off at my mom's. 
 Simon, you don't even cook. 
 Right, which is exactly why I probably left it on. 
 So I should... I should fix that, right? 
 I'm not interested in just hooking up. 
 Maureen... 
 So if you're still stuck on Clary, then... 
 Clary's seeing someone else. 
 [stammers] Look... 
 You're more than just a hookup. [stutters] I promise. 
 I promise. 
 Okay? It's just that I've... 
 [sighs] 
 [door opens and closes] 
 [siren wailing] 
 All right, cards are on my desk. It shouldn't take long. 
 All right. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 It'll be easier to avoid unnecessary attention if I do this alone. 
 We'll wait here. 
 It sounded boring anyway. 
 Hey. 
 Stop right where you are. Don't touch anything. 
 Detective Garroway, I need your badge and your gun. 
 Who's this? 
 His name is Fisk. Internal affairs. 
 My hands are tied. You're gonna have to cooperate. 
 Have ballistics run it through the system, see what pops up. 
 You're coming with me. 
 Let's go. 
 [Luke sighs] 
 I've got a bad feeling about this. 
 What is taking him so long? 
 I know a way we could find out. 
 Just go in and see for ourselves. 
 Luke told us to stay put, so that's what we're gonna do. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 That's probably him now. 
 I doubt it. 
 [phone beeps] 
 Just so I'm clear, he did mention something about trying to avoid attention, right? 
 From the looks of it, he's doing a terrible job. 
 Circle members? 
 No, mundanes. Internal affairs officers. 
 You can tell all that just by looking at them? 
 I can tell all that by reading their badges. 
 Better than binoculars. 
 Luke had his chance. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's go. 
 Okay. 
 Alec? 
 Alec! 
 Is everything okay? 
 Better than ever. 
 Is there something you want to talk about? 
 No. All good. 
 Have you seen Alec? 
 Um, no. Why? 
 He's supposed to fill out the incident reports for all the recent demonic activity. 
 I can do it. 
 I know you can, but the Clave... 
 Will be fine getting it from me. 
 Of course they will. 
 I'll let your mother know that you're gonna handle this. 
 I'm sure she'll be very glad to hear it. 
 Thanks. 
 Look familiar? 
 Maybe. I'd have to ask my lawyer. 
 That's the way you want it? 
 One lawyer, coming up. 
 You sit tight. 
 You want a coffee or anything? 
 Garroway. 
 Coffee? 
 No. No, I'm good. 
 Suit yourself. 
 Camera. 
 Luke, what is going on? 
 I think I'm about to be the prime suspect in a murder investigation. 
 [sighs] What do we do? 
 Get the cards. 
 In my desk, bottom drawer. 
 All right. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 You can't glamour yourselves. 
 I'm not the only Downworlder on the force, and we don't know who's working for Valentine. 
 If anybody spots you... 
 We'd be leading them right to the Mortal Cup. 
 Exactly. Better to assume that everybody has the Sight than gamble that they don't. 
 [door lock clicks] 
 Luke... 
 I can handle myself. 
 Hey, what happened to the camera? 
 I've asked the same thing for years. 
 Slept at Magnus' place? 
 Didn't do much sleeping. 
 I was helping treat Luke's wounds. That's all. 
 Really? 
 What? 
 [sighs] Nothing. I believe you. 
 Okay, Magnus made cocktails. I'm telling you, nothing else happened. 
 When you're ready to talk about whatever you need to talk about, I'm here. 
 Hey, I talk to you. 
 About everything but your personal life. 
 You know, and it's kind of not fair, because I talk to you about mine all the time. 
 For example, I broke up with Meliorn. 
 Really? Turning over a new leaf? 
 [scoffs] He was a bit much. 
 Apparently, I need someone more Shadowhunter-ish. 
 Izzy, I realize that you're trying to take some of the family heat, and I appreciate it, but you can't change who you are. 
 Really? 
 And you can? 
 I know who I am. 
 I'm a guy who's about to be disowned when Dad finds out that Jace and Clary are still out doing God knows what. 
 I think Dad's used to that by now. 
 This is Jace you're talking about. 
 He said he'd be an hour. It's been three. 
 You don't think he and Clary are... 
 At a time like this? Not possible. 
 Jace :  Really? In here? 
 Clary : Why not? 
 Jace : There's got to be a better place. 
 Clary : No, here's good. 
 Jace : Ow! 
 Jace : All right. 
 [clattering] 
 [energy pulsating] 
 You need help with that? 
 Clary : I can deglamourize myself, Jace. 
 [clattering] 
 [energy pulsating] 
 It's "deglamour." 
 Clary : Whatever. 
 The cards? 
 Right. 
 How exactly are we gonna get them? 
 I doubt we can make it out of this closet without drawing attention, let alone Luke's desk and you are covered in runes. 
 Don't worry. I've got a plan. 
 A good plan this time? 
 90%. 
 Just follow my lead. 
 Oh, and I apologize. 
 Apologize for what? 
 The other 10%. 
 [sighs] You son of a bitch! 
 Oh! 
 Stop following me! 
 [whispering] Hey, what happened to being discreet? 
 Hmm? 
 Wait, what did you say? 
 You cheated on me? 
 I... Huh? 
 I did not. Whoa. 
 You will never see me at your crappy apartment again. 
 That girl means nothing to me. Nothing. 
 [Clary sighs] 
 Is that the boyfriend that I heard so much about? 
 Clary : Nope, not anymore. 
 Hi. 
 I'm dumping him. 
 Where is all of Luke's stuff? 
 IA took everything. What are you looking for? 
 I, uh... [stutters] I lost a house key and Luke normally keeps a spare in his desk, so is there any way I can get it? 
 Uh, not till he's cleared. 
 Cleared? Of... of what? 
 Oh, don't worry about it. We'll get it handled. 
 Oh. 
 Jace : Clary, I'm sorry. 
 I apologize. I just want you to know it only happened, like... two or... It just happened a couple of times and I am totally... 
 both : Shut up. 
 Babe, come on. 
 Listen, you don't get to call her "babe," okay? 
 In fact, you don't get to call her at all. 
 Clary's done with you. You got it? 
 Take him out. 
 Jace : I have rights. 
 Perhaps it's for the best? 
 [sighs] 
 Oh, matching tattoos. That's... Big red flag. 
 Oh. [chuckles] This... [stutters] It's nothing. 
 Don't worry about it. I get it. 
 You always fall for the bad boys, right? 
 Oh, is that just me? 
 Uh, right, right. [chuckles] Uh... 
 I really need that key. 
 I'm sorry, Clary, but IA has all of Luke's things in the evidence vault upstairs. 
 Oh. 
 Maybe I can help you find the one you lost. 
 Did you check your bag? 
 Oh, my God! 
 You're totally right. 
 Thank you so much. [chuckles] 
 Bye. 
 I'm going to lunch. This job is gonna be the death of me. 
 French press. 
 And a garlic bagel. 
 Extra garlic. 
 Oh, uh... um... 
 I'm doing research for a graphic novel I'm writing about vampires. 
 I don't think I'm actually becoming one, 'cause that would be crazy. 
 Where's what's-her-face? Latte-and-no-whip-cream girl? 
 Clary, uh... 
 I don't know. She's not... answering my texts. 
 Can't imagine why. [chuckles] 
 You all right? 
 Yeah, it's just, uh... [sighs] Just think I need some caffeine. 
 Okay. 
 You might want to let that brew... Never mind. 
 [exhales] Okay. 
 [sighs] 
 Not again. 
 [bubbling] 
 [sighs] 
 [sniffs] 
 Can I do something for you? 
 I need a list of everything seized from Detective Garroway's desk. 
 And I need a slice of pizza. 
 The list. Now. Full inventory. 
 Bring it up with my office. 
 I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful, but, uh, I... 
 I'm hungry. 
 [dog barking] 
 Apparently, I'm not the only one. 
 [dog growling] 
 She must smell a rat. An IA rat. 
 [scoffs] 
 [barking] 
 You know what? I'm gonna bring Alec with me next time. 
 I don't think he's ever slapped me in the face. 
 [sighs] I'm sorry, I panicked. 
 Someone call for backup? 
 Yeah. What took you guys so long? 
 Funny, I was gonna ask you the same thing. 
 It's complicated. 
 We found the Cup. 
 The Cup? 
 Yeah, but then we lost it. 
 We have to sneak back in the precinct to get it. 
 This is a disaster. 
 Hey, demon pox is a disaster. This is an inconvenience. 
 We just need a plan. That's all. 
 What about a glamour? 
 We tried that. 
 Anyone working with Valentine will see right through it. 
 Can we ask Magnus Bane to portal us inside? 
 No. 
 That'd be awkward. 
 [gasps] 
 Magnus can only portal us to places he's been to before. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Not again. Just give me a second. 
 Simon, this is really not a good time. 
 Clary, where are you? This is an emergency. 
 Simon, are you okay? 
 I'm not sure. I haven't been kidnapped yet today. 
 Simon, seriously, what's going on? 
 I think I'm sick. Like, really sick. 
 Simon, remember that time you thought you had the bird flu? 
 Okay, just stay off the Internet and you'll be fine. 
 [stutters] Yeah, I know. But this time it's different. 
 Hey... 
 This time I'm really... 
 Oh, my God. She hung up on me. 
 Simon's little problem can wait. I've got a great plan. 
 Oh, there's a first. 
 [laughs sarcastically] Just follow my lead. 
 Oh, and don't worry, in my plan, no one gets slapped. 
 Thanks, Jerry. I appreciate it. 
 We're done for today. 
 But don't go too far. You'll be hearing from me. 
 I wouldn't dream of it. 
 Listen, Garroway, do you think I'm trying to be a pain in your ass? 
 Well, the thought had occurred to me. 
 Dude, we've got your car wrapped around a street light, drenched in blood, carrying a GPS that puts you at the scene of the crime. 
 I'm not a bad guy. I'm just not stupid. 
 [knocks on door] 
 [sniffs] 
 [groans] 
 Vargas was a good cop. 
 She was my friend. 
 One of the few. 
 Your friends seem to have a habit of turning up dead. 
 I can't even imagine what your Facebook page looks like. 
 You think I killed her? 
 [inhales] No. 
 In fact, I think I'm your alibi. 
 Well, I'd appreciate that. 
 Don't thank me just yet. 
 I still haven't figured out your deal. 
 Even a blind guy can tell something weird is going on. 
 You want to do right by Vargas? 
 Help me out here. 
 You wouldn't believe me if I told you. 
 Try me. 
 Alaric : Fisk. 
 Think about it. 
 Fisk : Yeah. 
 Alaric : I checked her wrist. There's no defensive wounds. 
 Fisk : Another demonic murder? 
 Alaric : I don't think so. Similar MO, but she wasn't drained of blood. 
 The ME have a time of death? 
 Alaric : We're waiting on forensics, but early guess is she's been dead a couple of hours. 
 Fisk : A couple hours? 
 No way. I just talked to the captain 45 minutes ago. 
 You guys are killing me. 
 Check the body for venom. 
 If it's a demon, I need to know exactly what I'm looking for. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 [knock on door] 
 Simon... can we have a talk? 
 "We"? 
 You, me and your sister. 
 Do I have a choice? 
 Well, I've already ducked out of the office early, so... no. 
 Okay. 
 [sighs] 
 I stayed out last night at Maureen's. I... I should have called. [stutters] It slipped my mind. 
 So, what are you gonna do? Ground me? 
 Maureen called us this morning and she was very upset. 
 Actually, Maureen called me... and she said that you were spazzing out, like more than normal. 
 She said... She did what? 
 Well, I just tried to say that's kind of how you are with girls, but, uh, she was very upset, so... 
 I told Mom. 
 You did what? 
 Simon, Maureen thinks that... that you might be on drugs. 
 [stammering] 
 And listen, if I thought it was just marijuana I wouldn't be so worried, but, honey... you look like you're dying. 
 [scoffs] Would dying get me out of this conversation? 
 I know that I'm not usually the sentimental one here, but... we're here for you. 
 Elaine : It's all right. 
 You can tell us, whatever it is. 
 Okay, okay, um... 
 I think I have a disease. 
 Elaine : A disease? 
 Like, a bad one. 
 [gasps] Do you have an STD? 
 Okay, let's let him finish talking. 
 Look, Simon, it's really not as bad as you think. 
 These things happen, all right? 
 When I was in law school, I experimented... 
 We're really off track here. I think we really need to focus on Simon. 
 Elaine : Rebecca, it's 2016, all right? 
 Mom, I'm more than happy... 
 I had a life. 
 Hey, hey, guys... 
 [both arguing] 
 I'm still right here. 
 Rebecca : Do not make this about you. 
 I'm still right here. 
 [arguing continues] 
 Excuse me? 
 [arguing continues] 
 Shut up! 
 Simon? 
 So, I was promised a great plan. 
 We'll head up towards the vault. 
 Alec and Izzy are handling the rest. 
 All we have to do is wait for their signal... [sighs] ...and grab the Cup. 
 He's on our side. 
 You sure? 
 Isn't that the line he used when he kidnapped you? 
 Good point. 
 What now? We're supposed to climb the elevator shaft and waltz in the vault unnoticed? 
 Now, why didn't I think of that? 
 [laughs] 
 Wait, you're kidding, right? 
 Remember the binoculars? 
 Yeah. 
 This one's a Nyx rune. It's like night vision. 
 You can copy mine. 
 You got it? 
 Yeah. 
 Why do I need night vision? 
 You'll see. 
 [sighs] 
 [inhales deeply] 
 [winces] 
 Um... 
 Feel free to ask for help. 
 [flesh searing] 
 I, um... I think I can take it from here. 
 Where's the fun in that? 
 Alec : Okay, I'm guessing you're the distraction? 
 Nope. 
 I've decided to grow up, remember? 
 No more distracting for me. 
 Besides, I don't think I'm her type. 
 Oh, crap. 
 Don't worry, it's good practice. 
 Huh? 
 You know, for asking out Magnus. 
 [chuckles] 
 What are you... what are you doing? 
 Unbuttoning your shirt. What's it look like I'm doing? 
 Izzy, this is not really my department. 
 [sighs] Come on. 
 You do this sort of stuff all the time. 
 You do, I don't. 
 It's easy. 
 Come on. 
 Hey. 
 Can I help you? 
 Yeah, um... 
 [stutters] You come here often? 
 I work here. What can I help you with? 
 Right, um... 
 Right, right, right, yeah, um... 
 Yeah, I'm just... I'm looking for some information. 
 Oh, look... Oh, wow. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Let me just get that. 
 That's not... I'm so sorry. 
 That's such a mess. Let me clean that up. 
 Uh, it's not working. Okay. 
 Here, let me. 
 No, I got it. I got it. Just go. Go. 
 You sure? 
 Go. 
 Thank you so much. 
 [sizzling] 
 [groans] 
 I think you messed something up. 
 Really? 
 No, I didn't. 
 Then why isn't it working? 
 It is. 
 [alarm blaring] 
 That's the signal. 
 Whoa. 
 Right? 
 Going up. 
 [alarm continues] 
 Luke : What's going on? 
 Some sort of power surge. Whole building's fried. 
 No lights, no camera, no nothing. 
 Get anything on our killer? 
 Yeah, you were right. 
 Huge amounts of demon venom in Vargas' blood. 
 It's a shapeshifter. 
 All right. 
 I'm going after it. Alert the pack. 
 Anyone sees Vargas, kill her. 
 You were trapped in the precinct all day. 
 If that demon wanted you dead, it certainly had the opportunity. 
 It's not after me. It's after Clary. 
 Otherwise, I wouldn't be asking for your help. 
 You're pack leader now. You don't need to ask. 
 Thanks, bud. 
 What is all this crap? 
 Lunch receipts? 
 [Clary exhales] 
 [softly] You're getting pretty good with your stele. 
 Well, at least we know he's not a Downworlder. 
 Lucky for us. 
 Give me a heads up next time you're gonna do that. 
 In here. 
 This will take all day. 
 [sighs] 
 Or you could just do that. 
 That looks exactly like the Mortal Cup. 
 This is it. It has to be. 
 What's wrong? 
 [stutters] I'm not sure. I... 
 You're not sure what's wrong or you're not sure where your mom hid the Cup? 
 [sighs] 
 Did you get it? 
 Theoretically. 
 Theoretically? 
 Yeah. [sighs] 
 I found the card. I just have to figure out how I reached into my notebook before. It's... 
 It's not an exact science. 
 Can't you just pull the Cup out? 
 I can, theoretically. I just... 
 It's not as easy as it looks, Alec. 
 Listen, you two can discuss theories as much as you want when we get back to the Institute. 
 But right now, considering we just stole from the cops, I suggest we get home. 
 Guys... 
 [necklace pulsing] 
 I think the mundanes might be the least of our worries. 
 Well, at least we know the demon necklace works. 
 Never a dull day. Let's go. 
 Guys, slow down. 
 [gasps] Oh, I am so sorry. 
 [roars] 
 [growling] 
 Grandma. 
 [grunts] 
 [demon screeches] 
 What the hell? 
 Language. Not in front of Grandma. 
 How did it find us? 
 Jace : I don't know... but she brought friends. 
 How can you tell? 
 It's like seeing through a glamour. 
 You just got to pay attention to the details. 
 But I can't see anything. 
 Behind us. 
 I... I still can't see them. 
 Okay, there's too many people. 
 I don't say this often, but I agree with Clary. 
 We gotta get out of here. 
 Hey, this way! 
 [panting] What's the Unlock rune again? 
 Open sesame. 
 Jace : Go. 
 Hey, what are you doing? 
 Holding them off. Take Clary back to the Institute. 
 No, if you're staying, I'm staying. We fight together. 
 Don't be stupid. If the demons get the Cup, we're dead anyways. 
 I'm not leaving anyone behind. 
 You don't have a choice. 
 I know you guys are having a moment, okay? But we really have to go. 
 Isabelle : Don't worry. It's not like this is the first time Alec has saved your life. 
 [sighs] 
 I doubt it'd be the last. 
 Go. 
 [dialing] 
 [line ringing] 
 Clary :  Hello. 
 Clary? I need you... 
 You've reached Clary's phone. I'm not here, but you know the deal. Leave one at the beep. 
 [line beeps] 
 Um, Clary... [shuddering] I need to talk to you. 
 I think I need to talk to you more than I've ever needed to talk to you in my life. 
 I know... [inhales deeply] 
 I know you're busy saving your mom, but... 
 I think I'm becoming a vampire. 
 [phone beeps] 
 Darling, you don't know the half of it. 
 Blood is stronger than will. 
 [shuddering] Shut up. 
 Stronger than desire. 
 Shut up! [grunts] 
 Camille echoing :  Even stronger than love. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [gasps] 
 [shuddering] 
 Come to me. 
 What you really want is... 
 [yells] 
 [gasping] 
 [sobbing] 
 [panting] Hold on. 
 I'm sorry, Jace. 
 It's okay. We can take a breather. 
 Clary : No, it's not that. I, um... 
 I'll scout ahead. 
 I'm sorry for all the trouble I've put you through. 
 You don't have to apologize to me, Clary. 
 Unfortunately, you can't stop me. 
 [chuckles] Well, yeah, I'm starting to see that. 
 Just... I've been so focused on trying to find my mom, I don't think I realized how much you've actually done for me. 
 So, thank you. 
 Clary, I'm a Shadowhunter. 
 It's kinda my job. 
 You... Your job? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, you'd do this for anybody? 
 Maybe not Simon. 
 Funny, I think he'd say the same thing about you. 
 You know, you're not too bad yourself. 
 Me? 
 Yeah. 
 You kicked some pretty serious ass back at the police station. 
 At least, you got my ass kicked. 
 Thanks... I think. 
 [necklace pulsing] 
 Guys? It's pulsing. 
 Again? 
 Getting close. Let's spread out. 
 [faint chittering] 
 Izzy, where is it? 
 I don't know. 
 It's like they're right here, but I don't see them. 
 [snarling] 
 [clattering] 
 [screeching] 
 [Clary screams] 
 [grunts] 
 [snarling] 
 [gasps] 
 [Jace grunts] 
 [gasps] 
 Are you hurt? 
 I'll live. 
 What are those things? 
 Shax demons. 
 They're like the bloodhounds of the Shadow World. 
 They've been tracking us. 
 So what do we do? 
 The Institute's only a couple of blocks from here. 
 We can't lose them, but they won't be able to track us if we split up. 
 But, I don't... I don't... 
 Clary, you'll be fine. 
 Izzy and I will draw them away. 
 No matter what happens, just keep running. 
 [snarling] 
 They're coming. 
 Jace, I... 
 Run, Clary! 
 [panting] 
 [creature chitters] 
 Crap! 
 [screeching] 
 [whimpering] 
 [screeching] 
 Get back! 
 I said, get back! 
 [knocking on door] 
 Elaine : Simon? 
 [sighs] You still alive in there? 
 Hey, I ordered in Rizzo's. 
 Are you okay? 
 I've never heard him this quiet around pasta before. 
 Go. 
 Yeah? Okay. 
 All right, Simon, I'm coming in. 
 [gasps] Simon? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Jace! 
 Jace? 
 Clary. 
 Hey. 
 Oh, you're hurt! 
 I'll be all right. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm... 
 I'm fine. Barely, but... 
 What happened? 
 One of the Shax demons cornered me. 
 But I got the Cup. 
 I don't know, my instincts just kicked in and I... I could do it. 
 Maybe you're right. Maybe I'll be a Shadowhunter after all. 
 Clary, you're amazing. I always knew you could do it. 
 Now give me the Cup and let's go. 
 [scoffs] Give you the Cup? 
 Yes. 
 Only until we get back to the Institute. 
 It's the only way I can keep you safe. 
 I'll die before I let anything happen to you. 
 Yeah, you're totally right. 
 [grunts] 
 Clary? [breathing heavily] 
 Jace... No! Oh, my God! Jace! 
 [gasps] 
 [shuddering] 
 [snarling] 
 [roars] 
 Luke : Clary! 
 Get back! 
 How do I know you're Luke? 
 Luke : I got you spray paint for your birthday. 
 What happened? 
 Uh, demons. 
 Long story. Um... [breathing heavily] 
 Where'd you come from? 
 Jail. 
 I ran into Alec. 
 Said you might be down here. Thought you might need some help. 
 Apparently not. Looks like she took care of it. 
 Shouldn't we get going or something? 
 More demons could be coming, right? 
 Oh, don't worry about it. 
 I got the pack on the lookout. 
 If there's any other demons, we'll take care of them. 
 [chuckles] Look at you, leader of the pack. 
 Well, you know, it has its perks. 
 Shall we? 
 Yeah. Right. 
 These tunnels are swarming with Shax demons. 
 If she's down there, it's only a matter of time before they find her. 
 We need to make sure that doesn't happen. 
 All right, listen up. I want this entire institute on high alert. 
 I don't care what anybody else says, I'll take full responsibility. 
 Right now, Clary is the only thing that matters. 
 Jace! 
 Clary. 
 I did it. I got the Cup. 
 I don't care about the Cup. 
 When I came out of the tunnels, I didn't see you. I was worried something might have happened... 
 There was a demon. 
 Shapeshifter. It looked just like you. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. 
 And the demon? 
 I sent him straight back to hell. 
 How'd you know it wasn't me? 
 I just knew. 
 Really? 
 Kind of a risk, wasn't it? 
 Well, this may come as a surprise, but I actually do listen to some of the things you tell me. 
 You just have to pay attention to the details. 
 Yeah, well, I told you the first time we met, you have the Sight. 
 You're a Shadowhunter, just like the rest of us.

 Simon : Hello? 
 Anybody home? 
 You don't have a doorbell, so I... I let myself in. 
 Raphael? 
 [whispering] Okay, okay. Oh, my God. 
 All right, I know someone's here somewhere! 
 Please! 
 I think I'm sick. 
 I need someone to tell me what's going on, because it's ruining my life! 
 Am I becoming a vampire? 
 [Camille laughing] 
 Poor darling boy. 
 I was wondering when you'd come back. 
 You... 
 You're not mad? 
 On the contrary, I've been expecting you. 
 You see... it's just my blood running through your veins. 
 It can have some curious effects. 
 But I assure you, they're all harmless. 
 In time, they'll fade and you'll return to normal. 
 [shudders] 
 Thank God. Um... 
 [stuttering] But I'm okay? I'm still human? 
 Well, of course you are. 
 Or at least you would've been. 
 [screaming]
