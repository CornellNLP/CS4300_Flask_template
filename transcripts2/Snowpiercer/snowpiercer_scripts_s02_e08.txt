 - Things fall apart, right? 
 Or do they? 
 Who can tell anymore what's true,  what's a Wilford ruse? 
 - Hey. 
 - So we hang on too tight to what we do know,  crack ourselves into harder factions. 
 We're not afraid of our Ag-Sec failing  or Bio-Security anymore. 
 We're lighting red lanterns for Wilford because we're afraid of each other. 
 ♪  And me? 
 I'm out here selling the only common ground left. 
 That we're all human beings. 
 You know, who need love and connection and space for hope. 
 Or we'd kill each other. 
 What is it about recent history  that's so freaking hard to remember? 
 ♪  [alarm blaring] 
 ♪  Well, Eternal Engineer. 
 He's always been a social engineer, hasn't he? 
 He'd have to be. 
 He rendered us all into his system. 
 And even though his Engine may be eternal,  the rest of Snowpiercer, she still runs on meat. 
 All 1,034 cars long.

 ♪  - He confessed, Boki, like I'm sitting here with you. 
 And then he cinched his little homemade murder bag  around his throat, and tried to freeze his own head off. 
 - You love this story, don't you? 
 More cover, from a Tailie for the Tailies. 
 - I hate this story, Breachman. 
 But I gotta keep telling it. 
 I gotta get on the loudspeaker  and defend the Tail to the whole train because it's true. 
 They didn't do it. 
 You want revenge. 
 I get it. 
 But you gotta open your eyes. 
 - 30 years I risked my life for Wilford. 
 30 years. 
 No, he would not have his Breachmen killed. 
 - Boki, take some time. 
 Help us hold the middle. 
 Well, I'm glad we had this meeting,  but we can cross him off the list.

 [door creaks] 
 - Engineer.

 It's been eons.

 ♪ Well, I guess you scared me too ♪   
 - She can sing,  but can she clean her room? 
 - Show some respect. 
 The woman's just got back on her horse. 
 You'll see. 
 Lovely stretch of track, the Mongols. 
 Undulating. 
 Efficient terrain. 
 - You're bathing too much. 
 - I beg your pardon? 
 - Well, you think when you bathe,  so you must be up to something. 
 - Well, Engineer Cavill, if I was up to something,  you don't necessarily need to know about it, do you? 
 - I noticed that there was  an intentional breach this morning. 
 - That was Snowpiercer, jettisoning the dead. 
 - Nope, not that breach. 
 On this train, actually, in our cold lock. 
 - Well, they're probably just testing the seal. 
 [dramatic music] 
 - It hasn't been like this before. 
 Walking around, I can feel it. 
 I got no-go zones. 
 There were a lot of red lanterns last night. 
 - The Tail can't move freely at all. 
 Most of us are right back there again. 
 - Half the train is brainwashed. 
 We've lost the Tunnelmen. 
 They're openly calling for Wilford's return. 
 Doesn't matter that I got two suspects behind bars. 
 People just believe what they wanna believe. 
 - What about Second Class? 
 - Most of us still back you. 
 The Bourgeoisie will hold the middle long as they can. 
 That's probably why we always get screwed. 
 - Did you all just get on at the last whistle stop? 
 You've got the Brakemen, you can relax. 
 - You sure about that? 
 I saw some of your boys  throwing up the Wilford horns at the funeral. 
 - Yeah, that's for the Breachmen, it's tradition. 
 They're holding their posts. 
 They'll follow me. 
 - Well, like, I still don't get it. 
 Like, why don't you just let me stay here? 
 - It's only for a little time. 
 - It's much safer here. 
 I'm telling you. 
 - Hey, Fireball, what's the fuss? 
 - Dad, why do I have to stay uptrain? 
 - Hi. 
 - Carly, it's just until things settle down, okay? 
 You'll be back in no time. 
 This way, you'll be closer to school,  and you don't have to keep going back and forth  through all this. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 It's all right, okay? 
 Come here. 
 - I'm gonna miss you. 
 - Miss you. 
 All right. 
 Now, look at it this way. 
 You can misbehave at the Paolis'. 
 Just don't make my Brakeman use his nightstick on you  on the way up. 
 - [laughs] 
 - I love you. 
 [sighs] 
 - See you soon. 
 - Okay. 
 - I love you. 
 [water running] 
 - [sighs] 
 So? 
 - We're divided as hell. 
 Layton's trying to keep the peace, but we're--  you know, we're one dirty look away from a civil war. 
 - People have a hard time believing  Pastor Logan had the Breachmen killed. 
 - Do you? 
 - I know you lost your faith on this train,  but for those of us holding on to it,  this one's hard to reconcile. 
 - You keep the faith, remember? 
 I keep the peace.

 Wardell. 
 - We're mopping up as fast as we can,  but there are three cars affected. 
 - Three? 
 - Yup, LJ's on top of this,  but there's water in the subtrain now,  so I think you better come with me. 
 - I think I better. 
 All right, go on. 
 Good luck, LJ.

 Salt on fresh skin. 
 Hmm?

 I have a little trick I'd like to play on your mind. 
 These are your hands. 
 There you go. 
 [grunts] 
 No, please, trust me. 
 Focus on your hands. 
 Watch me touching them. 
 Good. 
 You see, your brain believes there's still a hand. 
 A cluster of confused neurons couldn't make sense of it,  so it became fixated on your pain.

 Not such a far-fetched idea, is it? 
 Practice. 
 Retool your brain. 
 It'll be fun. 
 We won't be locking your door anymore. 
 Welcome to Big Alice. 
 - Pressure surges are popping up all over the train. 
 Our port intake won't close, so we're taking on too much snow. 
 Excuse me. 
 Convert water to hydrogen,  its offshoot supplies water for the train,  so when the gills are jammed open... 
 - Too much hydrogen, and a tsunami of water. 
 - Exactly. 
 It has to be external. 
 Something's jammed the gills open. 
 Well, we can manually vent the excess,  but that's gonna slow us down, so that's serious. 
 - How serious, scale of one to ten? 
 - Normally, I'd call it a three. 
 We'd send out a team of Breach workers to free it by hand. 
 - But since all of our Breachmen are dead except Boki,  who might refuse to do it... 
 - Six out of ten. 
 - We can round that up to a ten,  assuming Wilford's involved. 
 - Not everything's Wilford. 
 - Our intakes do get jammed, it happens. 
 - Boscovic's still grieving. 
 Gotta ask him to risk his life. 
 - Well, make it fast. 
 We're gonna start losing time.

 A little more effort, you could be beautiful again.

 - What's happened on Snowpiercer? 
 Is Layton still standing? 
 - More like crawling, but yes. 
 - You've defected. 
 - I've returned. 
 We had very different journeys,  but we were both leaders on Snowpiercer. 
 We spent years being responsible for others. 
 And now that we're here,  without all that weight,  I don't know about you, but I've never slept so well.

 They've slowed down. 
 Why? 
 - For pity's sake. 
 Why don't you just ask them? 
 - Boki is getting suited up. 
 Once we free the intake,  we'll gradually bring her back up to speed,  but it's gonna cost us.

 Good afternoon, Big Alice. 
 You're probably wondering why we've slowed. 
 - Yes, we're going to be late picking up Melanie. 
 What's going on?

 - Routine maintenance, actually. 
 We're just taking advantage of the straight track. 
 - Well, hello, Ben. 
 Can we be of any assistance?
