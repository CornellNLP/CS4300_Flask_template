 I know Wilford's back, but you need to get it together. 
 Previously on "Snowpiercer..."   I am still a Tailie Josie. 
 And you need my support, or you'll lose them. 
 Our people have a new cause now. 
 This high point here   is as close as we can get to the station. 
 To make over the top, we're gonna need   to pull power from First and Second Class. 
 Push her over the hill. 
 She'll be gone again. 
 Power down the cars now! 
 The hope is real, Melanie's getting off the train to prove it. 
 Please promise me you'll look after Alex. 
 We'll all be waiting for you right here when you get back. 
 One month.

 Good, and? 
 Well, Wilford opens a lot of old wounds, so just go easy on her. 
 Hello there. 
 Good morning.

 Well, congratulations, Mr. Layton.

 Hmm.

 Oh, yes, the great uplink with Melanie. 
 What if there's just silence but no contact at all? 
 Then she froze to death exactly as you said. 
 Quite the cliffhanger, isn't it?

 - What do you want? 
 [CHUCKLES]  
 What does Mr. Layton think I want? 
 I know... your paramour, Miss Audrey. 
 Oh, "paramour." What novel are you reading? 
 Why don't you just invite her over already? 
 Because what I want    is much more fun. 
 How about a night out, my dear, on Snowpiercer?

  Agreed. 
  This is our leap of faith. 
  We want to make inroads with his crew, show them what freedom looks like so that Wilford can't demonize us.
