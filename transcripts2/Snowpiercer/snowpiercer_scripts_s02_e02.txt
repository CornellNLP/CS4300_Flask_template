 Hello. 
 How lovely to see you. (CROWD BOOING) 
 I love what you’ve done with the place. 
 It’s absolutely amazing. Justice! 
 (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) 
 Hello. Oh, cheer up. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Hello, darling. 
 Good to see you. Good to see you. 
 It’s lovely to see you, lovely to see you. 
 Mr. Wilford, Mr. Wilford! Oh, let her through. 
 Come, child. 
 Why do you look familiar? 
 I’m LJ Folger. So you are. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 How are Robert and Lilah? 
 They died in the war. 
 Oh, you have my deepest condolences. 
 Oh. 
 Come on, come on. 
 You still have friends up here, sir. 
 Hey, keep your mouth shut. 
 Okay, Mr. Wilford, let’s keep it moving. 
 The subtrain is waiting. Aye, aye. 
 (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 
 Hello there. 
 Hello there, hi. Hello. 
 Ladies and gentlemen… (SIGHS) 
 Mr. Wilford. 
 (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 
 Table for eight, please. (LAUGHTER) 
 Hello. 
 I will confess, this relationship confuses me. 
 I thought you overthrew her. 
 (CHUCKLES) We’ve had our moments. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Snowpiercer, 
 I would like to welcome Mr. Wilford and his crew aboard. 
 (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 
 Yes, we do, Mr. Wilford! Thank you. Thank you. 
 Thank you, Mr. Layton. 
 I look forward to the aquarium First Class dining in my Nightcar. (CHUCKLES FALSELY) 
 I’m afraid we have graver concerns to address today, Mr. Wilford. Of course. 
 Concerns that must be addressed together as one train. 
 Head Engineer Cavill. 
 Thank you. (CLEARS THROAT) 
 (SIGHS) 
 People of Snowpiercer and Big Alice… the Earth is warming. (CROWD MURMURS) 
 CW7 in the upper atmosphere is dissipating. 
 Instead of 1,000-year timeframe, the planet may create warm spots that could support recolonization in our lifetimes. 
 (CROWD MURMURING EXCITEDLY) 
 Now… we have a lot to learn, a lot to prepare for, and we have to do it together. 
 First, we need to boot up the Breslauer Research Station in the Rocky Mountains. 
 We just traveled that line. It’s not fit for Snowpiercer. 
 She’d never make it through. 
 Second, we need to release a network of sounding balloons across the continent into Asia as far as the Himalayan terminus. 
 The balloons will relay data to the research station, and Snowpiercer will return in a month’s time to collect it, at which point, we hope to have found what we’re looking for… An X on the map where life can begin again. 
 (CROWD MURMURING) 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 How are we to believe any of this? 
 This is the woman who pretended to be me for seven years. 
 There’s no lie too audacious for her. 
 She’s not lying. 
 Oh, and here is the blood-soaked stowaway to back her up. How comforting for you all. 
 A thief and a rebel. (LAUGHS) 
 Uh, Mr. Wilford, sir. Yes? 
 The CW7 will… Not to contradict you, sir. 
 Yeah, just say it. 
 The CW7, it may have been buried in a larger compound. Ammonium sulfate. 
 And if that’s what it was in the quantities we saw… 
 The theory holds, sir. 
 So what do you say, Mr. Wilford? 
 Should we recolonize Earth or nah? 
 All right, to get the research station online, it’ll need to be manned. That’s right. 
 Someone out there for a month. 
 Someone who knows the station, someone who knows the science, someone with breach experience. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Yes. 
 You really should have led with that, Melanie. 
 For this to work, has to be you. 
 What? (CHUCKLES) 
 I’m sure our head engineer isn’t the only scientist who can man this station. Oh, but she is, Mr. Layton. 
 She is, aren’t you, Melanie? 
 Your brilliance is exactly why we’re here.
