 This cold isn’t something we can tame. We did this to our climate. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Now only the Earth herself can restart her warm heart. I believe we can find her pulse again. And my biggest fear… isn’t dying out here. It’s that the cold-hearted among us will crush that hope before I can prove it.

 I found the bodies of two of the scientists stationed here at the Freeze… one male, shot in the head… the other a woman who slit her wrists. 
 Must’ve been a grim place to face the end of the world. 
 But at first light, I have to power it back up, patch my batteries into the solar array. 
 Then I’ll go back down for the sled I left behind with my rations.

 In the old time, the future seemed multifaceted. 
 We had careers, families, personal aspirations, places to go, friends to see, bucket lists– 
 the hum of human dreams we took for granted. 
 But we were sleepwalking, just one step away from trading all those possible futures for the shared fate of the Freeze. 
 I thought I’d find you here. 
 It’s a beautiful thing we’ve created. 
 Ah. Depends how we define “created.” 
 Well, I suppose you might deserve a little credit. 
 You’re the glue. 
 You put all Snowpiercer’s pieces together. 
 She’s just as much yours as she is mine. 
 And you will never hear me repeat that in public. 
 [cork pops] 
 Whatever your investors need to hear, Joseph. 
 Oh, they heard it. 
 My “Engine Eternal.” 
 Depends how we define “eternal.” 
 [chuckles] Now, now… let’s not ruin the moment. 
 That’s not possible, because now… we finally get to drive her.

 So, with your supplies under that avalanche, all you have left is one ration pack… one bag of sweeties from Ben… and an arm. 
 I’ll manage without the arm. 
 Really? That seems a bit optimistic. 
 According to the logbooks, our fine young cannibals out there were climate scientists. 
 They came out at the start of the Freeze looking for a way to survive CW-7– well, the effects of it. 
 Apparently they didn’t succeed, though she did hang on for five months. 
 I only have to make it one. 
 Hmm.

 Afraid to look upon your predecessors’ visage? 
 Just don’t want to see it. 
 Because they had a little girl. 
 You’ve acquired a… sentimental streak, Melanie. 
 You’re a lot more useful when you’re naive and ambitious. 
 Snowpiercer should be releasing the first of her weather balloons right about now. 
 I am… patched into the climate-modeling program. 
 Just need to link to the balloon from the radio tower. 
 Feed it enough data points to extrapolate a model. 
 [echoing] Well, if anyone can kludge together a heuristic climate model, it’s you, my dear. 
 Shame you have to rely on Ben, though, hmm? 
 And his balloons. 
 And that Spaniard. 
 [laughing] Come on. 
 You know Javi’s Colombian. 
 Oh, well, perhaps that’s where you’ll find our fabled Eden. 
 And he didn’t know we were stealing the train from you. 
 Hmm. 
 Actually, we were two days down the track before he figured it out. 
 This is nice, isn’t it? 
 Jousting?

 Lost your biscuit? 
 I must’ve eaten it. 
 [echoing] I know you don’t believe that. 
 No. 
 I didn’t eat that cracker. 
 Which begs the question… who did? 
 Perhaps our cannibals are hungry. 
 Either that, or you’re cracking up, Engineer. 
 Tell me you aren’t really doing this. 
 With everything else we need, you’re working on your brothel? 
 Not a brothel. A Nightcar! 
 This train is now an ark for humanity, not your personal indulgences. 
 Can’t it be both? 
 [chuckles] 
 Art onstage… and entertainment in the back. 
 It sustains the soul, Melanie… and it’s a release valve to keep everyone under control. 
 The resources that you’re wasting on this could sustain 20 more people that we’re going to need. 
 Ticketing says you removed half of my geneticists from the passenger list. 
 We have more important priorities. 
 Like what? 
 Like…your security? 
 I promised you-all guns will be confiscated and thrown from the train. 
 But the Jackboots will keep order. 
 3,000 souls stuffed into a 10-mile steel tube– 
 you think they’re all gonna suddenly start singing “Kumbaya”? 
 I think that if we are going to save humankind, we need people who actually know how to save humankind. 
 How many? Six geneticists… and next of kin–12 total. 
 Just cut 12 Jackboots. 
 I’ll cut six. [scoffs] 
 Joseph, please… 
 There are gonna be more important things than order. 
 Nothing’s more important than order. 
 Do you even believe in any of this? 
 Clearly, I’ve been working you too hard… which is why I will forgive what you just said. 
 Snowpiercer has only one Head Engineer–her creator. 
 She runs on my order. 
 And if you can’t accept that, then… your family can stay behind. 
 Is that clear? 
 [chuckles] You can’t– you can’t sugarcoat the end of the world, Melanie. 
 Not everything’s going to be fine, but I promise you… you will survive. 
 ♪ 
 Thank you, Joseph. 
 [computers humming] 
 It’s been ten days since I arrived. 
 If I had food… [chuckles] 
 This would be a glowing report. 
 With each new probe, the system has more data, and I coax a climate model. 
 The picture’s far from complete. 
 Now the question… is whether I can survive long enough to finish painting it.

 Hunger’s a bitch, ain’t it? 
 You’re getting a little taste 
 of what you did to us back in the Tail. 
 Not to rub it in. 
 No, you’re rubbing it in. 
 Yeah, I am. 
 Those bodies might have a little freezer burn, but I wouldn’t let that put you off. 
 No judgment here.

 I’m losing it?

 Oh! Very nice. 
 Looks like something a Tailie would’ve cooked up. 
 That’s what I’m talking about.

 I’ve been thinking about the three bodies I found. 
 Torrid affair. 
 Arthur was the first to go. 
 The fellow with the bullet in his brainpan. 
 The other two got rid of him. 
 He was her husband. Really? 
 The woman who killed herself. How’d you find that out? 
 He’s the guy on the screensaver. 
 Oh, I like that twist. 
 Maybe he got sick. Yes. 
 She and the other fellow knew he was a goner. 
 Every day he lingered on was another day he was consuming food they needed. 
 [softly] So they put him out of his misery. 
 Shot to the head. 
 She sacrificed him, Melanie… 
 Like you did to me.  
 [sighs] 
 She made the right decision. 
 I knew you’d say that. 
 What else could she do? 
 [crowd shouting indistinctly] 
 [suspenseful music] 
 There’s thousands of ’em. 
 We need reinforcements at the main gate. 
 Where’s Javi? 
 Engine room. 
 How did they find out departure time? 
 It’s 45 below and getting colder by the minute, you know. 
 [phone rings] Where else are they gonna go? 
 It’s Engineer Cavill again. 
 Has the transport with my family arrived yet? 
 I need to know the moment they’re on the train. 
 What the hell’s going on downtrain? 
 Wait. I told you. 
 Can you get me Tail Command? Both of you! 
 More security! Hold on. 
 We’re about to be overrun before we leave the station. 
 Commander Grey’s on the line. 
 Right. 
 Is that you, old Blood and Thunder? 
 What’s the story back there? 
 The perimeter fence is holding, sir, but more just keep coming. 
 We fired live rounds, but it won’t hold much longer. 
 If they break through… you unleash hell on them. 
 You do whatever it takes to hold them back. 
 Is that clear?  
 Yes, sir. 
 All necessary force. 
 Last train to Clarksville, people. 
 My family isn’t on board yet. 
 And we still need 30 minutes to finish cycling up the engine, sir.

 Yum. [chuckles] 
 Seven years hiding and procreating in a steam vent, and now straight into our stomachs. 
 Yeah, well… zero regrets. 
 I like your chances better now. 
 The vent can supplement your heat and allow more power for your databases. 
 Doing everything I can. 
 Still a lot of track between us. 
 What will you do without your sled to meet us? 
 I’ll walk back to the track… pack a battery and the hard drive on the sled.
