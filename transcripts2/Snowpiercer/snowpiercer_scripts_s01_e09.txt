 ♪♪  ♪♪  What's the holdup, Commander? 
 Why aren't we advancing? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Our plan is on track. 
 We go section by section. 
 Mr. 
 de la Torre will access the engine and override the doors,  seal an area, and we'll flood it with gas. 
 Then my men enter and mop up. 
 If the gas gets in the ventilation system,  it could spread train-wide. 
 How do you avoid gassing civilians? 
 We won't. 
 -Oh, dear God. 
 -Jesus Christ. 
 If they're sheltering rebels, they leave us no choice. 
 We need a workforce. 
 Our lives depend on it. 
 We'll train more. 
 We're overpopulated as it is. 
 Ruth: We should discuss Melanie Cavill's execution. 
 It should be a public dethroning. 
 You don't dethrone pirates. 
 You make them walk the plank. 
 The point is that there are guidelines  for an orderly hand-over of power. 
 Listen to you people. 
 The Tailie horde is at the gate. 
 Stamp them out. 
 Crush every last spark of this mutiny now forever,  or there will be no train to hand over. 
 ♪♪  Bennett: Look at that. 
 Look at that. 
 You let her right in. 
 Unbelievable. 
 You little sh1t! 
 Do you have any idea what you've done? 
 I freed the Tail. 
 You're not a soldier, Miles. 
 You're a tragic child. 
 And this? 
 This is trouble you can't even fathom. 
 You know what? 
 [ Clattering ] 
 You, my friend, you're gonna sit here. 
 You're gonna be quiet, and you're not gonna move. 
 And if you touch anything, I will cut you into little pieces  and put you in the composting toilet. 
 Do you understand? 
 Do you understand?! 
 Oh, come on. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 Is that a radio? 
 Shut up! 
 Come on. 
 Be good to me. 
 It's a comms backup. 
 Short-range signal. 
 Goes tip to tail. 
 Why not use the hard lines? 
 'Cause they'll be listening in, kid. 
 If Melanie's out there, she'll know to use this. 
 Mama Grande: Santiago. 
 Santiago. 
 My grandson, Santiago. 
 Have you seen him? 
 No? 
 [ Speaking Spanish ] 
 -Layton. 
 Nice to see. 
 -Mama Grande! 
 My grandson, Santiago, did not come back. 
 Did you see him in the battle? 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 He was in the Nightcar on the front. 
 He's alive still, amigo. 
 I feel it.

 Good to see you, brother. 
 You look good. 
 You're back. 
 Yeah. 
 Where's Strong Boy and Z-Wreck? 
 Uh...can we talk somewhere? 
 Things went to sh1t pretty fast, didn't they? 
 You know, there's a whole new group of lunatics running First. 
 You got the Folgers and then that -- that GI Joe guy. 
 And Melanie -- Melanie's in line to be executed today. 
 Good. 
 Have you seen the food up there? 
 Layton, they got this cake. 
 And they use olive oil. 
 And the -- the -- the mouth feel is --  Why are you here, Pike? 
 Because I am proud of you, brother. 
 I mean, you damn near pulled this whole thing off. 
 Then grab a spear. 
 No, they're -- they're going scorched-earth. 
 Car by car. 
 Rebels, civilians, they'll gas the lot of you. 
 They can't. 
 No, they can't. 
 They can't do it. 
 They -- They need people to run the train. 
 You want to test that theory? 
 'Cause they're sure keen to. 
 Lay down your weapons. 
 They'll show mercy. 
 You really believe that? 
 The Tailies will go back to the Tail. 
 The Thirdies will go back to work. 
 What do you get? 
 Clean sheets. 
 F-Fresh food. 
 And the pleasure of mopping up your mess,  because after you announce your surrender, you'll be executed. 
 ♪♪  You got one hour to decide, Layton. 
 Pike: Your life for all of theirs. 
 If you're half the man you claim to be, you'll take that deal. 
 ♪♪  It's not gonna end with you. 
 Or with us. 
 Layton: Gas or surrender. 
 We risk losing everything we fought for. 
 So there's no surrender. 
 Okay. 
 You need to speak to Zarah. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 This may be your last chance. 
 Go see her. 
 Please. 
 So there's no way to open this engine door. 
 Bennett will hold out as long as he can. 
 He's loyal to Melanie. 
 You need to get control of those systems, Mr. de la Torre. 
 Look, maybe Layton will surrender. 
 Maybe we won't have to use the gas at all. 
 And maybe I'll slaughter every last one of them. 
 You can handle this position? 
 I'll tap in downtrain, override the master controls.

 Claims that she saved us from the man,  while all this time she's been up here stewing in his juices. 
 Obsessed with him is what she is -- obsessed. 
 Is she dead yet, Nolan? 
 'Cause I'll ice her me bloody self. 
 What, you think I've lost the plot, don't you?

 Quite the opposite. 
 You know the soul of this Train. 
 I have the army.

 That is working. 
 At any given time, there's only so much to go around.

 Why would you do that? 
 Because Snowpiercer won't survive  with him and the Folgers in charge. 
 But I can't do it on my own, and we have to act fast. 
 All the Jackboots are gathered together. 
 If we disconnect a section of the train,  we can wipe them out in one go. 
 How does that work? 
 Bennett will orchestrate from the engine,  but we need to release manual safeties  from the separation points. 
 There's a fork in the track ahead. 
 Bennett will adjust speed  so that we hit it at the precise time,  releasing the cars  and sending the Jackboot army into the freeze. 
 Till: If what you're saying is even possible,  we'd be clearing your way back to power. 
 I won't be in charge. 
 You will. 
 So, you're just gonna give up control.
