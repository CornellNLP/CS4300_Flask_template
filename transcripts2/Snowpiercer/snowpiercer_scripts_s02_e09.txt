 [soft dramatic music] 
 Hope is a powerful thing. 
 Melanie used it to unite the people, first with a lie, but then with the promise of a life off of Snowpiercer. 
 ♪ 
 Andre Layton used hope to inspire his people, to fight for their freedom, but look where that’s got him. 
 And Mr. Wilford is a different story. 
 He’s turned hope into fear. 
 He’s turned the train against itself and then offered security. 
 ♪ 
 The funny thing is, since he took control, everything appears to be running smoothly. 
 ♪ 
 Everyone is showing up for work. 
 The supply lines are a picture of order. 
 ♪ 
 But we’ve been here before. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Hey, hand those over. 
 Come on, let’s move. Let’s go. 
 My own hope I keep hidden. 
 Time to go. 
 Hidden in the few people who can rekindle it. 
 I’ve got nothing more on Roche or his family. 
 Hey, load up and move! Let’s go. 
 Wilford sent for me. 
 You better come inside. 
 You all right? 
 Any message from our friends downtrain? 
 They have the same info, that Andre’s in Big Alice Compost. 
 They call it the Swamp. 
 Oh. 
 Any idea what Wilford wants from me? 
 I’ll try and find out. 
 Okay. 
 He’s got me up to my eyeballs planning a special evening. 
 Good friend Audrey probably told them all about us. 
 I can’t believe she fell for his sh1t. 
 At least she’s got the sense not to show her face. 
 Look, the way to survive Mr. Wilford, you just gotta be something that he needs. 
 You keep your chin up. 
 Yes, ma’am. 
 Mr. Wilford’s order comes at a very high price. 
 We’re done here, okay. 
 And I just know that something awful is coming. 
 On Snowpiercer, 1,034 cars long. 
 [dramatic music] 
 ♪ 
 How are the evening’s festivities coming on? 
 Right on schedule, sir. 
 Might I ask-is there a guest list? 
 Mm, ah, yes. 
 Random winners, that’s Kevin’s domain. 
 He’s in charge of a special surprise today. 
 Oh, what kind of surprise? 
 One for the whole train to celebrate rightful leadership. 
 Take some time off, Ruth, so you can enjoy some of it too, but first I have a job for the both of you. 
 Both of us, sir, together? 
 Snowpiercer’s getting muddy, all the classes mixed up and down. 
 What a mess. 
 Well, you ought to begin a full census. 
 I want the passengers organized like in the old days. 
 I want to know who is where doing what. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Yes, sir. 
 He’ll change everything around now. 
 Wilford wants resiliency. I hate that word. 
 He wants to keep us apart. 
 Remember, they’re gonna be monitoring everything we say between the Engines. 
 You’re gonna be okay. 
 Yeah, until when? 
 What if he throws me in the Swamp? 
 He’s picking us off one by one. 
 He can’t afford to lose another Engineer. 
 Check in with HQ? 
 Yeah. 
 I need you to keep pushing this train forward. 
 We’re a week away from picking Melanie up. 
 Yeah, if she’s there. 
 She’ll be there. 
 We’re already a day late. 
 We lost contact with her over a week ago. 
 But Wilford doesn’t know that, does he? 
 Well, keep it that way. 
 [sighs] 
 Get her home safe. That’s the mission. 
 No questions. 
 All right. 
 Come on, let’s go. 
 ♪ 
 Y tú…vienes conmigo. [chuckles] 
 ♪ 
 What’s the big surprise, Kevin? 
 The sooner we get the census going, the sooner you’ll find out. 
 Oh, come on, I know you’re dying to tell me. 
 Sorry, sworn to secrecy. 
 You know how he is. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [door chimes] 
 What is all of this? 
 Patients’ Records. 
 Took ’em right out of my clinic. 
 These are not passenger files. 
 These are medical records. 
 Supposed to be confidential. 
 He wants them divided by age–children, adolescents, 18 to 39. The rest, elderly. 
 Elderly? 
 Dear me. 
 What’s all this in aid of, Kevin? 
 I guess he wants to see who’s fit for what. 
 A sample questionnaire for each of the passengers to fill out. 
 “Are you an un-ticketed passenger? 
 Are you aware of any passengers who fought with the rebels?” 
 Well, it’s for the archives-a matter of historical record. 
 I’ll tell him you’re displeased, though. 
 No, Kevin, you won’t. 
 I’ll have my own conversations with Mr. Wilford, thank you very much. 
 I know every passenger on this train, and I consider myself responsible for each of them. 
 How unpleasant. 
 ♪ 
 I care about these passengers, Kevin. 
 That’s a warning. 
 We’ll be back tomorrow for your questionnaires. 
 ♪ 
 Hey, keep moving. 
 [grunts] 
 Alex. 
 I know. 
 I’m Javier–Javi. 
 Fifth Engineer. Sit. 
 Please don’t touch anything unless I tell you to. 
 That panel’s new, no? 
 It’s not new. 
 It’s overhauled. I upgraded the interface on the second revolution. 
 Please don’t touch anything. 
 It’s from Snowpiercer. 
 It’s actually a joke from your mom. 
 We had it out there for years. I thought you’d like it. 
 Don’t butter me up, okay? 
 Wilford tapped you as an Engineer. 
 You’re gonna stick to that. 
 You know… when your mom came back from here, she said you weren’t just technically good. 
 She said you had the touch. 
 Well, do you have the touch? 
 Mas o menos. Not like your mom. 
 Just keep us on the track. 
 Ok–where are you going? 
 Uptrain. 
 It’s a big day on Snowpiercer. I’m sorry you’re not invited. 
 Brought her up from Big Alice, one of my favorites. 
 You see how the bodies are entwined? 
 Can’t tell whether they’re fighting or… 
 Well, you know. 
 What do you think, Bess Till? 
 I think a lot of the passengers are concerned. 
 People keep disappearing. 
 Mm. 
 Layton and now Brakeman Roche and his family. 
 You’re a curious creature. 
 I don’t know what to do with you. 
 Eight of our Breachmen murdered, I could…find the killers, close the case. 
 You see, “Train Detective” is a Melanie invention. 
 I never needed one. 
 You know why? 
 No, sir. 
 Because there wasn’t any crime on my train. 
 There is no crime, only order. 
 I don’t think you’re that naïve. 
 And I don’t think you’re that innocent. 
 ♪ 
 [chuckles] Very well. 
 You can tell the passengers Mr. Roche is in a Drawer along with his family. 
 When you all settle down, they can rejoin us. 
 That won’t go over well. 
 I know. 
 But I have just the tonic. 
 Sikes, take her down to car 272. 
 And don’t worry about Mr. Layton. 
 We’ve made him quite at home. 
 [ominous music] 
 ♪ 
 Now I know you’re just following Wilford’s order, but I have a right to know what you’ve done to me. 
 You found out prematurely. 
 Yeah, I put my hand in the cold lock, and it didn’t fall off. 
 [sighs] 
 What does he want with me? 
 Please. [chuckles] 
 [keyboard clacking] 
 When you arrived with us-[chuckles] 
 You don’t need to show me that. 
 I lived through every second of it. 
 We repaired you. 
 Yes, thank you. 
 You took the pain away, but you… you have done something to my body without my consent! 
 Honey. 
 Josie… what did it feel like when you put your hand in the chamber? 
 [soft dramatic music] 
 ♪ 
 It was a rush, wasn’t it? 
 ♪ 
 I didn’t sign up to be the next Icy Bob. 
 You are orders of magnitude beyond our Bob. 
 You want to know more? Let’s see what’s possible. 
 Oh, for Pete’s sake, will you slow down, Kevin? 
 Ruth, this is the big surprise. 
 He’s opening Car 272, and he’s putting me in charge! 
 Car 272 has been closed for years. 
 Wait! 
 [gasps] 
 I need a kid. 
 Come here. 
 Come on. 
 Come on, let’s go. 
 Come on, Winnie, it’s all right. 
 It’s all right.

 Oh, my goodness. 
 Ta-da! 
 He’ll be here in a jiff. Grand opening is tonight. 
 Ah! 
 Sit. Stay. 
 [laughs] 
 Hey. 
 Hey, hey, hey, those aren’t for teenagers. 
 Come get–Alex. Alex. 
 Don’t be ridiculous. Get down. 
 Wilford put Roche and his family in the Drawers. 
 Roche in the Drawer, Javi on Big Alice, and Layton’s in his compost. 
 And now this sh1t show. 
 Oh, oh, okay, here it comes. 
 Tech rehearsal’s starting. 
 Everybody, up, up, up. 
 ♪ 
 [confetti cannons boom] 
 [applause] 
 Bravo. 
 Whoo! 
 What an entrance! 
 Mr. Wilford! 
 Wonderful, that was really good. 
 Perfect timing. It’s marvelous, isn’t it, eh? 
 Yeah. 
 Don’t like that. Get rid of it. 
 Line the stage for the puppeteers. 
 There we go. 
 Come along. 
 You see this? Gather ’round. 
 Special preview– an epic saga for the masses. 
 [sighs] 
 Good luck. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 [whistle blows] 
 [imitating train sounds] 
 At last, my beloved Snowpiercer and all of the people I’ve missed. 
 Soon I’m gonna see my Mama! 
 [laughs] 
 Whee, Wilford! 
 I’m Head Engineer Melanie. Choo, choo. 
 I will prove that cold is hot! 
 I’m going to climb that frozen mountain and send a balloon. 
 They’ve gone mad without us. 
 [laughs] 
 Observe. 
 Don’t go, Mama! 
 Don’t go! [cries loudly] 
 [laughs] 
 This isn’t funny. 
 [cries loudly] 
 [muffled speech] 
 Don’t worry. You’re all safe on my train. 
 The Engine will provide.

 I’m dead. [gong rings]

 The Engine will provide. The Engine will provide. 
 The Engine will provide. [train horn toots]

 Bravo, bravo. 
 [soft dramatic music] 
 Bravo indeed. Did you like that? 
 Yeah. 
 It was good, wasn’t it? 
 [chuckles] 
 Oh, come on. What’s wrong with you all? 
 Liar! 
 What a pathetic attempt. 
 You can’t kill Melanie with this propaganda. 
 We don’t have extra time. We’re already a day late. 
 I don’t think you paid close enough attention to the ending, Alex. 
 I got a peek at the launch data that you so carefully doctored. 
 Ben lost contact with Melanie ten days ago. 
 ♪ 
 [whispering] You did? 
 Towards the end of the launches, yes, we lost contact, but Melanie is a survivor, and she received enough data to complete a climate model. 
 All right, all right, back to the Engine. 
 Don’t give up on her, Alex. 
 Ruth, escort them forward. 
 You have my evening to prepare. 
 ♪ 
 With respect, you can go ahead and lock up Layton, but you’ll find a bit of his fight in all of us now. 
 ♪ 
 Private event this evening for a very select few. 
 Thank you. 
 Could I also bring my boyfriend? 
 He’s the head of Janitorial. 
 Yes. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you, Kevin. 
 Dress your next advice in evening wear. 
 Here you go. 
 ♪ 
 Everybody, look sharp. 
 Mr. Wilford will be through with the carnival soon, and then the real show begins. 
 Those are bordeaux glasses. We’re serving zinfandel. 
 Yes. 
 Ah, I’ll be right back… 
 [elegant music] 
 [under breath] Dear me. 
 Now repeat it back to me. 
 Tell our friends. 
 Get a message to Josie to find Layton in Compost. 
 We’re not giving up on Melanie or our dream of getting off this train. 
 We’re not giving up-[knocking at door] 
 What do you want? 
 Compliments of the carnival. 
 Ow! There’s more. 
 An invitation to dinner. [sighs in pain] 
 Ah. 
 Winnie, tonight when Wilford’s busy, Josie has to find Layton, okay? 
 We need his help. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [chuckling] Oh.

 No.

 Oh! 
 Ah. 
 [laughing intensely] 
 Against the wall! 
 ♪ 
 You come to me in my dreams, you know? 
 Rather spooky. 
 Ugh. 
 Is that why you haven’t stuck my head out a port yet? 
 [chuckles] 
 Honest question. 
 Hanging on to your ideals, being beloved by your people uptrain, do you think it makes the slightest difference in the end? 
 Yeah, it does. 
 Well, for the life of me, I can’t see how. 
 I suppose there must be something uniquely wrong with me. 
 You’re not unique, Wilford. 
 You’re an old, white dictator with a train set. 
 Fragile, powerful men like you froze the Earth in the first place. 
 Yes, it’s a PR problem in that regard. 
 I haven’t got any of your stuff left, have I? 
 That musky smell of integrity. 
 When that washes off, it’s a wrap for you. 
 You’ll always have your little followers, but the majority will never love you like you want them to. 
 [shovel scraping] 
 The will of the people-how can you stand it? 
 Every little faction. 
 The cold heart of political power is obedience. 
 That sh1t right there is why we’ll always be enemies. 
 [chuckles] Well, I feel better. 
 I’m dining uptrain tonight with the last of your friends. Zarah has some decisions to make. 
 So are you feeling loved now? 
 Up to your elbows in their sh1t. 
 [laughs] 
 Your open heart, Mr. Layton, it telegraphs your every move.

 [grunts] 
 [shouts]

 [under breath] Oh, my God. 
 Oh, places, everybody. Lucky winners are here. 
 Yes, ma’am. 
 [gasps] 
 Holy crap. 
 No thanks. 
 I’m back. 
 [quietly] Should have bloody known. 
 What are we in for, Ruth, the last supper? 
 This whole day’s one long dark display. 
 He told me the tickets were for random guests. 
 Kevin dropped this on me after keeping me locked up all day for my comfort. 
 If Wilford threatens her baby, I’m gonna kill him with my butter knife. 
 All right, take it easy. 
 I’ll run interference as best I can. 
 Right, everybody, welcome. 
 You lucky few. 
 While the rest of the train takes in the carnival, you winners get to enjoy a more intimate evening with Mr. Wilford. 
 Yeah. 
 I’m a fish out of water, man. What’s this all about? 
 I don’t know, but like your mother used to tell you, keep your head on a swivel. 
 You guys are freaking out. 
 Right, I’m actually super excited. 
 What about you, Alex? Are you “super excited”? 
 I think we’re all screwed. 
 [glasses clatter] 
 Oh, dear me. 
 [laughter] 
 Of course it is! 
 Hello, everybody! [laughing] 
 Bloody Audrey. 
 Ugh. 
 Oh, I just want to stand here and gaze upon you all. 
 Oh, come down, Joseph. There’s no need to bellow. 
 I love an eccentric table of guests, don’t you? 
 Mix it up with old friends and new. 
 [laughs] 
 Mmm. 
 Indulge our palates with a few dwindling delicacies. 
 Isn’t that the ticket, Ruth? 
 You’re in charge of tickets, sir, as it ever was.

 Of course, I knew your parents. 
 You’re new to me, Mr. Osweiller. 
 And I believe you two know each other. 
 Ex-Brakeman partners. 
 That’s correct, sir. 
 Yeah. 
 That’s fascinating. 
 Mm. 
 [chuckles] 
 Oh, but Alex, I don’t think you’ve met Zarah. 
 She’s with Hospitality. 
 Also Andre Layton’s partner. 
 It’s nice to meet you, Alex. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Ex-wife, wasn’t it, Audrey? 
 Mm, a Tail divorce. It sort of counts, doesn’t it? 
 All those years in the Nightcar… all those personal things that we told you. 
 It was her calling, helping us open up and grieve. 
 Yeah, so she could sell our secrets like a whore. 
 Now, now, now, now. 
 What did Mr. Layton say? We’re all one train together. 
 Exactly. 
 I thought dinner would be a nice way to bring us all together again. 
 One train under God and Audrey. 
 [quietly] She didn’t like the puppet show. 
 [laughs] 
 Really? ‘Cause I thought it was hilarious. 
 Oh, did you? Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, Melanie’s not as pure as everyone around here thinks she is. 
 LJ. 
 I think Mr. Wilford’s heard enough about Melanie for one night, LJ. 
 
 
 
 I haven’t. 
 I would love to hear more lies about my mother, Lilah. 
 [chuckles] Mmm. 
 Well, she was the liar. 
 She wanted to be you. 
 She accused me of a crime, and I found out her little secret, so she had to overturn the verdict. 
 I’m puzzled, LJ. 
 If Melanie overturned the verdict, does that mean you were guilty? 
 ♪ 
 I, uh… 
 Uh, no, um… 
 So you did not cut off those men’s penises like I read about in the transcript? 
 I am so relieved. [laughs] 
 Is that true, Lilah? 
 Lilah Junior is a good person, Mr. Wilford. 
 Oh, yes. 
 She fell a long way from First when her parents passed. 
 She learned to work, sir. 
 She knows the train now, and I’m proud of her. 
 He speaks. [chuckles] 
 Osweiller from the East Midlands. 
 You’re even quieter than your partner, Trusty Till, though a little more romantic, huh? 
 [chuckles] 
 My intentions with Lilah Junior are sound, sir. 
 How lovely. Did you hear that, Audrey? 
 Yeah, and he meant it. 
 Tell me, Mr. Osweiller, my previous head of Janitorial, Terence, I brought from my buildings in New York. 
 How did you come to be in his shoes? 
 Sir, those were chaotic times. 
 We lost a lot of people in the troubles. 
 We’ve tried to fill in as best we could. 
 A simple question for an AWOL Brakeman and a girl who put out her father’s eye with a fork. 
 Think very carefully about this, Mr. Osweiller. 
 Why should I keep you? 
 Answer me, boy. 
 May I? 
 [quietly] Os, what are you doing? 
 Does he play? 
 I have no idea. 
 It’s been a while, if you’ll forgive me…
