 ♪ 
 On the eve of our 19th revolution, the great Mr. Wilford came out of the cold. 
 ♪ 
 It was the time of two Engines. The Tail no longer The Tail, but a borderland.

 A time of great gamesmanship and great trainsmanship…

 Of revolutions interrupted and fresh track on new terrain.

 Snowpiercer is dead in the water. You will comply with Mr. Wilford’s demands or we will disconnect and leave you hear to flounder. 
 Tell Mr. Wilford the people of Snowpiercer will never surrender. 
 Who are you exactly? 
 I’m the guy whose backdoor you just kicked in. 
 I’m sure that we can all accommodate one another. Mr. Layton means no disrespect. 
 Yeah, we can discuss when we’re moving. 
 That sounds reasonable, Alex. Your mother would agree, I’m sure. 
 How do we make that happen? 
 Bring me everything on this list.

 Beer? 
 Carrots and cucumbers. 
 We have to get all this? 
 [All] [anxious murmurs] 
 You have about 12 minutes before it’s too cold to move. 
 Hey, hey, hey! 
 It’s just–it’s trifles. 
 We don’t have a choice. 
 Hardlines are down and the subtrain. 
 Okay, we gotta do this by runner! From the brewery, we need six bottles Railman’s Ale. 
 On it! Make way! 
 From the library, somebody get a copy of “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier. Ruth, you’re with me. 
 Yeah. 
 Roche, hold the line. 
 Got it! 
 Ag-Sec. 
 Here! 
 Till, go with. We need one bunch carrots, one cucumber, six eggs, and a hen. 
 A hen? 
 Yep. 
 Ugh. 
 Javi, have you got comms with Mel? 
 We’re stopped. 
 Yeah, I got that. 
 Have you got comms with her? 
 I’ve got nothing. Ben Wilford’s got complete control of Snowpiercer. 
 She’ll know. She’ll know to go to backup.

 Melanie, Melanie, come in, this is the Engine. 
 [sighs] Beautiful day out here. 
 ♪ 
 Yeah, a balmy 118 below zero. Let’s get you back aboard. 
 I’m at the connector. The arms are locked in. 
 Hey, Mel, you can’t disconnect us. 
 I know. We drained the banks too low running from him to ever get moving on our own again. You were right, Ben. I fell for it.

 No, listen. I hear something. 
 Hey, everyone, quiet a second! 
 [metal clanking] 
 sh1t, someone’s outside. 
 You think it’s one of us? 
 I got a hunch it is. 
 Whatever they’re doing, I hope it works. 
 Minus 12.

 Sorry, Snowpiercer ran out of morphine yesterday. 
 What? And what if Mr. Wilford is in distress back there? 
 First class china, just hand it off to the next guy; he’s right outside. 
 He’s really still alive. 
 Yeah, the last item on the list is a bottle of Mr. Wilford’s favorite Scotch.

 It’s 22.

 [machinery buzzing, whirring] 
 How many Tailies we got left down here? 
 Only about half, I figure. 
 Some have got berths already, but most are just camping out uptrain. 
 Some of us don’t wanna leave. 
 Look, here’s where I’m going with this. The Tail is not The Tail anymore. It’s a border, and you have to control a border, so keep a force strong enough back here to hold the real estate. 
 Seven years we’ve been trying to get out of this place, and now the place is finally worth something. 
 Let’s get organized. 
 ♪ 
 I think we should build a second barricade right here. 
 Yeah, good idea. Keep strengthening this area. If he’s prepared to stop the train, we have to assume that he’s prepared to attack. 
 I would advise against assumptions, Mr. Layton. If we don’t talk to the passengers soon, I swear the track talk will eat us alive. Hard comms back up. 
 Thank you, Ruth. I will address the train right after a council meeting in the Nightcar immediately.

 Name, rank, and serial number. That’s all you get. 
 Sorry. [chuckles] Too eager. Never expected we’d come face to face so quickly. Did you? It’s Ben, though, isn’t it? You’ve always had an eye for talent. 
 ♪ 
 Why don’t we talk about you? How’d you do it? Come on. How’d you drop in on us in Chicago like that? I know you’re dying to tell me. 
 Yes, finally. I love a good swashbuckler, don’t you? You’ve probably figured out some of it. I got Alice to low idle, managed to hunker down in a shed for a couple of months. By the time you were on the other side of the world out of satellite view, we were outfitted. I was always working, Melanie, waiting for my moment to pounce. Voilà.

 I’ll tell you everything when you give me the keys.

 Oh, you will. You may have cut my uplink, but I can still drop anchor and grind you to a halt. 
 ♪ 
 Snowpiercer won’t survive more than 20 minutes if you disconnect. 
 It’s ironic, isn’t it? My protégé. You run away from me all these years, and all of a sudden, you just can’t bear to be apart from me. I want my train back, Melanie. 
 Actually, you still ran her until very recently. 
 What’s that supposed to mean? 
 Means I found it easier to keep you alive. I convinced people you were still in the Engine, but I lost control. She’s not mine to surrender. 
 Then whose is she? 
 A Tailie’s. 
 And what is a Tailie? 
 I won’t give you anything no matter what you do to me, and I know you want me to suffer. You can’t hurt me anymore, not really.

 Hello, Melanie. 
 [dog barks, growls]

 [whispers] Alex. You’re–you’re alive. 
 I am distinctly underwhelmed. 
 Life’s big moments are often like that. 
 Whatever he told you, it isn’t true. 
 You stole a train, and then you left me. What’s not true about that? 
 No, I sent people for you. For you–for you and for Grandma and Grandpa, but they never came back. I was waiting for you. 
 But stealing the future from me was more important, wasn’t it? 
 Alex, please. There’s–there’s too much to say. 
 God, yes, change the subject. 
 Their society is in shambles up there, but Ag-Sec is working. 
 [chuckles] Oh… Oh, good. Poultry, eggs. First-class dining hasn’t derailed off a cliff. 
 They were out of morphine… 
 Oh. 
 And I didn’t see any Jackboots. 
 Must have been painful. You know what a Tailie is? 
 No, but a man named Layton appears to be in charge, along with who I assume is Lead Brakeman Roche and the blonde from Hospitality. 
 Hmm, never heard of a Mr. Layton. Apparently your mother’s been impersonating me up there. Do they miss me? 
 Well, the Hospitality’s still in uniform. 
 Oh. [chuckles] Miss Audrey… [sniffs] Still with us. 
 Hello. Is everyone getting along? 
 No. Take Melanie to the brig. 
 Yes, ma’am. 
 ♪ 
 [whispers] Look at me, honey. 
 Calmly now. Don’t make it worse. 
 [door opens] 
 Please, please! 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Yes, we have full engineering control, but Big Alice is like an anchor controlling our speed. 
 The supply train, that’s built for a crew of what, 60? 
 Give or take, but there’s no way for us to know how she’s been retrofitted. 
 All right, what’s her maximum crew size? 
 Guess. 
 Guess? 200, but probably less, and our Engineer is their prisoner. 
 The passengers are tired of war. Am I wrong? 
 [people shouting indistinctly] 
 She’s clearly not wrong. Everyone’s exhausted. We need to recover. 
 They haven’t invaded, have they? So let’s just have a cooling-off period. 
 Please, yes, open talks with him. 
 Melanie’s probably back there right now working things out with Mr. Wilford and her daughter. 
 [indistinct shouts] 
 Mr. Wilford… doesn’t just want control of his train. He wants control of all of you, body and soul. 
 That’s right, don’t trust him! 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Hey, quiet down. Quiet! A 40-car parasite does not call the shots around here. Snowpiercer does! 
 [cheers and applause] 
 All right, we hold fast. Call it a cooling off if you want to, Ruth, but we do not start talks until Wilford turns over Melanie. 
 All right, you heard the man. Our first priority, our responsibility, is to keep Snowpiercer calm and fed and united, same as it ever was. 
 [tense music] 
 Let’s get a force together quickly, quietly. Keep Ruth out of it. 
 No, we can’t attack them. We basically have no idea what’s behind that door. 
 What about Melanie? 
 Melanie is the reason we have to do this. Okay, look, I know everyone is tired, but Wilford’s got a plan. We need to hit him before he hits us. 
 Look who it is. 
 [speaking foreign language] 
 Whoa, whoa, where you think you’re going? 
 Don’t touch me. 
 Yeah, or what? 
 Just a warning, Mr. Layton, your laundry’s about to flap. 
 sh1t. 
 [speaking foreign language] 
 That’s enough. 
 No, no, you’re not going anywhere. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Back up. Come on. 
 Z-Wreck, Strong Boy, what’s wrong with you? 
 Layton, she sold out Josie. 
 What, she don’t gotta pay for that on your new train? 
 Look, Melanie was threatening her, okay? 
 And she cracked. Now Josie’s dead. 
 Hey, hey. 
 I’m pregnant, all right? 
 Is that true? 
 Zarah? 
 Yes, it is. 
 A pregnancy on Snowpiercer. It’s hope. 
 Melanie was threatening our child. 
 Your child? 
 [speaks foreign language] 
 Oh, my goodness, this changes everything. All right, you two, go on, shove off. Leave the woman alone. 
 What? No, we still got– 
 Back to whatever hallway where you’re sleeping in. 
 This ain’t right. Let me tell you something, Layton. All this personal sh1t, it ain’t making your democracy any easier to believe in. [scoffs] 
 So you can’t stay in the chains, Zarah. Carrying your child, she might be a target. I will find somewhere for you uptrain away from all the ruckus, okay? Now, we really must address the passengers. … I am on the side of Snowpiercer, Mr. Layton. I work for the passengers, just like you. 
 Good. 
 Well, speak your truth. That’s how they seem to trust you. 
 [intercom chimes] 
 Citizens of Snowpiercer, it took us seven long years to cast off Wilford’s class system, and now the man is back and latched on to The Tail. We know he is willing to stop us cold, but Brakemen and the rebel army have control of the new border. Ruth Wardell and Hospitality will lead diplomatic initiatives, and Snowpiercer will use all means necessary to defend the liberties we’ve won. 
 [solemn music] 
 But… 
 ♪ 
 With everything we have sacrificed, it is my great regret and my reluctant duty to put our democratic experiment on hold and to extend martial law until further notice.

 That, my half-ass warrior friends, means trouble comes. 
 That will not be popular. 
 What choice does he have?

 Nematodes will survive. 
 Yeah. Yeah, nematodes will. 
 Are you frostbit? 
 A little bit, but it’s fine. Just broke the seal on my suit. 
 I remember less and less of it– the old world. 
 That’s a shame. I’m sorry you couldn’t spend more time in it. 
 The train is our world now. We can control this. 
 What? What happened with Grandma and Grandpa? 
 They wouldn’t leave with the men that you sent. 
 They wanted to die at home. 
 They said I should go, but I didn’t wanna leave them. 
 [chuckles] You know… [sighs] I sent you away to live with them for a reason. 
 Why? Because you had a train to steal so you didn’t need a daughter anymore? 
 To keep you from him. 
 He’s the one who saved me after you left me. 
 That’s not why he saved you. 
 What is this? It was in your suit. 
 It’s a snow sample. 
 Well, why’d you take a snow sample? 
 Because I haven’t been off Snowpiercer in seven years. 
 You are lying to me again.

 Ruth, she can’t be up here in First. 
 Why not? 
 Come on, Zarah. How’s it look? 
 I don’t care how it looks. I care about the baby. 
 You are going to need a place, Mr. Layton, a base of operations for day-to-day administration. You can use this whole floor. There are separate accommodations upstairs. Pregnancy comes with privilege on Snowpiercer. 
 We don’t know how to thank you, Ruth. I don’t know how you pulled this off. 
 Well, everyone’s bending rules these days, aren’t they, Mr. Layton? 
 What happened to the chic owners? 
 It was the Schwartz Car. They were in their 80s. They took cyanide the morning the Tailie army took the train, so it would be nice to let some joy back in, wouldn’t it, hmm? With a little ‘un running around? Two security chips. Your door keys. You’re welcome.

 I’m taking her back, Mel. If you can’t get this Layton to surrender my train, Alex will disconnect, and we’ll take a short spin in reverse. When we return, they’ll all be dead, and your job for the next several years will be to compost every last one of them.

 It’s kind of the only solution, really. We just have to find a way to work together. 
 She got you, Dubs. 
 Shut up. 
 Really don’t have a choice.
