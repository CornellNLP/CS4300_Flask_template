 ♪ 
 I was ten when the world became a train. 
 ♪ 
 Wilford said he was my family now. 
 Daddy Dubs. 
 And I would lead the train with him. 
 ♪ 
 Leaders were lonely. 
 You couldn’t trust anyone. 
 ♪ 
 So I was the island of Alex, and no one ever came ashore. 
 ♪ 
 Until we finally caught up to Melanie… 
 ♪ 
 And I saw Snowpiercer and met her people. 
 ♪ 
 That’s when Dubs got weird. 
 ♪ 
 Do you know what an oubliette is? 
 A French dungeon. 
 A special dungeon underground with a tiny hole in the roof. 
 They just drop you in forever. It means forget. 
 Melanie, Layton, drop them all in the oubliette, eh? 
 You don’t want me to forget them. 
 You want me to renounce them. 
 Uptrain when you’re ready. 
 At first, I thought my mom and her people were stupid and disorganized, but now I think freedom probably has to be messy. 
 Over there, I saw Layton lead by listening to others. 
 Ugh. 
 I saw women with power. 
 And I saw them keep my mother’s dream alive. 
 Our friend is quite careful. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, our way out is through him. 
 Tonight, if we’re gonna have any shot of getting back to Melanie. 
 Qualities that got us this far won’t get us past Wilford. 
 To best a man like that… you need to be utterly ruthless. 
 We’ve both done terrible things. 
 Not terrible enough. 
 Well, I’ve got a foul and murderous plot to get us out of here, if you’d like to start there. 
 I would. 
 I’ve watched Wilford. 
 Seen him take it right up to the edge of killing us all, so the question is not, 
 “Are you willing to sink to his level?”

 It’s, “Are you willing to risk everything?”

 Oh, this is the engine. 
 Now we need to go one more up. 
 Ruth? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Alex. 
 We’ve just found out. Your mum, she’s alive. 
 [gasps] 
 I knew it. I knew it. 
 She’s there. She’s waiting for us. 
 We’re gonna steal Big Alice and go get her. 
 With a shovel? 
 Well, any assistance would be appreciated. 
 How about the engine has a secret entrance to Wilford’s bedroom? 
 All right, she’s in. 
 We’re crossing the Rocky Mountain Test Track today. 
 We need both engines to make that turn. 
 Okay, so we’ll need Ben too, but let’s get you out of here first. 
 No, I can get myself out of here. 
 Wilford wants me to kiss the ring. 
 I can get Kevin to take me to him. 
 Okay. 
 So about the secret entrance? 
 Audrey? 
 Audrey, am I the only one working today? 
 You’re an early riser, though, aren’t you, Bess? 
 And a night prowler. I like that in an advisor. 
 I’m not your advisor if you won’t listen to my advice. 
 Is Zarah coming around? 
 She physically rejected dinner and threatened me with a fork. 
 What if we offered her Voice of the Train? 
 You’re not gonna buy her with Layton in your gulag. 
 Well, she’d do it with convincing. I’d happily slap her. 
 Huh? 
 What? 
 Now, why did I do that? 
 Hmm? 
 Poor impulse control? 
 And because pregnancy comes with privilege on Snowpiercer. 
 Exactly. 
 Zarah’s privileged. 
 She has that ineffable royal Layton jelly. 
 Kevin, we want some of that. 
 Royal jelly. 
 My mistake, sir, of course. 
 What’s going sideways now, Joe? 
 Hair of the dog, Audrey. 
 Time to play doula. 
 Ugh, Zarah. 
 Keep going.

 We need to let Ben know we’re ready to pick up Melanie. 
 Great, okay. 
 How do we do that? 
 Just give me a moment.

 Oh, this is gonna be bad.

 When it happened I felt my skin crack, and stretch, and, yeah, I was really scared. 
 But now? 
 [dramatic music] 
 Now, I want to go out there, want to see what I can do. 
 Melanie left on a fool’s errand. 
 Again? 
 She was a fool to leave. 
 Her team deserved her punishment, and so did I. 
 Does she sound sincere to you? 
 I believe so. 
 I am sorry, Joseph. 
 I shouldn’t have said that stuff at dinner, and I’ll make sure to apologize to Miss Audrey, as well.
