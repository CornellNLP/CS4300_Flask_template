 Man : Previously, on "Freakish." 
 The water's out. 
 We have another option. 
 Yeah? 
 When they built the fallout shelter, they stocked it with gas masks. 
 And that's good why? 
 Because it means we can get the masks and the tanks and get out of here. 
 [growling] 
 No one has my back. 
 That's not true. 
 These are all useless... 
 All of them except this one. 
 So only one of us can leave. 
 [tense music] 
 ♪ ♪ Okay, so only one of us can go outside and look for help. We're drawing names. Everybody except Natalie. No. No, I don't want to be treated differently. In your state, you'd be at a distinct disadvantage if you go out there. He's right. ♪ ♪ Diesel. It's all right. See if we need to make any adjustments. Put it on. Hey, is something wrong? Just give me a minute. I just don't like feeling closed in. You're claustrophobic? No. [clears throat] I'll be fine. [sniffs] [sighs] [breathes deeply] [clears throat] [breathes deeply] [breathing erratically] [gasping] He can't go out there. Give him a chance. We can't waste our one mask on someone who might hyperventilate before he finds help. Come here. Dude, hey. Look, I can do this, okay? Hey. [breathes deeply] It's okay. [breathes deeply] [grunts] Back to the lottery. LeSean. No. No. No, this isn't right! I'll be okay. It should be Diesel! Diesel can't do it. You know he would if he could. I'll be all right. You sure this sh1t gonna protect me? About as sure as I am the gas mask will. Uh, so, thank our dependable school security guard for keeping walkie-talkies in his locker. Your primary goal is to get to the fire station. If it's still there. It's the most likely place to find people, and if not, there should be a communication system so you can call for help. And if none of that works, raid a fridge and bring us back some water. All right, got it. Do you have your phone? Yeah. Is it fully charged? Close enough. But you always say that it's almost always dead, so. I have it charged. Well, maybe we should just be sure and check. Hey. He shouldn't need to use his phone that much. It's unlikely he'd drain his battery. Yeah, but what if he does? What if you find a signal and then your phone dies? You need to go out there with it fully charged. I'll be okay. I'm coming back. I promise. You can't promise that, you don't know. I promise. Stay strong. [sniffs] [rhythmic music] ♪ ♪ [sighs] Good luck, man. Let's do it. [sobs] [door opening and closing] [eerie music] ♪ ♪ No! No! No! Hey! No! LeSean! There's a freak behind him! Hey, get away from him! This way! This way! Away from him! LeSean, can you hear me? There's a freak behind you. It's coming right behind you! Hey! Hey! Hey! [eerie music] ♪ ♪ [mellow music] ♪ ♪ Man : ♪ Can you see? ♪ I'm afraid of spiders. ♪ ♪ Everybody has something. What if LeSean doesn't make it? Don't this to yourself. If he dies, that'll be my fault. ♪ ♪ Man : ♪ Sweet time is a river ♪ 
♪ Castaway ♪ You should focus on what you  can  do, and what you've done. You've protected us... all of us at one time or another. You built the barricades. [scoffs] Come on, anybody could do that. I know it sucks that LeSean had to take your place, but there's not much you can do about it now. Things don't always work out the way we want. ♪ ♪ You know what I'd be doing right now if today were a normal day? I'd be prepping for a debate on this stage. ♪ ♪ Think you would've won? The debate, yes. The election, no. But I should've won both. What do you mean? I had a big list of things I wanted to get done if I were elected... big things down to little things like getting seating in the lobby. [laughs] So when you're waiting to see the principal, you have a place to sit. Or when you're waiting for your ride to get you. Uh, yeah, that. It all seems so ridiculous now. ♪ ♪ Look at these seats. There might not even be enough students left alive to fill them. ♪ ♪ [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 Still no word? Nothing. You don't have to stay. You shouldn't be alone. I'm fine. Why haven't I heard from him? I mean, he would've radioed by now if he could, right? Let's go upstairs. We might get a better signal. Until we figure out how the freaks got into the science wing, we need to assume more are coming. Want to go find some leaks and plug 'em up? Yeah. [eerie music] ♪ ♪ Psst! Somebody's been sleeping here. Looks like she was attacked. Maybe bit. Okay, you tell Zoe. I'll go find Natalie. [growls] Mrs. Viedra. [growls] [dramatic music] [both struggling] ♪ ♪ [grunts] [groans] Come on! ♪ ♪ Go! ♪ ♪ In here! In here! Come on, come on, come on! [grunts] [growls] So now what? [growling] We figure something out. [growls] [pounds on the door] We're doing this? Oh, we're doing this. Now. [growls] [screams] [yells] [panting] Oh, my God. [panting] That was my biology teacher. I had to. [sad music] ♪ ♪ [Rogue Valley's "The Wolves and the Ravens"] ♪ ♪ Man and woman : ♪ In the morning by the sea ♪ 
♪ As the fog clears from the sand ♪ 
♪ Have no money in my hand ♪ 
♪ Have no home I have no land ♪ 
♪ But it doesn't trouble me ♪ You waiting for a ride? You waiting to see the principal? [chuckles] Man and woman : ♪ I am easy to inspire ♪ I know you think it's a little pointless anyway, but... No. It's really sweet. Thank you. Man : ♪ Though I've wished from time to time ♪ Did you move this yourself? Yeah. Yeah, me and, uh, Lyle worked for a moving company last summer. You know, we learned all the tricks. That sounds like a hard job. Well, you know, some people in the middle of moving get a little high strung. "Don't scratch the furniture, don't break the china"? Yeah, don't drink the beer. Don't take naps on the pool table. That Lyle, right? [chuckles] If you say so. [both laughing] ♪ ♪ [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ [radio static] Hello? Lesean : Zoe. [chuckles] What took you so long? Lesean : You know, too many freaks around, I had to be quiet. [sighs] I see emergency lights up ahead. Oh, my God. That's so great. I'm gonna get closer. [peaceful music] ♪ ♪ This is really nice. Yeah. ♪ ♪ Uh, um, I'm sorry. Uh... I-I gotta go. [chuckles] I don't... I don't know what I was thinking. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [engine running] Lesean : sh1t. What? What is it? Lesean : Paramedics are dead. Zoe : LeSean? All clear inside. LeSean. I'm going for the radio. I see it. Creature : [growls] [groans] Hey! LeSean! LeSean! LeSean! LeSean? Answer me. J-just say anything. Are you there? [sad music] ♪ ♪ [sobs] ♪ ♪ [engine running] Maybe he fought back. He's strong. We haven't heard from him in three hours. We can stay here and die from dehydration, or we can risk it and go out there and find water and find help. With no masks? We're out of options. Who's in? I'm in. We stick together, right? Guys... want somebody to promise me something. If I ever turn freak or any of that sh1t, you'll end it. I'll do it. [laughs] Yeah, you're the one person I know would. But seriously, I don't want to be left out in the open... okay? I want someone to bury me. Now, that I'm not doing. Too much work. That's fair enough. Okay. When I bury you, what do you want on your grave? Dirt. Okay. And on your headstone? I don't know, just the basics. My name, when I was born, when I died. [indistinct]. What would you want on your grave? His is gonna be shaped like a... big dollar sign. [laughs] No, it wouldn't. It would be several dollar signs. [laughter] Oh, my God. [laughter] [droning music] ♪ ♪ Can I sit? ♪ ♪ I'm sorry for running off earlier. Don't worry about it. I misread things. No, but you didn't. Now I  am  confused. Look, I don't think you realize the kind of person I am. I know exactly what kind of person you are. Do you know why I was in detention? 'Cause I beat the crap out of a guy, okay? They were about to kick me out. It doesn't matter. It does matter. If we weren't stuck in here, you wouldn't even look at me. I wouldn't have had the chance to get to know you, so yeah, you're probably right. But you wouldn't have given me the time of day either. We're in here... so none of it matters. I know you now. You know what, forget it. I don't want to have to convince someone to kiss me. [dramatic music] [pounding on the door] ♪ ♪ Holy sh1t. Oh, my God. ♪ ♪
