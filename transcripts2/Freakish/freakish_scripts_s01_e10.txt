 Woman : Previously, on "Freakish"... 
 Stay strong. 
 Good luck, man. 
 Let's do it. 
 John Collins. Rescue and Recovery. 
 We leave in five minutes. 
 Both : [laugh, exhale] 
 We have a vaccine. 
 All of you happen to believe a man who has a suitcase full of shots which are all poison. 
 How long have we been out? 
 Couple minutes, I think. 
 What does he want from us? 
 Just a pinch. 
 Okay. 
 [suspenseful music] 
 [grunts] 
 I can't break free. 
 I know how to do this. 
 Uhh! 
 I guess... you saw that in a movie once. 
 Uhh... 
 I'm not a fan of needles. 
 Nobody is. 
 [tense music] 
 ♪ ♪ Something wrong? [thud] Uhh! Why did you do that? It's not a vaccine. It's a poison. He's here to kill us. It's a poison? [tense music] ♪ ♪ Two aspirin would kill a guinea pig. So could a shot of vodka. Or a cup of mouthwash. I didn't give it even close to the full dosage. What did you put in my body? A vaccine. To protect you. How do you feel? Fine. I mean, my stomach's a little weird, but... I think it's just nerves. He tied me up. Because you and your friends blew up the chemical plant. But why did you knock me out? Diesel? It's pretty simple. You're saying this is a vaccine, right? Well, that means you wouldn't mind getting, now, would you? [tense music] ♪ ♪ Don't. [exhales] [panting] Why are you trying to kill us? I'm doin' my job. It's because we're witnesses to the horror show going on out there. All I know is... your friend doesn't have to die. What's in the syringe? What kind of poison is it? I don't know. Unlikely. Her only chance is getting medical attention. I can radio for help. Sure. Right after you call for more people to come kill us. Then send me to my vehicle. I have an extra suit. I can get her outta here. You'll go get it and come back, just to be nice? She'll die if you don't trust me. She's dying because we did trust you. Yeah, well, she's not dying alone. [dramatic musical build‐up] ♪ ♪ [eerie music] ♪ ♪ Your girlfriend's dying. Shouldn't you be spending her last moments on earth with her? How are you feeling? The same as 30 seconds ago. Not even like a headache? Oddly enough, I'm getting one now. I just don't know how you can think about anything else. Right now, I feel fine. Maybe Barrett was wrong. [scoffs] Barrett's not usually wrong. Are you trying to make me feel bad? No! Of course not. I'm just worried. Well, I'm not. I'm not thinking about dying at all. I'm not... wondering if it hurts or if I could have done more while I was alive or if anyone's gonna think about me after I'm gone, I... I'm not wondering what it's like. One minute you are, and the next... you just aren't. ♪ ♪ I'm not thinking about it at all. [crying] Collins didn't bring much with him. [ominous music] Let's make sure he doesn't get this. [clatters] What's that? Proof he's not with the government. Well, that makes more sense, at least. He works for the company that made this mess. I wonder how many others like him are out there. [tense music] ♪ ♪ I should thank you for injecting me. There are a million ways to die in this mess. Most are pretty awful. I'll get a bloody nose, heart'll slow down. It'll be harder to breathe, and I'll feel like I'm drowning. But you'll see it with your girlfriend soon enough. Is that right? [scoffs] You did a sh1t job of protecting her. That's about all you're good for around here, right? And you failed. Mmm. That poison doesn't have to be the way you die. But it is gonna be the way she dies. And her baby, too. [dramatic music] [both grunting] [silenced gunshot] Aah! ♪ ♪ [gunshot] [exhales] Ahh... What did you find? What do you mean? Back at the office when you were going through his pack. You found something. Oh, my God. sh1t. Where are they? [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Diesel! [tool clatters] What happened? I got the suit. [exhales] Barrett : At least it's not too bad. Yeah, right. Doesn't look like the bullet hit anything crucial. Thank God. [sighs] How you feeling? I'm fine. You're lucky to be alive. I don't feel lucky. He got the gun. Yeah, but he didn't get the suit. And he can't leave without it. We're like sitting ducks in this office. He's only got four bullets left. You checked? Yeah. [grunts] Well done. Four bullets can still do some damage. We're a much harder target if we're not all together. I'll hide the suit. The rest of you, divide up. Lie low. [dark music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 There. How does that feel? I'm not worried about me. Guys, keep it down. Okay, it's all... Natalie. Your nose. [gasps] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [gunshot] Where's the suit? I'm getting outta here. I‐I don't know. [gunshot] I won't ask again. [muffled whumps] Ah! John : [grunts] Stop! Right there! You might wanna listen. Don't, please. Bring me the suit. You have three minutes. Okay. Okay. Does it hurt? Not really. Good. That's good. Can I get you anything? I mean, you feel like... is there something I can do? Sure. I'm thirsty. I can get water. Be careful. I think she's more worried than you are. She does not wanna be left behind. None of us do. [voice breaking] I don't wanna leave you. [somber music] It feels so cruel... that the world would give us something we never expected... and then take it away before we've had any real time together. Well... the way I see it is... all we've had is real time together. That's not what I mean. Just let me finish. Look, maybe we haven't had a lotta time, but the time that we have had, it's been real. And it's been honest. [shaky breath] And we are who we are in here. I like who we are. [somber music] ♪ ♪ [tense music] You two. Stay. Put it down. Grover, don't. Now, let her go. Back. Up. Grover... You have to let her go. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Get outta my sight. If I see any of you before I leave, I will shoot. Now, go! Violet : What the hell were you thinking? I couldn't let him hurt you. And now we're all going to get killed. Maybe not. I made sure he won't get far. [muffled, soft snarling] [suspenseful music] [soft snarling] ♪ ♪ [clanging] [loud snarling] Is there any sign of him out there? Not yet. He coulda went out the front. What if he's still inside? If he's not out there when it goes off, we're screwed. Wait... there he goes. How much time? Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. [beeping] Huh? [beeping continues] [grunts] All : [snarling, growling] [gunshot] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ All : [snarling, growling] ♪ ♪ All : [snarling] Aah... aah! ♪ ♪ When I was little, I used to cry whenever a book ended. Really? Any kind of book? Comedy... drama... mystery, historical fiction. Didn't matter. I like historical fiction. Really? Yeah. [laughs] [both laughing] Ah, there it goes. That's what I was waiting for. [exhales] So why'd you cry? Same reason everyone cries, I guess. You get to know someone inside and out... And then it's just... the end. And it's over. Yeah, but if the story's good, it sticks with you forever, right? ♪ ♪ You've done so much for me. [sniffles] [whispers] I wish I coulda done more. [whispers] I felt lucky. In the middle of all of this... being here with you. [pensive music] ♪ ♪ [whispers] Yeah, me, too. I'm gonna be all alone. No, you're not. You got all of us. I always spent so much time being mad at her... [sniffles] and for what? [distant thudding] What the hell was that? [thudding, clattering] [pounding, thudding] [loud thudding] Everybody back! Go, go! Oh, my God! All : [snarling, growling] Aah! Aah! ♪ ♪ [overlapping grunting] Arghhh! ♪ ♪ Uhh! Go! [kids grunting] They're breaking through! I don't think we can hold them off! Diesel : We have to fight 'em! Violet : No! We're gonna lose! Grover : We'll just hold the door... we got it! Hey! [snarl] Over here! All : [growling] They're backing off. What's going on? Where's Natalie? Oh, no! No! Go, go! [dramatic music] All : [growling, snarling] [emotional music] ♪ ♪ [emotional music, vocalization] ♪ ♪ [vocalization continues] ♪ ♪ [emotional music continues] ♪ ♪ LeSean! Oh, my God, is that you? [crying] We thought you were dead. They followed me here. I didn't have a choice. [tense music] ♪ ♪
