 Man : Keyword? 
 Flashpoint Zulu.

 Um, my battery is almost out, so I'm making this message for Mom and Papa and... and Ninny, if you find this first, which you always do. 
 It's been two days. 
 We're still trapped in the school. 
 There's no sign of help. 
 We don't know who's out there. 
 We haven't made contact with anyone yet. 
 We're doing our best, but I don't know how long we can last. 
 Dad... 
 I wish we spent more time together. 
 Some of that was on me. 
 And Mom... what can I say? 
 I guess I'm just a disappointment. 
 First failed diet, first election lost, first teen pregnancy. 
 I just thought you should know.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Noodle, are you insane? 
 I'm going crazy, man. 
 I just need normal. 
 You're shooting bricks. Looks pretty normal to me. 
 Oh, really? Think so? 
 Come on, one time. Let's run it, me and you. 
 I'm about to break your ankles. 
 This is not the time, bro. 
 Whoa. 
 You'll never beat me. 
 Ohh! 
 Ever in your life. 
 Whoo.

[suspenseful music] Mary? Mary? Mary, everything is gonna be okay. ♪ ♪ I can't do this. I have a baby in here. I'm like a walking goddamn Happy Meal. So why was it a mistake? What? Having a baby, you said it was a mistake, right? Making a baby was the mistake. Who's the guy? Does it matter? You even know? No. I'm a total slut. Yes, of course I know. It was Model UN in Philly. I was Denmark. He was Greece. So what did he say about the baby? He doesn't know. You didn't even tell him? Hey, where are you going with this? Right here. Sorry. Diesel, what are you doing? No, Diesel! You're right, you can't do this. It's not safe. Diesel! [tense music] ♪ ♪ Looks clear. We can't trust Grover. Not anymore. He cares too much. Isn't that why we should trust him? [scoffs] Don't go bleeding heart on me. It's not like you. You don't know me. I know enough. Don't worry, neither one of us are saints. And what is that supposed to mean? [chuckles] [loud bang] Okay. Stay close. Who's saving who? Hmm, "whom." "Saving whom." ♪ ♪ [all gasp] I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you guys. Any sign of her? No. Cafeteria's clear. I'll take this floor. We'll take upstairs. [tense music] Noodle! Are you insane? Shut up. There's two of us. We have an advantage. Noodle! Shut up. Why don't you start handing out menus? Look, you gotta relax. It's nothing, okay?

 What exactly do you know about me? Can this wait? I'd like to die with a clean conscience. Good luck with that. Look, we all have files about us. You looked at my files? [both panting] Did she get you anywhere? I don't know. No. What happened to your knee? That's not my blood. Noodle. [sighs] It's okay. It's okay. Will you please, please stop talking? Will you just tell me what you know? Look, we've all done things we shouldn't. Sometimes they land us in detention. Sometimes they should land us in jai. I've never been to jail. Lucky you, thief. Look, whatever you found out, it's not what you think. You feel guilty. I get that. But your nagging conscience is embedded deep in your brain, and your brain is about to get ripped out by a freak. So for the love of God... Noodle's dead. Mary's still loose. We tried. Where? The gym lockers, three minutes ago. sh1t. Where's Grover? [gentle music] ♪ ♪ Mary.

Move. No, no, no! You are not killing her. That is my sister in there. That thing? It killed my best friend. That thing is Mary Jones. She loves Harry Potter, and she's afraid of heights, and I swear to you she's still in there somewhere. Look at her. She's suffering. For all we know, she could get better, right? They-they all could get better. I'm not about to find out. Grover has a point. We know very little about this disease. If we keep this thing alive, we can learn how to defend ourselves. Don't listen to him. Just... Okay, yeah, sure, kill it. We can always find another one later. How hard can that be? You lie to us again, I'm gonna kill you both.

Um, myself. I'm starting to lose my mind. Hmm. I came in here to say thanks. You did the right thing, keeping her alive. You mean the most useful thing, and you're not here to thank me. It's amazing what you can learn with a few hours of static and nothing but student files. So I stole. Big whoop. Mm, chemicals. And not the kind you make soap and candles with. Rust and aluminum powder. For ceramics. It was a glaze. Very combustible glaze. Burns right through metal. What type of art are you doing? May I take a stab? I think you used the chemicals to make a thermite bomb. Doesn't prove anything. Not on its own. However, only a few days after you stole the chemicals, there's a catastrophic fire at the chemical plant. Quite the coincidence. And what are you suggesting? Nothing. Only that you might have been responsible for the entire disaster. Bite me. We all have our crosses to bear. Maybe one day you'll tell me yours. You didn't have to trick me. Yeah? What should I have done? You could have said, "Hey, there's a freak on the loose, and I'm doing this for your own good." Yeah, okay, like that would have worked. You're about to sleep there.

So now we have a weapon against freaks. Son of a bitch... We kept your sister alive so we could survive. Show of hands, who thinks I'm doing the right thing? Doing the right thing would have been killing her. Tie vote. Violet? What are you waiting for? Violet, she's still my sister. I mean, she's a human being.

Violet. ♪ ♪ I'm sorry, Grover. How could you side with that asshole? Barrett has a point. The more we know about how this disease works... You don't understand. My sister's in a cage. What is she, some sort of animal? Yesterday she was playing Tchaikovsky. Today she killed Noodle. You have a brother. What would you do for him? Hmm? If he was so far gone to the point I couldn't even recognize him, I don't know. [gentle music] If it were me in that cage, suffering... I know what I'd want. ♪ ♪ [snarling] ♪ ♪ I'm so sorry. ♪ ♪
