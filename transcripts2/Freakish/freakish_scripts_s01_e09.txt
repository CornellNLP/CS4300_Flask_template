 Woman : Previously on "Freakish"... 
 Who the hell are you? 
 Grover. Grover Jones. 
 Then why would you show up to Saturday detention when you don't have to? 
 The primary goal is to get to the fire station. 
 If it's still there. 
 Good luck, man. 
 Let's do it. 
 LeSean. 
 LeSean!

 ♪ ♪ John Collins, rescue and recovery. Did he just say "rescue"? He just said "rescue." ♪ ♪ Anytime you want to open the door... Oh, my God. How many are you? We're down to six. Look, man, we're all thirsty. We're out of water. Mercury, open all mains at sector 17, over. [indistinct radio chatter] Why'd they shut it off? They had no choice. They diverted every supply to fight the fires. Now, which one of you got on the radio? ♪ ♪ That was me. It was my call. What's your name? Barrett. Well, Barrett, you called in the cavalry. I need all your names. Then go get a drink. We leave in five minutes. [laughter] Water has never tasted so good. The brain from downtown, man. Smile, nerd. You did a good thing. I always knew you were trying to help us. You were one of the few who did. I was the only one. Thank you. Yeah. Yes, sir. Those are the names. Standing by. So what do they think happened at the plant? They're looking into it. I heard it was a fire in the parking lot. Not likely. Best guess is is what some kind of industrial accident. An accident? Then what's in the air? And is our basement full of mutant freaks? A number of people were infected by the toxins in the air. You still didn't answer the question. It's because I don't have an answer for you. Oh, my God. [laughter] Do you they know how many made it? Not yet. Anyone working at Keller Chemical was killed instantly. But we got lucky in places. Some of the valley was able to evacuate. Holy sh1t. Wait, so they're not all dead? Like I said, there are pockets of survivors, but time is not on our side. Do you have a list of survivors? It's chaos out there. The best we can hope for is to get you all out of here in one piece. How are we going to do that? We have a vaccine. You'll be able to breathe the air outside without getting sick. So we don't need masks? Not to get out of the blast dome. Then why were you wearing a suit? Because I've been outside in the smoke and ash for more than two days. You won't need what I've been wearing. [indistinct radio chatter] Yes, sir. Copy. Dude, why are you asking so many questions? Don't you want to know? No. He's helping us get out of here. Diesel... Listen up. There's been a delay. My men need another half hour to secure a path up here. You got that much time to get your things. But we're still going, right? [tense music] You're still going. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! [laughter] Yeah. Yeah. ♪ ♪ Hey. Is everything okay? Far from it. ♪ ♪ [eerie music] ♪ ♪ Diesel, what are you showing us? [gentle acoustic guitar music] Hey, my man. I've been saving it. I found it the props box. Oh, is it real? Hell yeah, it's real. To being almost out of here. ♪ ♪ I think that's apple juice. [laughter] What? It's apple juice. [laughter] Who built this? That'd be Barrett. Impressive. He's like Einstein. Only richer. Something you need? Did you see anyone out there? On your way here? Tall guy, green coat, gas mask? Friend of yours? He went out to look for help and his radio went silent. We haven't heard from him since. [ambient music] I've learned enough not to make promises, but I'll check for you. ♪ ♪ Thank you. ♪ ♪ [ominous music] ♪ ♪ What's the first thing you're going to do when we get out of here? Hmm. If I find my brother, we'd have a beer. I'm gonna hug my mom. Not sure what I'll say after that, but... What about you? I don't know. Probably look for Lyle's parents, I guess. ♪ ♪ Walk with me? [sighs] 20 more minutes in this place. Longest minutes of my life. [soft piano music] Hey, can I tell you something? Tell me. Woman : ♪ When I look at you ♪ You want to know what I did to get into detention? Do I? Nothing. I crashed. I came to school to be with you. ♪ ♪ Oh, no, you're weirded out, aren't you? If you hadn't done that, you could have escaped. Yeah. Or I might not be alive. Woman : ♪ I can't believe it's true ♪ Either way, I wouldn't be here right now. With you. For 20 more minutes. Woman : ♪ I can't believe it's true ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I get to love you ♪ 
♪ It's the best thing that I'll ever do ♪ 
♪ I get to love you ♪ 
♪ It's the promise I make ♪ We should get going. ♪ ♪ Wait. That's all you got? ♪ ♪ I can do better. Woman : ♪ I get to love you ♪ 
♪ I get to love you ♪ ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] Sup, beautiful? I don't want to get caught ditching. We won't. Nobody saw us. So where are we going? Anywhere. Hey, wait. Oh, my God. Stop. You guys are just the cutest couple ever, aren't you? Everybody say "threesome." What? No. No? No. ♪ ♪ 
 
 [clatter] Stealing? Can't you afford, like, 1,000 of those? A little busy. What are you doing? "Little busy" means I can't talk. [beep] Are you erasing files? Keller Chemical security? This is not for you. [beep] Oh, my God. This is not what you think. What am I supposed to think? You can't tell anyone. Natalie, please... I can make it worth your while. Are you bribing me? More like an incentive. Go to hell. I'm telling the others. Were men down that hill? 1,200 meters off. Yeah, I don't hear them. I hope not. Too much noise. It... Yeah, it brings the freaks. Then you fought 'em? Yeah, most of us have. We'll get to the perimeter this afternoon. Then the worst will be over. Excuse me, sir. I need to show you something. ♪ ♪ We should try that again sometime. Why didn't we do it sooner? [laughs] ♪ ♪ Let's go. Either of you seen Barrett? What'd he do now? ♪ ♪ The files were on this one? Yeah. ♪ ♪ Barrett? What are you doing? Hey, hey... Ugh! ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ You're trying to leave. You honestly think that man is here to save us? Yes. Why wouldn't I? Look outside. You think they made a vaccine for that overnight. It's not impossible. Then you are as gullible as the rest of them. You've lied to us at every single turn. And now Diesel tells me that you hacked the chemical plant. I am part of a group of hackers. And that's who you were talking to on the radio then, hackers. We were trying to find out if Keller Chemical... You know what I think? I think you're scared. Scared of what's going to happen to you when we get out of here? Grover, we should all be scared. ♪ ♪ Come see for yourself. It's been a long week. Yeah, it'll be over soon. I mean, not us, babe. You know, this whole cluster we're in. What's going to happen to us in the real world? Well, I'm not Mr. Perfect or anything, but we fit. What are you gonna do out there? Well, I'm not gonna move damn couches, I'll tell you that. It's hard to picture a regular day after this. Or where I'm going to be, like, five years down the road. It's not like being here, you know, now with you. Well, that's a start. Collins wants to talk. You are insane, you know that? What's insane is that all of you happily believe a man who came in here out of nowhere with no apparent backup, no credentials, and a suitcase full of shots. Which were all poison. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ The pig doesn't think so. Keep watching. ♪ ♪ We've got a bit of a situation. Barrett Mclntyre is wanted by the FBI. ♪ ♪ They consider him a flight risk. That doesn't sound possible. It does to me. Is it because of the computer files? For stealing information related to Keller Chemical. So he did have something to do with the accident. It's likely. But you don't know that for sure. ♪ ♪ Then how do you explain this? There's one missing. Holy sh1t. He's running. So what do we do? Let's go find him. No, I'll handle this. All of you stay in this room. I'll be back. ♪ ♪ This is absolutely ridiculous. You're either paranoid as hell or trying to escape. And either way, I really don't want part of it, man. [tense music] Go! Go! ♪ ♪ Ah! [gunshot whizzes] [panting] ♪ ♪ Thanks for that. It's Grover, right? Any chance you've seen Barrett? He took something of mine. I know where you can find him. Still don't see anyone. It's been, like, 20 minutes. And where the hell is Grover? Better question is where the hell is Barrett? I just can't wrap my head around it. I mean, why would he do all that? Is it really that hard to understand? He's a criminal. Probably a psychopath. He's wanted. Do you even know what it takes to get on that list? Yeah, but he got us rescued. I mean, he made the radio... Yeah, for himself. You have a blind spot for people sometimes, Zoe. But trust me, there is no good in Barrett Mclntyre. There never has been. ♪ ♪ Barrett? I'll look in the hall. ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ [grunts] Grover. Grover! How long have we been out? A couple minutes I think. What does he want from us? From me? Information. As for the rest of you... we have to get out of here. Yeah, easier said than done. [wind blowing] His men should be here by now. Their on their way. Barrett's been secured. It's time to get going. [groans] Why would you hack Keller? To expose what they were working on. You mean the chemicals. We got too close to the truth. I think they blew the place up themselves to cover their tracks. So Collins works for the plant. Yeah, best guess, he's their clean-up. The clean-up? He wants to kill us. We've seen too much. Yeah, you mean the freaks. Yeah. But he kept you alive. He wants to torture me first. And I know more than anyone. So why did he keep me alive? I have no idea. ♪ ♪ Everybody, roll up your sleeves. ♪ ♪ I should go find Grover. He's in the bathroom. He'll be back soon. So what did Barrett say when you locked him up? Nothing. I'll let the authorities work that out. So who's first? Let's do it. ♪ ♪ How about me? ♪ ♪ You ready? Ready as I'll ever be. Now... just a pinch. ♪ ♪ Okay. ♪ ♪
