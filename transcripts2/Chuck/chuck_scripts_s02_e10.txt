 BUTTE, MONTANA 1990 
 She's hurt! Someone call 911! 
 Stand back. I'm a doctor. 
 All right, sweetie. Okay. 
 She may have broken some ribs. 
 Anybody know her parents? 
 All right, I'm gonna take her to the hospital. 
 Help me get her up. 
 Ow! 
 Easy. Easy. That's it. It's okay, sweetie. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Good luck. 
 That really hurt. 
 I think I sprained my wrist. 
 Well, it's just a flesh wound, darling. 
 I can take you to the hospital, or I can get you some Rocky Road? 
 Choice is yours. 
 Rocky Road. 
 So, how much we get? 
 Want to count it? 
 Five and ten makes 20. 
 Thank you. Have a nice day. 
 Hey. 
 Long day? 
 Boring day. 
 Well, not sure if it's the excitement that you're looking for, but, uh, you want to come over tonight for a fake date with Awesome and Ellie? 
 I promise fake cuddling, but real pizza. 
 I'm sorry, Chuck. I- I have plans. 
 Oh. Is there a mission tonight? 
 I- I don't remember getting the memo. 
 Uh, no. 
 No mission. Just plans. 
 Of course. Plans. 
 Like any other single 28-year-old spy with an evening to herself would have. 
 I'm sorry, Chuck, but it's personal. 
 AUTO AUDIO INSTALL JUST ASK A NERD. 
 Hey. 
 So, uh, ready for the big mission tonight? 
 What mission? 
 You don't have to play games, okay? 
 I know. You and Sarah- super secret mission. 
 There's no mission, moron. 
 She's taking a personal day. 
 I didn't realize we got personal days. 
 Well, you don't. We do. 
 Any idea what she's up to? 
 Yep. 
 Well? 
 It's personal. 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 Giving us a little privacy so we can hook up. 
 Come here. 
 Come on. 
 Morgan! No! 
 I'm sick of hooking up only at work. 
 Ah, I'd love to go some place else, but where? 
 My mother's always home, you have three roommates. 
 I mean, I'm open to suggestions. 
 Really? Good! Here. 
 The Buena Burbank Apartments. 
 They have really cute one bedrooms. 
 See, I can't afford this. 
 We could together. We're ready to take the next step. 
 Wow. We... 
 That's, um... 
 That's a very big step, you know, and I think that it's not something that you should rush into. 
 I think that it's something you should discuss. 
 I mean, look at this place, all right? 
 72-inch plasma, super comfy couches, all the free coffee we can drink. 
 I mean, come on, baby. 
 We are living the dream. 
 Whose dream, Morgan? 
 Everyone's. 
 Hey, Chuck, you ever wonder if you're not man enough to hang onto your woman? 
 I need a Nerd Herder. 
 Uh-uh. No. Emmett found Jeff's underwear in the back seat, and he's having them all reupholstered as a safety precaution. 
 Okay, Morgan, I need to borrow your bike. 
 Sure. Yeah, sure. Why? 
 It's personal. 
 Plans, huh? 
 Honey, you look like a million dollars. 
 How old is this guy? 
 Oh. 
 FORGERY FRAUD LARCENY CHUCK Let's eat. 
 Uh, excuse me just a moment. 
 Yes, I-I'd like the linguini with the clam sauce, please. 
 How did you find me? 
 The GPS on your watch. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Look, I'm-I'm sorry. 
 I came for backup only. 
 I told you, it was personal. 
 I know. I know, but I flashed. 
 Look, I'm all... I'm all for a little time off, and God knows, you deserve it, but I think that you should know that the much, much, much older gentleman that you're having dinner with right now is a very bad man, Sarah. 
 Chuck... 
 Let me finish. 
 The guy is a total loser, all right? 
 Absolute bottom-feeding, scum of the earth, have I mentioned, considerably older man? 
 All true, but I'm a hell of a dancer. 
 Chuck, I'd like you to meet my dad, Jack Burton. 
 Dad, this is my boyfriend, Chuck. 
 A real pleasure, sir. 
 French toast, whipped cream, fresh strawberries. 
 Just how you like them. 
 When I was 12. 
 Well, you need to eat something. 
 Big day at work. 
 What is it you're doing again? 
 Making milkshakes? 
 Frozen yogurt. 
 Oh. Sounds stimulating. 
 Pays the bills. 
 Well, yeah, I can see that. 
 Very believable. 
 And what is that supposed to mean? 
 This place. Your job. Your name. 
 Sarah Walker? 
 That schnook from last night. Chippy? 
 Chuck. 
 You're working an angle. 
 I mean, he's probably the son of some, uh, rich Beverly Hills family? 
 Look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour, so you stay away from him. 
 Hey, you don't want to cut me in, fine. 
 I don't need his money. 
 I got my own. 
 Oh, my God. 
 That looks like almost a million dollars. 
 Well, Christmas came a little early. 
 For you. 
 No, thanks. 
 I'm not interested in your stolen money. 
 Stolen? That's what you think of your old man, some two-bit thief? 
 Darling, a thief has to run out of town as fast as he can, but a good con man... 
 A good con man can leave whenever he wants. 
 I remember, Dad. 
 So, who donated the money anyway? 
 A couple months ago, I flew over to Dubai. 
 You wouldn't believe the kind of money they got floating over there. Oh! 
 This particular donation is compliments of Sheik Rajiv Amad. 
 Amad? The Saudi oil family? 
 My daughter knows her Arabs. 
 I got to go to work. 
 Um... forgetting something? 
 Have fun at the office. 
 General, In the spirit of full disclosure,  my father has conned Sheik Rajiv Amad out of nearly a million dollars. 
 Hit the big time. 
 Give the order, and I'll bring him in. 
 What? ! You're gonna arrest your own father? 
 Isn't that kind of a conflict of interest? 
 If Agent Walker's uncomfortable, I'd be happy to make the arrest. 
 No one is getting arrested. Yet. 
 Amad's been on the CIA's terror watch list for years. 
 He's suspected of funding terrorist regimes in Afghanistan and Kenya. 
 We have no recent photos, and he goes by a number of different aliases. 
 Any information your father could provide about the sheik's financial holdings would be valuable intel. 
 General, my father is unaware of my CIA career. 
 In fact, I'm not sure he would be all that proud. 
 No one is asking you to compromise your cover, Agent Walker. 
 Just talk to your father. 
 Take the Intersect with you. 
 General, my father... 
 Your father conned a very connected, very dangerous man. 
 You better find out how deep he's in before the sheik does. 
 Captain Morgan. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 Uh, have you seen Chuck? 
 Left for work. What's up? 
 What's up? 
 Basically, my life is over, that's what up. 
 You ready for this? 
 Anna asked me to get an apartment together. 
 Whoa! 
 Big step, little man. All right. 
 I don't know about all right. 
 I- I... You know what, man? 
 I just don't think I'm ready for that. 
 Things are good with us. 
 You know, why-why rock the boat? 
 Permission to speak freely? 
 There are no secrets between us. 
 Would you agree that you have no credit, no life plan, no apartment, no car, no adult responsibilities of any kind? 
 On rare occasion, I do my own laundry. 
 Time to grow up, Morgan. 
 I know. Here's the thing. 
 This apartment- it's a lot of dough. 
 It'll clear me out. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're a little short on cash, you know, we'll lend it to you. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Wait a minute. 
 You'd do that for me? Really? 
 Yeah. 
 That's-That's super cool, man. 
 Why? 
 Because I believe in you. 
 Consider it an investment in your future. 
 Whoa. Are you... Are you sure about that? 
 Yes, I'm sure. 
 Besides, you'll pay me back. 
 12% interest every week, or it goes up two points. 
 Absolutely. What does that mean? 
 $2, 500 should cover it. 
 There you go, Morgan. 
 Welcome to adulthood. 
 We've been waiting for you. 
 Sarah was just bluffing with Beckman, right? 
 I mean, she'd never arrest her own father. 
 Why not? Guy's a criminal. 
 Been in and out of jail her whole life. 
 But he... but he seems to care, though. 
 You know, I mean, at least he's attempting to have a relationship. 
 I don't even know where my own father is. 
 Oh, that's sad. 
 You've confused me with someone that cares about your life before the Intersect. 
 Good session, buddy. 
 Really feel like we had a breakthrough there. 
 So long, Chuck. 
 We had a good run, didn't we? 
 Stuff of legend. Where you headed? 
 Adulthood. 
 Anna and I are moving in together. 
 Really? That's fantastic! Congratulations, buddy. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I guess. 
 Enjoy your youth, Charles. 
 Enjoy every damn minute of it. 
 Dude, have you seen her? ! 
 Who? 
 Just the hottest piece ever to come into this store! 
 Not even human. 
 Smoking hot. 
 Where? 
 Follow your boys. 
 1981 DeLorean DMC. 
 Only 9, 000 made. 
 The exact car from Back to the Future. 
 Actually,  the Back to the Future car had a Porsche engine. 
 When's it going to be done? 
 Few weeks. 
 Months, at least. 
 Well, hopefully the iPod adapter will help me sell it. 
 Are you serious? 
 How could you have any trouble selling this treasure? 
 The passenger door doesn't work, the gas mileage is horrible, and if it actually goes over 22 miles per hour, it stalls. 
 REALLY? 
 I'll take it. 
 Deal. 
 Yes! 
 Good boy. 
 He's not a schnook! 
 He's a wonderful caring, intelligent guy. 
 Who's a class A schnook. 
 Look, you don't want to cut me in, no problem. 
 But don't play me for a fool. 
 The guy has 2, 200 bucks to his name. 
 How do you know? 
 I lifted his ATM card last night. 
 I wanted to check him out 'cause I was worried about you. 
 And now that you know he's broke? 
 Now, I'm really worried. 
 I'm going to get a cab. 
 Charlie, there you are. 
 Hi. 
 Good to see you again, Mr. Burton. 
 Oh, please, please, Jack. 
 Nice tie. 
 Looking sharp, young man. 
 Well, I think he's warming up to me. 
 This accidentally fell into my father's pocket. 
 It's okay. 
 He's just being protective of you. 
 And after the way I behaved last night, I can't say that I blame him. 
 Chuck, you're attributing good intentions to him because you're a good person. 
 Well, he must have done something right. 
 You turned out pretty good. 
 Let's go. 
 The trick wasit had to be an actual accident. 
 Angel here was the best. 
 She could make a real doc believe that she had a broken arm. 
 Uh, that's because I did. 
 One time- that's only because the armored truck hit a patch of ice. 
 Unforeseeable act of God, honey. 
 At least your childhood was filled with excitement. 
 No kid had as much fun as you did. 
 Um, so this latest, uh, score? 
 Sarah said you were just in Dubai? 
 Sure it's okay? 
 Oh, he's fine. Trust me. 
 Always, darling. 
 Never forget that. 
 Something about, uh, a rich sheik? 
 I'm not a boastful man, Charlie,  but this was my Mona Lisa. 
 These oil guys were just dying to buy anything American. 
 Oh, no. You didn't. 
 Oh, yeah. Of course I did. 
 I think I'm missing a step here. 
 He pulled a Lichtenstein. 
 A Lichten what? 
 Lichtenstein is a crazy invention of my father's. 
 A German billionaire who has fallen on hard times, and needs to sell something fast. 
 So, like, a piece of art, or jewelry? 
 Bigger. 
 A boat? A plane? 
 Closer, Charlie. 
 But I brought you to my hotel for a reason. 
 I sold them that. 
 You... 
 What? ! You sold them Nagamichi Plaza? That's incredible. 
 That's dangerous. 
 They're going to find you. 
 Oh, relax. 
 The 700 grand is a finder's fee for putting them in touch with Lichtenstein. 
 By the time they know it's gone, I'll be on an island. 
 Remember, Charlie, the bigger the lie, the easier... 
 The easier it is to believe. 
 Very good. 
 You think your dad bought us as a couple? 
 He's a pretty sharp guy. 
 He has his moments. 
 Maybe we should amp up the PDA. 
 Try and sell it a little better. 
 Very funny. 
 Just make sure you have your wallet. 
 Oh! 
 I just flashed. That's him. 
 That's Sheik Rajiv Amad. 
 Stay here. 
 What do you think he wants? 
 What do you think? 
 Lichtenstein. 
 Too bad he doesn't exist. 
 This, uh, this has all  been a terrible misunderstanding. 
 Why don't we meet in the morning in Mr. Lichtenstein's office and we can settle this whole mess. 
 You must think I'm a fool, Mr. Burton. 
 I want my money. 
 Well, you want your money back, that's fine, but I have to warn you then the deal is off. 
 In fact, uh, this is Mr. Lichtenstein's personal secretary right here. 
 Ms. Applebaum? 
 May I present Sheik Rajiv Amad. 
 It's a pleasure to meet you. 
 Mr. Lichtenstein has been expecting you. 
 How's tomorrow at 2:00? 
 I have a better idea. 
 Why don't we go get him right now? 
 I thought so. 
 There's no Lichtenstein. 
 Mr. Lichtenstein? ! 
 Is there a Mr. Lichtenstein here? 
 Ja. 
 Uh, Mr. Lichtenstein, you have a message. 
 Uh, Sheik Rajiv Amad, may I present Hans Lichtenstein. 
 Unfortunately, Mr. Lichtenstein only speaks German. 
 But he'll be happy to meet you tomorrow at his office. 
 2:00? 
 Okay. 
 But if I don't get my building, he's a dead man. 
 Translate that. 
 Okay. 
 I knew you two were on the grift. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Hey, honey, why is there $2, 500 missing from our account? 
 I forgot to tell you, I lent it to Morgan. 
 I can only assume that you met some other Morgan at work, because the thought of you giving away a hunk of our nest egg is just too horrific to consider. 
 I didn't give it away. 
 I lent it to him so he can get an apartment with Anna. 
 Uh, Chuck, how much does Morgan make at the Buy More? 
 Uh, about 12 bucks an hour. 
 Not including his always appreciating comic book collection which I would value in the $500 area. 
 Devon... 
 It was an investment in his future. 
 You know, so he could become an adult. 
 That would probably be Morgan. 
 He's giving me a ride to work. 
 On what, his handlebars? 
 No, uh, uh, Morgan, Morgan bought a barely functioning '81 DeLorean that... only goes 22 miles an hour, so I better get going. 
 See ya. 
 You don't have to say it, babe. 
 I'll get our money back. 
 
 
 
 General, I'd like to apologize  for last night. 
 Chuck never should have gotten caught up in my father's ridiculous con. 
 I recommend we place the Intersect in protective lockdown till we're sure the sheik is out of the country. 
 And waste the perfect setup? 
 I'm not sure I follow. 
 The CIA has been trying to locate the hidden bank accounts of the Amad family for years. 
 If you can convince him to wire you the funds, we can access those accounts and freeze them. 
 Uh, funds for what? 
 The building. 
 It will need to be at least $10 million to access his international accounts. 
 General, is the agency asking us to commit fraud? 
 No, that would mean the CIA has some knowledge of your mission. 
 How are we supposed to sell a 60-story building in one day? 
 Ask your father. 
 He seems to be very proficient in his chosen profession. 
 Wait, this is the sound coming from here. 
 Oh, that's... 
 Yeah, you thought that the... 
 No. 
 Do you know where Morgan is? 
 Who's to say? If he was able to get a hold of some high-grade plutonium, he could be anywhere. 
 Any place. 
 Any time. 
 The Old West perhaps? 
 If I could travel in time, I'd go to Lester's birth. 
 I'd love to see the look on your face when you emerged from the vaginal canal. 
 Morgan went to the DMV to get plates for the DeLorean. 
 I lent him that money to get an apartment, not blow it on some stupid car. 
 What? ! 
 That money was for our apartment? ! 
 I'm gonna kill him. 
 Get in line, Anna. 
 All right, here's the thing. 
 I beg both of you to reserve judgment until you've seen the plate. 
 'Cause you are gonna be. . 
 Oh. Yeah. 
 I nailed it, right? 
 You have exactly one day to get my money back to me or I pluck you from head to toe. 
 Start with the groin. 
 He won't be using that region for a while. 
 But, honey... I got it for us. 
 There is no reason to walk away now. 
 You know, I think we could get the sheik to pay a three percent deposit. 
 Market value is over $300 million... 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's a lot of dough. 
 Remember darling, pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. 
 Well, the bigger the lie, the easier it is to believe. 
 We can do this. 
 I guess, uh, 5 mill each ain't too bad. 
 Two point five. 
 You want my help, you have to use my team. 
 What team? 
 Mmm. 
 He's got a cop face. 
 No offense. 
 Look, either he's in, or none of us are. 
 Fine. But he's your problem. 
 All right, Sarah and I will handle the deal. 
 Cop Face, you're security. 
 We can switch names if you'd like. 
 I can be Cop Face and you can be Schnook. 
 We'll use our account number for the wire transfer. 
 Don't trust you. 
 No offense. 
 Uh, question- what about me? 
 I mean, I'm familiar with Hogan's Heroes and Castle Wolfenstein,   but beyond that my German is a little rusty. 
 Schnook, your job is going to be toughest of all. 
 You need to sit there and not say a word. 
 All right, everybody gather around. 
 First, we need  to evacuate the current building management. NAGAMICHI BUILDING 51ST FLOOR 
 Can I have your attention please? 
 We need everyone out of this office immediately. 
 This floor is being fumigated. 
 We have already released toxic fumes. 
 That can lead to infertility and low sperm count. 
 All right, you heard them. 
 Everyone out. 
 Let's go, people. 
 Quickly. Quickly. 
 Next, we need to redecorate Lichtenstein Enterprises. 
 Cop Face, you're going to use the gifts God gave you- LOBBY your cop face. They're here. Showtime. Most importantly, we need to convince him that we don't want to sell the building. He's the one getting the deal, not us. I'm sorry, Mr. Lichtenstein will be in Prague on Friday. No, Monday he's in Moscow. Wendy, I don't want to be interrupted. I don't care if Mr. Trump calls. Tell him the building is no longer for sale. I'll see him next week in New York. Gentlemen, welcome. We'll have to call you back next week. Bye-bye. Mr. Lichtenstein will see you now. Gentlemen, may I present to you Mr. Hans Lichtenstein. Well, I'm sure you're very busy, so we'll make this as painless as possible- after your lawyers examine the contracts and the inspections are done, we can have a more formal meeting. For now, we only require a three percent deposit to take the property off the market. And that would be... $10 million. First, I would like to have a word with Mr. Lichtenstein. Of course. I'll translate. Herr Amad m. chte ein Wort mit Ihnen. Mr. Amad would like a word with you. I'm sorry. I don't trust you. I brought my own translator. Hallo, Herr Lichtenstein. hello, Mr. Lichtenstein. Irgendetwas, das Sie sagen m. gen, anything you wish to say... sagen Sie durch mich. ... you say through me. That is the worst German accent I have ever heard. You... you butcher my language. The deal is off. Sounds like Colonel Klink. So, as far as you know, no one ordered an exterminator today? I'm on my way now to find out what the hell is going on. We got company. Time to wrap it up. I'm sorry, Mr. Amad. It looks like the deal is off, but if I could have your account number, I'd be happy to wire you the $700, 000 that you gave to Mr. Burton. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Now, there's no reason to panic. Everyone, calm down. We can work this out. Nein, nein! Out of my building. The deal is off. Mr. Lichtenstein has been offended. Everyone out of the building. There's no reason to panic. Uh, we're all businessmen here. Let's just sit down and finish... Enough! You're all crazy. No more games. This is my building. We had a deal. Uh, well, Sheik, would you care to, uh, type in your account number for security purposes? Uh, just go ahead and do the typey type. Feel free to look over the space. We'll, uh, give you a moment. Never do business with Germans. Who the hell are you? And how did you get up here? Why does that wall say Lichtenstein? To Lichtenstein. Well, you pulled it off, kid. You made me a believer. Well, my German is a little rusty, but... No, no, that you two are a couple. For later, Cop Face. Oh, victory smoke. Thanks. You did good, baby. So did you. I'm gonna get some ice. Well, I'm not one to say I told you so, but I think that worked out pretty good, now, didn't it? I guess he pulled through for me... this one time. Uh-huh. Yes, General? Mission accomplished. The money was transferred to the CIA account about an hour ago. Beckman never got the money. The laptop is gone. So is my cigar. Hey. They were all out of fruit, so I was forced to bring up a couple chocolate croissants. Oh, I guess I have no choice but to take those off you. Come in. You okay? I'm fine. My dad will turn up somewhere, but, uh, I guess the real crime is that we didn't get to freeze the sheik's accounts. Well, I'm sorry if I pushed you into trusting your father. If there's one thing I learned from my father, it's be ready for disappointment. And if it's anyone's fault, it's mine. No, it's not. 11 years ago, my father left Ellie and me. He's a... he was an unusual man. I guess that's generous. An engineer. We used to get Christmas cards and birthday calls, and then one year it just... it just stopped. I don't know why. What I do know is that it wasn't my fault. Granted, it took a significant amount of time and... an incredible amount of therapy to come to that realization, but... you need to know that your father's sins are his and not yours. That's pretty eloquent for 9:00 a. m. What can I say? I am an articulate schnook. Lucky for me. You're alone? Yes, General. We've tracked down Jack Burton. He checked into a downtown motel under the alias, Guido Merkins. Well, I understand the sensitivity of the situation. I'll go alone. Agent Casey? Yeah? Tell Agent Walker I'm sorry. Roger that. Where am I going to find $2, 500? Charles. Hey, my man. Looking well as usual. Oh, my, and that... that scent. It's like the beach after the rains. What do you call it? Deodorant. What do you want? I, uh... I need to borrow some money or your future brother-in-I's gonna... pluck me from head to toe. How much we talking? Um, not too much. $2, 500? Give or take. You did good, babe. No kid had as much fun as you did. UNKNOWN CALLER What? Baby, I'm sorry, but I got a perfect excuse for what happened. Well, I'd love to hear all about it. Some other time. Just remember, I did it all for you. So touching. Oh, so touching- family reunion. Now, where the hell is my money? I don't have it. Well, then, we have a real problem. Don't give it to him, honey. If anything happens to my father... What, you will con me out of more money? No... I'll kill you. Then, bring me what is mine, and we won't have a problem. Okay? I'll call you in an hour. TRANSMISSION LOST Thank you so much for this. Oh, yeah. Do you mind? Oh, I can't know your PIN? I'll give you mine if it makes you feel better. There are some boundaries, Morgan. Okay. All right, all right, I'm sorry. Oh, my God. "Oh, my God, " what? Oh, you're broke, right? It's okay. Don't feel bad, dude. You know what? There are places I could use some grooming, SO, FORGET ABOUT IT. ALANCE INQUIRY CHECKING ACCOUNT ACCOUNT BALANCE Hey, hey, Sarah. Look, I hope this isn't a mistake and the CIA has decided to compensate me for my numerous acts of heroism... Later, Chuck. but there happens to be an extra- oh, I don't know- $10 million in my ATM account. What? Why would my father put the sheik's money in your account? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Again, we're not so sure that this is coming from your father. I'm still clinging to the compensation theory. Leave it there. You know, that's not a bad idea. It should earn a couple thousand a day in interest. What are you doing? Where are you going? It's personal. Hey, hey. You seen Walker? Yeah, she just left in a real big hurry with two duffel bags stuffed full of T-shirts and some serious firepower. Where are you going? It's personal. Morgan. Morgan. Yeah, buddy. Morgan, I'm gonna loan you the money. Oh, thank you. First, I need to borrow the De-Morgan. It's an emergency. Oh, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yours, done. What's up? It's personal. Treat her well, my friend. That's close enough. You have something for me? Where's my father? Hey. Yeah. Nothing. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I have your money right here. Hey, no! Grab her gun! Mr. Lichtenstein, thank you for joining. Here to sell me the DeLorean? I have your money, okay? And I can wire it to you right now. If you're lying, I will put a bullet in her head. All I need is your account number. Please. We're just a couple of bad con men who got in way too deep. All right? All we want to do is give you your money back. Come take it and let us go. ACTIVE ACCOUNT ENTER ACCOUNT# The sheik's account number. Hmm. Decent plan, Bartowski. Of course I'll never tell him that. There. You have your money. Pleasure doing business. Now kill them. What? OKAY. Hold it right there! U. S. Treasury. Don't anybody move. Send 'em up, boys. I got him. I got Lichtenstein. Come on. Oh! Yeah. Yeah, you're really... You're really selling it there, Casey. Yeah. Is this a joke? Huh? Where's your backup? Oh. I'm just the tip of the spear. Rest of the crew's on their way up. I've been following these grifters for months now. You know, if you gentlemen would be willing to testify, I'm sure we can get the weapons charges dropped, hmm? Drop it! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You lower your weapon, or I will kill your father. If I did that to him, imagine what I'll do to you. Drop your weapon! Oh! Amad's getting away. Not at 22 miles an hour he's not. All clear. Dad. Hey. Yeah, thanks. Little rough with the cuffs, though. Yeah. Call it in. You didn't use blanks? What's wrong with you people? It's just a flesh wound. Yeah. Hi. I'd like to report a stolen '81 DeLorean. License plate is D- E-M-O-R-G-A-N. ♪♪♪ Thanks to your efforts, we were able to freeze nearly a billion dollars of the sheik's foreign accounts. Well done. General. Hmm. Now, to the unpleasant news. Agent Walker, we're sending a unit to your hotel to pick up your father for the previous embezzlement charge at 5:00 today. Say your good-byes. That's all. General? As you know, Mr. Burton was invaluable in the seizure of these funds. Perhaps that could lessen his prison sentence. Prosecution will be made aware of that. Thank you. You're not going to believe this. The police just called. The DeLorean was stolen. Morgan, I've been meaning to tell you... Dude, do you know what that means? They have to impound the car. I'm gonna get Blue Book value. I'll pay back Awesome, and I'll still have ten large! Dude, I'm rich! Aah! We're rich. Now, we can move in together in style. I am doing the whole living room in shabby chic. Love you. Love you. Oh. Kiss. Kiss. Oh. Mmm. Yummy kisses. Well, you have to grow up sometime, you know? The right girl, the right time. I'm proud of you, buddy. Thank you. Dude, you're not gonna believe what just showed up in the Audio Install. Morgan, no! Yes. No. Yes. DO NOT. Well, it couldn't hurt to look, you know... FOR SALE FOR SALE Aah! Ooh! Boy, lucky you're a good shot. But a good con man doesn't need a gun, and he can leave... Leave town whenever he wants. I know. Uh, Dad, can you get me some Rocky Road? There's a store around the corner. Sure thing, darling. Why did you put the money in Chuck's account? I needed to put it somewhere 'cause I didn't trust Cop Face. But you trusted Chuck? I read people. That's the only real talent I got. One thing I know- that kid would never betray you. I made a $10 million bet that he loved you. Turns out I was right. I'll be back in a minute. Uh, Dad? Can you make it a double scoop? Sure, darling. Hello, Charlie. I've kind of grown accustomed to Schnook. So have I. I, uh... I wanted to thank you for coming back when I gave you ten million reasons to leave. But one really good reason to stay. And she would have done the same for me. Yeah, I believe she would have. Lucky for me, she met the right schnook. He went over there... My daughter is some kind of cop, isn't she? Yeah. Yeah. Something like that. She turned out pretty good. Even with a lousy father. Take care of her. I'll do my best. You okay? I'm fine. Here. He'll be back soon. No, he won't.
