 TOP SECRET LOCATION, 1994 
 I yield, sensei. 
 You are unfocused, again. 
 I yield. 
 Too slow. 
 Again! 
 Your center is filled with conflict, John. 
 Until you find your calm center, you will never beat me. 
 You can't beat a winning smile, John. 
 Not in retail sales. 
 You need to show your customers those pearly whites. 
 Well, soon-to-be pearly whites. You need to bleach them. 
 Just show them you got a pulse, Casey. 
 Give 'em a "Hey, how ya doin? " 
 Or a "Put 'em there, partner. " 
 Or "You bet!" 
 Walk on back to the back... 
 You bet. 
 Thanks for the tips, Emmett. 
 Yup. John Casey scares me. 
 Well, that's what happens when you bottle up your feelings like that. 
 You wake up one day and you're a seething mass of pain. 
 Right. Hey, what's going on with you and Jill? 
 Ah, yeah. My, my pain. 
 Let's talk about that. 
 Where is she? 
 Big house. 
 Bought a big house. 
 Bought a real big house up the river. 
 Oh, that sounds really pretty. 
 You guys are, uh, "done" done, right? 
 Yeah, I mean, I just figured out hanging out with Jill was more about closing a door than opening one. 
 I get it. I get it. 
 Listen, the old flame can burn, right? But I bet you, it made you even more sure who the right girl is for you. 
 Ah, speak of the smoking hot angel. 
 I'll get out of here. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Sarah. 
 Chuck, does the Global Launch Agency mean anything to you? 
 GLA? Sure, they've sent probes to every planet except Pluto. 
 Although, Pluto's not officially a planet anymore, which really bums me out. 
 That's true. 
 Space camp is where all the cool kids go. 
 GLA also conducts top secret research for the NSA. 
 Most of our surveillance and weapons tracking technology is developed there. 
 We picked up intel that someone might try to penetrate one of the lab's secure facilities. 
 I want you and the Intersect to surveil the facility. 
 See if there's anyone inside who you flash on. 
 Another mission already? 
 Is there a problem, Mr. Bartowski? 
 No, no. 
 No, I was just, you know, I was kind of hoping for some downtime. 
 We'll take it from here, ma'am. 
 Aw, you need a little break, Bartowski? 
 Yeah, that'd be nice. 
 I mean, finding out Jill was Fulcrum was a bit of a shock to the system, you know? 
 I guess I wouldn't mind some time to sort out my feelings. 
 Sure thing, Chuck. 
 I'll just call all the criminals and rogue spies and let them know to hold on a sec, 'cause Chuck Bartowski needs some time to sort out his lady feelings. 
 Ease up, Casey. 
 Look, Chuck, we know how hard this has been for you, but maybe a new mission is exactly what you need right now. 
 Great, new mission in the surveillance van. 
 Very exciting. 
 You're on an open mic, Chuck. 
 Am I? That's, that's good to know. 
 Thanks for telling me that. 
 Uh, I have all the entrances and exits covered. 
 It looks pretty quiet. 
 You're not seeing anything? 
 Nothing. No flashes, nothing. 
 I'm all clear here. 
 All clear. 
 Security's tight. 
 Close the west lab door, Chuck! 
 I'm in! I'm in! I'm in, it's just going to take a second. 
 Do it! Do it! 
 Almost got it. Almost got it. Almost there. 
 Now, Chuck. Close it. 
 Lock it down! 
 You know, I don't know one person who responds positively to being yelled at! 
 He's getting away, Chuck. 
 Door closed. Got it. There. See? 
 You idiot! 
 You said you knew how to work this system. 
 Ooh, hang in there. 
 Come on, Chuck! 
 Almost got it. Almost got it. 
 Got it. 
 No problem. 
 Ye of little faith. 
 Sensei? 
 GO! 
 NSA TACTICAL INSTRUCTOR TY BENNETT Oh, no. 
 Hey, did you get a good look at him? 
 Didn't have to. I know him. 
 What? 
 Guys! Hey! I just flashed on that dude. 
 And it is crazy, it's actually kind of a small world, funny story. 
 Save it. 
 His name's Ty Bennett. 
 He was my sensei. 
 Taught me everything I know. 
 You okay? 
 Hmm. BUY MORE Feeling better now. 
 Chuck! Chuck! You've got to help me! This is an emergency! 
 Chuck! 
 What? What? What? 
 Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Are you okay!? 
 No! No! 
 Devon's parents decided to take the red-eye in from Connecticut to surprise us! 
 You scared the heck out of me. 
 I thought this was life or death. 
 It is! These are two perfect parents that raised three perfect boys in a perfect house, and this place is a pigsty. 
 Don't worry. 
 We have time to clean up. If they flew all night, they're going to want to sleep all morning. 
 Are you kidding me? The awesome apple doesn't fall far from the awesome tree. 
 I'm just going to... I'll be right there. 
 Awesome! There's the man! 
 Wow! Welcome! Hi. You guys are very muscular. 
 And... and awake! 
 Chuck, this is Devon's mom and dad. 
 Drs. Woodcomb, so nice to finally meet you. 
 Oh, no handshakes in this family. 
 You just call me Honey. 
 Okay, Honey. 
 I'm Woody. 
 Hey, Woody. 
 Yeah. My father always said, "A terrible nickname builds character. " 
 Of course, Devon wasn't into nicknames. 
 I just can't wait to start planning your dream wedding. 
 Wow! It looks like you already have. 
 Oh, and, Chuck, the caterer is bringing over a sample menu tonight for Devon and Ellie to decide what they like. We hope you and your... girlfriend can join us. 
 Yes! Of course! Of course! 
 Sarah loves food. 
 That she does! 
 So, yeah, we'll be there! 
 Good. Good. 
 So nice of you guys to help us plan the wedding. Right, Ell? 
 Oh, absolutely! 
 Your mom's already been busy with all these lists of guests, locations, color palettes... 
 She's been so excited ever since Devon asked you to marry him. 
 I can't tell you how happy we are to welcome you into our family. 
 And now, you're stuck with us, too, Chuck. 
 You're very strong, and have fists. 
 Thank you, Dr. Woodcomb. 
 "Woody. " 
 Okay. 
 Dad, let's go do our abs. 
 Ooh, yeah. 
 You guys do abs. 
 I'm... I'm just going to go... kill myself. 
 Ty Bennett : Karate master, kung fu expert, master strategist. 
 A former instructor at our training facility. And, today, one of our most wanted rogue agents. 
 Dude, your sensei is a badass! 
 He's not my sensei. He's a traitor. 
 Wow. I've heard of Bennett, but I've never met anyone who actually trained with him. 
 I can't talk about it. It's classified. 
 We're opening Bennett's file for this assignment. 
 Any personal knowledge you have could be vital to the success of this mission. 
 Come on, Casey. Share with us. 
 In hell. 
 General, if I may, why wasn't I told that Bennett went rogue? 
 Ty Bennett has been recruiting his former students. 
 He's actually turning agents? 
 With the team he's assembled, Bennett has been extremely effective at stealing weapons and reselling them on the global black market. 
 What did he steal from GLA? 
 An advanced inertial guidance system. 
 Well, that's not a weapon. 
 Well, fit sure looks like one when it's put in a missile, moron. 
 You know, when you call me moron, that hurts me on the inside. 
 Bennett got away because you couldn't open a door. 
 You're lucky your feelings aren't the only thing that got hurt. 
 Technically, I only have to sit in the van and flash. 
 Hey. 
 Guys. 
 Gentlemen, we have intel pinpointing the location where Bennett plans to transfer the GLA technology to his buyer. 
 It's a construction site in Simi Valley. 
 I want you to stop the deal and recover the guidance system. 
 We're on it. 
 You know, I wonder if it's safe for Chuck to go on this mission. 
 Too many unforeseeable variables. 
 In situations like this, he has proven himself a liability. 
 I think you're right, Casey. 
 Chuck, you will be sitting this one out. 
 What? Wait a minute. 
 You might... you might need me to flash on something. 
 Oh, this country has gotten by for 200 years without an Intersect. 
 I'm sure we'll be just fine. 
 What? Did I hurt your feelings? 
 I've tried to spare your feelings,   but the gloves are coming off, people. 
 I've decided to reinstitute a time-honored Buy More tradition. 
 Commando Wednesdays. 
 That tradition never stopped. 
 From this day on, this branch will hold- wait for it- an Employee of the Month contest. 
 Oh! Isn't that exciting? 
 I can barely contain myself, sir. 
 I assume you're all aware of our customer comment cards. 
 Each month, we will tally your score and select a winner. 
 He or she or whomever will not only get an 8 X 10 glossy photo right beside Moses Finkelstein, EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH YOUR NAME HERE the CEO and founder of Buy More, but there will be a bonus prize! 
 May the best employee win. 
 Okay, so how are feeling about this about this whole Employee-of-the-Month thing? 
 Um, you know what? Whatever, Morgan. 
 I don't, I don't really care. 
 We don't care. Roger that. 
 Hey. 
 I thought you guys would already be gone. 
 Admit it. You need me, don't ya? 
 I came to make sure you're okay. 
 Well, isn't that what all the surveillance cameras are for? 
 Listen, I don't agree with Casey that you would be a liability on this mission. 
 He was out of line. 
 Don't worry. I get it. 
 He thinks I let my feelings for Jill get in the way of the mission. 
 But he's wrong. I would never do that... again. 
 Listen, Chuck, this isn't about you, it's Casey. 
 Casey trained with Bennett for a long time, and when you have a mentor like that, a real trust develops between you, and Casey feels betrayed. 
 I know it's hard, but maybe you could cut him some slack. 
 Yeah, I guess I know how that feels. 
 THROUGH THESE HALLS WALK THE SMARTEST EMPLOYEES IN THE WORLD SALES TEAM All right, just to be absolutely clear, our position on Employee of the Month is that we don't care, Are you guys with me? 
 Yep, not caring. 
 Not a rat's ass. 
 Not a fat and/or hairy one. 
 Wait. Why don't we care again? 
 Because Employee of the Month is a scam. 
 And working hard is for suckers. 
 Think about it. 
 You work hard, sales go up. 
 Sales go up, shareholders get rich. 
 Shareholders get rich, and we get what exactly? 
 He said something about a prize. 
 Your face on a wall next to Moses Finkelstein? 
 No, thank you, no. 
 You know what? Keep your stupid stooge prize. 
 So we get nothing? 
 Emmett's gonna get all the credit. 
 He may even get a promotion. 
 And then guess what? 
 One day, he's gonna be the boss. 
 So then what? 
 Then Emmett turns the Buy More into a nightmare of pain and suffering? 
 There is a solution. 
 Tell it, tell it. 
 We have our own contest, a side bet. 
 We see who can get the lowest score  on their comment cards. 
 We beat Emmett at his own game. 
 Pure genius. 
 From now on, the customers can go service themselves. 
 In the retail sense, Jeffrey. 
 Don't get any ideas. 
 Bennett will never show. 
 Why? 
 He's too smart for this. 
 You get a read on the plates? 
 Look, Casey, just call Chuck. Maybe he'll flash on it and we'll know who we're dealing with. 
 I think I'll take my chances without him. 
 Oh, all right. 
 Fine. 
 Hello? 
 Hey, we just sent you an image of a van. 
 Take a look at the plates, see if you flash on it. 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course. 
 Absolutely. Whatever I can do to help. 
 You know, I don't have it yet. 
 It's probably a high-resolution photo. 
 And my 3G connection gets interference in here sometimes. 
 Spare me the Nerd Herd crap. Get on it. 
 If there's intel, we need it now! 
 Hey, I thought you said the U. S. government got by just fine for 200 years without the Intersect? 
 Listen, you insignificant little puke... 
 You're on a mission. 
 Maybe surrounded by Bennett's men. 
 Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. 
 Did you hang up on me? 
 No, that's crazy talk. I would never do that. 
 It's a bad connection that I had with the... 
 Hold on. Let me just look at the picture real quick. 
 I got nothing. Sorry, no flash. 
 Thanks for wasting my time. 
 Hello? 
 Hey, that's the buyer. 
 We're out of time. 
 Looks like we do this the old-fashioned way. 
 Okay? Go. 
 Yeah. 
 Get out of the car! Out of the car! 
 Take the car, man, and I won't call the cops. 
 Hands on the car! Put 'em on the car! 
 Who the hell are you? 
 I'm a driver. I'm here to pick up a passenger and give them that. 
 Bennett. Run! Go! Go! 
 Excuse me. Can you tell me where I can find John Casey? 
 I have something that belongs to him. 
 ... Casey, you say? John Casey? 
 You know, I'm gonna go to the back and-and-and check on that for you. 
 So let me just... do that... quick. 
 Pick up the phone, John. Pick up the phone, Casey! 
 This is Casey. 
 Code Red! Code Red! Redder than red! 
 It is the reddest! It is the reddest of all hues! 
 We are Defcon One, or Five or whichever means "Hurry, " right now! 
 Bennett is at the Buy More! 
 Oh, no. 
 I'm looking for John Casey. 
 Can you tell me where to find him? 
 What do I look like, an information desk? 
 Excuse me? 
 Yes, fine, you're excused. 
 Oh, and don't forget to fill out a customer comment card on your way out. 
 Wise man always treats a stranger with respect, for he could be gazing on the face of an enemy. 
 Hi. Sorry, sorry. 
 I just checked into it, sir, and John Casey is unfortunately not working today, and I don't know when he's gonna be back in, but you could try back next week. 
 Uh, maybe, maybe Tuesday-ish. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 That guy was awesome! 
 Dude, did you see what he did to this can? 
 He did this with his bare hands. 
 Crush, like that. Could you imagine what he could do to a guy's face? 
 Not feeling very chatty right now. 
 Hold on, Casey, don't hang up. 
 I'm looking right at your sensei. 
 Bennett's at the Buy More? 
 What? How is that possible? 
 Was. Was at the Buy More. 
 Now he's in the Large Mart parking garage. I'm tailing him. 
 No, stop, imbecile! You're no match for him. 
 Don't be an idiot! 
 Look, you're only reacting like this because your own feelings were hurt, okay? 
 Please don't lash out at me. 
 Where did he go? 
 Oh, God! 
 Chuck? 
 Chuck? ! 
 Bennett's got him. He's probably dead by now. 
 Shut up and drive! 
 I'm a little tall for something like this. 
 Is there another seating option, perhaps? 
 Ell, are you sure you're okay registering for a wedding here at the Buy More? 
 Whatever your parents want. 
 You think you may not need a vacuum sealer, but suddenly the Chief of Surgery is coming over with her husband for salmon kabobs, and voila, Saturday's party turns into Sunday's picnic. 
 Why not? Can't hurt? 
 Ooh, camcorder. 
 Ah, first for the honeymoon, then the grandkids. 
 Dad! 
 Crossing the line. 
 Before you say anything, I know they're coming on strong, but they're just really excited. 
 They know your parents aren't around. 
 That's fine. I know that they're just trying to help. 
 And you know, they're, they're awesome. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Lester, you seen Chuck? 
 Maybe. 
 So, is he around? 
 Don't know. Could be. 
 Can you find him for me? 
 Yeah, sure, I could, but, uh, wouldn't that be more fulfilling for you if you did it yourself? 
 Look, I'm so sorry. It's a stupid store contest. 
 I can help you, but do me a solid and do not mention it on this card. 
 Yes? Thank you, buddy. 
 LOCKED The signal from the watch is getting stronger. Chuck's close. 
 Casey, what are you doing? 
 The vic can take the hit. 
 Oh, no, not good, not good. 
 Wait. I've got Chuck. 
 It says the signal is... the signal is right in front of us. 
 No, Casey, stop, stop! Chuck's in the car! 
 You're gonna kill Chuck! 
 Oh, fast. And he's driving very, very fast. 
 Casey! 
 It's actually more spacious in here than you might think. 
 Hey! 
 Freeze! 
 John, it's good to see you. 
 Keep your hands on your head. 
 You survived my trap. Very good. 
 Get on your knees. 
 I followed your career, John. 
 You survived torture at the hands of Baath separatists. 
 You did two years undercover in Afghanistan. 
 Could you have done any of that without me? 
 No. 
 Of course not. 
 My training saved you. 
 I came here to ask you something. 
 Be my student again. 
 Take your training to the next level. 
 That's it? 
 That's all you got? 
 That's how you're turning the others? 
 Save your breath. I'm no traitor. 
 Obviously, I made a mistake. 
 You aren't good enough for my team. 
 Hey! 
 So Bennett got away. 
 Again. 
 If you don't mind me asking, where was the Intersect during all of this? 
 Well, technically I was in Bennett's trunk, so I didn't see anything that happened, but it sounded very exciting. 
 Wait. So, Major, while you were playing your game of chicken, Chuck was in Bennett's trunk? 
 As soon as we ascertained the Intersect's location, Major Casey disengaged. 
 Sounds like Bennett has decided to make this personal, Casey, and so have you. 
 I'm pulling you off the case. 
 With all due respect... 
 This is why I didn't tell you about Bennett. 
 I knew you would turn it into a vendetta. 
 I'm bringing in another team to clean up your mess. 
 But I know Bennett. I know how he operates. 
 You're forgetting your primary objective is protecting the Intersect. 
 You will remain in Castle until the mission is completed. 
 Consider it a cooling-off period. 
 You little... 
 I didn't know this was going to happen. 
 I didn't know... tell him I didn't know this was going to happen! 
 If my primary objective wasn't to protect you... I KILL YOU. 
 I can't believe it. 
 Beckman was out of line pulling me off this mission. 
 I agree with her. 
 You're too emotionally involved. 
 This from the agent that can't keep her chocolate out of Bartowski's peanut butter. 
 Whatever my feelings may be for Chuck, I never knowingly endangered the asset. 
 You let your anger toward Bennett cloud your judgment. 
 You finally admit that you do have feelings for the nerd. 
 No, all I will admit to is having feelings. 
 20 years in the business has taught me one sure thing- that people... people let you down in the end. 
 Well, it's nice to know where we stand. 
 Did you talk to Casey? 
 Is he mad? 
 I feel horrible. 
 Casey is always mad. That's his baseline. 
 I never should have said all that stuff in front of the general. 
 No, your assessment was accurate. 
 I mean, the facts are the facts. 
 True, but the guy's going through a lot. 
 If I were really a friend, I would look past what he's saying and remember how he's feeling. 
 I mean, I should know better than anybody what he's going through right now. 
 Chuck, you're so sweet. 
 But, you know, an apology is not going to work, because Casey is combat ready at all times. 
 Which means his feelings are liabilities. 
 Well, aren't you supposed to be combat ready at all times? 
 I'll meet you at your sister's wedding tasting after your Buy More shift. 
 And please, don't go downstairs. 
 Leave Casey alone. 
 If it isn't Tweedledee, Tweedledum and... Tweedledumber. 
 Oh, congratulations goes out to you. 
 What do we win, a prize or something? 
 Well, of all the incompetent employees in this backwater branch, you three have distinguished yourselves- with the lowest customer evaluation scores in recorded history. 
 Really? 
 What... how low exactly? 
 Are we talking like truly abysmal, or... ? 
 Combined your highest score was a one. 
 Dare to dream, baby. 
 All right. 
 Well, since none of you seem to be taking this Employee of the Month contest very seriously, I must abandon the carrot, and use my stick. 
 You sure that's legal? 
 From now on, the employee with the lowest scores will close up every Saturday night for an entire month. 
 All right, stop. 
 You can't do this to us, okay? 
 I'm sorry, I can't? 
 Saturday's are sacred. 
 I can't work on Shabbat. 
 Yeah. It's date night. 
 Laundry night? 
 It's two-for-one night. 
 You're wasting time. 
 You have one night to raise your scores. 
 You better get crackin'. 
 This is my employee discount card. 
 It's good for 20% off anything in the store. Go nuts. 
 Just put in a good word for me on your way out. 
 No, mind? 
 Why would I mind? 
 Just let me get this puppy loaded up for you and then I'll come right back for sub... 
 Four stars? ! 
 I just kissed your ass for four lousy stars? ! 
 What do you people want from me! 
 Just spit in my face next time! 
 Hey, Jeff. 
 How's it going, man? You all right? 
 I think I'm getting the hang of this customer service stuff. 
 ENTER Yeah... 
 ACCESS DENIED Casey, hey. Hey, how you doing? 
 Get down here. 
 Um, look, I'm glad you called, because I was actually going to call you to say sorry... - I don't care if it's your time of the month, Bartowski. 
 Get down here please. 
 I don't... I don't think I can. 
 Sarah said not to. 
 Listen, buddy... 
 I started training under Ty Bennett when I was 23 years old. 
 I was an idiot back then. 
 I wasn't good enough to qualify for his program, but he took me on anyway. 
 You know, so, he taught me everything I know- self-discipline, duty. 
 I don't know what to think here, pal. 
 I'm feeling kind of exposed. 
 I feel like my whole foundation has been undermined here. 
 He was like, a... 
 I can't talk about this over the phone. 
 No, no, I'm glad you're finally opening up to me. 
 Be right there. 
 Thanks, buddy. 
 Hey... 
 Hey, buddy, I'm sorry, I got here as fast as I could. 
 And I wanted to tell you seriously what I was saying on the phone earlier- 
 I am sorry, man. 
 I know, your sensei from the past... it's very personal... 
 Yeah. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Let go. What are you doing? 
 Oh, oh, gentle. 
 Now, Intersect, flash. 
 This is the surveillance footage from the crash. 
 Casey, it doesn't work like that, okay? 
 I can't just flash on cue... 
 Okay, okay, 1919 Mulholland Drive. 
 It's a martial arts dojo, but also a cover for Bennett's illegal activity. 
 Good work, Intersect. 
 You know, I think you should reconsider this whole cooling-off period. 
 I think General Beckman was onto something when she said you should stay down here... 
 Come on, I need that eyeball. 
 Casey, what has gotten into you? ! 
 What is going on? This is totally uncharacteristic... 
 I've never seen you disobey an order. 
 What are you, nuts, crazy, out of your mind? 
 Okay, that's it- I'm calling Sarah. 
 You know what, Chuck? 
 I think I might owe you an apology now. 
 That's very nice of you. 
 Huh? What's it for? 
 The lying, the name-calling, the emotional manipulation? 
 Nope. For this. 
 Wait, no, no. 
 No, Casey, no, no, no, wait, wait wait. You don't understand. 
 I have dinner with Ellie tonight and we're tasting food for her wedding. 
 I can't miss it. 
 You know, when I was Bennett's student, I struggled with my calm. 
 He said I held too much anger and that made me weak. 
 Sometimes when I see your face, Bartowski, my calm center just wants to... 
 You tell anyone where I'm going, and this is yours. 
 What? Hey! 
 Use the Force. Use the Force, Chuck. 
 So, you're sure it's all right to start without Chuck? 
 Yeah, he has a tendency to run late. 
 Yeah, it's like the kid's in his own world half the time. 
 Must drive you crazy, Sarah. 
 Oh, I'm pretty used to it, actually. 
 And Chuck always has a good excuse. 
 So we are all in agreement then? 
 Yes to the trout,  no to the beef au jus. 
 And what was your favorite cake, Ellie? 
 Um... 
 Oh, it doesn't matter. 
 Let's agree on the red velvet. 
 Big fan. 
 And I love sorbet between courses. 
 Great idea, Woody. 
 So, are you going to wear your hair up? 
 Wait a second... 
 I just had a brilliant idea. 
 White ties. 
 Woody looks so handsome in a white tie. 
 That's not too formal is it? 
 I don't know. 
 And I know you're not in contact with your dad, so I would be honored, really, to walk you down the aisle on your wedding day. 
 You know, guys, maybe we should just table the wedding talk. 
 Um, no. 
 I have something I'd like to say, actually. 
 Um, I said yes to the big wedding and I said yes to the burgundy organza bridesmaid dresses, and I just can't say yes anymore. 
 And I'm sorry, I know that you're trying to help, but the answer is no. 
 I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
 Babe... 
 Sorry. 
 Sweetie... sweetheart... 
 Sweetheart? 
 Well, Sarah... so you're in the yogurt game? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, yogurt. 
 Come on, baby. Come on, baby. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Yes. 
 Woody... 
 Huh? 
 I think we should go for a walk and give the kids some time to themselves. 
 Oh, it's Ellie's phone. 
 Oh, it's Chuck. Should I answer it? 
 Oh, I'll take it. Thank you. 
 Hey, Chuck, where are you? 
 Sarah, Sarah, thank God. 
 Listen, um... 
 Casey threatened my life, so technically I can't tell you... 
 What? 
 Well, you could guess though. Yeah, you could guess. 
 Chuck, I don't have time for games. 
 Just guess! 
 I'll tell you if you're hot or cold. 
 And FYI, this place is very cold. 
 It's... it's practically frozen. 
 You're at Orange Orange. 
 Bingo! Yes, you're amazing! 
 Let me guess- you went down into the Castle and Casey used you to get out and then he locked you in the Orange Orange and now he's going after Bennett. 
 Wow. That's very impressive. How did you... ? 
 Okay. Where did he go? 
 You didn't hear this from me. 1919 Mulholland Drive. 
 Can you get out? 
 No. No. Not until you get down here and get the key to get me out of these handcuffs. 
 Good. Then stay there. 
 What? No, no, no! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, Sarah! No, no! Wait! 
 Those seven years of MacGyver finally paid off. 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 You want to stop me, you're going to have to kill me. 
 Well, I'm your partner, and I'm not letting you go in alone. 
 Okay. 
 Come on. 
 Um... computer emergency? 
 I was waiting in the car. 
 I swear. 
 Hello, John. 
 And friends. 
 This is unfortunate. 
 No matter where you run, where you hide, I'm going to be there, waiting. 
 Please be careful. 
 Always so proud, so righteous, John. 
 But I have business to attend to. 
 I can't have you interfering. 
 I thought you were a man of honor. 
 If I'm not good enough to make your team, surely you could defeat me without the gun. 
 Withhonor. 
 You're right. 
 My students, this is a special lesson: How to kill a man with honor. It will happen very quickly. 
 Eye of the tiger, buddy. 
 Shut up, Chuck. 
 Sorry. 
 We're in trouble, aren't we? 
 Use the snake on him. Get around him. 
 Come on! Come on! 
 Casey, hit him! 
 He's outmatched. 
 You lost your calm, John. 
 Your center is filled with conflict. 
 That's it. 
 Casey... Casey! Casey, you gotta get up. 
 You gotta get up. 
 Run for it, Chuck. Go. 
 It's too bad, really. 
 I was hoping my men would see better skills from a former student of mine. 
 Look. Look, I get how you're feeling, man. I totally get how you're feeling. You're feeling betrayed by someone that you really care about. 
 You're damaging my calm, Chuck. 
 You've spent so much of your life- pushing people away. 
 Lashing out with purple words and... and punches. 
 But I know why you do it. 
 You do it because you're scared. 
 What? 
 Scared. Scared to be known. 
 Scared that, if we see who you really are, we'd actually care about you. 
 You shut up! 
 Yeah. Shut up, Chuck. You're making him mad. 
 Underneath that extremely terrifying exterior lies a man who deeply, deeply feels. 
 You care. You care about us. 
 You care about me. Admit it. You feel all warm and mushy about me. 
 Go ahead. Say it. 
 You love me, John Casey. 
 I'm going to kill you! 
 Wait, wait, wait! Hold on. No. Not me. 
 Him. 
 Nice work, sensei. 
 Yeah. Well, the thing is, Casey doesn't really have a calm center. 
 It's more of an angry center. 
 There he is. 
 There's your sensei. 
 Take a good look at him. 
 Who's next? 
 Hands on your heads! 
 You called Beckman. 
 What? It's not my fault. 
 She guessed. 
 And now it's time to announce this month's 
 Employee of the Month. 
 And, for what it's worth, you all tried your... best. 
 The employee with the highest level of customer service is... 
 Skip Johnson! 
 It's not my fault. I tried to be a jerk. 
 Oh, congratulations! 
 Clearly, there is no prize that I could give you that would compare to the satisfaction of having your name and photo immortalized on a Buy More plaque. 
 What did I tell ya? 
 So lame. 
 However, please accept this one-time only bonus gift. 
 A 65-inch flat screen TV. 
 Well, thanks for saving my life today, Chuck. 
 Anytime, Casey. Yeah. 
 You know what? You're my friend. 
 Yeah. You know what? You're my friend, too. 
 Well, that's really kind of you, Casey. Have a good night. 
 Thank you. 
 You said something, didn't you? You said something. 
 You said something! 
 I heard that. I heard that. 
 Hey. 
 Sorry I missed tonight. 
 I got stuck at work. 
 It's okay. Sarah told me. 
 Uh... Where are Awesome's parents? 
 He's, um... he's taking them to the airport. 
 I really am sorry about missing the dinner, Ell. 
 I mean, I know it's important for you to let your future in-laws meet your family and... 
 You know, I, um... 
 I've never been one of those girls that dreamed about what their wedding day would be like. 
 What I would wear. 
 Even the person that I would marry. 
 It was all kind of, uh... kind of hazy. 
 Except... except one thing was clear- 
 That Dad would walk me down the aisle. 
 Hey, Ellie. 
 I know it's not going to happen. 
 It's just... it's just really hard to let go of that. 
 ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD. 
 The number you have reached is not in service. 
 What is it? 
 Dad's going to walk you down the aisle. 
 You can't say that, Chuck. 
 I know that you want that for me, but we haven't heard from him in a really long time. 
 Yeah. Well, I'm going to find him. 
 I'm a smart guy. 
 I can do that. 
 And, when he hears about the wedding, he'll be here for you. 
 Come on. You really think he's going to make it? 
 I guarantee it.
