 Previously on "Chuck"... 
 There are a few things you might need to know. Don't hurt him again. I won't. The hotel's booked, so we should probably go if we're gonna beat traffic. With this list, it's just a matter of time before we learn the identities of FULCRUM's agents. Oh, wow! Chuck, look at this view! It's amazing. Chuck? It's just a Ferris wheel. It's fine. Ah. Yeah. Yeah, it's not the... it's not the wheel so much as it is me. What? What does that mean? I kind of sort of bribed the carny to stop us at the top. Well, for someone who's afraid of heights, that was pretty moronic. I was going for... romantic, but... Okay, here goes. Uh... Jill, we... we've been friends for... for, like, a semester now, right? And it's been really fun. And I was just... I was thinking that maybe, you know, uh, you and I... we could, I don't know... You know what? You're right. I-I... What am I thinking? You're right. This is moronic. I... You were happy being friends, and I'm happy being friends, and I just thought... Chuck, there is a problem. You talk way, way too much. Jill Roberts is FULCRUM? And she has Chuck? How is that possible? Well, the LaFleur List contained a code name our computer translated to one Jill Roberts. By the time we saw it, they were already gone. His cell is switched off, and his watch is still in the apartment. Find him. I don't care how. Just do it. You know, it doesn't matter. FULCRUM's working him over about now. He's not gonna last an hour. No, you're wrong. They don't know Chuck's the Intersect, and they don't know Jill has been burned. Well, if it ain't torture... what are they doing to him? We have ways to make you talk, Mr. Bartowski. Do your worst. There's gonna be yelling. Well, was it worth it? Was it worth it? Mmm. It was so worth it. Good. I'm going to take a shower. You deal with the yelling, okay? Okay. Have fun. Oh, that's not good. Jill, your phone's buzzing. What? Oh, no. No, no, no, no! This can't be happening. What was that, Chuck? Nothing! Um, nothing at all, actually. I was just saying, I'm a little... I'm a little, uh, parched, 'cause-cause, well, last night was incredible. You know? Like, we had some fun, didn't we? Then I was thinking, hey, you want some coffee? Yeah, that'd be great. Okay, great, great. Oh! You idiot! You sad-sack, bleeding heart idiot! She's-She's... Chuck, never do that again. It's Jill. I think... . We know. We know. Wait. This-This has got to be a mistake, okay? I've known Jill for eight years, since college, and we-we had this really amazing... night. Look, she's not a spy, and she has no FULCRUM code name. The code name was... Wait, wait, wait. Don't say it. Sandstorm. Oh, my God. Jill's a spy. I'm sorry, Chuck. What do you mean I have to go back in there? Think, Bartowski. We don't want Jill to know that we know she's a spy, right? Oh, okay, look, okay. Jill is FULCRUM. FULCRUM is looking for the Intersect,  and the Intersect just happens to be me. Chuck, they don't know that. Trust me. We're right here. Everything will be fine. You will be safe. Yeah. Buck up, soldier. FULCRUM pulled one on us. Let's return the favor. Oh! Thank you, sweetie. Oh... You're welcome... darling. ♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪ 
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪ 
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪ 
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪ 
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪ 
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪ Chuck, are you sure everything's okay? Huh? Yeah. Everything's fantastic. It's great. This is me on the verge of total happiness. Okay, do you want to do something tonight? Um, yeah, I would... I would love to, but the problem is, the apartment is not safe. My sister's back, and I can't blow my cover, so... Well, we can go out. Okay. All right. Okay. Bye. Drive safe. Are you okay? You know, for a few days, I thought things were going to be different. I could have a life. I could have a girlfriend. I could be a regular human being. I thought Jill was... Different? No. Normal. How could this happen? Jill must have been recruited when she was at Stanford. FULCRUM uses leadership seminars to look for possible agents. Excuse me, I'm sorry, General, but who in my life isn't a spy? My sister? My best friend? Should I just start asking people that when I first meet them? Hi. I'd like the extra value meal, and while we're on the topic, do you covertly work for a government espionage faction? Your flash in Jill's room referenced an agent called Leader. We want you to use your relationship with Jill, see if she makes contact with him. General, Chuck is not ready for this type of mission. He could barely handle a good-bye with Jill. She's going to see right through him. This is our best opportunity to infiltrate FULCRUM, but if you don't think he's ready... I'll do it. Jill betrayed me twice. You bet I'll do it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't sit down! What? What? What? What? What? What? What is it? Devon's parents are coming tomorrow for Thanksgiving, and the couch is... perfect. Okay, perfect. The Awesomes? The Awesomes are coming here? Yes, the Very Awesomes are coming here. They make their son look mildly impressive. Sis, you got nothing to worry about. They love you. Huh. I guess when you're a doctor, and you marry a doctor, and you raise three awesome boys, you tend to judge people a little harsher. I guess that's how I feel when Mrs. Awesome is around. I have never heard you use the nickname that many times. I know. I know. It's okay. I'm just a little stressed right now, but we all have our burdens to bear. Hey, Chuck, yo! Hey, yo! What? Anybody here? Like whom? Like whom? Like, the other woman, dude. Jill. Morgan, there is no other woman. Really? That's great, 'cause I thought I was gonna have to do some sort of intervention or something. You know, help you with your addiction to really attractive women. What's that smell? Uh, probably Ellie. She's doing some practice cooking for tomorrow. Naturally. Tomorrow's Thanksgiving. So, that smell is... turkey. Morgan? Morgan? ! I need you to try this. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Oh, my God. It's heaven. No. No, it's too... it's too dry. Test turkey #1 is too dry. Uh, three hours, seven minutes. What are you doing? No, no, no, no. Ellie, what are you... ? Oh, my God. Okay, Morgan, we need to talk. It's fine. Please just don't hurt another turkey like that. Morgan, this Thanksgiving is very important. Sure. And things need to run smoothly. I know. I know. You've been so stressed. Everything's great. It's perfect. What can I do? Morgan? Yeah? You're... Not invited! I can't believe this. I mean, how? Uninvited to T-day... Morgan, Morgan, relax. I don't know how many times I have to tell you. It's all going to be okay. I'm gonna talk to Ellie, and we're gonna sort it out. Anna's out of town, and you guys were my only hope. If I don't Thanksgiving with you... Morgan! Morgan, breathe. Excuse me, sir? Hi. Can I help you? Grimes! With me. Okay. Did I just hear you don't have Thanksgiving plans? That's terrible, damn terrible. I'm amazed to find so many staff members without proper plans for Thanksgiving. Like these two poor creatures. Sir, are you inviting us to dinner? No... God, no. I need you lonely bastards to stand guard here at the store on Thanksgiving. Stand guard? Yeah, because of Black Friday. We have more product in the store than ever before, and you three are gonna make certain nobody steals it. Answer it. Not on the first ring. It implies an eagerness that I'm not really feeling right now. Ow, ow, ow, ow. Hi, hi, hi, Jill. A-a date? Tonight? Yeah, sounds... sounds great. Where? It's a surprise. Of course I can tell my bodyguards to take the night off so we can be alone. Just the two of us. I'm looking forward to it as well. Ow, ow! What are you doing? What was that for? The kissy noise. Have some self-respect, Bartowski. You're a man. I got to go talk to Sarah. What... what is it? Sarah, I need your help. How am I gonna survive tonight? Well, a good spy knows what their mark wants. And what do we know about Jill? She's a spy; she wants you to be under her spell. Okay, how do I do that? She's gonna test you. When the time is right, she's gonna make certain that she has you, that you love her. How is she gonna do that? When you're most exposed. Emotionally exposed. Like a... an intimate moment, say, a kiss. Okay. Imagine that I am Jill. The moment is romantic. She's close to you. She's looking into your eyes. Got it, okay. You got... I-I got that. I'm trying not to be distracted by the oh-so-romantic secret base. Concentrate, Chuck. Keep looking into my eyes. Don't look up. And if you can't hold Jill's stare, look at her lips. Good. Now, move her hair back over her ear. And when you start to kiss, focus again on her. And just before your lips are about to meet, close your eyes. Okay, good. Good, you're all set. Huh? Oh, yeah, good. Hey. NSA just picked up a purchase on Jill's credit card. Two tickets to some stupid concert down at the Music Center. Better not be another freaking opera. Well, we'll be there waiting for you. Look, just remember, Jill is capable of anything. You look great. Sorry to keep you waiting. So, what do you think of my surprise? Uh, weren't-weren't we supposed to... What? Nothing, nothing. If I seem tense, it's just my irrational fear of carnivals acting up on me. Oh, right. Come here. I've got another surprise for you. You saw this coming, didn't you? You bribed a carny. You know what happens next? You get really, really nervous, and then you ramble on for a couple seconds, and then... I have to kiss you. I'm sorry, Chuck. For what? What are you doing? I work for a group called FULCRUM. You know who they are, don't you, Chuck? I plan to eliminate you. Jill, please don't do this. Believe me, Chuck. I don't want to. I'm not a killer. This isn't what I do for a living. You pull that trigger, and it is what you do for a living. You already broke my heart. Is it necessary for you to shoot it as well? You're right. Okay, Chuck, here's the truth. There's a FULCRUM operative down there. He's watching us right now. I'm supposed to transport you to a car in the parking lot, and if I don't follow their plan, they're gonna eliminate you and me as a precaution. We're almost to the Music Center. What's the ETA on Chuck and the FULCRUM agent? Wait, I lost him. His signal just dropped off the grid. What? ! It was a ghost. Turn us around, Casey, now! They're not at the Music Center. North 101. Go! Chuck, you have to do exactly what I say, okay? I think you should know that my completely rational fear of carnivals has spread to ex-girlfriends. I mean, how do I know I can trust you? How do I know you're not just gonna take me to the parking lot to do something you said you wouldn't? Oh, no. It's him. Who's him? Him who? Leader. Okay, come here. Um, excuse us, person we don't know, you're blocking us. His handlers are closing in. Eliminate him. What, here? Don't think. Shoot him in the head and let's go. Did-did you... did you just say... Let's talk about this first. Think I should just leave if there's a... ow! This is a test, Jill. Do it now. Too late. You're making a big mistake. Sorry, sorry, excuse me! Mr. Bartowski. You need to come with me. Um, you told Jill to shoot me. Why would I ever go anywhere with you? I'd rather not leave your body here on the ride. What if some kid saw it? Wow, that's, uh... that's strangely considerate of you. Okay. That's exactly how I feel. Chuck, you have to trust me. Jill? I'm not gonna hurt you. Where are you? Jill, where are you? Why are you doing this? When did you join FULCRUM and why? It started at Stanford. They sponsored a leadership seminar. After school, whatever job we wanted, they got us. They made our dreams come true. Couldn't you get out? When someone controls every part of your life, Chuck, you have to do what they say. After a while, I found myself doing things I never thought I would have done, but... but then it was too late. Too late for what? Jill? Jill! I'm impressed, Mr. Bartowski. I wasn't really certain you were a spy, but... now I see. Good-bye. Chuck, come on. Don't move! No, no, wait, wait, wait! Don't hurt her. She saved my life. ♪ ♪ So one more time, what's the plan? We stay here in the store all day. Anything goes wrong, we call you. Good. Remember, you three are the last line of defense against... Yeah, but, can I... this is a bit overkill. Overkill? Dude. Grimes, my first store was The Husky Lad: Big and Tall. "For the more than average man. " It was robbed. Thanksgiving of '88. That was a dark day, Morgan. Husky lads throughout Burbank went without britches for Christmas. The store closed before the new year. So, no... it's not overkill. It's business. Sure. Um, but before you lock us in, um, isn't there some sort of law or rule about locking us in the store? I mean, what if there's a fire? I'm not worried about a fire. I'm worried about thieves. All right, Lady Big Mike is cooking with the family; I got fish to catch. Lady Big Mike? 
 
 Everything's going to be all right. Answer all of our questions with a "yes" or "no. " Okay. Is your name Jill Roberts? Yes. Did you attend Stanford University? Yes. Can I ask a follow-up question? You're about to leave through that window. I rescind my follow-up question. Do you have a degree in molecular biology? Yes. Are you a FULCRUM agent? No. Wait... I'm sorry. Telling the truth is new to me. Yes, I am a FULCRUM agent. Do you know the current whereabouts of your FULCRUM handler, codename Leader? Do you know the current whereabouts of your FULCRUM handler... Yes. Give us the location now. Tell me now or I lose my calm. Jill. Jill, just tell, just tell him. Please, just tell him. Okay, I'm not supposed to know this, but FULCRUM has a mobile medical unit. You'll find Leader recovering in an office building in downtown Los Angeles. Is this a trap? No. What about Jill, Sarah? I know what you're thinking. That Jill is the same person that you went to school with, and the same person that you dated. But we cannot be certain. Trust me, Chuck. You can't trust her. Is he setting a trap? Mm-hmm. Good friend Jeffrey's been doing this job for, give or take, 15 years. This is his Thanksgiving tradition. Amazing. How many traps does he set? Just the one trip wire, it's kind of sad. He tripped over it last year. Anyway, bon appétit, buddy. Mmm. Turkey in plastic? No, no. Les, this is all wrong. This is not what Thanksgiving's about. This is pathetic. Dude. What? What else is there? There's so much more. Man, yeah, there's-there's fun, and food, and friends. And that's, that's just the Fs. Where? Out there. Morgan, we can't leave. Dude, what if I could bring it back here? A turkey. We, we... No, not-not, not like this. A real turkey? Yes! What do I have to do to get this... real turkey? ♪ ♪ Okay, motor's off. Come on. Dude, we got to push harder here. I'm trying. I'm trying. Come on. This is such a fire hazard. Look, look, look. Okay, okay. Hold, hold, you got to hold it. Ow! Jeff! Open the door, buddy. Open the door. Okay. Oh, my Lord. Jeff! Got it. Okay, nice, Jeff. Now can you open the door that is currently chopping me in half? Oops. My bad. Okay, just pull. Just pull. Did he make it? Security breach at Buy More location 2453. Security breach at Buy More location 2453. T-time is 45 minutes. What time are your parents getting here? Okay. Mm-hmm. I love you, too. Babe... Hmm? I got some news. My parents can't make it. Don't toy with my emotions right now, Devon. Honey, I wouldn't dare. You're serious? Yeah. Oh, that's great! Oh, that's so great! Oh, my God. Now can we just have some fun? Yes! Listen to Chuck's stories. Laugh at Morgan as he o-faces through his, his mashed potatoes and stuffing. Oh, no! I uninvited Morgan. He's like the one person who loves this dinner more than everyone. Ah, man, some animals got in the trash again. Oh, what? Well, I saw you put it in the bag. You know, and I figured it was still gonna be good. So I... Okay. Morgan, I'm so sorry that I uninvited you to Thanksgiving. Please, please forgive me. Forgive you? Yeah, of course. Yes, I understand. I completely understand. I mean, you've been so stressed out with this whole thing and, you know, with our new boss at work and this Chuck and Jill thing is like... What Chuck and Jill thing? Hmm? What Jill thing? I didn't say anything... Morgan, you tell me everything that you know. Mm-hmm. Absolutely, I will. Can I just get one small favor? I need to invite a couple guests over. Chuck? Hey. Hey. I was just seeing if you, you know, if you needed a water or something. No, I'm good. Are Casey and Sarah ready to start again? Um, no. No, not just yet. But before they do, I was wondering if I could maybe ask you a few things. Do you know how to work all this stuff? Yeah, totally. I, uh, read the manual. You read a lie detector manual? No, this is the manual for the entire Castle base. Oh, you read a manual for a base? Well, you know, I mean, um... I skimmed it. Would you, uh, would you mind if I ask you a couple questions? Go ahead. Back at Stanford, when we were dating, was that for real? Yes. You really liked me? Those were real emotions? Yes. Okay, then, well then why did you sleep with Bryce right after I got kicked out of school? Chuck, it has to be a "yes" or "no" question or it won't work. Did you love him, too? No. Great. That's great. That makes it even worse. There's a question you're not asking. It's right there, and you're not asking it. Did you sleep with Bryce? No. I didn't. Everyone freeze! Take 'em all out of here. Except this one on the table. He's mine. So you're telling me that for the last six years of my life I've been believing that you betrayed me. Why would you do that? When you got kicked out of school, my FULCRUM advisor said that I had to let you go. Now you weren't talking to Bryce, so that was the easiest way to do it. I'm so sorry, Chuck. I don't believe this. FULCRUM told you to dump me? I didn't have a choice. I guess in your defense, when they told you to kill me, you didn't do it. So, I guess that means something. It does. I never wanted to hurt you, Chuck, ever. You were my first love. Do you think that when this is all over, we could try again? Get me out of these. Yes. Chuck, we have Leader. We're taking him back to Castle. Great. See you when you get back. I'm sorry, Chuck. Chuck? Chuck, what's the matter? You promised that you wouldn't hurt them. Put the guns on the table, take the cuffs off now. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I let her out. It's my fault. I'm sorry. Now, I believe we were headed to a holding area. Show me the way. Chuck, do what he says and you'll be okay. What about my friends? Just do what he says. How could you do this, Jill? Chuck, it's complicated. Listen, I know complicated, okay? How could you do this? You did an excellent job, my dear. Show him the access screen for the Joint Intelligence Database. Um, I'm sorry. I don't know how to do that. Do it now or I'll kill your friends, starting with the blonde. Thank you, Chuck. This was all a trick, wasn't it? I mean, you guys just did all this just to get in here and access our computer. Y-You, you let her shoot you. Devious, aren't we? Move him. Oh, baby. Jill, you're making a big mistake. I have to do what he says, Chuck. Why? Why? What is your boss searching for? I mean, what, what secret is worth this? He's searching for someone. Who? Bryce Larkin. Bryce? Why are you looking for Bryce? Chuck, don't try and protect him. We know he's CIA. He stole something from us. They're looking for the Intersect. I'm sorry, Sarah. I should have listened to you. We'll figure something out. Actually, I have a plan. Hey, what are you doing? That's the Castle manual. I told you that's top secret. Yeah, I know. So am I. Chuck. What did you do? Like I told Jill, I read the manual. What... did you do? Well, I locked you out of the computer system using the remote console that every room in Castle is equipped with. It's in the manual. Unfortunately, said manual is in here with me, and since I overrode Castle's primary controls, we're now safely locked within these bulletproof cells. Devious, aren't I? I'll make one call and my men will be here in 20 minutes. I'm so glad you brought that up because I also activated the base's communications jammer, so no calls out-- sorry about that-- and because I triggered the CIA's trouble alarm, I think the cavalry's going to be here in ten minutes or so. The nerd in me really, really wants to say "Checkmate" right about now. Never say that. Why? Because you don't know who you're playing against. These cells might be bulletproof, but they can't withstand that. The blast will kill them, but I'll bet your cell will be fine. Chuck, don't do anything. Stay in that cell, Bartowski. Jill? Just do what he says, Chuck. Open the door or your friends will die. Good-bye, Mr. Bartowski. W-W-W-W-Wait! Wait. Now, show me the way out of here. Jill, if you hurt him, I swear... It's a message from Chuck. ♪ ♪ Drop it! Sarah, don't hurt her! Jill, Jill. Hey, I can help you. Come with me. Come on. You thought you were going to take me down? No, baby, I am! I hate thieves. Grimes put you in charge? Yeah. Smart boy. What's going on? What are we doing? Look... you're taking the Matrix, okay? All-wheel drive, touch screen navi, iPod capability, and a full tank of gas. It's the perfect getaway car. Just get in and drive as far as you can. I won't call it in, I swear. Thank you. Come with me. We can still be together. How? Just you and me. No secrets, no spies. Come with me, Chuck. No, I, I can't. I can't. I... look, obviously, there's the whole "opposites attract" chemistry thing that we have, and I, I... it's just the-there's, there's one small problem. What are you doing, Chuck? What's going on? Don't do this to me, Chuck. You should know I wanted to help you. I was going to let you get away. Chuck, no. But when you were about to kill Sarah, you made the decision for me. You're under arrest, Jill, and I'm breaking up with you. I'm sorry, Sarah. I should have listened to you from the beginning. You were right: I wasn't ready for this mission. No one is ready for this type of mission, Chuck. Your girlfriend being FULCRUM isn't something they teach you in spy school. I'm just too trusting. Ever since I was a kid, I really wanted to believe what everybody always told me. You know? I'm just getting used to this new job-- all the spying and lying. Don't get used to it. What makes you special is that you're not like every other spy. You're a good guy, and you want to help people. Leave the deception to me. I'm glad I have you. ♪ ♪ Yeah, we're better as a team. Oh, yeah. Happy Thanksgiving. Can I borrow you? Sorry, I'm stealing him real quick. Are you absolutely certain that Jill is not with Chuck? Yeah, I mean, that's what he, that's what he tol... Why, you think that Chuck's gonna break up with Sarah? Well, I hope not. Yeah, me, too. You know what we need here? What? Thanksgiving miracle. Yeah, y-y-yeah, listen. Chuck and Sarah are gonna walk through that door, they're going to be as happy as can be, and everything's going to be fine. Wow, good job, Morgan. Hi. I could have asked for anything. Happy Thanksgiving. Hi. Happy Thanksgiving. Ellie, uh, do you, do you realize that Lester and Jeff of the Nerd Herd are at our table right now? Is everything okay? Yes, well, the Awesomes couldn't make it, so you know me-- just expand Thanksgiving. Okay. Happy Thanksgiving. You, too. Are you okay? Of course, yeah. Why, why do you ask? Well, because Morgan told me about you and Jill. I'm sorry. I just... I was worried about you. Um, no, yeah, everything's good. She wanted to see if we could work it out and maybe give it a second try. And? And I realized that Jill, Stanford, and Bryce-- that's the story from my past. But my new story is you and Sarah and these... frigging yahoos. And sometimes... it can be a really fun story. Uh, Swedish bikini team. Uh, DeLorean, flying DeLorean. Hey, Morgan. Come on, buddy. So anyways, where was I? Yeah, you were saying how, how the turkey gets made. You were saying that the turkeys volunteer. No, they don't. It's more of a draft. Toast to, uh, some of the great, uh, faces that I know and some new ones to Thanksgiving. Yeah, we don't know each other. Hear, hear. Happy Thanksgiving. Great job, babe. Done, first, complete. One, number one. I have to carve the turkey. Careful. Coming through.
