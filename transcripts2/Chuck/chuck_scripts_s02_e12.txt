 Hi. Joshua Gomez. 
 Welcome to  Chuck. 
 Do me a favor. 
 Put on your 3-D glasses right now. 
 Wow! That's cool. 
 That is pretty amazing stuff. 
 Chuck. 
 Chuck. 
 Chuck, wake up. 
 Sarah, what are... ? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Oh. 
 Okay, uh, Sarah? 
 Yes, Chuck? 
 This is a dream. 
 No, it isn't. 
 Come on. Who are we... 
 Who are we kidding here, huh? 
 This is... 
 This is clearly my-my subconscious at work. 
 And on behalf of my conscious self, I'd-I'd like to apologize. 
 I'm normally much more respectful of women even in my dreams. 
 It's just that, you know, anxiety and fear can-can really, um... affect your dream life. 
 And what are you afraid of? 
 I watched you kill that FULCRUM agent in cold blood. 
 Sarah, I am... I am not like you, okay? 
 I might have all these government secrets in my brain, but that does not make me a real spy. 
 I need to tell you this in reality, not in my dream. 
 Chuck. 
 Hey. 
 This isn't a dream. 
 Oh, what is it? 
 It's a nightmare. 
 That's not the way that dream was supposed to go. 
 Chuck, are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm absolutely 100% on it. Why? 
 Dude, you were totally screaming last night. 
 Like a little girl. 
 Honey. 
 It was crazy how high it was. 
 I'm sorry about that, but, yeah, I'm fe. 
 Bro, you're a tense coil of stressed-out negativity. 
 We don't mean to pry, but... 
 Actually, we do. We do. 
 What's stressing you out? 
 Nothing... particular. 
 You know, it's a little hectic at work and stuff. 
 Wow. I didn't realize life got so hectic at the Buy More. 
 Well, Chuck, maybe what you need is a day off. 
 Good prescription, babe. 
 Chuck, that's exactly what you need. 
 You need to blow off some steam, have some fun. 
 Take a day off, Chuck. 
 Dude, we got the day off. 
 What? What? What is... What is going on? 
 Tyler Martin is coming here. 
 Tyler Martin?  The  Tyler Martin? 
 Rock star Tyler Martin? 
 Rock star, legend, poet. 
 I've never actually heard him, but apparently, he had this huge promotion over at Large Mart, and they pulled the plug because of the whole s*x tape thing. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. Have you seen it? 
 No. 
 Well, anyway, Big Mike heard about it, and offered them our store. 
 Thank you, Big Mike. 
 That's what I'm saying. 
 Dude, this place is gonna be so packed to the gills, no one's even gonna notice that we're doing diddly squat. 
 Grimes! Over here now! 
 Have fun. 
 Grimes, got a job for you. 
 Old football buddy of mine, Jimmy Butterman, just got paroled. 
 I told his PO that we'd give him a job here at Buy More so he could get back on his feet. 
 An ex-con, sir? 
 I-I just... 
 Is that such a good idea? 
 He's a teammate, Grimes. 
 Teach him everything you know. 
 I will. 
 When you say prison, though, are you talking, like, bars and-and guards and, uh, showers? 
 Get out! 
 Get out. Getting... Okay. 
 Attention. 
 Attention! 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, when my personal friend, Mr. Martin, enters the store, there is to be no flash photography... 
 Oh! 
 ... no approaching of Mr. Martin of any kind, and most importantly, no touching! 
 Consider yourself warned. 
 Ooh! Sarah, Casey, there's a situation in the Buy More. 
 There is a guy with a grenade. 
 I'm heading toward the store now. 
 Where is he? 
 He's gone. 
 Where is the grenade? 
 Go! 
 Oh. 
 Don't open it! 
 It's a grenade. 
 Okay. 
 It's gonna blow anyway, idiot. I'll take it out front. 
 No, we can't take it out front. There's people out there. 
 We got to take it out the back. Oh. You stay here. 
 Casey! 
 Hey, that's my Tyler Martin display. 
 He is a hero of mine, Chuck. 
 Sorry, Lester. Emergency. 
 Nobody treats Lester like that. 
 Jeff, let go! 
 Throw it. 
 Chuck! 
 Interception! 
 Why are we playing keep away? 
 Oh! 
 Come on... 
 Oh, Grimes. 
 See you've met Mr. Butterman. 
 The other half of the Defense of Death. 
 Blow it up! 
 Blow it up! 
 What did we win? 
 Good morning, Sarah. 
 No time to diffuse it. 
 I got an idea. 
 Here. 
 Hold on. Open the door. 
 Get down! 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Oh. Good morning, Chuck.

 Agent Walker, Mr. Bartowski. 
 I'm sure you're wondering why would someone want Tyler Martin dead. 
 Not really. I mean, have you heard his music? 
 It's overly produced, the lyrics are completely banal. 
 I mean, Facebook even has a group called I Want To Kill Tyler Martin. 
 Not that I'm a member. 
 I wouldn't ever... 
 That's just wrong. 
 Why don't you just share with General Beckman the intel about the grenade that you flashed on? 
 It was an IG-88 thermite charge. 
 That's military. 
 Commonly used by North African intelligence units. 
 Interestingly, Tyler Martin recently completed a tour of Africa. 
 I want you to find out who was behind this attempt and why. 
 Well, the only way to do that is to question Tyler Martin. 
 Then bring him in. 
 It can't be that hard to get him alone. 
 All right. 
 Hello, Cleveland! 
 Yeah. 
 This is Burbank. 
 Oh. 
 Whatever. 
 Now, I would like to thank all of the humanitarians that have affected my work. 
 Mother Theresa, Nelson Mandela, God rest his soul. 
 And my personal favorite, Angelina Jolie. 
 As a thank you to all my beautiful fans who still buy CDs, I've included this, a ticket, a golden ticket... 
 A golden ticket? 
 Golden ticket! ... inside these. 
 My new CD. 
 It is a backstage invite to a benefit concert I'm having tomorrow night. 
 All right, we'll see you later. 
 That was great, Tyler. 
 Yeah. 
 This is gonna be huge for the Tyler Martin brand, you realize that? 
 How are we supposed to grab a rock star in broad daylight? 
 I mean, security's crawling all over the place. 
 Oh. 
 This is going to be easy. 
 What... ? 
 Catch you later, Gavin. 
 What's gonna be easy? 
 I'm such a fan, Mr. Martin. 
 Oh. 
 I'm a big fan of yours, too. 
 So, are you, uh, a model, actress? 
 Massage therapist? 
 Maybe a acrobat? 
 I can be whatever you want. 
 Ugh! 
 Idiot. 
 I think we got a pervert. 
 Oh, daisies. 
 Oh. 
 Nighty-night, Tyler. 
 How much tranquilizer did you use? 
 It's a high grade at a heavy dose. 
 Mr. Martin should be out for 12 to 24 hours. 
 Jet lag is brutal. 
 Rock star metabolism. 
 Oh. All the better for seeing you, darling, you know. 
 Oh. I feel like a daffodil. 
 Time for the road trip. 
 Road trip? Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going? 
 The Buy More parking lot camera has a match on the car the suspect drove this morning. 
 What about Tyler here? 
 Hmm? 
 Oh, check his mouth every 20 minutes, make sure he doesn't choke on his own tongue. 
 Hang on a second. You're-you're gonna go, and you want me to stay here and be on tongue watch duty? 
 Well, you don't have plans, do you? 
 Would it be so crazy if I did have plans? 
 Plans that involved something other than fixing a computer or playing hot potato with a thermite grenade? 
 Yes. 
 So, what's with Chuck? 
 The guy's got a point. He hasn't had a day off. If you ask me, we're lucky he didn't melt down months ago. No, I think it's something else. He's been acting strange since the holidays. Hold that thought. We got a real fan boy, huh? No, no, there's something wrong here. This is too neat. It's too orderly. Beckman was right. We're dealing with a pro. Golden ticket's got to be in here somewhere. I don't know, guys. I mean, you think this is right? This golden ticket's supposed to be for Tyler Martin fans. Hey, I am a fan. So am I. Yeah, so am I. So, Mr. Butterman, could you settle a bet? Say it's our first day in prison. Who do you think would be considered the weaker gazelle? You put anything in my mouth... I will bite down hard. That's it. The golden ticket! Oh, my God, Morgan! Please, please. I am so happy for us, buddy. Please, please. You don't want me to hurt them. Fellas... please. This ticket only entitles me to a plus one, okay, so we are gonna have to settle this... the Buy More way. This ticket is Lester's... and... and Butterman's. What? ! No, hey, hey, excuse me. This may be the most impressive restroom I've ever seen in my life. That ceiling looks just like the night sky. That's because that  is  the night sky. Oh. Have I made a mistake? No. Better question. Where am I? Who are you? I'm Chuck, my name is Chuck. And I... I work for the label. My record label? Yes, yes, your record label. There was a death threat against you earlier today, so we thought it might be good to move you to this secure location. All right, well... I'd better go. Um, um, Mr. Martin, you actually have to stay here for the night. The night? No, no, no, Jack. Chuck, actually. I get death threats all the time, okay? Besides... it's party night. It's Tuesday. Exactly. I've got to go. Um, you know what? Hey, hey, how about... I'm just gonna call my bosses real quick. Chuck, the record company got you this phone, right? Sure. Hmm... okay. Why... I'll get you a new one. Chuck... in case you haven't noticed yet, I just asked you to party... with me. Come on. Come on. Yeah. What a night. You got money, right? 'Cause I don't hold cash. First, a little liquid nourishment. Then, we'll get on to the heavy drinking. Oh, um, you know, I'm actually more of a beer guy. Something amber complected? Not tonight, Chuck. I may be a rum-soaked narcissist, but I am also the best wingman you will ever have. Drink it down, mate. See you guys in the emergency room! Hello. Gavin, you old slapper. No, I'm with the rep from the label. Chuck! Never heard of you. I've never heard of  him. He's never heard of you! No, never mind. See you later. Who's for another drink? Ladies, tonight, all the drinks... on the record company. Oh! To determine who will be the plus one of my golden ticket, we will settle this with Morgan's special triathlon. First up... the Molly Ringwald underpants challenge. The first of you to present to me women's underpants is going to... I'm a man. For God's sake, I'm a man! Oh. I'm actually going to accept these. You know, a ticket's not that important to me. I need some ice. Look, if you're worried about Chuck, I can talk to him, scare him straight. I'd actually enjoy that. Uh, no, it's okay. I'll get him under control. Too late. So I said, "I'll give you  the dog for the trousers. " That's how I got the trousers. Hey, Chuck. I'll tell you what you need. Aspirin! A tattoo. Oh, no, no, no! I'm not crazy about needles. Ladies love a little bit of ink. Whenever I do something amazing, you know, feed the starving, help the homeless, rescue some emaciated refugee, I map it out here on my body. How do you know what they all mean? Well, this here means... serenity. It's not... it could be bliss. I don't know-- Gavin, my manager, sorts it all out. You know, you got to kind of trust the artist. Are you Tyler Martin? Yes, I am. And this here is Chuck. Chuck is in my band. Yeah... yeah, I'm in his band all right. Drummer-- just laying the beats down. Like a little drummer boy. Come, they told me. Pa-rump-a-pum-pum. Um... you guys want to dance? Yes. No. Yes, we do. No, I'm not really a dancer, you know? Unless it's, like, some ballet or... but this isn't a ballet place. You know, I'm much better at ironic dancing. What happened to your accent? Sorry. I don't really have one. I don't really care. Round two. The Subway sprint. There's only one thing you got to ask yourself, Butterman. Do you like succulent chicken oozing with bacon and ranch dressing? I love succulent chicken. I am in your head, sir. Let's use this, use this-- are you ready? Set. Consume. Oh, keep it down or you're disqualified. Keep it... Keep it... down. Attaboy-- get to work. Come on, come on. We have a winner. Winner! Winner. The signal is weak,   but I still have a trace on Chuck. He's somewhere in the club. Casey, it's him. Damn it, he made me. Go. Freeze! Halt! Get on the ground. You'll want to be more gentle with me. Get your hands up... do it! I'm going to walk away from you now. I'd rather we all go up. Casey, be careful. Then, you should know that Mr. Martin is still in danger. I have some friends set to meet him. So, by all means, stay here and die. Or you can go save him. Casey. We gotta get Chuck-- come on. 
 
 Chuck! We got a problem. These girls want to take us upstairs and do despicable things to us. Tyler, Tyler, that's... that's not such a great idea. All the best nights of my life have begun with that very sentence. Which brings us to the final leg of our triathlon. Good lord, is that... Yeah, Butterman, it is. May I present to you the urinal cake. Okay, here's the deal. The winner will be the first one of you... Ah, come on. That's disgusting. Dude, seriously, are you kidding me? What is wrong with you? You were just supposed to touch it. I still win, right? All right, who stole the urinal cakes? I splashed myself silly. Welcome to Castle de Orlando, Spanish conquistador. So, I think we should maybe just head... Tyler, Tyler, I need to talk to you, buddy. In a minute, Charles. No, no, it's very important. I need to talk to you right now. Ladies, I'm so sorry. If you just go make yourself comfortable right inside, then maybe we could have our talk, and then we'll join you in just a second. How does that sound? What? Thanks so much. Listen to me very carefully, Tyler. These women are very, very dangerous. Don't worry. I always use protection. Good looking out. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm begging you, just once, deny yourself this pleasure. You're right. That's totally selfish of me. Oh, good, lets go. You need this much more than I do. No, no, Ty, no, I'm not talking about... Please don't, please... Hey. I'm... Where's Tyler? That's an excellent question. T-Tyler, Tyler just-- he stepped away for a second, but he's gonna be right back, I promise. I guess you'll have to go first. Go first where, go first what? Why-- where am I going first? Why do I have to be first? First is the worst, second is the best, and third... ! Oh, h-hi. Oh... Those are my shoes; I need those. I need those shoes, I need those shoes. I need those-- no, those are my pants! I think that you have overestimated my prowess as, as, as a lover and a man. Just looking at you, I can feel that you require a... a real rock star, so... Tyler. What happened to not leaving your wingman? Sarah. Where are you? Top floor, Tyler's suite, or more specifically, the roof outside of it. Things have gotten a little out of hand. Aah! Aah! This is so romantic. The perfect second honeymoon. Could you push the button for the lobby, please? No, no, n-no, the lobby, the lobby! Where you going, where you going, where you going? No, lob-lobby! Don't... Ladies. Ladies, you ready for me? Tyler, run! Sorry, I must be going. Get 'em, Sarah! Lobby, please. Chuck, what were you thinking? You know, I gave you clear instructions to keep him here. And instead you take him to a nightclub? Interesting tactical decision there. Well, time-out, listen, he woke up and I couldn't stop him. Okay, I don't have a knockout karate chop like you guys. That's not part of my skill set. Where am I? And how was I? Mr. Martin, we're with the government. We're here to protect you. Wait, there was an elevator. Chuck, you were there. T-Two girls. One of them had a gun. I-It was pointed at me. Tyler, Tyler, it's all right. Just like Casey said, we're here to protect you. I need to call my manager. No, Mr. Martin, I don't think that's a good idea because we don't know who's involved. I have to call my manager. Good show. Casey, what is wrong with you? ! You can't do that! You're going to give the guy brain damage or liver problems. Too late on both counts. I know why they're trying to kill him. I know why they want him dead. What? His back, the tattoo on his back. It's not, it's not Arabic philosophy. It's actually a very clear message about a private reactor that's being built in North Africa. His manager is bringing in the tattoo artists. Of course. He's a rock star, he travels the world. Manager is using him to move secrets. Idiot never even knew what the ink meant. You know what, Casey? You're wrong about Tyler. He's actually a pretty good guy. He's an idiot, Bartowski, just like you. Should have never left the two of you alone. You know, Chuck, Casey is right. I mean, you could have gotten yourself killed. What exactly were you thinking? What was I thinking? I'll tell you what I was thinking. I was thinking like I wasn't a spy. Okay? I was trying to have a little bit of fun, and I knew the second I called you two, it would all be over. But Chuck, you  are  a spy, and you should know better than to put yourself in a dangerous situation where I can't protect you. Is it really so wrong for me to want a night off? I was having a really good time, too, until the assassins stole my pants and tried to kill me. I've earned it. I deserve it. I'm losing consciousness. Casey! My ears couldn't take it. Either that or I shoot him. You ready for a taste of the sweet life tonight, buddy? Yeah, sure, sure. Backstage passes. You know what that means, don't you? No, I've never been backstage before. That ticket's our passport to freedom. Not only is there free beer backstage, but there are women that haven't been sober for years, and we're allowed in, so the ladies assume we're not losers. Wow... it sounds like a fairy tale. Poor Butterman. The guy's been trapped in an 8x10 cell for years. He ate when they said "Chow time, " and he slept when they shouted "Lights out!" Now look at him. Broken. The man had a choice of five sodas, a choice we take for granted every day, a choice he's been denied for far too long. I'm sorry, Jeff, this ticket doesn't belong to us. This ticket belongs to Butterman. The man deserves his passport to freedom. You and I, we're going to give it to him. I'll make it up to you. I'll buy you a keg. What do you like? It's called Beer. Done... done. Beer brand. Your flash turned up good intel, Chuck. The man you confronted last night is Achmed Gambir, a top foot soldier in a private army in North Africa. We've been trying to infiltrate their ranks for years. I want you to capture Achmed at tonight's concert. He's the key to bringing down this merc army. What-- w-w-wait, wait, wait. You want Tyler onstage as bait? General, Mr. Martin knows there are people after him and he won't go on. Well, then convince him. Wait, no, no. No, no, guys, hey, this is way too dangerous. Tyler could get killed. Those are nightmares tattooed on his body, Chuck. We have to take Gambir down tonight. Okay, okay, fine, fine, you go in there and tell him he has to put his life on the line because he was a pawn in someone else's game. He won't listen to us. So you want me to do it? No, absolutely not. What do you mean no? We have orders. Chuck, what is the matter with you? This is about more than just taking a night off. Maybe. Um, I-- you know, I'm a little off my game right now. I'm not, not really sleeping. I don't want to get into it. Chuck, lives are on the line right now, and if Tyler doesn't help us, then he will never be free of those people, and if you don't help us, then Achmed Gambir gets away. And the world becomes a more dangerous place. I don't know what happened to you, but this is our job-- not only to protect Tyler but the country and anybody else who needs protecting. We do whatever it takes no matter what. Did you forget that? That I definitely didn't forget. We don't have time for this. Wait. I'll do it. I'll convince him. Hey, man. You okay? No. No, I'm not okay. Don't know where I am, how I got here, and someone's trying to kill me. On the plus side, your friend's tranqs are out of this world. Yeah, it's one of his few good qualities. I've never been in a situation like this before, life or death. Pretty much live my life avoiding anything this real. It takes some getting used to. What do you want me to do? We would like for you to perform tonight at your special concert. That's madness. People are trying to kill me. Yes, and you can help us catch them. You can help the world, the entire world, by doing this, for real. You could go back to living your life again. One night of bravery for an entire life of normalcy. I can't even tell you what I'd give for that. How do I know I can trust them? Your people? Because I do. They're the best. I stake my life on it every day. I got one thing to say. Hello, Cleveland. It's Burbank. Right. I'm dyslexic. You boys have given me back hope. Thanks. You deserve a taste of the sweet life, man. Enjoy it for all of us. Do us proud, Butterman. Thanks. There you go. Dude, how could you just sell the golden ticket like that? Sorry, guys. I found out how much these things are going for online. But your freedom, man. Was it worth the price of freedom? Price of my freedom is 800 bucks. Same as my ticket to Zihuatanejo. See you never. Enjoy hell. Get busy living, or get busy dying. True that. Well, back to work. 20 minutes till Tyler Martin takes the stage. Chuck. Yeah, I'm here. Don't let Tyler take the stage till we give the okay. Okay. Got it. Sarah, made the mark. Get on my six and intercept him. Who are you? Why you wearing this? Some guy gave me free tickets. He just said I had to wear this stupid jacket. He's ahead of us. Which one is he? Sorry, buddy, No one allowed to see Mr. Martin. Oh. Ha, ha. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Let me get that. Yeah, you get it, Chuck. Open this door. It's him. It's him. Who? The guy who's trying to kill you? Here? I thought you said we were safe. I know you're in there, Mr. Martin. Oh, I need another drink. That's a good idea. No, that's-- no. No. Hey, get in there. Get in there. I said open this door! What about you, Chuck? I'll be all right. Just, just stay in the closet. Wait. Take off your shirt. Just trust me. Hey. Sarah, it's Chuck. Chuck. What is it? Achmed. Achmed's right outside the dressing room. I-I don't know what happened to the guards. Okay, Chuck, stay right where you are. I'm coming. Sarah, look, I didn't need the night off. You were right, it's something else. I should've told you. I should have... . Chuck? Chuck, can you hear me? Move. Excuse me. Go! I think maybe, maybe you have the wrong room. Tell me where he is? Tell you where who is? Oh! Oh, where-where he is-- where Tyler is. Right. He, you know, he-- he skipped out. I don't know where he is. So sorry. I don't know. He's gone. He's in the closet. Excuse me. Move! Coming through. Move. Okay, you got us. Yeah, worse plan ever. But I know about the tattoo. I know what it means. You and your private army enriching uranium, selling it to unstable countries. Using Tyler's manager and his tattoos to pass the info off to your buyers. You take one more step, I send this e-mail and everyone knows. Proving that the cell is mightier than the sword. Or, or a very large knife, as it might be in this case. Go! Excuse me. Move! Put it down. Put it down! No! No! I can't let you do this for me Chuck. Actually, my plan was working very well. No! No! Follow me. Tyler, what's going on, man? Gavin, you're fired! Sarah, we're running to the stage. He's right behind us. Chuck, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, just get us out of here. Tyler! Tyler! Tyler! Everybody give it up for Tyler Martin! Hey! Whoo! Help. Wow! Los Angeles. What do we do now? Jump. What? Jump. Chuck! Jump! It's all good, it's all good, Chuck, relax. Come on, take it easy. Okay, okay. Stephanie, right? Stephanie. Yeah! You think I look mad, wait till you see her. Hey. A little too much to drink there, huh, pal? Uh, let's get you some coffee. We got him! Ha, ha, ha! See? I told you they were the best! Yeah, that's it, all right. Now back to the stage. Come on, I want to sing now. All right, like he said, back to the stage. Who the hell are you? Grimes? Where's my boy Butterman? Um, he kind of took off suddenly. Can't say I blame him. Man's gotta run free after being locked up so long. Yeah, yeah, well, um, Big Mike, do mind if I ask you what Butterman was in the can for? I mean, you talking robbery? Drugs? Murder? Butterman? Yeah. God, no! Bank fraud, insider trading. The man's a white-collar criminal. Why? He take you fools for some money? He said he was going somewhere. Zihuatanejo? That's Mexican for Philadelphia. I knew I should have learned Spanish. I can't believe my manager's going to jail. Think about it. No privacy. It'd be like hell on bloody earth. Yeah. Tell me about it. You understand why you're gonna have to get your tattoos removed, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. I hear you're the bro to talk to to get more of those tasty tranq darts. Philistine. Thanks, Chuck. Oh, hey, it was nothing. No, no, it was everything. You taught me to put people in front of myself. Felt kind of wonderful. I can strike that off the list now. If you ever want to party, you know where to come. Yeah, actually, I don't think that's my scene. Smart man, Chuck. Smart man. All right. All right. Take it easy. You, too. Hello, Mr. Martin. Oh. Your limousine is waiting outside. You know my name. Have we made love before? No. Daddy's got to go. Sorry. Later. You did a great job, Chuck. Thanks. Look, if-if there's something bothering you, then please tell me. I know part of your job is to have all these secrets in your head, but you're not supposed to keep them from me. I know. I know. I saw you shoot that FULCRUM agent on Christmas Eve after they took over the Buy More. And when I asked you about it... I lied. Yeah. Chuck, I have to protect you. I know that. I, I... I know that you do. And you were protecting me. You were protecting all of us. He had threatened my family, my friends, and you were just doing your job-- I get that, but... Sarah, the guy was unarmed and, and you just... I did what I had to. He knew who you really were. Your whole family was in danger. And I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget that you never asked for all of this. There's parts I'm not sure I'll ever get used to. Well, you deserve a break. So, take tonight, tomorrow-- whatever you need, it's yours. Seriously? Really? Yeah, no missions, no cameras, no Casey, no thermal satellite surveillance and no me. You guys use satellites? Yeah. Oh. And Chuck, when you're ready again, we'll be here, waiting. Hey, what's this? What's going on? Lock and load. A new mission. We'll see you tomorrow. Wait, a new, a new mission? What kind of mission? It's fine, Chuck. We've got it. What, what kind of mission? Ah, finally, a mission without Bartowski. I'm going to enjoy this. Okay, guys. Where are we going? Well, come on, Casey. No time for a break, we've got work to do.
