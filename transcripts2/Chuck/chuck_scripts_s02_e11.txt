 ♪ ♪ 
 Sweet wheels. 
 Right back at you, dawg. 
 Love the smell of day before Christmas in the morning. 
 There's just nothing quite like the sweet scent of desperate last-minute shoppers in the air. 
 You jack our prices up 10%? 
 15. You snooze, you lose. 
 We're going to rob them blind. 
 Merry Christmas! 
 Merry Christmas! 
 (both laughing) 
 Hey, sure is quiet around here. 
 Bad guys taking a holiday too? 
 Not that I mind, by the way, because the Intersect could certainly use some down time as well. 
 Speaking of which, we have a cover date tomorrow. 
 Christmas at the Bartowskis. 
 Oh, uh, thanks for the invitation, Chuck, but I don't do Christmas. 
 (chuckling) 
 I'm sorry. 
 I think you just said you don't do Christmas? 
 Look, I would rather not get into it. 
 But it-it's Christmas! 
 Look, I'm not buying the whole Scrooge act, okay. 
 Underneath that spy cover is a regular person just like the rest of us. 
 I mean, honestly, how weird could Christmas have been for you? 
 Christmas at the Burton household meant the annual Salvation Army con job. 
 Okay, well, it's, uh... okay, you're a little different than the rest of us. 
 But Christmas at the Bartowskis means eggnog, PJs, a fake gas fireplace  and that's right-- Twilight Zone marathons. 
 I'm not taking no for an answer, Walker, so prepare to be heart-warmed. 
 Oh, thank God you're here, Chuck, thank God. 
 Anna won't speak to me, you know, after I balked at the whole moving in together thing. 
 She thinks you're immature. 
 Afraid to grow up and be an adult. 
 Exactly. Yeah, exactly, and that's ridiculous! 
 Do I not look like an adult to you? 
 Tv Announcer : Well, it's been about a half hour now, and the chase continues through the Valley. 
 Lester : 20 large says this thing ends with the pigs making that punk eat lead. Thoughts? 
 Anna : I say he crashes and we end up with a stand-off, maybe hostages. 
 Never going to happen. 
 Please, you guys are amateurs. 
 This has "beatdown" written all over it. 
 Lester : Okay, bring it in then. Bring it in, everybody. Bring it in. 
 Well, it's nice to see everyone's in the Christmas spirit this morning. 
 This is how we roll... 
 Big Mike : Bartowski! 
 Door's open in an hour. 
 Round up the freaks, have everyone meet me at Santa's village. Pronto! 
 This is it, people. 
 D-day. 
 You ready for war? 
 You got what it takes? ! 
 Take a sniff, Grimes! 
 Tell this band of misfits what you smell. 
 Absolutely, uh, coffee? Hazelnut, maybe? 
 A... glazed bear claw, (sniffing) cream-filled perhaps, sir? 
 I'm not talking about my breakfast! 
 I'm talking about profits! 
 People are lazy. 
 They'll be looking to purchase last-minute gifts which is why we raised our prices 15%. 
 We're looking at a record sales day, long as you people don't screw it up. 
 So, don't! 
 Hey, thank you. 
 Hey, what's going on? 
 We, uh, we decided we'd beat the rush and take advantage of the friends and family discount. 
 Oh, don't worry about getting me a gift, babe. 
 You already did. 
 I did? 
 Yeah, I took it upon myself since you never know what to get me. 
 Well, that's great. What'd I get you? 
 Weekend sky diving trip with the boys in Crested Butte. 
 10, 000 foot free-fall. 
 Awesome! 
 Big Mike : Bartowski! Santa's Village. 
 Uh, yeah. Hey, great. 
 I got to get back to work. You kids have fun. 
 Great, so, um, my gift to my fiancé is a ticket to death. 
 Babe, it's completely safe. 
 Besides, I need the adrenaline rush, a little sense of danger in my life. 
 (scoffs) 
 What? 
 Tv Announcer : Okay, the suspect has just gotten off the 5 Freeway and right now is making his way through Burbank. 
 Oh, man. The cops looked pissed! 
 I'm so winning the pool. 
 Christmas sucks. 
 Tv Reporter : Action News reporting, as police continue their high-speed chase through downtown Burbank. 
 If anything, he appears to be picking up speed in this residential neighborhood. 
 Now, folks, we'd like to warn anyone in the area this is obviously an extremely dangerous situation. 
 Wait a minute; it appears the perpetrator has just... (sirens blaring) turned off Burbank Boulevard into a shopping complex. 
 (sirens blaring) 
 He's not slowing down. He's not slowing down! 
 (yelling) 
 (screaming) 
 Tv Announcer : Wow, it's unbelievable. 
 We'll continue to keep you updated... 
 All right, nobody move! 
 Pay up, suckers! 
 Hi... 
 Welcome to the Buy More. 
 And Merry Christmas. 
 (tires screeching)

 (sirens blaring) 
 Not good... 
 Not good. Oh, boy. 
 Okay, Ned. Just calm down. 
 Ned : Think, think, think. 
 Hi, Hi. 
 Uh, my name is Nathan Edward Rhyerson. 
 Uh, people like to call me Ned. 
 I'm sorry about the entrance. 
 Could someone please tell me who's in charge here? 
 All : Chuck! 
 Actually, I'm not technically in charge. 
 I don't want to hurt anyone, Chuck. 
 So, as long as no one gets brave, no one gets shot, okay? ! 
 Okay. 
 I think we're safe. Yeah. 
 Um, this store has a very strict "no bravery policy. " 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Everyone, uh, get over there by the Santa's Village. 
 Now! Come on! 
 Uh, Chuck? 
 Where's the security system? 
 It, um... just follow me. 
 Right over here. 
 Are there any other ways in and out of the store? 
 Um, yeah. 
 But they're all locked down because we technically haven't opened yet. 
 Good. 
 Lock it down. 
 What's going on? 
 Great, I step out of work one time and I miss all the fun. 
 The suspect's name is Nathan Rhyerson. 
 He is a civilian. No record. 
 Not even a speeding ticket in the past ten years. 
 Well, Nathan picked himself the wrong place to be naughty instead of nice. 
 Now, I get to play with my new toy I got myself for Christmas. 
 General, if we go in guns blazing, Chuck's cover will be blown. 
 The guy seems pretty timid, not someone the local PD couldn't handle. 
 What are you saying, Agent Walker? 
 I'm saying that Chuck has family and friends in there, and if we blow Chuck's cover, then not only he will have to go underground, but so will everyone else. 
 We'll try it Agent Walker's way first. 
 Slip into the Buy More from Castle and see if you can remove Chuck without calling attention to yourselves or the assets. 
 Understood? 
 Understood. 
 Are you okay, Major? 
 Hmm? 
 Oh, uh, just paper cuts. 
 I'm on gift wrap station right now, General. 
 It's an electronic store, Major. 
 Not Basra. 
 Get it under control. 
 This is Maureen Mitsubishi, KPFW News, reporting from the Burbank Buy More, where some unlucky employees are spending the day before Christmas with an armed gunman instead of their loved ones. 
 Who's in charge here? 
 Well, I am, sir. Al Powell. Burbank PD. 
 Who are you? 
 Lieutenant Mauser. Hostage negotiator, LAPD. 
 So, what's it look like in there? 
 Well, all indications are everybody is safe. 
 This guy is an amateur. 
 Good news is that my cousin, Mike, is the store manager. 
 And if I know Mike, he'll have everything under control. 
 Hmm. 
 Big Mike : Why today? 
 You know how much money I'm losing? 
 All of our shoppers are going to go to Large Mart. 
 There, there, big man. Just eat. 
 It's going to be okay. 
 It is? 
 Yes, it is. 
 Every news outlet is out there. 
 Any publicity is good publicity. 
 Yeah. 
 Besides, my cousin, Big Al, is a cop. 
 Half of LAPD'll be here. 
 We can get this store back open for business by lunch, right? 
 Hmm, maybe. 
 Hey... Hey, Ned. It's Chuck. 
 That's a terrible picture of me. 
 Hey, you can put your hands down. 
 You know, the truth is I'm really not a bad guy once you get to know me. 
 When you're not crashing your car into electronics stores and waving a gun around? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, I know it's no excuse, but I lost my job, man. 
 All I wanted was to get a few gifts for my kids so we could celebrate Christmas. 
 And the next thing you know, I'm the next OJ. 
 What am I going to do, Chuck? 
 I mean, they're going to put me in jail, aren't they? 
 No, no, maybe not. 
 Maybe not, you know, uh... 
 I mean, you haven't hurt anyone yet, right? 
 So, maybe if you give up, they'll work out some sort of deal. 
 Probation or something. 
 W-Why would they do that? 
 Look, keep this between us, but... I know some people. 
 You know, people who could make all this go away as long as you don't do anything stupid. 
 Like who? 
 (phone ringing) 
 Who's calling? 
 Uh, that's probably the police. 
 Maybe they want to know what's happening. 
 I don't want to talk to anyone. 
 Do you think you could answer it? 
 Yeah. (ringing) 
 Nerd Herd. How can I help you? 
 This is Lieutenant Mauser. LAPD. 
 Who am I speaking with? 
 This is Chuck Bartowski. Nerd Herd supervisor. 
 All right, Chuck, I'm going to need to talk to Ned. 
 He wants to talk to you. 
 He doesn't want to talk to you. 
 Okay, then you and I are going to have to work through this ourselves. 
 So tell me, is there anyone hurt in there? 
 No, nobody's hurt. 
 Everybody's okay. 
 Uh, Ned... is it okay if I call you Ned? 
 Sure, Ned's fine. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, Ned explicitly told me that he wants absolutely no trouble. 
 Tell him to send out a hostage as a sign of good faith. 
 He says that you should send out a hostage as a sign of good faith. 
 Emmett : Good God, pick me! 
 Pick me! Pick me! Pick me! Pick me! Pick me! 
 Pick me... 
 My 86-year-old mother is dying of a very rare disease. 
 It's leukoplakia. 
 And she needs me... her bobo. 
 Uh... okay, fine. 
 Send him. 
 Oh, thank you... thank you! 
 (sobbing) 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Oh, thank you. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 We're sending someone out. 
 We got one hostage coming out, folks. 
 That scoundrel. 
 I bet Bartowski worked out a deal. 
 Yeah, Chuck let Emmett go so he could get better lunch shifts. 
 Lester : That b*st*rd's selling us down the river, making a sweetheart deal for himself. 
 I guess it's prison rules now. 
 Every man for himself. 
 (gasps) 
 Oh, my... 
 Who's got a phone? Who's got a phone? 
 I need to call my lawyer. I need to call my therapist. 
 I need to call my mother, and I need to call my yogi. 
 Maureen Mitsubishi continuing to cover the story at the Burbank Buy More, where it seems a hostage has just been released. 
 I'm Lieutenant Mauser, LAPD. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Assistant Manager Emmett Milbarge. 
 That's two "T"s, two "M"s. 
 Tell me, Emmett. What's going on inside there? 
 What's going on inside is the greatest sales event of the season. 
 That's right. 
 We have got the best deals in town on all your electronic needs. 
 Mauser : No, no, Emmett, I meant the perp. 
 Is he dangerous? 
 EMMETT (laughing): Dangerous? 
 The only thing dangerous is how low we have slashed our prices. 
 God bless that man. 
 Uh, so, uh... 
 Hey, uh, Chuck, where are these people that can get me out of this? 
 Um... 
 They're uh, they're closer than you think. 
 Can I use the bathroom? 
 I mean, the store is already locked down, so I can't really go anywhere. 
 Yeah. 
 Sure, of course. 
 All right. 
 Be back in a sec. 
 It's about time the cavalry showed up. 
 So what's the plan? 
 The plan is to lock you in the Castle till this is over. 
 Come on... 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, whoa, whoa. 
 What about Ellie and Morgan and everyone else? 
 We're instructed to remove you and only you, Chuck. 
 There's a team coming to extract the rest, and they will be in good hands. 
 I'm not just going to leave my sister behind. 
 There are rules, Chuck, and we have to follow them. 
 So let's go... 
 I understand that there are rules, but when it comes to family and friends, there's a time to break 'em. Get in the hatch, Bartowski. 
 Chuck, you're letting your emotions cloud your judgment. 
 I promise nothing bad will happen to them. 
 Now please, come on. 
 I can't take that chance. 
 Ned : Chuck, is that you? 
 John, John. 
 (screaming) 
 No, no, no, Ned! 
 Chuck, what's going on? 
 Ned, Ned, please, please, please don't shoot that gun. 
 Who are they? 
 They're harmless. 
 They're harmless, okay? 
 Look, they heard your crash and they hid. 
 This is my girlfriend, Sarah. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 And this is John Casey, who's even more harmless than she is. 
 John Casey. 
 Ned, please, just uncock the gun. 
 Okay. 
 How do I do that? 
 'Cause the truth is, I never used one of these before. 
 There's probably a button on it, like a safety or something like that. 
 Just go ahead and push... 
 No, no, no! 
 (gunshot) Oh, my God. Chuck! 
 We have gunfire. 
 I repeat: we hear gunfire. 
 Ned : Oh! Oh! Oh! 
 Casey : My foot! 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. Are you okay? 
 I didn't mean to shoot you, I promise. 
 We need a SWAT team down here pronto. 
 Chuck : It's okay, everyone. 
 It was a mistake. 
 An accidental shooting. 
 But Casey is going to be just fine. 
 You idiot. You owe me a toe, Bartowski. 
 (nervous chuckle) 
 You're gonna be okay, John. 
 A lot of people get by with nine toes. 
 I'm getting by fine with eight. 
 How much do you think a toe is worth to Casey? 
 Why? 
 Maybe there's a finder's fee. 
 You know, I survived three wars without so much as losing a fingernail before I met you, Bartowski. 
 Look, I'm really sorry about your toe, John, but I had the situation under control. 
 You're the one who scared him. 
 You okay? 
 I'm just scared. 
 I've never been this close to a gun before. 
 Yeah, me, neither. 
 You know what? We'll... we'll be okay. 
 We just have to stick together. 
 Big Mike, Morgan, Jeff, Lester, come here. 
 Get over here. 
 I don't know about you guys, but I've had enough. 
 This guy is dangerous. 
 We need to take him out before anyone else gets hurt. 
 He's right. 
 The store closes at midnight. 
 We got lots of merchandise to move. 
 Fellas, I don't know. 
 Time to be a man, Morgan. 
 Yeah, you know, I'll do it. 
 I'm in. I'm in. 
 So am I. 
 Chuck : Wait. Hold on. 
 This is a very, very bad idea, okay? 
 Ned shot Casey on accident. 
 He's not trying to hurt anybody. 
 We need to let the police handle this. 
 Chuck's right. Let the cops handle this. 
 I know you guys work at a Buy More, but I'm a doctor. 
 Okay, I take risks every day. 
 This is a matter of life or death. 
 Someone needs to man up and take action. 
 Someone needs to be a hero. 
 No, they don't, Devon. 
 Being a hero is being alive to take care of your friends and family. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Ned : Chuck. 
 Chuck, they keep calling. 
 You better answer it. 
 Chuck : Yeah, coming right now. 
 Don't do anything. 
 Do nothing. I will be right back. 
 
 
 
 Hey, hey, I, uh... I feel terrible about shooting your friend's toe off. 
 No, no, no, no, that's okay. 
 Sometimes, I feel like shooting him myself. 
 This is Chuck. 
 Okay, okay, talk to me, Chuck. 
 We heard gunfire. 
 What's going on in there? 
 Everything's under control. 
 Everything is-is just fine. 
 There was an accidental shot fired and someone lost the majority of their toe, but besides that, everything's okay. 
 (growls) 
 Mauser : Put him on the phone. I want to talk to him now. He wants to talk to you. Huh? Well, ask him what he wants. I want to know what his demands are. He wants to know what your demands are. Well, I don't know. Uh, I have to think about it. Can you call back in, like, five minutes? Yeah, yeah. So, uh... so what are you gonna do, Ned? Well, maybe I should call my wife. She always knows what to do in these situations. Yeah, that-that's a great idea. Maybe you could let everyone else make a call, too, check in with their loved ones, let them know that they're safe. Okay, Chuck. Yeah. (beeping) Hey, honey, it's me. Uh... well, I'm okay. Look, uh, I know this is gonna sound bad... Hey, Mom and Dad. Hi, guys. Yeah, everything is awesome. Well, not really, but we'll be okay. Woman : Hi, there. You've reached the Love Chat Line. Looking to chat with someone special? Press 1. Man : Lompoc Correctional Institute. Yes, I'd like to speak to prisoner 27318, aka Mom. Hey, baby. Save your breath, Morgan. Powell : Hey, Big Mike. How you holding up in there, partner? Surviving, partner. Any shoppers lining up out there? Mother? Johnny Boy. Yeah, I'm okay, uh... (phone ringing) Hi, Chuck. Where are you? DVDs. I'm in the romantic comedy section, although, for irony's sake, I suppose I should probably be in hostage thrillers. So, uh, Ned let everyone call their loved ones. That was pretty smart to call me. Protect our cover. Yeah, well, you are my girlfriend. Sort of. So, does that mean your offer still stands for Christmas? See, I knew you could be heart-warmed. (chuckling) I actually, um... I have something for you. I was gonna give it to you tomorrow, but considering the circumstances, I kind of want to give it to you today. Chuck, we're gonna get out of here. We'll be fine, I... promise. Wow. (chuckles) It's beautiful. It's good luck. It was my mom's charm bracelet. My dad gave it to her when Ellie was born. Oh, Chuck, I can't take this. This is something real, something that you should give to a real girlfriend. I know. (phone ringing) Chuck. Duty calls. (phone continues ringing) Hey, this is Chuck. Chuck, what does he want? This is Lieutenant Mauser. He wants to know what you want. I want to go home and spend Christmas with my family. All right. Tell him I'm coming in, Chuck. I'm unarmed. I just want to talk so we can get him and everybody else home for Christmas. Okay. Okay, all right, yeah, I'm-I'm gonna come open the door right now. (beeping) (door slams) I'm completely unarmed, Ned. Just want a little face time so we can talk this out. Chuck, you come back over here. Okay, I don't want to go to jail. It's okay. We're gonna work on that. But in the meantime, what do you say you and I make a trade, okay? Me for two of your hostages. It'd make a lot of people out there feel a whole lot easier. Yeah, in here, too. Okay, okay, two people can go. Okay, good, good. Um, what do you say we start with the injured man? He looks like he needs medical attention. I'm fine. Good. Let Ellie go. No, no, Casey, thank you, but you need to go. Your toe could be infected. Chuck, you've been a good friend to me, so I'm gonna return the favor. I'm gonna let your girlfriend go. No! Chuck? Ouch. Yikes. It'll be a cold Christmas at the Bartowskis. Oh, no, he didn't. I didn't. I don't... I don't mean I don't want my girlfriend to leave because clearly, I would really like for Sarah to leave and be out of harm's way. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying... what I'm saying is that... I'm not your only friend here, Ned, you've endeared yourself into the hearts of everyone here. I think we're all friends. This is a... we're a family. We've gonna through a lot, haven't we? So we should all leave. Why don't we all leave together? No, just those two. Okay! (grunts) (hushed): Our team just arrived. Don't do anything stupid. Maybe the rest of us can get out of here without losing an appendage. Uh, Chuck, it's okay. Trust me. I'll never let anyone hurt you. Okay. Good to finally meet you face-to-face, Chuck. Yeah. Did a hell of a job. Pretty impressive for a retail jockey. I just want all this over as soon as possible. So do I, Chuck. So do I. Hey, don't worry about it, buddy. I'm a pro. Everything's gonna be just fine, okay? Wait, wait, wait, wait! Chuck, look, you did a good job, but I'll take it from here, okay? Yeah, but-but you know what? Um, Ned is really uptight, so maybe, maybe I should go over there and talk to him and tell him that you're taking over. Kind of put him at ease so he doesn't get upset. So you guys developed a little trust, did you? Yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah, good idea. Good. Listen to me, Ned, you have to listen to me very carefully. This guy Mauser-- he is no good. He is not a good guy, okay? We cannot trust him. Why not? We have to let everybody out of the store right now. If I let everyone out, then I'm not gonna have any bargaining chips. I can't go to jail, Chuck. Okay, look, the people I was talking about-- the people that can help, they work for the government, see? They will do anything they can to protect me. That's the only bargaining chip that you need. Ned, you have to trust me. You need to let everyone go. I haven't let you down yet, have I? Thanks, Chuck. I'll take it from here. Okay, okay. Well, Ned... it's time the rubber hits the road. What do you say we make a deal? Hmm? Hey, no, look, no, no, that's okay; that's okay. You need medical attention, Major Casey. No, I'm fine. Let's end this. How's it look in there? Better. Ned seemed to calm down after he talked to his wife. Yeah, where is she? You didn't bring her down here. Wife? What wife? There's no record of Ned being married. He's right. There's no record of him being married. We saw him make a call. Trace it. See if we can find out who he was speaking to. (typing) Look, boys, this guy is tired and frazzled. I say we take him out. Anyone else play ball in college? Played some linebacker. I did not. I did a lot of Madden on the PlayStation 3. Does that count? Be bold, Morgan. All right, I'm in. All right. Listen up. It's called "The Picket Fence. " Big Mike and I will be the flanks, all right? Morgan, you're the sacrificial lamb. Jeff, Lester, you're coming up from behind. Why are we always coming up from behind? It seems awkward. I need everybody... Hey, hey, what are you doing? Well, we're taking this guy out. You in? No, and neither are you. This situation is way too dangerous. Please, Devon, if you love Ellie, don't do this. Okay, Chuck, you win. Chuck, can I talk to you a minute? (sighs) Remember: don't be awesome. Hey. Well, Chuck, it looks like Ned and I have worked the whole thing out. That's great! That's great! I'll just go tell everybody that we can leave. No, no, no, no, not just yet, but soon. First, you and I need to work something out on our own. I don't understand. You see, FULCRUM knows John Casey's NSA. The person he called is in the Buy More right now. The yogurt girl's CIA. Oh, my God. Chuck. We've lost enough agents to these two. We knew they were here protecting someone. We just didn't know who. So we caused a little ruckus, sent Ned inside to see who they would rush to protect. Turns out... they're protecting you. (both chuckle) I have no idea what you're talking about, Lieutenant. Do you see, uh, Ned over there? I'd hate to see him shoot your pretty little sister if he thought you were not cooperating with me. Look, I'm, I'm just an analyst, okay? Please don't hurt anyone. Chuck, you're way more than just an analyst. We did a background check on you. Turns out you were college roommates with Bryce Larkin. The same Bryce Larkin that stole the Intersect from us. Bryce Larkin is dead. And I'm done negotiating. (cocks gun) Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop him. Stop him. Please stop him. What do you want? I want to know where Bryce Larkin and the Intersect is. And if I think you're lying even a little bit, your sister dies. Where's Bryce Larkin? I don't know. Then I'm really sorry. But I know where the Intersect is. Where? It's right here. All right, Chuck, this is how it's gonna play out. Ned's gonna release another hostage: you. Then you and I are gonna go out and get into an ambulance, which will take you to a secure FULCRUM facility, where you'll stay. I'm never gonna see my sister again, am I? No. Well, then would you mind if I said good-bye to her, please? Okay. But if you say or do anything to call attention to me or your situation, Ned's gonna shoot her,  capisce? Yeah. Okay, good. Go ahead. They're letting me go. Oh, thank God. Good-bye, Ellie. You know how much I love you, right? Hey! Hey, cheer up. It'll be okay. You're acting like you're never going to see me again. It's okay. See you in a bit, Chuck. Listen, there's a time to be brave and a time to be timid. This is a time to be brave. Do it. Right on, bro. Woman : Sir! Sir, over here! Can we get a statement, sir? Maureen Mitsubishi back at the Buy More where, apparently, another hostage has just been released. We're not sure of his identity, but he does appear to be unharmed. FULCRUM's got Chuck. Everybody ready? Yeah. Hands in. Break. I hope they're not doing anything risky. Morgan's with them. Trust me. You've got nothing to worry about. They're getting away with Chuck. Hey, get back here! He's breathing. He's fine. That was really stupid, Devon. At least he's not afraid to take a risk like Morgan. Finally, this is getting interesting. Okay, who's next? You? What the... ? (groaning) Oh! Man, did you see that? Anna : Lester? Are you okay? That was so brave. Well, in times of crisis, a man... needs to step up. You know, be a man, I think they say. ♪ ♪ (muffled grunting, panting) Lieutenant Mauser's FULCRUM. So's Ned... it was all a set-up. I know. Everyone in the store is still in danger. Our team is moving in on them right now; they'll be fine. Now I need you to run back as fast as you can to the Castle. I can't leave you alone with this guy. Your safety is more important than mine. Now leave and don't turn back. Go. Go. ♪ ♪ (twig snaps) (chuckling) (grunting) (groans) You may have beaten me, Agent Walker, but FULCRUM's won. I know Chuck Bartowski's the Intersect. Chuck's secret is safe. And you're going straight to a CIA detention facility, never to be seen or heard from again. You go right ahead, Agent Walker. Arrest me. But say "good-bye" to Chuck. I'm not like those other FULCRUM agents. They'll do whatever it takes to find me. And when they do, every FULCRUM agent we have is going to know Chuck's the Intersect. It's going to be the end of his pathetic existence. So take me in, Agent Walker. Ready to go. (silenced gunshot) Oh, God... ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Hey, how are you doing? Okay. I thought I was about to lose you there for a minute. It was hell, but I survived. Hey, you hungry? I could eat. ♪ ♪ Ellie. I thought you'd like to know that I cancelled my skydiving trip. Are you sure? I thought you needed more excitement. I've had all the excitement I need, honey. Thanks. For what? Staying with me. I would've been alone tonight. Hmm, me, too. Anna? Gross! (chuckling) Chuck! It's okay. You're safe. I got the FULCRUM agent. What happened to him? I arrested him. Casey's taking him to a secure facility as we speak. It's okay. He's going to go to jail. He'll never bother you again. Merry Christmas, guys. Merry Christmas. Ellie : Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Chuck. It's not going to be one we're going to forget soon, huh? Uh, yeah. Oh, that looks fantastic on you. Oh, thank you. I'm so glad that you have it. Yeah, me, too. Let me ask you something. What do you do when you see your girlfriend do something so horrific, it's permanently burned into your brain? I don't know, buddy. But I know exactly what you mean.
