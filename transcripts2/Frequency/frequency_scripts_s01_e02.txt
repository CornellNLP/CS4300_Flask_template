 My name is Detective Raimy Sullivan. 
 My father was killed in 1996. 
 Last night... 
 WQ2YV, is... 
 Hello? 
 Hey. 
 I spoke to him. 
 Your father? 
 Dad? 
 So you're telling me that in 20 years I'm gonna be on the job with my daughter? 
 No. You die tomorrow. 
 [gasps] 
 Dad survived, but saving his life changed everything. 
 We've ID'd the remains from the marsh. 
 I'm sorry, Raimy, it's your mom. 
 The most wanted serial killer in New York took my mom. 
 Now, whatever we do, however we try and fix things, history keeps changing. Your name is Daniel Lawrence. How do you know my name? I'm your girlfriend.

I can stop there, Detective. Are you finished? No, I just thought... Go on. I'm on the Nightingale Task Force. If it's Nightingale, I need to know everything. Of course. And then there, the broken hyoid clearly indicates manual strangulation, which, again, is consistent with the Nightingale and what we've determined to be the ultimate cause of death. She's not dead yet. ♪ ♪ Uh, these are the only personal effects found with your mother's body. [dramatic music] She's not dead yet. ♪ ♪ Something happened. You lived, but Mom died.

He hasn't been caught? In the world when you died, he stopped. But then you lived, and he's killed at least 20 more. How can you know this? Because I remember it both ways. Life when you died and life when you didn't. Trust me, I know that sounds crazy,  but everything I had, everything I lost when history changed, I remember. When does he take her? January 10, 1997. What's that? It's 11... 11 weeks... 11 weeks from... from right now? Which means we have a date and a suspect. We could stop him. We... we can find him,  and we can stop him. ♪ ♪ Dad? Yeah.

But I don't want you to regret not giving her a proper good-bye. And I'd really like to focus on finding the b*st*rd who did this to her. All right. Thank you. [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ He's not creepy. He's South African. He's an architect. Who was your patient in the ER, Ma. It's creepy on so many levels. All I'm saying is meet him. What's his name?

In recognition for his service, today, Detective Sullivan received the Combat... [exhales] You know... [sighs] you should really try smiling, Sullivan. There's a party going on. [scoffs] [chuckles] Look, man, forget that hero nonsense. You're home now. That's what you wanted, right? I heard the Task Force needs bodies. The Nightingale Task Force? Yeah, we do, but we can wait. Frank, you've been undercover for two years. You can take a week. [chuckles] And New York needs more heroes like Detective Frank Sullivan. [soft music] ♪ ♪ Hey, Raims. Look at you. Have you ever tried meteor scatter? Uh... I'm sorry, what now? You know, how to bounce signals off the moon, right? You can do the same thing with meteor trails. Come on. Where'd you learn that? The library. Want me to show you? Yeah. [laughs] ♪ ♪ Did you talk to the lady on the ham? I did. She was nice. Yeah, well, she has her issues, but, yeah, she is, isn't she?

You don't have to thank me. No, really, I didn't... I didn't mean to just land here. You know? I-I know that we got a lot to discuss. I know I've caused you and Raims all kinds of pain, and it...

You know that the Nightingale Killers still out there, right? I mean, this is the safest place you can be. Thank you, Frank, because I needed to be more freaked. He's killing nurses. They think. I mean, what, there's been two? I need to know that you're taking this seriously. I am. Of course I am. I just... I can't be all cop talk all of the...

♪ Everyday is a faded sign ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Hey, are you okay? I'm fine. My friends are in the bar. Here, let me help you. [suspenseful music] That marsh where my mother was found, I did some digging. Please tell me you went home last night. There was a sexual assault case in the same marsh in 1994. Two years before my mom was abducted. And what, you think they're linked? That marsh is out of the way. You gotta know it's there to know it's there. Okay, so maybe he liked the scenery in '94, then decided to use it as a dumping ground two years later? What's the file say? There is no file. The charges were dropped. The case was expunged. I found an article in some newspaper archives. So who's our guy? Thomas Goff. College student, early 20s. And now? Investment banker, two kids, lives in Jersey. Whoa... This is our Nightingale?

These things are a bitch, right? Just relax. Everything'll be fine. October 22, 1996. In your capacity as an undercover Narcotics officer, you were involved in a gunfight with up to four individuals from a suspected criminal gang, were you not? That's correct. You've previously described this encounter as a sting operation gone bad. Is that correct. Exactly. Let's park ourselves right there for a sec. Let's talk a moment off the record, Detective. Okay. We've already interviewed Stan Moreno as well as the other men in his direct command. To a man they testified there was no sting that night, nor were you led to believe there was. There's no records. There's nothing in the log books. Which means it's your word against the word of three decorated cops. [soft dramatic music] I mean, you're Captain freaking America in this town right now, Frank.

You're talking about something that happened 20 years ago. A youthful indiscretion. Is that how you would describe what happened in that marsh? I don't wanna be a roadblock here, Detective. I really don't. But if you know the case, you know it was expunged. Doesn't that tell you everything you need to know? Ask Lisa. She'll say the same thing. Lisa Boyle, the woman who filed the charges? Who dropped the charges. We were friends, we were drunk. It was a... stupid night. Why that marsh? Why take her there? She took me. Said the marsh was a nice place to take a walk, so we took a walk, and I'll regret it for the rest of my life. [soft dramatic music] Raims, what you doing? Reading. Books? Okay, Raim, wanna put that away now? Join planet Earth? [sighs] Gordo wore a Yankees cap to school today. Shut your face. Was he killed? They won the World Series, Mom, and I'm gonna wear one too. Really? Hmm. Have fun growing up in the sewer with the alligators. Who's gonna buy you this hat? Nuh-uh, don't look at me. One lousy World Series and your daughter turns over to the enemy.

That's about as much as I can say. I spoke to Thomas. He assured me that you would be happy to backup his version of that night. Was that because he knew you wouldn't say anything at all? He also told me that what happened that night was nothing more than a "youthful indiscretion." You understand what a "youthful indiscretion" is, don't you? I do. This was not. What was it then?

Dude had a quashed s*x assault charge two years ago, which I don't even know how you know about because the case was wiped. Look, the woman he was assaulting was a nurse. If... if the case was quashed, that means nobody talked to him. Nobody thought to, so we're running two vics off this Nightingale guy. Do we really need more than that? We? You've been on the Task Force for what, five minutes? You even unpack your toothbrush yet? Can we do this, please? Absolutely. What? What do you wanna hear? Okay. Last night was awkward. I'm on the couch, but it was... it was good. It's probably the first time in two years I've felt like a normal person, so... [soft music] Okay, we good? Everybody happy?

It's nothing. You need to go. What? Go. No. You're my best friend. Your mother's remains were just found 20 years after she was abducted, and that's awful, and that woman practically raised me too, and you shouldn't have to bear any of this alone. Come on, Raim, when have you not been able to tell me anything. You can't possibly understand how complicated my life is right now. Trust me.
