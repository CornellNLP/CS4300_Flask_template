 My name is Detective Raimy Sullivan. 
 My father was killed in 1996. 
 Last night... 
 [radio static] 
 Hello? 
 Hey. 
 I spoke to him. 
 Your father? 
 Dad? 
 So you're telling me  that in 20 years, I'm gonna be on the job with my daughter? 
 No. You die tomorrow. 
 [gunshot] 
 [tires squeal] 
 [gasps] 
 Dad survived, but saving his life changed everything. 
 We've ID'd the remains from the marsh. 
 I'm sorry, Raimy. It's your mom. 
 The most wanted serial killer in New York took my mom. 
 Now whatever we do, however we try to fix things, history keeps changing. Your name is Daniel Lawrence. How do you know my name? I'm your girlfriend. I've never been to Queens, and I don't know you. I'm sorry. All I want is to get back what I lost. Previously, on "Frequency"... I can't get you out of my head. And he was gonna propose to you? Miracella. You know, I don't even know what Frank's undercover name was. It was Frank. Guess it was easier to keep his name when everything else was a lie. We loved each other. That was real. You set me up. It's your word against mine. St. Abigail's church in Manhattan. I'm a deacon there. I worked for the folks who ran Hideaway back in the '80s. Kills me to think the Nightingale had anything to do with this place. I have information about the Nightingale killer. My name is Meghan. This man is a monster! Please...

One of the occupants of the house, Mrs. Amelia Corrado, was rushed to the hospital with severe burns. Police are investigating possible ties to a recent surge in gang related violence in the area. [phone ringing] And now for the traffic report. [phone ringing] Hello? No, I heard, I heard. You okay? No, no, no, Miracella, you gotta call... Fine. Fine. When? NYPD, 21st precinct, how can I help you? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Lisa, you take this down? Yeah. Came in from Bellevue. Lady said that she had info on the Nightingale. I asked her her name, and she said Meghan, and then she hung up. You didn't call back? Follow up? You know how many tips came in that day? It doesn't matter. We dig into every one. If this Meghan calls again, you put her straight through to my cell. Bellevue Hospital, please hold. Detective Sullivan. I called about a Meghan who phoned in with information about a homicide. I was hoping you could help me find her. I don't have a last name. Probably Meghan Womack. She's in and out of here a lot. Meghan was transferred over to Langdon Hospital yesterday, longer term care. I found Meghan hiding in a doctor's office, on the phone. I hung it up and she went nuts, saying that she knew who the Nightingale was. She ever say anything like that before? Except yesterday. She was kicking and screaming when we transferred her. Calling her dad a monster, yelling he was going to kill her. Her dad? You know his name? Nah. Feel bad for him. Nice guy. He's a deacon or something over at St. Abigail's. Joe Hurley? Caucasian guy, 6'2", blond, beard? Yeah. Yeah, that's him. Thanks. They firebombed my house. One of Stan's guys. My mom was all by herself. Second-degree burns. They had to put her on a respirator because of all the smoke. Why's Stan still coming after you? I talked to him. 'Cause I'm earning a living. You're still dealing? Why don't you just go ahead and put a bullet in your own head? Save Stan the trouble, huh? You don't get to do that. You blew up my life. You lied to me. At least I have the balls to tell you what I'm doing to your face. I've been taking care of myself. All right. I made choices. But you're making choices now too. Think about it. Even if I got out today, it doesn't matter. It never did. Everything I know about Stan, who he deals with, who he protects, you think he's going to let me get my nails done and go home? It seems like your best option right now is witness protection. You're kidding, right? I'm not a rat. Stan killed my brother. He put my mom in the hospital. He tried to kill me. Yeah, so testify against him. Screw testifying. I got another way. There's a meeting I know. Maybe you tape it. What kind of meeting? Every week, Stan meets with this bookkeeper. Alonzo Benz's guy. That's when he gets his cut for protecting Benz's operation. And that's when Stan gives the bookkeeper all the busts Narco's running that week. No phones. Even if you're right, no cop is gonna touch an officer like Stan. That... that's a crapshow, seven different ways. This is what you do, Frank. This is how we get him. How we... [chuckles] Sounds like I'm the one that's sticking my neck out here, doesn't it? Really? You don't think Stan's gonna know it was me who told you? You know it's better for both of us if he's gone. So what happens to you then, huh? You just go off on your merry way? Me, you thank, for giving you Stan. After this, we're even. You don't owe me anything. What do you mean you don't know where she is? Meghan escaped? And we already contacted the police. When? We realized she was gone a couple of hours ago. Did her dad show up here at any point? Joe Hurley? Mr. Hurley is her stepfather, but no. [phone ringing] We notified him. He hasn't come. One second. Detective Sullivan. Detective, I have that Meghan on the line for you. Put her through. Meghan? You're the detective on the news. You have to help me. Of course. Where are you? I'm on Hudson Street near Tompkins Road. In front of an old gas station. Just sit tight. I'm headed there right now. Oh, my God. Meghan, what's wrong? Meghan? [dramatic music] [tires screeching] Meghan? Meghan! ♪ ♪ Hold on a second. You're saying that this girl from the camp, Meghan, the one that cut herself and was running around naked, you're saying she's Deacon Joe's stepdaughter? It only gets weirder. The day Meghan cut herself, June 28, 1991, the Deacon filed a complaint against her claiming she tried to kill him. Yeah, I don't know. This girl is starting to sound... Crazy? Maybe. But why would Meghan try to kill her stepdad? She never hurt anyone else as far as the record shows. Not her mom, not her brother. What happened between her and the Deacon? You catch up with the mom? No. Her, the brother, I can't find them. There's no current addresses, there's no numbers. Listen, you need to find Meghan in '96. Get her to spill everything she knows about the Nightingale. Yeah. I-I... Something up with you? I got a Stan situation. Miracella tipped me off about this meeting  that's happening between Stan and some money guy, this big drug dealer. Now if I can just... if I can get that on tape, you know, I can put Stan away. This a Stan situation or a Miracella situation? Now look, so now... now you're pissed about her? Look, I understood the whole other woman thing when you were undercover. I don't understand it when it gets in the way of saving your wife. Hey, nothing comes before your mother, you know that. What's going on here, Dad? I owe this woman, Raims, okay? I mean, I-I got her brother killed. I threw a grenade on her life. And yet she keeps coming back. What exactly do you owe her? What exactly are you getting at, Raimy? You told me that when you were undercover you lost your way. Does Miracella have something on you? No, Raims, this is my chance to bust Stan, okay? And yeah, if I can help Miracella out, who I lied to for two years and split on, sure. Like you did with me and Mom. Whoa. You really want to go there right now? No, we are not going to do this again because we don't have time. You need to find Meghan. She knows who the Nightingale is. Yeah, or she's crazy. Just find her, please. Uh, hi there. Don't say anything. You saw him. Fine. Saw who? South African not-Mosbey slinking out of your house this morning? I applaud it. So, we like him? Not like him? Like him? Like him. Like him. A lot. I can't explain it. It's... it's just right. [laughing] Oh, hey. Can I date Mosbey? Purely sexual. [chuckles] Thanks for coming, man. Tech's all jammed up with bigger cases, and my thing, it's... it's small scale, you know. It's outside, two players, in a cemetery. They moving? Nah. And it's during the week, so it should be deserted. Man, my little girl could wire this show in her sleep. Remember what we did to that Newburgh Club with Little Jay? I'll put a wire down a dude's pants if you want me to. Yeah, no, I think we'll just save that for next time. Your loss. So I'll run the box. Nah, I could be there for hours. Just, uh, show me what buttons to push. This from the guy who drowned my best bug in the nastiest urinal in the state. I appreciate this, man, I really do. I need the work. And you were solid for me when they bounced me. One of the only ones. Like an elephant up here. Yo. Hang on. Yeah, I gotta go. We'll pick this up at the site. What you doing, man... Amani Hill, huh? What, are you running a halfway house for ex-cops now? You really want to know? 'Cause before, you didn't. Fine. He's helping me bug a meeting. Between some high level drug players and Stan. And where did you hear this? You've been on the task force 24-7. Miracella, all right? Oh, man. Hey, Stan's guys tried to have her killed twice, Satch. Miracella? You're gonna walk off the plank for this chick? It's not about her. Look, you've been in this spin cycle ever since she showed up. Listen to me, Satch, I worked with Stan every day for two years. He didn't expect me to get that close to Little Jay, find out that they were working together, but I did. So then he had to get rid of me, right? He set me up to die in that shipyard. So you're saying that Stan Moreno put a hit out on you? I'm not saying it, man. He did. Okay, so let's say for one second that this it true, all right? This is what IAB is for. You can't just go rogue. I tried that. As soon as I got out from under Stan, he... he shredded my credibility with them. Okay, so if you trust this chick so much, drive her ass down to the DA. Let them figure it out. And have Stan do to her what he did to me? Come on, man. If this goes off without a hitch, none of us were involved, okay? We drop the tape off on the DA's desk. They take it from there. Frank, listen to me. Man, if this goes sideways, which there's about 200 ways that this can go wrong, your career is over. Or worse. He is dirty, Satch. And you know it. There's not straight way of taking down Stan. This is the only way. [scoffs] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I'm looking for Meghan Womack. That's here. Right there? Thanks. Meghan Womack? Hi. I'm Detective Frank Sullivan, NYPD. Don't worry. You're not in trouble. Listen, I'm kinda hoping that you can help out here, answer a few questions for me. Okay. Now I'm not sure if you know this or not, by an acquaintance of yours from the Hideaway Mountain Camp, Larissa Abbott, she's been missing since '94. Oh. The camp was a really bad time for me. I mean, I barely knew her. Listen, we have... we have reason to believe that whoever took her came through that camp, okay? So we're looking at everybody now. We're looking at campers, at staff, to, uh, well, the group that came up from St. Abigail's. And we do know that your stepfather, Joe Hurley, ran that group, right? So... You think Joe was involved? I'm just trying to cover my bases here. We also read in Larissa's diaries that, uh, you were scared of something. And we know that you tried to harm Joe, so for a girl your age, there had to be a really big reason, and I just need to know... Meghan, did... did he hurt you? I can't do this. I have to get back to work. I get that, I do. You don't... You don't get it. Every time I open my mouth, it's worse for me. Meghan. Meghan, listen to me. I know you're scared. But whatever you say to me, that stays between us, okay? Your stepfather, he's never going to hear any of this. I promise you that, okay? [exhales deeply] Everybody in town looked up to him. Deacon Joe, perfect husband, perfect dad. He hit us for years. Fists, belt. My mom, my little brother, and me. He used to take us to the Hideaway camp with him. And we'd stay in a trailer in the woods. And one year, when we first got there, he beat Robbie really bad. I didn't care what he did to me. I was gonna kill him. But he was too strong. The police came and... my mom and Robbie backed him up. They said that I was the crazy one. They were so scared of him. And that's when I cut myself. I walked up to daily prayer, naked. I wanted him to know... I wanted everyone to know... we weren't okay. That was the first time Joe had me locked away. Do you think that Joe has something to do with Larissa's disappearance? I don't know. That's okay. Do you think that, uh, that your mom or Robbie, they might know anything? A year after I was committed, the first time, my brother Robbie came to see me. He said that... Joe had murdered Mom. He said not to tell anyone. That Joe would get him. And then... Robbie stopped coming too. I've tried to get in touch with him for years. I think Joe killed him. Do you have any... any proof of any of this? Of Robbie or your mother? She would never stop coming to see me. My mom came every week. Sometimes two or three times. And why would he kill her? Because she went back to work. He hated that she was always at the hospital instead of home. Did you say hospital? My mom was an RN. Joe couldn't stand that she was starting a life of her own. Your mother's a nurse. 
 
 Oh. Vindaloo, garlic naan, okra. You managed to get all of my favorites and nothing I hate. How's that possible? I guess ordering is my secret superpower. What? No, usually it takes me weeks to let my guard down. I mean, I don't even show my loft until the third date. It that an architect thing? [phone ringing] No, it's an intimacy thing. Mm-hmm. Did I pass your test? Yeah, I couldn't concentrate at all today. In meetings, phone calls, I just... kept playing the night over and over in my head. Pornographic, really. Really? You know you can have... micro-strokes in your brain? Painless. You don't even know they happened. So this is brain damage? [phone ringing] [exhales sharply] Sorry, it's, um, it's probably work. [clears throat] Claire. Uh, no, no, no. I'm... I'm home. Of course not. Yeah. It's my girlfriend. She's on her way over. Her trip got cut short. Your girlfriend? Yeah. Uh, look, you should probably go. I guess I just thought that since we... Yeah, um, I'm sorry. I... You really didn't tell her? Can we talk about this later? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [ding] Meghan thinks that Joe killed her brother too. She's blaming herself. So you believe her now? 'Cause that's what Meghan was trying to tell me. That the Deacon murdered her family. That he's the Nightingale. We don't have any evidence, Raims. Meghan didn't see anybody get murdered. And even if Joe did kill them, it doesn't make him the Nightingale. Meghan's mom was a nurse. The Deacon knew Larissa from the camp in the Catskills. The Nightingale's truck is from the same area. It's all there. It's all circumstantial. Really? Really? Listen, even if we have enough to arrest him, I mean, that's... that's not what we're talking about here. You know, we're talking about more than that. We're talking about killing him, right? Me killing him. I mean, let's be clear about this. It's the only way. You saved Amanda Baldwin in '96. And 20 years later, the Nightingale still slit her throat. The trial could go south. He could escape. There's a thousand variables we can't even imagine. Branches upon branches. We... we have to cut off the trunk. And that's why we have to be clear. No doubts. We'll get the proof. Okay. Let me just finish this Stan thing, okay? And then I'm all over the Deacon. Good. Stop him from taking Mom. I will, but listen to me, Raims. You gotta find this Meghan girl, okay? She's been terrorized her whole life by this guy. I know. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Contemplating mortality? I'm mourning the waste. Look at all these dead people taking up all this space. Headstones, coffins, flowers. I'm going cremation, man. Look, today we need these headstones, okay? Especially that one right there. You see that little angel next to that tree? Gabriel Marquez Moreno. That's where the meet's going down. All right. Listen to me, Amani. I get one shot at this, all right? And this guy, I need this guy. You gotta come through for me. Yeah. Hey, did you get anywhere with Meghan or Deacon Joe yet? No. I'm headed to Westchester again. I'm gonna re-canvass. Whoa. Pump your brakes. I came in because you people are treating me like a fugitive. Harassing my neighbors, the people I work with. There was a police car outside of my house. Where were you yesterday, Mr. Hurley? I was visiting with a parishioner. For 24 hours? It was a crisis situation. And I'm sorry, I can't tell you anymore. You don't have to tell us what you talked about, but you do need to give us his name and his contact information. Can I at least know why? When the hospital notified you that Meghan was missing, did you go searching for her? No. Because I didn't have a clue where she would go. So you didn't pick her up in Westchester? What? No. Look, I was in the city all day. With this parishioner? That's what I said. All due respect, Deacon, you don't seem too upset that your daughter's been missing for over a day now. Well, you don't know Meghan like I do. You can't go chasing after her every time she runs off. What about your wife? You know where she is? My wife? Why are you asking me about her? Do you know where she is? Well, the last time I talked to Christa, she was in Arizona. And that was over 20 years ago. And you've had no further contact? What, you think Meghan is with her? We're looking into all the possibilities. How about you help us out here? Christa left in '92. I talked to her on and off for a few years. Sent her checks. You sent her money? Why would you do that? Because I loved her. And I wanted her to come back home. I didn't want her to starve. Raimy, there was nothing that we could hold the man on. I know. I just... when I talked to Meghan on the phone, she said she thought Deacon Joe killed her mom. Wait, wait, wait. What? So what, that just slipped your mind? You already had Meghan pegged as crazy. I didn't want to make her look worse without any evidence. So what? You just leave me in there to fly blind instead? Look, do me a favor, full disclosure next time. Now look, you bring in the Deacon's alibi and check his bank records. I'll reach out to the Tucson P.D. about the wife. That's all good, but the longer that Meghan's gone, the more it feels like she's not coming back. So what are you thinking? I'm gonna chase down a hunch. Wait. So that's it? What... what did I just say? ♪ ♪ [phone ringing] Yeah? Deacon Joe's alibi checks out. The guy he was visiting, Milo, used to be in his youth group. Now apparently Milo has issues because he used to be on drugs, and he felt like he was gonna fall off the wagon. So Deacon Joe stayed with him all day long. I don't buy it. The kid's lying for him. Maybe, but I did go pretty hard at the guy, though. The Deacon had the whole day to set up his alibi. When he saw the unit outside his house, he panicked. Figured better to walk in on his own, throw us off. So what? You think he has Meghan? I heard it in her voice. She's running from someone. And if she's right about Deacon Joe killing her mom,  he's not gonna let her talk. Yeah, well we're still waiting on the bank records. Where are you? On my way to the Deacon's house. You got no grounds to arrest him and that unit was called off. Do not go in there alone. Meghan begged me for help. And she would have called back if she could,  but something stopped her. I'm gonna make sure it wasn't him. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I'm here,  abuelo. Como siempre. You can relax, Sullivan. It's just me. No one's coming. Miracella strung you out good, man. Did she come crying to you about her house being fire-bombed? Actually what am I talking about? That watan's made out of stone. [chuckles] Look it up, Frank. It was one of her fellow players. She's making a big push to be the new Little Jay. Jumped over a lot of guys. We've been building a case against her for weeks. Even Satch tried to warn you,  and she gets you to jam us up? You got your head so far up it you can't even see daylight anymore. What happened to you, man? Gave up two years of your life to take scum like this down. You lost your wife, your daughter, and now you're protecting them? I know. I get why Miracella played you. See, the thing about loyalty is you gotta give loyal to get loyal,  and you dumped her ass the first chance that you got. In the end, all any of us have is loyalty, so you gotta ask yourself... I trusted you with my life. You're my partner. How could you rat me out? Don't say it's 'cause you're trying to save me from myself. You're right. You're right. I didn't do it for you, Frank. I did it for me. Satch, what are you... what are you saying, man? I guess when it comes down to it, I'm just a company man. And you... you going off rogue. Looking like you're in too deep with a bunch of drug dealers. I can't be a part of that. Are you for real right now? Huh? Are you telling me that... that you have more loyalty to Stan than you do for me? It's not about Stan. You're set on blowing up your career. I can't go down with you.

We're covered. This is not how we do things. Do you want to get the Nightingale or not? Would you like him to walk when we do? I was this close to him, Satch. He was right in front of me. I know. I know. But now we know who the Nightingale is, Raimy. After 20 years, we are going to get the Deacon. What about Meghan? What did he do with her? [knocking] Hey. Hey. What's going on? Hey, come in, come in. You okay? Here, come... come and sit down. I'm sorry I had to push you out like that. I hated putting you in the middle of... Daniel, stop. I saw your girlfriend in the elevator... oh, fiancée... actually. She was wearing your ring. You said that I never bother to tell you the reasons for all the... the Christmases and... and the birthdays. The two years that I left you alone. I want to tell you everything. I need you to know. 'Cause I... I had blinders on. In my whole life, you have been the only one who has always been by my side, and I screwed that up. And I know that. Hey. Whatever it is, we'll handle it, okay? I'm here. I assumed that you told her about us. or that you were going to as soon as you could. It's messy, I get that. And I admit that I didn't want to think about it too hard, but you proposed to her... and then slept with me. Did you think I would be your mistress or... No, Raimy, Raimy, that's not what I wanted. Look... I mean, after I showed up at your house just drunk, and you drove me home, I got scared. I needed to get my life back in track, so I-I proposed. And it felt right. I mean, even the day after. But then I couldn't stop thinking about you. I couldn't sleep. I felt like I was losing my mind. Like maybe I was making the wrong choice. The safe choice. And then I drove to see you. And it was better than I could have ever imagined. I know that this all sounds awful. I didn't think it through. I guess what I'm asking you is... to bear with me while I break it off with her.
