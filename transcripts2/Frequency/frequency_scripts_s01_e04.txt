 So you're telling me that in 20 years I'm gonna be on the job with my daughter? 
 No, you die tomorrow. 
 [gunshot] 
 [gasps] 
 Dad survived, but saving his life changed everything. 
 We've ID'd the remains from the marsh. 
 I'm sorry Raimy, it's your mom. 
 The most wanted serial killer in New York took my mom. 
 Now, whatever we do, however we try to fix things, history keeps changing. Your name is Daniel Lawrence. How do you know my name? I'm your girlfriend. I've never been to Queens and I don't know you. I'm sorry. All I want is to get back what I lost. Previously on “Frequency”... We changed something. You lived, but Mom died. How is that even possible? The Nightingale Killer. He lived, and he's killed at least 20 more. I know I've caused you and Raims all kinds of pain. You need to leave, Frank. I'm gonna do everything in my power to save her. I want you to know that. After that, I don't really care what happens to me. Your life is in immediate danger right now. This Nightingale, he is going to come  and he is going to take you. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ What's your name, sweetheart? You're safe now, okay? If you tell me what happened, I can help you. The man, he took my mommy. [radio static] Found this in the unconfirmed Nightingale files. You know it? Yeah, Carmen Salinas. She was abducted four months ago; I'm familiar. Yeah, well her daughter was found walking down the middle of the street in Brooklyn the night she disappeared. The police who questioned her said she might have saw the whole thing. And since Carmen was a nurse, you want to know why we... Seems like a pretty straightforward Nightingale case. I agree. But we never found a body, and whatever other leads we had went cold. Okay, and this girl, Eva, what if... What if she saw something? She said a man took her mom. That's it. She was pretty traumatized, and her father didn't want us making things worse for her. Did anybody look at him for it? Of course. The guy's a good guy, though. He's a construction foreman, I think. But this messed him up, man. He still calls in to see about our progress. Could be the girl's ready to talk again. I wanna try pushing the ball forward. I'll take whatever you can get. Thank you. Afternoon. You Marco Salinas? Most days. What can I do for you? Detective Frank Sullivan. I was, uh, hoping I could ask you a few questions. Sweetie, go on inside. I'll be a few minutes. We can go get some ice cream or something. Seen you on the news. That drug thing. They're saying you're some kind of a hero. What are you doing on a missing persons? I'm actually working the Nightingale now. So, I wanted to take a closer look at your wife's case. Well, I'm happy to hear there's some fresh eyes, but I'm not sure how I can help you. I've been over everything a hundred times with you guys. Yeah, I know. I know. And I'm sorry about, uh, dropping by, you know. But I was on my way home. I live over near, uh, 35th. No kidding. Small world, you grow up here? Oh, yeah, yeah. Born and bred here. Went to Bayside High. Oh, well, I won't hold that against you. Went to Cardozo myself. Oh-ho. Go Judges. Oh, yeah, yeah. [chuckles] I know you want to talk to her but she didn't see anything. It's been four months since her disappearance. You know there's always a chance she'll remember something new. Thing is, we've had a pretty rough go. I can barely make it out of bed most days, and Eva, her and her mom were peas in a pod. Now her friends don't play with her at school. Her teachers treat her differently. It's a constant reminder. Still, I think she's starting to come to terms. And I don't want to jeopardize all that by dragging her through it all again so soon. I was in your shoes, I guess I'd do the same for my daughter. [chuckles] Tell you what. If she, um, if she says anything about it, you just give me a call, okay? Okay, her daughter's name is Eva? Yeah, yeah, she'd be 29 in 2016. Let's see. Eva Salinas. Lives in Brooklyn, dropped out of high school. Last steady job was in '09. She worked at a pet shop. You got all that on her file? No, Internet. Wow. Your dial-up's fast. Oh, that's right. She wrote a book. About the Nightingale. It came out four months ago. No kidding. See, on my end, it's been four months since her mother disappeared and Eva's not saying a word. Yeah, it was some kind of 20th anniversary thing. Someone on the task force read it. Said it didn't offer much. She tells the victim's stories, different theories. But it still sounds like she's finally talking. I mean, you should track her down. Dad, the Nightingale's next victim  disappears nine days from now in '96. That's where we should be working. Come on, Raims, this guy, you know, he just lost his wife. I mean, he's raising his daughter alone. I mean, may... maybe it's a long shot, right? But maybe this helps us stop the Nightingale before he gets his next victim. [clattering and crashing] Ha! This is it. You are a ham radio enthusiast. I'm working a case. With the other nerd cops. Don't you have a wife and kid to get home to? You're drunk. How dare you. Don't. Stop. Gordo. Gordo, stop, seriously. Ah! Ah! Mine. Hello. Is anyone there? Hey, why don't you go outside, you nerds. Get a life. Leave my friend alone. You used to be able to have fun, Raim. You know, you used to know how to blow off some steam and bring a guy home every now and then. Oh, please stop talking. But now, you're kind of a loser. [laughs] No offense, nerds. All right, take care of yourself. Okay, it's time to go home. Time to go home. Wait. Take this. I set up a Tinder account for you. You just gotta sign in, you do a little swiping. Hook up. Maybe get laid or something. I don't feel good. Yeah. [door closes] So Gordo still lives next door. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm, yeah. Ahem, yeah, anyway, so you'll, uh, you'll talk to Eva? Yeah, I'm on it. Night. Wait, wait, wait, wait, hey. What's Tinder? Good night. [door buzzes] [door buzzes] Salinas ain't around. You know where I can find her? You're a little late to the party. Police already been here. What police? What do you mean? Eva Salinas' been missing for three days. Thanks. How you doing? One of your guys told me you were handling the Eva Salinas case. Yeah. Detective Raimy Sullivan, 21st. [chuckles] Uh-huh. I'm with the Nightingale task force. Why are you looking at me like that? Sullivan. Nah, it's okay you didn't call me back. I admit I was a little surprised, but you don't gotta act all weird about it. What? [rock music] ♪ ♪ [both panting] You all right there? I'm fine. Kyle. Thank you. Eva Salinas. Are you aware that her mother was abducted by the Nightingale 20 years ago? I am aware of her mother's case. But you didn't think to notify the Nightingale task force regarding Eva's disappearance? Don't you think that's pretty pertinent information? No, I didn't notify the task force because her mother's disappearance was never confirmed a Nightingale. And also, Eva's not a nurse. But hey, if you want the case, here, knock yourself out. Where are you at so far? I took the report late last night from her father. We're going through her phone, her computer, retracing her steps. Not much else to it at this point. Look, I probably should have notified the task force. Maybe this would have been a little less... A little less weird. It's not weird. Okay. Look, I would like to talk to her father myself. And it might be easier if you came along. Assuming we can backburner whatever happened... here. [knocking] Marco, hey. Sorry to bother you. Detective, I thought we were square. Yeah, no, no. I'm off the clock here. It's unofficial. Just on the way to the park to pick up my daughter. Figured maybe you and Eva would want to join. Daddy, are we going to the park? There you go, good one. Oh, that's her right there. Daddy! Hi, sweetheart. Come here. Oh, kiddo! Muah. Hey, I want you to meet my friend. This is Eva. Eva, this is Raimy. Why don't you take her and go play, okay? Go. Come on. I'll be right over here, sweetie. Hey. Hey. Hey, this, um, this... this is my wife. This is Julie. Marco. I guess we're neighbors. Wow. That right? Yeah, Marco lives over on 33rd. He's a Bayside native too. All right. Yeah. Oh, um, I gotta go. So you, uh, you set with her. Yeah, no, I'm... I'm good. Thanks. Yeah. All right, I'll see you. Okay. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Bye. How long you two been separated? It's new. Yeah. Yeah, I gathered. Carmen and I, we weren't on the best of terms when she disappeared. We'd been talking about separating for months. I don't even know why anymore. That's the thing I regret the most: wasting that time. If I'd only known how little we had left. Daddy, look! [chuckles] [sighs] This was a good idea. Thanks. Yeah, man. Last time I talked to Eva, she said she was going for a run. We were supposed to meet for dinner after. And you tried calling her? Yeah. Five times. Didn't we already go through this? Mr. Salinas, I know this is hard. But there's always a chance you or your wife might remember something new. Well, after we didn't hear back, we went to her apartment. Marco found her purse. Inside was her phone and keys. And that's when we called the police. [scoffs] Three days ago. Honey, he told us they wait 48 hours. I don't need 48 hours to know something's happened. We don't know anything's happened. This isn't the first time Eva has vanished like this. Five years ago, it was a surprise trip to Thailand after we got married. Two years ago, she turned off her phone and holed up in a motel. Last year, when she was writing the book, there was a suicide attempt. What happened to her years ago was horrible. Her mother being taken like that. But after that, she just never really got her life together. It's always been hard for her. You know, trusting people. She trust you? I'm sorry? Daughters don't always tell dad everything. Maybe there is someone in her life you didn't know about. My daughter has no secrets from me. What is she doing here? You asked your questions, I answered them. This is a waste of time. Detective Sullivan is with the Nightingale task force. You think this is a Nightingale case? Sir, we have no reason to believe that at this point, but given what happened to your wife, we can't rule it out. Marco, she's gonna be okay. She's gonna show up in a couple of days. [stammers] You don't understand. I can't... I can't go through this again. I know, baby. [sobs] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [breathing heavily] My name is Eva Salinas. Call the police. I just escaped the Nightingale. There's a high school track near my apartment. I usually run there, but it was getting dark, so I stayed closer to home. It happened so fast. I heard someone behind me, but he grabbed me before I could turn around. I couldn't breathe. I must have passed out because I just remember waking up in that room. He had, um, wrapped my arms and my legs with duct tape. And stuffed a clo... Cloth in my mouth. I-I thought I was gonna die. Can you tell us how you got out of there? There was a-a rusted nail on the floor. I used it to file through the tape around my wrists. I pulled some boards from one of the windows, and I just ran. Just ran as fast as I could. This is the bodega where you called the police. Do you have any idea where you were being held? I don't... It was an old factory, I think. The area was industrial. I remember a sign for a street called Barnell. That's near the piers. Eva, did you see the man's face? No. He wore a mask. You told the cashier at the bodega that you escaped the Nightingale. How did you know it was him? Because he said... He said he took my mother. So did you and Eva have fun at the park today? I guess, yeah. Yeah? What did you guys talk about? Nothing much. Come on. You must have talked about something, right? I'm not supposed to tell you. Really? Why not? It's a secret. You know, sometimes... Sometimes it's okay to tell secrets, especially if... If you feel in your heart that you should. She saw him. She saw who? The man who took her mommy. Raims, well, I mean, what does that mean “she saw him”? She said she saw his face. [dog barking] [indistinct radio chatter] Excuse me. By all means. I know how you like to get there first. [tense music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ 
 
 Clear. This is where she got out. Got blood on the wall over here. Some food and wadded up duct tape. ♪ ♪ I'll call CSU. Good news or bad news? Hit me. The good news is I'm officially call this a Nightingale. Bad news is that hot stuff is getting sent packing 'cause he's not on the task force. You knew about that? Hey. If you were trying to keep it a secret, you did a lousy job. So that does it for me. Yeah. Thanks for helping out. So break it down for me. What, did I do something wrong? Is that it? No. You didn't do anything wrong. I just got a lot on my plate right now. Oh. Okay. No, seriously. No, really, really. My bad. I misread things. I'll see you around. Listen, Marco, I swear this was the last thing on my mind at the park, okay? That was just two kids talking. You know I got to do my due diligence. Eva, come here. Did you hear what the detective said? Yeah. And? Did you say something to his daughter? What about the man, sweetie? Did you tell her anything... Anything about the man who took mommy? Eva. This is really important, okay? So if you saw him, if you can give a description of him, this is gonna help a lot of people out, okay? I didn't see anything. What about what he was wearing? Can you remember what he wa... Hey, Frank. She didn't see anything, okay? What else do you want? Go on, Eva. You seem like a good guy. You do. I'd like to think it went down like you said: two kids talking and all. So you found the building? We did. And we've got people going over every inch of it collecting evidence. We'll find something. Okay. You did good, Eva. You might not remember this, but, uh, I actually think that we played together when we were little. That park on Little Neck with my dad. Oh, my God. I do remember that. Our dads were friends or something, right? Wow. So much of that time was a blur. For years after she disappeared, I think I was just... numb. Trying to make sense of it. Losing your mom like that doesn't make sense. My mom was Julie Sullivan. Oh, my God. The body they just found? I had no idea. I should have told you sooner. He took my mom only six months after he took your mother. So then you know what it's like. The loss. It drowns you. I used to pray every day, hoping somehow she was still alive, being kept somewhere. I used to dream about it. But now, after this, I hope she died quick. I feel like when we were little you told me you saw his face. Did I? Like I said, it's a blur. You know, he had a scar... on his left hand between his... his thumb and his forefinger. Across his palm? No, across the top, like this. Maybe two inches long. If I think of anything else. Or if you just want to talk, okay? Okay. Thanks. Is the press still outside? They are. And it's important we keep these details quiet, okay? Nightingale gains an advantage if he knows what we know. I'm, uh, sorry about last night. I had a few with Stewie at The Elbow. How's he doing? Still creepy? Yeah. You swipe right on anyone yet? I've been busy. You're gonna die alone. I worked a case with a detective today. Had zero recollection we hooked up before. That's, uh, I love that. That's horrible. Invite him over. Mm, no. Mm, yes. Why not? You'll think I'm crazy, but I feel bad about Daniel. Who? The guy that... Wait. The guy from the bar? Maybe. All right. Let me get this straight. You're afraid to sleep with the guy at work who you don't remember because you'd be cheating on the guy who doesn't remember you? [clinks bottle] Shame. [clinks bottle] Shame. That's what he said. For what he called the lies... [clinks glass] Shame. Wait, wait, wait. I have, like, 67 more shames. Ugh. Particular from your book. What so-called lies was he telling? I'm not sure specifically. I think he was offended by the way in which I wrote about him. Are you kidding me? Who's that? My case. Were you able to give the police a description? He always wore a mask, so I never saw his face. But he had a scar on his hand. Two inches long... What the hell is wrong with her? Sullivan! You want to tell me why the hell she was on the news last night? Believe me, I'm just as pissed as you are. Oh, I doubt that. These just came in? You mentioned the scar on his hand several times now, Eva. Do you want to tell me how you saw it? I guess it was hard to miss. So he wasn't wearing gloves? No, he had gloves. But he must have taken them off at some point, right? I mean, in order for you to see the scar. Yeah. He wore them sometimes. The only prints CSU found at the scene belonged to you, Eva. Not one other print. Not even a partial. What is this? What are you asking? That's the mask he wore, correct? Because the lab found zero traces of DNA in the fabric. No sweat, no hair follicles. Like it was straight off the rack. Are you actually suggesting this is some kind of hoax? This is what we found in less than 24 hours. Do you want to wait until we find more before you finally tell us the truth? Please don't be mad at me. What? I'm sorry. [scoffs] Why would you do something like this? I don't know. She bought the supplies at a hardware store in Red Hook; holed up in that factory for three days starving herself. You're kidding me. She wanted the attention. That's what she said. Her book flopped, and it didn't get her on the news, and she wanted to matter again like she did when she was little, and I fell for it. I wasted all of that time... Okay, now hold on. Raims, she knows something. All right, when you guys were kids, she told you that she saw the guy that took her mother. Well, she's probably lying about that too. Did you ask her about it? I tried. I'm not getting anywhere with her dad running interference. Hey. Do you have a sketch of the Nightingale in 2016? Taken from a witness in '09, but I can't exactly send it back in time to you. So there's got to be a transcript of the description, right? Somewhere. Find it. Read it to me. Hey, Janet, you got time for a sketch? You have the witness here? More or less. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Okay. It's almost identical. You think this will work? [indistinct chatter] Hey, Eva. Hi. Are you looking for my dad? He should be here soon. No, actually I was kinda hoping I could talk to you for a second, is that okay? Look, I know that it... It's hard to talk about what happened to your mom. I know that sometimes it's hard to find the words, right? So I'm just gonna need you to say yes or no, okay? Is this the man that took her? Eva? He doesn't always wear the hood, though. What... what do you mean? Ha... have you seen him before? What the hell are you doing? She saw him, Marco. She saw him. I don't give a damn who she saw. You go around me like this again, we're gonna have big problems. Do you understand? She saw the Nightingale. Let's go, sweetheart. Marco, she knows what he looks like. She needs to tell us what she saw. You got what you wanted. You're all over the news. The only woman to survive the Nightingale. You haven't told them yet? Not yet. I understand why you did it. I know what you've been through; how it affected you. I know it probably better than anyone in the world, which is why I want to offer you a way out. What do you mean? There are consequences for what you did. The resources you wasted. But if you tell me what I want to know, I can talk to the DA, the press. See if we can make this all go away. You would do that? Why didn't you give the police an official description of the man who took your mother? I was too scared... at first. Then it seemed like the less I said, the more people talked about me. I was on the news. I liked it. The night he took my mother, he wore that hood. I didn't see him enough to give a description. What about the other times that you saw him? Your father told you, didn't he? Those other times, they were supposed to be a secret. Why? If I told the police where I saw him, then my dad would find out that my mother was having an affair. That's why I never said anything, why I never put it in the book. An affair with the Nightingale? No. God, no. He was an accountant. And she would... bring me with her,  hoping that way Dad wouldn't suspect anything. But then she would make me go play across the street at the schoolyard. He had a truck. It was beat up, dark blue, had one of those white camper shells on the back. He had brown hair. Short, like the military. And he wore sunglasses. He always wore sunglasses. She saw him at least seven times. So he's stalking his victims. And he's taking his time doing it. She said it was over the course of months. He drove a dark blue truck, had a white camper shell on the back. Dad? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Dad, what is it? ♪ ♪ [kids laughing] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Step out of the vehicle, sir. [car engine starts] Step out of the vehicle, sir. Stop the truck, sir! ♪ ♪ She's out. Gave me the rundown on something called a Beanie Baby. Apparently that's a thing. Mm. Who was the man in the truck, Frank? Probably no one, Jules. It just... the truck matched a description of a case that I was looking into, that's all. Mm. I took Raimy to the park to meet that girl, Eva. And while we were there, her father called to cancel. He said you were hounding his daughter for information about the Nightingale. Jules, I can explain... Is that what their playdate yesterday was all about? No, it wasn't. I was off the clock. And I actually feel bad for the guy, you know. I thought I was trying to do something nice. Yeah, okay. You know what? I don't believe you. Okay, your daughter is not some tool you can use in your job. You can't expose her to this... This... darkness around you. What kind of darkness? The kid is nine years old. And Eva's mother was abducted by the Nightingale. Tell me. Who was in the truck? Eva placed the Nightingale in a blue truck with a white shell on the back, okay? Okay, so what? You're... You're just gonna torment everyone you see in a blue truck? Come on, Jules. I know it was him. You know it was him. You saw the way he drove away. Yeah. You were pulling your gun, Frank. Okay. Am I in danger? For real, Frank? Yes. Jules, you are. Okay, it's me and every other nurse in this city. Look. I carpool to work. I-I don't go out alone. I'm taking precautions, okay? Okay. And I will even look out for this blue truck, but I do not want Raimy knowing anything about this. Okay. Okay. You still have that gun that I gave you in the closet? No. No, I packed that in the stuff you took to Satch's. Okay, then I want you to take this, okay? Please? No. Jules, please. Frank, no, I'm sorry. I do not want it. 65742. Little girl did good, Frank. Thanks. Hey, I want to thank you again, Marco, for bringing her in. Having a description of this guy is a big deal. You did the right thing, man. Daddy, are there still reporters outside? I don't know, sweetie. I hope not. Well, there might be a few. You want me to have an officer escort you out? It's fine. I don't mind. Hey. Just heard from the DA. He's on board. She walks as long as she agrees to counseling. She owes you big time. Yeah, I think she's paid enough. [scoffs] It's a shame, you know? Someone like her, so busy looking back, she can't see the life ahead she has to live. [sighs] And he was gonna propose to you? Daniel just seemed so small, I guess, compared to Mom, so I never brought it up. Now he doesn't even know who you are. That's rough, kiddo. Look, Raims, you can't put your life on hold. We're doing our best here, but, I mean, there's no guarantees. Hold on, now we're losing? We're not winning. I'm not saying that we won't. I'm just saying we mess this up somehow, and there's a chance it doesn't go back, you know? And that's... that's reality. I'm not willing to accept that, not yet. But we prepare for it. That's all I'm saying. [Lykke Li's “No Rest for the Wicked” playing] ♪ ♪
