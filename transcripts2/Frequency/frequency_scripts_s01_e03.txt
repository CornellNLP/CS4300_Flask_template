 My name is Detective Raimy Sullivan. 
 My father was killed in 1996. 
 Last night... 
 This is WQ2YV. 
 Hello? 
 Hey. 
 I spoke to him. 
 Your father? 
 Dad? 
 So you're telling me that in 20 years, I'm gonna be on the job with my daughter? 
 No, you die tomorrow. 
 [gunshot, tires squealing] 
 [engine revving] 
 [gasps] 
 Dad survived, but saving his life changed everything. 
 We've ID'd the remains from the marsh. 
 I'm sorry, Raimy. It's your mom. 
 The most wanted serial killer in New York took my mom. 
 Now, whatever we do, however we try to fix things, history keeps changing. 
 Your name is Daniel Lawrence. 
 How do you know my name? 
 I'm your girlfriend. 
 I've never been to Queens, and I don't know you. I'm sorry. 
 All I want is to get back what I lost. 
 Previously on "Frequency"... 
 We've changed something. Mom's gone. 
 Gone how? 
 The Nightingale Killer. 
 Positively identified as Julie Elizabeth Sullivan. 
 You need to tell her. 
 What am I supposed to say? 
 Raimy, I got your mother here, and I think she needs to hear it from you. 
 Jules asked me to ask you to stop. 
 You've been under for two years. 
 You need to leave, Frank. 
 This Goff guy stinks of something, and I need your help. You and my dad talked to Goff. 
 Yeah, but there was nothing there. 
 You Thomas Goff? 
 This is our attorney. We're done here. 
 Goff lived in Jersey, and now he's gone. 
 [grunts] 
 [whimpering] 
 Help me, Mother. 
 [radio static] 
 I went back to the Goff house. 
 You remember there was an outbuilding? 
 It's gone now. 
 Sometime after we changed history, it was torn down. 
 I think I know why. 
 There's a cellar. 
 I think that's where Goff kept his victims. 
 So you think he abducted Maya Gowen and held her down there. 
 She disappeared three days ago in '96. 
 It can't be a coincidence. 
 We know Maya and Goff went to the same college. 
 They grew up two miles from each other. 
 No, no, we already checked out the house, me and Satch, and after we got through with the mom, who practically had a choke collar on him, he wasn't saying anything. 
 You got to go back. The outbuilding. 
 Find out what exactly is going on in there. 
 Wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. 
 Do you have any evidence that somebody was being held down there? 
 It's been 20 years, but Goff could've taken Maya. 
 He could be the Nightingale, and we could save Mom. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Gordo. 
 I'm sorry I took your head off last night. 
 Never apologize, remember? Not with us. 
 You told me that when you were ten. 
 So tell me what I should do here. 
 Your mom's family keeps text-bombing me. 
 You're not returning their calls. 
 I can't deal with them right now. 
 That's what I said, in nicer words. 
 They want to plan a service for your mom. 
 I don't want one. 
 I figured that too. 
 I'd say I'm sorry... 
 But we don't do that. 
 Carry on. 
 [knock on door] 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, you. 
 [chuckles] 
 How you doing? 
 You settling in? 
 Yeah, man. 
 Hey, sorry about washing up on your front porch like that. 
 Please, stay as long as you like. 
 No, I'm dead serious. 
 It keeps Leah's broke-ass cousins out of here. 
 [laughs] Thanks. 
 And of course, you got that thing set up before you even put your clothes on. 
 You're officially a nerd, my man. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Listen, we got to double back to Goff's house. 
 Jersey? 
 Oh, right, because Ma Goff's friendlier today. 
 No, just... I think we missed something. 
 Like what? 
 I don't know yet. 
 Let me guess, this is another one of your hunches. 
 Hey, look, what do you want me to say, huh? 
 All right, well, come on. Let's get some grub. 
 Leah's making eggs. 
 No, no, drive-through, man. 
 We got to beat the traffic. 
 Sure. Why sit down and eat like a human being when you can stuff your face while I drive? 
 Exactly. 
 Mother... 
 [tapping] 
 [electronic warbling] 
 Mike, do a search for me? 
 You'll owe me your firstborn, but yeah. 
 Maya Elise Gowen, missing person. 
 No one found her. 
 That's what it says. 
 [Maya panting] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [gasping and panting] 
 Look, Maya and Goff grew up in the same town. 
 They went to high school together. 
 She goes missing, and he's got a rape charge? 
 Expunged rape charge. 
 And you didn't mention the girl yesterday. Why? 
 I came across it late last night. 
 You want to tell me our play here? 
 Let's check out the shed. 
 Without a warrant? 
 Oh, here we go. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Mrs. Goff, where's Thomas? 
 You already talked to him. This is harassment. 
 Where are you going? 
 No, I want you off my property right now. 
 Ma'am, you're gonna have to calm down, okay? 
 Give me your badge numbers. 
 You got this shed locked. 
 I'm gonna need you to open it. 
 Are you insane? 
 I'm calling my lawyer. 
 Hey, we got to get in there, Satch. 
 What? Not without a warrant. 
 Give me a why. 
 No... what is he doing? What is he doing? 
 Exigent circumstances. 
 Stop it. 
 Oh, my God! There's nothing's in there. 
 You smell that? 
 Yeah, Frank, I smell it. 
 Bleach. 
 No, stop! 
 Get out! No. 
 Frank. 
 You can't do this! Get out! Get out! 
 You always clean out your cellars with bleach? 
 Huh? 
 All right, come on. 
 She was in here, wasn't she? The girl? Maya? 
 She was in here! 
 Hey, hey, hey.

 You go straight for the outbuilding and the hatch when there's a whole beautiful house to search. 
 Man, I've been under for two years. 
 Maybe I'm starting to think like a bad guy. 
 No, I know what this is. 
 It's like Wroblicki on his first day as a detective. 
 He's coming out of the deli with a sandwich when, bam, nearly gets knocked on his ass by some guy tearing down the street. 
 Wro chases the guy down, tackles him. 
 Turns out he knifed some mope a block away. 
 It's beginner's luck. 
 Hey, what do you think about Goff as the Nightingale? 
 If he is, we got to catch him by the letter, and I don't know what ugly habits those narcos taught you, but that's it for busting into sheds without probable cause. 
 Yeah. 
 I knew that son of a bitch took her. 
 Maya's still unconscious. 
 There's no telling what she's gonna remember. 
 Where are you with Goff? 
 I'm coming up empty. 
 What about the mom? 
 She's been running defense for him for years. 
 No, we had her in a box for two hours, her and her douche bag attorney, and she's not saying jack. 
 She's hiding her son. 
 He's the Nightingale. 
 Hold on. Hold on. 
 Maya wasn't a nurse. She doesn't fit the profile. 
 In '96, the Nightingale's still figuring out his MO, and Maya, she's so close. He knows her. 
 It's too easy to pass up. 
 Okay, well, that's your opinion. 
 You have a better one? 
 Or maybe you listen to me and find him. 
 Oh, sure, yeah. I'm just gonna go make a call. 
 Goff has been AWOL for 20 years on my end, and I am the one dealing with the fact that this psycho beat and strangled Mom. 
 Everybody wants a memorial for her. 
 They want to mourn her. Of course they do. 
 And I am the freak who is saying no because... because we're going to get her back. 
 I'm not gonna let anything happen to your mother, okay? 
 In fact, I'm, uh... 
 I'm seeing her tomorrow. 
 She still talking to you after all that crazy last night? 
 [chuckles] Yeah, trust me, it's not her choice. 
 She's doing two-a-days 'cause of her classes. 
 I get to babysit you. 
 You know it's not called "babysitting" when it's your own kid. 
 Oh, is that right? 
 I must've missed that in the book on parenting you wrote. 
 This is weird. 
 Nah. 
 You think? 
 [laughs] 
 [knock at door] 
 Huh. 
 You look like me the night before taxes, without the crying. 
 I feel like a freaking accountant. 20 years of property records to try and find a guy who's in the wind. 
 What, did he own half of New York? 
 Mostly Jersey. And his family. 
 Uh, speaking of, your aunt Eileen, not to mention your mom's whole nursing crew... 
 I'll call them off. 
 You don't have to. 
 I'm, uh... handling the service. 
 You're not flying into a rage. 
 This is good. I... 
 I thought you'd be pissed. 
 No, I-I get it. 
 Other people might need to mourn her. I just don't. 
 Thank you for taking it on, though. 
 I wanted to. 
 Do you want to get a slice or something? 
 I've hit a wall. 
 I can't. Laurel's pooping. 
 She doesn't wipe her own butt yet? She's seven. 
 She wipes. 
 I'm solo tonight. I got to get back. 
 Screw it. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Okay, so I got to ask. 
 What did you really think about my mom inviting you to dinner? 
 Um... [clears throat] 
 Well... I was fairly sure you were a morbid shut-in and that your poor mum had to find someone who was bleeding, incapacitated, and indebted to her to find you a date. 
 You don't hold back, do you? 
 You're a detective. 
 I'm already terrified to lie to you. 
 My mom is worried I won't even have cats when I die alone. 
 I'll just be found spooning case files. 
 Why do I doubt that could ever happen to you? 
 No, you'd be surprised. 
 Now, the real question is, how horrified were you that some desperate bloke would actually show up to a stranger's house to meet her shut-in daughter? 
 Honestly, I thought you were hitting it off so well with my mom, you were trying to get a party started with her.

 You stay late on Sundays, people kill the Coltrane and play Loverboy, and where else can you get that, right?

 You know, my friend has had a rough couple of days, and can I be up front with you here? 
 Uh, this is making me super uncomfortable, so why don't we all just head home? 
 Sundays. 
 [chuckles] 
 I come on Sundays. 
 We must've just missed each other. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 [rock music] 
 What the hell was that? 
 We had a thing once. 
 You and the Australian guy you've never mentioned. 
 South African. 
 Same thing. 
 Oh, is he the reason we're here tonight? 
 Oh, so you were stalking that dude. 
 There may be a case for that. 
 Yeah, you might want to let that one go.

 I can't believe you dumped Raimy. 
 We got a last-second break on the Nightingale, Jules. 
 I thought we had him. 
 It's the job, Frank. 
 It's always the job, right? You know I get it. 
 You know, I'm under the same kind pressure, but, Frank, it's been two years of "Daddy will be home for Christmas." 
 He'll be here for your birthday when you're seven, or when you're eight. 
 Maybe you just shouldn't make promises. 
 No, I want her with me. I want her to stay here with me. 
 You know what she said when she got home last night? 
 "Everybody needs to stop lying to me. 
 I'm not a baby anymore." 
 Of course she did. 
 She knows you almost died. 
 She read the papers. 
 She heard your friends at the parties. 
 Hey, what could I do, huh? 
 Tell her that Daddy almost bled out in a shipyard? 
 When you were gone, she slept with one of your old sweaters every night 'cause it reminded her of you. 
 I didn't know that. 
 Yeah. 
 Frank, you have no idea how much she missed you and how terrified she was you were never coming back. 
 So she needs to come first now. 
 Jules, this...
