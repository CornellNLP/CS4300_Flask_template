 My name is Detective Raimy Sullivan. My father was killed in 1996. 
 Last night...  
 [radio static] Hello? Hey. I spoke to him. Your father? Dad?  So you're telling me No. You die tomorrow. [gunshot] [tires squeal] [gasps] Dad survived, but saving his life changed everything. We've ID'd the remains from the marsh. I'm sorry, Raimy. It's your mom. The most wanted serial killer in New York took my mom. Now whatever we do, however we try to fix things, history keeps changing. Your name is Daniel Lawrence. How do you know my name? I'm your girlfriend. I've never been to Queens, and I don't know you. I'm sorry. All I want is to get back what I lost. Previously, on "Frequency"... You remember that truck that Eva said she saw before her mom's disappearance? Yeah. Yeah, the blue camper. Yeah, I saw it the other day. You and your mom were at the park and he was watching. The Nightingale is stalking Mom. I chased him and he got away. It doesn't matter. We know where he's gonna be. In two days' time, he takes Amanda Baldwin. Amanda, is there someone else here? No, what's wrong? [dramatic music] [grunts] When I was undercover, there was someone. It's not going away like I thought it would. Whatever stupid thing you did... [camera shutters clicking]  [indistinct radio chatter] Any idea what that is? [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [ambient music] ♪ ♪ Good afternoon. We begin our broadcast with some tragic news. Amanda Baldwin, once a target of the infamous Nightingale Killer was recently found dead in her East Village apartment. She was 46 years old. It's almost 20 years ago to the day that Amanda was first targeted by the Nightingale. Some sources close to the investigation have indicated that this might indeed be the work of the notorious Nightingale Killer. Again, we do not yet have confirmation about the Nightingale. [Gin Blossoms' "Hey Jealousy"] ♪ Do you think it'd be all right ♪ 
♪ If I could just crash here tonight? ♪ Hey, yo, turn it up. Turn it up. All right, brother. See you soon, man. An alleged attempted abduction by the so-called Nightingale Killer was foiled, saving the life of 26-year-old Amanda Baldwin... To the task force. Yes, sir. It was all Frank. Detective Frank Sullivan recently helped... Nightingale still out there though. True. We'll take the win. Can I get you another? Nah, man. I got something better waiting for me at home. Heh. [speaks indistinctly] Bringing the grim total number of Nightingale victims to 22. You mind turning that off? Our thoughts and prayers go to Miss Baldwin's family. New York today... [somber orchestral music] ♪ ♪ Well, hello there. Officer, sir. [both chuckling] both : ♪ Mommy and Daddy sitting in a tree ♪ 
♪ K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪ ♪ ♪ [radio static] Have a seat. I'm good. This job will break you, if you're not careful. [door clicks shut] This photo... [tapping] That's troubling. I'm fine. I reached out to the chief of detectives. I'm worried about how personal this has become for you, how emotions can cloud your judgment. If Satch was worried, he'd tell me. Satch put his papers in. What? He's retiring. No, I know what it means. Why? [ambient music] He was tired, got too close to it. Chief asked me to look after the task force till a replacement's found. You'll report directly to me. That's not the chain of command. The chief... The chief of D's said until things get sorted, you come to me. That a problem? No. Good. Listen. Could be time for fresh eyes all around. Meaning? Push too hard, you burn out quick. You're a good detective. We could work together, start over. If we're done, I should really get back. Think about it. Dismissed. ♪ ♪ [machine humming] NYPD Sergeant Eligibility List. Okay, this is it. This is it, come on, Satch. [machine humming] Boom! He made it! [laughter and applause] Satch Reyna, right here. Yes. Yes. [laughs] Uh, uh! See, you didn't think I could do it. I can't believe I'm looking at a future sergeant. Hey, man, don't expect salutes. [phone rings] Hey, Leah. Guess what, baby. [phone ringing] Daddy got some good news. That's right. That's right. I made the first group. Sullivan. Could be seeing a promotion in a couple of months. Maybe weeks. [chuckles] [somber piano music] Oh, yeah, yeah, that sounds good. All right. All right, talk to you later. I love you. Perfect, thank you. Hey, uh, Leah wants to have a little something at the house and would love for you to come. With Jules. Is that cool? Yeah, yeah. Check it out. CSU got a VIN number on the burned engine block. Off the Nightingale truck? Pulled... pulled the DMV records. Earl Bradley, 34-year-old male. Never reported the truck missing. Come on, it can't be that easy, right? There's only one way to find out. [soft brooding music] ♪ ♪ Earl Bradley? You know, I'd feel a lot better if we could talk without the knife. Of course. Yeah. Sorry about that. Detective Sullivan, this is Detective Reyna. What's this about? Do you own a dark blue truck, white camper shell? I do. Where... where is this truck right now? I keep it at my summer cabin up in the Catskills, but haven't been up there in over two years. Something wrong? Anyone have access to this cabin or use it when you're not there? No, just me. Trying to sell it, actually, but it's been tough with it being so rural. My ex moved my only daughter down to Dallas a few years ago and I've been spending my summers with her. Hoping to buy a second place down there if I could sell. What's all this about? [radio static] ♪ ♪ One, two, three. Say cheese. [applause] Come here. Mwah. Love you. I'll be right back. Okay. [indistinct talking] [gasps] Look who it is. See, I told you your boy would make detective. Yeah. And don't you ladies worry. I'll make sure I come and check in on you. Check in? Why? Hey, love. Hey. Mwah. Hey, did you get a cupcake? [nervous chuckle] What's up? What did you not tell me, love? Oh, no, Jules, no, no, this is good. I got promoted in narcotics. They're looking for undercovers. Okay, what does that mean? What does that mean? I mean, it's big. Baby, it means more money, it means a fast track to third-grade detective. But you'd have to go undercover. No, no, no, I get to go undercover. I mean, this is... this is a chance for me to do some real good. How long? Probably just a... a couple months. It's not long, you know. But I promise you I'm gonna be home in time for "Christmas Carol" in the city. How 'bout that? Jules, come on. This is gonna be good for us. This is gonna make us stronger, okay? Mm. Raimy, you there? Raimes? Yeah. I'm here. Hey, so we just caught a break on the blue truck. It was, uh, stolen from a cabin up in the Catskills. We're heading up there now to check it out. Okay. I'll double-check the files, see if there's any Catskills connections that might have been overlooked. Yeah, yeah. Use, uh, use Satch. He keeps crazy notes. He probably still does, right? Yeah, he's the best. Good, good. Hey, Dad, listen. You know that photo from your wallet? Yeah? The Nightingale left it in Amanda's hands after he slit her throat. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ What do you think it means? You listen to me, kiddo. Don't let him get in your head. You hear me? I mean, may... maybe it doesn't mean anything, you know? Do you really believe that? Why didn't he just kill you then when he had the chance? I don't know. Made him feel more powerful to let me live? He's toying with us. He's always one step ahead. How do we catch up? [tapping] I need help. I... who... wait, who are you? I know Frank. He said he would help me if I was ever in trouble. My brother Ricky and Frank were friends when he was undercover. Please help. [uneasy ambient music] ♪ ♪ Come in. Thank you. There is a police detail out front. I'll get them. No, please. The police are the ones who did this to me. [doorbell chimes] You let Stan Moreno tell me you put in your papers? Sorry about the, uh... Solomon's junior high graduation. I remember that. I don't. Because I missed it. So what's up? Is it true? I've been doing this a long time. I know. And I get it, but we're gonna catch him, together. You just have to do it a little longer. Fresh eyes. Stan was right about that. No, he wasn't. You can't leave me to work with Stan Moreno. Oh, here we go again. Why do you always defend him? Look, I've known Stan for a long time. And no matter what you think of him, you can't argue that the man gets results. Unlike me. Done with your pity party? [ambient music] ♪ ♪ I know you got my voicemails. It's the one thing that gave me pause on my way to the Pension Board. ♪ ♪ [indistinct radio chatter] Anything? A few partials. Maybe we'll get lucky. Closest neighbor's a mile off. Nobody noticed anything. 'Bout local PD? They know everything about who owes who money. There's a manager of the water department who's cheating on his wife. But as far as a blue truck or any strangers lurking around or suspicious activity, we got nothing. None of our vics have any connection to this area. Maybe the Nightingale does. So what is it? Why does a New York City serial killer steal a truck from the Catskills? Frank will call back soon. He always does. Are you a doctor? I'm a nurse. All right, let's see. All right. This is gonna sting a little. Miracella. That's a pretty name. You know, I don't even know what Frank's undercover name was. It was Frank. Guess it was easier to keep his name when everything else was a lie. Frank and, uh, your brother, they were close? They were. Ricky was killed. I'm... I'm sorry to hear that. I'll get you some water. [faucet running] Is that your daughter? Yeah. She's our daughter. He never told me. Never told me any of this. [ambient music] ♪ ♪ I'll try Frank again. I want to go over the files again. Which files? All of them. See if there's any connection to the Catskills. What? What put you onto that? I did some digging. You remember that blue truck my dad and you traced up there? It was a solid lead. Yeah, that went nowhere. So we look again. Oh, man. What did you once tell me? The answers are always in the files. [scoffs] You think I have stars in my eyes. Stan thinks I'm burning out. You know what? Why don't I just help you attach the hose to your exhaust and call it a day? All right, you want to go over everything again? Youth is on your side, huh? Fresh eyes, right? Forget the precinct. Come on! Light is on the left. [brooding music] ♪ ♪ All right, fresh eyes. Everything you need is right here. So have a party, make some confetti. Tear the place down. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 Julie? [door shuts] Jules? Hey. What's up? You gonna talk to me? What's up? Where... where's Raimy? Raimy's at Gordo's. Why? I wore my ring... while you were gone. The whole time. You didn't know that, did you? I'm a fool. That's what's wrong. Can you tell me what you... you're talking about? I asked you not to bring the job home. I didn't. Really? 'Cause she showed up today on my back porch, bleeding. Who? [ambient music] Miracella? ♪ ♪ What happened? I patched her up and I took her to your place. She needs you. Okay, okay, okay. Jules... You told me you went undercover for us. It was for us. It was for... Losing you to the job? That I could deal with. I wouldn't be the first. But this... This was the job. Jules, it was, okay, and I... and I know how that sounds. You got to understand that being undercover, it... it's just not something you do. You know, this is... this is a war... And it was your choice to go. Your choice to stay. Each step of the way, you made choices, Frank. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I... I should... I should have said something to you. When? Before you slept with her? During? After? Come on, like you didn't make choices too? Huh? Remember your options? You called me when I was still undercover and told me not to come home. You were never here. Yeah, and it didn't take you long to get over me, did it? Huh? Yeah, you moved on real quick, ring or no ring. I don't know. What are you talking about? Oh, come on, Jules. Ted? [dramatic music] Raimy's coach? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Ted's been here for me. He's encouraged me. Ted listens to me. You chose the job. And I chose to move on. You know, we keep score, and we both lose. [pen scratching] [door opens] You changed your pants. That's one small step for justice. I see your car was out there. Guess you've been dealing with this stuff all night, huh? Larissa Abbott. You remember that one? Cold case file, 2001. Partial remains found in the Catskills. She came in after 9/11, huh? Why? Her brother reported her missing in 1994. Seven years later on September 17th, a homeowner was expanding his property, dug up the remains. When the task force followed up, DNA confirmed her identity. Right, right, but she wasn't a nurse. No rosary beads. Not a Nightingale. They found the lower arm bones. What happened to the rest of her? Most of the bones were scattered, dragged away. But still, the forearms were found together. So you're thinking that maybe... Maybe they were found together because at one point they were bound together. [ominous music] Her brother lives in the city. I asked him to come in. You coming? ♪ ♪ [children yelling distantly] [car horn honks] Listen, Satch... Hey. I don't want to know. Just take care of it. I will. The hell is the matter with you, Frank, huh? Having her here could put my family at risk, jeopardize my promotion to sergeant, not to mention your own career. And what about Julie? I thought I told you once to put it right, man. Put this behind you before it's too late. I'll handle it. [scoffs] [door creaks open] Did you go to my house? Did you talk to my wife? All the lies. For two years. I tipped you off about this thing. I saved your life. Are you for real right now? You told me about the bust, you didn't bother telling me you were a cop. You're right. What happened? [ambient music] Why? [scoffs] You don't care. Come on, you know that's not true. I don't know anything anymore. Talk to me. What did you think was gonna happen? After your big departure? I had to survive. I needed money. And I knew where Ricky kept his stash. This guy, Ricky's buddy, offered to buy me out. I have enough to get out of New York, start a new life. Like you told me to. These other guys showed up. And I ran. Ricky's buddy dead in an alley. Who were these guys that came after you? I'm not saying anything. Was it Stan's guys, huh? No. Do you think I'm crazy? I'm trying to help you here! Do you think I'm crazy? You think I don't have ears? I heard what happened to you. How Stan set you up, killed Ricky, little Jay, even though he worked with both of them. He's killing anyone who knows he's dirty, so I'm not saying anything. All I want from you is a way out. Hey, we'll... we'll figure it out, okay? Things were supposed to go down differently. You were my ticket out, Frank. First of all, I never promised you anything. [scoffs] But didn't you? Blew in from a different world and made me believe you cared. That was promise enough. And don't tell me what you were feeling was an act when we were together. Because that... maybe only that... wasn't a lie. I... I would never disrespect what we had, but I told you months ago we did what we did and it's over now. Except I'm still there... Wondering what was real and what wasn't. Listen to me. No. I'm gonna help you. But I can't be with you. I'm sorry. You can stay here. You can get some sleep. I'm gonna figure this out. Larissa and I were close as kids, but she was older than me. And when she started working, we kind of drifted apart. What do you recall about that period before she disappeared? She was dating this guy. Mateo Rivera. Whole town thought he did it when she disappeared, but I never did. Why not? I kind of looked up to him, I guess. First guy that could handle Larissa. My sister was complicated. How so? I think she just... needed to feel needed or wanted. Always felt like she had some demons, you know? She'd get depressed sometimes. Can you think of why? She and Mateo seemed kind of serious. As serious as Larissa got. Summer of '90, they planned this cross-country road trip. I was so jealous. But then, Larissa got a second job and things between them started to go south. She seemed preoccupied. I got sick of always being the one calling. Wait a minute. When was this? This second job? She started in '90 and worked for a couple summers, I think. Where? Youth camp in the Catskills. What was the name of this camp? Hideaway, maybe. I'm not sure. Yeah, but she was a teacher, right? What was it? Art. She also moonlighted as the camp nurse. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Here. Okay. You first. Well, we got the Hideaway Mountain Camp. It was a Christian youth camp. The owners are deceased. They opened it in 1959. They filed for bankruptcy in '92. That was the last summer Larissa worked there. The local sheriffs recall they just locked up and walked away. Now how in the hell did we not know she was a nurse? Employment records show that she was only first aid and CPR certified. So what, they just needed somebody to slap Band-Aids on knees? And Larissa was only a nurse at that camp. Okay. So if she was a Nightingale, then they only way they could have met was up there, right? Which means the Nightingale passed through that camp. Well, it looks like we're going on a road trip. [knocking] Hey. Hi. [The Wallflowers' "One Headlight" playing] Don't judge. I haven't had time to clean yet. Oh. [scoffs] I don't care. And with advanced warning, I make lunch, but for now, just snacks. Loads. Great. A requirement for emergency study sessions. So decision time. Would you like chamomile or Earl Grey... ♪ Come on, try a little ♪ ♪ Nothing is forever ♪ Mm. An hour north. It's a different world. I'm glad you came. Yeah. It's good. You know my folks immigrated here from Cuba in '74? I was eight years old. And it was post-Civil Rights, but still, people were like, "You make sure, you tell people that you're Cuban, not African American. Carve out your own place. Find your tribe" [ambient music] Trying to figure out where you fit in became a full-time job, so I became a citizen, dropped the accent. Joined the force. And that became my family, my tribe, my country. You found home. No, see, Leah was home. And somewhere along the way I forgot that. And I left them all behind, or they moved on. Still trying to figure out which. And was all of this even worth it? What you do is important. It's valuable. Now, that's just something we tell ourselves to make the sacrifices mean something. I stopped taking any promotional exams 'cause I didn't want to be sitting behind a desk, pushing papers; I needed to be out there on the street, chasing this killer. So Leah left. And we lose Julie. My best friend, Frank, he dies before we catch him. We save Amanda only to lose her. And you say I'm giving up. Hey, we get the Nightingale? Everything's different. [tense music] Not for me. You know, when you first start this job, it's what you do. But then somewhere along the way, if you're not careful, it becomes who you are. It's been six months, Frank. You said two. Listen, I'm close on this, all right? This is important. How close? A month? A year? Jules, I can't just walk away from this, all right? Not... not right now, okay? You're walking away from me. From Raimy. That's not fair. You just... you can't keep coming and going. It's too hard. Jules, I have to see this thing through. All right, we're close on this. I promise you, it's gonna be over soon. All right? And we can survive this. Hey, babe, you're not listening to me, okay? No, you're not listening to me. I love you, and I know you better than anyone, but this... I... this... I don't recognize this. Jules, come on. Jules. Oh, sweetheart. [dramatic whoosh] [ambient music] Can't say I never thought about this. Never thought it would actually happen. And it was incredible. [somber music] You got a lot going on, but this was good. We're good together. [soft brooding music] ♪ ♪ Stop. [eerie music] ♪ ♪ [tense music] ♪ ♪ Let's you and me get a couple of things straight. Number one, you ever go near my wife again, I will kill you. Wife, mistress, the Boy Scout Sullivan, how do you do it? Number two, Miracella won't be a problem anymore, so call off your dogs. It's taken care of. Like you're taking care of Julie? [scoffs] Look at you, man. You're defending some drug-dealing piece of tail better than your own wife. [groans] ♪ ♪ I know what you are. [elevator groans] And I know you set me up. It's your word against mine. And you're a lone wolf, man. Weight of the world on your shoulders. Word to the wise: outliers make people nervous. Thought you were smarter than that, Frank. [elevator groans] ♪ ♪ No, I'm just your average knuckle-dragger, Stan. Nothing for you to sweat, right? [elevator dings] [crickets chirping] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [glass cracks] ♪ ♪ Fun camp. ♪ ♪ [eerie music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ [gasps] Mother of... What you got? [suspenseful music builds] ♪ ♪ Everything. [indistinct radio chatter] Let's go, let's go. We got 34 years of files to comb through. I want to do pre-1989 in first, 1990 to '93 last. Keep it organized, people. You got it, Lieutenant. Good job. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ We got plenty of DNA from that room. And if it turns out to be Larissa Abbot, we might be looking at the Nightingale's very first victim. Larissa worked here in 1990 until it went bankrupt two years later. And two years after that, in '94, is when she was reported missing. So the Nightingale met her here, and then later held her here? Well, he is familiar with the place; he knows it's shut down. Look at this. Ars Moriendi? "The Art of Dying"" Medieval Christian text. I scanned one of the drawings from that room, been looking up what it means. "Prayers and rituals for a good death"? Here. Zip ties. Food wrappers. Someone was held in that room. All these religious artifacts. And the tub? If it was used as a baptismal font. [laughs] You're gonna have to come again. A sacrament to wash away sin. A person could be completely immersed in it. Cleansed. He was preparing someone for a good death. Salvation. So you're saying in his mind... The Nightingale thinks he's saving these women. [Hozier's "Sedated" playing] So in conclusion, I want to reiterate that this is a significant breakthrough in our hunt for this killer.

No matter what happens, we're celebrating right now. And right now, I am just so proud of you. That's love right there! [chuckles] And I love you, baby. Oh, that's special. Uh-huh. [crowd whooping] All right, hold up, hold up. 'Cause we know the real truth, all right? The truth is I wouldn't be standing here, none of us would be standing here if it wasn't for this lovely lady to my right. She allowed me to close the door, study up for this thing.

[speaking indistinctly] Cheers, everybody. Thank you. Smile. Thank you. [pensive string music] [radio static] I had these big ideas, you know, what I was gonna do when I went undercover. Being in it, it just  changed me. You remember much about that time? Some. I, uh,  I met someone when I was in the life. Miracella. Okay. It's a game, Raim. You know, you... you get them to trust me and then become someone you're not. How far can you push it? Same with Miracella. At first, she was just part of the life, and then,  pretty soon she was the life. What happened? I was so far gone. [soft orchestral music] It felt like she really got me, you know, better than anyone else, and then... you and your mom, I mean, you... you were like a dream. Just a dream I couldn't even get back to. Did you want to come back? Did I want... what? Yeah. Of course I wanted to come back. I mean, I was... I was messed up, but I did, I... I needed to. Hey, you got to hear me when I tell you that she was never the reason that I stayed in. Okay, it... it was always about the job, always. I believe you, Dad. But you have to convince Mom. Yeah, that's a whole other thing. You were my hero, but... you're also human. And so is she. Just try harder. You just... you start with this full head of steam, you know, thinking you can just change the world. When you start the job, it's what you do. Somewhere along the way, it becomes who you are. Yeah. But maybe it's not the job that defines you. Maybe it's because of who you are, you chose the job. What do you mean? You and me. We were made for this. Mom wanted me to be an astronaut. You gave me your knife. It's just how it is. What if who we are costs us everything we cherish the most?
