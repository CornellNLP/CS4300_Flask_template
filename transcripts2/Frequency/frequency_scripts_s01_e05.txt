 My name is Detective Raimy Sullivan. 
 My father was killed in 1996. [gunshot] Last night... [electricity sputters] [indistinct voice over radio] Hello? Hey. I spoke to him. Your father? Dad? So you're telling me that in 20 years,  I'm gonna be on the job with my daughter? No. You die tomorrow. [gun cocks] [gunshot] [grunts] [tires squeal] [gasps] Dad survived, but saving his life changed everything. We've ID'd the remain from the marsh. I'm sorry, Raimy, it's your mom. The most wanted serial killer in New York took my mom. Now whatever we do, however we try to fix things, history keeps changing. Your name is Daniel Lawrence. How do you know my name? I am your girlfriend. I've never been to Queens. And I don't know you. I'm sorry. All I want is to get back what I lost. Previously on "Frequency"... We did some... changed something. It was a setup. Don't trust Stan Moreno. You were shot and your own guy set you up. There was no sting. You were never supposed to survive. You lived but Mom died. How can you know this? Because I remember it both ways. Life when you died and life when you didn't. All I know is she's gone. [traffic honking] Looking for Lance. Well, you found him. I'm gonna keep this real simple. Curfew's 10:00 sharp. No drugs, no alcohol, no women. You break any of the rules, your ass is headed back to prison. We clear? Yeah. Think I got it. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [two gunshots] [thud] Hey. Hey. Satch just called me in on a fresh body. You're not gonna believe this one. Nightingale? Uh-uh. Heroin dealer named Benny Arcaro, who you and I locked up in 2008 on my first day on patrol. In 2008? So you're saying I'm gonna be your TO? Get out of here. Ha! Trust me, it's not as heartwarming as it sounds. Arcaro beat his girlfriend to death in their apartment uptown,  girl named Gina Vitale. He finishes eight years upstate this morning. Two hours later, he's found shot to death in a halfway house on Amsterdam. Sounds like a revenge killing. Ground ball, right? Maybe. But here's the really weird part. I remember that first day on patrol both ways. [ambient music] The one when you were killed and the one when we changed the timeline and you survived. But in the one when you were killed, my TO and I didn't arrest Arcaro. We never had the chance. We found him murdered, two shots to the back of the head. Weird, right? Yeah. So who... who was your TO when... when I was dead? ♪ ♪ Stan Moreno. Is tha... is that a joke? You were dead, Dad, and they told me you were dirty. Stan Moreno tried to kill me. I know that now. I was a rookie, and he was Stan Moreno. I actually looked up to the guy. So it was heartwarming. Nice. Look, Stan was a legend in a memory that only exists in my mind. To the rest of Earth, I rode with you, okay? Can we focus on the case, please? Look... maybe it's a good thing, you know? Two memories gives you two crime scenes, which gives you twice as much evidence. Like I said, it's a ground ball. [uneasy ambient music] [radio static] Hot shot rookie makes a homicide collar first day out of the box. Now look at you. Salty veteran riding out to the scene of the same perp's murder with a gold shield on her belt. Your pops would be proud. [chuckles] [static] I'll never forget that first roll call. You standing there at attention like a deer in headlights. SUV was spotted leaving the scene of the last job. Now let's keep our eyes open, all right? Hey, Serge, you got room for one more rookie over here? Look at this guy. [laughter] Surprised the suit still fits, my man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yuck it up, yuck it up. All right. Sullivan, where you at? Get your butt up here. Oh, yeah, you, come on down, don't be shy. I'm going to kill you. Well, that's no way to talk to your training officer, now is it? [laughs] Sorry, kid. NYPD tradition. You're stuck with the old man today. You follow in your daddy's footsteps, you get to spend your first day on the road with him. And I pulled some strings down at headquarters and got you your dad's old badge. [clapping] Remember to watch your back out there. It's a big moment for me, kiddo. Big moment. I'll try to make you proud. Trust me. You already have. All right, all right, enough of the sweet stuff. Y'all are gonna give me diabetes over here. [chuckling] Everybody fall back in so I can turn out this fearsome group of crime fighters. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [car honks] We have a dark, late model SUV [coin flips]  that was spotted leaving the scene of the last job. Let's keep our eyes open, and, as always, be safe out there. ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] He doesn't listen; I don't know what's wrong with him. Sullivan, hey, hey. Congratulations, kiddo. It's your first tour. It's a big deal. Look, I told you I was gonna ride out with you on your first day, but I'm buried in the task force. So, Sergeant Moreno here was nice enough to step up. Not sure if you remember me. Of course. Stan Moreno. Everyone knows who you are, sir. Ugh, please, don't call me sir. [both chuckle] Stan was your dad's handler in Narco back in the day. Nobody in the department was closer to him. And, uh, this was your dad's old shield. I had it put back in service just for you. Appreciate it, but I'm good with the one I have. I know a lot of things were said about your father, but... All due respect to both of you, this isn't about him so let's not make it. Copy that. Let's hit the street. Good luck. [whoosh] [brooding music] [police radio chatter] What you got? Crime scene found tool marks on the doorjamb. Someone broke in and was waiting for him inside. Any surveillance footage? No cameras in the building, limited coverage outside. Manager heard two shots. By the time he got inside, shooter had gone out the window. [uneasy ambient music] ♪ ♪ Your first collar. Bring back any nostalgic memories from eight years ago? [camera snapping] ♪ ♪ Two bullets to the back of the head. [coin flips] ♪ ♪ You and I arrested Arcaro that day. But when I rode with Stan, we found Arcaro murdered in the exact way I found him this morning. So you think it's the same shooter? Maybe. Both times the shooter knew where to find him. And what about the girl's family, you looking there? Of course. But I'd rather not be looking at any of this. Where are we with the Nightingale? Five days until he takes his next victim. [ambient music] You watching her? And your mother. She's gotta love that. Thought you were supposed to be giving her her space? She's getting all the space she needs, trust me. Things have changed. Raims, in the last two years, I mean, your mother's changed. Yeah, but can you blame her? Oh, give it a rest. I'm... I'm just trying to get to know your mom again, find something that will connect her to the other victims. Something that will lead us to this animal. Okay. What? Nothing, I get it. Just, you know, don't be an idiot. Oh, thanks. What are we gonna do today? Play hard. And what else are we gonna do? Most important thing? Have fun. Okay, remember everything I told you guys, it's about teamwork, communication, paying attention. Raimy. Hi! Kick butt. Hey. Hey. How are ya? Me? I'm... I'm getting by, you know. I mean, I'm good, you know. It's just good to be back in the human race again. It's good to have you back. All right, guys. Bring it in. Thanks. Bayside on three. One, two, three. All : Bayside! I know this isn't easy. All of us not together under the same roof. No, I know, it is what it is. You know, I mean, we'll do whatever it takes and we'll make it work. It's good. You, uh, you can still take Raims after the game, yeah? So I can get to class. Oh, yeah, I had my secretary clear my schedule. [both chuckle] So tell me, when do I get to start calling you Dr. Sullivan? Mmm, not for a while. Don't worry. Oh, I can't wait. Oh, me too. Play ball! All right. Let's go, kiddo! Whoo-hoo! [upbeat tone] [sighs] Eight years and a man-1 plea deal is a damn generous sentence for a guy with Arcaro's rap sheet. Well, either he ratted someone out or he had a real good lawyer. Public defender. He never made a statement. [scoffs] Somebody got him that deal. [chuckles] Look at this. Dynamic duo. You know, for weeks, all Frank could talk about was taking you out on your first day. The guy was a basket case. Proud as hell one minute, terrified the next. Really? I remember him being a total hard ass. [chuckles] Hey. Tape from that day. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ 911 operator, what is your emergency? I'm at 1274 West 86th. Y'all got to get over here real quick. There's a dude beating down his lady real bad. [static] 21 Sector Eddie, come in to Central. Nah-ah, you drive; I talk. 21 Eddie, go. 21 Eddie, possible assault in progress at 1274 West 86th, apartment 2-George. 10-4, Central, show us responding. [sirens wailing] Hey, hey, slow down. All right, we're not gonna help anybody if we don't get there. What the hell, Dad? Calm down. It's "What the hell, Detective Sullivan?" [dramatic music] Hey, hey, hey, get you hand off that gun. It doesn't come out until I say so. Yeah, I got it; you don't have to talk to me like I'm 12. And what are you gonna do at the door? I know what to do at the door. [tense music] ♪ ♪ I'll clear. You get her. Central, this is 21 Eddie. We need an ambulance here right away. 10-4, 21 Eddie, an ambulance is en route to your location. We're clear. ♪ ♪ You should take over. No, you've got it. Keep going. [uneasy ambient music] ♪ ♪ [panting] You can stop, Raimy. Raimy. Raimy, stop. It's over. She's gone. [somber piano music] ♪ ♪ [whoosh] ♪ ♪ Way to go, ladies! Way to go! Whoo! Okay, I gotta run. You got Mookie Wilson? I got her. Go. Okay. Go. See you. [indistinct chatter] ♪ ♪ Hey, kiddo! Come here, you. [groans] God, you were so good. Did you see my double? You had a hit? I had three hits. I'm just kidding you. Of course you did. That... that hit you had at right field, that was a bomb. You're amazing. Except when I dropped that pop-up. Oh, can of corn. I mean, look, hey, I'm not gonna lie, you should have had it, but, bah. Coach says I need a new glove. He says Modell's has the new A2000 I was telling you about. Oh, yeah? Okay. Let me see that thing, huh. [sniffs] Yeah. You do need a new... I'll tell you what. First thing this weekend, we're gonna take you and get you one, okay? Okay. All right. I have to go help clean out the dugout. Well, then go. I got you. I'll meet you at the car, okay? Okay. [children playing] [uneasy ambient music] ♪ ♪ [sighs] After eight years upstate, Arcaro isn't exactly on his way to becoming a brain surgeon. I mean, I hate that we're pulling resources from the Nightingale for this. Raimy made the original collar back in '08. I get it, but how do we get her back to doing God's work as fast as we can? What's the plan? We go after the revenge angle. We look at Gina's family, who... [phone ringing] I'm sorry. Hold that thought. I gotta take this. [phone ringing] Sorry. [phone beeps] Yeah? [tense music building] I know, that's what I said. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Central, this is 21 Eddie. We need an ambulance at this location. 10-4, 21 Eddie, an ambulance is en route to your location. ♪ ♪ You know her? No. Keep going. ♪ ♪ I could use a hand here. [plastic rustles] Good job in there. Put us back in service. [whoosh] Okay. All right, bye. All right, look. We haven't had a chance to run backgrounds on Gina's family yet. Now, if that doesn't pan out, we work our way out to former cell mates, past arrest associates. Satch, this kid was a piece of garbage. Okay, if we swing and miss... Yeah... On something like this, no one loses any sleep over it. Okay, let's not waste any more time here. Is there any chance you know her, boss? [suspenseful music] Arcaro's vic, Gina Vitale? Why would I know her? ♪ ♪ How 'bout him? [dramatic music] [chuckles] Why are you showing me these photos? All right, look, Arcaro was moving product in a neighborhood back in your Narco days. We just figured that maybe you ran across these two at some point. [sighs] Let me see the other one. [suspenseful music] Nope. And I never forget a face. ♪ ♪ Alpha, yellow, boy, 930. Aren't you with Raimy? The hell you doing running a plate? There was this guy at the field, he was acting all hinky with Jules. This guy was just hanging at the field? He was Raimy's coach, okay? Have you lost your damn mind? What happened to giving Julie her space? Just run the plates. [sighs] [train passing overhead] Stan's an encyclopedia of scumbags. He knows every lowlife in the neighborhood. And he doesn't know them? So what's the difference? Stan has nothing to do with the Arcaro case. Well, then why lie? Why are you so sure he is? Call it a hunch. Oh. She has a hunch, whoa... whoa, hold on now, then that settles it. You know who else had crazy hunches? I'll give you a hint. You and him share the same last name. [ominous music] Are you here as a courtesy or to ask me if I did it? Both. Mr. Vitale, where were you at 7:30 this morning? Sleeping, in bed with my wife. Snoring his damn head off. Can you arrest him for that? Look, I'm not gonna lie. Eight years ago, if you put a gun in my hand I would have killed that kid. And I probably would have regretted it the rest of my life. Your dad was the only reason I didn't do it. [static] [ominous music] Hold up. Pull yourself together. Can you cut me a little slack, please? This isn't about you. I'm sorry, okay? I've never done this before, I... I don't know what to say to someone who's just lost a daughter. You say what you want someone to say to you if you'd just lost someone. What happened? What's wrong? ♪ ♪ 
 
 I'm so sorry, ma'am. Your daughter... we believe she was murdered. Liar. No, you're a liar. No, honey, no. Liar... No. No. [sobbing] It was that animal Arcaro, wasn't it? ♪ ♪ Mr. Vitale, you have my word, if Arcaro is guilty, he's gonna pay for what he did to Gina. [sniffling] Your dad kept his word. [whoosh] But eight years? For my daughter's life? Maybe today that punk finally got what he deserved. [coin flips] [ominous tone] Something on your mind? No. Good. Go wait in the car. I'll be out in a few minutes. Nicky. [hushed] There was some sort of an accident. What? [indistinct] Yes? She's gone. What? She's gone. No, no, no... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [indistinct] Come on, take Mrs. Vitale... [crying] [indistinct talking] He's a dead man walking! Shh! I'm gonna kill him! You need to calm down. We're gonna make this right, I promise you. But we gotta be smart about it, we gotta be smart. [whoosh] You know, first you accuse Stan, and now the Vitales? There's no way that they did Arcaro. They have too much to lose. They already lost the only thing that really mattered. They have another daughter. And eight years dulls a lot of pain. Nothing dulls that kind of pain. I'm gonna subpoena their phone records, run their financials. [sighs] Boy, here we go again. Another hunch, huh? It's not a hunch. They're lying. [country music over radio] I'm gonna steal some of your ketchup. Oh, look at you. Got it. [chuckles] ♪ ♪ Daddy? When are you and Mommy gonna be done taking a break? ♪ ♪ I don't know, sweetheart. You see, sometimes, people, they... they gotta take some time away from each other to realize that they love each other. Does that make sense? No? Hey, you know what? I haven't seen you play in a dog's age. You've gotten really good. Coach Ted must be a good coach, huh? He plays catch with me when he comes over to visit Mom. Oh, yeah? Huh. Yeah. And, uh, how... how often... how often does he... he, uh does he come over? I don't know. What do you... what do you mean, you don't know? I mean, what is it, like, one... one time? Some... twice a week? I'm not sure. Raimy, it's not that hard of a question. How often does he come over? Why are you getting so mad? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [exhales] You want to form a Coach Ted Task Force, you knock yourself out, but I promise you, he's not the one coming to take Mom. [radio static] So did you wrap up this Arcaro thing yet? I think Stan knows more than he's saying. He knew all the players. He took drugs from Arcaro's place and delivered them to Nicky. And that you're gonna prove how? I... it never happened except in your memory, right? [radio static] Yeah. Which is what makes it so damn hard. [radio static] I need to make a connection  between Stan and Nicky Vitale. Tie him to this kill. If we can do that, we're golden, we can bury Stan. Nicky was dealing heroin all over the hood. Now, I didn't know him, but maybe Stan did. So, uh, I'll do some digging around. And hey, do not underestimate Stan Moreno. He's a snake. Don't worry, I'll be careful. [office phones ringing] Come on, I taught you better than that. [static] Huh, if you're gonna go bacon cheeseburger, then you gotta go all-in with the fries and the shake. Gonna tell me how to eat now too? Oh. [chuckles] You think I'm being hard on you, huh? I think you're being a total dick, yeah. You're gonna thank me for it one day. What do you think Mom would think about all this? [ambient music] Ah, your mother. [chuckles] She had big dreams for you. Astronaut, doctor. Then I had to go and screw it all up. What are you talking about? ♪ ♪ I just hope you're doing it for the right reasons. You think I'm doing this because of what happened to Mom? You're an idiot. Yeah. I became a cop because of you. [scoffs] [ambient music building] Be honest. Do you think I have what it takes? ♪ ♪ I don't think it matters what I think. You're gonna have to. [cell phone rings] This is Sullivan. Got it, yeah. Hey? I owe you one. Yeah. [phone beeps] It was my CI. He got an address on Arcaro. We gotta roll. [whoosh] [keys clacking] [uneasy ambient music] ♪ ♪ [whoosh] Thank you. Next. Do you like halal? No clue. Really? I love this stuff. You know they bless it before they kill it? Seriously? Yeah. So, Sullivan, what kind of cop you want to be, huh? I don't know. A good cop. What other kind of cop is there? There's your dad. Don't get me wrong. At one time, Frank was a good cop, but... he forgot who he was. Lost his way. Let me tell you what a good cop is. She's feared. She's respected. She knows when to keep her eyes open and her mouth shut. And no matter what, she doesn't turn on her people. You understand what I'm saying to you? [ominous music] Yeah. You know, I see those qualities in you one day in. I'm impressed. [cell phone rings] Moreno. Okay, got it. No, you did real good. All right, let's go. We might have a location on Arcaro. [tense music] All right, come on. You're gonna go in first. He gives you any excuse to put him down, you take it. I got your back. [whoosh] ♪ ♪ I'm going in first. ♪ ♪ Okay, listen to me. Hey. As soon as you get in there you find cover, do you hear me? What if I can't actually shoot someone? I'd rather have you find out with me standing next to you. [static] Look at me. We got each other, okay? Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6. [door breaks open] Police! Get down on the ground! [dramatic music] [indistinct talking over TV] ♪ ♪ Gun! ♪ ♪ [grunts] Get down. [handcuffs rattle] [handcuffs click] [grunts] See, it ain't that tough, Sullivan, huh? [door breaks open] [tense ominous music] ♪ ♪ Who says the wheels of justice turn slowly? [chuckles] [static whoosh] [keys clacking] [both chuckling] [brooding music] ♪ ♪ Not only do I think Stan knows Nicky, I think he gave him the wink and the nod to go to that hotel and kill Arcaro. And you know this how? Did you not see the way he looked at those photos? He knew them. And then he practically told you to dump the case. What was that? Is that all you got? There are other things. What things? When? Where? You act like Stan Moreno is some pillar of the community. You were here when Little Jay and his crew almost killed my dad; you want to talk about the failed op? Better check yourself, young lady. That's the CO of this precinct you're talking about. Come on, Satch. Don't you Satch me. You come in here talking like that with nothing to back it up? It's Lieutenant Reyna. Now get the hell out of my office. You know who and what Stan is, and you still defend him. What does that make you? Out. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [indistinct office chatter] [chuckles] There he is! [slow clapping] The man. Boy, I'm lucky to know you. Congratulations, Frank. You cracked the Nightingale case. I'm not in the mood. Oh, really? Well, me neither. But I did run that plate for you. So the next time you see Marine Corporal Ted Cardenas, you make sure you walk up to him, shake his hand, and thank him for his service. He was fighting in Iraq when the second Nightingale victim was taken. I was wrong, okay? Yeah. "Richard Jewell, summer Olympics" wrong. Did I happen to mention that Ted was also an EMT? Let me give you some unsolicited advice, my friend. Give Jules her space, or we're gonna wind up signing a long-term lease on my garage. Thank you. Thank you... is the victory lap done here?

You don't think I know what this is, Jules? Huh, you and him? Hey, it's not like that, pal. I'm not your pal, all right? My daughter doesn't need a new glove from you... Hey, hey, hey, hey.

You see, Stan had a slam dunk, A-1 felony possession case on Nicky. He was looking at a minimum of 15 years. The only way those charges go away and the case gets sealed is if Nicky became Stan's CI. ♪ ♪ Whoa. [dramatic tone] What? Red Scorpion was Nicky's brand. If Arcaro was working for him, that's how Arcaro met Gina. So Nicky intro'd his daughter to her killer. And if Nicky was Stan's CI, it had to have been Stan who tipped him off to Arcaro's location both times. Okay, okay, slow down. All right, I want to nail Stan as bad as you do, but that doesn't change anything. I mean, the only evidence we have are memories from a reality that doesn't exist and... and files that got destroyed 20 years ago. But there's got to be a way to use this against him. Or...  we use it to nail Nicky and we get him to turn on Stan. [dramatic music building] ♪ ♪ [lock clicks] [door opens] Mrs. Vitale, we need to have a talk about your husband.

And why the sudden change of heart? I told her Arcaro met Gina selling drugs for Nicky. And once I convinced her that Nicky was the reason Gina got sucked into the drug life, it was fish on. And how, pray tell, did this new information come to light? Does it matter? Is he talking? He fessed up to killing Arcaro, but he didn't want to talk about Stan. [scoffs] Maybe... because Stan had nothing to do with it. Or maybe because he's terrified of him. We're not doing the Stan dance again. Why can't you just be happy with the guy who pulled the trigger? Because the more dangerous man got away. [door opens] [door shuts] Congratulations. That's no picnic, getting a wife to turn on her partner. Any tips for an old dog? It's hard to say what motivates people. Love, fear, maybe a little of both. And maybe I just got lucky.

Don't say anything. Just listen. I get it. Okay? But you have to know, I would never let anyone come between you and Raimy. Never. When you were away, it was simple. It was just me and Raims. And I understand this isn't what you imagined coming back to, but at this point, we owe it to Raimy to be the best parents we can be. Yes. Apart. It's over, Frank. I'm sorry, but it's over...
