 My name is Detective Raimy Sullivan. 
 My father was killed in 1996. Last night... WQ2YV... Hello? Hey. I spoke to him. Your father? Dad? So you're telling me that in 20 years I'm gonna be on the job with my daughter? No. You die tomorrow. [gasps] Dad survived, but saving his life changed everything. We've ID'd the remains from the marsh. I'm sorry, Raimy, it's your mom. The most wanted serial killer in New York took my mom. Now, whatever we do, however we try to fix things, history keeps changing. Your name is Daniel Lawrence. How do you know my name? I'm your girlfriend. I've never been to Queens, and I don't know you. I'm sorry. All I want is to get back what I lost. Previously on "Frequency"... Meghan thinks that Joe killed her brother, too. She's blaming herself. So you believe her now? 'Cause that's what Meghan was trying to tell me, that the deacon murdered her family. That he's the Nightingale. You gotta find this Meghan girl. I couldn't concentrate at all today. Kept playing the night over and over in my head. Pornographic, really. Really? Stan had to get rid of me, right? He set me up to die in that shipyard. So you're saying that Stan Moreno put a hit out on you. I trusted you with my life. You're my partner. How could you rat me out? You think he has Meghan? I heard it in her voice. She's running from someone. Do not go in there alone. Meghan begged me for help. And she would've called back if she could, but something stopped her. [both grunting] [gunshot] [groaning] Deacon Joe is the Nightingale. And now I'm gonna kill him. [electric razor buzzing] [indistinct TV chatter] The Mayor's office is offering a $100,000 reward for any information leading to the capture of Deacon Joseph Hurley, the man dubbed "The Nightingale Killer." He's believed to be responsible for the murders of more than 20 women in a reign of terror, dating back more than two decades. Police are also endeavoring to locate Hurley's stepdaughter, Meghan Womack, who's been missing since Wednesday. Anyone with... This is what happens when you start telling your stories. ♪ ♪ [radio static] ♪ ♪ [quiet music] ♪ ♪ Thanks for, um... thanks for being there for me last night. Of course. It's you. [chuckles] Let's just get out of here. Let's go someplace else and start over. Leave Bayside? Leave Bayside. You can be a nurse anywhere, right? I can be a cop somewhere else. Maybe, I don't know... open an auto body shop. Oh, Frankie, it's not that easy. I mean, there are... you know, there are things that we kinda need to talk about. No, I know there's things we need to talk about. [knocking] Hi! Hey! What's up, kiddo? Daddy? Hi. Are you living with us again? Am I... Uh, we... uh, um... No, Mommy and I, we just had a, uh... we had a sleepover. Yeah, I just faxed over a DA's subpoena for any and all records you have pertaining to your patient Meghan Womack. That includes taped therapy sessions, psych evaluations, everything. Great, I'll be over in an hour to come get them. Thanks. An hour? I was hoping we can stay right here. As tempting as that sounds, I think we both know that's not happening. Yeah. No, you've got a serial killer to catch. I've got a heart to crush. Please don't joke about that. You put that ring on her finger. That wasn't trying to be funny. I spent half the night trying to figure out how to do this. And? [scoffs] Supposed to have dinner tomorrow night. Just tell her the truth. You owe her that. [sighs] Why don't you just kill me like all those other women? [sighs] I didn't kill those women. You're a liar. I've asked you not to say that. I know what you are. You killed my mother and my brother and all those women. You're a monster. Meghan, all I've ever tried to do is to help you. It's just you and me now. But if I have to save you... if I am forced to save you... I'll make sure you die a good death. Leah told me you were moving out. Hey, Frank, look, man... This thing with Stan, it's... it's way more complicated than you think. Seems pretty simple to me. Had a chance to put him on tape, to bury him, and you tipped him off. Don't tell me it's some sort of mistake... lack of judgment. It's a lack of loyalty, Satch, to me. To your friend. And what was Miracella? Don't come preaching to me about loyalty. Come on, man. I don't wanna hear it. All right? You showed me who you are. And I get it, yeah, man. Loud and clear. We got nothing else to talk about. WQ2YV, come in. Dad, you there? Yeah. Yeah, I'm here. You sound terrible. Thanks. Listen, I, um, I've been doing some digging  on the Deacon, okay? And, uh, he's a creature of habit. Makes sense. He works at the ConEd plant in Midtown. He's up and out of the house every morning, 5:00 sharp. He leaves the plant around 2:00, heads over to St. Abigail's on the West Side, where he works clerical and accounting stuff for the parish. Heads out of there around 5:00, he's home by 6:00, 6:30. Has some dinner, watches TV. Then he locks up and lights out by 10:00. So what's the plan? It goes down tomorrow night. I'm gonna drive up there around 5:30, when it gets dark, park the car a couple blocks away. And traffic cams? We're all good once I get off the highway. Did you check for alarms? Yeah, there's none. And no locks or nothing fancy there, so I'm gonna get in there, I'm gonna pack a suitcase, make it look like he skipped town real quick. How are you actually gonna do it? Don't worry about it. I'll figure it out. You can't figure this out on the fly, Dad. You have to plan for everything. You have to be perfect. Yeah, for the last two years, every day I was perfect. My life depended on it. That's a terrible example. You got shot. Yeah, because Stan set me up, Raimy, not because I made a mistake. Are you okay with this? Tomorrow night... I'm gonna walk another human being into the woods and I am gonna shoot him in the back of the head and I'm gonna dump his body in a ditch. And I can't stop thinking about what that's gonna look like. Dad, stop. You need to get out of your own head. I saw it with my own eyes. His wife in his house. Rosaries around her wrists and feet. The only way to change history and to save Mom is to cut the tree at the trunk. He's gonna take her,  and you are going to stop him. Hey. I hope this is okay. Knock yourself out. My home is your man cave, apparently. Well, Laurel came home from school Thursday and went "Sopranos" on the flat screen with a Wiffle ball bat, trying to kill a fly. I got a guy coming to fix it. When are they home from Grandma's? Tuesday. Full disclosure, I do have a plus one on the way. Not Stewie. I can't have that guy creeping on my stuff. It's my dad. He just landed at JFK. Um... Why is he in town? Clearly not to see his granddaughter. Work? Who the hell knows. Do me a favor. Try and keep the peace this time. Yeah, trust me. There's enough booze in that thing to have us both blackout drunk by halftime. We'll be fine. What time are you coming home? To my own house? To run interference. Plan B. You know, he's more excited to see you than he is me, anyways. I don't know. Late. Hey, be safe out there. Text me the score. Hey. Wow. You are pulling out all the stops, Sullivan. Gourmet cafeteria coffee and flowers from the gift shop. You know me. Go big or go home, right? [laughs] Thank you. You're welcome. How did it go with Satch? Not good. Not good, but it's cool, you know? I'm gonna stay at a hotel until I find another place. Hey, don't be so dramatic. You can stay on the couch until you find something, okay? What do we, um... what do we tell Raimy? Well, for now, let's just say that you can't stay at Satch's. Yeah. About Raimy, um... this morning was... No, no, I totally get that. That was... I... I don't wanna confuse her. One step at a time. Okay? One step. First step, you get to see her on clarinet tomorrow night at the Winter Concert. I can make dinner and we'll go over to the school together. Yeah, I can't. I can't tomorrow. One step forward and two steps back. No, no, no. It's not like that. Jules, it's not, it's just that I... This is work. And if I could bail on it I would, but I can't, and... Jules, I'm... I'm tired of making promises that I can't keep. But you always seem to keep them for work. Look, I get it. I don't have to like it, but I get it. [alarm beeping] Duty calls. I'll see you later, Detective. You just can't help yourself, can you? What happened to going home and getting some rest? I'll sleep when I'm dead. Which almost happened last night. How are you feeling? I'm fine. What'd I miss? Well, the tip lines are burning up. But so far, no credible sightings of the Deacon or Meghan. He did manage to clean out the safe at St. Abigail's. Got about 15 grand. So he's got gun money. Uh-huh. Can I get a copy of those reports? Sure. Knock yourself out. What is this? Meghan's records from Langdon Psychiatric. She's been in and out of that place for 25 years. Goes back to the early '90s. [sighs] Seems like a pretty deep dive. I don't know. Maybe there's something here about prior addresses, acquaintances. Maybe just some insight into who this guy is. Seems like a needle in a haystack to me. I have to do something. I can't just sit here, answering phones. She could be out there, suffering. She could've died trying to find me. I owe it to her to keep going. All right. I get it. Just... just let me know if you find anything. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ You'll never get away with it, Sullivan. [both laugh] Ah, well. Guess I'd better be careful, then 'cause you can't find a good defense attorney in this town. Oh, is that right? I know one or two. Big Gordo, Little Gordo, how you doing? Hey, whatever you do, do not follow in your old man's footsteps, okay? Oh, you better. You know you will. [laughs] This guy. What's going on with this Sammy the Bull starter kit you got here? What? I finally get around to painting my daughter's room and now my neighbor thinks I'm a hit man. Here, here. Does this make you feel better? Ah, good, you give a lawyer something to work with that way. Okay, okay. Hey, it's good to see you, man, but I gotta get running. All right? But we're long overdue for a bourbon and a cigar in the backyard. Oh, yeah. Let's do that sometime. Hey, you watch this guy, okay? [sighs] Why don't you believe in God, Meghan? God wouldn't let Joe do the things he did. The things you saw and heard before you began taking your medicine may have seemed very real, but they weren't. They were real. Only in your mind. The police have looked into it. They filed reports. And your mom and brother have told them on several occasions that the Deacon's been nothing but kind to you and your family. Now why would he lie about that? He controls them. He controls all of us. Meghan. The Deacon has dedicated his life to helping others. Why would he wanna hurt you? Because he thinks he's saving us. Saving you? From who? From ourselves. [whipping, screaming] [whimpering] [whipping, screaming] Help me. [crying] Stand up. If we confess our sins... I won't let him hurt you. [whipping, screaming] ...he is faithful and just, and will forgive us of our sins. And purify us from all unrighteousness. I'm not gonna let him hurt you. I'm not gonna let him hurt you, okay? [door opens] [crying] [exhaling deeply] Who wants to go into town and get some ice cream? [whistling] It was real. I remember it. Mom said you're not coming to my concert. [sighs] [slaps legs] Okay, that's it. I can't stand to see you sad. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm gonna call work right now. I'm gonna tell them I quit, you know, and we're gonna sell this house. We're gonna sell all your toys, and we're gonna live in a tent in a park, and we're gonna eat rabbits and we're gonna eat squirrels. And it's gonna get cold in the wintertime, and tough. But you know what? We are Sullivans and we... Stop. [laughs] Okay, okay. I'm sorry. But why can't you just come for a little while? Because I... I gotta work all night, kiddo. But I tell you what, how about tomorrow, I'm gonna come over after school, and I'm gonna pick you up and I'm gonna take you for some ice cream, huh? Can we? Yeah, we can. You swear? I pinky swear you. Now go on, get out of here. You gotta get ready. [door opens, closes] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [pop music] ♪ ♪ Morning. Hi. I'll have one of those phones, please. Yeah, sure. [bell rings] Uh, which one? They all look the same, but they're all a little different, too. I mean, this one's got a bigger screen... Uh, it doesn't matter, really. I'll take that one. Yeah, all right. Good choice. So where are you from? Uh, just up the road. Cool. All you cops hunting this Nightingale guy for over 20 years, and not one of you can catch him yet. It's pretty pathetic, if you ask me. That's why no one's asking you, Walt. But thanks for playing. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 [door shuts] I know you think I'm crazy. I don't think you're crazy, Meghan. You're not well, but... [laughs] No. That's what he wants you to believe. He's got you all fooled. When I graduated from college, I got this job pumping gas out on the old road. There was this drive-thru burger place directly across the street. One night, this guy rolls up to the pumps... For the sake of the children in the room, I will say he abused the spirits and was away with the fairies. [laughter] The fairies. So he rolls down his window, he looks me in the eye and he says, "I need two cheeseburgers, a fries, and a shake." [laughter] What did you do, honey? What could I do? I said, "Coming right up." Then I walked inside and I called the Sheriff. [laughter] Oh, I love that. [sighs] Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. Robbie. It's okay, Robbie. It was an accident. The officer was a friend of Joe's. He felt worse for Robbie than he did for the stain on his uniform. Joe was mad. Real mad, but... I'm sorry. But I saw it. It's okay, Robbie. It was an accident. Yeah, that's okay, son. Clothes can be cleaned up and there's plenty of wine. He always said that he wanted us to be perfect, but he lived for the imperfections. Saw them as opportunities  to teach us. You know what? You know, I think we'll give your mom a break this weekend. Take a ride up to the cabin. We could use some time alone to do some praying. The cabin was in a beautiful place. Nothing but trees and mountains. And the shed. That's where Joe took us to be healed. He delivered us from the power of darkness, and... and in... in whom we have redemption... No. "He delivered us from the power of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son. in whom we have redemption." Start again. Look at me. Start again. In Him we have redemption... Start again! In Him we have redemption by his blood. [whimpers] In... in accord with... Stop. [crying] [sighs] Go back to the cabin. Go on. [metal rattling] [leather creaking] [grunting, whipping] Ow! Ow! [grunting, whipping] [whimpering] When he was done beating us, he would quote Proverbs 13:24. "Whoever spares the rod hates his son, He really did think he was teaching us. I protected Robbie the best I could. When I was brought here that next summer, I knew Robbie wasn't strong enough to go it alone. I knew Joe would kill him. [cassette player clicks] Hey. You remember anything about the Deacon owning a property upstate with a cabin and a shed? No. I'll have the guys look into it. Listen, Kyle Mosbey, he's been in an accident. Vehicle pursuit. How bad? We don't know yet. He's in surgery at Bronxdale. Dr. Davis to the ER. Dr. Davis to the ER. Sullivan. You don't write. You don't call. I'm glad you're okay. Look at her. She's beautiful. Look at those eyes. You know, that's what got me. Wasn't even fair. Joann Mosbey. Kyle's mom. Raimy Sullivan. Nice to meet you. How is he, apart from losing his inhibitions? Concussion, bruised ribs, broken arm, but he'll live. And that mushy stuff is nothing I haven't heard before. He's been talking you up around the table at Sunday dinners with the family. Oh. Really? Said you gave him butterflies, first time he saw you walk in the room. Oh, come on, Mom. Don't tell her that. You should join us one day when Kyle's feeling better. No, she doesn't do dinners. Attachment issues. [indistinct TV chatter] No, you have to do it. Jets got crushed. How many lawyers does it take? Go Rangers. Who's he talking to? Nicky No Socks. Tommy Two Chins. Who the hell knows? He's been on that thing all day. It's billable hours, son. Just call me when you're done, all right? Hey. Get over here. Come here. Ahh, oh. Oh, it's good to see you. [exhales] How you holding up, huh? I'm hanging in. Yeah, the Nightingale's heating up, huh? Matter of time now. I'm so proud of you, Raimy, you know? You're following in Frank's footsteps, you're working your way up the ranks. It's impressive. You're making a difference in the world, you know? Unlike me, who's wasting his Georgetown law degree to be a stay-at-home dad. Come on, Gordo. He didn't mean it like that. Yeah, he did. It's that, uh, passive aggressive thing that he likes to do all the time. Who is it you remind me of, again? Oh, yeah, that's right, every single lady on "The View." [laughs] And you wonder why Mom didn't want to have s*x with you. But who cares, right? To hell with her. She starts to lose her shine and you turn her in for something a little bit shinier. Means moving away from your kids. Bonus, right? Oh, you wanna do this now? Yeah, we could do this. All right. Yeah, I'm not perfect. And yeah, I was a little disappointed that you put aside your law degree... which I paid for, by the way... so you could wipe butts and play Mommy and Me in the park. Forgive me, I was expecting something a little bigger. Raising your granddaughter isn't big enough? I'm done here. She's all yours, counselor. [door slams] [sighs] I'm sorry. It's a rough day, you know? Jets lost, you'd think he'd be used to it. [laughs] He gets his beer balls on... Ah. I'm not taking sides. But Gordo is an amazing father. He has a smart, beautiful, super successful wife who happily supports the family. You should be proud of him. I am. Then tell him. Don't go back to D.C. like this. Yeah, I'm not going back to D.C. Carly threw me out. I know. Looking for something shinier, right? Have you told Gordo? Don't let your pride get in the way. He's mad at you, sure. But he'll forgive you. Come on. Get some rest, take him to breakfast. Make it right. Tomorrow, things will be different. [shovel scraping] [breathing heavily] [cell phone rings] Hey. Hey, I know you're at work, we don't wanna bug you, but Raims just wanted to say good night. Yeah, no, no. Not... not at all. Go ahead. Put her on. Here he is. I made your bed on the couch, Daddy. [laughs] Thanks, kiddo. What are you doing? I'm just standing outside. Staring at the moon. Hey, why don't you go to the window? Look outside, see if you can see it. There it is. I see it. [laughs] Right? You see, now we're together. Just you and me. We're staring at this moon. I love you, Daddy. I love you too, sweetheart. Good night. The combination is 91-36-95. The safe's in the Deacon's office, inside the rectory. So you're trying to tell me this is the same safe with the same combo in the same office  for the last 20 years? That's what the pastor told me and he's been there since the '70s. Nothing much changes with the Catholic church. So I'm just... I'm supposed to go in there and just clean this place out. It'll look like he took the money and skipped town, just like he did today. It's not like you're knocking over the Federal Reserve. Two years under cover, I think you can handle it. So it's not bad enough that I'm killing a man in cold blood. Now I'm robbing a collection box. I know this goes against everything you are, but think about what he did to Mom. We're doing the right thing here. You sure about that, kiddo? I mean, I get it. Nightingale dies, Mom lives. But I mean, think about it. What else does that change, you know? What if... what if we make things worse? I mean, what if Daniel doesn't know you? He'll know me. Certain things are meant to be. I'm sure of that now. What about that other guy? The guy that was there the other morning? His name is Kyle Mosbey. There's a lot more to him than I thought. It's funny. In another life, I could actually see myself with him. You'd like him. So would Mom. Sound like some real feelings there. Yeah, well. After tonight it won't matter. And even if he doesn't remember me, I'll remember him. And that'll have to be good enough. You know, if I do this right,  you're gonna be able to tell your mother all about this. If we do this right, I'll be able to have  awkward and awful boyfriend conversations with both of you. [laughs] I love you, Dad. Please be careful. Be perfect. And come home. You hear me? Hey, kiddo, I'm sorry again that I'm not gonna make it tonight. It's okay, Daddy. The bribe worked. Oh, did it? Good. Good to know. Listen, you just play that clarinet tonight like I know you can. And you're gonna be great, okay? Okay. Now come on. Let's get you inside. Gimme a hug. Mwah. Love you, baby. Love you, Daddy. Someone got ice cream? Yeah. Lucky duck. Oh, hey, kiddo. You be perfect tonight. Start your homework, please. Hi. Hi. Hey. You okay? Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm good. It's just this thing at work, you know? It's um... Is it the Nightingale? You know what? I don't wanna know. Be careful. Come home. [cell phone ringing] Hey, there. Listen, I'm not  trying to confuse you any more than I already have. But... don't tell her tonight. Are you having second thoughts? No, no. Not even a little bit. She deserves one more nice dinner with you. Raimy, I... I'm sorry. I don't have time to explain. Just trust me. It'll all make sense tomorrow. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Hey. How are you feeling? More embarrassed than sore in this particular moment. I know I said some things. And my mom, you know, she never should have... Shut up. [curtains squeaking] Tell me about this dinner I'm coming to. What's on the menu? Who's gonna be there? Tell me everything. Well, Sundays are all about the Italian side of my family. Mom's gravy and meatballs. Pork and sausage. And the wine. My family likes the wine. And the pasta. When we eat, my grandparents are there. [door unlocking] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [sighs] ♪ ♪ [screams] [both grunting] [screaming] [cell phone ringing] Satch, what's up? A call just came into  the tip line from a burner phone. A woman who says that she's Meghan. We're pinging the signal now. Now it's hard to hear her, but she just keeps repeating herself. I'm gonna hang up and have them transfer the call to you. [phone beeps] I'm at 138 Morewood Road in Harriman Village. Please help me. My name is Meghan Womak. I'm at 138 Morewood Road... Meghan? In Harriman Village. Meghan, can you hear me? Meghan? Please help me. My name is Meghan Womack... Meghan, are you there... [Phone call ends] I'm going. I'm in the Bronx, I'm halfway there. We traced the signal to the Morewood address. The property is owned by the church. It has a cabin and a shed. Yeah, it's the place she talked about on the tapes. I'll notify local PD and have them keep eyes on the place until we get there. We got him, Raim. It's been 20 years. And I wanna be standing right next to you when you slap the cuffs on that son of a bitch. This is for your mom. What happened? First car on the scene got a little too close. Spooked the suspect. Shots were fired. We got him cornered inside the cabin. And the girl? He's got her. It's a hostage situation. Do we have a line of communication open? No, ma'am. Eyes on the cabin? Best as we can. There are only three of us. [gunshots] [screams] Shots fired. Shots fired!
