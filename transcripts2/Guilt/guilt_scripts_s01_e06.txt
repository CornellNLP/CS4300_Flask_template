 Previously on Guilt. 
 The luminol tests show blood. 
 We found trace amounts on the American girl's feet. 
 Gutterie :  Your coppers, they really screwed the pooch on this one. 
 You and I both know that this will not hold up in court. 
 I want it dropped. 
 Gwendolyn :  We've got 22 hours to get Luc Pascal to talk. 
 This is my cousin, Kevin McGee. 
 Nice to meet you, mate. 
 Roz :  Molly's brother broke into Finch's office. 
 He stole the client ledger! Finch is on a war path. He's going to hunt us down and kill us both! Are you lying to me? What are you... (grunts) Grace :  Did they...  ask you anything about that night? I wouldn't say anything if they did. No one will ever know. It's our secret. (tires screech) Mr. Finch. What are you doing here? I've got a little something to show you. (groans, whimpers) Kaley : Oh, my God! Finch : Now, Colin here claims he doesn't know the name of the chap you were shagging in the club. (Colin whimpering) The one who stole my ledger. It's unfortunate. (silenced gunshot, Kaley screams, whimpers) Look at the mess you've made, huh? And all over my favorite jacket. You got anything to say for yourself, hmm? Bit of mea culpa? (whimpers) Find me that ledger. Or you'll be next. ♪ ♪ (indistinct conversations, club music throbbing) (phone ringing) I'll be right back. (sighs heavily) (sighs) When am I getting out of here? We're working on that. But there's a separate matter that I wish to discuss. Molly Ryan's murder. I'm not talking about anything without Stan Gutterie. If he comes in here, he will do anything it takes to make sure that Grace goes free. And if that means you take the fall for Molly's murder, then so be it. You know what? I'll be completely honest... this whole time... I suspected that Grace had killed Molly. But I spent the day going over every shred of evidence. I even called in a blood spatter expert to take a closer look, and do you know what I found? Turns out I had it all wrong. The blood spatter pictures... clearly show that there were two people in the room when Molly died. You... and Grace. You killed Molly Ryan together. (club music throbbing) That was Stan. His source at Scotland Yard said the Crown Prosecutor is interrogating Luc again. About the murder. Why? I thought he got arrested for drugs. My best guess is they're trying to use him to get to you. Can't Stan do something? He's on his way there now. He's gonna try to shut it down. Right, but what if he can't? Grace... You know that prosecutor's had it in for me this whole time. It doesn't matter what the truth is. She'll twist Luc's words, do anything to get me. We won't let her. I'll call Bruno. How'd it go with the press? It's all a blur. I tried to sound smart, but not too intellectual. Mm-hmm. Thoughtful without being snooty, and approachable without sounding flighty. I was terrified I'd give the wrong answer. My "A" levels were a joke in comparison. (both sigh) Welcome to the royal fishbowl. Every second of my life has been documented and scrutinized, from spitting up on my mum during my christening, through every hideously awkward moment of puberty. (Charlotte laughs) It was relentless. I'm just... grateful that you are willing to put up with all the intrusions. Theo, I'll do silly press events every day if it means being with you for the rest of my life. I can't spare you the spotlight. But I can offer one piece of advice that might make it more tolerable. Mm-hmm? Find one thing that's yours. Something that nobody else can take from you. Something that's your secret. Okay. I can do that. What's your secret thing? If I told you that, it wouldn't be mine anymore, would it? (phone ringing) (cell phone rings and buzzes) Hello? Gwen's got Luc back in the box. She's trying to get him to turn on Grace, I know it. Whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down. She set Luc up, didn't she? That whole drug arrest was just a way for her to squeeze him until he buries Grace. I, uh, I... I mean, I have no idea about Gwen's strategy. Can you go down there, try to find out what he's saying? Natalie... I know it's a lot to ask, I'm just... trying to protect my sister. I'm off the case, you know that. You could talk to Pike. He knows what's going on. I've crossed too many lines with you already, Natalie. We shouldn't even be talking about this. I get that. I'm just.. I'm gonna hang up on you now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (over phone): Alex, I... (club music throbbing) They're after me and Luc for Molly's murder. They set Luc up with the drugs, and I'm next. What? What is it? I can't. It's too dangerous. I can't. Roz, I'm going down for this. If... if you know anything... I messed up. I messed up big. After we found Molly... ...I panicked. I nicked her phone. What? Are you crazy? The Courtenay's all over that thing. It will look bad for me and Molly. If the police found out, I... So you were saving your own skin. I would've said something sooner, but... since Molly died, Grace, I've been so scared. Afraid that if I say something... What is going on, Roz? I looked through her phone... and... and there were these threatening texts. What do they say? That he was gonna slit her throat. Who? Who said that? Finch? Yeah. I think the b*st*rd killed Molly. Why didn't you tell the police? He's got the coppers all in his pocket. I know for a fact Lieutenant Commissioner Wesson is a Courtenay regular, as well as half of the judges in the bloody city. Finch will find out. And he'll kill me. Where's the phone now? It's in my bag. I shut it down while we were still at the flat. I couldn't risk the coppers tracing it to me. The police have to see it. Once they see those texts, they'll realize Finch killed Molly. We hand in that phone, it'll never see the light of day. ♪ ♪ We don't hand it in. We plant it on Finch and turn it on. Tonight. The cops will be all over him in a heartbeat. Well, how do we plant it? If one of us starts cozying up to Finch, he'll definitely know something's dodgy. That's why we need someone else. Someone Finch doesn't know. Like who? Like my sister. She's a bloody prosecutor. As if she's gonna plant evidence? She doesn't have to know that's what we're doing. (knocking on door) Kaley : Patrick! (knocking continues) Patrick! Hello? (knocking continues) Patrick... It's Kaley, let me in. Oh, my God. Kaley! (Kaley panting) You have to help me. What happened? A-Are you hurt? He shot him and there was blood, like, everywhere. (Patrick shushing) It's okay, you're all right. You're safe now. Shh, shh. Hey. Who shot who? Finch. He shot that man who brought you into the club. (Patrick sighs, Kaley pants anxiously) He knows you have the ledger, Patrick. You have to give it back. Okay? Or else he's gonna kill us both. Gwendolyn : Come on, Luc. You're an artist. You know every picture tells a story. The more I look at these, the more details I can fill in. See this void. Clearly shows two people were there. The blood hit the person instead of the floor. That's how I know, for certain, that there were two people in that room. Told you this a hundred times already: I didn't kill Molly. But you were there, weren't you? No... You were there, you were in that room, weren't you? You were a witness. You walked in on Grace No... stabbing Molly, your friend. And now you're staying quiet to protect her. Look, if Grace killed Molly, I wouldn't lie to protect her. Really? Because that's what you think love is, don't you? Lying for someone, keeping their secrets. You did it with your mother, now you're doing it with Grace. My mother has nothing to do with this. She left you alone. For almost a week, wasn't it? You were just eight. No food, no electricity, you were a small boy, all alone. And do you know what amazes me about you, Luc? Through everything you went through, the neglect, the abuse, you still fought to stay with her. You lied to the authorities at every turn, to ensure it. That's none of your business. Luc, there's something broken inside of you, do you understand? Because somewhere along the way you began to equate love with deception, (knocking on door) and now this is... (door opens) Gwendolyn : What? You're needed out front, ma'am, right away. There better be a bloody bomb in the building. What do you want, Gutterie? I want to speak with my client. Pronto-like. You represent Mr. Pascal on his drug charges. I'll see you tomorrow, in court, at 8:00, on those. But this is a separate matter. One in which Mr. Pascal has chosen not to engage you. Is anyone representing Luc Pascal? Not even a crappy public defender? Do you know, he hasn't asked for a lawyer. Really? Or has he not asked in exactly the right way and you are denying him counsel on a technicality? Let me break it down for you, Gutterie, there's nothing here for you. So pack up your toys and go home. Buzz the door, please. (lock buzzes) Natalie : Grace, are you kidding me? All this time you've known Molly was a prostitute, and you never thought to tell me? I promised her I wouldn't tell anyone. I didn't want to break my promise after she was dead. I didn't think it would change anything. It's gonna change everything. Out of order. We have to go to the police. Immediately. We can't. A lot of the big guys at Scotland Yard are members of the Courtenay, the Lieutenant Commissioner even. Yeah, this place is major, Nat. The clients are judges, politicians... Roz : And if Finch finds out that I've been giving tips to the coppers, I'm done for. So that's why we need to lead the cops directly to him. But... okay, why here? Why tonight? Because he runs this place, too. Where else do you think he finds all his girls? The man killed my best friend. And he is gonna walk around free while I go to prison for the rest of my life. The phone is in his car. The police have got to be looking for it. All we have to do is turn it on and... Scotland Yard will scoop him right up. If you can just get the keys from him, unlock the car, I can do the rest. Get the keys from him? He usually keeps them in his jacket pocket. This is ridiculous. Please, Nat. If the cops bust him, I'll be free. And we can go home. I wish we could stay here forever. Can't we? (laughs) You have the most beautiful eyes. I hope the baby gets them. We talked about this. We agreed you were gonna get rid of it. It  is our baby. And I never agreed to anything. You just made a royal bloody proclamation and expected me to bow down and fall in line. But I am not your subject and it's not your choice. I'm having this baby whether you like it or not. You listen to me... (Theo grunts) (yells) Molly! (grunts) Molly! You all right, darling? (grunts, gasps) Uh... Uh, yeah. Yeah, sorry. I'm fi... I'm fine. Sorry I woke you, it was a... just a bad dream. (kisses) Go back to sleep. Darling... who's Molly? Theo, who's Molly? Uh, uh... It's embarrassing. I'm going to be your wife, Theo. You can tell me anything. Uh... When I was growing up, I didn't spend much time around other children. I didn't really have many... any... any friends. But there was this dog at the stables at Sandringham called Molly. So I'd... uh... so I used to talk to her. She knew all my secrets. (chuckles) Yeah, she-she wasn't well-bred like the other dogs at the palace, she had this... wildness to her that made her... unpredictable. She sounds lovely. She was. And then, one day... she was gone. What happened to her? I don't know. Not exactly. I went to the stables, but she wasn't there. I called for her, went... looking for her in the woods, where she loved to run. Then I found her. (voice breaking): There was so much blood, uh... (sniffling) W-What happened? What was it? I'm not sure. I think maybe... an animal got her. Oh, you poor thing. That's horrible. I'm so glad you told me. I don't want there to be any secrets between us. Hey. Is that book, um... telling you anything? I think so. The last few months, Molly saw only one client. Gentleman 33. You've seen him a few times, too. Yeah. Any idea who he is? No. I was always blindfolded. I thought it was just his kink, you know? Like how he liked Irish girls, but... well, maybe he doesn't want anyone to know who he is. Yeah, I bet he's the one who got her pregnant. Maybe he didn't want anyone to know that either, so he... you know... took care of it. Don't you think Finch killed her? I mean, after what I saw tonight, I... I don't know. What Finch did today, that was cold, clean. But Molly... whoever killed her, it was personal. Gentleman 33 took my sister personally. And I'm gonna find out who he is. Finch will find you first. He'll find both of us. He's not playing, Patrick. He shot that man like it was nothing. -Look at me. No one's gonna to touch you. I promise. I'll take care of him. I'll take care of you too. I couldn't protect Molly, but I'll do whatever it takes to keep you safe. You barely know me.

 Luc (through intercom) : I'm giving you the truth. Now, Grace didn't kill Molly, and there isn't a single picture that can make me say she did! Gwendolyn (through intercom) : When you feel like talking, you let me know. Bruno : Looks like you're getting nowhere. Geez. You know, I don't recall asking for your opinion. In fact, what are you even doing here? It's the middle of the night and this isn't your case. Oh. (soft chuckle) Did your girlfriend send you? Those blood spatter pictures are fiction and Luc knows it. Must be pretty desperate if you're dummying up evidence like that. It happens to be an effective interrogation technique... one I've seen you employ many times. Yeah, except Luc isn't even near to cracking. Listen, maybe he knows that your two killers theory is BS, because he knows there was one person in that room? Him. Let me have a crack at him, Gwen. Please. Little fresh blood couldn't hurt. ♪ Who will ask ♪ 
♪ The more beautiful question? ♪ (chuckles) You look almost as bored as I feel. Normally I'd be more than happy to entertain you, but I've had a lousy night. Another time. Everyone has bad nights. You just gonna cry in your Chivas about it? (exhales) Most birds don't take that kind of tone with me. They tend to grant me more... respect. I'm not "most birds." ♪ I want you in my bed ♪ 
♪ In a minute flat ♪ 
♪ Let's hit the backseat of your ♪ 
♪ Cherry Cadillac ♪ Come dance with me. Uh... I'm not much of a dancer. Are you sure about that? Very sure. (keys jingle quietly) ♪ You better push that ♪ 
♪ Gear down to the fifth... ♪ (phone chimes) If you want to dance, come upstairs. Upstairs? Yeah. To my office. I want to be alone with you. ♪ Whoa ♪ 
♪ I'll rock you like the sea. ♪ 
♪ ♪ Bruno (over intercom) : Hey, Luc. Thought you might need a little pick-me-up. (groans) It's late. Look, you don't want to be here, I don't want to be here. So I'm certainly not gonna waste your time with any more bogus stories about how blood spatter pictures put two people in the room when Molly was killed. 'Cause we both know that you were the only person in the room when Molly was killed. The only thing I'm trying to figure out is how it went down. Did you go there that night with the intention of killing Molly? Or did you come downstairs, hoping to get lucky, and things just spiraled out of control? Because there is a world of difference between those two things, mate. The first one... well, it's murder. And that'll see you going away to prison for life. But the second one... that's manslaughter. You'd be out in eight to 12. Now, look at me, if it's manslaughter, I can help you, but you've got to tell me what happened. Nothing happened. Really? That's how you're gonna play it? Luc, if I don't help you, mate, the Crown Prosecutor is gonna go after you, do you understand me? She's gonna tell the jury that you came down from the roof with the intention of killing Molly. Why would I want to kill Molly, huh? Why would I want to kill her? It doesn't make any sense. Because Molly was sick and tired of being your little secret lap dance girl, wasn't she, Luc? Because Molly was gonna tell Grace, and you couldn't have that because Grace is your meal ticket, mate. Grace is the one keeping you in cocaine and canvases, isn't she? No, no, no, t-this is all lies. That is not how it is between us, okay? That is not how it is between us. (screaming) You're Grace frickin' Atwood! Would you mind taking a selfie with us? Please? Uh, just one? Yes! Brilliant. Thank you. Oh, it's a bit squinty. Oh, no, no, no. One more? Uh, sure. ♪ Wanna, wanna love me... ♪ (breathing heavily) What? I just... I want to take my time. Get a good look at you. ♪ Wanna, wanna love me ♪

Damn fire alarm. Whoa, whoa, whoa, stay where you are. Don't move. I'll be right back. You better. (door opens) (car alarm chirps) (quietly): Oh, geez! (alarm ringing, whooping) (alarm stops) A camera. Ugh, you sick b*st*rd. (quietly): Oh, my God. (phone chimes) False alarm. Sneaky bitch! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Are you okay? Yeah. We did it. Is everything all right? Theo told me... about Molly. He did? She wasn't a bloody dog, was she? Tell me about when you and Grace left the party. What happened then? We went to the roof, we fooled around for a bit, and then we fell asleep. How long for? I don't know. A while. Come on, one hour, two? Something like that. Then we woke up, and Grace went to the toilet. What woke you up? The street sweeper went by. You never mentioned a street sweeper before. Well, I guess I forgot. You absolutely sure it was a street sweeper? Evan Coker, here to see Paul Day. Evan? Evan! I'm so glad to run into you. Me? Yeah! I've been meaning to call you, see if you wanted to join my team. Move up to the big leagues, start making some grown-up money. Huh? Learn to start speaking "bespoke." Evan (laughs) : I'd... (lock buzzes) I'd be honored. Great. Well, don't let me keep you, I'll walk right with you. Oh, fantastic. All righty. I think I'd be a real asset to your firm. Uh-huh. And I'd bring Danishes every Friday. (both laugh) I can tell you with absolute certainty, that the street sweeper went by the flat at 2:13 a.m. So? So Molly Ryan wasn't killed until very close to 2:45 a.m. Which means that when Grace came downstairs, Molly was still alive. No, Grace just went down to pee, that's all. She, she was only gone a few minutes. Someone must have attacked Molly after Grace came back to the roof. Then how did Grace get Molly's blood all over her feet? Bruno : No. Bruno : How? She was gone longer than a few minutes, wasn't she? No. Yes, she was. How long was she gone for? An hour? Two hours? I don't know. Grace must have passed out on the toilet, and stumbled out after murder. So let me just be clear now, you're admitting to me that she was gone for longer than a couple of minutes. Eh, you're twisting my words. How long was she gone for? Tell me. Tell me. How long, Luc? Come on, tell me, mate. Luc! How long was she gone for, Luc? Close to an hour. Luc : But listen, but listen, I know she didn't kill Molly! (door shuts) (laughs) You did it! That's Grace Atwood in the flat at the time of the murder, with enough time to kill Molly Ryan. You did it! (whoops, laughs) Oh... Is there a problem? No problem. Good. Well! You wanted back on the case, and here you are. Now, go and arrest Grace Atwood. Sure. I want to see Luc Pascal. Now. Go ahead. He's been very helpful, you know. I'm issuing an arrest warrant for Grace Atwood. For the murder of Molly Ryan. Kaley : Mr. Finch? You better have something for me, 'cause I am not in the mood. How'd you get this? I did what I'm good at. And, um, don't worry... there aren't any copies. Who the hell is he? It's Molly Ryan's brother. He's staying on a houseboat. Wharf Road, number 17. Somebody find him! (tapping keys, computer blipping) Finch (on computer) : Take your time. Slow and steady wins the race. Natalie : Oh, Grace. How am I doing? Now do you like me better than Molly? (phone ringing) What is it, Stan? What? Stan called. Is Luc getting out? Yeah, Luc is out, but... But what? The police are coming. To arrest you. They got to Luc, they... No. He wouldn't do that to me. There's no way. Grace... This can't be happening.
