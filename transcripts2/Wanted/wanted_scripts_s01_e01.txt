 Woman 1 :  (Gasps)  Oh, sh1t. Ah! Ow! Who's that? 
 Woman 2 : Ow. It's me. 
 What? Oh. 
 Where are we? 
 We're in a car boot. 
 Yeah, I got that. Oh, God. 
 How long have I been out? 
 Seven minutes. 
 Ow! 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Oh, here. 
 What did you...? 
 What did you do? 
 Oh, no, there's a... 
 Hang on, there's a... there's a light. No, there's a switch. 
 Hang on. 
 Hang on. There. There it is. 
 Ow. 
 What's your name? 
 Chelsea. 
 Chelsea. That's a pretty name. 
 (Sighs) 
 OK.  (Grunts) 
 What are you doing? 
 Please don't do anything. 
 I don't wanna die. 
 Chelsea, if I don't do something, we're already dead, OK? 
 He's stopped. Shh. 
 (Emotionally)  Are we gonna die?

 I've got a Cyclops coming up. 
 (Monster on game growls) 
 Get amongst it. 
 Squeeze in. I'll put that through for you, love. 
 I'll call you back. 
 Ah, excuse me, I'm next. 
 Ah, this won't take a second. 
 Um, neither will these. 
 (Sighs)  So... 
 Thanks. 
 ...just 'cause she's old means she can't wait like the rest of us. 
 Man : It's not rocket surgery, Lola. 
 Just blip, bag, blip, bag, that's it. 
 It's not blip, argue with the customer, bag, it's just... 
 Blip. Hang on, how did that go again, Dale? 
 Blip, bag... 
 OK, I'm not joking. 
 That lady last week made a formal complaint. 
 Yeah, well, she had anger management issues. 
 They always do with you. 
 Uh, by the way, I've had to adjust shifts and you're off Sundays for now. 
 What? 
 Just for now. 
 I'll try to work out something, but... 
 I need those shifts. 
 I can't pay rent without the double. 
 I don't make the rules. 
 This came from up top. 
 There is no 'up top', Dale, you're not working for the World Bank. 
 That Sunday shift's mine. 
 You know, if I was you I would watch it, Lola. 
 You're standing on thin ground. 
 You can't just pull my shifts. 
 (Sighs) 
 Fine. You can shove your job up your arse. 
 Oh, here we go again. Lola... 
 And it is 'ice', Dale - standing on thin ice. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 Chelsea? I need a word. 
 I'll sort this out. 
 Get back to you later. 
 Just got off the phone with the auditors. 
 It seems there have been some anomalies. 
 Pardon? 
 There's money missing from the Henderson portfolio. 
 Oh, that's not my account. That's... 
 You didn't work on it? 
 Um... well, yes, I did, but only as a favour to Brent. 
 No-one is accusing anyone of doing anything. 
 We just want to find out what happened. 
 Mm-hm. 
 The auditors will need access to your files. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Alright, then. 
 Uh, that's, uh... 
 Um, something happened today... 
 I have some great news. 
 Good. 
 Steve got tickets to the Comic-Con. 
 Mm, yay. 
 So we can finally go. 
 We? 
 Yeah, me and Stevie boy. 
 Oh, we don't have anything on the weekend, do we? 
 Mm. 
 Sweet. 
 We're flying down tomorrow. 
 (Ringing tone) 
 Man : Hello? 
 Hey, it's me. 
 Hi, Lola. 
 Change your number again? 
 So, how are ya? 
 Good. Busy. 
 Oh, yeah? Are you looking after yourself? 
 Yeah. 
 How's Susie? 
 She left before Christmas. 
 Sorry. Um... I didn't know. 
 Hey, Lola, I've gotta go. 
 Don't call me Lola. 
 Mum. I have to go, alright? 
 We're sailing out tonight. 
 Tonight? Where are you going this time? 
 Daru. 
 Daru? Where's that? 
 Papua New Guinea. 
 I gotta go, alright? 
 Well, when are you coming back? 
 Why? 
 What you mean why? I'm your mother. 
 Next Friday. 
 I've gotta go, alright? 
 OK, well, take... 
 (Call disconnects) 
 (Train clatters nearby) 
 Hey?! Hey! 
 Oh! 
 Hey, mate... what are you doing? 
 sh1t. 
 Are you alright? 
 (Man groans) 
 Here. Here, let me help you. 
 Oh, God. Oh, sh1t. 
 Hey, Mary Poppins, you wanna give me a hand? 
 Hey. There we go. Oh. 
 Ah! 
 Oh! 
 Hey! Help! 
 Mate, it's OK. We're gonna get you some help, alright? 
 Just... just... sh1t. 
 (Whimpers) 
 (Shrieks)  Ow! Ah! Let go! 
 (Shrieks) 
 (Screams) 
 Oh, God. 
 (Yelps) 
 (Screams) 
 No! 
 (Grunts) 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Whimpers) 
 Don't move. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Shh. 
 (Blows noisily) 
 Don't move. 
 You said that already. 
 Yeah, then, just don't. 
 Christ. Christ. 
 (Groans) 
 What... what are you doing here?! 
 It's our bus stop. 
 It's... 
 In the boot. 
 Get in. 
 Nup. 
 What? 
 Get... in. 
 OK. OK. 
 In! 
 I'm getting in. I'm getting in. 
 Just... 
 (Shrieks) 
 I'm not getting in there. 
 Get in. 
 I have a condition. 
 I have a gun! 
 Get in, Lola. 
 How did you know my name? 
 I'm not getting in. 
 (Whimpers) 
 OK. 
 Alright. 
 Ooh. 
 What are you doing? 
 Please don't do anything. 
 I don't wanna die. 
 Chelsea, if I don't do something we're already dead, OK? 
 He's stopped. 
 Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 Are we gonna die. 
 Here. Here, put your hand on this. 
 Put your hand on this. Here. 
 There, there, there. 
 There? 
 There, there. 
 Got it. 
 Alright. Hang on, there's gotta be a... 
 Let's just leave it. 
 Can't we just wait? 
 Chelsea, he's not taking us for a joy ride, OK? 
 Just... There's got to be a latch or something. 
 Hang on a sec. Have you got a phone? 
 In my bag. 
 Where's your bag? 
 (Sirens wail in distance) 
 Well, maybe he's just gonna drop us off somewhere and get away. 
 Yeah, and make us a cocktail with those little umbrellas. 
 OK. Scoot over. 
 I need to pull the carpet back. 
 What are you doing? Why? 
 Hold your fingers there. 
 Because underneath there's... there's a spare tyre and jack thing. 
 What are you gonna do with that? 
 Well, when he stops the car, you distract him and I'm gonna hit him with it. 
 Distract... 
 How am I gonna distract him? 
 Well, I dunno, with your charm, your looks. 
 Just keep him busy and I'll... 
 I'm not like that! 
 Fine, then just... 
 ...use your eyes. 
 Just keep him busy and I'll whack him. 
 Well, no, that's... that's a terrible idea. He has a gun. 
 Which is why we need the jack thing, OK? 
 Just get over. Move. I need to... 
 Ow! My eye! 
 Well, I'm sorry. 
 You hit me in the eye! 
 No. Hang on, wait. 
 Turn that... 
 I'm trying to pull it. 
 There. Pull the thing there. 
 Pull it there. 
 Yes, I've got it. OK. 
 Just... 
 Turn it off. He's stopped again. 
 Woman : What ARE you gonna be? 
 Girl : He's not giving it back. 
 Boy : Hey, it was my go. 
 (Phone vibrates) 
 Good morning, good morning. 
 That's enough. We're about to go. 
 Is that mine, sweetie? 
 Thank you so much. 
 Ray, don't. 
 (Phone continues vibrating) 
 Dad! 
 In we go. In we go. 
 Yes? 
 Ray? 
 What do you think? 
 Uh, is Ray there? 
 Ray! 
 Someone on your other phone. 
 Huh? 
 Your OTHER other phone. 
 Oh. 
 You know, most people find one phone's enough. 
 Hello? 
 The whole thing went to sh1t. 
 Can you just hold on, please? 
 One more. 
 That's right, go off and make your secret man date. 
 Mum! 
 It's Chris, right? 
 You said no-one would be killed. 
 Alright, just take a deep breath. 
 Where's Jones? 
 Jones is dead. Jones is a mad man. 
 He just came out shooting. 
 He even tried to kill a couple of women. 
 Dad! Dad! Dad, look! 
 You said it would be a simple handover. Car for the money. 
 Can you just hold on a second, please, Chris? 
 Sure! 
 Yes, mate? 
 80,000, Dad. 
 On the third level. 
 Mate, that's fantastic. 
 Off you go, pack your bag. Don't forget your footy boots, alright? 
 OK. 
 Sorry, Chris, bit of a crazy morning. 
 (Laughs) 
 Have you got the car? 
 Yeah. 
 OK, nothing's changed. 
 You drive to the Backman yards. 
 You drive straight there and you wait to hear from me. 
 OK. 
 You mentioned something about two women. 
 Yeah, they just... they came out of nowhere. 
 One of them shot Jones. 
 Where did they get to? 
 Chris? 
 In the boot. 
 Shh. 
 I didn't say anything. 
 Well, shh anyway. 
 He's talking to someone. 
 They saw my face. 
 Look, these things happen. 
 Alright, mate, I've gotta go. 
 You take the car to the yards, OK? 
 You take care of yourself and I'll, uh... 
 Look, just make sure you take care of those two women as well, alright? 
 Chris! 
 OK. 
 Get out. 
 We're fine in here, thanks. 
 It's surprisingly comfortable. 
 Just get out already. 
 (Groans) 
 I need to go to the toilet. 
 No. 
 Please. Please, I really... 
 Absolutely not. 
 What, you're just gonna make her go there, are you? 
 Alright. 
 Alright. 
 Where. 
 You go over there, stay where I can see you. 
 One of you stays here. 
 Oi! You try anything funny... 
 (Cocks gun)  ..your friend here dies. 
 She's not my friend. 
 We just catch the same bus. 
 Whatever. 
 You got one minute. 
 Who goes in one minute? 
 We've been locked in there for ages. 
 You're not... understanding how this works. 
 Oi! Where I can see you! 
 But I can't... 
 Squat. 
 OK. 
 Squat standing up. 
 But... 
 Mate, why don't you just let us go? 
 We're not gonna say anything. 
 If the cops ask, we'll just say it was the other guy. 
 He was the one with the gun. 
 I mean, why do you want to make this worse than it already is? 
 Just... 
 What are you? 22? 23? 
 I've got a son almost your age. 
 Um, couldn't actually go because I can't go when somebody's watching or listening, but, um... thank you for... 
 I wasn't listening to anything. Go! 
 Oi! What they hell are you doing? 
 Get over here. 
 Near the pylon! Here! Here! 
 What... 
 Wait, you're not gonna... 
 Please! You don't have to do this. 
 Turn around. 
 Why would he let me go to the toilet if I... 
 He's not gonna shoot two women in the back. 
 Oh, my... 
 He's not that kind of person. 
 Are you? 
 (Chelsea sobs) 
 Get in the boot! 
 Alright. 
 Get in the boot now! 
 Please don't make us go back in there. 
 Just... just get in! 
 If you put us back in there I swear I'm gonna scream the whole way down! 
 Just... just put us in the... Just put us in the back. 
 Just put us in... 
 No! 
 Yes! Yes! 
 You're gonna drive. 
 So I'm gonna have my gun on you. 
 You're gonna sit in the back seat. 
 But let me make this perfectly clear. 
 I don't drive. 
 sh1t. 
 You're gonna drive. 
 And your gonna sit in the back seat. 
 Um, is it a manual? 
 If you'd JUST get in! 
 (Indistinct police radio chatter) 
 Just careful. If we can bring him through slowly. 
 (Siren wails) 
 Woman : A GSW to the chest. 
 Victim's name is Victor Maric. 
 Alright. Yeah, thanks. 
 Hey. See this? 
 Jeez. 
 
 
 
 What kept you? 
 Sir. 
 Boss. 
 What's the first thing we always do, boys? 
 Secure the CCTV. 
 There is always a camera somewhere. 
 Did they leave anything? 
 No, they wiped the lot. 
 Get Crime Scene in here for prints. 
 You're the new guy. 
 Sorry. Josh. Josh Levine. 
 Levine. That's right, I've heard about you. 
 Yeah. 
 So, what do you think of the sh1t storm out there? 
 Yeah. Uh, dead cop lying next to a drug baron's nephew, it's... 
 Don't jump to conclusions. 
 This is sensitive stuff. 
 Seal in here as well. 
 Only must-knows in. 
 Use the Terrorism Act if you have to. 
 Now? 
 Mm. 
 Yeah. 
 Welcome to homicide. 
 (Stops engine) 
 It's a nice car. 
 You can go a bit faster. 
 Pardon? 
 You're driving very slowly. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I'm more a convertible kind of girl myself. 
 (Horn blares, tyres screech) 
 Hey, easy. 
 Sorry. 
 Just let us go. 
 I wouldn't tell the cops, she wouldn't. 
 You didn't even shoot anyone. 
 Exactly. 
 It was Lola. 
 What's important is you haven't done anything wrong. 
 Not yet. 
 Except for kidnapping us. 
 Shut up, please. 
 OK. 
 If you just... let us go right now, all of this just disappears. 
 We'll just walk away. The cops don't need to know anything. 
 The guy you just shot, he WAS a cop. 
 A corrupt and dangerous cop. 
 So you guys are in this, whether you like it or not. 
 Turn it off. 
 (Stops engine) 
 So, what now? 
 Hey! What now? 
 We wait. 
 What are you doing? 
 Shh. 
 Are you alright? 
 Yeah. 
 What's the matter? 
 (Grunts) 
 Uh... I need to go to the bathroom. 
 Again? 
 I couldn't go before. 
 See, Mr One-Minute Man? 
 Absolutely not. 
 Please. I promise I won't do anything. 
 Come on, just let the girl wee. 
 Alright. 
 Thank you. 
 Over there. 
 Where? 
 There. Hey, what are you doing? 
 Nothing. I'm just having a stretch. 
 Well, stretch IN the car! 
 Hey! 
 I know, just... just here. 
 Just here. 
 Alright, where I can see you. 
 Really go this time. 
 Make it count! 
 Police, please. 
 Yeah? 
 Man :  (On phone)  What happened, Ray? 
 Jones doublecrossed us. 
 He killed Victor Maric. 
 Simple transaction. 
 The money for the car. 
 I didn't' plan for this, alright? 
 Where's the car now? 
 I've got it. I've got it all. 
 Small miracles. 
 You know, there's only one way out of this, Ray - that's if you deliver that car today. 
 It's being taken care of. 
 Well, I hope so. 
 You fix it, Ray. 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 Can you hang on? 
 We have an unconfirmed 104 in a car yard, somewhere near Bachman. 
 Two females held at gunpoint. 
 Phone trace was incomplete. 
 Exact location unknown. 
 I've gotta go. 
 Yeah? 
 Are you by any chance at the drop-off point? 
 What? Yeah. 
 Well, I just heard an emergency call from a woman there who claims to have been kidnapped at gunpoint. 
 No, she just went to the toil... 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Yeah, well, you find her and kill her before they get there or I will kill you. 
 Noooo! 
 Hey! Hey! 
 No! No, don't. 
 No. No. 
 In the boot! In the boot NOW! 
 Alright, OK, OK! Alright, alright! 
 Get in! 
 sh1t. 
 sh1t! 
 Ahhh! 
 (Metal clangs) 
 (Groans) 
 Chelsea?! 
 Chelsea! 
 Stop! Stop! 
 Oh! 
 Are you OK? 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you! 
 Chelsea?! 
 Oh! 
 OK, where's the kidnapper? 
 He's probably gone back to the car. 
 Are you OK, miss? 
 You're not safe here. 
 I need you both in the car now. 
 I want you both to just sit tight for a moment. 
 I need to ensure he doesn't flee the scene. 
 He's got a gun. 
 OK. 
 Stay here. 
 (Door lock chimes) 
 Why is he... Hang on, he's locked the doors. 
 Why has he locked the doors? 
 Yeah, to protect us. 
 So that the... 
 Oh, God! Oh, sh1t! 
 Oh, God. We've got to get out of here. Get out of here! 
 (Door lock chimes) 
 We've got to get out of here. 
 OK, out. 
 What? 
 Out now. Out now! Move! 
 No! No! 
 Move out! Come on! 
 Get out of the car. 
 We didn't do anything! 
 We didn't do anything. 
 Move down here, move down here. 
 Move, move, move, move, move. 
 Please. We didn't do anything. 
 Get over here. 
 Get over there. 
 Behind that silver car. Move. Move! 
 Get over there! 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Women scream) 
 (Groans) 
 (Groans) 
 What did I do? 
 I didn't know it was you, mate. 
 Bullshit! 
 Where's Ray? 
 Did Ray tell you to? 
 Did Ray tell you to shoot me?! 
 (Gunshot) 
 Chelsea! Chelsea. 
 What the hell is happening? 
 We've got to get out here. 
 Well, shouldn't we wait for the police? 
 The police are already here. 
 But they can't all be bad? 
 What, do you want to wait and find out? 
 (Sirens wail in distance) 
 How much? 
 We have to get out of here. 
 No. Please, stay. 
 Chelsea, I don't know what's going on, I don't know who's coming but we have to leave now. 
 See you, Chelsea. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 I thought you couldn't drive. 
 Well, you sustained a head injury today so I should probably drive. 
 No offence, but you're a shitful driver. 
 (Starts engine) 
 Why don't we just go to a police station? 
 We just... we just need to get somewhere and stop and think, OK? 
 Well, is there somebody else we could call, like your husband? 
 Nah. 
 What about you? 
 Have you got a boyfriend? 
 Big, scary type with a gun? 
 No, not really. 
 Family? 
 My father lives in Shanghai and my mother's dead. 
 Sorry. 
 Oh, God! 
 Oh, God, no. 
 What? 
 I'm being audited today. 
 They'll think I didn't come to work because I'm guilty. 
 Well, Chelsea, we just need to get somewhere safe, OK? 
 Do you know of anywhere? 
 Um... 
 Well, my father still has a holiday house up in the mountains and nobody ever goes there. 
 Well, how far is it? 
 Um... 
 Well, at this hour, as long as there's no traffic in Highbury and we get a clear run up the A30, we should be there in an hour and... 
 ...23 minutes. 
 Yeah. 
 Righto. 
 G'day, buddy. 
 How are you? 
 Bit of trouble down at the bus stop earlier. 
 You know anything about that? 
 That's a nice umbrella. 
 Where'd you get it? 
 Er... er... someone gave it to me. 
 What's your name? 
 Kenny. 
 Kenny. 
 Well, don't lie to me, Kenny. 
 You picked this up at the bus stop. 
 Where's the handbag? 
 Lola : We had no choice back there, OK? 
 People are dead and they're going to think that we're responsible. 
 Well, we're not. 
 They'll work that out soon enough. 
 Hey, Chelsea, just... 
 I know it's tough. You're just going to have to calm down, alright? 
 (Laughs)  Calm down? 
 Well, I'm sorry I'm not as free-spirited as you. 
 Just how am I free-spirited? 
 Well, for starters, you're often late for the bus - at least twice a week. 
 What? 
 Wow, I didn't realise I was being monitored. 
 Oh, I'm just observant. 
 We have caught the same bus for 18 months. 
 I'm sure... you must have noticed things about me. 
 Oh, sure. Yeah. 
 What? 
 You have anxiety issues. 
 That's not true. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 You always look like a deer in headlights, like you're waiting for something terrible to happen. 
 Well, it did. 
 OK, that emergency call from the woman, we couldn't trace it or track it. 
 We couldn't identify the number. 
 You there? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 And there's a body here. 
 James Ryder. He's an ex-cop. 
 You remember he had those corruption charges against him a few years back? 
 His car's dressed up with dash lights. 
 It looks like he's fired off a shot. 
 Anybody else there? 
 Hey? Anyone... No. 
 Um, but I've got to tell you, a cop and Victor Maric found dead together and now this? 
 I'll run those plates and get them to send me an audio file of the emergency call. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Sir? 
 I said I'll take care of it! 
 OK. Well, should I... 
 (Call disconnects) 
 Lola : It's beautiful up here. 
 Hm? 
 Yeah. 
 So, what did you mean when you said you have a boyfriend, not really? 
 Was that, like, a Tinder thing? 
 Oh! 
 Tinder? 
 As if.  (Sighs) 
 Well, do you want to call your 'not boyfriend'? 
 No. 
 (Phone vibrates) 
 Righto. 
 Don't answer. Don't answer it. 
 I'm not. I didn't. 
 No, don't chuck it out! 
 Just... turn it off. 
 We might need it. 
 For emergencies only, OK? 
 (Computer chimes) 
 Gotcha.  (Starts engine) 
 Lola : Wow. 
 That's a holiday house? 
 No, that's the guesthouse. 
 What? 
 (Burps)  Ooh, sorry. 
 Did you want one? 
 You've got... 
 ...blood. 
 Maybe you should have a shower. 
 There's one down the hall. 
 I'll just... I'll get you one of my father's shirts. 
 Here. Um, it's just off to the right, off the main bedroom. 
 Hey, Chelsea, it's going to be OK. 
 If we just stay here tonight... 
 ...we can call someone tomorrow and get some help, yeah?

 (Gasps) 
 G'day, Lola. Where's the money? 
 It's in the car. 
 Wrong. 
 I've already checked, so let's try it again. Where is the money. 
 I told you, it's in the back seat of the car, in a bag. 
 Where's your friend? 
 She's gone. 
 Let's go and have a chat with her, shall we? 
 OK. 
 Who are you working for? 
 Anton Maric? 
 Dale at Lane Mart. 
 Call your friend, get her now. 
 No. 
 (Bang!) 
 Back, back, back. Move, move, move! 
 I can't... 
 Not much of a friend, is she? 
 Anton Maric isn't gonna like this. 
 Who are you? 
 I can take you to the money. 
 It's back this way. 
 (Aerosol hisses) 
 Aarggh! Aarggh! 
 (Shrieks) 
 Where's the money? 
 Oh, I hid it. 
 You should never leave money in a car. 
 No, wait, wait. We should leave it - that's what he wants. 
 No, Chelsea, we're not leaving it. 
 How did he find us? 
 The phone. Where's the phone? 
 Oh.
