 Oh! 
 Hold it right there. 
 I don't even know who you are. 
 Cold-blooded murderess. 
 Bad wife. 
 Oh, she'll tell you tales about Jackson, I'm sure. 
 That he had a short fuse. 
 She stabbed my son in the throat over his chicken dinner. 
 So... this is for my son. 
 But what about your grandson? 
 Grandson? No! 
 Run, Chelsea. Run! 
 I'm on the run from the cops, Dad. 
 If the clean cops catch me, they're gonna put me away. 
 If the dirty cops catch me, they're probably gonna kill me. 
 We believe she's acting alone, but still connected to the Maric crew. 
 You're my guy on the ground, OK? 
 Whatever you find out, you come to me first, yeah? 
 Yep. 
 Stop! (FIRES GUN) 
 Run a distinctive marking check. 
 We're looking for a crim with a triple eight tat. 
 Passports? Why do we need passports? 
 It'll help solve a lot of problems, alright? 
 That'll be 10 grand deposit. 
 And another 50K at the other end in Mossman. 
 Where's the car? 
 Alright, my son Liam's got it. 
 He left about two hours ago. 
 He went off to Baruma. 
 The big Bush Bash. 
 Where are we going now? 
 To get our car back.

 (GASPS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Do you want me to drive? 
 You need to sleep. 
 No, I'm fine. 
 I'll sleep when we get the car back. 
 We should talk about what happened yesterday. 
 There's a lot of bad memories for you. 
 It's a lot of scary new ones for me. 
 So... you don't wanna talk about it? 
 Look, we just need to find the car, buy the passports and fly to Daru, OK? 
 Daru? What's in Daru? 
 David. 
 I was right, wasn't I? 
 He is Jackson's son. 
 Do you think he's in danger, because I told Beverley about him? 
 Well, you know, maybe if you told me the truth about everything then I would have known not to mention him. 
 Somehow, I don't think that would have mattered. 
 What do you mean? 
 You have a tendency to talk before you think. 
 Well, OK. At least I talk. 
 You keep everything to yourself. 
 Like what? 
 Like your real name, Lillian. 
 Like what happened to you in Wooradulla. 
 Yeah, well, that's in the past. 
 You keep asking me to trust you, but you won't trust me. 
 Yeah, with good reason! 
 One minute you're freaking out over passports and the next, you're nicking lipsticks! 
 Still haven't got to the bottom of that yet either, have we? 
 Look, that's not fair. 
 Yeah, well, life's just sh1t sometimes. 
 OK, fine. 
 I steal lipsticks... because it makes me feel better about myself. 
 Because it makes me feel like I have control over something in my life. 
 That's my problem. 
 And I'm sorry. 
 I hope David's OK. 
 David's a thousand miles away in another country. 
 He's safe. 
 Want anything? 
 Woman : (ON RADIO) ..heading north in a stolen vehicle with additional resources being brought into play as the search widens. 
 Task force detectives believe Lola Buckley... 
 Yes, hi. 
 I'm trying to get through to the Ocean Queen Fishing Company. 
 Their office is in Daru. 
 Yeah. PNG. Thanks. 
 Overnight, the father of one of the fugitives made an emotional plea to his daughter to give herself up. 
 Man : Please, Chelsea, I'm asking you to turn yourself in. 
 I know this isn't your doing. 
 Just make contact. 
 Police describe Chelsea Babbage as a 5ft 8, 29-year-old Caucasian woman... 
 Hi. I'm trying to find David Buckley. 
 He's an employee on one of your boats. 
 Yeah, he should have arrived in Daru about two days ago. 
 Sorry? 
 Yeah, no, I need to contact him. 
 It's an emergency. 
 He what? 
 We're on the radio. 
 There's a whole bulletin about us. 
 One of the fugitives is accused of embezzling Âo1.37 million from the accounting company she worked for. 
 One... What?! 
 You embezzled over a million dollars? Whoa. 
 No! No, no, no. 
 That's... That's a mistake! 
 A mistake? 
 It was $33,476... and 24 cents. 
 35 grand? 
 Well, it was more of a rounding error. 
 I didn't actually spend any of it. 
 You're on the run for 35 grand. 
 And the line of people wanting to shoot me. 
 What? 
 Nothing, Chelsea. Nothing. 
 Detective Joshua Levine. 
 How are you feeling, Mr Patterson? 
 Oh, why don't I pop one of my nuts into your mouth and you can tell me? 
 Where's the car? 
 No idea what you're talking about. 
 Did these women do this to you? 
 Did you steal their car, Mr Patterson? 
 It was abandoned. 
 I was just looking after it. 
 Then why did they smash you up like this? 
 Mr Patterson... 
 No, that wasn't them. 
 That was some other psycho. 
 Did he have a tattoo like this one, inside right wrist? 
 So what, the women took the car... 
 No, I didn't have it. 
 My son, Liam, he borrowed it. 
 He's got a thing for the big Yank cars. 
 Mr Patterson, when this psycho was busting your balls, did you tell him where your son was going? 
 They're heading to a place called Baruma. 
 There's a Bush Bash there this week. 
 They're after a car, it's a black Chrysler. 
 What would they want with a car? 
 I don't know. 
 But the Marics are drug dealers. 
 What if they're working for them? 
 What, as couriers? 
 It would explain their move north. 
 'Cause remember that map we found in Lola Buckley's flat? 
 It was a south-east Asian drug route, plugged right into the Top End. 
 Anyway, I'm jumping on a flight to Baruma now. 
 Boss, you there? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 But the car, you'll tell no-one, right, where you're going, no-one. 
 Right. Because I was gonna put out a KALOF on the Chrysler. 
 If they're heading to a drug drop, we might catch more than a couple of couriers. 
 What, you think I should just tail them? 
 We might even catch who organised the killings. 
 You find them, you call me with the location, alright? 
 Yep. Got it. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Stanton. 
 Anton wants to chat. 
 Look, I'm at work... 
 Now. 
 I'm...! 
 (DISCONNECTS) 
 (ROARS) 
 (STARTS CAR) 
 Oh, look out boys. The coppers! 
 Wanna frisk me? 
 (MEN LAUGH) 
 I thought you would wanna update me. 
 Well this thing, you know, I'm busting my arse trying to control it. 
 My property was meant to be delivered a week ago. 
 They've been sighted in Queensland. 
 I'm flying up there this morning to take control of it myself. 
 My sister is so angry. 
 Her son's been killed. 
 And she blames me for it. 
 Now, she wants me to bring her your heart. 
 But I reckon she'd settle for your eye. 
 We've been doing business a long time, Ray. 
 Familiarity breeds contempt. 
 I've got nothing but respect for you, Anton. 
 So you're goin' up north to sort this, then? 
 Yep. 
 Gleb and Yuri are going with you. 
 No. 
 No. They can't be seen with me, half the force are looking for them. 
 They're big boys, Ray. 
 They just want to help you. 
 And the moment you get my car, they get it. 
 Do you understand?

 What if he's already found the money? 
 Well, then he won't be here. 
 I need to get to Cairns. 
 Why? 
 I called David from that shop. 
 He must've heard the news. 
 He jumped on a boat. 
 He's due back in two days. 
 OK, so we're going to Cairns now. 
 No, I'm going to Cairns. 
 You don't have to. 
 I think you should turn yourself in. 
 Are you serious? 
 Chelsea, you embezzled 35 grand. 
 It's a first offence. 
 You'll get a... 
 You'll get a slap on the wrist. 
 Just think about it, OK? 
 I'm gonna go and check the registration tent, see if the car's been checked in. 
 Meet me back here in 10 minutes, alright? 
 10 minutes? 
 Man : Come over here, grab a T-shirt. 
 Get a Hawaiian shirt. 
 Hey, darlin'! 
 Wanna buy a T-shirt? 
 No, thanks, darling. 
 Come on! I've got your size. 
 Sexy lady? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Red one? White one? 
 What about a white one? 
 Hey, darlin'! Wanna buy a T-shirt? 
 Ain't got none. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Hello. 
 Yeah. 
 G'day! 
 Wait, wait, wait... 
 Where are you going? 
 Um, can I just say that it's very rare that I meet someone so beauti... 
 Wait, wait! Don't be shy. 
 I mean, you are really beautiful. 
 Maybe we can just have a little sneaky kiss under the mistletoe? 
 It's not mistletoe. 
 Whoa! Hey... 
 Wanna buy a T-shirt? 
 Got your size, handsome. 
 What was it again? 
 Ah, Liam Patterson. 
 He's my, um, husband. 
 Hubby checked in half an hour ago. 
 Great. So where would he be? 
 You keep him on a tight leash, hey? 
 He probably went to head off again. 
 There's a bit of a traffic jam. 
 Head off? I thought... 
 I thought this was the finish line. 
 Checkpoint. 
 The Bash ends at Myong, 200 kays north. 
 sh1t. Thanks. 
 (REVS ENGINE) 
 Hey! Hey, hey, hey! 
 sh1t! 
 sh1t. 
 Hey. Hey. Excuse me. 
 Did you see my friend? 
 Tall, skinny, dark hair? 
 The pretty one? 
 Yeah. 
 No. You wanna buy a T-shirt? 
 Listen, if you see her, just tell her I've got to go but I'll be back, alright? 
 What? 
 Can you tell her that for me, please. 
 Yeah. 
 Woman : Babbage and Forrester, this is Veronique. 
 Veronique, it's Chelsea Babbage. 
 I'd like to talk to my father, please. 
 You can't. He's on a plane. 
 Oh, when's he arriving in Sydney? 
 He's not flying to Sydney, Chelsea. 
 He's going to London. 
 What? What's he doing in London? 
 He went to a business conference. 
 But I heard him on the radio. 
 He gave that interview at the airport in Shanghai. 
 I can try and get a hold of him, but he's on a plane so I don't like your chances. 
 No. Forget it. 
 (NOVELTY CAR HORN SOUNDS) 
 There's... 
 Wha... 
 Excuse me! Excuse me. 
 The 4-wheel-drive that was just here, did you see it leave? 
 Wanna buy a T-shirt, sexy lady? 
 No. No, I don't. 
 No, love, didn't see it. 
 But... 
 She left me. 
 Stanton : (ON PHONE) You've called Ray Stanton. Leave a message. 
 (TONE SOUNDS) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 I've got a ping on that vehicle. 
 Local farmer found it burned out in his paddock about 400 clicks north of Wooradulla. 
 No sign of your tattooed crook though. 
 Right. 
 OK, look, I'm looking for the boss. 
 Is he there? 
 He's jumped on the heli. 
 On his way to Baruma as we speak. 
 Right. I've got to go. 
 Oh! Sorry. 
 It's OK. 
 Um, can I get a vodka... neat... double, please. 
 There you are! 
 Oh. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Are you following me? 
 I think she's following me, boys! 
 I told you that she... 
 No. 
 Mate, maybe you should maybe take off. 
 Piss off! 
 I'm not your mate. 
 Who's this? Your boyfriend? 
 Huh? 
 It's alright. Relax. 
 You relax, I'm talking to... 
 Mate, look, I told you to relax, didn't I? 
 Hey? Just take five. Take five. 
 Sorry about that. You alright? 
 Yes, I'm fine. 
 You here on your own? 
 Um, no. Well, yeah... Yes. 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know? 
 I was with someone but they left. 
 They left? Where did they leave to? 
 Look, I just want to be by myself. 
 It's not really an ideal place to do that, is it? 
 This isn't a good time. 
 Chelsea Babbage, you are under arrest on suspicion of murder. 
 You are not obliged to say or do anything. 
 Anything you say or do may be used in evidence. 
 Do you understand your rights? 
 
 
 
 (FLY BUZZES) 
 Stanton : You've called Ray Stanton. Leave a message. 
 (TONE SOUNDS) 
 Yeah, boss. It's me. 
 Listen, there's been a slight change of plan so if you could call me as soon as you land... 
 Thanks. 
 Woman : (ON GPS) Continue straight for 150km. 
 My name's Detective Joshua Levine, and I'm part of the task force that's been set up to track you down. 
 Race official said the car you're so hot for is heading to Myong. 
 I'm guessing your new best mate's going there too. 
 Hey? Am I right? 
 So what happened at the bus stop in Sydney? 
 Hey? Who shot Keith Jones? 
 Victor Maric? 
 Chelsea, you are actually gonna have to talk to me. 
 No, I'm not. 
 I know my rights. 
 My father's a lawyer. 
 (HORN SOUNDS) 
 You're blocking the road. 
 Yeah, sorry! Stalled on me. 
 Don't suppose you know anything about engines, do you? 
 Whole family's in the car business. 
 Well! Must be my lucky day. 
 Yeah, well I was on target to beat my best time and you just stuffed it for me. 
 Yeah, gee, sorry about that. 
 No wonder your car's stuffed! 
 Someone's pulled a wire.

 Woman : Continue straight for 130km. 
 Why did you do it? 
 Do what? 
 Going on the run, it's just... so stupid. 
 Well, you don't know anything. 
 I know you embezzled from your employer. 
 I know your boyfriend loves comic books and I know that you've got a whole drawer in your apartment full of unopened lipsticks. 
 You went into my apartment? 
 That's my job, Chelsea. 
 Did you talk to Nathan? 
 I did. 
 And to be honest, he sounded a lot more concerned about his water cooled computer than you. 
 I'm sure he was very worried about you too. 
 Like I said, you don't know anything. 
 I know your mum died when you were young. 
 And you still sleep with her cardigan under your pillow. 
 Why would you say that? 
 Because... I know this isn't you, Chelsea. 
 You've been led along by Lola Buckley and now you're in way over your head and you... you're not cut out for this. 
 Hey? Am I right? 
 I'm not saying anything else until I speak to a lawyer. 
 Hey, mate. Did you see my friend? 
 Traded up. 
 Did you see her? 
 Sure did. Want to buy a T-shirt? 
 Do I have a choice? 
 Here. 
 What, just one? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Well? 
 Oh, she took off. 
 She took off? When? 
 About an hour ago. 
 Did you give her my message? 
 I didn't get a chance to. 
 She took off in a car with some young fellow. 
 What young fellow? 
 I don't know. 
 Handsome chap, big neck. 
 Wouldn't buy a bloody T-shirt, though. 
 Mind you, with the size of his neck, it probably wouldn't have fit. 
 Did they say where they were going? 
 By the look on their faces, maybe a motel. 
 (SLURPS) 
 This Bush Bash ends in Myong, you two should head there. 
 Trying to get rid of us, Ray? 
 Give me a minute. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Job isn't finished. 
 The place is crawling with cops, and they're looking for you. 
 You mean my car. 
 No, this. 
 You've done a great job getting us to here, but it's only a matter of time before the cops put an ID to that. 
 You go home. 
 I'll take it from here. 
 I'm sorry. I'll be in touch. 
 (CHELSEA SIGHS) 
 Can I open the window? (WHEEZES) 
 No. 
 (WHEEZES) 
 Do you have Ventolin? 
 No. 
 I get asthma... when I get too hot. 
 No, you don't, Chelsea. 
 (WHEEZES) 
 If you don't have... have Ventolin, I need some water. 
 I can't... I can't breathe. 
 I can't breathe. 
 (WHEEZES) I can't breathe. Please. 
 Alright, listen. I'll stop. 
 You just keep calm, Chelsea, alright? Keep calm. 
 (WHEEZES) 
 Chelsea... don't do anything stupid. 
 (WHEEZES) 
 (STOPS WHEEZING) 
 Come on, you big unit, your shout. 
 (CRIES) Help! 
 Hey! Gorgeous, long time no see. 
 You following me? 
 That guy at the Bush Bash... he... he offered me a lift and he kidnapped me. 
 He threatened me with a knife. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Please, you have to help me, please. 
 He's got the keys, he's in there. 
 Please help me, please. Hurry! 
 Boys, inside! 
 Think you can come low grass? 
 Get his keys! 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (UNLOCKS CAR) 
 Thank God. 
 Thank God, thank you so much. 
 Get out of here, go! 
 (GRUNTS) 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
 You kidnapped that girl. 
 I arrested her! I'm a cop! 
 I'm a cop. 
 (ENGINE STARTS) 
 Chelsea! Chelsea! 
 Oh, my God! (LAUGHS) 
 Yes! Yes! 
 In way over my head, hey? 
 Well, take that, Mr Detective, and stick it where the sun don't shine. 
 Woman : Recalculating. 
 Turn back when possible. 
 What? Turn... Turn back? 
 No. 
 Turn back when possible. 
 No! No turning back. 
 Turn back when possible. 
 No turning back.

 (DOOR OPENS) 
 I figured you'd turn up here for the passports after you ditched me. 
 What? I didn't ditch you. 
 Oh, sure. 
 No, no, no. The car was leaving, I tried to find you, and when I came back for you you'd already left. 
 No, I don't believe you. 
 I wouldn't lie to you, Chelsea. 
 Oh, why not? 
 You lie to everybody else. 
 Because you're my only friend. 
 I thought you decided that I-I was better off giving up. 
 Look, I should have told you the truth about Wooradulla. 
 I had no right to drag you into that. 
 I do trust you. 
 I know that I don't have to be here. 
 I could just... turn myself in and get my father to try and fix it. 
 But I'm choosing not to. 
 I want to be here with you. 
 (LAUGHS) Because you're my only friend, too. 
 Woman : Here you are. 
 Hey. Chelsea. 
 Chelsea. 
 What? What? Oh! 
 Arrested? 
 Yep. But I got away. 
 Well, with the help of this kind of sleazy bush basher guy, but still, I... 
 Oh, my God, it felt so good. 
 Do you know what's really bizarre? 
 I feel totally free for the first time in my life. 
 Good. Oh, sh1t! 
 Put your hands on that car. 
 Both of you. Do it. 
 You were saying? Is this the guy? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Empty your hands. Empty your hands. 
 You're under arrest. 
 Again. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Yeah, Levine, I've been calling you. 
 Sorry, boss. I've been a bit busy. 
 Yeah? What the hell's happening? 
 I've got 'em. 
 What, both of them? 
 Yep. 
 Zip tied, read them their rights, they're not going anywhere. 
 What about the car? 
 They're sitting on the back seat of it right now. 
 Where are you? 
 Mossman. 
 Alright. Well... 
 We'll meet at a halfway point, yeah? 
 Bring them in together. 
 I'll text you some coordinates for a safe location, alright? 
 Gotcha. Thanks. 
 Um, how did... How did you find us? 
 GPS. Hire car. 
 (PHONE MESSAGE BEEPS) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 I hear you've left town. 
 Levine's found the women and the car. 
 Levine's not one of us. 
 I'm sending them to a location where Maric's men will be waiting. 
 They'll kill him and the women, then I'll turn up and make sure everyone gets their property back. 
 I hear Anton's on his way. 
 I told that little sh1t I was going to sort this. 
 No more mistakes, Ray. 
 They're professionals, alright? 
 Where's Boke? 
 Boke made a mistake. 
 I had to cut him loose. 
 Well, I hope it wasn't premature. 
 Your judgment has left a lot to be desired. 
 It's only your connections that have kept you alive this far. 
 Can you just trust me a little bit longer? 
 It'll be over soon. 
 (DISCONNECTS) 
 Please, God, let it be over. 
 Woman : (ON GPS) 
 Continue for two kilometres. 
 You're making a mistake. 
 I'm not sure I'm interested in hearing your advice, Lola. 
 Or is it Lillian? 
 I'm so sorry. I had no idea the car could be traced. 
 I would've nicked it, too. 
 We are innocent. 
 Well, why did you run? 
 We were kidnapped. 
 Yes, and police were trying to kill us. 
 What police? 
 The one at the car yard. 
 Right, the one that you shot? 
 You really think she's capable of killing anyone? 
 I think one of you is. 
 You've got no idea what she's been through. 
 I'm just doing my job. 
 You'll be taken into custody, no-one is going to hurt you. 
 At the intersection, continue straight for one kilometre. 
 This is where you're taking us? 
 So you are just as bent as that other cop. 
 What other policeman? 
 Ray Shithead. 
 That asshole on TV. 
 Yeah. 
 Ray Stanton? 
 Yes. He pulled a gun on Lola. 
 Ray Stanton threatened you? 
 Destination in 500m. 
 You have reached your destination. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Man : Josh? Where are you? 
 Mate, did you get those coordinates I sent you? 
 Something's up. I need backup. 
 Mate, uh, I thought you'd want to know. 
 I've got a match on that 888 tattoo. 
 Terry Boke, convicted of a messed-up murder back in '92. 
 Wait there. 
 And the thing about this Boke guy? 
 The arresting officer was Ray Stanton. 
 sh1t. 
 OK. I've got to go. 
 Hands! 
 Let me see hands out the window! 
 Aargh! 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Out, out, out! 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Lola! Lola! 
 Keep going! 
 (SQUEALS) 
 There's no way out! 
 Here, try this. 
 (RATTLING) 
 Aarggh! 
 We're going to have to split up. 
 What? 
 He can't chase both of us. 
 No! 
 Chelsea, please. 
 There's a river down there. 
 I'll meet you down there. 
 I can't! 
 I'm not going to leave you. 
 I'll be OK. I'll be OK. 
 OK, OK, OK, OK. OK. 
 I'll meet you at the river. 
 OK. 
 (MAN CONTINUES TO SLASH CANE) 
 Man : (ON RADIO) That request for backup to the cane fields, just need to confirm you're en route. 
 Man : (ON RADIO) Copy that. 
 ETA five minutes. 
 Police! Get out of the car now! 
 Pleased to finally meet you, Lola.
