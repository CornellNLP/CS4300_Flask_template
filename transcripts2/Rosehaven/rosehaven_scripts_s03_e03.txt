 Emma: Why do I get the heavy end? 
  Daniel: My end's just as heavy! 
  Where does it go? 
  Mum, where do you want the couch? 
  Barbara: In the living room. 
  Yes, I know. 
  Where in the living room? 
  Near the front window. 
  Well, where are you putting the TV? 
  In front of the couch. 
  [Groans] 
  Are you sure you want the TV facing the window? 
  Because when the sun shines... 
  I'm putting it down! 
  Use your legs. 
  [Both groan] 
  [Sighs] 
  What's wrong? 
  I'm just a little miffed Mum never told me she wanted to sell. 
  I mean, I wasn't living there anymore, but I grew up there. 
  I didn't find out until she'd already sold the place. 
  If it makes you feel better, as her housemate, and I assume best friend, I too was left in the dark. 
  How's your new room? 
  Oh, it's fine. 
  Barbara took the one with the ensuite. 
  Even though I called shotgun. 
  I would just use that toilet anyway and I would look her in the eye as you use it. 
  Just leave the door wide open. 
  Mmm. 
  Didn't you talk to her about it? 
  I mean, I'd want to know if my mum and dad were selling. 
  I've still got a bunch of Lego at their place. 
  Mum just dumped all my stuff in a cardboard box. 
  At least she didn't sell it. 
  Or find your p0rn mags. 
  Oh, I didn't think of that. 
  You mean there were p0rn mags? 
  No. 
  Gross. 
  I said no. 
  Dirty boy! 
  There were no p0rn mags. 
  Filthy... 
  No. 
  ... dirty... 
  Hey, sorry I'm late. 
  Hey. 
  Have you been lifting with your legs? 
  We have. 
  OK. 
  So, I was trying to get my 10,000 steps up this morning... 
  But that's not important right now. 
  Although, it is important... 
  Anyway, I found something I think you should see. 
  What's happening? 
  I don't like walking this fast unless I have to pee. 
  Or if I'm trying to get to the car first to lock Daniel out. 
  Here. 
  Oh, God! 
  What does "RRR" mean? 
  Redheaded... 
  Rat-Rooter. 
  [Laughs] 
  Sorry. 
  Bruce used to call me this at school. 
  He said he wrote it on the concrete when we were in grade five but refused to tell me where. 
  I thought he was bluffing. 
  Well, we can just change the meaning. 
  To... 
  Royal... 
  Redhead of the... 
  Realm. 
  Or... 
  Radical Robot... 
  No, I'll know what it means. 
  I have to get rid of it. 
  I think it's cool. 
  It's like your own star on the Walk of Fame. 
  Yeah, except it's on the pavement in Rosehaven and it says I root rats. 
  [Cackles] 
  Sorry. 
  ♪ Yeah, we know ♪ ♪ Even if we had so far to go ♪ ♪ Even if the pace is slow ♪ ♪ Well, I'll be coming home to you again ♪ ♪ If we find ♪ ♪ Something to feel that we belong ♪ ♪ If we could right all the wrongs ♪ ♪ Well, I'll be coming home to you again. 
  ♪ It's been there for 25 years. 
  Just pretend you never saw it. 
  I can't un-see it. 
  And I don't like how close it is to Mum's new place. 
  I'll think about it every time I'm over there. 
  Unbelievable! 
  Everything OK? 
  I'm going to pick up some supplies for tonight. 
  What's happening tonight? 
  Jenny's coming! 
  She just called to tell me she's driving down. 
  Right now. 
  Could have given me some bloody notice! 
  I can relate to that. 
  Who's that? 
  My sister. 
  Oh, my God! 
  Your sister is coming? 
  She's staying in town tonight. 
  We're all having dinner together. 
  Seven o'clock. 
  OK! 
  Call me if you see her. 
  [Shop bell chimes] 
  [Door closes] 
  Wow! 
  Barbara's sister? 
  What's she like? 
  She's got to be tougher than Barbara if she's got her acting like that. 
  Does she ride a motorbike? 
  Is she a tattoo artist? 
  Body builder? 
  She might be now. 
  What do you mean? 
  How long since you've seen her? 
  Oh, 10-ish years. 
  I didn't have much to do with her growing up. 
  10 years? 
  Why so long? 
  Well, I've only heard Mum's side of the story, but according to her, it's none of my business. 
  Aren't you curious? 
  Well, yeah, but Mum never tells me anything, so... 
  [Blows raspberry] 
  Where are you going? 
  I'm gonna head out for a bit. 
  OK, well, if everyone's leaving, I'm leaving too. 
  Where are you going? 
  With you. 
  Oh. 
  [Shop bell chimes] 
  Welcome to Green Valley Council. 
  How can I help you? 
  Uh, we'd like to inquire about getting a public footpath reconcreted. 
  Please hold. 
  [Types] 
  OK. 
  They're coming. 
  Thanks. 
  [Door slides open] 
  You wanted Infrastructure and Amenities? 
  Uh, maybe. 
  I'd like to get a public footpath reconcreted. 
  OK. 
  Well, who am I speaking to? 
  Daniel McCallum. 
  And Emma Dawes. 
  That's Emma Dawes, not Em Adores. 
  Uh, whereabouts is this footpath? 
  Declan Avenue in Rosehaven. 
  And why does it need to be redone? 
  Uh, someone has carved an offensive slogan into the concrete. 
  Is it a safety hazard? 
  Well, I mean, you can't trip on it, but it's offensive. 
  Unless it's a safety hazard, then it's not policy to replace a footpath. 
  OK, so, if someone writes a comment into wet cement that the whole neighbourhood finds extremely offensive, you won't fix it? 
  What's the comment? 
  "Danny is an RRR." Redheaded rat-rooter. 
  [Sniggers] 
  What's your name again? 
  Daniel. 
  Danny for short. 
  And does the whole neighbourhood find this offensive, or just you? 
  Well, there could be other people in the neighbourhood called Daniel. 
  OK, well, maybe it is a tripping hazard. 
  I mean, if you're on rollerblades and your wheels get caught in one of the indents made by the letters, you could fall and hurt yourself. 
  We haven't received any complaints. 
  I'm complaining. 
  I'm sorry, but I can't help you. 
  What if we fix it ourselves? 
  You can't. 
  It has to be done by a council-approved tradesperson and we have to approve the work. 
  OK, well, you just lost my vote. 
  I'm not an elected official. 
  Well, whoever hired you has lost my vote. 
  I'm not hired by an elected... 
  Well, have fun scraping a bunch of dead rollerbladers off the pavement! 
  We might go. 
  Went too far, didn't I? 
  Just a bit. 
  Maybe we call them and pretend to be other people in the neighbourhood who also want it fixed. 
  I can do a British accent. 
  They'd never buy it. 
  [Bad Cockney accent] 
  But what if I can do a real good one? 
  Ugh! 
  You do one. 
  Um... 
  [Bad Midlands accent] 
  Are you gonna eat that muffin? 
  Oh, you're right. 
  Oh! 
  That was really good. 
  Whew! 
  Am I in England?! 
  Daniel! 
  Oh, my goodness. 
  Is that you? 
  Hi. 
  Aunty Jenny. 
  Yeah. 
  [Laughs] 
  You've grown into a very handsome man. 
  Oh, uh... 
  uh, thank you. 
  And who's this lovely lady? 
  I'm Emma. 
  Nice to meet you. 
  I never get to meet any of Daniel's family. 
  Apart from Barbara, obviously. 
  Us McCallums tend to spread out. 
  Can conquer more ground that way. 
  I'm in Hobart. 
  Ooh, the city! 
  What are you doing here, Daniel? 
  You're not working here, are you? 
  Uh, yes. 
  Yes, I am. 
  Well, good for you! 
  [Chuckles] 
  Barbara doesn't tell me very much, I'm afraid. 
  She must be very proud of you. 
  Yeah... 
  Are you two a... 
  couple? 
  Both: No! 
  Daniel begged me to leave the mainland to come help him out. 
  Well, I didn't even ask, but... 
  [Chuckles] 
  So Barbara has her own little team. 
  She's doing so well. 
  I feel like deep down she knows how lucky she is. 
  Can you believe she sold the house? 
  [Chuckles] 
  I was very surprised. 
  You... 
  didn't know she was selling? 
  [Door closes] 
  No, but she knows more about real estate than me. 
  Oh. 
  Hello, Jen. 
  Babs! 
  So good to see you. 
  "Babs"! 
  You look well. 
  Really well. 
  You too. 
  How about we have a seat in my office? 
  Ooh. 
  The office! 
  [Chuckles] 
  Sounds lovely. 
  [Door closes] 
  Aunty Jenny didn't know either. 
  Do you think Barbara will let me call her Babs? 
  I want to be there the first time you try it. 
  The office looks different. 
  Barbara: We've moved. 
  Oh. 
  So strange being back here after so long. 
  I was happy to find the bakery still makes the best vanilla slice around. 
  I'm more of a hedgehog woman myself. 
  So... 
  you sold our house. 
  I did. 
  Can I ask why? 
  I wanted to move and it was a seller's market. 
  Don't suppose you thought of telling me? 
  I did tell you. 
  [Chuckles] 
  After you sold it! 
  But the thing is... 
  correct me if I'm wrong, it was left to both of us. 
  Mum made me the sole executor. 
  I didn't need your permission. 
  I don't think a phone call was too much to ask. 
  I'm the one who took over the repayments. 
  And I made sure you got your fair share of the sale. 
  Yes. 
  Thank you very much. 
  You've always been better with money than me. 
  It's just that... 
  this isn't about the money, is it? 
  God! 
  I want to know what they're saying! 
  I'm gonna go do some work. 
  So you can hear them through the glass? 
  Smart. 
  I'm gonna 'do work' too. 
  Wait, is that Grace's? 
  No. 
  Maybe. 
  She's got loads. 
  What's your plan? 
  Put it on the wall? 
  It's glass. 
  They'll see you. 
  I was gonna duck down. 
  Just grab a pen or something and... 
  Did Mum's radio survive the move, or did you sell that too? 
  Of course not! 
  Good. 
  I want it. 
  What? 
  I want Mum's radio. 
  Well, you can't have it. 
  I'm the one who's been dusting it for years. 
  Well, I'm happy to take over that burden for you. 
  It's fine, thanks. 
  I've gotten very good at it. 
  You've had it for ages. 
  It's my turn. 
  You only want it because I'm using it. 
  You have to share. 
  You'll break it. 
  Is this about Daisy Dalmatian still? 
  The tail was loose! 
  It wasn't loose. 
  You pulled it off. 
  Well, a radio doesn't have a tail. 
  You're not getting it! 
  Temper. 
  Oh, I've just got a standard room at the pub. 
  There isn't even a minibar. 
  What if minibars had mini bartenders? 
  Making mini cocktails? 
  You could have stayed here. 
  I didn't want to put you out. 
  You've just moved. 
  Um... 
  Mum, would you be able to speak to someone you know at the council for me? 
  Why? 
  I want to get a slab of concrete replaced. 
  What for? 
  You know how Bruce used to call me a redheaded... 
  Rat-rooter, yeah. 
  [Laughs] 
  Well, when we were little, he wrote "Danny is an RRR" into wet cement, and it's still there. 
  So? 
  So, it's insulting. 
  And the council won't let me change it unless it's a safety hazard. 
  That's awful! 
  Well, if it's not in their policy to fix it, nothing I say will change that. 
  Yeah, but they won't even let me fix it myself. 
  So, let it go. 
  It's OK to be emotional. 
  Like me. 
  I didn't think I'd be so affected about losing my childhood home. 
  Maybe because it came as such a shock. 
  Can we just have dinner? 
  I'm just curious to know what you all think. 
  Should Babs have told me about the sale beforehand? 
  I might be wrong. 
  Fine. 
  Who wants to weigh in? 
  Daniel? 
  Um... 
  well... 
  Actually, a bit of notice would have been nice. 
  Well, I-I was talking to Grace before a-and she agrees. 
  You have thoughts too, Grace? 
  I think... 
  that I have finished my dinner and I'm gonna go put my plate in the sink. 
  How about you, Emma? 
  Mmm! 
  All done! 
  She didn't tell you either? 
  That must have hurt. 
  Um... 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, it... 
  it did. 
  Neither of you were living at the place and I was the one who took care of it, alone, for God knows how many years. 
  Now, if I want to move, I'm allowed to move! 
  Don't you get sentimental about anything? 
  Just another house to sell, was it? 
  I'm sick of talking about this. 
  What's done is done. 
  And if you're both gonna keep on going on about it, I'm going to bed! 
  That's not a very mature way to handle things! 
  [Door slams] 
  We have every right to be upset. 
  Yeah. 
  Even growing up, she always had to be right. 
  I was a public servant. 
  I'll call the council for you. 
  They may not be willing to reconcrete it, but I'm sure I'll be able to get you permission to change it yourself. 
  Really? 
  Oh, that'd be great. 
  Thank you. 
  It's no hassle. 
  And to be honest... 
  I was actually hoping you could do me a favour. 
  Are you super-duper sure you want to give Barbara's stuff to Jenny without asking? 
  If Mum were sentimental about stuff, she wouldn't have sold the house so quickly and just shoved all my stuff in a box. 
  OK. 
  If you're sure. 
  Stop me if I go to buy a custard tart. 
  You got it. 
  Jenny: Good morning! 
  Hi. 
  Oh. 
  Morning. 
  Do you want a coffee or anything? 
  My treat. 
  Oh, no, it's fine. 
  You don't have to. 
  Please. 
  Um... 
  uh, can I get a long black, please? 
  Mikayla, do you have any almond milk yet? 
  No. 
  It tastes terrible and no-one wants to drink it but you. 
  Well, if I brought some in, could you make my coffee with it? 
  No. 
  Weak long black, please. 
  I've got good news. 
  I spoke to the council this morning. 
  I've got you approval to fix the concrete yourself. 
  It's not as good as them fixing it, but the best I could manage, I'm afraid. 
  No, no, that's great. 
  Thank you. 
  Don't suppose you had any luck with the radio? 
  Uh, maybe. 
  Is this it? 
  Yes! 
  That's it! 
  Oh, thank you! 
  Oh, I'm so glad you found it. 
  I thought she might have thrown it out. 
  Oh, no worries. 
  Now we just have to figure out how to get the footpath reconcreted. 
  Well, it seems to me the boy that did it should pay for it. 
  Mmm. 
  Thank you! 
  Thank you. 
  Did you want anything else? 
  A custard tart, please. 
  Two. 
  [Knock at door] 
  Yeah, it's open. 
  Come in. 
  Danny. 
  What are you doing here? 
  [Groans] 
  Em, if you're here to convince me to go on another date with you, you've got to let me go, it's over. 
  I don't want to go on another date with you. 
  Pfft! 
  [Laughs] 
  I wish we'd never gone on the first one! 
  Yeah, Bruce, can I talk to you for a second? 
  Sorry, mate. 
  A little bit busy here. 
  We're down to the last couple of players. 
  Mate, revive me. 
  Yep, yep. 
  Can you pause it, please? 
  No, it's an online match. 
  You can't pause real life, mate. 
  I found your message in the cement. 
  What message? 
  "Danny is an RRR." Redheaded rat-rooter! 
  [Laughs] 
  What?! 
  I did that ages ago. 
  Did you only just find it? 
  Yes, and I want you to pay to have it reconcreted. 
  What? 
  You should pay to have it replaced. 
  Mate, I was 10. 
  Well, you still did the wrong thing, so... 
  And a rollerblader could trip on it. 
  I rollerblade. 
  What? 
  Do you? 
  Yeah. 
  You don't fall off that easily. 
  And if you do, you shouldn't be on the blades. 
  Yeah, sorry, can we get back to it? 
  Yeah, sorry, mate, I can't help you. 
  I did that ages ago and I don't call you a redheaded rat-rooter anymore, so... 
  we're even. 
  No, we're not! 
  Revive me! 
  Yeah, stop running off on your own! 
  Run! 
  Hey! 
  Whoo! 
  That looks great. 
  Yeah. 
  Nice and flat. 
  Oddly satisfying. 
  Thank you so much for this, Damien. 
  No worries. 
  It'll take a while to dry, though. 
  So, how have you been? 
  I'll get going. 
  Oh, sorry. 
  Um... 
  I can stay. 
  Oh. 
  No. 
  What? 
  Oh, no, nothing. 
  Um... 
  oh, we should get back to it too. 
  OK. 
  Um... 
  I'll go. 
  Um... 
  thanks again, mate. 
  No worries. 
  I'll take one of those. 
  Bye. 
  [Starts engine] 
  You OK? 
  Yeah. 
  Why? 
  Oh, I just thought, seeing Damien again... 
  I mean, you seem fine. 
  I was. 
  You could have kissed him in front of me. 
  Wouldn't have cared. 
  Yeah, cool. 
  It's just, you don't have to hide it from me if it still hurts. 
  It doesn't. 
  I shook his hand. 
 
 
 
  Yeah, you're right. 
  Very normal interaction. 
  What you doing, Danny? 
  Nothing. 
  Is that new concrete? 
  What do you want, Bruce? 
  Just driving past to have a look at my handiwork. 
  Part of Rosehaven's rich heritage. 
  Yeah, well, it's gone now, so... 
  Right. 
  So, you're both just gonna stand there until the cement dries? 
  I'm not gonna touch it, mate. 
  I was 10. 
  We enjoy standing here. 
  We're probably gonna make it a regular hangout spot. 
  Yeah, and there's a car coming now. 
  [Horn honks] 
  So you should probably move on. 
  Don't appreciate you turning off our game. 
  I only turned off the TV, mate. 
  I'm not a monster. 
  The game would have still been going when you turned it back on. 
  Yeah, but Maddrick bled out and we lost the match! 
  Oh, I'm real sorry, mate! 
  He's gonna try and rewrite it. 
  Yes, he is. 
  Well, I've never seen you do it. 
  That doesn't prove anything. 
  I brush my hair every day. 
  Why? 
  Does it do anything? 
  Yes! 
  It's just... 
  I can't imagine it would look any different if you hadn't have brushed it. 
  It looks way different. 
  You wouldn't recognise me. 
  I think I'd still be able to pick you out of a line-up. 
  No. 
  How long till it dries? 
  I need to go to the toilet. 
  Yeah, me too. 
  Well, you can just go in a bush. 
  It's a number two. 
  Yuck! 
  Oh, you've never pooed before? 
  I'm gonna go ask one of these houses. 
  Can you ask for me too, please? 
  There is no way I am combining my polite pee with your gross number two. 
  Please? 
  Go dig a hole somewhere. 
  [Groans] 
  What are you doing? 
  I'm, uh... 
  waiting for some wet concrete to dry. 
  And why would you be doing that? 
  In case Bruce comes back. 
  So you got it fixed? 
  I thought I said to leave it alone. 
  Well, Aunty Jenny convinced the council to let me change it, so... 
  I changed it. 
  Did she also convince you to give her my radio? 
  She thought you were gonna throw it out. 
  Of course not! 
  As usual, she's just being manipulative to get her own way. 
  Well, she's been nothing but lovely to me. 
  I don't know what she was like growing up, but people can change. 
  Not her. 
  It's an act. 
  Well, why do you care about a radio? 
  It's not like anything has sentimental value to you. 
  I mean, my room, you just packed it up and then gave me a box. 
  Those are your things. 
  And no, I don't have a sentimental attachment to your comic books and p0rn mags. 
  Oh, there were p0rn mags. 
  Get in the car. 
  You gave it to her, you can get it back. 
  No. 
  Excuse me? 
  [Sighs] 
  I... 
  I'm gonna stay until it dries. 
  I don't want a reminder of how much I got bullied etched into the concrete again. 
  You could paint that concrete with rainbows and you'd still be reminded about how you got bullied. 
  You have to move on yourself. 
  I can't just let go of stuff like you, Mum. 
  This concrete means something to me. 
  Like the house meant something to me. 
  Same with Aunty Jenny. 
  I mean, what about the business? 
  Are you just gonna sell that one day without telling me? 
  Hey, Barbara. 
  Uh, No. 
  2 said you could use their toilet. 
  What are the odds? 
  Number two. 
  What did I miss? 
  You'd better go deal with that. 
  Get out of it, you mongrel! 
  Hey! 
  You're done for! 
  Go! 
  Get going! 
  Did you make it in time? 
  Success. 
  Did Bruce come back? 
  Nah. 
  I'm too intimidating. 
  Plus, I've been turning on the spot to keep an eye in all directions. 
  Hey, uh, I was thinking... 
  While you were on the toilet? 
  Gross. 
  Don't want to know. 
  No, no, I was thinking... 
  I should write it back in. 
  What? 
  Well, if I can't dismiss stuff like Mum can, maybe I should embrace it. 
  I mean, if I hadn't have gone through what I went through as a kid, I might not have Grace in my life. 
  Or you. 
  This is part of that. 
  That was a real nice thing you said. 
  Thanks. 
  But you can feel that way and not have "Danny is a redheaded rat-rooter" engraved in concrete. 
  You're right. 
  That was dumb. 
  Hey, you didn't laugh at "redheaded rat-rooter". 
  [Cackles] 
  Never mind. 
  [Laughs] 
  I mean... 
  Oh! 
  Thanks for coming. 
  I wasn't sure you would. 
  That's OK. 
  I thought you were gonna let me leave without saying goodbye. 
  [Door opens] 
  One second. 
  OK, tomorrow, come in without brushing it and we'll see if it looks any different. 
  Why do you think I buy hair gel? 
  Daniel? 
  Come in here, please. 
  Hi. 
  It was my house and my choice. 
  It happened quickly. 
  I was given a good offer and I took it. 
  I'm getting too old to look after all that land. 
  I should have called you first before I sold it. 
  It was left to both of us. 
  Well. 
  This is a surprise. 
  You too. 
  You grew up there. 
  You deserved to know. 
  Um... 
  thank you. 
  I'm sorry. 
  To both of you. 
  I know that can't have been easy for you, Babs. 
  And I can see that you've really grown from this experience. 
  Thanks. 
  I wasn't sure at first, but I'm really glad I made the trip. 
  It was very lovely meeting you, Emma. 
  You too! 
  Maybe one day you can meet my sister's housemate. 
  Um... 
  Doesn't matter. 
  [Phone rings] 
  Hello? 
  McCallum Real Estate. 
  Mrs. 
  Marsh. 
  Bye, Jen. 
  Daniel. 
  All the best. 
  Bye, Aunty Jenny. 
  Thanks again for all your help. 
  You're very welcome. 
  Oh. 
  Until next time, Babs. 
  Are we a hug or a handshake now? 
  [Chuckles] 
  Right. 
  No, I don't think so. 
  Bye! 
  Bye. 
  [Shop bell chimes] 
  Mum, I think this is the first time I've changed your mind about something. 
  And I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but... 
  this is a huge deal. 
  Daniel, that was the council. 
  The council? 
  Yeah. 
  They said they'll be sending you a bill to have the concrete redone. 
  Why? 
  They said you "illegally altered public works". 
  No, no. 
  Aunty Jenny got me approval to fix it. 
  Told you. 
  She's a liar. 
  Hasn't changed. 
  No, but... 
  but she said... 
  Oh, God! 
  [Shop bell chimes] 
  Did I forget something? 
  No, no, Aunty Jenny, when you spoke to the council... 
  I'm sorry? 
  The council, to get me approval to fix the concrete. 
  Who'd you speak to? 
  I never called the council. 
  You said you did. 
  I don't remember that. 
  No, no, we were at the bakery and you said you got me approval. 
  I'm very sorry, Daniel, but I don't think I did. 
  I really have to get going. 
  It was lovely seeing you again. 
  No, no, no, Aunty Jenny... 
  Aunty Jenny, the council... 
  [Starts engine] 
  Uh, A-Aunty Jenny, you said you spoke to them. 
  [Tyres squeal] 
  [Shop bell chimes] 
  What happened? 
  She just... 
  denied it. 
  I... 
  I'm not making it up. 
  Emma and I were both there. 
  She said she'd done it, then I had a custard tart. 
  She's a liar! 
  I know. 
  She's always been that way. 
  Why do you think I don't keep in touch? 
  Oh! 
  I gave her your radio. 
  Mrs. 
  Marsh? 
  I got her to grab it out of Jen's bag while we were in my office. 
  Is that why you called us in? 
  No. 
  You both deserved an apology. 
  But it's my bloody radio. 
  Always two moves ahead. 
  Nice one, Babs. 
  Nup. 
  Got it. 
  But... 
  [Sighs] 
  I d... 
  I'm sorry, mate. 
  Looks the same. 
  Just admit you don't know where we are. 
  I will not admit that. 
  Push harder! 
  I'm not saving my strength for anything! 
  We are gonna die out here, aren't we? 
  Hello? 
  G'day. 
  We're in the middle of nowhere and there's a guy out there who neither of us could beat in a fight. 
  Speak for yourself. 
  I would just like us to have some sort of phrase or signal that means 'run back to the car'. 
  What? 
  We have to go now! 
  Council worker: I'm sorry, you'll have to pay to have it reconcreted. 
  It's already been reconcreted. 
  My Aunty Jenny said I had approval. 
  I never received a call from a Jenny in reference to this. 
  Yes, I know. 
  She lied to me. 
  I was tricked. 
  So it's... 
  not really my fault. 
  Tell you what. 
  We'll reconcrete the slab you altered... 
  Yes? 
  ... and you pay us the cost of having it redone. 
  [Sighs] 
  Plus a fine. 
  Oh! 
  [Bad Cockney accent] 
  My name's Jenny and I did call you! 
  I said 'ello! 
  Stop.
