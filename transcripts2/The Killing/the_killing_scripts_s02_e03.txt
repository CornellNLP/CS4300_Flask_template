 Previously on AMC's The Killing... 
 Got anything in the school locker? 
 What about Mitch? We've got to tell them something. She is their mom. 
 I swapped the bags and I gave him my bag, and then he lied about the test results. 
 We got to tell IA about Oakes. 
 You think you got this job because you're a good cop? 
 It's because you're dirty. 
 He's no longer a suspect in the case of the murder of Rosie Larsen. 
 Rosie's killer, he's still out there. 
 Kill him. 
 Open the door, Linden!

 We have Rosie Larsen in the casino 12:37 AM friday night. 
 There are hundreds of potential witnesses, people who may have known her. 
 Killer could be a regular. 
 I need that warrant. 
 Casino's probably the abduction site. 
 Then talk to the bureau of Indian affairs yourself. 
 I need to get in there. 
 What is this? 
 Rosie's super-8 film. Caught it in the bike mirror. 
 Oh, and welcome back. 
 New world order here with Oakes gone, right? 
 Did you hear about last night? 
 It's been crazy in this place. You run it? 
 Yeah, Holder asked me to. 
 It's not a gang tat, doesn't come up on any priors. 
 It's a manga, Japanese comic book character called "Ogi Jun." 
 He find out anything else about it? 
 Ask him yourself, I don't know. 
 Is Holder here? 
 Haven't seen him. 
 Hmm. 
 It doesn't look like a Beau Soleil type. 
 You get the client list off their servers yet? 
 Servers? 
 I filed the warrant two days ago for those Beau Soleil computers. 
 Lieutenant Carlson must have held them up. 
 The guy's a**l about paperwork. 
 Let the sergeant know. 
 Rosie Larsen was inside the Wapi Eagle casino the night she was killed. 
 It's a hotbed for Beau Soleil activity, the same online hooker ring which employed her. 
 Is there anything else you need, lieutenant? 
 We've got a lot of eyes on us right now, not a lot of room for error. 
 What's the holdup? Everything was in my paperwork. 
 I know, Detective. I read your report. 
 Next time, ask. 
 [ Sighs ] Hi, Stephen. 
 What's up, Claire? 
 Ohh. 
 My kid had an asthma attack, spent two days in the hospital, which, it turns out, is a great place to score. 
 But I got three days. 
 You got a light? 
 Hmm. 
 Haven't seen you at this meeting in awhile. 
 You talk to gil lately? 
 No. 
 I told my sponsor I missed it. 
 She said that goes away after awhile. 
 Lying bitch. 
 [ Sighs ] Except for the losing-my-kids part, there's nothing like it in the world. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Man: Come on, people. Let's go. 
 Meeting's about to start. 
 Mm. I guess we should go in? 
[ Sniffs ] 
 Yeah, I-I'll be in in a second. 
 I'll save you a seat. 
 All right, thanks. 
 Okay. 
 [ Indistinct conversation ] 
 [ Door closes ] 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 [ Keys jingle ] 
 Needs gas. 
 I was, uh, thinking of bringing the boys to the pumpkin patch today. 
 No, they should go to school. 
 You sure, Stan? 
 Because what about everything-- 
 We don't have to worry about it. 
 I worked it out. 
 At least the press are finally out of here. 
 Councilman's not a suspect no more so they don't give a damn about Rosie. 
 Yeah. Assholes. 
 [ Car approaches ] 
 Bo are gonna be late for school. 
 Do you want me to get 'em up? 
 No. I'll do it. 
[ Car door closes ] 
 Sarah: Excuse me. Mr. Larsen? 
 I'm done talking to you people. 
 I don't need your help no more. 
 I just need a minute of your time, Mr. Larsen. 
 Have you seen this tattoo? 
 Does it belong to the guy that killed my daughter now? 
 Not the one you arrested? 
 I need you to look at this picture. 
 Mrs. Larsen should look at it. Too. 
 Detective, my best friend is dead. 
 My sons are scared out of their minds. 
 My littlest one-- 
 He saw his own sister's blood on that backpack. 
 You try explaining that to an 8-year-old. 
 And your partner just says, "Oh, don't worry, it's nothing"? 
 I don't know what Detective Holder told you. 
 I want her backpack. 
 I want all of Rosie's stuff back. 
 I understand that you do. 
 What was in the backpack... that you would like back? 
 Jesus. Don't you people even talk to each other? 
 Get out of here. 
 Yeah, Jeff, it's Linden. 
 Did Holder bring down a piece of evidence in the Larsen case, a backpack? 
 Yeah, I need to sign off on it. He forgot. 
 I'll pick it up right now. 
 What do you mean it's gone? 
 Well, who took it? 
 [ Monitor beeping ] 
 [ Sighing ] 
 Incision is healing nicely and your blood pressure's down. 
 So when can I start rehab? 
 I'm already sick of this place... 
 Charming as it may be. 
 Yes, but with a complete injury like this... 
 I understand. 
 But I felt something in my right foot-- 
 A mild burning. 
 And this morning, I felt the sun on my legs. 
 Mr. Richmond, patients often experience some pain in their legs, but usually it's phantom pain, a sensory phenomenon-- 
 I know what phantom pain is. 
 That's not what I have. 
 I felt the warmth of the sun on my legs. 
 It wasn't pain. 
 Okay, well, I will let your neurologist know and have him stop by tonight. 
 Let's see how it goes. 
 Thanks. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All this morphine they have me on, Jamie, it's no wonder I haven't felt anything. 
 Yeah, well, you need it. 
 I think it's better if I lay off, at least until the neurologist gets here. 
 I want to have a clear head. 
 [ Chuckling ] 
 What's up, little man? 
 Uncle Steve! 
 How you been, baller? You keeping it real? 
 Fo sho. 
 You slaying them ladies with your ill lady skills? 
 Hells yeah! 
[ Laughing ] 
 So, how-- How's your moms? She-- she miss me? 
 I don't know. 
 Hop-- hop in, D. I'll give you a ride. 
 It ain't no trouble. I mean, what's it like, two blocks? 
 Come on. Jump in. Take a load off. 
 Put your little feet up. 
 I mean, damn, son, them dogs ain't little. 
 I'm not supposed to. 
 No, that's okay. I-I-- 
See, that was before. 
 You know, I talked to your moms, and she-- 
She said it's cool. 
 That's okay. You-- 
You listen to your mom. 
 Go on. 
 Are you mad at me? 
 Never, lil' man. 
 You hear? 
 Never. 
 Go on. 
 Jake's mom made his costume out of a ladder. 
 It weighs 40 pounds. 
 He's gonna be a grandfather clock. 
 Who's got that kind of time? 
 Get it? 
 [ Laughs ] 
Tommy, did you get it? 
 Did you? 
 Okay, go on now. It's cold. 
 Your dad will pick you up today. 
 Aunt Terry's got to make some money. Okay? 
 What-- What-- 
What's wrong? 
 He does it with mom. It's stupid. 
 What is it? 
 Denny, it's okay. What-- What is it? 
 You can show me. 
 You're supposed to kiss 'em. 
 Okay. Give me them paws. 
 What about you, punk? 
 No way. 
 You sure? Yep. 
 I'm here for Rosie's backpack. 
 I don't have it. 
 What are you doing walking off with evidence, Loo? 
 I'm not your lieutenant anymore. 
 You should think about what's gonna matter to you when this is all over, Sarah, when you're not a cop. 
 Yeah, and what about the Larsens? 
 What do you think matters to them? 
 Half this job is about doing what you're told. 
 I need my pension, Sarah. 
 I still need that bag. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Look, you want to think this is personal, you go ahead. 
 I got a lot of other things to worry about, you included. 
 No, I got my own back, thanks. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Plastic crinkling ] 
 We had a good run, Sarah. 
 I hope you remember that. 
 Yeah, loo. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Zipper opens ] 
 [ Darren grunting ] 
 [ Monitor beeping ] 
 I could send these to that nurse, say it's from you. 
 Ha. 
 [ Groans ] 
 Darren... Take the damn morphine. 
 I'll live, Jamie. 
 [ TV turns on ] 
 You ever seen "hoarders"? 
 People living on mounds of garbage, using plastic bags as toilets. 
 It's hilarious. Turn it back. 
 I want to see it. 
 ...waterfront project is still a viable option for Seattle's economic growth. 
 And, as you know, I have eight years of experience resolving this type of bureaucratic dispute Some scrappy, devilishly handsome political genius must have taken a swipe at him. [ Sighs ] Didn't know you had that in you. Well, I'm a man of mystery. [ Laughs ] There're still a lot of questions about the Councilman's whereabouts on that night, but that's not for me to answer. [  Reports shouting questions  ] Where's that damned neurologist? I'll find out. Okay. [  Reporters shouting questions  ] That's speculation. [ Groans ] Now, that's a good question. All right. I will answer that-- [  "Right Down The Line"  plays ] ♪ You brought me into the light ♪ Here you go. Thank you. ♪ Threw away all those crazy dreams ♪

She needed to go, Ter. She wasn't happy. Happy? Who the hell's happy? Are you happy? 'Cause... I'm sure as hell not happy. Hey. Come on, Stan. Hey, it's easy to get swallowed up in all of this, you know. [ Sighs ] You should go be with your friends. You want to take a few days, do it. The boys will be okay. No, they won't. I won't do that to them. [ Film projector clicking ] [ Ringing ] Holder:  Yo, it's me. Leave a message. Where are you, Holder? Look, I know what you did... With the backpack and why you came by last night. I get it. We need to talk, so call me back, please. [ Cellphone beeps ] Linden... Went to serve your Beau Soleil warrant at the shoe place. There was a fire there early this morning. The whole place was torched. Come with me. [ Siren wailing ] [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Police radio chatter ] Seattle pd. Were the computers damaged? What computers? The place was hosting a website. There were servers in the basement. All we got here are 200 pairs of roasted sneakers. No computers. Arson? Hey, come on! Keep those people back! Man: I'm on it. It was probably an accident. Electrical fire. Faulty wiring. Rain didn't help. Anybody talk to the owner? Couldn't get ahold of him. One of the neighbors called the fire in. Yeah, copy that. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Duncan! I need you to canvass every camera within a four-block radius of this place. I need everything from the last 24 hours. Come on, Linden, it was electrical. Just do it. I'll get the warrants. [ Bell ringing ] [ Children playing ] Hey, what you got there, Denny? Patch-key! It's Polish pastry. It's Paczki. Is today somebody's birthday? I told him not to take it. Well, who gave it to you, then, bud? The big guy. Your friend. What friend? You're gonna sit with me. Yeah. 
 
 [ Exhales sharply ] Hey. We had a deal. Damian, say hello to Stan. [ Chuckling ] Shy but handsome. 3 years old. Almost a man. Hmm? [ Laughs ] Go play. [ Sighs ] Respectfully, Janek, keep my boys out of this. My kids don't know a thing about my old life. They're good boys. You were a good boy, too. I had high hopes for you. The cops are saying that Rosie worked for something called Beau Soleil. It's an online, uh, prostitution service. I'll look into it. I just wanted to meet your children, Stan, after all these years. They look like you. [ Laughs ] [ Knock on door, dog barking ] What?! Is logic here? You a cop? Just go get him! Tyler, you got company! Logic: Mom, shut up, please! I got friends here, mom! Get out of my house! Sorry, bro. Bitch won't let up. Huh. Shut up, Tyler get out of my house! Rent ain't free! Yeah, yeah. [ Sighs ] Haven't seen you around. Yeah, well, you know. Got clean, blah, blah, blah. Oh, damn, you a NA Nazi now? Bitch made me go once. Bunch of raggedy-assed tweakers, slaying the doughnuts. Me? No, I'm not gonna live like that. I want the good life. You feel me? The crib is my castle. Yeah, you got all kinds of good life up in here. [ Coughs ] [ Sniffs ] So, if you ain't buying, why are you here, then? You making amends? "I'm sorry, logic, I forgot to pay you for that gram." Yeah. "Oh, yeah, and, logic, I'm sorry I banged Ashley, even though you liked her." Just shut your mouth, all right? [ Laughing ] Well, go ahead. I'm waiting, fool. Tell me what you done. I'm a cop, you stupid son of a bitch. I was working your ass. Oh, yeah? You know what, narc? Even junkie cops... Need dealers. Hmm? Is that what I need, huh? Is that what I need? Huh? Huh? Huh? I do, huh? Huh?! Is that what I need, huh? Huh? No! Get the hell off of him! I'm gonna call the cops! Don't you touch my boy! [ Gasps ] [ Laughing ] Yo, you hit my moms, fool! You're in for a world of hurt now. [ Laughing ] Watch out. Bitch is coming for you. [ Laughing ] And here? No. How about there? No. Okay, let me know if you experience the sensation you described to Dr. Madigan. How about right there? No. That. I felt that-- What you just did to my foot. That's good, right? I felt something. Uh, well, I'll have to review your case with Dr. Madigan before we can make a determination. You're in good hands with him. He's the best. There's no need for you to be in pain. Jamie, we got to get going on this rehab. We got to be running a campaign. Darren, that's the last thing you need to be worried about. [ Groans ] You need to rest up, get your strength back. Black church coalition is having a fundraiser on Friday. I want to be there to thank them for their support. No way, Darren. [ Groans ] I need a suit-- 
The blue pinstripe. It's in my hallway closet in the condo. You can get a key from Gwen. Okay. I'll call them. Tell them you're coming. Okay. It's a bad idea, by the way. Okay. Okay. [ Breathing heavily ] Hi. Thanks for coming. I know you-- 
You have a plane to catch. Sorry about Darren. If there's anything you need, Gwen... Uh, I think... It might be time for me to move on. I see. Well, there's an excellent alderman in Tacoma, pushing for a city council-- 
I could put you in touch. I was thinking more DC. What about Farrelly? Senator Farrelly. Are you gonna make me beg, dad? [ Dialing ] I've always said this city was too provincial for your talent. Are you calling him now? Guy's been trying to get you on board for years. I want to give him the good news right away. Mary: Senator Eaton's office. Mary, get Senator Farrelly on the line. I hope you're packed. He'll want you on a flight tonight. That was a killer sale. Anyway... They bought 10,000 chemistry books. So I'm in the mood to celebrate. How about you? Yep. Oh, Jesus, I'm doing all the talking here. I'm sorry, I do that. You're a Beautiful woman. [ Scoffs ] You shouldn't even be in a place like this. I mean, come on, a girl like you. Oh, I don't know. It's not so bad. Are you okay, Anna? Uh, I-I can go. I don't want you to go. I want you to stay. [ Indistinct conversation in distance ] How soon can you get me the footage outside the Beau Soleil building? I need it asap. Yeah, Ray, I know there's a lot of cameras. You shouldn't be talking on the phone while you're driving. It's illegal. You're right. That's true. No, Carlson doesn't need to know. It's an arson warrant, that's why. Just e-mail it as soon as it comes in. Oh, and have you seen Holder? Well, if you do, have him call me. It's important. [ Cellphone beeps ] I was thinking I'd cook something. Toasting's not cooking. Is everything okay with Holder? Yeah. Yes, everything's fine. "Ogi Jun." 
This book's awesome. You've read that? Yeah, you bought it for me. Isn't it really violent? Yeah, and tons of s*x, too. Hey. Ogi Jun's pitted against this guy who's got like 200,000 armies and killed his father right in an epic battle in front of him. He's revenging him. Avenging. Yeah, and he knows all these sick warrior moves that his sensei taught him, but then his sensei turns out to be this bad guy, but it doesn't matter 'cause he's already taught him everything. It's like, yeah, cool. Mr. Richmond, do you mind if I... Not at all. Come on in. I voted for you for city council. [ Chuckling ] Is that so? Mm-hmm. Hope I didn't disappoint. [ Chuckles ] Not at all. And how did I win the honor of your vote, uh... Katie? Well, I really liked your health that makes sense. [ Laughing ] And I liked your smile. [ Chuckling ] It's a politician's best weapon. Yeah. 
[ Chuckles ] What are you doing down there? All done. I changed your catheter. But I didn't even... I know. Don't worry. First week's the worst. You'll get used to it. See you in the morning, Mr. Richmond. [ Holder and Claire breathing heavily ] Hey. Hey. [ Sighing ] Hey... You got any? [ Water running ] [ Indistinct talking on radio ] I looked into this Beau Soleil. All Russian girls. No record of Rosie. The cops were wrong. [ Sighs deeply ] What are you doing here, Janek? My contact at the morgue gave me Rosie's file. The police-- They don't tell you the truth about how she died. Rosie was alive in that car when it went into the water. She tore off her own fingernails trying to escape. You should kill who did this. Keep it. [ Door opens, closes ] [ Cellphone ringing ] Hi, Ray. What's the status on those cameras? Ray: I'm e-mailing you the footage right now. We got 14 cameras worth of crap. I had to sift through hours of footage till I found anything. Sarah: I can't open the attachment. Click on the button that says "Download Attachment." Okay. It's working now. Yeah, it'll take a minute or two. You got it up yet? Yep. What am I looking at? Jewelry store camera. Storefront's glass, so they got eyes on the street. One block from Beau Soleil. Go to 2:34 AM. See the logo on the truck? You there? Sarah? There's more. I'm sending you a blowup of the driver. Look at his arm. [ Beep ] Hang on, Ray. I got another call. [ Cellphone beeps ] What? Claire: You got to come get him. Who is this? Stephen. I got your number from his phone. Look, I don't really know him, but he is acting crazy. Where are you? [ Horns blaring ] Sarah: What the hell are you doing?! [ Horn blares ] I know you switched the backpack! I know what you did, Holder! Come on! Get out of there before I leave you here! [ Monitor beeping ] [ Beeping ] [ Truck beeping ]
