 Councilman, councilman, did you know the murder victim, Rosie Larsen? 
 No, I did not. 
 Who was driving the vehicle she was found in? 
 Rosie Larsen's body was found  in the trunk of a car stolen from this campaign. 
 The police have asked me not to comment further. 
 Does it remind you of what happened to your wife, councilman? 
 This has nothing to do with that. 
 A young woman has been killed, someone's child. 
 This is not political. 
 It's about us doing all we can to help the police solve a senseless and brutal crime. 
 My heart goes out to the Larsen family for their terrible loss. 
 It was some party they were having down here. 
 Meth, oxy, booze. 
 Blood's a match to Rosie's type. 
 Larsen girl a user? 
 Won't get the tox screen back for a few days. 
 Didn't seem like it. 
 But if she was, could've been an O.D. 
 Whoever was with her panicked, dumped her. 
 I need you to work this thing, Sarah. 
 Can't do it. You know that. 
 It's gonna take some delicate maneuvering. 
 He can't do it. 
 I'm not staying. 
 Just till the end of the week. 
 I got City Hall on my ass on this thing. 
 You can't leave this with him. You know that. 
 Not my problem anymore. 
 Well, it is your problem, actually. 
 You're on the city's dime till the end of the week. 
 Look. 
 Clear this thing, I'm just an address on a Christmas card. 
 Principal Meyers. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Damn it! 
 You shouldn't have listened to the cop. 
 I told you. 
 That dead girl is gonna lead the 10:00 news and be on the front page of every paper in the state. 
 Where is he? 
 You lying son of a bitch. Ruth... 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Because the police asked me not to. 
 The car was stolen. It had nothing to do with us. 
 What? You think they care? 
 This is what those parasites feed on. 
 Chappaquiddick, Chandra Levy ring any bells? 
 Hey, we can control this, Ruth. Shut up! 
 By the time those whores are finished with you, you're gonna be the punch line of a dirty joke. 
 All right, I've had about enough of this. 
 Ruth, we can talk it through. Okay. 
 We can get through this. 
"We"? "We"? 
 Oh, no. There's no "we." 
 "We" are over. 
 We kept sports equipment down here years ago. 
 The kids called it "the cage." 
 It hasn't been used in ages. 
 Who else has keys to this place? 
 Besides me? 
 Just our janitor. 
 Damn. 
 Front-row seat. 
 What's his name... the janitor? 
 Lyndon Johnson Rosales. Why? 
 Thanks. 
 I'm hungry. 
 Aunt Terry's getting Chinese. 
 I hate Chinese. 
 Okay. Let's see what else we got here. 
 How about tuna fish? 
 I hate tuna. 
 Okay. 
 What do you boys want for dinner? 
 Chocolate-chip pancakes. 
 Pancakes are for breakfast, idiot. 
 Don't call your brother that. 
 We can have pancakes. 
 Chocolate-chip pancakes. All right. Here we go. 
 Should we wake up mom? 
 No, let mom sleep. She's tired, Denny. 
 We can make dinner ourselves. Right, boys? 
 Do you know how to make them, dad? 
 It's got to be on the back of the box, right? 
 How hard can it be? 
 Get me an egg and some milk, Tom. 
 Okay. 
 And... 
 Okay. Crack that egg, right in there, hmm? 
 All right. 
 Oop. Hmm? 
 You like crunchy ones, huh? 
 There we go. 
 How did Rosie die? 
 It's okay, dad. 
 We don't have to talk about it. 
 So, how long you staying this time? 
 You like the l.T.'s pet? 
 Maybe he just wants the case cleared. 
 M-maybe I didn't just find the crime scene. 
 Assumptions are your enemy, detective. 
 I'm lead on this for the next few days, so stop pressing everyone we question like they're in the box. 
 Let go of the idea that you have some B.S. detector. 
 And how do you know I don't have one of those? 
 'Cause you dress like Justin Bieber and eat pork rinds for dinner. 
 Ooh! Me and your kid got the same diet, Linden. 
 Ma'am? 
 We're with the Seattle P.D. 
 We're looking for a Lyndon Johnson Rosales. 
 No. No here. 
 We'd like to ask you a few questions. 
 Can we come in? 
 Is Lyndon your son? 
 Does he live here with you? 
 No Lyndon here. No. 
 He's not here? 
 'Cause we could... we could... we could wait. 
 Lady, you go, please. 
 Uh... 
 Look, uh, uh, we need to talk to your son. 
 Well, if he's not here, you know, I'm just gonna have a look around. 
 Mr. Rosales? 
 Holder! He's here! 
 Aah! 
 Put your weapon down right now! 
 Drop your weapon! Holder, back off! 
 Mr. Rosales, we just want to talk to you. 
 Lyndon! Lyndon! 
 Aah! 
 29-year-old male, fell from a third-story window, l.O.C. on arrival, depressed skull fracture. 
 This man's a suspect in a murder case. 
 When can I talk to him? 
 After surgery. 
 Councilman, councilman, did you know the murder victim, Rosie Larsen? 
 Who was driving the vehicle she was found in? 
 Rosie Larsen's body was found in the trunk of a car stolen from this campaign. 
 The police have asked me not to comment further.[/i] 
 EKG tech to E.R. 
 Dr. Warren to CCU. 
 Dr. Warren to CCU.[/i] 
 So, Rosales likes to show his junk to teenage girls. 
 Damn. 
 And he's got a kid-tiddlin' record and a couple of 311s. 
 School missed it. That's why he ran. 
 Because of his warrants, or because he killed the Larsen girl? 
 No, LBJ's alibied Friday night. 
 He got picked up at 9:30... D.U.I. 
 He spent the weekend in the drunk tank. 
 Ouch. 
 Thanks. 
 Keep an eye on Rosales for me. 
 Call me as soon as he's awake. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, babe. 
 Hi. What are you doing? 
 Watching MMA with Leon. 
 That's good. 
 As long as there's someone there to keep you warm, I won't feel so guilty about staying through the weekend. 
 Rick? 
 So much for "I'm gonna be on the next flight tomorrow," huh? 
 I'm under a lot of pressure. 
 Baby, I found the girl. 
 Oakes wants me to see it through. 
 Great. 
 We'll be there Sunday for the party. 
 I don't care what he does. 
 Good. 
 Because we're still getting married, right? 
 Of course. 
 And when you get married, there's lots of crap you got to do, like the cake, the flowers, the streamers... 
 Crap you said you cared about. 
 I do care. You know I care. 
 I'll make this up to you. I promise. 
 Just try to get on the plane next time. I got to go. 
 Leon's getting jealous. 
 I love you. 
 Hey. 
 Some leftover minestrone on the stove. 
 And you don't have to worry about waking him up. 
 Five hours of "Halo" knocked him on his butt. 
 Thanks, Regi. 
 How's that quitting smoking going? 
 It's fine. 
 He wanted to wait up, but I told him he had to go to school tomorrow. 
 He's not happy. 
 I could let him smoke cigarettes all day on the dock, but I thought school might be a little better. 
 That's what you were doing when you were his age. 
 A lot more than that. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I want a little more for Jack than that. 
 Sonoma will be a fresh start. He'll love it. 
 It'll be great. 
 I bet. 
 So, what's holding you back? 
 Nothing. 
 Work. 
 I thought work was over. 
 So did I. 
 I got to get back. 
 I'm just gonna take a little shower. 
 Okay. I got clean towels downstairs. 
 Thank you for letting us stay, Regi. 
 I got my two favorite people in the whole world for a couple more days. 
 That's not a bad deal. 
 Hi. I'm not here right now, and neither is anyone else, apparently, which is weird, because we usually are here. 
 But not today. 
 Um...I really don't know where we are. 
 Uh... Anyway, leave a message, and I promise that we will get back to you. 
 Bye. 
 Hi. I'm not here right now, and neither is anyone else, apparently, which is weird, because we usually are here. 
 But not today. 
 Um...I really don't know where we are. 
 Uh... Anyway, leave a message, and I promise that we will get back to you. 
 Bye. Great seeing you again. Yeah. You're really one that matters. Now, I'm having a little party. I'll phone you about it. Thank you very much for coming. If Cicero had bided his time, he would've gone far. Instead, the Romans executed him. Put his hands and head on display in the forum. You needed to see me, mayor? It's unfortunate, what happened with your campaign car and that girl, Darren. I'd say the race is pretty much over for you at this point, but all is not lost. Wait four years, you'll have my endorsement. Donors will flee you lose this time. No second chances. So you can get on your knees for four more years for the developers? I don't think so. No need to wallow, Darren. You didn't really think the police would keep this thing a secret from me, did you? Holder, I got the yearbook from principal Meyers. I'm on my way over. We had a deal. We did. Then what the hell is this? It didn't come from us. Who did it come from? I don't know. I played fair with you, detective. I know you did. I appreciate that. My campaign is in the gutter now because I trusted you. What can I do? Make an arrest. All right. That was the bell, people. I need you in your seats. Now. Now! People! That's it. Give me the damn phone. You people never cease to amaze me. By now, most of you have heard what happened to Rosie. Grief counselors will be in the gym all day for tho... Sterling. Sterling! I thought, um, we could take today's class period to talk about it. I know this may be a difficult time. Hey, Sterling! Sterling, get back here! I don't care what he says. All right? I'm not gonna do it right now. Give me some time to ease in. I mean, she's not stupid. Uh, hey, uh... I-I got to go, so I'll call you back. Thanks. Dr. Elson, please report to Cardiology. What's up? Dr. Elson... Cardiology. Hmm? What? N-nothing. With Rosales. Oh. Oh, yeah, um, he's out of surgery. He's conscious, but he's all doped up on morphine. And no visitors. She's a prison guard. She's got a crush on me. So, work your magic. Yo, Mary? Mary, right? Did I tell you about that time I got pica when I was like 5? You had to keep the play-doh locked up around me. But I guess you see a lot of that, right? Mr. Rosales? Can you hear me? I'm sorry this happened to you. We know why you ran, but that's not why I need to talk to you right now. I know that sometimes you watch the kids in the basement at school. That's not my concern. What I need to know is if you saw this girl, Rosie Larsen, in the basement Friday night. Helping us can help you, Mr. Rosales. You saw Rosie there? You're sure? Yes. Who was with her? In the basement? Was it this guy? Jasper Ames? You're sure? You can't be here. Seattle P.D. I don't know who let you in here, but you're gonna have to leave now. This patient is in critical condition. Look, you two can't be in here! Chill. We're... Don't tell me to chill. This is my ward. He was in the basement with Rosie? You're positive? Yeah. Mary! Yeah? Page Dr. Molnar and call security! Okay. Hey, relax, girlfriend. All right. We're leaving. You don't have to do that. What? El...Diablo. I want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to help the police solve the Larsen case. But for now... and, most importantly, for the people of Seattle... I think what we really need to do is take a deep breath and stay the course. You know? Every one of you in this room is helping to change lives with the work that you do here every day. So... Let's commit to winning this campaign, shall we? 
 
 Nice job. I spoke with the register,  and Michaud is willing to give you column space, but only if it's an exclusive. Sold. And I've got some interest in the all stars photo op this afternoon. We're gonna push your education agenda. Good. Good. Hey, we stay on message, and this is gonna blow over. All these reporters... they have A.D.D. Yeah. Where are you going? Nice view. Yeah. Never get tired of it. What do you have for me? Well, I checked Jamie and Gwen's accounts. No e-mails about the Larsen girl, but I did find this from a few days ago, leaking Yitanes' endorsement. Thank you, Nathan. Yeah. So, Kris Echols is a meth-dealing skater punk. He got kicked out of Fort Washington first week senior year. His mom reported him as a runaway. And get this. He's Jasper Ames' best friend. So, the janitor was the only one who saw the Echols kid at the dance? Anyone I.D. Jasper there? It doesn't make sense. What's Rosie doing with a dealer? Well, who you think's getting hooked on crank these days? Housewives and cheerleaders. Well, I could talk to the parents, see if they can shed some light. They've been calling all morning, pissed off about the Richmond thing. Oh, and you're gonna want to tell them cause of death, Sarah... They need to know. I-I can do that. Talk to the Larsens. Uh, no. I'll do it. You talk to Echols' family. Okay, boss. Wait a minute. Look at this. What? We went over this yesterday. Look at it again. Sterling, Rosie, and... That's how Kris got into the dance without anyone recognizing him. He wore a mask. "El Diablo." But here we are, folks... just days away from the birth of Seattle's waterfront renewal project! Groundbreaking on the mayor's $44.6 million dream project takes place tomorrow. This will allow more than $1 billion... I'm surprised he didn't throw in a jab about the Larsen girl. He didn't have to. The damage is done. Yitanes hasn't officially endorsed him yet. That's good news. The only thing he has is the waterfront, and he knows it. We stay on message, Darren. It's a waste of the taxpayers' dollars. It's lining his pockets and the CDF's coffers. He's stealing from programs like yours that really make a difference. Gwen, spare me the sound byte. I found our leak... Who went to the press about Yitanes. Why? I don't get it. He's always been loyal. This doesn't make sense. Yeah. Well... There you have it. He's playing both sides. Helping Adams. Hoping if you lose, he'll get an appointment. That's ridiculous. That's the only thing that makes sense, Darren. You know him. This is just a game to him. I trusted him. He doesn't care. He just wants to win. What are we gonna do? Hey. Ready to play some hoops? We got to be at the park at 5:00 for that press thing. Any luck with the Larsen family? They're not answering our calls. All right. Maybe we butter them up? Send them some roses? White roses. No. No flowers. Flowers die. She drowned? Rosie drowned? I thought you should know. We had to find out about that politician in the paper. I know. I'm sorry. That shouldn't have happened. Did he... Is he the one who did it? All that we know right now is that the campaign had a lot of cars. That particular one was reported stolen on Saturday morning. So, you haven't arrested anybody yet. We are working on it, Mr. Larsen. There's a couple of things that have come up that I need to ask you about. Did Rosie ever mention a Kris Echols to you? Well, he lived down the street. Him and Rosie used to play together when they were little. Why? Did Rosie keep in touch with him? No. It was a long time ago. He and his family moved away from the neighborhood like three years ago. He had problems... drugs, I think. What about Rosie? Did she ever drink or use drugs? No. Why are you asking that? We're throwing a wide net, looking at everybody that your daughter associated with. No particular reason. Well, he seemed like a good kid. Yeah. Did she suffer? We think that she was probably unconscious when the car went in, so...no. All right, Aman. You ready for your final beatdown? If I thought one was coming! Hup! Ohh! Ugh! Oh, yeah! 21... Oh, yeah! Nothin' but net, D.R.! You need to wrap it up, councilman. Next time, Aman. You won't know what hit you. All right, glad you guys got to see this in action. This all stars program is in 35 parks around the city and a key component to councilman Richmond's anti-gang initiative. Is it true councilwoman Yitanes has pulled her endorsement because of the Larsen murder? No comments? What about the car? Any news on who was driving the car the girl was found in? Uh, how would we know? The, uh, the car was stolen. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. We'll be in touch. Don't give them any more fodder, Darren. Let this thing burn itself out. That won't happen, Jamie. There's a leak in the campaign. Yeah. Someone tipped off the press about Yitanes' endorsement. And now this. The cops leaked this. They never keep their mouths shut. And Yitanes probably blabbed herself. Everybody's playing both sides now, Darren. It's the name of the game. Yeah? Hey, you stay focused. We've got 23 days to turn this thing around. We can do it. Hell, we're gonna do it. We always have, right? Kris started using drugs when he was 13. First it was pot, then...I don't know. The meth started when he was in high school. Well, where's your son now? Last time I did try to get him some help, I found him at marginal way. You know, that horrible place next to the bridge? I don't know what he did this time. And I don't want to know. Maybe you could remember that he has a mother that loves him and who prays for him every night. They all do. Yo, man. Can I get some of that? Nope. Man. Damn. Got a light? I'm looking for some shards. I heard Kris is the hook-up. You a cop? Do I look like a cop? Are you a cop? So, what's up? Is he here? No. Maybe later. Can I get some of that? He ain't here. Relax, mom. It's narc-scent. Smells like weed. Tastes like weed. It ain't weed. Used it on busts all the time. What did green hair say? No Rosie sightings, but she said Kris is a regular. So, he'll be here. Skatepark's walking distance to the campaign parking lot. He could've stolen that car Friday night. Hmm. Get cozy, Linden. We got a wait. Found a way to lure Yitanes back to our camp. Really? Her husband. The plumber? Plumbing contractor. Been a dead weight on her ass for years. Didn't that guy have his license revoked? No, just suspended. Paid a little fine. No biggie. So? So, remember the teen shelters Yitanes is sponsoring? They're gonna need toilets, right? She can't give her husband the job, but you can. So, I trade my rubber stamp for her endorsement? Oh, come on, Darren. Some plumber's gonna get the job anyway. Why shouldn't you benefit from it? It's interesting how you're so worried about our chances now. What are you talking about? Gwen... We saw the e-mail, Jamie. What e-mail? Okay, this is bullshit. I never wrote this. Obviously someone have hacked into my account. Don't I even get a chance to defend myself here? You just did. I don't believe this. You're letting s*x cloud your judgment. Jamie, enough. Screw you. Screw both of you. I thought I was gonna be back by dinner, but, um, I'm still working. You and Regi gonna do takeout? Great. Don't forget to tell her thanks. Hey, Jack, no soda. You'll be up all night. Chill, Linden. I mean, I never had dinner with my mom, and... Look at me. That's comforting. Kind of young to be out here alone. How old do you think she is? 14 going on 40, like the rest of 'em. Hey, check it out. Later, man. What's up, Kris? What the hell, man? Need to talk to you. Yeah? Well, I don't need to talk to you, 5-O. Yeah? We're taking you in. On what grounds, huh? I know my rights. You gonna arrest me? Didn't think so. We know you were at Fort Washington Friday night at the dance. Whatevs. I'm out. What'd you do to Rosie, Kris? I don't know what you're talking about. You gave her some bad sh1t. She O.D.'d down in that hellhole, and you freaked. Get off me! Let him go. I said let him go, Holder. Aah! Your mom says hi! Dickhead. Now what? Let's go. Why did you tell people I'm still considering endorsing you? Because I'm still hoping you will. Did I not make myself clear last night? You are the kind of liability I need like a kick in the ass. Maybe. But I have a proposition. Sit down, Ruth. No. I'll be out here if you need me. You may not need me... But I understand your husband might. What are you talking about? The multimillion-dollar teen shelter program you've sponsored. No, no. I don't need you to make that happen. No. But you need me to ensure that Yitanes and sons do all plumbing. Wow. How far the mighty have fallen. You're surprising me here, Darren. I need your sway with the unions to win this election. And your husband needs a job. You must think I'm pretty easy. Nothing's easy with you, Ruth. What's up, Kris? They know we were at the dance, huh?! You told them! I didn't tell them anything! Come on! What are you talking about?! They know. I don't get it. What's his damage with rich boy? Rosie wouldn't have gone down in that basement with Kris. What? She'd go with someone she trusted, like Jasper. Let's pick him up. With what? We've got nothing. Linden. Okay. We're on our way. Teacher found something. Denny? Turn off the TV and come help your brother. Hey. Hi, mom. Oh, babe, let me get that. I'll do that. No, we got it covered. Chocolate-chip pancakes, huh? Yep. Go on. Take a bath. Relax a little before we eat. Okay? I got it, babe. Sorry, dad. I...forgot. It's okay, Tom. It's okay. Hey, why don't you leave it? Rosie's teacher confiscated a phone from a student earlier today. Go ahead. Play it. They sent the video to a bunch of kids at the school. Yeah, you show her. You getting all this? You little bitch. You like this, don't you, Rosie, huh? Wait a second. Hold on. Here I come. Stop moving. Yeah, bitch. They did it together. Bring 'em in. ...Next mayor of our fine city, mayor Richmond! Thank you. But we are... we are truly...
