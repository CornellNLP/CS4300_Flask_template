 Previously on AMC's The Killing... 
 A son needs a father. 
 Next time you come near my son I'll have you arrested for kidnapping. 
 I've been wondering what made the police so certain I killed that girl. 
 Piotr Michaelski. 
 Is that the guy Stan whacked? 
 That's our tattoo boy. Alexi Giffords, AKA Giffs. 
 Do you have Alexi's file? 
 His father's listed as... 
 Piotr Michaelski. 
 You got what you deserved. 
 [ Elevator bell dings ] 
 [ Footsteps echoing ] 
 [ Heart beating ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Monitors beeping ] 
 Holder: Alexi Giffords-- nee Alexi Michaelski. 
 When he's 5, his pop gets whacked by mob soldier Stan Larsen. 
 Alexi gets dumped into foster care, grows up hating on Stan Larsen, biding his time, and then he moves in three blocks from him. 
 And meets Rosie, changes plans. 
 Why kill dad when you can kill what's most precious to him? 
 Taunting him, drop off his dead kid's bloody backpack. 
 Poetic justice. 
 [ Doorknob rattles ] 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 [ Yawns ] 
 Hope I ain't interrupting. I got the large black. 
 Holder has the creamer, seven sugars. 
 What are you two doing in there? 
 Thanks, Duncan. Keep the change. 
 [ Laughs ] Keep that up. 
 They're gonna say you broke up with Sonoma 'cause of me. 
 Yo, wouldn't be the first time. You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Maybe Alexi's mom knows where he's holed up. 
 Let's have a chat. 
 He could be halfway to Alaska by now. 
 It's 1:00 AM. 
 [ Cellphone ringing ] 
 [ Cellphone beeps ] Hey, Jack. 
 You okay? You don't sound so good. 
 Well, uh, check the green suitcase. 
 It's where I packed all the cold and flu stuff in there. 
 Echinacea and myrrh, son. That's the ticket. 
 Straight-up anti-oxidels. 
 Okay. Well, I'll pick you up some Tylenol. 
 [ Paper rustles ] 
 Soon. I'm still at work. 
 Are you sure you're okay? 
 All right. Try to get some sleep. 
 I'll be there as soon as I can. 
 Bye. 
 It's cool, Linden. 
 Take care of the little man. I got it. 
 No, let's go. 
 I'll get Tylenol on the way there. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 Ain't exactly the highlight of my life giving up my kid, okay? 
 So, the last time you saw him was when you dropped him off at that church. 
 Gave him up when he was 4. 
 I mean, he's never gonna forget his new foster dad. 
 He's touching him at night. 
 You are a cruel man. 
 Well, I'm not the one who left my son behind! 
 Holder? 
 I have a son, too. 
 And I worry, too, about the ways I've let him down. 
 The times I wasn't there for him. 
 I know what it feels like to... 
 To think you've failed your child. 
 But he came back to you, didn't he? 
 That's when you gave him that photo of him and his father when he was little. 
 So he'd know he was loved. 
 I know he's here, Monica. 
 He's a good boy. 
 [ Cellphone beeps ] He's got nothing to do with what happened to that Larsen girl. 
 Holder: This is Detective Holder. Badge number 4592. 
 Request backup to 2212 Carlyle street. 
 [ Cellphone closes ] 
 It's better if I take him in than if they find him. 
 [ Stairs creaking ] 
 [ Thud ] 
 Okay. 
 Mitch:  Hey. You've reached Mitch. 
 Please leave a message after the beep. 
 Thanks. [  Beep  ] Hey. It's me. I'm just calling to see how you're doing. I hope okay. W-we're  okay. Well... [ Chuckling ] 
...Most of the time. The boys... [ Sighs ] Well, they miss you, babe. [ Bottle thuds ] I  miss you. Um... [ Sighs ] [ Voice breaking ] 
The things I've done. They just won't let me go, you know, and I'm... [ Telephone beeps ] [ Sighing ] [ Exhales deeply ] [  "Flood And Fire" plays in background ] ♪ day after day ♪ ♪ you know it ain't right ♪ 
♪ slow as a glass, you're slipping away ♪ 
♪ you're flood and fire ♪ [ Sighs ] ♪ You're flood and fire ♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Remote clicks ] Man:  This autumn canvas... Man #2:  'Cause I've got this show in October, so... [  Gunshot  ] [  Dramatic music plays  ] [ Remote clicks, music stops ] [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Elevator bell dings ] Excuse me. Sorry. Hey. Man: 4, please. [ Door opens, closes ] Rise and shine, princess. What, you want room service? Eggs over easy? Buttered toast? [  Slams table  ] Get up! [  Exhales slowly  ] I want a soda. You don't get a soda. You don't get sh1t. Hell, you don't get to sit on that chair. Get up. Get up. [ Chair scrapes ] [ Sighs ] [ Chair clatters ] [ Door slams ] You and me... ...we're gonna have a little convo about your girlfriend, Rosie. [ Police radio chatter ] Seems like you didn't watch the tattoo one too many times, the way   you be drawing Rosie... Half a dozen unis, photo team, overtime and a half. He better be our doer, Linden. [ Paper rustles ] It's preliminary lab work... Back on Alexi's place-- 
Rosie's prints turned up. And I've got his prints on her backpack and the super 8 camera. Don't worry, son. The lab also have turned up traces of ammonium hydroxide on the straps of the bag. It's the same chemical that was found under Rosie's fingernails. [ Paper rustles ] You got eight hours with him. Why? He hasn't asked for a lawyer. We can hold him for 24. Not if he's been here overnight. This department's under the microscope. No small part of that  your  doing. We do everything by the book. You got eight-- 
Then charge him or let him go. [ Footsteps depart ] [ Door opens, closes ] [ Cellphone chimes ] [ Cellphone closes ] [ Sighs ] Tina: I told you. [ Indistinct conversation in distance ] Man: This is unbelievable. Where's the money? What did you do with it, then? I don't have any money. How am I supposed to pay for this, then, huh? Fine. [ Gasps ] Are you serious? Uh-huh. God! Jerk! [ Chuckles ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Polish accent ] 
How could she leave the boys? I don't understand. Tommy and Denny cannot stay here no more. - Helen. The boys are doing just fine. They're staying exactly where they are. Look at this place. I'm working on it. It's been crazy. You're doing a  lot for us, Terry. And it's appreciated. [ Polish accent ] We're just concerned about you, Stan. You need support and help. I know what's best for my boys. Being in their own home is what they need right now. Helen: Why did she leave you? Ma. No, you let him talk. I want to know. I got to take care of something down at the station. Is everything okay? Something I should have done a while ago. [ Sighs ] Always good seeing you, tad. Oh, that's it, Stan. Go on, walk out. [ Sighs ] Hi, um... I need a Coke, big scrambler with pancakes, and a number 11. You got enough to cover that? See that sign? It says I have the right to refuse service to anyone. [ Scoffs ] What did I do? I mean, what the hell? I got it. I-I'll pay for her. Yeah. She's gonna pay for me. You can come sit if you want. Okay. [ Sighs ] So, what? There some guy waiting in your room? I mean, it's cool, whatever, but I got to eat first. I... Oh-- oh. 
[ Chuckling ] No. No, it's nothing like that. No. Your husband in the room, huh? I'm not married. Did he... beat you or what? [ Inhales sharply ] [ Sighs ] No. He's a good man. [ Chuckles ] Listen, I... I saw you earlier down by the pool. You were with your boyfriend... That a-hole? 
[ Scoffs ] Okay, look. FYI-- That's  not  my boyfriend. Okay? He's just, like, some guy who had beer or whatever. Hey, do you want to buy a postcard from here? They only cost 50 cents, and they make great gifts. Kids love them. Here. Do you have kids? What are you, like 17, 18? Yeah. 
[ Scoffs ] [ Breathes deeply ] [ Sniffs ] Child protective services. Larkspur, Burien... King County Juvenile Detention. You get around, Alexi. [ Scoffs ] The worst food's at County. Those bologna sandwiches. The forever cheese. [ Breathes deeply ] Case number 78-203. It's funny how it never leaves you like a nickname. So now Slim Shady's gone, what are you? Good cop? I'm not gonna lie to you, Alexi. You know the drill, but... If you care, I get it. Okay? What he did to your dad-- 
Stan Larsen-- He had it coming. He took away the one person who could protect you. Left you with that emotional cripple-- Your mother. She gave you up, Alexi. And the second time, it wasn't that hard for her. There's no way she had your back. Ever. My mom, too. Cops must have come five or six times. I'd try to cover it up. Knew the foster house was gonna be worse, and it was, right? Kids aren't fools. We know. I must have run away half a dozen times, but in the end, she gave me up. That's what they do. It wasn't fair. Rosie had everything. She had a family who loved her. A dad who loved her, and she loved him, too. [ Laughs ] No, she didn't. Rosie hated her parents. What do you mean? Whatever. I'm done talkin'. Barbie. Did you tell her what Stan did to your father? No. Then why'd she hate her family? You gonna charge me? If you think you have something on me, then charge me, because otherwise... Another two hours, and I walk. Give me a cigarette. Please. Kid's lying. Rosie had secrets. Sterling said as much. Bank account, Beau Soleil, burner phone she used the night she died. All of this six months before she was killed. Something changed in that time. Maybe Alexi told her about Stan's past. Made her turn on him. Mitch wasn't a part of it. Why did Rosie hate her, too? It doesn't add up. Where's his phone? Processing, along with his other stuff. Why? If she called him or texted him, we could do a reverse look-up on the burner phone. They rode bikes in the park together. She had to call him at least once. Want to get a warrant? No. Ray can do a download without it. Won't be able to use it in court. If we get a confession, we won't need to. Come on, Linden. Carlson's looking for any reason to sink the case. Why's Carlson gonna find out? Just keep your mouth shut. We'll be fine. [ Door opens ] [ Police radio chatter ] Mr. Larsen. Stan: I got to talk to you. Uh, come with me to my office. You asked me before about my past, if it had anything to do with-- with... What happened to Rosie. I want to give you some names. Some people who have ideas about me-- about things I did. May-- may I-- we're taking care of this, Mr. Larsen. You need to leave. That's Michaelski's boy. We've got this. It's better if you go now. Please. Mr. Larsen. Please. I'm going. Linden. [ Breathes deeply ] Mind if I smoke? Uh... no, no. I  don't  mind. [ Lighter clicks ] You visiting someone? Those things will kill ya. Kind of a family tradition. My brother's here for chemo. I know-- I should probably quit one day, right? I'm sure your brother... appreciates you being here. Well, tell that to  him. It's nothing to be here. To show up. We're all here. The whole family. That's what you do, right? You show up. Do you, um... want me to get you someone? I, uh... can do that. No. Ray: I got into Alexi's voicemail. Rosie called him twice on October 5th. Second time, she left a message. 1:14 AM, check it out. [ Click ] [  Machinery humming  ] What's that? I don't know. Maybe some kind of generator. Can you play it again? Yeah. [ Click ] [  Thud  ] That sounds like a sliding door. It could be from inside the casino. Hotel? Mm-hmm. I'll look into it. Here it comes. Rosie:  Oh, my God, Alexi, where are you? [  Panting  ] I'm not even supposed to be here. I saw him again. Lex, I am in so much trouble if anybody finds out I'm here. Please... please call me the second you get this. I can't talk anymore. God, please, Lex, help me! Please... please call me the second you get this. [ Click ] Sarah: Rosie was scared and alone. And she turned to you. She trusted you. You didn't put her in that lake, Alexi. "I saw him again." Who was she talking about? 
 
 [ Click ] I'm not even supposed to be here, Lex. I saw him again. [ Click ] Rosie called you earlier that night. Same call, same time, every Friday night, from her to you. You know what I think? I think you didn't want her to walk alone to the ferry at nights. She went to the casino every Friday night, and you drove her to the ferry, didn't you? You wanted to hate her, but you couldn't? We know Rosie was in your apartment. Her prints were there. Then you left her there alone... scared, trapped, you piece of sh1t. You let her die! No, I called her back! What happened? She... She didn't pick up. So, what? You took off? Figured it wasn't your problem? No. I waited at the dock all night, and she never came back. Why'd you drop her backpack off? I didn't, okay?! It wasn't me who did that! Who was she scared of, Alexi? Who'd she mean by "him"? 
"I saw him again." I don't know. She must have told you. Think. [ Sighing ] We were waiting in the drop-off lane at the ferry that night. She was laughing. She got down in the seat like she didn't want to be seen, but it wasn't like she was scared or nothing. What made her duck down? Come on, Alexi. It had to be something. We will protect you. Whoever it was. She was alone and scared, and she called you. She trusted that you would be there for her. Be there now. [ Door opens ] Let's go, Linden. Time's up. No! Not yet! Come on. His lawyer's here. His mom put in a call. You didn't call the police when you got her message because they let you down so many times when your father was killed. You had nobody. All Rosie has is you. Don't let her down. Who was she scared of, Alexi? Tell me. Moss: Lieutenant, I'd like to talk to my client. Now. If you'll excuse us. [ Sighs ] [ Door closes ] [ Horn honks ] [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Engine turns over ] Janek's place. Great. They're gonna be holing him up here for a while. Deprogramming him. Thanks for stopping by, mom. What is it, papa? Y-you living here with Stan-- Don't you see it don't look right? That's why we're worried, me and your ma. I'm helping him with the boys. So what happened to that guy, the big shot you were seeing? Hmm? You still waiting for him to come around? I don't want to talk about him. He's not coming. Like the other guy. I wish things were different for you, sweetheart. I wish... I-I wish you weren't alone. I'm not alone, papa. Helen: [ Speaks Polish ] [ Door closes ] [  "Gloria"  plays ] 
♪ was it something that they said? ♪ [ Laughs ] ♪ all the voices in your head ♪ 
♪ they're calling Glori-a-a-a ♪ [ Laughing ] ♪ Gloria ♪ That was wonderful! That was excellent! Well, yeah. I have never even taken a voice lesson, if you can believe it. [ Both laugh ] So, how old is your kid? Your age. So you skipped out on her and the hubsters? That's cold. She left. My daughter left. So, what, you're, like, on some mission to find her or something lame like that? Look, I'm not a rat. So if that's what you're expecting, I mean, I'm not gonna help you. Why did you leave? Waitress: You ladies want anything else? Um... no. I'm gonna puke if I eat anything else. [ Chuckles ] 
No, just the check. [ Paper rustles ] Hey. I'm staying at the motel, too, and I'm-- I'm just above the pool, and I'm in room 214. If you need anything. And I'm probably gonna be back here for dinner. [ Chuckling ] I guess. My boyfriend's probably back by now, so... I'll see ya. Okay. Hi. Hi. Hey. [ Chuckles ] You look great, Eve. Thanks. Sit down. I don't have much time. It's the usual-- two sweet'n lows. I wasn't sure you'd come. What, are you kidding? After so many years of radio silence? Why would I miss this? How's Kurt? You really want to know? No. Then let's not do that. DA's office suits you. I love it. It's a lot more satisfying than politics. I actually really make a difference. I'm re you do. Are you still married to your job, Jamie? Let's talk about you. Your work. DA's office still taking heat for dropping charges against Darren? What do you want, Jamie? You don't have a fever anymore? Good. That's great. Uh, I'll be home soon. Just as soon as I can. Okay. [ Cellphone closes ] [ Rattling ] [ Lid closes ] [ Plastic rustles ] You want a smoke? Mnh-mnh. You sure you don't want a cigarette? Holder. It's just a matter of time before you're back in the fold. You know, Linden, you should live a little. Smoking isn't how I define living. All right. Just don't go all "falling down" on me 'cause you can't get your fix. So, how's little man? He's better. He's probably just trying to dodge school. He has an algebra quiz tomorrow. You should tell him to call me. Since I  aced  algebra last time. All right. [ Sighs ] What are you doing? Hmm? I'm gonna call the station. Have the unis send over a car. You go check up on Jack. I got this. I'll make sure Alexi doesn't leave town. Don't worry about me. I never do. 
[ Chuckles ] Thank you. [ Car door closes ] [ Door locks ] Jack. [ Gasps ] What are you doing here? He had 103 fever when I got here. Where were you? You have to go. You got nothing here, not even a thermometer. What the hell is going on, Sarah? Maybe you didn't know where to look because you don't live here! I do. I  live  here with my son. You call this living? Look. I don't want to fight with you, but Jack's been calling me. He's scared, confused... You had a lawyer call me and threaten me! All I want is to be a part of his life, okay? It's time. [ Dialing ] What are you doing? This is Detective Sarah Linden. I need a unit at 392 McCarl Avenue. Jesus, Sarah-- I told you if you ever came near my son I'd have you arrested. I'm going. Okay? I'm leaving. Cancel it. No. C-cancel it. You care more about that dead girl than you do about your own son. [ Door opens, closes ] Alexi: Don't turn around. Just drive. [ Engine turns over ] Hey, you won't believe what I found out. You, uh-- you want-- you want me to get the nurse? [ Sobbing ] No. I don't want a nurse. [ Sobs ] Not like this. [ Sobbing ] You want the bed up or down? [ Curtain scrapes ] I knew this guy, worked at the Boeing plant for 35 years. One of those guys. Decorated vet. I don't want to hear it, Jamie. I'm talking about my grandfather. Ted. I was in the third grade when the accident at the plant happened. I watched him lose everything. His wife, house... his job. He was dying. Right there in front of me... until he started to fight back. He fought like the son of a bitch he was. And he got it all back, Darren. Used to always say, bad luck either destroys you... or it makes you the man you really are. I'm not the man your grandpa Ted was. How about this? The man you're conceding the race to-- He's the same prick who put you in that chair. Adam framed you. I can't prove it yet, but I got a friend at the DA's office. There's a tollbooth photo of you the night Rosie Larsen was murdered. Put you right where they needed you. It was a fake. So... Still want to throw in the towel? I'm gonna destroy him. [ Papers rustle ] [ Papers thud ] [ Glass shatters ] [ Thud ] Who's there?! [ Locks turns ] [ Knock on door ] [ Knock on door ] Holder: Linden. [ Lock turns ] Holder, what are you doing? Got Alexi in the car. He wants to talk. Okay. Drake: The good news is the teacher's gonna make it. Attempted murder charge has been dropped. Now, you're still looking at kidnapping and aggravated assault, Mr. Larsen. And, uh, I'm not gonna be able to plead this. We're goa have to go to trial. I thought you said there'd be... Compassion? I'm sure hoping for it. Due to your, um-- 
Your circumstances. These charges-- 
They're serious. Probably looking at a year before this thing goes to trial. [ Sighs ] What about my boys? My business? I just can't-- I figure you're looking at three to five years. I'm sorry. I wish I had better news for you. [ Sighs ] Alexi: I was gonna kill Stan Larsen. I followed him everywhere. Learned his routine, watched him day and night. And then you met Rosie? [ Sighs ] Who was she afraid of at that ferry? I-I think it was another car. Like in the next lane. Drop-off lane. Well, what kind of make? What color? [ Sighs ] It's black. Town car. I'm not sure it was a Cadillac-- Some kind of... Some kind of luxury make. A rich guy. Who was inside of it? I couldn't see. The windows were tinted. [ Scoffs ] [ Door opens ] [ Door closes ]

I never knew a girl that had so many secrets. Really? She wouldn't even tell me what she was doing at the casino. Or how she found out about her dad. Found out what? What, uh, he did to your father? No, I told you-- 
She didn't know about that. It's just you and me, Alexi. You can tell me. What did Rosie find out? Hi. It's okay. What did Rosie find out? Alexi, what did she find out? The truth. Stan Larsen wasn't her real father.
