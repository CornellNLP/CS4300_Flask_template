 Wotcher. 
  All I wanted to do was disappear, and leave you in peace. 
  But George Cornelius put paid to that, and that's why I'm back to rap his knuckles. 
  I can handle George Cornelius. 
  No, you can't, John. 
  Go home, Lee. 
  Witness hasn't a clue as to what happened. 
  The victim's an ex-pupil. 
  Lee Peck. 
  The killer chased him from Ballarat Street. 
  Vivien Lake. 
  You're being too reckless. 
  I'm sorry. 
  - Hello, I'm Jeremy. 
  - [PENNY STRUGGLES] 
  I think she cleans up for him and she hates him for it. 
  My wife is very jealous. 
  If she finds out, she will strangle you. 
  [MUFFLED SCREAMING] 
  So, does that mean Vivien doesn't know about Penny Leyton? 
  Go! 
  Where is Jeremy?! 
  Where is he? 
  Now, I don't know what's going on between you and Luther, but you need to stay away from my officer. 
  - Yes? 
  - CORNELIUS: Mr. 
  Palmer? 
  Is it convenient to talk? 
  Leave him be. 
  - None of this is his fault. 
  - Benny? 
  6'1", brown eyes, muscular  
  [GASPS] 
  Here. 
  Now. 
  No more chat. 
  All right, I'm coming, I'm coming! 
  I'm going to send you to a series of checkpoints. 
  You won't know the final destination until you arrive. 
  Mark isn't a part of this. 
  I need to know that he's walking away. 
  PALMER: [ON PHONE] 
  Do as I say, he gets to go home and watch The One Show. 
  JOHN: [ON PHONE] 
  And Alice? 
  Sorry. 
  You know how it is. 
  I still need to know he's all right, I need proof. 
  You have my word. 
  I said I need proof. 
  PALMER: Stay by your phone.

  - Excuse me. 
  And the kitchen rope. 
  No, no, I got Braeburns instead. 
  - Sorry, excuse me. 
  - About 10 minutes. 
  Yeah. 
  Love you. 
  Yes. 
  Yeah. 
  Love you. 
  - Sorry, excuse me? 
  - MAN: Bye. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  Er, I'm afraid you dropped this. 
  That's so kind, thank you. 
  [STAMMERS] 
  No worries. 
  Happy to help.

  Love is like a sin, my love For the ones that feel it the most Look at her with her eyes like a flame She will love you like a fly Will never love you again Stay away from the door, he said. 
  [ALICE SIGHING] 
  He's not here, is he? 
  He's out there. 
  Preparing to kill John. 
  - [ALICE GRUNTS] 
  - [LOUD THUD] 
  And then you. 
  And then me. 
  [LOCK RATTLING] 
  If that's what he wants, why hasn't he done it already? 
  [DOORKNOB RATTLES] 
  ALICE: John wouldn't come here without proof of life. 
  Well, your life anyway. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Mine, not so much. 
  - [THUDS] 
  - [ALICE GROANS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  You make a good bag lady. 
  Thank you.

  Guv, where are you? 
  So it turns out Jeremy Lake was keeping, I don't know Er, I don't know what to call it,  
  - a scrapbook? 
  - Look, Catherine, I need some help. 
  What sort of help? 
  I just need you to find someone for me, all right? 
  His name's, er, Ronald Massey. 
  He works for a man I need to find. 
  Erm, Guv, I can't just I mean, who is he? 
  JOHN: [ON PHONE] 
  Look, Catherine, I'll be there as soon as I can. 
  I'll bring in Jeremy Lake but I need you to do this first, okay? 
  Can you just do it? 
  - Boss, I  
  - JOHN: Catherine, do it. 
  [CAR HORN HONKING] 
  [ENGINE REVVING] 
  HALLIDAY: Massey. 
  Let's see. 
  Ronald Massey.

  - [BLEEPS] 
  - HALLIDAY: The mask's of Lake's own face, which is new behaviour, as far as we know. 
  But it is consistent with some of the images in the diary. 
  SCHENK: His condition disinhibiting him? 
  Yeah, or maybe he knows we're breathing down his neck and he's decided to go all carpe diem on us. 
  Do we have the faintest notion where DCI Luther is? 
  Sorry, boss. 
  Catherine, do you know anything I don't know? 
  Sorry, boss, no. 
  Vivien Lake knows her husband's mind. 
  She's the only one who can help us get ahead on this. 
  Let's bring her in. 
  Well, she's being treated at the hospital. 
  I don't care. 
  Wheel her in in a gurney if needs be. 
  Hey, Guv, I don't know what your other thing is but the big boss he's on his last nerve and I I don't feel comfortable lying for you. 
  And things are really kicking off here. 
  We need you. 
  [MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY] 
  Hello, I'm inquiring about the availability of Illeana. 
  This evening. 
  Overnight, for preference. 
  Ah, good. 
  Thank you. 
  [DOG BARKING] 
  Yes, hello, King of Plumbers, I have a dreadful smell coming from my drains. 
  Thank you. 
  SCHENK: Dr. 
  Lake, would you follow me, please? 
  [FIRE ALARM RINGING] 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] 
  That's right, quickly now. 
  Boss, we should probably go. 
  Nah, sod it. 
  It's just a drill. 
  Well, they usually say when it's a drill. 
  We'll go when the hair on your bollocks starts to sizzle. 
  I just Let me go and check. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  [FIRE ALARM CONTINUES RINGING] 
  [GUN COCKS] 
  [GRUNTS] 
  [GROANS] 
  [GROANS] 
  Call him off. 
  [MOBILE RINGING AND BUZZING] 
  We're on schedule. 
  [ON PHONE] 
  Luther should be here soon. 
  Er, yeah, I actually need you to hold off on that for a bit. 
  Why? 
  CORNELIUS: Because that's what I want. 
  We entered into a contract. 
  Er, you you'll get your money, just, erm, tell me where they are and then, er, take the rest of the day off. 
  - Go to the pictures or something. 
  - Come on. 
  Come on. 
  It's not that easy. 
  A police officer is dead. 
  I can't have that coming back on me. 
  Ah, it it won't come back on you. 
  Just text me the address and then pack your sandwiches and go home. 
  I'll make sure everything's tied off. 
  He says a copper's dead. 
  Yeah. 
  - That would be your mate. 
  - Yes. 
  Well, for what it's worth, I didn't ask for that. 
  Didn't you? 
  Your mate chucked it in for free, didn't he? 
  So where does that leave us? 
  [GUN COCKING] 
  I came to off you for Benny. 
  [SWALLOWS NERVOUSLY] 
  - I'm going to end this. 
  - [EXHALES] 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  JOHN: All this eye for an eye bullshit, it's all just a game, isn't it, George? 
  You don't want this. 
  You don't want any of it. 
  Do you? 
  You lost your discipline, George. 
  You robbed Alice, she robbed you back, now Alice is dead. 
  That's not her fault, that's your fault. 
  Benny's dead. 
  That's not your fault, that's my fault. 
  I couldn't shoot you in the head because I made a mistake. 
  But if you can shoot me then go ahead and do it. 
  It doesn't change anything, does it, George? 
  What I lost was my son. 
  [EXHALES IN FRUSTRATION] 
  [MUMBLES] 
  George. 
  Take it. 
  Eye for an eye. 
  [GUN COCKS] 
  You think I won't do this and piss on your body after? 
  Go on, George. 
  Just do it. 
  Just do it. 
  Go on. 
  PALMER: Stop there. 
  Do you have a gun? 
  Oh, er So, where is Luther? 
  He's in the boot. 
  Dead? 
  As a dodo's granddad. 
  How did you find him? 
  He came to me, as it happens. 
  And how did he find you? 
  I'm not entirely sure, to be frank. 
  But there you are. 
  He was a clever old sausage, but not bulletproof, as it turns out. 
  - Open the boot. 
  - CORNELIUS: Oh, come on. 
  Now. 
  If you would Open the boot. 
  All right, all right. 
  As you speak, so shall it be. 
  [KEY JINGLING] 
  [BOOT UNLOCKS] 
  Oi! 
  [GUN COCKS] 
  [GUN COCKS] 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  PALMER: I don't get it. 
  Peace In Our Time. 
  I'm Adolf, he's Neville, you're the Sudetenland. 
  JOHN: You're going to go down. 
  You're going to go to prison for killing my friend. 
  Do you understand that? 
  And if I don't agree? 
  I shoot you dead right now and tell a story to my boss. 
  - No! 
  - [GROANS] 
  [PALMER GROANS] 
  What did I tell you? 
  You're going to jail. 
  - And you're going to hate  
  - [GUNSHOT] 
  CORNELIUS: Sorry, old bean. 
  Couldn't take the risk. 
  - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] 
  - Here we are. 
  You, smoking gun, damning evidence and whatnot. 
  All in the cloud. 
  Whatever that actually is. 
  Hand over the gun. 
  I think it's one of mine, anyway. 
  You're a clever one, ain't you, George? 
  You would have been a good copper. 
  CORNELIUS: No. 
  Too honest to have been a copper. 
  Schenk came to me, John. 
  [SNIFFLES] 
  He knows something's not right between me and you. 
  I'll settle this with Schenk. 
  He trusts me. 
  Yeah, so do I. 
  But only because I got this. 
  Alice? 
  [METAL CLANGS] 
  [DOOR CREAKING] 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  Alice? 
  Oh, sh1t. 
  [SIGHS] 
  sh1t. 
  MARK: Is your friend in there? 
  - JOHN: Yeah. 
  - MARK: Aren't you gonna call someone? 
  I'll find him. 
  Well, we can't just leave him here. 
  JOHN: We have to. 
  For God's sake, he's your friend! 
  Got himself killed trying to protect us. 
  Do you think I want to be doing this, Mark? 
  Do you think I want to be doing this? 
  [ALICE BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  Benny's dead. 
  The man who killed him is dead. 
  What I'm trying to do is handle it so that your name is clear. 
  What time does your wife get back? 
  Half-seven, quarter past? 
  I think we need to get back and clean the scene. 
  What's happened to you, John? 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  [CAR DOOR CLOSES] 
  ALICE: What about the George Cornelius problem? 
  Have you dealt with it? 
  Yeah. 
  Let's not be coy. 
  Is he dead, John? 
  Yeah. 
  Because it's the only way. 
  He'll kill us both. 
  You do know that? 
  Alice, it's done. 
  You wouldn't lie to me, would you, John? 
  Not about something this important. 
  No. 
  Because you're the only person I ever knew who always told me the truth. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Come what may. 
  You never lie to me. 
  It's done. 
  [MOBILE CHIMES AND BUZZES] 
  That'll be your fancy lady calling you in for tea. 
  Oh, why don't you just give it a rest. 
  I've got to deal with this thing. 
  Deal with it, then. 
  Just go home and we'll talk later. 
  Good luck with your whatnot. 
  [ENGINE TURNS OVER] 
  [ENGINE REVS] 
  [TELEPHONE RINGING] 
  [LINE CONNECTING] 
  CORNELIUS: [ON PHONE] 
  Hello? 
  Hello, who is this? 
  Hello  
  [JOHN CLEARS HIS THROAT] 
  I hope you're not too uncomfortable. 
  A young woman just stabbed me, of course I'm uncomfortable. 
  I'm afraid that a number of doctors have certified you fit to be questioned. 
  And if there's one thing we can all agree on is, well, you can always trust a doctor. 
  Right? 
  SCHENK: We know your husband is gravely ill, Vivien. 
  Jeremy doesn't have long. 
  One more Christmas, perhaps. 
  But he'll never see another summer. 
  Now, if we can find and detain him, his case will never get to court. 
  He'll never go to prison. 
  The worst he can expect is a few months in a secure hospital. 
  But he will stop. 
  This will stop. 
  This will stop. 
  And this. 
  It will stop. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I have no idea about Jeremy's activities. 
  I'm as horrified as you. 
  Oh, I doubt if you have the capacity. 
  And to be fair, we did catch you in a plastic-lined room getting ready to disarticulate Penny Leyton with surgical tools. 
  I'm afraid you've misinterpreted that situation. 
  Actually, I was there to rescue her. 
  Get her out of there. 
  Poor thing. 
  But you were wearing surgical scrubs and were attacking her with a hammer. 
  I was defending myself from a very confused and frightened young woman. 
  Who understandably, given her state of delirium, misread the situation  
  - and believed, incorrectly  
  - [MOBILE CHIMES] 
  that I was there to do her ill. 
  SCHENK: I have to make a call. 
  We've had some urgent news. 
  Let's hope it's the news we all want, eh? 
  DS Halliday, if you would hold the fort, please? 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Where have you been? 
  [SIGHS] 
  I got called away, erm, to something that didn't pan out, boss. 
  Any news from Benny? 
  No. 
  No, he called in sick. 
  I've been called away. 
  I want you in there with Vivien Lake. 
  On my way. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [LINE CONNECTING] 
  MARTIN: [ON PHONE] 
  What do I need to know? 
  Sir, we were investigating reported gunshots. 
  You might wanna get somewhere private. 
  SCHENK: I am somewhere private. 
  Go ahead. 
  We found a disposable phone in the glovebox. 
  Call reports? 
  Most likely any calls were made to another burner. 
  SCHENK: Fine. 
  So I will need you to determine where that phone was last used. 
  See if you can find any CCTV footage corresponding with the time and place of that usage. 
  Absolutely. 
  You have all the resources you need, but none of the time. 
  I want this now. 
  End this. 
  Stays schtum. 
  Are we clear? 
  Nobody says a word. 
  Okay. 
  Sorry, I'm late. 
  I had a very busy day. 
  So, where did you meet, you and Jeremy? 
  Is that relevant? 
  I don't know. 
  We struck up a conversation at a dinner party talking about Tony Blair over baked Brie and raspberry jam. 
  That's not true. 
  You met at a play party, basically a fetish club. 
  You really are a bourgeois little prince, aren't you? 
  Thought police. 
  s*x police. 
  Erecting an edifice of speculation, a foundation for puritanical distaste. 
  No, that's not what I'm doing. 
  I'm basically trying to establish whether you would lie to protect your privacy, and the answer turns out to be "yes", which I find very interesting. 
  Did you know that Jeremy kept a diary? 
  Bit of a leap to conclude that's a diary, isn't it? 
  It looks more like a sketchbook to me. 
  Okay, what about these? 
  [PAGES FLIPPING] 
  These are actual drawings of murder scenes which makes me think about these other sketches too, which are, well, I don't know, I mean, are these real too? 
  Clearly not. 
  It's an explication of Jeremy's fantasy life. 
  An outlet. 
  A masturbatory aid, nothing more. 
  Yeah, possibly, it could be. 
  But it's not just the drawings, is it? 
  I mean it's the the text. 
  Well, that'll be, erm, cipher text of Jeremy's own construction. 
  Well, God knows what it says. 
  Do you think you could decipher it for us? 
  Well, I'd love to. 
  But I very much doubt I'd be able. 
  You have to get rid of this stuff properly. 
  No throwing it away in your own bin. 
  Oh, thank heavens I'm here with a criminal mastermind. 
  Otherwise whatever would I have done. 
  I have to go, Mark. 
  I promise you won't see me again. 
  Well, that'll be a shame. 
  [SNICKERS] 
  Some valedictory advice. 
  Don't let John Luther back through your door. 
  Not under any circumstance or for any reason. 
  He's not what you think he is. 
  Alice, you have to stop. 
  Oh, God knows you are what you are, but you're not a psychopath! 
  You're You're not without conscience. 
  You cannot live like this! 
  I know. 
  Do you need help? 
  - Is there something I  
  - [DOOR OPENS] 
  - [DOOR CLOSES] 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  Hello? 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  I had a boss, once. 
  Her name was Rose Teller. 
  Really good cop. 
  She used to say, erm, an assumption is something you don't know you're making. 
  Do you know the assumption you're making, Vivien? 
  Oh, I might be able to help answer that. 
  You're assuming that Jeremy doesn't want people to read what he's written. 
  Then why employ a cipher text in the first place? 
  Because he doesn't want you to know what he's written. 
  He doesn't want you to know that he's written it all down. 
  Everything that you've done, together. 
  Dates. 
  Times. 
  Places. 
  JOHN: Because that's the difference between you and him, isn't it? 
  I mean, you are very private, don't want anyone to know the truth about you, not ever. 
  And he is very proud of what he's done. 
  He's done with being anonymous. 
  He's done with someone else taking the credit. 
  This isn't a diary, it's a confession, isn't it? 
  And where does that leave you? 
  - I don't know  
  - Yes, you do! 
  You do, Vivien, don't you? 
  You know exactly where that leaves you if Jeremy has implicated you as an accessory to murder. 
  You know exactly what that means. 
  Well, obviously he wouldn't do that. 
  Are you willing to bet the rest of your life on that? 
  JOHN: No, of course you're not. 
  Because he has been letting you down recently, hasn't he? 
  Come on, Vivien. 
  Help us and we can help you. 
  You are going to prison, Vivien, but for how long is really up to you. 
  Can I have a glass of water, please? 
  No, you may not. 
  Jeremy's most outrÃ© fantasy, and I have to stress, to the best of my knowledge, it was just a fantasy, was to play a game of what he called "Happy Families". 
  To sit in a house and summon people to him. 
  Have them turn up at the door. 
  Lambs to the slaughter. 
  [DOORBELL RINGING] 
  [WOMAN GROANS] 
  Sir. 
  The phone was used here. 
  He arrives alone. 
  SCHENK: George Cornelius. 
  All right, George, you wanted it old school. 
  [DOORBELL RINGS] 
  Thanks for coming so quickly. 
  Yeah, no worries. 
  Erm, so what are we looking at? 
  Oh, through there. 
  HALLIDAY: So, Jeremy Lake's gone to ground. 
  He's holed up somewhere getting people to come to him. 
  How are we supposed to find him? 
  There are like, 60,000 streets in London. 
  And previous murders, they don't tell us anything. 
  There there's no pattern. 
  They're random. 
  But they're not disorganised, are they? 
  I mean, everything he's doing, he's doing to tell himself how clever he is. 
  Oh, the audacity of that. 
  I mean, he can take care of whoever he wants whenever he wants. 
  He can have the police run around in circles. 
  He can make the police blame the wrong man and then he's come to an end. 
  Which means he's gone somewhere of significance, with meaning. 
 
 
 
  - To who? 
  - To us. 
  To him. 
  And if you were him, right, where's the most audacious place you could go? 
  [SIGHS] 
  If I were him, I would go home. 
  No. 
  Too big a police presence. 
  Where's the next best equivalent? 
  Well, if I couldn't go to where the police are, I'd go to where they just left. 
  Left. 
  Right, yes. 
  Ballarat Street. 
  The schoolteacher. 
  Yeah. 
  Should we tell someone? 
  No. 
  Not until we've checked it out. 
  - Are you sure? 
  - I am sure. 
  Come on.

  Martin, I think it's time maybe we discussed getting me some legal protection? 
  I can't pull it together, George. 
  I've tried, but I can't work out what happened. 
  I need a show of goodwill. 
  An upfront payment. 
  Right now. 
  [SNIFFLES] 
  [HANDCUFFS UNLOCK] 
  [SNIFFLES] 
  Now, I told you, Martin, your lads a wrong'un. 
  [MOBILE RINGING] 
  - Hey, Boss. 
  - MARTIN: [ON PHONE] 
  Yes, Halliday. 
  Are you with DCI Luther? 
  Yeah, I am. 
  SCHENK: Now, I need you to listen to me, very carefully. 
  Without alerting DCI Luther to this order, I need you to bring him back to the station as soon as possible. 
  Okay, yeah. 
  SCHENK: If you alert him to this, there is every chance that he will run, do you understand me? 
  Yep, got it. 
  Good. 
  Now, get him back to the station. 
  Tell him I have some interesting news. 
  And I want to give him it face to face. 
  Schenk has asked you to bring me back in, hasn't he? 
  Er, yeah. 
  Yeah, he said that he's got some news, something he wants to tell you. 
  Fair dues. 
  I'm not going anywhere until this is dealt with. 
  You think he's in there? 
  - I know he is. 
  - How? 
  [INHALES SHARPLY] 
  Plumber's van. 
  Pest control. 
  Food delivery. 
  All people that would come to you. 
  We can get back up in nine, ten minutes. 
  We've got no evidence. 
  [SIGHS] 
  If we call it in, we'll have to go through due process. 
  Get a warrant. 
  It would go on and on and on and what does that mean for anyone that's alive in there now? 
  [INHALES SHARPLY] 
  If you found out tomorrow that if we went in there today you could have saved someone's life,  
  - would you be okay with that? 
  - Boss, that's not fair. 
  All right, do what you have to do.

  Are you okay? 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  You should know, Schenk's on his way. 
  You called it in, didn't you? 
  You You know they're coming for me, right? 
  Yeah. 
  What did you do? 
  Nothing I can't fix. 
  I just need time. 
  Are you are you asking me to to let you go? 
  Catherine, I have to go, okay? 
  It's a mess. 
  But it's not what it looks like, I promise you that. 
  Can I stop you from leaving? 
  No. 
  Then I won't try. 
  John? 
  Did you use me as bait in there? 
  Send me downstairs to lure him out? 
  No. 
  I think you did. 
  I think you dragged me here and threw me in front of him so that you could be the man to stop him. 
  That is not what happened. 
  [GUNSHOT] 
  So what did happen? 
  Why are you making such a fuss? 
  I mean, this is what happens, isn't it, to those of us who are no longer useful. 
  [GASPING] 
  ALICE: Who's next, hmm? 
  Could it be me, I wonder? 
  Well, no. 
  [STUTTERS] 
  I won't let that happen, John. 
  I can't allow it. 
  JOHN: She did nothing to you, Alice! 
  Neither did my parents, really, or Henry Madsen. 
  Or Ian Reed. 
  It never seemed to You never seemed to mind, really, though, did you? 
  Well, what are you going to do this time, DCI Luther? 
  Arrest me? 
  Well yes, you should! 
  But you won't, will you? 
  You'll let me go. 
  Because think of the tales I could tell. 
  But how? 
  How are you going to cover this up, I wonder? 
  - [WAILING SIRENS APPROACHING] 
  - What lies can you tell? 
  Quick, John, think of a lie. 
  Come on, come on, think of a lie! 
  Put it down. 
  Make me, liar. 
  Liar!

  How many more bullets, Alice? 
  Come and see, John. 
  Honestly, I'm embarrassed. 
  I can't believe it took me so long to see that Zoe was right about you. 
  You don't care about anyone, John. 
  Not unless they can feed your compulsions. 
  Friends, enemies, it's all the same to you. 
  It doesn't matter. 
  Even Zoe, you loved her so much more  
  - when she was dead. 
  - You need to stop. 
  It gave you an excuse to behave exactly how you wanted. 
  JOHN: You need help. 
  It's just words, isn't it, Alice? 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - Just words! 
  Trying to justify what you really came here to do. 
  And what's that? 
  Please do tell me. 
  Well, free yourself! 
  From this. 
  From me and you. 
  You keep coming back, and coming back, and coming back, but you're never going to get what you want, Alice. 
  Never. 
  Because what I want doesn't exist. 
  JOHN: No. 
  So how many more bullets, Alice? 
  Yeah, well, I've got enough.

  [GIGGLES] 
  Of course, you are.

  [GROANS] 
  The thing is, John, you don't understand love. 
  You can mimic it, you can recognise it in others, but you can never understand it. 
  [SIGHS DEEPLY] 
  Is this it? 
  Is this it? 
  Love? 
  Yes. 
  Guess what? 
  I lied, too. 
  There's one bullet left. 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY]
