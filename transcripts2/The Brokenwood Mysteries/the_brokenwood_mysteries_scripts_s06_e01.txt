  Did your mother know best when she left me in charge of you? 
  (DOG WHINES) 
  Yeah, that's what I thought. 
  (EERIE MUSIC) 
  Evening! 
  Why, it is indeed, sir! 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  (HORN HONKS RAPIDLY) 
  Good morrow! 
  (DOG BARKS) 
  OK. 
  (PANTS) 
  This town gets weirder every year. 
  Yeah. 
  Steampunk is, Mike. 
  Not really my thing, but you've got to admire the creativity, I guess. 
  Mm. 
  I never picked you to be a corgi guy. 
  Friend of a friend. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  I'm about to head out to the lookout. 
  Wanna join me? 
  Oh, I'd love to, but he struggles with the hills. 
  You know, short legs. 
  OK. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Hey, corgis are cute. 
  But look out, cos they're one of the more deadlier breeds. 
  Ciao! 
  - Come on. 
  Yah!

  # I met her in the comic shop. 
  My heart started bumping. 
  # She saw me with her camera eye. 
  Her pistons were pumping. 
  # My girlfriend is a robot- a mechanical dream. 
  # Her coals glowed hot, burning love into steam. 
  # I made her cogs and knobs and gears all go a-clatter, cos I'm her man made of organic matter.

  Thank you! 
  Thank you. 
  And now, please welcome our leader - Ace Dirigible Pilot, Captain J. R. 
  Brocklesby! 
  (CHEERING) 
  Thank you! 
  (MICROPHONE FEEDBACK SCREECHES) 
  Salutations, all! 
  And welcome to the annual Brokenwood Aeronaut Steampunk Convivial. 
  Huzzah! 
  ALL: Huzzah! 
  I wish to offer my heartfelt gratitude to Mrs Winsley, for providing such sumptuous vittles. 
  (CHEERING) 
  And, of course, to Dr Devious for his devilish libation. 
  (RAPTUROUS CHEERING) 
  As you know, each year, we fundraise to take us all down to the Grand Steampunk Festival in Oamaru, and ifs a wonderful time. 
  Lord knows it's expensive too. 
  So this year, I decree that the Brokenwood Aeronauts will not be launching an official contingent to the festival. 
  (CROWD MUTTERS) 
  Fear not, my friends. 
  All is not lost. 
  No. 
  To elaborate, I'd like to invite the town big bug - the Right Honourable Mr Neil Bloom! 
  (LAUGHS, APPLAUDS) 
  Come on here! 
  Yes! 
  (CROWD MUTTERS SOFTLY) 
  Gosh, look at you. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  (MICROPHONE FEEDBACK SCREECHES) 
  Uh, thank you, Alden. 
  I have to admit, I don't fully understand what, uh, steampunk is, (CHUCKLES) 
  or what's going on here, but I have it on good authority from my nephew, Bart, that is a lot of fun, and I'm assured by Captain Brocklesby that it celebrates diversity. 
  Oh, absolutely. 
  And if Brokenwood is to be known for one thing, it should be inclusiveness. 
  (CROWD EXCLAIMS IN AGREEMENT) 
  Which is why the District Council has agreed to support the first ever official Brokenwood Steampunk Festival! 
  (ALL CHEER) 
  Magnificent news! 
  Magnificent news, and hear me - it shall be bigger, better, grander by far! 
  (CHEERING INTENSIFIES) 
  We shall be the talk of all things steam. 
  The Brokenwood Aeronauts shall reign supreme! 
  Huzzah! 
  CROWD: Huzzah! 
  Now, let's all get slaughtered! 
  (CHEERING, WHISTLING) 
  This one's called 'Steampunk The Funk. 
  ' A-one, two, three, four!

  These fireworks, ladies and gents, have been banned in 50 countries!

  Typical. 
  Just finishing up a lovely Sunday roast lamb. 
  Ooh. 
  The Roxy Special. 
  Breen Special, actually. 
  Ooh. 
  You? 
  Oh, nothing fancy. 
  Can of soup. 
  Ooh. 
  You been on the soups a lot since you and Kahu broke up. 
  You should come around after. 
  There's leftovers. 
  As I have already explained, Kahu and I haven't broken up. 
  Right. 
  You're just not seeing each other. 
  (SIGHS) 
  He's 60 miles off-shore working on an oil rig, and I don't do long-distance relationships. 
  Got it. 
  Ooh. 
  I see budget cuts have really hit the dog section this year. 
  (DOG WHIMPERS) 
  Belongs to the senior. 
  He's just round the corner. 
  Mike's got a dog? 
  That's a mid-life crisis. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  It's a corgi. 
  Hardly the sports car of the canine world. 
  (EERIE MUSIC) 
  (EXTINGUISHER HISSES) 
  (SIGHS) 
  I think I might pass on the roast lamb. 
  Yeah, copy that. 
  Oh, hold up. 
  We've got a biohazard. 
  So far, one confirmed fatality - a Lionel Bridges. 
  Another male rushed to hospital in serious condition. 
  The hell happened here? 
  Steampunk Club party thing. 
  Portaloo exploded. 
  Do we know what caused it? 
  Suspected gas leak. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  What? 
  Didn't say anything. 
  There was a propane gas bottle visible, but we can't get in there until the hazmat team have deemed the area safe. 
  You should walk in single file. 
  Less chance of stepping on another mine. 
  I highly doubt a landmine caused this. 
  What else? 
  Uh, probably quite a few things. 
  Such as? 
  Well, that's what we're here to investigate. 
  But no answers yet, so you should consider the worst case scenario. 
  In Russia, there is a saying - 'Life is like a landmine. 
  ' 'Life is like a landmine' Every step you take might be your last. 
  You Russians are a cheery bunch (!) 
  Try to be. 
  Mike, the victim is in several pieces. 
  This will take some time. 
  And nothing doing until hazmat give you the all-clear? 
  Good things happen to those who wait, Mike. 
  Right. 
  Witnesses. 
  Let's see if this is anything more than a freak accident. 
  Well, an exploding Portaloo. 
  Nothing suspicious about that. 
  (BIRDSONG) 
  Victim - Lionel Bridges. 
  60 years old, owner of the Brokenwood Models and Trains Shop. 
  Also founding member of the Aeronauts Steampunk Society. 
  Do we know what steampunk is yet? 
  Um quite strange? 
  Mm. 
  Yeah, I can corroborate that. 
  Hm. 
  Lionel is also the father of one of the members. 
  Uh, Poppy, do you recall where you were at the time of the blast? 
  Seriously? 
  (GASPS) 
  Her dad has just been killed. 
  All right. 
  Um, sorry. 
  Uh, look, this can wait. 
  It's Cleo, yeah? 
  Can I organise you two a ride home'? 
  Yeah. 
  (SOBS) 
  (BREATHES SHAKILY) 
  Are you hurt? 
  She's embarrassed cos she wet herself. 
  Poppy! 
  We were outside, watching the fireworks display when it happened. 
  When, 'boom. 
  ' I see. 
  Well, don't worry. 
  It happens. 
  Shock, you think? 
  Maybe. 
  Probably didn't help that she'd been drinking. 
  Actually, most of them seemed pretty drunk, or, as they like to say in their steampunk vernacular, 'Full as a tick. 
  Soaked. 
  Sloshed. 
  Fully roostered. 
  ' Yeah. 
  For a bunch of nerds, they really like to get on it. 
  The owner of the Portaloos - uh, Tim Werner - was certainly embodying all of those terms. 
  Has anything like this ever happened to one of your Portaloos before? 
  Timmie Time Toilet Tanks don't explode. 
  That wouldn't be very good word of mouth. 
  What was the gas tank for? 
  Oof. 
  Huh? 
  Hey- Whoa- Hey! 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Hey, hey, hey. 
  ls there someone we can call? 
  No, no. 
  Uh, I'm OK. 
  (KEYS JANGLE) 
  (COUGHS, GROANS) 
  Oh, uh, no, no, no. 
  Let's, urn We'll get you a ride home, eh? 
  OK. 
  SLURRING: I just gotta use the toilet. 
  No, no. 
  No, no. 
  You can't. 
  It blew up, right? 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  Smelt like the floor of the Frog and Cheetah. 
  How do you know what the floor of the Frog and Cheetah smells like? 
  I'll follow up today. 
  Is it possible a firework hit the gas tank? 
  Yeah, possible, but unlikely. 
  We got a licence for them! 
  You don't need a licence for fireworks, Nigel. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  OK! 
  Well, we read all the safety precautions on the box. 
  Jesus! 
  Sony! 
  We bought them off a stall on the side of the road. 
  Honestly, they were rubbish, really. 
  Did any of them go near the Portaloo? 
  Most of them didn't go anywhere at all. 
  And the owner of the hangar - he flies hot air balloons? 
  Yes. 
  Uh, Alden Coombes. 
  Still in hospital. 
  They're going to update me when he regains consciousness. 
  Now, um, are we going to talk about the dog-shaped elephant in the room? 
  Willie? 
  I'm looking after him for a friend. 
  Mm. . 
  A, uh, female friend? 
  Hm, possibly a girlfriend? 
  - (CELL PHONE RINGS) 
  - (CLEARS THROAT) 
  Gina. 
  Mike, I have finished assembling the body, minus one piece. 
  It was challenging. 
  It reminded of Tetris. 
  I'm on my way. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Right. 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  Come on, Willie. 
  Let's go. 
  Uh, Mike? 
  Dog, mortuary. 
  Still got Charred body parts. 
  Right. 
  I see your point. 
  Um Here. 
  What? 
  (WILLIE PANTS) 
  (CURIOUS GUITAR MUSIC) 
  Given that he was at the epicentre of the blast, I'm surprised he's in such good shape. 
  Shapes, Mike. 
  He's in shapes. 
  But the walls of the portable toilet were plastic, so the energy of the blast was dispersed. 
  If they were made of concrete, he would have been liquefied. 
  Pink mist. 
  Anything of note? 
  Hmm His lungs show signs of heavy smoking, his liver was inflamed, blood alcohol very high. 
  His bladder was empty, and he had fish and chips for an early dinner - probably around 5:30pm. 
  But most interesting the lighter had been fused with the skin. 
  I found what remains of a packet of cigarettes too. 
  So we have a probable source of ignition? 
  Good work. 
  I'm not just a pretty face, Mike. 
  No. 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  Uh, you said you were missing a piece. 
  Yes. 
  My Tetris is incomplete. 
  (CELL PHONE RINGS) 
  Sims. 
  Forensics have found the remains of a hose attached to the propane tank, and it appears strips of duct tape were covering the ventilation holes of the Portaloo. 
  Someone purposely filled it with gas. 
  And Lionel Bridges had a cigarette lighter in his hand when he died. 
  What? 
  Some kind of elaborate suicide attempt? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Unlikely, no. 
  Then someone had it in for Lionel. 
  Seems that way. 
  Carry on. 
  Oh, and have a look out for his left ear. 
  Wait, what? 
  Did you say 'an ear'? 
  (PHONE CLICKS) 
  Hello? 
  (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
  (JAUNTY COUNTRY MUSIC) 
  (TRAIN WHISTLE TOOTS) 
  (WHISTLE TOOTS) 
  (MUSIC FADES) 
  Lime? 
  Uh, salt. 
  Brokenwood doesn't have a lime quarry. 
  (WHISTLE TOOTS) 
  I can watch it go around for hours and hours. 
  I mean, even though it's the same, it's like there's always something new. 
  Bart, you work for Lionel? 
  Part-time. 
  You knew him well? 
  He was like a father to me. 
  We can put you in touch with a grief counsellor. 
  I don't know. 
  I'll be OK. 
  Do you think you're up to giving me that statement now? 
  (DOOR ALARM CHIMES) 
  I might have known I'd find you in this place. 
  It's not a good thing for you to be here today. 
  It's morbid. 
  Morbid, Bartie. 
  Mum, Lionel loved this place. 
  I'm showing my respects, all right? 
  Well, you show your respect by looking after yourself. 
  Tell him. 
  STAMMERS: I was surprised to see the shop open. 
  See? 
  See what this man says? 
  Mum. 
  Oh, um, I'm sorry about last night. 
  I might have come across a bit brusque. 
  Get away from him! 
  Go on! 
  Shoo! 
  (WHIMPERS) 
  Ma'am, she's a paramedic. 
  And who are you? 
  DSS Mike Shepherd. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  My son doesn't need a detective. 
  He needs a doctor! 
  I was overwhelmed by everything. 
  I understand. 
  How about we get a cup of tea at the station? 
  Get that statement? 
  (CURIOUS ACOUSTIC MUSIC) 
  OK. 
  What have we got, team? 
  Uh, the likely source of the propane tank at the party. 
  Storage for all of Alden Coombes' hot air balloon propellant - left unlocked. 
  (METAL CREAKS) 
  Uh, also, this length of steel was found jammed in what remains of the Portaloo door. 
  It would have prevented the door being opened from the inside. 
  Which means we're definitely not dealing with a suicide. 
  Could be off the junk decorating the Portaloo. 
  Or should I say 'Timmie Time Toilet Tank'? 
  You provided them to the party for free - is that correct? 
  Oh, for sure! 
  Sponsorship. 
  Gotta be prepared to do some pro bono work for name exposure in the first few years of a start-up company. 
  'Timmie Time'. 
  It's an interesting name for your brand. 
  Yeah. 
  It's pretty cool, right? 
  I did a business course. 
  You've got to make it a personal connection to what you're offering. 
  That's the key to success. 
  Even though you're associating your name with going to the toilet? 
  Oh, totally! 
  I mean, every time you feel the urge, and you think, 'Ooh, it's Timmie time,' that's, like, ka-ching for me. 
  That's what winning feels like. 
  (BRUSH SCRATCHES) 
  Where was he at the time of the explosion? 
  Supposedly watching the fireworks, as was everyone else, it seems. 
  Yeah, great display! 
  Best I've seen in a while. 
  (BRUSH SCRATCHES) 
  I heard it was pretty average. 
  Yeah. 
  Right. 
  Yeah. 
  (SCRATCHING CONTINUES) 
  Do you know of any reason why anyone would want to hurt Lionel Bridges? 
  Don't know. 
  I wouldn't call him a friend, but he was passionate about the cause. 
  The cause being steampunk? 
  Sorry. 
  I feel terrible. 
  (GRUNTS) 
  Well, that's understandable. 
  You've lost a member of your group. 
  Yeah, nah. 
  I smothered a parrot last night. 
  OK. 
  You what? 
  I smothered a parrot. 
  (CROWD CHEERING) 
  MAN: Say hello to the green fairy! 
  In steampunk, when we drink absinthe, we smother a parrot. 
  Ah! 
  (SUCKS TEETH) 
  (SHUDDERS) 
  OK. 
  Well, your witness consumed absinthe, so nothing he says is gonna be reliable. 
  Not necessarily. 
  Mm. . 
  Speaking from experience? 
  No. 
  Roxy did it once at uni, though. 
  She thought she was flying on a cloud with a flock of ducks, heading north for the winter. 
  Then, the next morning, she went down to the park, found her air mattress floating in the duck pond. 
  What is your point exactly? 
  All I'm saying is Tim Werner has been more than helpful. 
  Whose idea was it to decorate the, uh, Timmie Tanks? 
  Lionel's. 
  Ah! 
  (LAUGHS) 
  You're a lifesaver, Tim. 
  And you'll, uh, give them a plug during your speech? 
  Yeah, of course. 
  They're very plastic. 
  High durability, easy clean. 
  What is it with Islanders and bright colours? 
  God's sake, man. 
  I wouldn't know, being Maori. 
  Well, you're all from the same islands. 
  About 500 years before you left yours. 
  Got the jump on you there. 
  All I'm saying is that these fluoro monstrosities don't exactly fit in with the cause. 
  All right! 
  All right. 
  I could change my mind about not charging you. 
  No, no, no! 
  They're perfect! 
  They're perfect. 
  Perhaps we could get a little creative. 
  Just as long as people still see the name. 
  Oh, yes. 
  Absolutely. 
  Did Lionel always speak like that? 
  Don't know. 
  But in my line of work, you get used to dealing with white male crap. 
  So it was actually Alden's idea to decorate them? 
  Well, come to think of it, yeah. 
  He wanted them to blend in with the theme, I guess. 
  Steampunk Portaloos. 
  Timmie Time Toilet Tanks. 
  Yeah. 
  Decorate or disguise? 
  Alden Coombes is still unconscious. 
  I'm getting regular updates. 
  Good, cos that wrought iron brick wrap would have camouflaged the pipe from the gas tank. 
  How bothered do you think was Tim Werner by Lionel's comment? 
  Hmm. 
  He mostly seemed worried about brand exposure. 
  And I'm no closer to figuring out what steampunk is. 
  I am, thanks to Bart Bloom. 
  It's a genre of science-fantasy. 
  It can be music, movies, role playing - anything. 
  Often, it imagines an alternate future where steam power is still king, and Victorian sensibilities and designs still prevail. 
  It's about taking ideas from the past and transforming them into something new. 
  It clearly means a lot to you. 
  Steampunk, you can be whoever you want to be. 
  An escape from the things you don't like about your own life. 
  Uh, Lionel Bridges and Alden Coombes founded the Brokenwood Aeronauts together back in 2004. 
  Alden was the charismatic leader, but Lionel was the one with integrity. 
  Yeah, he made you feel like you weren't just dressing up - that you were creating a better world. 
  I'm still hearing 'cult. 
  ' Every year, they fundraise to send themselves to Oamaru. 
  Apparently, there's a big steampunk festival down there. 
  Only, I didn't get to go. 
  Your health? 
  Yeah, but this year was gonna be different. 
  Uncle Neil finally agreed that we'd have our own festival up here. 
  I was so happy, and it was all because of Lionel. 
  Bart, can you think of any reason why anybody would want to hurt Lionel? 
  He was just a nice man who ran a model train store, and (INHALES DEEPLY) 
  Uh, if you need to, the bathroom's second on the right, down the hall. 
  I'd prefer to use my own bathroom. 
  (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
  Uh, Elsa Bloom is wondering how much longer. 
  And, um, she asked me to tell you she's worried about your water retention. 
  Mothers - can't live with 'em, can't live without them keeping tabs on your bladder. 
  So Lionel Bridges is a gentle, quiet soul with no enemies who someone just decided to blow to smithereens. 
  What is the explosion wasn't the goal here? 
  I mean, Lionel's been drinking. 
  The offender then jams the door shut, having taped the ventilation holes, pumping it full of gas. 
  By the time Lionel smelled the gas, if he smelled it at all, he's trapped in there. 
  And with everyone watching the fireworks, nobody hears his screams. 
  He'd pass out in minutes, be dead in a few more. 
  The offender then removes the tank, removes the tape, and leaves Lionel to be discovered - dead on the dunny, just like Elvis. 
  Only problem is, instead of peanut butter sandwiches, Lionel's vice was cigarettes. 
  Smoking kills! 
  But propane gas is, like, a really bad, stinky egg smell. 
  How did he not notice? 
  (PHONE CHIMES) 
  It's a Portaloo. 
  Right. 
  Yeah. 
  Alden Coombes has regained consciousness. 
  (BELL DING-S) 
  Do you want to go get a coffee? 
  Yeah, sure. 
  No, not you. 
  Get back to Tim Werner. 
  We need to know how quickly that Portaloo can be filled with gas. 
  Hm. 
  Come on, Willie. 
  This way. 
  Go. 
  Yep. 
  Nope! 
  CLEO: He seems very wise. 
  (WILLIE PANTS) 
  I'll take your word for it. 
  Uh, I know it's hard, but last night- Doesn't seem real. 
  I keep expecting him to call or come walking round the corner. 
  Is your mother still around? 
  Nah. 
  She ran off when Poppy was a baby. 
  She left Lionel to raise her on his own. 
  They barely speak. 
  Tough. 
  ls there any other family around? 
  She's got me now, eh, babe'? 
  Doesn't need anyone else. 
  Poppy, we're concerned that your father's death wasn't an accident. 
  Do you know of anyone that might have wanted to have hurt Lionel? 
  Definitely not her mum, if that's what you mean. 
  She lives in Australia. 
  What was your last memory of seeing him last night? 
  Urn, it was later in the night. 
  I'll see you outside? 
  Just before the fireworks. 
  Did your father approve of your relationship? 
  Not really. 
  Yep. 
  I mean, maybe he was a little protective sometimes, but all dads are. 
  He meant well, didn't he? 
  Yeah, he did. 
  Urn, we have that victim support thingy. 
  Can we go? 
  Oh, of course. 
  I'll be in touch if we have any more questions. 
  Bye, Willie. 
  (MYSTERIOUS GUITAR MUSIC) 
  Heard about Lionel Bridges. 
  Messed up way to go. 
  You knew Lionel? 
  Nah, mate. 
  I'm not into that kinky stuff. 
  What do you mean 'kinky'? 
  Model trains. 
  Yeah. 
  Nah, never even met the guy. 
  Well, except for one time. 
  (WHISTLE TOOTS) 
  It was back when I was smoking the buds. 
  I remember he was a bit intense. 
  Humbug? 
  Beautiful, aren't they? 
  Would you like to come inside? 
  (LAUGHS) 
  It's great to see young men taking an interest in precision engines from the golden age. 
  Tell me - have you ever considered making a steampunk persona? 
  You- Like a pasta dish? 
  He was confusing, which is why I don't smoke that stuff anymore. 
  Frodo, just to clarify - do you think Lionel was making advances towards you? 
  No way. 
  No. 
  Definitely not. 
  I don't think so. 
  Do you reckon? 
  Thanks. 
  Uh, great coffee, as always. 
  Hey, Detective Shepherd - is this not your dog? 
  (TRUCK ENGINE WHIRRS) 
  Go on, Willie. 
  Come on. 
  Come on. 
  Come- Come on. 
  See ya. 
  Have a good day. 
  Mr Coombes currently has no memory of the incident. 
  The few things that he has said are quite strange. 
  Apart from some superficial burns, he's got a mild concussion and some temporary hearing loss, so please keep it brief. 
  I appreciate it. 
  Oh, and hey - I- I'm really sorry to hear about you and Kahu. 
  How do you know about that? 
  Oh, just just heard. 
  But you know, if you're ever at a loose end, you're welcome to come round for dinner. 
  A woman can't live on soup alone. 
  Thanks. 
  Uh, I'll let you know. 
  (DOOR SQUEAKS, CLOSES) 
  (MONITOR BEEPS STEADILY) 
  Poppy- Uh, Mr Coombes, I'm Detective Kristin Sims. 
  Sorry, what? 
  I can't hear over this blasted ringing. 
  Can you hear it? 
  Um, Alden, I'm Detective Kristin Sims. 
  Mm. 
  You're a Mutton Shunter. 
  What? 
  Blue Bottle. 
  A Miltonian. 
  Well, I'm a detective. 
  That's what I said. 
  Do you know where you are'? 
  Uh Blasted infirmary on the Airship Europa? 
  Uh, you've had a concussion, Mr Coombes. 
  There was an accident. 
  Do you recall? 
  I don't. 
  Nothing. 
  Mm. . 
  Well, there was a gas explosion involving one of the Portaloos. 
  Oh, dear. 
  I'm sorry to say that your friend, Lionel Bridges, was killed. 
  Lionel? 
  No. 
  We believe the Portaloo had been filled with propane gas. 
  Lionel Bridges - gone? 
  Yes. 
  (LABOURED BREATHING) 
  Uh, Mr Coombes, on your property, there is a shed containing four propane gas tanks. 
  Do you remember locking that shed? 
  Oh, always. 
  Even/thing's stored away. 
  Safety first. 
  (GROANS) 
  Lionel Percival Pottersmore Esquire - dead. 
  I can't believe it. 
  He was sound on the goose. 
  Someone to ride the river with. 
  He loved the Maw Blaine. 
  Mary Blaine being his girlfriend? 
  Trains, woman. 
  He loved the trains. 
  Uh, what about a spare key to your shed? 
  Oh, it That's the only one. 
  So, it was an accident? 
  No. 
  We believe this was a deliberate act. 
  Someone on purpose? 
  Yes. 
  Hm. 
  Do you remember locking your- Oh. 
  No, no. 
  No. 
  Alden. 
  Alden, stay put! 
  (YELPS, GROANS) 
  (MONITOR BEEPS RAPIDLY) 
  (GROANS) 
  What's going on in here? 
  Uh, he fell. 
  That's enough, Detective. 
  Please. 
  Please. 
  (SIGHS) 
  (BEEPING STOPS) 
  Come on, Mr Coombes. 
  I'm sorry. 
  It's all right. 
  You're fine. 
  You're fine, Mr Coombes. 
  (UPBEAT COUNTRY MUSIC) 
  # Livin' out of a suitcase, # down to my last blue jeans. 
  # Truck stop coffee and the same white lines # every road I've seen. 
  # Fall asleep looking at your picture. 
  # Wake up saying your name. 
  # I understand you were at the party earlier in the evening to announce a steampunk festival. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  Sorry about the delay. 
  Though I doubt that'll be happening any more. 
  It's a shame. 
  Alden worked so hard on it. 
  Well, Alden and Lionel. 
  In different ways, yes. 
  How well did you know Lionel Bridges? 
  (SNICKERS) 
  Mainly knew him as the guy who always emailed me about re-opening the Brokenwood train line. 
  Do you happen to know if he was Gay? 
  Mm. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Not that I knew of. 
  And I would know, since we all have those secret meetings once a month (!) 
  Well, just trying to keep an open mind. 
  Looking for motives. 
  (GLASS CLATTERS) 
  Not as far as I knew. 
  In fact, a bit more of an open mind could have done Lionel some good. 
  Fire jugglers, knife throwing, steam-powered jetpack testing. 
  Hot air balloon rides combined with free homemade whisky tasting for all. 
  Yeah. 
  This, uh, all sounds very dangerous. 
  No, no, no, no, no. 
  Not at all. 
  No. 
  The, uh, Brokenwood Steampunk Festival will be a fun, safe environment for the whole family. 
  Did I mention balloon rides? 
  During the negotiations, Lionel brought up wanting to keep undesirables out of the festival. 
  It needs to be purely about commitment to invention. 
  At first, I thought that sounded reasonable, but then, I tweaked to what he actually meant. 
  No riff-raff or degenerates trying to sexualise or politicise it. 
  What exactly do you mean by that, Mr Bridges? 
  Well, he means to keep out highwaymen and thieves. 
  Blaggards! 
  That's not what I mean. 
  You know what I'm saying. 
  The bloody LGBT P brigade. 
  They want to make everything a statement these days. 
  Stearnpunk is not an excuse for them to dress up in lace and swan around in public, fondling each other's- (THUD!) 
  Ow! 
  Well, if there's no fondling I'm afraid the festival's off the table. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  I should have know you wouldn't understand. 
  (CHAIR SCRAPES) 
  Honestly, I was kind of impressed he'd had the audacity to talk to me like that. 
  But, (CHUCKLES) 
  No, I mean it. 
  Any more talk about exclusion, this festival idea goes no further. 
  Oh, he doesn't mean it! 
  He's just very passionate about making sure the event is a success. 
  Steampunk is about inclusivity. 
  That's the entire point. 
  Lionel Bridges will not stand in the way of a successful festival - I promise you. 
  What do you think Alden meant by that? 
  That he would blow him up in a portable commode. 
  Sorry. 
  Too soon? 
  I took it to mean that he would resist Lionel's rabid homophobia. 
  At least, I hope that's what he meant. 
  Your nephew, Bart, is an Aeronaut. 
  Yeah. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Yeah, the group's really brought him out of his shell. 
  He's, uh, he's quite an insular young man. 
  Caused by his health problem? 
  My, uh, brother walked out on them many years ago. 
  It had a lasting impact. 
  Elsa raised him on her own? 
  I try and help out when I can, not that it's welcome. 
  Because? 
  I suspect every time she sees me, I'm a reminder of the pain my brother caused. 
  OK. 
  Uh, thanks. 
  Mm. 
  Did you know Lionel's daughter was in a lesbian relationship? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Yeah. 
  People like Lionel Bridges have a remarkable ability to look the other way when it suits them. 
  Hm. 
  Blowing up Lionel Bridges required serious planning. 
  Planning requires clear motive. 
  According to both Frodo and Bart Bloom, Lionel showed a keen interest in young men, contradicted by the fact that he was reportedly homophobic. 
  Lionel wanted gay people specifically excluded from his prized festival. 
  So, he was closeted? 
  Neil Bloom believes not. 
  But his daughter's gay. 
  Which gives motive to both Poppy and Cleo. 
  I mean, if Lionel stood in the way of their relationship somehow, how angry were they? 
  Poppy stands to inherit some money, possibly even the shop. 
  As did Cleo, vicariously. 
  Where does Bart fit in all this? 
  Hm. 
  He's a curious one. 
  Health issues, abandonment issues, possibly OCD. 
  But he looked up to Lionel- kind of a father figure. 
  How'd you get on with Tim Werner? 
  We did some tests this afternoon. 
  The internal cavity is 1. 
  8m3. 
  So, at 40 litres a minute (TAPE RIPS) 
  we'd need (GRUNTS) 
  What are you doing? 
  I'm taping up the ventilation holes so that it fills up with the gas faster. 
  I didn't ask you to do that. 
  Yeah, but it's just common sense, right? 
  Do you remember who you were standing next to while you were watching the fireworks? 
  Uh, let me think. 
  None of our witnesses can actually place you. 
  OK. 
  Well, when I told you I was watching the fireworks, I was, just not with anybody else. 
  (FIREWORKS SQUEAL) 
  (CROWD CHEERING) 
  (EXPLOSION DISTORTS) 
  (LEAVES RUSTLE) 
  (FIREWORKS HOWL) 
  But I remember someone standing over me for a bit, definitely. 
  Who was it. 
  I dunno. 
  Well, what did they look like? 
  A bush. 
  A bush? 
  A bush-shaped person. 
  You think it's possible this bush-shaped person could have just been a bush? 
  (FINGERS CLICK) 
  Or even a tree. 
  (INQUISITIVE MUSIC) 
  You buying that? 
  I'm dealing with a guy who smothered a parrot. 
  Anyway, it took approximately 90 seconds to fill the Portaloo with propane. 
  Right. 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  The short length of hose suggests that the gas bottle was positioned behind the Portaloo. 
  Which offers that the most obvious place for the offender to hide was here, around the side of the shed. 
  So, assuming the offender waited until Lionel got into the Portaloo, then jammed it shut, filled it with gas about 90 seconds before the explosion, we're looking for anyone that can't be accounted for during the entire fireworks display. 
  Well, that's Tim Werner, though he was potentially somewhere here. 
  Also, a witness has Poppy Bridges arriving after Cleo Jones, as did Bart Bloom. 
  And Alden Coombes can't recall where he was at the time of the explosion, but none of the other witnesses have him at the fireworks at all. 
  (INHALES DEEPLY) 
  Alden Coombes' memory loss is very convenient, isn't it? 
  (CURIOUS COUNTRY MUSIC) 
  (POUNDING ON DOOR) 
  DC Breen. 
  Ah. 
  About time. 
  I'm Wanda. 
  Right. 
  Uh, I'm looking for Cleo Jones. 
  Are you from the tenancy service? 
  I'm from the criminal investigation branch. 
  Of the tenancy service? 
  Of the police. 
  Cos I just filed a complaint with them about Cleo. 
  She took all her stuff to her girlfriend's place yesterday, I have to look for a new flatmate in, like, a week. 
  Total crap. 
  You're saying she's moved in with Poppy Bridges? 
  Do you know if she's there now? 
  Probably. 
  Those two are inseparable. 
  Or try their work - the pet shop. 
  Right. 
  Got it. 
  Thanks. 
  Wait. 
  Wait. 
  When you see her, give her this, and tell Cleo she's not getting her bond back. 
  (DOOR CLICKS) 
  (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
  Mr Coombes' situation yesterday transpired to be nothing more than a panic attack. 
  I know you've got a job to do, but take it easy, please? 
  At this stage of his recovery, it's important he avoid stress. 
  (DOOR SQUEAKS, CLOSES) 
  Well, That's one way to avoid it. 
  (INQUISITIVE ACOUSTIC MUSIC) 
  (SIGHS SOFTLY) 
  Ms Bloom. 
  Oh, I'm quite comfortable with you calling me Elsa. 
  Right. 
  Uh, Elsa, then. 
  How can I help? 
  It's probably more a case of how I can help you. 
  My son, Bart, has a variety of health issues, as you know. 
  One of his medications has a side effect - insomnia. 
  So, when he does sleep, it can be very fitful. 
  Last night, I overheard him sleeptalking in a a distressed and agitated way. 
  It was about Yes? 
  It would seem that Lionel Bridges and Alden Coombes had some sort of argument before the explosion. 
  Bart witnessed this? 
  I presume so, to be talking about it in his sleep. 
  He didn't mention it in his statement. 
  He was quite shaken. 
  Anyway, it may be nothing. 
  I just thought I should mention it. 
  Thanks, Elsa. 
  I'll talk to Bart again as soon as possible. 
  Why? 
  Well, to get Bart's version for more detail. 
  Of course. 
  I'll see myself out. 
  (LOW, EERIE MUSIC)

  (BELL DINGS) 
  Didn't we just I work here. 
  You didn't mention that. 
  You didn't ask. 
  Are you stalking me? 
  What? 
  No. 
  No, I'm a detective, as I said. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  You got a girlfriend? 
  Yes? 
  Does she know you're here? 
  Look- Look! 
  Poppy and Cleo - are they here? 
  Not here. 
  Well, you did say they worked here. 
  They're off today. 
  Sick leave. 
  Right, and you didn't tell me that because I didn't ask? 
  (ANIMAL SQUEAKS) 
  Nope. 
  Cleo texted after you left. 
  Said that Poppy's sad and can't be alone. 
  Or it could just be Cleo's afraid of the verbal smack-down coming her way. 
  (SIGHS) 
  It's extra crap because it's gonna be a really busy day. 
  (CURIOUS MUSIC) 
  Yeah, good luck with that (!) 
  It's not mine. 
  (PHONE RINGS) 
  Mike. 
  According to Elsa Bloom, Bart witnessed a heated argument between Alden and Lionel that night. 
  Can you ask him that? 
  I'll follow up Bart. 
  I'll be happy to. 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  Just as soon as I find him. 
  What? 
  He discharged himself from hospital via an open window. 
  His car's still outside his house. 
  The taxi company have no record. 
  For all we know, he could be passed out in a ditch somewhere. 
  So I've put out a 10-1, but as yet, nothing. 
  How does a grown man in a hospital gown just disappear? 
  Keep me posted. 
  Will do. 
  Hey, maybe this dude escaped by bicycle. 
  (VAPE HISSES) 
  (BELL DINGS, SPOKES CLICK) 
  (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC) 
  (BRAKES SQUEAK) 
  At first, I thought it was just some dude going senile. 
  My grandad sometimes opened the door completely nude- Thanks, Frodo! 
  (DOOR ALARM RINGS) 
  It really is impressive. 
  I've been helping Lionel build it since I was 11. 
  I even suggested a few bits, like the, uh the coal yards and the salt mine. 
  He always said that life was a work in progress, and only through working do we become better men. 
  I don't know what else to do. 
  (PAINTBRUSH CLATTERS) 
  Bart, tell me about the argument you witnessed between Alden and Lionel on the night of the party. 
  What argument? 
  Your mother said she heard you talking in your sleep. 
  (DOOR ALARM RINGS) 
  SIGHS: Oh, sorry. 
  Only me. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I was on my way home, and I, uh, saw you left your medication in the back of the car again. 
  Mum. 
  You're looking puffy. 
  I was, uh, just on my way home from talking with Detective Shepherd and telling him about the mutterings in your sleep where you- What were you doing in my room? 
  I wasn't in your room, dear, but you were being very loud. 
  STAMMERS: It's the medications. 
  Tell me what you remember. 
  Well, you said that he was threaten- Elsa, I'd like to hear it from Bart. 
  Uh, I think, uh, Alden was threatening Lionel. 
  And this argument was public? 
  No, it was by the Portaloos. 
  Elsa, please. 
  Well, that's what he said! 
  You wouldn't dare. 
  I'll make sure your precious festival dies before it's born Brocklesby. 
  (GRUNTS) 
  (SNICKERS) 
  I should kill you, you hypocritical b*st*rd. 
  No, Lionel never said that! 
  Bartie, it's what you told me. 
  I never told you anything. 
  Oh, you were fretting in your sleep. 
  What did he say? 
  I don't know. 
  But you were also by the Portaloos? 
  No, no. 
  No way. 
  So, where exactly were you? 
  Uh, I was on my way to watch the fireworks. 
  (INDISTINCT ARGUING) 
  And what do you think they were discussing? 
  The festival, I guess. 
  Well, surely that's a question you should be asking Mr Coombes. 
  Uh, it's on the agenda. 
  Well, mm. 
  I've got to, uh I've got to catch the pharmacy. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Mother's work is never done. 
  Bart, why didn't you mention this in your statement'? 
  (DOOR ALARM RINGS) 
  Because Lionel would never hurt Alden. 
  He was a good man. 
  STAMMERS: Would you like to see the new South Pacific SW1500 diesel locomotive? 
  We just got this in. 
  Another time, perhaps.

  (PHONE BEEPS) 
  You're lucky to be alive after a run-in with the notorious Starfire Jones (!) 
  Can we just focus on the bigger picture here, OK'? 
  How is Poppy Bridges so quickly over the death of her dad? 
  Yesterday, she's grieving. 
  Today, she's making short films about damsels in distress. 
  Bring them back in for another chat. 
  Gladly! 
  I couldn't face working today, but I couldn't sit around home either. 
  Dad's stuff is everywhere. 
  I suggested we did some work on the film. 
  Poppy gets really into it, and it worked. 
  It took her mind off her dad. 
  We're very sorry if it came across as insensitive. 
  I'm not the one who's grieving for my father. 
  I'm still sad and everything, OK? 
  l am. 
  lt's just so weird. 
  We're so sorry if it came across as insensitive. 
  Cleo, you've moved in with Poppy. 
  So? 
  You don't think it's a little rushed - moving in with someone less than two days after-T? 
  Poppy didn't want to be alone in that house. 
  It freaked her out. 
  Poppy, I need you to tell me a bit more about your relationship with your father. 
  He raised you alone? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Um Mum left when I was a baby, and he just never really got over that. 
  Are you close to your mum? 
  No. 
  I look like her, though. 
  As I got older, Lionel would start spending longer hours at the shop. 
  He said I wasn't allowed to come because I'd break the trains, but I think he just didn't want me around, reminding him. 
  Is that why you joined the Aeronauts - to spend time with him? 
  Yeah. 
  (SNIFFS) 
  It worked for a while. 
  You know, we'd both dress up and pretend to be other people. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Steampunk was like a life-size version of him playing with his trains. 
  It relaxed him. 
  He was more fun to be around. 
  It was nice. 
  (SNIFFS) 
  But then, um You fell in love? 
  Cleo was the new girl at work. 
  (BIRDS SQUAWK) 
  'You know when you meet someone, and just, like, straight away, 'you're being your most embarrassing selves with each other and neither of you seem to care at all?' But I gather Lionel didn't like the two of you being together? 
  He said I was making a fool of myself, but he meant him. 
  So, ifs fair to say your father was homophobic? 
  Just my luck (!) 
  (SNICKERS) 
  More than that, I got the sense that he didn't like women in general. 
  I need you to go through the whole night - as much as you can remember. 
  Can you do that for me? 
  SIMS: Try not to leave anything out. 
  OK. 
  OK. 
  Cleo says that she and Poppy arrived at the hangar together around 6:30, where they almost immediately ran into Alden. 
  Poppy is consistent on that. 
  Oh! 
  (BOTH CHUCKLE) 
  Now, here's a roguish pair! 
  What mischief are you two up to? 
  On your way to hijack a submersible, or to fleece a merchant train? 
  We thought we might rob a hot air balloon pilot. 
  Oh, I surrender! 
  I surrender! 
  Please! 
  I have a wife and children. 
  We know very well you have neither, Captain Brocklesby, you old scoundrel! 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  My dears. 
  Mm. 
  And before the revelries begin, I should tell you I have a surprise for you two. 
  Ooh, pray tell, Captain Brocklesby! 
  I won't ruin it, but suffice to say, it is big. 
  That's all I can say. 
  Other than our very own festival is to be had, and I'm appointing you two as my co-pilots. 
  (GASPS) 
  We shall forge a new era for the Aeronauts! 
  What about Dad? 
  Oh, your father won't be a problem - I assure you. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Oh, Benji! 
  Benji. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Why weren't you happy with Alden's decision? 
  It was cool, but it didn't fit with our plans. 
  She says they're leaving Brokenwood. 
  Apparently, they've been saving to travel the world together. 
  I'm not sure that's still on the cards as far as Poppy is concerned. 
  With Dad dead, Cleo and I will have to run the shop now and help with the festival. 
  God, so much to think about. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Tell me about the last time you saw Lionel. 
  Um (CHUCKLES) 
  To sexy hats. 
  (INHALES DEEPLY, SIGHS) 
  Hey, you two. 
  It was, uh, later that night, just before the fireworks. 
  I'll see you outside. 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

  (ORNAMENTS CLATTER) 
  You know what? 
  I am, POPPY- I'm very happy for you and Cleo. 
  (LAUGHS SOFTLY) 
  She's a lovely girl. 
  That does not sound like the Lionel Cleo talked to. 
  Mm, unless he had a personality transplant. 
  I was putting my double bass away, when (INDISTINCT CROWD CHATTER) 
  (OMINOUS MUSIC) 
  You. 
  And I tried to be chill, but he wasn't having it. 
  It's great news about the festival, isn't it? 
  Lionel, I got you a You've already got one. 
  Uh, one going spare? 
  That's kind. 
  Thanks, Bart. 
  I'm that kind of guy. 
  Bart's usually crazy shy. 
  He barely talks to us when he edits Poppy's movies. 
  You and Bart are friends? 
  He used to have a thing for Poppy. 
  I guess with parents leaving them both at a young age, he thought there was a connection. 
  But he made a dick of himself at her 21st, and I think he's been embarrassed about it ever since, so he just tries to be nice. 
  A toast to the Brokenwood Steampunk Festival! 
  (MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY) 
  Cleo, your topping hat- it looks exquisite. 
  How long did it take you to make? 
  I made it, for my daughter. 
  Took me months. 
  Poppy and I like to share. 
  She thinks it looks hot on me. 
  She's right. 
  It looks hot. 
  STAMMERS: If I had a hat that looked that good, I'd never take it off. 
  Thanks, Bart. 
  To sexy hats! 
  To sexy hats. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  (SLURPS) 
  I'll get some more, eh? 
  You should take that off. 
  Hey, you two. 
  Um, fireworks outside in a few minutes.

  Oh, yeah. 
  Grandad used to play it all the time. 
  Hm. 
  (GROANS) 
  (CHAIR SCRAPES) 
  Lionel didn't say he was happy for the two of you, did he? 
  Poppy, you need to be honest with us here, like Cleo has. 
  No, he didn't. 
  LIONEL: You look happy. 
  lam, Dad. 
  And I really want you to be happy for me. 
  (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY) 
  (ORNAMENTS CLATTER) 
  Funny. 
  All I really want is a piss and a durry. 
  I just didn't want that to be the last thing my father said to me - 'A piss and a durry. 
  ' Did he say anything else? 
  And when you're running my festival, remember - Alden's a traitorous b*st*rd. 
  (SLURPS) 
  Was he referring to Alden's decision to promote you and Cleo? 
  So he already knew about it at this stage of the evening? 
  He'd already had a go at Cleo about it. 
  You. 
  Alden told me about his plans for you two. 
  You little minx. 
  It's great news about the festival, isn't it? 
  And then, he had an even bigger go at me. 
  Walden's a traitorous b*st*rd. 
  (SLURPS) 
  You think you're so smart just like your mother. 
  Well your mother was a prossie. 
  A bus-down. 
  A doxy. 
  An easy-mac strumpet. 
  How did that make you feel? 
  Sad! 
  I felt sad, all right? 
  Wouldn't you? 
  Wouldn't you feel sad if your father spoke to you like that? 
  Thanks, Poppy. 
  You've been a great help. 
  (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
  Sims, you're needed out on Tanamoa Ridge. 
  (INQUISITIVE COUNTRY MUSIC) 
  I'd like to see your short films. 
  Why? 
  I mean, they're not for everyone.

  More cheese rolls? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Not quite. 
  (EERIE GUITAR MUSIC) 
  I was powerwalking along Old Comber Rise, not far from your place. 
  Right. 
  Then, at Pearse Point, there it was, lying in the grass. 
  I assume it belonged to one Lionel Bridges, given the wind direction the other night. 
  Thanks. 
  I'll pass that on to Gina. 
  Fair to say foul play was involved? 
  You know I can't talk about the case. 
  Oh, of course. 
  He was an interesting fellow. 
  You knew Lionel? 
  Oh, I tried not to. 
  I don't mean to speak ill of the dead, but if I were you, I'd have a word with Jared Morehu. 
  Ask him about model trains. 
  Right. 
  I'll come back for the, uh, Tupperware container. 
  If you wouldn't mind just giving it a rinse. 
  Oh! 
  Hello, Sam. 
  Mrs Marlowe. 
  Boss, I think I've got a pretty good idea where Alden Coombes might be. 
  Ooh!

  Mike, you're not going to believe this. 
  (SIREN WHOOPS IN DISTANCE) 
  No, I think I might. 
  (PHONE BEEPS) 
  Not exactly a high-speed getaway, is it? 
  Well, as they say, what goes up must come down. 
  So you should go in hot pursuit. 
  Good luck. 
  I need to get an ear to the mortuary. 
  Well, off you go! 
  Right. 
  Gidday, Mike. 
  No dog this time. 
  Uh, I put him somewhere safe. 
  She really likes you, eh? 
  Who? 
  Your mystery wahine. 
  You know, a woman doesn't lend her kuri just to any man. 
  Who says it's a woman? 
  Well, corgis are known for their vicious attack methods. 
  Women use them as undercover guard dogs. 
  You know, why do you think the Queen had so many? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I wanted to speak to you about model trains. 
  ls that a euphemism? 
  (SCOFFS) 
  You used to collect them. 
  Hell no. 
  I'm a man of many interests, Mike, but model trains don't do it for me. 
  But you knew Lionel Bridges? 
  Nah. 
  But I met him once. 
  'A few years ago, I was looking for a present for my nephew. 
  ' Um yeah. 
  So it's, uh, it's about this time the shop owner might say something like, 'How may I help you?' We're closed. 
  Well, you've go a funny way of showing it. 
  I doubt there's anything in here that would interest you lot. 
  Come on, Leon. 
  We'll go online and find some cool trains on there, eh? 
  (DOOR ALARM RINGS) 
  (TRAIN WHISTLE TOOTS) 
  Seems Lionel was most definitely racist. 
  All I know is my nephew has no interest in model trains any more. 
  I assume this is your mystery woman. 
  I'll leave you to it, eh? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I assure you it isn't. 
  Hey, a wink's as good as a nudge, Mike. 
  Ka kite! 
  I'm not winking. 
  (CAR DOOR OPENS) 
  Oh! 
  Detective. 
  Might I have a word? 
  Sure. 
  (CURIOUS GUITAR MUSIC) 
  Why is he flying so low? 
  Maybe his head injury's worse than we thought. 
  Or he's playing a long game. 
  Meaning? 
  Well, he could be angling to not stand trial on grounds of insanity. 
  Hey, did you ask Dr Carlton to have me around for dinner? 
  Still want to see you off the soups. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  I'm fine. 
  Really. 
  And so help me God, if Gina invites me around for borscht, I'm coming for you. 
  (ROLLICKING COUNTRY MUSIC) 
  Oh, that's a very striking perfume you wear. 
  Oh, thank you. 
  Would you like the name for Mrs Shepherd? 
  Uh, there is no Mrs Shepherd, and no. 
  I'm terrible at remembering that sort of thing. 
  Now, what brings you here? 
  Do you have any children, Detective? 
  No, I don't. 
  You'd make a wonderful father. 
  It wasn't to be. 
  I think it's very important to have a father figure in one's life, don't you? 
  A strong male role model. 
  Is that what Lionel was to Bart? 
  Oh, I encouraged it. 
  Raising Bart, I knew I was never going to be enough. 
  It's just that with Lionel gone, I'm worried that Bart is going to become withdrawn. 
  He's very shaken by what's happened, and of course, that reflects in his health with high blood pressure and water retention. 
  Elsa, I need to be clear that Bart remains a person that is helping us with our inquiries. 
  Of course. 
  No, no. 
  That's not what I meant. 
  I I wondered if you might take him fishing. 
  I'm sorry? 
  Or hunting, or something outdoors-y. 
  Something masculine. 
  I feel that you would be a really good influence. 
  I'm really not much of a fisherman. 
  Oh. 
  Well, it doesn't hurt to ask. 
  Thank you for the tea. 
  Elsa, I've been meaning to ask - how would you describe your steampunk character? 
  I don't have one. 
  So you weren't at Alden's party? 
  Why would I be at that silly affair? 
  Well, I was hoping you could tell me. 
  I saw your car parked near Alden's property. 
  I recognised the bumper sticker - 'Mothers know best. 
  ' Well, I'd probably just stopped somewhere to answer a call. 
  Mm. . 
  The car was empty. 
  Perhaps you're not remembering correctly. 
  I remember a red puffer jacket in the boot. 
  When I came by a second time after the explosion, the hatch was open and the jacket was gone. 
  What were you doing at Alden's property? 
  I had no interest in Alden Coombes' party or his type, and I don't like what you're implying. 
  Thank you again for the tea.

  Yeah, cos megaphones are notoriously quiet (!) 
  How about you come down and we have a chat? 
  How do I know you're alone?

  It's just us! 
  Will you guarantee my protection? 
  From who? 
  What are you afraid of?

  Bart, was your mother at Alden's place the other night? 
  My mum? 
  No way.

  Gina. 
  (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
  So satisfying when you have all the pieces of a puzzle, isn't it? 
  So, it definitely belonged to Lionel? 
  Yes. 
  Though, what's most interesting is this green hue around the top of the ear. 
  It's like fur. 
  Perhaps the fur of a Martian. 
  Interesting theory. 
  It's a joke, Mike. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I know Martians are not real. 
  Do you? 
  I'm not sure I do know they're not real. 
  I will look into it. 
  Whatever it is, it's not like any organic matter I've seen. 
  Perhaps the explosion had another chemical component. 
  You said they were trying to kill you, not Lionel. 
  Who are 'they'? 
  I should lie down. 
  Things are fuzzy. 
  Dr Carlton says you're fine. 
  Fine enough to leap out a window, steal a bicycle and fly a hot air balloon. 
  (NOTEBOOK THUDS) 
  So who are they? 
  Damn winds changed on me. 
  Otherwise, I'd have made it across the border into bright and wondrous lands. 
  New beginnings. 
  Alas, not to be. 
  Alden, if you believe that someone tried to kill you and killed Lionel instead, it is imperative you tell us. 
  In a way, I killed him. 
  See, Lionel's death was all my doing. 
  I lost my wife 10 years ago - a virus out of the blue, no warning. 
  I'm sorry to hear that. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Things went downhill for a while. 
  There was some drinking, gambling. 
  Grief, you see, can turn some of us upside down. 
  Things unravelled on me financially. 
  The banks got tired of me. 
  How does this explain what happened to Lionel? 
  Hot air ballooning is a fickle business, at the mercy of the weather gods. 
  And, even then, if you can't buy gas, you can't get yourself aloft. 
  So, I borrowed money from some Well, wherever I could. 
  So, you're in trouble with loan sharks? 
  Scoundrels, yes. 
  Threats were made - serious threats. 
  So when I woke up in hospital and heard what had happened, I knew. 
  I knew it was meant for me. 
  Do you have a name for this lender? 
  If I were to tell you that, I'd be re-signing my death warrant. 
  Or saving another innocent life.

  Nobody else can account for you. 
  I can't remember. 
  I I'm trying to remember. 
  Perhaps a good night's sleep might help me recover my scrambled thoughts. 
  Can I be emancipated, so that I might repose? 
  Please don't try and leave town while we follow this up.

  Well, if it's good enough for Alden Coombes. 
  Mm. . 
  Think of the psychological issues he has now - abandonment, persecution, not to mention distrust of the police. 
  Elsa Bloom was near the scene of the crime. 
  I recognised her car yesterday, but she won't admit it. 
  Best case - she was spying on her son. 
  Worst case - she was there to deal to Lionel. 
  Bart is very much under the thumb of his mother. 
  Possibly covering for her too? 
  Apart from her, he leads a very solitary life, spending most of his time online. 
  He was on one of those, urn, chat rooms when I dropped by. 
  He closed it quickly. 
  Oh, yeah? 
  What's it called? 
  In-Life.

  Well, incels are a community of lonely, young, mostly white virgins who feel resentment at their perceived rejections by women. 
  It's a special kind of boys' club. 
  Cleo did say that Poppy had rejected Ban at a party once. 
  Oh. 
  No wonder he got on so well with Lionel. 
  Breen, I want you to watch the movies that Poppy and Cleo have been making. 
  I've forwarded you the link. 
  Are you sure this is a great use of police time? 
  I don't think they'll be very good.

  (COMPUTER BEEPS) 
  He changed his name and emigrated 10 years ago, when his wife died. 
  Yeah, from a virus, I believe. 
  Well, she may have had a virus when she fell from the basket of his hot air balloon.

  Not pretty. 
  OK. 
  Thanks.

  It affected her balance. 
  She leaned over. 
  I was acquitted. 
  Flying balloons is everything to me - everything. 
  Why should I lose that because of an accident? 
  A tragic accident. 
  A witness has you and Lionel having a heated argument out by the Portaloos about 20 minutes before the explosion. 
  What was that about? 
  (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) 
  OK. 
  Here's how it looks. 
  You had an argument with Lionel. 
  Then, while everyone is inside, enjoying the band, you have time to unlock your shed - you said yourself, you have the only key - hook a propane tank up to a Portaloo, fill it with gas, and then wait for Lionel to come along. 
  You then locked the Portaloos after he went inside, planning to gas him to death, but you didn't count on him trying to have a cigarette. 
  The Portaloo explodes, killing Lionel and landing you in hospital with enough injuries to make you look like an innocent bystander. 
  You can see why it's in your best interest to clarify what went on and why. 
  I swear it was nothing like that. 
  Yes, we did argue bitterly. 
  After the announcement Lionel? 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  You should know I've asked Poppy and Cleo to help me run the festival. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  The hell you have. 
  I'm sorry. 
  You know I need this festival. 
  I did all the budgets, proposals, the logistics. 
  I set up all the meetings.

  We need fresh blood! 
  All this horrible stuff you keep saying will kill our plans.

  He flicked his cigarette away and stormed off. 
  Yes. 
  In that moment, I wanted to kill him, but I didn't. 
  After he mentioned your wife? 
  Lionel knew about the accident. 
  What did Lionel know? 
  Oh, if other people found out, it'd all be over. 
  And that was the last time you saw him'? 
  No.

  Does it belong to you? 
  This padlock - do you recognise it? 
  Maybe. 
  (LOCK CLICKS) 
  So? 
  It's from my shed. 
  Well, it was found on the field behind your house. 
  The shank's been cut through. 
  Obviously, you see, a burglar. 
  That wasn't the one found on your shed. 
  This padlock was. 
  Urn Sorry, I'm confused. 
  Well, let me keep it simple. 
  Did you cut the shank off your own padlock and then place a new padlock on? 
  Why would I cut my own padlock? 
  Well, that's what I was hoping you could tell me, to eliminate any confusion. 
  W-W-Wait. 
  Were my fingerprints on the new padlock? 
  They weren't. 
  Well, there you go. 
  But you did say you always wore gloves. 
  (EERIE MUSIC) 
  He was found closest to the blast. 
  It was his gas that was used. 
  He had motive in wanting to stop Lionel before he wrecked his plans. 
  And he was the last to see Lionel alive. 
  But how did he know when Lionel would use the toilet, or if he would use it at all? 
  (KNOCKING) 
  Finished watching Poppy Bridges' masterpieces. 
  They're not bad, actually, but the latest one - Divine Beings, the one they were doing reshoots for when I made my cameo - well, it turns out the original version had been online for months and was taken down the day after Lionel was killed.

  Oh. 
  Off the record, as an uncle, not a pharmacist. 
  Mm. 
  Mm-hm. 
  Well, he suffered pneumonia as a child. 
  Since then, he's sort of struggled with various ailments - asthma, volatile blood sugar, high blood pressure, for which he takes a diuretic. 
  Mind you, if Elsa was my mother, I'd probably suffer high blood pressure too. 
  Poor kid. 
  Sometimes, he's got so many pills on him, he sounds like a maraca. 
  To clarify, Bart is actually unwell? 
  Yes and no? 
  Everything he takes is preventative. 
  He hasn't had any proper medical scares for a long time. 
  In my opinion, that boy's biggest health concern WHISPERS: is my sister-in-law.

  The original ending of your film, Divine Beings, depicts a villainous train conductor being killed by your character. 
  It's undoubtedly supposed to be Lionel, isn't it? 
  Divine Beings, Heavenly Creatures. 
  It was a homage. 
  To a film about two young women killing one of their mothers with a brick to the head? 
  Curiously, the film was taken down the day after Lionel Bridges was murdered. 
  You then went out and shot an alternative ending the next day. 
  Correct? 
  Yes. 
  And why would you do that? 
  I felt ashamed. 
  I knew it would look insensitive, even though It was a joke. 
  Poppy and I used to talk about killing off Lionel's steampunk character, but only his character, not him. 
  We were roleplaying. 
  It was a silly game. 
  It wasn't real. 
  Until, suddenly, it was real. 
  SIMS: Poppy's father really is dead. 
  The man who stood in the way of you two being happy together. 
  He dies. 
  The next day, you move in, into his house.

  Poppy and I have broken up. 
  Why would we do something like that just to break up? 
  Maybe you couldn't handle the guilt. 
  I didn't do it. 
  What about Poppy? 
  With your father dead, you stand to inherit his house, his business, which you could run, or sell.

  Ah, it's a wonder this guy can keep this thing on his head. 
  (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
  Thank you both for coming back in. 
  I just have one question. 
  Whose hat is this? 
  It's mine. 
  So you were wearing it? 
  No. 
  I was. 
  Poppy gave it to me as a symbol of our commitment. 
  Where did you find it'? 
  (PHONE BEEPS) 
  OK. 
  Got it. 
  Thanks, Sims. 
  (PHONE BEEPS) 
  You're in a new spot? 
  Yeah, all thanks to Tim Werner. 
  Tried to rent me a Timmie Time Toilet Tank, you know, on the idea that sometimes, when people have a coffee, it makes them want to, you know, go. 
  So, rather than go to go, I offer facilities. 
  It makes a lot of sense. 
  But why pay Timmie Time when I can get it for free, huh? 
  (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) 
  (DIAL TONE) 
  Sims, we've been looking at this the wrong way around. 
  Lionel Bridges wasn't the target. 
  Cleo, you mentioned to Detective Sims that on the night Lionel was killed, you wet yourself. 
  Oh my God. 
  I can't believe you wrote that down. 
  You said it was because of the shock of the explosion? 
  Yeah. 
  Has anything like this ever happened to you before? 
  No. 
  Never. 
  Well, how much had you had to drink? 
  Only a couple of beers. 
  I was playing in the band. 
  Why? 
  Are you sure it was after the explosion? 
  (FIREWORKS EXPLODE, CRACKLE) 
  (CROWD CHEERS, LAUGHS) 
  (WATER TRICKLES) 
  (GASPS) 
  Oh my God. 
  Don't look at me! 
  - (BOOM!) 
  - (CROWD SCREAMS) 
  No. 
  Actually, it was just before. 
  So embarrassing. 
  Thank you for your time, Cleo. 
  SIMS: You're both free to go. 
  Can I give either of you a ride home'? 
  I'll walk. 
  You go with her. 
  No. 
  Um, you take the car. 
  I'll walk. 
  I don't mind. 
  Um can I just say, off the record - you two have been through a lot, and you both really seem to care about each other. 
  I know you're young, but believe me, it's actually a really rare thing, so just don't be so quick to throw it away. 
  Um, we could both walk. 
  OK. 
  (GENTLE COUNTRY MUSIC) 
  (SHUDDERS) 
  You think it's safe out there? 
  Yes, Alden. 
  I do. 
  (SCANNER BEEP-S) 
  You're free to go. 
  Oh. 
  Thank you for your understanding. 
  Mm-hm. 
  Oh. 
  Um If you ever fancy a balloon ride, it really is a whole other world up there.

  (TRAIN WHISTLE TOOTS) 
  Detective. 
  Can I help you? 
  Like you said the other day about always being able to find something new. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  It's very true. 
  No, don't do that! 
  I know. 
  I know. 
  My doctor said I need to go easy on the salt. 
  But it isn't salt, is it? 
  I think you better come down to the station. 
  Uh why? 
  To answer a few more questions. 
  (DOOR ALARM RINGS) 
  What if I don't want to? 
  Then I could arrest you. 
  For what? 
  The murder of Lionel Bridges. 
  No, I didn't murder him. 
  Then you won't mind answering those questions. 
  Send in forensics. 
  (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) 
  (SCANNER BEEPS) 
  (DOOR SQUEAKS) 
  (DRAMATIC MUSIC) 
  You cared deeply for Lionel. 
  Everyone knew that. 
  The idea that you would want to hurt him is absurd. 
  Yeah. 
  That's right. 
  Absolutely right. 
  Mm, though what was less known was your intense infatuation with Poppy Bridges. 
  Nobody knew about it because you kept it very private. 
  She had rejected you at a party years ago. 
  To her, it was nothing more than an awkward interaction long-forgotten. 
  But to you, it was devastating, wasn't it? 
  You found comfort in the world of incel chat rooms, where other lonely men vented about all the women who'd wronged them. 
  But your crush on Poppy never went away. 
  Hence, you jumped at the chance to edit her steampunk videos for free. 
  It meant you could be close to her in a unique way. 
  But Lionel had nothing but hatred for women. 
  In his mind, women were the cause of much of the suffering in his world. 
  When after I gave up my life to raise her, she decides she's gonna bring home 'So you came up with a plan to impress him. 
  ' Girl? 
  Oh, no, no, no. 
  Two birds with one stone. 
  Kill Poppy's new girlfriend by locking her in the female Portaloo and pumping it full of gas, making sure it looked like Alden Coombes was responsible (LOCK CLATTERS) 
  either deliberately or through negligence. 
  (EERIE MUSIC) 
  In your mind, with one fell swoop (GIGGLES) 
  both you and Lionel would be rid of all the troubles in your lives. 
  And who knows? 
  I mean, with Cleo gone, maybe Poppy would see you in a different light. 
  (SCANNER BEEPS, DOOR OPENS) 
  (DOOR SHUTS) 
  BREEN: This fob watch was found attached to your steampunk costume containing traces of the salt from the salt mine, which is in fact crushed furosemide - a diuretic. 
  Extreme high doses can take effect quickly, causing bladder spasms. 
  The same drug you take or don't take. 
  (DRAMATIC MUSIC) 
  I imagine not taking your medicine is one of the few ways you have of rebelling against your overbearing mother. 
  (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) 
  (DRINK FIZZES) 
  Lionel! 
  I got you a Oh, you've already got one. 
  One going spare? 
  That's kind. 
  Thanks, Bart. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Cleo thought you were trying to be nice, making an effort. 
  To sexy hats! 
  To sexy hats. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  And you were - to kill her. 
  I'll get more. 
  You knew it would only be a matter of minutes before Cleo desperately needed to relieve herself, so you went outside and waited by the women's Portaloo. 
  (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
  But Lionel had caught a really unlucky break. 
  LIONEL: You should take that off. 
  (PAIR KISS) 
  POPPY: And I really want you to be happy for me. 
  Funny. 
  All I really want is a piss and a durry. 
  If he'd used the male Portaloo, we wouldn't be sitting here. 
  (SIGHS) 
  But, again, bad luck. 
  (TENSE MUSIC) 
  (WHINES) 
  You!

  (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC BUILDS) 
  (LIGHTER CLICKS) 
  (BOOM!) 
  (PANTS) 
  It was only meant as a joke. 
  She would have smelled the gas and come out and laughed, maybe. 
  But ifs not murder, is it? 
  I mean, if I didn't mean it. 
  (GASPS) 
  (PANTS) 
  C-Can I see my mum? 
  (GLOOMY COUNTRY MUSIC) 
  # I blame your mother for every little thing. 
  # When the cows don't come home, # when the birds, they don't sing. 
  (SLAM! 
 ) 
  # I blame your mother for every little thing. 
  # When the cows don't come home, when the birds, they don't sing. 
  So, are you gonna tell us who this mystery lady is? 
  I, uh, don't see the need. 
  Oh, go on! 
  (COLLAR JANGLES) 
  (WILLIE PANTS) 
  He's Willie, as in 'Willie Nelson'. 
  Aha. 
  Country music fan. 
  No. 
  A librarian? 
  No. 
  Petra Conway. 
  Who's Petra Conway? 
  My ex-wife. 
  Goodnight! 
  W-wait! 
  Which one? 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  That doesn't really narrow it down. 
  Oi! 
  (DOOR SHUTS) 
  # He was a friend of mine. 
  (CAR DOOR OPENS) 
  Hi! 
  Petra! 
  How was the festival? 
  Incredible. 
  A week of sun, country music, wine, tepees. 
  You should have come. 
  Yeah. 
  It was a little bit short notice. 
  My little Willie! 
  Hm. 
  (WILLIE BARKS SOFTLY) 
  He didn't get in the way? 
  Oh, mm. 
  You've got a red open. 
  I do! 
  Would you like to come in? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Yep. 
  (WILLIE WHINES) 
  Come on. 
  He was a friend of mine.
