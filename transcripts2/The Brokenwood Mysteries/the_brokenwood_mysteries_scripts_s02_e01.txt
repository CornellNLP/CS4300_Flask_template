 Come on! Leave me alone, you freak! 
 Go away, or I'll call the cops! 
 (LOUD SCREAM) 
 ♪ And I made a promise that I would share out my dollars... ♪ 
 Nothing like a 3km run to sort the hangover. 
 Speak for yourself. I'm mashed. 
 That's why I gave up Sunday drinks. 
 Whoa! 
 Whoa! Whoa! It's bloody Arnie. 
 Breen's team, huh? 
 Mm-hm. The infamous Brokenwood Cheetahs. 
 Infamous because? 
 They're truly dreadful. 
 Is that why they're forced to cheat? 
 'Cheetahs' as in the animals. 
 Ah. The dead guy's their coach? 
 Mm-hm. Arnie Langstone. 53, aside from coaching he's involved in Rotary, business Round Tables, breakfast clubs for kids, the fun run. 
 One of the good guys. Yeah. Everyone loved Arnie. 
 Perhaps not everyone. 
 Is that coffee? 
 Yeah. You want some? 
 Did you make it? 
 I made a pot at the station when the call came through. 
 Ah. No, I'm good. 
 Footprints? Really? 
 You never know. 
 Two social rugby teams as well as the Cheetahs use this ground. 
 Don't they say that every boot print paints a thousand words? 
 No. 
 Don't worry, Arnie, we'll get you out of here very soon into a more dignified position. 
 You knew them, didn't you? 
 He knew his killer. 
 And you know this how? 
 'Cause he's staring at them. 
 The retina of the eye acts like a camera. 
 The last image they see is imprinted on the eye. 
 Are you serious? 
 No. But I've always thought, if it did happen, it would make our job a hell of a lot easier. 
 Are you OK? 
 Not my ideal way of mixing business with pleasure but, hey. 
 Bag that. 
 I'll start with interviewing the lads. 
 Hey, er, best you sit this one out. 
 What? 
 Ah, right now there are fifteen suspects. 
 You're joking. 
 Get home, take a shower. We'll be around later for a witness statement. 
 You're standing me down? 
 No.Come on, don't stand me down. How would it look? 
 Which is why I'm not standing you down. You have leave owing, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm making you take that leave. 
 Right. 
 Breen, did Arnie have family? Wife, kids? 
 Oh, now you want me. Separated. 
 Barbara Langstone, Connemara Drive. 9, I think. No kids that I know of. 
 Barbara Langstone? 
 Yes. 
 DSS Mike Shepherd, Brokenwood CIB. 
 Yes. 
 Have you got a moment? 
 Sorry, no, I'm running late for an appointment. 
 A quiet word. It's important. Really, look, if I miss this appointment it'll take weeks to get another. 
 Arnie Langstone is your ex-husband? 
 Yes. 
 I'm afraid he's been found dead. At the rugby ground. 
 Oh. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Would you like to sit down inside? Is there someone I can call for you? 
 No, that's OK. How did he... 
 There'll be a post-mortem but it would appear he's been the victim of foul play. 
 God. Poor Arnie. Is there anything I need to do? 
 Well, I'd appreciate a chat about Arnie, his background, friends, associates. 
 Perhaps later. This appointment's in Riverstone. 
 The sooner the better, if that's OK. 
 Yep. Of course. I've gotta go. Sorry. Thank you for letting me know. 
 There's bruising about the head and abdomen. 
 I'd say he was attacked, probably punched. 
 Fatal blows? 
 No. They didn't kill him. There are also traces of lipstick about his mouth. Transferred, I think. 
 So he was lucky before he got unlucky? 
 Perhaps he lit a cigarette from a candle. 
 He was a smoker? 
 Not that I can tell. But in Russia, if you light a cigarette from a candle, it is very bad luck. 
 He's not Russian. 
 Then, for the most part, he was lucky until this. 
 Time of death? 
 Between 11pm and 1am. 
 And the cause? 
 Setting aside candles, cigarettes and bad luck. 
 Suffocation. 
 From having this taped down on his face? 
 No. The ball did not make Something lacy and black did. 
 Talk about biting off more than you can chew. 
 There is no sign of chewing. They were forced down his trachea. 
 I'll come back later. 
 No. Come in. 
 That looks intriguing. 
 The murder weapon. 
 They were jammed down Arnie's throat. 
 Mm. OK. That's intriguing and also a little bit icky. 
 Mm. 
 Are they ripped? 
 Yes. As you say, intriguing. 
 Rugby's a rough game. 
 Beaten and choked. 
 Yes. And put on display. 
 Anything from the players? 
 Not a lot. 
 Arnie trained us really hard. But he was always up for a beer and a laugh. 
 Rubbish coach but nice enough guy. 
 Worst coach but the best at the same time. 
 Feels kind of weird talking about him in the past tense. 
 And such a now guy, eh? 
 Would you like a moment? 
 You know how some people sponsor a child in Africa? 
 Arnie had three. 
 Who'd want to do that to Arnie? 
 That's what I'm asking. Did Arnie have any enemies? 
 Anyone with a grudge? 
 No. Got nothing. 
 No. 
 So, fairly unanimous love and undying loyalty. 
 Why have you written 'such a loser' on Gazza's statement? 
 Did I? 'Cause I thought it, I didn't actually realise I'd written it down. 
 Sorry, it's nothing, it's not relevant to the case. 
 Oh, look, it's... When I first moved to Brokenwood I went on a few dates and Gazza - Gareth - was one of them. 
 Romance blossomed? 
 Not so much. Hi, Gazza. 
 Oh, god! What is that smell? 
 That window doesn't work. 
 First date? 
 And last. 
 Why are there only 13 of them? 
 Well, Breen, obviously, and Steve Fanshaw, their number five and landscaper. 
 The only player not to show up on the day that their coach is murdered? 
 Indeed. 
 Hey, take a look at this. 
 GG. 
 That a brand you all wear? 
 That's not the brand, they are initials but, whoever GG is, they didn't skimp on quality. Demi Prive? 
 The Rolls Royce of women's lingerie. 
 Interesting. 
 Sorry, after however many ex-wives, did you never buy a pair of... 
 GG? Anyone spring to mind? 
 Governor Grey. 
 New Zealand's first premier? 
 Unlikely. 
 I'll do a name check. 
 Do that. 
 Because... that is the last thing on Arnie's phone. 
 From a prepay? 
 Non-traceable. 
 OK, I'm thinking no to Governor Grey? 
 And, whoever GG is, seems like she's missing her underwear. 
 Hey. 
 Busy, I see. 
 I'd rather be at work. 
 We need a statement. Are you serious? 
 Roxy's. She uses it for fitness. 
 Fitness? 
 She's in the fitness industry. You're welcome to try it. 
 No. I'm good. 
 So, what time did you get to the rugby ground? 
 6:30am. We always do an early Monday session. 
 Gets you warmed up for the working week. 
 Arnie's car was here when we arrived. 
 It's not like Arnie to be late. 
 His car's out the front. Can't be far away. 
 Maybe he slept in. 
 Maybe he got lucky last night! 
 Why would Davo think that Arnie got lucky? 
 Just locker room banter, I guess. Let's do our 3km while we wait. 
 Bugger off! 
 Can't hurt. 
 Hasn't helped until now. 
 50 straight losses, Breeno. 
 Gotta be some kind of world record. 
 Eh, Arnie's our coach. Respect. 
 Remember what Arnie says, "Winning is easy. 
 "It's how you lose makes you real winners." 
 Yeah, I don't think that's quite accurate. 
 Fair cool, sticking up for Arnie, back there. 
 Still a lousy bloody coach. 
 When we got back from the run, that's when we found him. 
 How would you describe him as a coach? 
 Traditional. 
 Aggressive? 
 Hell, no. He'd no time for that. Had a zero tolerance policy towards aggro. 
 Aggression-free rugby! Novel. 
 Arnie's mantra was, "Violence has no place on the rugby field." 
 This is finally getting interesting. Cheese roll? 
 Oh, yeah, please. 
 This is the real reason I come to the game, Mrs M! 
 ♪ Come on, you Cheetahs! ♪ 
 Arnie chose to field 14 men on Saturday, rather than condone Steve's actions from the week before. 
 How did the team feel about that? 
 We all knew Arnie's rules. 
 So Steve Fanshaw was a hothead, then? 
 Well, he's got a short fuse. But Arnie was helping him with that. 
 By standing him down? 
 Tough love, I guess. You know, I could be more help to you on the case. 
 You've been helpful. 
 So when can I come back to work? Come on. 
 I don't want to be on leave. 
 We can't have the public crying 'cover ups' and all that sort of carry on. 
 Yeah. Yeah. I know. It's just, the longer I stick around here, Roxy's gonna find me stuff to do around the house. 
 Which would eat into X-box time. 
 I need to find solace somehow. 
 One last question. Do the initials GG mean anything? 
 Governor Grey? 
 That's what I said! 
 ♪ Hey, mama, don't cry ♪ 
♪ Hey, mama, don't cry. ♪ 
 You know, it's one thing to kill a man, but to strip him naked, tape a rugby ball over his face and ram some knickers down his throat, that's more than just murder. 
 It is, indeed, a statement. 
 So, is GG the initials of a jilted lover? 
 Or the wife of a man that caught Arnie with his hand in the cookie jar? 
 ♪ Hey, daddy, don't weep. ♪ 
 Hello, again. 
 Barbara. This is Detective Sims. 
 Hello. 
 I'm really sorry about your ex-husband. 
 Thank you. About before. I think I was in shock. 
 I understand. 
 Did you make your appointment? 
 What? 
 In Riverside. 
 Oh, yes. Yes, I did. Sorry. It's the news about Arnie. 
 I'm still trying to take it in. Would you like to come inside? 
 Um, that's OK. We can talk here. Cute house. 
 So you and Arnie were separated for three years? 
 Four. 
 Do you mind me asking the reasons for the split? 
 Just drifted apart. 
 Yeah, that happens. 
 You've been there? 
 I'm something of an expert. 
 Separation was the logical step. No kids involved, wasn't that messy. 
 That was a mutual decision? 
 It was. I mean, why live with someone who wasn't present? 
 Four years but no divorce? 
 No. 
 You said, "Not present." Where was Arnie? 
 The Arnie I married used to be a very aggressive rugby coach. 
 He'd push his players to be hard men on his field. 
 Brutal in pursuit of victory. Then, about ten years ago, during a game... ..opposing player died right there on the field. Arnie blamed himself, coaching style... 
 But he didn't give up on the game? 
 I think he felt redemption could only come from changing the culture from within. 
 So Arnie changed, and that's why you split? 
 He retreated. 
 Into himself? 
 Via his shed. Look, I'll show you. 
 This is where Arnie spent a lot of time. 
 What was his beer like? 
 I don't drink beer. 
 But he must have been proud of his first brew, surely? 
 Did he wax lyrical about its hoppy taste? 
 I don't remember. Like I said, I don't drink beer. 
 What else did he do in here? 
 I've no idea. Oh, he made a keyring hanger once, by the back door. Arnie's handiwork. I'd like to say he was a better rugby coach but, as you know, his record was dire. 
 He left his tools behind? 
 You mean, was there a screaming row and I threw him out? 
 OK. Did he leave in a hurry? 
 Like I said, we just drifted apart. 
 So that was four years ago. Have you moved on? 
 Sorry? 
 Are you seeing anyone? 
 I'm OK with being single. 
 And what about Arnie? Was he seeing anyone? 
 Not that I know of. 
 Oh, one last question. It's just a formality, really, but, um... do you know if Arnie had life insurance? 
 I've no idea. 
 Being single isn't the same as not seeing someone. 
 Yeah, not seeing someone is all well and good, but some bloke is keeping their rugby boots by her front door. 
 Perhaps they're hers? 
 Fair point.

 Beer. Lipstick. 
 Arnie loved his music. 
 Never understood the appeal of classical music. 
 Not enough jangling guitars and lyrics about losing your dog down a coalmine for you? 
 Oh, come on, you know you love it. 
 You know I don't! 
 Still young. 
 He loved his rugby. 
 Never properly unpacked. 
 Maybe he was hoping he and Barbara would reconcile? 
 Hey, take a look at this. Two toothbrushes. 
 Arnie wasn't a bachelor, after all. 
 And whoever she was, she left in a hurry. 
 Any luck? 
 No-one on that side remembers Arnie having a live-in lover, flatmate or his girlfriend. 
 Likewise. And those two, neither are home. 
 Maybe she'll come back.

 Missing person report. 
 Dana Clark, 19. 
 Came to Brokenwood from Riverstone on Sunday night and never came home. 
 I'll take a look at that, shall I? 
 Mm-hm. 
 See if there's a connection. Hey, and women in the area with the initials GG, Gillian Green, 35... 
 She missing a red dress? 
 Unlikely, she's in a coma and has been in a special care facility for two years. Gemma Gordon, Georgia Gascoigne and Grace Godber are 11, 9 and 7-years-old respectively. 
 Gwynedd Griffiths... 
 Gwynedd? Is that a real name? 
 Mm. Welsh, I think. 
 Because? 
 Griffiths? Plus she moved back to Wales three months ago. 
 Did she take all her underwear? 
 That's a rhetorical question, right? Glenda Gladwell is 93 and in a rest home. I had a follow up with Steve Fanshaw, the missing Cheetah. You OK? 
 Yeah. Old friend. 
 Bit far out for noise control, isn't it? 
 I'm here about Arnie - Detective Simms. 
 Do you want to sit down somewhere, or... 
 No. I'm in a bit of a hurry. Is this going to take long? 
 Because you weren't working yesterday? 
 I had to go over to Riverstone yesterday. 
 Is that why you weren't at practice yesterday morning? 
 Arnie stood me down for the game on Saturday. 
 I wasn't in the mood for practice. 
 How did you feel about being stood down? 
 I was a dick. Probably cost us the game. 
 Were you upset with Arnie? 
 He's the coach. 
 Even if he was a useless one. 
 You said it, not me. 
 What? And you never have? 
 In jest. We used to give Arnie a hard time. 
 50 straight losses isn't exactly a mark of excellence, is it? 
 That must be frustrating for you. 
 Yeah. Could be. 
 You've had problems with violence in the past, haven't you, Steve? 
 Ah, yeah. That's your angle, is it? 
 Didn't you once threaten to kill Arnie? 
 It was a long time ago. We were all going through a rough time. Then Arnie got me enrolled on some anger management classes, and it helped. I'm different now. 
 What about your meltdown in the game last week? 
 First one in ages. And Arnie was right to give me some time out. Arnie's coaching didn't make for great rugby, but it made for better players. 
 And your movements Sunday night? 
 I was hanging at home. Then I went to the Frog and Cheetah for a beer, then I went home again. Ray Nielsen was serving, he'll tell you I was there. 
 And home is? 
 29 Bush Mill Terrace. I flat with Dave and Gazza from the team. I didn't hurt Arnie. 
 Thanks for your help. 
 Yeah, yeah. Steve was in here. 
 Any others from the team? 
 They all were. I give them cheap drinks on game night if they show up in their jerseys. Of course they all turn in their jerseys, the cheap bastards. Best and worst thing I ever did, sponsoring that damn team. On the one hand I get all the lads in here, spending up large. On the other hand, I've got my pub's name on the most shite local team in the country. 
 Don't they say there's no such thing as bad publicity?Yeah. But I mean, being associated with a pack of losers for five years? It's not a good look for this place. See, the Frog and Cheetah is an aspirational bar. People come here to feel good about themselves. Isn't that right, Len? 
 What? 
 This place. Where dreams come true. 
 Oh. Yep. 
 Len's a house painter. You know what they say? 
 Fast hands, slow mind. Not to speak ill of the dead, but maybe now that Arnie's gone, they might start winning games again. 
 You think it was down to the coaching, then? 
 What do you think? 
 I'm asking you. 
 He was too soft on them. Lacked the killer instinct. 
 Yeah, there was a reason for that. 
 Yeah, yeah. The fine line between assertion and aggression. 
 He went all namby-pamby on them when he should've been kicking their butts. 
 You were here all night? 
 Yep. 
 What about the other players? 
 Do you know what time they left? 
 No. 
 No idea? 
 Mate, I run a busy pub. Like, I can't be holding their hands. They come, they go. Hey, Len! Were you in here on Sunday night when Steve and the boys were drinking? 
 Yep. 
 When did you leave? 
 Same time I always do. When you kicked me out! 
 Talk to Len. 
 Len, is it? 
 DSS Mike Shepherd. 
 I'm making enquiries about Arnie Langstone. 
 Yeah, I overheard. Bloody sad. 
 Can you remember if Steve Fanshaw was in here on Sunday night? 
 Yeah. Him and the others. No different from any other Sunday. 
 Team lost. Drank here. Went home. 
 You don't play yourself? 
 No. My brother used to play, but I never had the speed. 
 Just a loyal fan, then? 
 Well, you know, there's always Mrs Marlowe's cheese rolls. 
 (MOBILE RINGING) 
 Oh. Excuse me. 
 What have you got? 
 We've located Dana Clark's car. About 5km out of town on the Riverstone road. 
 Locked? 
 Bet you $10 she ran out of gas. 
 Based on? 
 The bonnet's not up. 
 My ex-wife never checked the fuel gauge. 
 Swear she thought the 'E' stood for extra full. 
 This was ex-wife number... 
 So, if she's headed out of town, back to Riverstone... she runs out of gas... or breaks down. 
 ..decides to hitch. 
 Sims! 
 Gibbs! Gibbs. 
 Mike! Maybe she was disorientated? 
 I admire your optimism. 
 If she was, she was in a hell of a hurry. 
 Sims. 
 Gibbs! Take upstream. 
 Hey. There's a wallet in that handbag. 
 Dana's ID's in there. If she had followed this, she would've made it back to town. 
 Eventually. 
 Or not. 
 Hey, Dana. 
 We found you. 
 Dana's wallet still had cash inside it. 
 And her car keys were there. 
 Look at this. 
 She's in bare feet at this stage, right? 
 As she slid, she's pushed the earth aside, this way. 
 Feet are smooth, right? 
 Yeah. 
 But...the other person follows a different line. 
 It's like they clawed the ground. 
 Or they were wearing... Unusual shoes. 
 OK. Everyone stand still. 
 Please do not move until I say so. 
 Mike! Got it. 
 Over here. We need a cast taken. 
 I can put the time of death between 11pm and 1am, Sunday night. 
 Same time as Arnie Langstone. 
 Coincidence? I don't know. 
 Cause of death is strangulation. 
 Whereas Arnie was suffocation. 
 Yes. This girl was strangled by hands. 
 You can see the bruising around here and here. 
 Big hands? 
 Are we talking male hands? 
 Not necessarily. In Russia some of the woman's hands are very big. 
 Quite scary, actually. 
 You should never apply for a job in Russian tourism. 
 Why would I do that? I'm a doctor. 
 There are several 4cm indentations on her head. 
 She was struck with something blunt. 
 A rock, perhaps? 
 The marks are not severe enough to be from something that hard. 
 Anything else? 
 Her underwear is on. 
 So we can assume that the underwear that killed Arnie wasn't hers? 
 But also, there is no sign of sexual interference. 
 How d'you get on with Dana's parents? 
 Does it ever get any easier? 
 No. 
 I did have a thought on the way over. 
 Something was missing from that handbag. 
 One thing no woman would go without. 
 Lipstick? 
 How does she make calls? Take selfies, update Facebook, check Twitter, Instagram her food? 
 You lost me after 'make calls'. 
 Her parents confirmed she has one, so where is it? 
 Plus, it gets better. Her sister said that Dana had been dabbling with hook-up sites. She'd come to Brokenwood for a good time. 
 Which turned out to be a bad time. 
 I'll get the SSG to do a wider search. 
 Definitely. 
 I've got a serving, a DC Breen, he's part of the local rugby team. 
 His coach has been murdered. 
 When will police officers realise they're not supposed to have social lives? 
 Yeah, too late in this case. 
 You stood him down? 
 Put him on leave. 
 Smart. You need another team? 
 I just need Breen back. 
 We've got a double feature up here. 
 Should I send Wilmott up to calm the PR waters for this Spring? 
 Breen, and not Wilmott, please. 
 I'm winding you up. She's on holiday in Fiji. 
 With her new man. How d'you feel about that? 
 Do I have to feel anything? 
 Try. 
 Relieved. 
 I see why she left you. 
 I think I left her. 
 You can't leave someone if you were never there. 
 Listen, I may have a more efficient way to ameliorate this issue and kick it into touch... So to speak. 
 Tell me you want me back at work. 
 Wanting you back and letting you back are different things. 
 Come on. Roxy's got me painting the spare room. 
 Baby blue? Is she... 
 No, she's not. Although she's showing signs of wanting to go that way. 
 And these signs are? 
 Can we just pretend that I'm at work? I hate painting. 
 I'm working on it. 
 Would you like a coffee, boss? 
 How did you make this? 
 With a plunger. 
 It's really good. 
 It's just plunger. 
 What sort of beans are they? 
 Coffee. Just add hot water, milk. It's not rocket science. 
 The family of the player who died in the on-field fight, would they have had cause to come up for Arnie? 
 I was still in Riverstone then. Why would they blame Arnie? 
 He was the coach of the player that killed their son. 
 No. They'd blame the player. Everyone blamed the player. 
 He cocked up. 
 I can't find a record of his name anywhere. 
 He got a name suppression. He was really a contender to go on to be a pro. So the lawyers argued to keep his name out of the papers. 
 Did he end up going pro? 
 No. 
 How come? 
 Topped himself. Few years later. 
 How? 
 Hung himself. Rumour is, from the goalposts. 
 The club keeps it on the down-low, they don't want the younger players to know. 
 North end or south? 
 Oh. Dunno. It's just a rumour. But do you think it could've been the same end as where we found Arnie? 
 Is there something in that? 
 Could just be a macabre coincidence. 
 So, if no-one talks about it, how come you know about it? 
 Come on, people know stuff, they just choose not to share it. 
 Though Arnie did open up once, after he tied on a few. 
 Never get over something like that. You know I was the one that found him? Strung up. 
 You've gotta leave that in the past, though, right? 
 It haunts me. You ever been haunted, Sammy? 
 Can't say that I have. 
 It's always there. Ghosts. 
 On the sideline. 
 What was the player's name? 
 Brody Carson. 
 Related to Len Carson? 
 Yeah. You gotta hand it to that guy. 
 He really stuck with the team. 
 That's a certain kind of loyalty. 
 Misguided? 
 Calling us losers? 
 Is there a more accurate term? 
 You can't call us losers, just 'cause we haven't won. 
 Oh. You should get a t-shirt with that on. 
 G'day, Len. 
 G'day. 
 You mentioned your brother used to play rugby? 
 Yeah. What about him? 
 I understand he took his own life after killing an opposing player? 
 People don't talk about that. 
 Yeah. Must've been a tough time. 
 It was a game that Arnie was coaching? 
 I think it was. Yeah. 
 So someone might blame him? 
 Blame Arnie? What for? 
 For your brother, doing what he did. 
 Are you talking about the other player's family? 
 Well, they blamed Brody. 
 Not Arnie? 
 Don't reckon. 
 Did they ever threaten Brody? 
 Not that I know of. 
 There must've been a lot of anger there. 
 They're a strong Christian family from up north. 
 Brody was forgiven. 
 I see. 
 I appreciate you asking. People don't want to talk about Brody anymore... 
 Must have been a tough time. 
 ..which is why I play the drum. 
 At the games? 
 Got to keep his memory alive somehow. 
 Keep his spirit present whenever the Cheetahs play. 
 No-one wants to talk about suicide, so I don't. 
 I just...play the drum. 
 For Brody? 
 Used to annoy Arnie sometimes. 
 (DRUM PLAYS) 
 ♪ Come on, you Cheetahs! ♪ 
 Len! Just for once. 
 Give it a rest, Lennie. Please. 
 Ah, chin up, Arnie. Could be worse. 
 Could be a vuvuzela. 
 So you were at every rugby game, not so much for the rugby, And the cheese rolls. 
 That's dedication! 
 They're really good cheese rolls. 
 Len, if you hear anything, you'll let me know, yeah? 
 Can do. 
 I'll leave you to your lunch. 
 Thanks very much. Bye. Get this. Arnie's neighbour just made contact. A Mrs Taylor. 
 And? 
 She said she heard a commotion outside Arnie's door the night in question. Three men were heard, yelling loudly around 10.30pm. She's sure they were local rugby lads. 
 Because? 
 They were wearing Cheetahs shirts. 
 What were they yelling? 
 Something about "coming out and facing the music". 
 Go and get some straight answers. 
 Your movements Sunday night? 
 I told you. Went to the Frog and Cheetah. 
 Celebration for our 50th straight loss. 
 Yeah, and then? 
 Went home. 
 Didn't go to Arnie's? 
 Why would I go to Arnie's? 
 You tell me. 
 Arnie was at the pub. Ask Davo, he's out the back. 
 Yeah, just drinking. Having a laugh about losing. 
 What else you gonna do? 
 You didn't go to visit Arnie? 
 Arnie was at the pub. 
 At his house. 
 I wasn't at his house. Was at the pub. 
 Yeah, he was there. I talked to Arnie, then I went home. 
 And what did you do? 
 Still at the Frog and Cheetah. 
 And then went home? 
 Well, it's not like we were gonna sleep there. 
 What time was this? 
 11:30pm. I dunno. Yeah, about 11:30pm. 
 Does the phrase, "Come out and face the music" mean anything to you? 
 No. Why? 
 "Come out and face the music?" No. Not really. 
 No. But then, I'm no musician, eh? 
 Actually. Come to think of it, Define, "a bit early". 
 10pm? 
 Yes. I was at the F and C. 
 Even though you didn't actually play in the game? 
 I'm still part of the team. Ray throws on a tab. 
 Who's gonna say no to a free beer? 
 What time d'you leave? 
 10ish. 
 And then where d'you go? Did you go to Arnie Langstone's? 
 Why would I do that? 
 To get him to face the music? 
 No, I... No, I didn't do that. 
 OK. So where did you go? Takeaway? 
 Midnight fishing? Skateboarding? Home? 
 Why does it matter? 
 Because you flat with Avo and Gazza and they both said they went home around 11:30pm. 
 So, I need someone to verify that. Can you verify that? 
 No. 
 Because they didn't come home, or you were asleep? 
 I was asleep, just not at home. 
 Where? 
 9 Connemara Drive. 
 Hello! Barbara! Barbara, it's Detective Sims, Brokenwood CIB. We met the other day. 
 Barbara! Barbara, I know you're in there. 
 Please go away. 
 I just have a couple of questions. 
 I don't have to talk to you. 
 It won't take very long. 
 I can't. I just can't. 
 Two minutes. 
 Listen to me. Just go away! Please! 
 Are you OK? Look, I just need to know if Steve Fanshaw stayed here on Sunday night. 
 So what if he did? 
 What time did Steve come around? 
 I can't really remember. 
 You couldn't get any more out of her? 
 Pulled down the shades. Literally. 
 You worried about self-harm? 
 People get bad news, they want to be left alone. 
 Maybe her and Steve are kaput. 
 Nah, I would've gleaned that from Steve. 
 He wasn't in break-up mode, he was in 'blood from a stone' mode. 
 So, she neglected to tell us she was having a relationship with one of Arnie's players. 
 A player with a history of violence, who'd recently been banned from the field by her ex-husband. 
 Mm. Whom she'd been separated from for four years. 
 But not divorced. 
 She's either protecting him or... 
 Herself? 
 Or both. 
 But why? 
 Ergh! Ergh! Ergh! Ergh! 
 What do you want? Did you do it? 
 Do what? I didn't lay a hand on Arnie. 
 You would say that. 
 What does that mean? 
 Someone bloody well did. Did you take matters into your own hands, Steve? 
 No. It's not like you haven't talked about it before. 
 It wasn't me. 
 Why should I believe you? The whole anger management course thing is a crock filler, you and I both know that. 
 I didn't touch him. 
 Then who did? 
 Why don't you ask your mates? 
 Davo and Gazza were with me. The question is, where did you go? 
 You were the one talking about stringing him up. 
 That was pub talk, nothing more. 
 Didn't seem like it. 
 Have you talked to the cops? 
 That lady cop came by. 
 What did you say? 
 Nothing. 
 Then best you keep it that way. You hear me? 
 Do you hear me, Steve? Good.

 Sims. Arnie had a life policy. 
 Didn't answer your phone? 
 It's not working. 
 Riverstone call? 
 Yes. More bad luck. 
 Two strikes and you're out. 
 Well. We'll just pay for it. 
 How? How, Steve? 
 Hemi's freaking out. 
 So he damn well should. 
 Look. You've got to tell the cops that I was with you. 
 I did. 
 Properly tell them. 
 Why don't you tell them? Everything? 
 Thanks for coming in. 
 I'm here. But, if I talk, I want you guys to back off the pressure. 
 Is she unwell? 
 She's got a lot going on, what with Arnie's death and all that. 
 OK. Well, let's talk and take it from there. 
 I would never hurt Arnie. That's why Barb and I kept our thing on the down-low. No-one in the team would hurt Arnie. Least, not on purpose, anyway. 
 Meaning? 
 Meaning maybe what happened was an accident. 
 What makes you say that? 
 It's just something that I've heard. 
 Where? 
 We were drinking at the pub. The whole team. 
 It was game night for Ray. 
 I'll give you a ride home for a couple of your famous cheese rolls! 
 Oh, you're a darling. 
 He hasn't got a car, Mrs Marlowe. 
 Hey, how did you get here? 
 On his bicycle. 
 You piking, coach? 
 I've got things to do, boys. Take it easy. 
 Here's to 50 straight losses. Must be some world record. 
 New Zealand world record. Remember what Arnie said after we lost the 25th game? 
 It's not losing 25 games that's important. 
 It's not losing another 25. If we lose 50 straight games, I'll eat this bloody ball. And I say that because... 
 You're really hungry? 
 Nice one. Thanks, Gaz. No. 
 Because it's not going to happen. 
 Pledge is a pledge. Time for him to eat his own words. 
 Serious? 
 He should wear it. Over his head. 
 No, he should wear nothing at all. Naked with a football on his head. 
 Tied up to a toilet! 
 Nah, to the goalpost. 
 To the goalpost. 
 And then take pictures. For the wall of shame. 
 Time for someone to face the music. 
 Face the music. 
 Face the music! Face the music! Face the music! Face the music! 
 You in, bro? 
 No. Look, I'm sure it was just supposed to be a laugh and that's all. 
 A laugh that ended up with a man dead? 
 Are you sure that's what they said? 
 Face the music? 
 You're suggesting this is just a prank gone wrong? 
 Yeah, we were going to string Arnie up as a laugh. 
 But we weren't ever going to hurt him. It was just payback. 
 He had to "face the music," right? 
 So you took him to the rugby field... 
 No. He wouldn't come out. Come on, Arnie! 
 Face the music, bro! Face the music. 
 Yeah, Arnie! 
 He's got a chick in there! 
 Arnie's gettin' some. 
 Things to bloody do, eh? 
 You saw a woman in his house? 
 Yeah. I figured he was busy. Didn't want to ruin his night. 
 What did this woman look like? 
 Old? Young? Hair colour? 
 It was dark. I couldn't see much. 
 Is this her? 
 Dunno. Maybe. 
 Which is it? Yes, or no? 
 It was dark and we were pissed. 
 So you saw her and then you went back to the Frog and Cheetah? 
 Yes. Rolled back in about 20 minutes later. Ray will back us up. 
 Oh, that all makes perfect sense, doesn't it? 
 Yeah. Mm-hm. 
 Yeah. All except for the bit where Arnie shows up dead, killed in a way that you and your mates outlined earlier. 
 Maybe someone did him in to make it look like we'd done it. 
 Someone like? 
 Someone like the guy that narked on us? 
 Steve? 
 All I'm saying is, he was there. He was part of our conversation. 
 And he was banging Arnie's ex-missus. 
 You knew about that? 
 Everyone knew about that. All except Arnie, I guess. 
 It was a busy night. I can't remember everyone's comings and goings. 
 They said they left around 10:15pm and returned 20 minutes later. 
 That's three of the team leaving and three returning. 
 You don't remember that? 
 They probably shot out for a feed. 
 Why would they do that when they could eat here? 
 'Cause they would have had to pay for it, the cheap bastards. Eh! 
 You'd be in for a bit of this, wouldn't you? What do you think? 
 Very aspirational. 
 We're going to need your CCTV footage. 
 We have a prank that supposedly didn't happen, but then it did. 
 And a suspect whose alibi is he was spending the night with the victim's ex-wife. Oh, and a mystery woman at Arnie's window. GG, you reckon? 
 Most likely. 
 Could it be that GG is Dana Clark? 
 She was 19 and he was 53. 
 Perhaps she shared an interest in classical music? 
 ♪ Well, you stood up tall, you stood up strong ♪ 
♪ You worked your own way through it all... ♪ 
 The records from the hook-up site will confirm who Dana was in Brokenwood to see. God, I kind of hope it wasn't Arnie.

 That's why the roses are there, not just to look pretty. 
 Yeah, the rose took one for the team and we could nip it in the bud, so to speak. 
 Like a canary in a coalmine. 
 Yeah, I don't think they do that with canaries anymore, Mike! 
 At first I thought it was some phomopsis viticola or maybe Botryosphaeria dieback, but it was definitely Elsinoe ampelina. 
 Good. Well done. 
 Hey. How's the Arnie thing? 
 I'd like to say it's early days, but... 
 Sad, eh? He was one of the good guys. 
 So everyone says. 
 He kept himself to himself but the rest of the time he was out here, giving back to the community. 
 Hi, Jared. Ooh, Ghislaine de feligonde? 
 Close. Rosa caravaggio. 
 Beautiful. 
 It is. 
 You have a great day, Mrs G. 
 Mrs G?

 Yeah. Gloria sorted me out this choice as book on quantum physics in relation to companion planting. 
 Gloria? Oh!

 Gloria Ginsberg? 
 Yeah. That's Gloria. 
 Ah! You were just with Jared. 
 Gloria, isn't it? 
 Yes. 
 Detective Senior Sergeant Mike Shepherd, Brokenwood CIB. 
 Can I help you? 
 I was wondering if you knew an Arnie Langstone? 
 Arnie? Yes, he came in here every now and then. 
 I was so sorry to hear that he passed away. 
 He was a regular? 
 One of our rare few, without an internet connection. 
 He preferred to get his information the old-fashioned way. 
 What did he usually check out? 
 Books about rugby and classical music. 
 He was very into classical. Could be an absolute bore on the subject. 
 You not big on the classics? 
 Give me a glass of chardonnay and the latest Holly Collins any day. 
 Did you know that Holly has a new album out soon? 
 I did. You're a country fan? 
 What's not to like about three chords and the truth? 
 Break-ups and breakdowns. Love, loss and losing. 
 Country music covers a lot of territory, doesn't it? 
 So, your relationship with Arnie, it was just... 
 He had a library card and I lent him books. 
 Would you have ever had reason to text Arnie? 
 Oh, that would be a bit difficult. 
 Why's that? 
 I don't own a cellphone. I'm a little old-fashioned, too.

 Third? 
 Body. Two in a week. What are they putting in the water up here? 
 We're getting close. 
 I know that look. You're nowhere near. 
 I'll be thinking of you, out on the high seas. 
 Gloria Ginsberg? 
 The Brokenwood librarian. 
 How did we miss that? 
 She must be new. 
 Who reads books these days? 
 Apparently Arnie did. 
 Is there a reason I got you back? 
 Sorry. 
 Finally, two things on this board that can actually be connected. 
 The underwear belongs to her? 
 I'm not saying that, but she knew Arnie. 
 And, if the underwear did belong to her, we need to find out the reason it ended up down Arnie's throat. 
 So we think that she sent the text message luring Arnie up there? 
 She doesn't text. 
 She told you that? 
 Mm. She doesn't own a cellphone. 
 Um. Sorry? What sort of a woman doesn't own a cellphone? The message was from a disposable, so maybe she had one, disposed of it, right after luring Arnie to his death. 
 Easy to say you don't own a cellphone if you threw it away. 
 Do me a background. 
 Hey. I meant to ask... 
 What does quantum physics have to do with gardening? 
 Well, everything. Quantum physics is the theory that logically leads to the conclusion that everything is interrelated. 
 And that what we see with our eyes is only a shallow form of a much deeper reality. 
 Or what we see is... 
 What we see is what we think we see. 
 And what's really there is most likely something we haven't even seen it. 
 Well, that's as clear as this beautifully opaque merlot. 
 What can you tell me about Gloria Ginsberg? 
 You sly dog! I knew it! I knew it! 
 Nah, she's a suspect in Arnie's murder. 
 Oh. Not much. 
 She moved here about a year ago. I was talking to her once about going to my uncle's tangi in Waipara. 
 She seemed to know the area really well. 
 (MOBILE RINGING) 
 Maybe she's from down those ways. 
 What have we got? 
 Better than good. We have Dana Clark's cellphone. 
 The tech lab has the phone. They're seeing what they can retrieve from it. Numbers, messages, photographs... 
 Great. 
 ..but we already know... 
 What? 
 ..the cause of the marks on Dana's head. 
 It was broken by way of her skull. And we've got the details back from the hook-up site. The person Dana was here to see was a 13-year-old girl. 
 What? 
 It's not what you think. 
 Dana was catfished. 
 Catfished? 
 Catfishing is when someone goes online and pretends to be someone they're not. Usually to mess with lonely hearts. 
 In this case, a 13-year-old girl called Carrie Moss was pretending to be a 25-year-old man named Eddie Ross. 
 Why? 
 Because teenagers do dumb things. Her parents confirmed she has done it once before. Dana came all the way out here for a booty call, only to discover that Eddie and his address didn't exist. 
 And then she turns around and heads back to Riverstone? 
 Except she didn't go back straight away. 
 She went to the Frog and Cheetah. She moves around the bar for about half an hour, but clearly doesn't know anyone and then leaves. 
 What time? 
 9:58pm After Arnie? 
 Yep. He left at 9:45pm. 
 What about the three musketeers? 
 Did they come and go as mentioned? 
 Yeah. Steve Fanshaw left at 10:05pm, and then those three leave at 10:17pm. 
 They come back at 10:49pm. 
 Not long enough to get out to the rugby ground and back. 
 Well, we still only have Barbara's word that Steve went to hers. 
 Yeah. Chase that up again. 
 I did a name search on librarians. Sexy stuff. No matches for a Gloria Ginsberg apart from the one here. It's as if she came out of nowhere. 
 Found a Gloria Palmer, though, worked in Weathersville for years. 
 She resigned last year.

 Come in. 
 Thanks. 
 Oh, hello again. Is this business or pleasure? 
 Well, it could be a bit of both, I suppose. 
 Like that Holly Collins song, "When you handcuff me, I feel like such a good girl gone so bad". 
 Er, no, I wasn't... 
 I'm sorry. So inappropriate. 
 Look, there's something I need to discuss. 
 I was wondering if you could pop by to the station at your earliest convenience? 
 It's a delicate matter, really. 
 Of course. 
 Arnie and I tried having kids. It never happened. 
 We had each other to get through that. 
 Then he found Brody in the tunnel, you know, as I said, things were never the same. Thanks. Then Arnie left and suddenly there was this vacuum, this empty life thinking, "Is that it?" I woke up on my 43rd birthday, and decided to do something about it. 
 The other day I got the news that my second IVF failed and I had a complete meltdown. Sorry about that. 
 Now I have to start paying. Ten grand a time. 
 I see. 
 Really? How old are you? 
 Mid-20s? Call me when you're 46 and on your very last roll of the dice. Then this came yesterday. 
 We thought it better that we show you rather than you find out. 
 It's not a lot. But it all comes to me. 
 Arnie never changed his will. 
 No points for guessing how you might spend it. 
 So this is where it all happens? 
 What's that? 
 What you do. Here at the coalface. 
 Well, I like to think it's not really a desk job. 
 The coalface tends to be out there. 
 I'm gonna cut to the chase. 
 OK. 
 Do these belong to you? 
 No. No. They don't. 
 You can see why I asked, though? 
 I'm sorry, I don't follow. 
 They've got your initials on. 
 That doesn't mean that they're mine. 
 I'm sorry, I had to ask, they're connected with Arnie's case and, well, you knew him, so... 
 Oh, well I can see how you'd think they're mine OK. I'm extremely sorry but, yeah, we've got to cover all bases here at the coalface. 
 Hey, did you know that Holly Collins is coming to town on her next tour? 
 I do and I can't wait! 
 Yeah, I might see you there. 
 Oh, yeah, I hope so. That would be really nice. 
 Or I might see her in Weathersville, I hear their town hall's a better venue. 
 Oh, no, no, no. See her here. The acoustics in that hall are terrible. 
 You know a bit about Weathersville, then? 
 Um, not really. 
 No? But that's where you're from, isn't it? 
 As a matter of interest, what brought you to Brokenwood? 
 Is it the same reason you changed your name? 
 Is it possible that I could speak with a woman detective about this? 
 So the life policy was for $100,000? 
 Yeah, not an insignificant sum. 
 Yeah, but enough to kill for? 
 Well, she had reason to need that money. 
 On the other hand, she was upfront about it. 
 Eventually. 
 Maybe she got wind we were onto it. 
 Be gentle. 
 He's very clever, isn't he? Pretending to be into country music, like that. 
 Ah, no, actually he's a big fan. 
 Really? I still feel tricked. 
 My favourite part of country music is when I can change the station. 
 So... What is it you can't talk to Mike about? 
 It's embarrassing, you see. 
 What is? 
 Yes. I changed my name. The truth is, I've had a few last names. I was Gloria Howard until my first husband left me for my best friend. She's still my best friend, actually. I know it's weird, but, then not long after that he was killed in a work accident. Nothing to do with me, but people talked. Then I was Gloria Palmer, until my second husband died in my arms, literally. 
 Another work-related incident? 
 He died while we were making love. Cardiac arrest. 
 Ironically, he was a doctor and, in a small town, nothing spreads faster than bad news except maybe salacious bad news. 
 I heard what they were saying about me. 
 Black widow. The joker. Doctor killer. So I had to leave and make a new start. I really don't want my past to follow me here. 
 Mm. Gloria, the underwear Mike showed you, you're sure they don't belong to you? 
 Yes. 
 And there was also a text on Arnie's phone. 
 Meet me at the club rooms, GG. And it was signed with kisses. 
 I explained to Mr Shepherd that I don't own a cellphone. 
 And I've never been to the club rooms. Oh. 
 What? 
 Oh, no, I did go to a game once. Arnie invited me. 
 ♪ Come on, you Cheetahs! ♪ 
 Len, give it a rest on the drum. 
 Oh, not again. 
 Would you like a cheese roll? 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Why did Arnie invite you to the game? 
 He liked me. But I didn't want another husband, not with my track record. And I'm just not really into rugby. 
 You don't have to tell Mr Shepherd about my past, do you? 
 Two dead husbands. You can see why she needed a new name. 
 New town, new start. 
 And Arnie was seeking her affections? 
 And Arnie ended up dead. 
 I've been thinking, I should revisit all the team members, someone must know something more. 
 No, I've got something more important for you. 
 Go down to the library. 
 Stake out Gloria Ginsberg? Sure. 
 No, get a book out on embroidery. 
 Good one. Right. 
 You were actually serious. Good. 
 Don't worry, there'll be lots of pictures. 
 Speaking of pictures, the boffins have extracted the pics from Dana's phone. 
 Oh, yeah? Anything useful? 
 Well, seen better photos of Bigfoot... 
 Yeah, no amount of enhancing will help that. 
 Taken at 11:50pm. 
 The last thing on her phone. 
 Whoever was out in that darkness is not her friend. 
 We can assume that Dana's killers saw her taking this photo... 
 And they didn't want that. 
 And... put the rugby ground here and Dana's car there, and the killer heading this way, we can assume that they were coming back from killing Arnie. 
 They saw her, freaked out... 
 And she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time? 
 And it also means that they were heading into Brokenwood, not away. 
 Probably local. 
 Cast of the footprint from Dana's crime scene. 
 Cinderella time, detective. 
 Do you want to play Prince Charming, or shall I? 
 Have fun. 
 Library. 
 You OK? 
 We have a deflated rugby ball. 
 Pair of women's underwear. 
 A woman in a red dress in Arnie's window, but also a dead woman in a red dress, lying in the stream. 
 We have a text message from GG but the only GG we know doesn't own a cellphone. 
 Nothing is connecting. 
 I almost forgot... Dana's car did run out of gas. 
 Beginner's guide to embroidery. Stitched up. 
 Sew excited. But it seems they haven't been issued. 
 Well, I've checked the shelves. They're not there. 
 Perhaps they've been misfiled. 
 I've had a really good look. 
 Well, they can't just disappear. 
 They weren't in. Of course, there's always the possibility she's lying. 
 Like she could be lying about not having a cellphone. 
 Or about fresh starts. 
 No match. Not even close. Although, interestingly, Steve Fanshaw's aren't here. 
 We know where to find them. 
 Do you want me to talk to Steve? 
 No. I want you to pay a visit to the Brokenwood sewing circle. 
 OK. This time, you're... No, again you're actually serious. 
 Such a terrible business with Arnie, wasn't it? 
 I'll be making an extra batch of my cheese rolls for the wake. 
 Nice. 
 Difficult for you too, Samuel, losing your coach like that and in such sordid circumstances. 
 Well, in my line of work you learn not to be surprised by anything. 
 Oh, it's true, then? 
 What? 
 The nature of his demise. He was bound and naked. 
 He was a homosexualist, then? 
 Er, no. Arnie wasn't that. This investigation is ongoing. 
 Oh, of course. 
 There is actually something that I need your help with. 
 It's a bit awkward, actually. I'm wondering what you can tell me about the embroidery on these? 
 Oh. Torn down the side. Crime of passion. 
 Yeah. It's the embroidery that we're interested in. 
 May I? Oh, a fine piece of work, you have to admire the technique. One or two irregularities there and there. Self-taught beginner, I'd say, not one I've seen before. They've got natural talent though. 
 See, all embroiderers have an individual style, signature or inconsistency that can reveal their identity. 
 Like a fingerprint, detective? 
 It was easily one of the most embarrassing moments of my entire career. It could only have been worse if I'd actually been wearing them. 
 Mm. In your dreams. 
 Brilliant! 
 Where's he going? 
 Here are all the titles Arnie has taken out since he joined. 
 Right, so, rugby, rugby, rugby, racing, home brewing, a lot of books on classical music. 
 He had a thing for Wagner, didn't he? Then Mozart then Rachmaninov. 
 Can I use one of those? 
 Sure.

 I had it embroidered... especially. 
 Arnie... I like you, I mean, you're very nice but, no. I'm sorry. 
 What is it with men and first dates in this town? 
 But it wasn't her first date with Arnie. 
 We're usually a lot better than this. 
 Gloria lied about the underwear to keep a low profile. So what? 
 Are you saying that, if she lied about that, she could've lied about the phone, too? 
 It's not what Gloria did, it's what Arnie did. 
 Not following. 
 There was more to Arnie than just rugby. 
 Arnie had a secret passion he couldn't tell anyone about. 
 It's one of the missing library books. 
 He embroidered the underwear he offered to Gloria. 
 He couldn't tell her. 
 Particularly when she balked. 
 His reputation would have been in tatters. 
 But that was just on the surface. 
 The mystery woman in the window. 
 It wasn't Dana or Gloria or even Barbara. 
 She never existed. 
 He's got a chick in there! 
 Arnie's getting some! 
 Things to bloody do, eh? 
 The boys assumed they saw a woman because we believe what we think we see. 
 Arnie was a cross-dresser. 
 Something he couldn't tell anyone about. 
 He enjoyed wearing women's undergarments. 
 Satin, silks, as did his hero, Wagner. 
 He, too, was a cross-dresser. 
 Don't cross-dressers tend to like to express themselves in public? 
 Dame Edna? Eddie Izzard? 
 But in Brokenwood? 
 As coach of the local rugby team and community leader? 
 On the face of it, Arnie was a rugby, racing and beer kind of guy. 
 He couldn't come out. 
 But what was the one feminine thing he could wear all the time? 
 So, are you saying... 
 Arnie wore women's underwear. 
 It was his own, OK. Fact. Arnie's house contained women's clothing. 
 But no sign of feminine hygiene products. 
 Men's shampoo, no conditioner. 
 Name me a woman that doesn't use conditioner. 
 Right. What about the second toothbrush? 
 One well-worn, one new. 
 Same brand, same colour. 
 Arnie simply hadn't thrown the old one away. 
 Are you saying that my rugby coach was a panty-wearing dude who taught himself to embroider? 
 Why are there no books on embroidery in the library? 
 Too scared to check them out, he simply appropriated them. 
 What else was he doing in there, if not making key hangers? 
 He wasn't making beer. 
 That kit had never been used. 
 OK. But wearing women's knickers isn't the same as choking on them. 
 What would make Arnie get up and go to the club rooms at 11pm? 
 A message from Gloria. 
 What was he expecting? Romance? 
 Forgiveness? Blackmail? 
 Who knows. But he went. 
 And his killer was waiting for him. 
 The underwear is ripped. Torn off. 
 Passion? 
 Or anger? 
 Your crap coaching killed my brother. 
 Please. 
 Get hard, Brody. 
 It's not bloody ballet. 
 Your open-side is sticking you. 
 What are you doing? He's first at the breakdown every bloody time. 
 Now get in there. And if you have to play the man, bloody well do it. 
 Harden up. 
 Len? But the CCTV footage places him at the bar. 
 No, it doesn't. 
 What? 
 Bring it up. 
 Len was always in the pub, Everyone always said. 
 There he is, 10:15pm. 
 Fast forward a minute. 
 He's there. 
 Look at the number on his back. 
 Len always wore the number seven. 
 He'd already gone. Rewind it. 
 There he is, seeing Dana Clark. 
 Scroll through. 
 There. 
 We were too busy looking at the boys to notice. 
 Len left at 10:23pm and someone else took his place. 
 Oh, my god. Len got himself an alibi without even trying. 
 As he left to deal with Arnie. 
 We believe what we think we see. 
 And. And...you sick bloody pervert. 
 Don't tell anyone. I beg you. 
 Arnie... your secret's safe with me. 
 (GRUNTING AND GROANING) 
 (DRUM BEATS SLOWLY) 
 (GASPING) 
 So it was revenge for his brother committing suicide? 
 It was ten years ago, but Len never let it go. 
 Banging his drum. 
 It's a long-term plan. 
 Or it's opportunistic. 
 Things to bloody do, eh? 
 He followed the boys, hoping to see Arnie disgraced. 
 And, when it didn't happen, he took matters into his own hands. 
 Len catfished Arnie into thinking he was Gloria. 
 Because he knew that Arnie was keen on Gloria. And, when Len saw Dana on the other side of the road, he knew that she could identify him. 
 Len! 
 Len Carson! 
 Mike Shepherd. 
 Hello? 
 Len? 
 I bet they match your plaster cast. 
 ♪ Come on, you Cheetahs! ♪ 
 My god. It's like a shrine to his brother. 
 They weren't just brothers. 
 They were twins. 
 So when Arnie said there was a ghost on the sidelines, he wasn't just using a colourful metaphor. 
 (CAR DOOR CLOSES, ENGINE STARTS) 
 Oh, Christ! 
 Look what he's done to her! 
 He's getting away, Mike. 
 Yeah, yeah, I know where he's headed. 
 Call Breen, tell him to meet us there. 
 Where? 
 The goalposts. 
 Oh, god, what a bloody mess! 
 Come on! 
 Ergh! 
 Breen, where are you? 
 What's this about? What's that about? 
 Don't go there. Len's following in his brother's footsteps. 
 Or not. 
 Bugger! 
 The tunnel. 
 What? 
 Barbara, she said, "Everything changed when Arnie found Brody in the tunnel." He didn't do it from the goalposts! 
 I'll go this way. Len! 
 Len Carson! 
 Len, stop! 
 You don't have to do this. 
 Listen to me, Len. 
 Sorry about the girl. 
 Cut him down, cut him down! 
 (GROANING) 
 Len Carson, I'm arresting you for the murder of Arnie Langstone and Dana Clark. 
 You move that fast in the game and you might start winning. 
 Thanks, Comms, we're bringing him in. 
 I've got a spare roller if you want to finish the job. 
 So, you reckon you'll come and watch Breen's team play now they're a fan down? 
 Maybe. If only to try these cheese rolls everyone keeps talking about.
