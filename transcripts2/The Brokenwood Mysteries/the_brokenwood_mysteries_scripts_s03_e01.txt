 And coming up on your right, a great photo opportunity for Rivendella.

 It very small. That's the magic of the movies. 
 Too small to be Rivendell. 
 In the movies, they film things small because they get blown up bigger for the big screen, right? 
 If this was actual size, it wouldn't fit in the cinema. 
 This is insulting. 
 Oh, you speak English. 
 Ja, of course. And I think rings is not spelt with a 'Z'. 
 Well, Kiwi is an evolving language. 
 In NZ, the use of a 'Z' is commonplace. 
 Maybe go closer? 
 Oh, no. No, no. No, no, no. 
 You wouldn't wanna do that. 
 Yes. 
 Not with possible landslides, orcs. 
 Orcs are not real. 
 If that's your attitude, why'd you come on the tour? 
 For the lunch. 
 Mm. 
 Yeah, all right. And giant spiders! 
 Giant spiders! 
 Right, then. Back in the van. 
 Next stop - an excerpt from Helmet's Deep. 
 Both : Yah! Yah! Yah! 
 Yah! 
 Ah! 
 Ah! 
 Ah! 
 (YELLS) 
 Ah! 
 (ALL GASP) 
 (SCOTTISH-THEMED MUSIC) 
 Yah! 
 Thanks, folks. Feel free to come and take photos. 
 (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK) 
 Helm's Deep was not in a glade. 
 It was a big battle across varied terrain. 
 I want my lunch. 
 All in good time. 
 Satisfied customers - you should try it sometime. 
 Next stop - Mirklewood. 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 Whoa! 
 (GRAVEL CRUNCHES) 
 Gifford, ya mad b*st*rd! 
 (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
 Gotcha. You've blown it this time, fella! 
 (INTENSE MUSIC) 
 Nothing to worry about, folks. Just a Black Rider. 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK) 
 Mein Gott. 
 Mirklewood? This is simply not correct. 
 Calm down. This is the best bit. 
 And it was about here - well, over there actually - that Bilbo Baggins encountered the giant spider. 
 Can I have a volunteer to see if, in fact, that spider still lurks here in Mirklewood? 
 (BIRDS CHIRP) 
 Great. Step forward. Come. 
 (INTENSE MUSIC) 
 Don't be nervous - it won't kill you. 
 Well, it might.

 Pretty scary, huh? Please tell your friends - 
 Ray's Tours, a full 3D experience. 
 This is my wife, Debbie. 
 Debbie, say hello. Debbie's the brains of the organisation. 
 I'm the looks. 
 Ray. 
 OK, Debbie, that's enough. 
 (INTENSE MUSIC) 
 Debbie? 
 Debbie? 
 Oh my God. 
 Sweet Jesus! 
 (SCREAMING) 
 (EERIE MUSIC)

 (SIGHS) 
 (SIREN WAILS) 
 Debbie, I don't know what you saw, but it was obviously unexpected. 
 Something very very frightening? 
 You'll be out of here soon. I promise. 
 You nodded. 
 What? 
 As if she answered your question. 
 Did I? That's weird. 
 It was rhetorical. 
 Isn't it always? 
 No. 
 (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
 Thanks. 
 (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
 Given the amount of web,... maybe it's possible there is actually a giant spider of some kind living in here. 
 Are you serious? 
 Science has only scratched the surface of known species on the planet. 
 Have you got a thing about spiders? 
 Ew. What? No. No, not at all. 
 (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
 She was a diabetic. 
 I see. 
 She would have gone into a diabetic coma and not made it to her insulin on time. 
 I guess that's one possibility. 
 That's the only one I can see. 
 It was always the sword of Damocles hanging over her. 
 We used to joke about it - the sword of Diabetes. 
 Do you remember her taking her insulin this morning? 
 I wouldn't know. Wasn't something we did together. 
 Um, we get lunch now? 
 Hey, Ray's just lost his wife - serving lunch isn't really a high priority at this time. 
 It was part of the outrageous ticket price. 
 I know. 
 Then, uh, maybe you do it. 
 Um... 
 It's OK, boys. Take them back to the Frog &amp; Cheetah and get them some burgers and chips. 
 No, not burger and chips - what you say. 
 We do a great London pride sausage. 
 Please. I'll meet you there. 
 Everybody, come on. 
 You needn't go out of your way. 
 I'm a businessman - word of mouth is everything. 
 Still, this is an extraordinary situation. 
 Well, I can't risk bad reviews on Trip Advisor. 
 Ray, I'll need a statement. 
 After I've dealt with these clients. 
 I'll meet you at the station. 
 Ray seems to be holding it together very well for a man who just found his wife dead. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Shepherd. 
 Mike. 
 Simon. Thanks for calling me back. 
 How's the vintage? 
 Uh, we'll know soon. 
 That case of rose went down well last year. 
 It was Merlot. 
 Oh. Sorry. Am I still on your Christmas list? 
 We'll see. Your wife, Linda... 
 Oi, keep your hands off. 
 Don't you think you've had enough wives to last several lifetimes? 
 She's a diabetic? 
 She is. Why? 
 Has she ever fallen into a coma? 
 Uh, once. Messy business. 
 She forgot her shot. 
 Went quite la-la before I realised and managed to jab her. 
 And if you hadn't? 
 I'd be a widower. 
 And pretty bloody sad about it. 
 Where are you going with this? 
 An unexplained death. 
 Just getting some background. 
 Give my love to Linda. 
 Like hell. 
 Are we treating this as a homicide? 
 An unexplained death. 
 Coffee's made. 
 I'm good, thanks. 
 Here's the thing - I spoke to Nigel Medlock and Billy Franks. 
 It was a doubly whammy - not only did they get freaked out by the spider... but then they'd be confronted by a web-bound corpse, and it would really tip them over. 
 Like, it would totally freak them out. 
 It worked every time. 
 Well, that is, until today. 
 It wasn't meant to be a real corpse, and not, like, Debbie. 
 Debbie was a great boss. 
 Yeah, totally the best. 
 Debbie was always planted ahead of the group. 
 Planted? 
 Put in her cocoon of spiders web. 
 Fake. Notable by its Velcro seam. 
 But she's trapped, right? Waiting for the tour group to arrive. 
 She slips into a diabetic coma and can't reach her insulin. 
 Which surely makes it a workplace accident. 
 Yeah, which means that the only actual crime committed was the fleecing of non-English-speaking tourists with the ruse that the Lord of the Rings was actually filmed in Brokenwood. 
 Pretty much. 
 Except that Ray Neilson's response was very matter-of-fact. 
 Grief hits people in different ways. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Gina. 
 Mike. Ready when you are. 
 On my way. Take Ray's statement when he comes in. 
 Roger that. 
 And I'll type up my notes... on a workplace accident. 
 This insulin pen, this was in her pocket? 
 Right-side trouser. 
 Hm. 
 Is there anything at a glance to suggest a diabetic coma? 
 I won't know that until I get inside, but the pronounced rigidity is unusual. 
 Well, isn't that rigor mortis? 
 Maybe, but there are the oedematous eyelids. 
 Edema what? 
 Swollen, Mike - they are unusually swollen. 
 This is more like latrodectism. 
 Which is? 
 Usually caused by venom. 
 Perhaps snake, stonefish or the poisonous golden dart frog. 
 None of those live in NZ. 
 Or a spider. 
 (DRAMATIC MUSIC) 
 I think we have found the culprit. 
 It is a black widow. 
 No, that would be a katipo. 
 I can't find any site of a bite mark. 
 Well, what about these? 
 The thigh, a common site for an insulin injection. 
 Evident here too, the abdomen. 
 You checked the mouth? 
 In soft tissue like the mouth, there would be noticeable swelling. 
 What I can tell you is the time of death was less than six hours ago. 
 Which puts it close to the time of discovery. 
 The level of rigor mortis is perhaps enhanced by the spider venom, but... 
 But you can't locate the bite mark. 
 I will keep searching while I wait for Toxicology to report. 
 Until then, I can't attribute the death to the spider. 
 What about a diabetic coma? 
 We will know more soon. 
 Thank you, Gina. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Mike. 
 What do you know about the katipo? 
 The katipo spider? 
 One was in Debbie Neilson's mouth. 
 Wow. 
 Um, it's venomous, right? 
 Black with red hourglass markings. 
 NZ's deadliest spider, I believe. 
 That's what I thought. 
 As a matter of interest, there's a research project based out at Brokenwood Beach, a PhD student studying katipo. 
 Good. Find out everything we can. 
 Yeah. I'll, uh, get Breen on to it. 
 Did Ray Neilson have anything useful to say? 
 No, he hasn't shown up. 
 I'm just about to head down to the Frog &amp; Cheetah. 
 I'll meet you there. 
 (PHONE KEYPAD BEEPS) 
 (PAPER RUSTLES) 
 Chandra Singh, arachnologist. 
 Meaning someone who loves spiders? 
 Mm. Do you have a problem? 
 No. Not at all. I'll give them a call. No problem. 
 Best to visit. Scientists are usually useless over the phone. 
 Sure. 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 (PHONE CLICKS) 
 (MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 Do you guys want another round? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Same again? 
 (MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 Hi. Is, uh, Ray about? 
 You the cops? 
 DSS Mike Shepherd; Detective Sims. 
 Trudy, Ray's sister. Got the news and drove over from Riverstone. 
 That's good of you to step in. 
 Family - you do what you have to. 
 You might wanna leave Ray alone for a bit. He's a bit sad. 
 Yeah, that's understandable. 
 I gave him a Valium to take the edge off. 
 Is he sleeping? 
 No. 
 Well, then a quick word would be helpful. 
 For him or you? 
 Perhaps both. 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) 
 (DOOR SQUEAKS) 
 The idea was they weren't supposed to be able to speak English. 
 Well, there was a German bloke whose English was better than mine! 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 No, no. Business as usual. 
 Ray, it's the cops. 
 Oh. Right. 
 Ray. 
 G'day. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Yeah, alright, Trude. 
 You sure? 
 Sister. Bit overprotective. 
 Well, it's good of her to step in. 
 Yeah, well, needs must. 
 I'm sorry I didn't come by earlier - things went a bit mad. 
 Mixing whisky and Valium may not help that. 
 It's just the one. Surely, you wouldn't deny a man a drink. 
 It's not every day your wife dies. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That didn't come out right. 
 It's OK, Ray. Look, the post-mortem has suggested thatP Diabetes? 
 It's inconclusive, but there's the possibility that Debbie's fatality may be the result of a spider bite. 
 What, a katipo? No way. 
 A katipo was found on her person, but as of yet there's no evidence of an actual bite. 
 Well if there was no bite, then it wasn't a spider. 
 Well, we're still waiting to hear back from Toxicology. 
 Obviously, we'll keep you updated. 
 You, uh, been burning the midnight? 
 What? 
 Oh yeah. Busy times. 
 Uh, when was the last time you saw Debbie alive? 
 This morning. 
 Why? 
 What time exactly? 
 What does it matter? 
 Why, did Billy say something? 
 About what? 
 Billy, Billy, Billy. 
 Look, we had words. 
 It was nothing serious. 
 What, you and Debbie? 
 Well, how much bloody longer? 
 I've spoken to Damo, and there should be another van by the end of the week. 
 End of the week? 
 Well it's better late than never. 
 I could strangle you sometimes, Ray Neilson! 
 Hi. 
 Uh, you know what? I'll just, um, wait in the van. 
 We're missing out on serious cash. 
 I know. 
 We could be doing three times what we're putting through now - 
 I know! 
 And if we don't take it, Gifford and Davis will be rubbing their hands with glee. 
 Damo is? 
 From Real Cheap Cars on Teeling St. 
 I was after another van, to expand the business. 
 And Gifford and Davis are? 
 They're other tour operators. 
 Sounds like Debbie was quite competitive. 
 Don't get the wrong idea. 
 She rubbed people up the wrong way, but she had a bloody good heart. 
 It's always the way - you fight, they die. 
 (CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Oh, hell, evening rush soon. 
 Ray, you should take it easy. 
 Yeah, well life goes on. 
 I mean, it has to. 
 We need that statement, Ray. 
 Not now. I should help Trudy. 
 First thing tomorrow, then? 
 First thing. 
 (MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 The mattress - do you think that Ray and Debbie were sleeping apart? 
 Looks that way. 
 And what do you think Ray meant when he said, 'You fight, they die'? 
 Well, it's not uncommon - when people lose a loved one, they beat themselves up that the last time they spoke was in anger. 
 Is that what happened to you, when your wife drowned? 
 Me? No. 
 I was lucky.

 Hey, dude. 
 Chandra Singh? 
 (SCOFFS) Do I look like a Singh? Or a Chandra? It's a girl's name, bro. 
 Sorry. DC Breen, Brokenwood CIB. 
 I'm after some expert information on spiders. 
 Arachnids. 
 Yes, arachnids. 
 Yeah. You're after my fiancee, bro. 
 Right. I left a bunch of messages, but she never returned my calls. 
 Don't take it personally, bro. 
 She never answers her phone. 
 Too busy out in the field with her eight-legged friends - that's her jag. 
 You're a spider expert too? 
 Oh, no. No way, man. No. 
 Elasmobranchology's my thing. 
 OK. 
 I'm a shark scientist. 
 Dr Byron Cotter at your service. 
 So, Chandra? 
 Oh right. Yeah. Follow me. 
 Living out here suits us both. 
 My subjects are out there; Chandra's are right here amongst the driftwood and tussock. 
 You must go out pretty deep with your work. 
 No. My research is the study of sharks in shallow water, so everything I do is within 100m of shore. 
 Really, they come in that close? 
 Yeah. Right now, I'd say there'd be 35 out there. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah, I know them all by name. Cool job, huh? 
 If you like sharks. 
 Like? I love them, dude. 
 Ah, there she is. 
 (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) 
 Hey, babe! 
 Sh! 
 Dammit. Lost her. 
 Sorry, babe. Hey, this is, um... 
 Detective Constable Breen. 
 Hello. Chandra Singh. 
 What did you lose? 
 A female katipo... ripe with venom. 
 (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) 
 Oh cool. Uh, that's actually why I'm here. 
 There's a possibility there's been a fatality from one in Brokenwood Forest. 
 Whoa. Heavy. 
 I doubt it's true. 
 Katipo aren't forest dwellers. 
 Yeah, true. 
 Well, as part of a workplace accident investigation, we need to understand more about them. 
 (HORSE WHINNIES) 
 Get out of here, you monster! 
 Didn't see you there! 
 You have no right! I will report you to the authorities! 
 You have to understand, she's very passionate about her work. 
 Horses have no place in this fragile habitat, no place. 
 Nobody understands. 
 Hey, I do, babe. You know that. 
 So, you think you can help the detective? 
 Yep. 
 Sweet. Surf's pumping. 
 I might get one in before dark. 
 You really like to get amongst your subjects, huh? 
 They're not my subjects, dude; they're my friends. Catch ya! 
 Would you like to meetmyfriends? 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 (DOOR CREAKS) 
 This is where I work. 
 OK. 
 Do you know Delena cancerides? 
 Delena. Does she run the Greek restaurant in town? 
 The Latin name for the Avondale spider. 
 (DRAMATIC MUSIC) 
 Whoa! That's... a big one. 
 And completely harmless. 
 This is where we do the milking. 
 Milking? 
 Of the venom. I send it away to a company that produces an antivenom. 
 It funds my research. 
 You can milk something that small? 
 Mm. With the help of a microscope. I have Esther here ready and waiting. 
 Take a look. 
 No, I'm OK. 
 It's perfectly safe. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (GASPS) 
 Whoa. That's really... 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 (THUD!) 
 I hadn't eaten, OK? It'd been a long day. The blood sugar dropped. 
 And you saw a spider. 
 Yes, I saw a spider - 
 I was in a spider lab. 
 It wasn't the spider; the lab was very warm and... 
 And what did you learn? 
 Before the ambulance came. 
 There was no ambulance. 
 Chandra's adamant a katipo couldn't have killed Debbie. 
 They're demonised, but pretty harmless really. 
 But they are venomous. 
 Yes, but their potency is overestimated. 
 You could say that their bark's worse than their bite. 
 So their venom isn't lethal? 
 It is, but they only bite if they're startled, agitated or trapped against your skin. 
 And even if Debbie was bitten, it's unlikely to have killed her. 
 There hasn't been a fatality from a katipo since 1901. 
 But more importantly, katipo don't live in forests. 
 Their habitat is strictly coastal. 
 You feeling better? 
 But there was a katipo. 
 It was in her mouth. 
 Whoa. 
 So, then, how did it get there? 
 (DOOR SHUTS) 
 Senior, a Mr Zeigler to have a word. 
 Hans, isn't it? 
 Ja. I wish to make a complaint. 
 Against? 
 The Lord of the Ringz Tours. 
 It was ridiculous. 
 That is your complaint? 
 I have watched the DVD - none of this was filmed here. None! 
 And there were motorbikes driving through the scenery, silly people with wooden shields, a dead woman. 
 This is not fun. 
 The lunch was not what was promised. 
 They gave us burgers. 
 You don't like burgers? 
 Why would I travel halfway around the world to eat burgers? 
 They were invented in Germany. 
 Not America? 
 Nein. Hamburg, of course. 
 But this is not important. 
 I want it recorded that this Ray Neilson is a rip-off merchant. 
 Who has just lost his wife. 
 This is sad, yes. 
 But this is not my fault. 
 You said there were motorbikes? 
 Ja. And there were no motorbikes in Lord of the Rings. 
 Why is this there? Nonsense. 
 So I wish to lay a complaint. 
 DC Breen will take your details and follow up. 
 I hope he does. 
 (FOOTSTEPS RECEDE) 
 Zeigler reckons there was a motorbike up there. 
 Ray never mentioned a motorbike. 
 Maybe he would have if he'd given us a proper witness statement. 
 I've tried all his numbers. 
 He's still not answering. 
 What about Billy or Nigel? 
 It wasn't a trail bike - a quad bike, a red one. 
 It was Lance Gifford blatting down the track. 
 Woah! 
 He almost took out the van. 
 Ray was pissed off. 
 Gifford can't accept he's got no permit to be in here. 
 Then he goes and pulls a stunt like that. 
 It's our exclusive right for health and safety reasons. 
 I mean, we're running a blimmin' professional operation here! 
 Lance was always giving Ray the finger any chance he could. 
 Oh, come on. 
 (BIKE MOTOR LABOURS) 
 (PANTS) 
 Come on. (GRUNTS) 
 (BIKE MOTOR LABOURS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Lance? 
 Yeah. 
 DSS Mike Shepherd. Detective Sims. 
 Nah, I won't shake. 
 What do you want? 
 You run tour groups with these? 
 Yeah, when I can. 
 Were you riding through Brokenwood Forest yesterday around 11:15? 
 What do you mean riding? 
 Well, riding, racing, going fast on one of these. 
 Nah. 
 Yeah, we have a witness who believes you were. 
 You just about took out Ray Neilson's tour van. 
 Is that right? Well, I would love to have been blatting through the forest while Ray was poncing around with his tours, but I wasn't - I'm not allowed. 
 'Cause you have no permit? 
 That's right. 
 Even though I have every right to. 
 Despite what Debbie Neilson believes, that forest is not theirs to colonise with their fake film sets. 
 Are you aware that Debbie Neilson passed away yesterday? 
 Right. That's too bad. But, you know, it couldn't have been me. 
 That caused her death? 
 No, it couldn't have been me riding in the forest. 
 My bikes weren't working. 
 All of them? 
 Yeah, they all had sugar in their petrol tank. 
 Sabotage? 
 Ray bloody Neilson, no less. 
 Well if you're so certain, why didn't you lay a complaint? 
 No proof. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Excuse me. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Which doesn't mean he didn't do it. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Hello? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. 
 Um, well,... the bikes are off road - literally. 
 Uh, maybe they'll be good to go in a couple of days, so then we could... 
 Yeah, righto. 
 That's bloody typical. 
 The calls come in when the bikes are broke. 
 Did any other tour operators feel the same way about Ray's Tours? 
 No, I stick to myself, mainly. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 Oh, Nicole Davis? 
 Maybe. I don't know. 
 OK. Thanks. 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 I'll track down Ray, get him to verify that it was Lance Gifford on that bike. 
 Happy horse riding. 
 I tell you - me, horses and happy don't belong in the same sentence. 
 (CHUCKLES) Hey, um, if you don't mind me asking, why were you lucky? 
 Hm? 
 You said you were lucky the day that your wife drowned. 
 Ah, yes. She contacted me. 
 You mean, after she was dead? 
 Yeah. So I felt lucky. 
 Right. 
 Better go.

 I have a couple of questions about Debbie Neilson. 
 Oh, well, I'll leave you to it.

 I don't really know Debbie. 
 Debbie was found dead yesterday. 
 That's a shame. 
 I've gotta exercise these two. I hope you can ride. 
 (HORSE WHINNIES) 
 It's a shame about Debbie. 
 She was a nice person. 
 Some people say she gave local tourism a bad name. 
 If that were the case, her tours wouldn't have been so popular. 
 Popular at the expense of yours? 
 Well, people who wanna ride horses aren't necessarily interested in tacky Hobbit tours. 
 You, uh, got on alright, then? 
 Well, I admit when her and Ray got into the game, things were a bit tense. But we're still in business. 
 Lance Gifford feels a bit more passionate about it. 
 Why, what did he say? 
 Very little. That's why I'm talking to you.

 Yeah, well, horse riding's a great way to get fit, Mike. 
 You think I'm unfit? 
 Well, there's fit, and then there's fitter. 
 Oh. 
 Is that Lance Gifford? 
 Yeah. Must've got his bike working. He's had troubles. 
 So he said. 
 Why did Nicole take off? 
 Yeah, sorry - we got a tour booking. 
 There's a group of people wanna go for a trek up the forest the day after tomorrow. 
 It takes a bit of organising with the float transport. 
 Nicole rides in the forest? 
 Yeah. Used to be a popular trek before the Lord of the Rings thing cut them out and had them banned. 
 I guess Ray's shutting down, so Nicole's allowed back in there. 
 (PHONE RINGS)

 Mike, the toxicology report confirms that Debbie's death was a result of spider venom. 
 Right. 
 But 10 times the lethal dose. 
 We're dealing with a homicide.

 I've always thought they were beautiful. 
 The thing I like most is, unlike birds, in arachnids, the female - 
 The female is the bigger and more beautiful of the sexes, right? 
 Right. You've done your homework. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Chandra, you told DC Breen that one bite was unlikely to be fatal. 
 Unless the person has a pre-existing condition, such as asthma, heart problems. 
 But 10 bites could be? 
 Yes, but one spider couldn't do it. They don't carry enough venom. 
 So, Chandra, you collect venom. 
 Yes. To make antidote. 
 Mm. And I presume you store it in vials somewhere safe. 
 Well,... yes. 
 Any gone missing? 
 When you say any, you imply that there are many. 
 Well, how many do you have? 
 One. There's only ever one, and it is barely half full, and it is right here. 
 You need to understand that to collect 1cc of venom takes thousands of milkings. 
 It's a laborious process. This... is eight weeks' hard work. 
 So it's all there? 
 Yes. 
 And no break-ins or unusual activities recently? 
 No. 
 There's no conspiracy, detective. 
 Everything is where it should be. 
 Do you, uh, make the antidote here? 
 No, I send it off to a lab, which finishes the process. 
 They like my venom because I harvest most of it from outdoor-raised spiders. 
 I farm them in their natural habitat. 
 Free range. 
 It's better quality. 
 But I bring them in to milk them. 
 You said there were 15 in here? 
 Yes. I know them all by name. 
 How many out there free ranging? 
 Currently 142. 
 I run a breeding programme. 
 Is, uh... Is this one familiar? 
 Oh, is she the one in question? 
 I can't tell by a photo. I identify most of them by personality. 
 You said their, uh, natural habitat is the coast. 
 Yes. 
 Have you ever known one to migrate? 
 As in wander 2km into the forest? No. 
 There are 14 in here. 
 What? 
 You said there were 15 in here, but I can only count 14. 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
 That'll be Amber. Sometimes her and Tara go walkabout. 
 They just return to the wild. 
 After all, it's where they belong. 
 Are you sure this isn't Amber? 
 Like I said, I can't tell from a photo. 
 Rather than walkabout, is it possible someone could have taken her? 
 No one comes here. 
 OK. Uh, thanks for your time. 
 (INTENSE MUSIC) 
 (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) 
 A spider gone AWOL. 
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
 Yep. But with 142 out there in the wild, the katipo on Debbie's body could just as easily have come from out here. 
 Mm. And who would have thought that the dairy farming model could be applied to spiders? 
 It's kind of curious. 
 As is the fact that she's a diabetic. 
 The insulin pen on her desk. 
 Oh. How did I miss that? 
 You were too busy flirting with the spiders. 
 G'day. How's it going? 
 Nice day for it. 
 Oh, yeah, it's beautiful out there. 4.5ft, offshore. 
 You the other detectives, eh? 
 Mike Shepherd. Kristin Sims. 
 Hi. 
 Pleased to meet you both. 
 I'm Byron Cotter, Chandra's partner. 
 So, Byron, you, uh, share a love of arachnids? 
 Oh, no way, dude. 
 No, I, uh, actually have a bit of a thing about spiders. 
 But don't tell anyone. 
 Much happier swimming with sharks. Oh, look at this girl. 
 3.5m bronze whaler. 
 (CAMERA BEEPS) 
 Just off the beach here. Eh? 
 Impressive. 
 Yeah, her name's Kitty. 
 Chandra wasn't too down, was she? 
 No, she was very helpful. 
 She just worries the katipo will be demonised through the publicity. 
 The cause of death hasn't been confirmed or released. 
 Sweet. Let's just hope people don't get the wrong idea. 
 As they do with sharks? 
 Exactly, dude. 
 You, uh, take care out there, Byron. 
 Yeah, you too, dude. 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 (MUSIC FADES) 
 What do we know? 
 Debbie Neilson was murdered, but how the venom was administered and by whom is still unclear. 
 Lance Gifford - had a genuine problem with Debbie,... was seen in the vicinity, but denies it. 
 Nicole Davis also felt aggrieved by Debbie's dealings with the council, used that portion of the forest for trekking. 
 She was familiar with the crime scene. 
 Chandra Singh certainly has access to the venom, but has no known connection to the deceased. But... 
 Ray does. 
 And Ray and Debbie argued that morning about expanding their business. But was that all? 
 I mean, was this whole thing an elaborate plan by Ray to kill his wife? 
 We have to ask the question. 
 Where are we at with Ray? 
 He's still being elusive. 
 He's a witness, for God's sake. 
 I've left him half a dozen messages. 
 Perhaps there's something he doesn't wanna say. 
 Keep calling him. 
 Meanwhile, I'll have a meeting with a giant arachnid. 
 (SQUEAKING) 
 We'd come by after the LARPing while Ray had them over at Mt Doomed, and we'd make sure the spider was rigged, and then put Debbie in place as the corpse. 
 Why didn't you use a dummy? 
 Well, Debbie wanted maximum effect, and a dummy would just sit there. 
 Which is a little bit scary. 
 But with her as the corpse, she could... 
 (ALL GASP) 
 ..give a little lunge and really ramp things up. 
 She really went that extra mile to give value for money. 
 Yeah, well, she believed in word of mouth. 
 Show them a good time, they'll tell two people - they'll tell two people. 
 The ticket price was high, though? 
 Well, it included lunch. 
 Gold-plated sausage rolls? 
 Maybe. We don't know. 
 Well, that was Debbie's department. 
 She took them off to a glade further down the track, and she wined and dined them. 
 We were left to pack up. 
 Although, apparently, what she did serve them was crap. 
 Debs, we can't do this! 
 They've already paid for it! 
 We can't serve them that crap. It's wrong! 
 Would you mind trussing me up in that suit? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 I like to play the victim. 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 She always perched here. 
 (MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 Hm. 
 (ROPES CREAK) 
 Once Debbie was trussed up, she was a sitting duck. 
 So the killer could have easily stepped up and administered the venom? 
 Yes. But how,... we still don't know. 
 At that dosage, only would have taken a few minutes for her to lose consciousness. 
 Whoever it was, they must have known the timeline she worked on, to be ready to take advantage of that window of opportunity. 
 Lance knew. 
 And he was supposedly there during the timeframe. 
 Nicole Davis? 
 Hm. Possibly. 
 Ray, of course, and Billy and Nigel were the last to see her. 
 Not on this day. 
 So you'd, um, set up the rig and help Debbie in and out of this each tour? 
 Yep. 
 So on the morning of her death, you would have been the last to see her alive. 
 Normally, yeah. 
 But not that morning. 
 Something came up. 
 We're running late. 
 We need to head across and rig up the spider and Debbie. 
 Don't worry - it's all been done. 
 Oh. 
 Debbie was a bit antsy about the schedule. 
 She wanted to get away early for a hair appointment. 
 Right. 
 I've just been up there. 
 It's all sorted. 
 So Ray was actually the last to see her alive. 
 It seems that way. 
 Not something he's mentioned up until now. 
 Then again, he hasn't really mentioned anything much at all. 
 (BIRDS CHIRP) 
 Nice set of wheels. 
 Business must be booming. 
 It was. 
 You're a hard man to track down, Ray. 
 Got a lot going on. You get that when your wife dies. 
 Yeah, about that - you forgot to mention that you were probably the last person to see her alive. 
 Sorry? 
 You were the one who put her in the web suit. 
 I was. 
 Which was not the usual way of doing things. 
 We were behind schedule. 
 Sorry - my mind was fuddled. 
 Which is why it would be good to get that statement from you, before anything else gets fuddled or, even worse, forgotten. 
 I will. 
 Now would be good. 
 I've gotta get down to council to sort the permit issue. 
 I'll be down straight after. 
 Ray, don't fob me off. 
 I'll be there. 
 What is the permit issue? 
 Lance Gifford wants to buy my permitting rights to the forest. 
 He doesn't waste any time. 
 Well, he was never one to pussyfoot around. 
 And you're being very accommodating. 
 He's a fellow businessman. 
 Or are you trying to make amends for putting sugar in his petrol tanks? 
 What? He said that?! 
 He seemed pretty clear. 
 That's bloody libellous. 
 So you didn't do it? 
 No! Why would I? He had no permit. He wasn't a threat. 
 Any idea who might've? 
 No. But it wasn't me. 
 Anyway, what does it matter? 
 They've got what they want now. 
 'They' being? 
 Lance and Nicole. 
 Peas in a bloody pod. 
 But I'm shutting down. 
 The forest is theirs. 
 (CAR ENGINE STARTS) 
 He wouldn't have done it. 
 Ray's not like that. 
 Right. Well, thanks. 
 But Debbie might've. She wasn't above that kind of nonsense. 
 She could be a ruthless cow at times. 
 
 
 
 (BIRDS CHIRP) 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 This insulin needle that was found on the deceased - did you test it for venom? 
 Of course. It was negative. 
 But she could have been injected with the venom via one of these or something similar? 
 It's possible, but unlikely. 
 Why? 
 That needle, it's 8mm, 30/31 gauge. 
 Around the abdomen, the scar tissue is consistent with regular injections. 
 As you can see, many sites, and all the holes consistent with the size of the insulin needle. 
 But if one was penetrated with the venom, wouldn't the tissue swell and harden, like a bee sting? 
 The insulin scarring makes it impossible to differentiate. 
 Wait. 
 OK. There is one which is slightly bigger than the others, maybe a 16? 
 18 gauge. 
 I will need to re-examine the body. 
 You do that. 
 Katipo delivers a fatal bite - front page. 
 How the hell did that get out? 
 Cushla at the Brokenwood Courier won't reveal her source. 
 Chandra won't be pleased. 
 Especially as it's not technically true. 
 Debbie was injected, if not with something like this, then with a needle of some kind. 
 Someone planted the spider to hide the fact that the venom had been administered. 
 They must have known she was a diabetic. 
 And had access to needles. 
 Perhaps a fellow diabetic. 
 But also someone who had access to spiders. 
 Chandra Singh, of course. 
 What about her partner, Byron? 
 Unlikely. He's a kindred spirit of yours. 
 Meaning? 
 Byron has a thing about spiders. 
 I don't have a thing. 
 He has a thing. 
 You didn't do it. 
 Lance. 
 You said you'd sign over the permit. 
 Yes, I did say that. 
 But you didn't. I've got a group booked for 3pm. 
 But then as I was driving to the council, with the words of Detective Sims ringing in my ears of you accusing me of tampering with your precious bloody bikes, I thought, 'Bugger you'. 
 I'm not handing you anything on a plate. 
 Well, didn't you? 
 No, I did not. 
 But you know who did. 
 Do I? 
 Sign the bloody form. 
 When you retract your accusation. 
 Call Detective Sims and tell her you had it wrong. 
 (MUSIC PLAYS QUIETLY) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Kristin Sims. 
 Yeah, this is Lance Gifford. 
 Lance. 
 I just wanted to say that I'm not 100% sure it was Ray Neilson who buggered my bikes. 
 Right. Well, you did say you had no proof. 
 Yeah, that's right - I didn't. 
 But all I know is someone did. 
 Well, if you do find out anything more substantial and want to - 
 OK. Thanks. 
 (PHONE KEYPAD BEEPS) 
 Happy? 
 Having just lost my wife, 'happy' isn't a word that springs to mind. 
 Vindicated will do. 
 (MUSIC PLAYS QUIETLY) 
 (PAPER RUSTLES) 
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) 
 Do they know what really killed her? 
 What do you mean? 
 The mean-spirited attitude you both had. 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 How many people have you pissed off in recent months, Ray? 
 That forest was for everyone, and she had to block us all. 
 Shut it, Gifford. You can't come in here and talk crap like that. 
 What, say what I think? 
 Why not? 
 It's a free country. 
 You're an arsehole. You know that? 
 Takes one to know one, Ray. 
 (GLASS SHATTERS) 
 Get the hell out before I take your face off. 
 Alright. Just take it easy, lady. 
 This is just a little disagreement. 
 We're all done? 
 We're done. 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 So, what are we focusing on? 
 Ray Neilson said that Lance or someone on a quad bike was seen racing away from this area of the forest just prior to the discovery of Debbie's body. 
 So if they were involved, there should be tyre tracks nearby. 
 Yeah, well, given that this area has been out of bounds for months, any tracks should tie back to that quad bike. 
 Match the tread to the tyres, tyres to the bike - bingo. 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 (MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 Mike. 
 (SIGHS) Good work. Get the SOCO team up here to take a cast. 
 (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
 (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
 What have you found? 
 Not what I was expecting - horse hooves. 
 They lead in here... and out the same way. 
 Get me a specimen bag? 
 Oh. It'll need to be bigger. 
 Given that the forest is strictly off limits to horses, that dung could tell a story. 
 Woah! 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Kinda glad that was in plastic. 
 OK, and this is apparently where they filmed Mirkwood. 
 And you can see the big spider over there. 
 Lance seems to be back in business. 
 And pretty pleased about it. 
 (BIKE ENGINES REV) 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 So, this place is nice. 
 And the coffee's very good. 
 Mm. I thought we should meet off-site, because I've got something to give you that may not be appropriate at the mortuary. 
 Something? For me? 
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) 
 What is this? 
 Manure. Uh, from a horse. 
 Mike, this is horse sh1t. 
 Probably best referred to as manure. 
 Why have you brought me this? Is this a message? 
 I think so. 
 That you think my work is like horse manure. 
 No, Gina, on the contrary, I think you're so good at your job that you should be able to tell me how old this is. 
 You know how to age human remains. 
 Of course. That is my job. 
 So surely, you could tell me whether this is one day old, two days or more. 
 So this is a compliment? 
 I could send it to ESR, but that might take too long. 
 Well, then, why did you not say that? 
 Kiwi men, you are strangely romantic. 
 Romantic? 
 I'll get to work. 
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) 
 Chandra, hi. 
 Look at what they've written. 
 It's not true! 
 I know. 
 Did you tell them this? 
 No. We're not sure how they found out, but it's not altogether untrue. 
 Spider venom was the cause of death. 
 No Latrodectus katipo is capable of 10 times the lethal dose - 
 I told you that. 
 Well, the how is still unclear. 
 Now there'll be a witch hunt going on, people out on the dunes wreaking vengeance on innocent spiders. 
 Have you seen evidence of this? 
 It's only a matter of time. 
 I demand police protection. 
 Of the spiders? 
 Well, why not? 
 I don't think that's actually possible. 
 Unless DC Breen was free to stand guard. 
 Should any unusual activity take place, you let us know. 
 But until then it's only a perceived concern, not an actual threat. 
 They will come. You mark my words. 
 Keep in touch. 
 This is so unfair. 
 You know the other thing that will happen? 
 Spider bites will increase. 
 (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) 
 (HORSE SNORTS) 
 (CAR ENGINE REVS) 
 Big day at the office. 
 Yep, happy customers. 
 You don't think your, uh, hijinks in the forest are a bit insensitive? 
 To who? 
 Ray Neilson. Exploiting his props. 
 It's fair game. If he wants to leave his rubbish out there, I'll use it. 
 Given his circumstances, he's hardly had time to pack up his business. 
 Look, I'm just trying to make an honest buck. 
 He and Debbie had that place to themselves for too long. 
 I'm just reclaiming what's rightfully mine to use. 
 Was that Nicole Davis riding away? 
 Yep. 
 Just passing by? 
 She just dropped off some more brochures 'cause I was running low. 
 On the morning that Debbie was found dead, are you sure you weren't riding through Brokenwood Forest? 
 I told you - my bikes were stuffed. 
 Ray's adamant he saw you, backed up by his offsider Nigel. 
 Well, they're mistaken, end of story. 
 You wouldn't happen to know who owns one of these close by? 
 Every farmer, orcharder, surf lifesaver has one. 
 It was a red quad bike, if that's of any help. 
 Mate, they're just about all red. 
 Do you mind? 
 Where'd you get that? 
 Mirklewood. 
 It's trail pattern. 
 Cross-ply 25-by-10-12s. 
 This is pretty standard issue for every quad bike off the shop floor, so good luck with that. 
 Happy cleaning. 
 (MOODY MUSIC) 
 I want to see the ginger man. 
 He's very busy right now, sir. 
 This is of the utmost importance. 
 Can I help? 
 This gentleman wants to follow up on his complaint. 
 I do not understand why you will not take me seriously. 
 Mr Zeigler, come through. 
 The tour you went on actually broke no laws. 
 Nonsense. 
 We've spoken with the lawyer who set up the company, and due to the spelling of the word Ringz with a 'Z', it meant you were partaking in a tour of a film that didn't really exist. 
 Oh, I agree - Lord of the Rings with an 'S' was never filmed around Brokenwood. 
 So it's illegal? 
 No. 
 Because a trilogy of films called Lord of the Ringz with a 'Z' may have been. 
 Possibly an obscure franchise, straight to DVD. 
 People pay you to come up with this? 
 Ah, as much as I'd like to claim it as my own, I can't. 
 Mirklewood, Rivendella, Mt Doomed,... 
 Helmets Deep. 
 All in all, seems pretty legal to me. 
 This is technical. 
 Technically legal, according to his lawyer. 
 But misleading. 
 It could be seen that way, I agree. 
 And dangerous. 
 One minute, we are taking photos; the next, we are almost killed by a madman on a motorbike. 
 We're aware of that. 
 And what about the lunch? 
 He said there would be soup, and I got burgers. 
 Soup, burgers - the point is you were fed. 
 The point is, I was misled, and you won't do anything about it. 
 I can't. 
 What do you call this Mickey Mouse House of a town? 
 Brokenwood. It's called Brokenwood.

 He's at church.

 I wouldn't know. 
 Which church? 
 St Judas on Dunphy's Rise. 
 Thanks. 
 Um, did many people know that Debbie was a diabetic? 
 Was she? 
 You mean, you weren't aware of that? 
 Should I have been? 
 I just thought that as Ray's sister, you might have... 
 Debbie and I weren't close. 
 If she had medical issues, I guess she kept them to herself. 
 Right. Well, I'll head up to St Judas. 
 Um, you hold the liquor licence for the Frog and Cheetah? 
 I do. 
 What happened to Ray's? 
 It's been temporarily suspended. 
 Oh, so that's why you're here. 
 I thought it was because of Debbie. 
 Two birds with one stone. 
 So, why was it suspended? 
 Ray got himself into an altercation with the licencing inspector. 
 He flies off the handle sometimes. 
 But he'll be cleared. 
 He wasn't in the wrong - the inspector's an uptight moron. 
 There's nothing to see here, detective. Ray's a good man.

 You stood me up again, Ray. 
 Sorry. Have a lot going on - funeral arrangements. 
 On that note, when will Debbie be made available for us to do what we do? 
 As soon as the coroner releases the body. 
 A spider bite, I believe. 
 A terrible thing. 
 Rubbish. It was a diabetic coma. 
 Spider venom was found in her system, Ray. 
 The scientists don't always get it right. 
 I see. 
 There may yet be further toxicology tests to be done. 
 To tell them what I already know. 
 Well, what you know, Ray, we'd like to know too. 
 So your witness statement would be incredibly helpful. 
 Yes, yes. 
 Now? Would that be OK? 
 I'll meet you at the station. 
 Thanks again, reverend. 
 You're most welcome, Ray. 
 Such a tragedy, losing his wife. 
 Indeed. 
 Especially with the tours going so well. 
 The Lord of the Ringz? 
 Enterprise is good for the local economy. 
 But somewhat dishonest. 
 There's nothing wrong with a little suspension of disbelief and role playing, especially with such a marvellous story. 
 Regardless, the movie wasn't actually filmed in Brokenwood.

 Sorry, Ray - uh, one more question. 
 Uh, you said you saw Lance Gifford on his quad bike. 
 Like I said, he nearly took us out in the van. 
 Yeah, Lance denies it. 
 Well, he would - he shouldn't have been there. 
 Gifford, ya mad b*st*rd! 
 I have him on my phone.

 I don't see anything resembling what you describe.

 Bloody hell. The camera's bung. 
 You must have had it on selfie mode. 
 It was him, I tell you. 
 Ray, did Debbie have life insurance? 
 No. We didn't believe in it. 
 The Frog &amp; Cheetah is my life's work and my life's insurance. 
 Which is in Debbie's name. 
 For accountancy purposes. 
 So the ownership of the Frog &amp; Cheetah reverts to you once Debbie is dead? 
 Of course. Because she's my wife. 
 Who has been murdered. 
 What are you saying? 
 Debbie was murdered, Ray. 
 How? 
 The effects of spider venom. 
 Nonsense. She was a diabetic. 
 It's all there in the toxicology report. 
 For Debbie to have received 10 times the lethal dose of a spider bite, it can only have happened deliberately. 
 Well, who would do that? 
 That's what we're trying to find out. 
 She was a bloody good woman just trying to get us ahead. 
 Everyone loved Debbie. 
 Come on, Ray. 
 Your tourism business rubbed a few people up the wrong way - 
 I mean, Nicole Davis, Lance Gifford. 
 And jealousy is ugly. 
 What can I say? 
 Have you talked to him about the threatening notes? 
 What notes? 
 Here's another one - 
 'What you are doing in the forest is immoral. Cease and desist. You have been warned.' 
 (SCOFFS) Bloody Lance. 
 Why didn't you report it? 
 We thought it was just a bit of business rough and tumble. 
 Have you still got the notes? 
 We have cleaners, you know. 
 And you're sure it was Lance? 
 No. 
 Because? Because Debbie wasn't universally liked, was she, Ray? 
 So it could've been a number of people. 
 That's your opinion, just like it's your opinion that it wasn't a diabetic coma. 
 It's not opinion - it's fact. 
 The pathologist is clear. 
 Debbie was injected with spider venom, and you need to be more forthcoming with reasons why someone might have done that. 
 Or what? 
 Or we might start thinking you're hiding something. 
 If I have to accept that she died from a spider bite, I will, but not that she was murdered. 
 It makes no sense. 
 (CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC) 
 Strange. He's in total denial. 
 Well, if Debbie was murdered, that would mean there's a murderer. 
 And maybe that's something Ray doesn't wanna face.

 Of course. 
 Do other people ride up there? 
 I told you - the place is off limits. 
 Debbie Neilson had a special deal with the council. 
 And other horse people adhere to that? 
 Well, better than paying a thousand-dollar fine. 
 You, uh, obviously don't have a problem with spiders. 
 What? 
 Well, some people get a bit, you know, thingy about spiders. 
 Well, I have no feelings either way. 
 There's plenty around these parts. 
 Oh. Have you ever encountered a katipo? 
 No. 
 Not even the polythene one in Mirklewood? 
 Oh, that thing is pathetic. 
 I thought you'd never been up there. 
 Oh, I've heard about it. Everyone's heard about it. It's a joke. 
 Oh. 
 These look interesting. 
 What are they for? 
 Control of ticks and intramuscular issues. That's all. 
 I'll, uh, let you get on. 
 I just wanted to be clear that this didn't belong to you. 
 Me? 
 Well, one of your horses. 
 You brought me a bag of dung. 
 Manure. We found it at the spider site. 
 I wasn't sure what to do with it. 
 Well, keep it. Put it on your garden. I got plenty. 
 I might just do that. 
 Have a good ride. 
 You know, I'm not the only person with a horse in the district. 
 Gruss Gott! Good morning. 
 Mr Zeigler. 
 Welcome. 
 Thank you. 
 Come this way. 
 You after those lessons, Mike? 
 Three days ago, Wednesday morning - were you working here? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 With Nicole? 
 Yeah, I was holding the fort. 
 So she wasn't here then? 
 Is this, like, one of those official questions? 
 Nicole's a good lady, Mike. 
 It seems that way. 
 Yeah, she was out riding. 
 Do you know where? 
 She didn't say. 
 Oh. 
 (BIRDS CHIRP) 
 Hey, what time you wanna go for that run tomorrow? 
 What run? 
 Well, you said you wanted to get fitter. 
 Did I? 
 Yeah, I'm pretty positive you did. What do you reckon? 
 Mrs Marlowe. You shouldn't have. 
 Sam. Nice to see you. 
 No, these are for Ray Neilson. 
 I always believe that flowers are the best on the third day of mourning. 
 The adrenalin's gone, and those left grieving need a bit of a pick up about then. 
 They're red and black. 
 Yes, nice and masculine, don't you think? 
 They're, um... They're the same colour as the... katipo. 
 Yes. 
 Could be a little insensitive. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. 
 It's best to talk about these things, get them out into the open. 
 It's like vaccination - a little bit of what hurts does you good. 
 Well, that's one way to look at it. Have a nice day. 
 It's especially tragic,... uh, given that Ray's first wife went the same way. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Breen. 
 Ray Neilson's first wife, Lara, was killed by a spider bite in Brazil. 
 Get me all the background you can on it, and get Ray back in. 
 Yep. 
 Why didn't you mention Lara's death? 
 Perhaps because it's none of your business. 
 Trude. Look,... 
 Lara was the love of my life. 
 This was 30 years ago. 
 Do we need to drag up bad memories? 
 It's OK. We were on our big OE, seeing the world as Kiwis do in their early 20s. 
 He wanted to go to Rio; she wanted to go to the Amazon. 
 Trude, I've got this. We argued about it. 
 She stormed off into the jungle near where we were staying, Straight into the web of a Brazilian wandering spider. 
 It bit her in the face. 
 She was dead in two hours, two excruciating hours. 
 The Brazilian wandering spider is 10 times more deadly than the katipo. 
 10 times? 
 Yes. 
 Well, you seem to know a fair bit about it. 
 When you go through something like that, you learn a lot, whether you want to or not. 
 It makes sense why you weren't keen to accept that Debbie was bitten by a spider. 
 What are the odds, eh? 
 Debbie's death is karma for Lara. 
 Don't think that, Ray. 
 Lara's death was not your fault. 
 (CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC) 
 (DOOR SHUTS) 
 Interesting. Trudy didn't say that Debbie's death wasn't Ray's fault. 
 We're going back out to Chandra Singh's. 
 Wanna come? 
 I should probably translate the rest of the Trip Advisor. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you here to stop the thugs out on the dunes? 
 Have there been some? 
 Not yet, but I know it will happen. 
 Well, let's hope not. 
 Hope's not enough. Latrodectus katipo are an endangered species, less than 2,000 left in the world. 
 Once they're gone, they're gone. 
 Do you really want that on your conscience? 
 We'll let our staff know to keep an eye on the area. 
 A police presence should be a deterrent. 
 Thank you. Now, how can I help? 
 Do you know Ray Neilson? 
 The fisherman. 
 No, he's a publican. 
 He owns the Frog &amp; Cheetah. 
 Well, he's also a fisherman. 
 We met on the beach. 
 He's a nice man. 
 He told me he'd had a bad experience with a spider once. 
 They're shy. 
 They're polite, sensitive. 
 This one's Phoebe. 
 Phoebe, meet Ray. 
 The weird thing is I was never afraid of spiders, still aren't. 
 You've gotta admire those webs. 
 Mm. 
 They're artists. 
 Others might be tempted to seek vengeance on an innocent soul like Phoebe, but not Ray. 
 Chandra, it's happened again! 
 It's still goddamn happening. 
 Oh, no, baby. 
 Can't you do something? 
 (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) 
 You've gotta do something! 
 You can't just cut off the fins and throw it back to die! 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 I've alerted the Ministry for Primary Industries about the shark incident. 
 Noel Cleland? 
 Yeah. 
 Man, if he catches the culprit, they'll be roasted in the fires of hell with extra brimstone. 
 Well it's over to them. It's more Fisheries domain than ours. 
 Uh, Ray's waiting. 
 Is Buchanan with him? 
 Mm-hm. You coming? 
 No. Let them think they can divide and conquer. 
 Gentlemen. 
 Detective. 
 Let's keep this brief, shall we? 
 My client's under a lot of strain, and he's fully cooperated with his witness statement. 
 There really must be little to discuss. 
 Chandra Singh. 
 What about her? 
 You know her. 
 I met her once or twice. 
 And you're aware of what she does? 
 Yes, I know. 
 That depends entirely on what 'does' means - she breathes, she eats, she may collect stamps in her spare time. 
 Be specific, detective. 
 Alright. 
 She's a spider scientist, Dennis. 
 An arachnologist. So? 
 And a nice girl. 
 I met her when I went fishing. 
 Can't a man go bloody fishing without being accused of murder? 
 Whoa, slow down, Ray. Right? No one's accusing anyone of murder. 
 Aren't they? Isn't that what this is all about? 
 Is it, detective? 
 Because if it is, it's a game changer on how we must proceed. 
 You think I killed Debbie. 
 But I didn't do it. It wasn't me. 
 But someone did, and we need to clarify a few things to help us focus on who that might be. 
 Such as? 
 So, you met Chandra at the beach. 
 And? Anywhere else? 
 I took some photos of her spiders. 
 Phoebe and Cindy and Anushka, if I can recall. 
 And this was inside her laboratory? 
 Come on, girls. Show me some leg - all eight of them. 
 The shots were for the model maker to construct the giant spider in Mirklewood. 
 Which is why it looks so accurate. 
 Please. It's polythene and foam. 
 From which many tourists have been delighted through terror. 
 I'm sorry, detective, are you maligning my client for being an entrepreneur? 
 For getting off his chuff and creating one of the most successful tourist operations in the country? 
 Alright, Dennis, now you're really sounding like a lawyer. 
 Which is what I am, protecting my client from leading questions and insinuation. 
 I know where you're going with this. 
 I did nothing to harm Debbie. 
 Nothing. 
 Which is probably all that needs to be said. 
 Long black, two sugars. 
 Ta. 
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) 
 Business meeting? 
 Is there a problem with that? 
 I wouldn't have thought so. 
 Unlike other operators, we can see the benefit in working together. 
 I guess there's only a certain amount of money to go around. 
 Exactly. You know, we're happy to share it. 
 I need another coffee. 
 Unfortunately, others weren't, or they may still have been in business today. 
 Meaning? 
 Well it makes you wonder, right? 
 How a crappy, poxy business like Ray's Tours could do such a great trade. 
 I mean, what else was going on up there? 
 What's the soup today? 
 Oh, it's seafood chowder. It's pretty good. 
 But you're too late, 'cause I got the last serve. 
 Fair enough. 
 Good luck, Lance. 
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) 
 (BIRDS CHIRP) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Nice car. 
 Thanks. 
 Then why aren't you driving it? 
 (SEAT BELT CLICKS) 
 Anywhere in particular? 
 No, I prefer to be moving. 
 That horse dung - it's from my horse Milly. 
 I had a hunch. 
 So you went to the spider site. To sabotage it? 
 I thought it was Lance I heard on the bike, but it didn't make sense. 
 (BIKE ENGINE REVS) 
 (DRAMATIC MUSIC) 
 (MUSIC BUILDS) 
 I panicked. 
 So, why didn't you report it? 
 I was going to, but by the time I got back, the news had already broken. 
 And I just didn't want to get involved. 
 And risk a thousand-dollar fine? 
 Horses are expensive to keep. 
 I know it was the wrong thing to do. 
 It was. 
 Did Lance know? 
 It was his idea. 
 So it was him on the quad bike, then? 
 No, I don't know who it was. 
 His bikes were stuffed, uh, thanks to Debbie and her packet of sugar. 
 That's why you were on horseback, then. 
 Yeah. 
 I presume I'll be charged with something, but it's a load off. 
 I knew you'd find out. 
 Why's that? 
 Well, word is you're good at your job. 
 I figured you'd take that dung and have it tested for DNA on my horse or something. 
 I'm flattered. 
 Actually, I was gonna put it on my garden like you suggested. 
 After I got it back from the lab. 
 I'm gonna need your statement. 
 And you're gonna need a lawyer. 
 Boss, translations of Ray's Trip Advisor fans. 
 Almost unanimous in praise for the experience, but mostly about the special lunch. 
 Ray's Tours would have to be the first NZ tour operation famous for its cuisine. 
 Debbie and Ray must've really mastered the filled roll and custard square. 
 Their MO was more than sharing the love of Hobbiton. 
 Ray visited Chandra's lab. 
 So, if Ray wanted to knock off his wife with spider venom,... he had clear access to source it. 
 Better than that. 
 You're a diabetic? 
 (SIGHS) It's such a pain. 
 My wife's diabetic. 
 Hm. 
 Which means Chandra knew about Debbie's condition. 
 And according to a friend who works in the university research department, Chandra's funding was cut off three months ago. 
 So selling the venom to the antidote producers was all that was funding her own precious research. 
 But demand is small now, supplies are replete because no one is getting bitten. 
 So she wouldn't be adverse to a little hysteria to create demand. 
 You could argue that Chandra needed the katipo to make headlines. 
 (ROCK MUSIC) 
 Not a bad effort, Mike. 
 How long was that? 
 Six and a half minutes. 
 Which given there's 23 hours and 54 minutes left in a day, leaving time for improvement, eh? 
 I'll take your word for it. 
 You seen this? 
 Yeah. Sick. 
 Ooh. You know, I think might take up horse riding after all. 
 At least you get to sit down while you're getting fit. 
 And lunch. 
 Lunch? 
 Yeah. Nicole's thinking of providing lunch for the punters. Big spread. 
 Seems it's the way to go. 
 Why? 
 Well, market pressure. 
 This vanload turned up yesterday, gave her a hard time. 
 They want the special lunch, like the Lord of the Ringz tours. 
 Maybe it would be good for business. 
 Special lunch? 
 No, not burger and chips - what you say. 
 Well, it makes you wonder all right, how a crappy, poxy business like Ray's Tours could do such a great trade. 
 So, coffee at mine? 
 No, I'll get one at the station. 
 Oh, Jared, hey, uh, thanks for the pain and suffering. 
 Mike. Have you seen the paper? 
 Yeah. 
 If Chandra is after headlines, her boyfriend is upstaging her. 
 He sure is. Get Ray Neilson back in. I'll be there in 20 minutes. 
 What were you serving your tourists for lunch, Ray? 
 Detective, menus now? Please. 
 How is any of that relevant? 
 It's completely relevant. 
 I never served them; Debbie did. 
 There you go. Not relevant. 
 Then what did Debbie serve? 
 He might not know what Debbie served. 
 It's OK. 
 Maybe it's not OK, Ray. 
 I advise you to stop - 
 On occasion when it was up to me, they got fish and chips, nothing more. 
 Nothing more from the sea? 
 No. 
 Then they weren't happy about it, were they? 
 No. 
 Not when they expected and have paid handsomely for shark fin soup, right? 
 I request some time alone with my client. 
 No, it's not necessary. 
 My client was unaware of any - 
 Stop it, Dennis. I've got this. 
 Alright, I knew about it. 
 But believe me, I detested it. 
 I refused to serve it. 
 Debs, we can't do this. 
 They've already paid for it. 
 We can't serve them that crap! It's wrong! 
 But Debbie was stubborn. 
 She believed the customer was always right. I felt it was wrong. 
 It should be noted here that serving shark fin soup is not illegal. 
 True. Which is not to say that it's not completely immoral. 
 Yes, but it is not a crime unless Ray finned the shark himself in NZ waters. 
 Which I take it you didn't do? 
 'Course I didn't bloody do that. 
 I flat-out refused to have anything to do with it. 
 I took the bookings, I drove the van, but there was no way I'd do the lunches. 
 Why didn't you mention this before? 
 Because she was my wife. 
 And even though she's passed on, you don't wanna be disloyal. 
 And any association with murder would count against me getting my liquor licence back. 
 The Frog &amp; Cheetah is everything to me. 
 Thanks, Ray. 
 Tuesday mornings. 
 At daybreak. 
 I believe she met a boat down at the wharf. 
 That's where she got the damn stuff. 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 Ray's off the hook? 
 Saddle up, Tonto. 
 Where are we going? 
 To sample some spider venom. 
 Now, that just sounds plain foolish. 
 (COUNTRY MUSIC) 
 (BRAKES SQUEAK) 
 Actually, you probably don't need all three of us. I'll scout around. 
 For? 
 Important stuff. 
 Test the vial? Why? 
 To be sure there is venom in there. 
 Of course there is - I put it there. 
 Well, we need to be certain. 
 You don't understand - there are thousands of milkings in there. 
 Even so - 
 To test the vial will destroy all of my hard work. 
 Even with Byron's help it'll take months to catch up. 
 The thing is, it may already have been destroyed. 
 Do I have a choice? 
 Hello? 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
 (BIRDS CHIRP) 
 (MUSIC BUILDS) 
 H2O and sodium chloride. 
 It's nothing but saline. 
 How could this happen? 
 That's a question better asked of Byron. 
 (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
 Another one! 
 When will it end? 
 How do you stop this? 
 I don't know. 
 But killing people is never a great solution to anything, Byron. 
 What do you mean? 
 When Ray Neilson mentioned his wife was a diabetic, it all fell into place, didn't it? 
 You're a diabetic? 
 (SIGHS) It's such a pain. 
 Mm. My wife's diabetic. 
 Mm. 
 After you'd warned Debbie several times, you decided to take it further, much further. 
 (DRAMATIC MUSIC) 
 Far from having a fear of spiders, Chandra explained that you were a great help around the lab. 
 What was your theory? 
 (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) 
 Cut off demand to stop supply. 
 (BIKE ENGINE REVS) 
 (BIRDS CHIRP) 
 Who the hell are you? 
 Are you with Lance? 
 I warned you, but you wouldn't listen. 
 No, please. I didn't know. 
 I thought it was about the bikes! 
 You're lying. 
 (SCREAMS) No! What are you doing? (SCREAMS) 
 (PANTS) 
 (WHIMPERS) 
 (WHIMPERS) 
 How could you? 
 I'm sorry, babe. 
 How could you? You monster! 
 You selfish monster! 
 OK, it's OK, Chandra. 
 Come on. Come with me. 
 Dr Byron Cotter, you're under arrest for the murder of Debbie Neilson. 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 The people who did that - they're the real criminals, right? 
 It's just another terrible way to die, Dr Cotter, no different to latrodectism. 
 Let's go. 
 You have the right to consult a lawyer... 
 (BLUES MUSIC) 
 (MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 (MUSIC FADES) 
 You don't need to tell me, but, um, how did your wife contact you after she died? 
 She gave me a shopping list... before she died. 
 It was the last thing she said before I left for work. 
 She gave me the list,... said, 'Don't forget this'. 
 Well, of course, with everything that happened, I did, completely forgot. 
 Till a couple days later when I pulled it out of my pocket. 
 And it wasn't actually a shopping list. 
 What was it? 
 It was a note saying, 'I love you'. 
 Like I said,... 
 I felt lucky. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 We may have thwarted something even more sinister, you know? 
 What's that? 
 Two scientists, one laboratory - what's to have stopped them trying to cross a katipo with a shark, creating a poisonous, eight-finned, 10-eyed great white? 
 You should worry about more tangible things, like the spider that just crawled under your lapel. 
 Seriously? 
 It's just there. 
 Lucky he doesn't have a thing about spiders, though. 
 Did I get it? Is it gone? 
 'Cause I can't see anything. 
 No, no, no, it's on your head.
