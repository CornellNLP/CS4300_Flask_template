 (UNSETTLING, CHILLING MUSIC) 
  MAN ON RECORDING: She climbed the stairs soundlessly, feeling a frisson of excitement, that was almost like a sexual pleasure as she thought of the knife about to penetrate his flesh. 
  READS: This man had used her, and now she would use him - call it target practise, call it butchery, she would cleave him head from shoulders like a log on a block and watch his life paint the walls crimson. 
  She could feel her cheeks burning. 
  She could see his shadow. 
  Is your jam - chicks offing guys for sport? 
  Well the perpetrator isn't always female. 
  He's an equal-opportunity author. 
  Yeah, I've read him. 
  Don't think much of his style. 
  Well you wait til you see him. 
  Oh, Christ, we are so late. 
  You could turn the sirens on. 
  (SCOFFS QUIETLY) 
  She could see his shadow on the wall - his long legs, his mane of hair, those shoulders, mm, the back she had clung to in raptures, the neck she dreamed of kissing Heart thudding like a hammer, she spoke his name softly. 
  He turned (CLEARS THROAT) 
  Sorry, if we could pause there. 
  Oh God, don't stop! 
  Sony, I'm a little dry. 
  Speak for yourself. 
  Perhaps we could? 
  Of course. 
  Let's take a break. 
  After which I'll be sure to satisfy you completely. 
  If I could have some help with the supper? 
  Can I? 
  Thank you. 
  Come on. 
  We're missing the reading. 
  Well, you really should have put these in a tin. 
  It's bring a plate. 
  Book club rules, apparently. 
  This is so your first time, right? 
  Oh God, just give it here. 
  Oh sh-! 
  (PLATE CLATTERS) 
  And that's why. 
  Oh my God. 
  Three-second rule? 
  Yes! 
  Quick. 
  OK. 
  No sausage roll shall be left behind. 
  (GROANS) 
  I hope they have more sauce inside. 
  Oh. 
  Sony. 
  This is the guy? 
  Mm. . 
  It doesn't really do him any justice. 
  Man, you've got it bad, eh? 
  I just really like his books. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Yeah, all right. 
  Come on. 
  His books. 
  Has he started? 
  Um, we only just got here. 
  My sausage rolls took forever. 
  Glad we're not the only late ones. 
  I'm not late. 
  The reading started over half an hour ago. 
  I don't want to hear him read. 
  I just want to see him. 
  You've got the hots for this guy too? 
  Hots? 
  No. 
  A bone to pick, yes. 
  What sort of a bone? 
  We should go in. 
  Yeah. 
  The major hots. 
  I hope he's signing books. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Damn. 
  We've missed it. 
  Only a wonderful first half. 
  It's supper break. 
  Oh, good. 
  These just wouldn't crisp. 
  Did you use an egg wash? 
  No. 
  Oh, absolutely essential. 
  Oh. 
  I might heat these up a bit. 
  They get really claggy when they're cold. 
  Great cheese rolls, Mrs M. 
  Thank you, Jared. 
  They're always a popular item. 
  Great kai indeed. 
  How was the reading? 
  He was hamming it up a bit. 
  Oh. 
  Are you a fan? 
  Excuse me. 
  I might just go and hunt down a cup of tea. 
  Oops! 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Taxi. 
  Are you insinuating something? 
  It was a joke, Maxine. 
  I don't see the funny side. 
  Maybe it'll come to you. 
  Well, if you don't get it the first time, how funny is it? 
  Ooh! 
  You made those? 
  My mother's recipe. 
  I might like to note that. 
  Mmm! 
  They're very good. 
  I can vouch for that. 
  Hey, um, I'm gonna shoot through. 
  Oh, no, he's reading again after supper. 
  I'm good. 
  I reckon he's a bit over-rated. 
  Give me Jane Austen any day. 
  (WOMEN SCREAMING) 
  (THUDDING, WOMEN SCREAM) 
  Everyone stay where you are. 
  (TENSE MUSIC) 
  (OMINOUS MUSIC) 
  (WOMAN SCREAMS) 
  I need everyone to remain in this room. 
  We have a team on their way. 
  Can I make a cup of tea for Petra? 
  She's had a nasty shock. 
  No, I can't have everybody moving around a crime scene. 
  Thanks for holding the fort. 
  He's on the stairs. 
  Get the area cordoned off. 
  Who found him? 
  You know her. 
  She has a corgi. 
  My ex-wife is part of a book club? 
  That's a new one. 
  Part of her fresh start, maybe? 
  It's part of something no doubt. 
  Get talking. 
  I'm gonna have a chat with the author. 
  Hey. 
  This could take some time and I was thinking Uh, yeah. 
  Take off while you can. 
  Love your work. 
  Why is he allowed to leave? 
  Because he was with me the whole time and he's not a suspect. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  And we are? 
  Well it's just procedure. 
  We need to know where everybody else was. 
  What they saw, what they heard. 
  Are there any other spaces we can use, just to give people some privacy? 
  Well there's the kitchen. 
  And the special nook. 
  Right. 
  You use the hall, I'll take the kitchen and Mike can have the nook. 
  Can I have the kitchen? 
  You know you can't eat the food, right? 
  Yeah, but I can just look at it. 
  Yeah, no. 
  You talk to the girl first. 
  She looks like she needs to go home. 
  Why am I being contained here? 
  We arrived together, I did not leave this room. 
  I am missing a valuable opportunity to examine a fresh corpse. 
  The man's hardly cold. 
  This is my point. 
  Yeah, you go. 
  So, what's your story, Jack? 
  Stabbed in the back. 
  Someone's sending a message here - betrayal? 
  Revenge. 
  Someone's idea of a joke. 
  Knife In The Back - this is the title of his latest book, and this is how the victim dies. 
  Someone's recreating it? 
  Exactly. 
  So who done it in the whodunit? 
  I mean, that is not a line of enquiry you should follow. 
  The book is fiction. 
  Nonetheless A deranged pathologist commits the murder. 
  Ah. 
  She is cold, clinical. 
  In my view, an unconvincing character. 
  I'm sorry. 
  (SNIFFLES) 
  I'm devastated. 
  I invited Jack to come here. 
  (SNIFFLES) 
  Did you know him well? 
  We only met five days ago, but we connected before that. 
  I reached out to him about doing a reading. 
  I was lucky to get him - superstars like Jack do international festivals. 
  They don't do small-town bookshops like this. 
  But he did for you? 
  I made it worth his while. 
  You offered him a fee? 
  Of course. 
  I paid for everything. 
  Airfares, accommodation That must have come tom? 
  Oh, money wasn't the issue. 
  I divorced well. 
  I can afford to indulge my passion, which is books, and the amazing people who write them. 
  So I didn't stint to get Jack - First Class travel, a very luxurious Airbnb. 
  (SNIFFLES) 
  Well, you must have really wanted him. 
  I did. 
  Easy on the wine. 
  You've had a shock. 
  Yeah, I'm shattered. 
  It's not every day you trip over a dead guy. 
  Why did you go upstairs? 
  To find a loo. 
  And instead you found I still can't quite believe it. 
  I mean an hour ago, he was alive. 
  Radiating this magnetic energy and Did you know him at all before tonight? 
  By reputation. 
  I've read his books. 
  Never met him, though? 
  Maxine was over the moon when she scored him. 
  She's talked about nothing else for the last few weeks. 
  I'm wiped out. 
  Are we done? 
  For now. 
  OK. 
  We might need to get a DNA sample. 
  (CHAIR SCRAPES) 
  (CHUCKLES BREATHILY) 
  You rig ht? 
  Yeah. 
  Uh, why? 
  You found the body. 
  There'll be traces of you at the scene. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  And you need to, what, eliminate me? 
  That's right. 
  Mike, we were married for two years. 
  You really think I'd stab a man in the back? 
  Petra, this is a murder investigation. 
  It's not personal. 
  Married to the job - same old, same old. 
  (SIGHS) 
  That's all we need for now. 
  Have you filled in your details? 
  And you've got a ride home? 
  Mr Drake is taking me. 
  My contact details are on the form and IÃ¢m at the high school. 
  All good. 
  Sir, could we have a few words? 
  Finally. 
  Excuse me, is that yours? 
  (STAMMERS) 
  No. 
  It belonged to the author. 
  Or should I say the deceased. 
  Oh, well, in that case please don't touch it. 
  Can you bag that? 
  For all we know, it could contain a vital clue to the killer's identity! 
  Mm. 
  Yes. 
  They're not bad, these. 
  Wish I could. 
  Go on. 
  Your secret will be safe with me. 
  We don't eat on the job. 
  You fill your boots, though. 
  Is this gonna take long? 
  Doesn't have to. 
  Full name? 
  Kenneth Lowell Carnaby. 
  I go by KL for my pen name. 
  Oh, you're an author? 
  Not as well-known as tonight's guest, obviously. 
  Do you write crime too? 
  Literary fiction. 
  And, of course, I teach. 
  I taught this fellow. 
  Not my most talented student, but this has been on the New York Times Best Seller list for weeks. 
  Utter drivel. 
  Why did you buy one, then? 
  To see if he would have the gall to sign it. 
  And did he? 
  Mm. 
  Fortunately, yes. 
  I'll make thousands from that now. 
  You, uh, didn't like this guy, did you? 
  I thought you said this was gonna be quick. 
  I hope you told the truth. 
  You're drunk. 
  And you're a tramp. 
  You are way out of line. 
  Oh, you couldn't wait to come sniffing around. 
  I paid for that place. 
  I don't know what you're talking about. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  Don't play the innocent. 
  All right. 
  Let's keep things civil. 
  Is everything all right? 
  We've got everything we need for tonight. 
  Thank you. 
  We'll be in touch. 
  Don't let her drive. 
  She's tanked. 
  Yeah, well, you're not exactly sober. 
  Yeah, well, I'm not driving. 
  My fiance's picking me up. 
  Fiance? 
  Yeah, we met at that music festival. 
  - When I was looking after your dog? 
  - (CAR APPROACHES, HORN BLARES) 
  He's an Artisan Cheese maker. 
  You'd have to be barking mad to marry that woman. 
  She's got the morals of an alley cat. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  Engaged to be married and she's busy rutting Jack? 
  Uh, when was this? 
  Oh, did she not mention it? 
  Is this hearsay or? 
  They were seen. 
  By? 
  This person gave me the information in confidence, but 100% reliable. 
  Breen, could you drive Ms Holst home? 
  Sure, boss. 
  I'll make a statement. 
  Happy to. 
  (PENSIVE MUSIC) 
  Did that come as a surprise? 
  If it's true, Petra lied to my face. 
  And the answer to the million dollar question - what does a famous author keep in his bag, is Yeah, Reverend Greene was really keen on something in there. 
  Our man was traveling light - laptop and condoms. 
  Oh. 
  OK, clearly he was expecting a busy night. 
  More so than a knife in the back, I guess. 
  OK, let's start with the weapon - distinctive, bone handle. 
  Did you tell me that the bookshop owner, Maxine Holst, admits that it was hers. 
  Mm-hm. 
  She believes it was on a side table upstairs. 
  So let's start with who you saw entering and leaving the main room. 
  OK. 
  Mrs Marlowe entered; KL whatshisface entered; Reverend Greene exited; Maxine entered; and Petra exited. 
  I'm just not sure about these two. 
  I didn't get much out of her last night. 
  She could barely talk. 
  I'll do a follow up. 
  Get anything on next of kin? 
  Parents dead, and there's a brother in Canada, who's about to become very wealthy. 
  If he'd left it all to next of kin. 
  How rich is he? 
  Oh, loaded. 
  A string of best-sellers, movie adaptation in the works So money is a possible motive? 
  One of them. 
  We've got several suspects with connections - Carnaby used to be his teacher, and Petra was possibly intimate with him. 
  Possibly? 
  Well at this stage, it's only hearsay. 
  So you'll be doing a follow up with Yeah. 
  Breen, do a deep dive into his laptop - Google searches, emails. 
  And, Kristin, check out where he was staying. 
  (ROLLICKING MUSIC) 
  Oh no. 
  Wait! 
  Don't touch anything! 
  Sorry, I didn't know anyone was booked in. 
  I'm not a client, IÃ¢Âm CIB. 
  Can I get your name? 
  Toni Morris. 
  Morris. 
  Have you got a daughter? 
  Yeah. 
  Lindy. 
  So you know what happened last night? 
  Yeah, poor kid's pretty shocked. 
  Then you can understand that this is a place of interest to police. 
  Please don't touch or move anything. 
  Yeah, sorry, I didn't think. 
  Maxine told me to clean it, so This is Maxine Holst? 
  Yeah. 
  She made the booking. 
  She rang me this morning. 
  Didn't exactly pick up after himself, did he? 
  (SCOFFS) 
  Rich people are the worst. 
  Is this your place? 
  Ha! 
  I just manage it. 
  The owner lives overseas. 
  He doesn't rent it out often. 
  It's 2 grand a night. 
  2 grand?! 
  Yeah. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  My van cost that much. 
  How many nights was he booked in for? 
  Couple of weeks. 
  Wow, that's quite an investment. 
  Mm. 
  Has Maxine rented this place out for other visiting authors? 
  Hell no. 
  She went the extra mile for this one. 
  She was all over it - tizzing around, like she was setting up for a honeymoon. 
  Use these. 
  Egyptian cotton. 
  They're mine. 
  The place needs to be immaculate. 
  And the service needs to be invisible. 
  He's a writer, so he can't be disturbed. 
  OK. 
  You must check with me before any cleans - no casual visits. 
  You think she had romantic expectations? 
  Well, yeah. 
  Anyway, I'll leave you to it. 
  Just lock up when you're done. 
  You have a key? 
  There's a lock-box outside. 
  The code's 25-12. 
  (INTRIGUING, TENSE MUSIC) 
  Well, Jack, you're a get-around guy. 
  I do not want to look at this face any longer. 
  What have you got for me? 
  No surprises. 
  The 6-inch paper knife found in the body caused the death. 
  And Fingerprints said that the knife was wiped clean - again, no surprises. 
  Does the wound tell us anything? 
  Angle of entry suggests two things - either the killer was taller than this man or he had already started to descend the stairs when he was struck. 
  Both are possible. 
  So the offender was either tall or short. 
  Or in between, yes. 
  Oh. 
  Just one stab wound? 
  Correct. 
  The killer was forceful. 
  This knife is not sharp, but it was plunged in so deeply it severed the carotid anew. 
  Though not much blood at the scene. 
  The bleeding was internal. 
  Hardly anything on the rug. 
  It has a busy pattern, forgiving of small stains. 
  It will not need cleaning. 
  I'll pass that on. 
  Time of death? 
  If supper break commenced shortly after 8pm and the body was found at 834 A 30-minute window. 
  If you have motive, opportunity, and a weapon is to hand that's plenty of time. 
  (CELL PHONE RINGS) 
  Sims. 
  At Rudd's love shack I found a few things, including a pair of women's underwear. 
  I don't suppose there's a name tag in them? 
  And there's more - two champagne flutes, one with lipstick, both with prints, and the lab's got a match on them already. 
  One's Rudd And the other's Petra? 
  Affirmative. 
  Do you want me to handle this? 
  (SIGHS) 
  No. 
  Leave it with me. 
  Copy that. 
  (KEYPAD BEEPS, LINE RINGS) 
  Petra. 
  Yeah, Mike. 
  Can we meet up? 
  Are these yours? 
  No. 
  Not my size, my colour, or my style. 
  I like a thong, as you know. 
  Can I go now? 
  Not quite. 
  Your fingerprints were found on a glass in Jack Rudd's bedroom. 
  Can you explain that? 
  I paid him a visit. 
  Any particular reason? 
  To discuss literature. 
  I need a straight answer, Petra. 
  What were you doing in Jack Rudd's bedroom? 
  All right! 
  I shagged him. 
  (SIGHS) 
  So why did you lie to me? 
  I don't want anything getting back to my fiance. 
  It would hurt him. 
  Jesus, are you sure about this marriage? 
  You've only just met the guy. 
  All right, it's impulsive, but you know when you feel it, right? 
  Sure, but people usually wait until after the wedding before they start cheating. 
  Don't make this about us. 
  I'm not proud of myself, but Jack was you don't meet guys like that every day. 
  So when did you meet him'? 
  A few days ago, at my fiance's restaurant. 
  It's attached to the workshop. 
  And Jack was having lunch in the garden. 
  He looks good in his jacket photos, but in the flesh Excuse me. 
  I know who you are. 
  I have no idea who you are, but I'd love to find out. 
  What are you doing? 
  What, now? 
  Yeah. 
  Right now. 
  I know it sounds bad, but I knew that Jack wasn't here for long so I thought, well, so long as no one knows, then what harm does it do? 
  You don't change, do you? 
  Neither do you. 
  Look at this car. 
  Don't judge me, Mike. 
  I know IÃ¢Âm not perfect, but I never killed anyone. 
  Petra says these don't belong to her. 
  And you believe her? 
  She copped to everything else. 
  So she did shag him? 
  More than once. 
  Well, no wonder Maxine was so septic. 
  Petra did suggest that those might belong to her. 
  Perhaps you could have that conversation? 
  Well they are Maxine's price point. 
  Less costs more, right? 
  Well, they're not priced by the yard, Mike. 
  How's the computer trawl going'? 
  Interesting. 
  I followed up on the will - pretty standard, next of kin - that's hot - but there's a big lawsuit brewing. 
  Guess who was trying to sue Jack Rudd for a cool million? 
  This guy. 
  - (INTRIGUING MUSIC) 
  Could I have a few words? 
  Your colleague said I was allowed to re-open. 
  Is there a problem? 
  No. 
  So long as no one goes up the stairs. 
  We've had rubberneckers outside all morning, of course, wanting to see where it happened. 
  Sadly, it's been quite good for business. 
  Well, I won't hold you up. 
  Do you know who these belong to? 
  Those are mine. 
  Well, then you probably know, they were found in Jack Rudd's bedroom. 
  Well, that's not evidence of anything. 
  No, but it does indicate a sexual relationship. 
  I'm aware of how it looks, but I can assure you that our connection was well established before we met. 
  This was not a cheap hook-up. 
  And how would you describe the relationship? 
  It started professionally, as a correspondence. 
  I contacted Jack's publisher about a personal appearance, and Jack responded. 
  How did he respond? 
  Warmly. 
  We started e-mailing, and things quickly developed into something more personal. 
  Not at my instigation. 
  He was keen to come. 
  He also said he was single, and finding it lonely. 
  So he invited a relationship? 
  Why else would he have said that? 
  So, I arranged everything, and he came, and it was perfect. 
  We had dinner together on his first night, we drank champagne, went back to his place, we talked It was a deep soul connection. 
  And then he changed. 
  The next day he summoned me he was brusque. 
  Who's been in here? 
  Things are missing. 
  What things? 
  Personal stuff - my watch, my shaver I'm so sorry. 
  I don't know how that happened, but I can replace everything. 
  I'll do it tomorrow. 
  (LAUGHS DISMISSIVELY) 
  You think you can buy a Rolex in this town? 
  Well, the shaver anyway. 
  And I'll reimburse you for the watch. 
  It was a gift. 
  It was engraved. 
  Jack, I'm mortified. 
  I was clear about my needs - security and privacy. 
  Of course. 
  Can you make sure no one else gets in here? 
  And when you do bring the shaver, leave it outside. 
  I'm writing. 
  I can't be disturbed. 
  But he wasn't writing. 
  He was out and about, seen everywhere - drinks, dinners Who did he have dinner with? 
  Reverend Greene. 
  I know. 
  Did you spring for the watch? 
  Well, I felt responsible. 
  And I really thought That you had a future with him. 
  (SNIFFLES) 
  That's what he led me to believe. 
  Definitely. 
  And that's how he behaved (VOICE BREAKS) 
  until (SNIFFLES) 
  until he found other options, and I became disposable. 
  Ah. 
  Afternoon. 
  Beautiful place. 
  Yes, ifs lovely, isn't it'? 
  Sadly it's not mine. 
  Shall we go and talk in the hut. 
  That way I'll feel at least like I'm working. 
  Why were you suing Rudd? 
  He stole from me. 
  Must've been something valuable. 
  Yeah, a plot. 
  It was the best one I ever concocted and he stole it- lock, stock and barrel. 
  HOW? 
  Well, he was doing a Masters in Creative Writing - the course I run. 
  His portfolio was weak, you know. 
  It was pretentious and derivative. 
  The star that year was Hamish Drake. 
  The teacher? 
  Yeah, at your local high school. 
  Never did climb the heights, but he could've. 
  Anyway, they were both part of my tutorial group. 
  And IÃ¢Âd just come up with this plot, and I knew it was good and I wanted to use it to illustrate a point. 
  Sol laid it out for them - the whole thing. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I have to admit, I was quite proud of it. 
  So you can imagine my surprise when Jack Rudd's first novel was published nine months later, and there it was - my plot. 
  Every detail. 
  Straight steal. 
  Why go after him now? 
  He sold the movie rights to a major studio. 
  That's like striking gold. 
  And here am I, approaching retirement, and all I really wanted was a share of what was rightfully mine. 
  So you hired a lawyer? 
  Well, I thought we could deal with it like gentlemen, so I took him out for lunch. 
  A percentage of the rights' payment, and a credit. 
  That's all I'm after. 
  Saying what? 
  'Original story by'. 
  It could even be a shared credit. 
  (SCOFFS, CHUCKLES) 
  Why would I give you that? 
  It's my due. 
  Kenneth, your books don't sell. 
  They're boring. 
  I took your straw and I spun it into gold. 
  So you admit you took from me? 
  A few details, the basic shape. 
  It was wholesale theft. 
  Try and prove it. 
  I've got deeper pockets than you. 
  You won't win. 
  Why can't you just do the decent thing? 
  Cos I don't feel like it. 
  I ripped you off. 
  Boo hoo. 
  What are you gonna do about it'? 
  I'll see you in court, Jack. 
  I don't think so. 
  Nice try, old man. 
  You must've been angry that he second guessed you. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I suppose you're looking for a motive, Detective? 
  Of course. 
  We have to ask - who had reason to want Jack Rudd dead? 
  He was more use to me alive, actually. 
  Although I suppose I could still sue the estate. 
  It's all going to a brother in Canada. 
  Really? 
  What, no wives? 
  Ex-wives? 
  Rudd was a rolling stone. 
  Gathered no moss. 
  He was a phony and a failure. 
  At the end of the day, Jack Rudd got what he deserved. 
  It was just a friendly gesture - a simple home-cooked meal. 
  And is this a gesture you generally extend to visiting authors? 
  As it happens, no. 
  So, why this author? 
  I enjoy murder mysteries. 
  It was a chance to spend time with a master of the form - perhaps glean a few tips. 
  And was it enlightening? 
  Not really. 
  He was a disappointing conversationalist. 
  A good story doesn't need flowery language, it simply needs attractive people wanting to have s*x, having s*x or thinking about having s*x. 
  Then you throw in a murder, and hey presto. 
  Ungenerous. 
  I barely got a word in all night. 
  I'd gone to quite some trouble, and he left before the pudding course. 
  Mrs Marlowe made a gooseberry fool especially. 
  Perhaps it was presumptuous of me to impose on him. 
  He's an internationally celebrated author, and I'm nobody, really. 
  Nevertheless, I was hopeful. 
  What were you hoping for? 
  More than I got. 
  You seemed very interested in the author's satchel. 
  Did I? 
  Mm. . 
  I had to ask you not to touch it. 
  (SIGHS) 
  I I was (SIGHS) 
  (STAMMERS) 
  I was just I'd lent him something. 
  I wanted it returned. 
  What did you lend him? 
  IÃ¢Âd rather not say. 
  (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) 
  Where do you want these? 
  Oh, wherever. 
  Anywhere you think. 
  I've got quite a lot to be getting on with, so if you don't mind Of course. 
  It's very distressing, this whole affair. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Detective. 
  Yes, hello. 
  I might be able to shed a little light on that dinner at the manse. 
  Oh. 
  Were you there all night? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Well, the Reverend couldn't put together a three-course meal. 
  So you did all the cooking? 
  And the washing up. 
  I was quite prepared to serve at table as well, but the Reverend put his foot down about that. 
  He told me in no uncertain terms I was not to disturb them. 
  He wanted to be alone with that man Rudd. 
  What, do you know why? 
  Well, he's very attractive. 
  I am broad-minded, you know. 
  I have nothing against homosexualists. 
  Are you serious? 
  Rudd scored the Rev as well? 
  The guy was barely here a week! 
  And on the seventh day, he rested. 
  It's only supposition, but there's definitely something Reverend Greene isn't telling us. 
  He had hopes, he was disappointed, which is Maxine's story too. 
  And Carnaby's. 
  There's definitely a theme emerging. 
  The guy was a user. 
  Petra didn't feel used. 
  She gave Rudd a glowing report. 
  Are you, like, a bit jealous? 
  On the contrary - I'm remembering why I walked away. 
  So at least three suspects have motive. 
  Maxine, Carnaby and even Reverend Greene have a score to settle. 
  This Hamish Drake has history with Rudd too. 
  Yeah, I'm seeing him tomorrow. 
  I still can't get my head around Rudd and Reverend Greene. 
  Something seems off. 
  Yeah, but if you'd seen him. 
  He was acting like a jilted lover. 
  Breen, here you go. 
  Attempted break-in at the Airbnb Love Nest. 
  They're holding the suspect on site. 
  (INTRIGUING MUSIC) 
  It could be the same person who took the watch and shaver. 
  Back for more loot. 
  Risky. 
  Not to mention stalker-y. 
  I just want to get it back - the thing that I gave him. 
  Is it a valuable item? 
  I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I wonder if you would do me a very great favour. 
  What kind of favour? 
  Would you read this? 
  It's a novel. 
  I wrote it myself. 
  I see that. 
  It's a murder mystery - just an amateur's attempt, but I thought, as a master of the craft, you might have a few pointers to offer. 
  (SIGHS) 
  There's a lot of reading here. 
  Am I asking too much? 
  No, no, of course not. 
  But if I'm gonna do your work justice, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut the evening short. 
  Oh, must you? 
  I don't see how else I'll get through. 
  No, no, I wasn't expecting an instant answer. 
  I'll start tonight. 
  He assured me I'd hear from him very soon, and I didn't. 
  Yeah, well, he had a very hectic schedule while he was here. 
  Yes, I learned that. 
  Days went by. 
  Not a word from him. 
  I started to get anxious, so I paid him a call, hoping to find him (MAN AND WOMAN LAUGH LOUDLY) 
  And I did. 
  JACK: Wait, there's more. 
  But he wasn't alone. 
  'He became aware of the urgent throbbing pulse of the organ. 
  'Were the dead man's fingers playing?' WOMAN: On his organ? 
  'He stiffened. 
  ' Oh, stop it! 
  (LAUGHS) 
  It says it right there. 
  'An icy chill pervading his loins. 
  ' I never knew loins could be pervaded. 
  Oh, but they can (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) 
  That was my only copy - the work of years. 
  I could never re-write it. 
  We did a thorough search of the premises. 
  There's nothing there. 
  And ifs not in his bag? 
  If it does tum up, we'll make sure it's returned to you. 
  That's all I want. 
  So we didn't charge him. 
  A budding author - who knew? 
  Who writes a novel by hand and doesn't make a copy? 
  A sensitive rural clergyman. 
  I think we can discount him as the offender. 
  And he says he didn't nick the watch or shaver either. 
  So who did? 
  Well, Breen has a theory. 
  Rudd had fans, right? 
  Obsessive fans. 
  There's reams of it online. 
  Did they contact him directly? 
  Oh, yeah, and he gets back to them, and some of it gets pretty steamy. 
  Anyone on the board? 
  No, but someone known to us. 
  I did not have any correspondence with him, thank you very much! 
  Someone else did. 
  Yes, I wrote to him, in a professional capacity. 
  Who made the contact? 
  I did, to correct him on procedure. 
  The pathology in his work was sloppy. 
  I felt he was being badly advised. 
  I said this. 
  How did he respond? 
  He begged me to advise him. 
  And so, it began - he sent me a murder, I sent him the pathology report. 
  I was exact and thorough. 
  I'd expect nothing less. 
  Soon, his book was published - not one word did he change. 
  My writing, with his name on it. 
  Did he offer payment? 
  I did not ask. 
  I was happy to be of use. 
  And then (SIGHS) 
  he became personal. 
  Romantic. 
  In what way? 
  Would I meet him? 
  Could he come to me? 
  Would I send money for a ticket? 
  But he was loaded. 
  He mentioned a cashflow problem. 
  He was not liquid. 
  I hope you didn't send anything. 
  Please. 
  I'm Russian. 
  I do not fall for this kind of scam. 
  I told him - you want to come, buy your own ticket. 
  How did he take that? 
  No reply. 
  And then, the new book - 'Knife In The Back', with a killer who is a frigid pathologist called Nina. 
  After that you still went to the reading? 
  I'm not a wilting flower. 
  I just wanted to see this man who will take my knowledge and mock me. 
  Mike, I want you to know that nothing happened between this Rudd and me. 
  I understand. 
  He was a betrayer. 
  He stole people's lives and put them in his books. 
  Thank you, Gina, you've been very helpful. 
  (CHILDREN CHATTER, PLAY) 
  It is a particular smell. 
  BO, hormones and socks. 
  Is this about the other night? 
  Yeah, we're following up with everyone who was there, particularly people who had a connection to Jack Rudd. 
  Well, I guess you know we went to uni together. 
  Yes, we spoke to your old tutor. 
  Did you get a word in edgeways? 
  (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY) 
  My boss said he was very loquacious. 
  That's a good word. 
  Carnaby said that you were his star pupil. 
  He liked my stuff. 
  So why didn't you stick to writing? 
  Straight to the tough questions. 
  It's not just about talent. 
  You gotta have killer instinct- be ruthless, promote yourself. 
  I didn't have a clue about that sort of stuff - classic introvert - the polar opposite of Jack. 
  That's why I liked him. 
  He would bring the party, all I had to do was tag along. 
  We were good friends. 
  Did you stay in touch after uni? 
  Initially. 
  We were on the same track - we'd both written novels, and looking for publishers. 
  And then I got the call- the one you dream of. 
  An agent from Sydney loved my work - loved the sample I sent- wanted to read the book, wanted me to come over. 
  Jack said I should jump on it. 
  So I did, and he tagged along for the ride. 
  And jumped on the agent. 
  It wasn't me she wanted any more. 
  He got published instead, got a deal in the States and got launched. 
  That must have been a kick in the teeth. 
  I lost my confidence. 
  Put the book in the bottom drawer and stopped hustling. 
  But like I said, you gotta want it. 
  Maybe I didn't want it enough. 
  You're not bitter'? 
  What's the point? 
  I made my choice. 
  And I love teaching - inspiring the next generation. 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  Oh. 
  Sorry. 
  I'll come back later. 
  See? 
  When you find one like her it makes it all worthwhile. 
  Is she your star pupil? 
  Yeah, she is. 
  She's very special. 
  (INTRIGUING MUSIC) 
  (DING!) 
  Detective. 
  More questions? 
  Until there are answers there are always more questions, Maxine. 
  Rig ht. 
  Well, that's very existential. 
  But right now, I'm here as a customer. 
  D'you have any Jack Rudds? 
  Oh, I've just got a new order in. 
  They've been flying off the shelves. 
  I'll take one of everything. 
  Well, I haven't even opened the box yet. 
  Right, well, while you're doing that, I'll take another look around upstairs. 
  The tape's still up. 
  No one's been up there. 
  There you go - didn't even have to ask the question. 
  (OMINOUS, TENSE MUSIC) 
  (TENSE MUSIC) 
  Everything all right, Detective? 
  Your books. 
  Huh. 
  Was there usually something hanging there? 
  (GASPS) 
  My silk wall hanging! 
  Japanese. 
  You didn't know it was gone? 
  God, the public. 
  If it's not tied down My second husband bought me that in Osaka on our honeymoon. 
  It's a beautiful word, isn't it - honeymoon. 
  Don't suppose I'll be doing that again. 
  You never know. 
  I've had more than a couple. 
  Yes, but you're a man. 
  (INTRIGUING MUSIC) 
  (MOUSE CLICKS, KEYBOARD CLACKS) 
  (INTRIGUING, BROODING MUSIC) 
  (SINISTER MUSIC) 
  Oh my God. 
  Cold Cuts set in some freezing works - a couple of young 'varsity students, working on the holidays, one gets butchered. 
  Not ideal off-duty reading for a homicide detective. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Agreed. 
  If I was in your shoes, IÃ¢Âd be going for romance. 
  Somehow it's never really worked out for me as a literary genre. 
  But all the greats are there! 
  We've got Emily, Charlotte, and my personal favourite, the mighty Jane. 
  I don't think Jane Austen's gonna help me figure out who bumped off Jack Rudd. 
  Is that what all of this is about? 
  Rudd was an egotist. 
  They always leave a trail. 
  Well, I'll leave you to it. 
  Have fun, eh? 
  Hey, you wanna know who did it? 
  I reckon I'll figure it out. 
  (INTRIGUING MUSIC) 
  Anyone read this? 
  'To Sir With Loathing'. 
  Bad title. 
  It's all there. 
  Two friends - both writers, one's a success, the other a failure - moves to a small town and gets a job as an English teacher then has an affair with a 16-year-old pupil. 
  I mean, that's got to be Hamish. 
  It is. 
  Rudd sends a coded message outing Hamish as a sexual predator, so Hamish bumps off Rudd to protect his dirty secret. 
  You've been Googling, haven't you? 
  Mm-mm. 
  It's all in the book. 
  And on the internet. 
  Hamish left his last job under a cloud. 
  He was having s*x with a teenager. 
  Oh, Jesus. 
  So, it all fits? 
  Like a glove. 
  I did wonder that night the way he was with Lindy And at the school yesterday, she came into his room, scuttled off pretty quickly when she saw I was with him. 
  Yeah, talk to her again. 
  And revisit the mother. 
  She must have noticed something. 
  I'll push Hamish, see how far I can get. 
  Are you involved with Lindy Morris? 
  You mean sexually? 
  Yes. 
  Absolutely not. 
  But you have previously had affairs with pupils? 
  Not affairs, plural. 
  One affair. 
  And she was an ex pupil. 
  I was very careful about that. 
  Nonetheless, you lost your job. 
  I resigned. 
  It was my decision. 
  Following complaints to the board. 
  All right. 
  I could see where the parents were coming from. 
  It did blur the lines. 
  I was 30; he was 18. 
  She had left school, the relationship was legal, but I didn't fight the objections. 
  I left. 
  Did the relationship continue? 
  For a few months, and then she ended it. 
  Met a younger guy. 
  A job came up here and I thought, 'Great. 
  Fresh start. 
  ' Did you declare all this to your employers? 
  (SCOFFS) 
  IÃ¢Âd be a mug to try and hide it, wouldn't I? 
  I explained the circumstances. 
  Did Jack Rudd know about this? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, I told him. 
  And he put it in a book. 
  'To Sir With Loathing'. 
  Terrible title. 
  How did you feel about that? 
  Unsurprised. 
  Jack steals from everyone. 
  That's who he is. 
  He did more than steal. 
  He was defaming you. 
  Yes. 
  He said I was a serial abuser and a borderline psycho predator. 
  Jack likes to juice things up. 
  I don't prey on teenage girls. 
  Do you take anyone else to book club? 
  Or just Lindy? 
  Lindy can write. 
  Teachers like me, who care, always hope they can find that person - that needle in the haystack, the one that makes this craft all worthwhile. 
  (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) 
  Lindy's that girl. 
  I would never, ever, mess with her. 
  Her mum would break my legs. 
  No way would Hamish do anything like that. 
  Well I hate to say it, but it is often the people that seem the most trustworthy - youth workers, teachers Yeah, OK. 
  But I've got a pretty good radar for that sort of thing. 
  Being a single mum, you have to. 
  So you don't have any concerns about Hamish? 
  Yeah, I said that. 
  Look, you're barking up the wrong tree. 
  You wouldn't happen to know about a couple of items that have gone missing from here, would you? 
  What's this about? 
  Well, I'm just wondering if you've moved anything around - personal items. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  Far out. 
  Whenever anything goes missing, everyone always blames the cleaner. 
  Well there's no sign of a break-in, but there were definitely things missing, so I'm just wondering how many people have the access code? 
  Well, you've got it. 
  Plus I gave it to Maxine. 
  She didn't want me hanging around, but she was pretty keen on popping in. 
  Topping up the champagne bucket. 
  Changing the sheets. 
  She comes across all classy, but man, she was gagging for it. 
  I enjoyed Rudd's books as an insight into his character. 
  Oh? 
  What did you find? 
  That he likes using people, playing with their lives. 
  Isn't that what writers do? 
  Did you know that Hamish Drake had ambitions to be a writer? 
  Not everyone achieves their dreams. 
  Those who can, do; those who can't, teach. 
  Isn't that what they say? 
  ls he a good teacher? 
  How would I know? 
  He's a good customer. 
  He never misses book club. 
  Does he usually come alone? 
  Not any more. 
  He always brings the girl with him. 
  She sits there, silent as a clam, only opens her mouth to eat the supper. 
  I've been wondering why she comes, but I suppose it's a good way of throwing her mother off the scent. 
  Oh? 
  Well, it sounds innocent, doesn't it? 
  It's a good cover. 
  Cover for what? 
  Whatever a teacher and his pupil feel like doing outside school hours, Detective. 
  Sorry to interrupt, Maxine. 
  I've come for my plate. 
  Your plate? 
  With all the brouhaha the other evening, I left without it. 
  It'll be in the kitchen. 
  I hope so. 
  I spotted the two of them in his car, down by the estuary. 
  He'd taken a bit of trouble not to be seen. 
  They weren't taking in the view, put it that way. 
  Was there any sexual contact? 
  Not that I could see. 
  It was more- I found it. 
  Good. 
  It was the body language. 
  There was something between them. 
  Was this the first time you noticed it? 
  Yes, but I wasn't looking for it before. 
  This stuff goes on all the time under people's noses, in broad daylight, and no one sees it. 
  Detective Shepherd. 
  Call me Mike, please. 
  Hamish has his reputation to maintain. 
  He boarded with me when he first came here, and a nicer chap you couldn't meet. 
  Did he tell you why he came to Brokenwood? 
  That business about the girl? 
  Pfft! 
  There was nothing in it. 
  With respect, you don't know that. 
  If you want my two cents' worth, Maxine's making mischief to draw attention away from herself. 
  Did she mentioned to you what took place outside that night? 
  The night of the murder? 
  She was having quite a, uh, contretemps with that man Rudd. 
  We were in the kitchen, heating the savouries, when she suddenly took off. 
  We didn't have many pairs of hands, but we soldiered on, Lindy and I. 
  A few minutes later, I was taking the kitchen tidy bag out to the bin JACK: Puh-lease! 
  and the pair of them were in the courtyard, going at it hammer and tongs. 
  I didn't pay for you to come here and tomcat around with every small-town tramp that caught your eye. 
  Oh, so you wanted exclusive rights? 
  I wanted you. 
  That doesn't make you unusual. 
  But IÃ¢Âm not looking to tie myself down, and even if I was, it wouldn't be with someone like you, Maxine. 
  He was most unpleasant to her. 
  Savage. 
  You didn't think about coming forward with this earlier? 
  No. 
  I'm not one to gossip. 
  But I don't like what she's implying about Hamish, and if she didn't tell you about what happened, well, you need to ask yourself why. 
  (KEYPAD BEEPS) 
  Kristin. 
  I need you to come down to the bookshop. 
  Yeah, we need to put the heat on Maxine. 
  The feeling's mutual. 
  I've been extremely cooperative. 
  But not entirely truthful. 
  I beg your pardon? 
  We've been told you had heated words just minutes before Jack Rudd was killed. 
  Told by whom? 
  An eyewitness who could quote at length, talking about how 'He wouldn't want to be with 'someone like you'. 
  It was very insulting. 
  From a man that you've been more than generous to. 
  He was giving out all the signals. 
  He was a skilled player. 
  I was hardly out of my league. 
  Were you hoping to marry him? 
  I wanted to share his life. 
  And he said he wanted that too. 
  You must have been disappointed. 
  So, after this exchange, what did you do? 
  I came back inside. 
  Where exactly? 
  The bookshop. 
  You were there. 
  (GLASS RATTLES) 
  PETRA: Oops! 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Taxi! 
  Well, I'd only just arrived, and barely two minutes later, Jack Rudd was found dead. 
  Which suggests that a slightly longer time elapsed between your argument and Rudd's death. 
  Does it? 
  Well, think about it. 
  You argue, he goes inside, you follow. 
  He goes upstairs, you go into the bookshop. 
  Almost immediately, Petra leaves the bookshop and finds the body. 
  How does that add up? 
  Or is it possible you didn't go back into the bookshop? 
  Is it possible you went somewhere else? 
  Think carefully about what you did where you were and who saw you. 
  I was very upset. 
  I went to the bathroom. 
  I needed to do my face. 
  Upstairs or downstairs? 
  Downstairs. 
  How long were you in there? 
  Maybe 10 minutes. 
  I needed to take everything off and start again - it's quite a business. 
  Can anyone verify this? 
  (SCOFFS) 
  There was no one with me! 
  Why would there be? 
  What about when you came out? 
  There was someone waiting. 
  I came out and they slipped in. 
  You didn't see who it was? 
  I didn't make eye contact. 
  I was only just holding it together. 
  And so that's when you came out into the bookshop? 
  That's right. 
  So at the time Jack Rudd was murdered on your premises, with your knife, you can't prove where you were? 
  I've just told you. 
  There's no witness. 
  You knew the layout of the building, you had a weapon, you had motive, and as far as we know, you were the last person to see Jack Rudd alive. 
  Petra found him. 
  She found him dead. 
  Petra had no reason to stab him in the back. 
  He didn't betray her. 
  Did you kill Jack Rudd? 
  I want you to leave. 
  I will not be answering any more questions without my lawyer. 
  We have motive, opportunity and a weapon. 
  But no physical evidence or witnesses. 
  And in a Jack Rudd murder, there's always a twist. 
  Yeah, it's not stacking up for me either. 
  Maxine is the woman spurned! 
  She spent big bucks on this guy. 
  Yeah, big bucks to you or me, but not to rich people like her. 
  50K, 100K, they don't miss it. 
  OK, pieces on the board. 
  Let's walk it through. 
  Here's our man. 
  And here's Maxine. 
  Let's assume she's telling the truth and she's in the downstairs toilet, fixing her lippy. 
  Meanwhile, Kristin, Gina and Jared arrive and see Reverend Greene, Mrs Marlowe, KL Carnaby, Maxine and Petra. 
  That leaves Hamish and Lindy. 
  According to Mrs Marlowe, Lindy was helping with supper. 
  But Mrs Marlowe left the kitchen. 
  OK, well, what did Lindy do then? 
  So, at this point, as far as we know, the last person to see Jack Rudd alive was Maxine or That's heavy. 
  What state was she in when you talked to her? 
  Numb. 
  Shocked. 
  As you would be. 
  Almost catatonic. 
  I mean, I just thought How old is she? 
  We won't bring Maxine in yet. 
  What about Lindy? 
  We'll talk to her in the morning. 
  (RELAXING GUITAR MUSIC)

  What are you doing, Petra? 
  I want to talk to you. 
  (SIGHS) 
  That's all kinds of wrong. 
  You're a suspect in an active murder investigation. 
  But you know I didn't do it. 
  Besides, can't a woman drop in on her ex? 
  I thought you didn't want the gossip. 
  For you, I'll risk the reputational damage. 
  Grab a glass, then.

  So, are you getting close? 
  I can't talk shop with you. 
  C'mon, just a hint. 
  I'm getting married next week! 
  I can't afford to have a murder rap hanging over me. 
  Next week? 
  Why the rush? 
  Why wait? 
  It's not as if there's a better offer. 
  Besides, how was I to know the book club was gonna turn into a blood bath? 
  Just saying, maybe you should postpone. 
  The cheese-maker would be suspicious. 
  He'd want to know why. 
  Tell him you need more time. 
  But I don't. 
  I'm tired of being alone. 
  I like arms around me. 
  And so I don't want any late-stage revelations about me and Jack Rudd. 
  At this point, you're not in danger of arrest. 
  Thank you. 
  But things change. 
  People hide things, so I'm not making any promises. 
  Yeah, about that, there is one tiny little thing that I didn't tell you. 
  Why do you do this, Petra? 
  It's nothing bad. 
  I just I took something from Jack's place. 
  Personal items? 
  No. 
  This. 
  Some wannabe writer gave it to Jack. 
  We started reading it.

  I tried downstairs, but someone was locked in. 
  I knocked, but they weren't budging. 
  WOMAN, TEARFULLY: Leave me alone. 
  Do you know who it was? 
  Hm.

  Sounded a bit like they'd been crying.

  - (CAR LOCK ALARM CHIRPS) 
  Best you lead this one out, OK'? 
  I've told you everything. 
  It's actually Lindy we're here to see. 
  We just have a few questions about book club, Lindy. 
  How long have you been going? 
  Just this year. 
 
 
 
  With Hamish. 
  You like it? 
  Are you a reader? 
  Anything she can get her hands on. 
  English is my best thing. 
  It's the only thing I like at school. 
  And Hamish is your teacher? 
  He's the best teacher I've ever had. 
  He knows a lot about writing. 
  And he says I've really got something. 
  He reckons the best way to improve your style is to read. 
  And he lends me a lot of stuff. 
  And at book club, I like meeting the writers. 
  Mm. 
  Were you excited to meet Jack Rudd? 
  Well, I like crime writing, and he's good. 
  I've got his audio books. 
  Have you heard those? 
  Yes. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  He reads very well. 
  He brings it alive. 
  I listen to them in bed. 
  It's like he's there in the room with you. 
  I didn't know that. 
  I have them on quiet. 
  So, did you talk to him at the reading? 
  We got there early so I could get a book signed. 
  So you had a conversation? 
  Not really. 
  (PETRA LAUGHS) 
  Thank you. 
  There you go, lovely. 
  Urn, can you sign my book? 
  Yeah, sure. 
  Name? 
  Lindy Morris. 
  Um, can you say There you go. 
  Next? 
  (TENSE MUSIC) 
  He wrote things for other people - I saw him - but he didn't ask me if I wanted anything, he just went He shoved it at me. 
  And then he went 'Next'. 
  And then what happened? 
  Well there was a queue, so I just took the book. 
  And then the reading started, and then there was supper. 
  Mrs Marlowe said that you helped with that? 
  She used to be my baby-sitter. 
  She never charged me. 
  Heart of gold. 
  So you were in the kitchen? 
  And then I took some food out. 
  Into the bookshop? 
  Passing it round. 
  Was Jack there? 
  He was being really nice to everyone. 
  I thought maybe he was nervous before, and I wanted to say something to him, so I went over. 
  No, thank you. 
  It's so amazing to meet you. 
  I gotta go. 
  Wait, I just wanna ask you something. 
  WHISPERS SHARPLY: Whatever you've been told, it's not true. 
  I just- I Get away from me. 
  What did you want to ask him? 
  WHISPERS: Tell them. 
  If he was my dad. 
  That's enough. 
  I'm sorry it's upsetting. 
  I've gotta get to work and Lindy's gotta get to school. 
  Oh, I can drop her there, if you like. 
  Did I do something wrong? 
  Oh, no, love. 
  (SIGHS) 
  What a jerk. 
  In front of everyone. 
  Are you sure about him being her father? 
  100%. 
  How old were you? 
  22. 
  Worked in the 'varsity cafe. 
  He used to come in all the time, put stuff on the tab. 
  He never paid. 
  So I'd put money in and cross him out of the book. 
  What a sucker. 
  But he was Well, you know what he was. 
  I knew I was gonna get my heart broken, but I didn't know I was gonna get up the duff. 
  Did you tell him? 
  Yeah. 
  And he went Default setting. 
  Don't wanna know. 
  I couldn't prove it. 
  So he went off to Sydney and that was that. 
  No contact, no child support. 
  It must've been hard. 
  I cleaned a lot of toilets. 
  But who cares? 
  Lindy's the best thing that's ever happened to me. 
  Shame her dad's such a prick. 
  I always wondered if it was true. 
  Cos I don't look like him. 
  Maybe it was just something she said, like a fairy tale or something. 
  (SIGHS) 
  He looked at me like I was something he wanted to wipe off his shoe. 
  I felt like nothing. 
  I just wanted to hide. 
  I went to the bathroom, but someone was in there, and I waited ages before she came out. 
  Who was it? 
  The bookshop lady. 
  She had way too much makeup on. 
  I locked myself in the toilet. 
  I didn't know what to do. 
  I thought everything Mum told me was a lie. 
  Did you see Jack Rudd when he was here? 
  Why bother? 
  He made it clear he didn't want to know me. 
  But you let Lindy go to the reading? 
  I didn't want to. 
  I knew it wouldn't end well. 
  We had a full on fight, but there was no stopping her. 
  There's no point, Lindy. 
  I just wanna ask him! 
  He won't admit it. 
  He never has. 
  But if he sees me, if I'm standing right there! 
  It won't make any difference! 
  You don't know that! 
  I did know. 
  I thought he's gonna slam her down and kick her in the guts. 
  That's who he is. 
  What did you do? 
  Drank a bottle of wine pretty fast. 
  It's kinda blurry after that. 
  So you were at home? 
  Yep. 
  By yourself? 
  Why? 
  It would just be helpful if someone could confirm it. 
  Believe me or don't believe me. 
  I don't care. 
  Thanks for the lift. 
  Lindy, while you were in the bathroom, did anyone knock on the door? 
  Um, I don't remember. 
  Why? 
  Take a minute. 
  I don't know. 
  Sorry. 
  (SIGHS) 
  The Mum's an interesting prospect. 
  Mm-hm. 
  And it clears one thing up. 
  She took the watch and the shaver. 
  She had access she has a motive in taking the shaver, at least - to get DNA. 
  That would eat away at you - someone denying your child was theirs. 
  So, what if she had the results to the DNA test? 
  lt's a positive. 
  But no one in the bookshop saw her. 
  I mean what are the odds? 
  The building is a rabbit warren, so it's risky, but she's got a hell of a motive. 
  OK, she's got the results, proof on Rudd, and thinking about the will. 
  Everything to next of kin. 
  Which now includes Lindy. 
  She wants to confront him. 
  OK, so Toni goes straight in the front door. 
  I'm inside. 
  No one sees her. 
  How else could she have got in'? 
  By coming round the back. 
  It's a much safer option. 
  Back door's not locked. 
  Yeah, because Maxine wouldn't have bothered about that with the state she was in. 
  Or Yeah, but why would you bother if the door's open? 
  Either way, it's possible. 
  Toni gets in, she finds Jack, she confronts him. 
  He denies it, but she's got the proof. 
  He doesn't care, he dares her to take him to court He's got deep pockets - she won't win - he walks away. 
  She sees the knife, it's a split-second thing It works. 
  Yeah, but only with the DNA results. 
  (TENSE MUSIC) 
  What now? 
  We have a warrant to search these premises. 
  Are you kidding? 
  'Fraid not. 
  I don't have time for this. 
  Won't be long. 
  They know what they're doing. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  (TENSE MUSIC) 
  Yeah, OK, I took them. 
  While you were cleaning? 
  No, I was still setting up. 
  I was there when he arrived. 
  Whoo! 
  Hang those up. 
  Wow. 
  He didn't even look at my face. 
  I was just a servant. 
  I felt like garbage. 
  I didn't even touch his clothes, I just walked out. 
  I couldn't drive - it wasn't safe - so I pulled off the road. 
  I wasn't thinking anything, there wasn't a plan. 
  And then I saw them. 
  I knew what was going down. 
  She was gonna get what she wanted, - and so was I. 
  - (CAR ENGINE STARTS) 
  When I got pregnant, you couldn't get these results unless you were a cop or something. 
  Now you can get them online - 24 hours, if you pay the express fee. 
  Was a match. 
  Of course I knew it would be, but to see it was I wanted him to know I didn't lie. 
  I wanted him to look at me. 
  You broke in here and stole my DNA? 
  I didn't break in, I have a key. 
  I could have you charged. 
  ls that all you care about? 
  It's entrapment. 
  Jack, you have a child! 
  It won't stand up in court. 
  Her name is Lindy. 
  Just get out! 
  Here she is - your daughter. 
  She's nothing. 
  You're nothing. 
  Now are you gonna go or am I gonna call the cops'? 
  (PHONE LOCK CLICKS) 
  (CHUCKLES SADLY) 
  He didn't wanna know his own flesh and blood. 
  When was this that you showed him the results? 
  The day he died. 
  That night, after you fought with Lindy, did you stay at home? 
  Or did you go looking for Jack? 
  Why would I wanna see that prick again? 
  She already lied. 
  More than once. 
  Yeah, she said she didn't take the razor; she did. 
  She said she never saw Rudd while he was here; she did. 
  So she could be lying about this too. 
  Yeah, but how is that possible? 
  I mean, how could she be coming and going without somebody Hold the bus. 
  When you were at the bookshop the night that Jack Rudd was murdered, did you see anyone on the street? 
  Why do you ask? 
  Just yes or no. 
  Yes. 
  I'd just stepped out and I saw this woman, and I noticed her cos she was- well, she was a very attractive wahine. 
  What was she doing? 
  Walking toward me. 
  And can you give us a description? 
  Do you want me to say that she's hot? 
  Well if she was, then, sure. 
  Nah, IÃ¢Âm not gonna say that. 
  That's just demeaning. 
  And, no, it was more meaningful than that. 
  Jared, we need Nah, seriously, she was walking towards me, like the girl from lpanema - she was tall and tanned and all of that, and I was thinking this could lead to somewhere other than lpanema, preferably somewhere local, you know? 
  And then? 
  Well, and then this van backed out and just about bowled her over. 
  Did you see who was driving? 
  Nah. 
  Didn't stop. 
  But it was a white van? 
  Aren't they all? 
  This is important. 
  Yeah, yeah, it was white with some kind of logo. 
  Green writing? 
  Yeah. 
  Something, something 'Fresh'? 
  Turns out she wasn't from lpanema, but my cousin from Hamilton. 
  It was a bit gutting, really. 
  (BRAKES SCREECH, WHINE) 
  (ENGINE TURNS OFF) 
  Toni, we need to answer a few more questions. 
  I'm working. 
  Move your vehicle. 
  You need to come down to the station now. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  Or what? 
  Or we'll arrest you. 
  I've had enough of you people. 
  You've lied to us three times. 
  We know that you were at the bookshop on the night of the murder. 
  Says who? 
  An eyewitness has you driving away from the scene in this van. 
  Mum? 
  You're not really gonna do this - put the cuffs on me in front of my kid? 
  We don't need to cuff you, you could just get in the car. 
  What's happening, Mum? 
  It's your choice, Toni. 
  You'd be wise to cooperate. 
  I'm just gonna go and answer a few questions, hon. 
  I'll be back in a minute. 
  I can stay here with her. 
  Whatever. 
  Don't talk to her. 
  No! 
  She didn't kill him! 
  Zip n. 
  Is there anything you've told us that you want to change? 
  Yeah, OK, I did go out that night. 
  I went to the shop. 
  What time? 
  I dunno. 
  After I drank the wine. 
  I was just so wild, thinkin' about my baby. 
  I was ready to shame, march in there and show him up. 
  But when I got there and I saw his face. 
  I knew she had this fantasy that he'd see her and he'd know, and it'd all be roses. 
  She'd have a dad at last, like everyone else. 
  I couldn't do it. 
  I knew he'd deny it, humiliate my girl, take away her dream. 
  Is there anyone I can call, someone you'd like to be with? 
  No. 
  Mrs Marlowe, maybe? 
  I just want Mum. 
  Is she going to jail? 
  Um Not at this point. 
  But she might? 
  Well, it's too early to say. 
  She didn't kill him. 
  I know she wanted to, but she didn't. 
  It's OK. 
  You don't have to say anything, Lindy. 
  It wasn't her. 
  (SIGHS) 
  It was me. 
  What's up? 
  We've got a situation. 
  Lindy's confessed. 
  To murder? 
  Yep. 
  I've got her next door. 
  That doesn't feel rig ht. 
  It could be. 
  No one remembers her going into the bathroom or coming out of it. 
  She's unaccounted for. 
  Toni, could you join us'? 
  In your own time, Lindy. 
  I did it. 
  I killed him. 
  He wouldn't talk to me and I was angry with him, so I went after him. 
  He went up the stairs, and a lady came out of the bathroom, and so I went in and I hid there til she was gone, and then I came out and I went up the stairs and I stabbed him with a knife. 
  SOBS: No. 
  No, no, no. 
  What did the knife look like, Lindy? 
  (SNIFFLES, SOBS) 
  Big. 
  Could you show us how big? 
  Lindy is indicating approximately 30-40cm. 
  Correct? 
  Yes. 
  Was there much blood? 
  Yes. 
  But not on me. 
  I want to stop this. 
  No, don't. 
  Love, you can't. 
  Leave me alone. 
  Just leave me alone. 
  I think we should take a break, Lindy. 
  We've got your confession. 
  - It's all in there. 
  It's safe. 
  - (RECORDER BEEPS) 
  Why don't you have a moment with your mum? 
  (POIGNANT MUSIC) 
  She's got the size of the knife wrong, the amount of blood is wrong, everything's wrong. 
  She's protecting her mum. 
  Take them home. 
  Are we arresting Toni? 
  No. 
  She came voluntarily, and we're not charging her. 
  Why not? 
  It's just a hunch. 
  Take them home. 
  But watch the house. 
  (INTRIGUING, TENSE MUSIC) 
  Thanks for coming in. 
  - Do you know this voice? 
  - (RECORDER BEEPS) 
  LINDY, ON RECORDING: Leave me alone. 
  Just leave me alone. 
  That's who I heard. 
  In the downstairs bathroom? 
  Yeah, right before I found Jack. 
  And there were little noises - indistinct- like crying, and then (KNOCKS ON DOOR) 
  Leave me alone. 
  You're positive? 
  It's the same person. 
  What's the boss playing at? 
  I don't know. 
  He's not sharing. 
  What do you think? 
  Oh, definitely the mum, but Lindy's covering. 
  Well, well, Mr Pervy. 
  Mm. 
  Mike, they've got a visitor. 
  MIKE: The English teacher? 
  Yeah. 
  Still with the limp? 
  Affirmative. 
  Do we go in'? 
  Nah, sit tight. 
  I've got one more thing I wanna try. 
  Uh, Mike, there's no 'l' in team. 
  What's going on? 
  - It's called back story. 
  - (PHONE BEEPS) 
  Mike stuff? 
  Mm-hm. 
  (QUIET, TENSE MUSIC) 
  (INTRIGUING, TENSE MUSIC) 
  (UNSETTLING, INTRIGUING MUSIC) 
  Nah. 
  Nah. 
  - (SIGHS) 
  - (PHONE CLICKS) 
  Hi. 
  I need a ladder. 
  Now I'm not curious, but Kristin would like to know what you're up to. 
  Testing a hypothesis. 
  I think it holds. 
  It's a bit nippy out. 
  Can I come in? 
  Is this about Lindy? 
  Yeah. 
  Toni called me. 
  I've just been round there. 
  She's beside herself. 
  Have you known Toni long? 
  How do you mean? 
  I mean, when did you first meet her? 
  How far back do you go? 
  To university. 
  She told us she worked in the cafe. 
  Yeah. 
  She had pink hair back then. 
  I never had the guts to talk to her, but Jack didn't have that problem. 
  You liked her? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  But she wasn't looking at me. 
  Then after a couple of months, she wasn't there any more. 
  Did you know what had happened? 
  The first I knew about it was when I moved here. 
  I was boarding at Mrs Marlowe's place, and Toni was living next door with Lindy. 
  And that's when Toni told you? 
  I couldn't believe it. 
  I mean, it was completely in character, but what an idiot - to tum your back on that, to deny it. 
  Was there any doubt in your mind? 
  No. 
  The timing made complete sense. 
  You should've seen her when she knew Jack was coming. 
  You should see him, Toni. 
  Confront him. 
  There's no point. 
  He won't admit it. 
  He's got a moral duty. 
  He doesn't know the meaning of that word. 
  But think. 
  I know how hard you work, but it is tough. 
  And Lindy is smart. 
  She should go to university, and he should I know, but he won't. 
  So make him. 
  Get the proof. 
  I didn't think she would, but she did it. 
  And he still denied it. 
  Said he would fight her every inch of the way. 
  It was disgusting. 
  What about Lindy? 
  Did she know about any of this? 
  A couple of days before the reading at the end of school I'm going to meet my dad! 
  Can you believe it? 
  I had to get her out of there. 
  It wasn't the place to talk. 
  You can't shut the door if you're in a classroom with a student any more, and with my history I didn't want any gossip. 
  I took her to the estuary. 
  Do you think he'll know me? 
  Like, instantly, just feel it'? 
  Don't get your hopes up, Lindy. 
  Why? 
  ls it not true? 
  No, no I'm sure it is, but- What? 
  You don't know how he'll react. 
  But he'll want me, won't he? 
  I had this awful feeling about it, but I didn't want to trash her dreams. 
  And then on the night, he was brutal. 
  Everything you've been told is not true. 
  He just rubbed her out and walked away. 
  It tore my heart out. 
  How could you do that? 
  She's not my kid. 
  Toni showed me the test results. 
  Deluded slag. 
  Why can't you do the right thing for once? 
  Acknowledge your own child and be a man. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  Like you know what that is. 
  The also-ran. 
  The nobody. 
  This is not about me. 
  No, nothing's about you, mate. 
  What are you? 
  You're an English teacher in a shitty little town. 
  You have no life. 
  No stow. 
  You're a loser. 
  I'm outta here. 
  (BLADE RINGS, FLESH SQUELCHES) 
  (UNSETTLING MUSIC) 
  (PANTS) 
  (TENSE MUSIC) 
  lt's quite high, that roof. 
  There was no other way. 
  I jumped. 
  (HEAVY THUD) 
  (GRUNTS) 
  It hurt like hell, but I could walk. 
  Just. 
  And there was no one around. 
  It was surreal. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  Everybody was chatting and eating. 
  And then (SCREAMING) 
  What did you think would happen? 
  I had no idea. 
  I mean, none of it was planned. 
  I was just waiting, I guess. 
  But I never thought Lindy would take the rap, and I couldn't let that happen. 
  It would wreck her life. 
  And Toni's. 
  I'll have to arrest you, Hamish. 
  I'll come quietly. 
  There it is - the title for my memoirs. 
  (KNOCKING) 
  Mike, I've got Toni out here. 
  We're finished. 
  Come in. 
  (TENDER MUSIC) 
  What have you done? 
  But (SIGHS) 
  What about your job? 
  What about it? 
  I'll never teach again, I know that. 
  (SIGHS) 
  It's not fair. 
  I know. 
  lt's OK. 
  I did the crime. 
  lt's on me. 
  I'll come and see you. 
  # You were right, love takes time That's all I want. 
  Jack was an idiot. 
  And he was wrong. 
  I've got a story, and now I've got the time to write it. 
  (CAP HISSES QUIETLY) 
  Well, hats off to you, Boss, you got the confession. 
  We got the confession. 
  Oh, come on, it was you. 
  It was backstory. 
  Plus character. 
  You know, in a strange way, he is a decent guy. 
  Yeah, I take back the Mr Pervy stuff. 
  (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) 
  Nice place for a wedding. 
  Hm. 
  IÃ¢Âm still surprised you got an invite. 
  We're adults. 
  No hard feelings. 
  Are you sure it's OK - bringing me? 
  Well the invite did said 'and partner'. 
  Yeah, but not work partner. 
  (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) 
  ls that the cheese-maker? 
  Looks like it. 
  Back in a tick. 
  OK. 
  This came into my possession. 
  I thought you might want it back. 
  (GASPS SOFTLY) 
  My manuscript? 
  Great plotting, distinctive tone. 
  You should get it published. 
  I'm very grateful. 
  Congratulations, mate. 
  Best of luck. 
  (PANTS) 
  (LIGHT-HEARTED, GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC) 
  I hope he knows what he's in for. 
  Maybe they'll make it. 
  Maybe it's third time a charm. 
  # Magic in your touch, take my hand Underneath it all, you're quite a romantic, aren't you? 
  It's the triumph of hope over experience. 
  You gotta love it.
