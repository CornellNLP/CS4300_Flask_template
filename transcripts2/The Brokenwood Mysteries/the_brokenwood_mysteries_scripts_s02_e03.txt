 What is it? What's the matter? 
 Someone must be missing you, mate. 
 We could round up the local cray fishermen. 
 See who sticks their hand up. 
 Yeah, or not, as the case may be. 
 Check out the local doctors, and accident and emergency. 
 If it is a diving accident, the owner should have presented for treatment somewhere. 
 If they're still alive. 
 Looks like the rope's been cut. 
 Yeah, must be a Keely pot. 
 Because? 
 No-one else around here has that many pots. 
 The Keely family have been cray catchers for generations. 
 Yeah, then the dad died five years back in a boating 'accident'. 
 Fuel leak. Boat blew up. He got toasted. 
 Des the Devil. 
 That's what everyone called him. 
 Old man Des. Des the Devil. 
 Scary guy. 
 Somewhere to start. 
 Plus, that number. 
 It's the devil's number. 
 A coincidence, I'm sure. 
 Is it? Ma Keely and the two sons, Tommy and Liam, and daughter Liza gradually hoovered up all the local quota. 
 What does that have to do with the devil? 
 Oh, they're very protective of their patch. 
 Same as the devil. 
 OK. 
 Very. 
 OK. Got it. 
 Just so you know. 
 Yes, thanks. 
 Plus, when I found that hand... it pointed at me like old Des pointed at me. 
 Yeah, if he died five years ago that won't be his hand. 
 It could be a sign, though. 
 I thought I should hand it over. 
 So, how was it severed? 
 Cut, sawn or chopped? What with? 
 What made the puncture in the palm? 
 How long has it been in the water? 
 All that would be good. 
 Sorry, I get it now. 
 You said, "Hand it over." 
 This is English humour. 
 Yeah, sorry. 
 I need to know whether the man or woman it was removed from was alive or dead at the time. 
 Man. 
 Hair on the back of the fingers. 
 The sides also. 
 But what about your theory around Russian women's hands being big and hairy? 
 I said they could be big. 
 I never said hairy. 
 Fair point. 
 Do I have hairy hands? 
 No. 
 You shouldn't make assumptions, Mike. 
 Well, it's part of the job. 
 Next you'll be assuming that I'm Russian. 
 You're not Russian? 
 Why do you ask this? 
 Perhaps it was Russian humour? 
 Oh, hey. 
 No record of anyone recording that kind of injury over the last three weeks. 
 If it was a diver, maybe he shot himself with his own spear gun. 
 Pinned himself, had to cut off his own hand, like that guy in the desert. 
 Missed that movie. 
 True story. 
 A bleeding diver, shark bait. 
 Might be lucky to find anything. 
 Well, either way, someone's missing a hand or someone's missing a father, son, husband, diving companion... 
 Yeah, but... If that's so, why no missing person report? 
 Well, I guess we should start with the owner of that cray pot. 
 You alright with that? 
 Yep. I'm good. 
 Senior? 
 Complaint - hit and run. 
 All yours. 
 Can I help you? 
 Does Ma have a name? 
 What the hell do you want? 
 Mrs Keely, might do? 
 Mrs Keely. 
 This is DSS Shepherd, I'm Detective Sims. 
 Here to ID one of your cray pots, actually. 
 Takes two Ds to show me a cray pot. 
 You're right, Mrs Keely, that's just part of it. 
 Well, it's a Keely pot. 
 What's it to you? 
 Well, we were hoping we could ask you some questions. 
 Returning cray pots is about all you're good for. 
 Where were you when my Des got done? 
 You're referring to your husband's boating accident? 
 Accident! Christ, is that what you lot still think? 
 I wasn't in Brokenwood at the time. 
 No, I don't remember you. 
 Or you. 
 It was that useless Gary McCloud. 
 Well, we understand that the coroner's report found it to be an accident. 
 Was he there? 
 Did he actually see it? 
 No, but the coroner's job is... 
 Where did you find the pot? 
 Brokenwood beach. 
 What was it doing there? 
 We were hoping that you could tell us. 
 If you've got questions, talk to Tommy and Liza. 
 In the meantime you can give me back my pot and bugger off. 
 Macmillan and I were just standing there...Macmillan? 
 Yes, that's my dog. 
 We were just standing there and suddenly it was upon us. 
 Whoosh! Never heard a thing. 
 One of those hybrid electrical things, do you think? 
 No engine noise at all? 
 I'm sorry? 
 What sort of car? 
 Ah! Japanese. 
 Or German. 
 It could have been Korean. 
 Foreign, anyway. 
 Right. Driver? 
 Oh, definitely. 
 Definitely what? 
 Cars don't drive themselves, do they? 
 Did you see the driver? 
 No. 
 Colour? 
 I told you, I didn't see him. 
 The car! What colour was the car? 
 You don't need to raise your voice. 
 Sandhills. 
 What? 
 Well, you asked where the car was, I'm telling you. Sandhills. 
 I mean, if it had been on Tahsee... 
 Wait, you were out at the beach? 
 Yes, that's what I've been telling you. Are you listening to me? 
 What time was this? 
 I told you. Earlier this morning. 
 And what colour was the car? 
 Now, it wasn't black. 
 Right. 
 Or white. 
 No, no, I can assure you of that. 
 So red, blue, green, pink... 
 That's where it gets a little difficult, you see. 
 ♪ Yes, I am 
 ♪ Oh, yes, I am ♪ 
 Tommy Keely? 
 Keely? Over there. 
 Popular. 
 Tommy? 
 Liam. 
 You want my brother. 
 Tommy? 
 My brother trying to put our rates up again? 
 Could we have a word outside? 
 That's Dominic Nichol. 
 Winemaker, right? 
 Not anymore. Went to the wall. 
 Works at the mussel farm now. 
 Left in a hurry when he saw you. 
 What's he done? 
 Nothing that we're aware of. 
 So you found our cray pot? 
 Yes. Number 66. 
 We need you to tell us where it was located. 
 Yeah. 
 I could take you out there tomorrow. 
 Crack of dawn at the jetty OK? 
 Detective Sims will be there. 
 Well, see you then, then. 
 If you're around, Sis. 
 And you will be? 
 Pursuing other enquiries. 
 You'll get more out of him. 
 Plus, boats and me don't really get along. 
 Take a pill.Oh, it's nothing to do with seasickness, it's the whole idea of it I don't like. 
 Had a wife who was into boats. 
 Which is why she's an ex-wife, ya-di-ya-di-ya, I get it. 
 She drowned. 
 Oh, my god. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It's OK.

 What are you doing here, Missy? 
 Tommy didn't tell you? 
 No, he doesn't tell me a lot. 
 We're going out to re-set that pot. 
 You know how to look after yourself on the water? 
 I'd like to think so. 
 That's a good thing. 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 You coming, too? 
 What are you doing? 
 You should take Liza with you. 
 That an order, is it? 
 No, course not. 
 I just thought that I... 
 Don't think! 
 Get your beauty sleep, girl. 
 You need it. 
 Reckon you can hold her steady or shall I drop the anchor? 
 No, I'm sweet, it's calm enough. 
 Sweet? 
 I'll be the judge of that. 
 So you found it down at Brokenwood beach? 
 Yeah. 
 Why didn't you call me to pick it up? Why the special treatment? 
 Someone handed it in. 
 Hm. That's a good one. 
 What is? 
 Handed it in. 
 Like lost property. 
 Well. Brokenwood beach would seem to be quite lost from here. 
 What about what was in it? 
 What was in it? 
 The crayfish. 
 The boys down the station hoovered them up first? 
 There were no crayfish. 
 Guess I'll have to take your word for it. 
 How often do you have to dive for a pot 'cause you've lost a buoy? 
 Every now and then. Why? 
 Do you like diving? 
 I'm a fisherman. 
 That's like asking a priest if he likes going to church. 
 The lab boy managed to lift a fingerprint. 
 They will send it across. 
 Good. 
 The hand was cut or sawn with a knife.How difficult would that be? 
 I mean, it's straight through the wrist bone, right? 
 It was severed above the carpus, where it's articulated to the ulna and the radius. 
 What I said. 
 So you'd need a big knife. 
 Like a diver's bowie knife? 
 Perhaps. 
 Whoever did it, would they have had to hold the victim down? 
 You mean, was he alive when the hand was sawn off? 
 Yes. 
 I don't think so. 
 But I need to see it's owner to be sure. 
 We live in hope. 
 What about the hole in the hand? 
 The hole in the hand. 
 Is that another use of English humour? 
 No. It's a question. 
 Oh. 
 The piercing indicates it penetrated through the palm. 
 He might have been defending himself from whoever killed him. 
 If he's dead. 
 Each numbered dot is a cray pot? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Can I get a copy of this? 
 This chart is the Keely family livelihood. 
 Two generations of good oil on the coastline. 
 OK. But we need to figure out how pot 66 got from here all the way down to Brokenwood beach. 
 Albatross, dolphin, octopus... 
 Not my problem. 
 No outsiders, that's been the rules. 
 My prick of a brother's the exception. 
 Does the location of pot 66 have any significance that you can see? 
 Not the location. 
 What, then? 
 Well, 66. 
 That's the devil's number, isn't it? 
 So I've heard. 
 OK. Well, time to get back. 
 Thanks for the insight. 
 Not at all. 
 (CAMERA CLICKS) 
 What are you doing? 
 Text from mum. Just checking I'll be home for roast this Sunday. 
 Fingerprints section managed to lift one and it'll be emailed through. 
 I'll chase them up for a match. 
 Hold on! This hit and run. 
 Which wasn't, actually. 
 He was there the same time as Jared? 
 The vehicle might be connected. 
 Yeah. 
 No engine noise, electric... 
 Or not. 
 Of a colour that is not black or white. 
 Achromatopsia. 
 A rare condition, but our witness has it. 
 He can only see in greyscale. 
 And... 
 Deaf as a post? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Has Kristin checked in? 
 No. 
 My family's had to fight like hell to preserve its quota. 
 Doesn't help when one of your own turns against you. 
 Your brother, Liam? 
 Lazy dickhead. Instead of working his share of the quota? 
 He leases it out to those bastards he was drinking with. 
 Dominic Nichol? 
 Nichol's boss. 
 Wes Pullman. 
 Pullman by name, Pullman by nature. 
 Do you like that? 
 He pulls Nichol's strings. 
 Owns all the mussel farms out over there. 
 Wants to own everything else, including our share of the cray quota. 
 But you won't sell? 
 Hell, no! Doesn't help when your own flesh and blood is giving the b*st*rd a sniff, though. 
 Apple of the old man's eye. 
 Rotten apple, more like it. 
 Great day to be out on the water. 
 Great to have some new blood in town. 
 Hey, boss! 
 Boss! Turn it off! Turn it off! 
 Bryce Fahey. 
 Local fisheries officer. 
 Are you sure? 
 Hard to tell with him all waterlogged like that, but... 
 Yeah. 
 As much a pain in the arse in death as he was in life. 
 Friend of yours, was he? 
 Don't look at me. 
 Your problem with this idiot isn't finding people who wanted to throttle him. 
 It's finding someone who didn't. 
 Talk to the boss. 
 His boss is Wes Pullman who owns the mussel farm. 
 And, according to Tommy Keely, wants to get his hands on the Keely cray quota. 
 Not that I'd trust Tommy's word. 
 Or his hands, for that matter. 
 Presumably we have a match for the hand, by the looks of where it was severed? 
 That's your professional opinion? 
 Do you reckon he lost that before or after death? 
 If you let me do my job, I might be able to get you that opinion. 
 Right you are. 
 Mike! 
 Yes? 
 The victim. He was very handsome. 
 Well, if you say so. 
 No. It was an English language joke. Hand. Some. 
 A man with only some of his hands. 
 Right. That's very... good. 
 Won't hold you up. 
 Got it. Ta. 
 Breen says Bryce Fahey was married and lives locally, but he can't raise his wife, Jools. 
 Where? 
 Lotts Road. 
 Why, if Jools Fahey is still alive, has she not missed her husband? 
 That's a good question. 
 Hey, um, yesterday, about your wife. 
 Don't worry about it, Sims, you weren't to know. 
 True, but I'm sorry if I... 
 It's just one of those things. 
 Do you know why Johnny Cash always wore black? 
 Do I want to know? 
 I think your inner country music fan, you are dying to know. 
 Mrs Fahey? 
 No-one home. 
 Where's the boat? 
 Maybe she was on it with him? 
 Which would explain why no missing person report was lodged. 
 Are we looking for another body? 
 Bryce goes out on the boat, perhaps with his wife. 
 There should be a vehicle with an empty boat trailer at one of the local boat ramps. 
 Find me one of Bryce Fahey's friends. We need to make formal ID. 
 Dunno about a friend. 
 Have you heard the bush telegraph on this guy? 
 What about his employer? 
 Fisheries department says there's a volunteer officer who worked alongside Bryce when needed. On it. 
 Welcome, friend. 
 Mr Cleland, DC Breen. I understand you're a colleague of Bryce Fahey. 
 Amen. 
 I take it that's Bryce Fahey? 
 It is, bless him. 
 Jewel in the line of duty. 
 One of our finest. 
 Thanks, Mr Cleland. 
 Preliminary results indicate he was dead before the hand was sawn off. 
 Also, the level of bloating suggests he's been in the water at least 48 hours. 
 Up to 72. The hand swelling. 
 The other hand that was found yesterday, Wednesday morning. 
 So the deed was done Mondayish? 
 Or even Sunday. 
 Thanks. 
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
 Noel Cleland didn't ask why Bryce Fahey's hand was missing? 
 Yeah. and Cliff Richard was born Harry Webb? 
 Who's Cliff Richard? 
 So Johnny Cash's real name can't be Johnny Cash, can it? 
 Oh, actually it is. Real, you see. 
 Authentic. Country. 
 Right. 
 So, Tammy Wynette's real name isn't Virginia Pugh? 
 I take it you've been notified. 
 Yeah, that bloody corpse. 
 We've had to delay the harvest. 
 So there's an export order of two tonnes of green-lipped mussels that won't be on the plane to the States tomorrow. 
 Oh, I'm sure Bryce Fahey would share your frustration, Mr Pullman, were he still alive. 
 He was a pain in the arse alive. 
 Even more so in death? 
 You said it, not me. 
 So you and Bryce weren't friends? 
 We had nothing in common. 
 Except the fishing industry. 
 Bryce was regarded as some as a bully. 
 And there wouldn't be a commercial or recreational fisherman in this district with a kind word for him. 
 So, if you think this was an accident, you're kidding. 
 So, you've got your suspicions, Mr Pullman? 
 Well, you could start with the seaside Appalachians. 
 You're referring to the Keelys? 
 You can hear the banjos a mile off. 
 Funnily enough, they were pointing the finger at you. 
 Those river rats can say what they like. 
 They've had it their own way for generations, think they own anything and everything with a bit of water round it. 
 Whereas, in reality, you own it? 
 Do you own a spear gun, Mr Pullman? 
 No. No, I don't. 
 But the boys on your boats do? 
 Well, in case of sharks, when they're surfacing the droppers, yes. 
 Have you ever used one? 
 Years ago. 
 I don't dive much these days. 
 See? You do have something in common with Bryce. 
 ♪ All around that... ♪ 
 It's possible we've uncovered a turf war. 
 Or, perhaps, a surf war? 
 Keely versus Pullman. 
 Livelihoods and businesses. 
 High stakes. 
 Yes.Jools Fahey, Bryce's wife, has just walked in. 
 With a surprise guest. 
 Dennis Buchanan. 
 On our way. 
 Jools Fahey is waiting for us. 
 Complete with lawyer. 
 That's front footing it. 
 How did it happen? 
 A diving accident, possibly. 
 Really? 
 Possibly. 
 What sort of accident? 
 He may have impaled himself on a spear gun. 
 Not possible. Bryce was a navy diver for 20 years. 
 With all due respect, even those with experience... 
 Bryce told me, if he had a diving mishap, not to believe it was an accident. 
 Those bastards! 
 Who? 
 All of them. This bloody town! 
 Who had a problem with Bryce? 
 Try anyone with a boat and a fishing rod. 
 Can you be any more specific? 
 When Bryce was decommissioned from the navy, I wanted to stay in the city. 
 But no, he wanted to be close to the bloody sea. 
 It's OK. Take your time. 
 How long since you've seen your husband, Mrs Fahey? 
 Four days, five. 
 You didn't notice his absence, feel the need to contact anyone? 
 I wasn't home, Detective. 
 Where were you? 
 You're not obliged to answer that. 
 True. But if you don't, we'll draw our own conclusions. 
 Which would be what? 
 We're not obliged to say. 
 Let's try again, shall we? 
 Did you phone home from wherever you were? 
 No, because I knew Bryce wasn't at home. 
 You knew he was out on the boat? 
 Yes. 
 Did you try and communicate with him, phone his mobile? 
 No. 
 Not once? In four or five days? 
 Let's just say she was out of network coverage. 
 Right. 
 Not easy these days. 
 Where exactly were you? 
 Probably easiest if I show you. 
 What size did you say that was? 
 40-footer, more or less. 
 More? 
 So, you're saying you're far enough out to be beyond cell phone coverage? 
 Yes. 
 Well, what about VHF radio? 
 This vessel doesn't have one. 
 You go out to sea without VHF? 
 Jools likes it old-school. 
 But you've got cell phones? 
 Who doesn't? 
 But you were out of range? 
 Yeah. Not unusual. 
 How do you operate one of these by yourself? 
 I've been sailing competitively since I was nine. 
 Why, still, it's a big boat. 
 What about docking? 
 She wasn't alone. 
 And you can vouch for this how? 
 I was with her. 
 This is mine. 
 (MOBILE RINGING) 
 Excuse me. 
 Breen? 
 I've located Bryce's trailer. 
 And we might have a lead on his boat. 
 A container ship has reported a boat matching Bryce's drifting, apparently unmanned, near the sea lane.

 Make yourself comfortable. 
 Not you. 
 Come on, Detective, you can't separate a client from their lawyer. 
 I can for witness statements. 
 Which is all this is at this stage. 
 Unless you know something I don't? 
 Back soon. 
 After you. 
 I should warn you, any information I have about my client, is privileged. 
 And I should remind you that any information you have, as a solicitor, in respect of your client, is the client's privilege, not yours. 
 Maybe you're confusing that rule with your right not to incriminate yourself? 
 Please, take a seat. 
 You need to instruct a lawyer that is not implicated in this to give you independent advice. 
 Dennis and I are involved. 
 More than as lawyer and client, I take it? 
 Yes. 
 You are having an affair with Dennis Buchanan? 
 An affair? 
 Oh, dear me! 
 How bourgeois, Detective! 
 That wouldn't be much of a scandal, even in Brokenwood. 
 And what would you call it? 
 More a menage a trois. 
 You're saying Bryce knew about you and Dennis? 
 That's not what it means. 
 He didn't just know, he was an active participant. 
 Right. 
 As I said, Bryce was ex-navy. 
 They're very broad-minded, sailors. 
 Mm. 
 So the three of you would go out on Dennis's gin palace together? 
 Regularly. 
 Occasionally. 
 No law against it, Dennis, we're consenting adults. 
 And I object to the term 
 'gin palace'. It's a cruiser. 
 But on this trip it was just the two of you? 
 Yes. 
 Why? Where was Bryce? 
 He said he had something to take care of that couldn't wait. 
 And what was that? 
 We tried not to discuss his work. 
 I wanted to be able to walk around town and not know who hated us. 
 If anything further comes to mind, please let me know. 
 And you, Detective. 
 A threesome! 
 Technically speaking, it's a menage a trois. 
 Oh, right. French. 
 So that makes it classy. 
 It's their business. 
 Yeah, but at their age? 
 Believe it or not, Breen, but some things get better with age. 
 Cheese. 
 Coffee for three? 
 I'm good. 
 Nah, not for me. 
 Well, it could be a long night. 
 That's one way to make it even longer. 
 You shouldn't have. Really. 
 OK. Overview. 
 Jared finds the cray pot with Bryce's hand here. 
 Which, according to Tommy Keely, came from exactly here. 
 Charmed it out of him, did you? 
 I may have accidentally slipped and taken a photograph. 
 Clumsy. 
 Pullman's mussel farm here, where the rest of Bryce's body was found. 
 And Bryce's boat found here, with the anchor rope cut. 
 So we have to work out from wind, tide and current over the last four or five days where it was last when Bryce was on it? 
 Or it might be easier than that. 
 The boat had all the latest navigational and communication gear, the IT guys must be able to put together a digital trail. 
 Could tide and current take the hand from here all the way to here, Brokenwood beach? 
 In time, maybe. 
 Jools says she last saw Bryce alive on Saturday before she and Buchanan set out on his cruiser. 
 And Gina reckons that Bryce was killed on Sunday or the Monday. 
 And that the hand was severed after he was dead. 
 So that gives the cray pot a maximum of three or four days to travel that distance. 
 How likely is that? 
 Mm. 
 Someone placed the hand on the beach. 
 So, whoever killed Bryce cut off his hand, then nicked a Keely cray pot, put it in the pot and placed it on the beach, knowing it would be found. 
 Maybe Jared was right. 
 Maybe cutting off the hand is some sort of sign. 
 Then, who was it for? 
 ♪ Rain pours down, down, down on your grave... ♪ 
 No, it was clean. 
 And nothing to indicate that his body was dragged back on board after the shot? 
 Boat's clean. 
 ♪ Songs we sang, the times we've cried, ♪ 
♪ The miles we walked will never die, ♪ 
♪ Pacts we made, intentions good ♪ 
♪ Adventures planned, the times we stood, ♪ 
♪ And the rain falls down on your grave... ♪ 
 Go with God, Bryce. 
 God forgives you. God loves you. 
 Cut that out. 
 Bryce wasn't religious. 
 That doesn't stop you from using a church when it's convenient! 
 Please, Mr Cleland. 
 Go in peace, Bryce. 
 Your passing will not be in vain. 
 Our cause needed a martyr. 
 It's her husband, for god's sake. 
 You take the Keelys. 
 I'll deal with Cleland. 
 I will not have this, do you understand? 
 DSS Shepherd. 
 A word, Mr Cleland? 
 Acting Fisheries Officer Cleland. 
 Apologies, Officer Cleland. 
 That's quite a job to take on as a volunteer. 
 Well, I'm not afraid of hard work. 
 God built the earth in six days. 
 Who am I to complain? 
 You're not worried that whoever killed Bryce may now target his successor? 
 Those who fight the good fight on earth shall find their rewards in heaven. 
 When you were talking about your cause needing a martyr, was what you were referring to? 
 Yes. 
 If you'll excuse me, I'd like to be there for the interment. 
 I didn't realise you were friends with Bryce? 
 We weren't, really. Just knew him. 
 We Keelys have lived and died at sea for generations. 
 Yeah. It was a boating tragedy that wrecked our family. 
 We're god-fearing people, Detective, despite what you might have heard. 
 And I make a point of honouring others who've lost their lives that way. 
 Mr Fahey wasn't a bad man. 
 Just mistaken. 
 Would your son, Tommy, share those sentiments? 
 Tommy finds it hard to forgive. 
 Liam, too. 
 Particularly each other. 
 Sorry. I didn't mean to upset her. 
 We can't move on. 
 She's stuck because she doesn't know. 
 Know what? 
 Who killed my father. 
 It was five years ago, wasn't it? 
 I could take a look into it and see if... 
 There won't be. 
 Thanks. 
 My condolences. 
 Tell me you're not here on business, Detective. 
 I spoke to Bryce's employer earlier. 
 They have consented for us to take a look at Bryce's files before they pick them up. 
 To what purpose? 
 I'm investigating a murder, Mr Buchanan. Purpose enough? 
 Jared? 
 Ssh! 
 You got a minute? 
 Take a seat. 
 OK. 
 Matthew 5:30. 
 "And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee. 
 "For it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish 
 "and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell." 
 Noel Cleland is a fundamentalist nutter. 
 Yeah. "Our cause needs martyrs." 
 Yeah, nutter is right. 
 You know Cleland? 
 Well, he came into my nan's church once. 
 He had some hocus pocus and the font caught fire. 
 Turned out it was methylated spirits. 
 Wow. Did your kids...? 
 So was Bryce Noel's right hand man, who needed to be cut off? 
 Maybe. But why? 
 Then there's, Revelations 13:18. "Hear his wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast. For it's the number of a man, the number of 600, three score and 6." 
 Sometimes, apparently, shortened to 66. 
 Tommy Keely did say that the significance of the cray pot might be that it's the devil's number. 
 That's what I said at the beach. 
 Well, yeah, but... 
 So you listened to him but not me? 
 Well, I just thought you might be a bit freaked out. 
 I was freaked out! 
 Hey, kids! 
 It does seem that Bryce was killed on the Sabbath. 
 No way! 
 And with stigmata. 
 With what? 
 There was a hole in his hand, right? 
 Like Jesus on the cross, when the nails went in. 
 Jesus! 
 Exactly. 
 So, round up the Christians. 
 Any lions handy? 
 What if whoever killed Bryce Fahey knew who killed Des Keely? 
 And the energy transferred into the hand and it pointed at me. 
 Like old devil Des, returning from the deep to remind me? 
 Reminding you of what? 
 He accused me of poaching once. 
 And were you? 
 No, but it was a heavy scene. 
 If I actually had crays in my kit there, I reckon I might've ended up like Bryce. 
 Are you suggesting Bryce was poaching and Des the devil returned from the dead to kill him? 
 No, because that would be implausible. 
 I'm just saying like I said before. 
 It felt like a sign. 
 OK. Yeah. Thanks, Jared. 
 It's been enlightening. 
 Any time. I'll see myself out. 
 Look. It does seem like there was some kind of bad blood between the Keely brothers. 
 And it does relate back to the cold case murder of their father. 
 Boating accident, not cold case. 
 Well, both Ma and Liza don't believe it was an accident. 
 How does this relate back to Bryce Fahey? 
 I don't know, but Ma more or less warned me that Tommy is a worry, and I agree. 
 He's either mad or bad. 
 I think Ma and Liza might be ready to say more. 
 Go for it. I'll check out Bryce's office and you're on Cleland. 
 Check out his movements Sunday, Monday. 
 Excellent. 
 The religious nut bar. 
 All the best jobs. 
 I read through those case notes, it's fairly cryptic. 
 I was hoping maybe you and your mum could giveme the full story. 
 Don't talk to mum. 
 She's gets real wound up about it. 
 OK. 
 Then um... what can you tell me about it? 
 There were poachers cleaning out our pots most nights. 
 Dad got real paranoid so, when he got a tip-off one night, someone was out there. 
 He went totally nuts. 
 ..well, you're Dad's girl. 
 Dad, don't! Just leave it. 
 I've had my absolute guts-full of these bastards. 
 I thought, if I went with him, I could get him to try to calm down. 
 Dad! 
 (EXPLOSION) 
 (SCREAMING) 
 Liza! 
 Dad had no chance. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That must have been horrific. 
 And your mum was there, too? 
 If it wasn't for her, I might have drowned. 
 (WAILING) 
 Help us, someone! Somebody! 
 Why do you think it wasn't an accident? 
 'Cause it wasn't. 
 Well, the maritime investigation deemed it was a fuel leak. 
 How did it come to have one? 
 A deliberate fuel leak? 
 Dad was a ticketed marine engineer. 
 And that boat was his pride and joy - he'd restored it from scratch. 
 Whoever it was who tipped him off about the cray poachers knew Dad was wound up about that. 
 Knew he'd would make for the boat and sabotaged it. 
 Makes it murder, doesn't it? 
 Where were your brothers that night? 
 Tommy and Liam were at the fishing club. 
 Together? 
 They sort of got along back then. 
 And they fell out over what happened to your father? 
 Why, Eliza? 
 Should ask them. 
 I'm asking you. 
 I can't say. 
 I can't. 
 I had no idea how much I'd miss Bryce. 
 Sounds like missing him was something you contemplated? 
 I didn't mean it like that. 
 
 
 
 Come through. 
 Bryce found the administrative side a bit of a challenge. 
 Hmm. 
 He liked putting things down on paper. 
 Making lists. 
 He didn't use that much. 
 He said his fingers were too big. 
 OK. 
 Shall I make you a coffee? 
 That'd be great. 
 Short black or flat white? 
 Long short black? 
 You do remind me of Bryce. 
 Is that how he had it? 
 No. 
 Big fingers. 
 You must need a break, Detective. 
 Another coffee? 
 Some other refreshment? 
 Any sign of breaking and entering while you were away? 
 No. 
 Has Dennis Buchanan been in the house since you got back? 
 Well, yes. 
 Was he in here? 
 I don't think so. 
 But I couldn't swear on the Bible. 
 Noel Cleland tried to get in here. 
 When was this? 
 He turned up late yesterday, in this ridiculous uniform. 
 I'm here in an official capacity. 
 I need to sequester Bryce's files. 
 Sequestering? 
 What did you say to him? 
 Bugger off, you officious prick! 
 I could do a red wine. 
 You did ask! 
 You're a hard man to track down, Mr Cleland. 
 Acting Fisheries Officer, Cleland. 
 Where's the Shepherd fellow? 
 On another line of enquiry. 
 Good name that, Shepherd. 
 The lord is our shepherd, you know. 
 Do you need a hand? 
 Have you lot cleared the fisheries boat yet? 
 I can't be expected to properly discharge my duties in that. 
 It's being sorted. 
 Where have you been? 
 Doing God's work. 
 Like what? 
 Apprehending miscreants and sinners of the sea. 
 Right. 
 Should we sit somewhere more comfy? 
 Sure! 
 ♪ 29 days until December comes ♪ 
♪ 29 nights till I'll be in your arms ♪ 
♪ And I know at least 27 out of the 29... ♪ 
 I'm with Liza. Dad was murdered. 
 Based on what? 
 Whoever made that call knew Dad was paranoid about poachers. 
 Knew he'd take the old boat out and wired it to blow. 
 You believe it was an inside job? 
 Can you get any more inside than family? 
 That's a serious allegation. 
 Murder's a serious business, wouldn't you say, Detective? 
 My brother Tommy made that call. 
 Do you have proof? 
 Jesus. It's on the police file, isn't it? 
 From the phone box outside in the car park. 
 There is... record on file of a call being made. 
 Yeah. 
 And being received by my dad on the landline of my family's house. 
 It was the call that sealed his fate. 
 But no-one in the club that night saw anyone use that phone. 
 Yeah, right! How likely is that? 
 Anyone coming into or going out of the car park, having a smoke, selling pot or even a drunken quickie up against the wall would have seen Tommy in there, making that call. 
 You're convinced it was Tommy? 
 Dad wouldn't have gone hooning out at poachers at that time of night unless he thought he had the real oil. 
 Tommy was the only one here apart from me whose word Dad would trust. 
 So Tommy intimidated the witnesses? 
 Tommy doesn't need to say or do anything. 
 Everyone knows he's an evil prick. 
 Yeah, well, he would have to be to murder his own father, wouldn't he? 
 You don't believe me? 
 Well, what was his motive? 
 Control. 
 But your father's will would have provided for shares, surely? 
 Meaningless. Tommy knew could bully Mum and Liza, effectively control their shares. 
 Tommy said you're leasing your cray quota to Pullman. 
 So what? Take the fee, let others do the work. 
 That's a legitimate business arrangement? 
 For which Pullman is paying better than market rates. 
 What's eating Tommy is that he's not controlling it. 
 Or me. 
 (CAR ALARM BEEPS) 
 Liam Keely is adamant that Tommy Keely killed their father. 
 Do you see a connection to Bryce Fahey? 
 Mm. If Tommy killed once he can kill again. 
 OK. Let's push Tommy's buttons, see if anything breaks. 
 But we need an excuse. 
 Sure hope god broke the mould when he made Cleland. He's nuts. 
 Nuts or obstructive? 
 Both. He can't really account for his whereabouts Sunday afternoon or evening. 
 Says he was in solitary prayer retreat. 
 Where? 
 Upstairs, in his bedroom. 
 Mm. Solitary prayer retreat. 
 Keep on him. 
 Empty. 
 Clearly it was full at some stage. 
 Dennis Buchanan had access, according to Jools. 
 And Noel Cleland turned up to sequester it. 
 What was he looking for? 
 Witnesses say your vehicle was at the boat ramp Sunday afternoon, when you say you were on a solitary prayer retreat in your bedroom. 
 Solitary prayer retreat is code for 'mind your own business'. 
 Right now, your business is our business. 
 I suppose I could resent being given a third degree by a fellow officer but I understand you're just doing your duty. 
 Just as I was doing mine on Sunday afternoon. 
 I decided to check out the Pullman mussel farm. 
 Why? 
 Because they were constantly in breach. 
 And Bryce was going soft on them. 
 What do you mean by that? 
 We had collected chapter and verse and multitudinous transgressions and yet, somehow, it all seemed to come to nothing. 
 (TELEPHONE RINGS) 
 If you'll excuse me. 
 Cleland's changed his story. 
 He now puts himself at the mussel farm on Sunday afternoon. 
 Gotta go. 
 Get to the mussel farm. See who else was out there on Sunday afternoon and whether they saw Cleland. 
 You want me to drive your car? 
 Yeah. It's a good car. 
 OK. Sure. 
 Automatic, right? 
 No. Manual. 
 Just kidding. 
 (ENGINE STARTS) 
 (ENGINE REVS) 
 The registered office for Pullman Aquaculture is here even though their actual office is across the corridor? 
 It's just a service address for the registrar of company. 
 We do that for a number of our clients. 
 Pullman Aquaculture is a client? 
 It's a small town, Detective. 
 It is, indeed. 
 When you were visiting Jools Fahey to offer your condolences, did you go into Bryce's home office? 
 I didn't see any need. 
 Even though he has a big fat file on your client, Pullman Aquaculture? 
 Did he? 
 Well, he did. 
 Seems to be empty now. 
 Did you see it? 
 No. 
 Were you aware of its existence? 
 (MOBILE RINGS) 
 This better be good. 
 Cleland says he and Bryce had Pullman nailed on any number of serious breaches, but nothing seemed to come of them. 
 So he went to Bryce's house, hoping to take over the file. 
 When I queried him on that, Cleland said something quite weird. 
 Bryce's death might have been a mercy. 
 For whom? 
 His greedy self. 
 His inference was that Bryce was on the take from Pullman. 
 Good work. 
 There's one another thing. 
 Cleland's a diver and owns a spear gun. 
 Get forensics to go over Cleland's inflatable and gear. 
 He'll regard that as an act of war. 
 Get a warrant, make it official. 
 He likes that. 
 I'm not keeping you, am I? 
 I want access to Bryce's bank accounts. 
 Absolutely. As soon as I sight a court order directing me to do so. 
 (GROWLING) 
 Did you know that Noel Cleland was out here on Sunday afternoon? 
 I did. Yes. 
 Were you out here, too? 
 No. I was at home. 
 Who else was out here? 
 No-one that I know of. 
 So what was he doing? 
 Snooping. Suspicious b*st*rd. 
 He rang with a list of non-compliances just as soon as he got to shore. On a Sunday! 
 Come back, Bryce Fahey. 
 All is forgiven. 
 Cleland's on a holy crusade. 
 That Bryce was hard-nosed but it was just business in the end. 
 Your boss says that Bryce was a bully. 
 To some, maybe. 
 To you? 
 A hassle. 
 But Cleland, he's a nightmare. 
 Did Cleland say that Bryce was out here with him on Sunday afternoon? 
 Dead or alive? 
 You tell me. 
 No, he didn't. 
 And, funnily enough, he didn't mention finding Bryce's body when he was checking the droppers. 
 Were you aware that they were both preparing a big case against Pullman? 
 We knew something was going on. 
 That would have threatened your livelihood out here. 
 Yeah. Maybe. 
 What with losing your vineyard and going bankrupt, that would have been hard to take. 
 If the fisheries department closes down the mussel farm, then I'm out on the street again. 
 So your job was worth a lot? 
 Worth taking the rap for Pullman, perhaps? 
 Come on! No way! 
 Where were you on Sunday evening? 
 I was at home with my wife. 
 Do you own a spear gun? 
 Yeah, course, but... 
 Can I take a look at it? 
 It's at home. It's not here. 
 OK. I won't hold you up any longer. 
 Thanks. 
 Let's go. 
 Hey, Mike, it's possible that both Cleland and Nichol were at or near the mussel farm around the time that Bryce Fahey was taken there. 
 Nichol reckons he's got himself an alibi but I'll check it out. 
 Got it. 
 Amy, tell Wes I'll wait in the car. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Liam! 
 G'day. 
 Wes Pullman, please. 
 Sorry, he's not available right now. 
 Excuse me. 
 Detective Shepherd... 
 Off somewhere with Liam Keely? 
 Business lunch. 
 Then you're going to be late, sorry. 
 My time is money, Shepherd. 
 Mine isn't. Just precious. 
 Take a seat. 
 Please. 
 I've just had an interesting conversation with your solicitor across the hallway. 
 How nice. 
 Not really. He was obstructive. 
 Which is why we're going to get a court order to access his client, Bryce Fahey's bank accounts. 
 Keeping yourself busy, I see. 
 And, while we're at it, we're going to get an order to access yours. 
 Would you like to speculate whether we'll find any payments from your company to Bryce Fahey? 
 You'd have to be blind to miss them! 
 We used Bryce Fahey as a consultant from time to time. 
 And we paid him a fee for his time and expertise. 
 You're confirming that a fisheries officer was moonlighting as a consultant for a company he was charged with overseeing? 
 I assumed Bryce was taking care of that side of it with his employer Not my concern. 
 Show me the contract. 
 Oral. 
 Invoices, detailing Bryce's work, payments made. 
 Might have been a bit dilatory there. 
 Have to get that sorted. 
 And the GST. 
 Tell Inland Revenue. 
 And the fraud squad. 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 I'll have you for vexatious oppression. 
 Haven't seen that particular charge in the Crimes Act. 
 Maybe it's under 'F' for fisheries. 
 Or 'B' for bollocks. 
 Does your car always get stuck in first gear? 
 You drove it back in first gear? 
 (SNIGGERING) 
 Got you again! 
 Some things can't be joked about, Sims. 
 What, boys and their cars? 
 I think they can. 
 What about the fact that Bryce Fahey was on the take from Pullman? 
 Mm. OK, that is not funny. 
 Chances are Bryce shredded the contents himself. 
 Wes Pullman was employing Fahey as a 'consultant'. 
 He's completely open about it. 
 Brazen. 
 Well, that's bribery and corruption in anyone's book. 
 Absolutely. 
 What are you doing? You just proved the guy's dodgy as heck. 
 Whatever else he is, Pullman's no mug and confessing to bribing Fahey, he's eliminating himself from the murder enquiry. 
 No motive. 
 He had Bryce Fahey right where he wanted him, in his back pocket, why would he want to kill him? 
 Do you think that Dominic Nichol had any idea that his boss did a deal with Bryce? 
 Unlikely. 
 Those kind of arrangements tend to work on a need to know basis. 
 Which means he genuinely thought his job was under threat from Bryce's investigations. 
 Which means he has motive. 
 Stopping a potential threat to his job. 
 Man under pressure. 
 And he has a spear gun. 
 Any more on Cleland? 
 Forensics have taken away a lot of bloody swabs from Cleland's inflatable, but say they could possibly be from fish. 
 He's a fruit cake. 
 And he strongly suspected Bryce had been gotten to by Pullman. 
 Saw it as a betrayal of the cause. 
 Was he capable of murdering Bryce to prevent a blight on God's work? 
 He does have that Old Testament fire and brimstone about him. 
 And the old b*st*rd threatened to prosecute me. 
 Really? What for? 
 Vexatious oppression. 
 Oh, phew! Is that all? 
 I thought it might have been for undersized muscles. 
 OK. 
 Whoa, that's workplace bullying. 
 I'll get you counselling. 
 (TELEPHONE RINGS) 
 Yeah, I would throw those back. 
 Don't! 
 Mike Shepherd. 
 Detective. Jools Fahey. 
 I know it's late, but there's something I need to tell you. 
 Certainly. I'm listening. 
 It would suit me better if you could come to mine. 
 OK. Sure. 
 Thank goodness you've come, Detective. 
 You'll have one, Detective? 
 Mike. 
 Perhaps you'd better tell me what I'm here for? 
 I like a man who's upfront. 
 So? 
 You won't stay with me unless I provide you with some information? 
 You need some company, someone to talk to, to... 
 I don't want you to think I'm trying to protect Dennis... 
 I didn't say anything... 
 I'm simply not the sort of woman who blindly commits to one man. 
 I've always found one's never enough. 
 I'll take your word for it. 
 And there's something I need from you, actually. 
 An assurance. 
 Yes? 
 That all those papers you removed from Bryce's office will be returned. 
 Of course. 
 And the book. Sentimental value. 
 Bryce picked it up at a flea market. 
 One of the last things we did together. 
 Understand? 
 I should go. 
 Sims. I need you back at the office. 
 You're practising for a magic trick? 
 Magic would be good right now. 
 Jools had me round at her place. 
 Had you? 
 To tell me something. 
 I think she was putting the bite on me. 
 You think? 
 She says she's not a one-man woman. 
 Oh! Poor old Dennis Buchanan! 
 Out with the lawyer and in with the cop. 
 It takes two to tango. 
 Or three, in her case. 
 I need you to take notes on everything that was said. 
 OK. 
 Can't wait! 
 There's something she's not telling us. 
 Something to do with this. 
 She asked for it back. 
 Drop it. 
 Where? 
 Just drop it. 
 No. 
 Why are we doing this again? 
 I found this in that book. 
 I closed it before I noted the page. 
 This is quite a big book. 
 Mm. Again? 
 Morning. 
 Hi, Mike. 
 Early start or late finish? 
 You casting aspersions on my morality? 
 Never! Just being neighbourly. 
 Hey, usual thanks. 
 Coming up. 
 No, I just finished Tai Chi class. 
 It's good for the biorhythms, you should come along. 
 Ah! Maybe when I'm not so busy. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Any luck with the freaky hand? 
 Not yet. About that, the morning you found the hand, did you see anyone else at the beach? 
 Any vehicles in the sandhills? 
 No, but if you didn't want to be seen, it'd be easy enough. 
 You said they were protective of their pots, the Keelys? 
 Very protective, you said. 
 Yeah, like I said, I crossed them once snorkelling for kinna and paua. 
 This was years ago, when their old man, devil Des, was still alive. 
 When I come up with a full kit, I find myself staring down the shaft of a spear gun. 
 Whoa! 
 Poaching our crays, eh? 
 You little b*st*rd. 
 No, just paua. 
 You show me. 
 I never forget a face or a name. 
 I'll never forget the way he was leaning on the stern and pointing his finger. 
 Freaky. 
 Had you taken his crays? 
 Nah. But Keely, holding the gun and threatening to use it, I believed him alright. 
 I could see it in his mad, bad Keely eyes that he'd pull the trigger. 
 Breen. Someone here for you. 
 Mr Alderston. 
 Ah! Mr Green. 
 I've remembered the colour of that car. 
 When I was walking Macmillan on Saturday afternoon down by the boat ramp, I saw these two men arguing. 
 Saturday is my roster day, Bryce. 
 How can I conduct my duties without the proper craft? 
 He called him Bryce? 
 Yes, he did. 
 And what did Bryce say? 
 Well, I couldn't quite hear because he was facing away from me, but I think it was something about it being personal. 
 Personal use! All the more reason why this iscompletely unacceptable!</fo Which car? 
 What? 
 You were describing two cars. 
 Which one is the same as the one that knocked you down? 
 Ah, well now, the one that was hooked up to the trailer was very light, so it wasn't that one, obviously. 
 Obviously! 
 No, obviously. 
 But there was another one parked nearby that was very similar. 
 I'll tell you this. 
 Those two men were very angry. 
 And the car that ran me down was driven in anger. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 And, in your mind, it was silver? 
 Oh, yes. 
 Or metallic blue. 
 I often get those two confused but in this case I am absolutely sure. 
 Of what? 
 That it was one of those colours. 
 Edward Alderston recalls seeing Noel Cleland and Bryce Fahey in an argument at the boat ramp, Saturday afternoon. 
 What about? 
 His hearing-impaired version of events suggests Bryce's trip was personal, not fisheries-related. 
 And that's about it. 
 OK. Interesting. 
 With that in mind... 
 The GPS data from Bryce's boat is back with a digital track of Bryce's boat's movements last weekend. 
 So, Bryce's boat anchored here on Saturday night. 
 Stayed there all night. 
 Then, just before dawn on Sunday, he received a call on his VHF radio and moved here. 
 He stayed there for an hour and then he returned to his original anchorage for the rest of the day. 
 Then, at 6:35pm in the evening on Sunday, he started drifting in this arc, which basically corresponds to wind and current, where it was spotted by a container ship on Thursday. 
 His radio was able to send a ship to shore distress signal, but it never did. 
 So, it all happened underwater. 
 And Bryce never made it back on-board his boat. 
 Bryce's boat was clean. So, whoever killed Bryce took his body back on board their craft then moved the body to Pullman's mussel farm. 
 Then moved the cray pot with the hand to Brokenwood beach. 
 What the hell was Bryce doing, way out there? 
 Yeah. What was the attraction? 
 Who did he rendezvous with on Sunday morning? 
 If it was personal, Dennis and Jools were out there. 
 That's a long way to go for a threesome. 
 What if he didn't know about the arrangement? 
 Ah. What's more personal than your wife having a menage a trois that you don't know about? 
 And look at these distances. 
 What this digital track shows us is that, whoever was involved in Bryce Fahey's demise had serious ocean-going horsepower. 
 Which leaves two with ocean-going craft capable of travelling those distances in that time frame. 
 Could Tommy Keely have been out there? 
 What's the French word for foursome? 
 I mean, is it worth talking to Buchanan again? 
 We need leverage. 
 Jools? 
 Ditto. We need something else. 
 Maybe the key is the boat. 
 Maybe the boat can tell us something that their owners can't. 
 I don't mind rattling Tommy's cage again, provided I have some back up muscles. 
 Go for it. 
 Hm. 
 That's more like it. 
 Ah! Bugger. 
 (WHISTLING) 
 Just don't give him any hint that his sister's been talking about their father's death. 
 You brought reinforcements, Mr Pencil-neck? 
 Detective Constable Breen. 
 This is Tommy Keely. 
 Takes two of you to tell me who stole my cray pot? 
 Same b*st*rd that knocked over Bryce Fahey, right? 
 We need to know your movements last Sunday, Tommy. 
 Why would I put a chopped hand in my own cray pot? 
 Where were you? 
 Here. 
 Ma and Liza will back me up. 
 I'm sure they will. 
 But we'll need to download the data from your GPS system to confirm where your vessel was. 
 So the word of my mother and my sister isn't good enough? 
 Under the circumstances, no. 
 Under what circumstances? 
 Ma and Liza are family. 
 Of course they'll back you. 
 'Cause they're family? 
 I wouldn't jump to conclusions, Detectives. 
 Isn't that what they say? 
 Why don't you ask who my enemies are, who's pointing the evil finger at me, eh? 
 Who is your enemy, Tommy? 
 You never told me your feelings about Bryce Fahey. 
 Wouldn't waste feelings on that loser, specially now he's carked it. 
 I told you. 
 Pullman's pulling the strings. 
 He's got everyone in his pocket. 
 Who's in his pocket, Tommy? 
 You heard the story of Cain and Abel? 
 Why don't you ask my brother who speaks no evil, how he can live off quarter of his share of our cray quota and we can scarcely make a living off the other three quarters, eh? 
 So who's Cain and who's Abel? 
 Why don't you bugger off? 
 Arrest me or get off my property. 
 That was enlightening. 
 Something happened there. 
 Oh, Christ. 
 Call for back up. 
 Eh? 
 Now! 
 Comms to PPC 2, we need back up to the Keely compound, Redall Rd. 
 Who are you calling? 
 I hope I'm wrong. 
 You bloody fool, you set him off... 
 Get off! You stupid bitch! 
 Liza! 
 He's here, he's got a knife! 
 Liza, where in the house are you? 
 Just stop him, you've got to or he'll kill her too. 
 When will you understand who runs this family? 
 What did you think would happen, eh? 
 (CRASHING) 
 You've been asking for this... 
 Tommy! 
 Please stop. 
 ..haven't you, you stupid bitch! 
 Tommy! 
 I wouldn't have picked you for a bloody nark, Sis. 
 Drop the knife! 
 How about you drop the gun? 
 Jesus, Tommy! 
 Shut up! 
 Drop the knife, Tommy! 
 Don't think I won't! 
 Tommy, put the knife down. 
 I don't think so, Pencil-neck I do. Drop the knife, Tommy. 
 On the ground! 
 Hands behind your head! 
 I'm so sorry, Mrs Keely. 
 You make sure my girl's OK. 
 You owe us that much. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Two sugars. 
 Tommy knew from something you said that Ma and me had been talking to you. 
 Liza, I am sorry but I can guarantee Tommy will be charged with assault and won't get police bail. 
 You guys always get it wrong. 
 Well, you could put him away for a lot longer if you want to. 
 What do... What do you mean? 
 What you said on the phone... 
 You've got to stop him, you've got to or he'll kill her, too. 
 Who did Tommy kill, Liza? 
 Hey, he will go away for a long time. 
 And we will make you and your mum safe. 
 Did Tommy kill Bryce Fahey? 
 No! 
 No, not him. 
 Liam told me that it was Tommy who called your father from the phone box in the club car park. 
 Do you believe that, too? 
 (TELEPHONE RINGS) 
 Hello. 
 Dad, Tommy said he's got word at the club there's poachers out. 
 (EXPLOSION AND SCREAMING) 
 It was Tommy. 
 I wanted to tell you. 
 For god's sake, shut up! 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 Isn't that thieves do? 
 A falling-out of thieves? 
 It's not what you think. 
 So, it wasn't that easy, that grubby? 
 You didn't murder your husband for his share of the gold that he had recovered? 
 No, we wouldn't do that! 
 Bryce had been looking for that for a long...Jools! 
 Jools! Just... 
 On 23rd December 1940, a German raider, the Orion, sank the 13,000 ton freighter, the Doncaster Star, somewhere off the north-eastern coast of New Zealand. 
 The ship tipped down with the crew, the ship's cat and 590 gold bars. 
 Including...this. 
 On Sunday morning you radioed your location here. 
 Bryce left the site of the wreck and brought this to you. 
 Right?He didn't want it on the fisheries boat. 
 There's all sorts coming and going down at that boat ramp. 
 We were about to alert the police that we'd found the wreck, so consider yourself notified. 
 You had every opportunity to report the wreck, and didn't. 
 Salvage law in this country's a vague and uncertain mess these days. 
 I don't care about the Doncaster Star. 
 I wanna know why you went to the site of the wreck and murdered Bryce Fahey. 
 Oh, my god! No, we didn't! Denis! 
 We couldn't do that even if we wanted to!Really? 
 Bryce wouldn't tell us the co-ordinates. 
 We still don't know where the wreck is.Yeah, he was paranoid about it.</ 
 He said, "If someone asks you about it, then we have to be careful..." 
 Did he say who it was? 
 No. 
 How worried? 
 Afraid of. 
 I suggest you find that man, you've found your murderer. 
 Why didn't you report or notice Bryce's absence? 
 Look, the arrangement was that we were to stay where we were and Bryce would ferry the gold to us each day. 
 You were expecting him Monday? 
 He didn't show. 
 He didn't answer his VHF. 
 And you thought what? 
 Silly Bryce had been having some jealousy issues, actually. 
 Right. 
 We thought he'd gone home in a huff. 
 So we came in on the Wednesday. 
 Come this way, Eliza. 
 (BUZZING) 
 Is that you, sis? Eh? 
 Hey. It's OK. 
 Liza! 
 Constable, can you show these two out? 
 Mike! 
 Liza Keely is making a full statement regarding her father's murder and Tommy Keely is in the cells. 
 Could you grab that maritime chart out of room 2? 
 Sure. 
 And, Sims. 
 Good work. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 So we've re-opened and closed the Keely case but we're still no closer to finding Bryce's murderer? 
 Dennis Buchanan and Jools Fahey say that someone else knew about the site of the wreck. 
 Someone who Bryce was afraid of. 
 Well, it can't have been Tommy, as evil as he is, he was with Liza that Sunday. 
 Unless she's lying, but why? 
 If we add degrees and minutes to these numbers, they turn out to be co-ordinates. 
 They're all eliminated, crossed out except the last one. 
 Which marks the position of the wreck of the Doncaster Star. 
 It's also exactly where Bryce was anchored on Sunday night, when he was murdered. 
 By someone that knew the position of the wreck and wanted the bullion for himself. 
 Someone who would have been very protective of their patch. 
 Or Ma Keely? 
 No? 
 (MOBILE RINGING) 
 Mike! 
 When Des busted you for poaching... 
 It was only pauas and mussels, Mike, God's honour. 
 You said he was leaning on the stern and pointing at you. 
 Yeah, I told you, the finger of death. 
 So he wasn't holding the spear gun? 
 No. 
 Who was holding it? 
 I told you. I looked in his eyes, and I knew he could use it. 
 Tommy? 
 Nah. 
 What? 
 C'mon. 
 (OUTBOARD MOTOR STARTS) 
 (OUTBOARD REVS) 
 (TYRES SCREECH) 
 How can you not love this? 
 No cassette player. 
 Oh! And the shockies are stuffed. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 So Bryce Fahey was murdered because he discovered the wreck and was taking the gold? 
 (MUFFLED SCREAM) 
 Liam Keely killed Bryce then tried to cover his tracks with a plan to implicate the biggest maritime businesses in town, both of whom he knew were pissed off with Bryce. 
 By planting the body at the mussel farm and the severed hand in the cray pot, he pointed the finger - so to speak - at both Wes Pullman and Tommy Keely. 
 His own brother! 
 Yeah. 
 Nice day for it. 
 What do you want? 
 Bit of a chat... about Bryce Fahey. 
 Yeah? You can bugger off. 
 Now, now. 
 Back off! 
 Put your hands above your heads. 
 You've only got one shot with that thing. 
 I'll take whoever moves first. 
 Come on. Who fancies your chances? 
 Not me. You? 
 No. 
 Nah. 
 No heroes here, Liam. 
 You going somewhere? 
 What do you think? 
 Forget something else? 
 Bastards. 
 Now, I hate boats, I really do. 
 But the bit about the fellowship of the high seas... 
 You b*st*rd.I'd just as soon bugger off back to dry land and leave you stuck out here in the sea lane with no propulsion and a storm brewing overnight but these old sea dogs say that's not kosher. 
 So, can we help you with anything? 
 A lift home? A tow? 
 A warm cuppa? 
 Chat about things. Murder. 
 That sort of thing. 
 That's the ticket, Liam. 
 Now, raise your hands above your head. 
 Good man. 
 You can drop them. 
 Just checking to see you've still got both of them.
