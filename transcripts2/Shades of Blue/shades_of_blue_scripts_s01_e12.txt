 Previously on "Shades of Blue"... 
 A video game? 
 I heard shots. 
 They sounded real. You heard them too, right? 
 I'll protect you. 
 I saved your ass today, which means tomorrow in that Internal Affairs interview you save mine. 
 Who, Joaquin Foster? 
 He left a fetish club right before we found Randy hanging. Can you take this one solo? I'll see what I can dig up. Joaquin here is Donnie's nephew. My name is Linklater. I'm a D.E.A. agent. Tomorrow we're gonna leverage the kidnapped man's wife,  into scheduling a pick-up, but with our drivers. I got a line on some real estate. That's why I agreed to d this job in the first place. You lied to me and you used me! What are you gonna do, Harlee? You broke the law, you put yourself in this position. If your only way out is to trust a junkie, you might just have hit rock bottom. That's a federal wire you're tampering with. Slight problem here, Woz. He's the murder suspect. Up! Get your hands up! I called it in. Stop! [gunshot] Ah! [sirens wailing] [exhales sharply] [tires screech] On the ground! Now! NYPD. I called it in. Detective Michael Loman from the 64th. [sirens wailing] All right. Where are we? NYPD beat Alpha Team to the scene. GPS in play is moving toward the hangar. I have to believe that's Harlee. Prep Charlie Team to take down the drop at the hangar as planned. Stahl, I need you to land at the armored truck. There's a casualty. Oh, God! Oh, God! Shh, you got to... You got to put pressure on it. It's the only way to stop the bleeding. Oh, forget about the bleeding. How do you stop the pain? How far to Mercy? No hospital. Wrong kind of attention. She needs a doctor, bro. I'll get her a doctor, just not one required to report a shooting. Ooh, Saperstein's guy? Isaiah? The doc's got a fully stocked clinic. The priest said he used to sew up gang-bangers. That clinic is in an apartment building. We drag her in there, it's the same as taking her to a hospital. I will ask him to make a house call. Yo, I ain't going to no fake doctor. Hey, who said anything about your punk ass? Huh? You're lucky we haven't put you down yet. What do I tell his wife? Nothing yet. There's a tactical operation still underway. We can't have her alerting anyone. You were acting on my orders, Agent Chen. Have Bravo Team seal off the area and just return to command. What's up? D.O.A. is one of the armored truck drivers. Head wound, close range. Any civilian witnesses? No. How did NYPD beat us here? Plainclothes detective called it in on a private line before it went wide. What precinct? I don't know. He's over there. Loman's gonna give us up. What? The money or the dead body? He's only been with us for weeks. Loyalty like that takes years. No. I protected him. He'll protect me. Reciprocity has its limits. He  still believes people are good. Not the people we're working with. Look, we don't know anything yet. Cristina is with Linda. I can have them in a car right now! And drive where? We're in a stolen car with stolen cash. We're committed! Now we stay the course. Deliver the money, then we get answers from Donnie and Linklater. Before the NYPD gets answers from Loman? Loman's not gonna break. [crashes] [tires screeching] [grunting] [inhales, exhales slowly] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [sirens wailing in distance] No, we got to get out of here. Come on. Harlee, whoa! Easy! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy, easy! Easy. I'm okay. You... You okay? You all right? I'm okay. Did we get hit? Yeah, by somebody who knew what they were doing. They took the money! [beeping] Come one, we got to get out of here. Come one, come on. Come on, Harlee! [beeping] Dr. Isaiah make it? He's in the back room. I thought this was a street shoot out. It was. They were gonna let me die, Father. Shut the... [groaning] You said gangs. That man is wearing a security uniform. I didn't say anything. We never talked. In fact, we were never here! This church is under my care. And that wounded suspect is under mine. You were hiding a bag of illegal pills last time we met. Shall we revisit that? The church is open this evening for confession. People will be here. Make it quick. Put him on the table. Get his vest off. No, no, no. She's first on the table. Your shoulder wound is superficial. Whatever happened below his vest isn't. He shot her! Fascinating. Who shot him? You can get her bullet out. That's not how we're doing it! It's absolutely how we're doing it. I don't play favorites, Detective. I roll up my sleeves and I do what needs doing. Now, you need to let me do that. And you need to wash your hands! [groaning and grunting] [yelling] Shut up. [groans] This is a really bad idea. NYPD. No need to be alarmed. We're undercover and we need your help. Can you do that? Okay. Give me your cell phone. And I need the receiver of that landline too. There a restroom back there? You need a key. I need you to lock the front door, okay? You don't know that we're here. You understand? The camera doesn't know we're here either. Pull the DVR they record to. And have it on the counter by the time we leave. I just heard a loud crash. [indistinct chatter] [car door closes] Nothing to see, Miss. FBI. [indistinct radio chatter] ♪ ♪ A blue four-door sedan. Correct. And all of it, all of the cash was in this blue four-door sedan? Nothing in the van? The two gunshot victims. And you did nothing to stop them? I called it in, I waited for backup. As soon as it was clear, I went to the body, I checked for vitals. He was my priority. Well, he was shot in the head. You just happened to be following this armored truck? I told you. I was investigating a murder. Which led to this armored truck hijacking-in-progress, which you called in, but did nothing to stop? Am I missing something here? Yeah, you are, Detective. Candor, details, a believable cover story. I can only tell you what I saw. But not who you saw, which is really the most important thing. They were wearing masks. They wearing masks. Who was wearing masks? The perpetrators. Agent Stahl. A minute. You're gonna want to take this. Don't move. Stahl. The second GPS tracker stopped moving at the scene of a hit-and-run. The van is not with it. What about a blue four-door sedan? Yeah, flipped on its hood. How did you know? Is Harlee in it? No one on site, but I have the device. What about the money? No, no money. If that cash does not land at that hangar, we lose Linklater, and we lose Donnie Pomp. Well, it's not here. Sweep it. Sweep the drop point. Sweep the hangar. Hey! Do I now have to remind you that this is a... federal investigation, right? And that lying to the FBI is a felony? Like I said, Agent Stahl, I have a report to file. That's gonna have to wait. Cuff him. Put him in the car. Are you arresting me? I'm continuing our conversation. You know, whoever hit us knew exactly where we'd be. Yeah, well, good bet it was Donnie. Why would he do that? We were delivering him a three million dollar share. It wasn't enough. He was short on a real estate deal. [cell phone ringing] [sighs] What do we do now? Point fingers. It's Wozniak! People who narc me out don't live to talk about it. People who bury the lead annoy me. What happened? The FBI is swarming the hangar. Where you knew I'd be to accept the money. Feds at the airstrip. I hate to disappoint, but there's a dead body back at the armored car  that proves I don't want to get caught. Whose dead body? I don't know. One of your Tweedles. Not sure who it was, Dee or Dum. Way to vet your people. We're gonna need a new drop point. We would, except I've got nothing to drop. We got hit at an intersection by somebody who knew exactly  what the cargo was. It's all gone. You expect me to believe that? We're both fine. Thanks. Not gonna be able to say the same for Donnie when I see him. Don... no way. Donnie would never do that. No? Put him on the phone. What? He's not there? Donnie was en route. You listen to me. I'm gonna text you both an address. A Chinese restaurant in Queens. 30 minutes. Be there. What's the play? Dim sum. 20 for the supplies, 80 for the DVR, and 40 for the car rental. I didn't rent you a car. Did you drive to work? We're renting your car. Thank you. [grunting, breathing heavily] [crying] We need a real pain-killer here. Anesthesia, something. I gave her the max of what I have. Just stop poking around at everything except the bullet! [moaning] Stop going in blind. You need to spread the wound open so you can see. Oh, God! Screw that bitch. Just eyes over here. Tell him to shut up or I'll give you another bullet to find. [Tess crying] You're hurting her. I know. Every time I spread the wound, it fills with blood. I can't see anything. You'll need to make an incision. No, no, no. Just spread it and pull the damn thing out already. The scalpel is in that black bag right there. I got it, I got it. Listen, I need you to lay still. Looks like a lot of blood. Don't look at that. Look at me. Oh, God! Firm pressure. One clean cut. ♪ ♪ Okay. One... Oh, just do it. Two... Just do it. Three. [yelling] I got a flipped car that says I'm not lying. What do you got? No bruises and a car with no dents. If I stole 12 million dollars, I'd be on my way to Barbados, not defending myself to you. That makes two of us. There's blood on your sleeve. I cut myself shaving. Yeah? Because whoever hit us used a pit maneuver. It was a cop. And? So is he. Which is how I heard about the murder of an armored truck driver and the disappearance of his partner, who happens to be my nephew. Did you know that they drew down on us first? They shot one of my crew. Unprovoked? Your nephew was ID'd as a suspect in a murder. This is a smoke screen. You assured me that the Feds weren't involved. This is what's going to happen. One of you is going to get me my money. The acoustics must be pretty bad in here for you, old man. How many times I got to tell you? We... don't... have it. And I don't have it. You know that. Well, you're gonna find it. In the next 24 hours. You know what I have on you? A desperate story. I, on the other hand... have this. The two of you and our kidnapped man. A test, huh? Not here, Woz. You back-stabbing, son of a bitch. That's enough. You want to play dirty? Yeah, I do. And I guarantee you, I'm better at it than you are. Yeah? You find me my money or you're gonna go down for all of this. You've got my number. ♪ ♪ How are we gonna find what we don't have? We're gonna pound the person who has it, Donnie. I'm gonna go check on Tess. You go buy us an alibi. I'm not looking to build a case against you, Detective. What I need is a witness. So this is standard bureau procedure... to secure the statement you'd like? Yeah, well, I find that cops don't always speak freely in front of other cops. If that's the case, then this trip was a waste because I did speak freely. Right, murder investigation. A real estate deal gone bad, involving an armored truck driver. Yes. I mean, we think that his partner was the money. We? Detective Tess Nazario and I are investigating the case. Look, call her, okay? She's at the 64th precinct. She's at the 64th? Right now? I wonder. Only one way to find out. Why wasn't Detective Nazario with you if you were following a suspect? She was working on something else. Look, I went to speak with Mr. Foster at his office. When his dispatcher started acting nervous, I went to find him in the field. Oh, so, just... wrong place at the perfect time. My specialty. How's that? Never mind. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret here, Detective. I knew that that armored truck robbery was going to happen. I knew that it was going to be an inside job because I've been tracking the crew that did it for awhile now. These... these people are... not your average criminals. They hide behind respectability. They abuse their power, prey on the vulnerable, and use an expectation and a culture of loyalty... as a shield. They think they're... untouchable. And they believe that they are righteous. Trust me, they are neither. They use people. Good people. People like you. They rope them in and then they rob them of their future. Now, I have them on tape planning this armored truck robbery, but given that things have just... gone to hell... I could really use a witness that could place them at the scene. So... once again... Detective... whom did you see at the armored truck robbery? Do you have any idea how screwed we are right now? Somebody is going to get crucified for this debacle. I have Wozniak and Donnie on a wire planning a heist. Without their hands on the money, it's circumstantial evidence. I think it's enough. You think busting a couple of local cops is a big enough win to shrug off 12 million missing dollars and two dead bodies? Let me put it to you plain, Stahl. The only way we crawl out of this is if you nail Linklater. Then you're in luck. D.E.A. field office just called. Linklater went back to work. You should be laying down. I should be on my knees. The shoulder's not far from the head. Tess, are you okay? Yeah, I'm just tired. I'm gonna go lay down. What about the armored car guy? He's in the backroom, post-op, messy surgery. Question is, what are we gonna do with him? Make him take a vow of silence. 
 
 [cell phone ringing] Did you do the drop? It's... well, there's kind of a funny story about that. I-I-I'll fill you in in a minute. Hey. How are you, baby? Man, do I need to hear your voice. Well, you're not gonna like what it's saying. It could be nothing, but the same car has passed by the house at least three or four times. What kind of car? You know me and cars. It's black, four doors. All right, Linda, I need you to listen to me carefully. Take Cristina, drive to the hotel on Rushleigh. All right, take side streets, and make sure that car isn't following you. You understand? Matt, you're scaring me. I need you to go...  now! Call me when you get there. Okay. Linda, I love you. I love you too. Yeah, that's him, Joaquin. Cops were asking questions about him. Okay. Hang on. What kind of questions? Somebody killed the guy next door, tossed him in a dumpster. Cops thought my boss did it. Then somebody else killed my boss. I guess they think it's that Joaquin guy. 'Cause he was buying the building. Yeah, him and his partner. Do me a favor. Just scroll through a few of those pics, and let me know if you see his partner. Okay. Yeah, this guy. Why? Are you surprised? No. It's Joaquin's uncle. Oh, God, I hope not. Why is that? Caught them blowing each other once. [cell phone ringing] Uh, thank you for your time. [phone beeps] Yeah? You got an ETA on Linklater? They're making the arrest as we speak. Good. Loman's story check out? Yeah, and the end is a surprise. Get ready for another one. I need Agent Stahl. I have his wire. Nothing. Two hours of silence after we tested it at your house. It doesn't make any sense. I wore it the whole time. It makes sense... if you tampered with it. It has an "On" switch and an "Off" switch! You just said that it recorded hours of silence! That means it was on! Look, I know how this looks. I know how everything that happened today looks, but I did what I was supposed to do. Then how come 12 million dollars vanished into thin air and I have nobody in custody? Look, we were en route to the airstrip... I can put together what happened. What I need to know is where the money went. From what I can tell,  the bullet missed the major organs, but what I can tell is limited. He'll need surgical follow-up. Can you just give me a minute? I've had a bad gut feeling before, but I'm guessing yours is worse. I should have popped you, instead of that bitch. Oops. You're gonna answer a few questions for me. Two landlords near 12th end up dead, one of them was a fetish club owner. My crew says that you killed him. Your crew can suck my... Did I forget to mention that if I don't like your answers, I'm gonna give you a second surgery? And I'm nothing but butter fingers. Donnie wanted you running protection in that neighborhood because he wanted to buy these two buildings. Two buildings? The fetish club owner wanted to sell, but the old dude next door... was holding out. Donnie left it to the club owner to persuade his neighbor or the deal was off. He wasn't supposed to kill that guy. Fine. He got carried away. That doesn't explain why you killed the fetish club owner. He started freaking out, demanding that Donnie cover up the murder. So we met up in the alley, saw the dead guy in the Dumpster. Donnie found this drunk-ass vet passed out nearby, se he took that guy's shoes off 'em and put them on him, and left him there to be found. He wakes up, wanders into the laundromat that pays me for protection. Donnie said you didn't think the drunk guy was guilty, so... he had to cover our asses because he said you were a good detective. I never done anything like that before. Shh, shh. You have a burden, but you're in the right place for it. What? What? Wh... wh... what? No, no. It's okay. Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Donnie Pomp. Wozniak is convinced he stole the money. Something about a real estate deal that he needed it for. If you give me time, I will find it. Did you know that Donnie Pomp slit your kidnapped guy's throat? What? You know, it's the first time I've ever actually believed you, Harlee. Funny how your mouth wasn't moving. What? Why would I go to the trouble of pulling the GPS from the van, and putting it with the money in the stolen car? Why would I even show up here? You know what, Harlee? I really don't even care anymore. He's downstairs. Agent Chen is bringing him up. Linklater. We've got him in custody. When we tell him that you are an asset and can corroborate his role in this heist, he's gonna give up everybody below him. And when we have Donnie Pomp, we'll find out where he hid the money. What about my crew? You promised me immunity for them. Um, no. That was some kind of miscommunication. I told you that was impossible. They'll be implicated with everybody else. But I'm free? We have serious concerns you undermined our operation in violation of your immunity deal. It's under review. Gail. I swear! Please! Gail! Wait! You need me. Give me one reason why. Because that's not Linklater. Hold him still. [crying] Make it stop! He's hemorrhaging. I thought you said he was good. I also said he needed a surgeon. Well, then rise to the occasion! Keep holding clean gauze here. He lost a ton of blood on the way over here and he's losing even more now. All right, maybe I can get my hands on some. You're not listening. Whatever is leaking, I can't patch up. If he doesn't go to the hospital, he dies. All right. I'll take him. I'll take him. Tufo, you're with me. What do I do with Tess? Get a room, pay cash. Get him up! Get him up! Get him up! You realize, even without the money or Linklater, I can make a solid case against Wozniak and Donnie? The wire you dropped in his office two days ago? They discussed the heist... their relationship. Put out the warrants on everybody. If you do that, you'll never find Linklater. Or whatever his name is. He posed as an active D.E.A. agent. I'm sure he's capable of disappearing. We'll flip Donnie Pomp. Great. If he even knows who Linklater's real identity is. I know Wozniak doesn't. Why don't you get to your suggestion? Look, if you round up everybody now, all you're gonna have is circumstantial evidence and no ringleader, no money. Look... Linklater's a ghost, but he gave us 24 hours to find the cash. Put me back in play. If I can find the money, I can put it in the same place as Donnie, Wozniak, and whoever the hell this Linklater is. You get everything you wanted. Except the rest of your crew. Linklater is the brass ring. You don't get him... with all this collateral damage... you know this whole operation goes down as a failure. [door opens] You can go. You sort things out? No, I just don't need you anymore. At least not for now. I see. Do you? Yeah. Everybody uses everybody else. No. You're wrong. Some people are users. Some people get used. And I bet you get a kick at being the former. Judging by the guilt on your face, it's a hell of a lot better than being the latter. I hit up a few of our loyal businesses. It's gonna cost us, but push come to shove, we have an alibi. The Feds were on to us, Harlee. Push already came to shove. We might get lucky. Word is Loman got picked up and released. No warrants suggest he kept his mouth shut. But we need to know what they know... and fast. I'll check in with Loman when it's safe. In the meantime, go over to the Rushleigh Hotel. Call Linda when you get there. Did something happen? No, it's just a car that was circling around the block. I told her to take Cristina and go. Could be nothing. Could be Linklater. Could be Miguel. All right, it could be Donnie for that matter. We're in a lot of crosshairs right now. Either way, I don't want this touching our girls. [moans] Is that Tess? No, no. Tess is with Espada. I got our friend Joaquin. I'm taking him to Mercy. Woz, what if he talks? Look. Tell Linda not to worry. Have you met Linda? Yeah, it was the best day of my life. Why aren't we moving? We are. Try not to talk too much. And that applies for when we get there too. How much are you gonna talk? About the man I killed? I think we can probably make an arrangement. My mother used to say that... bad decisions... are like dominoes. [coughing] Are you okay? She would make us... She would make us go to confession every Sunday. That's the good thing about being Catholic, you can set the dominoes back up. Except she'd knock them down every Monday. Including me and my brother. I hated her. I had a daughter. I'm sure she hated me too. Had? Yeah, had. I don't want to die. [somber music] ♪ ♪ All right. We're right here. What are we doing? Dropping him at the entrance? Yeah. Kid, come on, let go of my hand. Joaquin. Joa... Drive, Tufo. It... it's right here. Drive. Hi. How is she? She's a little scared and confused. I told her you'd explain what you could. You're good at this. I trust Matt. How is he? Good. In command. I'll get some ice. Hey, baby. Please? What happened to your face? Oh... Got rear-ended pretty good. That... It looks worse than it is. I don't even feel it. I need you to listen to me, baby. I didn't mean to scare you today. Maybe you shouldn't have pulled me out of school and sent me to Linda's house. I can explain that. Can you explain Linda racing me out to the car and sending me to a hotel? She saw somebody suspicious circling the block. Do you know how crazy that sounds? Yes. Which is why I appreciate you having faith in me, and believing that I'm doing what's right for you. Can't you just take me home? I can't do that. I need you to stay here. Maybe the next day or so. Mom, that's ridiculous! I have school and practice. I promise... the minute that we find out where Miguel is... [scoffs] And what he's doing... Miguel? Again? Look, I'm a smart kid, Mom. It's how I got into the good school, remember? Baby, I know that this is hard for you to understand. It's a lie. You told me Miguel didn't contact his parole officer. That's true. No, it's not. Look, I called your lawyer boyfriend's office. His assistant told me Miguel was exonerated. He doesn't even have a parole officer. There must be some sort of confusion. What, in your head? Because facts are facts, Mom. Did you even get rear-ended? Yes. You want me to believe you? Look me in the eyes right now... and tell me what's been going on. Where you've been? Why you've been acting so shady these past ten days? All I can tell you is that... it's important. And that I love you... more than my own life. And I need you to stay right here with Linda... until I come back. I guess I'll have to decide what part of that to believe. [sirens wailing in distance] [helicopter whirring] [indistinct radio chatter] This is not what it looks like. Really? Because it looks like you're robbing an armored truck filled with D.E.A. money. Loman, stand down. [car engine starts] [indistinct radio chatter] [helicopter whirring] [indistinct yelling] [gunshots] [grunts] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Put the gun down, Loman. [grunts] [yelling] Don't look at them. Look at me. Loman. Oh, God, no! Oh, that hurts. Hey, everybody, stop! You're all under arrest. Loman, listen to me. You have to let us go. What have you done? Harlee. Come on, we got to go. Everybody stop! Loman, look at me. Look at me. We're doing this for you. This isn't our heist. It's Donnie Pomp's. Remember the Internal Affairs officer? The one who questioned us? You're lying! He found out you killed Jamarr without cause. He found out that I lied for you. He told Wozniak that if we didn't do this, he'd put you and I in jail. And everybody volunteered. Okay? To protect you. You and me. Because that's what family does. What about the driver, huh? He killed Randy Royce. The guy from the s*x club. Were you in that too? No. I... we... we don't know anything about that. I swear. Donnie probably has something to do with that, but you have to give us time to figure it out. You called it in, so you're gonna have to be here when the first responders arrive. They're not gonna believe me. They will if you tell them the truth about everything. About the van, the shooting, the money, everything. Everything. What about you, huh? What do I tell them about you? You tell them that we were wearing masks. And that we almost made you on the way out. If you stick to that story, you protect us. Same way we're protecting you. If you don't... it's up to you. [cell phone dialing] [line trilling] NYPD, 64th precinct. Yes. The Captain's office, please. I know you think I'm a liar right now. I deserve that. But I really am who you think I am. I'm also someone that you'd swear I'm not. My daughter died... from a drug overdose... when she was ninet... My daughter killed herself... when she was 19. [crying] Right after we had a fight. I wanted to tell her... that she was wasting... her potential. And what I said... was that she was wasting... Space. I've been trying to fill the hole that those five words dug ever since. I always wanted to be a good cop. There's no straight line to that. I make deals with bad people... to keep drugs... from schools and parks. And I-I think to myself... that I'm... I'm doing that... 'cause maybe if somebody else did... what I did before... I did it... then maybe she would... she would still be alive. I told myself that it was for justice. That the end would justify the means, but now that I'm at the end, I can't justify anything. But what I didn't realize is... that compromises change you. They harden you. Make it easier for next time. I happened... so slowly... that I didn't realize. And so quickly that I... I never saw it coming. But all of it, Cristina... All of it... the good, the bad, the right, the wrong... It was for you. [line trilling] Hello? Hi, Dad. Can I call you that? I break rules... I take money... I hurt people to protect people. Uh, I'm a... I'm an NYPD bull in a Brooklyn china shop. But you're asking God's forgiveness. You're searching for absolution. Detective? I can't make a confession yet, Father. Because you can't accept God's mercy? No, because I got a couple more people that I need to hurt. ♪ Every move I make is just a part of my plan ♪
