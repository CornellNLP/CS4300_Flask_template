 Previously on Shades Of Blue... 
 I heard shots. They sounded real. 
 A videogame? 
 I gotta make this right. 
 Wozniak's been taking pay-offs. 
 Provided your cooperation leads to conviction, we'll grant you full immunity. 
 There's a rat on my team! 
 He threatened to kill me. 
 The man you're framing, Miguel Zepeda, the paper trail leads right back to you. 
 It's a big mistake. 
 We should polygraph the crew. 
 I'll just clear you tonight, Harlee. 
 Are you an informant for the FBI? 
 No. 
 Did you plant the knife in Miguel Zepeda's car? 
 No. 
 No. 
 [birds chirping] 
 [truck squealing and hissing] What happened to your arm? Nothing. I got burned on the stove. You're up early. Figured I'd get the lecture over with for going out last night. Mom, what is going on? Be careful. Just-- just go with it. I'm not five anymore, you know. Pretend that you are. [doorbell buzzes] FBI. Detective Santos? We need you to come with us. My daughter is here. Mom, who is it? Nothing, baby. It's just a work thing. Give me ten minutes. Mom, what's going on? I'm, um, consulting on a case. You know, on the side. Extra credit. But don't tell Woz. He already thinks I work too much. Couldn't sleep? I woke up, and you weren't there. Tell me I shouldn't worry. Does that ever work? I had that dream about Anna again. The day the two of you were coloring on yellow construction paper, she asked you if she could make the Sun green because yellow wouldn't show up. And you smiled and said you don't remember ever seeing a green Sun. But some-- But someday I'd like to. It's hard not to go back and think about what could have happened differently. She was 19 and clinically depressed. I shouldn't have argued with her that day. She knew you'd forgive her. Daughters make mistakes; fathers forgive. That's how it works. [printer whirring and telephones ringing] Hello, Harlee. Wish I were seeing you again under different circumstances. [sighs] You're behind this? I approved the operation, yeah. Did you approve them picking me up in front of my kid? I hate that this affects Cristina; I really do. But you have an opportunity to make her proud here, Harlee. You were good police once. I'm good police now. I need you to answer me truthfully, then. You want to tell me why I wasn't notified that my asset was just picked up? Stand down. Detective Santos, do you know about Wozniak accepting payment in casino chips? Nope. Agent Baker. May we step outside and talk alone, please? No. Detective Santos, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say will be used against you-- Oh, come on. I know my rights, Gail. I gave you 24 hours to find that leak, Stahl! We need more time! We don't think there is a leak. Here. When your tech pulled the NYPD personnel files, digital fingerprints were left on the precinct's computer. Think of it like library books. This shows that we've checked them out. If Wozniak's keeping tabs, he might easily assume that there's a mole, but he doesn't actually know anything. It's true. He polygraphed me. And if Wozniak knew I was betraying him-- What? Finish the sentence. He'd kill you? I don't know that. Too big a risk for a theory. Look, it's not just a theory. He's been talking about something big going down, more money. And I can tell he's nervous. Stahl is right. So we're getting this information when it suits you? No more games. I can't go to jail. Cristina needs me, Gail. One more day. I want something real. Come on. What? What happened to you? I called you a half hour ago. And I left potential morning s*x to get here. You know how long it's been since I had morning s*x? Makes leap year feel like next Tuesday. Lower your voice. It's early in the morning. You're a cheer captain? Hey. Hey, you want help with your trash? Ask your husband. I don't need help with trash. I need help with this. Behind my house. Tess, what the hell? Did you kill him? No, I moved him. He was over there. Please tell me you have a very good reason for doing that. Hey. Hey. Good morning, Harlee. Breakfast is on me. Thank you for putting up with last night. Getting off cheap. [chuckles] So what's the next move? I don't know. I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. What's this big new job you keep talking about? The Julliard money. Now, I know I-I can't keep borrowing from you, but if someone's talking to the feds... Yeah. I'll handle it before that. What-- what is this thing, Woz? Harlee, I said I'll handle it. We got another problem. A public defender got hit with ineffective assistance. Half the people he represented are looking for a retrial. One of those people-- Miguel Zepeda. Who told you? The new ADA, Nava. He asked me to pull relevant case files. I'm thinking that you should probably bring them to him-- you know, make sure we keep him invested. Miguel could get out? He's got to have legitimate cause. What we did, is it gonna hold up in court? As long as I'm there to testify, yeah, nobody'll know anything. And Cristina won't know he's her father. Woz, you got to promise me. Promise me that if I go down, you and Linda will take care of Cristina for me. Harlee, of course we will. Nothing's gonna happen to you. You're not gonna go to jail. I hope not. I knew she could beat the polygraph, 'cause I'm the one who taught her how. I was looking for her tell. And you found one? She tucks her hair behind her ear. You know, she did it when she was lying. Ten minutes ago, she did it when she was telling me the truth. I need something concrete. There's nothing concrete. You're convincing yourself that she's innocent because you care about her. Yeah, sure, I do. And all I have to go by is you telling me that there's a rat. Do you have anything more specific? Matt, we are about to move a lot of illegal cash. You need to get this buttoned up. I got to be sure. 6 years as a Marine, 25 years on the force. Your gut is the reason you're still alive. What does it say? That you can't take back a bullet. Requisition form? I'm asking for a new gun. Mine's jamming. Jamming, huh? Yeah. Mind if I take a look? Feed lips are bent. Yeah. Seems okay. Yeah, I guess I have to be more careful. I passed a car wash on my way in. Neighborhood's raising money to bury the man I killed. Keep your eyes on the road, Loman. If you're only looking in the rear view, it's an accident waiting to happen. I found that in my trunk. It's his. I thought you said he didn't have any ID. He didn't. I checked him. Yeah, well, you should check better. That's not some gangster, Tess. That's an NYU kid. Whisper any louder, it's not going to be a secret conversation. You guys okay? Yes. No. We moved a body. I hate you. Why would you do that? Look, I have my reasons. She's selling her house, hoping a fresh start will save her marriage. A dead body affects the bottom line. Only problem-- it's not some gangster no one's gonna investigate. It's an NYU student, Amir Abbas. We need to tell Wozniak. [phone ringing] No. Um, he's got a lot going on. I'll help you handle it, all right? Just give me a minute. What'd you get at breakfast? A muffin. That's funny. Is that what you're gonna tell Baker? Look, he's not talking. I tried, okay? You heard Baker. We need to give her something by the end of the day,  or she will arrest you. Hey, hey. You think I don't know that? I need this as badly as you do. Then what are you getting me? Look, he has a black book. It reads like case notes,  but it's all names and addresses, people he does business with. He keeps it in a locked file cabinet in his office. Great. Get it. What? Now? Wozniak could be back any minute. Then I suggest you hurry. [soft music] ♪ ♪ I'm not doing this. Doing what? Um, just busy work. Nava, right? You're here for the files? Yes and yes, Officer... Detective. Santos. Maybe we should go through them, make sure they're all here. Records room is notorious. You think that's a two-person job? I was just gonna supervise. A domestic violence call at this place? Who'd believe it? [screaming] [speaking Portuguese] I'm going to kill you! Dibs on the pimp. All right. That's enough. Let me go! This is business! When they hit back, it's time to hang up your pimp hat, old man. Easy, easy. Hey, hey. He's gone. You okay? He goes out of his way to put me with perverts. Yeah. I think you made it clear that you're not into that. Where are you from? Diamond Escorts. No, I mean that language. Portuguese, right? We have better insults. Yeah. How are your compliments? Your eyes are like the sky or something. [speaking Portuguese] That sounds nice. What does that mean? We were just, um, finishing up. With your pants on? [chuckles] You leaving? Looked at every file twice. Everything's here. I think your records room has a bad rap. I'd pay them the compliment, but I hate going down there. You afraid of the dark? Wouldn't you like to know? Come on; I'll walk you out. So one of those files there, um, I have some personal history with. Maybe we can, I don't know, go somewhere and discuss it. Um, shirt pocket, my card. Text me a time and place. I'll be there. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Did you get the book? No. Wozniak came back. Harlee-- Har-- Tess? Harlee, I'm such a moron. What kind of cop moves a dead body? What's going on? Joe already had cold feet about selling the place, but then when I saw that body in that vacant lot next to my house, I just-- I-I panicked. Look, I get that a corpse kills an open house, but why the rush to sell? Joe's been sleeping with some girl half my age. You know, selling the place was about the money. But now it's about us. You know, like a do-over or something. I hate him, Harlee, but I still love him. That's because you have a good heart. Never apologize for that, not even when things get complicated. You want complicated? The dead kid's dad is... on the board of that mosque on Arrington. The one that got fire-bombed. Yeah, this looks like a hate crime. Yeah. The FBI might be interested. I-I didn't even clean up the vacant lot. I-- If somebody decides to dig, I-- Yeah. Okay. Pull a car. Meet me out front. We both need that book, Harlee. Look, I have a lead on the murder of an influential Arab's son. Possible hate crime. I can get you the killer. I don't work Homicide, Harlee. Look, I'm out of options, okay? This is what I have. We need something. All right, but you'd better deliver. [knocking] Hey. Hey. How'd it go with the ADA? Good. I'll make sure he's invested. Where you off to? Tess's for lunch. Need anything? No. Oh, um, a couple of files were missing from Nava's box. I pulled your personal copies and xeroxed them, forgot to return the key with the files. What files? Girard and Dibble. But I'm meeting up with Nava later. I'll hand them over. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪

Uh, Harlee said you were missing these files. Girard and Dibble. No. Girard and Dibble. Got 'em right here. You come all the way down here just for that? No. I was here for a deposition. Thanks. 
 
 [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ That's Wozniak. Shouldn't we call Santos? She's looking into a murder, not betraying him. Let it ride. There's no blood. Did you see anybody running? No. It took me a minute to get to the window. Oh, here. Here. I found the casing. Didn't you say no exit wound? I didn't strip him naked. He only had blood coming out of one side of his T-shirt. That would mean the shooter was at a distance. The casing is right here where he fell. Nobody shot him. Look at the dent. He was using it as a target. He fired the gun. Casing dropped here. And the bullet ricocheted right back into him. Swell theory, except where's the gun? He could have thrown it on impact. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ He's leaving. You think we should follow? Mm. She passed his polygraph. He's probably just looking into Tess Nazario. You think he made us? What are we doing? The gun is too heavy to throw this far. Not if it's plastic. That's a toy. Then why does it have powder burns? Put the pimp in the cage. [speaking Portuguese] If somebody gave me time with a piece of ass, I wouldn't be reciting no poetry. It wasn't poetry. It was a compliment. That's nice. It really is. The thing is, you ain't got to sweet-talk a whore. It wasn't for her. Yeah? Who's it for? There's a woman I'm into. Brazilian. My man. Hitting it. The details, player. [stammering]. Not-- no. I'm not hitting it. I met her on a dating site. We've been e-mailing, but she doesn't speak much English. So when I realized the escort was Brazilian, I asked her to teach me how to say a few things. You asked a whore how to woo? Who says "Woo"? What are you, Amish? You know, you sit across from His Royal Highness King Panty-Dropper all damn day, and you ask a whore for lady advice. I knew this was a mistake. You know, I'm gonna go get a cookie, process this betrayal. Okay. Yeah. Get anything? The dead kid, he studied humanities. He took a computer survey class last semester. I doubt he's building 3-D guns in his spare time. Good. Case closed. No, no, no. Not necessarily. His roommate is an innovative technology major. It could be him. I got the address. Off-campus housing. We should run over and check it out. No. We let it go. Look, I don't want untraceable plastic guns out there any more than you do. If we make an arrest, we got to tell 'em where we got our lead. Either of you know how to do that? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ They followed me. The feds. And you thought coming here was a good idea? I lost them, Donnie. Well, if they had anything substantial, you'd be in custody. Harlee's the mole. She went through my filing cabinet. Then she lied about it. It's Harlee. She made her choice, Matt. Now you need to make yours. Protect your family, Lieutenant. Tonight. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Couldn't let it go either, huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not the bad guy. Good reflexes, though. Want me to clear the back? No, I got it. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Other room's clean. You find anything? Yeah, the reason why this kid was shooting guns next to Tess's house. That's her house in the background. Kid's her neighbor. I'll clean up. You go tell Tess. Yeah. That's gonna be fun. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Amir, you home? NYPD. Don't move. ♪ ♪ I don't have anything. You have the right to shut the hell up. Hey. If you came for dinner, you're gonna be disappointed. Tess, I, um-- I looked into the dead kid. Why? We agreed not to. He's your neighbor. His parents live in the house on the corner. Oh, man. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [phone ringing] Hey. Meet me at the marina in two hours. I got a hunch. ♪ ♪ Next Saturday, it's you and me. It's your job to think of something fun to do. Go to the gun range? I'm thinking maybe the space museum. Guns don't work in space. [phone ringing] You drag him to another hearing, I will sue you for full custody. In all your spare time? You want to hurt me? Do it yourself. See you, buddy. Stahl. Where's my evidence that Harlee is cooperating? I have three hours. Yeah, and I've been trying to reach you for the past two. I was in court. What case? It's a custody hearing. I'm on my way to see Harlee right now. You know, Robert, when you were transferred, I was warned that you may be under undue stress. Doesn't help when your boss gives you an arbitrary clock on a case I've been building for the last two months. Any agent who loses a partner in the line of duty is-- I'm on a tight deadline here. Can I help you with something? Yes. I thought you should know that Wozniak has arranged to meet Harlee outside the normal location pattern. Agent Stahl, I gave you a little rope when no one else would. Don't hang yourself with it. Ma'am, he's waiting for you. Thank you. Hi. Hey. Wow. I-- that's a dress. [chuckles] You look great. Thank you. I ordered something in French. Sounded like detergent. [laughs] That's what I get for being late. Yeah. I thought you wanted to talk about a case. I do. Feels a little like a date. The waiter said, "Good evening." Really? I-I-I couldn't hear that over the violin. There's a candle on the table. Damn, you're right. Maybe this  is  a date. What do we do now? Well, in the spirit of good first dates, things should probably get a little awkward. [chuckles] Six months to live? I'd be in Bali. Now, that would be a good first date. Or a honeymoon. What? A-are we getting married already? No. Actually, uh... it's where my honeymoon was supposed to be. Are you engaged? Used to be. It's recent. You still love her recent? She'd be upset if I was on a date recent. Ah, I get the feeling it's in flux. No. It's over. Just not finished. When it comes to awkward, I crush. No, I can do better. Hmm? Uh, you know that case I told you I had insight on? Mm-hmm. It was with a guy I dated, Miguel Zepeda. I'm not familiar. What'd he do? Um... I, um... you know, maybe you should just read the file. I thought you wanted to discuss it. Um, I'm sorry. I'll be right back. So who killed the Muslim kid? Are you trying to blow my cover? Turns out I got a schedule to keep. He killed himself. Accident. That doesn't help us. This does. That opens a locker at the student union. In it is a duffel bag filled with 3-D guns and the software used to print them. It's how the kid got dead. Who designed them? His roommate. Presently handcuffed to his bed. The address is in the duffel. So nothing from Wozniak, then? No. So you're not meeting him after this? I have your phone cloned, Harlee. Stop trying to play me. What's the marina? It's a pier overlooking La Guardia. Woz keeps his boat there. Hmm. Can't wait to see it. Look, it's private property. One parking lot. No traffic at night. He will spot you. Take your dress off. Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? I'm wiring you for the meet. You-- you're gonna strap me? Are you crazy? Just give me another necklace. If you think it's gonna be a problem for me to get close enough to hear a conversation, we're gonna need something that records too. So when I say, "Take your dress off"... [slams counter] You take your dress off. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [zipper unzipping] No. You don't touch me, ever. Listen, I will touch you whenever and however I deem necessary, because I own you. You understand? [airplane engine roaring] Do you understand me? Where's the fire? I had cut my date with the ADA short. You have a tell. What? You have a tell when you're lying, and you lied to me, Harlee. You lied to me! Really? A polygraph wasn't enough? I don't need to listen to this. You're gonna tell me the whole truth, or I swear to God I'll shoot you right here. Okay. What's my tell? What is this thing that I do that has you so sure that I'm a fed mole that you would kill me? You push your hair behind your ear. I pulled video footage of our first interview, the one where you were lying about Miguel. You did it then, and you did it last night. This is a joke, right? Is it? Because I did it five minutes ago and five minutes before that. I've been pushing my hair behind my ear since kindergarten. I also lick my lips, bite my nails... Don't! Tug at my-- Don't! Don't twist this around. Don't. There's nothing to twist. All right, what the-- what the hell is wrong with you? You know me. I also know the ADA wasn't missing any files, 'cause I dropped them off. You lied to me. You lied to me again. I lied about that. Okay. You know why? Because I was looking for Loman's psych eval. Lies. It's just more lies. No. You're a liar. Loman bashed his clip. And he was trying to turn his gun in. The shooting's messing with his head, Woz. I didn't want to come to you until I knew how bad it was. You don't believe me? Call him. Do it. Or maybe you want something more concrete. You gave me enough lead time for this meeting, made sure I came alone. If I'm the mole, I must have a wire. Here. Check my purse. There's a gun. Notice I didn't reach for it. No necklace. No earrings. Must be strapped somewhere. What are you doing? Body's the best place, right? Stop. Harlee, st-- No. Look at me. Look at me! It kills me that somebody's trying to hurt you. I'm so sorry this is happening. You know I'd do anything for you. Get dressed. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Hey, you sure you don't want another slice? Thank you. Hey, you earned it. 'Cause you worked hard. Mm-hmm. Here. You can have one. Didn't even know your cousin. You would have liked him. The funeral is tomorrow. You could come. Okay. That's enough. Let's go ahead and get you home. Okay. Wait for me by the door. Thank you. Yeah. Hey, uh... can I see you again? You donated a lot of money. Why? I'm familiar with tragedy.
