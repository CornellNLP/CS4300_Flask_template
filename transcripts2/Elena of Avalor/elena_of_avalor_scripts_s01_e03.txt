 I feel sorry for you, princesa. 
 Why? 
 Because I'm about to do this! 
 Now I feel sorry for you, Skylar. 
 Because I wanna do it again! 
 Ho ho, you asked for it! 
 I used to hike to these mountains when I was a kid, but I never had a view like this. 
 But I do not remember that monfuego being active. 
 Oh, yeah, that happened while you were gone. 
 This rock monster moved in, and don't ask me how, but whenever he gets angry, the monfuego starts to erupt. 
 Looks like he's having a bad day. 
 Let's not make it worse, okay? 
 Hey, how about we go through the waterfall this time? 
 Come on, let's go! 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 You better run, 'cause Charoca is comin'. 
 (all panting) 
 Oh, yeah? 
 That's right. No one beats me in a funny-face war. 
 No day, no way. 
 Now y'all stay off my mountain! 
 Uh-oh. Okay, gotta chill out. 
 Deep breaths. 
 In with the cool, out with the hot. 
 The cool mountain stream carries the red-hot anger away. 
 Stay calm, stay cool. 
 Stay calm... stay cool. 
 Stay calm. 
 Stay cool. 
 (chuckles) 
 The monster made a face at me. 
 He chased my little Damon. 
 He's going to make the monfuego erupt. 
 Erupt? 
 (chair squeaking) 
 Oh. Sorry. 
 My sister built this new kind of chair, but it's a little squeaky. 
 Go on. 
 Our village is at the foot of the mountain. 
 If the monfuego erupts, the lava could destroy everything. 
 Please do something, Princess Elena. 
 It is not just up to the princess. 
 A matter this important must be decided upon by a majority of the entire Grand Council. 
 ¿Que? 
 He means we have to vote on what to do. 
 Oh! 
 And I say we throw the monster out of Avalor. 
 Throw him out? 
 I must agree with Esteban. 
 This is a matter of public safety. 
 Does this... 
 (chair squeaks) 
 Sorry. Does this monster have a name? 
 He calls himself Charoca! 
 Well, since the monfuego only rumbles when Charoca is angry, has anybody asked him why he's so upset? 
 (laughs) Asked him? 
 There is no talking to a monster like that. 
 We must take action! 
 Ooh! That is really tough on the ears, isn't it? 
 Okay. 
 What are you doing? 
 Throwing out the chair. 
 But it only has a little squeak. 
 Why not try and fix it? 
 Exactly! Mm-hmm. 
 I would never throw something out without trying to fix it first. 
 So why should we throw out Charoca before trying to fix that problem, hm? 
 Ah! 
 Let me go talk to him and find out what's making him so angry. 
 Then, maybe I can get him to calm down, okay? 
 Let's vote on it! 
 All those in favor of me talking to Charoca. 
 I see no harm in trying. 
 Unless he roasts her. 
 But if you wanna give it a try, go for it. 
 Only if you're escorted by the Royal Guard. 
 Mmm, it's a deal. 
 Wish me luck! 
 (chair squeaking) 
 Princess Elena, your escort is assembled and ready. 
 Uh, it's a friendly visit, Gabe, not an invasion. 
 But your grandfather said it was too dangerous to go there alone. 
 All right then, saddle up. 
 (horse nickers) 
 You heard the princess. Let's go. 
 Oh, not them. Just you. Then I won't be alone. 
 Did you hear that, guys? 
 She just needs me. 
 You sure about that? 
 Go, Canela. 
 Follow that princess. 
 All right, if the monster attacks, I gotcha covered. 
 (gasps) Gabe, look. 
 Does this look like a place where a monster lives? 
 Whoa! 
 Princess! 
 He booby-trapped the perimeter. Fall back, fall back! 
 Gabe, it's just a hole. 
 It could be a booby trap disguised as a hole. 
 You can put that away. All right? I brought my own secret weapon. 
 Nobody can resist Avaloran chocolate. 
 Stay here. 
 Hello? Anybody home? 
 Señor Charoca? 
 Oh, guess I'll just wait. 
 Get off me! 
 So you think it's all right to just come in my house and sit on me? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I thought you were a chair. 
 So I look like a chair to you? 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Let's start over. I'm Princess... 
 I don't care who you are. I told you kids to stay away. 
 Okay, okay, there's no need to get all heated up. 
 Is that supposed to be some kind of joke? 
 What? No. 
 I was just... truffle? 
 Get out! 
 Wait! Gabe. 
 I had it all under control. 
 Obviously. 
 Lieutenant Nuñez, I wish to thank you for rescuing my granddaughter. 
 I didn't need rescuing. 
 Your appearance suggests otherwise. 
 First, this monster attacked the children, and now, he's attacked the Crown Princess. 
 I wouldn't say attacked. 
 I would. 
 We should throw him out of the kingdom before someone else gets hurt. 
 I don't think he'd hurt anyone. 
 How do you know? 
 I just have a feeling. 
 Elena, feelings are important but rulers must deal with facts. 
 And we know for a fact that the monster is a danger to everyone in the kingdom. 
 I say we vote to remove him from Avalor immediately. 
 All in favor. 
 (sighs) Abuela? 
 I understand how you feel, Elena, but nobody attacks my familia and gets away with it. 
 Charoca has to go. 
 Naomi? 
 Sorry, Elena. 
 Fine. 
 Lieutenant Nuñez, assemble the Royal Guard. 
 At once, chancellor. 
 Look, Elena. 
 This rock got so hot, it turned into glass. 
 That's great, Isabel. 
 You didn't even look at it. 
 (sighs) I'm sorry. 
 It's just not a good... 
 Wait. Where did you get that? 
 From one of my friends. They're getting them from the monfuego. 
 They call them monster rocks. 
 That's why he's so mad. 
 I have to go. 
 Hey, my rock. 
 It's not your rock. It's his! 
 Skylar, I need you to take me back to the monfuego. 
 Oh, not the one with the angry rock monster. 
 That's the one. 
 Nice knowin' you, Skylar. 
 Can I have your nest when you're gone? 
 Ooh, sorry, princesa. 
 Wish I could help, but I have a cramp in my left wing. 
 That's your right wing. 
 It's spreading. 
 Come on, Skylar, please. 
 Oh. Oh, not the sad puppy dog eyes. 
 You know I cannot resist them. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 Thanks. 
 Elena. 
 I'm sorry I voted against you. 
 It's okay, Naomi. I get it. 
 You had to do what you thought was right. 
 And now, I have to do what I think is right. 
 What do you mean? 
 I have a pretty good idea why Charoca's so angry. 
 I just need to make sure. 
 You're not going... 
 Sure am. 
 Well, then I'm coming with you. 
 You are? Why? 
 Because you're my best friend, even if we don't always agree. 
 And as your friend, there is no way I am letting you go alone. 
 Luna. 
 Say what? 
 Uh-uh. Last thing I'm gonna do is go anywhere near that monfuego. 
 Isn't this great, Luna? 
 You and me, partners on a risky, dangerous death-defying mission. 
 Right now, I wish you were a silent partner. 
 Two jaquins going in, only one may come out. 
 You keep talking and only one will come out. 
 I've got more monster rocks than you do. 
 Look out. Princess. 
 Who are you calling a princess? 
 Hi there. 
 Whoa. 
 What's your name? 
 Bella. 
 Those are pretty rocks, Bella. 
 We got 'em from the monster. 
 I see. 
 Did he say you could take them? 
 He didn't say we couldn't. 
 And he's a monster. 
 Well, just because he's different doesn't make him a monster. 
 And it doesn't mean it's okay to take his things. 
 Sorry. 
 You, too. 
 We better get up there fast. 
 Stay calm, stay cool, Charoca. 
 In with the cool. (inhales deeply) 
 Out with the hot. (exhales loudly) 
 (Elena and Naomi talking) 
 Stop. That one. 
 No, the other way. 
 You just had it the other way. 
 You again? 
 It's not what you think. 
 Look. 
 You brought them back. 
 Sandy, Crystal, I missed you so much. 
 Oh, Jasper. 
 He named his rocks? 
 You got a problem with that? 
 Not me. 
 
 
 
 Hi, Sandy. 
 That's Jasper. 
 I didn't get the chance to introduce myself before. 
 I am Crown Princess Elena. 
 You're the crown princess? 
 And you brought back my rocks. 
 That's all I wanted. 
 Thank you, Your Majesty. 
 You're welcome. 
 Most people don't treat me with that kind of respect. 
 Well, they should. 
 When people look at me, all they see is a monster. 
 But just because I'm made of rock doesn't mean I don't have feelings.

 So you're not a bad guy after all. 
 You just have serious anger management issues. 
 Yes, but I'm working on that. 
 You know, breathing exercises, gardening, let's see, meditating. 
 You guys, I'm trying. 
 Well, don't worry, Charoca. 
 Nobody will treat you like a monster ever again. 
 Seize that monster! 
 What? Esteban. Stop! 
 He's not a monster. 
 I thought you wanted to be my friend, but you were just setting me up for a sneak attack. 
 That's not true. I'm trying to help. 
 Uh-oh, he's getting angry. 
 I'll save you, princess. 
 Grab him. 
 No. Leave him alone. 
 They want a monster, I'll give them a monster. 
 Fall back. 
 Wait. No. Where are you going? 
 Ow! 
 Princesa, hop on. 
 It's okay, guys. It's gonna be okay. 
 Sorry. They just make me so angry! 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 And you are helping her? 
 We were doing fine until... 
 You defied the vote of the council, Elena. 
 And now I must inform them of the fiasco you created. 
 Attacking him is what caused all this. 
 The lava's coming! 
 It's headed right for the schoolhouse. 
 I have an idea, Your Majesty. 
 We can build a barricade to divert the lava away from the school. 
 But how can we put it up so quickly? 
 With a squadron of the bravest royal guards in the kingdom. 
 And me. 
 And us. 
 Okay then, let's save the village. 
 That should do it. 
 Here it comes. 
 Everybody back! 
 It's holding! 
 We did it! 
 Yes! 
 No! 
 The lava. My house, my friends. 
 We've gotta help Charoca. 
 How? 
 I got you, Jaden, Gemma. 
 I am sorry, guys. I lost my temper, and now, the monfuego is erupting. 
 I gotta cool down. 
 Out with the hot, in with the cool. 
 Stay calm, stay cool. 
 That's it. 
 Feel better, guys? 
 No. The lava! 
 Maybe I can cool the lava down like I did you guys, if I stay cool, Okay, stay cool. Stay calm. 
 Out with the hot, in with the cool. 
 Out, hot, in, cool. 
 Out hot! 
 Elena : Charoca! 
 Now! 
 Bull's-eye! 
 You... saved my house. 
 Well, I did spend a long time fixing up that garden. 
 (chuckles) 
 And it's my duty as princess to protect everyone who lives in Avalor. 
 Including you. 
 The monfuego stopped erupting. 
 Uh, we've still got a problem. 
 Look! 
 Elena : We saved the school, but the lava is headed straight for the village. 
 We have to get more water. 
 There's no time. 
 I did this. 
 Because they attacked you. 
 It doesn't matter. I lost my cool, and now, they're all in danger because of me. 
 I can save them. 
 Charoca? What are you doing? 
 Charoca! 
 The lava's coming. Everyone, get back! 
 I can stop this lava... if I stay cool. 
 You are a calm, cool Charoca. 
 Out with the hot, in with the cool. 
 Stay calm, stay cool. 
 Stay calm, stay cool. 
 Stay calm, stay cool. 
 Stay calm, stay... 
 The monster saved us! 
 He's no monster. 
 He's a hero. 
 Charoca! 
 Charoca? 
 Oh. 
 (rocks crackling) 
 (gasps) 
 (laughing) I stayed cool. 
 You did. 
 You really did. 
 (people cheering) 
 Um, sorry we took your rocks, Señor Charoca. 
 That's okay. Want a monfuego-mallow? 
 Ready? 
 Aha! There she is. 
 Princess Elena disobeyed our vote, and took matters into her own hands. 
 I was only trying to do what I thought was right. 
 And she was right. 
 We were wrong about Charoca. 
 You may have been right this time, Elena, but the law is the law. 
 And as Crown Princess, you must respect the decision of the Grand Council. 
 But sometimes, the heart knows best, Francisco. 
 She has a point. Just sayin'. 
 I'll tell you what, abuelo. 
 Next time, I'll do what the council decides, if you promise to have a more open heart. 
 That I can promise. 
 Okay then. 
 Enough royal business. 
 We're missing the party. 
 We're not missing the party. The party's missing us! 
 Princess Elena. 
 I thought my only friends in the world were my rocks, but, um... looks like I was wrong. 
 So this is for you, For being my friend. 
 Thank you. 
 What a lovely rock. 
 It's a caldorose. 
 It only grows on the monfuego. 
 A special flower for a special princess. 
 Rough on the outside, but beautiful on the inside. 
 Just like you. 
 (villagers cheering)
