 *ELENA OF AVALOR* Season 03 Episode 07 Episode Title: "Flower of Light" 
 "Flower of Light." 
 These are the best altars I've ever seen. 
 Especially mine! 
 Elena? What is it? 
 Oh, I guess I should've told you before. 
 I can see spirits on Día de los Muertos. 
 No. Way. 
 Do you see them now? 
 They just started arriving. 
 So they can see our altars. 
 I hope mami and papi come! 
 Me, too. 
 This is the year, it has to be. 
 Nobody made me an altar again, Sanza. 
 Hate to say I told you so. 
 Everyone else who passed away gets honored with an altar on Día de los Muertos. 
 Why not me? 
 You are absolutely right, Guillermo. 
 It's not fair. 
 And I say if you're not getting honored today, then nobody should. 
 Let's bring the celebration to a screeching halt. 
 Ay! 
 Will you keep it down?! 
 This is a cemetery, not a fiesta! 
 Huh? 
 Felicia? 
 What?! 
 Aah! 
 Feli?! 
 Eli?! 
 The altar, the picture. 
 I thought for a second you were... 
 Hmph! Not yet. 
 You look exactly the same as when we were kids. 
 Well, that's only because I was trapped in that magical amulet for 41 years. 
 I missed you, Eli. 
 I missed you, too. 
 Remember when we got lost exploring the Crystal Caverns? 
 Or when we raced up the Xolo Mountain? 
 How could I forget? I won. 
 Ay, we were inseparable back then. 
 But we're together now. 
 And we have so much catching up to do. 
 Like who is this? 
 My husband Ricardo. 
 Oh. This altar is for him. 
 Altar? 
 This is just the pre-altar. 
 This is the altar. 
 Wow. This is impressive. 
 Just like my Ricardo. 
 We met at a dance competition. 
 He did the Zapateado like no one else. 
 Oh, yeah, that was your favorite. 
 How does it go again? 
 Ugh! I'm done with all that nonsense. 
 But, Feli, you used to love to dance. 
 It made you so happy. 
 My picture! 
 Someone stole it! 
 Why would anyone steal... 
 No! 
 What is going on? 
 Señor, please! 
 Ooh! 
 Isa? What are you doing with that? 
 Uh... I don't know. 
 One moment, I'm singing, and the next, a weird feeling came over me and I had to take it. 
 Hmm... 
 Don't you want the flowers from that altar? 
 Ahem. 
 I know what you guys are up to. 
 Weird. 
 It's almost like she can see us, Sanza. 
 That's because I can. 
 I don't know why you two are causing trouble, but you better stop it right now before I call my friends from the Spirit World. 
 Ooh, the Spirit World. 
 There's an even bigger party for us to crash there. 
 Let us depart, Guillermo. 
 Adiós. 
 Uh-oh. Zuzo! 
 Hiya, Princess. Hope this won't take long. 
 I'm already fashionably late to the Spirit World's Día de los Muertos celebration. 
 Eli? Oh, thank goodness! 
 You found my portrait! 
 What do you know about a spirit named Guillermo and a chanul named Sanza? 
 Uh, nada. 
 Hmm, I don't know Guillermo, but Sanza is a Rogue Chanul... 
 A spirit guide who's turned bad and tries to talk folks into misbehaving. 
 A Rogue Chanul? 
 Eli? You feeling okay? 
 Oh, sorry. I was talking to my spirit guide. 
 Only I can see him. 
 And, well, I can see other spirits, too, but only on Día de los Muertos. 
 Hmm, you can see spirits? 
 Do you see my Ricardo? 
 Umm... Wait, why are you asking about Guillermo and Sanza? 
 Because they were just here, wreaking havoc at our Día de los Muertos celebration. 
 Oh, so that's why everyone was acting strange. 
 And then they ran off saying they were going to crash an even bigger party in the Spirit World. 
 Okay, I better go stop those two before they ruin the most important holiday of the year. 
 Wait, I want to help! 
 Let me go to the Spirit World with you. 
 Spirit World? 
 Take me, too! 
 Uh, are you sure about that? 
 Yes. It'll be a real adventure, like when we were kids. 
 And I'll finally get to see my Ricardo again. 
 Okay. How about it, Zuzo? 
 You know I'm not supposed to. 
 But... since this is an emergency and all, next stop, the Spirit World. 
 Hold on! 
 Ohh! 
 Oh! Good, you can see me now. 
 I'm Zuzo. 
 The portal between the Spirit World and the human world is only open to the spirit public on Día de los Muertos. 
 So there tends to be a lot of holiday traffic. 
 Whoa! Stay in your lane! 
 Ricardo, is that you? 
 Ay, no. Where is my Ricardo? 
 I promise we'll find him, but first we have to stop Sanza and Guillermo before they cause any more trouble. 
 Of course, Eli. Right. 
 Not a bad view, right? 
 And take a look at this. 
 Whoa, that wasn't here before! 
 It's the Flor de Luz. 
 It blooms every year on Día de los Muertos. 
 Ah, I can't wait to see my family. 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 Did you see that? More flowers are blooming. 
 That's because joy makes La Flor de Luz grow. 
 And speaking of joy, next stop, the Spirit Village Branch. 
 Sanza and Guillermo must be here somewhere. 
 Let's split up and ask if anyone's seen them. 
 Good idea. 
 Have you seen this handsome man? 
 You asked for it, you got it, Sanza. 
 Copal incense made from the Dark Branches of the Spirit Tree. 
 Now remember, one of you has to keep the incense burning while the other gathers the smoke. 
 Mmm. 
 Good news! We got a tip. 
 Oh, uh, good. Lead the way. 
 I-I-I don't know. 
 Are you sure this isn't going too far? 
 Too far? Wasn't it you that wanted to bring this celebration to a screeching halt? 
 Um... I suppose. 
 Then I suppose we have work to do. 
 They're getting away! 
 Shh! 
 Okay, Zuzo, you fly ahead and cut them off. 
 Feli and I will... Feli? 
 Oh! 
 I'm sensing her heart really isn't in this. 
 You go after them. I'll track down Felicia. 
 Have you? You? 
 How about you? 
 What are you doing? 
 This is my only chance to see Ricardo again. 
 I told you we would look for Ricardo after Guillermo and Sanza. 
 Can't you wait? 
 No, Eli. I can't. 
 You don't know what it's like to lose someone so close to you. 
 Feli. You know I do. 
 I lost both my parents. 
 I miss them every single day. 
 It's not easy living without them. 
 But I know they wouldn't want me to dwell on the past and be sad. 
 They want me to live in the present and be happy. 
 That's just it. 
 There's nothing that can make me happy anymore. 
 I found our troublemakers. C'mon! 
 Ooh! 
 This is a Spirit Guide arrest! Oof! 
 Well, if it isn't my old pal, Zuzo. 
 My, my, my, you're looking absolutely magical today. 
 Oh, thank you. I do what I can, but your sweet talk won't work on me. 
 And you won't be causing any more trouble here. 
 Trouble? We were just decorating. 
 We know what you were up to back in the human world. 
 No more tricks. 
 Come quietly, and maybe I won't have you banished. 
 But before you go, have you seen my husband Ricardo? 
 Felicia. 
 Let's go, Sanza. 
 Thank you for the invitation, Zuzo, but Guillermo and I still have to add our finishing touches. 
 Look out! 
 Hold on! 
 Whoa! Aah! 
 Whoopsie! 
 Whoooaa! 
 Whoa! 
 Got ya! Oh! 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 Oh, good. You're okay. 
 Let's get 'em. 
 Aaaah! 
 Sanza, help! 
 Adiós. 
 Huh? 
 Oh, how 'bout that. 
 Okay, you two keep any eye on him, I'll go after Sanza. 
 Hello? 
 Mami! Papi! 
 Elenita! 
 I can feel you. 
 Because we're all in the Spirit World. 
 It has been far too long. 
 We heard about the troublemakers and thought we'd lend a hand. 
 Felicia? Is that you? 
 Queen Lucia. King Raul. 
 It's so wonderful to see you together again. 
 You two used to be joined at the hip! 
 Your Zapateado could get anyone on the dance floor. 
 I assume you're a famous dancer now. 
 I was... once. 
 But after my husband Ricardo came here, I never danced again. 
 Excuse me. 
 Well, looky here. A royal reunion. 
 Where's Sanza? 
 I lost him. 
 Oh! Guillermo! 
 What are you and Sanza up to? 
 Y'know, everyone here's got familia and friends who love them, altars to visit. 
 Me, I've got nothing. 
 In life, it was just me and my music. 
 That was the only thing that ever made me happy, so I never got close to anyone. 
 Nobody's ever made me an altar. 
 Nobody honors my memory. 
 All this day does is remind me of what I don't have. 
 
 
 
 So I guess I figured, why should all the other spirits get to be happy? 
 I know what will cheer you up. 
 Who said that? 
 You! 
 I know where he is. 
 You... You do? 
 Ta-ha. Of course. 
 I know every spirit in this world. 
 But the question is, what are you willing to do to see him again? 
 Anything. 
 Good answer. 
 What were you going to do? 
 Where did Sanza go? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 He needed someone to help him and you caught me, so he can't do it anymore. 
 Do what exactly? What was your plan? 
 Uh, we were going to close the portal to the human world. 
 We have to stop Sanza. 
 So I just have to keep the incense burning, and then you'll bring me to Ricardo? 
 Who? 
 Uh... absolutely. 
 Let's begin. 
 Look! 
 We're too late! 
 The portal is sealed. 
 No more spirits can visit their altars today. 
 Isn't that marvelous? 
 It's terrible! 
 How could you do this? 
 You mean, how could we do this? 
 But I-I-I didn't know. 
 I just wanted to see Ricardo. 
 Never heard of him, but he sounds like a catch. 
 Now to enjoy the fruits of our labor. 
 Adiós. 
 Nooo! 
 Feli? 
 Sanza tricked me. 
 He said he would take me to Ricardo, but he lied. 
 All I wanted was to see my Ricardo one more time. 
 Well, now you'll have plenty of time to look for him, because you're trapped in the Spirit World forever. 
 What? 
 No, no. 
 I didn't want any of this. 
 I wish I could take it all back. 
 I'm so sorry, Eli. 
 There has to be something we can do. 
 Look at everyone.

 May I have the next dance? 
 You're under spirit arrest. 
 Noooooo! 
 Ha ha ha! 
 You still got it, Feli! 
 Only because you helped me find it, Eli. 
 I was so caught up in the past that I forgot about the present. 
 Me too! 
 I haven't played music in so long, I forgot how good it feels! 
 Ha ha ha! Hey. 
 Come jam with us, Guillermo! 
 I should probably turn myself in. 
 Sanza was the one to blame. 
 You go on and jam. 
 Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeaahh! 
 Ricardo! 
 Felicia! 
 Cariño! Why are you here? 
 Are you... 
 No, no! I'm just visiting. 
 It's a long story. 
 Oh, what a relief. 
 I went back to look for you, but you were gone. 
 Then when I tried to return, the way was blocked. 
 Well, we're together now. 
 And I wish I could stay here forever, but... 
 I still have some living to do. 
 I want to dance again. 
 Si, mi amor. 
 Every year when I'd visit, I missed your dancing. 
 All I ever wanted was to see you happy again. 
 There you are! 
 Who's the altar for? 
 Someone who should be remembered. 
 Shh! 
 This is a fiesta! 
 Play louder! 
 Louder, I say!
