 Finder keeper I'll take those. 
 Hey, those are my coconuts. 
 Get your own lunch. 
 I just did. ( Laughs ) 
 Too slow. 
 Huh? 
 Skylar! 
 Give me that! 
 Back to you, Luna! 
 Say what now? 
 ( All gasp ) 
 ( cracking sound ) 
 Oh, it's just a little crack. 
 Now, Migs, look what your coconuts did. 
 My coconuts?! 
 You... her... 
 Uh, guys, there's something down here. 
 Buried treasure. 
 Buried treasure? 
 Outta my way! 
 Whoa. What are you gonna do with treasure? 
 You can't even handle coconuts. 
 No, we better alert Princess Elena. 
 It's going to be a busy day. 
 I can help you log in the ships, Dad. 
 Elena : Naomi! 
 Majesty. 
 Harbor Master. 
 We have an emergency Grand Council meeting. 
 The jaquins found buried treasure. 
 Oh! Um... 
 Go on. 
 Grand Council needs you. 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 Elena : Oh, great. The rest of the council is here. 
 Professor Mendoza is examining the site right now. 
 Allow me, professor. 
 Oh, thanks, chancellor. 
 Thank you for coming down here on such short notice, Professor Mendoza. 
 What can you tell us about the treasure? 
 We have a lot more on our hands than buried treasure. 
 It's an ancient Maruvian chamber, the likes of which I've never seen. 
 Really? That is so cool. 
 It is not cool if you're trying to get to the Via Mercado. 
 This is a busy street. 
 I recommend we remove anything valuable and repair the road immediately. 
 The road doesn't matter, chancellor. 
 What matters is our history. 
 The Maruvians lived here for hundreds of years before us, then disappeared without a trace. 
 I've spent my life documenting every Maruvian ruin in my atlas of Maru, but this chamber is special. 
 We should take the time to properly explore it. 
 Do you expect us to stop everything and dig up an old ruin in the middle of the city? 
 I don't expect you to do anything. 
 I can dig it up myself. 
 I'm with Professor Mendoza. 
 If we can discover something new about our past, it's worth the traffic jam. 
 Miss Turner, you are hardly qualified to decide such matters. 
 She's on the Grand Council just like you. 
 But she's not just like me, or the rest of us. 
 You are not a royal. 
 You know nothing about governing a kingdom. 
 You have no degrees, no accomplishments. 
 Until Elena put you on the council, you were merely a girl from the port. 
 Esteban! Naomi is perfectly qualified to be on the council. 
 In fact, not only are we going to explore the ruin, but I'm putting Naomi in charge of the dig. 
 Both : You are?! 
 That's right. Naomi will work with Professor Mendoza starting, um... when can you start, Professor Mendoza? 
 First thing in the morning. 
 First thing in the morning. 
 Then I suppose I will see you tomorrow. 
 Someone will need to clean up whatever mess Naomi makes. 
 Don't worry about Esteban. 
 I'll come to the dig, too, if it'll make you feel better. 
 What is it? 
 All that stuff Esteban said about me not belonging on the Grand Council... what if he's right? 
 He's wrong, Naomi, and tomorrow, you're gonna prove it to him. 
 You're right. 
 I will. 
 See you tomorrow.

 Of course I believe it.

 Naomi, you're already someone special to me. 
 After tomorrow, I will be to everyone. 
 Where's Naomi? 
 Late, apparently. 
 Good morning, team. 
 I got here early to take a look around. 
 Let's get started. 
 So what's the deal with this crystal wall? 
 Ah, you have a good eye. 
 That's what makes this chamber so special. 
 Should we see what's behind it? 
 Ah, first things first. 
 Carefully chip away a small section so we can examine it. 
 Right. Good idea. 
 And I'll start translating these glyphs. 
 You see, Miss Turner, glyphs are pictures that they used instead of words. 
 I know what glyphs are, thanks. 
 So what do you want us to do, Naomi? 
 Maybe you and Esteban can gather up all the relics. 
 You see, relics are what we call old stuff. 
 Okay. Sounds like a plan. 
 Here's something. 
 This is a very rare glyph. 
 I've only seen it a few times before. 
 Aha! It's a duende. 
 A what? 
 Duendes are mischievous elves from another realm, or so the legend goes. 
 It is said that three duende brothers came to Avalor many years ago causing mayhem wherever they went. 
 Finally, a wizard caught the duende brothers, and locked them in three separate chambers to keep them apart. 
 No, no, no. You are doing it all wrong. 
 It will take us a year to get through the wall if you go that slowly. 
 You heard what Professor Mendoza said. 
 Yes, but I took an archaeology class as part of my  royal  training. 
 So if you want to see what's behind that wall any time soon, you'll hand over your pick. 
 ( Scoffs )Fine. Here. 
 Now, watch and learn. 
 What did you do? 
 ( Giggling ) 
 Did you hear that? 
 It sounded like giggling. 
 ( Jabbering excitedly ) 
 What is that? 
 It's a duende. This must be one of the chambers. 
 Hey! Ow! 
 We have to catch him before he frees his brothers. 
 The other two chambers are right here in Avalor City. 
 ( Jabbering ) 
 My atlas! Don't let him get away! 
 Where'd he go? 
 They can turn invisible. 
 I see the book on the ladder. 
 ( laughing ) 
 He can use my atlas to find his brothers. 
 We have to stop him or... ( crashing ) he'll cause chaos all over the kingdom. 
 Come on. 
 
 
 
 Hey, look at these golden glyphs. 
 Now is not the time to look at pictures. 
 We have a crisis on our hands, thanks to you. 
 Me? You were the one who broke the wall. 
 Ah, but you are the one in charge, are you not? 
 Do not worry, Miss Turner. 
 As I said yesterday, I will clean up your mess. 
 How are we gonna find him? 
 I know where the other two ruins are. 
 We can take the royal coach. 
 Don't worry, Elena. I'll make sure we catch that duende. 
 ( Speaking excitedly ) 
 There he is. 
 Now look here, duende. 
 I am Chancellor Esteban, and I command you to stop this instant. 
 Where's he going? 
 To the pyramid. 
 We must hurry. Follow me, around the pond. 
 No, wait. There's a quicker way. 
 A rowboat? Are you serious? 
 I live at a harbor. I know how to row fast. 
 She's in charge. 
 Hm! 
 Wow, you do row fast. 
 Ooh, this could come in handy. 
 As could this. 
 Rest assured, everyone, I will apprehend the duende. 
 Wait. We should make a plan. 
 No, we do not have time. 
 He could release his brother any minute. 
 Esteban, stop. Esteban. 
 Get away from that pyramid, duende, and give me back the atlas. 
 I, uh, retrieved your book. 
 ( Crashing ) 
 Oh, no! 
 Huh? 
 I'll get him. 
 No, let me. 
 I have excellent aim. 
 ( Duendes speaking excitedly ) 
 Gotcha! Someone grab the atlas. 
 What are they... 
 Where are they? 
 They're gone. 
 As I said before, Naomi should never have been put in charge. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I told you we needed a plan, and you didn't listen. 
 She's right, and the duende used your iron rod to get in here. 
 Anyway, with two duendes on the loose, we have no choice but to alert the palace. 
 That'll be easy, since the third duende chamber is beside the palace waterfall. 
 I know a shortcut. 
 Hey, you guys should really take a look at these glyphs. 
 Ay no, again with the pictures. 
 What is it? 
 I saw the same thing in the last duende chamber. 
 Whatever it says was important enough to etch in solid gold. 
 You're right. It's a warning. 
 What kind of warning? 
 It says the three duendes are gatekeepers, each one bearing a magic gem. 
 When all three gems are put together, they form a key that will unlock a tunnel to the duende world, allowing hundreds, no, wait, thousand of duendes to enter Avalor. 
 So this situation is actually worse than we thought. 
 They aren't just a nuisance, they want to invade Avalor, and we've given them a head start. 
 Well done, Miss Turner. 
 We can still stop them. 
 They haven't freed the third duende yet. 
 You said you knew a shortcut to the last chamber. 
 Sure do. Follow me. 
 Here we are. 
 I don't see a ruin. 
 You're standing on it. 
 I thought it was just a carved slab, but it must be a door. 
 Well, it looks like we beat the duendes here. 
 So how do we stop them? 
 I will summon the Royal Guard. 
 They may not get here in time, and the duendes can go all invisible on us, so that makes it even trickier. 
 Do you have a better idea? 
 Huh. My father used to say catching spiny lobster is all about figuring out which hot spot they'll be at, and having the right trap. 
 That would be great advice, if we were spiny lobster fishing. 
 But we are fishing, for duendes. 
 And we're standing on the perfect hot spot. 
 Okay. So what should we do? 
 Hm. I can build a trap with the net and these branches, hang it from the tree with those vines. 
 Then we hide in the bushes and drop it on the duendes when they get to the hatch. 
 Ha! That will never work. 
 I guess we'll find out. 
 ( Excited jabbering ) 
 Psst. Hey. What are you waiting for? 
 Drop the trap. 
 Not yet. His brother's not there. 
 He's probably there but invisible. 
 You're going to miss them both. 
 No, I won't. 
 I'm not waiting. 
 Esteban! 
 I got you, duendes. 
 ( jabbering ) 
 Huh? But where is the other one? 
 ( Excited jabbering ) 
 It's the third duende brother. 
 You duendes! 
 No, wait. The net. 
 It's too steep. 
 I was wrong, Naomi. You are a great leader. 
 You are leading thousands of duendes right into our kingdom. 
 This is what we get for following her. 
 But you haven't been following her, Esteban. 
 You were the one who let the first duende out, you ignored Naomi at the park, and you sprung the trap too early. 
 The problem hasn't been Naomi; It's been you. 
 Yeah, I guess you were never  royally  trained in listening. 
 It doesn't matter what Esteban did. 
 I was the one in charge, so I'm the one to blame. 
 I was in such a rush to make a big discovery, to do something special, that I let him knock the wall down. 
 And then I didn't stand up to him, like a good leader would've. 
 I wanted to prove that I belonged on the Grand Council, but it turns out, I'm just a girl from the port. 
 You belong on the Grand Council as much as any of us. 
 You're smart, brave, resourceful. 
 I mean, you were the one who had all the good ideas when it came to catching the duendes. 
 What good will all that do us now, stuck down here? 
 Because I'm counting on you to figure out a way to get us out of here. 
 We need you, Naomi. 
 The kingdom needs you. 
 Okay. I need the net and a piece of crystal. 
 You guys still owe me a bag of coconuts, ya know. 
 Hey, what's going on down there? 
 I don't know, but it looks like fun. 
 I mean, trouble. 
 We better inform the palace. 
 What is cutting the net going to accomplish? 
 This. 
 Now it's twice as long. 
 Yeah! Nice toss. 
 Looks like Naomi knows what she's doing, when you let her do it. 
 Okay, let's get outta here. 
 Hey, look, it's Elena. 
 Princess, we saw these weird little elves down at the port. 
 More like little thieves. 
 They were making off with a bunch of ropes and cargo hooks. 
 Why would they need that stuff? 
 It's climbing gear. 
 There's only one Maruvian ruin on a mountain so steep that you need climbing equipment. 
 The Sun Cliff. 
 That must be where the doorway to their world is. 
 Oh, yeah. They're going to unleash all the duendes on Avalor. 
 We need a ride to the Sun Cliff. 
 Hop on. 
 Do you think we beat them here? 
 ( Smashing sound ) 
 Nope. 
 Naomi : There they are! 
 ( Jabbering excitedly ) 
 Esteban : They are coming. 
 According to the legend, if we remove the gem key, it will close the tunnel. 
 Great. You and Professor Mendoza go for the key. 
 I need you to help me get their climbing ropes. 
 Why? 
 You'll see why. Just do it. 
 All right, let's round up some duendes. 
 Gotcha! 
 Esteban, help me. 
 Yes! 
 Get back here. 
 Esteban, hurry. 
 Heave ho! 
 Pull out the gem key. 
 We did it! 
 Where'd you learn to lasso like that? 
 At the port. 
 You know, that was some toss, chancellor. 
 If you ever need extra work, you should come by the harbor. 
 But you and I will have no time for that sort of thing, Miss Turner. 
 We have far too much work to do on the Grand Council, and you are still in charge of an important excavation, are you not? 
 Luna, take us down. 
 You got it. 
 Dad. 
 Naomi. 
 How did it go today? 
 Did you make a big discovery? 
 Yeah. I thought I needed to prove to everyone that I belonged on the Grand Council, but the truth is, I just needed to prove it to myself. 
 And did you? 
 I did. 
 Good, because I've known you're special since the day you were born. 
 It's about time you figured it out. 
 Oh, Dad! 
 Come on, Naomi. 
 We have to report back to the palace. 
 I sort of saved the kingdom from a duende invasion. 
 ( Chuckles ) That's my Naomi.
