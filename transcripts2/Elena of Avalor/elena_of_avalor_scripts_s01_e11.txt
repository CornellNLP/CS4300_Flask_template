 Looks great,  Abuela. 
 Feliz Navidad,  everyone. 
 Elena,  Navidad  is not for two days. 
 Then happy almost  Navidad,  cousin. 
 Mm,  buñuelos. 
 One at a time, Isa. 
 Princess Elena, the guests have arrived. 
 Cristina! 
 Isabel! 
 I made you this garland. 
 Thank you. I made something for you, too. 
 Go ahead. Open it. 
 It goes on your wheelchair, like this. 
 Oh, Isa, I love it! 
 I was thinking we could use it. 
 To make the castle piñata. 
 It's a family tradition. 
 Okay. 
 Princess Elena, it is so kind of you to have us over again. 
 Isabel's been excited all week. 
 Can I get you anything? 
 Actually, I have something for you. 
 Our village would be honored if you and your family celebrated  Nochebuena  with us tomorrow. 
 Oh! 
 Can we go, Elena? Please! 
 It is a kind offer, but we always spend the night before  Navidad  in the palace. wow! That doesn't mean we couldn't do something different this year, right? 
 I don't know... 
 Why we wouldn't say yes to such a lovely invitation, Francisco. 
 So we can go? 
 Um, Princess Elena. 
 You have a few other visitors. 
 Uh, more than a few. 
 Naomi? 
 Merry Christmas, Elena. 
 Mateo, Rafa, Carmen, Julio, Doña Paloma? 
 What are you all doing here? 
 On behalf of Avalor City, I have come to invite you to our  Navidad  party tomorrow night. 
 That's why we're here, too. 
 We're having a festival at the harbor. 
 The boats will be all lit up. 
 Or you could come to our  Nochebuena  celebration in the old square. 
 It is very traditional. 
 We sing all the old songs. 
 Wow! That's a lot of invitations. 
 But we're going to Cristina's village, right? 
 Before you decide, Your Majesty, please let us tell you how we celebrate the night before  Navidad.

 So which celebration will you attend, Your Majesty? 
 I'm, uh... going to need a few minutes to think it over. 
 Maybe we can go to all the celebrations. 
 You know, spend a little time in each place. 
 I wish we could,  Mi Hija,  but there isn't enough time to go to every one. 
 And it is our family tradition to spend the night before  Navidad  in the palace. 
 It is what we have always done. 
 But Cristina is my best friend. 
 If I only got one gift for  Navidad,  it would be to spend it with her. 
 Um, Princess Elena, they have asked if you have come to a decision yet. 
 No. Ah! 
 Huh. 
 Looks like a party down there. 
 ( Gasps ) Maybe we can have them all come back to the palace tomorrow night and celebrate together. 
 How thoughtful. 
 And impossible. 
 The palace is not big enough to throw a party for the entire city. 
 It doesn't have to be here. 
 It can be someplace with more room. 
 Like the park. 
 Yes, the park! 
 That's perfect. Come on, Isa. 
 Let's go tell them the good news. 
 So I've decided to accept all your invitations. 
 Huh? 
 What? 
 And how is that going to work? 
 We're all going to celebrate together in... 
 ( imitates drum roll ) 
 Castillo Park! 
 Isn't that great? 
 Hmm. I think it's a splendid idea. 
 We will finally get to share our  Navidad  traditions with one another. 
 Well done, princess. 
 Well done. 
 Oh, thank you, Doña Paloma. 
 No, thank you. 
 What are we all waiting for? 
 We have a  Navidad  fiesta to prepare for. 
 And if any of you need any last-minute decorations, my emporium at the  Villa Mercado  is open late tonight and early tomorrow. 
 We're going to have so much fun. 
 We're going to make so much money. 
 ♪♪ 
♪♪ 
 Carmen, I have an early  Navidad  gift for you. 
 A new skillet! 
 Thank you, Julio. 
 According to my calculations, it will take approximately... twenty-one good whacks to break open this piñata. 
 Mmm, I say 24. 
 Hi, girls. Need any help? 
 ( Horse whinnies ) Oh! 
 Elena : Wow! 
 A boat?! 
 They brought a boat?! 
 Check out that boat, Mama. 
 Everyone celebrates in their own way, I suppose. 
 Shall we practice? 
 Sure. Marlena. 
 From the top. 
 ( Playing festive tune ) 
 ♪ Hacia belén va una burra rin rin... ♪ 
 Ah, that's it. 
 Get it nice and hot. 
 Ow! 
 ( Coughing ) Carmen, the smoke. 
 Dad, we have to move the boat. 
 Fernando : Your boat is scaring our goats. 
 Oh, no. The goats are trampling our flowers. 
 Now stop! 
 Shoo, shoo! 
 Uh-oh. I'll be right back. 
 Princess Elena, thank goodness you are here. 
 We have to get rid of these goats. 
 I think it's part of the villagers' tradition. 
 I'll just bring them back over there. 
 I'll help you. 
 Come on, goats. 
 Please. 
 Where did all our customers go? 
 I don't know, Doña. To the park? 
 Already? We should've sold more decorations. 
 We've done pretty well. 
 Pretty well isn't good enough. 
 Hmm. Looks like I'll have to drum up some more business. 
 ( Singing in Spanish continues loudly ) 
 Can you get them to play softer? 
 Um... what was that? 
 ( Fireworks exploding ) 
 All right. Ha ha! 
 The fireworks are good to go. 
 The fireworks have to go. 
 And the goats. 
 And their boat. 
 And their grill. 
 I am sorry, princess, but this isn't going to work. 
 Perhaps we should all go back to our neighborhoods. 
 No, I don't wanna go. 
 Wait. Let's not give up just yet. 
 I'm sure we can figure this out. 
 How? 
 A parade. 
 Doña Paloma? 
 We should have a parade. 
 You can all have your own floats, and no one will get in each others' way. 
 Plus, we'll spread holiday joy across the entire city. 
 That's an excellent idea, Doña. 
 Yes, I know. 
 And my emporium has everything you need to build the perfect float, on sale, today only. 
 So what do you all think? 
 I love parades. 
 Me, too. 
 I can't think of a better way to show off your  Navidad  traditions for everyone to see. 
 She makes a good point. 
 Yeah, sounds like fun. 
 We can hand out Tamales. 
 We can play our songs. 
 With no goats. 
 All right then. Let's have a parade. 
 After you stop by my store for the best Navi-deals in town. 
 Princess Elena, if we go all the way to our village to build a float, we won't get back in time. 
 So we can't ride in the parade? 
 Tell you what. 
 Isabel and I are gonna help you build the float. 
 I'm sure we have everything we need up at the palace. 
 How does that sound? 
 Great. 
 Let's go design it. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 ( Girls laughing ) 
 Thank you, Your Highness. 
 It's my pleasure. 
 Huh. Your parade idea worked. 
 We made more money today than in the last three months. 
 Why stop there? 
 Let's make more than we have all year. 
 ♪♪ 
 I love what you've done with your float, Rafa. 
 Thank you, Doña. 
 Between you and me, I think your  Navidad  tradition is the best of them all. 
 But you need more flowers to make it really eye-catching. 
 And with more candles, you will literally outshine the others. 
 Princess Elena might even have you lead the parade. 
 I didn't know she was choosing a float to lead the parade. 
 ( Chuckles slyly ) Neither does she. 
 I mean, how else will we decide who goes first? 
 Perhaps Doña is right. 
 Yeah. 
 What's wrong with our float? 
 Nothing. 
 But there could be so much more right with it. 
 You can't have a boat without water, so why not add a fountain right over there? 
 My shop has a huge selection. 
 A fountain? 
 Seems like a bit much. 
 Not if you wanna show the others who has the best  Navidad  tradition. 
 And Elena's gonna choose the best float to lead the parade. 
 A fountain?! 
 Unbelievable. 
 And at the same time, extremely impressive. 
 They must really want Princess Elena to think their way of celebrating is the best. 
 But our way is the best. 
 Is it, because I barely see any decorations on this float. 
 And are those all the fireworks you have? 
 Carmen, we have to get more fireworks, more flowers, and more everything. 
 And... there. 
 Ah! It's beautiful. 
 Elena. 
 Oh, good. 
 You're just in time. 
 The parade is about to start. 
 What parade? 
 Wow, Mateo, your float is so... bright. 
 Thanks. 
 Surely our float should lead the parade, Don't you think, Your Majesty? 
 Uh, I guess that's fine. 
 I hadn't really thought about it. 
 ( Horse whinnying ) 
 Elena, check out our float. 
 It's totally better than theirs. 
 We should lead the parade. 
 Okay... but does it really matter who leads the parade? 
 Who wants fresh tamales? 
 Courtesy of the best float in Avalor. 
 It's a bit too much, if you ask me. 
 Our float is the finest. 
 I beg to differ. 
 Hold on. It's not a competition. 
 I agree. The old ways are clearly the best, so we should lead the parade. 
 No, not the trees! 
 Look out! 
 Ay! 
 Rafa : Fire! 
 Elena : Fire? 
 We have to put it out. 
 I'm gonna need your fountain. 
 The fireworks! Run! 
 Look out! 
 ( Gasps ) The piñata. 
 This was a mistake. 
 Let's go home, Mateo. 
 Sorry, Elena. 
 But there must be something else we can do. 
 It was nice of you to try, princess, but I think it is better this way. 
 You're still welcome to join us at the harbor, Your Majesty. 
 Come along, Naomi. 
 We have a lot of cleaning up to do. 
 Sorry it didn't work out, Elena. 
 Naomi, I... 
 We better get going. 
 What? No! 
 I don't wanna go, Dad. 
 You don't have to go. 
 We could all go back to the castle. 
 Thank you, but we should celebrate  Navidad  in our village, the way we always have. 
 ( Crying ) I wanna go home. 
 Isabel! 
 Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you can't make everyone happy. 
 It would've been fine if they didn't all try to outdo each other. 
 Some people are too set in their ways. 
 Let's go home,  Mi Hija. 
 You go on. 
 This parade idea got really out of control. 
 Hmm. 
 Naomi, why did everyone think I was choosing a float to lead the parade? 
 Doña Paloma told us. 
 That's why we bought the fountain. 
 Let me guess. At Doña's store. 
 Yeah. She gave us a great deal. 
 Ah! Did she now? 
 ( laughing ) It's going to be a happy  Navidad  after all. 
 Elena : Doña Paloma. 
 Princess Elena. 
 Shouldn't you be at the parade? 
 There is no more parade, thanks to you. 
 Whatever do you mean? 
 You got them all so competitive, they wound up crashing the floats. 
 ( Gasps ) What a shame. 
 They could always buy new decorations. 
 Navidad  isn't about who has the best decorations or traditions. 
 You're right. It should be about who has the most. 
 So that's what the holidays mean to you... 
 Money? 
 Dear, that's what every day means to me. 
 All Isabel wanted was to spend the holiday with her friend. 
 But because of your scheme, she can't. 
 Well, I do feel bad about that, so why don't you pick out a gift for her? 
 Anything in the store, free of charge. 
 Consider it a  Navidad  present from Doña Paloma. 
 Come on. I'll drive you back to the palace. 
 This whole day, everyone got so caught up in their traditions and decorations and gifts. 
 They forgot the one thing that Isabel and Cristina knew right from the start. 
 The holidays aren't about what you do. 
 They're about who you spend them with. 
 Hey. 
 Huh? 
 You know what, Gabe? 
 I think I'm gonna take Doña Paloma up on her offer. 
 We're going on a  parranda. 
 A  parranda?  How is caroling gonna help? 
 Because it's more than just caroling. 
 Everyone has to join in, and go wherever I go.
