 Come on, Elena. Hurry. 
 What's the rush, Isabel? 
 Hey, Mateo, what are you doing here? 
 Isabel's showing me the magic of science. 
 Okay, Mateo, do the globe thing. 
 So, as you know, today there's going to be a total solar eclipse. Mateo. 
 That's when the moon completely blocks the sun. 
 Now everyone at the festival will want to watch the eclipse, but looking directly at the sun hurts your eyes. 
 So I invented this. 
 Oh. It looks like a telescope. 
 It was, but I turned it into a solar projector. 
 Look! 
 So we can safely watch the eclipse on a wall. 
 There you all are. 
 Uh, it's time to go to the park for the Eclipse Festival. 
 What's that? 
 It's just an image of the sun. See? 
 Oh, good. 
 I can't wait for the eclipse to be over. 
 Why? A total solar eclipse only comes to Avalor once every 200 to 300 years. 
 We're lucky we get to see it. 
 Not if Orizaba shows up. 
 Who exactly is Orizaba? 
 Long ago, there was a moth fairy named Orizaba. 
 She lived in the shadows until, one day, she tried to bring eternal darkness to Avalor. 
 A Maruvian wizard stopped her and sent her to the spirit world. 
 But it is said she found a way to return to Avalor every solar eclipse so she can fulfill her dark plans. 
 Armando, you are the best storyteller in all of Avalor. 
 Come on. Let's get dressed for the festival, Isabel. 
 Armando. 
 It's just a story. We'll be fine. 
 Okay. 
 Now all I need is the royal scepter. 
 That's so... Ow! 
 Blazes! 
 What was that? 
 Zuzo! Zuzo! 
 Hey, princess. 
 Whoa! You must've had some fiesta. 
 I didn't have a party. 
 It was my scepter. 
 Oh, sure, blame the equipment. 
 Zuzo, a beam of light shot out of the scepter, and blasted the footstool. 
 Oh. I didn't know it could do that. 
 Neither did I. That's why I called you. 
 All right, Zuzo is on the job. 
 Now, tell me exactly what happened. 
 Okay. I picked up the scepter, and it glowed, like it does every time I pick it up, which is weird, by the way, 'cause it never did that when my father was king. 
 And then, I tripped on the footstool and, bam! 
 Hm. That's it? 
 You didn't leave any tiny little itty bitty detail out? 
 Well, when I tripped on the stool, I said "blazes." 
 Drop it, and step away from the scepter. 
 And do not say "blaze." 
 So why did it do that? 
 I don't know. 
 Let's see. It does look kind of Maruvian. 
 But it's the scepter of Avalor. 
 Well, it is now, but the kingdom of Maru was here long before Avalor, and those Maruvians made a bunch of magical objects. 
 Really? 
 Oh, yeah. So maybe your scepter is magical, too. 
 You know what? I'm gonna run this by a few friends in the spirit world. 
 Okay, I have some info. 
 That was fast. 
 All right. It turns out your scepter is definitely Maruvian. 
 So it's magical? 
 No, not on its own. 
 The scepter is channeling the magic inside you. 
 The magic you got from being in the amulet so long. 
 Wait. You're saying I have the power to destroy things with a single word? 
 It's lookin' that way. 
 But we don't know exactly how it all works yet. 
 Now, I'm gonna try and find out, but until I do, I think it's best if you don't touch the scepter again. 
 Sound good? Okay? 
 But I need it for the Eclipse Festival. 
 Yeah, and what happens if you say the wrong word, and the Eclipse Festival turns out like your footstool? 
 Ooh. Good point. Yeah, mm-hmm. 
 Right? I'll be back in two shakes of a spirit tail. 
 Great. Of all the scepters in the world, I get the one that blasts things. 
 Why couldn't it just be sparkly? 
 The eclipse is almost total. 
 Looks like it's time to give my speech. 
 My fellow Avalorans. 
 Princess Elena, you forgot your scepter. 
 Oh, um... thanks, Armando. 
 Okay, please don't do anything bad. 
 My fellow Avalorans. 
 It has been 250 years... 
 Fifty-two years. 
 252 years since the last total solar eclipse in Avalor. 
 So I am honored to spend this once-in-a-lifetime occasion with you and your families. 
 Like these torches, the spirit of Avalor always blaz... um, always burns bright. 
 Hello, Avalor! 
 The one and only Lady O. Is back. 
 What is that? 
 It's... it's... Orizaba! 
 That's right. 
 Everyone's favorite moth fairy has returned to make your darkest dreams come true. 
 She's real?! 
 You bet I'm real. 
 Stay away from my sister. 
 And who are you, dearie? 
 Elena Castillo Flores. 
 I'm the crown princess. 
 Well, Elena Castillo Flores, thank you for throwing me this fabulous party. 
 Although I must say, it's the least you can do since I am about to give you the greatest gift of all. 
 The gift of eternal night!

 What do you mean, give us the gift of night? 
 There is a magical jewel. 
 The Eye of Midnight. 
 Those pesky Maruvians hid it from me in one of their temples. 
 Last visit, I couldn't find it, but I will this time. 
 And when I place the jewel atop the sun stone...

 Okay. Everything's going to be all right. 
 There's no need to panic. 
 Run for your lives! 
 Armando! 
 What else do you know about Orizaba? 
 Is there any way to stop her? 
 The story says if she can't find the jewel before the eclipse ends, she goes back to the spirit world. 
 That only gives her ten minutes. 
 We can't just wait and hope she doesn't find it. 
 You're right, Gabe. 
 Mateo, do you have any spells that can slow her down? 
 I think so. 
 Great. Then go after her. 
 But she was heading north. 
 There are only two temples in that direction. 
 I'll check them out. 
 You can take Fuego. 
 I'm not all that good at riding horses. 
 It's easy. All you have to do is not fall off. 
 Oh! Is that all? 
 Oh! 
 Don't worry, Elena. 
 I'll take care of Orizaba. 
 Go, Fuego! 
 Assemble more guards in case she comes back. 
 We can't let her put that jewel in the sun stone. 
 Your Majesty, Orizaba's very powerful. 
 Well, Mateo has gone up against powerful magic before. 
 But nothing like Orizaba. 
 Armando, take Isabel back to the palace. 
 But what about you, Elena? 
 I'll meet you there. 
 Sorry, Zuzo. I have no choice. 
 I need to use the scepter. 
 We have to hurry, Canela. 
 Follow! 
 Well, this is the only temple I haven't checked. 
 The eye must be in here. 
 Ugh. Could there be more chambers in this place? 
 I better get moving. Time's running out. 
 Not in here. 
 Oh, Fuego, stop. 
 Come on, slow down. Stop! 
 She's here. 
 Okay. 
 You can do this. 
 
 
 
 Talact! 
 Gotcha! 
 Elena?! Oh, um... 
 Zanamo! 
 Mateo? 
 What are you doing here? It's not safe. 
 I know, but Orizaba is really powerful, and it turns out that this is a magical Maruvian scepter. 
 Really? Wait. We can talk about this later. 
 Right now, you have to go. 
 Too late. 
 Quick, hide in here. 
 What's the plan? 
 You stay hidden. I'm gonna take her by surprise. 
 But... 
 Sh! 
 Ugh, this is the last chamber. 
 The eye better be here. 
 Why can't I blast it? 
 Whatever happens, stay here. 
 Talact! 
 Nice try, dearie, but you talk too much. 
 Mateo! 
 Blaze! 
 Elena! 
 My wing! 
 Oh, it's just a scratch. 
 But that sure isn't. 
 Thank you, dearie. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm just a little dizzy. 
 Is that a piece of her wing? 
 It won't come off. 
 Finally. The Eye of Midnight. 
 You know, if it wasn't for your little magic scepter there, I might never have gotten it out. 
 Now let's get you to the sun stone. 
 No! We have to go after her. 
 Whoa. We better go back to the palace. sn. 
 There she is! Bring her down, men. 
 No, no, no. 
 That any way to treat your guest of honor? 
 Let the eternal evening begin! 
 Friends of darkness, we no longer have to live our lives hiding in the shadows. 
 Come out, wherever you are. 
 Let's make ourselves at home. 
 The eclipse should be over by now. 
 Oh, no. 
 She did it. 
 Here. Sit. 
 Zuzo was right. 
 I never should've tried to use the scepter. 
 Avalor will never see the sun again. 
 You don't know that. 
 And first, we have to figure out what's going on with you. 
 I'm fine now. 
 You don't seem fine. 
 Using that scepter did something to you. 
 I remember seeing a chapter in the Codex Maru about old magical objects. 
 Whoa. 
 Whoa what? 
 Your scepter's really old. 
 It used to be called the Scepter of Light. 
 Listen to this. 
 "The scepter can control the powers of light," both the seen and unseen, "with a single thought put into words." 
 What thoughts, what words? 
 It doesn't say, but there is a warning. 
 It says the more power you use, the more you lose. 
 What does that mean? 
 I don't know, but I have an idea how to find out. 
 I'm gonna summon Zoo. 
 Illuminara Alacazar Wayohel! 
 Oh, hey, guys. I was just about to come find you. 
 I spoke to the spirit guide who used to hang with the Maruvians, and he said the scepter saps your energy big time. 
 Like, if you use it too much, you could get hurt. 
 Oh, I'm getting the feeling you already figured this out. 
 Yeah, I used the scepter. 
 I thought we agreed you wouldn't use it until we figured out how to use it. 
 I know, but Orizaba... 
 Hold up. Orizaba? 
 The moth fairy? 
 Oh, today's the eclipse, isn't it? 
 I knew there was something I was forgetting. 
 Zuzo. 
 Yes? 
 She got the Eye of Midnight. 
 She froze the eclipse. What are we gonna do? 
 Oh, okay, First, we're gonna start with a few cleansing breaths. 
 Feels good, doesn't it? 
 Now slowly, gently, get used to living in a world of total darkness. 
 What?! 
 Oh, it's not so bad. 
 Just think of it as a nonstop slumber party. 
 There's gotta be some way to undo it. 
 A spell, some kind of magic. 
 Well, I mean, there is the, uh... you know... 
 You want me to use the scepter again? 
 He's right, Elena. 
 You saw how powerful it was at the temple. 
 But I don't know how to use it. 
 I might've picked up a few pointers while I was asking around. 
 And you said I could get hurt. 
 I sure did, and you sure could. 
 Then that's a risk I'm willing to take. 
 Elena, look at your dress. 
 It's that piece of Orizaba's wing. 
 The light from the scepter was doing something to it. 
 It was sending it back to the spirit world. 
 It takes a magical light to undo magical darkness. 
 Make the scepter glow again. 
 I don't know how. 
 You can probably put it down and pick it up, and put it down and pick it up again, and repeat as necessary. 
 No. If I'm gonna learn how to use this thing, I might as well start now. 
 According to the Codex, I just need to concentrate and say the word. 
 Sounds good. 
 But maybe you should hide behind something, Mateo. 
 Okay. 
 Glow. 
 Glow! 
 Oh... 
 It's gone. 
 Right. 
 If the scepter got rid of her wing, it could get rid of the rest of her, if you're up to it. 
 I will be. 
 Wait! 
 Where are you going? 
 To get rid of Orizaba. 
 I hope. 
 It's too dangerous. 
 Don't worry. I'll protect her. 
 Thank you, my pets. 
 Every queen needs a throne. 
 Hello again, princess. 
 I'm just making myself at home, since this is my new home. 
 What do you think? 
 Well, to be perfectly honest, I prefer a little more light. 
 Well, it's too late for that, dearie. 
 Glow. 
 What are you doing? 
 Glow! 
 No! 
 Glow! 
 No. My wings. 
 Are you okay? 
 I will be when she's gone. 
 Elena, quick, get in the coach. 
 No, no. Move the coach. 
 Oh, glorious shade. 
 Orizaba's getting away. 
 Elena! 
 My powers are returning. 
 Huh? Oh! 
 What's wrong? 
 Elena! 
 She's got Isabel. 
 Glow! 
 Glow! 
 Make it stop. 
 Glow! 
 It worked. 
 Whoa... 
 Elena, are you okay? 
 I am now. 
 I just need to rest a little bit. 
 She's awake! 
 Do you want us to close the curtains,  mija? 
 No, that's okay. The sunlight feels good. 
 Let everyone know Elena is awake. 
 Wait. How long have I been asleep? 
 Two days. 
 Two days?! 
 But are you okay now? 
 I feel... fine. 
 Elena, how'd you make your scepter glow like that? 
 Yes. Since when did you become a wizard? 
 I'm not a wizard,  abuelo. 
 But I do have a bit of magic in me from being trapped in that amulet all those years, and the scepter can channel that magic. 
 My granddaughter, a magical princess. 
 Do you have other powers? 
 Can we, um, talk about it later? 
 Right now, I can really use some more rest. 
 You heard her. Everyone out. 
 I was so worried. 
 I'm okay now. 
 Mateo, can you stay a minute? 
 What is it? 
 Thank you... for helping me figure this all out. 
 I'm the royal wizard. 
 That's my job. 
 And carrying me back to the palace. 
 Well... 
 You're so much more than the royal wizard, Mateo. 
 You're my friend. 
 Oh... 
 Yeah, I am. 
 And I'm gonna need your help. 
 We have to figure out everything the Scepter of Light can do, and how I can use it without passing out for two days. 
 And I'll need Zuzo's help, too. 
 Of course, princess. That's what spirit guides do. 
 And I promise, I won't use it again until I know exactly what I'm doing. 
 Look at us. 
 We're like a magical dream team.
