 Mmmm. 
 The list you requested, Your Majesty. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Let's see. Party hats, good. 
 Piñata, good. Chocolate fountain, great. 
 Elena, is that something you need me to take a look at? 
 Uh, no. 
 It's, uh, all looked at. 
 Princess Elena, we're ready for you. 
 Oh! 
 I did not know we were having a meeting. 
 We're not. It's, uh... a princess matter. 
 Oh, right. 
 And I am only the chancellor. 
 I'll be in the royal library collecting dust with all the old books. 
 Perfect. Have fun. 
 Ay-yi-yi. 
 She has no idea it's my birthday. 
 He has no idea we're throwing him a surprise party. 
 That was close. 
 He's off to the library now, so we're in the clear, and I have a list of everything we need. 
 I'm going to bake Esteban's favorite tres leches cake. 
 That reminds me of a story. 
 Francisco, we don't have time for this. 
 When Esteban was a boy, he was such a picky eater, and you made him the cake for his birthday, but the only way to get him to eat it... 
 Was to do the "here comes the jaquin, flying into his nest." 
 (Elena laughs) 
 So what's the plan for the music? 
 My guitar is all tuned up. 
 Can I play the birthday song with you? 
 Of course, Isabel. It will be a beautiful duet. 
 Great. And party tricks? 
 I've been practicing all week. 
 Maybe practice some more. 
 That wasn't the trick. 
 Here it goes. 
 Llévaluq! 
 Bravo! 
 Why, thank you. 
 My gift! 
 Good thing I kept the receipt. 
 Sorry. I broke my concentration. 
 I really need to work on that. 
 Well, you'll have to do it later. 
 Right now, you and I have the most important task of the day. 
 What's that? 
 Keeping Esteban away from the palace so he doesn't find out about the surprise. 
 Right. Of course. 
 We're taking him sailing. 
 Good idea. 
 Esteban loves sailing. 
 Just make sure to have him back in time for the party. 
 Aye, aye, Abuela. 
 I cannot believe everyone forgot my birthday. 
 (Blows noisemaker) 
 Happy birthday, Chancellor Esteban. 
 Oh, Higgins. No one wants to pay attention to me anymore. 
 I'm just getting older, but I have nothing to show for it. 
 That's not true. You've got loads of new gray hairs. 
 Getting old is no fun. 
 Oh, how I wish I were young again. 
 Look at me, Higgins. 
 Strong, handsome, adventurous. 
 I had so many big dreams for my life that were never fulfilled because people were always telling me what to do. 
 First my grandparents, then Shuriki. 
 Guess what, cousin. 
 Now, Elena. 
 You're taking us sailing today. 
 See what I mean? 
 As much as I would love nothing more than to spend the day chaperoning two rambunctious teenagers, I'm afraid I am booked. Right, Higgins? 
 Actually, your schedule is wide open. 
 Anchors aweigh! 
 The cruiser's all packed. 
 And I found this old nautical map in my grandfather's stuff. 
 (Coughing) 
 Oh, it must be magical. 
 Look. There's the castle. 
 And I can see my house. 
 Did you just see that? There. Tap on it. 
 Tap on it. Tap, tap, tap! 
 (Gasps) Is that... 
 The island of Santalos! 
 What are we waiting for? 
 Anchors aweigh! 
 Come on, come on. 
 We're walking, we're walking. 
 Why do you want to go to the island of Santalos? 
 It is rumored to have a body of magical water called the Fountain of Youth. 
 If you drink the water, you become younger. 
 Or so the legend says. 
 But, according to the myth, one day, it could be just off the coast of Avalor, and the next, it'll be on the other side of the world. 
 Do you realize what this means, Higgins? 
 When I drink from the fountain of youth, I will be young and strong again. 
 I'll finally start living the life I always dreamt about. 
 Prepare to cast off, everyone. 
 We are going to Santalos! 
 I'm ready to rehearse. 
 What is that? 
 A new instrument I invented. 
 It's like an accordion and a guitar put together. 
 I call it a guitardion. 
 Mmm. I see. 
 Okay. I will do the first verse, and you can come in after me.

 Please, stop! Isa! 
 Why aren't you playing? 
 I thought this was supposed to be a duet. 
 A duet is a performance where both people are heard. 
 I can only hear that... that... 
 Guitardion? 
 Yes, that. 
 And besides, the birthday song is supposed to be a sweet, heartfelt song, not an assault on the eardrums. 
 I thought it would be fun to try something different. 
 Either we play it the way it was meant to be played or not at all. 
 But I like my way. 
 I have an idea. 
 Why don't you both play for the royal staff, and let them decide which one should be played at the party? 
 A birthday song battle? 
 Okay by me. 
 If a musical duel is what you want, Isabel, then a duel you'll get. 
 According to the map, Santalos is supposed to be right here. 
 I don't get it. 
 (Sighs) I do. 
 Your magical map is maybe not so magical after all. 
 Wait. I see something over there. 
 It's Santalos! 
 (laughing) 
 Santalos?! We better drop anchor so... 
 (loud thudding) 
 Esteban : Done and done. 
 Guard the ship, Higgins. 
 I'm going ashore. 
 Wait up, Esteban. 
 You two stay here while I scout the area to make sure it is safe. 
 But I will need this. Thank you. 
 Out of my way. Shoo, shoo! 
 Where is he going? 
 I don't know, but we have to get him back to the party on time, so we better not lose him. 
 Now let's find that fountain of youth. 
 Ah! 
 There you are. 
 It's a long way down. 
 Okay. 
 (Bones cracking) 
 Ay, my hip! 
 (Groans) 
 There it is. 
 The fountain of youth. 
 (Giggles) 
 Farewell, old man. 
 No. I am still old. 
 Maybe I need some more. 
 Why is this not working? 
 Perhaps I did not drink enough. 
 Here's the map, but where's... 
 (gulping loudly) 
 Esteban! 
 What?! 
 (Both gasping) 
 No! 
 Well, what is it? 
 The fountain of youth myth is real! 
 (Gasps) 
 Look at me! 
 I'm a young man again. 
 (laughing) 
 I missed you, my friends. 
 (Making kissing sounds) 
 I must have more. 
 I'd go easy on the water. 
 It is magical. 
 Ay, Mateo, you worry too much. 
 Worrying is for old people. 
 From this day on, I will never be old again. 
 All I need to do is keep magical water on hand, and at the first sign of a wrinkle, drink some more. 
 Where are you going? 
 Wherever I please. 
 No, wait. 
 Oh, he's acting just like a... 
 Teenager. 
 Yep. Esteban, come back. 
 (Both panting) 
 Where did he go? 
 I don't know. 
 But we have to find him and get off the island by the end of the day or... 
 (Tarzan-like yells) 
 Esteban, stop. This is serious. 
 
 
 
 Whew! 
 (Chittering sounds) 
 (gasps) Elena! 
 Oh, Higgins. 
 Hey, that rowboat is royal property. 
 Put it down or I'll report you to my boss. 
 Hey, I am your boss. 
 (Voice cracks) 
 I feel weird. 
 Esteban? 
 What happened to me? 
 Why did I get younger? 
 You drank too much water. I tried to warn you. 
 Wait. Does this mean he's going to keep getting younger and younger? 
 It looks that way. 
 But I didn't wanna be this young. 
 Now everyone will tell me what to do all the time. 
 I wanna be a grown-up again. Ooh, seagulls. 
 (laughing) 
 It's getting late, and we have to leave this island before the sun goes down, or we'll vanish along with it. 
 We can't take him home like this. 
 Can we? 
 Maybe we don't have to. 
 What do you mean? 
 I saw a baby monkey eat a petal from a flower, and he instantly turned old. 
 There's a magical flower that makes you older? 
 Where? I want it. 
 It was by that waterfall. 
 There. 
 Elena : I'll go get it. 
 No. I will. 
 No, wait. 
 What if he eats too much of the flower? 
 Like he drank too much water? 
 We have to catch him. 
 I should've brought my running shoes.

 Sorry, mi amor. 
 It looks like they prefer the new way. 
 (Sighs) The people have spoken. 
 Isabel! Encore! Encore! Whoo! 
 Way to go! 
 I love it! 
 (Cheering continues) 
 Esteban, stop. 
 No way! 
 Look out! 
 I can jump it. 
 I can't get out. 
 He's in quick-sap. 
 Stop moving or you'll start sinking. 
 We'll help you. 
 Mateo, look for something he can grab on to. 
 I don't need your help. 
 I can do it myself. 
 I'm sinking! 
 Grab the branch. 
 Don't tell me what to do. 
 Do you wanna get out or not? 
 Grab it with both hands. 
 I got you. 
 You're trembling. 
 No, I'm not. I don't tremble. 
 I am brave. 
 Now where is that magical flower? 
 Hmm. Let me check the map. 
 It's over here. 
 Right through those trees. 
 (laughing) 
 Here we go again. 
 Elena : Wait! 
 Don't eat too much. 
 I'll eat as much as I want, and you can't stop me. 
 Cousin, give me the flower. 
 Mateo, grab him. 
 Esteban, come down. 
 No. 
 I'm king of the tree. 
 (Gasps) The flower! 
 Um, Elena? The sun is starting to set. 
 Being late to the party is the least of our problems. 
 Forget the party. We are going to vanish if we don't get off the island before the sun sets. 
 (Crying) 
 He's a baby now? 
 All I have to say is, I am not changing any diapers. 
 The canteen. He's slipping. 
 Esteban, I'm coming. 
 Gotcha! 
 Whew! 
 (Crying) 
 Oh, sh, sh. 
 Don't cry. 
 It's all right. 
 Everything's okay now. 
 I've got you.

 Oh. I love you, too. 
 Elena, sorry to interrupt, but look up. 
 The island is disappearing. 
 We need to go now. 
 What about the flower? We need it for Esteban. 
 There's no way to climb up there in time. 
 There must be another way. 
 Hm. There is one way. Ow! 
 What are you doing? 
 Getting that flower, I hope. 
 I haven't done this spell on anything bigger than a present, and you saw how that went. 
 Floating spell? But if it doesn't work, you could get hurt. 
 I just have to concentrate. That's all. 
 Wish me luck, just not out loud. 
 Llévaluq! 
 Oh, Mateo. 
 (Yelling) 
 Mateo! 
 Llévaluq! 
 Thanks. 
 Give it to him now. 
 We'll move quicker if he's running. 
 Open up. I hope this works. 
 What are you doing? 
 You have to eat the petal. 
 Your grandparents did say he was a picky eater as a child. 
 Now is not the time to be a picky eater. 
 Wait. 
 Here comes the jaquin, flying to its nest. 
 Why am I sucking my thumb? 
 And where are my pants? 
 It's a long story. 
 But right now, we have to get off this island before we vanish. 
 The boat is this way. Follow me. 
 Yes. I still have a little water left. 
 Esteban! Help me! 
 You saved my life. 
 It is the least I could do. 
 After you saved mine. 
 Elena, Esteban! 
 Come on! 
 Get in! 
 (Bones cracking) 
 Ay, my hip. 
 Mateo : That was close. 
 Esteban : This is true. 
 I wonder where the island is now. 
 I'll check the map. 
 Oh, I must've dropped it back there. 
 I guess I am old for good. 
 Personally, Esteban, I like you better this age. 
 Where is everyone? 
 All : Surprise! 
 Happy birthday! 
 I thought you forgot. 
 Of course we didn't forget. 
 Elena planned the whole thing. 
 Anything for my favorite cousin. 
 Ah, Elena, I am your only cousin. 
 Oh, don't be like that. 
 I know, deep down, you wuv me. 
 And now, Isabel will play a birthday song. 
 Uh, I can't do it. 
 Unless Abuelo joins me. 
 What? But I don't know how to play your way. 
 We won't play it my way or your way. 
 We'll play it our way. 
 Oh!

 If that's true, you should be a genius by now, chancellor. 
 (Growls) 
 Huh? 
 Tres leches! My favorite. 
 Well, make a wish. 
 Whoo-hoo! Happy birthday!
