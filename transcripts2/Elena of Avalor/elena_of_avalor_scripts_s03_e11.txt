 *ELENA OF AVALOR* Season 03 Episode 11 Episode Title: "DreamCatcher" 
 Previously, on "Elena of Avalor". 
 Whenever you feel a big emotion, big magic's going to happen. 
 You betrayed us. 
 No. But let me explain. 
 Your emotions are making all this happen, so the only way to stop it is to calm down. 
 What has happened to me? 
 You got the power of Takaina. 
 "Dreamcatcher." 
 The trick is to stay in control of the ball. 
 Whoa! 
 What? Noblins don't have tails. 
 Huh? 
 Wait! Come back! 
 Oh... 
 Where am I? 
 Whoa! 
 Hey, watch it. What? 
 We're growing here. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Mami's tiara? 
 Huh? 
 No! 
 You're going to break it. Give it back. 
 Hey, come back here. 
 Don't you dare do that again. 
 That's it! 
 Stop it. Now! 
 Aah! 
 Elena? 
 Isa? 
 You slept through breakfast. 
 I did? Huh. 
 Oh, I just had the weirdest dream. 
 And then there was this magical tree. 
 Wait, was this before or after the talking flowers? 
 After. 
 Ooh, hey, that looks amazing. 
 Is that a weird thing to say about a sketch of myself? 
 No. 
 I've made one of everyone in the family. 
 Look, here's abuelo. 
 Aww. - Abuela. 
 Esteban. 
 Why did you sketch him? 
 Oh, I... 
 I made this before we knew that he... 
 Betrayed our family? 
 Led Shuriki to our parents and lied about it for over 40 years? 
 I'm sorry. Forget you even saw it. 
 No way. 
 What? 
 What are you doing? 
 Chasing the peabunny noblin. 
 But, Elena, there's no such thing. 
 Yeah, you're right. Of course there isn't. 
 I slept so badly last night I'm seeing things. 
 And there are some things I'd rather not see. 
 I've been thinking about Esteban a lot lately, and I was hoping we could talk... 
 Isa, I don't want to talk about him ever again. 
 Okay, okay. 
 I don't even want to hear his name. 
 Esteban! Focus! 
 Huh? 
 I give up! I give up! 
 Get up. 
 Is this how you plan to get us back into Takaína? 
 By cowering like a frightened child? 
 I have told you, I am a man of civility and manners. 
 I am not cut out for battle. 
 Ah, I see what is going on here. 
 You do not like your new life with us. 
 You wish you could return to the palace, surrounded by servants and feasts and manners. 
 I do miss my mustache comb. 
 There's only one thing waiting for you at the palace. 
 A princess who wants to banish you to a deserted island. 
 But I know how you can avoid that fate. 
 Master the gift that was given to you when you fell into the Crystal Forge. 
 And learn your magic. 
 Come in. 
 Oh, it's you. 
 I'm sorry about earlier. 
 I just don't understand why we can't talk about what happened. 
 I'll tell you why. 
 I'm afraid if I talk about him, I'll think of everything he did to our family and I'll get so upset, it'll set off my new magic in some terrible way. 
 And I can't risk that happening.

 Thank you, Isa. 
 Where'd that tree come from? 
 That's... that's the tree from my dream. 
 Is this a real ruby? 
 As real as the crowns and cake. 
 There's cake up there? 
 Maybe the peabunny noblin I saw earlier was real too. 
 But why? Why are my dreams coming to life? 
 And why is the cake so high up? 
 Zuzo! 
 Hiya, Princess. 
 Whoa. 
 Since when do jewels grow on trees? 
 They don't. 
 I dreamt about this tree last night. 
 And it just appeared out of thin air. 
 Never a dull moment being your spirit guide, nope. 
 That's not all. 
 I also dreamt about a peabunny noblin, and now he's hopping around the palace somewhere. 
 Hm. So your dreams are magically coming true? 
 So good. Elena, can you dream about tamales tonight? 
 Oh, I also dreamt about this really annoying toucan-squirrel creature who stole my mother's tiara. 
 What if he becomes real next? 
 I need to know why this is happening and how to make it stop. 
 In all my centuries of spirit guiding, I've never seen anything like this. 
 It's so exciting. 
 Not to me. 
 Oh, right, right. 
 Okay, how about I tag along on your next dream, take a lookie-loo, and see if we can get to the bottom of this. 
 You can go into my dreams? 
 I'm a spirit fox. I can go anywhere. 
 Now go ahead and take a little siesta, and I will see you in dreamland. 
 Maybe if you weren't staring? 
 Oh, sure. 
 This might be easier if I hadn't just woken up a few hours ago. 
 Fair point. 
 Sleepy time help is on the way. 
 ♪ Let your eyes close ♪ 
 ♪ Breath through your nose ♪ 
 ♪ Not through your toes... ♪ Or your... elbows. 
 You are getting sleepy. 
 So very tired. 
 You can barely keep your eyes... 
 Zuzo! 
 Ah, well, that was refreshing. 
 Oh. 
 "And that was how the very first spirit guide got his stripes. 
 Chapter 263..." 
 I knew I could do it. 
 Time to find out what princesses dream of. 
 You made it. 
 And so glad I did. 
 You really know how to dream. 
 That's him! 
 The annoying creature I told you about. 
 He still has my mom's tiara. 
 What does it matter? It's just a dream. 
 It's my mom's tiara. 
 Aah! What...? 
 Zuzo. The ground. 
 Help! Remember, Elena, it's your dream. 
 So dream something up. 
 Ha! Let's get him. 
 Huh? 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 Whoa! Whoa! 
 I love this dream! 
 Whee! 
 Where'd he go? 
 Aah! 
 Hey, knock it off! 
 
 
 
 Quit it. 
 No need to get so mad. 
 I'm not mad! 
 Your dress says otherwise. 
 Huh? 
 Ah-ha! Aah! Zuzo. 
 Did your dress light up like that in your last dream? 
 Yeah. 
 It's that squirrel-bird creature. 
 He's infuriating. 
 Mm-hm. 
 I know why your dreams are coming to life. 
 Why? Well, we already know that if you feel big emotions when you're awake, it triggers your new magic. 
 So if I feel big emotions in my dreams... 
 Your new magic kicks in then too. 
 That means something from the dream I just had is going to show up in real life? 
 Yup. But maybe it'll be that nifty rainbow slide? 
 That does not sound like a rainbow. 
 Nyah, nyah! 
 Aah! 
 How do I stop this from happening, Zuzo? 
 A wise chanul once told me that dreams are the mind's way of working out problems we have in real life. 
 I don't have a problem with squirrels or toucans. 
 No, but you have a problem with something you're not dealing with while you're awake. 
 Your dream is trying to tell you what that is. 
 If you figure out why that creature's bothering you in your dream, you might figure out what's bothering you in real life. 
 And then you'll stop getting angry... 
 And my dreams will stop coming true. 
 Well, hopefully just the ones you don't want. 
 I better get napping. 
 Let's see. Chapter 264... 
 You fell asleep before the best part. 
 Shh! We have to catch him and get my mother's tiara back. 
 That's what's bothering me. 
 Hm? 
 Ugh! I wish I had my scepter. 
 Oh! Great. 
 Aah! Huh? 
 It's a dream. Just roll with it. 
 Right, right, okay. 
 Um, solaz... 
 Oh, come on! 
 Oh, I can roll with it... like an olaball. 
 Got you. 
 No! 
 Why'd you do that? 
 You ruined everything. 
 You? 
 Ah! 
 Did you see what happened? 
 Yeah. Your dream creature turned into Esteban. 
 It all makes sense now. 
 Can you please not say his name? 
 Okay, but hear me out. 
 Maybe your dream isn't about what a flying squirrel does to your mother's tiara. 
 It's about what your cousin did to your parents. 
 That's what you're really upset about. 
 Of course I am. 
 But I don't want to talk about that. 
 I know. 
 But keeping your emotions to yourself isn't making them go away. 
 They're just showing up in your dreams. 
 Hey! Stop! 
 Isa? 
 No! Give it back! 
 Leave her alone! 
 When I get down there... 
 I think "there" is coming up here. 
 Elena! Don't worry. I'm coming. 
 What's happening? 
 My dreams keep coming true, and it's all his fault. 
 Whose? Esteban. 
 Huh? 
 Esteban? Esteban? 
 Your magic must have brought him here. 
 It's really him? 
 Elena? 
 I am... 
 I am home? 
 This is not your home anymore. 
 Elena, your dress! 
 Whoa! Whoa! 
 Isa! 
 There's only one way to stop all this. 
 You have to let your feelings out. 
 I can't do that. My magic will go haywire. 
 It already is. 
 Bottling up your emotions only caused them to come out in your dreams and create this mess. 
 If you let your emotions out, you can let them go. 
 You're right. 
 I have to tell him how I feel. 
 Esteban. 
 Elena, I will do anything to make things right between us. 
 I will tell you where to find Ash and Zopilote. 
 Please, please just... Just listen. 
 No, it's time for you to listen. 
 What you did to our family, to our kingdom, it makes me feel furious. 
 And hurt. 
 And disappointed. 
 And I miss you, and I'm angry at myself for missing you. 
 But more than anything, I am just so, so sad. 
 I wish I could take back everything. 
 I wish you could too. 
 But you can't. 
 I'm sorry, prima. 
 Prima? 
 As far as I'm concerned, you are no longer familia. 
 Elena? 
 Everything's okay now. 
 I promise. 
 I have a feeling you'll sleep well tonight. 
 Where were you? 
 It does not matter anymore. 
 All you need to know is... 
 I am ready to put the past behind me. 
 Let us train, shall we? 
 There's my book. 
 Oh, I'll take out the page that has... 
 Esteban? No, that's okay. 
 And you can say his name. I can too now. 
 I Just have to share my feelings instead of keeping them inside. 
 That way they won't trigger my new magic. 
 Whew. 
 Although, I will kind of miss that cake tree. 
 I'm sure we'll find plenty of cake in the kitchen. 
 But first, I think it's time we had a good sister-to-sister chat about Esteban.
