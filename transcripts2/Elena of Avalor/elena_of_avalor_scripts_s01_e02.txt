 We really have a lot to do today, princess. 
 Your Majesty, pink or purple? 
 Love the purple. 
 Is everyone ready for the meeting, Armando? 
 What meeting? 
 Roses or tulips? 
 Both. The Grand Council meeting we have every morning. 
 Oh, that's every morning? 
 Starting today. 
 I should probably add that to my schedule. 
 Where's my... Oh! Thank you. 
 That reminds me. 
 I need you to sign this very important proclamation for the royal visit tomorrow. 
 Okay (tapping sound) 
 What's that racket? 
 My little sister. 
 (giggles) How's it going, Isabel? 
 I just finished. 
 Finished what? 
 My latest invention. 
 The presto changer. 
 It puts your clothes on for you. 
 Think of how much time everyone would save. 
 Oh, I'll never have mismatched socks again. 
 Isabel's entering it in the Invention Fair today. 
 Inventors from all over the kingdom are presenting their latest creations. 
 And Elena's gonna be my helper. 
 Ooh, let's test it out. 
 Get ready. 
 No! 
 The flower's supposed to go in your hair. 
 Well, the point of a test run is to work out the kinks. 
 Now you know the kink. 
 True. 
 What if something else goes wrong? 
 I'll be right by your side to help fix it. 
 I promise. 
 Thanks, Elena. 
 Morning, everyone. Sorry I'm a little late. 
 I was with Isabel... 
 The Grand Council meeting is called to order. 
 Esteban, the crown princess is supposed to do that. 
 Of course. 
 What was I thinking? 
 The Grand Council will now come to order. 
 Thank you. (clears throat) 
 So, big week. As everyone knows, King Toshi is visiting us from the kingdom of Satu. 
 How are the preparations coming? 
 The royal chef will be serving an Avaloran feast. 
 But since this is a special occasion, I am making the tamales myself. 
 And I have prepared a special song. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 This is King Toshi's first visit to Avalor, and we must show him that we understand his ways. 
 We must prepare Satu food. 
 We must play Satu music. 
 But if this is his first time in Avalor, wouldn't he be interested in how we do things here? 
 No. I have been to the kingdom of Satu many times, and I know it better than anyone. 
 What will impress King Toshi most is doing things the Satu way. 
 But what about my tamales? 
 Oh, they won't go to waste. 
 If Esteban is right, we cannot afford to offend King Toshi. 
 And I am sure Elena wants her first royal visit as crown princess to go well. 
 I do. 
 All right, let's put it to a vote. 
 All in favor of doing everything the Satu way, raise your hand. 
 Hmm! 
 Great. Now since you're the expert, Esteban, you can teach us the Satu ways. 
 Oh, you do not have to worry about that. 
 I will handle everything. 
 But if the point is to do things their way, we should all know them. 
 (stammering) Um, yes, but I am incredibly busy. 
 Actually, you're free all afternoon, chancellor Thank you, Higgins. 
 Perfect. 
 (groans) 
 Oh, meeting adjourned. 
 These are the gowns worn in Satu. 
 Ooh, pretty. I'll take that one. 
 Now we will learn to eat using chopsticks, like they do in Satu. 
 (laughing) Do not worry if you cannot do it right away. 
 It took me years to... 
 Naomi : Hey! 
 I think I got it. 
 (frustrated groan) 
 Elena? 
 Keep practicing. 
 You still have a few hours before King Toshi arrives. 
 He's coming today?! 
 Today? But what about the Invention Fair? 
 Oh, Isabel, don't worry. 
 I'm still going with you. 
 Elena, I know you want to help your sister, but it is your royal duty to host King Toshi. 
 Wait. Isabel. 
 I thought King Toshi was coming tomorrow. 
 Oh, he left a day early. 
 I thought I told you. 
 You did not tell any of us. 
 Well, he's not here yet. 
 So I'll just go down to the Invention Fair, help Isa set up, and be back before he arrives. 
 I don't know, Elena. 
 Do you have enough time? 
 Oh, she has plenty of time. 
 King Toshi's not expected until this afternoon. 
 Great. I'll be back before you know it. 
 I better run home and let my father know I'm meeting a king later. 
 This is turning out better than I'd hoped, Higgins. 
 What is, chancellor? 
 I wanted Elena to be unprepared for King Toshi's visit, so I could show off my expertise. 
 But now, she might not even be here at all. 
 So that's why you didn't tell them King Toshi was coming today. 
 You catch on quickly, Higgins. 
 Thank you. 
 Once King Toshi sees how well I know his ways, he will entrust me to make the trade agreement, and it will be clear to everyone who is the real power behind the throne. 
 Uh, Princess Elena? 
 Me! 
 And I have a special surprise for King Toshi that will close the deal. 
 Ooh, what is it? Tell me, tell me! 
 You will see soon enough, Higgins. 
 (evil chuckle) 
 All right, let's pack up and get going. 
 But I thought you didn't have time to help me.

 I'll grab a cart for... the thing. 
 Thanks, Gabe. 
 Elena, this is for you. 
 I made you a necklace out of spare parts. 
 Oh, I love it. 
 Thanks for always being here for me. 
 (horse whinnies) 
 King Toshi. 
 He's here. 
 I found a cart. 
 Cart. Great. 
 Let's get this thing inside and set up. 
 There's no need to rush. We have plenty of time. 
 Not really. 
 This is her spot. 
 What? Oh. 
 My invention! 
 I'm sorry, Isa. 
 Is it... 
 It's okay. I can fix it. 
 I just need my twist hook. 
 I must've left it back at the palace. 
 The palace? No problem. I'll get it. 
 No need. I'll grab it and be back before you know it. 
 Oh, no, no, no. It would be way easier for me to find it. 
 I know exactly where it is. 
 It's blue, right? 
 Red. 
 With a flat handle. 
 Round. 
 On it! 
 We're not gonna make it. 
 Race you to the palace, princesa. 
 Skyler! Yes. 
 I have a better idea. 
 How about you give me a lift, and we race that coach? 
 You got it. There's no time to stop. 
 On the count of three, jump. 
 One... 
 I said on three. 
 I don't have time for two or three. Let's go! 
 
 
 
 Hold on! 
 King Toshi. 
 King Toshi is here! 
 Already? 
 Where is Elena? 
 Not to worry. 
 I will greet King Toshi on her behalf. 
 Uh, mallet, screwdriver, no idea what this is. 
 Twist hook! 
 Ah, King... 
 Toshi. 
 On behalf of my kingdom, welcome to Avalor. 
 We are honored to be here, Princess Elena. 
 This is Soji, my royal advisor. 
 Please accept this gift on behalf of my kingdom. 
 A fan made from the finest silk in Satu. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 This is my grandmother Luisa, and my grandfather Francisco. 
 And you already know my cousin Esteban. 
 Chancellor Esteban. 
 Oh, and is that something for King Toshi in your hand? 
 This? Yes. It's a twist hook. 
 Made from the finest iron in Avalor. 
 Ah. I have never seen anything like it. 
 Much like the architecture of this palace. 
 Oh, would you like a tour? 
 My grandparents can lead you on one. 
 They know all about its history. 
 Let me hang onto this for you so you don't have to carry it around. 
 You are the crown princess, Elena. 
 You should lead the tour. 
 Oh, yes. Of course. 
 Right this way. 
 If I move a bolt over here, and another one over there, the piece should snap back into place. 
 No, it's stuck. 
 I really need that twist hook. 
 You know, when the drawbridge gets stuck, we have a trick to get it moving again. 
 Hey! 
 Ow! 
 Wow. It actually may have worked. 
 Let's try testing it out. 
 Do you mind? 
 Not at all. 
 Uh, was it supposed to do that? 
 There must be something else that's still broken. 
 What is taking Elena so long? 
 She should be back by now. 
 And here's the parlor, the music room, drawing room, sitting room, which is the perfect place to sit and take a nap. 
 You must be exhausted from your journey. 
 Thank you, but I am not tired at all. 
 Now, Elena, there are no siestas in Satu. 
 I have planned a full afternoon of festivities, a lovely Satu feast, followed by a concert of Satu music. 
 And last but not least, a special surprise a special surprise I know you will love. 
 So let us begin, shall we? 
 Coming, Elena? 
 (sighs) Right behind you, cousin. 
 Hey, Armando, sorry I'm late. 
 Oh, hi, Naom... 
 Naomi? 
 I need your help. 
 There's no way this is gonna work. 
 Of course it will. 
 All you have to do is sit at the table and pretend to be me. 
 I'll give this twist hook to Isabel and be right back. 
 Are you sure no one will recognize me? 
 Not with the hood over your hair, and this fan covering your face. 
 But I can't see anything. 
 Perfect. That means they won't be able to see you. You better hurry. 
 Is Elena coming? 
 Whoa... oh! 
 Oh, Elena. 
 Oh, good. You're here. 
 We can begin. 
 Where is Naomi? 
 We cannot wait any longer. (snaps fingers) 
 A Satu feast with all your favorite dishes. 
 Princess Elena, why don't you show King Toshi your chopsticks skills. 
 Impressive. 
 But this morning... 
 My granddaughter is a fast learner. 
 Hmm. 
 I'm here. 
 What took you so long? 
 And why did you change? 
 Uh, wardrobe malfunction. I got your twist hook. 
 I already fixed that part, but the cogs are out of alignment. 
 I have to move 50 different bolts to get them back. 
 Make that 51. 
 Is there anything I can do to help? 
 I wish there was, but I have to do it myself. 
 Great! 
 I mean, okay. 
 If that's what you want. 
 I'll just be right back. 
 Where are you going now? 
 Um, to get a drink. Want one? 
 No. 
 I'll take an horchata. 
 One horchata, coming up. 
 (fly buzzing) 
 Ow! 
 Psst. Naomi. 
 (coughing) Excuse me. 
 So what'd I miss? 
 Me, almost getting caught. 
 Do you know how hard it is to use chopsticks with a fan covering your face? 
 But you made it look so easy, Naomi. 
 Abuela. 
 You went back to the Invention Fair, didn't you? 
 Yes. I'm sorry. 
 Mija, this is your first royal visit. 
 I know, I know. 
 But Isa's having trouble with her invention. 
 She is? 
 I need to be there for her. 
 All right, go. 
 I'll cover for you. 
 But no more of this silly swapping. 
 Just hurry back before your cousin's big surprise. 
 I will. Thank you. 
 Elena will be right back. 
 But look who's here. Naomi. 
 Hey, Your Majesty. 
 Be right back. 
 Take your time. 
 No! It should be working. 
 It's okay. I'm sure we can fix it. 
 What just happened? 
 Where have you been? 
 And where's my horchata? 
 Hey, you weren't wearing those slippers before. 
 You went back to the palace. 
 That's where you've been going. 
 Yes. A king is visiting, Isa. 
 I want to be here with you, but I have to be there for King Toshi, and our kingdom. 
 You said you would always make time for me. 
 I know, I know. But today... 
 You have more important things to do. 
 No, I... 
 It's okay. 
 I can fix the machine myself. 
 Isabel. 
 Just go, Elena. 
 I'm sorry, Isa. 
 Oh, hi. You're just in time for Esteban's big surprise. 
 King Toshi, to show our honor and respect, I have learned to perform the most cherished and difficult Satu dance. 
 The Dance of the Fluttering Fans. 
 Esteban is dancing? 
 Well, I definitely didn't see that coming. 
 Just tell me when it's over. 
 I can't. I'm not looking either. 
 We can make him stop. 
 No, no. I promised the chancellor he could show me his surprise. 
 And in Satu, it is very important to keep your promises. 
 No matter how painful they are to watch. 
 You're right, King Toshi. 
 Promises are important in Avalor, too. 
 I think we'd make great trade allies, and I'm really sorry to do this, but I made a promise to help my sister at the Invention Fair, and I must put my family first. 
 I hope you understand. 
 (whispering) 
 Thank you for hosting us, but we must go. 
 Ay, no. This is a diplomatic catastrophe! 
 Elena is clearly not ready for the responsibility that comes with the crown. 
 King Toshi, wait! 
 All right, two more inventors, and then you're up. 
 What are you doing? 
 Packing up. 
 You can't quit. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Keeping my promise. 
 What about your big royal visit? 
 No royal duty will ever be as important as you. 
 Now let's get this thing fixed. 
 There's no way I can fix the machine in time. 
 Maybe you can't, but I know we can. 
 All we need is a little sister time. 
 So where do we start? 
 Well, I need the pliers. 
 The pincher thingy. 
 Got 'em. 
 Squiggly bolt. 
 Silver flat doughnut thingy. 
 Six-sided pinky ring. 
 Oh! This is why the cogs keep coming loose. 
 The chain is broken, and I don't have another one. 
 Okay, don't panic. We can figure this out. 
 We just need to get creative. 
 Hey, what about my necklace? 
 It kinda looks like a chain. 
 You're right! It's the right length. 
 But I don't know if it's strong enough. 
 There's only one way to find out. 
 Here comes the judge. 
 Are you ready to present your invention? 
 She sure is. Let's do this. 
 Hmm. 
 (machine whirring and squeaking) 
 Princess Elena. 
 King Toshi! 
 Please allow me to explain, Your Excellency. 
 Family is first in Satu as well, which is why I always travel with my brother. 
 So you're not upset I left? 
 Not at all. 
 I already know what Satu is like. 
 The purpose of my trip is to experience the sights and sounds of Avalor. 
 But what has really impressed me is how you value your family as much as your kingdom. 
 This is exactly what I look for in an ally. 
 Then you'll be our new trade partner? 
 I would be honored. 
 Oh, I'm so proud of you. 
 Oh, is that my twist hook? 
 (nervous giggle) 
 What a marvelous invention. 
 (chuckling) 
 Please enjoy the tamales my dear Luisa has prepared for you. 
 Thank you. 
 You open it like a present, and then, dig in. 
 Oh, my. This is delicious. 
 And now I will play one of my favorite Avaloran songs. 
 Chancellor Esteban, when in Avalor, perhaps you should do it the Avaloran way. 
 Thank you, Elena. You were really there for me today. 
 That's what sisters do.
