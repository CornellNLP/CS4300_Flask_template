 *ELENA OF AVALOR* Season 03 Episode 13 Episode Title: "King Skylar" 
 Previously on, "Elena of Avalor"... 
 Grotto Metamo is real? That's right. 
 And you're about to find out firsthand how it works. 
 Step one, name a creature. 
 Step two, put your victim in the magic roots. 
 Step three, victim changes into said creature forever. 
 Oops. Butterfrog. 
 "King Skylar" 
 Hey, that's me! 
 Oh, that was some royal summit. 
 You said it, Princesa. 
 Can't wait to get back to the palace and relax. 
 Skylar! 
 King Verago ordered you to come back to Vallestrella right now. 
 Whoo, big bro's in trouble. 
 You don't know that. 
 If it's an order, he's probably right. 
 I'll drop you off at the palace first. 
 No time for that. 
 Now means now. 
 Then I'm going too. 
 No way I'd miss watching Skylar get in trouble. 
 Hi, Dad. 
 Sky... ah... ah... ah... 
 Whew! Whew! 
 I brought you here today... 
 ...because I have taken ill. 
 So I'm not in trouble? 
 No. Whew! That's great news. 
 Uh, Skylar? 
 Your father just said he's not feeling well. 
 Oh! Right. How can I help? 
 You name it, I'm there for you. 
 I need you to serve as acting king until I am better. 
 Skylar? Him? 
 He must be delirious. 
 Me? Yes, you. 
 Until I am well enough to return to my duties. 
 Are you sure about this, Father? 
 Or is that just the cold talking? 
 What about Nico? Oh, he's love... 
 Too young. Or one of the king's guards. 
 Skylar... What about Tornado? 
 Cousin Eddie? 
 Or pretty much anyone. 
 The king has spoken! 
 Besides, all you have to do today is put the king's guards through their noontime drills. 
 I don't know, Father. 
 Skylar, you are the eldest prince, which means one day, you will be king. 
 This is your duty. 
 So get out there and take charge. 
 Take charge. 
 You got it. 
 Wait till I tell everyone. 
 This'll be good for Skylar. 
 Like a practice run. 
 Personally, I think he's going to do great. 
 Oh, really? 
 Then why is our King of the Jaquins acting like the King of the Chickens? 
 Skylar? What's the matter? 
 I can't go out there. 
 Why not? I've messed up so many times. 
 Mm-hm. In so many ways. 
 I'm just not good enough to be king. 
 And every jaquin out there knows it. 
 Skylar, as one ruler to another, I'm here to tell you you've got what it takes. 
 All you've got to do is what King Verago told you: get out there and take charge.

 All right, let the ruling begin. 
 Come on. It'll be so much fun. 
 Sorry, Nico. 
 You know skyball is not allowed in the palace. 
 But Dad's not making the rules today. 
 You are. 
 I guess so, but I... 
 What's the harm in a little skyball anyway? 
 You'll be everyone's favorite king. 
 Please! 
 Whoa! Look out. 
 Little late for that. 
 Rayo! 
 Yeah! 
 Yes! 
 Whoo-hoo! Yeah! 
 Jinx. Flappy. Everything good? 
 Never better. 
 Listen, we were hoping we could take a break from drills today and go check out Agua Dulce Pond. 
 Huh? 
 Isn't that off-limits? 
 We just want to take a peek. 
 We won't cause any trouble. 
 I wouldn't go breaking your dad's rules. 
 That'd be disrespectful. 
 True. True. Yup. 
 But you already let us play skyball in the palace, and that worked out great. 
 Verago put you in charge, Skylar. 
 You know, if you ask me, it would be disrespectful to not make your own decisions. 
 Huh? Huh? 
 Also true. 
 Okay, you can go. 
 But your father said you have to do guard drills at noon. 
 Oh, right. 
 Sorry, you have to stay. 
 But we've been drilling every single day for a month. 
 A day off would be really great for morale. 
 And you do want your jaquins to be happy, right? 
 I do... 
 So I proclaim you may take the day off to visit the pond. 
 Oh, who's the best king ever? 
 Ooh, I think his name is Skylar. 
 All right, you heard him, guards. 
 No drills. 
 And we're going to Agua Dulce Pond. 
 Ow! Yes! Nice work. 
 Skylar, come with us. 
 Okay. 
 Don't you think somebody ought to stay and watch the palace? 
 Great idea. Thanks for stepping in, princesa. 
 I'll be back soon. 
 I meant you. 
 Oh. 
 Right. 
 Ha! Best king ever. 
 Peace and quiet. 
 Huh? Huh? Huh? 
 Jaquins? 
 Oh, you got to be kidding me. 
 Aah! 
 You're blocking my sun! 
 Oh, it's beautiful. 
 Why would they keep this place off-limits? 
 Maybe something terrible's lurking under the surface? 
 Then we should definitely check it out. What? No, wait. 
 The only thing lurking down here is awesomeness. 
 Cannonball! 
 Aah! 
 That's it! 
 You're going to pay for this, jaquins. 
 I hate to admit it, but indoor skyball is fun. 
 Wings up. 
 King's guard! 
 Oh. Hi, Tornado. 
 Princess. 
 Luna, I expect my guards to be squared up and ready for drills at high noon. 
 So where is everyone? 
 They... took the day off. 
 What? 
 Whose bright idea was that? 
 His. 
 Oh, hey, Tornado. 
 The king is not going to be happy about this. 
 Actually, I feel really good about it. 
 Verago's sick, so he made Skylar king. 
 And I decided to give the king's guard a day off. 
 You're welcome. 
 Mm. 
 The king's guard doesn't take days off. 
 Ever! 
 Oh. I didn't know... 
 Just give the order and I'll line them up for drills. 
 But they're all out at Agua Dulce Pond. 
 Agua Dulce Pond? 
 That's way off-limits. 
 Why is it off-limits, exactly? 
 I wouldn't know, princess, because I've never been there. 
 And do you know why I've never been there? 
 Because it's off-limits! 
 We have to get them out of there now. 
 Okay. I've made up my mind... to do what Tornado said. 
 Come on, princesa. 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 Laugh now, fly boy. 
 Your sun-blocking days are about to come to an end. 
 Belly flop! 
 Butterfrog. Flaringo. Velociervo. 
 Is that a ten out of ten or what? 
 What happened to me? 
 You turned into a flaringo. 
 And you're a butterfrog. 
 Ha-ha! And I'm a velociervo. 
 Whoo! Look how fast I am. 
 Whoa. 
 Incoming! Nico, don't! 
 Peabunny. 
 What's going on? 
 Aah! Get it off, get it off! 
 Flaringo. 
 Velociervo. 
 What happened? 
 And let's make you a Butterfrog. 
 Where are all the jaquins? 
 Elena! 
 You have to fix this. 
 Nico? 
 Help. Skylar! Skylar! 
 Elena! 
 Skylar, help! Look at us! 
 The pond shape-shifted us. 
 Skylar, you're the king. Fix us. 
 Ah! What do I do? 
 We need to tell King Verago. 
 No! He doesn't need to know. 
 I can handle it. 
 Right? Ahh! 
 Absolutely. 
 Good. 
 
 
 
 I can't wait to hear what you have in mind. 
 You could... investigate and figure out what's causing it. Okay. We'll do that. 
 Uh, how do we do that? 
 Search the area for clues. 
 Right. Search the area for clues. 
 Mm-hm. Let me know if you ever get one. 
 Burn. 
 What are we looking for? 
 Anything unusual. 
 Hey, what's that weird-looking purple vine? 
 Down there, under the water. 
 I think it's a tree root. 
 It looks familiar. 
 I've seen it before, but I can't remember where. 
 Let's follow it. 
 Wait a second. These caves look familiar too. 
 I know where we are. 
 Grotto Metamo. 
 A Grotto-ma-what-now? 
 It's... 
 A magical shape-shifting cave. A magical shape-shifting cave. 
 Wait. A shape-shifting cave? 
 It's where Troyo tried to turn Chief Zephyr into a butterfrog. 
 Stay back! 
 If the root touches you after someone says the name of a creature, you get turned into that creature. 
 So the roots spread out to Agua Dulce Pond. 
 And that's what's causing the problem. 
 But who's calling out the creature names? 
 It must be Troyo. 
 It wasn't me! 
 Troyo? 
 That can't be Troyo. He's a coyote. 
 Was a coyote. 
 Oh, he got turned into a butterfrog when he fell into the grotto. 
 Tripped. 
 I was tripped. 
 Is there a way to reverse the magic? 
 Only one, unfortunately. 
 Whoever shape-shifted you can change you back. 
 That cranky butterfrog. 
 Him? Where is he? 
 Last I saw, he was at Agua Dulce Pond. 
 He said if I ever came looking for him again, he'd turn me into a snurtle. 
 I used to be a lightning-fast coyote. 
 Being a butterfrog is bad enough. 
 Ugh! 
 Disgusting. 
 And strangely delicious. 
 Okay, we have to spread out and scour every inch of this pond until we find that butterfrog. 
 Skylar! 
 Father, I can explain. 
 Tornado told me what happened. 
 When I put you in charge, I thought you could lead. 
 But I was mistaken. 
 I'm sorry. But we figured out... 
 Step aside, son. I'll take over from here... 
 Ah... 
 Whoa! 
 Dad! 
 Skylar! 
 Dad's a butterfrog? 
 King Verago? 
 Skylar, we got to find that cranky butterfrog, pronto. 
 I know, but how? 
 You're the king... again. 
 You tell us. 
 I will. 
 Right after you tell me what to do. 
 Okay. 
 Here's what to do. 
 Take charge. 
 This is bad! 
 Princesa, I told you I'm not cut out for this. 
 I know you can do it. 
 Who spotted the magical shape-shifting root in the pond? 
 Me, I guess. 
 Who tracked the root to Grotto Metamo? 
 Also me. 
 And who got Troyo to reveal how to reverse the curse? 
 You? 
 No. 
 Me? 
 You've been leading all this way without even meaning to. 
 Now it's time to take charge and not back down. 
 But what if they don't like my ideas? 
 What if they don't like me? 
 That's one of the hardest parts of being a leader. 
 You have to make what you think is the best decision, not the most popular one. 
 All right. Princesa, tell me everything you remember about the cranky butterfrog. 
 Well, it sounds silly, but he really hates it if you block his sun. 
 Can your scepter still make things grow? 
 Sure can. 
 I've got a plan. 
 We'll cut off his sunlight and flush him out that way. 
 Are you nuts? You can't turn off the sun. 
 What? Terrible idea. 
 I'm going to be eating carrots for the rest of my life. 
 We're doomed. In all my years as King of the Jaquins, I have never heard such a ridiculous, harebrained... 
 The king has spoken. 
 Okay, Skylar. Tell us what to do. 
 Tornado, we'll need your snaptraps. 
 It's a good thing I never leave home without them. 
 You and Luna each take one and be ready when we flush him out. 
 The rest of you, I need absolute silence or this will never work. 
 You got it! Shh! 
 Big bro. 
 Let's go catch a cranky butterfrog. 
 Light it up, princesa. 
 Bloom. 
 What happened to my sun? 
 There he is. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Aah! 
 Huh? 
 Hey! 
 Yes! We got him! 
 It's not fair. 
 I came here because it's the one place that's supposed to be off-limits to everyone. 
 And I still can't get any peace and sunshine. 
 That's the least of your problems now. 
 Uh, Dad? 
 I got this. 
 Luna. 
 As acting king, I'll make you a deal. 
 You reverse the shape-shifting spell, and this pond is yours. 
 A sunny patch to call your own. 
 What do you say? 
 Fine. 
 Just let me out of this thing. 
 As soon as you hold up your end of the deal. 
 Jaquin. 
 Jaquin! 
 Jaquin. 
 Do I have to change back? 
 Jaquin. Jaquin. 
 Aww. 
 Rats. 
 Stop laughing, bro. 
 Aww, but you're just so cute. 
 Look at you. 
 Jaquin. 
 Jaquin. 
 Whew! That's more like it. 
 Coyote. 
 Troyo? Snurtle! Snurtle? 
 Snurtle? 
 No! 
 No! 
 Jaquin. Jaquin. 
 Let's get you home, Dad. 
 Son, I've got bad news and good news. 
 What's the bad news? 
 My cold got worse from being in that pond. 
 And the good news? 
 Until I recover... 
 ..I know who I can trust to serve as king. 
 So do I. 
 Me. 
 He does mean me, right? 
 Yes, I mean you, Skylar. 
 Now get out there and take charge. 
 It would be my honor. 
 Wings up!
