 *ELENA OF AVALOR* Season 03 Episode 02 Episode Title: "To Save a Sunbird" 
 Previously, on Elena of Avalor. 
 Can you fix it? Other sunbirds might be able. 
 I'll take the scepter and leave it with them. 
 This is a map to Takaína. 
 Solve the puzzle, and the magic of Takaína will be yours. 
 New plan. We're going to Takaína. 
 You said we'd rescue Papá as soon as we got tamboritas. 
 That was before I had this map. 
 "To Save a Sunbird." 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 Elena, wait up! 
 Sorry, Mateo, but I'm done waiting. 
 I'm finally getting my scepter back. 
 That's right. So try to keep up, Migs. 
 To the Sunbird Sanctum. 
 Thank you so much for repairing my scepter. 
 We were not scaring your jester. 
 No, repairing her scepter. 
 You know, the shiny thing we worked on for weeks? 
 The sanctum has leaks? 
 Ah, forget it. 
 It works. 
 Bet that brightened your day. 
 Hey, where's Hool? 
 I want to thank her too. 
 Hmm. 
 Qapa? Lama? What is it? 
 I know it looks bad, but believe me, it's actually much, much worse. 
 What happened? 
 She, uh, used too much of her magic fixing your scepter. 
 Now Hool's life force is fading away. 
 All because she helped me? 
 It takes great magic to restore great magic. 
 What's going to happen to her? 
 As her life force fades away, so will she. 
 Princess. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I didn't know this would happen. 
 Me neither. 
 I'm only 500 years old. 
 I was sure I had at least another 200 ahead of me. 
 Oh, Hool. 
 There must be something we can do to help heal her. 
 Zuzo. Zuzo! 
 Hiya, Princess. 
 Oh, whoa. 
 Looks like it's almost time for her to take that one-way trip to the spirit world. 
 That's why I called you. 
 Is there something we can do to save her? 
 There she goes talking to her invisible friend again. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, there is one place you can take her that would restore her life force. 
 The Pool of Aziluna, in Avalor. 
 Of course. 
 We need to take her to the Healing Waters that freed me from the amulet. 
 Did you hear that, Hool? You're going to be okay. 
 That's wonder... 
 Is she...? ful news. 
 Oh, she just nodded off. 
 Come on. Get up. 
 You need to fly to Aziluna. 
 That was a long trip. 
 Now what? If she can't fly, how is she going to get to Aziluna? 
 Well, there is one thing. 
 You want me to sing? 
 Momentito. Momentito. 
 No, I said one thing. 
 We're trying to help her, not hurt her. 
 Oh, must have been a moth. 
 Ugh. Come on, Lama. 
 Okay, if the Crystal Caverns are here and the Mooncliff is here, then Tepet Muul should go over here. 
 You're welcome. 
 I don't recall Avalor having an ocean running through a mountain. 
 Do you, dear? Huh? 
 Ugh! 
 This map is impossible to solve. 
 Once you fix one side, the other sides don't make sense. 
 Carla. Darling. 
 Did you really think a map to indescribable power would be easy? 
 I miss Papá. 
 Let's go to Avalor palace and rescue him, and then figure out that map. 
 Patience, child. 
 Solving this map will lead us to Takaína, the crystal forge where Maruvians crafted all their magical objects. 
 Once we get there, all that magic will become ours. 
 And then we will rescue your father with ease. 
 I guess you're right. 
 Always. 
 And I just figured out the map. 
 Huh? 
 It looks exactly like Avalor. 
 Look, this red jewel is bigger than the others. 
 And it's right next to an engraved jaquin, an animal revered by the ancient Maruvians. 
 The jewel must mark the spot where we'll find... 
 Taka-whatever! 
 Takaína. 
 Here they come. 
 You brought her a flower? 
 It's a vidaflor. 
 Its seeds will make Hool young again. 
 Whoa! Whoa! 
 I can't remember the last time I felt so great, or spun this fast, or did whatever this is. 
 Oh! 
 I forgot my feathers were ever this... 
 Hmm. I guess Hool always had a napping problem. 
 Shiny! 
 You did it. You saved her. 
 Not quite. 
 That was our last vidaflor, and its effect only lasts a few hours. 
 Whoa! 
 Then she'll be back to where she was. 
 Unless you can get her to Aziluna first. 
 It's not far. 
 We can definitely get her there before the vidaflor magic runs out. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 Hool can get a little... 
 Hey, check out my tail! 
 Distracted. 
 Good point. We'd better leave now. 
 Come here, you. 
 Here we are. 
 Ugh! It's just an empty field. 
 Where's Takaína? 
 Maybe it's underground. 
 Boqato! 
 Boqato! 
 Boqato! 
 Boqato! Boqato! 
 Boqato! 
 Boqato. 
 Boqato. Bo... 
 Well, we can safely say Takaína is not here. 
 I-I was sure I solved the map. 
 One of these other jewels must mark the spot for Takaína. 
 There are dozens of jewels. Do we have to check them all? 
 Ugh! We're no closer to getting all that magic, and even further from helping Papá. 
 Carla... 
 If we had rescued him first, he could've helped us figure out this map. 
 Your father couldn't help us figure out a grocery list! 
 Mamá. 
 I'm sorry, mija. 
 I didn't mean that. 
 Look, we're both tired and hungry. 
 We're not thinking straight. 
 I'll collect some firewood, cook a nice meal, then we'll get back on track. 
 Well, I'm getting back on track now. 
 Whoa! 
 So this is Avalor? 
 Whoa, is that a butterfrog without any wings? 
 Yup. In Avalor, they're just "frogs." 
 Fascinating. 
 I don't even miss the butter. 
 There are three things I've always wanted to do in Avalor: see Tepet Muul, hug a churro, and eat a Noblin. 
 Come again? I mean, eat a churro and hug a Noblin, oops. 
 I promise we'll do all three after Aziluna. 
 Or we can squeeze Tepet Muul in right now. 
 Tepet Muul is in the opposite direction. 
 It is? Thanks! 
 Way to go, Mateo. 
 Wait! The vidaflor won't last long!

 Okay, stay focused and we'll be at Aziluna in no time. 
 Huh? 
 Stay focused. 
 On what? Ooh! What's that up ahead? 
 Pueblo de Oro. 
 That's where the Noblins live. 
 Noblins? 
 Way to go, Skylar. 
 Oh, we have to get her back on track. 
 Hey, there, Señor Noblin. 
 You are even cuter than I dreamed. 
 Ooh, I could just gobble you up. 
 Bring it in. 
 Aah! What? 
 No! 
 Jiku, that was our friend. 
 Why did you use your Golden Touch? 
 Yeah. She just wanted to hug you. 
 Hug me? I thought she was going to eat me. 
 So did I. Well, can you turn her back? 
 We just turn things into gold, not the other way around. 
 Oh, where'd this come from? This is the best slide ever. 
 Please be gentle. I can make un-gilding potion, but we'll need to go back to my workshop. 
 Then we'd better hurry. We'll be back. 
 Can you keep an eye on Hool? 
 I don't think she's going anywhere. 
 Whee! 
 Yay! Whoo-hoo! 
 
 
 
 I can't fail Hool. Not after what she did for me. 
 Don't worry, you won't. 
 Halt! Wait, don't I know you? 
 Carla Delgado? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Stealing your uniform. 
 Huh? Macaquentia. 
 Huh? 
 I demand you put down your... Cochimoc! 
 Ooh, that ground looks comfy. 
 Voilà. 
 One un-gilding potion, complete. 
 Yes! There's still time to save Hool. 
 Split up! She couldn't have gotten far! 
 Check every corridor! 
 Who's on tower detail? 
 I'm not sure where she went, but... 
 What's going on? And where are your pants? 
 Carla Delgado stole my uniform. 
 She's here? In the palace? 
 Reveal. 
 She's heading toward the dungeon. 
 She must be trying to free Victor. 
 We have to stop her. 
 But we need to get back to Hool. 
 Time is running out. 
 Ugh! We can't risk Carla and Victor getting away. 
 We'll just have to move fast. 
 Halt! Stop! 
 Cochimoc. In the name of Ava... 
 Sleep tight. 
 I'm coming, Papá. 
 Wait! 
 I don't remember inviting you for a visit. 
 Got you, you uniform stealer. 
 Let me go! 
 You want to get into our dungeon that badly? 
 Higgins will show you the way. 
 Yes, sir, Your Highness. 
 You'll pay for this! 
 Let's get back to Hool. 
 My turn! This is fun! 
 Noblins. Am I right? 
 Whee! 
 Jiku? 
 Oh. 
 Huh? 
 Aww, Noblins. Bring it in. 
 Nope. Nope. 
 We're going to Aziluna now. 
 Of course. Definitely. 
 Unless we see a place to get a churro. 
 No detours, and definitely no churros. 
 Come on. 
 We're running out of time. 
 Whoa, this place is so gorgeous. 
 And it comes with a pool? 
 You know, we should've come here first. 
 Zuzo! Zuzo! 
 Great, you guys made it. 
 Took a little longer than I expected. 
 What do we do now? 
 Right, so she's got to dive into the pool, swim way, way down, till she finds the Statue of Aziluna, then touch foreheads with it to release the Breath of Life. 
 That'll cure all her ills. 
 Got it. 
 Hool, you ready for a swim? 
 I sure am... Whoa! 
 Hool! 
 What's happening? 
 Oh, Princess. 
 The vidaflor's effect wore off. 
 Do you think you can swim? 
 Let's see. 
 Nope. 
 She's fading away. 
 If I hadn't stopped to get Carla, we could have saved you. 
 Don't blame yourself. It was my fault. 
 We took so long to get here. 
 You've been a great friend. 
 I can't let this happen. 
 I have to do something. 
 You've already done all you can. 
 Have I? 
 Elena! Princesa! 
 What are you doing? 
 If Hool can't swim to the Breath of Life, I'll bring it to her. 
 But I think it's a long way down there. 
 He's right. 
 A big, healthy sunbird could easily make it to the statue, but I'm not sure a human could hold their breath long enough. 
 You can't go. It's too risky. 
 The kingdom needs you. 
 We need you. 
 What kind of ruler would I be if I didn't sacrifice everything for a friend who sacrificed everything for me? 
 But... 
 Okay. 
 Come on, Elena. 
 Hmm? 
 I've got you. 
 Thanks. 
 Get it close to Hool so she can breathe it in. 
 I'm... 
 You're okay. 
 I'm more than okay. I'm... 
 Alive! 
 Whew. 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 I failed you, Papá. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You came back. 
 That's all that matters. 
 And besides, your mother seems to have evaded capture, so she'll come to save us any time now. 
 Right? 
 Well... 
 "I'll be back after I save Papá." 
 Foolish child. 
 Now I'll have to rescue you as well. 
 But first things first. 
 Hool! You're okay! 
 We knew you'd be back. 
 Well, we hoped. 
 It's all thanks to the princess. 
 She risked her life for me. 
 Who cares about your sore knee? 
 How was Avalor? 
 Amazing. 
 Did you get to eat a churro? 
 That was the only thing I didn't get to do. 
 What's that amazing smell? 
 Churros, direct from Avalor. 
 Special order from the princesa. 
 Aw. Oh, thank you. 
 I've been dreaming about this moment for 500 years. 
 Ugh! Did she just go to sleep again? 
 Just kidding. 
 Oh, Hool.
