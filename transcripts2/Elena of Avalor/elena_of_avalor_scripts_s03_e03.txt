 *ELENA OF AVALOR* Season 03 Episode 03 Episode Title: "Father-in-Chief" 
 "Father-in-Chief." 
 Ready to review tomorrow's schedule, sir? 
 I certainly am. 
 Uh, Chief Zephyr? 
 Okay, now, about tomorrow. Everything is in order. 
 Once the Guardians assemble at Commander's Rock, the ascendance ceremony will commence, then you can announce the new... 
 Dawn. 
 Actually it's sunset, sir... All my years as chief, I have flown these skies and watched over Avalor. 
 Much like the sun. 
 But every sun that rises must also set. 
 It is time for me to usher in a new dawn. 
 Now if only I could decide who will become our next chief. 
 He could be right under your snout. 
 The new chief will be responsible for all the jaquins in Avalor. 
 So it's not a decision I take lightly. 
 Of course, sir. 
 I eagerly await your choice. 
 Until then, I will ensure the ceremony goes perfectly. 
 With you in charge of it, I am certain that it will. 
 One more thing. 
 Do not make a big fuss over my retirement. 
 Tomorrow is not about the sun that's setting. 
 It is about the new sun rising. 
 Understood, sir. 
 Definitely no fuss. 
 The party is off. 
 The party is off! 
 The party is off! 
 It sounded like you said the party was off. 
 And I know you didn't say that, because I only came back to Avalor for the party. 
 Sorry, but I was just with the chief, and he insisted that no one make a big fuss. 
 Oh, whenever someone says they don't want a big fuss, they usually want a huge fuss. 
 And this one's going to be the fussiest. 
 But I gave him my word that there would be absolutely nothing fun or special about tomorrow's ceremony. 
 And if I don't do this right, Chief Zephyr might not choose me to be the next chief. 
 Migs, you've already proven yourself. 
 You have nothing to worry about. 
 I hope you're right, Princess. 
 New dawn. New chief. 
 Oh, please let it be me. 
 Incoming! 
 Attention! 
 That means line up. 
 Now then, Zoom. 
 What do I expect while I'm away at the ceremony? 
 For us to be obedient-ious. 
 Like future Guardians, right, Daddy? 
 Correct. And if you don't, I'll take you straight to the long, lost shape-shifting caves of Grotto Metamo and turn you all into stinkbats! 
 No! Stinkbats? 
 Give me a break, Pops. 
 Every jaquin knows that's just a fairy tale. 
 Fairy tale or not, I expect you all to behave for your mother. 
 You got it, Chief Daddy. 
 Whoa, I'm not chief yet. 
 Chief Zephyr could always name someone else. 
 No way! Uh-uh. 
 Impossum-i-ble.

 Dulce? 
 Dulce, are you all right? 
 Oh, yeah. Just a little... 
 Cold. 
 No big deal. 
 No big deal? You can barely stand. 
 I'm fine. 
 Today is your day, cariño, and you can't be late for the ascendance ceremony. 
 Now go on. 
 Are you sure? 
 Positive. 
 Anoki blast! 
 Mommy! Daddy! 
 Knock it off, Zoom. I mean, Estrella. 
 I mean... oh, you know who you are. 
 You know what? I'll take the kids with me. 
 Oh, thank you, Migsy. 
 Fanta-bulous. Commander's Rock, here we come. 
 Wings up, niños. 
 Good luck. 
 You're going to need it. 
 Where's Migs? 
 The ceremony's about to start. 
 Slow down! 
 Me first! Me first! No me! 
 Mingo? 
 Hey, Princess Elena. 
 Uh, Migs? What are the kids doing here? 
 Dulce is sick, so I had to bring them along with me. 
 But it'll be fine. I'm not worried. 
 Zoom, get off me. I'm gonna tell on you. 
 Stop it. 
 Not even a little worried? 
 Attention, Guardians. 
 Now what did we talk about? 
 That today is Daddy's special day. 
 And that we have to be super-duper respect-fulous. 
 That's right. I have lots of responsibilities, so I need you to be on your best behavior. 
 Aye-aye, Chief Pops. 
 Ahem! Aah! 
 I'm here. Sorry, sorry. 
 Guardians! 
 Hmm, very good. 
 Chin up. Wings back. Very good. 
 Yes, yes, stand proud. Very good. 
 Uh... I got them. 
 Thank you. 
 Princess Elena, you look funny. 
 Listen, you're still my future Guardians, right? 
 Posi-lutely. 
 Well, wouldn't now be a perfect time to show everyone? 
 You're right. Come on, let's show them. 
 Wait, where are you going? 
 Our turn. 
 Future Guardians, salute. 
 Sir, I-I can explain. I... 
 Well, then, now that we're all here, let us commence the ceremony. 
 Coyo mote tozaza. 
 Whoa! - Whoa! 
 What's gotten into you? 
 I'm bored. 
 I'm hungry. 
 I'm bored and hungry! 
 Hungry! 
 There. 
 Now please, stay put and stay quiet. 
 Can you do that for me? 
 Yes, Pops. Affir-mama-tive. 
 They're starting without me. 
 What's happening? 
 Every retiring chief gets a statue placed among the chiefs of the past. 
 Cool. 
 I can do it. Let go. 
 What are you doing? I told you to... 
 Mingo can't open his melon. 
 I can too. 
 Zoom tried to steal it from me. 
 Did not. 
 Mingo, let go this instant. 
 But I can do it. 
 No! 
 Oh! Oh! 
 Oh, no. 
 Sir, a thousand apologies. 
 Oh, I can wipe that right off. It's going to be fine. 
 I'll wash it off in the stream, and then continue the ceremony. 
 I hope. 
 Poor Migs. 
 Wouldn't want to be him right now. 
 What a disaster. 
 I'm a complete embarrassment to the Guardians. 
 It's just melon juice. 
 I'm sure Chief Zephyr will understand. 
 Eventually. 
 Maybe so, but he won't trust me to lead the jaquins if I can't even control my own children. 
 Now I'll never be chief. 
 Huh? 
 The sad, old chief is retiring, and I don't even get an invitation to the party? 
 Troyo? 
 Troyo? The future king of the jungle? 
 Aah! Where? 
 I'm his number one fan! 
 Oh, wait. I'm Troyo. 
 What are you doing back in Avalor? 
 We banished you. 
 Correction. 
 You tried to banish me. 
 But having a bunch of noblins strand me on a deserted island couldn't keep old Troyo away. 
 Oh, no. 
 What do you want? 
 I am so glad you asked. 
 See, during my cruel and unjust forced exile, I happened upon a little butterfrog. 
 Turns out he was once a majestic flaringo, until he stumbled into a shape-shifting cave in Vallestrella. 
 Grotto Metamo. 
 So I forced him to tell me exactly where it was. 
 Then I ate him. 
 Gamey things, butterfrogs. 
 So, are you planning to turn me into a butterfrog too? 
 Who's a smart widdle kitty? 
 You are. 
 No wonder you're the chief. 
 Sorry, ex-chief. 
 It's payback time. 
 Chief Zephyr? 
 Chief Zephyr? 
 Huh? 
 Where could he be? 
 Couldn't have gone far. 
 What's that? 
 Looks pec-luli-lar. 
 We should go tell Dad. 
 Pops! Daddy! 
 Papá! 
 There's a weird thing on the ground, over by the stream. 
 Daddy is busy right now. 
 Why don't you all run along and pick flowers. 
 But you got to see this, Pops. 
 Over here. 
 What is it, Princess? 
 Hey, that's the thing I found. 
 Troyo's back? 
 Is that the coyote you warned us about? 
 The one who took Ciela and Avión? 
 That's him, all right. 
 Troyo must have taken Chief Zephyr. 
 But why? 
 And where would he take him? 
 I don't know. But you guys search the area. 
 The rest of us will go to Pueblo de Oro. 
 Maybe the noblins have seen him. 
 Hop on, Princess. 
 Wings up, niños. 
 Mingo? Let's go! 
 But, Pops, wait. I found something. 
 Tell me about it later. 
 
 
 
 But I want to show you this. Enough. 
 You're in big trouble as it is. 
 I don't want to hear another peep from you until after we find Chief Zephyr. 
 Now move it. 
 Come on, Mingo. We got to catch up. 
 No. I found some tail prints. 
 They might lead to Chief Zephyr. 
 I'm going to save him so that Daddy can still be chief. 
 We'd better tell Papí. 
 You weigh a ton. 
 What do jaquins eat? 
 Coyotes. 
 Ha, ha, ha. 
 Coyotes. 
 So you're sure you haven't seen any hint of Troyo? 
 Nope, not even a howl. Sorry, Princess. 
 Okay. Thanks, Jiku. 
 Now what? I don't know. 
 But every second we sit on our tails is another second Troyo slips away. 
 Daddy, we have to go back. 
 Mingo found tail prints. 
 What are you talking about? Where's your brother? 
 Following the prints. 
 He thinks they'll lead him to Chief Zephyr. 
 Not to worry. 
 Pretty soon you won't be able to hurt a fly. 
 Or maybe only flies, you know, since you'll be a butterfrog and all. 
 Whoa-ho-ho! 
 This place is amazing. 
 Forget king of the jungle. 
 I want to be King of Vallestrella. 
 Those are Chief Zephyr's prints. 
 Then Mingo's headed right for Troyo. 
 What a beautiful day for revenge. 
 Hang on, Mingo. 
 Boom! Grotto Metamo. 
 I bet when you woke up today to retire as chief, you didn't realize you'd be retiring as a jaquin too. 
 Hey! 
 You're blocking my sun. 
 Can't speak, huh? Well, can you hear? 
 Because I said, you are blocking my sun! 
 You're lucky I don't care for the taste of butterfrog. 
 I don't care what you like to eat. 
 Get out of my sun. 
 Oh, like this? 
 Or how about this? 
 Better? 
 I won't forget this, furball. 
 Oh, the butterfrog's mad at me. 
 Whatever will I do? 
 Tsk, tsk, tsk. 
 Mingo. 
 Oh, time to go. 
 Hey, let me go. 
 Let go of our brother! 
 Yeah! 
 Mingo! Chief Zephyr! 
 Where'd they go? 
 There are too many tunnels. 
 They could be anywhere. I'll never find them. 
 I've lost Mingo, and it's all because of me. 
 When I try to be a good father, I fail at being a leader. 
 And when I try to be a good leader, I fail at being a father. 
 I know how hard it is to balance ruling and spending time with family. 
 But it is possible. 
 I know, because I've watched you do it. 
 You're a model of strength for the Guardians, and a model of love for your kids. 
 Really? 
 Papí, I found something. 
 Look. It's a trail of Anoki berries. 
 It must be Mingo. 
 Come on. 
 And here we are. 
 Grotto Metamo. 
 Grotto Metamo is real? 
 That's right, squirt. 
 And you're about to find out firsthand how it works. 
 Step one: name a creature. 
 Step two: put your victim in the magic roots. 
 Step three: victim changes into said creature forever. 
 Repeat as necessary. 
 You first, Chief Butterfrog. 
 Let them go, and I'll let you walk out of here unharmed. 
 Or throw them both into Grotto Metamo and get out of here anyway. 
 Yeah, I'll go with that. 
 Hey! 
 Aah! My eye! 
 Guess we'll have us a baby butterfrog instead. 
 Mingo, Anoki blast! 
 Oh! My other eye! 
 Oops. 
 Butterfrog. 
 I'm a butterfrog? 
 I told you I wouldn't forget, furball. 
 Are you okay, Chief Zephyr? 
 I am now, Princess. 
 Thank you all for the bravery you have shown. 
 Pops! 
 Come here, son. 
 Victor-ory! Yay! 
 We got him, Pops! 
 We sure did. 
 You didn't have to come. 
 Yes, I did. 
 I missed the kids. 
 And you too. 
 No, I mean, you really didn't have to. 
 I made a mess of the day. 
 This was not at all how I wanted my last day as chief to go. 
 Everything that could have gone wrong, did. 
 From beginning to end. 
 It was reckless, it was dangerous, and it could have destroyed our ascendance ceremony tradition. 
 I'm sorry, cariño. 
 Which is why I have chosen our next leader to be... 
 Chief Migs. 
 All hail Migs! That's my Migs! 
 Way to go, Migsy! - Way to go, Migsy! 
 But, sir, why? 
 As a father, you have learned how to juggle a million things at once with a combination of wisdom, kindness, and most of all... 
 Incoming! 
 Whoa! 
 Patience. 
 So, by my estimation, you were already a great leader. 
 Chief Migs! 
 Chief Daddy! Chief Daddy! 
 Chief Pops! 
 Surprise! 
 Migs, I said not to make a fuss. 
 Pardon me, sir, but my first order as newly appointed chief is to make a big fuss over you. 
 As you wish. 
 So how do you feel, Chief Migs? 
 Like I'm dreaming. 
 Anoki blast! 
 Yup. Dream's over. 
 Whoa!
