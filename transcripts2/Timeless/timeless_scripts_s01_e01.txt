Since he killed his wife and child and went off the grid. That was a year ago. We thought he was holed up in Chechnya, but apparently not. Why's he taking the Star Tours ride? [sonic pop] Wh... What the hell was that? Some sort of special effect? Ever heard of a closed timelike curve? You're Connor Mason. My buddy has one of your cars. I... excuse me, a closed timelike what? Right. Say, this, is the fabric of space-time. Now, if you get a powerful enough gravitational field, you could actually bend it back on itself, creating a kind of loop that would allow you to cross over to an earlier point. An... an earlier point in time, you mean? What he means is, Mr. Mason invented a time machine. And chose not to tell the government about it until it was stolen by terrorists. Right, 'cause the federal government never screws up anything and can always keep a secret. You're asking for our help now. Uh... wait, hold on. This is a joke, right? I mean, some... some psych test the government came up with? I mean this... This can't be possible, right? Well, that's what they said about the moon shot, until someone with enough imagination made it very possible. [metal clanks] [alarms blaring] Our earliest prototype. She isn't fancy, but she works, usually. Now, we kept her operational in case the crew of the mother ship ever needed a rescue. We call this one the "Lifeboat." Their CPUs are linked. But unfortunately she can't tell us exactly where the mother ship has gone. But she can tell us when. Naturally. Only tells you when. Time machine problems. Yes, we're working on it, but for the moment that's the best we have. 3:30 p.m. May 6, 1937. We found this on the dead shooter. It's an address, a tavern in Manchester, New Jersey. That's the "Hindenburg." About four hours before it crashed. You're telling me that this guy actually went back in time, for real, to the "Hindenburg"? Lucy, if Flynn kills people in '37 who aren't supposed to die, they don't have the kids they're supposed to have, do the things they're supposed to do, history changes. Reality changes. So why would you be stupid enough to invent something so dangerous? I didn't count on this happening. Why would Flynn do it? We don't know. But there's room in there for three passengers. Wait... to... to do what? Go after him? Why else would we bring you here? You're insane! I mean, even if I believed you, which I don't, I am not getting in that thing to... what? Go after some terrorist? I am not a soldier. We have a soldier. We need a historian. A good one who knows the customs, can travel incognito, help us keep a low profile. Great, I'll email you some names. I think someone who loved history would want to save it. Besides, what if I am telling the truth? Don't tell me you're not the least bit curious.

Apparently, this time machine works. So why don't we just go back five minutes before Flynn stormed in and then shoot him in the face? You can't go back to any time where you already exist, where you might meet a double of yourself. It is bad for the fabric of reality. Define "bad." We tried it once.

Come on, Professor, we gotta move. Tell us what we're getting into. Okay. [stirring music] The "Hindenburg" is just reaching the airfield, but she won't be able to land right away. [thunder rumbles] Because of that. Light rain and high winds. So she'll make a bunch of turns, causing the air friction, building up static electricity. Then, at exactly 7:25 p.m., the "Hindenburg" will throw down the mooring ropes,  but the ground crew will drag the ropes  through the grass... They get soaked. Which electrically grounds the ship,  causing a spark in the metal hull. The spark ignites a leaking hydrogen balloon, So why is Flynn here? Here you go. Thank you, miss. Thank you. Maybe he wants to kill all 97 people on board instead of just the 36? Make a bad thing worse? Whatever it is, we find him first, fast as we can. And if we do find him? Leave that to me.

He's gonna help bring down the "Hindenburg." [brooding music] We owe Kate another drink for that one. She is amazing. Who we talking about? Kate Drummond. She only has about 90 minutes to live.

And the anarchist group? Three suspects who escaped from jail and vanished without a trace? Yes? That was us. What? We had some issues. Flynn wanted a lot more than two casualties. He wanted to murder everyone onboard, and we stopped him, but the "Hindenburg," it wasn't supposed to happen like this. Flynn still changed history in... in ways I... [sighs] In what ways I... I don't know yet. Did you see him? I spoke to him. Really? What did he say? He said I should ask you why you chose me and what Rittenhouse means. I have no idea what he's talking about. I don't know. Rufus, where's Flynn now? Uh, the "Lifeboat's" CPU says that he's back in present day, but who knows where. And so we can't go back to '37? Give it another shot? No. Remember, we can't double-back to any place where we meet ourselves. There are no do-overs. So what is Flynn after? I have a theory. Any anti-government wack-job can get a few barrels of fertilizer and blow up a federal building. It's not going to really change anything.
