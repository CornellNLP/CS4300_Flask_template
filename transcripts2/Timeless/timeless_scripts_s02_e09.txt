 Previously on "Timeless..." 
 I'm going to die. What? 
 On one of our next trips. 
 Jiya saw it in a vision of hers. 
 Did you ever think that maybe you are seeing these things so that you can save Rufus? 
 Let's to see what Rittenhouse has been hiding. 
 That's Jessica. Who's that? 
 Kevin, my brother you shoot pool with all the time. 
 Not in my timeline. What do you mean? 
 He died before he was three. No, he didn't, Wyatt. 
 Is there something you're not telling me? 
 Yeah, there is. 
 I'm pregnant. 
 Colonel Ryerson, sir, you have a visitor. 
 It's a young woman? 
 All right, send her on in. 
 I brought you something from home. 
 So, uh, no letters or photos from my wife? 
 It's been a little chaotic since you left. 
 Come on, when's the last time you had a cheeseburger? 
 A nearby Union regiment is about to raid the plantations along the Combahee River. 
 You're going to stop them. 
 All the details you need are in here. 
 Pull this off, and you're back home with your wife and all the cheeseburgers you can eat. 
 It's this way. 
 Why did you bring me here? 
 To talk about Emma. 
 I realize you two have had your issues. 
 Please. I don't care about any of that. 
 And I don't care that you're sleeping together. 
 I don't trust her. 
 Why do you say that? 
 I think she's sabotaging the missions. 
 The Suffragette movement of 1919. 
 That should've been easy. 
 And yet somehow, the mission fails, and Emma is the only one to come back alive. 
 If you asked Emma, she'd say that Lucy is to blame. 
 You're my grandfather, and I have the greatest respect for you, but quit thinking with your crotch. 
 Excuse me? You're blind. 
 Emma's been a part of almost every one of these failed missions, but each time you blame Lucy? 
 The fact is, Rittenhouse is in Lucy's blood, not Emma's. 
 Rittenhouse is about family. 
 It's about legacy. 
 Something Emma will never understand. 
 My daughter. Yes. 
 My mother. 
 She was two when I left. 
 I never got to see her... grow up. 
 You sacrificed everything for Rittenhouse. 
 For her. 
 For me, one day. 
 Emma isn't family. 
 Her faith is fleeting. 
 She doesn't believe in you like I do. 
 You wanted to see us? 
 Wait, where's Flynn? I think he's still asleep. 
 You ever hear him snoring? Dude needs a CPAP. 
 No Flynn, just you three. 
 What we're about to tell you stays between us, for Wyatt's sake. 
 For my sake? 
 I found some, shall we say, troubling files on the Rittenhouse computers. 
 Is that Jessica? 
 When was that taken? 
 There are hundreds of these, going all the way back to Jessica's childhood. 
 Rittenhouse has been following Jessica her entire life? 
 Why would they do that? 
 That's what we've been trying to figure out for a week now. 
 You've known about this for a week? 
 You're just now telling me? Look. 
 I'm treading cautiously here. 
 But Rittenhouse brought Jessica back from the dead for a reason, Wyatt. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you saying Jessica works for Rittenhouse? 
 The truth is, we don't know who she is. 
 Yeah, we do, she's my wife. 
 I've known her since high school. 
 No, Wyatt, to be precise, you knew a Jessica who sadly passed away. 
 This Jessica could be different. 
 Do you have any reason at all to suspect Jessica of anything? 
 Come on. 
 This is insane. 
 If she were Rittenhouse, wouldn't she have tried to kill us by now or given up our location? 
 Exactly, thank you. 
 Wyatt, I'm moving her out of the bunker. 
 It's the safest thing for Jessica and for us. 
 Wait, wait, what? Wouldn't that put her in danger if she's not Rittenhouse? 
 We will provide her with around-the-clock protection. 
 Jessica's not going anywhere. 
 I know this isn't easy for you, but you're a soldier, and you need to think of the mission. 
 Jessica's a potential security risk. 
 She's pregnant. 
 You throw her out, I go too. 
 She's what? 
 I think he just said she's pregnant. 
 That went well. 
 South Carolina, June the 1st, 1863. 
 We're going back to the Civil War again. 
 Yay. 
 So why South Carolina? I don't know. 
 Fort Sumter was a couple of years before. 
 The assault on Fort Wagner isn't for another month. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 What about the Combahee River Raid? 
 Oh, um, of course. 
 It was that night. 
 Oh, come on, Lucy, defend your territory. 
 You're the history geek. 
 It was a regiment of mostly Black Union soldiers who planned a surprise attack on dozens of plantations in the middle of the night. 
 Torched fields. Freed hundreds of slaves. 
 If Rittenhouse stops it, it's a serious blow to the Union. 
 Attagirl, show 'em who's boss. 
 There's more. 
 It was led by Harriet Tubman. 
 You think Rittenhouse is trying to derail the Underground Railroad? No. 
 The Underground Railroad was humming for years before that. 
 During the war, Tubman was actually a Union spy. 
 They called her... They called her "The General." 
 How'd you know that? 
 Oh, well, she's not just an American hero. 
 Uh, across the pond we even have streets named after her. 
 So they are going after Tubman and her men. 
 Wyatt. 
 You have anything you'd like to add? 
 Why? 
 Obviously you all are the experts at everything. 
 Let's get going. 
 She better be here when I get back. 
 You have my word. 
 Sure you're gonna be okay while I'm gone? 
 I'm not the one I'm worried about. 
 Yes, I'll be fine. 
 Turns out pregnancy just makes me wanna binge-watch 
 "This Is Us" and ugly cry, so I'll get it all out of my system before you're back. 
 We gotta tell your family the good news soon. 
 Sure. 
 As soon as we get out this dank, rusty hellhole, I will send out the invitations for the baby shower. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 I know you wanna see 'em. 
 I wanna see 'em too. 
 Hell, I never even met your brother. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What? 
 It's just weird how much you've been talking about my brother lately. 
 Well, it's, uh... 
 It is kind of weird. 
 You know? 
 In my timeline, he died when he was three from leukemia, and now he's suddenly alive and kicking. 
 It's... So am I. 
 That's a good thing, right? Yes, of course. 
 Are you sure you don't remember how he was cured? 
 Or who cured him, or why, or anything? 
 I mean, it's just... I was a kid. 
 Would you rather he'd have died? 
 No, come on. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Now, are you going to answer my question? 
 The important one? 
 What question? 
 Boy or girl? 
 Ah, hmm... 
 Let's see. 
 I will take either one. 
 Girl. You can't say that. 
 Girl, 100%. What if it's a boy? 
 Then I will love him... almost as much as a girl. 
 And we'll just... we'll just try and try and try until we get one. 
 You are truly awful. 
 You are. 
 Be careful. 
 Yeah. 
 I don't think you should be angry at Christopher. 
 She's just trying to protect us. 
 Who's angry? 
 I'm just reading a map. 
 Look, I get how hard this Jessica thing must be, but we just have to keep an open mind. 
 Yeah, an open mind. 
 That my wife is a cult-loving, sociopathic traitor. 
 Rittenhouse took those photos for a reason. 
 They brought her back for a reason. 
 Yes, to distract us, in which case, Christopher freaking out is exactly what they want. 
 I hope so. We just... 
 We have to be sure. 
 What do you want me to say, Lucy? 
 That my wife is a liar? 
 Hell, maybe she's lying about being pregnant too. 
 You do think she's lying about that. 
 If Rittenhouse doesn't kill us, the mosquitoes will. 
 Is West Nile a thing yet? 
 No, but typhoid and dysentery killed about 150,000 soldiers. 
 So, better wash your vegetables. 
 What's up with Captain Sunshine? 
 This must be the 2nd South Carolina. 
 They were the only Union regiment in the area. 
 Tell me it's not the same regiment that's supposed to raid the plantation tonight. 
 Afraid so. 
 This wasn't supposed to happen. 
 Looks like the Confederates took them by surprise. 
 Rittenhouse must have a Sleeper in the Confederate Army telling them what to do. 
 So we're too late? 
 History's already changed? The South's gonna win? 
 Help. 
 Please. Help. 
 Please. Help me die. 
 Help me die easy. 
 We'll find a doctor for you. 
 No, no. 
 Please. Mercy. 
 Give me a gun and I'll do it myself. 
 What's wrong with you, not helping a soldier in need? 
 You're Harriet Tubman. 
 You're alive. 
 But you won't be for long. 
 Now, who the hell are you? 
 You don't know us, but we know you. 
 You are a legend where we're from. 
 Where's that? 
 Sound like Yankees. 
 General McClellan sent us to help you and Colonel Montgomery with the raid tonight. 
 I was just thinking you look familiar to me. 
 I seen you before? No. 
 We're from really, really far up north. 
 Well, you're late. 
 Damn Rebs came from out of nowhere. 
 Like they knew right where to go. 
 Colonel Montgomery retreated. 
 Took all of his men along with him. 
 Do you know where the Rebs are now? 
 No. 
 But I aim to find out and slit their throats before the night's out. You can't continue the raid. 
 Montgomery's gone, and so are most of your men. 
 Most, but not all. 
 Got some recuperating at a safe house nearby. 
 Wait, we are hunting a Confederate spy, the one who led the attack on you here. 
 If you would just give us a minute, let us do our job. 
 If you think I'm gonna stand down, you don't know me very well. 
 You wanna find your spy? 
 I'll let you join us. 
 But get in my way, I shoot you my damn self. 
 Dude. 
 Harriet Tubman's hardcore. 
 Yeah. 
 Where have you been? 
 I wanna meet Stanley Fisher. 
 I'm sorry, I don't know who that is. 
 You don't? Let me refresh your memory. 
 The time machine pilot you've had locked away in a mental hospital. Hmm? 
 The one who has had similar visions to mine. 
 The one that you've been hiding from me and Rufus. 
 I haven't been hiding anything. 
 Don't you dare. 
 What I've been going through, and you knew someone going through the same thing and you didn't tell me. Where did you get all this... 
 Oh, that's where you were. 
 Hacking into my laptop. 
 Take me to Stanley Fisher. Why? 
 "Why?" 
 Maybe because he can help me understand my visions. 
 And then I can help Rufus. 
 Look, he... 
 The reason I didn't tell you is 'cause I wanted to protect you. 
 You're not gonna learn anything about your visions from Stanley Fisher. The man's as mad as a hatter. 
 I don't need protection, I need answers. 
 You're gonna keep hounding me till my dying day, aren't you? 
 Without question. 
 All right. 
 I'll see if Agent Christopher will let us up for some air. 
 That went better than I thought. 
 All right now. 
 What's she giving him? 
 She knows all sorts of herbal remedies. 
 She was a nurse, a cook, a spy, a soldier. 
 She had to fight for a military pension. 
 Still didn't get it. Died in poverty. 
 But if she goes on this raid, she's gonna die a lot sooner than that. 
 This is Samuel. 
 Tell 'em what you told me. 
 I've seen the Rebs at the Willow Glen Plantation. 
 Ran here as fast as I could. 
 Brave kid. Willow Glen's just up river. 
 Whole lot of slaves there who could help us. 
 And a lot of Confederates who could kill you. 
 Start mustering. 
 You said you had men. I see a half-dozen here. Where's the rest? 
 We'll make over a hundred with the slaves we free. 
 They're unarmed, fighting soldiers with guns. 
 And I would give every drop of my blood to free them. 
 What're you fighting for if it ain't for this? 
 We're with you. We are. 
 But it's important that we find this Confederate spy or every battle that we fight from here on out will be a losing one. 
 All right. 
 I'll help you get to your spy, but then I'm freeing those slaves. 
 You hear me? We hear you. 
 Believe me, we are not gonna lose this freaking war. 
 We leave at dark. 
 To Colonel Ryerson, for his heroic defeat of those back shootin' Blue-bellies. 
 And for saving our grand plantations along the river. 
 Hear, hear. Gentlemen. 
 Gentlemen, there should be many more battles to come. 
 In fact, scouts tell me Union regiments are converging on Vicksburg. 
 We leave at dawn. 
 Face them on the road before they join forces. 
 Should be easy pickings. 
 Hear, hear. 
 Where'd you get that? 
 Harriet insists. 
 I tried to tell her I am covered, but... she's a little stubborn, in case you haven't noticed. 
 I noticed. 
 She's going in outnumbered three-to-one. 
 Well, we'll just have to get in and get out before things get too messy. 
 You mean before her and her men are all killed? 
 Hey, if you think you can talk her down, have at it. 
 Besides, we need her to show us the way. 
 I have a different idea. Yeah? What's that? 
 You and Rufus go with Harriet, and Flynn and I will ride to Port Royal to convince Colonel Montgomery to give her the troops that she needs for the raid. 
 You and Flynn? 
 Of course. 
 You and Rufus are a better team. 
 Yeah, I suppose we are. 
 And Harriet likes you. 
 Just delay her for a few hours till we get back with the troops. 
 Can you do that? I'll do my best. 
 I've got it, Wyatt. 
 I appreciate you trying, but Colonel Montgomery ain't coming back. 
 He has new orders. 
 He'll come back when I tell him what'll happen if he doesn't. Oh, yeah? 
 What's that? 
 That the Union will lose the war. 
 Confederate territory the entire way. 
 I can handle a couple of farmers playing soldier. 
 Just... be careful. 
 We'll come back with reinforcements. 
 Don't start the party without us. 
 It actually fits pretty well. 
 Thank you. Glad to help. 
 Lots of people 'round here siding with the devil. 
 Plenty of decent folk too. 
 I'd like some extra crispy chicken tenders, Colonel Sanders. 
 You're a riot. 
 So, I figured I'd go in with him, uh, as a freed man. 
 Boy, we're sneaking you in as a house slave. 
 We'll get you your clothes next. 
 Got it. Right. 
 So, Colonel, can you do an accent? 
 Nah. 
 How y'all doin'? 
 Okay, less J.R. from "Dallas," more Leo from "Django Unchained." 
 Wha... who? And what? 
 Uh, these guys from back home. 
 Boy, you do too much talkin'. 
 They'll find you out real fast. 
 She's right, drop the accent. 
 Leo was overacting anyway. I will keep it subtle. 
 Just make it quick. 
 As soon as we free our brothers and sisters, we're setting fire to those fields, whether or not your friends are back with Montgomery's reinforcements. 
 Can you just try to wait until we find the spy? 
 Ma'am. It's important. 
 This could actually win the war for the Union. 
 You ain't stopping me. 
 We'd be crazy to try, Ms. Tubman. 
 Now I realize why you look so familiar. 
 God came to me in a dream and told me you was coming. 
 Lord works in mysterious ways. 
 I'd introduce you, but as you can see, he's not very, um, sociable. 
 Is he always like this? 
 95% of the time. 
 His muscles have atrophied, even though he's perfectly capable of getting out of bed. 
 Well, at least, he was. 
 He's having a vision. 
 You're having visions too? 
 Stanley, this is Jiya. 
 Jiya, meet Stanley. 
 Still training pilots, I see. 
 Out of necessity, I'm afraid. 
 Tell me, Connor, have you ever wondered what it must've been like to know Genghis Khan, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler? 
 In my visions... 
 My visions... 
 I've seen the most evil men in history doing unimaginable things. 
 Yes, and your point being? 
 You're worse. Oh, right, there you go. 
 You hear that? Worse than Hitler. 
 Someone call "The Guinness Book of World Records" and tell them there's a new worst person ever. 
 How many mental trips have you taken? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 Have you seen any new colors yet? 
 New colors? 
 The forbidden colors. 
 Um, no, I... I don't think I have. 
 You will. 
 And you'll love them. 
 Are you ready? 
 Another day at the office. 
 So, you know we're friends, right? 
 Like, bro code and all that. I got your back. 
 Rufus, whatever you're gonna say, just say it. 
 It's about Jessica. 
 You seemed a little defensive. Stop. 
 Not another word. 
 Oh, like now... now? Totally not defensive. 
 She isn't Rittenhouse. 
 It's not true. 
 I hope you're right, I think you're right, but there is a lot at stake here. 
 We just gotta be sure. It can't be true. 
 'Cause if it is... 
 I'm done. 
 I lost her once, I just... 
 Can't lose her again. 
 I just can't. 
 I-I-I get it. 
 I'm just asking you to consider it. 
 If there is anything with her or her family that doesn't add up, just say something. 
 That's all. 
 How long you been free? 
 All my life. 
 You're lucky. 
 I know. 
 You said God told you we were coming, that he speaks to you in your dreams. 
 How long have you been having these visions? 
 Had 'em for years. 
 My spirit travels out of me when I'm in a spell, searching for His voice. 
 And when I hear it, He shows me the path, what I gotta do. 
 And God told you to go on this raid even with the odds against you? 
 There's two things I got a right to, and those are death or liberty. 
 One or the other I means to have. 
 You're not afraid? 
 You're a fool if you ain't. 
 But I'll stick my rifle right in fear's ugly face anyway. 
 Come on, now. 
 It's getting dark. 
 Time for us to go join your friend. 
 You come to me without official orders, no identification of any kind, one of you with an accent I can't quite place, and expect me to send my regiment back to where we narrowly escaped death after being ambushed by a Confederate cavalry unit? 
 Well, you don't have to be so glass-half-empty. 
 Who the hell are you people? 
 We are Union spies. With no papers? 
 Because we are spies. 
 Colonel Montgomery, sir, Harriet Tubman and her men are risking their lives for this raid. 
 My regiment's been ordered to Port Hudson first thing tomorrow. 
 You change that order, I'll change that plan, otherwise... 
 
 
 
 Harriet Tubman needs you. 
 And the Union needs her. 
 There are more than 750 slaves working on the river plantation who are willing to fight. 
 You are going to need those men at Fort Wagner, Vicksburg, and Petersburg. 
 Who are you, Miss, to speak to me this way? 
 I'm someone who knows what the hell she's talking about. 
 Take your hat, sir? 
 Oh, yeah. Thanks. 
 Damn the abolitionists. 
 Welcome. 
 I don't believe we've had the pleasure. 
 Rhett Butler. 
 Visiting from my plantation in Georgia. 
 Hey, Mama. I'm coming now. 
 Come on, baby. 
 Evening, Ms. Tubman. Evening, Ms. Tubman. 
 Nancy, go and tell the others it's time to go. 
 We going to the boats on the water? 
 No, we're walking to Port Royal. 
 Isaiah, this is my new friend, Rufus. 
 Come from up north to help us fight the Rebs. 
 What's going on in the house tonight? 
 Some kind of occasion, I don't know what for. 
 That's what Rufus is aiming to find out. 
 Can you sneak him in as a house slave? 
 He's gonna need some clothes. 
 You're just a tiny little thing, ain't you? 
 And now I'm back in junior high. 
 I'll get the children out safe and gather up the others. 
 We'll wait for your signal as long as we can. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 We're getting you out of here for good. 
 These were my brother's. 
 He was tiny like you. 
 Called him Chipmunk. Yeah, no, I get it. 
 We swept through that Yankee camp like a swarm of angry hornets, cutting down every man standing. 
 Even one man sitting. 
 Caught doing his business in the bush. 
 Now, how did you all know that that Union camp was even there? 
 Intelligence from one of our top men. 
 Colonel Ryerson. 
 Just seems to know things no one else knows. 
 Hmm. I'll bet. 
 I mean, I do declare. 
 Hmm. 
 Uh, gentlemen, if you all will excuse me. 
 So are your visions of the future, or, like, what's gonna happen in the past in the future? 
 If you know what I mean. I do. 
 You and I, we can time travel. 
 Without the machine. 
 Like Joan of Arc, Florence Nightingale, Kirk Cameron. 
 We've been given a gift from God. 
 They're scared of us. 
 That's why they have me here. 
 No, Stanley, you're here because you won't look after yourself. 
 At my expense, I might add. 
 Look, something bad is gonna happen to someone I care about, and I need to stop it. 
 But the vision comes in... pieces. 
 Because you're fighting it. 
 I once spent an entire week in 1912. 
 It's like a dream you don't wanna come out of. 
 You need to let your mind relax. 
 Let yourself go on the mental trip. 
 How do I do that? 
 Do you have access to a sensory deprivation tank? 
 Sure, let me just order one from SkyMall. 
 Um, no, I don't. 
 You need to find a very quiet place so you can focus on the vision. 
 Then, after a while... 
 You'll get better at... 
 At falling into them. 
 Like this. 
 All right, show's over. 
 No, no, no, no, no, I have more questions. 
 Now, he could be in this catatonic state for days. 
 This is why I didn't want you to see him. 
 You do not wanna end up like this. 
 Do you? 
 Come on. 
 I'm so sorry, old friend. 
 Hey, you. 
 Let me have one of those drinks. 
 That's the accent you're going with? 
 Why? What's wrong with that? 
 Nothing, if you're Keanu Reeves in "Devil's Advocate." 
 You watch way too many movies. 
 What'd you find out? 
 The Confederate officer in the other room, he had a sudden, and damn near magical knowledge where the Union camp was. 
 He's a Sleeper Agent. Right. 
 Is Harriet gonna wait for Flynn and Lucy to get back? 
 Well, she said she'd wait as long as she could. 
 We got runners! 
 Which is apparently not very long. 
 Awful late for a walk, ain't it? 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah. 
 You know what we do to runaways around here, don't you? 
 Age don't matter. 
 We gotta teach you all your place. 
 Wanna tell me my place again? 
 Come on. Let's get on, now. 
 Maybe it's Lucy with our backup? 
 Right. When have things ever, ever gone that well for us? 
 Wyatt? They're Union spies. 
 Down. Kill them. 
 You're outgunned, pal. 
 That's a Colt Army Model, 44-caliber, six-shot. 
 I got a Glock 9mm. 
 Three extra clips in my pocket. 
 I can do this all damn night. 
 But you, by my count, have one shot left. 
 All it takes is one. 
 I just want my bag. 
 You give it to me and she lives. 
 Hey, David Duke. Looking for this? 
 Just toss it to me. Sure, no problem. 
 Catch. 
 No! 
 Don't move. Don't move, or I'll shoot her. 
 Do not move, or she dies. 
 Ah! 
 I quit, by the way. 
 Word is, all them plantation folks up river are running off. 
 Lord, they scared of us now. 
 Truth be told, I'm a little scared too. 
 You are a total badass. 
 What'd you call me? 
 Uh, no, sorry. 
 That is a compliment where I'm from. 
 I still don't know where that is. 
 Not anywhere close. 
 When I saw you coming, during one of my spells, you were like angels, appearing out of nowhere, like you were sent straight from heaven. 
 These visions you have, do they always come true? 
 Not always. 
 Sometimes they make no sense at all. 
 Like, when you appeared out of nowhere, you were stepping out of a giant metal ball. 
 Go figure that one out. 
 Well, I gotta go. 
 My friends, the other Union spies, we have to check in with our commanding officer. 
 Can I just tell you what an honor it is to have met you. 
 I wish I had some advice for you, about how to make money, something to make your life better, because if there is anyone who deserves it, it's you. 
 My only desire is to live free. 
 The rest will work itself out. 
 Looks like the Combahee River Raid is now the Willow Glen Plantation Raid. 
 A decisive one for the Union, led by Harriet Tubman. 
 Hmm. 
 I'm gonna go check on Jessica. 
 Oh, uh, congratulations, by the way. 
 Lucy gave me the news. 
 You're gonna be a great father. 
 Hey. 
 So you told Flynn. 
 It was a long ride to Port Royal. 
 I mean, he was gonna find out sooner or later, wasn't he? 
 Yeah. Uh, whatever. 
 Okay. 
 Fine. 
 We're good. 
 Great. 
 Should I be hearing something? 
 Maybe a little indigestion. 
 I had the weirdest interaction with Agent Christopher today. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, I told her I was pregnant, and then she said that I should leave for the health of the baby. 
 You believe that? 
 She wasn't supposed to talk about that until I got back. 
 You knew? 
 She told you about this? 
 Well, what did you say? 
 I said if you go, I go. 
 Good. 
 Jess. 
 But look, maybe... 
 Maybe she has a point. 
 What? Why? 
 There's gonna be doctors' appointments, and... and Lamaze classes, right? 
 And I want things to be normal for you. 
 And for our baby. But you won't be there. 
 I will be. As often as I can. 
 I'll check in all the time. 
 You're the one who said it's not safe for me out there. 
 No, we'll keep security on you, 24/7. 
 You're hiding something from me. 
 No, that's not true. It's me, Wyatt. 
 I know when you're hiding something. 
 You've spent our entire marriage hiding things from me, and I told you I cannot be married to a state secret. 
 Please, please do not do this. 
 I'm not keeping anything from you. 
 I swear. 
 Hey. 
 I'm headed to bed. Long day. 
 Cool, yeah, I... I'm just, uh, running a systems check to see if everything's okay. 
 Is everything okay? With you? 
 Long day worrying about you dying in the Civil War. 
 I worry about you too. 
 You know, Harriet Tubman had visions. 
 She told me she saw us coming. 
 Seemed to see the Lifeboat too. 
 Swore up and down it was coming from a higher power. 
 God. 
 Do you believe her? 
 I'm not ready to go all Pentecostal or anything, but maybe something was sending her and you these visions for a reason, maybe we... 
 I need to pay more attention. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, like if I can find a way to see more of the vision, then maybe we can find a way to stop it. 
 Exactly. 
 If we can't run from it, we'll run right into it. 
 Sounds like a plan. 
 Don't stay up too late. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Jiya. 
 Jiya, what're you doing? 
 Stop. Don't come any closer. 
 Jessica? 
 What're you doing? What's going on here? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Jessica!
