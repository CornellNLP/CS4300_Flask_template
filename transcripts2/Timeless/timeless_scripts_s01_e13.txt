 Previously on "Timeless"... 
 I know a lot about you, Emma. You faked your own death, and hid in the past. You have no idea what you're up against. I have a pretty good idea. No, you don't. I know things that Anthony doesn't know. Things that they have planned for that machine. You're helping Garcia Flynn? What does he have on you? I've given up everything for this. This isn't easy for me. Jessica died. It was my fault. That's all I can think about. I'm so sorry.  You help me. I'll give you the name of your wife's killer. The guy you're looking for... is currently serving for two other murders in San Quentin,  and his name is Wes Gillian. What're you gonna do about it? I want you to help me steal the time machine to save Jess. Will you help me save my wife? [loud knocking] [tense music] Hi. Is everything okay? Nice place. Look, I'm sorry, I know it's so late, but I need to tell you something, and I'm only telling you because I trust you. Okay. I'm going to get Jessica back. What? Me and Rufus. Tonight. We're stealing the Lifeboat. [laughs] Do you have any idea how much trouble you are going to get into? I mean, this... that's insane! That's an understatement. Okay, let me get dressed. Lucy, no, no, no... Lucy. I'm not dragging you into this. If you think for one second that I'm letting you go without me... You have a deal with Agent Christopher to get your sister back, if you come, that's out the window. You know that. But... does it have to be tonight? I don't have a deal. The minute we actually stop Flynn, they're never letting me near that machine again. What if Flynn takes out the Mothership again while you're gone? Then the Lifeboat's CPU will tell us, we'll come right back. What if you get into a sticky history situation and can't history yourself out of it, what are you gonna do without me? I've done my research. What if someone gets hurt? I'm gonna go back and make sure the killer's parent's never meet. That way, he's never born. Nobody's getting hurt. Lucy, Jessica's killer murdered two other women. My hope is to save all three. [sentimental music] What about Rufus? I got him covered. What about you? Best case scenario, you get kicked off the team. Yeah, well, whatever happens, it'll be worth it to have Jessica back. ♪ ♪ [cries] ♪ ♪ Are you okay? What do you need me to do? I need you to call Agent Christopher. Tell her everything. Just give me a 20 minute head start, that way, you'll be covered, you won't get in trouble. Why does this feel like we're saying goodbye? ♪ ♪ Good luck, Wyatt. Thank you, ma'am. ♪ ♪ Pretty sure, but there's no way they're gonna believe I'm your hostage. Plausible deniability is all we need, my friend. March 1983's cutting it kind of close. I was born December of that year. What kind of clothes did you pick out for me? I don't know, something shiny. If there are parachute pants in that bag, so help me God... Rufus, minute tops, before this place is swarming with Homeland Security. You promise you're not gonna hurt anyone? Yes. Okay. Thank you. All right, look good for the cameras. [exciting music] ♪ ♪ And that's Rittenhouse's dirty little secret. Least as far as I know. Hey, you wanted to hear it. Feel better? Oh, God, that's good. I missed beer. So you actually think Rittenhouse can do all that with the Mothership? That's why they bankrolled it in the first place. Soon as I found out, sent me running to the 1800s. And you didn't know about it? I had notions. But not this. This is an existential threat to reality. [tense music] We should destroy the machine. Not the worst idea. Oh, come on. Even if we destroy the Mothership, someone still needs to smash the Lifeboat. Rufus will do it. If we told him, you know, the fate of the world is at stake. I think he might. And what's to stop Mason or Rittenhouse from just building another one? Takes three or four years to build one. Buys us a little time. No. We stick to the plan. We wipe Rittenhouse from history. Look, you want to save your family, I get it. But if the Mothership falls into Rittenhouse's hands, it's too dangerous. Like I said, we stick to the plan. Are we clear? Anthony. [airplane engines whooshing] [indistinct chatter] Do you see her? No. I don't know. ♪ My only sunshine ♪ 
♪ You make me happy ♪ What're you doing? "The A-Team." Season one, episode 13, "The Beast from a Belly of a Boeing" airing live. You know, we're kind of like the A-Team. Through time. Time Team. Okay, we're looking for Claire Gilliam and Joel Bender. The killer's parents. Claire's a flight attendant from Cleveland, big Indians fan. She has a layover tonight here in Toledo where she has a one night stand with a bartender, Joel. Classy. The 9:00 A.M. tomorrow, she's got a flight to Milwaukee, never sees him again. And you know all this, how? Her son was a serial killer. There's tons of interviews, articles with him. I've done my homework. Look, all we gotta do... is make sure these two don't hook up tonight. So it's like a reverse "Back to the Future"? Got it. Okay. She should be deplaning... now. ♪ ♪ It landed early. It says the plane arrived 20 minutes ago. We missed her. Wait, you didn't know that? No, Rufus, I didn't know that. Come on. [clears throat] Excuse me. Hi, uh, do any of you happen to know Claire Gilliam? She's a flight attendant. Uh, stewardess. They're called stewardesses. I'm an old friend from high school. We're supposed to be meeting up. You just missed her. Oh, no, where'd she go? Hopped in a cab to the hotel, I think. Yeah, I'm supposed to be meeting her there. It's the, uh, the Red Roof Inn... The Toledo Express Inn. Toledo Express Inn. That's right. Great. Thank you. Welcome. He's cute. What the hell was Wyatt thinking? I get you're upset... Upset doesn't touch how pissed I am. I'm fielding calls from the President, for God's sake. And Rufus was a hostage? My ass. He was in on it, and so were you, by the way. The minute that Wyatt told me what he was doing, I called you. 24 minutes after he left, actually. So you're spying on me now? I put a car on your house for your protection, you're welcome. This is about Wyatt's wife, isn't it? I knew he was fixated on her murder, but this is just so reckless. Can you blame him? I mean how is he supposed to let Jessica go when, thanks to you, everyday, he has to come to work and stare at a damn machine that can go back in time and bring his wife back to life? I thought we were a team... he should've just come to me. Oh, the way that I came to you about Amy? You and I had a deal. While I chased Flynn through time, you would be working on getting me my sister back, and how is that going so far? It is not that simple. You have done nothing! I am not surprised that Wyatt stole the Lifeboat behind your back... I am shocked that he didn't do it sooner. I would steal it myself if I thought it would bring Amy back. And you would do the same for your family. [thunder rumbling] [Tommy Tutone's "867-5309/Jenny" playing] ♪ Jenny, Jenny, who can I turn to ♪ 
♪ ♪

So the people we're supposed to keep from meeting just met. [telephone rings] Yeah?  I need to speak to Rufus. [tense music] Anthony? Get Rufus now. Um... Hey, you all right? Who is it? He's not available. Well, make him available. I'm not sure how to respond to that. Jiya, who's on the phone? Anthony Bruhl's on the line. He says he'll only talk to Lucy. That's ridiculous, I'm gonna speak to him. No, you won't. What... why? Why me? I don't know, but he asked for you, just keep him talking. No, no, no, no... that's... I... Hello? This is Lucy Preston. Where is he? Rufus took out the Lifeboat, didn't he? That's got to be the only reason he's not picking up his half dozen devices. Why would Rufus want to talk to you after everything that you've done to help Flynn? Yeah. Right. So you and me... we'll have to speak, instead. Face to face. There's a park, 16th and Mariposa. Downtown, one hour. What? So you're here? You're... you're in San Francisco? Come alone. Leave your phone. No technology. I'll know if you're wired. I don't understand. Why me? Besides Rufus, you're the only one that'll understand. Understand what? Give me one good reason why I should trust you. Because I have a plan to end all of this. For good. [dramatic music] [The Human League's "(Keep Feeling) Fascination" playing] Two rum and Cokes, one with a lemon. Thank you. ♪ ♪ Uh! Hey. Sorry. Ma'am. Thank you. Did you just call me "ma'am"? Hey, bartender! I'm sorry, ma'am, that's just a force of habit. From what? Well, look, in the Special Forces, they teach you to be polite. Uh-huh. Yeah, right. No, no, no. It's a true story...

No, not really. ♪ ♪ "Manimal"! What? The... the show. It's, uh, hard to find, where I'm from. Oh, my God, I love "Manimal." I mean, I love "A-Team," but still. Yeah, that's because "The A-Team is the best show in the history of ever, yeah. Best show ever! [both chuckling] What? For most girls, oh, I don't know, "Flashdance" or "Staying Alive" is their thing, but most guys think that I'm a weirdo. You are. ♪ ♪ I am, too. Hey, do you guys want to get out of here and go to a club or something? Oh, actually, I'm waiting for a friend to arrive, so... I can't... Special bulletin here, folks, tornado watch currently in effect for Lucas, Fulton, and Wood counties. We've got storm clouds moving east all along this area with gale-force winds as high as 65... That does not sound good. Ah, they always make it seem worse than it is. [groaning] Oh, my God. What happened, are you okay? There's a tree down in the road. I couldn't see anything... I slammed right into it. Here, sit, sit. Were you wearing your seat belt? No, I'm not nine years old. Here, I'm a stewardess, I know first aid. Is there a first aid kit? Right here. Ugh. Hey, I can help with that. I got it. They were closing the highway. Pretty much every road in the area, so I am sorry to say, folks, but you're all stuck here. Well, it can't be that bad. Let's go. I'm not going anywhere. Okay, it's cool. [tense music] Yeah. Thank you. Well, I think I should accompany Lucy to meet Bruhl. He and I have worked together for over a decade. We're mates. He trusts me. Yet he didn't ask for you. Which is precisely why I think it's a trap. Thank you, I'll take that under advisement. Okay, can we just be serious for a minute? What if Flynn grabs her again, jumps into the Mothership? We can't very well chase her with a Lifeboat gone, now can we? It's a risk. There's a chance that Bruhl means what he said. If he has a way to end all of this, we can't ignore it. We have to try. I... I have to try. I'll take the risk. We need to get going if we're going to make it in time. Jiya. If there really is a tornado out there... what if it hits the Lifeboat? It's safe in the barn. Right, because barns never blow away in storms? Would you look at these two? I mean, seriously, what are the odds? Just try and take it easy. "Take it easy"? My wife's life hangs in the balance of these two idiots over there flirting. All right, Logan, if we can escape the Alamo, then we damn sure can ball block Rick Springfield over there. [thunder rumbling] [chuckles] It's 12 hours until Claire leaves for Milwaukee, all right? I'll stay on Joel, I'll never leave his side. Let's split up. I'll take Claire. Rufus, he cannot go to her room. Right, 'cause if he does, they'll bang and conceive a serial killer, got it. That is not a sentence you say every day. [The Human League's "Don't You Want Me Baby" playing] Uh, bartender? Can I have a... banana daiquiri? Uh, I got to get the blender. It's a whole thing.

♪ Don't you want to ♪ No, I'm very concerned about drug abuse. Especially among the young. Did you put anything on the windows? The duct tape's in the drawer. All right, well, be careful. Love ya. Everything okay? Yeah, my sister is getting worried. It's getting pretty bad out there. Sorry to hear. Thanks. Hey. Hey. Becky. So, crazy being stuck here. Makes you wonder what we're gonna do... to pass time. You could play Galaga. That's one idea. Um, I'm gonna go put on some music. Dude. Go talk to her. Oh, um... she kind of scares me.

Anthony... either you trust me or you don't. I... I get that you and Flynn are trying to wipe out Rittenhouse... We're no better than Rittenhouse. I know. I'm just a cog in Flynn's machine, I get it. I do. But I can't do it anymore. [sighs] Not with what Rittenhouse plans to do. Thank you. Okay, look... Rittenhouse tries to control everything. But truth is, it's a struggle. They've always fought against outliers, rebels. JFK, MLK. And these days, they lose more control every year. But what if they could change it? Change what? Change history? Go back. In the Mothership. Attack key moments in time, til they get what they want, a reality in their image. Shiny, happy, brave New World. Sterile, clean... and totally under their thumb. Are you telling me that... Rittenhouse wants to take the Mothership back so they can nuke history even more than Flynn? Sister... you ain't seen nothing yet. Flynn's the only thing standing in their way. But it's not enough. I can't risk them getting the Mothership. So I'm gonna destroy it. And I hope to God you and Rufus... will blow up yours, too. There'll be people who don't want you to. Don't trust them. And don't trust Connor Mason. So I'm just supposed to believe everything that you're telling me right now? Tell your government agent to turn on her satellites.
