 Previously on Timeless... 
 How do you know the name "Rittenhouse"? 
 How do you think I met your father? 
 It's in your blood. 
 They're not trying to kill her. He was trying to recruit her. 
 I'm ready. 
 I was told if she disrupted the mission, you wouldn't be impartial enough to make the decision. 
 Mom, be on the right side of history. Mom! 
 Nicholas Keynes. 
 That's the soldier that they saved and brought back to the present. 
 This manifesto. Nicholas Keynes wrote it. 
 You're with Rittenhouse. 
 And who are you? 
 I'm your granddaughter. 
 I didn't know you were married. Jessica died. 
 Does it mean that you have to live the rest of your life without anyone else? 
 Maybe I do need to be open to possibilities. 
 Jessica? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Alice Parker. 
 The Colony of Massachusetts Bay has found you guilty of witchcraft. 
 What say you? 
 They have found wrong. I am no witch! 
 Then you will meet the same fate as the seven who came before you this afternoon. 
 No! I am not guilty of the charge! 
 You will be hanged from the neck until dead. 
 But I am not guilty of the charge! 
 Can you not learn silence, woman? 
 Look where your untamed mouth has landed you. 
 Judge, I beg you! 
 Move along, Alice. It is time. 
 Alice Parker, the conclusion of your life will bring justice to the good people of Salem. 
 Now, depart from this world. 
 Depart from this world, and trouble us no further! 
 Hang her now! 
 It's you. What are you doing here? 
 Mark, where the hell were you? Happy hour is about to start. 
 Sorry, Jess. 
 Jess, how are you? 
 And bring me two more cases of IPA, ‘cause I ordered four. 
 When is your shift over? Can we have dinner? 
 You ignore my texts for two months, and now, you wanna have dinner? 
 Two months? 
 Where did they send you this time? The Moon? 
 “Who? ~The Army. 
 Unless you've been with someone else these past eight weeks, while I've been working doubles. 
 I came here as soon as I got your text. 
 Well, I'm a little busy right now. 
 So, we're going to have to do this later. 
 Where are you staying? 
 Where am I staying? 
 I'll be right with you, Gary. Yeah. 
 I'll send you the address. 
 Okay, I'll come by after work. 
 Trousers? 
 Excuse me? 
 When did women begin dressing like men? 
 About 1922. 
 Couple of years after we rescued you from that battlefield. 
 You're going to damage your ears. 
 The shelling in the Great War has already seen to that. 
 "World War 1," I mean. 
 Fast learner. Runs in the family. 
 I dislike that exertion machine. 
 Yes, but we now know that exercise is vital to our health, and will help you recover from the surgery. 
 Consider it gone. 
 Have you been catching up on the reading? 
 Everything you prepared for me, the history books, family records, our enemies. 
 This Garcia Flynn... He's locked up. Thanks to Lucy. 
 Right. What I'm about to suggest won't be easy to hear. 
 Something must be done about Lucy. 
 Nicholas, Lucy is your great-granddaughter. 
 Emma filled me in on her exploits. It's quite troubling. 
 -Lucy is misguided. -She's a bad seed. 
 You know... Lucy had an opportunity to join us. 
 But she refused, and she's hampered our efforts. 
 If you can't take care of her... No, I can handle my own daughter. 
 Bully. Now, go earn your stripes. 
 God! -Sorry. 
 Sorry. I blast the volume. I got to tell you something. 
 But you have to promise to stay calm. 
 What are you talking about? What's wrong? 
 Promise you're not going to panic. 
 Okay, now, there is zero percent chance of that happening, so, why don't you just tell me? Okay, right. 
 Something happened to my head in the Lifeboat, but I'm okay, I'm totally fine. 
 But the seizures are more than seizures. 
 They're premonitions. 
 Of the future. 
 And lately, they've been of your future. 
 Look, don't worry. I have a confession. 
 I see dead people. 
 What? You're serious? 
 Look, I had a vision of you with your arm hurt. 
 And then you came back from 1955 with your arm hurt. 
 That's a coincidence, okay? People hurt their arms! 
 I had another one. It was worse. You're going to do something bad. 
 Bad, like, I'm gonna forget your birthday? 
 Or bad like I screw up the Louisiana Purchase? 
 The second one. 
 Look, Rufus, you've got to believe me, okay? These visions are real. 
 Look, I'm trying, but even for a time-traveling black guy, this is a little hard to swallow. 
 They're real. I saw it. 
 You were in colonial times, I think. You're covered in blood, and you're aiming a musket at this Pilgrim-looking guy with a scar on his left cheek. 
 And he is begging for his life. 
 Then you kill him. 
 Maybe he's a bad guy. 
 Or maybe it's the first Thanksgiving, and I'm covered in cranberry sauce. 
 Right. Maybe. 
 The Mothership landed in Salem, Massachusetts, -September 22, 1692. -Pilgrims? 
 It's the height of the witch trials. 
 Lucy, try Wyatt again. He needs to get the hell back here. 
 I keep trying. I've called him like 20 times! 
 -Lucy? -Where have you been? 
 I've been calling you for hours. 
 -I'm worried sick. -Lucy. 
 -What is going on? Lucy. 
 What? 
 Jessica is alive. 
 Somehow, we changed history, and she's alive again. 
 That's... I don't... 
 How is that possible? I don't know. She texted me. 
 I step off the Lifeboat, and I get a text from my dead wife. 
 I don't understand. 
 Did we change something that brought her back? 
 I don't know, but she's real, Lucy. 
 Her hair is a little different, it's shorter, but her eyes are the same. 
 Last time I saw those eyes, she was dead. 
 But apparently, she has lived for six years that I don't know anything about. 
 And I guess I wasn't a good husband, or something and... 
 Well, now, you have time to change all that. 
 -Don't you? -Yeah. 
 Lucy... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Wyatt, I'm thrilled for you. 
 Yeah, but you and me... 
 She's your wife, and you love her. 
 This is everything that you've wanted. Everything that you've been hoping for. 
 This is a good thing. 
 And now, that Jessica is back... Yeah. 
 Why did you call? 
 Is everything okay? 
 -Did the Mothership jump? -No. 
 Everything is fine here. Just focus on figuring things out with Jessica. 
 Take whatever time you need, okay? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. 
 Lucy? 
 -Wyatt's not coming. -You talked to him? 
 Jessica is alive. 
 Oh, my God! 
 -Jessica is... -Jessica was dead? 
 Oh, my God! Yeah! In our timeline, she was. 
 History must have changed when we were back in the past. 
 According to the logs, while we were in 1941, the Mothership jumped for like an hour. 
 San Diego, 1980. 
 “What? -That must have changed history. 
 They were only gone for such a short trip. 
 It doesn't make any sense, unless... 
 Maybe Rittenhouse found Jessica's killer and stopped the b*st*rd. 
 Are you saying that Rittenhouse brought Jessica back? 
 But why the hell would they do that? 
 I don't know. Maybe to throw Wyatt off? 
 You know, he quits the team, starts a family. 
 See how well we did last time we tried to replace him. 
 Okay, right now, Rittenhouse is in Salem, possibly ripping history apart, and we're short a soldier. 
 Wyatt is doing what he has to do, and so should we. 
 We can go after them with or without a soldier. 
 It'd be better with. 
 The 22nd was the deadliest day of the witch trials. 
 -Going to be brutal. -No way. 
 You stole the time machine, you killed innocent people... 
 And you busted me out of jail. 
 The NSA suspects the Iranians, and I plan on keeping it that way. 
 You are staying put. 
 Why do we have him here if we aren't going to use him? 
 We're using him for intel, not muscle. Come on, guys. 
 Fighting the good fight through time is kind of my wheelhouse. 
 And I know all about Salem. 
 Burned a couple witches in your day? 
 Witches weren't burned in Salem, they were hanged. 
 Of the accused, only those who refused to confess were executed. 
 And it all came to a head on the 22nd, when the final victims were all hanged from the same tree, one by one. 
 He's right. That's all true. 
 So, he's seen The Crucible. 
 He's still the guy that tried to get me shot. 
 He's still a killer, Lucy. 
 He's a time-traveling killer, and we share the same enemy. 
 I mean, come on, you can't deny that Flynn has been effective. 
 Look, we are going to colonial New England. 
 A woman and a black man should travel with someone who has more access. 
 I couldn't agree more. 
 Look, I kept my word and I got you out of that cell. 
 I need to know that I can trust you on this. 
 -Can I? -No. 
 The answer is "no." You cannot trust him. 
 Can 1? 
 Okay. 
 Lucy is in charge, and you will follow her lead. 
 Deal. Now, let's go find some decent clothes. 
 We'll figure that out once we get to Salem. 
 -I'll just take a gun. -Hell no! 
 If I'm going to be flying that thing, there's no way he takes a gun. 
 I have a thing against getting shot in the back. 
 Like that's the only way I'd be able to kill you. 
 I knew living with Flynn was going to suck, but this is much worse. 
 Little trouble with your seatbelt? 
 I can see why this Lifeboat was such a failed design. 
 It's cramped, cluttered, not very impressive. 
 Still beat your ass most of the time. 
 There we go. All set. 
 Careful. First-time travelers tend to get a little nauseous. 
 Not my first trip, pal. This isn't the Mothership. 
 I know. Flying coach sucks. 
 Come on. Cheer up, kids. This will be fun. 
 There it is. 
 That's Proctor's Ledge. 
 A few hours from now, innocent people will be hanged in that very spot. 
 Poor women. Some men, too. The ones that spoke up. 
 It's all just awful. 
 Maybe we can keep it from getting worse. 
 Which it easily could with a sleeper agent somewhere back there. 
 Figured Salem would be creepy. I just thought there would be more people. 
 These are dangerous, paranoid times. 
 The noisier the accusations got, the more people stayed inside. 
 Nobody wanted to be spotted near the woods, where the made-up rituals were said to take place. 
 The woods? Where we are. Great. 
 You do realize that witches aren't real, right? 
 Then what do you call that? 
 No, no, don't do that. 
 Rule number one, don't run towards a demonic entity. 
 -Hello, there. Who are you? -Abby, here. 
 Who asks? 
 I'm Isaiah, and this is my manservant. 
 Easy, Isaiah. 
 I thought you guys used aliases. 
 My name is Lucy, and this is Rufus. We're in from Boston. 
 Here to be entertained by this afternoon's hangings, I imagine. 
 Murder in Salem? Let the judges be judged. 
 Looks like we agree these trials are unfair. 
 These trials are more than unfair. They are murderous. 
 Women are dying, innocent women. 
 That may not vex you, but it vexes me. 
 We are vexed, but what my wife failed to explain was that we're here because we wanted to help. 
 Help? Me? 
 Yes, my husband and I are from the Old South Church in Boston. 
 Reverend Willard sent us. 
 My apology. I easily ruffle, and friends have been few recently. 
 You do realize how dangerous it is to speak out on a day like today. 
 I couldn't live with myself if I stayed quiet. 
 I must say something. Which is what I will soon do at Ingersoll's Tavern. 
 Tavern? 
 Beer is proof that God wants us to be happy. 
 This is where you've been staying? 
 Well, it's better that that dump we stayed in on our honeymoon. 
 Remember that night? 
 Yeah. Do you remember the last time we saw each other? 
 And then you disappeared for two months without saying anything. 
 Do you remember that? 
 Yeah, I remember some of it. 
 But my memory is a little hazy. 
 It's been a rough couple of months. Can you remind me? 
 You're serious? 
 The last time I saw you was the night we met with Todd. 
 Right. 
 Who's Todd? 
 Todd. Dr. Todd Jankowski, the marriage counselor. 
 You still haven't learned his name? 
 Look, this isn't how I wanted to do this, but it's only fair I do it in person, so... 
 It's divorce papers. 
 You already signed them. 
 We have to face it. We're not the couple we wanted to be. 
 I've changed, Jess. You're drunk five nights a week! 
 You're jealous. And everytime I leave, you beg me to stay, you promise you'll change, and you do change, and then three weeks later, you just change right back. 
 I'm done. 
 I've just been going through some stuff. 
 I'm begging you, please. Give me one more chance. 
 Together forever, right? Wyatt, we're never together. 
 You have some fantasy of what this marriage is. 
 You're putting me on this pedestal. I'm not that person. 
 You know what? You are to me. 
 I need you. 
 Order! Silence in the tavern! 
 Bring in the prisoners. That's John Hathorne. 
 The Justice of the Peace overseeing the witch trials. 
 Last week, a petition was submitted to Governor Phips, begging for the guilty verdict to be overturned, and the accused to be released. 
 Well, I have his reply right here, received just in the nick of time. 
 The nine accused witches... 
 Nine? I thought there was supposed to be eight. 
 Will be executed! 
 Yeah! -As planned! 
 Stop! 
 I call for a new trial. 
 On what grounds? 
 On the grounds that there is no such thing as a witch. 
 Stop! 
 The marks on Mary's hand appeared after her neighbor's hogs were found dead. 
 The hogs she choked to death in a sacrifice to the devil. 
 Those hogs died of starvation. 
 Because her neighbor is a drunk, not because she is a witch. 
 Martha was heard casting spells on us all as she walked through town. 
 She talks to the birds. 
 She's eccentric. Being eccentric is not a crime. 
 Her accuser was struck blind during her trial. The result of a spell. 
 Her accuser is a 12-year-old girl with an active imagination. 
 The only one who is blind here is you! 
 Settle down. 
 In order to administer justice on these nine condemned souls, I must read this order of the court. 
 -Nine souls. ~The final conviction... 
 Who's the ninth? 
 After very reliable accusation. 
 Who is Abiah Franklin? 
 Right here. 
 I am Abby Franklin. 
 No, no, no. This can't happen. What can't happen? 
 Abiah Franklin, you have been convicted of witchcraft, and are hereby sentenced to be hanged. 
 Arrest her with the others. 
 She can't die. She cannot die. Lucy, who's Abby? 
 Abby Franklin is Benjamin Franklin's mother. 
 If she's executed today, Benjamin Franklin will never be born. 
 Stop! Stop, please! 
 How can you not see? If we do not hang together, we will all hang separately! Cowards! 
 That woman is Benjamin Franklin's mother? 
 Not yet. She won't give birth to him for another 14 years. 
 So, Rittenhouse is using the Salem witch trials to take out Benjamin Franklin. Why would they do that? 
 Think about it. 
 Franklin made it okay for us to criticize the people in charge. 
 Killing Ben Franklin, or everything that he stands for, it's a step towards tyranny. 
 Tell me you're done looking for a weapon. 
 Damn Puritans! No one even has a butter knife. 
 -Happy now? -A little bit. 
 There. That's the guy Jiya told me about. 
 What guy? Look, I got to tell you something. 
 I know this is going to sound crazy, but ever since Jiya took that ride in the Lifeboat, she's been having visions. 
 -Visions of what? ~The future. 
 My future. 
 Even before the Mothership jumped here, she saw me kill some Pilgrim-looking guy with a scar on his left cheek. 
 If she's fantasizing about Puritans, you've got bigger problems, man. 
 If I'm going to kill a guy, wouldn't it make sense it's some sleeper agent Rittenhouse embedded in Salem? 
 See! Look. That's him. The scar on his left cheek. 
 What? That guy's too feeble to be the sleeper agent. 
 That's who Jiya warned me about. 
 Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going? 
 I want to see if your girlfriend's crystal ball works. 
 What are you doing here? Came in to make water. 
 Let me go. 
 Tell us what you know about Abby Franklin. 
 I know nothing about that! Many accus... 
 Flynn, can we hear him talk? 
 -Please? -You are no fun. 
 Speak. 
 Many accusations are reported to us by those closest to the accused. 
 -What do you mean by "us"? ~The judges. I work under Hathorne. 
 Sewall, Samuel. You're Judge Samuel Sewall. 
 Papal Betty, get out of here at once. 
 Please. Not in front of the child. 
 Papa, what's happening? Who are they? 
 If you tell anyone about any of this, and I'm going to come after you. You understand me? 
 -Papal -Do you understand? 
 Get the hell out of here. Now! 
 Well, then who is it, then? 
 I mean, if he's not the sleeper, who accused Abby? 
 He did say accusations often come from people who are closest to the accused. 
 Ben Franklin's aunt. 
 Of course. Abby's sister was one of the most outspoken accusers in Salem. 
 Any idea where to find her? 
 If something happened to you... 
 You're the one going off on secret missions all over the world. 
 You're worried something is going to happen to me? 
 -Jess... -What? At the bar? 
 Listen, you don't get how rare this is. 
 What we have and how it can all be taken away like that. 
 Right. Because a soldier's wife has no idea what it's like to live in fear for someone she loves. 
 You know what? 
 You're right. I can't imagine what it's like to be married to me. 
 I'm never there, and when I am, it's like I'm not even there. 
 Yeah, that's bull, and you know it. 
 I put up with the cold dinners and the lonely nights because I am proud of you and what you do. 
 But the whispered conversations that end the minute I come into the room, the partial answers, the half truths, it's just... 
 I love you. 
 But I can't be married to a state secret. 
 No. I'm going to tell you everything. 
 The whole truth. 
 But you got to come with me. 
 You know, in the play, all the Salem accusers were teenage girls. 
 In reality, some of the most vicious accusers were adults. 
 Abby's sister, Bathsheba, and her husband included. 
 Maybe they're involved in this. 
 You're not as fearful as I remember. 
 All that time alone with Rittenhouse has toughened you up? 
 "Cause if you think that was bad, you should try six months in solitary. 
 You at least had some people to talk to. 
 You're right. 
 My mother and I had some amazing heart-to-hearts while I was her prisoner. 
 That has to be the house. 
 Yeah, I think I'm going to pass on the Puritan Chainsaw Massacre. 
 Maybe I should scope out the jailhouse, see if there's a way to get Abby out. 
 -Be careful? Yeah. 
 And meet us back at that tavern, okay? 
 Boston is 15 miles away. Must have taken you two all day. 
 You're welcome to stay for dinner. We're having venison. 
 No, we're not hungry. 
 Venison? You're a hunter? 
 No, I haven't touched a gun in years. I'm a God-fearing man. 
 We hope to speak to you and your wife together. 
 -Bathsheba, was it? -That's right. 
 -Strong name. -Strong woman. 
 -You journeyed from Boston. -That's right. 
 Salem has had all sorts of visitors. These trials have touched us all. 
 In fact, Joseph told me just today, my own sister has been convicted of taking up the Dark Arts and will soon be punished. 
 A blessing, I suppose. 
 If not for Abby, then for our village to be freed from such evil. 
 Cut the crap, Bathsheba. 
 I know that you've been making up lies, accusing women of witchcraft. 
 Martha Corey was your neighbor, wasn't she? 
 And you got into a dispute over a property line, and that's why you accused her. 
 You may have everyone else in Salem fooled, but you don't fool me. 
 What makes you think you can know such things? 
 How did they get you to do it? Did they threaten you, did they bribe you? 
 You sold out your sister for money, didn't you? 
 How dare you? Who wanted you to accuse her? 
 I demand that you leave at once! 
 We will not be spoken to in such a manner in our own home! 
 We will speak how we speak. 
 -No! Stop! Stop! -No. 
 You're right. I have accused women, but not Abby. 
 
 
 
 Not my own sister. 
 It's not going to be as easy as you think. 
 Apparently, Puritans can really build a jail. 
 We have to get Abby out of there. 
 I vote blood bath, but I just need to find a damn musket. 
 -Crap. It's Sewall. “What? 
 Rufus, he's not the agent, okay? Just forget about him. 
 Forget about him? Jiya said she saw me kill him. 
 For the past year, everyone kept saying that I was going to become this horrible person. 
 You know what I did? I just walked away. 
 Did you? 
 Do you remember what Flynn used to say? 
 One day, we'll be fighting side by side. Well... 
 You're right. What do I know? 
 Look, I can't pretend to know what you're going through, with Wyatt off with Jessica, and your mom doing whatever it is she's doing, but I'm starting to get this whole fate versus free will thing, and boy, is it a lot! 
 Stay right there, stranger. Need a word with you and your friends. 
 -Get him! -After him! 
 Good thing we got Flynn to help us out. 
 There she is! There's Lucy! 
 Who just said your name? 
 Right there! 
 She's a witch. 
 This is where you work? What is this place? 
 -Just follow me. -Why are we whispering? 
 I just want to show you around, explain a few things first. 
 All right. Let me know if you hear anything. 
 You've got to be kidding me. 
 I understand things change, but you brought her down here? 
 You don't think I want to bring my family down here, too? 
 But we know the drill and we signed up for it. 
 Wyatt, we found out Rittenhouse went back to 1980. 
 San Diego. 
 Rittenhouse changed history and brought Jessica back. 
 What choice did I have? For all I know, she could be in danger. 
 If Rittenhouse brought her back, she could be the danger. 
 You can read me the riot act till you're blue in the face, but she has seen the bunker. It's not a secret anymore. 
 Nothing left for you to do except let her stay. 
 Wyatt... 
 You have no idea what I have been through. 
 Six years ago, I buried my wife, and now, she's back from the dead. 
 What? 
 Jess. 
 Oh, my God! You are Connor Mason. You must be Jessica. 
 You know Connor Mason? 
 Sorry we're meeting again under such circumstances. 
 It's all just so much more awful than I thought. 
 When the trials first started, I knew that being accused was a possibility. 
 But that didn't make it any less painful. 
 My own friends, people I trusted sitting there, as they took me away. 
 I can imagine. 
 The worst part is that they dragged my good name through the mud with me. 
 Dying is one thing. Dying in disgrace? 
 The things they said we did are not true. 
 Look at Alice Parker. 
 They said that she stuck pins in a puppet and killed a man. 
 It was my childhood doll. 
 I just like dolls. 
 And Martha Corey, they said she snuck into the woods to sign the devil's book. 
 It's a lie. I am a Gospel woman. 
 You don't have to defend your reputation to me. 
 You're not like the other women, and that makes people uncomfortable. 
 So, they mock you, and they tell you you're stupid. 
 But you refuse to change. 
 And then that makes people mad, so they attack you, call you evil. 
 They call you a witch. 
 I know that none of that is true. 
 So, you talk to birds, so, you like dolls, so, you refuse to confess to being something that you're not. 
 That's brave. 
 And I'm proud to be in your company. 
 Keep distance from me. 
 You know black and white necks snap just the same, right? 
 Lucy. Lucy, are you okay? 
 Lucy. -How could you do this? 
 You left me no choice. 
 -I had orders. -I'm not talking about me. 
 I'm talking about Benjamin Franklin. 
 How could you send an agent to wipe him from history? 
 There's no agent here. This mission is all me. 
 I accused Abby. 
 It's a necessary sacrifice for a better future. 
 And Wyatt? Why did you bring his wife back? 
 There's no time. 
 If you agree to come back to the present with me, I know we can convince Nicholas. We can go home together. 
 I'm begging you. 
 I'd rather be hanged. 
 You were always so stubborn. 
 Listen to me. Get yourself out of this. 
 I'll find you. I'll take you to the Mothership. 
 This may be your last chance. Mine, too. 
 Time for the gallows. 
 What are you doing here? What did you do to our home? 
 I could see it in your eyes. You have arifle here. 
 -Where is it? -Get out of here. 
 Where is the rifle? 
 Stop right there! 
 I knew it 
 Finally. 
 Make way for these agents of hell. 
 Abiah Franklin. 
 The Colony of Massachusetts Bay has found you guilty of witchcraft. 
 -Any luck? -Not yet. 
 -Let me try. -Okay. 
 Send her to hell! 
 Hang her now! 
 It's Flynn! 
 Hurry. Come on. 
 Abby. We're right here. 
 Lucy! 
 Lucy! 
 Go. Go help them. Gol I'm so glad Flynn found a gun. 
 -Lucy, your arm. -It will be fine. 
 We can still do it, Rufus. We can still save them. 
 -All of them? -We can sure as hell try. 
 All right. I like this Lucy. 
 She may be reckless, Sarah Connor, agrees-with-Flynn Lucy, but I dig her. 
 -Grab his knife. -Got it. 
 -Help me. -Okay, okay. 
 Run, run! 
 -Come on, run as fast as you can! -Go, gol 
 Wait. Thank you. 
 Take all the women to New Hampshire. 
 Stay away from Salem. Next year, come back to Boston. 
 There will be more people there with open minds. 
 -And you? Where will you go? -I'll be fine. 
 You there! You attacked me in that barn, and now, this? 
 Think you can escape? 
 Run. 
 -You cannot do this. -Sewall. 
 Those women have been lawfully convicted. 
 Your laws are a little bit backwards. 
 Just because you do not believe in our laws does not mean that you can break them. 
 Do me a favor. Walk away, just get out of here. 
 Listen to me! Go home! Put down your weapon. 
 Leave me alone, man. 
 I don't want to shoot you. 
 Just go home to your daughter. 
 Please. 
 No! 
 Come on. Keep breathing. 
 I didn't shoot youl You're not supposed to die! 
 -No. -It's okay. 
 Those women today, they were all supposed to die. 
 Pretty big change you were willing to make to history, huh? 
 It's not what I'm willing to do, it's what I'm not willing to do. 
 I can't sit back and watch innocent people die anymore. 
 To hell with what's meant to happen. And to hell with my mother. 
 You're nothing like her. You know? 
 Yeah. I know. 
 Let's go home. I'm starting to miss Wyatt. 
 You hanging in there, Jessica? 
 You don't actually expect me to believe all this, do you? 
 You may want to finish that. Just keep looking. 
 -Try not to freak out. -Okay. 
 Okay, so, wait, the Salem witch revolt wasn't the history you knew before you left. 
 No, the revolt was us. 
 It used to be known as the Salem witch trials. 
 Which is where the term "witch hunt" comes from. 
 Witch hunt? 
 It is... Was an expression that meant going after someone who didn't deserve it. 
 Like what I did to our Pilgrim friend. 
 Didn't go down exactly as you said it would, but... 
 -Wait, so did you shoot him? -No. 
 But he ended up dead, anyway, because of what you told me. 
 Your visions are why we went after him, why he followed us, why he died. 
 So, you're saying what happened was my fault. 
 How can you hold me responsible for something that was bound to happen? 
 That's the thing! It wasn't bound to happen. 
 We bound it to happen. 
 Trying to avoid this whole thing is why I ran head first into it. 
 It's a loop or a paradox. 
 Whatever it is, can't you see how much this messes with my mind? 
 I'm not going to apologize for telling you the truth. 
 I don't want you to apologize. 
 I just think, maybe, you were right. 
 Maybe you shouldn't tell me what's in your visions. 
 It's freezing in here. 
 Do you know how long I waited for this meal? 
 Three minutes. I never even left the automobile. 
 Tacos. Fast food. Drive through. 
 Drive through. 
 It muddles the mind. What do people do all day? Everything is so easy. 
 Nicholas, about today. 
 That terrorist, Flynn, showed up in Salem. 
 He is how Lucy got away. Was that how it happened? 
 I'm taking you off the Lucy assignment. That's not necessary. 
 Some of us are willing to do difficult things in order to survive. 
 And some of us aren't. 
 It's clear you can't do what needs to be done. 
 It's not your fault. You're only a mother. 
 Nicholas, think about our family. 
 -Our future. -l am. 
 And you don't need to worry about Lucy anymore. 
 She's our problem now. 
 Sorry, this is the only place we could speak privately. 
 This is not going to be easy for you to understand. 
 But when you died... 
 -I'm alive, Wyatt! -I know. 
 But you weren't. 
 Six years ago, in my reality, we were driving and we got into a fight. 
 And you got out of the car, and... 
 I let you go. 
 I went back home. 
 And I waited for you to come back, and you never came back. 
 Because you were dead. 
 -You had been murdered. -In your reality. 
 I identified your body, Jess. 
 I watched the coroner put you in the back of the van. 
 I grieved at your funeral. I cried with your family. 
 My whole world ended that night. 
 That's impossible. 
 Until Connor Mason invented a time machine. 
 This is real, Jess. 
 So, when I tell you that I've changed, I am literally not the same guy that you have known for the last six years. 
 I don't know who that guy was, or what he did, but I'm sure he deserved to lose you. 
 But I am begging you. 
 Please give me one last chance. 
 Please.
