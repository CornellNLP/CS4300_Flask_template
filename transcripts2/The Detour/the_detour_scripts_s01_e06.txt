 Man : Why did they stay at a B&B?? 
 Woman : It was a nice B&B. 
 I thought the mission was that he had to get to Fort Lauderdale to get his job back in a blaze of glory. 
 Yeah, but the wife didn't know that. 
 She likes B&Bs. It was a really nice B&B. 
 What kind of people would stay at a place run by a pedophile? 
 Plot twist... they didn't know that. 
 That Russian girl was 16. 
 Yeah, but they assumed that the old guy was interested in the mom. 
 Are you almost done with him? I want my turn. 
 Yeah. I'm about halfway through.

 [Fire alarm beeping] 
 [Groans] Damn it. Ah-ha! 
 [Beeping stops, magazine thuds] 
 God. 
 I've got such a headache. 
 That makes two of us. 
 The only thing helping me is this sweet tea. 
 I swear I'm addicted to it. 
 My lord! [Chuckles] 
 What... what is happening in here? 
 We wanted to say "thank you," so we cooked for you. 
 [Laughs] 
 And at what ungodly temperature did we cook these eggs? 
 Um, the temperature you cook eggs at... high. 
 Ah, yeah, really hot. 
 [Chuckles] Yes, well, that is not cooking, Nate. 
 That is an egg-secution. [Chuckles] 
 Hey, before we leave... 
 Yes? 
 I wanna give you something. 
 No. 
 Yes, please. I recently became ordained. 
 Weird story. Um, and I wanna be the one to marry you guys. 
 Wait. What?! 
 Yeah, what? 
 Yeah. I think this is why I became a minister. 
 No, you became a minister to piss off that dude at the restaurant. 
 [Laughs] Oh, my Sweet Lord thundering Jesus! 
 Yeah, before you start crying there, Rob, we don't have time for a wedding. 
 All I have to do is sign a piece of paper. 
 W-would you have time for a  little  ceremony? 
 God, no. 
 It would mean the world to my little lady. 
 Ew! 
 Please, we'd be hitched by noon, I swear. 
 Okay. I'd be... I'd be honored to. 
 [Laughing] 
 Oh, my lord! Oh! Mwah! Mwah! Oh! 
 Yeah, just... uh, no, no. 
 Mwah! 
 Oh! Mwah! [Chuckles] Wait till I tell the ladies. 
 Okay, noon. Noon. 
 Oh, ladies? Ladies! 
 What the hell? What's that about? 
 I just wanna give them what we have. 
 What we have is 500 miles to drive. 
 Yeah, but we came and we disrupted their lives, and I just feel like we owe them something. 
 Yeah, we actually do... $230 for a night's stay. 
 Or how about you can support me on this? 
 I think it's disgusting. 
 Whoa! What? 
 The two of them together is just gross! 
 It should be illegal! 
 All right, I'm done with this. 
 Come with me. 
 Dad, help me on this! 
 I'm not gonna help you, you little bigot. 
 Let me show you something. 
 See that crazy old man right there? 
 He comes here every day... 
 Hey! 
 To protest the love in this house. 
 Yeah, and he's right. 
 Certain people just don't belong together. 
 Hold on. 
 What? 
 I hope this is the fever talking. 
 This lack of compassion and tolerance is very disappointing. 
 That is not the little girl I raised. 
 You guys are disgusting. 
 What was that? 
 I told you, we should've had more Jewish friends. 
 [Whispers] You never told me that. 
 Yeah, you suck! We're friends of the Jewish people! 
 We don't have any. 
 We've got a couple. 
 No, not one.

 Vanessa, hey, it's Nate. I need to... oh, sh1t, this guy is rich. 
 Hey, uh, uh, I need to know if you sent that product, okay? 
 It's very important you call me, so pull your head out of that big mound of coke and... 
 [Beeps] 
 Hold on a sec. I think this is you. 
 Hello? 
 [Laughing] 
 Hello? Vanessa? 
 So you still coming down to Fort Lauderdale, huh, you dipshit? 
 Uh, Gene? 
 G-Gene? Uh, no, I'm not coming to Fort Lauderdale. 
 Why would you think that? What? [Chuckles] 
 Because you're still using the corporate credit card, you dummy. 
 Listen, Nate, I don't know why you're doing this. 
 I don't know if you're trying to embarrass me. 
 I don't know if you're trying to sell this product to another company. 
 Hey, man, I thought you cared about this company. 
 [Laughter] 
 Of course I care. What are you talking about, man? 
 I care more than anyone else. 
 Shh. 
 I put so much on the line for this! 
 I lied to my wife, I lied to my family because I care so goddamn much. 
 [Laughter] 
 I  told  you he would cry, right? 
 You girls owe me shots, shots, shots. 
 Am I on speakerphone? 
 Oh, yeah. Me and the ladies, we needed a new drinking game. 
 [Laughter] 
 So, uh, listen, I'll let you go. 
 You drive safe, sweetheart. 
 [Laughter] 
 No, you listen to me,  sweetheart,  okay? 
 I  am  coming to Fort Lauderdale, and when I get there, I am gonna find you and I am going to [Bleep] you so [Bleep] hard, you... 
 Mmm. 
 I knew you were a bad guy. 
 This is where I come to be bad. 
 I'm a good guy. [Chuckles] 
 Ah. Good guy, bad guy, it's all perception. 
 Me? I say I'm just a woman. 
 You  say I'm exceptional woman. 
 I never said that. 
 Yes, you do. I see how you look. 
 No, I look. I don't say that. 
 Yeah, but, you know, in my village, I'm just average woman. 
 Like fourth most attractive sister in family. 
 Bullshit. Don't buy that story for a second. Okay? 
 Yeah. 
 You are, objectively, the most attractive woman in every village. 
 [Clicks tongue] Aw. There are no absolutes. 
 No, there are absolutely absolutes, okay? 
 Vinyl? Absolutely overrated. 
 Dr. Rob? Absolutely super-duper rich. 
 Yes. 
 And absolutely the best car in this garage? 
 Lime green 'cuda. 
 This American sh1t? 
 Point is, I'm a good guy. 
 Oh, no, you're a bad guy, sweetheart. 
 But... I keep your secret. 
 [Singsongy] Bad guy. 
 There's no secrets. 
 See you later, bad guy. 
 Bad guys don't turn that down. Okay? 
 [Under breath] Jesus Christ. 
 What are you doing? 
 Watching my girlfriend. 
 I got some bad news. 
 Your girlfriend's marrying that creepy old dude. 
 That's just her Dad. 
 She was kissing him. 
 You kiss Dad. 
 Not like  that.

 [Candy rattles, bowls thuds] 
 I cannot tell you how excited my baby is right now. 
 So I'm not familiar with Jewish weddings. 
 Is there anything special? A request you might have? 
 We are far from traditionalists down here, Robin. 
 Just speak from the h... oh. Dagnabbit. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, god. More protestors? 
 Guess some folks from the church must've gotten wind of the festivities. 
 I'm still so shocked that that kind of anti-semitism exists down here. 
 Yes, well, it may not be  just  the Jewish thing. 
 Yeah, but still, they're just backwards, pigheaded philistines. 
 Some people have taken issue with our age difference. 
 Well, she could be younger. I mean, hey. 
 [Chuckles] Yes, well, legally, I suppose she could, but I couldn't very well push her down the aisle in a stroller. 
 [Laughs loudly] 
 Still, even my late wife... she came to me in a dream last night, told me, "it ain't right." 
 Listen to me. 
 Your dead ghost wife is wrong. 
 If you've been lucky enough to find love... 
 I have. 
 You have, so nothing should stop you from grabbing onto it and holding onto it forever. 
 [Chuckles] Oh! 
 Uh-oh. They're unloading the hate bus. 
 Protestors : [Chanting] Not in our town! 
 Not in our town! 
 The racists down here are really organized. 
 This makes me really,  really  angry. 
 They're gonna ruin everything. Nate, go get rid of them. 
 No, no, no. Deep breath. Just ignore them. 
 I've learned to rise above the bigotry. 
 Well, guess what, pal? I haven't.

 Hey! Hey! 
 [Shouting indistinctly] 
 Get outta here! We're having a wedding! 
 Not if we have anything to say about it. 
 Oh, yeah?! 
 That's right. 
 Get outta here! Get outta here! 
 [Woman screams] 
 Let Carl and his young, beautiful child through! 
 Man : Why don't you stop doing that?! 
 Come on, Carl! 
 Get away from them! 
 Carl : Get away from the clown car... 
 Nate : It's gonna be okay, sweetheart. 
 You asshole! 
 She shouldn't have to bear witness to your hate! 
 You like that?! It's the hose of justice! 
 The hose of just... oh.

 Well, obviously, I'm not gonna spray you. 
 How can you defend him? 
 He's a pediatrician, for god sakes. 
 We trusted him with our children. 
 Yeah, so did I, and he's got a very gentle hand. 
 Don't use us as propaganda! 
 What are you guys doing over there? Get in here. 
 We're on the right side! 
 No, you're not! 
 Fine, you're gonna have to spray... 
 Dad, I can't believe you sprayed... aah! 
 Protestors : Ohh! 
 Aah! 
 Get in here and get changed for the wedding. 
 What the hell?! 
 Seriously! Aah! 
 We've got you on camera. You're gonna regret this. 
 Really? Regret standing up against your ignorant prejudice? 
 Yeah, go ahead. Tape me. 
 Uh, my name is Nate Parker, and I stand for true love. 
 Put that on your Facebook pages. 
 I just did. Aah! 
 Dad! 
 Aah! 
 Get in! 
 [Accordion playing] 
 Although I've only officially been a minister for two days, I feel like everything happens for a reason. 
 And I'm so honored to stand here for love because love is right. 
 Thank you for that. 
 Congratulations.

 Holy sh1t. 
 I don't think I can marry you. 
 Well, I don't wanna marry  you.  I-I wanna marry  her. 
 [Men laugh] 
 Man : Hey, good one, Rob. 
 I-I can't do this 'cause she's 16. 
 That's right. The numerical inversion of my 61. 
 According to the ancient laws of Jewish mysticism, we complete each other. 
 Gross. Nate? Do you wanna say something? 
 [Lowered voice] I'm so sorry I sprayed you. 
 Whoa, now... now... now I'm an intuitive man. 
 I'm starting to get the idea that you two don't approve of this union. 
 Now whatever happened to, and I quote, "What is wrong with these backwards, pigheaded philistines?" 
 Oh, no, that's when I thought she was Jewish. 
 Oksana : She  is  Jewish. 
 What got to do with it? You are anti-semite? 
 No! I... hold... well, hold on. Is this even legal? 
 Well, of course it's legal. 
 Man : Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

 13! 
 12! 
 10!

 Why even even put a number on it? 
 Because the federal elitists are suggesting 18. 
 [Men shout indistinctly] 
 No! It's  our  choice! 
 That's why I am proposing 16. 
 No! It's too old! 
 They call it lucky 7 for a reason!

 Your ex-wife... she haunts you. Even she thinks this is wrong. 
 Oh, grow up, Robin. There's no such thing as ghosts. 
 Nate, can you please help me? 
 Technically... 
 He's right. 
 What? 
 Yes. 
 I... but you're also right. It feels... Very wrong. 
 Yeah. 
 But that is not for you to judge. 
 You know, if... if he wants to do this... 
 I do. 
 And she, for some reason, wants to do this... 
 Yes, please. 
 Nate : And she approves... 
 Yes, of course. 
 Then... 
 Well, it sounds like we just completed our vows. 
 Robin, let's make this official. 
 Somebody please object. 
 I object! Because I love her!

 I know, but she's just a child, Nate. 
 Mm-hmm, and that's called child abduction, which is a crime, unlike what they're doing. 
 So you're just gonna side with him? 
 I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do! 
 You think you're saving her from beautiful life as wife of rich doctor, followed by even better life as widow of rich doctor with no heirs? 
 Well, there has to be more to marriage than money. 
 You think she gold digger? 
 No, I think  you  gold digger. 
 Look at you with your bracelets and that ring. 
 That  ring.  How much did you pay for that ring?

 No, it's a small dose. It's nothing. 
 And man like you absorb, no problem. 
 Oh, now you're calling me fat? 
 No, you're not fat. Listen, what I'm saying is that with all the amount of secrets between us, we have only the bad parts of an affair. 
 We don't have the good parts. 
 So, um, what do you say? 
 One quickie? One for the road? Deal? 
 We'll have s*x, and then I'll shut up about this? 
 Yes, you shut up. 
 And we, what, do it beside the dead guy? 
 Well, no talking there. We can go there or there. You choose. 
 You're insane. 
 Insane. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 Absolutely insane! 
 Come back. 
 Bad guy, come on. 
 I'm a good guy.
