 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Nate. 
 Hi. 
 Nice to meet you. Um, you're a piece of sh1t. 
 We doing it? 
 God, yeah, we're gonna do it. 
 [Grunts, Exhales Sharply] 
 Hey, what's your name again? 
 What do you do for money? 
 I got a job at this bio-tech pharma company. 
 You're fired, Nate. 
 Twins? That's super scary. 
 I know. What do you do with twins? 
 So, when did you get married? 
 And do you take Robin to be your lawfully wedded wife? 
 Sí. 
 And do you, Robin, take Carlos as your lawfully wedded husband? 
 I...I do. 
 Who the hell is Carlos? 
 I married him so that I could help him get his green card, and he paid for my college. 
 Wait, so guys aren't actually married? 
 Nope. 
 No, I couldn't find Carlos to get the annulment before you guys arrived, so we never really got around to doing it. 
 Nate, I'm guilty. 
 No, you're not. We haven't been charged. 
 You took enough for four people. 
 Well, drugs are for people. 
 Wait, so  Mom's  the loser? 
 Yes. 
 Am I in trouble? 
 We are looking for this woman. 
 Robin Randall. 
 AKA... 
 AKA... 
 AKA... 
 Just how well do you know your wife? 
 Who are you? 
 I can't tell you. 
 What's your name? 
 I can't tell you. 
 I don't have a name. 
 What are you, a spy? 
 No. 
 You're an assassin. 
 No. 
 You're involved in something dangerous. 
 Uh... 
 You said you shot someone. 
 No, I said I may have been involved in some people losing their lives. 
 So you're a criminal. 
 Some government agencies have their eye on me. 
 Should I be afraid of you? 
 You should be cautious. 
 God, I am so, so confused right now. 
 We don't have much more time. 
 Then tell me. 
 I can't. 
 I don't want to play anymore, so tell me. 
 Listen. Why don't you just calm down and try and think. 
 I am done playing this game. 
 [Timer Rings] 
 Yes, you are, 'cause your time's up. 
 She was a mosquito. 
 I thought that right away. 
 God, you guys are so intense. 
 Third question in, you said animal. 
 A mosquito's not an animal. 
 Yeah, but it's more an animal than a vegetable or mineral. 
 What kind of assassin can fly? 
 Um, all of them, Janice. 
 You two really pushed the boundaries of yes or no answers. [Laughs] 
 Oh, really? We're the ones who write words in Pictionary. 
 We don't write words in Pictionary. 
 You wrote "Walmart." 
 It's the sign on the store. 
 The clue was Walmart. 
 And it still took you three guesses. 
 Excuse me, your husband pulled out his you-know-what last week. 
 Yeah, and I got "nuts" in one guess. 
 Yeah. How else would you get nuts? 
 Uh... 
 What's that? That's... That's having a stroke. 
 You look like a mental patient. 
 Are you... Oh. What are you, hanging yourself? 
 What is... No! 
 No, you ca... 
 No props! 
 Whatever! 
 You guys are the biggest cheaters we've ever played with. 
 [Chuckles] Oh, please, Janice. 
 I think you know a little more about cheating on things than we do. 
 What? 
 I think we better call it a day. 
 [Sighs] I thought they'd worked it out. 
 It's only been a month. 
 God, I can't believe we're still living in a trailer park. 
 And day drinking. 
 Playing games on a Wednesday. 
 This sucks. 
 Hey, babe. Something's gonna come along. 
 I mean, it always does, right? 
 Good things happen to good people. 
 [Sighs] 
 And who's better than us? 
 Nobody. 
 No. 
 When did you know? 
 I knew the second you stopped letting me cut your hair!

 Oh, hi. How are you? I'm here to meet... 
 Sir, this is a jacket-required club. 
 Oh, okay. 
 I didn't wear one 'cause it's, you know, it's hot out, so... 
 We can get you a house jacket. 
 House jacket. All right. 
 Cool. That's awesome. 
 Never been part of a club before. 
 It's like I won the Masters. 
 Do you have grown-up sizes, or...? 
 What the hell are you wearing, son? 
 Oh, it's... it's the house jacket. 
 They said it was a rule. 
 Oh. 
 I never met a rule I couldn't break with the purchase of a $300 Scotch. 
 Hey, sweetheart, set us up here, will you? 
 Make them doubles. 
 Yeah, can I get mine on the rocks? 
 What, do you live in a trailer? 
 It's a manufactured-home community. 
 But yeah. 
 Ah. 
 J.R. : So, you've been unemployed for a year. 
 Well, you know, it's only been... 
 19 months. 
 On paper, you're good. 
 Thank you. 
 But then I called your old boss. 
 Oh. [Clears Throat] 
 And that's when I found out you were great. 
 [Chuckling] Really? 
 He said that? 
 Oh, no. No, he said you were a dipshit who discharged a fire extinguisher in his face 'cause you disagreed with him. 
 Right. Right. 
 I'm confused. 
 Why am I still here? 
 'Cause I need a man like you. 
 Principled. 
 That guy had no idea what he had in you. 
 You don't get mad at a wolf when it won't sit in your lap and eat bon bons.

 Yes, you will. 
 Yes, indeed. 
 Whoo! 
 Yes! 
 No. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you sure you really want to be going back to New York City? 
 Of course I'm not sure. But what choice do I have? 
 New York! Hey, is everything in your husband's closet going? 
 No, that is gross. 
 Uh, we're just gonna get him a whole new wardrobe. 
 You can have it. Oh. And take the tank top, too. 
 Yes! 
 Hey, why is this in my carry-on? 
 Uh, 'cause it's important. 
 Is that what I think it is? 
 Yes. 
 I didn't know you still had that. 
 Shh. 
 Hey, Whispers. 
 Hm? 
 I'm not bringing this on the plane with us. 
 Yeah, you are. 
 It's not gonna fit in the overhead. 
 It'll fit. 
 I'll buy you a new piece of scrap metal when we get there. 
 Babe, this is "impor-ant." 
 Okay. So is the "T" in the middle of that word. 
 Okay. 
 Does he not know what that is? 
 No, he doesn't. And we're gonna keep it that way. 
 You know that's half mine. 
 I could really use the money right now. 
 It's too hot to sell right now. 
 Still? 
 Yes. Oh, hey. But if you want to sell something, why don't you sell Nate's clothes? 
 No, no, no, no, no. We already called dibs. 
 That's not how moving works, guy. 
 Uh, um, uh, Amber, listen. 
 Y-you're-you're great. It's just... 
 No, I... I don't need the speech. 
 I could tell I wasn't really your type. 
 No, it's just... 
 It's okay to admit you're not really into girls like me. 
 What's that mean? 
 You know... 
 She means rednecks, dummy. 
 You're not into rednecks. Okay, that's not what I meant. 
 And neither am I. 
 New York is going to do us a world of good. 
 I cannot wait to get out of here. 
 It offer diversity, education, culture. 
 That's just the speech that Dad gave us. 
 You got your culture. You got your education. 
 And the diversity? I mean, come on. 
 This guy's gonna get so much diversity. 
 I know. He's gonna love it. 
 You guys talking about New York? Huh? 
 Yep!

 What about you, fly boy? 
 ♪ Hey, I think I love you ♪ 
♪ So what am I so afraid of? ♪ 
♪ Afraid that I'm not sure of... ♪ 
 Is he okay? 
 Oh, uh, name's Jareb. 
 With a "B." 
 As in "boy" or "bras" or "bet you're wearing." 
 I'm wearing a bra too. 
 It's got ducks on it. 
 Uh, for her boobs... she wears a bra. 
 You guys aren't around people much, are you? 
 Boobs. They d... they, well, they... 
 They just stay put. 
 God, that's tight. 
 How do people do this in this city? 
 Nate, I think we made a mistake moving here. 
 No. Not the time for this conversation. 
 We don't have a place to stay. 
 Let's just pack up all of our stuff and go home. 
 I mean, I'm sure our trailer's still available. 
 And the kids start school in two weeks. 
 Let's just treat it like another shitty vacation. 
 And what, then? I commute 10 hours a day? 
 Was that bad? 
 It's fine. 
 [Horn Honking] 
 Okay, relax. Where's the fire? 
 [Siren Wailing] 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 I think it's, like, that way. 
 You just need an ice breaker. 
 Like a compliment? 
 Imagine something your dad said to your mom on their wedding day. 
 Oh, they're not married. 
 She's married to some other fat guy named Carlos. 
 Your dad's got to say something romantic to get a pretty woman like your mom. 
 What would he say? 
 Hey, you want to [Bleep] and order a pizza? 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Laughs Nervously] 
 Yeah, I get it. 
 I love this guy. 
 Well, I love you too, s... yeah. 
 [Horn Honking] 
 Firefighter : Move your vehicle! Now! 
 I'm trying to. I'm just a little stuck here. 
 People are dying because you can't parallel park! 
 Teenagers can parallel park better than you. 
 Girl teenagers. 
 In Saudi Arabia. 
 What? 
 Because women aren't allowed to drive there. It's sexist. 
 Ma'am, move now! 
 God, this guy is being such an asshole. 
 What'd you call me? 
 He called you an asshole. 
 Boys, this guy thinks we're a bunch of assholes! 
 Oh, I love you guys. You're awesome. You're heroes. 
 Why don't you just drive around the block so we can go save a few lives? 
 Yeah. Or I'll just back it in. 
 I'll just get it in. I-I will get it in. 
 I promise. 
 Lest we forget, I got this! 
 Come on, woman, give it some gas! 
 I got it! 
 Boys. 
 [Groans] 
 ♪ Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get parked! ♪ 
 Right? 
 Yeah. 
 So, if we're not going home, what are we gonna do? 
 We're just gonna sleep in the truck? 
 We just need some time to think, all right? 
 Please. Everyone needs to cool off. 
 Chase! Let's go. 
 Yeah, come on, kids. Get away from those squatters. 
 Excuse me? 
 What part of that is cooling off? 
 Say it again, woman. I dare you. 
 Everything okay, Harris? 
 No, not really. 
 Poppin' Fresh here threatening to evict us. 
 Sorry, Poppin' Fresh? 
 [Giggles] 
 Violence is not the answer, sir. 
 No one said it was. 
 Nate, we have a contract. 
 Goon up. 
 She's aggressive, but right. 
 Okay? It is a legal contract that we have, and we are entitled to this place. 
 Well, legally they have the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on their side. 
 Heard of it? 
 I have. 
 They didn't land on 125th street. 
 125th Street landed on them. 
 This is 153rd Street. 
 And we don't need you to talk for us. 
 We can speak for ourselves, Lars. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 In this relay for racial justice, it's my turn to carry the baton. 
 This isn't a black and white thing. 
 It's an asshole/not asshole thing. 
 No, it's... it's not. We don't really need you fanning the flames of a non-existent fire, okay? 
 Oh, so it's not the color of their skin your resent. 
 It's the content of their wallet. 
 I'm a podiatrist. 
 No, no, no. I know you make a fair wage. 
 It's just that I read an article in the  Times  that says it's distinction without difference. 
 Octothorp woke. 
 Get your own opinions. 
 Why do you go silent at times like these? 
 It's uncomfortable. 
 You started it. 
 [Laughs Nervously] 
 I, uh, I don't really know what to do here. 
 All I got to tell you is that this is our property, and we're not going anywhere. 
 That's a classic squatter play. 
 That... 
 Excuse me? 
 Go back to being silent! 
 Say it one more time, Frosty. 
 As in the snowman? 
 Offensive, isn't it? 
 Not really. He was a jolly, happy soul. 
 Well, how would you feel if we called you a crackah? 
 "We?" 
 Did you say crackah? 
 Word. Lars, please. Just stay out of it. 
 Nate : Everybody just needs to calm down! 
 No, no. This is my fight. You rest up for the battle. 
 There's no fight. 
 No, th-th... 
 There's not a lot of mean names to call white people. 
 What about snowflake? 
 They're beautiful and unique. 
 Casper? 
 The ghost who can't scare anyone? 
 What about bird turd? 
 [Laughs] Nice one. 
 Why are you his friend and not mine? 
 [Stomping] 
 Juice? 
 Yeah, I'll drink your juice. 
 Oh, we didn't start the fire. It's always been that way. 
 I-I... she might want some. 
 Kick his ass, Harris. 
 No. No one's fighting here. 
 What, you saying I can't take you? 
 Well, yes. But that's not why I'm saying it. 
 Whoa, what the hell is going on here? 
 We have squatters. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 You can't call them that. 
 I didn't. 
 You know how offensive that is? And I should know. 
 [Voice Breaking] We used to be just like them. 
 Excuse me? 
 The Irish. 
 Back in the day. We were the blacks. 
 Mm, no really. 
 Yes. Really. 
 Where do you think the expression "Black Irish" came from? 
 Their hair color. 
 That's why I got this "no Irish need apply" tattoo. 
 Why would you put it on your back? 
 So every day, when I look in the mirror... 
 It'd be backwards. 
 I'd be reminded of just how far we've come as a people. 
 Just like them. 
 You're one of the good ones, Doc. 
 Then why did you rent our apartment to them? 
 I told you we weren't moving. 
 I know. That's why they're in 5D. 
 What's the problem? 
 No. That's 5B. 
 No, see, that's a "D." 
 That's a "B." 
 Nah. 
 Mm. 
 Well, yeah maybe. I see that. 
 But it's supposed to be a "D," so... 
 You almost incited a race war by standing there and saying "B as in bagel." 
 I said "D as in dagel." 
 Dagel's not a word. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Use it in a sentence. 
 Come here, Dagel! Come on, Dagel! 
 [Dagel Barking] 
 What the hell is that? 
 Dagel. He's my dog. 
 Why didn't you say "D as in dog"? 
 Why did you assume I said "B as in bagel"? 
 Because I'm half Jewish? 
 Because I got a little oppression on that side too, you know. 
 [Sighs] 
 I, uh...[Laughs Nervously] 
 I think we'll all be pretty good friends. 
 I don't. 
 Hey, uh, you want this? 
 It's pretty nasty, but I don't want her to know. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 What did he say? 
 He don't like the juice. 
 Huh? 
 Wha? 
 The juice. 
 Sorry, what? 
 Juice! 
 What about them? 
 The boy hates the juice! 
 No, he doesn't hate... 
 Um... 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 No, that's not what you should be hearing. 
 Then why you destroy our car? 
 I didn't know it was a Jewish car. 
 And what does a Jewish car even look like? 
 You know, maybe New York is not for you guys. 
 See? 
 [Dance Music Playing] 
 This is so awesome. 
 You can see into everyone's apartment. 
 I'm gonna be friends with that guy. 
 Hey, guys, I know today wasn't the smoothest journey getting here, 'cause, you know, we're just not good on the road, but when we get places, we're great, right? 
 Yeah. Let's check out more windows. 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah? Right? 
 No! No! 
 What is wrong? 
 It was the bus company. My bag's gone. 
 Oh, my God. Why is that hunk of metal all of a sudden the most important thing in the world to you? 
 It's a piece of art, Nate, that my dad gave me before he walked out on us. 
 It's just a part of my past I'm not ready to let go of yet. 
 Okay, I'm sorry. I get it. 
 But they're gonna find it. You said it yourself. 
 Good things happen to good people. 
 And who's better than us? 
 Nobody. 
 I wasn't a good person when I lived here. 
 Oh, my God. Did you murder someone when you lived here? 
 No. No. 
 No. 
 You're a great person now. 
 And together, we're undefeatable. 
 Excuse me. 
 Buenas noches. 
 Was this woman on your bus? 
 I don't think she ever got on. 
 But she left her bag. 
 Hey! You know her? 
 Yes, I do, amigo!
