 Okay, let's recap. 
 Oh, we're recapping? Is that what we're doing? 
 Yep. 
 No sh1t. That's all we've been doing for the last two hours. 
 And the only thing you need to know is that my kids were deathly ill... is that because you force-fed 'em oysters at a landlocked roadside restaurant? 
 Why are you so interested in all this? 
 It's not just me. You've got everybody's attention.

 [Murmuring] 
 We can't put 'em in that vomit comet for the next eight hours. 
 It's just food poisoning. It'll pass. 
 Why are there no hotel rooms here? 
 We're not staying in a hotel... 
 Mr. and Mrs. Parker! Wait. 
 Now y'all forgot two very important but medically necessary items. 
 [Laughs] Aw. 
 Oh. Lollies. Thank you. 
 That's so sweet. 
 Southern hospitality. 
 Yes, ma'am? 
 Let's go. 
 Um, do you know why there are no hotel rooms available in this area? 
 The azaleas are blossomin', and the people have come to bear witness. 
 Now that said, I happen to know of a very nice B&B just a couple towns over. 
 Yeah, we're not B&B people. Thanks. 
 Well, now are you sure? 
 Let's go. 
 It's got a lot of character. 
 Yeah, that's code for "bedbugs." 
 Well, now I know the owner, and I guarantee he's gonna make y'all feel like royalty. 
 Is it you? 
 It is. 
 Aw. 
 It is indeed. [Laughs] 
 Well, the owner's gonna have a  little  extra vacancy tonight. 
 [Singsongy] Bye-ee! 
 What is your problem? 
 I'm sorry I'm not as charmed by all the southern hospitality B.S. as you are. 
 Whoa! 
 [Brakes screech] 
 [Chuckles] Well... He's back. 
 Look at me, pulling my own little Tiananmen Square here. 
 Last pitch... white horses, comfy beds for the kids to rest in, and Dr. Rob's very own sippin' vodka. 
 Y'all think it over, won't you? 
 We will. Thank you. 
 Who the hell drinks vodka? 
 Come on. We should at least take a look at it.

 [Chuckles] Yeah? Where'd you keep the slaves? 
 Honey. 
 What? 
 No, no, Robin. He's absolutely right. 
 They were housed down in the basement... 
 See? 
 To rest up for their journey north on the underground rail road.

 I can't.

 I said no.

 You believe in heavenly spirits, Robin? 
 Oh. I really...

 Oh.

 Oh. [Chuckles] 
 What would make Robin happy on this perfect spring day? 
 Me? 
 Mm. 
 Oh, I don't know. Been a long time since anyone's asked me that. 
 [Chuckles] Well, I'm askin'. 
 Okay, then what would make me happy is to know that  you're  happy... 
 Oh. 
 To know that you could find love again. 
 Oh. Don't you worry. I have. 
 Oh. I snagged me a beautiful young fiancée.

 I honestly cannot say enough about her. 
 If you love her this much, you should marry her. 
 [Sighs] I would if I could. 
 Sadly, it's been difficult finding anyone willing to officiate. 
 Why? 
 Well, for starters, she's Jewish. 
 Are you kidding me? Because she's Jewish? 
 Well... 
 What is wrong with the south? 
 And with her visa expiring and whatnot... 
 I'm actually in danger of losing her...

 Yes, there are many common interests leading to a love match... no smoking, no public beatings, no sh1t bed.

 Thought I had some time before this conversation. 
 Is it when you wanna know a person and talk to the person and just... just know everything about the person? 
 Yeah. Sure, that... that's part of it, yeah. 
 And you just wanna smell them and just crawl through the mirror and just help them comb their hair? 
 You have friends at school, right, pal? 
 Yeah, just... It feels really good inside. 
 Like... like,  really  good. 
 Feels great. I know it. 
 And it's perfectly natural. 
 Just... One thing to keep in mind is we shouldn't do it all the time. 
 But it's all I can think about. 
 Trust me. [Chuckles] 
 Sometimes I'm there with you, pal, like six, seven, eight times a day. 
 I just wanna tell the whole world. 
 No. Not a good idea. No. Do it, enjoy it, but let's keep it private.

It is night. Okay, so I think that Nate has probably given you the wrong impression. He's married, and in America... Yeah, I know about marriages in America. All the time worrying, "does he love me? Do I love him?" Is a waste of time. Love is luxury, and marriage is a business transaction. Okay? Well, that sounds like a horrible way to live. Only if you have horrible product to sell.
