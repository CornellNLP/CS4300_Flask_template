 Narrator : Hierarchy. 
 Often within a group of three or more, organization is difficult unless there is a leader. 
 Hierarchy is a ranking of authority. 
 Often when one member of the group is older, stronger, or more experienced, they will naturally assume the role of the protector at the top of the hierarchy. 
 But what happens when someone at the bottom of the hierarchy wants to be on top? 
 That is where our story begins. [Panting] All right, boys! Let's take a breather up ahead. [Panting] Whoo-hoo! Oh, yeah! Nice job, bros. Making good time. Woop. A little sweaty there, Panpan. How much farther do we have to go, Grizz? We've been jogging for a while now. Sorry, little bro! It's my job to keep this family in tip-top shape. I take my duties as the oldest brother very seriously. Well, sure, but do you think we can finish soon? I've been meaning to go to the mall, and the day's almost over. Sorry, buddy! We got to do at least 10 more miles. Ice Bear could go for 100. But, Grizz! No buts! Tally-ho! Move those feet! Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! [Spits] Blegh! Blagh! Over that rock! Blegh! Blagh! Watch out for branches! Hey! Got to stay hydrated! Hawk! [Hawk screeches] Ow! Faster, faster! Go, go, go! [Panting] Okay, bros! Five-minute break over. Now that we've warmed up, it's time to climb that giant tree over there. No, thanks. I'm gonna sit this one out. What?! Ehh. All right. Well, just stay here on this log, buddy. Keep yourself hydrated. Don't talk to strangers. And if you encounter any dangerous wild animals, just call for help. Love you! Hmph. No reception up here. Figures. [Rustling] Huh? Wha... Hey, man! Aah! Charlie? What are you doing here? Well, I was washing my feet in a puddle when I heard some loud, motivating screaming coming from this direction, so I thought i'd come check it out! But who cares? So how's it going buddy? You're looking a little bummed. Tell me about it. Ugh, it's just Grizz. He's being all bossy and stuff. Oh, come on, you bitter boy! He's just trying to look out for his little Panpan. I can take care of myself. What? You're really lucky to have an older bro to look after you. Sometimes I really wish I had one. He'd be like 10 feet tall! [Chuckles] Grizzly : Whoo-hoo! Man, that rock, you know. Just didn't see it coming. Oh, hey, Charlie! What are you doing here? Well, I was washing my feet in a puddle when I heard some loud ... [howling] What was that? Oh, man. I've heard rumors of weird things happening in this forest. Dangerous animals, hunters, raves. Oh, come on, guys. A lot of that stuff is in your head. What about those tracks over there? Ah, pfft. Nah. Those could easily be raccoon prints. W-W-What about those scratch marks over there? Ah, bunny scratches, most likely. Ice Bear sees bunnies. [Snarling, growling] Aah! [Whimpering] Don't worry, guys. I have this under control. Um, okay, guys, give me your wallets. Here you go. [Sniffs] [Growling] [Laughs nervously] Well, sorry about our lack of cash, but may we invite you guys over to our place for some chips and guac? Aah! Okay! No guac! Aah! Aah! Oh! Oh! Maybe we can work out a payment plan! Panda : Aah! Aaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Ugh. Oh, my gosh! Panda! You brave soul, that was incredible! You drove those wolves away like it was nothing! Mwah! W-W-Wha? Uh, how did you ... Ice Bear owes you big. That was a stroke of genius! Making yourself larger and more intimidating! Show Ice Bear how to do that. You're a marvel, champ! You really saved the day. Oh, thanks, guys. [Chuckles] I-I guess I did. [Chuckles] All right. I think it's time to get going. You know, that was enough excitement for one day, right? [Laughs] Sure. Okay! Uh, let's, um... Huh. Uh, wait... Troubles? Uh, yeah, I guess we got a little turned around back there. I'm not really sure where we are. Panda, are you GPS'ing? Look at this guy ... so prepared. Panda : Huh. I'm not getting a signal, though. Well, that's easy enough to fix. We'll just move you here... and move you here. 
 
 [Bird screeches, chirping] Whoa! It's beautiful up here! [Cellphone beeps] Hey, I got a signal! It's that way! Great! Brothers, forward! Uh, yeah, that's what I said. Uh, yeah. Hey, bears! You forgot your water bag! [Slurps] Good morning, brothers! [Yawns] So, I was thinking about what we were gonna do today and ... Hey, you made coffee without me? Yeah, I didn't want to wake you. You looked so cute and cozy in your bed. Uh, okay. So, about today... Yeah! I was thinking about us going to the mall. You know, do some shopping. But, uh, I was thinking ... Ice Bear can get new sushi knife. Great. It's decided. Wait, what just happened? Huh? Uhhh... Well, hop to it! Uh, this is so weird. Hey! To the mall!

It wasn't that bad. Grizzly : Yes, it was! Everyone was laughing at me and making fun of me in Korean! Grizz, that's enough. Open up! Hmm. Let's give him some space. You know, it's getting kind of late. I think it's time to head to bed, little bro. Ice Bear doesn't need beauty sleep. Ah-dat-dat-dat. Big bro knows best. There you go, nice and cozy. Oh, I almost forgot! [Humming] ♪ move your body to the music ♪ [Slurps] Oh, hello, handsome! Nothing can stop you, you magnificent fool. Gee, thanks! Aah! Hey, Panda! Don't mind me. Just came to see the show. Wait, what show? Ah, you know, the thing. I heard from a squirrel that told an owl that the wolves are coming by the crib and that they're bringing their whole crew. A rumble! It's gonna be good! Wait, what?! Yeah, man, I heard they're bringing their alpha. So it'll be you against him and their whole wolf pack, too. No! Charlie, y-y-y-you don't understand! I can't fight them. I'm a fraud! What are you talking about, big guy? It was all a big mistake! I didn't really ... I got freaked out, and it was just this big accident and ... oh! Wait a minute. Accident? Mm-hmm. Ooh. Ah. Aah! Oh, man. Whoa, a brick! I'm gonna go get your brothers. No! They can't find out! I got to start acting like an older brother. [music] [Growling] [Gasps] [Howling] [Growling] [Whimpering] Hey, I got a backup plan. Oh, great idea! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aaaah! Ha, it's working! You really showed those flea biters who's boss. [Growling] Oh, no, Charlie. What do we do now? Oh, boy. [Growling] [Whimpers] Wha... Hey! Ice Bear to the rescue. [Laughs] [Howls] Uh... [clatter] Oh! Charlie, great idea! Get that trash can over here! Oh, yeah, okay. Take that! [Growls, howls] Charlie, we need more stuff to stand on! I'm on it!

I just wanted ... No, man, this is my bad. You're the glue that keeps us together. I can't take that for granted. From now on, we'll be fair about everything. Thanks, man. Ice Bear wants to be top bear now. Uh, okay. [Both shivering] I think Grizz should be on top.
