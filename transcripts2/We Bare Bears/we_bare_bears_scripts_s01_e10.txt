♪ we'll be there ♪ [Classical music] [Whirring] [Sips] [Yawns] Ooh! Dude! There's a new Nom Nom video! Isn't that the koala who threw you out of his limo? That guy's a butt. Well, yeah, I don't like him personally, but I still like his videos. Just watch. Ewww! Ba-ba-ba-ba-boo. [Laughter] So cute, right? Yeah, actually that wasn't bad. [Sniffs] What's that one on the side there? Uh, hmm, I don't know. Let's see. "Epic blow-up"? Good morning, internet. Have I got the scoop for you. Internet superstar Nom Nom blows up at fans when a book signing gets a little out of hand. Boom! That should do it! You're welcome! Oh, my gosh! Geez. Looks like our favorite koala isn't quite as cute as we thought he was. Well, I don't even think I need to explain myself. I was totally in the right and ... [man coughs] Wait, who laughed? Who's laughing at me! Are you laughing at me?! Nom Nom, no one's ... All right, that's it. Get this stupid thing off me! This response video went up on Nom Nom's channel just last night. I keep hearing the word diva thrown around, but that's just not true. I've got responsibilities like everyone else. Oh! Looks like it's time to feed my pets. [Beep] Good doggie. Marie : I think it's clear that our favorite marsupial's career... Grrrrrr. Go away! ...is all washed up. That's it for today. Don't forget to like, comment, favorite ... Ugh, enough. This is terrible. Poor guy, he just wanted to make great art. The pitfalls of being a creative genius. [Knock on door] Oh! That's probably the thing I ordered. It's this really coo RC helicopter and it flies really high and has little blinky lights ... [Hiccups] [Sniffs] Hey, was it my package? Where is it? It's rude to shut the door on the mailman, you... kno-o-o-w! Um, hey, friend. Do ... Do you remember me? [Gasp] Oh, my gosh, it's Nom Nom! What's he doing here? I was, uh... you know, just in the area and I thought, hey, why not stop by and say hi since all my other friends are gone. And my job, and one minute you've got it all... and what am I now? [Sobbing] Oh, you poor little cabbage. You should just stay with us, man! We got plenty of room. Are you sure that's a good idea? This guy's a butt, remember? Ice Bear hates butts. Nom Nom : No, no, you guys are right. I wouldn't let me in, either. I mean, who would want a [hiccups] giant loser in their house?! [Sobbing] Come on in, buddy. Let's get you fixed up. [Sniffles] Grizzly : How are you, man? You holding up? I was just trying to make people laugh. Why, world?! What has Nom Nom ever done to you? [Clears throat] You can just set those down right there, yep. [Crying] Aw, it's probably not as bad as you think, buddy. No, no, you don't get it. I'm alone in this world. No one will ever make videos with me anymore. [Slurps] Don't say that. You just need a new angle. Show people a different side of yourself. The good side. Do you really think that could work? But my crew's all gone. I don't know how to make videos without them. Psht! You don't need that old crew. You've got us! Right, bros? Uh, yeah. Ice Bear wants no part of this. Ooh! What if we did something fresh? What if... I dunno... we made a movie? Yes, I see it! You, you can be our director. [Inhales] It would be an honor. Nom Nom : And, you, you can be my social media guy. What? That's not very exciting. Nom Nom : Yeah, you know what? You're right. Most of my fanbase is just girls anyway, I'm in! so I guess ... Nom Nom : Great! And, you... Oh, there he goes. Ah, don't worry about him. We can do this movie with just us. All right, let's do this. Let's make this movie! Oh, this is going to be amazing. Let's make a movie! ♪ Come and feel me ♪ [Music] ♪ I like where this is going ♪ 
♪ This old man named Tony ♪ 
♪ Well, he's a bad, bad man ♪ 
♪ And he taught me how to twist ♪ 
♪ Like I'm in the quicksand, yeah ♪ 
♪ Can you feel me ♪ 
♪ Ain't no thang what I've been doing ♪ 
♪ Shoop, shoop ♪ 
♪ Just waving my arms like this ♪ 
♪ Shoop, shoop ♪

 Nom Nom : You boys are in for a treat. I've really outdone myself. Mmm. Oh, delicious. Mm. You have such a talent. Grizzly : Make this for us every night. Oh, hey, uh, can somebody get me ketchup? I mean, it's great and everything, I just like ketchup. [Laughs] [Both grunting] [Squeaks] [Both gasp] Why, brother? Oh, no! Nom Nom! Poor little guy! Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. It's okay. Shh. Shh. Shh. How could you do that? How could you hurt anything that cute? You're a monster! [Ting!] [Rattle] [Door opens] [Door creaks] [Plastic crinkles] [Door opens] Nom Nom : Listen, I know things look bad right now, but I can turn it around! I got these dumbos right where I want them, Oh, yeah?! You don't believe me? You just wait until tomorrow and you'll be begging to join my crew again! Well, let ... [clank] Let me call you back. There's still one thing I need to take care of. [Door opens] Grizzly : Ah, I'm so excited! Our first day of filming! Panda : I hope it becomes a cult classic. Ice Bear ... [clears throat] Ice Bear is down here. Wait, did you hear something? Nom Nom : I didn't hear anything. We should get going. [Indistinct conversations] Well, here we are! Welcome to the movie set, boys! And everyone you see here is an extra in the movie! Wow. Uh, where are the cameras? Oh, they're hidden everywhere. It'll help with your acting! Wait, what? We're acting? Oh, we get to be in the movie? Oops, did I forget to mention that? Both : Ooh! Hey, Nom Nom, um, could we rehearse our lines first? Uh, no time! Quick! Take your marks in the pool! And remember, your characters are in distress. Here's your costumes and props. Put 'em on and get in your places. Thanks, man. We won't let you down. All right, go get 'em. Aw, man. Why is the slide closed? Scram! Go swim in chlorine with your eyes open. [Vehicle approaching] Man : Mailman! I have a package for a Grizzly bear? Hello? Anybody here? Whoa! Oh, my! Package for Grizzly bear? Here, let me. Oop. Okay, then. Ooh! [Feedback] Okay, guys, ready and action! Save me! Oh, no! Oh, no, the water is drowning us. Attention, everyone! Can you all focus your attention on the drowning bears, please. I am drowning! Water filling up my tummy. Eh. [Phone chimes, clicking] Flawless. And now to raise the stakes. [Beep] Man : Whoa. What's that! It's a shark. All : Run! Run! [All screaming] Everyone's playing their part so well. Those bears are still in the water. [Chuckles] Oh, look, everyone, it's Nom Nom! [Music] Why are all the extras out of the pool? Is that special effects? Uh, that felt real. [Both screaming] OMG, it's a shark! [Chuckles] Nom Nom is saving them! Man : He's a hero! Bears! Remain calm. Nom Nom, get out of the pool, man. There's real sharks here! What are you doing? Stop! [Beep] All : Help! Eat them first! I'm small and bony! Oh my God! Whoa, what's that? [Helicopter blades whirring] Huh? [Triumphant music plays] [Sharks roaring] No, no, no! You ruined my video! This was my shot! Let me down! Aaaah! Waaaagh. Huh? [Screams] Hey, look, it's Nom Nom and he's being adorable! [Crowd "aww"s] Woman : Nom Nom. He's adorable. Woman 2 : Nom, Nom, Nom, Nom, Nom, Nom, Nom. [Crowd murmuring] Well, looks like Nom Nom is back where he belongs ... on the internet. Bummer we didn't get to be in that movie, though. Yeah, but at least we weren't eaten alive by sharks. [Laughs] True that. Uh... ketchup? [Chomps]
