[Grunts] Whoo! Sweet catch, bro. So, you guys playing a game? Um... yeah? Hey, you guys got room for one more player? Uh, sorry, man. We've already got, like, four, so... no? Hey, no sweat, guys. I'll just pop a squat here and watch. Don't mind me. Carry on. Whoo! Nice form, bro! Hey, good one. [Laughs] Hmm. Tacos or burgs? Um, yes. A black bear? What?! This quiz is completely stupid. Justice delivered. Ooh, hello, beautiful. Yum... where? Let's see what we got here. Mm-hmm. [Distant conversation] [Chuckles] I like that. [Chuckles] What?! Oh, that's just creepy. No. No, not that either. Hmm. [Keyboard clacking] Huh? [Squeaks] Aah! Intruder! [Thumping] [Vacuum whirring] [Thumps] Nice hustle. Oh! Good one. Yeah, you guys are on fire! Aw, great. Now what are we gonna do? [Panting] Hold tight, amigos. I got it. [Grunts] Almost. Hold on. Uh, whoa. Whoa! Oom! Ha, ha! Got you, you sneak. Hey, guys, look! Cool. Just toss it down, man. Yeah, coming right at you, buddy. Oh. [Groans] Okay, here it comes. Nice throw. Uh, hey, why don't you play with us? Really? Yes. All right, cool. I'll be right down. [Grunts] Huh? Hey, what's going on? [Creaking] [Grunts] Tree dude, you okay? Uh, yeah. All good up here. Just, uh, enjoying the view. You guys go ahead. I'm just gonna hang here a little bit longer. All right, well, whenever you want to come join us. Yeah, okay. See you soon. Come on, leg. Get it together, man. Um, hey there, little guy. [Squeaks] Aah! Wait, what are you doing? [Pings] What? No! I don't hate babies! What? Please, please! You don't understand! No! No! No! No! No! Noooo! [Vacuum whirring] [Banging] [Sizzles] [Rattles] Grizzly : [grunting] Come on, leg. Work with me. [Grunts] Oh, hello, friend. Hurry. Fly away and get me an axe, or maybe butter. Maybe both. [Blows] That's it. You can do it. I believe in ... [gasps] Hey, you need any help up there? Nah, brah. Just chilling. Uh, hey, why not throw that thing up here? Uh, okay. Whoa. Almost there. Can you throw it higher? Oh, sorry. My bad. So close there, man. Panda : Hey, guy. Uh, what's happening, um, over there. [Chuckles] Just typing away, huh? Here, little guy. Just, uh, just turn around. [Gasps] There we go. J-Just a gentle ride. Oh, wow. This is so much fun. Oh, no, no, no. Stop looking at me. [Squeaks] Aah! [Squeaks] Ow! No. [Exhales] [Whirring] [Boing!] [Boing!] [Grunting] Ha! I got it. Cool. Now throw it back down. Okay, but you better back up. Whoa! [All gasp] [Laughs] Yeah. Ah! This is exactly what I wanted. Much more comfortable. 
 
 Whoa, are you all right? What's happening? Whoa, is he in trouble? Is he protesting? Oh, I got it. [Panting] [Grunts] Sorry, could you clean that? Here you go. Some nice, bland animal-ish crackers. Yes. Yes, that's right. Into the bag. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hmm! Man : Who is that up there? Everyone, please. I'm fine. Nothing to see here. [Siren chirps] Now please go away. What's going on? Is that guy stuck? Not stuck. Phew. That should do it. [Chuckles] [Mouse clicking] Huh? No! Stop! No, not that one! No. Stop it! [Pinging] [in slow-motion] Noooo! [Grunts] [Groans] Aah! My contacts! Oh. Oh. [Groans] [Whirring] [Whirring intensifies] [Screeches] [Beeping] [Whirring] [People screaming] Man : Get it away from me! We're reporting live at the scene where a bear is seemingly stuck in a tree. This may be the most stuck bear we've seen in years, and he shows no signs of getting unstuck anytime soon. I'm not stuck! Everyone please go home. Don't worry. We'll get you down. Just grab my hand and you'll be okay. I said I wasn't stuck. There's nothing to worry about. Go away! No! Huh? [People screaming] No, no, no! Help me! Help me, please! Whoa! Aah! Phew. Wha?! Aah! Come on! Come on! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Wha. [Grunts] [Gasps] I'm alive. Huh? [Rustling] [Beeping] Whaah! [Whimpering] [People screaming] [Whimpering] Go away! Shoo! Shoo! Oh, help, please! I need help! Heeelp! Whaah! [Whimpers] Aaaah! [Rumbling] Aah! Whoa! That actually hurt less than I thought it would. Hmm? Uh, I found your contacts. Oh, my gosh! Give them to me! Oh, delete! Delete! Delete! Delete! Oh, come on, come on, come on. [Sighs] Phew. Don't worry, son! We'll get you out of there. Just grab my hand and you'll be okay. Grab my hand! Go away. Do not worry. I'm not worried. Just go. [Squeaks] Don't worry, sir. I got you. Someone get me a small stretcher! [Claps] [Thumps] [Whirring] [Thumps] [Claps] [Whirring] [Doors closing] [Clatter]
