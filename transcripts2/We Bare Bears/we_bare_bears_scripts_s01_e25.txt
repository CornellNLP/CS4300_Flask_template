 [Soft jazz playing] 
 [Panting] 
 [Humming] 
 [Giggling] 
 Oh! 
 [Humming] 
 Hmm. 
 Guys, come here! You gotta see this! 
 What's up? 
 Check out this book. 
 It says that pandas have a special lining in their throats to protect them from bamboo splinters! 
 Ice Bear finds that fascinating. 
 I know, right?! Pandas are so interesting! 
 Ice bears can swim up to 100 miles at a time. 
 Cool. Oh, and in the wild, pandas eat for 12 hours a day! 
 Uh, you know, I'm gonna find a book, too ... with cool, awesome facts about grizzlies. 
 Wow, I was all white when I was born! 
 Ice Bears wash ourselves with snow instead of water. 
 Hmm, goats. Great horned owls, gray squirrels. 
 Oh! Grizzly! Come to me. 
 "Goodnight Grizzly." 
 Oh, hello, little guy. 
 "Grizzly is brown." 
 Hey, guys, I found one that ... 
 Pandas have the largest molar teeth of any carnivore. 
 Uh, hey, uh, did you know that, um, grizzlies are brown? 
 Yeah. 
 Ice bears have rough paws to prevent slipping on ice. 
 [Sighs] I need more info, little bear. 
 [Gasps] Ice Bears can also ... 
 Well, can you guys do this?! 
 Hibernate? That's when animals sleep through Winter, right? 
 Uh-huh! 
 Hmm, looks like pandas don't hibernate. 
 Ice bears do. 
 Hmm. 
 Lady ice bears. 
 Ha ha! 
 So hibernation is just my thing. 
 [Laughs] It's like a holiday ... just for me. 
 Dude, don't you think you're a little too domesticated to hibernate? I mean, you've never slept through the Winter before, and you seem fine to me. 
 Wait ... what month is it!? 
 January. 
 Is that Winter? 
 Yes. 
 Ahh! I'm already so behind! 
 Grizz, you're not seriously going to sleep for five months?! 
 Jeez, I gotta start eating right now if I want to catch up! 
 I'll take this book and everything in here, please! 
 To go. 
 "Bear gathers food." 
 Whee! 
 "Bear eats." 
 Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! 
 [Munching] 
 Mmm, so good! You don't need all this, right? 
 [Munching] 
 Mmm! What's next?! 
 One for Miki-chan, and one for Panda. 
 Mmm! 
 Did you know that grizzlies like myself can gain up to four... 
 [Slurp] hundred pounds while preparing for hibernation? 
 [Video game sound effects] 
 Mmm! Fact ... did you know that grizzlies can... [Munching] travel hundreds of miles to find enough food to... [chomp] last them through the whole Winter? 
 Grizzlies are pretty amazing, right? 
 [Slurp] Huh?! The hunt continues! 
 [Game over sound effect] 
 All right, let's see how I'm doing. 
 Yep! Nice and full. What's next? 
 "Bear collects soft things for the den." 
 Soft things, eh? [Chuckles] 
 [Panda singing] # Ooh, sharing ice cream with a lady # 
 Huh? Oh, what is the... [Growls] All right, where's all my stuff?! Oof! What? Mr. Penguin? Oof! Panda, do you mind? I'm practicing here. But ... oh! But this is my stuff! You can't just take it! Sorry, man, but I need it! This is where I'll be sleeping all Winter! Pretty great, right? No, it's not! You can't just keep my stuff all Winter! And you're taking up the whole living room! Ice Bear has decided, not into hibernation. Well, I'm sorry if you don't like it, but there's nothing I can do about it! Oh, I read something on the internet ... did you know that when it's time for grizzly bear to hibernate, he releases hormones that allow him to ... Aw, come on, man! We don't want to hear about your hormones! This is ridiculous. I mean, you don't see us going nuts over what we can do. The world isn't ready for what Ice Bear can do. Come on, man. Let's just forget it and have a normal Winter. You know what I think? You guys are jealous ... and it is sad to see! I'll take my hibernation... [Grunts] elsewhere! Where are you going?! Some place far away from you nay-sayers! They tell me what to ... [grunts] Good night! Oh! [Slams] Perfect! [Panda laughing] 
 
 Yeah, can I have some?! They don't know what they're missing. All right, finally! Time for the easiest part. [Waves crashing softly] Ha-ha! Aah ... right on time! [Sighs] Well, good night, Miki-chan. I will see you in June! [Grunts] [Grumbling] [Grunting] I can't sleep! Get... [panting]  sleepy! [Panting] [Bird chirp, rain falling] [Hissing] Help me! Agh! Help me, Miki-chan. Ugh! Aw, bear, you make it look so easy! This just isn't working. Oh! Oh, I give up. I'm going back inside. [Voice] Wait, don't go! Hello? Oh. Get it together, Grizzly. That's the ticket! Whoa! There! Now, what's this I hear about giving up? You can't do that! You're a handsome upstanding Grizzly! Yep, that's right! Look at you! Uh... Come with me! I'll show you why hibernation's so important. Well, I tried everything, I guess. Well, here we are! Ah, look at me! I'm so charming! Whoa! No way! I'm in the book! [Laughs] [Grunts] [Laughing] Amazing! You want to see some more stuff? Yeah! Whoa! Whoa! Teleportation ... ha! I didn't realize this book was sci-fi. No, silly ... it's about you! And how special you are! Let me tell you a little something ... watch your step. Hibernation isn't something you should just brush off! We Grizzlies are very unique animals. Other bears... [Screams] they just don't get it! Yeah! They'd only make fun of me if I went back. Which is exactly why you've gotta get sleeping! Go ahead and pull that tab, you've earned it. Ooh! That will grow back. [Gasps] Oh, my gosh! What's all this?! Well, we gotta get ready for hibernation somehow! Eating a lot is definitely a requirement! Oh, that looks amazing! That's artisan stuff! Mmm! It is amazing ... not to mention delicious! And no one can tell you to stop! Anyone who does is just jealous of how much fun you're having! Whoo-hoo! Ha ha! It's a dream! Come along! Grizzlies get to enjoy all the best seasons! Fresh flowers in Spring, the crisp air in Fall, the awesome outdoor concerts in the Summer! And then we skip the yucky stuff! All righty, here we are! The perfect den! Oh!, awesome! This is great! I feel totally ready to sleep now! So... where's the end part? End part? What end part? You know, the part where I wake up and my bros are there and they're really happy to see me, and I'm happy to see them, even if we fight sometimes, but it's still great. And we party ... with little hats? Mmm, I don't know about that. This is the last page. No parties here! Just good old fashioned sleeping for good old-fashioned grizzlies. What? All right, this can't be it! What happens when I wake up! Oof! I have to see. [Grunts] [grunts] Huh? It's just blank. My brothers aren't here... what does it mean? Who cares! You don't need them. You've got so much other stuff ... food, a comfy den. If my brothers aren't here when I wake up, I don't want to go to sleep at all! I have to go back! Hmm? What? Go back? Ow! Grizzly, where do you think you're going? [Screams] You can't go back! Your brothers are going to laugh at you! No, they won't! [Screams] They probably don't even want you back! That's not true! I love my bros! I'd never leave them for good! Bros? Five months is a long time, man! Do you really think they'll stick around? Bros?! Which one are you? Don't you want to be special! [all speaking] Don't you want to be better than your brothers? Don't you want to be special? No! No, I don't! Oh. Okay. Huh? Whoa! [Panda] Grizz? Grizz, are you awake, bro? [Panting] Where is he?! [Screams] Where are you, you little bear?! It's okay, Grizz. You're awake now. It's okay, you're safe. Yeah, there is no little bear. Only large bears. Oh, what... what happened? We've been trying to wake you up, but you were, like, delirious! We even got a video, see? Oh, come here! Oh! [Laughing] [Screaming] You were surprisingly agile. Ice Bear wants to watch it again. [Both laugh] What was the matter, Grizz? Couldn't sleep? Uh, well, no, I ... I couldn't quite, um, uh... I mean, I tried, you know? Okay, man. We'll let you get back to it. No! I mean, um, what I mean is, um, I would just, ah, I was, uh... I was just gonna go outside for some fresh air. You want to come? Uh, yeah. O-Okay. It's a nice night tonight. [Sighs] Yeah. You know what? Being here with you guys is special enough for me.
