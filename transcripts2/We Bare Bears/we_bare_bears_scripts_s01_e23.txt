♪ take my hand, I exclaim ♪ [Speaking Korean] _ Morning, mom. I made you an extra sandwich. Oh, thank you Chloe. Don't worry about the dishes. Mm, I don't mind. So, what are you doing today? My friends are gonna come pick me up, and we're going to ... [Doorbell rings] Oh, they're here! Got to go now. Bye. Mom! Love you! Love you, too! Don't stay out too late! [Doorknob rattles] H... oh. Hey. Uh, where are your brothers? [Cellphone vibrates] Oh, it's from Grizz. A video? Chloe! Oh, I'm really sorry, but Pan and I can't make it today. We started this video game dungeon level, and if we don't finish now, we'll have to start the whole game over again. And I just don't think Panda can take it. Aaah! Grizz, get back here! I'm down to my last life heart, and I'm all out of faeries! Uh, got to run Chloe. We'll make it up to you, okay? You two have fun, though. I'm coming to save you, bro! Aaaaah! There's like 10 wizards! Looks like it's just you and me then, huh? Pardon me. All right, so, what were you thinking about doing today? Uh, what's that? [rustling paper] Ice Bear has errands. Hmm. That's a lot of errands. But what do you want to do today? Ice Bear already mentioned errands. [Chuckles] No, like fun stuff! You do fun stuff, right? Well, we're not doing chores for your brothers now. Today, we're gonna have fun. Nope, we're not doing those. You're gonna have a good time today, I promise. We just got to figure out what you... want to do. Come on. Psst. Hey. I made a list of all the places I want to take you. I got food, sightseeing. You're going to love all of these. [Chime sounds, Man on P.A.] Now arriving at Embarcadero. That's our stop. Let's go! [Sea lions squealing] Aww, look at them all! This is the best place to watch the sea lions. It's one of my favorite things to do, so I thought you'd like it. [Grunts] Ha! Did you see that! That was ... [Camera shutter clicks] Oh. [Camera shutter clicks] Sea lions not doing it for you, huh? [Distant grunting] I can't believe you've never done this. Crossing the bridge is like a rite of passage. So the whole trip there and back is three miles long, and it gives us the best view of the whole city. Come on! All right, feast your eyes on this incredible view! Oh. Are you hungry?! Ice Bear is bored. Hush, hush! You know, my dad takes me here all the time on weekends. The pastries are so good! The line can be long, but it's worth it, promise. Huh? No! We are waiting in this line, and you're gonna love it. Ah, look at all these! I'll take this one, this one, two of these. What are you gonna get? [Pigeon coos] [sighs] Man : What was it you wanted again, miss? Oh, nothing, actually. I changed my mind. Sorry. Look at this guy. He never, ever moves. Takes a lot of discipline. [Groans] Ice Bear is not impressed. [Sobs] Sorry. Oh, this store's cute. Want to go in here? Ice Bear has already read these. Um, you want to look at, uh, fridges? You like those, right? Ice Bear already has fridge. How about bikes? Wheels and stuff? Ice Bear is his own wheels. [Gasps] Wait! I got it! You're gonna love this! Stay right there! Cover your eyes! [Dog yelps] Okay. 
 
 [Horn honks] [Horns honking] [Panting] So fun! [Panting] Ice Bear knows CPR. Did... Did you have a good time? You did? I can't believe it! You actually had fun? The most fun you've ever had in your whole life? [Sighs] You didn't like it all, did you? [Groans] [Music] [Slurps] Some more hot water for you, sir? Anything else for you, sweetie? I'm fine, thank you. So, uh, do you like, uh... waffles? [Sighs] Ugh, think Chloe. What else can we do? [clatter] Huh? Hmm. Hmm. Sorry. Here's your hot water. [Slurps] Thanks again for the waffles. I guess we should just head home. I'm sorry we never found something fun for you. I-I really wanted you to ...  Huh? You okay? Oh, the museum!  Have you ever been? The rare albino alligator is amazing! [music] Uh, do you want to see the alligator? Come on, let's go. [Engine revs] [music] Hi, may we have two tickets to the museum, please? The museum closes in 20 minutes. Do you still want the tickets? Yes, please! And a map. Yes, and a map. Okay, here we are at the entrance. We just need to go through the aquarium to the planetarium, past the tide-pool touch tanks ... one of my personal faves. Don't worry, we'll see the alligator, I promise. Then we go through the animal hall to the albino alligator. Well, let's get going.  Come on! This is the moon jelly tube. Did you know that moon jellies can be found in every ocean? Look at that big one! This is the butterfly room. It has over 150 butterflies and 40 different species. Whoa, did you know the universe contains hundreds of billions of galaxies? In fact, a recent study estimated that ... Oh. Oh, okay. And this one's a decorator crab. [Grunts] They collect little pieces of kelp and sedentary ... Hmm? Oh, right! Come on, let's go. [Chime sounds] Woman on P.A. :  Attention guests, the museum will be closing in five minutes. What!  No! It can't close! We're so close!  Wait! Stop! They can't close if we all stay!  Wait! I told you we would see that alligator, and we're not leaving until we do. I think I have a plan. ♪ Da-di-ba-do-ba-bup-ba-de ♪ [snap] Who's there? ♪ da-de-da-di-da-de ♪ Okay, it's clear. Come on, this way. [music] Whoa! Oh! Hey, over there! You can see its tail! Why is he hiding? We just got to get his attention. Hey! Hello, alligator! Please come out! Ice Bear thinks it's time to go home... and hide. Like albino alligator. [Grunts] You are gonna see that alligator! Just wait here, okay? [Grunts] Chloe... Guard : Hello? Is someone there? Come on out. I have Panda's jelly sandwich for you. Hello? [Grunts] I know you prefer to eat ... Aah! Hello-o-o? What the...? Hmm, kids these days, wasting good sandwiches. [Sighs] [Growling] Huh? [Growling continues] Uh, did you hear that? [Growling continues] [Dramatic music plays] [Hisses] [Sniffs] [Sniffs] [Sniffs] [Chomps] [music] Come on, lets get out of here. Let's go. Hurry. Hey, I'm sorry for causing so much trouble. I just wanted you to have fun today. Mmm.  [Chomps] [Cellphone vibrates] Oh, uh, it's Grizz again. Hey, dudes! Hope you two had a good time today. Uh, but you kind of need to come home soon, lil bro. Panda had a, uh, a bad day. It was rigged! Uh, so, if you could pick us up, like, a new console on your way home, that would be great. Okay, bye. Love ... [cellphone vibrates] Oh, my mom will be here soon. [Both munching] Ice Bear enjoyed the sandwich.
