Your elbow's in my face! [Grunts] Both : Huh? Hey, guys! I'm free! [Clang!] Whoa! Ooof! [Notes play] Aww, man. That's all our money. [Thunder rumbles] [Groans] All right, maybe we should just head home. We're not having the best of luck. If only the world was ready for our music. [Wind howls] Ah! Our masterpiece! Ice Bear found comb. Huh? [Sparkle, twinkle] Guys, check it out. [Sparkle, Roar] Both : Whoa. Huh? Hey, it stopped. What is that thing? It's some kind of jacket... made of jeans. It's a pants-jacket! Whoa! It's all dirty and crusty. Maybe we should throw it back in the dumpster. Yeah, you're probably right. Hey, nice jean-jacket, bro! Sweet jacket! Yeah, man! Guys, did you see that? That was incredible! We can't throw this out. I haven't had a high-five in months. But with this jacket, I just got three in a row! Let me try it on. Whoa! Legal tender!

I might run into some girls at the coffee shop. How will I know what to say? [Clears throat] Ice Bear needs it for everyday hustling. Come on, man. That's not a good reason. [Thunder rumbles] Huh? The jacket! [Gasps] Cover it! Keep it safe! Ice Bear is getting wet. It'll be okay as long as the jacket is dry. Oop, we're inside. Here we are, Jacket.  Welcome home. Our lives are gonna be so great from now on. Panda : It's the best thing that's ever happened to us. Ah, I'm so glad we found this! [Smooches] Well, it's been a long, lucky day. I'm bushed! Hang on a minute!  Where are you going? Just uh... to my room.  With this jacket. That's not fair! We have to share it equally. You can't just hog it away in your room! Ice Bear needs to see proof of ownership. Well, I was technically the one who found it. So I'm pretty sure I get first dibs. No! It's all of ours! Okay, okay. Geez!  Here, I have an idea. Um... hmm.  Hmm. Mm... 
 
 Ah! Found it! Our decision-machine! Panda : Buh! I hate that thing. This little beaut will help us decide Who gets the jacket first, fair and square! Ice Bear highly doubts that. Let's give her a little spin-a-roo! [Laughs] Look at it go! I can't believe we're doing this. Ha ha! Whoo! Probability, am I right? Thanks! Hang on, Grizz! That wasn't fair, and you know it! Grizz! Come out of the bathroom! It's our jacket, too! Grizz? I'm coming in! [Clears throat]  It's time to pass the jacket now. You've had it long enough. But I'm not done with it! Fair is fair. Ugh, fine. [Sighs] [Sniffs] Okay, time's up. Aww, come on! No buts! [Groans] Here. [Gasps] Wait! Come back here! Aah! What are you doing?! Come back here! Hey, hey, hey, hey! We have to share! Oh! Oh! Get back here! Ha! Wait, what are you doing? Oof! Take off the jacket! No! It's mine! Give me the jacket! I look better in it! [Slap!] Aah! [Gasps] You guys, we're not wearing this jacket. This jacket is wearing us! We have to get rid of it.  Agreed? Frankly, I'm glad we chose to get rid of it, bros. Too much power can really mess someone up. Yeah, we don't need it. [Slurps] Ahh. I think I just burned my taste buds off. [Knock at door] Huh? Uh... hi, may I help you, sir? Yea, I have the three extra large, Double meaty pizzas you ordered. I didn't order pizza.... Uh... I dunno. They're free. Just take them. What? Really? Gee, thank you. No problem. Oh, hey, I found something on your front lawn. Is this your jacket? It's super-cool. [Jacket roars] [gasps] Here you go. Have a nice day. Um, it came back, you guys! It's like it's drawn to us. Jean jacket is mean jacket. Whatever we do, we can't give into ... [Grizz chomps] G-Grizz! What? You can't eat that. By eating that pizza, you're accepting this evil thing's gift. Aah! You're right. We've got to get rid of that thing. [Wind gusting] [Thunder crashes] It's a bunch of... dance class coupons? Ugh! Enough of this! Be gone! Phew! Wha...? [Cellphone vibrates] Huh? Stop it! No, stop it! [Sobbing] This jacket is haunting us. Guys, it's clear. We must return the jacket from whence it came. [Jacket roars] [Thunder crashing] [Wind gusting] [Music] Hey, free cupcakes! Special one time offer. They're completely free. We have to resist the siren songs of this evil jacket. Come on! [Thunder crashes] There it is. All right, guys. On three. One....  two....  three! [Wind gusting] [Thunder crashes] Grab it! [Panting]  Ow! [Slap!] [Shrieks] Aah! Aah! Aah-aah-aah! Aah-aah-aah! Grizz! The jacket. It ... It chose me. I must protect it. It wants me. It's mine. Grizz, no!  Remember what it did to us. You're right. I... [sighs] I can't think clearly. It's the jacket.  It won't release us. There's nothing we can do. No. There is something I can do. Forgive me, brothers. Wait! What're you doing?! I love you guys. No! Grizz, stop! Don't do it! [Birds chirping] [Wind gusts] At least his music will live on. [Crying] I miss him so much. [Grizz groans] Huh? [Grunts] Grizz! Grizz, we thought you were a goner. Ice Bear cried, but just inside. What happened in there? Doesn't matter. That jacket will never bother us again. Let's go home. Panda : Well, I'm just glad things will finally be back to normal. Grizzly : Me, too, guys. Me, too. [Horn honks] Get out of my way. [Air brakes hiss] [Ominous music playing] We're the best of friends, man. Nothing will ever come between us. Huh? Whoa, sweet jacket. [Jacket roars]
