 [Grunting] 
 Ooh, ohh, aah, aah. 
 Um, running? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 No, a plane! Oh, oh, a bird! 
 Yeah, yeah, but what kind of bird? 
 Hey, no talking! 
 Sorry. 
 Um, I don't know, man. 
 Pass. 
 Chloe : Time. 
 Dude, a penguin. I was a penguin. 
 Ballet. Uh... [Groans] 
 Robot! Uh, a rolling pin? 
 A line... A square. Telescope. 
 [Clicking] 
 Uh, typewriter. 
 Grizzly bear? Panda bear! 
 [Clicking] Uh, you're a typewriter! 
 Dude! 
 Boat. Pizza. 
 Statue of liberty. Snowman. 
 Whale. Spider monkey. 
 Richard Nixon. Old faithful. 
 "I know why the caged bird sings." 
 Time! 20 answers in 43 seconds! 
 No! 
 Yeah! Whoo-hoo! 
 We did pretty well, though. 
 ♪ She's my girl ♪ 
 No, we didn't. 
 What? 
 Hey, guys. Sorry, it's my dad. 
 Yuh bo se yo? Mm. Mm. Oh. 
 [beeps] What's going on? Do you need to go? 
 No, they're just checking in. No big. 
 Oh, man, this itch. 
 Here you go. 
 [Scratching] 
 [Moaning] 
 Ha! Yeah, much better. 
 Oh, thanks, Chloe. 
 My pleasure. 
 Hey, so, you guys ready for some bubble tea? 
 Yeah, bubble tea! 
 Losers buy! 
 [Slurps] 
 [Squirts] 
 [Laughs] Oh, yeah? You want a bubble fight? 
 Chloe? Hey, what's up? 
 It's Amy. We're in the same biochem class. 
 This is Chloe. You know, the prodigy girl at our school. 
 Oh, hey. 
 Uh, hi. 
 Hey, you should join our study group. 
 We meet every Wednesday after class. It'll be great. 
 Yeah, okay. Maybe. 
 Mm, I don't know if I can, though. 
 Oh, well, no pressure. 
 I-If you ever change your mind, give me a call. 
 I'll see you later. 
 Bye. 
 [Slurps] 
 What was that? 
 What? 
 That was super awkward. 
 What's wrong? Is she bullying you at school? 
 No, I just... 
 Come on, that girl wanted to be your friend. 
 She was really cool. 
 Yeah, I guess. I don't know. 
 Do you ever hang out with your classmates? 
 Not really. I mean... I hang out with you guys! 
 Wait, are we in the way of you making new friends? 
 No, it's just... it's ... it's not like they want to hang out with me. 
 What?! That's crazy! 
 You're Chloe! You're awesome! This is unacceptable. 
 Okay, we're gonna give you all the secrets. 
 What secrets? 
 How to become super popular, you silly. 
 We'll be showing you how to make new friends. 
 Ice Bear will make them love Chloe. 
 Mm, I don't know. 
 Chloe, you got to trust me on this. This'll be good. 
 By the end of this mission, everybody's gonna want to be your friend. 
 Uh... okay. 
 Whoo-hoo! All right! Let's do this! 
 And let me take this phone number of Amy's, in case she ever calls me ... I mean, if she calls Chloe! 
 Okay, first tip. People like confidence. 
 And if you want to look confident, you got to make yourself look bigger. 
 How do I do that? 
 I'll give a demonstration. Check this out. 
 [Moaning] 
 Easy, breezy ... confident. 
 I don't know, Grizz. 
 You got this. 
 Okay, first you got to lift those guns real high,  then show your biggest confident smile. 
 [Spits] 
 Bam! You're ready. Now get out of here. 
 [Grumbling] 
 Hey. 
 [Screams] 
 Well, she's got to come back for the purse. 
 And when she does ... boom! New friend. 
 Panda : In all the romantic movies I've seen, the way to get people to like you is to stumble, drop all your fancy papers, and then magically,  the person of your dreams comes to your rescue. 
 In your case, it will be your new friend. 
 Go fall in friendship! 
 You're a natural! 
 
 
 
 [Wind howls] 
 I thought this was about making friends, not fighting enemies. 
 All Ice Bear's friends are future enemies. Huh! 
 All right, you mastered the techniques. Time to put them to the test. 
 By the way, you're doing great. 
 Really? You think so? 
 For sure. You'll be making a friend any minute now. 
 Remember ... confidence. 
 Don't forget your fancy papers. 
 Go for their legs. 
 [Growling] 
 Look at her go. 
 [Growling continues] 
 Huh? 
 [Sighs] I look ridiculous. 
 Easy, breezy ... confident. 
 Ohh! She's not doing what we taught her! 
 She needs our help. Quick. Call her. 
 [Dialing] 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 ♪ She's my girl ♪ 
♪ she's the only one in the world ♪ 
 Oh, I hate that song. Only little kids listen to that stuff. [Laughs] Yeah, man. Ooh! Huh? I'm sorry. Oh, hey! You're that prodigy girl, aren't you? [Chuckles] It's got to be so weird. Yeah. It is. Bye. It's not that important, guys. Thanks for trying. I'm ... I'm just gonna go home. Thanks for walking me home. I'm okay now. We'll wait. [Speaks Korean] Oh. Oh, hi. Hey, guys. This is my mom. Hello. Hi. Annyeonghaseyo. Um, um, Ann Yo-Ann... An... annyuh... uh, annn... hase... Oh. Heh-ho? [Laughs] Annyeonghaseyo. [Speaking Korean] Hmm. [Speaking Korean] Nothing. I got to go finish up some homework. Thanks for walking me home. See ya. Uh... [Speaking Korean] We were trying to help Chloe make some new friends at school today. It didn't go too well. [Scoffs] They're a bunch of poopers, anyways. We'll find Chloe better ones. I'm Grizz, by the way. Ice Bear. And you must be Panda. [Speaking Korean] Ah. [Laughs] Hey, what are they saying about me? Oh, thank you for being so nice to our Chloe. She talks about you guys all the time. It's been hard for her, being the smartest kid  in a small school and now at this big college, surrounded by people who are older. Oh, she'll be fine. Chloe's, like, the coolest kid we know. Ice Bear will make everyone know that. Yeah, she's gonna have so many friends, you'll probably regret it. We hope so. Well, thanks again. It was great meeting you, Mr. and Mrs. Park. Annyeonghaseyo. [Speaking Korean] Bye. Grizz : Chloe's dad's right. She is surrounded by older people, and they probably think Chloe's just a kid. Could we make her look older? Ice Bear can make Chloe look like a grandma. [Party music playing] What? No, not that old. The point is to make them look about the same age. Grizz? Wait, that's it! That's what? We're gonna throw a party. What party? The mature people's party ... a party to showcase how mature Chloe is. Hey, that's a great idea. [Cellphone vibrating] Panda : Our place. 6 PM. Be there. :) ["Eine kleine nachtmusik" plays] [knocks] [Refined voice] Ah! Good evening, madam! Welcome! Huh? [Glass clangs] Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? May I present to you the duchess of matureville ... Chloe. Grizz, what's going on? Why are you guys talking like that? Oh, tisk, tisk. Always so modest. Come. Join us for a tour of your kingdom. This collection was a generous gift from Mr. Rochester at the copy store. Our fine-dining hors d'oeuvres ... cookie-dough tartar. And, of course, you know our famous house artist Jacques le Panda. Salutations, fellow adults. Have you met Chloe? She's as mature as they get. Uh, I just came here 'cause the flier said there would be free pizza. Chloe is a strong, independent woman. Don't you think? Meet Chloe. She's very old. Um, hi. This is Tom. He's an awesome volleyball player, and he loves science. This is Alyssa. When she's not serving coffee, she's studying to be a doctor. This is Pedro. He is so funny. [Light switch clicks] [Lounge music plays] Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Nice to see you all again, and welcome to the grown-up podcast, featuring Chloe, the most mature person on campus. [whispers] Guys, please stop this. I know what you're trying to do, but... Uh, where's the free pizza again? [Groans] Uh, o-okay. Lets, um, go to our musical segment. - Jacques? Oui, oui. [Up-tempo music plays] Uh, uh, whoops! No! Aah! Dude, what's going on? I can't turn it off! Hey, everyone, please control yourselves! This is a mature party. And ... No! [Music continues] Ooh! Uh... Five-second rule. [Chuckles] Just joking. Hey, Chloe. Remember, it's me, Amy, you know, from earlier at the boba shop. Oh, um, hey. What are you doing here? [Music continues] Hey, careful of the art! Wait, where's Chloe? Panda, where's Chloe? I thought she was with you. We got to find her. Ah! What are you doing?! Stop it! Hey, go away! It's crazy. People think it's so cool to be "a prodigy." Why can't I just be called the awkward Korean girl who will never be tall enough to ride a roller coaster? [Both laugh] Hey, Amy. We're thinking of heading out. This place is getting a bit crazy. Uh, hey, guys. Meet Chloe. She's in our class. Hi. It's too crazy in there. Let's go around. Oh, hey, it's Chloe. I see her. Dude, look at all the people she's talking to. It looks like she made some friends. I'll just call her and tell her where we are. [Cellphone vibrating] ♪ She's my girl ♪ Amy : Hey, Chloe. Come here. Check this out. [Cellphone beeps] Oh. Coming! Well, we did it. We threw an awesome party, and Chloe made some new friends. Well, guess we'll just hang out here for a while. Yep. All alone. [Clears throat] [Crickets chirping] Aah! Come on, guys. Sounds like the party's over. Whoa. Well, everyone's gone. Including Chloe. Let's just start cleaning up. Oh, man. I already miss Chloe so much. Yeah. It's not gonna be the same around here without her. Uh, guys... It's like I can still hear her sweet voice. Ohh! Chloe? Is it really you? [Muffled] Yes. What are you still doing here? Why aren't you with your new friends? I told them we would hang later. Plus I wanted to help you guys clean. This place is a serious mess. So, we're still friends? Of course. Thank you guys for throwing me this amazing party. You guys are the best. Now, let's clean up this place. So, Chloe, what you gonna do tomorrow? Uh... Uh... uh, camping? Uh, biking? A Grizzly bear! Chloe's going to biochemistry at 11:00 A.M.  - Got it! Ha-ha! Oh.
