 Hey, thanks for the ride, Lucy. Oh, of course. Uh, hey, what are you guys doing for dinner? Uh, I don't know, actually. [Mumbling] Oh, I don't know anything ... What? I think we got nothing planned. Well, there's this new restaurant on 45th and Spruce. Here. I'll write it down for you. it's like a French Italian fusion-y thing. Grizzly : Yes, I would eat that. Great. So, it's a date. Grizzly : Yep. All four of us. Ice Bear requires booster seat. Thanks. Today's been so fun. And to think ... the whole reason we met is 'cause my little bro is [baby-talking] a swollen bundle of allergies. [Laughs] Aww, you guys are the cutest. [Engine turns over] See you soon. Oh, man. Lucy is so chill. She might be the coolest person we know. Ice Bear made her a pashmina. Let's get fancied up. I think we've got some nice clothes in the closet somewhere. Hmm. Closet... Tonight's gonna be so fu... Hey, guys! You want to play a game? I know a really good one. Game, you say? Hmm? We're listening. Yeah, it's a little game. It's gonna be super-fun and quick. You're gonna love it. Okay, first, you get in here. I like this. And, uh... count to 1,000. Oh. [Laughs] [Door opens, closes] I see. This is fun. One... [Thinking] Come on, Panda. You can do this. Uh, 'scuse me. [Grunts] Panda! Over here! Panda! Huh? ♪ Girl be selling sunshine ♪ 
♪ Girl be selling sunshine ♪ 
♪ Looking so fine ♪ 
♪ Looking so fine ♪ Hey, Panda. Panda. Huh? I'm right here. Hey. Where's your brothers? They're sick! With vomit! Um, they're not feeling great. Are they okay? Should we go see them? No! No! No! Contagious. Upchucking everywhere. The walls, the carpet ... oh, boy. Okay. Let's eat. For you. Grizzly : 999 ... Wait a minute! Lucy! We're late! [Door rattling] And the door's locked. Quick ... give me a coat hanger and some gum. I know a way to ... That works, too. Is everything all right? A-Are you sure you're not sick, too? Nope. All good here. No vomit on me. [laughs] [Chuckles] Are you two ready to order? Uh... why don't you go first? Oh, sure. Uh, just give me a second. Um... You know, I've heard it's best to fully immerse yourself in your menu like this. [Thuds] You guys need a minute? Um, how long do we immerse ourselves? That little sneak. He's still playing a game, and he's got Lucy in on it. [Chuckles] Game on. Oh, phew. Whoo-hoo! Good menu sesh, right? [Chuckles] I got really immersed there. Ha! Yeah. Anyway, I'll have the Thai noodle salad, please. Mm-hmm. And for you, sir? Egg. Frittata it is, then. [Indistinct conversations] Oh, no. This restaurant is too happening. We need another way in. [Knock on door] About time. It's crazy in here. Phase one successful. Now all we need to do is get through... this kitchen! Here we go. Follow my lead. Thank goodness you're here. Take this to table 4, this to 17, two for 18, and water for 50 through 70, and come right back when you're through. We made it. Hey! You know what I really like? Moving tables into dark corners. Panda, wait. Uh, so, do you do this every time you eat out or... [Sputters] Grizzly : Your meal, my good sir. And may I just say excellent [burps] choice. So, where is that Panda? I know I saw him around here somewhere. Waiter! Panda, is there a reason ... Wow! Look that table over there! Oh, there you guys are. I have your ord... Perfect. Thank you. Uh... here. Aah! Oop. Mind if we squeeze in here? Oh, is this a birthday? Congratulations. [Chuckles] Panda, do you even know these people? Uh... Whoa! What's under here? Oop! [Sighs] Panda... Oh, hey, Lucy. What's up? What's up? What ... What do you mean? We-We're hiding under a table. What? No. We're not hiding. It's just... atmospheric down here. Atmospheric? Panda, you've been dragging me around all evening. [Sighs] I'm not really hungry anymore. Maybe we should just call it a night. No, no, no. Don't go! We're having a great time. Everything's going perfectly. It's only gonna get more ... Oh, there you guys are. I have your ... See! More fun! [Muffled] Mmm! Delicious! Panda, I think that was my order. Huh? It had peanuts in it. [Machine beeping] Hey, Panda? Panda, you there? Is my little Panpan there? Oop, there he is. Huh? What ... What happened? [Chuckles] Oh, man. It wasn't pretty. You had a major allergic reaction. You were flopping all over. You flipped the table. There was food everywhere. Am I missing anything? Vomit. Oh, yeah. Lots of vomit. Ugh. Oh, no! What about Lucy? She was here earlier, but she had to leave. She left you something, though. She says you didn't get the chance to eat, so she saved your dish for you. Are you doing okay there, buddy? Kind of. I mean, I thought Lucy was, um... I-I really liked, um ... Ugh! I'm so dumb. Wait, did ... did you like her? Dude, you should have just told us! We would have totally gotten out of your way. Ice Bear would have been less charming. It's cool, you guys. I'm just a little embarrassed, I guess. Grizzly : Don't be. We're always here for you, man. You probably didn't have a chance, though. Huh?
