 [Panting] 
 Here! 
 Lock the door! 
 [Look engages] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Crash!] 
 [Both scream] 
 Aah! What do we do? 
 Gloria, listen ... I have a confession to make. 
 It was I who released the virus. My fault ... me! 
 No, no! Say it ain't true, Max! 
 [Crash!] 
 [Both scream] 
 Oh, stop! Pause, pause, pause, pause! 
 Why, what's going on? 
 I need to check online to make sure everything turns out okay in the end. 
 I am not gonna see this girl get eaten, man! 
 Ugh, all right, then. But just hurry up. 
 Okay. 
 No spoilers! 
 Ice Bear made kettle corn. 
 Ooh! Just a little, I guess. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
 This can't be happening! 
 What? What is it? Does she survive? 
 Who did this?! 
 [Gasps] No, no, no! 
 It's not working! 
 It's dead. 
 Noooo! 
 So many fun times, so many good websites. 
 He was like another brother. 
 Ice Bear is sad. 
 How did this happen?! 
 That's what I'd like to ask you guys. 
 Are you blaming me here? 
 Well, it wasn't me. 
 So it must be one of you that did it. 
 Ice Bear always offline. 
 He's right. You're the one that uses it the most. 
 Yeah, with caution ... unlike you two! 
 Ice Bear not guilty. 
 Ugh! All right, man. We lost one brother already. 
 I'm not gonna lose another. Give me a hug. 
 Okay. Now let's get this fixed. 
 This'll probably cost a couple hundred dollars to repair. 
 We don't have that kind of cash. 
 Hmm... well, why don't we get a job? 
 Grizz, we've never had jobs before. I mean, who would hire us anyway? 
 Dude, don't worry, just leave it up to me. 
 Uh... so this résumé is for all three of you guys? 
 Oh, yes, sir! 
 Hmm. Skills ... firm hand shaking, touching nose with tongue,  high fives, low fives. Too slows? 
 Mm-hmm. Oh, I also forgot to write "thumbs up." 
 [Sighs] Okay, guys, look ... 
 Please, sir, I beg you! 
 Please hire us! We have other skills! 
 Panda, sing! 
 Uh... 
 ♪ Hey, girl with the pretty eyes ♪ 
♪ in the club, don't you realize ♪ 
♪ throw your hands up in the sky ♪ 
 [Laughs] Okay, okay. Stop, I get it. 
 I like the determination, guys. 
 It's just what we need. You're hired. 
 Really? 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 Yeah! 
 Wait, what's the job? 
 Right this way. Here's where you'll be working. 
 It's a cupcake store! 
 Whoa! 
 It's beautiful! 
 This is going to be the best job ever. 
 Ice Bear wants to work here forever. 
 Right this way. 
 This is the cupcake ATM. 
 Ooh! 
 The cupcake ATM is very simple. 
 First, you hit the start button on the screen, then you choose your flavor, then the icing. 
 And once you've picked your final toppings, Boom, your handcrafted cupcake will drop down below. Got it? Oh, totally! Your job is to stay out here and help if there are any problems. Here's your uniform. All right, you two, follow me. Welcome to cupcake central! Wow! The order from the ATM comes up on this screen here. First the batter... then the oven... the frosting... and the toppings. And, finally, pure cupcake perfection. Ooh, can we eat that? No. No eating. So, for your job all you have to do is place the finished cupcake in a box, place a sticker to seal the deal, then pop it into this chute. Now, here's your hat and bow tie. Ooh, nice! Oh, no, no. I have another job for you. All right. Your job is to get all these beautiful people to buy our delicious cupcakes! Just one extra rule for the job ... you got to smile. Come on, let's see those pearly whites! No, no, much bigger. Bigger... Almost there. Perfect! There it is. Now, good luck. I'll be back at the end of the day. Huh? Cupcake. Cupcake. Cupcake. Hello there, sir! Allow me to assist you with your order. Uh, okay. What would you like, sweetpea? Strawberry creme. Ah, excellent choice! All right! Okay, yeah... Hmm... Ah, gotcha! Okay... [chuckles] Uh, hmm... Hmm, hmm, hmm. Artisan... [Beeping] Smart kid. Okay, I got this. 
 
 Hello, there! In you go. [Humming] Beautiful! [Chuckles] Man, that was easy. You enjoy your cupcake! Hello! Let me help you out there. Oh, thanks so much. I never know how to work these things. Yeah, that's no problem. I'm here to help. What would you like? Ooh! Hmm... Just, uh, pick a flavor, sir. Okay, okay ... chocolate! Ah, great choice. No, no, wait! Make it vanilla! Uh, sure. What kind of frosting do you have? Is the frosting cold? How many sprinkles are you putting on? Wait, wait. No, no, no, no, go back. Huh? Cupcake. Cupcake. Huh? [Cries] Cupcake. Cupcake. [gasps] [Barks] Maybe a strawberry. No, I changed my mind. Vanilla swirl! No. Man, I can't make up my mind. Sir, there is a very long line behind you, so just pick anything! Okay, okay, just get me three cupcakes ... One chocolate, one vanilla, and one red velvet. Okay, great. And how would you like to pay? Oh, could you split it between four cards? [Groans] [Humming] In you go. Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Phew! Huh? [Sigh] What? Ugh! Get off me! Huh? [Laughter] [Crowd talking indistinctly] [Crowd murmuring] Uh, do you, uh, need any help, sir? The ATM's broken or something. It won't give me my cash. Uh, sir, this is a cupcake ATM, not a real ATM. But, I need cash ... whoa! I don't like having my time wasted, cupcake bear. I have a flight to Tokyo in an hour. I need a cupcake with 2/3 dark chocolate batter, heavy cream frosting ... exactly an inch thick. Sprinkles on one half. I would like you to crush exactly three pistach... [Alarm blares] Aah! What's going on? What's happening? Aah! Uh... uh... Huh?! Here you are, ma'am. One cupcake fresh from the oven. Is this some kind of joke? Oof! What the heck, little bro? This is completely unprofessional. Okay, let me just go see what's going on in the kitchen. Man: Where do you think you're going? You can't leave us hanging! - Come on, man! I'm losing my mind back here! I don't want to wait anymore! I mean... Whoa, hold up! Okay, look, just calm down, and I'll get everyone a cupcake. Let's see. One, two, three, eight, nine ... Ah, just say an even 30. [Beeping] Wait, what?! No, no! [Siren wailing] Stop, stop, stop! Phew! Huh?! Oh, why are there so many?! Um, um... No. Steady... Come on, stop! Shut down! Turn off! [Groans] Huh? No! [Sizzle] Ow! [Grunting] What's going on? [Chuckles] Uh, just, uh, just a minute, sir. Just having some technical issues. Okay, please, everyone, just calm ... Get the bear! [Chuckles] [Crowd yelling] [Panting] Huh? Panda! Brother, speak to me! What happened? Too many cupcakes! Panda, snap out of it! [Crowd clamoring] Aah! What's going on? Panda, listen, I have a confession to make. It was me who broke the laptop. My fault ... me! No, I have a confession. It was really me who broke the laptop. I just didn't want to admit it. Huh, wait, you mean we both broke the laptop? But how? "To reach the boss key, you..." ♪ hey, girl with the pretty eyes ♪ [Glass breaks] So that's how that happened. [Crash!] [Both scream] [Crowd clamoring] What do we do? I got it! Panda, what do these people want more than anything else? A cupcake? Not just any cupcake. What we need is to make them is a giant delicious cupcake. Yeah. [Music] [Crowd clamoring] Everybody, stop! I know what it is you want, and... here it is! Huh? Are we supposed to eat that? Uh, yeah, it's for all of you. It looks kind of uncooked. And it's ugly. [Sniffs] It smells like burnt rubber. Thank you, I guess? Let's look for another... [Crowd murmuring] Well, at least we still get paid. Yes, uh-huh, all the customers have been given gift cards and an apology. Yes, sir. Okay, yes, I'll let them know. Okay. So, um, when do we get our money checks? By the way, you're fired! Ugh, I guess we can't fix our laptop yet. Man, I don't want to get another job. Ice Bear got paid. [Gasps] Whoa, check it out! Look at all this money! Ah, I knew we could do it! Let's go! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Ice Bear has a confession to make. [Clunking] [Music]
