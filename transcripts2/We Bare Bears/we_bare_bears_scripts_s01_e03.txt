♪ we'll be there ♪ [Music] [Birds chirping] [Indistinct conversations] Aw, man! When do we get to eat? This line's taking forever! Ice Bear's tired of staring at this guy's butt. Can you tell me how much longer? I may die soon. From up here, I would say... 15 to 75 minutes. Whoa! Is that the ramen taco? Lucky! Aah! Ugh! Wow. There it is. I want to eat my phone now. I told you we should've settled for the mac-and-cheese pizza truck. No, Panda. When it comes to food, we never settle. Okay, okay! We're good, law-abiding citizens. We deserve that ramen taco! Maybe 10 of them. Goodbye, cruel world. Oooof!-e Ooof! Man : Order 74! [Bell dings] Next! [Grizzly grunts, clears throat] [Weakly] Please, sir ... ramen tacos. We've waited so long. So hungry. Is that it? Next! Okay, bros, small bites. Savor it. It has so many textures. It's spongy. [spits] Ice Bear regrets eating that. Dude, you're right. What's up with this food? It's gross! We waited four hours in line for this? [Squirrel chitters] Here you go, little guy. Um, Griz, look. Whoa. Close one. Come on. Let's go get our money back. Sorry, little guy. Uh, yeah, I'll have the ... Excuse us, friend. Hi, yes, um, we weren't completely satisfied with our meal. Can we have our money back? You guys can't return food. This is half-eaten, anyways. You think I'm a chump or something? Well, no. But we just thought what we waited for wasn't really equal to the quality of food. No offense. Oh. So now you're gonna rip on my food? Get lost! Next! What? Oh, we understand! Your food stinks! No, I'm not done complaining yet! I will be heard ... on the internet! "Worst food ever" ... 1/4 star. Why give 1/4? They have to learn. Eh, I liked the ambience. Well, I'm not pulling any punches. "Eat here if you hate"... um, uh... "eating." [Cellphone bloops] Yeah. I don't know what's worse ... selling terrible food or the fact that people like it. It's a shame. Sometimes I just don't understand this world anymore. Yeah, I guess some people just can't tell the difference between good food and... [Chomps] [Gasps, slurps] ...crazy-amazing food! Oh, my gosh! Ice Bear knows. [Sniffs] [Chomps] Mmm! Oh, man. This is way better than that ramen taco truck. Ha! That's it! [Chomps] Okay, you guys, this is going to blow your mind. What? Let's start our own food truck! Hmm. That's not a bad idea, I guess. Mm-hmm. It couldn't be that hard. Mm-hmm. And our food is totally better than that shady taco truck. Mm-hmm. And we'll get a ton of customers and be super-rich! Yeah! Yeah! Ice Bear is in. Both : Yeah! [Truck horn plays "La Cucaracha"] [Hip-hop music plays] Whoooaaaa! Whooooaaaa! Yeah! Uh-huh! Hey! Hey! Hey! What? It's the beeeaaar's calzone! Ye-e-ah! ♪ Calzone in my mouth ♪ [Clears throat] Anyways... come and enjoy our wonderful calzones! Please! Whoo! Ha! Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] Woman : Yeah, two ramen tacos. Okay, guys, you know what to do. Sir, would you like a sample? California-shaped calzone. Don't be shy. It's free. Unh-unh. Sir, would you like to try a sample? No, thanks. Free sample? Uh... Please just try it! I promise you'll love it! I'm sorry. Fresh calzones! [Exhales sharply] Okay. Ow. H-Hey, would you like to try a calzone? No? Okay. Whew! Ohhhh. Um... ohh... Uh... Oh, hey, you should get a calzone! Or not. Just keep walking. That's fine. Oh! Ow. 
 
 [Indistinct conversations] [Groaning] Samples? [Groans] [Grunts] [Growls] I don't get it. Our food is good. Why do people eat that stuff? Hey, you! Why don't you eat our food?! Huh?! Why?! It's so delicious! [Man whimpers] Would you like to try a sample? Let go of me! Okay. Geez. [Groans] There, there. [Squirrel chitters] Wha? Wha? A paying costumer! But, Griz! $500?! That could end our lives! Ohh! So torn! [Bell dings] Huh? Huh? Thank you, sir. One calzone coming right up. Here you go, friend. Enjoy! Whoo-hoo! Ha ha! Look at this! We're rich! Aah! [All chittering] [Snoring] Mm. You want to try a sample? [Shuffling in distance] Huh? [Muttering] Oh! [Drowsily] What's going on? Ohaaaaah! How did these guys get their money? Hey! [Beeping] Let's cook! Whoo-hoo! Next. Next! Next. Keep 'em coming! We got a ton of orders coming in! Panda : Thank you. Grizzly : Come again. [Chuckles] Thank you, sir. [Laughs] Oh, yeah! ♪ Get it, calzone in my mouth, yeah ♪ 
♪ get it, calzone in my mouth, yeah ♪ 
♪ get it, calzone in my mouth, yeah ♪ 
♪ get it, calzone ♪ Here you go, sir. Come again! Oh, man! Totally owned those other food trucks! Hey! What are you guys doing?! You're driving away all the customers! [Wolves howl] Ugggh! [Crowd gasps] [All gasp] [All gasp] Oh, you're just jealous 'cause our calzones are legit! [Bird squawks] Hey! You didn't pay for that! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! [Possum chittering] [Growls] [Wolves barking] [Horns blaring, indistinct shouting] [Tires squeal] Fellow food truckers, on behalf of myself and my bros, we'd like to say... "our bad." That food truck was all I had. My food truck was passed down to me for three generations. I lost my family in the food truck. I will never see them again. Oops. Never mind. There they are. [Sighs] One last picture. Aah! Wait! That's it! Hey, I'm not done posting it! Step off! Follow me, food truckers! To freedom! [Animals chittering] Come on, everyone! [Bird squawks] Whoa! Oof! [Animals grumbling] [Gasps] [All growling, snarling] [Hoots] Get behind me, bros! You guys up there, be cool. We got this under cont... Well, that was kind of rude. [Animals snarl] [gasps] [Cellphone beeping] Oh, no! The battery's dead! Du... Bo... Baaaah! Run! [Wind rushing] [All sniffing] [All gagging] [Animals whimpering] Hooray! Yeah! [All sniff, gag] Okay, that's a fine for feeding the animals, selling without a permit, driving an unregistered truck, and disturbing the peace. Yeah, it's not like this is the first ticket we've ever gotten. Thank you, officer. Well, at least we taste great. Mmm. 1/4 star!
