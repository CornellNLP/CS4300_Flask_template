 [DRILLING NOISE] 
 Leo :  Awful. 
 Hearts and lungs and guts. prime cuts and gristle. 
 And that's it. [METALLIC, ECHOING BANG] I know every clove of garlic has a soul, even artichokes have hearts, but me, I'm not so sure. [BANG] My very own little meat fridge. The light really does go out when you close the door. [BANG] [SOFT CHEERFUL MUSIC] They say death comes to us all. But what they don't tell you is that nobody just leaves. No, we're only traces, echoes, and trouble. Lots of trouble. One lie can ruin a thousand truths. And the truth is, I loved Sam. But Gina was never going to tell her. She always had a flexible relationship with the truth. If she didn't like it, she simply ignored it. Believe me, it's one hell of a skill. You have to tell her. I just don't see how it's relevant. You know if you don't want to do it face to face maybe you should just text her. That's what the young people are doing now. "Hey, by the way, your dead husband still loved you," smiley face. You should try this. I'm not hungry. You said that yesterday. I am still not hungry. I though we were getting somewhere, with all of this... Where is "somewhere", exactly, morbid obesity? No, it's some thing . Somewhere is something. 
I want you to eat some thing . I'm not hungry. My father has just died. I'm in mourning. Bullshit. How dare you? How dare you say something like that to me? That is sh1t, Teresa, and you know it! You've been starving yourself like this for a year now, it's not healthy, and it's not right, and it's not normal! You  are not normal! At least I'm not a liar. Right! Fine, you win! Okay! I'll take her a lasagna and I'll tell her. Will that make you happy? Nothing will ever make me happy. But I still think you should tell Sam the truth. [BLENDER WHIRRING] Er, and here's your keys. You're in our bridal suite. And I think it's a lovely anniversary present. It's so romantic. 40 years. Does it seem like 40 years since we were last here, Jen? Honestly? It feels longer. Well, it's never too late for a second honeymoon. Dan will show you to your room. Thank you! Thank you. Leo :  Advice to the living: be careful what you leave behind. Because they're gonna see it. I should never have written that damn letter. Sam : It's right here. 
Exactly what he wants. A funeral in the Sicilian tradition. And you're doing eulogy. What? "Michael Vincent to give the formal address." But an  open  coffin. Are we sure this is genuine? He was raised in the Church of England specifically to prevent any of this religious nonsense. Leo's handwriting... And the wake... it's more like a banquet. Rigato di Vitelli alla Milanese... Porchetto Ariccio?! And, I don't see why I should have to do a eulogy. I mean is that what the vicar does? The whole thing is ridiculous. And look how he addressed it: 
"My darling wife". Like he was hedging his bloody bets. Where are you going? Out. But we agreed that you would stay with Mimi. She's fine. No, no, no. You said that you... Oh, let the boy go. I'm quite capable of quietly dying of grief, while he masturbates to death in front of the Xbox. See? Back to normal service. Has he spoken to you? About any of this? He seems fine! That what's worries me. He'll come to you when he's ready. [THUNDER] Michael : Good morning, boss. You made a real mess of that, didn't you? Yeah. Sorry about that. So? Hum... Yeah, I'm okay. Sure you are. They want me to do a speech. At his funeral. Alright, you sh1tting yourself? No. Er, yeah. [EXHALES] Dad wanted me to do it. Ah, I guess that means you better do it. What if I'll really, really don't want to? Well, that's a point of becoming a man. Mean you got to do a lot of stuff you don't want to. Y'know, put down the toilet seat, eating salad, getting married. So how is your mum? Did you talk to her? Yeah, sort of. You know, you should. ♪Listening. That's another one, by the way. Ah, it's a funny thing, death! I mean, we all got it coming but it always happens to someone else. Until it doesn't. [TENSION BUILDING] It's a...  consolo. Everyone cooks for the grieving family, it's a Sicilian tradition. Like blowing up judges. That looks amazing. 
But we are fine. Honestly. Well, everyone has to eat. 
Especially at a time like this. And... Obviously we got to... talk about... a few things. Did Leo mention anything to you? About his funeral. Not specifically. I suspect he regarded himself as above this inconvenience of ...actually dying. It seems not. He left this. "Porchetta Ariccio." "Funghi Trifolati". Aah. But you know what this is. This menu... is our history. Leo and me. These are the dishes that made our name. My family recipes. This menu is our marriage. Mimi : Ah, I think it's ridiculous! But this is what he wanted. His last request. Perhaps he should have thought about that  before  he slept with his ex-wife. So, you're refusing to carry out his last wishes, despite the fact that they're here in black and white? Leo will have a perfectly respectable funeral. As his wife, it's  my  duty to see to that. But that's all. [TENSION BUILDING] Can you believe she wanted to just ignore it? Well, obviously. His dying wishes! So you knew about this? Dad did mention before that he wanted the full  Godfather ? No, not specifically, but y'know he was a passionate man, he loved the tradition, the theatre... The infidelity. So how did the other bit go? What other bit? The whole "he wanted you back" business, the whole reason you went round there in the first place. Oh, right, yeah. Fine. 
Yeah, she seemed very pleased. "Pleased"? Well, you know, not pleased, relieved. 
You know, better. You know what I mean. I was wrong and you were right. 
It helped her a lot. And you, dear, how are you copping? I'm fine. That's what I thought. You forget I've been through all this before. When my George died it was like an army of manoeuvres. There was no time to think. But... ruin comes soon enough. And when it does, you find me. Hi. Hi. It's weird, isn't it? All this. It's not just weird, it's f*cking weird. So, how is Gina? Cooking. I swear, if they dropped a bomb, she'd be stirring risotto. How's yours? Hum... I don't really know what she thinks. She doesn't really talk to me. Sounds like heaven. Do you wanna swap? I mean, you'd had to live with a mad woman that wish to make you hungry. [HE LAUGHS] Oh god, I'm so sorry! I just heard. Are you alright? Er... Yeah, I think so. I'm so sorry. [SHE SIGHS] Does this mean you're an orphan? Er, well... [SHE BREATHES SHARPLY] Michael : I suppose so, yeah. Daisy : How do you feel? I feel alone. You're not alone. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? ♪ Bye. [EXHALES] Leo :  Every man remembers the first time. No, not that. The first time it doesn't work. Dying is easy compared to that. [MUSIC STOPS] In fact... [SIGHS] It's so fine, it's... 
Almost better than if we had... You know. Maybe we should just... Like, talk. I need to go. Reverend : A Sicilian funeral? Gina : Mmh. It seems a little... unusual. [STAMMERS] I thought Leo was Church of England. Not that he ever attended. He was a very religious man, but his relationship with God was very... personal and unique. Well, I can see that. An open coffin? You Catholics are so macabre. But can you help us? Honestly... The Anglican Church is nothing if not flexible. It'll be my honour to help you... Ah! [DOOR OPENS] in any way I possibly can. [DOOR CLOSING] My... sincere condolences, Sam. Er, Gina and I were just discussing funeral arrangements. Sam : You've invited the entire village! That is the tradition. The community pays its respects, and the family repays them with a feast celebrating the life of the deceased. And of course, a suit needs to be delivered to the funeral directors. A suit?! Yeah. Black is traditional. Sam : I don't want to have this conversation now! It's just I really think someone else would be better! He asked you! It's not an option. Yeah, I know, but... I reckon he thought I was gonna be older, you know, when he died. So I'd be better at public speaking. You think  I  want to do all this? Any of it? You think I want to go crawling to that bitch Gina Benelli so she can cook up some bullshit meal and have everyone falling over her? Have to stand there and smile and make conversation with a village full of people who's always hated my guts! This is not all about you. You are eighteen. Grow the f*ck up! Oh, sh1t. [SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS] [SOBS] [SOBBING] Leo :  First, the body comes home. Next, the church service. Finally, the wake itself. A feast fit to send any man to heaven. He really wanted all this? Well, Leo loved the tradition. And the whole idea of being the centre of attention. I think it's creepy. Just everyone just staring down at a dead person. It's just a body. It's not the person you loved. Here. [TERESA CLEARS HER THROAT] Thanks. You really shouldn't smoke. I know. So why do you do it? Don't know. I tried the vaping thing, but the lack of lingering death never really worked for me. I think my dad was the same. Leo didn't smoke! He didn't do a lot of things... officially. b*st*rd! He made me give up, when we first met. Wrinkles. That was his main concern. It gives you a mouth like a cat's ass. That's a direct quote. So you hate her the most, right now? I don't hate her. It's just... If it was anyone else. I thought it was Suzie. The new manager? The younger model. The midlife-crisis woman, buy her a Ferrari, screw it out. But instead darling daddy f*cked the old fear in the back of the garage. He went back to her. So what does that make me? The blip. Twenty years of marriage, and what is it really? Bloody blip. She didn't tell you, did she? Tell me what? Mmh. Mummy dearest. He ditched her. Right after you found out. Told her it was all a huge mistake. He said that? He came to the cottage, begged her to persuade you to take him back. Right before... you know. Why are you telling me this? Because it's the truth. I've always been a big fan of honesty. I think I'm unique in this family. Thank you. Want some? Deodorant! I hate to smell bad more than anything else. Dad gave it to me. Another of his little secrets. Thanks. You're welcome. Off out? Oh, we have some leaflets. No need. We got it all planned. Electronically, no less. Siri. She must be obeyed. Got us on a strict timetable. Down to the last second. Mussolini had nothing on her. 
 
 Leo :  Some people spend their life thinking about death. I never really give it the time of day. But funerals! That's another matter. Not many people get to look down on their own. I've got a front row seat. This is gonna be good. [SHE SIGHS] Well. I'm ready. I hope the good lord doesn't object to me switching sides like this. Well, she'd be a damn fool if she did. I think it's safe from lightning bolts. Mmh, you'd be surprised. You think that god is a woman? Yeah, of course I do. Don't you? You can talk to me, you know? If it'll help. I can pass on any messages. Well, tell her that I'm busy right now, Mm-mmh. but we can catch up when this is all over. No problem. Clyde : I mean, obviously it's a tragedy. Man : Obviously. Clyde : No one is talking about the economic impact. As counsel leader, it's my responsibility to look to the future. There are jobs at stake. Leo Vincent was our brand. It looks like you'll need to get a new one, then. [CHILD CRYING] Can't you just wait until tea time, I said no! Such a difficult age! No rum 'n' raisin. So I made an executive decision, and went for mint choc chip. Mmh, then I shall just have to suffer! [CHURCH ORGAN] You're okay? I'm fine. Just stop saying that. You're British. Fine is a spinal reflex. Um... I have something for you. [NOISE OF PILLS] No, take it. Just... in case. Michael : No. No, no, I-I can't do it. Simple. Just imagine me naked. What, in church? Especially in church. Okay. Okay, so, er, why don't you do it? Because, in a patriarchal society, the firstborn  son  always takes prouder place. [HE EXHALES] I thought you would've figured that out by now. [HE EXHALES]  Stark naked. [EXHALES SHARPLY] [RUSTLE OF PAPER] My father always... [HE CLEARS HIS THROAT] Er... My-my father... always... [SIGHS] [STAMMERS INCREASINGLY] 
My-my father, hum.... " Stark naked." Oh. [EXHALES] Michael : Er, f*ck, um... sorry. Hi, Michael. Go sit down. Mimi : No mother should bury a son. The very idea is an affront to decency. Against god. [SIGHS] And yet here I am. Leo... was my only child. I loved him very much. All of you knew my son. And some of you loved him, too. But I am the one who held him in my arms when he was born. And held his hand when he crossed his first busy street. And I let him weep on my shoulder when his foolish, sixteen year-old heart was broken. All of that was mine. And mine alone. Some of you may believe that age diminishes those feelings. I stand here to tell you... It doesn't. Thank you. [KEN DODD: Happiness PLAYS] 
 ♪ Happiness, happiness ♪ 
♪ The greatest skill that I possess ♪ Leo :  That was always my favourite song. My mother bought me the single for my birthday. I'd asked for The Rolling Stones, but she always knew what was good for me. ♪ I'm the luckiest human in the human race ♪ 
♪ I've got no silver and I've got no gold ♪ 
♪ But I've got happiness in my soul ♪ 
♪ Happiness to me is an ocean tide ♪ 
♪A sunset fading on a mountain side ♪ [CROWD CHATTING] Nobody minded. Honestly. I did. I'll be back in a minute. Sam. Please! Leo came to see me. He wanted me to help him talk to you. Told me that he regretted everything, and that hurt me. Because I could see in his eyes that he meant every single word. I asked him to choose, and he chose you. He wanted  you . I know. Teresa told me. She  thought I deserved the truth. And in fact, I think we both do. After I found the letter I checked Leo's will. He left everything to me. I didn't expect anything. What about Teresa? It's mine. And I've decided to sell. The cottages, the house, the Penrose. All of it. LEO: The wake. Porchetta Ariccia. The speciality of a small village just north of Roma. You take a suckling pig, gut and debone it. Stuff it with garlic, rosemary and fennel, slow-roast it over a wood fire. It's quite the finest morsel you've ever put between your lips. Gina : Next! When the Dukes of Modena wanted to intimidate their rivals, they didn't need swords or muskets. They simply invited them to diner. The expense, the luxury, the sheer indulgence, that was real power. [GIRLS LAUGHING] Mimi : Girls. Girls! What is it supposed to be? "Granita di limone". It cleans the palate. Apparently. Ah, it's disgusting! It's like toilet cleaner. Or at least what I imagined toilet cleaner would taste like. Yes, thank you. [SAM CLEARS THROAT] Apparently, Jenny Burton was drinking it for an entire month! Before they finally put her into a home. Are you okay? Yes. You need to lighten up. You're a rich man, baby. Me, I'm just a "pay as you go" girl dreaming of a contract. Yeah, but I don't care about his money, do I? Funny. That's what all the rich kids say. You really think you're smart, don't you? Look... Hell of a turnout. And you know why, right? Full bellies and full wallets. They loved our darling daddy because he made them rich. They all did. [CHEERFUL MUSIC] If the rumours are true, then we have a problem. This hotel is a big part of the community. What I'm saying is... We mustn't let a personal tragedy mushroom into an economic one. Don't you think? I think that you are a disgusting guy with a very tiny pen1s. That's the grief talking. [MUSIC FADES AWAY] You know what she's like. I mean... It... It doesn't mean I don't feel sorry for her. You're pissed, Clyde. The truth is... [CLINKING GLASS] Sam has never fitted in here. Never really been part of what I... like to call... the "real community." And that's not to say... She's an actual gold digger but pound to a penny she's back to London with the real *** before you can say... [GLASS SHATTERS] Are you... talking about my mother? And he's talking complete sh1t. 
Let's get you home. No, no, no, no, no, no. Not until he apologises. I respect your grief, young man. But I've got the right to voice. *** [BOTH GRUNTS] Ugh! Come here. Ah! [MICHAEL GRUNTS] Leave him alone. Now f*ck off. [CHEERFUL MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND] [EXHALES] You know I'm okay. You're bleeding. [SIGHS] Hold still. Ah. Ow! [EXHALES] Oh. [CROWS CAWING] No. It was your husband. I don't think it's quite that simple, do you? Leo :  Ashes to ashes... Dust to dust... The proof of the pudding... is under the crust. [CHURCH BELLS RING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [PIANO MUSIC BEGINS] Time to go home. This is the last will and testament of Leo Philip Vincent. [POURS TEA] I have confirmed that the will is legal and final. It states that Samantha Vincent is the main beneficiary of the estate. I have consolidated all the figures and I'm afraid the task was rather complex. [GASPS] As there were certain irregularities in the accounts. What kind of irregularities? Well... while on the surface, the various companies and trusts seemed healthy, on closer inspection, certain significant losses and outstanding debts had been concealed. In short... there is no estate. All there is are debts. Substantial ones. ♪ Hi. Uh, hi. Is that...? Yep. [PLOPS] Any reason why you brought old dad along? Mmh, that's what we used to do, when I was a kid. Every Sunday. Well, at least until the business thing went crazy. We could talk about fish, or we could talk about nothing. So... I chose fish. You're using our father as bait? Yeah. Well, he made millions feeding fish to people, I think it's only right that they get to eat what's left of him. So what did we just scatter? Half a disposable barbecue? Yeah. [WATER NOISE] Oh! You've... you've got one. Yeah, OK, get the net. Got it. Get the net. Just get the net. Pull harder. What now? ...you're not pulling hard enough. Just listen to me... No stop pulling! What? No, you've... [SCREAMS] You're not... What are you doing? [BOTH LAUGHING] You pulled too hard. You use the net! sh1t! Sorry. Um... Sorry. [FOOTSTEPS RUNNING AWAY] However, there is a silver lining. 
If only a small one. It seemed that as a tax avoidance strategy, the Penrose hotel had been placed in Miss Benelli's name. Several years ago. As such, it's not part of the estate. Congratulations, miss Benelli. You own this hotel. In fact you always have done. [SIGHS] I'm afraid, in situations like this, It's my duty to inform the authorities as to the extent of the irregularities. I imagine they'll want to talk to you, Mrs Vincent. But I knew nothing about this! ♪ [PANTING] Leo :  I think in the end, Doddy said it best. "To me this world is a wonderful place." "I'm the happiest human in the human race." "I've got no silver and I've got no gold," "But I've got happiness in my soul." I never understood what made Gina truly happy. But the Penrose played a part in it. Well, she's got it all now. Maybe she's got what she deserves All this time and I owned it. It's mine! I had a life, I had a career, and I just gave it all up. We kissed each other. You kissed  me ! You do realise Dr King's wedding is still booked for this weekend? Gina, I don't like you. You are unbelievable! Please, talk. Please, don't do this. I'm sorry, it's gone too far. I'm her mother! I'm not going to let her get away with it. It'll be our little secret. No more secrets, okay? Richard Hawley : Valentine ♪ Hold me ♪ 
♪ In your arms, ♪ 
♪ May they keep me ♪ 
♪ Sing me ♪ 
♪ A lullaby ♪ 
♪ 'coz I'm sleepy ♪
