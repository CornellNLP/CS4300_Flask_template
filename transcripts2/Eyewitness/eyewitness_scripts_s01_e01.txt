We've never had a murder here before. Here you go. Uh, I have never looked in this drawer before. Okay, you know what? You know what I think? No, don't think until you fill out that report.

What you mean? Well, I can't tell if he's left-handed. Those guys are usually strapped. I'm sure if Chris was left-handed, he'd have a lefty holster. Good call, Tony. I'll go to his place... check it out. Hey, uh, bad time, buddy... Helen had to head out. You, uh... you want a ride anywhere? Back home or anything? [foreboding music] Chris, pick up the phone!

Well, Helen and I, uh, wanted to give it a shot. Together... a family. You could have adopted... like a cute, little, chubby baby or something.

Listen, Philip, I'm sorry I left you in my office today. But you more than made up for it. You brought home Fang Chow. Yeah, I did. How many points do I get for that? Um, food's hot... It's not burnt. Excuse me? I'd say it's a swish from half court. Yeah, like Steve Kerr. Uh, that was about 20 years ago, babe. More like Steph Curry with the shot. Okay. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I don't know who either of those people are, so... [laughter] [phone vibrating] Sorry, guys. Hold on. Yeah, Tony? I found something on the surveillance at the gas station. That Vescovi guy, Chris... Yeah, he was talking to some kid. Looks like he borrowed his phone. Great catch. Find the kid, and get that number... that Chris dialed for me that night. Okay. Wait, how did you think to check the gas station? It's the last place to piss for 30 miles. Thank you, Tony. Well, that must've been important. Sorry. Philip, what were you gonna tell me in my office earlier? Um... my mom... the judge... He said that he might give us visits... if she got into rehab.

Hello, Kamilah. Who gave you this number? Hey, babe, remember we got our meeting... with Phil's principal this morning. You want to ride together? Nope, I just have to stop by the station first. I'll be right behind you. Is that about the case? No, I just have to sign off on the budget, but I'll see you there. 9:00. Hello? You know the old car wash on Route 9? Yeah. I'll see you there in an hour. [ OPEN 24 HOURS COIN OP & AUTOMATIC CAR WASH ] So what's to discuss? Told you it was a one-off. Yeah, you also told me Chris Petronelli... was a foot soldier you'd never met. Yeah, that's right. So you want to tell me why he called you... an hour before he was killed? Someone walked away from that cabin. Well, the FBI didn't find any evidence of that. Well, that's embarrassing, because I did. Chris is a lefty. So? So why is he holding his gun in his righthand... unless someone placed it there? I think the killer is still out there. If there is a killer out there, are you gonna be the one to find him? [laughs] What is that supposed to mean? Just figured you wouldn't be up to the task... you know, after Buffalo. [Landlines' "Will/Worry" playing] ♪ ♪
