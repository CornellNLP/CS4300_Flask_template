 Previously on "Eyewitness"... 
 What if you told Helen alone? You could leave me out of it. No, I wasn't there. Nothing happened. I just need to clear my head. [dramatic music] Do you see it? It's right there. Okay, no one is gonna see that. You want them to find it, don't you? You never really talk much about your time in Buffalo. Not much to talk about. There's got to be something that made you move out here, right? My mom had this boyfriend, Billy. He did a lot of drugs. One time, he was on this yellow couch. He looked like he was sleeping, but he didn't wake up. Why don't I have a new informant yet? What about your sister? Who's your sister? She runs with the Vescovis. She knows everybody, all the players. Are you here to kill me, Angel? No, I'm here to save you. I need to you take care of Mithat. ♪ ♪ [grunts] Lukas saw everything. I saw the gun. What gun? From the shooting. I know where it is. I could show you. [soft music] ♪ ♪ [sighs] I never should've told you guys. Lukas is gonna kill me when he finds out. You're doing the right thing. Everywhere I go, things get screwed up. You know, Helen used to feel exactly the same way. How do you know she still doesn't? I mean, sometimes, I pretend things are better even when they're not. [footsteps approaching] Philip, are you absolutely sure that Lukas threw the gun in this pond? Yes. You don't believe me, do you? No, I do. We're just not finding anyth... I know it's in there. I've seen it. Hey, we believe you. We do. No. No, she thinks I'm making this up. He just needs to know that you're still looking. [car doors opens] Agent Kane was looking for you at the sheriff's station. I figured you'd be out here a while, so I brought him along. Hi. I'm, uh, Helen's husband, Gabe. Gabe, this is Agent Kane. Ryan. Oh, Ryan. Excuse me. Okay. What's up, Gabe? You all right, man? You were looking for me? So what are we looking for? A gun. Whose gun? Mithat's. You coming to tell me I could arrest him? He's dead. What? Shot in the head in the park yesterday. Who shot him? Don't have any leads yet. But this puts your case to bed, Helen. Mithat gets killed, and that's as good as a conviction for you? Would be for most cops. Seriously, Helen, what is the point in finding a dead man's gun? I need to confirm that Mithat was responsible for those shootings at the cabin. The case is closed, Helen. Are you really gonna let it follow you? If there's a gun, I'm gonna find it. And if not? I'll find something else. Okay. Say, who tipped you off about the gun, anyway? Some hikers saw it. Okay. I just wanted to tell you about Mithat myself. I appreciate the gesture. You know, if you ever need a liaison, I'm... I'm, uh, Helen's right-hand guy. Or partner. I mean, whichever... Like, I mean, if... if you can't get in touch with her about the case. The case is closed. It's closed? Maybe on the next one, huh? Before this, there hasn't been a murder here in, like, 100 years. Guess I won't be seeing you for a while, then. [car door closes] I guess not. [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [breathing heavily] Philip told me you were in your family's cabin the night of the shootings. [tense music] He told me about the gun; that you threw it in the water and covered it with rocks because you were frightened. ♪ ♪ He's lying. So nothing Philip told me is true? ♪ ♪ Besides throwing rocks in the water. We'd done that a couple times. ♪ ♪ Why would he lie about this? I don't know. ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] [birds caw] [birds and insects chirping] What's this? Size 9 1/2, right? I already have riding boots. Oh, those babies aren't for riding. They're for dancing. What kind of dancing? It's George Jones Vinyl Night, remember? Tonight? Case closed, bad guy dead, husband gets to two-step with his baby. [exhales slowly] No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, yes. [laughing] Please, no. [laughs] Hey, good morning. Did you grab some breakfast? What? It's safe. Gabe made the pancakes. Mm-hmm. Sorry. I forgot I got to make up a quiz before school starts, so I got to run. Okay. I meant what I said, Philip. I believe you. It doesn't matter what Lukas said. I'm gonna follow up and find that gun. Mm-hmm. Pick you up after school? Um, maybe. [sighs] Hey, wh... what do you mean? You were gonna look into the gun? I thought the investigation was over. It is. So why keep looking? I'm not. I'm not, really. I just want him to know that we believe him and not Lukas. Okay, good. You had me worried for a moment. [soft music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [sniffles] [keyboard key clicks] [quietly] Here. What aren't you telling us, Kami? Nothing. [sighs] She wanted to get out of town with Jake. I really thought I got to her. Angel, he was coming on pretty hard. There is nothing Sita cares about more than her baby. She had to have been forced into this. She planted heroin in your house. Now she's killed the valley's biggest dealer. We need to initiate a search. Bring her in ASAP. Kami, you have to recuse yourself. It's an open case now. I don't want you near it. All right? Yeah, I know. Burlingame, you're up. Look, you can't contact Sita. If she reaches out, you come straight to me. Yeah? ♪ ♪ Have you ever loved anyone so much that you would risk everything? Once. [cell phone ringing] Go on. [cell phone beeps] This is Kane. Hi. Yeah, look, just to be clear, this is a confidential FBI inquiry into a detective that worked with you five years ago. Helen Torrance. [school bell rings] [indistinct chatter] Lukas, stop. I need to talk to you, please. We've talked enough. I tried to tell you last night, but Helen was... Hey, baby. Hey, you.

You want to get out of here? Not really. Yeah. I could sit here all night. You don't want to go home? Gabe wants to take me dancing. What's wrong with that? Nothing, but I've been avoiding it for three years. Why? Honestly, [whispers] I'm not very good. That's actually, like, the one thing that my mom loves more than her drugs. She loves you. Okay. The one thing that she loves more than her drugs and me, is to go out dancing. [soft music] Sometimes, her boyfriend would pick her up, and instead of going on a binge, he'll take her out to this Russian club, drop a couple hundred dollars. [chuckles] I'd always wait up to see her when she got back, 'cause that's when she seemed the happiest. ♪ ♪ I bet Billy will try to break her out of rehab, take her dancing. [chuckles softly] Hmm... We can get out of here. I'm kind of hungry. [light acoustic music] [both laugh] I can't remember the last time I stayed out all night. [grunts] See you later, folks. Thank you. Thanks so much. Bye-bye. [laughs] Hey, hey. Come here, come here, come here. [laughs] ♪ ♪ Can I tell you something, babe? Right here, right now with you... ... Amidst the grass and the rising sun? ... amidst the grass and the rising sun. I got you, and we got Philip. [sighs] I'm just happy. I have a few updates for you about our dear Philip. No need to bring the kid up during foreplay. Is this foreplay? Mmm. Then what are we still doing standing in the mud? Mm, mm... oh! [yelps and laughs] [grunts] [both laugh] Tell me that looked awesome. Babe, it looks badass. Wh... what the hell is this? It's you jumping. You completely missed my air. Do you want me to try again? It doesn't matter. You don't know how to shoot it right. Baby, what's wrong? Is it your knee? Is it still hurting? Yeah, it... Does your mom have any more of those painkillers? I gave you four yesterday. You finished them all already? Yeah. [soft dramatic music] [sighs] I might have a couple left over. I'll give 'em to you at my party. Mm. [laughs] Mm. ♪ ♪ How was the water? It was pretty awesome. He still hasn't been out on the water yet. We have fun on the dock. Listen, I know the two of you have gotten close. We were wrong, Gabe. Lukas wasn't lying. It was Philip. Well, uh, if he's lying, it's because he still feels intimidated. No, he's lying to you too. Oh, really? That's where you want to take it. Yeah. You know that story he told you about his mom's old boyfriend overdosing on a couch? Yeah. Well, that never happened. He played you so he wouldn't get in trouble for ditching that... That's exactly why he tells me things and not you. And Billy, the ex-boyfriend? Oh, so you brought him back from the dead for an interrogation? No. Billy's not dead. I called Anne. Oh, God damn it, Helen. And apparently, this is a pattern for Philip and... Why are you doing this? Why? Because you asked me to trust him, and I did, and he lied about the gun, and he lied about the overdose. That yellow couch was there. Hey, Philip, you can leave that. I'm gonna take the boat out for a bit. You're gonna go out by yourself? Yeah. Is everything all right? Mm-hmm. [engine sputters and starts] [Kevin Morby's "Singing Saw"] ♪ ♪ 
♪ Up the hill ♪ 
♪ Laughing at me ♪ 
♪ He went ♪ 
♪ ♪ [together] ♪ Cutting down a willow ♪ 
♪ ♪ [indistinct whisper] ♪ ♪ If you've read Helen's psych eval, there's nothing else I can add. Well, what about the missing pages? Right. We believe she stole them. I'm sorry, boss, but you're not gonna believe this. Excuse me, Doctor. Burlingame got word on Sita? No, she's still off the grid with Angel Vescovi, but there's new movement on the drug deal. Who stepped up? Vick. Mithat's driver's running his crew. American dream. Yeah. Be ready to brief me in ten. Great. [phone rings] Do you recall what, uh... what was in those pages? That's client privilege. I understand. but Helen's working with my task force, and I'm a little concerned with some of her recent behavior. Anything in particular? Well, she refused to move on from a solved case. She won't stop looking for a gun that doesn't exist. She was one of the good ones. Her performance was outstanding, but after the incident in Buffalo, she developed obsessive tendencies. If she believes there's unseen evidence, I doubt she'll stop looking for it. I understand. Was there an exit interview?  No. She just boxed up her murder board and walked away. Do you think she destroyed it? The box? Not Helen. I'm sure she keeps it stored away somewhere and only brings it out when she wants to punish herself. [dramatic music] [soft music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 Morning. Hi. So I guess we're back to coning again, huh? I guess so. Hey, you know when someone dumps you, and you just can't... get yourself to take their picture down? What's going on, Tony?

Wow, this is even more quaint than I pictured it. [sighs] Just unwinding in the country? No. I'm looking for you, actually. What's up? Did you hear about Sita? No. But I heard Mithat got shot. Well, hearing about Mithat is hearing about Sita. [soft dramatic music] Do you want to know what the hardest part is? This is the first time that I can't help her. Many would've stopped a long time ago. Thanks. You have any idea where she might be hiding out? Nope, and the FBI won't let me look. They think I'll try and tip her off. You can't really blame them, can you? Yeah, but you want to know what the truth is? I actually want her to get caught, because at least if she's locked up, I will know she's safe. If Jake is with her during the arrest, he goes straight to social services. I know that, but I can't get anywhere near them without the FBI tipping them off. I'm pretty sure Burlingame is tracking all my moves. No one's tracking my moves. ♪ ♪ [melancholy music] You think you can ride it with a... hey, what are you doing? Hey, please, no photos.

Now, Philip is not the right kind of friend for you. He's not my friend. All right, now, maybe, but he's caused you a lot of trouble, and if, uh, he keeps dragging you through the mud, this sponsorship could disappear. Do you understand that? Yeah. Yes, I understand that. All right. [laughs softly] Oh, man. Congratulations, son. Well done. Thanks, Dad. Dad, oh, my God. Whoo! [cell phone buzzes] [quietly] Oh, man. I didn't want to tell you about Philip. But you did. Yeah, you needed to know. Fine. You know, this morning, I was pissed at you... Really, at me? [chuckles] ... and Philip, but, I mean, we can choose to stay mad, and that would be fair. Right? More than fair. But, you know, after Philip told me about his mother's boyfriend, we got closer after that. I think that's what this is about, babe. He lied about a murder weapon. I've arrested people for that. Well, maybe that's just his way of... trying to get close to you. [footsteps approaching] I finished cleaning out the shed. Where are you going? I'm just gonna go on a little walk. Okay, but you need to be back in 20 minutes, in time for dinner. Who's coming over? Bo and Lukas. Wait. Why? Because we think you need to apologize. Uh, for what?

I'm sorry, Lukas, for making up the story that you saw the murders and had the gun. Do you accept the apology, Lukas? Yeah, sure. Okay, and from now on, we're gonna need, uh, Philip to keep his distance from Lukas. We agreed that an apology would be enough. Well, it's not. From the start, Philip has been a bad influence. May... may I be excused? No. I have that party. Let's not go making false accusations here. No, no, your boy's made enough of those. Lukas, are you absolutely certain you've been entirely truthful with Helen? [soft music] ♪ ♪ No. What, Lukas? What happened? Philip... he made me steal from my dad to buy drugs. ♪ ♪ What?
