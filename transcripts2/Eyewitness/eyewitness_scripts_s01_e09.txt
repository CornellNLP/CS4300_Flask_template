Everything's under control. Is he going to be okay? He's not doing so great, but he's stable. I didn't compromise our location. Someone must have. [indistinct chatter] It doesn't really matter how hard you try. You can't... can't change who you are. What do you mean? I mean... everyone I'm close to gets messed up, and now... [somber music] .. now it's Lukas. Hey. That's not how it works. It's not about you. Really? Yeah. Then what about you and Helen? [elevator dings] What about us? ♪ ♪ I'll be right back. ♪ ♪ Hey. Hi. So, how's Lukas? We still don't know if he's going to wake up. But the doctor said it could help to hear familiar voices. Philip really wants to see him. You've got him pretty close. You can say that. How is it we haven't spoken about this? It just hasn't come up. I guess. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] [monitors beeping] ♪ ♪ Hey. Hey. Hi. What's the prognosis? They got him stable, but he's in a coma. And they're moving him to an ICU. You know this could have happened on anyone's watch, right? Yeah, but it didn't. You speak to the family yet? No, it's just his dad. He's rounding up his friends. That's him. Do you want an interview? No. I got to get back to the office. Call you later. ♪ ♪ [sirens wailing distantly] [solemn music] ♪ ♪ Go on, get this boy out of here. Easy, Bo. Now. He has every right to be here. They're friends. Has it ever occurred to you that ever since Philip showed up... Oh, you're going to go there? Tell me I don't have a point. You don't. Listen, Bo, I know you're hurting, but let's not do this here. [sighs] Come on. ♪ ♪ [sniffles] ♪ ♪ Is he going to be okay? They don't know. They just asked me to talk to him. Even though I know he doesn't want to hear from me.

Can I have you step out for a moment? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. [dark music] Can you give me a minute? Yeah. I appreciate you listening the other day. Here I thought I was the one that did most of the talking. I've never... talked to anyone like that before. It's not every day you run into someone who gets where you've been. Oh, yeah. Me neither. So, why did you come, Ryan? Is there anything I should know? This happened on Kami's watch. I need to make a report. It's the same guy we've been after. It has to be.

Makes your job easier. ♪ ♪ [sighs] Keep me updated on his status. What? What? That man is the sh1t. Tony, I have to ask you something. What's up? Did you tell anyone where the FBI had Lukas? No. No? Helen, I didn't tell anyone where he was. Bo's farm is huge, and yet this guy knew exactly how to find him. So, how did the shooter get Lukas's location unless it was a leak? We should... maybe get out hands on Kamilah's phone records. Kamilah? ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] [birds caw] [bird squawks distantly] [horses whinny] He's not a perp, Helen. He's a teenager who's in love and he's hurting. You don't think I know that? Is there any news on Lukas? Not yet. They're just waiting for him to wake up. He will. I know he will. Philip, I need you to tell me a few things for Lukas's safety. Why don't we wait and have pancakes first? Why don't we eat and talk at the same time? Did you tell anyone that Lukas had FBI security? The only kid that I talk to is Lukas. Philip, I've been doing this way too long... Helen. What? There's been a security breach. The guy I'm after shot Lukas. So, whatever you're hiding from me, I need you to tell me now, okay? Philip. [knock at door] Please. [clears throat] I'm not hiding anything. [whispering] Phone records... [indistinct whispering] [whispering] That's okay... Can you please take me to see my mom? Yeah. Sure. [whispering continues] I'll meet you outside, okay? I have to go. [door closes] You might be solving the murders, but you're destroying this family. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [monitors beep] [solemn music] ♪ ♪ I brought some clothes. When you wake up, you can head straight home. ♪ ♪ I know we haven't been connecting, Lukas. ♪ ♪ I even worry that the sound of my voice... could actually do damage. ♪ ♪ Honey, I know that I haven't been well, but you should have told me sooner. I wanted to. It's just... it's been so crazy. Is Lukas getting better? Yeah, that's what they said. Look, honey, if you come forward now and tell them what you saw, they're going to take you away. I don't want to have to lie anymore. I know. You're building a life with these people. And Gabe said that you could stay with them after you age out, right? Yeah. It means they care about you. They want you to be with them. Honey, don't risk losing that. ♪ ♪ That little town next to their farm, it's like a little piece of heaven. Helen told me that they named a whole type of school of painting after that place. The Hudson River School. How'd you know that? I just remembered. ♪ ♪ What about you? I've been good. Yeah, I've been real good. Yeah. They give you visitation. That's a good sign, right? Mm-hmm. And phone privileges. That's really good, Mom. That's really good. ♪ ♪ [dark music] ♪ ♪ [vehicle approaching] ♪ ♪ Hey, I've been looking for you. Hey. Uh, can it wait? I'm in the final stages of my bust. It won't take long. Please. How exactly did you get your hands on FBI phone records? Tony has friends in low places. You seriously think Kamilah of all people leaked his location? No. Then why are you showing me her phone records? I'm trying to prove it wasn't her. [sighs] You don't even know there was a leak. All I know is that Kamilah was supposed to be the only one who knew where Lukas was. I think it could be internal from your end. Maybe someone hacked into her phone. Maybe her number, too. But we're not going to know until you... investigate your team. Okay. Really? Yes. [cell phone buzzes] I just got to wait till after my raid. Does that work? Yeah. We're going to get this guy. ♪ ♪ Good-looking kid. It's Philip, my foster son. He's probably checking in on Lukas. They're friends. Hmm. [dark music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I don't want this investigation to hurt our family. And I know I can seem cold. And I'm not. And... and I don't want to be. That's not how I feel. But in my life some things have happened that have just... Hey. You are a city cop. We can't even imagine. And I would never want to burden you with that. But at some point, I just... I stopped being able to... [solemn music] ♪ ♪ Philip, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not trusting you, and I'm really sorry for not letting you in. [sighs] ♪ ♪ [clears throat] Excuse me. Um... Helen... I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. [sobbing softly] It's okay. ♪ ♪ I'm sorry to interrupt family time. That's all right. Are you okay? Lukas had this. I gave it to him for good luck. I found it in his pocket. The MRI came back clean. So I think he's going to be okay. Oh, thank God. [sighs] That's great. Can I offer you something? No, I, uh... I just want to ask Philip. No, no, that's all done. I thought about it. Sometimes a man's got to admit when he's wrong. Lukas still needs to hear from his friends. I know you two were tight. Well, it would mean a lot to me if you would come to the hospital. ♪ ♪ Yeah, you just want me to come and talk to him? About whatever you two talk about. ♪ ♪ I mean, is there any music that he likes? ♪ ♪ Yeah, I think I know what he'd want to hear. [dark music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ I'm my own best friend ♪ 
♪ And my worst enemy ♪ [door sliding open] ♪ We get on like a house on fire ♪

I just wanted to sit here with you for a minute. Okay. Sometimes when you meet late in life, things get left out, right? You had a life. I had a life. None of that matters now. It does matter. I want you to understand why I've been acting this way. Okay. [solemn music] [exhales] As long as the lid is on this box, I'm safe. It's pretty convenient, right? You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. ♪ ♪ When I met you, it was the first time I thought that maybe this box didn't exist. And I love that feeling. The past isn't important. In this case, it is. ♪ ♪ Helen, what is it? This... this... this guy I'm after, he's playing some kind of game with me. What are you talking about? That box has been tampered with. No. I chased him off the property. No. Helen, no one is watching you. I think he is watching us. Helen... No, he is, Gabe, I'm serious. Helen, it was me! [gasps] It was me. What? ♪ ♪ What? I found your key. You went to my storage unit? I did. But for what it's worth, I opened the box, but... I didn't look inside. ♪ ♪ [scoffs] ♪ ♪ I drove up here to... down these... with some vodka. ♪ ♪ And then I met you. ♪ ♪ I'm so sorry. [sniffles] ♪ ♪ I'm so sorry. ♪ ♪ [somber music] ♪ ♪ [bike whirring over video] Do you hear that, Lukas? That's you. That's you riding, Lukas. Can you hear it? I love you, Lukas. Please wake up. ♪ ♪
