 You're awake.   
 Every time I visit, he's asleep.   
 [SARCASTICALLY] I wonder why.   
 - EVE: Did the doctors come by? 
- MACIEK: They did.   
 [RESPIRATOR HISSING]    
 And?    
 MACIEK: And he getting better.    
 But he must avoid all stress.    
 You're stress.    
 Coming from you, Maciek, that's pretty rich.    
 The first time I meet you,    
 I tell him, "Don't marry her.    
 "She will be great big ball-ache.    
 - "She will make your life a total nightmare." 
- [TAPPING]    
 It's so good to see your eyes.    
 I am gonna find out why this happened to you.    
 And I promise you...

 [IN ENGLISH] Welcome.    
 [CHUCKLES]    
 Let's sit over there, shall we?    
 It's more comfortable.    
 [GLASS CLINKING]    
 I've wanted to meet you for a long time.    
 I've been watching you.    
 Er, watching in a kinky way?    
 You're remarkable.    
 Are you trying to seduce me?    
 [MOBILE PHONE BUZZING]    
 Excuse me.    
 [IN FRENCH] _    
 [IN ENGLISH] What is your name?    
 Helene.    
 Helene.    
 Is that your real name?    
 Do you know why I wanted to meet you in person?    
 To watch me some more?    
 I wanted to tell you face to face that your request has been successful.    
 [CORK POPS]    
 It's official.    
 [VILLANELLE CHUCKLES]    
 [BOTH LAUGH]    
 To Villanelle, the Keeper.    
 [BOTH LAUGH]    
 [EXHALES SHARPLY]    
 Your first assignment in your new role is very exciting.    
 A big job that will cause a great stir.    
 A politician in Romania.    
 [SETS DOWN GLASS]    
 I was told I would be giving orders.    
 By who?    
 This is the same stuff I was doing before.    
 This is bullshit.    
 You bargained for what you wanted, and we're giving it to you.    
 You'll get all the material perks you were expecting.    
 What more do you want?    
 Enjoy Romania.    
 JAMIE: So, if the texts weren't from Niko...    
 Villanelle must have sent them.    
 Making Eve go to Poland to see...    
 Her husband being pitchforked.    
 Sorry.    
 JAMIE: Which means Villanelle is...    
 Stark raving mad.    
 This can't be about the bus.    
 What bus?    
 What did you do on the bus?    
 She knows she can't touch him.    
 JAMIE: What's she saying here?    
 Er, she's saying she's "still got it."    
 Actually, if she still did have it, he'd be dead and not just pitchforked.    
 Sorry.    
 Maybe she's trying to torture you.     
 Not like this.     
 Am I being too harsh?     
 Wait, what's this?     
 JAMIE: Bertha Kruger.     
 The wife of Charles, the, er, accountant for The Twelve.     
 Killed in Lyon.     
 - EVE: When? 
- BEAR: Last week, when you were gone.     
 [RATTLING]     
 [SIGHS IN IRRITATION]     
 [THUDDING]     
 BEAR: Are you okay?     
 I just want a muffin.     
 [THUDS]     
 No one usually gets those.     
 Ugh. Yeah.     
 Jan,     .     
 Here.     
 [COINS JINGLE]     
 [BEEPING]     
 You know that it would be okay if you're not okay.     
 That is...     
 [SIGHS]     
 I mean, aside from Kenny dying which, let's face it, is a bit of a blow.     
 - [SIGHS] 
- And being lured to Poland because you thought your husband wanted you back, when really it was just to see him being punctured.     
 [LOUD THUD]     
 You're alone, homeless, and trying to figure out     
 - who's killed all your friends. 
- [GRUNTS]     
 I mean, I'd be a total wreck.     
 [GROANS] Why won't you give me a break?     
 - Sometimes you just need to let it win.

 [SIGHS]     
 [THUDS]     
 [WRAPPER CRINKLES]     
 Hmm.     
 I wanted to show you this.     
 Dasha Duzran.     
 That's who's responsible for the '  s gymnast kill.     
 At least, that's what all the rumors say.     
 Who is she?     
 An Olympic gymnast, who supposedly works for the KGB.     
 They say it was The Chalk Kill that got her recruited.     
 Why would Villanelle imitate her?     
 Flattery and all that.     
 Hardly.     
 - Where is this? 
- Oh, that's in Barcelona.     
 Yeah. She teaches wee kids to do roly-polies.     
 [CHUCKLES] Wha-what?     
 [GRUNTS]     
 [DOORBELL RINGING]     
 [EXHALES]     
 Eve.     
 Tell me everything about Dasha Duzran.     
 CAROLYN: I'm afraid you've interrupted a rather delicate operation.     
 Drought can be endured, but rot is an instant killer.     
 Dasha.     
 Oh, yes.     
 Well, I first met her when she had just been kicked out of the KGB.     
 Sorrento.     
 And the weather was unusually hot for that time of year, and I waited for her at a cafe.     
 And before she sat down, she plucked a lemon from a tree, and took the most enormous bite out of it, rind and all.     
 Why do you want to know?     
 I think she's running Villanelle out of Barcelona.     
 Well, that is a heady combination.     
 Villanelle and Dasha. Volatile.     
 If I'm right, Dasha knows where Villanelle was last week.     
 Because, I don't think she was the one who attacked Niko.     
 Interesting.     
 I think she was in Lyon at the time, killing Bertha Kruger.     
 I hope that doesn't mean you're thinking of going to Barcelona.     
 Someone tried to kill my husband, I intend to find out who.     
 But if it's The Twelve, Eve...     
 Does it really matter who?     
 I could say the same about Kenny.     
 Just be very careful of Dasha.     
 She was the KGB's top assassin, until she killed one of their own.     
 [CHUCKLES] I mean, that's why she was exiled.

 KONSTANTIN: [IN ENGLISH] 
What are you doing?     
 VILLANELLE: I love hockey! Irina's good.     
 - That was the other team. 
- It is?     
 - Yes. 
- Oh.     
 Go, other team!     
 Villanelle.     
 Do they sell hot dogs here?     
 You can't watch sports     
 - without a hot dog. 
- Villanelle!     
 What is going on?     
 I'm coming with you.     
 Your plan to get out? I'm in.     
 - You're in? 
- It's exciting, huh?     
 How was your trip?     
 Er, turns out I'm excellent at dung-throwing.     
 [PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY]     
 And your mother?     
 [WHISTLE BLOWING]     
 [BREATHING UNEVENLY]     
 No, Villanelle.     
 [VOICE SHAKING] She deserved it.     
 Of course, she deserved it.     
 Everyone's mother deserves it.     
 But you're not supposed to do it.     
 [STERNLY] You are supposed to grow up     
 - and realize she isn't actually evil. 
- I don't want to talk about it.     
 - I don't want to talk about it! 
- She's just insane.     
 [CHUCKLES] Where are we going?     
 It better be someplace hot.     
 - No, it's too late. 
- You haven't even left.     
 It's too dangerous for us all to go together.     
 Konstantin, please.     
 [WHISTLE BLOWING]     
 I send for you.     
 Er, no.     
 No.     
 We can't go together.     
 They will be on to us before we get there.     
 - Get where? 
- You will know when I send for you.     
 Hmm, we'll go.     
 Then, you can send for Irina.     
 [CLICKS TONGUE] I can't do that.     
 Once we're safe, you'll come. I promise.     
 I don't believe you.     
 But that's the only way we'll make it.     
 You haven't told anyone about this, have you?     
 - [WHISTLE BLOWING] 
- [PEOPLE CHEERING]     
 Of course not.     
 Don't let them see you even think about getting out.     
 Do you hear me?     
 They'd kill you the second they realize...     
 [IN RUSSIAN] _     
 Oh, Irina.     
 [ANGRILY SPEAKS IN ENGLISH] Because of her.     
 I just scored in the final minute, and you missed it.     
 That was good.     
 He's a really sh1t father. 
You should run away.     
 What is she doing here?     
 Er, I'm planning our travel arrangements.     
 - Please tell me you're joking. 
- She is joking.     
 - I'm not going if she's with us. 
- Great!     
 Problem solved. When do we leave?     
 Irina, you go and get changed.     
 We'll talk about this later.     
 - [SCOFFS] 
- Go.     
 KONSTANTIN: I don't think you really want this.     
 I want it! [EXHALES]     
 You know what it means?     
 It means you have to leave everything, the clothes, apartment... and her.     
 I know.     
 Don't let them see something's up.     
 Promise me.     
 The plan only works if nobody knows there is one.     
 I'll act totally normal.     
 Then they'd definitely know something's up.     
 [BIRDS CHIRPING]     
 Are you coming to poker this week?     
 What day is it?     
 Wednesday.     
 This Wednesday.     
 [MOBILE PHONE CLICKING]     
 I'm afraid I don't think I can.     
 That's a shame.     
 Shirley's making her risotto.     
 - Mushroom? 
- Naturally.     
 Well, let me see what I can do.     
 Right. To the matter at hand.     
 Phone records.     
 Calls to and from Kenny's work phone     
 - the two days before he... 
- Died.     
 Was he working for you around this time?     
 [YAWNS] No.     
 He'd left the service by then.     
 It's just...     
 There were several incoming and outgoing calls to a Russian number.     
 Anyway, I'll leave you to go over it all.     
 Give me a shout if you have any questions.     
 Thanks, Mike.     
 I emailed this to your desk over a week ago, you know.     
 Really?     
 That's why I suggested this when you asked where they were.     
 Didn't want them to get lost.     
 Let me know about Wednesday.     
 You have to let us win it back sometime, you know.     
 [KNOCK ON DOOR]     
 Ah! Hello, Carolyn.     
 Time for P.E.?     
 [CHUCKLES] Indeed.     
 Do you think you could manage to get those phone records to me?     
 They're taking a very long time.     
 Hmm. I, er, had a call about those just this morning.     
 Scotland Yard dragging their feet, as per.     
 Shouldn't be too much longer.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 What?     
 Are you...     
 ... working for them, Paul?     
 Excuse me?     
 Are you?     
 Are you, Carolyn?     
 Why on Earth would you ask me that?     
 Well, the same reason you asked me.     
 Because we don't trust each other.     
 Should I...     
 ... trust you?     
 [CHUCKLES] Heavens, no.     
 None of us are to be trusted,     
 that's why we work here.     
 [CHUCKLES] Quite.     
 Well, I'd best be off, I have an appointment.     
 Right.     
 Carolyn.     
 This is your office.     
 Oh.     
 That's very good light.

 My mum's boyfriend.     
 Is he a pervert?     
 No. He's just...     
 ... really, really... nice.     
 You want to bunk off?     
 Do you think I'm dumb?     
 I'm not going anywhere with you.     
 Come on! It'll be fun.     
 We can do anything you want.     
 Anything.

 [LAUGHING]     
 You'll need me to help you translate.     
 I remember your languages were... 
[BLOWING RASPBERRY]     
 Piss off! I'm fluent in Spanish.     
 [MOCKING] Ooh, Spanish.     
 [VILLANELLE SPEAKS IN SPANISH]     
 IRINA: I know what you're trying to do.     
 You're not coming with us.     
 VILLANELLE: I bet you get homesick in a week.     
 - No, I won't. 
- The heat will be awful.     
 You'll have to wax all the time.     
 You're so old.     
 People don't just wax any more.     
 I don't want to look like a   -year-old girl.     
 You are a   -year-old girl.     
 [ANGRILY] I'm   !     
 [GRUMBLES]     
 Where is your Dad?     
 London.     
 So, you're stuck with your mum?     
 - Don't remind me. 
- Mums are the worst, right?     
 You know how annoying it is when you have to be around     
 - two people in love? 
- Ugh.     
 Well, imagine one of those people is your mum.     
 It's disgusting. He's disgusting.     
 If it's that bad, kill him.     
 [SARCASTICALLY] You're a real role model, you know that?     
 VILLANELLE: Oh, my God! You're really bad.     
 The humidity in South America will not be kind to that hair.     
 [ANGRILY] Cuba's in North America, you idiot!     
 Cuba!     
 [SHOUTS GLEEFULLY] Cuba!     
 [LAUGHS LOUDLY]     
 IRINA: You are totally delusional.     
 Shall we go for a drive?     
 Mmm.     
 This is nice.     
 Is it?     
 How are you?     
 - Galvanized. 
- [CHUCKLES] I can see that.     
 Are you in a rush?     
 Not rushed, just impatient.     
 Are we going somewhere in particular?     
 Yes.     
 Are you going to tell me where?     
 No.     
 [LAUGHING]     
 - What are you doing? 
- Give me your wallet.     
 - Why? 
- [STERNLY] Just give me your wallet.     
 KONSTANTIN: [SHOUTING] What the hell are you doing?     
 What did you want with my child?     
 I'm going to ask you again, Konstantin, and you're going to answer me correctly.     
 What did you want with my child?     
 I swear, I try nothing.     
 She kissed me.     
 [MUTTERING] Geri kissed you.     
 [REVVING]     
 KONSTANTIN: You don't have to do this.     
 I already know you are scary.     
 Why did Kenny call you the night before he died?     
 Konstantin?     
 - Konstantin? 
- Okay, okay. He called me.     
 - What did you get him into? 
- Nothing.     
 - If you don't tell me... 
- I don't know what this is, or what you're...     
 
 
 
 - [YELPS] 
- [TIRES SCREECH]     
 [HONKING]     
 [SCREAMS]     
 CAROLYN: Tell me.     
 He ask if I was his father.     
 Hey.     
 What did you tell him?     
 I told... I told him I didn't know.     
 [SIGHS]     
 [PUTS CAR GEAR IN PARK]     
 Get out.     
 [SEAT BELT CLICKS]     
 [CAR DOOR OPENS]     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 You're cooking.     
 I thought we were having veg stew tonight.     
 I really just felt like a pork pie, if I'm honest.     
 [SIGHS WITH FRUSTRATION] 
I went shopping specifically.     
 They're wonky.     
 The ones that no one wanted.     
 Geri, are you comparing yourself to a carrot?     
 - I know you don't like me very much... 
- Geri.     
 And now you have to put up with me because you and I are all that's left of this family, and...     
 I don't love being here either, having you treat me like I'm some kind of idiotic annoyance whose intellectual power could never match up to yours.     
 Could we do this after we've...     
 [VOICE SHAKING] But I choose to stay because...     
 Because you're all I have, too.     
 And I thought that maybe we'd learn to...     
 I don't know, do more than just tolerate each other.     
 It would be so much better if we could have this conversation after I've eaten.     
 All right.     
 [SIGHS] All right.     
 You were your father's.     
 [POURING]     
 And Kenny was mine.     
 And that is how things were when we were all alive.     
 [POURING]     
 He understood you and you him, in a way I never did.     
 And I understood Kenny and he me, in a way your father never did. So...     
 No.     
 You're not easy for me to understand.     
 [LAUGHS] And I know I'm not supposed to say that.     
 But it's the truth.     
 There's no more can be said about it.     
 Now, I can pretend to enjoy wonky carrot stew and listen to gong bells     
 and all the other inane things that interest you, but I don't, because I can't lie, do you see?     
 I know other parents do, they tell their children they're wonderful at this and great at that, but I just...     
 I don't have that gene.     
 So... [EXHALES]     
 To you, I am harsh and cold, and to me you are disappointed     
 - and expected. 
- [KNIFE THUDS]     
 Oh! [WINCES]     
 [GROANING]     
 Ooh.     
 [GROANING]     
 [WINCES]     
 But you're right, Geraldine.     
 All we've got left is each other.     
 So, you make your stew and I'll try and pretend to enjoy it.     
 And while I do, you can tell me exactly what's been going on between you and Konstantin.     
 Where you've been, what you've done, and why he came to visit you.     
 Because it seems while I've been unable to lie to you, you've had no problem lying to me.     
 [GROANS]     
 Call me when it's done.     
 [CLATTERS]     
 - PAUL: Where've you been? 
- [SCREAMING]     
 [ANGRILY] Will people stop waiting for me in the dark!     
 Bit late for an evening stroll.     
 [BREATHING HEAVILY]     
 I was trying to get my step-count up.     
 Hmm.     
 You know, it turns out Kruger wasn't the man we were after.     
 - No? [EXHALES] 
- No.     
 It was someone else who was dipping into the honey pot.     
 Then why make me stay here?     
 His wife, Bertha, she's our focus now.     
 Because she was stealing the funds?     
 No, because she's dead.     
 Whoever ordered that hit is who we want.     
 Do you have any idea who'd want that woman dead?     
 Why would I?     
 Does this mean I can leave London?     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 It means the job description's changed.     
 Find out who gave that order, whatever it takes.     
 If there's a breach, we're both to blame, but believe me, you will be the one who'll fall.     
 Up for a game?     
 You're up.     
 Total fluke.     
 So why you here?     
 You want to ask about my gold medals?     
 Oh, I thought it was bronze.     
 Do you know who I am?     
 I know you're working for The Twelve.     
 I know you're working with her.     
 Your turn.     
 You bowl a lot?     
 Never.     
 I noticed the way Villanelle copied your first kill.     
 Very original.     
 She must really admire you.     
 Though, whoever tried to imitate her did a really poor job.     
 My husband's still alive.     
 You don't talk to people when they are bowling.     
 That was a strike.     
 Did they send her to kill Kenny?     
 My God,     
 - is this what she has to deal with? 
- Where is she?     
 Just because you don't want it to be her,     
 - doesn't mean it wasn't. 
- It wasn't.     
 Do you know she's been promoted?     
 She will never be loyal to you.     
 - And she's loyal to you? 
- Aye, she respects me.     
 - [SARCASTICALLY] Really? 
- I created her.     
 I took raw sh1t and moulded it into steel.     
 I broke her back, I gave her wings.     
 She's perfect killing machine.     
 That's all she's there for. 
That's all she knows.     
 I don't think so.     
 Oh, you think she cares what you think?     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 She's moving up in the world.     
 You'll never touch her now.     
 You think you are winning.     
 You will never win at this game.     
 You can't beat us. You understand?     
 I can kill you... any time.     
 End of game.
