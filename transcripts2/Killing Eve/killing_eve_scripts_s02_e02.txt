 I know where you are. 
  - Come home, Eve, now! 
  - I think I might have killed her. 
  - How long have I been here? 
  - A man stabbed you? 
  - A woman stabbed me. 
  - No way out of this job. 
  - I'm so sorry. 
  - Just talk to me. 
  - Alister Peel. 
  - The Internet guy? 
  Really? 
  You think he was murdered. 
  You think it was Villanelle. 
  She's on the move. 
  Come on, Eve. 
  If she's alive, you need to find her. 
  What are you doing? 
  Um Are you shopping? 
  You really have changed. 
  The blue one's sexy. 
  Oi! 
  Oi! 
  This is not a homeless shelter. 
  Your laundry load is finished. 
  No, no, no, no, no No! 
  My medication has been stolen! 
  Hey! 
  Alister Peel. 
  - It's crazy. 
  - No matter how rich or famous you are, you always end up with your dick out on a slab. 
  I nearly threw up. 
  They had to get me a burger. 
  So you're not completely heartless. 
  Not yet. 
  And they think she did it? 
  That's why they want you in. 
  Maybe, yeah. 
  It's just to brief the Peel operation on Villanelle, I think. 
  I had a dream about Bill last night. 
  - Eve. 
  - His stupid little face. 
  I picked up my phone the other day to text him. 
  I'm sorry. 
  You know, let's not talk about this. 
  No, it's okay. 
  This is how it works, we have to talk. 
  Gross. 
  I want you to know that I hear you - and that I still respect you. 
  - Ew. 
  Mm. 
  Be careful. 
  What do you mean? 
  Uh you know, if you see something strange. 
  You know, be careful. 
  What a touchingly reassuring goodbye. 
  Sorry. 
  Come on. 
  Excuse me. 
  So sorry to bother you No, sorry, I don't have any change. 
  Excuse me. 
  Sorry, do you need to get past? 
  No, I need your help. 
  Oh, right. 
  I don't think I can That man out there, he's my stepfather. 
  He did this to me. 
  Oh. 
  Oh, dear. 
  I need someone to help me get out of here without him seeing. 
  If I could just walk behind you Gosh, I, Er - It's not my It's not my - Please. 
  Er Go on. 
  Alright. 
  Er just stay behind me. 
  Oh, yeah, just leave your stuff on the till, mate! 
  Don't worry about it! 
  Don't look at him. 
  He's completely lost his mind. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Oh, my God. 
  I don't think he saw us. 
  Thank you. 
  I don't know what I would have done. 
  Well, here you go. 
  A handkerchief, wow! 
  You're such a gentleman. 
  Oh, I don't know about that. 
  Do you have someone you need to call? 
  Is there anything I can do to help? 
  I've nowhere to go. 
  No friends? 
  I don't really have any. 
  There must be something I can do to help. 
  I can't just leave you here. 
  I'll be alright. 
  Look, er I have a spare room, er er if you need somewhere for a night or two. 
  No, I couldn't. 
  Thank you. 
  It wouldn't be right. 
  I would If you're worried, I would never What I mean is, you'd be completely safe, of course. 
  But wouldn't I be an inconvenience to you? 
  No, not at all. 
  "Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. 
  " But that would make me an angel. 
  Yeah, I suppose it would. 
  Your name? 
  Eve Polastri. 
  - Alright? 
  - Yeah. 
  How do you always look so good? 
  I mean, do you even sleep? 
  It's my moisturizer. 
  It's made of pig's placenta. 
  It costs a fortune and smells like arse but it is exceedingly effective. 
  I don't mind smelling like arse. 
  I'll send you the link. 
  What have you told these guys my role is, exactly? 
  - Outside expert. 
  - Expert on what? 
  Female assassins. 
  - Hi, Eve. 
  - Kenny! 
  - I didn't know you'd be here. 
  - Oh. 
  No, it's It's okay. 
  Now that Villanelle is part of the Peel investigation, I thought it might be useful to keep the Trafalgar Team intact. 
  Will Elena be Elena felt the job was no longer for her. 
  She's worried about getting murdered. 
  - Okay. 
  - Would you like to sit here? 
  - Are you alright? 
  - No. 
  - Hi. 
  Jess. 
  - Hi. 
  Hi. 
  Welcome to Operation Manderley. 
  This is Hugo - dogsbody and total Cambridge posh boy. 
  Apologies for him in advance. 
  Oxford, actually. 
  Just pretends not to remember to hurt my feelings. 
  She's very undermining. 
  Let me know if there's anything you need. 
  Welcome to M. 
  I. 
  6. 
  An Old Etonian around every corner waiting to steal your job. 
  Oh, Julian, wow! 
  My mother collected them. 
  - I should throw them away. 
  - No. 
  They're lovely. 
  Sit up straight, Annabelle. 
  We have a guest. 
  Could I possibly sit down? 
  Of course. 
  You must be tired. 
  Yes. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Can I get you anything? 
  Do you have any cake? 
  Oh, Er no. 
  But I could get you some. 
  Honestly, you've done enough. 
  Lemon drizzle. 
  I'll be back in ten minutes. 
  Eve? 
  What happened? 
  Mom said you went to Paris I'm so glad to see you. 
  - Are you two having an affair? 
  - Yeah. 
  I found her. 
  I found Villanelle. 
  - What? 
  Where is she? 
  - Kenny, I I stabbed her. 
  - What? 
  What! 
  - Ssh! 
  Oh, my God, Eve! 
  Is she dead? 
  I don't know. 
  I don't know. 
  She disappeared. 
  Ohh. 
  - This is really bad. 
  - I know. 
  - Does Mom know? 
  - Think I should tell her? 
  No! 
  No. 
  You're withholding information on an investigation that you're working on. 
  Well, on the bright side now you are too. 
  Oi, lovebirds! 
  Jess wants to hear the assassin briefing. 
  So, I am Eve Po Polastri. 
  I'm just Ohh. 
  I'm just gonna talk a little bit about - Do you need a hand? 
  - No, no, I'm I'm fine. 
  Um - You just press um this one. 
  - Yes. 
  And then Thank you, Hugo. 
  I can work a remote. 
  Yes, miss. 
  Yes, um So, originally our team was set up to look into a string of international assassinations. 
  Cesare Greco, Carla De Mann, Zhang Wu. 
  There didn't seem to be a whole lot connecting them except for this female assassin: Oksana Astankova . 
  . 
  or as she prefers to be called . 
  . 
  Villanelle. 
  Her handler was this man, Konstantin Vasiliev, F. 
  S. 
  B. 
  agent who moonlighted for the criminal organization that hired her. 
  She shot Konstantin in a tearoom full of people. 
  - She's sloppy? 
  - No, not usually. 
  She's flamboyant. 
  And attention-seeking. 
  And instinctive. 
  Spoilt. 
  Easily bored. 
  But, no. 
  She's not sloppy. 
  Frank Haleton. 
  He was in a government safe house when she murdered him. 
  That's Bill Pargrave. 
  She stabbed him to death on a nightclub dancefloor. 
  If anyone says, "It's murder on the dancefloor," I will throw them out the window. 
  Elizabeth? 
  Everything alright? 
  Do you need anything? 
  No, thank you, Julian. 
  Hello, this is Eve Polastri, Project Manderley. 
  I need to see all the crime-scene photos you have from the Paris hospital murder yesterday. 
  Can you email them through? 
  Yes, it's urgent. 
  I think I might need some antibiotics. 
  What you need is rest. 
  You'll be right as rain tomorrow. 
  But I get tonsillitis. 
  It could get infected. 
  Open your mouth. 
  Say ahh. 
  Ahh. 
  No white spots. 
  Little worry wort. 
  You'll feel better in the morning, I promise. 
  Now get some rest. 
  - Like a hottie bottie? 
  - A what? 
  A hot water bottle. 
  - I don't think so. 
  - Okay. 
  Stop! 
  Stop! 
  That's my mother. 
  What? 
  I I thought Come on. 
  Come on, Mommy, it's alright. 
  - It's alright. 
  - What's wrong with her? 
  Dementia. 
  Thank God. 
  I thought I thought she was a ghost. 
  I hate ghosts. 
  I should have warned you. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Why do you lock her in? 
  She kept leaving the house in the night and getting lost. 
  So it's safer for her this way. 
  - Okay. 
  Good night. 
  - Good night. 
  - Julian. 
  - How are you feeling? 
  I need you to call the doctor. 
  Tell him I need Tigecycline or or Cefepime. 
  - What are those? 
  - And I I need some things from the pharmacy. 
  I wrote you a list last night. 
  Uh "Antiseptic aspirin Ibuprofen" Someone's a hypochondriac. 
  You know, I should leave. 
  You've already been so kind. 
  No, please don't. 
  Of course I'll go to the pharmacy. 
  I have to pick up some things for Mom anyway. 
  "Sanitary pads. 
  " Ooh. 
  That'll cause a bit of a stir at the pharmacy. 
  I'll have to tell them they're for my girlfriend. 
  Do you want to talk about it? 
  No. 
  Maybe. 
  What do you know about psychopaths? 
  I went to boarding school. 
  So what does this look like to you? 
  This particular murder. 
  A heart attack caused by air injected under the toenail. 
  - Discreet. 
  - Right, right. 
  It's subtle boring. 
  Boring? 
  Relatively, yes. 
  Villanelle is an attention-seeker. 
  Most psychopaths are. 
  She likes playing to the gallery. 
  She wants it to be fun. 
  She wants people to know when she's killed someone. 
  - She wants me to know. 
  - You? 
  Whoever. 
  People. 
  - It wasn't her. 
  - It wasn't her. 
  How are my two girls? 
  I wouldn't trust her with a dead rat. 
  I hate this show. 
  Horrible. 
  Julian, I need you to go to the pharmacy. 
  Can we maybe open a window? 
  It's so hot! 
  I don't think that's a very good idea with your fever. 
  Look at your hair. 
  It's all messy. 
  Silly. 
  There. 
  There. 
  Nice and neat. 
  - Hello, dear. 
  - Oh, God. 
  How lovely to see you again. 
  Are you faking it? 
  How's Deb? 
  Deb got fat. 
  Oh, dear, what a shame. 
  Shame. 
  You will be careful of Julian, won't you? 
  What? 
  He's a good boy, really. 
  What do you mean? 
  Hey. 
  Hey! 
  Come back. 
  You're kidding me? 
  What do you mean? 
  One of the richest men in the world lives in this house? 
  Hello, are the family inside? 
  They are. 
  Go ahead, ma'am. 
  Close your mouth, Eve. 
  It's not exactly Versailles, is it? 
  Not what you were expecting? 
  Oh, I'm so sorry. 
  That's alright. 
  People are always surprised. 
  He used to walk past this house on his way to school every morning. 
  Said it was the nicest house he'd ever seen. 
  So when he made his first million he bought it. 
  And never left. 
  That's awesome. 
  Awesome? 
  Let's get this over and done with, shall we? 
  Amber? 
  Hello. 
  You said there was something about Dad? 
  Yes. 
  We've come here with rather difficult news. 
  - What, has he died again? 
  - Aaron. 
 
 
 
  I'm afraid your father was murdered. 
  No. 
  - That's not right. 
  - He had a heart attack. 
  - We were both here. 
  - Someone's got mixed up. 
  I'm afraid not. 
  The day your father died, a beautician was here. 
  That wasn't unusual. 
  She came every week. 
  Usually during board meetings. 
  During? 
  Dad liked to make his disdain for the business side clear. 
  So you saw her? 
  Do either of you remember what she looks like? 
  Um do you recognize this woman? 
  Mm? 
  Stop it, Eve. 
  I can feel your excitement. 
  Don't get all giddy and sing along to the radio in my car. 
  I knew it. 
  I knew it! 
  A new girl. 
  Perhaps, or maybe it's someone so good, she's been operating undetected for a while. 
  Villanelle will be furious. 
  They can't remember a single thing about her? 
  - Nothing. 
  - That's convenient. 
  I know, I know, but . 
  . 
  I do believe them. 
  So what kind of woman does no one ever pay attention to, especially people like the Peels? 
  It has to be someone who can go about their business without anyone noticing because because what they do is seemingly uninteresting. 
  They're, they're not important. 
  They're They're invisible. 
  It's the kind of woman who people look at every day and never see. 
  What are you looking for? 
  A kitchen knife. 
  What for? 
  To stab you with. 
  Nothing sharp in the house, I'm afraid. 
  Mom might cut herself. 
  Are you going to the doctor's? 
  Will you just stop badgering me for five minutes! 
  Erm I'll bring you back some flu tablets. 
  Hello, Dozen Incorporated. 
  It's Cher Horowitz. 
  I've failed my driving test. 
  I'm sorry, Ms. 
  Horowitz, we haven't got anyone here who can help you. 
  Thank you for your call. 
  Operator. 
  - Connect me to M. I. 6, please. 
  - Is this a prank call? 
  No, I need to speak to M. I. 6. 
  I'm sorry, we can't disclose that number. 
  Okay, well Tell them I'm going to blow up the Houses of Parliament. 
  You know, I get calls like this every day. 
  Very distressing. 
  Hello? 
  Please clearly state the name of the person you wish to be connected to after the tone. 
  Eve Polastri. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I didn't catch that. 
  Eve Polastri. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I didn't catch that. 
  Eve Polastri, you piece of sh1t! 
  I forgot my Please hang up and try again. 
  Please hang up and try again. 
  Please hang up The Ghost? 
  She's the opposite of Villanelle. 
  She's, um careful and anonymous. 
  And meticulous and discreet. 
  Right now, we have no idea how long she's been operating or who she works for. 
  We're working on the assumption that this is a woman, late-to-middle age, looks like an immigrant worker so she's not white - What makes you think that? 
  - The fact you interrupted me mid-sentence makes me think that. 
  So this is our new lead. 
  We'll focus on The Ghost from now on. 
  We can rule out Villanelle from this investigation. 
  Wait, wait. 
  Uh, not entirely. 
  Why not? 
  We don't need her anymore. 
  Uh Yeah, but, um Surely she's worth investigating? 
  She might know something about The Ghost. 
  Eve, can you come with me, please? 
  Quickly. 
  Are you sure it was her? 
  Eve Polastri, you piece of sh1t! 
  Who were you calling? 
  - No one. 
  - Don't lie to me. 
  You ungrateful You think anyone else would pick up a girl like you, give her a roof over her head? 
  You thought I'd be an easy target, didn't you? 
  Thought you'd take advantage of the Good Samaritan. 
  I see what you're doing. 
  Don't think I haven't noticed. 
  Playing the innocent, batting your eyelashes, getting me to wait on you hand and foot, feed you, look after you, give you everything you want. 
  And what do I get, hm? 
  What do I get? 
  Nothing! 
  Nothing! 
  Why don't I get anything? 
  It was a surprise! 
  I - I didn't want to tell you. 
  - What are you talking about? 
  I was on the phone to a bakery. 
  I was ordering you a cake. 
  What cake? 
  To thank you . . 
  for being my knight in shining armor. 
  Oh Oh, Elizabeth I'm sorry. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  What an idiot I am. 
  What must you think of me? 
  I think you're going to bleed to death. 
  What? 
  Urgh! 
  This is what you get, Julian. 
  Where is she? 
  Well, she called through the operator. 
  We only have the area code but the police have been informed. 
  She won't get far. 
  Hello, Villanelle. 
  - Who are you? 
  - Raymond, your new handler. 
  I thought I'd been fired. 
  Circumstances have changed. 
  - No, thanks. 
  - You called us. 
  From an unprotected line. 
  That wasn't very clever, was it? 
  You know what? 
  I've had a really shitty couple of days. 
  And I really, really need to go to a doctor. 
  What I don't need is a boring stranger in a Volvo, giving me a lesson on how to use the phone! 
  Alright. 
  - Off you go. 
  - What? 
  If you don't want to work with me, off you go. 
  Fine. 
  Whatever. 
  Only joking. 
  Who do you think you work for, Oksana? 
  Do you think you can just do whatever you want? 
  You're on a very tight leash from now on. 
  Alright? 
  A choke lead. 
  Antibiotics are in the glove compartment. 
  There's some water in there so you can swallow them down. 
  49! 
  Number 49! 
  - Yes, ma'am. 
  - Thank you. 
  - The house is clear. 
  - Thank you. 
  He's still warm. 
  Oh, my God. 
  She's gone. 
  Damn it! 
  We were so close, she was right here. 
  I think we're going to have to get you some protection. 
  Oh, yeah, you think? 
  There's someone we need to speak to. 
  Hey. 
  Everything okay? 
  What's up with him? 
  Promise you won't be cross. 
  Hello, Eve.
