 - You were superb last night. 
- Thank you.    
 What's going on?    
 Oh, did you get me a croissant?    
 No. Do you want the rest of this?    
 Of course I want the rest of that.    
 Mmm! [CRUNCHES]    
 How are you so perky? 
You left after I did.    
 I went for a run this morning, then I ate some coal.    
 Apparently it's a thing. I feel great.    
 Okay, from what I can eavesdrop on,  a Russian sex-trafficking politician's been murdered in Vienna.    
 - Oh, no. 
- I know, bum-out.    
 - Why are they crying about it here? 
- Don't know.    
 - Was it a contract kill? 
- I don't know.    
 You really earn your money, you know?    
 - I have no idea what we do here. 
- Get me a croissant.    
 Right. Everyone's in there with Frank.    
 - God. 
- And [GASPS] oh, Lord.    
 - It's Carolyn Martens. 
- Who?    
 MI . Russia desk.    
 Ugh, I'd nail a cousin to work with that woman.    
 - Stone-cold badass. 
- I'll put in a good word.    
 No, please don't. You're the late one.    
 [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]    
 Professional.    
 Where did you get that?    
 Okay. Well, thank you all for giving us your Saturday.    
 Turns out people are still murderous bastards on the weekend. [CHUCKLES]    
 [CHUCKLES]    
 [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE]    
 This is Carolyn Martens, head of the Russian desk.    
 - You've met Bill Pargrave. 
- Hi.    
 And his late assistant.    
 Eve Polastri. My apologies...    
 They assess and provide diplomatic protection for visitors to the UK and will be your liaison.    
 It was Bill's birthday party last night.    
 They don't normally look this sweaty.    
 It was just a spontaneous thing.    
 Mm-hmm.    
 Good morning.    
 [PAPER RUSTLES]     
 There's been an assassination in Vienna.     
 Victor Kedrin was a Russian politician visiting Austria last week.     
 He was not a popular man.     
 But he had an unfortunately high profile.     
 Yesterday, Kedrin was coming out of an exceptionally good, by the way, sushi restaurant near Stephansplatz with his girlfriend, Kasia Molkovska.     
 Somehow, about    yards from the restaurant, the assassin managed to slice Kedrin's femoral artery with a blade without him or his girlfriend noticing.     
 He was bleeding for about a minute before he collapsed.     
 Cool.     
 His girlfriend is the only witness, but she fled the scene.     
 Interpol traced her here to the UK.     
 She was picked up in Hammersmith this morning and needs protection.     
 -    quid it was a woman. 
- Sorry?     
 Sorry. Nothing.     
 BILL: We'll be sure to sort it.     
 Was there any CCTV of the killer?     
 No. No, as far as we know, it was just a blind spot.     
 Thank you for your... time.     
 I imagine the girl is, erm, quite traumatized.     
 She's the only witness.     
 Surround her with humans, will you?     
 [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]     
 I said it was probably a woman.     
 Victor Kedrin was a misogynist and a s*x trafficker.     
 He may not have considered a passing woman a threat.     
 She must have been able to get close.     
 Thank you. Thank you, Eve.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 Ohh.     
 She said, "Eve."     
 Congratulations.     
 Give me the rest of that, or I'll fire you.     
 [PAPER RUSTLES]     
 I want to meet that witness.     
 - If I'm right, then... 
- No. Not your job.     
 Get her secure and get her some clothes.     
 Please don't make this a thing. I'm feeling very fragile.     
 I'm telling you, it's a woman.     
 Happy birthday, Bill.

 Three days ago, one of Moscow's most controversial politician was found professionally murdered in a pretty street in Vienna.     
 Very good.     
 The murder took place in a CCTV blind spot.     
 Also good.     
 The politician's girlfriend was reportedly with him while he died.     
 Fine.     
 And was not harmed.     
 Not so good.     
 She is currently in London, where she will be interviewed as a principal witness to the murder.     
 Bad.     
 Which will take place tomorrow.     
 Very bad.     
 Have you had a haircut?     
 Yes.     
 Hmm.     
 Your train leaves in an hour.     
 So keep the job tidy, huh?     
 Your fancy hairpin is all over the press.     
 Don't worry. I got another one.     
 - It's not funny. 
- It was a bit.     
 They won't catch me.     
 [SCOFFS]     
 - They might. 
- They won't.     
 - No, listen, they might. 
- [IMITATING KONSTANTIN] They won't.     
 Make it look like suicide.     
 [SIGHS]     
 First class?     
 Of course.     
 - EVE: Lunch swap? 
- BILL: Sure.     
 Oh. Your wife is an artist.     
 She's a control freak.     
 Can I eat this cold?     
 Yeah. Just don't tell Niko.     
 How is he?     
 He's really well.     
 He's really nice.     
 He's really well.     
 Okay. Is that what you've been wanting to talk about?     
 You've been weirdly casual all morning.     
 - I don't want to talk about that. 
- Spit it out.     
 You've got as long as this pie lasts.     
 Okay.     
 The Kedrin assassin was a woman.     
 - Oh, my God! 
- I interviewed the witness, and she confirmed it...     
 I'll give you the    quid to shut up.     
 - There was CCTV. 
- No, no, no, no.     
 See, there wasn't any CCTV until after I suggested it might be a woman.     
 Did you just say you interviewed the witness?     
 - Eve! What's happened to you? 
- Nothing. Nothing happened.     
 - You're going mad. 
- Nothing ever happens.     
 And, see, now this woman is happening, and either someone is stopping it from coming out or someone is too lazy to follow it up.     
 Are you accusing me of something?     
 I don't know. Maybe.     
 Yes! Maybe you're being lazy!     
 And so what if it is a woman, anyway?     
 I don't care if it was an alien.     
 Yeah, but she's... she's new, and she's prolific, Bill.     
 - Look. 
- It's not our job.     
 I've been compiling these cases for months.     
 Tuscany yesterday.     
 Kasia is the only lead we have, and, tomorrow morning, she's someone else's witness.     
 Yes, and they'll interview her and find it all out for themselves.     
 What if they're in on it?     
 In on what?     
 I don't know. 
I just think... it's weird.     
 Our job is weird, but it's also boring.     
 I'm... sorry if your husband is boring you, too, but that doesn't give you an excuse to go rogue at work.     
 You could get in a lot of trouble if I was a serious man.     
 Trouble's not interested in me.     
 Go to the hospital, make sure your witness is cozy and safe, then go home and don't do anything weird.     
 [SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE]     
 It's only two or three questions.     
 Just say you're her cousin.     
 I'm with the security team monitoring Kasia Molkovska.     
 Last on the left.     
 Ask for Nurse Watkins.     
 You can't miss her. 
She's in the "fun" scrubs.     
 Eve Polastri.     
 Hi. Is Kasia awake?     
 Uh, she's not fit for interview, I'm afraid.     
 Oh, no. I know. 
This is a relative of Kasia's.     
 He just wanted to say hi quickly.     
 Oh, lovely. Okay, uh, just take a seat.     
 I'll let you know when she's ready.     
 Great. Thank you.     
 [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER P.A.]     
 - Is this legal? 
- It's fine.     
 Wait here a sec. 
I'm just gonna pop to the loo.     
 We should have brought her some chocolate or something.     
 I'll see what I can find.

 [CELLPHONE RINGING]     
 - Hi. 
- BILL: Where are you?     
 On the loo.     
 There was no CCTV.     
 What?     
 It's annoying me, but you were right.     
 We've been bullshat.     
 Keep that girl safe.

 Oh, my God, Kasia! Oh, God, God, Kasia!     
 Oh, my God! Oh, Kasia. Oh, Kasia.     
 Please. Please, stay with me.     
 Somebody help me! Oh, my God!     
 Somebody help me!     
 - [MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY] 
- Kasia, stay with me.     
 Stay with me. No, no.     
 Bedzie dobrze.     
 [GASPING]     
 Bedzie dobrze.     
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!     
 Oh! Somebody help me!

 [TELEPHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE]     
 If they fire you, you'd better drag me down with you.     
 - No, you're not doing that. 
- I am.     
 I've been looking for an excuse to call Frank a dick-swab for years.     
 I'm the dick-swab.     
 I should have requested more security.     
 You had two armed officers. 
You did the right thing.     
 [BREATHES SHARPLY]     
 You're brilliant.     
 Just don't tell them everything.     
 You'll sound like a nutter.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 FRANK: Right.     
 The boy's parents are here.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 Apparently, they thought he was playing bridge.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 [THUMPS LIGHTLY]     
 Have you made your statement?     
 Mm.     
 [SIGHS] Well... that one could have gone better.     
 I don't want to say you only had one job...     
 Oh, piss off, Frank.     
 [TELEPHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE]     
 I don't think you should speak to me like that right now, Eve.     
 [SNIFFLES] Can you... Can you just tell me what I need to do?     
 From what I've managed to gather, you have conducted an illegal investigation.     
 You've manipulated a witness. 
You've put a minor in danger.     
 - Oh, please. 
- And on top...     
 Don't interrupt me, Bill.     
 On top of that, you failed at your actual job, no doubt because you were so busy executing your pretend job, which I believe was going to earn you    quid.     
 And which you both seem to think is the most important thing about this case.     
 No. The most important thing is that I was right about the fact...     
 No. No, the most important thing, Eve, is that four people are dead, and it's all your fault!     
 [SIGHS]     
 [TELEPHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE]     
 What were you right about?     
 Kasia described the killer as "ale decha," which means flat-chested.     
 - No one would ever... 
- How do you know that?     
 Because I secretly recorded the interview and brought it home and asked Dom and my husband to translate it for me!     
 - You're fired. 
- You're a dick-swab.     
 - Oi! 
- Sorry.     
 Thank you, Bill.     
 No, I was gonna call you a dick-swab.     
 Clearly there's going to be some reshuffling in your department.     
 I suggest you both leave, immediately.     
 Your things will be biked to you.     
 [KEYS JINGLING]     
 [SNIFFLING]     
 - Just to be clear, Frank... 
- You're fired.     
 Excellent. Thank you.

 Eve.     
 H-Hi.     
 Is there... anything you need at the shop?     
 What?     
 Milk or...     
 Uh...     
 [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE]     
 Married?     
 Yes.     
 You?     
 A few times, yes.     
 [DOOR CHIMES]     
 Uh, it's really nice of you to come and... whatever this is.     
 Um, do you... do you want milk?     
 We think she's been operating for   years across    countries.     
 She's highly skilled, as yet untraceable, and, frankly, she's starting to show off.     
 When you're feeling perkier...     
 I'd like to buy you breakfast at the Purple Penguin restaurant by Charing Cross.     
 Thursday.  :   a.m.     
 I'll wait for    minutes.     
 [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY IN DISTANCE]     
 Right. Buy some milk.     
 Oh. Oh.     
 Or he'll think you're having an affair.     
 Oh, no, I don't think he'd ever think that.     
 They all think we're having affairs before they think we're secret agents.     
 Oh, no, I think Niko would assume I was an agent before ever thinking that I was having an affair.     
 You might want to make him think you're having an affair, then.     
 Hope to see you Thursday.
