 What's the deal with you and Villanelle? 
  How much of the day do you spend thinking about her? 
  - Most of it. 
  - Hi, partner! 
  I hate to be strict but she really mustn't kill anyone. 
  I want the recipe to your shepherd's pie. 
  - Niko - Are you gonna leave us alone now? 
  Of course not. 
  Why don't you sit down? 
  I'm going to Rome. 
  Come with me. 
  There's a hotel near to Aaron's palazzo you can stay in. 
  The safe word is "gentleman". 
  Sounds like you've got competition, Eve. 
  They're both cold-blooded psychopaths. 
  The perfect match. 
  There are some people coming for dinner. 
  Business. 
  So that's Peel's weapon. 
  - Did we get all that? 
  - Yeah. 
  You should let yourself go once in a while. 
  I can help you. 
  What are you doing? 
  Okay. 
  Morning. 
  Did you sleep well? 
  Sleep well? 
  Like a baby. 
  I got you a coffee, Mrs. 
  Robinson. 
  Just call Jess and let her know how we're doing. 
  How much detail would you like me to go into? 
  I'll let you get back to your girlfriend. 
  It's cold. 
  Hi, Jess. 
  Are we going out today? 
  Yes. 
  When I've finished this. 
  What are you doing? 
  Some potential buyers are coming by. 
  So I'm just looking through their knicker drawers. 
  Can I see? 
  Mm. 
  There's this chap. 
  Hm. 
  Uh What a weird-looking gentleman. 
  sh1t. 
  Oh Hugo. 
  Hugo Oh Okay. 
  - Eve - Oh, my God, you're alive. 
  I played dead. 
  The hero's technique. 
  Villanelle used the safe word. 
  Well, it's a bit late for that. 
  - Here. 
  Lie down. 
  - Okay. 
  - Press down. 
  - What are you doing? 
  I'll tell them downstairs to call an ambulance. 
  - Don't leave me. 
  - You'll be okay. 
  Please. 
  Please! 
  Please Eve Hello? 
  Okay. 
  Oh Excuse me. 
  Oi, excuse me. 
  Buongiorno. 
  - You speak English? 
  - Mm. 
  I'm looking for a friend of mine. 
  I thought I saw him come in here. 
  - What does he look like? 
  - He's tall, leather jacket. 
  - When was this? 
  - About five minutes ago. 
  I'm really sorry, sir. 
  I haven't seen anyone come in. 
  It's been really quiet today. 
  Maybe try next door. 
  Do you live here, in Rome? 
  Yes. 
  Are you free tonight? 
  - What? 
  - For dinner. 
  Uh Yeah, sure. 
  My My shift finishes at six. 
  Okay. 
  I'll pick you up at six, then. 
  My name's Danny. 
  Do you like sushi? 
  - Sure, I love sushi. 
  - Great. 
  Cool. 
  See you later, then. 
  Cool. 
  Hey. 
  Grazie. 
  Eve Polastri. 
  Yes? 
  Do the secret service really pay that badly? 
  I'd have found you something more exciting than cleaning my house if I'd known. 
  Is that my letter opener? 
  What are you going to do, whittle me to death? 
  Hi, Eve. 
  It's so nice to see you. 
  Russian? 
  Now, that is a surprise. 
  - Good accent. 
  Very precise. 
  - Thank you. 
  And you know each other. 
  I thought I smelled a rat but I wasn't expecting that. 
  I'm flattered. 
  MI6 must be terrified. 
  Eve, can I get you some breakfast? 
  - No. 
  - It's really good. 
  You said you're in trouble. 
  I am. 
  I can't believe this. 
  You know Aaron makes movies, Eve? 
  I mean, they're not great. 
  The murders are okay but I want more story, you know? 
  You saw them? 
  Oh, you didn't want me to see them? 
  Let's go. 
  Now. 
  Come work for me. 
  Come work for you? 
  Like what? 
  Help you make your movies? 
  Yes. 
  You'll get bored with her. 
  You'll never get bored here. 
  I'll make sure of it. 
  Neither of us will ever be bored again. 
  - Villanelle - Ssh. 
  I'm thinking. 
  - What's there to think about? 
  - Don't listen to him. 
  There's nobody else. 
  I'll give you everything. 
  Everything? 
  You can have all of it. 
  Did you hear that, Eve? 
  Everything. 
  Start now. 
  You want me to kill Eve? 
  Yeah. 
  Do you think I would kill you, Eve? 
  Yes. 
  Do you want to watch? 
  Yes. 
  Villanelle! 
  Then watch this. 
  What a dick. 
  You weren't supposed to kill him. 
  You said the safe word. 
  I did? 
  Eve, "gentleman" is a very common word. 
  - I use it all the time. 
  - My God. 
  We'd never get away from someone like that. 
  I did us a favor. 
  It wasn't your decision to make. 
  Do you have any idea how much - trouble we're in? 
  - It's okay. 
  There are armed men outside the hotel. 
  Then I'll take care of it. 
  Eve. 
  Why did I come here? 
  Because you wanted to save me. 
  And you did. 
  These armed men outside, are any of them small, red hair? 
  - I don't think so, no. 
  - Okay, good. 
  - Why? 
  - No reason. 
  Why? 
  There was a guy called Raymond. 
  He's a handler for The Twelve and I'm not his favorite. 
  Is he here? 
  Are The Twelve here? 
  - Uh - Oh, this is a nightmare. 
  Okay, I know this doesn't look great on paper. 
  How are we going to get out of this? 
  - You need to stay calm. 
  - Calm? 
  Are you kidding me? 
  We are never getting out of this. 
  Don't tell me to be calm! 
  We're totally - Are you serious? 
  - You were in shock. 
  You needed a surprise. 
  Like hiccups. 
  Come on. 
  Hurry up. 
  I'm borrowing a maid to help me carry my shopping. 
  Tell Mrs. 
  Leary, Aaron is in a meeting in the dining room and he does not want to be disturbed. 
  - Si, signora. 
  - Come on. 
  You are such an asshole. 
  It's not my fault you're dressed as a maid. 
  You look cute, by the way. 
  - Where are we going? 
  - We? 
  - Yeah. 
  - We are not going anywhere. 
  I'm going back to the hotel. 
  - That's stupid. 
  - I need to get the recordings. 
  Now you've killed Aaron, it's all I have. 
  Eve, it's too late. 
  We need to go. 
  Leave that stuff. 
  - No! 
  - It's not safe to go back. 
  - You know that. 
  - This can't be for nothing. 
  Do you understand? 
  People have died. 
  I left Hugo bleeding to come help you. 
  And you didn't need help. 
  So this cannot be for nothing. 
  None of it means anything. 
  It doesn't matter anymore. 
  It matters to me. 
  You think you'd be fine without me? 
  I think I'd sleep a lot better. 
  You'd be dead in five minutes. 
  Your beautiful hair full of your brains. 
  Fine. 
  You're getting very sassy. 
  If I get shot, I want you to remember that it is your fault. 
  And for my funeral, make sure they choose a flattering photo. 
  Not the mugshot with the bandana. 
  Flattering funeral photo. 
  Got it. 
  Okay. 
  Okay. 
  I will find us a car. 
  I will be parked outside the hotel in five minutes. 
  If you see anything scary, just leave, okay? 
  Don't be brave. 
  See you soon. 
  See you soon. 
  Hugo? 
  Oh, my God. 
  Oh, my God. 
  No, no, no, no, no! 
  - Carolyn? 
  - Hello, Eve. 
  Can I come in? 
  The room's been cleared out. 
  All of the recordings. 
  The Twelve are here. 
  They must have taken it. 
  The Twelve? 
  No. 
  Our team took it. 
  We didn't see much use in hanging around. 
  Best to make a swift exit when things get complicated. 
  Shall we sit down? 
  - Why are you in Rome? 
  - I'm not. 
  I'm at home with a bad cold. 
  Tucked up in bed. 
  - Watching Homes Under the Hammer. 
  - Where's Hugo? 
  Why don't you tell me about Aaron Peel? 
  - He's dead. 
  - How did that happen? 
  Villanelle used the safe word. 
  I thought she was in danger, so I went in - Did you kill him? 
  - Of course not. 
  She did. 
  Alright. 
  That seems clear-cut. 
  Good. 
  Good? 
  Well, it's a bit clumsy, but it's not a terrible result. 
  What about the weapon, the buyers? 
  Unfortunately Aaron Peel isn't the first megalomaniac to think about weaponizing and selling data. 
  But now, thanks to you and Villanelle, he can't. 
  You wanted him dead. 
  - You sent us here to kill him. 
  - On the contrary, I told you both, repeatedly and strenuously, not to kill him. 
  But it's hardly our fault if an assassin for The Twelve murdered Aaron Peel. 
  In fact, I think people will be rather relieved. 
  Villanelle wasn't working for The Twelve. 
  Wasn't she? 
  Who's really to know who she was working for. 
  I do. 
  She was working for us. 
  I understand. 
  This is uncomfortable. 
  This is not uncomfortable. 
  This is a set-up. 
  A set-up? 
  You did exactly what you wanted. 
  This was all your idea. 
  Then why does it suddenly feel like it was yours? 
  It's my job to get the best out of people. 
  Villanelle simply did what she does best. 
  And so did you. 
  You were the person who made this whole operation possible. 
  - You mean I was the pawn. 
  - Don't be twee. 
  This isn't cops and robbers. 
  What Peel was selling would have been catastrophic. 
  Not just for MI6. 
  It was never going to be bloodless. 
  You'll get over it. 
  Come on. 
  No. 
  She wouldn't do the same for you. 
  You don't know that. 
  You can't be on her side and ours. 
  You've got a noose round you're neck. 
  I'm offering to take it off. 
  I'm not going anywhere with you. 
  Well, then, I'm very sorry. 
  Good luck, Eve. 
  When this is over, I'm going to find Kenny and tell him everything you've done. 
  He already knows. 
  He's part of the clean-up operation. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  What are you doing here? 
  Saving your life. 
  Well, you're doing a great job. 
  Thank you. 
  Cash and gun hidden in the dashboard. 
  Great. 
  I'll go get Eve. 
  You have to leave Eve behind. 
  - What? 
  - You can't go back there. 
  - It's not safe. 
  - I'm not leaving her. 
  Listen. 
  It's finished. 
  Get in the car and go. 
  I'm risking a lot to save your ass here. 
  To save me from what? 
  From them. 
  From Raymond. 
  Raymond doesn't know I'm here. 
  He didn't see me. 
  What? 
  He knows you're here. 
  Believe me. 
  If he knows I'm here, then why didn't he kill me already? 
  Because someone asked him not to. 
  Someone asked him not to until after you killed Peel. 
  What do you mean? 
  They told me not to kill him. 
  You told me not to kill him. 
  It was not my idea. 
  Wow. 
  It never is. 
  I warned you. 
  You should have listened. 
  I thought we were friends. 
  We are. 
  But we are not family. 
  Is that what Carolyn is giving you? 
  Your family? 
  Yeah. 
  You choose your family over me? 
  That's what families are. 
  It's what they do. 
  I wouldn't know. 
  Mine are all dead. 
  Most of them, sure. 
  What do you mean, most of them? 
  - Are you leaving? 
  - No. 
 
 
 
  Not without Eve. 
  What if she went with Carolyn already? 
  Hmm. 
  She wouldn't. 
  What is it about her? 
  We are the same. 
  Are you sure? 
  Yeah. 
  I will find you and your family. 
  I don't think so. 
  You are the worst. 
  How long have you been standing there? 
  God, you're such a drama queen. 
  I've been thinking about doing this for a long time. 
  On the train. 
  At night with my wife. 
  Taking my kids to school in the morning. 
  I bet your kids are ugly. 
  They are. 
  They are. 
  You're not scared, are you? 
  Well, not yet, anyway. 
  I don't get scared. 
  We'll see. 
  Why did they send you? 
  The Twelve. 
  What do you mean? 
  Well, why would they send a nobody like you to speak to Aaron Peel? 
  Just because I like to slum it every once in a while doesn't mean that I'm a nobody. 
  In fact, some might say, I'm a real somebody. 
  Wait. 
  Where's Eve? 
  She's probably in one of these rooms, isn't she? 
  Let's play a game. 
  If you can guess which room she's in, you can keep her. 
  But if you get it wrong Yes. 
  - Do it. 
  - What? 
  - Do it! 
  - Shut up. 
  Stop it. 
  She's not going to do it, is she? 
  - Doesn't have it in her. 
  - Let go of her. 
  You know how long it would take to kill me with an Axe? 
  You'd have to chip away at me. 
  - Please stop. 
  - Chunks flying off everywhere. 
  Eve The shoulder? 
  The shoulder? 
  Eve. 
  - The shoulder! 
  - Well, I don't know, do I! 
  Pull it out. 
  - Hit him in the head. 
  - My God - Oh, God, it's stuck. 
  - Pull harder. 
  Oh, God. 
  I'm sorry. 
  - Do it. 
  - They will take you apart for this. 
  Both of you. 
  And everyone you know. 
  Inch by inch. 
  - Do it! 
  - Let me think. 
  Don't think, Eve. 
  He will come after us. 
  Right? 
  He will kill us. 
  - Hit him. 
  - Please. 
  - Hit him. 
  - I have children. 
  Imagine he's a log! 
  Quick, do it! 
  - Again. 
  - Oh, God. 
  Oh, God. 
  Oh Oh He was right. 
  You really did take chunks out of him. 
  Oh - I think I'm going to be sick. 
  - Swallow it. 
  Alright? 
  It's not safe. 
  Someone will come after him. 
  Okay? 
  Ohh, we have to go. 
  Take this off. 
  Take this off. 
  It's okay. 
  We need to go out the back. 
  Eve. 
  Come on. 
  They're coming. 
  We need to hurry. 
  Can you see him? 
  Come on. 
  Down here. 
  - Where are we? 
  - It's a short cut. 
  Where are we going? 
  You'll see. 
  Do you know the way out of here? 
  Relax. 
  Everything is going to be perfect. 
  Trust me. 
  Do you think if we died down here anybody would notice? 
  Slow down. 
  It's so hot. 
  It's okay if you feel weird. 
  You just killed someone for the first time. 
  With an Axe. 
  There is an exit somewhere here, I think. 
  Here. 
  - I can see light. 
  - Oh. 
  Oh. 
  Yes. 
  Come on! 
  He's so sick! 
  Are you sure you're okay? 
  Yeah. 
  Nice job! 
  You need a hand? 
  It's beautiful. 
  What do you want for dinner? 
  - Dinner? 
  - Mm. 
  Tonight I could make dinner. 
  Oh. 
  - Spaghetti? 
  - Good idea. 
  I was thinking, we should go to Alaska. 
  Have you seen pictures? 
  It's so amazing. 
  We could, uh, get a cabin. 
  Nobody would bother us there. 
  We'd be normal. 
  And I have money. 
  So you don't need to worry about that. 
  Okay. 
  You'll feel better soon. 
  I'll look after you. 
  It's going to be amazing. 
  Come on. 
  Through here. 
  Oh. 
  Oh. 
  It's just the birds. 
  We're fine. 
  You have a gun? 
  Yeah. 
  - Since when? 
  - It doesn't matter. 
  - Why didn't you - Hm? 
  Why didn't you shoot Raymond? 
  You had it under control. 
  No, I You wanted me to do it. 
  I wanted you to know how it feels. 
  How did it feel? 
  Wet. 
  I'm proud of you. 
  - Proud? 
  - Yes! 
  We're safe now. 
  You made us safe. 
  - What do you mean? 
  - Well After today, people will be angry. 
  But we can look after ourselves now, can't we? 
  I'm going home. 
  - What? 
  - I've got to go home. 
  - Eve, you can't go home. 
  - Yes, I can. 
  - We need to talk. 
  - No. 
  You're ruining the moment. 
  What do you think is happening here? 
  What? 
  I think we'd You think we'd be, what . . 
  Bonnie and Clyde? 
  Just go on a killing spree? 
  - Cut a few throats? 
  - Stop it. 
  You want me to be a mess. 
  You want me to be scared. 
  But I'm like you now. 
  I'm not afraid of anything. 
  - This is what you wanted. 
  - This is what you wanted! 
  This is what you wanted. 
  No, Eve. 
  Eve, wait. 
  Why are you being like this? 
  You love me. 
  No. 
  - I love you. 
  - No. 
  I do. 
  - You don't understand what that is. 
  - I do. 
  You're mine. 
  - No. 
  - You are! 
  You're mine! 
  Eve! 
  I thought you were special. 
  I'm sorry to disappoint.
