 I've worked with Bill for over    years.    
 I am honored to be speaking here today    
 on behalf of his colleagues, who I can say...    
 really, really liked him.    
 I think we can all agree that Bill was a very loud man.

- [MOURNERS CHUCKLING]    
 He was a good man...    
 patient...    
 hard-working.    
 [CLEARS THROAT] A man who had time for everybody.    
 [SCOFFS] No, he didn't.    
 I think most of that was really reserved for his family.    
 In that sense, I-I would say Bill was...    
 truly a traditional man.    
 [BABY CRYING]    
 Apart from perhaps his, uh, methods of...    
 ... of, uh, team leadership,    
 which could really be only described as...    
 individual, to say the least.    
 For example, we know how much Bill liked    
 - his biscuit Wednesdays. 
- Shh.    
 I'd be lucky if I got a chocolate finger    
 by lunch, but...    
 - uh... 
- [CRYING CONTINUES]    
 But in his heart, see, he was a generous man.    
 And, uh, he was deeply loved and admired...    
 ...so let's not forget that.
