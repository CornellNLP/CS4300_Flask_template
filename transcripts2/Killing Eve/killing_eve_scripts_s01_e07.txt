 You go in, find the doctor, kill Nadia and come out.   
 - We need to find who? 
- Anna.   
 She is the wife of the man Oksana murdered.   
 The British. They're helping me.   
 Konstantin?   
 He's working with them.   
 [EVE]  I need you to look into any private correspondence   
 - between Konstantin... 
- And?   
 Your mother.    
 - Are you going to kill me? 
- Mm-hm.    
 Hello! Let me out. I did it.    
 Hey!    
 Let me out!    
 [SHE SIGHS]    
 - Oh. 
- Oh. Good morning.    
 Have you just... been to breakfast?    
 Uh, no, but... um, I'm hungry.    
 - You? 
- I'm heading there now.    
 Did you wear those clothes yesterday?    
 Listen, Vlad's had a change of heart.    
 They're giving us Nadia.    
 Oh, really? That's... great.    
 He's arranged for us to take her out today.    
 Fantastic. And, you know, I'm so sorry...    
 - Um, have you not... 
- [PHONE BUZZES]    
 Sorry.    
 Oh, good.    
 Hi. Yeah, I'm just with some...    
 Oh? How bad?    
 Oh, Christ.    
 Of course.    
 Where are you?    
 Alright, I'll, um, be right down.    
 Mm. Mm, well...    
 That's, at least, some good news.    
 Who was that?    
 Nadia has been murdered in prison.    
 The good news is the buffet's open.    
 Come on.    
 Did you have a late night, too?    
 Sorry?    
 What happened?    
 Nadia was attacked by another inmate.    
 - How? 
- Just a fight.    
 Happens all the time in those places.    
 - Really? 
- Mm.    
 Does it happen to valuable government sources    
 who are about to be removed from the prison?    
 Sometimes.    
 We were supposed to take Nadia out today.    
 - This isn't a coincidence. 
- You can see it is a blow.    
 For all of us. 
But these sausages are so good.    
 But she was our only lead to the Twelve.    
 - Who did it? 
- A little angry girl    
 called Natalie, I think.    
 Well, I want to meet her. Today.    
 - Now. 
- Eve...    
 [LAUGHS] It's not possible.    
 If Nadia's death was linked to your interest in her,    
 I can't risk that happening again.    
 - So you think there's a link? 
- No. But I have to...    
 - Please don't bullshit me. 
- Eve!    
 We would appreciate any information    
 you feel you can pass on to us.    
 We will wait and hear from you about developments.    
 [KNIFE CLATTERS ONTO PLATE]

 Just give it a second.    
 I can do it. Ooh, my tits are about to drop off.     
 Listen, it sounds mad, but what if the Twelve     
 put Villanelle back in the prison to kill Nadia?     
 - Alright, listen... 
- Or she broke in there.     
 She can get in and out of anywhere.     
 It must have been easy for them to pay a random inmate     
 - to confess to the attack. 
- Eve, there is a limit to...     
 Nadia must have had something decent on the Twelve.     
 We can at least ask if she contacted anyone     
 - while she was there. 
- I'll check CCTV for visitors.     
 No. If we're found probing, it will make things worse.     
 We have to be above board now.     
 - We need to find Anna. 
- Anna isn't relevant now.     
 Yes, she is.     
 Nadia said Anna was the reason Villanelle went to prison     
 - in the first place. 
- She killed her husband.     
 - Yes, but why? 
- Oh, Eve, please!     
 There's no record of Villanelle's family on file.     
 Anna is our only lead to how she ended up where she is.     
 If she is back in Russia, she might go to Anna's.     
 Big "if". And I'm not interested in how     
 Villanelle came to be a killer.

- Why? It doesn't help us.     
 You told me to find her.

 She was good at making you feel bad,     
 so she was here a lot.
