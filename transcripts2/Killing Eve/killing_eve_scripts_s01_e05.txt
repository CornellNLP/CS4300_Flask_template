 Kenny traced the lead. 
Payments made to a school.    
 Both of Frank's kids go there.

 Aah!

She's an actual assassin.    
 She's here to kill him.

 Hello, Frank.     
 Look... what I've done is nowhere near as bad as what a lot of people have done to save their families, okay?     
 We chased the money, we know you're on the payroll.     
 So you might as well start talking.     
 What do they want?     
 [STUTTERING] I think I'm... I think I'm... having a anxiety attack.     
 My arms are... They feel, they're numb.

 Okay, looks like you guys have got this.     
 So, with all due respect, I'm gonna head back to East London grab three bottles of wine, and cry-hump my ex until the memory of this traumatic day evaporates.     
 I understand.     
 Other than that, Carolyn, I had an amazing day.     
 He says he's feeling too weak to talk.     
 Do you want to drag him in here by his armpits?     
 No.     
 I know exactly what he needs.     
 I'm so sorry you have to see this.     
 It's okay, Frank.     
 It's all gonna be okay.     
 Just tell me who these people are.     
 [SIGHS]     
 They call themselves...     
 The Twelve.     
 And they knew everything about me.     
 - They blackmail you? 
- No.     
 No, worse.     
 They offered to pay for my wife's medical treatment.     
 They knew everything about her condition.     
 They knew the NHS wouldn't offer certain treatments for cancer without private patient funding these days.     
 I had no other option.     
 You can't blame the NHS for this.     
 No, of course not.     
 - I blame the government. 
- And the school fees?     
 I just wanted my family to be happy.     
 What information did they want from you?     
 [BREATHES DEEPLY]     
 They just want to know what conversations are being had.     
 They're interested in the big picture.     
 Specifically, information about Russia?     
 No.     
 Although the agent was Russian and we drank a lot, so I just assumed...     
 I thought they were SVR.     
 Standard Russian government agents who wanted a little inside gossip, people's whereabouts...     
 I don't know. They just wanted to know anything and everything.     
 I just wanted my wife to be okay.     
 I think Bill's wife wanted the same for him.     
 I didn't know they were going to go after Bill.     
 I think she took your department rather personally.     
 And how do they know about the department?     
 I told them. I thought you were still investigating after you interrogated me...     
 I did not interrogate you. No, I did not...     
 CAROLYN: For someone who says they know hardly anything, you seem to know rather a lot.     
 Why didn't you come to us?     
 Because I didn't want to get caught here.     
 I thought the Russians... would help.     
 - And the girl. 
- Yes, well, they're very proud of her. They're using her to...     
 What? What are they using her for?     
 There is a sequence.     
 A pattern to these kills.     
 They're destabilizing from the ground up.     
 To what end?     
 Chaos.     
 Any matches for Oksana yet?     
 KENNY:  I'm still working on that. Nothing yet.   
 [SIGHS] Okay.     
 Frank said the organization  calls themselves "The Twelve".   
 Powerful number.     
 - Is it? 
 -    disciples,   
    months of the year,   days of Christmas.     
 Is Elena okay?   
 Oh, yeah, she's taking the afternoon off.     
 Okay.   
 I might call her.   
 Do you think that would be weird?     
 Well, now you have the disciple thing if you need an excuse.     
 I think it would be very thoughtful.     
 Okay.   
 Bye.     
 Police have confirmed that they've found a male body in the site near where you picked up Frank.     
 They're gonna keep us informed.     
 There are three of them.     
 - Someone is unaccounted for. 
- Apparently so.     
 Was that, uh, Kenny on the phone?     
 Yes.     
 Is he, uh...     
 His father died a few years ago, right?     
 Mm-hmm.     
 Very sudden. I just thought...     
 With Bill suddenly...     
 Is he okay?     
 Well, he sounds okay. I... [SIGHS]     
 We're all in shock. I'll keep an eye on him.     
 Good.     
 Uh, do you need an escort home?

 Your eyes will just... empty.     
 Then your soul goes in.     
 People think that your soul or personality, whatever, leaves the body when you die.     
 I swear, it just goes further in.     
 It falls so far in and just...     
 Just becomes so small that it can't control your body anymore.     
 It's just in there, dying forever.

 Hmm? First.     
 But then I'm going to make a mess of your body afterwards so it looks worse than it is.     
 Just so you know, okay?     
 [STAMMERS] No, wait, please, can we... do it in the bedroom?     
 I have a thing for bathrooms, actually.     
 Please?

 VILLANELLE: Diego and Nadia were fighting.     
 - Ugh. 
- And then?     
 And then he just went backwards!     
 I was screaming.     
 Nadia put something in the back of the car and bang, he hit her.     
 Told me to get out of the car and we just walked away.     
 I had no weapon.     
 He said he was going to kill me, I said, "Why?     
 "Why? We're meant to be a team, we have to get the target."     
 Said we were, uh...     
 Oh, God, what's the word he used?     
 "Pumpkins."     
 - So?

 Oh. I thought you had no weapon.

- Oh.     
 While he was pointing it at you?     
 I didn't want to tell you this part of the story because I knew you would be jealous.     
 Hmm?     
 I had to use my tits.     
 [LAUGHS] To kill him?     
 You killed him with your tits?     
 No!     
 When he was looking at them, I took his gun.     
 Ah, okay.     
 - It was so sad, you know? 
- Mmm-hmm.     
 I liked having a team, but you can't trust anyone, huh?     
 You told me that.     
 Nadia is still alive.
