 - Go back to London. 
- Are we leaving?   
 Of course we're not leaving.   
 [EVE]  We need to find Anna.   
 I'm investigating Oksana Ostankova.   
 [ANNA]  I have a few letters from her at home.   
 [EVE] She wrote to you in French?   
 She loved the French lessons the most. She had a fixation.   
 [EVE]  Oksana is not dead. 
She escaped prison.   
 Your wife is big and your daughter is so loud.    
 - Where are they? 
- Screaming in a cupboard somewhere.    
 Urgh!    
 [GUNSHOTS]    
 [NADIA]  The British, they are helping me.   
 I'm going to give them everything.   
 This arrived about a month after he told me she'd died.    
 I'm going to get into the prison security cameras.    
 [EVE] Where are they taking her?    
 Oh, my God!    
 [SPEAKS RUSSIAN]    
 Shut up!    
 Or I'll blow your tiny head to pieces!    
 My dad is going to kill you in the face!    
 No, I'm going to kill your dad in the face.    
 - No! Why? 
- Because he is an arsehole.    
 - You can't say sh1t about Dad! 
- I can!    
 - You can't! 
- Why are you shouting?    
 - I will kill you! 
- I will kill you!    
 [GRUNTS] You are going to die!    
 Ohh! What will make you stop shouting?    
 Food.    
 What?    
 I'm hungry.    
 Oh.    
 Okay.

 Oh, okay.    
 Stick out your thumb. Look vulnerable.    
 I am vulnerable.

 - We can't just confront her. 
- Oh, we can.    
 She had no right to visit Villanelle without asking.    
 Why? She's not your girlfriend. It could be totally innocent.    
 I'm sorry if this is difficult for you.    
 - It's not. I just... 
- Are you frightened of your mother?    
 Of course! Isn't everyone?    
 If she's involved, she's dangerous.    
 There's a reason she went alone and there'll    
 be a reason she wanted us back in London.    
 - We need to respect... 
- No, we need to ask her    
 what the hell she was getting out of my girlfriend.    
 [VOICES TALKING]    
 We don't even know if she's here.    
 - You can open her hotel door? 
- What?    
 You must have some gadgety thing or something?    
 Um... what? No.    
 You. I left my key in my room, number    . Now.    
 Of course, madam.    
 God, it makes me rage how efficient things are    
 when you're a dick to people.    
 Can we at least knock once in case she's naked or something?    
 - Oh, my God. 
- Oh, God, it's been... Jesus!    
 - What the hell?

 Where is she?    
 I didn't er...    
 Right, I'm ready to...

- Why did you...    
 - Why is he in here? 
- Business.    
 So he sells hairdryers now, does he?    
 - I was tidying. 
- Are you two...    
 Who is he?    
 Why aren't you in London? I specifically told you to return to London.    
 So?    
 Villanelle is in the prison.    
 - She's not. 
- [SCOFFS] Really?    
 Somebody broke her out.    
 - What? 
- She attacked Konstantin.    
 Trapped his wife in a cupboard.    
 She's been released and now she's kidnapped his daughter.    
 He's come here to ask me for help.    
 We're... having a little drink.    
 - Breakfast? 
- Yes.    
 What happened to your room?    
 What do you mean?    
 What?    
 Are you a bad person?    
 Yup.    
 - Have you kidnapped me? 
- Yup.    
 Are you a pedophile?    
 No.    
 Okay, good.    
 Why don't you speak Russian?    
 I don't like it.    
 Where are we going next?    
 To get some money 
and then to see your dad.    
 Why didn't you take my mum?    
 [SCOFFS] She's too big.     
 Why is your English so good?     
 Language is information.     
 And information...     
 [BOTH] Is everything.     
 Yeah, I know.     
 [LAUGHS]     
 You don't know that one, do you?     
 Is my dad bad?     
 Yes, he is the worst.     
 [CRUNCHES]     
 Are you?     
 I don't know yet.     
 Is it hard to be bad?     
 Not if you practice.     
 Finish that. We're going.     
 - Where? 
- To see an old friend.     
 What?     
 You can't speak Mandarin, can you?     
 Shut up.     
 I'm still learning.     
 Kenny, will you book flights for you and Eve?     
 I'll save you some cereal.     
 What are you...     
 Why aren't your security services on it?     
 I thought she might make contact with you.     
 - Why? 
- You said you'd a connection.     
 Oh, no, I haven't had any contact with her since we came.     
 [KENNY] Why has she taken your daughter?     
 - So I follow her. 
- Why would she want that?     
 She's been told to kill me.     
 I'm her next target. And I don't know where she is.     
 Why would The Twelve want you dead?     
 I don't know. I work for Russian Intelligence.     
 Someone always wants me dead.     
 I need to find my daughter.     
 She's going to drive that woman crazy.     
 - Is she really annoying? 
- She's so annoying.     
 [KONSTANTIN SIGHS]     
 She's amazing but so annoying.     
 We should go back to Anna's.     
 Villanelle's gonna go there.     
 You've met Anna?     
 [RINGING TONE]     
 Yes.     
 [PHONE RINGING]     
 [DOOR BUZZER]     
 [EVE] Hopefully I'll get to her before Villanelle does.     
 I'll bring Anna back here.     
 Good, then I'll ask Vlad     
 to organize somewhere for her to stay.     
 You pack up the base, get home and we will talk later.     
 I want to...     
 You either want a job, in which case do what I say.

 Alright, I'm going to Vlad. Eve, do you need a car?
