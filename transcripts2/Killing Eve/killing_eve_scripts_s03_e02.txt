 You need to go electric.    
 Great advice. Thanks.    
 I saw you talking to yourself earlier.    
 Excuse me?    
 And you drink a lot.    
 Okay, this might have worked for you before, but just so you know, it's failing.    
 And for your information, I'm not drunk.    
 You will be by the end of the night.    
 It's pull, by the way.    
 No judgement on my part.    
 I'm just making an observation.    
 Well, go observe somewhere else.    
 Oh-ho-ho.    
 Wow! Are you always this defensive?    
 Are you always this much of a dick?    
 I... I'm not... I'm not drunk.    
 He's just very...    
 ... very annoying.

 Vodka. Straight.    
 And make it double.    
 Not because I'm Russian.    
 Because it works.    
 Kenny would be so touched.    
 What do you want?    
 Gin.    
 Gin, please.    
 I hear you are a walking miracle.    
 - Oh, hallelujah! 
- Ha!    
 You know, when a bullet has been through you, it leaves something behind.    
 Poor Kenny.    
 Oh, he'd hate this.    
 He chose it.    
 How do you know what he chose?    
 Jumping off a building    
 - is a very clear choice. 
- Oh, bullshit. Don't say...    
 Why is everyone saying he jumped?!    
 [WHISPERS] Just be quiet.    
 You must think of the family.    
 Please, don't pretend... for one second, that you ever think of anyone but yourself.    
 - Oh... 
- I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.    
 Oh, you...    
 - Having a good night? 
- Yeah, well, you know what?    
 You've really got this whole, um, smug face thing down, don't you?    
 It's just my face.    
 BEAR: Tune!    
 Yeah, he'd... he'd always play this when he won the office table tennis.    
 Which wasn't very often, was it?    
 Excuse me? I'm sorry.    
 Um... did you... did you work with Kenny at Bitter Pill?    
 Uh, yeah... yeah, that's right.    
 - How was he? I was... 
- Jamie Hayward, founder, editor of Bitter Pill.    
 Now, if you have any queries about Kenny's work...    
 - No, I... 
- ... you can come to me.    
 I have no queries.    
 Excuse me.

 It was one of Mum's dinners.     
 I was about eight, nine, and I'd had a nightmare and you found me crying on the stairs.     
 Hmm!     
 You told me you were there as monster watch, to make sure that nothing scary would come into the house.     
 And... then you taught me how to swear in Russian.     
 - I did?

- Yeah.     
 You haven't changed a bit.     
 You have!     
 Geraldine, can you ask them to change that music?     
 It's terribly dreary.     
 Today isn't about pretending we're not sad, Mum.     
 It's about acknowledging the sadness together.     
 Couldn't we be sad and listen to good music?     
 - She staying long with you?

- You're welcome.     
 Everything you asked for.     
 Good light, high ceilings.     
 Chan, did you check the water pressure?     
 - Excellent. 
- That was hard to get.     
 You know if you quit smoking, you'd look, like,    years younger.     
 Why would I want to look    years younger?     
 This neighbourhood is nice.     
 You like what you see?     
 It's good to have many lovers.     
 It keeps you limber.     
 But you have to know, we are different from these people.     
 Things they take for granted: package holidays, car in drive, date nights on sofa.     
 We can't have these things.     
 Winners win alone.     
 You can't go down that path anymore.     
 I dealt with it.

 So, you don't think about her anymore?

 Okay.     
 So, the job went well, they're happy, they're very happy with you.

 The paprika was kind of fun.     
 - I'd have gone turmeric, but... 
- So, what do they do now?     
 Do they send me a letter of promotion or something?     
 They want you to work with somebody first.     
 What are you talking about?     
 You have to show them that you're up to the job.     
 He's a new recruit.     
 You will be overseeing him. 
You will be giving him orders.     
 If you want more control, you have to show them you have some judgement.

 Morning!

 Maybe we should start with the report on Agent...

We weren't... expecting...

 You're... on leave.     
 Surely, that's my decision.     
 I know returning to work is a welcome distraction.     
 I don't believe in distractions.     
 I'm fully capable of doing my job, without any approval from you.     
 I know you think I'm a self-serving prick.     
 And... well, maybe I am.     
 But, Carolyn, your son has just died.     
 Some things are bigger than the job, and this is one of them.     
 You have to start taking care of yourself right now.

 Do you have my airline tickets?     
 They want you to stay in London a bit longer.

 ... didn't take his own life.     
 Yes.     
 But I have to be...     
 ... discreet.     
 I can't... let people know I'm looking into things.     
 You were potentially the last person to speak to him properly and it's imperative we talk.     
 Carolyn, I would do anything for Kenny to be alive and I am sorry you are going through this, I am.     
 But I don't work for you anymore.     
 Not after what you did in Rome.     
 I have something that I think may interest you.     
 An agitator in Catalonia, killed in her own shop.     
 No-one's claimed it.     
 She hasn't been active for months.     
 Not since Rome.     
 We actually thought she was dead.     
 She's back, Eve.     
 And she's working.

 A: for excellent killing. 
B: could do better.     
 - That kind of thing? 
- You don't grade him.     
 You guide him.     
 Make sure his plan is clean, his character work is strong.     
 You know, just like I used to do with you.     
 - What if he's totally useless? 
- Then encourage him.     
 You tell him he's great.     
 You tell him you know he can do it.     
 You make him believe he can be good.     
 Why can't I just do the work and he watch?     
 - So much easier. 
- Management is not easy.     
 It's watching someone do job worse than you.     
 That's why it sucks.

 - I asked you. 
- Why did you hire him?     
 MI . Whiz online.     
 Integrity.     
 He was a triple threat.     
 You didn't want him to look into anything specific?     
 I don't tell people what to investigate.     
 They work on what's important to them.     
 And Kenny didn't say what is important to him?     
 What's important to you?     
 See, this isn't about me.     
 See, that's where I think you're wrong.     
 If it wasn't about you, you wouldn't have the phone.

 Either you keep it, with no way of cracking into it, and Kenny's death grows colder by the hour, or you hand it over and we get going.     
 I want the files he was working on.     
 There's no way I'm handing over classified information without seeing that phone.

 S Club  , mostly.     
 - And he liked the job? 
- Loved it.     
 He missed you, though.     
 He said nobody kicked his arse like you did.     
 I could be hard on him.     
 My mum told me I was brilliant at everything, even when I wasn't.     
 I spent four years trying to be an artist without any actual talent.     
 Being hard on someone is sometimes what they need.     
 The ancient Celts used to mourn their loved ones with wailing and shrieking.     
 It was just a public ritual for them.     
 They weren't embarrassed about it in the least.     
 Don't be embarrassed, will you?     
 ['DIDO AND AENEAS' BY HENRY PURCELL PLAYS]     
 ['DIDO AND AENEAS' PLAYS IN CAR]     
 [KNOCKS]     
 There you are!     
 I said...     
 Can I get in?     
 ['DIDO AND AENEAS' CONTINUES]     
 Can I turn this... ?     
 - [TURNS MUSIC VOLUME DOWN] 
- Okay.     
 Are you coming in to work?     
 There's no point.     
 Why?     
 There's no point coming in because I'm not allowed to do my work.     
 And there's no point in going home because my daughter...     
 ... is taking over the house, wanting...     
 ... to talk.     
 Well, you can't just sit here.     
 I can.     
 I've got my sandwiches. I'm fine.     
 [TURNS MUSIC VOLUME UP]     
 What a way to go.     
 Sorry?     
 What a terrible death.     
 Dido...     
 ... abandoned by Aeneas...     
 ... dies of grief.     
 Oh, right.     
 [TURNS MUSIC OFF]     
 I can't...     
 ... solve it, Mo.     
 I can't investigate it.     
 My hands are tied.     
 It's my son...     
 [INHALES] ... and I can't... solve it.     
 [DOORBELL RINGS]     
 I need to speak with Carolyn.     
 GERALDINE: I'm not sure she's really up for...     
 Mum?     
 It's all right.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 Geraldine, why don't you go and do your thing, where you...     
 ... close your eyes and breathe?     
 Do you mean sleep?     
 Go ahead.     
 Eve, if you have come here to berate me about the other day, do you mind if we do it in the morning?     
 - I'm a little tired. 
- I have Kenny's phone.     
 I see.     
 I need to know what happened, who killed him.     
 Well...     
 ... as you know...     
 ... in the field, when someone dies, they can... fuel you, in a good way.     
 But this is different.     
 Do you understand?     
 I understand.     
 All right.     
 I miss his smell.     
 Carolyn...     
 What do you want from me?     
 EVE: There's a thumb drive he was working on.     
 [THROUGH MICROPHONE] The police have it.     
 We need to get a hold of it.     
 We need to crack into it.     
 We'll keep it confidential.     
 KONSTANTIN: Nice place.     
 No...     
 - Oh, yes. 
- No.     
 - No. 
- No?!     
 - Really?! 
- Aah!     
 Oh! Oh! No! Stop!     
 You do not get to come here without an invitation anymore!     
 Fine!     
 - Fine. 
- [DOG BARKS OUTSIDE]     
 Can I please come to see you?     
 - [KICK THUDS] 
- Aagh!     
 [SIGHS]     
 I'll think about it.     
 Ohh...     
 Oh!     
 Oh, God...     
 [GROANS] Oh, I missed you.     
 - Hmm. 
- You look good.     
 Haven't you heard?     
 I'm moving up in the world.     
 [SCOFFS] Really?     
 They're making me a Keeper.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 - Who told you that? 
- Dasha.     
 - Dasha? 
- Mm.     
 You trust Dasha after what she did to you?     
 I trust her more than I trust you.     
 You always said you were going to kill her.     
 If I killed everybody who betrayed me, there would be nobody left.     
 You know I had no choice in Rome.     
 Ah, I hope your family was worth it.     
 [EXHALES] That's up for debate.     
 Look...     
 ... now you're back with The Twelve, especially now, you have to know,     
 - you're not safe. 
- I'm fine.     
 You think you're in control, but you are not.     
 And you think I'm going to listen to you     
 - after everything that you did? 
- Okay, fine.     
 There's something else.     
 Eve...     
 ... she is alive.     
 It's not possible.     
 I saw her with my own eyes.     
 [UNSETTLING MUSIC SWELLS]     
 I shot her.     
 When you get angry and run away without checking if the person is actually dead...     
 [VOICE FADES] ... miracles happen.     
 But don't go to London.     
 I don't want anything to happen to you.     
 [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]     
 [GASPS]     
 Villanelle?     
 Villanelle?     
 Villanelle...     
 I'm fine.     
 Really, I'm fine. You should go.     
 How do you know I'm back with The Twelve?     
 'Cause I never stopped working for them.     
 You know I care about you.     
 I know you're full of sh1t.     
 Can't it be both?     
 Oh...
