 [KATY] 
  After years of dreaming, I had finally  finished my Parsons application. 
   I could have dropped it off at any mailbox  in Washington Heights, but instead,  I went all the way downtown,  on the same block as my childhood apartment. 
   I guess you could say I was clutching to the past,  but the thing is, Parsons wasn't just my dream... 
   it was my mom's, too. 
   She may have had secrets,  but all I wanted was to share this moment with her... 
   and K.O.... 
  but I couldn't. 
   As hard as it was going to be,  it was time for me to move on, to move forward. 
   [PEPPER] 
  To Katy Keene, soon to join the ranks  of Parsons' fashion elite. 
   - Yeah! 
  - Aw, thank you, guys. 
   Now I just have to get in. 
   Yes, but in the meantime you need to celebrate. 
   I know. 
  And I know this might sound stupid,  but I always pictured  sharing this milestone with my mom. 
   When I mailed that application,  I imagined her there with me. 
   That doesn't sound stupid, love. 
   She would be proud of you. 
   [KATY] 
  And this is also the kind of thing  I'd want to share with K.O.,  but, obviously, I can't. 
   Look, I'm sorry you miss him, my love, I am. 
   But you are young, you are single,  in New York City. 
   It's time to have a little fun. 
   Starting with that stud down the bar  who has not stopped checking you out. 
   Timothée Chala-may-I-please. 
   Well, that guy is hot. 
   Guys, no. 
   I'm not ready to date someone new. 
   You don't need a date. 
   What you need is a rebound... 
   with a capital D. 
   [PEPPER] 
  Yes. 
  Casual is key. 
   I don't even remove a sock  unless there's no chance of emotional attachment. 
   - [PHONE BUZZES] 
  - Ooh! 
  Speaking of meaningless s*x,  if you'll excuse me. 
  I have a date. 
   - Bye. 
  - Bye. 
   - Go on. 
  - [KATY HUFFS] 
   Guys, I wish I could be like Pepper,  but K.O. 
  was my first kiss, my first boyfriend. 
   I mean, he's the only guy that I've ever, you know, been with. 
   I'm sorry, you've only been with one guy? 
   Josie, how are you feeling about the EP? 
   I will feel better once I make it through this week. 
   There's the listening party that Alex planned,  and I still haven't told him that my contract stipulates  that I baby-sit him. 
  So, yeah. 
   - [PATRONS EXCLAIM] 
  - Ugh! 
   Can you believe it? 
  Every day  some new hobbyist queen who's Insta-famous  just strolls in here like she owns the place. 
   Well, if it isn't Miss Busted Broadway. 
   Deveraux, what you doin' here, girl? 
   I thought you was too good for Molly's. 
   Just giving back to the less fortunate. 
   And scoping out my future Thursday night gig. 
   Sis, no, no. 
   Thursday's Ginger's night. 
   Oh, you haven't heard. 
   The Miss Washington Heights pageant  just moved to Molly's. 
   Winner gets prime time,  the most lucrative night at the bar. 
   And the winner will be me... 
   Deveraux. 
  [SNAPS FINGERS] 
   [DISHES CLINKING] 
   Mmm! 
   What's all this, then? 
   Eggs à la francaise. 
   - Mmm. 
  - My Nanima's secret recipe. 
   Mmm! 
  Your Nanima taught you well. 
   Do you see her often? 
   Not for a few years. 
   We had a falling out. 
   How heartbreaking. 
  What happened? 
   When my parents split,  Nanima wanted me to go to India  with her and my mom. 
   I wanted to stay, go to Tisch,  and become the next Spike Lee. 
   She never forgave you? 
   She tried to bribe me, with an early inheritance,  but... 
   [POUNDING ON DOOR] 
   - Be right back. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
   Didi! 
  What a surprise! 
   You've been avoiding my calls. 
   We need to talk. 
   Um... 
  can it wait? 
   - I have company. 
  - The Palace found out  that I helped you, and they fired me. 
   I am so sorry. 
   I helped you get out of the hotel,  I loaned you money, and you ghost me? 
   I thought we were friends. 
   We are. 
  We are friends. 
   I recently  came into a new business relationship,  and I'm expecting a big payday. 
   So as soon as the money comes in,  I will pay you twofold. 
  I promise. 
   If you don't, I'm going to the police. 
   So, Papi, when am I gonna see one of your drag concerts? 
   At this point, probably never. 
   I just found out I lost my spot. 
   ¿Y porqué? 
  What happened? 
   Because Molly's is hosting some stupid drag pageant,  and now my slot goes to whatever fame-thirsty queen  has the tightest tuck. 
   Okay, cálmate. 
   Being angry isn't going to win your spot back. 
   Show these queens who they're messing with. 
   I'm an artist, okay? 
   Broadway wouldn't give me a stage,  I made my own at Molly's,  You still can. 
  Once you win. 
   Pageantry is in the Lopez blood. 
   I was Miss Puerto Rico, remember? 
   Of course, Mommy, but all the queens  have been preparing all week. 
  I'm too far behind. 
   Well, it's a good thing you have me to help. 
  Hmm? 
   Come on. 
  Let's win you that corona. 
   [JORGE] 
  Aye. 
   - Off we go. 
  Vamos. 
  - All right. 
   On behalf of all of Lacy's, we're delighted to host  your royal engagement announcement photoshoot. 
   The photographer, Will Buckingham,  will be set up here tomorrow morning,  Actually, Errol's grandmother had concerns  that Will Buckingham is too green. 
   Grandmother is also a tyrant. 
   [LAUGHS] 
   Patricia's just a tad nervous. 
   [KATY] 
  Well, I heard that Vogue  just promised Will Buckingham the September issue cover. 
   So, if anyone's going to make you look like a princess,  - it's him. 
  - [PATRICIA] 
  Okay. 
   I trust you, Katy, but... 
   shouldn't we consult your family about aesthetic... 
   what if they don't approve? 
   Pattie, please. 
   Can we just have one thing to ourselves? 
   Shouldn't you... 
  maybe.. 
  okay. 
   Katy, you understand the importance of this wedding. 
   I do. 
  Lacy's is planning  an exclusive collection and window  inspired by the royal nuptial. 
   Yet, there's clearly trouble in paradise. 
   Seeing that you have a way with the prince,  whatever's going on, you need to fix it. 
   Absolutely. 
  I am happy to. 
   Gloria, I know this might literally be the worst time,  but I've been trying to find out if my mother,  Katherine Keene, was ever a Lacy's employee? 
   The dragon lady in payroll  refused to release any information. 
   Your timing could not be worse. 
   But if this is the fastest way  to get you out of my office  and onto this royal kerfuffle,  I'll look into it. 
  Now, off you go. 
   Thank you.

   Oh, my God! 
   Alex, this... 
  this is amazing. 
   I can't believe you mixed this! 
   I guess I'm more than a pretty face. 
   All right, let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay? 
   At least not until after the listening party. 
   How nervous should I be? 
   Don't be. 
  You're amazing. 
   And tomorrow, some of the top music execs  will get to see that, including my dad. 
   And once he hears it,  he'll approve funding for a full album. 
   What's up? 
  Hmm? 
   Are you having second thoughts about us? 
   No! 
  No, no, no, it's not that. 
   It's just, my mom is flying in town for the listening party. 
   I just want everything to be perfect, you know,  because if it were up to her,  I would be in law school right now. 
   I thought your mom supported your singing. 
   Yeah! 
  No, I... 
   Once upon a time, but she has her doubts,  and I just... 
  I want her to see that I'm doing well... 
   for once. 
   Well, you heard it yourself. 
   Look, the EP is solid. 
   They're gonna love it.

   Molly's is my bar, bitch. 
   Please. 
   This dump needs a real queen. 
   Instead of little boys playing dress-up  in Holly Hobbie's hand-me-downs. 
   But I wouldn't be caught dead in those,  especially not in front of the legendary Miss VeeVee Humble. 
   Hold up. 
  VeeVee gonna be at the pageant? 
   She's the special guest judge. 
   And I'm her kind of queen... 
   fierce, fabulous,  and filet-o-fishy. 
   Mm. 
  Try not to embarrass yourself. 
   Drag ain't Broadway,  and you couldn't even cut it there. 
   [SNAPS] 
   [KATY] 
  As I struggled to figure out  how to mend Errol and Patricia's royal relationship,  the world threw me the ultimate curveball. 
   And I was reminded of the one relationship I couldn't fix. 
   Where exactly did Xandra touch K.O.? 
   I don't want to think about it. 
   I gotta say, I didn't see those two coming. 
   Turn. 
   Maybe they met at Studio 34,  because he's working there now. 
   I just can't believe that he's already  in a new relationship... 
  with a Cabot! 
   [JORGE] 
  And I'm not seeing any signs of K.O. 
   on Xandra's Gram. 
   - Maybe they just hookin' up. 
  - [GASPS] 
   That's not helping. 
   Regardless of what... 
  or who... 
   K.O. 
  is doing, maybe this is a sign  that you should get back on the proverbial horse. 
   You're right. 
  I'm gonna do a rebound. 
   - [GASPS] 
  - How titillating. 
  But with whom? 
   I don't know any other straight guys besides K.O... 
   - Hmm. 
  - and my brothers. 
   - Absolutely not. 
  - [JOSIE] 
  Hello, I'm home! 
   Hey! 
   Ooh! 
  There is a certain photographer,  quite a catch, who's working at Lacy's tomorrow. 
   - A certain Will Buckingham. 
  - [JOSIE] 
  Guys, really?! 
   My mom is on her way from Grand Central as I speak! 
   I was soaking it, I'll clean it now. 
   - Thank you. 
  - [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
   [KNOCKING] 
   Mom! 
   Four flights, Josie. 
   And this neighborhood! 
   There's a transient man on your stoop  who claims to be Rudy Giuliani. 
   [JOSIE CHUCKLES] 
   [BOTH LAUGHING] 
   - Oh! 
  - Mmm! 
   [SIGHS] 
  Oh. 
   You must be  Katy, Pepper and Jorge. 
   - Hi! 
  - Hi! 
   I've heard all about you. 
   Thank you for taking care of my daughter. 
   Josie is the best thing to happen to 4B  since we got rid of those mice. 
   I will shut up now. 
   This must be your living room-slash-bedroom. 
   It's so... 
  sea foam green. 
   So, fill me in. 
   I want to know everything that's going on. 
   Patricia wanted a change in direction... 
   the regality of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. 
   So... 
  we pulled contemporary Victorian. 
   Pattie and I agreed, Oxfords and chinos. 
   What's wrong with that? 
   Okay. 
   Hi. 
   [GASPS] 
  You look perfect! 
   Okay, so, Errol is... 
   confused. 
  He was hoping for something... 
   - more casual? 
  - Katy. 
   If you could tell Errol, I had a chat with his father... 
   Who wants the pictures hung between  his bed chambers and private parlor. 
   Khaki wasn't formal enough. 
   We could pull you something with less ruffles? 
   We agreed to avoid this stiff, insufferable nonsense. 
   Tell her... 
   He wants JFK Jr., not Prince,  and definitely not Purple Rain Prince. 
   It's like he wants the whole world  to see Pat the bartender from the East Village! 
   Remember, Errol fell in love with that bartender. 
   But I promise you, when people look at you,  they will see a princess. 
   To Patricia, your world is huge  and intimidating. 
   She just wants to be a princess  for her prince. 
   I already see her as a princess. 
   She doesn't need to prove it with clothes. 
   I have an idea. 
  Don't move. 
   [WHISPERING] 
   I like it. 
   And... 
  cut! 
  Let's take five. 
   [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
   Raj, I was just thinking... 
   your Nanima, was it? 
   I can't imagine how much you miss her. 
   Have you ever thought about reaching out? 
   I was in a dark place when my family disowned me. 
   I just don't think I'm ready to forgive them. 
   I'm sorry. 
   I don't mean to put my problems on you,  but I've never really had the best relationship  with my family, and sometimes  it really pains me how much I miss them. 
   I'd hate for you to feel the same way. 
   Life's too short to hold grudges, you know? 
   Just think about it, will you? 
   Looks great. 
   - Okay. 
  - [CREW MEMBER] 
  Um... 
   Yeah? 
   [WILL] 
  Beautiful, guys. 
   Stay just like that. 
  Hold it, hold it. 
   - [SHUTTER CLICKS] 
  - All right. 
   Now, let's get some  with just the princess-to-be, shall we? 
   [KISSES] 
   Good job having them dress down. 
   These'll be killer, thanks to you,  - Uh... 
  - [ERROL] 
  Katy Keene. 
   Thank you for helping us. 
   Who knew being engaged while royal  could be so stressful? 
   Making decisions as a couple is always hard. 
   That's right. 
   You recently got engaged? 
   Actually, that didn't work out. 
   I'm sorry to hear it. 
   He must be a puddle, losing you. 
   Perfect, princess. 
   [GASPS] 
  Mommy! 
   Your Miss Puerto Rico costume! 
   I love it! 
   - Until I met Ginger, - [SNIFFLES] 
   I thought I'd have to be buried in this outfit. 
   Come on. 
  Let's get to work. 
   I have the perfect showstopper outfit for you. 
   Mama, Katy's gonna make my showstopper. 
   Bueno, pero, what about your Q&A? 
   Ma, it's fine, I'm just gonna be myself  - and speak my truth. 
  - Your truth? 
   You're in a pageant, you're not testifying in court. 
   Pageants are about fitting into the mold,  not breaking it, okay? 
   - [GROANS] 
  Aye... 
  - Come on. 
   Pretend you're onstage. 
   Okay, smile. 
   Smile. 
  Smile. 
   Pero, not too much, okay? 
   You look a little crazy. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Smile. 
   - Mm-hmm. 
  Okay, now posture... 
  - Mmm. 
   shoulders back, belly in, tatas out. 
   Eyes wide. 
   Stare those judges down. 
   What says... 
   "gold album maker"? 
   Well, it's not really a full album. 
   It's more of an EP. 
  It's four songs. 
   What matters is that a label  is putting their money and time behind your music. 
   Well, Mom, I'm not signed to a label. 
   Mr. 
  Cabot of Cabot Entertainment  funded it personally. 
   Mr. 
  Cabot, as in your manager's dad? 
   Yeah... 
   Um, actually,  Alex isn't just my manager,  he's my boyfriend. 
   But that is not uncommon in the industry. 
   I have a contract. 
   You signed a contract? 
   Without running it by me first? 
   I know what I'm doing. 
   Clearly not. 
   The father of your manager-slash-boyfriend  is funding your EP. 
   I don't want you to become a pawn in their family dynamics. 
   Ooh! 
  This was made for you. 
   I am not a pawn. 
   Is it so hard to believe  that Mr. 
  Cabot cut me a check  because he heard me sing? 
   Frankly... 
  yes. 
   You know, you used to believe in me. 
   What happened? 
   [FOOTSTEPS FADE] 
   [XANDRA] 
  Alex, I take full credit  for leaking the Kissing Cabots story. 
   Look, I'm sick and tired  of your dad trying to control us. 
   And now that is out there, we're free. 
   I'm done with secrets... 
   which is why I needed you to see this. 
   - This is Josie's contract. 
  - Yeah. 
   Your dad needs a way more competent secretary. 
   I took the liberty of highlighting that last clause. 
   It's a lot of legalese, so let me translate it for you. 
   Your daddy is paying for Josie to date you. 
   Or, should I say, baby-sit you. 
   [KATY] 
  Thank you so much. 
   It was cool to work with you, Katy Keene. 
   I'll remember your name next time I need a Switzerland. 
   You could remember my number, too. 
   Forward. 
  I like it. 
   My friend is having an EP release at five. 
   Do you wanna meet me there? 
   [CAMERA CLICKS] 
   Best photo I took all day. 
   Put in your number. 
   I'll see you later. 
   See ya. 
   Well done at the shoot today, Katy. 
  Errol and... 
   Pedestrian Patricia looked cheery. 
   Thank you, Gloria. 
  It was a team effort. 
   I got this from Human Resources. 
   Your mother's file. 
   She was indeed an employee here at Lacy's. 
   Wait. 
  It says here that she was fired. 
   - Why? 
  - From what I gather,  the management doubted her commitment to the store. 
   Why wouldn't my mom tell me that she worked here? 
   She was terminated around the time you were born. 
   Which I found in your file. 
   Why would she go to such lengths  to keep all this from me? 
   [PHONE BUZZES] 
   No doubt that's your date calling. 
   Honestly, I'm not really in the mood  to go out with anyone. 
   Katy, if your mother was keeping something from you,  it was likely to protect you. 
   Now go. 
  Don't keep that roguish Vogue photographer waiting. 
   Thank you, Gloria. 
   The party started twenty minutes ago. 
   [SIGHS] 
  Where's Alex? 
   Easy there. 
  It's New York. 
   [ENTRY BELL JINGLES] 
   Hi! 
  Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi! 
   Will, this is Josie McCoy,  future Grammy winner, right here. 
   [JOSIE AND WILL LAUGH] 
   Hi, thanks so much for coming. 
   - Of course. 
  - Um, so,  Jorge and Pepper are downstairs. 
   - I'll see you there? 
  Okay. 
  - Okay. 
   [REMOVES BOTTLE CAP] 
   [KATY] 
  Thanks. 
   - Cheers. 
  - [BOTTLES CLINK] 
   To an unusual first date. 
   Please, it reminds me of my early days in the city. 
   Running around with a camera on my shoulder,  not knowing if I'd ever make it. 
   I think nostalgia might be getting the better of you. 
   As much as I like my day job,  I would rather be getting paid to design. 
   Your day job can't be that bad with a prince pining after you. 
   - I saw the way he looked at you. 
  - What? 
   Prince Errol Swoon  is practically a married man. 
   He most certainly was not looking at me. 
   [SOFT POP MUSIC PLAYING] 
   Josie? 
   - You look amazing. 
  - Thanks. 
   I wasn't sure you were still coming. 
   I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
   So, where is this manager of yours? 
   [ALEXANDER] 
  He's right here. 
   Alexander Cabot. 
   The man my daughter hasn't stopped talking about. 
   It's my pleasure. 
   Um, Alex... 
   can I talk to you in private? 
   Hm. 
  What's the point? 
   [LOUDLY] 
  I mean, we should probably  call this whole thing off, don't you think? 
   You know? 
  Because you couldn't keep up  your end of the bargain. 
   What's he talking about, Josie? 
   I don't know. 
   I think he's just had  a little too much to drink. 
   Really? 
  You don't know? 
   So, you're not just dating me  because my dad paid you to? 
   Alex, I... 
  I can explain. 
   Save it. 
   Alex... 
   Jo... 
  Josie, let him go. 
   [KATY] 
  Hey, this is your night. 
   Do not let him ruin this. 
   [CHUBBY] 
  We all came out here tonight  for the same reason... 
   to hear good music. 
   And I'm honored to introduce  a bright young talent... 
   Miss Josie McCoy.

  And you guys? 
  It was the Worst. 
  Kiss. 
   Ever. 
   [PEPPER, JORGE] 
  No! 
   Oh, my God. 
   Welcome to the dating pool, sister. 
   Ugh! 
  That's nothing compared to the time  I went on a date with Jared Leto,  who only gives butterfly kisses. 
   Speaking of kisses... 
  how's Raj? 
   Have I mentioned how weird it is  that you're dating K.O.'s roommate? 
   You have, and we're not dating. 
   - It's strictly cash. 
  - [PHONE BUZZES] 
   Speaking of, I should probably take that. 
   Might be an emergency. 
   Uh-huh. 
  An emergency booty call. 
   Better make it quick. 
  Don't miss my pageant. 
   - [KATY SNORTS] 
  - I would never. 
   Two shakes of a lamb's tail! 
   [SIGHS] 
   Maybe I'm not cut out for the single life. 
   I mean, I had a prince in K.O. 
   Katy, girl, you've been single for, like, two seconds. 
   Relax. 
   You just gotta kiss a few frogs, is all. 
   - You're right. 
  - [CLINKS GLASSES] 
   [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
   Hmm. 
  Maybe Pepper forgot something. 
   Doesn't she have a key? 
   Yeah, I thought we gave her one. 
   So, how did you know where I lived? 
   I'm a prince, Katy. 
 
 
 
   [LAUGHS] 
  Right. 
   I'm sorry to drop in like this,  but I just didn't know where else to go,  and you always seem to have the right answers. 
   Patricia and I are over. 
   I called off the engagement. 
   You what?! 
   No, that's okay. 
  I can fix this. 
   No. 
  It's too late. 
  I'm done. 
   You know, on our first date,  I made plans to take Patricia  to a Michelin-star restaurant  in Macau, but she insisted  that we stay in and order Chinese. 
   Now she's throwing temper tantrums  because her tiara doesn't have enough  canary yellow diamonds. 
   Patricia is dealing with a lot. 
   She's not used to being in the public eye. 
   - Just give her some time. 
  - I don't know, Katy,  I think I might be better off single. 
   I know, I thought that too when I broke up with K.O.,  but trust me, the grass isn't always greener. 
   [KATY SIGHS] 
   Is this your mother? 
  You look like her. 
   Yeah. 
   You all right? 
   My mom was amazing,  and she died a few years ago,  but I'm starting to think that there's  a lot of things I don't know about her. 
   I'm sorry. 
   I lost my mum too when I was young. 
   - Yeah, I know. 
  - Of course. 
   The whole world knows. 
  I wish I could say that  you'll miss her less as time goes by,  but I find that the older I get, the more I wish she were here. 
   She'd know what to do about Patricia. 
   What do you think that she would say? 
   That I need to learn to be alone,  and that I was foolish to get engaged to my rebound. 
   - Oh. 
  - Did I forget to mention that? 
   - You did. 
  - I was heartbroken when I met Patricia. 
   I suppose I rushed into things to numb the pain I was feeling. 
   It's funny how we do that, isn't it? 
   Sometimes I think I stayed with K.O. 
   because he was there for me when my mom died. 
   I knew that if we broke up,  there would just be all this  residual pain to sort through. 
   - How's that going? 
  - Still sorting. 
   [JORGE] 
  Katy! 
   - I'm heading out. 
  - Okay. 
   Ask him. 
   Do you want to go to a drag pageant? 
   Uh... 
  I'm afraid I cause a bit of a commotion  - when I'm out in public. 
  - Oh! 
  Of course. 
   Here. 
  No one will be looking for a prince  amongst all those... 
  queens. 
   [CHUCKLES] 
   Go talk to your mother. 
   She's the only one you're gonna get. 
   I know what you're gonna say. 
   That this whole listening party was a disaster. 
   Josie, you were a revelation. 
   You've never sounded better! 
   Alex knows how to get the best out of me. 
   I know you can handle your business, but... 
   I didn't like what I saw tonight. 
   That was partially my fault. 
  I didn't... 
   Don't make excuses for that boy. 
   Alexander Cabot had no right  to waltz in here like that. 
   Do you know who he reminded me of? 
   Just because he had too much to drink one night... 
   doesn't mean he has a problem. 
   He's not Dad. 
   That's exactly the same thing I used to say. 
   Josie,  when you end up with someone like that,  the worrying never goes away. 
   I don't want that for you. 
   I know. 
   You are not that little girl  from Riverdale anymore. 
   And you have to make your own choices... 
   and mistakes. 
   But I'm still your mom. 
   And I will always be here  to help pick up the pieces and bring you home. 
   [SNIFFLES] 
   Should I be jealous of this other person  that you're clearly fantasizing about? 
   [CHUCKLES] 
  No. 
   It's just my Nanima. 
   I've been thinking about what you said,  and I think I might reach out to her. 
   Oh, that's fantastic... 
  isn't it? 
   I just don't know what I'll do if she rejects me again. 
   [PEPPER EXHALES] 
   Raj... 
   I must admit, I had a... 
   teensy, tiny, microscopic  ulterior motive when I suggested  that you make up with your family. 
   What are you talking about? 
   When I heard about your potential inheritance,  I thought that you might  invest in my Pepper Plant. 
   But you might be, quite literally,  the sweetest guy in the world,  and it would be unconscionable of me  to betray your trust. 
   I'm sorry that I even considered asking you. 
   Pepper, stop. 
   I can't believe you even thought of doing that. 
   [SOFTLY] 
  Yeah. 
   You're relentlessly passionate. 
   That's why I like you. 
   Look, I've done some shady things  to get films made,  and I've made some shady films. 
  [LAUGHS] 
   So next time... 
   don't lie to me? 
   Yeah. 
   [EMCEE] 
  Ladies and gentlemen,  welcome to the Miss Washington Heights pageant! 
   - [CLUB MUSIC PLAYING] 
  - Now joining us on the stage  - for the Q&A portion of the evening... 
  - Aye, papi... 
   - please welcome our guest judge... 
  - Tatas out! 
   the one, the only, the always horny,  VeeVee Hum-ble! 
   [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
   - Francois? 
  - No, sweetie. 
   But tell him to call me if he's single. 
   [KATY LAUGHS] 
   [CHEERS, APPLAUSE CONTINUE] 
   - You made it! 
  - Gosh, yes. 
   I could not have my mom come to New York  and not experience the drag scene. 
   [SIERRA] 
  Honey, I was in the East Village  every weekend of my twenties... 
  I know drag. 
   [VEEVEE] 
  Mm, yass! 
   These queens done dragged me out of retirement. 
   - [LAUGHTER] 
  - But there's no place I'd rather be. 
   [CROWD CHEERS] 
   And now for the Q&A portion of the evening. 
   The first question goes to Deveraux. 
   - [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
  - [FAN] 
  Deveraux! 
   [FAN 2] 
  Whoo! 
  Whoo! 
   What advice would you give to a young person  starting out in drag? 
   I'd tell them that if a kid from Paris, Texas,  could grow into the gorgeous, confident queen  standing here tonight, then anything is possible... 
   - if you believe in yourself. 
  - [FANS] 
  Whoo! 
  Whoo! 
   - And invest in a good corset. 
  - [LAUGHTER] 
   [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
   Ginger Lopez, same question. 
   [CHEERS, WOLF CALLS] 
   Thank you. 
  Um... 
  I... 
   I'd say, um... 
   - [MIC FEEDING BACK] 
  - Uh... 
   [DEVERAUX] 
  Aww, poor Ginger. 
   Putty tat got her tongue. 
   - [LAUGHTER] 
  - [MAN] 
  Ooh... 
   We need an answer! 
   [MAN 2] 
  What is she wearing? 
   [WOMAN] 
  Bring back Deveraux! 
   - [MAN 3] 
  Deveraux! 
  - [MIC FEEDING BACK] 
   Sorry. 
   No, no, no. 
  I got this. 
  I got it. 
   Ginger? 
   Oh, my God! 
   Hey, what happened? 
   [GASPS] 
   That bitch Deveraux. 
   Katy, she's like the Tether from Us. 
   She cut... 
  my dress! 
   - I know how to fix this. 
  - Don't. 
  Don't bother, Katy. 
   No, you are not giving up. 
   It's over, girl. 
  I don't belong here. 
   Not with these perfect, fishy queens. 
   [ERROL] 
  Ginger... 
   My entire life,  I have been expected to be the perfect prince... 
   go to this school, marry that girl,  don't get a piercing. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
   But the more I tried, the more miserable I was. 
   See, the problem wasn't that I didn't know how to be a prince,  I just didn't know how to be myself. 
   Forget about what you think you're supposed to be,  and just be who you are. 
   I could kiss you right now. 
   But that's probably inappropriate. 
   - [KATY CHUCKLES] 
  - We'll see where the night takes us. 
   [BOTH LAUGH] 
   For the talent portion of our competition,  let's welcome back to the stage, Miss Ginger Lopez!

  As a former Miss Washington Heights,  it's wonderful to see the next generation  of queens on the rise. 
   Now, without further ado... 
   [CROWD CHUCKLES] 
   our first runner-up... 
   Miss Booty Harland!

   So, is every night in the life  of Katy Keene this exciting? 
   You mean, between the evil drag queens  and the musical numbers? 
   Yes, it's pretty standard. 
   I truly cannot remember  the last time I had this much fun. 
   Seriously? 
   You are a literal prince. 
   You get to attend fancy galas  and brunch with the Obamas. 
   Just Michelle and the girls. 
   Barry's not one for mimosas. 
   [LAUGHS] 
   I mean it, though. 
   It's so hard to cut loose when you're in the public eye. 
   Well, look around. 
   Molly's Crisis is one of the few places in New York  where you can totally be yourself  and not feel alone. 
   So show me what you've got, Your Highness.

   Good mornTing, Your Highness. 
   What happened to your prince? 
   - He couldn't stay. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
   How was the royal treatment? 
   - I don't know how that happened. 
  - [JOSIE] 
  Mmm. 
   We just got caught up in the moment. 
  It was a mistake. 
   [GASPS] 
  He's a client! 
   - [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
  - Ooh! 
   K.O. 
   Hi. 
   Katy. 
  Uh... 
   I was in the area and I came by to pick up some of my stuff. 
   If it's a bad time, I can come back later. 
   No. 
  No, it's okay. 
   Do you want some cereal? 
   So... 
  I saw you and Xandra together. 
   Are you guys... 
   And if you are, that is great. 
   Xandra's kind of a monster but if you like her,  I am happy for you. 
  Really. 
   Katy, take a breath. 
   Xandra and I met at Studio 34. 
   She needed a bodyguard, so I drive her around  and I'm teaching her to box. 
  That's it. 
   Oh. 
   You were jealous. 
   - No. 
  No... 
  - Yes.. 
   - [LAUGHING] 
  - No, no. 
  I was not. 
   You totally were! 
  I mean... 
   - Come on. 
  - Come on. 
   Katy, seriously though, I can't even imagine  dating somebody new right now. 
   I'm not ready. 
   - [PHONE BUZZES] 
  - Oh. 
   - I see some things never change. 
  - Sorry. 
   - Hello? 
  - [GLORIA] 
  Katy, I don't know  what you did this time,  but I need you in my office now. 
   Thank you for coming by, Didi. 
   I didn't want to do this on the phone. 
   You don't have the money, do you? 
   My business deal fell through. 
   It got complicated. 
  I'm sorry. 
   But, I do have something else for you. 
  A job. 
   A job? 
  Where? 
   Right here at the Pepper Plant. 
   And as an added incentive, I can offer you  a week's salary in advance. 
  Cash. 
   I really value your friendship, Didi. 
   - I don't want to lose you. 
  - Hmm. 
   People like you came in and out of the Palace Hotel every day. 
   I know what you are, Pepper. 
   A con artist. 
   I accept your job offer, under one condition. 
   I want you to teach me everything you know. 
   I'm glad you called. 
   After last night, I didn't expect you to. 
   Alex, I am so sorry. 
   I never should have signed that contract  without talking to you first. 
   All my life, I've watched my dad persuade people  to do things they didn't want to do. 
   You don't have to apologize. 
   I do. 
   Are you okay? 
   Josie... 
   I'm an addict. 
   But I'm working on it, every day. 
   I met with my sponsor this morning. 
   And I'll keep doing so. 
   You don't have to worry  about baby-sitting me. 
   I just wish you had told me. 
   Not because you need to be taken care of,  but because I care about you. 
   And for the record, with or without  a contract, I want to be with you. 
   You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. 
   My dad ruins a lot of things,  but not this. 
   I won't let him. 
   I'd like a Shirley Temple, please. 
   With vodka. 
   I like your style. 
  Comin' right up. 
   Katy mentioned I could find you here. 
   You were a breath of fresh at the pageant yesterday. 
   Thanks. 
  Still didn't win. 
   Now I'm stuck with the dreaded Wednesday 6 P.M. 
  slot. 
   A show no one will ever see. 
   You may not have won the crown,  but you were the only real queen on that stage. 
   You were authentic. 
   I may not know what kind of queen Ginger is yet,  but I know who I am. 
   It's on me. 
   Once upon a time, I was you. 
   New to the drag scene. 
   A little lost. 
   I would have killed for a fairy dragmother. 
   How about I help you navigate  these fishy, piranha-infested waters? 
   You want to be my drag mom? 
   It would be an honor. 
   And by the time I'm done with you,  your dreaded slot will become the best drag show in NYC. 
   - [LAUGHS] 
  - So... 
   what do you want it to be? 
   It can be anything. 
   I want to do "Kiss of the Spider Woman". 
   A one-queen musical. 
   Then we'll make it so. 
   Hi. 
   Patricia, what... 
  what's going on? 
   You dressed me the first time  that I shopped at Lacy's with Errol. 
   You designed my engagement ring. 
   You planned our photo shoot. 
   I have always trusted you. 
   So that's why I have to ask you, Katy... 
   ... would you design my wedding dress? 
   [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
   [NERVOUS LAUGH] 
   [KATY] 
  That's when I knew... 
   I was royally screwed.
