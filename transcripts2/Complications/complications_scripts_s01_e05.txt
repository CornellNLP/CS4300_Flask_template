 John : Previously on  Complications... 
 Dacy : The boy you saved was shot by members of Norteños Locos. 
 They're in a turf dispute with a rival gang, the Vine City Crew. 
 The Locos put out a hit on the gang leader's son. 
 That boy you saved... is everything to me. 
 Darius : You see that man right there? 
 He a doctor. He got your back. 
 He gonna make sure you safe. 
 I found a place to move Antoine, but I need money. 
 35,000 today. 
 Yeah, we can get it. 
 It's messed up, coming in here, taking our cash. 
 Enough! That is enough! 
 What you doing? Hey, but just remember. 
 You ain't the only doctor in Atlanta. 
 I hurt you, Sam, and I'm sorry. 
 CJ : So why don't you get in then? 
 'Cause I don't even know your name. 
 Well, I'm CJ. 
 I got something for you. 
 [all screaming] 
 Park it. 
 [indistinct shouts in distance] 
 Hey, Dee, what up, yo? You want to hit this? 
 Where's Easy? 
 He's in the back, yo. 
 [hip-hop music playing] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Yo, how long that took? 
 No time, the boy's a natural. 
 CJ : Man, why you always make the sneakers so big? 
 Makes me tall enough to dunk. 
 Slam it down like LeBron. 
 LeBron? 
 I thought you was supposed to be a Hawks fan. 
 The Hawks don't got the King. 
 [laughter] 
 Easy, you got a sec? 
 Show Dee what you did, son. 
 Oh, not bad, little man. 
 You got some skill. 
 We need to talk. This deal you took... 
 Dee, you see who's standing here? 
 Where you thinking about hanging this one up? 
 Thought you could take it with you. 
 I don't think I can. 
 But how about you draw me in here? 
 Have me posted up in the paint. 
 You can put it in your room, and when you look at it, you know your old man is with you, just waiting for you to dish me the rock. 
 Hmm? 
 Why don't you give me and Dee a minute here, all right? 
 Have your cousin get you something from the grill. 
 Hey, come on, 'Toine. 
 I'm gonna get you a burger the size of your head. 
 [chuckles] 
 Come on, man. 
 I heard about this deal. It's a joke. 
 Lawyer said a deal is the way to go. 
 Bullshit. 
 You ain't never had no gun on you. 
 We always careful over the phone 'cause they always tapped. 
 DA got nothing. 
 He got enough. 
 That don't mean it's settled. 
 You call the lawyer, you tell him that you gonna fight this. 
 It's over with. 
 Trial ain't nothing but a distraction. 
 With the Locos crowding our turf, people need to focus on they business. 
 So you just gonna hide in jail while these folks fend for themselves? 
 I'm doing this to protect them. 
 By giving up? 
 How we gonna keep this going with you locked up? 
 You think Spider know how to keep the Locos in check? 
 Spider? Hell you talking about? 
 I ain't handing my business over to no hot boy. 
 You, Darius. You. 
 Look around you. 
 All these people, they your responsibility now. 
 You gotta take care of them. 
 You put money in their pockets, you put food on their tables. 
 No, I don't know, man. 
 Lot of the older cats ain't gonna like this. 
 They'll do what I say. 
 I chose you because I need someone who's gonna be smart when sh1t goes cross-eyed. 
 And believe it, Dee, that day is gonna come. 
 And when it does, it's all down to you. 
 [dramatic music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 You know what my favorite part of this is? 
 Hmm? 
 When we're together, it's sort of like the world just slips away, like we stepped out of time and there's no past or future. 
 It's just us. 
 Sounds wonderful. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [both chuckle] 
 It is. 
 [phone vibrates] 
 Ugh. 
 [sighs] 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's the hospital. [clears throat] 
 This is Dr. Ellison. 
 Uh-huh. 
 How many? 
 Yeah, I'm on my way. 
 What is it? 
 It's, uh, nothing for you to worry about. 
 They don't call you at this hour for nothing. 
 There's been a gang shooting. 
 The ambulances are on their way in. 
 Are you kidding me? No, you can't. 
 John, this is not a good time for you to be around gang members. 
 They're not gang members when they're in the hospital, they're patients. 
 No... 
 I have to go. 
 I know. I know. 
 Just be careful. 
 I'm gonna call you. 
 Don't. You should sleep. 
 No, I'm not gonna be able to sleep until I hear your voice and I know that my husband is okay. 
 Just pick up. 
 I will. 
 Okay. 
 [sirens wailing] 
 [overlapping indistinct chatter] 
 [grunts] 
 man : Hey, we need another Gurney over here! 
 Sir, sir, you cannot come through here! 
 I'm a doctor. 
 woman : Medical personnel only! 
 Bridget : Start another large Bore IV and get a pressure dressing. 
 What happened? 
 Gang shot up a burger place. 
 Retaliations spill out everywhere. 
 I got this one. You get that one, and then you're on triage. 
 man : Watch your back! 
 man : Hey, clear these ambulances now! Let's go! 
 What's his status? 
 Early 20s, male. 
 Single gunshot wound to the chest. 
 How long ago? 
 45 minutes. 
 Took a while for the police to clear the scene. 
 He flatlined, we hit him with Bicarb and three rounds of Epi. 
 Hold CPR so I can check for a pulse. 
 No pulse. 
 Uh... guys? 
 There's another entry wound back here. 
 Right pupil fixed and dilated, brain stem's herniating. 
 How long since you started CPR? 
 Going on 12 minutes. 
 No, that's it. He's gone. 
 I'm gonna call it. Time of death 23:45. 
 [bong] 
 [sighs] 
 [overlapping indistinct chatter] 
 How many more coming in? 
 At least three. 
 See if any will divert to county. 
 They're getting hit just as hard. 
 All right, but if they send us any more, we'll have to go on diversion. 
 Come on! 
 [grunts] 
 Hey! Take that sh1t outside! 
 You gotta be kidding me. 
 We need a set of Coags on bed 17. 
 All right. 
 Excuse me, Doctor. 
 Detective Robert Holden, gang task force. 
 I heard you're handling triage. 
 Well, I'm trying to, yes. 
 Hey, grab some IV stands from the in-patient ward. 
 We're running out. 
 Right away, Doctor. 
 Listen, I know you're busy, but we need our gang population as dispersed as possible. 
 We've done this before. We try to keep rivals apart. 
 I'm not just talking about fights. 
 I don't want friends collaborating on alibis either. 
 That's more your department than mine, but we'll do what we can. 
 Tonight will go a lot smoother if we're all on the same page. 
 Doctor? 
 If you see something that doesn't sit right, you let me know. 
 You got it, Detective. 
 Get your hands off me! 
 I'm not done talking to him! 
 Let's go! 
 Holden : Where do you think you're going? 
 Welcome to the party. 
 Look, we got patients pouring in as fast as we can write them up, and I'm out of beds. 
 Okay, maybe medicine can stash the drunk in 7 in the obs unit. 
 See? I'm here two seconds, I'm already making your life better. 
 Any way you can make another three or four patients disappear? 
 Working on it... whoa. 
 What... hey! 
 Hurrying turns doctors into patients. 
 Watch yourself. 
 Sorry. 
 What's his story? 
 17-year-old bystander, shot in the back. 
 We tubed him when he went into respiratory distress. 
 BP 80 palp, pulse 116. 
 Okay, get this kid into 14. 
 There's a trauma surgeon on his way. 
 Check his H and H and bolus him with 2 liters of normal Saline. 
 Hey... want to tell me what happened? 
 Yeah, I cut myself shaving. 
 Well, you're lucky it's just a graze. 
 We'll get someone to stitch you up as soon as we can, okay? 
 You making me wait? 
 Thought you was tight with us. 
 Excuse me? 
 You were in my hood, rolling with Dee up at Gizmo's. 
 Theo : That don't buy me nothing in here? 
 Uh, you must have me confused with someone else. 
 Don't play me, man. 
 I can't be sitting here all damn night. 
 Why don't you do me a solid and fix me up, Doc? 
 You want help? Hear this. 
 You don't know me. 
 I am a doctor, you are a patient. 
 You got that? 
 [indistinct radio chatter] 
 Everything okay here, Doctor? 
 Yeah, we're fine. 
 Matt : Officer! 
 Officer, please! 
 [Luis grunts] 
 Get off me, man! 
 Police brutality and sh1t! 
 Shut your damn mouth. 
 Ah! 
 Stay down! 
 This is bullshit! 
 Okay! 
 Everyone calm down. 
 My arm's broken. 
 Yeah? 
 Thanks for sharing your medical opinion, Doctor. 
 Mind if I take a look? 
 [winces] 
 Yup, it's broken. 
 Can't just up and arrest me. 
 I ain't even involved. 
 Don't care. Let's get him up to X-ray. 
 Have them do AP and lateral views of the forearm. 
 I need help with bed 22! 
 Hey, hey, hey, will you be still? 
 I'm fine. 
 Maybe, maybe not. 
 But that's what we gotta figure out, okay? 
 Now let me help you. 
 I don't want your help. 
 I want my phone call. 
 You'll get it soon as the doctor clears you to go downtown. 
 What's the... What's the story with this one? 
 Geismer : One of the shooters. 
 Opened fire on two guys in a drive-through and started this whole thing. 
 Tried to escape on foot, but then some bangers ran her down with their car. 
 Okay then. 
 I guess we know who's in my prayers tonight. 
 Gretchen let's get that blood drawn. 
 Don't touch me, bitch! 
 Let me do my job or I'll have the doctor zonk you. 
 Quentin : That's right. 
 You ever tried to make a phone call on Haldol? 
 It is tough, okay? You just drool and then you just kind of stare in space. 
 Is that what you want, huh? 
 I didn't think so. 
 All right, now... any pain here? 
 How about here? 
 Mm-mm. 
 Cop said you got hit by a car. 
 That right? 
 Yeah. 
 Guess you should have been running faster, huh? 
 Watch yourself,  puta. 
 Quentin : Ladies, claws away. 
 How about here? Any pain through here? 
 No? 
 All right, well, she's not complaining of any discomfort. 
 That's a good sign. 
 We'll double-check a few things. 
 If nothing comes up, she's yours. 
 You're all set. Someone will be right with you. 
 Zoey, let Dr. Farkas know that this one's ready for surgery. 
 On it. Bed 29 is next up. 
 Uh, can Dr. Sherman take this one? 
 Patient asked for you by name. 
 Said that you'd treated him before. 
 Sounds like he's a big fan. 
 Holden : You know how this is gonna shake out, Darius. 
 First guy to talk gets a pass. The rest get screwed. 
 Can't help you, man. 
 I might have to beat the bushes, but somebody's gonna talk to me. 
 Why not you? 
 Is there a problem here? 
 Dr. Ellison, glad you're here. 
 My friend needs medical attention. 
 Well, you'll have to wait outside, Detective. 
 It's policy. 
 You find a 9-millimeter bullet in that leg, I'll be back for round two. 
 Ain't against the law to get shot. 
 You ain't got sh1t on me. 
 You wanna... you want to swab my hands for gunshot residue? 
 You won't find nothing 'cause I ain't done nothing. 
 Every asshole on the street thinks he's a goddamn CSI now. 
 Have fun with this one, Doctor. 
 What the hell were you thinking? 
 Asking for me by name? 
 Who else I'm gonna ask for? Now listen. 
 There's a dude out there got brought in with me. 
 I need you to go talk to him. 
 No. I'm here to look at your leg. 
 The leg can wait. 
 That's it. I'm getting another doctor. 
 Oh, Doc, you just think about that before you walk away. 
 Boys in here know you. They know where your family at. 
 What you think happens if I tell 'em you ain't a friend no more? 
 Are you threatening me? 
 What you gonna do? 
 Bring the cop back in, 'cause if I go down, you go down with me. 
 Davis, I want you to cover this section and don't move! 
 What do you want? 
 The brother I need you to talk to, his name is Maddox. 
 He don't carry no ID, do you gonna have to scout. 
 Skinny dude, neck tattoo, shot twice, took a nasty fall over a railing. 
 You ask Maddox if he talked to Spider. 
 Then you tell me what he says. 
 And Doc, hurry up. 
 This night can get a lot worse for you, trust me. 
 Thanks. 
 We need to talk. 
 Then talk. 
 Not here. 
 Doctor, I have five patients waiting... 
 Gretchen... please. 
 This way. 
 Okay, I need you to find a patient for me. 
 He's got two GSWs and possible contusions from a fall. 
 Is this for your friend in bed 29? 
 I saw "Darius Bishop" on the board. 
 You shouldn't even be talking to him with... 
 Do you think I want to? If we don't find this patient, Darius could cause some very serious problems for both of us. 
 sh1t! 
 How many gunshot wounds? 
 Two. 
 Stab wound? 
 No, I don't think so. 
 Tattoo on the front of his neck? 
 Yes, that sounds right. 
 He's in bed 24. 
 Good luck talking to him alone. 
 Dr. Harper's working on him right now. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Listen, I just heard some news about your patient I thought you should know. 
 Seems he took a header right after he was shot. 
 Have you done a neuro exam or... 
 Unh-uh. I've been busy plugging leaks. 
 Uh-huh? You mind if I take a look? 
 Yeah, be my guest. 
 But you might have trouble assessing his mental status. 
 He was squirrelly when they brought him in. 
 I hit him with Ativan. 
 Hadn't been that talkative since. 
 Quentin : Feel free to give it a shot though. 
 Sir, I'm gonna check your head for possible contusions here. 
 Sir? 
 Sir! 
 [sighs] 
 Can I get out of here? How long is this gonna take? 
 Seems like you're in a big hurry to go to jail. 
 I just... I want my phone call. 
 I told them I had to call Elio. 
 I think your phone call should be to a lawyer, not your boyfriend. 
 Those Vine City bitches killed my boyfriend. 
 Elio's my little brother. He's seven years old. 
 And you left him alone? 
 Ain't got nobody else to take care of him. 
 I just want to make sure he's okay. 
 Maybe you should have thought about that before you shot two guys. 
 Maybe you should mind your own goddamn business. 
 You don't know nothing about my brother. 
 I know you're not doing him any good by being in here. 
 Bitch, everything I do is for... 
 [winces] 
 What is it? 
 Nothing. 
 I'm just done talking. 
 Have you seen Dr. Harper? 
 He's dealing with a GSW like everyone else. Why? 
 I think the girl in bed 6 is gonna need a CT scan. 
 Ah, the trigger-happy  Loca? 
 Yeah, I'll let Dr. Harper know when he has a second. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 X-rays are back. 
 The bone is basically shattered. 
 Yeah? Hurts like hell. 
 We'll get you something for the pain. 
 You'll need surgery. 
 Might take eight to ten weeks to heal. 
 Hey, how long you worked here for? 
 A long time. 
 I knew it. 
 You were my doctor before, right? 
 I don't know. Get a lot of people in here. 
 It was like six years ago. 
 Messed up my ankle at football camp. 
 You said you did the same thing playing... tennis? 
 What school was it again? 
 Stanford. 
 [chuckles] That's right. 
 You said to keep practicing 'cause you wanted to see me out there in my cardinal and white. 
 [chuckles] 
 [sighs] 
 You should have stuck with football. 
 I tried. 
 You know, maybe... 
 Keep moving. 
 Maybe things would be different... 
 Hey! We gonna finish this, you little piece of sh1t! 
 Try it! 
 Would you get him out of here? 
 Come on... hey! 
 Ah! 
 [bone snaps] Ow! 
 [grunting] 
 [overlapping shouting] 
 
 
 
 man : Get him out! 
 woman : Hey, we need some help over here! 
 Right there. 
 Stop! 
 Let's go! 
 [grunts] 
 Back up! 
 Get him out of here! 
 Dr. O'Neill? 
 Check his airway! 
 Sherry : Let's get her some help, please. 
 [gasping] 
 [grunts] 
 Yeah, we should probably get him in for a head CT. 
 I mean, there's no visible contusions, but just to be safe. Can you put the order in? 
 Sure. Hey, and listen, man. 
 Thank you. I really appreciate the help. 
 Aw, no problem. 
 [rapid beeping] 
 He's in V-tach? 
 Huh. 
 Pulse is fine. Must be the damn monitor again. 
 It could have been a bad connect... 
 No, I've had trouble with this one before. 
 Would you mind trying to find me a machine that actually will tell me if someone's about to die? 
 I'll get you a portable unit. 
 Thank you. 
 Come on, come on, wake up. 
 Can you hear me? 
 Huh? 
 Focus. 
 [groans] Ah, it hurts. 
 Where am I? 
 You're in a hospital. 
 Darius Bishop wants me to ask you a question. 
 He wants to know about Spider. 
 Did you talk to him? 
 [groans] 
 Listen to me. 
 Did you talk to Spider? 
 He's gone, man. 
 Gone? What do you mean "gone"? 
 He's dead. 
 Them dudes shot him in the street. 
 What the hell took you so long? 
 Your friend was unconscious, so I woke him up. 
 He said Spider's dead. 
 [screams] 
 What? What are you doing? 
 I gotta get out of here. 
 No, the ED is full of cops. 
 You got a bullet in your leg. 
 Don't matter. 
 I gotta get in touch with my boys. 
 You need to talk to someone, I'll get you a phone. 
 Something like this go down, ain't nobody answering no damn phone. I gotta go now. 
 If you think I'm gonna let you walk out of here to get some kind of payback, it's not gonna happen. 
 It ain't like that. 
 'Cause I'll just go tell a detective... 
 Doc, I said it ain't like that. 
 Then what is it like? 
 I'm trying to stop folks from killing each other. 
 Spider was supposed to stop his boys from rolling on the Locos' turf. 
 If he gone, they gonna be out for blood. 
 I'm the only one can stop 'em. 
 I lost enough friends. 
 Give me a chance to make this right. 
 I saw you beat a man half to death barely 12 hours ago, and now you're talking about keeping the peace? 
 Doc, you don't have to believe me, but when the bodies start to roll in later on... 
 Not just bangers, but girlfriends, kids... 
 Oh, you gonna wish you did. 
 So, what do you say? 
 Excuse me, I-I need your help with something over here. 
 Sir, you need to talk to one of the other officers. 
 I'm standing a post. 
 I understand that, but my patient is cuffed, and I can't check for orthostatic hypotension until someone undoes those cuffs. 
 I can get you some help. 
 I don't have time for that. 
 I know you got a job to do, but in here, my job comes first. 
 Now, please. 
 Let's make this quick. 
 Hey, man, watch it. 
 [groaning] 
 Her heart is racing. How long has she been like this? 
 She says she's okay. Doctor gave us a thumbs-up. 
 Means Sarita and I have a date at the station. 
 [groans] 
 If you're in a lot of pain, you need to tell me. 
 Back off. I'm getting out of here. 
 On our way, darling. 
 Did she sign these? 
 Yes. 
 man : All right, let's go. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 The MVA in 6... 
 You know the girl who shot those two guys? 
 Yes, yes. You know, I pushed for a CT scan, but she refused. 
 She doesn't want to our answer our questions, she doesn't want our help, there's nothing we can do. 
 Her abdominal pain is a lot worse. 
 It could be internal bleeding, it could be... 
 Listen, if the girl says she's fine, and she wants to go with the cops, what do you want me to do? 
 She wants to go with the cops because she wants to call her little brother. 
 If we make the wrong call here and it turns out to be something serious, he might not have a big sister anymore. 
 Let's take a look. 
 [sighs] 
 Hey, Detective? Detective, I need to... 
 I need to take a quick look at her. 
 You said she was okay. 
 Now I'm saying differently, okay? 
 Nurse Polk here has alerted me to a change in her physical exam and her vital signs. 
 I need to take a quick look at your side. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 [winces] Asshole! Stop! 
 She's got rigidity, some rebound tenderness, and tachycardic. 
 I am sorry to ruin your travel plans, but she may have an internal bleed. 
 Doctor, work with me here. We have medics at the station. 
 We've got an active investigation going on. 
 Hey, listen, unless Officer Geismer here is a trauma surgeon, your investigation's gonna have to wait. Let us work, please, thank you. 
 I need to talk to my little brother. 
 No. No, what you need is surgery. 
 He's not safe where he's at. Please. 
 Listen, I hear you, but right now, we gotta take care of whatever happened to your insides when that car hit you, okay? 
 We're gonna take good care of you, I promise. 
 Can we get her up to pre-op? I'll call surgery and let 'em know she's coming. Thank you. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 [phone line trills] 
 Ingrid : It's Ingrid, I'm not here. 
 Do your thing, and maybe I'll call you back. 
 [beep] 
 Hey, I was just thinking about you. 
 Wanted to call and make sure that you're okay. 
 Not that you ever pick up when you see your big sister's name on the phone. 
 Anyway, I'll talk to you later. Bye. 
 Then get bed 12 up to CT, and tell them we need the images here ASAP. 
 Thanks. 
 Darius? sh1t. 
 Had to stop, catch my breath. 
 Well, you're bleeding everywhere. 
 You can't stay here. Come on, let's go. 
 [grunts] 
 [Darius wincing] 
 God! Careful! 
 Gonna need to look at that wound. 
 No, we ain't got time for that. 
 You need to get me out of here. 
 What good is that if you bleed out five minutes after you leave? Hold still. 
 Ah! Damn. 
 [groans] 
 Ahh. 
 Well, that's not good. Swelling's increased. 
 [groans] I'll deal with it when I'm out. 
 No, no, no, that's... that's a hematoma, which means the bullet's pushing up against your artery. 
 Oh! [sighs and grunts] 
 No, we have to get you back to the ED, come on. 
 Are you crazy? 
 The cops gonna be all over me if I go back. 
 My boys are dying out there. 
 Fine. 
 Keep pressure on it and keep it elevated. 
 Wait, wait, wait, what you gonna do? 
 What do you think I'm gonna do? Gonna operate on your leg. 
 Gretchen? Gretchen, I need something else from you. 
 It's gonna be a bit. 
 It can't wait. 
 It's gonna have to. 
 I need to talk to you in private. 
 What happened? 
 Oh, I got caught between two gangbangers trying to beat each other to death. 
 It's dislocated. Gretchen's taking me to ortho so they can put it back in. 
 I will be down as soon as I can, but things are gonna get rough, now that we're down an MD. 
 I c... 
 Come on. 
 Okay. [winces] 
 You know what, let me... Let me look at the shoulder. 
 No, John. [groans] 
 You've got other patients. They can take me upstairs. 
 I dealt with a ton of these when I was a resident. 
 I can reduce your shoulder. It'll be a lot less painful than having Ortho put it back in, trust me. 
 I already tried to have someone... 
 Damn it, John, what the hell? 
 Won't work if you don't relax. Come on. 
 It won't work at all. I told you, Dan already tried. 
 Mm. You're making it worse. 
 Just wait a second. 
 [groans] 
 Trapezius. 
 Deltoid. 
 Bicep. 
 Repeat. 
 Yup, I took anatomy. Let go. 
 [bone pops] Ah! Ahh. 
 Oh. 
 sh1t. 
 There we go. 
 You might want to put an ice pack on that. 
 No. I'm fine. 
 I have to get back to work. 
 But, uh, thank you. That was... 
 Thanks. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, what now? 
 Need to remove a bullet from Darius's leg. 
 Need you to get me a laceration kit, Betadine, Saline, Lidocaine, and Morphine. 
 Okay, ask the nurse that's assigned to his bed. 
 Well, that's the thing, he's not in his bed. 
 He's in an empty room in the PT. 
 Jesus, who do you want me to sign the morphine out to? 
 [whispering] There's got to be a dozen people here who could use it. Just pick one. 
 I also need gauze and dressings... 
 Wait, shut up. 
 Gretchen, I'm serious now. 
 Doctor, stop talking. 
 Dr. Ellison, just the man I've been looking for. 
 We've got a missing patient. 
 Darius Bishop seems to have vanished out of his room. 
 I need to find out where he is, and I need to know now. 
 I'm just trying to understand how a half-naked man with a bullet in his leg waltzes out of an ER full of people. 
 People walk out of here every night. 
 It's our job to treat the patients, not to babysit them. 
 How far could he have gotten on that leg? 
 John : I really don't know. 
 Listen, I have patients that need my attention... 
 How long was he left in here alone? 
 I have no idea. I'm running around here tonight trying to do my job. I don't have time to do yours. 
 Doctor, you told me to get you if Mr. Mayfield needed to go to surgery. 
 He's showing signs of an intracranial hemorrhage. 
 Something you want to take a look at? 
 Yes. Yes, of course. 
 I have a patient. May I? 
 Yeah, fine, go. 
 I figured you wanted out of that conversation. 
 Yeah, good call. 
 Here. 
 Laceration kit, morphine, should be everything you need for a bullet and a bleed. 
 This should be enough. Gretchen, thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 [door opening] 
 Let me see it. 
 [grunts] 
 You can handle this? 
 Yeah, but I gotta warn you, I'm an Emergency Physician, not a trauma surgeon. 
 This could get ugly. 
 [groans] 
 Hey, what the hell you doing? 
 I can't have no drugs. I told you, I got work to do. 
 It's just morphine. Can't have you screaming, or everyone in the hospital is gonna know... 
 Hey! 
 I can't help nobody if my head ain't right. 
 No drugs. 
 Fine. 
 Well, at least let me inject the wound site with lidocaine. 
 Trust me, it's still gonna hurt plenty. 
 Deep breath. 
 [winces] 
 [winces] 
 [wincing] 
 Oof. 
 Remember, don't move. 
 If I hit an artery, this could get fatal real quick. 
 [winces] 
 Oh! That hurts like a moth... 
 Hold still. 
 Tell me something. 
 Am I the hardest patient you ever had? 
 You'd like to think that, huh? 
 [chuckles] 
 Come on, just help me out. 
 I'm trying to keep my mind off the pain. 
 Rebecca : Dad, dad, look. 
 John : Careful. 
 I'm being careful. 
 [Rebecca laughs] 
 The hardest? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 If you really want to know, the hardest was my daughter. 
 When she was eight, she came down with the flu. 
 Fever, chills. 
 I made sure she had plenty of fluids, plenty of sleep. 
 We talked about what the flu was and how it worked, and she even... [chuckles] 
 She made up a song about how the white blood cells were attacking the flu virus. 
 [Rebecca laughs] 
 Dad? 
 And then the nosebleeds started... and bruising. 
 When I saw the red spots on her skin, the petechiae... 
 I knew it wasn't the flu. 
 So I sent her to another physician who told her what I already knew. 
 That daddy was... wrong. 
 And that she had cancer. 
 She died six months later. 
 So no, you're not the hardest patient I ever had. 
 Not by a long shot. 
 Sorry, Doc. 
 [grunts] 
 [winces] 
 [grunts] 
 There it is. 
 Doc? 
 Give it here. 
 Busy night down there, huh? 
 Yeah, you could say that. 
 Hey, I was wondering, we sent a girl up with abdominal pain earlier, and I need to get some info on a family member. 
 They're working on her in 3. 
 She coded about 15 minutes ago. 
 Wait, what? 
 We were prepping her for surgery, and then all of a sudden... 
 Can't get a pressure. 
 No palpable pulse. 
 How long since the last epi? 
 Two minutes. 
 How many units has she had? 
 She's on her fourth unit now. 
 [voices indistinct and distant] 
 Farkas : Push 1 milligram Epi. 
 Epi's in. 
 [flatline tone] 
 Gibbs : No response. No shockable rhythm. 
 What do you want to do? 
 I'm calling it. Time of death, 2:45. 
 Thanks, everybody. We did what we could. 
 What happened? 
 Ultrasound was positive for a bleed, but she coded before we could get her into surgery. 
 Gina, will you notify? 
 It doesn't have any family listed. 
 She had a brother. I... 
 I think it was just the two of them. 
 This girl a friend of yours or something? 
 No, she was just... Just a patient. 
 Well, she's headed to the Fulton County ME for an autopsy. They can figure it out. 
 Could I... you mind if I do the paperwork? 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Be my guest. 
 Okay, this is as far as I go. 
 John : There's security cameras up here. 
 That's fine. Where we at? 
 So that's the west parking structure behind you. 
 Linden Avenue's on the other side. 
 All right. 
 Wait, wait. 
 If you've lied to me, and you go out there tonight and the shootings start again, you and I are gonna have a problem. 
 Yeah? 
 That sounded like a threat. 
 You made it clear that you can destroy me. 
 Well, guess what, I can destroy you too. 
 And if you make me an accessory to murder tonight... 
 I will. 
 I guess we together on one thing. 
 Enough people died tonight. 
 [phone vibrates] 
 Hey, honey. 
 Hey. Is this a good time? 
 Uh... 
 Yeah, sure. It's fine. 
 Are you sure? You're whispering. 
 Well, you know, it's late. People are sleeping. 
 Hmm. Well, no one's sleeping here. 
 Ollie had a bad dream, came downstairs. 
 Oh, he wants to say hi. 
 Hi, dad. 
 Hey, buddy. You had a nightmare? 
 Ollie : Yeah. We're watching TV. 
 Anything good? 
 Just nature stuff. Are you gonna be home soon? 
 [sighs] I hope so, but if I don't get home soon, can I count on you to make breakfast for Mom? 
 John : And save me some? 
 I will. Here's mom. 
 Hmm. 
 Hey. 
 So did everything work out okay with the... you know, the patients? 
 Samantha : Did you save some lives? 
 I hope so, Sam. I really do. 
 You're a good doctor, John Ellison. 
 [chuckles] I love you. 
 I love you too. 
 John : Bye. 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Yo, what's up? 
 [indistinct conversation] 
 Let's roll. 
 Hey, are you still busy, Doctor? 
 Oh, you know, we're getting through it. 
 John : After a night like that, I got a mountain of paperwork to do. 
 So, did things calm down? 
 Have there been any other shootings? 
 Haven't heard of any. We got lucky. 
 Glad to hear it. 
 All right, well, back to it. 
 Actually, Doctor, something I wanted to talk to you about. 
 Just got off the phone with a colleague. 
 I believe you know him, Detective Dacy? 
 We went over everything that went down tonight. 
 He mentioned that you were the one involved in that gang shooting the other day. 
 It must've been awkward for you having these guys in here tonight, what with you dropping one of them. 
 Anyone give you any trouble? 
 No. Not more than any other doctor. 
 A little hard to believe, considering. 
 I tell you what. 
 If you think of something I might want to know, you give me a call. 
 And it'd be best for everyone if you think really, really hard.
