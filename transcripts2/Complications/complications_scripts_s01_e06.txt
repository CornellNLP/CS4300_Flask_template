 Previously on Complications... 
 I like your ride. 
 CJ : So why don't you get in, then? 
 'Cause I don't even know your name. 
 Well, I'm CJ. 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 John : There's been a gang shooting. 
 I heard you're handling triage. 
 Well, I'm trying to, yes. 
 I need to talk to my little brother Elio. 
 He's not safe where he's at. Please. 
 [Flatline] 
 No response. 
 Calling it. Time of death, 3:45. 
 We are so screwed right now. 
 They're gonna find out we stole those records. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 We need to get rid of anything that leads back to us, Jed. 
 I got to get out of here. 
 No, the ED is full of cops. 
 You got a bullet in your leg. 
 I'm trying to stop folks from killing each other. 
 We got a missing patient. 
 Darius Bishop seems to have vanished out of his room. 
 I need to find out where he is now. 
 [Groans] 
 Oh. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, what's taking her so long? 
 I don't know, but I'm sure everything's fine. 
 Hey, you excited for your birthday dinner? 
 Yeah, do they still do the thing where they make the onion look like a volcano? 
 Ah, you know, I'll bet. 
 Look, I think I see a volcano. 
 Go check it out oh. 
 Wow. 
 Good evening. 
 Haley here said you booked one of our grill tables. 
 Yeah. 
 We're wondering if we could offer a table in our bar area. 
 Actually, we're really here to dine at a grill table. 
 Our reservation was for... 
 I understand. It's just, we're concerned the oxygen tank could be a safety hazard with the open flame. 
 You understand. 
 It's okay, we can... 
 No, no, no, no, that's all right. 
 Look, pal, this is this little girl's birthday. 
 Uh, we'd be happy to... to sit back from the grill a little? 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 I really can't. 
 Again, the bar area is pretty fantastic. 
 But we're not here to dine at the bar area. 
 We called about this weeks ago. 
 They said everything was fine. 
 Come here. 
 Do you have a moment? 
 John... 
 It's fine. 
 Okay. 
 Sir, we are here at our daughter's request. 
 It's her birthday. 
 And as you can see, she's a very sick little girl. 
 I understand, and if it wasn't for the fire hazard... 
 I'm not done. 
 You've got two choices... either sit us at a grill table, for which I will tip my server $200, or you can go ahead and invite us to sit at the bar area again, and as god is my witness, I will burn this place to the ground. 
 And then you'll have your fire hazard.

 You sure you said 6:30? 
 Of course I'm sure. 
 Maybe he misunderstood. 
 No, he didn't. I was very clear. 
 You understand that if we do not get this done before the morning shift starts, there is going to be major... 
 Here. 
 You were supposed to be here an hour ago. 
 Doc, who the hell is this? 
 Who the hell am I? 
 This is Nurse Polk. 
 John : She's gonna be doing your wound check with me. 
 That right? 
 How much she know? 
 She's just been helping me with Antoine, that's all. 
 We had a deal... 
 You and us. 
 [Car door closes] 
 Now, how I know she won't say nothing? 
 Seriously? 
 I've been waiting in an alley for an hour, and you're gonna ask if you can trust me? 
 Gretchen. 
 That kid would be dead if it wasn't for me, and the three of us would be in jail. 
 So, if you don't want to trust me, fine. 
 Get gangrene and die. 
 John : Darius... 
 It's all right. 
 She my kind of people. 
 Darius : I thought you said 'Toine was doing good in here. 
 He don't look so hot. 
 His wound is slightly infected, but we're dealing with it. 
 He just needs antibiotics and rest. 
 Gretchen : You better wrap it up. 
 We got to be out of here in 20 minutes. 
 All right. 
 [Door slides open, closes] 
 So, Doc, after I took off last night, what happened? 
 What do you think happened? I worked on my patients. 
 You know what I mean. 
 That cop Holden... he give you trouble? 
 He was pretty unhappy you disappeared. 
 He also made it very clear that he suspected I was involved. 
 And what did you tell him? 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing? 
 You sure about that? 
 You told the nurse about us. 
 Because I needed her help. 
 Listen... 
 Last night I did what you asked. 
 You threatened me, and I did it. 
 [Grunts] 
 You tell yourself that, if it makes it easier to go home to your wife and family in Buckhead. 
 But I know what it looks like when a man do a thing 'cause he threatened. 
 That ain't what happened. 
 That ain't you. 
 Have a good day, Doc. 
 Sorry. You rushed out of there so fast. 
 I just wanted to thank you. 
 I know you didn't ask to be in this situation, and I know none of this has been easy, and I... 
 Is that a... is that a patient chart? 
 Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it. 
 Sarita Cabrera? 
 Is this the Norteña girl who died? 
 [Sighs] 
 Why do you have this? 
 I said it... it's nothing. 
 Look, when she wasn't cursing me out, she kept talking about how her little brother wasn't safe. 
 So I'm just gonna make sure he's okay. 
 Gretchen... 
 There is a gang war in full swing out there. 
 Think about what we were just doing. 
 Do you realize how dangerous this could be? 
 Just call Social Services. 
 You think I didn't try that? 
 There's no record of the kid. 
 Three weeks of paperwork, and they might go and check on him. 
 It's not safe. 
 Yeah? Well... 
 You have your little projects, Doctor, and I have mine. 
 [Engine turning over] 
 [Car door closes] 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Morning, buddy. 
 You studying for that math test? 
 You want to run through these again? 
 No, thanks. I got it. 
 Samantha : Hey, you're home. 
 Finally. 
 Yeah, I'm sorry. 
 It was a marathon. 
 Hey, is, um... is Ollie okay? 
 He worries about you. 
 I should go. I need to get him to school. 
 Well, let me take him. It'll give us a chance to talk. 
 No, I asked your dad to come. 
 He's gonna meet the alarm-installation guys, and he's gonna pick up Ollie after school. 
 Sam, you didn't have to do that. 
 You, sir, are going to sleep. 
 Get some rest, okay? 
 [Cell phone vibrating] 
 [Cell phone beeps] 
 Hello? 
 Hey, Gretchen, can you talk? 
 Not really, Jed. 
 I'm looking for some apartment in northeast Atlanta. 
 It's like a freaking war zone up here. 
 Okay, well, I'll make it quick. I need to borrow some money. 
 Gretchen : Are you kidding? 
 I have zero dollars, none, Jed. 
 It's an emergency. 
 And don't forget, I got you those files to sell. 
 And I couldn't sell them because we were gonna get caught. 
 I know, but I was counting on that money, and now I've got the rent, and my cat has, like, these crystal things in his urine. 
 Jed, I cannot talk about this right now!

 Hello? 
 John, it's Bridget. 
 Look, I need to ask you about something. 
 Sure, is everything okay? 
 Last night I saw something that concerned me. 
 What... what was it? 
 You... coming out of the physical therapy room in the southwest hall and disposing of a hypodermic needle in a sharps bin. 
 Oh, that. 
 Uh... 
 Yeah, I felt a sore throat coming on, and I gave myself some bicillin just in case. 
 Bridget : John, you're really telling me... 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 You went to the pt wing during the busiest shift of the year to give yourself an antibiotic shot? 
 Yes, it was only for a minute. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 [Groans] 
 Bridget : John? 
 Yes, I'm sorry. I'm here. 
 [Knock at door] 
 Uh, Bridget, I need to go. 
 John... 
 I checked the sharps bin. 
 There... 
 Was a vial of morphine in there too. 
 How does that end up in the pt wing? 
 [Doorbell rings, knock at door] 
 Bridget, I'm so sorry, but I'm gonna need to, um... call you back. 
 John, do you have any idea how serious this is? 
 Bridget, I promise I will explain everything, but I got to go. 
 Bye. 
 [Line clicks, dial tone] 
 Good morning, Dr. Ellison. 
 You remember me from last night. 
 Is this a bad time? 
 I'd like you to come with me. 
 I'll try not to take up too much of your time. 
 These two were the first victims in last night's wave of violence. 
 Big man here died at the scene, CJ Thompson. 
 You said he arrived at the hospital DOA. 
 You okay? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Just... 
 Pretty gruesome, huh? 
 You said it. 
 I'm sorry, I don't... 
 What are we doing here exactly? 
 Well, I find it's always helpful to put things in context. 
 Gives us the big picture of it all, you know? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Okay, so... 
 When CJ came in, did you recognize him right away? 
 "Recognize him"? 
 No, I... 
 I never saw him before last night. 
 And these others that came in, did you ever meet any of them before last night? 
 No. 
 You making me wait? 
 I thought you was tight with us. 
 No. 
 No, never. 
 You're certain? 
 100%. 
 Listen, Detective, I am beat. 
 I got to get back home. 
 Well, as long as you're certain. 
 Sorry I couldn't be more helpful back there. 
 About that... 
 See, there's something still nagging at me here. 
 You said you never saw Curtis James before last night at the hospital, right? 
 Right. 
 Reason I ask is that a number of witnesses in the Antoine Tyler shooting said Curtis was at that scene... 
 With you. 
 Please! 
 Stop it! 
 He's dying, man! Help him! 
 Holden : Are you sure you didn't see him there? 
 Uh... 
 I mean, I'm sure you're right. I probably did. 
 I guess I just, um... 
 Never made the connection. 
 Um... 
 Wait. That was my turn. 
 Yeah. I thought we'd go down to the station for a little bit and chat some more, you know, just in case there's any other connections you... 
 Didn't make. 
 [Knock at door] 
 Hello, is anyone in there? 
 Hello, anyone home? 
 Hey, what's going on out here? 
 Sorry, I've been knocking on doors for practically an hour. 
 This is C-22, right? 
 Why? 
 I'm looking for the kid who lives there, Elio Cabrera. 
 Is that him? 
 Yeah, that's him. 
 What do you want with Elio? 
 I... 
 I work at Samaritan Hospital. 
 It's about his sister. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, we heard what happened. 
 The Locos sent some boys over to break the news. 
 They were gonna take him, but he was crying, and... 
 I said Elio could stay with my wife and me... 
 While I find his family. 
 So he has other family members? 
 Yeah, he's got an uncle in Arizona. 
 [Door opens] 
 Hi, Elio. 
 Hi. 
 Thanks for coming by. 
 It was real good of you. 
 Right, mi'jo? 
 Pobrecito. 
 I'll make you breakfast in a minute, hmm? 
 He's real broken up about his sis. 
 She was all he had. 
 Before I leave, I have to do an exam... 
 For the hospital paperwork. 
 You sure you have to? 
 He's been through a lot today. 
 Yeah, well, if I don't, someone else has to come by, so... 
 I'm already here. No sense in disturbing you twice. 
 Sure. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 My wife... she had a stroke. 
 This exam... 
 Anything special you're looking for? 
 Oh, you know, bruises, bites. It's just routine, really. 
 Oh. 
 Where'd you say the bathroom was? 
 In the hall on the right. 
 Mi'jo, this lady's gonna check you out, so you behave yourself, okay? 
 I need to ask you a few questions. 
 Is that all right? 
 [Whispering] If you don't talk to me, I can't help you. 
 Are you okay here? 
 I'm sorry about your sister. 
 I was with her. 
 And she cared about you so much. 
 Here, look... 
 She wanted you to have it. 
 She also told me she was worried that you're not safe. 
 Was it because of that guy out there? 
 She said to stay away from him. 
 Elio, he said you had an uncle in Arizona. 
 Is that true? 
 Oh, hi. Come on in. 
 The administration has lined up with the new commission, so it's gonna be a tug-of-war on affordable units. 
 Think it'll hold at 30%? 
 Well, I'm hoping to use the mixed-use tech zoning to get them to 20%, but it'll be a fight. 
 20%, that's a little optimistic. 
 Sorry, Connor. Uh, give me a moment? 
 [Cell phone beeps] 
 Hey, everything okay? 
 Well, I was gonna ask you the same thing. 
 What's going on with John? 
 What? What do you mean? 
 Well, I show up here at the house, and he's left this note saying he stepped out. 
 "Stepped out"? 
 He's supposed to be sleeping. 
 Well, that's what I thought. 
 But I got to talking to the cop out front, and he said that John left with a detective. 
 What do you mean? What... 
 Was he arrested? 
 No, it doesn't sound like that, but the cop didn't know that much. 
 I tried calling John, but he doesn't have his phone. 
 It's sitting here charging on the bedside table. 
 Sam... 
 Yeah, one sec. 
 [Sighs] 
 Gary, can you still pick up Oliver? 
 Well, sure. 
 Look, is there anything else that I can... 
 No, just let me know if you hear from John, okay? 
 Hey, we have to reschedule. 
 Something's come up. 
 You're serious? 
 Tell them I had a family emergency, okay? 
 I will call as soon as I can. 
 
 
 
 [Door opens] 
 Pardon the dungeon aesthetic. 
 We don't have a lot of private conference rooms. 
 Have a seat. 
 Uh... I don't... I don't feel comfortable about this. 
 Should I be calling a lawyer? 
 A lawyer? 
 Well, it's just, this is... 
 It's up to you, though in my experience, witnesses don't need lawyers. 
 Suspects do. 
 Which are you? 
 I'm just a guy that wants to go home. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm glad to hear that. 
 Let's just get it over with. 
 I thought we could talk about Antoine Tyler. 
 What about him? 
 Well, for starters, I was hoping you could tell me where he is. 
 I... assume he was discharged. 
 Yeah, so did I, at first. 
 But then I checked with the hospital, and... 
 Nothing. 
 Noth... what do you mean nothing? 
 No discharge, no transfer, just... 
 No Antoine. 
 All the hospital could say for sure was that he was no longer a patient at Samaritan. 
 Well, I... I wish I could help, but I really... I don't follow up on patients once they're admitted. 
 Only, in this case, you did, on the phone and in person, at least according to your colleagues. 
 Well, yes, yes. 
 But that was right after what happened. 
 So then sometime before Antoine disappeared, you just stopped? 
 Yeah, I was busy. 
 It's a damn shame. 
 You might have witnessed a miracle, 
 'cause either the good lord reached down and touched that boy and he walked out on his own two legs, or, more likely, someone took him. 
 Would you have any idea who that might have been? 
 Why would I? 
 Come on. 
 That boy disappears, and you're completely unaware? 
 I'm telling you, all I know here. 
 You keep saying that. 
 Really, I wish I could help. 
 You keep saying that too. 
 Why would I lie about this? 
 That's a very good question, Doctor. 
 And I got a theory. 
 So you sit tight for a minute. 
 I have some things I'd like to show you. 
 I... 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah, everything's fine. 
 He's just... he's got a rash. 
 So I want to get him checked out. 
 A rash? 
 I didn't see anything. 
 Probably just a contact allergy. 
 We'll sort it out at the hospital. 
 I'll take him down there. 
 No, really, it's... it's no problem. 
 Yeah, it is a problem. 
 The kid stays here. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Screams] 
 Run! 
 sh1t! 
 Elio! 
 [Engine turning over] 
 Put your seat belt on and lock the door. 
 Hurry. 
 Ah! 
 [Engine turning over] 
 sh1t. 
 I'm trying to reach my husband. 
 His name is John Ellison. He should be there. 
 Man : Computer says he's at the APD South Station at the Gang Unit. 
 Gang unit? Well, does it say why? 
 All I can say is that he arrived half an hour ago. 
 Well, I need to know what my husband is doing there. 
 I'm sorry, I can't give you that information over the phone. 
 [Line clicks] 
 Hello? Damn it. 
 [Door opens] 
 Thanks for waiting, Doctor. 
 Okay... 
 I've been a cop for a long time. 
 After a while, when a pattern starts to emerge, cops learn to trust their instincts. 
 It's got to be the same for doctors, right? 
 I suppose. 
 Sure, it is. 
 You see the symptoms, you figure out the disease. 
 Antoine Tyler, only son of Ezra Tyler, head of the vine city crew. 
 Scary guy, Ezra. 
 Still runs things from behind bars, as far as we know. 
 Why are you showing me these? 
 Just over a week ago, Ezra's only son is shot. 
 And you, a doctor who lives way up in Buckhead, just happened to be there to save that boy. 
 Come on, you read my statement. 
 I was going to the vet. 
 You just happened to stop in one of the most dangerous areas in Atlanta? 
 I was upset. 
 This man is a member of the Norteños Locos, the gang that shot Antoine. 
 But I'm guessing you already knew that, since, when he showed up in your er last week, you attacked him. 
 He was armed. 
 He brought a gun into a hospital. 
 A gun you didn't find until after the confrontation. 
 Isn't that right? 
 Yes, but still... 
 Hours later, you assaulted more men in the er waiting room, your third attack on Norteños members in as many days. 
 They were intimidating people. 
 Did they hurt anyone? 
 Did they even threaten anyone? 
 I was just looking out for my staff. 
 Who were you looking out for last night when a gang member in your care vanished out of the er when I was trying to question him, huh? 
 Darius Bishop... was seen leaving the hospital parking structure around 3:00 A.M. in hospital scrubs. 
 I was in the ER at that time. 
 Do you know who wasn't? 
 You. 
 Now, I'm no doctor, but if I had to diagnose your case, I'd say you're working for one of the most dangerous gangs in Atlanta. 
 There is some good news, Doctor. 
 There's a cure for people with your problem. 
 And here it is. 
 You want me to become an informant. 
 You tell me everything you know, we'll make a deal. 
 You'll be facing minimal jail time. 
 Might even be able to save your medical license. 
 How am I supposed to inform on people that I'm not even involved... 
 Eh, eh. Before you continue, let's talk about what's gonna happen if you don't play ball. 
 I go to the grand jury with all of this, and you get charged with assault, conspiracy, obstruction of justice, maybe even kidnapping. 
 And when you get out of jail in a decade or two, imagine what shape your life's gonna be in then. 
 I know what it looks like when a man do a thing 'cause he threatened. 
 That ain't you. 
 Holden : Do we have a deal? 
 I said, "do we have a deal"? 
 No. 
 N... 
 I don't think you understand. 
 Unless you have an explanation, you are... 
 Please, just... just listen to me. 
 I do have an explanation. 
 In the wake of my daughter's death... 
 I developed a substance-abuse issue. 
 Drugs. 
 This day in vine city, I didn't have anything on hand, so I went to buy in the street. 
 And the next day I came down hard. 
 I was agitated, and I snapped. 
 I attacked these men. 
 And last night during a... 
 Very, very hard shift, I stepped out... 
 And I self-medicated. 
 You know, I got to tell you, Doctor, this all seems rather convenient under the circumstances... 
 A drug problem that explains all of this. 
 Call Bridget O'Neill. 
 Bridget O'Neill? 
 She's a doctor at Samaritan. 
 Ask her what I was doing last night in the physical therapy wing at 3:00 A.M... 
 The time I was missing from the er. 
 [Touch tones beeping] 
 [Line trilling] 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 This is Dr. O'Neill. 
 Dr. O'Neill, this is Detective Robert Holden of the Atlanta Gang Task Force. 
 I need to ask you about a colleague of yours. 
 Colleague? Who? 
 John Ellison. 
 Are you aware or have any knowledge of his activities around 3:00 A.M. this morning? 
 His activities? 
 I don't really feel comfortable discussing his activities. 
 I'm sorry, what did you say this was for? 
 Ma'am, this is part of an ongoing investigation. 
 I just... 
 Last night was so busy, and... 
 I see. 
 Sorry to have bothered you, ma'am. 
 I appreciate you trying to remember. 
 Wait. I, uh... 
 [Sighs] 
 I... 
 Saw him coming out of a room in another department. 
 He was disposing of a syringe. 
 I see. 
 And was that unusual? 
 [Sighs] 
 Doctor, I need an answer, please. 
 I believe he was abusing morphine. 
 I see, ma'am. Sorry to trouble you. 
 Thank you. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Scoffs] 
 Gretchen : Get away from us. 
 Give him back. I'll take good care of him. 
 He is not getting out of this car. 
 Well, then you ain't going nowhere. 
 Back off, you freak, or I swear to god... 
 Yell all you want. 
 I'll stand here all day. 
 [Horn blaring] 
 That ain't gonna help. 
 These people know me. 
 If it comes down to it, who they gonna believe, huh? 
 Lady, just give me the kid. 
 You can go. 
 Put your seat belt on. 
 But we're... 
 Just put it on and hold on to the door. 
 [Engine turning over] 
 My truck! 
 What the hell? 
 Stop! 
 Crazy bitch! 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 [Gunshots] 
 You, out the car. 
 What the hell's going on here, making all this damn noise? 
 Alvarez, man, I'm so glad you're here. 
 You know how I'm taking care of Sarita's brother, right? 
 Yeah. 
 This lady just showed up asking to talk to him. 
 Next thing I know, she's walking out the door. 
 Yeah, 'cause he is... 
 Let him finish! 
 Then I tried to stop her, and she does this. 
 She says she's a nurse, but I think she's not right in the head. 
 You think I'm not right in... 
 Hey! Cállate! 
 Look what she did to my truck! 
 I'm just trying to help Elio, like I promised his sister. 
 Elio... 
 Ven aquí, mi'jo. 
 You know this lady? 
 No? 
 All right, now you talk. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Okay, look, I work at the hospital, okay? 
 Last night, before Sarita died, she told me she was worried about her brother, so I came to check on him. 
 This is how you check on kids... 
 By stealing them from the neighborhood? 
 I just want to find his family. 
 Shut the hell up, lady. This ain't your business, all right? 
 But you're not... 
 Hey! 
 I said shut up, all right? Don't test me, chica. 
 Go ahead. 
 Shoot me. 
 He is not staying here with that pervert. 
 What the hell you talking about? 
 Sarita told Elio to stay away from him. 
 Is that true, what she said? 
 See? 
 She's putting words in his mouth. 
 No, no. 
 Chacho... 
 Did Sarita really say that? 
 You made a big mistake coming here telling lies about people. 
 I'm not... you have to listen. 
 Alvarez : I don't have to do sh1t. Fito, take her inside. 
 Elio : Wait. 
 It's true what she said. 
 Is that right? 
 Come on. 
 You guys know me. This is crazy. 
 You're really gonna buy some dumb kid's story? 
 Hell, his puta sister was always in my face. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, "puta"? 
 You're gonna call my soldier a puta, after she died last night fighting for us? 
 No. 
 Alvarez... I didn't mean... 
 What you mean, then? 
 Please... 
 It's just... this crazy chick... 
 My truck... 
 Your truck. 
 Oh, your truck. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's go take a look. 
 Yeah, I see what you mean. 
 It's all smashed up, your hood, the bumper. 
 And plus, you got to fix this window. 
 Window? 
 What window? 
 That one. 
 [Spits] 
 We'll take care of that piece of sh1t. 
 You should go now. 
 We'll find Elio's family. 
 Standard protocol. It's just an interview. 
 I don't care if it's just an interview. 
 Tell the detective that interview is now over. 
 It's my understanding that Dr. Ellison didn't ask for a lawyer. 
 Well, his lawyer is asking for him. 
 I need you to have a seat. 
 As of 11:42 A.M., this interview became a violation of my client's constitutional rights. 
 Either charge him or bring him out... 
 Now, before this entire department spends the rest of the year digging itself out of the biggest legal shitstorm you've ever seen. 
 All right. 
 It seems your lawyer is here. 
 Apparently, she's also your wife. 
 In either case, I guess we got to wrap it up here. 
 Well... 
 It has been a pleasure. 
 I just want to say something before you go. 
 You say that you got a drug problem. 
 Thing is, I see a lot of drug users in my line of work. 
 And I got to be honest. 
 I look at you, and I just don't see it. 
 You have a son, a wife who clearly loves you. 
 You have a lot to lose. 
 Or maybe you're just scared. 
 Or maybe you're just someone whose loyalties have gotten... 
 Misplaced. 
 These people want to shoot each other up over street corners... 
 Let 'em. 
 You and me, we're on the same side. 
 [Chuckles] 
 "These people." 
 Who do you think takes care of "these people" when they shoot each other over corners? 
 I do... 
 Just like I do for cops and anyone else who walks into the er. 
 I'm just on the side that keeps everyone alive. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 I still don't understand. 
 Were they accusing you of something? 
 No, no, no, no. It was just a discussion. 
 A dis... 
 John, being in an interrogation room without a lawyer is more than a discussion. 
 Listen, I didn't want to worry you, but, um, last night a gang member disappeared from the er. 
 And it was just bad luck that it happened on my watch. 
 The police got upset, and when they found out I was involved in the Antoine Tyler shooting, they started jumping to conclusions. 
 John, this is... 
 No, but it's fine now. 
 I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, that's all. 
 Which is exactly when you call a lawyer. 
 Well, I would have, but, honestly, I think it would have made them more confident they were right. 
 You know? 
 Listen, bottom line, they had a theory based on a handful of facts. 
 I explained the situation, and they're satisfied. 
 And that's it? 
 It was a misunderstanding, and it's over. 
 [Pounds wall] 
 Gary : You all right there? 
 Oh, Jesus, Dad. 
 I'm sorry. I, uh... 
 I forgot you were here. 
 Huh. 
 What? I'm fine. 
 The kind of fine where you're sweating like it's 100 degrees? 
 It's been a long day. 
 John, I know what you're going through. 
 I've been there. 
 When we were in combat... 
 No, no. 
 No, that's different. 
 Is it? 
 You lost Becky, John. 
 You picked up a gun, and you shot a guy, for Christ's sake. 
 I know you're angry. 
 Dad... 
 I'm not angry. 
 I'm just... 
 Trying to control a world that won't be controlled, furious because you can't. 
 There's been something smoldering in you since the day that Becky got sick. 
 Look... 
 I put a lot of people that I love through hell trying to make that feeling stop. 
 Don't make that mistake. 
 Get some rest.

 Jed, if this is about your cat, I'm going to... 
 Jed : Bridget, I got a serious problem we got to talk about. 
 What? Are you all right? What happened? 
 I went down to medical records. 
 I know it was stupid, but I needed the money. 
 Anyway... 
 I was at a place I didn't belong. 
 There was a security guard there. 
 I didn't see him. 
 Jed, what the hell is going on? 
 I'm at county. 
 The cops... 
 They're asking a lot of questions. 
 What? 
 What questions? 
 About the hospital, about the stuff I did and the people I worked with. 
 Jed, listen to me. You cannot talk to them. 
 Do you understand? 
 Jed! Do you understand?
