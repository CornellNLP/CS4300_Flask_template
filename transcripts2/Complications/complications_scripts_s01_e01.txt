 The pilot is followed by episode 2: "Infection". 
 [Thunder crashing] 
 [Rain falling] 
 Man : Come on. 
 [Dog barking] 
 [Sighs] 
 Come on, Zeke. 
 Shh. Shh, shh, shh. 
 [Dog barking] 
 [Thunder crashing] 
 [Clattering] 
 [Dog barking] 
 Sam. Sam, wake up. 
 Wake up. Wake up. 
 Hey... 
 Shh. 
 Go to Oliver's room. Lock the door. 
 Don't make a noise and don't come out. 
 Why? 
 [Distant thud] 
 Someone's in the house. 
 Come on.

 I don't believe in violence. 
 I just want to say that before we get started here. 
 I mean, nobody's gonna say they believe in violence, nobody who's not a sociopath, I guess. 
 But you work in an ER for a while and see all the terrible things people do to each other, you learn to hate it. 
 And we're cleaning up this mess that starts out there. 
 We act like people die at the hospital. 
 Some do, of course, but for most of them, it was a... 
 There was a time, there was a last moment where they could have been saved. 
 [Inhales] 
 And that moment's long gone by the time they get here. 
 Um... 
 Dr. Elison? 
 Why don't you have a seat? 
 We should get things started. 
 So how does this work... exactly? 
 I mean, how do you go about... [Clears throat] 
 Evaluating someone's mental state? 
 Let's start with this. 
 Why do you think you're here? 
 Well, it's been a while since my psych rotation, but off the top of my head, I would say, um... 
 I had an inappropriate response to a clinical situation, possibly indicative of an affective disorder. 
 How was that? 
 Dr. Elison, I'm on your side. 
 My side? Oh, good. That's great. 
 It's good to know we're in this together. 
 All I'm saying is that I know you have been through a lot, and my job here is just to understand what happened. 
 Okay. Let's try this again. 
 Here's the thing, um, Dr. Laster. 
 You're the one who decides whether my career as a physician ends today. 
 So I can tell you what happened, but the why? 
 That's your call. 
 Doctor! 
 [Shouts indistinctly] 
 You can say I'm fine. 
 That I'm here because I used an iv stand for a nonstandard purpose. 
 Get out of my way! [Glass shatters] 
 You can say it was an isolated episode and I'm here because I had a hard night and I cracked under pressure. 
 Ahh! 
 [Shouting] 
 You can say I'm here because I'm batshit crazy. 
 [Overlapping shouting] 
 Let's go! 
 Get off of me! 
 On the ground! 
 Argh! 
 Stay there! 
 Guess you'll just have to take your pick.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Let's start with a little background. 
 Married? Family? 
 Yes. 
 My wife, Samantha, is a real estate lawyer. 
 We have a son, Oliver, who's ten. 
 [Wind chimes tinkling] 
 We, uh... 
 We had an eight-year-old daughter, Becky, but we lost her last year. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 [Laughter, chimes tinkling] 
 And how long have you been in emergency medicine? 
 Uh, ten years. 
 Listen, uh... 
 Could we... could we skip this? 
 I-I know my behavior today was completely unacceptable and I will make whatever apologies are necessary, but... 
 I need you to understand, I have patients who need me. 
 So I'm asking you, uh, as a colleague, if... 
 Dr. Elison, I appreciate your dedication to your work, but you're here as a patient, not as a colleague. 
 Tell me what happened on Sunday morning. 
 Of course. 
 [Sirens wailing in distance] 
 So while we're waiting on the labs, start her on the antibiotics and check her every 20 minutes. 
 Okay. And if her fever doesn't go down? 
 Come and get me. 
 If it spikes, run and get me. Got it? 
 That's why I wear my running shoes. 
 All right. 
 Yo, John. 
 Can I borrow you? 
 What's up? 
 I have a chest pain waiting, and sadly, we are bed-less. 
 Can... can five go to subacute? 
 Nope. She crashed. 
 We tubed her. She's waiting in ICU. 
 Okay, well, can nine go four and then four go hall? 
 Have you seen four? 
 Well, it says "minor laceration." 
 Yeah, and meth psychosis. 
 The guy tried to remove glass spiders under his skin with a screwdriver. 
 If we put him in the hall... 
 Then the spiders attack again? 
 Right. 
 Right. 
 Okay. Three's due for a ct. 
 How about three goes up, nine takes her place, three comes back, he goes to subacute eight... 
 It's full. I checked. 
 Yeah, but it's Henry Maxson. I'll give him some Insulin, and move him into the hall. 
 That, I believe, gets you your free bed. 
 [Laughs] Bam. My man. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. John Ellison is officially tonight's Samaritan hospital bed-Tetris champion. 
 Let's hear it. 
 Whoo! 
 Woman : Way to go, Doctor. 
 Thanks. Thank you. 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Hey, you finish up and get some sleep, okay? 
 Yup. 
 [Inhales sharply] Okay. 
 Gretchen? 
 Am I interrupting? 
 I'm pretty sure you know the answer to that question, Doctor. 
 Yeah, well, finish up. We got work to do. Bed eight. 
 Isn't there a smoke alarm in here? 
 Maintenance disabled it. I guess it kept going off. 
 Go figure. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Bed eight... that's Henry, right? 
 Yeah. How is he? 
 Well, I guess they didn't cure diabetes in the last couple days, 'cause he still has it. 
 How's that feel? 
 Any pain? 
 No, not really. 
 I haven't had any pain for the last few days. 
 [Chuckles] Is it getting better? 
 Remember we talked about this last time you came in? 
 The lack of pain is the problem. 
 The nerves are damaged. You been taking your Insulin? 
 I... I've been trying, but I ran out of what Dr. Dan gave me last time. 
 I know it's hard, Mr. Maxson, but you got to keep up with your Insulin shots. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah, I know. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 Henry, think it could be time to talk to a surgeon. 
 No. N... no, hey, Doc... 
 That medicine you gave me last time, that worked. 
 We... we could do that again. 
 Henry, the gabapentin was for the pain. 
 It doesn't make anything better. 
 There's got to be something that... you can do. 
 I... I promise, look, I will... I will follow the diet and the exercise, and I'm gonna do the Insulin every day just like you told me. 
 I'm not gonna do it halfway this time. 
 I'm gonna do it all the way. 
 There's got to be something you can do. 
 Doc, please, don't take my foot. 
 We'll try antibiotic therapy a little while longer, but I really... 
 No, thank you. 
 Thank you. Thank you so much, Doc. 
 Excuse us a moment. 
 So vanco one gram iv, okay? 
 Thanks, Gretchen. 
 Hey, so I'm moving Henry Maxson into the hall for an Insulin drip and IV vanco. 
 Can someone check on him in 30? 
 Another Insulin drip and antibiotics? 
 Why, exactly? 
 We're gonna take another run at saving that foot. 
 Rip off the band-aid, for god's sake. 
 That foot was toast weeks ago. 
 Why are we wasting resources on a noncompliant basket case? 
 So what, you want to dump him in the alley out back? 
 It's a thought. 
 I'll keep an eye on him. Go. 
 Thanks. 
 [Bird cawing] 
 [Child laughing] 
 Oh, oh, I think I found something, here, in your tummy. 
 I don't have anything in my tummy. 
 Trust me, I'm a doctor. 
 I think I found something, and I think it's... 
 It's an octopus. 
 No. I don't have an octopus. 
 I think you do, but hold still. 
 Maybe I can get it. 
 [Laughing] 
 [Dog barks] 
 John, if you rile up that dog, you're in trouble. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 I was just checking Oliver for octopuses. 
 All right. Come here. Come here. 
 Give me a hug. Oh. 
 Daddy, you're squishing me. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry. Hey, get this dog out of here. 
 Get out of here, Zeke. 
 [Sighs] 
 You okay? 
 Yep, I'm just, uh... 
 Long night. 
 I just... I need some food and some sleep. 
 Any chance we can get you off nights this year? 
 I spoke to Jay about it. 
 He said he'd see what he could do but with all the time I had to take off last year... 
 [Sighs] 
 I fell off the day schedule. 
 Yeah. 
 Here. Let me get that. 
 [Sighs] 
 Oof. 
 Ooh. 
 Tight. 
 Do you want me to relax you? 
 Mm. 
 It's been a while. 
 [Dog barking] 
 Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 [Barking continues] 
 Is that Zeke? 
 So what? Let him bark. 
 Oh, f... wait. Hold a minute. 
 [Barking continues] 
 Zeke. 
 Hey, Zeke. 
 [Growling] 
 Zeke! 
 Hey. What the hell? 
 [Barking] Zeke, off. 
 Off. 
 Hey. Leave it. 
 Leave it. 
 Is he alive? 
 He's not moving. 
 No, he's... he's asleep. 
 There's an animal rescue downtown I can take him to. 
 [Weakly] He'll make it, though, right? 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Normal voice] He'll... he'll be fine. 
 Hey, what's wrong? 
 Nothing. I'm sorry. 
 No, I just... 
 I was just remembering Becky chasing the squirrels in the back. 
 Me running after her, trying to keep her shoes tied... 
 [Sobs] 
 Hey. Hey. Hey. 
 Baby, just... just breathe. 
 It'll be okay. 
 I was doing so well. 
 And you're... you're still doing well. 
 God. 
 No, it's just, looking at that poor little thing there, dying. 
 He's not dying, Sam. 
 I'm gonna take him to the animal hospital. 
 I'll take him right now. 
 [Softly] Okay. 
 Hi. Is there a vet on duty? 
 I got a squirrel here. My dog got to it. 
 I'm bringing it in now. 
 I'm an M.D., and I gave him some midazolam. 
 Woman : How's his breathing? 
 Uh... 
 It's, um... 
 Actually, I... I won't be coming in. 
 [Phone beeps] 
 [Background chatter] 
 Ahh! 
 Ahh! 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Screaming] [Tires squeal] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Man : Help! 
 Somebody help! 
 Help! 
 Somebody help! 
 [Screaming] 
 Don't close your eyes, man. 
 Don't close your eyes, man. 
 Stop! 
 Please! 
 Stop it! 
 He's dying! That dude shot him! 
 You're pumping an artery. You're making it worse. 
 He's dying, man! Help him! 
 Call 911. 
 Tell them we need an ambulance. 
 Do it right now. 
 It hurts. 
 I know it hurts. 
 I know it hurts, but you're gonna be... 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 [Tires squeal] 
 Damn! 
 They're coming back, man! 
 They're coming back, man! 
 [Engine revving] 
 [Tires squealing] 
 [Coughs] 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Tires squeal] 
 [Sirens wailing in distance] 
 [Sirens bloop] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 You're a lucky man, Dr. Elison. 
 The guys who were after you, not so much. 
 We found their car in that parking lot right over there. 
 Shooter ran off, but the driver's dead. 
 How did he... what caused it? 
 Well, we're still determining that, but it appears to be multiple gunshot wounds to the torso. 
 A... and the... the victim? Is he... 
 He's on the way to the hospital. 
 Which one? Samaritan? 
 Does it matter? 
 I work there. 
 Yeah. You may get to spend some more time with him, then. 
 Now, one of the patrol officers found something in the passenger seat of your car... 
 The corpse of a small animal. 
 Can you tell me what that was doing there? 
 I... it was a squirrel. 
 My... my dog got to it. 
 Squirrel? 
 Yeah. 
 I was taking it to the vet on Edgewood and... 
 [Clears throat] 
 Well, it didn't make it. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Well, look, we're gonna take you in. 
 Write a full report. 
 Wait. Am I being arrested? 
 So long as everything lines up, you should be done in... a few hours. 
 All right. 
 Oh, by the way, there is just one other thing. 
 You said that the car was up by that lamppost there. 
 Right? 
 Yeah. Yeah. About there. 
 Okay, just... just bear with me for a second here, if you would, because you see, you fired three rounds at a moving car and you hit the driver center mass. 
 That's... I mean, that's incredible. 
 Got any explanation? 
 [Gunshots] 
 I just pulled the trigger. 
 Just pulled the trigger? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I told you you were a lucky man. 
 You should buy some lotto tickets. 
 Watch your head when you get in. 
 "Just pulled the trigger." 
 I should try that. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Man : They're coming back, man! 
 They're coming back, man! 
 [Car accelerating] 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Tires squealing] 
 [Metal crunches] 
 Everything all right? 
 Never better. 
 You know, I read the police report earlier. 
 What you did was very brave. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I imagine it was also quite traumatic. 
 Traumatic enough to explain what happened today in the er? 
 [Chuckles] Let's not worry about that for the moment. 
 Just tell me if you remember your feelings at the time. 
 I... I wasn't really thinking about my feelings. 
 No? 
 I'm surprised. 
 Between the incident with the squirrel, the loss of your daughter, your wife's reaction... 
 Obviously, I... I had a lot on my mind, but, uh... I was focused on the boy lying on the ground bleeding to death, and I remember thinking that he probably only had a partial arterial transection and I could save him if I could get pressure on it. 
 And the young man you shot? 
 [Scoffs] 
 What were your feelings about him? 
 [Sighs heavily] 
 Angry. 
 Angry he put me in the position where I had to do that. 
 How am I supposed to feel in that situation? 
 Guilty? 
 Uh, sad? What? 
 This isn't a test. 
 But it is a test. 
 You're evaluating me. 
 What if I had no reaction? 
 I felt absolutely nothing after killing a 19-year-old kid? 
 Clearly unhealthy. 
 And at the other end of the spectrum, say I was completely overwhelmed and stopped functioning. 
 Unhealthy. 
 But between the two, there's the perfect mix of pain and dissociation. 
 It's just right. 
 So... where's that? 
 I'm afraid I can't answer that. 
 Why not? 
 I can give my patients an optimal O2 sat number or blood pressure range. 
 Dr. Elison, I don't know how else to put this. 
 I need to know how you process this trauma. 
 Do you know what happens after you shoot someone? 
 Like, what happens next, specifically? 
 Spend about six hours in a police station. 
 And it's not a therapeutic environment where you process your trauma. 
 [Sighs] 
 You all right there, Doc? 
 We're almost done here. 
 Yeah. 
 I, uh, I work late. 
 I haven't slept much. 
 How about a cup of our fine police station coffee? 
 No, I'm okay. Thanks. 
 All right. I don't blame you. 
 You know... [sighs] 
 These binders you've been looking at, these fellas right here are members of Norteños Locos... 
 Northern Atlanta-based, mostly Mexicans, central Americans. 
 These guys, they're part of an outfit called Vine City Crew. 
 They hang out in the area we picked you up at. 
 And these two binders are fighting each other these days. 
 So let me ask you a question. 
 Do you recognize any one of these guys? 
 No. 
 You're sure? 
 Well, there was a glare on the windshield and most of the people in the park were running away. 
 All right, well, it was worth a try. 
 And I guess that will finish us up. 
 Your wife's waiting for you in reception. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, Dr. Elison, just one more thing. 
 So far, this thing hasn't gotten any play with our friends in the press, which is good, because that just makes our job that much harder. 
 You plan on talking to reporters? 
 Oh, no. No, I'm... why would I... 
 Well, you know, situations like this, reporters tend to get a little crazy and suddenly, everyone decides that there's a hero in our midst and, well, sometimes, someone decides he wants to be that hero. 
 That's not you, is it? 
 No. 
 No. 
 No. That's not me. 
 Well, good. 
 You have a nice day. 
 John. 
 God. 
 It's all right. 
 I'm okay. 
 Samantha : Is there anything else in the file, or... 
 Okay. Yeah. Oh, no. Thank you so much. 
 Yeah. Okay. Talk to you tomorrow. 
 [Phone beeps] [Sighs] 
 Who was that? 
 A friend in the D.A.'s office. 
 And? 
 Told me what he could. 
 The boy, the one you saved, he's the son of a prisoner in the federal system. 
 His name is Antoine Tyler. 
 I also found out about the boy who... 
 Was shot too. 
 His name was Raul Mendoza. 
 Police files have him listed as a known gang associate. 
 How are you doing? 
 I think I'm okay. 
 John, you don't have to be okay. 
 Sam, I know what happened today was... awful, but... 
 I can't explain it, exactly, but I feel different, like I can breathe. 
 And for the first time in a very long time, I want to go to work. 
 Samantha : John, you ready? 
 Ollie's gonna be late for school. 
 Be right there. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 This is Dr. Harper. 
 Hey, it's John. 
 Hey, Johnny, listen, I heard what happened. 
 Now, how are you doing? 
 [Sighs] Yeah, no, I'm fine. 
 Hey, I just wanted to check in on the boy who came in yesterday. 
 You... you worked on him, right? 
 Quentin : Yeah. 
 Yeah, and he's good, as far as I know. 
 I mean, I didn't have him here too long. 
 Got him stable and I sent him up to surgery. 
 He was all right, though? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I was worried for a little bit, but we got him through. 
 [Sighs] Great. 
 Okay. That's... that's great. Thanks. 
 Yeah. You're welcome. 
 See you soon. 
 You okay back there? 
 You want some music? 
 No, thanks. 
 Why are you driving me to school? 
 Usually Mom drives me. 
 Well, I thought I'd drive you today. 
 Because of the thing that happened? 
 Ollie, what do you know about the thing that happened? 
 You got any questions you want to ask me? 
 No. I understand. 
 What do you understand? 
 You told me when I got my shots. 
 When you're a doctor, to help someone, sometimes you have to do something that hurts. 
 [School bell rings] 
 All right. 
 Hey, I love you. 
 Yep. I love you too. 
 [Buzzer] 
 Man : Can I help you? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 I wanted to use the gun range. 
 You just select your weapon. 
 We have our rentals over here. 
 We got semiautomatics on top. 
 Revolvers lower. 
 Hmm. 
 Um... 
 That one. 
 It's a Beretta model 92. 
 Are you familiar with the weapon? 
 [Gunshots] 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Gun clicks]

 [Phone buzzing] 
 Hi. 
 Samantha : Hey, it's me. Where are you? 
 I... uh... I'm out running errands. 
 [Sighs] John, your father called. 
 He's coming over. 
 All right. Um... 
 I'll be... fine. I'll be home in a few minutes. 
 Bye. 
 [Phone beeps] 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Thanks for coming over. 
 You don't have to pretend to be happy to see me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm your father. 
 I get to worry about you whether you want me to or not. 
 Yeah. Guess that's fair. 
 How you holding up? 
 Okay. 
 Going back to work? 
 Yep. Tomorrow night. 
 Sam doesn't want me to, but I got a patient... 
 Uh, patients I need to follow up with, so... 
 Talk to a lawyer? 
 Police seem satisfied. 
 Yeah, well, that can all change. 
 People who weren't there second-guessing you. 
 Happened all the time in 'Nam. 
 Actually, uh... 
 I got a... I got a question about that. 
 Were you... [sighs] 
 Good at it? 
 Was I good at what? 
 Was I good at Vietnam? 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 Were you good at... 
 War? 
 Yeah. I guess I was. 
 When I got there, I did what I had to do. 
 That's pretty much the bar for being a good soldier. 
 And did you, uh... 
 Did it bother you? After? 
 In my first firefight, I got stuck behind this dead tree thing, and I'm just staying down, trying not to crap in my pants, and I hear this sound. 
 I think it's a lieutenant coming to tell us to fall back. 
 It's two NVA coming out of the jungle 30 feet away. 
 I shot them both before I could even think about it. 
 You never told me that. 
 I never much liked thinking about it. 
 When did you stop? 
 Thinking about it, I mean. 
 Next firefight. 
 Give it time. 
 Here. 
 I want you to have this. 
 Put that away. I don't... I don't want that. 
 John, you got your wife and my grandson to protect. 
 This is ridiculous. I... I don't want it. 
 Put it away... 
 Damn it. Listen to me. 
 Take it. 
 Take it and put it someplace safe. 
 Someplace where you can get to it if you need it. 
 Take it. 
 They're coming back, man! They're coming back, man!

 This... this is not necessary. 
 What do you mean? We got a hero in our midst. 
 The nursing staff made you a cake. 
 Show him, Sherry. 
 Wow! 
 That's, uh... 
 Seriously, everyone, uh, thank you. 
 The cake's amazing. 
 Sherry : All right, back to work, everybody, before people start dying on us. 
 And don't take your cake into a patient care area unless you want drug-resistant staph in your frosting. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Farkas : Bullet behaved pretty well for a bullet. 
 Aside from the partial transection of the carotid, there was a pseudoaneurysm on the internal jugular. 
 How was the lung? 
 He was aspirating pretty badly by the time the ambulance got there. 
 Farkas : Minimal damage to the trachea. 
 Mild trauma to the right apical segment. 
 I excised a chunk of the superior lobe. 
 Bullet came within a centimeter of the aorta, though, so I figured it was a small price to pay. 
 How much blood did he lose? 
 How many units did he need? 
 At least six during surgery. 
 If you're asking whether what you did at the scene saved the kid, John, yeah, it did. 
 I should run. 
 I'll add you to the patient update list, okay? 
 Yeah. Thanks.

 Sounds straightforward. 
 Does it? 
 What? 
 You'll see. 
 Okay. 
 Tell me again what happened. 
 Woman : I was in the backyard and... 
 She fell off the porch. 
 I pressure washed it this morning, and it was still slick this afternoon. 
 Let's... let's let her answer please. 
 Okay. So the, uh... 
 The bruises, that's where they came from too? 
 Y... yeah. 
 John : And you're sure you only fell once? 
 'Cause, you know, you got bruises on both sides of your body. 
 It's kind of unusual to see that from a single fall. 
 Okay. She told you what happened. 
 Yeah, and I'm just confirming what she said, sir. 
 Please. 
 So just one more thing to take care of. 
 We're gonna need a pelvic exam. 
 Wait, what? 
 Why? 
 Yeah, we just need to check. 
 In rare cases, a fall can cause reproductive harm. 
 So you can go to the waiting room. 
 John : Yeah.

 John : You don't need to get undressed, Hillary. 
 I just needed a moment alone to ask you a few questions. 
 If someone's hurting you, I want you to be able to talk about it freely and confidentially. 
 I slipped off the porch, like he said. 
 [Scoffs] 
 You slipped? 
 You got a problem? 
 No. I... 
 Forget it. 
 Sorry. Can we go back to the... 
 No, I want to hear what she has to say. 
 What? 
 He's gonna kill you, eventually. 
 You know that, right? 
 Gretchen. 
 How is this your business, bitch? 
 If you expect us to put you back together after he busts you up, I'd say it makes it our business! 
 Let's talk outside. Excuse us, please. 
 Hey. What was that? 
 Look at her charts. 
 She's been in here six times in a year... 
 Concussion, broken nose, ruptured spleen. 
 She is gonna die, and we're just watching it happen. 
 Believe me, I want to help her. 
 The guy's a son of a bitch, no question, but there are procedures for dealing... 
 Yeah? Like what? 
 I got a procedure. 
 You still have that gun from the other day. 
 Excuse me? 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 Nothing. 
 Are you proposing I... I shoot the man? 
 Why, are you offering? 
 No, I am not offering. 
 Then I guess I was joking. 
 Just take her up to ct. 
 So what was that about? 
 Nothing. 
 Oh, come on. Spill it. 
 Are we having another Gretchen incident? 
 Nothing. 
 You know they've been trying to fire her for over a year. 
 Don't feel you have to cover for her. 
 I said it's fine. 
 Didn't look fine. 
 Well, it was. 
 If you say so. 
 Hey, John, would you check me on something here? 
 What? 
 I got a kid in earlier, said he was in a fight. 
 Does this look like a coup and contrecoup to you? 
 John : Could be. 
 It's hard to tell if that's blood or artifact. 
 What happened? He get hit by a board maybe? 
 Or a bat? 
 He just said it was a fight. 
 He's not a talker. 
 I can't even get him to take his clothes off for a full examination. 
 He's a mean little sucker. 
 Won't take off his clothes? Why? 
 I don't know, probably just a bad case of recent criminal activity syndrome. 
 I'll tell you one thing: This didn't happen today. 
 I mean, judging from the tissue damage, the break is at least a day old. 
 A day old? 
 Yeah. Maybe two. 
 Where is he? 
 That's him. 
 [Voice distorted] Came in with a couple guys who said they found... 
 Triage nurse said... 
 Either way, he's gonna need a surgical consult. 
 So we... John! 
 John. 
 Good evening, Mr. Rodriguez. 
 'Sup? 
 I hear you won't take off your clothes for the examination. 
 My colleague here just showed me your... your scans, and, uh, you're in bad shape. 
 Without a full exam, we're... 
 I got hurt on my face. 
 You can see that with my clothes on. 
 John, seriously... 
 Hold on. 
 I'll tell you what, how about this? 
 You tell us exactly how you hurt yourself, and then we'll see about the clothes. 
 Thought he was my doctor. 
 We both are. 
 So how did you hurt your face? 
 I don't got to talk to you, Doc. 
 Dan : I'm not sure this is... 
 Mr. Rodriguez, I'm concerned that the head injury may be causing confusion, and if that's the case, I'm gonna have to compel treatment. 
 Yo, what are you talking about? 
 I'm saying do as I ask, or I'm gonna make you do as I ask. 
 Nah. Not gonna happen. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Hey, just hang on. 
 Get off! Get off! 
 Hey! 
 [Grunting] 
 Knife! 
 Ah! 
 [Grunting] 
 Get off me! 
 Help me get his arm free. 
 [Grunting] 
 Get it. 
 I can't get his arm free. 
 Give it to me. Give it to me. 
 [Grunts] 
 Dan : You okay? 
 I'm all right. 
 Did nobody think to search this guy when he came in? 
 [Softly] I don't know. 
 Hey. 
 Was this for my patient? 
 Was this for Antoine Tyler? 
 You came into this hospital to kill my patient? 
 Is that what this is? 
 Answer me! 
 [Gun clicks] John! 
 Just cool off. 
 Laster : Dr. Elison. 
 Dr. Elison. 
 Is it fair to say at this point that your medical judgment was clouded? 
 No. 
 No, I wouldn't say that it was. 
 You had a confrontation with a patient that wasn't yours. 
 On behalf of a patient who was. 
 We're talking about a medical judgment, Dr. Elison. 
 Let me ask you something. 
 When I shot Raul Mendoza, was that a medical decision? 
 I'd have to say no. 
 Kept my patient alive. 
 You killed someone. 
 All right, so what if I'd run away and left Antoine Tyler to die? 
 Would that have been a medical decision? 
 Result's the same. One kid dies. One kid lives. 
 The only difference is, it's my patient that dies. 
 Is that a better outcome? 
 Firing a gun is not a medical decision. 
 Okay. So the gun's the issue. 
 So what if I stayed in the street and focused on tamponading the boy's carotid? 
 Medical decision? 
 Yes. I'd say it is. 
 In which case I would have died along with my patient. 
 Two deaths instead of one in either of the previous scenarios. 
 Wouldn't call that a real victory for medicine, would you? 
 Touché, Dr. Elison. 
 Let's get back to Antoine Tyler, since he seems to be in the middle of all of this. 
 Dr. Laster, I think it's better for all concerned if we just leave him out of this. 
 Well, unfortunately, I can't do that. 
 There are patient confidentiality issues. 
 As there are with any kind of evaluation. 
 Now please, Doctor. 
 All right. 
 If you insist. 
 I'm saying I believe this patient was involved with Sunday's shooting of Antoine Tyler, yes. 
 Dacy : And why do you think that, exactly? 
 He came in with bilateral orbital fractures, frontal skull fracture, and ethmoid sinus fracture. 
 All the injuries from a single, forceful blow. 
 And that means? 
 Usually, an MVA. A face full of dashboard. 
 He was probably the passenger in the car, the one pulling the trigger. 
 You know, when we interviewed you, you said you couldn't see the passenger. 
 I couldn't. 
 Look, all I know is, he knew me, he was armed, and he seemed very intent on staying that way. 
 I guess I can get a forensics unit there in the morning. 
 We'll check him against what we found in the car. 
 Tomorrow morning? 
 Doc, we've had a very busy night. 
 If I have to ask you any more questions, I'll give you a call. 
 You be careful, okay? 
 Yeah. 
 How's that feel? 
 It's fine. Thanks. 
 Hey, man, we need to talk. 
 Want to tell me what the hell that was back there? 
 I'm sorry. I just... 
 I went in to talk to the guy, and things got out of hand. 
 Now, look, I understand you're under a lot of pressure, John, but, Jesus, that was my patient there. 
 You're talking about compelling treatment? 
 You had no grounds for that. What if he complained? 
 I think if you bring a gun into a hospital, you lose your right to complain. 
 All right, just go home, and then we'll talk about this later. 
 I'm not going home. I can't. 
 Uh, yeah, actually, you can. 
 That's what people do when they get stabbed at work. 
 I didn't get stabbed. I got cut. 
 Okay. My mistake. 
 Except here's the thing: You know what people do when they get cut at work? 
 They go home. 
 I said I'm not going home, Dan! 
 Hey, listen, maybe it's not my place to tell you this, but I think you're taking this whole thing a little personally, John. 
 For a sec, I was actually worried you were gonna shoot that guy. 
 Dr. Elison, we got a situation in the waiting room. 
 Hey. What's going on? 
 Those guys out there, they came in with Dr. Sherman's patient, the guy who cut your arm. 
 What are they doing? 
 They keep trying to come in. 
 They're not just in emergency, either. 
 Security stopped a couple of them in the east wing. 
 They found a guy in pediatrics. 
 Okay. Did we talk to the police? 
 Yeah, I guess there's some kind of big thing going on across town. 
 What? What? 
 Some kind of shooting. 
 They said they could get to us when they can get to us. 
 What about security? 
 I told Lewis and the others to lock the front area down, but they ain't the cops. 
 We can try to declare an internal emergency, send everybody we can along to Grady, but at this hour... 
 Do it. 
 Doctor, I'm supposed to call administration... 
 They got a problem, they can talk to me. 
 Just do it. 
 Tell me if anything changes. 
 Okay. 
 John, everything all right out there? 
 I think so. For now anyway. 
 How's the arm? 
 Well, I'm not gonna bleed to death anytime soon. 
 [Chuckles] Good. 
 Listen, I wanted to talk to you about a patient. 
 Okay. Who? 
 Henry. 
 Your pet diabetic with the dry-gangrenous left foot. 
 He's back in already? 
 Yep, he came in about an hour ago while you were in with knife guy. 
 He's in bad shape. 
 He tore open the foot. 
 Some kind of work accident, although, how he was even standing on it, I have no idea. 
 Yeah, he's got some kind of warehouse job. 
 Well, in any case, the cellulitis is now nec fasc. 
 He's septic and in DKA. 
 It has to come off now. 
 I, uh... 
 Need you to talk to him. 
 What is it? 
 He didn't take the news well. 
 Dr. Armstrong is in surgery for the next six hours, so I set up a transfer to the Ansley Surgical Center. 
 They're prepping the or now. 
 He says he doesn't want to go. I said he had to. 
 Kind of left it there. 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Henry. 
 Henry? 
 Hey. 
 Code blue. Code blue! 
 I need a nurse in here! Nurse! 
 Woman over pa : Code blue, ER. 
 Code blue, ER, stat. 
 Get the code cart. I need Dr. O'Neill in here now. 
 Dr. O'Neill! 
 Get him atropine. 
 When was the last time you were in here? 
 15 minutes. Maybe 20. 
 Did you give him any medications? 
 Nothing. He just wanted some water. 
 Sherry. Sherry. There. 
 Check those. See what he took. 
 Digoxin, metoprolol, ativan, lisinopril, Norco. 
 Whoa, oh. What happened? 
 Your patient OD'd on bed 15's meds is what happened. 
 He was fine! I looked in on him. 
 You told a guy you were cutting off his foot, and you left him alone. 
 Ventilator. Let's go. 
 Pacers, please. 
 Get a second large bore iv in his ac. 
 Tell pharmacy to get some Digibind and hang some dopamine. 
 Pacers, please. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 Ready. 
 Start pacing him. 
 [Machine whirs on] 
 We getting anything? 
 It looks like a block. You give him the atropine? 
 Yes. 1 amp. 
 The pacer's not capturing. 
 Narcan, calcium, and glucagon... Still nothing. 
 Nothing. 
 [Machines beeping] 
 Initiate CPR. 
 Come on. 
 [Sharp breaths] 
 Hold CPR. Check for rhythm. 
 Bridget : Come on! 
 [Machines beeping] 
 [Sighs] 
 John, I... 
 For what it's worth, I was aware he was upset. 
 That's why I talked to you... 
 It wasn't your fault. 
 He did what he did. 
 Did he have any family? 
 No. 
 He used to talk about that when he was in here. 
 The paperwork, do you want me to... 
 I called the code. I'll do it. 
 [Bridget sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Clears throat] 
 Henry Maxson, 28-year-old diabetic male. 
 I discovered the patient unresponsive and cyanotic. 
 I initiated CPR and dosed... 
 [Softly] Dosed atropine, one milligram iv. 
 Doctor. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, is something... 
 [Clears throat] 
 Yeah, just, uh, give me a minute, please. 
 Um, uh, the thing is, there's a phone call for you. 
 Who is it? 
 He won't say, but it sounds important. 
 But I think you should take it. 
 Hello? 
 Man : Is this Dr. Elison? 
 Yes. 
 W... who am I speaking with? 
 I... I said, who am I... 
 Man : The boy you saved... 
 I'm his daddy. 
 John : Um... what can I do for you? 
 Tonight, a Mexican dude came up into the hospital. 
 He cut you. 
 Yes. 
 H... how did you... 
 You know why he was there? 
 I think he was there to kill your... your son. 
 That's right. 
 The others, the ones outside, they're gonna be coming in to do what he didn't do. 
 He's safe here. There's security. 
 Man : No. You listen to me, Doctor. 
 That ain't gonna stop these men. 
 They got a job to do, and they mean to do it. 
 They're gonna be up in that hospital tonight. 
 W... what... what do you... What do you want from me? 
 What you think I want? 
 I want you to save him. 
 Antoine dies tonight, we gonna have a problem. 
 I'll try. 
 You do that, Doctor. 
 You do that. 
 I got to go. 
 Wait. I... 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 Nurse. Nurse. 
 Gretchen! 
 Remember the patient from earlier, the one with the... The fractured clavicle? 
 Yeah, you mean the one who slipped? 
 Yeah, I remember that one. 
 Is she still here? 
 Yeah, she's up in Radiology. 
 I got the... Gretchen. 
 I got the sense that she meant something to you. 
 What if we could help her? 
 If her blood work came back positive for signs of meningitis, we could get her into isolation, away from the boyfriend, get a social worker in there, maybe save her life. 
 Why would her blood work come back positive for meningitis? 
 Because her doctor said it did. 
 Interesting. Why would her doctor do this? 
 I need your help. 
 I need to get Antoine Tyler out of this hospital now. 
 It needs to happen without anybody knowing. 
 Okay, well, he's a sick kid. 
 Where do you propose to put him? 
 Henry Maxson was scheduled to go to Ansley Surgical Center, but the hospital doesn't know that. 
 I ran the code, called it, but it's not in the computers yet. 
 If we switch Antoine's records with Henry's, you can get him down to transport. 
 They can get him over to Ansley under Henry's name. 
 And when he lands at Ansley? 
 Well, they'll discover that he's not a 28-year-old diabetic. 
 He'll become a John Doe with a gunshot wound, and... and he's not in the system. 
 Until Ansley cross-references the records and puts it together five minutes later. 
 And besides, I can't just wheel him out in front of security. 
 Gretchen, the boy is going to die tonight if I don't do something. 
 There has to be a way. 
 I didn't say there wasn't a way. 
 I said your way won't work. 
 Hey, it's Dr. Elison. 
 I got some lab results back on patient farmer. 
 She came in with a fractured clavicle, but we found some nuchal rigidity, and along with her headaches, it looks like meningitis. 
 Man : Seriously? Viral? 
 Probably bacterial. 
 So let's do an LP and call Infectious Diseases about, you know, getting her admitted ASAP. 
 The lab results are in the computer. 
 Man : All right. I'll get on it right away. 
 Thanks.

 Remember, it's locked down. 
 Let me through! 
 I can't let you do that. 
 Come on, man! 
 I can't let you do it! 
 Doctor, just calm down. Okay? 
 You don't want to go out there. 
 Get out of my way! 
 Get out, all of you. 
 I know why you're here. 
 You want to hurt somebody? 
 Hurt me. 
 Better watch how you talk. 
 Might just get what you ask for. 
 Ahh! 
 All units to ER waiting room! 
 I repeat, all units to ER waiting room! 
 Copy that. 
 Man : Kick his ass!

 Argh! 
 Henry Maxson going to Ansley Surgical Center. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Scanner beeps] 
 Man : All right, let's move him. 
 [Shouting] 
 This ain't over! 
 Let me go. It was... 
 Dr. Elison, you got to calm down. 
 You should be out there dealing with them. 
 Stop it now, or we have to cuff you. 
 You understand? 
 All right. All right. 
 I'm done. 
 I'm done. 
 Let's go. 
 So Antoine Tyler... 
 Did not disappear into thin air. 
 No. 
 And your breakdown... 
 Was either less severe than you thought or a lot more severe. 
 Let me know if you figure that out. 
 You realize I have to report this. 
 Do you know what that will mean? 
 Do you? 
 I know that that is not what you wanted to hear, but your mental state is out of... 
 This is not about me. 
 This is about you understanding what your decision today means for patient Tyler, currently recovering at Ansley Surgical Center. 
 That is not relevant to this evaluation... 
 It is all that is relevant. 
 He is a patient in my care. 
 This is criminal behavior, Dr. Elison, and under the circumstances, I cannot recommend that you return to work, much less see patients. 
 I'm sorry if that is not an acceptable outcome for you, but... 
 Let me finish! 
 You took an oath to do no harm, just like I did, Doctor. 
 So let's... let's talk about harm. 
 If you report everything you've heard today, this is what's going to happen: I will lose my job, and I will be unable to protect Antoine Tyler, and the men looking for him will find him, and they will kill him. 
 Is that an acceptable outcome? 
 No. 
 I think that's all we have to talk about then. 
 Dr. Elison? 
 I just want to say one thing before you go. 
 In my practice, I counsel a lot of doctors on the risks they have to take to help people. 
 I have to tell them to accept that some measure of playing god is necessary to do the job. 
 But there's a reason we confine that to the practice of medicine. 
 It protects them, and it protects you. 
 You take that outside the hospital, and there will be complications. 
 [Door closes] Good luck.
