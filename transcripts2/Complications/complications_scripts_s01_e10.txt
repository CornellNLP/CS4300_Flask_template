 John : Previously on Complications... 
 Easy, on phone : That boy you saved, I'm his daddy. 
 My son's your responsibility until I say he isn't. 
 John : I found a place to move Antoine. 
 Who is this kid? 
 Just a patient that needs special attention. 
 What did you get me into? 
 An easy 25 grand. 
 There were people in our house. 
 What if they were here to hurt us? 
 It'll be all right. 
 There's been a gang shooting. 
 Holden : We got a missing patient. 
 Darius Bishop seems to have vanished out of his room. 
 I need to find out where he is, and I need to know now. 
 This man here is suspected of murdering a 17-year-old boy. 
 If you could just talk to John. 
 My answer is no! 
 John : I'm caught in the middle, between two gangs. 
 You stop taking care of 'Toine, I'll kill you. 
 You made a mistake coming down here, Doc. 
 [engine revving] 
 [horn blaring] 
 I can't run. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 John : There's someone I need to talk to. 
 When I go to the police, I can leave you out of this, but the price of my silence is peace. 
 You end the war with the Locos. 
 Do you remember Kyle Hawkins? 
 We were just friends, and then we crossed the line, and... 
 Just get out of my sight!

 Morning. 
 You sleep okay? 
 Not really. 
 Can we discuss this? 
 Please. 
 What do you want me to say? 
 I almost died yesterday. 
 I'm breaking my ass trying to find a way to save this patient and protect this family. 
 And I come back last night to find out that my father almost shot your boyfriend. 
 Kyle isn't... he was never my boyfriend. 
 Really? 'Cause it seems to me when this family was in danger, you went to him. 
 Because we needed help. 
 [scoffs] 
 You weren't telling me anything. 
 You were off living this secret life. 
 It wasn't a secret life in someone else's bed No, but it was the one that put our family in danger in the first place! 
 John, what I did was wrong, and I... 
 I will regret it for the rest of my life... but I was grieving alone. 
 You... 
 You just went back to work. 
 It was like nothing touched you. 
 I have never stopped grieving for our daughter. 
 Never. 
 I know. 
 But I didn't know how deep that went until... all of this. I... 
 We've been through so much... so much. 
 There has to be a way that we can get through this. 
 Please, John. 
 I can't talk about this right now. 
 [crying] 
 [sighs] 
 How you holding up? 
 I'm all right. 
 Didn't sound all right from what I heard. 
 I went to the tow yard this morning. 
 I got your stuff that was in the wreck. 
 Some of it got pretty banged up. 
 Thanks. I, uh... 
 Yeah, it's just clothes and things. 
 Well, it's not just clothes. 
 You shouldn't leave this lying around. 
 It's still there. 
 You've got a lot of enemies out there right now. 
 John, a little advice from someone who's been there... 
 You don't put down your weapon until the shooting stops. 
 Gretchen : You want me to talk to the police? 
 Is that... Are you trying to be funny? 
 I could not be more serious. 
 You're the one that blackmailed the gang, not me. 
 [sighs] Listen... 
 I'm trying to make a deal for protection, hopefully for immunity. 
 I think you should come with me. 
 John, you're the hero doctor. 
 The cops came to you, not me. 
 They don't even know that I'm involved. 
 I can talk to them, all right? 
 I can tell them... 
 Talk to the about what? 
 I don't have information on these gangs. 
 Okay, think about it... 
 I go to the cops and I don't get a deal, then what happens? 
 I'm dead. 
 I'll go to the surgery center today and see about getting Antoine home. 
 So, when you talk to the cops, I expect you to say nothing about that place. 
 You don't say the name "Gretchen." 
 You don't use the word "nurse." 
 You just forget that I exist. 
 All right, if that's what you want. 
 Believe me, that's what I want. 
 Just so you know, if Gretch gets hurt, I'm coming after you. 
 Ingrid, please. 
 No! 
 You had your talk with this guy. This is mine. 
 Seriously, Doctor, I'll mess you up. 
 She's the responsible sister. 
 I don't give a sh1t. 
 You want some toast? 
 No. 
 Okay.

 [indistinct chatter] 
 Holden : There you are. 
 I was beginning to wonder if you were gonna stand us up. 
 I had a few things to take care of. 
 Well, here we are. 
 You made the right decision coming to us. 
 I'm sorry, who are you? 
 This is my partner, Detective Hawthorne. 
 I've been working closely with him on the case. 
 I will be helping out with the details of witness protection. 
 So let's talk about what you know, Doctor. 
 We can start... 
 Nuh-uh, no. 
 No, that's... that's not how this is gonna work. 
 Beg your pardon? 
 I'll be discussing the specifics with the District Attorney. 
 I don't know if you're aware, but you really can't afford to wait. 
 We've been hearing a lot of talk about you on the streets. 
 You got some enemies. 
 Yeah, I realize that, which is why I'm only gonna talk when there's an offer of immunity and protection on the table. 
 [sighs] 
 We can't make a deal unless we have an idea of something we're getting in return. 
 You can't make a deal at all. 
 Only the D.A. can. 
 Fine, but we need to talk about Antoine Tyler. 
 I'm not... 
 I'm not gonna wait on a missing child. 
 We have a responsibility... 
 He's fine, all right? 
 And we're supposed to take your word for this. 
 I'm his doctor. 
 I understand that. 
 But if this kid's in some fleabag motel out there, I swear to God... 
 He's in a medical facility. 
 I am monitoring him closely. 
 I share his location when I have a deal... 
 Not before. 
 Fine, Doctor. Fine. 
 We'll set it up. 
 Seriously, Gretchen, you want me to arrange medical transport for your patient? 
 You want me to pay off an ambulance, fine. 
 But it would be safer and quieter if you did it. 
 You know, I'm not the only partner in this place, and every minute you're here, I'm risking my license. 
 I'm trying to get the kid out of here before the cops get involved. 
 Do you want that or not? 
 Fine! 
 I'll make a call. 
 Good. 
 We'll do it Tuesday when nobody's around. 
 Speaking of, I moved the kid upstairs. 
 What? There's nobody up there. 
 He's a kid, and you have him on an empty floor? 
 Yep. See, that's how you hide somebody. 
 You put him where the security cams are dark and nobody's around. 
 What if he needs something? 
 [sighs] That's why you're here, isn't it? 
 All right, listen, this side's empty. 
 There's still a few folks in the other wing. 
 So get some scrubs on and try, try to look like you belong here, got it? 
 Oh... one more thing... if he's here past Tuesday, it's another 25 grand, and you and me are gonna have that dinner you keep saying no to. 
 Believe me, we'll both be gone.

 Hello? 
 John, it's Bridget. 
 John : Hi, there. What can I do for you? 
 Were you planning on coming to the hospital today? 
 Uh, no, I wasn't. 
 Well, we've got a situation here. 
 Some young men came in this morning with vague complaints... 
 Headaches, stomach pain, that kind of thing. 
 And why are you calling me with this? 
 'Cause they looked like gang members, and they're asking to see you. 
 John : All right, uh, do you want me to... 
 I want to know what's going on. 
 I assume this is related to the package you gave me yesterday. 
 Yes, and I'm doing everything I can to resolve the situation. 
 You're the one that gave me an envelope to deliver to the police if you die. 
 So your reassurances right now, not reassuring. 
 John : I understand that and... 
 Please, just do what you need to do, quickly. 
 [cell phones beep] 
 [sighs] 
 Gretchen : You been behaving yourself? 
 Antoine : Yeah, I guess. 
 I want to cause all kinds of trouble, but I can't hardly walk. 
 Still weak? 
 Kind of. 
 It's a little better. 
 Yeah. 
 Is the pain bad? 
 I can tough it out. 
 That ain't the real problem. 
 The real problem is this place don't got cable. 
 It sucks. 
 [laughs] 
 Yeah, well, hopefully it won't suck much longer. 
 We'll do tests for the next couple days and then try to get you home. 
 Sound good? 
 You know it. 
 All right, well, you enjoy your crappy TV for a sec. 
 I'll be right back, okay?

 Hello? 
 Gretchen : What the hell did you do? 
 Wait. What are you talking about? 
 I'm talking about the fact that we specifically discussed not talking to the cops about Dr. Blair's. 
 Gretchen, what do you mean? I-I didn't tell them. 
 You must have said something, because I'm at Blair's, and I'm looking at Detective Holden out the window right now. 
 They... I... 
 Look, they pressed me on Antoine. 
 All I said was that he was at a medical facility. 
 Holden's a detective. You don't think he can figure something like that out? 
 Wait. Just... just calm down. 
 Just get out of there, and we'll deal with this later. 
 I can call Holden and tell him if he doesn't leave... 
 Something's not right. 
 What? 
 Holden's taking a gun out of an evidence bag. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Why would he... 
 I don't know. 
 He's got a silencer. 
 He's putting it on the gun, Doctor. 
 You need to get here right now. 
 Okay, change of plans... we're gonna get you out of here now. 
 Now? What? 
 John, if Antoine is in danger, you need to call the police. 
 The police are the problem. 
 Holden and his partner lied to me. 
 Why would they lie? 
 I don't know. 
 But Holden's at the clinic right now. 
 He has a stolen gun. I think he might be there to hurt Antoine. 
 And when you get there, what... 
 Sam, Sam, I can't just stay here and let this happen. 
 I can't. 
 So, listen, take Ollie, go to the lake house. 
 Don't tell anyone and don't talk to the police. 
 I can't... 
 Please. 
 I just need to know you're safe. 
 Just promise me you'll leave here as soon as you can. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, can you get up? 
 I don't know. 
 I know it hurts. 
 But it's important, and I need you to try, okay? 
 [grunts in pain] 
 Aah! 
 sh1t, sh1t. 
 Okay. 
 [groaning] 
 No walking, all right. 
 [groans in pain] 
 Aah! 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 I promise. 
 Just... just relax and stay still. 
 I'm gonna go get something to move you, okay?

 Darius, it's me, John. 
 I thought I was clear last night, Doc. 
 We ain't friends no more. 
 Yes, I understand that, but... 
 Darius : Ain't no buts about it, Doc. 
 Would you please just listen to me? 
 You remember Holden, the head of the Gang Task Force? 
 Yeah, I know Holden. 
 Yeah, well, he's tracked down Antoine somehow. 
 I don't know what he's doing, but I know he's lied to me and... 
 [horn blares] 
 He's at the surgical center right now with a gun and a silencer. 
 He's just taken them out of an evidence bag. 
 Where you at? 
 I'm about ten minutes from the surgery center. 
 I'll meet you there. 
 sh1t! 
 [wheezing] 
 All right, you ready? 
 It hurts. 
 Okay, the doctor's coming. Just hang on tight. 
 We're rolling out of here, okay? 
 [elevator bell dings] 
 sh1t. 
 What's wrong? 
 Somebody's coming. We have to hide, okay? 
 I know it hurts, but you have to stay quiet, okay? 
 [wheezing] 
 Shh. 
 [wheezing] 
 Can I help you with something? 
 Sorry, I thought this wing was empty. 
 It is. We had some staph bacteria issues. 
 I'm the germ patrol. 
 Looking for someone? 
 No, I'm with the... insurance company. 
 We're doing some site visits. 
 They said I wouldn't be in anyone's way if I look around. 
 Be my guest. 
 You may not want to touch anything, though. 
 Germs all over this place.

 [wheezing] 
 No, it's been mothballed till they're sure it's not contaminated. 
 Sir? 
 I, uh... I just got a message. 
 I need to check on some kid in A wing. 
 You gonna be okay here on your own? 
 Kid? 
 Yeah. 
 Not sure how he even ended up here, and they keep switching his room. 
 You know, actually, maybe, uh... 
 Maybe I'll come with you. 
 Still some other areas I need to visit. 
 Yeah, not a problem. 
 Right through here. 
 
 
 
 [tires screeching] 
 What the hell did you tell that cop? 
 Nothing. I told Holden I was keeping Antoine safe. 
 The next thing I knew, he was here. 
 And where's he at now? 
 Look, all I know is Gretchen was checking on Antoine when he showed up. 
 I called you as soon as I heard. 
 Last night the cops was gonna solve all your problems, and today you called me. 
 Let's go. 
 [elevator bell dings] 
 They make you wear that mask all the time? 
 Yeah, you have to wear it when you clean, and then you have to change your clothes before you see patients... It's a pain. 
 So where's this kid you're checking on? 
 I'm not sure. 
 I got to find out at the nurse's station. 
 [cell phone vibrating] 
 I think that's your phone. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Sorry, I got to run downstairs for a sec. 
 Doctor forgot a chart at the front desk. 
 The nurse's station is around the corner if you need help with anything. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Thanks. 
 This house on the lake of yours, it's got food and bedding, right? 
 Yeah, there's plenty of canned food there. 
 We'll be fine. 
 Here's some extra blankets in case it gets cold. 
 Thanks. 
 Sam. 
 Look, it's the police. 
 John said it wasn't safe to talk to the cops, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Why don't you grab Ollie and get out of here? 
 Take the back way. 
 What, are you serious? 
 Please. 
 Just take Ollie and go. 
 Ollie, come here, buddy. 
 Hawthorne : Good afternoon. 
 Can I help you boys with something? 
 Yeah, we'd like to speak with John or Samantha Ellison. 
 Oh, well, you got the wrong place, 'cause they're not here. 
 Oh, is that so? 
 Well, we were informed that they were staying here. 
 Sounds like you got some bad information. 
 Sir, it's for their own safety, so if you don't mind, we'd like to... 
 I do mind. 
 You're on private property, so I want you to get off. 
 Hawthorne : I don't know what your problem is, but we're here for... 
 Mom, what's happening? 
 Shh. 
 Stay quiet, Ollie, okay? Stick close to me. 
 Hawthorne : Sir, I don't think you realize the importance here. 
 Gary : Oh, I understand the importance, all right, but I don't see a warrant, so that means you're trespassing. 
 Look, pal, I'm not leaving until I have a look around. 
 Yeah? Well, show me the goddamn warrant. 
 Shut up about the warrant! 
 I want you to go around back. 
 You, go to the other side. 
 I'm going through the house. 
 I want a full sweep. 
 Let's go! 
 Okay. 
 You follow me. 
 You guys are way out of line. 
 We are done. 
 man : Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 That's enough! 
 Let's go, Ollie. 
 Sir, I need you to calm down, you hear me? 
 Cuff him. Get him to the car. 
 Got a lock? 
 Yeah. 
 [birds cawing] 
 Would you put that away? 
 We see that cop, we're gonna need it. 
 Yeah, we don't know that yet. 
 Oh, we do now. 
 A lot of sh1t is starting to make sense. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Gang war started when a Loco stash house got robbed. 
 Loco boss's brother got killed. 
 That's how come they shot 'Toine. 
 Family for family. 
 Yeah, but if you robbed them, you know that they're... 
 We didn't do sh1t. We don't know where no goddamn Loco stash house is. 
 You know who does? 
 Holden? 
 You're saying Holden robbed them? 
 What, you surprised 'cause he a cop? 
 Welcome to the world, Doc. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Wait. W-why did he come after Antoine? 
 Word's out Easy wants peace. 
 Fighting stops. People start talking. 
 Locos gonna figure out who really hit them, and that detective's a dead man. 
 But if he kill 'Toine, make it look like the Locos... 
 The fighting goes on. 
 And that cop gets away clean. 
 So, if you don't mind, I'm gonna keep this where I can get it. 
 Darius, I... I thought that you... 
 I know what you thought. 
 Seen a lot of white boys thought they had all the answers. 
 [cell phone vibrating] 
 Yeah, Gretchen, we're here. 
 Can you bring Antoine downstairs? 
 No, no, I... You have to come here. 
 What is it? What's going on? 
 Something is wrong with Antoine. 
 [wheezing] 
 Gretchen : Get up here as fast as you can. 
 [wheezing] 
 Keep breathing, okay? 
 Just keep breathing. 
 What happened? 
 He's in respiratory distress. 
 Tachycardic, and it's been getting worse. 
 What the hell is this? You told me 'Toine was ready to go home. 
 He fell, all right? I was trying to move him, and he fell. 
 He keep it up like this, that cop ain't gonna need to kill him. 
 You are not helping. 
 Sounds like a tension pneumothorax. 
 Visceral pleura must have been compromised by the infection ruptured from the fall. 
 Gretchen : It's gonna be okay. 
 There you go. 
 Hurry it up. 
 You can't hurry this. 
 If I get this wrong, Antoine gets a lot worse. 
 [wheezes] 
 Aah! 
 What did you do? 
 Hold on! 
 Give me one milligram midazolam. 
 Darius : He gonna be all right? 
 He should be. 
 I'm just gonna give him something to calm him down. 
 Okay, he's good, but we need to get him out of here now. 
 Quick, go get the car ready. 
 Okay. Which way we going? 
 Left toward the back elevator. 
 That's gonna get us to the alley? 
 Yeah. 
 No. 
 'Toine! 
 Holden : Don't you... don't you move a goddamn inch. 
 [both breathing heavily] 
 Oof! 
 Just keep moving, sweetie. Don't look back, okay? 
 Hawthorne : Hey! 
 Hey, hold up! 
 Can I talk to you? 
 Detective Hawthorne, APD. 
 Yeah, what can I do for you, Detective? 
 I'm looking for some folks. 
 They may have come from the woods back there. 
 Really? Wait. What's this all about? 
 It's a criminal investigation. 
 We believe that the suspects may have recently fled a house nearby. 
 I'm not sure, Detective. 
 Well, I suggest you get sure. 
 This is important. 
 Interfering with a police investigation is a serious offense. 
 So I'll ask you one more time. 
 Have you seen them? 
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I guess I saw them. 
 A blonde lady and a boy. 
 And? Where are they? 
 Well, they hitched a ride on a rig heading north. 
 Red cab... think it said "Siebels Freight"? 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 You're sure? 
 100%. 
 He just took off right before you came out here. 
 [cell phone beeps] 
 Hey, there's a truck stop over the ridge. 
 Come pick me up. We got to move. 
 Nice try with the mask. 
 I was almost out the door when I realized I'd seen them eyes before. 
 Same night this asshole here ran out of the E.R. 
 [wheezing] 
 Oh, damn. 
 Damn it, damn. God damn. 
 No, no, no! 
 You don't want to do this. 
 I didn't want any of this, you son of a bitch. 
 It's a little late now, isn't it? 
 No. 
 No, it's not. 
 I know how it is. 
 Oh, do you? 
 I know how it feels to have something you did spin out of control. 
 But don't make it worse. 
 Shut your mouth! 
 You know, none of this would have happened if you'd have just stayed in the goddamn hospital where you belonged! 
 You... you thought you would stop these animals from killing each other? 
 [scoffs] 
 You made it worse. 
 You did! 
 You screwed everything up, and now I g... 
 And now I got... 
 I got to finish this. 
 No, no, no! No. 
 sh1t! 
 Wait! 
 Think about this. 
 Three more murders... 
 Antoine's a child. 
 You want to live with that? 
 We can work through this. 
 All you got to do is put down the gun. 
 That's it. 
 And this can all finally... be over. 
 I'm sorry, Doc. 
 I can't. 
 John! 
 [gurgles] 
 Oh, God. 
 Is Antoine... 
 Midazolam kicked in. He's sleeping. 
 Oh, God. 
 [cell phone beeps] 
 John? 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm calling the police. 
 No, you can't do that. 
 I just killed a man. 
 You just killed a dirty cop who started a gang war. 
 We have to tell someone. I... 
 Why? 
 Gretchen. 
 Any gang member in town could have came and done this and ran off. 
 And nobody even knows you're here! 
 Gretchen, I have... 
 If you call the police, here's what happens. 
 You get arrested for killing a cop, and you go to jail and hope they sort out what happened here. 
 And maybe they do. Maybe they don't. 
 But there's one thing that's for sure, and that's everything that you've worked for, everything that we've worked for, goes to sh1t. 
 [clears throat] 
 Gretchen, this... This has to end. 
 What ends if you do this? 
 What? The gang war? 
 No, that gets worse. 
 No one finds out what you know, which is the man you just killed is the one who started all of this. 
 And what about... 
 What about your family? 
 Do their problems end? 
 What about Antoine? 
 He loses the one person that can save him right now? 
 Okay. 
 Doctor... with what you know, you can save a lot of lives... 
 But not if you make that phone call. 
 [dog barking] 
 So you're saying I got ripped off by a cop? 
 That my little brother... was killed by a cop? 
 Yes. 
 No, bullshit. 
 Bullshit! 
 Just listen to him, please. 
 Listen, chica, you helping out Sarita,  that got you this meeting. 
 That doesn't mean he gets to come down here and lie to me. 
 That doesn't mean he leaves here alive. 
 Holden stole your money. 
 Then when he heard the Vine City Crew might make peace, he tried to keep the war going to keep you from finding out. 
 No. 
 No, no! 
 Everybody knows you roll with Vine City, and you come down here to... 
 I came down here to tell you the truth... that the man who killed your brother is dead, and Ezera Tyler is willing to end this if you are. 
 I know what it is to lose someone you love. 
 I know the pain. I know the anger. 
 But, please... this is your chance to make your little brother's death mean something. 
 Get out of here. 
 Go! 
 Dad? 
 Rebecca : Why do you think I got sick? 
 Mom says things happen for a reason... 
 But I'm not sure if that's true. 
 Good night, buddy. 
 I'll be right outside. 
 How's Ollie? 
 He's okay. He's asleep. 
 Good. 
 [sighs] He's had a day no child should have. 
 Have you thought any more about... 
 [grunts] About what I asked? 
 John... you want me to help cover up a crime... not just one, more than I can count. 
 It's your decision. 
 No, it'll never work. 
 That detective... He arrested your father. 
 He knows what you did. 
 He can't have people asking questions any more than we can. 
 The bodies in the clinic? 
 It looks like a gang shooting, and as long we say nothing, that's all it will be. 
 All I want is to keep this family together. 
 Even now? 
 Even now. 
 How... after everything that's happened? 
 You know what happens when a shooting victim comes in with a bullet inside them... 
 Someone like Antoine? 
 Unless the bullet is lodged in a vital organ, we leave it where it is... not because it's good, but because taking it out will cause even more damage. 
 John : It's hard, 'cause a bullet wound, when you look at it, it's awful. 
 The bullet tears through everything tissue, bone. 
 Shockwaves from the impact destroy even more, and it hurts to see that bullet inside someone's body and just leave it there. 
 It feels so wrong. 
 It goes against every instinct you have as a doctor. 
 But as wrong as it feels, it's the best thing you can do. 
 In time, the immune system kicks in, fighting off infection, preventing further damage. 
 Inflammation dies down, and the damage that you thought could never be repaired, somehow, gradually, begins to get better. 
 Of course, there may be setbacks, but the wound does heal. 
 Tissue grows back. 
 Bones knit together. 
 Where old connections can't be repaired, new ones are made. 
 Finally, as the months pass, the bullet becomes encased in scar tissue... sealed off. 
 I'm not saying life ever goes back to normal, but it does go on. 
 [siren wailing] 
 Let's check the lab results on bed four and get a CBC on nine. 
 Okay, but bed nine doesn't like needles, and bed nine is way off his meds. 
 Well, do your best. 
 Did you check on Mr. Williams yet? 
 I did, and he is ready for discharge. 
 Well, tell Sherry, because she is waiting on the bed. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, and you have a phone call on line two. 
 Who is it? 
 Beats me. 
 Sadly, I didn't goo secretary class in medical school. 
 They said it's urgent. 
 [sighs] This is Dr. Ellison. 
 man : Dr. Ellison, I'm sorry to bother you. 
 I'm sure you're busy. 
 That's all right. Who am I speaking with? 
 I run a chain of clinics in the area. 
 I was wondering if you might find the time to meet with me. 
 I have an urgent matter to discuss. 
 Okay, what is it? 
 It'd be better to talk about that in person. 
 Well, you know, I'm in the middle of a shift... and you didn't mention your name. 
 No, I didn't. 
 I run cancer clinics, Dr. Ellison. 
 You know one of them. 
 The Sandy Springs Clinic? 
 [screaming] 
 Uh... I'm not familiar with it. 
 You're sure about that? 
 We lost that facility a while back to a fire. 
 Listen, before you call the police... 
 Who said anything about the police? 
 What? 
 What do you want? 
 I want you to stop what you're doing, leave the hospital, and go to the southeast parking garage. 
 You have three minutes.
