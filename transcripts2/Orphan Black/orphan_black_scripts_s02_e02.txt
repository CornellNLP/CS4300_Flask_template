 I'm your birth mother. Mrs. S, she's not who she says she is. 
 You know what to do. 
 Kira! 
 What the hell is going on? Did Rachel just take my family? 
 We've come here to take you to Kira. 
 Tonight there's a big event at the Dyad. Rachel will be there. 
 How do you get next to Rachel with Daniel in the way? 
 Rachel's a very busy woman, but if you tell me where you are, I'll bring you to her. 
 Who in the hell are you? 
 This is our mistake. 
 I want my own lab. Thank you, Dr. Leekie. 
 You're Sarah. 
 Yeah, nice to meet you too. 
 I want my daughter. If you don't have her, you're dead! 
 The Dyad people. Somebody else took Kira. 
 I know. The cowboy who took the shotgun blast was a religious extremist. 
 A Prolethean. 
 Helena's people. 
 (indistinct speaking) 
 (monitor beeping) 
 OK, Eastern European accent, and... Scarification? 
 Angel wings. 
 No ID, but these are the contents of her pockets. 
 Sugar packs, lollipops... 
 Shot point blank in the chest and she walks in? 
 How is she even alive? 
 (gasp) 
 It's OK. (High-pitched whine) 
 What do these Proletheans want with your daughter? 
 I don't know, Art. 
 Everybody's after us. 
 (Knocking on door) 
 Hey. 
 We're gonna find her. 
 OK. 
 OK? 
 Yeah. Thank you. 
 Good. 
 Hello, Arthur. 
 I can't believe you let a cop into the Clone Club. 
 Yeah, well, I'm over it. 
 Finally this whole shit-show is starting to make sense. 
 So, if these religious freaks have Kira, how do we find them? 
 (ringtone) 
 It's out of town. 
 We've got a number of branches. 
 Hello? 
 We've just got to figure out which one. 
 Kira? Kira? 
 Give it! 
 Yeah. 
 Kira? Hello? 
 Mommy, I'm not supposed to call. 
 I'm so glad you did. Where are you, baby? 
 I don't know. I'm scared. 
 There's a weird man here. 
 Kira? Kira?! 
  It's a listed number. It's a motel in Bridgeleigh County. 
 Let's go, or they'll be gone. 
 Whoa. It could be a trap. 
 She's going with me. 
 Yeah, it could still be a trap. 
 Fee, stop. 
 Wait! Just a minute, please. 
 New clone phones. 
 I'll get these ones to Cosima and Alison. 
 Numbers are already stored in there. This one's for me. 
 Thank you. 
 When we're back together, we're leaving, yeah? 
 Yeah. Costa Rica. I've heard that one before. 
 Look, I need you to keep telling me we can make it. 
 We can. 
 We remember Aynsley's warmth, her devotion to family, to community. 
 We remember early mornings with the Bailey Downs Ice Queens, long evenings on stage rehearsing various theater productions. 
 And some of us remember book club, or as Aynsley called it, full-contact reading. 
 She wanted us to... 
 Self-reflect. 
 And she would say almost daily, "Be true to who you are." 
 She has got a lot of gall coming here after sleeping with Chad. 
 (whispering) 
 If you wanted to have a glass right now, I wouldn't blame you one bit. 
 No, thank you, Donnie. 
 I think I'll stay clearheaded indefinitely. 
 Mom. 
 What? Where did you get these flowers? 
 They're Aynsley's. 
 What? No, no, no, no. 
 You take those back. 
 I got it, I got it. 
 Then we can go home. 
 Yes, please. 
 Here, hold my coat. Guys, what are you thinking? Come on. 
 Sorry, Father. 
 Alison? 
 Mm. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Oh. Oh, thank you, Sarah, really. I feel like the play is saving my life right now. 
 You lost a friend, and they shouldn't be treating you like this. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, that's OK. 
 Oops. 
 See you at rehearsal. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 (cell phone vibrating) 
 Margaret, hi. 
 Ali? 
 Mm-hmm? 
 Shall we? 
 Yep. 
 OK. Gemma, here you go. 
 Come on. 
 You did well to save her, Mark. 
 Helena is the twin sister of the mother, the one that got away. 
 She almost didn't make it. Real close. 
 Yeah. Here, steady her for me. Be gentle. She shouldn't balk a bit. 
 All right. Now, easy, girl. 
 (cow mooing) 
 Hand me the AI gun. 
 Now we just... 
 Slide that in directly into the cervix. 
 And... 
 The rest is up to the Lord; just helped him along a little bit. 
 Amen, Pastor. 
 We're gonna need a little help too, Mark, getting that girl out of the hospital. 
 Yeah, I imagine so. 
 Well, Henrik, am I making up another bed or not? 
 That is entirely dependent on Mark here, Bonnie. 
 I'll do my best. 
 You know we love you like a son, right? You're the only one we trust with all this. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, what,you're accusing me of  colluding with Sarah to... To, I'm sorry, shit-kick Rachel? I don't know... Why would I do that? 
 Aldous, Sarah, she's a con artist. She fooled us too. 
 Did she? 
 She stole your pass card. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm sorry. None of us ever trusted her. 
 Let me just say... 
 Rachel takes insult very personally. 
 If you want to help Sarah, you'd be uniquely positioned to do so here at the Dyad. 
 I for one would like to avoid a war. 
 And I just want to make crazy science with you in our new lab. 
 They're gone. 
 sh1t! 
 When? How long? 
 About an hour ago. 
 A young girl matching Kira's description and some guy. Hey, come on. 
 Wait, Siobhan wasn't with them? 
 There was no woman at all? No, just the guy. 
 Hey. 
 Art. 
 Find something? 
 Yeah. 
 That's hers. 
 Hold up. 
 That's Daniel, Rachel's bloody Doberman. 
 You stay put. 
 I've been hoping to run into this guy again. 
 Police officer. Put your hands on the car. 
 I said get your hands on the car. 
 Can I help you, Detective Bell? 
 Hm? 
 I have a permit for that. 
 You're a private investigator this time. 
 You're gonna regret this, professionally speaking. 
 We know where you live. Why do I doubt that? 
 We know where you work. 
 Keep your hands on the car. 
 You're a very bright man, Detective. 
 What are you doing here, huh? What are you doing here? 
 (indistinct talking) 
 (whispering): If you want to see Kira, you better shut up and get in. 
 This is your stop. 
 If you don't get too stroppy, I'll help you out. 
 Where is my daughter? 
 Someone'll be along. 
 Ooh! 
 Where is she? You piece of sh1t! 
 Ugh! 
 Stop. 
 What the bloody hell? 
 Bloody hell! 
 I'm sorry, Benjamin. You didn't sign up for that. 
 No, I certainly did not. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 Relax. Kira's fine. 
 What, he's not a Prolethean? 
 No, chicken, you just passed through an airlock. 
 A what? 
 An airlock. When Kira called you, I knew you'd come for her and bring your troubles with you. 
 Here's her phone. It was ringing. 
 I took out the batteries. 
 Thanks, Ben. Safe home. 
 You too, S. 
 What happened with Amelia? 
 I'm not telling you shite till I see Kira. 
 Better get a move on; we've quite a hike. 
 Whose side are you on, S? 
 Yours, love. It's always been yours. 
 Now,  while it may lack some luster, the old wing is where our most sensitive research takes place. 
 Like when you were sterilizing lunatics in the '30s? 
 Ah, before my time. 
 She's... She's being cheeky again. 
 She's knows the Dyad was built on vaccines. 
 Yes, polio, Spanish influenza... 
 Manufactured right here, shipped all over the world, and millions of lives saved. Oh, so this is where you keep the clones. Ah, obviously you're part of a high-security program. Yeah, most restricted projects are entirely compartmentalized. Right, so smart people don't know what they're actually working on. Ah, but you will. You're working on yourself. Ah, do the honors? (beeping) I was right; it's clone jail. It's not. You know, if I wanted an obsolete lab, I could just go to a community college. We're going to customize it. Here your opportunities will be endless. Just last month, I emailed a vaccine to a colleague in Delhi who then recreated it on a 3D biological printer! That is completely amazing. Think of what we could build in this room. Please, make a list. Equipment, personnel. Just... Blue sky a little. Together. Well, I know nobody likes to touch a dead body, but I was really hoping you'd help me clean up the blood. I'll help. ♪ We are blood buds till the end ♪ 
♪ It is written in our hearts ♪ 
♪ We will be together till the day ♪ 
♪ That death takes us apart ♪ 
♪ Now weeeee ♪ 
♪ Must heed the call, clean the brains off the wall ♪ 
♪ The task may be unpleasant but it's ours ♪ 
♪ Try not to complain as you're scrubbing out the stain ♪ 
♪ This is dirty work, dirty work. ♪ 
♪ Sing, sing, sing away the hours ♪ 
♪ shout till our throats are sore ♪ Sorry. She just takes left, right? Left, left. Right? Let's do it again? No. We're gonna take five. And I mean five. Carter, no more sobbing. Alison, please. OK. Sorry. It's OK. Right here. Mm-hmm. OK, now, do you feel that? Mm-hmm. That is you breathing very high. Yes. That's anxiety residue. OK. What you want to do... Is you want to breathe... from here, from the sacrum. I... From the sacrum to the diaphragm and out. Let's do it, OK? I'm not sure that's my sacrum. Now right... feel it right here, and in. And ouuuuuuuuuuut. Ouuuuuuuuut. Excuse me. Ouuuu... Ah! Thank God. Sir. Everybody, this is Felix, my acting coach. Hello! You all look wonderful. Hi, I'm Alexander. I'm the director. Yes, I've seen where that hand's been. OK, let's just... We'll be right back. Thank you. Donnie is your husband; Aynsley is your monitor. No, no! I was wrong. Yes! No! I was wrong, Felix. Vague text messages, they didn't prove anything! You have a history of jumping to monitor conclusions. What have I done? Aynsley's dead. I'm sorry, what? There was an, uh, an accident with her garbage disposal. Her scarf got caught and... she choked to death. Oh, my god. And I was there. I watched it happen, Felix. I didn't do anything about it. Shh, OK, OK, OK. Look, are you joking? No! No, no. I thought it was her. We all did. We... It was Donnie all along! OK. I killed Aynsley. No, no, darling. Yes, I did. Yes. Well... I mean... not really, you know, just like hardly. Oh, God. You can't tell Sarah, please. No. You can't tell anybody. I... I can't... I can't go to jail. Oh, my god. I have two children. Nobody's going to jail, OK? No one's going to jail. We just need to prove that Donnie's really your monitor. How? I mean, he's bamboozled me for all of these years. He is very good at being evil. Yes. Yes, he is, terribly. So here's what we do. We set a trap. Give him some monitor-ish information and see if he reacts like a monitor. Uh-huh. OK. Have you got any ideas, or do you just want to keep drinking? I think I need to keep drinking for a while and then I'll have an idea. I made things worse, Siobhan. Why didn't you call me? I couldn't trust the phones. There was more than one person watching the house. I knew someone was coming, so I tossed the place. I made it look like an abduction to confuse the issue. I put Kira first. You think I didn't? Hey, I know this place. This is where we landed when we left the UK. Hello, Sarah. Welcome back. Barry. The Birdwatchers. My old network. They helped us disappear once. They're helping again. Well, look at you. Brenda. Yeah? Yeah. She remembers. Well done. Such a beauty, and all grown up. I wouldn't say either. Ohhh. (Kira): Mommy! Monkey! Come here. I was so worried about you. I didn't know where you were. We came to the Birdwatchers. I know. Are you all right? Are you sure? Come on inside. I know I could use a drink. (Brenda chuckles.) You could have answered your phone. What's the point? I don't know, quash the wild rumors you're about to get suspended? My union rep's on it. No. So, what, I gotta beat it out of ya? What the hell happened? You know that lawyer, the real connected one, pulled the rug out from under us during the Sarah Manning thing? Well, we crossed paths, and words were exchanged. He's the one trying to get you suspended? I got something that might help. You know Carp, the patrol guy? Mentions he's got the weirdest Jane Doe in hospital. Holy sh1t. Yeah. That's, what, like number five? Don't go there, Angie. Just drop it. Alison Hendricks, just drop the whole thing But you're getting screwed, Art. And what about justice for Beth? Look, I'm serious. Leave it alone. You're not going there. I'm not going there. I'm here about the Jane Doe that came in last night, the gunshot vic. Sure, she's right down here. Where'd she go? (Angie sighs.) You're kidding. Who are you? Family. 
 
 Nervous, Gracie? It's not usual, is it? I'm sure we seem as strange to them as they do to us. Just do as your father says. (Woman): I'm not sure. (women talking indistinctly) Mary! Come, come, come, girl. Hello, Gracie. Will it eat? Of course she will. Aw, Gracie, don't be scared. She needs our care, and we need her trust. (whipping) (man grunting) (whipping) (man grunting) (whipping) (man grunting) Forgive me. An old custom. Hello, Tomas. I am so grateful to your family for my rescue, and for hers. I found myself... praying for her soul. Well, that's not so crazy, is it? Abominations have no soul. Though one could easily mistake the bullet missing her heart for a miracle. It is a miracle, my friend. Your charge... Is a genetic anomaly. She's a mirror. See, her internal organs, all reversed. What? It's a condition that, uh... That sometimes occurs with identical twins. Kind of a yin-yang sort of thing. One of them's right-handed, one of them's left-handed. Whew. One of them has her heart on the left side... And one of them has their heart... Her heart is on the wrong side. This is surely the mark of corruption. Yeah, well, that's where I disagree with you. You see, I steered my faith through science at MIT, and what I see here... What I see here is God opening a whole new door. Well, what you see is not who she is. Your "new order" should appreciate this wretch is not merely an affront; she is the war for the future of creation. I got not argument with you there. You're welcome here, Tomas, both of you, for as long as it takes her to recover. Hey, look, that's where Uncle Felix bashed his head open. Thanks to his foster sister, who was helping him down the stairs headfirst. He asked for it. We don't get many through these days, but we could still kit out an army if we had to. All sizes and shapes. Mrs. S says I have your old bed. Yeah, I think you do. Look, that's me, and that's Uncle Felix. Oh, Marjorie, that's horrible. But I can't. I can't today. No. Absolutely not. Now make it sound all dire, you know. And, oh, mention Sarah. They're all obsessed with Sarah. No, not even an emergency. I can't talk to Sarah. I can't. I... I... That's not my business. Now set the hook. (softly): I absolutely cannot do it today. No, no. Fine. (opera music playing) Looking good, Teddy. Do you need a stretch? I need to go out. It's... It's absolutely essential. I followed her to the cemetery. You said to call if she had contact with a Sarah someone, right? Manning. Sarah Manning. I don't know who that is. Oh... Here comes someone. Yep, someone's coming. Hang on. Alison. Sarah, hi. Oh, honey. Look at you. You're shaking. Oh. Really nice of you to come by on such short notice. Of course I came. It's a lot, eh? Aynsley passing, and taking over her role. OK, I'm back. It's Sarah Stubbs. Who is that? She's in the play with Alison. Wasn't that...? My husband. Uh, I don't know her very well, but she's probably early 30s. I guess you'd say plus-size. Donald... Stop talking. That's not the right Sarah. OK, well, then what do you want me to do now? Hang up, Donnie. Hello? (phone beep) Oh! Alison. Hello, Donnie. Ah, I guess you're wondering, um... Hmm? Honey... You haven't even cried yet. I knew you were coming here to see Aynsley. I was worried. Worried? That I might... do something drastic? To myself? To you? I was just worried. Would you like to join us? No. Um... You be with your friend. I'm sorry. I love you. She's not used to being cooped up. Yeah? Makes two of us. So, what were you planning to do with her? Before I showed up? I've organized drivers, booked two flights on the red-eye to London tonight. London is where this all started. Will you follow? You and Fee? They're for me and Kira, Sarah. You and Felix can stay here with Brenda. When it's safe, I'll organize to bring you. There are people in the UK I haven't seen in a long time, people with answers. She's my daughter. And your next move is what exactly? Because so far, you have done a piss-poor job of keeping her safe. Yeah, it's all my fault. Yeah? No. No, but... It is your reality. And my care of Kira has always been bulletproof, has it not? What is this? Project LEDA? Well, you clearly know something I don't. Amelia gave that to me. Well, what does she say it is? She warned me about you as she died of a stab wound from Helena. She put you with these people. I'm sorry, Sarah. I'm very sorry, but... I swear to you, I don't know who they are. Brenda, you've outdone yourself. It's nice to feed a proper pack again. To safe travels. (Siobhan): Mm-hmm. Brenda used to run strike kitchens on nothing more than scrap meat and canned veg. I tried to keep Siobhan in the kitchen, but she preferred scrubbing Kalashnikov's to pots and pans. What kind of strikers need machineguns? I was on... Guns for Funds. (Brenda chuckles.) Running weapons to finance freedom. It made a lot of sense at the time. Not particularly effective, but good times. Then we lost Jamie. Who's Jamie? Jamie's my dad. There's always a high price to pay for righting wrongs. Does this extractor fan even work? No. That's OK. We'll get it fixed. Right. You're making, like, a shopping list for me? I am. OK. Chill zone up here, with, like, a Persian rug. (Delphine laughs.) And a really nice leather couch. Hang on. Does a GeneChip system make a two-channel array moot? Moot? Aw. (laughing) You're so cute. (beeping) (door opening) Well, so much for security. Hello. Rachel Duncan. You sure are. Um... I'm Cosima, the real Cosima; not the one who... kicked your ass or whatever. Gotta love concealer. I hear you're very clever. Yeah, I was clever when I was like six. Doctor Cormier, now that we've met, you'll need to sign a new confidentiality agreement. Would you leave us, please? Yes, of course. So... You're gay. My sexuality is not the most interesting thing about me. How are you feeling? These are the results of your last medical tests. What tests? You visited your university GP two weeks ago. Blood tests. You have a high lymphocyte count along with high CRP and ESR. You were aware of Katja Obinger's undiagnosed condition, yes? Yeah. Here's her data, redacted to the pertinent. It's in our best interest to eliminate genetic predisposition. Um, then you should let me examine the original genome. Oh, that's not possible. Why not? I assure you, the original DNA was robust. We believe our issues stem from the cloning procedure. Dr. Cormier will schedule you an MRI. And here's something else I'd like you to engage with. Here's what little we know of Sarah Manning's upbringing and environment. And here's her sequenced genome. I want you to tell me why she's different than we are. You mean, why she of all of us can have a child? Do make yourself at home. (phone ringing) Our next driver, confirming. Take it outside, please, Barry. Hold on a minute. Why does he need to take it outside? So none of us know the details. It's just the way it's done, love. Aw, monkey. Hey. You sleepy, monkey? You want to take a kip before we leave? That's a good idea. We've got a really big trip ahead. Any goodbyes are just for now, OK? Yeah. (whispering): OK, come on. Come on. (Kira): Should I put my pajamas on? Depends what you have to tell me. What's wrong? What did you show Mrs. S outside? That. Why? That's Amelia's. I saw it when she was snooping in her stuff. Why was Mrs. S snooping in her stuff? I bet Mrs. S has loads of secrets. Some of them are good, yeah? (whispering): Maybe, but I don't think so. We should go. Yeah. We're on hold. If there's trouble, I need to know. Barry? Is there trouble? I'm to make a call in an hour. Usual delays. Barry, I'd like to talk to the driver myself. You can't. I'm the contact. If we delay, we'll be in daylight on the route with the most cameras. Well, we'll change the route. Barry, I'll call and get it sorted out. I think I'd like to review it personally, Brenda. (ignition not turning over) Stop! Hands! (truck starting) Sarah! Mommy! Get down! What the hell are you doing? For God's sake, she's just a little girl. We were all little girls once. Not like this one. Meaning what... Exactly? It means... Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Get out! Get out of the truck or Kira will get hurt! Open the door! Sarah! I can't let you go! (Kira screams.) (Sarah yelling) Ah! You bitch! Ah! (Gunshot) Mommy? Stay down! Stay down! (Brenda breathing unsteadily) Not my boy. Not my boy. Could you just tell me why? After all we have been through together. Why? A lifetime of bluster about change and justice while we starve for our troubles. Who got to you? I found God. It turns out... The Lord has deep pockets. You sold us to the Proletheans. Now you tell me: who are these cursed children you brought into our lives? They're Project LEDA. I don't know what that is. Good. (gunshot) Bollocks. Alison? It's him. Donnie took the Sarah bait. What? My husband is my monitor. Um... I need you to get me out of here before I snap. Oh, God, Alison, I'm so sorry. I... I can't. I'm leaving town for a while. Leaving? Where? I'm going. I'm going with Kira and Sarah. We... Look, I wanted to tell you, but it's not safe to know. Even my own clones think I'm useless. Oh, no, darling, no! You... You have a musical to focus on. I killed Aynsley, Felix. Aynsley wore a scarf in the kitchen. Hang on just one second. Hi, uncle Felix. Hey, monkey! All right, Alison, I'm really sorry, but I've got to go. No... I know, I... Felix. Look, call Cosima. Don't tip him. She'll help you. And just play possum, OK? Don't... I'm sorry, Alison. I've gotta go. I'm sorry. How is auntie Alison making out? (Pill bottle rattling) You have got enough to worry about right now, OK? Are you excited for our big adventure, monkey? I don't know. Yeah, no, it's gonna be brilliant. Absolutely. No question. I can't wait. Are we there yet? Fourteen hundred acres supporting 40 souls. God smiles on you. Well, farmers pray more than most, but... it's not worth the breath without hard work and basic biology, agro-sciences. Helena's been with you for quite some time now, hasn't she? Since she was 12 years old. I wonder, Tomas, if you've ever considered the fact that, seeing as she's the twin of a fertile clone, well, maybe, uh... Maybe Helena can... Conceive as well. Impossible. She's defective and dangerous. Any child of hers would be a monster. Well, you know her best. You know a wise man once said science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind. Einstein didn't believe in God. (shot of air) It's a brand-new day.
