 They knew I wasn't Beth from the medical tests. 
 You said our DNA was identical. 
 It is. You know, maybe it was your sunny personality that gave you away. 
 Who the hell is Maggie Chen? 
 That's the woman Beth shot. 
 Maggie helped make you. 
 Then she saw the light. 
 [Crying] Beth killed her to protect us. 
 Art, you got to see this. It's a match on the Jane Doe print. 
 Why the hell does she look like Beth? 
 Cosima: Paul... reports to Olivier, his handler. 
 You just rest and heal. 
 Dig faster. 
 Cosima's safety is at stake. 
 Well, she's not only researching her own biology, but she is aware of eight others. 
 I think he's my watcher. 
 I think that I may have spotted her real monitor. 
 You want to mess with my life? 
 I'm going to mess with yours. 
 I don't want to divorce Donnie, but I can't keep lying to him. 
 So what if we tell them? 
 Siobhan, this is Alison Hendrix. 
 What happened to you? 
 I don't know. 
 Kira! Kira, no! 
 [Horn honks, tires screech] 
 [Siren wails, horn blares] 
 [Tires screech] 
 7-year-old female struck by a vehicle. 
 GCS 3, chest injury, possible internal bleeding. 
 Stay with me, baby, please. 
 ETA: 3 minutes. 
 [Crying] We're here, love. We're right here. 
 Let's get her typed and crossed for 3 units. 
 We're right here. Please. 
 Excuse me, excuse me. 
 This is as far as you go. 
 No, no, no! 
 Sarah, Sarah. 
 [Moan] 
 We have to let them do their job. 
 On 3. 1, 2, 3! 
 I want an ultrasound and a trauma series: Chest, pelvic, C-spine. Let's get a level 1 on standby and a crash cart. We may have to intubate. 
 O.R.'s being prepped. 
 Good. 
 I should've known Helena would find us. 
 I should've stopped her. 
 I won't have you blaming yourself. 
 You did not bring this on. 
 She's going to be okay, Sarah. 
 She has to be. 
 Mm-hmm. [Sniffle] 
 Can I get anybody some coffee? 
 Alison, I know you mean well, I know you do, it's just...  
 Um, I know, I know. I'm in the way. 
 Yeah. 
 I just can't help but feel like it's my daughter in there. 
 You should go home. 
 You should get some sleep. 
 I can't go home, Felix. I...  
 I assaulted my monitor. 
 I'm going to get black-bagged like Sarah and carted off to God knows where. 
 All right, use my place, then. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 I'll call you if we hear anything. 
 Okay. 
 Ultrasound's up. 
 Heart rate's at 80. 
 BP: 85/50. 
 Doctor, you need to see this. 
 What's happening? 
 It looks like Kira's going to be okay. 
 What does "looks like" mean? 
 Well, she's been sedated, but her blood pressure and breathing have stabilized. 
 Her ribs are intact, there's no internal bleeding, no head trauma. 
 I think she's gonna be fine. 
 She was run right over. 
 I saw it. 
 Then she's a very lucky girl. 
 She's okay. 
 She's okay, she's okay, she's okay. 
 She's okay. 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Cry-laughing] 
 My baby. 
 Mummy, she looks like you. 
 She looks like mummy. 
 Shh shh shh, shh shh. 
 Just sleep now, monkey. 
 I'll keep you safe from her. 
 I promise. 
 There was a girl, a little girl. 
 Easy, child. 
 Pull yourself together. 
 Sarah is a mother. 
 That's ridiculous! 
 It's not possible. 
 The girl was hit by a car because of me. 
 Felix: She's all right? 
 Yeah, yeah, she's fast asleep. 
 How about you, then? 
 Are you thanking your lucky stars? 
 I don't believe in miracles. 
 Kids are made of rubber, Sarah. 
 She got lucky, just like the doctor said. 
 You didn't see it. 
 Count your blessings. 
 Move on to your worries. 
 Yeah, Helena's got to go. 
 I got a dozen reasons to bring Beth back in. 
 Look, we got three sets of matching prints, a jumper who looks just like her, and we got a smooth little rent-boy who's connected to them both. 
 All right, all right. I know, Angie...  
 And here, we've got Jane Doe, the one who started it all. 
 Bet you 100 bucks I know who she's looks like when Beckwith is done with the reconstruction. 
 You got no charge that'll stick yet. 
 Obstruction. This all comes on the heels of that civilian shooting. 
 So what?! 
 So she could be protecting the killer. 
 Shh shh shh shh. 
 How's it going? 
 Still pushing for a break, sir. 
 Grigson and Chow just solved that stabbing in the junction. 
 Maybe you need a fresh pair of eyes here, huh? 
 No, we're good, sir. We're good. 
 Just give us 'til the end of the day. 
 You want me to throw my ex-partner under the bus, hmm? 
 If I'm wrong about this, you'll be the last partner I ever have. 
 I don't know, Art. 
 I'm starting to wonder. 
 Does she have something on you? 
 End of day, Angie. 
 If this is true, if the child's actually hers...  
 [Breathes heavily] 
 How could you let her go? 
 She's innocent. 
 I did what I was told...  
 I used Sarah to get to the others. 
 Then where are the others?! 
 Why is Sarah still alive? 
 That man, Olivier! 
 I took off his beast-tail for you.- Yes! 
 To get Dr. Leekie's attention! 
 The child will be valuable to them. 
 [Ringtone] 
 No, no! 
 [Ring] 
 That's her! 
 [Ring] 
 Tell her to come here. 
 Tell her! 
 [Ring] 
 Helena. 
 Is Kira all right? I'll tell you in person. Where are you? It was an accident. Tell her! [Clatter] [Beep] Lovely apartment for a young couple. Ahh! [Laughs] Very convincing. Unfortunately, the lie Olivier told last night was not. What lie? Someone tampered with the security footage at club Neolution,  but I know there were two clones there  that night, weren't there? [Chuckle] I've searched for the lost clone, Helena, for years. She's my white whale, Paul! But she's feral. She couldn't fool you, impersonate Beth, under this roof, in that bed. But Sarah Manning could. Oh! [Bubbling] Oh! What the hell?! A simple "thank you" would suffice. So, Kira's going to be okay? Yes, miraculous recovery. Okay. Uh, where's my, um...  Oh, your...  drug paraphernalia is in a drawer. So is the paraphernalia that was by your bed. Did you wash that, too? My children are at my mother's house right now. I'm a danger to them. So I was thinking I could use this house as a base while I apartment-hunt. No! Well, Donnie's staying clear of the house for a few hours, so I just need to go by and get some sundries and clothing. Fine! You can stay one night. Just don't wake me on your way back in. Felix. Felix. I'm a pariah. I can't go back there alone. Mnh! I need you to be my wingman. Are you bloody serious? Please? I need to change. Fetch me something gay. [Bell tolls] Holy sh1t, Sarah. I'm so relieved. Yeah, even the doctors were stumped. Do you think, because Kira's mine, she might be different? Because she's uninjured? Yeah, it's just a question. Well, if they genetically modified us, I mean, you could've passed something down to her. Like what? I don't know. Lizards regrow limbs. Cosima, Kira's not a lizard. Right, well,  it's not magic, it's just stem cells, you know? Look, I have a guy who's sequencing the German's DNA alongside mine, to see if the illness she had was genetic. If you want, I can give him samples  of you and Kira, to compare. Yeah, I'm not giving you our genetic material. You'd probably hand it over to Delphine. Dude, I'm just doing what we agreed, okay? I'm following the science. Yeah, well, I worry about scientists more than science. [Doorbell rings] Got to go. [Sigh] Eh, I got it. Hey. Hey. Coloring books and puzzles. She's sleeping. Uh, Mrs S, this is Paul. Pleasure. Paul. She knows everything. Well, not everything, clearly. Well, don't hold it against me, but I have some bad news. Dr. Leekie knows who you are, Sarah. [Grunting] Let go! Let go! Aaaah! Aah! No! No! No! [Sobbing] I gave you everything! A reason for living and, in return... weakness. Tomas. No! [Whine] If you protect this forgery, you're no better than they are. No! Aah! You're no better than they are! [Cries out] [Sobbing] [Crying out] Leekie wants to meet? He says he wants to make a deal. He knows you're aware, in contact with each other. How? Did Cosima give me up? Look, this is an opportunity. [Sigh] You sound exactly like her. I don't trust him, either. But the genie's out of the bottle. [Sigh] For them, too.  Your interests have aligned. You can get answers. Or I could get black-bagged and abducted. What if there was a way to meet him safely, on your terms? Over 4,000 base pairs from each sample, sequenced and analyzed. Awesome! Awesome. Okay, what did you find? No markers for respiratory disease. This sequence is anomalous for cytochrome C and then this piece is distinct in each sample. They're different? That's... that's crazy. What are you looking for, really? Not respiratory disease. Nope. Hey. Hey! Hey. Scott, this is Delphine. Hello. Hey. [Chuckle] I have to run to class, but I was wondering if I could come over later. Yeah, of course. Okay. Oof! Wow! Okay! Bye. Bye. If she wakes up, just tell her I'm going to be right back. And will you? Yeah. Are you going to be okay here? Don't you worry about Helena. Your shotgun. Forgot about that. One of the great things about this country...  hunting's not just for the rich. [Ring] [Ring] Kind of busy, here, Art. Pilates can wait, Beth. We need to talk. We already did that. Off the record, this time. No one else. This is your last chance. Where are you? You know I get crow's feet if I don't get enough shuteye. I will have you back on your couch in a jiff. Oh, my God! Alison. Wh... what's going on? What is this? We're gathered in a spirit of love and understanding. Please, join us. An intervention? This is bullshit! Hello! Felix. Gay friend. Acting coach. Oh, that's perfectly fine here. Which one? Yes, yes. Please join us. Alison, your friends have shown great strength in setting aside their pain and hurt in order to talk with you today. Mm-hmm. Um, Donnie, why don't you go ahead and get us started. Uh...  Yeah. Alison, the pills...  and the drinking, it has to stop. I don't think you know how hard this has been for me. The constant criticism, the abuse. You can be specific, Donnie. You hit me with a golf club. You burned my chest with hot glue. It still hurts in the shower, Alison. Donnie...  Alison, it's actually important for you to just try and listen right now. Aynsley? Alison, you took advantage of my husband and may have ruined my marriage, too. You threatened and assaulted me. But I think what really hurts is that you turned your back on our friendship. Donnie, tell her that we...  Mom! It's not just about you and me, Alison. It's about our kids. Do you really want to break up our family? [Crying] Alison. I have 2 minutes. 2 minutes? That's all I get, for 2 years by your side? 
 
 Who's that? Felix Dawkins. Your lookalike, Sarah Manning's, foster brother. Yeah, and? You visited his place a few weeks back with 75 grand in your trunk, the day I stopped you from skipping town. It's all coming back to the Maggie Chen shooting. You don't want to go there, Art. You put the phone in Maggie Chen's hand. You helped me make it look like it was an accident. I was trying to help my partner. This is your last chance to come clean with me, Beth. We do what we gotta do. [Shouting] Sarah, you were right. I was wrong. Okay, what have you done with Cosima? Because this definitely isn't her. Ha ha. Okay, listen...  they can tell us apart by our DNA. That's how they knew you weren't Beth. So we're not genetically identical? We should be,  but there's a synthetic sequence. I don't know what it is, exactly, but it's like a barcode, maybe,  maybe a way to differentiate us? Well, that explains He knows who you are? Yeah, and he knows we're in contact. Did you say something to Delphine? No. Sarah, no. I...  'Cause they're one step closer to Kira. Uh...  Okay, I would never say anything about you or Kira. You are the first one of us to ever even have a child. I mean, there's not even taxonomy for the offspring of a clone. Well, either way, you got what you wanted, 'cause I'm about to meet Leekie. Really? Just give him a chance. You might be surprised. They care about us. They... they have to. Yeah, I was thinking of putting a gun to his head. Paul: Sorry for the precautions. No no, I understand completely. Hello, Sarah. Dr. Leekie. You've gleaned how this works. There are many questions I can't answer. That's not good enough. I understand your frustration, but, like Olivier or Paul, I only know my part. So, what is your part? I oversee data collection and quantify your well-being. I...  I look after you. Not me. No. Mnh-mnh. Somehow, you got away. Jesus Christ. Just tell me why! What is this all about? We can go further, Sarah, much further, but we need to come to an agreement on something crucial. Helena. A common enemy, obviously. Olivier said she mentioned Tomas. Who's that? Great question,  and one I can answer. Tomas opposes us. Science, in general. They're religious extremists. Proletheans, they call themselves. Right, "Neolutionist" is way better. [Chuckle] Years ago, one of their agents infiltrated our project. Maggie Chen, the woman Beth shot. Yes. She and Tomas found Helena in a convent, then trained a clone to kill clones. [Chuckle] Brilliant, really. That's brilliant, really. So, what, you want me to kill her? No, we don't want to harm her at all. We want you to bring her in so we can deprogram her, get her the help she needs. You do this, and we can move forward with a new understanding. You and your friends will be free to live as you choose, no monitors. Oh, you're going to give us lives? You've always had lives. They haven't been directed, just observed. Except in your case. And Helena's. Helena's been under their care, which is far, far worse than ours. Bring her in. We'll get her the help she needs. [Knock-knock] Bonsoir, ma chérie. I have the truffles that I promised you. Are you okay? Are you? Well, I was, but...  Delphine Cormier, not Beraud. You've already got your doctorate in immunology, don't you? I am...  so sorry. I'm so stupid. No, no, no, you're not. You knew this all along. Yeah, that transcript you accidentally left behind, your fake boyfriend in Paris, pretending you didn't know who Dr. Leekie was. I knew it was bullshit, but I still thought you were on my side. I wanted to trust you. You can trust me. You told Leekie I know these girls! I had to! Look at me. He says you're in danger. Of what?! You don't know, do you? No. Then you're the real danger, Delphine. [Knock at door] Alison, you're only making things worse. [Crying] I only want to talk to Felix. This is all Aynsley. She put them up to this. It's all part of the experiment. Yes, how do clones react when ritually humiliated by friends and loved ones? Fascinating. Hey! Sharesies? [Chuckle] Maybe it's not just Aynsley. Maybe they're all monitors. The reverend seems all right. Actually, he's kind of sexy. Man of the cloth, and all that. Felix, what am I going to do? Put your chin up. Be a woman. This is backstabbing 101. I cannot go back out there. Of course you can. You're going to face the music, eat some humble pie, hug it out, play opossum. Aynsley's going to think she's won and you are going to live to fight another day. [Chuckle] Mm-hmm. Oh, lord. Can you help me get my face on? With pleasure. [Grunting] [Ringtone] [Ring] [Ring] Helena still won't answer. What do you plan to do, turn her over to Leekie? I don't know. I don't know what he's really going to do with her, do I? Does that matter? She came after your daughter. Yeah, my gut says put a bullet in her myself, but, you don't understand what it's like. I look at Helena and I see me. You don't owe her anything, Sarah. I, um...  I got in touch with my people back in England, about where you're really from. And? They said they'd get back to me, but, they're scared, as if something is going on over there, too. Please, Cosima. Where are you going? Why, so you can tell Leekie? I'm such an idiot! [Sniffle] What else did you tell him? Nothing! Just the seven names. Nothing about Kira. She's an anomaly. You know that? Delphine, you can use me, that's fine, but don't go near that little girl. I didn't and I won't! Get out! Please listen to me. Just let me tell you this one thing. Just listen to me. I didn't want to fall for you. I wasn't supposed to. But I have. How can I possibly believe that, Delphine? Because you feel it! Ugh! This is not... it's not a lie. It's not possible. You know, I've never been with a woman before. Yeah, it showed. [Sigh] [Sobbing] The 23rd, right? Yeah, east platform, north end. I was on the other side, fixing a derailer. That's her. What a shame. That's Beth. And then this other lady walks up. Man: That'd be your jumper. Wait, wait. Rewind that. Right... stop, right there. sh1t. I never saw it from this angle. [Ring, buzz] [Ring, buzz] [Ring, buzz] Helena. Sarah! [Shuddering] You're the only one I can really turn to. How do you know it's not a trap? She was convincing. It is a trap. But now you know where she is, just give her to Leekie. I'd have to agree with him, at this point. And then what? Then we're partners with Leekie and then he's going to find out about Kira. Tsk. Sarah...  I don't know how I'm going to play this, okay? Just... just give me a minute. Hey, you're awake. How do you feel? Tired. Yeah. You had a big crash, but you're going to be just fine. It wasn't Helena's fault. What? I went outside to play with her. She tell you to say this? No. She's dangerous. She's sick in the head and it makes her want to hurt us. She just needs your help. I'm sorry, Kira. I don't think anybody can help Helena now. Meera: Alison, I saw you in that van with Chad. My children saw you. Aynsley: I just wish you could understand how much damage you've caused. I mean, we all trusted you. Aynsley, you brought us here today, didn't you? I care about you, sweetie. You called all these people and told them everything. I'm doing this to help you. And I thank you. For scrutinizing every detail of my life since the day I moved into this fishbowl. You have pried and snooped and gossiped about me like I was your own, personal laboratory subject. How would you like it  if I turned your life inside out? If I told all these people that Chad, your husband, slept with the spin-class instructor, long before me. Well maybe he acts that way  because you blew the roofer at the cabin! Wow! Okay, um... Alison, you see...  No! No more words! She's right. This has gone far enough. Mom, everybody, out, now! Let's go. This was your olive branch and you torched it! [Singsong] Huge mistake. [Door slams] That went very well. I think it went well. Yeah. You came. How is Kira? You're never going to see her again. I would never hurt her. I wish I could believe you. Do it. sh1t! [Crying] You care! No, I don't. Stay back! Don't try any sh1t! You are all I have now. [Crying] I love you. You must be Sarah. You can't harm her kid! Harm her? No, never. The child is innocent. You are the light, Helena. You're the original. You know what that means? The child is rightfully your daughter. He's lying! Helena, Helena. There's no original. I told you... we're the same. Neither of us is the original. Put her down! We'll bring the child home to her real mother. Helena! Helena. Look, look...  you know that connection you feel? [Crying] I feel it, too. It's us. She'll say anything to save herself. He locked you in a cage! He lied to you your entire life! He's going to do that to Kira. He's going to hurt Kira, like he hurt you. You made me this way. Helena. Agh! Aagghh! [Moaning] I know what you are. Yeah, I'm the one with the keys. Maybe I'll give 'em to Dr. Leekie. [Groaning] Come on. [Pounding, grunting] Sarah! Sarah! [Ring] S? Sarah, where are you? I'm about to give Helena to Leekie. He knows who I am. He's going to find out  about Kira, sooner or later. You can't. You need to get back here, right away. With Helena. [Pounding] What? Why? I'll explain when you get here. [Pounding] [Plaintively] Sarah! You wanted to see me? Yeah. It's about Beth Childs. I'm sorry. She said she'd be here. Yes. They didn't show. Blood is thicker than you think, Aldous. Jesus Christ! How long has Art been sitting on this? Just a couple of days, sir. Really, Angie? You said by the end of the day. We're getting an arrest warrant for Beth Childs. Lieutenant, Beth's dead. You need a warrant for Sarah Manning. Where's Helena? I tied her up in the trunk. What's going on? Sarah, this is Amelia. Hi. Look at you. Sarah. I'm your birth mother. Yeah, I'm not what you expected, I'm sure. I kind of gave up expecting. I'm sorry to arrive like this, but, when word came you were looking for me, I had to leave cape town in a hurry. I was being watched, you see. After all this time, they...  they found me again. I was only 22, in a new country. A wealthy couple asked me to be their in-vitro surrogate. They paid me, provided a flat in London, a legal arrangement. But something was off. The medical tests were excessive and I overheard the couple talking with the doctors, about a child unfettered by tradition, an advanced...  evolution, of some kind. Neolution? Yeah, but they weren't a couple at all. They were scientists. The child I carried wasn't meant for them. I realized the life inside of me was in danger, so I ran, I hid, and gave birth to the two of you in secret. The two of us? Yeah, I had twins. I knew I couldn't keep you, so I hid you away...  one to the state and one to the church. Helena. Who do you work for? I need to see you privately. I have something for you. Mind Amelia. Why? I found a known associate. Isn't this place off-limits to you guys? Yes? Alison! Cosima! Art: Sarah Manning! Come out with your hands up! Come out, now!
