 Alison, help! 
 I killed Aynsley, Felix. 
 I thought it was her. My husband is my monitor. 
 (Coughing) I'm sick, Delphine. 
 I'm willing to disregard Rachel and proceed with the treatment. 
 They're not clone cells. 
 They're from a totally different person. Whoever you cloned, do they have a niece or even a daughter? 
 I didn't think your mom had any sisters. 
 They all look the same, but I can tell them apart. 
 (Moaning in pain) He took my finger. 
 This is piss-off money, okay? You don't get to know anything. 
 (Screaming) You're the one that meets me in the parking lot. 
 I have to make these, uh, place settings for Family Day. 
 I could use some help. 
 I'll get you your dirt on Alison Hendrix. 
 But my charges go when I'm done. 
 Six died incinerated in a lab explosion. 
 Susan and Ethan Duncan... They were Rachel's parents. 
 If you think you're gonna take Duncan back, then you'll have to kill us both. 
 Leekie wouldn't let us raise her. He killed Rachel's mother. 
 My neighbour Aynsley always thought she was better than me. 
 Yeah, it's tough, the judgment. 
 Yes! And it wasn't, you know, outright. 
 It was just these little jabs and looks. 
 I hate people like that. 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. 
 I guess, you know, in that sense she had it coming. 
 Had what coming? 
 (TV playing in the background) 
 Oh, just an incident. 
 Come on, Ali. Unburden yourself. 
 That's why we're here. 
 No, I can't. 
 Hey. Look at me. 
 You can trust me. The stuff that I've done... 
 No judgment. 
 (TV in the background) 
 I slept with her husband. 
 In a parking lot. 
 Do you think I'm awful? 
 No, I think you're brave. 
 Alison, you're brave for sharing. 
 Feels nice, feels good, no? 
 Yeah. 
 You know, the next step is, you have to learn to forgive... that I killed her. 
 Well, she was choking and I didn't stop it. 
 What, like on a piece of chicken? 
 No. Not like on a piece of chicken. 
 I could have saved her, and I didn't. 
 (Whispering) She clawed at the countertop... begging for her life. 
 I stood there, until it was over. 
 (Sighing) 
 It feels so good to say it out loud. 
 Yeah, I bet. 
 You have been so supportive. 
 I made something. 
 Oh, it's for me? 
 Yeah. Who else? 
 (Gasping in disgust) 
 (Birdsong) 
 Oi! Mr. Duncan. 
 Is this it? 
 No. No, I told you. Red box, no label. 
 We simply cannot leave without it. 
 (Sighing) He's mad, Siobhan. 
 He's afraid we'll side with Leekie. 
 (Sighing again) 
 Maybe we'll side with Rachel. 
 After what she's done? Rachel is a creature of DYAD. 
 She may know full well that Leekie killed her mother. She might even approve. 
 No, she had those videos of them. 
 That doesn't mean anything. 
 I don't know how we use him yet but I say we divide and conquer. 
 That's a good enough strategy, isn't it? 
 Might be. With more facts. 
 Aha! 
 Did you find it? 
 No. This. 
 (Sighing in relief) 
 (Moaning in disgust) 
 (Mumbling to herself) 
 Oh. 
 (Background chatter) 
 I got, uh, I got something big for you. 
 No, I'll tell you in person. 
 Listen, DeAngelis, this is not a negotiation. 
 You want Alison Hendrix, you show up tomorrow with my paperwork. 
 After I see my charges have been dropped, then I'll talk. 
 I don't give a sh1t what you think. 
 (Theme music) 
 (Moaning in her sleep) 
 Mommy... 
 Shh. Shh. 
 It's okay, Kira. 
 (Sighing) 
 sh1t. 
 (Birdsong) 
 (Screaming in disgust) 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, bloody hell! 
 Aha! 
 There it is. 
 What? 
 (Short laugh) That's just junk. 
 What, is that it? That's what we've been looking for? 
 Thank you! 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Hey, is Kira all right? 
 Yeah, she's fine. 
 But they're on to me. 
 What? 
 How? 
 Computer's been hacked. 
 Which means they could have my location. 
 But I'll throw 'em off the trail. 
 sh1t! I'm... I'm coming for her. 
 No, no, I'm on the move. 
 I'll call you at the meet-up spot. 
 Are you gonna tell me who your mystery sitter is? 
 No. 
 I'm not. 
 I'll trust you know what's best for Kira if you will trust me with him. 
 I don't. 
 Not by a long shot. He's still my responsibility. 
 Just, let me get him to town we'll take it from there. 
 Hey. 
 (Birdsong) Watch your back with this one. 
 Come on. 
 We have to go. 
 Can you feel that? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Feel that? 
 Kinda. 
 Yeah? 
 And that? (Monitor beeping) 
 The spinal's working. 
 We're gonna begin. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 She's inserting into the uterus and she's gonna inject directly into the muscles. 
 This is the beginning of getting you well, Cosima. 
 Okay? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Huh? 
 God. Jesus Christ. 
 What the f... 
 (Phone still ringing) 
 Oh, wait. 
 What? 
 Felix, we have a problem. 
 What? Why are you whispering? 
 Because I'm not supposed to be using the telephone. Vic is here. 
 Vic is in rehab? 
 Yes. 
 And he's snitching to a cop called DeAngelis. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Angela DeAngelis? 
 I can't go to jail, Felix. 
 I don't have the temperament. In the shower if they touch me... 
 Alison. Alison! 
 Look, I will be there first thing. 
 All right? 
 Okay. 
 Hey, where's Kira? 
 Uh, she's sleeping. 
 Did anyone follow ya? 
 No, I took the side streets and doubled back. 
 All right, I'm so sorry about this. I don't know how they found me in the first place. 
 I encrypted everything. I routed all my traffic through anonymous proxies. 
 I mean, I'm untraceable. 
 It wasn't your fault. 
 They're trying hard. 
 That tells me Kira's quite the prize for 'em. 
 Listen, I have no idea who these "aunties" are, but they came with a weird story. 
 She's just got an overactive imagination, Cal. 
 You sure? 
 Yes. 
 Well, hi. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Cal. 
 Sarah. 
 Wanna come in? 
 I'm not that kinda girl. 
 (Cal laughing) 
 Yes, you are. 
 Sarah and Helena were separated. 
 How? 
 By a Prolethean. 
 Mark Rollins. Known to us. 
 And then? 
 I followed Sarah, as instructed, and she came up empty. 
 No sign of the scientist? 
 None. 
 You know what this is? 
 Synthetic amniotic fluid. 
 We're developing an artificial womb. 
 A bit of a hobby of mine. 
 I like pottery. 
 What have you told Rachel? 
 I came to you first. What should I tell her? 
 (Chuckling) What you told me, Paul. 
 The truth. 
 Thank you. 
 (Beep) 
 Yes, Dr. Leekie? 
 I need to meet with Marian Bowles. 
 It's an emergency. 
 (Birdsong) 
 We really must go now. 
 It's time. 
 Right then. 
 (Birdsong) 
 Y... your box. 
 Hmm? 
 Your mementos. 
 Ah, yes. 
 We really do have to go. Wh... what? 
 What have we there? 
 Everything, Ms. Sadler. 
 Absolutely everything. 
 (Gulls crying) 
 (Soft music) 
 Mommy. 
 Morning, monkey. 
 Mommy. 
 We share a lab. 
 Why do we have to keep the source from her? 
 Because you signed a confidentiality agreement. 
 And I'm your boss. Is that clear? 
 (Scott sighing) 
 Cosima... 
 What's going on, Scott? 
 Um... 
 You gave me Kira's stem cells? 
 Please, listen to me. Leekie set us up. 
 Us? 
 What? 
 Yes, remember the culture we stumbled upon? The match? 
 He planted it for us to find. 
 You knew it was Kira's! 
 But only after I realized that it was working! 
 The tests were positive and I had to keep going. 
 Did you ever stop to think once that this is my decision and not yours? 
 There is no decision, Cosima. You have one way forward and this is it. 
 How did you harvest her? 
 Kira lost a tooth in her accident and Leekie procured it from the hospital. 
 It is a finite source. 
 Unless you bring her in for more. 
 Yeah. 
 Out. 
 You don't understand. 
 This is my lab. 
 My body! I'm the science. Get out! 
 (Door opening) 
 (and closing shut) 
 (Exhaling) 
 Whoa. Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Could I talk to you for a second? 
 (Exhaling) 
 Yeah, sure. What's up? 
 Privately. 
 Hey, Ali. 
 You ready for Family Day? 
 Absolutely. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So, what's on your mind? 
 You selfish, manure bag of a man! 
 What's this? 
 You were supposed to come to rehab to heal and to grow. 
 You're not supposed to come to get even sleazier. I opened up to you, Vic. I trusted you. 
 Alison. 
 I'm honestly sorry. I got a past I'm trying to get out from under. 
 I have to meet DeAngelis this afternoon. 
 And what would your dealer friends say about Squeally Vic? 
 I'm moving forward, and if you knew what was good for you, you'd do the same. 
 Starting by removing the, uh, unsavory elements from your life. 
 Sarah's not pleased. 
 (Door squeaking) 
 Sarah? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 She here? 
 She's nearby. 
 Aldous. 
 Marian. 
 (Marian chuckling) 
 Oh, please tell me your hands have not been soaking in some gruesomely fecund jelly. 
 (Both laughing) 
 What I do with my free time is my business, Marian. Please. 
 Ethan Duncan is alive. 
 How? 
 I don't know. But Sarah Manning tracked him down. 
 Well... 
 (Chuckling) This is a thing. 
 It's a thing. 
 Well, you know Rachel better than anyone. 
 How do you think she's react when she learns the truth? 
 At one time, I'd have counted on her to see the big picture. 
 And now? 
 She's taking things personally. 
 If Rachel has become too entangled... we have to step in. 
 She will fight. 
 Then she will lose. 
 You know, I was just thinking. 
 Our paths rarely cross anymore. 
 My misfortune. 
 But when they do, it's almost always because of Sarah Manning. 
 We need to look at that. Done? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (Background chatter) 
 So, look, I've been... 
 I've been working on something for the past few days. 
 I think I might have the answer for us. 
 Okay. 
 Reykjavik. 
 What was the question? 
 I'm serious. 
 I have people there. 
 Ay. 
 Who's got people in Iceland? 
 I can get the paperwork. 
 I got money. Just say yes. 
 Cal, it's not that easy. 
 All right, right on cue! 
 The vague warnings. 
 Look, there are other people involved. 
 (Background chatter) 
 You know I've tangled with corporate heavies before. 
 Yeah, not like these. 
 I know. Point is, I made some friends along the way. 
 I got contacts, sources. 
 Some of them are tinfoil-hat guys. 
 But the chatter about the DYAD Group, it's... 
 What? Hey. 
 Listen. We're just gonna do it. 
 We're just gonna say it out loud, okay? Your big secret. 
 Sarah Manning, I know this may sound crazy, but I think you're a... a Pisces. 
 Am I right? 
 You twat. 
 It makes so much sense to me. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Whatever it is, I don't care. 
 Let's just get outta here. 
 (Gulls crying) 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Yeah? 
 Hey, Sarah. Look. 
 We need your help with a little something at rehab. 
 What's Alison done? 
 She hurled herself off the wagon? 
 No, she... 
 I... I am sober as a judge, Sarah. 
 It's you. Your people. 
 Your finks and rats and snitches and fuzz. 
 Vic's here and he's gonna give me up to the police unless you meet with him. 
 I need you to come here right now and clean up your doo-doo. 
 (Sighing) 
 ♪ I feel it in my fingers ♪

 (Low voice) Come on, come on! 
 Oi. 
 Oi.

 Welcoming her family. 
 It's some kind of public flagellation day. Follow me.

♪ Come on and let it show ♪ 
 Hi. 
 Hi. I'm here. What? 
 What do you want? (Exhaling) 
 Victor. You have the floor. 
 (Victor sighing) 
 I have to atone. 
 "Dear Sarah..." 
 "You are a rock in my stream." 
 "Blocking the flow." 
 I'm not getting it, Vic. 
 I have to apologize. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Good! Yeah. Fine. 
 Accepted. 
 Wait, I haven't done it yet. 
 Uh, I atone you, Vic. 
 You're atoned. Okay? 
 Okay? We're done? 
 Cool. Thank you. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Sarah, you don't have anything you want to say to me? 
 After everything? Come on, the heartbreak, the finger loss. 
 Pff! 
 Oh, you want me to apologize to you? 
 Which of the 12 Steps is that? 
 Sarah, I want a conversation with you, back and forth. 
 No. No, Vic. We had a deal. 
 You get to say your bit to Sarah and then you stay buttoned up re Alison's little bouts of criminal negligence. 
 That was not the deal. 
 New deal. 
 
 
 
 (Background chatter) 
 Mom! 
 Babies! 
 Hello! Hello! 
 I missed you so much, my little babies! 
 Daddy says you're coming home soon. 
 Yes, I am. 
 Soon as daddy deems me fit. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Come on. Today's gonna be good. All right? 
 Nothing to worry about. 
 Hey, let's go. 
 Can you find your nametag on the table? 
 Oh! - Oh, look at that! 
 Where's my nametag? 
 Look at that! That is exciting! 
 They did that for you. 
 Honey, can you pass my nametag? 
 You know who made them? 
 Honey, can you pass my nametag? 
 You. 
 Relax! 
 Sarah, you always do this! 
 You always keep yourself at a distance. You never let me in. 
 No wonder, with those giant banana hands of yours. 
 For the love of Buddha, can you please stay out of this? 
 Listen, listen. Hey, Vic! 
 Look, I apologize. 
 'Kay. 
 Really, truly. We were two colliding train wrecks. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay? 
 Sarah, I've been doing a lot of the work. 
 Great. Yeah, that's good. 
 I'm getting a lot better. 
 Good for you. 
 Thank you. 
 Good luck. 
 (Low voice) I want you back. 
 Oh, dear God. 
 Piss off Vic. 
 Listen, I've changed. 
 All right? Let me prove it to you. 
 Not happening, it's not happening. 
 What? 
 Don't tell me that Nail Gun Ken is still in the picture. 
 No, but you should see the new one. 
 There's a new one. 
 Felix. 
 What? 
 Those guys are not you. I am you. 
 I stand for... 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Okay. Look. 
 (Short laugh) What I'm trying to say is this. 
 (Sighing) 
 Do you smell salt? 
 Whoa! 
 What the hell just happened? 
 I may have spiked his tea. 
 If you've done your homework, I shouldn't have to introduce myself. 
 Siobhan Sadler. 
 I have to say, I'm pretty impressed you'd come here. 
 I have something you want. 
 My favorite kind of visitor. 
 Please. 
 (Door opening) 
 Have a seat. 
 I have the early research of Professors Susan and Ethan Duncan. 
 Key formulas. Methodology. Sequences. 
 A summary, on disc. 
 Where'd you get it? 
 (Short laugh) 
 It's your missing science, Dr. Leekie. 
 What is it worth to you? 
 Well, that depends. 
 I'd need to authenticate it. 
 With Duncan himself. 
 I give you Duncan. You give up on Kira. 
 And we disappear once and for all. You drop your hunt. 
 What about Sarah? 
 Sarah sadly insists on fending for herself. 
 But the child deserves better. 
 Ugh! It's like he was molested by elves. 
 What did you give him? 
 Benzodiazepine. 
 In small doses, it's perfectly recreational. 
 It's true. 
 Sorry. 
 God! He weighs a ton. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 S. What's wrong? 
 Nothing, for once. I was fact-checking. 
 Seems safe to assume Rachel doesn't know Leekie killed her mother. 
 What? How do you know that? 
 He told me, in not so many words. 
 He does want Duncan silent and all the science to himself. 
 What, you talked to Leekie? 
 Divide and conquer, Sarah. 
 But if we drop this bomb on Rachel, there's no telling which one of them will fall. 
 I'm good with either one. 
 Let's blow up their sh1t. 
 Then I'll set it up. 
 (Knocking at the door) 
 Alison? 
 What the hell? 
 (Moaning in effort) 
 I, uh... Yep. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What' you doing ducking out? You volunteered. 
 Uh, I know. 
 Okay, come on. 
 (Background chatter) Alison. 
 Do I have to drag you out of there? Alison! 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Coming. 
 (Sighing and mumbling) 
 Have you seen Victor? 
 Nope. 
 Great. 
 (Background chatter) 
 (Moaning in effort) Oh, my God. 
 What is this? Wh... 
 You're welcome. 
 Thanks to me, he's gonna miss his meeting with DeAngelis. 
 No, no, no! He can't be here. 
 There's family tours after the assembly. 
 They're coming to this room! 
 Oh bollocks. 
 Oh... 
 (Suspense music) 
 (Background chatter) 
 So we're all gonna be nice to mommy, right? Okay? 
 (Sighing) Come on. 
 Hello, everyone! Okay! 
 Well, hello. Please take your seats. We'll get started now. 
 Great to see all shining faces here today. 
 Oh, Alison. We have a seat in front. 
 Front row. Come on. 
 Welcome to our Family Day. 
 Ali! 
 As is the custom on Family Day, the group has chosen a resident to make some opening remarks. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, Alison Hendrix! 
 (Applause) 
 Oh, sh1t... 
 Hey, mom! 
 Hello, kids. Okay. 
 Thank you all for coming today. 
 Not that any of us really had any choice, I guess. 
 (A few laughs) 
 So, um, we stand among you today, pill poppers and booze hounds, hop-heads, tweakers, rummies... 
 Alison. 
 Right. 
 (Background chatter) 
 (Felix mumbling angrily) 
 Come on. We need to get him downstairs. 
 Trust me, I have a plan. 
 Christ on a log! The man's made of cement. 
 Hurry up, Felix. I need to make it to the assembly for the role-playing demonstration. 
 The what?! 
 Role-playing. 
 Let's begin. 
 Okay. 
 Hello, everyone. 
 Oh, he's being Alison. 
 That's right. 
 And I'm being Alison being Donnie? 
 Uh, this teaches you to see things from your partner's point of view. 
 So, Donnie, what's on your mind? 
 Um, uh... 
 Don't stammer, Donnie. And stand up straight. 
 Or I'll withhold affection. 
 (Crowd laughing) 
 Engage him, Alison. 
 Make eye contact. 
 Donnie, look at me. 
 Yeah. 
 Alison, I think you should come home to your family. 
 No, Donnie, because I, Alison, need supervision. 
 That sounds about right. 
 Uh, I'm Donnie and I like to spy on my wife and monitor her every move. 
 Now, wait a minute. You're just using my voice for your words. 
 Well, maybe you should listen to Alison's words a little more often, Donnie. 
 Okay, is she doing this right? 
 You do seem to be blocking, Alison. 
 No, he's the one who's blocking... her. Her. 
 Shhh... It's what you do. 
 Now who are you being? 
 (Crowd whispering) 
 I really have to tinkle. 
 (Background chatter) 
 (Whispering) Oh. Go back. Back. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 sh1t. It's her. Get his phone. Get his phone. 
 Vic? 
 (Phone ringing in background) 
 (Door closing shut) 
 (Beep) 
 Pff. Quit screwing around, Vic. 
 What were you thinking? How could you go in there? 
 Sweet Jesus, I'm done. 
 I didn't have a choice. 
 Did I? Where's Vic? 
 Sorted. 
 For now. 
 This is a disaster. 
 Give me that. 
 Ah. Piss off. 
 Alison? 
 Wha... 
 Yes. Relax, Donnie. 
 It's Sarah Manning. The runaway clone. So... 
 I guess you'll be running off to call Dr. Leekie, hmm? 
 Clone? 
 I don't think he knows, Alison. 
 Of course he knows. He's a monitor. 
 No, darling. I think Sarah's right. This kind of cluelessness can't be faked. 
 Vic, I don't know what kind of game you're playing, but you better call me... now. 
 (Over paging system)  On-duty nurse, please come to the reception area. 
 (Suspense music) 
 (Sighing) You can't be serious. 
 Must have been the pressure of Family Day. 
 Hello, Paul. 
 Do come in. 
 You have 15 minutes. 
 Once you've gone, your father will remain here. 
 If anybody moves against this house, I will put a bullet in his head. 
 Are we clear? 
 (Soft piano music) 
 Rachel. 
 My dear, dear Rachel... 
 Hello, father. 
 I can hardly believe it's been 20 years. 
 So how is Dr. Leekie? 
 He's making his own moves, I'm sure. 
 You don't know the truth about your mother, do you? 
 What Rachel's gonna learn is gonna force both of their hands. 
 I can see where Sarah gets it. 
 Her knack for burning things down. 
 (Rachel sniffling) 
 Please forgive me. 
 You have to believe me. I had no idea. 
 What did you think you were doing? 
 You remember Sociology 201? 
 With that prof... 
 What's his name? With the cleft palate. 
 He recruited me into a study. 
 A study? 
 Long-term social metrics. 
 They told me it was totally benign but... the subjects had to remain completely unaware. 
 So when men came in vanloads at night with their gloves and their probes, was that benign? 
 What? What... what men? 
 You destroyed us, Donnie, with the spying and the lies. 
 I loved you so much, and you ruined our family! 
 And you're so stupid, you don't even know why! 
 (Traffic sounds) 
 (Short laugh) 
 My father sends his regards. 
 It's important you think very carefully about your next steps, Rachel. 
 Or what? 
 I'll die in a fire? 
 Ethan and Susan Duncan left us no choice. 
 Oh please. By salting your petri dishes? 
 Yes. They set the science back decades. 
 When they tried to run away with you... 
 I intervened. 
 Your task now is to put it behind you. 
 And do not fight. 
 It won't end well for you. 
 It's already over, Aldous. 
 (Beep) 
 (Phone ringing) 
 (Sighing) Rachel, is it done? 
 It's in motion. 
 Not a happy task, I know. 
 He was your mentor. 
 Yes, he was. 
 But he lost his way with Sarah Manning. Serves us right, really, putting a lab coat in the big chair. 
 Let me know when it's done, yep? 
 (Beep) 
 Rachel... 
 Go now. 
 No, Rachel. 
 Don't get in your car. Don't go home. 
 You might survive. 
 Thank you. 
 It's foolish to spare you. 
 But you raised me. 
 Nurture prevails. 
 (Leekie sniffling) 
 (Car engine starting) 
 (Phone ringing) 
 (Ringing at the other end) 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Sarah. 
 Hey, Cos. What's... what's going on? 
 I really hate to make this call. 
 But it's about all of us. 
 And it's about Kira. 
 (Cal): But why did she need Kira's tooth? 
 Cal... 
 What the hell? 
 I don't know. She's sick, Cal. 
 This is one of the "aunts" you won't tell me about? 
 Yes, yes. 
 We've been running from DYAD and now you want to take Kira in to have them what? 
 Harvest her? 
 I don't know, Cal! Okay? She's sick. 
 This might be her only chance. 
 Don't do this to our kid. 
 (Door banging and Kira screaming) 
 Kira? 
 Will this help? 
 Oh God, monkey. 
 sh1t. 
 It was already loose. 
 Whatever this is, it's gonna swallow you both. 
 Oh, Kira... 
 It's not your decision. We have to go back. 
 Let's get this... 
 The number we practiced... You still remember it? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, good. 
 You call it any time, okay? You need me, I'll be there. 
 No matter what. 
 Okay. 
 (Soft music) 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't worry. 
 Okay, see ya. See ya. 
 Taxi! Taxi! Hey! Hey! 
 Come on! God... 
 Dr. Leekie, I need a word. 
 (Chuckling) 
 Another time, Donnie. 
 (Honking once) 
 Get in. 
 Jesus... 
 You lied to me. 
 No. 
 I offered you a chance to be part of something special. 
 Well, it's not right. All the secrets. 
 Donnie... 
 It's late. 
 You came into my house...
