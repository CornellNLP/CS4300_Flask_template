 We're clones. 
 We're someone's experiment and they're killing us off! 
 Alison: We're like lab rats in an illegal experiment. 
 Sarah, where was Paul during all this? 
 We think Beth was spying on him. 
 Maybe it's time to check out where Paul works. 
 We need to talk about Beth. 
 You understand your role as monitor is not to interfere. 
 Paul followed me straight to Kira. 
 You're in microbiology, too? 
 Delphine. 
 Cosima. 
 Enchanté. 
 I may be sleeping with my spy as well. 
 Donnie, what's in the box?! 
 I'm entitled to a little privacy. 
 Alison, stop it! 
 "Big Boob Blowies"?! 
 If anything else comes up, I'll let you know. 
 Surveillance, please. 
 Clerk: They call it "the nanny cam". 
 Sarah, I thought you were dead! Aaah! 
 I'll get you your money, man. Aaah! 
 Pouchy took my finger. 
 You want that money? Take it and go, now. 
 Where is Beth? 
 She killed herself. 
 I took her identity. 
 You're her monitor, aren't you? Doctors came and medically examined her in her sleep. 
 Just tell me why. 
 They don't tell us why. 
 [ Snoring ] 
 [ Alert beeps ] 
 Ridiculous! God! 
 [ Clatter ] 
 I got to do everything around here? 
 Three hours to go, and the dishes still haven't been washed, the drink cart hasn't been loaded up, the kids' gift bags haven't been sorted, and did we even get ice? 
 Hello, did we get ice? 
 Alison, come on! 
 Get with the program, here. 
 We need to get moving. 
 Where did you go in the middle of the night, Donnie? 
 Uh, I don't know, Never Never Land? 
 I woke up. You weren't in bed. 
 Honey, we don't have time for this. 
 The kids are outside, doing God knows what, we got a million things to do, and you're not helping! 
 Just make a list of what we need and I'll do it when I'm out getting the damn ice. 
 I need to know where you went, Donnie. 
 Look, I know we had a bad day yesterday. 
 A bad day? 
 Is that what you call it? 
 Where are you going? 
 I'm going out to get the stuff that you were supposed to get yesterday! 
 I'm trying to have a conversation with you, Donnie. 
 And, oh, what a joy it is. 
 Don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll talk about is later. It's all good. 
 Uh.

 Orphan Black 01x06 
 Variations Under Domestication 
 Original Air Date May 4, 2013 
 Paul: My problems didn't start in the military. 
 They started out of uniform, as a private contractor. 
 Understand? 
 I'm not doing any of this by choice. 
 Right, so, they forced you to be Beth's monitor for two years, without ever knowing why. 
 You're some kind of hustler. 
 You understand leverage, right? 
 The difference is, you chose to infiltrate Beth's life, to screw her boyfriend, right on this counter. 
 And you weren't even you. 
 And you weren't you, either. 
 I don't think you understand how serious this is. 
 We need to try and be honest with each other, twin sister. 
 Okay. 
 So what happens to the results of the medical tests you performed on me? 
 I wanted to get you away from that. 
 I was serious about Rio. 
 Just tell me, what happens to the results? 
 They go to Olivier. 
 From there, I don't know. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm going to take a shower, wash off the filth. 
 Is that okay with you? 
 So do you think the results might tell them I'm not Beth? 
 I don't know what the tests are for. 
 I explained that. This is my world, Sarah. 
 It is  you  that I'm worried about. 
 Yeah? 
 What is it that worries you about me? 
 Whatever it is you're not telling me. 
 Sarah. 
 Hey, Cosima, you were right... 
 Paul doesn't even know about clones. 
 See? It's a double blind... 
 The monitor's unaware of the purpose of the experiment. 
 That way, they can't skew the results. 
 Oh, hey. 
 I just had to get out of there. 
 I don't even know where I'm going. 
 Right, well, I may have a monitor dilemma of my own. 
 I'm new here this semester. 
 I didn't bring anybody with me, but someone wants to be friends. 
 Just stay away from them, Cos. 
 Stick to the science, yeah? 
 "Stick to the science"? 
 What am I, the geek monkey, now? 
 Seriously! Paul's a bad arse, okay? 
 He's ex-military. If somebody's trying to get close to you, just stay away. Right, the old "Do as I say, not as I do"? [ Alert beeps ]  Sorry. Look, Alison's calling through. Are we good? [Sigh] Sure. [ Alert beeps ] Hey. I need you. What's going on? Um, I have a situation. What kind of situation? Just get over here right now. You're it! Hey, that's not fair! Oh, then I'll get you again. Ha! Okay, okay, you're going to walk your sister to Aynsley's house and you're going to stay there. But, mom! Yes, it's going to be fun! No! Go! Tell her I said it's okay. [ Grunting ] Aah! Ooh. [ Clatter ] [ Beeping ] Where are you off to, Sarah? Uh. Alison? Why am I tied to the chair? Shh! Shh! Tell me what was really in the box, Donnie. What? Your special box. What was inside of it? Are you out of your mind? Untie me. No! Donnie, I have questions that need answers. Come on, Alison, is is insane! Don't worry, honey. It's all good. Isn't that what you always tell me? Think about what you really want to get off your chest. Or what, you're going to stick sequins on me? You moved the files. Files? What files? Your files that you have on me. From your box. Your special box. Aaah! Aaah! Ohhh! Oh ohh! [ Blowing ] Have you lost your mind?! I know what you do, Donnie! What? What do I do? You spy. You perform medical examinations on me in my sleep... What?! You turned my whole life into a big, embarrassing lie; and you switched the files in your special box for porno DVDs of "Big Boob Blowies"! Ohohoh! Please, no. Ahhahaha! Hey, Delphine. Hey.  Bonjour, Cosima. I'm bored. Well, you know, there's this lecture today that I was going to see. Wait, where is it? I was going to, if you want to come with me. Neolutionism, really? You've... you've heard of it? Yeah, it's kind of fringe, don't you think? Well I think that, as a Darwinist, it would interest you and this Dr. Leekie is a really, really interesting speaker. I saw his Ted talk online and... phew. Hmm. So? Sure. Why not? [ Beep ] Sarah, I can understand why you took off this morning, but I need... we need to know that the ground beneath us is solid. So, please... Let's talk about all this tonight. [ Beep ] Why do you do it, Donnie? Alison, I don't examine you in your sleep. Oh, no, no. Am I sick, like the German? What German? Who's German?! No, no, no! [ Knock at door ] What the hell is going on, Alison? Shh! Please, no. What are you doing? Please... agh. Alison, no! Come here! Eh, what's the emergency? Umm... You might want to sit down for this. I'll stand, thanks. Okay. Alison? Alison? Who's that? Donnie. Who's Donnie? He's my husband. What?! I think he's my watcher! Jesus Christ, Alison! What have you done? Aynsley: Yoohoo! Hello! [ Knocking, ringing doorbell ] Who's that? Oh. I completely forgot. [ Children chatting ] Oh, you're not ready for the potluck. Oh, yeah, um... You're not even dressed. Well, I was just thinking. Could we change venues? Change venues? Ally, what's wrong? Nothing, I'm just... I think I'm coming down with something. I think we should... Well, it's too late now, so just take some of your happy pills and let me help. Don't worry, we'll get this party started. Okay. What's up, Hendrix? Hello. Hi! Hi! Woman: Is this a pajama party? Good. Ally, nothing's ready. Oh, I know. Cover for me. Okay. What's all off-limits? Mmm! The basement. It's a disaster. Donnie's starting renos this week. Ah. Mm-hmm! Well, the kids are screaming for chips. I'll go get some from the pantry. Sausage rolls, freezer. Got it. Okay. ♪ We could be just fine 
♪ I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want ♪ A potluck, seriously? Seriously. Okay, you got to kick them out. I can't back out of the monthly potluck. It's my turn. But I have no gift bags; No ice; and no bartender, because my husband is tied to a chair. Alison, you need to take a deep breath. I hate yoga. Okay, you need to go up there and just play hostess, like nothing's wrong. Fine. You interrogate Donnie. What? Yes. You are the expert. Go in there and get that lying b*st*rd to confess. Wh... Are you serious? Be me. Put this on. What if he's just your husband? Sarah, I need you to help me with this. I impersonated you in front of your daughter. Now, it's your turn. ♪ I wanna (Ha) I wanna (Ha) I wanna (Ha) I wanna (Ha) ♪ 
♪ I wanna really, really, really wanna ♪ Felix: With a golf club? No, no, I can't bar tend. I've got a very handsome guest here. Please tell me  you're not with the morgue attendant again. No, but I plan to be. Hang on. Teddy, is that all you can handle? All right, looks like my afternoon just opened up. Okay. How soon can you be here? To Scarberia? Yeah. And dress suburban. You've got to be joking. I know, it sucks to be my sister. Don't forget the ice. [ Laughing ] Okay. The kids are looking for the gift bags. And we're running out of wine glasses. Where are your disposables? They are under the sink. No, top shelf, left hand side of the stove. I don't know. I don't know. What's going on downstairs? Sausage roll? No, thanks. So...? Meera wants to know the name of your contractor. Oh! I will give you his info. Perfect. Okay. Sausage? No. Okay, that's fine. She's drunk already? Whoopsie-whoo! Who put that chair there? Did you want any? And where the hell's Donnie? [As Alison] Hello, Donnie. Hello, Donnie. Donnie. [ Sigh ] Alison? Ah. Hello, Donnie. Alison. Shh, shh, shh! Shh! Ah! Can we stop now, please? Yes. After a few questions. You told me yesterday she was fine. She's right back in her dark place, Olivier. I stopped her from OD'ing on pills last night. She's quit the force, dumped her therapist. She has no one else. She has you, to share in this crisis, like any other event. Don't interfere unless it's critical. I need to know that I won't be blamed if she tries it again, if I can't stop her. You done well for us, Paul. As long as your subject makes her own choices, there are no wrong decisions. Yes? Then soldier on. Sarah: I know, Donnie, so you can tell me how it works. How what works? The double blind, monitoring. Alison, would you listen to yourself? I got up in the middle of the night to watch cricket! Cricket? The South African games start at 4:00 am. Is there nothing in my life left unexamined by you? Now take off the GD blindfold! [ Laughter, running footsteps ] The whole neighborhood is here? What kind of irrational nonsense is going through that head of yours? Hey, watch your tone, Donnie! Alison, get your frazzled, PMS sh1t together! Hey! You watch your tone! Your wife is the rock of this family! You will no longer speak down to her! Am I clear?! Yeah. Delphine: Cosima! Hey. Hey. I am so glad you came. Mm-hmm! You won't be disappointed. Yeah, I can tell. [ Both laugh ] Yeah, Dr. Leekie attracts diverse thinkers. Come. Okay. Oh. Neolution... A philosophy of today for tomorrow, rooted in our past, in the evolution of the human organism. But before we go to the future, let me take you back 3,000 years, to the great Greek philosopher Plato and his twilight years. [Hoarsely] Poor old Plato was going blind... [ Laughter ] Going lame, and losing his hearing! Now, imagine if he knew we could correct his sight, restore his hearing, and replace his ailing body parts with titanium ones. Plato would've thought we were gods! But we're not, we're just fundamentally flawed human beings. Your glasses, for example, make you somewhat, um, platonic. But within the very near future, I'll be able to offer you the ability to see into a spectrum never before seen by the naked eye... infrared, x-rays, ultraviolet. Are you interested? Maybe I'll just start with basic Lasik. [ Laughter ] And so you should. That's making an evolutionary choice. Neolution gives us the opportunity at a self-directed evolution and I believe that's not only a choice, but a human right. [ Clatter ] Ah, Felix, Felix, Felix. All right, Felix, time to party with the party. ♪ This is how we do it ♪ [ Knock at door ] ♪ This is how we do it ♪ Oh. Oh, sh1t, I totally thought you were Alison. Have you looked in the mirror? There's a thing on your head. sh1t, as they say, is completely sideways, Fe. What do you need? [ Laughs, snort ] Crackers. Hmm! What?! Do you have any crackers? How should I know, Charity? Why don't you check the cracker cupboard? Alison. Meera is talking. Where is Donnie? Oh, my God. Why isn't he helping you with this? He's tied up. Ally, don't you dare cover for him, not again and not to me. You know what I've been going through with Chad. [As beastie boy] Hey, ladies! Yes. Incoming. I am all over those sexy stretchies. You been working your glutes again? What's your program? Why is everybody asking me so many goddamn questions?! Hello, neighbors! Your bartender's here. I'm just going to have a quick word with our hostess and then I'm going to be right back to, uh, top you up. Yeah? Let's go. It's a gay bartender. That's awesome. Chad, shut your stupid mouth and feed the kids. ♪ All hands are in the air ♪ 
♪ and wave them from here to there ♪ 
♪ if you're an O.G. Mack or a wannabe player ♪ Felix: No. Oh, no. I screwed up, didn't I? It's not Donnie, is it? It's not him. But I whacked him and it felt so good. Is he really in there? Yeah, tied to a chair. Oh, my God. Okay, I'll go handle the mess upstairs. 
 
 ♪ The party's underway I tortured my husband, I messed up my family, and you're the only person I can talk to, and you're just another version of me. Come on. I'm a horrible person. I'm not even a real person. Of course you are. Look, you stood up to all this, so far. Mnh, mnh mnh mnh. Alison, Donnie says that he got up in the middle of the night to watch cricket. Cricket? Yeah. Look, Paul's military. He's a professional. You've known Donnie since, what? High school. Right, high school, yeah? So how could he be your monitor? [Crying] So he's just Donnie, eating, farting Donnie? My monitor is probably one of those bitches upstairs. Look, Alison, just... Alison?! [ Snoring ] ♪ Does it like nobody does ♪ 
♪ this is how we do it ♪ I know. I know, I know. Okay No no, Neolution is not Eugenical. Okay, so what is it? Is it Utopian? Neotopian, maybe? Cosima. Oh, my God, look. There he is. I would just love to meet him. Come on. Okay. What? Hello. Hi. ♪ [ Speaking French ] Ah,  c'est mon adversaire. Oui. You speak French. Oui.  I have a neurolingual chip. Bullshit. Good, a skeptic. Neural implants are something we're exploring, however. At the Dyad Institute. You've heard of us. Yes. Are they from the Dyad Institute? Ah, my "Freaky Leekies", as they've been dubbed in the media. It was once asked what my perfect human would look like. I offhandedly suggested silver-gray hair and one white eye. Little did I know. Well, I enjoyed your lecture very much. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you. You know, I'm in immunology. Mm. And you? Evo-devo, so, whenever somebody talks about the future, I always say "Show, don't tell." I hope you'll give  me the chance. Please, have a look at our work at Dyad. Adieu. You are such a brat. [ Chuckle ] [Gasp] No! Come on, let's get out of here. Come on! [ The Cardigans's "Lovefool" plays ] ♪ Dear, I fear we're facing a problem ♪ 
♪ you love me no longer, I know ♪ Mmm! Alison. Another pint of chablis? It's me, Fe. Oh, sh1t. Sorry. Code red. Alison just went down in a heap. No. We need to get her life out of the fire, somehow. Okay. Listen, I think that I may have spotted her real monitor. What? There. There you are. Here I am. What is with you? Hendrix! Oh! Hey! Nobody finds that funny, Chad. Whoa, whoa, easy! Just bouncing quarters here. I've seen you before. Do you work at the Plaza? Ha! I don't do plazas. Oh, how do you two know each other? Oh, um, because... He's, uh... I'm her acting coach. Felix. Aynsley, from across the street. You didn't tell me you were getting professional training, Ally.  Really? Hmm. Aynsley, do you want red or white? What do you think? Um... ♪ Love me, love me You run so fast. Did we lose them? Yes! Okay, so let's steal some bikes. Oh, no no no, that's too much crime for me. Oh, come on. I have a class to T.A. Oh, okay. All right. You know what's a very French thing to do? What? After a jogging like this, we like to smoke a nice little cigarette. Did you say "a jogging"? Yes. You did. Okay, just checking. You smoke? Do you want one? No, just pot for me. Ooh, really? Yes, I'm from San Fran, so... Ooh. I am going to get you  so  baked one day. Mm! Okay, one day. Okay. It's, um, it's really nice to make a friend in the Brave New World. Yeah. I have to go. Okay, yeah. Okay. Ciao. Bye.  Ciao. [ Snoring ] [ Grumble ] Donnie, sweetie, I'm so sorry about all this. Alison. Please untie me. I can't, until the party's over. [Tearfully] I bought mulled wine. If I can help... While you're down here, I want you to really think about us, what we've got, with our house and our kids. You don't want to lose that. That is a really good look on you. [ Ring ] [ Ring ] Yeah? Felix: You need to come upstairs, now. What's wrong? Vic is here. Vic? Yeah. Hi, Sarah. If you don't come upstairs, I'm going to start making friends, fast. Okay, fine. Not downstairs. Upstairs bedroom, 2 minutes. [ Snort ] [ Moan ] Beth. No scar. Sarah. Oh! Are you Sarah? Mm! Alison. You want some of this? Come to bed with me. [ Clatter ] [Muffled] Ow! Ow! Damn! That's worse! Ow! [ Crying out ] Ow! [ Shouting ] Look at all this sh1t. Whoa! A stroller and a latte and you could even fool me. You have 5 seconds, Vic. Oh, yeah? Or what, you're going to call neighbourhood watch? Neighbourhood watch! Hey. Hey. Keep your voice down. You and I have unfinished business. Sit. So, you faked your own death so... You could move on to a new scam, hmm? Who are you now, Sarah? [ Chuckle ] Sarah, it must be so confusing. You have no idea. You've got your money, Vic, and then some. 5 measly grand doesn't cover my finger, Whatever this scandal, I want a cut, or I'm going to blow your whole charade wide open. Let's move this along, yeah? What's it gonna take? Look at them. Hey! Could've been our kids. Got the wrong room, pal. You must be Vic. Yeah. And you are? Eh, eh, this is none of your business. Am I talking to you?! Whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Whistle] What's she done, this time? Ah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah. Hey, she works for me. You talk to me. Oh, yeah, is that right? Whoa. Eh, Vic. Whoa, whoa. Okay. All right, turn around. Turn around! Put your hands up. What do you want, Vic? Sarah and I have unfinished business. I want a cut of the play. I'm the taxman. Can't you see we're right in the middle of it? I appreciate that. Got a whale on the line. So can we go somewhere else, before someone walks in, talk out in the garage? Vic. Okay, after you two. Aah! Uh, Ally, can we talk? Excuse us, ma'am. You can talk inside. No no no no... We got this, Alison. Alison. Who was that? Uh, wh-which one? The impossibly handsome one, obviously. Oh, a friend from university. College. [Crying] Oh, God, Ally, I know you're sick of hearing about Chad. Uh, no. I think the asshole is having another affair. Slowly, slowly. Okay, let's go. Slowly, let's go. Don't move. Sit on the chair. Let's go, buddy. Come on, go, sit! Let's stand. I'm not going to hurt you. It's that slut from spinning class. After he swore he'd never do it again. Are people talking? Has he said anything to Donnie? No. No? Not a word. Um, every marriage has its little secrets. We all have them. I'm sorry. I know you and Donnie are going through things, too. Hmm? College friend. I've, uh... I should get back to the party. Your shirt. What? You've changed your shirt since the party started. Oh, one of the kids must've spilled something on it. One of the kids. I should get back to the kitchen. You're acting very strange. I'm going to get to the bottom of it. What do you want, man, huh? I want you to tell me everything about her. About Sarah? What are you going to do with that? Huh? What are you going to do with that, buddy? What's her last name? Manning. Sarah Manning. Does she have a twin sister? What? No, man, she doesn't have a twin. She's an orphan. Do you know Beth or Alison? Who? Listen, buddy. Calm down, okay? Look, I'm not trying to shake you down. I'm in love with her. I do crazy things for her. Okay, okay! Calm down, man! All right. Calm down, buddy. Close the door, Sarah Manning. Paul, he doesn't have anything to do with this. It's true, man. I swear to God. Listen to her. Who's the woman on the couch inside? Look, he doesn't know anything! Why is her husband tied to a chair? Listen man, I swear to God, I don't know anything. Sarah, could you please tell him. Could you please call him off! Could you call this guy off! I don't know! Be a man, Vic! All right. Okay, I'm a man. You are putting me in a very precarious position, Sarah. I can't have any loose ends with this thing. This guy seems like a very loose end. He doesn't know anything, Paul! Look, man, I don't want to die, all right? Just calm down. Please, man. Eh, Paul? I'll explain everything. Beth, Alison... I'll tell you what's going on, just let him go. Okay, look! I swear to God, I'm not going to say a word, all right? Not one word. Sarah can you please do something, goddamn it! Look, look, I'll be honest with you, Paul! Mommy? Got you, mommy! Hey, hey! Gemma, get out. Mom... Aah! Aaaaah! Aggghhh! Ahh! Aaah! [ Snoring ] Quick siesta? I don't feel so good. Okay. Let's get you to bed. Come on. Okay. That's it. Whoops. Okay. Whoops. It's fine. Don't worry about it. Move. You and me end here, Vic. Never come back. Sarah, wait a minute. Alison! I just c... did you fly down here? What? I literally just put you to bed. I... I got up. Oh. We still haven't met. I'm Aynsley from across the street. You're? Just visiting. Um, like I said, every marriage has its little secrets. This one's between consenting adults. No one gets hurt. Um, you know what? You're right. This is none of my business. [ Chuckle ] Time to go home. Ahem. Donnie, about my little, um, breakdown... No. No no no, it's my fault. You're right... You are the rock of this family. I'm so sorry. Of course you knew. It wasn't just p0rn in my special box. You remember Ginny Nusbaum? From college? I don't know how to say this, but she and I had an affair once. Okay, twice, but you and I were broken up. We traded letters for a few years after it ended... Dirty talk, mostly... Tsk. Then, she got Lupus and I never heard from her again. She got Lupus? I don't know what happened to her. I'm so sorry. I was just trying to hold on to something personal, something... [Sobbing] I'm sorry. Paul: Drink? Yeah. Talk. Clones. Clones? Well, we don't use the c-word. That's Alison's rule. But, yeah, we're genetic identicals. Not triplets, genetic identicals. Yeah, we count nine of us, so far. That's what you do, Paul, that's why you were watching Beth. You monitor human clones. You should've just told me that, in the first place. [ Beep-beep ] Tiens. Comment va-t'il? Bien, je crois. Stay away from me! I have an offer for you. You have until midnight. If there was a club here, don't you think I'd know about it? Beth's paperwork's a mess. It's like she's never done it before. Let's get forensics to pull the hand, run a fresh set of prints. Art, you got to see this. The subject isn't who we thinks he is. She's an imposter. Now, make this right, Afghanistan goes away. I can tell you have a very unique perspective, Cosima. She's very cheeky. But that's why I like her. Detective Art Bell. I need to talk to you about Beth Childs.
