 I saw a girl kill herself. 
 And she looked exactly like me. 
 Elizabeth Childs. 
 I'm going to go up to her flat. 
 To find out who she is or to rob the rest of her sh1t? 
 Hello? 
 Holy shite. 
 Beth is a cop. I'm a cop. 
 Is this evil twin's money? 
 Yeah, that's enough to get somewhere safe with my daughter. 
 I'm going to hang on to that money until you're cleared. 
 Who the hell is Maggie Chen? 
 That's the woman Beth shot. 
 Beth. What's happened? 
 A lot. 
 Something's different. You are not Beth. 
 The German's dead. 
 Someone shot her right in front of me! 
 Cosima: Holy sh1t, it's true! 
 That someone is killing us. Beth, you need to get rid of the body. Did you get the German's briefcase? No. Why? Get the briefcase before they do. [ Ringtone ] Screw it. Hello? Cosima: Who is this? Beth's indisposed. Is this Alison? How dare you show your face in front of my children. This is my neighborhood. You wait for a call. Hey. I'm Cosima. How many of us are there? Okay, define "orphan", Sarah. Orphan, orphanage. So, you don't know your birth parents? No, I was fostered out, then legally adopted and I came here. When? Adopted? Like 8. Came here around 12. Heartbreaking. Can we get back to Beth, please? Suicide? I don't accept that. This one's some kind of lowlife grifter! How do we know she didn't push her? Oi! I already told you... I didn't want to be her. I got stuck! I was running from my own sh1t. I can only imagine. Alison, I'm very sorry about Beth, okay? But she was losing it, like, clinically. She was a cop. She had tools. If she couldn't cope, then, I mean...! Look, can you just tell me what the hell this is? Don't tell her anything! Short answer? No. How are we all related? We're not! Well, we are, by nature. She's referring to nurture. Just give us the briefcase that you got from the German. I'm not giving you sh1t 'til you give me some answers. You don't rate answers. Alison! Fine! She wants in? We're clones. We're someone's experiment and they're killing us off! Is that helpful?! Hmm? Mommy? Gemma! Who are those ladies? Da da da da da. Just mommy's friends. How did you get out of bed? Sorry. I wanted to float that whole clone thing a lot softer. Come on, Sarah. Shite! You're not supposed to be parked here at night. I'm waiting for someone. Well, this is a neighborhood watch block, so... Come on, girl. Bitch that guards hell. Screw it. [ Door thuds ] Cosima: We are genetically identical, or whatever. It's actually kind of cool. As far as... sh1t! sh1t! Su... was there someone there? Oh, my God! Freeze! What are you doing in my yard? Don't! Do not shoot me! Please! Why are you here?! Do not shoot! Please! Hey! Alison! Alison! Put it down. Get out of the way! He's with me! Okay? Move! It's okay. Oh, sh1t! You point a gun at my brother again, I will kick the living shite out of you! [ Sob ] We need to get my sh1t. What the hell were you doing here? Hey, you need this? You just broke the first rule of clone club. What, "never tell anyone about clone club"? Hi. Awkward. I'm Cosima. You have my number. You want answers? I want the briefcase. Seriously, it's life-or-death. Felix: You've got to be kidding me. Clones? Clones?! They're not me. They're not. They're completely different people. Soccer-mum Sarah, dreadlock science-geek Sarah? Arguably more attractive than the real Sarah. Yeah, I was there, thank you. How can it be, though? What difference does it make, Fe? Last time I checked, human cloning was illegal, let alone impossible. Yeah, leave it out, okay? It doesn't matter! It does matter! Dead Beth, dead German, those two, three other Euros, you... that's eight. And dreadlocks is going on about her blood samples, saying it's life-or-death. You can't just ignore it. Yes, I can! I'm just me, okay? The song remains the same. We get the 75 grand back from Beth's partner, we get Kira, and get as far away from all this as possible! Am I going insane? Hey, Beth. I thought you were still off. Uh, yeah, just can't get enough. Is Art around? Beth! What the hell's going on? Yeah, I got to talk to you for a couple seconds. Hey, company? Yeah. Look, things are bad with Paul. Okay. We're dividing up our sh1t. Any second, he's going to find that joint account empty. Look, you get the cash when you're back on active duty. That's the deal. Childs! Sorry, just saying hello. No, you're not. Both of you. Bad news... you're reinstated. Art: Oh, sh1t! Welcome back. Well, thank God. Buckle up, kid, we got a 10-45. Uh, hey, two seconds. sh1t. [ Door opens ] Do you want help with that? Yeah, you mind? [ Scoff ] Dispatcher: Quarry Road and Ulster. Confirmed 10-45. Forensic onsite. So, Art, about our deal. I'm reinstated now. Hey, I'm not carrying around 75 grand in the trunk, all right? Just call us in. Heading for the 10-45. Roger. Responder, please identify. Uh... Fifty-five. Fifty-five heading for the 10-45, Roger. Out. Copy. Ahem! What? Something wrong? Body's chewed up pretty bad. What do you think? I think some idiot didn't realize they were burying a body next to an active quarry. [ Gasping ] Got a pretty good tire print over there. I'd say the body wasn't in the ground more than two, maybe three, days. Hey, welcome back. Now, this would be your industrial sausagemaker. Nice of them to lend a hand, though. [ Laughter ] Prints? They'd better hit, because reconstructing the face is going to be tough. Hey! Can we get the guy to open this thing up? Uh, I need to make a call, yeah? One sec. I can't talk, or meet. Just answer the question. Oh, okay, okay. Our fingerprints are close enough to flag a match, yeah. Why? Beth's partner found the German... or at least part of her. Part of her? Yeah, I messed up when I buried her. They have a fingerprint, Cosima. Oh, wait, are you being Beth right now? Pretending to be a bloody cop, so I need to know if the bloody fingerprints will flag a bloody match! Whoa! Okay, okay, don't freak out! They'd need to use interpol to find the German, which is unlikely,  but if one of us had a criminal record here... do you have a criminal record? Just petty fraud, assault, whatever. Wasted youth, all right? If the body matches me, the cops will see a mugshot of somebody who looks like Beth, only it's yours truly, and I'm already supposed to be dead. Wow. Wow, welcome to the trip, man. That is not helpful. Yeah, okay, sorry. Just don't bolt, okay? Don't bolt. They can't run prints instantaneously, so we do have some time here. How much time? Bring me the briefcase and we'll talk, okay? Beckwith will have an exact time of death soon, but 'til then, I say we ballpark two, three days, see who's missing. And fingerprints, what, a couple days? Yeah, you know the lab. Hopefully, overnight. Look, Art, um, this sh1t with Paul is about to go sideways, okay? I need to get to the bank. Let me see your weapon. Huh? Come on, show it to me. It's empty. Yeah, what? We left in a hurry. You rode with me empty! Art, it's a 10-45 for legs, right, Art, like, I mean, who am I going to shoot? That's bullshit, Beth, for regs  and  your partner. Look, if the shooting has you trigger-shy, Beth, you got to... No. I'm not, I'm not. I'm not. Just give me an hour or two to get up to speed, for Christ's sake. You can get up to speed on the desk, then. I'll work this with Deangelis. Now get outta here. Hey, Art. Look, if you ask me about that money one more time, Beth, I swear to God, it's going in the shredder. Hey. Don't worry, you get used to it. To clones? Yeah, I'm not buying that. How many of us do you have to meet, Sarah? Can I have the briefcase, please? I want some answers, first. Well, the answers are in the briefcase. Let me guess... you're the smart one, you're the wild one. Would you believe we're clones? [ Scoff ] Bourbon, rocks. You got it. So you're the scientist the German was on about. Yes... well, PhD student, evolutionary developmental biology at university of Minnesota. I'm heading back there tonight. The German was sick. Should I be worried about that? Well, if you give me the case, I'll know in a couple weeks. Do you know who shot her in the head? [ Exhales ] Okay, ahem! So, six months ago, Katja contacted Beth with this crazy story about her genetic identicals being hunted in Europe. "Hunted"? Brilliant. I know. So Beth used facial- recognition software to find driver's licenses in north America. Two matches. You and soccer bitch. Yeah, right. But who is the original? Who's created us? Who's killing us? We need to know, but, we lost our cop, so, however you manage to get into her shoes, we really need you to stay there. Stay a cop to help you? To help  us. Help us find out who's killing us. How?!  I'm not a cop. Beth's partner's going to figure that out. Being Beth is what got me into this mess, in the first place. I know, I know. I get it, I get it. But you can't run away from her. Look, we are your biological imperative now, okay? Katja's fingerprints will match your fingerprints. So get to Katja's fingerprint results, somehow. I think that's our only option. All right. Just answer me one thing... Anything, yes. If we're genetically identical, do you get that little patch of dry skin between your eyebrows? [ Laughs ] That's good. Try to keep your sense of humor. Beth couldn't. No cream? You're booked on the range day after tomorrow, 4:00. "The range"? The gun range? Are you with me or not? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what about Jane Doe? Beckwith filled a bucket with fragments from the hopper. Couple solids so far... dyed red hair. Like bright red. And laying out the skull fragments, she's 99% sure she found entry and exit wounds. A shooting. So what about the prints? Start calling. And keep calling while you clear that shitpile of a desk. Hey, sorry about poaching your seat on this, eh? He's all yours. Let's go. Yeah. [ Ring ] Detective Bell. Yeah, well, what can you tell me about her? Jane Doe. Hey, hey! Shh! Shh! You want to give me that again? [Electronic] Am I speaking to your partner now, too, Art? Actually, we love voicechange apps, so the whole office is listening. She was just one of a few, unfit for family, horse glue. So you didn't like her very much. How about you tell us her name. She expired at allenside park. [ Dial tone ] So, what, Stephen Hawking did it? The call came to me. "Just one of a few, unfit for family..." "Horse glue"? sh1t! What... what else did they say? They asked if I was the lead on the quarry body. Listen, before we go, we'll check the desk, to see who took the call. Yeah. Are you going to allenside? Yeah. Check the log, to see if there were any shots fired down there. Hey, look, I'll see you in a bit, okay? Hey! Raj. Detective. Beth. Hi. So you probably know I've been off for a while. Yeah. Yeah, nightmare. PTSD, fatal civilian shooting, inquiry, medication, the whole enchilada. Gum? Uh, thanks. So I guess you're back, then, right? Mm, I'm benched. I'm trying to slip in without, you know, a ripple, but, on the down-low, I'm a little scattered, memorywise. You think you could help with a few basics? Oh, like resetting your password? Yes, like that. And the whole procedure for fingerprint results. I said an hour, Childs. I haven't checked yet. They're in, though? Because I got a Jane Doe with zero leads. They're probably in my inbox. Just hang on. Yep, not a problem. Childs! "Results from Central". I'm helping you out. I got to log those! It's all good! Nothing, anyway. Don't do that again, Childs. I don't know, Art, you think someone's jerking your chain? Auto glass. Hmm. Looks like a fast exit that way. I don't see any casings. Could be line-of-fire, at range. Hmm. Siobhan: I've seen your elaborate ruses and guises before, but how do you do this, how do you fake your own demise beneath a train? Wouldn't you rather know why? I don't care to know why. Because I saw a way to dump Vic and get out of that life and get away with Kira. Ha! Take her on the run with you? Brilliant. New clothes and a Jaguar do not a mother make. Lee of the point. Ugh! I don't remember. Buffleheads. Barrow's goldeneye. Just passing through. I'll set up a visit, but the only way you will regain custody of Kira is to show me that you can be still. You're not her legal guardian. Mine either, anymore. You can visit. Any other approach, and I will stop lying to social services for you. You wouldn't do that to Kira. No. I'd do it to you. Hey, someone cleared this out, laid down in here. Around here? Probably homeless. Yeah, but someone moved this into position. Hey, this look like a blind to you, a log for someone to lay a rifle on? Weeds knocked down for sight lines. Where are you? Cosima: Uh, back at school. What, school? What? Oh, sh1t! Right. Right, right, right. Minneapolis, sh1t! What's going on? Well, I managed to scrap the fingerprint results... for a while, anyway...  but the killer contacted Art, Cosima. He's already at the scene where Katja was shot. Okay, that's good. Just stick with him. I can't! He's benched me because I'm bloody useless! 
 
 I need help, Cosima. He wants me on the range tomorrow. I've never even fired a gun. All right, well, just hold tight. We know somebody who can help with that. Are you serious? If you are. You know we got a motorcycle tread over here, Art. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, it's a good print. Could be the shooter's getaway. Yeah, but a long gun on a motorcycle? Could be the weapon broke down, right? Yeah, it could be. Hey, I got something over here. [ Shutter clicks ] Head shot. Bright red hair. It has to be this morning. Art's got me chasing down motorcycle models from tire tracks and I'm shooting bloody targets at a gun range tomorrow. Well, I can't just conjure a sitter out of thin air. It's weekend primetime, Sarah. [ Knock at door ] Well, then, we're all screwed. Aren't we? Donnie! Ahem. Can you watch the kids for a couple of hours today? Golf. Give it! On television? No, I have a tee time, remember? I'm sorry, I'm coming up empty. I may have a solution. Gemma, Oscar, this is Felix. Hello! Brilliant. So I'm going out for a couple of hours, so you be good or mommy's going to be very upset, okay? Same goes for you. So, what now? Does your daddy have a drinks trolley? What's that? Don't worry. I'll find it. You. You want to dress up like a little girl? No! Well, I don't have anything for you, then. I'll dress up like a boy. We can work with that. Raj: No, the make and model match the tread that Deangelis sent you. Sports bike, Suzuki SV650. Black tank, custom pipes, and stolen when? Reported four days ago. I should probably get back to my real job now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, um, put out a... You know. An apb. Yes. Yes, asap. Sorry, I'm at the the doctor. My phone's about to die. Okay, I'll get someone to do it. Thanks, Raj. Well, go. Okay, reload, try again. So, most city cops carry Glocks, but a Walther P99, it has an optional- sized hand grip. It's good for women, Beth said, particularly women living their lives like rats in a lab. Is that what you think? Well, what else could it be? Someone is covering up their illegal experiments by wiping us out. Well, whatever it is, I need to protect my family, so Beth taught me how to shoot. [Tearfully] For that, I am grateful to her. I'm sorry you lost her, but anything you can tell me about her will help. [Scoff] I fail to see how someone like you can fill Beth's shoes. Truth is, I barely knew Beth. She was all business, but I admired her. She didn't pry. She was discreet. She didn't bring her foster brother to my house. I didn't know the rules of clone club, did I? Can you not use the c-word? Please. [ Squeak ] sh1t. Stop here. I'll walk the rest. [ Sigh ] So my bottom line is my children can't know their mother is a freak. Things have to stay on a need-to-know basis. Yeah, I'm fine with that. Good. So, we've made a decision to trust you. Really? Sarah, this is my life now and I'm doing the best I can. Ahem, so Beth had, um, a substantial sum, sort of a fund she used to buy information we couldn't get officially. Okay. We were a cop, a scientist, and myself. The fund was how I could contribute. How much? $75,000. You could rob me blind. But we're hoping you realize you can't run from this. So, can you con her bank, or not? Good. Oh, Gemma! Look, mom, we're crossdressers! No, you are not. I'm you! Oh! You're back. Felix! Don't go! Can Felix stay the night, mom? No! My work here is done, I'm afraid. No! Stay, Felix. Adios,  dragsters. Wow, okay, so, the money belongs to Alison. Mm-hmm. So what are you going to do now? Are you going to rip off your new sis and abscond with Kira? She's not my sister and, yeah, that's exactly what we do. Well. [ Lock turns ] sh1t! Hide! You cannot hide in minimalist furniture! Go! sh1t! What? You're not supposed to be here. Nice. I thought... you're staying at Cody's for a while. I think that's a good idea! Well, I think you're being a bitch. I'm the bigger person, here. I need a change of clothes. Uh, I've been reinstated, Paul. Hey. Oh. Well, how do you feel about that? What, are you painting by numbers? I guess I am. Okay, I'm sorry I'm like this, Paul. You're not like this, Beth, it's your job. Yeah, but I'm a cop first, Paul, but, sh1t. How would you like it if I started pulling this schizophrenic hot- and-cold crap on you? Maybe you should, Paul. I mean, seriously, where are we going with this? Sorry, got to go. [ Laughs ] Oh. My. God. Oh! She doesn't want to break up with big-dick Paul, unh. He smells it in her musk. You are stuffed! Oh, holy sh1t. Oh, don't worry, I bet he's w*nk*ng already. Oh, he'd better be. Oh! Paul, all soapy. No, no, no, no! Ugh, ah! Eye on the prize, okay? Get the money back from Beth's other partner, get out. [ Buzz ] Maybe it's your lady-grip walther. You like your big Glock, don't ya? [ Chuckle ] So, two sets of tire tracks at the crime scene... one motorcycle and one car? Yeah, but there had to be three people there. So if the killer's on a motorcycle, then, what, he has an accomplice, drives the Vic to the quarry? Or the Vic has a driver, who doesn't go to police, panics, and half-ass buries the body? Yeah, the body dump doesn't match the professional hit. Exactly. And I got something else for you, Beth. You're going to love this. That was in the sniper's nest. Yeah, we got a live one. Phone calls, leaving clues, messing with us. [ Ring ] Man: Range 7! Weapons down, please! Det Childs. Yeah, Suzuki? Okay, hang on a sec. All clear! Okay. Thanks. Patrol spotted my stolen Suzuki down in Parkdale. It's a long shot, but may as well see if the tires match. Is this the stolen sport bike? Yeah, it looks like it. All right, let's find the super. My son, my son! Yeah, I know, he's not home, but the motorcycle, does it belong to a renter? Upstairs! My son no here. Thank you. I thought you were the one who's supposed to deal with the nonenglish- speaking majority. Yeah, my Ukrainian sucks. Easy access. Motorcycle gloves. [ Knocks on window ] It's open. What you got there? Uh... "For you formed my inward parts; You knitted me together in my..." "Mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made." Bibles, dolls. This perp's got some deepseated spiritual problems. [ Gunfire ] [ Muffled exclaiming ] Art, you're hurt! Art, you're hurt! Go! Go? No! I'm okay! Go! Go after him! Go! sh1t. Freeze! Police! sh1t. sh1t! sh1t. Shots fired! 780 Bain. Bain and Heward! Foot pursuit in progress. [ Dialing ] [ Ring ] Art. Where are you? I think he went west between the two... the rowhouses. I think he went into one of the abandoned buildings here. Beth! [ Gasping ] Beth! No! [ Hyperventilating ] Beth. [ Sniffling ] [European accent] Good riddance, Elizabeth Childs. I'm not Beth! [ Gasp ] Dirty little copy cop. Who are you? Ogh! Not yet, not-Beth. [ Sobbing ] [ Gasping ] Art: Beth! Beth! Jesus Christ! Are you okay? Hey. I'm fine, I'm fine. Where'd he go? Hey! Okay, okay, I gotcha. I gotcha, come on. Sarah: All I saw was hoodie. He hit me from behind. Then you struggled with him at close quarters? Yeah, I was almost out. I never saw his face. Lieutenant. I almost lost not one, but two detectives. How the hell are you in this without backup, Art? It was a thread, lieutenant. It was a flimsy lead on a stolen bike. Well, it sure hit. Are you sure you're all right? I'm fine. Just let me take her home. I never should've told you to go after him. Of course I'm going to go after him, Art. It's not your fault. No, no, I should've had your back. You had mine. I didn't have yours. Yes, you did. Look, sh1t happens fast, okay? Will you please? I'm not going to let you drive me home like an invalid, okay? I just need a shower and an early start so we can catch this guy, okay? Hey. Your money's all there. You did have it in the trunk. Sorry I held it over you. Guess I owe you one. No, we're square, Art. Hey, you're not going to hug me, are ya? See you in the morning. Are you sure about this? Oh, man. Bloody Mrs S. She's right. Really? What kind of mother am I if I snatch my own daughter? A crap one, I agree. And if I rob Alison, run now and never tell my... Clones? Oh, God, we do have to find another word for that. Don't tell them what, Sarah, what happened? After all this, you're really going to go and just give the money back to bitchface? Mrs. S gave me one visit. I need to get it right. Okay, well, this has taken years off my life. Now can you please tell me what in the hell happened to your face. [ Laughs ] Ah. Ah!
