 My neighbor Aynsley always thought she was better than me. 
 You have to learn to forgive yourse... 
 Then I killed her. 
 Listen, DeAngelis, you want Alison Hendrix, you show up tomorrow with my paperwork. 
 Do you smell salt? 
 I may have spiked his tea. 
 Look, I don't know what kind of game you're running, Vic, but you better call me. 
 Must've been the pressure of family day. 
 We want to take you to your children. 
 [Crying] You took my babies from inside me. 
 Your eggs. 
 My father, he... 
 He made them whole for you. 
 Hello, Helena. 
 Take me to my babies. 
 You gave me Kira's stem cells? 
 It is a finite source. 
 Unless you bring her in for more. 
 [Cough] 
 [Gasp] 
 Cosima! 
 Rachel. 
 Hello, father. 
 How is it the unmonitored tramp was successful? 
 In her fertility? 
 You are all barren by design. 
 Agh! 
 Aaaah! Leekie killed Rachel's mother. My father sends his regards. It's already over. Let me know when it's done, yeah? Go, now. You might survive. [Honk] Get in! You ruined my marriage. I quit! [Gunshot] [Squeak] Where is Aldous? Aldous suffered a fatal heart attack on one of our jets. I killed Dr. Leekie. [Slam] [Brightly] I cleaned the car. What are you doing? I think those are his brains. [Sigh] They're congealed. Oh. Okay. Pitter-patter, Donnie, come on. Let's get to it. Donnie, grab it. Well, you're whipping it in my face. You want to do the body like this or like this? I think we need to go... Diagonal? Yep. Hold up. Hold up. If you're not going to hold it together... Okay. No, I got this. I got this. I got this. You ready? [Grunt] Oh! Oh, God. Oh, I can't. [Hyperventilating] I'm gonna throw up. I'm gonna throw up. Don't throw up, Donnie. Please, don't throw up. Just... I'll lift it up. I'll lift it up. All right, you just hold on to Alexis's hand, there. She's the midwife. I've done this many times. You may feel just a little bit  of discomfort, all right? Now... You're doing very well and you're very strong. It's just the catheter, threading through the cervix. What is cervix? Well, when the time is right, it'll open, wide enough to let the baby pass. For the embryos. Those are my babies? That's right. I'm going to inject these into your womb and then, they will implant themselves in the lining of your womb and they'll start to grow, just as nature intended. And... That's it. God willing, in 9 months, we'll be welcoming a brand-new you into the world. Maybe even twins. How is she? The growths have spread from Cosima's uterus and lungs to her esophagus, all her epithelial tissue, and, now, her kidneys. We know there's a way. Yes, but it's Kira. Only until we can buy the time for Duncan to find a cure. We need to convince Sarah we have no designs beyond that treatment. Duncan was one thing, but her daughter... Please. Things are different now. I've been lied to as well. She won't believe you. Do you? Uh... I am in the middle, committed to my subject. Well said. Dr. Cormier, I'd like you to take over as interim director of the program. Me? The chair is vacant. You understand the human side and the science. You'd be a wonderful ambassador. And you need to sway Sarah. It's not a bribe. Or a ploy. You're uniquely qualified. We could take this program in an entirely new direction. Sarah: So, you're the new Leekie. Interim. I didn't ask for it. Right. We know what Rachel's after. My daughter already pulled out her own tooth, Delphine. I'm sorry. The stem cells had limited effect. The disease is spreading too rapidly. What about Duncan? Gene therapy. His synthetic sequences. Even if we pinpoint the genetic cause, a therapy is months away, at best. But if we can reboot her immune system... With my kid's bone marrow? Please. Rachel claims that she's serious about forging a new relationship. [Siobhan laughs] Oh, and you believe her? I believe that she's as invested in this as any of you. I don't know if I trust Rachel, but, at least, we could save Cosima. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't her only chance. Cosima: Yeah, it totally freaked me out, but I'm feeling way better. Alison: Oh, Cosima. [Sniffle] How about these nose tubes? Sexy, right? Cannulalingus. [Laughs] [Coughs] I had no idea it was so bad, Cosima. Oh, hey, don't don't don't don't don't do that, please. Just seeing you guys is making me feel better. We want to help, Cosima,  but we're not going to bring Kira in to DYAD. I... Of course not. Sarah, I don't want you to do that. I'm so sorry I put you in this position. And I feel like such a child. I mean, I'm so caught up in my own problems. No, dude, they're real problems. How's it going with Donnie? Fine. Ask 'em. We're working through it, you know? No, now, right now. We're going to discuss things on our end come on. And we'll get back to you soon. One thing. One final thing. [Sniffle] Did anything come of Dr. Leekie's demise? [Cough] What do you mean? Like officially, he died on a private jet. That's bullshit. So, what, no investigation, no body, nothing? It's DYAD. They'll do anything to keep the whole thing secret. Why say Leekie died on a plane? He didn't die on a plane. No, he died in your car. Yes. I'm sorry. But why the DYAD cover story? Maybe they think he's dead. Maybe they told him to be dead and go live in Guadalupe, only he's in our freezer. I know what to do. Oh, you do, do you, Donnie? Mm-hmm. As long as no one finds the body, we're clear. So we dump him in the lake. With weights. Do we have a boat?! Have you ever seen "Dexter"? I mean, random scuba divers are finding everything! We can't risk transporting him, Donnie. Fine! Then we bury him in the yard! No. Not in the yard. [Cawing] Just let me do it. I got this. Donnie. [Chuckling] All right, fine, you try. Good luck. How are you feeling? I have gas. There's plenty more of that to come. Now, let's get you dressed. I have something I'd like to show you. This is our nursery and preschool. So feel free to spend as much time here as you wish. You're part of our family now. Boo! [Chuckle] Thank you. Thank you, Gracie. We'll be all right. You look tired, Mark. Nightmares again. When I think about what you've done for country, just 19, and for what? For profit, for glory. [Scoff] They only ever gave me a mission, but, you gave me a purpose. Well, I thank God, every day, that you went awol. Mark, it's no secret that you and Gracie are... Well, that you're fond of one another. Don't worry. Son, you've got my blessing. Thank you. But, Mark, it's time for Gracie to bear fruit, so what I need to know is are you ready to stand by her as her husband? It could work, if it's our own terms, our own security. I'm not even sure if I want this on the table. S, if there's an option for Cosima, I have to consider it. I know. I know. Shh shh shh shh shh. Hey, God, Kira's going to hear you. Now, what's going on? I have a friend, works at a private pediatric clinic. She might be able to help us. But, it's not without risk. Well, okay, then. We're not going to do it. My sister's dying, Fee. End of the day, it's not your decision. It's not any of ours. Does auntie Cosima need another tooth? No, she needs something else now. Um, something called "bone marrow". They take it out of your hip, but they have to use a big needle. I don't like needles. I know. I know, but they put you to sleep, so you can't feel anything. You don't have to feel bad, love, if you don't want to do it. Will auntie Cosima die? [Sniffle] She's not doing too well, so, she might. Then... Okay. Oh, God, you're the bravest thing I know. [Sniffle] I'll make the call. I have her phone. She's clean. So's the kit. Thank you, Benjamin. This is Dr. Parks. She'll be doing the procedure. Hello. I'll take you back when you have what you need. Okay. Hello, Felix. Delphine. Hey. You promise you'll take care of Cosima, yeah? Yes. Let's see how Kira's doing. You can wait right here until they're ready for you. Okay. Are you going to stand there all day, Mr. Funt? I'm here to help. Really? And where did you get your genetics degree? I can source another computer. Anything you need? No, we're good. Couldn't get my hands on a 6502 processor, but this one shares a chipset with the 65c02. He's a virgin, in case you couldn't tell. [Chuckle] [Buzz] Aw, shoot-darn. It didn't work. Oh, but it did, my good man. That's the infertility sequence? God, no wonder we're all screwed up. It's encoded. It's a vigenère's cipher and I brought the key with me. I'll need you to generate a transcription algorithm, Scott, hmm? This is just killer. [Laughs] Yeah. [Cough] [Grunting] Donnie, don't. Please. Ugh! Lord and butter, Donnie! Don't spread it around. Keep it on the plastic! Look, this isn't easy for me, all right? Oh, I know. You're not a tools guy, are you? Not the tools, the whole thing! I'm not as perfectly comfortable with manslaughter as you! At least I had the good sense to leave mine where she dropped. He was in my car! I can't do anything... Mummy! Hey! No no no no! Get out of here. Out out out out, out. Get out. Out! This isn't safe. But there's a man here to see you. Come on, let's go. Okay. Okay, out. Lock the door, Donnie. You! Hi, Alison. Get out of my house. Just listen. Everybody, upstairs. Go! Everybody! I'm staying. Go! This is not a good time, Vic. Yeah, I can see that. What's up with your garage? Oil change. Renovating. Donnie, right? I'm Victor. Don't talk to him! What do you want? All right! Alison, we need to air [Sniffle] some things out, um, for our recovery. You know, my stuff with Sarah and how you two are related, and the thing you told me about Aynsley. You told him? Told me what? I don't know. Please, man, talk to me. I'm in a lot of pain. You get out of my house! You're cold. You know that? Oh, give me a break. And you deserve her. Out! Adiós, amigos. Yeah, that's right. Think he's gone? Henrik: So, the doctor sailed north to the arctic, amongst the icebergs, but his creation pursued him with a terrible vengeance because the doctor had never shown his creation any love. And so, when they finally came face-to-face, they sat down and they had a great, big bowl of iceberg cream. [Laughter] Okay, children, naptime. [Squeal] Come on, let's go, now. ♪ Okay, naptime ♪ 
♪ it's naptime, naptime ♪ One day,  this room will be full of your children. It's time to get ready, Gracie. [Child giggling nearby] [Sternly] You're not listening, Faith. Ow! I just wanted to touch her hair. Don't talk back to me. Mummy, you're hurting me. You're lucky you're not getting the strap. [Whack] Ow! It's naptime. Do as you're told. Shall we head back, then? [Gasping] There was a woman in convent like you. You touch her again, and I will gut you like a fish. [Gasp] [Vital-signs monitor beeps] [Crying] I'm going to be here the whole time, okay? And I'll hold your hand, yeah? Can you count back from 100 for me, Kira? 100, 99, 98, 97. Sleep tight, monkey. Okay, yeah? Shh. Shh. Oh, my God. Sh-she won't feel a thing. I promise. What kind of mother am I? It's all right. The best and the bravest. And a very, very good sister. Oh, God. I'm sorry. [Vital-signs monitor beeps] This is the last one. She'll wake up in a few hours, but she should rest here tonight. She will be fine in a couple of days. And Cosima? This gives her a real chance. [Sniffle] All right, sweetie. Anh anh anh. Don't move. I've used this before and I'll do it again. Take it easy, bro. Get up. Take it easy. Get. Up. I was just looking for your washroom. Shut up. You used me in rehab and, now, you're harassing my kids and peeping in my garage? Alison! It's not what you think. I don't really give a sh1t what you're doing. I think I should shoot him, Ali! Donnie, don't. That's how I see this ending! It doesn't have to be that way, buddy! Donnie, please, relax! Baby, I'm telling you, this is a hair-trigger. One second, you're here. The next second, bang! Listen, I don't wanna die! You can't shoot me! There's a cop outside! All right?! There's a cop in a van outside! What? Angela DeAngelis? Alison, she's been squeezing me. I don't even think it's official, Alison. She thinks there's five of you. There's 11, ese. Why you gotta keep messing with my head like that? Not so tough, are ya? Huh? Safety's on. You were bluffing? Yeah. I learn from my mistakes, Alison. You're not going to shot me? Not accidentally. God, I hate this garage. This is how we take care of this family, from here on. That was quick. 
 
 Whoa! Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing, man?! I'm Donnie Hendrix and you've been harassing my wife! Hey, this is police business. My ass, it is. Beth Childs police business? How about Art Bell, suspended for doing far less than this. All these women, and you just can't put it together, can ya? I'm confused, too. Shh! You don't want to know what we know and, if you come near my home or my family again, I will bury you. Smile. Have a shitty day. [Rock music plays] [Hymn] ♪ (Oh oh) ♪

[Chuckle] I thought you like Mark. You don't get it, do you? M-my father is the father. I'm carrying your babies. My babies in your cervix? For your genes, Helena. Haven't you been listening to anything my father says? Not really. Okay, one adapted transcription algorithm. It was Susan's sterility concept... Degrade the endometrium, prevent ovarian follicles from maturing. Okay. Horrifying. Why an autoimmune condition? Why not tweak our hormones or modify our reproductive organs, somehow? Normal development was the prime directive. This was the least-invasive solution. Unfortunately, we didn't, uh, foresee the consequences. And... Key, meet code. Done. Thank you. Now, Cosima, we can begin the task of correcting my mistakes. How long will it take to decode the remaining sequences? Well, that depends on DYAD's intentions. Is that right? Yes. Each sequence has a distinct key and I have no intention of sharing them, just to allow DYAD the opportunity of perpetuating this experiment. No offense, Cosima. None taken. Hello, Gracie. Are you well? She has no idea. He puts babies in all these women? Mark: Yes. To multiply is divine. Try and eat something, Gracie. Please. Mmm. [Smooching] You love her like puppy. But you let him make her broodmare. The women here don't see it that way. Tell her, Gracie. Hmm. Marian. [Chuckle] You caught me reminiscing. Aldous certainly filled this room. Yes, he had a way. A heart attack on one of our jets. I'm bereft. Dr. Cormier is an interesting choice for the chair. She's telegenic. She has scope. And an intimate relationship with her subject. Always handy. How are you, Rachel? Besides bereft. You've learned a lot about yourself, lately. Tell topside that Rachel is fine. I know what our goals are and I've only just taken charge. I'm glad to hear it. But this is a personal call. Sarah Manning intrigues me. Doesn't she you? Biologically, yes. But it's not just her biology that's gotten her this far, is it? You were bred into this, given every advantage, but Sarah? Sarah's a product of chance, yet, here we are, at loggerheads with her. She's in hand, I assure you. Ethan: Pass me... please. Sorry, daddy. They're all gone. That's right. Sorry, love. They're just meant for us. Oh! That it outrageous! Well, I'm going to have to come after you and tickle you! Here I come, the tickle monster! Oh, no! Here we go! [Laughing] Oh, no! Now we're safe! What about poor daddy? I love you, too, daddy. What about poor daddy? I love you, too, daddy. Thank you, darling. [Laughs] They're just meant for us. Oh! That is outrageous! Stupid, stupid, stupid. Oh, no! Dr. Neilan. Yes, it's Rachel Duncan. I'm fine. Yes, of course. It's a terrible loss. But it's not why I'm calling. I need your expertise. You've done it. Well, not yet. But we have the marrow processing for transplant. Then thank you for letting me use your office. Oh. [Ring] [Ring] Martin, yes. Fine. [Alert beeps] Good. What time? Thank you. Bye. Okay, here you go. Good girl. Yuck. Yucky. Time to sleep, now, for a bit, yeah? There you go. What are you doing? I don't belong here. But, where will you go? To my sestra. You're a good girl, Grace. If you don't want to have my babies, don't have my babies. I would never do that. I'm coming with you. This way. It's faster. You disappoint me, daughter. Go back to your beds. No, father. We trusted you to counsel her, to help her embrace her purpose. I'm not afraid of you. Neither am I? Mother's gone out west to find more broodmares. Both of you can go to hell. Oh, Gracie. What would your mother say? Aah! [Gasp] Ah! Aah! Don't! No! Aah! I hate you! I hate you! Gracie. Leave her alone, Mark. She's got a lot of thinkin' to do. Mark! Come and help me with Helena. She's your daughter. Yes, Mark. You had to put your own child inside of her? You had to be the father, too?! Helena is a miracle, Mark. She defies the laws of science. It is a sign that I cannot ignore! You're not locking Gracie up anymore. Ohh! Uh! Uhh! Aaaah! Gracie. Arrgghh! Ah! Gracie. Gracie! Wait. Go! Run! Run! Come on. I've always wanted to do that. What? It's okay. I didn't put our initials in it. I have never been more attracted to you than I am right now. Unh! Take this off. Oh, yeah. The bedroom. No. Workbench. No no no! The freezer. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [Gasp] Mmm. I wanna be nasty. Come on, Donnie. Okay. Come on. Oh, yeah. Oh. Helena. Helena, what are you doing? Why do you sound so scared? Helena. We saved you. Mnh! Helena, I am the father of your children. They are going to need me when they get older. "Daddy, how do they make babies?" Would you like horse baby? [Sharp inhale] Cow baby. Is this how you do it? [Gasping] You've made your point. This isn't funny. Do I look like I'm trying to be funny? Helena. Helena! [Blows] Don't. Do this. [Gasp] No-o-o. Don't. Helena! Helena! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! [Cackling] Aaaaaaaaaaah! [Vital-signs monitor beeps] Hey, chicken. I don't know why... Delphine's here. She's outside. What's going on? I saw something about that man that works with you. Benjamin Kertland? I couldn't call. They could be listening. What is it? You must not overreact, or they will know. Tell me. Rachel may have compromised him. sh1t. S-Sarah. Sarah, wait! Be careful! What does she want? [Crisply] To warn us. Rachel's making a move. What kind of a move? I don't know! I'll be with Kira. You make sure the elevators are secure. Hi. Hi. Hey, hey. What's going on? We're not safe here. What are you talking about, eh? Where are you going to take her? [Ring] I don't know, yet. I'll let you know. sh1t. Pleasure to meet you, Felix. Where did you come from? Keep him away! He's with DYAD! What?! What are you talking about? I'm not with DYAD. Oh, my God. [Panicked sobbing] No! Fee! Fee! Fee! Oh, my God! Oh, Felix! Oh, sh1t! Oh, sh1t! He's been drugged. Felix! You! What did you do?! Nothing! [Crying] Sarah, it was you! It was a trick! Rachel's taken her! [Sob] Felix! Come on. Felix! [Vital-signs monitor beeps] What's wrong? [Crying] I made a terrible mistake. What have you done? [Sobbing] Mummy. Hello. My name is Rachel. How are you feeling, Kira? Where's my mum? Where's Mrs. S? Dear child... I know how frightening this must be for you. But, you'll get used to it. You may even grow to like it here. Just as I did.
