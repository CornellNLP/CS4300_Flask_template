 [ Music plays ] 
 [Chime] Huxley station. [English accent] sh1t. Sorry. Next stop: Huxley station. Next train to New York City will be departing on platform 8B in 10 minutes. Next train to New York City, platform 8B in 10 minutes. Hey, hey, it's Sarah. Yeah, I'm back in town. I want to see Kira, okay? [ Sobbing ] Well, that's not fair, is it? Can I at least speak to her? Hello? Bitch! Aah! [ Gasp ] Stop the train! Stop the train! Stop the train! May I have your attention, please. Due to an emergency -- Stand back. Move back! Get control down here, now! Elizabeth Childs. Two phones. [ Music plays ] [English accent] Oh, my God, you look like crap. [ Laughs ] Hi. Hello. No, but seriously. Ew. All right. How's life, Felix? This long, no see? You don't get to know. I didn't miss your birthday, did I? No. I know. It's totally pedestrian and the only reason I'm here. Oi, Bobby. Hey, Felix. Guinness? Yeah. How's Vic the dick? Yeah, I hit him first, this time. With an ashtray, so... He's a little blue. Coke? It's Vic's. Think you can flip it to one of your Bay Street blow boys? You have no idea what that costs me. I'll give you 20%. I wasn't talking about my cut, Sarah. I was talking about my pride. What are you up to? I'm here for Kira, Fe. After what happened, you really think Mrs S is going to let you take her? She's my daughter. She's going to have to. You've been gone almost a year, Sarah. I'm not judging. I'm just saying. All right? Ta. Yeah, so I'm back on the run, the usual Sarah shitestorm. Apparently. And on that note, something really weird just happened at the train station. What? I saw a girl kill herself. Ew! A jumper? Yeah, and she looked exactly like me, Felix. What you mean? Oh! You robbed the body. No, she left the bag on the platform. Isn't that essentially robbing her body? Okay, that's weird. Yeah, you think? Elizabeth Childs? It's you, with a nice haircut. And a nice address. What the hell, Fe? Did I have a twin sister? Well, now, when you're a poor little orphan foster wretch, anything's possible. Or so we tell ourselves. I'm going to go up to her flat. Yeah, to find out who she is or to rob the rest of her sh1t? No car. There has to be a car. [ Ring ] [ Ring ] Is that her phone? Yeah. Well, answer it. [ Ring ] [ Ring ] Try and get 20k for it, yeah? All right, fine. What about Vic? I'll call ya. Okay. Okay? Okay. Hello! Boyfriend. Squares. Paul Dierden. Out of town 'til Saturday. [ Music plays ] Well? sh1t for quality. I'll give you $10,000 for it. 10? With the hayroll? You can do better. [ Bang on door ] I'll think about it. Better think fast. [ Bang-bang ] Okay. [ Pounding ] Okay! sh1t! [ Pounding ] What? Where the hell is Sarah? sh1t, Vic! Where is she? Can't. Breathe. Oh! Sarah! Sarah?! What the hell is wrong with you? Where the hell is Sarah? Toodles. Where is she?! I don't know. I haven't seen her in, like, a year. She's been with you. Bullshit! She's not my problem anymore. Listen to me, Felix. I'm just going to ask you once -- Where. Is. The. Coke? Cocaine? Felix. [ Sigh ] All right, fine. Here. Blow me. [Chuckle] That's really funny. What the hell happened to your head? Well, let's see -- Sarah blindsided me, then she took off with the coke. Listen to me! Listen to me. Listen! I'm under hook with Pouchy. Look at me. You understand? Look at me! That's going to bring pain on me. 'Til I find her, it's on you. You mind if I have this? I'll be back. She better be here, fruitcake. Lovely to see you again, Victor. Sarah. It's "Beth". So my credit is maxed, but, I've got a sweet pad and my new boyfriend, Paul's, out of town for the weekend. Unfortunately, your real boyfriend, Vic the dick,  is already here. sh1t! Oh, I'm fine, by the way. Thank you. I'm sorry, Fe. Your blow is abysmal, by the way. I'll be lucky to get 10k for it. What? That's not enough. For what? To get out, Fe, set ourselves up with Kira somewhere. Sarah, who is Elizabeth Childs? I don't know. She's just a girl who looks like me. A girl with a pretty nice life. If it's so nice, why'd she kill herself? Hold on. Fe, she's got $75,000 in a savings account. Say again. 75k! The account was just opened, like, 3 weeks ago. That's enough to lose bloody Vic, yeah? We can get away with this, Fe, the three of us. Sarah, any second, someone's going to I.D. the body and it's game over, so you should really just drop it all right now. Nice work with the ashtray, by the way. Vic has stitches. Hello? I'm standing outside Huxley station right now -- Shut up. I'm thinking. As you can see, it's emptying out. Authorities have cleared out the station after an unidentified woman fell onto the tracks and was killed. Now, witnesses aren't sure how the woman came to be on the tracks or whether foul play was involved. Fe! -  Police have not released any more details. I have an idea. All right, give me a big smile. I want a big smile. Why are you shooting me right now? I love shooting you. Yeah yeah yeah. Mia: ♪ Live fast, die young ♪

Do not snap towels at me, Bobby. I had a very traumatic childhood. Yeah, hi. Um -- oh, totally awful -- apparently, a girl killed herself at Huxley station last night and I think I know her. Sarah. Sarah Manning. Beth? Hi! Good to see you again. How are you? Yeah, good, Stephen, thanks. Busy. I pred last week, at 2:14. It was only a half, but it almost killed me. How'd you do, your last charity run? I...don't know, in fact. I need to make a large withdrawal from that account. I see. Right, this is the one you just opened. Yeah, I'll leave $500 in, to keep the account open, but I need the rest, in cash, please. Cash? Yeah. I'd really recommend a cashier's check, if you... No, 50s and 100s, please. Well, we don't keep that much on hand. See, anything over $10,000, we have to special-order and that takes 2 to 4 business days. So... Stephen, what could I do to -- to push a rush on that? You know, 24 hours. Could I sponsor your next charity-run thing? You certainly can. Deal. [ Chuckle ] But... This card is -- I'm not even sure I've activated that yet. If I did, I need to repin it. Demagnetized, maybe? Yeah. You know what? Let's start with a new one and then we'll organize the withdrawal. Okay. Okay. Do you want access to your safe deposit box as well? Oh, yeah. I'd love that, Stephen. "Where are you? Must see you". Yeah, good luck with that. Alison Hendrix. Elizabeth Childs. Katja Obinger. [ Tires screech ] [ Siren chirps ] What the hell are you doing?! sh1t. Get in the car! Yeah -- no, thanks. Look, get the car, damn it! What's the charge? Don't, Beth, not today. We're late! Yeah. Okay, yeah. Calm down. [ Gasp ] Where were you? We were going to walk through it again. Uh, yeah, yeah. I got held up. [ Scoff ] Don't worry about it. I worry. Suddenly, you don't give a damn, I get pissed. My fat ass is on the line here, too. Now, you had better be ready. Are you ready?! Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready. You're sure as hell overdressed. Were you out all night, or something? No, you know what? Give me a second. I'll go in and change. Yeah, right. [Locks doors] You'd probably take off on me again. Look, Beth, I know this sh1t is as hard as it gets, but you got to stop making it worse. Art. Just...drive. Oh, is that her? Yes, yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Okay. Colin, um -- can I call you Colin? My mum does. Ah. Um, well, don't get me wrong -- I usually do enjoy creepy, I do, it's just, um, the air in here, is that just me? Because it smells like -- Uh, no, it's death. You can do this, though. It can be a Gestalt. Oh, my. Holy shite. Let's go. Hey, good luck, Beth. "Fashionably late," you call that? She's here, lieutenant. You get busy. Detective, come with me. Show's over! Oh. [ Sigh ] Stick to your statement and you'll be fine, okay? I got to -- I got to use the washroom. Lieutenant. All right. Get yourself sorted. Detective. Yeah. Washroom's this way. Right. Felix? Beth is a cop. I'm a cop, Felix. Abort. This will be shocking, Felix, but, for her, it was instant. Okay? Okay. Oh, my God! I -- Oh! That's -- that -- that's so -- All right, I can't. I can't do it. You got -- I need to -- That's too messed up. I can't. It's okay. You can lean on me. All right. Thank you. Morgue water. Delicious. Is it her? Yeah. Your sister. I'm very sorry. Foster sister. But we were very close. You know, we spent all our, um, formative years together. Right. Okay, well, there's a few things you need to sign. But if you -- if you need -- want -- anyone to talk to, you know, over a drink or... Well, aren't you an odd duck. All right, statement of officer Elizabeth Childs, entering into record her version of the line-of-duty shooting, 7 October of this year, resulting in a civilian fatality, one Margaret Chen. In your own words, please. Begin by stating your name. Anytime, detective. [ Gasp ] I panicked. What do you want me to say? Pretty much anything but "I panicked." I'm kidding. Where's your wit gone? You haven't called me "dipshit" all day. You don't have to babysit me, dipshit. I know. But who else would? 
 
 Woman: Thanks, doc. See you next week. Look, Beth, I know this thing has got you all twisted up, but you got to forgive yourself. Shootings happen. To whoever's there with the gun in their hand. [ Ring ] Dr. Bowers will see you now. [ Music plays softly ] [ Pounding on door ] Felix, open the goddamn door! Felix, I know you're in there! Open the door, now! Ooh! You b*st*rd. What the hell is wrong with you? Huh? Where's Sarah? Sarah's dead. [Chuckle] I'm sorry, what? She's dead. Vic. [Crying] She killed herself. Yeah? Bullshit. Where is she, Felix? She jumped in front of a train because you are such an arsehole! What's this? Her death certificate. Bullshit. It's not real. I identified her body. Vic, she's dead, she's gone! Okay, Felix, stop. Stop! Stop it! She told you to say this? She's not dead. Where is she? [ Crying ] Stupid bitch. Sarah. [ Sobbing ] It's not coming back to you? Hmm, no, not really. Uh, I know I shot a civilian. Maggie Chen, 44, single, churchgoer. I'm just missing -- Missing what? Explain. Uh... Myself? Um -- Yeah, I'm -- I glitched, break, or something. I think I need some, you know, leave. You're under suspension. Right. Ahem! See, I'm having trouble with detail, so I'm not sure I should say anything at all. It's okay. I's all confidential. Have you shared any of these dissociations with Paul? Yeah, no, we're fine. I don't want to talk about Paul. Paul's away. No, he's in Cleveland. Beth, uh, a waitress makes a mistake at work. She, what? Drops a plate of meatloaf, doesn't get a tip. Try to separate "mistake" from "result." Getting back on the job, for you, is all about moving forward from a moment you can never take back. You  need  to talk to me about that moment. About seeing cell phone and reacting "gun". Mm-hmm. Can I make another appointment? [ Beep ] So, your twin, all hopped up on cop tranquilizers, guns down an innocent Chinese lady holding a cell phone in her hand. Is that true? I don't know. I'm not even sure her partner knows. Feels like she's lying about something. With 75 grand in a new account? She's well dodgy. Yeah, whatever she was into, it drove her bloody nuts, yeah? Yeah, suicide's thrilling, agreed. But, can we get the elephant out of the room? What? Well, look at her. What? You're related. This could be your story. It's not. Every foster kid dreams of their lost family. Oh, my God. Deep down, we all hope we're special. Yeah, the last thing I am is special. If that was my boyfriend, I'd jump in front of a train, too. Don't say that. Paul's hot and you know it. Oh, Vic is keening like a banshee. He wants a funeral. You can't have a funeral. The whole sad point is nobody would notice if I died. What's this? Birth certificates? Alison Hendrix, Beth. Katja Obinger. Born in Berlin. Sarah, their birth dates are all within a month of yours. It's a coincidence. I don't care. It's just a score, Fe. Let me finish what I started and then I'll come back for you and Kira, yeah? Oh. You're going to disappear again? Yeah, I have to, Fe. There's dangerous sh1t in this life. Somebody keeps texting her. Oh, texting. My God, how terrifying. Look, Fe, sell the coke and keep half the money and give the other half to Kira, yeah? You left Kira with Mrs S overnight and you didn't come back for 10 months! I'm trying to fix it. Tell it to the angels, Sarah. You're already dead. [ Key turns ] sh1t! Beth! Beth. Hi. Hey. The clash? Oh, yeah. Uh -- "London Calling." The clash rock. [Chuckle] Yeah, but you don't. Are you going somewhere? Uh... Uh...no. Just gym stuff. Weren't you coming back on the weekend? Well, I wanted to be here. So? Yeah? How was the hearing? Oh. Uh, I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. You skipped it? No, um -- I...got sick to my stomach. I basically puked on them. Are you serious? Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry. I'm okay. Beth, what's happened? A lot. Yeah, I know, but you're -- I'm what? What'd you do to your hair? Uh...nothing. I got it cut. It's longer. It's just wet. Something's different. Bedroom. Ah! Ah! Right here. [ Gasping ] [ Pounding on door ] [Plaintively] Felix. For crying out loud. Felix. [ Opera plays ] I'm sorry, man. I don't know where else to go. The men's shelter? What the hell happened to your face? I got in a fight. Why, Vic? Why are you such a dick? I don't know. I'm angry. Can I come in? No! Thanks. I can't sleep. I keep seeing her face. Yeah, me too. Her pretty face. Felix, you and me, we have to do something. There's just no goddamn closure, bro. We have to have, like, a... a memorial sendoff, or something. Okay, Vic. We'll have a wake. Really? See, that's what I'm talking about, man, coming together. [Sniffle] Yeah. Cremation's today. I'm buying. Oh, sh1t. Yeah, it can't be today. I got to call Glenn and that bitch Sherry and all her Montreal connects are going to want to be there. No no, locals only, Vic. Fast and light, all right? It's going to be an intimate memorial pissup. Okay. Come on, let's go. Can I...? Okay! That's -- Thank you. All right, um -- you know what? First, though, you need a shower and a Xanax. [Crying] Okay. Mmm. Ah! Oh. For real? That was amazing. Was it? We haven't had that action for, like, 2 years. Uh, I got up for the gym, Paul. Okay. Well, you want to tell me what happened at the hearing? Uh, I choked, I guess. They reconvene in a couple days. Don't worry about it. Beth. Hmm? What? Are you back on the meds? No. Then you didn't choke. You're just finally feeling something. Feeling like the real you. I got up for the gym. Are you driving today? What? Can I borrow the keys to your car? Use your own car. I can't find my keys. Did you check the thing where they always are? Yeah. Yeah, I checked the thing where they always are. Mm. [Sigh] Okay. [ Alarm chirps ] Nice. Felix! We can't part angry this time. It's not good for your skin, okay? Call me, or I'll squeeze your bloody bollocks in a vise, you little -- Everything all right? Yeah. Obnoxious English relative. Oh. Well, I've got your cash. I just need your signature here. Okay. Right, then. All done. Here. Okay. Good luck with that run. Fe? Felix. You little sh1t. Sarah had a big heart. It was always fight or flight with her. You guys remember how she was, right? This is all based on facts. She was the kind of person you want to hang on to, but she would not be held, would she? Sarah, I'm sorry. I know I have a lot to answer for. [ Musical ringtone ] My favorite moment -- So,  is it heaven or hell? I didn't want a funeral, for this very reason, Fe. Well, you can't do much about that when you're dead, can you? I'm watching right now. Really? Oh, well. Pathetic. Let me ask you -- I dressed Vic. How do we look? Yeah, not as good as Rockabilly Bob. I know! Still Rockabilly, after all these years. Got to respect that. Vic: I want to say she was like an angel that was put on earth -- Sherry's upset, though, in't she? Oh, yeah, she thinks Vic pushed you in front of the train. It's priceless, really. Eh, I got the money, Fe. I still want us to be together. It can work, yeah? This is our chance, for me, you, and Kira to start over. Sarah, I -- Felix, do you mind?! I'm trying to -- Do you want us to go and come back? sh1t. I'm sorry, I -- Vic's getting mad. I got to go. Could you hang up your phone? Oh, sh1t! What? Mrs S is there, Fe. sh1t. Stop! Stop! Stop! Oh, sh1t. No no no, Fe. Oh, sh1t! Ohh. [Crying] No Fe, Kira's there. Uh -- she can't think I'm dead, Fe. Fe? Oh, my God, she can't think I'm dead. [ Gasp ] Beth. Beth, why don't you respond to me? [ Wheeze ] Beth. Just keep away from me. Beth, it's Katja. Oh, my God. Holy sh1t. Why no meeting, Beth? What happening? Uh -- I brought the briefcase,  ja? The sample for your friend, Beth. I was careful, like you said. Yeah, just stay back. I'm Katja. Katja Obinger, Beth. Yeah, I get it, the German, okay? I've seen your birth certificate. Ja,  you asked for it, for proof. [ Coughing ] Please, I need to see your scientist friend, Beth. Uh, I can't help you. Get out of the car! Why are you doing this? Your partner, he was following you. You were the one in the black car? The open that flashed your lights. Ja. You need to go. You're police, Beth. We need you. Don't! Get out. Just one. I'm a few. No family, too. Who am I? You are not Beth. [ Gasping ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gasping ] [ Gunshot ] Aah! [ Screech ] Oh, God! sh1t! sh1t! [ Ringtone ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] sh1t! [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] sh1t. [ Ring ] Hello. This is not Sarah. It's not Sarah. We've been here before. No, Paul, we definitely haven't been here before. sh1t! Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, take it easy! Are you wearing a wire? When is mummy coming? Sarah! Sarah! Aah!
