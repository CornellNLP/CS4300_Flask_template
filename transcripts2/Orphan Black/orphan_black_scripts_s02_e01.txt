 I saw a girl kill herself. 
 Ew! 
 Yeah, and she looked exactly like me. 
 We're clones. We're like lab rats in an illegal experiment. 
 If it were my experiment, I would put an observer close to the subject to keep tabs and accumulate data. 
 Where is Beth? 
 She killed herself. 
 I took her identity. You're her monitor, aren't you? 
 Doctors came and medically examined her in her sleep. 
 I know exactly who you are. You're a... 
 A sleazy watcher spy! 
 (Choking) 
 (Garburator running) 
 Aynsley? 
 The German was sick. Should I be worried about that? 
 (Coughing) I'm sick, Delphine. 
 Art, you gotta see this. 
 It's a match on the Jane Doe print. 
 Why the hell does she look like Beth? 
 Sarah Manning! Put your hands on your head! You're under arrest. 
 I didn't kill her, Art! 
 Do you know who did? 
 Detective, this interview is over. 
 This is Amelia. 
 I'm your birth mother. 
 I had twins. One to the state, and one to the church. 
 Helena. 
 I grew up pure in a convent in Ukraine. 
 You killed someone I've been dreaming about my whole life. 
 (Gunshots) 
 Sarah Manning. 
 My name is Rachel Duncan, and we are going to come to terms. 
 Sarah? You can't make a deal. 
 Any freedom they promise is bullshit. 
 They've patented us. 
 Sarah, they could claim Kira. 
 Kira! 
 Pick up, pick up. 
 Leave it for Felix. Fee! sh1t. Fee, where are you? They took 'em. They took Kira and Mrs. S. (Thunder) (Door chiming) (Folk music playing) You look like you could use a coffee. Yeah, I'll take tea. Tea it is. (Operator): The number you have reached is not in service at this time. sh1t! The number you have reached is not in service at this time. Hi, you've reached Paul Dierden. Please leave a message. Paul, what the hell is going on? Did Rachel just take my family? I need you to call me now. Nah, first one's on the house. Thanks. I appreciate that. (Phone ringing) Paul? Hello, Sarah. There is a painless way to reunite with Siobhan and Kira. Simply surrender yourself. Rachel, you bitch. Me and Kira are not your bloody subjects. Neither is Siobhan. The terms of my offer still stand. We'll pretend you didn't run. Rachel, if you touch one hair on my daughter's head, I will... (Door chiming) Evenin'. Evenin', fellas. What can I get ya? Are your eggs the domesticated type? What do you mean? I believe my friend is asking for free-range eggs. Undomesticated. No free-range, no free-run. Just normal eggs. Then they're not normal. Your chickens have been interfered with. They're not my chickens; they're just my eggs. I bet you ordered up a whole mess of eggs. Who are you? She's got the lilt. Yeah. This is the one. Uh-uh-uh. After you. I think we'll let the lady leave on her own. Ease on out now. Are you sure, Sarah? We've come here to take you to Kira. Where is she? Sarah! Sarah! There's nowhere to run! Sarah! sh1t. We're your best option. Ah! (Thunder) So, tonight  you should be extra sweet to me. Fee! Holy sh1t! Hi! Where have you been? Bloody hell, what? What are you doing? - Is this why you haven't answered your phone? Yeah, 'cause I'm in the midst of a five-way. We have an emergency, and you're high. You're kidding me! What are you wearing? What? Sarah, what? They took Kira! Mrs. S' truck was still there; her purse. The place was trashed like they'd been dragged out... Ok, wait, can we just, can we back up a sec, ok? No, we need to go, Fee! How do we know that this isn't Helena again, Sarah? No, she's gone. She's gone where? Just gone, ok? (Phone ringing) sh1t! Ok. Wait, wait, wait! Wait. You said all their other phones have been disconnected. Well, why isn't yours disconnected, yeah? Probably because they're tracking that stupid pink burner. Yeah, you're probably right. Hello? Hello? It's Paul, Sarah. Who else is listening? You know my situation. Tell 'em I want to talk to Mrs. S. You're going to have to come in for that. I don't see a better choice, Sarah. I'll meet you alone. Wait for my call. She's smarter than you think. Do one more thing to help her so I can put a bullet in your head. No, no. You can't meet Paul. No. No, not in person, no. No. What... Hey, ow! sh1t. Sorry, sorry. Ok. Come on, get your sh1t together, you silly tit. I need you to make a side trip for me, yeah? (Music playing quietly) Please just... Come to the Dyad event. Hey, think what you're asking me to do. We can negotiate your position, but you need to start talking to Leekie. (Sigh) We need the Dyad now. We? You. If you are sick. And our relationship can be whatever we want. We have leverage. You still work for Leekie. On your behalf, to protect you. These samples aren't gonna go to Dyad, and you can't tell them that we know about the patent either. I'd do my own research first. This is my biology, it's my decision. Ok? Ok. You're right. (Knocking on door) (Knocking on door) What the dickens? Rachel took Kira? She can't do that. We agreed to a code of conduct. Yeah, well, Sarah didn't sign a deal, did she? Shh, shh. Sorry. I was supposed to ask you something, but I just... Oh, can we borrow a gun? Oh, right, you need a gun. Apparently I'm the go-to girl for guns, right? Ok, Alison, come here. We... Holy sh1t. What is with the balls of your thumbs? They're so bouncy. Felix, are you high? Well, I didn't know there was gonna be a huge emergency, did I? Be quiet. My children are sleeping. Look, I do not keep guns in my house anymore; They're at the range in my locker. Could you maybe just go and fetch us one, please? Sarah can't... Just go around shooting people with my guns, they're registered to me. I'm trying to get my family life back in order. I'm not drinking anymore, no more... Little helpers. I'm doing a musical. Oh, my God, not Cats. (Knocking on door) (Donnie): Alison? Oh, my God. Hello, Donnie. (She clears her throat.) Who are you talking to? Um... I'm... I'm running lines for the play, obviously. At 4 A.M? I'm not in control of the muse. The muse? Mm-hmm. You wouldn't understand. No, I don't think so. Just go to bed. Fine. Don't be long. Ok. (Felix squeaking): Ahh, ahh! What are you wearing? Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no. Look, I might be able to help with a firearm... Unregistered. Seriously? Yes. I have a friend. Let's call him Ramon. You know a gun dealer named Ramon? He's a gun enthusiast. He has many jobs, he's very hardworking. Ok. Tell Sarah to meet me at Glendale Community Theater, 4 PM. Ja, die meisten der Patente wurden direkt nach der Entscheidung des Supreme Court eingereicht werden. Ja, sicher. Vielen Dank, Herr Schlessinger. (Phone ringing) Paul here. Here's how this is gonna work. You Paul? Yeah. Twenty bucks. (Phone ringing) Can't trust anyone these days. I knew they'd be all over you. Yeah, you got about 30 seconds. Ok, well, now that nobody's listening, where exactly are they? All they gave me is a message from Rachel. Tomorrow morning, she's getting on a private plane, with Kira. You could be on that plane with them or not. What? She's just a child, Paul. How can they use her as leverage? Sarah, I can't tell you what to do, but Tonight there's a big event at the Dyad. Rachel will be there. Ok, what else? She's, uh, Insulated. Daniel rarely leaves her side. But now he's tasked with bringing you back. He's coming after you. She says, "up yours." Hey, can I borrow your phone? Can I touch your boob? Cheeky. (Phone beep) It's like I don't see what good a gun is gonna do. She's planning on gate-crashing. I don't have a plan yet. Cosima, where's Delphine? At the Dyad, getting ready. She wants me to go to this thing. Maybe I should. I smell lesbians in my bed last night. Look, I'm not gonna apologize for my heart, ok? But I promise both of you guys that I'm not gonna get fooled again. Why don't I talk to them, Sarah? No, no, no, no. Just sit tight, ok? I'll feel better when I have a gun. This is totally crazy. Oh. Morning, Mrs. Hendrix. Hello, Ramon. Did I catch you on a break? Oh, customer service never takes a break at Econo-mart. So, uh... Avomax? Zaraphen? Something between A and Z? No, thank you. I'm actually taking a break. Oh. Mmm. Kickin' it natural? Uh, no. No, no, no. Not interested in natural either. I have a... I have a friend who needs a piece. Maker. Mrs. Hendrix. I have a nice selection. All clean, numbers filed. I've you like a revolver, this 45 is a, uh... Pretty badass. Matte black. Is that a... Lady grip? Hot. Practical. Mmm. Thank you, Ramon. So, how's your mother? Hey, um, one subject is showing fresh symptoms. Do you think you could  take a closer look at their profile for me? You mean the one with some kind of synthetic sequence you refuse to explain? Yeah, that one. No, I can't, because I'm sending you a new blood sample. Dr. Cormier. Dr. Leekie asked me to escort you upstairs as soon as you arrived. Of course. Is there something going on I should know about? Where is Cosima, Delphine? Exactly where you want her: here in town, considering your employment offer. Be careful playing for the other team, Delphine. Cosima is scared of us. She's seen how you've persecuted Sarah. Sarah is not your subject. You're a eugenicist, Dr. Cormier. Is that a dirty word for you as a scientist? No. I want Cosima here, full time, starting tonight. So do I. 324B21 is showing the same respiratory symptoms as the other two. Congratulations. I'm invested, which I'm sure is what you wanted. (People trumpeting their lips) Ok, people, listen up. Let's gather. Everyone, let's gather. Circle, please. Hands. Troupe, in three days, we move to the main stage for dress rehearsal. In four days, we open. Losing Aynsley is... (He sighs.) Heartbreaking. But we are not civilians; this is the theater, and we all know that the show must go on. So... Kelsey is going to be stepping out of the wings to play Laura. Um... Excuse me. I'm your Laura. No, Ali. (He sighs.) We all know how close you are to this. But you have rehearsed with Aynsley, you know the part. We want you to play Sheila. You want me to be the lead? Yes. 
 
 Give it up. (Applause) You can do this. Ok. Show them, hmm? Shine. Ok, people, let's all shine onstage. Let's pick it up from the point where everyone helps Sheila clean up after the unfortunate death. All right? Mop. Mop. ♪ Lovely ♪ Stop crying, Carter. Deep breath. ♪ One, two, three, four. ♪ 
♪ And we will sing, sing, sing away the hours ♪ 
♪ shout till our throats are sore ♪ 
♪ and we will raise our voices to the heavens ♪ 
♪ God himself will hear our mighty roar ♪ 
♪ and we will wipe, wipe, wipe away the plasma ♪ 
♪ scrub off every stain♪ 
♪ since I cannot control my asthma ♪ 
♪ I'll stand by to entertain ♪ (Inhaling) Yes. Brava! Bravissima! (Police radio chatter) Alison Hendrix is in a musical. What? What musical? It ain't Cats. I think she's playing the lead. Beth's dead, German's dead, Sarah Manning gets sprung on the cusp of confessing, and we're left with Alison Hendrix, model citizen and thespian. Yeah. Yeah. You're kidding me. It's her. Oh, sh1t. We're not supposed to be on this thing, Angie. Damn it. Hey, long time no see. sh1t. Sarah... Don't run. Come on. What do you want with Alison Hendrix? I just told you. They killed a man right in front of me, Art. Hey, I'm talking to you. Tell me what you are to each other, to Beth. We don't know. That's the whole point. The diner, sounds like the two bodies that Grigson and Diaz caught this morning. I know. She probably does too. Yeah, those are the people behind it. The same ones that got me out of jail. She's making this stuff up. Then arrest me. You can't, can you? Huh? Just come on. Come on. Let's go check her story out. (Speaking quietly) It's a fortunate position you find yourself in, Paul. How is that, Miss Duncan? You're the only one who seems to know what makes Sarah tick. I need your office this evening. It's the Koreas. Both of them. Ah. Well, good. Congratulations. Paul, have you ever been to Taiwan? Taiwan, no. I don't suppose you speak Mandarin? No. Hm, pity. Pack a bag. We leave Tuesday. Good luck, Paul. Keeping him up close and personal? Of course. Rachel, did you seriously kidnap Sarah's people? The less you know about it, the better. The child may be a biological goldmine, but so is her mother. Daniel will recover Sarah. Is that really necessary? Yes. And not your concern. We have a big evening. You need to be on point. "To combine is to create; to engineer, divine." You'll do wonderfully, Aldous. Come on, just go check it out. She probably dropped those bodies herself. They have my daughter, Art. Hey. So, what's up? Oh, best shooting we caught  in two years, and the federals walked in. Check it out. How you doin', Ange? So, what happened? George Hudson, line cook. Forty-five to the sixth chakra. Cowboy was still waiting, but shotgun to the midsection. What chakra is that? Uh, somewhere between the third and the fourth. There's a possible eyewitness. A tea drinker. A tea drinker? Yeah, digs out a wall, escapes out the back. Ok. Thanks, man. Sarah, if your daughter's missing, we'll put out an Amber alert. These people are powerful. They got me out of jail. You can't do anything. Just let me go, please. Just before the lawyer showed up, you were about to tell me everything, what this really is. You don't want to know everything, Art. You don't want Angie to know anything. Feds took over the scene from Grigson and Diaz. Which feds? I didn't get an acronym. Seriously? We're off the case. It doesn't exist, Angie. You want to walk her in there and hand her over, you go right ahead. Come on, you. Thank you. "Thank you?" You miss us? You miss Beth's life, you little grifter? Piss off. She almost trusts me, Angie. No, I'm not letting you turn yourself over to neolutionists. What am I meant to do, Fee? Hey? If Rachel's got Kira on a plane, I have to be with her. Look, look, Sarah, Delphine put me on the list for the Dyad tonight, ok? I can go in there and, like, demand that Rachel let them go. Rachel doesn't take demands, Cosima. That's why I needed the bloody gun. (Knocking on door) Anybody in the house? It's Ramon. Ramon? Delivery from Mrs. Hendrix. Well, those are so Alison. It's what inside that counts. Huh? Am I wrong, sailor? Whoa. Ah. Seriously, Sarah? What good is that gonna do? Alison, you know some very strange people. Oh, they look nice. Sorry I couldn't bring them in person. I have scads of costumes to alter. Hey, thanks for the card too. Are you making fun of me? I made that! No, no, no, no. It's good to see you, Alison. We love you, Alison. Well, normally I'd say don't do anything rash, but rash seems to be a genetic trait, so... Go get Kira. Believe me, right now is the time to resist our predisposition to impulsive behavior. We need a plan. You don't have a plan? No, the plan's a bit of an issue. Hey, I know where Rachel is. That's enough. Sarah, what are you gonna do? Walk into the Dyad with a gun and just start shooting people? Yeah. Uh, tut-tut-tut-tut. I don't want to know anything. Leave me out of it. (Sigh) Plausible deniability. Yeah, sure. I have to be at Sara Stubbs at 9 PM to do a fitting and run lines, so... Break a leg, Sarah. Thanks again. This thing at the Dyad, it's, like, a big deal, yeah? Yeah, big pharma, big agro, VIPs, security. That's good, that's good. That will be helpful. They'll be busy. Ok, what are you on to? (Sarah sighs.) Plausible deniability. Oh, no. No, it's easiest just to give Rachel what she wants, yeah? Me. Just not how she's expecting it. Ok, even if I agree with what I think you're thinking, how do you next to Rachel with Daniel in the way? (Sarah sighs.) Alison's not gonna like it. (Phone vibrating) Paul Dierden. Paul, it's Sarah. Let me speak to her. She wants Rachel. Hi, Sarah. This is Daniel. I speak for Rachel. I'm ready to make a deal, face to face. Well, Rachel's a very busy woman, but if you tell me where you are, I'll bring you to her. All right. I'll meet you At 9 PM. I'll be driving the red minivan. Ah! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Let go! Ugh! Ugh! (Yelling in pain) (Whistle blown) (Whistle blown) Ah! Ah! Who in the hell are you? This is unacceptable. I need to talk to Dr. Leekie right away. That won't be necessary, ma'am. This is our mistake. It won't happen again. (Amiable chatter) Thank you. Elise! Shite. (Delphine): Cosima. Hey. You came. You won't regret this. I promise. Aldous! Look who it is. Uh, no, no. No, no, no, come, come, come. Mon adversaire. I wasn't as sure  as Delphine that you'd come. Here I am. Um, doesn't mean I'm gonna sign your contract, though. A starting point. We're in uncharted waters. Really, it's all up to you. Ok. Then I want my own lab. (Announcement): In a moment, Dr. Leekie will be welcoming you to the Dyad Institute. Please stand by. That's my cue. Cosima... This is the best place you could be right now. Thank you, Dr. Leekie. (He chuckles.) Enjoy yourself. Mm. You're Sarah. Yeah, nice to meet you too. Does Cosima know you're doing this? Depends if I get caught. Now, where are Kira and Siobhan? What? Don't play stupid. Rachel kidnapped my family. Where are they? How would I know? I've never even seen Rachel. I've seen her. And if you want to keep Cosima out of this, you're gonna tell me where she is. Ok. There is serious business going on right now behind the scenes, and so my guess is that she's using Leekie's wing. Where is that? Down there. It's impossible to get down there. You need a specific swipe card for the 10th floor. Like this? You're going to get yourself killed. Miss Cormier? (Delphine gasps.) (Announcement): Please welcome Dr. Leekie. (Applause) Thank you, everyone. I am Dr. Aldous Leekie, director of the Dyad Institute, and it is my great pleasure to welcome you here on behalf of the entire Dyad group of companies. The keystone... (Beep) of the original Dyad Institute was set here in 1918. (Applause) Today, worldwide, the overwhelming majority of bio tech research is funded by private capital,  and today, the Dyad Group  spans the globe. We employ 27,000 souls in 134 countries,  including Vatican City. (Applause) The age of biotechnology is upon us. It is the moral responsibility of visionaries like us to continue healing, feeding, and fueling  the future of humanity. (Applause) The recent supreme court decision... (Man translating into Korean) Characterizing the legal status of natural versus synthetic DNA was the successful result of our lobbying strategies. (Man translating into Korean) We are proceeding with the next tranche of patent claims. (Man speaking Korean) Good, you made it. I want my daughter. Of course, and we want you to be together, but my people found your foster mother's house overturned. They were gone when we got there. You're lying. I lied to get you here. But we don't have them. Kira's here, and I want to see her now. You're not going to shoot me, Sarah. (Gunshot) If you don't have her, you're dead! There are other forces vying for our fate, Sarah. We'll get Kira back together. Nobody lays hands on me. You don't own us. (Gun loaded) Sarah, put it down. Where is Kira? They don't have her. They were playing me too. Now lower the gun. And what are you, her bodyguard now? It's you they want. It is over, Sarah. Turn around. In the face. Sorry. Go. I'll figure out something to tell 'em. Hey, it's me. Jesus Christ. You are like a bad smell. Look, I didn't know where else to go. Maggie Chen? What, you're not having one? I want it straight up. (She sighs.) It wasn't them, Art, the Dyad people. Somebody else took Kira. I know. What? The feds are calling the diner thing domestic terrorism. The cowboy that took the shotgun blast was a religious extremist, like Maggie Chen, a prolethean. Helena's people. Why don't we start with that? Who is Helena? Are you sure you want to know what this is all about? I guess we'll find out. Excuse me. (Breathing with difficulty) My sestra shot me. I need some help here! Trauma team! Ok, no, we need a nurse here right now. Gunshot wound. Call it in, call it in! Pressure! Gunshot through the back. Get her up. Ready? Now. We need to get her in... Move it! Look at the camera. Shot point-blank in the chest and she walks in? How is she even alive? We remember Aynsley's warmth. I killed Aynsley! I watched it happen, Felix. They didn't do anything about it. The old wing is where our most sensitive research takes place. So, this is where you keep the clones. Rachel takes insult very personally. Would you leave us, please? Yes, of course. Kira? Hello? They're gone. Young girl matching Kira's description with some guy. I said get your hands on the car. You're gonna regret this.
