 [MUSIC] 
 [ROARS] 
 [NARRATOR READING] 
 [KION READING] 
 [SNIFFING] 
 Hmm. 
 Now I got ya. 
 [LAUGHING] 
 Sorry, couldn't help myself. 
 How'd you find me? 
 Mom's been teaching me how to track by scent. 
 Pretty good, huh? 
 Or pretty lucky! 
 [BOTH LAUGHING] 
 She's never found him that quickly before. 
 Her tracking skills are improving. 
 They do seem evenly matched. 
 And that means they're ready. 
 Today's the day. 
 Ha! Missed again. 
 Nala : Ahem. 
 Mom! Dad! 
 I caught him faster than ever this time. 
 Only because I let you. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 You gonna "let" me pin you, too? 
 [KION GRUNTS] 
 Okay, okay. 
 That's enough, you two. 
 [KIARA LAUGHS] 
 [BLOWS RASPBERRY] 
 Nala : I have a surprise for you. 
 You're both coming with me on the Trail to Udugu. 
 The Trail to Udugu? 
 Where's Udugu? I've never heard of it. 
 Is it in the Pride Lands? [CHUCKLES] 
 You'll see. 
 Taking the Trail to Udugu is an important part of growing up in the royal family. 
 And all royal siblings make the journey when they're ready. 
 Did you go on it, Dad? 
 I never had the chance. 
 I don't have a brother or sister. 
 And don't worry about your Lion Guard duties, Kion. 
 While you're gone, I will be leading the Guard. 
 You will? 
 Perhaps your friends could learn a thing or two from their King. 
 Uh, sure. 
 I know Bunga will love it. 
 Fuli : Simba? 
 His Royal Highness? 
 Leading the Lion Guard? 
 Un-Bunga-lievable! 
 Don't get too used to him. 
 See you when I'm back from Udugu. 
 Good luck. Bye, Kion! 
 Bye. See you soon! 
  Poa! 
 The King and us! 
 [SIGHS] I'm not worried. 
 He's just like Kion, but bigger. 
 How can you be so calm? 
 His Majesty could be here any moment. 
 [GASPS] My feathers! 
 I need to clean up. 
 [PREENING NERVOUSLY] 
  Hapana! 
 The whole lair's a mess! 
 Relax, Ono! 
 I know Simba pretty well. 
 And you've got nothing to worry about. 
 Let me tell ya what he's like.

♪ When you're running with the King ♪ Ahem. Oh... [CHUCKLES] Hey there, Simba. Um, uh, Your Highness. Ono : Sir. Beshte and Fuli : Your Majesty. Hello, Lion Guard. I will admit, Bunga did get one thing right in his... ...performance. The way you walk? Your smile? Your fabulously groomed mane? Uh, no. I am excited to lead the Lion Guard. Now, first things first. Are we ready for morning patrol? Yes, sir! Definitely! Affirmative! Uh... Your Majesty. Then let's move out. Lion Guard, follow me. You heard him, let's go! Nala : This is nice. It's been so long since the three of us have spent some time together. What do you think's waiting for us in Udugu? Maybe a bunch of animals who want to meet their future Queen... And her little brother. "Little brother?" I'm leader of the Lion Guard! If they'd wanna meet anyone, it's me. We'll see about that. Race ya! You're gonna lose. I run with Fuli every day. I'll get to Udugu first! Oh, no, you won't! [GRUNTING] You two could compete over anything, couldn't you? Both : Yes! [SIGHS] At least you agree on that. Come on. We have a long way to go. [EAGLE SCREECHING] Ono : Uh, Your Majesty? Yes, Ono? Well, it's not a big deal... But, uh... Ono's trying to say that on morning patrol, Kion usually goes this way. Is that so? And is Kion here? No, sir. You heard the King. We'll go this way for a change. It'll be fun. Yes. "Fun." Mom, how much longer will it take to get to Udugu? That's a tough question. Udugu isn't easy to find. Don't worry, I'll find it. I'm a better tracker than you. We'll see about that! [BOTH LAUGHING] You really think you can find Udugu before me? Just watch me. Kion, Kiara, be careful! [BOTH GASP] I got you. Thanks, Mom. Thanks. That is definitely not the way to find Udugu. [RUMBLING IN DISTANCE] [GASPS] Ono : Hapana! Everyone, look! A... A mud slide! Straight ahead! Uh, yes, sire. Ono : And the mud's headed right for... The ostrich herd's nest! If we don't move fast, the mud will sweep the eggs off the cliff! Affirmative. I was just about to say that. We'll have to act fast. I'll move that log, so it diverts the mud away from the nest! What should we do? Just stick together and follow me. Just stick together and follow him? That's what he said. And he is the King. Our eggs! Our eggs! This way, Lion Guard! Jump from rock to rock! Uh, jump from rock to rock? Usually, Kion just has me run through the mud. Yeah, but Kion's not in charge right now. Simba is. Lion Guard, come on! And it sounds like he really wants us to follow him. Just try your best? Okay. Here goes.  Twende Kiboko! Oh! [BUNGA GRUNTS] Whoa! [FULI YELPS] There. That should do the trick. Now let's continue our patrol. Lion Guard, follow me! [ALL SCREAMING] We're gonna hit the log! Lion Guard, the log! It's rolling towards the nest! I'll grab the eggs! [GRUNTS] Or maybe I won't. There's too much mud. I can't fly. I got this. [GRUNTING] Good thinking, Big B! Now the log's not gonna roll over the eggs. But the log was protecting the eggs from the mud. Oh, no! [GASPS] Grab the eggs! [GASPS] We missed one! I have it! Ostriches, your eggs are safe. Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you. To think our eggs were personally saved by the King! What an honor! It was my pleasure, Mbuni. So, our first mission was a success. Uh, yes, Your Majesty. Yeah! Yep. Affirmative. Kion : Is this really the trail to Udugu? Nala : It is. If you tell us where Udugu is, I bet I can find an easier path. There is no easy path to Udugu. But there is a way to get through all these thorns without a scratch. See? Yeah! I can crawl under the branches to get through the thorns. Ow. [GRUNTS] Ouch! That wasn't exactly what I meant. [CHUCKLES] Of course not. Over the thorns is the way to go. [GRUNTS] Whoa! Ouch! I don't think either of you is understanding me. What's wrong, Kiara? Isn't your... [GRUNTING] ...plan working? I'm... Ow! ...fine. I know exactly... [YELPS] ...what I'm doing. I hope they make it. This is definitely... [GRUNTS] ...the right way, Kiara. I'm almost through! And I'm almost at the branch. After that it'll be... [GROANS] ...easy! Right, Mom? Mom? Mom? [BOTH GROANING AND GRUNTING] Both : Mom? Now they're truly on the Trail to Udugu. 
 
 Simba : That was so exciting. Your first rescue with the King. I wonder what our next challenge will be. Well, let's go, Lion Guard. At least he's not mad at us for almost losing that egg. Why should he be? It's not your fault you can't jump like a lion. What's the point of being a team if we're all gonna do the same thing? Fuli, he's the King! He's gotta know what he's doing. Doesn't he? Maybe we just need to do it more Simba's way? Everyone! Everyone! The gazelles... The gazelles need our help! Lion Guard, follow me! [SIGHS] That's what I was going to say... Kiara : Mom? Mom! No sign of Mom on my side. Have you found anything? Kion? Nothing over here. [SIGHS SOFTLY] How could she just disappear? Mom! We'll find her. We just have to keep looking. Try your side again. I tried my side. If she was there I'd have seen her. I know, I just... I can't find her either. If we knew where this Udugu place was, maybe we could meet her there. Or we could track her. [SNIFFING] Got her! She went this way. Come on! [KIARA SNIFFS] Kiara, look! Paw prints. They look fresh. We must be getting close. Come on. [SNIFFING] What? They just stop right here?  Heyvi kabisa! Where did Mom go? The gazelles are just over the next ridge. There! Swala and the other gazelles must be looking for a route up to that grassland. But those rocks... They're unstable. The rocks will fall if the gazelles jump on them. Lion Guard, follow me! Should we remind him how easily gazelles spook when they're surprised? Nah! Simba knows what he's doing. It'll be fine. What's that? Something's coming! All : [PANICKED] Something's coming! Something's coming! Something's coming! They're spooked. Now we really need to hurry. Lion Guard, follow me! [GROUND RUMBLING] Everyone, stop! The cliff is collapsing! Ono, warn Simba! Affirmative! [GASPS] Oh, no! Simba! Your Majesty? Simba! [SIMBA COUGHING] Good to see you, Ono. Your Majesty! Everyone, he's over here. Are you all right? I'm okay. Just a little stuck. This can't be right. Mom couldn't just disappear. I don't get it. We followed her trail. How can it just end? Maybe it doesn't. There's a ledge and a trail. I bet Mom jumped up there. Then we will too. Ready? One, two, three! [BOTH GRUNTING] Not even close. If Mom could get up there, we can too. Mom's twice our size, Kion. How can we keep tracking her if we can't jump up? I've got it! I'll give you a boost, then you can keep tracking her. But what about you? One of us has to boost the other, and the truth is... you're the better tracker. I won't argue that. Though you're the one who saw the tracks and figured out Mom jumped. So we make a good team. And that's how we'll find Mom, by working together. Now up you go. [STRAINING] Whoa! I gotcha! Hang on. [STRAINING] Just a little closer. How's that? [STRAINING] I think I'm gonna make it. Yes! [PANTING] We did it! [GASPS] I don't believe it. Kiara, what's going on? Hello down there. [CHUCKLES] Mom! Mom, why did you disappear? I thought you were gonna show us the way to Udugu. Actually, I think you've already found Udugu. We have? Is it that big rock? No, Kion. Come on down, Kiara, and I'll explain. Uh, okay. You see, kids, Udugu isn't a place. Udugu is another word for kinship. It's the special bond between siblings. You found Udugu when you decided to work together to look for me. We did? Yes. And I'm very proud of you. Un-Bunga-lievable. You're one lucky lion. You could have gotten smushed. Don't worry, Your Majesty. We'll get you free. [OSTRICHES SCREAMING] That sounds like... Ostriches! [GASPS] Hapana! It's... Oh, uh... Well? It's what? Sorry. I thought you were going to say it. The gazelles! They're stampeding straight for the ostriches and their nest! Bad day to be an ostrich egg. Your Majesty, what do we do? You have to stop the gazelles. And leave you here? I'll be fine. You need to hurry. [ROCKS TUMBLING] Everyone, heads up! [GASPS] [CRASHES] [COUGHING] Whew! Thanks, Fuli. Thank Ono. He saw the boulder. We all try to do what we do best. That's why we're a great team. That is why, isn't it? We can't leave Simba here. It's not safe. But he told us to go after the gazelles. Lion Guard! All day I've been telling you to follow me, and do what I do. But that's not how your team works. So tell me. If I were Kion, how would you handle this? Fuli : We'd split up. Ono and I would go after the herd. Beshte and Bunga would stay to free you. Then those are my orders. Wait, wait, wait, wait! There's one more thing Kion would do. Right? Till the Pride Lands end... All : Lion Guard defend! [PANICKED SCREAMING] I'll calm the ostriches. You talk to the gazelles. Affirmative! Just remember, be soft and soothing. You know me! Hey, ostriches! Ostriches! Ostriches! [SCREAMING CONTINUES] [SHOUTS] Quiet! [SCREAMING STOPS] [SIGHS] That's better. Hello? Swala, gazelles, please slow down. What's that, Ono? Can't hear you. [CLEARS THROAT] I said... Whoa! Everybody, I can't hear Ono. Quiet! Stop! Now, what were you saying, Ono? Uh, never mind. Ono : That was weird. How'd you calm the ostriches? Soft and soothing. Just like you said. Don't worry, Your Highness. We'll have you out of there in no time. [SOFTLY] Careful, Big B. If you let the boulder roll the wrong way it'll squish him. Bunga, you know I can hear you, right? Uh, sure, I knew that. Did you know that? Yep. Beshte : Twende Kiboko! [BESHTE GRUNTS] All clear! [RUMBLING] Bunga : Uh-oh. Let's get out of here! [ALL PANTING] Whoo! That was un-Bunga-lievable! I kinda wanna do it again. Nice job, guys. Simba's safe, and so are the gazelles and ostriches. That's because you did it your way. Kion would be proud of you. And so am I. So, everyone, how was your journey? Did you find Udugu? We found it. But it's not really a place. It's about us working together as brother and sister. As a team. How did things go with the Guard? Well, in a way, the Guard helped me find Udugu, too. It's an important lesson. It is, especially for you two. And as Queen of the Pride Lands and leader of the Lion Guard, someday you will be responsible for all of this. [MUSIC] So hold on to what you learned today. Then you'll always have Udugu.
