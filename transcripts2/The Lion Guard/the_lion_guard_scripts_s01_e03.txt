 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ROARS] 
 [NARRATOR READING] 
 [KION READING] 
 [BABOONS SCREAMING] 
 Baboons, you gotta come down. 
 It's not safe up there. 
 We're dry up here. 
 [WHOOPS] 
 We'll come down when the rain stops. 
 This guy's un-Bunga-lievable. 
 Oh, baboons. 
 [BABOON WHOOPING] 
 [BESHTE GRUNTS] 
 Kion. The tree's gonna go. 
 And I don't wanna go with it. 
 [GRUNTING] 
 [WHIMPERING] 
 Calm down! As long as we stay dry, whoo-whoo, everything will be fine. 
 No, it won't. Your tree's about to fall off a cliff. 
 [GASPS] He's right. Look. 
 [SCREAMING] 
 No! Stay on this side of the tree! 
 [GRUNTS AND GROANS] 
 Can't hold it much longer. 
 [GRUNTS] 
  Harpana! 
 [WHOOPING AND SHRIEKING] 
 I got to get him out of that tree. 
 Beshte! Think you can take a little more weight? 
 [GRUNTS] 
 Sure. But whatever you're gonna do, do it fast. 
 Bunga, climb up there and scare those baboons down. 
 With pleasure! Zuka zama! 
 [GRUNTING] 
 Okay, baboonies, you can thank me later. 
 Ah. 
 [ELEPHANT TRUMPETING] 
 [WHOOPING AND SCREAMING] 
 I got you. 
 [SCREAMS] 
 [SCREAMING] 
 Come on outta there, baboonie. 
 [GRUNTING CONTINUES] 
 Whoa. 
 Oh. You can get off now. 
 We'll get down... [WHOOPS] when the rain stops. 
 Ugh. Baboons. 
 Whew. I'm beat. 
 Oh. Don't get too comfortable. 
 There's bound to be another storm. 
 Ohh, another one? 
 We're still cleaning up from the last one. 
 Beshte : Hmm. 
 Who knew a tree full of baboons would be so heavy? 
 [GROANS] 
 Okay, everybody take a breather. 
 You've earned it. 
 There you go, little guy. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 You're welcome. 
 [BIRDS SQUAWKING] 
 Kion : Heyvi kabisa! 
 Storm's caused so much destruction. 
 Grandfather? 
 Yes, Kion. I'm here. 
 I was thinking. 
 The rains cause so many problems for the Pride Lands. 
 What if I used the Roar to blow the big rain storms away? 
 [LAUGHS] 
 The rains are part of the Circle of Life, Kion. 
 The Pride Lands will need that water for the dry season. 
 I guess. But it'd be a lot easier... 
 Kion. The easy solution is not always the best solution. 
 Yes, Grandfather. 
 [RUMBLING] 
 Oh, no. 
 [YAWNS] 
 [MUFFLED] Beshte! Let me out! 
 Hmm? 
 [GASPING] 
 [SIGHS] 
 It smells like fish in there. 
 Guys, get up! Break's over! 
 What's the kerbubble, Kion? 
 Oh. 
 [BOTH COUGHING] 
 Ah. [GRUNTS] 
 [GRUNTS] Ah. 
 What's going on? There's never been a river here before. 
 Ono! Take a look! 
 Affirmative. 
 [GASPS] Hapana! 
 Lake Kiziwa! It's too full. The water's pouring out! 
 [GRUNTS] That last rainstorm's still causing trouble. 
 It's getting worse, Kion! 
 Lion Guard! We need to do something before all that water floods the valley. 
 Hey, I've got an idea. 
 [ALL GRUNTING] 
 Push, Beshte! We gotta block it out! 
  Twende Kiboko! 
 [ALL GRUNTING] 
 Poa! 
 [SIGHS] We did it! Nice! [CHUCKLING] Oh, my! Whose idea was this? Mine. Pretty awesome, huh? Impressive. What a great idea. And you know what makes this a great idea? It was so simple to do. Quick and easy. That's the way to do it. I don't know, Bunga. The easy solution's not always the best solution. Well, it sure worked with this dam. Uh-oh. Now look at it. What do we do about that? Hmm. Put a stick in it. That's my advice. Hey, it worked. What a good idea. He gives great advice. Good idea? Great advice? You know you're talking about Bunga, right? Don't be so surprised. Honey badgers, they are the Pride Lands' smartest animals when... Oh, oh, oh. Wait a minute. You hear that, everybody? I'm the Pride Lands' smartest animal. Rafiki said so. I'm smart and I give good advice. Say, wait till my uncles hear about this. Hey, Bunga! Wait up! Yes, yes. Honey badgers are the smartest when they think before they speak. [GROANS] But if they do not, whoo-hoo-hoo! Total disaster! [LAUGHS] Hmm, where'd everybody go? Eh? [MUMBLING A SONG] Bunga! Bunga, wait up! Voice : Um, a little help here? Uh-oh. [GRUNTING] Oh, we forgot to flip the turtles. Sorry about that. Oh, thank you. Phew. There you go, little guy. Well, the turtles are all flipped. We forget anything else? Argh. The porcupine brothers. Though that'd be easier if we had Bunga to help. Ono, go find Bunga. [HUMMING] Affirmative. [ALL GRUNTING] There you go, guys. See you next time. Porcupine : Thanks. Every storm it's the same thing. You'd think they'd just move. They like it here. It's cozy. Yeah, but how cozy do you really want to be when you're a porcupine? Porcupine : Ow, watch those quills! Okay, who wants to crawl in and make sure Ushari and the cobras aren't stuck in the mud? Don't look at me. [SIGHS] It's times like this we really need Bunga. Yeah, but he's... Ono : Everyone! You gotta see what's going on at Hakuna Matata Falls! Whoa! Kion : Heyvi kabisa! What is all this? Rafiki said he's the wisest... Of all the animals in the whole Pride Lands. Oh. Amazing. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast, kids. If you want to see him, you've got to wait in line! See who? Both : Bunga the Wise. The Sage of Hakuna Matata Falls. All : The what? Seriously?

 Nice of you to drop by. [GRUNTS] Bunga the Wise, everyone thinks I'm stuck up because my head's so high up in the sky. What do I do? Simple. Tie a knot in your neck. Bunga the Wise, how can I keep from being scared whenever I see a hyena? That's easy. Just... [WHISPERING] Mmm-hmm. Mmm. Thanks. Mmm, Bunga the Wise, suppose I see a pile of rocks with a leak in it. Where do I find a stick? Just climb up a tree and grab one. Trees are full of sticks. All right, all right. Everybody back in line. No more freebies. Don't worry. You'll all get your turn eventually! Come on, kid, er, I mean, Your Sage-iness. Uh, okay. Talk you all soon! [CLEARS THROAT] Next! [BUG CHIRPING] [GULPS] Ah. You're too kind. Now, if you'll follow me... Kion : Hey! Bunga! Uh-oh. Whoa. Whoa. What part of "wait in line" did you kids not understand? Give me a break, Timon. We need to talk to Bunga. [CLEARS THROAT] It's Bunga the Wise. Oh, hi, guys. Didn't see you there. Come on in. Fine. Make it fast. We got lots of folks here waiting their turn! Okay, I'll just be out here. Bunga, what's going on? Are you seriously giving all of those animals advice? That's right. You heard Rafiki. I'm super-smart. Hello? Remember? I had that great idea to stop the lake from flooding. I guess. So, then, I had an even better idea. I could share my great ideas. I can help everybody in the Pride Lands by telling them what to do. Ow. Seriously? Bunga, you already help the Pride Lands. You're on the Lion Guard. You're the Pride Lands' bravest! But I'm also the smartest! It's difficult being so gifted. Bunga... Okay, okay. Time's up. Folks outside ain't gettin' any smarter. Thanks for coming, guys! Next time make an appointment! Ow. Fuli : If you ask me, Bunga's the one animal in the Pride Lands who should not be giving advice. Why's that, Fuli? He did figure out how to keep the lake from flooding. Yeah, he did. But I just got a bad feeling about all this.  Heyvi kabisa! [MUFFLED CRIES] I didn't think ostriches really did that. They don't. And I don't think that one likes it very much. Come on. [ALL GRUNTING] [GASPS] Oh. Thank you. Hard to breathe down there. [SPITS] Ugh. [SPITS] Sand. Ugh. [SPITS] Watch where you're spitting. [GROANS] Tall birds. [SHUDDERING] Are you okay? I am now. [COUGHS] Thanks. So why'd you stick your head in the sand in the first place? Bunga the Wise said it was the best way to avoid seeing hyenas. And he's the smartest animal there is. [SCOFFS] Don't say it. [GASPS] Hapana! Those pink flowers will make them sick. Bushbucks! Stop! I got 'em. [GRUNTS] Hey! Our flowers! You shouldn't eat these. These flowers will make you sick. But Bunga the Wise said pink flowers were the tastiest. And he's the smartest animal there is. I know what you're thinking. Voice : Help! Uh, now what? Help! Hang on! We'll help you out. Please. I don't like high places. Fuli, pick a horn. Beshte, you say when. Don't worry. They hardly ever drop anybody. Hardly ever? Oh. Pull! [BOTH GRUNTING] [GROANING] [GASPING] Thank you so much. How'd you get trapped down there? It wasn't advice from Bunga the Wise, was it? Why, yes, it was. I asked him about the fastest way across the canyon. And he just said to jump. Okay, go ahead and say it. I told you Bunga shouldn't be handing out advice! Yeah. We've got to tell him to stop. Do we have to stand in line again? I don't think so. Look!  ♪ Bunga, Bunga Ho, make way, make way ♪  ♪ He's the wisest we know ♪  ♪ Make way for Bunga the Wise ♪  ♪ Make way for Bunga the Wise ♪  ♪ Bunga, Bunga, hey, Bungy, Bunga, ho ♪  ♪ Make way, make way, he's the wisest we know ♪ [SINGING CONTINUES] Catchy! I like it! Now I've seen everything. Oh, come on. Oh, hi, guys. Don't stop. Bunga, what are you doing? Bunga's advice is so popular we decided to take it on the road. Bunga the Wise "The Pride Lands Tour"! I advise you to come along with us. Sounds like fun. Sounds like trouble. Bunga, you've got to stop this. We've got enough to do trying to deal with the rainstorm. Your bad advice is making things worse. [GASPS] Me? Bad advice? What? [BOTH GASP] No! Rafiki said Bunga was smart. You see, Kion? Everyone loves my advice. They wouldn't know what to do without it. Am I right? Yeah. That's right. We're clueless. And Bunga gives good advice. You said it, Pumbaa. He's even given the Lion Guard advice. Anybody remember a little thing called... the dam? Yes! Whoo! Love it! That's right! His idea. His advice. Problem solved. The End. [RUMBLING] And now I have some advice. [YELLING] Run! [ALL SCREAMING] We've gotta move those animals to safety. Lion Guard, follow me! [SIGHS] [PUMBAA WAILING] Run Bunga, run! Don't be a mook, kid! Head for the hills! I'm a member of the Lion Guard. I can't let my friends down. Hey guys! Wait for me! Split up! You can stop fanning me now! Everyone, follow me! Now! Zebras, stay close to each other and follow Kion.  Twende kiboko! [PANTING] Got ya. Hurry! Into the canyon! Ah! Come on, kid! Run! Take my advice! Don't look back! [ANIMALS GRUNTING] Ono! Which way? Oh, no. Left! Go left! This way, everybody! To the left! A dead end! Oh, no! Kion! [GASPS] Oh, no. Look out! [ALL GROANING] Kion, the walls are too steep to climb. What do we do? Don't ask Kion. Ask Bunga the Wise. Bunga the Wise! What do we do? Tell us. Uh... I don't know. Kion's the one who always knows what to do with this kinda stuff. Right, Kion? Right. But it's not exactly quick and easy. Now, everyone! Get behind me! He means it! Get behind him! Get behind him! [ROARING] [ALL CHEERING] [SIGHS] I like this view. Me, too. Yeah. This is a great place to rest up after a rain storm. Until the next one. Oh. Mmm-hmm. [EXHALES] [MUMBLING A TUNE] That spot with the flowers, it looks like the perfect place to bask in the sun. I would not lie there, if I were you. Pfft. Come on, Rafiki. I can tell the best spots to bask. I'm the smartest animal around. You said so yourself. You did not hear everything I said. Honey badgers are only smartest when they think things through. Think things through? [SPLASH] Uh. Guess I'm not so wise after all. Oh, well. I can live with that.
