 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ROARS] 
 [NARRATOR READING] 
 [KION READING] 
 [SNIFFING] 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 [LEAVES RUSTLING] 
 Gotcha! 
 Fuli : Hey! 
 Now it's your turn to be "it" and my turn to hide! 
 Yeah, okay, fine. But first... 
 Could you move your paw? 
 [SIGHS] I still don't get it, Kion. 
 Why are we playing hide-and-seek in the first place? 
 It's not just hide-and-seek. 
 It's a way to practice our tracking skills. 
 Ah, that does sound better. 
 Yeah! Besides, it's fun! 
 How long did it take Kion to find you two? 
 Somehow he found me right away. 
 He laughed when I walked past him. 
 Kion found me pretty fast, too. 
 What about Beshte? Haven't you found him? 
 Oh, yeah, I found him. 
 I just haven't told him yet. 
 Okay, Beshte! 
 You can come out from behind the rocks now! 
 [CHUCKLES] You got me. 
 Pretty good hiding place, though, right? 
 I have to admit, for someone your size, you're a surprisingly good hider. 
 Thanks, Ono. 
 Okay, Fuli. Everyone's been "it" but you. 
 Close your eyes so we can go hide. 
 Hmm. Fine. But I warn you. 
 I'm the fastest finder in the Pride Lands! 
 Oh, yeah? Well, I'm the fastest hider! 
 [GRUNTING] 
 He does realize that doesn't count for anything, right? 
 I'm not sure he does. 
 [SIGHS] Okay. Everybody go hide! 
 Fuli : Ready or not, here I come! 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Voice : Excuse me? 
 [EXCLAIMS] Who's in there? 
 Just me. I didn't mean to startle you, but you were standing on my hoof. 
 I was? I'm sorry! 
 Say, I don't think we've met. 
 I'm Beshte! What's your name? 
 Uh, I'm Ajabu. 
 Pleased to meet you, Ajabu. 
 Come on out. I won't bite. 
 Hmm. Okay. 
 Poa. I've never met anyone that looks like you. 
 [CHUCKLES] And I've met pretty much everyone in the Pride Lands. 
 Well, you see, I'm not from around here. 
 I believe it. 
 So Ajabu, are you a zebra? Or a giraffe? 
 Neither! I'm an okapi. 
 An okapi? Poa! 
 I've never met an okapi before. 
 Well, there aren't many of us. Even back home. 
 How come you were hiding in the bushes? 
 It's what I do. 
 Hide in bushes? 
 Oh, not just bushes. I hide behind trees, behind rock piles... 
 Oh, if I see a hole, I'll hide in the hole. 
 Why do you hide so much? 
 Where I come from, it's the smartest thing for an okapi to do. 
 [GASPS] Hey, Twiga. 
 Morning, Beshte. 
 Ajabu? Where'd you go? 
 Ajabu : [SOFTLY] I'm here. Behind the rocks. 
 Beshte : Come back out! That was just Twiga. 
 She's a nice giraffe. No need to hide from her. 
 Back where I come from, you can't be too careful. 
 Where do you come from? 
 A place far away with lots of bushes and plenty of trees, a fair amount of rock piles. A hole or two. [LAUGHS] 
 Lots of places to hide. 
 So why'd you leave? 
 Oh, I got chased out. Guess I didn't hide well enough. 
 Who chased you out? 
 A leopard. 
 Okapis are a leopard's favorite food. 
 Well, you've got nothing to hide from here. 
 We don't have any leopards in the Pride Lands. 
 Really? 
 Hippo's honor! 
 Then you think I could stop hiding? 
 Well, sure. Come on, Ajabu. 
 I'll give you a tour. You're gonna love it here.

 [SNIFFING] 
 [SNIFFING] 
 [GROWLS] 
 [SHOUTS] 
 [LAUGHS] Gotcha! 
 How come everybody always finds me first? 
 Maybe it has something to do with your smell. 
 [SNIFFS] It is unmistakable, isn't it? 
 Well, that's one way of looking at it. 
 Now to find Ono, Beshte and Kion. 
 Oh, and speaking of Kion, here's a nice fresh set of his tracks! 
 Right behind ya, Fuli! 
 [SNIFFING] 
 [GRUNTS] What you got, Fuli? 
 Look. These aren't Kion's tracks. 
 Unless he's got one foot bigger than the others. 
 Nah, I don't think so. 
 Kion! Beshte! Ono! Game's over! 
 You guys need to see this! 
 On my way! 
 Fuli! What is it? You find something? 
 Any idea what kind of animal makes tracks like that? 
 Heyvi kabisa! These are leopard tracks! 
 That's what I thought, too. 
 Leopard tracks? You sure? 
 But there aren't any leopards living in the Pride Lands. 
 Well, there's one now. 
 The question is, where? Ono? 
 I'm on it! 
 Any chance it's just a hyrax with really big feet? 
 Hapana! 
 Everyone! Everyone! I saw the leopard! 
 He's going after some gazelles! 
 Lead the way, Ono. Till the Pride Lands' end... 
 All : Lion Guard defend! 
 [GROWLING] 
 Get out of the Pride Lands, leopard! Now! 
 Name's Makucha, lion. 
 You want me to go, you're gonna have to make me. 
 But you'll have to catch me first! 
 No problem! Huwezi! 
 You got nowhere to go now! 
 That's what you think, cheetah! 
 [SHOUTS] 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [LAUGHING] 
 Wow! He sure can jump! 
 Pretty fast, too. 
 This guy's not gonna be easy to catch. 
 Did you see the gazelles? 
 They weren't scared of the leopard at all. 
 That's why we've got to get him out of the Pride Lands. 
 None of the herds know that leopards are hunters. 
 So, they don't realize they should be scared. 
 They're all going to be sitting ducks! 
 Especially the ducks. 
 That's why we gotta find him. 
 Now let's split up so we can cover more ground. 
 Fuli, you're with me. Bunga, you Ono and... 
 Hey, where is Beshte? 
 I bet he's still hiding. 
 Don't worry, Kion. We'll find him. 
 Yeah. Let's go, Ono! 
 Zuka Zama! 
 [LAUGHS] You're right, Beshte. 
 The Pride Lands really do seem great. 
 See? What did I tell ya? 
 There's plenty to eat, and no need to hide. 
 You could... 
 
 
 
 Bunga : Beshte! 
 Here you are! We've been looking everywhere for you. 
 Ono! Found him! 
 Actually, I think I saw him first. 
 Maybe, but I got here first. 
 [SIGHS] Fine. 
 Hi, guys. 
 I've been giving my new pal Ajabu a tour of the Pride Lands. 
 What new pal are you talking about? 
 This one here! Aja... Huh? He was here a second ago. 
 Ajabu? Ajabu! 
 What's this Ajabu look like? Maybe I've seen him around. 
 Probably not. He's new to the Pride Lands. 
 I think I'm the only one who's seen him. 
 I didn't see him. I only saw you. 
 So what's he look like? 
 Well... His top half looks like a giraffe, his bottom half looks like zebra, and his face kind of looks like an oryx but without the horns. 
 Sounds different. 
 Is that one new pal or three new pals? 
 Just one. He's a nice guy. You'd like him. 
 And you're the only one who can see him? 
 No, no. I'm just the only one who has seen him. 
 Uh, Beshte? 
 Maybe you've been hiding all alone a little too long. 
 No, seriously, he was right here. 
 Sure he was, Big B! But we gotta go now. 
 The Lion Guard needs us. Right Ono? 
 Affirmative. Follow me! 
 Beshte. Glad they could find you. 
 Sorry about that. What's the kerbubble? 
 There's a leopard in the Pride Lands. 
 [GASPS] A leopard? Are you sure? 
 Yeah, we chased him, but he got away. 
 This is terrible! 
 I'm pretty sure we can handle one leopard. 
 You don't understand. 
 I told Ajabu there aren't any leopards in the Pride Lands. 
 Who's Ajabu? 
 My new friend. 
 I think your new friend's safe, Beshte. 
 The leopard will be going after real animals. 
 Ajabu is real! 
 And is he here right now? 
 Of course not! Least, I don't think so. 
 Unless he's hiding. [GRUNTS] 
 Ajabu? Ajabu! 
 What's going on? 
 Beshte has an imaginary friend. 
 He's not imaginary! 
 He looked pretty imaginary to us. 
 You didn't even see him. 
 Guys! We don't have time to talk about this right now. 
 Kion's right. We've got a leopard on the loose. 
 And it's up to us to catch him. 
 Right. You got it, Kion! 
 Now, let's go! Till the Pride Lands' end... 
 All : Lion Guard Defend! 
 More leopard tracks. Makucha definitely came this way. 
 Yup! Looks like we're on the right "track." Get it? 
 Get what? We are on the right track. 
 This is a track and it's the right one. 
 It was kinda funny, right? 
 Well... 
 The leopard's headed this way. 
 Yeah. But it's hard to tell which way he went after he got into the tall grass. 
 Hey! I see him! 
 There he goes! [GASPS] 
 Come on! 
 How come I didn't see him? 
 I think he went this way. 
 I still don't see him. 
 [SQUAWKING] 
 Hapana! 
 [SHOUTS] 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [SIGHS] I could've sworn I saw him run this way. 
 You sure it was the leopard? 
 The leopard? No, I thought I saw Ajabu. 
 Who? [SPITTING] 
 Hang on. We've been chasing your imaginary friend? 
 He's not imaginary! 
 Big B? You know none of us have seen him, right? 
 It's true. 
 But guys. He really is real. 
 Why don't you believe me? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe because your half-zebra half-giraffe friend sounds so un-Bunga-lievable! 
 Bunga, you really hurt his feelings. 
 Why don't you two believe him? 
 You heard what the guy's supposed to look like. 
 Half zebra, half giraffe, half oryx. 
 And we didn't see him, even when Beshte said he was right there. 
 Do you believe him? 
 I do. Beshte doesn't make things up. 
 Besides, did you hear him say his new friend was chased here by a leopard? 
 Yeah, so? 
 So we have a strange animal who says he was chased here by a leopard. 
 And we have a leopard! 
 When you put it that way, it does sound real. 
 I didn't mean to hurt his feelings. 
 We should go say we're sorry. 
 Good idea. 
 Hey, Big B? Don't be mad. 
 We're sorry we didn't believe your friend was real. 
 He just sounded made-up. Sorry. [SPITS] 
 [SIGHS] That's okay. 
 He does look different from anyone I've ever seen. 
 I might not have believed me, either. 
 So we're pals again? 
 We always were, Little B. 
 Okay, guys. Don't forget, we still have a leopard at large. 
 And if we believe in Beshte's friend, we've got to believe that the leopard's looking for him. 
 That's right! So we've got to find him first! 
 Beshte! Wait for us! 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 Well, Beshte did say the Pride Lands were safe. 
 Oh, hello, there. 
 Hi. Nice to meet ya. 
 Oh, nice stripes. [CHUCKLES] 
 Hello. 
 Not to get personal, stranger, but are you a zebra? 
 Uh, no. I'm not. 
 [GASPS] I knew it! 
 You're not a zebra! 
 [GROWLING] 
 Look who's here. 
 I know that. I said I'm not. 
 Well, what are you then? Are you a short giraffe? 
 [LAUGHS] No. I'm a... 
 Are you a fancy antelope? 
 No! I'm a... 
 Shh, shh! Wait, don't tell me. 
 You're a... You're a... Hmm. 
 Leopard! 
 Leopard? What's that? 
 Something big and mean with sharp teeth! 
 And it's coming this way! 
 Mmm-hmm. So it is. 
 Well, in that case, my advice is... 
 Panic and run! Panic and run! 
 Panic and run! 
 The leopard! Come on! 
 Makucha! I... I can't believe you chased me all this way! 
 You okapis are rare. 
 Once you find one, you stay on its trail. 
 And your trail is about to come to an end. 
 [LAUGHING] 
 Panic and run! Panic and... [YELLS] 
 I know I'm delicious, but don't eat me! Please! 
 [GROWLS] 
 I'm after somebody a lot tastier than you. 
 Well! I've never been so insulted in all my life. 
 Kion : Till the Pride Lands' end... 
 All : Lion Guard Defend! 
 Ugh! Not these guys again. 
 Somebody tastier than me... I mean, really? 
 [SCOFFS] 
 Anybody else think it's weird that the leopard didn't go after any of the zebras? 
 Yeah, now that you mention it. 
 [GASPS] I bet Ajabu was hiding in the herd! 
 Remember I said his back half is striped like a zebra's? 
 He'd blend right in. 
 So you think the leopard was after your new pal? 
 He did say leopards chase okapis all the time where he came from. 
 Well, they're in the Pride Lands now. 
 And the Lion Guard is gonna keep Ajabu safe! 
 Thanks. I knew he could count on you guys. 
 [YELLS] 
 What is that thing? 
 [YELLS] 
 Beshte : That's Ajabu! 
 Well, I'll be a baboon's brother! 
 Ajabu's actually real? 
 You said you believed me. 
 We did, but now we really believe you. 
 [GROANS] Anyway, I'm glad you've finally seen him. 
 Uh-oh! So has the leopard! 
 Lion Guard, let's go! 
 Leave me alone, Makucha! Just go back home, won't you? 
 No way! I've chased you too far to give up now. 
 [GROWLING] 
 [SHOUTS] 
 Poa! Nice move, Ajabu! 
 Now you're just making me mad! 
 [YELLS] 
 I've got you now! 
 Not on my watch! Twende Kiboko! 
 [GROANS] 
 Wow! 
 You okay, Ajabu? 
 I'm fine! 
 [GROWLING] 
 Why don't you mind your own business? 
 I'm just saying hello to an old friend. 
 This is our business. 
 And you're not acting too friendly. 
 So leopards say hello with their teeth, so what? 
 So it's time for you to say goodbye! 
 Come on! I can fight two at once! 
 [GROWLS] 
 Let's make it three! What's the matter? 
 Honey badger got your tail? [LAUGHS] 
 Ugh! I hope you taste better than you smell. 
 Incoming! 
 [ONO GRUNTS] 
 [LAUGHS] 
 You guys are amazing! 
 Thanks. Now you stay here. 
 I'll be right back! 
 [SNARLING] 
 [BELLOWING] 
 Fine! Have it your way! 
 Not even an okapi is worth this. 
 Bunga : Whoa! [BELLOWS] 
 Don't stop till you're out of the Pride Lands! 
 Bunga, let go! 
 Good idea! 
 Whoa! 
 And don't come back! 
 Guess I told him. [CHUCKLES] 
 Hey, everybody, I've got someone I want you to meet. 
 Kion, Fuli, Bunga, Ono... 
 This is my new friend Ajabu. 
 Hello. Hi. 
 Ajabu, meet the Lion Guard. 
 Hi, everyone. I don't know how to thank you for saving me. 
 It's what we do. 
 [SNIFFING] 
 [GASPS] Are you a honey badger? 
 I sure am! 
 [LAUGHING] Wow! I've heard of honey badgers, but I never believed they were real. 
 Oh, yeah? Why's that? 
 I figured nobody could look and smell like that. 
 I thought they had to be made up. But you're real! 
 Yep! I'm as real as it gets! 
 You're not planning on going back home, are you? 
 That leopard will be waiting for you. 
 What else am I gonna do? 
 I think I've got an idea. 
 Mom, Dad? Ajabu came to the Pride Lands as a visitor, but he'd really like to stay. If he has your blessing. 
 Of course, Ajabu. 
 You're welcome to stay in the Pride Lands. 
 For as long as you like. 
 Oh, thank you, Your Highness! Thank you! 
 We're happy to have you here, Ajabu. 
 [ALL CHEERING] 
 Welcome to the Pride Lands! 
 So Ajabu. Now that you're a Pride Lander, what do you want to do next? 
 Ha! I know! 
 Let's play some more hide-and-seek! 
 Ajabu : Okay. [CHUCKLES] 
 Un-Bunga-lievable! He's really good at that! 
 [LAUGHS]
