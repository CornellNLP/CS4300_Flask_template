 ADULT SHELDON:  I've always loved trains.   
 In fact, if my career   
 in theoretical physics hadn't worked out, my backup plan   
 was to become a professional ticket taker.   
 Or hobo.   
 (train whistle blows)    
 ♪ ♪    
 And when I figured out that trains allowed me   
 to prove Newton's first law...   
 An object in motion stays in motion   
 with the same speed and in the same direction   
 unless acted upon by an unbalanced force...   
 I felt like Neil Armstrong on the moon,   
 alone and happy.

 (giggles) I don't care how dimwitted you are.   
 Scientific principles have to make you smile.   
 Of course, nobody I knew in East Texas   
 in      cared about Newtonian physics.   
 The only Newtons they cared about   
 were Wayne and Fig.   
 MISSY: Sheldon, if you don't get in here,

 What language? So?    
 I was exploring dimensional kinematics.    
 Admit it... He's adopted.    
 SHELDON: How can I be adopted    
 when I have a twin sister?    
 Think, monkey, think.    
 MARY: That's enough.    
 No one's adopted.    
 I wish I was.    
 That can still be arranged.    
 Now, let's pray.    
 A moment, please.

 - Leave him be. 
- He can hold hands with his family. It won't kill him.    
 We don't know that.    
 Georgie, did you wash your hands before dinner?    
 Or even this week?    
 None of your business.    
 Hence the mittens.    
 MARY: Thank you, God, for this food we're about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies,    
 and bless the hands that prepared it.    
 ALL: Amen.    
 How come we ain't got no tater tots?    
 I made tater tots last night.    
 GEORGE: I'd take tater tots    
 over mashed potaters any day.    
 - Just eat what I made you. 
- Can we at least have tater tots tomorrow?    
 ADULT SHELDON:  It was family dinners like this   
 that led me to adopt a mid-Atlantic accent.   
 Nobel Prize winners...   
 (Southern accent):  ought not be orderin' tater tots.   
 Everybody excited to start school Monday?    
 I am.    
 I guess so.    
 MARY: Georgie?    
 Freshman year, that's a big deal.    
 How can I be excited when he's gonna be    
 in the same grade as me?    
 SHELDON: Don't worry, Georgie, I'm not planning    
 on being in the ninth grade for very long.    
 All I know is he's not in the same grade as me anymore,    
 and I'm thrilled.    
 Good luck with your finger painting.    
 You're gonna get your ass kicked in high school.    
 MARY: Hey, language.    
 I'm not going to be assaulted.    
 High school is a haven for higher learning.    
 Oh, dear God.    
 Speaking of God, who's going to church

- GEORGE SR.: I can't.    
 I'm meeting with the other coaches.    
 You can't meet after church?    
 No, Mary, I can't meet after church.    
 Georgie?    
 I got to study my playbook.    
 I'll go with you, Mom.    
 MISSY: Why are you going?    
 - You don't believe in God. 
- No,    
 but I believe in Mom.    
 I'll take it. Missy?    
 Can't, Heather asked me to...

 In Matthew nine, verse four, Jesus said,     
 "Why would you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"

 Leave it alone, Mary. 
He doesn't need a bowtie.     
 It's his first day of school. 
Let him wear what he wants.

 Just to give you a little history,     
 I've been here at Medford for    years...     
 I taught some of your older brothers and sisters,     
 and sadly, some of your parents.     
 Not much I haven't seen.     
 Until today.     
 I'm sure you're well aware we have a student with us,     
 who, despite his young age,     
 is remarkably gifted.     
 And I expect y'all to make him feel welcome.     
 Yes, Sheldon?     
 Per the student dress and grooming code,     
 this boy's hair is too long,     
 this boy is wearing sports attire     
 outside of a designated area     
 and this girl's blouse is diaphanous,     
 which means I can see her brassiere.

- Thank you.     
 I will take that into account.     
 All right.     
 We have a few minutes before first period.     
 I need y'all to fill out these forms.     
 What?     
 Also in violation     
 of the grooming code on page   ,     
 article five, subsection B,     
 you have a bit of a mustache.

 belong in our school.     
 PETERSEN: Come on Vicky, it's just the first day.     
 Why don't we all just take a deep breath here?     
 The hell with that. Five minutes into my math class,     
 he questioned my credentials.     
 How am I supposed to control a classroom when a kid accuses me     
 of being in breach of the hygiene code?     
 Well, Hubert, it wouldn't kill you to shower     
 a little more often. George, you want to weigh in here?

- INGRAM: Oral Roberts University

 No. I tend to wonder about the bigger questions.     
 Okay, well, here's why.     
 Your dad had a real good coaching job     
 and I saw some grown-ups breaking rules.     
 What'd they do?     
 I-It's kind of complicated, but...     
 football coaches aren't allowed to recruit kids     
 from other high schools to play on their teams.     
 And you told on them?     
 Yeah. You know what happened?     
 Justice descended upon the rule breakers?     
 I got fired, Sheldon.     
 And I got a bad reputation.     
 Oh. That's why you drink so much beer.     
 Just do yourself a favor.     
 Okay? Go to school tomorrow,
