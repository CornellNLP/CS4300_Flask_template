 "That everyone who believes may have eternal life in him. 
 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son."  Here we go. 
 Yes, Sheldon? 
 When you said God gave his son to the world,  did you mean Earth or the universe? 
 Earth. 
 But if God created the universe,  wouldn't he want to save all of it? 
 Yes, uh, he would. 
 Then why did you say Earth? 
 "Earth" is a synonym for the universe. 
 He's grabbing at straws now. 
 So if God's plan is to save all of the universe,  that means a race of octopus aliens light-years away  - could only be saved by Jesus? 
 - Sure. 
 - Even though they never would've heard of him? 
 - Yes. 
 Even though his appearance might be terrifying to them? 
 W-Why would his appearance be terrifying? 
 He has four limbs and they have eight. 
 - Okay, that's enough. 
 - No, no. 
 I prayed people would be more interested in my sermons. 
 I suppose I should've been more specific. 
 Sheldon, if these creatures  were born without sin, they don't need to be saved by Jesus. 
 What if an octopus Adam and Eve brought sin to their world? 
 Would they be saved by a human Jesus or an octopus Jesus?

 And then I said octopus aliens didn't need to become Christian  because they're not affected by original sin. 
 You should've been there. 
 Pastor Jeff almost started crying. 
 Oh, now I'm sorry I missed it. 
 That's your fault for having a hangover. 
 Or it's God's fault for putting Sunday morning  after Saturday night. 
 - Meemaw, could you take me to Radio Shack? 
 - Hello? 
 Sure, maybe later. 
 Later's a little vague. 
 Could you please be more specific? 
 When I'm good and ready. 
 How's that? 
 Better, but I'd really like to nail this down. 
 Why don't you ask your father to take you? 
 - Dad? 
 - What? 
 Can you please take me to Radio Shack? 
 I'm busy. 
 Ask your meemaw. 
 I did. 
 She said to ask you. 
 Well, ask her again. 
 Seems counterintuitive, but all right. 
 Meemaw? 
 Oh, Lord. 
 Everything okay? 
 No. 
 Stephanie Hanson's daughter was in a car accident last night. 
 She died. 
 Oh, no. 
 My God. 
 She was barely 16. 
 That's horrible. 
 Is there anything we can do? 
 I don't know. 
 Um... 
 ugh. 
 I need to call folks at the church. 
 Any more thoughts on Radio Shack? 
 Sheldon, do you really think  this is the appropriate time to ask that question? 
 I did, but now I'm second-guessing myself. 
 How you holding up? 
 I'm okay. 
 16 years old. 
 It's just awful. 
 It's all part of God's plan. 
 How come we don't get to go to the funeral? 
 Why would you want to go to a funeral? 
 I've never been to one. 
 When you get to be my age, you get to go to plenty. 
 That's, like, a hundred years from now. 
 You make it hard to love you. 
 Do you really see a dead body? 
 Sometimes. 
 How close do you get to it? 
 Real close, if you want. 
 And the clothes they're wearing,  is that the clothes they become a ghost in? 
 Depends. 
 In the movie Ghost,  Patrick Swayze has on the outfit that he dies in. 
 Casper runs around butt naked. 
 Maybe he died naked. 
 That's fun to think about. 
 And y'all wonder why you're not at the funeral. 
 Good morning, Peg. 
 Well, it will be once this cup of Sanka works its magic. 
 Is Pastor available? 
 Oh, he's on the phone with his wife. 
 - Oh, should I come back? 
 - Nah. 
 He usually gets his groveling done pretty quick. 
 So... that little Hanson girl, that was horrible, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Reminds you that... 
 life is precious. 
 You're up, slugger. 
 Come in. 
 I have the clothing drive flyers if you'd like to take a look. 
 Thank you. 
 You all right, Mare? 
 No, not really. 
 Um... 
 I can't stop thinking about that little girl. 
 I understand. 
 That's why it's important in these times  to take comfort in our faith. 
 What if that's not doing the trick? 
 Events like this can certainly create doubt. 
 It happens to me more often than I'd like to admit. 
 What do you do? 
 I roll up my sleeves and I work even harder at serving our Lord. 
 Mary, we each have a relationship with God,  and relationships take work. 
 Get out there. 
 Help the needy, start a Bible study,  hug a stranger and tell 'em the Lord loves 'em. 
 But not a child. 
 That backfires on you, big-time. 
 Thank you, Pastor Jeff. 
 You are most welcome. 
 Oh, and tell Sheldon  I spoke to my seminary professor,  and the official ruling is:  God would appear to the octopus aliens in octopus alien form  and save their eight-legged souls. 
 Praise Jesus! 
 I should put that in a sermon. 
 Hold on, hold on. 
 Thank you, God,  for this food we are about to receive and for the nourishment  of our bodies, and bless the hands that prepared it. 
 Amen. 
 We're doing this at breakfast now? 
 Yes, I think it's a nice idea. 
 She's eating Count Chocula. 
 Doesn't he play for the other side? 
 I'm so glad God blessed you with a sense of humor, George. 
 Mom, have you received any distressing phone calls today? 
 No. 
 Why? 
 Just wondering if it's an appropriate time  to ask if you could take me to Radio Shack. 
 Sorry, sweetheart, I can't today. 
 I have to bring this food over to the Hanson family. 
 Then I have my new prayer group. 
 And after that, I'm gonna get started  on a faith garden in the backyard. 
 A faith garden? 
 What the hell is that? 
 Language. 
 It's an outdoorsy place for me to speak to God. 
 Don't you already speak to him indoorsy? 
 Yes, but in the backyard,  I can enjoy the beautiful world he gave us. 
 You can also smell the Sparks' chicken coop. 
 Well, I think it sounds nice. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm gonna need your truck  to get all the dirt and flowers and tools that I need. 
 - Sure. 
 - Oh, oh, almost forgot. 
 Can you keep an eye out for a rock big enough  to paint a Psalm on? 
 I can do that. 
 Wish me luck! 
 Luck! 
 Mm-hmm! 
 Is Mom okay? 
 How the heck should I know? 
 She left. 
 You can say "hell."  ...our hearts and stir us to action. 
 If my mother's faith was  the Starship Enterprise, over the next week,  she achieved warp factor nine. 
 I can't hear you. 
 Amen! 
 Let 'em hear ya in heaven! 
 - Amen! 
 - Heck yeah! 
 Amen! 
 Despite his concerns over her sanity,  my dad found a rock worthy of her faith garden. 
 Ooh, right over there. 
 - Here? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 Gently! 
 Honey, it's a rock. 
 I know, but still.

 So when you gonna take me to get my learner's permit? 
 Georgie, you've heard us talking to Sheldon  about asking questions at inappropriate times, right? 
 Yeah, so? 
 So, given what's happened this week,  do you think it's an appropriate time  to be talking about driving? 
 Why? 
 'Cause that girl died? 
 Yes, that. 
 For your information, I'd be an excellent driver. 
 I wouldn't trust you to push a shopping cart. 
 Would you feel more confident if I told you  I already know how to drive? 
 - Video games don't count. 
 - I'll have you know  I've driven Meemaw's car. 
 I also drove your truck one night while you were sleeping. 
 Are you crazy?! 
 I parked it and everything. 
 You had no idea. 
 Okay, let... 
 let me get this straight... 
 you're trying to prove to me that you're a responsible person  by admitting you stole my truck. 
 I said I was responsible. 
 Never said I was smart. 
 - Hey. 
 - Let's go out. 
 - Go out where? 
 - I don't know,  Dairy Queen, shooting range, line dancing? 
 Have you been drinking? 
 I might've had a wine cooler or two. 
 Sweetheart, that ain't drinking. 
 The bartender asked to see my I.D. 
 Honey, he does that to get tips. 
 He asked me for mine, too. 
 Well, I like to think we're both young attractive ladies. 
 To that old fart? 
 Yeah. 
 - Mmm. 
 - Whoa. 
 Whoa, pace yourself, cowgirl. 
 I'm fine. 
 Now, are we gonna shoot pool or not? 
 You bet. 
 Hmm! 
 Did you know George and I used to come here  when we first started dating? 
 Is that so? 
 He kissed me right over there in that booth. 
 
 
 
 Why, was there some barbecue sauce on your face? 
 It's a fat joke. 
 I got it, Mom. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Why are you putting us to bed? 
 - 'Cause your mother's out. 
 - Where is she? 
 She's with your grandmother. 
 - Where'd they go? 
 - I don't know. 
 - Why don't you know? 
 - Because I'm here with you. 
 Good night. 
 Sweet dreams. 
 Mom gives us kisses. 
 Fine. 
 Mm, your beard's scratchy. 
 Too bad. 
 Sheldon? 
 I respectfully pass. 
 Mom also does the good night dance. 
 Now you're just screwing with me. 
 Night. 
 You should've gone with "sings us a lullaby."  Yeah, I got cocky. 
 Slow down there, sister. 
 You got church in the morning. 
 Who says I'm going? 
 What is happening with you? 
 Do you really want to know? 
 So, the other day I was making a casserole  to bring over to the Hansons,  and I wanted to include a sympathy card. 
 So I started to write... 
 "Your daughter's in a better place."  And I had to stop. 
 Because how could that possibly be true? 
 How could a better place be anywhere  than at home safe with her family? 
 She was just a little kid. 
 That could've... 
 been Georgie behind the wheel. 
 How could that possibly be God's plan? 
 Looks like you could use a shoulder to cry on. 
 No, she does not need a shoulder to cry on,  but I do need a place to store my pool stick. 
 Maybe I'd like that. 
 Get. 
 What the hell? 
 Your problem now. 
 - Ooh. 
 - Watch it. 
 Here. 
 What am I supposed to do with her? 
 I don't know. 
 But be careful. 
 Last time she was this drunk,  you ended up with your first son. 
 Night. 
 He's not that fat, Mom! 
 Now you're cooking breakfast for us? 
 Your mom's not feeling well. 
 - Is she contagious? 
 - No. 
 Just tired. 
 Did you check her for ticks? 
 Soon as she wakes up. 
 You can check her while she's asleep. 
 Sit down! 
 Do you even know how to cook? 
 Believe it or not, I am capable of making breakfast. 
 Sorry. 
 It's not like we see you do much around here. 
 How 'bout, "Thanks for cooking, Dad"? 
 Chocolate chips? 
 Thanks for cooking, Dad. 
 Is Mom going to church? 
 I don't think she's up to it. 
 But she never misses church. 
 Are you feeling better? 
 Yes, baby, I'm fine. 
 All right, here we go. 
 Chocolate chips for breakfast and pizza for dinner? 
 I'm loving Dad. 
 Where were you last night? 
 - Out with your grandmother. 
 - But where'd you go? 
 - Enough questions. 
 - Y'all ask me questions  when I come home late. 
 Oh, I can explain that. 
 You're an idiot and we don't trust you. 
 Mom, you didn't say grace. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Come on, y'all. 
 Can I sit with you? 
 I think Mommy needs to be alone right now. 
 All right. 
 Mom, I'm scared. 
 Why? 
 You didn't go to church,  you stopped saying grace. 
 I don't understand what's going on. 
 It's kind of hard to explain. 
 Is it me? 
 Did I do something wrong? 
 Of course not. 
 Come here. 
 Sheldon... 
 faith means believing in something  you can't know for sure is real. 
 And right now, I am struggling with that. 
 So you don't believe in God anymore? 
 That isn't something for you to worry about. 
 I need to figure this out myself. 
 Can I help? 
 Maybe I could provide a fresh perspective. 
 I don't think so, baby. 
 Did you know that if gravity  were slightly more powerful,  the universe would collapse into a ball? 
 I did not. 
 Also, if gravity were slightly less powerful,  the universe would fly apart  and there would be no stars or planets. 
 Where you going with this, Sheldon? 
 It's just that gravity is precisely as strong  as it needs to be. 
 And if the ratio of the electromagnetic force  to the strong force wasn't one percent,  life wouldn't exist. 
 What are the odds that would happen all by itself? 
 Why are you trying to convince me to believe in God? 
 You don't believe in God. 
 I don't, but the precision of the universe  at least makes it logical to conclude there's a creator. 
 Baby, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but... 
 logic is here. 
 And my problem is here. 
 Well, there are five billion people on this planet  and you're the perfect mom for me. 
 What are the odds of that? 
 Oh. 
 Thank you, Lord, for this little boy. 
 I knew I could fix it. 
 Maybe it was you and the Lord. 
 I don't like sharing credit,  but I knew in that moment it wasn't the appropriate time  to say it. 
 And Jacob said: "For I have seen God face to face,  and my life is preserved."  Is this an appropriate time to mention  that John 1:18 says, "No man hath seen God  at any time." Who's right? 
 Jacob or John? 
 Let's talk about it in the car. 
 ...the Lord. 
 Yes, Connie? 
 My grandson has a question. 
 Let 'er rip, kid.
