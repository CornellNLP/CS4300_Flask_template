 Previously on Satisfaction... 
 What are you doing? This is my car. 
 Repossession. 
 How soon can you get us a presentation? 
 Next week. 
 I got the job. 
 I'm not an escort. 
 I'm just a regular guy who went a little bit crazy for a couple of days. 
 I want to go back to school now. 
 I'm really popular. 
 All I wanted was my phone back, and you still had to go and call the I.R.S. 
 Your last firm was stealing from you, about a million or so. 
 I just wanted to bring the rest of what I owe you. 
 I don't want to see you anymore. 
 Nice car. 
 This dude is totally busted. 
 I have to text my dad this right now. 
 [Phone chime] 
 [Thudding] 
 Oh... 
 Come here... 
 [Grunts] 
 Pervert! Pervert! 
 Oh! 
 [Both grunting, muttering] 
 She broke it off, man. 
 She said she doesn't want to see me anymore. 
 You were seeing my daughter. 
 Your what? 
 Look! 
 No! 
 That was your daughter? 
 You... 
 [Groans] Uhh! 
 [Coughing] 
 I didn't know that was your daughter, man. 
 She must have recognized the car or something. 
 I'm not that kind of guy, all right? 
 I thought you were talking about Grace. 
 Grace? You're still seeing Grace? 
 Time's up. You need to... 
 She owed me money, okay? Nothing happened. 
 Then why are you running away? 
 Because you had my car towed, and I can't access my bank account anymore. 
 If I cripple you, it's premeditated. 
 [Chuckles] Oh. 
 Jesus. 
 No wonder Grace was having such a hard time at home. 
 I mean, you're even more fricking clueless than she said. 
 Oh, she said that? 
 Among other things. 
 Like what? What else did she say? 
 Uh, you've been completely checked out of the marriage for, like, the last year. 
 What? The... the last year? 
 Yeah. 
 And you're emotionally unavailable. 
 S-sometimes. 
 She's a very talented woman. 
 Okay? 
 You need to support her in trying to follow her dreams. 
 Follow her dreams? 
 Yeah. 
 It's clichee. So what, man? 
 That's how she feels. 
 What... what else did she say? 
 That's all I'm going to tell you. 
 Client privilege. Oh, what-what? 
 What, are you a lawyer now? 
 It's just my code. All right? 
 Women don't come to me for just s*x. 
 It's about... It's about listening. 
 A lot of times, I know more about them than their husbands do. 
 They trust me, and I'm not gonna betray that. 
 [Car alarm chirps] 
 No. 
 This is stupid. 
 I'm not playing this game anymore. 
 You want to ruin my life because yours is so screwed up, I'm gonna ruin yours. Okay? 
 Karma is a real bitch when you piss her off. 
 And I got connections, too. 
 You're right. 
 This is stupid. 
 What if I could call off the I.R.S.? 
 I'm listening. 
 I want to know everything you know about Grace... 
 And what she said about me and our marriage. 
 You should ask her yourself. 
 No. I want the truth. 
 You call off the I.R.S., and I'll tell you what I know? 
 We make a trade. 
 Next time I see you. 
 Better not be a scratch on it.

 [pop music playing] 
 Oh, my God. Mom. 
 What? It's a good song. 
 It's not the song. 
 This chair dance, so not okay. 
 What's a chair dance? Oh, this? 
 Please, stop. I beg you. 
 Oh, come on. You do it all the time. 
 That's because I know how to move. 
 Watch. 
 What, this? 
 [Phone ringing] 
 [Music stops] 
 Oh, hey. 
 No, I'm almost there. 
 Cool. 
 Mom, can you just pull over here? 
 Why? 
 Just because you won't let me drive on my own does not mean I want to look like a total dork my first day back. 
 You're not gonna look like... 
 Mom, can you please just... 
 Sure. Not ruin your street cred? 
 Watch out for my portfolio. 
 Is today your first day? 
 That's why school's so important. 
 You know, those skills I learned in college are... 
 Hey, focus on the grades, okay? Not just the cool kids. 
 Anika! 
 Hey. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Mike. 
 Thanks for coming by. 
 You're lucky it's on my way. 
 I told the valet I'd be down in five minutes. 
 So you listened to my whole message? 
 Yeah, and I don't get it. 
 You were gunning for this guy Simon like he'd screwed your wife or something. 
 Circumstances have changed. 
 I need you to make the whole thing go away. 
 You can't exactly release the kraken and just call it back, Neil. 
 The I.R.S. doesn't work that way. 
 Look, give me your 401k. I'll invest it. 
 Just... there's got to be something you can do. 
 You know I'd do anything for you, man. 
 You practically carried me through econ in college. 
 But it took a lot to flag that guy. 
 I had to make it look like it was under my purview. 
 I know. And I'm grateful for that. 
 His file got kicked upstairs. 
 My boss is gunnin' to make an example out of him now. 
 I'm sorry. The guy's screwed. 
 Hi. 
 Oh. 
 Is Patrick around? 
 Sorry. 
 I missed my yoga class, and if I don't stretch, I feel like hell. 
 You must be Grace. 
 I'm Alex, the project manager for the remodel. 
 Oh. 
 You're so, um, so young. 
 I thought you did a really nice job on the design. 
 Thanks. 
 Sorry, I don't know why I said that. 
 It's... Patrick didn't tell me he... 
 I was gonna meet someone else. 
 I loved your use of travertine. 
 Some people think it's dated, but I say you can never go wrong with the classics in the right proportion. 
 So I was looking over our copy of your layout this morning. 
 For the future, the seating area should always face southwest. 
 Basic feng shui. 
 So we are going to need to scale back here, here, and here. 
 Uh. [Ahem] Patrick and I discussed tiling the reception area. 
 I'm sure that's before someone did an actual budget. 
 Still, this will completely... 
 Be fine. Trust me. 
 And now that you work for me, cost-cutting will be part of the job. 
 [Laughs] Work for you? 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Yeah. Uh, this is my vendor. 
 I have to take this. Hi, Sam. 
 Yeah. That would be perfect. 
 Thank you. 
 I got to tell you, this is the last thing I need, all right? 
 Did she make an appointment I didn't know about? 
 I don't know. 
 She just waltzed in here like she owned the place this morning. 
 Samantha Lipton, I'd like you to meet our other managing partner, Neil Truman. 
 It is very nice to meet you. 
 Then I'm sure Charles has told you nothing about me. 
 [Both chuckling] 
 Well, firstly, let me tell you just how excited we are that you and Charles are now part of the family. 
 You're the one who uncovered the accounting errors in his last firm. Is that right? 
 Yes. 
 Well done. 
 Thank you. 
 But I've known about those discrepancies for years. 
 I set it up that way. 
 You set it up? 
 Once a month since '97, $1 million was transferred into my personal account without my husband's knowledge. 
 And it would be in all of our interests if we were to continue that arrangement here. 
 I'm sorry, Mrs. Lipton. I can't do that. 
 [Clears throat] Neil. 
 My husband and I have been married for almost 30 years. 
 His money is my money. I understand that. 
 I'm well aware of his other women. 
 And I probably should just divorce him. 
 But I don't want to spend all the money that I can squeeze out of him on an army of forensic accountants to investigate all of the dummy corporations he set up to hide his true assets. 
 We have our secrets, but my husband and I know each other quite well in our own special way. 
 Just make the necessary arrangements to get her monthly cut. I am not going to do that. 
 Yes, you are. 
 I gave my word to Charles that I would always tell him the truth. 
 And you know what? [Whispers] It worked. 
 He's our client. 
 Now get the lady her money. 
 [Bell dings] 
 We're in charge of his finances, not his marriage. 
 Did someone... Did someone die? 
 Exactly who called you? 
 I don't know. I just heard, "come to school," and I took off. 
 Is everything okay? 
 I asked the nurse to call you. 
 Are you okay? What happened? 
 I just have a stomach thing. 
 Where's your mom? Is she okay? 
 Where... where's your dad? 
 It's her first day at the new job, and dad always has a meeting. 
 So I just thought that you'd... 
 Be there for you, which I am. 
 I am there. Here. 
 For you. 
 [Quietly] What should I do? 
 You don't have to do anything. I'll just... 
 Okay. 
 [School bell rings] 
 You know, I told your mom about feeding you all those GMOs. 
 I've pushed her for years to go vegan or at least put you on probiotics. 
 Is it okay if I hang out at your place for the afternoon? 
 My place? 
 Anika? Hey. 
 Are you going home? 
 Yeah. You know. 
 Well, Jake and Russ are hanging out with us at my house later. 
 You're gonna miss it. 
 All right. 
 Feel better, okay? 
 Can we go? 
 Shouji, we agreed. No stamp duties. 
 Not for a nominee account. 
 I can't make an exception on this particular account. 
 Well, if you're going to open the kimono and talk real shares... 
 We need more details... [Continues indistinctly] 
 Darling, I have to go. The most gorgeous man just walked into my house. 
 [indistinct response] 
 I'm giving you to Lisa. Tell your wife hello for me. 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 Remember before fiber optics, when business was just done in your own time zone? 
 You cannot address a box like this to my office. 
 You don't even know what it's for. 
 Would you rather I sent it to your home? 
 I told you I would reach out to you when I was ready. 
 It's an invite to a party, darling, not a marriage proposal. 
 I want to introduce you to some friends of mine. 
 Give you a little taste of what I have to offer. 
 I know what you have to offer. 
 Then let me put it into more relatable terms. 
 It's a networking opportunity. 
 Is that really what this party is about? 
 Isn't that what any party's ever about? 
 I made it a costume affair on your behalf, to make you more comfortable. It's just too risky. 
 I hate to break it to you, but I have far more important people in my circles who are doing a lot worse than you are and keeping much bigger secrets. 
 You don't have to decide now. You just have to come. 
 The truth is you're already wearing a mask. 
 I'm trying to help you take it off. 
 You don't have a fever. 
 I probably just need some rest. 
 You should have called me. 
 I didn't want to bother you. 
 But aunt Stephanie was totally fine with it. 
 I'm surprised she didn't make you pay for gas on the way home. 
 Did she make you pay for gas? 
 [Laughs] 
 Grace? 
 I'll be right there. 
 I just feel bad. It was your first day back. 
 [Girls, overlapping chatter] 
 She just... She drew all over everything. 
 Just... 
 You're kidding. 
 No. Didn't think anything of it. 
 Nothing. She didn't acknowledge it. 
 So... 
 How did that make you feel? 
 Awful. 
 Embarrassed. I don't know... ugh. 
 I probably don't know how this whole process works yet. 
 You know I support you, right? 
 In all of this, following your dreams. 
 Thank you. 
 Like, you... you'd tell me if you felt like I wasn't, right? 
 What are you talking about? 
 No, I want you to know that you can share with me what you're feeling. 
 Okay. 
 You better go before my husband comes home, because he's gonna wonder what you're doing. 
 I would tell you. 
 Thanks for asking. 
 Um, I had to order takeout, so it's gonna be 30 minutes. 
 And you should check on your daughter. 
 She had a bit of a rough day. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 [Phone ringing] 
 [Ringing] 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 You have a second? 
 Not really. 
 We have a small problem now. 
 I need you to bring me your tax returns for the last three years and meet me tomorrow at Mona's. 
 What's going on? 
 Looks like things aren't going to be as simple as I thought. 
 Listen, I'll text you the address. 
 I have to go. 
 I hope you're hungry. I think I over-ordered again. 
 Mmm. 
 Thank you. 
 Simon. 
 I think I'm ready for round two. 
 [Moaning] 
 [Soft pop music in background] 
 Couldn't get in touch with my accountant. 
 He's got all my files. 
 Brought you everything I had at home. 
 Hey. 
 Did Grace ever get that job? 
 She mentioned something about a presentation or something a while back. 
 She did, didn't she? 
 Good for her. 
 [Sighs] 
 This is from four years ago. 
 You don't have anything more recent? 
 What do you need with all this stuff anyway? 
 Well, 90% of audits can be resolved if you bring the right paperwork. 
 You can just write them a check. 
 But you told me you could make all this go away. 
 How much money do you have in your bank account right now? 
 Did I have? 
 About 600. 
 Thousand? 
 600. 
 What are your monthly expenses? 
 I wrote them all down there for you. 
 "Cable, rent, utilities." 
 How much do you make a month? 
 On average? 
 About 15 grand. 
 I have upkeep. 
 Oh. You bought a jet ski. 
 What about savings? 
 You have anything for retirement? 
 I'm 27. 
 So you plan on doing this for the rest of your life? 
 No. No, um... 
 Actually, I'm gonna settle down, get a desk job, a mortgage, a minivan. 
 Gonna invest in a 401k. 
 What do you think? That work out for you? 
 [Laughs] 
 What did she see in you? 
 I think you caught a glimpse of that at the tanning salon. 
 All right. 
 I'll tell you what she saw in me. 
 Someone who's fun and exciting. 
 I listen. Okay? 
 Grace's life is boring, but she isn't. 
 What does she see in you? Huh? 
 You're a guy who puts the toilet seat down? 
 I take care of her and our daughter. 
 You can't even take care of yourself. 
 What can you possibly know about taking care of a woman in a relationship past, what, an hour? 
 You were what... 20, 25 when you got married? 
 When I settle down, I'm gonna know exactly what a woman wants. 
 You got out of the game before you even learned how to play. 
 Bullshit. 
 I stepped up. 
 That's what real men do. 
 You got married young because you were scared. 
 You were scared of girls then, and you're scared of women now. 
 And you won't listen to your wife because you're afraid of what you'll hear. 
 If I'm so afraid, then what am I doing here right now? 
 This is too little, too late, if you ask me. 
 I thought you wanted to hear the truth. 
 The truth. 
 The truth? 
 The I.R.S. would have got you one day anyway. 
 Oh, so that's it? 
 That's it. 
 Oh, and if I were you, I'd invest in a good roth I.R.A. 
 Hey hey, you need to think about what you're doing here. 
 This isn't finished. 
 Yes, it is. 
 You're not qualified to teach me anything. 
 Okay, once we get that out of the way, then we'll start to lay the tile. 
 Oh, hi. Sorry, that can't come down. 
 Thanks, Marco. 
 What is the problem? 
 It's load-bearing. We can't take it out or it will compromise the structure. 
 This is a newer building, so it's redundant. 
 There's no problem taking it out. 
 No, no, I checked with the city before I... 
 Yeah, and it's gonna be fine. 
 I'm trying to give you something better than you asked for. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Is there a reason you're trying to completely cut me out of the process? 
 I'm not trying to cut you out. 
 I'm trying to do my job. 
 Well, my job was to design a space that Patrick loved, and you're changing that. 
 You can't get everything you want. 
 That's just life. 
 You're barely out of college. What could you possibly know... 
 Okay. Let's, uh... 
 Can we start over? 
 I just... are you free after work? Maybe we could grab a drink. 
 I think if we could get to know each other a little better... 
 What's the update on these two? 
 Since the show... They're still together. 
 [Knocking on door] 
 [Commotion on TV] 
 If it's a package, leave it. 
 [Knocking continues, doorbell rings] 
 [Groans] 
 [Knocking continues] 
 Hi. 
 Can I come in? 
 Of course. 
 Uh... 
 I don't have cable. 
 Aren't you supposed to be at school? 
 I still don't feel good, and I just didn't want to deal with the hassle of going back to the nurse. 
 So you skipped? 
 Do you have any food? I didn't really have breakfast. 
 You know, it's been a while since I was in high school. 
 Well, not that long. I still remember a few things. 
 There must have been a lot of fallout after what happened with the song, then getting back in. 
 And I've seen the Facebook posts. 
 It's like a shrine. Everyone loves you. 
 I bet you hung out with all the cool kids. 
 Yeah. I was popular. 
 But mostly because I was the first one in my grade to give a blow job. 
 I wouldn't recommend it. 
 Anyway, suddenly guys were asking me out. 
 Girls checked out what I was wearing. 
 Is that... kind of what it's like for you now? 
 Before, I was, like, this freak. 
 And now I'm... visible. 
 It sucked when nobody knew my name, but in a way, it was easier. 
 Now it's a pain. In the gut? 
 I know it's an adjustment, but... 
 It's great people are noticing you. 
 Being popular in high school sets you up for life. 
 You just got to do it on your own terms. 
 Like how? 
 [Crunch] 
 You're so lucky I'm your aunt. 
 [Club music] 
 Kind of loud in here. 
 What? 
 I said, it's, uh... 
 I know. 
 I was just kidding. 
 Ooh. Perfect. 
 So, uh, this is your kind of place? 
 Lately. 
 I just broke up with my boyfriend, so I'm trying to get back in the game. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Oh, we're in different places. 
 He proposed. I'm 25. 
 Who the hell does that anymore? 
 [Laughs] 
 Right? 
 You know, maybe... It's gonna be hard to talk here. 
 Maybe we could just go... 
 Hold on. 
 Oh, my God. 
 He's cute, right? 
 And he is coming this way. 
 Grace, glad I found you. 
 I wanted to congratulate you. 
 You got the job? 
 Yeah, I stopped by the building to say hello, and they told me you came here for a drink. 
 Grace, aren't you going to introduce me to this lovely gentleman? 
 Um, yeah. 
 Alex, Simon. 
 Hi, Alex. 
 Hi. 
 Pleasure to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Grace? 
 She's not here. 
 She went out with some lady from work. 
 Oh, yes. She did mention that. 
 You going somewhere? 
 Uh, aunt Steph's taking me to dinner. 
 You weren't home. Mom wasn't here. 
 Just figured if I wanted to eat. 
 Well, have you done your homework? 
 Yes, dad. 
 Well, h-how are you feeling? 
 Uh, better. 
 What? 
 [Phone rings] 
 Uh, I'll be back by 10:00. 
 [Background music, chatter] 
 Welcome. 
 I knew you couldn't stay away. 
 I've been looking forward to it, actually. 
 Have you, now? 
 And you look lovely. 
 You should see what I'm wearing underneath. 
 Absolutely nothing. 
 [Chuckling] 
 So there might be a few faces here you'd recognize if they weren't being covered. 
 But discretion is the name of the game. 
 You must know how to play by now, no? 
 Let's start in here. 
 I think I can do this one on my own. 
 I'd prefer it, actually. 
 Then by all means. 
 [Woman singing in French] 
 Oh watch it...[Laughs] 
 It was the first trip. 
 Excuse me. 
 Excuse me, love. I'm going to borrow him. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 But you have to promise to bring him back. 
 He's so funny. 
 Get her some air and remind her of the rules. 
 What are you doing? Hanging all over my guests. 
 And her? She was practically unconscious. 
 I thought that's what this party was all about. 
 You think that's what I wanted to see from you? 
 You're here because of who you are, not because of who you think I want you to be. 
 Well, I wanted to show you that I know what I'm doing. 
 But you don't. 
 That's what's so special about you. 
 Adrianna! 
 Just because you're wearing a mask doesn't mean you should be someone you're not. 
 Not yet. 
 Hi, Adrianna. 
 [Chatter, singing in French continues] 
 I see you're finally alone. 
 I've been trying to make that happen all night. 
 Now how do we celebrate? 
 I'm going to have to take a rain check. 
 Maybe next time. 
 So you two work together? 
 You said you stopped by the building? 
 Ooh, that war zone is my doing. I'm managing the renovation. 
 And what do you do, Simon? 
 I'm in the service industry. 
 Oh. [Laughs] 
 I know that line. 
 I waitressed all through college. 
 And how do you two know each other? 
 He's an old friend, family friend. 
 That's right. We, um... 
 We see each other all the time. 
 Right. 
 So you wouldn't mind if my friend and I had some one-on-one time for now? 
 Actually, I'm her boss. 
 No, we were trying to get to know each other a little better. 
 I thought we were having a really good time. 
 We can always talk about sheetrock tomorrow. 
 You should totally stay. 
 No. But... but he can't. 
 Honey, you need to relax. 
 I'm gonna go to the ladies' room, then I'll get us another round. 
 And don't go anywhere. 
 You got it. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Just give me a second, okay? 
 No. 
 I can't be seen out with you. How dare you just track me down like this? 
 Well, I need to talk to you, and you won't even return my calls now. 
 There is something you need to know. 
 You're not getting it. You're not getting it. 
 You have no idea what I need to know. 
 Okay? What? 
 You listened to my problems. So what? 
 So... so does my hairdresser. 
 Just go away. 
 Don't pull a stunt like this again, please. 
 I paid you. End of story. 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 I get it. 
 You... you must be totally happy at home now. 
 What? What... 
 Hi, Patrick. It's Grace. 
 I'm sorry to be calling so early. 
 We just have a problem down at the site. 
 No, there's gonna be no point in calling Alex. 
 I'm not sure how to say this, but, um, I don't think she's got the chops to deal with this project, and I'll tell you exactly why. 
 All right, so what's so urgent? 
 I wanted to share something with you. 
 That will be your consistent monthly returns now that I control your account. 
 This is another number. 
 Your wife came to see me this week. 
 Were you aware? 
 She's a very shrewd woman. 
 She is, indeed. 
 I was informed of something. 
 And as your financial advisor, I felt that I should tell you about it. 
 But before I do, if I do, I wanted to ask you... 
 Do you really want to know what your wife and I spoke about? 
 It won't make you happy. 
 But I can assure you that I will make sure that it never affects your bottom line. 
 I want to tell you the truth, Charles. 
 But I'm guessing that you don't care about the truth in the absolute sense of the word. 
 I mean, I know you care about what I do with your money on a daily basis. 
 You want to be happy. 
 And I'm thinking that if you knew everything that I now know, you won't be. 
 I want to see the other piece of paper, the one about my wife. 
 [Tearing paper] 
 I think you're right. 
 Not every partnership requires that we tell each other everything. 
 As long as we're both happy. 
 Then we'll be in touch. 
 You know how we met, my wife and I? 
 She was married to my best friend. 
 It's crazy, right? 
 So this is your aunt's place? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, like, none of the moms at our school works. 
 There's never anywhere to hang out during the day. 
 Is anyone else coming? 
 I don't think so. 
 Oh. Yeah, that's cool, I guess. 
 We should put on some music. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? Okay. 
 Hey, how does it feel to throw your first party? 
 Kind of weird, actually. 
 You ready to do your thing? 
 I don't know. 
 Come on, we talked about this last night. 
 You got to own your power, girl. 
 You want a shot of Tequila? 
 Okay, just checking. 
 I saw some kids sneak in a couple of beers. 
 I'm just trying to be cool for you. 
 Can't I just ease into this? 
 You didn't ease into the performance that made you a star, did you? 
 Oh, God. Come on. 
 A star? 
 Hey, people, hello. 
 Who wants to hear the rest of Anika's song? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, whoo. 
 The one she never finished singing. 
 The one she got kicked out of school for telling the truth. 
 [Laughter] 
 And got back in because her truth won out over their horsesh... 
 Crap. Crap. 
 Yeah. 
 Come on! 
 You guys seriously want to hear this? 
 All : Yeah. 
 Let's hear it. 
 Don't be a tease. 
 Play it. 
 ♪ Nobody's perfect so nobody's trying ♪ 
♪ My best isn't good enough so why bother fighting ♪ 
 No. I meant it as a metaphor. 
 You know, not literally a mask. 
 You're talking to someone who speaks in metaphor. 
 I get it. 
 I mean, like, the dedicated husband, the father, the financial advisor. 
 That's the part that I've been showing the rest of the world. 
 But I'm realizing that there's this whole other person underneath that. 
 So now you see Grace the same way, wearing a mask. 
 Well, Simon said that she needed support in following her dreams. 
 I guess I always thought that was being with me, raising a family. 
 And now? 
 Well, when we met, Grace's dream was to study design in Florence, take the Fulbright that she got in college. 
 I stopped her from doing that. 
 So you don't think the person you married is actually your wife. 
 Look, I think she's trying to be but I don't think that's actually who she is. 
 Or it's not all of who she is anyway. 
 I understand it. I just went through it. 
 I mean, I'm still going through it. 
 Well, have you asked her about this? 
 Well, I think I'm afraid of what I might hear. 
 We all have two sides of ourselves, Neil. 
 Some of us even more. 
 Some we never show anyone but ourselves. 
 Yeah, but if... if... if we, like, you know, both take off our masks, so to speak, we might not even recognize each other. 
 Maybe you should leave them on for now. 
 At least then we still know who we are.
