 Previously on Satisfaction... 
 That was it. I was going to take back control of my life. 
 Our lawyers advised us to put out a statement. 
 I'm not signing that. 
 Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in? 
 I'm sorry for the song I wrote... blah, blah, blah. 
 Can you at least try? 
 So the punishment goes away if I lie? 
 I have a service that caters to women who are looking for a man. 
 Come work for me. Not interested. 
 I know you slept with one of my clients. 
 What are you tryin' to do to me here? 
 Same thing you did to my wife. 
 Your assets have been frozen by the IRS. I'm Alex, the project manager. 
 So you two work together? 
 I'm her boss. Don't go anywhere. 
 We have a problem down at the site. 
 I don't think Alex has got the chops to deal with this project, and I'll tell you exactly why. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Morning, Candice. 
 Your 9:30 is already here. 
 Thank you. 
 Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 I was... 
 Think nothing of it. 
 Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Truman. 
 [Whispers] I'd give you a kiss, but that might be a little awkward right now, huh? 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 I have been on a desperate search for a legitimate financial advisor for some time now. 
 And given your recent promotion... 
 You're really gonna pull this stunt again? 
 Well, I made an appointment this time. 
 Under a different name, of course. 
 Now, before you say anything, just... 
 Just take a look at the number you'd be working with. 
 I've had pretty good luck managing things on my own. 
 But I simply don't have the time anymore, and there's just something about you I trust will take care of me. 
 Thank you. 
 But no. 
 Are you sure? 
 Very. 
 I'm so happy to hear you say that. 
 It means we won't have a genuine conflict of interest now. 
 She won't bite. 
 Again... 
 No. 
 You haven't even seen her. 
 You are just what she needs right now. 
 I don't need to see her. The answer is still no. 
 Why? Too busy? 
 How is the new job, by the way? 
 Whatever brought you to my door is in you, Neil. 
 You just need to let it out more. 
 [Door clatters] 
 Can I get anyone coffee or something to drink? 
 No, thank you. I actually have to run now. 
 You don't have to give up everything to find out who you really are. 
 Just an evening. 
 Thank you. 
 Can you get the door? Thank you. 
 Wait, wait, wait! Adriana! 
 Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Neil Truman? 
 What the hell? 
 FBI. We'd like to have a word with you.

 [Line ringing] 
 [Sighs] 
 She's not answering. 
 Hang up. 
 You don't want to leave that in a voice mail. 
 I'm really sorry about your car. 
 You weren't going that fast. 
 It's just that my mom never lets me drive. 
 Don't worry about it. Seriously. 
 As long as you're okay, that's all that matters. 
 You know that she is going to freak. 
 Good news is nothing's broken. 
 Oh. 
 Just some deep bruising. 
 So we can go? 
 You're the mother? 
 Yes, I am. 
 Okay. I just need a signature. 
 And if she notices any headaches in the next 24 hours just be sure to give us a call. 
 Thanks. Your dad and I will take you out for ice cream now, okay? 
 O-okay. 
 These'll be out front. 
 Was that legal? 
 We're family. 
 It's, you know, practically the same thing. 
 Look, I'll get my car fixed. 
 Your mother doesn't ever have to know. 
 She's so busy with work now, she doesn't know anything that's going on in my life anyway. 
 That's what you have a cool aunt for. 
 This is huge. Thank you. 
 Ooh! 
 That'll go away in a day or two. 
 More federal charges? 
 My lawyer said it was just a routine passenger disturbance. 
 Your lawyer sucked, Neil. 
 Preston is the best we have at the firm. 
 Well, what he did could normally be classified as a disturbance, but he actually opened the doors of the aircraft. 
 To an ambitious prosecutor, that's called seizing control of the plane. 
 It borders on the Patriot Act. 
 So they send the FIB to give me a shiny new subpoena. 
 I mean, that's a little extreme. 
 It's an election year. 
 You're lucky they 
didn't haul you off to Gitmo. 
 All right, so how do we handle this? 
 It already cost me a fortune to take this video off the Internet. 
 Last thing I need is a partner at this firm on trial now. 
 Well, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. 
 He's not a terrorist. 
 He's just some guy who went a little crazy after being stuck on the tarmac for five hours. 
 So all we gotta do is we gotta show them the other side of Neil Truman... the hard worker, the good husband, the great father. 
 The real you. 
 Now, the first thing you're gonna do is [voice echoing] you're gonna write a speech. 
 And in that speech, you're gonna apologize to practically everyone on the planet, and you're gonna beg for mercy. 
 You read the speech at the hearing, we plead guilty, [voice back to normal] and we ask for leniency. 
 Now, you do any community work? 
 What, like volunteer? 
 From a character standpoint it would help our cause if you got involved more. 
 Put a public face on it. 
 Whatever it takes. 
 Then all this goes away? 
 [Laughs] 
 If we get a friendly judge, I'm hopeful, but I wouldn't guarantee anything, not on the federal level. 
 Wait. 
 What are we talking about, like, a fine? 
 Community service with probation? 
 The way the law is written, you could be looking at some serious jail time. 
 [Laughs] 
 God damn it! 
 Come on, man. 
 Better luck next time, ladies. 
 You hiding cards under the table? 
 Yeah, look. See? 
 [Laughter] 
 Get outta my house. 
 Easy, bro. I was just playin'. Besides, you'll win it back. 
 You always do. 
 It's just this IRS bullshit. 
 Still? 
 Yeah. 
 If that was me, I'd kill that dude that sent them your way. 
 Yeah. 
 Great idea. Great idea. 
 So you still can't touch your money? 
 No. 
 Lucky for you, though, you run a cash business. 
 It's not exactly covering my day-to-day right now. 
 I told you I could hook you up with that lady. 
 I told you I don't work that way. 
 [Scoffs] What difference does it make? 
 'Cause once you go down that road, there's nothin' but trouble, I'm tellin' ya. 
 All right, gentlemen, I'm going to call. 
 And I am going to raise. 
 I'm in. 
 Let's see what you got. 
 Damn. 
 [Laughs] 
 Gotta be kidding me, man! 
 Listen, bro. 
 If you change your mind, just let me know. 
 So he wants you to do charity work? 
 Yeah, being more part of the community, you know, is something more concrete to show the court. 
 And I thought it might be something nice to do as a family. And you know, I've been thinking about getting more involved lately. 
 Studies say that true happiness comes from giving back, not from material things. 
 Well, now you're making me feel bad. 
 No, no, I didn't mean... no. You need this stuff for work. 
 Well, I'm not gonna keep it all. 
 Well, why don't you show me what you bought? 
 I can help you decide. 
 Um, [giggles] I just... 
 I thought, you know, I needed to be more hip or sexy or...

 No. 
 What do you want? 
 I want to know how I ended up here. 
 I knew there was something off in my marriage and with David, I just... I never knew what. 
 You know why? 
 'Cause it's easy to figure out other people. 
 Figuring out yourself... that's the hard one. 
 Do you ever wonder if sometimes we pick certain partners so we can hide from ourselves? 
 So we don't have to figure out who we are? 
 Now that David's not here, I'm finding all these parts of me I never even knew existed. 
 Not all of them are that great either. 
 Do you think that you would have been happier not knowing about those parts? 
 No. I think maybe if I had known, we could have stayed married. 
 I say just accept yourself, all of it, even the bad parts. 
 You know what I'm realizing? 
 It's not that he wanted me to be someone I wasn't. 
 It's that I wanted me to be that. 
 And who do you want to be now? 
 I don't know. 
 I never had to ask myself that before. 
 My two cents... do whatever feels right for you from here on out. 
 Everything else will fall into place. 
 I'm beginning to think this whole thing was one big mistake. 
 You know, maybe if I'd gotten more sleep that night, if the plane had been on time, then I wouldn't have freaked out. 
 I wouldn't have quit my job, and then I wouldn't have caught Grace and Simon together. 
 And your life would be the same. 
 Yeah, but is this who I am now? 
 Well, who is it would you like to be? 
 A better father, better husband, you know, just someone happier. 
 There is no such thing as being happy. 
 There's only what is and what should never be. 
 Is that Led Zeppelin? 
 Well, they got it right. 
 Who am I to say anything different? 
 When you can't find the words to the speech, it's because you don't believe what you're saying matches who you are. 
 Actually, I think I don't know who I am anymore. 
 That's why the words won't come. 
 Well, that is a bigger problem, isn't it?

 I was trying to be this big career woman, as if that was an insult, you know. 
 You know, she's never held a job that didn't require a name tag. 
 What does she know about a career? 
 Well, you have to grade her on a curve. 
 She has no idea what it's like to have kids.

 "I was not myself that day and have been tortured by the memory of my inexcusable behavior." 
 This is what you're gonna say? 
 [Scoffs] Then you don't want my help. 
 This is a man who didn't think it was convenient to sit on the plane like everyone else. 
 And the law is clear... create a disturbance, endanger the lives of fellow passengers, you must be punished. 
 But since the defendant has demonstrated to be a good citizen in the community, prosecution is open to hearing his statement before we consider pursuing the charges. 
 Okay, go. 
 [Sighs] 
 That was the speech that I was prepared to give today, but it just doesn't seem right. 
 I know that I am supposed to regret what happened, and I really wish I could, I really do, Your Honor, because I love my family and they need me. 
 But if I can't be who I really am... 
 Then I'm no good to them either. 
 All I did that day was stand up for common decency. 
 I certainly wasn't doing what was convenient for me. 
 I wasn't trying to start a riot. 
 I was just simply saying no. 
 No, you cannot treat people that way. 
 And I'd do it again, because that is who I am. 
 And if I can't have the courage to stand up here and be who I am, then I have nothing. 
 [Clapping] 
 Whoo! 
 [Anika continues clapping] 
 Uh, Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen, I stand here today a humble man, a contrite man, a man who deeply regrets all the pain and suffering he has caused with his foolish actions. 
 [Low chatter] 
 Well, they're taking you off the no fly list. 
 I'm still gonna have to work some magic to get the charges dropped completely, but there won't be a trial. 
 So he won't have a criminal record? 
 I think everything's going to work out, but I wouldn't even risk getting a parking ticket in the next six months. 
 Thank you for everything. 
 You bet. 
 Preston. 
 Great speech. 
 Hey. 
 You know I'm still the same person I was on that airplane. 
 Nothing's changed. 
 I just did what I had to do to keep the family together. 
 I know. 
 Sometimes you have to be a different person in a different situation to survive. 
 Does that make sense? 
 Use your blinker. 
 And remember there's a blind spot. 
 Mom. 
 Well, you can't just use the mirror, you have to look. 
 Mom, I'm looking. 
 And, honey, I want you to know everything's gonna be okay. 
 All right? Dad's gonna be fine. 
 And... and people might say stuff at school, but just don't pay any attention to them. 
 It's okay. I've already heard everything. 
 And it doesn't bother me. 
 Besides, nobody cares. They don't get it. 
 That was good. You're getting much better. 
 Thanks. 
 And, honey, I know I've been focused on my job and... and too strict about the car. 
 It's just that, you know, being an adult doesn't... doesn't mean you have it all figured out. 
 But I'm your mom and I love you. 
 So I'm gonna keep on trying. 
 It's okay, mom. I get it.
