 female narrator : Previously on Satisfaction... 
 You play? 
 I've always wanted to. 
 What's going on? 
 Hi. 
 Oh. 
 Anika! [Grunts] 
 Forget what Adriana said. 
 Women at these things don't care about what you look like in a suit. 
 They're paying for a good ride. 
 You're excused. And take your friend with you. 
 But I never said a word. 
 Oh! 
 God, I've been wanting to do that for months. 
 You told my family about the paintings. 
 Do you know anything about his father? 
 I want 'em back. 
 He's a very powerful man. 
 woman : You said you never lied to me. 
 We had a falling out when my mom died and he married Emma. 
 It's really complicated.

 Great party. 
 Hey, it's that dude, remember? 
 So I hate to crash your tour twice in one week, but this time I brought you something. 
 Black Beauty, signed by the man himself. 
 Try it. 
 I've never bought a guitar before, fact there's a lot of things I haven't done before this week, but I'm guessing that that's pretty close to perfect. 
 You like it? 
 It's yours. 
 What? 
 If we can negotiate a trade. 
 For the one that I damaged on the tour bus. 
 You want that banged up piece of sh1t? 
 Instead of this? 
 You still have it? 
 Well, would you look at this? 
 You and I at the same party. 
 [chuckles] What are you doing here? 
 Closing a deal. 
 Ah. 
 So you're here on business too. 
 Working hard, I see. 
 Yeah, well, I might get screwed now. 
 Not like that. 
 Is this him? 
 You finally made it. 
 Rebecca. 
 Hi. 
 I was hoping that was you. 
 Lisa. 
 Hi, Lisa. 
 We were just saying it's starting to get a little bit crowded in here. 
 Should we go somewhere a little more private? 
 Love that idea. 
 Could you give us just one minute? 
 Another drink? 
 Yes. 
 They think I'm with you. 
 My buddy was supposed to work with me tonight, but he just texted and had to cancel. 
 You spoken to Grace lately? 
 She made it clear she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. 
 So no. 
 It really is over between us now. 
 How you doing with everything? 
 Oh, you know. 
 Just trying to take it one day at a time. 
 Staying open for whatever life brings. 
 It's certainly full of surprises, isn't it? 
 The line at the bar is crazy. 
 And we just had a better idea. 
 [elevator dings] 
 So how did you get into the party? 
 You know the band? 
 We met at their last concert, where I brawled with security on stage and slept with their tour manager. 
 Who are you? 
 Rebecca : Come on. 
 What are you guys waiting for? 
 You know, I'm still a man down. 
 Right. Have a good night. 
 [chanting] Neil! 
 Neil : All right, all right. 
 So I haven't done one of these for a while.

 Morning, beautiful. 
 I brought you some coffee. 
 Come down when you're ready. 
 I'm glad you're here. 
 Marie, any feedback from our ambassador friend? 
 Oh, I sent her Jackson last night. 
 Rosalie : The college kid? How'd he do? 
 Marie : Apparently she couldn't physically get out of bed this morning. [Laughter] 
 Grace, join us. 
 Oh, no, I don't want to interrupt. 
 Please. It's just our weekly check in. 
 Guillermo, another plate? 
 Everyone, meet Grace. Grace, this is my team. 
 Grace is an incredible interior designer, among other talents. 
 Oh? Maybe she could throw us some ideas for tomorrow night. 
 Ah, yes. 
 We're hosting a lavish party. 
 Still tweaking our theme. 
 We have an unusual space. 
 Big pane windows, Roman columns. 
 But it's too bright in there. 
 I want it moodier somehow. 
 Well, maybe a Southern Gothic feel might work. 
 Chandelier, heavy drapes. 
 Some velvet love seats. 
 I love it. Rosalie? 
 On it. 
 You're the one who got two of our talent fired the other night. 
 Now she's gonna tell us how to throw a party? 
 Marie. 
 I hand-picked those guys myself. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Maybe you should've been a little more careful then. 
 That's a good point, though. 
 We're still down two for the party. 
 We have time. 
 Grace and I will find some replacements, won't we? 
 All right. Let's talk about this tech convention coming up. 
 Charlie, do you have the numbers? 
 Neil. 
 Neil? 
 I brought you some coffee. 
 Late night. 
 Your wife is here. 
 I thought you said my wife was here. 
 I said Simon was here. 
 He doesn't have an appointment. 
 Do you know who that is? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Since you crashed my business last night, figured I'd crash yours. 
 You got a second to talk? 
 Be there at six. 
 Yes. 
 Yeah. 
 See you then. 
 Adriana. 
 Yes? 
 I appreciate your hospitality. 
 But I'm here to design Fisher's room, so if you think I'm going to start helping you round up escorts... 
 Oh darling, I was teasing. 
 No one is asking anything of you. 
 You're my guest. 
 Make yourself comfortable. 
 Go for a swim. 
 Relax. 
 I slept great last night. 
 Well, you certainly looked peaceful this morning. 
 You know, there is, um, one thing I could use your help with if you have the time today. 
 A dress. Something very sexy, very expensive. 
 I've just come to trust your taste and I so hate to shop alone. 
 Will you join me? 
 Neil : Why are you here? 
 Minimum to invest at Bastion is $250 thousand. 
 I'm guessing there's less than five grand here. 
 It's three grand. It's your share from last night. 
 If you hadn't shown up and helped me out, I wouldn't have gotten paid anything. 
 You're welcome, but I didn't do it for you. 
 And she and I didn't sleep together. 
 Well, it's not always about the s*x, Neil. 
 You know that. 
 Look, you are the last person I ever expected to do me a favor. 
 I want you to know I appreciate it, so take the money. 
 Why are you really here? 
 Adriana has something of mine, and I thought maybe you could help me get it back. 
 I was trying to sell her some very valuable artwork. 
 She kept the pieces, didn't pay. 
 If you could just find out if she still has 'em. 
 I'm not really interested in talking to her right now. 
 Look, I gave away most of my clients when I thought I could sell these paintings. Okay? 
 If I don't get them back now... 
 Just think about it, okay? 
 I thought since we're on speaking terms again. 
 You know, you were a real pro last night. 
 I was impressed. 
 [phone buzzing] 
 Grace, come here. 
 No, I thought we were shopping for you. 
 Well, shopping is a team sport, darling. 
 Besides, you're gonna need something to wear to the party. 
 I'm not going to that party. 
 Oh. I don't understand you, Grace. 
 You know what I'm about. 
 If you aren't interested, why not just go to Italy and pursue your dreams, huh? 
 Italy was a dream I had when I was 20. 
 Is that all? 
 I know there's a part of you that's curious about what I do. 
 You have a shadow side. 
 Indulge her. 
 I won't tell anyone. 
 Excuse me. I need a gift for my assistant. 
 Like a brooch or something? 
 You don't work here. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Delicious. 
 Maybe we should invite him for tonight? 
 Is that how you do it? 
 You find some stray while you're shopping and ask him if he wants to be an escort? 
 [laughing] No, no, darling. 
 I simply make the offer. 
 He goes, meets a woman, enjoys himself, enjoys the s*x, and then I take care of the rest. 
 Was it that way with Neil? 
 I'm buying the dress. 
 Joanna. 
 The door, you still need to... 
 I haven't been home. 
 How long have you been here? 
 Not long. 
 You should've called. 
 So you could tell me not to come? 
 God, Simon. 
 You look great. 
 Now, that woman, Grace, I'm sure she told you I was here earlier. 
 She's nice. 
 You in love with her? 
 Why are you here, Emma? 
 This thing with your father. 
 It's not going away. 
 That's why you came back here? 
 To deliver a message to me? 
 No. 
 Yes, but I wanted to see you. 
 It's been so long. 
 Doesn't feel that way, does it? 
 We're not doing this again. 
 Come on. 
 I know. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I should have called you. I, um... 
 I should... 
 Hey. 
 [heavy breathing] 
 I've missed you so much. 
 Yeah. 
 [heavy breathing] 
 [grunting] 
 Neil : Scotty said you set the guitar aside for me? 
 Yeah, it's right this way. Come on. 
 What did I tell you guys? 
 It's a music video. No alcohol on the set. 
 Hey. There you go. 
 Oh, there we go. 
 Huh. 
 Nowhere near as beat up as I would have thought. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Still feels good. 
 [imaginary chanting] Neil! 
 [cheers and applause] 
 I almost forgot. 
 Who's Kate? 
 She's our publicist for the tour. 
 Lisa was raving about you last night, so much that she said she wanted to set up a date. 
 She called your friend, Simon? 
 He booked you. 
 For tonight. 
 Okay, try not to stare, darling. 
 So Paola runs a legit modeling agency, but plenty of the guys are open to outside work. 
 Not cheap, though. She takes a hefty cut. 
 Paola, bella. 
 Adriana! 
 So good to see you, bella. 
 Muah, muah. 
 [speaking Italian] Grace. 
 Ciao. 
 Carlota? Mimosas. 
 Busy today. 
 A print campaign for a cologne, a runway show in Miami. 
 Is he working for you? 
 He just came in today. 
 You like? I can introduce you. 
 We've met. I fired him. 
 Say no more. He's gone. 
 Carlota, [speaking Italian] 
 Bye, bye. 
 Adriana : Ah, grazie. 
 It's never too early for mimosas, darling. 
 [inaudible dialogue] 
 Ma'am? 
 Grace. 
 Grace. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 So, what do you need? 
 Two of your most gorgeous. Work's tonight. 
 You have to meet Nikola. 
 He just arrived from Bulgaria. 
 He used to be a Navy commander over there. 
 [phone vibrating] 
 Hello? 
 [phone clicks] 
 [phone vibrating] 
 Who is this? 
 You don't have to leave. 
 He's probably wondering where I am. 
 Could you, uh... zip me? 
 Yeah. 
 How are things between you and him? 
 Difficult. 
 He's changed, Simon. 
 He's not the same man as when you left. 
 He's... 
 What? 
 Hmm? 
 Give him back his paintings. 
 God, he had my apartment trashed. 
 You don't need to tell me that. 
 You don't understand. 
 What I don't understand? 
 You and I swore years ago that we'd never see each other again, you just show up out of the blue? 
 Because I was worried about you. 
 I've never stopped worrying about you. 
 I've never stopped... 
 Say it. 
 I was wrong. 
 You should go. 
 [car beeping] 
 Hey. 
 You want the good news or the bad first? 
 Beautiful dress. 
 Front door was open. 
 It's nice to see you again. 
 The modeling agency? 
 Adriana hired me this afternoon. 
 Okay, yeah. Hi. 
 Again. 
 She asked me to come by. 
 Here I am. 
 She's not home. I'm not really sure when she'll be getting back. 
 Want some help with that? 
 I can just... 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 I don't know why they always put the zippers where you can't reach 'em. 
 Oh, my... What are you doing? 
 Like I said, Adriana asked me to come by. 
 There's usually a test drive. 
 Get away from me. 
 Marco. I'm Marie. 
 We spoke on the phone. 
 Oh. 
 Why don't you head on upstairs? 
 First bedroom on the left. 
 I'll be up in a minute. 
 Yeah. 
 Trying to get him fired now, too? 
 He walked in on me when I was trying to get dressed. 
 Why are you still here? 
 You know you don't belong. 
 You're just some middle-aged housewife who's been dropped into the deep end and you don't know how to swim. 
 Just do us all a favor. Go home, and leave the business to the professionals, okay? Before you really get hurt. 
 
 
 
 Neil : What the hell is wrong with you? 
 Hello, Neil. Come on in. 
 You booked me on a date? 
 Yes. Kate. 
 She specifically requested you. 
 It's been a rough day. 
 I was gonna call. 
 Thought I was doing you a favor. 
 I can't help you out with Adriana. 
 I know. You already told me that. 
 So what is it you're trying to do here? 
 Look, if a client calls and I give them what they want, it's good word of mouth. 
 Her friends call. They book more dates. 
 I see a huge uptick. 
 Ah. 
 So this is about more business for you. 
 Come on. 
 You had so much fun last night. 
 I had a great time, but I don't work for you. 
 But you know the business. 
 Enough to know you have no idea what you're doing. 
 You think I don't know what I'm doing? 
 You got rid of all your clients. 
 You spent all your savings. 
 You may know how to show a woman a good time, but you do not know how to run a business. 
 Come on. 
 I want to show you something. 
 Here. 
 Can never go wrong with jewelry. 
 Give her that when you arrive. 
 What is all this stuff? 
 Gifts. 
 Helps break the ice with new clients. 
 It's how my business grew so fast when I started. 
 Paying attention to detail. 
 I know exactly what I'm doing. 
 [chuckles] 
 Oh, you got to be kidding me. 
 I got your info from the agency. 
 The modeling one. 
 They listed this as your day job. 
 What? You came here to try to get me fired again? 
 No. 
 And I told Adriana she shouldn't have asked you to leave that night. 
 It was your friend that was the problem. 
 He wasn't my friend. 
 I just happened to be standing next to him. 
 I told you. 
 And I already had to come back here begging for my job, okay? 
 You're a student? 
 Graduate program. 
 Until I couldn't afford tuition. 
 Look, I am so sorry. 
 If you don't have a student ID, you got to go. 
 Okay? 
 Well, it's temporary, but, uh... [chuckles] 
 I got it when I accepted a fellowship to study overseas. 
 Not... not happening now. Um... 
 Look, I know what it's like to get knocked down, okay? 
 And then you get up, and you get so many options and temptations, and... 
 I guess what I'm trying to say really is, um... are you free tonight? 
 Now I'm confused. 
 Yeah, well, maybe I am, too. 
 But I am also done being afraid. 
 After 20 years of holding back, I just... 
 I need to take some chances. 
 Grace : I mean, life can turn around on you so quick. 
 You don't go for what you want, you start to wonder, what if I missed my one chance at being happy? 
 Do you tell yourself it doesn't matter? 
 Or do you decide to risk everything and go for what you want? 
 I think the choice is pretty clear. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 My apologies. I thought I was on time. 
 Oh, you... you are. You are. 
 I just got here a little early so I could... nice to meet you. [Chuckles] 
 I'm Kate. 
 You are very handsome. [Laughing] 
 I hope that's all right. 
 I mean, if you're into the bald, bad hygiene types with a paunch, yeah, we have a problem, I guess. 
 Yeah. 
 I brought you this. 
 Oh. 
 Open it, please. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 You seem so surprised. 
 No, I guess I just didn't really know what to expect. 
 So, how did you get into this business? 
 You sound so formal now. 
 No, I'm just curious. 
 You know, I want some details. 
 Well, it's kind of a long story. 
 And names and places would have to be changed to protect the innocent, so... 
 Ask me anything else. [Chuckles] 
 Maybe we should just go upstairs. 
 I thought we'd have dinner first. 
 Maybe connect before... 
 No. You know what? 
 That's what I'd like. 
 Just get down to the real business. 
 Good? 
 Great. 
 So once everyone settles in, I'll say a few words and then make the introductions. 
 Ah! You decided to come. 
 Knew that dress would look amazing. 
 And your hair. 
 Well, if you're gonna commit, go all the way, right? 
 Oh, well, you're just like a bad penny, aren't you? 
 Take a spot, hon. 
 Yes, ma'am. Excuse me, ladies. 
 How did we do this time? 
 Mm, I almost kept him all to myself. 
 [chuckles] 
 Ladies. 
 You remember Chris, everyone? 
 You want to get us a table inside, and I'll be in in a sec? 
 I figured he'd come and enjoy himself and if eventually it leads to something more, you'll handle the rest. 
 I believe that's how it works? 
 When I fire someone, they're not allowed back. 
 That's how it works. 
 Then my apologies. 
 I'm still learning how to swim, so to speak. 
 Maybe you could cut me a little slack this time? 
 I'll see you inside. 
 Really? 
 I don't trust her. 
 Well, you'll need to start. 
 She's going to be part of the family. 
 Well, here we are. 
 A suite. Very nice. 
 I hate it how they make those hospital corners with the sheets, don't you? [Chuckles] 
 It's just... it's so inconvenient. 
 Oh, hey. 
 Say cheese. 
 Anonymity is sort of a rule in this business. 
 So there are rules in your business? 
 What are some other rules? 
 You seem a little nervous. 
 Me? No. No, I'm just... I'm excited. 
 First time? 
 I remember my first time. 
 I had this idea about how I was supposed to act, but... I mean, once I just took my time... 
 I'm going to go use the bathroom. 
 You don't go anywhere. 
 Where'd you hide those damn things? 
 [voice rewinding] 
 Neil : I mean, once I just took my time... 
 Kate : I'm going to go use the bathroom. 
 You don't go anywhere. 
 Neil : You're not really here on a date. 
 What's this all been about? 
 [exhales deeply] 
 I'm writing an exposé on your business. 
 I have a blog on modern relationships, and I thought, you know, that... 
 That you'd trick me into telling you my story so you could exploit it? 
 Any time money changes hands over s*x, someone is getting exploited. 
 That's a pretty general statement. 
 Look, you seem like a really nice guy, but what you do just furthers the cycle of shame and humiliation that keeps women down. 
 Why should s*x be connected to shame? 
 And what's so criminal about a successful, powerful woman who wants to have a good time and happy to pay for it? 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm on deadline. 
 "After being promised a spectacular evening of fine wine and dining, I eagerly booked the date and went to meet him at the appointed place. 
 We barely even finished a drink, let alone had dinner." 
 So? 
 The point of the experience is for us to get to know each other. 
 Then see where things lead. 
 You're assuming this was just about about s*x. 
 And you're assuming it wasn't. 
 Maybe if you told me what you were really looking for, we could discover it together. 
 [snickers] 
 What? Is that funny? 
 [sighs] 
 All right, look, you want an exposé, I'll give it to you. 
 But, you have to have some skin in the game. 
 It's only fair. 
 When was your last relationship? 
 Two years ago. 
 Why did it end? 
 [scoffs] Why do they all end? 
 Different people. 
 Different desires. 
 Have you been with anyone since? 
 This is stupid. 
 Why? 
 Because I'm not writing a story about me. 
 Well, if you want to write about me, maybe you should get to know me. 
 I'd like to get to know you. 
 And then, who knows where things may lead? 
 You know... you know, I am, um, actually hungry. 
 Maybe we should order in dinner. 
 Yeah. 
 Sure. 
 Okay. 
 Victor : I'm not saying your current firm is inept, but with 40 million in capital you should be getting a higher return. 
 You move over to Bastion, I can guarantee you 12% minimum. 
 That's a personal promise. 
 Neil? 
 He's lying. 
 You really have to stop doing that, Victor. 
 [chuckles] 
 He can't promise you anything. 
 I mean, there's no reward without risk. 
 Maybe you're better off staying where you are. 
 Change can be dangerous. 
 When you reach for the brass ring, there's always a chance that you'll miss, and fall flat on your ass. 
 But if you grab it, life can be pretty sweet. 
 Neil : So, the question you have to ask yourself is... what do you want? 
 What do you really want? 
 And how bad do you want it? 
 Talk to you soon. 
 All right. 
 Hey, Truman, I don't know how you do it, pal. 
 You just... well, you have that thing. 
 You have that thing that people trust. 
 I'm just being honest. 
 You should try it some time. 
 Okay. How's this? 
 Lose the new age crap, all right? 
 Your enlightenment is starting to make me angry. 
 Mona, can you send me the positions for the Townsend account? 
 Right away. 
 Just a moment. 
 Dana Hausdorf? 
 Put her through. 
 This is Neil. 
 Kate : Are you near a computer? 
 Kate? 
 Mona, can you jump off? 
 I'm at my computer. 
 Go to LadyWantsToKnow.com. And you should know, I have never written anything so fast in my life. 
 It just came, like, pouring out of me. 
 I posted it at 3 A.M. this morning. 
 It's already gotten 10,000 views. 
 I didn't put your name in it, but I did put your cell phone number. 
 Your business is gonna take off. 
 I don't have a business. 
 You will now. 
 [phone beeps] 
 Arthur : You used to love that one. 
 I caught you talking to her once. 
 You remember? 
 I was six. 
 I thought it was odd to have a naked woman up on the wall like that. 
 Then you get older, and you start to understand a little more about art. 
 Like how much you can get for some stolen ones. 
 5 million. 
 So I guess you just want these back now. 
 It was you I wanted back, Simon. 
 Not those. 
 When a father closes his eyes for the last time, he wants to make sure he's taken of the people he's supposed to take care of. 
 [chuckles] 
 Stage four. 
 It's everywhere. 
 Cancer? 
 God. 
 You know, I used to look at your face and see your mother's. 
 You know, I never forgave her for walking out on us. 
 Ah. 
 And then Emma came along, as young as she was, the way she made me feel... 
 What happened between you and Emma... 
 It's in the past, and I don't have much future now. 
 So... can you forgive me? 
 This house is haunted by your absence. 
 And since I am about to enter into the realm of ghosts, I would like to spend my last remaining days amongst the living.

 Glad I scratched the itch though. 
 I'm just gonna return this stuff tomorrow.

 Hey honey, it's Mom. 
 I got your things. 
 And I wanted to let you know everything's fine on this end, okay? 
 And I'm here for you. 
 Whatever you need. 
 I love you. 
 [knocking] 
 Did you forget your keys again? 
 Hi. 
 What are you doing here? 
 What are you doing here? 
 I live here. 
 Well, I was looking for Neil. 
 I'm interviewing for a job. 
 Are you both opening a new escort business?
