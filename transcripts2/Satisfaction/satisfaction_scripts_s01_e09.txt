 Previously on Satisfaction... 
 What are you doing here? 
 This isn't that far. 
 We can still see each other and work on the music. 
 Rand sponsors a mid-career fellowship with the design institute of Milan. 
 Candidates come by nomination only. 
 And I've nominated you. 
 I want my life, I want my music... 
 I want it to be great. 
 You make it great. 
 Well, cameras are installed. 
 You never told me the code for that thing, anyway. 
 It's our anniversary. 
 Dad! 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Are you a student here? 
 Did you just meet on the tour? 
 I'm her boyfriend. 
 You have absolutely no idea what it feels like to care about someone that much. 
 I'm the only only one that should see you naked! 
 What are you gonna do? 
 You know, it doesn't make any sense having feelings for her. 
 I'm tired of treating this like it's some kind of business transaction. 
 You mean more to me than that. 
 He's been lying to you for a really long time, okay? 
 He knows everything. 
 Oh, my God. 
 [Breathing nervously] 
 Anika? 
 [Burglar alarm sounding] 
 Oh, God! [Muttering] 
 Mmm! Shh! 
 Anniversary... the code. 
 Our anniversary. 
 [Whimpering] 
 [Alarm stops] 
 [Relieved sigh] 
 Grace, Grace, wait. 
 Get away from me! Get away from me! 
 This is my home! 
 Come here. Come here. 
 I'm gonna call the police! 
 I just want to talk to you! 
 No! 
 I just want to talk to you. 
 You're lying! 
 I'm not lying! 
 Let go of me! 
 Why would I lie about something like that? 
 Look at me! 
 He saw us. He knows. 
 How? How could he know and not... 
 [Simon groans] 
 How long have you known? 
 Since he confronted me that day. 
 Why would you keep that a secret? 
 I hated not telling you, and I'm sorry about that, but that's not my role, okay? 
 And you kept coming to see me. 
 I thought it's what you wanted, too. 
 And then... then I started falling for you, and I lost sight of all of the other bullshit. 
 What bullshit? My life? 
 Grace, I want more from you! 
 I'm trying to be 100% honest right now. 
 What else don't I know? 
 Huh? 
 You need to talk to your husband. 
 Oh, my God. You have to go. 
 Hang on, hang on. Listen, look at me. 
 I want to be the one to take care of you! 
 I don't need someone to take care of me. 
 I can take care of myself. 
 I'm not asking you to give your life over to me here, okay? 
 I'm asking you to try and live your life alongside me, all right? 
 Oh, I'm sorry. While you go and screw other women? 
 I'm not gonna do that if I'm with you. 
 I've always had a backup plan. 
 I can support you. 
 I can help you be the person that you want to be. 
 Hey. 
 Now that you know the truth, you have an out here. 
 Yeah. 
 None of this makes any sense. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 [Ringing] 
 [Beeps] 
 Leave, leave. 
 You have to leave! Leave! 
 All right, all right. 
 Look, I know this is crazy, okay? I know. 
 But we can make this work. 
 When you're ready, you just give me a chance.

 Um, I don't see anything on his schedule. 
 What was your name? 
 Mateo. 
 Mr. Truman. 
 Were you expecting someone? 
 He called me directly. 
 Babe, just get back to me when you get this call, okay? 
 Hey, I really appreciate you taking the time to hear me out. 
 I figured it was your lunch hour, so you like turkey? 
 I do. 
 Uh, could you get us both a drink of water? 
 Sure. 
 Wow. This is a really nice office. 
 Sorry about the mix-up back there. 
 Oh, it's all good. 
 It's not like I fit the profile of someone who works here. 
 Suit and tie, that's... that's not me. 
 Well, maybe the shoes, but even the soft leather, you know, I need a little bounce, something to push off... 
 What is it you wanted to talk me about? 
 Uh, I think we got off on the wrong foot the other day. 
 Actually, I know we got off on the wrong foot, and that's not how I want it to be. 
 Is that it? 
 No. 
 Mr. Truman, Anika is... 
 She's really got something, musically. 
 I mean, you know you get in a groove with somebody, and you're together, and you just feel like you're one with that person. It's... 
 Are you asking to marry my daughter? 
 Whoa, no. 
 No, I... I just think she's special. 
 And I want you to know that I know. 
 Good. 
 And, look, I appreciate you coming down here. 
 That's a stand-up thing to do. 
 But I'm not surprised. 
 Anika's a smart girl. 
 If she likes you, then you're probably a good guy. 
 The music thing? That's great. 
 But here's the deal. 
 If I ever catch you in my house in my daughter's bed... 
 Hey. Hey, I hear you. 
 Do you? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I mean, that's why I wanted you to know how much I respect Anika and you and Mrs. Truman. 
 Mateo, why are you really here? 
 What the hell are you doing in my house? 
 Hey! I said how did you get in here? 
 I found your spare key the first time I was here while you and Rosalie were busy. 
 Sorry. I should've asked first. I came to give it back. 
 [Munching] 
 [Keys jingle] 
 Is that all? 
 No. 
 As far as our arrangement goes, we're done. 
 As a go-between, I'm responsible for a lot of people's well-being, and when that gets threatened, I take it very seriously. 
 Oh, okay, so you're standing up for Grace Truman? 
 Is that what this is about? 
 We talked about this. 
 You had no business doing what you did. 
 You need to go. 
 Air your dirty laundry in my house? 
 I never heard of something so unprofessional. 
 Do you have any idea the position you just put me in? 
 I couldn't care less, honestly. 
 What is it about her? 
 Really, why her? 
 You could have your pick of women. 
 I mean, Grace is lovely, but isn't she a little tame? 
 I mean, for someone like you? 
 You know what? Most men, what they think they want is "different," okay? 
 Endless variety. 
 They're hard-wired, right? 
 And the answer is yes, to a point. 
 See, I've had more "different"... 
 I've had young, old, blonde, brunette, redhead... 
 Than ten men put together. 
 And I drive a nice car, and I make good money. 
 I have it all. 
 And what has that taught me? 
 Don't tell me you're unhappy. My God. 
 That there's something beyond all of it. 
 There's something beyond sleeping with a different woman every night. 
 It's not enough. I know you don't believe that, but there is something more to life, and I'm gonna find out what it is. 
 And Grace Truman is the answer? 
 You really think you know all the answers, don't you? 
 You see, I think you don't know the right questions to be asking yourself. 
 If you want Grace, why don't you go get her? 
 Really, why give up now? 
 You've got nothing to lose. 
 Maybe I can help you. 
 Are you still sure this is a good idea? 
 Well, we can't back out now. 
 You know what isn't a good idea is that tie. 
 They all were wearing them. 
 It's a financial office. They have to. 
 Man, what's the point? 
 You work all those hours, make all that money, and you can't spend your day in some comfortable clothes? 
 It doesn't make sense to me. 
 Well, then it does not make sense for tonight. 
 Just wear what you normally wear, and I need you to be yourself, or else my dad is gonna see right through it. 
 You're not the one who got confused for a marriage-proposing food delivery guy. 
 [Laughs] Delivering a lifetime of happiness in 30 minutes or less. 
 So you know what you're gonna say? 
 Absolutely. I've got it down. You? 
 A little less than absolutely. 
 This is a good plan. 
 I think so. 
 What's the absolute worst thing that could happen? 
 My old man has me committed. 
 Besides that? 
 They say no. 
 They say no, and then it's off to plan "b." 
 No big deal. 
 They won't say no. 
 Who could say no to you? 
 You're right. I'm kind of irresistible. 
 Hi, it's Grace Truman. 
 I need to talk to you as soon as possible. 
 If you could just call me back as soon as you get this message? 
 It doesn't matter what time it is, just... 
 Thank you. 
 [Dialing] 
 Hi, Anika. Can you call your mom, please? 
 And right away, not like the usual. 
 I love you, okay?

 So if you knew something that would really hurt me, would you lie? 
 You know I support you, right? 
 In all of this... Following your dreams. 
 He's been lying to you for a really long time, okay? 
 He knows everything. 
 Look at me. I want to be the one to take care of you. 
 I don't need someone to take care of me. 
 I can take care of myself, We don't have to have those petty arguments to solve our problems. We just talk them through. 
 [Moaning] 
 Now that you know the truth, you have an out here. 
 Mom? 
 Mom! 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. Oh! 
 Mom, what are you doing? 
 I'm... um... 
 Hi, Mrs. Truman. 
 Hi. 
 Did you talk to dad? He was trying reach you. 
 Uh, no. 
 Uh, mom, dad, this is Mrs. Truman. 
 Hi. 
 Hello. I'm Carl. Nice to meet you. 
 This is my wife, Loretta. 
 Hello. What a lovely home. 
 Thank you. 
 Perfect place for an ambush. 
 I'm sure you know about as much as we do. 
 Did you not listen to any of my messages? 
 Babe? 
 No, I didn't. 
 Are... oh. 
 Everybody's here. 
 Uh, you must be Carl. 
 Neil. 
 Hi. Hi. 
 I'm Loretta. 
 What's going on? 
 Uh, the kids have something important that they would like to talk to us about. 
 Okay, um, maybe we should sit down first, get to know each other while we get ready. 
 Please. 
 Excuse me. What is this presentation about? 
 Dad, you just gotta give us a chance. 
 We're here, aren't we? 
 Honey... 
 Mom, it's okay. Don't worry. 
 I just want to know what's so important that we can't discuss this at home first. 
 Because we thought it would be better this way. 
 We're gonna be right back. 
 Well, um, would anyone like a glass of wine while we chew our fingernails off? 
 I would. 
 You don't have to go through that trouble. 
 Oh, no, no, no, it's no trouble. 
 Babe? Do you want me to do it or...? 
 Oh, no, I'll get it. 
 I'll give you a hand. 
 Thank you. 
 Uh, please have a seat. 
 Thank you. 
 Uh, Grace and I didn't really get to talk before, so, you know, that's why she's a little... 
 Um, but you know what it's like, trading messages all day, just, whoosh. 
 Loretta and I share an office. 
 We really don't have that problem. 
 Oh, what do you do? 
 Psychologists. We have a practice together. 
 Your daughter seems very sweet. 
 I know Mateo is really into her, from what little we've heard. 
 That's nice. 
 She's still in high school, is that right? 
 Yes. 
 You know, Mateo's graduated and on his own. 
 I know they have a lot in common musically, and I heard their demo. 
 It's really good. 
 I'm sorry. How old is he? 
 Mateo's going to law school? 
 We've talked about it. 
 We've already set some money aside. 
 He's a very smart kid. 
 Oh, right. 
 Uh, what about his music? 
 Loretta and I agreed to him having this gap year, having a little fun, but you can't make a career out of that. 
 Is your daughter looking into colleges yet? 
 Oh, she's just starting. 
 I hope you put some money aside. 
 Carl, they have that island in the kitchen like I was talking to you about. 
 Such a great use of space. 
 It has so much storage. 
 Okay, my mom is drinking wine, and she's much more agreeable on wine. 
 Was my dad drinking? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 [Exhales] How we doing? 
 Good, good. 
 Did you download this? 
 No, I already had the template. 
 I just made some tweaks. 
 I did a pre-law summer symposium thing in high school. 
 Why? 
 Da-da-da da-da. 
 "Good faith decision on artist's option for renewal within five business days... Force... [Mispronouncing] Majeure"? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I didn't say that right, did I? 
 It's close enough. 
 Yeah. Ahem. 
 My stomach is churning like mad right now. 
 My parents always stressed to me growing up that it wasn't about what you did for a living, it was how you did it. 
 I'm not blind to what they've done for me, the sacrifices. 
 But towards what end, you know? 
 [Mateo's voice fading] I work harder at this, I'm better at this. 
 I'll make them way prouder strumming a guitar than I ever will being some unnamed partner at Smith, Smith, Jones, and Lieberstein. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Anika vomiting] 
 You okay? 
 [Water running] 
 Just a little private school tuition guilt right there. 
 I'm fine. 
 Are you sure you can do this? 
 Oh, my God, totally. Yes. 
 We could just tell your parents you're pregnant. 
 "The nature and scope of parental influence and its association with academic self-regulation." 
 [Both laughing] 
 I'm surprised you remember that. 
 Just a fancy title for how parenting affects your child's future. 
 Carl helped me with my thesis when we were at grad school. 
 I was trying to get her to go out with me. 
 It worked. 
 They run a psychology practice together. 
 Oh, really? Both of you? 
 Uh-huh. 
 That's nice. Do you see couples at all? 
 All the time. 
 And what are some of the, um, biggest issues you come across with couples? 
 It boils down to communication. 
 Everyone has different issues. 
 You'd be surprised how much of it revolves around finances. 
 Intimacy. 
 I'm sure. 
 I just think that you can't take your partner for granted, you know, and you have to work on your marriage every day. 
 That's very true. 
 We're coming up on celebrating our 20th soon. 
 Oh, congratulations. 
 Yes. 
 Is Anika your only child? 
 Yes. 
 We wanted more, but it just wasn't in the cards. 
 They don't need to know that.

 Um, I'm sorry. Where's my manners? 
 Would someone else care for more? 
 I'm sorry. Where's my manners? 
 I sh... yes, please, uh... 
 Um, Grace? 
 No, thank you.

 Do you mind? I'm just gonna... 
 Please. 
 Just go check in. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, what... 
 Are you okay? 
 You have to make them leave. 
 Make them leave? 
 Yes, it's not a good time for this, okay? 
 Just... And we have to talk. 
 Did something happen at work? 
 I mean, I tried calling you three times. 
 You normally text. 
 No, work is fine. 
 Did you know Mateo brought me lunch at the office? 
 Scared the hell out of me. 
 You know, I thought he was gonna ask to marry our daughter. 
 I know, this is weird, right? 
 Anika hasn't told you anything? 
 No. 
 Well, you don't think she's pregnant, do you? 
 No, she's on the pill, Neil. 
 What? 
 Oh! 
 How long have you known that? 
 She told me when we got back from college, and I was trying to figure out a way to tell you, and... 
 Jesus, Grace. You don't think that's something you should have told me right away? 
 Screw you, Neil. 
 Where the hell did that come from? 
 Oh, my God, I'm s... 
 Look, I didn't even know she was having s*x yet. 
 I don't know. I can't do this. 
 What is going on with you? 
 Grace? 
 What's that doing out? 
 Grace? 
 What is the suitcase doing out? 
 I don't know how to say this. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Neil, I... 
 We're ready. 
 What are you guys doing in here? 
 We're just talking. 
 Well, we're ready. 
 Maybe we should let them finish. 
 No, it's fine. Everything's fine. 
 We can talk later, okay? 
 Are you coming? 
 Honey, can I, um... 
 Can I talk to you for a second? 
 Can it wait till after? 
 Before you read it, we want you all to know that we really did our homework. 
 And we want you to know that we love you and appreciate you, and this was not easy for us. 
 So, um, we know that you guys have ideas about what our lives should be. 
 For instance, mom, dad, you want me to go law school. 
 But we want to ask the question, what if the ideas that you guys have for our lives... 
 What if that's not what our life is supposed to be? 
 Where are we going with this? 
 Dad, let her speak. 
 We're just trying to say, shouldn't we be allowed to discover on our own who we want to be and what our future looks like? 
 It's a big part of growing up. 
 And you only get one life. 
 Mom, your passion was designing, and in college, that's what you wanted to do, and it's 20 years later, and that's still what you want to do. 
 What's your point, honey? 
 That you have to follow your dreams, because they're not gonna give up following you. 
 And that brings us to our next point... 
 [Voice fading] Yes. So look at the packets. 
 There's a lot of information but we kind of wanted to walk you through each page. 
 
 
 
 [Soft music] 
 Babe? 
 Babe, have you seen my blue polo? 
 I'll help you look for it. 
 Babe, we're packing for two weeks, not two months. 
 I don't know. We might just love Italy so much, we never come back. 
 Non sarebbe meraviglioso? 
 [Laughs] Be serious. 
 I'm very serious. 
 Grace, this is your dream trip, okay? 
 I told you, I want you to enjoy yourself, and I'm not gonna put any limits on how much fun we can have. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 That's probably the car to the airport. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Neil, hi. 
 Anika's not here? 
 No, she must have gotten stuck at school. 
 You know how she is with appointments. 
 Yeah. 
 I'll go finish packing. 
 Okay. 
 You must be excited. 
 Yes, I am. 
 Well, it's partly a research trip as well. 
 Yeah, I didn't tell you. 
 I have this big new design project I'm working on. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. It's a boutique hotel. 
 Wow, your career has just... 
 Good for you, Grace. 
 I know Anika's really looking forward to spending some time with you while we're gone. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 So how are things with you otherwise? 
 You know, everything? 
 Good. They're good. 
 You? 
 I'm good, yeah. 
 [Somber music] 
 I'm happy for you, Grace. 
 I really am. 
 You're living your dream. 
 20 years later. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 [Cell phones beep] 
 Oh. 
 Anika. 
 And there she is. 
 Uh, and she's at my place, which I probably told her to do and I just forgot, so, um... 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, hey, uh, you guys have a great trip. 
 [Door closes] 
 Babe, what are you... What are you doing? 
 Oh, I just decided. 
 We don't want to be hauling around all this baggage, so let's just buy all new clothes when we get there. 
 We'll make it fun, reinvent ourselves. 
 It's what you wanted, right? 
 It is. 
 Yeah. 
 [Distant sounding] Mom? 
 Mom? 
 Mom? 
 Mom? 
 I'm sorry, I must... I must have, uh... 
 What did you say? 
 I told you they were gonna ask for money. 
 That's all you heard? This is about money? 
 All right, so let me understand this. 
 You would each like us to sign over your educational accounts that we've been funding for years, so you can go and play at the... the... what festival? 
 The march lawn festival, and that's only one part of it. 
 After the festival, we want to self-promote and go on tour, which is gonna be at least six months. 
 Which is why we need the money, for travel and places to stay and food. 
 Six months? 
 Okay, wait, Anika, Mateo, so what I hear you saying is that feel entitled to the money we set aside for your college education so you can use it to start a music career. 
 Mateo, you are going to college. 
 That's a future you want, not what I want. 
 Or me. Us. 
 Your mother and I did not work as hard as we did to provide you with a future so you can throw it away on a fantasy. 
 Honey, you need to consider everyone involved here, not just yourselves. 
 We did. 
 That's why we put together this whole presentation. 
 Think of it as an investment. 
 We'd be happy to sign a note that specifies repayment at a fair interest rate... 
 No, no, no. 
 I don't want you signing any promissory notes, even to us. 
 We're doing this, whether you help us or not. 
 Anika, you're too young to make this decision on your own. 
 Well, then I'll emancipate myself. 
 Then you can't say anything about it. 
 All right, show's over. 
 I assume that we're all in agreement here? 
 Great. The answer is no. End of story. 
 You set this money aside for me. 
 I should be able to use it for what I want. 
 Are you going to say something? 
 We will talk about all this when we get home. 
 And you are going to focus on getting an education so you can get a real job and not waste your life away. 
 Like you're doing? Have another glass of wine, dad. 
 Mateo. 
 Don't you disrespect me. 
 You want me to follow your dreams, not mine. 
 Come on, Mateo, this is no different than the last time you tried to run away with what's her name. 
 With Tatiana, whatever. 
 Dad. 
 Look. Look, I thought you two were still together. 
 You were practically living with her. 
 Who... who's Tatiana? 
 She's... she's no one. 
 Dad, you're drunk. 
 I'm drunk? 
 Okay, enough. 
 Who is Tatiana? 
 She's no one. 
 Was she that the girl that I saw you with that night? 
 Are you still seeing her? 
 It's not what you think. 
 Well, if she was no one then why would you hide her from me? 
 I wasn't hiding it, I just... 
 No, no, I trusted you, and you're making me feel like an idiot! 
 I would never do that to you. 
 You are, right now in front of my family! 
 I care about you, so stop. 
 That's bullshit, Mateo! 
 If you really cared, then you would have told me the truth! 
 I-I... I... 
 I'm sorry. 
 What are you apologizing for? 
 Because... 
 Because you're a dick, and ruin everything! 
 All right, okay let's just all... 
 Watch your mouth! 
 Settle down. Let's all... 
 Have I lost my mind? 
 Mateo, step back, step back. 
 Yes, you have. 
 Tell me you have something to drink. 
 When you want to feel good, drink like a Russian would. 
 There's a bar down the street. 
 Oh, I'm not going until you hear me out, darling. 
 Za zdorove. 
 Okay... 
 Just because you have s*x with a bunch of married women, doesn't mean you get insight into their relationships. 
 Those women... All women, really... 
 They won't tell you everything, despite what your ego would have you believe. 
 The simple fact is, even if she wants to be with you, a wife is never gonna leave the man she married unless she finds out he's not the man she fell in love with. 
 Get to the point. 
 The point is, you can be married to someone for years and have no idea who they really are. 
 Grace doesn't know who Neil is. 
 What do you know about Neil Truman? 
 We met, oh... 
 Oh, right about the time you lost your red phone. 
 How do you know I lost my phone? 
 I don't allow smoking in here. 
 I also know he slept with a woman who was supposed to be your client. 
 Mallory, was it? Her husband just found out. 
 Very upsetting. 
 What else do you know about Neil? 
 Enough to know that he commands absolute top dollar from my clients. 
 Neil Truman... 
 Grace's husband... Works for you? 
 Well, I'd categorize it as more of a collaboration. 
 You've got to be kidding. 
 Why would he do that? 
 Maybe because he has it all? 
 Beautiful wife, loving daughter, nice home, good job? 
 Well, guess you don't know something's missing in your life until you find something you want. 
 You can relate to that, huh? 
 So to get back to your earlier point about the right questions... 
 Here's the only one I ask myself, and it's the only one I think makes any sense. 
 You ready? 
 "What's in it for me?" 
 If you start there, then you really do have all the answers. 
 I'm just supposed to take all this as gospel from someone like you? 
 Simon, men aren't the ones who leave. 
 70% of divorces are initiated by the woman. 
 Look it up. 
 So if Grace is what you want, just go tell her who she's married to. 
 Hey. 
 [Sniffling] Sorry. 
 I had to get out of there, or else I was gonna hit him. 
 It's okay. 
 [Crying] That was so embarrassing. 
 No, you have nothing to be embarrassed about. 
 You're just both young. 
 You're gonna make a lot of decisions that... that won't work out. 
 It's part of growing up, okay? 
 Can I tell you something? 
 Mm. 
 Um, I'm almost relieved. 
 Mateo's like my first real boyfriend, and I like him a lot, and our connection is insane. 
 But I just wanted to play music. 
 I didn't want to actually run away and leave you guys. 
 Not yet, anyway. 
 And I really did not want to upset you. 
 Ohh. 
 I love you. 
 It's okay. I love you, too. 
 I love you, too. 
 [Sniffling] 
 I didn't... I didn't know you still needed me that way. 
 It's just... it's been so crazy around here lately. 
 Like, you're busy working now, and dad had that freak-out on the plane, and now he's never here, and when you guys are together, you seem weird with each other. 
 Really? We do? 
 Is there something going on? 
 No, we... 
 We're just, um... We're just... 
 You go through changes when you get older. 
 It's not that different than what you go through. 
 You know, we're just... we love each other very much still. 
 Are... 
 Are you getting a divorce? 
 No. 
 Are you sure? 
 Anika. 
 I'm just... I'm just saying that I would be fine with it. 
 I mean, I could handle it. 
 No, I couldn't. I would be devastated, actually. 
 You don't have to worry about us, okay? 
 But I do. 
 [Outside] You better start showing me the respect I deserve! 
 Why can't you just believe in me? 
 They're gonna kill each other. 
 We should probably go back out there. 
 [Outside] I'm not one of your little friends. 
 Yeah. 
 You're gonna have to accept that I'm my own person now. I'm 18. 
 It doesn't make you an adult, Mateo. 
 I'm more of an adult than you are. 
 At least I have self-control! 
 We sacrificed everything for you! 
 He doesn't deserve what he's got. 
 You don't need to attack him. 
 Neil, I am sorry you have to see this. 
 I think maybe we should just all separate for a bit, take a moment to calm down. 
 Mateo, why don't you step outside for a second? 
 I'm totally cool. 
 Oh, yeah, 'cause that's what it's all about, right, Mateo? 
 Huh? Being cool? Just stop! 
 Stop! 
 I'm just so tired of you holding this over his head when he didn't do anything! 
 You're right. 
 This has nothing to do with you. 
 What are you doing? 
 You tell him the truth. 
 The only reason you're so upset is because you're not being honest. 
 Go ahead. 
 Tell him why you really don't want to give him the money. 
 Don't make this about him. 
 What are you talking about? He's not being honest? 
 Explain to him what the gap year is really about. 
 Are you really gonna do this? 
 What is she talking about? 
 There is no money. 
 There's no money? 
 Your father spent the money. 
 I earned it. 
 He wasted it. 
 Dad? 
 We put it aside for you, we can do what we want with it. 
 "We" didn't spend it. 
 You hold this dream you had for him, and all the while, you're the one who couldn't follow through, and now you want to blame it on our son. 
 Well, I can't support that anymore. 
 Is that true? 
 Money or no money, it doesn't change the way I feel about this. 
 Wait. 
 They keep us hostage to our fortune. 
 I'll be in the car. 
 I just couldn't hold it a secret anymore. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Maybe I should have.

 Hey, I know it's been a while. 
 I'm gonna need to call in that favor now. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 [Beeps] 
 Hello? 
 I never heard back from you about my offer. 
 What the hell are you doing calling this number? 
 My wife could've picked up this phone, my daughter. 
 I wanted to apologize for making the offer. 
 I know what you have to deal with in your regular life, and if I made you uncomfortable, I'm sorry. 
 But can you really blame me for wanting you all to myself? 
 Hello? 
 I have to go. 
 Absolutely nothing. 
 And through it all, you're the only one... 
 You think they'll work it out? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm sorry I didn't tell you she was on the pill. 
 You should never be afraid to say stuff like that to me, Grace. 
 Anything, really. 
 You know that's not true. 
 You're right. 
 It's not. 
 I think we should... 
 We should go talk to a therapist. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Okay.

 Hmm? 
 Can, um... Can I borrow the car? 
 What do you want the car for? 
 Where are your keys? 
 You can't have the car. 
 I have to go to work. 
 Okay, well, it's Saturday, so... 
 Ask your mom. 
 Uh, she's not here. 
 What time is it? 
 Can I just borrow some money for a cab then? 
 A cab to where? 
 I'm, uh... I'm just going to go downtown. 
 Aah! Jeez. 
 You need to come out here, man, like, now!

 The water's running straight into my yard. 
 Must be a crack in the lining or something. 
 No, how could that happen? 
 I don't know, but you better do something quick. 
 This much water seeping into the ground can unsettle the foundation on your home, not to mention what it's doing to my yard. 
 No, I'll get someone right away. 
 This does not look good.
