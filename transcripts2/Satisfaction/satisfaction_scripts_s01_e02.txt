 Previously on Satisfaction... 
 I know why you're in such a funk. 
 Mid-life crisis. 
 No, this feels bigger. More universal. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 None of what I do really matters. 
 We don't contribute anything to the world in any meaningful way. 
 I hate this job. 
 Then you're gonna get on your knees and thank me for not firing you right now. 
 I need people with real life experience. 
 And frankly, it sounds like you've had a pretty normal life. 
 What's your name? 
 Grace. I'm married. 
 I'm Simon. 
 Your wife pays me. 
 What? For s*x? 
 I'm going to expel her. 
 What? For the song? 
 Adriana. 
 Simon. 
 Charles Lipton. 
 Maybe you'd like to take a look at my portfolio. 
 Come work for me. 
 I'm not interested. 
 I don't want my job back. 
 Good. 
 'Cause I'm offering you something better. 
 Partnership. 
 I know you have my phone. 
 What are you trying to do to me here? 
 Same thing you did to my wife, I think. 
 Is it on? Good? 
 I think it was the happiest day of my life. 
 Take us into our new house! 
 Sure, there was my wedding. 
 And the birth of our daughter... 
 Oh, my... look at this! 
 But there's just something about walking into your first home, all those dreams you see taking shape. 
 I'm thinking pool. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Funny thing is I fought Grace like hell. 
 Before we finally made the offer. 
 It was so out of our price range. 
 Mmm. Off to... 
 But she had this vision. 
 She said that the money would come. 
 The master bedroom! 
 We were gonna grow old together in that house, you know, raise a family, be happy. 
 Break it in? 
 Break it in! 
 And that's what I wanted. Really good. 
 It was the American dream, if that even exists anymore. 
 But that day, I totally believed in it. 
 We both did. 
 We believed in each other. 
 I think it was the best s*x we have ever had. 
 Am I boring you? 
 Now, what does this have to do with the part about the hooker? 
 Escort, that's more the industry term. 
 Anyway, no, well, my point is that after that, everything changed. 
 You know, between the pressures of work and raising a family, you know, we just... we haven't been ourselves in so long. 
 And that's an excuse for all that's happened now? 
 No, no, no. I still hate her for what she did. 
 But I guess I did I have that big freak-out on the airplane. 
 Oh, and that having s*x for money, that part as well? 
 Right. 
 So you're kind of even now, huh? 
 Well... 
 And you're worried about this guy Simon? 
 I made a few phone calls. 
 Simon's not gonna be a problem anymore. 
 Well, he wasn't your problem in the first place. 
 Yeah, but I... I still love her, you know? 
 And yes, I could come clean about everything, but then we'd be in therapy. 
 We'd probably get a divorce, divide the house, divide our friends. 
 Anika would be a mess... 
 Yeah, but you can't ignore what happened. 
 I know. But no, no, no. 
 I... I want to embrace it. 
 In some ways, things have been better. 
 I feel alive again. 
 I want to love my wife the same way we did when I walked into that house. 
 And... and I've learned so much through this whole experience. 
 I don't want it to end. 
 Is that weird? 
 A little, yes. 
 You really want me to help you? 
 That's why I'm here. 
 Okay, then, uh, let's try something. Sit. 
 Yes. Now, close your eyes. 
 Now, try to relax and focus on your breathing. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Ah, this is meditation. Right. 
 No, I've, uh... 
 Ahh. 
 Clear the mind to get in touch with your deeper self. 
 No, you know, I've actually been... 
 I've been reading up on the benefits of this. 
 Actually, you know, I should be actually doing this once a day... 
 Okay, now, open. 
 Meditation offers you great benefits, but honestly, you have bigger fish to fry. 
 Did you just get that from my jacket? 
 Yes, and I texted your wife and told her you want to meet her real soon. 
 No, no, no, no, no. You texted her from Simon's phone. 
 Now she thinks that he wants meet with her. 
 I... I can't meet up with my wife and pretend to be Simon. 
 If you want to fully embrace this new person you're becoming, then you must follow the path that lay before you. 
 It's the only way you're gonna get all the answers you're looking for. 
 I have high hopes for you, Neil.

 You sure you don't want to stay for dinner? 
 Oh, honey, I would love to. 
 Unfortunately, I have a board meeting in about an hour. 
 Mm, well, if you change your mind once you get there, my schedule is free. 
 All evening. 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh, my God. 
 You are so bad for me. 
 You didn't tell me you lost your phone. 
 It was just a crazy week. 
 And I'm gonna get it back. 
 There's not gonna be any problems. 
 I just need you to write me a check, that's all. 
 And if you want to go ahead and book another appointment, then we can just... 
 What... what's wrong? 
 Isn't that yours? 
 [Gasps] 
 Hey! No! No! 
 Easy, chief. 
 What are you doing? 
 This is my car. 
 That's your car? 
 Yes. 
 You're Simon? 
 Yeah. 
 Repossession. 
 No. What are you talking about? 
 I just made a payment on this. 
 This is bullshit. 
 Take it up with the bank, okay? 
 Trust me. 
 [Door closes] 
 Oh, wow. 
 I really... I can't thank you enough for this opportunity. 
 [Laughs] It was such a horrible interview that day. 
 I didn't think he liked me at all. 
 Well, Leon's a friend of mine, but he can come off that way. 
 He said you had a great portfolio, though, and you just needed somebody to give you a chance. 
 Wow. 
 I see so much potential here. 
 You know, it's funny. 
 A few years ago, we were just a small startup in my college dorm, and now, we have a building. 
 Well, you know, you work hard and follow your dreams, and good things happen. 
 How soon can you get us a presentation? 
 Next week. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Hey, the sooner the better, okay? 
 Thank you. 
 We're really counting on you. 
 Okay.

 This is Neil. 
 Hey, babe. 
 Hi. 
 So I had a meeting with that startup company today, and guess what. 
 I got the job. 
 The design thing? 
 For the lobby. 
 I mean, technically, I have to put together a presentation, they have to approve it, but they're really eager for me to get started. 
 Isn't it great? 
 Oh, that's amazing. 
 Do you know where the charger for the video camera is? 
 Neil? 
 I'm listening. 
 Do you know where the charger for the video camera is? 
 You know what? I have a really important meeting that I have to prepare for, so, um, can we talk about this later? 
 Sure. 
 I should be home for dinner. 
 Okay, see you then. 
 Yeah, bye. 
 Neil here has been a star at the firm for a long time. 
 Congratulations are in order. 
 A new partnership. 
 Speaking of which, did your lawyers have a chance to go over the client agreement... 
 I want to hear what Neil has to say about my portfolio before we talk about signing any agreements. 
 So what do you think? Room to grow? 
 We get more aggressive? More adventurous? 
 [Charles' voice echoing] 
 [Moaning] 
 Neil? 
 Neil? 
 Yes, absolutely. 
 Okay. I thought you were excited for me to be here. 
 Oh, he is. 
 We are. We are very... 
 No, you didn't let me finish. 
 I mean, it's one thing to hear it from Victor, but your wife assured me you couldn't wait to start making me some money. 
 I called her right after you and I spoke. 
 Because I had to be sure that the cryptic guy that I met at the party was serious about helping me. 
 She said you were chomping at the bit. 
 You spoke to Grace? 
 Who's Grace? 
 That's... that's Neil's wife. 
 She said her name was Adriana. 
 [Doorbell chimes] 
 Neil Truman, you found your way back to me. 
 What a surprise. 
 Come in. 
 Would you like anything to drink? 
 No. Thank you. 
 Sweetie, would you grab us water and some ice please? 
 Sit. 
 I just came from a meeting with Charles. 
 Ooh, sorry, it was probably a bit of a shock, huh? 
 You almost cost me my job. 
 Imagine my surprise when he called me. 
 It didn't even make sense. 
 The longer he spoke... 
 What did he say? 
 Something about your uncanny ability to show profits in a down economy. 
 You know what I mean. 
 Like on a more personal level? 
 Mostly the boring stuff. 
 But I did go online and come across this video of you on a plane. 
 Riveting. 
 I was having a bad day. 
 Yeah. 
 Look, I appreciate you covering for me like that, but... 
 Professional courtesy, you don't have to thank me. 
 Discretion is part of the arrangement. 
 So we can just forget everything that's happened and just let it go. 
 Well, I think you at least owe me an explanation. 
 I did just lie about being your wife in order to save you a career-changing opportunity. 
 Yeah, well, we'll see about that. 
 I want to know more of your story, Neil. 
 It's complicated. 
 You know, I got quite a few calls after that party, not just from Charles. 
 There are at least half a dozen dates I... 
 I told you, I'm not interested. 
 You didn't let me finish... 
 No, I'm not an escort. 
 I'm just a regular guy who went a little crazy for a couple of days. 
 And got paid for it. 
 See, I think you're a regular guy who went crazy for a few decades, then finally started getting your wits about you. 
 Marriage? Monogamy? 
 Drive anyone insane. It's not who we are. 
 [Ice clinking] 
 This heat wave is unbearable. 
 Look, I'm going to go. 
 Do I still need to worry? 
 How are things at home since our date? 
 With your wife? 
 Bring a little excitement back? 
 I won't say a word to another soul about you if you just tell me how things have been since our date. 
 They've been great. 
 You're welcome. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Alarm beeping] 
 sh1t. 
 Grace? 
 In here. 
 Whoa. 
 I forgot to set the timer. 
 Oh. 
 I'm so glad you're home. 
 Mm. 
 I really need your help. 
 Okay. 
 I've been working on this all afternoon, and I'm just... I'm... I'm stuck. 
 Look. What do you think of these for a color palette? 
 Or... or something... Maybe something like this? 
 Right? I mean, you're always good at giving me your opinion. 
 All right, I'm finished. 
 You guys wanna hear it? 
 "Dear Dean Miller, I'm sorry for the song I wrote. It was wrong. I really like oak roots academy"... 
 I can make that "love" if I need to... 
 "And it won't happen again," blah, blah, blah, blah. 
 "Sincerely"... 
 Okay, Anika, we said they're not going to even consider letting you back in until you can apologize properly. 
 Then they shouldn't let me back in. 
 You're the ones who want me to do this. 
 I didn't agree to anything. 
 Can you at least try? 
 Why? The school covered up the affair. 
 How come when I tell the truth, I get punished? 
 You're not being punished for telling the truth... 
 Yes, I am. 
 She is. 
 Neil! 
 So the punishment goes away if I lie. 
 Right? 
 [Sighs] I hate you guys. 
 I think we should be really proud of her. 
 I mean, we actually raised a daughter who's willing to speak her mind and stand up for her beliefs. 
 Yeah, but what she did hurt a lot of people, Neil. 
 Yeah, but what are we teaching her if we're forcing her to apologize for exposing the truth? 
 That people's private lives are private. 
 She should just learn when not to say anything. 
 Like, when to lie. 
 If it's going to do more harm than good. 
 So if you knew something that would really hurt me, would you lie? 
 What do you mean? 
 You know, I mean, like, would really upset me, would you not tell me? 
 It depends. 
 On? 
 I guess, if... if I didn't think you really needed to know. 
 I mean, right? What about you? 
 I'd probably do the same thing. 
 I guess I just... I think Anika should just understand that sometimes telling the truth can have huge consequences. 
 I mean, this can keep her out of college and... 
 And I get a 16-year-old's point of view of wanting to rebel, but we're the parents, so we should show her what the right thing to do is. 
 Lead by example. 
 Yeah. Exactly. 
 I'm gonna stay up a bit and try to get this work done. 
 You still need my help? 
 No, I think I can manage. 
 Don't wait up.

 I'm looking at it right now. 
 The money is in my account. 
 Yes, Mr. Woodley, but the reason the car payment didn't go through is that your assets have been frozen by the IRS. 
 They've been what? 
 We've been told by the IRS to comply with an audit request. 
 They control all your assets now. 
 Why would the IRS all of a sudden want to... 
 Hello? Sir? 
 Mr. Woodley... 
 [Knocking] 
 Who is it? 
 [Doorbell chimes] 
 What? 
 Jesus, Steph, it's noon. What, are you still sleeping? 
 How did you... 
 The patio door. 
 You leave it open. 
 I need your help. 
 So what are you looking for? 
 Cool and mellow? Strong and energized? 
 Happy? Comatose? 
 Looks like you can open your own little store. 
 I was thinking about doing that. 
 I have friends making a good living selling this. 
 It's a legit business. 
 Okay, I just need pot. 
 Grace, it's a little different than when you were in college a million years ago. 
 You got to get more specific. 
 Okay, it's for creative issues. 
 The new job? 
 Yes. 
 Mm. 
 I'm having writer's block. 
 Look at you, getting all artsy in your old age. 
 You know what, I smoked a lot in college. 
 It's actually how I passed all my midterms. 
 Only you would get high to try and get better grades. 
 Okay. 
 [Humming] Let's see. 
 This. 
 Whoa. [Gasps] 
 This is really strong stuff. 
 There's a whole science behind it now, so promise me you'll go slow. 
 Yes. 
 And I'm gonna need a pipe too. 
 Pipes are for hippies. 
 Yeah, I'll lend you my vape. 
 Vaporizer. 
 You're so gonna thank me. 
 Son of a bitch! 
 It's not over yet. Just take it easy. 
 Take it easy? Take it easy? 
 [Phone rings] 
 
 
 
 Oh, just... 
 There you go. 
 Feels good, doesn't it? 
 Oh, this is funny to you? 
 No... 
 It's all a big joke to you, huh? 
 That's not how I... 
 His lawyer said he doesn't want to sign, Neil. 
 Huh? I can't even get Charles to return my calls. 
 You spooked him in that meeting. 
 He doesn't trust us now. 
 What the hell happened to you in there? 
 I am putting together a detailed analysis. 
 Of his portfolio right now. 
 If he sees those numbers, he will sign. 
 Just don't worry about it. 
 Oh, yeah. Worrying is part of the goddamn job, Neil. 
 Okay, let me tell you something. 
 No Charles, no partnership. 
 No partnership, you're gonna owe me money, chief. 
 I owe you money? 
 I make you a partner means you're vested in the company. 
 I fire you, you owe me a year's salary. 
 No, we didn't talk about that. 
 It's in your contract. 
 I never signed anything. 
 Okay, then I'll forge your signature, and I'll fight you in court to prove that it was you. 
 If that's what it takes. 
 This is how the game is played at this level, Neil. 
 I take you off the bench and put you in, I expect results. 
 You make this sh1t happen, okay, son? 
 Or you write me a check and go home. 
 You know, I gotta say, that felt really good. 
 I totally get why you did that now. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Anika. 
 I'd like to talk to whoever's in charge of my school records. 
 I've decided to take the G.E.D. to test out of school, and I need my records to do that. 
 Can I have them... please? 
 We don't just hand those over to students. 
 You're gonna have to ask your parents to come in. 
 They're my records. 
 I should be entitled to have them. 
 Actually, until you're 18, they belong to the school. 
 You don't even want me here anymore. 
 Why can't I just have them? This is such bullshit. 
 Let me go get the Dean. 
 [School rings] 
 What are you looking at, huh? 
 You think I'm some sort of freak? 
 We didn't think you were coming back. 
 Smile. 
 [Girls laughing] 
 [Girls chattering] 
 No, Stan, I need you to send me Lipton's cost report now. 
 All right, well, send me what you do have. 
 Okay, I can give you 20 minutes, tops. 
 Got it? Good. Bye. 
 If he doesn't call back in ten minutes, I want you to call him every 30 seconds until he emails it to you. 
 I programmed the address into your phone already. 
 Can I get you anything for the road? 
 A water? Coffee? 
 Um... 
 You know what you can do? 
 Start setting aside 15 minutes out of my schedule every day. 
 I'm gonna start meditating. 
 [Elevator dings] 
 Okay. 
 And call Stan. 
 [Elevator dings] 
 [Phone ringing] 
 This is Neil. 
 You know, for a family-sized car, this thing rides pretty nice. 
 Who is this? 
 All I wanted was my phone back with all my contacts, and you still had to go and call the IRS. 
 You're calling me from my car? 
 You wanna steal my life, I'm gonna steal yours. 
 And I wouldn't report it stolen either, or my next move is to go just a little more public about your moonlighting experience, Mr. newly minted partner. 
 Look, I'm not a bad guy, okay? 
 I'm just trying to make a living here. 
 Get me my car back and call off the dogs. 
 We'll call it even.

 No, I still thought it was bogus, but I actually want to go back to school now. 
 I just found out I'm really popular. 
 [Laughs] 
 So I don't understand. Someone towed your car? 
 In a manner of speaking. 
 Do you have, like, unpaid parking tickets or something? 
 Let's just say that I made a rash decision a few days ago, and things got a little out of hand. 
 Well, I'm psyched. I get to help you close Charles now.

 Thank you, Stan. 
 Hi! I'm here to see Charles. 
 He's with company right now. 
 Excuse me, sir, you can't go in there. 
 I'm sorry. He pushed right past me. 
 Actually, perfect timing. 
 I'm sorry to barge in like this. 
 Hi, honey. Don't be mad at me. 
 But after you told me how badly the meeting went the other day, I called Charles and insisted he let me come by to explain why you were having such an off day. 
 I'm very sorry for your loss. 
 Thank you. 
 He just hates to appear emotional. 
 I keep him in touch with that side of himself. 
 Right, honey? 
 So should I leave you two to finish business? 
 I appreciate you both coming by today, but it's a lot of money for someone to be in charge of, and I am just a little skittish about who I can trust. 
 Of course. 
 So I'm still gonna need to think about it. 
 She's not my wife. 
 My wife's name is Grace. 
 Adriana and I are, um, what would you call it? 
 A little more than acquaintances, I think. 
 She's not your wife? 
 You assumed that at the party, and I never corrected you. 
 Oh, and no one died. 
 If we are going to get into a long term relationship, you need to know that I will always be honest with you, even if it gets uncomfortable. 
 You serious? 
 He's serious. 
 What the hell is going on here? 
 You're cheating on your wife. 
 You're going along with it. 
 Is that really so scandalous? 
 I already know that you support four different women in this state, none of whom are Mrs. Lipton. 
 Part of my service is combing through your assets to see where your money can work better for you, so I see everything. 
 And another thing I saw was just how much your last firm was stealing from you. 
 About a million or so every month. 
 I think you've been trusting the wrong people for the wrong reasons. 
 You figured this out, huh? 
 They hid it well. 
 But I'm betting you had a gut feeling that something was going on. 
 That's why you needed someone else to take over your portfolio. 
 So, Charles, I have to ask you. 
 What's your gut feeling telling you about who you should trust now? 
 [Radio chatter] 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Car alert beeps] 
 You got my message. 
 Yeah, I-I just wanted to bring this by. 
 It's the rest of what I owe you. 
 And... I don't want to see you anymore. 
 Come inside. 
 No, no, no. 
 Grace... 
 No, I think it's better if this is over now, just... 
 The money's been paid, and we're done. 
 Grace, you know this has never been about the money for me, Grace. 
 I don't... I don't even think about this stuff when I'm with you. 
 Please.

 There's a lot of that going around today. 
 I told you your business would improve if we worked together.

 You know, that's a pretty big garage. 
 Is it full? 
 I was hoping I could keep this car here. 
 Maybe come around from time to time, use it. 
 On a trial basis. 
 You want to park your car in my garage. 
 I like the sound of that. 
 And I lost my phone recently, so I have to get a new number. 
 I'll call you when I do. 
 Thank you. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 How long was that? 
 Six minutes. 
 That's it? 
 Yeah. When you find your thoughts drifting, always return to the breath. 
 We tend to daydream about the future. 
 And dwell in the past. 
 Zen practice is about accepting and appreciating your life in this moment. 
 Right now. 
 This moment. 
 Okay. 
 [Breathing deeply] 
 [Sinister music] 
 [Whispers] Neil. 
 [Laughter] [Moaning] 
 [Whispers] Neil. 
 [Moaning] 
 Neil! 
 Neil! 
 [Gasps] 
 I think we're gonna need a lot more practice. 
 [Moaning] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Moaning continues] 
 Grace? 
 [Device beeps] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh, um, I finally found the charger, and when I went to rewind it, I found this. 
 Do you remember when we closed escrow, it was just you and I in the house. 
 Yeah. 
 [Device beeps] 
 [Moaning] 
 Wow. 
 Look at how young I look. 
 Oh, you haven't aged, Grace. 
 [Moaning continues] 
 I've put on a few pounds. 
 We look hot. 
 [Moaning continues] 
 Oh, my God! 
 I don't even want to know. 
 [Device beeps] 
 Can I borrow the car? 
 You'll have to take your mom's. 
 Mine's in the shop. 
 Cool. 
 No texting! 
 Yes! 
 Uhhuh! 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Laughing] 
 We should hide that. 
 Yeah. 
 Did you get my email? 
 About the letter she rewrote? 
 It's really good. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm proud of her. 
 How's your... How's your project going? 
 Oh, finished. You want to have a look? 
 Yeah, sure.

 [Car door opens and closes] 
 Hey, you guys. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Totally cool. You made it. 
 Yeah. You know, I pretty much get my mom's car whenever I want. 
 [Scoffs] My dad refuses to buy me one. 
 It's so stupid. 
 So you wanna do a little shopping? 
 Totally. 
 I'm hoping I'm gonna need some back-to-school clothes soon. 
 Oh! Awesome. 
 Huh. 
 What's wrong? 
 This is my dad's car. 
 It's got the school sticker in the window. 
 And the dent right here. 
 He said he dropped it off to get fixed. 
 [Car alert beeps] 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I'm gonna need to get out here, so... 
 What's your name? 
 Simon. Do I know you? 
 Nice car. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Engine starts] 
 This dude is totally busted. 
 It's... it's amazing. 
 [Phone dings] 
 Hard to get going at first, but my sister was a big help. 
 [Scoffs] Stephanie? 
 Yeah, you're never gonna believe what I did. 
 And Anika totally busted me.
