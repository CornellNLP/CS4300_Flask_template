 male announcer : Previously on "Satisfaction"... 
 I have never stopped loving you, which is why I want you to resolve this thing with your father before he dies. 
 Stage Four and it's everywhere. 
 Simon, it's Neil. I wanted to talk to you about a business proposal. 
 Starting a new business on my block, and I don't even get a phone call? 
 If we're going to play in the same sandbox, we're going to need to establish some ground rules. 
 Separation papers. I had my lawyer draw them up. 
 This is a new beginning for you, Grace and I'm so happy you're here. 
 But if Neil's signature is forged, are the papers even legal? 
 Why don't you let me worry about that? 
 You did everything you could to break us apart, but it only really proves one thing. 
 And what might that be? 
 That you have absolutely no idea what it is to really love another person.

 And, uh, looking to reinvent herself. 
 So, that's your assessment? 
 You think I need bigger breasts? 
 Uh, it's really not my job to have an opinion. 
 What I do know is there's nothing wrong with wanting to feel better about yourself. 
 Look, we have a library of brochures here. 
 Breast implants. Tummy tucks. Facial procedures.

 Well, it's a complicated situation. 
 It's none of my business. 
 Listen, Simon, you want my advice? 
 Go home and stop worrying. 
 I get this from expecting parents all the time. 
 They read something in a blog, they're up in a cold sweat, worrying about everything that could possibly go wrong. 
 Save your money. 
 The chances are incredibly slim. 
 I just thought I would be at a higher risk because of my dad. 
 I'm not sure I follow. 
 He's dying. 
 He was in the hospital last week. 
 You're talking about when he blacked out in the boxing ring. 
 He was treated for hypertension and released. 
 His scans are fine. 
 Simon, I've been your father's physician for almost 15 years. 
 If he were dying, I would know something about it. 
 [cell phone vibrating] 
 Victor. 
 Yeah. 
 I was reviewing all our holdings from last fiscal year. 
 There might be a way to spin this thing. 
 Where are you? 
 The office, where else? 
 The hospital. 
 Ah, they let me go. 
 Called it a minor cardiac event. [chuckles] 
 [sighs] 
 When are you coming in? 
 I'll get there when I get there. 
 Victor : Yeah, hurry up, pal. 
 We got a lot of work to do. 
 [phone chimes] 
 You're still here? 
 I was gonna make breakfast. 
 How's Swiss cheese and beer sound? 
 I love this house. 
 I don't want to sell this house. 
 [laughs softly] 
 Me neither. 
 But we are going to have to do something about breakfast. 
 Pick up. 
 Emma : Hello? 
 Where are you? 
 Uh, we just arrived. We're checking in. 
 Simon : Is he near you? 
 Simon, what's wrong? 
 He's not sick. 
 What? 
 Simon : He is not sick. 
 I just saw his doctor, and then I called the clinic down there. 
 He doesn't have an appointment scheduled with them. 
 He has never even contacted them. 
 Wait, I don't understand. 
 This is all bullshit, okay? 
 The will, adding me to the company. 
 He's been lying to both us this entire time. 
 Who is that? 
 Uh, it's the gym. 
 It's about my membership. 
 Huh. I wouldn't have thought your phone would work down here. 
 Come on. They want to see your passport. 
 I have to go. 
 No, no, wait. 
 You know, just being down here, I feel better already.
