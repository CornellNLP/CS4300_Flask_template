 Previously on "Satisfaction"... 
 Your husband ruined my marriage. 
 I know how you feel right now. 
 Oh, really? You know how I feel, huh? 
 Do you know where your father is? 
 Who are you? How did you get into my apartment? 
 My father's an old friend of yours. 
 How does someone like him wind up owing $50 million to an Omar Sandhal? 
 If he disappears, you inherit his debt. 
 Arthur and his wife were killed in a car accident two days ago. 
 Have you ever had a psychedelic experience? 
 Those who travel are lost. 
 Those who seek know exactly what they're looking for. 
 Where's my money? It's not in my backpack. 
 If we're going to usher in a whole new level of consciousness... 
 I said I would help out, not give it all away. 
 My dad gave me some money and I lost it. 
 $22,345... that's how much you stole from her. 
 Anika made a donation. 
 As for stealing, she took something of mine before she left. 
 Which you can have back when you return the money. 
 Should I really believe that? 
 [electric shock] 
 [yelps] 
 Went to see Julian. 
 I got your money back. 
 Are you gonna tell her that's your money? 
 Thanks for giving my money back. 
 Where is she? 
 Mom and Dad, I fell in love, I found a home, and I found an new family. 
 Ever since I can remember, I've always thought that there was more to this world than meets the eye. 
 [heart beat] 
 That there were other planes, hidden doorways to get you there, if you're willing to face your deepest fears. 
 Have you ever had a psychedelic experience? 
 Neil? 
 Anika!

 No this is for saving peoples' lives. 
 Look. 
 Welcome to the future site of the Dome Addiction Recovery Center. 
 A revolutionary approach to overcoming drug addiction through hallucinogenic experience. 
 Are you opening a clinic? 
 It's more like a doorway. 
 You know that what I make, it's... it's not a drug. 
 It's a way into your subconscious. 
 Real drugs... meth, heroin... they're about trying to escape, but psychedelics... they're about getting back to your center. 
 It's why shamans have used them for centuries. 
 I've been working on a unique delivery system. 
 How come you never said anything about this before? 
 Well, I had to get the formula right and find the right partner. 
 [exhales] 
 The drugs that you stole. 
 Where are they? 
 I was trying to help her. 
 In what world is hiding our daughter from us helping her? 
 She just needed time. She wasn't ready to see you. 
 Why the hell not? 
 I don't know, Grace! 
 Maybe she wasn't feeling up to facing your judgment. 
 Why would we be judging her? 
 There was situation with a boy. 
 His name is Julian. 
 The little punk took all her money. 
 Oh, my God. Is she okay? 
 She's fine and I managed to get it back, but I think there's more to the story. 
 There were drugs involved. 
 What kind of drugs? 
 Where is this guy? 
 Could she have gone back to him? 
 Rosalie? 
 Will you get the Trumans directions to that camp, please? 
 He's part of some ridiculous tribe of hippies living out in the woods. 
 Grace, she was confused and needed help. 
 You would have done the same thing. 
 Bullshit. 
 This is about power. It's always about power with you and this is you using our daughter as a pawn to hold something over us. 
 You know what? Fine. 
 Make up whatever story you want. 
 Innocent girl held captive by witch. 
 It's not what happened. 
 I don't believe a word you say anymore. 
 Is it really that shocking that Anika wouldn't want to return to your little house full of secrets? 
 What have you told her about us these last couple of days? 
 Oh, you mean how daddy was an escort and mommy paid someone to service her?

 It's so sad to me. 
 You can't have your own marriage or your own family, so you just keep on trying to steal mine.

 Why do you think that is, Grace?
