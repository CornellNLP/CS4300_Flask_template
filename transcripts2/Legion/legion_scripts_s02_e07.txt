 Ostensibly on Legion NARRATOR: A delusion starts like any other idea, as an egg. 
  From the shell, you'd never know anything was wrong. 
  It's what's inside that matters. 
  [GRUNTING] 
  You're still working for him. 
  - The Shadow King. 
  - Okay, I'm not not working for him. 
  How are you real? 
  [SCREAMS] 
  Whose body is that? 
  LENNY: I'm not sure Farouk found his body. 
  [GASPS] 
  I think he found mine. 
  [CRYING] : No, no, no, no. 
  [HAMMERING NAILS IN DISTANCE] 
  NARRATOR: Moral panic is defined as "public anxiety or alarm in response to a perceived threat to the moral standards of society. " The road to moral panic has several stops. 
  The first is concern. 
  [FLASH BULB CLICKS] 
  This concern, limited at first, spreads from person to person amplified by cultural forces [INDISTINCT VOICES OVER RADIO] 
  until rational concern becomes irrational fear. 
  [EXCITED CHATTER, SHOUTING] 
  People come to believe something terrible is happening. 
  Something they cannot see. 
  That they can't control. 
  It has come for others. 
  It will come for them. 
  [DISTORTED] : Witch! 
  Get her! 
  NARRATOR: Whether or not the threat is real, the response certainly is. 
  And it is often excessive. 
  [CRACKS] 
  [ROPE CREAKING] 
  Ask yourself: what's more terrifying, fear, or the frightened?

  [GROWLS] 
  [CLICKING TONGUE] 
  Use your words. 
  [GROWLING] 
  Amy. 
  Oh, please. 
  She put you in l'asile, like a crazy person. 
  I was sick. 
  You were a joke, something to laugh at with her friends. 
  David the dancing bear. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  She was trying to help me, and you killed her. 
  Did she? 
  Help? 
  Or did you wish horrible things for dear sister Amy? 
  Terrible things. 
  no secrets. 
  Those were just thoughts. 
  They were You hated her. 
  You wished her dead for calling you insane. 
  Her foot always on your back, stopping you from being who you are, what you could be. 
  And now, it's time for them to pay. 
  Who? 
  Everyone. 
  Remove your mask. 
  Show them your face. 
  You could be beautiful. 
  I'm not like you. 
  I don't hide behind masks. 
  [FAROUK LAUGHS SOFTLY] 
  [SIGHS] 
  I'm tired of the boo-hoo. 
  Do what you want. 
  Take what you want. 
  Gods make rules. 
  They don't follow them. 
  I'm done. 
  You and me, we're not friends. 
  I'm not helping you anymore. 
  I'm gonna find your body, and then I'm gonna burn it. 
  And if you're lucky, that's all I'm gonna do to it. 
  You feel me? 
  Okay. 
  It seems I was wrong. 
  You're not ready to sit with big boys. 
  Back to the kiddie table. 
  I will miss you, my friend. 
  But I'm sure we will see each other again, when I'm back in my body. 
  My temple. 
  On your mark, get set [SPEAKS GERMAN] 
  go. 
  [GLASS RINGING] 
  [SPEAKING FRENCH] 
  DAVID: Amy. 
  Amy. 
  It's not true. 
  What he said. 
  I didn't want this. 
  I didn't [CRYING] : I'm sorry. 
  [FAROUK'S VOICE LAUGHING] 
  [SILVERWARE CLATTERING] 
  DAVID: Don't laugh at me. 
  Stop it. 
  Stop it! 
  Now! 
  [LAUGHING STOPS] 
  DAVID 1: Stop it. 
  We can't torture him. 
  DAVID 2: Why not? 
  DAVID 1: Because first, it's horrible, and second, he's just a mind. 
  Does he even feel pain? 
  SYD: Do you want to talk about it? 
  Huh? 
  Amy? 
  No. 
  He wants you distracted, emotional. 
  Farouk. 
  I know. 
  You can't let him. 
  I know. 
  [EXHALES] 
  What does she say about it? 
  Me, in the future. 
  I don't know, we haven't talked about it. 
  Maybe you should. 
  Talk to her. 
  If you're not gonna talk to me. 
  That wouldn't bother you? 
  What? 
  If you talk to me? 
  In the future? 
  Why? 
  Oh, no reason. 
  Just Well, I wouldn't want you to be jealous. 
  Of myself? 
  Why would I David, why would I be jealous of myself? 
  No, no reason. 
  It's I-It's weird, okay? 
  Y-You're you and she's also you, and I'm not It's not like there's a handbook. 
  Are you physical with her? 
  No. 
  David? 
  See? 
  You are jealous. 
  I'm not. 
  I just You're right, it's weird. 
  So let's why don't we make some ground rules? 
  Okay. 
  You can talk to her. 
  And if she needs a hug or something I know it doesn't make sense, but It's-it's how you feel. 
  Hey. 
  I love you. 
  Are you gonna say it, too? 
  [WHISPERS] : Shut up. 
  I love you. 
  [LIQUID BURBLING] 
  [CRACKLING] 
  [CRACKLING] 
  [WHOOSHING] 
  David? 
  [LOW CRACKLE] 
  [LOW CRACKLE] 
  - How - You think he is the only one who can outsmart the universe? 
  Our David? 
  [DISTORTED] : He told you. 
  He he won't help. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You think I need his help? 
  He kills you. 
  In my timeline, the race ends and you lose. 
  So, yes I think you need him. 
  Do you play craps? 
  Roll the bones? 
  Dice. 
  A game of chance. 
  ProbabilitÃ©. 
  But it can be rigged. 
  You mean you can cheat? 
  Escheat. 
  That's a legal term Which means: under the law, the property of an individual reverts to the state if the individual dies without an heir. 
  I don't understand. 
  All I'm saying is who writes the law? 
  The state. 
  So you see the game is rigged. 
  And, baby I am the state. 
  So even when I lose I win. 
  [LOW CRACKLE] 
  You can't hurt me here. 
  You know that, right? 
  Are you sure? 
  But no, mon amour. 
  Why would I hurt you? 
  We are allies. 
  We both want the same thing For me to live. 
  Now, I know why this is what I want. 
  The question is: why is this what you want? 
  We need you. 
  We? 
  I need you. 
  To stop the world from ending. 
  And who will end the world? 
  Tiny humans with their bombs? 
  Or World War III? 
  No. 
  No. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Stop it. 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  For centuries everyone said, "Amahl Farouk is the villain. 
  " Year after year, they came the heroes with their blue eyes and their white skin to kill me. 
  They thought by killing me they will save the world. 
  And now you're telling me that the opposite is true. 
  That the villain is the hero and the hero is the villain? 
  [FAROUK CHUCKLES] 
  Oxymoron. 
  Maybe we're all vill-villains. 
  All? 
  If you're the Earth, the birds peace. 
  "When two tribes go to war a point is all you can score. 
  " Frankie Goes to Hollywood. 
  If David doesn't help me you will. 
  And together, we'll rule the world. 
  Save the world. 
  From him.

  Isn't it weird that we were both inside David? 
  Mentally, I mean. 
  I know what you're doing. 
  What? 
  Shaving my armpits? 
  You're not Lenny. 
  And you're not Amy. 
  You're the song they play outside a hostage crisis to keep criminals from thinking clearly. 
  [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
  I hear what you're saying. 
  And I agree We're gonna be best friends. 
  It's not gonna work. 
  None of your crazy sh1t. 
  Whatever Farouk told you to do your secret plan it's just noise. 
  He raped me. 
  Farouk. 
  Over and over again. 
  Kept me in the basement of his mind. 
  Like one of those Amish girls snatched from the side of the road. 
  But you know, whatever. 
  Um, bros before hos, right?

  Hey! 
  [SCREECHING] 
  You made my friends sick. 
  Yeah, hey. 
  Hi, hi. 
  Can you understand me? 
  You picked a really shitty time to attack us. 
  I'm not saying it's your fault. 
  I mean, it is, but the timing, it's-it's not good. 
  I'm dealing with a lot here. 
  With the Shadow King. 
  And, well, this this isn't helping. 
  So [ROARS] 
  I was hoping you could appreciate my situation and maybe, I don't know, be on your way. 
  Go back to where you came fro Otherwise, I have to kill you.

  [SCREECHING] 
  [SIGHS] 
  NARRATOR: So what have we learned? 
  That a delusion is an idea. 
  That an idea can be contagious. 
  That human beings are pattern-seeking animals. 
  By which, I mean we prefer ideas that fit a pattern. 
  In other words, we don't believe what we see. 
  We see what we believe. 
  And when we are stressed or our beliefs are challenged When we feel threatened The ideas we have can become irrational, one delusion leading to another, and another, as the human mind struggles to maintain its identity. 
  And when this occurs, what starts as an egg can become a monster. 
  [FAN BLADES WHIRRING] 
  - Shh.
