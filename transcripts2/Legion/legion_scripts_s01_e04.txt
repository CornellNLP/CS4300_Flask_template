 Good evening.   
 We are here tonight to talk about violence.   
 Or maybe human nature.   
 [sighs]   
 We are here to talk about human nature.   
 Wait.   
 A quote.   
 A great philosopher once wrote, "In times of peace, the warlike man attacks himself."    
 This is the root of all our problems.    
 And by "this," I mean "we."    
 We are the root of all our problems... our confusion, our anger, our fear of things we don't understand.    
 Violence, in other words, is ignorance.    
 Figure your sh1t out.    
 That's my... what I'd say.

 There are two kinds of stories we tell our children.    
 The first kind:    
 Once upon a time, there was a fuzzy little rabbit named Frizzy-Top who went on a quantum, fun adventure only to face a big setback, which he overcame through perseverance and by being adorable.    
 This kind of story teaches empathy.    
 Put yourself in Frizzy-Top's shoes, in other words.    
 The other kind: Oliver Anthony Bird, if you get too close to that ocean, you'll be sucked into the sea and drowned!    
 This kind of story teaches them fear.    
 And for the rest of their lives, these two stories compete.    
 Empathy and fear.    
 And so I bring you tonight's play, a work in five acts about a fuzzy little bunny who got too close to the ocean and what happened next.    
 Let us begin.

 He's not inside his memories, his subconscious.   
 I looked.   
 Wherever his mind is, I can't find it.     
 - But he's not... 
- He's not brain-dead, no.     
 His mind is active.     
 What's it doing, though?     
 You know he can create a kind of mental projection space,  something between reality and dream.     
 An astral plane.     
 [dramatic musical flourish]   
 Could we have been inside David's memory three times?   
 Three times, we saw glitches, omissions.     
 It's as if we've activated some kind of guardian.     
 There's something in David's memory he does not want us to see.     
 - Kerry. 
- Yes.     
 I have a mission for you.     
 In fact, the three of you.     
 I'm sending you out.     
 We need to find out exactly what happened to David   
 before he went to Clockworks.   
 What about Division Three?   
 That's just a risk we'll have to take.   
 -  He's too important. 
-  Is he, though?   
 'Cause I'm thinking "dangerous" is a better word.     
 Look, I think he's annoying,

 We can't stay long.     
 Just a guess, but I'd say Dr. Poole hasn't been here in a few years.     
 It's weird,  seeing it after visiting David's memory.   
 The curtains are completely different.     
 Most people's memories are unreliable... the things we see, that people say.     
 And they change over time too.     
 Your past is an illusion.     
 There was a tear right there.     
 The wall opened up, and a red light came out.

 I looked for you.     
 You weren't in any memories of David I could find.     
 Are you saying David created that space?     
 It's part of his ability: psychic projection to create a simulated reality.

 Trust me.     
 Well, you try hearing voices for   ,    years, self-medicate with hard drugs, and then get dumped in a loony bin.     
 I was in a loony bin.     
 Yeah, but you're...
