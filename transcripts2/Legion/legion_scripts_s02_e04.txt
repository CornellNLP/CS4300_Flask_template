  JOAN: "Afterward, some are strong at the broken places. 
  The word "survivor" used to mean "one who has survived," but now modern psychiatry would have us believe that survival is a curse, like Sisyphus with his rock. 
  And so every day we wake - to survive again.

  ["TURTLENECK" BY THE NATIONAL PLAYING] 
  Oh, my mother Let your daughter dance with me I'd like to spin her wild around the cottonwood tree There's something about her eyes I think her roots are rotten This must be the reason She wears her hair up in knots, oh, no This is so embarrassing Ah, we're pissing fits Crying on our doorsteps in T-shirts loose and ripped Some of them so out of style I cannot save them They'll just get whatever my salvation gave them Keep the weed next to the bed Light the water, check for lead Dim the lights a little lower Hide your backbone, shrug your shoulders Give the gift that fits your head You have to get this turtleneck. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PA] 
  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
  DAVID: So, this is your core desire? 
  What? 
  This place, the museum. 
  Do I know you? 
  Syd, it's me. 
  Me who? 
  You know what? 
  Just forget it. 
  Get lost. 
  I'll scream, creep. 
  - I'm just sitting. 
  - You got your warning. 
  Loud and clear. 
  You like this painting? 
  You don't? 
  Well, it's It's what? 
  No. 
  Forget it. 
  Um Well, I mean, it's the He's trapped in all that negative space. 
  No feet. 
  No hands. 
  Mouth covered. 
  No way to communicate or connect. 
  It's, um Honest. 
  That's not the word I was thinking, but yeah, I guess it's that, too. 
  Before, what did you mean? 
  Before when? 
  You said my "core desire. 
  " The thing you want most in the world. 
  I see you here a lot, you know. 
  Sitting, looking. 
  So I figure this must be your place. 
  Somewhere you can be a part of the world without needing to touch it. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You don't know anything. 
  You think ghosts like living in a haunted house?

  SYD: "All of us strode up and down Eighth Street like it was an actual artery in some larger life-form, in some larger organism. 
  None of us seemed to know the nature of the coincidences that bound us together, as I know now. " [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [BELL BLARES] 
  Oops.

  Born to Joan Barrett. 
  Can't be touched without changing places. 
  Favorite stuffed toy is a walrus named Whiskers. 
  Don't be afraid. 
  I'm a friend. 
  You're in the maze, caught in a loop of your own life. 
  Trapped. 
  Everybody is. 
  Was. 
  Except their mazes were simpler. 
  Ptonomy wanted to forget. 
  Melanie wanted to be untouchable. 
  I just had to figure out what they wanted and then I could talk to them and set them free. 
  But you It took me a while, but I figured it out. 
  Like I said, it's the couple. 
  The way they are together. 
  How close. 
  You saw them when you were a girl, and now you come back here every week, looking for what they had. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Wrong. 
  Watch it again. 
  Get a room.

  ["WHITE ROOM" PLAYING] 
  [BABY CRYING] 
  [CRYING] 
  In the white room With black curtains Near the station Black roof country No gold pavements Tired starlings Silver horses Ran down moonbeams In your dark eyes [SNIFFS, GRUNTS] 
  Dawnlight smiles On you leaving My contentment CHEERLEADERS: Go, fight, win! 
  - I'll wait - It was him. 
  - He just started hitting them. 
  - In this place Where the sun Never shines Wrong. 
  Wait in this place Where the shadows Run From themselves You said no strings Could secure you At the station JOAN: "afterward, some are strong at the broken places. 
  " Platform ticket Restless diesels Good-bye windows I walked into Such a sad time At the station [JOAN READING INDISTINCTLY] 
  As I walked out Felt my own need Just beginning. 
  GIRLS: Lives with her mom 'cause her dad's in hell. 
  Poor lost elf. 
  Keeps to herself. 
  Lives with her mom 'cause her dad's in hell. 
  Hey. 
  Piss off! 
  [SCREAMING] 
  Hi, I'm David. 
  I'm a I'm a teacher here. 
  Were those girls bothering you? 
  You're cheating. 
  What? 
  You can't just ask me. 
  The whole point is you have to figure it out yourself. 
  Wait. 
  What is happening? 
  I thought we were in the maze. 
  The monk Again. 
  [GASPS] 
  Cary? 
  Cary. 
  Cary. 
  CARY [MUFFLED] 
  : Oh. 
  I'm stuck. 
  I'm in here. 
  - I-I'm You got to pull. 
  - [GRUNTS] 
  Pull, pull, pull, pull. 
  - Pull. 
  - [GRUNTS] 
  - [PANTS] 
  - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
  Oh, excuse me. 
  Hi. 
  Hi! 
  Excuse me! 
  We Hello. 
  We j We just woke up. 
  Yeah. 
  You and everybody else. 
  They, uh, found the monk on the sidewalk, dead. 
  And then all the missing woke up 300 angry people who all need to use the bathroom at the same time. 
  It looks like he went off the roof, the monk. 
  Which could mean that he caused the plague, infected people wherever he went, - and now that he's gone, the - KERRY: Off the roof. 
  How did he That's unclear. 
  I got to, uh - Well, w-whoa. 
  What about David? 
  - And Syd? 
  I don't understand. 
  Why haven't they woken up like the others? 
  No. 
  No. 
  What? 
  Can't be right. 
  Use words. 
  They are awake. 
  What? 
  Their brain waves have changed. 
  It's not the same pattern we got with the others with the plague. 
  As far as I can tell, they're both awake. 
  So why aren't their eyes open? 
  [KEYBOARD CLICKING] 
  I don't know. 
  [WIND WHISTLING] 
 
 
 
  Okay. 
  I get it. 
  - You do? 
  - Yes. 
  It took me a while 'cause I'm thick, but I finally figured it out, figured you out, why you're doing this. 
  - Me? 
  - Yes, you. 
  It's not a maze. 
  It's not the maze. 
  I-I thought it was, but this is you. 
  You think that if you show me who you are, who you really are All the mistakes, all the fouled up things you did That I won't love you anymore. 
  It's a test. 
  But you're forgetting who I am. 
  David the-the lunatic, the drug addict, who stole and cheated and ruined everything. 
  And, yeah, you made some bad choices, but you were young. 
  And the world is an ugly place for people like us To people like us, so I love you, okay? 
  And there is nothing you can show me that is gonna scare me away. 
  So, ca Can we go home now? 
  [SIGHS] 
  [IMITATES BUZZER SOUND] 
  Try again. 
  Try. 
  No. 
  Really? 
  [JOAN GRUNTS] 
  [BABY CRYING] 
  I won't give up. 
  I'll never give up.

  Oh, my God. 
  - [SOBBING] 
  JOAN [ECHOING] : Oh! 
  Okay. 
  Okay. 
  I think I understand. 
  It's not about being alone, or about being in love. 
  It's about the things you survived. 
  And as it's written, "The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places. " - Go on. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  It's not the story of a little girl whose mommy couldn't hug her who grew up wishing a prince's kiss could erase all her damage. 
  It's about the damage itself, and how it makes us strong, not weak. 
  You survived the bullies and the way they made you feel. 
  You cut yourself with the dullest blade 'cause it felt the worst I know that life, - 'cause I lived it, too. 
  - I know. 
  And then I met you, and it was true love. 
  Like in a fairy tale. 
  This isn't a fairy tale. 
  [DAVID CHUCKLES] 
  It is for me. 
  Do you know what love is? 
  It's a hot bath. 
  What happens to things when you leave them in a bath for too long? 
  Huh? 
  They get soft. 
  Fall apart. 
  [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  I read that story collection. 
  The one in your book. 
  At first, I was confused, you know Why is she carrying around this sordid tale of s*x clubs and drug addicts and And then I read this "Junkies and masochists and hookers, and those who have squandered everything are the ring of brightest angels around heaven. 
  " It's a war baby, this life. 
  The things we endure. 
  You said you saw the future, and it's an apocalypse. 
  Who survives that the lovers or the fighters? 
  They sell us this lie that love's gonna save us. 
  All it does is make us stupid and weak. 
  - [SCOFFS] 
  Thanks. 
  - Look at me. 
  Love isn't gonna save us. 
  It's what we have to save. 
  Pain makes us strong enough to do it. 
  All our scars, our anger, our despair It's armor. 
  Baby, God loves the sinners best 'cause our fire burns bright, bright, bright. 
  Burn with me.
