  I'm everything you wanna be.

  [sighs] 
  He got the bullet out. 
  Stopped the bleeding. 
  Do you have a minute? 
  'Cause well, yesterday we did some digging into your past what's real, and I think we may know I know what I am. 
  You do? 
  - I'm the magic man.

  - [exhales] 
  - It's okay. 
  I just wanted you to know I found a way for us to be together. 
  [waves crashing] 
  [birds cawing] 
  I don't understand. 
  It's all an illusion. 
  [chuckles] 
  I see that now. 
  Why'd I fight so hard? 
  Where are we? 
  It's just a room by a beach. 
  I made it. 
  They're signals, that's all. 
  What you see, what you hear. 
  Impulses sent from nerve endings. 
  Electricity in the brain. 
  Real, fake. 
  It's all the same. 
  You know, they say the brain is the largest erogenous zone. 
  How did how did you We're not really touching. 
  You're so beautiful. 
  [dramatic music] 
  [machines thrumming] 
  [breathing shakily] 
  [machine beeps] 
  How is she? 
  The swelling is down, but she's not responsive. 
  Can't you just absorb her? 
  Fix her that way? 
  I'd go into shock. 
  It's a very delicate ecosystem. 
  He saw him, Cary. 
  Oliver. 
  In the Astral Plane. 
  He told you? 
  He can bring him back. 
  I know it. 
  Class starts in 5 minutes. 
  I know where they're holding Amy. 
  I'll be going to get her in the morning. 
  David, we talked about this. 
  I'm not asking you to go. 
  Well, I'm going. 
  These things take time. 
  To scope. 
  To observe. 
  Who? 
  How many? 
  Defenses? 
  Not just military. 
  They have their own special help. 
  People like you. 
  Sydney, you saw this with Walter. 
  [whispers inaudibly] 
  I'll be fine. 
  Maybe if we surprise them. 
  But, no. 
  They know. 
  You can't help her. 
  Not yet. 
  Aren't you gonna ask about him? 
  The diver? 
  How does he look? 
  He looks good. 
  Strong. 
  He lives in an ice cube. 
  I don't understand. 
  How long has he been in there? 
  The astral whatever? 
  In February, it'll be 21 years. 
  You know, David In the beginning, he was just like you. 
  Same kind of power. 
  Psychic. 
  Then he found a place where he could rule. 
  Be the creator. 
  Then he started spending more and more time there. 
  [dramatic music] 
  Sometimes I'd just find him sitting someplace just staring into space. 
  And then one day he just didn't wake up. 
  Did he ask about me? 
  He remembers very little, I think. 
  Facts. 
  He makes his own reality now. 
  But there was a moment. 
  Can you Can I see him? 
  You want me to take you there? 
  No. 
  I just want you to bring him home. 
  [machine beeps] 
  [machines thrumming and whirring] 
  [whimpering] 
  [inhales sharply] 
  Hi. 
  Miss me? 
  [laughs softly] 
  Yes. 
  Are you ready? 
  [whispers] 
  Yeah. 
  [deep rumble] 
  It's okay. 
  I got you. 
  Elevator going up. 
  Mind the doors. 
  Assending. 
  Are we really going to D3 tomorrow? 
  It'll be fun. 
  Kick some ass. 
  Save the girl. 
  Get a snack. 
  They'll kill us. 
  You know that, right? 
  They'll try. 
  Can we go back? 
  [elevator chiming] 
  [screaming] 
  [both breathing heavily] 
  Was that your first time? 
  No. 
  My first time was he was one of my mother's boyfriends. 
  Your I was 16. 
  He was a journalist. 
  We had a flirtation and I was curious. 
  One night, they had too much to drink. 
  My mom passed out on the couch. 
  I heard him in the bathroom taking a shower, so I touched her hand, and then I was her. 
  We went into the bathroom. 
  But the switch didn't last long then, and when he was inside me, I changed back. 
  And then my mom was there, and everybody was screaming. 
  Who teaches us to be normal when we're one of a kind? 
  Just promise me, if you get lost, we get lost together. 
  [soft dramatic music] 
  [rhythmic thumping] 
  [dramatic music] 
  What about strength in numbers? 
  I mean, we can bring 'em as cannon fodder, but they're just gonna slow us down. 
  [chuckles] 
  It's about Amy, right? 
  Saving Amy? 
  Come on, forget these losers. 
  You saw what happened when we worked together. 
  Our muscle. 
  These D3 patsies aren't gonna know what hit 'em, but we have to go now and we have to move fast. 
  Just promise me we'll come back here when we have her. 
  Mon frÃ¨re, I love it here. 
  All these shinny happy people. 
  David? 
  Time to go. 
  - [rain pattering] 
  - [birds tweeting] 
  It's a facility in the woods, so we have to go in on the ground. 
  By which I mean, we definitely should not go in on the ground. 
  That'd be dumb. 
  He's gone. 
  [rumbling] 
  - Who? 
  - David. 
  He I heard voices, looked for him everywhere. 
  He's not here. 
  Think he went to D3. 
  sh1t. 
  Wake everyone. 
  We're going? 
  To Division Three? 
  Now? 
  No plan. 
  No intel. 
  Just chickens with our heads cut o - He needs us. 
  - Then why'd he leave? 
  The sense I get with that guy is, he's only ever thinking about numero uno. 
  So no, thank you. 
  They have his sister. 
  [sighs] 
  You don't think I have a sister? 
  Or a girlfriend? 
  Or a mom? 
  This is war. 
  We're fighting a war. 
  It's bigger than some guy named David and his sister. 
  We can't lose him. 
  Why? 
  'Cause you think he's going to bring Oliver back? 
  No because he's too powerful. 
  If they turn him [door opens, slams] 
  [commotion outside] 
  Sydney, were you with him before? 
  How did he seem? 
  David? 
  He's Something's changed. 
  He, uh Found a way for us to be together. 
  A place. 
  Did you tell him what you found out there? 
  Philly? 
  Dr. 
  Poole? 
  No. 
  We did other things. 
  Sydney I think we need to work together here. 
  David's treatment is not Lady I'm not treating him. 
  He's my man. 
  Which means, I care about what he wants. 
  What we want. 
  I could give a sh1t about how he fits in here. 
  I'm just saying be careful. 
  - David's very fragile. 
  - He doesn't seem fragile. 
  Not since he came back. 
  I know. 
  And that worries me. 
  [Radiohead's "The Daily Mail"] 
  [frog croaks] 
  The Moonies are up on a mountain The lunatics have taken over The asylum Waiting on the rapture Singing we're here To keep your prices down [car engine turns over]

  [muffled whistling] 
  [thrumming] 
  [whistling] 
  Hello. 
  Sydney. 
  Oh, thank God. 
  You have to please just open the door. 
  Where's David? 
  He was here. 
  His sister was in the next cell. 
  I told him before, not now but they took her. 
  But that's what they do. 
  They come, they take us away. 
  Questions. 
  Always the same questions. 
  [chuckles] 
  He said he was gonna let me out, but he didn't. 
  [chuckles softly] 
  Could you? 
  Please? 
  Where do you they take you when they come? 
  [chuckles] 
  The light. 
  The room with the big light. 
  There's a switch. 
  The door opens on its own. 
  [soft dramatic music] 
  Please, Sydney. 
  [chuckles] 
  Let me out of here. 
  Bitch. 
  [dramatic music] 
  [keyboard keys clacking] 
  [machine thumps, whirring] 
  - Anything? 
  - No. 
  But they record everything, so [machine beeps] 
  Miss Bird? 
  I see it. 
  I just heard my sister. 
  That wasn't a memory. 
  - Hey, don't move. 
  I got - What Don't move. 
  I'll be right back. 
  Yes, I checked that. 
  [door closes] 
  No, I-I can't stay still. 
  I'm working. 
  Did you did you leave? 
  Well, I know. 
  I it hurts me too. 
  Hello? 
  Did you have to let him kick you in the crotch so many times? 
  [children's laughter, thumping] 
  [David breathing shakily] 
  Maybe you should just, uh watch my back. 
  [breathing erratically] 
  Come on. 
  Okay. 
  I'm done with this sh1t. 
  [quietly] 
  All right. 
  [creepy, distorted laughter] 
  [dramatic music] 
  [children's laughter] 
  [electricity buzzing] 
  [rasps, gurgles] 
  [door bangs] 
  We were wrong. 
  We had it all wrong. 
  Where's David? 
  He took her. 
  His sister. 
  We knew he'd come. 
  We were [gasping] 
  Ready. 
  We thought we were ready. 
  What happened? 
  So much power. 
  It wears a human face. 
  What? 
  Be careful. 
  It It wears [whispering] 
  A human Face. 
  [gurgling] 
  - Syd. 
  - [door opens] 
  [door bangs] 
 
 
 
  I don't understand. 
  [watch beeps] 
  Miss Bird? 
  Hello, Miss Bird? 
  Cary? 
  [transmission echoing] 
  What what did you find? 
  It's complicated. 
  [echoing continues] 
  David was here. 
  He took Amy. 
  Everyone is dead. 
  - I think we were wrong. 
  - No. 
  The whole approach. 
  Treating him like the others. 
  He is schizophrenic. 
  This is not mental illness. 
  I mean split mind. 
  This monster isn't David. 
  It's a parasite of some kind. 
  You see? 
  Another consciousness inside of him. 
  What does that mean? 
  This thing burrowed into David's brain when he was a boy, maybe even a baby, and it has been there, feeding on him, ever since. 
  - The memories. 
  - The memories exactly! 
  Every time David sees this thing, or or realizes it's there this creature makes him forget. 
  It rewrites his memory. 
  Is that why we couldn't see it? 
  I think so, and I think it made you forget as well. 
  I mean, the the power of this thing. 
  You're saying it has power, not David? 
  No, no. 
  David is a very, very powerful mutant. 
  He has to be, otherwise this thing would split him apart. 
  You're you're calling this thing "It," but what else could it be if not another mutant? 
  An older mutant. 
  Its consciousness separated from its body, you see? 
  And living inside David for 30 years. 
  [banjo plucking softly] 
  Sydney. 
  David? 
  [exhales sharply] 
  Thank God. 
  We were just are you okay? 
  [plucking "Rainbow Connection"] 
  Why are there so many Songs about rainbows And what's on the other side? 
  Rainbows are visions but only illusions Rainbows have nothing to hide So we've been told and some choose to believe it I know they're wrong Wait and see Someday we'll find it The rainbow connection The lovers The dreamers and me Not like this. 
  It knows. 
  King [dog barks] 
  Come on, boy. 
  What is it? 
  He's home. 
  He went home. 
  David. 
  Summerland? 
  No. 
  Where it started. 
  We should go. 
  There may be reinforcements on the way. 
  [soft dramatic music] 
  [suspenseful music] 
  - [crickets chirping] 
  - [animals sounding] 
  [door opens] 
  [laughs softly] 
  [both laugh] 
  Everything seems so small now. 
  [soft piano music] 
  I can't believe you what you did to to save me. 
  I didn't know. 
  You knew. 
  I was scared. 
  Well, you don't have to be scared anymore. 
  Are you did we come here for a reason? 
  The old house. 
  Don't you have a they made it sound like you were part of a team with, like, a-a headquarters. 
  They'll be here soon. 
  I thought we could Talk first. 
  [quietly] 
  Okay. 
  Yeah, um What do you wanna talk about? 
  I wanna know your secret. 
  - What do you - I can smell it. 
  See? 
  The secret. 
  [eerie dramatic music] 
  Probably always, but now it's really clear. 
  You know something about me. 
  David. 
  Wha [crying softly] 
  [dramatic music] 
  Hi. 
  Look at you. 
  She's actually got kind of a hot bod under all that tight ass house frau bullshit. 
  [sniffles] 
  [quietly] 
  Who are you? 
  I'm David. 
  Oh, wait, I'm Benny. 
  [laughs] 
  You mean I'm Lenny. 
  Or is it King? 
  [mimics dog bark] 
  Oh, or, or is it my favorite [murmuring] 
  No, no, no - - [throat slitting] 
  - [crying softly] 
  - [murmuring continues] 
  No, no, no You have a secret. 
  [crying] 
  No, stop stop. 
  Please. 
  My whole life is a lie. 
  I just need to know. 
  Who am I? 
  You you were adopted. 
  [chuckles softly] 
  Who I don't know. 
  I was young. 
  [soft dramatic music] 
  Mom and dad, they they were going they were gonna tell you But then they and I just and you were ju you were so upset all the time. 
  - The illness - I don't have an illness. 
  I know. 
  I know. 
  Now. 
  I don't I don't know, I-I just thought if I told you, it would it would make things worse. 
  Exactly. 
  This will may isolate the entity, paralyze it, letting us talk to David privately. 
  Well, I don't think it's a very good idea either, but they we don't have any choice. 
  You will just have to maybe there won't even be a fight. 
  [dramatic music] 
  Don't kid yourself, old man. 
  There's always a fight. 
  [crickets chirping] 
  - [car engine idling, shuts off] 
  - [car door opens] 
  [soft dramatic music] 
  [car door closes] 
  Wait. 
  Be careful. 
  There's a chance we've left the real world and that we're in David's world now. 
  And that's bad why? 
  Well, that would make him God and he's crazy, so Stop it. 
  He's not crazy. 
  This is much, much wo [static crackles] 
  [no sound] 
  [silence continues] 
  [dramatic music] 
  [silence resumes] 
  [soft suspenseful music] 
  [static crackles] 
  [silence resumes] 
  [dramatic musical flourish] 
  [silence resumes] 
  [suspenseful music] 
  [silence resumes] 
  - [distorted]

  This is the listening place. 
  [grunts] 
  [eerie suspenseful music] 
  [normal voice] 
  Such a pretty boy. 
  And then you people [demonic echo] 
  Starting putting all these ideas in his head.
