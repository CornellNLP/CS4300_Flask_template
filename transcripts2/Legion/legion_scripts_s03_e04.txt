  Sounds boring. 
  I miss Cary. 
  Do you do that? 
  You miss people? 
  Currently tabulating the Taiwanese stock market, tending to lunar agriculture colonies and landing seven jumbo jets. 
  Everyone is so different. 
  I don't like it. 
  It's like we're all grown-ups. 
  Forget it. 
  I guess I just miss him. 
  Or me. 
  Us.

  And when girls get together, they make a girl. 
  Science. 
  God, you are so smart. 
  - You make me smart. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  What do you think we should name her? 
  Another fish name? 
  - A fish what? 
  - You know, like "Salmon. 
  " [LAUGHS] 
  No, silly. 
  Salmon's not a fish. 
  It's a color. 
  - Hmm. 
  - Maybe we call her Violet. 
  Or Violence. 
  Violence Lollipop Busker. 
  - It's got a ring to it. 
  - [LAUGHS]

  Time code, code. 
  Time code. 
  VERMILLION 1: And in space. 
  The orbiter and distant probes. 
  PTONOMY: The problem is universal. 
  Say more about that. 
  We think of time as a unified field. 
  Gravity affects it. 
  But nothing else. 
  But something is changing time. 
  Individualized time. 
  Localized time. 
  This. 
  Cool.

  Hello, my Snoopys. 
  My Sigmunds. 
  My Howdy Doodys. 
  ACOLYTES: Hi, Daddy. 
  Are you happy? 
  I hope you're happy. 
  ELOISE: Happy, Daddy. 
  - So happy.

  A bad day. 
  He made a big mess. 
  Are you mad at Daddy? 
  - ACOLYTES: Hell no! 
  - LENNY: No, Daddy. 
  We're not mad. 
  But we got a little bit of a problem here with the clock. 
  And I got a family to protect. 
  DAVID: We've all got family. 
  We are family. 
  Now that we're calm, tell me, what happened back there? 
  Why did time loop like that? 
  In the Hall of Time there are demons. 
  Wait, demons? 
  SWITCH: I call them demons. 
  EmÃ³. 
  But maybe they're just the animals of time. 
  Predators. 
  Okay. 
  In the future, if there are time demons, tell me about the time demons. 
  Sorry. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Tell me about the demons. 
  They live in the space outside of time, but they are always trying to find a way in. 
  I can hear them when I'm traveling. 
  They giggle. 
  What do they look like? 
  I don't know. 
  Like cats maybe. 
  Blue cats. 
  But instead of playing with mice, they play with time. 
  And they eat it. 
  [ACOLYTES MURMURING] 
  Hey, tranquillo, my beauties. 
  Do you think Daddy won't protect you? 
  That's what a daddy does. 
  ACOLYTES: We love you, Daddy. 
  - But we're scared. 
  - ELOISE: Yeah, we're scared. 
  Make us feel good. 
  ACOLYTES: Please!

  Dude, enough with the ego-jerk. 
  Okay? 
  We all wanna sleep with you. 
  So stop with the boo-hoo and give me a plan. 
  Careful. 
  Right, 'cause that's my specialty. 
  DAVID: Just use a different tone, okay? 
  Be nice. 
  I need you to be nice, or I can't be nice. 
  LENNY: sh1t. 
  I don't want you to be nice. 
  I want you to get mad. 
  Yeah, I want you to use your almighty powers to save our asses, okay? 
  So chop-chop, mama's boy. 
  Get to work. 
  Well, all right. 
  Look at us talking. 
  Working things out. 
  You want honest? 
  Here's honest. 
  I'm gonna fix this. 
  Whatever it takes. 
  Whatever the universe throws at me. 
  Division 3, time demons. 
  Send them all. 
  I'll slay 'em all. 
  'Cause this is my time. 
  This is David's time. 
  And he's got things to do, so Switch? 
  Switch. 
  How are you? 
  Are you okay? 
  I lost another tooth. 
  When we were in there. 
  Yeah, it really takes its toll, huh? 
  Here's the thing. 
  I'm gonna need you to take me back. 
  - Not far. 
  - I don't I don't think I can do another You're not gonna lose any more teeth, okay? 
  I can feel them all loosening. 
  Just show me where these things are so that I can And the more we go back, the more doors we open, the more agitated they'll become. 
  They'll swarm out, like wasps, and pretty soon - everything - Do I have to force you to [DISTORTED GIGGLING]

  I said I am the alpha and the omega. 
  I eat monsters for breakfast.

  FAROUK: I've heard of this beast. 
  Time Eaters, who live in gravity wells. 
  Black holes. 
  The laws of time don't apply to them. 
  They live in black holes? 
  - Uh, I mean - Yes. 
  Think of time as the wood in the house, and they are like termites living underground. 
  - David must have let them out. 
  - How do we fight them? 
  We can't. 
  Not here. 
  They're too powerful. 
  We have to go to where they sleep and kill them there: the nest. 
  CLARK: Well, where do we go, and how do we get there? 
  FAROUK: To the Time Between Time. 
  There's a rift in the astral plane.

  Sixteen. 
  You still dating Tommy Vitore? 
  Or is it the Halsey brothers? 
  How do you know that? 
  I'm you. 
  In the future. 
  Hi. 
  You're me in the future? 
  In a zeppelin. 
  It's an airship. 
  Remember our first drink? 
  Whiskey? 
  From that leftover glass at the salon? 
  Nine years old and everything got swimmy? 
  No, just one you're a minor. 
  Am I dreaming? 
  If you're lucky.

  Like staying brunette? 
  Very funny. 
  You know, last year, I was Syd in the past. 
  But I never got to meet her. 
  Me. 
  If I did, I would have asked her the same question that you want to ask me. 
  What question? 
  Who teaches you to be normal when you're one of a kind? 
  What am I? 
  People get too close. 
  They touch you and you disappear. 
  And then they're inside. 
  In your belly and in your head. 
  And when you get back, there's a smell. 
  Someone else's smell is inside your nose. 
  And you check out. 
  You tell people, "It's fine. 
  I don't own my body. 
  " You say, "My power is like a vacation. 
  I get to be a tourist in someone else's life. 
  " Who cares if every time I come back home, I feel dirty? 
  I just want to be left alone. 
  I know. 
  People die of loneliness, too. 
  They drink too much. 
  Slit their own throats. 
  I went to the shower. 
  Mom was asleep on the couch, and I went to the shower. 
  You were curious. 
  I just wanted to feel something. 
  And he turned me around. 
  Why did he turn me around? 
  Power. 
  I thought s*x was about love. 
  It can be. 
  That was it. 
  The first time. 
  My only time. 
  People talk about s*x, and all I think about is having my face pushed into wet glass. 
  How is that romantic? 
  Does it get better? 
  You fall in love. 
  [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
  And that's worth it. 
  To feel that feeling. 
  Do we get married? 
  It's complicated. 
  I'm not a kid. 
  [SIGHS] : Uh He has powers. 
  But he's unstable. 
  And for a while, it's magic. 
  [QUIETLY] : Magic. 
  And then - What happened? 
  - You had a bad dream. 
  he turned me around. 
  So we find a desert island and live alone. 
  I think about that, too. 
  Giving up.
