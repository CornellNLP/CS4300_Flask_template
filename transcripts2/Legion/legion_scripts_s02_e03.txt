  - DAVID: I tried. 
  Either he's not here or Fukyama said these monks can control their thoughts. 
  SYD: Isn't it better if we can find him first, see what we can learn and then tell Farouk? 
  DAVID: Yeah, probably. 
  But he owes me some answers. 
  Hey. 
  What happened to you back there? 
  I'm not sure, but I I saw a flash, of you in the future.

  Live in it, my dear. 
  South of France. 
  Women. 
  Money. 
  Power. 
  And that's it? 
  No super-villain- destroy-the-world bullshit? 
  [FAROUK CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
  This word "villain" Do you know where it comes from? 
  C'est francais. 
  It means, originally, "one who lives in a village. 
  " A peasant. 
  Do I seem like a peasant to you? 
  - You know what I mean. 
  - No. 
  This is important. 
  Language. 
  The meaning of things. 
  You called me a villain. 
  Me, the king. 
  [SPEAKING PERSIAN] 
  For decades I rule over my country. 
  I'm a good king. 
  Strong but just. 
  My people, they prosper. 
  And then your father a white man, which is You tell me, important? 
  He comes. 
  Does he speak our language? 
  Does he know our customs? 
  And he decides what? 
  That my people should have better. 
  That he knows better. 
  Who is he to make such choices? 
  [SETS GLASS DOWN] 
  You fed off me when I was a baby. 
  And I'm supposed to feel, what, sorry for you? 
  Is it such a terrible thing to feel sorrow for your enemy? 
  What is he, except a brother with another name? 
  We're not brothers. 
  [POPS] 
  [WATER BURBLING] 
  You are still young. 
  You think justice is a glass jar. 
  You fill it with your hurt, your hate. 
  Don't you think I have my own jar? 
  I'm a refugee. 
  Do you know the meaning of that word? 
  Refugee. 
  Driven from my home, in exile. 
  Prisoner in another man's body. 
  Nobody put you in my head. 
  Or Oliver's. 
  You made a choice. 
  [CHUCKLES] : Of course. 
  If the choice is between death or life I choose life. 
  Listen, I'll call you when I have the monk somewhere safe. 
  He takes us to your body, and then you are gone. 
  Gone. 
  No one ever hears your name again. 
  Interesting, don't you think? 
  You're doing this for a woman you love who lives in a future you're going to destroy if you help me. 
  - What do you mean? 
  - The timeline. 
  She lives in a future you are trying to change, and when you do, she will cease to exist. 
  So really you are helping her to commit suicide. 
  Oh, and be careful with the monk. 
  He is very [SPEAKS GERMAN] 
  Contagious. 
  See, this, uh [TEETH CHATTERING] 
  madness. 
  They think it's me, that I'm infecting people. 
  But it's him. 
  He's toxic. 
  He is like Typhoid Mary. 
  But where he goes, I follow. 
  So your friends think that I am the Mary. 
  Not so smart, your friends. 
  I got to [GASPING BREATHS] 
  Cary? 
  DAVID: Hello? 
  Guys? 
  [CLACK IN DISTANCE]

  [RATTLING NEARBY] 
  - Ow! 
  Ow! 
  - Oh! 
  Oh, oh, I'm sorry. 
  - Geez, it's me. 
  Aah. 
  - Sorry. 
  I-I'm sorry. 
  sh1t! 
  What is that? 
  - It's just - It's so lemony. 
  - Some household cleaner. 
  - [GROANS, SNIFFLES] 
  Wh Where is everybody? 
  I don't know. 
  There were alarms. 
  I heard guns. 
  And Kerry went. 
  But I-I'm not physically brave. 
  - So I - Okay, hold on. 
  [ECHOING] : Syd? 
  Melanie? 
  Clark? 
  They're not answering. 
  We're gonna have to find them. 
  - I saw him. 
  - What? 
  The monk. 
  He had the children, the soldiers that were following him. 
  I thought they were immune. 
  To the disease. 
  But he was humming a tune that was very catchy. 
  Keep your eyes out for a cow. 
  Cow? 
  [WHISPERS] 
  : Syd? 
  [WHISPERS] 
  : David. 
  [TEETH CHATTERING] 
  DAVID: sh1t. 
  He's in there, right? 
  His mind somewhere? 
  Oh, yes. 
  Brain readings remain normal. 
  His mind is active, we just don't know what it's doing. 
  They're in the maze. 
  Meaning? 
  I don't know. 
  Let's find out. 
  [BIRDS SINGING] 
  Now, is this Well, we're inside his mind. 
  Oh. 
  It's nice. 
  David. 
  [CLIPPERS SNIP] 
  Oh Ew. 
  - Hello. 
  - Hey, man. 
  It's David and Cary. 
  Do you Hello. 
  It-It's David. 
  We're The monk infected you. 
  We're here to, I guess, rescue you? 
  PTONOMY: Hello. 
  DAVID: What's wrong with him? 
  I don't know. 
  Is this where everybody goes? 
  When they get infected? 
  Some kind of floral astral plane. 
  Do you sense anyone else here? 
  Nope. 
  Then it's his maze. 
  If I had to guess, I'd say the contagion locks people inside their own brains. 
  Inside their own realities. 
  Yeah, this is Ptonomy's maze. 
  Yeah, but gardening? 
  It isn't gardening. 
  It's that he doesn't remember us. 
  See? 
  He forgets what he's doing after every rose, and then the shears and the basket, they remind him. 
  So what are you saying? 
  It's a fantasy. 
  Or maybe I should say a core desire. 
  Our friend here is a memory machine. 
  He remembers every moment of every day. 
  Now if that was your condition, what might you wish for? 
  To forget. 
  I mean, it's beautiful, really. 
  To live in the moment No past, no future. 
  DAVID: Yeah, but it's not real. 
  CARY: It's real to him. 
  In this moment. 
  DAVID: What are you saying, we should leave him here? 
  I'm not saying anything. 
  I'm merely making an observation. 
  What if it was Kerry? 
  You're right. 
  Wake him up. 
  How? 
  I don't know. 
  You're the psychic. 
  Hello.

  - Yeah. 
  Everyone's infected. 
  - Do I need my gun? 
  - No. 
 
 
 
  He has the kids The monk And they're armed, but they're kids, so I-I thought they were immune? 
  - Uh, pied piper, humming, it's a long story. 
  - Yeah.

  [GRUNTING, GROANING] 
  [SPUTTERS] 
  Ow. 
  DAVID: Is this Melanie? 
  Is she doing this? 
  CARY: I think so. 
  - PTONOMY: Where is she? 
  - Perhaps her core desire is to be omnipotent. 
  To control the uncontrollable world from a distance, so she's everywhere. 
  [QUIETLY] : The Minotaur. 
  - [TYPING] 
  - Look around. 
  [SOFT WHOOSHING] 
  [SIGHS] 
  Melanie? 
  It's David!

  Yes. 
  [DAVID RETCHES] 
  - Okay, that really needs to stop now. 
  - What's wrong? 
  Nothing. 
  It's I think Syd's in trouble. 
  We need to split up now. 
  Cary and I will look for Syd. 
  Melanie, you and Paul find Fukyama. 
  Oh, what if we see the monk? 
  Ask him what he wants. 
  Just don't get too close. 
  You should be immune now, but - We are? 
  - Yeah. 
  I did a little thing before we left. 
  You did a thing in my head? 
  DAVID: Just don't get too close. 
  What about the cow? 
  Leave it here. 
  I don't think I want a cow in my lab.

  [ECHOES] : Oh, fudge! 
  I'm sorry. 
  We want the weapon. 
  What weapon? 
  To kill the monster. 
  They did not tell us he was a monster and we took him in. 
  PTONOMY: There is no weapon. 
  VERMILLION 1: To Division 3 they told us. 
  If there is a problem, go there. 
  They will have the weapon. 
  [GROANING] 
  Will have. 
  Do not have. 
  A weapon was planned, but never built. 
  The body was buried. 
  Then a new crisis and another. 
  Over time we forgot. 
  Do not believe. 
  Where is the weapon? 
  Where's the body? 
  VERMILLION 1: No. 
  We do not say. 
  He is out there as well, looking for it, the Shadow King. 
  He must not find it. 
  The end of everything. 
  David. 
  He's the weapon. 
  VERMILLION 1: The King is too powerful. 
  His body, it will not drown. 
  It does not burn. 
  David can do it. 
  Do what? 
  Destroy the Shadow King. 
  VERMILLION 1: No. 
  We do not want his help. 
  He cannot be trusted. 
  He works with the MONK: Teleportation. 
  DAVID: Just-just quiet for a second. 
  Let me think. 
  And stop making people sick. 
  MONK: People don't matter. 
  Only the body matters. 
  Well, they matter to me. 
  They're my people. 
  But you help him, the King. 
  - And he will kill all of them. 
  - I am not I have seen your mind as you have mine. 
  - Look [GRUNTS]

  [DAVID GRUNTS] 
  Where's the body? 
  We're not afraid to die. 
  Nobody is gonna look, I'm having a really hard time finding the landmarks here. 
  Minds separated from bodies and Minotaurs in mazes. 
  You got a girlfriend? 
  - Girlfriend? 
  - Yeah, I got one. 
  Well, I-I got two, actually. 
  Well, no, just one, but in two time periods, which raises the question: is it just one? 
  Huh? 
  I mean, people change, right? 
  We change, so maybe she's different now. 
  In the future. 
  I don't The point is, I love her them. 
  And more importantly, I trust her. 
  And she told me things happen. 
  Okay? 
  In the future. 
  Bad things. 
  So I have to, I have to help. 
  It's complicated. 
  Look, just tell me where it is. 
  The monastery. 
  It was a valley and now it's a desert. 
  That much I know. 
  Destroy it. 
  I will. 
  No, you won't. 
  I promise. 
  Just tell me where it is. 
  I won't let anything bad happen. 
  It already has.
