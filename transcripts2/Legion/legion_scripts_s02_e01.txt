 [SLOW EXHALE] 
  Ooh, ooh Wah It's Tuesday, right? 
  What is? 
  Today. 
  I'm asking Is it Tuesday? 
  This is a conversation about time. 
  I try never to have conversations about time. 
  Ooh, ooh, ooh Whoops, my drink is empty. 
  LENNY: Hmm. 
  Oh. 
  Thanks. 
  [LAUGHING] 
  Is something funny? 
  [LAUGHING] : Yes. 
  We're trapped. 
  [BOTH LAUGHING] 
  [LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] 
  MAN [QUIETLY] : A labyrinth. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Groovy. 
  NARRATOR: There is a maze in the desert carved from sand and rock. 
  A vast labyrinth of pathways and corridors a hundred miles long, a thousand miles wide, full of twists and dead ends. 
  Picture it a puzzle. 
  You walk, and at the end of this maze is a prize just waiting to be discovered. 
  All you have to do is find your way through. 
  - [RAPID CLICKING] 
  - Can you see the maze? 
  Its walls and floors, its twists and turns? 
  Good, because the maze you've created in your mind is itself the maze. 
  There is no desert, no rock or sand. 
  There is only the idea of it. 
  But it's an idea that will come to dominate your every waking and sleeping moment. 
  You're inside the maze now. 
  You cannot escape. 
  Welcome to madness. 
  [RAPID CLICKING] 
  [ALARM BELLOWING] 
  [SLOW ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING]

  MAN [OVER SPEAKER] : Reminder: beware of ideas that are not your own. 
  - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
  - Reminder: beware of ideas that are not your own. 
  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, DOOR OPENS] 
  KERRY: They found him. 
  SYD: Who? 
  KERRY: I hate it when you do that. 
  SYD: I'm practicing. 
  [CAT PURRING] 
  Who'd they find? 
  David. 
  [CAT MEOWS] 
  [MAN SPEAKING JAPANESE OVER SPEAKER] 
  ORWELL: His blood pressure is 90/120. 
  CARY: Just like the others. 
  ORWELL: Is he infected? 
  I don't think so. 
  His brain function is consistent with my previous scan. 
  ORWELL: So why doesn't he respond? 
  CARY: I don't know. 
  [SOFT BEEPING] 
  It's possible that his mind is locked in the astral plane. 
  [MACHINE WHIRRING, RHYTHMIC BREATHING] 
  We've seen it before. 
  Master says if there is any risk The telepath is infected, we should terminate. 
  CLARK: No. 
  His mind is strong. 
  He can resist it. 
  You'll see. 
  - This is ridiculous. 
  - [AIR HISSES] 
  - ORWELL: Dr. 
  Loudermilk. 
  - CARY: David. 
  - [ALARM BLARING] 
  - David. 
  David. 
  [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER SPEAKER] 
  [GUARDS CHANTING] 
  MAN [OVER SPEAKER] : 702. 
  [ALARMS BLARING] 
  [BEEP, WHOOSHING] 
  CARY: David, if you can hear me, speak to me. 
  [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER SPEAKER] 
  David. 
  [ALARM CONTINUES BLARING] 
  Kerry! 
  Hey, boys. 
  [ALARM CONTINUES BLARING] 
  Retreat. 
  [ALARM STOPS, WEAPONS WHOOSH DOWN] 
  David, if you can hear me, I need you to say something. 
  [INHALES SHARPLY] 
  Do you have any waffles? 
  [DAVID EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  MAN [OVER P. A. ] : Announcement four. 
  Any shift in reality may signal an attack. 
  If you feel something, say something. 
  [OVERLAPPING VOICES WHISPERING] 
  What are we so afraid of? 
  Everybody here, this whole building That's all I can hear. 
  Where are we, by the way? 
  What happened to Summerland? 
  This is Division 3. 
  Headquarters. 
  Is there a guy with, like, a a basket on his head? 
  Admiral Fukyama. 
  He's the boss. 
  Our boss. 
  Hmm. 
  What do what does that mean? 
  We work for Division 3 now. 
  Hmm? 
  Since when? 
  Wait. 
  Were there women with mustaches, singing? 
  After the Lazarus Affair, the divisions were created to study and defend against what people saw as a new mutant threat. 
  Division 1 is global command and communications. 
  Division 2 is pure science Genetics, technology. 
  Division 3 is the tip of the spear. 
  We do the day-to-day boots-on-the-ground engagement. 
  [WHIRRING, INDISTINC MALE VOICE OVER P. A. ] 
  [WHOOSHING] 
  [INDISTINCT VOICE OVER P. A. , RHYTHMIC GRUNTING] 
  After you left, Syd and Melanie convinced the leadership that mutants themselves aren't a threat. 
  Most of us are harmless. 
  We just want to live our lives in peace. 
  - - [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] 
  [INDISTINCT MALE VOICE OVER P. A. ] 
  So we joined Division 3 and started working together to fight our real enemies. 
  Your friend, the Shadow King, he's been priority one since the day you left. 
  Well you mean since yesterday. 
  [BEEP] 
  [INDISTINCT FEMALE VOICE OVER P. A. ] 
  What's the last thing you remember? 
  Uh [GASPS] 
  Uh Well, Farouk escaped in Oliver's body, and we were Syd and I were on the balcony. 
  And I could sense him heading south. 
  South. 
  And then there was an orb. 
  - [WHIRRING] 
  - SYD: No! 
  - [BANGING] 
  - Syd! 
  And it zapped me with, like, a-a-a ray. 
  [QUIETLY] 
  : Why are they children? 
  Under a certain age, we can't be infected. 
  No one knows why. 
  Infected? 
  With-with what? 
  We'll get to that. 
  But you're saying you got no memories at all after leaving Summerland? 
  No. 
  Well, I-I remember trees, I guess, and being on a roof downtown, and [INDISTINCT VOICES] 
  [INDISTINCT VOICES] 
  dancing? 
  [CROWD CHEERING] 
  Then there's flashes David, that was [TONE SOUNDS] 
  MAN [OVER P. A. ] : New symptom alert. 
  Unexplained malaise. 
  We'll talk later. 
  Okay. 
  - DAVID 1: Does he know? 
  - DAVID 2: Calm down. 
  - DAVID 1: I think he knows. 
  - DAVID 2: He doesn't know. 
  DAVID 1: Then why'd he leave? 
  That was weird. 
  Are you the magic man? 
  - [DAVID CHUCKLES] 
  - [INDISTINCT MALE VOICE ON P. A. ] 
  Hey. 
  [EXHALES] 
  Huh. 
  You look the same. 
  Thanks. 
  You look great. 
  SYD: You left me. 
  DAVID: I didn't mean to. 
  I was taken. 
  I'm sorry if I scared you. 
  We thought you were dead. 
  When? 
  For about a year. 
  - For about - 362 days, if we're being precise. 
  I found a gray hair. 
  I like cherry pie now. 
  So Where you been? 
  Well, I-I was with you, and then I was inside the sphere and the But that was yesterday, wasn't it? 
  I used to play these games with myself. 
  If I can hold my breath - - until the kettle whistles, he's alive. 
  [AIR HISSING] 
  - - [KETTLE WHISTLING] 
  [LOUD WHOOSH] 
  [WHISTLING] 
  [GASPS] 
  Syd. 
  What? 
  Can I kiss you? 
  You better. 
  [LOUD FOOTSTEPS] 
  [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] 
  ["WE LOVE YOU" BY THE ROLLING STONES PLAYING] 
  We don't care if you Only love we We don't care if you only love we Ah! 
  SYD: He's still inside Oliver. 
  We know that. 
  There have been sightings around the world. 
  He's looking for something. 
  We think. 
  We came close to finding him a couple of times. 
  [CROWD CHEERING, LAUGHING] 
  Then we got distracted by this thing. 
  The Catalyst. 
  [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] 
  We thought it was a weapon at first. 
  Some kind of biological agent. 
  Normal people would freeze like statues, except for that creepy thing they do with their teeth. 
  Then we realized, every time it happened, Oliver was there. 
  [GARBLED RADIO CHATTER, TEETH CHATTERING] 
  SYD: We think he's infecting people somehow. 
  It's not a virus, not a physical virus. 
  Cary thinks it's psychological. 
  - [TEETH CHATTERING] 
  - [TONE SOUNDS] 
  MAN [OVER P. A. ] : Announcement two. 
  Know your symptoms. 
  Confusion. 
  Irritability. 
  Obsessive thoughts. 
  Repetitive sounds. 
  Repetitive sounds. 
  Hopelessness. 
  Despair. 
  If you feel any of these symptoms, tell your mental monitor at once. 
  Syd. 
  Syd. 
  Sit. 
  So He's back. 
  This morning. 
  He looks good. 
  Hmm. 
  Oh, they always do. 
  Our men, with all their in, out. 
  In, out. 
  All their important things to do. 
  "World's not gonna save itself, dear. 
  " And off they go. 
  A day, a month. 
  A year. 
  Forever. 
  Admiral Fukyama asked if you're ready to get back to work. 
  - We need you. 
  - It's how they control us. 
  Their absence [CLEARS THROAT] 
  distracts us from our lives, the things that matter. 
  I'm not sure what you're trying Course, it's never their fault, our men. 
  God forbid we should have a feeling about it. 
  What choice do they have? 
  Destiny calls. 
  What kind of bitches would we be to stand in their way? 
  [KETTLE WHISTLING] 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - [WHISTLING STOPS] 
  Do you know what the saddest words are in the English language? 
  "Vacant lot. 
  " Don't know why. 
  Vacant lot. 
  I'm gonna Cary finished the tank. 
  David's gonna find Oliver, and he's gonna bring him home. 
  You'll see. 
  Here's what they don't tell you. 
  After they come back things are never the same. 
  ["I WOULD FOR YOU" BY JANE'S ADDICTION PLAYING] 
  Oh, baby I'm so tired [EXHALING] 
  The man from the government [COUGHS] 
  The man from the tax report The man in the public school The man owns the golden rule Yeah, I'm everybody's slave I made you my slave My slave, my slave, my slave, my slave You said this I do for you If it would help To give the world back What it gave Then I would Oh, oh I would I would I would for you. 
  NARRATOR: And now we must speak of Zhuang Zhou, who fell asleep one day and dreamed he was a butterfly. 
  For hours, he fluttered in the warm winter sun, until he no longer remembered he was Zhuang Zhou. 
  Suddenly he awoke, and he was Zhuang Zhou again. 
  But in that moment, he didn't know. 
  Was he Zhuang Zhou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly who was dreaming he was Zhuang Zhou? 
  A delusion starts like any other idea, as an egg. 
  Identical on the outside, perfectly formed. 
  From the shell, you'd never know anything was wrong. 
  It's what's inside that matters. 
  [CHIRPING] 
  Albert A had an idea. 
  One day, as he was walking, he stumbled. 
  And for a moment, it seemed that his right leg didn't belong to him. 
  This is how it begins. 
  The leg was clearly Albert's. 
  It was attached to his body, and when he pricked it, he felt pain. 
  But despite that, the idea grew. 
  - [GRUNTS] 
  - [SCREAMS] 
  Such is the power of an idea. 
  [SCREECHING] 
  With every day that passed, Albert became more and more certain - that this was not his leg. 
  - [SAWING] 
  He decided he didn't want it anymore. 
  And so one day, he went to the hardware store. 
  [CHIRPING] 
  You see, an idea alone isn't enough. 
  We have ideas all the time, random thoughts and theories. 
  - Most die - [CRACK] 
  before they can grow. 
  [SOFT CLICKING] 
  For a delusion to thrive, other, more rational ideas must be rejected, destroyed. 
  [SCREECHING] 
  Only then can the delusion blossom [SCREECHING] 
  into full-blown psychosis. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER IN DISTANCE, PEOPLE MARCHING] 
  MAN: David PTONOMY: What's the last thing you remember? 
  - LENNY: Hey, sexy. 
  - SYD: What happened in the nightclub? 
  [HEART BEATING] 
  PTONOMY: What's the last thing you remember? 
  WOMAN [OVER P. A. ] : Reminder: a loss of meaning is not normal. 
  Beware of ideas that are not your own. 
  Settling in? 
  You know what I realized? 
  I have no idea what he looks like. 
  - Amahl Farouk. 
  - Right. 
  He wears so many masks. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  There isn't much. 
  Uh, some sketches, rumors, a few Egyptian poems. 
  We think he came to be sometime in the early 1800s in Morocco. 
  He came to be? 
  Well, he's a mutation, like you, but you-you know how these things get blown out of proportion. 
  We're a superstitious animal, always turning the weather into acts of God. 
  Like, probably, the Devil was just some guy named Lucifer who beat up kids for their Lunchables, and then a few hundred years later [CHUCKLES] 
  Wait. 
  He's really that old? 
  [TONE SOUNDS] WOMAN [OVER P. A. ] : New symptom alert. 
  A strong urge to confess. 
  I've been, uh, giving you some breathing room, but there's an official conversation that we need to have. 
  Official? 
  I heard your story. 
  You were gone for a year, but it only felt like a few hours. 
  So we're gonna run some tests and carbon-date you, like you would a fossil, see what your cells say. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You think I'm lying? 
  You like soap operas? 
  My mother had leukemia when I was a kid and she was in bed a lot. 
  Kept me home from school, so I could keep her company. 
  It was a-a big king-size bed. 
  We'd eat ice cream, watch soap operas. 
  Anyway, we had a drinking game, except with ice cream Any time somebody had an evil twin or amnesia, we would eat ice cream. 
  I'm not lying. 
  Hold on. 
  [INDISTINCT MALE VOICE OVER P. A. ] 
  Sorry, what were you saying? 
  You know I can read your mind. 
  It was good to see you. 
  [GROANS] 
  I was kind of a fat kid on account of all the ice cream. 
  My mom was so nice, though. 
  She used to call me "husky. 
  " Died when I was ten. 
  I'm supposed to tell you to go and see Admiral Fukyama. 
  They're eager to talk to you. 
  Wait they? 
  WOMAN [OVER P. A. ] : New symptom alert. 
  A sudden decrease Hello. 
  Hi. 
  I'm David. 
  - DAVID 1 [CHUCKLING] : Weird. 
  - DAVID 2: Read his mind. 
  - DAVID 1: His mind? 
  - DAVID 2: Their mind, whatever. 
  VERMILLION 1: Our mind cannot be read. 
  VERMILLION 3: When we were a boy, we had the machine put into our head. 
  For days we screamed. 
  The pain was in the volcano, puncturing the molten core. 
  The device very deep in our cerebral cortex, like nails from a bomb in a public place. 
  Hardware inside software. 
  And now we are this. 
  The machine that bleeds. 
  The organizing principle. 
  Okay, well I've been someplace else, and now I'm here. 
  And we're gonna find him, the Shadow King, and put a stop to all this. 
  He is part of you. 
  DAVID 1: What do they know? 
  DAVID 2: Assume everything. 
  Be honest. 
  Well, we were together a long time. 
  I can still sense him, still feel him, but right now I think he's-he's hiding from me, so if there's a way you could boost my signal We have anticipated this. 
  Mr. Loudermilk has developed a device To help you recover your memories and find Farouk. 
  Cary. 
  Good. 
  That's good. 
  So when we find him, the Shadow King, what are you gonna do? 
  He will be terminated. 
  Right, but he's in the body of a friend of mine. 
  The scientist, Oliver Bird. 
  DAVID: Yes, Oliver. 
  A really He's a good guy. 
  You'd like him, if that's something you do. 
  Either way, he's a hostage, and we are not gonna kill the hostage. 
  The body must also be destroyed. 
  - The body? 
  - The body of Amahl Farouk. 
 
 
 
  His physical form. 
  Many decades ago it was hidden. 
  After his defeat on the astral plane. 
  By my father. 
  Farouk's mind is strong, but the mutations are genetic, meaning "of the genes. 
  " Physical, not mental. 
  - DAVID: What does that? 
  - On its own, the Shadow King's mind is powerful. 
  But were he to rejoin his body, he would be Unstoppable. 
  So, where is it? 
  This information is not available to us at the present time. 
  We are looking, as is the Shadow King. 
  So, you're saying it's a race. 
  We're in a race. 
  The male Loudermilk is waiting in his lab. 
  Do not fail. 
  How do you feel about small spaces? 
  I'm against them. 
  And when I say the words pitch black What exactly are you gonna do to me? 
  In order to boost your psychic abilities, I've created an amplification chamber. 
  DAVID: No. 
  The fluid is 80% glucose, 15% bicarbonate, and it's 5% strawberry extract. 
  - Why - It's for conductivity. 
  Also to give it a pleasant aroma and taste, in case you should swallow any, which, do not swallow any. 
  So, I'm supposed to find the Shadow King from inside a daiquiri? 
  While you're in the tank, I'll be using the resonator to bring up specific frequencies. 
  We can communicate, so if you see something, or if you want me to try a different frequency, you just let me know. 
  Okay. 
  What? 
  Clothes off, handsome. 
  Yes. 
  In order for the connectivity to be at maximum efficiency, we do need full exothermal contact. 
  So, get naked. 
  Very funny. 
  - What? 
  - We've talked about this. 
  You make people uncomfortable. 
  Uncom I make people uncomfortable? 
  You spent Wednesday walking around without pants on. 
  How do I make people uncomfortable? 
  All right, in. 
  That's in, in! 
  No, I don't I don't understand how [SIGHS] 
  [WHOOSHING] 
  I'm so sorry about that. 
  [SIGHS] 
  We're right outside. 
  This is a bad idea. 
  Ju-Just open your mind. 
  Open my mind. 
  Right. 
  Opening mind. 
  [POWER WHINING] 
  Ping me if he finds something. 
  Cary? 
  Yeah. 
  [WHIRRING, BUZZING] 
  CARY: Okay, here we go. 
  [ELECTRICAL BUZZ, BEEP] 
  [OVER INTERCOM] : All right, David, let's take this for a spin. 
  [WHIRRING] 
  DAVID [OVER INTERCOM] : You've used this before, right? 
  CARY: Yes, but only in a theoretical sense. 
  DAVID: What does that mean? 
  [ELEVATOR BEEPS] 
  You believe him? 
  Which part? 
  It's David. 
  That much I know. 
  And I saw memories. 
  He says he doesn't remember, but I saw memories. 
  SYD: A year of memories? 
  A few images. 
  He was in the nightclub. 
  I know. 
  You found him there. 
  He was there when Oliver was there. 
  They were there together. 
  SYD: Doing what? 
  Dancing. 
  So, you think Maybe the Shadow King still has ahold of him. 
  No. 
  You still trust him? 
  He's my man. 
  [OVER INTERCOM] : Orange 50, orange 20, red. 
  Red 15. 
  - [ZAPPING] 
  - Ah. 
  [SCREAMING] 
  Oh, sorry. 
  Okay, I'll-I'll dial it in.

  [SIGHS] 
  [LOCKER OPENS] 
  So, any luck finding Farouk? 
  No, I I couldn't see him. 
  What's it like in there? 
  What did you see? 
  Eh, nothing, really, just just a lot of random things. 
  Just noise. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You're keeping secrets. 
  What? 
  I know you. 
  I used to. 
  There's things you're not saying. 
  Syd, it's [SIGHS] 
  I-I know it's I know it's hard.

  Close your eyes. 
  Come on. 
  Okay, now, look. 
  - Where did you? 
  - I had Cary make it, when I was in the tank. 
  [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
  It's beautiful. 
  It's no ordinary compass. 
  Watch. 
  [SYD GASPS]
