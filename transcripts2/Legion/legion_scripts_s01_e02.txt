 Telekinetic, potentially. 
 [breathing heavily]

 Hi. 
 Hey.

 Um... what does she mean "memory work"? 
 David, your whole life, people have told you you were sick. 
 What if I told you that's a lie? 
 What if I told you every memory you have of mental illness... the voices, hallucination... was just your power? 
 And what if I could do more than just tell you? 
 What if I could show you... 
 Help you rewrite the story of your life? 
 Do... do we have time for that? 
 Didn't you say Division Three... 
 We'll make time. 
 You're very important to us, David... to me. 
 I need you clear. I need you focused.
