 Step outside of yourself. Make a connection with another being. 
 Can we do this another day? We can do it now. 
 Focus. Just throw the rock. 
 I don't think he wants to connect. 
 You're resisting. He can sense it. 
 He can sense it? What is he, like, a Padawan cat? 
 You don't seem to be getting this. 
 I get that this furball's trying to kill me. 
 Give me your lightsaber, and I'll make the connection. 
 Excuse me? 
 Sorry. I just don't see the point of this. 
 The point is that you're not alone. 
 You're connected to every living thing in the universe. 
 But to discover that, you have to let your guard down. 
 You have to be willing to attach to others. 
 And what if I can't? 
 If you hang on to your past, if you always try to protect yourself, you'll never be a Jedi. 
 Then maybe I'll never be a Jedi. 
 Kid, whatever's going on with you, you need to spill it. 
 I'm sorry, Kanan. I don't mean to wear you out. 
 Today's not a good day. It's never a good day. 
 Today? 
 Empire Day. 
 What are so many TIEs doing out this far? 
 Nothing good. Come on. 
 Not unless we have to. 
 Over here. 
 Tseebo. 
 What? Nothing. 
 He's not the one. 
 The Imperial HoloNet broadcast should play here at all times! 
 No one's requested it for, well, ever. 
 It's the law. 
 ...because today is Empire Day, celebrating the 15th anniversary of the galaxy's salvation, when our great Emperor Palpatine ended the Clone Wars and founded our glorious Empire. 
 On Lothal, Governor Pryce has commissioned a parade. 
 You heard the man! Raise your cups to Emperor... 
 Citizens, this is Senator-in-Exile Gall Trayvis. 
 I bring more news the Empire doesn't want you to hear. 
 I urge you to boycott all Empire Day celebrations to protest the ongoing injustices of the Imperial regime. 
 Shut this off! Can't. 
 It's the law. 
 We're done here. 
 So come see the parade and... 
 TIE pilots on search patrols? What's going on? 
 Imperials have locked down the ports and put Destroyers in orbit. 
 It's a full planetary blockade. 
 They're after a Rodian. 
 Just be glad they're not after us for once. 
 With what we've got planned for today's parade, they'll be after us again tomorrow. 
 Well, you're gonna have to do it without me. 
 Where do you think you're going? I just need to be alone. 
 Today has brought back some memories. 
 Why are they looking for Tseebo? 
 - Ezra. Mom? 
 - Ezra. Dad? 
 Ezra, we have to stand up for people in need, especially those in trouble with the Empire. 
 Tseebo. I know where he is. 
 Minister, I'm honored Governor Pryce chose me to organize this spectacle. 
 This is no spectacle, Commandant. 
 Citizens, I am Minister Maketh Tua. 
 Governor Pryce sends her regrets, but she was invited to Coruscant to celebrate with Emperor Palpatine himself! 
 Let's hear some enthusiasm! 
 Enjoy the celebration, citizen. 
 Okay, let's start the celebration. 
 Copy that. Commencing festivities. 
 Lothal is just as important to our Empire as any world in the galaxy. 
 And she wanted me to show you why. 
 Citizens, I present you with the latest vessel from Lothal's Imperial shipyards, the Sienar Systems advanced TIE starfighter! 
 Pretty, isn't it? Yeah. 
 I almost feel bad about blowing it up. 
 I sense we'll need to make a quick exit. 
 And who better to take this beauty on her maiden voyage than one of the best Imperial pilots on Lothal, Baron Valen Rudor. 
 Okay, when I say "now," throw this as high as you can. 
 Okay. Now? 
 Now? 
 Now? 
 Now. 
 Very good, Commandant. The governor will be impressed. 
 Thank you, Minister. 
 Another? Don't mind if I do. 
 You there. This area's off-limits. 
 Did you see it? It's so beautiful! 
 All the colors! It's like a... Like a rainbow. 
 Dad, what are you doing? 
 Sorry, mister. My dad is just so patriotic, you know. 
 Empire Day! I love it! 
 All hail our glorious Empire! 
 Right. Well, move along. 
 Thanks. Where you been? Making some connections. 
 How's the plan going? Just watch. 
 Yeah! 
 Who is responsible for this? Find them! 
 Nice of you to join us, kid. 
 Hey, where were you? 
 Why? Did you miss me? Yeah, right. 
 Been spoilin' to finish things with Agent Kallus. 
 Hey, if you want to take somebody out, take out that guy! 
 Fine. 
 Spectre-2, we're en route to the rendezvous. 
 Negative, Spectre-1. The streets are blocked. 
 I cannot, repeat, cannot reach rendezvous. 
 I know a place we can hole up till things calm down. 
 But "Shoulders" here might have a problem taking my route. 
 Then we need another option. Nah, it's fine. 
 Spectre-2, can you make it to the Old Market? 
 - Affirmative. I'm on my way. 
 Get back to the Ghost. Follow me. 
 We'll signal a new rendezvous when we can! 
 Over here! 
 I want schematics of the city's ventilation systems, sewers, everything. 
 Lock down the entire city. 
 Sir, yes, sir! 
 These rebels have ruined Empire Day! They must be punished! 
 We all want that, Minister, but our priority is still the Rodian. 
 That's an Imperial warning declaring this building off-limits. 
 What is this place? 
 You were coming here today. 
 This was your home, wasn't it? Where you grew up? 
 I grew up on the streets, alone. 
 Then why here? Why now? 
 Had this feeling. 
 Tseebo. Tseebo, it's me, Ezra Bridger. 
 That's the Rodian the Imperials are hunting. You know him? 
 Name's Tseebo. A friend of my parents. 
 But something's wrong. What's that thing on his head? 
 Empire's been known to implant lower-level technicians with cybernetic circuits. 
 Personality sacrificed for productivity. 
 Tseebo's productivity is 19% higher than average Imperial data worker. 
 Tseebo went to work for the Imperial information office after the Empire took my parents away. 
 Your parents? You never told us. 
 What's to tell? They've been gone for eight years. 
 I've been on my own since I was seven. 
 Seven. Imperial... 
 What's he saying? 
 He's detailing Imperial fighter deployments on Lothal. 
 That's it. Tseebo has intel the Empire doesn't want getting out. 
 Sabine, can you access it? 
 Think so. I need a few minutes. 
 Ezra. You okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 I told you, sometimes you have to let your guard down. 
 I said I'm fine. 
 
 
 
 Ezra Bridger. Son of Ephraim and Mira Bridger. 
 Born 15 years ago today. 
 Empire Day. 
 It's Ezra's birthday. 
 The risk you Bridgers take. Tseebo say you must think of your son. 
 He's all we think about! 
 We're teaching Ezra to stand up for people in need. 
 We're fighting for our son's freedom. 
 Tseebo not fight battle Tseebo know cannot be won. 
 Neither should Bridgers. 
 You'll want to see this. 
 What's with the old disk? 
 My folks used to do underground broadcasts from here, speaking out against the Empire. 
 It's probably just one of them. 
 What are we looking at? 
 It's... 
 Well, it's everything. 
 Imperial specs on the new TIEs and new T-8 disruptors. 
 Schedules of troop movements, tactics and strategies. 
 Half of it's encrypted, but it looks like there's a five-year plan for Lothal and every other world in the Outer Rim. 
 No wonder his brain's shorting out. All that data'd overload anyone. 
 The secrets in his head must be damaging to the Empire. 
 We'll need to smuggle him off Lothal. 
 Gotta smuggle him out of town first. 
 You know the only reason the Imperials haven't caught him yet is because their forces were occupied with Empire Day. 
 But the day's almost done. 
 Tear open every rathole in the sector. Find that Rodian. 
 I miss Zeb. 
 What? 
 Come on, Tseebo. Move it. 
 Commandant Aresko. 
 An Imperial troop transport has been reported stolen from the Lower City. 
 I'm on my way, but do not let it pass. 
 Acknowledged. We're ready. Positions! 
 That's far enough, rebel scum. 
 I have no plans on stopping. That's good to know! 
 Stop! 
 Punch it! 
 Fire! 
 Stop, I said! 
 I said stop! 
 This is Agent Kallus, ISB-021, calling the Inquisitor. 
 The rebels are through the main gate and headed south. 
 Their ship will be waiting. Slow them down. We're on our way. 
 The Rodian! 
 Get me closer. 
 Remember me? 
 Spectre-5 to Ghost. We're coming in hot. 
 Can see that. You got company upstairs. 
 Take them down! 
 Shields holding, but I need that transport taken out. 
 Chopper, you got this? 
 Okay, you're all clear. Pull over, and we'll... 
 Belay that. Have to be a scoop job. 
 Sensors reading multiple TIEs incoming. 
 TIE fighters will begin mass-production on Lothal within the next six weeks. 
 You're just full of fun facts. 
 You ready? Yeah. Autopilot's engaged. 
 This thing'll run till it's out of fuel. 
 Get in! 
 Go! Go! 
 Kallus to Inquisitor. The Rodian Tseebo is confirmed aboard the rebel vessel. 
 Acknowledged. TIEs, assume attack formation. Fire at will. 
 I need my gunners. 
 Shields won't hold long under this barrage. 
 Almost there. 
 Karabast! That came from behind! 
 Is that scrap heap even payin' attention? 
 I have to man the nose guns. I'm coming with. 
 Ezra? Ezra Bridger. 
 It is you! 
 Yeah, Tseebo. It's me. 
 But now's not the best time for a reunion. 
 Ezra Bridger... 
 What's he saying? He says... 
 He says he knows what happened to your parents.
