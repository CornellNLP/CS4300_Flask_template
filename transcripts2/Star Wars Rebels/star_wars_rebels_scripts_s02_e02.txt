 The destruction of our command ship has severely limited our ability to fight the Empire in this sector. 
 So maybe we don't fight. 
 Commander Sato, sir. 
 When things got tough for me on Lothal, I'd go find some place to hide. 
 You are never shy with your opinions, Ezra Bridger, but establishing a base is a good idea. 
 Problem is, none of the potential bases we know of have the tactical advantage we need to protect what's left of our fleet. 
 Or aid the nearby systems suffering from Imperial oppression. 
 We can't help others if we can't help ourselves, Kanan. 
 If only we had more allies. 
 I know someone who might be able to help us. 
 A great military commander with a vast knowledge of the Outer Rim. 
 He could assist us in finding a base, and his experienced leadership would make him a powerful ally. 
 How do we recruit this leader? 
 That's the problem. 
 I lost track of him a long time ago, and all my transmissions have gone unanswered. 
 We can find him. Let us try. 
 Well, there is one option I've not yet attempted. 
 Is that the head of an old tactical droid? 
 These droids were great at finding things, calculating. 
 Found my master and I a few times when we didn't want to be found. 
 How in all the galaxy is that droid gonna find your friend? 
 Well, I heard he was last seen in the Seelos system. 
 You can start there. 
 You're not coming with us? 
 I have something else to attend to. 
 The Sith Lord. 
 There are questions, questions that need answering. 
 I wish we could go with you. 
 You have your own mission, Ezra. 
 And, Kanan, if you find my friend, you must trust him. 
 If he's all the things you say, we can't afford not to. 
 Trust him. 
 What was that about? 
 I have no idea. 
 We get all the way to Seelos, and now you tell me the hyperdrive wasn't completely fixed? 
 You finished the important repairs? 
 How did you define "important"? 
 What's going on? 
 Chopper and I are staying here. 
 To clean up his mess. 
 Take the Phantom. 
 Hopefully we'll be ready to go by the time you get back. 
 Well, let's fire this thing up. 
 I think it's scanning for a signal of some kind. 
 Good luck. You could really get lost out here. 
 Maybe that was the idea. 
 What if this great commander we're looking for doesn't want to be found? 
 7-5-6-7.7-5-6-7. 
 It's homing in on something. 
 7-5-6-7. 
 There. Up ahead. 
 7-5-6-7. 
 Now that is a work of art. 
 Looks like an old Republic tank... used during the Clone Wars. 
 7-5-6-7. 
 Ezra, be on guard. 
 It's just a bunch of old geezers. 
 Well-armed old geezers. 
 What do you want? We're looking for someone. 
 Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's nobody out here. 
 Hey, does the number 7-5-6-7 mean anything to you? 
 What did you just say? 
 I said 7-5-6-7. 
 I haven't heard those digits in... 
 Well, that's my birth number. 
 Birth number? 
 They're clones. 
 Kanan, wait. Stop! 
 Jedi. They've come for revenge. 
 Drop the blaster, old man. 
 Don't try it, boyo! I'll gun you down. 
 Stand down, troopers. Now! 
 That's an order, soldier. 
 But he's a Jedi. A Jedi! 
 I know. I know. But they weren't the ones that betrayed us. 
 Remember? Wolffe, remember? 
 Kanan, Ahsoka said to trust them. 
 Sorry about the weapons malfunction. 
 My friend here is just a little defensive. 
 See, we haven't seen a Jedi since... 
 Well, it's been a while. 
 Well, my name's Ezra. This is Kanan. 
 That's Sabine and Zeb. 
 It's nice to meet you, 7-5-6-7. 
 Actually my name is Rex. 
 Captain, 501st Clone Battalion. 
 Meet Commanders Gregor and Wolffe. 
 We were sent by Ahsoka Tano. 
 Ahsoka Tano. 
 I fought by her side from the Battle of Christophsis to the siege of Mandalore. 
 And a friend of hers is a friend of mine. 
 Hey. You're a big one, aren't you? 
 Bigger than you. 
 Hey, hey. Easy with those, son. 
 Yeah, yeah. I might move the dust. 
 How is Commander Tano? 
 Well, in need of help. 
 We all are. 
 Look, we're trying to fight the Empire, but we're outnumbered, overmatched and taking a beating. 
 We could use your help. 
 Well, I'm not sure I'm much help to anyone these days. 
 Didn't you hear? 
 The Emperor said the clone army has out served its purpose and retired us. 
 Now we spend our days just telling stories and slinging for joopas. 
 This was a wasted trip. 
 You heard the clone. He's not interested. 
 Wait. You don't like the Empire, do you? 
 Well, the Empire certainly isn't the Republic, but you can't do anything about that. 
 You could fight. Sorry, son. 
 My days as a soldier are over. 
 Well, okay. Okay, then maybe there's one thing you can help us with. 
 We need a base. 
 Ahsoka said you knew about all sorts of secret locations in the Outer Rim. 
 Well, my memory isn't what it once was, but, there are a few spots I never bothered to report to the Empire. 
 Look, why don't you just wait outside and I'll put together a list of coordinates. 
 Listen, they are in some kind of trouble. 
 If we help them, we are putting ourselves in danger. 
 Wolffe, relax. 
 We got the situation under control. 
 Really? Really? What do you think the Empire will do to us if they find out that we are helping a Jedi? 
 Yeah, I don't know what the Empire would do, but I'm going slinging. 
 You know, I was thinking, since we're providing you with a list of bases, there's something you can do to help us. 
 No, thanks. Sure. What can we do? 
 Out there, deep below, roam the joopa. 
 Elusive big game. 
 When we're lucky enough to sling one in, it'll feed us for the whole year. 
 Okay. What do you need? 
 Him. 
 What? 
 Commander, we've received a binary transmission from an old clone unit on Seelos. 
 Something about a Jedi. That system is remote. 
 Haven't all the clones been decommissioned? 
 Yes, and while the clone's number checks out, he has a record of calls of delusional distress. 
 I wouldn't take him too seriously. 
 Send a probe to investigate. 
 All leads must be pursued. 
 Okay. You don't trust these clones, but they haven't done anything. 
 You don't understand. 
 They're dangerous. 
 They could... They could what? 
 Rex doesn't seem bad at all. 
 Ahsoka said to trust him. 
 You trust her, don't you? 
 You weren't there. 
 You weren't even born. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I don't feel like discussing it. 
 It was at the end, the end of the war. 
 Our fellow soldiers, the clones, the ones we Jedi fought side by side with, suddenly turned and betrayed us. 
 I watched them kill my master. 
 She fought beside them for years, and they gunned her down in a second... and then came for me. 
 Later they said they had chips in their heads that made them do it. 
 Said they had no choice. 
 I didn't betray my Jedi. 
 Wolffe, Gregor and I all removed our control chips. 
 We all have a choice. 
 Well, for what it's worth, I believe we can trust Rex. 
 If we're lucky, we'll catch Big Bongo today. 
 Let's get this over with. I'm getting hungry. 
 Keep on going forward. 
 Just a little bit more. 
 We're coming up on a hot spot! 
 Your hot spot looks like everywhere else on this desolate rock. 
 Out there. 
 All right, full stop. 
 All right. Just a little bit more. 
 Little more. 
 Oh, really? 
 You know, we really appreciate this. 
 I mean, we should do well today, with your friend here. 
 Yeah, well, Zeb packs quite a punch. 
 I'm sure, I'm sure. 
 But really, I mean, joopa supposedly love Lasats. 
 They love them? What do you mean? 
 Well, they say they love the smell, or I guess they love the taste as well. 
 And maybe it's about the texture. You know... 
 Wait, Zeb's not the hunter. He's the bait. 
 Hunter, bait, it's all the same. 
 No, it's not! 
 Zeb, you better get back here right now! 
 Zeb, what is that? 
 Buddy, run! You're the bait! 
 Zeb, it's gonna eat you! 
 Oh, karabast. 
 Zeb, run! Get out of there! 
 What are you doing? Run! 
 Zeb, no! 
 This could be him! 
 Our Big Bongo! 
 Hey, I bet you know a thing or two about mechanics. 
 Yeah, good bet. 
 Keep an eye on this regulator. 
 The line can overheat and shut down. 
 No line, no joopa, no Zeb. 
 Got it. 
 Well, what about me and him? 
 You got the best job of all! 
 When the line swings around, you'll charge it with the electro-poles. 
 Hit the line with the rod, and it'll send a bolt of energy down to the joopa. 
 Do it enough, and you should bring it up to the surface. 
 Here's one for you, General. Don't call me that. 
 I was never a general. My mistake. 
 
 
 
 Sorry, Commander. No, it's not... 
 Hit it! Now! 
 That's it! That's it! 
 He didn't like that! 
 Hit him again! 
 He's a runnin'. 
 Hit that line! Bring him up. 
 We're losing the regulator. Full stop, Wolffe! Dig in! 
 This is where we finish the battle! 
 I can't reach it! 
 Kanan, lift me up! 
 Sabine! 
 I know, I know. Working on it! 
 Got it. 
 Ezra? 
 Go! 
 It is Big Bongo! 
 What a smell. 
 Zeb! 
 Nice catch, old-timers. 
 Yeah! 
 Way to go. 
 Now that, that was impressive. 
 Impressive? You almost got my friend eaten! 
 Yeah. 
 I was in that thing's mouth! 
 Head to toe. 
 But look at you. 
 You brought in our biggest catch ever. 
 I... I did? 
 Actually, it wasn't so bad, Kanan. 
 I... I knew I had the beast from the beginning. 
 And you are a natural. 
 We held up our end of the deal, Captain. 
 Now it's time to get us those coordinates so we can go. 
 I'll get 'em. But you might consider staying for dinner. 
 It's gonna be delicious! 
 That thing tried to eat me. 
 Only fair I get to see how it tastes. 
 Can't say no to that. Right, Kanan? 
 Clones, huh? 
 Ahsoka's always full of surprises. 
 Well, don't get your hopes up. 
 The great leader's not coming back with us. 
 And you don't want him to. 
 I understand your fears, but I also remember when the Jedi and clones fought side by side. 
 They saved billions of lives, including my own. 
 I know. 
 Then maybe that's a start. 
 I gotta get back to these repairs if we're ever gonna get out of this system. 
 Signal when you're en route. 
 I've assembled a list of potential bases and clearance codes and a few protocols the Imperials still use. 
 Should be of some use. Thanks, Rex. 
 They're on our main computer. 
 You're gonna need... Data tapes? I got this. 
 You were brave today, kid. 
 You jumped right in there to help. 
 A great Jedi once told me that the best leaders lead by example. 
 You do that well. 
 Thanks. I've learned from a great Jedi too. Kanan. 
 You know, I don't think he likes me. 
 Or ever will. 
 Can't say I blame him. 
 The war left its scars on all of us. 
 Won't you reconsider joining us? 
 You know, I've out served my purpose for that kind of fighting, I'm afraid. 
 After the war, I questioned the point of the whole thing. 
 All those men died, and for what? 
 I guess what they thought was right. 
 The clones gave us up. 
 They warned the Empire we're here. 
 Wait, what? You're mistaken. 
 We would never do that. 
 I found the binary transmission to the Empire. 
 And there are messages Ahsoka sent to Rex, and he never answered her! 
 What? I never got any messages from Commander Tano. 
 I knew it! I told you, they can't be trusted. Kanan, wait. 
 Is this true? 
 Wolffe. What did you do? 
 I... I contacted the Empire. 
 If they found out that we were helping Jedi, they'd wipe us out. 
 Sabine, go warn Hera. 
 Tell her to scan for incoming ships. 
 I wanted to protect you guys, protect our squad. 
 The war is over. We are free men. 
 We can't live under the fear of the Empire for the rest of our lives, Wolffe. 
 That's not freedom. 
 You're right. 
 They're not our enemy. 
 I'm sorry. 
 A probe? 
 Kanan! 
 Oh, my. Look out! 
 Probes! I hate probes! 
 Rex. 
 You gotta make this right. 
 Yes! 
 Nice shot. 
 Rex got him. 
 Probe deserved it. 
 How long has this thing been watching us? 
 Long enough. 
 How's the Phantom? Well, engine took a direct hit. 
 We're not going anywhere until I can fix it. 
 Wait. You mean we're stranded? 
 Yep. 
 And the Empire's on its way.
