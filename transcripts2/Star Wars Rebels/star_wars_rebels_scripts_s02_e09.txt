 There, there, Alora. We're away from trouble now. 
 A new life awaits us both. 
 It's the Empire! They're seizing the ship! 
 We need to get out of here! 
 This is a civilian transport. 
 We were granted clearance for takeoff. 
 I'm afraid it's been canceled. 
 As fortune would have it, you carry a cargo of great interest to us. 
 No! 
 No! 
 Keep away. 
 Fear not, old one. We wish to make friends. 
 But first we have some business to attend to. 
 This is unexpected. 
 Don't get me wrong. It's always good to see you. 
 But usually it means there's trouble. 
 What I have to say is Jedi business. 
 Then I guess I qualify. 
 You qualify more than I do. 
 I've been monitoring transmissions from Mustafar to find out more about the Sith Lord. 
 And? 
 Information about him eludes me, but I've learned more about his Inquisitors. 
 It seems they have a secondary mission to make retrievals. 
 We know they hunt Jedi, so what else are they after? 
 At this point, I could only guess. 
 I managed to decode two sets of coordinates. 
 I'm on my way to investigate the first one. 
 And you want me to check out the second. 
 I'm in. 
 You should have Ezra join you. 
 He's already briefed on the mission. 
 Hey! She did say this was Jedi business. 
 Bring Zeb as well. 
 He proved himself against the Inquisitors before. 
 So, where are we going? 
 Did Ahsoka say exactly what we were looking for? 
 No, she just said we have to get whatever it is before the Inquisitors do. 
 Chopper, you have those coordinates? 
 Housing units? 
 What would Inquisitors want there? 
 I doubt they're renting. 
 Zeb, you take a look around the spaceports for the Inquisitors' ship. 
 If they're already here, I'd like to know. 
 Don't worry. 
 If I find any sign of 'em, you'll hear about it. 
 Bring Chopper. Stay in touch. 
 Help. 
 I'm here. It's okay. You're safe now. 
 Help me. Help my grandchild. 
 Your grandchild? 
 They took her. 
 The red blades, they knew that she has it. 
 Find her. She has it... 
 Rest. You need to rest. 
 I will find her. 
 I'm not following you anymore. 
 I've lost track of where we've checked. 
 Hey, where you going? 
 Okay, yes. You found them. 
 Congratulations. 
 I see it. It's one of those lousy probes. 
 If I never see one of those things again, it'll be too soon. 
 You can come out now. 
 Let's blast this ship and get outta here. 
 I really hope that's not a baby Inquisitor. 
 No, we can't just leave it here. 
 We'll blow up the ship after we get the baby. 
 What is wrong with you? 
 No sign of Inquisitors. 
 That's what worries me. 
 This is it. 
 Kanan, I think we're too late. 
 Over here. She's alive. 
 What's your name? 
 Oora. 
 Save your strength, Oora. 
 "Pipey"? 
 Her child. She thinks they came for her child. 
 Two red blades. 
 They didn't get it. 
 She managed to send her child away with a droid. 
 I promise you, Oora. We'll find your Pipey. 
 Oora, as soon as you're able to, get to docking bay 12. 
 Kanan, what do they want with her child? 
 I don't know, Ezra. 
 You're telling me there's another baby out there? 
 And it's headed your way. 
 When you find the droid, tell it that the mother, Oora, sent you. 
 Understood. On my way. 
 That one's all yours. 
 Garazeb Orrelios. 
 Honored soldier, feared rebel, baby hunter. 
 At least I'm good at one of those things. 
 Hey, droid! 
 Wait, wait, wait. I'm here to help! 
 Its mother, Oora, sent me. 
 That's right, Oora. She sent me for her child. 
 That's a baby? 
 I hope I'm holding it right side up. 
 There, there, baby... Thing. 
 It's okay, it's okay. 
 Karabast! Why'd it have to be me? 
 Kanan, I found the baby. 
 Already? You're pretty good at this. 
 Yeah. I know. 
 I'm taking it back to the ship. - Copy that. 
 We'll meet you there. 
 No, I'm sorry. You can't come. You have to act as a decoy. 
 That's not good. 
 That's really not good. 
 Watch out! 
 Spectre-1, making it back to The Phantom is not going to happen. 
 Copy that, Spectre-4. Where are you? 
 On the move. Ran into your two friends. 
 We'll be in the tower at the grid nine intersection. 
 Hurry. 
 Wait. 
 They are inside. 
 You will be my eyes out here. 
 This is grid nine. Tower should be just ahead. 
 Kanan, stop! 
 This is definitely the place. 
 Hey. Over here. 
 How's the baby? Quiet, for the moment. 
 Let's see him. I wouldn't if I were you. 
 It'll just start shrieking again. 
 I told you not to disturb him. 
 I was trying to be nice. 
 Well, try holding him. You have the talent to connect, use it. 
 Hey, hey. 
 What's wrong with it? 
 Ezra, you have to be calm to keep him calm. 
 Don't you think I'm trying? I don't know what to do with him. 
 Whatever you're doing, stop it! 
 You are making it worse! 
 Zeb! Get back, now! 
 Where to now? Only one way left. 
 Hold him! 
 I've got something they can retrieve. 
 Move, move! 
 Come on, Pipey. 
 If you keep this up, we'll never shake them. 
 Wait! Maybe that can buy us time. 
 Keep moving, and keep your comlink on. 
 
 
 
 They are here. 
 Are you certain? 
 You would question me, Seventh Sister? 
 Only when you're wrong, Fifth Brother. 
 Nice plan, but if you hadn't noticed, we've run out of floors. 
 They hunt Jedi, right? Instead of Pipey, let 'em hunt me. 
 Don't you mean "us"? 
 You have to get the little one outta here. 
 And I think I know how. 
 Use the cooling ducts. 
 I won't let you face them without me. 
 Hey, you made a promise to return this child to his mother. 
 And the best chance we've got to keep it is for you to calm him down. 
 I can't. He's terrified. 
 Because he senses your fear. 
 How can he sense my fear? 
 Because he's strong with the Force. 
 I should've seen it. 
 The Inquisitors are after these kids because they're like you, Ezra. 
 They're afraid the children could grow up to become Jedi. 
 All very illuminating, but as time is at a bit of a premium... 
 Don't have too much fun without us. 
 May the Force be with you. 
 Look, it's gonna be fine, Pipey. 
 All we gotta do is find a way down. 
 Well, hang on, little buddy. 
 We're gonna go for a ride. 
 They are close. 
 Don't waste our time again. 
 Pipey, quiet. 
 Calm down. Calm down. 
 Calm down. 
 Hey! 
 Kanan Jarrus. 
 You've crawled out of hiding at last. 
 Once I get you back to your mother, maybe you could come live with us on Garel. 
 You'd like that, wouldn't you? 
 Once I get you back to your mother, maybe you could come live with us on Garel. 
 Time for a new strategy. 
 Run! 
 I hope you know what you're doing! 
 A speeder! 
 I can't believe it! How'd you know? 
 I didn't. 
 Commander, send in reinforcements and lock down all spaceports. 
 We gotta take the long way, buy Ezra some time. 
 Go faster! 
 Yeah, you can say that again. 
 Let me in! Let me in, Chopper! 
 Paranoid droid. 
 The door is locked, Kanan! The door is locked! 
 I'm a little preoccupied at the moment! 
 I don't have time to waste on you, child. 
 Unexpected, but not unwelcome. 
 Ezra, get the youngling to the ship. 
 Come on, guys! Guys! Get up! 
 Get up! We gotta get moving! 
 What about Ahsoka? She's doing fine. 
 I know why you want the children. 
 Well, who doesn't want to be a mother? 
 We gotta go back for her. 
 If we get airborne, I bet she'll just come to us. 
 You are beaten. 
 Move in! 
 It looks like you are the one that is beaten. 
 Your capture will please Lord Vader. 
 Tell your master he'll have to wait. 
 That was crazy, but worth it. 
 They're Force sensitive. I've seen this before. 
 A Sith Lord attempted the same thing back in the Clone Wars, but the Jedi Order stopped him. 
 And now there's no Jedi Order to protect them. 
 Okay, I guess that task falls to us now. 
 Once I get you back to your mother, maybe you could come live with us on Garel. 
 You'd like that wouldn't you? 
 Once I get you back to your mother, maybe you could come live with us on Garel. 
 You'd like that, wouldn't you? 
 We would love to visit you on Garel.
