 The probe hit us pretty badly. 
 Repairs are gonna take a little while longer. 
 We don't have much time. 
 There's no telling when the Empire will get here. 
 We've got to get off the surface. 
 Well, the Empire's not our only problem. 
 There's a storm coming up behind us. 
 If the Empire gets here before we take off, the storm will be the least of our problems. 
 Here they are, the coordinates of every Republic base, Separatist installation, pirate hideout and smuggler's den in the Outer Rim. 
 Plus a few Mandalorian bases that even they've forgotten about. 
 Thank you, Captain. Sure you won't come with us? 
 Yeah, you're not bad in a fight. 
 I mean, for older gentlemen. 
 Yeah. Like I said, our war's over, kid. 
 Don't much care to get mixed up in another. 
 And say hello to Commander Tano for me. 
 But the Empire's on its way, and they will find you. 
 We can take care of ourselves. 
 Spectre-1 to Spectre-2. 
 Gonna be down here a while longer. Give me some good news. 
 Has the Empire showed up yet? 
 I'm a little busy finishing repairs on the Ghost, but Chopper's been scanning. So far, nothing. 
 Just had to say that. 
 Star Destroyer just came out of hyperspace. 
 Gonna power down so they can't scan me. 
 Once I finish my repairs, I'll come get you. 
 Good luck down there. 
 Sorry, buddy. That means you too. 
 If they follow procedure, they'll fly search patterns based on our last confirmed position. 
 Or they'll call. 
 Incoming Imperial transmission. 
 It's for you, Wolffe. 
 They called back? 
 They, they never call back. 
 This is why I don't trust clones. 
 Just get rid of 'em, Wolffe. Yeah, it was my mistake. 
 And I'll fix it. 
 CC-3636. 
 Commander Wolffe, is it? 
 Yep, that's me. 
 What can I do for you, sir? 
 Please transmit your coordinates so I can investigate the Jedi sightings you reported. 
 What? Jedi? 
 No, no. No... There's no Jedi. 
 Here. My old cybernetic eye must be acting up again. 
 Sorry for wasting your time. 
 This image was taken by one of our probe droids. 
 It clearly shows you harboring known rebels. 
 Now surrender them or be destroyed. 
 If it's a fight you want, I hope you brought a better class of soldier than those stormtroopers. 
 They serve the Empire well, and I have a great many of them. 
 You're gonna need all of 'em. 
 I like these guys. 
 They found us. 
 Guess that search pattern paid off. 
 Battle stations. 
 We're sitting mynocks on this thing! 
 Think so? Wolffe, evasive maneuvers. 
 Copy that. 
 Hurry! He's coming around for another pass. 
 Ezra, protect the Phantom. 
 What about the walker? 
 It can take a hit, I think. 
 Try shortening your leads. You're wasting ammo. 
 You're welcome to help. 
 Why spoil the fun? We haven't been shot at in years. 
 Yeah? Well, it happens to us every day. 
 Why doesn't someone man the big gun? 
 That's no good in this situation. 
 Kinda like you guys. 
 You want the shot? 
 Love to. 
 Gregor, you've still got it. 
 It's in my blood. 
 You know, we'd make a good team if we all fought together. 
 Yeah, tried that once. Didn't work out so well. 
 Now if that storm gets any closer, it'll ground us. 
 Sabine, we need the Phantom to fly. 
 I'm on it. 
 We have their location. 
 Shall we commence orbital bombardment? 
 No. Prepare for ground assault. 
 Sorry. I'm in your seat. 
 The traverse controls are over here on the left, and the elevation's on the right. 
 Really? 
 So, what was it like to fight in the Clone War? 
 I don't think the fighting ever got to Lothal. 
 I tell ya, war was never dull. 
 The general I fought with was among the greatest of the Jedi. 
 I trusted him with my life more times than I can count. 
 And I tried my best to keep that trust. 
 All right. With any luck, we can get outta here soon. 
 We can't just leave Rex, Wolffe and Gregor here. 
 Well, the Empire is here because of us. 
 We'll deal with the consequences. 
 Wait. Listen. 
 You hear that? 
 Enemy contact .24. 
 How many legs they got? 
 Looks like four. Four? 
 Well, how are they not falling over? 
 Will you look at the size of those things? 
 Reinforced armor plating, heavy cannons and antipersonnel blasters. 
 I'm glad you guys are so excited, but those giant death machines are on their way to blow us to bits! 
 Wolffe, set vector two-niner-zero. 
 Wait, you're just gonna turn and run? Just like that? 
 Well, if you've got a better idea, sir, now's the time. 
 I thought you clones loved to fight. 
 I do love a battle, but on my terms. 
 Gregor, drop the joopa. We gotta get moving. 
 Bye-bye, Big Bongo. 
 Wolffe, turn 180. 
 Copy that. 
 They're turning tail, but they can't outrun us. 
 Fire at will. Yes, sir. 
 Kanan. I'm not sure how far we'll get, but I think she'll fly. 
 Good enough for me. Zeb, we're going now. 
 Too late. The walkers are already on top of us. 
 He's right, Kanan. They'll shoot us down. 
 How will going into that storm be any better? 
 Well, the storm will scramble the scanners. We'll all be blind. 
 But a Jedi won't. 
 All right, everybody inside. 
 Sir, yes, sir. 
 Sir, we're losing them in the storm. 
 No, you are losing them by slowing down. 
 Full speed ahead. 
 That's it. I can't wait any longer. 
 Quiet. Quiet. They're right above us. 
 They must have finished their initial scan, but I don't want to take any chances. 
 Keep your power on low, and help me put this panel back together. 
 Really? 
 You won't be working much slower than you normally do. 
 We're not gonna be able to hide in this storm forever. 
 Those things are practically impervious to blasters, but they have one weak point in their armor, the neck. 
 One well-placed shot from the main gun should destroy it. 
 That's all we might get, one shot. 
 Scopes are dead, sir. 
 They think because we're blind, they have a chance. 
 Now we prove them wrong. 
 All units, 30 degrees left, flanking turn. 
 I don't know how we're supposed to shoot something we can't see. 
 I don't even know where the enemy is. 
 You don't always have to see something to know where it is. 
 If you're willing to trust me, I can get us that shot. 
 I always trust my general. 
 Prepare to stop. Now! 
 We should have found them by now. 
 Pincer maneuver. 
 Commander Wolffe, circle left, double time. 
 Full stop! 
 If what I'm sensing is right, we're surrounded. 
 What? 
 I know they're here. 
 What's your next move, clone? 
 You put us right in the middle of 'em to get us a shot. 
 It's crazy, but it's probably our best chance. 
 
 
 
 Once we fire, we'll reveal our location. 
 If we miss, it's all over. 
 I'll take the shot. 
 No, Ezra should take the shot. 
 Why don't you do it? 
 Kanan's right. We need one Jedi up there manning the cannon... 
 And another Jedi down here to lead us out of this mess. 
 You are the only ones who can see in this storm. 
 Sabine, spot him. 
 Hey, kid. 
 You might need that. 
 And hang on tight. 
 I gotcha! I gotcha! Come on! 
 Don't miss. 
 Hey, I never miss. 
 Ezra, there's a walker somewhere around. 5. 
 Somewhere around .5? Terrific. 
 Targeting scope's useless. 
 I can't see it. 
 It doesn't matter. You're not going to see it with your eyes. 
 The walker is there. Trust yourself. 
 Got 'em. Wolffe, there's your opening. 
 Go for it! 
 Focus fire on the energy burst. 
 Has there been any word from Agent Kallus? 
 No, sir. All communication and tracking was lost when they entered the storm. 
 Admiral Konstantine, we have an urgent transmission coming in. 
 Not now. We're in the middle of an operation. 
 Sir, the message is from Lord Vader. 
 We've been ordered to immediately rendezvous with his shuttle. 
 Hang on, hang on. Something's happening. 
 This is either really good or really bad. 
 You would think "bad." 
 Have you finished the last of the repairs? 
 Well, get on it. 
 Great shot, kid. 
 Now get yourself moving. This is your only chance. 
 What? We can't leave now. 
 We have to get the information they gave us back to the rebellion. 
 The other part of that mission is to bring Rex back with us. 
 We can't just abandon them. 
 You're not abandoning anyone. We're covering your escape. 
 Now, move. 
 We're soldiers, Ezra. This is what we were born to do. 
 Wolffe, bring us around. 
 The rebel ship is escaping, but Konstantine will deal with them. 
 Let's teach these clones just how obsolete they are. 
 Boys, this might be it. 
 At least we'll go down fighting like a clone should. 
 I'm with you all the way, Captain. 
 Kanan, you know better than anyone. 
 They won't give up. This fight is gonna be their last. 
 Come on, Wolffe. It's just a scratch. 
 Keep moving forward, soldier! Onward! 
 Intensify forward firepower. 
 I'm going for the legs, all four of them. 
 They've lost their minds! 
 We've been outflanked. 
 It's too bad about Captain Rex, but at least you got the intel. 
 - I'll rendezvous with you shortly. Copy that. 
 What are we gonna tell Ahsoka? 
 Rex was her friend, even though he was a clone. 
 I hate it when he's right. 
 I've got my problems with clones, but I don't want those men to die. 
 Gregor, I've lost power to the main cannon! 
 I know, I know. I'm working on it, Captain. I'm working on it! 
 Come out and fight, you cowards! 
 Finish them. 
 Just like the old days. 
 What was that? 
 Roomy. 
 Where's Konstantine with my air support? 
 Power restored. 
 Evacuate! Get to the speeders! 
 Looks like we live to fight another day. 
 Don't we always? 
 Well, we do when we've got a Jedi leading us. 
 Inquisitor, I thought Lord Vader was coming aboard. 
 I wasn't aware that you... 
 Lord Vader has sent me in his place. 
 Well, this unnecessary diversion may have compromised the success of Agent Kallus's mission. 
 We must return. I care not for your struggles. 
 I will succeed where you and Kallus have failed. 
 Commander. 
 You got old. 
 Had to happen sometime, Rex. 
 I'm glad you're still alive. 
 You too. 
 Well, I wouldn't be if it weren't for these guys. 
 Thank you for trusting my friend. 
 It wasn't easy. 
 It's still not. 
 Nothing worth doing ever is.
