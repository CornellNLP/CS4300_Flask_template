 Hera, shouldn't we be firing back? 
 Stay calm. It's all part of the plan. 
 Is getting blasted out of the sky part of the plan too? 
 Because if it is, then the plan's going great. 
 Ezra, you should know better. 
 There isn't a pilot in the Imperial fleet that can outrun me. 
 Yeah. So, how 'bout teaching me some of those high-flyin' moves? 
 You? Fly my ship? 
 I don't know, Ezra. You really think you're ready? 
 Not ready. Not ready! 
 Well, we've gotten ourselves into another fine mess. 
 I admit it's a little messier than our intel indicated. 
 Yeah. That's been happening a lot lately. 
 Where, may I ask, does this intel come from? 
 You may ask. 
 Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt, but could we maybe focus a little more on not dying? 
 Hang on! 
 It's okay. 
 Paint might be a little scratched, but no real damage. 
 There's damage. Steering's off. 
 Not what this says. It's what I say, and I know my ship. 
 Hey, I'm all for sticking it to the Empire, but what was in that convoy? 
 You never told us why the mission was so important. 
 I've told you before, Fulcrum's intel is on a need-to-know basis. 
 And I told you before, I need to know more. 
 Everyone okay? 
 We're fine, but I scraped the Phantom's underbelly. 
 You? 
 It was somewhat unavoidable, once your plan went south. 
 There we go. Knew there had to be a way this was my fault. 
 And you were right, dear. 
 Zeb, I'll need the Phantom ready to pick up the supplies from Fulcrum. 
 Adjust the steering and run a diagnostic. 
 Chopper and Ezra will help you fix any problems you find. 
 Really? Have you met them? 
 Hey! 
 And I'm leaving soon, so get to it. 
 What happened out there? 
 Well, we took out the target. Yeah. I got that part. 
 Fulcrum was right about the timing and route, but underestimated the Imperial defenses. 
 It's getting harder to anticipate the Empire's moves. That's for sure. 
 Yeah, about that, I'd like to know why we're relying on intel from this Fulcrum, whoever he is. 
 It's Hera's job to find missions that create problems for the Empire and profit for us. 
 If she trusts the contact, I trust the contact. No questions asked. 
 At the Imperial Academy, they didn't want me to ask questions either. 
 That didn't work for me. That's why I ended up here. 
 And we're glad to have you. 
 You are so frustrating. 
 Yeah, I've heard that before. 
 Fine. I'm done asking questions. 
 I'm telling you. I'm coming on your run to meet Fulcrum. 
 You know, you can be pretty frustrating too. 
 Learned from the best. 
 This diagnostic's taking forever. How's it going in there? 
 Hera was right. Steering's definitely out of whack. 
 But I almost got it fixed. 
 There we go. Life support filters need cleansing. 
 Chopper, as soon as Ezra's out of the repair duct, purge 'em. 
 All fixed! 
 Hey! 
 Perfect. Steering and life support are back in working order. 
 Nice work. 
 Sorry, kid. I told him to wait till you were out. 
 Not funny. 
 Hold it. We're not done here. The diagnostic's still running. 
 You can run a diagnostic on Chopper when I'm done with him. 
 Come back here, you little monongs! 
 Gotcha. 
 I take it you've finished the repairs? 
 You were right. The steering needed fixing, which I did. 
 And life support filters needed purging, which we also did. 
 Chopper! 
 I'm gonna "dismantalate" that nut bucket! 
 Leave a few bolts for me. 
 Let's go. 
 So what's the deal? 
 Is Fulcrum just another smuggler like Vizago? 
 Why all the secrecy? 
 It's no secret we're fighting against the Empire. 
 We need as many allies as we can get. 
 How do you find a way of answering questions without giving any answers? 
 Do you really want me to answer that? 
 Phantom, this is Fulcrum. Come in. 
 This is Spectre-2, Fulcrum. Why don't I talk to him? 
 Don't you dare. 
 Already at the rendezvous, Spectre-2. 
 Supplies are unloaded and ready. Should I wait? 
 Yeah, stick around. 
 Spectre-2 and I would love to talk to you. 
 Spectre-2, what's the problem? 
 No problem, Fulcrum. 
 Spectre-5 decided to help with the supply run. 
 Understood. Fulcrum out. 
 You know, an outburst like that is not appreciated. 
 Neither is all this secrecy. 
 So, where's the mystery man? 
 I don't know. Maybe Fulcrum didn't like your attitude. 
 I know I didn't. 
 I'll take that one. 
 Look, Hera, I'm sorry for the attitude. 
 It's just things seem to be getting more dangerous every day, and I need to know that you and Kanan can trust me. 
 We trust you, Sabine. We just can't tell you everything. 
 It's for the safety of the whole crew. 
 If captured, you can't reveal what you don't know. 
 You think I'd talk? 
 I think, we think, the Imperials can make anyone talk. 
 You've seen what they're capable of. 
 Yeah, I have. That's why I need to know. 
 You already know exactly what you need to know and no more. 
 I need you to trust me now. 
 And that's supposed to make me feel better? 
 Hera, you know what happened when I was a cadet at the Imperial Academy on Mandalore. 
 I trusted the Empire, followed its orders blindly, and it was a nightmare. 
 I want to believe we're doing good, making a difference. 
 But sometimes it seems like the harder we fight, the harder things get out there. 
 I feel like we can't take down the Empire on our own. 
 That's why I need to know this isn't all for nothing. 
 I need to know that I am not walking into another nightmare here. 
 What you need is faith. 
 Faith that there is a long-term plan that's bigger than you or me, bigger than Lothal, bigger than the entire Outer Rim. 
 Have faith in that and in us. 
 We... Kanan... He knows what he's doing. 
 Hera. 
 Look. 
 There were more crates, but someone's dragged them away. 
 Maybe he's still here. Who? 
 Fulcrum? No. 
 Well, who else knows about this place? Not sure. 
 This base was abandoned years ago, after the Clone Wars. 
 Besides, why drag them? Why not use the anti-grav? 
 Sunrise comes along fast in these parts. 
 Let's see what else comes along. 
 Whoever did this must have been pretty eager to get what was inside. 
 Too eager to just flip the latch and open them? Who would... 
 We're not dealing with a who. More like a what. 
 That's comforting. 
 You don't happen to know why this base was abandoned? 
 I'm starting to have my suspicions. 
 Sabine, run! 
 Whatever those creatures are, they can't take the sun. 
 Good, but do you see the size of that asteroid? 
 That's going to block out the sun for a long time. 
 How long? I don't know. 
 Long enough for us to become lunch. 
 Luckily we weren't planning on staying. All right. Let's get to work. 
 Last one. 
 Good. Let's go. 
 No, no, no, no, no! 
 
 
 
 We had nearly a full tank when we landed. Now we're out of fuel? 
 Hera's not here to save you now. 
 That's it! 
 Spectre-2 to Spectre-4. Come in. Spectre-2 to Spectre-4. Come in! 
 Go ahead, Spectre-2. 
 You did run a full diagnostic on the Phantom, correct? 
 Of course. - And you checked the results? 
 Spectre-2, there might be a small problem with the fuel line. 
 Small problem? Guys, we have a situation. 
 This is your fault, you and Chopper! 
 You were the one running the diagnostic. 
 You should have checked. 
 I'll check you into the wall. 
 We have to tell Kanan. But don't tell him it's our fault. 
 Okay. 
 Kanan. Kanan. 
 Hera and Sabine are in danger. 
 How could you tell? Could you sense it? 
 No. I could hear you two yelling outside the door. 
 We're on our way. Ghost out. 
 No way they get here before that asteroid blocks the sun and... 
 I guess we could hole up in the Phantom? 
 Judging by the torn-up shuttle in there, locking ourselves in the Phantom won't protect us. 
 Could get grim. 
 Well, I'll take grim right now. 
 Thought I recognized these markings. 
 Allow me to introduce you to one of my oldest and most explosive friends, rhydonium. 
 It's good to have friends. So what's your plan? 
 Since we don't know how many of those creatures are in there, we can set up groups of canisters and create explosions that take them out a wave at a time. 
 How will you get the creatures close enough to the rhydonium to be effective? 
 Well, we're gonna need bait. Where do we get that? 
 We don't get it. We are it. 
 Wave one. Move. 
 A lot of 'em. 
 Steady now. Follow the plan. 
 Fall back! Wave two. 
 Wait for 'em. 
 Now! 
 It worked. We just might survive this. 
 Wait. You doubted your own plan? Never. 
 Good, 'cause I sure did. Hey! 
 Come on. They're closing in. Wave three. 
 Wave four. Incoming! 
 Did I mention there are a lot of 'em? 
 Sounds familiar. 
 Light it up. 
 Coming in from both sides. 
 What about wave five? 
 We didn't have a plan for wave five. 
 Afraid of that. The Phantom? 
 Not inside. Go up top. 
 They just keep coming! 
 Tell me something I don't know. 
 We're going to die. That's no secret. 
 The light's not hurting them. Then we better move. 
 Sabine! I got your back. 
 These guys aren't so tough. 
 Karabast! 
 Kid, come on! 
 Nice moves out there, champ. 
 Chopper! Close her up! 
 No hitchhikers! 
 Kanan, we're all aboard. 
 Something's wrong. She's not responding. 
 Rerouting auxiliary power to the hull. 
 Didn't know the Ghost could do that. 
 There's a lot you don't know about my ship. 
 Chopper, reroute coolant to the engine. 
 Thanks for saving me back there. 
 Don't read too much into it, kid. 
 Engaging magnetic lock. 
 Look, Hera, I'm sorry about not checking the diagnostic. 
 We're all sorry. Right, Chopper? 
 Anyway, we'll fix the Phantom. Don't even worry about it. 
 Now, why would I worry? 
 Maybe because the last time they "fixed" it, we nearly wound up as lunch? 
 Right. That's why. 
 Sabine, I know you have questions, questions I can't answer right now. 
 But know that I trust you. 
 I just trusted you with my life down there. 
 I know. I know you do. 
 Good. We are making a difference, Sabine. 
 And I promise, we won't always be fighting this battle alone. 
 Do you think you can trust me? 
 I think I can try.
