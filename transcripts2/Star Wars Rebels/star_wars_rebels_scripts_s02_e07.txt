 Vaux, you're picking up our fighter parts in the market. 
 The crates are labeled "Ronto Meat." 
 And watch out for Imperial troops. 
 They've increased patrols. 
 Good luck. 
 You said you had another mission. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Actually, this one's for her. 
 Hey! 
 There's a courier coming in who has secret information. 
 I need you to pick him up and transport him to Havok outpost. 
 Sounds easy enough. 
 If it was easy, I'd send someone else. 
 This information is important. 
 We have to get it through. 
 Keep a low profile. 
 Don't worry. You can trust me. 
 What's this courier look like? 
 I don't know, but they'll respond to this code phrase. 
 Got it. 
 Hey, I can be low profile, too. 
 You can be backup, along with Chopper, but she is in charge. 
 Understood. 
 Leader? 
 Always figured you for a loner. 
 Not always. 
 You sure make it seem that way. 
 You spend a lot of time in your room, alone. 
 And you actually tend to eat alone. Sometimes. 
 And combat practice alone. 
 And go off probably to be alone. 
 And I don't know. I guess sometimes, you know, I'll find you alone... 
 After I've, maybe, followed you, and you're angry and I've heard you say more than once, "I want to be alone." 
 But actually, I've heard you say quite often, just straight, "Leave me alone." 
 Okay. What is that? 
 Nothing. 
 Garel Shuttle 3765 from Coruscant has arrived in Bay 22. 
 So how do we find this courier? 
 The code phrase is, "It's a long way to Alderaan." 
 I think it's this guy. 
 Hey. It's a long way to Alderaan. 
 Okay. 
 It's a long way to Alderaan. 
 It's a long way to Alderaan. 
 It's a long way to Alderaan. 
 It's a long way to Alderaan. 
 Hangar 22 is now closed. 
 It's gonna be a long way back to the Ghost if we miss the courier. 
 We couldn't have. Hera had confirmation he boarded the shuttle. 
 Are you sure you were saying the code phrase right? 
 Yes, yes. It's a long way to Alderaan. 
 What's the matter with this thing? 
 Wait a minute. That is the courier. 
 Talk about a low profile. 
 He came in with the cargo payload. 
 He's unit EG-86. 
 Nice to meet you, EG. 
 I don't get why they'd hide such important information in this binary box brain. 
 Well, would you suspect that thing of being a spy full of secrets? 
 No. I guess not. 
 That's too bad. 
 Because I would. 
 Ketsu Onyo. 
 I saw your mark, old friend. 
 Friend? 
 That's a generous term considering what happened. 
 You two know each other? 
 Still a bounty hunter, I see. 
 Tell me you don't miss it. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 You were a bounty hunter? 
 That explains a lot. 
 I don't think Ketsu's here for a reunion. 
 You know me well. 
 I'm just here for the droid. 
 Not you, Chop. Him. 
 So, Sabine, how do you know her? 
 She never told you how we broke out of the Imperial Academy? 
 That was a long time ago. 
 Before you got greedy and left me for dead. 
 You'd have been better off dead than joining this band of rebels. 
 I didn't believe it until I saw the Empire put a bounty on you. 
 You gonna try to collect on it? 
 Haven't decided yet. 
 Besides, I work for the Black Sun now, and I have another job to finish first. 
 I can't let you do that. 
 How 'bout we all relax before... 
 You there. 
 That happens. 
 Citizens, what's going on here? 
 There's a curfew on this hangar. 
 You need to leave immediately. 
 Don't interrupt us! 
 Nice shot. Haven't lost your touch. 
 Good thing you haven't either. 
 Stay here! 
 Okay, change of plans, Chop. 
 Get Boxy here onto that shuttle. 
 Sabine! Go! 
 I'm sorry, but there are no more flights scheduled for this evening. 
 - If you contact... Yeah, I don't have time to book a ticket. 
 Chopper, shut him down and take over. 
 That is unacceptable. 
 This is my ship, and I will not take "no" for an... 
 Bet you're glad you brought backup. 
 Yeah, it's working out great. 
 Exactly as planned. Now, hang on! 
 Hera, the mission's gotten complicated. 
 I thought you were keeping a low profile. 
 Yeah, well, it just went high profile. 
 There's no escape. We have you surrounded. 
 Hello, boys. 
 I'm afraid this has all been a terrible misunderstanding. 
 One that you're gonna answer for. 
 Now drop your weapons. 
 Don't do it. Do what? 
 This? 
 What the... 
 Hey! 
 No, no... No, no, no! 
 Where did she go? I don't know. 
 Bounty hunting scum. Garel's crawling with them. 
 I'm sure Ezra's fine. 
 Now, program the hyperdrive. 
 We need to get to those rendezvous coordinates. 
 We got lucky to get away so easily. 
 Scanning a ship? No. 
 Yep, that's Ketsu, all right. 
 She knocked out our hyperdrive, which means I bet I know her next move. 
 Lock yourselves down. 
 Too late! 
 Chopper! 
 Hang on! I gotta seal the hatch. 
 Next time I steal a ship, it'll be one with guns. 
 No hard feelings, Sabine. 
 It's not personal, just business. 
 And speaking of business, here's the deal. 
 Toss out the power droid, and I'll let you live. 
 And if I refuse? 
 I'll blow up the shuttle and scoop my bounty from the debris. 
 I don't believe it. 
 You better believe it. 
 I'll do whatever it takes to complete my mission. 
 No, I... I don't believe you can do it. 
 Maybe that's true, but I've changed more than you realize. 
 I have new loyalties now. 
 Right. Finally part of Black Sun. 
 Just like we always dreamed. 
 I got the best weapons, best ship, and I'm feared across the galaxy. 
 I can't believe I wanted that. 
 The Black Sun are slavers and assassins who don't care about anything but body counts and quotas. 
 They'd kill you too, for a profit. 
 Speaking of which, your time is up. 
 Now hand over the droid. 
 You can't do it. 
 I really wish it hadn't come to this, old friend. 
 What? 
 You? 
 That's my weapons array! What have you done? 
 So long, old friend. 
 I'll hold her steady. Just get him inside. 
 No, you don't. 
 Where's Chopper? 
 Calm down. What are you saying? 
 All right, Ketsu. Let's make a trade. 
 I'll extend the docking ramp and get your little friend ready. 
 I had a feeling she wouldn't leave you. 
 She was always soft. 
 Try anything, and I'll disintegrate you. 
 Stay here. 
 Well, well. While I've changed, it seems you haven't changed at all. 
 You're not giving up the courier, are you? 
 Nope. You're gonna have to take him. 
 And this astromech. 
 Not very smart, sticking your neck out for it. 
 Chopper's more than a droid. 
 He's a rebel and a friend. 
 Sabine. 
 We were once friends. 
 Tell you what. Give me the power droid, and I'll share my cut with you. Like the old days. 
 I don't do things just for money anymore. 
 That's right. Now there's "the cause." 
 You really think your little rebel group can overthrow the Empire? 
 Grow up, little sister. You can't be that foolish. 
 Once we were like sisters. 
 But we only cared about ourselves. 
 It's called survival. 
 You, of all people, should know you can't trust anyone. 
 I forgive you. 
 For what? 
 For leaving me for dead. 
 And I still trust you. 
 And you're wrong. 
 
 
 
 I met people who gave me a second chance in life, and that's what I'm giving you. 
 Imperial cruiser to Garel shuttle 63725. 
 Your craft has been identified as stolen. 
 Prepare to be boarded. 
 Looks like we're friends again. 
 Don't have much of a choice. 
 Hold position for docking. 
 Attempt to flee, and you will be fired upon. 
 Thanks to your little rust bucket, I've got no firepower. 
 And as long as we're docked to this shuttle, we can't use the Shadow Caster's hyperdrive to escape. 
 Chop, overload the hyperdrive on the shuttle. 
 What are you doing? 
 Buying us time. 
 Attention, Imperial vessel. 
 Please be aware, our ships have suffered extensive damage and are in danger of self-destruction. 
 I am scanning. 
 System failures in both ships and a hyperdrive coolant leak in the shuttle. 
 Shuttle craft, you have two minutes to stabilize. 
 Then we will be coming aboard. 
 What can you do in two minutes? 
 Watch. 
 Chopper, purge the reactor, then get over to the Shadow Caster and prepare to disengage the docking tube on my signal. 
 You're going to blow up the shuttle? 
 Which will get us the time we need to make our escape. 
 I should have known. You always liked to make things go boom. 
 Something I learned from you. 
 Still got the armory of explosives you used to carry? 
 On my ship. 
 Only friends I've ever needed. 
 Until today. 
 I'll plant them on the shuttle to give the reactor an extra kick. 
 That's the Sabine I remember. 
 Now you get sentimental. 
 Just get the Shadow Caster ready to fly. 
 Sir, I'm registering a power surge on the shuttle. 
 Imperial cruiser to shuttle. 
 We are reading a power surge on your vessel. 
 Your reactor core is unstable. 
 Contain the problem immediately. 
 It is looking pretty bad over here. 
 I'd keep my distance if I were you. 
 Whichever one of you thieves is in charge, identify yourself. 
 You should probably talk to the captain. 
 Hey, Captain. Wake up! 
 Not take no for an answer! 
 Your ship is under attack. 
 You need to exercise emergency protocol. 
 - Under attack? See that Imperial cruiser out there? 
 It's getting ready to destroy your shuttle for being stolen. 
 Destroy my ship? 
 Time to go. 
 Sir, the shuttle's thrusters are powering up. 
 Target the control hub. Disable it. 
 I think they're onto us. 
 Droid, release the docking tube, or we're all gonna die. 
 We have sustained severe damage. 
 Engaging emergency protocols. 
 Full power to the thrusters! 
 Warning! I have engaged emergency protocols. 
 Good for you! 
 Detecting a reactor malfunction. 
 How did that happen? Where am I? 
 This shuttle captain is bold, but foolish. 
 Activate tractor beam. Take hold of that ship. 
 Happy now, droid? Get us outta here! 
 Sir, the other ship is powering up rapidly. 
 Their hyperdrive is online. 
 Lock onto both ships. 
 It's too late. They've got us. 
 Not for long. 
 Are those explosives? 
 Reactor breach! 
 Status report! 
 Sir, the shuttle exploded and broke our lock. 
 We've suffered significant damage, and the second ship is gone. 
 You can report to Senator Organa that his intel has arrived safe and sound. 
 Let's get you home. 
 So this is really happening? 
 Last I saw these two, they were gonna shoot each other. 
 If I'm not mistaken, when we first met you, you were stealing from us. 
 Congratulations on the successful mission. 
 Thank you for helping our cause. 
 Well, it was mostly an accident. 
 I'm not sure I'm ready for a full-on fight with the Empire just yet. 
 No one ever is. 
 I'm Ezra. We almost blasted each other earlier. 
 I know who you are. 
 Sabine told me all about you. 
 She did? Well, what... What'd she say? 
 I mean, it was all good, right? 
 Ezra, can I get a moment here? 
 Sure. 
 You mean, you two. 
 A moment, right. 
 I'll just be over there. 
 You could've left me on that shuttle, taken the droids and made a good profit. 
 It's only money. 
 Thank you. 
 It must be nice to have people backing you up. 
 I had that once, when we were friends. 
 Haven't had that since. 
 Look, if you think you'd want to help us out, make a difference, just let us know. 
 I'll think about it. 
 That's a start. 
 Think that's the last we've seen of her? 
 No, and I'm glad.
