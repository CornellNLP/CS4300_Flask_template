 No, you're doing it from here. 
 It's up here, okay? It's like, "I'm Jay Baruchel. Uh, I don't know how to fly a plane, but I can train your dragon." 
 Oh, big news. 
 I'm assuming both of you ladies know who Trick Malloy is. 
 Sounds like a bisexual pool player. 
 Or an Irish magician. 
 He is a quarterback and the MVP for the Conquistadors. 
 Football team I'm part owner of? 
 Anyway, his contract is almost up, and he's considering retiring. 
 Was Trick short for Patrick? 
 I love last-half-of-the-name nicknames, like Topher, Xander... 
 Or Acob. 
 Ladies, ladies, I've invited him here for the weekend o clear his head. 
 I convinced him not to leave the team. 
 Now, he has a press conference on Monday. 
 Ladies, I need you both on your best behavior, all right? 
 And be careful of this one. He's a bit of a charmer. 
 [as Jay Baruchel] I'll try, but celebrities, uh, make me nervous. 
 [as Jay Baruchel] I'm an adorable... 
 I'm an adorable Canadian. 
 That's good. 
 [laughs] 
 What's happening right now? 
 Dueling Jay Baruchel impressions. 
 You both sound like sick goats. 
 Both : Perfect.

Or horror movies or something... Yeah, no, I get that fate stuff, you know what I'm saying, 'cause I'm kinda going through a little piece of that myself right now.

On and off the field, the rumors are swirling around this grid-iron bad boy. The pressure is mounting... both : Mounting. For him to make a decision. One thing is certain: when that decision comes, the world will be watching. That's what makes his choice so hard. both : Hard. No cheating! Oh, am I interrupting? I'm sorry. You're not interrupting! That's too loud. I mean, you're not interrupting. I just, uh, I wanted to see if I could sit in. That cool? I didn't do a lot of class stuff, you know? Football always came first.

[claps, chuckles] Wow, what a cannon. [chuckles] Now, you're gonna tell me hat you're gonna let hat golden arm go to waste? I mean, what is this, really? Some sort of a negotiating tactic? No, it's not about money. It's like I have a calling, and I'm tired of letting it just go straight to voice-mail. Ring, ring. Ring, ring. Sorry, I just overheard your metaphor. I was tending to the garden. Nice toss, by the way. That's the exact kind of throw hat would beat a soft nickel, assuming that the safety bites it on a fake pump, of course. Didn't know you knew so much about football, Billie. She doesn't. She's just trying to impress me. She doesn't know... she already has. [exclaims] Your beautiful lip color, with your scrunchie. [gasps] Thank you. You're welcome. Ugh! These things get so dirty, you know? Oh, get 'em a little wet, you know? Oh, squirter. That's weird that hey get so dirty. Don't they just sit in the water all day? I'm pretending they're penises. Okay, Trick, why don't we go inside? I'll show you my, uh, upside down room where all the furniture right over here is, you know, attached to the ceiling. Cool, I love not sitting down. Hey, since when did you start hand-jobbing the pool equipment? Same time you started using a hoe, ho. [suspenseful music] [hip-hop music] Good night. No, uh... Good night. Bonne nuit, Trick. Bonne nuit... [gasps] What are you doing? What are you doing? Both : Where... Where are you going? Just gonna go say good night to Trick, see if he needs anything before bed. Where are you going? I was also gonna go... see if he needed to be put to bed. Ass before class. Hey, Trick. Hey. Books, nice. I've read about those. Cool. Just wanted to come say good night. Thinking about turning in. Unless I stay up to, I don't know, have s*x. Okay, night, night. Oh... okay. [scoffs] Good luck in there. There's jizz all over the walls. [spits] No. My hand. [slurring] Good night, Trick. Excuse me? [pop music playing] [phone buzzing] You touching yourself to porno? No, Gene, I'm not watching porno. Yeah, me neither. Who watches porno? What is that, the "Labyrinth" in the background? You watching the "Labyrinth?" No, it's not the "Labyrinth." It's... I don't need to watch he "Labyrinth" to fall asleep. It's a different movie. Go to sleep. Nicholas Cage? Oh, Dickolas Cage.

Ooh, sorry, didn't mean o scare a fart out of you. I didn't fart, Gene. It stinks because no one's been cleaning up after themselves since Joy left. What are you doing? Just making some Belgian waffles for Trick. It's his favorite. I Google'd it. That's so nice of you. Well, you know, he's a guest. I figured we might as well be hospitable, and... Fun fact: his favorite lunch food is a BL... Bitch. Hey, Trick, I know waffles are your favorite. Probably need all the energy you can get after last night. You nasty. What? What happened last night? Well, let's just say you had s*x with Jay Baruchel, and it was good. [giggles] You mean that dude that goes... [as Jay Baruchel] "I wrote and directed 'Goon.' I wrote and directed it." No, I don't recognize that. No, uh-huh. Mmm, those waffles are really good. Gene, you don't have to do that. Don't have to do what? You know how you act all sexual around me? You don't have to do that. I like you. Come again? Spelled with a U. 'Cause see, when I hear hose words... Mm-hmm. All of this... Jesus. More feels like... it looks like this. Tears of... Tears. Tears of semen? Just let the sexuality go. You're more than your s*x. I cry when I listen o Lennie Annox. No, Annie Lennox, yeah, hat's... that's it. Whoa, I feel hella vulnerable. Yeah. [clears throat] What? Gene, can I talk to you inside for a second? Sure-cicles. Poor thing, all that diarrhea. She just found out. Bottom AIDS. Life is short, you know? Hey, Gene. Yeah? It's really nice o finally meet you. You too. What's up? That was not cool, Gene. Do you know how hard it is o make Belgian waffles without a waffle maker? [singing mock French] What are you... what? I'm sorry, all I hear is French music when I'm in love. What'd you say? You can't possibly think he's into you, can you? Mm, I don't know. We sort of have this "will they, won't they" thing happening, you know? Let me just cut to the end for you, hmm? They won't, okay? Did you just throw garbage at me? Me? No, I don't think so. Oh, wait, yeah, I totally did. It was a rhetorical question. Bitch! [both yelling] Come on, get your head on the ground. No, I'm uncomfortable by your v*g1n*... You want balls in your mouth. Eat it! Come here! Not the beets! Not the beets! [gasps] You look egg-cellent. Well, this just in. He's nacho man! Oh! Turkey slap! Salad joke! Yokes on you! Does this remind you of your childhood? Trash! Kent, thank you so much for your hospitality, but your house smells like garbage. Fair criticism. But I trust tomorrow's press conference will yield happiness, yes, yes? I think we'll both be smiling. Ooh. Yeah, maybe even laughing. This isn't a trick, is it? [laughs] Name stuff still happening. Yeah, come on, get in here. All right. [grunting] Listen, you... are my best and closest friend. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. [car engine starts] All right, see you, buddy. Yeah, man. [both shouting and making gun noises] Well, I guess we should get Joy back in here now that Trick's gone. What? He's gone? Mm. I think that went well. Mm, yeah, that went quite well. Bitch! No! Okay, truce. I wonder if Trick's gonna send me some sort of a signal. You know, like rub his nose or, like, pull on his dick. He's not going to. You're delusional. Can we just watch the news? Girls, girls, hush, hush! Shut it, it's starting. Thank you. Good afternoon, I think we all know that I've come to a bit of a crossroads in my life, and, you know, I got some really great advice from a really good friend his weekend. Hm. [laughs softly] And, uh... that advice was to remove the clutter. And that clutter is football. [reporters gasp] Kent Russell, I love you, and I would've never been able o make this decision. I was wavering, and you made it for me. Dude, I'm gonna follow my dreams. I'm gonna be a stand-up comic. No. I know it's crazy, right? I mean, how you guys doing out there? [phone ringing] What's the quarterback? Like, what's the deal with that name? Greg, my man! [laughing] It's weird, it's like some dude took your quarter. I don't like comedy. I didn't say that. I didn't say that! I see a lot of ladies out there. [in Rasta accent]: Love me the ladies, oh, hey. I met this girl, right? She's all like, "Oh, man, I like, cry every ime I listen to Annie Lennox," and I'm like, "Annie Len-nah, hat sucks, dude. Don't cry at Annie Lennox." You know what also sucks? Like, generally when, like, women are like, "Yeah, I like sports," and you're just like, "Go knit. Like, prune a tree or something or prune this dick. Mm!" [laughing] [clears throat] You guys are fun. What a train wreck. Yeah, like, turns out we're out of his league. [both laughing as Jay Baruchel] And don't even get me started on traffic, right? It's like... just all go the same speed.
