 Previously on Star Trek: Picard... 
 Dr. Jurati, you can tell me if it is possible to make a sentient android out of flesh and blood. JURATI: No one has ever been able to redevelop the science used to create Data. 
 Then came Bruce Maddox. 
 His theory was that Data's entire code, even his memories, could be reconstituted from a single positronic neuron. 
 He disappeared after the ban. 
 I have to go. Go? Where? Go how? 
 You have to take me with you. And I promise you, I will more than earn my keep. 
 You can't do it alone. 
 You need a crew. 
 I've already made the call. 
 I need a ship and a pilot. 
 And I have to find Bruce Maddox. 
 I have a pilot for you. 
 His name is Rios. 
 Chris Rios. He's just an EMH. 
 "Just?" 
 I'm, uh... I know who you are. 
 Deactivate EMH. 
 Raffi says you're the best around. 
 I never argue with Raffi. 
 Huh. Wise man. 
 I found Maddox. 
 Where is he? 
 On Freecloud. And once we get there, you're on your own. I'm just hitching a ride. 
 Hold on. 
 Where did that come from? 
 His ship's breaking up. Raffi, beam him in. 
 Do it. 
 Seven of Nine? 
 You owe me a ship, Picard. 
 Where's your cortical node, buddy? 
 It's got to be in there somewhere. 
 Bjayzl? 
 Seven? 
 It's all right. You'll be all right. 
 Go. 
 No, not without you, Icheb. 
 Then I'll s... I'll stay with you. 
 N-Now, Seven. 
 Please. 
 I'm so sorry, my child. 
 Ugh. What? 
 Bruce Maddox. 
 Here? 
 Indeed. 
 Huh. 
 How the mighty have fallen. 
 Kill him. 
 Wait. 
 New plan. 
 Bruce. 
 This is so unexpected. 
 You've looked better. 
 I've been in hiding. 
 They destroyed my lab, Bjayzl. 
 Darling, I heard. 
 Have some tranya. 
 They used some kind of molecular solvent to destroy the entire facility. 
 There was literally nothing left. 
 They nearly got me. 
 I'm so sorry, Bjayzl. For what? 
 I don't know how I'm ever gonna repay your loan. 
 Nonsense. 
 Who do you think did this, Bruce? Hmm? 
 Who's after you? 
 I think it was the Tal Shiar. 
 Well, that does change things a bit. 
 Making a deal with the Tal Shiar is... always such a pain in the ass. 
 Welcome to Freecloud. 
 Whether you are here for the maximum-security financial and information services or the minimal restrictions on personal liberty... 
 Come. 
 Freecloud keeps your secrets. 
 You're well? 
 I'm... functional. 
 Something to drink? Tea? Glass of wine? 
 Bourbon. Straight up. 
 This place is... something. 
 Not my idea. 
 But you like it enough to keep it. 
 What the hell are you doing out here, Picard? 
 Besides being in way over your head? 
 I'm looking for someone. 
 Does that surprise you? 
 I assumed it must be some kind of misguided diplomatic mission. 
 Saving the galaxy? 
 There may be a bit of that, too. 
 You're going to Freecloud. 
 You know Freecloud? 
 I hate the place. 
 But we... the Fenris Rangers... keep our money there. 
 What little of it there is. 
 It's a tough time on Fenris, I hear. 
 Does that make you happy? 
 I admire the Rangers' goals, their courage, their tenacity, but... you are taking the law into your own hands. 
 What law? 
 Point taken. 
 Nevertheless, to appoint yourself judge and jury... I'm not here for a lecture. 
 You think of me as a vigilante, fine. 
 Ranging is my job. 
 It's not saving the galaxy. 
 It's helping people who have no one else to help them. 
 It's hopeless and pointless and exhausting, and the only thing worse... would be giving up. 
 Mm. 
 Freecloud works. You can drop me there. 
 Who are you looking for? 
 Someone who has no one else to help her. 
 Someone who will likely die if I don't. 
 I'll take another one of these. 
 She's in there with him. 
 Huh? 
 The Ranger. She's in the chateau with Picard. Ooh. 
 What do those two have to talk about, I wonder? 
 Seems like they know each other. 
 No, I-I don't think so. 
 Not back when I knew him, anyway. 
 You know, she used to be Borg, like him. 
 Oh, wow. Mm-hmm. 
 She's thatRanger. 
 She's notorious. 
 Ninety-nine or Eleven or... Mm. 
 Uh-uh. 
 Mm. 
 She goes by Seven. 
 Seven. Mm-hmm. 
 The ex-Borg Fenris Ranger. 
 I heard she's from the Delta Quadrant. 
 Seven, the ex-Borg Fenris Ranger from the Delta Quadrant. 
 And I somehow managed to forget that Picard used to be Borg, too. 
 Must have happily blocked it out. 
 This is some strange cargo you brought me this time, Raffi. 
 Tell me about it. 
 Okay. 
 Ah. 
 Okay, I don't get it. 
 You replicated the flour, the butter, the eggs, the sugar and the chocolate chips... 
 Yes. And the baking soda. 
 Oops. Yes, baking soda. Right. 
 And then you set them all on fire... 
 I do not set them on fire. 
 I bake them. In my oven. JURATI: Oh. 
 Ow. Still warm. 
 Now, why don't you just replicate the cookies? 
 Because I do not like the replicator's chocolate chip cookies. 
 What can I say? There's an alchemy. 
 Come here, Aggie. 
 Taste it. 
 La Sirena, this is Freecloud Orbital Control, confirming transfer of conn. 
 Roger that. 
 Welcome, Captain Rios. 
 I see your power conversion efficiency is only 91%. 
 Remember, nobody knows their way around the Kaplan F17 Speed Freighter like the Red Bolian. 
 Care for a cuppa? Join the party at the Freecloud Grand Hotel's afternoon high tea. 
 Help! Make it go away. 
 The Freecloud Institute of Entertainment Robotics is now hiring... 
 You have to punch it. 
 Submit your résumé today. What? 
 Hit it as hard as you can. 
 I don't hit things. RAFFI: Oh, no, he's right, Doc. 
 You need to knock its head clear off. 
 Submit your résumé... 
 Agnes for the knockout. 
 Hey, lady, you looking to get snakebit? 
 Slither in to Feely's Venom Garden and pick your poison. 
 I didn't get one. 
 Uh, I found him, JL. 
 You found Maddox? 
 Yes, but... Oh, my goodness. 
 Bruce Maddox, what did you do? 
 I'm on a jobs board for interfacers. 
 Essentially, go-betweens for hire. 
 Big business for competing corporations, rival criminal gangs, thieves and their victims, especially on Freecloud. 
 I just sent myself an invitation to join the local 'facers guild. 
 Old Starfleet intel trick. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. Party named Bjayzl is holding him. They're looking for someone to broker a deal with the... 
 Tal Shiar. 
 Bjayzl. 
 You know him? 
 Her. 
 She butchers ex-Borg for parts. 
 She's been high on the Rangers' wanted list for years. 
 Couldn't we outbid the Tal Shiar? 
 No, not likely. 
 If she's prudent enough to use a 'facer, this is probably a pretty substantial deal. 
 We must extract him. 
 Uh, not with the security she's got. 
 Occluded payrolls show she's got a little army of private contractors. 
 And a Beta Annari. 
 What's a Beta Annari? 
 Sentient reptiloid. 
 Nasty pieces of work. 
 Without Maddox, we'll never find Dahj's sister. 
 Options? 
 Well, if we can't grab him and we can't buy him... 
 Then we're sh1t out of luck, JL. 
 Not quite. 
 We trade. 
 Give Bjayzl something she wants in exchange for Maddox. 
 Something she'll find irresistible. 
 Like what? 
 Like me. 
 Okay, I dropped a pretty foolproof ID of you into the system. 
 You are now a 'facer. 
 Famous but not too famous. 
 Prettyfoolproof? We're not exactly working with a whole lot of time here. PICARD: Raffi, are you serious, sending us down there looking like this? Well, 'facers tend to dress very flamboyant, JL. 
 It's protective coloration. 
 You're playing go-between. 
 You want to stand out. 
 You don't want anyone mixing you up with the other side. 
 What do you think, Agnes? 
 I think you're killing it. 
 But are you really a... 'facer? 
 No.You're licensed, paid up on your guild dues. 
 You have a meeting with Mr. Vup. Mr. Vup. 
 Yeah. Rios, you seriously, really need to sell this. 
 You can't do your broody, existentialist spaceman routine. 
 Your personality needs to match your clothes. 
 You need to show a little panache. 
 You need a feather in your hat. 
 A Temtibi Lagoon, if it's not too much bother. 
 And a game tablet. 
 With two umbrellas. 
 And if you can please let Mr. Vup know that I'm here. 
 The name is Rios. 
 Mr. Vup knows. 
 Feeling lucky, Mr. Rios? 
 Try to stay away from the lizard. 
 Beta Annari can smell when you're not telling the truth. 
 Seriously? Well, also, what you had for dinner and the last person you had s*x with. 
 If they're not the same thing. 
 Because that's not disturbing. 
 I'm Mr. Vup. 
 Of course you are. Salutations. 
 Please. 
 Let us not waste time. 
 Your references are sound. 
 Mr. Quark of Ferenginar was especially satisfied with your handling of his trouble with the Breen. 
 Yes, that was quite a foofaraw. 
 Are you aware of the identity of the other party in this negotiation? 
 Indeed. 
 Have you had dealings with the Tal Shiar before? 
 To be honest, I've tried hard to stay out of their way. 
 They are treacherous, violent, ruthless and subtle. 
 Their concept of honor is rooted in their skill at deceit. 
 So why represent them now? 
 Oh. 
 I'm not. 
 I'm here on behalf of another interested party. 
 I've come to offer your employer alternative remuneration for Dr. Maddox. 
 Surprising. 
 I'm not a fan of surprises. 
 I'm getting that sense. 
 Now, what could possibly be worth reneging on a deal with the Romulan secret police? 
 I can explain. 
 Maybe you aren't aware, Mr. Rios. 
 We Beta Annari have 1,253 olfactory receptor genes, which means, among other things, I can smell a lie. 
 So, Mr. Rios, proceed with caution. 
 Ay! Sorry. Sorry. 
 What the hell? Beta-blockers, anxiolytics, benzos. 
 Delayed release. Raffi's home cooking, honey. 
 Why would you do that? Just in case you do run into one of those hypersensitive reptiloids. 
 Should kick in right about when you need it. 
 That many implants in a living specimen. 
 Impossible. 
 How do I smell? 
 Truthful. 
 You also had some sort of smoked meat for breakfast, didn't you? 
 So many intact and functioning Borg parts in a single specimen. 
 She would be extremely valuable. 
 If you will indulge me with the smallest of transporter windows. 
 Honestly, Rios isn't the one I'm really worried about here. 
 I'm more concerned with you two. 
 Oh. I thought that I looked... 
 ...appropriately sinister. 
 Mm. No comment. 
 Assuming Rios doesn't choke or mess everything up somehow... Which he will not. 
 This is a transport pattern enhancer. 
 Once you get it inside their shields, it will create a stable tunnel to transport in and out of. 
 They won't be able to differentiate it from your implants on the scan. 
 Um, hands, please. 
 No offense. None taken. 
 Why? 
 Are you helping them, I mean. 
 When the evacuation ended and the Neutral Zone collapsed, someone needed to maintain a semblance of order. 
 I suppose at this point, it's... become habit. 
 I admire what you do out there. 
 With the Rangers. 
 Push in and then pull out... Yes. 
 I understand. Okay. 
 Once you get Maddox, activate the enhancer, and the doc here will beam you out. 
 Wait, wait, wait. Uh, hello? Uh, just... 
 Hold on a sec. Hold that thought. 
 Can you breathe? Yes. 
 What do you mean, I beam them out? 
 It's a lie. 
 Everybody is behaving as if they were somebody else. 
 Everyone except me. 
 He's clear. 
 And, Agnes, you're on transporter duty. 
 Really? Me? Okay. 
 How-how hard is it, really? 
 Piece of cake. 
 Aguardiente. 
 Ay.Eh. 
 Oh, man. 
 I don't know how to not be Elnor. 
 Then be Elnor. 
 An Elnor who never talks. 
 Disgusting thing. 
 Once they get the Borg inside them, there is no coming back, no matter what they think. 
 Defiled is what you are. 
 Damned. Cursed. 
 Quite a prize. 
 Rare to find one with so many implants still fully operational. 
 She is not one of the new ones. 
 When the Borg entered her, she was a jeune fille. 
 You are going to have to dice her up to get it all out. 
 A little squeamish, are we? 
 I can take my trade elsewhere. 
 No. 
 Not squeamish. 
 Not at all. 
 Your work is done. 
 Mind if I have another drink? 
 It's a free planet! 
 Let's see if there's a deal to be made. 
 Now, that's the kind of talk that I like. 
 But one last thing. 
 I need proof that my bounty is alive. 
 I need to see Maddox! 
 Gabriel Hwang located. 
 Stardust City Medical District. 
 Make sure the kid sticks to the script. 
 And watch your back. 
 Admiral Picard. 
 Time to go. 
 You've got this. 
 This is going to be very much harder without you. 
 It was almost like the old days for a minute there, huh? 
 I... 
 I hope you find what you came out here for. 
 And I sincerely wish the same for you. 
 Do it. 
 Don't get lost in the crowd. 
 At Freecloud Family Planning, your baby is our baby. 
 Join our family today. 
 Hello. 
 Wow. 
 Here? 
 So, what, did you put a tracker in me or just hunt me down? 
 Oh. I still hear things. 
 Maybe I hunted you down a little. 
 You just kind of crossed my path. 
 Path to where? 
 To Freecloud. 
 To you. 
 Gabe, I'm clean. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I feel good. 
 I was not there for you. 
 Even when I was there, I wasn't there. 
 Especially then. 
 But I'm here now, if you'll let me be. 
 For you and for my little grand...? 
 She's a girl.Oh. 
 You know, there was a time when it would've meant the world to me to hear you say that.Oh. 
 Oh, Gabriel. Honey... So, what, you're... changed? 
 Yeah, you're different now. 
 I'm-I'm... 
 I'm making a start, Gabe. 
 I'm... I'm-I'm putting my life back together. 
 That's why I came all the way out here for you. 
 So, um... the attack on Mars. 
 Tell me how it wasn't really the synths. 
 Honey... Tell me about the Conclave of Eight. 
 Tell me what was worth ignoring me and Dad until we hardly recognized you. 
 Why you abandoned us for some crackpot, tin hat conspiracy... It wasn't crackpot! 
 That attack was notwhat it seemed! 
 Baby, there is a conspiracy, and it is bigger than anybody knew. 
 There were lives at stake... 
 Our lives, Mom. 
 Our lives mattered, too. 
 Just not to you. 
 I don't think you understand just how much it sucked to be your kid. 
 Hey. 
 Pel. Baby, um... this is my mother, Raffaela. 
 She was just passing through. 
 I guess she had a second. 
 Hello. 
 It's wonderful to meet you. 
 Will you be staying a while? 
 No. Like I said, she's just passing by. 
 It's so nice to meet you. 
 Good luck with the baby. 
 Goodbye, Gabe. 
 Bye, Mom. 
 Show me. 
 As I was telling your Mr. Vip... 
 Vup... you will not see many more like her! 
 When they get assimilated as kids, more of the hardware remains inside them. 
 Ear, eyes, neck, chest, spine, kidneys, hips, various bones. 
 I thought it could be you. 
 "Hoped" might even be the word. 
 I always knew you were impressive. 
 I just never knew how impressive. 
 It is good to see you again. 
 Annika. 
 It's okay. It will be okay. 
 You can do this. 
 You have to do this. 
 
 
 
 What is the nature of your psychiatric emergency? 
 Your pulse and blood pressure are significantly elevated. 
 Be-Because you scared the hell out of me. 
 I'd like to give you a sedative. I-I don't need a s... 
 Agnes, you copy? 
 Are you certain? You really... Yes, I am certain! 
 Agnes? 
 Uh, yes. Hi. 
 Who are you talking to? 
 You. 
 Not youyou. N-No one. 
 Captain, Dr. Jurati's experiencing... 
 Deactivate EMH. 
 I'm here. The operative terms are "copy that" and "go ahead." 
 Something's not right. 
 We may have to abort. 
 Do you have a lock on them? 
 Uh, yes. 
 Um, affirmative. 
 It's, uh, showing red. 
 They haven't activated the pattern enhancer yet. 
 Let me know the instant they do. 
 Yes. Copy. Affirmative. 
 Um, whatever. 
 What's going on down there? 
 Are you still angry because I carved up your little friend for parts? 
 Or is it because you trusted me? 
 Oh, you were so noble then. 
 Save the outcast. 
 Rescue the forgotten. 
 You were so easy. 
 Was I, Jay? 
 Then how did I get away? 
 How did I escape the great Bjayzl? 
 A fortune in Borg tech and... you lost it. 
 You lost me. 
 No one's ever been worth more to you than me, and I slipped right through your fingers. 
 I'm the one that got away. 
 Not anymore. 
 Wrong, Jay. 
 Drop your weapons. 
 Listen to her. 
 Now! 
 What the hell is going on here? 
 I was not entirely candid with you. 
 Really? 
 Are we still pretending? 
 No, Elnor. 
 I think everyone has finally stopped. 
 Bruce. 
 How are you doing? 
 Picard? 
 Picard? 
 The famous Admiral Picard? 
 Well, it appears you thought you were playing when you were being played, Admiral. 
 I take it you had no awareness of Annika and my close, personal relationship. Shut up. 
 Take Maddox and go. 
 What do you mean? 
 She means to kill me. 
 But hero to the end, our Annika, she will first save your lives. 
 Just go. 
 You know, you were right. 
 This is not saving the galaxy. 
 This is just settling an old score. 
 You have no idea what this is. 
 Well, tell me. 
 What is it? 
 When the rescues ended, some of us tried to help maintain order on the worlds the Federation left behind. 
 We were based on Fenris. 
 One of us was a young science officer on leave from the USS Coleman. 
 He was out doing recon near Daimanta when his ship received a distress call. 
 It turned out to be an ambush. 
 He was the closest thing I will ever have to kin. 
 Like me, Icheb was a former Borg, rescued and reclaimed by Voyager in the Delta Quadrant. 
 That's why she wanted him. 
 His parts were... 
 ...good business. 
 Bjayzl had his implants stripped out. 
 Without anesthetic. 
 Without even the minor mercy of death. 
 I had met her on Fenris. 
 She was posing as one of us, as someone trying to help. 
 She knew about Icheb from me. 
 But... murder is not justice. 
 There is no solace in revenge. 
 You have had your humanity restored to you. 
 Don't squander it now. 
 You guys ready to go yet? 
 Take them. 
 Activate the pattern enhancer and get them the hell out of here. 
 You got it. 
 Revenge. 
 I understand the impulse. 
 But you do this, you put a bounty on all of us. 
 I don't give a damn. 
 But the kid and the old man, they don't stand a chance out here with a price on their heads. 
 Your friend has a point, Annika. 
 Let's make a trade. 
 Maddox for my life. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Look at the math of it, is all I'm saying. 
 You found her once. Odds are... you'll do it again. 
 Five to beam up, Doctor. 
 Come on. 
 I did it. 
 Oh, my God. Bruce. 
 He's in bad shape. 
 Exposure, dehydration. 
 Maybe other things. Best to get him to sickbay quickly. 
 I'll take care of him. 
 Aggie. 
 Aggie. Captain Rios. 
 Getting us the hell out of here, sir. 
 I'm glad of the choice you made. 
 It seems that a lift is the least I can offer you. 
 The Rangers already sent a corsair for me. 
 It should be here by now. 
 Ah. But... 
 I will take two of your phasers, if that's all right. 
 A vigilante could always use a couple more. 
 Of course. 
 And... in case you ever need a vigilante. 
 Thank you. 
 After they brought you back from your time in the Collective... do you honestly feel that you regained your humanity? 
 Yes. 
 All of it? 
 No. 
 But we're both working on it. 
 Aren't we? 
 Every damn day of my life. 
 Hi. 
 Well. 
 Frankly, I was surprised when you left. 
 I thought you'd bet on... shooting your way out. 
 I am. 
 How sentimental of you, then. 
 Risking your... revenge... while saving their lives. 
 Almost reminds me of... 
 ...the Annika of old. 
 Me, too. 
 Picard still thinks there's a place in the galaxy for mercy. 
 I didn't want to disillusion him. 
 Somebody out here ought to have a little hope. 
 Like you used to have... before I took it away from you. 
 Something like that. 
 You're stalling, Jay. 
 Your second security wave will be here in less than five seconds. 
 Annika... 
 He was a son to me, Jay. 
 This is for him. 
 Massive abdominal hemorrhaging. 
 Increase clotting factor by 12%. 
 They really worked you over. 
 Dahj... is dead, isn't she? 
 She found me. 
 And then I lost her. 
 I'm profoundly sorry. 
 When the Tal Shiar came for me... blew up my lab... 
 I knew. 
 Her embedded Mom AI wouldn't have activated her unless she was in grave danger. 
 Bruce. 
 Bruce. 
 I have to know... 
 Does she have a sister? 
 Yes. Soji. 
 Soji? 
 Where is she? 
 She's on the Artifact. 
 The Artifact? 
 You mean... 
 Not the captured Borg cube? 
 Why? 
 S-Same reason I sent her sister to Earth. 
 To find the truth. 
 The truth about what? 
 The ban. 
 There are lies upon lies. 
 They're hiding something. 
 Who? 
 I don't know. 
 It's the same ones who are hunting her. 
 The Romulans? 
 Not just them. 
 I think the Federation are involved. 
 That's what I sent them to find out. 
 Admiral, he's barely stable. 
 He needs to rest. 
 Understood. 
 I'll leave you to it. 
 The Artifact? 
 That's in Romulan space. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Flying into Romulan space doubles my fee. 
 Okay, jefe. 
 Old man indeed. 
 So... are we gonna talk about our stowaway? 
 Raffi? 
 Leave me alone. 
 Welcome back. 
 Aggie. 
 I thought I was dreaming. 
 It's me. 
 I never thought I'd see you again. 
 Did you... did you see her? 
 Did you get to meet Dahj? 
 No. 
 They're perfect. 
 Perfectly imperfect. 
 I did it, Aggie. 
 Soong and I. 
 And you. 
 Your contribution was... essential. 
 One more thing I have to atone for. 
 What do you mean? 
 What is the nature of your psychiatric emergency? 
 Your blood pressure and cortisol levels... 
 What is the nature of your medical emergency? 
 There's a high risk of critical organ failure unless hematic microrepair treatment is resumed... Deactivate EMH. 
 Aggie. 
 I wish you knew what I know. 
 I wish I didn't know what I know. 
 I wish they hadn't shown me. 
 I'm so sorry.
