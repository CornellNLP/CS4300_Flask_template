 Previous on Van Helsing. 
 [gun shot] 
 [gasp] 
 It's not possible. 
 I can help you find answers. 
 We can make ourselves immune. 
 Why don't you take this back to Chad and the rest. 
 Ha! 
 Who is she? 
 My daughter, Violet. 
 Yah! 
 Lily. 
 There's nothing that can be done. 
 I can fight the darkness. 
 They won't win, Lily. The light isn't dead. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Where's Troy? 
 Where's Troy?! 
 [growling] 
 Holy sh1t! 
 Get back! 
 Run! 
 [screaming in agony] 
 Run! 
 Run! 
 Stick together! 
 Don't let them flank us! 
 I'm trying! 
 [screams] 
 [screaming] 
 [screams] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [glass shatters] 
 Hey! Hey! 
 [fighting grunts] 
 Stay back! 
 [aggressive screeching] 
 Come get it, asshole! 
 [chainsaw buzzing] 
 [screeching] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 Get behind me. 
 You have to take off their heads. 
 [chainsaw buzzing] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [turns off chainsaw] 
 Watch your back. 
 You didn't finish him. 
 I think I know how to kill a vampire. 
 [snarling] 
 Take its head. 
 It's the only way to kill a daywalker. 
 Just take their heads off next time. 
 We clear? 
 Hey, wait. 
 You're just gonna leave? 
 Just like that? 
 I- I didn't plan on stopping. 
 But there's nothing out there but vampires and assholes. 
 Yeah, I plan on changing that. 
 The vampire part, anyway. 
 [laughs] 
 Okay, look. 
 The point is we obviously need you. 
 I mean, you're amazing, right? 
 So just stay and help us out. 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
 I- I can't keep doing that. 
 Doing what? 
 Killing. 
 Because there's another option? 
 Look, it's almost sundown. 
 Uh... stay the night. 
 Or at least let us give you something to eat. 
 Thanks, but I don't need it. 
 But you can't go. 
 It's uh, it's karaoke night. 
 At the pub? 
 We got the machine working. 
 [grunts] 
 You're quicker than you look. 
 Hands up. 
 Wait for your moment. 
 [charges] Ahhhhh!!!!! 
 [fighting grunts] 
 Dammit! 
 See? 
 That's how you wait for a moment. 
 Don't let your guard down. 
 [grunts] 
 Who let their guard down now? 
 [laughs] 
 Better. 
 No hesitation. 
 Get up. 
 Is there a point to all of this? 
 The training? 
 You? 
 What about me? 
 Well, it's not like you're here on your own free will. 
 It's better than the alternative. 
 Is it? 
 I mean, I'm trapped here, too. 
 All the action is out there beyond the guards and the barbed wire. 
 Yeah, well there's nothing wrong with being safe. 
 Plus your dad, he just probably- 
 Can we not talk about him right now? 
 Fine. 
 Tell me about this place. 
 Fort Collins? 
 This is one of the last remaining outposts. 
 We've been here for a couple years. 
 [laughs] 
 What? 
 All this training? 
 It's not for the outside world. 
 They're teaching you the wrong stuff. 
 Really? 
 Listen, kid. 
 You got some skills, and I'll give you that. 
 But they're schooling you to fight humans. 
 The real enemy? 
 Vampires. 
 And they do not fight like us. 
 Oh yeah? 
 Then show me. 
 You asked for it. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [gasping] 
 [choking] 
 Aaargh!!!! 
 You're dead. 
 Vampires are tactical. 
 They only want your blood. 
 Get the hell off me! 
 [grunts] 
 You're dead. 
 Vampires are relentless. 
 Even when you think you're winning, you're not. 
 Again. 
 [grunts] 
 [grunts] 
 Good. 
 Control your emotions. 
 [groans] 
 [gasps] 
 Oh sh1t! 
 [gasping] 
 No, no, no, no, no! 
 Oh my god, Julius! 
 I didn't mean- oh sh1t! 
 Help! 
 Somebody, help! 
 Somebody, he- 
 You're dead. 
 Daywalkers heal. 
 You come face to face with a daywalker you do not hesitate! 
 You take their head! 
 Dad wasn't bullshitting. 
 That's some party trick. 
 You can dream all you want about getting out of here. 
 You? 
 You're not ready. 
 Maybe I know more than you realize. 
 I'm not a prisoner, like you. 
 Meet me tonight and I'll show you. 
 Ain't gonna lie to you, Doc. 
 Not too sure how I feel about you right now. 
 Just trust me. 
 Okay? 
 You know I don't like needles. 
 Do you want a four-day hangover or not? 
 Just stop getting into fights that- hey! 
 Stop getting into fights that leave you like this. 
 Okay, okay. Can you- can we just count down from three? 
 Just- 
 Okay. Ready? 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 One... two... 
 [groans] 
 Your body heals alright, but your nerve endings, your pain receptors, are still heightened. 
 Remember that the next time you try taking on the whole world. 
 Well, it wasn't the whole world, it was just one girl. 
 And she did this to you? 
 [chuckles] 
 I like her already. 
 Look, I don't get why you're helping Hansen. 
 He's not wrong. 
 The guy just loves making people suffer. 
 He's a silver-haired asshole, but Avery, she's after the same thing we are so I figure if I can help her maybe she'll help us. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 The answer's in the blood. 
 What Vanessa has, what you've got. 
 The DNA sequence I ran on that blood from the necklace. 
 The genome was less than a tenth of a percent off human. 
 Look, I flunked seventh grade in 1903, Doc. 
 You gotta help me out here. 
 Right. Right. 
 Um... Mmm... okay... 
 Okay, we have the blood from the necklace and we have Vanessa's blood. 
 The two are virtually identical except something has changed. 
 Mutated, if you will. 
 And I don't know why. 
 But if I can figure that out we can use that goodwill to get Jolene and Flesh out of that prison. 
 Well, that's great, but what do we do in the meantime? 
 In the meantime? 
 We play along with Hansen, I cozy up to Avery, and she busts us out of this chicken coop. 
 [chuckles] Well, now you're speaking my language. 
 Jacob. 
 But two. 
 Weird. 
 [crowd cheering] 
 All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's give it up for Neil! 
 Seriously? 
 ♪ Hey! 
 ♪ Yeah, Neil! Give it all you got! Wooo! 
 ♪ What I like about you, ♪ Is you know how to dance, ♪ 
 ♪ You're here. 
 Amazing. 
 Want a beer? 
 There's no way you have beer. 
 Sit. 
 Monica was halfway through a micro-brewing course in Portland when the rising hit. 
 And there's a U-Brew up the road. 
 [clink] 
 Could have definitely benefitted from the second half of the course. 
 Almost tastes like the real thing. 
 Almost. 
 [power cuts out] 
 [crowd murmurs] 
 Sorry, guys. 
 I'll cook up a new batch of gas tomorrow, I promise. 
 Well, it was fun while it lasted. 
 Hey, keep me company? 
 I got first watch. 
 Okay. 
 C'mon, c'mon. Dammit! 
 Bad day? 
 No, no. 
 Um... quite the opposite. 
 I'm making great progress here. 
 I thought you'd figured out by now that we're on the same team. 
 The apocalypse hasn't really helped with my trust issues. 
 Fair. 
 But looking at your work so far... you're onto something. 
 Something big. 
 And I want to clear that path. 
 So if you wanna dump some frustration on me... 
 [sighs] 
 I am... I am so close. 
 I know. 
 I've seen the reports. 
 There's a missing link and I can't find it. 
 And this whole daywalker mutation is the link to all of that. 
 I... 
 You think you can cure this thing, don't you? 
 That you could eradicate the virus altogether? 
 I- I better get back to my work. 
 Don't worry, I'll put in a good word for you back at headquarters. 
 Where is that, exactly? 
 That is need-to-know. 
 That is not helping my trust issues. 
 Sorry. 
 You'll get there. 
 I believe that, okay? 
 If anyone can beat this virus it's you. 
 And if there's anything I can do to help, anything you need, let me know. 
 There is something. 
 I... I left someone out there. 
 She was shipped off to Loveland. 
 A criminal? 
 No, more like a protester. 
 She was only trying to do the right thing. 
 I'm not really supposed- 
 Please. 
 I need to see if she's okay. 
 That's all. 
 And maybe if I could look at some of your records? 
 I promise I'll only search while I'm waiting for tests to run. 
 Please. 
 She's all I've got. 
 I was on a school trip out of state when the rising happened. 
 By the time I found my way back home through miles of hell my family was nowhere to be found. 
 I've been looking for them ever since. 
 I guess they're dead. 
 Oh... 
 So now you just feel stuck here? 
 These people need me. 
 Someone like me. 
 What's your story? 
 I married young and divorced young. 
 I'm sick of men, so... 
 I have a feeling there's more to you than just an ex-husband. 
 I had a daughter... and a sister. 
 And they're... 
 Yeah. 
 To the ones we lost too early. 
 Sometimes I wonder, you know, why me? 
 Why did I survive and the others didn't? 
 Your number wasn't up. 
 That's what you think it is? 
 Just luck or chance or something? 
 I think there's a way bigger picture to this, or a purpose we don't see or don't even understand. 
 Yeah, I believe that. 
 I don't think anything happens by accident. 
 I think we're all on a path whether we see it or not, and the pain and the loss, it's just part of it. 
 I think I'm having a spiritual awakening. 
 I can't keep killing and killing and killing. 
 Well, if you ever find your way back here we could work on a duet for the next karaoke night. 
 Britney, Madonna? 
 How old do you think I am? 
 [laughs] 
 [clink] 
 ...Check out quarter 3. -Copy that. 
 [gasps] 
 Easy. 
 My wounds won't heal like yours, remember? 
 That was funny. 
 Alright, look. 
 I'm here. 
 Where are we going? 
 To where the action is. Low Town. 
 Wait, wait. Low Town? 
 Look, I don't think that's a good idea. 
 How is someone so big such a wuss? 
 I'm not a wuss. 
 Whatever that is. 
 Okay, look. 
 He's pretty rooted. 
 Let's just get outta here. 
 Wait. 
 He's about to leave. 
 Three... two... one... 
 How did you know he was gonna do that? 
 You think that's good, you should see me play cards. 
 The first thing you learn in military school Is how to swipe your own master key. 
 [beep] 
 Ready for a little adventure? 
 [door buzzes] 
 [street chatter] 
 Here. Come on. 
 ♪ 
 This ain't a place for a young girl. 
 Your patriarchal bullshit is really killing my vibe, Julius. 
 ♪ Hey. Give me a shot. 
 And she's back for more. 
 Put it on my tab. 
 Right, sure. 
 And uh, when are you paying that, again? 
 Another. 
 And one for him. 
 Who's this? 
 Julius. 
 This is uh, quite the place you got here. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 You wanna figure out a way to escape Fort Collins? 
 This is your chance. 
 You can buy anything in Low Town for a price. 
 Look, this place isn't safe. 
 Can we go, please? 
 I'll take my chances. 
 Besides, your luck sucks, so leave. 
 I'm coming back for you. 
 [clears throat] 
 So what's with the goon? 
 Who? Julius? 
 He's harmless. 
 So, who's hot tonight? 
 Other than you? 
 I'd watch out for eye patch on the right. 
 No one's luck's that good. 
 And the giant? 
 Desperate, got no balls. 
 Call his bluff. 
 One more. 
 For luck. 
 Ever think about maybe taking the night off? 
 Getting some sleep? 
 Dreams don't pay for themselves. 
 If I'm getting out of this hell hole, I have to work for it. 
 Well, to the future. 
 [clink] 
 ♪ Got room for me? 
 I don't play with females. 
 Oh. 
 How about now? 
 Pearl handled Tokarov. 
 Once belonged to Putin, or so the story goes. 
 This should clear the buy-in, right? 
 [grunts] 
 Looks like a seat just opened. 
 Thanks. 
 Still at it, huh? 
 Yeah, well, I can't sleep anyway. 
 You're sure not avoiding it. 
 Well, why are you still awake? 
 I find it easier to get things done when everyone else is asleep. 
 Here. 
 The records you asked for. 
 By records I kinda meant the computer kind. 
 Welcome to the future. 
 Not what we expected, right? 
 This is all that was salvaged from Denver. 
 If your friend is at Loveland there might be something on her in here. 
 Lots of people falling through the cracks out there. 
 I wish you luck. 
 [street chatter] 
 ♪ Beat that, suckers. 
 Nobody. 
 Nobody's that lucky! 
 [gun cocks] 
 You're lucky you got people watching out for ya. 
 Otherwise- 
 Otherwise what?! 
 Thanks for the fun, fellas. 
 No hard feelings, huh? 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 You think you can just walk out like that? 
 You owe me. 
 You think so, huh? 
 I close in an hour. 
 I gotta get back. 
 Always with the quick getaways. 
 Shut up. 
 Pretend we're somewhere else. 
 No problem. 
 I'd follow you anywhere. 
 ♪ 
 sh1t! 
 Uh, Julius, for a guy who says that he's leaving Fort Collins- 
 [growling] 
 Oh sh1t! 
 How'd you get in here?!

 [growling and snarling]

 No! 
 I got bit! 
 I got bit! I got- 
 I told you not to hesitate! 
 [vomits] 
 Oh my god. 
 Oh my god! 
 You're gonna forget this ever happened, you hear me? 
 You breathe a word of this and I will end you. 
 Do you hear me? 
 Hey! 
 Nod if you can hear me. 
 Get the hell out of here. 
 [gasping] 
 I'm gonna turn. 
 No, no, no. 
 Move your hand, okay? 
 Look at me. 
 What's happening? 
 You're not gonna say goodbye? 
 I thought I'd get an early start. 
 I figured you needed to sleep it off. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, hey. 
 What you said last night. 
 Um... about having a path. 
 What about it? 
 Every path leads somewhere. 
 A destination. 
 Sometimes it's a place, sometimes it's people. 
 What if you're meant to be here with us? 
 Maybe we're the end of your journey. 
 It just feels like you showing up was meant to be somehow. 
 I like you, Jack. 
 These people are lucky to have you. 
 But? 
 My journey's not over yet. 
 I take it one last sales pitch is pointless. 
 [laughs] 
 But a fresh hop IPA and a rap battle? 
 [laughs] 
 Like I said. 
 I know. 
 Safe travels.

 Don't move! 
 Stay right where you are! 
 Chad? 
 Vanessa. 
 [door buzzes] 
 Hey, listen. 
 Nobody knows. 
 It's gonna be like nothing happened, okay? 
 Like nothing happened? 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 You're not gonna tell my dad, right? 
 About any of this? 
 You can count on me. 
 Slow down. 
 It's been a while. 
 So, Mike? 
 That monster got him. 
 Sam. 
 And the kids? 
 Gone. 
 One by one. 
 I lost them all. 
 You shouldn't be out here alone. 
 Come on, let's get your stuff. 
 No. I'm fine. 
 I can take you somewhere safe. 
 I'm good where I am. 
 What was that trap about? 
 Um... the music attracts the vampires. 
 The booby traps snare them. 
 I make my rounds once a day and pick 'em off. 
 That trap wasn't set for vampires. 
 Of course it was. 
 They're not interested in ammunition. 
 I have to go. 
 Thanks for the bite. 
 I'll be seeing you. 
 I can help you, Chad. 
 No, you can't. 
 No one can. 
 Doc? 
 Over here. 
 Doc, I gotta talk to you. 
 Yeah, well I gotta talk to you first. 
 I got these files to help us find Jolene and Flesh, but you gotta help me search. 
 Listen, listen. 
 Don't you wanna find out what happened to them? 
 I do, but something's come up. 
 What's going on? 
 I'm not sure. 
 I mean... 
 [laughs] 
 I think I'm sure but I need to be sure, sure. 
 I need you to look at this. 
 Test the blood, or whatever. 
 Just test it. 
 Why? 
 I think I found another Van Helsing. 
 [groaning] 
 [hissing] Chad? 
 Chad? 
 It's alright. 
 I'm coming. 
 It's okay. I got something for you. 
 It's alright. 
 I'm sorry, sweetie. 
 There's not much there. 
 I couldn't find anyone today. 
 If I give you too much of me I'll be too weak to hunt I promise I'll do better tomorrow, okay? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Chad, you can't keep her like this. 
 [gun shot] 
 [cocks gun] 
 I won't let you take her away from me! 
 -She's all I got left! -Chad! 
 [Vanessa] I'm not trying to take her from you, I'm just trying to change her back. 
 Change her back? 
 You're just trying to trick me! 
 [groans] 
 It's not like that. 
 You're gonna kill her. 
 You're just pretending so I won't fight back. 
 I know it sounds crazy but I'm telling you the truth. 
 And there's no other way. 
 She'll die if she doesn't get enough blood and you can't continue feeding her like this. 
 I only took those people's blood and set them free. 
 I swear. 
 You know that's not true. 
 She's sick, Chad. 
 You can see that, right? 
 Tabby won't live long as a vampire and I have to try to change her back while she still has some strength. 
 No! 
 [hissing] Chad?! 
 Chad?! 
 Tabby? 
 Tabby, I'm going to try to help you, okay. 
 Chad? 
 He's right outside, sweetie. 
 You stay there and I'm gonna come in, okay? 
 [hissing] 
 It's okay. 
 Chad?! Chad?! Chad?! 
 [Chad] Tabby! 
 No! 
 I'm just trying to help you, Tabby. 
 [growls] 
 [sobbing] No! 
 Chad, it's okay. 
 We just have to wait. 
 Sometimes it takes a while. 
 Come here. Come to her. 
 She wanted you. 
 Take her. 
 She's warm. 
 Yeah. 
 But she's not breathing. 
 It's okay. 
 Sometimes it happens right away, sometimes it takes hours. 
 If she turns cold I'm going with her. 
 Don't say that. 
 It's true. 
 I won't go on. 
 I- I... I can't be- 
 [vomiting] 
 What's happening? 
 She's back. 
 What do you mean? 
 Chad? 
 Tabby? 
 Oh my god, sweetheart! 
 What are you? 
 The light. 
 Bus crash. 
 Nine prisoners deceased. 
 Two missing. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Okay... 
 You gotta be kidding me. 
 Julius! 
 Julius! 
 Julius? 
 [gasps] 
 Find something? 
 I can't wait to hear all about it. 
 Hey, no! 
 Don't, don't, don't! 
 No! 
 I hope you understand. 
 This is for the good of mankind, as well as my daughter. 
 Does she know who she is? 
 Or should I say "what" she is? 
 Violet is my adopted daughter. 
 That's all she or anyone else needs to know. 
 Don't do this. 
 Please. 
 Don't leave me in here. 
 I can help you. 
 Goddammit, she's the missing piece to this whole thing. 
 Please, just let me help you. 
 Hansen. 
 Hansen! 
 Hansen!! 
 Hansen!!! 
 Hansen, don't leave me in here! 
 Somebody help! 
 We'll be safe with them, Tabby. 
 Booby traps, huh? 
 Oh, he's genius at them. 
 A hell of a survivor. 
 Plus he's got a good heart and you can trust him. 
 Thanks for bringing him our way. 
 Take care of Tabby? 
 Absolutely. 
 I'll teach her how to make beer. 
 [laughs] 
 Take care of each other. 
 I'm glad I met you. 
 Me too. 
 Here. 
 I don't kill anymore. 
 I save. 
 You're one of a kind, I gotta say. 
 Look, I'm not great with goodbyes. 
 Then maybe we just say see you later. 
 Maybe. 
 [screaming] 
 I got bit! 
 You're gonna forget this ever happened, you hear me! 
 What's happening? 
 [birds chirping] 
 [thunder rolling] 
 It's okay. 
 Don't be afraid. 
 [gasping]
