 Previously: 
 It just feels like you showing up was meant to be somehow. 
 I found her. I found Jennifer. 
 They transferred her to someplace called Loveland. 
 Loveland is a prison colony. 
 Don't move! 
 Chad? 
 Unless you perform some heinous crime, you won't be seeing her anytime soon. 
 [gunshot] 
 No!!! 
 What are you? 
 The light. 
 I help you find your wife, you help me get back to Sarah, deal?

 Jesus Christ. 
 [laughing] 
 Hey man, thanks for stopping. 
 Did I have a choice? 
 [gun shot] 
 Hitchhikers, huh? 
 Watch it. 
 [cocks gun] 
 [gun shot] 
 Whoa, whoa! Easy, easy, easy! 
 Watch the... shoes, alright? 
 These are Italian leather. 
 You really think a ragtop's the way to go these days? 
 You can't let the end of the world cramp your style, can you? 
 You can't have that. 
 Have a nice day. 
 Yeah, right back at ya. 
 Hey, woah, woah, woah! 
 Can I get a ride? 
 There's more where that came from. 
 This is the good stuff. 
 Nothing but the best, that's my motto. 
 Grab your sh1t. Come on. 
 Alright. 
 My name's Max, by the way. 
 Max Borman. 
 And you, my friend, would be? 
 A fella that's gonna leave you on the side of the road if you keep asking questions. 
 Ha! 
 Okay, okay. I get it. 
 And tell me, that would be your Christian name? 
 I really don't think you wanna do that. 
 You should duck. 
 [gun shot] 
 Hold that for a second, would ya? 
 Oh! 
 [grunts] 
 [laughing] 
 [laughing] Oh, my god! 
 Whoo! Yeah! 
 Come on. We should have spotted her by now. 
 We have no idea how many more of them are in that mine. 
 What are the chances she's still alive? 
 We are, right? 
 What are the chances of that? 
 There's another bus full of prisoners. 
 Well, it's a prison camp. There's prisoners. 
 Yes, but these ones all seem injured or old. 
 Whoa. 
 Where's it headed? 
 Denver's the other way. 
 Out there is just desert. 
 Maybe there's another prison camp that way. 
 Maybe, but they were loading crates from the storage room. 
 Solicite and food all headed the wrong way. 
 What're you thinking? 
 I don't know. 
 But there's more going on here than just mining for Denver. 
 What? 
 That's her. 
 That's Jennifer. 
 That's my wife. 
 We'll get to her, Phil. 
 We'll save her. 
 Just stick to the plan. 
 We know how to get in, right? 
 Lucky for us no one breaks into a prison. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Is all this yours? 
 Well, possession is nine-tenths of the law, is it not? 
 Come on in, I'll show you around. 
 No, I'm good. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Just for an espresso. 
 Use the toilet. 
 I got some amazing fois gras, some artesian asshole out in the desert makes it. 
 A little rich for my blood but it trades like hotcakes. 
 That's a Chevelle. 
 I tell you what, you get that thing running there's a case of Beam in it for ya. 
 Hell, there's a case in it for you even if you don't. 
 Come on, let's get this party started. 
 Say yes. 
 Oh, I'll get it runnin'. 
 ♪ I can't believe you got the stereo working. 
 Whoo! 
 Oh, I love this goddamn apocalypse. 
 You sure know how to live, I'll give you that. 
 Yeah, well, you got a big fat truckload of nothing most of your life you learn exactly what you need is a whole bunch of everything. 
 Am I wrong about that? 
 You are not wrong. 
 Mmm. 
 So what'd you do before all this? 
 Car salesman? 
 Pet store manager? 
 Same as you. 
 Minded my own goddamn business. 
 Fair enough. Enough said. 
 Look, I've been everything you can think of and maybe some things you can't. 
 Is that so? 
 Mmmhmm. 
 You wanna know the one thing I learned in all that? 
 You can't let yourself get to where you are now. 
 Easy. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Listen, you gotta- this thing, you gotta shut all that sh1t out. 
 When I set it right. 
 There's someone who's gotta pay. 
 Hmm. 
 What, someone killed someone you think shouldn't have? 
 A whole bunch of someones? 
 You lose the wrong person at the wrong time? 
 Just one. 
 My apologies. 
 Absolutely right, though. 
 That is exactly my point. 
 Life is... sh1t. 
 You gotta rise above it. 
 Leave the inside crap to the bottom feeders. 
 Move on, you hear me? 
 Shut that sh1t out. 
 When it's done. 
 You are just a big ball of sunshine, aren't you? 
 Tangled up mess of a man. 
 Mmm, this is áááá life! 
 This is áááá life! 
 C'est la vie! 
 Huh?

 ♪ 
 Ahhh!!! 
 Dispatch, transport bus is clear. 
 10-4. Get back to your post. 
 Come on. 
 Anything? 
 She's here. 
 Let's go. 
 Let's get her. 
 Now? 
 Shh! 
 You're safe. You're safe. 
 We're here to help you. 
 Your name's Jennifer, right? 
 I'm Jolene. 
 We're gonna get you out of here, alright? 
 Help! Help! 
 Help me! 
 Shh... Shh... 
 [gasps] Phil. 
 Stay right there! 
 Put your hands up where I can see 'em. 
 Please, please, plea- please don't shoot. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 -Oh my god. -What? 
 You're the one who shot me. 
 [thud] 
 [gun shot] 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Stand down, soldier. 
 Stand down. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Don't you ever sleep? 
 I sleep fine, thanks. 
 What the hell's going on out here? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 Just a little skeet shooting. 
 As you can see I make my own pigeons. 
 That's a hell of a hobby. 
 Yeah. 
 Your turn. 
 [gun shot] 
 Nice shot. 
 You got a great eye. 
 That's a nice little rig you got there, too, if you don't mind me saying. 
 Thanks, I guess. 
 I got a deal that I think might interest you. 
 I doubt it. 
 All I got ahead of me is the road. 
 Look, we've all had a... well, it's been a hell of a rough time out there the last couple years. I get it. 
 I think I heard this speech last night. 
 Alright. 
 Oh, you uh, partake? 
 What is that? 
 Solicite. 
 It's supposed to, uh, ward off vampires but it's got a nice kick to it. 
 A bit of a, uh, rough edge... 
 [sniffs] 
 Snaps your brain into a nice sweet spot though if you get the, uh, take right. 
 Help you sleep? 
 Absolutely not. 
 I'll pass. 
 Last thing I need is more waking hours in this bullshit. 
 Well, then you should take my deal. 
 Could use a guy like you out there ferrying booze and sh1t. 
 Be your own man. 
 áááá everybody else. 
 Just you looking out for you, all the booze you can skim. 
 Sounds pretty nice, doesn't it? 
 Maybe. 
 I'll take that as a yes. 
 Ready! 
 [gun shot] 
 [gun shot] 
 Ya-ya-ya-ya-yeow! 
 [laughs] 
 sh1t. 
 I thought you were dead. 
 Look, I'd like to apologize for shooting you and if it means anything I aimed for your vest, alright? 
 So thanks? 
 You got a hard head, I'll give you that. 
 You have no idea. 
 No, I don't, actually. 
 Like why did you shoot me to get into this hell hole, then kill a bus driver to escape? 
 No, I didn't kill anyone. 
 Then end up breaking in here, anyway. 
 To find your wife, right? 
 That Jennifer lady. 
 Please. 
 Let's leave her out of this, alright? 
 Oh, now you're asking for favours? 
 You are something else. 
 I'm asking you to please forget you know anything about her, alright? 
 Well, if I don't I'll probably end up dead, too. 
 And now what happened to my friend, Jolene? 
 I'm supposed to keep you two separated till he gets back. 
 Why? Who's "he"? 
 Oh, you'll find out soon enough. 
 Don't talk to me. 
 Okay. 
 This is just my job. 
 They'll kill us too if they find out why you're here. 
 They're not gonna kill me. 
 I'll figure a way out of this. 
 You have no idea what I've done to survive here. 
 I have done everything right and now you- 
 He risked everything to come here and save you. 
 I told you to shut your mouth. 
 And I know what he did to you and your children. 
 Don't you dare. 
 I hope they're torturing him in there. 
 I'd kill him myself if I could. 
 What he did, it wasn't his fault. 
 You don't know what you're talking about. 
 You have no idea. 
 It's like a fortress. 
 It used to be some kind of bank or money counting place, I think. 
 Money? 
 That's useful. 
 It's not the money we're after, it's the food. 
 There's a cafeteria or restaurant on the top floor. 
 We can see it from beside the building. 
 I don't think anyone's been able to get up there yet so it should be fully stocked. 
 Chad found a door he thinks he can get through months ago. 
 So why didn't you break in then? 
 Things went sideways. 
 I barely got my lookout out of there alive. 
 I can't imagine being a kid through all this. 
 Hey. 
 I'll be back before you know it. 
 That's what Mike said. 
 And everyone else. 
 Well, I'm not everyone else, am I? 
 And you have Monica to take care of you. 
 You never left me before. 
 I always used to go with you. 
 Well, look how that turned out. 
 I have people to help me take care of you now. 
 I just want you to be safe. 
 You're ditching me, aren't you? 
 No. 
 Tabby, I would never ditch you. 
 It was Mike's, right? 
 I would never leave without that. 
 So you know I'll be back. 
 Okay? 
 Ready? 
 All set. 
 We cut back towards my old garage and keep going. 
 We'll be back before dark. 
 I'll leave the light on. 
 If I can get the genny working. 
 [cocks gun] 
 I am gonna go check on the fuel brewing in the kitchen. 
 Okay. 
 Awesome. 
 Hold still. 
 What's going on? What're you doing? 
 You don't wanna know. 
 The Warden is coming. 
 Please, just keep my wife out of this- 
 I'm not promising sh1t. 
 You have no idea what this guy is capable of. 
 Oh, you go away for a couple days, all hell breaks loose. 
 Morning, Warden. 
 Is that what it is? 
 What was your name again? 
 Jeremy. 
 Jeremy. 
 Jeremy, this guy shot you once, right? 
 Is that what the boys are telling me? 
 Yes, sir. 
 [Max] Do you have any idea why he's here? 
 [Jeremy] No, sir. 
 What about you? 
 You want to fill me in as to why you and well, whatever her name is broke into a prison? 
 No? 
 Oh, good. 
 I love it when they're quiet. 
 Mysteries are like my favourite thing. 
 He knows. 
 But let me get this straight. 
 You uh, you shot a cop to get in here, escaped on the way, and then uh, broke back in. 
 Wow. 
 Must be a hell of a story. 
 Hey Jer? 
 You wouldn't happen to have a light, would you? 
 You don't mind, do you? 
 Some assholes hate the smell of them, but you're not one of those assholes, are you? 
 God, you've got some beautiful eyes. 
 Did anyone ever tell you that? 
 No, we should probably go slow, though. 
 No rush, right? 
 Plenty of time to, uh, pry that story out. 
 [cries out] Ahhhhh!!!! 
 Ohh-wee! 
 I love the sound of ribs cracking, it's like- it's like bubble wrap to me. 
 You hear that? 
 Ahhhhhh!!!!! 
 You got a problem, Jer? 
 I'm good. 
 You don't look good. 
 Better than him but... 
 Oh, no don't tell me you don't have the stomach for this sort of thing. 
 I don't have the stomach for the liver they dished out at breakfast. 
 [laughs] 
 You're gonna lose your lunch, is that it? 
 It's the other end that's the problem. 
 Woo! 
 I like him. 
 I like you, this guy's a riot. 
 Don't worry, Jer. 
 I know how to get him to talk. 
 Let's get some fresh air. 
 What're you looking at? 
 Get back to work before I ship you out east. 
 Geez. 
 Morning. 
 I trust you've been having a nice day so far, a lot of time to think things over. 
 You must be the boss around here. 
 Sharp as a tack. 
 I like that in a woman. 
 You must like a lot of women then. 
 Jeremy. 
 You put him right here. 
 That would be wonderful. 
 Did you know this guy before he shot the cop? 
 Something going on between you two? 
 Not my type. 
 Hmm. 
 What about you, Jer? 
 Do you know her? 
 No. 
 I don't know either of them. 
 Really? 
 'Cause I'm kinda thinking we've got a bit of a love triangle situation going on here. 
 Correct me if I'm wrong. 
 You stole her from him and you just lost your sh1t, didn't you? 
 Shot him, followed him, then you came here for both of them? 
 Not even close. 
 Oh. 
 Well then, please, do enlighten me. 
 You wouldn't believe me if I did. 
 Well I already told your friend over there I love mysteries. 
 But there is a limit, isn't there? 
 I mean, they can just get so goddamn... annoying. 
 [gun shot] 
 You know what? 
 I'm tired of all this. 
 Shoot her, too. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Don't, please. 
 I have to. 
 No, you don't wanna do this. 
 You need me! 
 Denver sent us! 
 Denver? 
 As in Blak Tek? 
 Yeah. 
 Why? 
 What for? 
 To spy on you. 
 They promised us if- if we reported on you we'd get a lighter sentence. 
 Why should I believe this story? 
 Because it's true. 
 They told me they thought you were skimming off the top, trading supplies, prisoners, too. 
 So, are ya? 
 [groaning] Ahhh!!! 
 [groaning] 
 Well, well, well. 
 More surprises. 
 You know what, Jeremy? 
 Bring her to my office, chain him up. 
 I want to keep them both until I figure out what the hell's going on. 
 First, I must use the little girl's room. 
 He's a áááá psycho. 
 This lock kit was just sitting there in the garage. 
 I practised but... 
 They make that look a lot easier on TV, huh? 
 God, I miss TV. 
 Keep a look, there's always a ton of them roaming around out here. 
 We've gotta get in and out. 
 Oh, crap! 
 Let me try. 
 Be my guest. 
 Chad! 
 Chad! 
 Have you seen Tabby? 
 I think she took off after you! 
 What? 
 
 
 
 sh1t. 
 Hey! 
 Watch out! 
 [firing] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 Take his head! 
 [firing] 
 sh1t. 
 [screaming] 
 [gun shot] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [gun shots] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [explosion] 
 Chad! 
 Tabby! 
 Tabby, no! 
 Oh, Tabby, oh god. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [screams] 
 No! 
 No! 
 Oh sh1t! 
 sh1t! 
 Oh my god, Jack! 
 Oh. 
 [sobbing] I can't become one of those monsters. 
 No. 
 I need you to kill me. 
 No. 
 No, no, I can't. 
 Hurry. 
 There's another way. 
 There's another way, Jack. 
 Listen to me. 
 No, Jack, listen to me. 
 Fine! 
 -I'll do it myself! -Oh, my god! 
 What? 
 No!!! 
 Jack, what did you do? 
 sh1t. 
 Oh, my god! 
 Why? 
 Why Jack? 
 Oh, my god! 
 Jack! 
 [sobbing] 
 We have to be sure. 
 It's what she'd want. 
 [fire crackling] 
 How many bodies did you throw in the dumpster? 
 Four. 
 Including Jack? 
 Yeah. 
 Why? 
 [cocks gun] 
 One of the daywalkers is still alive. 
 Please help me. 
 What the...? 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 What is that? 
 I'll do it. 
 Monica, wait. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Wait. 
 What're you doing? 
 Please... 
 Help... 
 Oh my god. 
 Help me. 
 Jack. 
 [coughing] 
 Maybe he forgot about me. 
 I told you not to talk. 
 He's just making you wait so it's worse. 
 You don't seem to like your new job. 
 [laughs] 
 Your friend totally screwed me. 
 I had it good in Denver. 
 I had a job, I was safe. 
 But they told me I should have drew my weapon first. 
 Hmm. 
 Now the Warden's suspicious you know something. 
 Phil shot you then you're the one that catches us sneaking in? 
 I told you to shut up. 
 And you couldn't shoot me out there. 
 He saw that, too. 
 If he finds out that I've been talking to you, I'm dead. 
 You're dead anyway. 
 It doesn't matter what's true. 
 He suspects you, you're a dead man walking. 
 You need to get out of here as much as we do. 
 Blak Tek didn't send you. 
 That's bullshit, right? 
 Impossible to know. 
 That's the beauty of it. 
 You know, you're smart, but you don't know everything. 
 Yeah? 
 Like what? 
 There was a rumour Denver fell. 
 What do you mean, fell? 
 That everyone is dead and gone. 
 Sarah. 
 No one's told the Warden. 
 We don't know if it's true. 
 Right, and he's the type of person who shoots the messenger. 
 Right. 
 I won't say anything. 
 I'm sorry if he makes me kill you. 
 I don't have a choice. 
 [Max] Honey, I'm home! 
 Sorry, I'm late. 
 I had to go down to the mines, rattle a couple cages. 
 You want a drink? 
 Sure. 
 Whatever's going. 
 Okay. 
 Jer, get Denver on the radio. 
 Tell them I want to speak to Maddox. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [radio static] 
 So tell me, your little friend outside, is he some sort of Blak Tek experiment? 
 Yeah, that's what they told me. 
 Who's your source over there, anyway? 
 Some woman. 
 Said her name was Caitlin Bruce. 
 [phone rings] 
 [Jeremy] Warden's office. 
 Okay. 
 New shipment's at the gate from Fort Collins. 
 You reach Denver? 
 Uh, no. 
 Nothing. 
 There might be something wrong with the radio. 
 It's just static. 
 Hello. 
 They don't know anything yet. 
 They don't know about stealing the food, selling it. 
 Or shipping prisoners east. 
 They said they'd contact me. 
 I could still get you out of this, but not if I'm dead. 
 Put her to work in the mines. 
 Gotta make sure everything looks normal, right? 
 While you're at it get me someone to fix that goddamn radio. 
 Yes, sir. 
 What about the other guy? 
 The experiment? 
 Oh, he stays where he is. 
 Mm. 
 I wanna see how much he can take. 
 What the hell do we got here? 
 I was about to ask you the same question. 
 What's with taking all my weapons at the gate? 
 Nobody carries in here except for me and the guards. 
 Best practise in a prison, you know? 
 You run this place? 
 It's just a little sideline. 
 You got my bourbon? 
 No, all they had was this bathtub bullshit. 
 So what's all this then? 
 Everything else you ordered. 
 Guns, ammo. 
 Is the radio really broken? 
 How should I know? 
 You better figure out which side of this you're on. 
 I don't decide anything. 
 We're running out of time. 
 How long do you think I can tap dance before he just kills us all? 
 Holy sh1t! 
 What? 
 Uh, don't look. 
 What? 
 Yell at me. Yell at me right now and shove me to the ground. 
 Let go! 
 Let go of me! 
 I said get moving! 
 Get your áááá hands off me! 
 Let's go! 
 Let's go! Come on! 
 Looks good. 
 I want my whisky though. 
 The real stuff. 
 I mean, life sucks enough as it is, right? 
 Sober? 
 Hm. 
 áááá me. 
 Here. 
 Take this, drive through the night, you can be back by morning. 
 Axel. 
 See you in the morning. 
 Atta boy. 
 Come on. 
 What was that about? 
 Nothing, apparently. 
 [gasps] 
 [cries of pain] 
 Hey. 
 Hey, wait up there. 
 Hey. 
 What happened to me? 
 You don't remember? 
 I was bit. 
 And then... I was on fire, and... oh god. What if- 
 No. 
 No, no, no. Stay calm. 
 Hey, you're not one of them. 
 Okay? 
 You're not. 
 Then what am I? 
 I don't have all the answers, but the vampire that bit you, she's human again. 
 How is that possible? 
 All I know is Vanessa could do the same thing you did. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Tabby, she got bit, too. 
 She was turned. 
 But Vanessa turned her back. 
 That's how I know for sure. 
 What's wrong? 
 It's nothing. 
 Does it hurt? 
 I don't know. 
 It's... like a pull. 
 Like I need to go find her. 
 What are you- what are you talking about? 
 Find her where? 
 I don't know, I... 
 Just give yourself time to fully heal. 
 No, Chad. I gotta go find her now. 
 Chad... 
 Please. 
 You sure this is what you wanna do? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, no. 
 But I know I've gotta go. 
 Say bye to Tabby for me, and everyone else. 
 Okay. 
 You saved her life, you know. 
 Tabby's. 
 So you saved mine, too. 
 You would have done the same. 
 Um... you know, I don't know how to say this but... 
 I think you might be part of the answer to all of this. 
 You're part of the way out. 
 I have to go. 
 Yeah. 
 Um... 
 Here. Okay. 
 That's good, yeah. 
 I hope you find her. 
 I will. 
 I have to.
