 Previously on "Van Helsing"... 
 What the hell was that? 
 It's other people, people we can make contact with. 
 Who's there? 
 Where do you even live? 
 You want to see? 
 Jesus Christ, Sam. 
 I think we just got our lives back. 
 We got company. 
 [gunfire] 
 I'm going to help Doc look for this Gorman idiot again. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [gasps] 
 [sobbing] 
 [shouting] Open the door! 
 [sobbing] I'm sorry! 
 [screams] 
 [crows cawing] 
 [growling] 
 Hey, nap time's over. 
 [gasps] 
 We gotta go. 
 We gotta move. 
 [hissing] 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 Here we go! 
 Back to back! 
 Alright, I got this. 
 [gun shots] 
 Don't be an easy target! 
 [gun fire] 
 I'm down to my last clip! 
 Me too! 
 We fight or die. 
 Okay. 
 [gun fire continues] 
 [screaming] 
 [snarling and growling] 
 [screaming] 
 [snarling and growling] 
 Bad spot for a camp-out. 
 Couldn't find a motel. 
 More ferals will come. 
 Time to go. 
 Go where? 
 Eden. 
 [crows cawing] 
 Food, medicine... you'll be safe. 
 Yeah, heard that one before. 
 What, you trust him? 
 Don't you? 
 Everyone we meet lets us down. 
 John, Gorman... why should this one be any different? 
 Psychotherapy? 
 Oh, hell no. 
 Whatever it was, it's home now. 
 It's like a dream. 
 Thank God, you're safe. 
 Welcome to Eden. 
 My name is Mica. 
 Thanks. 
 Is this place real? 
 We are lucky to have found you in the woods. 
 Beth, water. 
 For our guests. 
 What were you doing out there... in the woods? 
 We were heading south. 
 Kept running into one bad situation after another. 
 Best you move on then. 
 Don't want your troubles at our door. 
 Beth. 
 [bells toll] 
 See what they've done? 
 Emma. 
 Take our visitors inside, please. 
 And Peggy, quickly now, quickly. 
 Follow me. 
 Please. 
 See? No safe place. 
 [bell continues to toll] 
 Go upstairs and hide. 
 Magdalene. 
 You're three days early. 
 A problem? 
 No. No, we can give you half right now. 
 Xavier? 
 Please. 
 I passed dead ferals in the woods. 
 Hunting them for sport now? 
 If we don't, they hunt us. 
 [sniffs] 
 Something wrong? 
 I'm told there are humans. 
 From the city. Fugitives. 
 One of them is special. 
 A woman. 
 You will tell me what you know. 
 I know nothing. 
 Is that so? 
 Magda. 
 After all this time. 
 Why would I lie now? 
 Mmmm. 
 Find this woman. 
 Inform me. 
 Tell me, what does Julius want with this woman? 
 I honour our deal, Mica. 
 Question me? 
 Defy me? 
 And all this ends. 
 So.... you cut a deal with one of them. 
 Well, it just makes sense. 
 Instead of being murdered or enslaved, I've found a way for us to co-exist. 
 A deal with the devil. 
 It's an accord. 
 It's an accord. 
 Twice a month... we supply Magdalene with fresh blood and she ensures that her kind... will leave us in peace. 
 And you trust her? 
 I have no reason not to. 
 It's hard to believe. 
 Yes. I prefer to think of it as... an elegant solution to a terrible problem. 
 You must be the woman Julius is seeking. 
 I don't know anything about that. 
 I'm searching for my daughter. 
 We killed a lot of Julius's vampires. 
 I'm guessing he wants revenge. 
 Magdalene said you were special. 
 Just lucky. 
 I'm still alive and... a bunch of our people aren't. 
 This place feels too good to be true. 
 I was a skeptic at first, but inside these walls we're free from the horrors out there. 
 Or just hiding from reality. 
 I had a friend who felt like you. 
 Walls and barricades meant safety, but... eventually the real world comes crashing in. 
 If there's a better alternative, I've never found it. 
 I know what it's like to run. 
 Scared. 
 But then I found this place. 
 So you follow Mica now? 
 Like I found religion or something? 
 It's not like that. 
 Then what? 
 I'd tell you if you were staying, but... it sounds like you're moving on, so... 
 Women's dorms are this way. 
 I'll take it from here, Zorro. 
 Thanks. 
 [locks door] 
 [cries out] 
 Curiosity killed the cat. 
 So, today the day we move on? 
 What's up, Sue? 
 It's not me, it's this place. 
 I barely slept last night. 
 I actually dreamt. 
 The first time in forever. 
 Seriously? 
 Blood pact with the vampires? 
 Bare-chested swordsman? 
 It's like Cuckoo's Nest meets Camelot. 
 It's weird. 
 What? 
 All these pregnant bellies and yet there's no kids. 
 Doesn't that strike you as odd? 
 [screaming in pain] 
 I can't stop the bleeding. 
 What's happening? 
 She's hemorrhaging. 
 You're gonna need to do a c-section. 
 You're the doctor. 
 [stuttering] I-I... 
 I have a surgical kit. 
 Slow down. 
 I'm not a surgeon. 
 Listen to me. 
 If you don't cut into her, the baby dies. 
 Maybe both of them. 
 [cries out in pain] 
 Vanessa, keep on talking to her. 
 Ok. 
 Ok, Peggy, Peggy, listen. 
 It's all gonna work out, ok? 
 It's gonna be ok. 
 You can do this. 
 No, I just wanna go. 
 You can't. 
 Ok? Just breathe. 
 You don't know... the pain. 
 I do, honey, I promise you I do. 
 Beth, pull up on the abdominal wall more. 
 Like that. 
 Rupturing the membrane. 
 Ok, here we go. Here we go. 
 Take a deep breath. 
 Take a deep breath. 
 Good job. 
 [groaning] 
 Here we go. 
 [groaning] 
 Here it comes. Ok. 
 Baby's out! Baby's out. 
 Give it to me. 
 You did it. 
 [baby cries] 
 I'm cutting the cord. 
 [baby cries] 
 You did it. 
 [baby cries] 
 Ok. Ok. 
 How is the baby? 
 Shhh. 
 It's a girl. 
 Is everything alright? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, Mica, there are no children here. 
 What's gonna happen to that baby? 
 The families will be reunited when the time is right. 
 The pregnant women who come here, they are the daughters of the resistance. 
 They are the wives and the partners of patriots still fighting the vampires and for them this is a safe haven. 
 So Peggy and the others didn't get knocked up by you. 
 This is not a cult. 
 We are doing our part to give the human race a future. 
 To give them a new generation of freedom fighters because they might be the ones to end this nightmare. 
 Magdalene doesn't know. 
 No. 
 So you can see how important all of this is. 
 Our motives are pure. 
 Hey. 
 You did good. 
 You saved a life. 
 Axel would have been proud. 
 No he wouldn't. 
 Doc, what happened down there? 
 [sighs] 
 I waited, and then when it was clear he couldn't make it I left. 
 That's all. 
 What do you mean "couldn't make it"? 
 It was Gorman. 
 He turned. He had a hold of Axel. 
 I had to let go. 
 I was scared! 
 Vanessa, what do you expect me to do? 
 Get bitten as well? 
 You shut the door on him didn't you? 
 You shut the door, and you left him to die. 
 He kept you alive. 
 He-he fed you with his own blood for months. 
 Vanessa, please. 
 You don't understand. 
 Vanessa, I did what I had to do! 
 We're leaving in the morning. 
 You can stay here or go wherever you want. I don't care. 
 This is where we say goodbye. 
 [sobbing] 
 How long have I... been like this? 
 The fever came on after you ate that bad mushroom. It's breaking now. Here. Drink. 
 I have to go... something important... 
 No. You rest until the doctor can see you. 
 The doctor? What doctor? 
 She's new. 
 Birthed a baby today. It was incredible. 
 But I... have to find my sister. 
 Sleep. I'll look after you. There's nowhere you need to go. The only way forward... is to let go of the pain. 
 I don't know how. 
 I can show you. 
 Yes. 
 So, first... place your hands on the table. Good. Now close your eyes. Close your eyes. And breathe. 
 [exhales] 
 Just breathe. And... let your thoughts take you back to that time... to that place. When your pain began. 
 
 
 
 Katana. 
 Choice of the Japanese Samurais for centuries. 
 Yeah that, or guys with mullets and Corvettes. 
 The good old days. 
 Let's see what you got. 
 Impressive. 
 Did you learn all this since the rising? 
 I was a high school Phys. Ed. teacher. 
 [laughs] 
 Yep. [laughs] 
 Taught fencing at the Y. 
 Never thought It'd actually have any practical value. 
 What about you? 
 Uh... I never really found my calling. 
 What about family? 
 A partner? 
 I had a girlfriend. 
 She left for work the morning of the rising. 
 The last time I ever saw her. 
 Tried her cell for days until the whole system shut down. 
 Didn't get a chance to say goodbye, you know? 
 Never let your emotions drop your guard. 
 Never underestimate your opponent. 
 [laughs] 
 What did you do to him? 
 Oh, I... I simply showed him a path. 
 Nothing more. 
 He's the one who took the steps. 
 That sounds like a lot of new age psychobabble bullshit to me. 
 What are you so afraid of? 
 Don't bother. I'm not buying. 
 So angry all the time. Angry, angry, angry. 
 You don't know the first thing about me. 
 Well, I know what you were. 
 Flesh told me. 
 Told me everything. His past... 
 Susan's... yours. 
 And then there's Vanessa. 
 With all of her... abilities. 
 Certainly I can see why she's being hunted. 
 What are you gonna do with that? 
 There can be a place for you here. 
 All of you. 
 I'm a friend. 
 Yeah, well, I don't need a friend. 
 And you sure as hell can't wash away my sins so we're done. 
 Well, in the end it's your choice. 
 You can embrace who you are or you can hang on to what you were. 
 Can't do both. 
 [pounding] 
 [pounding] 
 It's for my parents. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, it's ok. 
 I kept them safe after the rising. 
 Brought them here. 
 With all that we went through I thought the worst was behind us. 
 Dad had a heart attack about six months back. 
 Nothing anyone could do. 
 At least he passed quickly, you know, on his own terms. 
 Not theirs. 
 Mom died a month back. 
 Never got over his loss. 
 They were all I had left, and I couldn't save them. 
 You bit me. 
 I didn't mean to. 
 It just kind of happened. 
 Are you... one of them? 
 No. 
 Well, not entirely. 
 What does that mean? 
 [sighs] 
 I'm... 
 I have... abilities. 
 Ones I don't fully understand. 
 Vampires turn human. 
 Ferals die. 
 All with a bite. 
 That's why they're hunting you. 
 They're afraid of you. 
 It's a powerful gift. 
 Or a curse. 
 Depends. 
 You could be the difference. 
 Hope instead of fear. 
 A better future for that newborn baby. 
 That baby. 
 Where does Mica take them, Theo? 
 Beth takes them to a rendezvous point with the resistance. 
 Where are they based? 
 Last I heard they set up camp in Seattle. 
 Re-took the city a few months ago. 
 What? 
 You heard wrong. 
 Come on. 
 Sam? 
 [laughing] 
 How did you find me?! 
 Sam, no, no! Let him go, he's not a threat. He's not a threat. 
 He's not a threat. 
 What're you doing? 
 Sam! 
 [choking] 
 Let him go. 
 No. 
 Sam, please. Let him go! Sam! 
 [struggling] 
 Sam, let him go! Let him go! 
 [choking] 
 Sam! 
 Sam, no! 
 Oh my God! Sam, don't! 
 Sam, what have you done?! 
 Shhh... 
 Woah. 
 I'll take her. 
 Where are you going? 
 To fetch some water for the horse. 
 I'll be right back. 
 [horse whinnies] 
 [gasps] 
 Magdalene!! Back off! 
 Now. 
 Come closer. 
 I kill them both. 
 You kill them both I'll tear you apart. 
 These were promised to me. 
 Mica, our pact. 
 I didn't know. 
 Whatever sick deal he made? 
 It's over. 
 I go, they live. 
 Don't let her hurt my baby. 
 You're the one Julius wants. 
 What makes you special? 
 Why don't you come here and find out? 
 [baby cries] 
 Let her go. 
 Trust me. 
 Save the child. We'll deal with her later. 
 [baby cries] 
 What have you done?! She'll kill us all! 
 Start talking. 
 Hey, we gotta go before they discover what you did. 
 Ok. 
 Drop your weapons. 
 Drop them! 
 We offered you comfort. 
 We offered you safety. 
 This is how you repay us? 
 Look man, we just wanna leave. 
 I cared for you, Mohamad. 
 How could you do this? 
 Emma, this is my friend. 
 You murdered Xavier. 
 You butchered him. 
 Take them. 
 Hey, hey. Easy, easy. 
 What're you gonna do? 
 What I should have done... in the very beginning. 
 What do you think we should do? 
 Banish them. 
 Send them away from here. 
 Don't be blinded by friendship. 
 You need to learn to think like one of us. 
 It's alright, friend. 
 A decision has already been made. 
 The hell does that mean? 
 It means you are murderers, your friends are murderers. 
 Vanessa has taken Theo away. 
 Was this your plan all along? 
 What plan? We're just trying to survive. 
 What about you, Mica? 
 Huh? Is your whole deal survival? 
 You know, your blood pact with your wife. 
 Yeah, Sam told me what he found. 
 You know the vampire, Magdalene? 
 She actually used to work here. 
 They were married. 
 Some kind of sick, twisted deal you got going on, uh? 
 No, no, no. 
 I love Magdalene. It's true. 
 But she turned. 
 And when she turned she would have killed all of us so I did what I had to do for us. 
 Mohamad? 
 What the hell's going on here? 
 Take her. 
 They don't follow orders from you. 
 Neither do I. Not anymore. 
 We know what you've been doing, Mica. 
 It's done. 
 They were there. They saw, they know. 
 And I put a stop to it. 
 All of it. The babies for Magdalene? 
 What are you talking about? 
 The newborns don't go back to the resistance. 
 They're given to Magdalene. 
 For God knows what. 
 You have no idea the consequences. 
 You told us they were safe. 
 I protected you for nothing. 
 It was never nothing. 
 I gave you peace, I gave you comfort and safety, all this for a very small price to pay. 
 Small price? 
 Killing children? 
 You're a fine one to talk, friend. 
 This from the man who dreamed of killing his family before he turned. 
 Fantasized about it. 
 I told you that in confidence. 
 Yes, well your friends should know who you are. 
 You are a sick b*st*rd. 
 It's over. 
 Magdalene will come for you. 
 And she will kill you all. Except for you. 
 You she will trade in to Julius and life here will go back... 
 Ahh!!! 
 Mica! 
 I believed in you. 
 You're really gonna stay? 
 I gotta say, I'm surprised. 
 There was something good here once. 
 Mica betrayed it but I still believe in it. 
 He warned you, Magdalene's gonna send others. You're not safe. 
 I know. 
 Beth told me where to find her. 
 A shed down by the river. 
 We'll hunt her and destroy her before she can bring others. 
 I've still got a target on my back. 
 And my daughter's out there, so... 
 These people need me now more than ever. 
 You'll find your daughter, and then I'll find you. 
 No, you keep it. 
 [laughs] 
 I wish I had been wrong. 
 We gotta find somewhere. 
 I still know a place, I'll show you. 
 Woah, woah, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. 
 Where's Doc? 
 [gasps] 
 You came to kill me. 
 No. No. 
 To warn you. 
 Theo, he's on his way. 
 They want you dead. 
 Mica. 
 Murdered. 
 [cries out] 
 [gasps] 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 I used to be one of you. 
 Vanessa turned me. 
 But I wanna turn back. 
 I can help you escape. 
 But you have to help me first. 
 I was never meant to be human again. 
 Please. 
 I beg you. 
 [gasps] 
 Nothing's happening. 
 No. 
 What's wrong? 
 What's wrong? 
 [shrieks] 
 No, please! 
 Stay away from me! 
 Whatever you were. 
 Whatever you are, stay away or die! 
 [gasping] 
 Oh God. 
 Oh no. 
 [sobbing] 
 [screaming]
