 Previously: 
 Either she goes dark and kills us or I make the sacrifice. 
 -Think about the strength- -No! 
 -to do the right thing. 
 I think I am having a spiritual awakening. 
 I can't keep killing. 
 You come face to face with a daywalker, you do not hesitate! 
 You take their head! 
 No! 
 [sobbing] I am going to turn! 
 No, no, no. Move your hand, okay. 
 I need you to look at this. 
 Test it. 
 No! 
 Don't! 
 Does she know who she is? 
 Or shall I say whatshe is. 
 If I ever see you again, I will kill you. 
 You hear me Vanessa? 
 My sister's sacrifice won't be for nothing. 
 [birds chirping] 
 [crash] 
 [snarling] 
 [vomiting] 
 [loud screeching] 
 [coughing] 
 [panting] 
 [hissing and snarling] 
 I've made mistakes. 
 Caused so much damage. 
 [snarling] 
 But now I understand. 
 I was following the wrong path. 
 The path of darkness. 
 [snarling] 
 Now I know the way. 
 [snarls] 
 [growling] 
 My mind is clear. 
 I'm not going to kill. 
 Only salvage. 
 This is the way. 
 I am the light. 
 [snarling] 
 [feeding] 
 [snarling] 
 [feeding continues] 
 Hello? 
 [thunder rolls] 
 Who are you? 
 [thunder rolls] 
 [thunder rolls] 
 Hey, can you hear me? Wake up! 
 Hey, wake up! 
 Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah! 
 You saved us. 
 I don't know how, but you freed us from that nightmare. 
 We can't thank you enough. 
 You're a saviour. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 You're welcome. 
 Woah, what're you doing? 
 Coming with you. 
 Uh, ok. 
 Um... you're now immune to vampirism. 
 Your blood is actually repulsive to them so they won't even want to drink it. 
 But that doesn't mean you can't die. 
 Got it? 
 Look, there are others out there who could really use the help from people like you so go find them. 
 We will. 
 Ok. 
 Alright, ok. 
 Get up. 
 Up, up, up. 
 Go. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [groans] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [groans] 
 I'm getting so much faster. 
 Don't get cocky. 
 Speed doesn't mean squat if you get killed. 
 Am I tiring you out? 
 You wish. 
 These weird dreams keep messing up my sleep. 
 Where'd you score those? 
 Let's just say your old man doesn't pay his guys too well. 
 I got these off the guard at my door. 
 For a tube of toothpaste. 
 I think you need the toothpaste more. 
 Ha, ha. 
 Ready? 
 For what? 
 Woah! What're you doing? 
 I can't see. 
 That's the point. 
 Just playing out a hunch. 
 Where are you, Julius? 
 This is a little bit of a cliche, don't you think? 
 [cries out] 
 This is bullshit! 
 Concentrate. 
 You don't even know what you're capable of. 
 Where are you, Julius? 
 Focus. 
 See through the dark. 
 Yeah right. 
 [cries out] 
 [yelps in pain] 
 [yelps] 
 I told you I can't áááá see! 
 But there's so much you can do. 
 [groans] 
 I can see. 
 Good. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 How did you know I could do that? 
 I told you, that bite had changed you. 
 I've only ever seen two people who can do what you do. 
 Scarlett and Vanessa Van Helsing. 
 But I'm not a Van Helsing. 
 Then why do you heal like one? 
 Turn vampires human? 
 Tell me about your mother. 
 She died. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You think my mother was one? 
 Was she a Van Helsing? 
 I don't know, but Doc knows for sure. 
 Then we go to her. 
 Believe me, I tried. 
 Your dad's got her locked up in here and I can't get to her. 
 I can. 
 ♪ 
 Hey pal. 
 I'd appreciate you not defacing my property. 
 ...Ain't no coming back, you hear me?! 
 [crash] 
 Son of a bitch. 
 You spilled my drink. 
 This pipsqueak is talking out his ass! 
 Who gives a sh1t? 
 When my wife and kid were turned I had to kill them. 
 Now this piece of sh1t is saying some woman of the woods turned him back from being a vamp. 
 I ought to kick his ass! 
 Leave him alone. 
 Or what? 
 You really wanna find out? 
 Shut your mouth! 
 There ain't no coming back. 
 I think it's time you take your shipment and go. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 You're gonna tell me where she is. 
 [Sam] Knock, knock. 
 This is a holy place. 
 You are not welcome here. 
 You will die! 
 [roars] 
 You. 
 You're the one that spoke through me. 
 We come for her. 
 What do you want of me? 
 [laughs] 
 Not you. 
 Michaela. 
 We have sworn to protect our mother. 
 We will die first. 
 Don't tempt me. 
 Elder. 
 You have done your job well, sisters. 
 The fourth elder has been anointed and the time of the Dark One nears. 
 We are here to awaken Michaela, the great mother of the Sisterhood. 
 We have been waiting centuries for this. 
 Prepare the ritual. 
 We must be careful. 
 Michaela is powerful. 
 Ruthless. 
 She cannot be trusted. 
 I like her already. 
 Do not underestimate her. 
 Waking her from centuries in exile will come at a cost. 
 A cost to us, or to you? 
 We are ready for our mother. 
 Let us begin. 
 [Sisters chanting in Latin] 
 [speaking in Latin] 
 [speaking in Latin] 
 [speaking in Latin intensifies] 
 [speaking in Latin intensifies] 
 [hisses] 
 Mother. 
 Rise, Michaela. 
 Bathory. 
 [hiss] 
 Are you sure about this? 
 Follow my lead. 
 Sorry, ma'am. No one gets in. 
 Your father's orders. 
 We're just here to see a friend. 
 Not a chance. 
 Come on, Sid. 
 A quick in and out, I promise. 
 I got orders. 
 Orders, shmorders. 
 Is that the 20 pack? 
 Mmmhmm. 
 Come on, come on. 
 And to sweeten. 
 Five minutes. 
 Got it? 
 Thank you. 
 How is your friend supposed to help us in here? 
 I gave her a sample of your blood before she was locked up. 
 My blood? 
 It's ok. 
 I trust her. 
 I got a feeling whatever she found out is why she's in here. 
 Oh, look. This is it. 
 Oh no. 
 Where is she? 
 Not your concern. 
 Take my daughter to her quarters. 
 Dad, Julius didn't do anything wrong. 
 We'll talk about that later. 
 Where the hell is Doc? 
 Where troublemakers go to learn their place. 
 I swear to god, if you hurt her I will rip your- 
 You'll do nothing. 
 Violet's taken to you and you care for her and I see that. 
 It's what I hoped for. 
 But I can't have you filling her head with mythical stories and nonsense. 
 We both know who she really is. 
 What happened to my daughter? 
 Ask her. 
 I'm asking you. 
 Nothing. 
 Is that why my men found the bodies of two vampires in a dumpster? 
 What happened?! 
 They attacked us. 
 And we handled it. 
 Isn't that what you wanted? 
 You said we both knew who she is. 
 What'd you mean by that? 
 [laughs] 
 Come on. 
 Now look who's playing dumb. 
 Hmm. 
 [choking] 
 [door closes] 
 Can I come in, Vi? 
 It's not like I can stop you, anyway. 
 Alright, then I'll cut right to it. 
 What were you and Julius doing in the detention area? 
 He wanted to see his friend. 
 And you thought you could help him with that? 
 Well, why was she there in the first place? 
 You know, this whole Julius thing was a mistake. 
 I brought him in because I thought he'd make you stronger, but instead I hear about the two of you sneaking into Low Town, putting yourselves at risk. 
 It's not his fault. 
 Ever since the rising my primary goal is to protect you. 
 Keeping me locked in this compound. 
 Yes. 
 That's for my protection? 
 Yes! 
 Because I wasn't gonna let what happened to your sister happen to you! 
 You know what? 
 Yes, I've probably been a little... overprotective. 
 That's why I had you train, so you'd be ready. 
 Ready for what, exactly? 
 For anything. 
 For everything. 
 Look, I've made some mistakes and there are things that I wish had gone differently but you, Violet, I wish I could tell you how important you are to me. 
 Tell me about my parents. 
 What's that? 
 Tell me about my parents. 
 Oh, come on Violet. 
 I've told you that a thousand times. 
 Make it a thousand and one. 
 [laughs] 
 Ok. 
 They both had brilliant minds with this desire to make the world a better place. 
 We became such close friends. 
 So much so that they made me your guardian, just in case something terrible happened and it did. 
 After the accident the doctors did everything they could to save them. 
 I made them a promise. 
 That I would take care of you. 
 I failed with your sister. 
 I am not going to fail with you. 
 You trust me, right? 
 Good. 
 Something you wanna tell me? 
 No. 
 Ok. 
 I know you're there. 
 It doesn't have to be this way. 
 [gun shots] 
 Ain't no other way it can be. 
 Go on then. 
 I told you the next time I saw you I'd kill you. 
 Axel, listen. 
 [groans] 
 sh1t. 
 I don't want to hurt you, Axel. 
 A little late for that now, Sleeping Beauty. 
 Why hide now, huh? 
 What's the matter, you lose your edge? 
 What happened to that blood lust? 
 I've changed, Axel. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 The second you put that blade in her heart. 
 You're supposed to be the answer to all this, you know. 
 An end to all the misery and the pain. 
 I still can be. 
 How're you gonna do that? 
 You gonna bring her back? 
 Huh? 
 You gonna bring all of them back? 
 No, this is the way it's gotta be. 
 Killing me won't stop the pain. 
 Let's give it a shot. 
 [gun fire] 
 Can't hide from me forever. 
 Only one of us is gonna walk away from here. 
 [gun fire] 
 [gun fire] 
 [click] 
 You ready to talk? 
 Yeah, sure. Come on. 
 Let's talk. 
 I'm sorry, Axel. 
 Save it. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [groans] 
 You finished? 
 [panting] 
 You're gonna have to kill me. 
 I won't do that. 
 You're not the only one who lost her, Axel. 
 Lost her? You took her! 
 Scarlett knew the choice she was making. 
 Don't you say her name. 
 She thought she was making the right choice. 
 She was your sister. 
 You're supposed to protect her. 
 I tried. 
 I left her on that island for a reason. 
 
 
 
 She was never supposed to be in that maze! 
 You could have talked her out of it! 
 I tried, you know I did! 
 [fighting grunts] 
 I'm not gonna hurt you. 
 You kill everyone you get close to. 
 Why should I be any different? 
 [groans] 
 All I ever tried to do was to protect her. 
 To protect Dylan. 
 I've lost everything. 
 Yeah, well- 
 Including you! 
 The one person in this áááá up world that was supposed to have my back! 
 I've accepted the losses, and what it gave me was purpose. 
 [groans] 
 Axel! Axel! 
 [groans] 
 No, no, no! Don't do that! 
 [groaning] 
 Axel. 
 Another curse, thanks to you. 
 [grunting] 
 So this is it, huh? 
 How this all ends? 
 I guess so. 
 You're gonna cut off my head? 
 Killing me would be killing what she sacrificed herself for. 
 áááá you. 
 áááá you, too. 
 [sobbing] 
 You know, I can't ever really forgive you for her death. 
 You know that. 
 I do. 
 So what now? 
 Keep moving forward. 
 Find a purpose. 
 I can't come with you this time, you know that. 
 I need to do this on my own, anyway. 
 Destiny or fate, or whatever your crazy family calls it? 
 You really believe all that crap? 
 This is all some preordained plan? 
 I didn't used to. 
 Now it's all I have. 
 Well, I ain't gonna be destiny's pawn. 
 I'm gonna choose my own path. 
 Where does that take you? 
 Back to something I should have done right the first time. 
 So this is it? 
 This the end? 
 It doesn't have to be. 
 What's this? 
 If you ever need me, follow it. 
 You'll find me. 
 Vanessa, what I did- 
 I know. 
 Take care of yourself. 
 You too, Sleeping Beauty. 
 Since there's nobody here to card shark, you gonna tell me what you're doing here now? 
 Okay, so you remember how we always talked about getting out of here and finding that coyote? 
 Ah, the one that's supposed to get people to Hawaii? 
 Well, pipe dreams are better than no dreams, right? 
 [clink] 
 Mmm. 
 What if it wasn't just a pipe dream? 
 What do you mean? 
 I mean let's go. 
 Tonight, you know? 
 I need out, Lee. 
 Beyond these goddamn walls. 
 You have no idea what it's really like out there. 
 But we always talked about an escape. 
 An adventure. 
 Why? 
 What's going on? 
 [sighs] 
 I'm not who you think I am anymore, Lee. 
 Something's happened. 
 I've changed. 
 You've changed how? 
 I've been having these dreams. 
 A place, a woman. 
 It's like she's drawing me somewhere. 
 It's like she's- she's tugging at me. 
 I know it sounds crazy but I need to find her. 
 And I want you to come with me. 
 Uh... Violet, it's not that simple. 
 I can't just up and leave for some dreams you've been having. 
 Then I guess this is goodbye. 
 Wait, seriously? 
 Violet! 
 [weak cries] 
 Ivory, my sister. 
 How I've missed you. 
 And I you, mother. 
 Rise my child. 
 Where are the others? 
 This is all, mother. 
 This is all? 
 [slap] 
 I left you with an army and you are telling me this is all that is left? 
 I'm sorry, mother, but a lot has transpired since you- 
 Silence. 
 Hmm. 
 I knew I smelled something rotten. 
 We have no time for petty grudges. 
 Petty? 
 Your lies and deception had me locked away. 
 Over two centuries, mother. 
 I will relish placing your head upon a pike. 
 You should be thanking me. 
 Our kind was nearly hunted to extinction during your rest. 
 Oh. 
 I am in your debt, Bathory. 
 Oh, I like her. 
 Where is the Dark One? 
 Still exiled by the Van Helsing. 
 [laughs] 
 Of course. 
 You freed me because you need me. 
 Our beloved needs all of us. 
 Our beloved? 
 And who is this? 
 This is the fourth. 
 He is not worthy to breathe the same air as the Dark One. 
 [gasps] 
 [sing-songy] Sam I am. 
 You will learn to love me. 
 There is no measure to the depth of his darkness. 
 Or his stupidity. 
 You killed innocents for pleasure. 
 Is anyone truly innocent? 
 A creator of so much pain and anguish. 
 I've only just begun. 
 Oh... 
 The days of games are over. 
 The mouse is dead and love died at your hand. 
 Yes. I killed love to embrace the darkness. 
 You know less of darkness than you realize, but you will understand soon enough. 
 Wonderful. 
 You will do just fine. 
 Simply wonderful. 
 We leave tonight. 
 It is time to unite the brides. 
 [hysterical laughing] 
 Let's go. 
 Turn around, on your knees. 
 What's this? 
 You're being moved. 
 To where? 
 To none of your goddamn business, that's where. 
 Now turn around and get on your knees. 
 Sure. 
 [groans] 
 [gun fire] 
 Ahhhh!!! 
 Guess you haven't heard about me, have you? 
 [knocking] 
 Sir? 
 What is it? 
 There's a group at the gate requesting to see you. 
 What am I, the welcome committee? 
 You deal with it. 
 They say it's urgent. 
 Who are they? 
 Let them through. 
 I'll be right down. 
 ♪ Don't tell him I want to know. ♪ 
 ♪ Don't tell him I want to know. ♪ 
 ♪ Just ask if he's going to go.♪ 
 [Guard] You can go. Let them through. 
 ♪ ... to the dance on Saturday night.♪ 
 ♪ Please ask him...♪ 
 ♪ 
 What is it? 
 Nothing. 
 Vanessa. 
 Woah, woah, woah, woah! 
 Jack? 
 What's the matter? 
 How'd you find me? 
 I don't know how I found you but I- I needed to. 
 Is everyone ok? 
 Yeah, everyone's fine. 
 They're all good. 
 Something happened to me. 
 I've changed. 
 [gasps] 
 A daywalker bit me. 
 And now you heal. 
 Yeah. 
 And the one that bit me- 
 Is human again? 
 And ever since that happened I've had this feeling of something like... pulling me towards... well, I thought it was you, but- 
 You still feel it. 
 What does it mean? 
 Come with me. We'll figure it out together.
