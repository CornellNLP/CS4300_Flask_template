 I've seen you here before. 
 I don't think so. 
 I'm pretty good with faces. 
 Names I can't remember for sh1t but... faces. 
 (On television) The Mount Washburn eruption at three o'clock local time was unexpected but geologists say the Yellowstone  caldera is an active seismic region and these events are common every 100 years or so. 
 Current winds are expected to bring the ash cloud westward, disrupting some... 
 Vanessa. What do you know? 
 We live a couple blocks from each other. 
 Mind if I give you a call, maybe grab a drink? 
 Let's have it. 
 See you in a few weeks. 
 (Clears throat) 
 You didn't answer my question. 
 I know. 
 (On television) And the list continues to grow. We are receiving word that air quality advisories... 
 Ready? 
 Yep. 
 Look on the tv, mom. 
 What is it? 
 Volcano near Yellowstone Park. 
 That's great, honey. 
 Come on, we have an important dinner reservation, remember? 
 I know, I know, I'm coming. 
 How was the job interview? 
 (Sniffing) 
 (sirens in the distance) 
 (slurping) 
 (cries out) 
 (groaning in agony) 
 (vomiting) 
 (choking) 
 For centuries we have survived for one reason, and one reason only. The shadows have protected us. 
 He's late. 
 Have you seen the skies today? 
 (Speaks Romanian) 
 Our time is now. 
 (Speaking Romanian) 
 The mystery of existence is not merely in staying alive, but in finding something to live for. 
 A delivery, sir. 
 There it is, everything you asked for. 
 (Low growling) 
 I know... I know something happened. 
 I'm sick. 
 Something's the matter with me. 
 I- I've got some sort of... 
 You are human. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 That's not... 
 No. 
 A reversion I haven't seen this since... 
 No, no. 
 (Speaking Romanian) 
 Dmitri. 
 This must be stopped before it's too late. 
 Yeah, so... I should go. 
 (Speaking Romanian) 
 ♪ La la la. ♪ 
♪ La la la... ♪ 
 Ok, I drank some. 
 I was just getting my cut. 
 I've always done that, always! 
 ♪ La la la la... ♪ 
♪ Ia la la. ♪ 
♪ La. ♪ 
 (Singing softly in Romanian) 
 (Singing softly in Romanian) 
 Where's the rest of what you took? 
 This is gone. 
 No matter. 
 Where is it from? 
 (Stuttering) One of our usual spots. 
 Over by the university. 
 A... a clinic. 
 No, no, no. 
 I-I'm one of you guys... 
 No, please. 
 Please. 
 Balthazar. 
 Find the source. 
 Do what you must. 
 Dead or alive. 
 (Low growl) 
 Something is coming. 
 I know. 
 Honey, that volcano was 100 miles away in Wyoming. 
 But they said.. 
 Wait. I'm telling you, there's nothing to worry about. 
 Ok? What we should be discussing is your birthday and getting home for cake and presents. 
 I thought we couldn't afford presents this year. 
 Well, I just made some extra cash, so presents are back on the menu. 
 But since it's getting late I say we go home for cake first and then tomorrow I take you shopping and you pick out something nice for yourself. 
 Is that money from the job interview? 
 Yeah. 
 Kinda like a bonus. 
 Yeah, ok. 
 Well, I hope you get this job. 
 It really looks like black snow. 
 Yeah, but it's not. 
 It's just ash from that volcano. 
 I know, but it's still pretty. 
 It's toxic. 
 Good point. 
 I wonder how long it's gonna be like this. 
 I don't know. 
 We should probably stay indoors for a few days, wait 'til the rain washes it away. 
 You think it's like this everywhere? 
 We can ask dad if it's like this in Denver when we call him tonight. 
 (Baby crying faintly) 
 (couple arguing) 
 Oh, come on, you're such a liar! Get out of my house! Oh, come on... 
 (slap) Hey Tommy. Stay here, Dylan. Mom, no! Mom, don't... Tommy! Mom, stop it! Find someone your own size to slap around, ass! Why don't you mind your own business? She's my friend. Yeah, well your friend needs to know when to keep her mouth shut! Vanessa? I got this. Oh, you got this, bitch? Mom! What'd you call me? Bitch. Mom! Stop it! Walk away, Tommy. No, you walk away. You like to hit women so much, why don't you make me? Mom, stop it! (Groans) Stop it, mom! (Groaning) You show your face in this building again and I'll put your head through that wall! Do you hear me? Ok, ok, girlfriend. You got this. You showed him. I'm gonna kill you, bitch! Mom, come on, let's go. Just go. You broke my goddamn nose! What I'm getting do? Sorry about what happened out there in the hallway. It's ok. I understand. It's a pretty sad-looking cake. Don't smile, I can see you want to. Do. Not. Smile. Don't do it, missy. Don't do it. Don't laugh! Noooo! I'm warning you, don't smile! (Giggling) Don't laugh, don't laugh! (Giggling) Hey, girl! (laughing) Don't laugh! Stop laughing! I'm not laughing! Stop it! (Phone ringing) That's your dad calling to wish you a happy birthday. Yes! Don't forget to get the flight info for your trip. Alright. Hi dad! Hey, happy birthday, kiddo! Thanks! Did you get the birthday present I shipped? No, I didn't. Sorry. You're gonna love it when it gets there, though. Maybe in a day or so. Yeah, sure. I can't wait to come see you this weekend! We're gonna have so much fun! Yeah, um... about that, honey... um... Is everything alright? Yeah, fine, fine. I just gotta straighten some things out. You know, it's just with the flights and the... the volcanic activity and... can you get your mom for me? Speaking of activity, who's purse is that on the table behind you? What's that? The purse! The pink one. Oh... I'll get mom. Honey... Gary, if you're ditching your daughter on her birthday for some random hook-up with a skank waitress... This has nothing to do with the weekend plans. It's a safety issue, Vanessa. Yeah, your safety, Gary. When I see you next I'm gonna kick your ass. (knocking) (insistent knocking) Coming! (Knocking) Coming. Hold your horses. Who's my personal saviour? How's your face, Susan? Forget about my face. This uh, is my way of saying "thank you". Does this make me your pimp? The job's available, comes with some good perks, too. Yeah, well I need the money. I wish you weren't joking sometimes. Come on, let's crack this thing open and get shit-faced. Look, I'd love to but it's Dylan's birthday. She just had a fight with her dad and I'm getting the cake ready. So after she goes to sleep I'll knock on your door, ok? We can deal with your wine surplus problem. Ok, sure. Choose your adorable daughter over a lush of a best friend. I'll see you later. Bye. Dylan, come on! (Oldies music plays) Dylan? You want some cake? 'Cause I can't eat this whole thing by myself. All right, will try. ♪ ♪ Dylan, I've decided it's cake time. Dylan? ♪♪ Dylan? Dylan? Dylan? Dylan? Come on, birthday girl. Candles are burnin'. ♪ ♪ Where are you? Dylan? ♪ ♪ Dyl? Come on, babe. ♪ ♪ Hmm. Where are you? ♪ ♪ Catch up. (Muffled thump) ♪ ♪ Hello? Who's there? Is that you, Tommy? Huh? (Low growl) What, you come back to get some more? (Growls) (growls) (dishes clatter) (intense snarling) Mom? (Wood splinters) (growling) (glass shatters) (fighting continues) Mom? (Groans) Mom? Where-mom, where are you? Dylan! (Growling) Mom! Mom! (Feeding) Mom! (Snarling) Mom! (Music continues) (vomiting) Mom? Oh my god, no! Momma! Dylan... Momma! (Sobbing) There's so much blood! Find Susan. Call the police then call your father. (Sobbing) Please... mom, no... please. I love you. I love you, mom. Please, mom, no! Mom. Mom! No, mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Wake up, please! No, mommy, you can't leave me! Please, no! No! (Sobbing) Hello, pretty. What's your name? Vanessa Seward, age 30, says the police report. It's a criminal file. I... This is a hospital. This DB should be at the coroner. Coroner's office is swamped and they can use the extra help. Swamped? Yeah, it's been busier than usual. With dead bodies? Uh-huh. What's "busier than usual"? I'm not supposed to talk about it. People acting crazy is all I know. Do you have a problem keeping her? No. Good. I'm done then. Help me with her. That's a new one. What is it? The lividity is unusual. The body isn't cooling, rigour hasn't set in. What does that mean? She's still alive? No, no. But it doesn't exactly mean she's dead, either. I need better toys. Move her to the fourth floor lab. What happened to you? Why aren't you dying in the usual way? (Sighs) Told this blood, but... but red the moons. What the...? Huh. Let's check your blood work. 
 
 Lieutenant. Hi Zara. Can I just bug you with a quick work question? Sure thing. I got this female DB. Early 30's, severe trauma with some unusual properties. Lividity, body temperature, it's all out of whack, and when I checked her blood it was acting like it was still alive. Alive? What do you mean? Mobility, cell activity, the works. Grace? What's going on? Nothing. We've just been doing several... nothing, forget it. Don't bullshit me. I know you too well. I'm not supposed to talk about it. You're the second person who has said that to me today. What's going on? There's an advisory from the Pentagon that's classified. Don't make me say any more. Jesus, Grace. I'm your sister! If there's something I should know... It's nothing to worry about. Promise. Look, just email me her numbers and anything else you can pull from the bloodwork. Sending it over right now. Don't leave me hanging. I'll deal with it. Don't do anything else, ok? And don't speak to anyone about this. I have to go. (On television) The US Geological Survey has advised us to pull back to a new safe zone. The interesting part is that it is much further away from the volcano. I have Miguel Rodriguez with us to help us understand why. Miguel? Thanks, David. Um, the reason we're asking everyone to pull back to a minimum safe distance is not because of the volcano that erupted yesterday. It's because the whole area is also a much larger super volcano, a caldera, that we worry might experience some unusual seismic activity due to the smaller volcano. You said "smaller"? That's correct. You see, the super volcano that we're standing above is actually 100 times larger than the one that you are filming currently. You the one that called in the zombie? Ex-excuse me? Called the base. Sent over data on a deceased individual you have on the premises. Grace. Then we're in the right place. Come with us, please. Can I finish my lunch? No, you cannot finish your lunch. This is a priority situation. It really can't wait, ma'am. What do you mean, "priority"? Just take us to the body. Not until you explain yourself. Can you please tell her to explain herself? There are reports of an unknown viral outbreak in some cities. That's all I'm permitted to say on the matter. A virus? That's right. But you don't have any protective gear. No biohazard suits. I don't have time for this. Sergeant. Help the doctor. (On television) Ok, sorry about that, folks. It appears that we have lost our signal from Yellowstone and I am getting reports of another eruption. Tell you what, we'll take a commercial break and try to get you more information on this developing story. We'll be right back. Yes, sir. Affirmative. Roger that, standing by. What's the latest, ma'am? Yellowstone went off big time. It's a goddamn crater now. Earthquakes in a 1000-mile radius. There are two nuclear plant meltdowns and the comms are being disrupted everywhere. National Guard and regular army have been deployed for rescue and recovery. It's a mess. Are we being deployed, major? Negative. What are we supposed to do? Well, the Pacific Northwest seems safe enough. The ash cloud from that volcano is probably gonna darken the skies for a little while... Shouldn't you people be focused on the emergency? These are specific orders, ma'am. Our buddies are dealing with the situation outside. Out. So what is the actual deal with Sleeping Beauty? She's dead. And not dead at the at the same time. Look, it just feels like this should wait. I mean, shouldn't the RA be outside... We're under orders, ma'am. I'm sure you are, but given everything that's happening right now... Don't question orders. This operation is being directed by the folks at the highest level. What does that even mean? The highest level means exactly what you think it means. I see. The advisory. What did you just say? The advisory. What's she talking about, major? She's talking out of her ass. Oh, so there isn't an advisory? That's classified. There's seriously something wrong with you, lady. Prep Sleeping Beauty for transport. No, no. Nobody's prepping anybody for anything! Our orders are to transport her back to base, Doc. (large explosion) What the...? (Gunfire outside) What the hell? Jesus. (Gunfire and screaming outside) Oh my god! (Gun shots) We need some help here! I need that bed! What do you want us to do, ma'am? Ma'am! Major! Base, do you copy? It's street warfare out there. Anyone! (Screaming) What the fu... (screaming) Hey, hey, hey! (Snarling) Ma'am, duck! (Gun shots) (screams) (gun shots) What the?! Does this have something to do with her? You know her? Did you see what she did to him? You mentioned the advisory. I don't know anything! (Radio): Blue on blue. Holy sh1t! What's a blue on blue? It means our guys are being attacked by fellow soldiers. Ted, keep your weapon on Sleeping Beauty. Copy that. Ok, ok. We gotta do something. We need reinforcements. About goddamn time. I'll take uh, Tucker and Kowalski. The rest of you remain here until further notice. I want Sleeping Beauty protected until we get a secure position and transport. Clear? Yeah. Copy. I'm just gonna go to my office. You're not leaving! You're remaining here as long as that body is here. You make sure she stays put. Ma'am. Don't worry, Doc. We're gonna keep you safe. Have you noticed the Doc hasn't been herself lately? No, I hadn't. Yeah, well, it's her birthday coming up. I thought maybe we could do something for her. That's nice. How do you remember this sh1t? I don't know, I just do. Hey, come on now, it's not like that. Really? (Alarm sounds) Where? Oh, sh1t. We lost the last GoPro. Hey, where are you goin'? I'm just gonna... take a walk through the halls. Won't be but a minute. You said that last time. Yeah, this time I'm telling you the truth. That'd be a nice change. I'm sorry that these experiments have been disappointing so far. But believe me, I have been trying with everything I can think of with the resources I have. I have high hopes for these latest pregnancies. But that's... What of the woman? What do you mean? Yes. The one with the abilities of some kind? She could be... very helpful. (Faint screaming outside) (speaking Romanian) I'm sorry, what? You can use her. Experiment on her. Yes. Yes, of course. Her existence could be the end of us. Or our future. Find her. Bring her. As you wish. Alive. If she exists, so want her alive. (Hisses) So what have you learned from him? (Gasping) Kill me... kill me! (Hisses) Well, we're officially down to DEFCON 2 level ammo rationing starting today. The biggest problem being bullets for the M4. Surprise, surprise. That's it. What's it? I can't do this anymore. Can't do what? What're you talking about? It's only a matter of time before we run out of supplies or some of those feeders get in here. So we get more supplies. There's tons of stores out there we haven't scavenged yet. Hey. We got a mission. I don't care how long it takes, I'm not abandoning my post until the CO tells me to. What mission? What mission? Sleeping Beauty! Doc says she thinks she could be the key to the whole thing. How are we gonna protect her if we're dead? (Sighs) We need a plan. Well, it sounds like you already got one. I do. Alright, well, bring it on. I take Smith and Gomez. Beat it back to the base. We'll recon with whatever weapons and ammo we can carry. Any comms left in this part of the world are gonna be there. We'll get you your orders so you can bug outta here. The base is 40 miles away. We can make it. Look, at least give me a couple weeks. I can see if I can get the rig... Oh, come on. Axel, it's a pipe dream. It's not gonna work. 40 miles! On foot! Might as well be 1000 with those things out there. You got a better idea? Axel, cover us from the roof. When the coast is clear give us the signal. What signal? You don't have to do this, Ted. Yeah, I do. If I stay here any longer I'm gonna take myself out. Doc, lock the door after we're gone, seal it tight. Happy to. (Can drops) Go time. Don't lock this door 'til we're clear. Mind your six. Go. ♪ ♪ (Growling) (gunfire) Oh, sh1t. (gunfire) (gasps) (snarling) Keep it open! What are you doing? What are you doing?! No! No! Doc! (Growling) (Doc screams) (cries out in agony) You ok? No! You ok? I've been bit! (Gasping) (growling outside) You're gonna be ok. I doubt it. (Gasping and sobbing) Where is it? Oh, my God. Oh, God. Okay. One... two... three... (groaning in pain) (sobbing) (wailing) No! No! (wailing) You're gonna shoot me, aren't you? You made me promise if you ever got bit, Doc. I don't want... I changed my mind. We made a pact. I know. Please, please. Please don't shoot... (cocks gun) (shrieks) Please, no, no! Please... (sobbing) Please... You don't have to do... (wailing) You don't have to do this... You don't have to... do this... No, I don't. Come here, come here, come here. (Gasping) I got ya. Come on, Doc. I got ya. I got ya. Stay with me. Listen to me. You saved both of us when you got that door shut, ok? You saved my life. (Gasping) It hurts... I know. I know. Just hang in there. Don't leave me. Hey, I ain't leaving. Please. I ain't going nowhere. There's gotta be a way to fix this thing, right? There's gotta be. We just don't know what it is yet, so I'm gonna keep you safe until we can figure it out. Axel... Doc. (Snarls) Jesus Christ. (Growling intensely) ♪ ♪ (Howls) ♪ ♪
