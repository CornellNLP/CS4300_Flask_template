 Previously on Van Helsing: 
 We need a Van Helsing to raise the Dark One. 
 I harvested everything I need. 
 An heir and a spare. 
 Two females... 
 Oh, my God! 
 Raising the Dark One is the answer to all of our problems. 
 So, when the time is right. 
 I don't remember requiring your permission, Michaela, or your presence. 
 The Dark One expects us to be there, Bathory. 
 I have this feeling like something is pulling me towards... who I thought it was you. 
 I also feel it. 
 We'll figure it out together. 
 To the rise of the Dark One. 
 [All] To the rise of the Dark One. 
 [crows cawing] 
 [Jack] Maybe we're distant relations or something. 
 [Vanessa] Maybe. 
 Probably, considering. 
 [Jack] We were adopted, anyway. 
 Dad never wanted to talk about it. 
 The kind of guy he was. 
 Didn't get along? 
 I don't know if he's still alive. 
 Maybe he's magically changed somehow, but once a corporate suit, always a suit. 
 I wish I did know more about my birth parents. 
 I guess one of them could have been a Van Helsing. 
 Maybe a grandparent. 
 What about your parents? 
 I'm not sure who my dad was. 
 I don't know if anyone knew. 
 I didn't meet my mom until the day she died. 
 What happened? 
 It's a long story. 
 Pretty sure we're on a long walk. 
 It's this way. 
 I was gonna say the exact same thing. 
 How'd you know? 
 A feeling. 
 Kind of a tug. 
 From here, right? 
 That's it. 
 Then for sure that way. 
 So tell me about your mom. 
 It's in there. 
 I can feel it. 
 Yeah. 
 The pull is getting stronger. 
 And a bit terrifying. 
 [thunder rolls] 
 Okay. 
 A lot terrifying now. 
 [thunder rolls] 
 This looks like the place where Abby died. 
 Also where I lost Scarlett. 
 You said neither of those places were real. 
 Or the same. 
 And yet both of them are really gone. 
 So this is it then? 
 This is where we're supposed to be? 
 Right here. 
 It feels like it is. 
 I sense it, too. 
 [gasps] 
 Oh no! 
 Vi! 
 Jack! 
 I'm so sorry! 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 I didn't mean to. I didn't know. 
 I just shot, I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 It's nice to see you still have a quick trigger. 
 'Kay, just sit still. 
 We gotta put pressure on it and stop the bleeding. 
 No, I got it. 
 No, don't touch it. Just let it- 
 Vi, what're you doing? 
 [heavy breathing] 
 You can do it, too. 
 Yeah. 
 You're her. 
 The one from the visions. 
 I've been having visions of you, too. 
 Somehow I knew I'd find you here. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Vanessa. 
 Vanessa Van Helsing. 
 I thought I left you behind. 
 We are bound. 
 You. 
 So full of potential and yet still so flawed. 
 [slap] 
 Are you trying to awaken my baser instincts? 
 [laughs] 
 Baby. 
 I don't fear them. 
 No. 
 I count on them. 
 Are you sure? 
 Dad's one of them. 
 I think he always was. 
 It just doesn't make sense. 
 I mean, him pretending he's human and saying that we're his adopted kids? 
 I don't think the people he said were our birth parents were really our parents at all. 
 I got a hold of some files. 
 Records of how we were born. 
 Dad made us. 
 Our fathers are random soldiers they used as donors. 
 Does that... does that mean we're even sisters? 
 Half, I think. 
 You thought you could do this alone? 
 The Van Helsing are close. 
 I can feel all of them. 
 Even if that were true, what then? 
 Recovery of the amulet and the death of them at my hands. 
 And then what? 
 I merge with the dark one. 
 No, not without the ritual. 
 A ritual you neither know nor understand. 
 In your blood lust you forget the most important part of your destiny. 
 Me. 
 You're wasting your time with the others. 
 They are two parts of this. 
 Two parts you said we didn't need. 
 Two parts you despise. 
 I'm not confused. 
 I took action while the three of you were bickering like children. 
 [gasps] 
 [whimpers] No!!! 
 [normal voice] You can't control me. 
 But I can still serve your purpose. 
 I was born in a research facility. 
 Me and my sister. 
 They engineered us. 
 They mixed our DNA. 
 Half human, half vampire. 
 What? 
 No. 
 I can't be one of those things. 
 Jack. 
 Hey, it's ok. 
 You said Hansen was a corporate suit. 
 Doesn't happen to be a Blak-Tek suit, does it? 
 They're involved in this. 
 Who knows? Maybe everything that's happened is because of them. 
 Our whole life is a lie. 
 Listen, if I've learned anything in all of this it's that you can't dwell on the past. 
 Okay? You guys have each other. 
 Cherish that. 
 Depend on it. 
 [thunder rolls] 
 She's right. 
 It's about us now. 
 Help me take the final step to become one with your beloved. 
 It is what we both want. 
 There will be no turning back. 
 It's all I desire now. 
 Don't keep it from me. 
 As you wish. 
 You need to keep watch. 
 While- while you do what? 
 You trust her? 
 Yeah. 
 Absolutely. 
 Good. 
 'Cause other than you I don't know who to trust anymore. 
 We'll figure this out. 
 This changing people back, the healing. 
 We'll figure it out together. 
 Hey! I need your help. 
 Look. 
 See the hand prints? 
 Yeah. 
 What are they for? 
 Well, in the past they've opened something. 
 But it only works for Van Helsings. 
 You ready to find out who you really are? 
 We're not going anywhere. 
 Okay. 
 Brace yourselves. 
 I think you should do it at the same time, okay? 
 Ready? 
 Three... two... one... 
 [struggling grunts] 
 Nothing's happening. 
 You call this nothing? 
 Give me your hands! 
 And light shall lead darkness to its end. 
 [thunder rolls] 
 [gasps] 
 It's alright. 
 It's alright. 
 It's day but now it's night. 
 How can that be? 
 This place isn't real. 
 It's more of a state of mind. 
 So those dreams where we- 
 No. They were real. 
 And we need to be careful. 
 The last time I was here I wasn't alone. 
 Where's Jack? 
 Jack?! 
 Stop. 
 I have to find her. 
 Jack! 
 [Soft Voice] Come! 
 Come to me. 
 Come to me. 
 Vi? 
 Come to me. Come to me. Come to me. 
 Jack?! 
 Jack?! 
 Jack! 
 Hey. Hey. 
 You need to calm down. 
 Okay? 
 Maybe she didn't make the trip. 
 I'm still unsure how all this works. 
 [Abraham] It's in the blood. 
 Has been for generations. 
 Stay close. 
 What is this place? 
 I don't know. 
 Don't move! 
 Jacob? 
 Jacob? 
 No, my dear. 
 I am not Jacob. 
 I'm his brother. 
 Abraham Van Helsing. 
 Come. 
 Come to me. 
 You've been warned. 
 Stay back. 
 Come. 
 I am no threat. 
 I used to be a threat. 
 The greatest threat a vampire had ever known. 
 But now you, and you, both fine, capable, our legacy and bloodline forever staying strong, I see, yes? 
 Yes. 
 What are your names, may I ask? 
 This is Violet and I'm Vanessa. 
 Vanessa. 
 Named after one of the finest Van Helsings I ever knew. 
 Now, you must have what I need. 
 Need for what? 
 To kill the Dark One, of course. 
 Entombed with me in the dark realm but still very much alive. 
 Dark One? 
 Tha... tha... that doesn't sound good. 
 Come now, you must have the means to destroy it. 
 Show me. 
 We have this. 
 And this. 
 You have not made a weapon to destroy it? 
 The family must have created a means to kill it after all these years. 
 The pages, they're gone! 
 But where? 
 Where? 
 The family was torn apart. 
 Our history was lost. 
 I don't know anything about a weapon or pages. 
 No. 
 All for nothing? 
 Centuries of loneliness and pain for nothing? 
 What happened to you? 
 How did you get here? 
 Our attempts to kill the Dark One had all failed and when my dear brother, Jacob, was turned I... 
 I knew what I had to do. 
 Without a weapon powerful enough to kill it I realized my best hope was to trap the Dark One in the realm of darkness. 
 I threw myself and it, the demon, through, severing all ties. 
 So you've been trapped in the dark realm with it? 
 Yes. 
 Come to me. 
 Yes. 
 Come to me. 
 Closer. 
 Come closer. See me. 
 Be one with me. 
 These are the means to open the portal to the dark realm, activated by our blood. 
 And under no circumstance must it be opened without the means to kill it once and for all. 
 I won't let that happen. 
 You must be very cautious, my dear. 
 The darkness has seduced more than one Van Helsing. 
 I can see this through. 
 I sense great darkness in you, Vanessa. 
 One that could put all humanity in grave danger. 
 And I pray it does not reside with the other. 
 What do you mean? 
 Yes. 
 Come to me. 
 No! 
 No! This cannot be! 
 What's happening? 
 The Dark One, it has been awoken. 
 Be one with me. 
 [choking] 
 No. No. 
 What have you not told me? 
 What?! 
 -Jack! -Jack! 
 Who is this? 
 Vi, Something happened! 
 Something terrible! 
 No. 
 What have you done? 
 Here. You must make a weapon. 
 Find the pages, open the portal. 
 Only then you can kill the Dark One, once and for all. 
 Now, go. 
 And take your children with you. 
 Go! 
 Jack? 
 What happened to you in there? 
 I don't know. 
 I ended up in this dark room and there was something and it was calling to me and I couldn't resist it. 
 It's okay. 
 We're out. 
 We have to do what he told us. 
 Fashion a weapon with no instructions. 
 What did Abraham mean when he said "your children"? 
 I don't know. 
 I mean, it's not possible. 
 Yes, it is. 
 We were created from eggs that were harvested from a four-year-old girl they were experimenting on. 
 It was you. 
 We came from you. 
 And that makes you... 
 Your mother. 
 [distant singing] 
 What the hell is that? 
 [distant singing] 
 Sam. 
 Could it be? 
 She's a Van Helsing, too. 
 Such a pretty family picture. 
 Stay behind me. 
 Hansen, with love, he said there was no other. 
 The other bride, so full of lies and deception. 
 Those are the vampires I saw with Dad. 
 Only way uglier now. 
 I need you both to get as far away from here as possible. 
 We're not leaving you. 
 Yeah, we can help. 
 Listen to me. 
 Your survival is the only thing that matters. 
 These two are mine. 
 Go! 
 [growls] 
 [snarling] 
 [thud] 
 Jack! 
 [fighting grunts] 
 Your fear is intoxicating. 
 But it's not your time to die. 
 Yet. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 Ahh!!! 
 I'll miss causing you such pain. 
 You'll never win. 
 You don't understand. 
 I already have. 
 [choking] 
 [laughing maniacally] 
 [laughing] 
 [snarling] 
 [snarling] Oh, doesn't it hurt? 
 [gasps] 
 I remember reading Frankenstein when I was just a boy. 
 The good doctor, he- he tried to make a creature just to see if he could. 
 Some people thought the creature was the villain. 
 And then, for others, he was a hero. 
 You're no hero. 
 I wasn't talking about me. 
 I meant you. 
 They made you, too. 
 An abomination. 
 A dark secret that was meant to fail. 
 Go to hell. 
 I plan to, right here. 
 On earth. 
 You've made that possible. 
 You and your offspring. 
 I'm here because of you. 
 Everything you've done, everything you are. 
 My ascendance is because of you. 
 It's of your making and I will revel in your destruction. 
 And theirs. 
 It is time. 
 Take the amulet from her. 
 [groans] 
 Suffer. 
 It's what you were made for. 
 My beloved would have preferred consuming you. 
 A pretty plaything. 
 Another Van Helsing seduced to our dark hearts. 
 But you've made your choice. 
 Does he know he's a pawn? 
 A sacrifice? 
 
 
 
 Clever girl. 
 But in the end I'm giving him a gift. 
 You're using him. 
 We all get used, each in our own way. 
 Surrender to that truth and all this will be so much easier to accept. 
 [speaking Latin] 
 [speaking Latin] 
 [speaking Latin] 
 It comes to this, my chosen. 
 Take the amulet, drink the blood of the Dark One. 
 Complete the pathway and open the portal. 
 Sam, listen to me. 
 You don't want to do this. 
 Think, Sam. Think. 
 Why you, huh? 
 You really believe you get to become the Dark One? 
 She offered the fourth elder to both of us. 
 Why? 
 So we could become stronger than she is? 
 Or so we can be sacrificed? 
 Do it. 
 Fulfil your destiny. 
 Maybe your destiny is your downfall. 
 My downfall was being born. 
 Pain and suffering of trying to be human. 
 Darkness that made inside of me could never be undone. 
 I must evolve. 
 Fulfil my final purpose. 
 Each step you took led you to this. 
 You are fully formed now. 
 And one with your darkness. 
 Ready to embrace your true purpose. 
 I feel it... 
 [gasps] 
 Coursing through me. 
 Yes. 
 Merging with me! 
 Ahhhhh!!!!!! 
 What? 
 is thi... thi... this? 
 The Dark One. 
 You have liberated her. 
 No, ah! 
 You. 
 Behold. 
 Yes. 
 Your master. 
 Wonderful. 
 [laughter] 
 [loud thud] 
 Dracula. 
 This world. 
 I sensed it's gathering evil. 
 The return to the black centre of its core. 
 But this is better than I thought. 
 More black than ever. 
 Purging itself of love and joy. 
 Hail Dracula. 
 Ruler of the darkness, commander of my soul. 
 Bathory. 
 My first and most enduring bride. 
 I am here, my beloved. 
 Here to worship the evil within you. 
 To bask in your darkness. 
 You are the one who raised me from my torment. 
 Yes. 
 Who created the fourth? 
 I discovered him as a child. 
 A seed of pure evil, nestled in his soul. 
 And you nurtured it, encouraged it to grow. 
 Yes. 
 To create a dark vessel. 
 An entranceway between this world and the void. 
 Yes. I did that for you. 
 Years of careful labour. 
 And so you come here alone. 
 Tell me, why did you not bring the others? 
 Shouldn't all of my wives be here to meet me? 
 Don't I deserve to feed on their devotion, as well? 
 The time of your return was unexpected. 
 The fourth acted rashly, without consent. 
 The fourth was your creation alone. 
 The fault must all be yours. 
 Am I wrong? 
 I swear I did not fail you. 
 The other brides are in waiting. 
 I woke Michaela. 
 Hansen is by her side. 
 They're ready to worship you for the goddess that you are. 
 Once again I tire of you, Bathory. 
 Years and years of your failed attempts to please me. 
 And you disappoint me yet again. 
 I have brought you a gift. 
 Look. 
 The last of the Van Helsings. 
 The only mortals capable of your destruction. 
 Hmm. 
 A Van Helsing. 
 And a powerful one, it seems. 
 And these two, her spawn? 
 Yes. 
 All strong and virile. 
 Prepare to feed your every desire. 
 Exquisite. 
 Fascinating. 
 And still I sense some of myself within you. 
 But how can that be? 
 I was made with your blood. 
 It is in me now. 
 Rooted at the core. 
 Yes. 
 The beauty of my essence flows within you. 
 Them, as well. 
 Don't touch them! 
 They're mine. 
 This one I will keep. 
 But the children, I wish to bathe in their blood. 
 To wash away the years of deprivation. 
 You will not. 
 What is this? 
 There's more of me in you than any Van Helsing, that I have ever known. 
 But you will still bow down. 
 It is your fate. 
 I bow to no one. 
 You dare to defy me? 
 To fire my anger. 
 No. 
 You misunderstand me, my master. 
 I wish to stand by your side, not bow at your feet. 
 What deception is this? 
 No deception. 
 Let me offer them to you as a show of my devotion. 
 Do not trust her. 
 The Van Helsings are treacherous. 
 Deadly. They- 
 Silence. 
 I will grant you this wish... 
 My curious new toy. 
 Spill the blood of your children so that I may cleanse myself. 
 [groans] 
 What's happening? 
 Vanessa? 
 What're you doing? 
 [gasps] 
 Run when you can. 
 Find the pages. 
 No. 
 Don't be afraid. 
 [gasps] 
 I could always feel the darkness in you. 
 It's in you, too. 
 Fight it. 
 [gasping] 
 I must have you as my newest bride. 
 No! 
 I am your one! 
 Your only! 
 If you had ever been enough for me there would be only you. 
 And just like my affection for you, this world's light must be extinguished. 
 Come. 
 Bask in my glory. 
 Fulfil your destiny. 
 Like Jacob before you. 
 Join by my side as we welcome the dawning of the eternal darkness. 
 As I unleash the power of hell to rule this world. 
 Come. 
 Take my hand, my newest concubine. 
 Become one with the darkness. 
 That's exactly what I had in mind. 
 Oh, you don't know how long I've waited for this moment. 
 [gasps] 
 Because you're right. 
 This is my destiny. 
 I long to be by your side, intertwined. 
 Together. 
 Forever. 
 There's just one thing you should know. 
 Nobody áááá with my family! 
 [cries out] 
 [Bathory sobbing] No! 
 No! No! 
 Vanessa? 
 Hey. 
 She sacrificed herself for us. 
 I need you to find the amulet. 
 Get the book. 
 Find those pages and go. 
 What're you doing? 
 You insolent children! 
 We're Van Helsings! 
 We're meant for sacrifice! 
 I can't leave you! 
 Come on, Jack! 
 I need you to go! 
 Now! 
 Go! 
 My beloved will rise again. 
 And when she does it will be through your blood! 
 Spawn of Abraham! 
 My mother's name is Vanessa. 
 [screaming] Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! 
 [Bathory] Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! 
 [bells tolling in the distance] 
 There's still hope.
