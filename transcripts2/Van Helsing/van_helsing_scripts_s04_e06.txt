 Does someone here take care of you? 
 Owen, get away from him. He could hurt you. 
 Is he ours? 
 Another bus full of prisoners. 
 Where's it headed? 
 Denver's the other way. 
 Out there is just desert. 
 Axel. 
 Come on. 
 Nothin' seems to kill you, does it? 
 [explosion] 
 Get away from him! 
 You, get in the car. 
 No! 
 Do what you said and find us. 
 You. You follow me, they both die. 
 He's going east, that's where all his trucks went. 
 I'm not stopping till I find 'em, you know that, right? 
 Damn straight. 
 We should have spotted her by now. 
 We will. 
 Maybe we missed the turn. 
 Maybe we lost them. 
 We didn't lose 'em. 
 This is the only road they can be on, alright? 
 They haven't turned off, or we would have seen their tracks if they had. 
 We'll find them. 
 Maybe I just have to face the fact that they're gone. 
 Hey, no. 
 She had a kid during all this sh1t. 
 She raised him, she protected him. 
 If I had to bet on anybody surviving this it'd be her. 
 Why did it take you so long to get us out of that place? 
 I'm gonna make it right. 
 I'm gonna find this prick and then I'm gonna kill him. 
 No, no, no. 
 That's for me. 
 If that's the way you want it. 
 I gotta make it right, too. 
 What is that? 
 Stop! 
 He's a smart kid. 
 He left this on purpose. 
 Max is smarter. 
 That feels like bait to me. 
 Why would he want us to follow him? 
 Look, it's the prison bus. 
 Well, they came through here, alright. 
 Those are Jeep tracks. 
 They're fresh. 
 The bus looks empty. 
 That's what I'm afraid of. 
 So what do you think? 
 He took the Jeep up the road and then doubled back around to pick us off? 
 There's only one way to find out. 
 You go left, I'll go right. 
 I got one dead guard over here, armed. 
 I got one over here, too. 
 You wanna hang here? 
 I'll check inside. 
 Nothing. 
 Nobody's home. 
 They're gone. 
 So it was an ambush. 
 Okay, so well, you think him and Max had them wait here for us? 
 Until the vampires got to them. 
 We're gonna have to keep our eye out for that, as well. 
 You know, I saw this bus leavingthe prison the day we broke in. 
 You sure? 
 Oh yeah. 
 It was filled with injured prisoners and old people. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 What? 
 What're you... what're you thinking? 
 Oh, Jesus Christ. 
 á*áá*á, come on, Axel! 
 Give me something here! 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 Listen, listen, listen. 
 á*áá*á! 
 He doesn't need them as a hostage anymore, right? 
 Jennifer or Owen. 
 Right? 
 They're just a pain in the ass at this point so if he knows we're after them why wouldn't he just drop them off on the side of the road? 
 Right. 
 We find them we- we stop chasing him. 
 Exactly. We're out of his hair for good. 
 So why set an ambush? 
 He's a... he's a psychopath, Axel, he doesn't think like you and I, alright? 
 He's a crazy person. 
 He may be crackers but he's not stupid. 
 If he's keeping them it's for a reason. 
 Why do you think? 
 Oh, I don't know, but... like these prisoners on the bus, it didn't matter if they were small or old or sick. 
 He's using Jennifer and the kidfor the same thing he was using these people for. 
 We're closing in on him, though. 
 These bodies are fresh. 
 Okay, I can't go through this again, Axel, alright? 
 We're not gonna lose 'em. 
 I'm not gonna go on like this, alright? 
 We're gonna find 'em! 
 This whole thing seems bad! 
 The whole á*áá*á thing seems- 
 Down! Down! 
 [gunshot] 
 That's a gunshot. 
 Shh! 
 It's them. 
 Phil's not ever gonna give up on us, you know that. 
 He broke into a prison to find us. 
 He let you do what you did- 
 Shut up. 
 Just let us go. 
 Then I'll stop bothering you andPhil won't blow your head off. 
 Oh, cute. Get back in the truck. 
 I have to pee. 
 Get back in the truck! 
 Bye, bye... 
 It's gonna be alright, okay? 
 We've always been fine in the end, we're gonna be fine this time, too. 
 We have to kill him. 
 Shhh. 
 Don't you cause any trouble, you hear me? 
 You do as I say, when I say, okay? 
 Heroes. 
 Pain in my goddamn ass. 
 [laughs] 
 Ah. 
 Move on over. You're driving. 
 Owen, put on your seatbelt. Right now. 
 Fast. Hurry up. 
 Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. 
 Come on, baby. 
 Hey. 
 You are gonna hang on super tight, okay? 
 [sniffing] 
 Where to? 
 Just keep driving straight till I tell you otherwise. 
 [sniffing] 
 Wait. 
 Why don't you get comfortable, little buddy? 
 There's no need for seatbeltswhen your mom is driving, right? 
 Do as he says, honey. 
 Nice try. 
 See up there? 
 What the hell is that? 
 A body. 
 Stop the truck. 
 Stop the truck! 
 It's not them! 
 Feeders, all of 'em. 
 They're not looking their best. 
 I guess the daywalkers haven't made it this far yet. 
 No, they're all burned to a crisp and put on display. 
 Someone's sending a message. 
 Yeah, it's a message for feedersfrom feeders. 
 Is that a guess? 
 No, Julius used to do this to mark our territory. 
 A warning to other kinds. 
 Other kinds? 
 [screeching in the distance] 
 That sounded awfully close. 
 [screeching] 
 Ho! Ho, ho. Ho. 
 Human! 
 Which is your toll? 
 Oh, he means us. 
 We have to pay our way in blood. 
 Which pays the price? 
 sh1t. 
 If he doesn't get one of us he's gonna take both. 
 That doesn't sound good. 
 Alright, look, we book it for the truck. 
 We get there, I got your six. 
 You're driving. 
 -Now? -Now. 
 Run! 
 Kill them! 
 [gunfire] 
 [snarling and screeching] 
 [gunshot] 
 Come on! 
 Come on. 
 [gunfire] 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 [gunfire] 
 [screeching] 
 [gunfire] 
 [gunfire] 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Son of a bitch! 
 sh1t, sh1t, sh1t! 
 Go full bore, buddy! 
 They're coming in hot! 
 [growling and snarling] 
 [gunshot] 
 Don't waste your bullets. 
 [gunshot] 
 [gunshot] 
 [gunshot] 
 [gunfire] 
 [gunshot] 
 [gunshot] 
 Careful with your ammo! 
 [gunfire] 
 [gunshot] 
 [struggling grunts] 
 [gunfire] 
 Axel! 
 Heads-up, buddy! 
 This is gonna leave a mark! 
 [explosion] 
 You were right about that husband of yours. 
 Persistent son of a bitch, butthat's a way bigger bomb than... 
 Woah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! 
 Easy, easy, easy. 
 Shoot me and say goodbye to your best friend. 
 Give it to me. 
 Drop the gun. 
 Okay. 
 Give me the drugs. 
 Owen, listen to me. 
 That man who helped us at the mine? 
 He's down in the valley. 
 I want you to run that way and keep running, you understand? 
 Go. 
 Now. 
 Come on, give me the drugs. 
 Give me the drugs! Now! 
 Not until he's safe. 
 Your husband's dead, sweetheart. 
 The kid's running to no one. 
 Phil can't die. 
 You know that better than me. 
 He certainly can if his head's burned right off, and judging by that explosion. 
 Wishful thinking. 
 Okay. 
 Maybe your husband made it. 
 Even so, it's getting dark, honey. 
 You have no idea what's waitingfor that kid in the dark. 
 There are things that have lived in these canyons for years. 
 Adapting, learning, figuring out ways to survive when there aren't any. 
 Feed off a lost survivors, trailer trash who try to live out here, little kids on the run. 
 You don't get a good meal very often, you know. 
 So maybe, you know, maybe they'll turn your little boy, but they'll probably just drink him dry. 
 Woah, hey. 
 He gets lost. 
 If he doesn't find your husband he finds his charred, decapitated remains. 
 Plenty of ways for him to die out there, all of them on you. 
 Owen, stop! 
 You know, you are very lucky that I need you alive. 
 Oh yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 [jar shatters] 
 Thanks for the tip. 
 You need me alive, right? 
 You said so yourself. 
 That means both of us, right? 
 What do you want us for, anyway? 
 Where are you taking us? 
 [screams in rage] 
 [ears ringing] 
 Hey. 
 Welcome back. 
 [groans] 
 What'd I miss? 
 The good news is the explosion killed the vamps. 
 Except for that first one, I think he slipped away. 
 Right. 
 And? 
 And I think I heard something up there just now. 
 What? 
 A woman yelling. 
 Where? 
 Up there. 
 It's close, I just- 
 I can't spot 'em. 
 They definitely saw that fireball, though. 
 Then he knows we're following him. 
 Or were. 
 We could use that to our advantage, maybe. 
 Look, if we head out now we can get there before dark. 
 No, I don't think so. 
 Rhonda's shot. 
 Both the gas tanks blew out. 
 Well, I mean, there's no- there's no way to get there on foot. 
 Their fuel's not gonna last forever, either. 
 We walk all night. 
 We'll find 'em. 
 You're willing to do that? 
 Of course. 
 We don't know what the hell's out there. 
 We might not make it through the night. 
 Death doesn't scare me anymore,man. 
 Life, on the other hand... 
 That belonged to Scarlett, right? 
 Vanessa's sister. 
 Leave it. 
 Listen, Axel, this hole you're in now, I've... I've been there, too. 
 You'll get out of it. 
 Not until I put this right. 
 We will. 
 Well, we got a long walk. 
 And wherever they're going we better get there first. 
 Come on. 
 It's not safe out here. 
 Are you sure that's a good idea? 
 [sniffing] 
 Ow! 
 Jesus mother... 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Remember, you leave the house, your kid dies. 
 Simple as that. 
 Great. 
 Now, rest up. 
 Hell of a big day tomorrow. 
 [blows nose] 
 The town looks completely abandoned. 
 Yeah. 
 Any human from miles around would go there to hole up. 
 And Max. 
 Get some sleep, okay? 
 Tell me about before. 
 Okay. 
 Before you were born, when you were just little in mommy's tummy, there were no vampires. 
 And you had a brother and a sister who could play in the grass and look at the stars without any fear. 
 But they're gone now? 
 Yeah, they're gone now. 
 But they lived a life you can't even imagine. 
 A life filled with happiness and joy, and a life that was safe and warm, and one day that life will come back and be yours. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 The sun will shine and you'll go to school and your friends will come overand play and you'll have cake and presents on your birthday. 
 When? 
 Someday. 
 But until then we survive. 
 Every day. 
 We stay safe and stay smart so we'll be alive when the world's the way it was before. 
 Okay? 
 Mom? 
 Yeah? 
 Is the man still helping? 
 Is he going to come? 
 Yeah, he is. 
 [groans] 
 Axel! 
 [snarling] 
 [groans] 
 You should have paid the toll! 
 [cries out in pain] Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!! 
 [floor creaks] 
 [gunshot] 
 Little sh1t! 
 Owen! 
 Owen! 
 The little á*áá*á shot me! 
 No, don't! He's just a kid! 
 Yeah, well it still á*áá*á hurts, doesn't it? 
 You need him, Max. 
 Okay? Just calm down. 
 You need him alive, right? 
 Don't- don't screw yourself over. 
 He shot me in the á*áá*á neck! 
 You need him. 
 á*áá*á! 
 Alright, get over here. 
 Go to your bed, now! 
 Ow! 
 You were one of them, weren't you? 
 Like Phil. 
 Oh yeah, best time of my life. 
 I was always a night owl anyway,you know, so losing the sun was never a big deal. 
 Never get to sleep, party never stops. 
 And blood? 
 Best high ever. 
 Get the kid. We're going. 
 But it's still dark out. Didn't you- 
 Now! 
 Now! Go! 
 Where the hell are my keys? 
 Oh, come on, where the á*áá*á are my keys? 
 [crash] 
 [screams] 
 [groans] 
 Why does your blood not flow? 
 It's a long story. 
 [screams in pain] Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!! 
 No! 
 [screaming] Ahhhhhh!!!!!!! 
 Axel!!! 
 We gotta get out of here! We're so close! 
 Hey! Hey! 
 You ugly son of a bitch, come here! 
 If you're so goddamn thirsty. 
 Come on, go for the jugular. 
 [screeching] 
 Oh, Jesus Christ. 
 What the hell are you? 
 [screeching] 
 [groans] 
 [grunts] 
 Hold him down! 
 Axel, we gotta go. We... 
 It's almost dawn. 
 We're gonna lose them if we don't go now. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Just give me a minute. 
 I got an idea. 
 [whispers] They're here. They're still here. 
 Okay, stay cool. This is no time to freak out. 
 Hey! 
 -I go first. -I go first. 
 Okay. 
 [gunshot] 
 [gunshot] 
 sh1t! 
 [gunshot] 
 Son of a bitch! 
 [gunshot] 
 Stay down! 
 He knows he can't kill me! 
 Yeah, but he knows he can slow you down. 
 [gunshot] 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on. 
 He's tucked in betweenthose two buildings over there. 
 [gunshot] 
 What're you doing?! 
 [gunshot] 
 Axel! 
 What'd you do that for?! 
 He saw me. 
 He thinks I'm dead for sure now. 
 He doesn't know I have what you- 
 [gunshot] 
 Whew! 
 á*áá*á A! 
 Got a bonus kill on that one. 
 Too bad, too. 
 I liked that guy before he tried to kill me. 
 You know that's not gonna stop Phil. 
 Yeah, but it'll buy me some time. 
 We're going to Matty's. 
 Who's Matty? 
 Don't you worry about it. 
 You'll have a very formal introduction. 
 Let's go! 
 Left. 
 You cause any trouble I kill the kid right here, right now. 
 You understand? 
 Good. 
 Matty! It's me, Max! 
 [knocking] Open up! 
 Matty! 
 Max. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Why don't you get the hell out here and find out? 
 Come on. 
 I need some of that fatty blood you got. 
 Best of the bunch. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
 No, I made a deal with your men. 
 We're all squared up now, up to date and done. 
 Well, something came up. 
 I need to get over the hills, Igotta pay the piper on the way. 
 I got... I got other customers,you know? 
 Hungriest biters in these parts. 
 Can't spare no more. 
 No more your way, no way. 
 Matty. 
 You really wanna turn that down? 
 Right up your alley, meek as a kitten, easy to handle. 
 Didn't cause me any trouble on the road. 
 She doesn't have much meat on her bones. 
 You can take care of that, that's kind of your specialty, right? 
 What do you say? 
 
 
 
 Throw in the boy, you got a deal. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 I got plans for him, okay? 
 Both of them or we're done. 
 Wanna bet on that? 
 'Cause you know I love to gamble! 
 No, no, no! 
 You kill me, you're never gonnamake it out of the badlands alive. 
 The vamps will revenge ya. 
 They need me and you know it. 
 Do I? 
 What's a little game of sport between friends, right? 
 Oh god! 
 Gotcha. Your turn. 
 Pay or play, Matty. What's it gonna be? 
 Deal. 
 Sweet. 
 No problem. 
 Give me the kid. 
 No. 
 It's coming with me. You're staying here. 
 No! No! 
 Stop! Stop! 
 Easy! Listen to me! 
 You lost! 
 Okay? Good fight. 
 You put up a good fight, but you lost. 
 No. 
 Do you want him to see you die first? Huh? 
 Would that be better? 
 You're not stupid. 
 You know that's the only choice here. 
 Either you let him leave here with me or he watches me tear you apart first. 
 What's it gonna be? 
 Let me say goodbye. 
 Tell him to behave himself. 
 Owen, come here, honey. 
 You're gonna have to go with Max for a little bit. 
 It won't be long, I promise, okay? 
 Just go with Max and stay out of trouble. 
 Give me the jars. 
 Give them to me in a bag or something. 
 As soon as he gets drunk again you run back here as fast as you can. 
 [whispers] I will get him, mom. 
 I know you will. 
 [sobbing] 
 Pitter patter, let's get at 'er. 
 Have fun, Matty. 
 [sobbing] 
 Come on. 
 If you try to kill me I swearto god you'll get more than you bargained for. 
 I'm not gonna kill you, honey. 
 God no. 
 Not for a good, long while at least. 
 Open up. 
 In you go. 
 [banging] 
 Hello! 
 [banging] 
 Hello! 
 Woah, woah, woah there. 
 Ha. Woah. 
 Give me a second. 
 Got me at an awkward moment there, if you know what I mean. 
 What're you doing all the way out here? 
 Minding my own business. 
 I suggest you do the same. 
 I'm looking for a woman and her son. 
 Have you seen them? 
 I think you might have seen them. 
 I don't know who you're talking about. 
 No one but me here. 
 See, that's the way I like it. 
 [cocks gun] 
 Oh, ho, ho, ho. 
 Easy now. 
 Drop the weapon. 
 Drop it. 
 Okay. 
 You cry out, you die. You got me? 
 Uh huh. 
 Are they inside? 
 They're gone. 
 Took some water and headed off,both of them. 
 Axel, look at that gear. 
 The prisoners in the bus. 
 Alright, the truth this time. 
 Are they inside? 
 I already told you, they're gone. 
 Flesh, hold up. Hold up! 
 Owen! 
 You don't want him to go in there alone. 
 Owen! Jennifer! 
 On your knees. Now! 
 Okay! Okay. 
 Owen! 
 Jennifer? 
 Jennifer? 
 Jennifer! 
 Jennifer! 
 Owen! 
 Jennifer! 
 Owen! 
 Jennifer! 
 Jen! 
 Owen! 
 [muffled screaming] 
 Jennifer? 
 [muffled screaming] 
 Jennifer? 
 [muffled screaming] 
 Jennifer! 
 Owen! 
 [muffled screaming] 
 I can give you all the blood you need. 
 Fatty blood. 
 They love that sh1t. They can feed off it for days. 
 Where's Max? 
 You know what he'll do to me. He'll kill me slow. 
 He'll... he'll cut me alive. 
 I could kill you right now, how'd that be? 
 [thud] 
 Where are they?! 
 Jennifer! 
 Jennifer! 
 [muffled screams] 
 Jennifer! 
 I got you. 
 Don't worry, I got you. 
 It's okay, it's okay. 
 Max took Owen! 
 It's okay. You're gonna be okay. 
 He took him! 
 We have to- 
 Come on, we gotta go. Let's go! 
 Okay, that's all I know, I promise. 
 I swear. You pay the toll and you get across. 
 They're headed for the river. 
 This asshole's got a pick-up truck in the shed. 
 Supposed to be some kind of vampire-free promised land. 
 This man is a á*áá*á psychopath. 
 Come on now- 
 [gunshot] 
 Let's go. 
 Stop dragging your feet. 
 Let me go! 
 Oh, don't you worry, you'll be rid of me soon enough. 
 Look. Mmm. 
 Kid. 
 I know that life has taken a bad turn on you recently. 
 I feel bad about that, really I do. 
 Look, I was a kid like you once. 
 I know what it feels like when everything turns shitty, and trust me. 
 You'll like where we're going, I promise. 
 [cries out in pain] Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!! 
 Mom! 
 sh1t! 
 You want some?! 
 [gunshots] 
 Owen! 
 Goddammit! 
 [screams in pain] 
 Come and get it! 
 I'm gonna take care of things this time. 
 You have to trust me. 
 Go get our son. 
 Give him to me! 
 Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. 
 Any closer and he dies. 
 Hand him over! 
 You really sure about that shot? 
 I mean, sure. 
 One to the head might put me down for a little bit but what if you miss? 
 See that? 
 I got no choice. 
 Neither do I! 
 I have to pay the toll. 
 He's coming with us! 
 What is that supposed to be, moxie? 
 I á*áá*á hate moxie. 
 Hey, hey. I got two gallons of the fatty blood and this little one. 
 Okay? All I want is safe passage. 
 [gunshot] 
 Woah! 
 Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah! 
 Easy! 
 You wanna bring the rest of themdown here? 
 Hey, hey. Listen to me, listen to me. 
 I'm not with them, okay? Do we have a deal? 
 Sounds good. 
 [gunshot] 
 [screams] Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!! 
 Owen! Owen! Owen! 
 Owen! 
 [groans in pain] 
 Hurts, doesn't it? 
 [groans] 
 You b*st*rd. 
 You sly b*st*rd. 
 I knew the second I laid eyes on you you were one tough son of a bitch. 
 And I knew you were an asshole. 
 Whatever. 
 That was then. 
 So what? 
 You gonna finish me? 
 I was turned into a vampire at the citadel. 
 Turned by Dmitri himself. 
 I turned back the day of the rebellion attack by the one they whisper about. 
 And then I was turned into whatever the hell this is by a daywalker. 
 sh1t. 
 sh1t. 
 sh1t, sh1t, sh1t. 
 I've been everything you could be. 
 May as well try dead. 
 I'd like to oblige, but I promised that privilege to someone else. 
 [grunts] 
 Don't look, it's okay. 
 Well, that'll do 'er. 
 Yeah. 
 Rot in hell, Max. 
 That's too good for him. 
 Thank you. 
 Just righting a wrong. 
 The least I could do. 
 The pain'll ease, time helps. 
 You don't think it will but it does. 
 My children, they're uh... 
 they're still with me sometimes. 
 What is this? 
 I'm out. 
 I'm done. 
 I can't go back there. 
 I'm not sure that's a choice you get to make. 
 I think it is. 
 I'm gonna cross that river, I'm gonna take my chances and I'm gonna... 
 I'm gonna take care of them if they'll let me. 
 What about you? 
 Same thing I always do. 
 Get back in the fight. 
 Right. 
 I'll pick up who's ever left alive back at the farm on the way. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks, man. 
 Take care of them. 
 I will. 
 You came. 
 That's right. 
 And I think that this is yours. 
 Wait. 
 These are Max's. 
 Woah! 
 Well done. 
 Hey, Axel! 
 Keys to the Jeep!
