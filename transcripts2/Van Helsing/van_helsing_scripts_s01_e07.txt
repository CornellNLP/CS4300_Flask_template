 ( snarling and growling ) 
 What are they saying? 
 They are going to execute us. 
 Holy sh1t, you made it back. 
 She needs a doctor now. 
 It's not healing over. 
 I sacrificed myself for you. 
 You lock my people up, you attack them! 
 Who's in here? 
 Who's in here? 
 It didn't have to be like this, man, not like this!! 
 No, it didn't. 
 You are basically sending us out there to die. 
 You mean exactly what you were about to do to us. 
 No Calli. 
 Calli!!!! 
 Make it outside the city, you might have a chance. 
 Aren't you curious? 
 It's for you. Please... 
 You like? 
 Oh yes, very much. 
 So tell me... 
 What are you and Rebecca doing? 
 Your laboratory? 
 Oh yes, of course. 
 More experiments... children. 
 I'm very hopeful that a solution can be found. 
 Why children? 
 They are rapidly growing organisms. 
 Alive with cellular division. 
 My serum is absorbed much faster than with a fully grown adult vamp. 
 One of your species. 
 I'm told she has a human companion... a woman. 
 Yes... Sheema. 
 Treats her like a pet. 
 Let's her come and go from the citadel. 
 I don't know what Rebecca sees in her. 
 She killed a group of humans to rescue her. 
 Rebels, traitors, all of them. 
 But not you. 
 No... you are a loyal human. 
 Of course, yes. 
 Implicitly. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 You stay. 
 It's true. 
 I saw one of ours. 
 Now one of them... turned. 
 And the woman? 
 Julius had her. 
 She escaped. 
 Escaped? 
 I'm disappointed. 
 It was Julius who failed. 
 He will try again... but not for you. 
 He and the old woman... they plan to hunt her... keep her for themselves. 
 They dare to defy me? 
 I made Julius... 
 I will end him. 
 He thinks you are weak. 
 ( Laughing ) 
 You go to him. 
 You tell him... no... no, no, no... wait. 
 I will tell him myself. 
 ( Screaming ) 
 Gah! 
 What's wrong? 
 Eat! 
 ( eating sounds ) 
 sh1t. Over here! ( growling and snarling ) ( growling and snarling continues ) No! ( snarling and grunting ) Get her! ( growling and snarling ) ( growling ) Hold your advance! State your business! Orders from Dmitri. We want the woman. Julius' prisoner. And what... ( Grunting ) Don't let her escape. No, please stop! Please, don't hurt me! Please! ( growling ) ( continues to please ) ( coughing ) Hey, hey, hey. Stay with me. You... you... What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? You can't save me. Hold on, hold on. I'm bleeding out. What are you even doing here? You're supposed to be at the hospital. Axel killed all my friends and he sent the rest of us out here to die. Wait a minute, how... how? I guess he got his wish. So what about everyone else? Kelly? Brendan? I... I don't know. We... we got attacked and Callie... she let go of my hand and... ( sobbing ) I'm sorry. What about Vanessa, did she make it back? Is she safe? She was bitten. Hurt... but... But what? She... Catherine? Hey, hey... Vanessa... Hey there, Doc. You're looking at her blood again? I never figured her out before. Maybe I can see something new this time. Just an awful lot like them, huh? Mmm... similar but different. She's like a mirror image, a negative. Maybe if we can synthesize it... undo vampirism forever, but... I don't know. So you're starting to care again? It's a mystery, that's all. I mean, would we really want the world back the way it used to be? After everything we've been through? Yeah, you wouldn't? Greed, ignorance... who's to say we wouldn't make all the same mistakes again? So what, we just hang out here for as long as we can survive? That's it, that's all we got? Maybe... maybe it's all pain, suffering and loneliness now. Doc, come on. We're gonna get out of this. You and me, I promise you. I have some samples in the... centrifuge, I... I'm going to dim the lights while she's sleeping ok? ( Grunting ) I got it, I got it. It's just the damn breaker. Axel, Axel... this place is falling apart. Yeah, given what's happened this is more of a death trap than a shelter. You're right, this place is going to sh1t. We need to do something about it. This old girl has been keeping me alive for three years plus. She deserves a little respect. Besides, y'all don't know what I got up my sleeve. Yeah, well I for one would like to know. Why don't you call a meeting? I don't want to ruin the surprise! And I don't wanna hear anymore of this about leaving. This is ten times safer than anything we're going to find out there. End of discussion. ( Groaning ) You're awake again, huh? Where does it hurt? God, everywhere! Mainly my leg. It burns. ( Coughing ) Oh, Jesus. You're not healing like usual. I know. How's she doing? That bad, huh? No, no... Right Doc? Do you have anything for the pain? Yeah. Thank you. ( Heavy breathing ) Sam! Sam! We got trouble. ( growling ) What's happening? Julius is leading a contingent up third street. They're coming to take you home? What? No, you guys don't get it. He was a top dog, he was one of Julius' lieutenants. That's no secret, everybody knows that. No, we knew you were one of them. We didn't know you were important. You people don't get it! No one's important to Julius except you. Hey! What's everybody standing around for? Grab your gear, it's game time. What is happening? As far as I can tell, Julius is about to tear this place a new asshole. Come on, let's go! Move! They're coming for me. It looks that way. How are you feeling? Weak... like I'm human again. You're worried about this attack. sh1t. Don't write us off just yet. There's three levels of hell to get through before they can get into this lab. And what happens when they get in this lab? Don't worry about that. If they get in here... I'll take you out myself. You'll take me out? If it comes to that. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Yeah. ( speaking Serbian ) ( speaking Serbian ) ( speaking Serbian ) ( Growling ) ( Grunting ) ( speaking Serbian ) ( small growls ) ( Yelling ) ( Hissing ) ( Screeching ) ( screeching and growling ) What are they doing? They're sacrificing themselves. Why do they want her so bad? No, it's not them. It's the others, Dmitri and Rebecca. Who? The ancients. They want her, they fear what she can do. Oh that's great, the ancients! Still feel confident? What, do I look nervous? I don't give a sh1t who they are. They're not getting in here. I'm with Sam. This is screwed. Let's go! ( Screeching ) ( Screeching ) It's their tactic. They're gonna throw bodies at this building until they get inside. What do we do? Fall back to the escalators and make a stand there. Get her. ( Screeching and Yelling ) ( pounding ) You two go upstairs and help with the barricade, I'm going to stay here with Sam, set up a perimeter in case they get past these traps. No, no, no... Sam can go with Flesh. I'll stay here with you. I'll be upstairs. You stay. Go on! You better have a plan to get us outta here if things go south. Yeah, sure. ( loud banging ) What's happening down there? I don't know but I'm going to find out. Get better, we may need your help. Your friend is interesting. She's been through a lot. Yeah, haven't we all? You know, she's one of the only people... Vanessa? Oh no, no, no! Vanessa? Vanessa! sh1t, come on! Vanessa, don't die on me. John? John, get over here now! Give me your hand! What can I do? I know nothing about this sh1t. You can do what I tell you to do! Keep the chest compressions going just like I'm doing. Like this, here. I'm gonna go get some meds. What's happening? The girl who we thought couldn't die is dying. Okay I got it, I got it. Come on! This is where we stop them. Good man. No way I'm going back to that vampire hellhole! Ready to rock. Alright then. Game on, soldier boy. Sweet. At least the adrenaline started her heart again. She has all the signs of sepsis but her body's not healing like usual. There could be something in the wound that's causing the toxicity. Can you fix her? I've only cut into dead bodies. What's the difference? The difference is you can't screw up with a corpse. Well does it matter at this point? You're confident cutting into dead people. Well, she's dead so it's the same thing. Either you don't do it and she's dead or you do it and screw up and she's dead. What have you got to lose? Yeah. Alright. Here... you're assisting me. What? 
 
 Okay... here we go... Oh... ( Roaring ) sh1t, here they come. Yeah, they're gonna be coming up quick through this kill box. Hit them them in the head and hard in short controlled bursts, conserve your ammo. This is it. This is it. Now what do we do? Once I cut into her, I need you to force the incision open. Keep it from closing out so I can get to whatever's killing her. Yeah, okay just go. You ready? Yeah, whatever. Ugh... Jesus Christ. Oh! Oh God. ( Screeching ) Game on!  Here they come! ( rapid gunfire ) ( rapid gunfire ) Everybody pull back, now! Go! What are you doing? Finishing this. ( explosion ) Oh... Jesus. ( Yelling ) Oh God! ( explosions ) Did we do it? Check the roof. Okay. ( Screaming ) Gustaf... you disappoint me. We need more warriors. I'll get more. ( Growling ) They're giving up. No... regrouping. This is gonna be a long night. A vampire tooth. Must've been what was poisoning her. Okay, you can close it up. I can definitely say I prefer working on corpses. Hey. How's she doing? Well, you missed all the fun but I can say she's gonna live. The question is, will we? If I have anything to say about it, we both will. I'm not convinced. Hey, Doc... I haven't forgotten what you did. Trying to save Smitty, saving me... what happened to you because of it... I will make sure you get through this. Or I'll die trying. How long do you think before they come back at us? Julius will never give up, no matter how many warriors he has to sacrifice. Why? Why do you think? She really means that much to him? No, not to him. Dmitri and Rebecca. Julius knows they want Vanessa, it's a play. For leverage? Possibly. For what? Who knows what vampires plan. Well you're one of them. So Dmitri, Julius, Rebecca... they're all what, they're all different? Look... as far as I understand it they're, uh, they're older... they're ancient. They were around before all hell broke loose. You sure know a lot about how they think, how they operate. Well it comes with the territory. Hey! Those are M-4s... AR-50s, that's military issue. Someone's giving someone hell. That's gotta be the resistance. No one else has that many guns. Those are soldiers, I promise you. One and the same. What's going on? Firefights out here. How's Vanessa? She's doing better, Doc says you're a big reason why. I just did what she told me to, but thanks. It's what saved her. Yeah well, I'd have done the same for any of these guys, I guess... mostly. Mohamad? Could be, could be anybody. It's a warning... there! They don't look friendly. Oh God. Dmitri's death squad. The elite. We're dead. ( gun shot ) Dmitri's death squad. They outnumber us. Do we fight? No... we live to die another day. ( Grunting ) They're retreating. Julius knows they can't win this fight. So it's a war of the vampires, huh? It's been heading this way for a while. We could use that. Get them killing each other, could buy us some time for a counterattack of our own. We'd have to leave the building for that. What time do we leave? No, no, no... this is still the safest place we got by a long shot. You better be right. What happened? You died... again. I brought you back. I feel sick. I gave you something to get you on your feet, fast. We're not staying long. Bring the woman to me! You can stay or leave but decide now! So... They're gonna get in, we're gonna die. Not if I have anything to do with it. You gonna call their bluff? I wouldn't mess with them, Axel. It's Vanessa they want. Seriously? Just like that? I'm just saying what everyone's thinking. You don't speak for me. You don't speak for me either! We don't even know who you are. Listen, Vanessa's the only reason they haven't burnt this place to the ground. He's right. She's the only thing keep us alive right now. Vanessa will be fine, they can't turn and they're not likely to kill her if they came all this way. Maybe that's the answer. I'm toxic to them. What if we used my blood and dispersed it like a chemical weapon? Could turn them human... they'd be easier to kill. If they're human, why would we kill them? There's a point. Nuh uh. There's no way I could make it fast enough. Plus, I might need all of her blood to pull it off. No, there's no way. Good plan for another time maybe. Then we need to start talking exit strategy, Axel. Ask me again in an hour. I guess that means end of discussion. You knew this was coming. You knew this was coming, it's been three years. ( Muttering ) You're just not gonna let them in, that's it! You've got a plan. You know what you're doing, you know what you're doing! They don't get in, that's it. They just don't get in. Semper fi, son of a bitch, semper fi. Semper fi. Hey. Hey. I think Axel may have lost it. I just saw him talking to himself in the hallway. I'm worried that he may have gone AWOL... mentally. He's got no plan to get us out of this. Between that and whatever the vampires have planned for us... You heard what they said, we hand over Vanessa, we all keep our... Jesus Christ. What's going on? Those things come marching in here in five minutes, you know Vanessa's the only one that gets out of here in one piece, right? Where's Axel? Having a breakdown somewhere. There's no plan to get us out of here, he's freakin' delusional. Look, he spent the last three years turning this place into a fortress... you don't think he knows what he's doing? No. Not anymore. Nicole found him talking to himself like a crazy person! Everybody talks to themselves. When was this? 10 minutes ago. What's going on? Reality check. If we're all going to die up here, we'd like to know. You still think we're going to make it through this alive? Most of us. We need to know there's a plan. Right now. Well, I got a truck parked downstairs, John. I just need to wait for the valet to bring it around. I'm serious! ( Screaming ) sh1t, they're in the escalators. It's too late now. Yeah, too late for what? To just hand Vanessa over to those things? And then what was gonna happen Johnny, in your little mind? They're just gonna say, hey thanks guys! Go ahead! You know, have a nice day. There's gotta be another way out of this death trap. Nicole! Let her go, let her go! Anybody that wants to live, follow me. You think you got a better idea? You do whatever you want. What, are we just gonna leave her here? Keep advancing. What do we do now? Well they still have to make it through the UV lights and there's no way that's gonna happen. And if they do, then what? Well, then we say our prayers. There's only one play left in the playbook. Let's barricade these doors! What are our chances, Axel? Axel, John asked you a question. I don't know! Better than even. The lights will cook any vampire, we know that. ( pounding ) Here they come. What the hell? What the freak? ( smashing glass ) ( smashing glass ) Wait... I know him. ( smashing glass ) That's the guy who killed me. Oh God,, I must have turned him. Oh sh1t, he's human. Everybody go, now! Run! Back! Back! ( smashing glass ) sh1t! sh1t! ( gunfire ) ( gunfire ) ( gunfire) Damnit! God damnit. ( gun fire ) Humans, with them? Grab your stuff and get to the inner lab, now! Axel, what about Nicole? I can go back for Nicole, Axel. Oh really? What are you going to do, back through there, through them? Well, which direction would you suggest? This guy, you gotta be kidding me? He's going to join forces with them and help them! I'm not one of them! I don't trust this guy. I'm not one of them! You keep saying that... Will you shut up? The only way we're getting out of here at this point is all of us or none of us. It's time to abandon ship. Isn't it too late for that? How the hell are we supposed to do that four floors up? Sam, you help Vanessa. Follow me. Really? This is this? Really. Go, go, go! I knew there was a reason you were protecting this door. One last surprise. ( siren wailing ) Where does this go? Down, it's just down. Everybody grab a dish bag, let's go. Not him. He stays. What ? I don't trust him, I never have. John, come on. You're gonna pull this sh1t right now? Ask your friend. She said he's close with Julius. Close to Julius, that's what she said! No, I said he was one of them. That's... that's all I said. Come on, this is ridiculous. Everyone shut up, just shut up! We're all so sure of ourselves, huh? Sure we have the answers? We don't know sh1t. If you're so goddamn sure about Flesh, then pull the goddamn trigger already, John. Enough bullshit! Quit talking about it and pull the trigger! Good. I didn't think so! Good. Now everybody shut up! Listen to Axel and get down the stairs! You heard the lady, go! Come on! Move! So long, old girl. ( siren continues to wail ) ( beeping ) ( Grunting ) ( Yelling ) ( beeping ) Oh sh1t! ( explosion ) Holy sh1t. This is Wanda! You'll take me out, huh? I wasn't lying. Ambulance. Yeah, a few modifications. Come on, let's go! Go, go, let's go! ♪ ♪ Whoo! Ha ha, whoo! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about. Where the hell did that thing come from? ♪ Guys? ♪ No, no, no, no! Guys? Guys! Guys! This way! Guys, wait for me, guys, guys! ♪
