 Previously on Van Helsing: 
 Ever since the rising, my primary goal is to protect you. 
 By keeping me locked in this compound? 
 Yes. 
 That's for my protection. 
 'Cause I wasn't going to let what happened to your sister happen to you. 
 I was on a school trip out of state when the rising happened. 
 By the time I found my way back home, my family was nowhere to be found. 
 Vi! It's chaos over here! 
 Everyone is attacking each other! 
 We're hiding in the hotel. 
 I don't know how much longer we can hide for. 
 Just stay there! 
 No, Vi please! It's too late! They're here! 
 Jack! 
 [street sounds] 
 [music playing in headphones] 
 [dance music playing] ♪ A plenty more where they came from. 
 How? 
 Chuck the bellhop, hooked me up with the keys to the mini bar. 
 Was a little shameless flirting involved? 
 Use it if you have it. 
 Are you jealous? 
 He's not my type. 
 No. 
 That I didn't bat my eyes at you. 
 Isn't that what's happening right now? 
 Is it working? 
 [loud belch in the background] 
 More drinks! 
 Okay, I'm gonna go to our room before Brittany pukes all over me. 
 Oh, come on, Shona. 
 You're... 
 Yeah, loosen up! 
 [giggling] 
 I think you are loose enough for the both of us, okay? 
 Happy hangover in the morning. 
 You're awesome. 
 You're awesome. 
 Oh, no. 
 You really are. 
 You're so good. 
 We wouldn't even be here for this tournament if it wasn't for you. 
 We made it as a team. 
 No, seriously. 
 How did you get so good? 
 Huh? Huh? 
 Hey, guys! Don't you think maybe we should call it a night? 
 We have a big day tomorrow. 
 Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. 
 áááá tomorrow, it's all about tonight! 
 Whoo!! 
 Woah. 
 I'm really hot. 
 No, no, no, no, keep that on. It's okay... 
 Okay. Guys... 
 I'm gonna get ice. 
 ♪ 
 Hey. 
 Someone as hot as you shouldn't stand so close to the ice machine because you'll melt it. 
 Everything. 
 [laughs] 
 Does a line like that ever work? 
 Time will tell and we will see. 
 I'm just gonna... 
 Creeper alert. 
 No. 
 No. 
 He's not creepy, he's... he's cute. 
 He's edgy. 
 He's a little dangerous. 
 Yeah, in a Walking Dead kinda way. 
 [laughs] 
 You okay? 
 -Yeah. -Okay. 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm tired. 
 -Totally. That's it. -I get it. 
 Whoever invented tequila is an asshole. 
 Ugh, I can still taste it in the back of my throat. 
 Can you please not even say "tequila"? 
 Sorry. 
 My liver is so screwed. 
 I can't believe we have to play a match in a couple hours. 
 The only target I wanna hit is one with a pharmacy. 
 [groans] 
 That's good. Archery humour. 
 -Coach is gonna love that. -Yeah. 
 -Speaking of... -No. 
 Look alive. 
 Oh, my god. I stood up way too fast. 
 [clears throat] 
 Well? 
 Is there a problem? 
 Partying in your room 'til 2:00 am? 
 3:00. 
 [giggling] 
 Underage drinking? 
 [giggling] Sorry. 
 [laughing] 
 I expect more from varsity athletes, especially you, Jack. 
 It's not funny, it's not funny. 
 We'll be fine, I swear. 
 Mmhmm. 
 The booze is leaking out of your pores, ladies. 
 Yeah. 
 [uncontrollable giggling] 
 Mark my words, there will be consequences when we get back to D.C. 
 For now, load up! 
 Our bows are in there! 
 We still have a match. 
 So loud, dude. 
 [loud rumbling] 
 Earthquake! 
 Okay, get away from the building! 
 [loud rumbling continues] 
 I think it's over. 
 No, it's not. 
 [sirens wailing] 
 Oh, my god, guys, can you believe that this just happened? 
 Are you seeing this right now? 
 Oh, this is the coolest thing that's ever happened to me. 
 Come on. Say "hi", everyone. 
 -Hi, hi, hi. -Hello, fam. 
 Wave, come on, Shelley. 
 She's just mad 'cause she's a bit hung over. 
 Hey, do you guys think this means the tournament's cancelled? 
 Shona, Shona, Shona, Shona, Shona. 
 Hi. Say "hi". 
 Shut it off. 
 Please? 
 Vi. 
 [Vi] Jack, are you okay? 
 It's like ground zero over here. 
 I didn't think that volcano was actually gonna blow. 
 People are freaking out. 
 Here, too. 
 Dad had me pulled out of school. 
 He's bringing me to his office right now. 
 You're on the east coast. 
 This shouldn't be a threat to you over there. 
 Maybe. 
 I've never heard Dad sound like this before. 
 Ever. 
 Maybe this is more serious than we think. 
 Oh, the news! Can you turn on the news? 
 [incoming call] 
 Hey, wait. It's Dad. 
 I'm just gonna ask him what he knows and I'll call you right back, okay? 
 You better. 
 There's a giant ash cloud in the sky. 
 Hey. 
 Dad, I'm okay. 
 Just go outside and look. 
 Dad? 
 Dad, I can't hear you. 
 Hello? 
 Mom? 
 -Guys, can anybody get anything? -No. 
 No. 
 Let's go inside. 
 This ash can't be good to breathe. 
 I think we should wait for an alert or something. 
 The authorities will tell us what to do. 
 Why can't we just wait inside? 
 [screaming in the distance] 
 -Hey! -What the hell? 
 -Oh, my god! -Oh, my god!! 
 Hey! 
 Stop that! 
 Hey, Coach, I think we should wait inside. 
 Oh, my god! 
 Oh my god!! 
 Hey! 
 Oh my god, what's happening? 
 Get off her! 
 ...Help! 
 [growling and screeching] 
 [screaming] 
 Stay behind me. Just stay. 
 Coach! Coach! 
 Are you okay? 
 Coach? 
 She's breathing. 
 Come on, let's get her inside. 
 Let's get her inside. 
 Yeah, we'll get her some help. 
 Okay? 
 I got you, I got you! 
 Come on, it's gonna be okay. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 I got you. 
 Guys, a little help. 
 [loud roar] 
 [screaming] 
 Run! Run! Run! 
 Come on, Jack! 
 [crying] What's happening to everyone? 
 Shh. Keep your voices down. 
 Move, move, move. 
 Go, go, go, go, go! 
 Hey, can anybody get a signal? 
 No signal. 
 Me too. 
 Okay, we need something heavier. 
 Help me with this. 
 The coach, she she got attacked and then she changed, so... 
 Holy sh1t! 
 Did you see her face? 
 Maybe it's a really bad virus or something. 
 Get away from the window! 
 This can't be real! 
 Did you see the guy who attacked the coach is the same creep from last night? 
 What creep? 
 We saw him in the hall. 
 What, you didn't think that was worth sharing? 
 It's a hotel, they're full of creepy, weird-looking people. 
 They don't turn into monsters like that. 
 This can't be happening! 
 What if they're vampires? 
 Vampires? 
 Or zombies? 
 I don't know, do you have a better explanation? 
 Hey, can somebody please call 911? 
 Yeah, my cell is still failing! 
 Shona, where's yours? 
 It's in my room at the end of the hall. 
 What kind of person leaves their phone in their room?! 
 Just calm down! 
 Don't tell me to calm down! 
 You calm down! 
 I'm not the one freaking out! 
 Hey, just keep it together, okay? 
 If we're gonna get through this, whatever this is, we're gonna have to have each other's backs, got it? 
 -Vi? -Jack! -Vi! 
 Hey! 
 What- what's happening over there? 
 They locked us in. 
 It's chaos over here. 
 Everybody's attacking each other and our coach just went psycho. 
 We're hiding in the hotel and I don't know how much longer we can hide here for. 
 Dad said he sent people to find you. 
 Vi, I'm scared. 
 Stay put. You have to hold on, okay? 
 I don't think we can do that. 
 But I need you to be okay. 
 Just tell me where they're taking you. 
 Tell me where I can find you! 
 Vi, please tell me where I can find you! 
 What am I going to do? 
 [screaming] 
 [screaming] 
 Wait, wait! My phone! 
 No, Kim! 
 Kim, Kim, don't- 
 [screaming] 
 [smash] 
 [screaming] 
 [screaming] 
 [crying] Oh, sh1t. 
 Is... is she... 
 [snarling and growling] 
 [screaming] 
 [sobbing] 
 I'm sorry. 
 I killed her. 
 Before she killed us. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hey. Hey, Hey. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 I didn't mean to. 
 I didn't mean to. 
 Hey, hey. You had to. 
 You had to. 
 You had to, okay, Jack? 
 We gotta go. Jack, we gotta go. 
 Get up, get up. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Come on, Jack. Come on. 
 Go. Go. 
 We need to find some place to hide. 
 Some place we can barricade until we- 
 Until what? Another one of us dies? 
 I don't know. 
 Jack. 
 [sobbing] 
 Come on. Come on. 
 [fire alarm rings] 
 Wait. 
 [fire alarm rings] 
 Everyone needs to find something to defend themselves. 
 All we have are our bows. 
 I can't kill anyone. 
 It's not about killing, it is about surviving. 
 Do you get it? 
 It's what we trained for at the academy. 
 Maybe none of us thought we'd get dropped into the middle of a war zone but here we are. 
 Stay. 
 We are going to find shelter and we're gonna get in contact with someone who can help us. 
 And we're gonna defend ourselves until then, okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 I need you, Jack. 
 I can't do this without you. 
 [sobbing] 
 Police station. 
 There's a police station up the street. 
 Okay, we passed it when we got here, remember? 
 If anywhere is safe it's there. 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. 
 [distant screams] 
 sh1t. 
 sh1t. 
 Okay. 
 When I say "go", don't stop whatever you do. 
 Single file, have each other's backs. 
 Shona, you've got our six. 
 If we get into trouble, attack as one. 
 Don't get separated. Are you ready? 
 Ready. 
 Ready! 
 [Announcement] Attention! We are in a state of emergency. 
 Remain inside. 
 Lock your doors. 
 It is not safe. 
 [phones ringing] 
 [Man's voice] Can you hear me? Is there anybody there? 
 [office phones continue to ring] 
 [voice trembling] Hello? 
 Where are all the police? 
 This is bad. 
 This is so bad. 
 Just keep moving. 
 Hello? 
 Is anybody here? 
 There are no cops. 
 Where are you going? 
 [phone continuing to ring] 
 [screams] 
 What? 
 What?! 
 Uh, guys! 
 We should grab his gun, right? 
 What? 
 We have to protect ourselves. 
 I'm not touching him. 
 You do it. 
 Fine. 
 I'll do it. 
 It's empty. 
 What now? 
 My phone is dead. 
 Jack. 
 Please, it's your- your phone is the last one we have. 
 Okay, um. 
 Shona. Shona... 
 Uh, land- landlines maybe, right? 
 Maybe they'll work. 
 Please work. Please, please work 
 [dial tone] 
 I'm calling 911. 
 911? 
 The cops are dead! 
 Can you just shut up, Brittany? 
 [no dial tone] 
 No, no, no! No, no! 
 No, no! 
 sh1t! 
 What? What's happening? 
 Before there was a dial tone. 
 Now there's nothing. 
 Well, um, we... we have to keep trying. So... 
 Oh, you think you can do better, Brittany? 
 The phone is dead! 
 And so are we. 
 We're dead. 
 I'm okay. 
 What you did back there, you had to. 
 You saved us. 
 We are alive because of you. 
 I didn't save Kim. 
 You did what none of us could have. 
 You were brave. 
 You were amazing. 
 You... 
 Brave? I killed her. 
 No. You killed whatever she had become. 
 What you did saved us, Jack. 
 You are the strong one. 
 You always have been. 
 You call this strong? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 I do. 
 [loud noise] 
 What the áááá was that?! 
 Shh. 
 There's one of them in there. 
 I'll go check. 
 I'm gonna come with you. 
 [gunshot] 
 [Man's voice] Stay back! 
 Guys... 
 [screaming] 
 Stay the hell back! 
 Look, we're not like those things out there, okay? 
 We're not! 
 We're not! 
 How do I know? 
 Look at us! 
 Look, we're just trying to survive this, okay? 
 We came in here for protection and that's it. 
 That's it. 
 Okay? 
 I didn't mean to hurt her. 
 I know you didn't. 
 I know you didn't. 
 Okay? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Put the gun down. 
 Okay? 
 Just go on. Just put it down. 
 Please just put it down. 
 Put it down. 
 [drops pipe] 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Where is everybody else? 
 They're gone. 
 Dispatch went crazy. 
 When the phone calls came through everybody left their posts and went to save their families. 
 And you? 
 I stayed here with a couple others. 
 And then those things got in here. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I know you're scared, right? 
 So am I. 
 [sobbing hysterically] Hey, Hey! 
 Shona needs some help!!!! 
 Do you know, um... where... where a first aid kit would be? 
 I don't know where- no, I don't know. 
 What do you mean "you don't know"? 
 Just think, think! 
 Where do you think a first aid kit might be? 
 Okay, where? 
 Come on! You just shot our friend! 
 Please help us. Please. 
 The... the last door down there. 
 Thank you. 
 This way? 
 Yeah, that's the one. Right there. 
 Okay. This one? 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Okay, um... 
 Um... 
 Yes, here. 
 [Jack] What's your um, first name, Officer Little? 
 Shona, hey, Hey, we got it. 
 -Derek. -Derek. 
 Okay. 
 [Shelley] It's going to be totally okay? 
 [Officer Little] They're gonna be dead. 
 That's what's gonna happen, we're all gonna die! 
 sh1t, there is nothing in here! 
 There's gotta be another way out of here. Something. 
 [Officer Little] Yeah, the back. 
 [Jack] Okay. The back. 
 [Officer Little] Out that way. 
 [Jack] Okay. 
 Um, is there a... a vehicle? 
 Do you have a car? 
 No. Everyone is gone. 
 My- my partner took my squad car. 
 [Shelley] Jack, Jack!!! 
 I need your help! I don't know what to do! 
 Jack! 
 Um, I'm gonna be right back, okay? 
 Okay. 
 She's bleeding. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 Shona. 
 I'm gonna take this off and I'm gonna look at your wound, okay? 
 I just need to make sure nothing's hit your organ. 
 Ready? 
 [wincing in pain] 
 [Jack] This is bad. This is really bad. 
 Tell me the truth, Jack. 
 How bad is it? 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 We're gonna get you a doctor. 
 Oh, bullshit. 
 If the cop shop looks like this there's no way a hospital survived. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Just leave me here. 
 No. 
 Leave me here. 
 No, you don't talk like that. 
 No, come on. 
 Eagles for life, right? 
 [Brittany] You can't go out there. 
 What do you mean? 
 What other option do we have? 
 We? 
 We? 
 What? 
 It's fine. You just stay here. 
 You stay here and you make sure that she stays awake. 
 Hey. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah? Okay. 
 Make sure she stays awake. 
 You are not going alone. 
 I'm coming with you. I am coming with you. 
 Brittany? Brittany. 
 Hey. 
 All you have to do is hold it, okay? 
 You'll be fine. Brittany, Brittany... 
 Give me your gun. 
 No way. 
 Please? I can't make this run without it. I need it. 
 Not a chance. 
 Okay, well then where's the armoury? 
 It's been picked over. 
 The only bullets are mine. 
 [Brittany] You asshole. 
 She wouldn't have to go if it wasn't for you! 
 You forget that I'm the one in charge here! 
 Hey! 
 Please. 
 Keep it. 
 Keep it. 
 We have to go. 
 Jack, we have to go. 
 Please. 
 I need you to promise me that you're gonna be here when I get back, okay? 
 
 
 
 Promise? 
 Go. 
 Okay. 
 Just- just go. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Hey, wait! 
 Listen. 
 Underneath this building there's a parking garage. 
 Go down there, it'd be safer than taking the street. 
 Just... just take the employee corridor. 
 There's a door on the- on the right side. 
 Go up to the street level. 
 It empties out near a... a free clinic. 
 You might find a doctor there. 
 Door on the right, up to street level. 
 Okay, go. 
 Come on. Jack, please. Let's go. 
 Shh. Shh. 
 Okay, okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Let's go. 
 You can do it. 
 [distant screams] 
 [Woman] ...Somebody help! Somebody! 
 Let's go. 
 [car dinging] 
 We're in the deep end, now. 
 Yeah. 
 They could be anywhere. 
 [whispers] sh1t! 
 Hide! 
 [Woman] Hello? 
 [footsteps approaching] 
 Is someone there? 
 A real someone? 
 [whispers] Hey. 
 Hey, come here. 
 Come here. 
 Oh my god. 
 [sobbing] 
 Shh. 
 Did you see anyone else out there? 
 [sobbing] 
 We were attacked up on the street. 
 They got my David. 
 Shh. 
 We lost a friend, too. 
 They talk about the end of days at church. 
 I never imagined it would be like this. 
 We need to keep moving. 
 We need to keep moving. 
 Where are you going? 
 We're going to the clinic. 
 It's two levels up. 
 Is it safe? 
 I don't know. 
 Our friend is hurt. 
 Did she get bit by one of those things? 
 Shh- No. 
 Are you sure? 
 Because that's how it spreads. 
 The bites. 
 She didn't get bit. 
 She got shot, okay? 
 What do you mean, that's how it spreads? 
 Is this thing some sort of virus? 
 All I know is one of those nightmares grabbed my David and bit him in the neck and then his face turned into a monster! 
 Shhh! 
 Alright. Okay. 
 You're safe with us, okay? 
 No, I'm not. 
 No, I'm not. 
 No one is. 
 They're gonna find us and they're gonna kill us or worse! 
 I need you to be quiet. 
 I need you to be very quiet, okay? 
 Okay. 
 [gasps] 
 We've gotta get out of here! 
 Shhh! Stay down. Stay down. 
 I'll get to my car. 
 You have a car? 
 It's close I think. 
 What do you mean, you think? 
 Well, I couldn't get to it but if I can I could take us where we need to go. 
 Where it's safe. 
 We could go to our friends. 
 We could find a hospital. 
 No. 
 I'm leaving. 
 Either you come with me right now or we... 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Come on. 
 [car unlocks] 
 I'm gonna take my hand off your face but I'm gonna need you to be very quiet. 
 Can you do that? 
 Yeah. 
 Why? 
 Why would you do that? 
 That was our way out. 
 She just saved your life. 
 We're so close to the exit. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 No, I'm not going. 
 We stay together. 
 You're headed straight to those things. 
 Keep your voice down. 
 No. They'll find us, you know they will. 
 The best we can do is pray. 
 Hell has risen and will swallow us whole. 
 -We have to go! -The end of time is nigh! 
 Come on, she'll get us killed. Come on! 
 I curse all of you demon seed!

 Shelley! 
 No!

 See? I killed one, too. 
 I'm okay.

 Anything that will keep Shona alive.

 It's Vi. 
 [laughs] 
 Vi? 
 Jack! 
 Vi, where are you? 
 Jack. Can you hear me? 
 Vi, I'm okay. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm in a helicopter. 
 Dad is evacuating us to a safe location. 
 He's sending the chopper to the roof of your hotel. 
 It's gonna be there in 20 minutes. 
 You have to be there! 
 Vi, we're at the police station. 
 Send it there. 
 Did you hear me? 
 Send the helicopter to the police station! 
 [Shelley] Jack! Jack! 
 [Vi] It's your only shot. 
 I found what we need. 
 [Vi] Jack. It's your only shot. 
 You have to be there! 
 Can you hear me?

 We're gonna find a way. 
 I'll see you soon, okay? 
 I promise.

 We have to go. 
 Now.

 Brittany! 
 Brittany! 
 Shona! 
 What happened? 
 Son of a bitch was paranoid. 
 He thought Shona was infected. 
 Said he'd kill her so I took his gun. 
 You did what you had to do. 
 Jack, Jack. 
 She's bleeding so much. 
 [Shona] No doctor, huh? 
 No, uh, we couldn't find a good one so um, this is all we've got. 
 It's not gonna be enough. 
 Put this on and squeeze it. 
 Or press down as hard as you can. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 It's gonna be fine. 
 We just need to stop the bleeding long enough to get you in the helicopter. 
 What helicopter? 
 The one that's gonna get us out of here. 
 Okay, come on. 
 It's okay. 
 We're gonna wrap this around you tightly and it's gonna stop the bleeding just for a little while, okay? 
 Just long enough. 
 We're gonna get you up, okay? 
 Come on, help us up. 
 You can do this. 
 There you go. 
 Get up. 
 Up. 
 Okay. 
 Here. 
 Now you're up. 
 Okay. 
 There's something wrong with Shona. 
 Jack, what's going on? What's happening? 
 I don't know... um... 
 I'll get behind her. 
 Come on. 
 Shona, no. Come on, Shona. You got this. 
 Okay, come here. 
 It's okay, babe. It's okay. 
 I got you. It's okay. 
 Keep pressing. Keep pressing. 
 I am. 
 -She's losing a lot. -I am. I know. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 I know. 
 Just breathe. Just breathe. Come on. 
 Hold her still. Hold her still. 
 I'm trying. 
 Hold her still. Come on.

 No, no. 
 Um... It's okay. 
 We did- we did everything. 
 We're almost there! 
 They're coming. 
 We have to stand our ground and fight them. 
 It's the only way we can get to the roof. 
 How many bullets do you have? 
 How many?! 
 Two. 
 Be calm. 
 Make them count.
