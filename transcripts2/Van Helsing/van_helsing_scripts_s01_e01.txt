 (dramatic music) 
 (dramatic music) 
 (screaming heard in the distance) 
 (distant gunfire and screaming) (growling) There she is, take her! (continued growling and snarling) (continued growling and snarling) (Vomits) Blargh! (panting) (growling) (fighting grunts) (fighting grunts) (fighting grunts) The little things I miss, you know? I mean, I miss my family and all that sh1t, of course, but... it's just the little things. Going to Subway for lunch. (chuckles) Double meat on my sandwich, just 'cause. I don't know, man. I'm just talkin', which you're probably pretty sick of by now, right? Hmm. Yeah, that's ok. Go ahead. Yeah, that's it, Doc. Drink up. That's good. I'd be fed up if I was you, too. I mean, it's not your fault. Oh yeah, and Kit Kats. I miss Kit Kats. That little chocolate candy with the cookie thing in the middle and it goes snap when you break 'em. Click, click, click... I miss Kit Kats. Probably a ton of 'em out there, too, just sittin' there in stores. Might as well be on the other side of the moon all the good it does me in here. Hey, woah. Hey. Easy there. (snarls) Hey! (growls) Ooh-ee, just about drained me dry today, Doc. (siren wails) Oh, sh1t. There's something dickin' around by the south west entrance. Goddammit. (laughing) They're coming. (laughing) So I will go take care of it. You just relax, Doc. I got this. Doc : They're coming! Goddamn apocalypse. They're coming! They're coming! They're coming! (laughter) (siren continues) Let us in! Please let us in! Open this door! Let us in! Please let us in! Open this door! I can't let you in here, I'm sorry! (Yelling) Just open this door! You have to let us in! Do not attempt to open the door. It's booby-trapped. You will not succeed. (Commotion continues) Let us in!! I am a United States marine and I have been ordered to guard this facility! I can't compromise my mission with this, I'm sorry. Open the door, marine, goddammit! Ted? Yes, it's me, asshole! Open the door! That's a direct order! Let us in this place! Please open this door! They're coming! You gotta let us in! Inside, go, go, go! Now! Go! Go! Move! Get inside now!! Wendy! To me! John! Wendy! Get your ass in here! John! Wendy! (gunfire) Get your ass inside now! Go! Go!! (gunfire) (growling) (gunfire) (rapid gunfire) Go! Go! Go! Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go! Inside! Inside! Thank you. Thank you! What's up with that guy? That's Sam. Don't worry about thanking him, the guy's deaf. He can't hear you. Wendy! Did she make it? I thought she was with you. She was-she was right behind me. Wendy! Wendy! It must be serious... I'll explain it all when we're alone. Roger that. You make that Tin-Man outfit yourself? Real crafty. Oh, I am seriously glad you're still here! You smell like gas, brother. Hey. My wife's out there. I thought she got in but she got lost in the fray. We gotta go get her. There's nothing I can do about that. I'm sorry. What are you talking about? A woman is stuck out there. She's gonna get torn apart by those things! Opening those doors will compromise this facility and everything about our mission. It's not gonna happen! (yells) Hey, John! John! (screams) Everybody upstairs, now. End of discussion. Thanks for changing the codes on that door. You were gone for six months. b*st*rd. Just be grateful I've still got the UV lights up and running. You know, I never even made it back to the base. I got cut off, tracked, chased all over hell. Hey, the other guys... Gomez, Smitty... they make it back? No. I should have stayed put. Yeah, maybe. What about you? You been ok here? Oh, buddy, a barrel of laughs. Yeah, I bet. How is she? Is she still... Oh yeah, she's still whatever she is. Sleeping beauty. So, just you and the Doc? This whole time? (chuckles) Eh? You'll see. Yeah? I love what you've done with the place. (growls) (screams) Woah, woah, woah. Jesus! He's got a pet one! It's ok. It's ok. Is that the doc? Oh my god. (snarling) Yeah, she got bit. And then I've just been... Oh, this ought to be good. She was part of this mission, too, smart ass. Wasn't she? Yeah, but I... Jesus. Well alright then. Anybody touches her, I'll throw them off the roof. She's been bit! She's a vampire! And what about this chick? This "chick"... doesn't exist as far as you're concerned. You understand me? (cocks gun) I said "do you understand me"? Ok then. That's good. Do you think we're safe in here? Huh? With one of those things pent up and then some... I don't even know what, in that other room, huh? It's true. Plus, look how he's treated John's wife. I mean, he's an animal. You leave a guy in a cage, it's not a surprise he becomes an animal. Ok, shh. He's an animal with a machine gun. Oh, please. You know he's feeding her, right? That vampire? He's actually feeding her his own blood. Hey there, soldier man. Axel, right? Your name, I mean. Come on, man. I'm tryin'. Ok, great. Well, look. I'm sorry about what happened earlier, obviously I was a little... but my wife's out-out there. Yeah, she was... Yeah. You gotta help me. At least let me out there. I don't care what happens to me, ok? Really, I don't, but my wife's stuck out there. I already told you, we're not opening those doors again. It's too dangerous. It's suicide out there. You know what it's like, you've been out there. Listen to me. (dishes clatter) Listen! I need to get out there! It's not gonna happen. (dishes clatter) Enough! Enough. Now, I get how you feel, I do. But there is nothing that we can do for her. Alright! So we stay inside. Alright. End of discussion. I can't believe the Doc. She was always... Yeah. Six months now. It happened right when you and the boys headed out. What? I was giving you covering fire. She um... Yeah, no, I remember. You were up on the roof. Yeah. She went down to make sure the door got shut behind you. I told her she didn't have to do it but she insisted. And then all hell broke loose, you guys were getting picked off... She tried to help Smitty get back inside and one of them... got a hold of her. Took a chunk out of her arm. She turned right after that. Damn. Yeah, pretty much. It's just... it's gonna be a tough sell, convincing some of those people to live in the same place as one of those things. I'm not convincing nobody of nothing. And I never said they were staying. That's very true, you did not. Look, I'll give you the door codes later, a set of keys. Maybe a couple of the others if I feel like I can trust them. Yeah, that's a good idea. We're gonna need all the help we can get. Always something about acting out. Especially that John guy. Don't... watch that there. And this, this bad boy's new. Damn, you're like Robinson Crusoe or some sh1t. How'd you hook up with that crew? Hiding in holes in basements, anywhere you can think of. You find another frightened fish and you just decide to throw in together. You're running. Always running. Ferals, chasing you like wild animals... The feeders, smarter... Tracking you down. You don't know what it's like out there. You have no idea. A person will do anything for just one more day. Anything. Robinson Crusoe! Robinson! (growling) Now, while they're not here. Kill the other one, too. Yeah, let's do it. Hell yes. Woah, woah, woah, woah. Back up, people. This is not a petting zoo. Who are you supposed to be? Shaka Zulu? In charge, that's what. Until the army guy comes back. (growls) Yeah, that's right. You're real tough. Try me, ass face. Get out of my freakin' way... now. Another time. What? (low growls) (growl) (low growls) (growling) (low growl) Incoming! (gunfire) Sam! Sam! Vampires swarming. (gunfire) Let's go! (fighting grunts) (screaming and chaos) (screaming) (screaming) Clear! Clear! (gun shots) (fighting grunts) (gun shots) (screaming) (laughing maniacally) Oh, my god! Please help me!!! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry! (sobbing) I'm sorry! (convulsing) (grunts) (grunts) 
 
 Dylan! (gasping) Who the hell are you? Oh. Oh, god. That's disgusting. Oh, Jesus. I can't believe you are still dumping them in there. Did you wanna go grab the others? Ugh! (sobbing) Thank you. (continues to sob) My parents were in Hawaii with my brother when it happened. I was supposed to go, too. I lied. Said I had a mid-term. I was seeing this guy... (sniffling) I'm sorry. I was never like this before. I was... I keep trying to get it together. But what if I can't? Nothing broken or busted. sh1t. They didn't just push their way in. At least I don't think they did. How many of the others did you give the codes to this door? Well, probably more than I should have. The black kid and the deaf guy... Look, if my bringing them here had anything to do with this I'm sorry. I hate to say this... maybe we should toss 'em out right now while we still have the chance and the fire power. Yeah. Yeah, I hear ya. We gotta protect Sleeping Beauty. (chuckles) I'm not so sure about that. She seems pretty damn good at that on her own. Yeah, how about that, huh? (door opens) What are you, anyway? Why are you here? I'm... I was... I don't know. I don't remember. You don't remember or you don't want to tell me? What happened? Why... where am I? You were an animal last night. Plus, you got bit by one of them and nothing happened. Not yet, anyway. Maybe you're still gonna turn. Who knows? I don't know what you're talking about. Normal people don't react like that, so what does that make you, huh? Seriously, what? Back off. What? Look what happened to Karen. People are dying here because of you. I don't know what happened here. I don't know where I am. I have a daughter, Dylan. That's all I know or care about. I'm sorry but we've all lost a lot while you've been here sleeping. And this whole story of yours is just a little too weird. Back up. Hey, hey. Break it up. Hey, what'd I tell you about this woman? Get your ass outta here! This woman is the reason we were attacked last night. You need to back the hell up and get the hell outta here, now. Go! Christ. Here, I got you some... clothes. Where's my daughter? Where's Dylan? I-If you had a daughter and she's out there, she's... she's dead. I'm sorry but that's just a fact. Hey, look. He's just... he's been here a while and... I don't know what happened to you. The world went to sh1t a couple years ago. Years? We're just all trying to get by. I can help you get outta here. So you can find your daughter. Just give me a chance to figure it out. Axel, the other marine, you know, he's ok, he's just by the book and all that sh1t. I'll help you out. (water running) You don't gotta worry about me, lady. I've seen everything you got for three years. I'm pretty much over you. My name's Vanessa. Ok. Vanessa. Well, we don't got that much water so it makes sense to double up on showers. You know, we turn it off when we're soaping up. That's the rule. So can you tell me? What the hell happened to me? Please. Look, I don't know what happened to you. I didn't even know you had a daughter. We got sent in here to pick up a dead body. Then some volcano goes off in Wyoming, wipes out half the western states. After that people just started killing each other. People did? Yeah, well, it makes you feel like an idiot to call them vampires but they drink blood so, you know, you decide. And so you guys here, you were... Yeah, we got dropped in. Half dozen of us got dumped off. Our orders were to protect you and the doctor, that's all. We were supposed to hold this position until we were relieved. Folks've been calling this thing "the rising". Whatever it is. I don't know. I did my duty. I watched you, I kept the Doc alive after she got bit. That's it. Why me? Why would anybody be interested in me? I figured you'd tell me after you woke up. It's gotta have something to do with this thing though. Has to. I have no idea. I mean, I'm nothing special. Honest. Well, somebody thought you were. Looks like they were right. If anybody knew, it was Doc, but... she said you should have died already. That you were killed, that you weren't, or you couldn't be. I don't know, man. I just watched you. (cocks gun) Let's go. Very slow, very quiet. That's a hell of a way to say thank you, Vanessa. (sighs) (groans) Woah! Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here? Easy, easy, easy. Easy. Shoot me if you want. It's all good. But I'm getting out of this place right now. I don't give a sh1t about what you do to me. You're not gonna get 20 blocks out there by yourself, I promise you. The man's got a point. I'll take my chances. Hey! Just... I'll see if any of the others want to come with me. You and the others, you're just gonna walk past all my booby traps, you're gonna get through all the locks, all that sh1t? Alright, listen, this is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna escort the little lady back to the lab. You get some pants on and join us. Alright, that suits me. Just everybody stay cool. Let's go. You ok? We gotta get some stuff together now. Food, water. We're gonna get outta here. Fine by me. Where are you two heading off to? Hmm? Axel, I'm just helping the lady out. Nobody's going nowhere. Put the gun down. Axel... Now! Come on, Axel! Axel, the mission is over. It's over. Everything. The woman has a daughter. She just wants to find her baby girl. How are you gonna get out the front door? I'm gonna open it for her. Really? The way you did last night? What? Somebody opened the front door, Ted. Somebody disabled those lights, I think it was you. Bullshit, Axel... a bunch of people here had the codes. A bunch of people have the wrong codes because I gave you all the wrong codes. But you knew where I keep the real ones, in my notebook. You're the only one that knows that. Alright. Hell, you got me this time! (fighting grunts) Stop it! Stop it! Why are you doing this, you son of a bitch?! Stop it! Just... stop! (gun shot) (struggling) (groans) (fighting grunts) Ah! Hey! What's going on? Stupid! (out of breath) (birds cawing in distance) I don't care how we do this, but you're coming with me, sweetheart. Is that right? I'm afraid so. Dead or alive, it doesn't really matter. (fighting grunts) (fighting grunts) (fighting grunts) Stop, Axel! I need to hand her over to them. Who? Them. I told them you existed and now I'm gonna show 'em you do. Stop! She's different! They're gonna want to see this. Maybe then they'll leave us alone. They promised me they'd let us go! Stop! Don't you do it, Axel! Don't you do it! If you understood what they did to me, what they did inside of me, you'd know why I was taking her back. And I am taking her back! (fighting grunts) (bone snaps) She's got superpowers now. Great. (gasping) I'm sure this is all a lot to take in right now. Yeah, a little bit. Waking up the way you did, the world having gone to sh1t and everything. I just need to be alone right now, ok? Yeah. Yeah, no, I get that. Well, if you need... to talk or anything, I'll just be out here. No offense, but go off yourself. Understood. Good, then go do it. Hey, you know what lady? I'm just trying to do my job, ok? Just trying my very best to protect you! I don't need protecting! Really? Yes. And I will get out of here and find my daughter without your permission. You're gonna try. Are you gonna stop me? I have to. You know that. Do what you gotta do. ("You Are My Sunshine" by Gene Autry) ♪ You are my sunshine ♪

As soon as I tasted her blood, I... I can feel again.
