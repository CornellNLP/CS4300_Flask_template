 Previously on Van Helsing. 
 It's like a dream. 
 Welcome to Eden! 
 It was Gorman. 
 He had a hold of Axel, I had to let go. 
 You shut the door on him? 
 This is where we say good-bye. 
 Remember when I used to tell you about my folks farm. 
 It's not far from here. 
 On the way to Denver. 
 Magdalene, you're three days early. 
 Mica, there are no children here. 
 What's going to happen to that baby? 
 These were promised to me. 
 I was never meant to be human again. 
 Nothing is happening! 
 Stay away or die!! 
 Oh no! 
 [screaming] 
 [growling] 
 Ahhh!!! 
 Nothing. 
 And yet I was told a child was due. 
 My tribute. 
 I collected the child, I promise you. 
 But you lost it. 
 [gasps] 
 [snarling] 
 I was looking forward to that delicacy. 
 [gasping] 
 There is nothing... like the freshly suckled blood... of a newborn. 
 [growling and snarling] 
 The arrangement... has been broken. 
 I did my bidding. 
 Broken by whom? 
 [growling and snarling] 
 [stuttering] 
 [growling] 
 [screaming] 
 No, no, no, no! 
 It was her! 
 It was the woman you're looking for. It was her. 
 And yet you hesitate to tell me. 
 Dmitri seeks her as well. 
 He does not know of my alliance with you. 
 He would have me skinned alive. 
 [growls in rage] 
 And yet you think I will not. 
 Please... I will take you to them. 
 I will show you the path. 
 Tonight we march. 
 [growling] 
 It's not far now. 
 Good. 
 I want us to be out of these woods by the time the sun goes down. 
 This is it. 
 That's the house I grew up in. 
 Wow. 
 It's beautiful. 
 And secluded. 
 Mm-hmm What's the big antenna for? 
 Uh, it could be a radio tower? 
 Susan? 
 I don't know, I haven't... 
 I haven't been here for a while. 
 Hello? 
 Mom? 
 Dad? 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 [flies buzzing] 
 Mom?! 
 Dad?! 
 Mom? 
 That's fresh blood. 
 Dad? 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 [sighs] 
 Damn. 
 It's my mother. 
 You didn't know? 
 She died five years ago. 
 Before the rising. 
 Exactly how long has it been since you've seen or talked to your parents, Susan? 
 I don't wanna talk about it. 
 Maybe we should look for your father. 
 No. 
 No, whatever happened to him, he deserved. 
 [growling in the distance] 
 Back inside. 
 You don't gotta tell me twice. 
 [distant growling] 
 As tempting as it is to sleep in a real bed in a real bedroom, I think we're safer up here. Together. 
 Where we can be defensible, you know? 
 Any objections? 
 Nope, none here. 
 Here it is. 
 It's the gun my father taught me to hunt with. 
 He's probably got ammo stashed up here somewhere. 
 I bet I know where the b*st*rd hid it. 
 Susan, the radio antenna outside. Is it connected to anything? 
 Um, it's new from the last time I was here. 
 I can check the cable where it comes in from the roof in the house. 
 Thanks, Mohamad. 
 Dammit. 
 Susan, that can wait until tomorrow. 
 He used to have the ammo stashed all over the house. 
 Made sure it was never in just one place, you know? 
 He made sure it was all in different places, I have no idea why. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 It's ok. 
 We'll find it, ok? We will. 
 Uh, Susan? 
 Jackpot! 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Susan. 
 [white noise] 
 [laughs] 
 It's got power! 
 What? 
 The windmills probably charge the batteries. 
 My dad was a survivalist nut job. 
 Always joking about preparing for the end of time. 
 He never would have got... 
 [radio] There was, uh, six days worth... told me to leave it there. 
 Hello? Is someone there? Can you hear me? 
 Hm... what? Hello? 
 Is that someone trying to talk? 
 Yes, can you hear me? Hello? 
 Is there someone there? I can only hear clicks. 
 Oh, sh1t. The hand mic's busted. 
 We can only receive, not send. 
 Anyone know Morse Code? 
 Click the mic twice if you can hear me. 
 Worth a try. 
 [clicks mic] 
 Holy sh1t! I don't believe it. 
 I've been yammering for weeks on this thing hoping to hear another human voice. 
 Wait a minute, you're human, right? 
 Click twice for "yes". [clicks mic] Ok, I'll take your word for it. My name's Gordon Orwell. [laughs] Gordo for short. I'm in Salt Lake City. Salt Lake City. I wonder if in Salt Lake City it's... In case you're wondering, it's a disaster. A goddamn vampire-infested cesspool, even worse than the Mormons used to be. That's a joke. [laughs] Uh, yeah. They've pretty much taken over. I'm not staying much longer. I've scammed just about all I can. Met some resistance folks a month back, they said Denver's the place to go. Denver? Mile-high city, above the smog and cloud most days. The last place the bloodsuckers will find themselves. Could be where we stage a counter-attack and finally take the fight to these bastards. Hell yeah. [clicks mic] You agree. Well, yeah. You know what they say, make plans and God laughs. I wish I could hear your voice. It's been a while since I've heard a friendly voice. Fire's getting low, I better sign off, I guess. Gotta recharge the batteries. I'll be up in the morning back assuming I don't blow my brains out tonight. I have an empty bottle of JD and there's clip left in my 45. I hope the night's better to you. Pray for sun. Gordo out. [radio static] [spits] [sobbing] [laughs] Woah. Look at you, man! Lookin' good. You got change? Feels good. [laughs] It does. I think we could all use a change just about now, huh? Oh yeah, I agree. So, where to next? Why even ask? We can stay here. What? Look, Susan, I-I gotta go to Denver. If there's a chance that Dylan's there? I gotta go. Plus, you know what Gordo was saying? About it being high altitude? Maybe the skies are clear there. And I still have to find Sheema. There's a vampire work camp south from here. That's where we got separated. If I get her out maybe we can go to Denver, too. Seriously? We have everything we need here. You guys know the odds outside, and Denver's hundreds of miles away. You're seriously gonna stay here? Yeah, damn right. There's no way anybody would find this place unless they knew about it. [sharp noise outside] Grab your weapons! [noise continues] Something's outside. Woah. Oh my god, it's Strider. She's the horse I learned to ride on. She probably has been staying close to the farm. I can't believe it. She's beautiful. We could kill it. I mean, for food, of course. [growling] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [horse whinnies] No! No, Vanessa, you'll kill her! Do it! [gun shot] No! What are you doing?! Vanessa! I gotta get a clean shot! [growling] Hold up, hold up! [growling] [gun shot] [cocks gun] Wait!! That's my dad! [growling] [thud] 
 
 [door opens] [snarling] Now what? Well, what do we do? What can we do? Sam says maybe Vanessa can bite him, bring him back? I've never bitten any ferals before. The ones that bite me, die. He doesn't look that far gone, right? [intense snarling] Or not. No, I don't want him back. He got what he deserved. The way he treated her? I'm glad my mother died before she saw the world turn to sh1t! [snarling] Enough. I can't take this anymore. Nobody wants him to suffer. I don't have a problem with it. He's the reason I had to leave home. He's the reason I lost touch with my mother. I never told her what he did to me. She never knew. He kept me away. Cut me off. Never told me that she died! I mean, what kind of monster can do that?! [snarling] [snarling continues] If there's any part of the man you used to be in there, then that part can hear me. Then you know you deserve this, even if you hadn't turned. [gun shot] Closure. Holy sh1t. Hey, hold on. Hold on. Hold on, Sam, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Susan might wanna say a few words. I can't find her. Have you seen her? Nope. Will you look inside the house? Sam, woods. I'll check the barn. Hey, Susan? Susan! [barn door opens] Susan? Yeah, don't bother, Sam. I don't need to be a part of it. Sure, have a seat. I'm not good company right now. You wanna know how I am? I feel like I'm just barely hanging on. Like all this, whatever happened here, it's just a reminder of how shitty the world is and how shitty the world was and how everything good can... disappear in an instant. I'm not even talking about my dad. It's just the reality of existing like this. Being hunted. Fighting to survive. The whole exercise. You understand me? Sam? [exhales] Hey, it's gonna be ok. Come here. [sniffles] [sobbing] Wha... wha... wha?!! [gasping] Wha...? [gasping] [scissors snips] [sizzling] We will walk in the sunshine together. And soon. Once we have captured the woman, our blood mixed with hers... You have promised me this for years now, even before we knew of the woman. You promised me... hundreds more years of walking on the earth with my children. Night and day. I wonder if you make these promises... with the knowledge... they are false. Maybe you are simply buying more time. If so, what for? Please... don't lose faith in me. Then explain to me how these promises... become reality. [sizzling] [speaking Romanian] I will. I know the way. Hey, Susan? You in there? Susan? Anything? No sign of her. Yeah, I didn't find her, either. Sam says we should keep looking. Ok. Did you check the stable? What is it? What? No, it's nothing. I'm gonna check the house again. Ok. I'll wait out here in case she comes back. Hey, Susan? You up here? Holy sh1t. Hey, man. I was looking for this. You find Susan? Yeah, I guess so. What's the matter? What, did you find Susan? No, and I don't think we will. Wha... why are you saying that? Um... I really think you guys killed the wrong guy. John is not the killer. What? [stuttering] It's-it's hard to believe, and I wouldn't... unless I saw it with my own eyes... Saw what? He... S-Sam? I killed Susan. No. [sobbing] No! [sobbing] No! [shouting] Noooo!! [panting] [cocks gun] Why? Why did you do it, Sam? It's who I am. Who I've always been. Since I was a boy. Since you were a boy? Yeah. What kind of sick... Wait for me in the house, Mohamad. Woah, woah, woah. What're you gonna do? I'm gonna take Sam for a walk. Straighten things out. Do what you gotta do here. I don't want gun shots attracting ferals to the house. Well, I wanna come. No you don't. Trust me. You need me. You need me to translate. I don't expect much talking. Vanessa, you don't know what'll come up. He might have information that you might need. I can communicate that. He's probably not even really deaf, ok? He's probably been faking it this whole time. What's he saying? What's he saying?! Sam... no man. No. It doesn't matter. I'm not staying here alone. I'm coming with you. You sure about that? Yeah. I'm sure. Ok then. Walk. That's far enough. You know why. This is not about me, Sam. Goddammit! What is he saying? This is bullshit. Sam, shut your mouth. Don't listen to him, Mohamad. Ok? He's a psychopath, and manipulating his victims is part of the thrill. Tell him to close his eyes. Tell him. Tell him to close his eyes, Mohamad. Tell him to close his eyes! Do what you gotta do. Mohamad? Yeah. See what you've done to your friend? To Susan? To me? All I ever do, protect you. No. Everyone you killed trusted you. Susan was weak. You know that is danger. Shut up. Shut up! Tell her! Close your eyes! Tell her! Shut your goddamn eyes! Tell her! Tell her! Tell her the truth! If you don't, I will. Aaaaarrgh! Mohamad! [sobbing] I trusted you, Sam. I trusted you. You broke my heart. You broke my... [coughing] Let's go. What? Leave him here to die. He doesn't deserve a quick death. We're not killers. Karma will take care of the rest. [cries out in agony] Goodbye, Sam. [cries out] [gasping] Mohamad! Mohamad! Mohamad! [gasping] The human resistance is counting on the clearing skies to alter the course of this war. They are waiting to make their next move. And given what is happening, I believe they'll make it soon. They will strike us here in our fortress and they will use the sunlight as their ally and main weapon. That is the logical strategy. But we can reverse this fate with one simple move. We accelerate our work. We double our efforts to find and capture the woman. She is known as someone who can turn us human. But what is never mentioned is her vampiric qualities. Her strength. Her rage. Yet she walks in the sun. She is more like us than human. Therefore, the key to our ability to resist the sun is within her. By doing this we not only find a cure, we remove her as a weapon the resistance may use against us. Give me a legion of your best soldiers. Allow me to purge the human resistance once and for all and capture this woman alive. I will return with your prize. [small laugh] Like the Roman generals returned to Caesar, only to usurp him. I would... I would never. With my armies you can do whatever you like. With Julius so eager to defy me.... you would find a willing ally. No, you will not take these steps. Dmitri, you know me. You will do nothing whatsoever. You will remain here where I can keep my eye on you. But what about the woman? As long as she is out there she remains a threat. As I told you before, that is already being dealt with. [crows cawing] [growling in the distance] [growling continues] [groaning] [cries out] She loved this place. I'm glad she gets to spend eternity here. They're together. Family again. Just you and me now. Yep. [growling] [cries out] [snarling] [cries out in agony] [exhales deeply] It's done. [panting] Where to next? Well, I'm thinking Denver still makes a lot of sense to me. Denver. Huh. Look, I know you still wanna find your sister, and I don't expect you to come with me, ok? Maybe this is where we split up. Uh, yeah, I don't think that's a good idea. We're safer together. We could combine forces. Combine goals. The camp that Sheema's being held at is on the way to Denver. In fact, Dylan might be there. Mohamad. No, seriously. They rounded up people from Seattle to this camp. Kids, too. It could be the only chance you've got... [wailing in the distance] Sam : I can hear you! Is that... [whispers] No, no. We have to go! We got to go! Now!!! I can hear you! [laughter]
