 Previously on Van Helsing: 
 My name is Max by the way, Max Borman. 
 That's her, that's Jennifer. 
 That's my wife. 
 Help, help, help me! 
 Shh! 
 Oh, I love this godamn apocalypse. 
 Ahhhhhh!!! 
 Denver sent us. 
 We are here to awaken Michaela. 
 The great mother of the Sisterhood. 
 Axel, come on! 
 [footsteps] 
 [distant growling and snarling] 
 When did you hear? 
 Excuse me, I... I... I didn't know you werearriving so soon. 
 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you during your beauty regimen. 
 I only take the youth serum as a test subject. 
 You must regret not starting it sooner. 
 I'll ask you again. 
 When did you hear? 
 Word came yesterday morning. 
 And there is no doubt? 
 It was a house fire. 
 She was going by the name of Scarlett Harker. 
 And what about the other twin? 
 Vanessa? 
 We're still looking. 
 She was given over to social services years ago, but- 
 I know how you lost her. 
 I know how you let the mother waltz in and take the two of them. 
 I know how you failed to find them year after year. 
 So what I need to know is did you finally track her? 
 Hmm. 
 I have put up with your incompetence for far too long now. 
 I have done everything in my power. 
 There are other forces at work,as you know. 
 Here's what I know. 
 [choking] 
 We need a Van Helsing to raise the Dark One and you've lost them all. 
 No! 
 That's not true. 
 You're lying! 
 [cries out] 
 I'm telling the truth, I swear. 
 There are more Van Helsings. 
 Or at least there can be. 
 What do you mean by "can be"? 
 I harvested everything I need years ago. 
 I always have a little nest eggset aside. 
 You took the eggs from the twins, but they were just children. 
 No matter the age, the ova are fully formed. 
 Who else knows? 
 No one. 
 Not even them. 
 Line up some military volunteers, male. 
 Virile. 
 I want a variety of seed. 
 And what's left of the Dark One's blood. 
 An heir and a spare. 
 [evil laughter] 
 Where'd you come from? 
 Hey. 
 What're you doing here? 
 Somebody's probably wondering where you are. 
 Is that for me? 
 That's uh... that's really kind of you. 
 Thank you. 
 Does someone here take care of you? 
 -You should probably- -Owen! 
 Owen, get away from him. He could hurt you. 
 Is he yours? 
 Don't ever go back there, okay? 
 Jen! 
 I didn't mean to hurt them. 
 It wasn't me! 
 It was the virus! 
 Just wait. 
 I never meant to hurt them. 
 It wasn't me, it was the virus. 
 You were unhappy before that day. 
 You hated being a husband and father. 
 You blamed me and the kids for wrecking your life every day. 
 You came home and you killed your children because you wanted to. 
 Is he ours? 
 Keep your socks, Violet. 
 I can't do anything for you. 
 You said that before and came through. 
 I- I don't know what happened to the doctor. 
 She was just gone one day when I started shift and I don't ask questions. 
 And Julius? 
 He's gone. 
 Broke out. 
 That's all I know. 
 So, you had the amulet and you let the Van Helsings take it from you. 
 Who was it that let them mutants run wild, polluting the food source? 
 It's time to join the modern world. 
 Leave the coffins and capes behind. 
 Blasphemy. 
 Keeping the traditions is the only road to survival. 
 These so-called daywalkers, they are an abomination. 
 I've created a stable food source. 
 Humans that are resistant to death and injury, who heal from wounds, that we can feed on again and again and again! 
 That taste like sh1t. 
 Oh, you didn't know? 
 Raising the Dark One is the answer to all of our problems. 
 But when the time is right. 
 I don't remember requiring your permission, Michaela, or your presence. 
 Hmm. 
 The Dark One expects us to be there, Bathory. 
 Yes, of course. 
 But we must first hunt downthe Van Helsing and the amulet. 
 The Sisterhood will track them. 
 No. 
 I'll hunt Vanessa. 
 She's mine. 
 No. 
 You will remain here. 
 You're too important to risk andwe need the Van Helsing alive. 
 Be a good little boy. 
 Do as your keeper says. 
 Meow. 
 Besides, do we really wanna draganother Van Helsing back here, kicking and screaming? 
 Although that does sound delightful. 
 What are you hiding? 
 Another scientific nightmare? 
 Not exactly. 
 Let's just call it an ace in the hole. 
 Get up. 
 You've gotta have more than that. 
 Get up! 
 How can this be? 
 I'm a scientist. 
 There are ways. 
 But you've kept her a secret this whole time. 
 Why? 
 It was the best way to protect her. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 Locking it in a cage will keep it safest of all. 
 She's in a cage. 
 She just hasn't noticed till recently. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 The blood of such a warrior will please the Dark One. 
 The sacrifice of a mighty Van Helsing. 
 And a cherished one? 
 [Violet] Get up! 
 [fighting grunts] 
 Get up! 
 To pander to our dear one you risk everything. 
 Selfish and reckless. 
 You made no other? 
 None that survived. 
 Is it aware of its lineage? 
 That there's another Van Helsingout there to be found? 
 Vanessa? 
 Mmm. 
 Violet has no idea. 
 She believes herself to be my adopted daughter. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 Get up! 
 Up! 
 [panting] 
 Thank you for the new trainer but I'd like my old one back. 
 This one's broken. 
 Make sure you get everything. 
 I want these reports and all of those computers. 
 [knocking] 
 Hey. 
 Uh, I'm not interrupting something, am I? 
 Uh, no. 
 Not at all, Violet. 
 I was hoping we could have another one of our chats before I go but um... were you looking for Dr. Carol? 
 Yeah. 
 No. Not really. 
 I mean, I know that she's not here. 
 That my- my dad took her away- 
 Do you know where? 
 [sighs] 
 So why are you here? 
 She was working on something. 
 Something for me, kind of. 
 It's no big deal, I don't- 
 I don't want to interrupt. 
 I'll see you soon. 
 You know where to find me. 
 Violet. 
 I think it's only fair that I give you a heads up. 
 About what? 
 I'm leaving in the morning and I'm taking this evidence with me. 
 Evidence? 
 I've been looking into your father's past project, elements of which have been hidden from us. 
 I won't go into the details, they're too disturbing. 
 Let's just say I'm not sure your father is the man you think he is. 
 What are you talking about? 
 What did you find? 
 I just wanted you to be prepared. 
 I'm gonna call for an enquiry into all of your father's work going back decades. 
 And unfortunately that's gonna impact you, too. 
 [thud] 
 [laughs] 
 You are like a dream come true for a guy like me. 
 [coughs] 
 No food, no water... 
 Argh! 
 And nothin' seems to kill you, does it? 
 Argh! 
 You know, if you just tell me why you're here... 
 I'll ease up. 
 Everything can turn out well. 
 Exactly why are you here? 
 All the time in the world, my friend. 
 All the time in the world. 
 Yee-ahhh! 
 I'm not here to help, I just want simple answers. 
 Look, I'll tell you whatever you need. 
 Thank you. 
 You were a vampire and you're not anymore. 
 That's not possible. 
 I was turned by a... by a Van Helsing. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 No, it's complicated but it... it... it's true, it happened. 
 Is that why you can't die? 
 No, I... I think I can die, it'sjust I heal from most things. 
 I was bitten by something calleda daywalker. 
 So you're still a vampire. 
 No. 
 No, no, no, no, no, that's not true. 
 I'm human. 
 Let me help you! 
 Let me help you get out of here. 
 You and your son. 
 You destroyed my life. 
 And you want me to just trust you? 
 No. 
 No, you don't have to trust me. 
 With another child? 
 I can't have you anywhere near him. 
 Then I'll stay here. 
 Jolene will get you out. 
 You and him. 
 You're right. 
 I was unhappy. 
 I was depressed. 
 I was stupid. 
 I didn't know what I had. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Jen, I'm sorry. 
 He won't leave without you. 
 He said to leave him behind. 
 What? 
 No. 
 No way. 
 We're all getting out of here together. 
 Think of your son. 
 I am. 
 Has he heard from Denver? 
 It's beginning to look like the rumours are right. 
 Everybody's dead and gone. 
 What, you don't believe me? 
 You're the one selling dog sh1t around. 
 Something might have happened in Denver, but it doesn't mean everyone's dead. 
 Yeah, well I face facts. 
 I don't live in a dream world. 
 Neither do I, but I don't kill hope before it's dead. 
 My girlfriend's a survivor. 
 He's in a sh1t mood, FYI. 
 Yeah, what else is new? 
 Look, Jeremy, I need you. 
 I need someone on the inside if we're gonna get a chance to get out of here, and you're as good as dead if you stay behind. 
 He will kill you. 
 You know that, right? 
 Save it for the Warden. 
 [clears throat] Well, there you go. 
 Good as new. 
 Nothing broken, nothing drunk. 
 It's a deal too good to be true. 
 I don't do returns, man. 
 What do you think this is, a Wal-Mart or something? 
 It's not a return, it's a trade. 
 Max is the only one I know that'll fork out for the real stuff. 
 Don't exactly get high-end clientele in there. 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 You got water, right? 
 You can squeeze as many bottlesout of that as you need. 
 Yeah, and end up with a bullet in my head? 
 Even drunks know when they don't get drunk. 
 Pass. 
 Alright, look. 
 I'll sweeten the deal. 
 Seriously? 
 How dry is this tobacco? 
 Does it even stay in the papers? 
 It's all I got, man. 
 I'm in a bit of a jam. 
 Yeah. 
 It's the apocalypse. 
 Everybody's in a jam. 
 And you'll be in an even bigger one if Max finds out you swapped out his liquor. 
 Listen, I... I'm trying to set something right. 
 Something I turned my back on. 
 I just need a little help. 
 -Okay. -Okay. 
 I'll take everything. 
 Plus the boombox in your truck. 
 Fine. 
 Plus all the cassettes. 
 Aaaagh. 
 You're killing me. 
 Guns are clean, ready to go. 
 I'd uh, give up the smokes with all that C4 in there. 
 Yeah, they're all yours. 
 And I want those. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I- I gotta keep these. 
 I need these. 
 That'll cost you then. 
 Kidding. Joke. 
 "Implantation of a fertilized embryo." 
 "Experiment summary." 
 "Two females." 
 "Male military donors." 
 Oh my god. 
 Oh my god. 
 Dad? 
 [Hansen] Well, I told you I had an ace in the hole. 
 [Bathory] I have to hand it to you, I had no idea. 
 [Michaela] Tonight we celebrate. 
 [Sam] We feast. 
 [Hansen] Ah, there's still much to do. 
 Relax for once, Willem. 
 Show your true form. 
 I miss him. 
 Willem. 
 Hmm. Show me. 
 Hm. 
 It's been a long time since someone called me by my real name. 
 It must be exhausting, hiding in this disguise for decades on end. 
 Centuries, actually. 
 And yet I've grown accustomed to being... this. 
 Oh, don't worry. 
 I will stay true to the cause nomatter how personal the costs. 
 [Sam] Be true to oneself. 
 It's my only guiding star. 
 Yes, I can see that. 
 But tonight we celebrate. 
 To the rise of the Dark One. 
 [All] To the rise of the Dark One.

 [sniffing] 
 Yip! 
 Oh, screw that sh1t. 
 Oh. 
 You know, I've been meaning to ask you, how are the mines? 
 Best job I ever had. 
 You are something else. 
 You know that? 
 Used to call what she's got "moxie". 
 What do they call it now? 
 Annoying. 
 [laughs] 
 Heard from Denver yet? 
 No. 
 I have not heard from goddamn Denver because no one can fix the goddamn radio. 
 This guy Jer brought in to fix it used to fix computers for a living. 
 A useful job nowadays, I'm sure. 
 There's a lot of that going around these days. 
 What did you say you did before this, again? 
 International shipping. 
 UPS driver? 
 Drugs. 
 Counterfeit goods, that sort of thing. 
 You know, I'm starting to thinkmaybe Blak-Tek did send you. 
 I told you. 
 They want me to report on you. 
 Keep me alive and you're safe. 
 Hmm. 
 Are you reporting on me right now? 
 How? 
 They haven't even contacted me yet. 
 Yeah, that's what you say. 
 What difference does it make whether I've talked to them or not? 
 Either way I'll cover for you. 
 Or maybe I should just kill you all right now and get the hell out of here. 
 You think you can outrun Blak-Tek? 
 Jesus Christ, man. 
 They've got helicopters, they've got spies everywhere. 
 Mmm. 
 Not where I'm going. 
 Oh. 
 Uh, east, right? 
 Where all the shipments go? 
 You think Blak-Tek are the only ones with spies? 
 I've got spies right in Blak-Tek that'll tell me your story is all bullshit. 
 Ask them then, if you think they'll tell you the truth. 
 What the hell is wrong with you,huh? 
 Get that goddamn thing working,you worthless piece of sh1t! 
 [gunshot] 
 Whew. 
 Jer. 
 Why don't you fix it? 
 I'm not a fixer kinda guy. 
 Well, I told you to find someoneto fix it, you didn't, so now you fix it. 
 I'll fix it. 
 Wow, is there anything you can't do? 
 Seriously, you're like a- like a miracle with an answer to all the questions. 
 You know what? 
 Fine. 
 Fix it. 
 But if you don't have Denver on the other end in, oh, I don't know, an hour, you're dead. 
 Deal. 
 Help him clean up the body, why don't you? 
 Make sure he doesn't bleed on the floor, for Christ's sake. 
 You could have let him just kill me. 
 I need you. 
 Oh, and here I was so touched. 
 I need you to save Phil and his family. 
 Promise me. 
 You can still get out of this. 
 You're their only chance. 
 Get them out. 
 You want us to get him out of here for you, sir? 
 Yeah. 
 Just uh, make sure you don'ttrack any sh1t across the floor, and she stays here. 
 Come, come. 
 You do not have a goddamn clue how to fix that thing, do you? 
 Not a clue. 
 Just wanted to save that guard,get him out of here. 
 Why? 
 You got something for that guy? 
 Still not my type. 
 Well, let's talk about your type. 
 I don't really think I care if you're telling me the truth because you lie like a á*áá*á! 
 And I like that. 
 [laughs] 
 I'd kill you in your sleep the first chance I got. 
 Hey yo, Maxie! 
 Uh... sorry about that. 
 Didn't mean to interrupt. 
 [laughs] 
 Axel! 
 Unbelievable. 
 I got back as quick as I could. 
 Brought you that whisky you were looking for. 
 You are the best. 
 Best ever. 
 Can't wait for you to try it. 
 It's the bomb. 
 What's going on? 
 Quiet! Shut up! 
 What're you doing? 
 I'm getting you out of here. 
 Look, I'm not going anywhere. 
 I'm getting Jennifer and Owen out, too. 
 
 
 
 Listen, if you told him anythingabout my wife I swear to god I'll- 
 Shut up! Shut up! 
 I'm doing it 'cause I promised your friend, Jolene and I can use a guy like you on my side out there. 
 Where is she? 
 She's with the Warden. 
 I promised her I'd get you guys out. 
 It's a nice thought but I'm notgoing anywhere without her. 
 Jesus Christ, just shut up and go! 
 [sniffing] 
 Aaah. 
 You sure you don't want some? 
 Nah, I gotta get some sleep, man. 
 It's been days. 
 Oh, come on, just one more drink, one more. 
 Alright, one more drink. 
 I'll have another. 
 [laughs] 
 Can you believe her? 
 She's got chutzpah. 
 Alright. 
 For you. 
 Here you go. 
 She's been talking sh1t about Denver. 
 Has she, now? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna kill her, I just haven't decided how yet. 
 [quiet beeping] 
 Where are you taking us? 
 Just come with me, go, go. 
 Please don't hurt my son, I'll do whatever. 
 Quick, quick, quick! 
 Axel's truck! Axel's truck! 
 Come on, let's go! 
 I am not going anywhere with him! 
 Okay, then I'll stay. 
 Don't come anywhere near Owen. 
 Look, I'll do whatever you want. 
 I just want you to be safe. 
 I want you to trust me. 
 Come on, please, I need you to trust- 
 Shut up with this sh1t! 
 We don't have time for this, okay? 
 You can fight it out when we're all out of here, okay? 
 Alright? 
 We all have our issues, okay? 
 Come on. 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 We have no time. Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Yeah, I'm gonna leave you all to it. 
 Oh, no. 
 Come on. 
 I gotta get some sleep. 
 Alright, fine. 
 Whatever. 
 Pussy. 
 Hey, you think I could borrow her for a couple hours? 
 Oh, you mean... 
 It's been a while. 
 Ain't no better sleeping pill, you know what I'm saying? 
 If you think for one second I'm going any- 
 Shut the á*áá*á up. 
 [laughs] 
 Oh, atta girl. 
 Come on, don't be a bitch. 
 Do what the man says. 
 I'll see you real soon, okay? 
 Do as the man says. 
 Uh, wait. One more thing. 
 Max, seriously. 
 How is Denver, anyway? 
 You talk to 'em? 
 Denver? 
 I can't get them on the radio. 
 Damn thing's broken. 
 Denver's done, man. 
 Everybody's gone. 
 Blak-Tek wiped the whole place out. 
 á*áá*á. 
 Easy, easy, easy, easy. 
 Wait a minute, you two know each other? 
 [laughs] 
 You need to lay off that blue sh1t, man. 
 Don't tell me what to do. 
 We'll talk about it in the morning. 
 No, no, no, she stays with me. 
 Now you're telling me what to do? 
 You just told me I could have her. 
 Don't á*áá*á with me! 
 [quiet beeping] 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 You hear that? 
 What the hell is that? 
 [beeping] 
 You asshole. 
 [gunshot] 
 Or you could just do that. 
 Come on, we gotta go. 
 Go, go, go! Go! 
 [beeping] 
 Holy sh1t! 
 Take what you need. 
 Is there anyone else here that can help us? 
 Some guards, all the prisoners. 
 Alright. Get them quickly, quietly. 
 Everybody down, now! Now! 
 [explosion] 
 [alarm wailing] 
 You alright? You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, so that was the distraction. 
 I see you found the guns already. 
 You blew up the Warden's office? 
 Uh, and the Warden. 
 Not before she shot him, though. 
 You are a á*áá*á badass. 
 Only when I have to be. 
 Alright, let's go. 
 We'll take the truck, blast right through the gates, alright? 
 What's going on? 
 Get back in the barracks! 
 Woah, woah, woah. 
 The Warden's dead. 
 It's over. 
 Let 'em go. 
 There you go. 
 Come on, come on. Everybody, let's go. 
 Flesh, I want you in the front with me in case we take fire. 
 Everybody else to the back of the truck, alright? 
 Let's go! 
 Come on! 
 No! No! 
 [growling] 
 I thought you said you shot him. 
 I did. 
 Get away from him! 
 No, don't hurt him! 
 Hi! 
 Surprised to see me? 
 You could say that. 
 Ahhhh! 
 Yeah, surprise, surprise. 
 Oh, my god! 
 What do you want? 
 I want the truck and him. 
 No. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Take- take me instead. 
 I'll pass, thanks. 
 [Axel] What do you need the kid for? 
 Take me. 
 You shot me in the á*áá*á- 
 You shot me in the á*áá*á head. 
 Sorry, little guy. 
 Calm down. 
 -No. -Hey. 
 You know what, actually? 
 Jer, you mind turning on that Jeep for me and then walking away with yourhands where I can see them? 
 No, please don't take him, please. 
 No, no, no. 
 We'll find you. 
 We'll hunt you down. 
 Yeah? 
 You. 
 Get in the car. 
 No. 
 No, no, no, no, no! 
 No! No! 
 Do what you said and find us. 
 Now. 
 A-ba-ba-ba, with the kid, with the gun, yeah, go. 
 Bye. 
 You. 
 Follow me, they both die. 
 Yeah, I just gotta know. 
 That Blak-Tek story, is that bullshit? 
 Every single word. 
 [gunshot] 
 á*áá*á! 
 I'm okay. 
 [humming] 
 Squirrelly little prick is gone. 
 I told you, he's going east. 
 That's where all his trucks went with supplies, with prisoners. 
 He's got something else going on out there. 
 We go after him, right? 
 Yeah. 
 That thing you told Max about Denver, are you sure it's true? 
 Ninety percent of that city got wiped out. 
 Any survivors are long gone. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Ninety percent isn't everyone. 
 Doc's made it through worse. 
 Then I'm...I'm- 
 I'm staying there, back at Loveland. 
 If Sarah survived- 
 You know she did, she's a survivor, right? 
 You got that right. 
 Then she'll be waiting for me back at the prison, right? 
 And those people, they need my help, so... 
 Do what you need to do. 
 Okay. 
 You get him, Phil. 
 Bring 'em back. 
 Well, I'm not an idiot. 
 I'm sticking with you, badass. 
 Be safe. 
 Move fast. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 I'm not stopping till I find 'em. 
 You know that, right? 
 Damn straight. 
 No. 
 I know I had my doubts but I'll be the first to tell you I was completely wrong. 
 Hansen's doing a wonderful job. 
 I'd stake my reputation on it. 
 If anyone can get us through this plague it's him. 
 Thank you, ma'am. 
 I'll be sure to pass on your encouragement. 
 Well done. 
 Your party tricks have some use at last. 
 I will take that as a compliment. 
 I'll write Avery's official report. 
 Make sure there's no moreinterruptions from the council. 
 Now, about your Van Helsing. 
 We need to find a more appropriate way of storing her. 
 Yeah. 
 Sadly, I must agree. 
 Leave the amulet to the Sisterhood. 
 We will retrieve it and disposeof the vampire hunters. 
 Alone? 
 I do not think so. 
 We will both go. 
 Where's Sam? 
 It's real gold. 
 The stone is real, too. 
 You're Hansen's daughter, right? 
 I don't want any trouble. 
 Hey. 
 I just wanna- 
 I wasn't gonna give it to you, anyway.
