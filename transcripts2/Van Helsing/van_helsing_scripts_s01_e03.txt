 Previously on  Van Helsing. 
 Wendy! 
 Get your ass inside now! 
 My wife is out there. I thought she got in. 
 There is nothing I can do about that, I'm sorry. 
 Is that the Doc? 
 It happened right when you and the boys had it out. 
 One of them got a hold of her. 
 There's got to be a way to fix this thing, right? 
 (Roars) 
 I have a daughter, Dylan. 
 That is all I know or care about. 
 Hello? 
 Mommy, you can't leave me. 
 Please, no! 
 He was one of them, I saw him! 
 Goddamn feeders. 
 Check his eyes, bro. 
 They're frickin' human. 
 (Winces in pain) 
 (sirens outside) 
 Oh sh1t, what's going on? 
 What is that? 
 What's all the noise about? 
 (Sirens continue) 
 (horn honks) 
 Hey! 
 Hey, buddy! 
 You gotta stay inside. 
 Not anymore, I don't. 
 Aagh! 
 (Screams) 
 Hey, excuse me. 
 Excuse me, what the hell is going on? 
 (Growls) 
 Honey, is that you? 
 Daddy! 
 (Low growls) 
 So, like... there's this crazy Ninja thing and then just rams the knife in her hand through Ted's head. 
 She rips it off and then takes the knife, takes the... 
 Oh yeah, after taking the knife out of her hand she just rapidly heals like the wound was not even there. 
 Like nothing ever happened. 
 (Man's Voice): Hello?! 
 Anybody there? 
 Anybody? Did you hear that? Yeah. Hello? Anybody! Hello? Anybody there? Anybody? Hello? Please help me. Please, please, please. Who are you? What's going on? Who are you people? Take your goddamn clothes off. Now. Now! I don't care what your eyes look like now. You're one of them. How can you even live with yourself? Huh? After drinking human blood. Who says I can? I don't know what the hell he thinks I did. He was a feeder and now he's not. That doesn't happen, just so you know. It wasn't me. Maybe it was something down that shaft. I threw a lot of bodies down that shaft. Nothing's ever come back up. There's nothing special about me, ok? I'm way below special. I haven't been protecting you for three years because you're not special! Look. Doc said your body was... acting differently. I don't know, maybe you're um... (screaming outside) (growling) (screaming) Jesus Christ. John! John! Wendy! Wendy! sh1t, it's his goddamn wife. (Growling) No! (Whipping begins) We'll stop when you give us the dead girl. Give her over. Back off. I'm going. No! Vanessa! I have to go down there. (Groans) Wait you're not going anywhere. Stop! I got her! I'll trade! Back away from her! Now! I've got her! I'll throw her over! No! Alive! Nooooo! (Gun shot) (screams) You killed her, you b*st*rd! (Groaning) Your wife was dead the second you lost track of her out there! You left her behind. That's on you. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! Nooooo! That's great. We now have three hours to live. You were one of them? And they want me? They told me to turn the dead girl. That's all I know. I don't get it, first the hand, now this! Shhh! (Screeching) Three hours? Yeah. Turbine charged the car batteries, car batteries kept the UV lights running and skin-frying is our primary source of defense. So when the batteries die... So do we. There's a generator down in the basement. It's been out of commission for a year. I know where to get some parts but it's not going to be pretty. How come you didn't shoot those things down there? At least try and save that woman? It's a waste of ammo. They just keep coming. I don't fall for bait. Not anymore. Anyway, if I'm not back by the time the UV lights go down... (sighs) It was nice staring at your naked body for three years. I'm coming with you. Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're not. It's safer that way. You promise you're gonna stick close? You're not gonna try and take off? One trip out there, you're gonna realize there's no way your daughter survived. It's not possible, not in this world. No one goes in, no one goes out. And no one hurts Doc. And keep an eye on that other guy, make sure he doesn't go postal. Oh, the feeder dude? His name's Flesh. Oh, sorry. Ex-feeder dude. How'd he get a tag like "Flesh"? I didn't wanna go there but I guess he's keeping it. You know how to use this thing? Yep. Now watch out for John, he's an asshole. If you screw this up I will hunt you. No one hurts Doc. Got it. Once we get down below street level we're outside the safe zone. You gotta keep your head on a swivel 'cause down there, trust me, you can run into anything. Here, take this. Get them in the heart, get them on the ground, get their heads off. It's the only way you can make sure they're not gonna heal up and circle back. Wait, they-they heal up that fast? Kinda like you. You set? Yeah. Let's go. Welcome to the sub-basement. Are you sure you know where you're going? It's been a while. I'm more of a stay-home kinda guy. Is that your excuse for watching over me all those years? Most guys would have left. I'm a marine. It was my duty. You think that's lame? No. Somebody thought you were important. It sure looks that way now. I don't want anything to do with this. I'm pretty sure none of us do. What happened to you, anyway? The night you came in Doc says you were stabbed beaten up, pretty much totally bled out. I don't remember. Oh yeah. Shhh. (Whispers) Is that them? (Growling) (whispers) Follow me, run! Run! Move! Move! (Growling) So, watch for the tunnels. Stay close, watch the corners. Should be ok as long as we stay out of the shadows. So-called Resistance. They're fighting back? Hope does all kinds of bullshit to people's minds. Come on, let's go! (Yelling, terrified) Jesus Christ almighty! (Anxious shrieking) Why me? 
 
 Hey. You ok? (Anxious growling) I had a nightmare. I haven't dreamt in years. (Anxious growling) (door rattles) Is it weird? You know, being normal again. (Shrieking) Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! (Screaming) You heard me! Shut up! (Screaming) I say we kill them both before the boy scout gets back. Let's do this. Touch them and you'll end up down the chute like the rest of the people the marines killed. Is that a threat? Are you threatening me? No, just pointing out the obvious. What was that? What'd he say? The first year and a half I ran everything off that generator. Scavenged every spare part for ten square blocks, nearly died every time. Turned me right off the combustion engine. Feeders fed off the passengers. Rats fed off whatever was left. Ferals fed off the rats. Ferals? It's crazy. They'll suck anything. Not much human left in them. The bad news is, engine's down there. They can't be down there, right? Under water? I've seen different kinds. Not proper ferals or feeders, but other things. We better move. Here, take this. If I tug on it, you take off. I don't want you messing with whatever's got a hold on me down there, ok? And here. Safety's off, watch your toes. Whew! Back in 90 seconds. (Snarling) Oh, sh1t. Axel. Axel! Come on. (Snarling) sh1t! (Gunfire) Come on! (Growling) (gunfire) (snarling) Come on! Had to fight the engine for it, and you? They're here! Don't hesitate, just kill! (Screams) (screams) Is it dead?! Is it dead?! Yeah, you killed it! Me? You're the one that should be dead. Are you sure you're alright? That really used to be a normal person? Listen, we gotta get outta here. Let's go. Come on. You are not seriously thinking of ditching on me. Listen, you got some skills, I'll give you that, but look at you. You're spent. I can hold my own. Yeah, against one or two. What if it's five or ten? I have to find Dylan. You're not gonna do her any good if you're dead. What'll you do, huh? If those things are already in back at the hospital? You gonna hand me over? No. Half the people back there want to. They can all kiss my ass. Listen to me. No matter what happens, I stick with you. You got me? Ok, come on, come on, come on, we gotta go. Thank you. Soup's up. That's it. We're all going to die. (Growling) (feeders attacking outside) Grab your sh1t. Grab your sh1t! Let's go. Now. Go, go, go, go. Go! Go! (Attacking continues outside) They're coming. (Growling) Woah, woah, woah, woah, wait. They'll kill them all. Yeah, yeah. Hold back a sec. Hold back a sec. Nikolai! Recognize me? What the hell is he doing? (Growling) I bleed. I'm human. The dead woman turned me. She turned me back. (Growling) Touch me. Come on. Come on. Take a bite. You wanna feel again? To suffer for the blood you drank? Then come inside. The dead woman will turn you. She'll turn you all. (Low growl) Ok, let's go. ♪ ♪ Dylan's dead, isn't she? After what I saw today, she must be. It's just the world now. Those blood-suckers aren't gonna stay scared off for long. I gotta get that generator back up. Hey. She might have made it. I mean, I did, right? (Doc hissing) What am I? Do you know? What did you say to her? You're one of them, aren't you? (Cries out) (chuckling) Why'd you risk your life like that out there? For them? Because most of them want both of us dead. Do you just wanna die? Or were you trying to make some big statement about how I'm the answer to everything just to rile them up? Because I don't wanna be anyone's answer to anything. I got my own sh1t to take care of, and I don't need you pushing me at these people as some saviour or destroyer or whatever. I ripped the throat out of my little girl as soon as I turned. She was five. And my wife tried to save the baby, but I reached in and I pulled his heart right out of his chest, right in her arms. But I didn't kill her. I left her there with them. Pieces of her children all around her. You're right. You deserve to die. And I will. But on my terms. For them. If I found my wife and she was one of them could you turn her back? How do I know? You sure she'd even want to? For a world like this? Because you don't feel when you're one of them. No guilt for anything. You live in darkness. Pain is better. Misery is better. She'd want to turn back. We ran into a little bit of trouble. But the UV light's back up. Hey, uh... can I talk to you for a sec? I've got a favor to ask ya. A big one. It's about Doc. You don't even know, if that ain't work. It's her only shot. She could die. You saw what happened to that feral. Yeah, and I saw what happened to Flesh. Look, she's probably gonna die anyway the way things are going. I have kept her safe this long, but... eventually I am gonna have to kill her. Please. Open the cage. (Growling and snarling) (growling and snarling) Come on, Doc. Come on! Come on, go ahead and bite her. Just bite her and get it over with, one way or the other. (Growling) (cries out) Bite me! What the hell is this? Stay back! Come on, it's right there! (Grunting) (screams) Doc? Doc? Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, Doc. Doc? Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, baby. Come on. Come on, Doc. Talk to me. (Screaming) (hissing) (screaming) (slurping sounds) (screaming continues) (growling and snarling) Julius... Flesh is... human. Says she turned him. Says she'll turn us all. Send word to Dmitri now. He needs to hear this. Come on, Doc. Don't leave me! Come on. Come on, Doc. Don't go. Come on. Throw her down the chute. Shut the frick up! Did she try to turn her? Yeah. Is she dead? I don't know, man. Lasted a long time though, didn't we? You saved my life, Doc. Should have let me save you. You know? You should have let me save you. (Coughing) Woah, woah, woah. Hey. Hey. Hey. (Coughing) You ok? Come on, let's get you up. Let's get you up. ♪ ♪ 
♪ And when I die ♪ 
♪ And when I'm dead ♪ 
♪ Dead and gone ♪ 
♪ There'll be one child born ♪
