 Previously on  Van Helsing. 
 I got this female DB and when I checked her blood it was acting like it was still alive. 
 I am not supposed to talk about it. 
 Jesus, Grace! I am your sister. 
 It's classified. 
 You are a traitor. 
 I didn't know. 
 (fighting grunts) 
 Now, you'll lead me to the others. 
 We got trouble. 
 (loud bellowing scream) 
 Aaargh! 
 (gunfire) 
 A vampire tooth. 
 It must have been what was poisoning her. 
 Dmitri's death squad, the "Elite". 
 Hand the woman to me! 
 It's time to abandon ship. 
 Guys! Guys! Guys! 
 Wait for me! 
 (bird chirping) 
 Pretty little thing, isn't she? 
 Do you like this place? 
 Um... it's been a long time since I slept in a bed like that. 
 Not since... before. 
 It can be yours now. 
 If you want. 
 Your life can be good. 
 Or not. 
 Let me show you. 
 (screaming in pain) 
 So many of them. 
 Are they human? 
 I mean, they look like it, but... 
 (screaming) 
 Almost there. 
 Stay with me! Stay with me!! 
 (screaming) 
 We ourselves cannot give birth. 
 (screaming in pain) 
 With a bite, I can give centuries of life but I cannot create it. 
 Not yet. 
 Keep pushing! 
 Bear down! 
 (screaming) 
 We did... everything we could. 
 Our calculations must have been... 
 (growling) 
 (stuttering) Please... please don't... please. 
 Please. No. 
 No, no! 
 No! 
 No! 
 (screaming) 
 Please! 
 What happens to the mother? 
 Like the others, she becomes a feedbag. 
 I grow tired of your failures. 
 (groans) 
 I'll try again. 
 (winces) 
 I can learn from this. 
 Please... 
 (gasps) 
 You won't disappoint me like that, will you? 
 No. Never. 
 Do my bidding or I'm sure you'll make an excellent vessel. 
 I'm just stating the obvious, ok? 
 It doesn't need to turn into some big thing between us. 
 It's a bit of a bitch when you put it the way you do. 
 What way? 
 You mean the truth? 
 Yeah, something like that. 
 Look, it's pretty simple, ok? 
 If we make it to the base and it's still up and running I might not make it out alive. 
 Who knows what they wanted me for before you got stuck with me? 
 Hell if I know. 
 It's gotta be a cure though, right? 
 I mean, they had to think that you were gonna help with this mess somehow or they wouldn't have committed so much manpower to keeping you alive. 
 And I never felt "stuck" with you, for what it's worth. 
 Axel. 
 You know what I'm saying. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 I hear you. 
 (laughing) 
 (coughing) 
 (peeing) 
 (laughing) 
 (bell tolls) 
 What the hell was that? 
 (bell continues tolling) 
 Bells, bells. 
 (peeing) 
 What the hell?! 
 (chuckles) Sorry, I... 
 John?! 
 Sorry, I... 
 What, you're trying to sneak a peek? 
 No, no, no, no. I just wanted to do what you're doing. 
 I- I wouldn't... 
 I don't mean to be intrusive. 
 I wouldn't do that. 
 Yeah, sure. Whatever. 
 Alright, well... 
 (exhales) 
 It has to be something. 
 They don't make that sound on their own, they just don't. 
 You ever heard of wind? 
 Wind?! 
 Does it feel like there's a hurricane around here somewhere? 
 A little wind isn't gonna push around church bells. 
 It's impossible. 
 Shh, listen. Listen. 
 (bells continue to toll) 
 Ok, so there's a church. 
 And people are there. 
 What good does that do us? 
 It's other people. 
 People we can make contact with. 
 Other people? 
 Like people laying a trap. 
 Our mission is to get to the base, not wander around in the woods looking for god knows what. 
 From who?! Who gave you this mission?! 
 I thought you were supposed to be taking care of the hospital. 
 You're supposed to be taking care of these two... 
 I'm a marine, asshole. 
 I know what I'm supposed to do. 
 You're making sh1t up as you go... 
 Once we evacuated the hospital! 
 It got overrun, we almost died. 
 Yeah, whatever. 
 Ok, I need to get this woman to the base. 
 This is my vehicle, that's what I'm gonna do. 
 How do we know that the base is still there? 
 I mean, how do we know? 
 Look, if we get there and there's no one then we can go chasing church bells. 
 Ok? It'll be great. 
 Fine. It doesn't matter. 
 What do you think, Vanessa? 
 (sighs) 
 I think we need to make a decision. 
 What about a vote? 
 Well, if my vote means anything my sister used to work at the base as well. 
 I'm pretty sure she's the one who sent you in to begin with. 
 Wait, your sister sent the marines? 
 Something like that. 
 As soon as I told her about you, yes. 
 I say we go there. 
 Check it out. 
 I thought we were putting it to a vote? 
 End of discussion, I guess. 
 (low growling) 
 (gunshot) 
 Is this it? 
 Yeah. 
 Now what? 
 Now we walk. 
 Walk? 
 Why the hell would we walk? 
 We've got no choice. 
 Does it look like Juan is gonna make it through that mess up there? 
 Why would we get out of the vehicle? 
 We got a perfectly good... 
 This isn't a military vehicle. 
 She's not gonna get through that sh1t out there. 
 We gotta protect her for later. 
 Come on, people. Let's go. 
 You ok? 
 I'll make it. 
 It's about a half mile to the base. 
 Everybody stick close, watch each other's six. 
 Get down! 
 (gunfire) 
 (explosion) 
 What the hell was that? 
 Land mines. 
 Great. 
 Must have been some kind of last ditch effort to protect the place. 
 We never had land mines around the perimeter before. 
 (distant gunshot) 
 We need to move. 
 Copy that. Better get to the base, hope for the best. 
 We could have stayed inside the vehicle, hunkered down and waited like I said. 
 And then what? 
 Or we could keep walking. 
 Well, unless you sprouted wings reading that Jesus book of yours, walking is the best way in, big guy. 
 You've got to be kidding me? 
 (bells toll in the distance) 
 (explosion in the distance) 
 Split up I guess, I will stay with you. 
 Stay close, boys and girls. 
 This is gonna have to be home tonight. 
 How you doin', old girl? 
 I missed you. 
 Hey. 
 It's the best one I could find. 
 Thank you. 
 Need anything else? 
 No. 
 There's not much in the way of food but I got one of those little fruit cocktail thingies. 
 It's got the cherries in it. 
 No. 
 The good kind. 
 No, it's ok. I mean, with the others, I don't want to eat a whole can by myself. 
 I'm just saying if you twisted my rubber arm I might share it with you, that's all. 
 Maybe later. 
 How's it look? 
 Good. 
 Like the old you. 
 I look old? 
 (laughs) Shut up! 
 Let me see those. 
 Alright, y'all. 
 I got first watch. 
 Good night, Van. 
 Who am I kiddin'? 
 I got all the goddamn watches. 
 (explosion outside) 
 What the hell was that? 
 You know what it was. 
 (cocks gun) 
 Ok, ok, ok. 
 (explosion outside) 
 Yeah, but there's no bodies up here. 
 That we can see, anyway. 
 No fires, nothin'. 
 So what does that mean? 
 So there's nothing to suggest the place was overrun or whatever so what the hell happened to everybody? 
 What does it matter? 
 There's nobody here. 
 I'm just sayin'. 
 Saying what? 
 Say it. 
 Nothing. 
 Exactly. 
 Maybe they'll be back. 
 Why would you think that? 
 I don't know, maybe they're off fighting somewhere and then they'll come back eventually. 
 Surely they would leave somebody here if that were the case, right? 
 Not necessarily. 
 Well, why wouldn't they? 
 With all this stuff here? 
 Of course they would. 
 People died here, I can feel it. 
 Oh, that's great. Thanks. 
 You win the creepy story of the morning award. 
 Don't turn away, John. 
 If you have something to say then why don't you say it to my face? 
 You're creepy. 
 (laughs) 
 (laughing) 
 (door opens) 
 Hey, hey. 
 Where you been? 
 Oh, you know, the few, the proud, the insomniacs. 
 Checking the perimeter, seeing what's what. 
 Anything? 
 Not yet, just did the outside tour though. 
 Still got the building to take care of. 
 Alright, we should spread out and do it in pairs. 
 It'll be faster that way. 
 Yeah, alright. As long as you stick together. 
 I'm still good doing my own thing. 
 Susan, you go with John. 
 Doc, you're with me. 
 This is my sister's office. 
 (coughing) 
 Oh... Jesus. 
 What the... this is not what I was expecting. 
 Whenever we would Skype it was always from this direction. 
 So this sister of yours... 
 Grace. 
 Grace, right. 
 What does she do, exactly? 
 I'm not entirely sure anymore. 
 Take a guess. 
 Research for the military. 
 Some sort of experimental program. 
 She didn't talk much about it. 
 But you told her about me. 
 Well, I sent in your blood work, she got all weird, next thing I knew the cavalry arrived. 
 She did say something about an advisory coming in from the Pentagon? 
 Something about this, it... it doesn't add up. 
 Oh my god. 
 I gave this to her. 
 Funny how a little thing like this survives. 
 (sighs) 
 Unidentified female, Seattle Valley General Hospital. 
 This must be me. 
 Yeah, I sent that in. 
 That's your blood work. 
 This is my file. 
 It's empty. 
 File 281: The Farm. 
 Did your sister every say anything to you about The Farm? 
 No. 
 I'm sorry, I wish I knew more. 
 (explosion outside) 
 We gotta go. 
 Now. 
 (explosion) 
 Clear. 
 (explosion) 
 
 
 
 They're getting closer. 
 sh1t. 
 Clear. 
 (clattering) 
 (whispering) Down there. 
 You go. 
 You go! You got the gun. 
 Come on. 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Don't move! 
 Open the door. 
 Now! 
 No. Not Norman. Gorman. 
 (slams floor with bat) 
 With a G. 
 Is that your first name or your last name? 
 (stammering) Uh, first. 
 Uh... Jones is my last. 
 Gorman Jones, tell us again what you're doing here. 
 Like I said before, I got separated with my group and, you know, we got in a fight with some of them mother suckers. 
 Is that your name for vampires? 
 (laughs) Yeah. 
 Yeah, you know, some people look at me funny when I say it, but the shoe fit. 
 Look, you can call 'em whatever you want. 
 Your group, who are they? 
 The resistance. 
 Part of it, anyhow. 
 The resistance? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 That's a real thing? 
 That's not just a bunch of country boys running around in the woods with some guns playing soldier? 
 Nope. Yeah, no. 
 It's a real thing. 
 Where's your group based? 
 And do you know what happened here? 
 (sighs) 
 We got split up at night and... during the shootin', lit up the night with those uh... tracer fire... 
 I'm pretty sure we saw that. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Well, yeah, I got-I got outta the woods and saw the buildings here... 
 I wasn't sure about this place but I... 
 I hid out here when I heard you guys comin'. 
 So what do you guys think? 
 He's another mouth to feed. 
 He looks like a meat eater to me. 
 I'm just sayin'. 
 Does he look like a vegan to you? 
 For once I agree with John. 
 Me too. 
 We barely have enough to go around. 
 Yeah, well we can't send the guy away because he's hungry, ok? 
 We're gonna have to deal with it. 
 (explosion) 
 That one seemed close. 
 It sounded like it was inside the fences. 
 Yeah, well it's just a matter of time. 
 They're attracted by the sound of the explosions. 
 We need to prepare. 
 Windows, doors... 
 No, no, no. We're not doing that again. 
 We're not-no more booby traps and that sh1t. 
 We can't defend this place. 
 Why not? 
 I used to live here. 
 Look around. 
 We're on the ground floor, there's four entrances, there's a garage door, there's a hundred windows... 
 Then what do you suggest? 
 What about the church bells? 
 Hell yeah, why not? 
 It's worth a try. 
 Sleep here tonight, go back to the vehicle in the morning, get the hell outta here. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 They'll keep coming for us. 
 Julius, Dmitri, Rebecca. 
 It's inevitable. 
 Yeah, well at some point we might be able to bring the fight to them. But in the meantime... 
 It's all the more reason to find these other people and hook up with the resistance. 
 Maybe it's time to split up. 
 If we all go different ways then they can't follow all of us. 
 No! No, no. 
 We're not splitting up. 
 We stick together, we find some place that we can fortify, we hunker down, we ride this thing out. 
 Says you, Axel! 
 What was that, Doc? 
 You don't think these people look like they could use a rest? 
 I'm just saying maybe that's not what everybody wants right now. 
 Maybe some of us have other ideas as to what we wanna do with our lives right now. 
 Such as? 
 I don't-I'm just saying! 
 Look, I'm just trying to keep you people safe, and that includes you, Doc. 
 Until we know where we're going or what we're doing, we can at least agree to hunker down someplace for a couple of days, yeah? 
 Then what do you suggest? 
 You got a bomb shelter in your back pocket? 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe I do. 
 (hissing) 
 (growling) 
 (hissing) 
 (hissing) 
 (fighting grunts) 
 Don't take everything out of the vehicle just yet until we scope this place out. 
 Just the essentials. 
 This is where we're supposed to hold up and stay safe for a few days? 
 Come on. 
 Yes sir. 
 We're gonna need a bigger bunker for starters. 
 Very funny, asshole. 
 It's underground. 
 They call this place "The Farm", I guess 'cause it's in the middle of the field. 
 That's just the entrance. 
 The Farm? 
 What was it? 
 A research facility, something like that. 
 We used to drop off supplies. 
 Other than that it was off limits. 
 What was it, really? 
 I don't know, Doc. 
 It was scientists and higher ups, people above my pay grade. 
 Are we gonna do this or not? 
 Looks like a mausoleum to me but I'll do what everyone decides. 
 I say we go. 
 Why doesn't it feel safe in the basement to me, Axel? 
 Why is that? 
 Son of a bitch! 
 Probably because you're a dip sh1t that likes to spout off about things you don't know the first thing about! 
 Well, I think I got the door fixed. 
 Back up. 
 Woah! 
 Jesus! 
 Ok. 
 It's goin' there. 
 Ok. 
 Yeah, well I got a... 
 I got a spare right here. 
 (explosion) 
 (coughing) 
 Emergency power's still up. 
 Yeah, well this place doubles as a fall-out shelter. 
 Clear. 
 You mean like uh, tornadoes and uh, sh1t? 
 Yeah, like tornadoes and sh1t. 
 (loud thunderous sound) 
 What was that? 
 (loud thunderous collapse) 
 Woah, woah, woah! 
 We're not getting back through that door. 
 Well, that's inconvenient. 
 Why's that? 
 'Cause this is the only way in or out of this place. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 So much for a few days' rest. 
 Like I said, mausoleum. 
 Yeah. 
 What, you mean like... paintings and sh1t? 
 Alright, everybody have a look around. 
 See what you can find. 
 Hey, you guys, get in here! 
 Guys! 
 Look at all this stuff. 
 (laughs) 
 Real food. 
 Real food. 
 Not just beans. 
 What? 
 Holy crap, look at it all! 
 Beer?! 
 Oh, amazing! 
 (laughs) 
 One way in, no way out. 
 What the hell are you gonna do in here? 
 (laughing) 
 (clears throat) 
 To the fallen. 
 We salute you. 
 (All): To the fallen. 
 To the fallen. 
 And the living. 
 That as well. 
 (starts singing) 
 (starts singing) 
 (laughing) 
 (continues singing) 
 Good singing Sam! 
 (continues singing) 
 (laughing) 
 (continues singing) 
 Whoo! 
 I'm gonna find you. 
 No matter what it takes. 
 I'll uh-I'll take some of that stew if you're done with it there. 
 It's all you, buddy. 
 Thanks, pal. 
 What's up, Doc? 
 Please, just go away. 
 Ok? 
 It's-it's not you! 
 Whatever! 
 The Guess Who isn't American. 
 Yes they were. 
 They wrote that song American Woman. 
 It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. 
 Really? 
 Nope. 
 But neither is Rush, Bachman Turner Overdrive... 
 Bryan Adams... 
 Yeah. 
 Loverboy... 
 Bullshit. 
 No, Loverboy is American. 
 Loverboy-Loverboy is not an American band. 
 Loverboy... Loverboy is my favourite band. 
 That's impossible. 
 Loverboy isn't anybody's favourite band. 
 Well, it's true, they're mine. 
 No. 
 Yeah. 
 They're my favourite band ever. 
 Well, they're a Canadian band. 
 Fine, you win. Whatever. 
 Oh, god. 
 Don't be a sore loser. 
 (laughs) 
 No, I'm not a loser. 
 No, you're the opposite of a loser. 
 That's what I meant. 
 (giggles) 
 That's nice. 
 (laughing) 
 Hmm? 
 No, no. 
 No, no. 
 Stop. Stop! 
 Get off me, please! 
 (slap) 
 (struggling) 
 (starts screaming) 
 What was that? 
 Vanessa!! 
 (screaming continues) 
 Be quiet! 
 What the hell's going on here, huh?! 
 Relax! 
 Relax, people. 
 We were laughing and then kissing... 
 She kissed me... 
 She was kissing me... 
 No, no, no... 
 Yes, you did too! 
 She kissed me! 
 No, that's not true! 
 Yes, you did! 
 We were just... I was... and then you wouldn't... you wouldn't let go of me! 
 You wanted me to! 
 Let go of me, bitch! 
 Don't call me "bitch", bitch. 
 I don't know, what we suppose to do. 
 I don't know. 
 I'd start with castration but I'm probably in the minority. 
 Come on, you gotta be kidding me. 
 Normally we'd kick you out but the new guy blew out the front door. 
 Kick me out for what? What did I do? 
 Sounds good to me. 
 Oh, god. Here we go again! 
 Again? 
 What are you guys talking about? 
 Just stay out of this. 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
 Look at her neck. 
 What? 
 The marks on her neck. 
 What're you talking about? 
 Roger, Cynthia, the way they were killed. 
 What're you saying, Doc? 
 That he's the killer. 
 Are you crazy? 
 What the hell's going on here? 
 Seriously? 
 No, think about it, people. Think about it! 
 I am thinking about it. 
 He was always accusing everybody else. 
 It was always somebody else. 
 Either me or, or Flesh... 
 And then Mohamad. 
 That's 'cause Mohamad's the one who was doing it. 
 Are you guys completely nuts? Stop this. 
 Ok? Stop it, now. 
 And you sided with Brendan! 
 You tried to get all of us killed. 
 No! 
 Jesus Christ! 
 I was trying to kiss her! 
 I was drunk! 
 Your hands were around her throat when I got there, John! 
 Yeah, I was trying to stop her from screaming, that's all! 
 That wasn't me trying to... 
 Trying to what? 
 Kill her! 
 Trying to kill her! 
 I don't want to kill anybody! 
 You tried to kill me a couple of times. 
 That's different. 
 How? 
 How is that different, John? 
 Wanna get his bag? 
 What the... you can't just... 
 Looky here. 
 You've seen that before, so what? 
 It's from the kitchen at the hospital. 
 I recognize the handle. 
 Yeah, there's a reason for that. 
 I don't think I need to explain it. 
 This is the same kind of blade that killed Roger. 
 Serrated edge, slanted tip. 
 Bullshit! Look, I took that from the kitchen for protection! 
 That's it! 
 Oh! 
 What the hell?! 
 It looks like Cynthia's finger. 
 I think that pretty much settles it. 
 Bullshit! That's not mine! 
 All this time it was you, John? 
 All this time it was you?! 
 You blame everybody else, you blamed Mohamad, you blamed me... 
 What's... 
 Axel, think about this. 
 Look at this guy! 
 (bottle smashes) 
 (screams) 
 Drop the gun. 
 Let her go. 
 Drop it! 
 Don't make me do this! 
 Let her go! 
 Drop the gun now! 
 Let her go! et her go! 
 Drop it! 
 Please don't do this... 
 Shut up! 
 Look around where are you going to go?! 
 (bottle smashes on floor) 
 (gasping) 
 (choking) 
 (sobbing) 
 I hope to god we were right.
