 Previously on Van Helsing... 
 [snarling] 
 Go! 
 [machine gun fire] 
 [screaming] 
 They're Ferals. 
 No, not anymore. 
 They're Daywalkers. 
 We don't have enough firepower. 
 We do now. 
 [heavy thudding] 
 Ammo tipped with aluminum silicide. 
 A poison I engineer, made from the same base chemical Blak Tek was using in your repellant. 
 The chemical that repels them could also poison them. 
 This path you have always walked. 
 [gravely] I'll never become an elder. 
 If not you, then him. 
 [growling] Let it be me. 
 So I just need to go back to the lab, get the results of the tests and get out of here, okay? 
 No. I made Scab. 
 I've gotta make this right. 
 I keep them, I kill you. 
 [desperately] Julius! 
 Don't do it. 
 You will end the Dark One. 
 Please don't... 
 [screams in pain] 
 Now you have become Elder. 
 Lily! 
 The Van Helsings end now. 
 What is that hellish beast? 
 A nightmare I have to kill. 
 There is another way, trust me. 
 There is no other way. The Van Helsings end now. 
 [groaning] 
 Is that the sickly sweet smell of Van Helsing blood coursing through your veins? 
 [growls] 
 Your resurrection will be... brief. 
 You said there's another way out of here? 
 Yes, but to use it we must get past him and escape. 
 Oh, there's no escape. 
 Only death. 
 After you. 
 Okay, come on, come on, come on. 
 [screams in pain] 
 Bye. 
 [crashing] 
 [grunting] 
 [metal clanging] 
 You could've stopped me years ago when I was still human. 
 [growls] 
 But then I killed Susan. 
 [roars] 
 Oh, the blood I've spilled since... 
 Since killing her. 
 Your fault! 
 [crash] 
 [groaning] I kill you now, all is forgiven. 
 [grunting] 
 Make me. 
 This darkness is yours. 
 [screaming in agony] 
 My destiny is just beginning... 
 [screaming in agony] 
 As yours ends. 
 [knife slicing] 
 [grunting] 
 In the name of my grandfather, Abraham Van Helsing, I send you to hell! 
 [grunting] 
 [yelling] 
 [dramatic music] 
 [gasps] 
 Stop. 
 You must not. 
 I know the path to the Dark One, but to take it we need a Van Helsing. 
 Destroy that which seeks to destroy us. 
 Your words. 
 One, not both. 
 [quietly] It is my right. 
 No, you will do as I command. 
 [grunts] 
 You don't control me. 
 But I do. 
 Always will. 
 And I too have a destiny, and you will play your part. 
 [hisses] 
 I kill who I wish! 
 I do what I wish! 
 [hisses] No!!! 
 Finally a challenge. 
 [grunts] 
 Death has always been my true companion. 
 No. 
 [growls] 
 We have to go, now. 
 I have always been there by your side. 
 I've only seen you for who you really are, chose you. 
 Drawn to your darkness. 
 Come on. 
 Not back in the maze. 
 Trust me. 
 Why me? 
 Salvation of the Dark One, through you, entwined in you. 
 Through here. 
 This place. 
 My sister. 
 Let me show you what you can become. 
 But first, you must surrender your will to me and do as I say. 
 I've never been a follower. 
 Let me guide you now. 
 Be yours. 
 Until the end. 
 Tell me what I must do. 
 She was here. 
 In the maze? What happened? 
 She died. 
 The amulet. 
 We must hurry. 
 [ominous music] 
 Find the blood amulet and the Van Helsings. 
 Keep one alive. 
 [snarls] 
 We must keep this amulet away from them. 
 If it falls into their hands, we may no longer control our own destiny. 
 This is a dead end. 
 Your eyesight is recovering. 
 How is that possible? 
 If you know of another way out of here, we need to find it now. 
 Here. 
 What are you doing? 
 Attempting to recollect the combination. 
 My mother told me many stories about this place. 
 Including a clue to get out, if I can remember it. 
 So, if you please. 
 Thank you, mother. 
 Let's go, quickly. 
 [tense music] 
 [yelling] Vanessa! 
 If they want this amulet so badly, why don't we just destroy it? 
 We tried. 
 Nothing worked. 
 What?... 
 What year is this? 
 Lily. 
 How long have I been gone? 
 [sighs] 
 More than 100 years. 
 No. 
 How? 
 How did it go this wrong? 
 Come on. 
 Scab. 
 It's me you want. 
 It's me you've always wanted. 
 Just let me kill him for you. 
 Oh. 
 What is that, Scab? 
 You're scared to face me? 
 [snarls] 
 Just like old times, huh? 
 Stronger now than you can imagine. 
 I have become a Sister. 
 Well that's weird. 
 But you know what, Scab? 
 You've always been weak. 
 You have always been a follower and you always will be. 
 Always. 
 And you are a pathetic human, fallen from the heights of what you were. 
 I will bathe in the blood that I tear from your veins! 
 [roars] 
 sh1t. 
 [machine gun fires] 
 [grunting] 
 No match for me. 
 Not anymore. 
 [roars] 
 [crash] 
 You know you talk too much? 
 [grunting] 
 She didn't. 
 Your woman. 
 I sucked the life right out of her. 
 [groans] 
 [dramatic music] 
 [gunfire] 
 [screaming] 
 [grunts] 
 This is for Frankie. 
 This is for my Mom. 
 And I'm sorry I ever made you. 
 [grunting] 
 It worked. 
 It killed them. 
 All right, we gotta get those people out. 
 Let's go! 
 Yes sir. 
 Clear the fence! 
 All right, let's go. 
 Move 'em out! 
 The poison bullets aren't working! 
 They're getting back up! 
 Run! 
 Run!!!!! 
 Move, move, move, move, move! 
 Let's go! 
 Get up. Get up. 
 Get up! 
 [alarm blares] 
 [P.A] This sector has been breached. 
 All citizens must evacuate immediately... 
 [Maddox] I want you to find that doctor, you understand?! 
 I want every square inch of this place searched! 
 You hear me? 
 Find her. 
 To the gate. 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 I got him. 
 Get down. 
 [gunshots] 
 It didn't work. 
 Get behind us! They are coming! 
 The second that path clears, you make a run for that gate as fast as you can. 
 -You got that? -Copy. 
 [gunshots] 
 [grunting] 
 Let's finish this. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [gunshots] 
 Ah, sh1t! 
 [yells] 
 Julius! 
 [screams] 
 No. 
 Make her watch as I finish him. 
 Say it. 
 [panting] 
 Look. 
 Say it. 
 [weakly] Master. 
 [mournful music] 
 [screaming wildly] 
 [heavy explosion] 
 [screeching] 
 [gate rattling] 
 Let us in! 
 Where's Nguyen? 
 He's dead. 
 Just let us in. 
 This sector's not secure. 
 I can't defy orders. 
 You have to let us in! 
 We're here, come on! Let us in! 
 Please let us in! 
 [gasping] 
 [growling] 
 [muttering] 
 I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. 
 Stand back. Stand back! 
 [yells] Stand the áááá down before I blow his brains out. 
 Okay, okay, come on, let's go! 
 [gunfire] 
 [growls] 
 -Doc... -Oh, my god! 
 Doc, you opened the gate. 
 You saved our lives. 
 [laughs] 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Put the weapon down. 
 One second. 
 Check her bag. 
 Where is the report? 
 What report? 
 I know you deleted it. 
 Where's the copy? 
 Oh, okay. 
 You want to play it like that. 
 We'll get the answers, one way or the other. 
 Wait, no, no, wait, wait! 
 She saved our lives. 
 Are you seeing this? 
 Yeah. 
 Take him as well. 
 I'll get to the bottom of this. 
 I promise you that. 
 Ease up, ease up! Where the hell are you taking us? 
 Someplace safe, where we can talk without interruption. 
 Get 'em ready to board. 
 What? 
 You can't just fly away. 
 You made the mess, it's your job to clean it up. 
 They've already taken over half the city. 
 The silicide isn't working on the Daywalkers. 
 We're being overrun. 
 Stay calm, Max. 
 I'm sending reinforcements. 
 [flight announcement] 
 The second we get airborne, deploy the canisters. 
 Canisters? 
 For what? 
 Nerve agent. 
 Weapon of last resort. 
 But that won't do anything to the vampires. 
 Oh, my god. 
 Get 'em out of here. 
 You can't do this! 
 That'll kill everyone else. 
 Get 'em outta here. 
 [yells] Don't do this! 
 [helicopter whirrs] 
 What reinforcements?! 
 [groaning] 
 [agonized yelling] 
 He did this to me! 
 Julian! 
 Rest. 
 Heal. 
 In time, you will have your revenge. 
 I don't think I have the strength... 
 [yelps] 
 Please! 
 I can help you. 
 I know where they went! 
 The only help that you can provide is what pulses through your veins. 
 [growling] 
 [gurgling] 
 We must find them. 
 We need a Van Helsing. 
 Why are we still here? 
 What is this? 
 A pathway forward. 
 The gateway of all we have set in motion. 
 The Dark One? 
 Yes. 
 Points on a black star. 
 We must find the others. 
 Others? 
 In time, you will know everything. 
 Now give me back the blood amulet. 
 No. 
 No, you let them flee with it. 
 If you had let me kill them when I could, you would have the blood now. 
 We must move quickly. 
 Send word. 
 [speaking Latin] 
 Ahhhh!!!!! 
 Return to the beginning! 
 Prepare for the awakening. 
 Mother of your sisters. 
 Bride of my beloved, bear witness and bow down as the darkness consumes the light. 
 [roars] 
 Ivory. 
 Ivory. 
 [panting] 
 I see our path now. 
 Our mother will rise. 
 She will rise. 
 [panting] 
 Who is she? 
 The mother who shall rise? 
 Beloved of the Dark One. 
 The second of three. 
 Teach me everything. 
 I can give you the greatest gift you have ever known. 
 The ability to be more than you ever thought possible. 
 Perhaps to become the Dark One yourself. 
 But your loyalty must remain with me always. 
 Can you make that pact? 
 And in return, I can teach you to be anything you wish, have anything you desire. 
 Would you like that? 
 Yes. 
 Then come, my love. 
 Our fates must become entwined. 
 Drink from me. 
 [snarls] 
 [blood squelching] 
 [radio instructs] All right, clear the LC. We got a hawk coming in... 
 Hansen? 
 Hansen? 
 Hansen, are you even listening to me? 
 Years of effort to take back some of what we lost, to establish a safe city, and now in a matter of hours, Denver has fallen. 
 You have to take account for your actions. 
 I wasn't prepared to allow the vampires to capture it. 
 [slams hands on table] 
 There were thousands of people. 
 Who would've been turned into food, or worse, a growing army of Daywalkers. 
 Would that be more preferable to you? 
 Blak Tek was supposed to be providing solutions. 
 Hope. 
 Now all we have is a greater crisis and a worse enemy. 
 That's on you. 
 With every loss, there are certain gains. 
 Lessons to be learned. 
 What? 
 It takes a few broken eggs to make an omelette? 
 Don't you dare flip the narrative. 
 No, no, that's very good, Miss Avery. 
 Very, very good. 
 In fact, that analogy is kind of perfect. 
 Come on. Get over here. 
 Who the hell are they? 
 Uh, eggs. 
 A Denver omelette, if you will. 
 Blak Tek was supposed to find a cure for this vampire situation. 
 We went through so many amazing things, but in the end the result was... disappointing. 
 That's a hell of an understatement. 
 This goddamn Daywalker virus, it was made by Blak Tek, wasn't it? 
 That rogue Frankenstein operation you were running in the mountains. 
 It was a project that went astray. 
 A project that spawned an epidemic. 
 Mutant vampires that we can't defend against. 
 Or can we? 
 In the jaws of defeat, perhaps there lies victory. 
 But to get there, excuse me. 
 Thank you. 
 A few eggs get broken. 
 [gunfire] 
 [gasps] 
 Thank you. 
 Are you insane? 
 What the hell did you just do? 
 Shh. 
 Wait for it. 
 [groans] 
 What the hell, man? 
 [whispers] That's not possible. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 Get off me! 
 Get off me. 
 All right? 
 I just took a bullet to the ticker, would you relax? 
 That's not possible. 
 It shouldn't be, but it is now. 
 Only Daywalkers can heal from a fatal shot like that. 
 Is... is he? 
 No. 
 But he was a vampire. 
 He was turned back by Vanessa Van Helsing. 
 I've heard of her. 
 Thought maybe it was just a hopeful legend. 
 No, she's real. 
 There's something special in her DNA. 
 It can reverse vampirism. 
 Tell me how. 
 I don't know. 
 But I can help you find answers. 
 We both could. 
 Would you back off, lady? 
 I ain't a freak show. 
 Don't you see what he is? 
 A mutant. 
 [annoyed] Hey. 
 A solution. 
 If I can replicate what's flowing through his veins, make a serum that would allow regular humans to gain this vampire resistance, this rapid self-healing... 
 ...We could make ourselves immune. 
 And the tide would turn. 
 We'd regain the upper hand, and this nightmare would come to an end once and for all. 
 And is this something only you can figure out? 
 Well, with the right motivation, she's capable of anything. 
 [sighs] 
 There's no sign of them. 
 We're safe for now. 
 Too modern? 
 No. It suits you. 
 More than 100 years, trapped, neither dead nor alive, while the world unfolded and fell to pieces. 
 My husband, my daughter, lived and died without me. 
 I never got the chance to... to know my own child. 
 I think she was my great-grandmother. 
 
 
 
 Her strength passed on. 
 Your strength. 
 So you are my... great, great granddaughter? 
 Vanessa. 
 Vanessa. 
 My mother's name. 
 She was a veritable force of nature. 
 [laughs] 
 My family and I, our family, we hunted all the powerful elders. 
 Imprisoned the ones that we found. 
 Their power was thought to be vanquished. 
 And yet, this world outside, that hellish thing in the maze? 
 Sam, or whatever he's become. 
 The fourth elder. 
 Did you play a role in this? 
 I destroyed them all. 
 Abadon, Gabah, even Jacob. 
 Why? 
 Why would you do that? 
 Because I wanted to. 
 I wanted to raise the Dark One to kill it. 
 How? 
 With what knowledge that you could succeed? 
 I wasn't raised like you. 
 Aware of what I was, my role in all this. 
 I learned. 
 I adapted. 
 I made mistakes. 
 How could you be so headstrong? 
 So reckless? 
 Do you understand the gravity of what you've done? 
 The oracle and the fourth elder are on the path now to freeing the Dark One, and it's because of you. 
 Then help me stop them. 
 You said they needed this. 
 For a ritual. 
 There are pages in a book... 
 The Van Helsing book. 
 Yes. 
 Do you have it? 
 It's safe. 
 I can take you to it. 
 Well played. 
 But I want to make something crystal clear. 
 As much as you want to cozy up to Avery, I'm still the gatekeeper. 
 So we're prisoners here until I get results? 
 Cooperate, prove yourself useful, and you'll find your stay here much more comfortable. 
 Look, the kind of work you want me to do- 
 I... I'll give you a full lab. 
 Better than you've ever had, even before the rising. 
 You can give me the whole CDC, what I promised her was a fantasy. 
 No, what you gave her was hope. 
 Surely the data that you got in Denver from that gene sequencer will get you one step closer to the answers. 
 Like I said, what data? 
 Remind me to never play poker with you, Sarah. 
 Why would I do that? 
 Even fools know the house holds all the cards. 
 What about my friend? 
 Your frie... 
 Oh, don't be so sentimental. 
 Come here. 
 Use him as you need to. 
 Doc, Doc, I ain't... I ain't nobody's lab rat. 
 Doc! 
 Doc! 
 [grunts] 
 Back down! Back down! 
 [grunts] 
 Oh, wow. 
 [grunts] 
 [gun clicks] 
 I have got the shot. 
 Stand down. 
 All of you. 
 You're well-trained. 
 Fearless. 
 Lethal. 
 And you're an asshole. 
 Thank you. 
 I was going to have her cut you up into pieces, but instead I think I have a better use for you first. 
 Are you certain? 
 Something this important I wasn't going to leave on that island or take to Renfield House. 
 Safe and sound, see. 
 That's good. 
 Give it to me. 
 Wow. 
 A great deal has been added since I last laid eyes upon it. 
 Your daughter, and eventually my mother, it passed through both their hands. 
 To understand what's at stake, you must know about the ritual. 
 You'll have to cut me. 
 Van Helsing blood reveals the ink. 
 I know. 
 How? 
 Your mother? 
 No. 
 We discovered it ourselves. 
 Me and my sister. 
 She gave her life for yours, didn't she? 
 Oh, Vanessa. 
 It's what we do. 
 We Van Helsings. 
 We protect each other. 
 Keep the family legacy alive. 
 There's no guilt in it. 
 Still, everything I've done, all the people who have died. 
 There's still hope. 
 Let me show you. 
 No. Let me. 
 I heal, remember? 
 A curiosity I still don't understand. 
 [sighs] 
 My grandfather sketched these. 
 It was he who sacrificed himself to entomb the Dark One. 
 He had a plan for the rest of us, that much my grandmother remembered. 
 For years, she told me that there were secrets I was too young to be burdened with. 
 By the time I was old enough, her mind was... gone. 
 She handed me the amulet and said it was up to me now. 
 What was up to you? 
 I don't know. 
 To use it. 
 To destroy it. 
 The truth was lost with her. 
 Did it have anything to do with killing the Dark One? 
 What is this? 
 I believe it is the ceremonial place of Incarnar, the boundary between earth and the shadow realm where the Dark One was exiled. 
 My grandfather told me about these gates. 
 The place he built beyond. 
 And the amulet has something to do with these ceremonies? 
 I believe so. 
 It must, or else... 
 What? 
 Why would grandfather?... 
 [groans] 
 What's wrong? 
 I don't know, I just suddenly feel quite faint. 
 Might we rest a while? 
 What's this about? 
 I think you and I got off on the wrong foot. 
 Yeah, a bullet to the chest? 
 That'll do it. 
 Well, I'd like to make amends. 
 I don't want you to think of yourself as some test subject. 
 [sarcastically] That's reassuring. 
 Oh, but wait. 
 There's a catch, right? 
 You're something quite unique. 
 You can fight, you heal, you're a formidable adversary, but perhaps there's something even more. 
 I ain't no thug. 
 If you're looking for muscle, you can find yourself another stooge. 
 I didn't do it for the mob, and I sure as hell ain't going to do it for you. 
 I'm thinking of something quite... different. 
 The world is a dangerous place, and she's the most precious thing I've ever had. 
 I can't risk anything happening to her. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [groaning] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [screams] 
 Who is she? 
 My daughter. 
 Violet. 
 And you, Julius, are her new sparring partner. 
 -Oh, boy. -Hmm-mmm. 
 It's no use. 
 What do you mean? 
 Without the blood, the amulet's pointless. 
 One would think. 
 Look at it again. 
 How? 
 Some dark enchantment. 
 A mystery we could never understand. 
 [laughs] 
 What is it? 
 The elder Abadon, he sent me into some altered state. 
 I went back to Hong Kong in the past. 
 I was you. 
 [laughs] 
 What was it like? 
 Being me? 
 I learned a lot. 
 About what we're up against, who you are, and who I am. 
 And who are you? 
 There's a part of me I've had to fight. 
 A darkness. 
 It called to me for a while. 
 I almost gave in to it. 
 Whatever happens, you must never surrender to the darkness. 
 Why would it call to you? 
 I was bitten by Abadon. 
 And you survived without turning? 
 How? 
 The darkness consumed Jacob after he was bitten. 
 He became an elder. 
 But... you're still human. 
 I don't think I'm a true Van Helsing like you. 
 Somehow I was made with the blood of the Dark One. 
 How? 
 Your mother? 
 No. 
 Not naturally. 
 By some kind of science. 
 I was an experiment. 
 Who would do such a thing? 
 Why? 
 [snarling and growling] 
 They found us. 
 Stay here. 
 [growling] 
 [sword slicing] 
 [snarling] 
 [grunting] 
 [snarling] 
 [grunting] 
 [grunts] 
 [gasps] Lily! 
 Did it bite you? 
 Uh, no. 
 [laboured breathing] 
 Okay. Just lie back. 
 It's okay. 
 [vomits] 
 What happened to you just now? 
 That vampire? 
 Your eyes? 
 You bit it. 
 I told you I'm not like you. 
 [gasping in pain] 
 Lily. 
 There's nothing that can be done. 
 [groans] 
 [screams] 
 What are you doing? 
 It bites you, you turn and heal. 
 No! 
 No, then I'll become one of them. 
 You saw what I can do. 
 I'll change you back. 
 No. 
 No, no, no. 
 I'll never turn! 
 I'd rather die! 
 Get that thing away from me! 
 It's my time. 
 There's no way to find our path now. 
 No way to the gates and the answers that lie there. 
 No, Lily. 
 Lily, how do I find the gates? 
 What do I do with the amulet? 
 The light has already faded from your eyes. 
 I swear to you, I can fight the darkness. 
 I can find the light. 
 [sighs] 
 [crying] All these centuries of struggle... for nothing. 
 They won't win, Lily. 
 I won't let them. 
 The light isn't dead, but the Dark One will be. 
 I swear.
