 Previously on  Van Helsing. 
 Susan? 
 (fighting grunts) 
 (screams) 
 It's true. 
 Get ready to run! 
 One of ours was killed before you got here. 
 Whoever did it, took a finger, just like this. 
 I remember your scent. 
 Hey! 
 This is only temporary until we find out who the real killer is. 
 I did. 
 I killed those people. 
 We break in through here. 
 We are up and in without them even knowing. 
 Now! 
 (growling and snarling) 
 Fresh meat to the one who brings her to me. 
 (snarling) 
 Run! 
 (gasping) 
 (snarling) 
 Let's go! 
 (vampire shrieks) 
 (vampire shrieks) 
 Get back! 
 sh1t! 
 Come on! 
 (feral snarling) 
 (screaming) 
 (feral snarling) 
 (screams) 
 (screeching) 
 (snarling) 
 (screams) 
 (screams) 
 Vanessa! 
 Vanessa! 
 (choking) 
 Va-Vanessa! 
 Please-Please-Vanessa... please... please, it's me... 
 Susan... Susan... 
 (sobbing) 
 Oh, Susan. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's ok. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's ok. 
 I'm getting us out of here. 
 Ok, sure. 
 Woah! 
 It's ok. 
 It's ok. 
 You rest now. 
 Remember you used to sing this to your little girl. 
 ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star, ♪ 
♪ how I wonder what you are. ♪ 
♪ Up above the world so high, ♪ 
♪ like a diamond in the sky. ♪ 
♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star... ♪ 
 (screeching) 
 I wonder what's in there. 
 I don't know. 
 They told me to stay close to everyone else. 
 You know, it's probably more food. 
 Supplies. 
 All the stuff they didn't want us to find out about before. 
 Gosh. 
 Do you think it's ever going to be the same again? 
 Like, the world I mean. 
 Of course it will be, sweetie. 
 Really? 
 Absolutely. 
 All this bad stuff? 
 It's only temporary. 
 I can feel it. 
 Maybe it's really a toy store with toys and candy and stuff like that! 
 (laughs) 
 Callie! 
 (screams) 
 (starts sobbing) 
 You ok? 
 Can you keep going? 
 Look who's talking. 
 I'm fine. 
 I'd throw you over my shoulder and carry you myself but I'd probably resent your ass for like six months or so. 
 We wouldn't want that. 
 Ok look, these numbers. 
 They correspond to streets. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, my old bus route, remember? 
 Yeah. 
 Downtown is on a grid so if I remember correctly we just... we're close. 
 A few more blocks underground and we should be able to go topside. 
 We could risk it now. 
 But no doubt we're being tracked. 
 We're better off staying underground as long as we can. 
 Yeah. 
 These things down here... 
 I need a minute. 
 Susan, listen. 
 If something happens, ok, if we get split up or whatever and you find Dylan before me, I just... I need you... 
 I need you to tell her that I'm alive. 
 Ok? And that I'm searching for her. 
 And that I will find her. 
 Ok? I will. 
 Ok. 
 But we're gonna get out of here. 
 For Dylan. 
 And you can tell her your damn self. 
 Ok? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 And yes, ok, we never should have taken the keys, ok? 
 I know that, but... come on. 
 Come on! 
 You don't... this guy has booby-trapped the entire hospital and Callie walked right into it! 
 Thank god she's so tiny or she... it-it would have torn her in half. 
 (starts sobbing) 
 I want to know what happened. 
 The hell that you've got going around here. 
 I'm gonna need you to be a bit more specific than that, big guy. 
 (groans) 
 I seriously have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Your stupid traps, asshole. 
 All the sh1t you've hung up and hidden away around here, that's what. 
 Why's that? 
 Because you almost killed a little girl, that's why. 
 Where was this? 
 Why does that matter? 
 Just asking. 
 The south side of the building. 
 The blood bank or whatever it is. 
 Well you ought to teach her to read because I put a sign on the door that clearly says "keep out". 
 You asshole! 
 I got this. 
 I'm gonna need a list of every gadget you've stashed around this place. 
 Why would I do something stupid like that? 
 Because that's the only way a group of people trying to live here can safely go about their daily lives. 
 That is why. 
 You got a pencil? 
 I do. 
 Great. Take it and jam it up your ass. 
 (groans) 
 (moans) 
 You're such a tough guy, but you're gonna tell me in the end anyway. 
 Why, so you can take this place over for good? 
 We already have taken over this place. 
 For good. 
 (groans) 
 Does Taka even know we're doing this? 
 Do you think I would risk being here without telling him? 
 Where is he? 
 He's planning. 
 He's looking at the big picture. 
 All I care about is getting free of here. 
 Of them. 
 Does he have a grand plan about that, too? 
 Look, there's two things I know, Quaid. 
 Number one: I trust Taka with my life. 
 And number two: I know what if I ask too many questions he could end my life like that. 
 You got this? 
 Piece. 
 Of... 
 Cake. 
 Wait. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Send a scout first. 
 They only guard the front, not inside. 
 No, something's wrong. 
 This was your plan in the first place. 
 I'm going. 
 Sweet. 
 Wait. 
 Show me your face. 
 Quaid? 
 Show me your damn face. 
 (hissing) 
 (gunshots) 
 (snarling) 
 (gunshots) 
 It's a trap! 
 Fall back! 
 (gunshots) 
 (low growling) 
 We failed. 
 (stuttering) The sewer beasts got them. 
 The woman must be dead. 
 She must be. 
 (low growling) 
 (starts sobbing) 
 How can you be sure? 
 Hmm? 
 How can you be sure? 
 (stammering) She-she must be... 
 (growling) 
 (bellows in frustration) 
 (continues to bellows) 
 Callie, could you grab me another bowl of soup please while you're up? 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 She's gonna be ok. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm just gonna... 
 I think I need some time to myself. 
 You feel alright? 
 Yeah, fine. 
 I wanna tell you something. 
 Something I've never told you, or anybody else for that matter. 
 I've got a kid. 
 I do. 
 What? 
 I try not to think about it, but... uh, it was when I first, I was young and my dad wanted me to get rid of her but... so I-I was... so I left and ran off. 
 I had this thing but I didn't really know how to... so um, anyhow I just-just so you know, um... 
 I get how you feel because... not a day goes by where I don't think about my baby. 
 Thank you. 
 This is it. 
 The only way this is gonna work is if one of us-gah! 
 Son of a... 
 Oh my god. 
 Hey! 
 How does that feel, you piece of sh1t? 
 Dammit! 
 You like my booby-trap? 
 Huh? Do you? 
 Hey! 
 Do you like how it feels? 
 Do you like how that feels?! Do you like it?! 
 Brendan! 
 Do you like that?! 
 Do you want some?! 
 Somebody help us! 
 Do you like how that feels?!! 
 Do you?!! 
 Aaargh! 
 I'm not done with you! 
 I'm going to destroy you!!!! 
 Somebody help us! 
 Enough! Stop! 
 Now! 
 (screams) 
 I'm gonna kill you. 
 I'm gonna kill you! 
 Stop! 
 You're dead! 
 Stop! Stop!! 
 I understand how you feel, I do. 
 But this is not how we do things. 
 Go cool off, now! 
 Now. 
 Is that how you control your people? 
 I'm sorry, this is not the way we operate. 
 Oh yeah, except for my little hallway beating. 
 This won't happen again. 
 Oh, good. I feel so much better. 
 I promise you. 
 I know it's not gonna happen again because if any of your people come at me like that again I'm gonna kill 'em. 
 You might wanna go tell them that. 
 Here, let me take a look at that. 
 You eavesdropping with that thing? 
 Is that what that is? 
 You always carry that around? 
 Hey. 
 What're they saying? 
 (whispering) 
 Come on. 
 Come on. They're going to execute us. All of us. Come on. Almost there. Oh god, that thing down there that bit me Something's not right. sh1t. It's ok, there's a doctor in there. We just gotta get back in. The door code is 1936. 1936. I hope. (growling) sh1t. We gotta go. (ferals growling) (growling) Damn, it's really starting to hurt. You said you normally heal faster than this. Yeah, I don't know, since I woke up I have been able to. That thing down there was different. This bite is getting worse. What about this doctor and the others? Are you sure you can trust these people? I hope so. At least for now. Holy sh1t, you made it back! Yeah, just. How? And who's this? It doesn't matter. I'm her friend. Where's Doc? She needs a doctor, now. Go get the doctor. I'll take these two to the cafeteria. Go. The cafeteria, why? It's closer. Come on. Doc, we need you. Now, please. What're you guys trying to pull? They banished Mohamad? Why? Then they stabbed Axel and now they want to get rid of us. What? Sam read their lips. They're gonna execute us. Hey, how're you doing? Hey. I sacrificed myself for you and this is how you repay me? You-you lock my people up, you attack them? It's just temporary, believe me. Just until we know that we exiled the right one. Look, one of them is a murderer. It's a fact. Mohamad took the blame so we sent him away. Bullshit. That kid would never... Look, it doesn't matter. Someone did it. We're trying to figure out who. Fine. I'll stay out of it. I'll be friggin Switzerland as far as your concerned. Ok? Just leave Susan alone. I'll be on my way when I'm better. Understood. Obviously you'll be free to go when you've recovered, so... You're gonna leave us? What do you think? I think I can count on you. Good. 
 
 Fill me in. We're doing our best. There's a grate in the ceiling. We're trying to get one of us through it. Good. That's good. You do that. I got a message for Axel. Susan, you can help with this, too. (whispering) What do we do now? We can't keep them locked up here forever. You're right. Axel's the problem. We separate him, maybe we can get to the truth. sh1t. How dare you?! Who are you to talk to me that way? Huh? Back off! I said back off! You bitch! You bitch! You're just like these assholes! Put that thing down or I will stab you in the throat, bitch! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! (screaming) Escort the doctor back to the others! Hey, you stay here with Vanessa. Uh, she said "Switzerland". Remember? So give us some space. Oh, and we're both gonna need some new clothes. You got that? What happened? Vanessa's back. She made it somehow, but... She's alive? Yes, but very injured. Now, listen. She has a plan. She says you need to try and get out. If you can catch Brendan off-guard then somehow secure the doors on both ends of the wing they can take out whoever is left on the other side. Who are "they"? She-she brought in some woman, some Susan chick. Anyway, she said "take out the generator". She wants me to get them in the dark. Get them disoriented, get the advantage. I'm in. I'll do the lights. You? It's better than facing a firing squad at dawn. Why not me? You can't do both. Yeah, I can. Not at the same time. You need to trust someone, Axel. Let one of us help you. Fine. What else? She said... um, she said something about building a rat trap? What does that mean? Meaning get them all jammed down one end of this joint, treat them like a bunch of goddamn vermin and then... What? Gee whiz, I don't know, John. What do you think? I think we're all gonna die. That's what I think. Hey, you. Hey there. Look what I found. Oh, sweet. Do you remember me? Of course. Vanessa. Hi. They told me you got back. That's good. Yeah. Are you ok? I heard about what happened to you. Yeah, I'm fine. I still like it here. Good. That's good. Hey, you wanna have fun? You wanna play a game? Sure. Ok, but you can't tell anybody, 'cause that'll ruin it, alright? It's gotta be just between me and you. What're we gonna play? Hide and seek. That's fun! Yep, and you can hide anywhere you want. But if you come out before I find you, or before I yell "I give up", then you lose. Ok? We're about to have dinner. Should I save you a couple plates? No thanks, we'll make our own. For protection, without touching your borders. You want some help, babe? (groans) Don't call me babe. (dishes clatter) Hold it right there. I just need to talk to Brendan. That ain't happening. (alarm sounds) (gunfire) (groans) He's in here! He's in here! (groans) Oh, sh1t! sh1t! (gunfire) (screaming) (fighting grunts) (screaming) (fighting grunts) (screaming) (fighting grunts) (groans) (alarm continues to wail) (gunfire) What have you done, huh? What the hell have you done?! Christ! I'm gonna need those keys. It didn't have to be like this, man. Not like this! No, it didn't. And? And?! And like I said, I'm gonna need those keys. God damn you. I should have killed you when I had the chance. Yeah, you probably should have. (alarm continues to wail) Let's talk about this, man. Come on. Oh, we're about to talk. You comin', new girl, or what? It's Susan. No, not with him. Why's that? He's one of them. No, not anymore. Vanessa turned me just like she turned you. No, this guy? He's... He's one of us now. You might not like it but that's the way it is. No, no, no, no, no, no. Yes, definitely. We can't just... what're you saying? The obvious. Jesus. We might as well be them. He's not saying kill the rest of them, are you? (sighs) No, look-I just... we can't stay like this. In here, us and them. Ok. Then what's the answer? I don't know the answer, I just... I did what I had to do. You didn't have to, you chose to. You just slaughtered their whole group. Yeah, all those people. For you. And you. And you. All of you, so all of you didn't have to die. Yeah, but... That's the way the world is now. Yeah, says you. I'm sorry, was it a bad idea? Obviously not. I'm... I'm just saying... What? These were people. We killed people. Actual people. Actually, I killed those people. That was me. You didn't do sh1t. So what's the answer then? We know the answer. Is this how you handle everything? You're throwing them to the wolves. You just love to be the good guy when you're sitting over there with no dirt on your hands. So that's it then? We all agree? Like it or not. Yep. Yeah. Ok then. End of discussion. What about the little girl? Callie. Callie! Callie! Callie? Callie? Callie! I heard shots. Callie. I was hiding for so long. I'm sorry. It's okay. Callie, listen... Do you give up yet? Yeah, sweetie. I give up. (sobbing) Quaid. The others. All dead. You're a traitor. (sobbing) I swear to you, I didn't know. I didn't know. They wanted you to have those building plans. Walked us right into a trap. It had to be you. (sobbing) Who did you betray us to? Hmm? You tell me or so help me god I'll... (gasps) (choking) Your god won't help you now. Where is Taka? Tell me where to find him. I don't know who you're talking about. Taka. I'm sorry. I can't help you. (groans in pain) No? No. And even if I could, I wouldn't. But you already have. I wasn't sure Taka even existed until now, thanks to you. Someday he's gonna come for you. I told you. I know your scent. Now you'll lead me to the others. Please don't do this. I'm begging you here. Look, send me then. Send me but leave the rest of them, please. Look, you can't do this. You just can't. You're killing us. You realize that, right? You're basically sending us out there to die. You mean exactly what you were about to do to us? And what you already did to Mohamad. This is-he was a murderer. Liar! We never said we were gonna kill you! Liar. We didn't. Someone here is killing people. And it wasn't any of us. It's one of you. Don't you hear what he's saying? Grab your stuff. Let's go. Don't have more blood on your hands. Come on! I can't go back out there. I can't. Just give us another chance. Let's move. Can they please stay, Vanessa? If they act really nice this time, please? Callie. I'm sorry, sweetie, no. I know it's hard to understand but they just can't. I'm sorry. (starts crying) It's ok. Shh, it's ok. Noon's your best shot. Now, get outside the city, you might have a chance. Someday when the monsters are gone and the sun is shining, we'll go on a new adventure. No, Callie! Callie! No, Ca-Callie! Cal-Callie... (sobbing) Oh, please. Ok, go now. Go now. No, no, Callie! Callie! You changed the code? What's the code? What's the friggin' code?! You can't open it again. It's too dangerous. I'm not doing it. Besides, she's with her people. She's where she wants to be. She's just a little girl. (continues to sob) I'm worried about this wound. Why? It's not healing over and you seem to be getting worse, not better. It doesn't matter. Vanessa, listen. We tried to stop the little girl but... she got out... I don't want to talk about it, Doc. She seemed to really care about you. Drop it. Do you think it would have been better if we just killed them? Right here in the hospital? What do you think? I don't know. Who knows what's right and wrong in this new world? Exactly. Nothing matters anymore. ♪ Sleep, sleep easy... ♪
