 The dreams returned last night. 
 Stranger. 
 More vivid than ever. 
 I dreamt of his world. 
 The world that used to be. 
 Before the Votans arrived. 
 I was born in to the world that came after. 
 After the vessels that carried my people were destroyed. 
 After the Arkfalls began. 
 After the terraformers changed his planet forever. 
 The Earth he once knew was gone. 
 Dead as the star system my people left behind. 
 When I was a child, Nolan liked to tell me: "This world has no natives, which means it belongs to everyone." 
 He says Antarctica will be paradise. 
 I wanna believe him but... 
 I've been disappointed too many times. 
 I love my father, but his promises usually turn to  shtako . 
 So is this the silent treatment or is this just a little more silent than usual? 
 I'm confused, maybe you could give me a little hint. 
 You know. Nod, twitch, breathe... 
 Yep, yep, yep. 
 Matching approach vector, I see it. 
 Look, how was I suppose to know she was married? 
 It's not like they wear rings or anything. 
 It's all weird alien pheromones, and quite frankly I wasn't born with a nose for it. 
 Never again. 
 I will never again involve you in a compromising situation like that. 
 I promise. 
 Projected impact-- 20 clicks. 
 Finally, guaranteed payday.

 Let's see what we can salvage. 
 We're clear. 
 Hundreds of years in space, only to die in their sleep. 
 Come on. 
 Oh yeah. Look at that Terra-spire there. Not even a dent. 
 Looks intact. 
 You got the whatsit? 
 Let's see if we can jump start this sucker. 
 Bingo. 
 What's it worth? 
 Earth Republic pays top jaja for Votan tech. 
 Pristine Terra-sphere like this... 
 Three million easy. 
 So we're rich? 
 Oh yeah, we're rich. 
 We can pay off Varus! 
 With enough left over for passage to Antarctica. 
 It's gonna be you and me kiddo, lying on a beach from now till the Arks rise again. 
 Suhri, Nuganma, Hajixa, Suhri... 
 Spirit Riders. Better stay-- 
 Because you people smell like shtako. 
 Enough! 
 You... 
 Outside. 
 Okay. 
 Hey! Hey, come on guys! 
 You know what we went through to get that? 
 Ooh, pretty, pretty. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Go! Go! 
 What about our roller? 
 Forget the roller! 
 C'mon, keep moving. 
 There's things in these woods we don't want to meet. 
 Okay, there's a settlement in this direction. 
 Alright, I saw it on the scanner, but... 
 I don't know how far. 
 We should rest. 
 No, keep going. 
 Irisa, what's wrong? 
 I was shot. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Now this is gonna hurt, okay? I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. That's my girl, come on. 
 Alright, big boy, come on. 
 Sho hooch. 
 Be gentle with her. 
 You're safe with us. 
 Drop the net, we're coming in. 
 Roger that, stand by for entry protocol. 
 That arch... Is this St. Louis? 
 Once. Now we call it Defiance.
