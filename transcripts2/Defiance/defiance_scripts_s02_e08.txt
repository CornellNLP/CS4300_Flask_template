 Previously on Defiance... 
 I wish to conduct business with your spy master. 
 So what do you want from the Votanis Collective? 
 Defiance exists in a state of ongoing political flux. 
 And what direction do you envision? 
 Away from the Earth Republic. 
 I am going to tell your husband everything. 
 This will end very badly for you. 
 Drink it. 
 All of it. Now. 
 The poison was on the flask. 
 I keep telling myself that I'm just holding down the fort for Kenya, but all along I have this terrible feeling that she's... 
 Dead? 
 I've done terrible things. 
 What terrible things? 
 She'll wake up. They always do. 
 I made a deal with something. 
 It said it was a god, but now I'm not so sure. 
 You shot yourself in the head? 
 More like the neck. 
 Barrel slipped. 
 I taught you better than that. 
 Don't do that again. 
 I deserve to die. 
 Hey! 
 Stop talking like that. 
 Anyway, you didn't. 
 Irzu won't let me die. 
 Would you stop that? 
 This thing inside you, it doesn't come from Irzu or any other kind of god. 
 How do you know? 
 Because I do, okay? 
 Because there's no such thing as magic. 
 It's Arktech. 
 It's Indogene nanorobots or some such thing like that. 
 It's science, and it can be fixed with science. 
 I don't trust that Doc Yewll, but maybe we can find a decent doctor in Cedars. 
 You're wrong. 
 I'm never wrong. 
 You're always wrong. 
 I'm occasionally wrong. 
 But my heart's always in the right place. 
 I wish that was enough. 
 [Sighs] 
 That thing, that kid, Irzu, is she here right now? 
 She's inside me. 
 Yeah? Can she hear me? 
 You, in there. 
 Irzu or the Kaziri or Robby the Robot, whatever you wanna call yourself, you leave my little girl alone. 
 Now. 
 Or I will come in there, I will force you out, and I will take you apart. 
 That make you feel better? 
 Little bit. 
 [Hailer chirps] 
 Viceroy Mercado. 
 What does he want? 
 Nolan. 
 [Whispers] What's going on? 
 [Moaning] 
 [Growls] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Groaning] 
 Come here, fella. 
 Mahsuvus Gorath, you're under arrest for collusion with the Votanis Collective... 
 That's a lie. 
 For acts of terrorism and espionage against the Earth Republic. 
 This makes no sense. 
 Got him? 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Hey! What's going on? 
 Your boy Mahsuvus is a Votanis Collective spy. 
 He was using his job as night porter as cover. 
 So since when are we political? 
 The Collective has planted a bomb somewhere in New York City that's gonna detonate in the next 12 hours. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Mahsuvus is a conduit between Brazil and the operatives in New York. 
 He knows the plan, the players, and the location. 
 Now he's gonna tell us, one way or another. 
 [Hailer chirps] 
 Hello? 
 Amanda Rosewater? 
 Yes. Who is this? 
 Free Mahsuvus Gorath from Earth Republic custody, or your sister dies. 
 What? 
 Disobey us, and she dies. 
 Tell anyone about us, well, you get the picture. 
 Who is this? 
 I'm the man holding a gun to your little sister's head. 
 Amanda. 
 Amanda? 
 Don't do anything this son of a bitch says! 
 [Grunting] 
 Kenya! 
 Kenya! 
 [Call ends] 
 [Dramatic music] 
 ♪ 
 Madam Mayor. 
 Are you sure the bomb is real? 
 We intercepted the schematics. 
 It's a dirty nuke, what they used to call a suitcase bomb. 
 What we don't have is a specific location, and that is where our friend in the box comes in. 
 And you have evidence that he works for the Collective? 
 We floated a bogus transmission, and he bit. 
 I've been his boss for the better part of a year. 
 His tolerance for intense pain makes him one of my more popular night porters. 
 Torture's not gonna work. 
 We don't have a choice. 
 49,000 men, women, and children live in Manhattan Valley. 
 There's no safe way to evacuate. 
 And even if there was, where would we put them? 
 New York is surrounded by ocean and raiders. 
 Have you considered a soft pitch? 
 Let him think he's safe. 
 I'll play the loyal boss. 
 Send me in with a solicitor. 
 We'll threaten legal action. 
 You'll release him into my custody, but I'll be wearing a wire. 
 What is your interest in Mahsuvus? 
 He's a Votanis Collective spy, and I want to save as many people as possible. 
 Well, that's very admirable, but we will handle this our way. 
 Of course. 
 State your name for the record. 
 Forgive me, but I'm still unclear as to what exactly your interest with me is. 
 Am I under arrest? 
 No, ma'am. 
 Favi. 
 Apologies. 
 Favi. 
 But where are my manners? 
 Congratulations on your promotion, Deputy Lasalle. 
 Corporal. 
 And it's more of a career change. 
 Now, how long have you known Mahsuvus Gorath? 
 I'm afraid I don't know him. 
 Really? Because we have witnesses that saw you visit the prisoner on several occasions. 
 My husband was incarcerated. 
 As you say, a woman has needs. 
 And were those needs spy-related? 
 Miss Rainier... 
 Captain Rainier. 
 My life here in Defiance has never been more prosperous, in large part due to the stability that the Earth Republic provides. 
 Why would I take action against them? 
 Because playing both sides would be a good strategy. 
 Oh, perhaps you are right. 
 I should consider that. 
 Have you ever given scrip to the Votanis Collective? 
 I like to acquire scrip, not give it away. 
 You were there when the Lawkeeper saved my life, weren't you? 
 Yes, I was. 
 Nolan. 
 Such a unique man. 
 There's a certain air about him. 
 Leather, bourbon, gun grease. 
 I'm sorry, but I really don't know what this has to do with our investigation. 
 Not a thing. 
 Simply that Miss... 
 Captain Rainier wears it well. 
 She's good at being a gangster, but she's not a spy. 
 We'll keep an eye on her, but Mahsuvus' client list is deep. 
 Nolan. 
 Are you two dating? 
 God, no. 
 We're just having lots of s*x. 
 You know I'm not going to give you the information that you want. 
 Yeah, I figured. 
 I can't stop trying, though. 
 You know that. 
 I know you do. 
 It's not personal. 
 No hard feelings. 
 Had our positions been reversed, I would have the shrill drilling through your arm. 
 [Sighs] 
 You know, my daughter's Irathient. 
 Am I supposed to care? 
 Common ground. 
 I also know you send half your paycheck home to your two kids in Brazil. 
 You'd do anything for 'em, right? 
 You're breaking my heart. 
 Human father, Irathient daughter, just saying, anything's possible. 
 It's you and me, Mahsuvus, we decide what kind of world they inherit. 
 Now I'm not saying that I'm carrying any water for the E-Rep. 
 You ask me, they're a bunch of puffed-up clowns. 
 Be funny if they weren't armed to the teeth. 
 But there's a lot of innocent folks living in New York City. 
 And your people hit 'em with a nuke, humans will never forget it. 
 You're setting up everybody south of the armistice line to be a target for retaliation, including your kids. 
 Now is that what you want for them? 
 War's over, pal. 
 Nobody won. 
 You know, at the Battle of Defiance, we laid down our arms. 
 The soldiers decided to end the war. 
 The soldiers were the ones who decided not to follow orders that didn't make any sense anymore. 
 I like you, Nolan. 
 Perhaps in a different life, we could've been friends. 
 Doubt that, pal. 
 But I might have been persuaded to buy you a drink. 
 Mahsuvus Gorath, where's the bomb? 
 What time is it scheduled to detonate? 
 I have nothing to tell you. 
 [Groans] 
 [Screaming] 
 Where is the bomb? 
 What time is it scheduled to detonate? 
 How's his heart? 
 Strong as a bell beast. 
 We're clear to go again. 
 [Chuckles] 
 All right. 
 [Screams] 
 [Hailer chirps] 
 [Screaming continues] 
 Listen, I need more time. 
 Once your man moves into lockup, I'll be able to get him out of town. 
 That isn't fast enough! 
 Look, he's strapped to a chair in the middle of a guarded building right now. 
 You didn't give up that easily when you were hijacked on that land coach. 
 How'd you know that? 
 Tell her. 
 Tell your sister. 
 He claims to have his people everywhere. 
 Ask him how his V.C. managed to sneak a bomb through border security into New York, and yet they can't manage to boost Mahsuvus themselves. 
 'Cause maybe he isn't man enough. 
 Maybe none of his people are. 
 Are you looking to die? 
 Kenya, don't. 
 If it's gonna save a city full of innocent people... 
 I think you should shoot me. 
 Do not hurt her. 
 Go ahead, do it. 
 Do it! 
 [Groans] 
 Get to work. 
 You can keep going at him, but I'm telling you now, this guy, not gonna break. 
 We're done asking politely. 
 E.G.O. extraction? 
 It is the only way. 
 Have Pottinger recalled from the Dakota Reach. 
 Do make sure the findings from the prisoner's procedure are couriered back to my office for immediate decryption. 
 Of course, sir. 
 What do you mean by "E.G.O. Extractions"? 
 I have a history with E.G.O.s. A bad history. 
 A dozen state-of-the-art E.G.O. devices will suck the information right out of his mind. 
 Without all of that shrill unpleasantness. 
 That could kill him. 
 Oh, it will kill him. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Knock at door] 
 [Soulful rock music plays] 
 [Knocking continues] 
 [Charge blade hums] 
 ♪ 
 [Knocking continues] 
 Oh, it's you. 
 Expecting someone else? 
 In the wake of the bomb threat, I heard the Earth Republic was interrogating the usual suspects. 
 You heard right. 
 I was questioned. 
 You? 
 They came to you? 
 Yes. 
 And not me. That's disrespectful. 
 Put your vanity aside. 
 We have a serious problem. 
 They're planning to pluck every dirty secret from the head of Mahsuvus Gorath. 
 They can torture Mahsuvus until the arks rise. 
 He'll give them nothing. 
 He won't have a choice. 
 Giemo has learned that they brought in an E.G.O. extraction unit. 
 Well, I have nothing to hide. 
 I know Mahsuvus has been helping you supply Rafe McCawley with weapons to use against the Earth Republic. 
 Mercado will know too. 
 They'll throw me back in Reverie. 
 Actually, I should think they'll execute you and Rafe and me. 
 No, you had no part in this. 
 A nuance likely lost on the Viceroy. 
 I will see Mercado flayed like a river otter before I allow him or anyone else to hurt you. 
 That's good to hear. 
 Don't be complacent, love. 
 It may simply be that killing you is a pleasure I've reserved for myself. 
 My life is in your hands.

 [Sighs] 
 That's my property. I better get it back. 
 Hey, hey. Please just step back. 
 Let us do our job. 
 Nice uniform, E-Rep. 
 Yeah. It's a good fit. 
 Nolan, I need to talk with you. 
 What is it? 
 Kenya's alive. 
 I talked to her. 
 I heard her voice. 
 The V.C. had her. 
 I have to deliver Mahsuvus alive, or they're gonna kill her. 
 Amanda, are you clean? 
 Come on, I haven't touched Adreno in weeks. 
 This is real, Nolan. 
 Kenya's alive. 
 Time is running out, and I've been working on a plan to free Mahsuvus, but I need your help. 
 No, Mahsuvus is staying right where he is. 
 What he's got coming, he brought on himself. 
 That is not the deal, Nolan! 
 If Kenya is alive, then we're gonna bring her home to you. 
 Give me your hailer. 
 What? 
 Amanda, you said it yourself, you're running out of time. 
 Give me your hailer, please. 
 So what's the plan? 
 Someone's trying to extort Amanda, claims to be holding Kenya prisoner. 
 And you believe that? 
 Given what I've been seeing lately, anything's possible. 
 So our hailers are now tied to Amanda's. 
 Blackmailer calls her, we get pinged. 
 Hailers only have a limited range, so... 
 We triangulate it. 
 Exactly. 
 I'm gonna head out to Cuthbert Ridge. 
 You stay here and available. 
 Lots of sabrewolves out there. 
 Let me go. 
 No, no way. 
 No, you need to stay put until we get a handle on whatever it is that's happening with you. 
 I want you safe in Defiance. 
 I'm not safe anywhere. 
 Yeah, okay, but... 
 And I can't be killed. 
 Okay, but... 
 And Amanda needs you here. 
 What do you need? 
 Keys would be nice. 
 Be careful.

 I know you will not fail me.

 You do yourself a disservice by warning him. 
 Your opinions are, as always, welcome. 
 We will not stand for reconciliation.

 "We"? 
 The men. 
 We stood up to Datak. 
 And I am very grateful for that. 
 He would forgive you and Alak. 
 Us, he would kill. 
 We risked our lives taking your side. 
 A decision for which every new day can be considered its own reward.
