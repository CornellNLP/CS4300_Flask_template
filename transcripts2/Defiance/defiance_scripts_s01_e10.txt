 Previously on  Defiance... 
 First we need to secure his marriage. 
 If they're against us, we'll never be able to take control of the McCawley mines. 
 I'm thinking about our son's future. 
 Wanna come back to my place later? 
 What's at your place? 
 Me. 
 No. 
 Come back and work with me. 
 I can't do this alone. 
 No thanks. Not interested. 
 You sure about that? 
 I finally got my hands on one of the artifacts. 
 [Overlapping chatter] 
 Yeah! 
 [Grunting] 
 You'll never please your bride with that shriveled worm of yours. 
 Your mother didn't seem to mind. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Crowd oohs] 
 Who's next? 
 Well, look at you. 
 You ain't worthy of Christie McCawley. 
 Yes, he is! 
 [Cheering] 
 Defend my honor, Alak. 
 Kick his ass. 
 [Crowd oohs] 
 [Coughs] 
 [Laughs] 
 On the eve of your wedding, you've defeated your savage brothers. 
 Now it's time to taste the fruits of your victory. 
 [Laughter, chatter] 
 I'm ready for you, husband. 
 All chanting :  Rembu! Rembu! Rembu! 
 [Cheering] 
 Oh, boys. 
 [Cheering] 
 [Speaking alien language] 
 Claim your wife. 
 Another round, Jered. 
 Koni shots for everyone! 
 Casti punk. 
 Not until we get to see you pony-mount your bride. 
 [Cheering] 
 Uh, ritual coitus is so old-school. 
 It's 2046. 
 Wait, are you saying no to your bride? 
 Are you? 
 Look, the thing is, Tirra, my real bride would probably have a problem with this. 
 Come on, man. 
 Nobody's gonna know. 
 Let it go, Kupack. 
 I guess that's what happens when you hook up with a Human. 
 Pink meat makes your  jondura  go soft. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Grunts] 
 Crowd : Oh! 
 Hey! 
 Is that a hand? 
 [Speaking native language] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Gasps] 
 Holy  shtako.

 [Doorbell chimes] 
 [Speaking native language] 
 Christie. 
 You are a vision. 
 It's all because of Kenya. 
 She made this dress. 
 She does have an amazing touch. 
 Well, it's only been worn once, and it looks much better on you than it ever did on me. 
 Kenya, I'm sure you were a stunning bride. 
 In another lifetime. 
 I'll see you both tomorrow. 
 Christie, in Human tradition I understand the mother of the bride gives her daughter something borrowed to wear during the ceremony. 
 As your mother's not with us, I thought I would give you something I wore at my wedding. 
 When we boarded the ark, we were only allowed to bring three items. 
 I took my family gem, my diary, and this. 
 It's called a  telo. 
 How do I wear it? 
 I'll show you. 
 My mother wore it, and her mother before that. 
 You know, the Human phrase daughter-in-law is so cold, so distant. 
 Our word,  hanya tavo,  means "heart daughter." 
 You are my  hanya tavo, 
 Christie. 
 Um, I can't see anything. 
 You're not supposed to. 
 In Castithan tradition, the bride is blind until her betrothed opens her eyes at the end of the ceremony. 
 I'll never forget the moment my handmaidens lifted my  telo. 
 At first, the light was so bright. 
 But then, after a moment, he came into focus. 
 My new husband. 
 It was magical. 
 It's beautiful. 
 [Background chatter] 
 I'm looking forward to this wedding tonight. 
 This town needs a party. 
 Weddings are stupid. 
 Okay. 
 See, most people, Irisa, they don't do everything alone. 
 They think life's more meaningful with someone at their side. 
 Some even like to celebrate this idea with friends and family. 
 You're going, right? 
 Hmm. 
 You're going. You're gonna be my date. 
 I don't date. 
 Why not? 
 I'm from the badlands. 
 You see, when I first came to Defiance, I was nothing but a card hustler. 
 Couldn't read or write, never thought I'd amount to anything. 
 Now I'm wearing a badge. 
 People change. 
 You're an idiot. 
 So are you. 
 Wound's triangular. 
 Paperweight? 
 Possibly. 
 Whatever it was, our John Doe took one pretty hard to the coconut. 
 That's one hell of a big damn rock. 
 Obviously robbery wasn't a motive. 
 I've seen that ring before. 
 This is no John Doe. 
 His name is Hunter Bell. 
 Who's that? 
 He owned the NeedWant back when it was just a hotel and bar. 
 Slow down, hot shot. 
 Nobody cheats in my establishment but me. 
 I'm not cheating. 
 [Speaking native language] 
 Back off, Datak. 
 I got this. 
 Kenya, bring these gentlemen a free round. 
 Let's go. 
 What are you thinking trying to hustle my poker table? 
 I'm thinking, damn, I'm gonna get rich off these Casti punks. 
 They're crap players. 
 You got that right. 
 You gonna cut me? 
 First lesson's free. 
 So is this one. 
 You're not as slick with the cards as you think. 
 Come with me. 
 Hey, lawkeeper. 
 Clancy. 
 Hey, Hunter. 
 Who's the kid? 
 My friend here just got off the truck from Yosemite. 
 Needs a bed and a job. 
 Does he mind scrubbing toilets? 
 Oh, he can't get enough of it. 
 So you and this guy were close? 
 Not exactly, but he helped me. 
 I owed him. 
 When did he go missing? 
 About seven years ago, give or take. 
 I'd only been on the job three days when I caught my first case. 
 [Pounding at door] 
 My husband's missing. 
 Hunter had a lot of enemies... 
 And most people figured he'd blown town. 
 Except me. 
 I found one drop of blood, and that's it. 
 If it was murder, why isn't there more blood? 
 Somebody cleaned the floor. 
 They missed a drop. 
 Yeah. 
 Look, Hunter was a... 
 He owed money. 
 He got into a fight, he lost a little blood, and he hightailed it out of Defiance. 
 No, look. 
 Okay, I've never owned a home. 
 Never owned a business. 
 But in this day and age, a man doesn't simply walk away from their accomplishments. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Yeah, not a man like Hunter. 
 I think someone killed him. 
 Turns out, I was right. 
 We've been in town, what, four months? 
 Never heard Kenya mention a missing husband. 
 How do you know it's Hunter? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hunter owned the NeedWant. 
 When he was gone, you took over, right? 
 It was in his will, which is the same answer that I gave you seven years ago. 
 Tommy, you wanna give us a minute? 
 People thought that he ran off, but I knew that he wouldn't do that. 
 You guys had a good thing? 
 [Screams] 
 Stop! 
 [Screams] 
 I miss him a lot. 
 I feel weird officiating this wedding. 
 Well, Rafe asked you personally. 
 Yeah, but that was before Datak was my opponent. 
 The whole town will see you standing up there looking authoritative and elegant. 
 It's good politics. 
 You know, Datak's putting all his resources into this campaign. 
 Should I be worried? 
 Now listen. 
 You have a very strong track record and my endorsement. 
 If Datak's going to beat you, he's going to need a lot more ammunition than he's got right now. 
 [Knock at door] 
 Madam Mayor? 
 Ah, Nolan. 
 Tommy. 
 You boys excited about the wedding? 
 I hope you're both going to save a dance for me. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 We found Hunter Bell's corpse. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Where was it? 
 He'd been murdered. 
 Body stashed in a hollow wall in the NeedWant. 
 What is this? 
 I thought you said he stopped. 
 This is just something I got caught in a drawer. 
 Here's to my big sister, the new assistant mayor. 
 Hunter's never gonna stop. 
 Someday you're gonna be running this town. 
 He's never gonna change. 
 Hunter sees something in me that no one else does. 
 Stop being so stupid! 
 He's gonna kill you! 
 Look at the choices that you make with your life. 
 Look what you did to Connor. 
 Look what you did to your own baby. 
 You don't even want to let anybody into your life. 
 I have someone in my life. You. 
 And I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you. 
 I think I'm old enough to look after myself. 
 No, you can't, Kenya. 
 And if it comes to it, I will do whatever it takes to make sure he never lays a hand on you again. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Mayor Nicky, I'm gonna have to ask Mayor Rosewater some questions. 
 Yes, of course. 
 I'm really sorry about Mr. Bell. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Hunter Bell was your brother-in-law, right? 
 Yes. 
 You woulda known him pretty well. 
 What was he like? 
 Charming, rich, handsome. 
 Maybe a little bit dangerous. 
 He was a bully. 
 Did he, uh... 
 Did he bully your sister? 
 No. 
 He loved her, she loved him. 
 She was devastated when he disappeared. 
 They're lying, both of them. 
 Maybe. 
 You know, I think that Hunter was beating on Kenya, and Amanda could've killed him to protect her sister. 
 Or Kenya killed him, and Amanda's lying to protect her. 
 So what are you gonna do about it? 
 I'm gonna go home, put on some fresh clothes, and go to a wedding. 
 Nolan. 
 A man was killed. 
 A bad man, long time ago. 
 You're gonna try to bury this, aren't you? 
 It's my job to keep the peace, not run around like Sherlock Holmes chasing old ghosts. 
 What about justice? 
 Make sure you wear a tie tonight. 
 My daughter is not wearing this hockey mask at her wedding. 
 This is an heirloom. 
 Show some respect. 
 She'll be able to see when she's walking down the aisle, and folks will be able to see her. 
 A Castithan wedding isn't a wedding if the bride doesn't wear her  telo. 
 I'm the one footing the bill for this thing. 
 Christie wears what I say she wears. 
 You Humans believe you're so superior. 
 The truth is you're primitives. 
 Your minds are dull, your hands are clumsy. 
 The scent of your pink skin sickens me. 
 Does this skin look pink to you? 
 You all look the same. 
 Let me ask you something. 
 You hate Humans so much, why are you letting your boy marry one? 
 Well, Alak wishes it. 
 No. 
 You've been good with this the whole time. 
 So I gotta ask myself, what's your angle? 
 What do you get out of this wedding? 
 I believe in love. 
 You know, I was thinking about how the McCawley mines are built on land stolen from Irathient settlers. 
 Now that's a tainted legacy that I do not want to leave to our kids. 
 So when I die, my mines go to a trust benefiting the Irathient population of Defiance. 
 You do think I'm doing the right thing, don't you, Datak? 
 Well, they're your mines, Rafe. 
 I don't care what you do with them. 
 Good. 
 Breakfast is on me. 
 [Speaking native language] 
 The wedding is off! 
 Datak, I understand you're upset, but if Christie does not want to wear the  telo... 
 It's not about the  gwoking telo. 
 Rafe McCawley has written Christie out of his will. 
 The mines are going to the I-raths. 
 Rafe may say that now, but be patient. 
 Once his first grandchild arrives, he'll reconsider. 
 I will not wait. 
 Instead I will win this election. 
 Then when I'm mayor, I will find a way to take the mines away from Rafe McCawley. 
 How does Alak feel about this? 
 Alak's a child. 
 He'll get over it. 
 My parents would not have wanted me to marry you. 
 And yet, here we are. 
 Alak is more pliable than either of us at his age. 
 We were immigrants. 
 We were strong because we had to be. 
 Alak will never have to endure the same hardships we did, and I thank  Rayetso  for that. 
 Don't you want him to be happy? 
 Our son loves this Human girl. 
 She makes him smile. 
 She lifts his spirits in a way that nobody else can. 
 A Castithan woman can lift his spirits... just fine. 
 Alak is of this New World. 
 He doesn't see the Humans the way we do. 
 He sees beauty in them. 
 Kindness. 
 Then he's lost the sense of smell. 
 Maybe you have too. 
 I'm calling the priest. 
 Perhaps Alak should be the first to hear of your decision. 
 You know, Nolan should really be here right now. 
 It's a waste of time. 
 Yeah, looking for evidence is a big waste of time. 
 You want evidence? 
 You know, if I ran things I'd have five deputies combing over every inch of this place. 
 You don't need five deputies. 
 
 
 
 What is that, a hair? 
 Whisker. 
 Liberata. 
 Jered. 
 Jered the bartender was working here when Hunter owned it. 
 Jered, it's Tommy. 
 You around? 
 Jered? 
 It's locked. 
 So? 
 So we've got to go back to Nolan and get a warrant or something. 
 We can't just... 
 Can't just what? 
 Poor Jered. 
 His throat's been slit earlobe to earlobe. 
 Just like Elah Bandik. 
 Someone didn't want him to talk. 
 Why are his fingers like that? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe nitrogen depravation. 
 This has all the markings of a Casti hit. 
 When I was about your age, the arks were going through their final preparations. 
 I had just won passage playing  ivali. 
 But my father refused to leave home. 
 I don't understand. 
 Why would he stay on a dying planet? 
 He said if the suns were to swallow up our world, he needed to be inside the walls of the holy temple. 
 He could not leave the Castithan scrolls unattended. 
 Not even in the face of death. 
 Do you know why? 
 No. 
 Because he'd made that promise to his own father. 
 Um, fine. 
 I'll talk to Christie about the  telo. 
 When I gave you permission to marry outside of our race, I knew it was a dishonor to my father's memory. 
 But I let you and your mother sway me. 
 I was wrong. 
 Dad. No. 
 I regret allowing it to have come this far. 
 But you are my only son, Alak. 
 And our Castithan blood will not be diluted. 
 Do you understand? 
 No, no, no, I don't understand. 
 Okay, I love her. 
 This is  bullshtak. 
 Watch yourself. 
 Without the name Tarr, you're nothing. 
 Nothing but a street haint with dyed hair and a record collection. 
 Street haint? 
 Isn't that how you see yourself? 
 You're always talking about how you pulled yourself out of the mud and made the Humans respect you. 
 I said to watch your tongue. 
 I don't give a kanga rat's ass about the sacred scrolls. 
 All right, maybe your father chose to die guarding a bunch of stupid papers, but I wasn't born on Casti I was born on Earth, just like Christie. 
 And we're getting married. 
 I didn't expect you to be happy about this, but you will obey my wishes. 
 Or what, you're gonna slit my throat? 
 That's the Casti way. 
 I'll give you time to cool off. 
 [Background chatter] 
 Datak. 
 Not now, lawkeeper. 
 Can't wait. 
 Will wait. 
 Datak Tarr, you're under arrest. 
 On what charges? 
 For the murder of Jered Kikema and Hunter Bell. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I'm so excited. 
 I even decided to wear the  telo. 
 I know I said I didn't want to, but then I was thinking, my wedding... 
 My dream of what I wanted it to be like when I was a little kid... 
 That's never gonna happen because my mom won't be there, my brothers won't be there. 
 All that matters is that you're there. 
 And if it makes your parents happy for me to wear a metal mask over my face, then so be it. 
 Christie... 
 There's something that I need to tell you. 
 Christie? 
 [Door slams] 
 What did you do? What did you say to her? 
 It's my father. 
 He... he's trying to stop the wedding. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I can't live without her. 
 You really love her, don't you? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Then that's all that matters. 
 Why in the three hells would I kill a knee-high Liberata bartender? 
 Maybe because he knew you killed Hunter Bell. 
 Or maybe because he helped you hide the corpse. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 You don't recognize this? 
 No! 
 Really? 
 'Cause we found that in your closet. 
 And that handle, that matches the caved-in part of Bell's skull like a key fits a lock. 
 Well, I've never seen it before in my life. 
 Tommy tells me that you and Bell were in business together. 
 Yeah. You might say that. 
 You're asking for a raise? 
 I'm asking for a stake. 
 I built this tent. 
 Quadrupled profits every month. 
 I deserve it. 
 Look who's all grown up. 
 When I first came to town, you were running brawls in dark alleys, jacking rollers on Urdu street. 
 My money made you, Tarr. 
 Don't ever forget that. 
 With all due respect, I suggest you reconsider. 
 You know, in some cultures when a man challenges the chief, there's a fight until only one of them is left standing. 
 You want power? 
 Power isn't seen. It's felt! 
 How does that feel? 
 [Groaning] 
 What's wrong, can't win a fair fight? 
 I win. 
 That's all that matters. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Drop the blade or I drop you. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 I believe your life expectancy has taken a turn for the worse. 
 Why did you do it? 
 Yeah, well, call me old-fashioned, but I believe in a fair fight. 
 Yes, you are old-fashioned, right down to your choice of antique weapons. 
 Well, I like to hit what I'm aiming at, and my aim isn't always too good. 
 I'll try to remember that. 
 That clown's making a move on my mines. 
 I imagine you have no intention of allowing that to happen. 
 See, normally I wouldn't think you and I have much in common, but when it comes to our friend Hunter Bell, I think we do. 
 Let me buy you a drink. 
 I wish I had the pleasure of hearing Hunter Bell's last breath, but I'm afraid someone else beat me to it. 
 Whoever it is, they're trying to frame me. 
 They planted that walking stick in my closet. 
 Any idea who? 
 I pay my taxes so people like you can figure things like that out. 
 Get out of here! Go on. 
 What was that? 
 Theater. 
 Datak Tarr is an egomaniac. 
 If he had killed Hunter Bell, that body wouldn't be holed up in a wall. 
 It'd be on display in the town square. 
 So then why did we bring him in here? 
 Now he's good and riled up, maybe he'll lead us to the person who framed him, the real killer. 
 You knew this this whole time? 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Thought you'd be more convincing this way. 
 Where I come from, framing a man is the act of a coward. 
 Tarr, I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Hunter Bell. 
 You had as much reason to kill him as I did. 
 Why not just have the  jondura  to admit it instead of implicating me? 
 You really think I killed that sack of  shtako? 
 Well, if you didn't do it, who did? 
 Don't know, don't care. I have a wedding to attend. 
 [Chuckles] 
 The wedding is off. 
 That's what Alak said at first. 
 Then we started talking. 
 Your son loves my daughter, and my daughter loves him, and that's good enough for me. 
 Oh, he may never get my mines, but I will look out for him. 
 And I will make sure that those kids have a wedding that they will always remember. 
 Oh, please. 
 Um... 
 We should get over there. 
 The ceremony's about to begin. 
 [Country music in background] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [Speaking native language] 
 Dr. Yewll? I got your message. 
 I'm just on my way to the wedding. 
 I won't keep you long. 
 Would you mind locking the door? 
 Have you come to a decision? 
 Are we partners again? 
 We'll get so much farther working together. 
 This isn't about the artifact. 
 Our favorite Liberata bartender was killed today. 
 Oh, no, how sad. 
 A Casti charge blade slit his throat. 
 Oh, Datak Tarr. 
 Why am I not surprised? 
 Nicolette. 
 It's me you're talking to. 
 I had no choice. 
 He was the only person who knew that we killed Hunter Bell. 
 There was no reason to hurt him. 
 Jered has known the truth for seven years, and he never said a word. 
 It was preemptive. 
 I was exposed once, doctor. 
 I couldn't risk that happening again. 
 Well, vision seems to be functioning okay. 
 I told you, I'm fine. 
 It's just this damn ache in my arm and leg. 
 Okay. 
 Let's take a look at it. 
 Okay, wiggle your fingers. 
 How did you get in here? 
 Kenya slipped. 
 I needed some salve. 
 Well, get out. 
 This is a sterile environment. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Thought you might come by. 
 Excuse the renovations. 
 Drink, ladies? 
 Or should I call you something else? 
 [Laughs] 
 I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding. 
 Yes, there certainly has. 
 The citizens of this town believe their mayor is a Human being. 
 What do you want? 
 Well, let's start with the truth. 
 'Cause I am bubbling over with curiosity. 
 I am an Indogene, Mr. Bell. 
 Nicky... 
 Camouflaged biologically to appear Human. 
 What are you, some sort of spy? 
 There is something very important in this town, Mr. Bell. 
 In the wrong hands, it could be very dangerous. 
 We're here to prevent that happening. 
 We're here to protect Earth. 
 Yeah? For my kind or your kind? 
 For all kinds. 
 Well, I don't want to get in the way of your important job, so why don't you give me a cool hundred "G" to keep that secret of yours nice and safe. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I've heard what an enterprising young man you are. 
 Quite the negotiator to boot. 
 This isn't a negotiation. 
 You're right about that. 
 [Speaking native language] 
 You psycho piece of  shtako. 
 chuping I was afraid I hadn't hit him hard enough. Ah, Jered, dear. Would you mind helping us clean up this mess? Relax, doctor. It's all cleaned up. It's over. Yes, I suppose it is. [Thud] [Grunts] You know, when I first came to this town, I wanted to start over. I wanted to right my wrongs, and you... Well, you told me everything that I wanted to hear. You were my inspiration. But you changed. You unleashed the Volge, Nicky. You murdered a harmless bartender. It has become painfully clear to me that there is no end to the lives that you're willing to sacrifice for what you call the greater good. If I can't trust you with a simple walking stick, how am I supposed to trust you with a genocidal weapon? The first needle was a paralytic. It'll stop you from struggling and also from experiencing pain. You know, I've changed too. I've become a healer instead of a destroyer. And that's why I'm so sorry for what I have to do. But it's for the greater good. Good-bye, old friend. There. You look beautiful. Didn't think I'd be this nervous. You have nothing to be nervous about, as long as you remember that your husband is your partner and your equal, and you are never gonna let him treat you as anything less. No. Christie, can I have a word with you, please? Good luck. Bye, Stahma. I understand you're not comfortable wearing the  telo. Oh, it's all right, really. So I made this for you instead. An old world bridal veil? I copied it from a book. Stahma, you didn't have to. I wanted to. As my grandmother said to my mother on the day of her wedding...

[Inhales deeply] Jered's fingers. I knew I'd seen that somewhere before. The Liberatas during the war when the EMC used oxygen bombs... That's what they looked like. Liberata breathe nitrogen, not oxygen. Oxygen poisoning. Today is a special day, an important day for Defiance. That's why I didn't want to spoil it with my presence. I killed Hunter Bell for what I thought was the betterment of this town. When his body was recently discovered, I killed Jered Kikema, whose only crime was witnessing my own. I realize it's only a matter of time before the lawkeeper discovers the truth. With my health, I'll never survive Vegas prison. So I've decided to end my life. I told myself I was acting for the greater good. But that kind of thinking leads you down a dark road. I can only hope I've left the town I love in better hands than my own. I'm sorry. She used to be good people. Sometimes good people do bad things. Congratulations, kid. You solved your first case. Yeah, I just can't believe it. Mayor Nicky. I know. People are a mystery, kid. Sometimes even to themselves. And they all have secrets. Only rule I know is that every time you think you have them figured out, they change. We all do.
