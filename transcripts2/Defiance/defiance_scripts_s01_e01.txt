 The dreams returned last night. 
 Stranger. 
 More vivid than ever. 
 I dreamt of his world. 
 The world that used to be. 
 Before the Votans arrived. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 ♪ 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 I was born into the world that came after. 
 After the vessels that carried my people were destroyed. 
 After the Arkfalls began. 
 After the Terraformers changed his planet forever. 
 The earth he once knew is gone. 
 Dead as the star system my people left behind. 
 When I was a child, Nolan liked to tell me this world has no natives, which means it belongs to everyone. 
 He says Antarctica will be paradise. 
 I want to believe him, but I've been disappointed too many times. 
 I love my father. 
 But his promises usually turn to  shtako. 
 So is this the silent treatment or is this just a little more silent than usual? 
 I'm confused, maybe you could give me a little hint. 
 You know, nod, twitch, breathe. 
 [Beeping] 
 Yep, yep, yep. 
 Matching approach vector, I see it. 
 Look, how was I supposed to know she was married? 
 It's not like they wear rings or anything. 
 It's all weird alien pheromones, and quite frankly I wasn't born with the nose for it. 
 Never again. 
 I will never again involve you in a compromising situation like that. 
 I promise. 
 [Beeping] 
 Projected impact, 20 clicks. 
 [Loud rumble] 
 Finally, a guaranteed payday.

 [Beep] We're clear. 
 Hundreds of years in space only to die in their sleep. 
 Come on. 
 Oh, yeah, look at that Terra-spire there. 
 Not even a dent. 
 Looks intact. 
 You got the whatsit? 
 Let's see if we can jump-start this sucker. 
 [Energy hums] 
 Bingo. 
 What's it worth? 
 Earth Republic pays top  JaJa  for Votan tech. 
 Pristine Terra-sphere like this, 3 million easy. 
 So we're rich? 
 Oh, yeah, we're rich. 
 We can pay off Varus! 
 [Laughs] 
 With enough left over for passage to Antarctica. 
 It's gonna be you and me, kiddo.

 Forget the roller!

 Come on, keep moving. 
 There's things in these woods we don't want to meet. 
 Okay, there's a settlement in this direction, all right? 
 I saw it on the scanner, but I don't know how far. 
 We should rest. 
 No, keep going.

 ♪ 
 The end of the Pale Wars had a beginning. 
 We all know the story. 
 As the fort burned down around them, members of the human and Votan armies laid down their weapons. 
 Their various commanding officers ordered them to keep fighting, but those soldiers, those defiant few, refused. 
 Instead, they banded together to rescue trapped civilians from the wreckage. 
 The power of that one seminal event galvanized the eight races. 
 Word spread around the globe. 
 Others refused to fight. 
 15 years ago today, armistice was declared and the Pale Wars ended. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 In celebration of this event, I am proud to dedicate this statue and commence this year's armistice day celebration. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Now I have to thank some people. 
 We all know this is only my third week on the job. 
 This project was commissioned by my beloved predecessor, Mayor Nicolette Riordon. 
 [Applause] 
 Ex-mayor, ex-mayor. 
 Took me eight years to quit this lousy job. 
 You're welcome to it. 
 I also have to thank two benefactors, whose generous financial support made today's festivities possible. 
 On my right, Mr. Datak Tarr, his wife Stahma, and their son Alak. 
 [Applause] 
 And on my left, the owner of McCawley Mines, Rafe McCawley and his children Luke, Quentin, and Christie. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Applause means that much to you, does it? 
 You want applause, Datak? 
 Pack up and leave town. 
 You'll get a standing ovation. 
 Defiance! 
 All : Defiance! 
 Defiance! 
 All : Defiance! 
 Defiance, yeah! 
 Defiance.

 That was the worst, stilted... oh, balls. You were great.

 Balls. 
 No balls. 
 I've been your assistant long enough to make the trains run on time, but that's about it. 
 Trust me when I tell you that you're a natural. 
 I have an eye for talent, I do. 
 Ladies. 
 Thank you. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 All right. 
 Thank you. 
 So how long you gonna be in Cedars? 
 Well, unfortunately, I have a niece who insists on living there. 
 Earth Republic has drained all the color out of that place. 
 It's so regimented. 
 People walk around like robots. 
 There's an e-rep that's been snooping around willing to share resources. 
 Oh, don't buy it. 
 Once they get their hooks into you, they never let go. 
 Remember, grasshopper, around here, we value our freedom. 
 Grasshopper? 
 Make me feel old, why don't you? 
 [Chain clinks] 
 How are the patients? 
 They'll be fine. 
 I'm prepping the Irathient for surgery, and the human is trying to make us think that he's unconscious. 
 Oh! 
 Drink. You're dehydrated. 
 Thanks. 
 Tommy, I told you to watch him, not cuff him. 
 He was armed. 
 Well, now he's unarmed. 
 See that patch on his shoulder? 
 If he really wanted to hurt you, those cuffs wouldn't stop him. 
 Come on, give me your wrist. 
 Yeah. You took too long. 
 I got bored. 
 My name's garret Clancy. 
 I'm the town lawkeeper. 
 The kid is my deputy, Tommy Lasalle. 
 That's doc Yewll over there. 
 Nolan. 
 My traveling companion there is irisa. 
 You served? 
 Yeah, 31st division, yellow jackets. 
 Jackets? 
 You boys stayed in it until the end. 
 You were with the ninth, the defiant few. 
 Defiance, yeah, yeah, I know. 
 This town is named after that battle. 
 Every damn thing was named for that battle. 
 [Chuckles] Too true. 
 Come on, the Mayor wants to see you. 
 My traveling companion. 
 Go, she'll be fine, but I'm gonna have to clean and close this wound. 
 Whoa. 
 Told me she was gonna be there. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I waited for a couple hours. 
 She never showed. 
 Quite the party town you got here. 
 Today's a celebration day. 
 The Mayor's office is right up there.

 ♪ 
 What do you say? 
 Best purification right here! 
 [Overlapping chatter] 
 To her. 
 Do you like 'em? 
 That smug  shtako,  he packed that audience with his own miners so he'd get a louder applause than me. 
 What kind of a man does that? 
 I ask you. 
 It's juvenile, petty. 
 It's beneath my contempt, really. 
 You're annoyed you didn't think of it first. 
 Well, that was unkind. 
 You know what I noticed? 
 Despite Rafe McCawley's efforts, the volume of his applause barely exceeded your own. 
 That says something. 
 It says my wife indulges in empty flattery. 
 No, my flattery is filled with implied promise. 
 Once we get home, our son is out for the evening. 
 Out? Out where? 
 Alak's not running with that gang. 
 I warned him. 
 He's young. 
 He's pushing boundaries. 
 Don't handle me, Stahma. 
 Alak running wild reflects badly on this family. 
 I've worked too hard, done too many unpleasant things to achieve legitimacy and respect. 
 I cosponsored this event today. 
 Datak Tarr of the hollows onstage next to the great Rafe McCawley, presented to these... these humans as his peer. 
 Now, I do this so Alak can aspire to a better life than was available to me. 
 [gasping] 
 Do you see? 
 I do these things, endure these painful encounters so our son never has to. 
 This is my gift. 
 When Alak rebuffs it, he breaks his father's heart. 
 I will talk to him. 
 See that you do. 
 I don't want to have to speak of this again. 
 [Dogs barking] 
 Mayor Nicky departed on the ground coach as scheduled, and a driver dropped off a proposal from ambassador Tenetty. 
 And? 
 Apparently Earth Republic is offering to replenish our antiviral meds along with the fuel rods for our Votek weapons in exchange for a mutual securities package. 
 She says... 
 Denied. 
 Okay. 
 The ark hunter who came in with the wounded Irath is still outside. 
 Any idea where she came from? 
 If she was abducted, we could have some trouble with the spirit riders. 
 No, Yewll didn't see any tribal markings. 
 Apparently, he fought with the ninth. 
 He's one of the defiant few. 
 That was a long time ago. 
 I'm more interested in what he's been up to lately. 
 Send him in. 
 She's ready for you. 
 Madame Mayor. 
 We're not that formal around here. 
 Please, call me Amanda. 
 Single malt? 
 Where'd you find that? 
 Traded with some scavengers. 
 They were using it to strip paint or something. 
 Mmm. 
 So my lawkeepers told me that they found you and the Irathient girl outside the stasis net nearly dead. 
 Is she some sort of bounty? 
 Your partner, your lover? 
 We're just two people passing through. 
 Irathients and humans, they don't have the best relations in this area. 
 I don't want any trouble with the spirit riders. 
 If she was abducted, then... 
 She's my daughter. 
 Your daughter? 
 She seems pureblood. 
 War orphan. 
 Found her abandoned in what used to be Denver. 
 She was in a bad situation. 
 I rescued her and raised her. 
 She's a good girl. 
 [Scoffs] 
 That's why she nearly cut my doctor's throat? 
 Like I said, she's a good girl. 
 Now, your lawkeeper, he took away my weapon. 
 Just doing his job. 
 Yeah, nevertheless, I'd really like it back now. 
 You feel me? 
 You don't look like the kind of guy to put down roots. 
 Are you looking to put down roots? 
 I am not. 
 Well, then this becomes an easy conversation. 
 Doc Yewll will patch up your daughter. 
 Grab a drink at the needwant while you wait, one you pay for. 
 When she's healed, our lawkeepers will escort you to the nets. 
 They'll give you back your gun and send you both on your way. 
 Yeah. 
 The spirit riders cleaned us out and got our roller, our heavy weapons, all our supplies. 
 Lucky to get away with the scrip in our pockets, so in order to leave, we need to earn. 
 And you're saying you're incapable of earning without a weapon? 
 It does present a challenge. 
 Hmm. 
 You know, the brothel is always looking for fresh faces, and a big, handsome guy like you, ohh, I bet you'd clean up. 
 You feel me?

 I don't remember asking. 
 Luke, leave him alone.

 Appreciate the compliment. 
 Also appreciate prompt payment.

 Thanks, doc. 
 Thanks. Can we go? 
 Frickin' deadbeats. 
 I don't like towns. 
 We should leave. 
 We're not headed into the storm divide on foot. 
 We need wheels. 
 So we sell the Terra-sphere. 
 Shh, not here. 
 That thing's like a loose nuke. 
 They catch us with it, they'll string us up. 
 So what's your plan? 
 We quietly earn, buy a new roller, and dig up the sphere on the way out of town. 
 Hey, big boy. 
 Yeah, maybe later. 
 Oh, you sure? 
 Come on, Kenya. Let's go. 
 Let's go? 
 Rupert, what do I look like to you? 
 I work hard to make this brothel a warm and inviting environment for my employees and my clientele. 
 I look after the Digbaa tree, I've painted the walls, and I even taught myself how to sew so I could make those curtains over there, and you come in stinking of the mine. 
 Sorry? 
 Well, it's insulting and disrespectful, so come here. 
 Why don't you go back to your quarters? 
 I want you to shower and shave and then you can put on a decent shirt, and then in the unlikely event that I'm not otherwise engaged, we can revisit your desire to conduct some s*x business.

 Nope.

 You?

 No, no way. 
 You almost killed an innocent kid. 
 We need a professional. 
 We don't have a professional. 
 Yeah, you do. 
 I'm a tracker by trade. 
 Are you now? 
 Yeah, I am. 
 You're looking at the guy who brought in the Miami bomber and presented Starren Dahrti with the head of his sister's murderer. 
 I'll find your killer... 
 For the right price. 
 It's not a bad idea, Rafe. 
 Starren Dahrti's sister is alive and hates your guts. 
 Details, shh. 
 He's one of the defiant few. 
 All right, tracker. 
 You find my son's killer... with proof, mind you... and I'll pay you, uh... 
 20k. 
 25. 
 I don't believe I heard you right. 
 20 is good. 
 On one condition: If you do find the killer, he stays alive so he can stand trial. 
 Are we clear? 
 Agreed. 
 Your companion stays with my deputy. 
 What, you don't trust me? 
 I'm fresh out of trust tonight. 
 Lock her up. 
 I wouldn't recommend the handcuffs. 
 He's not getting away with this. 
 Of course not. 
 I'm going to gather up some  chango,  pay Rafe McCawley a visit, pay his whole family a visit. 
 Datak, our son is in love with the McCawley girl. 
 And we'll see how he loves the corpse. 
 She's innocent in all this. 
 I remind you, she risked her father's wrath to clear Alak's name. 
 Would it not be something, when all this has blown over, of course, if Alak and Christie actually got married? 
 Are you trying to ruin my bath? 
 I have little interest in being in-law to Rafe McCawley. 
 If Christie were in the family, she'd feel comfortable coming to us for anything. 
 Dear, her father can give her anything she wants. 
 You're right. 
 He works very hard. 
 Such a dangerous job, don't you think? 
 God forbid anything should ever happen to Rafe or Quentin. 
 Christie's already lost so much. 
 She'd be left with so much to take care of. 
 The mines. 
 Yes, the mines. 
 If she were family, we'd be forced to help her. 
 Well... 
 It is our job to help our family. 
 I appreciate how you see things. 
 Do you appreciate when I do this? 
 I think a wedding is exactly what this town needs. 
 You're just gonna sit there all day without talking? 
 You know what you are? 
 You are very, very... 
 Disconcerting. 
 You know that? 
 Okay, whatever. 
 As long as we're both trapped here, we might as well eat something. 
 I'm not trapped in here. 
 If I wanted, I could have grabbed your wrist, broken every finger on your hand, taken the key card to this cell, which you left hanging from your belt, and before you knew what was happening, I'd already be out of this cage and separating your hand from the rest of you with one of my blades. 
 What is wrong with you? 
 You wanted conversation. 
 That's conversation? 
 You know, I think you're mad and you're taking out your anger on me. 
 I'm not mad. 
 I don't believe you. 
 I think you're angry that your scavenger friend left you here. 
 What is it with you and that Nolan guy anyway? 
 Fine. 
 He saved me. 
 What? 
 You heard. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, it was kind of like that with me and Clancy. 
 I was on a bad path, but, um, Clancy saw something in me and gave me a second chance. 
 How about you? 
 What did Nolan do to save you? 
 Something I couldn't do for myself. 
 Which was? 
 He murdered my parents. 
 This is good. 
 [Sighs] What's taking so long? 
 Hey, Nolan, when you gonna show us why you're such a famous tracker? 
 Well, before we try and figure out where he went, it might help to figure out what happened here. 
 The site's been pretty badly trampled down, but it appears that we got two separate sets of prints arriving from two different directions, which suggest that Luke and his killer didn't come out here together to duke it out. 
 They arrived separately, maybe for a meeting, one they didn't want to have in town. 
 Well, that's a whole lot of assumptions. 
 More like deductions, but I don't want to quibble. 
 Now, an argument breaks out, like our dog-Walker says he heard, then a fight. 
 Excuse me. 
 Luke is stabbed. 
 Maybe then the killer loses the knife, which is why he pulls out the cold fire weapon. 
 Only now Luke's got a weapon too. 
 [Grunts] 
 That's not human blood. 
 No! 
 Wait! 
 Okay, all right, so this is the trail he left when he ran off, right? 
 Now, you see, prints on the right are crisp. 
 We can almost read the boot print. 
 But the ones on the left are dragging. 
 They never quite break the ground. 
 So if he was cut, but he didn't bleed... 
 Cybernetic implant. 
 We're looking for an Indogene, one with a bad left leg. 
 Ben, my assistant. 
 He's Indogene, and last night he told me he had hurt his leg. 
 Where's Ben now? 
 Hey, Ben? 
 The Mayor wanted me to run some diagnostics past the big brains up top. 
 Here, check this out. 
 [Beeping] 
 [device chitters] 
 Hey, boss, what can I do for you? 
 Where are you? 
 Oh, just handling a few personal errands. 
 You at the office? 
 I'm on my way. 
 I've got to prepare for the Vidcon with Ara Shondu. 
 Yeah, the revised specs for the Maglev are on the side table under the geo reports. 
 Great, thanks. 
 Amanda? [Device beeps] 
 Do you hear that humming? 
 He's at the stasis net. 
 Amanda? 
 [Device whines] 
 Sorry, my hailer slipped. 
 You know. 
 What are you talking about? 
 It's in your voice. 
 I know you better than anybody. 
 I didn't have a choice. 
 The town's finished. 
 All you can do now is run. 
 [High-pitched humming] 
 [Device beeps] Rafe? 
 Rafe, get your men to the stasis net now. 
 Come on, you're losing him. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Hurry up. 
 You're welcome to walk, sweetheart. 
 Did you just call me sweetheart? 
 It was my second choice. 
 [Engine revs] 
 Ah! 
 Down. 
 That son of a bitch still alive? 
 Rafe, Rafe, no. 
 Hey, hey, no! 
 Hey, we need him alive. 
 All right? 
 Why did you kill Luke? 
 No choice. 
 He was gonna talk and ruin everything. 
 You're lying! 
 Hey, you see this cold fire gun? 
 I recognize the design. 
 It's an Omec alloy. 
 There's only one Votan race that uses these, and it's not Indogene, is it, Ben? 
 Now, I know you're in a lot of pain, but I need you to focus. 
 Speak! 
 [Groaning] 
 Everybody needs to leave, all of you. 
 They're coming now. 
 They're planning to attack right after dark. 
 What kind of attack? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Hey! Stay with me. 
 Is it them? 
 Are you talking about the... 
 [explosion] 
 What the hell is going on? 
 The Volge. 
 I fought them during the pale wars. 
 Without the stasis net, defiance doesn't stand a chance. 
 All townspeople, gather at Darby Square in ten minutes for an important address from Mayor Rosewater. 
 [Chatter] 
 All townspeople, gather at Darby Square in ten minutes for an important address from Mayor Rosewater. 
 It's already gone! 
 Hi. 
 Um... 
 You should come by before you leave town for one last visit, okay? 
 And I'll give you a discount, half price. 
 Don't start. 
 You need to eat. 
 I can't. 
 I've got to go out there and convince people to fight an enemy bred to wipe out planets. 
 We have no idea why they're attacking, and the guy with the answers is in a coma. 
 I'm in over my head. 
 You can do this. 
 You always rise to the occasion, no matter how tough the odds are. 
 You're sweet. 
 I'm right. 
 Well, right now, all I've got is a bunch of words on a page that sound like a bunch of words on a page. 
 Look, Nicky would... 
 No, you are not Nicky. 
 Don't give a speech. 
 Just talk to them. 
 Amanda? 
 The town's waiting. 
 Hey. 
 I'm proud to be your sister. 
 You two are sisters? 
 Yeah, why? 
 No reason. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 By now, you all know a saboteur has destroyed the stasis nets. 
 [Crowd murmurs] 
 What, what? 
 What about the Volge? 
 What about the Volge? 
 There is an army coming, Paul. 
 I'm not gonna pretend there isn't. 
 Where's Mayor Nicky? 
 The question is, what are we gonna... yeah, where's the real mayor? 
 We need somebody with experience here. 
 Your assistant tried to kill us! 
 Please, folks, just let the Mayor speak. 
 Just... please, just let the Mayor speak. 
 We're all gonna die. 
 [Microphone feedback shrieks] 
 That's right. 
 That's what you believe, isn't it? 
 So why not just pack up all your belongings and take a chance in the badlands, 'cause this town is done. 
 Paul, three years ago, you lost two sons and half your farm to razor rain. 
 It was a terrible tragedy, and yet you're still here. 
 Rupert, how many good men did you lose when the 99ers collapsed the South tunnel? 
 Six. 
 And have you ever once thought of quitting, leaving town, finding a safer job? 
 No, ma'am. 
 We all have our stories, and we've endured a lot: Raiders, epidemics, floods. 
 We're still standing, just like that big-ass arch up there. 
 We live in a great place, a town where human and Votan races live together as equals. 
 We strive for the best, but sometimes we fall short. 
 Sometimes we forget ourselves, and occasionally, this new world rears up and kicks us in the teeth, but we stay. 
 We fight because this town is worth fighting for, and if necessary, it's worth dying for. 
 Now, I'm going to stand up to what's coming, and I'm gonna drive them out, and I hope that each and every one of you stands with me because we are stronger together. 
 The McCawleys stand with you. 
 [Applause] 
 So does the house of Tarr. 
 The vig on all debts is forgiven for every man who fights in the battle. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Yeah! 
 These people are brave. 
 So they'll die with honor. 
 You know, sometimes you can be very cold. 
 Still here, I see. 
 Thought you would have taken the reward money and run. 
 Not without that. 
 Not to worry, though. 
 We'll be out of your hair in no time. 
 Guess you've got a lot to do out there in the badlands. 
 Promised my companion we'd head South, to the beaches in Antarctica. 
 They say it's paradise. 
 Hmm, I'm pretty sure that's a myth. 
 Still, I'd like to see for myself. 
 Yeah, I never did get a chance to ask you about the big battle, what it was like being a hero, one of the defiant few. 
 It was what it was. 
 I wish you strength, Amanda. 
 Enjoy your reward. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Yeah, good idea. 
 Stay close together, everyone. 
 Come on, guys, right inside. 
 Single file. 
 Let's go, keep walking. 
 Keep walking. 
 [Laughter] 
 Come on, hurry up, let's go. 
 Paige, hold on. 
 [Engine starts] 
 We got out of there just in time. 
 [Distant rumbling] 
 Oh,  shtako. 
 They're headed straight for defiance. 
 Make it about seven clicks. 
 They should hit Bissel pass just after sunset. 
 Let's put some distance between us. 
 We could make a difference. 
 They got Indogenes in that town. 
 They could work up a Burkus rig for this sphere, focus the energy, create a weapon the Volge wouldn't even see coming. 
 We'd burn out the sphere. 
 We'd be left with nothing. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I'm sorry, but some things, they just need to be done. 
 You're doing it again. 
 No, kiddo. 
 Don't! 
 Every time we get ahead, you blow it for us. 
 Yeah, this is different. 
 There are kids in this town. 
 I don't care. 
 Little kids, and, yes, you do care. 
 Don't you say that to me, okay? 
 I know you better than that, and I raised you better than that. 
 Go ahead, get killed. 
 Hey, I got no intention of dying today. 
 Most people don't. 
 It still happens. 
 Well, where are you gonna go? 
 Antarctica. 
 I'd send you a postcard, but I know you've already got one. 
 [Engine revs] 
 What does it look like? 
 A nightmare. 
 Who's that down there? 
 Nolan! 
 What are you doing here? 
 Saving your ass, sweetheart. 
 The Terra-sphere has enough energy to wipe out the Volge. 
 Doc Yewll will need to configure it to focus the blast. 
 Once it's online, we got to hold the Volge in the pass until we can blow the Terra-sphere. 
 How hard can that be? 
 My thought exactly. 
 Nolan. 
 Yeah? 
 Thanks for coming back. 
 Hey, doc, how you doing up there? 
 If you rush me, we all go boom. 
 If you yell at me, we all go boom. 
 Now you know how I'm doing up here. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 You all know what you need to do. 
 Hold your fire until you get the order. 
 We have a superior position up here, but the Volge are climbers, so just keep pushing them to the center of the pass. 
 That's where the blast will be focused, at the bottom of the canyon. 
 The Terra-sphere will obliterate anything in its path. 
 When you get the signal, take cover or you'll get caught in the blast. 
 [Device humming] 
 Ten minutes! 
 Ten minutes. 
 [Beeping] 
 You got it? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Metallic stomping] 
 Fire! 
 [Gunfire] 
 Don't let 'em climb! 
 Don't let 'em climb! 
 [Growls] 
 [Beeping] 
 [beeping] 
 I need more time. 
 [Roars] 
 [Groans] 
 [Timer beeping] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Roars] 
 Amanda! 
 [screams] 
 [Electricity sizzles] 
 [Gunshot] 
 Clear the area! Go! 
 Get back! Move, move, move! 
 Get back! Come on! 
 Back, everybody, back! 
 [Roars] 
 [People murmuring] 
 Yeah! 
 [Wild cheering] 
 Yes! 
 Medic! 
 [Cheering continues] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 I see you made some new friends. 
 I figured they hate the Volge more than they hate humans. 
 I'm still mad about the sphere. 
 I'll make it up to you. 
 I've heard that before. 
 I have to get up. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 You don't feel well. 
 You have to stay here. 
 You have to stay here. 
 Doc, can you please talk some sense into her? 
 Bed rest. 
 I know you mean well, but I have a few thousand things that need to be taken care of. 
 Bed rest. 
 Good human. 
 I'm gonna check in with you later, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 So you gonna make it? 
 [Chuckles] I think so. 
 How many dead? 
 41. 
 [Sighs] 
 Someone tried to wipe this town off the map last night. 
 They tried hard. 
 We need to figure out who sent the Volge and what they were trying to accomplish. 
 In the desk, in the drawer, there's a cloth bag. 
 What do you think? 
 I'm no lawkeeper. 
 Maybe not, but you happen to be all I have available. 
 Way to sell a guy. 
 Think about it. 
 This town, it's a nice place to live. 
 Yep, so I keep hearing. 
 Life is coy and must be firmly embraced. 
 It's gorgeous. 
 The ring signifies a pledge of betrothal? 
 It is the human custom. 
 The actual wedding comes later. 
 That's when they will swear vows before a  Shigustak. 
 Oh, this will kill Rafe McCawley. 
 Eventually, yes, if we're clever and patient. 
 I married well. 
 You flatter a poor woman. 
 Nolan used to say the two of us are children of the badlands... the wild, open spaces where the weak are afraid to go. 
 It's towns that scare me, all the people jostling for space, sucking up the air till there's nothing left to breathe. 
 Will we stay here? 
 I don't know. 
 My people have a God called Urzu. 
 He has a path for each of us. 
 Where it takes us is not always where we imagined. 
 There is a reason. 
 Nolan's people call it fate.

 So while you were away, everything went to hell. 
 Your new mayor is tougher than anyone expected. 
 Ben Daris is comatose, but if he wakes up, he could tie us to the Volge attack and to Luke McCawley's murder. 
 And with McCawley dead, we have no idea where the Kaziri is buried or where he may have hidden the key. 
 I don't know what to do next. 
 Relax, Mr. birch. 
 Don't lose heart. 
 When the town is empty, we'll be free to resume our search. 
 The backup plan, it's brutal. 
 [Laughs] 
 We're trying to change the world, Mr. Birch. 
 Mark my words. 
 One day, the survivors will thank us.
