 Previously on Defiance... 
 There's something inside me, Tommy, something awful and dangerous, and now I've let it out. 
 How many people do I have to kill? 
 How big is my debt? 
 You don't understand. 
 You're not killing them. 
 You're saving them. 
 Where have you been? 
 One minute, I was in the market, and the next, I was waking up in the woods. 
 Stop picking at me. 
 You know, sometimes, you can just be such a human. 
 They still treat me like an outsider. 
 You have to live in their skin. 
 How am I supposed to live in their skin? 
 It's a secret. 
 You're a show-off, Pottinger. 
 I never met a show-off who was quite as smart as he thought he was. 
 Why do you go out of your way to make him mad? 
 Mercado only respects people he hates. 
 [Camera beeps] 
 I'm sleeping. 
 [Laughs] 
 I want you awake. 
 Today is a special day. 
 What's so great about it? 
 Open your eyes and find out. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Moaning] 
 You know, someone could get ahold of that footage. 
 [Laughs] 
 And do what? 
 No more Internet. Let's enjoy it. 
 Your boss could see it. 
 Pottinger is hot for his own reflection. 
 He is not interested in my naked ass. 
 [Moans] 
 But I see you are. 
 Tommy : [Whispers] Yes. 
 [Moans] 
 [Footsteps] 
 [Door slams] 
 Viceroy Mercado, I wasn't informed you were coming. 
 I wasn't advertising. 
 Have you come straight from New York? 
 I was touring the provinces when I received some news. 
 A gift from heaven is about to fall in our laps. 
 Orbital object 29-A-L. 
 It's going to hit near here. 
 I need you to run point on retrieval. 
 Of course. 
 I'll send for the Fort Adams Ark Recovery Team. 
 No time. 
 Scavengers will come crawling out of the woodwork. 
 We can't allow outsiders to recover those cylinders. 
 We're not qualified for this. 
 You have an expert ark hunter right here in town. 
 Absolutely not. 
 You don't get a choice. 
 Take the lawkeeper. 
 The Earth Republic needs this. 
 You mean you need this. 
 Election day just around the corner. 
 Councilor Lyle has her maglev contract. 
 Ambassador Mueller is about to sign a truce with Winnipeg. 
 What do you have? 
 I have my best man on the job. 
 If I win, you win. 
 So what are you waiting for?

 ♪ 
 Must be quite a payload to risk scuffing that pretty manicure of yours. 
 What is it? 
 A terrasphere? 
 Cryotech? 
 Caeruleum core. 
 This ark used to be a refueling station for the entire Votan fleet. 
 Caeruleum is a clean fuel source that never runs dry, which is why our command's been tracking it for the past 17 years. 
 It's an endless energy source, Nolan. 
 We could change the world. 
 The world did change 17 years ago. 
 It didn't turn out so well. 
 I'm not interested in your opinions. 
 Well, you better be, because the only way I'm coming along on this little jaunt of yours is if I'm calling the shots. 
 This is my mission. 
 Oh, good. 
 Best of luck with that. 
 Let me know how it turns out for you. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 Your input is highly valued. 
 I look forward to seeing you in the field, sir. 
 What's Barbie Doll doing here? 
 Envisioning 12 ways I can kick your caveman ass. 
 Good luck with that. Where's Irisa? 
 I thought she could stay behind. 
 She and Berlin don't get along so well. 
 I figured we could minimize the drama. 
 Irisa has value. 
 Your girlfriend does not. 
 I'm here to document the ark hunt. 
 It's good footage. 
 Good propaganda, you mean. 
 Tommy, you're grounded. 
 Come again? 
 Once again, Tommy, you have proven that I can't trust you. 
 You can stay behind and polish the gun cabinet. 
 You're mad that I told Pottinger that you destroyed evidence. 
 No, I'm not mad. 
 I just place a high value on loyalty. 
 Oh. 
 Well, I quit. 
 Sorry? 
 I couldn't hear you over the engines. 
 I said, "I quit." 
 That's what you want? 
 Yes. 
 All right. 
 Put your gun and badge in the safe, and please, lock up on your way out. 
 [Engine turning over] 
 Hey. 
 I am proud of you. 
 You are better than this job, and you are better than him. 
 Look, the E-Rep is ramping up security at the border. 
 We could go there, start fresh, make a difference. 
 You'd really consider reassignment? 
 To the border? Absolutely. 
 That's where the story is. 
 It would be good for me. 
 It would be good for us. 
 What do you think? 
 Chup this town. 
 I say yes. 
 What's going on? 
 That's Belutok Kurr, a holy man. 
 [Speaking native language] 
 Witness the agent of this heresy. 
 I'll see you back at home. 
 I apologize, Favi Kurr. 
 I did not realize you found such offense in games of chance. 
 I don't care about gambling. 
 I care that a woman usurped her husband. 
 My son now guards our family interests. 
 Your son is soft as a hopo flower. 
 Everyone knows you run things. 
 I have noticed how your husband's men defer to you. 
 I am shanje liro. 
 They seek to protect me. 
 Do you know how our culture has survived so long? 
 We do not compromise. 
 And yet here we are, both speaking English. 
 It is the tiny concessions that are the most dangerous. 
 The tallest mountain can be worn down by a tiny stream. 
 Assimilation is natural. 
 No. 
 It is a virus. 
 One woman defies the system, others notice, and soon, they step out of line. 
 Eventually, women like my wife forget their place. 
 I can see how you might find an empowered woman threatening, especially a woman backed by a dedicated band of hardened criminals. 
 Threatening me will not help you. 
 We lost our home. 
 I'll be damned before I lose my culture. 
 Then you will be damned. 
 Perhaps, but not before I see you upon a shaming rack. 
 [Metallic clinking] 
 Nice place you got here. 
 Where's your bath? 
 Shower's out back. 
 [Laughs] 
 Where's this thing you wanted to show me? 
 Whoa. 
 Is that what I think it is? 
 Careful. 
 One wrong move, and they'll be finding your molars on top of the arch. 
 Ah. 
 [Footsteps] 
 Am I interrupting? 
 Not at all. 
 Rafe was just giving me an update on Christie and the pregnancy. 
 Hey, Stahma. 
 I was just thinking, maybe we could invite Datak over to the house for dinner this Sunday. 
 Okay, maybe just dessert. 
 I'd like a word with my husband please. 
 I'll see myself out. 
 Speak. 
 What do you want? 
 How much did you pay the holy man to come after me? 
 [Laughing] 
 You think I bribed Favi Kurr? 
 Even if I had the money, his honor is unimpeachable. 
 Oh, I had nothing to do with this. 
 Then who? 
 Do you think our community is blind? 
 You think no one would talk? 
 What you've done to me cuts against the very grain of who our people are. 
 You're seen as a danger to them, especially the men. 
 I know what you're thinking, my sweetest love. 
 Spread some jaja around, make the problem go away. 
 But with the boycott in effect, cash will soon be in short supply. 
 And may I remind you, Favi Kurr? 
 Hmm. 
 Oh, he cannot be bought. 
 There's nothing more dangerous to people like us than an honest man. 
 He would see me on a shaming rack. 
 I know. 
 You'll look pretty.

 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Where are you going? 
 Irisa. 
 Irisa, there's something I need to tell you. 
 [Choking] 
 [Hissing] 
 [Inhaling deeply] 
 Get off him. 
 Irisa! 
 Irisa. 
 Tommy? 
 It's okay. 
 Back away. 
 I didn't hurt him. 
 I said back away. 
 He's dead. 
 I have to get him out of sight. 
 Let go. 
 He needs time to recover. 
 He'll be fine. 
 I swear to God, Irisa, if you don't let go, I... I will shoot you. 
 Go ahead. It won't matter. 
 Okay, campers, listen up. 
 The crashed ship is three klicks to the south, just beyond that crest. 
 I'll take five guys, we'll scout through the woods, and we'll search for a way in. 
 Why limit yourself to such a small group? 
 We have an entire regiment. 
 Five's all I need. 
 You ever been inside an ark before in your life? 
 Any of your troops? 
 We'll start small. 
 You three, fall in. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Cheers. 
 Thank you. 
 Mayor Rosewater. 
 I understand you're acting as Special Advisor to your successor. 
 Mm, actually, Datak Tarr was my successor. 
 Briefly, yes. 
 I love this town. 
 I help out however I can. 
 When you're not occupied with your day job. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You must meet all kinds in here. 
 Mm, my clientele runs the gamut. 
 Well, my tastes, of course, run a bit on the quirky side. 
 More big city, really, than backwater bordello. 
 Well, our remote location affords certain advantages to a gentleman with a sophisticated sexual palate. 
 Utter discretion, for example. 
 What would you say then to a gentleman who is looking to... 
 Ah. 
 A local club. 
 Caters to more specialized tastes. 
 I thank you for this and your discretion. 
 Why a bioman? 
 What are you implying? 
 Not the smartest bodyguard in the world. 
 Found him floating in Kongeaen Creek, burns over half his body. 
 Kongeaen Creek? 
 You fought in the Copenhagen slaughter? 
 The C.O. ordered the bioman left behind to die. 
 He filled his purpose. 
 So I disobeyed orders and built a litter, and I dragged him to the nearest med-post. 
 After the war, I kept him on as a bodyguard. 
 His loyalty suits me. 
 I thought you of all people would understand that. 
 How's that? 
 Well, from what I hear, we share a similar history. 
 Do we? 
 Yeah. 
 We both rescued victims of the terrible war, took them in, raised them like our own. 
 Irisa is a person. 
 Your bioman is a killing machine made up of stem cells and spare parts. 
 You sound like a bigot. 
 I've been called worse.

 Beauty, isn't she?

 Bloody hell. 
 Hard landing.

 "Clean Energy," my ass. 
 This is a Gulanee transport ark. 
 Those aren't fuel cells. 
 They're containment cylinders. 
 [Cylinder beeping] 
 There's a suit missing. 
 So much for containment. 
 [Screeches] 
 That came from outside. 
 That's our Gulanee. 
 It burned us. 
 I got up, but they didn't. 
 I think they're dead. 
 I'm gonna rip that thing apart. 
 I doubt it. 
 [Hailer beeps] 
 All units, be advised, an active Gulanee is in the vicinity. 
 This species is pure Votan energy. 
 It's highly lethal. 
 This is an incredibly dangerous situation. 
 I want the area cleared now. 
 Clear out, do you hear me? Clear out. 
 Be on alert, and do not approach it. 
 How long did you say that ark had been in orbit? 
 Since Arkfall. 
 That Gulanee's been trapped in its canister for the last 17 years. 
 It doesn't know the war's over. 
 We're humans, enemy combatants. 
 
 
 
 He's not waking up. 
 Don't you trust me? 
 Yeah, I do, but come on. 
 He'll wake up, just like Bertie. 
 You did this to Bertie? 
 And she woke up. 
 Nolan was right about you. 
 I had to lie. 
 Why? 
 [Sighs] 
 If I tell Nolan, the thing inside me will kill him. 
 Kill him? 
 How? 
 Last year, the night I disappeared, I made a deal with something. 
 It said it was a god, but now I'm not so sure. 
 I wish I understood better. 
 How many times have you done this? 
 Answer me. 
 A lot. 
 Stop looking at me like that. 
 But Mars is a dead planet. 
 So is Venus. 
 Your men and women could not have possibly have come from there. 
 You know that. 
 It's an old world saying. 
 It means, "Men are dicks. Deal with it." 
 Oh. 
 Still, I come from a culture that worships dicks. 
 That will never change. 
 Well, look around you, Stahma. 
 Everything changes. 
 All the more reason for us to maintain our standards. 
 We Castithans owe our greatness to the strength and depth of our culture. 
 Mm. 
 And who created this culture, hmm? 
 Old men who scribbled it on tablets a thousand years ago to keep you on your knees. 
 Human women felt the exact same way, so we banded together. 
 We changed things. 
 We burned our bras. 
 Why in three hells would you burn your undergarments? 
 I don't know. It was in a book. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Are you sure you're sober enough to be giving me advice? 
 Oh, hey, cut me some slack. 
 I've been off the Adreno now for two weeks. 
 All I'm saying is, just talk to the other Castithan wives. 
 Bet you'd find out they're just as fed up as you are. 
 If they even knew I was talking to you in this way, they would cast me out. 
 I'm alone. 
 That's a dangerous place to be. 
 Hey, you're not alone. 
 Should've used the terrasphere to flatten the ark from a mile away. 
 What was your plan? 
 Ask the Gulanee to come along nicely? 
 I was told they'd be dormant in their cylinders, not suited up for battle. 
 Well, you were told wrong, and you're gonna get us killed. 
 Let's not panic. 
 What's our next step? 
 Well, the Gulanee are comprised mostly of energy, which is why you rarely find 'em on Earth. 
 They can exist in their canisters or in their battle suits. 
 Suppose if we could pierce its suit, we might be able to kill it. 
 Let's head back to the roller, and we can improvise a weapon.

 My husband requested nok-seed stew for dinner, and we were out of nok-seed. 
 Punished for tending to his needs? 
 That seems quite unfair. 
 The law is the law. 
 We women must abide by our traditions. 
 That is the thread that keeps our culture intact. 
 Perhaps it is time that our culture adjusted to suit our new world. 
 And what about your mother and all the women who came before her? 
 Is this how you honor their memory, by just turning your back on everything they stood for? 
 Why not honor their memories by becoming what they could not? 
 Let us be strong. 
 Strong women together. 
 That is enough. 
 We are shanjifyo, pure of blood and spirit. 
 Our strength comes from our traditions.

 How's this thing supposed to work? 
 It's called a pulse rebounder.

 No, it won't kill it, but it might paralyze it long enough for us to kill it. 
 Built one of these in Juárez. 
 Mind you, we had better tech in Juárez.

 Okay, I need you to distract that thing... I need more time. 
 Distract it? How am I gonna distract it?

 I could use a better weapon. 
 Churchill, this is all we have.
