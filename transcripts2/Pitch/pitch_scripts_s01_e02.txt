 Previously on  Pitch... 
 Matt Vasgersian :  The San Diego Padres have called up Ginny Baker to start today. 
 Ginny, hi. 
 Hi. 
 Oscar Arguella, Padres' GM. 
 Your teammates are excited to meet you. 
 Ginny :  75% think I'm the next San Diego Chicken. 
 The other 25 just want to see me shower. Blip : Ginny Baker. Get your big ol' bubble butt over here and give me a hug. I didn't see Mike Lawson back in there. He likes to make a grand entrance. Total diva. Hey. Find another scene partner. I'm here to pitch. Joe Buck : This is one of those moments where you'll remember where you were when you saw it. I don't know what's happening. I just... I just... Okay, okay. Get me out of the game. She needs your help. She quit. You got a lot of people telling you who you're doing this for,  and I wonder if it's not about time you start doing this for yourself. You do this for you. (cheers and applause) Joe Buck : Welcome to the big leagues, Ginny. We've been waiting for you. Of course the big story today, the only story, really. Yeah, it's Gin-sanity in San Diego. Ginny Baker becoming the first woman in history to win a major league baseball game. I'm not saying a word. Uh, listen, my grandmother throws harder than that. That's not sexist, it's factual, and Gram Gram threw heat. And Gram Gram has a shot at the majors leave it to the men to try and rain on our lady parade. There are already reports of dissention in the Padres locker room after Baker's first win. Guess some of those big, strong men don't like the pretty, little girl getting more attention, huh? Come on, boys, haven't you seen the movie? There's no crying in baseball. This L.A. road trip could not be coming at a better time. Kimmel wants to book you: lead guest, two segments. Jimmy Kimmel? They've got this idea for a comedy bit, "Ginny Baker's clubhouse decorating tips." I got to give decorating tips? It could be funny. You just have to tell a few jokes. We'll talk about it on the ride up. Ginny : I really ought to take the players' bus. I got to be one of the guys right now, Amelia. Ginny, look in the mirror. You are never gonna be one of the guys. Great movie. Just One of the Guys. '80s high school flick. She pretends to be a guy, end of the movie she has to take off her shirt to prove that she's a girl. First time I saw... boobs... I'll be quiet now. Take the players' bus. Okay, guys, one at a time. Game ended two hours ago. They're still here. Yeah. She's come a long way from San Antonio. Announcer : Hey, sports fans. Welcome to Wolff Stadium. San Antonio Missions are warming up for today's game against the Midland RockHounds. Take your seats. We'll be starting in just a minute. Announcer : And that's strikeout number nine for Ginny Baker. Good win. I keep hanging sliders. You see the one I hung to Archer? Oh, yeah. This new catcher's game-calling sucks. So, wave him off. You throw what you want to throw. He's the catcher. And you're the boss. Oh, whoa. Do you think for a second you got on that mound by following anyone else's calls? You're just saying that 'cause you're a good brother. I'm just saying that 'cause you're a good pitcher. You're a cheeseball. (chuckles) Slider-hanger. Amelia : Ginny? Hey, I'm sorry, but she only does autographs for kids. (laughing): No, no, no, I'm not... I'm an agent. I already got an agent. Oh, you do? Who are you with? Hi, Will Baker and I'm with Stay the Hell Away from My Little Sister and Company. You... Hey, that was a good one, right? Just let me buy you guys a beer. It'll be the most important beer of your life. I promise. (groans softly) You know your knees aren't getting any younger, Mike. When are you gonna bite the bullet and move to first? After I get to first with your mom. That's very mature. So is your mom. Guy's strike zone was inconsistent for her for the whole damn game. Yep. Their guy's nibbling, getting calls on both sides of the plate. Us, nothing. Yep. Another good talk, Buck. Lawson. Yeah, Skip. My team's broke. Look, I got pitchers taking swings at center fielders, I got a girl getting dressed in a closet, I got a pissy owner, and, on top of that, now I have psoriasis on my elbows. So I'm gonna fix my psoriasis, you fix the other stuff. I'll talk to the guys tonight. We'll all go out and celebrate her first win. How's the knees? Good, good. Yeah. Never been better. Good. That's good, kid. Yeah. (laughter) Ginny, when I got my first win, you know what I did to celebrate? You went out drinking with Babe Ruth. (laughter) Baker, what's your deal with men? You a nun or what? No, not a nun. Lesbian? (chuckles) Sorry to disappoint, but no. (groaning) Pay up. Stubbs goes down. You ever, uh... you ever hook up with another player? (chuckles) Between us... (sighs) I've got a bit of a... weak spot for a certain type. Every time I'm in a locker room with 'em... (sighs) something happens to me. Physically. I just get a little hot, you know, inside. And... sometimes... No, I don't hook up with players. (laughter) Are you out of your damn mind? (overlapping chatter) Light turnout. Wonder why. Nolan : ...howling at their sacred little tree house... Oh, this isn't gonna help. Look who's on the tube for a change. ...to the ground. Aw. Are the big boys on the Padres crying? Does it get their panties in a bunch that a girl's getting asked more questions than they are? I'm over this, boys. I'll see you at the yard tomorrow. Guys, the facts are clear. Two starts and one... Anyone want another beer? I'll get it. I got it. ...Ginny Baker wears the pants on the San Diego Padres, and her whiny, whimpering teammates... Hey, you mind changing the channel? Sure thing. ...Ginny Baker isn't going anywhere. I mean, two starts in, and this kid has a 12 ERA. One more time? Let's just settle down. I'm thrilled she... There's nothing fuzzy about the facts in the Florida case. The track star's own locker room was under renovation, so she used one of the men's empty ones, where she's assaulted by a member of the men's track and field team, who now has the nerve to call it... wait for it... "a misunderstanding between friends." Hey, I wonder what Ginny Baker would have to say about this. She's in a locker room with men... That should do it for tonight, huh? Shots, anybody? (laughs) Reporter :  Well, even on a travel day, fans are lining up to see Ginny Baker, as the Padres head up to Los Angeles for a three-game road trip against the Dodgers. Ugh! That was such a great game. You were dealing! Yeah, the guys love that the slowest fastball in the league gets the most media attention. Well, Blip said you won over some of 'em last night. I lost some of 'em, too. Well, I'm driving up later. I'll see you then. Bye. (grunts) So good. So good. Stop. Hey. Did you find it? Not yet. Irma might have washed it. Washed it? That's my slump-buster. You know it can't be washed. Honey, calm down. You're hitless in two games. I will find that awful, smelly T-shirt. I'll drive it up later. No, but if it's been washed... What, your Grandmaster Flash T-shirt will lose its magic powers and you won't make the All-Star team? Say it out loud. Go on. Hey. Hey! Look at me, Sanders. The only all-star team that matters is mine, and you're already the leading vote-getter there. What would I do without you? You'd die. I will die if you don't find that shirt. And it better smell like your mother's cookin'. Evelyn : Okay, okay. Uber. ♪ ♪ You waved me off 17 times last night. I didn't... No, you did. That's 16 times more than I've been waved off by anyone this season. You need to trust your changeup more. See here, I called for it, you waved it off, you got hit. Buck, she needs to trust the changeup more, right? Yep. She needs to be willing to throw the fastball when I call for it, right? Yep. Guy's a genius. And now I'm going to L.A., where I have to see my pain-in-the-ass ex-wife who's just hellbent on ruining my life, even though we're no longer married. She wants me to go through my things, you know, before she sells them. (scoffs) What she really wants to do is get back together with me. Why did God make me so damn appealing to women? I mean, it's a... it's a curse, Baker. Really is. Why'd you call me off? My fastball tops out at 87. I don't always trust it. All right. Well, you may not trust your fastball. You need to trust me. All right, see, same thing. At the end of the day, Davey McGee. He's the best guy available if you want a manager tomorrow. Davey McGee. We already have a caveman for a manager, Oscar. I want somebody fresh, somebody inspiring. Somebody who doesn't drive to work using their feet to power their car. Someone like you. You think I hired you as my GM just 'cause you're good at your job? I hoped so. Well, that and you look like Spanish Superman. I'm Mexican. Yeah. Uh, I know Al was your old skipper, Oscar, and I know that he gave you your start. He didn't just give me my start, Frank. I-I was a lifetime 230 utility infielder, and look at me now. He bought me my first suit. He's godfather to my daughter. This is exactly why I don't like to get too close to the people that work under me. This is why you have never been to my house for dinner. And here I thought it was 'cause I was Mexican. No. It is because, if I had to, I could fire you like that. (snaps fingers) I'm giving Al the season. Don't get too attached. Matt Vasgersian : ...breaking story out of San Diego, where the eyes of the sports world have been on Ginny Baker. Al : It's about time... This just surfacing, video from two years ago of Padres manager Al Luongo, commenting on Ginny Baker, then only a Double-A minor leaguer. Oh, crap. Blip. Al : Yeah, well, I hope she makes it to the show one day. I mean, have you seen her? Easy on the eyes. I'm sure a lot of the guys would love to have her in the locker room. Vasgersian : Well, the comments are obviously troubling, especially in light of the ongoing track and field incident in Florida... What? Ginny, we got a little P.R. problem on our hands. Have you seen Al's comment? You want me to issue a statement supporting him? We don't require it. It's up to you. But if you'd like to... Ginny, can I... speak to you for a minute? Yeah. Sorry. You want to come out in support of a misogynist who made comments about your looks? I told you I want to be one of the guys. How many of the guys are being asked to make statements? I know you're just trying to protect me, I know you're just doing your job, Amelia, but this is my life. It's my life, too, Ginny. When I met you, it became my life, too. Willie : So, after our father died, Ginny was pretty much doing this whole thing by herself. Felt too big for one person, so I quit school... You flunked out of school. Really? Okay, fine. I didn't make it past one damn semester. (they both laugh) Now you two are living out your dream together? Eh, her dream. My dad's dream. Me, I'm just along for the ride. That stadium was half full of little girls tonight. I hear it's because you convinced the team to do a "Little Ladies Night." A stupid idea. No, it wasn't. It really wasn't, Will. Thank you. Ginny's endorsement deal with Big Joe's Sports Apparel? That was your stupid idea, Will. Another round?

Look, I'm sorry to corner you like this, but I was hoping to get you on my show? Maybe we could talk about what's happening with the Florida rape case? Yeah. That feels like a big win for me. Ginny, you have a huge megaphone right now. Be a shame to not use it. Really, lady? By just being on this team, my manager may lose his job. My teammates don't even want to sit next to me on the bus. And you want me to comment on a sexual assault that happened on the other side of the country? Yet you'll doll yourself up and go on a late night show?

This will be the second out, but then the fun begins. Sanders's throw, way off the mark, as the runners advance. His throw is bad, that goes in the outfield. Not done, hold on. Voorhies coming home. Airmail time. Both runs score. And that's really the Padres's week in a nutshell. Yikes! Yeah, Al... you're having a bad day.

Nothing you can do to change that. So at least use it for good. And how, exactly, do I do that? Well, our manager's on the hot seat, partially because of, uh, what are they calling it now, "Gin-sanity"? I issued a statement last night. That's weird, 'cause, uh, I can't seem to turn on the television without seeing that thing you call a face, and somehow I haven't seen a word about that. Amelia : Excuse me. Who's the blonde? My agent. Maybe my former agent. You didn't release a statement? No, I didn't. Come here. It wasn't the right call. It would have been bad for your brand. I'm not a brand, Amelia. I'm a ballplayer. Ginny, I didn't travel to bumble-ass Texas two years ago to sign a ballplayer. That wasn't our deal, and you know it. She makes two times the minor league salary with her Big Joe's endorsement. That's not chump change. And that deal's for how long? Guaranteed two years with an option at three. I'm assuming their option, not yours. Uh-huh. Ginny, how long till you make the majors? Come on, what's the timetable? The quickest possible timetable? Two more seasons. So, hypothetically, when you make the majors, when a woman who looks like you becomes the first woman ever to play in the major leagues, she's gonna be exclusively bound to Big Joe's Sports Apparel? I'll get you out of that deal right now and keep you clean. And then what? You make me Michael Jordan? You might want to remind yourself that my fastball tops out at 87, lady. (chuckles) Ginny... I don't even know what that means. I'm not a sports agent. I represent stars. Movie stars, television stars, the most famous stars on the planet.

Well, now I know you're making excuses, because the jokes are not funny tonight at all, but... it's... (laughter) You know, it's exciting. I mean, it's exciting for the audience to have you here. - Thanks. In person to see you like this, right? Oh. (applause and cheering) Thanks. Um, yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't want to make it weird about the decorating tips. It's fine. It's okay. It's no-no problem at all. - Yeah. Um, it's just, I'm a ballplayer... is the thing. - Mm-hmm. And I'm just working really hard right now to be one of the guys. Yeah. Well, sure. Yeah. Yeah. Our manager's in trouble, guys. Hmm? He could get canned any day. This is the same guy who takes the blame when we lose, when it's us who plays Hacky Sack with the baseball. Yeah, same guy who didn't just convince Stubbs' ex not to sell their honeymoon pictures to a tabloid. He bought 'em, all to protect his own player. Is Ginny getting us more attention? Huh? (laughing): Yeah. Yeah, she is, man. Which sucks, 'cause we're losing in front of sold-out crowds. I gave my life to this game! Ugh. So I got a radical idea, mooks. Hear me out here. How about we start winning in front of sold-out crowds? How about we start winning for Al and his job? How about you start winning for your captain, too? It's a weird line to draw, I guess. Not everyone loves interior design, I guess, you know? - Yeah. I mean, I'm a 23-year-old girl with a high school education. How did I end up with a bunch of microphones in my face, and everyone wanting my opinion? It seems like I'm sort of making a statement just by existing lately, so, right. I mean, what the hell. Why not make a few more? My manager says a lot of stupid things, and some of them are about me, but he's a great manager, and he's a really good man. And he knows that he messed up, you know. We're gonna shock the world. And yeah, we're gonna do it with a pretty girl in the dugout. Yeah, pretty girl, who, by the way, works a hell of a lot harder than you lazy losers. So everyone can worry about some idiot comment that he made, what, two years ago, 'cause I won't be. I mean, there's bigger things to worry about. I mean, a... a woman... You need a minute? You okay? Yeah. Yup. A woman's not responsible for her own sexual assault because she went in the wrong locker room. That's not only wrong. It's dangerous. We don't need to make sure that every girl goes in the right room. We need to make sure every boy knows it's wrong to rape. (applause and cheering) So maybe... ...we all start working as hard as her. Maybe we start acting like a team instead of a bunch of spoiled brats. ♪ Have no fear... ♪ Then maybe I'll feel lucky that you guys are all I have. Lucky to be a Padre. ♪ Have no fear... ♪ For every last flickering minute of my damn career. Well, thank you for being here. You're an inspiration to so many people, and it's really a pleasure for me to have you here. Ginny Baker, everybody. (applause and cheering) (cheering) (indistinct shouting) Man : Yo! (indistinct chatter) They're gonna fire you. From now on, I talk where I want to talk, I say what I want to say. I call you off, Amelia, not the other way around. I'm the boss. Why does a high-powered movie agent come to South Texas in high heels to sign a minor league baseball player? We'll try again. We've only done two rounds. I think I'm done, Amelia. We can afford another round of IVF, Eric. No, I mean, I'm done. Having a baby is not gonna fix us. I don't want this life anymore. I don't want a life with you anymore. Aren't you gonna say anything? You just obliterated my life in two sentences, Eric. Forgive me if I don't give you the satisfaction of seeing me cry. We need to talk about this X-Men thing. They want to do a prequel to the prequel, so I guess with, like, what, four-year-olds? I actually think that's kind of genius. Man : We need a kid's director, but we need somebody with an edge. Woman : I like Robert Rodriguez. He's edgy. MAN: Who's the guy that did The Rugrats Movie? Maybe we could get him in here. I quit. I will go with you! I came to South Texas, Ginny... because I knew you needed me. (loud, overlapping chatter) (laughter and chatter) (upbeat dance song begins) Oh, I love this song! Who's gonna dance with me? Lawson. Whatever. All right, bud, I'm out of here. Later. Bye. ♪ ♪
