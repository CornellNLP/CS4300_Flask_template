 Previously on  Pitch... 
 Ginny called. 
 Baker. 
 Just confirming that we can't... 
 Not gonna say anything. Ginny's a big girl. 
 She still carries her rookie card. 
 Really? 
 But if it's being watched... 
 What? You won't make the All-Star team? Hey! 
 The only All-Star team that matters is mine. 
 And you're already the leading vote-getter there. 
 Mike :  16 years I've been playing in this town. I've seen a lot of rookies come and go.  Never met one like you.  Kind of blow me away. 
 Bill :  I'm trying to raise  a ball player here, Janet. 
 Coach : Trying a new pitcher. 
 We did it, Pop. 
 We ain't done nothing yet. 
 They're watching it now. 
 You seen it? 
 I got chills.

 (remote beeps, applause) 
 It's dominating social media right now. 
 36 million people have signed the petition saying "Put Ginny Baker in the All-Star Game." 
 That's twice as many votes as any player's going to get. 
 We need to make a decision. 
 Let's call the commissioner. 
 (Mike grunting softly) 
 Amelia : Wow. If I'd known you were such a hothouse orchid, I would've taken it easy on you. 
 (chuckles softly) 
 No, my back's just been acting up lately. It'll loosen. 
 You should be skipping the All-Star Game. 
 I'm not skipping the All-Star Game. 
 You can't even get your pants on. 
 (groans) 
 I don't know much about baseball, but I do know that it's bad form to play an All-Star Game without pants. 
 It's in my home city, for God's sakes, I'm practically mayor. 
 (pants zip up) You could get some rest. 
 I could get you a job as an analyst on the postgame show. 
 You ever think about broadcasting as a second career? 
 (scoffs) 
 Of course I've thought of it. Look at this face, look at these guns. 
 You think I'm gonna deny these to the world after I'm done playing? 
 Now, there's three phases to the Mike Lawson Experience. 
 Phase one, Mm-hmm. 
 Hall of Fame Player. 
 Phase two, Hall of Fame broadcaster. 
 Phase three, I move to the South of France, Mm. 
 I become the greatest horseshoe player (chuckles) of all time. 
 That's quite a big plan you've got there. 
 Maybe we should stick to phase one and phase two for now. 
 You're obviously hurt. 
 I'm not skipping the All-Star G... 
 (groans) 
 Game. 
 (panting) 
 Okay, uh... 
 All right, maybe-maybe a few days off, uh... wouldn't be so bad. 
 Set up a meeting. 
 I already did. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 I'm not abandoning you. 
 You're abandoning me in my hour of need. 
 (car door closes) 
 Mmm. Yeah, no. 
 I'm immune to guilt. Chickenpox and guilt. 
 Neither of them get me anymore. 
 Evelyn. 
 The only upside to Blip not making the All-Star team is that we finally get to take this family vacation. 
 The boys have been begging to go to Disney World for years. 
 Mama don't do roller coasters, so Blip's gonna go on Space Mountain with them. 
 But does it have to be when my mother's visiting? 
 You're my best buffer. 
 Now I have to spend three days alone with this woman. 
 Well, maybe it won't be so bad. 
 You've met her. 
 If there was an All-Star Game for silent judgment and guilt trips, she'd be MVP. 
 She's your mom, Ginny. It can't have been all bad. 
 (indistinct sports announcers, Ginny and Janet giggling) 
 Oh, come on. 
 No, no, you cannot say anything. 
 Not a word about getting your ears pierced. 
 If you do, he's gonna, like, board up all the doors. 
 All right, fine, but you do all the talking. 
 Okay, I'll do all the talking. 
 Just don't make me laugh. 
 Okay, I'll try. 
 Try hard, 'cause if you get me going, we ain't gonna never get out of here. 
 Okay. 
 (both giggle) 
 Be serious. 
 (exhales) Okay. 
 (scoffs) 
 Going to the mall, we'll be back. 
 Make sure you buy some oil for your mitt. 
 Tanner's oil. 
 Has to be Tanner's oil. 
 Ginny, you hear me? 
 Heard you. (clears throat) 
 She heard you, baby. 
 (door closes, Ginny and Janet giggle) 
 I hear you. 
 Got the luggage. 
 All right, well, hang in there, bro. 
 (phone beeps) 
 That was Mike. 
 He's bailing on the All-Star Game. 
 What? His back. 
 He thinks we shouldn't even pack, babe. 
 He says I'm about to get a call from the front office saying that I'm gonna be the Padres' rep. 
 (gasps) 
 We're the home team, somebody's got to play. 
 (exclaims) Who else but you? 
 Ginny : (chuckles) Nobody. 
 (chuckles) I told you! 
 You did. 
 Didn't I tell you? 
 You told me. 
 Didn't I tell you? 
 What's going on? 
 Daddy's gonna play in the All-Star Game! 
 (both cheer) 
 Give me some. 
 (laughs) 
 Do we get to go to the game? 
 Absolutely. 
 Right after we go to Disney World? 
 That might have to wait a little. 
 (phone vibrates) 
 Hello? 
 Yes. 
 Okay, but can... 
 Uh-huh. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 (phone beeps) 
 That was the front office. 
 Apparently, I've been named to the All-Star team. 
 I'm gonna be the Padres' rep. 
 We're going to Disney World.

 Colin Cowherd :  She's not an All-Star, Jason. 
 She's won her last three starts. 
 Is she the best of the best? 
 She is the star of all stars. 
 And this is the All-Star Game. 
 You think there's a guy in the history... 
 Hey, Baker. 
 It is good to see you getting some airtime for a change. 
 Tommy : Yeah, we were worried people might be forgetting about you. 
 Blip... 
 No. We are not having this conversation again. 
 You're gonna play in this game. 
 I'm-a go ride around in some tea cups with my family. It's all good. 
 All right? 
 She told me you were taking them on Space Mountain. 
 Papa don't do roller coasters. 
 Just give me 24 hours. 
 That's all I need. 
 Thank you, thank you. 
 Rhonda! 
 I need you to book me on the first flight to Amsterdam. 
 I'm heading to the airport now. 
 You can't do that. 
 You're the GM of the team hosting the All-Star Game. 
 Listen to me. Rhonda? 
 The entire baseball world is about to descend upon... 
 Rhonda? 
 Livan's 26. 
 What? 
 You heard me. 
 That means... 
 That means none of the GMs can know where I'm going, okay? Do you understand? 
 I understand what you want me to do. 
 I don't understand how I'm supposed to do it. 
 You're gonna figure it out. 
 I'll call you from the airport. 
 (sighs) 
 You see what I have to put up with? 
 Sorry to bother you, Skip. 
 No, no. Come on in, kid. 
 And when I say "kid," I don't mean it in a Bogart sort of way. 
 I mean it in that you're a third my age. 
 Sit down, sit down. What's on your mind? 
 (sighs) 
 I don't deserve to be playing in the All-Star Game. 
 I was just starting to be accepted by the guys. 
 It's terrible timing, and if I turn it down, they'll choose Blip, who deserves to go. 
 All true. 
 Let me tell you about how I met my wife. 
 We were at a friend's party. 
 I approached her at the food table, I mumbled something brilliant about the crudités and somehow I managed to engage her in a conversation, and then finally I asked her if she'd like to have dinner with me. 
 She had zero interest. 
 But I'd just got back from 'Nam. 
 I took one in the calf, I was hobbling a little, and she had a big heart. 
 So she said yes. 
 Pure pity date. 
 42 years, four kids, 12 grandkids later. 
 Didn't turn out so bad. 
 I'm not following here, Skip. 
 Take the pity date. 
 It doesn't matter why they say yes. 
 It matters what you do after they say it. 
 (sighs) Okay. 
 Let's check on the All-Star schedule, okay? 
 I don't want to do that. 
 I'm just dreading having to tell my mom that I'm not gonna have any time for her. 
 Ginny, she's gonna be happy for you. 
 (soft chuckle) No, she's not. 
 (door beeps) 
 Right on cue. 
 Hi, honey. 
 Hi, Mom. 
 (chuckling): Oh! 
 Oh, my baby. 
 Oh, there she is. 
 Amelia, oh, good to see you. 
 Welcome. 
 Ginny : Thanks for picking her up, Eliot. 
 Eliot : No problem. 
 You look well. 
 Thank you, thank you. So do you. 
 Three whole days with you all to myself. 
 Oh, can you imagine that? 
 Yeah, well... there's been a slight change of plans. 
 I just got named to the All-Star team. 
 The All-Star team? 
 (laughing): I know, it's crazy. 
 There was a public campaign... 
 That's amazing. 
 That is amazing! 
 Ginny : Yeah. It is, thanks, I'm excited. Um... but it also means I have a lot to do that I hadn't planned on, so... 
 So less time for me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 So what's the plan for tomorrow? 
 Um... tomorrow, I've got a lot of MLB stuff during the day, so Eliot's gonna take you all around the city, show you around. 
 There's a ton of stuff to do here, there's LEGOLAND, and... 
 Uh, the zoo... 
 The zoo. 
 And then tomorrow night, we'll get dinner together. 
 Certainly... looking forward to getting to spend some time with Eliot. 
 Hmm, me, too. 
 Oh. 
 Well, I probably should just go on ahead and get unpacked. 
 Mom, I didn't... I didn't, um... 
 I didn't plan this to avoid spending time with you. 
 No one said you did. 
 It's okay. 
 Good night. 
 Janet : Good night. 
 Wow. 
 I had no idea. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, someone once said when it comes to divorce, let go of worrying about the money. Go in knowing you're gonna get killed and then maybe you'll be surprised. 
 Well, you could have told me that before you showed me this. 
 She gets half the dealerships? 
 Well, next time listen to me about the prenup. 
 You still got one more contract in you. You'll get some back. 
 36-year-old catcher with 65-year-old knees, and a back that's playing peek-a-boo. 
 I've got two more good earning years tops. 
 So go to the Yankees or Boston... they pay more. 
 Or Texas. Get away from these state taxes... 
 I'm a Padre. 
 Then get serious about what you're doing after baseball. 
 Oh, I'm dead serious. 
 I've got a phase two. 
 And what's that? 
 All right, you guys ready? A little rehearsal here. 
 So, Mike, this is just a run-through to kind of get you acclimated for the way it's supposed to go tomorrow. 
 Okay. 
 You're okay with that? 
 Okay, let's do it. 
 CJ, ready? 
 Addison Russell, as you guys know, will be the starting shortstop for the National League and batting ninth. But the reality is this should be Corey Seager's job. 
 He has been the best shortstop in the National League. 
 And, Mike, you've been on this National League team eight times before. What do you think of this year's squad? 
 This year's squad? Oh, man, they're crazy good, even without Kersh. 
 Cueto's slide-cut combo is lethal. 
 Scherzer has the most legit one through four in the bigs. 
 Lester's a beast. 
 Among hitters, obviously, Chris Bryant is the man. 
 His ISO's at 2.92. 
 His weighted runs created plus of 153 last year is  ridonculous! 
 And his WOBA of .412 is off the charts. 
 Sorry, you know what? That was, uh... 
 .40... 403, damn. I-I'll get that. 
 Uh, Buster Posey is... 
 Uh, all right, well, stop ri-right there for just a minute. 
 No, I know, I blew that last one, but I'll get it tomorrow, okay? So, you know, don't worry. 
 But otherwise? 
 Uh... you know, good... 
 Yeah? 
 A little bit too much jargon. You kind of sounded like a stat-head and not a baseball player... Be a baseball player. 
 And you want to appeal to the average fan. 
 Think of the ten-year-old kid or the grandmother watching. 
 Right. Okay, yeah. I, you know, I was just trying to put a little flair in there, you know, a little signature style, but if you think I should adjust it, I could. 
 It was unintelligible. 
 All right. 
 All right, I'll, uh... I'll work on it. Yeah. 
 I hear Al just barely skated by with his job. 
 I heard Frank Reid wasn't quite so lucky. 
 I heard the same. Rhonda. 
 Gentlemen, I trust you're having a good time. 
 We are. Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We were just wondering where Oscar is. 
 Oh, he's wrapping up a meeting. 
 What kind of meeting's keeping him from his own cocktail party? 
 Huh? 
 It's not a meeting, actually. 
 It's an abscessed tooth. 
 Very painful. I was able to get his dentist to come down here to drain it. 
 The tooth that's abscessing. 
 You should see how much abscess there is. 
 I'm gonna get you guys a refill. I'll be back. Thank you. 
 That was weird, right? 
 Way weird. 
 That was a lie, right? 
 Bold-faced. 
 Livan. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 What do you mean, you think they're onto me? 
 Well, for one thing, it turns out I'm a terrible liar. 
 And for another, the story just broke. 
 And I quote: "A new report claims that Livan Duarte, the superstar catcher who recently defected from Cuba during a tournament in Amsterdam is not 22 but is, in fact, 26, making any team eligible to sign him immediately without being taxed." 
 She told me the story was embargoed. 
 (scoffs) 
 That's all right. 
 I have a huge head start. 
 Or not. 
 What's the matter? 
 I'm looking at Livan's agent shaking hands with the general manager of the New York Yankees. 
 Well, that's not good. 
 I know. 
 P.A. Announcer : The next batter in the Home Run Derby is second baseman for the Seattle Mariners, Robinson Cano. 
 Cano drives that one to deep center. 
 It's gone! 
 You'll be fine. 
 They're just getting it out of their system. 
 And there goes another. 
 Ah, they can't touch you. 
 Whoa, that one is way back. 
 (Mike chuckles) 
 And it's outta here! 
 He might be able to touch you. 
 Don't pitch to him.

 Go with whichever one makes the money magically disappear less. 
 Pow! 
 What the hell? Get 'em all! 
 Time out, time out, time out, time out. 
 I'm getting a phone call. 
 Hello. Hold on a sec. 
 Yes. Okay, I see. 
 No, that's great. Thank you. 
 Yeah, thank you so much. 
 Babe... 
 Dexter Fowler pulled out. 
 Hamstring. 
 I made the All-Star Game! 
 (chuckling): Oh, wow. 
 Wow, that's great! 
 Evy, I'm an All-Star, baby! 
 Yeah, I know. I got it. 
 Hey... I get to be introduced and tip my cap to the home crowd while watching the fighter jets fly over. 
 Yay. 
 This is the biggest moment of my life. 
 Are you seriously not happy for me? 
 Of course. I'm very happy for you, babe. 
 Wow. 
 It's nice to have such a supportive wife. 
 Excuse me? 
 No, wait... I'm not supportive? 
 Look, how you...? 
 No, you said yours. I'm gonna say mine. 
 I did single-A with you. I did double-A. 
 I've sat through 0 for 4s and slumps and benchings. 
 There's almost a year of our marriage MIA for all of the road trips, and I've never complained. 
 Not once. 
 I recap every game, every moment of your life every night... and it's the highlight of my day. 
 I raise your sons when you're gone. 
 I keep your home while you're away, and I'm ready to uproot our lives if another old man decides on a whim he wants you more than the one who currently pays you. 
 So perhaps you will allow me one single moment of disappointment upon learning our family vacation was just ruined with a phone call. 
 The boys and I will watch the game from here. 
 I'll take them to the theme park all by myself like I do all the time in San Diego. 
 And we'll see you back there in a few days. 
 You go enjoy the biggest moment of your life with the fighter planes. 
 Hmm, turns out watching the Home Run Derby is not the cure for feeling like a fraud. 
 You're not a fraud. 
 (sighs) 
 I should be going over the hitters with you tonight, not going to dinner with my mom. 
 She's gonna make me feel guilty. 
 You want me to come? 
 Would you? 
 Sure. Moms love me. 
 I mean, I gotta do a little prep work for this broadcast thing, but I can grab a quick bite. 
 That would be amazing. Thank you. 
 Oh, hey, I invited Amelia, my agent. 
 You met her once? 
 Anyway, you should talk to her about the broadcasting stuff. 
 She's the best. 
 Oh. Good to know. 
 
 
 
 (jazz playing) 
 Nice dress. 
 Oh, thanks, Mom. 
 You look beautiful. 
 Um, listen, I hope you don't mind, I invited a couple friends to join us. 
 I don't mind. Actually, I invited somebody to join us, too. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Oh, here he is. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Kevin, this is my daughter, Ginny. 
 Hi. Nice to meet you. 
 Hello. 
 Kevin's a friend from Tarboro. 
 He was in Arizona on business. 
 When I found out I'd basically be spending the trip alone, I just, well, I asked him to join me. 
 Ginny : I see. 
 Uh, ladies? 
 Oh, all right. 
 Oh, Mom, can I have a moment? 
 Oh, uh... 
 Sorry. 
 Go ahead. 
 Okay. 
 A friend? 
 We're dating. 
 And you didn't feel like giving me a heads-up that you were inviting him or, I don't know, that you have a boyfriend? 
 Oh, you mean, like, the heads-up you gave me that you were gonna be playing in the All-Star Game? 
 And I don't think I need your permission to start to date again. 
 This is so like you to be doing this. 
 The night before the All-Star Game. 
 What am I doing? 
 What am I doing? 
 Mike : There you are. 
 Oh, Ginny didn't tell me she invited her sister. 
 Don't bother, she's taken. 
 Hey, Amelia. You remember Mike Lawson? 
 Uh, yes. We met briefly. Nice to see you. 
 You as well. 
 We were just heading to our table. 
 Oh, good, you're here. This is gonna be fun. 
 We may want our meal to go. 
 Mm. 
 So, how long you two been a couple? 
 Oh, no, no. We're not a couple. 
 No, not... 
 I didn't even know that Amelia was gonna be here tonight when Ginny invited me, no. 
 No, it was a total surprise. 
 Right, and since he barely knows me, it was just such a boring surprise. 
 Right, exactly. 
 How long have you two been together? 
 Oh, um, a little over a year now? Mm-hmm. 
 A year? Really? 
 Well, I mean, we knew each other from a distance. 
 Uh, uh... 
 Kevin is from Tarboro, where we're from, but we, um... 
 I was married until recently. 
 Just got a divorce about a year ago. 
 So we really got to know each other after that. 
 But I've seen you play. 
 I used to come to a lot of your games. 
 I mean, the whole town did. 
 She was a sight to behold. 
 Still is. 
 Speaking of watching her games, um... we were hoping we could get Kevin a ticket to the All-Star Game. 
 Ginny : Mm. I only got the one for you, so... 
 Kevin : It's okay. 
 Mike : No, no. 
 I have a couple I'm not using. Have at 'em. 
 Janet : Thank you, Mike. 
 Kevin : Wow, thanks. 
 Much, much appreciated. 
 It's not every day that your daughter's an All-Star. 
 No, it's not. 
 Janet : Ginny-bean...

 Oh, I love it. 
 Well, try it on! Try it! 
 Oh, it's so pretty! 
 What's all the fuss? What's that? 
 It's for the dance tomorrow night. 
 Tomorrow? 
 Oh, no. You're gonna have to miss it. 
 Bill, this is her first school dance. 
 And the All-Star travel team tryouts are on Saturday, and you ain't near ready. 
 The All-Star travel team? 
 That means she's gonna be playing all year-round. 
 Yeah. She needs to be. 
 Look, you want to go, go. 
 You want to spend your time like all the other girls going to dances and chasing boys, that's fine by me. 
 But I ain't gonna be out there, wasting my time on you. 
 Oh, for God's sakes. 
 I'm offering her a choice, Janet. 
 Now, she's old enough to make up her own mind! 
 This is it, little girl. 
 Decision time. 
 You want to be a ballplayer? 
 Because I will take you as far as I can. 
 I will take you all the way with this. 
 But you gotta give it everything you got. 
 You in or out? 
 I'll see you out in the yard. 
 I'm sorry, Mom. 
 You don't have to apologize to me. 
 I understand. 
 Just know this: If you change your mind, or if it ever just gets to be too much for you one day and you need me to step in, I'll do it. 
 I'll be right here waiting. 
 I love you. 
 And there is nothing that you can ever do to make me stop loving you. 
 You're young. 
 I know how hard this is for you. 
 Come here. 
 Oscar, this is a waste of time. (chuckles) 
 The Yankees have an $8 million signing bonus on the table. 
 You gonna match that? 
 Just get me 15 minutes with him. 
 Oscar... 
 That's all I ask. Come on, you're gonna have me fly 6,000 miles sitting next to a guy hacking up a lung, baby screaming the entire way, and you won't even let me meet the kid? 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Thank you.

 What if I'm coming to the end of phase one and it turns out I'm no good at phase two? 
 Then you go straight to horseshoes.

Joe Buck :  And, Smoltzy, if that wasn't enough drama for you, she's being brought in to face Salvador Pérez, who was actually the leading vote-getter for the game, but his numbers paled in comparison to the onslaught Ginny garnered on the Internet. Smoltz :  You got to figure that's sticking in his craw a little bit. Joe Buck :  Obviously some controversy surrounding her selection. Smoltz :  And I'm sure every part of her is thinking about justifying that selection right now. Joe Buck :  So, the stage is set. Baker looks in to get her sign. She gets it from Posey. And here's the wind. (cheering) This ball is hammered into left! Back at the wall... And gone! Salvador Pérez crushed that one! That cannot be, at all,  how Ginny Baker wanted to answer all these critics. Smoltz :  No, I wouldn't think so. ♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter) ♪ ♪ (laughter) (panting) Livan. This is Oscar Arguella of the San Diego Padres. Thank you. Mm-hmm. (speaking Spanish) No, no, no. Please, no Spanish. It's too obvious,  papi. Fair enough. You know how I knew you were gonna catch that? 'Cause I know that's what you used for a ball as a kid. Just like I did. 'Cause neither of us could afford a real one. I know what the Yankees are offering you, and I can't match it. I can come close, but I can't match it. What I can give you is someone who understands that journey. No, I didn't grow up in Cuba. I grew up in Mexico. And I was not as good as you. I didn't have a tenth of your talent. But I know what it's like to grow up that poor. And what I know now, that I didn't know at your age, is that it's not just about how rich you can get. It's about who you surround yourself with. When I came up, I came up with a wild crew from the minors. I mean, every night after every game, out drinking. I blew my career, pissed away everything. Luckily, I had someone who went out on a limb for me. Gave me a job as a scout. That man is my manager today. He could be your manager, too. The Yankees can give you a little more money, but I can give you a home. And I promise you that San Diego will embrace you as one of their own. My agent tells me you're having front-office problems, that you're bringing somebody new in. I'm not going anywhere. I'm your guy. I'm not sitting behind Mike Lawson. You're never ready to go. (chuckles) I always do... I be following the cards all the time. Right, over... he's okay over there. (phone buzzing) I hope he's ready to go. Make sure we'll help him out. Man : Okay, here we go, in five, four, three... (exhales) ♪ ♪ Welcome to the All-Star postgame show as we come to you live on Fox... I'm Chris Myers. Nice to have with us CJ Nitkowski, Dontrelle Willis, and a very special guest, hometown hero Mike Lawson. And, Mike, it's good to have you along with us. Well, thanks for having me. And let's get right to it. Story of the night, Salvador Pérez going deep off Ginny Baker. Give us your thoughts. Salvy Peréz swings at the first pitch 74% of the time. I'm sure that Ginny was hoping to get him to chase one there. Of course, her walk-to-strikeout ratio is... it's... (sighs) You know, I was getting dressed in the locker room, trying to commit all these essential facts to memory, and I, uh, and I saw her give up that home run, and all I could think of was, God, this game is hard. I mean, it is so humbling. I mean, even those of us who are All-Stars, we fail so much of the time. I mean, great hitters fail seven out of every ten times at bat. You know, there's such a fine line between being too inside your head and not having your head in the game enough. There's just no margin for error. You know? And yeah, she... she left one over the plate, and a great hitter got ahold of it. And now there's gonna be even more talk about how she never deserved to be here in the first place. But let me tell you something, this girl... this woman... Is a gamer. She's a total gamer. Doesn't matter what you throw at her, she gets back up. Hell of a lot stronger than I am, that's for sure. Not sure if I did any analysis there, but those are my thoughts. And, you know, spoken from the heart, Mike, and we thank you for that. Shifting gears here, I just got a note from our producer, and I want to get your thoughts on this breaking news, because our Ken Rosenthal has just reported that highly sought after Cuban defector Livan Duarte has just announced he's signed with none other than the San Diego Padres. Most people had him going to the Yankees. And I don't want to put you on the spot here, but, Mike, Duarte is a catcher, he's coming to your team, so you must have a reaction to this. Yeah. That guy's not taking my job. (knocking) (knocking) Ginny? (door opens) Ginny-bean? Didn't you hear me knocking? It's time to take your studs out. I got you some hoop earrings. I won't be able to wear them. I'll be playing baseball. Ginny, you want some water? What's gotten into you? (pitch hits mitt loudly) Where were you? You go through the trouble to ask for a ticket, you don't even show? I was taking Kevin to the airport. He didn't feel comfortable being there. I didn't exactly feel welcome, either. You are unbelievable. It's always about you. You couldn't put your ego aside for one start? For the All-Star Game? There's always another start, and another, and then another since you were 12 years old. And when has it ever been about me? You never liked baseball. You always tied it to Pop's death. Baseball didn't kill your father. A drunk driver killed your father. Baseball killed my marriage and took my daughter away from me. That's not true. No. Isn't it? I just don't understand. We used to be so close. Now I can't even get three hours with you. Losing your father... was incredibly painful. But it happened a long time before he died. (whispering): Losing you... The most painful thing that ever happened to me. Why did you shut me out? I never made you choose. Why? Why? (laughter echoing) I love you, and there is nothing that you can ever do to make me stop loving you. You're young. I know how hard this is for you. Because I was young... and I didn't realize how hard it was for you. So where does that leave us? I don't know. I really don't. Maybe we could get breakfast tomorrow before you leave. Yeah. You came back. Biggest moment of my life... June 6, 2007. I was playing on the USC baseball team. Bought a bacon burger from this sassy freshman at the concession stand. (chuckles) I wasn't even hungry. I just bought it 'cause I wanted to talk to the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. What a coincidence. That was my moment, too. So tell me everything. Well, um... Buster Posey was great. Oh, was he nice? He was so nice. I did the little thing. I touched my chain for you. I know, I saw it. ("Relatively Easy" by Jason Isbell playing) ♪ See him walking home again to sleep alone ♪ 
♪ I step into a shop ♪ 
♪ To buy a postcard for a girl ♪ 
♪ I broke the law, boys ♪ 
♪ Shooting out the windows of my loft... ♪ (buzzing) Hello. Hear that? Hear what? Your home run just landed in Long Beach. (scoffs) (sighs) Think I would have done better with you out there. (chuckles) Couldn't have done any worse. Listen, old man, if your bones weren't so brittle, I might be celebrating right now. You should still be celebrating. You're an All-Star. You know how many people in the history of the game can say that? You know what? I'll take that. Mmm. I heard what you said about me. On the air? I wasn't talking about you. I was talking about the other female major-leaguer. How you doing with the whole Mom-Kevin thing? All good. ♪ ♪ How are you doing with the whole catcher coming to take your job thing? I heard he starts in El Paso next week. All good. You still there? Yeah, I'm still here. Oh, okay. Sorry, I-I just thought I lost you for a sec, but it must have been from when that home run bounced off my satellite provider. You're not a good teammate. Never said I was.
