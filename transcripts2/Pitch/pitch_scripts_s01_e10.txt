 Previously on  Pitch... 
 You guys already have a menu for Screwgies? 
 Got to strike while the iron's hot. 
 Come on, Blip. I want to do this. I want to invest. 
 Are we just gonna, like, put off our plan to have another kid? 
 It's not worth your time and your energy. 
 Amelia, that's my brother. I'll always have his back, so you need to get on board with this. 
 There's a big discrepancy here. I mean, that's got to be some kind of error. 
 I set aside 40 grand. 
 What about the other $32,000? 
 Ginny :  Amelia, 
 I need your help with something. 
 We want you on the Cubs, Mike. 
 And in exchange, we want to get you that ring. 
 When it's your time to lead, you can do things differently. 
 I hope you stay, Mike, but if you don't, I'll do exactly that. 
 Rachel :  I'm engaged. 
 You like chasing. The second you get what you want, you figure out a way to throw it away. Uh, I'd love to take you to dinner. That's Noah Casey. He's basically  the Mark Zuckerberg of mo-cap. (phone chimes) I'm sorry, Noah. I-I got to go. Hey, Lawson. (phone buzzes) Okay. I'm not going anywhere. My trade fell through. (applause and cheering) I don't even know what I'm rooting for. You're rooting for her to do it! For her to throw a n... All : Shh! Enberg : Two outs here in the seventh. Baker looks in for the sign from Lawson. Amelia, where are you? Ginny's pitching a n... Don't say it. A very nice game. Get over here. Here's the windup,  the pitch. Salvamini has it. Got him! Grant :  She's through seven! Enberg :  Oh, my! Really? We're doing this? Sonny, come on, talk to me. (laughing): Are you...? Dusty? Fine, be that way. Superstitious wimps. Matt Vasgersian :  Okay, folks. Ginny Baker is now through seven innings. We're gonna go to that broadcast live. Let's join Dick Enberg and Mark Grant on the call. Really amazing stuff. Enberg : If you're wondering why Ginny Baker is on an island all by herself there, it's what baseball tradition is all about. No one talks to her. No one can even mention the words. But with six outs to go, there's only one question on everyone's mind. Is Ginny Baker about to pitch a no-hitter? Oh, thank God. If one more person ignores me, I'm gonna lose my damn mind. Oh, here you go. Hey, so I was... Really? ♪ Have no fear. ♪ (knocking) (sighs) (sniffles) (scoffs) You weren't answering your cell. Uh, maybe because I was sleeping. I... Here. I've waited long enough. I want details. Of what? Of what? (door closes) The electoral map, Ginny. I want details from last night! I don't know. I-I think it got a little weird. Oh. Like... like a good kind of weird, or bad weird? Ooh, is he like a  Fifty Shades of Grey  type billionaire? Oh, Noah? No, it didn't get weird with him. Well, who'd it get weird with? I'm too tired to have this conversation... That's what the coffee's for. Spill. Seriously, spill, or I will. I'm not even kidding. I left halfway through... to go meet Mike. What?! I thought he was out with the guys, and, you know, leaving for Chicago. What? (stammers) Things got weird with Mike?! No. It was... Well, how far did it go? What he... Does the carpet match the face? Ew. No, it wasn't like that. It was... I can't talk about this. No, no, no, I think you can, and I think you will. Now I want details. Vivid, electrifying, specific details. Go. (sighs) There was a hug. Ooh, ah, go on, go on, go on. (clears throat) Sorry. We were hugging good-bye, and there was... a moment. This intense, strange moment. Say more words. And then Oscar called and... told Mike he wasn't being traded, and that was that. Ginny, look at me. I am starving for sexual details outside of my marriage. Now, I want nuance. Was there any brushing of the lips? (laughing): No. No. How close did you guys get? Did you feel his hot, warm man breath on you? What is wrong with you? Can you back up? Amelia : Knock, knock. Come in. This is so not over. Couldn't be more over. Hey. What's up? Nothing. Everything. Oscar : Hey, Beautiful Mind, you mind telling me what's up? We need to shut Ginny down. Huh? Why? She's nowhere near her innings limit. Yeah, or her pitch count. I know. But the screwball is a total variable. Plus, she throws it 48% of the time, which is more than seven percent higher than anybody else throws their specialty pitch. By my estimation, she's actually pitched 70 more innings than her stat sheet says she has, which puts her way over her innings limit. How sure are you about this? What, do you want a percentage? I'd prefer words. Well, I'm better with percentages. Ross. I'm pretty sure. Amelia :  Okay.  A couple of things on the docket. You have the Rachel Patrick interview today at Petco. Rachel Patrick? Ginny's doing an interview with Mike's ex-wife? She's doing an interview with a top journalist about her place in the pantheon of female sports. She just happens to be Mike's ex-wife. She wasn't my first choice, either. I'm also shopping your memoirs. She's 23. Does she even have memoirs yet? She's gonna find 'em in the off-season. And somebody is going to pay you a lot of money to do it. Little girls are gonna eat it up. We also have to map out your appearance schedule. Amelia, I've never had an off-season. You'll have a break. A week, maybe even two. But we cannot take our foot off the pedal right now. Everybody is waiting to hear your message. We'll talk about it later. Hey, we'll talk about that other stuff later. See you at the park. What's going on with Will and the restaurant? I found out who cashed those checks he wrote. Some businessman in Charlotte. So he definitely took the money. (scoffs) Amelia, I so don't want to tell her, or confront him. You don't have to. I will. I'm not sure if that's such a good idea. I know how to speak to Will. Besides, it's my job. (sighs) Yeah, we're not doing that. (laughter) This seat taken? I knew you wouldn't leave. I knew when push came to shove, you couldn't flip on Blip. Yeah. What? Nothing. It was you that called the trade off, right? That's what they said. Well, they say a lot of things. So, it wasn't your call? Hey. Hey. You're back, obviously. Yeah. So, uh, uh... about last night, we don't need to... No. No, definitely not. So... Yeah. Good. Good. Oh. I'm doing an interview with your ex-wife today. Yeah, I know, I know. I talked to the producer about you. Oh, thanks. Yeah. So... We're good? The best. Good. Good. Hey, Ginny, are you...? I'm good! So, you didn't call off the trade. I'm back, aren't I? Yeah, but for how long? (door opens) Mike, need to talk to you. What's going on? I got a recommendation from analytics to shut Ginny down. When? Right away. Mike : Why? Exactly. They're concerned about wear and tear. Nice of those guys to do my job for me. Do those geniuses notice that her velocity's exactly the same? Yes, but apparently, her RPMs are lower. So is my nut sack. Doesn't stop me from getting out of bed in the morning. Well, sometimes it does stop him from getting out of bed in the morning. Mike, I want to hear your opinion as her catcher. As her catcher? Well, as her catcher, I think that you should tell her that her season's over, let her wrap her mind around that for a few days, and then tell all the fans about it, and then change your mind. You seem to be really good at that. (laughing) Mike, this is not about you. I just want to know what you think about shutting her down. Okay. Well, I think she's nowhere near her innings limit, she lost her last start in a heartbreaker, and it'd be a terrible way to end her season. That's what I think. Amen to that. Hmm. Anybody interested in my opinion? 'Cause I happen to be the only one who's actually played a season with her and watched her pitch in September. And? Honestly, she kind of ran out of gas. She overcomes a lot with hard work, but she definitely wore down, so if it were up to me, and I'm thinking about what's best for the team long-term, then... I'd shut her down. Then again, maybe some of us don't care about what's best for the team long-term anymore. That's just one man's opinion. I happen to agree with him. Then we got nothing else to discuss. Yeah. Your tie is weird. (indistinct chatter) Congratulations. You just ended her season. I'm looking out for her. (Mike scoffs) What's going on? They're shutting you down. Why are you shutting me down? Who said anything about shutting you down? We need to shut Ginny down. I'm supposed to have three more starts. Hey, Ross, can you get in here, please? I don't understand. I haven't even reached my innings limit yet. Exactly. I thought we were gonna shut her down in mid-September. I know how my arm feels. It feels as good as it looks. Ross! Hey, give 'em the numbers. Hi. Big fan. Ross, numbers now. Ginny throws her screwball 48% of the time. There were four other guys who threw that percentage of off-speed pitches last season. Guess which list they're on now. Ginny : I'm telling you, I feel fine. Yes, because you're a gamer, and we know this. But wouldn't you rather sit out a few games in September than all of next season because of Tommy John surgery? Charlie : Okay, wait, there's got to be a compromise here. There's also the strain of the screwball itself. Ross, I can't tell you how much I appreciate your dedication. Thank you. See, the issue... This is the point where you stop talking. Gotcha. I've consulted with various people... Right. Of course, none of them was me. Did any of them mention that women's ligaments are different than men's, that there's a different laxity that gives us more flexibility? It doesn't change the numbers. All right, look, well, we're sold out tomorrow, so either way, she has to have one more start. Wow. Okay, limited innings. One more start. Make the most of it. Look, I know this comes as a blow, but we've gotten everything we could have asked for out of this season. I haven't. Just... look at the position we're in. This actually gives us more time to focus on the things we want in the off-season. Like launching a certain restaurant. Good to see you both are so focused on  my  needs right now. Will : G. G, hold up. I know there's money missing from the restaurant fund. I already told Evelyn... I know what you told Evelyn. Don't even bother telling it to me. I know it's a lie. Either you tell Ginny or I will. For the first few weeks of your Major League career, it seemed like everything you did made history. Now, 15 starts later... where do you see your place in history? I... I can't answer that. Are you in the same conversation as Serena Williams and Katie Ledecky? They've won a lot more than I have. Competing against women. Maybe I just belong in a conversation with Blake Snell and Michael Fulmer. Two other 23-year-old rookie pitchers. Well, is that how your teammates view you now? Just as another ballplayer? Or do they still think of you as a woman? I like to think a little... less every day. Mm, thank you. Oh, God, thank  you. I feel like I was here at the beginning. It's nice to have a bookend. Just because you're not moving doesn't mean we can't see you. No, I j... I just didn't want to interrupt. The interview's over. Oh. I'd ask you what it felt like to be grilled by her, but I'm all too familiar. Actually, it wasn't so bad. Really? Find that hard to believe. Well, her answers were way better than yours. (laughs) So, what do you guys do now? You have a postgame ritual? Grab a beer? No, I actually need to... No. Did you... did you need... No, I'm good. Good. You good? I'm good. Good. Thanks again. Yeah. See you. She's great. You didn't have to use a cattle prod on her? Nope. She's much more well behaved than you are. Mike : I miss the cattle prod. Yeah, I know you do. Hmm, let me guess... (Rachel laughs) (takes deep breath) (exhales) Thanks for talking  to my producer, too. Oh. Well, I thought it meant I was going to  avoid  talking to you. (chuckles) I'm glad we can be like this. Yeah. I just want it to be normal. You know... I just want you to be happy, Rach. That's all I've ever wanted, and if David makes you happy... We broke up. A few weeks ago. Um... okay, well, I, um, I should go start my edit. Ah. You're, uh, you're heading off? Yeah. You want something? No, no, no, I don't want to keep you. Beer? Sure. Thanks. Al, I think I lost the team. (groans) The way I handled leaving. Okaying the trade to the Cubs. Even Blip is pissed at me. Yeah, you kind of kicked the hell out of that one. But you'll get 'em back. Especially Blip. I don't know. I'm very good at ruining a good thing. Everything can be going along smoothly, and then I manage to do the wrong thing or... not say the right thing. Well, you're a curmudgeon-y, moody, cranky son of a bitch. (chuckles) Thank you. I learned from the best. But you got a marshmallow center. I know one thing, Mike. You didn't want to leave us; you wanted to stay. Cubs, they were like the new girl... the one makes you laugh and... feel young. And she distracted you from what you really wanted. You went there in a moment of weakness. But this is where your heart is. You came back. That's all that really matters. Besides, the Cubs'll never win it. (quietly): Yeah. (sighs): You got something? I just started. I bailed on him on our first date, and I texted him, and... now he's not replying. Ginny, you just asked me to locate a guy that didn't reply to a text 20 minutes ago. I can't just find him just... (electronic chime) Mm... huh. I know where he is. Eliot : It's a little weird going on your date with you. It's not a date. Right now it's... semi-stalking.

 (whoops) Thank you guys. Thank you. What?! What are you doing here? What am  I  doing here? What are  you  doing here? And where do you get off singing like that? Can I get you a drink? Can I get  you  a drink? Okay. This is now a date. I will see myself out. Noah : How do you even... how do you even become, like, the first female Major League Baseball player? (sighs): My father... would always say to me, the three most important words are "endure, endure, endure." So I could get my screwball down, my control down, my mechanics down, but the ability to endure whatever was thrown at me was going to be what... you know, got me to the bigs. So, what about you? How does somebody become a billionaire in his 20s? How is that possible? Oh, man. (hissing inhale) Well, step one... inherit a billion dollars. Really? No. God. If only. No, I was lucky 'cause I failed a lot before anybody knew who I was. I started five companies before this one. At the other companies, I had all these people looking out for me. All older, more experienced, all with the best of intentions. Sounds familiar. And I didn't want to hurt them or make any waves, so... I'd weigh in, but basically, I just let them call the shots. Then I had this epiphany one day. I just realized... I'm not letting them run things because I don't want to make waves; I'm letting them run things because I'm scared of doing things my own way and failing. But, of course, I was failing anyway. There had to be one voice, my voice. So... I did the thing that... scared me the most. You started calling the shots. No. I wrote a song... and I grabbed my guitar and I went to this... open mic at a super hipster coffee shop, and, holy hell, I sucked... (laughs) so bad, but I did it. And the very next day I started my sixth company. It was just me. And this amazing support system around me, but just... me. That's how you become a billionaire in your 20s, Ginny. You stand in the center of your scariest stage, you sing your song. What if your song is "Uptown Funk"? (A) Cool. (laughs) (B) You just do what I did... You just... keep singing till you don't suck anymore. ♪ ♪ (engine turns off) I got to get home. Oh. All right. (clears throat softly) This was fun. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, see you.

I know you got a break coming up. I think we should go on vacation. Okay. I have a plane and I have a boat. I'm not bragging, I just want you to know all the options here. Also, I'm bragging. Is it working? I can't tell; I'm still half asleep. That's all right. Okay, hear me out here. You know where paparazzi can't get to us? A remote island in the middle of the South Pacific. Or on top of Mount Everest if that's more your thing. You come on really strong. Like my coffee, which I promise I can make for you anywhere in the world except this hotel room. So where are we going? Hold on. Even, even if I wanted to go somewhere with you on your plane... Or boat. I've also got a boat. That has to be said. (laughs) I wouldn't even know where to begin. I've... I've hardly been anywhere. Then let's go everywhere. Okay. If you'll go and get me some coffee downstairs, I'll consider it. (laughing) Did I screw things up for you? By coming over that night? No. But you did get me thinking. I just... I finally had to face the fact that I really, really liked him. I just didn't love him. I'm sorry. Thanks. For lying about being sorry? (laughs) (sighs) I got to get to the park. Oh, and just for the record, I'm not bailing on you. I'm not making a run for it because I got you last night. There's actually a previously scheduled Major League Baseball game that everyone knows about. Duly noted. I could leave a ticket for you if you want. I have a press pass. I could leave a ticket for you, anyway. Yeah. Um... I don't know if that's such a good idea. I-I got to get back to L.A. Mm-hmm. Yeah, right. Okay. I'll see ya. See ya. (elevator bell dings) Are we out any money? No. I think I caught it in time. Wow. Does Ginny know? No. Amelia's gonna tell her. I am so sorry, Evy. 'Cause I know how excited you were about this restaurant. Can I be honest, though? There's a part of me that's relieved. I don't want to postpone having another kid. The boys are almost eight. They need a little brother or a sister. I mean, picture a little beautiful version of you running around. Y'all can have matching outfits going on spa days together. That'd be beautiful. Baby, come on. Let's... let's get back to plan "A." Well, plan "A" was for me to graduate college with a business degree. Not leave after sophomore year. I need to do something for me now. Then we'll postpone... No, babe, you're not hearing me. I think I'm done having kids. Are you serious? Yeah. I still want to open this restaurant. I've done the legwork; I've got the connections. I can do this without Will. What is wrong with people? Since when did everybody stop caring about the way I feel? I don't think a restaurant is a good idea. Okay, Blip, I'm doing this, so you better get your head around it, because the next time I bring this up, I want my husband to support me the same way I've supported him these past nine years: unconditionally and without hesitation. That's the kind of response I'm looking for the next time we speak on this. Will and Ginny (laughing) : And yeah. Oh, stop. Yes. I knew you were gonna cheat. I won. You take the "L." Here, give me this. Hey, um... listen. There's something I need to talk to you about. What's up? It's Amelia. What about her? (scoffs) I don't know what it is, but I think she's got it in for me. You would think I took  you  away from  her,  and not the other way around. What's going on, Will? Nothing. She just has it in her mind there's money missing from the restaurant account. Now, I explained it to Evelyn. She's fine with it, but then Amelia got in my face... What? She got... when? Yesterday. She said that I had to tell you I'm stealing money from you, or she would. Are you? No, I'm not stealing money from you. Like I explained to Evelyn, I put some money aside for promotions. Got this sick deal on kitchen equipment. Kitchen equipment? Yeah. You have receipts. Really? Of course I have the receipts. What kind of question is that? You're lying, Will. You've been lying since you got here. What's going on? (sighs) Will. Tell me. I got in some trouble. All right? (sighs) I had to borrow money for the coffee shop. I couldn't pay it back, so I took just a little bit of money out of the restaurant fund to take care of it, and now I have, okay? And look, I will pay you back every bit of it when the restaurant starts rolling. That's so crazy, all you had to do was ask. I was ashamed, don't you understand? No, Will. I don't understand. You asked for a chance, I gave it to you, and you stole from me. That's what I understand. From now on, no more lies. No, stop. (sighs) You got to go home, Will. I wouldn't be doing you any favors by letting you open a restaurant with my name on it. You need to find your own path. There's no reason... No. Will. I'm out. I'm telling you, I'm out. Go home. Find my brother. I miss him. When you do, I will support you all the way, you know that. Okay. Well, when I do, I won't need your support. Butch : Look at this one. They're going in for a smooch. Ooh... Hey! (cheering) Sonny : It's about damn time. You had us all worried. I thought we were gonna have to take you to some Magic Mike-type place, or something like that. Hey, Lawson, check it out. Ginny finally got some. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Wow. Mike : Nice, Baker. Good for you. Hmm. Hey. I'm sorry about that. What are you apologizing for? It just feels weird, you seeing pictures of me on a date after the other night. I thought we didn't need to talk about that. I didn't think so either, but, I don't know, maybe we should. About what? The fact that two teammates went out for a drink because they thought that one of them was getting traded, and then he ended up not getting traded? 'Cause... 'cause that's what happened. That's what happened? That's what happened. I guess we don't need to talk about it. (muffled music playing over headphones) Want to grab a bite after? There's a new place just opened by my house. Can't. I got to get home, deal with some stuff with Ev. Everything all right? (knocking on door) Just came to check on you. Is there anything you need before you start your routine? Nope. All right. I'll see you later. Yep. Have a great start. Why would you interfere? What? Will's gone; he told me about the money. Why would you interfere? I'm sorry. I specifically asked you to stay away from him. To stay out of my family business. I specifically asked you to do that. Let's talk about this after the game. No, Amelia, we're gonna talk about it right now. He was going to pull you down. So he would have pulled me down, and I would have learned from it. It's my job to make sure that you don't have to learn from it. Your job is to take ten percent of my income and do what I ask you to do. That's your job. When are you gonna realize once and for all, that it's not all about you? Oh, God, Amelia, I know, you're a broken record. If I go down, what? Go ahead, finish it, finish it. If you go down... If you go down, everything that you represent goes down. If I hadn't come along when I did... If you hadn't come along when you did, I would be exactly where I am today. And probably happier. And what female MLB pitcher would you be representing right now? Huh, Amelia? What pitcher? You know, I take this crap from you, Ginny. I take it from you and I take it from you, and I'm not gonna take it much more. Then don't. You know, one day, you're gonna regret this. One day, you're gonna be at your lowest point and you're gonna look up and you're gonna need someone. And it's not gonna be your dead father. And it's not gonna be your con man brother. It's gonna be me. And I'm not gonna be here for you. Yeah, well... (clears throat) (crowd cheering) Enberg :  Ginny Baker, on the mound, is about to make her final bat of the baseball season.

We had a deal. Limited innings. Are you really gonna do this? They're gonna crucify you. Won't be the first time. (line ringing) (phone rings) Can't be good. (sighs) Yeah. Hey, we got to shut her down, Al. Always appreciate a call in the middle of a game, Oscar. (chuckles) We went over this. You know why. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, what do you think? You know what I think. But it's not my ass. That's why you get the big bucks, Al. (chuckles) No, Skip, there's no way I'm not finishing this game. I'm going back out on that mound. You'll have to physically pull me off of it. Strike three! (crowd jeering) Enberg : Here comes Ginny Baker to start the eighth inning. And just listen to this crowd. Yet another chance to witness  her make history. (line ringing) (phone rings) Hello? Enberg :  Baker ready here in the eighth. And here's the pitch. ♪ Girls hit your hallelujah ♪

♪ Come on ♪ (song slowing down and fading) ♪ Hey, hey, hey, oh ♪ (crowd cheering) Enberg :  Way outside. Ball one. That's four pitches in a row nowhere near the plate. You have to wonder if she's running out of fuel. Okay, Baker, you want to talk? Let's talk. You were right. It was completely awkward the other night. I mean, not in comparison to how awkward it's been since then. Now we're bordering on middle school dance territory. It doesn't really matter because... Hey. I... Shut up. Stop trying to distract me from the fact that I'm throwing a no... Don't say it. That's not what I'm doing. Yes, it is. You think I got rattled, so you're coming out here on your white horse to give me one of your great movie speeches. I don't need a speech from you today. I don't need a speech from you or my father or my brother or my agent. And I don't need some billionaire taking me all over the world, as if I've got nothing else to do. He can come watch me train in Arizona if he wants to. I don't need a man to rescue me. I'm the one on the mound right now. Me. I throw the ball, I give the speeches, and I decide if you and I are gonna talk about what happened the other night, not you. And I've decided we're not, by the way, because we're teammates. And as long as we're teammates, that's how it's gonna be. Hey, guys. What's up? Get away! Get away! So, go back to home plate, put down the sign. And let me finish my no-hitter. That's right, I said it. I'm throwing a no-hitter. And if you don't mind, I'd like to keep doing it. Fine by me. Good. Good. Just... I had a really great speech, is the... Go away. Okay. (crowd cheering) ♪ ♪ Enberg :  There we go. That's more like it. Lawson giving chase. He... makes the play. Oh, my, they're all stepping up for Ginny today. Two outs here in the eighth inning. It's a bunt! Baker fields. She got him! What a play. Yes! Yeah! Grant :  Uh-oh. In! In! (Ginny whimpering) All right, hang on. Hang in there. (exclaims) ♪ ♪
