 Daniel Reed. Why are you looking for me? 
 We only wish to speak with you. It's about your father. 
 I came here to find answers. I found out my dad was transferring money - to a man called Mirza Barzani. And when I found out why, it made me sick. To my guts. 
 I want to sleep in the shed. And I need you to lock me in. 
 (Translated from French) : Hey, that's it, all right? On your way. Get out! 
 I see how you look at Alice. You know she's different, don't you? 
 I have a brain tumour. You are looking at a dying man. 
 (She screams) 
 I found something. 
 That's Alice. 
 No. Look at the girl sitting next to her. 
 That's my daughter. That's Alice. 
 No! 
 Sam! 
 Alice! 
 SAM! 
 Alice! 
 (He tunes guitar) 
 (He plays a slow melody) 
 (Music drowns speech) 
 Nadia? 
 Ich wollte sehen, wie's ihnen geht. 
 Hallo? 
 (Phone rings) 
 (He stops playing) 
 Ja? 
 Ja, naturlich, ich bin unterwegs. 
 (Phone rings) 
 'Hello?' 
 Sergeant, apologies for the early hour, I am in Paris and I... 
 'This isn't a good time, Baptiste. Alice is dead.' 
 When? 
 'Last night. She burned to death. 
 'We found petrol canisters inside the shed where she slept.' 
 She used them to start the fire. She killed herself. 
 I'm truly sorry to hear this. 
 What was it you said to her yesterday? 
 I asked her some questions, that is all. 
 'Mr Webster said you started interrogating her, asking questions in French.' 
 And then right after you upset her, she climbed out the window and went missing for three hours. 
 Only to return and take her own life. 
 'But this doesn't make any sense.' 
 She was gone for three hours. Where did she go? 
 We don't know. She didn't say. 
 Coming to terms with what she was about to do, maybe. 
 'So, you said you were in Paris.' 
 Not for long. I will be back today. 
 ♪ Oh, my love ♪ 
♪ We pray each day ♪ 
♪ May you come home ♪ 
♪ And be OK ♪ 
♪ For now we wait for you ♪ 
♪ For you to come home. ♪ 
 You should've stayed away. 
 You're not part of this investigation. 
 And before you ask, we're running DNA to confirm the ID, a familial match against the parents. 
 There's nothing more to be done here. By either of us. 
 Sophie may still be out there, she may still be alive. 
 Kristian Herz isn't talking. 
 And from what Alice said - Sophie didn't have a chance. 
 That is only if we believe everything Alice Webster told us. 
 We'll never get the chance to question her, will we? 
 Not after you went there, and started throwing accusations at her. 
 The time for blame will come, Sergeant. 
 For now, all that matters is the truth. 
 Why did the girl take her own life? 
 Where did she go for three hours? If we can understand this... 
 How can we ever understand what Alice went through? 
 What that does to a person? 
 There is more at play in this case than we know. 
 If I was just allowed to speak with Kristian Herz, please. 
 He's in custody. 
 We'll keep pushing him to tell us where Sophie is, but we don't need your help. 
 Go home. 
 Sir, this way, please. 
 Matthew! Where have you been? I've been calling. 
 I was there till the fire went out. 
 Then... 
 I don't know, I was just... 
 She's gone. 
 (He sobs) 
 How's Dad? 
 The doctors said the burns are worst on his back. 
 They cleaned him up in the emergency room, and now he's on painkillers and antibiotics. 
 He's going to be all right. 
 I'm sorry. She asked me. She begged me. I didn't know... 
 I don't know how it happened. I never meant... 
 (Murmuring) 
 What's that? 
 What did you say, love? 
 Get out. 
 No, Matthew... Matthew! 
 She had brown hair, an English girl, 21 or so. 
 She would be here buying petrol in a canister. 
 Yes. Yes, I see this woman. She wears a... 
 A hat. Like a baseball cap? 
 Did you see where she came from? 
 Through those trees. No car. 
 But...this is what I tell your colleague just now. 
 What is it they say? Great minds? 
 Perhaps - once upon a time. 
 Do not be so modest. I googled you. 
 No-one is safe any more. 
 Well, I am glad someone else feels it is worthwhile tracking Alice Webster's movements yesterday. 
 Three hours to be gone is a long time. 
 The Bundespolizei were all over Eckhausen looking for her. 
 Which suggests she did not want to be found. 
 The girl was hiding something. This was her last stop before home. 
 So the question is... 
 What she did in the two hours before she came to the petrol station. 
 May I? 
 So. The average walking speed is 2.8mph. 
 She went through that field. That way lies Eckhausen. 
 So...there is the search zone. 
 Are there any cameras in Eckhausen? 
 CCTV, security, traffic? 
 Well, not as many as in Paris, but, yes. We have some. 
 We start there. 
 We? Together? 
 If everyone helps to hold up the sky, then one person doesn't get tired. 
 And you say you are not a great mind. 
 Sadly I cannot take credit for that. 
 Do you know who said it? 
 Who? 
 Google it. 
 Mr Herz. 
 It's funny. 
 There isn't a speck of dust on this floor. 
 They clean my cell more than I clean my own house. 
 It's not the place that's filthy. 
 Why are you here? 
 Your wife... she was attacked last night. 
 She... Is she...? 
 She's in a coma. 
 Can I see her? 
 Not unless you tell us where Sophie Giroux is. 
 But...how can I? I don't know anything. 
 It's funny, you almost make yourself seem human. 
 Maybe if you confessed, someone wouldn't have gone after her. 
 Maybe she'd still have her teeth. 
 (He sobs) 
 Christ. How many photos did you go through? 
 There must have been thousands. 
 This girl's face is a blur... her hair's all over the place. 
 It's my daughter. 
 The picture's really not that clear. 
 I want to go there. To the park. 
 Maybe somebody saw the two of them together. Maybe somebody... 
 Are you saying that the girl who came back - the girl you took into your house - are you saying that wasn't your daughter? 
 We wanted to believe it. OK? 
 We wanted to believe it so badly that we just...shut our eyes. 
 Mrs Webster... 
 But a part of me knew. The way she talked. 
 The look in her eye. 
 He could see it. That detective, Baptiste. 
 Even if it was true - how does it help us now? 
 I don't know. But it must mean something. 
 I'd go myself, but no-one's going to listen to me. 
 I have no authority outside the Army. 
 But you know what to look for. You know who to ask. 
 My dad's nurse quit. I've got no-one to look after him. 
 I'm sorry. 
 The garrison's only up the road, I suppose I could get someone to...come by. 
 Thank you. 
 So, will your husband be joining us? 
 No. I didn't tell Sam. We don't talk about Alice. 
 We don't talk about anything much these days. 
 'O'Sullivan.' 
 Hi, it's Eve Stone. 
 'How can I help?' 
 Yeah, I need a favour... 
 (Gunfire and shouting) 
 Julien! We've got to keep moving. We need to go. 
 Out into the crossfire? 
 The Peshmerga has started to fall back. We should go. 
 The question is to risk our lives on...on fate or chance. 
 It's hard not to think of those girls, kept in that basement. 
 Scared of the world outside. 
 Somebody builds a wall around you, and... soon you start to build your own. 
 (Gunfire continues) 
 (Explosion) 
 We have to go. Come on! 
 (Explosion) 
 You two, over here. This way, move! Go! Go! 
 (Screaming) 
 Staff Sergeant Eve Stone, of the Military Police out of Eckhausen. 
 We called ahead. We're meeting Dieter Ackermann? 
 Ich habe hier zwei frauen fur Sie. 
 (Indistinct reply) 
 OK. He's just coming. 
 Thank you. 
 Sergeant Stone? 
 (Phone rings) 
 Hello. 
 So sorry, excuse me. 
 Stone? 
 'It's O'Sullivan. Look, I know I said I'd look in on your father, but I've been called to a disturbance.' 
 I understand. Don't worry about it. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Hey. 
 'Sam.' 
 We still meeting later? 
 'It's not about that. It's my dad.' 
 I need you to...go round to my house and keep an eye on him. 
 I thought that wasn't what this is. 
 'His nurse quit. He can't look after himself.' 
 Why can't you do it? I'm working on the car. 
 I just can't. 
 OK? 
 Please. 
 Yeah, all right. I'll go round now. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sorry. The rollercoaster is the only ride we do with... photographs. You understand? 
 What about CCTV? Security cameras? 
 We have dummies, but they do not film. 
 We are small, privately run... 
 There must be something. 
 I'm sorry. I do not... 
 Thank you, anyway. 
 We should go. My dad's... 
 Well...maybe if we ask around? Maybe somebody saw something. 
 Isn't it worth trying? Just in case? 
 Sure. OK. Let's ask. 
 Thank you. 
 (TV on) 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 (Gunfire) 
 We need to keep moving. 
 OK. 
 Let's go. Go go go go! 
 Come on. Julien... 
 No, no, no. Julien, it's the Peshmerga. 
 (He speaks to him in Kurdish) 
 Come away. Julien, that's fine. The Peshmerga. The Peshmerga, OK? 
 (Engine starts) 
 To the airport, yes? 
 Yeah. 
 Going somewhere nice? 
 Going somewhere else. 
 (Inaudible conversation) 
 How are you feeling? 
 If she hadn't walked out of that basement she might be alive today. 
 And what kind of life would that be? 
 They're saying she did it. 
 She took the petrol in there. They found a canister. 
 She killed herself. 
 She was locked in! 
 Even if she had second thoughts, maybe... 
 We can't think like that, it's... 
 I can think the way I want. 
 ..poisonous. 
 How could he do that? How could he lock her in there? After all she'd been through. 
 Sam, it is not Matthew's fault... 
 He knows what he did. 
 You both do. 
 What do you mean? 
 She came home, she needed support. She needed her family. 
 She was so different... 
 You called her a liar! 
 That is not what I said. 
 She heard what you said, Gemma, and that's why she did it. 
 That's why she killed herself. 
 Do you remember, when she was born, how long it took her to get off to sleep? 
 No. Cos you weren't there. It was me. 
 It was me, holding her. Night after night, singing to her. 
 Holding on to her little hand. 
 I know my daughter! 
 And that girl, that girl that came back? 
 That was not her... that was not my Alice! 
 NO! Don't you DARE! 
 Don't you DARE say that to me now! 
 Don't you dare say that to me... 
 Hey. Thanks for meeting me. I got you one of these. 
 No caffeine. 
 Of course. Remind me never to get pregnant. 
 I got a call from a journalist asking about Alice Webster. 
 Jesus. 
 It's out there now. It's going to be a global news piece. 
 The press are onto Nadia Herz's assault. They're joining the dots. 
 Asking if Matthew Webster could have been involved. 
 I said no comment, but... 
 If they're not given a story, they make one up. 
 I know. 
 So...what do you want me to do? 
 Talk to the families. Get drafting a statement. 
 Yeah...right, right. 
 I know, it's the last thing they need right now. 
 But I'd rather they control the story here. 
 In the meantime, I'll speak to Matthew Webster. 
 Of course. 
 I don't want them getting sandbagged by questions. 
 Not after what's happened to them. 
 Mrs Webster? 
 Adam Gettrick from the Army Press Office. 
 They know, don't they? 
 About Alice? 
 Not for sure. 
 But they know something's going on. 
 I don't know how - someone in the hospital, or...one of the German police speaking out of turn... 
 Everyone stops to watch the car crash, don't they? 
 See the blood on the road. 
 We should think about making a statement. 
 I can draft something. 
 If that would help. 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 Mrs Webster... if we don't make a statement... they won't leave you alone. 
 I said I don't want to talk about her. 
 
 
 
 (Candy wrapper crinkles) 
 I thought with this kind of time-frame it wouldn't take so long to find something. 
 It depends if there is anything to find. 
 It's like waiting for Hilde to talk. 
 What? 
 When I was a child, my mother bought me a parrot. 
 Hilde, it was called. 
 Every day, I come home from school, waiting for this bird to say a word. 
 And every day...nothing. 
 So, waiting for Hilde to talk, we used to say. 
 And did she ever talk? 
 Not a word. 
 When I first began this job, I thought it would all be exciting. 
 I soon realised what it was - sifting through the earth, grain by grain. 
 But the devil is in the detail, and... 
 What? 
 Sometimes Hilde talks. 
 Go back, please. 
 There. There she is. 
 Go forward. 
 There are no other cameras? 
 With a view that leads on from here? 
 Can you play it slowly? 
 Where was she going? 
 You should not be here. 
 It was your units. Your men brought us here. 
 Rat-a-tat-a-tat. You get shot. Understand? 
 Yes. 
 ISIL, they will come back. 
 They come back... and you get shot. 
 I understand. 
 We get it. 
 You too. Rat-a-tat-a-tat. 
 We just wish to return to Erbil. 
 OK. We will arrange. Let's go. 
 Come on, follow me. Let's go. 
 Was it worth it? 
 Excuse me? 
 Coming all this way. Nearly getting killed. 
 I told myself I wouldn't rest until I find the man who took Sophie Giroux and Alice Webster. 
 Well, I'm sorry that all this was for nothing. 
 Perhaps. 
 Daniel said his father was sending money to a man called Mirza Barzani. 
 (Phone dials) 
 I think we should find out why. 
 'Hello, Detective Lenhart.' 
 Jorn, it's Baptiste. 
 'Julien.' 
 I need your help finding someone. 
 How are you doing, sir? Can I get you anything? 
 Captain Webster. Honourable Tank Regiment. 
 Yes, sir. That's me. 
 Your boys came under fire in 2010. Basra. 
 Yes, sir. I was on patrol. 
 Three souls. 
 I'm sorry about what happened to your daughter. 
 Thank you. 
 She was very young...I remember. 
 Taken outside the school. 
 She was... She liked spiders. 
 An alternative sort. 
 She was called... 
 She was... 
 Alice. 
 Alice Webster. Yes. 
 I wouldn't forget that, Captain. 
 I wonder if they'll ever find out what happened to her. 
 She died, sir. 
 Took her own life. 
 What makes you think you're fit to join the military, then, son? 
 (Screams and laughter) 
 (Fairground ride rattles) 
 You've never seen either of these girls? 
 No. 
 Are you sure? 
 Sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 So you haven't seen either of these girls? 
 They might have been with an older man? 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 None of them? 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 Nothing? 
 Sorry. 
 I know you think this whole thing is pointless. 
 I didn't say that. 
 You didn't have to. 
 But the thing is you do anything for your kids, absolutely anything. 
 Have you ever thought about having kids? A family of your own? 
 It just...never happened. Always moving around. 
 Maybe one day. 
 Not... God knows when. 
 Well. 
 We all find a way to survive, don't we? 
 It's all right. All right, stand up. 
 There you go. 
 I'm sorry, I... 
 It's fine. 
 I'll be back in a minute. 
 (Water runs) 
 I don't know what happened. 
 It's fine, honestly, don't think about it. Really. 
 You're a good lad. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Let's find you something to wear, shall we? 
 She always wanted a family. 
 It hit her hard, you know? 
 Park's closing up. We should be heading off. 
 He's been happier recently, you know. 
 What? 
 Sam. 
 He's been happier. 
 Lately. 
 Right? 
 I don't... 
 Come on. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know, when Alice was taken... we fell apart at the seams. 
 All three of us. Together. 
 But it did make us stronger. 
 It did, because what we lost in Alice we still had in each other. 
 We had that love that you only keep for your family. 
 And when she walked back into our lives... we fell apart all over again. 
 It just... happened. 
 This isn't about you. Is it? 
 Don't tell Sam I know, will you? 
 He still loves you. 
 Oh, right! 
 Fine. Really. 
 Well, even if that's true... what does it bloody matter? 
 Julien? 
 Julien. 
 Julien, are you OK? 
 Sometimes I get headaches. 
 Your friend found Mirza Barzani fast. 
 We should be there soon. 
 'Julien?' 
 (In French) : 
 (Choir sings) 
 I wonder if you can help us. 
 We're trying to find this girl. 
 She might have passed here yesterday between four and six o'clock. 
 Oh, yeah, I remember her. She came in here. 
 She did? What did she want? 
 Statice flowers. 12 of them. 
 Purple. And then she asked me the way to the graveyard, of course. 
 Why "of course"? 
 These are flowers for remembrance. 
 Usually we put these on a grave, you see, so... 
 She seemed so sad, this girl. 
 (Indistinct tannoy announcement) 
 (Journalists clamour) 
 Matthew? 
 Do you mind if I sit down? 
 Matthew, Kristian Herz' wife, Nadia, was found beaten half to death last night. 
 She's in the ICU in a coma right now. 
 OK. 
 It's unlikely to be a coincidence that the wife of the man who abducted your sister be brutally beaten the day of his arrest. 
 You think... You think it was me? 
 I didn't say that. 
 But I'd like to know where you were last night. 
 That man - Kristian - he's the one that took Alice. 
 Why would I attack his wife? That doesn't make any sense. 
 I'm not accusing you, Matthew. I'm on your side. 
 But if you know something... 
 How can you come here, while my sister's just... 
 Matthew, just calm down. 
 She's gone! I haven't done anything wrong. She done it to herself. 
 Why can't you just leave us alone! 
 (She gasps) 
 Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. 
 I didn't mean to hurt you, honestly, I was just trying to get past. 
 I'm fine. 
 Sergeant Stone, I am so, so sorry. I'll find a doctor. 
 It's OK. 
 (Phone vibrates) 
 Hello? 
 All right, thanks for letting me know. 
 Where's your mum? 
 Mrs Webster? 
 The DNA results are back on the remains in your shed. 
 We ran them against your husband. 
 It's a confirmed match with your daughter. 
 It's... 
 It's really Alice? 
 It's really my Alice, you're sure? 
 I'm sorry, but yes. 
 I just... I thought you should know. 
 Are you sure you're ready? 
 Mrs Webster, Mrs Webster, where is Alice now? 
 Mrs Webster... 
 (All clamour) 
 Mrs Webster will make a short statement. 
 There will be no questions. 
 My daughter, Alice Webster, was abducted in 2003. 
 And four days ago, she came back to us. 
 I know there'll be a lot written about this - what happened to my daughter is one of those things, one of those... horrible things that you read about in the newspaper and you say, "That's awful." 
 But really you're thinking... "I'm glad it's not me." 
 And no matter what gets written... you'll never understand... what it's like to resign yourself to never seeing someone you love ever again. 
 And when they come back... you can't believe it. 
 I couldn't. 
 It was her, and... I just couldn't believe it. 
 My daughter...wasn't just.... a name for your headlines. 
 She was a girl. 
 She was our girl. 
 And we loved her. 
 Mrs Webster... 
 Mrs Webster, do you know who found her? 
 As I said, no questions. 
 (All clamour) 
 Julien? 
 Julien? 
 Julien? 
 Did you not hear me shout? 
 I was miles away, forgive me. These places, well... 
 Some find them to be peaceful. Myself, I find it hard. 
 All these lives, laid bare - everything they stood for reduced to a few words on a tombstone. 
 A novel abridged to a haiku. 
 I think I have found the flowers. 
 They look fresh, too, unlike the others. 
 They could have been bought yesterday. 
 So she runs from her family, disappears without a word. 
 And while the entire police department searches for her, she finds the time to buy flowers and visit a grave before going home to do what she did. 
 Who is this man? 
 Henry Reed. 
 And why did she need to see him before she took her own life? 
 (He speaks Kurdish) 
 Mirza Barzani? 
 (He speaks Kurdish) 
 Do you speak English? 
 Bristol University. Three years. 
 Our exhibits are displayed in chronological order, starting with the Palaeolithic age, down there... moving into the ancient civilisations of Mesopotamia and ending on the right side in the period of Abbasid. 
 Although, I can see from your faces you do not seem interested in what the past has to offer... 
 Far from it. The past is exactly the reason we are here. 
 Only not this far back. 
 A man who was living in Germany would send regular payments to you. 
 His name was Henry Reed. 
 We are trying to find out why. 
 Henry Reed. 
 You are not the first person to come and ask about him. 
 You spoke to his son Daniel over a year ago or so. 
 And I will tell you the same thing that I told him. 
 Henry Reed made those payments out of guilt. 
 Guilt? For what? 
 For what they did to my sister. 
 She was only nine years old. 
 And this Henry Reed thinks money will, what? Make it better? 
 Bring her to life? They killed MY father... 
 Mr Barzani, please. Slow down. 
 Would you mind to tell me everything you know, from the beginning? 
 In 1991, I was just a boy. 
 That's when they came to my village... 
 Who? 
 Henry Reed. And his Army friend. 
 A man called Stone. 
 (How was he?) 
 (Yeah, he's fine.) 
 Thank you. 
 It's fine. 
 Where did you go? 
 Just...work. Something came up. 
 Look, um... 
 Your dad had a bit of an accident. 
 I went into one of the drawers in your bedroom, just looking for something for him to wear... 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 I, uh... 
 I found the pictures. You know, the scans, of the baby... 
 So? 
 So it's a huge part of your life and we've never really talked about it. 
 And I just think maybe you should be with someone else. 
 You know... 
 Someone who can give you what you want. 
 You don't know what I need. 
 It's not like we haven't been honest with each other. 
 We needed each other. 
 Someone to hold on to in the middle of all the... 
 But now... 
 I'm sorry, I'm not good at this. 
 It's fine. 
 I've been thinking the same. 
 It's not right, what we've been doing. We need to stop. 
 The doc says that me and Gemma could go back to England. 
 Make a fresh start. 
 I wonder whether he's right. 
 You've been through it, you two. 
 You deserve to be happy. 
 Julien. Julien. 
 I think the flight's on time. You should check in. 
 Thank you again. For all your help. 
 I'd say it was my pleasure, but... 
 You know you should go home. You can have that operation. 
 Not just run and hide from it. 
 Says the man who refuses to go home, even when asked by his employer. 
 I know. I know. But that's different. 
 You know, I've had chemotherapy. Radiotherapy too. 
 I have had hope and had it snatched from me all in the same week. 
 In truth, I'm tired. Perhaps I've had my time. 
 But if there is a chance the real Alice Webster is still alive I must do everything in my power to find her. 
 To do nothing or do something, right? 
 Yes. It's no choice at all. 
 Goodbye. 
 Farewell, my friend, good luck. 
 (Ringing tone) 
 'Hello?' 
 Hello, Eve, it's Gemma. 
 'I know this is awkward, but there's no-one else I can...' 
 Can we meet? Tonight. 
 'I can't. I'm with my dad.' 
 Tomorrow morning? 
 What is it? What's it about? 
 You know what I said earlier on about not seeing something that's right in front of you. 
 Well, I was right. 
 We weren't looking hard enough, Eve. 
 There was another girl. 
 Voila. 
 (Translated from French) : I'm afraid I'm taken.
