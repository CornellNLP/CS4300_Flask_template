 I was just a boy when they came to my village. 
 Who? 
 Henry Reed. 
 With his army friend, a man called Stone. 
 It's Brigadier now, Nadia. 
 Sorry - force of habit. 
 Do you know Mrs Herz? 
 I have had the pleasure. Back in Iraq, she was a mess. 
 Who was with you? Who was it, Mr Stone? 
 Give me the name! 
 (In German : He attacked me. He hurt me. 
 He was confused. 
 I found pictures, Kristian. Pictures of the girl. 
 People need to know who you are. 
 No-one here believes a word you say. What are you doing? 
 I couldn't lie in a hospital, waiting for the devil to take me. 
 What did you do to my sister? Go on! 
 You got hurt. You have fractured ribs. Don't try and move. 
 You should come down to the station and turn yourself in. 
 For what you did to my dad. 
 'You're lost.' 
 I am not lost, Miss Stone. I know exactly where I am. 
 I believe that finding out the truth of what happened all those years ago in Iraq, will help explain why Alice Webster was taken. 
 And, more importantly, who it was that took her. 
 I'll tell you what I know. 
 This was us back then. 
 Me, Henry Reed, Adrian Stone. 
 Christ. 
 I don't even remember this photo being taken. 
 Why do you keep looking out there? 
 Please. Keep talking. 
 Tell me what happened with Adrian Stone and Henry Reed. 
 Stone talked about "the three of us". Who did he mean? 
 You know what I'm talking about. Don't you, Mrs Herz? 
 I have a witness. Still in Iraq. Mirza Barzani. 
 I can take this to the military courts. 
 I can take it to the press. 
 But... time is not on my side. And I want the truth. 
 I've never told anyone this. 
 Then, is it not time that you did? 
 My time in the Gulf was... difficult. 
 I was promoted too soon, younger than most people I was commanding. 
 Drinking the days away, not sleeping, wired. 
 Years later, I was diagnosed with Gulf War Syndrome. 
 But at the time... 
 At the time, I just shut my mouth, like a good soldier. 
 Ma'am. 
 Captains Stone and Reed to see you, ma'am. 
 Wait! 
 Send them in. 
 Captain Stone, the major will see you now. 
 Yeah? 
 Lieutenant Gettrick's been outside the wire four days now. 
 We need to take some troops and look for him. 
 He's gone walkabout. 
 Isn't that what you're all doing? 
 Going out and banging the locals before going home to your wives and girlfriends? 
 With respect... 
 With respect, Adrian, he's a big boy. 
 He knows we're being relieved in two days. 
 He'll come back when he remembers that and realises just how many STDs he's racked up. 
 Last thing I need is even more of you buggering off to indulge yourselves. 
 Stay put. That's a bloody order, Oké? 
 But, ma'am... 
 I don't remember asking for your opinion, Captain Stone. 
 Get out. 
 Reed and Stone came to me for help, looking for Adam, and I... 
 ..I told them no. 
 I thought he was out having fun like the rest of them. 
 If I'd had any idea... 
 The war was over, but it was far from safe. 
 But Adrian was always a reckless b*st*rd. 
 He took Henry Reed and went out to find Adam Gettrick, against my orders, with no back up and only each other for protection. 
 Relax. 
 Why? 
 First we jump the wire, then we nick a translator's car to do it. 
 You medics worry too much. 
 You don't worry enough. 
 Do you even know where he went? 
 It was a house he showed me on patrol. 
 Girl he was seeing. We start there, find out what the girl knows. 
 American? British? 
 I'm Captain Stone. I'm looking for my friend of mine. 
 Adam Gettrick. 
 Leave it. 
 I found him in bed with my daughter. 
 You know how old my daughter? 
 13. And I tell him get out. Just like I tell you. 
 And he ran off. 
 I tell him never come back. 
 Oké, then. 
 Jesus. 
 Did you see that tattoo on his hand? 
 Republican Guard. 
 So? 
 The war's over. 
 I'm just wondering. 
 A guy like that finds Adam with his 13-year-old daughter and he just lets him go? 
 13. Christ. Did you have any idea she was that young? 
 Of course I didn't! 
 13's not much older than Eve. 
 We can't take his word for it. Not someone like that. 
 We need to get a look inside that house. 
 For all we know, Adam could be shacked up with someone else. 
 You saw how he acted back there. Do you really believe that? 
 Look, if you're right, if that guy's done something with Adam, then... we're out on our own. 
 Adam's one of us, Henry. If he's in trouble, he needs our help. 
 I say we wait. 
 Wait for our chance to get in. 
 How long? 
 As long as it takes. 
 ♪ Oh, my love ♪ 
♪ We pray each day ♪ 
♪ May you come home ♪ 
♪ And be Oké ♪ 
♪ For now we'll wait ♪ 
♪ For you, for you ♪ 
♪ To come home. ♪ 
 (Door opens) 
 (They argue) 
 Maybe we should go after her. Ask her about Adam. 
 (Hold on.) 
 I say now's our chance to get in there. 
 While he's still inside? 
 Well, he's not going anywhere and we need to get in! 
 If Adam had really been turned away, he would have come back to camp by now. 
 This is wrong. This is all wrong. 
 That's why we're here. To make whatever this is right. 
 (Come on!) 
 Reed. 
 IN ARABIC: Get the hell out! 
 Back off, Stone. 
 (Reed. Here.) 
 Jesus. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 Bloody hell, Gettrick. Let's get you out of here, eh? 
 He's barely breathing. We need to check the extent of his injuries. 
 Help me put him on his side. 
 (He moans) 
 Can you hear me, Adam? 
 Stone? I'm here. Me and Reed. You're going to be Oké. 
 (Clanging) 
 (Footsteps) 
 Jesus Christ! 
 (Mumbles) : The key, he has it. 
 He has it. 
 We need to get out of here. 
 I know! 
 Get him on his feet. 
 No-one can know we were here. 
 (Adam groans and yells) 
 She was 13! What the hell was he thinking?! 
 Leave off! 
 (Sobs) : Where... where is the rest of the unit? 
 We went to Nadia. She ordered us to stay put. 
 Come on. We've got to go! 
 I've been gone four days! 
 That bitch has slept through the last week, why... why would she give an order like that? 
 Did she want me to die out here? Four f*cking days! 
 She should have had people looking for me. 
 She was supposed to protect us! We have to get out of here! 
 We decided it would be best not to let Command know what had happened to Adam. 
 If they learned how I'd been running the camp, what a shit-show I'd made of it... 
 I let them all run riot. 
 And then when Adam Gettrick needed me, I didn't send help. 
 Adam Gettrick. 
 The third person Stone spoke of is Adam Gettrick. 
 He got taken on my watch. 
 That's all you know? 
 What do you mean? 
 Mirza, the boy they let escape, from Iraq. 
 He told us everything he saw. 
 The events that followed, after what happened in that house. 
 And you should know the truth. 
 (Boy yells in Arabic) 
 It's Oké, it's Oké. 
 Stone, there's another girl in the house! 
 (He sobs) 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 I'm so, so sorry. 
 (Explosion) 
 We have to go. Now! 
 What is your name? Your full name? 
 Mirza Barzani. Reed! 
 (He yells) 
 How old was the little girl? 
 Nine years old. 
 But nobody believed it was done by English soldiers in the middle of the night. 
 He was an imaginative child. 
 The father, a drunk. 
 It was thought to be an accident. 
 They told me what had happened to Adam. 
 They told me what they did to the man who hurt him. 
 And I kept quiet. 
 You knew they killed a man and you said nothing? 
 Men had died. 
 Better men than the one they killed - one of Saddam's. 
 And like I say, I wasn't there. 
 I mean, I was, but I was... 
 I was in pain and I was numbing it with drink and pills. 
 My mind had gone AWOL. 
 If it got out, it'd undo everything we did out there. 
 I gave them an alibi. 
 But I... 
 I had no idea... 
 No idea about the girl. I swear. 
 Tell me about Adam. 
 He... he got injured in Afghanistan in 2001. 
 They offered him a medical discharge, but he chose to stay with the Army. 
 They moved him sideways. Ended up as press liaison. 
 Have you ever had any sense of... 
 ..another side to him? 
 His life? 
 That he might be capable of taking someone? 
 I don't understand. 
 Taking who? 
 Alice Webster and Sophie Giroux. 
 But my husband... 
 They found him guilty. It was... 
 There were pictures on the camera. It was my husband. 
 Your husband was a prominent figure in the community, yes? 
 Did Adam Gettrick ever come to the shop? 
 Er, yes. Sometimes, I suppose. 
 He would have known your husband's hobby. Bird-watching. 
 Most people did. 
 So he knew your husband was often away. 
 And it seems likely he bore a grudge against you, that he blamed you for what happened to him. 
 You're saying he framed my husband? 
 Well, that can't... That's impossible. It can't be true. 
 Just because you're tortured, it doesn't mean... you abduct two little girls and keep them prisoner in your house. 
 Of course not. 
 Adam Gettrick was a monster long before he entered that basement. 
 I've told you everything I know. 
 Now get out of my house! 
 I'm sorry to have upset you, Mrs Herz. 
 You should know only that I believe your husband. 
 And perhaps with luck, he will one day be a free man. 
 I said get out! 
 (Door closes) 
 (She sobs) 
 (Footsteps) 
 I'm just going down the shops. Do you want anything? 
 No. 
 So, do you want me to leave the house or, you know...? 
 I meant to show you this the other day, but... 
 Well... 
 Now look at that... 
 ..and tell me that I'm crazy. 
 Where did you get this? 
 Julien Baptiste and Jorn Lenhart... 
 But it doesn't matter where it came from. 
 Look at it. 
 Look at that and tell me that that's not our daughter. 
 That's our girl. 
 This girl sitting next to her, that could be anybody. No. 
 No, Sam. That is Alice. 
 And that girl came back to live here, in our house. 
 That's an impostor. 
 You're just seeing what you want to see. And you're not? 
 You know I'm right. 
 You know I am, deep down you must do. 
 And even if you didn't in the beginning, by the time she set fire to that shed, you knew. 
 Why are you doing this to yourself? 
 It's destroying you. 
 I told Eve to keep the baby. 
 Why? 
 I don't understand. 
 This is her decision. 
 Why would you do that? 
 This is your mess. 
 It was an accident. 
 Yeah. You didn't mean to get her pregnant. 
 Sure. I know that. 
 You didn't mean to have an affair right under my nose. 
 But it happened. 
 And there are consequences. 
 You know how much I wanted another baby. 
 Maybe if we'd got out of this place... 
 I wasn't ready to leave. 
 I don't know if we can come back from this... 
 ..but I want to try. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But it's too late. 
 (Door opens, slams shut) 
 Matthew! 
 What's wrong? 
 I'm just tired. That's all. 
 Who were you out with last night? 
 A friend. Yeah, but which friend? 
 All of a sudden you give a sh1t? 
 Hey. Hey! 
 What's that? What happened? 
 You done? Cos I'm tired. 
 
 
 
 (Footsteps) 
 Mr Baptiste. 
 Please. Sit. We don't have long. 
 What? Take a seat, Mr Gettrick. 
 You are not a stupid man, so I will not treat you as such. 
 To do what you have done all these years - to pull the wool over the eyes of the world is no small feat. 
 Why did you tell Sophie to pretend she was Alice Webster? 
 I'm sorry. I'm not sure... 
 We do not have time for this. 
 I need to know if the real Alice Webster is still alive. 
 You've made a mistake, Mr Baptiste. 
 Now... I only came down here as a courtesy... 
 I know what happened back in 1991, in Iraq. 
 I know your taste in women. 
 Or girls, I should say. 
 I know you had access to everything we did during this investigation. 
 They arrived sooner than I'd anticipated. 
 With respect, it sounds like you don't have a damn clue, Detective. 
 Aren't you seeing things? 
 Hallucinating. 
 I heard what you did at the cookhouse. 
 (He laughs) 
 Yes! 
 I am seeing things - clearly - for the first time in a long time. 
 Your mind is more diseased than my own. 
 Tell me, what have you done with Alice? 
 Why would you say such an awful thing to me? 
 What gives you the right to accuse me? 
 I know it was you. 
 I'm coming, but I ask that you take this man into custody also. 
 On what grounds? On the grounds that he abducted Sophie Giroux and Alice Webster. 
 I honestly have no idea what he's going on about. 
 He asked to see me and then he's just started accusing me. 
 Started calling me Kristian Herz, like he thinks I'm him or something. 
 You need to come with us. We need to ask you some questions. 
 You're making a big mistake, Sergeant! 
 It's not a request. 
 I'm coming. 
 Don't touch me! 
 Staff Sergeant Stone has informed me you are not well, that you are seeing things that are not there, that there have been aggressive outbursts. 
 I am of sound mind. Believe me. 
 But this is a matter of some urgency. 
 The abduction of Alice Webster - I don't believe Kristian Herz to be responsible. 
 I believe it was another man - Adam Gettrick. 
 He is the press liaison for the garrison. 
 Mr Baptiste, you went to speak with Adrian Stone last night? 
 Listen, whatever it is you think... 
 And you were ejected for aggravating him. He is in hospital now. 
 His injuries are severe. 
 You cannot think me responsible... 
 You are a detective. 
 You tell me how this looks. 
 You were the last to see him. 
 You were found physically harassing him... 
 He attacked me! I was defending myself. 
 So that is your position, you were defending yourself? 
 I didn't put him in the hospital. 
 He says you did. 
 He is confused! 
 With respect, Mr Baptiste, so are you. Confused and angry. 
 You need to bring in Adam Gettrick. 
 Alice herself identified Herr Kristian Herz. 
 It wouldn't be the first thing that girl lied about. 
 Mr Baptiste, I have great respect for all the work you have done in your life. 
 And what happened last night, I do not believe it was intended. 
 But you are ill. 
 The courts will understand that. 
 But first you have to confess to what you have done. 
 Arrest me, or bring me a lawyer. Everything else is wasting time. 
 Very well, Mr Baptiste. Then you will be our guest this evening. 
 Vous faites perdre le temps de tout le monde, vous etes tout incapable! 
 Alter, kranker spinner. 
 Imbeciles! 
 (Door closes) 
 (Ringing tone) 
 Yeah, I need you to get me a number. 
 Celia Baptiste. 
 We don't have to do this. 
 They're being re-deployed tomorrow, Sam. 
 They're your men. 
 You know we have to do this. 
 All right, then, we go in and we show our faces and then we leave. 
 No-one needs to know about us. All right? 
 Oi-oi! 
 Picked a great day for it, eh? 
 (Music playing) : Rock The Casbah by The Clash 
 (Murmur of conversation) 
 Sorry. 
 I didn't know you were going to be here. 
 Melissa and I are old friends. 
 We were at Aldershot together. 
 Right. 
 Yeah. So... 
 I should probably just... 
 We're going to have to learn how to deal with each other, aren't we? 
 Especially when you start showing. 
 It shouldn't be too complicated, though, cos... it's over between me and Sam, so... 
 Just so you know - that doesn't mean that me and Sam will... 
 I really don't care if it does, Eve. 
 Well, I do. And I'm sorry. 
 It sounds... 
 But... 
 I shouldn't have come. 
 My dad's lying in a hospital bed because a couple of nights ago, someone came and beat him half to death at the care home. 
 Christ. 
 Do they know who did it? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Excuse me. 
 What's wrong, Lucy? 
 I left Mr Squibbles at home. 
 Because you made us leave so quickly. 
 Well, we can't go back. 
 We're going to the new house sooner than we thought. 
 You'll like it there. 
 I like Mr Squibbles. 
 Well, we'll find you a new toy. 
 It won't be the same. 
 It's the same if I say it's the same! Oké? 
 Do you think she's Oké? 
 She's fine. 
 (Murmur of conversation) 
 Sorry. Sam. Sam, can I have a word? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 What is it? 
 Brigadier Stone was attacked. 
 Is he all right? 
 Well, he's in hospital. 
 But on the same day, Julien Baptiste came by and told me that... 
 Well, he told me that he thought that Stone was involved in Alice's abduction. 
 Why would he say that? 
 Matthew was there. He heard the whole thing, and then he went storming off to go and see those Adler boys. 
 What, you think..? 
 (What are you saying?) 
 You know the reputation those Adler twins have got. 
 There are rumours that they put Nadia Herz in hospital. 
 You think Matthew assaulted him? 
 You think he could do something like that? 
 You know what he's like these days. You saw his hands. 
 And the way he went off, honestly, Sam, it does, it makes sense. 
 (Music plays loudly) 
 Matthew! 
 Matthew! 
 (Music gets quieter) 
 What? 
 Can you come downstairs, please? 
 Now. 
 (Footsteps descend stairs) 
 Sit down. 
 I'm fine here. 
 Sit down. 
 What's happened to you, Matthew? 
 What's happened to ME? Take a look at you both. 
 Those men you're hanging around with, the Adler twins... 
 They're my friends. And anyway, I'm an adult, I can... 
 You're an adult who lives in our house. And you're our son. 
 We're trying to help you and if you can't see that... 
 All you're trying to do is find problems somewhere else... Stop it! 
 Christ. 
 Now what happened to your hand? 
 I cut it. Broke a pint glass. 
 Is that how you got the bruising on there? 
 You overheard Baptiste telling me that he thought Stone was involved in Alice's disappearance. And then you stormed out, and you went to the only place that you ever go to. 
 To see those Adler boys. 
 So? So Brigadier Stone is in hospital now. 
 What, and you think I had something to do with it? Well, did you? 
 This is it, isn't it? 
 This is who I am to you. 
 I'm just the monster that locked his sister in the shed to you, aren't I? 
 The one that goes around putting old men in hospital... 
 Matthew... And what if what you said was right? Huh? 
 What if he did have something to do with Alice being taken? 
 And you're all sitting around doing nothing. What then? 
 I'm a hero, aren't I? 
 So you admit it? You've been following orders all your life - from the headmaster, from your superiors, walking the line, ticking the boxes, and where has that got you? 
 That's enough... You're miserable. 
 You're lying to each other. 
 You know he's screwing someone else, right? 
 So before you go round asking what's happened to me, why don't you take a look at yourselves? 
 (Door slams) 
 (Door opens) 
 Mr Baptiste. 
 Mr Baptiste! 
 You're free to leave. 
 You've kept me for... what? 
 So you might find evidence that does not exist? 
 Before you leave, there is somebody to see you. 
 If it's all the same to you... 
 Eve Stone called you. 
 Mm-hm. 
 She's worried about you. 
 IN FRENCH: Don't. 
 If there is something you can solve, there is no use in worrying. 
 And if there is something you cannot fix, there is still no use in worrying. 
 It won't help you. 
 How could you do this to us? 
 How could you walk away from that operation? 
 I wasn't walking away from anything. 
 I was walking towards something else. 
 Towards some kind of resolution for two little girls whose lives were stolen from them. 
 I was walking towards something... I thought was bigger than myself. 
 You're a brilliant, loving man, and an amazing detective and you've achieved incredible things. 
 But right now? 
 You're a child, Julien. 
 A selfish child. 
 You'll storm into a building armed with a loaded gun, risking your life to make an arrest, but you won't take the same risk for the people who love you. 
 This... job. 
 This obsession. 
 This addiction. 
 You're no better than, than... Tony Hughes. 
 Getting lost in all the darkness that surrounds you. 
 Thinking you can fix everything and find the light switch. 
 It has to end. 
 You have to come home. 
 I am so close. 
 You're always so close. 
 But right now? 
 You're dying. 
 You're lost, my love, and the tide is coming in. 
 Wait. Wait, come on. He's our son. 
 This isn't right... 
 You think I want to do this? 
 I've lost you. I've lost my daughter... 
 If I do this then I lose my son as well. 
 And if we do nothing, isn't he lost anyway? 
 If there's a chance this will save him... 
 By locking him up? 
 (Sirens) 
 Do you know what I think? 
 Sometimes - and it's awful... 
 ..but we were happier before she came back. 
 You know, we were grieving... but we had her in common. 
 The three of us. 
 We have to save Matthew from himself. 
 Before he does something even worse. 
 Mr and Mrs Webster, I must talk with you. 
 Get out of my way. 
 Listen, I have found something. 
 This is on you, this is. 
 Coming here, filling our family's heads with crap, telling us Alice is still alive. 
 Matthew has done what he's done because he overheard you with your stupid accusations. He's trying to help you! 
 Well, he hasn't. Cos ever since he turned up, bad things are happening. 
 Listen, there's nothing more in the world that I want than for my husband to come home. 
 He's walked away from an operation that could help save his life to come out here and find out what happened to your girl. 
 He's walked away from me, from his daughter. 
 And I'm telling you, there is no way he would have done all that unless he thought it was worth it. 
 I have no problem with you. 
 But this - this is about my life and my family. 
 Listen, I have never lost hope that we might learn the truth about your daughter and Sophie Giroux. 
 And now I have finally found the truth. 
 The man who abducted Sophie and Alice works right here in Eckhausen. 
 His name is Adam Gettrick. 
 Gettrick? 
 You're serious? I spoke with him, before I was arrested. 
 I saw it. 
 In his eyes. 
 You saw it in his eyes?! 
 Jesus. Do you believe this? 
 (He sighs) 
 (Quietly) : What are we going to do about Matthew? 
 He's what matters now. What if he's right? 
 My daughter died. 
 How many times do you want me to bury her? 
 I won't do this. 
 I can't do this. 
 So what do we do now? 
 Gettrick knows I suspect him. 
 We will have to move quickly. 
 Did you tell the police? 
 They don't believe me. 
 Jorn Lenhart would be an ally, but he is not answering. 
 As I see it, there is one option still open to us. 
 Gettrick's house. 
 No. If he's as dangerous as you say he is... 
 If I am right, he knows I have seen him for who he is and he'll already be gone. 
 IN FRENCH: Listen, that thing in your head? 
 You can't run away from it, Julien. 
 I know. 
 Oké. 
 IN FRENCH: 
 (Car approaches) 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 Are you sure you wish to do this? 
 Well, I'm here, aren't I? 
 Lucy. Lucy, wake up, darling. 
 There you go. 
 We'll find you something here, won't we? 
 Something to replace Mr Squibbles. 
 What's wrong? 
 It's just I've... I must've left some cash at home. But it's fine. 
 It's fine. It doesn't matter. 
 Look at him. He's nice, isn't he? 
 (Door opens, bell tinkles) 
 Mummy! Lucy! 
 I've missed you. 
 It's amazing. Us all here together. 
 It was worth it, wasn't it? 
 Every second. 
 Come on. You need to help me with everything in the car. 
 (Taps foot on tiles) 
 What is it? 
 Look at that. 
 Will you help me move these boxes, Mrs Webster? 
 Right. 
 That's the last of it. 
 Feels good, doesn't it? 
 The air here... Shh. 
 She must be tired from the long journey. 
 What's in the bag? 
 She'll love it. 
 No, it's not for her. 
 She used to talk about one of these. Remember? 
 The one her brother used to keep trying to steal from her. 
 (Keys jangle) 
 Back in the day. 
 Back when she behaved. 
 She was very good in the car, though. 
 I didn't hear a sound from the boot the entire journey. 
 So I thought I'd give her a present... for being such a good girl. 
 You can have this... if you're good. 
 Stay. 
 You will be good, won't you, Alice? 
 I'll be good.
