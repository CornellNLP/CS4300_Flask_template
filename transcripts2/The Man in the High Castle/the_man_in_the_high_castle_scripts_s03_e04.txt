  Stand up and let me see you. 
  (PEOPLE MURMURING)

  Hmm. 
  You know, I intend to see him today. 
  I'll be careful.

  - Mm. 
  So what's your schedule for today? 
  (HORNS HONKING) 
  Nothing. 
  Uh Bridget does the shopping, the the housework. 
  I have nothing to do. 
  Why don't you get out the house, go for a walk? 
  It would do you some good. 
  You know, I I really think that I want to go back to see Dr. 
  Ryan. 
  (SMITH SIGHS) 
  John I need it. 
  I don't know, Helen. 
  I promise I would only talk about Thomas.

  You following me? 
  (WOMAN SINGING IN JAPANESE OVER RADIO) 
  You knew I was following you. 
  You're hard to miss. 
  Tell me something. 
  Whatever happened to that film I gave you? 
  I delivered it to Smith. 
  Whatever happened to Frank? 
  I don't know. 
  He disappeared. 
  So you're still in touch with the Resistance? 
  No. 
  I left that behind. 
  You still looking for the Man in the High Castle? 
  No. 
  No, that was Smith's obsession, not mine. 
  Speaking of Smith, you said he manipulated you. 
  I'm curious. 
  What kind of deal did you have to make? 
  I gave him my father. 
  (BIRDS SINGING, CROW CAWING) 
  Oh, hey, hey. 
  Hi, Dad. 
  (LAUGHING): Well, I missed you, too. 
  - Hey, Pop. 
  - Lunch is ready. 
  I'm starving. 
  Let's go. 
  - You coming, Pop? 
  - In a minute, Charlie. 
  That was a hell of a thing this morning. 
  - Oh, you don't think he was coming for me, do you? 
  - No. 
  He's just some cheap bounty hunter. 
  I've seen enough killing for one lifetime. 
  Yeah, I wish there were another way. 
  Well, there is. 
  This, what you're doing here. 
  This. 
  There's something I want to show you. 
  (FRANK SIGHS) 
  I've been working on this. 
  Huh? 
  Well, who's that supposed to be? 
  The Kempeitai? 
  No, the fascists in general. 
  The secret police everywhere. 
  The the internalized oppression of subjugated people all over the world. 
  Yeah, well, it looks like Kido to me. 
  Ah, any resemblance is strictly coincidental. 
  (SAMPSON LAUGHS) 
  Well? 
  Well, it scares me shitless. 
  Good. 
  Good, it should. 
  Now, the sunrise it represents hope, the promise and possibility of a new day, a new dawn. 
  But this, this man this is the necessary next step, a reminder of the forces of darkness arrayed to prevent that new dawn. 
  What? 
  You think people don't already know? 
  No, I think they've forgotten, or, you know, they never knew. 
  They think this world is normal, and it's not. 
  You said my, uh my sunrise was all over the Pacific States. 
  Yeah, and the Neutral Zone. 
  Ah, great. 
  All right, look, I made posters. 
  Take them back with you. 
  I want you to put them up. 
  Yeah, there's there's something you should know. 
  Um people are are not only putting up your art. 
  They're copying it. 
  Young people, especially. 
  They're they're making it their own. 
  FRANK: Ah, this is fantastic. 
  - Yeah. 
  - All the more reason why we Look, they're arresting people, Frank. 
  - I don't want anyone to get hurt. 
  - Well, look, in a way, it's out of your hands. 
  Th these sunrises, they d they don't even belong to you anymore. 
  But this, this is really gonna get the Pons' attention. 
  - And not in a good way. 
  - You said people need to see - all this. 
  - Yeah, and and, one day, the time will be right. 
  And when it is, I promise you that we will wallpaper these sons of bitches like nobody's business. 
  SMITH: Cause of death? 
  BERG: Blunt force trauma. 
  Was he compromised? 
  Some animal activity. 
  But no signs of torture. 
  Thank you, Doctor. 
  What exactly did he say about us? 
  Uh, that St. 
  Theresa's hides Jews. 
  And that rumor has it there's a whole nest of us up here in the mountains somewhere. 
  Ugh. 
  Well, that worries me. 
  I think most folks think that Sabra is a folk legend. 
  Like Sh Shangri-La, you know? 
  - Sabra, the Lost Colony of Semites. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Not too far from the truth then, huh? 
  Well, let's hope no one misses this b*st*rd and comes here looking for him. 
  There. 
  I'm gonna head into town. 
  Pick up some supplies, see if there's any chatter. 
  What will you do without me, you up here all alone? 
  Well, I will study my Torah and try not to make a fool out of myself - at the bar mitzvah. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  We'll be calling you Rabbi yet. 
  Reb Sampson, thank you. 
  I like it. 
  (INSECTS TRILLING) 
  Marks, not yen. 
  How much? 
  Twenty-five. 
  25,000 marks? 
  Well, it's a big f*cking ask. 
  The trade minister? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Well, my price just went up. 
  Fifty. 
  Take it or leave it. 
  (EXHALES) 
  Your contact? 
  Solid gold. 
  Got a man inside. 
  Inside the Kempeitai? 
  How'd you manage that? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  All right. 
  I need associates, addresses, business connections everything the Kempeitai has on him. 
  What makes you think they got anything on him? 
  Well, because Chief Inspector Kido keeps an eye on him. 
  They have a thick file. 
  Believe me. 
  - Domo. 
  Konichiwa. 
  - Konichiwa. 
  Suimasen. 
  Trade Minister, Tagomi-san. 
  What a wonderful view.

  Ah. 
  I hope I'm not being too forward, but I was wondering if you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. 
  Uh, yes, yes. 
  Of of course. 
  Ah. 
  Wonderful. 
  I'll cook you some Okinawan food. 
  My mother's recipes. 
  - That would be wonderful.

  ED: But John Wayne was married. 
  So was I, sugar. 
  So was I. 
  The Duke gave me this just before he left to fight with the Rebels. 
  And this is the belt buckle he wore in Stagecoach? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Stagecoach is my favorite Ford. 
  Yeah, I just Feels a wee bit apocryphal. 
  That means he doesn't believe you. 
  O ye of little faith. 
  He told me to keep it as a memento till he came back, which, of course, he never did. 
  Oh. 
  Now, that's a horse of a different color. 
  That's me, that's the Duke, and there's the buckle. 
  CHILDAN: Yeah. 
  Yeah, I can see that. 
  He was killed in action at the Battle of Dayton. 
  Oh. 
  You know that? 
  Everyone knows that. 
  I mean, John Wayne. 
  Wu? 
  We'll give you five marks for this and the photo. 
  That's the only picture I have of the Duke and me. 
  Well, buckle's not worth a pfennig without the photo. 
  Well, could you see your way clear to seven? 
  I I got my rent to make, and and seven marks might get me through. 
  - I'll tell you what I'll do - ED: 15. 
  We'll pay her 15. 
  Fifteen. 
  That's fair. 
  Right? 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  Happy? 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  What makes you so sure this man is still alive? 
  He's alive. 
  Zone's a big place. 
  Locate him, and I will persuade the trade minister to reverse the empire's policy on black market oil. 
  (SPEAKS JAPANESE) 
  Permission to buy and sell? 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  You are already trafficking in stolen petroleum, doing brisk business. 
  But we will open the tap turn a blind eye if you can get me what I want.

  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  (BAND PLAYING JAZZ) 
  Kido-san. 
  Is everything okay? 
  No. 
  Would you like a little privacy? 
  Who is he? 
  Who is who? 
  The kokujin you were talking to. 
  The bass player. 
  He just likes to chat me up between sets that's all. 
  You were very familiar with him. 
  Kido-san are you jealous? 
  You are jealous. 
  - (GRUNTING) 
  - (CLACKING) 
  THELMA: So this is part of the new project? 
  Year Zero? 
  That's right. 
  Propaganda's an essential component. 
  We're correcting American history here. 
  Setting the record straight. 
  Glad to see you've put the best and brightest on it. 
  NICOLE: Cut. 
  - Cut! 
  - Okay, cut. 
  This is the old America. 
  You are the new America. 
  I want to see you full of power, energy. 
  In fact, get the camera off the sticks and move it in closer. 
  Follow them. 
  We need to feel the kinetic potential, the vitality of the new American Nazi youth. 
  Okay, boys, what you're doing here is important work. 
  You're erasing the past, replacing it with a better world, a world that is entirely yours. 
  We ready? 
  - Okay, back to the start, please. 
  - Ready. 
  And action! 
  - (GRUNTING) 
  - Now get down low, underneath them, as they work. 
  Shoot up. 
  Make him look heroic. 
  JACK: You have enough gas to get home? 
  Yeah. 
  I bought some off this mafioso guy last night. 
  Cost a fortune. 
  You can't do, say, uh, one more night? 
  I wish. 
  I got this, you know (CHUCKLES) 
  Ball and chain? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Well, I wouldn't put it that way, but, yeah, he's been on my back. 
  And he's my ride. 
  Well, take the bus. 
  I'll pay for the ticket. 
  I don't know. 
  Are you scared? 
  Maybe. 
  Maybe I'm scared I'll never go back. 
  Well, would that be such a bad thing? 
  I got my grandpa, Jack. 
  He's old. 
  He probably thinks I'm dead. 
  Furthest thing from the truth. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Well, look who found a little courage. 
  You did that. 
  I don't know. 
  I mean, to me, it seems like you're just becoming more yourself. 
  I, uh (CLEARS THROAT)

  (INDISTINCT SHOUTING, SCREAMING, FIRE CRACKLING) 
  That was horrific. 
  (EXHALES) 
  Hey. 
  There was nothing that we could have done. 
  Who would do something like that to themselves? 
  Look, people are capable of anything. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Especially when they're desperate. 
  Are they? 
  You know they are. 
  JULIANA: I need a drink.

  I, um I'm sorry. 
  There's no ice. 
  - (CLEARS THROAT) 
  - Cheers. 
  What's all this? 
  Uh, there's a place called, um, Lackawanna, in Pennsylvania. 
  Ring a bell? 
  Mmm. 
  Should it? 
  It's somewhere in the Poconos. 
  You planning on taking a vacation to the Reich? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Of course not. 
  Then what's with the map? 
  Just got interested. 
  Do you believe in past lives? 
  Other lives? 
  Reichsfuhrer Himmler does. 
  So maybe there's something to it. 
  Hey. 
  Me, uh, no. 
  Not so much. 
  Listen I have a memory of a place, this place. 
  And I'm sure I've been there, but I haven't. 
  Not in this life. 
  JOE: It's dÃ©Â  vu. 
  Everybody has those moments. 
  I'm sure I've been there with you. 
  I wish. 
  I'm sure I've been here with you, too. 
  Many, many times. 
  Me, too. 
  I've imagined this moment many times. 
  TAGOMI: Howard Wexler. 
  Who is he? 
  A defector from the Reich. 
  Like Diels. 
  Only much more valuable. 
  A researcher. 
  I believe it was the same assassin in both cases. 
  Wexler was working with your ministry. 
  On a project I cannot discuss. 
  The Nazis are doing their best to sabotage us. 
  And they are succeeding. 
  These street protests The street protests are under control. 
  The agitators are suffering for oil. 
  Kerosene. 
  Gasoline. 
  Heating oil. 
  What are you doing about it, Trade Minister? 
  Again, nothing I will discuss with you, Chief Inspector. 
  (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION IN DISTANCE) 
  Hey. 
  Did you sleep? 
  JULIANA: I had this dream I've had it before. 
  Something's happened. 
  And the world's turned to ash, and then I'm in this tunnel. 
  With you. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  What? 
  Well, I'm happy to be a part of your nightmare. 
  We got to get you out of this place, Juliana. 
  It's I'd have nightmares living in a place like this. 
  We could get away from here. 
  Go on a trip. 
  Visit what was it called? 
  Lackawanna. 
  Yeah, the Poconos. 
  Yeah, but like you said, it's in the Reich. 
  I have my connections. 
  Yeah, I know you do. 
  I got to go.

  You just need practice. 
  Come over any time. 
  In fact, if you really want to write a column - about my work - Year Zero. 
  then perhaps we should meet on a regular basis. 
  Well, I want to know all about it. 
  How much time do you have? 
  Wayne's off with a friend tonight. 
  Well, in that case Mmm. 
  (SINGING CONTINUES) 
  JOE: I have the plans, or the equations? 
  At least I think I do. 
  I'm sorry, sir, I flunked physics. 
  HIMMLER (ON TELEPHONE): You dealt a real blow to their efforts to copy our Nebenwelt project. 
  JOE: Thank you, sir. 
  You have a plan to deal with the trade minister? 
  I'm working on it, sir. 
  HIMMLER: It was through Tagomi's efforts that the traitor Wexler defected. 
  He knows too much. 
  I just need a little more time, sir. 
  HIMMLER: Well, you are on the ground. 
  That is for you to decide when and where to strike Tagomi. 
  But don't delay too long. 
  Yes, Mein Fuhrer. 
  This is what you were born for, Josef.

  Yeah, about that Ed, I'm not budging on our split. 
  We already talked about this. 
  I don't give a damn about your split. 
  I'm just saying, there's no reason why you and I need to be attached at the hip. 
  We're partners. 
  We made a deal. 
  - Yeah, but lifelong? 
  - No, of course not. 
  I'm not tied to you, you know. 
  I'm free, free to do whatever I want, go wherever I want.
