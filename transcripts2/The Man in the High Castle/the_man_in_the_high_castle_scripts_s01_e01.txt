 It's a new day. The sun rises in the east. Across our land, men and women go to work in factories and farms... Providing for their families. Everyone has a job. Everyone knows the part they play keeping our country strong and safe. So today, we give thanks to our brave leaders, knowing we are stronger and prouder, and better.

 Hey, uh, pal. 
 Yeah. 
 Do you know where the manager is? 
 [Indistinct under machinery sounds] 
 Are you the manager, Mr. Warren? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm Joe Blake. 
 So? 
 I was told you have a job. 
 And who told you that, Joe Blake? 
 I didn't get his name. 
 Just this. 
 So this is what they're sending me now. 
 How old are you, 28? 
 27. 
 27. 
 What the hell you doing here, Joe Blake? 
 I want my country back, sir. 
 You want it back? You never had it. 
 Sir? 
 You were still sucking your thumb when they dropped the bomb. 
 This sh1t hole's the only country you've ever known. 
 Well, my father told me what it was like, before the war. 
 Your father, huh? 
 He said every man was free. 
 How do I know you're not a spy? 
 A spy? 
 The resistance... what's left of it... is shot through with them. 
 Half my friends are dead. 
 Guess that's why they're down to kids like you. 
 I'm not a spy. 
 You know what those brownshirts out there would do if they caught you? 
 I'm not afraid to die. 
 Me, either. Might be a relief, actually. 
 But how you feel about pain? 
 Pain? 
 Yeah. 
 When they're plucking your fingernails out one by one, or they're cracking your balls open like walnuts. 
 That's when maybe you stop caring about what your old man said and tell Johnny Jackboot out there my name, or just about anything else he wants. 
 You're so afraid, why are you here? 
 I fought in the war, kid. 
 I saw my buddies' brains get blown out on Virginia Beach. 
 You... You're just a punk who could get me caught. 
 Yeah, I guess I'm afraid of pain. 
 I don't have any buddies who died in the war. 
 I don't really know what freedom is. 
 But I'm not a punk and I'm not a spy, Mr. Warren. 
 I'm here because I want to do the right thing. 
 So you gonna give me the job or not? 
 You take the autobahn across the Reich. 
 You stop here, Canon City. 
 That's the neutral zone. 
 Wow, he can read a map too, huh? 
 What am I gonna do there? 
 You wait. 
 Your contact will approach you when and if he determines it's safe. 
 And if he doesn't? 
 Nazis are onto you. You're dead. 
 What's this? 
 Benzedrine. 
 You get sleepy on the road, you pop a couple of those. 
 No stopping. 
 These why he calls you "doc"? 
 The boy's fast, huh? 
 You can talk to me, you know. I'm in the room. 
 You know how to use one of those? 
 What do I need that for? 
 Any luck, you don't. 
 You know how to use it or not? 
 Yeah. I've seen the movies. 
 Point and shoot. 
 So what's my cargo? 
 Good German coffeemakers. 
 That's not what I meant. 
 You heard what curiosity did to the cat? 
 Coffeemakers. Now, get going. 
 See you boys when I get back. 
 You'll never see us again. That's how it works. 
 Good luck, kid.

 Of course I can.

 Trudy, this is me. What's going on? 
 You always looked out for me, sis, but... 
 You don't need to anymore. 
 Oh, yeah? Why is that?

 Frank, is that me? 
 Well, if you can't tell, I'm in trouble.

 Yeah? 
 You're such a good artist, you should be out there, selling your art. 
 Yeah, well, they won the war, and they think modern art is degenerate. 
 Hey, how's class? 
 You'd have been really proud of me. 
 I'm always proud of you. 
 A nice change after seeing mom. 
 Mm-mm.

 Apparently, dad's spinning in his grave because I'm studying the evil ways of the yellow man. 
 Yeah, of course he is. 
 Aikido is the exact opposite of the men who killed my dad. 
 It's so beautiful. 
 Now you're back on your feet, maybe it's time to get a job. 
 I'm working on it. Then what? 
 Well, then we get married... you know, have kids.

 V.A. Day, 1952. 
 All right, I'm gonna head home.

 No, stay. 
 See you later. I'm taking this with me.

 Mr. Hitler, he's got his right hand in his pocket. 
 Do you know why? 
 So he can play with his balls, 'cause nobody else will? 
 He's got Parkinson's. His hands shake like sh1t. 
 How much longer do you think he's got? 
 I don't know, a year? 
 Six months, tops. 
 Then Goebbels or Himmler takes over, only this time, they won't just flatten D.C. with the H-bomb.

 Some guy Ed told me about it. 
 He makes these anti-fascist movies. 
 Makes them... G.I.'s in Times Square? 
 No, I know they look real. 
 Yeah, they look real 'cause they are real. 
 But they can't be, can they? 
 [Film clicking] 
 Whatever they are, Hitler ordered them all destroyed. 
 Why, if they're just stupid movies? 
 The point is, possessing them is treason. 
 How did you get this? 
 Trudy gave it to me. 
 Trudy? 
 What the hell is she doing with this? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know. 
 She's dead. 
 What? 
 They shot her on the street. 
 Hey. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. [Sobs] 
 Hey, we have to go to the police. 
 Police are the ones who shot her, Frank. 
 You have to say you weren't close. 
 She was only your half-sister. 
 No, Frank, no. 
 You didn't know what she gave you. 
 You're a loyal subject and will cooperate Trudy died for this, Frank. fully. 
 They have to think you know nothing about this, or they'll kill you too. 
 You think Trudy would want that?

 No, you're not coming with me. 
 Of course I am. 
 Frank, the last thing you need is trouble with the police. 
 Jules, this is serious. 
 I know it is, which is why the less involved you are, the better. 
 I still think I should go! 
 Not a chance.

 Doni. 
 You said tea this morning. 
 Yes, of course. 
 Um... 
 I'm sorry, I forgot I have an appointment. 
 Can we do this another time? 
 Yes, okay. 
 Thank you. 
 After the crown prince gives his speech here, I personally will escort him and the princess inside this room where we will take tea. 
 Is there a problem, Mr. Tagomi? 
 I'm sorry, the furniture in this room is inappropriate for the crown prince and princess. 
 Trade Minister, I assure you these are very fine pieces, the same as the fuhrer has in Berlin. 
 We're happy to replace it, of course, if you'll send us information on the proper pieces. 
 Yes, thank you. 
 Thank you, Ambassador. 
 We're deeply honored to receive the crown prince and princess as guests here at the embassy. 
 It is an harmonious expression of the friendship between the German and Japanese peoples. 
 What the hell was that about? 
 The furniture doesn't have chi. 
 Chi? 
 One of the five great elements. 
 It comes from the Chinese. They believe there's a spirit in things, bringing good or bad luck. 
 [Laughs] Superstitious slant-eyed crap. 
 I don't understand why the fuhrer allowed these people to rule half the continent. 
 "Allowed." But for how much longer? 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 The Nazi officer has a disdain. 
 He only understands a world he can see. 
 You seem troubled, Trade Minister. 
 It's a time of great uncertainty, Kotomichi. 
 The fuhrer is said to be very ill. 
 Surely his successor will continue a policy of peaceful cohabitation. 
 I consulted the oracle.

 Where the truck was sent. 
 Mm. 
 I'm listening. 
 Alabama. 
 Alabama? 
 Birmingham. 
 And the cargo? 
 Coffeemakers. 
 So your men shoot at us to keep us from intercepting coffeemakers? 
 They were stolen. He didn't want to go to jail. 
 You're the leader of the resistance for east New York, Mr. Warren. 
 We've known it for a month now, ever since we intercepted one of these. 
 This is the symbol of your movement, is it not? 
 We know where that truck was headed. 
 And what it was carrying. 
 If you know so much, what do you want with me, huh? 
 What do you want? 
 What do you want... Huh? What do you want! 
 Uhh... uhh... aah!

 All right, that should be good. 
 Pull slowly up. 
 All right, hold. 
 That should do it. 
 Oh, thanks a lot. 
 There's not another diner open for about five hours. 
 Wife packed an extra sandwich if you're hungry. 
 Oh, you don't mind? 
 No, not at all. 
 I will need to see your transit papers. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Uh, egg salad. I hope that's okay. 
 That's great. 
 There we go. 
 Oh, it's your first long haul? 
 How'd you know? 
 Well, not having a tool kit. That's a... rookie mistake. 
 I guess so. It's my first time out of New York, actually, first time seeing the country. 
 Well, here it is. 
 You mind I ask, the tattoo on your arm? 
 Oh. 
 A soldier so fierce, he'd kill a rose. 
 That was you? 
 Oh, a long time ago. 
 We lost the war, didn't we? 
 Now, I can't even remember what we were fighting for. 
 [Chuckles] Uh, your dad a vet? 
 Yeah. 
 Must be proud, fine young man like you. 
 We're not really close, but me getting this job is pretty important to him.

 Yes, I suppose so. Who are you? 
 I'm her sister.

 No, I'm going in her place. 
 They're expecting Trudy, not you. 
 I'll say I'm her. 
 It's too dangerous. 
 So what, she dies for nothing? 
 Not nothing. 
 She died doing the right thing. 
 The right thing? 
 You got to be f*cking kidding. 
 What do I do when I get there? 
 Tell me. 
 Uh, you wait. 
 I wait? 
 They will come to you if it is safe. 
 This film, what does it mean? 
 You want to help? Don't ask questions. 
 [Sonic boom, jet engines roar] 
 [Bus engine rumbles] 
 Ah, Mr. Baynes, Nobusuke Tagomi. 
 Mr. Tagomi, very kind of you to meet me in person. 
 Trade relations with Sweden is very important to the pacific states. 
 My associate, Mr. Kotomichi, will see to your baggage. 
 Thank you. 
 And how was your flight? 
 New York to San Francisco in under two hours. 
 [Chuckles] German technology. 
 We Japanese cannot hope to compete. 
 Technology is not the measure of a great civilization. 
 Forgive me, captain, I must confirm your identity. 
 Of course. 
 I'm told Sweden is a lovely country, but I never visited. 
 I don't know the first thing about exports, I'm afraid. 
 Thank you. 
 You seem burdened, Mr. Tagomi. 
 [Sighs] I have consulted the I ching. 
 Those sticks you throw. 
 Oracle favors our meeting. 
 Good to hear, since both our governments would execute us if they knew we were talking. 
 The man you are to meet will arrive from Tokyo in two days' time. 
 He's traveling with the crown prince and princess? 
 And what news do you bring from Berlin? 
 The fuhrer's health is poor, and Goebbels and Himmler, they're jockeying for power. 
 Neither seeks peace. 
 They deny it in public, but both men think the partition of the Americas was a mistake. 
 They've dropped the bomb before, and they won't hesitate to drop it again. 
 Then there will be war. 
 Once the fuhrer dies... 
 Without question. 
 And this city would be one of the first ones to be erased from the map. 
 What are you so gloomy about, Mr. Tagomi? 
 You said the oracle favors our meeting. 
 Fate is fluid, Captain Wegener. 
 Destiny is in the hands of men. 
 You know our only hope, don't you? 
 Yeah, we've got no hope. 
 You're wrong. It's Rommel. 
 Rommel? 
 Yeah. 
 All these little rats... Goebbels and Himmler and goring... all scurrying around, waiting for the old man to die. 
 The desert fox swoops in, wipes 'em all out. 
 Rommel's retired. 
 Yeah, but he's still in his early 70s. 
 He's a hell of a lot more vigorous than Mr. mustache, don't you think? 
 Yeah, I suppose. 
 Cover for me, will you? 
 Okay, sure. 
 Mr. Matson? 
 Yeah, Frank? 
 Uh, I'm... I'm just wondering, have you had a chance to look at the designs? 
 You just gave them to me this morning, Frank. 
 Right, and? 
 And as it happens, I have looked at them. 
 They're quite beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 But look, they're degenerate, Frank. 
 You just said they're beautiful. 
 How can jewelry be degenerate? 
 Japs only want the old-timey stuff, like the colt .45s, Americana. 
 No one has actually tried selling them jewelry. 
 And no one's going to. 
 Come on, Frank, come back from fairy land. 
 You're a solid worker. You've got a solid job. 
 Count your blessings. 
 May I? 
 Sure. 
 Guy next to me was just snoring. 
 I can never sleep on buses, can you? 
 What brings you to the neutral zone? 
 Oh, just visiting a friend. 
 You must have some interesting friends. 
 I don't know what you mean. 
 You see any other white girls on this bus? 
 I mean, take a look around, darlin'. 
 Wrong color, wrong religion, wrong bedmate. 
 The Nazis catch 'em, and poof! Up in smoke they go. 
 But the japs are happy to let 'em scramble out of the pacific states. 
 They can hole up in the rocky mountains, or run down to South America if they like. 
 What's it like, the neutral zone? 
 [Chuckles] 
 You ever seen them westerns that the fuhrer watches? 
 It's like that, lawless. 
 Except for the marshal, of course. 
 The marshal? 
 This is your first time, isn't it? 
 He's a Nazi agent, and he hunts down enemies of the Reich. 
 He strings 'em up and he burns 'em alive. 
 Katie Owens. 
 Oh. Trudy... Walker.

 Jules? 
 Jules?

 Hey! [Banging on window] 
 Hey, she has my bag. She has my things. 
 Wait! Stop. Can you wait? Wait. 
 Please... 
 Please wait, sir. I left something out there. 
 The bus is leaving. 
 No. 
 Where is this man's minder? 
 I'll find him, Obergruppenfuhrer. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Footsteps approach] 
 Heil Hitler. 
 Why was this man left unattended? 
 The... 
 Subject is unconsciousness, Obergruppenfuhrer. 
 Yes, I can see that. 
 Your orders were to flog this man until he answered your questions. 
 Obergruppenfuhrer, the subject cannot wake up. 
 Has he answered your questions? 
 No, Obergruppenfuhrer. 
 Then your orders are keep flogging him. 
 You torture men. 
 You have a problem with beating a man to death? 
 No, Obergruppenfuhrer. 
 Good. 
 Then do as you're told. 
 You're smiling, Erich. 
 You already know the answers to any of questions that he would ask this man. 
 Of course. 
 So the subject will die in captivity. 
 Indeed. 
 His friends in the resistance will see his disfigured body, and they will conclude that he was only so badly beaten because he refused to talk. 
 They will conclude that we don't know that truck is headed to Canon City, or what it is carrying. 
 I have much to learn from you, Obergruppenfuhrer.

 I'm so sorry, I can't pay you. 
 You what? 
 Someone stole my wallet, all my money. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 This ain't no charity, lady. 
 I know. I'm really embarrassed. 
 How you gonna pay me? 
 I told you, I can't. 
 Wrong answer. How are you going to pay me? 
 I... 
 You know what we do to folks around here who don't pay their bills? 
 I'll pay for it. 
 No, I don't need your money, whoever you are. 
 I... 
 Oh, yes, you do. 
 That's 2 marks, please. 
 There you go. 
 I didn't ask you to do that. 
 I know you didn't. 
 You're welcome, by the way. 
 Hey, where you going? 
 No place. 
 Can I buy you a drink? 
 After you. 
 I guess I should thank you for what you did back there. 
 It's no problem. 
 You always so helpful to strangers? 
 Pretty ones, I am. 
 I can't pay you back. 
 Yeah, I didn't think you could. 
 No... no! 
 So what's your name? 
 I'm Trudy. 
 Trudy, pleased to meet you. I'm Joe. 
 Oh! [Coughs] 
 So how long you been in Canon City, Trudy? 
 Just got here, as a matter of fact. 
 How about you? 
 I'm just passing through. That's my truck over there. 
 You weren't looking for anyone named Trudy, were you? 
 No. 
 So this is... you really just wanted to talk? 
 Yeah, why? Is that so weird? 
 Nope. Guess not. 
 Aw. Crud. 
 What? 
 I'll be right back. 
 [Line ringing] 
 Hey, it's me. 
 How was your journey? 
 No one stopped me. 
 Then your cover's intact. 
 I'll tell your father, Joe. I know he'll be very proud. 
 Thank you, Obergruppenfuhrer. I hope so. 
 Heil Hitler. 
 Heil Hitler.
