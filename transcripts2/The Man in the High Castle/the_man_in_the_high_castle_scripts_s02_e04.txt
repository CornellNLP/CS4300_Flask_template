 [Panting] 
 Well? 
 Lem's got the whole bunch safely out of Frisco now. 
 We're fine. 
 What about the kempeitai? 
 Quiet. 
 Not for long. 
 Where's Frank? 
 Want a beer? 
 Sure. 
 You okay? 
 What did you leave me with her for? 
 She's okay, Frank. You can trust her. 
 How long have you been fighting? 
 The Resistance since '57. 
 The fighting, I've been doing that forever. 
 Taking a life to save innocent lives is nothing to feel bad about, Frank. 
 Yeah, I know that. 
 Do you? 
 I didn't think I could actually kill a man. 
 I can't say that feels good, even if he was a pawn. 
 Someone once told me it takes a lot of effort not to be free. 
 I kept my head down for so long, I forgot what it feels like to stand up. 
 So yeah. 
 I feel better than I have in a long, long time. 
 Good. 
 There you are, girls. 
 Just like the women used to wear in Hawaii. 
 Behind your left ear means you're married, and behind your right ear means you're single. 
 No one's ever going to marry Amy. 
 Mom. 
 You look so pretty. 
 Okay, now go play, both of you. 
 An no more teasing, Jennifer Smith, or there's no dessert. 
 Thomas : Max. 
 Thomas, take Max out back to play, will you, please? 
 Max, come here, boy. 
 [Barking] 
 Alice, what's wrong? 
 Helen... 
 Gerry's gone. 
 Gone? 
 They found him in his car. 
 His heart just gave out. 
 [Jet Flying Overhead] 
 Heil Hitler. 
 Josef. 
 I was told I need your authorization to leave Berlin. 
 That intelligence officer said something to upset you last night? 
 It doesn't matter. Look, I just want to go home. 
 The Fatherland is home, Josef, and Berlin the beating heart of an empire that will live for a thousand years. 
 I've waited my entire life just wondering what you would say to me when we first met. 
 I never thought you'd make a speech. 
 You know, it's clear to me you don't understand, Josef. 
 Do you understand why we spilled so much blood in the war? Hmm? 
 Why we... worked so hard to build our industry and... and our agriculture? 
 Taking care of our families and teaching our children? 
 It's because the Führer has always believed we can do better, that we can be better. 
 There is no God in heaven. 
 That means it's up to us to turn this life into heaven on Earth. 
 If you wanted me to be a part of all this... maybe you shouldn't have sent us away. 
 Sent you away? 
 I didn't leave your mother. She left me. 
 That's a lie. 
 I wish it were. 
 Then why didn't you come try to find us? 
 I tried, but she burnt all my letters, and she wouldn't take my calls. 
 Elsa was so angry that she was determined to turn you against me, and she did. 
 It was all her fault, and you did nothing wrong! 
 Of course I did! 
 But there were things here in Berlin she couldn't accept. 
 I never meant to lose you. 
 I swear it. 
 I can't take back the past, but the future... that is up to us. 
 Please stay. 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 It's too late for that. 
 Road blocks have been set up at all the major arteries out of the city. 
 And the civilians in the transport vehicle, where were they collected? 
 The Mission District. 
 Send six foot soldiers down there now. 
 Kakka. 
 Do not question me. 
 These criminals are begging us to escalate, an we shall oblige them. 
 Hai, kakka. 
 Trade minister, enter. 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 You wanted to see me? 
 You had these photographs sent to me... the effect of the atomic bomb the Nazis dropped in Washington. 
 It seems relevant, Onoda-kakka, given the project we have embarked upon. 
 You take pity on the Americans, Tagomi-tasho, but where is your pity for us? 
 The Führer surely would have destroyed us if he could have. 
 Respectfully, General, the Japanese do not need pity. 
 I am but a trade minister. 
 It's not my job to disagree. 
 It certainly is not. 
 Take these with you so you won't forget. 
 Trade Minister. 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 Listen to this. 
 "Reinhart Heydrich has retired to his estate outside Prague." 
 And I am listening because? 
 Because Heydrich's one of the most powerful men in the Reich, and he's only 58. 
 You got to read between the lines. 
 He was purged. 
 Probably rotting away in a cell somewhere for trying to overthrow the old man. 
 Don't you think? 
 No because at the moment I don't care a whit about any of it. 
 Oh, you should. Once Hitler's out of the way, the Nazis are going to level this place with an A bomb, just like D.C. 
 [Sigh] 
 What? 
 I'm curious. 
 How would you assess the value of your life, Mr. McCarthy? 
 The value of my life? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Mr. Frink laid waste to his life... and, more importantly, to mine... for an individual of questionable intelligence and vulgar taste whose primary occupations appear to be reading the newspapers and picking his teeth. 
 Would you say that was worth it? 
 That question's rhetorical. 
 [Door Opens] 
 Where have you been? 
 [Door Closes] 
 Ed, come on. 
 We now have only six days to deliver the 60,000 yen the Yakuza demanded, and thus far you and your verbose little friend here have done exactly nothing. 
 We'll be back with the materials. 
 Have some food ready. 
 [Scoff] I'm not your cook. 
 [Door Closes] 
 Sir, to update you, our spies in the Pacific States have accessed a top-secret report. 
 The Resistance car was recovered from the Karen Vecchione shooing. 
 The kempeitai believe it came from the High Castle hideout. 
 And soil samples from tire treads were analyzed. 
 The analysis found a concentration of a particular phosphate fertilizer and chemical and mineral compounds that indicates they may be hiding... 
 [Voice Becomes Distorted] 
 We'll update you as further reports are intercepted. 
 Sturmbannführer, would you stay, please? 
 Erich, there's something I'd like you to look into for me. 
 Two? 
 Hi, Mark. 
 Hey, Frank. How are you? 
 This is my friend Ed. 
 Hey, Ed. Good to meet you. 
 Hi. 
 Can we talk? 
 Yeah, sure. Come on, sit down. 
 No, uh, alone. 
 Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
 Listen, I'll be right back, okay? 
 So, Frank, I was... 
 I was really pleased to get your message. 
 I kept thinking about what you said. 
 Beauty's important. 
 An artist should make art. 
 Well, you're welcome to all the copper and metal alloy that you want, but I'm going to need some money to score some gold. 
 We're broke, Mark, and we can't finish the piece without the gold. Can you advance it? 
 We can pay you back in a week. 
 Uh, you're that sure you're going to sell your art? 
 We already got a buyer lined up. 
 Don't we, Ed? 
 Yeah. 
 Well... all right. 
 I'll do it. 
 For Laura, all right? 
 Ed, good to meet you. I'm going to go get it. 
 Frank, that guy's got kids. 
 So? 
 So don't get him mixed up in this. 
 We can't pay him back. 
 All the money's got to go to the Yakuza. 
 You got a better idea? 
 Exactly. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Shouting In Japanese] 
 Come on. Don't look, don't look. 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 Mark : It's reprisals. 
 For what? 
 It's like Boston after the war. 
 We take out one of their guys, and the Nazis would kill ten of us. 
 [Shouting In Japanese] 
 Go! 
 Dear God. 
 I got to get my kids out of here. Go, go, go, go, go. 
 Frank? 
 [Shouting In Japanese] 
 They want us to see this. 
 What are we going to do? 
 [Shouting] 
 Where is he? 
 What's the matter? 
 Hey, Gary. 
 What? 
 Uh, they're... they're shooting people by the market. 
 Yeah, we've heard. 
 You've got guns. Let's do something. 
 We already did. 
 You want them to kill more people? 
 We want the Pons to feel unsafe. 
 Now they do. 
 Well, in that case, you can both go f*ck yourselves. 
 We're just a handful of people, Frank. 
 How do you think you bring down an empire? 
 With fear. Once the Pons are scared, they stop responding an start reacting. 
 And they strike back blindly. 
 And fear spreads. 
 Fear doesn't change anything. 
 Fear changes everything, Frank. 
 It changes everything. 
 And once they're afraid, they'll turn against each other. 
 They'll tear each other apart. 
 That's how we bring down the Pons. 
 That's how freedom-loving people have always brought down empires. 
 But if you can improve on thousands of years of insurgent strategy... you know, don't hold back, Frank. 
 Speak up. 
 Yeah. 
 Done some checking in on you. 
 You're a pretty handy fella. 
 You worked at a replica factory? 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Well, if you want to do something... 
 I mean... really do something... we could use your help. 
 What kind of help? 
 Danke. 
 Joe Blake. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Buy me a drink. 
 Come on. 
 I would have ordered champagne but, after what you said to your father last night... 
 [Chuckle] 
 Sorry you had to witness that. 
 You spoke your mind. Don't apologize. 
 Since you're going to leave and never see me again, why don't you tell me what happened? 
 I don't feel comfortable talking about that. 
 That's why I'm plying you with alcohol. 
 I was congratulated for getting some people killed. 
 And did you? 
 Get them killed? 
 Not on purpose. 
 So what are you going to do back in New York? 
 I got a job working construction. 
 Construction? 
 Yeah. I know. It's not an important job, but it's an honest job. 
 It doesn't matter to you that you could do important things here. 
 Why not take advantage of your father's position? 
 Of his power? 
 Or did you come all this way just to tell him how hurt you were? 
 Hmm. The only reason that I came to Berlin is because he ordered me to. 
 I know you don't want to hear this, but your father is trying to do right by the Reich and now by you if you would give him a chance. 
 He doesn't deserve another chance. 
 Maybe not. 
 But maybe you do. 
 [Knocking] 
 Julia. Oh, how lovely you look. 
 Thank you. 
 Please. 
 Something wrong? 
 A dear friend just lost her husband. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Thomas, this is Julia Mills. 
 Uh, great. Very nice to meet you. 
 Pleasure. 
 I'm still with Mrs. Adler. 
 Do you think you can help Julia study for the ACT? 
 Oh, no, no. I'll come back tomorrow. 
 Nonsense. Thomas, you don't mind. 
 N-Not at all. 
 Thank you so much, Thomas. 
 I'm sure helping a newcomer study is the last thing you feel like doing. 
 It's okay. 
 I actually like to study. 
 So what was it like? 
 In the Pacific States, I mean. 
 Do the Japanese really think they're better than us? 
 Well, I don't know. 
 Doesn't everyone who wins feel that way? 
 I guess. 
 But if they brainwashed you with all that propaganda, this might be a little hard for you. 
 Okay. Well, it's a good thing you're here, then. 
 Uh, the ACT is made of three parts: Reading, writing, and civics. 
 Okay. I got two out of three. 
 Straight to civics, then. 
 First question: From where does justice derive? 
 Hmm. The Reich. 
 Yes, but more specifically. 
 The Führer? 
 Very good. 
 Justice is a divine right guaranteed for all and determined by the Führer, from whom all justice derives. 
 Thomas? You all right? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Next question is about American exterminations before the Reich. 
 Exterminations? 
 Didn't they ever teach you about the Indians? 
 The reprisals were carried out, Onoda-kakka. 
 Ten Americans for every soldier. 
 Good. You're dismissed. 
 Kakka, may I have the honor of hosting you at the Club Omarei? 
 I accept with pleasure. 
 I know you would enjoy it. 
 Until later, then. 
 
 
 
 I just don't get it. 
 What's a Japanese woman doing fighting the Japanese? 
 Oh, I'm not Japanese. 
 I was born in America to Japanese parents. 
 There's a big difference. 
 You never heard of Manzinar? 
 Should I have? 
 Forget it. 
 You see those soldiers over there? 
 Last week, a couple of workmen stumbled across a 2,000-pound bomb in the basement that must have been dropped during the bombardment of '45. 
 What, do you want my help getting a 2,000-pound bomb past them? 
 Not the bomb, just some of the explosive material inside. 
 Getting past them is going to be easy. 
 You got to be kidding me. 
 The Pons plan to dispose of it tomorrow. 
 If we don't do this today, we lose it forever. 
 Can you do it or not? 
 Look, I'm no expert. 
 I'd need to see exact specifications. 
 Well, I've been doing some research. 
 It's a Japanese land bomb type 80. 
 I'll get the specs to you. 
 And I'll need a second, someone with engineering skill, someone I can trust. 
 I don't know anyone like that. 
 I do. 
 How did it go? 
 Swell. She'll ace it. 
 Oh, thanks to Thomas. 
 He's been really wonderful. 
 Good. 
 I'm sorry I couldn't spend time with you. 
 Today's been just a... 
 No, please, I understand. 
 You all must be in shock. 
 I saw him just last week, and it's hard to believe... 
 Yes, it... it was very sudden. 
 I only hope he didn't suffer. 
 Thank you, Jasper. 
 Miss Mills. 
 You've been studying with my wife? 
 With Thomas, actually. 
 Huh. 
 I'm going to check with Helen. 
 Do you think you'd like to join us for dinner tomorrow night? 
 That's so kind of you. 
 You've done so much for me already. I couldn't. 
 Oh, nonsense. It's the least we can do, really. 
 Unless, of course, you've already made other friends. 
 No. I'll be here. 
 Good. I'll have Helen call you with the details. 
 Thank you. 
 [Dialing Telephone] 
 Yes, I'm looking for an address, please, in Brooklyn for a George Dixon: D-I-X-O-N. 
 We only have six days to pay the Yakuza, Frank. 
 This is important. 
 More important than staying alive? 
 That massacre on the street. 
 This is how we get back, Ed... not at the soldiers following orders but at the officers. 
 How did we even get mixed up in this? 
 Are you telling me you don't want to get even after what they did to Laura, after what they did to you? 
 We're in enough trouble already. 
 We got to stay out of this. 
 I can't do that, not anymore, not ever again. 
 I know what it feels like to fight now, and I want you to feel it, too. 
 According to the specs you gave me, it's 2 1/2 meters long, half a meter across, with a steel casing 5 millimeters thick. 
 Right. The core's filled with picric acid in crystalline form. 
 You said the fuse was crushed. 
 You'll have to go in through the plate below the drop pin. 
 You do realize we drill even a millimeter past the inner edge of the casing, we'll all blow sky high. 
 Along with our best chance of striking back at the Pons. 
 So what do we do, drill through the casing and vacuum out the crystal? 
 It's too volatile. 
 We add water. 
 Turn them into liquid, siphon them into a canister using a pump. 
 You guys have all the tools you need? 
 Uh, tools aren't the problem. 
 No. The problem is we don't know what we're doing. 
 And if we mess this up, we're all going to die. 
 This is crazy, Frank. 
 But think of the damage we can do to the Pons. 
 And I'll be down there with you. 
 And I say it's a risk worth taking. 
 [Chatter] 
 If anybody sees you, you know what to do. 
 Ed : Frank. 
 Thanks. 
 What am I forgetting? 
 To breathe. 
 Yeah. 
 All right, here we go. 
 [Drilling] 
 What happened? 
 It's okay, it's okay. 
 All right, give me the cobalt bit. 
 You should have used cobalt to start with. 
 Yeah, well, we'll know that for the next bomb, won't we? 
 Here. 
 [Drilling] 
 Almost there. 
 Stop. 
 [Panting] 
 Give me the flashlight. 
 Looks like we didn't cut all the way through. 
 You keep drilling, you'll trigger the bomb. 
 I'm going to have to finish with the hand tool. 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 [Knocking] 
 Can I help you? 
 Uh, yes. I'm here to see George. 
 Does George Dixon live here? 
 I'm sorry. Mr. Dixon moved several months ago. 
 I see. 
 But he does stop by occasionally to pick up his mail. 
 Okay. Um, well, I'm an old family friend. 
 Uh, let me just leave you my name and my number. 
 If you wouldn't mind giving this to him when you see him, I'd greatly appreciate it. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Excuse me, Miss. 
 Juliana! 
 We are now boarding train number 91, now boarding at Gate 1415. 
 Thank you. 
 A schedule, please. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Juliana : Thank you. 
 Where have you been hiding? It's been so long. 
 I'm sorry, Miss. You've mistaken me for... 
 Oh, Henry, don't be standoffish. 
 My name is Bill. 
 Bill, I'm teasing. 
 Can't take a joke? 
 Of course I can. 
 Good. 
 Is that what this is? A joke? 
 Just... Just go with it, okay? Don't spoil it. 
 Okay. It's just that... 
 Fate brought us together today. 
 You believe in fate, don't you? 
 I believe in fate. 
 I do. 
 I really do. 
 It's just that I am married and my wife will be out any... Mm! 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 Huh? Hon... 
 That's my husband, you floozy! 
 Come on, come on! 
 Go that side. 
 Ohh. 
 Sara. 
 Yeah. 
 That place you mentioned. 
 The, uh, Man... Man-something. 
 Manzinar. 
 Yeah. 
 Why didn't you tell me about it? 
 It's just a patch of dirt, really. 
 About ten hours from here. 
 We were relocated there by the U.S. Army. 
 My family and thousands of other Japanese people. 
 American citizens suddenly considered enemy aliens. 
 My dad said, "Sara, one fine day, they'll win, and they'll open that gate." 
 He meant the Japanese Empire. 
 And one fine day, they did win. 
 Ed : One fine day for you. 
 Yeah. 
 They won. 
 But they looked at us, an all they could see was that we left Japan. 
 We weren't Americans, but we weren't Japanese, either. 
 We were... hangyakunin. 
 Yeah, traitors. 
 So you hate the Americans. 
 You hate the Pons. 
 Who are you fighting for? 
 I don't hate anyone. 
 [Sigh] 
 Bingo. We got it. 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 Victory. 
 Mm. 
 You don't like to drink, do you, Kido-tai'i? 
 I am happy to drink with you, Kakka. 
 I must warn you. 
 I can always tell when someone is lying. 
 And you lie out of respect, Kido-tai'i. 
 I like you. 
 Leave us. 
 These are dark days for the Empire. 
 Darkness? 
 We may be the superior race, but we have fallen behind our enemies, now that the Crown Prince is shot, our men gunned down on the streets. 
 Of course you are right, Onoda-kakka, but wherever there is power there is subversion, whether in Manchuria or here. 
 Kakka, may I raise with you again the subject of the films? 
 You missed the point, Kido-tai'i. 
 We are seen as weak. 
 If a nation is seen as weak, it is weak. 
 ♪ Gonna set my heart at ease ♪ 
♪ Gonna make a sentimental journey ♪ 
♪ To renew old memories ♪ 
 Keep pumping. 
 Fill her up. 
 Ed, you can go home. 
 Sara and Frank, you can lay low here with the stuff. 
 I'll send you a message where to stash it, okay? 
 Hey. 
 I think they can take it from here. 
 We should get back. 
 I'm going to help them finish. 
 You go ahead. 
 You go ahead. Well... 
 Well... what about our obligation? 
 I bet Childan's tearing his hair out. 
 I'll be back as soon as I can. 
 Gary : Come on, Ed. I'll give you a lift. 
 [Car Door Opens] 
 [Car Door Closes] 
 Mm. 
 Oi. More whiskey. 
 And you will drink it with us. 
 Hmm. 
 Of course, Onoda-kakka. 
 I'm afraid I don't drink whiskey. 
 You two make a fine pair, And I order you to leave that button undone. 
 Hmm. 
 What do you drink? We will order that. 
 I... like port. 
 Nobody drinks that around here. 
 We'll have the Nazis send some. 
 They will do as they are told. 
 Isn't that so, Kido? 
 But perhaps it is best to go home. 
 Yes. It is time. 
 Mm! 
 Kakka. [Chuckle] 
 Ah, before we leave, might I have your seal on that routine order we discussed? 
 Seal. 
 [Clatter] 
 Hai. 
 [Grunting] 
 Routine order. 
 Kakka. 
 Hai. 
 [Grunt] Mm. 
 So they left you and your family to rot in Manzinar. 
 I would think that would crush your spirit, but you're this... 
 I'm this what? 
 I was going to say firebrand, but that sounded... [Chuckle] bad. 
 It sounds nice. 
 So why are you? 
 I was probably about 7 or 8 when, um, a few dozen inmates staged a hunger strike. 
 I stood in the corner, scared as hell, watching the guards come. 
 Do you really want to hear this? 
 Yeah. 
 They got beaten down. 
 They were kicked and punched. Their hands were bloodied. 
 And then they stood up again... knowing that they'd only get beaten down again. 
 And watching them do that... was the first time in my life that I felt... something like... defiance. 
 It was a... a thrill. 
 Hey. 
 Coming to bed? 
 Helen? 
 You know I spent the whole afternoon with Alice. 
 Yeah, you said. 
 Uh... she must be... devastated. 
 She is. She's devastated. 
 John, I'm going to ask you a question, and I need for you to tell me the truth. 
 Helen. 
 Don't. 
 John, what have you done? 
 Don't ask me any more. 
 But wh-why? 
 Look at me. 
 All you need to know is everything I do... everything... 
 I do it for the family, to keep our children safe. 
 For the family? 
 Our son is ill. 
 I knew that there was something. 
 Gerry was going to report him. 
 But that is no reason for you to... 
 There's no cure. 
 There's no cure. 
 Mm. 
 Mm, uh... 
 What... What... What are you going... 
 What are we going to do? 
 We're not going to kill him. 
 We're not going to kill our son. 
 But they're going to make us. 
 A man of your rank, and if we don't, then they are going to take my babies away from me. 
 No, they won't. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Of course they will. They are going to kill your son. 
 Do you trust me, Helen? 
 Do you trust me, Helen? 
 Yes. 
 It's not going to happen, all right? 
 They're not going to do it... because I'm no going to let them do it. 
 [Ring] 
 [Ring] 
 [Ring] 
 [Ring] 
 Hello. 
 Man : Look out your window. 
 Who is this? 
 Pick up your phone, take it to the window, and look outside. 
 I hear you've been looking for me. 
 I'm George Dixon. 
 George?
