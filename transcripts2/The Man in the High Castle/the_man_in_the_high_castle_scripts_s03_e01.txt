 - Juliana. Take this. 
- What is it?   
 A way out.   
 - (GUNSHOT) 
- (GASPS)   
 - What is this? 
- It's newsreel film.   
 - The Man in the High Castle. 
- It shows us winning the war.   
 - Yeah, but we didn't win the war. 
- Once the Fuhrer dies, there will be war.   
 - (MAN SPEAKS GERMAN) 
- TAGOMI: This is our moment.   
 We must not hesitate to seize it.    
 They're building an atomic bomb.    
 JULIANA: You take me to the Man in the High Castle.    
 Ask him if he wants to see me.    
 - You're him, aren't you? 
- I'm Abendsen.    
 Hawthorne Abendsen.    
 Every film where the Japs won the war, sooner or later San Francisco is wiped out by an A-bomb,    
 every one except this one, where this b*st*rd dies as a Nazi    
 - in an alley somewhere. 
- His name is George Dixon.    
 What's he got to do with Trudy?    
 He's her father.    
 JULIANA: I need a diplomatic visa to get out of the Pacific States.    
 TAGOMI: But if by trying, you compound tragedy...    
 My name is Juliana Crain.    
 I work with Joe Blake. I need asylum.    
 SMITH: I have orders for you, from Berlin, from Reichsminister Heusmann.    
 JOE: And what makes either of you think    
 - I want to see him? 
- He's your father.    
 Your father is one of the most powerful men in the Reich.    
 He could get you anything you want.    
 Anything he wants to give me, I don't want it.    
 HEUSMANN: Have you heard of Lebensborn?    
 Racially desirable women volunteer to have the babies at the Lebensborn birthing houses, to be raised in line with the party ideals.    
 This was your birthing house, Josef.    
 Reichsfuhrer Himmler.    
 I'm your godfather.    
 I look forward to seeing a great deal more of you.    
 ADLER: Your son has a serious disease.    
 You know what must be done.    
 - Give me more time. 
- Withholding his diagnosis is a crime against the state.    
 If you won't take care of this today, I'll have to do it tomorrow.    
 (MUFFLED YELLING)    
 JOHN: What happened is just a terrible tragedy, Alice.    
 What if it's more than that?    
 GARY: You flip the switch, and you get the hell out of there.

 Plenty, as long as you head straight for the exit.

 TAGOMI: I went to the park to meditate.    
 It brought me to a strange place.    
 It was San Francisco, but not this San Francisco.    
 You are different than what I remember.    
 You are free.    
 Why do you want this?    
 TAGOMI: Proof that something like this should never happen again.    
 KIDO: Our empire does not possess such a device.    
 The film is real.    
 TAGOMI: With your help, it is my intention to show this film.    
 SMITH: What you're seeing, gentlemen, is a hydrogen bomb, with a magnitude a thousand times more powerful    
 - than anything in our arsenal. 
- HEUSMANN: I know the casualties will be higher, but that may be necessary.    
 You can't build a better world if there's nothing left of it!    
 - What the hell's going on? 
- Your father's a traitor, Joe.    
 Sieg heil! Sieg heil!    
 Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

 (DISTORTED, ECHOING SCREAM)    
 You knew what would happen. You showed me the film,    
 - and you knew. 
- No, the only thing    
 I knew was that you, Juliana Crain, were the only hope any of us had.    
 You were in the films, over and over again.    
 Some of the people you knew, we started seeing them, too, revolving around you, like an atom... they would change, different behavior, different relationships, different points of view.    
 I knew that was the key.    
 The goodness in you, Juliana.     
 That's what I put my money on.     
 Hey, sis.

 Sorry.     
 Billy Turner. Minister of Propaganda, and world-class idiot.     
 Welcome to New York, Fraulein.     
 - First time? 
- Hardly.     
 - Miss Dormer... 
- Nicole.     
 Nicole. I think there are some transatlantic crossed wires on this little renaming ceremony.     
 "Fascism is freedom"?     
 "Freedom to prosper."     
 "Freedom to explore."     
 "Freedom from fear."     
 "Freedom to propagate"?     
 - That's the new campaign. 
- New?     
 Sounds rather familiar.     
 Brand-new.     
 "Procreate to Populate, with Pride"?     
 That's the spring rollout to inspire our young brides to...     
 f*ck and be fertile?     
 I wouldn't quite put it that way.     
 This image is perfect for a message from the Reich.     
 Warmer, more maternal.     
 Something like... forgive my English... perhaps... "Now more than ever, we care about you."     
 That's not bad.     
 But let's not get ahead of ourselves, schatzi.     
 Agreed. Let's not.     
 I have thoughts of how to film it.     
 Yeah, well, what I was starting to say, we're... we're doing that in-house. Got our top people on it.     
 (LAUGHS) Silly me. I forgot.     
 My uncle desires a fresh face for the new propaganda effort in America.     
 Reichsminister Goebbels is your uncle?     
 In a manner of speaking.     
 I see.     
 Wunderbar. So happy you see.     
 Because we don't have much time to prepare.     
 I'll need three cameras, a crew and a crane.     
 Danke, schatzi.     
 See you at the premiere.

 Dear friends and neighbors, we are most privileged to have with us the Reichsmarschall of North America,     
 George Lincoln Rockwell.     
 We gather here today to honor... a true hero of the Reich.     
 When the hour of decision came for Thomas Smith, he rose to the occasion in a way that admirably reflected upon his father.     
 Without wavering,  without self-pity...     
 - Zoom in. 
- ... Thomas Smith, on his own, made the ultimate sacrifice for a community, a country,  a cause.     
 Surely, Thomas Smith shall forever stand a peerless exemplar... of Aryan youth.     
 And as we remember this day, let us absorb a great lesson:     
 In the hour of decision, in the hour of crisis, when we look for leadership, and for courage, to whom do we look?     
 Pan to the Smith family.
