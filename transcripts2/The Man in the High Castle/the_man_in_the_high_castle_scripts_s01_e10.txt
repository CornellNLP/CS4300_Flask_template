 What was that? 
 A nightmare. 
 With me in it. How is that possible? 
 I don't know. 
 Frank. 
 There was another man kneeling near you in the film. Did you recognize him? 
 What? No. Why? 
 He looked familiar to me. 
 [door closes] 
 Bad news. I didn't find a way out. 
 What is it? Something happen? 
 Everything's fine. 
 Okay, so give me the film. 
 No. 
 No. 
 Stop it. Stop. 
 You Nazi f*ck! 
 Tell me it isn't true. 
 Tell me it isn't true. 
 Please tell me it isn't true. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [door closes] 
 [rifle cocked] 
 Helen : John? 
 I couldn't sleep. 
 If he simply wanted me dead, Helen, he wouldn't need to invite me hunting. 
 Heydrich scares me, John. 
 H-He says it's for the glory of the Reich, but he enjoys the things that he does. 
 Listen to me, Helen. 
 I need you to promise me something. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 If for whatever reason I don't make it back... don't let that man near our children. 
 [door opens] 
 [door closes] 
 [knock on door] 
 Enter. 
 [speaking Japanese] 
 This is our world now, Sergeant. 
 Part of the Empire. 
 And it is our duty to sacrifice whatever is necessary to protect it. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Karen : You don't ever watch the films. 
 No exceptions. 
 It doesn't matter to us what you saw. 
 I just saw myself being executed by Joe Blake. 
 And the whole city destroyed by an A bomb. 
 We just paid the Yakuza 10,000 yen for you, and now you're asking us to get you out? 
 Look, Frank's wanted by the Kempeitai. 
 And neither of you thought to mention that? 
 Will you help us or not? 
 [sigh] 
 [voices on television] 
 Major Karl Müller of the Reich? 
 Kempeitai Chief Inspector Kido. 
 Please come in. 
 [floor creaks] 
 Chief Inspector. 
 This belongs to you? 
 Yes, Inspector. 
 And I'm prepared to make a full confession. 
 [no audible dialogue] 
 Okay. We can get you out. 
 But it's going to cost you. 
 We don't have anything left. 
 What do you want? 
 Your help getting that film back from Joe Blake and killing him. 
 Help us do that, and I'm cleared to put you on a boat to Mexico. 
 Killing him? A few hours ago, I gave everything I had to save the son of a bitch. 
 Wait. Because of what's on the film? 
 Because he's a goddamn Nazi. 
 You said he didn't deny it. 
 He makes it back to New York, that film and all of our names go to Nazi High Command. 
 f*ck. 
 Juliana. 
 You're the only one who stands a chance of getting close enough to him to do it and grab the film. 
 Lemuel : You're the only one he trusts. 
 You want to kill him? 
 You go right ahead, but leave her out of it. 
 Well, you did it before. 
 The Nazi agent back in Canon City. 
 That was self-defense. 
 You're asking me to kill a man in cold blood, to assassinate him. 
 Ah... 
 No. 
 I can't do that. 
 I won't do that. 
 I know. 
 Uh... 
 I'll do it. 
 Fish to the lure. 
 You get him someplace where I can get a nice clean decent shot. 
 I'll do the rest. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Go through his desk. 
 Anything official must be destroyed. 
 I do not understand, sir. 
 I think you do, Sergeant. 
 What is this man's crime? 
 The shooting of the Crown Prince. 
 Hai. 
 But we've been pursuing Frank Frink. 
 The witness said Frank never discharged his weapon. 
 Then why not arrest and interrogate this man? 
 Because that is exactly what the Nazis would want us to do. 
 There'd be war. 
 A war that currently our Empire cannot win. 
 Nobody must ever know about this, Sergeant. 
 But if Frink is gone and we cannot report the capture of the real assassin, how can Tokyo be satisfied? 
 Whatever sacrifice is necessary. 
 That is my burden alone, and I shall carry it. 
 Yours is to remain silent and to act as my Kaishakunin. 
 Now do you understand, Yoshida-san? 
 Hai. 
 The desk. 
 Oberstgruppenführer. 
 Sieg heil. 
 Good morning, John. 
 This is Junge, my aid. 
 I brought rifles for both of us, John. 
 Oh, thank you. I prefer to use my own. 
 Karen : I need you to listen to me carefully, Juliana. 
 He's a Nazi, so the Embassy is the only place he can go now. 
 Once you're inside, ask for the visa office. 
 It's on the eighth floor. 
 They'll send you to the back stairs, and that gives you access to all levels. 
 Somebody will tell me if you managed to contact Obergruppenführer Smith. 
 Yes, Mr. Blake. 
 He'll probably be in one of the ad men offices... levels 4 to 6. 
 We can get you in, but you have to get him out. 
 You'll need a story. He'll be suspicious. 
 I'll come up with something. 
 Heydrich : I felt we should clear the air, you and I, rid ourselves of the suspicion that seems to have developed between us. 
 We can speak candidly here. 
 Nobody can hear us or reach us. 
 I assumed that was the point. 
 [chuckling] You are a formidable man, John. 
 You believe Captain Connolly had a hand in the ambush on your car? 
 As Captain Connolly killed himself yesterday, sadly we can only speculate. 
 You must at least suspect I gave the order. 
 It's understandable. 
 There is, after all, strong precedent for senior figures removing comrades in pursuit of the greater good. but sometimes such figures underestimate their comrades. 
 I would hate to make that mistake. 
 The world will change forever today. 
 It's too late for us to do anything about that. 
 Now it's simply a question of whether you are part of the future or the past.

 Mr. Blake. 
 Ambassador Hugo Reiss. 
 This is Oberführer Diels. 
 Heil Hitler. 
 Heil Hitler. 
 My staff booked you on the first rocket back to New York. 
 You leave in a few hours. 
 Make yourself comfortable in here until then. 
 I have further meetings. 
 Okay. Thank you, sir. 
 You report to Obergruppenführer Smith, do you not, Mr. Blake? 
 Yeah, that's correct. 
 Have you spoken to him? 
 We're still trying to reach him. 
 So your mission here was a success? 
 I can't really talk about that. 
 Of course. 
 [speaking Japanese] 
 Chief Inspector Kido, Trade Minister. 
 Juliana Crain. 
 Miss Crain is not in the office today. 
 I am aware of that. 
 Nor will she be ever again. 
 She is the girlfriend of Frank Frink, the man wanted in connection with the shooting of the Crown Prince. 
 I'm sure there must be some mistake. 
 There have undoubtedly been several, along with warnings unheeded. 
 I am sorry, Trade Minister. 
 I can do nothing about the loss of face you will suffer in connection with this as and when Mr. Frink is inevitably apprehended. 
 But this time there can be no mitigation. 
 This time? 
 Did you really think I did not know who helped the Nazi Wegener to leave? 
 However, I also knew why you did so. 
 Please, do not imagine I remained silent for any other reason than your own: the security of the Empire. 
 Why are you telling me now? 
 Because there comes a time when all men must bear the weight of their responsibility, Trade Minister. 
 And our day has come. 
 Goodbye. 
 Chief Inspector Kido. 
 Arigato.

 Papa. 
 Klaudia. Mm. 
 Otto. 
 Good luck. 
 It's going to be okay. 
 In a few hours we'll be free of all this. 
 Running away isn't the same as being free. 
 Look, I want you to promise me. 
 If anything happens, you get on that boat. 
 Hey, don't even think that. 
 Think about what's on the other side. 
 That film shows Joe as a Nazi, and he is. 
 I got on that bus with Trudy's film because I thought it meant hope for the future. 
 But this new one means that everything I've done and everything I've caused has been for nothing. 
 There is no hope. 
 There's no future. 
 But we have to go on. 
 What else is there? 
 Okay. 
 Let's go. 
 Ed. 
 What are you doing in here? 
 Uh... 
 I, uh, I messed up on the detailing, sir. 
 I thought I'd melt it before production tallies were recorded. 
 You're too much of a damn perfectionist. 
 This barrel's been bored out. 
 Sir... 
 Tell me this is not what the Kempeitai are looking for. 
 [speaking Japanese] 
 Trade Minister. 
 Your meeting, Trade Minister. 
 The only way... to view the truth of life, Kotomichi... is to stand apart from it, to see... the consequence of every thought, every action. 
 But still... we are bound by time and space, unable to steer our destiny. 
 That is why you consult the I ching... to glimpse what lies ahead. 
 I'm nothing but a misguided fool, Kotomichi. 
 No. 
 You are a good man. 
 Perhaps too good for this world. 
 You must not lose faith, Trade Minister. 
 You must not give up on meditation and not on searching. 
 You must not... 
 Kotomichi, what's the matter? 
 The mine owners and General Hata are waiting for you in Bara. 
 Cancel it. 
 I'll be leaving for the day.

 Sir. 
 Ambassador Reiss. 
 No. He's not here at the moment. 
 Mr. Blake, This is Major Klemm. 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 Here. I've been here like I was told. 
 They didn't call you? 
 No. I called the ambassador to find out if he'd heard from you. 
 Listen to me very carefully, Mr. Blake. 
 Obergruppenführer Smith has left word. 
 Diels reports directly to Heydrich. 
 You are to stay away from Diels at all costs. 
 Oberführer Diels. 
 Please come with me. 
 I need a team to the Embassy immediately. 
 Yes, sir. 
 The car to take you to the airport is waiting, Mr. Blake. 
 Have you heard from Obergruppenführer Smith? 
 Oh, yes. He's expecting you. 
 Please come with me. 
 What news on Joe Blake's mission in the Pacific States? 
 I take it you sent him to retrieve one of the films the Führer finds so interesting. 
 I'm sorry. I can't discuss that. 
 [rifle cocked] 
 Time to talk plainly, John. 
 Good luck. 
 [chatter in German] 
 Basement level, Mr. Blake. 
 I can't leave by the front entrance? 
 Your safety is of paramount concern to us. 
 Please. 
 Of course. 
 [speaking German] 
 I'm just here for a visa application. 
 Visa application. 
 Ja. 
 You can pass. 
 Danke schoen. 
 All the way to the basement, Mr. Blake. 
 [Men speaking German] 
 Joe. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 How did you get in here? 
 You're not the only one who can lie. 
 Wait. Not that way. 
 What the hell were you doing there? 
 You lying son of a bitch! 
 I had to know if it was true. 
 Bullshit. You came for the film. 
 That's all you care about. 
 That is not true. 
 Then why? 
 The Resistance sent me to lure you out so they can kill you. 
 And you'd do that? 
 I've seen who you really are. 
 What are you talking about? 
 We watched the film, Joe. You're in it. 
 You're wearing a Nazi uniform, and you're executing people. 
 I don't know what you've seen, but whatever it is, it wasn't me. 
 That's not who I am. 
 You want to know how I know? 
 Guess what I saw on the film I took to Canon City. 
 You said you never watched the film. 
 I didn't tell you because you were so full of hope. 
 You saw the Allies winning, right? 
 Well, mine wasn't newsreel. 
 It was Soviet propaganda for Josef Stalin from 1954. 
 Stalin was executed... 
 In '49, exactly. 
 So whatever you saw is no more real than Stalin coming back from the dead. 
 You know what is real? 
 If I don't get this film back to New York, I'm a dead man. 
 And the man I report to won't just kill me. 
 He'll kill you, Frank, and people you're close to. 
 Help me, and I'll keep all those names he doesn't know out of it. 
 I swear to you. 
 Does this belong to you, Mr. McCarthy? 
 Yes, sir. 
 You converted it? 
 That's right. 
 And you tried to destroy it because... 
 Possession of a firearm is a very serious offense. 
 But not as serious as attempting to assassinate the Crown Prince of Japan. 
 This distinctive weapon was described by several witnesses. 
 We know at least two bullets were fired from this gun. 
 We are continuing to pursue Mr. Frank Frink for this crime, but if you say this gun belongs to you, that changes everything. 
 Do you know where Frank is? 
 That is not relevant to the truth. 
 The only relevant question is did you use this gun to shoot the Crown Prince? 
 What is the power of the films? 
 Do you know why the Führer prizes them so highly? 
 You'd have to address any questions on that subject to the Führer himself. 
 The Führer is a spent force, John. 
 We both know that. 
 I don't believe for a second that sharing the land of your birth with the Japanese sits well with you. 
 I'm sure the Führer has his reasons. 
 Loyalty is an overrated virtue, John, championed by the bovine, dignified by the weak to justify their weakness. 
 It's certainly not worthy of you. 
 Neither is betrayal. 
 Ultimately, John, we owe our hearts and our minds not to any one man but to an idea, and that idea is under threat. 
 It is up to the best of us to step forward now as both the Führer and nature demands. 
 The strong must overcome the weak. 
 Very shortly now, John, the telephone is going to ring. 
 Who will be calling? 
 I suspect you already worked that out on our walk. 
 Nein! 
 The American Reich is vital to our interests. 
 I'd like you with me, and I would be willing to hear what you would want for yourself. 
 However, I need to be sure I can call on the same level of commitment as the Führer. 
 I have to hear your decision before I receive the call. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. I understand. 
 Was that Lem? 
 No. We got to go. 
 At least there should be fewer Kempeitai around. 
 Why? 
 They caught the guy who shot the Crown Prince. 
 Who? 
 I don't know. 
 Some guy who works in a gun factory. 
 Come on, Frank. We got to move. 
 I got to make a call. 
 No. We don't have time for that. 
 [line ringing] 
 Mr. McCarthy, it's Frank. Is Ed there? 
 You selfish piece of sh1t. 
 They'll kill him. You know that. 
 And all because of you. 
 Go without me. 
 What happened? 
 Get Juliana away. 
 [film projector whirring] 
 Sieg heil! 
 Heydrich : Well, John? 
 Rudolph will never get a weapon close enough to Führer to kill him. 
 Our leader's paranoia at least has one advantage. 
 He hides weapons everywhere. 
 I need to know one thing, Reinhard. 
 I need to know you're not alone in this. 
 [ring] 
 [ring] 
 [ring] 
 [ring] 
 No, John. I am not alone in this. 
 Now, are you with me? 
 Reinhard. 
 Mein Führer. 
 [hyperventilating] 
 [gunshot] 
 There it is. 
 I really appreciate you doing this. 
 What, sending you to Mexico? 
 No, believing in me. 
 Not many people have ever done that. 
 Come on. 
 She did it. 
 Do you hear me? She f*cking did it. 
 Atta girl. 
 They're on their way to you. 
 She should take him through that door any moment. 
 Copy that. 
 I guess it's too late to ask you to go with me. 
 I'm sorry, Joe. 
 Wow. 
 You're good. 
 Sniper? 
 No. 
 Yeah, you know, I'm sorry, too. 
 For everything. 
 You said once to me that I might be a different man if I'd met you sooner. 
 Please. 
 Well, I am. 
 You changed me. 
 That's why I'm not the guy in this film. 
 I'm still glad I met you. 
 Oh, God. 
 I don't believe the film. 
 I don't believe it. 
 I believe you. 
 Hey. 
 No. No! 
 No! Ed! 
 Ed, no! No! 
 I'm here! 
 I'm here! 
 Where the f*ck are they? 
 They should be with you. 
 sh1t. 
 Get out there! 
 Ah, damn it. 
 What have you done?
