 [speaking Japanese] 
 Gruppenführer Keller. Welcome. 
 I trust you and your men are well rested since the flight to Berlin. 
 They're eager to crush this so-called uprising. 
 Hmm. Perhaps you could apprise the Gruppenführer of the latest developments. 
 The Führer's death was clearly a trigger. 
 There have been incidents in every major city along the Eastern Seaboard as well as the Midwest... specifically Chicago, where... 
 Our true enemy are the Japanese, not these criminals. 
 It is your decision where to best utilize me and my men, Obergruppenführer, but acting Chancellor Heusmann's hope is that our reinforcements will help you end this destruction. 
 Well, since you plainly have the confidence of Berlin, Gruppenführer, perhaps you could tell me what additional steps I should take. 
 First that you make an example. 
 Which city is reporting the most unrest? 
 Larry. 
 Savannah, Georgia, sir. 
 I suggest we raze it. 
 I see. 
 What's the population of Savannah, Erich? 
 Roughly 84,000, sir. 
 84,000. 
 Well, thank you, Gruppenführer. 
 I will certainly take your suggestions into account. 
 I will make the necessary preparations. 
 Our empire does not possess such a device. 
 No. We do not. 
 And yet... that test was clearly conducted in Empire territory. 
 Bikini Atoll, in the Marshall Islands. 
 Propaganda films cannot fake such detail. 
 The film is real, Kido-tai'i. 
 With your help, it is my intention to show this film to Ambassador Reiss. 
 Impossible. 
 Ambassador Reiss and the Nazis have already evacuated the city. 
 Impossible is not an option. 
 [speaking German] 
 I can see the consternation in your eyes, Josef. 
 Speak your mind. 
 All those people. 
 Yeah. I know. 
 It would be terrible. 
 But we have a responsibility. 
 Like getting justice for the Führer. 
 No, Josef. I mean the most important responsibility. 
 That's the Master Race to imagine and build a better world. 
 How is going to war with the Japanese going to achieve that? 
 Our alliance with them was always a lie. 
 There is only one Master Race. 
 Therefore, the burden falls on us. 
 What burden? 
 To end mankind's constant state of war so the real work... progress, perfection... can finally begin. 
 By killing millions of people? 
 Josef, this war will be terrible, yes, but this will be the last war. 
 And when it is over, we will have a world united and at peace for the first time in human history. 
 Imagine, Josef. 
 Imagine what humanity will then be able to achieve. 
 Where have you been? 
 We've been worried sick. 
 I sent the girls to Mary's. 
 Where is he? 
 In there. 
 Thomas. 
 You both lied to me. 
 There's something wrong with me. 
 I know there is. 
 I want you to sit down. 
 Was I really selected to go on the trip to South America, or was that a lie, too? 
 Please, Thomas, just... Please. 
 Please, just... just tell me the truth. 
 You don't need to know all of the details. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 Thomas, uh... you know, the truth is we have been keeping something from you, and it's because we love you. 
 We... We didn't want to scare you, but I think we... we both know we were wrong to do that. 
 You have a form of muscular dystrophy. 
 It's a disease that affects the muscles. 
 That's why you've been having these, uh, occasional episodes. 
 Um... can I be cured? 
 Well, the symptoms may get worse, but it doesn't mean you're not going to have a full life, Thomas. 
 You understand? It doesn't mean you're not going to be happy. 
 Can I be cured? 
 No. 
 I've let you down. 
 I'm a useless eater. 
 No. 
 What? 
 No. 
 No. 
 No, you haven't. 
 You haven't. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You haven't. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Do you have any idea how proud we are of you? 
 [chuckle] 
 But I'm defective. 
 Don't you ever say that. 
 No. To us, you... you are perfect. 
 The law clearly states... 
 You don't have any worry about the law, okay? 
 Now listen to me, Thomas. 
 Everything that's happening now, I know it's very scary. 
 But I promise you it's going to be okay. 
 You believe me? 
 You're going to be okay. 
 [phone rings] 
 [ring] 
 [ring] 
 Ohh. 
 [ring] 
 [ring] 
 Yes? 
 Obergruppenführer Smith? 
 Who is this? 
 SS Security. 
 Lincoln-Rockwell Airport. 
 I'm sorry to bother you at home, sir, but we have a Japanese national in our custody... 
 Chief Inspector Takeshi Kido. 
 I see. 
 He claims he's here at your invitation, but diplomatic visas have been revoked. 
 Should I arrest him, sir? 
 No. That won't be necessary. 
 Send a car. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Return his belongings. 
 Thank you. 
 The SS are looking for you. 
 We're moving you to a safe house. 
 You told me you were getting me to the Neutral Zone. 
 The troops are moving west, so it's safer to stay off the roads. 
 No, no. I did everything you asked. 
 You get me the hell out of here now. 
 That's just not an option. 
 We had a f*cking deal, George. 
 Oh. Like the one where you're going to tell us anything you had on the Smiths? 
 Yeah, that one. I did that. 
 Mm. 
 What about your little chat you just had with Thomas? 
 I warned you. Your building is wired. 
 Who do you think installed the lines? 
 [chuckle] It's perfect. 
 You're spying on me. 
 You should have told us that Thomas was sick. 
 You leave him the hell out of this. 
 Do you know how many of our people died trying to bring down Smith? 
 This is the silver bullet. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 Smith is committing a crime against the state... concealing his son's illness. 
 We get this out to our pirate radio people, we don't have to assassinate him. 
 The Nazis will execute him for us. 
 The hypocrite won't last an hour. 
 Yeah, and then they'll kill Thomas, and he's just a f*cking kid, George! 
 Who grew up to be a Nazi. 
 He's sick anyway. 
 You sound just like them. 
 What's all this now? 
 I'll tell you later. 
 I have to get Juliana out of here. 
 Then you'd better get ready. 
 You wait here. I'll be right back. 
 What do you mean, wait here? Where are you going? 
 There are checkpoints everywhere. 
 I've got to do something. 
 Thanks. 
 Poor George. 
 He thinks, by saving your life, he's doing right by Trudy. 
 But you don't. 
 Go ahead and look. 
 My family was in D.C. when the big one dropped. 
 I didn't know your sister that well. 
 She wasn't with us for long. 
 But I never doubted whose side she was on. 
 I'm pretty much done trying to convince you people. 
 We made a deal. 
 You going to keep it or not? 
 A message from a friend back in San Francisco. 
 Karen Vecchione. 
 Damn it! 
 Uhh... 
 [gunshot] 
 [sobbing] 
 You stay back. 
 Hey, p-put the gun down. 
 It's a disguise. 
 What the hell did they do to you? 
 Did you know? 
 Look, Juliana, let me help you, okay? 
 You f*cking... You all lied! 
 Now give me the tape! 
 I'm not going to do that. 
 Look at you in that uniform. 
 It suits you. 
 If you don't want my f*cking help, fine. You're on your own. 
 You give me that f*cking tape, or you are no better than the Nazis. 
 Good! Because if we're going to beat them, we need to be worse. 
 Please! 
 Please! 
 I do believe my father wants what's best. 
 But this can't be the way. 
 Well, is his mind made up? 
 Which is why I have to do something. 
 You did. 
 You made your opposition known to the acting Chancellor of the Reich. 
 Those are just words. 
 You spoke aloud what others would not dare think. 
 And it didn't do anything. 
 Because it's not our turn, Joe. 
 The Reich still belongs to the old men... your father and mine, the Himmlers and the Goebbels and all the rest of them. 
 But they will be gone soon, and we need to look beyond their wars to what we will build after. 
 If there's anything left, Nicole. 
 Look. 
 You said you put your faith in a person, not a cause. 
 Well, I put my faith in you. 
 [projector off] 
 Was it one of his? 
 The Man In the High Castle? 
 Aside from the late Führer, does anyone else in the Reich know about these films or their true nature? 
 The Empire did not assassinate your Führer. 
 Our nations will go to war based on a lie. 
 Why bring it to me? 
 If there is war, Heydrich and his co-conspirators will be the only victors. 
 And we will both have failed in our duty. 
 Leave it with me. 
 Where will you go? 
 I would ask your driver to deliver me to the Japanese Embassy. 
 If I fail... you may not be safe there. 
 If you fail... 
 I prefer to die on Japanese soil. 
 [phone rings] 
 Excuse me. 
 [ring] 
 Raeder. 
 Erich, I need you to pull up the files on our friend in the basement. 
 Yes, sir. I understand. 
 
 
 
 What's going on? 
 [sigh] 
 I have to go to Berlin. 
 Now? 
 No. 
 It's just for a couple of days. 
 Don't you dare. 
 What did I say? You don't trust me. 
 Trust you? Trust is not going to fix this, John. 
 Nothing will. 
 It's in your blood. 
 Helen... 
 Your brother had it. 
 Stop it. 
 Now my son... 
 Stop it. 
 ...has it. My daughters. 
 Even if they aren't sick with this, they certainly carry it. 
 Be quiet. 
 We're going to get through this. 
 Let's just stick to the plan. 
 The plan? 
 The plan where I never get to see my son again? 
 That plan? 
 No, you make another... you make another plan, or the girls and I, we go with Thomas someplace where your genetic defect isn't a threat to us. 
 I love you. 
 Sir. 
 Wait outside the car, Corporal. 
 You bring the file? 
 Yes, sir. 
 [briefcase unlatches] 
 Tape it. 
 I want you to stand down the Savannah operation. 
 I won't burn one of our own cities. 
 Yes, sir. 
 And, Erich. 
 I'm going to Berlin. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Once the Gruppenführer finds out, he will assume command, and he will order your arrest. 
 I know. And that's why it's essential I reach Berlin before he knows I'm gone. 
 As far as I know, sir... you're sequestered at home. 
 If I may ask... 
 Don't. 
 If I succeed... then you'll understand. 
 Thank you, Erich. 
 John. 
 Hello, Joe. 
 Is there somewhere we can talk? 
 In private? 
 I need your help, Joe. 
 I need you to show this to your father. 
 Why should I help you? 
 It's proof that the Japanese have the bomb. 
 Bullshit. 
 You watch it for yourself. 
 Your father is about to start a war based on the assumption the Japanese won't retaliate, but they will. 
 If you don't help me, Joe, your home's going to become a wasteland. 
 If it's so important, why don't you take it to my father yourself? 
 Because they'd arrest me. 
 My orders were to stay in New York. 
 My presence here is, uh, unauthorized. 
 Why should I trust you? 
 You lied to me since the day we met. 
 You knew I was Lebensborn. 
 You knew I was Heusmann's only son. 
 It's the only reason that you kept me around... so that one day you could cash in. 
 What can I say? 
 It's true. 
 Uh-huh. 
 At least you admit it. 
 What's also true is that, over the years, I came to regard you in some ways as a son. 
 Ah, come on. 
 You don't have to believe me. 
 You have every right to be angry. 
 But now you got to put that aside. 
 A lot of people are going to die, Joe. 
 More than you can possibly imagine. 
 People who we love. 
 Rita, Buddy... 
 Helen, the kids. 
 What makes you think... 
 Juliana Crain. 
 What? 
 She's been living in New York, Joe... under my protection. 
 No, no. 
 No, I know that's a lie. 
 My family sponsored her citizenship. 
 You can check it with one call. 
 She was in the Resistance. 
 You would have never have granted that. 
 When I saw how important she was, I kept her alive. 
 You manipulative son of a bitch. 
 Obergruppenführer Smith, I have an order for your arrest. 
 Joe : No, hold on. 
 The Obergruppenführer is here with critical intelligence that the acting chancellor needs to hear. 
 I have my orders. 
 And I'm countermanding them on my authority. 
 Josef, what is this? 
 Something you must see. 
 What? 
 Enemy intelligence. 
 It'll take ten minutes of your time, but it will change everything. 
 Smith : What you're seeing, gentlemen, is a new type of atomic device called a hydrogen bomb... with a magnitude a thousand times more powerful than anything in our arsenal. 
 The site of the test is the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, deep inside the territory of the Japanese Empire. 
 [projector off] 
 When was this test conducted? 
 It's hard to say. 
 Possibly years ago. 
 [speaking German] 
 Reichsführer. 
 There's one more thing you need to see. 
 This is backed up by extensive audio recordings, but I think you'll find it gets to the heart of the matter. 
 You may be surprised to hear this, Reichsführer, but until two days ago, Obergruppenführer Heydrich was alive and in my custody. 
 Under interrogation, he revealed a conspiracy... a very large, far-reaching conspiracy. 
 The Führer was not assassinated by Japanese agents, sir. 
 He was poisoned by the same conspirator who was behind the shooting of the Crown Prince of Japan, the same conspirator who, even now, is plotting to provoke a war against Japan. 
 One that will consolidate his power. 
 Just think of the innocent lives. 
 Come with me. 
 Father, you can't. 
 I know the casualties will be high, but that may be necessary. 
 You can't really believe that. 
 Did you listen to nothing that I've said? 
 Of course I did, but you can't build a better world if there's nothing left of it. 
 [speaking German] 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Your father's a traitor, Joe. 
 You son of a bitch! 
 Well done. 
 Obergruppenführer, follow me. 
 [speaking German] 
 [crowd shouting] 
 Der Rädelsführer... 
 Translator : The Ringleader... of these traitors... 
 Martin Heusmann... attempted to deceive you. 
 It's father. 
 Shh. 
 The Reich thanks you. 
 The Reich salutes you. 
 [crowd cheering] 
 Sieg... 
 Crowd : Heil! 
 Sieg... 
 Heil! 
 Sieg... 
 Heil! 
 Sieg... 
 Heil! 
 Sieg... 
 Heil! 
 Sieg... 
 Heil! 
 Sieg...

 This is where you get out. 
 Sorry? 
 It's as far as you go. 
 All right. Thank you. 
 Man on radio : ...and the Reich forces would immediately stand down. 
 At the 11th hour, war was averted by the shock revelation that Chancellor Heusmann had fabricated evidence against the Japanese. 
 The brave sons of the Reich who had been deployed to the front lines, were stunned to learn that Chancellor Heusmann's betrayal was exposed by one of our own leaders... the GNR's Head of Intelligence, Obergruppenführer Smith. 
 In a historic moment, viewed by tens of millions, Obergruppenführer became the first American to receive the Iron Guard salute in Berlin. 
 Oh, sure. Dad's on TV, and now you're gonna act all grown up? 
 Reichsführer Himmler welcomes a new era of peace between a world... 
 I love you, Jennifer. 
 Later in this program, we will bring you information... 
 Mom. 
 Hmm? 
 There's something wrong with Thomas. 
 What is this? 
 May I have a moment, please? 
 Thomas. 
 Look, I won't tell them about what you and Father said. 
 Be proud of me. 
 Tell Father to be proud. 
 No. Thom... Thomas. 
 [echoing] Thomas, stay with me! 
 Stay with me, Thomas! 
 Thomas! 
 [shouting, sobbing] 
 Thomas! 
 Thomas, don't go! 
 Thomas! 
 Thomas! 
 [shouting] 
 Thomas! 
 Hello, Juliana. 
 You knew. 
 You knew what would happen. 
 You showed me that film, and you knew. 
 You knew I'd come here and I'd killed him. 
 You think I wanted to hurt you? 
 [chuckling] No. No! 
 No, the only thing I knew was that you, Juliana Crain, were the only hope any of us had. 
 You asked me if you were in the films. 
 You are, you were, over and over again. 
 Sometimes... 
 I'd see you in the background somewhere... a protest, a speech, a war zone, maybe. 
 Some place that mattered. 
 I started knowing where to look. 
 You could never stay out of it. 
 Some of the people you knew... 
 I started seeing them, too, revolving around you like an atom. But... they would change... different behavior, different relationships, different points of view shaped by their lives. 
 But you were always you. 
 You and your unnatural consistent mind. 
 What if you haven't seen this film? 
 Well, I got to know a woman who would bet on the best in us, who bet on people, no matter what the world said about who they were, who they should be. 
 That woman would do anything to save a sick boy... a Nazi boy, even... because she would believe he deserved the chance, as slim as it might be, to live a valuable life. 
 And I knew that was the key, the only way to make sure that your sister's father wouldn't prevent that boy's father from stopping a war. 
 Dixon died in an alley so that son of a bitch Smith could live up. 
 [chuckling] 
 San Francisco is still here. 
 Millions of people will live because of the choice you made, the goodness in you, Juliana. 
 One selfless act of love and hope. 
 That's what I put my money on. 
 I have no one left and nothing left! 
 There's no way out! 
 You're wrong. 
 You're wrong. 
 Trust me. 
 Come with me. 
 Hey, sis. 
 [raining] 
 [thunder] 
 [knock on door] 
 Kono. 
 [knocking] 
 Kono. 
 Mr. Tagomi? 
 I'm a friend of Juliana Crain.
