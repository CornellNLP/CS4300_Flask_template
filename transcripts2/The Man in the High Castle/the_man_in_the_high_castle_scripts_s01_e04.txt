 [rifle cocked] 
 There's no point in hiding, missy. 
 I'm going to find you. 
 f*ck! 
 Uhh! 
 Let's go. 
 Where's the truck? 
 I don't know. Come on. 
 Damn, I left my gun in the truck. 
 Which way? 
 Where'd they go? 
 What's he doing? 
 I think he's helping us. 
 I moved it around back. 
 Why are you helping us? 
 Because he's a f*cking maniac. 
 Why else do you think? 
 You better get out of here before he comes back. 
 We're going, but we need to talk to somebody first. 
 Lemuel Washington. 
 The diner's closed. 
 Yeah, I see that. You know where he lives?

 [gunshots] 
 [knock on door] 
 [pounding] 
 [pounding] 
 We got to talk, Frank. 
 I got nothing to say. 
 How about you tell me what you're doing with a gun? 
 Shh! Keep your damn voice down. 
 It's for protection. 
 Protection? 
 Do you blame me? 
 After what happened? 
 Do you know what the Pons will do if they catch you with a gun? 
 I got to do something, Ed. Do you get that? 
 I can't just do nothing. 
 Buddy, there's nothing you can do, except you take it. 
 You take it, or you get yourself killed. 
 Frank. 
 What? 
 You're not going to do something stupid, are you? 
 No. 
 Then what? 
 What is it? Is it revenge? 
 Are you going to take a shot at that cop that killed Laura and her kids? 
 I'm tired, okay? I'm really tired. 
 I don't... 
 Go home. Just go home. Come on. 
 Out. Come on. Get out of here. 
 Ed, leave. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 You're not going to take a shot... 
 Are you crazy? 
 Just f*cking leave! 
 The prince had nothing to do with what happened to Laura. 
 You kill a cop, and a thousand cops will take his place. 
 You kill that prince, their god, you drive a stake right through their f*cking hearts. 
 You do that, and your life is over. 
 It's already over. 
 What about Juliana? 
 Juliana? 
 She... 
 She's left me, okay? She's gone. 
 No, Frank. That's not true. 
 Jules loves you, and you know that. 
 Now, no matter what's happened, she's going to come back here, and she's going to be here for you, just like you were there for her when she needed you. 
 No. 
 Frank, please. 
 Don't give up. 
 Buddy, please promise me that you won't give up. 
 Please promise me. 
 All right. All right. 
 I'll get rid of the gun. 
 I don't know where I was going to find bullets for it anyway. 
 Okay, good. Why don't you give it to me? I'll do it. 
 No. No, no. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 I promise. 
 Okay. 
 Hi. I like your doll. 
 What's her name? 
 Annie. 
 Annie. That's my mother's name. 
 You kids come on inside. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 We need to speak to you. 
 How do you know where I live? 
 We came to warn you. 
 Warn me about what? 
 We found your name on a list, right below my sister's. 
 This m*therf*cker stays by the truck. 
 You come inside. 
 Hey, hold on a second. 
 It's okay. 
 Hey, honey, take the kids upstairs. 
 It's okay. 
 Sit down. 
 Your sister's name is Trudy Walker? 
 She was supposed to bring you the film. 
 They shot her, and I took her place. 
 What is your name? 
 Juliana. 
 Juliana Crain. 
 We were half-sisters. 
 Then you saw my name on what, some kind of list? 
 There was a man at the diner, the one who made paper animals. 
 And, uh, when no one else approached me, I thought he was my contact. 
 He tried to kill me. 
 It went the other way. 
 Where's the body? 
 In the river. 
 We sunk it. 
 You and him? 
 Look, we found a woman that this man had tortured. 
 You knew her? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Her name was Linda. 
 She disappeared a few days ago. 
 Well, she must have given him the list of names. 
 They were all crossed off except for my sister's and yours. 
 We're dead. 
 Maybe not. 
 Nobody's seen the list except for us. 
 You were my sister's contact, Lem, and you didn't tell me. 
 I didn't trust you. 
 I sure as hell don't trust him. 
 Have you seen the films? 
 It's not my job to see them. 
 I just pass them along. 
 Then you don't know what they mean. 
 I just know they help kill Nazis. 
 Now you give me that goddamn film. 
 And you get the hell out of my house. 
 I'm not giving you the film, not anymore. 
 I'll give it to the man you give it to. 
 That ain't how it works. 
 Look, I'm not here to kill Nazis. 
 I'm here because I need answers, and I'm not leaving until I get them. 
 Who is it, Lem? 
 Who is it you give the films to? 
 Well? 
 Tomorrow morning, Spirit Alley Trail. 
 What's there? 
 He's going to take me to meet the man he's supposed to give my film to. 
 Who's that? 
 The Man in the High Castle. 
 [ring] 
 [ring] 
 [groan] 
 [ring] 
 Hello. 
 Joe : It's me, Obergruppenführer. 
 Joe. It's two hours... 
 I know, sir. 
 But I've made contact with the Resistance operative. 
 John. 
 You hold on, Joe. 
 Smith : Okay, Helen. 
 [click] 
 So this contact, did he ask for the film? 
 No, I told him I'd only give it to his superior. 
 I suppose you got a name. 
 He said it's the Man in the High Castle. 
 The Man in the High Castle? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I want you to proceed with great caution, Joe. 
 These are very dangerous men you're dealing with. 
 I understand. 
 No. You think you understand. 
 I know you're very motivated, Joe, but you're young. you suffer from the arrogance of ignorance. 
 Yes, sir. 
 So what are my orders, sir? 
 If I do meet the Man In the High Castle, do I give him the film? 
 No. 
 You leave the film in the truck. 
 This is going to be very hard for you to hear, Joe, but if you are taken to the Man In the High Castle, I want you to put a bullet in his head... even if it costs you your life. 
 Are you prepared to do that, Joe? 
 Yes... 
 Obergruppenführer. 
 When's this meeting due to happen? 
 Tomorrow morning. 
 Then I'll await your call. 
 If I don't hear from you, Joe... no matter what happened... you'll receive a hero's funeral... with full honors. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Heil Hitler. 
 Heil Hitler. 
 I need your guidance, Tagomi-San. 
 My husband is troubled. 
 He fears our grip on the Empire is loosening. 
 I have heard these fears expressed by others, Your Highness. 
 Of course. 
 You speak to people from many nations in your work, but do you feel that that fear is valid? 
 One thing is certain: the Nazis covet our territories, none more so than the Pacific States. 
 If they perceive weakness, they will strike. 
 The generals wish my husband to make a war cry to frighten the Nazis so they back down. 
 But he... he believes such threats are hollow, that we must seek for peace. 
 It will be seen as weakness, but the Prince is not weak. 
 Peace is not weakness. 
 Forces may yet emerge that will allow him to move toward peace with strength. 
 What forces? 
 I hope you're right, Tagomi-San. 
 But I fear these forces will arrive too late. 
 Marshal : Closing kind of early, aren't you? 
 One of my boys has a fever. 
 I'm going home to check on him. 
 Any sign of that waitress? 
 Nope. 
 And if I said that you were a f*cking liar? 
 You can kill me any time, Marshal. 
 That doesn't change my answer. 
 You're not afraid to die, are you, Mr. Washington? 
 Sure, I am. 
 Better take care of those strays of yours. 
 There's not a lot of doctors around here, and kids, they can die of anything. 
 You got the film? 
 [film can clanks] 
 Yeah. 
 I can do this on my own. 
 I can't let you go alone. I'm going with you. 
 Let's go. 
 [knock on door] 
 Mr. Tagomi. I... 
 I wasn't expecting you until later. 
 It was urgent I speak to you. 
 I brought some... 
 She's just leaving. 
 You shouldn't have taken such a risk. 
 She could be working for the Kempeitai. 
 No Japanese spy would do the things that woman did. 
 You cope with stress by throwing sticks, Mr. Tagomi. 
 I avail myself a more earthly means. 
 The Imperial Guard has approved the seating for the speech. 
 I have you sitting next to the Science Minister. 
 Place the envelope in his coat pocket while the Prince is speaking. 
 After the address, you'll never have access to him again. 
 Joe : How much farther? 
 Lemuel : Not that far. 
 Juliana : Can you explain something to me? 
 You've never seen a film. 
 You're risking your life for them, your family's lives. 
 Why? 
 I do my part. That's all. 
 And you have no idea how he makes them? 
 Who? 
 The Man In the High Castle. 
 He doesn't make them, does he? 
 You don't think we'd waste all this time collecting his films to give them back to him, do you? 
 So why does he want them? And where do they come from? 
 We're here. 
 Where is he? 
 He's not coming. 
 [rifle cocked] 
 What is this, Lem? 
 Give me the film. 
 Get on your knees. 
 Are you going to shoot us, Lem? 
 I wouldn't have if you hadn't brought this goose-stepping m*therf*cker along with you. 
 The cell he was from in New York was hit by the S.S., just as he got in his goddamn truck. 
 What c-cell? What cell? 
 I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't. 
 I'm with the Resistance. 
 Bullshit. 
 He's the only one who got out of that shop, which means either the Nazis got sloppy, which they do not do, or they wanted him to escape because he's one of them. 
 It's real. 
 Joe : Believe me now? 
 He helped me. 
 He tried to warn you about your name on that list. 
 He used you. 
 He used you to get to the Man In the High Castle. 
 Why else would he be here? 
 Okay. 
 I'm a Nazi... then why do I bring this? 
 [rifle cocks] 
 Film's good. 
 If you make it back to town, the Marshal will kill you. 
 So where do we go? 
 Cripple Creek. 
 It's the other side of that mountain. 
 That's impossible. 
 We can never make that climb. 
 You have to help us, Lem. 
 I can't. I'm sorry. 
 [speaking Japanese] 
 [footsteps] 
 
 
 
 You're not fooling anybody. 
 I know you watch those Japanese shows. 
 If you've come home for lunch, you're out of luck. 
 I haven't gone to the market yet. 
 I talked to Bob Perloff. 
 He has Frank's sister on his mail route. 
 Annie, I've got some bad news. 
 Good afternoon. May I help you? 
 I hope so. 
 I'm looking for a rather unusual item. 
 Well, you've come to the right place. 
 American Artistic Handcrafts is a veritable cornucopia of the recherché. 
 What did you have in mind? 
 Antique bullets. 
 The kind that fit the old Colt .45. 
 Sir, even if I had such an item, I'm sure you're aware that the sales of ammunition are restricted and strictly illegal to sell to non-Japanese. 
 Yes. Yeah. Look, I was hoping you might make an exception for a highly motivated buyer. 
 [door opens, bell tinkles] 
 Pardon me. 
 [speaking Japanese] 
 We have passed by your store many times and always meant to come in. 
 I am most honored by your splendid presence. 
 Man : You have such fine pieces. 
 This mirror, it dates back to the American War of 1812, I would guess. 
 You have a keen eye. 
 What a pleasure it is to speak with someone who has an appreciation for American traditional ethnic art. 
 I'm afraid I spend my morning trying to educate a gaggle of white-sock yokels in from the sticks. 
 Excuse me. 
 Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry to interrupt, but we were in the middle of a transaction. 
 Perhaps we will come back another time. 
 Oh, please, that's not... 
 Uh, I will be waiting. 
 Close the doors. 
 Only three? 
 This is an antique store, not an armory, and I can't guarantee they'll fire. 
 They're 100 yen apiece. 
 300. 
 What is that? 
 I'm required by law to keep a registry of all sales of restricted items. 
 So these bullets were purchased by Mr. Satoshi Matsuda, a collector on his way back to Tibet. 
 But I will need to see your identity card on the chance I need to revisit this matter with you, and that is non-negotiable. 
 All right, all right. 
 Come on. 
 I suggest you work on your patience, Mr. Frink. 
 Hello? 
 Frank? 
 [gasp] 
 Jesus. Anne. 
 Did I scare you? I'm sorry. 
 No, it's okay, it's okay. 
 Nobody answered, so I just used my key. 
 Where's Juliana? 
 Uh, at the dojo, I think. 
 You think she could spend a little less time flippin' Japs and a little more time doing housework. 
 This place is a mess. 
 Frank, what happened to your face? 
 Uh, it was an accident at work. 
 It's nothing. 
 I heard about Laura and the kids. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Who told you? 
 Arnold heard it. 
 It's just awful. 
 That cut. 
 Frank, they haven't bothered you, have they? 
 No, no. I'm fine. 
 I have work to do. 
 No. 
 You're awfully good. 
 At what? 
 Lying. 
 Yeah, well... 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Because I have orders. 
 Orders. 
 We're on the same side, and your orders say you can't tell me. 
 [sigh] 
 What's it like? 
 What's what like? 
 The Resistance. 
 Not the best man to ask. 
 It's my first mission. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm not off to a good start. 
 You got the film where it was supposed to go, didn't you? 
 Eventually, I guess. 
 What did you think of it? 
 I didn't watch it. 
 Come on, Joe. 
 You're not supposed to. 
 It's not like I have a projector in the truck anyway. 
 You weren't even tempted to hold it up to the light or something? 
 No. 
 Ahem. 
 What is it, Captain? 
 We've completed our review of the phone records of the six officers outside yourself who had access to your travel routes and to the routes of Hauptsturmführer Lautz. 
 And? 
 Sir, there's absolutely no evidence of a security breach of any kind. 
 And yet we know there was a security breach? 
 Yes, sir. 
 So what you're telling me, Captain Connolly, is that you've failed. 
 Sir... 
 You're not allowed to fail, Captain. 
 Do you understand me? 
 Not when it involves a coordinated attack on the high command. 
 The Semite I brought in, the one who shot at me, did you manage to locate any members of his family? 
 Yes. Yes, we did. 
 He has two brothers, one in the Neutral Zone and another in the Pacific States. 
 Well, let's pay him a little visit, shall we? 
 Why was a prisoner on suicide watch given a spoon? 
 He wasn't. 
 It wasn't on the tray when I brought it. 
 It... It couldn't have been. I... I would have seen it. 
 Place this man under arrest. 
 Joe : We'll never make it over those mountains. 
 Even if we do, The Marshal will probably be waiting on the other side. 
 Why do you do it, Joe? 
 That is your name, isn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 It is. 
 A guy like you must have it made in the Reich. 
 Why risk it all for a film you haven't even seen? 
 Is it for him? 
 For your dad? 
 All right, what do we do? 
 If I can get the origami man's car, maybe I can draw the bounty hunter out of town. 
 That way, we can get you on the bus, get you back home. 
 No, he'd catch you. 
 No, he won't, not the way I drive. 
 He doesn't even want you. 
 I'm the one who killed that man. 
 Hey, I'm just as much involved as you are. 
 San Francisco is buzzing with excitement this morning about the Crown Prince's speech that will take place later today at the Nazi Embassy. 
 It's truly an historic event: the descendant of the Sun Goddess, our glorious Crown Prince, addressing us in person... 
 [knock on door] 
 ...in our own city, and from all indications, they're expecting a record turnout. 
 There are reports that excited citizens are traveling into San Francisco by the thousands... 
 Going somewhere? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Do you think I'm an idiot? Give it to me, Frank. 
 I am leaving, Ed, and you're not going to stop me. 
 Not till you give me that gun. 
 Oh, yeah? Or what? 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 We're going to sit right here, just you and me, until the Crown Prince's speech is over. 
 Come on, Ed. You're not going to shoot me. 
 [click] 
 Oh, no? You don't think I would shoot you to keep you from killing somebody else? 
 From killing yourself? 
 Because that's what you'd be doing, Frank. 
 Aah! 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 Oh, God damn it! 
 Oh, Frank, I'm sorry! I shot you. 
 You wasted one of my bullets. 
 You're bleeding. 
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, Frank. 
 Just give me the first aid kit out of the closet. 
 Frank! 
 What are you doing? 
 [thumping] Let me out! 
 Don't do this, Frank! 
 Oh, no. 
 Frank, please! Don't! 
 [thumping] 
 Don't do this! 
 Let me out! 
 [thumping] Frank! 
 It's weird. 
 You're white, which is a good thing, real good. 
 But you're too white, which makes you a freak. 
 It's like too much of a good thing. 
 You're done. 
 [engine stalls] 
 You're flooding it! 
 Take your foot off the gas! 
 [engine starts] 
 Leave her the f*ck alone. 
 I'd be worried about myself if I were you. 
 Pull that trigger, and you'll be killing a Nazi agent. 
 What? 
 I'm working that girl. I need her alive. 
 Why the f*ck should I believe that? 
 Because I report directly to Obergruppenführer Smith in New York. 
 Why don't you give him a call? 
 I'll do that once I'm through talking to the girl. 
 You stay out of my way or I'll kill you.

 [security radio chatter] 
 [chatter in Japanese] 
 Yes, sir. Passport. 
 That bus should be here any minute. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm not getting on it. 
 [sigh] I can't go back without answers. 
 Juliana, the bounty hunter could come back at any second. 
 I know. 
 Look, I got to make a phone call. 
 Juliana. 
 I'm going to check and make sure we didn't leave any evidence behind. 
 Gentlemen, I have been informed that the Crown Prince and Princess will be arriving shortly. Please take your seats. 
 Ah, Mr. Shimura. 
 A man of your stature should not be so far in the back. 
 Thank you, Oberführer. I am quite content. 
 I won't hear of it. Come. Please come. 
 Here. Right here. Sit. 
 Excuse me. 
 Sorry. 
 Thanks. 
 I'm sorry.

 And people of the American Territories, or, as they like to say here... 
 Howdy.

 [speaking Japanese] 
 Translator : All those who fought in the Great War believed they fought on the side of righteousness, that the world they sought to build would be a better one. 
 [speaking Japanese] 
 But men are mortal and imperfect. 
 They see the world as they wish to see it, through the looking glass of their limited perspective.
