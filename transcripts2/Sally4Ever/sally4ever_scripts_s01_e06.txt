  Okay, guys. 
  So, unfortunately, there's a bit of a cock-up with the rooms. 
  Um, we've got a situ where, uh, somebody's gonna have to share. 
  Well, I'd be willing to share, but I have to have my own room with specialist facilities. 
  Yes, the hotel got your rider. 
  What about Nigel and Sally? 
  They could share. 
  - DEBORAH: No, no, no. 
  - I don't mind sharing with Mick. 
  Mick will keep you up with his night terrors. 
  I don't get night terrors. 
  Who told you that? 
  Well, your mum. 
  Gosh, so I suspect it falls to you and me, I'm afraid, Sal, to, uh, hole up together. 
  - Well, there aren't any other rooms at all? 
  - No. 
  Nothing. 
  'Cause I don't mind getting a really small room. 
  - No. 
  Fully booked. 
  - Or by the lifts. 
  I don't mind the noise. 
  Packed to the hilt, I'm afraid. 
  If there's a room by the boiler, or by the generator, or - In a cupboard, or something. 
  - Nothing at all. 
  We'll have fun, though, be like a girly time. 
  - SALLY: Hey.

  Sorry. 
  DEBORAH: Okay. 
  Next up is the donut game. 
  One dangles, one kneels. 
  It's just a fun game. 
  Okay, Nigel? 
  (WHEELCHAIR WHIRRING) 
  Do you mind if I don't go with Nigel, please, Deborah? 
  There's quite a lot of sexual tension between us. 
  Well, I never said you should go with Nigel, so Sally, you're the dangler. 
  Nigel, you're the gobbler. 
  (POP MUSIC PLAYING) 
  - Hold in there? 
  - What? 
  Should I hold it there? 
  I don't care. 
  Do what you want. 
  - SALLY: What? 
  - What? 
  Can I grab your thighs? 
  I need to get a grip. 
  SALLY: You've gotta Just keep it still. 
  You've been eating my fish paste sandwiches. 
  I don't think that's very nice, Mick. 
  It's just a bit of banter. 
  Don't worry about it. 
  Anyway, I like big, old whiffy ones. 
  That is very offensive. 
  I could hash "me too" about that. 
  You're probably smelling your own genitals. 
  BELINDA: Is Sally Is she joining us? 
  Oh, she's not um, she's not coming today. 
  I just thought we could maybe have a sort of a one-on-one session, - if that was okay? 
  - Right. 
  Just to keep me topped up. 
  How are you feeling? 
  How are the wounds? 
  I'm getting some of the feeling back in my middle fingers. 
  Right. 
  Right. 
  So you're a tough old cookie. 
  Yeah, tough old bird. 
  Yeah, I think it's just working through - my fears around Sally's mental illness. 
  - Sure. 
  And that's something that's been now confirmed, has it? 
  I know you've felt that she's, uh, got a lot of issues. 
  - I had a lot of concerns. 
  - Yeah. 
  And I just think, funny how I'm the one that ends up cutting my wrists. 
  So tell me a bit more about Emma. 
  How's Emma feeling? 
  - She's good. 
  She's good, she's - Okay. 
  Um, I'm gonna talk about her as myself. 
  - Okay. 
  Fine. 
  - Because, you know But I still have the multiple personality thing - that I kind of sometimes go into, but. 
  - Sure. 
  I've done a couple of new songs, and I've done Um, talking through the experience of suicide, and - you know, coming out the other side. 
  - Right. 
  'Cause there's that "MASH. 
  " - Mash-up. 
  - The theme to No, the mash-up. 
  - Oh, the mash-ups. 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  "The MASH" Through early morning Fog I see Visions of the to be Pain (BOTH MURMUR TUNE TO "SUICIDE IS PAINLESS") 
  I realize and I can see (BOTH HIT HIGH NOTE OUT OF TUNE) 
  - But it's not that. 
  - No. 
  So tell me a little bit more about Sally. 
  What did Sally and Nigel get up to in that bedroom? 
  I like to believe that Sally didn't really enjoy it. 
  Okay. 
  And what do you really believe? 
  - I think she really enjoyed it. 
  - Okay. 
  Chances are I think that's probably the case. 
  Do you think Nigel really enjoyed it? 
  I think he probably did. 
  And I've had fantasies about having him - For yourself? 
  - Removed. 
  Oh. 
  Oh, I see. 
  Sort of murderous thoughts. 
  I thought for a moment you went into a realm where you made love with Nigel. 
  No, no. 
  Thoughts of, you know, axing him to death. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Or throwing darts at his face. 
  Okay. 
  What else? 
  Um, taping him up and putting him in the boot of a car. 
  - Right. 
  - Dropping him in a lake. 
  - Sure. 
  - Um Okay. 
  So that's pretty mild, really, as a reaction. 
  You're somebody whose lover love of your life has essentially stripped naked on a bed with somebody you don't know very well. 
  That somebody has an engorged organ. 
  That engorged organ has penetrated your love of your life. 
  He's taken something away from you. 
  - I imagine all of these are your thoughts. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  You know, who came first? 
  - Did they come more than once? 
  - They came together. 
  - Did they come together? 
  - They came together. 
  How did that happen mechanically? 
  What angle was the pen1s going into the v*g1n* for that to actually occur? 
  It's a relatively rare occurrence, of course. 
  BOTH: Um Do you think I'm doing the right thing, to marry her? 
  Yeah, I think it's what she wants and what you want. 
  I'm not certain it's what she wants. 
  - Or consciously what she wants. 
  - And why do you think that? 
  - 'Cause she says she doesn't. 
  - But apart from that. 
  No reason. 
  Francesca. 
  Lovely name.

  Mmm. 
  You look, uh you look foreign.

  I don't I don't think I need a bath, really.

  Yeah, it's um. 
  From behind, it looks like you're not wearing anything. 
  Yeah. 
  That's the idea. 
  Hmm. 
  I wonder sometimes how hygienic they are. 
  Well, I keep myself fully waxed, you know, from front to back, so that any sweat just trickles out. 
  It doesn't gather and create all that stinky hair business. 
  Do you know what I mean? 
  Hey, can I have a swig of that just to take these tablets, please? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, yeah.

  Should I, should I? 
  I'll call her back.

  She's just insecure, I think. 
  I think she might be a bit uncomfortable about Well, the chemistry between us, isn't it.

  Yeah, that. 
  But I just I don't think it would be fair It wouldn't be appropriate, really, to-to - But the thing is - to let this You know, you can't really deny when there's a fire between two people.
