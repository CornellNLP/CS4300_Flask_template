 DEBORAH: Right, okay. So, as you know,    
 Krebel Farms have asked us to put the sexy back into, um, eggs...    
 - (MAN WHISTLES) 
- (LAUGHTER)    
 ... for their relaunch as a teen brand.    
 So, Nigel, how are you and...    
 - (WHISPERS): Sorry. 
- DEBORAH: Well, there she is.    
 DEBORAH: Come on in. Do join us.    
 So how are you two getting on with the, uh, work you've been doing?    
 NIGEL: Good, yeah.    
 We're, uh, working on, um, egg DJs.    
 DJing eggs.    
 Omelet... omelet decks.    
 Sally did some pretty fun mock-ups of, of the DJ.    
 DEBORAH: All right, let's see those, then.    
 I didn't... I didn't bring the drawings today.    
 Um... sorry.    
 - I can bring them next time. 
- Well, there isn't a next time, Sally.    
 This is the meeting to do with this, so...    
 Any other ideas?    
 I have a boiled egg every morning, and I'm convinced they make your boobs grow.    
 Mine just get bigger and bigger. (CHUCKLES)    
 DEBORAH: Right.    
 DEBORAH: Market research does show that we do need to address what people don't like about eggs    
 - as much as what they do. 
- MICK: Definitely. Exactly.    
 Yeah, um... you're right.     
 I mean, I... I really worry about the little brown bits you find in the yolk.     
 I don't know, um...     
 - Is that a tiny stool? 
- Stool?     
 No, no, no. It's not a stool.     
 It's a bit of fetus, half-formed.     
 Maybe that's how we should pitch the campaign, you know.     
 Can you face the horror within the shell?     
 Well, we could, but, right now, I'm wondering whether perhaps it'd be better if we just disguised the eggshells, altogether.     
 Eggs in bras.     
 That was one idea we were thinking of.     
 Egg lingerie.     
 - Right, eggs in bras. 
- A way of presenting the eggs in a fun, sexy, provocative way.     
 You could too, I mean, we could bring in your theme there     
 'cause young girls do want to have a chest, don't they, as they grow?     
 So, you could have a... eggs in trainer bras, maybe, would be better?     
 Fried eggs?     
 You know, like little girls have.     
 Not, not the big 'uns, like she's got.     
 Well, I had a full chest by the age of ten.     
 Yeah, I... I was eight.     
 DEBORAH: Oh. Sally?     
 Um...     
 One got big at nine.     
 Um, the other one...     
 (LAUGHS) Twelve? I don't, I don't know.     
 DEBORAH: No, I meant, did you have any more ideas?     
 Sorry about earlier.     
 No, it's fine. What happened?     
 I just forgot everything.     
 Left all my stuff on the tube.     
 - On the tube? 
- Mm.     
 What's that smell?     
 That's probably my massive ball bag.     
 Hey. I think she fancies me.     
 - Sally? 
- You know how she's all, like,     
 - gets flustered about me... 
- Mm.     
 - ... and like walks off? 
- Yeah.     
 Well, that's classic pheromone stuff, isn't it?     
 I thought pheromones were supposed to draw the opposite s*x towards you.     
 No, no. It repels them because I'm so powerful. She's gets...     
 - Overwhelmed? Has to go and lie down? 
- Yeah.     
 So, I was thinking I'll probably make a move     
 - if that's all right with you. 
- Yeah, fine. Why wouldn't it be? Go for it.     
 Well, you might be looking for a rebound shag.     
 No. No, that's all...     
 - I've shut up shop in that department. 
- Yeah?     
 (CHUCKLES) Yeah.     
 Hi. Do you mind if I... ?     
 Oh, no.     
 Just labeling my dairy products.     
 I have brittle bones.     
 Oh, okay.     
 Well, my legs are useless, but... it's good to keep the bones present.     
 Thirsty bones.     
 Right, yeah.     
 I just wanted to say     
 I know we're both going for the promotion, but...     
 Well, I...     
 I hope we can be friends?     
 Yeah, of course. I'd like that.     
 I don't want people thinking just because I'm in the chair that...     
 you know, that I've got...     
 you know, an unfair advantage over you.     
 No, no, not at all.     
 I mean, I didn't notice the chair.     
 I was run over.     
 I'm... I'm sorry.     
 By my mum.     
 God, that's awful.     
 Was it, um, recently?     
 Uh, no. I was, um...     
 quite young.     
 She, um, reversed over me and then...     
 back again.     
 She said she thought it was a large dog.     
 But I think she knew.     
 Hmm.

 I just said I couldn't feel anything.

 What was on the dress?     
 Oh, just... stains.

 I bet it fits.

 - I'm just feeling really weird. 
- Please, you're so wet.     
 - Please. 
- I'm engaged.     
 - Please. 
- Please, can we just be friends?     
 I can't be friends with you.     
 So that's it, then?     
 That's it.

 SALLY:  I'm so sorry. I'm just... I'm so confused.   
 You're not breaking up?     
 I don't know.     
 Sally, we're getting married.     
 I got my hat this morning from Amazon.     
 I'm so sorry.     
 Do you still love me?     
 'Course I still love you.     
 I'm just not attracted to you anymore.     
 Since when?     
 Maybe the last...     
 seven years.     
 It's like, with you, I just felt like I had no libido.     
 But with this woman... it's like she understands my body.     
 You... you... you've done stuff?     
 Oh, just... bits and bobs.
