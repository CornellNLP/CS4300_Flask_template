 Previously on "God Friended Me"  
 Someone calling themselves God on Facebook starting sending me Friend Suggestions for people in need of help. 
  - I'm only human  
  - [GASPS] 
  What the hell? 
  After all, don't put the blame on I know how to find people. 
  What happened with Eli? 
  He wasn't the one. 
  [UPBEAT MUSIC] 
  We want you to come to Paris with us, and we want you to write a book about it. 
  Cara, what I'm trying to say is Please don't say it. 
  I won't be able to get on that plane. 
  Miles Finer? 
  Yesterday, I got a friend request from someone calling themselves God on Facebook and they sent me your name. 
  Life in the Big Apple can be hard sometimes. 
  It's easy to feel alone, like you're out there fending for yourself. 
  But one man's got your back, making a difference one person at a time with an assist from a mysterious Facebook account. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "The Block. 
  " The host of FreeVerse's number one new podcast "The Millennial Prophet" himself, Miles Finer. 
  What up, what up? 
  Thank you for having me on your show. 
  Here's what I wanna know. 
  When are we getting more, huh? 
  It's been a month since your last podcast. 
  When is season two going to drop? 
  Very soon, and let me tell you, things have gotten interesting. 
  Oh, I can't wait to hear all about it. 
  But before we do, tell me what's going on with the rest of the God Account crew? 
  They're all doing great. 
  As you know, my dad retired from the church and got engaged. 
  Wedding's in six weeks. 
  My sister Ali is running point on that to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. 
  So? 
  I think we can make this work, hmm? 
  What do you think? 
  - Oh, hell, no, mm-mm. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  You are not wearing that. 
  My friend Rakesh, he is the head of R&D at IdentitySeal. 
  He's like a new man, I've never seen him work harder in his life. 
  Stop. 
  Little bit to the right. 
  Hair to the left. 
  Perfect. 
  And my girlfriend Cara is in Paris. 
  She's writing a book about Simon Hayes, Henry Chase, and Pria Amar, and they're working on an algorithm that's going to change the world. 
  Now, she's there for a few more months, but we talk all the time, and she has never been happier. 
  So, yeah, everyone is good. 
  I have no complaints. 
  There's only one thing left to talk about, the mystery that all your listeners are waiting to hear about God's new friend. 
  Oh, that. 
  Or as I like to call her, the lady in the red jacket. 
  Her name is Joy, and she has an amazing story. 
  Mm. 
  But if you want to hear more about that, you're gonna have to tune in to the second season! 
  Coming soon to FreeVerse. 
  [GROANS AND CHUCKLES] 
  You're killin' me. 
  Killin' me, man! 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Dude, this is a total disaster. 
  I told "The Block's" entire audience that I have an amazing new season planned around Joy, but the truth is, I have no idea where she is! 
  Well, Miles, you keep telling everyone at FreeVerse that season two of your podcast is gonna be awesome. 
  How 'bout just tell 'em the truth about what happened with Joy. 
  What, that I told her about the God Account and she took off? 
  Not to mention, FreeVerse wants a new episode by the end of the week, and other than there being no Joy, I haven't received a new Friend Suggestion since she showed up. 
  Okay, yup, fair point. 
  Have you done everything that you can to try to find her? 
  Yeah, but it's like she's a ghost. 
  Everything I could find we already know from her Facebook page. 
  She's from Chicago, she went to law school there. 
  She moved to New York six months ago. 
  [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC] 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I quit my job at IdentitySeal, Rakesh. 
  I bet everything on my podcast's success, but if there's no God Account, no Joy there's no podcast. 
  Okay, look, um I know how hard this is for you but I also know this is not just about the podcast. 
  You miss the God Account. 
  I just don't understand what I did wrong. 
  You didn't do anything wrong. 
  Matter of fact, you did everything right. 
  For whatever reason, the God Account moved on. 
  And maybe it's time you did the same and unfriend the God Account. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, that's really easy for you to say. 
  What does Cara think about all this? 
  She's in Paris, living her dream. 
  Don't want to bother her with this. 
  - [RELAXING MUSIC] 
  - [KNOCK AT DOOR] 
  [BREATHY VOCAL MUSIC] 
  Hi. 
  Hi. 
  - Can I come in? 
  - Yeah, sure. 
  So, Cara, you know, we've been working pretty closely together the last month and, uh, I don't know, the last couple weeks, you seem a little kinda off. 
  And I know you gave up a lot to come here and work for me, and I just want to make sure that you're not having, you know, second thoughts. 
  Thanks. 
  And I'm not. 
  - But? 
  - [SIGHS] 
  But. 
  If I'm being honest it feels like something's missing. 
  Hmm. 
  Miles? 
  God Account? 
  Both? 
  Yeah, I mean, I knew it would be hard coming here, but it's not just that. 
  What is it? 
  It's kind of a long story. 
  Okay. 
  [UPBEAT MUSIC] 
  But something you might be able to help me with, actually. 
  All right, then. 
  Well, why don't we talk about it over lunch? 
  All right. 
  - - [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC] 
  [LOW CHATTER OVER PA] 
  Excuse me, can you help me? 
  First time in New York, I'm not sure if I got off at the right stop. 
  I'm looking for Conway's Bar. 
  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know exactly where that is. 
  You wanna take the Second Avenue exit, make a left, two blocks over you can't miss it. 
  Thanks, appreciate it. 
  Oh, and by the way, welcome to New York. 
  Oh! 
  [RESONANT MUSIC] 
  Joy? 
  Joy! 
  Excuse me. 
  Joy! 
  Joy! 
  Joy? 
  [MUSIC FADES] 
  Oh, I am so sorry. 
  I-I thought you were someone else. 
  Joy. 
  [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC] 
  - You. 
  - Yeah. 
  We need to talk. 
  Okay, well, that was the last one. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - So, do we have a winner? 
  The hazelnut frosting on this one is divine. 
  This gets my vote. 
  - Arthur? 
  - I do love hazelnut. 
  - Yes! 
  - [CHUCKLING] 
  Good. 
  Now that that's settled, we have got to get moving, 'cause we're meeting that realtor in a half an hour to see the place on 131st Street. 
  You know, uh, shoot, um I forgot that was today. 
  I prised Irvin Carter that I would stop by the church to tie up some loose ends. 
  Would you mind seeing if we could reschedule next week? 
  Of course. 
  Oh, thank you. 
  [SMOOCHES] 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - And thank you. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  [PEACEFUL MUSIC] 
  Look, Miles, I can't deal with this right now. 
  I'm asking for five minutes, please. 
  Fine. 
  I'll give you two. 
  How'd you know I'd be here, anyway? 
  Actually, I didn't. 
  I think the God Account - had something to do with it. 
  - God Account. 
  You mean your friend the cyberterrorist? 
  The God Account is not a cyberterrorist. 
  Really? 
  'Cause ever since that day on the street, it won't leave me alone. 
  Wait, you've been getting Friend Suggestions? 
  No, not since it sent me your name. 
  What I meant is, it has completely hijacked my phone, my computer. 
  It keeps blasting the song "Human" in the middle of the night. 
  Look, I went through the same thing. 
  You should've come and talked to me. 
  Like I told you that day on the street, I don't want any part in this. 
  Anyway good talk. 
  I know how to make it stop. 
  [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC] 
  You have to help your Friend Suggestion. 
  I'm not the helping type, okay? 
  And besides, I already told you, I haven't gotten any since you. 
  [CELL PHONE BUZZES] 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  You gotta be kidding me. 
  - What? 
  - I just got a new Friend Suggestion. 
  For some solider in the Army. 
  This doesn't make any sense. 
  His Facebook page says he's stationed in Iraq. 
  Actually, he's in New York. 
  How do you know that? 
  Because I just gave him directions. 
  - Where's this bar again? 
  - It's just a few blocks down. 
  So how does this whole thing work? 
  Is the God Account going to tell us  
  - how to help this guy, or  
  - Oh, no, no, no. 
  Usually, we have to figure it out on our own. 
  Super. 
  So you really don't know how's pulling the strings? 
  I mean, I believe in God, but no way this is, you know, God. 
  Well, on that, we can agree, not the believing in God part. 
  Look, all I know is that these Friend Suggestions really need our help. 
  And hey, maybe your legal skills will come in handy. 
  What kind of lawyer are you, anyway? 
  The kind that no longer practices law. 
  What happened? 
  Do you always ask this many questions? 
  It's a force of habit, okay? 
  When helping people, digging into their stories is a good place to start. 
  I burned out. 
  Needed a change. 
  And New York? 
  Seemed as good a place as any to start over. 
  Got here a few months ago, took a job as a waitress so I can figure out my next step. 
  What about you? 
  You always this intent on helping people, or do you have other hobbies? 
  I host a podcast called "The Millennial Prophet. " Subtle. 
  - What's it about? 
  - The God Account. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Very meta. 
  Wait, have you talked about me on it? 
  Not really, I'm in between seasons. 
  I'm trying to figure out what my next storyline is gonna be. 
  So that's why you were looking for me. 
  You wanna know what my role is in all of this for your podcast. 
  Well, hate to break it to you, but I'm not gonna be some character on your show. 
  Look, I understand that you don't want anything to do with this, but right now,  
  - we both need each other. 
  - How so? 
  The God Account is all about tests, and I'm hoping that this is one of them, okay? 
  We help Lieutenant Freemont, I am betting that we'll both get our lives back. 
  Sound good? 
  Okay. 
  [UPBEAT PERCUSSIVE MUSIC] 
  Deux cafÃ©s ? 
  - TrÃ¨s bien, merci. 
  - Merci. 
  Beautiful view. 
  So, you said there was something I can help you with. 
  Yeah, yeah, there is. 
  Part of the reason I came here to study abroad five years ago was because I wanted to look up a friend of my mom's who I met when I was young. 
  She was living in Paris at the time and I thought she might know where my mom was. 
  She didn't, but we ended up getting really close and she's actually the whole reason I became a journalist, I wanted to follow in her footsteps. 
  That's not a bad origin story. 
  Actually, there's more. 
  So, a few months after I got home, I got this Facebook message from her saying that she heard my mom was in New York, so after I graduated that's where I went and eventually I met Miles who helped me reconnect with her and it was all because of this Facebook message Annie sent. 
  Wow, she must be, uh, very gratified to have played such an important role in your life. 
  Yeah, actually, she never knew. 
  We lost touch after I move to New York. 
  And when I reconnected with my mom, I tried to reach out to her but I couldn't track her down. 
  Hmm. 
  You have, uh, Rakesh look into it? 
  Yeah, but he's a little preoccupied. 
  Hey, look, I would love to help, but I'm not a hacker. 
  No, no, but you are a billionaire. 
  Even better. 
  Come on, Simon, you know people. 
  Uh, okay, look. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Why don't you tell me her name and I'll see what I can dig up. 
  Thank you. 
  Her name's Annie Keller. 
  All right. 
  Well, I'll let you know what I find out. 
  Hey, sweetheart. 
  I, uh, got your message. 
  Everything okay? 
  Yeah, I just I wanted to see how things went at the church. 
  Hmm? 
  You tie up all those loose ends you were telling Trish about? 
  Was it that obvious? 
  Not to Trish, but I have a 24-year head-start on decoding Arthur Finer. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Trish has her heart set on us finding a new place together. 
  To be honest, I'm struggling with the idea of selling my house, actually living somewhere else. 
  I know it probably sounds silly, but No. 
  It doesn't. 
  But I don't think avoiding the problem is the way to handle it. 
  No, you're right. 
  I need to tell her the truth. 
  [SUBDUED MUSIC] 
  I don't want to move. 
  Hey, make your mind up Should've thought about it before you signed up New lover, lot to climb up Too high There he is. 
  - [LOW CHATTER] 
  - Okay, what's the plan? 
  - How do we get this guy to talk? 
  - Uh [CHUCKLES] 
  We're just here to help him, he's not a witness. 
  Right, sorry. 
  Just follow my lead. 
  Never been my strong suit, but I will give it a shot. 
  Hey! 
  Lieutenant? 
  Hey, you're the guy from the subway. 
  Yeah, Miles Finer! 
  This is my, uh, friend, Joy. 
  - Hi. 
  - Nice to meet you. 
  Hi, Lieutenant James Freemont. 
  - This is Caffey. 
  - Hey, how's it goin'? 
  Miles, uh, gave me directions when I got turned around getting here. 
  Hey, can I buy you guys another round? 
  - Yeah, absolutely, man! 
  Pull up a seat. 
  - Yeah! 
  So, uh, you two serve together? 
  Yeah, two tours. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Until Caffey decided to trade it all in for a clipboard and a desk. 
  I work in the recruitment office in Times Square. 
  Okay, and what about you, Lieutenant? 
  How long have you been here? 
  I'm actually just finishing up my leave. 
  I ship back out tomorrow night. 
  So are you in town visiting family, or No, he doesn't know anyone here but me. 
  And for the record, I told him to go to Hawaii. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  - So why New York? 
  Ah, no reason, I just, uh, wanted to see the sights, you know, Times Square. 
  Can I ask you a question, Lieutenant? 
  Is there something we can help you with? 
  Help me with? 
  Yeah, do you have some sort of trouble or problem in your life that you think is insurmountable in some way? 
  [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC] 
  I'm I'm sorry, I [LAUGHS] 
  You know what? 
  I think it's about time for me to get those beers. 
  Uh, hey, Joy, you want to come with me? 
  You need help getting beers? 
  Yeah, come with me. 
  Now, please. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  What? 
  I mean, he's clearly lying about what he's doing here. 
  Why beat around the bush? 
  Either he has a problem we can help him with or he doesn't. 
  First, of course he has a problem that we can help him with or he wouldn't be a Friend Suggestion, and second, they never just come out and tell us what it is. 
  Whatever, I clearly don't have the patience for this, so good luck. 
  I just want to help him. 
  Why are you so against that? 
  [GROANS] 
  Miles. 
  No, really, I want to know. 
  - Miles. 
  - What? 
  Freemont's leaving. 
  Okay, look, if you really want this to be over, we need to go now. 
  You better be right about this. 
  [SUBDUED MUSIC] 
  Following someone to a cemetery is not how imagined my day would go when I woke up this morning. 
  You were right, Freemont was lying. 
  I guess he didn't just come to New York to see the sights. 
  Sergeant Joseph Stephenson. 
  You think he has something to do with the reason the God Account sent us Freemont's name? 
  That's what we're gonna find out. 
  - - I can't believe you finally found Joy, that's great! 
  Yeah, the jury's still out on that one. 
  Why are you whispering? 
  Well, she's in the next room with Rakesh. 
  They're looking into our Friend Suggestion. 
  So, how'd you get roped into this? 
  Oh, let's just say I have a very particular set of skills that come in handy when we're trying to figure out how to help someone. 
  You're a hacker? 
  I wouldn't call myself a hacker. 
  - Well, what do you call yourself? 
  - Super hacker. 
  So I take it you and Joy aren't hitting it off? 
  Not exactly. 
  I mean, right now she is my only hope of keeping my podcast alive, and she pretty much wants nothing to do with the God Account. 
  Speaking of which, I've been trying to track you down for a month, and it seems like Joy Chen doesn't really exist outside of your Facebook page. 
  Probably because Joy is my middle name. 
  Constance Joy Chen. 
  Who's she? 
  Uh, that's Cara. 
  Three us were, uh, kind of a team when it came to the God Account, and then she left for Paris right before you showed up. 
  Look, Miles, I know this is hard for you, but it's gotta be hard for her too. 
  She's gonna need your help. 
  You're right. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  It's just, without you here, I have to get all of my advice from Rakesh. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  - I gotta go. 
  I'll talk to you later. 
  Hey, did you find any connection between Freemont and Stephenson? 
  Mm-mm, nothing. 
  As far as I can tell, their paths never crossed. 
  Why would Freemont travel all the way to new York to visit the grave of a Marine he's never met? 
  I mean, come on, we've gotta be missing something. 
  Well, seems like we're at a dead end, so text me if you find anything. 
  Oh, you're leaving. 
  What a surprise. 
  No, it's not. 
  I told you that I would come and see what your hacker friend could find out which was nothing. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  [CELL PHONE BUZZES] 
  - - What? 
  The God Account just liked Webster Park. 
  Is this supposed to mean something? 
  Uh, no, no. 
  No, no, no. 
  Sometimes, the God Account just likes stuff. 
  We don't know why. 
  But hey, we will text you if we find anything. 
  Yep. 
  Nope, I can see myself out. 
  [DOOR CLICKS SHUT] 
  "Sometimes the God Account just likes things, we don't know why"? 
  What was that about? 
  She doesn't want this. 
  Bro, the God Account sent her the Friend Suggestion, not you. 
  She's the one who needs to help Lieutenant Freemont and you need to help her do that. 
  Come on, bro, think about it. 
  Look. 
  She didn't get another Friend Suggestion till the two of you came together, right? 
  So in my opinion, - you need to be her Obi-Wan. 
  - [CURIOUS MUSIC] 
  Train her in the ways of the Force, all right? 
  You know, in this case, it's the God Account. 
  It's simple "Star Wars" math. 
  This is not "Star Wars," Rakesh, this is my life! 
  So I'm going to prove to the God Account that Joy is the wrong choice, and when I do, everything's gonna go back to the way it's supposed to be. 
  Mm-hmm, you're going to Webster Park, aren't you? 
  Yes, I am. 
  That's not very Jedi of you. 
  [MUSIC FADES] 
  - Thank you for for coming over. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  There's something I need to talk to you about. 
  Okay. 
  This morning, you wanted to go over and see that apartment and I told you I had plans with Reverend Carver to tie up some loose ends. 
  Mm-hmm That wasn't true. 
  I don't understand. 
  I didn't want to see the place because I don't want to move. 
  Arthur we have talked about this, we agreed that we would find a new home together. 
  I know, yes, we did. 
  It's just wedding cakes and tuxedos and leaving the church it's a lot. 
  And I'm just not ready to move on from this house. 
  I mean, Miles took his first step right over there. 
  Ella braided Ali's hair for the first time in that chair. 
  Everywhere I look are memories. 
  Yes. 
  And they're your memories with Ella. 
  And I'm not asking you to let go of them. 
  I am asking you to make new ones with me. 
  And we can, right here. 
  No, we can't. 
  I'm sorry, Arthur. 
  I can't give you what you're asking for. 
  So where does that leave us? 
  I don't know. 
  I, uh, found Annie. 
  - Are you serious? 
  - Yeah. 
  She's here, she's in Paris. 
  That's amazing! 
  Cara, there's something I need to, uh, tell you. 
  I wasn't honest with you earlier. 
  I know who Annie Keller is. 
  Wait, what are you talking about? 
  Five years ago, she was doing a story about me. 
  She found out that I had stolen the Juliet code, so she came to Paris to find Henry to confirm it. 
  A story that could've destroyed me. 
  So you killed it. 
  Not just the story, but I, uh I made sure she was discredited. 
  And because of me she's never worked as a journalist again. 
  [GASPS] 
  Cara I'm really sorry. 
  There are a lot of things I did back then that I am not proud of. 
  Look, Simon, I think you should go. 
  She's in the 17th. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Yeah [HIP-HOP VOCAL MUSIC] 
  You were new to the school as a freshman Well, well. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I could ask you the same thing, but I'm pretty sure I already know. 
  I'm assuming the God Account doesn't just like something for no reason. 
  As a lawyer, you learn pretty quickly when someone is lying to you. 
  It usually likes something as a way of helping us out, pointing us in the right direction. 
  I see what's going on here. 
  You want me to fail so you can somehow prove to the God Account that it made a mistake in choosing me. 
  Didn't it? 
  Good game, fellas. 
  Just so you know, when someone tells me I can't do something, that's exactly when I show them I can. 
  What are you about to do? 
  Joy. 
  Joy! 
  Lieutenant Freemont? 
  Joy Chen, we met earlier at the bar. 
  Yeah. 
  What are you guys doing here? 
  Actually, we came to talk to you. 
  About what? 
  Sergeant Joseph Stephenson. 
  - Who is he? 
  - You two been following me? 
  I know how this looks, but we just want to help. 
  How did you know Sgt. 
  Stephenson? 
  I didn't. 
  And I suggest these little run-ins stop happening. 
  So came all the way to New York to visit the grave of a soldier you never knew? 
  I don't think so. 
  [SIGHS, WHEEZES] 
  [GASPING] 
  Hey, hey, man, have a seat. 
  Hey, are you okay? 
  I can't breathe. 
  We need to get him to a hospital. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  I understand you two brought in Lt. 
  James Freemont? 
  Yes, we did, how's he doing? 
  What's your relationship with him? 
  I'm his fiancÃ©e. 
  We ran some tests, and your fiancÃ© is suffering from something called coronary microvascular disease. 
  It's a heart condition that's hard to detect That sounds pretty serious. 
  It can be. 
  The disease is treatable, but James is insisting on returning to service. 
  You need to convince him otherwise. 
  - Why? 
  - Because with his condition, the emotional and physical stress could kill him. 
  [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC] 
  Thanks for your help. 
  It was just a little dehydration. 
  The doctor told us about your heart condition. 
  Why? 
  We're engaged. 
  It's not important. 
  You can't go back, James. 
  Oh, the hell I can't. 
  Doc says it won't even show up on an Army physical. 
  That's not the point, and you know it. 
  I'm not gonna let some hiccup with my heart keep me from serving my country. 
  This is more than a hiccup. 
  If you push yourself too hard, you could Die? 
  Yeah, I made peace with that the moment I put on this uniform. 
  What about the rest of your unit? 
  You'd be putting them at risk. 
  Look, I'll always have their backs just like they'll always have mine, end of story. 
  - Hey, listen to me - No, you listen to me. 
  You have no idea what it's like to to find your purpose. 
  To know you're helping people, making a difference, only to have someone tell you it's over? 
  [MELANCHOLY MUSIC] 
  [SIGHS] 
  Actually, I know exactly what that is like. 
  The anger, the frustration, the fear that you don't know who you are anymore. 
  James you will find your new purpose. 
  No, I'm a soldier. 
  That's who I am. 
  Ship out tomorrow night, nothing's gonna change that. 
  We have to find a way to convince him not to go back. 
  That's what this is about. 
  This is too much. 
  I-I can't have someone's life in my hands, I You win, Miles. 
  You wanted the Account all to yourself, it it's yours. 
  Hey, wait, J-Joy. 
  Cara! 
  Hi, Annie. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  What are you doing here? 
  It's kind of a long story. 
  Well, come in. 
  Tell me, I want to hear everything. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Wow. 
  So you found Susan, that's amazing! 
  Yeah, yeah, and it's all because of you. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  I don't know what to say, I'm just so proud of you! 
  Look at you a star journalist, you have incredible boyfriend, a relationship with your mom. 
  I know. 
  It's kind of hard to believe. 
  No, actually. 
  It's exactly where I knew you'd end up. 
  What about you? 
  How are things? 
  Things are great. 
  I work in a little art gallery. 
  Plenty of time to enjoy the city, no stress anyway, what are you doing in Paris? 
  I'm sort of writing a book. 
  Really? 
  How Hemingway. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  What's it about? 
  It's a biography about a tech billionaire who's trying to change the world. 
  I used to cover the tech beat. 
  Who is it? 
  Maybe I know them. 
  Actually, you do. 
  It's Simon Hayes. 
  [LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
 
 
 
  Simon Hayes. 
  Hmm, he ruined my life, but judging by the fact that you buried the lede there, I'm guessing you already knew that. 
  He just told me this morning. 
  Look, there is no excuse for what Simon did to you. 
  Is that why you came here? 
  You want me to tell you that it's okay? 
  No, I wanted to see you. 
  Well, you have. 
  So good luck with your book, Cara. 
  You should go. 
  Annie. 
  Wait, can't we talk about this? 
  If you're writing a book about Simon Hayes, we have nothing to talk about. 
  So let me get this straight. 
  The God Account is sending Joy Friend Suggestions instead of you. 
  Yeah, except she doesn't want the responsibility. 
  Well, lucky for her, she has someone who's been down that road and can walk her through it. 
  - Or maybe not. 
  - Look, Dad, I know the type of person that's right for the job, and it is not her. 
  So what are you gonna do? 
  I have to help Lieutenant Freemont on my own. 
  Oh, I see. 
  And if you do, then the God Account sees that you are still the right man for the job. 
  What's wrong with that? 
  I've done everything it's asked of me. 
  And now it's asking you to help Joy. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Honestly, I don't know what it's asking me. 
  All I know is I'm not ready to let it go. 
  Well. 
  That, I understand. 
  What do you mean? 
  Trish wants me to sell the house and to move in to a new home with her, and I'm not ready for that. 
  Why not? 
  I spent my life with your mother in that house, I raised you and your sister in that house. 
  That house is who I am. 
  No, Dad, it's not, okay? 
  It's just a house. 
  And the memories you made there, you get to take them with you. 
  [SENTIMENTAL MUSIC] 
  - [DOOR CLICKS SHUT] 
  - Miles. 
  Former Reverend Finer. 
  What's up, Rakesh? 
  So, now that we know Joy's full name, I was able to dig into her life a little bit, and I found out what kind of lawyer she was a public defender. 
  You do not do that kind of work unless you're really trying to make a difference. 
  You know, all this time, you've been telling me why Joy is wrong for the God Account. 
  Maybe it's time to ask yourself why she's right. 
  [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC] 
  [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] 
  What are you doing here? 
  Why didn't you tell me you were a public defender back in Chicago? 
  Why does it matter? 
  Because you said you weren't the helping type. 
  But your job is all about helping those in need. 
  Look, I was jealous that you were getting Friend Suggestions and not me. 
  So much so that I forgot how hard it was when I was first asked to do this. 
  I wanted to run, but I didn't, and I am telling you, it was the best decision I have ever made in my life. 
  Yeah, well, I haven't been making great life decisions lately, so But that's what I'm trying to say. 
  It's not just about helping people, the God Account brought Cara into my life. 
  It even helped me fix my relationship with my dad. 
  My problems can't be fixed. 
  But they can! 
  Lieutenant Freemont's problems seem unfixable too. 
  But if the God Account sent us his name, then it's not. 
  And when you see what the God Account can do what we can do nothing will seem impossible. 
  [LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  I'm heading to the Army recruiting office to talk to Private Caffey, see if he could help. 
  I hope to see you there. 
  Wait. 
  For the record I'm not sold, I'm just keeping an open mind. 
  Take a look at these. 
  If you have any questions, just give me a call. 
  It was a pleasure. 
  Private Caffey. 
  We met at Conway's bar yesterday. 
  Oh, yeah, sure! 
  - Uh, Miles and Joy, right? 
  - Hey. 
  Yeah, what are you doing here? 
  I assume you're not here to enlist. 
  No, actually, we're here about Lieutenant Freemont. 
  What about him? 
  Well, uh, he has a heart condition, and if he returns to duty, it could be life-threatening, so we were hoping that you could talk to him. 
  There's nothing to talk about. 
  Nothing to talk about? 
  How about his heart might explode? 
  Well, Freemont's the most dedicated soldier I've ever served with, so I trust him to make the right decision. 
  - Yeah, but he's not. 
  - According to you. 
  Is there anything else? 
  Good. 
  Then I suggest you find the front door. 
  Find it quick? 
  Actually, the Military Code of Justice requires soldiers to reveal any condition that might impede their sworn duty. 
  Withholding said information is grounds for court martial, and since you now know about his condition, that makes you an accessory and subject to court martial as well. 
  Look, I want to help, but the Army's everything to Freemont. 
  He's not gonna listen to me. 
  Yeah, well, is there anyone that he will listen to? 
  Actually, there's a woman that he met during our second tour, Rose. 
  Technically, they haven't actually met. 
  What does that mean? 
  She was a volunteer with The Soldier's Aid. 
  It's a service that pairs civilians with soldiers. 
  They write letters, they send care packages. 
  Freemont and Rose started emailing each other. 
  They fell in love. 
  It's the first time I ever heard him talk about a life outside the Army. 
  And what happened? 
  She broke it off with him six months ago. 
  I don't know why. 
  But he was devastated. 
  Do you know Rose's last name? 
  Yeah, Stephenson. 
  Stephenson? 
  That was the last name on the grave that Freemont visited. 
  Looks like you guys were right. 
  Rose is Joseph Stephenson's sister, and she lives in New York. 
  Well, that's why Freemont came here. 
  He was hoping to see her. 
  I wonder what happened between them. 
  It says her brother passed away six months ago. 
  That's around the same time she broke things off with Freemont. 
  She probably didn't want to lose another person she loved. 
  That's what the God Account wanted us to know. 
  We have to bring them back together and show Freemont that he can have a life outside of the Army with Rose. 
  Rakesh, now would be a good time to use those acquired skills. 
  Already on it. 
  Oh, you guys are not gonna believe this. 
  Rose is not in New York. 
  She's in Paris. 
  [LIGHT ENERGETIC MUSIC] 
  - [PHONE CHIMES] 
  - Hey. 
  I just got up, what's going on? 
  Do you have some time to work on a God Account case? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  All right, so Caffey said that Lieutenant Freemont wanted to check out Times Square before he left, so he has to be here somewhere. 
  Okay, well, even if he is, you think that Cara can track down Rose in time? 
  Uh, yes. 
  She's going to FaceTime me as soon as she gets to her hotel and hopefully Rose can convince him not to ship out. 
  Well, assuming we can find him. 
  in the middle of Times Square, at night. 
  Look. 
  Hey! 
  - We need to talk. 
  - You two again? 
  There's nothing you can say that'll change my mind. 
  We know about Rose and her brother and why she broke things off. 
  You still love her, don't you? 
  It doesn't matter. 
  No, it is the only thing that matters. 
  Now, look, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but my girlfriend Cara is trying to track down Rose right now in Paris. 
  - Wait, Paris? 
  - Not important. 
  At any moment, she's going to FaceTime me. 
  All you have to do is talk to her. 
  I can't. 
  When she broke things off, she told me not to contact her. 
  Look, I made my decision, it's too late. 
  That's not why you won't talk to her. 
  You won't talk to her because you're afraid that it isn't too late. 
  Most people don't understand how frightening hope can be, but I do. 
  You have a chance to reconnect with her. 
  Don't waste it. 
  [PHONE CHIMES] 
  Oh, hey, hey, Cara! 
  Miles, I'm sorry, Rose checked out of her hotel yesterday. 
  Well, for a minute there, you had me believing. 
  Guess that's that. 
  [POWER GRID THRUMS] 
  [CROWD EXCLAIMS] 
  - Miles, what's hap  
  - [DISCONNECTION CHIME] 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  [CROWD MURMURING, HORNS HONKING] 
  What's going on, Miles? 
  I have no idea. 
  [ELECTRICITY THRUMS] 
  [CROWD EXCLAIMS] 
  [GIANT SCREENS WHOOSHING] 
  [LIGHT UPBEAT MUSIC] 
  Holy crap. 
  How is this possible? 
  The God Account? 
  James! 
  James. 
  [EMOTIONAL MUSIC] 
  Rose! 
  What are you doing here? 
  Me? 
  You're the one on the jumbotron! 
  I just got back in from out of town and I was passing by and I look up and I see you 40 feet high! 
  I-I thought I might be dreaming. 
  Maybe we are. 
  It's really nice to finally meet you, Lieutenant. 
  Actually, uh I'm not gonna be a Lieutenant much longer. 
  I've decided I'm leaving the Army. 
  I wanna start a new life, and I want you to be in it. 
  I have never stopped loving you, Rose, and I hope you still feel the same. 
  [CROWD EXCLAIMS] 
  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
  Whoo! 
  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
  See? 
  I told you. 
  Nothing is impossible. 
  [APPLAUSE] 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Does it always feel like this? 
  Uh, yeah. 
  Yeah, it does. 
  Now I know why you wanted to keep it all to yourself. 
  Can I ask you something? 
  What did you mean when you told Lieutenant Freemont you understood how frightening hope could be? 
  [SOFT UPBEAT MUSIC] 
  I have a daughter. 
  I gave her up for adoption when she was born. 
  I was 16. 
  I wasn't ready. 
  [SIGHS] 
  She's the reason I'm here in New York. 
  - To find her? 
  - Yeah. 
  I didn't burn out. 
  I loved my job, I love helping people. 
  But I had to make a choice. 
  And what do you ink? 
  Did you make the right choice? 
  You really ask a lot of questions, Miles. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  So what happens now? 
  Honestly? 
  I don't know. 
  You're still gonna help me with all of this, right? 
  For as long as you need. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Look, I think that it's time for both of us to start accepting what our new roles are. 
  Hey, it's cool if you want to talk about me on your podcast. 
  Yeah? 
  I'm just gonna need you to sign an NDA on a few things. 
  Not signing an NDA. 
  Yes! 
  Yes, you are. 
  - No! 
  - Yes, you are. 
  Don't let go again I got your message. 
  So what what are we doing here? 
  This is the house that you wanted us to look at, so I came to see it for myself. 
  When I did, it dawned on me that it's a few blocks from the church, around the corner from Sylvia's, and the park where I play chess. 
  That's why I was so interested in it, because I knew moving out of your home wouldn't be easy for you. 
  I'm sorry I didn't see that sooner. 
  And I'm sorry for not wanting to compromise on this. 
  I-I'm glad you didn't. 
  It is why I love you, and you were right. 
  We need a place to make our own memories, and I think that this home is the perfect place to do that. 
  And I thought that too. 
  But as you can see, someone already bought it. 
  I know. 
  I bought it. 
  [SENTIMENTAL NOTES] 
  What? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - This is incredible! 
  What? 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  Ah! 
  [LAUGHS] 
  So, you gonna be okay passing the torch to Joy? 
  Yeah, I think so. 
  Oh, I saw the video of Lieutenant Freemont and Rose went viral. 
  That must've been amazing to be there. 
  Yeah, yeah, it was. 
  It was. 
  Yeah, for a second, it was kinda like I was back on the team. 
  Hey, you'll always be a part of the team. 
  [KNOCKING AT DOOR] 
  Oh, um, I gotta go, but I'll call you later. 
  Yeah, I'll talk to you later. 
  Hey. 
  I have been thinking about you since you left my apartment. 
  Do you want to come in? 
  I'm not proud of the way I acted and, um, I'm sorry. 
  Hey, don't be, okay? 
  It was a lot to take in. 
  I just haven't thought about these things in a very long time. 
  - I get it. 
  - Can we start again? 
  I would love that. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  By the way, you said something yesterday that I didn't understand, that because of me you found Susan? 
  What did you mean? 
  Oh, well, the Facebook message you sent me five years ago saying you heard my mom moved to New York. 
  I never sent a Facebook message about your mom being in New York. 
  I didn't have any idea where she was until you told me yesterday. 
  But it came from your Facebook account. 
  [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC] 
  If you didn't send it, then who did? 
  A lot has happened since I last recorded, but I'll get into the details in a bit. 
  I have been obsessed with delivering you the best season two that I forgot the most important lesson from season one: helping people. 
  Because when you do, when you put others before yourself, good things always happen. 
  Private. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Rose, this is Caffey. 
  - It's nice to meet you. 
  - Nice to meet you. 
  So what'd you want to see me about? 
  So I spoke to the head of Army recruiting, told him all about you. 
  What do you say? 
  Wanna put that uniform back on and change some lives? 
  Absolutely. 
  And most of the time, we learn something new about ourselves, about what we're willing to give up to move forward. 
  I'm not saying that this is an easy thing to do. 
  Taking that next step never is. 
  But sometimes, looking into your past is the only way to discover your future. 
  Hey, I got your message. 
  Look. 
  I'm really sorry about Annie. 
  I know you are, but that's not why I texted you. 
  What's going on? 
  I talked with Annie, and it turns out she never sent me that Facebook message about my mom being in New York. 
  - Who did? 
  - Somebody who had the ability to hack her Facebook account. 
  Somebody who wanted me in New York to find my mom, and most importantly, to meet Miles. 
  You think it was the God Account. 
  If I'm right, that means the God Account has been pulling the strings for a lot longer than we ever imagined, and maybe it still is. 
  Simon, I don't think I'm here just to write your book. 
  I think the God Account wants me here for something bigger. 
  I don't know where I'm supposed to go from here. 
  All I know is that I am ready to pass along everything that I learned to Joy. 
  And as for what comes next for me, that's what I gotta fire out. 
  And when I do you'll be first to know. 
  Right next to me Hoo. 
  Yo, you ready? 
  - Yeah. 
  - I'm starving. 
  - I'm only human after all  
  - [RAG'N'BONE MAN'S "HUMAN" PLAYING] 
  I'm only human after all  
  - Miles? 
  - Mm-hmm? 
  Don't put the blame on me Please tell me you were listening to that. 
  I wasn't. 
  - I'm only human  
  - Look. 
  The God Account left a message on your wall. 
  "Follow the Lady. 
  Find your Path. 
  " W-w-what do you think it means? 
  I don't know, Miles. 
  I do know one thing, though. 
  I don't think the God Account is done with you just yet.
