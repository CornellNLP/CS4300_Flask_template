 Previously on "God Friended Me" I'm running the God Account code through the IdentitySeal server. 
  What the hell happened? 
  Dude, does this have something to do with the software you were running? 
  No. 
  Maybe. 
  Can I have everybody's attention? 
  IdentitySeal has been sold. 
  - To who? 
  - Simon Hayes. 
  Simon Hayes? 
  He's like the Bill Gates of A. I. , dude. 
  What if Simon Hayes is behind the God Account? 
  When your mother was in the audience, I played every note for her. 
  It may be time for you to play for someone else. 
  If you want it to be for Trish, that's okay Mom would want you to. 
  You're DJ Trek? 
  - I also go by Nia. 
  - Miles. 
  Cara and I are just friends. 
  I can't help but think that there's more to that. 
  Everything okay? 
  Nia just broke things off with me. 
  [DENM'S "GOOD THING"] 
  My podcast is up 13%. 
  Finally. 
  "After a few episodes, I can't stop listening. 
  " "Excited to know who's behind the God Account. 
  " [KNOCKING AT DOOR] 
  Surprise. 
  What's with the bags? 
  Is everything okay? 
  Yeah, everything's fine. 
  Uh, found out last night my building's being fumigated today. 
  Is it cool if I crash here for a couple days? 
  No, of course, of course, as much as time as you need. 
  Where's Dee? 
  She is at a dance workshop in Chicago. 
  So, lucky for you, it's just me. 
  Okay, yeah, I [CHUCKLES] 
  I see what's going on here. 
  What? 
  Al, I'm fine, okay? 
  Yes, I miss Nia, but this is not my first breakup, okay? 
  I don't need a shoulder to cry on or a babysitter or my little sis taking time to psychoanalyze me. 
  My building really is being fumigated. 
  - Really? 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  Sorry to break it to you, Miles, but not everything is about you. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  - Oh, look at that. 
  I did have the time to psychoanalyze you. 
  Oh, okay, look, I'll take the couch. 
  - The bedroom's all yours. 
  - Thank you. 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  This place feels different. 
  We need to be on high alert. 
  For what exactly? 
  I don't know, but you really think Simon Hayes buying IdentitySeal is just a coincidence? 
  Bro, look, I admit the timing is strange, but he's a tech billionaire. 
  He probably buys tech companies all the time. 
  Exactly. 
  It's like the perfect cover to spy on us, see what we know. 
  Uh Donald. 
  Bro, that's my desk. 
  Not anymore. 
  New management just reshuffled desk assignments. 
  Oh, so everyone's got new seats? 
  Actually, so far, it's just you. 
  Your new desk is now over there. 
  Also, they want to meet with you tomorrow. 
  Why? 
  Don't know. 
  I only ask questions if it impacts me. 
  [SUSPICIOUS MUSIC] 
  What do you think management wants to meet with you about? 
  No idea, but whatever it is, you can be sure Simon Hayes is behind this. 
  Lord, we thank You for this, our blessed food, for Your grace, as we are ever mindful of the needs of others. 
  Amen. 
  Bon appÃ©tit. 
  I'm sorry that I had to cancel our last date. 
  Um, a parishioner called. 
  They were in crisis. 
  You don't need to explain. 
  I mean, I can't even imagine what it's like having so many people depending on you. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Well, thank you, but still, I know it can be frustrating. 
  I'm not gonna lie. 
  I I would love to see you more, but, look, life is busy I get it. 
  I'm a mom of two. 
  I'm the sole owner of a music store. 
  - [BOTH LAUGHING] 
  - I mean, I've had to cancel my share of plans myself, trust me. 
  Yeah, you would think after 25 years, it would get easier. 
  Well, maybe one of these days, I'll take a break. 
  Hmm. 
  You know I have a farm upstate, and I haven't been in a while. 
  Why don't we get away? 
  That sounds very nice. 
  I can't even remember the last time I've been out of the city. 
  Well, I think fresh air might do you some good, and I can pick you up Sunday after services. 
  Ah [STAMMERS] 
  It sounds wonderful but Sundays are hard for me. 
  Maybe another time? 
  Sure. 
  Sure. 
  Yeah, another time. 
  I'm telling you something strange is going on. 
  First, they want to separate us, then they want to meet with me. 
  If Simon Hayes really is behind the God Account, why wouldn't he want to meet with Miles? 
  I mean, no offense, but he's the one the God Account friended. 
  Speaking of Simon Hayes, have you heard from Pria? 
  No, and how do you know about her? 
  Because I listen to your podcast. 
  It's getting good. 
  It's like "Serial," only with people I actually know. 
  - Hmm. 
  - [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  Maybe the new management wants to meet with you because you're good at what you do? 
  Doubtful. 
  Last week I put a customer on hold when I heard there was cake in the break room. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  - Okay, not about customer service. 
  I mean, with computers. 
  You're a good coder. 
  Yeah, no, no, she's right, and you also did apply for that I. 
  T. 
  job last year. 
  - Maybe it could be about that. 
  - You think? 
  I mean, what seems more likely? 
  Simon Hayes buys an entire company just to spy on you, or someone at IdentitySeal thinks your skills would be better off in another area of the company? 
  Occam's razor well played. 
  [CELL PHONE CHIMES] 
  Oh. 
  Oh, got a new Friend Suggestion. 
  Felicia Washington. 
  - [CELL PHONE CHIMES AND BUZZES] 
  - Wait, that's weird. 
  I just got another one. 
  - Jas - [CELL PHONE CHIMES AND BUZZES] 
  - Another one? 
  - Yeah. 
  [CELL PHONE CHIMING AND BUZZING] 
  Whoa. 
  Uh, bro, is your phone broken? 
  - No, I don't think so. 
  - How many are there? 
  We just got 76 Friend Suggestions. 
  [CELL PHONE CHIMES] 
  Jennifer Frost, owner of a clothing store on Frederick Douglass Boulevard. 
  Doris Ehrlich 70 years old, retired. 
  Wait. 
  Didn't we get another Ehrlich? 
  Uh, yeah, yeah, Richard. 
  Oh, yeah, it says they're married. 
  Okay, so we have one connection. 
  Great. 
  So, if everyone was at that wedding, maybe we're onto something. 
  Look, we all know how the God Account works, okay? 
  There must be something that's connecting them all, maybe someone they all know. 
  [INQUISITIVE MUSIC] 
  Hey, wait, go back to that last Friend Suggestion. 
  Click on their profile pic. 
  Yeah, look, that's the same building that's in this photo. 
  Wait. 
  Let me zoom in, try and run an address search. 
  Morning. 
  - ALL: Morning. 
  - Any coffee left? 
  You know it's 10:00 a. m. , right? 
  You know I work nights, right? 
  I left the pot on. 
  Thank you. 
  - No way. 
  - What? 
  - I think I found a connection. 
  - What? 
  All 76 Friend Suggestions have the same address 1204 East 123rd Street. 
  They all live in the same building? 
  Okay, I'll call a Lyft. 
  Um, I have a meeting with upper management today some conference room on the sixth floor. 
  Unless Should I cancel? 
  I mean, 76 Friend Suggestions sounds like an all-hands-on-deck kind of situation. 
  Oh, no, no, go to your meeting. 
  We'll be fine. 
  Call me when you're done, okay? 
  - Good luck. 
  - [DOOR OPENS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  Don't have too much fun without me. 
  What'd I miss? 
  So how long is your sister staying with you? 
  Oh, only for a few days. 
  Just until her apartment is done being fumigated. 
  Hmm, nice, a little brother-sister bonding time. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  I'm pretty sure she's just checking up on me, making sure I'm okay. 
  Are you? 
  Eh Well, having just been through a breakup, I'm here if you want to talk about it. 
  Thanks. 
  And I think I'm good, you know. 
  When it's not right, it's not right. 
  Yeah, I know what you mean. 
  - On a positive note - [BOTH LAUGH] 
  My podcast is up 13%. 
  - That's great. 
  - Yeah. 
  People are really digging the God Account stories. 
  I mean, half of the comments are about Pria and whether or not she's found Falken. 
  Yeah, well, you have to admit it is a great mystery. 
  So 76 Friend Suggestions. 
  That is a lot of doors to knock on. 
  Yeah, well, that's assuming we can even get in the building. 
  Oh. 
  Well, now that we're both single, want to move in together? 
  [LAUGHS] 
  That's a little fast, but, okay. 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  You guys are in luck. 
  I just put the sign up this morning. 
  - - You'll be the first to see it, but if I were you, I wouldn't wait too long. 
  Oh, yeah? 
  Yeah, not every day an apartment opens up in this building. 
  Most of the tenants here are lifers, myself included. 
  Yeah, how long you lived here? 
  Oh, since I was born. 
  This place, I can't imagine living anywhere else. 
  It's more than just a building. 
  It's a true community. 
  [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
  Oh, Mrs. 
  Washington, hello. 
  How are you? 
  - - Doing just fine, William. 
  Well, that's good. 
  This is Miles and Cara. 
  They're interested in apartment 4D. 
  Oh, beautiful couple like you? 
  You all will fit right in. 
  Oh, that's so nice. 
  Did you hear that, sweetie? 
  - Yes, I did. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  Did William tell you he's a playwright? 
  He's gonna be famous one day. 
  - Oh, I don't know about that. 
  - Oh, nonsense. 
  A famous writer lived here back when this place was first built. 
  William will carry on that tradition. 
  [LAUGHING] 
  Well, nice to see you. 
  Okay. 
  Okay, take care. 
  After you. 
  [KEYS JINGLING] 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  On your marks, get set. . 
  You're gonna want to step aside. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  - Go! 
  [CHILDREN GIGGLING] 
  Oh-ho-ho! 
  [CHILDREN SHOUTING HAPPILY] 
  Hey. 
  Oh, that's Marcos, 4A, and his kids Mateo, Luca, and Nico. 
  Here we are, this is apartment 4D. 
  The owner of the building renovated the apartment recently. 
  Uh, are these new cabinets? 
  Uh, yep, updated appliances, new fixtures, and new floors. 
  What about the water pressure? 
  - [CELL PHONE CHIMES AND BUZZES] 
  - Oh, it's the best. 
  Uh, listen, I don't want to rush you guys, but there's a tenant meeting about to start in the common room. 
  Well, uh, you think it'd be okay if we tag along? 
  Just to get a sense of this amazing community. 
  Yes, of course, it'd be my pleasure. 
  Mr. Singh. 
  Robyn Bell, HR. 
  Let me start by asking, do you like working at IdentitySeal? 
  Uh, yeah, very much. 
  And are you happy with your position in customer service? 
  Absolutely. 
  You don't find it uninspiring? 
  Okay. 
  All right, I'm gonna need you to level with me here? 
  Is this about Simon Hayes? 
  Did he put you up to this? 
  - I'm not sure I understand. 
  - I see. 
  Are we done with this little charade? 
  'Cause I'd really like to go back to my "incredibly uninspiring life" in customer service. 
  So you're not interested in a promotion? 
  Um excuse me? 
  So, in addition to William and Mrs. 
  Washington, we have Marcos and his three kids. 
  I found out that his wife works. 
  He's a stay-at-home dad. 
  Olivia teaches kindergarten, moved back in with her parents until she can paid off her student loans. 
  Yeah, and Shannon and Karen Murphy they're celebrating their 20th next month. 
  They invited the entire building to a Guinness keg party on the roof. 
  - Reason enough to move in. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  William was right this is a great group of people. 
  Why would the God Account send us their names? 
  Excuse me, someone I got to talk to. 
  Hi, what, uh what are you two doing here? 
  We need to speak to our tenants. 
  About what? 
  I think it's better if I address them directly. 
  Okay. 
  Hello, can I have everyone's attention, please? 
  If everyone can please sit down. 
  Thank you. 
  Many of you know me. 
  For those of you who don't, my name is Denise. 
  My father and I own this building or at least we did. 
  Developers made us an offer that we couldn't pass up. 
  This building has been sold. 
  [CROWD MURMURING] 
  Unfortunately, the new owners well, they plan to demolish this property to build a luxury hotel. 
  [CROWD SHOUTING] 
  I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have 30 days to vacate. 
  [SHOUTING CONTINUES] 
  [SOMBER MUSIC] 
  [SIGHS] 
  Looks like we just found out why the God Account sent us their names. 
  [CROWD SHOUTING] 
  Hector, I have lived here all my life. 
  You know that! 
  Where am I supposed to go? 
  Mrs. 
  Washington, I understand this is a shock. 
  A shock? 
  My parents can't move. 
  What are they supposed to do? 
  We know you all have a lot of questions, and we'll do our best to answer them. 
  Denise, let's go. 
  [SHOUTING CONTINUES] 
  You know what this place means to these people. 
  You grew up here. 
  You can't do this! 
  Look, I know you've always had a hard time understanding this, but this isn't about me. 
  It's just business. 
  That's all. 
  No, see, that's him talking. 
  That's not you. 
  Good-bye, William. 
  [SOMBER MUSIC] 
  Hey, is there anything we can do to help? 
  I don't see how. 
  I can't believe that they would do this. 
  I mean, I can see Hector, but not Denise. 
  You seem to know her well. 
  I should. 
  She's my sister. 
  So that means Hector is My father, yes. 
  We don't really talk anymore. 
  He wanted me to take over the real-estate business, and then I decided to follow my dream of becoming a writer. 
  After that, well, other than letting me stay here, he turned his back on me. 
  So why don't you just talk to your sister? 
  I wish I could. 
  Denise and I we haven't seen each other in a year. 
  We used to be thick as thieves growing up. 
  It was the only way to survive life under my father. 
  I have a sister, too, okay? 
  Whenever my father and I were going through something, my sister was there when I needed her. 
  There's a special bond that can never go away no matter how long it's been. 
  Maybe you can get her to talk to your dad about selling the building, change their minds? 
  I really wish I could believe that, but you heard her. 
  She sounds like him now. 
  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to calm a lot of nervous people down. 
  Look, if he's not gonna talk to her, then we need to. 
  You think there's a way we can get her to change her mind? 
  Maybe, or at the very least convince her that kicking people out of their homes could make for very bad press. 
  And bad press can scare off the buyers. 
  Hello, Mr. Singh. 
  I'm Dayna Chessin the new VP of Technology at IdentitySeal. 
  Is there an old VP of Technology? 
  Not that I'm aware of. 
  Uh, so, about that promotion the nice lady from HR was telling me about We'll get to that. 
  First, there's been some suspicious incidents over the last few months that I wanted to talk to you about. 
  Oh, uh, suspicious? 
  Like what? 
  For example, on October 24th, someone tethered the IdentitySeal mainframe. 
  Do you know how to tether a mainframe? 
  Me? 
  No. 
  [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] 
  I mean, I might I might. 
  I do. 
  I do, but I didn't tether it if that's what you're asking me. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Can you tell me about the Spiral Galaxy that appeared on everyone's monitors after an unexplainable system-wide meltdown? 
  I had nothing to do with that. 
  So you're not aware of a third-party code being analyzed at the time that overloaded the system? 
  I'm gonna go with a no. 
  How about a breach of the IdentitySeal mainframe a few weeks ago? 
  Someone running a state-of-the-art decryption program to break through firewalls. 
  Let me guess, you had nothing to do with that either. 
  [STAMMERS, CHUCKLES] 
  You know, I'm so happy in customer service, and if it's okay, I'd really like to pass on this promotion. 
  I think I have everything I need. 
  That's all for today. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Thanks for meeting with us. 
  Like I said on the phone, what's happening at your building might make for an interesting op-ed piece. 
  Big bag wolf, huffing and puffing and blowing people out of their homes. 
  - Is that it? 
  - Isn't it? 
  No, it's not. 
  How well do you know my brother? 
  Actually, we're new friends. 
  Why? 
  As much as he thinks that my father and I are the bad guys, no one wants to put anyone out on the streets. 
  We can help them relocate. 
  That's what I went down there for and was trying to explain. 
  Well, it's kind of hard to hear anything after, "You have 30 days to leave your home. 
  " I get it, but that doesn't change the facts. 
  If this really is just about business, then there has to be a third option that lets them stay. 
  What about finding another buyer? 
  If you have another buyer that doesn't want to tear it down and build a high-rise, great, but I'm guessing you don't. 
  What about the people who live there? 
  The tenants in the building across from mine recently went co-op. 
  Maybe they can do the same. 
  Organizing a co-op purchase is a massive undertaking, and we have ticking clock on closing this deal. 
  Well, then we'll work fast. 
  If you can get signatures from all the tenants declaring their intent to enter a co-op agreement, I can take the offer to my father see if I can convince him. 
  So how long are you staying at your brother's? 
  - Just a few days. 
  - Hmm. 
  Hey, how was lunch with Trish? 
  Great. 
  Uh, in fact she invited me to go to her farm upstate. 
  Wow, that's great. 
  But I said no. 
  How come? 
  Are things moving too fast? 
  What, for a trip upstate to a farm? 
  How old-fashioned do you think I am? 
  Then what is it? 
  Well, she offered to come by after Sunday service - to pick me up. 
  - So? 
  So we've been seeing each other for a few months now, and she's never asked about coming to services. 
  Oh. 
  Have you ever invited her? 
  Well, I No. 
  To be honest, I've just been enjoying our time together, which probably I should continue doing. 
  If that were true, I don't think we'd be having this conversation right now. 
  You always say, if something's on your mind Best to get it out. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - Denise agreed to this. 
  - She gave us her word. 
  Now, you'll still have to apply for a loan at some point, but if you can get every tenant to sign at least this petition of intent, she'll present the option to your father. 
  I can't believe she's actually willing to help. 
  If you don't mind me asking, why are you guys so invested in this? 
  You can't like the apartment that much. 
  We just want to help, and we both know how complicated families can be. 
  Yeah. 
  Maybe when this is all said and done, you and your sister can start talking again. 
  I hope so. 
  All right, let's get to work. 
  We don't have much time. 
  You will not regret this, Olivia. 
  Oh, and by the way, whatever you are cooking smells amazing. 
  What guarantees do I have? 
  Well, none, but if you don't sign, you're gonna be thrown out of your home, and your kids won't have this awesome hallway to run down anymore. 
  Mm, that's a good point. 
  Hey, Maria, how are you? 
  Listen, do you have a moment? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Great, thanks. 
  Just need a signature. 
  'Cause the world that we live in is crazy And it's difficult to trust, trust, trust I'm feeling alive Thanks. 
  Great. 
  Thank you. 
  Thank you so much. 
  Alive, alive, alive Thank you truly. 
  Hey. 
  Oh, I wish my Harold was still alive to see this the whole building coming together. 
  You two really came into our lives when we needed it the most. 
  Isn't life funny like that? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, it is. 
  I'm feeling alive I can't believe it. 
  We're really gonna save the building. 
  Yeah. 
  Just one signature left. 
  Alive, alive, alive, I'm feeling alive I'm feeling alive, alive, alive I'm feeling alive I'm feeling alive, alive, alive Let's go see my sister. 
  They're all there. 
  Every one. 
  I can't believe you were able to pull this off. 
  Well, it wouldn't have been possible without your brother's help. 
  People come together when they believe in something. 
  Look, there's something I need to tell you, William. 
  After Cara and Miles left, I spoke to Dad about the building going co-op. 
  He said no. 
  Of course he did. 
  You told us to get those signatures, that you would try and convince your father. 
  We gave those people hope. 
  I wanted this to work out. 
  I really did. 
  You sent us on a fool's errand so Dad could close the deal quietly. 
  And let me guess it's already done. 
  - William - Save it. 
  You know what? 
  You are just like him. 
  You don't care about anyone but yourself. 
  Me? 
  What about you? 
  I would never turn my back on the people that we grew up with. 
  The people that we call family. 
  I know. 
  You only turn your back on your actual family. 
  There's nothing else I can do. 
  I just signed the papers. 
  The building's been sold. 
  [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC] 
  So, if the building's been sold, how are you supposed to help your 76 Friend Suggestions? 
  No idea. 
  Well, I highly doubt the God Account sent you all their names just to have you rent 76 U-Hauls and bubble-wrap their stuff. 
  Well, I mean, you heard Denise, saw how damaged her relationship is with William. 
  This must have something to do with repairing it. 
  Yeah, well, that's great, but how is that gonna help anyone living in that building? 
  [CELL PHONE CHIMES AND BUZZES] 
  It's Dee. 
  I'll call her back. 
  Wait. 
  So what are you gonna do? 
  I mean, it seems like you guys are at a dead end. 
  Yeah, we tend to make things worse before they get better. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  - [CELL PHONE CHIMES AND BUZZES] 
  - Oh. 
 
 
 
  - - The God Account it just liked something called The Little Red Lighthouse. 
  What's the Little Red Lighthouse? 
  Wha it's in Fort Washington Park. 
  Seriously? 
  Guys, it's like the first place I visited when I moved to New York. 
  The first place you visited when you moved to one of the cultural epicenters of the world was a tiny lighthouse? 
  [SCOFFS] 
  How tiny we talking about, though? 
  Look, this must have to do with our Friend Suggestion. 
  No, I agree, but what does a little red lighthouse have to do with helping 76 people who are getting kicked out of their homes? 
  I don't know, but let's find out. 
  - All right, you want to go? 
  - Uh, I can't. 
  I got to go back to IdentitySeal - for one last meeting. 
  - For what? 
  Well, my guess is they're gonna try and have me admit everything I've done involving the God Account. 
  It's never gonna happen. 
  - Tagging along? 
  - I would love to. 
  But I have to get to work. 
  I'll hear about it on the podcast. 
  Okay. 
  - - [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
  I'm glad you came down. 
  I wanted to, uh, talk to you about something. 
  Of course. 
  Um, you know, but if this about us going away together, I mean, there's really nothing to talk about. 
  If you feel like things are moving too fast It's not that. 
  I would love to see your farm, and I'm ready to take the next step with us. 
  Me too. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'm sensing a "but" in there. 
  My church and the people who fill the pews are my life 7 days a week, 365 days of the year. 
  It's not a job. 
  It's who I am. 
  My life is blessed, and I want to share that with you, but I need to ask, and I really want you to think about it, is being a part of all of this something you'd even want? 
  You're saying that in order for us to move forward, I need to become a part of the church? 
  I can tell you it doesn't matter whether you are or not, but my life and my faith are one in the same. 
  I don't know what our relationship would even look like if you were not part of both. 
  I want to be, but I think you're right. 
  I-I I should think about this. 
  Nice to meet you, Rakesh. 
  My name is Spencer Holt. 
  Using my first name, building rapport, lower my defenses I get it. 
  Okay, I saw "The Negotiator. 
  " I didn't want to see it, but I saw it. 
  - Terrible movie. 
  - The worst. 
  Nice try. 
  Okay, can we please just get on with it? 
  Sure. 
  You've denied any knowledge regarding the activities my colleague discussed with you yesterday. 
  - Is that correct? 
  - That's right. 
  Okay. 
  Thanks for coming in. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  That's it? 
  Whoever's behind all this has skills - that are highly specialized. 
  - Meaning? 
  I seriously doubt whether you know what tethering a mainframe even means, let alone how to do it or why anyone would want to. 
  Maybe they were running an AES-256-level decryption program of their own design based on open ciphers first approved by the NSA to protect top-secret government files. 
  Is that what you wanted to hear, Mr. Holt? 
  Actually, yes. 
  Okay, so, since I'm clearly fired, I'm just gonna show myself out. 
  You're not fired. 
  Please. 
  Your ability to find and exploit weaknesses in their servers was the reason Mr. Hayes wanted me to meet you. 
  [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
  I'm in charge of a new division we're starting at IdentitySeal Mobile Applications and Design. 
  Simon wants to design the first app that can not only monitor someone's financial identity as it interacts with global infrastructure, but something that can analyze and identify potential fraud before it happens. 
  Predictive analytics. 
  I knew I had the right man. 
  We see this application as the next cutting-edge advancement in IdentitySeal's business. 
  You want me to work on it? 
  I want you lead the team that's going to code it from the ground up. 
  What do you say? 
  Uh [LAUGHS] 
  Wow. 
  I did not know this was in New York. 
  Hey, did you notice how Ali acted when Dee called earlier? 
  Yeah. 
  Are you sure everything's okay with her? 
  Them? 
  I mean, maybe this isn't about her building being fumigated. 
  If there was something going on, Ali would tell me. 
  Yeah, well, not unless it was something she didn't want to talk about. 
  Look, she shouldn't have to tell you. 
  - Yeah, you're right. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  - You gonna go check it out? 
  - Of course. 
  [UPBEAT MUSIC] 
  Wow. 
  How'd you find this place? 
  My favorite book as a kid was "The Little Red Lighthouse and The Great Gray Bridge. 
  " I used to read it with my dad every night. 
  - It was about - A little red lighthouse? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, the lighthouse took pride in warning boats of the shoreline, until one day men started building a bridge above it. 
  After they finished, the bridge towered above the lighthouse, making it feel small and powerless and unimportant. 
  It was about the bridge representing progress and the lighthouse fearing it would no longer be needed or wanted. 
  Kind of like what's happening at the Ruiz building. 
  Yeah, exactly. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Well, maybe the God Account's feeling thematic. 
  How does it end? 
  Well, it realizes that it can co-exist with the bridge and it's still useful. 
  Hmm. 
  Yeah, let's look around, see what we can find. 
  Hey, check this out. 
  "'The Little Red Lighthouse. 
  ' "This site was declared a historic landmark "due to its connection with Hildegarde H. 
  Swift's famous book of the same name. 
  " Swift. 
  What? 
  What is it? 
  Remember Ms. Washington said a famous author lived in the building when it was first being built? 
  "The Little Red Lighthouse" I think it was published in 1942. 
  It's a pre-war building. 
  If she lived in the building when she wrote the book, that could declare it a historic landmark. 
  Which means the new owners can't tear it down to build a high-rise. 
  This is what the God Account wanted us to see. 
  This is how we can save those people from getting evicted. 
  Mrs. 
  Washington confirmed the author's name who lived in the building was Swift. 
  If she wrote a novel there, the building could be a historical landmark. 
  - We just need proof. 
  - Is there any way to know what apartment she lived in back then? 
  Maybe we could find something that showed she lived there? 
  She said it was 4D. 
  What? 
  That's why my father renovated it so quickly. 
  He knew. 
  He must have figured it out recently. 
  It's why he pushed my sister to sell the building so fast. 
  He was worried if someone found out, he wouldn't be able to sell it. 
  But if he didn't disclose something like that and someone found out, he could end up in jail. 
  Why risk that? 
  Unless My God. 
  There's something I need to tell you. 
  I don't have time for this. 
  It's about your father and the sale of the building. 
  Denise, will you please just listen to him? 
  You can't save the building, William. 
  I'm not trying to save the building. 
  I'm trying to save you. 
  What are you talking about? 
  When we were kids, do you remember how Mrs. 
  Washington would tell us these stories about how this famous author used to live in the building when it was first built? 
  Maybe. 
  Mrs. 
  Washington would tell us a lot of stories. 
  Yeah, well, that author's name was Hildegarde H. 
  Swift. 
  We think that Swift wrote her book while living in apartment 4D. 
  Dad knew the building could be declared a historical landmark and no one would be able to tear it down. 
  The new buyers wouldn't want it anymore. 
  That's why he had the apartment renovated. 
  - But that's fraud. 
  - Yes, it is. 
  But lucky for him, his name wasn't on the paperwork. 
  I-I can't believe he would do that to me. 
  You said that I couldn't save the building, and you're right, but I believe you can. 
  But you need to stand up to him, and not for me and not for the people in that building, but for you. 
  What if I can't? 
  I think you can. 
  We have a meeting. 
  Let's go. 
  [SOMBER MUSIC] 
  Are you coming? 
  You go ahead. 
  I'll be right there. 
  I still haven't heard from my sister. 
  I can't believe I have to break the news to everyone again. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I'm sorry. 
  I wish we could have been more help. 
  No, are you kidding me? 
  You guys did everything you could. 
  I really appreciate it. 
  Thank you. 
  Well, it was our pleasure, William. 
  Thank you so much for coming on such short notice, but I wanted to deliver this in person. 
  It brings me great sadness to tell you that we couldn't save the building. 
  I'm sorry I let you all down. 
  [STAMMERS] 
  What are you doing here? 
  I have to speak to my tenants. 
  The floor's yours. 
  Hello, everyone. 
  It has come to my attention that the buyers have received an anonymous tip that this building might be a historical landmark. 
  And since they can't tear it down, they no longer see the same value in the property. 
  They've decided to walk away from the deal. 
  So where does that leave us? 
  With a new buyer one that my father just sold to an hour ago. 
  And I have it on good authority that the new owner of the building has no intention of evicting anyone. 
  [CROWD MURMURING HAPPILY] 
  Wait, wait, how do you know? 
  Well, because I'm the new owner, and no one is going anywhere. 
  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
  [UPBEAT MUSIC] 
  Wait, so so you actually did it? 
  - You stood up to Dad. 
  - Thanks to you. 
  So what did he say? 
  He told me that when the old tenants at 4D were moving out, they found an old photograph of a woman sitting at a typewriter by the window. 
  Hildegarde H. 
  Swift. 
  Dad destroyed the photo never one to take chances. 
  He renovated the entire apartment for good measure. 
  And he just told you all this? 
  I was very persuasive, and as part of our agreement and staying silent, he sold me the building at a family rate. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  - [CARA LAUGHS] 
  You blackmailed Dad. 
  [BOTH LAUGH] 
  Well, to be honest, I think he was proud. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  Okay. 
  Well, now that the building isn't being sold, are you guys still interested in the apartment? 
  Oh. 
  The idea of family represents something different to all of us. 
  - Welcome. 
  - For some, it's the community of people who depend on you for strength and guidance. 
  Good morning. 
  All of what I know I am so happy you came. 
  So am I. 
  I'm not sure what I'm getting myself into or everything that Reverend Finer's life entails, but I'm ready to find out. 
  I can only hear [BOTH LAUGH] 
  For others, it's the unbreakable bond between a brother and a sister. 
  - I am proud of you, Miles. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  76 happily-ever-afters? 
  You've outdone yourself. 
  So have you heard anything about your apartment? 
  No, nothing yet. 
  Why? 
  Are you trying to get rid of me already? 
  No, no, no, no, it's just, uh, Cara had mentioned when her apartment was getting fumigated, they gave her two weeks' notice, not a day. 
  What's going on, sis? 
  Dee and I got into a huge fight, and I just needed some space at least that's what I thought. 
  But having this time to clear my head, really think about things Dee is an amazing person, but I I just don't think she's the right one for me. 
  Well, I'm sorry. 
  For what? 
  For not asking you. 
  You have always been there for me, always known what I was going through and how to help. 
  I'm lucky to have you. 
  I'm glad you feel that way, because you're gonna be happy to have me a little while longer. 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  And, yes, sometimes those family bonds can get fractured or even forgotten, but as long as you never give up on them, you can always find your way back. 
  It's just a housewarming gift. 
  - Thank you. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  I know moving back here is crazy, but this building is the only place that's ever made me feel like I'm at home, and I've missed that. 
  I've missed you. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Find my peace, love I feel - Hey, how's Ali? 
  - She's holding up. 
  Thanks for coming by to cheer her up. 
  Yeah. 
  And bringing more ice cream than anyone could ever possibly eat in a night. 
  Trust me, that's the point. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Oh. 
  - Got you a little something. 
  - What? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  "The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge. 
  " First edition. 
  Just a little God Account case closed gift. 
  Wait. 
  We're doing that now? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Thank you, Miles. 
  No worries. 
  I actually gave it a read. 
  It's not bad. 
  You know, you're like the best fake boyfriend I've ever had. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'm supposed to be gorging myself on ice cream as you people tell me it's all going to be okay. 
  Or do we not remember the plan? 
  Oh, no, we remember. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  - Thank you. 
  - Uh-huh. 
  [KNOCKING AT DOOR] 
  All I see is how I could change it all - Oh, hey. 
  - Hi. 
  Find my peace, love I feel What's up? 
  Rakesh Singh, Head of Mobile App Design. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Can't believe it! 
  - Congratulations again, bro. 
  - Thank you, man. 
  You'll be coding for a living now. 
  See? 
  I told you. 
  You thought they were onto what you've been doing. 
  They were. 
  It's how I got the job. 
  Look, don't ask me. 
  I'm Head of Mobile App Design. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  - Is that ice cream for me? 
  - No. 
  Okay. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'm gonna have it anyway. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  - Come on And if you're lucky, the family you have and the family you find become one in the same. 
  To a new state of mind
