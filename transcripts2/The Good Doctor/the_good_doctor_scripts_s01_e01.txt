 Autism... a mental condition characterized by difficulty in communicating and using language and abstract concepts.    
 That's the definition.    
 Does it sound like I'm describing a surgeon?    
 He's not Rain Man.    
 He's high functioning, he's capable of living on his own, capable of managing his own affairs.    
 "High functioning"?    
 Is that our new hiring standard?    
 If it were, you wouldn't be here.    
 I'm sorry. Is this really necessary? Really?

 You've wanted his job since day one.    
 Everyone in this room knows that.    
 And, Aaron, yes, this is your hospital.    
 But the money it takes to run it comes from the Foundation I control.

 Stop acting like you're stunned that you're standing there.    
 You tried to slip one past us.

 So justify your decision.

 I met Shaun Murphy when he was    years old.    
 I was living in Wyoming at the time.    
 He was, and he still is, an extraordinary young man.    
 Yes, he has autism, but he also has savant syndrome...genius-level skills in several areas.    
 He has almost perfect recall. 
He has spatial intelligence.    
 And he sees things and analyzes things in ways that... that are just remarkable.     
 In ways that we can't even begin to understand.     
 Those are assets. Undeniable assets for any doctor, particularly a surgeon.     
 You've known him since he was   ?     
 You care about him. 
He's like a son to you.

 Great.

 Yeah?     
 Why were you rude to me when we first met, then nicer to me the second time we met,

 The vote was clear. 
Why are we reopening this?     
 Is it really because of a piece of publicity?     
 It's because the man just saved somebody's life.     
 And thank God for that, but it doesn't change a single thing we discussed.     
 Glassman: Give him six months.     
 If he proves anything less than excellent...     
 Someone "less than excellent" means someone else dies.     
 Well, I-I would love to make you happy, Doctor.     
 I would love to hire someone who never, ever makes a mistake.     
 Unfortunately, God already has a job.
