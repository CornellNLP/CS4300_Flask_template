 (BIRDS CHIRPING)   
 I got you a doughnut.   
 Apparently.   
 What are you doing today?   
 My (SIGHS) least favorite thing in the world.   
 Looking for an apartment?   
 Yeah, I'll be out of here in    hours,   
 for both of our sakes.   
 What about your old apartment?    
 Kenny got arrested,    
 so I don't think he needs it anymore.    
 I don't think being neighbors is such a great idea.    
 We had a fight.    
 I bought you a doughnut.    
 A really big fight about some really big issues    
 that aren't gonna go away because you got me a doughnut.    
 ♪    
 (LAUGHS)    
 Remember that Usher-themed party I had?    
 I remember searching the entire house for a TYLENOL.    
 Is it too late to apologize for that?    
 No. Never.    
 (CHUCKLES)    
 I miss you, Daddy.    
 Who are you talking to?    
 I'm talking to...    
 To the chair?    
 If you can't fall asleep on your own,    
 you can have that Ambien you've been asking for.    
 MADDIE: You sleep, I go away.    
 I don't need an Ambien.    
 NURSE: Okay.    
 I'll be keeping an eye on you, Dr. Glassman.    
 Trying to hop a fence, Mac?    
 I wanna go home.    
 We will, sweetie, as soon as we fix you up.    
 Mac has Fragile X Syndrome.    
 A genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability,    
 behavioral issues, and hyperactivity.    
 The good news is that the picket hasn't compromised    
 any vital organs, major nerves, or arteries.    
 The bad news is that it splintered inside his shoulder.    
 Oh, let's get this stick out of you, Mac.    
 - Will it hurt? 
- Not a bit.    
 You're gonna sleep through the whole thing.

 Short for "Sybil."    
 She likes things nice and simple.    
 (METAL CLANGS, RATTLES)    
 Possible internal bleeding, heel bone calcaneus fractures,    
 tibial pilon fractures, and cervical fractures.    
 Her name's Kitty Kwon.    
 Hey, Kitty. You know where you are?    
 Unfortunately, yeah.    
 I was     feet from the summit.    
 Would've been the first female free solo.    
 Free solo?    
 Climbing without ropes.    
 (MONITOR BEEPING)    
 DR. MELENDEZ: Let's tidy up these bleeders, irrigate the wound,    
 and close him up.    
 SHAUN: How do you find a new friend?    
 Lea is very mad at me.    
 Well, whatever you did to her, apologize.    
 I did. I said, "I'm sorry."    
 It may take even more than that.    
 Make a statement. Go big.    
 DR. MELENDEZ: An apology's an apology.    
 If she doesn't accept it, just walk away.    
 And there we have the entire spectrum of male response...    
 Dazzle them or dump them.    
 Just be nice to her, Dr. Murphy.

 I don't like you looking like this.

 with one of my famous ties.    
 I had more ties than birthdays.    
 How did that happen?    
 - You know what's funny? 
- What?    
 I only have great memories of you.    
 What about all those other memories?    
 Why can't I remember them?    
 Good memories are like a beautiful song.    
 You don't want them to ever end.

 SHAUN: The surgery went very well.    
 We got every bit of picket, and Mac is recovering nicely.    
 - Oh, thank you. 
- He should be able to go home today.    
 This is all good news, Nicole.    
 I know. I know. I was... I was just...

 - Mom. Dad. 
- Thank God you're alive.     
 Thank you.     
 Unfortunately, there's still a serious issue     
 we have to deal with. Kitty has cervical fractures.     
 She broke her neck.     
 Luckily, we can repair it by fusing her spine.     
 Your range of motion will be restricted,     
 but when everything else heals,     
 you should be walking within three months.     
 Will I be able to climb again?     
 Not at that level, and certainly not free solo.     
 They should've just left me on that mountain to die.     
 Then I think you'll prefer the second option...     
 The Odontoid Screw Procedure.     
 It doesn't involve vertebral fusion     
 and could maintain your full range of motion.     
 Seriously? Sign me up!     
 The spinal fusion surgery is generally preferred     
 because it has higher healing rates     
 and more favorable long-term results.     
 But the screw procedure's less invasive,     
 so there's reduced collateral injury     
 and no permanent damage.     
 Would she be able to climb again?     
 Free solo? Everything?     
 Eventually, yes.     
 Can I say yes now?     
 Yes! (CHUCKLES)     
 No.

 Give him away? To strangers?     
 To professionals who can help him.     
 He was abandoned by his father.     
 I'm all that he has left.     
 God, he was such a beautiful baby.     
 And he was perfectly normal, walking, talking...     
 But just after he turned two,     
 we noticed a change.     
 He started to lose his words. He was going backwards.     
 When we got the test results,     
 everything we'd hoped for our perfect, little boy was...     
 Was gone.     
 By the time he was nine, he was too much for my husband.     
 (SCOFFS) And that was before his growth spurt     
 and before his mood swings became...     
 (SCOFFS)     
 I don't want to give him up. I... I just...     
 I just wanted a break for one lousy night.     
 Nobody blames you for that, Nicole.     
 And you don't have to send your son anywhere.     
 I'm sure that'd be devastating for a kid like Mac.

 Yes, it would.     
 Then he'd get used to it.     
 It started with a broken arm and a concussion.     
 The next time, it was a shattered femur and a ruptured spleen,     
 then a broken pelvis,     
 then a skull fracture     
 that put her into a coma for three days.     
 She needs this crazy... fix.     
 I'm not an adrenaline junkie!     
 Okay, when I climb, adrenaline is the enemy.     
 I need to be calm, relaxed, and focused, or this happens.     
 You've always wanted me to believe I can do anything I want.     
 Each time that I summit, every roadblock in my life melts away.     
 It's what I live for.

 why I'm not sitting here for real, holding my father's hand.     
 Good dreams, please. Good dreams.     
 You want good dreams?     
 Go ahead. Take your pill.     
 This has got to happen, Daddy. You know it.     
 What if they're right? 
What if we are, in effect,     
 killing their daughter by giving her the surgery she wants?     
 These are not issues doctors should think about.     
 That's what we tell ourselves     
 because it makes it easier for us to just do our job     
 and not worry about whether we're helping or hurting.     
 For all we know, on her next climb,     
 she may meet her soul mate.

 If, on the other hand,     
 you're not God and, like the rest of us,

 brought on by lack of sleep, but, as you know,

 risks that reduce their lifespan,     
 every time they get into a car or they smoke a cigarette.     
 We're all doing the same thing,     
 just calculating our chances and hoping we defy the odds.     
 What about when you took the sleeping pills?     
 It was four years ago, after I'd been dumped on Twitter.     
 And I'd called my parents as soon as I had done it.

 She'll be able to enjoy an active and safe lifestyle.     
 That minor impairment could be as much     
 as a   % restriction of head rotation

 That's worst-case scenario.     
 It's a permanent disability.
