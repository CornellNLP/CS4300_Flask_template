 Previously on "The Good Doctor"...   
 Dr. Coyle... He's a little too friendly.   
 I'm sure he's just trying to establish a rapport.   
 COYLE: I give great massages.   
 And I'll make a killer omelet in the morning.   
 That's really inappropriate. I said no.   
 You're approaching insubordination.   
 JARED: You have to file a complaint with HR.   
 They will shift the blame onto me. Like you did.    
 I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.    
 So, why do I need to quit my job to have a family?    
 Agreed. She can be a great lawyer and a great mom.    
 I don't want to have kids.    
 SHAUN: I don't need a therapist.    
 - I want to make my own decisions. 
- I am done talking.    
 - Now let's go. 
- No. N-No.    
 - I don't want help! 
- MELISSA: Where would he go?    
 Is there a place he likes to hang out?    
 I mean, he's not at the hospital.    
 And there used to be a picture here.    
 It means he's not coming back.    
 [KNOCK ON DOOR]    
 Hi. Good morning.    
 I'm Aaron Glassman. Dr. Glassman.    
 I work with Shaun.    
 Hi. Nice to meet you.    
 It's nice to meet you, too. 
May I speak with him, please?    
 Uh, Shaun isn't here.    
 I know you've been helping Shaun, and I appreciate that,    
 but I really need to speak with him immediately.    
 I'll definitely let him know when I see him next.    
 I'm... I'm sorry.    
 - What the hell are you doing? 
- Shaun, I know you're in here.    
 I just... I just want to talk, please.    
 You are way out of line.    
 Shaun, you have responsibilities.    
 We've got to sort this out.    
 You have five seconds to get the hell out of here...    
 - Shaun. 
- ...or I'm calling the police.    
 - Shaun, I just... 
- What are...    
 I just want to...    
 - Five... 
- Shaun.    
 Shaun, she's calling the police.    
 - ...four... 
- Is that what you want?    
 LEA: ...three...    
 - ...two... 
- Okay, okay.    
 - ...one. 
- Okay, okay, I'm leaving.    
 It's just that Shaun has a-a tendency    
 to run away from conflict.    
 And in Casper and medical school,    
 people will give you a little bit of slack, but it...    
 now he's in a very hard-to-get job    
 in a very competitive environment    
 where people do not give you a second chance.    
 Still, not cool.    
 If you speak with him [CLEARS THROAT]    
 will you call me, please?    
 Out.    
 Yeah.

 I gotta say, he seems like a nebby, old jerk.

 Nosey. It's a Pittsburgh thing.    
 I mean, you're a grown man.    
 If you don't want to talk to him, it's none of his business.    
 San Jose is too big.    
 I get not liking San Jose.    
 I'm not the biggest fan myself, but...    
 I don't want to see a therapist.    
 So don't.    
 I should go back to Casper.    
 I have a rule.    
 Never  make an important decision while you are angry,    
 upset, high, or right before or after having s*x.    
 Okay, you are overworked, stressed out,    
 and pissed off at your boss.    
 Now is not the time to be making a big decision.    
 You need to take a break, clear your head.    
 You need a vacation.    
 I have to work five more months before I earn a vacation.    
 So call in sick.    
 I'm not sick.    
 [SIGHS] You're so adorable.    
 You don't have to  be  sick to call in sick.    
 Ah, I have so much to teach you, Grasshopper.    
 And I'm gonna start with a good, old-fashioned road trip.    
 It's the perfect way to get your mojo back.    
 And when we return, you're gonna know exactly what to do    
 about San Jose, therapy, and Glassy the Grouch.    
 And all you have to do

 Wrong day to be late. We're already shorthanded.

- I did not fire Kalu.     
 And if you have a problem with it, talk to Andrews.     
 Although, if you want my advice, don't have a problem with it.     
 Andrews is waiting to brief us on a new case.     
 It's a kidney transplant on craniopagus twins.     
 Conjoined?     
 They're connected at the skull.     
 Their entire renal-vascular systems are interdependent.     
 Cool.     
 Hey. Have either of you talked to Shaun?     
 - No. 
- No, which isn't unusual.     
 Is anything wrong?     
 No, no, not with Shaun. It's a family emergency.     
 - He's gonna be out for a few days. 
- He's supposed to get approval     
 for any personal days from his attending.     
 Right, which is why I'm checking in.

 Wherever the car takes us.

 there is a single brain mass.     
 That's why all their previous neurosurgeons
