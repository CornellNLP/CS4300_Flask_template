 Hello. 
 Gretchen's father is very upset. 
 It seems you talked her out of the surgery. 
 No, I didn't talk her out of it     or talk her anywhere. 
 I just gave her the list of potential risks. 
 Embolism, hemorrhage, collateral paralysis,     - asymmetry, brain damage, and stroke.

 Yes, there was a case in Brazil in     ,     - and the patient suffer... 
 - [STAMMERS] 
 It seems that you don't believe     that restoring this girl's smile is that important. 
 Smiles are overvalued. 
 There are studies that support that. 
 And there are studies that don't. 
 When we smile, we produce endorphins. 
 They make us happy. 
 They make other people happy. 
 When we see smiles,     our basotemporal lobes are activated,     and we duplicate what we see. 
 Murphy, smiles are contagious. 
 You see? 
 I feel good, you feel good... 
 Everybody likes smiles. 
 I don't. 
 In any case, your smile wasn't sincere     since it didn't demonstrate the Duchenne Marker... 
 There was no involvement of the orbicularis oculi muscles     around the eyes,     which means you didn't release endorphins. 
 You know, if you can talk her     out of a surgery she's wanted for years,     I'm pretty sure a conversation with someone objective     can talk her back into it.
