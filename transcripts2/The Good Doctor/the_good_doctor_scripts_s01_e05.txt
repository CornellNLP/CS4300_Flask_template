 Nonsensical questions usually imply sarcasm,

 Good one.    
 Trauma wants a consult on a   -year-old male    
 who collapsed from severe anaphylaxis,    
 complicated by respiratory arrest.    
 His son just got back from Thailand.    
 Almost immediately, the father had his allergic reaction.    
 MERRILL: [GROANING]    
 Patient has a few allergies...    
 pollen, mold, shellfish...    
 but no corresponding allergens were in evidence.    
 Why are we doing a surgical consult on an allergy?    
 Well, we're not. We're doing a consult    
 on the excruciating abdominal pain he now has.    
 [GROANING LOUDLY]    
 As you may have heard.    
 Mr. Wilks, hi, I'm Dr. Neil Melendez.

 The guy was in some serious pain...    
    milligrams of morphine worth.    
 Test results show elevated lipase,    
 amylase, pancreatic enzymes.    
 Pancreas is enlarged.    
 Could be pancreatitis, maybe alcohol-induced.    
 The son said he smelled alcohol on his father    
 at  :   in the morning.    
 And anaphylaxis has been known to precipitate    
 attacks of pancreatitis.    
 Guess that's it, then.    
 Meaning you totally disagree.    
 Not everyone who starts their day off with a Mimosa    
 fries their pancreas.    
 Your eyesight must a hell of a lot better than mine.    
 Because I can't see the entire pancreas    
 due to the overlying bowel gas.    
 We'll order an abdominal CT and take a better look.    
 There you go.    
 Where the hell is Murphy?    
 It's a severe fracture,    
 but I don't think you'll need pins.    
 Young bones tend to heal very well.    
 Young Bones? Isn't that a "Star Trek: Origins" graphic novel?

 No, that was a joke.

 Of course, it was right in front of Shelby Lomar.     
 At least it was pretty gross,     
 so I got some sympathy points for that.     
 I would expect this to have been caused     
 by a more serious accident.     
 Nope, just a trip.

 So what's that mean?     
 When you fell, did you hit your head?     
 No.     
 What, you think I have brain damage?     
 Nystagmus  can  be a sign of a neurological issue.     
 Oh.     
 Well, that would explain the "C" I got in social studies.     
 That was another joke, wasn't it?     
 Mm.

 She was another teacher at the school.     
 A Thai woman.     
 And she was kind and...

 This a bad time?     
 No, come in.     
 According to the CT,     
 you have a lesion on your pancreas.     
 Well, what do you think this lesion could be?     
 Not sure.     
 That's why we need to biopsy it.     
 It could just be a benign cyst.

 Tough to tell without looking at you,

 No. I have autism,

 which is linked to Langerhans cell histiocytosis,     
 which causes osteolytic lesions     
 in the long bones of the upper limbs.     
 And those lesions could be misdiagnosed     
 as signs of osteosarcoma.     
 - Yes. 
- What about his brain tumor?     
 Langerhans can also manifest 
in the skull.     
 Instead of a death sentence,     
 he could have something that could easily     
 be treated with prednisone?     
 Next, we need to do a bone-marrow aspiration to confirm.     
 I assume you've looked at his file.     
 For a very long time.     
 Well, there must've been a biopsy.     
 What did the pathology report say?     
 Yes. There were two biopsies.     
 Both were positive for osteosarcoma.     
 - Murphy... 
- They could be false positives.     
 Do you have any idea how unlikely it is     
 to have two false positives?     
  . %.     
 Which we can comfortably round off to "not likely."     
 It is possible...     
 Yes, but it means telling the parents of a dying child     
 that there's hope, when really there isn't.     
 Grab a shower and get ready for rounds.

 Of course.
