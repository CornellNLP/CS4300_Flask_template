 MAN:  Previously on The Good Doctor...   
 Shaun, I have cancer.   
 I have to undergo brain surgery, which is really scary.   
 To be clear, Jared, I don't want you here.   
 I fought for my job.   
 You compromised your integrity.   
 My former mentor is head of the surgical residency program   
 at Denver Memorial Hospital.

 DR. ANDREWS: A surgeon needs to communicate.    
 Can Dr. Murphy do that? 
Can he do that under stress?    
 Can he do that    
 knowing that a human life literally hangs in the balance?    
 Shaun?    
 DR. GLASSMAN:  If Shaun proves anything less than excellent,   
 I will resign my position as president of this hospital.    
 I know why Caden has DIC.    
 It was my mistake.    
 I have to tell Dr. Andrews about the mistake I made.    
 Shaun, you can't.    
 I'm not gonna ask him to lie to save my job.

 SHAUN: Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.    
 I'm a surgical resident    
 at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.    
 So, what did Andrews have to say to you?    
 DR. ANDREWS:  Shaun.   
 You've exceeded my expectations    
 in terms of expertise and technical execution.    
 But your communication skills are sorely lacking.    
 That has to change    
 if you want to stay here at St. Bonaventure.    
 He told me I exceeded expectations.    
 Great.    
 - Sounds, uh, sounds great, Shaun. 
- Yes.    
 I think you should have gone to your review.    
 Since it's my last day,    
 not much opportunity to make use of the feedback.    
 Dr. Andrews could have some wisdom    
 that you could use in Denver at your next job.    
 (CHUCKLES)    
 Even if I did care about his opinion,    
 it was made pretty obvious by the fact that we're here.    
 This is Glassman's project.    
 Andrews thinks it's a money trap.    
 ♪    
 How'd your review go, Claire?    
 Went well.    
 Andrews said I connected nicely,    
 that I care about people.    
 Interesting.    
 I'd have thought he'd want you to be more aggressive.    
 I think you need to be more assertive, Dr. Browne.    
 ♪    
 Okay. (CHUCKLES)    
 Nope.    
 Hmm.    
 What'd he say about you?    
 Figure out how to be a little less self-centered    
 and realize you're part of a team?    
 You're sometimes overbearing.    
 Often egotistical.    
 You need to be more of a team player.    
 Mmm.

- DR. MELENDEZ: Melanie Arnott.    
 The patient has pulmonary hypertension.    
 The only treatment is medication,    
 which reduces the lung blood pressure, but not enough.    
 Her heart's failing due to the extra strain.    
 That is a factually-correct diagnosis.    
 What about a fix?    
 Isn't it just a... Transplant?    
 Nope.    
 (PROJECTOR BEEPS)    
 There's nothing inherently wrong with Melanie's heart.    
 It's healthy. Just needs a little bit of help.    
 So, we're gonna leave her current heart inside

 Would you rather we continue to discuss this inside?     
 We are discussing things with the patient     
 that are potentially sensitive, so...     
 We're done with the patient.     
 Did Andrews happen to speak to you about communication?     
 (HORN HONKS)     
 Yes.     
 I'm trying very hard.     
 It's definitely something you should work on.     
 Things might be different, more difficult for you,     
 now Glassman's not around, so...     
 Dr. Glassman is still around.     
 He's alive and he is not going to die.     
 He's meeting his oncologist today.     
 You...     
 You didn't go with him?     
 No.     
 That would be stupid.     
 I am a resident.     
 I don't know as much about brain cancer     
 as a double board certified neuro-oncologist.     
 True, but this has got to be challenging     
 for him emotionally.     
 I can't help him.     
 Emotionally.

 Excuse me, please.     
 Thank you for keeping me waiting.     
 We doctors are busy, important people.     
 Yeah, we doctors are.     
 So, pre-op clearance, surgery,     
 radiation, and chemo.     
 We're gonna have a lot of fun.     
 I hope you don't mind if I start with pre-op.

 I'm clean.     
 I miss it, but I'm clean.     
 They test me every week now.     
 Good.     
 I think you had me reinstated as your last official act     
 before they booted you as president     
 because I am the best oncologist around     
 and you would like to get the best treatment.     
 Yeah.     
 So, I'd like to ensure that the brain,     
 in this instance, my brain,     
 stays as dry as possible during surgery,     
 maintain minimal swelling.     
 I would still like to be able to swing my  -iron when we're done here.     
 Of course, it's also possible that you had me reinstated     
 because you'd like an oncologist who thinks they owe you     
 and you want to push them around.     
 Look, Dr. Blaize,     
 I am, like any other patient,     
 entitled to have a say in my own treatment,     
 but unlike any other patient,     
 I have spent my entire adult life

 As I explained to Elliot and Melanie,     
 the press attention is a necessary element     
 for funding this surgery.     
 But as you didn't explain to them,     
 it's simultaneously a vanity project     
 to create buzz for your new presidency.

 this surgery can change the way     
 our entire hospital is perceived.
