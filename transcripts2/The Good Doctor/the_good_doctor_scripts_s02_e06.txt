 Morning, roomie.   
 I'm going to the market later. You need more apples?   
 No, but we need more toilet paper.

 The paper goes over on the top, not under hanging against the wall.

 We heard you hurt your finger.    
 Can we take a look?    
 I got a crappy manicure a couple days ago, and now my nail looks disgusting.    
 Paronychia... it's an abscess caused by a common bacterial infection.    
 We'll drain it, pack it, and send you home.    
 In    hours, the pain and swelling will be much better, and you'll be back to Paganini.

 Not your first nosebleed, huh, Dad?    
 Well, these things usually go away on their own, but Riley claims she's been like this for over an hour.    
 Ugh! It's not a claim, it's a fact!

 I have my premiere at Davies this weekend, hence the manicure.    
 Rosin, beeswax... that stuff is tough to get off.

 I dabbled in archery when I was in high school.

 She shouldn't have any pain in her finger.    
 It's not my finger.    
 It's further up, by my knuckle.    
 - [THERMOMETER BEEPING] 
- No fever.    
 Any body aches?    
 Uh, a little.    
 Playing violin all day stresses out my neck and shoulders.    
 It's likely tendonitis or mild arthritic pain.    
 Or it might be flesh-eating bacteria and we have may have to cut off your finger.    
 There's the bleeder, at the posterior rim of Kiesselbach's plexus.    
 You called    ?    
 She did.    
 How you feeling, baby?    
 Peachy.    
 It's a nosebleed. I'm handling it.    
 She's my kid, too, Bruce.    
 Bet you couldn't tell they're divorced.    
 PARK: Well, why don't I take Riley's parents to the waiting room so we can...     
 Talk about me.     
 Adiós.     
 We need to know.     
 Shaun, what do we need to do to know for sure?     
 We need to cut deeper and get a swab.     
 Fingers have thousands of nerve endings.     
 Clipping off even the tiniest portion of Jas's finger could cause permanent damage and be career-ending.     
 But if it is necrotizing fasciitis and we do nothing, she could die.     
 That would also end her career.     
 True.     
 But the numbers, Shaun, the data.     
 There's almost no chance that it's nec fasc.     
 On the other hand, if we test for it, we will definitely do damage.     
 Anything else?     
 Do you hang your toilet paper going over or under?     
 Doesn't matter.     
 STELLA: Before the nosebleeds, it was tummy aches, insomnia, breathing pain.     
 Every time, we'd rush her to the pediatrician, but they couldn't find anything, so we stopped taking her.     
 You think she's faking it?     
 A therapist said it was likely her subconscious way of trying to get her family back together.     
 Well, divorce isn't easy for adults.     
 Why should kids be able to deal with it any better?     
 She disengaged, not just from us, but her friends, school.     
 It's been five years.     
 She should have found her new normal by now.     
 [SIGHS]     
 Looks like someone's doing better.     
 Nosebleed stopped, but Riley's nasal membranes are pretty thin.     
 You should be on the lookout for future bleeds.     
 Riley, have you been sniffing or snorting any drugs lately?     
 What? No way. I wouldn't do that.     
 There's a lot of stuff out there that looks harmless,     
 - but... 
- She said no.     
 Does FLONASE count?     
 I was coughing.     
 I had a stuffy nose, itchy throat.     
 I looked up my symptoms, because what the hell else was I supposed to do?     
 Vasomotor rhinitis fit.     
 So I went to the drug store, and I got some FLONASE.     
 Misuse of steroid sprays can thin out nasal membranes, causing terrible nosebleeds.     
 Quit the FLONASE, you're good to go.     
 Thank you.     
 Uh, I need you to take her tonight.     
 I had to skip a pitch to an important V.C. to get here.     
 Sorry, didn't mean to take you away from anything important.     
 You're provoking her. 
You know she's an anxious kid.     
 I'm not anxious, I'm sick.     
 Could you for once have my back?     
 - What?

 That is a pretty unique diagnosis for an  th grader.     
 You'll be numb in a minute.

 And I was wrong.     
 Doesn't matter.

 You were smart, popular.     
 We don't have anything in common.     
 I was never popular.

 I wouldn't send my worst enemy back to junior high.     
 I got so many D's on my report card last year, I got held back.     
 Now everyone treats me like I'm stupid.     
 It's humiliating. [INHALES SHARPLY]     
 How'd you deal with it?     
 I said screw it.     
 They already think I'm bad.     
 I mess around in class, leave campus, do whatever the hell I want.     
 But you're still angry.     
 I didn't let my past define me...     
 and yours doesn't have to define you.     
 Repeating a grade doesn't make you...     
 What?     
 What's wrong?     
 Nothing.     
 There doesn't seem to be any active bleeding.     
 But I coughed up blood. That was real.     
 It's possible it's just post-nasal aspiration... that the blood you coughed up was from the initial nosebleed,     
 and it went down your throat, into your lungs.     
 But my chest, it really hurts.
