 Good news. I have a VIP who needs a multiple ligament   
 reconstruction on his elbow, and I've got room   
 for a couple residents to assist me and Dr. Melendez.   
 Awesome.   
 I've never assisted on one of those before.   
 Dr. Andrews knows that.   
 That's why he's acting like it's Christmas morning.   
 I'm guessing you've never operated   
 on a pro athlete, either.    
 [JARED CLEARS THROAT] Um, last time I checked,    
 a "couple" means "two," and there's three of us.    
 More good news.    
 Whoever isn't with us will be assisting Dr. Coyle    
 on a double-leg fasciotomy.
