 Deep brain stimulation was used to treat anorexia.   
 You want to use brain surgery for a psychiatric disorder?    
 DBS isn't FDA-approved for anorexia treatment here.    
 It's not a real option.    
 My wife's decided against the valve-repair surgery, at least until she's tried the deep brain stimulation.    
 You won't be a part of the surgery.    
 Or any of my surgeries.    
 You went around me, directly to the patient.

 Hey, um...    
 Um, my college roommate was diagnosed with stage   ovarian cancer a year ago.    
 She's had six cycles of Carbo-Taxol without cyto-reductive surgery due to widespread disease.    
 They stopped chemo when she stopped responding.    
 She has a month at most.    
 Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that, Claire.    
 As am I.    
 And I assume you're not here just seeking sympathy.    
 I have reviewed her scans and she can't be cured, but this metastatic lesion extending through her diaphragm is causing most of her pain.    
 Her surgeon has ruled out removing it due to vascular complexity.    
 But I think laparoscopic debulking is possible.    
 Difficult, but possible.    
 I know you're upset with me, but sh-she's my friend and she's in pain.    
 I need your help.

 I'd remove as much tumor as possible, and then we'd infuse your abdomen with a chemotherapy solution for    minutes.

 Donation carries several risks, including blood clots, infection, hemorrhage,  lung collapse, and possibly death.     
 There are also lifelong risks, such as high blood pressure, which can cause a heart attack, and protein-losing nephropathy, which can impair your remaining kidney, leading to the need fora transplant yourself.

 Redemption, meaning, sure, but not money.
