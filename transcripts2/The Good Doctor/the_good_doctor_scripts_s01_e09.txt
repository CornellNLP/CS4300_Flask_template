 Very nice meeting you.   
 ♪   
 So, who was that?   
 A housekeeper.   
 Leaving your place at  :   in the morning?   
 I was interviewing her.   
 You're hiring a housekeeper for a studio apartment?   
 I'm not hiring her.    
 Her clothes don't match.    
 Right.    
 Mm.    
 You're such an asshat, Shaun Murphy.

 [Door opens]    
 [Door closes]    
 Today we realize a dream...    
 seeing our international humanitarian program    
 come to fruition.    
 Our cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. Neil Melendez,    
 in consultation with our head cardiologist, Dr. Avi Mehta,    
 evaluated children from Tanzania to Malawi to Guinea.    
 They screened over     candidates,    
 each of them needing life-saving surgeries.    
 Ultimately, we decided on a particularly inspiring young boy    
 named Gabriel,    
 who hails from the Democratic Republic of Congo,    
 with severe congenital heart anomalies.    
 [Applause]    
 We identified three perfect candidates...    
 - children I can actually help. 
- Hi. Thank you.    
 - Gabriel wasn't one of them. 
- Yes and no.    
 I signed off on your choices.    
 But I wouldn't have necessarily eliminated Gabriel    
 based on the echo I saw.    
 A non-surgeon undermining a surgeon    
 on his selection of surgical candidates.    
 It's healthy when colleagues challenge each others' decisions.    
 It doesn't make any sense.    
 We gave you good candidates.    
 You're not a doctor. Why wouldn't you stick with the list?    
 There were several intangibles.    
 ♪    
 Can you say hi to Dr. Melendez?    
 One of those intangibles, I'm guessing, is cuteness.

 Family displaced during the war.    
 Mother took care of her husband until he died of yellow fever.    
 He bled out at home.    
 A month later, Gabriel was born.    
 People tend to give more    
 when the cause is not only noble, but photogenic,    
 Adorable kids and sympathetic moms may work on donors,    
 but they won't work on me,    
 and they certainly won't work on echo results.    
 Kinda working on me.    
 Before you say no, at least do your own work-up.    
 Winnie:  Mommy, why can't I come?   
 The hospital's worried that children bring in germs.    
 I won't, Mommy. I promise.   
 I know, boo. It's just... It's the rules.    
 Okay, baby. I have to go now.    
 Do what Aunt Maggie says. I'll call you later, okay?    
 I love you to the moon...    
 And back.   
 I can't imagine voice rest    
 could be very easy with a  -year-old.    
 Yeah. Not very effective for my podcast audience either.    
 Of which, by the way, I'm a huge fan.    
 Grim irony, though, right?    
 A podcaster who loses her voice.    
 Elizabeth, I'm sure the nodule will be benign    
 and this'll be nothing more than an inspiration    
 for another great episode.    
 If it's not benign, Isabel?    
 Let's not get ahead of ourselves.    
 Today we're just focused on removing the nodule    
 and doing the biopsy.    
 And you've done everything you could do.    
 And when the hoarseness started,    
 you sought early care from the best.    
 And I sent you to the best.    
 You work perfectly together,

 Statistically, that is very unlikely

 Social interactions

 Why is that funny?

 It's just, um, some people

 So, how's it going with Lea?     
 She doesn't like me.     
 Claire: Why do you say that?     
 - She said I was an asshat. 
- Yeah?     
 What was she doing when she said that?     
 - Touching me. 
- She was flirting with you.     
 Sometimes people say the opposite of what they mean.     
 Um, they use teasing as a way     
 of saying something they don't mean     
 instead of saying something that they do.     
 I haven't seen any data on the use of antonyms     
 as a flirting technique.     
 Okay. Well, um, here's what to look for.

 Okay. The pretentious giggle.     
 [Giggles]     
 The, uh... the squirm.     
 And the hair sweep.     
 I call it the flirting trifecta.     
 Hair scuffing is used in both animals and humans, Claire.     
 Secreting glands are located in the scalp and fur.     
 Scuffing sends hormones out into the environment     
 to let a potential mate know they're interested.     
 Or it could be ringworm.     
 Yeah.     
 I suppose you have to factor for that possibility.     
 Nice touch.

 Happiness improves outlook.

 I love how everyone in surgery is so fast to blame the lab.     
 Well, double-checking can't hurt.     
 Actually it can.     
 Because you are here     
 when you should be double-checking surgery.     
 I saw the specimen go in the container.     
 It means it has to be here.     
 No, all that means is that it was put in a container.     
 It doesn't mean that that container     
 was actually put in the surgery refrigerator     
 or that it was actually picked up by the courier.     
 He's even worse than we thought.     
 Yeah.

 Maybe metoprolol.
