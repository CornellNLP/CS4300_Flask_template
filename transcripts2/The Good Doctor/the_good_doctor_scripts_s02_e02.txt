 Female genital mutilation     is the ritual cutting or removal of some, or all,     of the external female genitalia. 
 Over     million victims worldwide. 
 It is almost universally practiced     in a number of African and Asian countries.

 Wisconsin.

 Yeah, it's way more common here than you think.

 We're gonna do the labiaplasty first thing in the morning. 
 The damage done to her nerves is not going to get undone,     nor is the psych damage,     but at least she'll look like other girls. 
 We should be able to have her out of here     by  :   in the evening. 
 Outpatient? 
 Why the hurry? 
 So her mother will simply think she's in school,     then out studying with her friends. 
 She loves her parents and doesn't want to tell them     that she's rejecting one of their cultural traditions. 
 They won't stay in the dark for long,     since we're legally obligated to report them. 
 That "cultural tradition" also fits     - the definition of abuse. 
 - And they'll also find out when we ask     for their permission to do this surgery. 
 She's a minor. 
 Her ID says she's   . 
 Yes, her fake ID     says she's   . 
 Her number starts with an "H," which means she was born in the '  s. 
 Also, the photo background is green instead of blue. 
 - Also six other things. 
 - (SIGHS) 
 Maybe we can get Legal to get a court order... 
 If I believe that ID is real,     then I am entitled to perform this surgery     without seeking consent of anyone other than the patient. 
 And, as legally required within    hours,     I will report the evidence of abuse     under the name and address listed on that ID. 
 If the investigation of that report     doesn't begin until the girl is long gone     and happens to lead nowhere because the name wasn't real,     that's no fault of mine. 
 Are you sure you want to risk your medical license     to protect an abusive mother? 
 If we do this by the book,     we never see that girl again and no one gets help. 
 If we do this by the book, maybe the cops lock the parents up. 
 We shine a light on this thing, her community gets scared,     and maybe the next girl doesn't need our help. 
 Or maybe the testimony of the girl     about what happened to her when she was       doesn't help the cops at all. 
 Maybe the parents just take their daughter home,     and maybe we scare the next girl     into not even asking for help.

 I can't believe people ever lie. 
 There are so many questions     people might ask you,     but if you tell the truth,     you already know the answers. 
 And, also, it's wrong. 
 But sometimes,     you shouldn't tell the whole truth? 
 No. 
 Of course not. 
 Because that lets you be honorable     and tell the truth and be a good person,     but at the same time,     you get to completely deceive the person.

 There are no metastatic lesions, but there are     - local nodes involved. 
 - And there's partial encasement     of the superior mesenteric artery. 
 That puts it past the point     where we can cure with local resection. 
 We could do Whipple surgery. 
 That's not advised for stage III pancreatic cancer. 
 Not quite. 
 It's not advised for stage IV. 
 For stage III, it's discretionary.

 - In my discretion,     he's better off with    semi-comfortable months,     rather than running the risk of dying on the table tomorrow. 
 If he doesn't die on the table, he could have many years.

 Back to the bosom of her loving family. 
 We'd remove as much of the cancer as possible     by removing the head of the pancreas     and other attached organs,     but then, we'd have to reconstruct the anatomy. 
 The easiest way to do that     is to bring up a loop of jejunum... 
 Shaun. 
 Sorry. 
 The jejunum is part of the small intestine     between the duodenum and ileum. 
 It's complicated, very dangerous surgery. 
 And even if it's successful,     post-operative complications are frequent and serious.

 Not enough of his patients are dying? 
 No, Shaun, sometimes patients die. 
 Doesn't matter how good the doctor is.

 I've spoken with our legal department. 
 Unless we can prove the social worker was biased,     we are stuck with this ruling. 
 Well, then you're also stuck with "I won't do it."     You're a good doctor. 
 This hospital will miss you. 
 You're gonna fire me because I won't butcher a teenage girl? 
 Of course I am. 
 This hospital will face lawsuits, suspensions,     perhaps criminal charges,     and this little girl will still get the surgery you hate. 
 Could Dr. Lim at least talk to Mara again? 
 You want to wake her up again in pain? 
 Every woman deserves the right     to make decisions about her sexuality     without her parents hanging over her. 
 Okay.

 When I was    years old,     my father caught me with a boy. 
 I mean, we weren't doing it,     but my top was off and     Well, it doesn't matter. 
 My father hit me. 
 I still have a small scar. 
 Our relationship was never the same.

 Not everyone gets called a slut. 
 Not everyone gets butchered.
