 Olivia : Previously, on Cedar Cove...  
 I have a really good feeling about you two. 
 You want to be on a boat, fishing in Alaska, not fixing up a restaurant in Cedar Cove. 
 I'm going back to New York. 
 I want you to come with me. 
 You should have this. 
 Why do I need a key to your house? 
 [Crickets chirping] 
 [Dog barking] 
 [Music playing on stereo] 
 [♪ ♪ ♪] 
 May I help? 
 No. You make yourself comfortable. 
 I have everything under control. 
 You really outdid yourself. 
 Cloth napkins, new candles. 
 What makes you think those are new candles? 
 Price tag. 
 [Chuckles] Whoops. 
 So, I have to ask... 
 Umberto's or Morgan's? 
 Now, the steaks were definitely Umberto's, but I am not so sure about the potatoes. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I've been in here, slaving at the... 
 [Stammers, sighs] 
 Umberto's. 
 [Jack laughs] 
 I just wanted everything to be perfect. 
 So... 
 How are Eric and Shelly? 
 Well, Eric is working at Moon's, until he can find something better. 
 We've made a deal about paying rent while he's here. 
 That's smart. 
 Yeah. 
 It's not so much about the money as it is learning responsibility. 
 Hopefully, between rent and a job... 
 And a baby. 
 Yeah, and that, too. 
 Hopefully, he'll... 
 Well, I don't know... 
 Grow up? 
 [Laughs] That's the idea. 
 Here, let me top you up. 
 The service is excellent here. 
 Well... 
 Tipping is very much appreciated. 
 Mm. 
 And... 
 We have this. 
 What's that? 
 This is a bowling ball. 
 This is Moon's famous chocolate cake. 
 Go on, open it. 
 It's your key to my house. 
 The one I tried giving you yesterday. 
 It's not my key. It's your key. 
 Your house, your key. 
 I know you said you couldn't think of a reason to be in my house if I weren't in my house, but, you see, this got me thinking. 
 Stay with me here. 
 What if you're outside, I'm in here, being attacked by... you know, a bear or... something? 
 A bear? 
 These things happen. They do. 
 So, you see, I need you to take that key because, one day, I may need you to use it to save my life. 
 [Sighs] 
 Don't you want it? 
 [Door thuds, footsteps] 
 Are we interrupting? 
 Hey. 
 [♪ ♪ ♪] 
 Feel like we've been seeing a lot of each other. 
 Well, it's an old house, Grace. 
 One thing goes, it's sort of a domino effect. 
 Mm. Dominoes were a lot cheaper. 
 You have lead in your pipes. 
 $5,000? 
 So, Mr. Canner, the tree was a hardship for you? 
 That's why you cut it down? 
 It dropped leaves and branches all over my driveway and my car. 
 Plus, it was half-dead, and there were always kids in the tree. 
 I saved lives by cutting it down. 
 I have a map here from the town surveyor's office, indicating your home and driveway are quite a ways from the tree in question. 
 So... how did those dead branches and leaves make it to your property? 
 Was it a magical tree? 
 You know what I think? 
 Children make noise. 
 Happy, playful children tend to make a lot of noise. 
 You weren't trying to get rid of the tree, you were trying to get rid of the children who use the tree. 
 It may interest you to know is not the only person who's upset with you. 
 Was such a huge industry in the state of Washington, we have a little law on the books called the "Timber Trespass Statute," dates all the way back to 1869. 
 Long story short, if it can be proved that you did damage to another person's tree... which you have fully admitted here... 
 you can be held for treble... which means three times... 
 The value of the tree. 
 Now, I do a little gardening, Mr. Canner, and I can assure you, that the price of a fully-grown oak tree is... 
 Well, a lot! 
 But I think we can find a middle ground here, if it's agreeable with Mr. Lawrence. 
 Yeah. 
 Therefore I suggest that you replace the tree with a sapling. 
 And install a jungle gym. 
 To replace the treehouse that was in the tree you cut down. 
 That way, the neighborhood children will have a place to play, until that sapling is fully grown and can support a new treehouse, which you will build and install. 
 Or I could rule by the letter of the law, find you guilty, and send you to jail with a hefty fine. 
 I'll plant the tree. 
 A wise choice, Mr. Canner. 
 Next case. 
 [Whacks gavel, gallery murmurs] 
 We're off to our first check-up. 
 Jack : Mm! 
 Do you want me to drive you? 
 I finally figured out the car seat. 
 No, it's a nice out. We'll walk. 
 Okay. 
 See you tonight. 
 Hey, have you decided yet? 
 Decide? What? 
 What you want to be called. 
 "Grandpa." 
 "Pop-pop." 
 What? 
 How about... 
 "Jack"? 
 "Jackpa" it is. 
 [Tapping counter] 
 [Shelly laughing] 
 You'd better get going. 
 Right. 
 Hey, I'm really proud of you. 
 Everything you're doing... the job, taking care of the baby. 
 I know it's tough getting your act together, and I just wanted to let you know. 
 Well, you just made this harder. 
 Can I be a little late on the rent? 
 See, it's, uh... 
 Shelly and me, it's our first anniversary coming up. 
 Anniversary? 
 Of when we met. 
 Ah. 
 And I wanted to take her out to dinner. 
 I might be a little short on cash, and I know I promised I'd pay rent... 
 It's okay. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, I think it's a nice idea. 
 Now get to work. 
 Thanks, Jackpa. 
 [Jack snickers] 
 [Sets coffee down] 
 Please stop. 
 It'll drive me crazy knowing that everything is just thrown in there. 
 It'll all be wrinkled. 
 I'm on a boat. Who am I trying to impress? 
 It still amazes me that pretty much all of your belongings can be packed into one duffle bag. 
 You learn to travel light. 
 I would use this for just my shoes. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. I know. 
 And it's not a regular work trip. 
 You could be gone for months, maybe even longer. 
 [Exhales tensely] 
 Hey, it was my idea for you to go. 
 This is your chance to start over. 
 It's not just a job, you could end up with your own boat again. 
 And then I'll be pointing that boat right back here to you. 
 You come back when you can. 
 I'm okay with this. 
 And I know that you can make more money in Alaska than you can here. 
 I'm still going to send you a check for rent every month. 
 I'm moving out. 
 I'm gonna go stay with my mom for a while. 
 I'll have no expenses, and I can sock away a lot of money so that I can get my own place again that much faster. 
 Our own place. 
 This is all my fault. 
 Why? 
 For wanting us to be together so much, that you sold your boat and tried to buy a restaurant? 
 It's no one's fault. 
 It is what it is. 
 I love you. 
 Well, I'm pretty lovable. 
 I love you, too. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Right. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 I mean, what are the odds? 
 Maryellen moves out of my house as Justine moves back in to yours. 
 I love that she's moving back, it's just that I've gotten really used to living on my own, you know? 
 Well, she's not giving you any curfews or anything, is she? 
 It's just that it's a little awkward now that Eric's moved back... 
 Let me fill that up for you. 
 No, I'm good, thanks. 
 Just the check, please. 
 Uh... 
 I'll be taking that. Thank you. 
 You got last time. 
 Do you write this stuff down? 
 Yep. 
 Thanks, Eric. 
 Thank you. 
 [Grumbling sigh] Oh... 
 I am sorry, I just don't know what it is about him. 
 He just makes me so uncomfortable. 
 Are you ever going to forget that time that he took money from Jack? 
 He didn't "take," he stole, and no. 
 Well, that was a long time ago. 
 And he's worked really hard in every area of his life, and he's great with the baby. 
 You don't need to worry. He's Jack's son. 
 I will over-tip. 
 Well, thank you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Jack wants to give me a key. 
 What? To his heart? 
 House. 
 Well, you say it like it's a bad thing. 
 Well, it just seems kind of serious. 
 Well, if it fits on your third finger of your left hand, that's serious, otherwise, it's just a key. 
 But what is the etiquette here? 
 Am I supposed to offer him a key to my place? 
 And if I don't, do I keep the key? 
 And if I keep the key, is that a non-verbal agreement that I'm gonna give him a key? 
 Wow! 
 You sound like me, not you. 
 You're supposed to be the "facts" girl. 
 Not when it comes to love. 
 Well... 
 Your card didn't go through. 
 Well, then, just run it again. 
 No, I, uh... 
 I ran it three times already. 
 I was wondering, do you want me to call the... ? 
 No, no, no. That's good. 
 I... I'm just gonna make a run to the ATM. 
 Don't be silly. 
 No. 
 You'll get it next time! 
 [Sighs heavily] 
 I am so sorry. This is just... 
 Oh, Grace. 
 Very embarrassing. 
 No, it's not. 
 Yes, it is. 
 It's not just the card, it's... 
 [Sighs] 
 Grace, are you okay? 
 No. No, I'm not okay. 
 Far from it. 
 [♪ ♪ ♪] 
 It's the house. 
 It's just sucking me dry. 
 Last month, the furnace. 
 The month before that, the roof, and now, it's the plumbing, and I don't mean just a faucet or something, I mean all the plumbing is shot. 
 I'm at the limit on my credit card, which is why... 
 I mean, when does it stop? 
 It's an old house. Probably never. 
 And it's not just the money, it's also the stress of having to do it all. 
 You know, hire someone, hope they show up, hope they're not ripping you off because you have no idea what they're doing. 
 Dan used to do all of that. 
 Most of the time, he would fix it all himself. 
 I know. 
 Say what you will about him, he was handy. 
 I think I actually found that sexy. 
 And then there's Maryellen's rent. 
 That used to help, but she's not there now, so I'm just overwhelmed. 
 Well, maybe it's time you start to think... 
 What? 
 It's a big house. 
 Sell my house? 
 It could solve a lot of your problems. 
 No! I can't do that. 
 Besides, after 30 years of marriage, Dan got the 401k and I got the house. 
 Still... 
 No. 
 My whole life is in that house. 
 My girls grew up there. 
 Too many memories. 
 It's alright. 
 I'll figure something out. 
 You'll find a way. You always do.

 Be right back. Gotta mail my contract. 
 Okay. 
 Justine. 
 Cecilia? Wow, what a surprise. 
 Haven't seen you in a while. How are you? 
 I'm a little crazy, but in a good way. 
 I finished up school. 
 Congratulations. 
 Thanks. 
 I'm doing accounting for Zach, and trying to straighten out my dad's books at the bar, which isn't easy. 
 You know my dad. 
 And I'm volunteering here with returning veterans. 
 What are you up to? 
 You know, that's a really good question. 
 You sleeping with your eyes open? 
 No, I'm just thinking. 
 What about? 
 Nothing important. 
 Oh, come on, Jack. 
 You know it's not good to lie to your sponsor. 
 The first rule of A.A. is honesty. 
 Bob, who's lying? It's nothing. 
 Alright, let's take this one again, huh? 
 Hi, Jack. 
 [Laughing] 
 Whatcha thinking about? 
 A key. 
 You want to elaborate a little more? 
 I gave Olivia a key to my house. 
 You still lock your doors? 
 Yes, Bob. 
 I still lock my doors. 
 Anyway, she left it at my house, and I don't think she really wants it, and I think maybe she's just too polite to say so. 
 I guess I was just a little confused by her reaction, that's all. 
 Did you ask her? 
 What? 
 Well, point-blank. "Do you want this key, Olivia?" 
 Well, I... 
 No. I didn't actually... ask her. 
 Well, it might be a good place to start, instead of sitting here, gazing into space, don't you think? 
 [Thumps desk] Yeah. 
 Thanks, guys. 
 Pay day! 
 Oh... wow. 
 Yeah, well, welcome to the wonderful world of taxes. 
 Yeah, I just thought it'd be more is all. 
 Eric, someone once said that money can't buy happiness. 
 I'll try and get you more hours next week. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 Did you get that sink stopper for that upstairs bathroom, or did they have to order it? 
 Nope, they had it in stock. 
 But they had to order the tile. 
 Tile? 
 Mm. For the floor. 
 We're re-tiling the floor? 
 Well, one of us is.

 [Knocking at door] 
 Well, hello! 
 Hey. 
 You ready? 
 For... ? 
 You forgot we were going to go out? 
 [Gasps] 
 Oh, Cliff, I am so sorry. 
 I should've called. I can't. 
 Grace? 
 Yeah, I'll be right there. 
 It's the plumber. 
 Apparently, I have lead in my pipes. 
 Oh. 
 I can't leave him. 
 Oh, it's no big deal. 
 So we can do this another time? 
 I am sorry. 
 Why don't I stay and we could have dinner here? 
 Well, I don't have any water. I can't cook. 
 Let's order pizza or something. 
 You don't mind? 
 No. Not at all. 
 I'm getting off cheap. 
 I had planned on taking you out someplace nice. 
 Yeah? Well, I'll warn you, I happen to like expensive toppings. 
 I'll go get a menu. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Carl, this is Cliff. Cliff, Carl. 
 Hey. 
 I'm afraid I've got some bad news, Grace. 
 How bad? 
 The lead is just part of the problem. 
 You have a leak. 
 I'm pretty sure it's in the foundation, so. 
 How much? 
 Well... 
 We have to break the concrete slab and replace the pipes with PVC, which will last longer, but... 
 Carl. Please. How much? 
 We're looking at about $10,000. 
 Oh... 
 Minimum. 
 Minimum. 
 So I've made a list. 
 Grandpa, granddad, pop-pops... 
 "Gramps," which I loathe... 
 They're all sweet, just pick one. 
 Yeah, but which one makes me sound youngest? 
 You're really struggling with this, aren't you? 
 It's not the baby. I love the baby. 
 It's just the title. 
 "Grandpa." 
 I feel like I should get a walker and start eating dinner at 4:30. 
 I know... 
 How about "pappy?" 
 I can get you a little corn cob pipe. 
 Huh? [Laughs] 
 Listen, um... Can we talk about this? 
 Jack... 
 Why does that key upset you so much? 
 It doesn't upset me, it surprised me. 
 It's no big deal. 
 It's a key. 
 It's just a convenience. 
 Maybe, but... 
 But... 
 What? 
 Okay, so you don't want the key. 
 I don't think so. 
 I don't want to talk about this. 
 Well, you know what? 
 There's two of us in this relationship. 
 I do want to talk about it. 
 There you are! 
 I thought I'd start moving in. Is it a good time? 
 [♪ ♪ ♪] 
 Did Jack leave? 
 Oh! Hey. Yes. Yes, he did. 
 Sorry for barging in on you like that earlier. 
 Oh, no, don't worry about it. 
 Seemed like you were in the middle of something. 
 No, no. 
 What? 
 No. 
 Jack seemed so serious. 
 Oh, he's just going through a whole grandfather crisis. That's all. 
 So do you have much left to move over? 
 Because I'd love to help you. 
 No, there's not much to do, and it's not like I'm all that busy right now. 
 It's going to be fun to have you back. 
 Yeah. 
 What's the matter? 
 You know, it's just... moving back in with my mom, at my age. 
 It's just a transition. Everybody goes through it. 
 Most people more than once. 
 I know. 
 I just feel like I've been "transitioning" for a long time now. 
 It's gonna get better. I promise. You'll see. 
 Thank you for letting me move back in. 
 This is your home and it always will be. 
 Look at that. 
 Even with the tips, I don't have enough. 
 Well, Moon said if it all works out, he'll give you a raise next month. 
 Yeah, but that's next month. 
 I needed this now. 
 I mean, this'll barely cover the stuff for the baby this week! 
 Do you know how expensive kids are? 
 I have an idea, yes. 
 And babies? 
 Babies are the cheapest part! 
 I mean, I sat up all last night thinking about the stuff for when she's older, like food, her clothes, going to Disney World and stuff. 
 It adds up, doesn't it? 
 And paying for college. 
 Alright, maybe I'm rushing that one a bit, but you know, I got to start thinking about this stuff now, and I can't do much, just waiting tables, I know that. 
 [Disappointed sigh] 
 I just wanted to take Shelly out on a real date just once. 
 Wait. Wait a second. What? 
 Are you telling me you've never taken Shelly out on a real date? 
 Well, not a real one. 
 I mean, we met at this party, and then... 
 You know, we just hung out. 
 You "hung out." 
 Yeah. 
 Man, times have changed. 
 We used to have to take girls places. 
 I wanted to do something special for her. 
 Let her have a little fun. She deserves it. 
 [Troubled sigh] 
 Can I stop pretending I know what I'm doing now? 
 [Laughs] Yes. 
 Ahh. 
 Oh... 
 Sorry. 
 If it were a horse... 
 I don't know what I'm gonna do. 
 Seriously, I have no idea. 
 Well, I can tell you what your problem is. 
 Yeah? 
 You don't own this house. 
 This house owns you. 
 You have to paint it, take care of it, insure it. 
 The only good thing is, you don't have to put it through college. 
 Ha-ha. 
 I know it's all you got from the divorce. 
 I know there's a lot of good memories here... 
 Mm-hmm. It's a lot of memories. 
 But it's just a building, Grace. 
 Walls, glass and nails. 
 If you bought something smaller, you still have your daughters and your friends. 
 At the end of the day, that's really what home is, don't you think? 
 I know it's not practical. 
 It's way too big for one person. 
 There's one problem after another. 
 I have no idea what's gonna come up next, but I can't help it. 
 Cliff, I love those memories. 
 Most of them. 
 I know.

 Man! That thing is like a boomerang. 
 No matter what I say to you, it just keeps on coming back to me. 
 Okay, tell me why. 
 I just want you to have it. 
 It comes with strings. 
 What strings? 
 You want a key to my house. 
 Olivia, giving you that key is about how I feel about you. 
 You never have to use it. 
 Oh, I hate this. 
 Why? 
 Stan used to do this all the time. 
 I'm not Stan. 
 I know, but you sound like him right now, the whole passive-aggressive thing. 
 Passive-aggressive? 
 Olivia, how long have you known me? 
 Okay? I don't play games. 
 I say what I mean, I mean what I say. 
 It doesn't feel that way to me. 
 Well, I ju... I just wanted to give you a key!

 Ugh!

 That house is the last remnant of my life with Dan. 
 Everything else about him is gone, except that house. 
 I really think that's why I dug my heels in. 
 You're probably right. 
 So get this. 
 Couple of months ago, I had this realtor come to my door. 
 A buyer wanted the house. 
 Well, of course I said I was not selling at the time, but I called her right before I came here, and that buyer is still interested. 
 That's great! 
 I know! 
 No open houses. 
 No strangers looking through my medicine cabinet. 
 And I can handle the paperwork, that way, you can negotiate a lower commission with the realtor. 
 That's great. 
 Grace, are you sure? 
 I cannot spend the rest of my life looking in a rearview mirror, Olivia. 
 It's scary, but I've gotta just stop this, and start dealing with the future, and let go of the past.

 It's... it's real nice. 
 [Shelly giggles] 
 What are you doing? 
 Sharing. 
 And taking the broccoli of your half. 
 I remembered. 
 Thank you. 
 How can you not like broccoli? 
 Oh, please, Olivia, there's not enough soy sauce in the world to make that stuff palatable... 
 It's both mushy and crunchy at the same time. 
 It's... I don't know, it's an oxymoronic vegetable to me. 
 [Both laughing] 
 Shh! 
 Oh... 
 I'm sorry. 
 They got a lobster special. 
 I'm allergic to seafood. 
 You don't remember that time that I had that tiny piece of shrimp and almost had to go to the E.R.? 
 Right! Right. 
 No, uh, I mean, pasta's good. 
 I have a gluten intolerance. 
 Did you tell me about that? 
 Mm. Once or twice.

 It's funny, isn't it? 
 These little milestones. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well... 
 We're at that point in the relationship where we, uh, actually remember things about each other. 
 Like you, with the broccoli tonight. 
 Oh. So what do you remember about me? 
 Uh... 
 Well, you do cook bacon weird. 
 Do you know that? 
 I've been meaning to bring this up with you, actually. 
 I beg your pardon? 
 It's true. 
 You lay out each strip perfectly straight, you know, like it's up against a ruler or something. 
 Well, you just throw it in a clump in the pan, it doesn't cook evenly. 
 Well, it's not supposed to cook evenly, it's bacon. 
 I mean, that's the fun of bacon. 
 "The fun of bacon." 
 You're the only human being I know that would say something like that. 
 Am I wrong? I'm not wrong. 
 [Laughing] 
 Just a little bit. 
 So that was fun. 
 Yeah. 
 We should really do it more often. 
 Eric... 
 [Sighs] 
 I think I want to move to Seattle. 
 What? 
 My aunt called last week, and she offered to help out with the baby while I, you know, get back on my feet, and finish school. 
 I told her no, but... 
 But what? 
 I can't work and you're barely making any money. 
 Wait. You're not talking about us going, you're talking about you and the baby going. 
 You can visit her as much as you want. 
 Did I do something? 
 You're trying your best, I know that, but you're not ready for all this. 
 I don't know if I'm ready for it either, but... 
 But I know I stand a better chance somewhere else, Shelly, I thought we were doing okay. 
 I think I want more than "okay." 
 And you deserve more than "okay" too.

 Olivia. 
 Hi. 
 I got your message to meet you here. 
 Are you okay? What's going on? 
 Wait a second. 
 Eric is at work... 
 You let yourself in. 
 Yes, I did. 
 Oh, Olivia, please, let's just not do this... 
 Jack. 
 Again, alright? I just want... 
 Jack, would you just... 
 I just want you to keep it. 
 Alright? You never have to use it. Just keep the key! 
 Shouts : Jack! 
 This is the key to my house. 
 Your house? 
 Yes. 
 [Laughs] 
 What made you change your mind? 
 Oh... 
 After that silly fight the other night, I... 
 I knew you weren't being passive-aggressive or playing games. 
 That was Stan. 
 I'm Jack. 
 I know. 
 Just do me a favor, will ya? 
 Call before you come over. 
 Come here, you. 
 Mm. 
 So... 
 Major step forward relationship-wise, wouldn't you say? 
 I wouldn't go too far... I don't want to see an announcement in the paper or anything. 
 [Jack laughs] 
 Deal. 
 You know, I was so nervous giving you my key. 
 Yeah? Why? 
 Going back to seventh grade, I liked this girl, Debbie Zimowicz, and as a sign of my undying devotion and love for her, I gave her my Mike Schmidt-autographed baseball. 
 Mm? 
 Hall-of-famer, third-baseman, life-long phill... 
 Anyway. 
 I was 12... and she looked at it and then she just gave it right back to me. 
 I was devastated. 
 Sorry to give you bad déjà vu. 
 I've recovered, but thank you. 
 [Phone chimes] 
 Oh, is that me or you? 
 Me. 
 Oh. It's an e-mail. Business. Just... 
 You know, it's funny, I ran into Debbie years later. 
 Married four times. 
 Now, if I'd played my cards better, I think I could've been number five. 
 It's about Grace's house. 
 Is there a problem? 
 Yeah. A big one.
