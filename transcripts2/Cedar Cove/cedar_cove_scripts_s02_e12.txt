 To you. 
 Previously on Cedar Cove... 
 Rebecca : You shouldn't be signing things when you don't know what you're signing. 
 I got this under control. 
 Look who's back. 
 Colin. 
 What is happening to you, Allison, is wrong. 
 Get in. 
 Hi, Justine. 
 Seth, what are you doing here? 
 It's nice to see you, too. 
 Yeah. 
 Of course. Come here. 
 You just surprised me. 
 Okay, well, I think I'm going to go. 
 Luke, wait. 
 Hi, Luke. 
 Seth. Luke. 
 Uh... 
 It's nice to finally meet you. 
 I've heard a lot about you. 
 And I've heard absolutely nothing about you. 
 I gotta go. 
 Thank you. 
 It was nice meeting you. 
 And here I thought I was going to surprise you. 
 Seth. 
 I'm going to stay at Derek's tonight. 
 No, you don't have to do that. 
 I want to. 
 You're supposed to be eating. 
 Yeah, I'm a little too nervous to eat. 
 And why's that? 
 'Cause you're sort of freaking me out. 
 Sorry, but you are. 
 I mean, you pick me up, you tell me we need to talk, you bring me here, and we don't talk. 
 I thought we'd eat first. 
 So eat. 
 As long as it's not my last meal. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Wow, those are unflattering. 
 I don't understand, Allison, if you don't like them, then why did you post them? 
 Kayla. 
 My mom got an email from the principal. 
 That wasn't me. 
 No, it was that librarian, Grace. 
 Kayla, please, just leave me alone. 
 You should have thought of that before you tried to steal Liam. 
 I didn't steal him! 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Good morning. 
 How was the benefit? 
 Seth's back. 
 He's at Derek's. 
 He didn't stay here with you? 
 I never told him about Luke. 
 He didn't take it well. 
 Not that I blame him. 
 Well, don't keep any more surprises from Seth. 
 Love conquers a lot, but never dishonesty. 
 By the way, I got into grad school. 
 [Gasps] 
 [Laughing] 
 Gosh, honey, that is just terrific. 
 Aw... 
 Well, as Jack would say, you buried the lede. 
 Hey. 
 Dad. 
 Thanks for coming. 
 No problem. 
 What's going on? 
 I need some advice. 
 Sure, you bet. 
 Yeah, well, in order to get this advice, I have to tell you something that's going to upset you. 
 Okay. 
 Look, Dick Turnbull, one of Warren's east coast business partners, he took me to dinner, and he was asking a lot of questions. 
 What kind of questions? 
 I'm just going to tell you. 
 Uh... 
 Warren has a second set of books that he keeps from his partners. 
 [Sighs] 
 And you knew this? 
 Yeah. 
 And you stayed? 
 Yeah. 
 Dad, it's a good job. 
 Good money, good experience. 
 I'm not going to throw that away because... because why? 
 Because you're working for a crook? 
 Quit. 
 Right now. 
 I'm serious, Eric. 
 Get out. 
 Okay, I got it. 
 Got what? 
 The name and address of that girl that's been bullying Allison. 
 It's Kayla Roberts. 
 All right. 
 Her mother is Sara Roberts, formerly Sara Jones. 
 From our high school? 
 None other. 
 She was just awful. 
 Oh, I know. 
 She bullied that one girl into going to a different school. 
 Imagine what Sara could have done in an Internet age? 
 I'm so glad we went to school when we did. 
 What are you going to do? 
 I want to talk to her. 
 I'm going to see if she can get her daughter to stop. 
 But Allison asked you not to do anything. 
 I'm taking a page from the Olivia Lockhart playbook. 
 How many times have I told you I did not want your help? 
 Quite a few. 
 And how many times did you ignore me and help me anyway? 
 Oh, quite a few. 
 And how many times have I been thankful that you did ignore me because you did help me? 
 Quite a few. 
 Exactly. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 Hey, Grace, uh... 
 I told Jack the idea about us getting a place together in Seattle. 
 What was his response? 
 For the first time since we started dating, he left before I woke up. 
 I just feel like he's slipping away. 
 I'm going to take a page out of the Grace Sherman playbook. 
 This is something Dan Sherman taught me. 
 One person cannot do all the work in a relationship. 
 Come here. 
 Announcer : Mother nature's gotta love us. 
 Look at this beautiful weather... You ready to lose, old man? Excuse me? You should have stayed retired. Don't think so. Yeah, well, I do think so. Did I do something to you? Come on, I see the way you look at Alex. What are you talking about? Come on, you think you're the first cowboy to try to muscle in on me? She's an employee and a friend. What are you trying to say? You cross the line with Alex, and that 1,500-pound bull is going to be the least of your worries. Have a good ride. You know, I dug a little deeper into Colin's past. He's been living in spokane for a while, and... He was arrested for assault. But the woman he attacked wouldn't testify. Whatever happened, it wasn't your fault. Don't give Colin this kind of power over you. Please, just find a way to get Bob to let it go. Please. Okay. What are you doing here? I guess it's true, there is no honor among thieves. Honor is for saps and marks, Dick, and I am neither. Hey, wait a second, did you just call me a thief? Because I gotta be honest with you, coming from you, the biggest cheat that I know, I think I'll take that as a compliment. Thank you. I spoke with Eric. Mm. What did you do, ask him to get your coffee? If you think Eric knows anything about our business, that is an insult. He knows what I want him to know, nothing more. I have got accountants going over every receipt, purchase order, every dime. If you so much as skimmed a penny... hey, listen to me, I provide a service to you and your friends, all right? A "wash and dry" cash service. So you don't forget who needs who. And you don't forget, if I have proof that you're in business with the F.B.I, I'm going to want to sever more than just our business ties. So, I read your rough draft on the Sunday edition piece. Yeah? Nice. Very good reporting. Thanks, Jeri. Two. But I know that you don't need to be back in Seattle today. Before you start spitting out excuses about why you're here, know that you don't need to have an excuse to be here. I get it, and I'm not judging. I just... [Sighs] What? Olivia wants us to get a place here in Seattle. And you? I thought Seattle would just be... A safe place? Where you could get a little freedom? [Laughs] What? Oh, nothing. I was just thinking about how much Olivia would love living in the same city as me. Yeah. The plaintiff is ordered to return the security deposit in full, and pay punitive damages three times the amount of rent. [Bangs gavel] We're going to take a short recess for lunch. Court will resume in an hour. All rise. Please, Bob, come on in. Yeah. How can I help you? It's about Peggy. I think she has a stalker. A stalker? Yeah. Now, Roy is on it. And we'll find him, but once we do, what can I do? I mean, what can the law do to protect her? Sit down, let's talk. You're busy. Oh, no, I was just going to surprise Jack with lunch. He can wait. Ah. Sara Jones. Hi, it's... Grace? Yeah, I know. Oh, and it's Roberts. Unlike some of us, I was actually able to hold onto my husband. [Chuckling awkwardly] You haven't changed a bit since high school. Aw. You have, you're... Older. So, what do you want? When did you move back to Cedar Cove? Oh, about six months ago. Who do you work for, the census? This is about Kayla. Oh. Just like high school. You and Olivia, the dynamic duo, always sticking your nose into other people's business... do you have any idea what your daughter is doing? I know she's my daughter, and her business is none of your business. Well, it's nice to see you don't wear your uniform all the time. Kind of an unfair advantage. That was just for some benefit. Yeah. The benefit you took my girlfriend to? The date that wasn't a date, that sure looked like a date? She was doing me a favor. I don't know what Justine told you, but... I think it's clear from last night she hasn't told me anything. Well, maybe you should take that up with her. I'm taking it up with you. I could tell something was up with Justine, phone calls, Skype, texting. In every way, she was pulling away from me. I thought it was because I was in Alaska, but... You know, she helped me when no one else did. She was there for me. Which means, at some point, you guys were more than that. It's not what you think. She helped me with my P.T.S.D. That helped her discover that she wanted to be a social worker, which is why she applied to grad school. Grad school? Yeah, she's going to get her master's at W.P.U. You knew none of this. I'll call you back. Bye. Hey, I got your message. Yeah, listen, um, we need to talk. In Cooperton? Yeah, Cooperton, it's a lot safer for the both of us. Whoa, whoa, Warren? Look... Dick came to me, and I mean, I don't think I said anything, but he asked me a lot of questions, and if I let something slip about the books... listen, Eric? Yes? Shut up. Okay. Can I trust you? Of course, you can trust me. I'm working with the F.B.I. [Chuckles] Right. Yeah? All right. That's the name and number of the agent who's in charge of my case. I'm one of the good guys, Eric. Whoa, the... The two sets of books, the documents I signed, the checks I signed... it's a dummy account that I set up with the F.B.I. to fool the guys back east, like Dick. Not to mention, protect my other clients. So you're not actually skimming money off the top? No, of course, I do. I do it all the time. It's standard operating procedure. Everybody does it. After my arrest, I saw the light, okay? I volunteered to help. Scout's honor. And I was in the scouts, by the way, that's a true story. But that's neither here nor there. Look, the fact of the matter is, I've helped put away a lot of Dick's friends back east, but he's the big one, and he is going down. That is, if you help us. Us? Yes, us. Me and the F.B.I. We need your help, kid. I mean, look, Dick doesn't trust me, right? But with you... You're seriously on the level right now? May God strike me down. All right? Now, look, what's going to happen is, you're going to get a phone call... Hey! [Gasps in fright] [Chuckling] Hey. Oh, those are going to be beautiful. Aren't they? I'm glad I ran into you. I just got a call. That new hot tub cover ended up in Cooperton by mistake. What? Yeah. I gotta drive over there and pick it up. Bob, we have four groups arriving. Not to worry. I called Colin. He has nothing to do today, so he'll be glad to give you a hand. [Briskly] No. I don't need his help. Just... go pick up the hot tub cover. Really, I'm fine. All right. I love you. Love you, too. [Crowd cheering and clapping] Hugh seems to really like you. Yeah, well, wait until I beat him on the bull. It's not you, it's me. I broke up with him. We're great as long as we have a few counties between us. It's funny, since I was 16, I've been dating the same guy. Different names, different hair, different jobs, but they're all the same guy. They all treat me the same, too. Really badly. Can I do anything? Yeah. Go out there and beat the snot out of him. He could learn some humility. My pleasure, ma'am. Really? You called my dad? You won't listen to reason. Rebecca told me, the documents, the ones Warren had you sign. The account that you've been signing on. Anything illegal, it all gets traced back to you. Warren is working with the F.B.I. to bring down Dick Turnbull, and the accounts, the corporation that I'm signing checks from, it isn't real... he can't be that dense. Warren is a bad man. Not to me. Eric... Warren has never given me a reason not to trust him. And why should I trust you? You hate Warren. And you're dating him. Dated. As in once. And if you could get past your jealousy, you would see that this is serious, and I'm just trying to help you. Look, you have to want to save yourself. Call me if that ever happens. I'm not jealous. I talked to the F.B.I agent in charge. Warren isn't lying. So thank you, but I'm good. Warren's taking care of everything, including me. Okay, so... I can't drink, and I can't hold down anything but ginger-ale and saltine crackers, but we need to celebrate. What? You're hiding a pregnancy from your husband, and my boyfriend thinks I am the worst girlfriend ever. You are not. Oh, I'm pretty bad. Justine... Can we just concentrate on your life? Nothing to concentrate on. Ian's about to ship off to a war zone, and there is no way I am going to tell him about this pregnancy. You need to learn from my mistake. I should have told Seth about Luke. Here's your chance. I'll talk to you later. 
 
 Hi, Seth. Bye, Seth. Hi. I went to see Luke. What did he say? I'm more interested in what you have to say. Look, I... I don't know why I didn't tell you about Luke, but... It was a kiss, just a stupid kiss. I didn't mean anything. You kissed him? You didn't know? I do now. [Knocks] Hey, you. Hi. What's the matter? Do you notice lately how ever since you got this job at "the courier," we seem to be, I don't know, out of sync? That's not true. Yes, it is. What is going on with you, Jack? You're up, you're down, and every chance you get, you run off to Seattle. [Sighs, scoffing] Okay, what did I do? Do you really have to ask? Yeah, I'm asking. What about my offer, for us to get a place together in Seattle? [Knock on door] Oh, sorry to interrupt. That's all right. I should be going. I don't want to talk about it. So, what's going on? Rosie called. Allison never made it to school after lunch and nobody knows where she is. [Sighs] Thank you. Troy has his men looking all over Cedar Cove. Okay, good. I've already called Roy. He's gonna head to Cooperton and talk to a P.I. Friend. [Sighs heavily] I don't think she'd go to Cooperton. Well, she's been pretty upset about this. Rosie tried to talk to her about this whole bully thing at school, and she just denied anything was even going on. Don't you worry. We're going to find her. Yes. We will. Hey, come on, I'm here to save the day. I told Bob I don't need your help. But I'm happy to help. I don't want to make things awkward. I just want everything to go back to the way it was. I mean, we had some good times, remember? [Winces] Peggy? Allison. Do you mind if I stay here? Well, sure. Please don't tell my mom. Come on, sweetie. Well, hey there. Seth is so angry at me. I don't know what to do. You do know this doesn't have anything to do with Seth, or Luke, don't you? What are you talking about? Ever since you were a little girl, you've been bringing home wounded, hurt things in hopes of making them better. And after Jordan died, that need in you to caretake grew exponentially. It's what Drew you to Warren, Seth, and Luke. You lose yourself in the men that you love and date, and maybe it's time you break that pattern. You're so lucky. What do you mean? You and Jack, it's just so perfect and easy. Honest. I hope that one day, I can feel as happy and safe as you do. Love you. Love you. Please welcome our new championship bull-rider, Cliff Harding! Good job, cowboy. [Cheering] You won! Aw, Hugh isn't happy, so thank you! Announcer : To show the young guys how this job is done. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Guys! [Cheering and applauding] Ladies and gentlemen, one more time, a round of applause for our new champion, Cliff Harding! Okay... Now, why don't you tell me what's going on, huh? So, um... This guy named Liam asked me to go to a party, and I was so excited. Uh, but then Kayla found out, and that's when this whole thing started. Because Kayla liked Liam. Oh. First, I started hearing kids talking about me in school, and then the text messages started, and the tweets, and the postings, and then the phone calls. And then yesterday... What did she do yesterday? Uh... Yesterday, she hacked into my computer and posted these photos someone took of me in the locker room. What? And if that wasn't bad enough, she put my name and photo on some dating website, and I've been getting all these calls from some strange men. She's relentless, and now everyone in school thinks that I'm messing around with a bunch of different people, and I've tried talking to Kayla, but she won't stop. I'm trapped and there's nothing I can do. No... I spoke to Grace, and she said if you file a formal complaint against this Kayla, the school and the court can help you, honey. Peggy, I can't. You know, I knew someone once who was in a similar situation. And every day, she had to live with the fact that someone had hurt her. She felt helpless to do anything about it. You stand up to Kayla. The law is on your side. Use it. But you gotta take the first step. Okay? You're not alone. Hi. Hi. Look, I'm sorry. Really. No, I'm sorry... I'm sorry that I came back. I'm sorry that I left, too. Where are you going? I think the question is, where are we going? I can see you want to be with Luke. That's not true. It's a little true. Bottom line, it's decision time. Excuse me? There are grad schools in Alaska, Justine. So, you want me to move to Alaska? I came back here. I sold my boat. I gave up what I loved doing. I bought a restaurant, so we could be together, so we could live and work together. I gave you a ring. I asked you to be my wife. It's time for you to do something, or nothing. Because you're the love of my life, Justine Lockhart. I can't imagine life without you. Choose. Pick someone. Make a decision. I'm taking the late ferry. I can't just pack up my life and move to Alaska today. But you should be able to make a decision, today. Because if you love me, your decision is already made. I really hope that wasn't a goodbye kiss. [Knocking urgently] Allison? Oh, you had us so worried. Oh, my goodness. I want to do what you said. I want to file a complaint against Kayla Roberts. So it all goes down tonight. Listen, I don't want you to worry, okay? There's going to be agents everywhere. You're going to do great, okay? Dick Turnbull is waiting for his investment money, and what he's going to get is five to ten. Got it. You're playing with the big boys now, Eric. How do you like it? I love it. [Chuckling] Great. Now, come on, get out. [Sighs] Okay, I'm here. Thanks for coming, Bob. Why am I here? Why did I have to lie to Peggy about meeting you? Since you hired me as well, technically, I'm not breaking confidentiality. It's Colin. He's the one sending the flowers to Peggy. It's him. He did it. Why? Why wouldn't she tell me? There's more, Bob. A lot more. Hi. I'm calling for officer Ian Rendall. His wife. We had a scheduled video call, but it didn't go through. Yes, I can wait. Yes, I'm here. Oh, really? He can't speak to me? Can't or won't? Olivia... Hey. How's Allison? Oh, Peggy found her. Good. Uh, so, night court? You think you're gonna be able to help me out? It's just not a good time for me, but I'll fill in for you until you find a permanent replacement. Oh, thank you. I owe you. Well, I like seafood and red wine. Expensive red wine. Well, it's a date. Goodbye, Tony. I hope Jack knows how lucky he is. I'm Rebecca, the A.D.A., and it's my responsibility to decide what crimes get prosecuted in Cedar Cove. Crimes? What are you talking about? Kayla's in serious trouble. Oh, God, for posting something on a computer, or sending a couple texts? Come on. It's called cyber-stalking and computer trespassing, and it's a crime, and your daughter is guilty. You can't prove anything. This is just a sample of your daughter's handiwork. The thing about this kind of crime and the kids that commit them is, no matter how technologically proficient they are, they forget, that whatever they post, text, tweet, email, Instagram. It leaves an irrefutable trail against them. Kayla is guilty. She's in trouble, and this is serious, and whatever you say or do next will impact both of your lives. You're the bully. No, you were the bully, and you probably still are, and, sadly, you've taught your daughter to torture, intimidate, and harass. I am sorry. I wish I would have done more to stop you in high school, but I didn't realize by not stopping you, the cycle of bullying would continue into the next generation. And today, the cycle stops, because what you were able to do freely 20-odd years ago, now is literally against the law. So the question is, do you want to work with the A.D.A., or do you want to take your chances in court? [Scoffs] Am I going to have to call the sheriff and tell him I've got a deranged man in my office, Jack? You may have snowed my son, but I know you. I know who you are, and I am here to tell you, if anything happens to Eric, and I am going to hold you personally responsible. Ooh. I'm scared. What're you going to do, Jack, write a story about me? It kills you, doesn't it? You know what, I love that it does. Because you want to know why, Jack? Your son, Eric, likes me more, he trusts me more. As a matter of fact, it's my John Lobb loafers he wants to walk in, not your worn-out, bargain basement, ugly writer shoes. I mean, here you are, you've tried everything to get close to your son, you know what's funny about it? He wants to be with me. He wants to be like me. And you know, when you think about it, it's actually pretty sad, really. Not one hair on his head. Otherwise, I'm coming back here, and no one is going to be able to protect you from that. Mm. Hey there. You are a horrible man, Colin McFadden. You were my friend. Bob's friend. And that night, 20 years ago, when Bob hit rock bottom. How could you? I have had 20 years of asking myself, "why?" And now I see "why?" Doesn't matter. You attacked me, and that was wrong, that was a crime. All these years, I buried it, and I tried to forget it. But you can't forget something like that. But I want to thank you for coming back here now. Because if you hadn't, I wouldn't be able to do this. Wow. That felt better than I imagined. Now get out of my life and never come back. Or you can wait till Bob gets home if you like. But know that as soon as I see him, I am telling him exactly what you did to me. I am done hiding. I am done being afraid. It's over. You have no power over me anymore. [♪♪♪] One iced latte, extra foam, hold the espresso. That's just cold milk. Yes. So, why not call it that? 'Cause I'm Moon. [Chuckles] Cecilia. Hey. [Sighs heavily] I, uh, I did something that I felt I needed to do, but I don't think you're going to be happy about it. What are you talking about? I thought Ian should know about the baby. I know if it were me, I'd want Ian to tell me. What did you do? I emailed him. Luke... He emailed you back. He wanted me to give it to you. And I don't think he wanted you to be alone when you read it. Eric, where are you? Call me back. Please? [Crowd cheering and applauding] As they come around one more time, let's show some applause, some appreciation for what they do so good. I'd like to introduce you to a good friend of mine... What happened? I've been looking all over the place for you. You okay? Yeah. I just needed to clear my head. About? You. Excuse me? You know that saying "hiding in plain sight"? Yeah. Yeah, well, I think that's what my heart has been doing with you. If I hadn't accidentally kissed you... I didn't plan that. I didn't expect it. I didn't even see it coming. But I felt something. Grace... Yeah, I know, Grace, and I don't- Grace. Peggy? Colin? Gone. [♪♪♪] ♪ I've been searching for a way ♪
