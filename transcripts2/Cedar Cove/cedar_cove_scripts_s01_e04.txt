 Olivia : Previously, on  Cedar Cove... 
 Hi, dad. 
 I haven't talked to him in years. 
 Well, here's your chance to get to know him. 
 I just got called for a job, but I have to leave tomorrow. 
 I got to find myself a job. 
 What do you do? 
 Mostly handyman stuff. 
 Grace : Jack's son... I saw him steal money. 
 [Ambient music plays] 
 Justine? 
 Hey. 
 Why are you eating alone? 
 Because I chose to. 
 No, what I mean is, I heard about this guy... what's his name? Uh, Seth? 
 That he was in town, you two were... 
 Hanging out together? 
 He left. He had a fishing job in Alaska. 
 Ah. Fishing. 
 I guess someone's got to do it, right? 
 What... what are you reading, anyway? 
 What is this? Stargazing? 
 I happen to love stargazing. 
 Since when? 
 Uh, since, uh, about 20 seconds ago. 
 You mind if I join you? 
 Come on. Just two friends enjoying a meal together. 
 It's no big deal. 
 I'll even let you read me my horoscope. 
 It's astronomy, not astrology. 
 Right. 
 I'm going to let this dough rise overnight, make us some nice, fresh scones for breakfast. 
 Distracted : Mm-hmm. 
 And then... 
 I'm gonna go upstairs and wallpaper our bedroom with pictures of pink bunny rabbits. 
 I'll be right there. 
 [Loud thump outside] 
 Do we have a late check-in? 
 There's nothing on the books. 
 Can I help you? 
 I need a room. 
 [Truck pulls away] 
 Yeah. What happened to you? 
 Do you have a room or what? 
 No. We're full up. 
 Now, there's a motel about four Miles down the road. 
 If you want, I can call you a cab. 
 I know it's late. 
 Look, I'll pay you up front. 
 How much is it? 
 I left my wallet in the car. 
 I just need a place to sleep. 
 Well, we've got a comfortable bed and all the WiFi you can use. the Maple Room's available. 
 Isn't there someone in the Maple Room? 
 No, Bob, it's free. 
 So, why don't you just come on in? 
 Get a good night's sleep, and we'll settle all this in the morning. 
 You like fresh homemade scones for breakfast? 
 [♪] 
 Okay, it's got to go to that side. 
 More to your left. 
 No! Your other left. 
 Now higher. 
 First year organizing the Art Walk, and she's a total stress-head. 
 Well, it is a big opportunity she's been handed. 
 The Art Walk is the cultural event of the year. 
 Mind if I quote you on that? 
 You may. 
 You know, I have seen a lot of talent here over the years. 
 "says Judge Olivia Lockhart." 
 So what do you think, Eric? 
 Uh, it's... great. 
 I'm not really into art. 
 "Says Eric Griffith." 
 'Cause, you know, it's my job to cover all the angles. 
 And what about yours? 
 Hmm? 
 Job. You find anything yet? 
 Yeah, I'm still looking. 
 We're on our way to the office now, check out some more want ads. 
 Well, I'm sure you're gonna find something. 
 'Course we will. 
 You two have fun. We'll catch up later. 
 "Still looking." Yeah, right. 
 You know, maybe we should cut him some slack. 
 [Scoffs] I'm sorry. 
 He stole that money from his father. 
 He wasn't borrowing anything. 
 Well, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. 
 And I'm willing to give him a kick in the butt. 
 [♪] 
 Morning, Bob! 
 Morning, Allison. You're late. 
 Actually, I'm early. 
 Now I'm on time. 
 [Chuckles] 
 How'd you do on that chemistry test? 
 98%. 
 So there's room for improvement. 
 It was the highest grade in the class! 
 They grade on a curve? 
 Apparently. 
 I guess that makes you the smartest girl in the class. 
 Again. 
 [Both laughing] 
 Guess so. 
 Yeah. Good girl! 
 Morning, Peggy! 
 Hey. 
 Oh, can I take that up for you? 
 Oh, no, I've got it. Thanks, sweetheart. 
 All right. 
 Good job. 
 Since when are we starting to serve room service? 
 We're now the Cedar Cove Four Seasons? 
 Oh, it's practically lunch, and our guest hasn't even been down for breakfast yet. 
 Ah, maybe he just wants to be left alone. 
 Nonsense. I have scones, darling. 
 Good morning! Coffee! 
 Hello? 
 I have scones! 
 [♪] 
 Hello? [Knocks] 
 Excuse me? 
 Bob!

 Cedar Cove 01x04 
Suspicious Minds 
Originally Aired August 10, 2013 
 Well, I've sealed the room till the coroner gets here. 
 Is he bringing the crime lab crew with him? 
 Peggy, this isn't  CSI: Miami. 
 What do you think? Heart attack? 
 I don't know. 
 I checked his vitals, and then backed away. 
 But I did notice the window next to the door was open. 
 You do that? 
 No. 
 Well, I didn't do it. 
 I only air out on Tuesdays. 
 So you're thinking someone broke in and killed him? 
 Or he opened the window to get some air. 
 Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. 
 Let's start at the beginning. 
 Now, who was he? 
 I couldn't find a wallet or I.D. 
 He said that he left it in his car. 
 What was his name? 
 We didn't ask. 
 You mean to tell me you let a stranger with no I.D. and no money check into your place? 
 Bob didn't want to let him in. 
 It was my fault. 
 I just felt sorry for him. 
 I just figured that we'd drive him to his car in the morning after breakfast. 
 Well, what about the cut on his forehead? 
 The bleeding knuckles? 
 He say how he got them? 
 I didn't ask. 
 I didn't want to make him uncomfortable. 
 [Sigh] 
 Okay, here's a construction job about half an hour away in a town called Olalla. 
 I could check it out, but, you know, I was hoping for something a little closer. 
 Excuse me, gentlemen. 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 You are allowed to interrupt anytime you like. What is up? 
 I have a leaky pipe. 
 I mean, there's a pipe leaking in my chambers. 
 Anyway, it's taking the city forever to fix it. 
 Okay. 
 Sounds annoying. 
 Not exactly newsworthy. 
 Well, it got me thinking. 
 Eric, you mentioned doing some handyman work. 
 Are you interested? 
 I mean, you would be paid, of course. 
 Talk about closer. 
 Thanks. That would be nice. 
 When would I have to start? 
 Today, if possible? 
 There's already water damage. 
 Today is perfect for you. 
 Isn't it? 
 Today does work perfect. Thank you. 
 [♪] 
 I've saved a prime spot for you, right in the middle. 
 I can't wait to see you. 
 I... I-I mean, your photos. 
 Till tomorrow, then. 
 Who was that? 
 John Bowman. 
 Amazing photographer from Tacoma. 
 I've been showing his work the past few months. Big seller. 
 I can see why. It's beautiful. 
 Dreamily : So is he. 
 And so are these pieces. 
 I've sold three bracelets and one painting already this morning. 
 Wow! That's great. 
 Yes, it is. People are really drawn to your work. 
 So pack up and get out. 
 I am giving you a booth in the Art Walk tomorrow. 
 Really? 
 I mean, are you sure? 
 It's just the Art Walk, Justine, not the Louvre. 
 Don't worry! You're ready for this. 
 Ready for what? 
 Seth! What are you doing here? 
 [Seth laughs] 
 Bilge pump malfunction. 
 Had to return to port for repairs. It's going to take a few days so I figured I'd fly home, check to see if you'd sank my boat yet. 
 Not yet. 
 So what's goin' on? Went over to Moon's, he said you were here. 
 Not for long. This girl's going places. 
 Maryellen wants to give me a booth at the Art Walk. 
 Big time! 
 So help her set up. 
 Tell her she's awesome. 
 I don't have time to hold her hand right now. 
 My pleasure. 
 [♪] 
 Hey, Moon. 
 Hey. 
 What's new? 
 Dead body. 
 Excuse me? 
 Last night over at the Thyme and Tide. 
 This dude checks in... then he checks out. 
 What, he died? 
 Well, he ain't pining for the fjords. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Peggy Beldon found him in his room this morning. 
 Already cold. 
 Apparently his hands and face were all bloody. 
 What happened to him? 
 Well, nobody knows. 
 What's more, no one knows who he is or where he came from. 
 No I.D. on him? 
 Nothing. 
 What's the prognosis? 
 Looks like there's a hole in the pipe. 
 Probably from somebody driving a nail through the paneling to hang a picture or something. 
 Can you fix it? 
 Oh, yeah. No problem. 
 As long as my dad has all the right tools. 
 I left mine at my girlfriend's. 
 She probably tossed them or sold them already. 
 Any hope of reconciliation? 
 I don't know. 
 We'll see what happens. 
 Have you spoken to her since you broke up? 
 No. 
 I'm not really in a big hurry to get back to Vancouver, if that's what you're hinting at. 
 I'm really glad you want to stay here in Cedar Cove. 
 If you like, I could spread the word about you. 
 A reliable handyman's hard to find. 
 Thanks. Maybe hold off on that. 
 I'm not really sure construction work is really my thing anymore. 
 Oh. 
 Well, what is... your thing? 
 That's what I'm trying to figure out. 
 Right. 
 Well... we better get back to work. 
 Gentlemen. 
 Nothing much to report yet, Jack. 
 I don't want people jumping to conclusions. 
 Well, this is real news, sheriff. 
 Let's just wait till we have a cause of death before we upset folks. 
 I understand that his hands and face were all bloody. 
 Where'd you hear that? 
 Oh, just... everyone. Everywhere. 
 [Sighs] Great. 
 Bob... 
 You need to keep Peggy off the phone. 
 Aw, come on, Troy. 
 She's been traumatized. 
 I mean, when she gets like this, she feels the need to reach out to someone. 
 Listen, sheriff. 
 You think maybe he was in a fight? 
 Bloody knuckles, cut to his forehead? 
 You get hit hard enough, get a concussion, you can die from that. 
 Let's wait and see what the coroner says. 
 Right now, I need some information. 
 Now, the pick-up truck that dropped him off... 
 What color was it? 
 Uh, gray. 
 Silver? Um... 
 Light blue. 
 It was hard to tell in the middle of the night. 
 Okay, let me get this straight. 
 We don't know who the guy was, how he died, who dropped him off. 
 Now there's a truck involved that may or may not be blue, gray, or silver? 
 That's not a lot to go on there, sheriff. 
 I need to make some calls. 
 This is crazy, Jack. 
 A bloody stranger shows up in the middle of the night, from who knows where, he goes to sleep, and ends up dead. 
 In this town, we call that insanity. 
 In Philly, we call that Tuesday. 
 [♪] 
 [Saw roaring] 
 Whoa! What happened here? 
 Stan! 
 Is this a bad time? 
 No, no. Just fixing a leak. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Um, your mom asked me to just check around for an art broker, someone who might be interested in selling Tom Harting's Western memorabilia. 
 So... I found a guy in King County. 
 Big fan of Harting's music. 
 You drive all the way here? 
 Well, I had to see a patient anyway... 
 And seemed like it was a big deal to Charlotte. 
 She was eager to find someone. 
 I would've delivered it myself, but, uh... 
 I've got to get back, so... 
 And you know how your mother likes to talk. 
 Really? I hadn't noticed. 
 [She chuckles] 
 Oh, big news! 
 Justine got a display at the Art Walk. 
 Her jewelry pieces. Remember? 
 I told you she's making those earrings and bracelets? 
 Oh! Right, right. 
 They're even gonna let her show some of her paintings and sculptures. 
 Wow. That's terrific. 
 Yeah! 
 Well, I'll try to go by and check it out. 
 She'd really like that. 
 Well, I, uh... I better get back. 
 Good seeing you. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I was thinking that, uh... if that stranger did have a fight with someone, maybe the guy followed him here to finish him off. 
 I wouldn't worry about that. 
 Maybe he's coming back here to finish us off. 
 Come on, Peg. Why would he do that? 
 Maybe he thinks we can identify him. 
 We didn't even see him. 
 Or maybe it's someone we know, Bob. 
 Maybe he... the guy dropped him off right here, at our front door. 
 Hey. Hey, honey. 
 You need to settle down here. 
 Nothing bad is gonna happen to us, okay? 
 Okay. 
 We're going to be just fine. 
 [Knocks] 
 Busy? 
 No. Come on in. 
 Well, well... 
 I see Eric has been working hard. 
 How's it going? 
 Um... good. Good. 
 What's up? 
 Uh, listen... 
 I know we had made a date to go sailing tomorrow, however, I may need to go in to work. 
 I don't know if you've heard what happened with the Thyme and Tide? 
 The man who died. 
 Yes. My mom called me. 
 Of course she did. Yeah. 
 It's a big story. 
 It is. Yes, it is. 
 Bit of a mystery who this guy was, and, uh, where he came from. 
 Where is Eric? 
 I don't know. 
 I, um, came back from court, and he was gone. 
 Maybe he's gone out to get a part or something. 
 [Guitar playing] 
 I didn't know you could cook. 
 Chili, scrambled eggs... 
 The occasional cheeseburger, that about covers it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So I stopped by the courthouse. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 You left a big hole in the wall. 
 Gotta let it dry. 
 It's okay, I know what I'm doin'. 
 I'm not gonna embarrass you in front of your girlfriend. 
 Oh, I know. Just, um... 
 Take care of it. 
 All right, now onto the jalapenos. 
 No. 
 You can't put jalapenos in there. 
 I'm allergic. 
 Capsaicin. Nothing spicy. 
 Of course. Right. 
 Right. I-I knew that. 
 By the way, who's Stan? 
 He, uh, he came by to visit Olivia. 
 Oh! That's Olivia's ex-husband. 
 That's weird. 
 Why? What'd he want? 
 Uh, something about... 
 Her mom wanting him to find an art broker or something. 
 What's weird about that? 
 I don't know. They seemed kind of close. 
 Me and my exes, whenever we're in the same room together, we just try to strangle each other. 
 Smothered him, huh? 
 With the pillow. 
 Yeah, but the pillow was still on the bed. 
 Yeah, but he could've put it back afterward, then climbed back out and made his getaway. 
 That's a pretty small window. 
 Yeah. Look, you don't think there's a chance of him coming back here again, do you? 
 You really worried about that? 
 I don't know. Peggy's got me thinking. 
 Morning, sheriff. Bob. 
 How goes the investigation? 
 Well, I don't have anything new for you, Jack. 
 No word from the coroner yet. 
 No "missing persons" reports. 
 Any luck finding the truck driver? 
 DMV sent me a list of gray, light-blue, and silver pick-ups registered in the area. 
 Deputies are checking it out now. 
 Did you check in with the bars in the area, see if there were any fights that night? 
 Yup. Followed up on that. 
 So far, nothing. 
 No, we just have to be patient. 
 I'm sure the coroner's report will go a long way to figure out what happened. 
 Radio crackles : Sheriff Davis, come in. 
 Yeah. Go ahead. 
 We just got a call from Silverdale P.D. 
 Excuse me. 
 So... [sighs] 
 How are you holding up, Bob? 
 Uh, okay. 
 Peggy's convinced she's got P.T.S.D. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 [Door shuts as engine starts] 
 Oh! Hey. 
 [Thumping] 
 Hold up! What's going on? 
 A few hours before John Doe arrived here, two guys robbed a convenience store in Silverdale. 
 Clerk put up a fight, and one of the thieves tumbled through the front window, shattering it before running off. 
 That's our guy! 
 And the other is his accomplice, or maybe his killer! 
 Hey, what do you think you're doing? 
 Well, I'm coming with you. 
 Hah! No way. 
 Last thing I need is you getting hurt. 
 Sheriff, the cops in Philly they let me do ride-alongs all the time, all right? 
 Their cars have bullet-proof windows, don't they? 
 Probably. 
 You're staying here. 
 Oh! You're here. 
 How's it going? 
 Good. 
 Just gonna grab a few things and get out of your way. 
 Did you tell my dad I messed this job up? 
 No. 
 'Cause I told you, you gotta let this dry out. 
 You patch too soon, you get mold. 
 You didn't tell me, but thank you for telling me now. 
 What have you got against me? 
 [Awkward chuckle] 
 Nothing. 
 No one forced you to take this job. 
 I'm serious. You could've said no. 
 Right. 
 I haven't seen my dad in years. 
 I'm trying to make a good impression, and I'm gonna tell his girlfriend "No" when she offers me a job? 
 I know it must be hard to come here. 
 No. No. 
 You don't know me. Okay? 
 And neither does my dad. 
 He doesn't know a thing about me. 
 He wants to know you. 
 He is thrilled to have you back in his life. 
 He's worked really hard to turn his life around. 
 Yeah? 
 How long's it been this time? 
 'Cause he's turned his life around many times before. 
 It's a day-to-day struggle. 
 Something he has to deal with for the rest of his life. 
 Tell me about it. 
 
 
 
 [♪] 
 [Frustrated sigh] 
 You okay? 
 Of course I'm okay. Why wouldn't I be okay? 
 I'm showing my artwork today. 
 I'm baring my naked soul for the world to see, leaving myself open to ridicule. 
 So... not okay? 
 It's terrifying, putting yourself out there for people to judge you. 
 But you're still here, right? 
 That's gotta count for something. 
 I guess so. 
 It's pretty brave, if you ask me. 
 Is that supposed to make me feel better? 
 Yep. 
 It does. 
 You're very sensitive. 
 That's just the kind of guy I am. 
 I was at the Captain's Galley earlier. 
 Heard you had dinner with Warren Saget. 
 What's wrong with people? 
 Why can't they just mind their own business? 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Because it didn't matter to me. 
 I didn't think it was worth mentioning. 
 Justine... you tell me you had skinless chicken for lunch because you ate cookies for breakfast. 
 You tell me every detail of your life, but you don't mention you went out with your ex-fiance? 
 I didn't "go out" with him. 
 I was there on my own. 
 Warren showed up and asked if he could join me. 
 [Sighs] 
 I just don't trust him. 
 Well, you don't have to trust him. 
 You just have to trust me. 
 Okay, ma'am. Sorry to trouble you. 
 Thanks for your time. 
 Howdy, sheriff! 
 I thought I told you to stay away. 
 I've got a job to do, Troy, just like you. 
 I take it she's not our guy? 
 No. 
 Now, look, sheriff. 
 I can keep following you, or... 
 I could keep you company. 
 [Scoffs] All right. 
 Keep quiet and do what I tell you. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Ahh... 
 So, who's next on your list? 
 That's being quiet? 
 Lucas West. 23 Crepe Myrtle Road. 
 Hoo. Way out in the boonies. 
 I thought we already were out in the boonies. 
 [Chuckling] 
 You miss the city, don't ya? 
 Oh... sometimes. 
 The energy... pace. 
 The crime. 
 Hey, at least I always had something to write about. 
 Here, it's always just so... 
 Peaceful. 
 Don't you ever miss having more of a challenge? 
 Well, if that means more people hurting or stealing from each other, then no. 
 I'll take Cedar Cove just like it is. 
 Safe... quiet. 
 Neighbors look out for one another. 
 And everybody knows everyone else's business. 
 I'm telling you, the man was murdered. 
 He and his accomplice, they robbed the convenience store, smashing the window, and that's how he got all those cuts on his hands and face. 
 So, they're on the run, but they decide to split up. 
 Now, John Doe he's bleeding... 
 So his accomplice drops him off at the Thyme and Tide so he can clean up the wounds... 
 So then, the accomplice, well, he starts worryin' that the John Doe dude is gonna talk, maybe rat him out to the cops. 
 So he sneaks back to the Thyme and Tide, climbs in the window, and... 
 [Chop] 
 [Gravel crunching] 
 Wow, this really is the boonies. 
 Well, folks living this far out don't like to be disturbed. 
 Hey, sheriff, come look at this. 
 That's blood. 
 Go wait in the car. 
 Shouldn't we call for back-up? 
 Go wait in the car. 
 Are you Lucas West? 
 I am. 
 Did you drop a man off at the Thyme and Tide Bed and Breakfast two nights ago? 
 That a crime? 
 Mr. West, what's your connection to this man? 
 I didn't have one. 
 I just gave him a lift. Why? 
 He's dead. 
 Dead? 
 What happened to him? 
 I was hoping you'd tell me. 
 I don't know anything about him. 
 When I dropped him off, he was fine. 
 But he was bleeding. 
 There's blood on the side of your truck. 
 He was like that when I picked him up. 
 Are you trying to pin this on me? 
 So where did you pick him up? 
 On my way home from work in Silverdale. 
 Found him sitting on the side of the road. 
 Did he give you a name? 
 Yeah. Howard. 
 He mention a last name? 
 He didn't tell me, and I didn't ask him. 
 Just said to take him to the nearest motel. 
 All right, well, uh, I'll need a name and number to confirm your employment, plus the location of where you picked up this, uh... "Howard." 
 [♪] 
 [Knocking] 
 Excuse me, your honor, but the Art Walk is calling. 
 Holy moly... What is all this? 
 I hired Eric to fix a leak. 
 Well, then, where is he? 
 He doesn't seem to be in a big hurry to get the job finished. 
 So you still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt? 
 He does have a chip on his shoulder. 
 A lot of resentment built up over the years. 
 Probably drives him crazy, seeing his dad turning his life around while his is still miserable. 
 Just be careful. 
 That kid is manipulating Jack, and I don't want to see him manipulating you too. 
 Pretty soon he just has to step up and take control of his life and stop playing the victim. 
 In the meantime, this, uh, this wall is not gonna patch itself. 
 You know how to do that? 
 You live with Mr. fix-it for a while, and you pick up a thing or two. 
 I have to see this. 
 Everything is looking really fantastic, but if you ladies could just do me a favor and go over there and make sure that area is secure, that would be amazing. 
 This looks so great. You know what? 
 If you want to just put maybe a few more candles in here, just to perk it up, I think that would look fantastic. 
 This is great! 
 You've done an amazing job. 
 I have, haven't I? 
 How I get people to stop and look at my stuff? 
 You have to engage with the public. 
 You know? Draw people in. 
 Be an advocate for your art! 
 What am I supposed to do? Jump up and down? 
 Do bird calls? 
 Good idea. 
 I should go say hello to John. 
 Mr. Bowman. 
 It's so exciting to see you here. 
 We don't always have the actual artist present at the show. 
 Really? 
 People are really responding to your work. 
 The composition... The sharp depth of field. 
 That's great. 
 People always ask me about your process, what goes into crafting your style. 
 I tell them I don't really know. 
 I mean, I've only known you for a few months, and we've never really talked much. 
 We should maybe talk more. 
 You wanna talk more? 
 I mean about your approach with your work. 
 So that I can accurately represent your process. 
 Yeah, but do people really want to hear about all that stuff? 
 And I don't think I could explain. 
 Oh, no, you shouldn't have to. 
 The work speaks for itself. 
 It's no one's business, right? 
 It's not that. 
 You just keep doing what you do, and I'll keep selling you. 
 I mean, your art. 
 Great. 
 Sounds good. 
 I appreciate it. 
 Anyway, um... 
 I should keep circulating. 
 Give a holler if you need anything. 
 "Give a holler"? You idiot. 
 Well, it's right about here that he said he picked him up. 
 How far are we from Silverdale? 
 Well, 20 Miles or so. 
 Those two thieves escaped on foot. 
 That's probably too far for that Howard guy to have walked all this way. 
 Hey, what's that? See it? 
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
 [Shutter snaps] 
 Let's have a look at that. 
 Is it Howard's? 
 I don't know. Broken, or the battery's dead. 
 Radio crackles : Sheriff Davis, come in. 
 Be right back. 
 Keep looking, see if you can find anything else. 
 [♪] 
 Warren : I'm serious, Justine. 
 Look, you should have your own gallery and studio space. 
 Warren... 
 Look, just... Just hear me out. 
 Remember the vacant storefront I showed you? 
 Right? It's still on the market. 
 You say the word and I'll buy it for you. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 Let's discuss it over dinner. 
 Strictly business. 
 I don't think so. 
 Justine, come on, this is an opportunity that... 
 Warren. 
 Thank you for the offer, but no. 
 Okay. 
 Offer stays on the table, okay? 
 Just think about it, and just let me know if you change your mind. 
 Okay? 
 I'm glad to see you. 
 I just talked to the boat. 
 Bilge pump's fixed. I gotta go back today. 
 Oh. 
 Well, I'm glad I got to see you, even if it was only for a day. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm glad I came back too. 
 [♪] 
 Hey, honey! Look who I found. 
 Dad? What are you doing here? 
 Oh, are you kidding me? 
 My daughter's in the Art Walk. I wouldn't miss it. 
 Starkwater Lake. 
 Took me a long time to go back there after Jordan... but it was his favorite place in the world, so I thought it was worth trying to capture. 
 You did, sweetheart. 
 It's beautiful. 
 I wasn't sure how you'd feel about it. 
 Brings up a lot of memories. 
 I... I try not to think about it. 
 How's that work? 
 I can't do that. 
 Just block out all of the things that hurt? 
 They're just there. 
 They're always just there. 
 [Taking his hand] 
 [Crow caws] 
 Well, don't touch anything. 
 No, I won't. 
 I assume this is the getaway car. 
 Nope. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, that call I just got? 
 Both thieves were just arrested. 
 So Howard wasn't part of the robbery? 
 No. 
 Well, then who was he? 
 [Keys clacking rapidly] 
 Typing furiously! Sounds like a scoop. 
 Oh... 
 I am just getting started. 
 The case of the mysterious dead guy has been solved, and you... can read all about it in tomorrow's  Chronicle. 
 I'm looking forward to it. 
 So, what's up? 
 Um... 
 [Sighing] 
 Eric didn't finish, did he? 
 Well, no, but maybe he would have, eventually. 
 It was just taking too long, so Grace did it. 
 She's surprisingly good at patching walls. 
 I just don't want this to be a problem between us. 
 Maybe I shouldn't have offered him the job in the first place. 
 No, Olivia, you were just trying to help out, and I appreciate it. Okay? 
 The problem is that he's too much like his old man. 
 When I was his age, I jumped around from job to job. 
 I couldn't focus long enough to get anything done. 
 That's the problem. 
 Okay? I mean, I'm just... just gonna have to talk to him, that's all. 
 Well, when you do, may I suggest, try not to put too much of the blame on yourself. 
 I'm the reason he is where he is. 
 He can't go through his life blaming you. 
 You've taken responsibility for your mistakes, and maybe it's time he did the same. 
 Well, the thing is, I don't want to undo all the positive steps that we've taken either, okay? 
 I mean, we're really starting to get along well now. 
 I know, but maybe what he needs right now is not so much a friend, but a father. 
 I know how hard this is... 
 I appreciate your concern, Olivia, but I'm gonna deal with this in my own way. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I should get back to work. 
 [Door closes] 
 He wasn't a fugitive? 
 No more than you or me. 
 Well, then who was he? 
 Jack's voice : "His name was Howard Miller. 
 According to flight records,  he left Boston on Wednesday morning  and flew into SeaTac airport,  where he rented a car and headed north. He was driving along Old Clifton Road when his tire blew out, causing him to control of the vehicle and skid off the road." 
 [Crash] 
 "Mr. Miller attempted to remove the flat tire..."  [Gasps in pain]  sustaining several lacerations in the process. Ultimately, he did manage to take off the tire... But unfortunately, the spare was damaged and unusable." 
 "As if things couldn't get any worse for Mr. Miller, any hopes of calling for a taxi or roadside assistance were dashed by a dead cell phone battery." 
 "And so, he sat on the side of the road. Frustration turned to despair, and, by this point, he had all but given up until a man named Lucas West offered him a ride." [Engine idling] "The kindness of a stranger was the lone bright spot in his otherwise horrible day." Then, Mr. West dropped him off here, and... and you know the rest. No. Troy, we don't. How did the man die? It was a heart attack. You say he was from Boston? Yeah, he was a writer for a big national magazine here to do a profile on the Art Walk. So he wasn't murdered, and he wasn't a thief? No. And he wasn't here to make trouble. He was here to shine a light on something good about our town. Charlotte : And I've been awful. I let my imagination get away from me. I know I did. We all did. [Jovial whistling in hall] Oh... Who did that? Don't worry about it. I came to finish it. Eric, it was just taking too long. Where do I get paid? You can't be serious. Look, I know I didn't finish, but I still put in a lot of work here. The clerk's office, second floor. I don't have exact figures yet, but I'm sure we had more visitors than last year's Art Walk, with an increase in overall sales. You coordinating again next year? Mm, absolutely! I want to expand on this year's success. I told you it would be great! And you did a wonderful job, sweetheart. I want you to write that down... "She did a wonderful job." Thank you. Excuse me. I just wish I could say the same about your son. Nobody has a bigger heart than Olivia, and I'm sorry, but I cannot stand to see anybody take advantage of her. It's great seeing Seth again. Yeah. I mean, we just started dating again. It's not serious. Justine, I, uh... I know that I haven't really been around that much for you. No. You haven't. I just want you to know that I'm gonna try very hard to change that. I want to believe you. I understand. I have to earn your trust first. [Footsteps] Maryellen : What'd I tell you? People loved you! Your display was a big hit. She has been a godsend at the gallery. I finally have someone there who knows almost as much about art as I do. So, what do you think? You wanna make it a permanent position? You mean come work for you at the gallery? Well, unless you're committed to your waitressing career at Moon's. Goodbye, Moon's! 9:30, sharp. Ohh! Congratulations, sweetheart. Oh! That's great. Uh, I'm just gonna take this to the car. I'll be back. Thank you so much for being here for her. It may not seem like it, but it means the world to her. [♪] [Shuts drawer] Hey. There you are. Didn't hear you leave this morning. Yeah, I wanted to get an early start on the want ads. Anything good? A few leads. Good. "Come to the marina A.S.A.P." I heard you didn't have court today. Thought maybe we could try that sailing date. Where's Eric? Looking for a job. I hope. Today, however, is all about us. I got sandwiches from Moon's, I've rented this alarmingly little sailboat, I've taken a fist full of dramamine. Now all I need is an instructor. Well, I have to warn you, I'm not the most experienced sailor. Something could go horribly wrong. I see. Well... In that case... I can't imagine anyone I would rather be lost at sea with. ♪ You are more ♪
