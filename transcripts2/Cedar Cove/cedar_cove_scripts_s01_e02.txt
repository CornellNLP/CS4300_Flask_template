 Please don't ever bring a cup of coffee... 
 Into my courtroom again. 
 Oh, well, I was just... 
 It seems congratulations are in order. 
 All it says is that I'm being considered for Federal Judgeship. 
 I want you to break off the engagement. 
 You're not really acting very ethical right now, your honor. 
 You're not gonna hurt my daughter.

 Cedar Cove 01x02 
A House Divided 
Original Air Date July 27, 2013 
 Hey, Grace! 
 What are you doing here? 
 You're not supposed to be home till Sunday. 
 Gee, thanks. I missed you, too. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Welcome home! 
 Thank you! [Laughs] 
 I just didn't want to go to my place. 
 I wanted to come here first. 
 I'm glad. 
 How was Sedona? 
 It was amazing. 
 The sun and the red rocks were so beautiful. 
 Perfect place to just go and relax and feel sorry for myself. 
 Well, you look great. 
 Why don't we make some tea, put our feet up and talk? 
 Okay. 
 [Exhales wearily] 
 Dan mailed our divorce papers to the hotel. 
 Guess he's in a hurry to make it official. 
 Room service delivered them with my morning coffee. 
 That's horrible. 
 Just completely ruined my pity-party vacation. 
 That's why I came back early. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 You can only do so much yoga and meditation before you start to get sick of your own inner-child. 
 Well, Dan's an idiot, and I'm glad to have you home. 
 Have I told you how much I appreciate you for being there for me throughout this whole thing? 
 God knows you've been here for me! 
 Well, I'm very grateful. 
 So... I brought you this lovely souvenir. 
 It's a rock. 
 It's from Sedona! 
 I didn't have time to shop. 
 Oh, Grace! 
 You're gonna be alright. 
 I promise. 
 How do you know this? 
 I feel like my life is over! 
 Because I know you. 
 You're beautiful and kind and smart... and you have me. 
 This isn't the end of anything. 
 It's a new beginning. 
 A new chapter. 
 An exciting adventure! 
 Are you using book metaphors because I'm a librarian? 
 Too much? 
 Nah, it's okay. Keep going. 
 You are the author of your life. 
 You get to decide what storyline comes next! 
 It's your sequel! 
 Can I be taller and thinner? 
 Why not? 
 [♪] 
 So, Paul, from here to here. 
 Okay, now, I know you've got to probably take out a few trees as well, that's fine, but try to avoid this one here... 
 That's a selling point. 
 It's a beautiful oak, but... 
 [Gravel crunching] 
 I'll be right back, okay? 
 Called your office. They said you were out here. 
 Sorry to interrupt, but, um... 
 I've been leaving you messages, you don't return my calls... 
 I'm sorry, honey, I just... 
 I've been really busy lately, that's all. 
 What's going on? 
 Oh! 
 I'm just working out the logistics to tearing down the lighthouse. 
 Tear down the lighthouse? 
 Yeah, Justine. I own the property. 
 I've been trying to sell it for two years now. 
 But I've changed my strategy. 
 You see, I'm going to level the land, and build up a new estate. 
 Warren, no, you can't tear down the lighthouse. 
 It's been here forever. 
 It means a lot to people in town. 
 Look, I don't have time to discuss this right now. 
 Let's talk about it later. 
 Now, look, you came down here. 
 If you have something to say, say it. 
 If not, I've really got to get back to this. 
 [♪] 
 I'm breaking off our engagement. 
 I can't marry you. 
 Okay, wait a sec. What is go... wh... what're you doing? 
 You're breaking up with me? 
 We were never a good fit. 
 We both know it. 
 You know what? You're right. 
 You're absolutely right. I have been avoiding you. 
 I've just been trying to figure out in my own head how to tell you the exact same thing. 
 [Scoffs lightly] What? 
 That you were gonna break up with me? 
 Yes, and I should've done it earlier. 
 I'm sorry, I just, uh... 
 I just didn't want to hurt you. 
 That's fine. 
 You want to be the one who officially ends this... 
 It's the truth, Justine. I was gonna come over... 
 I don't care. Go ahead. Tell them all that you dumped me. 
 I'm fine with it. 
 You know what? I don't have time to talk like this. 
 Okay? You're making a scene. 
 I've got a lighthouse to tear down. 
 [♪] 
 Are you kidding me? A Federal Judgeship? 
 Something you have dreamed about since, like, forever. 
 How could you turn that down? 
 I don't know, I just was afraid I'd miss Cedar Cove, and my family and my friends, I was afraid I'd get homesick. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no. You... 
 You are hiding something. 
 No! 
 Yes, there's more to this. 
 No, I... it just didn't feel right. 
 [Door thuds] 
 Mom! 
 What're you doing here? 
 Uh, I live here, last time I checked. 
 I thought you weren't coming home until Sunday. 
 No. The email I sent you specifically said today. 
 Oh, gosh! I am so sorry. 
 It has been totally crazy. 
 The last few days, I can't even keep my head on straight. 
 Oh, just the last few days? 
 Catch up later? I am so late for work. 
 [Laughs] Go! 
 Both : Mwah! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Is she ever not late? 
 [Both chuckle briefly] 
 Are you okay? 
 [Sniffles] 
 26 years of marriage. 
 A lifetime of memories. 
 I just... I never thought I'd be starting over again at my age. 
 I know... just don't look backwards, look forwards. 
 It's time to build new memories. 
 [Disgusted grunt] You. 
 All positive and uplifting. 
 Of course I am! I learned from you. 
 Oh, yes, you did. 
 Wow. It's beautiful. 
 Thank you. [Giggles] 
 We want to run an ad in the paper. 
 First or second page. 
 We want to reach everyone in town. 
 Well, why don't you just stand in the middle of the road and shout? 
 I'm sorry. My idea of small-town humor. 
 Um, okay, so you want to buy an ad? 
 Yeah, the Thyme and Tide. 
 Yeah, we are the go-to bed-and-breakfast in the area. 
 And yes, I know, before you even say it, we are... 
 The only bed-and-breakfast in the area. 
 [All chuckling] 
 We just added wifi to all the rooms. 
 People need the Facebook. 
 Oh, they do. 
 So, have you thought about what this ad should say? 
 Uh, something catchy and provocative. 
 s*x sells! 
 Oh, it does. 
 You know, something that really grabs your attention. 
 "Once you sleep with us, you'll never want to sleep with anyone else." 
 That actually might be too provocative. 
 Really? 
 Yeah! 
 Y... uh... I-I see what you mean. Yeah. 
 I'll tell you what, guys. 
 I will come up something tonight and put it in the paper tomorrow. 
 Right between Warren Saget tearing down the lighthouse and the new Apple Store... 
 Which, as it turns out, just sells apples. 
 Warren Saget's going to tear down the Cedar Cove Lighthouse? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 No. 
 That's not possible. 
 Well, he says he owns the land, the lighthouse hasn't been used in years. 
 He's gonna demolish it and build a home. 
 He can't do that. 
 That lighthouse is over a hundred years old. 
 They say that the man in the statue in front of City Hall is the one who built it. 
 That lighthouse saved countless lives. 
 Mine among them. 
 Bob used to work as a fisherman. 
 That lighthouse means a lot to us. 
 So... [sighs heavily] 
 This really is big news? 
 He's not going to get away with it. 
 You need to write about this, let people know what's happening. 
 You'll print  that on the front page. 
 Okay. [Exhales] 
 Peggy, Bob... I'm on it. 
 Cooperton's Center just closed. 
 We've taken in some of their patients. 
 Just tell me who to look after. 
 These came in in the last two days. 
 A "John Doe"? 
 Oh, it's a sad case. 
 A stroke victim found unconscious on a bench in the bus station a few weeks ago. 
 No wallet or I.D. 
 He might've been robbed, we don't know. 
 Oh! That's terrible! 
 Well, to make matters worse, the stroke left him unable to speak, so no one knows who the man is, where he comes from. 
 No one's inquired about him, so we don't know if he even has any family. 
 I gotta run. Thank you so much again! 
 And, I mean, a Federal Judgeship doesn't come along every day, Olivia. 
 I'm aware of that. 
 Well, I just want to make sure you thought this thing through. 
 This was a difficult decision. 
 I didn't make it lightly. 
 Hey! 
 Oh, hey! Hey. 
 Oh! Oh, Grace, this is Jack Griffith. 
 He's the new editor of  The Chronicle. 
 Hello. 
 Hello back. 
 So, you... look great, as usual. 
 [Giggles] 
 We, um, we still on for dinner? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Good. Excellent. 
 [Awkward chuckle] 
 Go ahead, kiss her. 
 Don't mind me. Seriously. 
 Yeah... 
 Right. 
 Uh, you know what? 
 I actually have to get back to work. 
 So, Grace, pleasure meeting you. 
 Oh, trust me, Jack, pleasure was all mine. 
 Yeah... 
 [Giggles] 
 I'll see you later. 
 Okay. 
 So he's the reason you turned down the judgeship. 
 No. No. It's nothing serious. 
 Of course not. 
 You're just friends, right? 
 Yeah. Got it. 
 One large non-fat latte, extra whip cream, hold the irony. 
 This new bracelet you made. 
 You like it? 
 It's awesome. 
 You think everything is "awesome." 
 Ah, which, when you consider it in the grander scheme of things, is in and of itself awesome. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey! 
 Hey... 
 I heard you wanted to talk to me. What's up? 
 Yeah. Um... 
 I... I just wanted to let you know that I... 
 [Takes a breath] broke off my engagement to Warren. 
 Glad I could brighten your day. 
 No, honey! You know I want what's best for you. 
 How did he take it? 
 He was upset, which was weird, because he claimed he was gonna break up with me. 
 Really? 
 It's all for the best, especially considering what he's about to do. 
 What's that? 
 Okay, everyone, can I have your attention? 
 Warren Saget wants to tear down the Cedar Cove Lighthouse. 
 I'm looking for some signatures. 
 Radio :  You're listening to Delilah. 
 Why focus on the past when you can't do a thing about it? 
 Someone very wise once said, "never look back, unless you plan on going that way." Hello. I'm Charlotte Jeffers, one of the volunteers here. I check in with the patients, make sure they're comfortable, visit with them... Whether they like it or not. Uh, I know you can't speak, but it's okay. I do enough talking for the both of us. You comfortable? I want to make sure your stay here is as nice as... Have we met before? Because you look familiar. Give me a second, okay? Gentlemen. How can I help you? I just want to hand you this petition, signed by nearly every resident of Cedar Cove, demanding you stop any plans to tear down that lighthouse. [Amused chuckle] Look, Bob, I appreciate your concern, I do, but we all know the real estate market is still struggling, right? So I really have no choice but to rebuild on  my  property in order to change the value. The lighthouse is a historic landmark. Well, no, it isn't, actually. Really? Yeah. A structure that old has no historic building protection? I mean, I've seen buildings half as old as that fall under the protection of the state. No. But feel free to check out the town records, if you'd like. I don't care about the town records. I care about the townspeople, and the people will not let you tear it down. Alright, look, I understand that you have to make this make sense to you economically, I get that, but maybe there's a way to do both. I mean, why not build around the lighthouse, or actually incorporate it into the project that you're building? You know, turn it into a bonus r... I own the property, Jack, which means what? I can do whatever I want to do with it. Not you. Me. And there's nothing you or this town's gonna do to stop it. Understand? Warren, come on. You have to live with these people. Do you really want to alienate your neighbors like this? Just like you said, Jack. It's all about economics. [Snickers] Yeah, but you're treating this like it's New York City and you're Donald Trump. You do realize this is just Mayberry, right? Oh, you do realize this has nothing to do with you, right? Bob. Yeah, well, it has something to do with me, and I will be damned if I'll let you do it! Alright, Bob. Bob... we're gonna make this work. How? Well, for starters, you now have the full force of the media behind you. Yeah? Well, I'd like to have the full force of my fist behind him. Moon : "The rocky ledge runs far into the sea, and on its outer point, some miles away, the lighthouse lifts its massive masonry... a pillar of fire by night, of cloud by day. And as the evening darkens, lo... how bright, through the deep purple..." Whoa. Yeah. "Deep Purple." [Moon chuckles] Uh, "...The deep purple of... Of the twilight air, "beams forth the sudden radiance of its light with strange, unearthly splendor in the glare." Thought you were on a fishing boat in Alaska. I was, just a few days. Filling in for someone who was sick. Now I'm back. For how long? Till the next job. Who knows? I heard a rumor that... you broke things off with Warren. Not a rumor. So now that you're single again... you up for me taking you to dinner sometime? I think that could be arranged. When? How 'bout right now? [♪] No, I mean, seriously, the guy was fuming. I honestly thought for a minute there, that punches were gonna be thrown. It's not over. I know Bob Beldon. He does not give up easy. [Laughing] Yeah! I kinda got that! Fortunately, I do think I've steered him in a slightly different direction. Oh, and what would... That be? Hey! Hey! Seth! So nice to see you. I didn't know you were back in town. I can barely keep track myself. Kids, oh, um... This is Jack Griffith. He's the new editor of  The Chronicle. This is my daughter... Justine. Oh! Hey! And her friend, Seth. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. And, Justine... You work at Moon's. I do! And you're the guy that keeps us in business. Yeah! That's right. I go there every day. I probably buy, what, like 10 cups of coffees a day? If I had known you were dating my mom, I would've offered you the friends-and-family discount. No, no. We were just having... There you go! Dinner. I was just making a joke. A really bad joke. Anyway, um... we should get a table. You could join us, but we're almost through. No! No, um... We wouldn't want to interrupt your... your dinner. It was nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. Mutters : Awkward. So... I'm confused. This isn't a date? It is. I'm sorry. I... I just haven't said anything to her, and I was thrown seeing her on a date. She just got out of this relationship. Ahh. Do you think she is going to have a problem with you dating again? I don't know. I don't think so. And if she does... she will just have to get used to it. Now, you see, that sounds much better to me. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, local ordinance places no limitations on the garden gnomes in residential front yards, whether one gnome or the defendant's 57, you're allowed to have as many as you want. There are also no laws against... unusual taste. With that in mind, I must find for the defendant. [Gavel thuds] Hi, Bob. What's up? Well, actually, I'm here on official business, your honor. I'm taking matters to the next step. And "the next step" would be? I'm filing a motion, on behalf of the entire town, for a preliminary injunction preventing the demolition of the Cedar Cove Lighthouse, on the grounds that it's a historic building and thusly protected. Thusly? Did you just use the word "thusly"? I did. So, um... The matter is now officially in your hands. Good day. 
 
 [♪] [Ambivalent sigh] Ohh... Warren! Oh, look, please, can it wait, Olivia? I'm late for a meeting. It's about this lighthouse matter. Look, I sent you the proper paperwork on the deal. You have enough to make your ruling. Why are you doing this? A custom-built estate, Olivia, a scene over the cove, is gonna sell a whole lot quicker than a crumbling old eyesore. I thought you cared about this town, about what people think about you. And I do. Why make yourself a pariah? You tear down the lighthouse, people are gonna hate you. Yeah, short-term, maybe, but you see, I'm thinking big picture. Look, I make improvements on this property, not only do I raise its value, I raise the value of all the other pieces of property in this town. You see, everyone's gonna benefit from it. Seriously? That's what you're thinking? Look, Olivia, times change. Now, we both know that, sooner or later, that building's coming down. I just happen to be the only one who's willing to yank off the band-aid. Excuse me. [Knocking at door] I can't talk right now. Fine. Don't talk. Ohh! Hi, Grace. Got your message... that Justine broke off the engagement! So, of course, I had to bake you your favorite chocolate cake. Thank you. You are so welcome. I've been trying to figure out a way to stop this lighthouse disaster, but I can't. Well, you will. You always do. Remember when you ruled the "Seniors for Nature" couldn't use the park for their meetings? Everybody thought you were being so unreasonable, and now they are thanking you for it. That's because they turned out to be a nudist group. Nobody needs to see that. [Chuckles] It's the hardest part of my job, separating emotion from the law. I'm just as upset as everyone else. I've lived here my whole life, I don't want to see the lighthouse torn down. So? Then why didn't you take the Federal Judgeship? Would you stop asking me that? I told you. I didn't want to leave home or my friends. That's right, yes, I do remember you saying that. So, why didn't you take the judgeship? [Sighs wearily] Too much change. I couldn't bring myself to sell my house. All my memories are there, and Jordan's room. And I still feel him there. You know what I mean? Yeah. I guess I just wasn't strong enough to leave. Oh, give me a break. You're the strongest woman I know. So? Did you kiss him yet? Oh! [Laughing] No. It's just a few dates. But I do like him. And he is smart and funny... And gorgeous. And there is that. So when do you think you might kiss him? Give me that fork. [Cake platter scrapes table] [♪] [Galley murmuring] It's going to come out okay. Yeah, I know. All rise. Please be seated. In the matter of the demolition of the Cedar Cove Lighthouse, I have studied the case thoroughly, and although I understand why the people of this town would believe the lighthouse to be an historical building, it turns out it was never legally designated as one. When Mr. Saget purchased the property, he included, in complex legalese and very small print, a small window of time in which the town could pursue landmark status, but it appears that no one took notice of it, or thought that it would be an issue, and that time has now passed. Mr. Saget has since obtained all the necessary permits from the county to make what he calls "improvements" to the property. So... As much as it pains the people of this town, I'm afraid Mr. Saget does have the legal right to tear down the lighthouse, and I must abide by the law. The injunction is declined. [Gavel whacks as angry murmuring rises] Don't worry. We'll fight this. Grace : "Word of Judge Lockhart's ruling quickly spread through town, angering many residents." "By allowing Mr. Saget to proceed with the demolition, Lockhart's ruling brings to an end not just a beloved town landmark, but a building that has become a symbol of Cedar Cove and the people who live here." "For decades, the lighthouse has stood, protecting ships from the rocky shores of Puget Sound. "Oftentimes, on cloudy nights, it was the only light to be found." "Local resident Bob Beldon calls it a stalwart friend who, despite years of rough seas and harsh weather, continues to stand tall.'" Olivia : "And now, after 100 years of service, "the light will be extinguished. "By denying the injunction, Judge Lockhart has effectively given the green light for demolition to begin before the end of the week." [♪] [Distant door creaks] Hey. What are you doing here? Well, I was hoping we could talk. Uh, how are you? Fine. I tried calling you a couple of times, and I didn't hear back. I had to unplug my phone, I was getting so many calls. People have your home phone number? It's a small town. It's like a big family, and families fight. Unfortunately, your article added fuel to the fire. [Exhales tensely] Look, is that going to get in our way? I don't know. Are you looking for something to get in our way? No. 'Cause, look, Olivia, I am just putting one foot in front of the other here, making this up as I go. Okay? So if you are scared, too... I get that. Just don't give up on us. Not yet. [♪] You're a brave man, being seen with me in public. I'm the girl that was engaged to Warren Saget, the guy that's about to tear down the lighthouse. And my mother? She's the judge that gave him permission to do it. Feelin' the heat, huh? I don't mind being seen with you. In fact, I want to be seen with you more often, if that's okay with you. I could even be your bodyguard. So what do you say? You wanna hang out again? I don't know, Seth. I just got out of a relationship. I don't think I should be rushing into anything. You don't think you should be, or you don't want to be? It's okay. No rush. We can take it as slow as you want. I'm a patient man. No, you're not. You're right, I'm not. But I can pretend to be. Watch this. I won't even try to kiss you right now. [Laughs] Wow. Such patience. See? I'm impressed. You should be. Well, if you change your mind... you know where to find me. I thought I'd find you here. Did you get my messages? Yes. That's why I'm out here. The plants don't argue with me. I know you're in a tough position on this. Everyone's giving you a hard time, because they're emotionally attached to the lighthouse. It's always been there, so it's a piece of home. It's my home, too. I feel the same way as everyone else, but I have to uphold the law. That's my job. You should understand that. I do. It's just... [sighs] you know, your father proposed to me at the lighthouse. We used to sneak in past the keeper, climb up on the catwalk. We'd spend hours watching the light sweep across the water. Then, one night, your dad takes me up, gives me a ring, and proposes to me looking over the water. I just wanted you to understand why I felt so strongly about it. [Dejected sigh] Ohh... Delilah, on radio :  Songs like this touch the heart, and that's the beauty of a great song. You're listening to Delilah. [♪] A proposal on the catwalk of the lighthouse? How cool is that? Pretty cool. Dan proposed to me at an A & W. [Snickering] Ohh... Look at that. Your dad was great. How do you think he would've ruled on the lighthouse? He would've done exactly what you did. He stuck with the law. But then he would've remembered he's not just a lawyer, he's a man with great humanity and drive. Someone who would do absolutely everything in his power to take what was wrong and make it right again. What's going on here? We're building a spaceship. You didn't tell me you were gonna paint the dining room. I didn't think I was required to do so. How long is it gonna be messed up like this? You know, you did not have to move back in here with me. Your sister has a beautiful home in Olympia, very nice spare room. But then you wouldn't get to see my pretty face every day. Ahh! How would I survive? You know, uh... you're welcome to help, by the way. [Chuckles] You're cute. See ya! You would hate it if she moved away. Yeah, well, don't you dare tell her that. [Phone rings] Hello? Yeah. Oh, hi! Yes, as a matter of fact, she is. Hang on a sec. Jack Griffith. [Stifles her laugh] Hey, Jack. How did you know I was here? Jack :  I tried you at your home and the office. Sheriff said to try you at Grace's. Something the matter? I need you to go out to the road that leads to the lighthouse. I don't know its name. Lighthouse Road? Right. That would make sense. Why, what's the matter? I mean, what's happening? Well, Warren Saget's demolition crew are on their way to begin work, but I have information that a group of people are about to conduct a demonstration to block their way. Well, why call me? Trust me, you need to get out there as well. [All chatting, indistinct] Here they come! [Overlapping chatter] [Heavy rumbling] [Brakes squealing] [Driver blaring on horn] What is going on here? What's going on, Warren, is a peaceful demonstration of civil disobedience. No. You have to move. All of you. Let's go. Let's go! You've left us no options. This is all we can do. Make peace, not war, man! Right! Wha... oh! Good. Sheriff, how nice of you to join us. You see, these people are, uh, preventing my equipment from getting to my site. We're willing to be arrested! Everybody, link arms! Okay, link arms! Keep your heads down when they bring in the water cannons! What water cannons? Now, look, folks, there has got to be some way to come to an understanding about this. We're prepared to stay here as long as we have to. You know, Bob, bullying me is not going to change my plans. We're not trying to bully you. We're trying to appeal to you. Then we're prepared... to bully, fight. Right. And run you out of town. Bob, just settle down. No, we're not gonna settle down, man! If people settled down, there wouldn't be any change. The civil rights act of 1964, article 1, section 8, ratifying the 15th amendment never would've been sanctioned! Tell Larry to bring up the van. I think you should... You don't need to arrest anyone. You're not going back on your ruling. I'm not going back on anything. These people are insane. I think I have a solution to this mess. Oh, really? What would that be? I need you to send your demolition crew away. What? No! No way... Just for the day. Meet me in my chambers in an hour and we'll talk. You have nothing left to hold over me, okay? Your daughter broke our engagement off, thanks to you. Meet me in an hour. And if you don't like what I have to say, you can bring back your bulldozers, and I'll make sure that you don't have any problems with these people. And why should I trust you? Because... I may fight to protect my daughter and I may do whatever I need to do to uphold the law, but I never lie. [Chuckles incredulously] Um... Guys, I'm going to, uh... I'm gonna delay demolition for one day, okay? [All cheering] Come back tomorrow. We'll be back tomorrow, too! And every day after that! Yeah! God, I miss the '60s! [All laughing] Your chambers. One hour. Sheriff : All right. Cancel the van. Olivia has been through a lot. I know. So you be good to her. I will. Because if you hurt her... I will kill you. Got it. Just sayin'. Hearing you, loud and clear. Right. [♪] You're not going to try to blackmail me again, are you? Like you did with those pictures, trying to get me to break up with Justine? Not that you needed them or anything, Olivia, since she was planning on breaking up with me anyway. I have an offer for you. Hmph. I contacted Senator Pete Rayman, he's a friend of mine. He was able to call some of his contacts at the State Historical Preservation Office... The time for pursuing that, Olivia, has passed. I know. Just hear me out. They found a philanthropist who's willing to put up 80% of the asking price of the lighthouse property. The aim is to purchase the property from you, and then apply for historical landmark designation. I'm sorry, I'm gonna stop you. Did you say 80%? I'm sure, given enough time, they'll find other donors willing to put up the rest, but Senator Rayman can only move so f... No more time. Look, Olivia, you said meet you here in one hour. I'm here, and you either have a solution for me right now, or you don't. You will offer me full listing price, or I'm gonna walk out that door, and tear down your precious little lighthouse. Okay? I can. I figured you wouldn't give us the time, so I'm willing to bridge the gap myself. [Chuckles smugly] You're gonna put up the 20%? That's right. I don't know, if you ask me, Olivia, I don't think that's a smart investment. I didn't ask you. Look, I'm doing this to save the lighthouse for the good of the town. So that's my offer. You've been trying to sell this property for two years. Here's your chance. Okay. I accept. Under one condition. Which is? No one can know about it. Not the transfer of property, not the buyers, nobody. It's got to be kept off public record. We can do this through a blind trust, if you like, whatever, but it needs to be kept secret. So it looks like you've had a change of heart. Like I told you before... I do care what these people think about me. So. That being said, we either do this my way, or no deal. Pleasure doing business with you. Get out of my chambers. [Overlapping chatter] Hey, you. Hey. How you doing? I'm okay. Pretty good turnout. Yeah. Don't think it's gonna help, though. Well, I don't know. We'll see. [Room murmuring] Uh, everybody? If I could... everybody, please? If I could just have your attention for a few seconds, thanks. Um... I just wanted to let you all know that I have decided not to tear down the lighthouse. [One person claps] You've all convinced me that this is what's best for the town. You see, I settled here and I made this place my home, and it's because of good people like you that have made me realize and see that this lighthouse is a symbol... A symbol of hope... a symbol of hope for this town. And I wanted to say thank you. [Applause and cheering] Hoo-hoo-hoo! Look at this guy. You know, a few hours ago, Bob Beldon wanted to punch him in the face. Now he's practically ready to buy him a drink. Olivia had something to do with this. What do you think she said to him? I don't know. You're the reporter. You go find out. I might just do that. Justine : Every time I see you on this boat, you're working. Permission to come aboard? Anytime you want. Thank you. You're welcome. I don't know how you do it, living on a boat. So claustrophobic. Claustrophobic? Only thing keeping me in one place is two ropes tied to the dock. I can just cast away, go anywhere I want. You ever been to Mexico? You know I haven't. Me neither. It'll take us a couple weeks to get there, but it's doable. What do you think? What, go to Mexico? Right now? Si. I think you're crazy. That's what I think. You say it like it's a bad thing. Listen. Uh, about what I was saying earlier, not wanting to rush into things. I don't want you to think that I'm not interested. It's okay. I get it. You need some time. Can't just jump from one relationship straight into another. And you're scared. I mean... [Sighs] being in a relationship with me might be tough. I'm always going off on jobs, for weeks at a time. But, you know... If there was more of a reason to stick around, maybe I wouldn't be in such a rush to leave. [Treva Blomquist's "I Could Get Used To This" begins] ♪ If I had a penny for every kiss... ♪ Admit it... that felt right. ♪ No need to save them all away ♪ 
♪ I'm not expecting rain ♪ 
♪ every day would be a sunny day ♪ 
♪ I could get used to this ♪ 
♪ get used to the way you smile ♪ How did you do it? That meeting you had with Warren Saget, back in your chambers, I'm assuming... You said something to him to make him back down. Then again... Whatever it was, I imagine he made you promise to keep quiet about it. Am I close? [Chuckles] Okay, I get it. I get it. In any event, Cedar Cove has its lighthouse back... its shining beacon of hope. The illuminated compass that guides us all to true north is back in the hands of the people. And sometimes a lighthouse is just a lighthouse. I was trying to impress you by being literary. I know. [Laughing] So... Our dinner date the other night, how do you think that went? I thought it went pretty well. I mean, it was good food, good conversation. Now, you see, I happen to think it was more than that. I met your daughter. We talked about our personal lives. I kissed you. You did not kiss me. Really? I didn't? No! I would remember that. A kiss is a memorable thing. And sometimes... A kiss is just a kiss. We'll see. [Chuckles] "We'll see." [Sighs] "We'll see." [♪]
