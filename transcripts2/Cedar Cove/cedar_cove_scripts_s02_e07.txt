 Previously on Cedar Cove... 
 We think he might have P.T.S.D. 
 Olivia : He'll need a lawyer to argue this case should be moved to vet court. 
 Cecilia : I want to have children. 
 When we're ready. 
 But I'm ready now. 
 I didn't tell you I took the job with Warren because I know you don't like him. 
 Can you just be happy for me? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hey, I didn't hear you come in last night. 
 Oh, yeah, I worked until 9:00, and then Warren insisted I go with him to this meeting. 
 What, at 9:00? 
 Drinks. 
 Some city councilor. 
 That guy didn't know what hit him. 
 By the time Warren bought the second bottle of wine, we already had permits for three more projects. 
 Warren is really good at what he does. 
 Well, I'm making pancakes and sausages. 
 No time. I'm late. 
 Most important meal of the day. 
 Warren says breakfast is for wimps. 
 Gotta go. 
 Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Don't forget tonight, Mets and Phillies. 
 Me, you, that couch, pizza, and Ryan Howard hitting a few out of the park. 
 Sorry, I, uh... 
 Warren's got me on this new project. 
 I'm going to have to work late tonight, too. 
 Did I tell you how much I love working with Warren? 
 A few times. 
 You're up early. 
 I know you're worried about Luke. 
 And I know you can't talk about his case to anyone. 
 Well, I do know he has a good lawyer, and if everything goes well with the new A.D.A., I don't know any reason why his case shouldn't be moved to veterans' court. 
 What does that mean exactly? 
 Well, instead of going to jail, he'll have to adhere to a strict treatment program, and follow everything required of that program. 
 He'll have weekly meetings with myself and his lawyer so that we can keep an eye on his progress, and stop any problems that may arise. 
 You still look worried. 
 Sorry. 
 No. I understand. 
 He means a lot to you. 
 What does that mean? 
 You care about him. 
 Mom, I'm with Seth. 
 I didn't say you weren't. 
 Well, I just think you're thinking there's something more going on with Luke than there is. 
 I'm... I'm not. 
 Okay. 
 See you at the courthouse. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Normally, Mrs. Arnett works here part-time, answering phones, ordering supplies, that kind of thing, but she, uh, she moved away. 
 Are you sure she moved away? 
 Maybe she's just buried here somewhere. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 It's a... it's a bit of a mess. 
 No argument here. 
 Well, thing is, I've never been much for paperwork and office stuff, but if I don't deliver some documents to the county by the end of the week, I am in some serious trouble. 
 Okay, I'm going to find these papers that you need, but then I am going to organize the rest of this stuff. 
 Are you sure you can handle it? 
 I have a master's in library science, which means that I will catalogue, classify, and you... 
 Are buying me dinner, a very expensive dinner. 
 You are so adorable. 
 Thank you. 
 But I'm not just a pretty face. 
 You're right about that darling, you are the whole package. 
 Brains, beauty, you have it all. 
 Oh, just one thing... 
 If I do find Mrs. Arnett, who should I call? 
 [Laughs] 
 If my office phone rings, will you pick it up? 
 I'm expecting a delivery of feed. 
 Whoo! Yee-haw! 
 [Laughing] 
 You know, I really love you. 
 What? 
 I love you. 
 I mean it, Grace. 
 I do. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hey, you. 
 Hey, you. 
 So, Bob told me, that we've got some not-so-local press in from Seattle for Luke's pre-trial. 
 Yeah, they're staying at the thyme and tide. 
 Are you telling me that we have an honest-to-God press frenzy here in Cedar Cove? 
 [Chuckling] Three reporters does not a frenzy make. 
 Well, I'm surprised anybody knows anything about it. 
 Yeah, well, blame the Internet. 
 Apparently, somebody in the crowd recorded the fight with Luke and then posted it online, and it went semi-viral. 
 Do people have nothing better to do than to capture someone at their lowest moment and post it for the world to see? 
 Yeah, these days, I think they call that entertainment. 
 So, um... while I have you, can I ask, has the new A.A.A. told you whether or not the victim will be filing charges, or whether she's willing to move the case to vet court? 
 Jack Griffith, are you interviewing me? 
 You don't want one of these out-of-town hacks scooping me in my own backyard, now, do you? 
 I'll give you an exclusive. 
 Later? 
 Definitely later. 
 Okay. 
 [Chuckling fondly] 
 Hey there. 
 Hey. 
 You ready to go? 
 Yeah. 
 I've sharpened this thing about 900 times, so if we don't go to court soon, there will be nothing left. 
 You sure you're ready? 
 Well, I wasn't, but... 
 Now that you're here. 
 Well, we should get going. 
 Are Bob and Peggy coming with us? 
 No. 
 I also told Ian and Cecilia not to come, because I just, I don't want an audience. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, I get that. 
 I can at least drop you off since I'm here. 
 No, you, I want. 
 Oh. 
 Justine... 
 Yeah? 
 Ooh, boy, this is harder than I thought it would be. 
 What is? 
 Talking to you. 
 We talk all the time. 
 This is different. 
 What's wrong? 
 I can't stop thinking about you. 
 I haven't felt this way about someone... 
 Ever. 
 And I know you feel something, too. 
 I have a boyfriend. 
 But he's not here. 
 That doesn't matter. 
 I'll wait for you in the car. 
 Hey, Ian. 
 I'm so sorry, the bridge had traffic. 
 You're here now. 
 I know we promised Luke we'd stay away, but I don't know if I can. 
 I don't want to talk about Luke. 
 Okay. 
 Tell me why you don't want me to get pregnant. 
 [Sighs] Come on, Cecilia... 
 Tell me. 
 Please... 
 Because... 
 I'm afraid. 
 Afraid of what? 
 Of losing you. 
 I had the most perfectly normal pregnancy. 
 And we almost had the most perfectly normal divorce because of that pregnancy, and we lost the baby. 
 We can't not have children just to make sure our relationship is never tested again. 
 It's going to be tested, but it's going to be... 
 I love you, but no. 
 Not now. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Are you trying to be fashionably late? 
 I'm waiting... 
 [Knock on door] 
 [Clears throat] 
 Judge Lockhart? 
 For the new A.D.A. 
 Hi. 
 Rebecca Jennings, assistant district attorney. 
 Jack Griffith, "chronicle." 
 They have a newspaper here? 
 Yes. 
 We also have indoor plumbing and electricity, too. 
 Sarcasm. 
 Unexpected in a place with one traffic light. 
 All right, then. 
 So, what did you want to see me about? 
 Well, I thought we should meet. 
 We're going to be working together. 
 Your predecessor, Mr. atwood, and I, worked a lot of cases. 
 I was sad to see him retire. 
 Okay, full disclosure. 
 I don't plan to end up like him. 
 Like him? 
 This job is just a stopover for me. 
 I have my resume at a bunch of other firms, big ones. 
 Full disclosure. 
 Be on time, be polite, be professional, or you're going to have a lot more free time to send out that resume. 
 Got it. 
 Good. 
 [Sighs] 
 Jack? 
 Jeri... 
 [Chuckling warmly] 
 Oh... 
 Are you here covering the Luke Bailey pre-trial? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I, um, I live here. 
 No, really? 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 And you? 
 Oh, I just got downsized from Philly, but the Seattle paper picked me up, so... 
 Oh. 
 So, you're in Seattle. 
 Outside of. 
 And you live here. 
 For real. 
 [Chuckling awkwardly] 
 So, you're covering this? 
 Well, yeah. 
 I mean, Seattle has a large military presence, so a story of a soldier attacking someone in a small town, it's kind of big news. 
 Yeah. 
 [Door opens]  
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Oh, um, Jeri Drake, this is Olivia Lockhart. 
 It's very nice to meet you, judge. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Jeri and I, we used to work together, back east. 
 That we did. 
 It's nice to meet a colleague of Jack's. 
 Yes. 
 It is. 
 Excuse me. 
 Okay. 
 "Colleague"? 
 [Sighs nervously] 
 Eight months this house has been on the market. 
 I came close to selling it twice, but, unfortunately, buyers tried to low-ball me. 
 So, what's the plan? 
 Plan is, I'm going to sit on it until the market picks back up. 
 I need you to look after it. 
 You mean like water the grass? 
 [Chuckles] 
 No, I mean, like, move in. 
 Are you serious? 
 I need someone I trust in here, Eric, protecting my investment. 
 You wouldn't even have to pay rent. 
 Can I have some time to think about this? 
 Do you like living with your dad? 
 How does that go over with your friends? 
 Do you even have any friends? 
 What about a girlfriend? 
 And I'm not talking about the one who dumped you and moved to Seattle. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, listen to me. 
 You're a young, successful guy. 
 It's time you started living like one. 
 It's time you manned up, kid. 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 Mr. Goodall, it's my understanding that you've decided to drop the assault charges against Mr. Bailey. 
 Is that correct? 
 My cousin served in Afghanistan. 
 When he got home, he just... 
 He wasn't the same, so... 
 I get it. 
 Thank you, Mr. Goodall. 
 You may sit down. 
 Mr. Smith... 
 In light of my client's service to his country, and the fact that this is his first offense, I'd like to move that the case be dismissed and the charges be expunged from his record. 
 If the assistant district attorney is in agreement. 
 Actually, I'm not in agreement. 
 It's my intention to file a misdemeanor assault charge against Mr. Bailey, and to pursue the maximum sentence of one year in county jail. 
 The victim isn't even filing charges. 
 I have a witness who is willing to testify against Mr. Bailey. 
 Who? 
 The other man saw the whole thing. 
 Give the guy a break. 
 He's suffering from P.T.S.D. 
 I've submitted medical reports and affidavits from two doctors. 
 He is seeking help. 
 That doesn't change the fact that he attacked an unarmed man. 
 He belongs behind bars. 
 Miss Jennings, young men, like Luke, with no criminal history, go off to war, and when they come home, because of the emotional wounds they suffer, as a result of their service, they get into trouble, and then their lives are forever clouded with a criminal record. 
 Judge Lockhart, I strongly believe... please. 
 I'm sure you've heard of veterans' court. 
 If you insist on pressing charges, I would like you to move Luke's case to veterans' court. 
 I agree. 
 I don't believe in vet court. 
 Or drug court. 
 Or any other specialized court. 
 It's a free ride for criminals. 
 [Gasps in disbelief] 
 No one is saying that Luke shouldn't face the consequences of his actions, but I want you to think about this carefully... do you really want to put this obviously troubled man behind bars? 
 That's exactly what I want to do. 
 And what I'm going to do. 
 Vet court is where this case belongs. 
 If she's filing charges, then I have no choice but to set a trial date. 
 But Judge Lockhart... my hands are tied. 
 All right, I'll give you a minute. 
 So, what's going on here? 
 I know it seems bad, but my mom is really good at what she does, so I think the best thing you can do is just have a little faith. 
 Well, the legal stuff will work out or it won't. 
 I'm talking about you. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Of that. Right there. 
 The way you're talking. 
 You're acting strange. 
 No, I'm not. 
 If I said something earlier... 
 I've got to run. 
 I'd like to stay, but I've got to go. 
 Justine... 
 I'll check in later. 
 Hey. 
 Luke! 
 We need to talk. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Harding ranch. 
 No, Cliff isn't here. 
 Is this about the feed delivery? 
 Because if so, I can help... 
 I'm sorry, who-who is this? 
 Hi... 
 Colleague. 
 Yeah, well... 
 So, is Olivia your new colleague? 
 For a while now, yeah. 
 And I'm guessing you don't want her to know about us? 
 I just don't see the point. 
 Oh. 
 Does she know about the drinking? 
 Mm-hmm, yeah, and the not drinking. 
 Really? 
 Sober? 
 Almost a year now. 
 Well, congratulations. 
 You do look good. 
 I will tell her about us eventually, okay? 
 Got it. 
 So, any chance I can get an interview with her about the case? 
 [Sighs] 
 Um, I can try. 
 So... 
 So. 
 I'll see you around? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll see you around. 
 And two. 
 
 
 
 Good morning, Moon. 
 Eric. 
 Two cafe Mochas, no sugar, no whip, extra dry, half skim, half full milk, please. 
 If I just want a black coffee, can I just skip to the front of the line? 
 Haven't you ever heard of "first come first serve?" 
 Have you ever heard of real coffee? 
 Seriously. 
 Half skim, half full milk? 
 Couldn't you just order 2%? 
 Or be a man and drink it black. 
 Okay. 
 Look, um, I'm going through some serious caffeine withdrawal. 
 Please, just this once? 
 So now you're going to be nice? 
 Yeah. 
 How about this? 
 I'll let you cut in front of me if you give me your number. 
 I'll even buy your coffee. 
 Done. 
 One black coffee. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, you owe me a number. 
 Four. 
 [Scoffs] 
 It's a number. 
 Come on, give me a break. 
 Nine. 
 Now you just need to figure out the other five. 
 Good luck. 
 Oh, and, uh, thanks again for the coffee... 
 Eric. 
 You're not going to give me your name? 
 Correct. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Do you know who she is? 
 No, I don't. 
 But I do know who Shelly is. 
 Your girlfriend. 
 The mother of your child. 
 Yeah, we're not exactly together anymore. 
 It's complicated. 
 No, it's not. 
 But it could get that way. 
 [Sighing] 
 Stop that. 
 I can't help it. I want it to be right. 
 Does it really matter which side the water glass is on? 
 Or, for that matter, which one is the water glass? 
 They'll know it's the water glass because it has water in it. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 [Chuckling] 
 Thyme and tide. 
 Hey, Jack. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks for the update. 
 Well? 
 It's not good news. 
 Luke may end up being charged. 
 [Sighs] 
 Wow. 
 So, what do you think? 
 You are truly gifted. 
 Dinner? 
 Well, a deal's a deal. 
 Just let me get changed and showered. 
 Oh, you got a call today. 
 The feed delivery? 
 No, Stephen. 
 Your son. 
 Your son called. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 I'm just going to get cleaned up, and we'll go off to dinner. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, dad. 
 What's all this? 
 I need to talk to you about something. 
 I really like living here, but maybe it's time I found my own place. 
 You want to move out? 
 Yeah. 
 When? 
 Now? 
 Into one of Warren's houses. 
 Warren's? 
 I won't have to pay rent. 
 It's like a bonus for all the overtime I've been working. 
 Hey... 
 It's a good thing. 
 Well, believe it or not, I was once young myself. 
 I get it. 
 I'm happy for you. 
 You know, you have been so great about Warren, about everything with this job. 
 Thank you. 
 All right. 
 Well, you don't have to leave right this minute, so... 
 Well, I mean, I don't have a lot of stuff, and to be honest, I'm kind of excited to have my own place, so I'm just going to keep packing. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 That's, like, the second time he's called. 
 How about you tell me what's going on with you two? 
 Did something happen at the pre-trial? 
 Something happened before the pretrial. 
 He told me that he likes me. 
 Anyone can see that. 
 I thought we were friends. 
 Correction. 
 Anyone who wants to see it, can see it. 
 I love Seth. 
 True, but you can't deny that you like Luke, too. 
 You don't find this situation a tad ironic? 
 You have been trying to get Luke to realize that he can't run from his emotions, and that's exactly what you're doing. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 Damn it. 
 I need something stronger than tea. 
 Wine? 
 Right. 
 You're trying to get pregnant. 
 Have you talked to Ian? 
 Yes. 
 And? 
 He doesn't want to have a baby right now. 
 What are you going to do? 
 I did it. 
 I stopped taking birth control. 
 You didn't. 
 You have got to be honest with Ian. 
 You have got to be honest with Luke. 
 No fair. 
 I'm desperate. 
 Clearly. 
 [Sniffs] 
 [Bicycle bell rings] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Aw... 
 Bob... 
 [Sniffing] 
 [Chuckles fondly] 
 Wow. 
 [Bell rings] 
 Good afternoon. 
 Well, now, that's a great car. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 That you have a nice car. 
 Which means, what? 
 How can I afford a car like this? 
 That I like your car. 
 My father had one of these, a convertible. 
 Every once in a while, he'd let me drive it. 
 Ah, I loved that car. 
 Where is this going? 
 Where's what going? 
 All of this car talk. 
 When two people talk and share stories and anecdotes, it's commonly known as "a conversation." 
 Oh. 
 Hey. 
 I think we got off on the wrong foot this morning. 
 I know you say you're not going to be in town for very long, we still have to work together for the greater good. 
 I'm just here to do my job. 
 But it's not that simple. 
 Your reputation in law is going to be built on two things, the way you treat your colleagues and the decisions you make in the courtroom. 
 You have to decide what kind of lawyer you want to be. 
 The kind of lawyer that wins a high-profile case, and gets out of this town for good. 
 Luke Bailey is going to prison, where he belongs. 
 End of story. 
 Cliff... 
 Yeah? 
 Are we going to talk about your son? 
 Who I just found out about today. 
 I didn't think he'd call on that line. 
 Well, he did, so now I know. 
 Yeah. 
 Really? 
 Stephen is my ex-wife's grown son from her first marriage. 
 I basically raised him. 
 When my wife cheated on me and left, Stephen kind of got lost in the mix, so I look out for him. 
 Well, why didn't you just tell me about him? 
 [Sighs heavily] 
 Whatever Stephen knows, my ex knows, she's his mother. 
 Yeah? 
 She's not well, my ex, and, frankly, I don't know what she'd do if she found out about you. 
 Well, she's the one who left you. 
 I didn't want to get you dragged into something with her, and I figured the easiest way to keep you out of this was to keep you out of this. 
 Whoa. 
 You seem upset. 
 Are you angry because I answered the phone? 
 You're the one who told me to... 
 Grace, honestly, you don't know why I'm upset? 
 I don't say "I love you" to many people. 
 I've got some chores to do. 
 Let's have dinner another night. 
 [Sighs] 
 Judge Lockhart? 
 Yes. 
 Do you have a minute? 
 Sorry, not for press. 
 Uh, I'm not here for press. 
 What are you, then? 
 A concerned stranger. 
 Concerned? About what? 
 Jack Griffith. 
 We were more than colleagues. 
 We were married. 
 It was a spur of the moment thing... we were in Vegas, and... 
 You know, everything about our relationship was "spur of the moment." 
 I met Jack my first day of work back in Philly, at the paper. 
 He was a friend, and a mentor... then more. 
 I mean, his drinking was out of hand at home, but totally in control at work. 
 He was the most functional alcoholic I have ever met. 
 And he was... well, I'm sure he still is... a truly gifted writer. 
 But a very troubled man. 
 I'm sure Jack will tell me all of this someday. 
 I wouldn't be so sure. 
 Excuse me? 
 Well, alcoholism, addiction, it's all based on lies and deception. 
 I mean, sure, he's sober now, but... why are you telling me this? 
 Why are you here? 
 Because I wish someone had been there to warn me. 
 Consider yourself warned. 
 [Gasping] 
 Thanks for letting me hide out with you. 
 If you just want to tell Luke you aren't interested, why do you need to hide out? 
 What's really going on? 
 I can't deny that I'm attracted to him. 
 Which I hate myself for. 
 Okay... 
 So your plan is to stay hidden... 
 Forever? 
 I'm not the only one of us that's hiding out. 
 I'm going to talk to Ian about... 
 Stopping birth control. 
 Before or after you accidentally get pregnant? 
 I'm hoping before. 
 This isn't a game. 
 You'd better make it before. 
 I've tried talking. 
 Lying to him isn't going to work either. 
 You're right. 
 So are you.

 I got your message. 
 What am I doing here in Cooperton? 
 Opening your mind. 
 Anthony. 
 Judge Lockhart. 
 And miss Jennings. 
 They're waiting for us inside. 
 I called a friend of mine who's involved in veterans' court today is graduation day for the vets who have successfully finished the program. 
 Shall we? 
 So you called my boss. 
 You must be enjoying this. 
 I'm not hating it. 
 [Humming] 
 [Cell phone message chimes] 
 Come in. 
 I will, because, you see, I own it. 
 Oh, this is just sad. 
 It's nice to see you're eating well. 
 Excuse me? 
 Ooh... 
 Why are you here? 
 Because you said I could live here. 
 Yes. 
 The opportune word being "live." 
 Did I do something wrong? 
 Yes, you did. 
 Wait, I did? 
 [Sighs] 
 Listen, Eric, you'll be married one day soon enough, okay, and then you can say goodbye to your freedom. 
 But for right now, you don't have to answer to anybody, okay? 
 You're finally your own man here. 
 You're making your own money, you're living in your own house. 
 It's time you start enjoying it while it lasts. 
 Right? 
 Translation, walk away from that microwave, and get out there and start living like a guy in his 20s. 
 Now, I realize it's not easy in Cedar Cove, trust me, but something tells me you're up for the challenge. 
 Mm. 
 Hmm. 
 Oh, that's an order, not a suggestion. 
 Okay. 
 And you can thank me later. 
 Fantastic. 
 Well, I like what I saw. 
 Veteran's court doesn't hand down prison sentences, instead it enable vets to start over, which, in the end, helps all of us, don't you think? 
 I do. 
 Excuse me, ladies. 
 It's a simple ceremony, but it's really quite moving. 
 Look... 
 Stop interfering with my job. 
 Okay? 
 I'm not going to change my mind. 
 My boss might be your friend, but I'm the one who decides how this case ends up. 
 I'm the A.D.A. and you can't just... what you need to do right now is be quiet and listen. 
 I have tried everything with you, kindness, empathy, facts, and, clearly, the only thing left to do is to smack you upside the head. 
 [Sighing] Young lady, with great power comes great responsibility. 
 You could probably convict Luke of assault, but you have to ask yourself if doing so serves any other purpose other than feathering your own nest. 
 Hint, the answer is no. 
 This is not a game. This is real life, and your decision will affect a real person. 
 I'll see you in court. 
 Fine. 
 Vet court it is. 
 You made the right choice. 
 No. 
 You outplayed me. 
 I'll see you around, Judge Lockhart. 
 Round two should be fun, don't you think? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hi. 
 Look, when you told me you loved me, it just really took me by surprise. 
 I haven't said those words to another man other than my ex-husband, and I know you wanted me to say it back to you, but I just wasn't ready. 
 Then your son called, and that was an easy distraction, because then it gave me the time not to focus on those three little words. 
 It's okay, Grace, you'll say it when you're ready. 
 Cliff... 
 I love you. 
 Well, just so we're clear, I said it first. 
 [Laughs] Yes, you did. 
 But Cliff, listen. 
 Yeah. 
 I do not want you to take this the wrong way. 
 Okay. 
 I've decided I'm not going to move out to your cabin. 
 But I thought you had to sell your house. 
 I don't want to. 
 But you can't afford it. 
 Well, I'll find a way. 
 It's my home. 
 It's where I belong. 
 Okay. 
 Really? 
 Thank you for being you. 
 My pleasure, ma'am. 
 Ta-dah! 
 What's all this? 
 A thank you. 
 For? 
 They're lovely, and you are so thoughtful. 
 I am? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All my favorites, just breathtaking. 
 I hope what I'm about to say doesn't jeopardize me having one of these cookies, but I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Oh... 
 You sent me flowers. 
 I did? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 On the porch? 
 Mm-mm, that wasn't me. 
 Well then, who did? 
 Looks like you've got a secret admirer. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Come on... 
 Bourbon, straight up. 
 That's a serious drink. 
 I have had a seriously bad day. 
 You want to talk about it? 
 Let's just say this town and the people in it. 
 I don't think I belong here. 
 [Chuckles ruefully] 
 You know, I didn't plan on living here either. 
 It just sort of happened. 
 But maybe where you end up is where we're supposed to be. 
 So, where are you from? 
 Topeka, Kansas. 
 Kansas. 
 You don't seem like you're from Kansas. 
 Born and raised. 
 I swore I'd never end up in a small town again, and look where I am. 
 So, do you always drink alone? 
 No. 
 No, I guess I'm just trying to avoid my big, empty house. 
 You've got one up on me. 
 I have a tiny, empty apartment. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm Rebecca, by the way. 
 Eric. 
 But I told you. 
 So... 
 You want to get out of here? 
 You Kansas girls sure are friendly. 
 You have no idea. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I've been looking all over for you. 
 Well, here I am. 
 My lawyer called. 
 The A.D.A. is going to move my case to vet court. 
 No jail time. 
 I'm glad it all worked out for you. 
 I'm sorry about yesterday. 
 What part? 
 Making you feel uncomfortable. 
 We can't be together. 
 I think we can. 
 You're wrong. 
 So, have you heard from Eric? 
 No. He's moved out and forgotten all about me. 
 Well, don't you worry. 
 He'll be by for a visit, if it's only to wash his clothes and clean out the refrigerator. 
 [Laughing] 
 I had a visitor today. 
 Yeah? 
 Your friend, Jeri, came by to see me. 
 She's not a big fan of yours. 
 She is from another time in my life. 
 [Sighs] 
 You know I love you. 
 That I do. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Right back. 
 Hey. 
 Thank you. 
 What have you got there? 
 Let's see. 
 Who would send you that? 
 "From Jeri..." 
 "Your friend and colleague."
