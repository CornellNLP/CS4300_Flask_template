 Previously on  Cedar Cove... 
 You're buying a restaurant? 
 Seth :  It's gonna keep me here in Cedar Cove, with you. 
 I want to sign up for riding lessons. 
 I'll see you at the ranch, then. 
 Jack :  The last time the Feds were in town, they were asking about Warren Saget. 
 I found some photos in Shelly's room. 
 That's Eric, right? Jack's son? 
 Hi. 
 You said you had something to tell me that was urgent? 
 Yeah. Sit down. 
 You know the young girl that's working at Moon's? 
 Shelly? 
 The girl with the great voice? 
 Yes. She's not here by accident. 
 She's here to see you. 
 Me? 
 Peggy found some photos of Shelly and Eric in her room. 
 My Eric? 
 Jack... 
 Eric's gonna have a baby. 
 Eric can't have a baby. He is a baby. 
 He's your baby, but he is all grown up. 
 [Sighs] 
 I think she came here looking for Eric. 
 Ohh... 
 [Heavy sigh] 
 She probably thinks that I can force Eric to do the right thing. 
 Olivia... 
 I have no idea where Eric is. 
 When I was in Philadelphia, I talked to his mother. 
 She doesn't know where he is. 
 I left word for him with anybody that I could think of. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 He's probably really scared. 
 This means that when he was here, he was reaching out to me about this, and all I did is I berated him about getting a job, about being a grown-up, I didn't... 
 Don't beat yourself up. 
 You had no idea what he was going through. 
 He will find his way back here. 
 I talked to Shelly. 
 You have to know... 
 She's thinking about giving the baby up for adoption. 
 Did she tell you why? 
 I don't think she wants to, I just think she's overwhelmed with the idea of the responsibility and having to do this all by herself. 
 I need to talk to her. 
 Jack... 
 I love you, Jack Griffith. 
 [♪] 
 I love you, Olivia Lockhart. 
 Oh. 
 [♪] 
 Justine : I don't understand. Why are you here? 
 Agent : I just want to ask you a few questions about Warren Saget. 
 Warren? What about him? 
 Troy, what's going on? 
 It's not about you, Justine. 
 He just needs some information about Warren, that's all. 
 Yeah, if you don't want to talk to me, you do not have to, you're not under arrest. 
 Arrest? Why would I be under arrest? 
 How much do you know about Warren's business? 
 He's in real estate. He buys and sells properties. 
 He builds homes and office buildings. 
 Did he ever introduce you to any of his business partners? 
 Warren doesn't have partners. 
 He doesn't trust anyone. 
 He needs to have full control over every aspect of his life. 
 Oh, he has partners. 
 They give him lots of money to invest in small towns like this, undeclared money that can't be traced back to them, doesn't show up in any books anywhere. 
 Money laundering? 
 That's part of it. 
 Okay. 
 He didn't tell me about his business, and I didn't ask. 
 Maybe you overheard some conversations, you know, uh, saw something? 
 I don't know what he did or what you think he did, but he never stole from me, he never hurt me... 
 I almost married him. 
 Well, that wasn't gonna happen, was it? 
 What do you mean? 
 Who's that? 
 That's Warren Saget's wife.

 Cedar Cove 01x13 
Homecoming 
Originally Aired October 12, 2013 
 Hey, Eric, it's me, dad. 
 Uh, please call me when you get this, okay? 
 I just want you to know that I'm here for you, and I'll help you any way that I can. 
 [Sighs] 
 Shelly's here. 
 She's staying at the Thyme And Tide, and, uh... 
 It's time for you to step up, son. 
 It's time for you to take responsibility. 
 It's not just about you anymore. 
 I'm here for you, but you need to call me. 
 I love you, son. Bye. 
 Seth : Warren's married? 
 Justine : That's not all. 
 The agent wouldn't tell me everything, but from what he did say... 
 Warren's using the money from the sale of properties in New York and Chicago, and reinvesting it in small towns, where the titles can't be traced, and he doesn't pay capital gain taxes. 
 He owns a dozen different properties in town under a dozen different corporate names. 
 He owned a huge housing complex in New York that suspiciously burned down after he sold it, but he collected the insurance. 
 So he's not just a bad guy, he's a dangerous guy. 
 You know how he saved the lighthouse as a gift to the town? 
 Yeah. 
 It's a lie. 
 My mom got a group of philanthropists to buy 80%, and she put up the last 20% with her own money. 
 The only reason that Warren agreed was if she promised not to tell anyone, so that he would look like a hero. 
 That agent told you that? 
 Yeah. 
 Troy didn't even know. 
 Now, what are we supposed to do in the meantime? 
 He wants us to pretend like we don't know anything. 
 He didn't even want me to tell you, but I told him that I love you, and we're together, and that's it. 
 Thanks. 
 How did you guys find out that it was Eric's baby? 
 It's a small town. 
 Shelly, do you know where he is? 
 No. I have no idea. 
 I thought he was here with you. 
 Well, he was for a little while. 
 He always talked about coming here someday. 
 He really wanted a relationship with you. 
 We were working on it. 
 Then he left, right? That's what he does. 
 When he's scared or he's confronted, he just bolts. 
 Did he know about the baby? 
 We'd just had the first ultrasounds. 
 I think actually seeing the baby made it real. 
 He got scared. 
 He didn't think he'd be a good dad. 
 He didn't feel like he had anything to offer a baby. 
 [Sighs] 
 He told me we should give it up for adoption, and I got really mad, and I said "if that's the way you feel, then you should leave, and I'll raise her by myself," and he left the next day. 
 After he'd been gone a while, though, I realized Eric was right. 
 We are too young. We have nothing to offer a baby. 
 You know, the baby deserves to have parents that can provide for her. 
 Listen, Shelly, I just want you to know that you're not alone in this. 
 I'm going to find an amazing family that can raise her and give her the life that she deserves. 
 I hope you'll still help me with the legal side of it. 
 I'll do what I can. 
 Thank you so much for... for talking to me and-and offering to help, but I've made my decision, and... [Takes a slow breath] Now I... I need to get back to work. 
 [Sighs heavily] 
 We have to find Eric. 
 Don't worry, we will. 
 He and Shelly, they need to talk about this, about what's best for the baby. 
 You're right. 
 She doesn't want to do it alone. 
 No. 
 Bob : Jack and Olivia. 
 You know, I kind of like the sound of that. 
 "Jack and Olivia." "Olivia and Jack." 
 [All laughing] 
 Does this mean I get my old fishing buddy back? 
 You know, why do I get the feeling you knew I'd be back to stay even before I did? 
 Because I have something you don't... 
 Perspective. 
 Ahh. 
 Did you get a chance to speak to Shelly? 
 Yeah, we did, we just saw her. 
 She's such a sweet girl. 
 Good. 
 More lights? 
 I drove by your house. 
 You already have enough to light up the city. 
 Oh, Olivia. 
 You can never have too many lights. 
 You know, I am committed to making our city the most beautiful, spectacular... 
 Save it. 
 Great... 
 I'm not on the judging committee this year. 
 Never mind. 
 [All laughing] 
 See you, Bob. 
 Bye. 
 [♪] 
 I love this. 
 You're becoming a real cowgirl. 
 I know. 
 Come on, I'll race you. 
 You're on! 
 [♪♪] 
 Hi-yah! 
 [Whinnying] 
 Yee-haw! 
 Was that amazing or what? 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 Either I'm a great teacher or you're a natural. 
 Honey, you are a fabulous teacher, and I'm having the time of my life. 
 I'm glad. 
 So what I'm thinking is, I should make you dinner as a thank-you gift. 
 Grace, I'm, uh... 
 Okay, I'm not gonna push it. Just saying. 
 I'm give you as much time as you need to think about it. 
 [Gate creaks] 
 So? 
 Did you think about it? 
 See, I'm thinking dinner, my place, Friday. 
 I'd like that very much. 
 Great. I will see you at 7:00. 
 [♪] 
 This is exciting! 
 I'm friends with the owners of the hot new restaurant in town. 
 I hope you're right. 
 Of course I'm right. 
 I'm really happy for you and Seth. 
 Thank you. You know, I was thinking we could display the work of new artists in the restaurant to help promote the gallery. 
 That would be amazing. 
 Still no luck with John? 
 No. I've been searching everywhere in Seattle, but I'm not giving up. 
 I have a few more leads I'm going to check out. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Eric? 
 Who's Eric? 
 Oh, hey, Mike. 
 Sorry I missed your call earlier. 
 What's up, man? When are you coming back? 
 [Sighing] Uh... I'm not. 
 I've decided to stay. 
 Don't play with me, man. 
 I wouldn't joke about something like this. 
 Listen, Mike, I, uh... I'm just in a different place in my life right now. Are you kidding me? Do you know what I had to do to get people to even think about hiring you again? I know. I appreciate that. I stuck my neck out for you, man! I know. I'm sorry. Look, you walk away from this, that's it. No one in this town's gonna touch you. I realize that. And for what, huh? A woman? Yes, Mike. For a woman. So pack her up and bring her home with you. Well, you see, that's just the thing. She and I, we already are home. Let me ask you a question. Why would you leave Philadelphia to live in a town where nothing ever happens, huh? Well, um... I'm gonna have to get back to you on that one. Yeah. You do that. [Sighs] [♪] Jack :  What is it about small-town life that draws people in and keeps them there? Big-city life is more exciting. More happens every day, and it happens at a faster speed with greater fanfare and more colors. There's less time for worry and contemplation. Neighbors mind their own business and connecting happens in cyberspace. But that isn't what happens in a small town. [Register error beeping] [Beep] You okay? Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. This... this drawer won't open. [Beeping] [Drawer clacks and opens] I used to work here. I'm Justine. I'm Shelly. Welcome. I think you'll really like it here. I already do. Moon's amazing. He is. What can I get you? Vanilla latte. On the house. Coming right up. Thank you. So, you finally found someone to replace me? Aw, there's no one can replace you. You and Shelly each present your own unique aura. Well, in her case, two auras. But I understand congratulations are in order. You and Seth opening a restaurant? I promise, we're not gonna steal any of your business. No, I just, uh, just wanted to give you something. It's beautiful. It's "Fu." Fu? Enunciating : "Fu." Chinese symbol for good fortune. You hang onto that, and you're good to go. Thank you, Moon. Aw. [Chuckles] [Kissing] Peggy : Oh! Be careful up there! I will. Well, if it isn't the head judge of the Christmas decorating committee. Charlotte : Just thought I'd stop by and see how it's coming along. The pyramids didn't take this long to build. He's an artist. These things take time. Michelangelo took four years to paint the sistine chapel. [Charlotte chuckles] It's looking really nice, Bob. It's nowhere near finished. Okay, good. I was just over at Edna Stanton's house. Her display is spectacular this year. [Bulbs rattling] You're creating a monster here. All in good fun. "Spectacular," huh? Hah! [Siren wailing in the distance] She put in all of her savings? Everything she's ever squirreled away, from babysitting to Moon's to the gallery. Wow. That's pretty... Risky. I know. Well, I was gonna say bold. You're right. And she's very happy, and now Seth doesn't have to go away on those long trips. Well, I think it's great. People in love, they need to be together. Well, I agree. Mm. Oh. I, um... Bought you something. A little early Christmas present. [Laughs] Ohh! I love it. It's a little bit of you... The scales of justice, and a little of us, the unsinkable canoe. Hopefully we can add to it over time. That's the most thoughtful present anyone's ever given me. [♪] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [♪] Do you think I'm a bad person for giving up my baby? Quite the contrary, actually. I think you're doing what good mothers do. You're doing what you think is best for your child. I was adopted. You were? Yep. So did you hate your mom for giving you up? No. Not really. I mean, I always wondered who she was. When I was a youngster, I used fantasize about her coming back to get me one day. As I got older, I realized that, well, I just couldn't imagine a better life or finer parents than the ones I already had. So you never went to find her? Well, I remember hearing once that, uh, we actually choose our parents before we're born. I believe that. So you chose someone who didn't keep you? Well, I was, you know, up there... In the clouds, and, uh, I pointed at my birth mother and I said, "I want that woman to be my mother." But then I pointed to my mom, and I said, "I want her to raise me." I made that choice, and I knew what I was doing. [♪] Bob! There's someone in Shelly's room! What? There's somebody in there. Are you sure? Yes. Well, it's Shelly. No. She left an hour ago. Be careful. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Jack. Hey, Bob. Thank you. [Jack sighs] Hey. Hey. You know, you didn't need to sneak around like that. You could've just knocked on the front door, or better yet, you could've come to my house. I just want to talk to her alone. I don't need you judging me. Oh. [Sighs] Eric, I'm not judging you. I'm not. I just want to help you, son. I want to help both of you be responsible parents. I am being responsible. I told her we should put the baby up for adoption, and she kicked me out. She's scared. That's all. Try to see this from her perspective. Imagine how alone she must feel right now. Where is she? Well, she got a job at Moon's. She's singing there as well. She has the most amazing voice. I know. Eric! Hi. Hi. 
 
 [♪] [Door creaks open] Hey. Wow! You've done a lot of work, Justine. This place looks nice. Yeah, um, we've got a lot of plans for the place. So when's the big grand opening? In the new year. Hoping for February. Fantastic. I'll make sure to book my reservation early. So where's Seth? He'll be back any minute. He does that a lot, doesn't he? He just disappears? I'm kidding! It's not funny. Justine, look, I wish you guys the of best luck with the place. I do. I hope it's a huge success. Okay? I'm not lying about that, either. I hate lies. As a matter of fact, I hate liars, don't you? Yeah. I think in the end, liars get what they deserve. Looks great. [Door creaks shut] Part of me realized you were right, but still I couldn't imagine giving up our baby. I know. I got a good job in Seattle. It's decent money, so I can pay for your rent, and the doctor visits, and everything. I really like your dad. He's a lot like you. I'm nothing like him. He's been really nice to me, and his friend, Olivia, is helping with the adoption. That's good. How do you feel? [Laughing] Pretty good. I'm not sick in the mornings anymore. Can I...? Yeah. I'm sorry I've been out of touch. I just figured that's the way you wanted it. I really missed you. I missed you too. FBI agent : He threatened you? Justine : I don't know. He was talking about how much he hates liars, but it's more the way he looked at me when he said it. Right. He may just be fishing. He knows I'm around, and I haven't tried to hide it. I still need him to sweat a bit, though. Do you think you could talk to him again? Maybe he'll slip up, give you some information. Sure. Do you think she's in any danger? Oh, he's not that kind of dangerous, and he knows I'm watching him. [♪] [Knocking at door] [♪] Hi! Come on in. It's cold out there. Yeah. You look beautiful. Really? Thank you. [Paper rustles] I brought those for you. Aww. Oh, these are beautiful. Thank you. I feel like maybe I should go home and change. You look stunning. Oh, no, no, no, no! This old thing? That I bought today after trying on 20 other dresses? You bought a dress for tonight? I did, and I got something else to tell you. I even had my hair done. Full disclosure. Whole truth, nothing but. Are you having a party? [Laughs] No. It's just you and me. I couldn't decide what to make, so I just thought I'd make everything I could think of. [Laughs] Well, it's very fancy. I'll be right back. Quietly : Wow. [Exhales] Okay. So, you grab those wine glasses... And follow me. All right. Better? Better. Groans quietly : Oh... You'll get used to it. What? You're sore from sitting on that horse. You'll get used to it. Well, I hope so, because I slept with an ice pack on my butt after the first two lessons. Oh, too much full disclosure? [Laughing] No. Cheers! [Clink] What are you doing? Helping. Do you know that in 26 years of marriage, I don't remember my husband ever doing that once. Well, then, I'm sorry to say, but your husband was an idiot. Back up. I'm sorry, but it's the truth. I said back up. One more step. Okay. Look at that. Mistletoe. ♪ Oh, night ♪ 
♪ oh, night divine ♪ 
♪ oh, night ♪ 
♪ divine ♪ 
♪ oh, night ♪ 
♪ oh, night divine ♪ [applauding] [Chuckling] Whoa. Your voice. You remind me of Sandy Denny. Sorry, who? Only one of the greatest folk singers that ever lived. I don't know her. Aw, come on! Sandy Denny? Fairport convention? Uh... [stammers] The Strawbs? Uh... Fotheringay? And... She was the only guest singer that Led Zeppelin ever recorded with! [Pained gasp] [Continues gasping] Whoa, whoa... Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I think I'm just cramping. [Cries out in pain] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Somebody call 911! [Shelly gasping] Breathe. Breathe. Jack :  Small towns are like families. The people come together when they need each other. They walk in when everyone else is walking out. Like a family, they fight and yell and argue, but at the end of the day, living in a small town means being connected to something bigger than just yourself. [Jack sighs] Any change? No. She's gonna be okay. I hope you're right. Can I get you anything else? No. Okay. Hey, dad? Yeah? What am I supposed to do? I got nothing to offer her. Oh, yes, you do. You have everything that she needs right now. You're here and you care. You... are gonna make a great dad. I don't know how to be a dad. I have no idea what to do. You're doing it now. You're showing up. That's the first step. And after that... [Exhales deeply] You just take it one step at a time. I hope you're right. I believe in you. And I know, you and I, we have some gaps to fill in, and... Some time to make up for, but we'll get there. We'll see. [♪] Warren. Hey. What're you... What are you doing here? What's going on with you? I'm not following. What're you talking about? The FBI came to see me today. Oh. Wow, the FBI. That's interesting. What'd they have to tell you? Not much. He just asked me a lot of questions about you, and about your business, who you talk to, and where you go. Justine, he's fishing. That's all. Look, when you own as many properties as I do, the government feels the need to keeps tabs on you. They want to grab every last penny they can out of you. So it's nothing? No, of course not. Guy's been following me around for days. They're just trying to intimidate me. Obviously I've done nothing illegal, so they can't charge me with anything, right? So when they wear themselves out, they'll go home. It's fine. You know... He asked me about your partners. I told him you don't have any. That's true, right? Yeah. That guy that you used to talk to all the time... Sam something, from New York? Sam? He's harmless, trust me. He's my broker. Okay. Because he asked me if you ever used my phone to make calls, and I told him that you did. So he asked if he could see my bill, and I didn't want to do anything that would hurt you. And I appreciate that. Thank you. Well, I'll... see you. Have a good night, okay? [Phone beeps] [♪♪] Peggy! [Door opens] Peg! Come on out here. You gotta see this. Coming! Come on and stand down here beside me for the full effect. Wait! Do I need special glasses so I don't burn my retinas? Are you excited to see this or not? [Laughing] Yes. Here? Let 'er rip. [♪♪] [Gasps quietly] Oh... Bob. It's stunning. [Chuckles] Yeah. It's just magical! Yeah. Take that, Edna Stanton. Sadly : Oh. What? Charlotte was telling me about Edna today, how much this contest means to her. She lives alone, no family. Nothing to look forward to except this. It's kind of sad. Don't you have some more baking to do? Oh, yes, I do. Good job. [♪♪] Justine : He's too smart to say anything to me. He would never say anything to incriminate himself, but at least I rattled him a little, got him worried. I did some research online today. What'd you find out? If the FBI arrests Warren, they're going to seize all his bank accounts and all of his properties, and they could stay frozen indefinitely, which means the restaurant will be closed and boarded up until they have something to charge him with. So we could lose everything? Exactly. [Distant sirens wailing] John! Maryellen, what are you doing here? You look... tired. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. You been following me? No. I was here on business and I saw a picture hanging in a gallery. It's the one you took of me. Look... I know I pushed you too far. What happened between you and your parents is your business. I'll never mention them again, but, John... [sighs] You can't keep running away. I'm not running away. I'm just trying to live my life. Is this the life you want to live? A life where no one ever gets close enough to know you? A life where you run away from anyone who tries? I'm so sick of people judging me when they find out where I've been. I'm so tired of proving to people that I'm not a bad guy. I never judged you! I never asked you to prove anything. All I did was care about you. You don't understand. You're right, I don't understand. I don't understand why you're punishing yourself for the mistakes your parents made. I'm not punishing myself, I'm protecting myself. From what? From me? I don't want to hurt you. I care about you. You don't know me. You try to hide who you are, but I still see you. You're a good man. You're gentle and kind and talented. You deserve more. You deserve more! You deserve to be happy. You need to stop running. John... Please, Maryellen, just leave me alone. You need to forgive your family and take your life back! It's not about my family! You think you know everything that's going on with me, Maryellen, but you don't, you don't know anything. You don't have a clue. I want to. I care about you, Maryellen. I care about you so much that I want to keep you safe. The only way I can do that... is if I keep you out of my life. [♪♪] Peggy : Just got the call! Charlotte and the other judges have left Edna's. They should be here any minute. Jack :  Small towns don't have museums and symphonies. The night life ends before midnight, and five-star restaurants are nowhere to be found, but what you will find are open doors and open hearts. What are you doing? Giving Edna Stanton her one shining moment. [♪] Jack :  People look out for one another, and community... well, community matters most of all. I can't believe you didn't tell me any of this. The agent told me not to. I can't believe that you didn't tell me about the lighthouse. I had to promise Warren I wouldn't. I knew he was a con artist. I had no idea he was a criminal. I should have! He has shifty eyes. Well, it sounds like this agent is close to arresting him. How's Shelly doing? I know that Moon was really worried about her. Better! I just talked to Eric an hour ago... [Flames roaring] [♪♪] [Explosion] [Rubble clatters] Well... Nothing definitive, but the arson investigator says it's looking like the fire was set deliberately. I knew there was no way Warren would let us open this place. We never should've done business with him. Troy : Now, hold on, you two! Let the investigators do their job. Don't go speculating. I'm not speculating! I know exactly who did this, and so do you. Warren Saget. If that's true, then let the law handle it. I don't want you doing anything that's gonna get you into trouble, you understand me? [Sighs] Warren! Hey, guys. Merry Christmas. How could you do this? Do what? You started that fire. Guys, what fire? You burned down our restaurant! Okay, what? Don't act like you don't know! Come on, Justine, please, wait a second. This makes no sense. Guys, I had nothing to do with this. Don't you ever get tired of lying? I didn't burn down your restaurant! Please! Then who did? Seth, I have no idea. Obviously, I'm being framed. Let's go. Justine! It's Christmas! Why would I even think about doing something like that? [Stammers] Warren Saget? You are under arrest. Look, I had nothing to do with this. This is ridiculous. I know, and I don't care. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used... I understand, okay? Oh, you know the drill. Yes. Hands down, worst Christmas ever. We're going to get through this, Seth. One way or another, we're gonna open this restaurant. [Equipment humming] [Saws whirring, hammers pounding] They're here! Everyone : Hey! [All cheering] Merry Christmas! What are you guys all doing here? Well, we made a few calls, and Jack put a special edition of  The Chronicle  online. Merry Christmas, sweetheart! Thank you, Grandma. Hey, don't worry, you two, we're gonna this place back in shape in no time. Right, Bob? Piece of cake. Oh! Speaking of cake, I managed to save some from my cookie monster over there. Help yourself. [Everyone laughing] I can't believe you guys are all doing this. Oh, honey, it's Cedar Cove. When someone's in trouble, we pitch in. Rally the troops. [Revs his drill] Yeah, but it's Christmas day. Exactly! All the more reason to help out. Come here, you. Thank you. Honey, you're gonna have your dream. We're gonna save your restaurant. But now we have a tree to decorate! Oh! Yeah!
