 Previously on Cedar Cove...  
 Then I guess But maybe I'm not cut out to play second fiddle. And maybe I'm not cut out to be with someone who's gone half the time. She messed around on me, and I don't ever want to go through that again. I am not gonna play this game with you. It's not fair, and I can't win. [♪] Seriously? More lights? You're gonna be able to see our house from space. Thank you. It's not a compliment, Bob. It's ostentatious. It's festive. It's over the top, honey. Yes, dear. Ah. Thanks. Oh. Thank you. [Traffic din, horns blaring] [♪] [Laughter] [♪ ♪] [♪] Hey! Hey! What are you doing here already, man? You're not supposed to start till the first of the year. Yeah, I know. I just flew in to sign my contract, check out my fancy new office. Yeah? Pretty amazing, right? So, this is what the big league looks like, huh? Who needs ambiance? Man, you're covering the Phillies, Jack. Hey, you don't need a window when you've got floor seats, pal. Very true, Mike. Very true. So how long you in town for? Maybe we can do dinner, or catch a Sixers game like old times, what do you say? No, I can't. I gotta go home, pack up all my stuff. I still have to find a replacement for The Chronicle. So I'm guessing things didn't work out with that woman you were seeing? Uh, no. I'm sorry, man. No. Hey, I'm over it, man. It's all good. [Slaps Jack's leg] Good to see ya. [♪] Hey! What are you doing here? You're home early. I wanted to surprise you. How did you get in? The key under the ceramic frog. You can't do that. This isn't your house. You don't live here anymore. I know. You can't just come in here and make yourself at home. Well, I'm not stealing the silver. I'm just making you dinner. Lemon chicken and roast potatoes, your favorite. That was your favorite. I shouldn't have come in without your permission. I'm just trying to do something nice for you. I'm exhausted. I've had a long day at work, and all I wanted to do was come home and relax. Okay, well, you relax, and I will pour you a glass of wine. I don't want to drink wine with you. What's wrong? You give up wine because Jack's an alcoholic? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Stan...  I love you. I always will. We had two beautiful children together, but we can't go back to that life. I know, but we can have a new life. No, we can't. We're different people now. What we need to do is be good co-parents for Justine. I don't want anything but happiness for you. But not here, and not with me. [♪] [Door rattles] [♪] Hey! [Chuckles] What are you doing here? What do you mean? I'm getting myself a cup of coffee. I thought you gave up coffee for your health. And by "coffee" I mean tea. See ya later. What about lunch? I'm busy with work. Come on, Justine. You need to take a day off. I am not independently wealthy. You could be. This is getting really old. Okay, I'm sorry. Look. I hate to see you pining over some guy who left you without a word. He didn't leave me. I'm sure he's out working on a fishing boat somewhere. So he doesn't even keep in touch? Goodbye, Warren. Sotto : Okay. Wonderful. Oh! Hi. Hi. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you. Can I help you there? Yeah. May I have a cup of green tea, please? You got it. Hey, I was wondering, is the local newspaper office closed? Oh! [Chuckles] Let's just call it a brief media pause, shall we? A small town, though, all the important news is right up here. What is it you want to know? I just wanted to check the want ads and see if anyone's hiring. Well, what kind of work you looking for? Well, I was a waitress at a sports bar, but they fired me when I started showing. Oh, for shame. "A ship under sail and a big-bellied woman are the handsomest two things that can be seen common." Benjamin Franklin. I'll tell you what, though. I could use some help around here. Really? Yep. That's great! That's amazing I wandered in here. Ah, there are no accidents in life. Everything was meant to be. Uh, you play that thing? Yeah. You see? There you go. I was also thinking that I need to get some new entertainment, try and attract the young tourists. You know any Joni Mitchell? Who? Oh! [Laughs] Uh, I'll get your tea. "Who?" [Laughs] [♪] Peg! Hey there. Hi. Do you have any rooms available? Well, you're in luck. We just had someone check out. Great. Hi. I'm Peggy Beldon. Shelly. Nice to meet you. And that is my husband, Bob, the decorator. Shelly. Welcome to the Thyme and Tide. Your home away from home. Let me take care of that for you. Oh, look at you! How far along are you, honey? Seven months. Aww. Congratulations. Thanks. So why are you here in Cedar Cove? Are you visiting family? Well...  What she means is, "welcome to the Thyme and Tide, where your business is... your business." [Laughs] Oh, no. It's just...  I, uh, I needed to get away for a little while. You know, find some peace and quiet. Well, you certainly came to the right place, then. So let's get you checked in, huh? Why don't you take her stuff to the oak room? Yep. Come on, sweetheart. Your house looks so... festive. Smart girl. She's trying to be polite, Bob. It will be great. It'll be just great. It'll be wonderful. [♪] Uh, welcome to Cedar Cove. Thank you. Beautiful part of the world. Yeah, it's a great place. Humph. Why are we taking his photos down? They're still selling. Because I still don't know where he is, and I have nowhere to send the money, so...  Sorry. I know how much you cared about him. Anything new from Seth? Not a word. One day, we're moving in together, planning our future, and the next, he's gone. Maybe we're destined to be old maids. Old maids? [Laughs] Grandma, hi. Hello, sweetheart. I was hoping you two could help me. Of course. You heard about my friend, Harriet Rogers? Yes. She passed away. I'm so sorry. It's sad, but she was 97. She had a very full life. I've been helping her kids clean out the house. Turns out she was quite the hoarder. Really? Books, antiques, collectibles. I found this painting in the attic. Seems pretty old. It's signed, but, uh, we can't read the name. Oh, my God! This looks like a Henry Morton. Is that good? It's awesome if it's real. Did they say how it got in Harriet's attic? Well, her daughter says she remembered it from years ago. She thinks her mother bought it at a garage sale. Can you tell if it's real? I'd have to take it to a museum or an art house. Pioneer Square in Seattle. There's a bunch of galleries there. I know some people who might be able to tell us. I can go later today. That is amazing. Do you think it's valuable? I've seen Mortons go at auction for hundreds of thousands of dollars. [**] Seriously, if we lose to Dallas again, I'm moving to Cedar Cove with you. Jack? Mm? What do you think? You know? The Eagles got a chance to beat Dallas Sunday or what? Absolutely. Hear, hear! Eagles! So how's that club soda treating you? Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. You really gave it up, huh? Hey, what do you do to unwind? You know, there are other things, Mike. In fact, I just recently built a canoe by myself, from scratch. [Laughing] Well, you came back just in time. Another month, and they'd have you fishing and playing a banjo. Oh, I'd never play the banjo. [Cell phone ringing] Hey, babe. Yeah, I'm working late tonight. Yeah, I'll be home as soon as I can. Don't wait up. I love you too. Ah...  Cheers, boys. Cheers! Cheers. He was in my house. Cooking! In my kitchen! He just let himself in? Oh, he got the wrong impression. If I misled him, I certainly didn't mean to. Oh, I'm so glad it's over with. What about Jack? Have you heard from him? No, and I don't think I will. I really hurt him. I don't know if he'll ever trust me again. Why do we even need men anyway? We have each other. We don't need to wear makeup, spanx, do our hair... nothing. You know, you are a lot of fun and easy to talk to, but let's face it. We love men. True. There's just something about them that we can't live without. Yeah, well, I've been living without for a long time. Maybe it's time to get back on the horse. Whatever happened to you two? I thought you were going to go on a date. I blew it. He asked me out on a couple of dates, and I just wasn't ready, and then there was that whole thing with the bachelor auction, the mess with your brother. He's made it perfectly clear he's no longer interested. You're just gonna give up? I wasn't subtle! I asked him out on two different occasions, he said he was busy. I practically threw myself at him. Try again. You want me to go to his ranch, run through his yard naked, yelling "let's go to dinner"? Why not? Because I would probably get arrested. Yes, and after your psych evaluation, you could go on a date. I think you should go out and buy a cowboy hat just in case. [♪] Hi. Where have you been? Alaska. You just left without saying a word. I know. I'm sorry. You're sorry? That's it? Do you have any idea how you made me feel? I had no idea where you were, or if you were even coming back. I was angry and hurt. Why? Because I went and saw Warren in the hospital? Yes, but that's not the only reason. I felt like I had nothing to offer you. I felt like... a loser. You felt like a loser, so you punish me? You just vanish? That is not fair. You're right. You can't just walk back into my life. How am I supposed to trust you now? I know what I did was wrong, but I went to Alaska to meet the owner of the fishery I used to work for. I needed a loan, and the banks won't give me one. A loan for what? Do you remember the plan that I told you about that I'm working on? I'm trying to find a way to stay here, so I don't have to go off on these fishing jobs, but I need money, so I sold the boat, and with this loan...  I might just have enough. Enough for what? Please, come with me. I want to show you something. [**] I already put an offer in on it. You're buying a restaurant? A restaurant and a fresh fish market. People can come in and eat fresh seafood, or they can buy it and take it home. And I have connections with the best boats and fishermen in the state, so I really think I can make this work. [♪] I think it's a wonderful idea. It'll keep me here, in Cedar Cove... with you. I'm so sorry for leaving you like that. I just didn't want to say anything until I knew I had the money together. I'm going to put everything I have into making this work. I want this for us... for our future. And I promise you, I will never leave you alone again. I missed you. [Relieved sigh] I missed you too. Are you gonna make me guess what's going on? This cute couple came in to see me today. Annie and Howard Green. I renewed their vows. It was their 60th wedding anniversary. And you're going on a second honeymoon with them? No. They told me the story of how they met. Annie was supposed to marry Sam, but she met Howard, and he swept her off her feet. She didn't know how to tell Sam, so she waited till the night before the wedding to break it to him. Poor Sam. Not the point of the story. Howard was sure she'd gone through with it, so he took a job in Japan. Annie was sure she had lost him forever. Sad. So... ? So she got on a plane, she went to Japan, and the rest is history! I see? I'm going to go to Philadelphia. I'm gonna find Jack, I'm gonna tell him I'm sorry and that I love him. Well, then you are packing all wrong. And don't give me that look. I'm sure Annie did the same thing. Whispering : Why did she come here, Bob? It's not like it's easy to get here, you know. It's her business. Now, if she wants to talk to us, she can, but it's not our place to pry. But what if she's in trouble? We're a bed-and-breakfast, not a bed-and-rescue. I don't know, it just... it seems like there's more to her story. Why are you whispering? She's been gone for over an hour. I know. I don't know. Jack : Hey! Look! Hey! It's Jack! Hey, Jack. Welcome home. Well, it's not home anymore, you two. I'm just here to clean out my place and to help fill my job at the paper. I brought you your fishing poles back. Listen, I just wanted to thank you two for...  I'm sorry, I just got to say, this is... [laughing] quite the display you've got going here! I know. I know. [Laughing] Oh, it's a contest to see who can put up the best decorations. The best or the most? You got it. Both. I gotcha. Mm-hmm. So what does the winner get for all of this? Well, you get your name on a banner and bragging rights. Ah! See, the CFC drives around from house to house, and they vote for their favorite on Christmas Eve. The, uh, "CFC"? The Christmas Festivities Committee. That's a real group? Oh, yeah. Bob is very serious about the CDA. The Christmas Decorating Aaward. Oh! Well, as you should be. Yeah. So, you seen her yet? Olivia? Yeah. Uh, no... no. Look, Bob, we... we broke up. I'm just...  I'm moving forward here. I was there, Jack. I watched you two fall in love. You made her a... a canoe with your own bare hands! Yeah, and it sunk the first time out, right? I should've known then. So you're gonna quit? I never took you for a pessimist. You've always been that kind of... you know, uh, glass-half-full guy. [Sighs] Oh, I'm still that guy, Bob. But when I think of my future with Olivia, that glass, like the canoe, it's... it's half empty. [Engine starts] Take care, man. 
 
 [♪] Hi! Grace! Bought a hat. I want to sign up for riding lessons. Okay, now, Grace...  I'm serious! Twice a week for several months. What? You're gonna turn down business? You want to learn how to ride all of a sudden? Well, I have to. I have no choice. I already bought the hat. [Laughs] All right. I'll see you at the ranch, then. [Starts truck] [♪] [Dialing] Please, please...  Hi, Olivia? Listen to me. I hope you get this. If you've not yet left for Philadelphia, do not go, because Jack is right here in Cedar Cove. Jack, you're back! Hey! Just for a few days. Oh, I thought maybe you and Olivia...  No. No, sorry, Charlotte. I'm sorry too. You're just here to pack up your stuff, then? Yeah, and to try and find my replacement, which is turning out to be easier said than done. Hey, you tell me. Do you think beekeeping or dental hygienistry are good stepping stones to be a newspaper reporter? How about this guy, who addressed his cover letter to "dear sir or madman"? [Scoffs] Oh! I'm not making this stuff up! You set the bar so high. Yeah, thanks, Charlotte, but you know what? I am positive that there is somebody somewhere out there more than capable of, you know, covering bake sales and art walks. Problem is, you didn't just cover our events, you gave them life. You made us all look at the town in a new light. The Chronicle became the voice of Cedar Cove, and let's face it... you are The Chronicle. Thank you, Charlotte. So anything else going on out there? Oh, not much. Other than the feds are poking around. Uh... what? A man in a dark suit came into town, talking to Troy. And your sure it was the feds? I mean, it could've just been a businessman in a dark suit, maybe. I know everybody in this town. Trust me, he is not from around here. And another thing. Troy's been wearing a tie to work all week, and he looks nervous. Troy looks nervous? Might be something to look into. Unless you're in a big hurry to get back to Philadelphia. [Sighs] My realtor called. My offer to buy the restaurant was rejected. What? I did some checking. The company who owns it? It's one of Warren's. I should've known! He practically owns everything in this town. I don't believe this. Obviously when he found out it was me making the offer, he decided to raise the asking price. You don't know that. Justine, when are you gonna realize who Warren Saget really is? [Ferry horn blasts] Maryellen : Hey! So I just left the gallery, and they're gonna let me know later today if it's authentic. The woman said she thought it was one of a series of paintings done in the early 1950s by Morton. She said it was one of a group of paintings that was stolen from a collector's home in New York in 1963. How well did you know Harriet? Anyway, the whole thing is a mystery, and I...  I'll call you back. Hi. Excuse me. Where did you get this picture? I bought it from a guy on the street. What street? Where? That's you, isn't it? The guy you bought it from, did he tell you his name? Is he showing at your gallery? I didn't ask his name. He didn't seem like the kind of guy who would show in a gallery. Actually, he looked kind of down on his luck. I bought it because I liked it, but I also felt sorry for him. I only paid $50 for it. I'll give you 100. Sold. Here you go. Where was he when you saw him? The mouth of the alley on 22nd Street, but this was a few days ago. I doubt he'd still be there. [♪] You're back. Yeah. Just temporary. Tying up a few loose ends, you know. How's the job? Oh, I actually don't start until the new year, but I'm pretty excited. It's a dream come true. I need to tell you... Olivia... Don't. We don't need to go through this again. I'm actually pretty busy here, so...  Jack, I'm sorry for everything that happened. Oh, come on, let's be honest about this, Olivia. There's no way I'd be happy settling in a small town like this, right? You got your whole life here. You got your family here. Look, you were right about Stan. I couldn't see it. No, you don't owe me any explanations, all right? We both moved on. I'm okay with it. I don't believe that's how you feel. Well, it doesn't really matter how I feel anymore, does it? It matters to me. Look, we had a great time. It was fun. Let's not get carried away. I came here to tell you that you're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time, and I love you. [Door closes] [Knocking at door] [Sniffles deeply] Come in. Hey there. Hey. I thought you might like some tea and a little snack. Oh. Thank you. That's so nice of you. I remember when I was pregnant, I ate everything in sight. [Laughs] So I'm going into town later. You want me to pick you up anything? I'm fine. Thanks. Okay. Feel free to use the phone. We have free long distance for our guests, so if you have any family or friends you might want to call? Uh, thanks, but there's no one to call. Don't you have anyone to help you out when the baby's born? It's okay. I'm not gonna keep it. I'm giving it up for adoption. Oh, I see. I want her to have the best life possible, and right now, the life I have to give her isn't all that great, and...  Truth is, I'm having a hard enough time taking care of myself. I could never take care of her. Is there anything I can do to help? I need a lawyer. I know someone. [Knocking] Yes? Hi. Hi! You must be Shelly. Peggy said you were gonna come by, but she didn't say why. Come on in. Have a seat. Thank you. How can I help you? I need to speak with someone about what I need to do if I want to give my baby up for adoption. Is the birth father involved? Does it matter? Well, the adoption's less likely to be challenged if the father cooperates. There's different laws in different states. He's not gonna be a problem, believe me. I don't know where he is, and he has no interest in being a dad. Have you given this a lot of thought? Have you spoken to a counselor, your family, your church? Adoption is a huge step...  I know, I know, and I have thought about it a lot, and it is what I want to do. Okay. I can help you. Have you thought about whether you want to have a private or open adoption? Open's where I get to go and visit, be a part of her life? There's all kinds of arrangements that can be made. It's up to you and the couple to make a plan. I think I'd want a private adoption. I wouldn't want her to be confused about who her mother is, and, I mean, I wouldn't be her mother anymore, would I? You keep saying "her". Do you know it's a girl? Yes. I had a sonogram a few weeks ago. It's a girl. Sometimes I wish I didn't know that, though. I find I'm thinking about her all the time now. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly? I don't have one here yet, but I... I have been taking really good care of myself. I've been taking prenatal vitamins and everything. Well, I'm gonna give you the name and number of my doctor. She's very nice. I'll call her and tell her that you're gonna come in. Thank you. What's the next step? Well...  I call the adoption agency, and we move forward. Thank you so much for the doctor's number. I'll call her right away. Good. Oh! What do I owe you? All I did was give you a telephone number. Thank you. Shelly? Take good care of yourself. [Sighs] Listen. Listen, Larry, I'm sorry, but I'm not signing anything, anything, unless you get me confirmation on those zoning issues. You understand me? How could you do this? Uh, listen, Larry, I gotta go. I gotta call you back. Bye. Look, before you start in on me, let me explain myself. It was a huge misunderstanding. Here it comes, another lie. I'm not lying! Just listen to me for a second, okay? Look, the listing price on the restaurant was already raised before Seth put in his offer. They brought in a couple of new realtors, they neglected to tell them the new price, and the lady gave him the wrong numbers. It was a nightmare. So then lower the price! I wish I could, Justine, but I can't. Of course you can! You own the property! Yes, one of my development companies owns the property. So what? It was appraised at a new price! You don't just go walk in there and reduce it. Look, I'm sorry, okay, but I got people that work for this company. I have to look out for them. Meaning yourself. And I'm not gonna stop doing what's in the best interests of my business. Yeah, especially if it means preventing Seth from starting a restaurant in town! There's nothing personal here, Justine! I don't care if he owns a restaurant! [Sighs heavily] All right, look. Do I still have feelings for you? Sure. I admit it. Am I happy that we ended our engagement? No. Did I want him to come back? No! But he's here, isn't he? I will not get in the way of him owning his own restaurant, I promise. So if he can come up with the additional funds to make the offer, you'll accept it? Of course. [Sighs] Slow day. You should add some wifi, attract the local tourists. Ah, I'm not Starbucks. Look, you can knock off, if you want. No sense both of us standing around doing nothing. Thanks. See ya.

Olivia has been my best friend since we were kids. I have always known what is going on in her head, sometimes before she does. She is in love with you. You're in love with her. The sooner you both realize this, the sooner you can get on with your lives. Right this way. Oh, wonderful. What's this? Our offer for the restaurant. Where's your realtor? Don't need her. It's the exact price you asked for. Where'd you get the rest of the money? From me. We're buying the restaurant together. Really? You promised that you would accept the offer if we came up with the listing price. Okay. Offer's accepted. What's the catch? Seth, please, not today. Relax. You've got yourself a restaurant. Now, we all know it could take a few weeks going through escrow, so... this is what I thought I'd do. [Rattling] In good faith...  I'm gonna give you the keys...  Now. [♪] Good luck. Thank you. It's beautiful. It's ours. Sure you're ready for this? It's gonna be a lot of work. I have never been more ready. I'm gonna paint a big mural right here on this wall. [Gulls crying] [Footsteps] [Thumps roof] Hey! Welcome to Cedar Cove. Jack Griffith. Cedar Cove Chronicle. [Laughs] So...  Hi there. What brings you to town? Uh, just passing through. You know. Really? That's funny. The last time the feds were in town, they were asking all these questions about Warren Saget. Is this part of that investigation? [Chuckling] Wow. You have a vivid imagination. What, uh, what makes you think that I'm a...  What was it? A fed? Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's the dark suit, the number-two haircut...  I'm not really sure what screams the loudest. You see, it's part of my job to be observant, so...  Right. Well, Mr. Griffith, I appreciate that this is, you know, your job, but I really can't help you right now. Okay. But you will when you can, right? Oh, sure, sure, because, you know, I... I owe you that. [Starts engine] Is that on the record? Can I quote you on that, by the way? [Cackles victoriously] How was it that time? That was better. At least you got her to stop this time. I did! Good job, Miss Annabelle! I gotta tell you, though, I really could use a pillow. You ready to come down? I thought you'd never ask. Okay, reins, horn. Leg. Oh! I gotcha. Whoa! [Laughs] My parents called me "Grace." Little ironic, don't you think? That's embarrassing. Okay, you get the pizza, I'll get the wine, and I'll meet you back at the apartment to celebrate. Sounds good. Justine Lockhart? I'd like to talk to you. Hi, Peggy! Hello, favorite judge. I met with the young girl you sent here. She's so sweet, and I'm gonna help her in any way I can. Oh, thank you. She's actually the reason I'm here. What's wrong? I should probably go to Jack, but I don't know how to tell him this. But I have to tell someone. It's too important, and there's too much at stake. I know I shouldn't have been snooping, but...  I found some photos in Shelly's room. That's Eric, right? Jack's son. Oh...
