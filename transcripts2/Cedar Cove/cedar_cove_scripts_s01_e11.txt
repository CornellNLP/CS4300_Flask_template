 Previously on Cedar Cove...  
 I can't stop thinking about you. 
 You are a married man. 
 You seem familiar with his work. 
 Yes. I'm... I'm a big fan. 
 I know that you want to see if Olivia will take you back. 
 And you're gonna go to Philadelphia? 
 Yeah. Just for a couple of days. 
 Olivia : But what if he offers you the job? 
 [Relieved sigh] 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 There he is. 
 So? Talk to me. How'd it go? 
 [Exhales] 
 It went... well. 
 Exceedingly well. 
 They offered you a job? 
 They did. 
 [Claps] Yes! 
 I will have a cranberry soda, please. 
 And I'll have another, please. 
 Thank you. 
 Wow. 
 That's great, man! 
 Full-time assignment, covering major league baseball. 
 Y... you're kidding me, right? 
 The Phillies? 
 Hot-stove league, spring training, regular season coverage, traveling with the team for all away games. 
 You know, I'm so happy for you. You deserve it, man. 
 You know, you've really turned your life around. 
 Thank you. 
 Listen, Mike, you really, uh, you came through for me, man. 
 I owe you. 
 Yes, you do! 
 And you can start with, uh, season tickets, third-base line, behind the dugout. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So when do you start? 
 What? What's the problem? 
 I told them that I need to think it over. 
 This is your dream job. 
 Yeah. 
 But it's also a full-time job. 
 So? 
 So... I would have to move back here. 
 Jack, you're currently living in a town that's not even on the map. 
 You're writing stories about bake sales and community theater productions. 
 I mean... dude. 
 This isn't just any big city sports-writing gig. 
 This... this is the Phillies. 
 I know. 
 You know? 
 Okay, well, if you know, then what's holding you back? 
 [**] 
 [Knocking] 
 Hey, Stan. What are you doing here? 
 I need to talk to you. 
 Okay. 
 I know Melanie came to see you. 
 Yeah, I think she's gotten the wrong idea about us. 
 Yeah, well. 
 She's always felt threatened by you. 
 I'm sorry, Stan, really. 
 Oh, don't be. 
 It's not your problem. 
 It's hers. Or ours. 
 Which is why I've made a decision, I'm moving out. 
 I'm ready for a new beginning. 
 Moving out? 
 What are you talking about? A divorce? 
 Contacted my lawyer to start the process. 
 So you're gonna run out on her now? 
 Oh, come on, Olivia. 
 I've tried to make it work. You know I have. 
 But she won't accept me spending time here, not even with Justine. 
 I can't go on like that. 
 Would you move back to Cedar Cove? 
 It doesn't have to be Cedar Cove. 
 I could move to Lakewood, or Cooperton. 
 You don't think me moving here is a good idea. 
 I didn't say that. 
 You didn't have to. 
 We were married a long time. 
 I can see it in your eyes. 
 Your moving back impacts more than just Justine. 
 I know. 
 And I won't do it, if you don't want me to. 
 I'm staying at the Thyme and Tide for now. 
 I won't make any decisions until you've had a chance to think it over. 
 [♪] 
 She was John's mother? 
 I don't know. I think so. 
 Her email address said "Kirkland", which was the name I saw on all those unopened letters in his apartment. 
 You think his real name is Kirkland, and he changed it to Bowman? 
 Why would he do that? 
 That's what I wanted to find out, but he wouldn't tell me. 
 So what're you going to do? 
 I'm going to have to find out on my own. 
 He's not going to like that. 
 Oh, probably not, but I need to know his story. 
 I've had enough of the mystery. 
 Well, when you're done, maybe you can help me unravel a mystery of my own. 
 Still no word from Seth? 
 Nothing. 
 He probably just took that fishing job up in Alaska. 
 I called the fishery. 
 He never showed up. 
 Maybe he got a better offer from another company. 
 Then where's his boat? 
 If he took a fishing job in Alaska, his boat would still be at the marina, and it's gone. 
 I have no idea where he went. 
 [**] 
 Delilah, on radio : I will always take a chance. 
 The alternative is not living a full life. 
 So, take the chances and the opportunities put in front of you. 
 You're listening to Delilah. [Jack starts laughing] That would be me. Welcome home. Aw! Mm-mm! How was Philadelphia? Loud, crowded and in a big, big rush. Hey. I got you something. Ta-dah! Does that mean you got the job? No! No. Just something from the airport. Oh, how romantic. [Laughs] Here. How was the interview? Oh, I think it went well. They seem to really, really like me. Good. Don't keep me in suspense. Did you get the job or not? I don't know. I guess we're just gonna have to wait and see. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Come on. Let me take you to lunch. That sounds great. Why are you going to Tacoma? I need to talk to the manager of the restaurant John used to work at. Yeah, but I thought you already did that. On the phone. But maybe I can pull more out of him if I go see him face-to-face. Mm, I don't think I like this. I'll be fine. Drink your tea. It's calming. I am very calm, thank you. Come here. You do not need to worry about me, okay? I can't help it. You haven't been yourself lately. I'm just tired. He's not still texting you, is he? When is this guy going to leave town? In a few days. Good. Just hang in there and ignore the texts, then he'll be gone, and you never have to think about Will Jeffers again. I've been torturing myself, wondering if he's been lying to me, or he's been lying to Olivia, and then I realized it doesn't matter, because either way, he is a liar. Exactly. And he doesn't deserve any more of your time. Just wait it out, and soon, everything will be back to normal. You'll see. You need to lay down a coat of liquid epoxy to seal the wood and fill in the cracks. Bob, what are you talking about? I already did that. Look. You're gonna have to do it again. There's cracks showing. Right here. Where? Right there. You need a solid ship, Jack, or there's no sense putting 'er in the water. The sea has a way of finding your mistakes. Jack grumbles : Argh. Fine. So what's the rush anyway? I mean, it's obvious you're in a big hurry to build this canoe. Is there someplace else you've got to be? Now, why would you be asking me that? Oh, I don't know. Word on the street has it you went to Philly for a job interview. "Word on the street"? Charlotte. Ahh. How'd it go? [Sighing deeply] Come on! Good. They offered it to you, didn't they? Are you gonna take it? You know, Bob, there was a time in my life when I wouldn't have thought twice about it, but, um...  I lost everything once, and I'm just not gonna let that happen again. I hear you. I've been there. Priorities, right? Priorities. I'm just not going to let work come before my sobriety and everything else in my life. And by "everything else" you mean Olivia? I finally got a voice-mail from Seth today. That's good. What'd he say? Not much. Just that he was sorry and he has "a plan" in the works. Something that will benefit the both of us. What plan? I don't know. He didn't say. He just said to be patient. Mm, I can relate to that. I'm kind of going through the same thing right now. With Jack? Yeah. You know, this whole thing with Philadelphia. I don't know how that's gonna play out. You're worried that he's gonna go back there? Of course. And even if he doesn't, what's the next thing that'll come along and take him away at a moment's notice? The not-knowing... it's not fun. No, it isn't. Did Seth say where he was? No. Well, at least you know he's safe. Part of me wonders if it's all even worth it. [Phone rings] Hello? Hi, Stan. Yeah, she's right here. Meet you where? Right now? Hey! You bought a boat? That's just like the one we used to have. Come on board and we'll go for a little spin. I don't think so. Oh, come on! You loved our boat. You did, too. Yeah, we all did. Come on. Just a quick ride out to the point. It could be fun. I don't know, you guys. Come on, mom. One little spin. [Laughs] Oh, alright. Justine, can you get the lines? There we go. [Engine purrs] Okay, let's see what this baby can do. [Knocking] Can I help you? Yes. Hi. I'm Maryellen Sherman. We spoke on the phone awhile back. Lady, I talk to about 50 people on the phone every day. Right. Of course. I called you about one of your former chefs, John Bowman. Yeah. I asked you why you fired him, you said he lied on his application. That's right. But you wouldn't tell me what he lied about. You said "ask John." And did you? Yes. But he wouldn't tell me either. Yeah, that figures. Tough break. Excuse me. Look. The reason I called...  I'm opening up a restaurant in Cedar Cove and I'm thinking about hiring John. He's an incredible chef. Yeah, he is. Best I've ever worked with. Then why did you fire him? What did he lie about? I know there's something he's not telling me. Please. I've put every cent I have into this place. I need to know if there's anything I should be worried about with this guy. One of the questions on our job application asks if you've ever been convicted of a felony. He answered "no." He was in prison? Yeah. For what? That's all I know. I'm sorry. [♪] And he didn't even tell you where he was going? No. That's not like Seth, to disappear without saying anything. Well, whatever he's up to, I just hope just he realizes what he's putting you through. Sorry. Listen to me...  Like I should be giving anybody relationship advice. Hey, you remember when we used to come out here and skip stones? It was a tournament of champions. Jordan always had us beat. He got up to seven. I think it was eight. [Laughs] Come on, dad. Let's see what you've got. Groans : Oh... alright. Alright. Let's see what you got. I got to find a good one. That's alright. That was not a good one. Two! Two. [**] [Children giggling] [**] Stan : Get a nice flat one! There. Take that one there. There's a good one. Okay, from the side. Stan : Good one, Jordan. Jordan : Thanks, dad. Justine : Good job, Jordan. [♪] Olivia? You alright? It's so nice to be out here again. Isn't it? It is. I should've never left. It was the single biggest mistake of my life. I missed you. We'd better go. [♪] I drove down to Tacoma. Why? I went to the fire water grill. Is it true? Were you really in prison? Yes. Why? It was a drug charge. What happened? It doesn't matter. It happened. Why didn't you tell me? Because it's not something I'm proud of. Okay? I don't walk around bragging about a thing like that. I still deserve to know. What else have you been keeping from me? Nothing. Because I need to know if there's anything else you're not telling me. I'm sorry. John...  I really am sorry. I can't be here right now. You can't just walk out in the middle of your shift! [Buffer whirring] [Buffer powers down] Wow...  I'm impressed. It's gorgeous! Yeah, it's getting there, isn't it? Hey. I stopped by your place earlier. Something I wanted to tell you in person. Yeah, I had some things I had to do. I just wanted to tell you that, uh...  They did offer me that job. Full-time sportswriter, covering the Phillies. Full-time? I turned it down. What? Jack... that's your dream job. Yeah, it is. What can I say? I, uh... [sighs] I like Cedar Cove better. You know? The, uh... the fresh air, the clean water... mostly the people. Certain people in particular. Hey... you're not the only person who can turn down a dream job, you know. I can't believe you did that. Bob : Ain't she a beauty? [Jack clears his throat] She certainly is. Yeah, Jack's come a long way since that picture frame he made you. I love that picture frame. Yeah, but to make a canoe by hand... that's some gesture. Yeah, Bob. I think she gets it. Uh...  [Laughs] Well, um, I'll get out of your way. Hey, listen. Uh... something you wanted to talk about? You seemed a little anxious. No, I... I wanted to ask about the job. I'll call you later. Okay. [♪] Warren! What are you doing here? Ah, it's my daily run. Same as you. You don't run. I do now. It's my attempt to de-stress after work. Is it working? Surprisingly, no. I just feel sweaty all the time. But it is part of my new outlook. How about you? I run here every day. You know that. So what are you saying? That I came here, hoping to run into you? No, it's just a huge coincidence. It could be! Look. I'm trying to make some real changes here, Justine. You know? Live a healthier life, be a better person. Those are some real ambitious goals. I wish you luck with that. Starting with running. Now, you don't mind if I tag along with you, do you? Not a problem. As long as you think you can keep up. Are you serious? Come on. I ran track in high school! Key words there being "high school." [Panting] Oh, no. No. Don't go that fast. [Wheezing] Okay...  Ah! Ah... oh...  Grace : What kind of drug charge? He wouldn't tell me. He just walked off the job, right in...  ... the middle of his shift. He quit? I don't know. Well, it's probably for the best. God only knows what other secrets he's keeping from you. Honey, it's gonna be okay. [Sighs] I just... I wish he would've told me. That's what bothers me the most. Well, sometimes, people like that find it hard to talk about that sort of thing. That's just it. I don't think he is "like that." I look at his art, I look into his eyes...  John's no criminal. I'm just saying I think there's more to this. There has to be some kind of explanation. More secrets. Terrific. You just be careful, Maryellen. I will. Don't worry about me. I have to. It's my job. 
 
 [Telephone rings] Hey, Olivia! W... you want to meet right... right now? So, what's this big news you wanted to tell me about? Stan's leaving Melanie. What? They're getting a divorce and he's moving back here. Here? As in Cedar Cove-here? And how do you feel about that? Well, I'm happy for Justine...  Yeah, but it isn't exactly ideal to be sharing a zip code with your ex-husband. He took us out to the point. We were out on the beach, skipping stones, and, for a minute there, I was back in time, and it was all so perfect. He told me that he regretted leaving me, and that he missed me. Okay, wait a minute. So he's coming back here for you? He wants to get back with you? I don't know! I don't know! Well, what does Jack say about all this? I haven't told him yet. Why not? Well, he gave up that big job to stay here with me. I know, I need to tell him before somebody else does. Your business finally brings you close to home, and I've hardly seen you. I've been so busy. You know you're my favorite girl. Mr. Big-Shot. Always so wrapped up in your work. It's time you took over that company entirely. Why don't you call up the ceo and tell him to resign? You know what? I'll do that. [Chuckles] Shh...  The judge is deliberating. What? What's with you? Stan's moving back to Cedar Cove. Ah...  The ex-husband returns. Way to cramp your style, huh? That's not it. You really don't mind that Stan's moving back here? I don't know how I feel. Hushed : Back up! Do not make a sound. Hey! Look who's here. Hushed : What are you doing? Making him squirm. Hi there! Hello, ladies! Mwah. Hi, sweetheart. Hello, will. Grace. I haven't seen you around. Well, I've been avoiding you. [Forced chuckle] She's just kidding. [Laughs] Funny. So, how's dinner? Will's headed home in a few days, so I've been spending as much time as I can with him. Really. Why so soon? I have to head back to Atlanta. Ah. Back to your wife. That is where she lives. And I hear you have this fabulous trip... planned together. Pardon? Mm-hmm, yeah, Olivia told me all about it. France! How charming. Why don't you join us? Sure! Oh, no, thanks, we can't stay. We can't? We need to drop off that thing? That's right, too. We do have that thing to drop off. Well, you all enjoy yourselves now. [**] Mom, you can't be playing games like this. Trust me, it's not a game. Maryellen? Thank you for meeting me. I don't know what to call you. Mrs. Bowman? Mrs. Kirkland? Donna. Please. Can I get you anything? Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine. I was so glad you emailed me. Does Daniel... I mean, John... know? No. He'd probably be very angry if he found out. He is your son, right? Yes. But he hasn't spoken to me or his father in years. I learned he spent time in prison. A drug charge? What happened? May I ask first what your relationship is with him? Honestly, I...  I don't know. We've dated a few times. I like him a lot. He's a... [laughs] a wonderful artist and chef, but...  I can't live with all the secrecy. He won't tell me anything. [Sighs] John spent five years in jail. What kind of drug charge was it? Was he dealing? Oh, no. No, no. He...  John had an older brother, Jim. Straight "A" student. Class president. He and John were pulled over for speeding, and Jim... was carrying drugs, and he hid them under the front seat. The cops found them? Because it was John's car, he was the one who was arrested. He pleaded with the cops, told them the drugs weren't his, but... [sighs] No one believed him. No one? Not even you? His... his father and I, we...  Why didn't Jim tell the truth? He let his brother go to jail? [Sighs] John was four months from completing his sentence when Jim... died of a heroin overdose. And that's when we learned the truth. John hasn't spoken to us since. We've been looking for him, trying to reach out to him. We knew he changed his name, and now he's probably gone again. And who knows if I'll find him this time. [**] [Chuckling with pride] No...  Oh, come on! No! Again? What? What are you, stalking me now? I told you this already, this is my daily run. That's why I left earlier today. Justine, come on. You didn't have fun with me last time? I even let you beat me. - You let me? Yeah! Alright, fine. Look. If you don't want company, just say the word, and I'll leave you alone. I don't want company. Where's Seth been, anyway? I haven't seen him around lately. Alright, if you're gonna insist on running with me, can you at least keep quiet? I will. Absolutely. Under one condition. We ease the pace a little bit. I'm more of a slow-and-steady kind of guy. Slow and steady? Yeah, we do that, I promise you, I'll stay quiet. Oh! Come on. No. Why did I not see that one coming? Justine...  Okay. Calls out : I'm only doing this once! 'Cause I will never be able to get out of bed after this! [Sloshing] Hey, Jack. Hey. What happened here? Oh, just re-enacting the Titanic. Oh. Sorry to hear that. Yeah. Well, back to the drawing board, I guess. Hey! Uh... is that your boat? Yeah. Just bought it. Ah. So, what, you're just gonna keep it here while you visit Justine? Olivia didn't tell you? Tell me what? I'm moving back. My wife and I separated. So you're coming back here? Well, I want to be closer to Justine. You know what? Don't give me that. Alright? Just don't. You came back here for Olivia. No, Jack. But, listen...  No, no. You listen to me. Look, Stan, it's time for you to man up, alright? Admit that you still have feelings Olivia. It's more complicated than that. Yeah, you bet it is. Because she's with me. I know that, and I'm trying to be respectful. You're not trying to be respectful! You're here! Look, why don't you just admit it? You want her back, don't you? Yells : Come on, Stan! Just say it! I want her back. Exactly. So what are we supposed to do about this? Well, I don't think it's for you or I to decide. Is it? Yeah. You're right. Thanks for the water. My pleasure. I always come prepared. How are you feeling, anyway? Actually, better. Better than ever. And by "better," I mean incredibly sore. What is that? It's aspirin. Like I said, I always come prepared. Turning my life around, Justine, and I have you to thank for that. Warren, I...  No, no. Hear me out. Seriously. I mean it. If it wasn't for you and your father, I don't know what would've happened. I just want to say how thankful I am that you were there for me. I just wish there was someone out there looking out for you, too. Warren, don't start. What? I'm not starting anything. I'm just... I don't know. I'm just thinking about this guy, Seth. I mean, what guy walks out on such an amazing woman like you? I mean, it's ridiculous. He didn't walk out on me. Oh, okay. He didn't? Well, I'm sorry. I std corrected. Look, Warren, what we had...  Is in the past. I know. And I'm okay with that. Look, I'm just looking for a running buddy, okay? Is that too much to ask? I should get going. W... I can drive you home. No, thanks. Same time tomorrow? If you can find me. [♪] [Rustling] Jack! Why didn't you tell me that Stan was moving back here? I should have. You told him that you were okay with that? Him living here? He wants to be close to Justine. You know, I am so sick of him playing that card with you. What are you talking about? He's back here for you, Olivia. Don't do this. No, no. Listen to me. He told me himself that he still has feelings for you. Do you still have feelings for him? He's the father of my children. That's not the question I'm asking, and you know it. [Chuckles sadly] Look, you two clearly have things to work out. I should have realized that the first time I saw you two together in your kitchen. You're right. Stan and I share a lot of the same memories. Some of them are sweet and some of them are so horrible they cut me to my core. He wants to make up for walking out on us. He wants a chance to talk about the pain that we lived through. No. He doesn't want your forgiveness. No! He wants you, Olivia! He thinks that he can just rewind everything and pick up where he left off. Well, that's not what I want. But do you know that? I mean, do you know how you're gonna feel for sure? Listen, for years, you've been waiting for him to come back here and resolve things with you. Well, guess what? Now he's here. God, I just feel so stupid. I am the first man that you have had a serious relationship with since your divorce... that's why he's back. He felt you slipping away. Jack, you know how much I care about you. I know with my whole heart that you're the woman for me, but I'm not gonna play this game. It's not fair, and I can't win. Jack! No, no. I am not doing this. He was so angry and hurt. I don't blame him. He let his guard down, we both did, and he gave up that incredible job to stay here with me. Yeah, but that doesn't mean that anything is going to change. Well, Stan moving back certainly complicates things. Your life is with Jack now. You... you can't keep...  [Footsteps] Will! What are you doing here? I was looking for you, actually. Called your office, and they said...  No, you weren't. You were looking for me. Your brother's been calling and texting me, Olivia. Grace...  I'm not lying to her anymore. What're you talking about? Will you tell her, or should I? Tell me what? Go ahead, tell her. Tell her how you're leaving your wife, Will. What? Is that true? No. I didn't say that I was leaving her...  Are you kidding me? You told me that repeatedly! I think she may have misinterpreted a few things. Misinterpreted? Just like when you kissed me? Did I misinterpret that? You kissed her? It was a stupid mistake after one too many glasses of wi...  I told you that, Grace. I apologized. Yes, you did, you did apologize, right before you said you wanted to see me again. Look, Olivia, it's complicated. Complicated? What are you talking about? I just talked to Georgia. If you're thinking of leaving her, she has no idea. How could you do this? She was a Saint, taking you back the last time you pulled something like this. It's not like that! Just get out of here! I don't even want to look at you. He told me he was having trouble with his marriage. All I wanted to do was be there for him, to console him, but he kissed me. Grace. He's married. He said it was over. And you believed him? Well, I wasn't sure, I got confused. Well, you've always had a thing for him. He kissed me! And how hard did you try to stop him? I pushed him away! He's been the one doing all the calling and the texting. This is gonna kill Georgia. How could you do this to me? I didn't do anything to you, and I understand that you are upset about a lot of things, but don't you put all of this on me. Yes, I'm upset, but the one thing I thought I could count on was my best friend not going behind my back and lying to me. [Knocking] John, come on, I know you're in there! Open up. Can I come in? What're you doing? You're leaving? I told the landlord I'd be gone by the end of the week. Why? Because of me? I know how this goes. The word gets around that I was in prison, and then the job disappears, the friends disappear. Well, thanks a lot for assuming I'd be like everyone else. So you don't mind that I spent time behind bars? No. That's exactly what my last girlfriend said. Then, a week later, she dumped me. Because of that? Or because you're a secretive person who won't let anyone into your life? I know what happened, John. I know about your brother, and...  I know your real name is Daniel. She came by the gallery again? Your mother? No. I contacted her this time. I... I would've preferred to talk to you, but you walked out on me last time. She's sorry about what happened, John, about everything...  You should leave now. Is this how you want to spend the rest of your life? Running away and hiding? Being angry at your family? At the world? I don't care about what happened to you before. I want to be a part of your life now. And if you want to be a part of mine, then stop running. And no more secrets. [♪] There you are. I have nothing more to say to you. You have every right to be mad at me. I couldn't have handled that worse. I'm trying to apologize! Apologize to your wife. Grace! [Footsteps] Please, just let me explain. Leave me alone. Not until you listen! Hey. Hey! You heard the lady. Leave her alone. This isn't your business. Grace? Stay out of it! [Smack, thud] [Groans] [Will groaning] Oh, Cliff. I'm so sorry you had to get involved in that. You shouldn't be treated that way. You are a true gentleman. You always were. Cliff, wait! I have been acting like a complete idiot lately, starting with that whole mess with the bachelor auction, bailing on our date, and then this ridiculous notion that...  You don't have to explain yourself. Yes, I do! I want to make it up to you. Really, not necessary. Please? I really enjoy your company, and would like it very much if we could just have dinner sometime together. I don't think so, Grace. What just happened back there, I walked in on a moment like that with my ex-wife. Your ex-wife? I don't like to talk about it, but she messed around on me, and I don't want to ever go through that again. I'm really sorry, Grace. [♪] Justine : It's me again. I just talked to the harbor master, and he told me that you sold your boat. Why would you do that? Call me back. Seth, where are you? ♪ when the night ♪
