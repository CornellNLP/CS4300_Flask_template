 Previously on Cedar Cove... 
 Jack! 
 Jeri? 
 Hey... 
 Hey! 
 He doesn't want to have a baby right now. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Stop taking birth control. 
 So... what do you want to do now? 
 Do you want me to take my hand back? 
 I don't know. 
 [Printer whirring] 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 You look exhausted! 
 Oh, you always say the sweetest things. 
 [Laughing] 
 So, did you get any sleep? 
 Uh, 20 minutes in that chair. 
 But! 
 I finished my article on Luke. 
 In one day? 
 And one very long night. 
 Wow. 
 Oh! It felt so great! Just like the old days. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. I forgot how much I loved the pressure of a deadline. 
 I've never seen you this excited about your writing. 
 Well... it's a different kind of writing. 
 I mean... I love all the eagle scout, largest-ball-of-twine, bird-calling stuff that I cover for the chronicle, but when you're dealing with somebody's life story... 
 You weigh each word, each sentence, and it is such a rush when you get it right. 
 And I think I did. 
 The online edition went out this morning at 5 A.M. 
 For the non-Internet-savvy, it'll be the afternoon edition of the chronicle, and for you... 
 Your very own copy. 
 No, no, uh, not-not here. 
 I can't stand being in the same room when someone's reading my work. 
 Oh, come on. 
 [Laughing] No! No, I mean it. 
 Seriously. Ugh. 
 Once, I, uh, was sitting next to a guy on a bus and he was reading my column. 
 I got off nine blocks early. 
 It was raining. 
 I cannot handle it. 
 But it's just me. 
 Exactly! 
 And if you so much as furrow that beautiful brow of yours, I'm gonna want to do a complete rewrite. 
 I have never seen this side of you. 
 [Laughs] 
 Only comes out during a full Moon. 
 [Both laughing] 
 Anyways, tell me, what does your day look like? 
 Well, I have an early lunch with Rebecca. 
 We have to work together, so I might as well be cordial. 
 I know it's not gonna be easy. She's a tough nut to crack. 
 You should try a hammer. 
 Really big one. 
 She's new. She's just looking for someone to extend a hand. 
 Mm. That's very admirable... 
 If slightly optimistic. 
 One of us has to be. 
 Mm. 
 All right. 
 Ooh! 
 [Laughs] 
 Bye. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hi. 
 [Surprised]: Hi! 
 You okay? 
 Not exactly. 
 What's the matter? 
 Oh, I've been up all night. 
 That's goin' around. 
 What happened? 
 You were absolutely right. 
 About what? 
 Will. 
 [Liquid pours] 
 Mm. Breakfast of champions. 
 That's your third one. 
 I need an immediate sugar jolt followed by a copious amount of caffeine just to leave the house. 
 Thanks for breakfast. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Hey, uh, I gotta take this. 
 Hey! 
 Oh, yeah. No. I'm just having breakfast. 
 So what's up? 
 Yeah? When were you thinking? 
 That's great. 
 Yeah, I... 
 I'll see you at the ferry. 
 No. 
 It's no problem. 
 Uh, I'm just... uh, ahem, I'm just running late for work right now, so... 
 How about I call you tonight and we'll sort it all out? 
 Right. 
 Bye. 
 [Beep] 
 Who was that? 
 Shelly and Adele. 
 Who are Shelly and Adele? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Do you ever get tired of being right? 
 All the time. All the time! 
 [Sighs wearily] 
 What happened? 
 I did not want to have feelings for will, and I didn't have feelings for will, except for friendship. 
 Then he put his hand on top of mine, and suddenly I'm back in high school. 
 But Cliff? 
 I love him, but that's moving too fast for me. 
 Don't you see? You were afraid this was gonna happen, and it happened. 
 Well, but nothing's really happened, has it? 
 With will? No. 
 Last night I told him I wasn't feeling very well, which was not exactly a lie, and he took me home. 
 I just need time to clear my head. 
 Okay. So let's see. 
 Cliff is gone for a couple of days. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Will leaves today. 
 Take a deep breath, and more importantly, take your time. 
 You're gonna figure this out. 
 What if I don't? 
 Oh. 
 How's your grad school application coming? 
 Well, everything's in... transcripts, letters of reference. 
 Now they're just waiting for my personal statement, which is... 
 Almost done? 
 Terrible. 
 [Laughs] What? 
 I have to write about an achievement that shaped my life. 
 Doesn't sound so tough. 
 Says the decorated Navy seal. 
 But it got me thinking, what have I actually achieved in my life, besides making jewelry for tourists? 
 You want me to write it for you? 
 Yes. Please. 
 Okay. 
 What I really want is a day at the beach. 
 No application, no blank computer screens, just a stress-free day and a couple of laughs. 
 And that's an order. 
 Oh! Oh, well, yes, ma'am. 
 Here you go. 
 Oh. Thank you, darling. 
 You know, I hate to say this, because I really love Seth, but those two look like a good fit. 
 Bob : Mm. They do seem good together. 
 Oh! I'm going to be late. 
 Late? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Where are you going? 
 Book club. 
 Twice in one month? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What are you girls reading? 
 Magazines or books? 
 I can't tell you that. 
 What happens in book club stays in book club, Bob Beldon. 
 Oh... 
 See you later. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Olivia : Can we have two iced teas, please? 
 I'm not used to being summoned on my personal time. 
 You weren't summoned. You were invited. 
 I feel summoned. 
 Look. Cedar Cove is a very small town. 
 I've noticed. 
 I'm not saying that we need to be best friends, I just think that we should be cordial and try to find some common ground. 
 Don't you think? 
 Okay. 
 Um, what's good here? 
 The crab salad. 
 I'll try that. 
 See? Common ground already. 
 You're gonna base our relationship on shellfish and mayo? 
 It's a start. 
 We have something else in common. 
 You went to Yale, right? 
 You went to Yale too? 
 Yes! 
 In fact, I graduated with someone you must know quite well. 
 Professor Malloy. 
 Contracts law? 
 I didn't have him. 
 Patricia Malloy. 
 Her. 
 Okay. I didn't have her. 
 Tell me, how's the brunch? 
 It's good. 
 So... 
 If you didn't have Patricia for contracts, who did you have? 
 You know... 
 Yale wasn't the happiest time of my life. 
 I'd rather not talk about it. 
 Okay. 
 Good. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 No, no. That's not a problem. 
 [Laughs] 
 Well, that's very kind of you. Thank you. 
 Yeah. All right. I'll see you in a couple of hours. 
 All right. Bye-bye. 
 You want to grab something at Moon's? 
 Peggy's at her book club. 
 What're they reading this month? 
 Ah, probably some paperback where a guy with long hair and no shirt rides a white horse. 
 [Chuckling] 
 So, Moon's? 
 No. I'm afraid I can't today. 
 That was the, uh, Seattle courier. 
 Somebody gave them my article on Luke, and the editor was gushing all over it, and wants to meet me. 
 Yeah. I read it online this morning. 
 Seriously, Jack, it's... it's very good. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Listen, I've got to race home and get ready if I'm gonna catch that ferry on time. 
 Maybe a raincheck? 
 Yeah. No problem. 
 Okay. 
 I'd prefer that Bob doesn't know anything about this, okay, Roy? 
 Complete client confidentiality. 
 Okay. 
 What's up? 
 [Peggy sighs] 
 Someone's been sending me flowers. 
 I called the florist and got nowhere. 
 Are there threats? 
 All the notes are blank. 
 And they're not signed. 
 Do you have any idea who it might be? 
 I pray to God I'm wrong. 
 But... 
 So you think this is the man? 
 Colin McFadden? 
 I'm afraid so. 
 Afraid? 
 Afraid that Bob's gonna find out something that I've kept hidden for years. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Huh. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [Grace, in the distance]: Good morning. 
 Grace. Hi. 
 I heard you left. 
 Yeah, well, I'm on a flight later. 
 Ah! Well, you have yourself a safe trip. 
 See you. 
 Grace, stop. 
 Are we gonna talk about what happened yesterday? 
 Please, just leave. 
 Not until we talk. 
 Well, I'm late for work, so I'm afraid we can't talk. 
 Later. Moon's? 
 No. I think it's best we not be seen in public. 
 What changed since yesterday? 
 Look, I'll come to your house. 
 Come on! Just 10 minutes, and then I'm on a flight back to Atlanta. 
 Okay. Fine. 
 My house in a couple of hours. 
 Hey! 
 Morning, darling. 
 Cliff! 
 Hi. Hi! 
 Oh, I missed you so much, I came home a day early. 
 Oh! Oh, ho! 
 I got some good news. I could barely wait another day to tell you. 
 Great! 
 Well, where're you going? 
 Well, I'm heading inside so I can hear all this good news. 
 You are as jumpy as a Jack-rabbit. 
 I am? 
 Yeah. Is something wrong? 
 No! Absolutely not. No. 
 Well, then, please, let me tell you my good news. 
 Okay. Yes. 
 I miss you. 
 Why, that's very sweet, but we have not been apart very long. 
 No. I don't mean just the last couple of days. 
 Look, you decided not to move up to the cabin. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You have your work, I have mine, but we rarely get a chance to see each other anymore. 
 So I decided to hire someone to help out. 
 Yeah? 
 Alex, a friend of mine from the rodeo circuit. 
 We met yesterday at the Thoroughbred Convention. 
 But I thought you liked to work alone. 
 I do, but if that means not seeing you... 
 Somehow I thought you'd be happier about it. 
 I am. 
 I am. 
 It's just the ink is barely dry on my divorce, and I'm starting to feel like I'm almost married again. 
 I just... 
 I need some time to, I don't know, breathe? 
 Catch up? 
 I need us to just slow down a bit. 
 It's because I told you I loved you, isn't it? 
 No! 
 I mean, yes. 
 I was surprised, but... 
 I love you. 
 I really do. 
 I just need some... 
 Time. 
 Got it. 
 You need some time. 
 Do some breathing. 
 Really? 
 And once you're done breathing, I'll still be right here. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 So where are Justine and Luke? 
 Uh, they're on their way. 
 They had to pick up an extra propane tank. 
 Hey, have you given any more thought to Hawaii? 
 What? 
 We talked about this. 
 We can't afford a trip to Hawaii. 
 We have savings. 
 That's our baby fund. 
 Yeah, but, you know, we decided that we weren't gonna have a baby. 
 We didn't decide anything. 
 Do you think if you use up our baby money, I'll give up on having children? 
 You can't just make decisions without discussing them with me. 
 We're married! 
 We're supposed to be in this together. 
 But what we have, well, it doesn't feel like a marriage. 
 All I wanted to do was take you someplace special before I left. 
 [Frustrated sigh] 
 "Left"? 
 Where are you going? 
 Ian! 
 I re-upped. 
 I ship out in a couple weeks. 
 Don't you think you should have discussed it with me first? 
 Well, things were pretty tense. 
 I didn't want them to get worse, okay? 
 So I just... you're running away! 
 Call it like it is! Own it! 
 You know what? You don't tell me everything you do. 
 You went to that adoption agency without me. 
 You're right. I don't tell you everything. 
 That's wrong. 
 Yeah. It is. 
 Look, I should've... 
 I stopped taking the pill. 
 What... what do you mean, you stopped? 
 You're not taking birth control? 
 Guess I'm not the only one in this marriage who can keep secrets. 
 Cecilia! 
 Hey, guys! 
 Cecilia? 
 Hey. Where are you going? 
 Cecilia : Home. 
 I'm sorry, guys. I'll explain later, okay? 
 Hey, dad! 
 I'm so glad I caught you. 
 Hey, what's up? 
 Shelly called. 
 What? Is everybody okay? The baby? 
 Yeah, no, no, they're fine. 
 It's just... 
 What? 
 She wants to bring Adele and come for a visit. 
 Well, that's great! 
 [Stops chuckling] That's not great? 
 No. 
 Why is that not great? 
 Well... 
 [stammers and sighs] 
 Is this about Rebecca? 
 Yeah. 
 [Sighs] Eric. 
 All right. 
 It's decision time. 
 If you think you're serious about Rebecca, you need to tell Shelly. 
 Let her figure out if she still wants to come for a visit. 
 If you're not really serious about making it work with Shelly, then you need to tell her now. 
 You're always gonna be Adele's father, and don't let that fact override how you feel about either woman. 
 Bottom line is, you need to be honest. 
 With them, and yourself. 
 [Ship's horn bellows] 
 I need to catch this ferry. 
 If you wanna talk more, you just give me a call, all right? 
 Thanks. 
 [Knocking at door] 
 Come in. 
 [He chuckles] 
 Oh! Moon... 
 I told you. 
 I don't usually do delivery, but exceptions will be made for exceptional people. 
 Grilled cheese? 
 With tomato. 
 Aww. You shouldn't have. 
 Ah, well, the shop's not that busy, and I understand you have a lot on your hands. 
 Will. 
 That brother of yours... 
 I'm surprised you didn't order wine. 
 [Laughs] 
 So, who do you think's gonna hit him this time? 
 There's a line forming. 
 Mm! 
 Maybe he learned a lesson the last time he was here. 
 Or maybe he learned nothing and he's here to make the same mistakes with the same people, leaving you to clean up the mess once again? 
 The second one, I'm afraid. 
 Ooh. 
 [Knocking at door] 
 Hey! 
 Moon. 
 William. 
 Onward and upward. 
 [Laughs] 
 Excuse me. 
 What did I do? 
 He likes Grace and Cliff. 
 Well, so do I! 
 Well... Grace. 
 Will, what are you doing? 
 Grace came by my office this morning, beside herself. 
 I'm just visiting my hometown. 
 Don't play innocent with me. 
 I've known you your whole life. 
 I didn't do anything with Grace. 
 Not because you didn't want to! 
 Not true. 
 She's with Cliff. I get it. 
 That wouldn't stop you. 
 Last year, being married didn't stop you. 
 You did the most masterfully sneaky thing you could've done... you made a move on her without making a move! 
 What are you doing back in Cedar Cove? 
 I just felt like I needed to tell you face-to-face about my divorce. 
 Again, I remind you, I have known you your whole life, so drop the act! 
 You could have called, you could have e-mailed, but no, you decided to come here in the flesh. 
 But let's back up here a minute. 
 What were you doing getting back in touch with Grace in the first place? 
 It just happened. 
 Oh, nothing just happens with you. 
 You make things happen. Usually bad things! 
 So you're upset with me? 
 Disappointed? 
 Not yet. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means I'd like to believe you, but the greatest predictor of future behavior is past behavior. 
 What can I say to convince you? 
 Nothing. 
 Why does this always happen between us? 
 How is it that you always manage to make your mess spill over into my life, my friends, and then make me the bad guy? 
 [He sighs] 
 
 
 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Well, well. 
 Look who's in the big city. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I had a meeting. 
 Yeah? 
 The courier is interested  in maybe giving me a weekly column. 
 They liked an article I wrote on P.T.S.D. 
 So did I. 
 Yeah? You read it? 
 Yeah, it was great. 
 Well, thank you. 
 [Laughs] 
 What? What's so funny? 
 Well, how do you think  the courier got ahold of your article? 
 You think they troll the Cedar Cove chronicle You gave it to them? Read it this morning, shot it over to the editor. Why would you do that? So when do you start? Well, to be honest, it wasn't the best meeting. You know what? I'm happy in Cedar Cove. The chronicle, it's my baby. Barring the occasional request from the owner, I get to write the stories I want to tell how to tell them, no one interferes. So the lure of reaching millions of people is of no interest to you anymore? It's a rush, and you miss it. Come on, you can kid yourself all you want, but you know you want it. I think you owe me a drink for passing your work up the food chain. Jeri, I don't think that's a very good idea. Sure. Use me to get your work to the editor. Hey, I didn't use you. I didn't even ask you. Okay, now we are just splitting hairs, Jack. You owe me, big-time. Jeri. What? [She sighs] Look. When you get this job... and I did say when, not if... you and I are gonna be seeing a lot of each other. Yeah? We might as well get over this weird awkwardness now. I mean, we're both professionals. So, what do you say? Well, I suppose we could get something to eat. I could eat. Grace? I forgot I had something for you. I stopped at that farmer's market, you know, the one you really like, in, uh... [♪♪♪] Grace isn't here. But you are. Look, I can explain. I'll bet you can. You're real good at talking your way outta things. No. It's not what you think. Really? [♪♪♪] [Sighing] Hey. You... you didn't go to book club today. Excuse me? Yeah, I, uh... I saw you with Roy, out in the park? Oh! Yeah... I was picking up dessert for the ladies, and I ran into him. Bob... Really? Just what exactly did you think I was up to today with Roy? I bought cookies, and he walked me to my car. End of story. Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. Really? Because you look like someone just stole your puppy. Did someone steal your puppy? I... I can't see you anymore. Is this about Shelly? And Adele. Look, Rebecca... I really like you... we met, we hooked up, we had some fun, now the fun's over. I'm a big girl. So, you're... you're okay with this? Yeah. But you don't seem to be. I gotta go back to work. [♪♪♪] That is on the house. How come? From where I was standing, that looked a little rough. She probably did you a favor, breaking it off. You gotta think about Shelly and the baby. I broke up with her. Really? Yeah. Yeah, it was my idea. Not hers. Hmm. Well, you can have the cake anyway. And eat it, too. [Chuckling] Justine : Cecilia and Ian are at home. Luke : Yeah? Well, they've got a lot to talk about. After everything Ian went through to get a good job on the base, why would he re-up? Well, why would she go off the pill without telling him? I'm just saying, it's probably more complicated than we know. How long have you known? A while. He told me the day he did it. Asked me to keep it quiet. That's not really fair of him. Well, when a friend asks you to keep a secret, you keep it. I wanted to tell you. I hated not telling you. Actually, it was more difficult keeping it from you than keeping it from Cecilia. How's that? Just something about you. I just want to tell you everything. You want to tell me everything? Yeah, I do. Well, that's what friends do. Right. Friends. Because we are friends. Oh, good friends. I'm starving! Well, good thing I got the grill set up and ready to go. Good. Jack : Okay, here you go. Jeri : I think you're getting off pretty cheap, considering I single-handedly rebooted your career. Excuse me. If you look carefully, you will notice this is a chili dog. Well, I stand corrected, Mr. big spender. Cafe mocha, no sugar, no whipped cream. Extra-dry, half-skim, half-full milk. And I thought you were just a Cedar Cove legend. [Chuckles] Um... Sorry. Do I know you? No. But I've spent many a wasted hour behind your ridiculous and inane coffee order. My apologies. Watch and see how it's done. Coffee. Black. Don't you have an assistant to fetch your brew? Yes. Actually, I do. I sent him to a job site. So this must be my lucky day. That line is as old as my Nana. Actually, it's not really a line, I was... Correct. It's lame. Moon : One coffee. Black. Thank you. [Laughs] Rebecca Jennings. Our new A.D.A. You spend so much time in court, I'm surprised you haven't run into her yet. Oh, that's very funny, Moon. It's only funny 'cause it's true. Single? Uh, yes, I am, but I'm always looking. Oh. Her. Mm. Recently broke up. And good luck to ya. Luck is not a factor. This is fun. What? Can we do this? What are we doing? This. You know? Being part of each other's lives again? I can do it. Can you? [Laughs] Oh, there's a lot of history between us. Not all bad. We were friends longer than we were husband and wife. Our marriage was performed by Elvis and lasted 48 hours. We were never "husband and wife." True. Can I trust you? Whatever do you mean, Mr. Griffith? I'm not kidding. The vodka, talking to Olivia. I'm kind of worried about what you have planned for an encore. The vodka was a cheap shot. So was talking to Olivia. Friends? Jack. Yeah. Friends. What do we have to lose, right? [♪♪♪] I let myself in with your spare key. That key... Is for emergencies, and it's not for you to just let yourself in. Sorry. Look, will. You are barely divorced, and I'm in a relationship, and it's not just about me. I have to consider more than just my feelings. I totally agree. Oh, you do? I'm heading back to Atlanta. You're overwhelmed, and so am I. Wow. What? Well, I just didn't expect you to be so... Decent? Yeah. You're a new will, that's for sure. I should, uh, tell you... Cliff dropped by earlier today. [Sighing] I'm pretty happy with how fast you've been learning the business. Thank you. Warren : I'm also constantly amazed at how brilliant I am at spotting good people. And I have to say, I appreciate your loyalty and your discretion in, you know, certain matters. Sure. So, that being said, I'm going to throw another responsibility on your plate. Think you can handle that? Absolutely. From now on, I'm giving you authority to sign checks and invoices. Why? You know, when someone offers somebody a promotion, Eric, it's kind of bad form to ask why. No, I mean, why do you need someone else to sign your checks? Because I'm out of the office a lot. I travel. Remember last week? The supply house? They wanted to get paid, right? What happened? I wasn't here. When a developer doesn't pay on time, Eric, it, uh, it's the kiss of death in this business. So, if I'm unavailable, you can take care of it. You can handle this, right? Yeah. I think so. You think so, or you know so? I know so. Good. You can leave now. [♪♪♪] So it's come to this? I can't stay here. Fine. You stay, I'll leave. You've got to start packing. You're shipping out soon. This isn't about babies anymore. Then what is it about? Our marriage. It feels like it's in a free fall. It feels like we're never gonna get back to where we were before. [Exhales wearily] What? I don't think we're gonna make it. [Phone ringing] Hello? So, how was it? Uh, I don't think I should be expecting a call any time soon. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm, uh... a little... Disappointed? No. Angry. I could write circles around most of their reporters, but, uh, since I'm no longer  Jack Griffith from the Philadelphia beacon,  and I'm just good old Jack Griffith  from the Cedar Cove chronicle,  they won't even give me a chance. Well, until they call, it's not over. Well, they haven't called, so it is over. Anyway. Tell me about your day. Good or bad? Long. And a little upsetting. I found out that Rebecca lied on her resume and job application. How? Olivia : Oh, I followed a hunch and called a friend of mine who teaches at Yale,  and she checked with the registrar's office, and Rebecca Jennings never went to Yale. Hmph. Well, I can't say that I'm surprised. What happens now? Well, if I tell the D.A., she'll be fired, sanctioned, disbarred, or all three. I'll tell you what. Why don't you come over here tonight? I'll order your favorite take-out. Just let me clean up a few things here, and I'll be right over. Okay. Bye-bye. [Sighs] [Lily Kershaw's "like the sun" plays] ♪ Don't hold me like I'm going ♪

Upset about something, but I don't know what. I am excited to work for him, though. I mean, the way he handles horses, a lot of guys go at it hard. Not Cliff. He's gentle. Like he's talking to them. He's about the most patient man I've ever met. Uh-huh! So when he offered me this job, I jumped at it. Uh-huh! The rodeo circuit's not that big, so we all eventually cross each other's paths. Uh-huh.

So if this school doesn't think that you'd be a great social worker, then that's their problem, and they don't deserve you. They want to know your greatest accomplishment? Tell them I am. Me, where I am right now, that's your accomplishment. And you staple my picture to your application. Because it scares me to think where I'd be right now if it wasn't for you. [♪♪♪] No. What? I'm sorry. I just can't. [♪♪♪] [Phone ringing] Rebecca? [Phone ringing continue] Warren : Hey, Rebecca! Thank you for meeting me here. I'm so sorry. I was just stuck on a very long, very boring conference call. So here's what I thought we'd do. Start out with a few drinks, and work our way through the night. What do you say? Sounds great. Rebecca Jennings. Eric. Nice to meet you. Ready? Mm-hmm. Fantastic. [♪♪♪] Absolutely. Yes. Yes. Not at all. No. Of course not. No. [Mouths "Seattle"] Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, thank you. All right. Bye-bye. [Beeps phone off] That was the editor of the Seattle courier. And? I start Monday! A column a week to run on Fridays! Oh! I am so happy for you, Jack. You deserve this. You do! [Sighs] What's the matter? In the, uh... Spirit of... Full disclosure in our relationship... yes. You know how I said I didn't know how they got ahold of my article? Well, I found out. Jeri gave it to them. Jeri? The ex-wife that sends you vodka? That jeri? You talked to her? Yes. Over hot dogs. Oh. You saw her? You just ran into each other? I am sure that she planned it. Oh. And what else did she plan? Oh, Olivia. I have no interest in her. Please, Jack. I'm not jealous. I'm concerned about you. She got me the job. No. You got yourself the job. I'm an excellent judge of character, and anyone that sends a recovering alcoholic a bottle of alcohol has no character. Do you really want to spend time with someone like that? There's nothing I can do about jeri. Okay? She works at the paper. So unfortunately, from time to time, I'm gonna run into her, like I did today. Okay? It's no big deal. Jack... You know what? I can handle it. All right? The job, jeri... all of it. I swear. [♪♪♪]
