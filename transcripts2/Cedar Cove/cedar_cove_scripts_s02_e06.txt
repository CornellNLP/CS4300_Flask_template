 Previously on Cedar Cove... 
 Justine : Do you like it here? 
 In Cedar Cove? 
 Yeah. It's nice. Good. I'm gonna find something. I promise you. This whole thing would've been taken care of differently. Jack : You're working for Warren Saget! Jack. Dad! Luke! [♪♪♪] You skyping Seth? No. Just catching up on the news. Breakfast? I already ate. Coffee? Made a fresh pot. Wow! You're a great roommate. Thanks. I gotta go. Justine? Is everything alright? Sure. Fine. I'm good. Bye. [Grace laughing] Cliff! What are you up to? Just a little bit more. Cliff... Alright. Open your eyes. It's the cabin on your ranch. Okay. I'm really confused. You're selling your house. Yeah. Well, my renters moved out a couple of months ago, and I haven't had time to find new ones. Yeah... You can be my new tenant! What do you say? [♪♪♪] You off to work? Yeah. Look. I didn't tell you I took the job with Warren, 'cause I know you don't like him. That's not true! Okay, that's true. I think the whole town knows how you feel about him now, thanks to your article. Hey, the chronicle is no different than the New York times... "all the news that's fit to print." Dad... This is a good job and a great opportunity, but something tells me any more articles on Warren, like the last one, and I won't have my good job much longer. Could you just be happy for me? I am. I wish I could believe you. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Do you want to talk about it? Oh... It's Eric. Oh. I thought you two were in a good place? We are. Or we were, then he started working for Warren Saget. So you've been...? [Chuckles quietly] Telling him exactly how I feel. Which is...? Not making him too happy with me. Sometimes, children do the opposite of what their parents tell them to do, especially adult children. I hate to see you ruin everything that you've worked so hard to achieve with Eric. And I certainly don't want to see you push him closer to Warren! [Sighs heavily] [Phones ringing] Right over there. Luke? What are you doing here? Uh, I'll be right outside. Right outside. Are you okay? I've got to get you out of here. No. Can't hurt you or anyone else if I'm locked up. You lost your temper. It happens, especially after everything that you've been through. You should leave. Let me at least find you a lawyer, or call someone. No. Go. Luke. Look. The safest place for you is far away from me. So please, just go. I really don't know what I'm capable of. Sheriff! She's done! Alright? Come on. You know, it's none of my business, but maybe you should listen to him. Stay away, Justine. You're not gonna stay away, are you? No. And you're not gonna tell my mom about any of this, because she will totally freak out. Well, she is the judge, and he is in jail. She's gonna find out soon enough. Please? [Grumbles] Well... Goes against my better judgment, but... Thanks, Troy. I've had the same bait-and-tackle shop on main street since... well, forever. My dad owned it, and my granddad before him. This I know. And now, thanks to the mayor and Warren Saget, for the first time in 50 years, I have to pay to park in front of my own store! The mayor is in Warren Saget's back pocket, any new development, and he just rubber-stamps it, and boom! Another Saget house or condo or townhouse. This is Cedar Cove, not New York City! Focus, Mr. Barnes. 30 unpaid parking tickets. With more development, the more people go through the city, and the more meters they put up to make money off of the people! Sit down, Mr. Barnes. For the record, although it is true that the installation of parking meters is under the mayor's purview, unpaid parking tickets, well, that's in my court. I won't pay. Well, then your car will continue to be ticketed, day after day, and sooner or later, it's going to be towed, and then next month, you'll be back in here, but the price will have doubled, or tripled, what with fines, storage, Towage... But, under the special circumstances, your clean record, and your family's contribution to our town and main street, what would you say if I spoke to the mayor and asked him to consider removing the meter in front of your store, provided you replace it with, I don't know... A nice wooded bench? You would say... "Thank you, Judge Lockhart." Thank you, Judge Lockhart. You're welcome, Mr. Barnes. Court will take a short recess. Grace! Cliff just offered me the cabin on his property. Oh! Yeah. "Oh!" It's a cabin. Well, it's quite lovely on the outside. What's it like on the inside? I have no idea. I didn't go inside. You do know that that is literally the definition of prejudice? You just don't get it. Apparently not. Has Jack never given you a gift you just didn't like? Yes. It was last Christmas. It was flannel. You hated it! Yes. But you lied and said you loved it? Of course. I didn't want to hurt his feelings. Well, this is one big, ugly flannel thing that I will have to wear every day. Do you want to know what I think? No. I think you won't even go inside that cabin because then you'll have no excuses left. You'll either have to move, or admit that selling the house was the easy part... leaving it's the hard part. It is an ugly flannel shirt. Plain and simple. If you say so. [Fumes] Oh! What? I hate when you do that. Do what? Know me so well. Sorry. Are you really? No. [Scoffs] [Machinery chugging] Eric : You know, this is pretty amazing. Yeah, well, for what it's costing me and my partners back east, it should be. You have partners? 'Course I have partners, Eric. They're watching the clock and the money. Now, listen. We've got a pretty good crew here, but, unfortunately, they're three days behind, and my partners do not like to lose money, and neither do I. Now, all this week, I've got meetings with the city council and the mayor about my next project, but what I need is, is I need you to be here, I need you to be kicking their lazy butts. I need you to be me. I need you to stay on top of them, okay? Lunch and breaks, keep 'em short. Get 'em back to work. The most important thing... we've got three days to make up here, Eric. You can handle that, right? Absolutely. Good. [Exhales tensely] [Car door shuts] Hey, Justine. Peggy! Yeah? Have you seen Luke? He didn't come home last night. He's in jail. He got arrested? Some guy tried to pick a fight with Luke. Actually, Luke picked a fight with him. I was there. Well, is he okay? Are you? I'm fine, but Luke's refusing to leave jail, and there's something wrong with him. I don't know what it is, but he needs help. Yeah. What? We think he might have P.T.S.D. Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder? Mm-hmm. That's right. I mean, he's only been here for a few days, but from what we've seen, he seems to have a lot of the symptoms. Peggy : We can tell he's just really hurting. Yeah. These days, so many of the soldiers are coming home with some form of it. We've both tried to talk to him and... he just shuts down. But how can you be sure? Unfortunately, uh... I know it when I see it. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Phone rings] Sheriff's office. Troy? Oh! Hey, Jack. How you doing? Looking at the daily crime blotter here... Yeah? Luke Bailey was arrested for assault last night? Yes. He was. This the same Luke Bailey who Justine's been hanging around with? The ex-Navy seal? Yeah, that's him. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Alright, this is my favorite. Peanut butter, banana and Mayo. Ugh! Well, for the lady... We have turkey, brie, with caramelized onion on a baguette. Moon's? Jack's. Oh. You know, there is this room between the dining room and the front door. It's called a "kitchen." It's where sandwiches come from. And we've had this discussion. You are not with me for my cooking. No, I'm not. Wow! Brown-bagging it, huh? You are really living the dream. Yeah, I just came from a city council meeting. Does that mean we can expect to see more shoddy Saget construction in Cedar Cove? Well, what can I say, Jack? I have a drive to succeed, and I like to eat my lunch off a plate. Call me crazy. Oh, I could call you a lot more than that. Jack. Yes. Down, boy. Oh, by the way, I'm sure you'll be happy to know this... that Eric is doing great. It's nice to see that he's not a chip off the old block. You know, he's gonna go far in my company, Jack. I'm gonna see to that. Hello, Olivia. Oh. I can't stand that guy. But you hide it so well. [Laughs] Oh, hey. It's crazy about Luke, huh? Justine must have told you? She didn't tell you? Well, he was in my court today, for assault. Did Justine tell you? No. I read it on the crime blotter. It's pretty serious. He refused to have an attorney. It seems like he just wants to stay in jail. I mean, what does Justine have to do with this? Well, she was with him. [♪♪♪] [Lively banter among workers] Oh, man alive. Man : So we were lifting up, about five feet off the ground. Sure enough, the strap breaks. Hits me back. I go back... [Overlapping banter continues] These guys going around, and then... of course, the one guy, who turns to me and says... big guy, 300 pounds, I'm looking up at him... Excuse me. Gotta be 6'5" or something... Excuse me! I'm Eric. Mr. Saget's associate. Well, that's your problem. [All chortling] Actually, my problem is that you should be in the middle of framing, not doing stand-up. Really? You're three days behind. Okay. Mr. Saget put me in charge. So tell me something. Eric. Eric... Do you feel like you're in charge? [Guys snickering] Ian's gonna meet us. I don't know what to do. He will. I hope so. How is Luke? Bob tried talking to him, but no luck. He doesn't want to take help from anyone. Ian will be able to do something. Why don't I get us a couple coffees? Latte? Extra foam? You remembered. You can take the girl out of Moon's, but... I'll stick with water. I'm staying away from caffeine. Really? I really want to get pregnant again, so caffeine's a no-no. That's great. But last time we talked, you said Ian wasn't ready. He's not. It's gonna be kind of hard to do without him. I know. I miss our baby, too, but I want to get on with our lives. I can't believe he hasn't taken the hint. Every movie I download has something to do with babies, or parenting, or both. I keep volunteering to babysit for our friends with kids, and we've had ice cream, beans, and some form of salmon daily. Not together. Foods that help you get pregnant. I'm pretty sure it takes more than ice cream. Why don't you just talk to Ian? What if he says he doesn't want to have children? What do I do then? Ian. Justine. Hey. So, what's up? Luke is in jail. He's in jail? So this is new. It's curried veggie paella. What's in it? Everything in the pantry I don't want to pack, and eggs. [Laughing] It's good. Well, not... not that good. [Laughs]: Oh, great. So, are we gonna talk about it? What? You don't like the cabin? Eh... Even without going inside? Don't need to. You can't judge a book by its cover, Grace. I am a librarian and I can tell you that that statement actually isn't always true. Honey, look at me. Even my sneakers have heels! I don't do cabins. This is why you don't spend the night at my ranch. No. I like your ranch, it's just, you know, it's... It's very animally. And why, in heaven's name, do you have boots nailed to the wall? Hey. It's a fair question. More paella? No. I'm done. With dinner? Cliff? With me? Goodnight, Grace. And for your information, those boots, nailed to the wall, are all from rodeo competitions I won. I like those boots. [♪♪♪] I used my key! It wasn't locked. I still wanted to use my key! You haven't heard from Justine yet, have you? No, and I've been leaving her messages all day, and she doesn't call me back. The pizza smells amazing! Is it from the new place in town? I hear that guy's from Brooklyn. What? I have been calling you all day. My cell phone's dead and I lost my charger. What's going on? How's your friend, Luke? 
 
 [♪♪♪] I can't believe that Troy told you. He promised. It wasn't Troy. It was me. Mom, just because I'm living with you now does not mean you get to know everything that's going on in my life. This isn't a privacy issue. You could have been hurt. This is why I didn't want you to know. I knew that you would overreact. Bob thinks that Luke has P.T.S.D. Well, that would explain a lot. None of this is Luke's fault. You can't send him to prison. You have to do something. Please. He's a defendant in my court. I have to remain impartial. There has got to be something that you can do. Hmph. There is a judge I know in Cooperton who's doing something new, it's called "veterans' court." The goal is to rehabilitate, not punish. As long as Luke went to treatment... his record will remain clean and he'll get the help he needs. Well, can you do that here? Given Cedar Cove's proximity to the naval base, and the fact that I've been seeing so many vets lately... I think it's time. So how do we do it? Well, he'll need a lawyer to argue that his case should be moved to vet court, and I've got a friend that likes to take on an occasional pro Bono case, when it's for a good cause. Well, Luke is a good cause. A really good cause. [♪♪♪] Hey, Eric! Hey. Whoa. I haven't seen you looking this low, since two tables stiffed you and that Baxter kid threw up on your shoes twice. That was a stellar day compared to the week I'm having. Nothing wrong with Shelly, I hope? No, Shelly's fine. So's Adele. Warren is gonna fire me. Ooh. What did you do? I couldn't do what he asked me to do. I mean, at this job site, this foreman, he's a jerk, but I'm a jerk for letting him get the better of me. "To conquer oneself" "is a greater task than conquering others." Buddha. He was one righteous dude. The rough translation... you've got to believe in yourself before others will believe in you. And for the record... "If no one dies, that is a cheap life lesson." Buddha? No. Lauren dunne. My mom. She was also quite righteous. I'll get you a coffee. Thanks. Tell me what's going on in that head of yours, Bob Beldon. [Sniffles then sighs] [♪♪♪] Luke is not David. You gotta admit Luke acts a lot like him. David killed himself because he thought that was the only way to find peace after what he'd been through in Vietnam. And he was wrong. And I should have saved him! No! You can't think like that. Honey, no matter how much you care about a person, you can't save them. You can help... But they have to want to save themselves. Luke is not David. And it's not too late for him. And what should I do? Hmm? Well, first, I'm gonna go get those guests taken care of, and then we are going to see if we can't get Luke to listen to reason. [Chuckles warmly] Oh, Peggy. [♪♪♪] Hey! Hey! Oh... Now, you see, I was gonna do that, but then... eh. I decided to do this. And I had to run an extra mile because of the pizza last night. Ahh. Well, I have a high metabolism. Me, sitting here like this, I'm burning, like, 500 calories. [Sighs] Jack. Yes? I love seeing you over here, but you have got to quit avoiding Eric. You need to talk to him. Aren't you running late for court? Quit avoiding the subject. And the subject is? You hiding out here to avoid Eric. [Sighing] He thinks I want him to fail at his new job. And don't you? Just a little bit? Well, I'm not rooting for him to get fired, no. But I won't lie. I wouldn't be that sad if he were no longer working for Warren. See, to Eric, he can't see the fine distinction of your point of view. All he sees and feels is that you're not on his side. When Justine was dating Warren, and I would see them together, I would get absolutely and utterly apoplectic. And I took every chance I could to run him down. And you know what happened? It just pulled her in, closer to Warren. It wasn't until I able to take a step back and keep my opinions to myself, that she finally saw the truth and dumped him. So your solution was to do nothing? Not exactly. Even though I was against the relationship, I made sure that she knew I was there for her... Unconditionally. Support Eric, and trust that, eventually, he's gonna figure things out just like Justine did. Hmm. Hey there. I need to talk to Luke. Oh, he's gone. Gone? Yeah. He got bailed out an hour ago. But he refused bail. Well, maybe he changed his mind. Or Ian changed it for him. Ian Rendall bailed him out? Yes, he did. Troy, you don't think that he would leave town before his court appearance, do you? I don't know. I told him not to. What happens if he doesn't show up for court? Then your mother will be forced to issue a bench warrant for his arrest. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Where have you been? Is Luke with you? No. Well, where is he? We know you bailed him out. Yeah. I did. What's the big deal? Where is he, then? He said he was going back to the thyme and tide. He's getting his stuff and then he's taking off. Ian, no. If he does, my mom's gonna have to issue some kind of warrant for his arrest. There's not gonna be a trial. I'll talk to the guy Luke hit. He'll drop the charges. The state is bringing charges. The only one who can drop the charges against Luke is the district attorney. I gotta find him before it's too late. We'll stay here in case he comes back or calls. [Door shuts, Ian sighs] Man, he's in some real trouble, isn't he? Hey... It's gonna be okay. Is it? Yeah. I'm not so sure. Are we still talking about Luke? I'm worried about us. Us? [Sighs] Never mind. This isn't the time. I'll make it the time. What's going on, Cecilia? I want to have children. We're going to have children. When we're ready. But I'm ready now. I, uh... I just don't want to put you through that again so soon. I want to put me through it. It's a risk. Everything good in life is. You know what? Um... Maybe you're right. Maybe this isn't the time to talk about this. So when is the right time to talk about something you clearly don't want to talk about? You're scared. I get that. To be honest, I am, too. But I'm not so scared, that I don't want to try to have another baby. Just because we lost our baby girl... wait. You're not...? Pregnant? No. Would it really be so bad if I was? You took a job at the base so that we could have a normal family life. Well, for me, normal "family" includes family, which means children. We are a family. I know... And I love you. Wait. Are you saying you don't ever want to have children? I'm saying... I'm saying that I think I should go help look for Luke. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Hey. Justine. We're heading over to talk to Luke. He's not here? Honey, he's in jail. Not anymore. Foreman Tyler : Sprays over everything, right? It's caked on the doors, the windows... You name it, it's there, and it stinks! It's terrible. Lunch ended 30 minutes ago! Well, look who's back for more. That framing needs to be finished today or we're gonna be another half-day behind! Ah, says who? Me. Because I'm in charge. I work with Mr. Saget. You all work for him, and me. From now on, there will be no more extended lunches, no more delays, and no more excuses. We're gonna make up for those lost days. Is that clear? Pfft. I said, is that clear? Why should we listen to some kid? Because he represents me. And when you disrespect my representative, you disrespect me. Got it? I'm impressed, Eric. You stood your ground. [Eric chuckles in relief] I know that's not an easy thing to do. And to be honest, I did throw you into the deep water to see if you could swim. Turns out you can... and you did. Nice job, kid. [Door creaks] And it all works. In case you were wondering. You caught me. Just saw the ad in the paper, and thought I'd come and check it out for myself before you rented it. I didn't have time to nail cowboy boots to the wall yet. Are we still fighting? I think so. I don't want to fight anymore. Me neither. [Grace sighs] I am so sorry for all those things I said about your ranch. I have to tell you... I just said I was sorry! Will you let me finish? My ex-wife never told me how she really felt about anything. So you like that I told you how I felt? Yeah, I guess I do. Can I tell you something else? I don't want to live here. It's not me. Well... it's here if you ever do want it. [♪♪♪] Did you find him? No. Bob's still out looking for him, even though he thinks he's gone. What have I done? He's gonna end up in so much trouble, legal trouble, and it's my fault. [Scoffs] Justine. It's true. It's not your fault! You helped Luke. Yeah. I helped him straight into jail. Honey... You did the right thing. Why do I feel so bad? Aww. [♪♪♪] Luke! Where do you think you're going, son? You can't leave. You've got charges against you. Oh, I've got to get out of here. It's going to be no different in Seattle, or Salem, or California... wherever you end up. Except, if you leave without going to court and straightening out this mess you got yourself in, yeah, then it will be different. You'll be a fugitive, then you'll really have something to run from. I'm not crazy. No. No, you're just a guy who has been through some pretty horrific stuff. Your brain needs help sorting it all out. I used to be you. I came home to cedar cove a changed young man. [Bob sighs] I didn't want help either. So, uh, I got lost in a different way. And I am living proof that you can survive this and come out better on the other side. Me, Justine, Ian, Cecilia, Judge Lockhart, we're all trying to do everything we can for you, but until you actually ask for, and get the help you need, it won't work. I am tired of running. Then stop. Stay here. [♪♪♪] [Sobs quietly] [Door opens] Hey! Good day? No. It was a freaking awesome day. [Both chuckling] Listen. I owe you an apology. You working for Warren Saget is not my favorite thing. This is an apology? Warren and I have a history. I can't deny that. I don't like him. I can't deny that either. But it is you who is working for him, and you like him, and, frankly, he's treating you well, so, I am sorry if... My issues have clouded over your excitement for landing this job. Hey. I am now, and always will be, there for you and to support you in whatever you do. I'm your dad. Apology accepted. So Luke's going to the base with Bob and Ian. He's going to be evaluated by the head of psychiatric services. Everything worked out! You found him. It was Bob. No, it wasn't just Bob. You did a good thing, Justine. You helped him with the letter, you got everyone involved, and you were someone for him to talk to. Luke would not be getting help with his P.T.S.D. if it wasn't for you. His life is gonna be better because he met you. And you did it all because that's who you are. Yeah. Well, I'm my mother's daughter. Thank you. Any time, sweet-pea. [♪♪♪] Ian : Cecilia! Hello? Hey. Hey. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah. Luke's a bit shook-up, but he's gonna get the help he needs. Good. I'm glad. Listen, um... About earlier. I'm sorry, I love you, but I'm just... I'm not ready to have kids. Is that okay? Are we okay? We're fine. Just fine. I love you. I love you, too. Dinner? Sure. Just give me a minute. [♪♪♪] Hey. Going my way? [Both chuckling] So... this stunningly beautiful, very smart woman gave me some good advice, and I took it. Stunningly beautiful? Yeah. Want to meet her? We have a date later. Which I have to cancel. I'm sorry. Do I need to worry? I'm just going to Grace's. I'll call you later. Mm. [Grace laughs] Hi! Hi. I am here to pack, drink, reminisce, and cry, not necessarily in that order. I felt it was a two-bottle situation. Oh, my. And... I brought some lovely hors d'oeuvres. Oh, honey, I'm not hungry. It's that triple-creme you love. Well, you know, I might be able to force down a wedge. [Both chuckling] Thought you had a date with Jack tonight. I canceled it. You're a good friend. Right back at ya. So what do you want to do first? [Voice breaks]: Cry. And drink. Yeah! To new beginnings. [Clink] ♪ I knew it right from the start ♪
