 Woman :  X-ray tech to radiology. 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 X-ray tech to radiology. 
 [Sighs] [Woman coughs] 
 I'm afraid he didn't make it. 
 Of course. 
 Anyone I ever get close to... 
 It might comfort you to know that he died in a tremendous amount of pain. 
 How would that comfort me? 
 I said it  might. 
 But... he lived a long life, had 15 grandchildren, fought bravely with the all-black brigade in Italy... 
 Are you talking about Detective Jay Geils? 
 No, this is Vernon George Abernathy. 
 Oh, my god. Have I done it again? 
 Aren't you his wife, Corrine Abernathy? 
 No, I'm Detective Angie Tribeca. 
 Oh. [Both laugh] 
 [Both sigh] 
 I wish I could tell you this was the first time this has happened. 
 Geils is fine. He's right over there. 
 Oh! [Both laugh] 
 What's so funny? 
 Oh, he told me you were dead. 
 Ohh. Oh, my god. That's hilarious. 
 Can you imagine? 
 Yes. 
 So, he should stay off it for a while. 
 Little ice, little heat. He'll be fine. 
 Welcome back, partner. 
 Let me buy you a cup of coffee. 
 Thanks, Doc. 
 Yeah. Thanks, Doc. 
 Anytime. 
 [Beep]

 [Officer Dave screaming] 
 [Screaming continues] 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 He's back! 
 Ah! Ha ha! Ha! Geils! 
 Hey! Geils is back! Welcome back! 
 Hey. Whoo! 
 How you been? Bring it in. Come here. 
 Aah! God. What's up with these g... 
 Ugh! Ohh! 
 [Grunts] 
 Aah! 
 How you doin'? 
 Tanner, Hoffman. 
 Tribeca, coffees. 
 O-oh, no, I had the latte. 
 Oh. 
 Thank you. 
 [Slurps] There he is! 
 The big man, the man with the plan, Detective All-That! 
 I forgot his name. 
 Geils. 
 Geils! 
 Tanner, Hoffman. 
 We missed you, buddy. Welcome back. 
 Oh, and by the way, uh, lieutenant wants to see you. 
 Ugh. What kind of mood's he in today? 
 Tribeca, get the hell in here! 
 Pretty good. Hmm. 
 Yeah, it's possible. 
 [Receiver clicks] 
 Geils, what the hell are you doing back here? 
 I thought the hospital said it was a bad sprain? 
 Some sprains are worse than others, I guess. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 You wanted to see us? 
 Another baker killed himself. 
 Damn it! 
 That's the third one this month. 
 How old? 
 I'm 56. 
 You look great. 
 What? This old thing? 
 I'm thinking you want us to look into the baker. 
 No! Leave that to the coroner. 
 You two just figure out why he's dead. 
 Geils, you sure that knee's okay? 
 Ready for action. [Cranking] 
 I'm really glad we get to be partners again. don't get all squishy on me. 
 Doesn't mean we're gonna be best friends forever. 
 I know. 
 [Clattering] 
 Boy, you don't let anybody in, do you? 
 I have my reasons. 
 Which you're not about to tell me. 
 Let's just say, I was engaged to my first partner, and he vanished under mysterious circumstances. 
 Both : I was engaged to my first partner, and he vanished under mysterious circumstances. 
 It's okay. I don't want to know. 
 You just don't let up, do you? 
 No, I don't want to hear it. Fine. I'll tell you. 
 It was meant to be the happiest day of my life. 
 ♪ 
 Officer Tribeca? 
 Yes, Sergeant Pepper? 
 I have some bad news. 
 You're under arrest... 
 For stealing my heart. 
 Aww. 
 You have the right to remain beautiful. 
 Anything you say will only make me fall more in love with you. 
 What are you doing? Are you cuffing my finger? 
 That's a ring. Will you marry me? 
 Oh, my god. Yes! 
 I love you so much. 
 I love you, too. 
 Are you gonna be comfortable with swinging? 
 Of course.

 [Siren chirps] 
 ♪ 
 Thank you. 
 What are we looking at, Dr. Scholls? 
 [Gags] 
 The deceased's name is Franz Schubert, and he owned the place. 
 That makes a dozen of these baker suicides this year. 
 So, 13? Mm. 
 What's Schubert's story? 
 Any tension at home? Debts? 
 That's the curious thing. We checked his books. 
 He's flush... made $2 million last year. 
 Who was the last person to see Schubert alive? 
 A wedding planner picked up a wedding cake this morning. 
 For a wedding, I'm guessing. 
 Wedding. 
 Hey, are you all right? 
 Let's just say, I get a little twitchy when it comes to weddings. 
 All : I get a little twitchy when it comes to weddings. 
 Why don't I interview the wedding planner? 
 Would you mind? 
 Not at all. I love you. 
 What was that? 
 I just said I'll interview the wedding planner. 
 I want to have babies with you. 
 ♪ 
 Good. You're here. This is all wrong. 
 Pull up this floor, change out the chandelier. 
 And for god's sake, tear down the drapery. 
 It looks like an orphanage. 
 I'll get on it right away. 
 Wait a minute. I'm a detective. 
 I have to ask you... 
 Hey, are you celebrity wedding planner Jean Naté? 
 I read about you in the hospital. 
 I wasn't in the hospital. 
 I  was in the hospital. It was in a magazine. 
 The hospital was in a magazine? 
 Yeah, Ryan Seacrest had his 40th birthday there. 
 You picked up a cake from the Franz Schubert bakery this morning. 
 Did you notice anything unusual? 
 Like that Franz was dead? 
 The last time I saw Franz, he was in perfect health and high spirits. 
 I have no idea why he put an icing bag in his mouth. 
 How do you know he did it with an icing bag? 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 I'm sorry, Detective. I have to take this. 
 ♪ 
 It's the baker. 
 He's almost done. 
 So, what did you come up with? 
 This was no suicide. 
 Good afternoon, Dr. Edelweiss. 
 ♪ 
 [Thump] 
 [Coughs] Ah. 
 Tribeca, Geils. 
 No, the icing didn't kill him. 
 But let's turn him over. 
 I want to show you something very interesting. 
 Now, you see these holes? 
 I'm thinking someone fired a gun into them. 
 Gun holes. 
 So much for the suicide theory. 
 I mean, this case is so weird. 
 It just keeps changing and changing and changing. 
 One minute, it's one thing. 
 And then the next minute, it's another thing. 
 God, this cake is so good. 
 He was such a good baker. I'm so sad he's dead. 
 Do you think he's ever gonna make more cake? 
 What the hell is wrong with you, Geils? 
 You're wired. 
 Freeze! 
 Nobody move. 
 ♪ 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 ♪ 
 Now, if my suspicions are correct... 
 Oh, unfreeze, everyone. 
 All we need to do is to heat this up to 400 degrees. 
 Here, hold that a moment, would you? 
 ♪ 
 Careful. 
 [Microwave whirring] 
 Yes, I saw this scheme once in Belgium but with chocolate. 
 They reduce the ingredients... The sugar and the flour... 
 And, through the heat, turn it into one piece of pure, unadulterated... 
 [Microwave beeps] 
 Oh. 
 
 
 
 ♪ 
 Drugs. 
 So, the baker was distributing drugs by baking them into wedding cakes. 
 But something tells me he wasn't the mastermind. 
 Well, wasn't the last person to see the baker alive a wedding planner? 
 Yes, Jean Naté. 
 Geils talked to her. Think they're connected? 
 No, they're not connected. 
 If they were, Ms. Naté would be lying there. 
 On the table next to the baker. 
 No, these are two entirely separate human beings. 
 If we figure out where the drugs are coming from, maybe that'll lead us to our killer. 
 Well, we did find something odd when going through the baker's records. 
 There was a "Simon & Garfunkel Greatest Hits" stuck in the middle of the hard-rock section between Led Zeppelin and Night Ranger. 
 That's a head-scratcher. Maybe there's a folk-rock angle? 
 That's what we thought at first, until we found this delivery receipt hidden inside the album cover. 
 20 pounds of flour for $250,000? 
 That can't be right. 
 It's from a place called Tom's Flour. 
 I think it's time to pay a visit to this... 
 [Dramatic beat] 
 Tom. 
 [Dramatic beat] 
 ♪ 
 Looks like they were tipped off. 
 Excuse me. 
 Is this Tom's Flour? 
 It was until yesterday. 
 Then they suddenly packed up and shut the whole operation down. 
 You ever seen this woman? 
 It's hard to say. 
 Give it a shot, smart guy. 
 No, I mean it's hard to say her name. 
 Jean... No-tay. 
 She's a wedding planner, right? 
 Yeah, she used to come by, check on the flour deliveries. don't you think it's odd that a successful wedding planner would come to check on flour deliveries? 
 Not really. 
 I mean, she probably has a lot of time on her hands, seeing how nobody's getting married anymore. 
 Me and my girlfriend, we've been together for six years. 
 She doesn't even care about getting married. 
 I get s*x, she cooks dinner, no firm commitment... boo-yah. 
 [Laughs] 
 What's your deal? 
 You're disgusting. 
 I'm a warehouse sweeper. 
 What were you expecting? 
 This guy knows nothing. 
 The capital of Bulgaria is Sofia. 
 All right, he knows one thing. 
 Thank you for your time, sir. 
 If you see anything unusual, please give us a call. 
 ♪ 
 Sometimes I saw the guys mix drugs into the flour. 
 I said call us! Ugh. 
 Lieutenant, I have a theory. 
 The wedding business is bad, so Jean Naté had to supplement her income. 
 By distributing drugs through her wedding cakes. 
 I mean, think about it... It's the perfect cover. 
 What cop is gonna bust up the happiest day of someone's life? 
 Pepper : I'm going in! 
 [Heart beating] 
 ♪ 
 Boo-yah! 
 Tribeca! 
 Tribeca! 
 Sorry. 
 So you need a baker to bake the drugs into the cakes. 
 Baker wants out? Boom... one dead baker. 
 So bust the wedding planner. 
 We can't. 
 She's not gonna just come out and say she's a drug dealer. 
 We have to catch her in the act. 
 Well, then go undercover as a bride and groom. 
 Plan a wedding. Just don't spend over $5,000. 
 $5,000 for a wedding in Los Angeles? 
 Sir, I don't think a wedding is a good idea... 
 No, it's a great idea, but we need a little money to make it real. 
 I'm just talking a ballroom, a band, some chicken, maybe a shave-ice station. 
 What the hell is a "shave ice"? 
 It's like a snow cone, but the way they get the ice is different. 
 How different? 
 It's more snow than ice. 
 I'm not getting a mental picture. 
 Hoffman, Tanner! Get the hell in here! 
 What do you guys know about shave ice? 
 It's not crystalline, like a snow cone. 
 It's smoother in texture, like ice cream. 
 [Barks] 
 No, not like a gelato. 
 This is not a dairy product. 
 Sir, I'd like to be removed from this case. 
 You know how I feel about wedding stuff after what happened to my partner. 
 Tribeca, we all loved Sergeant Pepper. 
 Remember how everyone around here used to work too hard? 
 I think it was 20 years ago today, Sergeant Pepper taught us how to play, and we're a better precinct for it. 
 But he's gone, and you've got a job to do. 
 Fine. 
 [Barks] 
 No, you're thinking of an Italian ice. 
 [Sighs] 
 How can I help you? 
 So, we'd like to get married as soon as possible. 
 We're very much in love. 
 Mm. 
 ♪ 
 Don't I recognize you from somewhere? 
 Hmm. 
 Never mind. I must be mistaken. 
 So, when were you thinking of getting married? 
 Would tomorrow be too soon? 
 That might be a little tight. What about the weekend? 
 We love weekends. 
 [Smooches] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Excuse me for a minute. 
 Jean Naté. 
 Would you please cool it? 
 You know this is not a real wedding. 
 I know that. 
 But if we don't believe it, she won't believe it. 
 Now, are you gonna commit to this wedding or not? 
 Why don't you commit to kissing my ass? 
 Oh, that's so crass. 
 I can't believe I'm saving myself for you. 
 Tomorrow? 
 Well, how much do you need? 
 Ooh, la la, that's a lot of drug... 
 Cake. 
 Drug-cake. 
 I could probably get that amount of drug-cake by tomorrow, but I don't have a wedding tomorrow. 
 Or do I? 
 Good news! 
 We can do it tomorrow. 
 Tomorrow? 
 Tomorrow? 
 That's gonna be great. 
 Tribeca, are you in or out?

 [Thud] Ow! 
 [Richard Wagner's "bridal chorus" plays]

 Let's just do it without her. 
 No, she's my partner.

 I'll talk to her.

 Aah! No, no! Not... not yet! Not...

 Hey, hey, hey. Come here. don't get all squishy on me. 
 He walked into that tunnel, and he never came out! 
 Look, I know this has been really tough on you, but how about this? 
 We put two of the city's best detectives on the case to find him. 
 And if they can't, then we will. 
 You're an idiot. You know that? 
 [Sniffling] 
 Look, this isn't a real wedding. It's a drug bust. 
 And if it's a ceremony solidifying anything, it's solidifying our partnership. 
 How's that? 
 [Sniffles] 
 Sounds good to me. 
 All right, let's do this. [Chuckles] 
 I have such deep feelings for you. 
 Sorry. What was that? 
 Nothing.

 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Glasses clinking] 
 I think they want us to kiss.

 Aah! [Applause] 
 Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

 If everyone will take their seats, in a few minutes we'll have the cake ceremony. 
 The cake. That's our cue. Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'll just put some ice on it.

 That's it. I'm going in. 
 I'm right behind you. 
 Hold it right there, Naté. 
 What is this? 
 You're under arrest for drug trafficking and murder. 
 Can I see your badge? 
 No, you can't, because I'm wearing dance shorts. 
 I think she said "badge." 
 Oh. 
 Don't worry. I have mine.

 Very good.
