 Good evening. 
 I'm helen mirren, And you're watching documentary now!, Season 50. 
 In order to tackle a dangerous topic, A documentary filmmaker Often has to put their own life on the line, And no group of filmmakers risk more Than those at dronez, A consortium of participant journalists Whose motto is, "ballz to the wallz." 
 And it should be noted that both "ballz" and "wallz" 
 Are spelled with zeds. 
 Please enjoy tonight's film, Dronez: The hunt for el chingon.
