 Elijah (voiceover): My siblings and I are the first vampires in history, the Originals. Three hundred years ago, we helped to build the city of New Orleans. We were happy here, a family. Recently, a coven of witches lured my brother back, using his unborn child as leverage. I tried to help him, but he betrayed me to his enemy, the vampire, Marcel. Since then, I've been held prisoner by a powerful witch. My brother seeks to manipulate others to procure my release. But, I have my own plan. If this witch proves to be an enemy, I will stop her. By whatever means necessary.  
 Davina's Attic – "Why should I trust you?" 
 [Elijah is standing in the attic, focusing on Davinas pulsing carotid artery. His skin looks very gray as a result of not feeding while he was daggered]  
 Davina: You're the one they call honorable.  
 [Elijah smiles]  
 Elijah: Yes, that's what they call me. And yet, I followed my brother here to New Orleans to engage in a war. So, I ask you: does that sound honorable to you?  
 Davina: You don't look well.  
 Elijah: Well, only this morning I had a mystical dagger embedded in my chest, so I'd say I'm holding myself together quite well. [beat] Davina, I believe that you and I have the power to end a war between witches and vampires before it truly begins. I, by keeping my brother in line; you, by behaving like your true self—not some tool for Marcel or the witches.  
 Davina: And why should I trust you?  
 Elijah: Well, for one thing, in spite of a ravenous hunger, I have not tried to take your blood.  
 Davina: Why not? I'm the only one here.  
 Elijah: Even in my present condition, I would not feed from a child.  
 [Davina takes a hat pin and pricks her finger with it. A drop of blood clings to the end of the needle, and she places the drop on Elijah's lip. After a moment, Elijah's skin returns to it's normal complexion. Davina looks pleased]  
 [OPENING CREDITS]  
 Mikaelson Mansion 
 [Klaus is pacing in the back kitchen of "Rousseau's." When Sophie comes in with some produce, Klaus grabs her and vamp-runs them back to the Mikaelson Mansion]  
 Klaus: We had a deal! You protect my unborn child, I dismantle Marcel's army. And whilst I've been busy fulfilling my part of the bargain, you allowed Hayley to be attacked and almost killed by a gaggle of lunatic witches.  
 Sophie: I had nothing to do with it, I swear. Hayley and I are linked, remember? She dies, I die.  
 Rebekah: Then who were they?  
 Sophie: They are a faction of extremists. Sabine stupidly told them about some vision she had about the baby.  
 Klaus: What kind of vision?  
 Sophie: She has them all the time. They are totally open to interpretation. I'm guessing she's wrong on this one.  
 Klaus: Well, how, may I ask, was this particular vision interpreted?  
 Sophie: Pretty much that your baby would bring death to all witches.  
 Klaus: Ah, well. I grow fonder of this child by the second.  
 Rebekah: Sophie, look, I promised Elijah that I would protect the Mikaelson miracle baby whilst he tries to win your witch Davina's loyalty. Why don't you tell me just how extreme this faction is?  
 Sophie: Elijah's talking to Davina?  
 Rebekah: Yeah. As we speak, I imagine.  
 Sophie: I'm guessing she'll have plenty to say about that crowd.  
 Klaus: Do tell.  
 Sophie: I... wasn't always an advocate for the witches.  
 FLASHBACK – 8 MONTHS AGO  
 [At Rousseau's, Sophie dances to music behind the bar as the crowd cheers]  
 Sophie: [shouts to crowd] Woo, drink up everybody! This is how they party in Rio! [pours liquor straight into her mouth from the bottle]  
 Sophie: [present day] My sister was devoted, like our parents, and our upbringing was very strict, which drove me nuts. The minute I turned 21, I left the Quarter to travel... and play. [Flashback Sophie pours alcohol into a girl's mouth and kisses her after she drinks it] But, I wanted to be a chef, so I came back to Rousseau's.  
 [In flashback, Jane-Anne enters Rousseau's to find her sister]  
 Sophie: Oh, Jane-Anne! [Jane-Anne smiles and the girls hug]  
 Jane-Anne: Welcome home, Soph. Can we go some place to talk?  
 Sophie: Just tell me.  
 Jane-Anne: The elders called a vote. We're moving forward with the Harvest.  
 Sophie: [stunned] What?  
 PRESENT DAY  
 Rebekah: What the bloody hell is a Harvest?  
 Sophie: It's a ritual our coven does every three centuries, so that the bond to our ancestral magic is restored. We appease our ancestors, they keep our ancestral power flowing.  
 Klaus: And why haven't I heard of this?  
 Sophie: Because a Harvest always seemed like a myth. A story, passed on through generations like Noah's ark, or the Buddha walking on water. The kind some people take literally, and some people don't.  
 FLASHBACK – HARVEST  
 [Some young witches are standing and kneeling in a row outside a farmhouse. An older witch, Bastiana, holds a knife]  
 Bastiana: [makes a small cut on the first girl, Monique's hand] To be reborn, we must sacrifice.  
 Monique: To be reborn, we must sacrifice.  
 Bastiana: To be reborn, we must have faith. [cuts the second girl's hand]  
 Second Girl: To be reborn, we must have faith.  
 Bastiana: Do you have faith in the Harvest? [cuts the third girl's hand]  
 [Sophie shows up and approaches the witches]  
 Sophie: Not for a second!  
 Monique: Sophie!  
 Sophie: What are you doing?  
 Bastiana: Saving the community you renounced.  
 Sophie: You're all ridiculous. Monique, seriously?  
 Monique: [reluctantly] My mom told me I had to.  
 Sophie: Yeah. Well, your mom and I are gonna have words.  
 [Davina is the last girl in the row, and she watches as Sophie storms away]  
 PRESENT DAY  
 Sophie: They had the girls of our community preparing for months. Four would be choosen for the Harvest. They said that it was an honor, that they were special. I thought it was a myth.  
 Rebekah: Was it?  
 [Sophie looks guilty, but before she can say anything, Klaus's cell phone rings. He picks it up—it's Marcel.)  
 Klaus: Marcel. Bit early in the day for you, isn't it?  
 Marcel: I know, I make this look easy, but I still have an empire to run.  
 Klaus: Rather you than me. All that responsibility seems like such a bore.  
 Marcel: Well, this might spice things up. I just heard about a bunch of dead witches out in the bayou. The kinda damage a werewolf might do, only there was no full moon. I have an informant out there I need to meet and I would love for you to go with me.  
 Klaus: Dead witches in the bayou. Sounds like less of a problem, and more like a cause for celebration.  
 Marcel: Well, something killed them. And may still be out there. And with your blood the only cure for a werewolf bite, I would love for you to accompany me.  
 Klaus: Oh, why not? Haven't been to the bayou in ages. I'm on my way.  
 Marcel: Peace out, brother.  
 [Marcel hangs up. He is holding a picture of a large house in his hands]  
 Marcel: [to a woman he is with] This is the one.  
 MIKAELSON MANSION  
 Sophie: You can't go out there now. I need to gather the witches' remains and consecrate them. If I don't get to them before sundown, we'll lose the link to their magic.  
 Klaus: Those witches tried to kill Hayley. I'd prefer for Marcel's informant not to find anything that would lead him back to us, to her, or to... you know, [points at Hayley's stomach] that. Hayley: You are all class.  
 Klaus: [points at Sophie] Stay put. And save the rest of your story 'til I return.  
 St. Ann's Church  
 [Father Kieran is sweeping the church when Marcel enters.]  
 Father Kieran: Look who's back. Here to visit your prisoner in the attic?  
 Marcel: Lay off. She's not a prisoner. And I'm moving her tonight. Too many people know where she is.  
 Father Kieran: I have been hearing about what you've been up to since I've been out of town. Using that girl to keep the witches from doing magic?  
 Marcel: All respect, Father K. If you're going defend the witches' rights, we got nothin' to talk about.  
 Davina's Attic  
 [Davina is drawing while Elijah walks around. He holds Tim's damaged violin in his hand]  
 Elijah: Do you play? Davina: That's... not mine.  
 [Elijah sits in a chair and tinkers with the violin for a moment, until Marcel's steps can be heard from outside the room. When he enters, Elijah has hidden himself away]  
 Marcel: Good news, Little D. I'm moving you out this pile of dust.  
 Davina: Are you serious? When? Marcel: Tonight. I just need to lock in the arrangements. How's our Original? [gestures to Elijah's coffin]  
 Davina: Uh, don't disturb the body! I have a spell in progress.  
 Marcel: Bet you do. Pack up, 'kay? Only what you wanna take. I'll buy ya anything else you need.  
 Davina: Okay.  
 [Marcel leaves the attic. Elijah appears from behind a corner]  
 Elijah: You didn't reveal that I was awake. Davina: We're not done talking yet.  
 [Elijah picks up the violin again and sits down]  
 Elijah: You and Marcel seem very close.  
 Davina: Marcel's my family.  
 Elijah: And yet Marcel is someone who delights in harming the witches. Those people, I would think, you would consider family. This doesn't trouble you?  
 Davina: No. They deserve it.  
 Elijah: Why would you say that?  
 Davina: 'Cause they're liars. All of them.  
 [Return to the flashback of the young witches and the elder witches by the farmhouse. The girls still kneel in a row, and Bastiana touches four of the girls' foreheads to indicate who has been chosen. Monique, Davina, and two other girls were chosen for the Harvest]  
 Davina: (voiceover) They made me and my friends do this Harvest ritual. They said our participation would bring our family strength, health... that we'd forever be celebrated as saviors of the community. But all they really wanted was more power. So, I left before they could get it. Now, they're running out of time, because after the Harvest, comes the Reaping. And if they don't complete the Harvest, there won't be a Reaping. Soon, all the witches in the Quarter will start to lose their power. Eventually, they will cease to be witches altogether. Elijah: So what does it take to complete this ritual?  
 Davina: I have to die.  
 [Elijah is shocked by this revelation]  
 Lafayette Cemetery  
 [Sophie is in the cemetery, packing a little bottle into her backpack, when Hayley enters the mausoleum]  
 Sophie: Hey. What the hell?  
 Hayley: You're going out there anyway, aren't you? I wanna go with you.  
 Sophie: No, thanks. Already got assaulted by Klaus this morning. Don't need a repeat.  
 Hayley: What if whatever is responsible for all those dead witches is still out there? We've already established that it likes me and hates witches, so you'll be safer with me.  
 Sophie: Sorry if I'm not buying your sudden concern for my safety.  
 [Hayley blocks the exit, forcing Sophie to stop.]  
 Hayley: Listen. The whole reason I came to this stupid town in the first place was to learn more about my family. Your sister's the one that told me Marcel ran the werewolves out of the Quarter, into the bayou. And, last night, I'm pretty sure that some guardian-angel-wolf saved my life. So, I'm coming with you.  
 [Rebekah walks in to the mausoleum and joins the girls]  
 Rebekah: Could you two be more idiotic?  
 [Hayley and Sophie both look around at each other and sigh]  
 Rebekah: Two can play the follow-game, you know! You heard Klaus, he and Marcel are headed right where you're going.  
 Hayley: So distract them. Because unless you wanna see lock a hormonal, pregnant werewolf in a tomb, I'm coming with you. And wouldn't Elijah be mad if he hears that the baby and I died of asphyxiation?  
 [Rebekah stares at her, annoyed. Sophie rolls her eyes and sighs again, resigned to having Hayley and Rebekah tag along]  
 Big Auggie's Bayou Bar  
 [Klaus is standing in front of the bar, phoning Rebekah]  
 Klaus: What's the matter Rebekah? You cross that I'm out with your ex?  
 Rebekah: What is all that dreadful hillbilly ruckus in the background?  
 Klaus: According to the dreadful signage, it's Big Auggie's Bayou Bar.  
 Rebekah: Well, order up a few rounds of moonshine and steer clear of the dead witches for a few. The witch is on a burial mission, your baby mama is on a spirit quest, and I'm keeping Elijah's promise to keep her safe, so stall, please?  
 [Rebekah hangs up the phone. Klaus, who is angry and annoyed, enters the bar]  
 Marcel: Everything okay?  
 Klaus: Oh, just the usual. Temperamental sister. So, where's your informant?  
 Marcel: Tomas? He's out sniffin' around. Grab a drink, and then we'll chase him down. Klaus: Well, I suppose it will give us a chance to talk things over, like why you haven't returned Elijah. Maybe your young witch has grown partial to his company. She must get so bored.  
 Marcel: You never stop, do you?  
 Klaus: You never answer, do you?  
 Marcel: Why're you so curious about Davina?  
 Klaus: If I had a 16-year-old, all-powerful witch at my beck and call, you would wonder about her, too.  
 Marcel: You're never gonna get her.  
 Klaus: Okay, okay. I'll ask the harmless questions, then. How did you meet her?  
 Marcel: [laughs] That might surprise you. This was eight months ago, before I banned the witches from using magic. Relations between vampires and witches weren't what you'd you call friendly, by any means, but let's just say we were a little less... divided. In fact, some of us were getting along just fine.  
 FLASHBACK  
 [Sophie Deveraux and Marcel are taking a shower together, making out with each other and presumably having s*x. Afterward, Marcel lies in his bed, while Sophie dries herself off beside him]  
 Sophie: Ugh, it's so screwed up, I'm dealing with whacked-out, militant witches.  
 Marcel: [smiling] Hey, you witches all got a little crazy in you.  
 Sophie: And my sister has really gone off the deep-end this time.  
 Marcel: Jane-Anne's got martyr written all over her, that's for sure.  
 Sophie: They've got every 16-year-old girl in our coven dying to be one of the four chosen for this crazy-ass ritual.  
 Marcel: Anything I can do to help? Sophie: No, you've caused enough trouble with them. Marcel: What, little old me?  
 Sophie: [giggles] You're a dick. You always stir it up with the witches. Which is why this [kisses him] stays between us. [kisses him deeply]  
 PRESENT DAY  
 Klaus: You and Sophie? You hypocrite. You torture those witches, and yet there you were, getting positively Romeo and Juliet with Sophie Deveraux.  
 Marcel: Oh, hey hey hey, it wasn't like that. It was a... mutually satisfying hook-up.  
 Klaus: So, if Sophie didn't turn to you, her secret vampire lover, in her hour of need, what did she do?  
 Marcel: She did what any good girl do. She went to her priest.  
 FLASHBACK  
 [Sophie, Father Kieran, Jane-Anne, Bastiana and Agnes are in the St. Anne's Church]  
 Bastiana: You've never cared about witch business, Sophie. And now, you have the gall to reveal our private dealings to an outsider.  
 Father Kieran: You have to find another way.  
 Bastiana: You think we do this lightly? The vampire presence in the Quarter is growing stronger, we need more power to fight them off. Harsh times call for harsh measures.  
 Sophie: This is a little more than harsh, Bastiana.  
 Jane-Anne: [to Sophie] You don't understand, because you don't believe. You've never believed. But I believe enough to put everything on the line for this. And being chosen for the offering – it's an honor.  
 Sophie: It's a myth, Jane-Anne.  
 Father Kieran: What you are planning to do is not only wrong; in my city, it's illegal.  
 Jane-Anne: In your city full of vampires? Father Kieran: The vampires and the human faction have an arrangement, just like we have with you all. Protect the locals, protect our homes, we look the other way. What you are planning goes too far.  
 Bastiana: We are simply taking what we need. Our connection to our ancestors weakens over time. You sow, and you reap; that's the way the Harvest works.  
 Father Kieran: I am the only ally the witches have in this town! Do you really wanna face Marcel without me? Because that is what you'll be dealing with if you go through with the Harvest.  
 [Sean O'Connell hears the argument and comes out to investigate]  
 Sean: Everything okay in here, Uncle Kieran?  
 Father Kieran: We're just finishing, Sean. Right? [glares at the witches] I believe I've made myself clear.  
 Agnes: We'll take this matter to the elders. [turns to Sean and grasps his hand in hers] Continue your studies, Sean. Your uncle is an excellent role model. [smiles]  
 [Sean nods, and as Agnes turns to leave, she mutters a hex under her breath]  
 PRESENT DAY  
 Marcel: The witches were furious with Kieran. Sophie tells me that the witches put a hex on his nephew Sean, made it seem like he was slowly losing his mind in order to distract Kieran, while they kept planning for the Harvest.  
 Klaus: [angry] So they attacked Kieran's nephew.  
 Marcel: Yeah. Kid wasn't the same after that, ended up going postal, killing all his fellow seminary students, all of them, and then himself.  
 Klaus: I might have read about that. The boy... killed a twin, or he was a twin or something.  
 Marcel: Ah, no no no, they said he had a twin sister.  
 [Marcel sips his liquor, while Klaus downs all of his in one gulp, obviously angered at learning that the witches hexed Cami's brother into killing all of those people]  
 Davina's attic  
 [Elijah is still fiddling around with the violin as Davina packs her suitcase]  
 Elijah: So, enlighten me. What did you mean when you said you had to die?  
 Davina: That's was the Harvest was. They said they'd put us four girls in a state of, like, peaceful limbo as part of the offering. And then later, at the Reaping, we'd awaken and be reborn. I never got as far as the limbo part, which means the Harvest isn't complete. That's why the witches are so freaked out. The Reaping is just around the corner, and if they don't finish it before then, it's over. All I have to do is wait it out.  
 Elijah: And then what?  
 Davina: They're punished, and I'm free.  
 Elijah: From Marcel?  
 Davina: Of magic. All our power will drain away. I'll be normal.  
 [Davina smiles slightly]  
 Elijah: Is that what you want? To be normal?  
 Davina: I just don't wanna be what I am. I can't control it sometimes. Magic. I... [tears up] hurt people. Even when I don't mean to.  
 Elijah: Why don't you tell me about your friends. You must miss them.  
 Davina: There's Tim. He doesn't know about any of this witch stuff. He's normal. My best friend, Monique. She was a part of the Harvest too. She's lucky. No one ever fought for me, but someone fought for her. The only one who ever spoke out against the Harvest was Monique's aunt.  
 Elijah: And who is that?  
 Davina: [sighs] Sophie Deveraux.  
 [Elijah continues to look shocked about what he is learning]  
 
 
 
 The Bayou  
 [Sophie, Rebekah and Hayley continue to walk around the Bayou to look for the dead witches]  
 Rebekah: So, this Harvest thingy—tell me more.  
 Sophie: Klaus said to wait. Rebekah: Yes. He also said to stay out of the bayou and yet here we are, amongst the crawly, buzzy creatures.  
 Hayley: We're here.  
 [They have reached the place where the witches were killed. They're all bloodied and ripped apart, and a dismembered head lies near the bodies. Sophie, who looks sick, kneels down to dig around her bag for the ingredients she needs to consecrate her fellow witches]  
 Hayley: Whoa.  
 [Hayley sees a huge pawprint in the mud. In a nearby tree, there are three bloody scratches in the bark]  
 Sophie: Is that a wolf track?  
 [They hear a crunching noise, like footsteps, nearby]  
 Rebekah: [calls out] Who's there?  
 [The person approaching them is a male vampire – Marcel's informant, Tomas]  
 Thomas: What the hell? An Original?  
 [He runs away with vampire speed, leaving the girls standing and gaping]  
 [Klaus walks outside of Big Auggie's Bayou Bar as he talks to Rebekah on his cell phone]  
 Klaus: Let me understand this: against all logic, you and Hayley went to the bayou, where you ran into a man you think may be Marcel's informant, and then you lost him?  
 Rebekah: Yes, and now that we've established that I am a failure as a sister, and a friend, and an Original, you should probably know he's on his way to Marcel right now to rat me out. Skinny guy in a hurry, looks like he saw a ghost.  
 Klaus: I'll handle it, but I'll need a distraction. [smiles]  
 Rebekah: I'm on my way.  
 [She hangs up, and swats at a mosquito that has landed on her arm. Klaus enters the bar again.]  
 Marcel: Your sister again?  
 Klaus: She craves attention. So come along, you were just getting to the juicy bits.  
 Marcel: I can't joke around about this. I've done a lot in my day, but I do have a rule about kids.  
 [The story about the Harvest continues as Marcel tells it to Klaus, and Davina tells it to Elijah. The scenes alternate between the two storytellers, as well as flashback sequences.]  
 DAVINA'S ATTIC  
 Davina: No one but Sophie ever questioned the Harvest. Not even my own mother. So neither did I. We thought it was such an honor, we had such faith. We were so stupid.  
 Elijah: So how did it begin?  
 Davina: We were led out like princesses. My mother was so proud.  
 FLASHBACK  
 [It's night now, and the four girls are led into the Lafayette Cemetery by the elders to start the Harvest. There are birdbaths with liquid that is lit on fire burning around them]  
 Bastiana: Our magic fades as our ties to our ancestors weaken over time. We beseech them, accept this offering as a sign of our faith.  
 [The girls kneel in a row in the middle of the crowd of people]  
 DAVINA'S ATTIC  
 Davina: Bastiana, one of the Elders, called upon the four elements to bind our past and future magic together. Earth, to connect us to our ancestors. Water, to heal the community. Wind, to carry us to our ancestors and back. Fire, to purify. After all our preperation, we knew exactly what to expect. For weeks they told us that the magic in the knife they used to cut our palms would put us to sleep, and that later at the Reaping, we would all be resurrected. They said we'd awaken, and all be together and more powerful than ever. And it was just like we rehearsed it. All that was left was a little cut on our palms for the blood sacrifice.  
 FLASHBACK  
 [The first girl stands up to begin the Harvest, but is interrupted when Sophie runs into the cemetery]  
 Sophie: No! Stop! Bastiana, stop! You have to stop, Bastiana, please don't do this!  
 [A male witch wraps his arms around Sophie to restrain her, and covers her mouth with his hand so she can't intervene or scream anymore]  
 Davina: [voiceover] Even after Sophie tried to stop it, we didn't suspect anything.  
 Bastiana: To be born, you must sacrifice. Do you have faith?  
 [The girl nods in response, and holds out her hand for the blood sacrifice. Instead, Bastiana slits the girl's throat, and the young witch falls to the ground. The other three girls start to scream in terror, but they're also restrained so that they can't run away. Davina's mother stares straight ahead as her daughter screams]  
 DAVINA'S ATTIC  
 Elijah: Everyone involved in the ritual knew that this would happen.  
 Davina: Except the four of us. They weren't putting us to sleep, they were slaughtering us!  
 FLASHBACK  
 [The next witch is pushed forward, and Bastiana slashes her throat with the knife as well, despite her protests]  
 Davina: No, no!  
 Bastiana: Monique Deveraux.  
 Davina: NO, NO, NOOO!  
 [A man forces Monique forward to be sacrificed next]  
 Davina: [voiceover] I begged for someone to help. My own mother turned away from me. Sophie screamed and screamed for her sister, anyone, to do something.  
 Sophie: What is wrong with you!?  
 [Jane-Anne looks worried, but does nothing]  
 DAVINA'S ATTIC  
 Davina: But no one did. Elijah: And yet you survived. Therefore, someone or something intervened.  
 [Davina nods]  
 Davina: Yes. Someone finally did.  
 FLASHBACK  
 Sophie: Monique, run away! Run away!  
 [A shrill whistle can be heard, and a group of vampires, led by Marcel, infiltrates the cemetery and they start killing the witches]  
 Sophie: Marcel.  
 BIG AUGGIE'S BAYOU BAR  
 Klaus: You're the one who stopped it.  
 Marcel: Kieran knew every detail from Sophie. After his nephew's massacre in the church, he was so torn up. He left town just before the Harvest. But on his way out, he came to me, and he asked me to stop the Harvest. He knew I didn't want the witches getting any more power. And I do have a rule about people abusing kids, so, I did what he asked. But I was too late.  
 FLASHBACK  
 [The vampires are still attacking the Elders. A vampire bites Bastiana and feeds on her until she dies, and when her body falls to the ground, so does the magic knife in her hand. Another vampire bites and kills Davina's mom. Agnes picks up the knife from the ground, and grabs Monique and slits her throat with it. Davina screams, hysterical and trying to break free.]  
 Davina: No, Monique! Nooo! Let go of me! Stop it! Stop it! Let go of me! Stop it!  
 [Davina fights against the guy holding her. Marcel watches her fight against him as she headbutts the guy in the face, so Marcel kills the man and grabs Davina protectively]  
 Marcel: I got you.  
 BIG AUGGIE'S BAYOU BAR  
 Marcel: There was something about seeing Davina fight. She didn't just go along to the slaughter, you know?  
 Klaus: [smiles slightly] I do... Marcellus. Marcel: [somberly] I felt like she and I... we were kindred spirits.  
 FLASHBACK  
 [Marcel is still holding Davina, while Sophie kneels on the ground, holding Monique's body in her lap. Sophie looks up at Marcel and Davina, and Davina holds her hand out toward Monique. A light inside Monique leaks out of her body, and into Davina's outstretched hand, and Sophie and Marcel stare at her in amazement]  
 DAVINA'S ATTIC  
 Davina: Every girl who died released her power on to the next. When I was the last one, I suddenly had all of it, all the power that was supposed to be released back into the earth to appease our ancestors.  
 Elijah: So... the Harvest was actually working?  
 Davina: Something was working. And I knew that I was supposed to be killed so the Harvest could be completed and we would all be resurrected. But, they lied to us about how they were killing us. How do I know they weren't lying to us about coming back? [beat] But mostly, I just didn't want to die. So, I let him save me. Marcel saved my life.  
 [In the flashback, Marcel sees the surprised look on Sophie's face, and vamp-runs himself and Davina away before she could get hurt. In the present, Elijah looks disgusted by how Davina was treated, and feels sympathy for her]  
 Big Auggie's Bayou Bar  
 Klaus: You were quite the knight in shining armor, though Davina must realise you owe her as much as she owes you. You never could have banned the witches from using magic without her.  
 Marcel: She's not exactly besties with them. I'm protecting her. A lot of them would like to get their hands on her and kill her to finish the Harvest. If they don't, the other girls stay dead, and they lose their power.  
 Klaus: And if they you do, you lose yours. Marcel: And Davina loses her life.  
 [Rebekah shows up and joins them]  
 Rebekah: Isn't this like old times? Just how drunk are you two?  
 Klaus: [fakes slurring his words] Skating on the razor's edge. I'm gonna use the loo. Back in a tick.  
 Rebekah: I haven't seen him this lushy since the '20s. Marcel: So you came to take him home?  
 Rebekah: Why else would I be here?  
 Marcel: I don't know. Maybe to make sure I didn't get too drunk and spill secrets better left unspilled about you and me. I know better.  
 Rebekah: I hope so, because you don't wanna end up on the wrong side of me.  
 Marcel: Oh, Rebekah Mikaelson. You do not wanna be on the wrong side of me.  
 [The two stare at each other intently]  
 OUTSIDE OF THE BAR  
 [Klaus walks outside and sees Tomas, who has just returned from the bayou]  
 Klaus: Tomas, I presume. Marcel asked me to find out what you know about the dead witches.  
 Tomas: I heard they were going after some pregnant werewolf. She was stupid, being out there all alone.  
 Klaus: Yeah, she was, wasn't she, yes? It's amazing how gullible some people can be.  
 [Klaus chuckles and snaps the vampire's neck]  
 [Elijah proudly holds up Tim's violin]  
 Elijah: You may return this now to its rightful owner. It's restored.  
 [Davina takes the instrument and stares at it sadly]  
 Davina: I don't even know if I'll see him again.  
 [The room starts to shake, as if they're in an earthquake. Elijah and Davina look around worriedly, and the window shutters burst open as the shaking stops]  
 Elijah: Davina, this power that you contain, drawn from your fallen friends—it's too much for you. You need control, which requires study and practice. Now, my mother was a very powerful witch. She left behind her grimoires, a legacy of books filled with spells. These books contain all of the tools that you might need to control your magic. If you free me from here, I can share them with you. However, if you leave now with Marcel, we'll never see each other again, and I cannot find you, and I can't help you.  
 Davina: The witches manipulated me. You know how that ended.  
 Elijah: This is not manipulation. This is one thing in exchange for another. I'm offering you a deal.  
 [Klaus enters the bar again. Marcel is gone; Rebekah returns to the bar from the restroom.]  
 Klaus: That was fast work, Rebekah. Where's Marcel? In there, touching up his lipstick?  
 Rebekah: Credit me with some taste, it's filthy in there. Where'd he go. Klaus: He didn't tell you he was leaving?  
 Rebekah: No. Do you think he realized we were stalling him?  
 Klaus: No. Unless... he was stalling us.  
 [Marcel bursts into Davina's room. Elijah is hiding in his coffin]  
 Marcel: Okay, now's our shot. You ready to blow this joint?  
 Davina: [smiles] Can't wait.  
 [Marcel grabs Davina's suitcase and the two get ready to leave the room]  
 Marcel: We'll leave Elijah behind as a parting gift. Might buy me a little forgiveness for pulling one over on his siblings. Let's go.  
 [The two leave the attic, though Davina gives her room a final parting glance before she goes. When the two of them are out of earshot, Elijah pulls himself out of his coffin. Downstairs, Marcel walks ahead of Davina. She stops suddenly in the middle of the church's main room, and he turns to look at her]  
 Marcel: What's wrong? What's happening?  
 [The church starts shaking, and Davina's body tenses up as her body starts to spasm]  
 Davina: I don't know. Something's wrong.  
 [Marcel runs up to Davina to help her]  
 Davina: Marcel. There's something dangerous out there. Take me back!  
 [Davina passes out, and Marcel catches her]  
 Marcel: Damn it.  
 [He picks her up and carries her back to her room. Upstairs, Elijah waits in the doorway and smiles. He has hidden by the time Marcel brings her back up to her room and puts her into her bed. He tucks her in under her blankets, and after looking at her for a moment, he takes his leave. Once he's gone, Davina opens her eyes and lifts her head]  
 FLASHBACK  
 [Marcel and Davina enter the attic room for the first time]  
 Marcel: No one's gonna look for you here. It's only for a little while, 'til I get you out of town and some place safe. For now I can get you whatever you want. What do you like to do?  
 Davina: [whispers nervously] Draw.  
 Marcel: An artist, huh? That's cool, okay. I can buy out Vincent's for you tomorrow. Maybe get you some curtains, or–  
 Davina: Marcel? You know what I really want? [beat] I wanna make them pay.  
 (Marcel nods.)  
 PRESENT DAY  
 [Davina sits up in bed]  
 Davina: [calls out] Elijah?  
 Elijah: [comes out of hiding] I'm pleased you stayed.  
 Davina: You'll keep your promise about your mother's spell book?  
 Elijah: I will. You know, difficulties aside, I value my family above everything. I am sorry that yours failed you.  
 Davina: Your brother Klaus handed you to Marcel in a box, yet you still don't give up on him?  
 Elijah: Well, I've given up on giving up. It's an affliction. I will fight for my family until my last breath.  
 Davina: And I'll fight the witches until mine.  
 St. Anne's Church  
 Father Kieran: Now what? You just gonna leave her up there for anybody to find?  
 Marcel: I'm not in the mood, Kieran.  
 Father Kieran: You were supposed to get her out of New Orleans after the Harvest. We failed those other three girls, we didn't fail her. That is why I came to you for help. That was the plan.  
 Marcel: Plans change.  
 Father Kieran: Especially after you found out how powerful she was.  
 Marcel: Let's get something straight. For eight months since you left, I've been running this town just fine. I don't need you coming back and gettin' in my business. I will do what I want, where I want. Got it?  
 Father Kieran: You wanna be the boss? You wanna call the shots? Fine. But I call the shots with the humans. And you don't wanna make an enemy of me. So, I would suggest one thing—stay away from my niece.  
 Marcel: Fine. Who the hell's your niece?  
 Father Kieran: Cami.  
 [Marcel stops in his tracks and considers this news for a moment, before huffing in frustration and leaving]  
 [It's night now, and Hayley and Sophie are returning to Sophie's truck]  
 Hayley: Those people, all this, because of a vision about my baby you don't think is true?  
 Sophie: Look, I love Sabine, but she's the witch equivalent of a drama queen. I've learned to take little stock in whatever she says or sees. Just kinda wish she'd kept her mouth shut.  
 Hayley: The Harvest ritual. You said you didn't believe in it. Were you right?  
 Sophie: No. I saw it with my own eyes. It was working. It was real.  
 Hayley: So, how can you be so sure Sabine's vision isn't?  
 [Sophie doesn't have an answer]  
 Outside the Abattoir 
 [Marcel walks into the courtyard where Klaus is waiting for him up on the top of a cement barrier]  
 Klaus: Taking me on a field trip to distract me. Pathetic. And obvious—I taught you better than that.  
 Marcel: You taught me to protect what's mine. You will not take Davina from me—end of story.  
 Klaus: An immutable law of nature, Marcel, is the strong always take from the weak.  
 Marcel: Oh, if you were so strong, you wouldn't have run away from New Orleans like a little bitch, all those years ago.  
 [Klaus jumps down from where he was standing and punches down on Marcel]  
 Klaus: You've been playing king with a bunch of children for too long. Don't mistake me for one of your nightwalker lackeys, Marcel. I can take Davina anytime I like.  
 [Marcel lunges for Klaus, but he's knocked back down by Elijah, who has appeared out of nowhere]  
 Elijah: Do forgive me, Marcel. If anyone is to teach my brother a lesson... it's me.  
 [Klaus stares in shock at his brother, and doesn't seem too pleased to see him]  
 Mikaelson Mansion  
 [Rebekah pours several drinks as she talks to Hayley]  
 Rebekah: I don't care if we have to get you a leash, that was your last trip to the bayou. What is it with you and those wolves, anyway?  
 Hayley: I feel like we're connected somehow. I don't know. Maybe it's just some pipe dream that I have of finding any real family out there. But sometimes, when I feel like it's me against the world, it keeps me going.  
 [Rebekah gives Hayley a sympathetic look and hands her a drink. Hayley side-eyes her, and Rebekah suddenly remembers that Hayley is pregnant and can't drink, so she drinks Hayley's glass in one gulp, and then drinks her own]  
 Rebekah: Oh, right. Well, if you ask me, family is a pain in the behind.  
 [Hayley rolls her eyes]  
 Rebekah: And as for being in it alone, how dare you? I don't ruin a perfectly fabulous pair of boots traipsing through the bayou for just anyone.  
 [Hayley smiles, and Rebekah downs her second drink. Their conversation is interrupted by Klaus walking through the front door]  
 Rebekah: Nik, finally. What–  
 [Elijah walks through the door after his brother with a huge smile. Rebekah runs to Elijah and hugs him tight. Elijah sees Hayley over Rebekah's shoulder, and they smile at each other, though Hayley leaves the room right after]  
 Rebekah: Elijah! You're safe! Now that you're home, is your first plan to kill Niklaus?  
 Elijah: [smiles] Excuse me, just a moment.  
 Rebekah: Where's he going?  
 [Elijah walks out the back door to find Hayley, who is standing on the back patio]  
 Hayley: You're back.  
 Elijah: I'm back.  
 [The two look at each other for a moment, and then Hayley slaps him in the face]  
 Hayley: Don't make promises you can't keep. Welcome home.  
 [Elijah touches his face where she slapped him, and smiles to himself]  
 Mikaelson Mansion  
 [The Mikaelson siblings and Hayley sit in the study, where Elijah stands behind the desk and explains everything that he has learned from Davina that day]  
 Elijah: Everything that brought us here to New Orleans was a lie. This story that Sophie Deveraux fabricated, this struggle for control of the French Quarter, this war between vampires and witches, wasn't over territory at all, this was over Davina.  
 FLASHBACK  
 [In the back room of Rousseau's, Jane-Anne and Sophie are both sobbing and arguing]  
 Sophie: I swear, I had no idea that the Harvest could possibly be real!  
 Jane-Anne: But the one thing that you were sure of is that I was wrong, and that I would risk Monique's life on a maybe. And now my daughter is dead.  
 Sophie: Please tell me how to fix this.  
 Jane-Anne: Now that Marcel has Davina, how we are even supposed to find her? If we don't finish the Harvest, Monique and those two other girls are dead for real.  
 [Sophie steps toward her sister and grabs her hands]  
 Sophie: Look at me. You and I are gonna find a way to get Monique back. It'll be our little secret. We'll do it together. I'll seal off the cemetery from the vampires, find Davina, stop Marcel and finish the ritual once and for all. Even if I have to slit Davina's throat myself.  
 PRESENT DAY  
 Elijah: Eight months ago, Sophie Deveraux and her sister Jane-Anne lost everything. Now, four months after that, a young pregnant girl wanders into their restaurant. Suddenly, all hope is renewed. Jane-Anne actually sacrificed her life so that her sister can use you to find Davina. If Sophie Deveraux is successful in capturing Davina, she can return Jane-Anne's daughter back to life. We thought we'd come here to wage a war for power. This is about family. In order to return her niece to life, Sophie Deveraux will fight to the death. That makes her more dangerous than anyone.  
 [As they speak, Sophie kneels in front of Jane-Anne's grave at Lafayette Cemetery in the pouring rain, crying]
