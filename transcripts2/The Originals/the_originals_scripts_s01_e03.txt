 (Hayley is sitting on the floor, holding a thick book in her hands, reading.  
 Klaus and Rebekah are standing nearby.)  
 Elijah: (voiceover) August 1359. I have noticed a difference in my siblings. Our bond strains beneath the pressure of our life as vampires. Each day removes them further from the humanity we once possessed. My sweet sister, Rebekah, has grown quite indifferent to brutality.  
 (In a flashback Rebekah can be seen, killing the vampires who attacked Hayley in the previous episode.)  
 Elijah: (voiceover) However, the true problem remains my brother, Niklaus.  
 (In a flashback Klaus can be seen pouring petrol over the dead vampires and burning them.)  
 Elijah: (voiceover) He continues to hide his loneliness with cruelty. Still, I cling to the hope that I, as their eldest brother, can lead them down the correct path, a path charged with the power of a family united. For if I fail, our family's legacy will end in darkness.  
 Rebekah: I cannot believe you disposed of those vampires without me. You know how I love to set things on fire.  
 Klaus: Was I supposed to leave them in the front yard to rot? Besides, they were my responsibility. They attacked the helpless pregnant girl who's carrying my child.  
 Rebekah: Oh, I am so moved by your newfound sense of fatherly duties towards the werewolf carrying your hybrid bun in her oven.  
 (Hayley enters the room)  
 Hayley: The werewolf would like to know what the plan is.  
 Klaus: Well, that depends what plan you mean, love: My plan for global domination, or Rebekah's plan to find love in a cruel, cruel world.  
 (Rebekah takes a pencil from the desk beside her and throws it in Klaus' direction. Klaus catches it easily before it can impale his face.)  
 Hayley: The plan to rescue Elijah. You know, the good brother. The one who is now in the possession of your mortal enemy after you stabbed him in the back.  
 Klaus: In the front, if we're being specific.  
 Hayley: You two said that you would get him back. So is there a plan, or what?  
 Klaus: Okay. Well, firstly, Marcel is not my mortal enemy—he's my friend, albeit one who is unaware that I'm trying to sabotage his hold over the supernatural community of the French Quarter, but a friend nonetheless. And secondly, I daggered Elijah in order to gain Marcel's trust. If I had known he would place my brother in the hands of a particularly nasty teenaged witch, I certainly would have weighed my options a bit differently. And thirdly, sister, please.  
 Rebekah: And thirdly, the plan, as you have demanded, is for Niklaus to simply ask Marcel for Elijah back.  
 Hayley: That's... that's not the whole plan, is it?  
 Rebekah: Please, Klaus may be a miserable excuse for a sibling, but there is none more diabolical.  
 Klaus: And that's only the Plan A, love. There's always a Plan B.  
 Hayley: And what's Plan B?  
 Klaus: War.  
 (TITLE CARD AND OPENING CREDITS)  
 THE ABATTOIRE 
 (Marcel gets fitted for a suit, accompanied by Thierry.)  
 Marcel: Damn, I do look good in a suit.  
 (Thierry chuckles, then turns to the television, where photos of Tina McGreevy and Joshua Rosza, the tourists that Klaus turned, flash on the screen.)  
 Thierry: My guy at the docks is gonna come forward as an eyewitness, saying he saw those two drunkenly fall into the Mississippi. They'll be dredging for weeks. No one will come looking around here.  
 Marcel: That's good, considering one's dead in a dumpster behind the county morgue and the other one is a vampire now. Anything else?  
 (The tailor suddenly pricks her finger on a pin.)  
 Tailor: Ow!  
 Marcel: Allow me, darling.  
 (Marcel crouches down and takes her finger into his mouth, cleaning the blood off.)  
 Thierry: One thing. I sent 4 nightwalkers to look into a werewolf sighting in the Quarter. I haven't heard from them since.  
 Marcel: That makes 10 dead nightwalkers in the last week. You think the werewolves are back in town trying to start some trouble?  
 Thierry: Look, I know you and Klaus are friends, but the fact is, since the Originals showed up—  
 (Klaus arrives.)  
 Klaus: Oh, come now, Thierry. You're not still upset about that little, toxic werewolf bite I gave you, are you? I thought we were at bygones.  
 Thierry: (to Marcel) I see you've given him free rein of your compound now, too.  
 Klaus: Yes. Well, seeing as my family and I lived here, built the place, in fact—  
 Marcel: All right. Come on. You both know the drill. Thierry's my guy, inner circle. Klaus is my old-time friend and sire. He's also a guest here. Peace, all right? All right. (to Klaus) What you need, my brother?  
 Klaus: I'm afraid my sister Rebekah is insisting I demand Elijah's return. She's quite worked up about it. Marcel: I'll say.  
 Thierry: We're not gonna have 3 Originals walking around town, are we? Half our guys think the sister killed the nightwalkers.  
 Klaus: Is that an accusation against an Original?  
 Thierry: Eh.  
 (Klaus goes storms at Thierry, who looks to be ready for a confrontation, but Marcel intercedes.)  
 Marcel: What did I say about peace? (to Klaus) Come on. Walk with me.  
 (Klaus smiles smugly at Thierry as Marcel steers him out of the room. They walk out along the balcony of the building.)  
 Klaus: You inner circle man lacks a sense of humor.  
 Marcel: He's a little overprotective, but loyal to a fault. I saved his life back in the forties, found him dying of a war wound outside a VA hospital. He'd kill for me and die for me. Plus, that boy can play the trumpet like you would not believe. Maybe I'll see if he can play a little tonight at the party. You're coming, right?  
 Klaus: How can I miss my chance to meet the city councilman as he accepts your gigantic charitable donation?  
 Marcel: Oh, he's a schmuck, but he lets us do our thing in exchange for certain community services, like keeping our fangs out of the locals. Listen, about your brother... I would love to help you out, but Thierry is right. My guys are on edge. They see the Original family moving in, vampires dying, it makes them nervous. If I hand Elijah back now, it might give the wrong impression about who's really in charge here. You know what I mean?  
 Klaus: You understand I had to ask.  
 THE FRENCH QUARTER 
 (Rebekah walks through the Quarter, talking on her cell phone. The shots alternate between Rebekah out in the Quarter and Klaus in the cellar of the Mikaelson mansion.)  
 Rebekah: Niklaus, for the love of Mary Magdalene, how long does it take to ask a simple question?  
 Klaus: Much longer than you'd think, considering the answer was, as expected, "no". Marcel's man, Thierry, is suspicious. He thinks you killed 10 nightwalkers.  
 Rebekah: Well, that's a lie. I only killed 8. Should I make Thierry the ninth?  
 Klaus: Marcel is playing friendly. We can't kill the favorite son, or he'll catch onto us. Rebekah: So, war it is, then.  
 Klaus: Indeed. Do you know what to do with the witch?  
 Rebekah: I believe I do. Klaus: Good. You manage Sophie Deveraux. I'll take care of the next step.  
 (Klaus hangs up. He turns to the vampire Joshua, who has been minding Klaus' vampire hostage.)  
 Klaus: I ordered you to drain him of blood. What's taking so long?  
 Joshua: Sorry. I'm not, like, medieval torture expert guy.  
 (Klaus grabs a pitchfork and impales the vampire with it.)  
 Joshua: What did he do to you, anyway?  
 Klaus: It's not about what he did. It's about what he's going to do when we're done here, which is whatever I want him to, just like you. For example, drive this through his torso.  
 (Klaus, having removed the pitchfork from the vampire, compels Joshua and hands the weapon to him. Joshua immediately obeys.)  
 Joshua: That is crazy. I didn't want to do it, but I did it anyway.  
 Klaus: It's called mind compulsion. Vampires can compel humans. Originals, like my siblings and I, can also compel vampires, and no one can compel Originals. You following?  
 (Joshua nods.)  
 Klaus: Good. That is how a brand-new nightwalker such as yourself is here doing my bidding with no one the wiser.  
 Joshua: But I never had my guts drained out of me.  
 Klaus: Yes. That, young Joshua, is because I got to you before you had even a drop of herbal vervain in your system. You see, it prevents compulsion. Marcel has had his whole crew taking it since I returned to town, and that is why our friend here needs to be bled dry of it, so I can compel him to follow my every command. And with my brother currently in captivity awaiting rescue, we can't afford to be gentle about it, can we?  
 (Klaus takes back the pitchfork and runs it into the vampire, twisting it in.)  
 THE FRENCH QUARTER – JARDIN GRIS 
 (Rebekah waits outside the shop and turns to greet Sophie, who is approaching on the sidewalk.)  
 Rebekah: Oh, so glad you could make it. Elijah only lies daggered and rotting whilst you dilly-dally.  
 Sophie: You're lucky I came at all. What do you want?  
 Rebekah: Hayley was attacked last night by Marcel's crew because somebody told him there was a werewolf in the Quarter. She only made one stop. Whoever saw her here ratted her out. Watch and learn.  
 (Rebekah turns and walks into the shop. Sophie follows her in. Inside the shop, Katie emerges from a back room with a box, and sees Sophie.)  
 Katie: Hey, Soph.  
 Sophie: Hey, Katie.  
 (Katie sees Rebekah touching an item hanging in the shop; she doesn't show sign of recognition towards Rebekah.)  
 Katie: That's filled with marigold—great for attracting the opposite s*x. It would look awesome on you.  
 Rebekah: I very seriously doubt that. Do you have any others, one with, say—I don't know—wolfsbane, perhaps?  
 Katie: Wolfsbane? Why would you want that?  
 (Rebekah vamp-runs at Katie, and holds her up by the neck.)  
 Rebekah: Please no not play dumb with me.  
 (Rebekah slams her down on a table.)  
 Sophie: Rebekah!  
 Katie: I just sold a werewolf some herbs. That's all.  
 Rebekah: Are you lying to me, Katie? I suggest you answer my question honestly.  
 Katie: (choking) Sophie—  
 Sophie: Just answer the question, Katie, please.  
 Katie: Yes. I told someone, but you don't understand. I—I love him.  
 (Rebekah throws Katie down onto the floor violently. She places the heel of her stiletto directly over Katie's throat threateningly.)  
 Rebekah: And tell me, who is this vampire Romeo of yours? Shall I count to 3?  
 MIKAELSON MANSION — CELLAR 
 (Klaus pulls the pitchfork out of the vampire and hands it to Joshua.)  
 Klaus: Be quick about it. I have an army to build, and one compelled minion does not an army make.  
 (Klaus answers his phone, which has been buzzing. The shots alternate between Klaus in the cellar and Rebekah in the Quarter.)  
 Klaus: Well?  
 Rebekah: You were right about the traitor. Luckily, she's just a kid and she doesn't know anything about us and what we're up to. Do you want to hear the part that's gonna please you the most?  
 Klaus: Oh, do tell.  
 Rebekah: She's in love with someone in Marcel's inner circle. Guess who it is?  
 Klaus: Right-hand-man type, favors silly caps?  
 Rebekah: Two points for you. Thierry is fraternizing with the enemy.  
 Klaus: Well, that means he just unwittingly became the key to our entire plan.  
 Rebekah: I told you you'd be pleased.  
 Klaus: Oh, to be young and in love in a city where witches and vampires are at war. How very tragic.  
 MIKAELSON MANSION 
 (Hayley eavesdrops from the hallway; Sophie, Rebekah, and Klaus are arguing behind a closed door.)  
 Sophie: Are you out of your mind? No way.  
 Rebekah: It's very simple. We need you to perform a teeny, tiny locator spell to help us find our brother.  
 Sophie: Witches who practice magic in this town get caught, and they get killed.  
 Klaus: Yes, about that. It seems you left out a crucial detail when we made our deal—Marcel's secret weapon, the way he knows when a witch is using magic.  
 Rebekah: Girl about yay high, cute as a button, anger issues.  
 (Sophie seems to be in shock.)  
 Sophie: Davina? Where have you seen her?  
 Rebekah: I don't know. The little brat erased my memory right after she threw me out a window with her bloody mind.  
 Klaus: Let me cut to the chase. Davina has Elijah. You witches, I assume, want to get Davina away from Marcel. We don't know where she is. Ergo, we need magic.  
 Sophie: Davina would sense it.  
 Rebekah: Unless, of course, another witch—say, a traitor to the cause, Katie for example—was to perform much more powerful magic at the same time. That would create a smokescreen, concealing your very small spell from Davina.  
 Sophie: Katie doesn't deserve to die.  
 (Klaus angrily slams his hands on the table and stands up.)  
 Klaus: Sophie Deveraux. You're in no position to be so principled. You can't win a war without a few strategic losses, no matter how regrettable they may be. How many times have the vampires been one step ahead, known something they shouldn't? Your sister, executed in the public square for practicing magic, who knew she'd be caught? Did she even attempt to flee?  
 Sophie: She was caught hiding in a cargo hold of a freighter before it set sail down the Mississippi.  
 Klaus: And who, pray tell, of Marcel's valued inner circle manages his business at the docks?  
 Sophie: Katie's boyfriend, Thierry.  
 THE ABATTOIREdit 
 (Thierry plays his trumpet in the courtyard; Klaus and Marcel watch.)  
 Klaus: You're right. He's good.  
 Marcel: Right? Music man, I call him. Ladies love him, but he's spoken for. He knocks around with this pretty little witch, says he loves her, but I don't know.  
 Klaus: Your brightest soldier is fraternizing with your enemy, and you don't care. Marcel: Well, of course I care, but Thierry is a grown man. He makes his own choices, and I get some good intel. Besides, he's not gonna do anything to jeopardize what we're doing here. I mean, check this out—a vampire hosting a ritzy charity event. We have a community here. No one's gonna mess that up.  
 Klaus: Still... You don't want the witches to get too bold, given that a witch's tip about a werewolf in town led to the disappearance of your nightwalkers. I'm sure you've considered the possibility that it could've been a trap. Marcel: Well, maybe I'll send a little message. Thierry! Take a team of nightwalkers to the Cauldron tonight, do a little rousting... Oh, and Thierry? Make it nasty.  
 THE FRENCH QUARTER – ROUSSEAU'S 
 (Rebekah talks to Cami at the bar.)  
 Rebekah: And so then I moved back here to be closer to my brothers because—let's face it—family's important, right, Camille?  
 Cami: Cami. I have to change this name tag. Drunk guys keep hitting on me in French. You sure you haven't been in here before? Your face looks so familiar.  
 Rebekah: You must have seen me out and about. Aren't you dating Marcel Gerard? He's a pal of mine... sort of. I heard he had a crush on the blonde bartender at Rousseau's.  
 Cami: I would hardly call it dating. He's wooing me... sort of. I don't know. I mean, he's very charming, which probably means I should run for the hills.  
 Rebekah: I'm kind of in an on-again/off-again thing myself at the moment.  
 Cami: Those are the worst, aren't they? The ones you can't shake, even though you know better, and you always know better?  
 Rebekah: I like you, Cami. Most girls have the unfortunate tendency of being whiny little twits.  
 Cami: Thanks... I think. Rebekah: Hey, I'm supposed to go to this posh charity thing thrown by this philanthropist tonight. He's a bit of a Gatsby, throws a mean party. Any interest?  
 (Cami smiles noncommittally, shrugging.)  
 MIKAELSON MANSION 
 (Klaus sits at a desk perusing some papers when his phone starts buzzing. He answers it; the shots alternate between Klaus at the mansion and Rebekah at Rousseau's.)  
 Klaus: Little sister.  
 Rebekah: Well, brother, I believe I've made certain Marcel will be properly distracted tonight.  
 Klaus: Dare I ask?  
 Rebekah: Let's just say his attention will not be on us. I did my bit. What are you doing to ensure Elijah's safe return?  
 Klaus: Currently, I'm preparing insurance against the tender-hearted.  
 Rebekah: Meaning? Klaus: We need proper motivation for Katie to cast a powerful spell tonight. I'm creating that motivation. Marcel has ordered a rousting of the witches.  
 (Cut to the Cauldron, where vampires jump from the balconies causing mayhem and witches scream in response.)  
 Klaus: And I, in turn, have arranged for things to go tragically wrong.  
 (Cut to a flashback from earlier that day—Klaus, in the cellar with Joshua and the vampire.)  
 Klaus: You understand what you're to do? (The vampire nods.) Good.  
 (Back at the Cauldron, vampires continue to upturn tables and destroy things while witches scream. Thierry sneaks off through a back door into Jardin Gris. Katie sees him and runs to greet him with a hug and kiss.)  
 Katie: Hey! What's happening out there?  
 Thierry: Oh, it's Klaus. He's convinced Marcel that the witches are planning to make a move against him. Marcel wants us to send a message...  
 (Thierry knocks over some shelves, looking apologetic.)  
 Thierry: And if he thought I was playing favorites because I'm in love with a witch—  
 Katie: Say that again.  
 Thierry: I love you, Katie. And all this is gonna be okay, I promise.  
 Klaus: (voiceover) Marcel may not be concerned with Thierry's romantic entanglements...  
 (Thierry walks out of the Jardin Gris, bumping into the vampire Klaus tortured and compelled.)  
 Thierry: I already got that one.  
 (Thierry walks away. The vampire goes into the shop anyway. Cut to Klaus at his desk.)  
 Klaus: But there are other crimes which he'll be less inclined to so easily forgive...  
 (Cut to the Cauldron. Thierry hears screams from inside the Jardin Gris. He turns to see the vampire dragging Katie outside, biting her neck as she screams.)  
 Thierry: Leave her alone! Get off!  
 (He throws the vampire across the courtyard; the vampire smashes onto a table. Thierry runs over to him, grabs a broken table leg, and uses it to stake the vampire, killing him. The courtyard goes silent, and the other vampires circle around the scene of the crime.)  
 Klaus: (voiceover) Killing a vampire, for example. That would be unforgivable. If Katie hopes to save her one true love from Marcel's punishment, well, a rescue mission like that will require something positively magical. But then... what's worth dying for, if not love?  
 (At the Cauldron, Katie stares at Thierry, horrified, and Thierry himself looks like he knows the consequences will be dire.)  
 
 
 
 THE ABATTOIR – MASQUERADE GALA 
 (Rebekah and Klaus enter the party, arm in arm, taking in the dark, wild atmosphere. Acrobats perform, dancers handle exotic animals, and confetti falls glittering upon the party guests.)  
 Klaus: Well, this certainly is a fitting backdrop for tonight's events, I must say.  
 (Rebekah and Klaus spot Cami as she enters the party, wearing white angel's wings and a vintage white beaded dress. Rebekah looks pleased, but Klaus' smile falls.)  
 Klaus: What's she doing here?  
 Rebekah: What better way to distract Marcel than to put his very human, new girl in a room chock full of vampires?  
 (Rebekah crosses the courtyard to greet Cami.)  
 Rebekah: Hello, darling. You look precious.  
 (Marcel notices Cami's arrival from a balcony above.)  
 Cami: This party is ridiculous, but I think I [unintelligible] with this dress.  
 (Cami makes eye contact with Klaus, and nods at him.)  
 Cami: Is he the infamous on-again/off-again?  
 Klaus: He's the brother, actually, and my sister is right. You do look stunning.  
 Cami: You clean up pretty well yourself.  
 Klaus: Well, don't be fooled, love. I'm the devil in disguise.  
 Rebekah: You two chit-chat. I need booze.  
 Klaus: Shall we?  
 Cami: Okay.  
 (Klaus offers his arm and Cami takes it. Rebekah approaches the bar.)  
 Rebekah: Scotch, please.  
 (Marcel approaches Rebekah at the bar, and she sighs.)  
 Marcel: You trying to be cute, inviting her here?  
 Rebekah: I think she's darling. I can tell you fancy her pure heart. Perhaps I'll feed it to you.  
 Marcel: Hmm. Jealousy looks good on you, Bekah.  
 (Across the courtyard, Cami and Klaus talk, watching Rebekah with Marcel.)  
 Cami: The guy of hers Rebekah was talking about... I'm sensing that would be Marcel.  
 Klaus: I wouldn't worry about it. Ancient history.  
 Cami: I'm beginning to think your sister is a bit of a bitch.  
 (Klaus laughs.)  
 Klaus: It's as though she invented the term.  
 (Cami gazes at Klaus; he seems drawn in for a moment but catches himself, spotting Marcel getting ready to approach them.)  
 Klaus: Listen. Pardon me for a moment.  
 (Klaus leaves; Marcel greets Cami.)  
 Marcel: Cami.  
 Cami: Hey. Killer party. Marcel: Oh, it's more of a work thing. I would've invited you—  
 Cami: Oh, no. We've been on one date. No explanation necessary. You do your thing, I'll entertain myself.  
 Marcel: What, leave you alone, looking the way you do? Hell with that.  
 MIKAELSON MANSION 
 (Hayley walks around the pool outside. She hears a twig snap nearby, then walks toward the sound to see a wolf staring at her. A voice behind her startles her and she whirls around.)  
 Sabine: You're not supposed to be out here.  
 Hayley: Who are you?  
 Sabine: Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm Sabine. We met. I'm one of Sophie's friends.  
 Hayley: You're one of the witches.  
 Sabine: Sophie just asked me to come keep you company while everyone's out. You know, it's drawn to you.  
 (She nods at where the wolf was standing, and Hayley glances back.)  
 Sabine: The child you're carrying is part vampire, part werewolf. You and Klaus made something special.  
 Hayley: You sound like Elijah. He thinks this baby is going to make us one big, happy family, but now he's gone and I don't even know what... 'it' is.  
 Sabine: You know, I can do something about that, if you want. I mean, found out if it's a boy or girl.  
 Hayley: I thought you couldn't do witchy stuff around here.  
 Sabine: It's not magic, just an old trick my grandmother taught me. Come on. You have to be a little curious.  
 THE ABATTOIR – MASQUERADE GALA 
 (Cami and Marcel dance. Rebekah and Klaus watch them.)  
 Cami: I thought you said you were in community work.  
 Marcel: Community fundraising. Throw a party, folks open their wallets. It's kind of my thing. Guess I'm what you call a necessary evil.  
 Cami: And Rebekah, she's one of your donors?  
 Marcel: She's an old friend.  
 Cami: Can't be that old. She looks younger than me.  
 Marcel: You'd be surprised. I was a kid when I met her. Enough about her. I just want to be right here with you.  
 (Across the courtyard, Klaus and Rebekah have their own conversation.)  
 Klaus: You really are a hideously evil little thing, aren't you?  
 Rebekah: Nonsense. They're perfect for each other. You wanted Marcel distracted—voilà.  
 (Diego enters the courtyard, and sees Marcel dancing with Cami, their faces nearing each other. Diego interrupts them and whispers in Marcel's ear.)  
 Rebekah: (to Klaus) My cue to leave.  
 (Marcel sees Thierry; he looks like he's barely containing his anger.)  
 Marcel: (to Cami) Excuse me.  
 (Marcel walks over to Thierry and grabs him by the throat, pushing him away from the main party. Cami watches, her eyebrows knitting together.)  
 Marcel: What the hell did you do?  
 (Diego intercedes.)  
 Diego: Whoa, not here. No, not here.  
 (Marcel backs off; Klaus smiles; Cami watches, disquiet paralyzing her features.)  
 THE CEMETERY 
 (Katie and Sophie talk inside a candlelit burial chamber. Katie is crying.)  
 Katie: I know you think he's a monster.  
 Sophie: It doesn't matter what I think. Thierry killed another vampire. He broke Marcel's biggest rule. You'll never see him again... unless we do something.  
 Katie: "We"? Sophie: I want to save our people. You want to save Thierry? There's only one way we can do both.  
 (A little while later, Katie and Sophie sit out in the cemetery, arranging items for a ritual.)  
 Sophie: You ready?  
 (Katie begins by sprinkling sand over their tableau. Cut to Davina's attic room, whispering voices growing louder. Davina thrashes, asleep in her bed but disturbed by the magic she can sense.)  
 Davina: Marcel. Something's coming.  
 (Davina rises from her bed and goes to her easel. She draws on the paper madly for several seconds, then stops.)  
 Davina: Magic.  
 THE ABATTOIR — MASQUERADE GALA 
 (Marcel talks to Thierry on a balcony above the party.)  
 Marcel: I want to hear your side of it.  
 Thierry: Hey, Marcel, come on—  
 Marcel: Your version. Go.  
 Thierry: We were tossing the Cauldron. This guy, some nightwalker, he attacked Katie for no reason.  
 Marcel: His name was Max. I turned him, and as far as reasons go, he doesn't need one. She was a witch. He was a vampire. Now he's dead.  
 (From below, Cami watches them.)  
 Thierry: I didn't mean for it to happen.  
 Marcel: You broke my most important rule. Damn it, T. How long we been friends, 70 years? I turned you into something that would never die. I gave you a gift.  
 Thierry: And I have been loyal to you all this time, and I still am. I'm still your friend, Marcel. I swear, that hasn't changed.  
 (Cami's look of apprehension remains. Klaus joins her.)  
 Klaus: Are you all right, love?  
 Cami: He's got a temper, doesn't he? I guess this is the moment I remember I know better.  
 (Cami walks away. Joshua walks up to Klaus, standing slightly behind him. Klaus reaches into his coat's inner pocket, withdraws a folded piece of paper and hands it to Joshua, who pockets it and walks away. Klaus watches the balcony as Joshua appears next to Marcel and hands him the paper.)  
 Joshua: We found this at his girl's place.  
 (Marcel looks at it; it appears to be a spell written out. Marcel turns back to Thierry.)  
 Marcel: Still my friend, huh? That's funny because it looks to me like that little witch of yours got her hands on a spell that I keep locked away.  
 Thierry: Marcel, I have never seen that.  
 Marcel: Shut up. I see on your hand, you still have the daylight ring I gave you. So what would you need with the recipe for making new ones? Unless maybe you and Katie were gonna go off and start a little kingdom of your own?  
 Thierry: Marcel, no.  
 Marcel: Here's a lesson in friendship. Friends don't lie to me, they don't break my rules, and they do not steal what is mine.  
 (Marcel turns to take a moment and breathe, then returns to Thierry.)  
 Marcel: Ohh... For the crime of murdering one of his own, I sentence Thierry Vanchure to 100 years in the Garden.  
 (Below, Klaus smiles.)  
 Klaus: And it begins...  
 (Sophie is at the cemetery, preparing her locator spell, when Rebekah appears. Sophie looks up when she hears her.)  
 Rebekah: You're doing the right thing. It's the only way to find Elijah.  
 Sophie: I'm doing what I have to do.  
 (Sophie begins chanting.)  
 (Klaus watches as more of Marcel's men lead Thierry out of the party and out onto the street, where a small crowd of more vampires watch Katie approach from down the street, chanting. Klaus watches the events unfold from a window above. The sequence is intercut with shots of Davina madly scribbling at her easel.)  
 Thierry: Katie, no!  
 Klaus: Like clockwork.  
 (Katie waves her arm and a lamp's light explodes; all the vampires grab at their heads, falling down in pain. Davina's drawing appears to be Katie's face. Marcel alone rises back up to face Katie, but she smashes another light with magic and Marcel goes down again. Sophie continues to chant for her spell.)  
 Rebekah: Hurry.  
 (Marcel rises again, but Katie uses magic to break his bones, and he falls again shouting in pain.)  
 Davina: NO!  
 (In her attic room, Davina lifts her hands slowly; Marcel again rises, and Katie looks astonished.)  
 Marcel: You're here to save your man. Well, come on, little girl!  
 (He growls as he runs to attack Katie, but she halts him with magic, and he falls down groaning. Davina in her room falls at the same time. Katie lifts a wooden stake above Marcel.)  
 Katie: Die, you son of a bitch.  
 Thierry: No! Katie! Don't!  
 (Klaus swoops in and snaps Katie's neck. She falls to the ground, dead. In the cemetery, Sophie stops her spell.)  
 Sophie: Something's wrong. Katie's magic stopped. I can keep going.  
 Rebekah: You can't. She'll sense it.  
 Sophie: No. I can find Davina. I just need another moment.  
 (Rebekah grabs the paper with black sand on top of it that Sophie was using and throws it aside.)  
 Rebekah: You may be willing to die to get your witch back, but Hayley and the baby will die with you. Elijah will never forgive us, and rescuing him will be for nothing. It's over. We failed.  
 (Back on the street, Thierry crawls over to Katie's body.)  
 Thierry: No. Katie. No, no, no, no.  
 (He sobs over her body, cradling it. Marcel catches Klaus' eye, and nods.)  
 (Thierry stands chained to a wall in some underground room. Marcel stands across from him.)  
 Marcel: Just tell me this. Was she worth it?  
 Thierry: I loved her.  
 (Marcel drives an iron stake into Thierry's gut, and he groans in pain. Another man appears, and Marcel hands him a wooden mallet.)  
 Marcel: Seal him up... and let him rot.  
 (The man begins to lay bricks over wet cement, clearly intending to build a wall to encase Thierry. He won't be the first; a long view down the tunnel suggests that many others have met the same fate.)  
 (The party is over and the courtyard is deserted. Klaus and Marcel stand alone on a balcony and clink their drinks against each other. Marcel downs his.)  
 Marcel: How much did Cami see?  
 Klaus: She just saw an argument, mate. It's nothing you can't fix. You really like her, don't you?  
 Marcel: I like that she's not a part of any of this. Sometimes it's good to see the world the way the humans do.  
 Klaus: I am sorry about Thierry, you know? I can tell he was a good friend.  
 Marcel: I made him what he was. Obviously, my trust was misplaced.  
 Klaus: Doesn't make it easier. Marcel: You saved me tonight. I guess I owe you one. You asked for your brother back. Seems like the least I can do.  
 (Cami drinks a pint at a bar, still wearing her gala finery. Klaus enters the place and sits next to her.)  
 Klaus: Cami—  
 Cami: Don't even try it. I get the bro code. You're here to smooth things over for your friend. It's very nice of you, but—  
 Klaus: But you've been hurt before, and you aren't taking any more chances.  
 Cami: Something like that. The guy I saw tonight—not the guy I thought he was. And if he can turn on a dime like that—  
 Klaus: Sounds like more than just a broken heart. Someone broke your trust. Camille, the brave bartender.  
 (Cami and Klaus stare at each other. Cami swallows, looking like she might lean in, but Klaus blinks and breaks the moment.)  
 Klaus: I'm sorry... But I need you to give Marcel another chance.  
 (Cami clears her throat.)  
 Cami: Wow. I totally misread that.  
 Klaus: No. You read it quite well, but we all have our roles to play. (compels) You went to Marcel's. You danced. You feel badly that he had a row with his friend, but otherwise, all you remember is that it was perfect.  
 (Rebekah sits at the piano, playing a scattering of notes lazily. Klaus enters and she sits up.)  
 Rebekah: Well, tonight was an epic failure.  
 Klaus: On the contrary, sister. Tonight was a masterpiece.  
 Rebekah: Are you mad? Katie died before Sophie could complete the spell.  
 Klaus: Oh, I'm well aware. I killed Katie.  
 Rebekah: You what?  
 Klaus: There's no way our little suicide witch wasn't gonna try and take out Marcel with her. I saved his life, and in doing so, I now have him exactly where I want him.  
 Rebekah: Sophie trusted you. I trusted you against all my better instincts.  
 Klaus: Wake up, Rebekah. The witches are on no one's side but their own. This girl, Davina? That's all they want, and when they have her, what do you think happens then, a truce? Of course not. They will use Davina's power against all of us.  
 Rebekah: Even if you're right, the plan was to find Elijah, and you've failed us.  
 Klaus: You always did lack faith. By protecting Marcel, I've cemented his trust, so much so that he's agreed to return Elijah to us. And when the time is right, when he has told me everything I need to know about Davina, I will have her for myself.  
 Rebekah: I have all the faith in the world that you'll get what you want, Nik. You always do, no matter what is costs the rest of us. You disgust me.  
 (Rebekah takes a sip of bourbon, then sets it on the piano and leaves.)  
 (Davina kneels at Elijah's open casket. She hears a door open and looks up to see Marcel enter. She runs to hug him.)  
 Davina: You're okay! I was so worried.  
 Marcel: Thank you. Whatever you did, I felt it. You helped me.  
 Davina: It was the old ones, wasn't it?  
 Marcel: Actually, Klaus is the one that saved me tonight. I'm gonna make things right, starting off by giving him his brother back.  
 Davina: No.  
 Marcel: What? Davina— Davina: No. You said the old ones were dangerous. I won't give him back until I know how to kill them.  
 MIKAELSON MANSION  
 (Hayley sits typing on a laptop at a desk, on whose top lay open a few old texts. Klaus pauses at the doorway and walks in.)  
 Klaus: I thought you might like to know, Elijah is returning to us.  
 Hayley: Congratulations. I guess being diabolical has its perks.  
 Klaus: You hardly know him, and yet you miss him. What is it about my brother that always inspires such instant admiration?  
 Hayley: He was kind to me.  
 (Klaus takes this in. Elijah speaks in voiceover.)  
 Elijah: (voiceover) There are moments when I doubt my family is capable of redemption...  
 (Klaus turns to leave.)  
 Hayley: Hey, I learned something today. I think it's a girl.  
 (Klaus pauses in the doorway, but doesn't turn round. He smiles slowly.)  
 Elijah: (voiceover) Yet each time that I am tempted to surrender, I see it, the glimmer of goodness that allows me to believe.  
 THE FRENCH QUARTER 
 (Rebekah is walking in the Quarter, still wearing her gown but her hair slightly disheveled. She sees Marcel, and turns the other way but runs into him there.)  
 Rebekah: You're following me.  
 (He walks toward her, backing her up against a store front.)  
 Marcel: Maybe you're just in my way.  
 (He walks away. Rebekah shuts her eyes.)  
 THE CEMETERY 
 (Katie's body lies prepared for her final rites. Sophie waves a smoking bundle of herbs over her body. Other witches, including Agnes and Sabine, stand around her.)  
 Agnes: I told you no good would come from this unholy alliance of yours.  
 Sophie: At least I'm doing something. What about you?  
 (Sophie leaves.)  
 Agnes: Sabine, tell them what you saw.  
 Sabine: It's the girl, the wolf.  
 FLASHBACK 
 (Sabine swings a crystal, hanging by a string, over Hayley, who lies on the kitchen island face up.)  
 Sabine: I think it's a girl. No... wait.  
 Hayley: Wait what? Please tell me I'm not having a mini-Klaus.  
 (The crystal glints in the light and Sabine drops it, gasping, her eyes rolling back in her head.)  
 Sabine: Hoc est infantima malom. Nos omnia perditu el eam.  
 (Flash forward to Hayley sitting at the desk with her laptop. She's entering the strange words Sabine uttered into an online translator, but is getting no results.)
