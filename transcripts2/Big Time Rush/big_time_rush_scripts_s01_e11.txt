 [All chatting and singing] 
 [All sniffing] 
 All: I smell party! 
 Oh, yeah. 
 What's going on? 
 Together: Please tell us it's a party. 
 It is the Big-Time Rush party celebrating the making the making of your first album. 
 [All cheering] 
 No. 
 You're not invited. 
 All: What? Why? 
 One, it's a classy party for executives only. 
 Two, I don't need dogs around playing with their food. 
 Together: We don't play with food. 
 James and Carlos, turn around. 
 [Both growling] 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 How can you have a Big-Time Rush party without Big-Time Rush? 
 You'll be here in spirit, and in cut-out form. 
 Well, we're staying. 
 Fine. 
 All: Fine. 
 Fine! 
 You can stay. 
 But do not go in my super party fun box. 
 [All gasping] 
 I can't believe we fell for that.

 Hey. I'm taking Katie on a day trip; we'll be back late. 
 We're going to Vegas. 
 San Diego. 
 But I get to drive. 
 Hey, mom, would you mind... 
 No parties. 
 It's a Palmwoods rule. 
 And if I get another strike, bitters kicks us out, remember? 
 [All screaming] 
 Organizing a Palmwoods-wide extreme pillow fight, strike one. 
 [Buzz!] 
 [Growling] 
 Putting a giant octopus in the Palmwoods pool, strike two. 
 [Buzz!] 
 All: Right. 
 But did he have to put them on our door? 
 Be good. 
 I mean it. 
 We have to throw a party. We're teenagers. 
 If we don't party, we could die. 
 Party, party! 
 We can't party at the Palmwoods. 
 But there's nothing saying we can't have a "get-together." 
 Ooh. 
 Or a social gathering. 
 Together: Social gathering! 
 Social gathering! 
 James, Carlos, you two transform 2-j into a cool club atmosphere. 
 And get some snacks and sodies. 
 And we keep the guest list short, say, three people each, which is not a party, but a get-together. 
 Together: Get-together! Get-together! 
 And I'm gonna go down to the pool right now and invite Jo, 'cause I kind of got a thing for her. 
 Wow, thanks for the thing. 
 So we're having a small gathering get-together tonight. 
 You mean a party? 
 Shh! 
 It's not a party! 
 Anyways, I was wondering if you would be my guest friend person thing? 
 You mean your date. 
 That's a term that could also be used. 
 So you want me to be your guest friend person thing at your non-party? 
 It's gonna be super fun, and it starts at 7:00. 
 Oh! 
 What's super fun and starts at 7:00? 
 Marbles. 
 We're going to play marbles. 
 [Buzz!]

 guys, it's just a small gathering get-together. 
 Dude. We're not in Minnesota anymore. This is the big leagues. 
 Our big-time Hollywood party cred starts tonight. 
 We start small, but you start hot. 
 Sss. 
 And before you know it, we'll be known as the Hollywood super party kings of Hollywood. 
 Together: Whoo, whoo! 
 You said Hollywood twice. 
 You bet I did. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Go, go, go. 
 Welcome to the get-together. 
 Snacks to the left. 
 Dance floor is straight ahead, and good times all around. 
 Together: Nice! 
 Hey, where's Logan? 
 And you can find Kendall thataway. 
 Thank you. 
 Wow, v.I.P. Area. 
 Am I on the list? 
 Actually, you're the only one. 
 [Glass shatters] 
 [Electronic beeping] 
 Is it hot in here, or is it just you? 
 Um, no, it's hot in here. I was just making pizza bagels. 
 [Crashing] 
 Are you preparing for a movie role? 
 Yes. 
 And it's called... 
 You are mine tonight. 
 And it's starring me 
 ... and you. 
 Um, I'm gonna be right back. 
 So you stay here. 
 This is nice, being alone with you... 
 And Logan. 
 Camille's all over me and says we're in a movie together. 
 Yay! 
[Chuckles nervously] 
 Help. 
 What's the problem? 
 Camille's cool. 
 You have to ad she's kind of crazy. 
 Oh, like your friends are normal? 
 [Crashing, glass shattering] 
 Logan, just tell her that you're not interested and you want to be friends. 
 Or just relax and see where it goes. 
 I mean, maybe starring in Camille's fantasy movie could be fun. 
 Is it hot in here, or is it just you? 
 [Screaming] 
 [Grunting and screaming] 
 It's just me. 
 Wha, hi-ya! 
 Yeah, a cool movie. 
 Thanks, Jo. 
 Kendall, you were totally wrong. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 ♪ what's up, what's up, what's up! ♪ 
 guitar dude! 
 All right, everybody's here. 
 Let's social gather! 
 Whoo! 
 Ooo, ooo! 
 [Bright orchestral music] 
 Great party, Gustavo. 
 So when does it start? 
 Uh, a half hour ago. 
 No, it didn't. 
 I come to your little music shop because it's funky, happening. 
 But tonight, I'd rather watch a Dutchman make molasses. 
 [Crashing] 
 I've been working on this party for three weeks. 
 Cool. 
 But right now, Fujizaki, your company's founder, is asleep. 
 [Snoring] 
 And I'm going to play games on my phone. 
 [Crashing] 
 Hey, we got to liven this party up before Fujizaki literally dies of boredom. 
 [Coughing] 
 [Gasping] 
 His eyes are open. 
 Oh, he's alive. 
 Move it! 
 Okay. 
 So I think our non-date at this... 
 ... Not-party is going very nicely. 
 I agree. 
 Clink! 
 So you like hockey? 
 I hate hockey. 
 [Wet splattering] 
 [Coughing violently] 
 So where were we? 
 Well, I was here. 
 Where have you been? 
 Oh, just a little hosting emergency. But I'm here now. 
 And you have my undivided attention. 
 I'll... 
 ... Be right back. 
 Why don't you talk to guitar dude? 
 [Groaning] 
 Mercedes! 
 [Gasps] 
 What are you doing here? 
 Carlos invited me and you're my new boyfriend, remember? 
 I... 
 Let's go. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Together: Welcome to the... 
 [Screaming] 
 [Crowd cheering] 
 [Glass shatters] 
 [All screaming] 
 Excuse me, pardon me. 
 Who invited all of these people? 
 I don't know. 
 I only invited the three hottest girls in my phone. 
 And I couldn't decide, so I texted the first three people in my phone. 
 Abigail Aaron, Andrea Adams, and Al contacts. 
 It says "all contacts." 
 You invited your whole phone? 
 [People screaming] 
 All: Oh, this is bad. 
 [Sniffing] 
 I smell party. 
 Who's getting a strike tonight? 
 [Buzz!] 
 This was supposed to be a small gathering, and now it's an uncontrollable party that gets us kicked out of the Palmwoods. 
 
 
 
 Opa! 
 Sergei, you made it. 
 Opa! 
 Together: Hey! 
 You have Russian acrobats in your contact list? 
 [Crowd cheering] 
 I'm a people person. 
 Emergency party plan. 
 I'm gonna go get my date, who doesn't like hockey... 
 I know, right? 
 And go downstairs, keep an eye on bitters so we don't get our third strike, while you guys get rid this party. 
 Together: Right. On it. 
 We can't stop a party this good. 
 We won't be party kings. 
 We'll be party killers. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Teenagers should not have to make decisions like this. 
 I've got a huge problem. 
 There are two girls at this party who are in love with me. 
 Got it. Now, what's the problem? 
 Dude, two girls have a crush on you at the same time? 
 This is not a problem. 
 This is the best party of your life. 
 Together: Think about it. 
 Is it hot in here, or is it just you? 
 [Screaming] 
 [Grunting and screaming] 
 Actually, it's me. 
 You're mine tonight. 
 No, he's mine! 
 No, he's mine! 
 No, he's mine! 
 No, he's mine! 
 He's mine! 
 I think I see what you mean. 
 Together: I don't think you do. 
 Excuse me. 
 Pardon me. 
 Hey. 
 Do you like ice dancing, bubble tea, and romantic vampire novels? 
 No, no, and let's talk about it on the way down to the lobby. 
 Hey, have you seen Logan? 
 Sure, lots of times. 
 Hey there. 
 Miss me? 
 So, Logey, it's been a whole week since I made you my boyfriend, and it's time we start thinking about our one-year anniversary. 
 Shh. 
 Let's just enjoy this moment right here. 
 Okay, got to go. 
 So we've been neighbors for three months now, and I feel like I barely even know you. 
 Well, let me tell you about myself. 
 Shh. 
 Let's just enjoy this moment together. 
 I got to go. I'll be right back. 
 Do you like ballet dancing, fine arts, or Scandinavian cheese? 
 I like slam dancing, lawn darts, and cheese puffs. 
 This date isn't going we, is it? 
 [Elevator dings] 
 And it just got worse. 
 [Electronic buzzing] 
 Don't you have two strikes on your door? 
 We're dead. 
 Sure, Kendall, I'd love to go to that party on the fourth floor. 
 Looks like it's time for bitters to crash the party. 
 [Honking and banging noises] 
 James, bitters is roaming the hall now looking for our party. 
 Did you get everyone out of the apartment? 
 We're working on it. 
 Are you on the dance floor? 
 I can't hear you. We're dancing into a tunnel. 
 He hung up? 
 Yep. 
 Kendall says that bitters is on the hunt for our amazingly incredible super party. 
 What do we do? 
 Whoo. Ooo. 
 Whoo. Ooo. 
 Whoo. Ooo. Whoo. Ooo. 
 Ooo, ooo, ooo! 
 [Yawning] 
 [Snoring] 
 Where is the exciting entertainment I told you to get? 
 The Russian acrobats cancelled. 
 They're at some amazing party everybody's talking about. 
 Ooh, that's too bad. 
 Fujizaki loves his Russian acrobats. 
 [Gasping] 
 [Claps hands] 
 Opa! 
 [Crashing] 
 [Coughing] 
 Opa! 
 [Crashing] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 [Screaming] 
 [Crashing] 
 Opa? 
 I can't believe you work for this guy. 
 These aren't even the real boys. 
 Okay, everyone out! The party's over. 
 I can't believe the Hollywood super party kings of Hollywood actually got rid of the party. 
 Ah. 
 Now to just turn off this music. 
 [Music continues] 
 Uh, Kendall, you might want to see this. 
 [Jumping dance music] 
 [Party horns blowing] 
 I told you to get rid of everybody. 
 No, you said to get everybody out of the apartment. 
 And we did. 
 Ooo, ooo! 
 There's my muffin loaf. 
 You know, I think my combination of looks and wealth deserves a little more attention. 
 You're right. I'll get you some chips. 
 This party is amazing. 
 I could stay here all night. 
 Me too. 
 You want some punch? 
 I'll get you some punch. 
 Hello, my puka shell. 
 Would you like some dip? 
 I would like you to sit down and spend some time with me. 
 Mm, mm-hmm. 
 That was great. 
 I'll get that dip. 
 Here's your punch, me lady. 
 Oh! 
 Is it hot in here, or is it just me? 
 [Laughs] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Splashing] 
 Okay, Logan's in the pool. 
 James and Carlos think they're the kings of party land. 
 And bitters is not gonna stop until he finds a party to bust. 
 Then I guess we should give him a party to bust. 
 [Music stops] 
 [All groaning] 
 [Jumping dance music] 
 No party. 
 No party. 
 No party. 
 [Screeching] 
 [Party horn wailing] 
 Party. 
 [Dance music] 
 Run. 
 [Party horn wailing] 
 Won't be long now. 
 [Crash!] 
 It's official. 
 I threw the worst party ever. 
 It's not that bad. 
 [Snoring] 
 That's it. 
 I was wrong. 
 I'm calling the dogs so they can liven things up. 
 [Phone trilling] 
 Hollywood super party kings of Hollywood. 
 Party king speaking. 
 Carlos, get the boys over here now. 
 No can do, Gustavo. 
 We're having the greatest party of our lives. 
 [Crowd cheering] 
 You crazy Russian acrobats. 
 Put me down! 
 Got to go, Gustavo. 
 Whoo! 
 [Crowd cheering] 
 So are they coming? 
 No. 
 And I think we just found out where the amazing party is. 
 Listen up! 
 Everybody on the party bus. 
 We're heading to the Palmwoods! 
 [All cheering] 
 Ooo, ooo! 
 [Party horn blaring] 
 [Cheering] 
 You know, we're gonna laugh about this some day. 
 I'm laughing about it now. 
 Party! 
 Aha! 
 [Muffled music] 
 [Electronic buzzing] 
 ♪ you know I'll agree ♪ 
♪ turn your whole world around ♪ 
 hey, it's just an empty... 
 [Locks clicking] 
 [Both sighing] 
 So what do we do now? 
 We party. 
 [Bouncing dance music] 
 Together: Opa! 
 Now, this is a party. 
 Whoop, whoop! 
 [Coughing] 
 Whoop, whoop! 
 Whoop, whoop, indeed, Gustavo. 
 Whoop, whoop, indeed. 
 Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get funky.

 Hey, you're cute. 
 You're my new boyfriend. 
 Cool. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 I was a jerk. 
 You're really mad at me, right? 
 Oh, big-time. 
 In fact, I've decided that I'm not talking to you for one whole week. 
 But we can still dance. 
 You're really cool. 
 You know that? 
 Shh. 
 No talking. 
 [Mouthing] Okay. 
 [Upbeat dance music] 
 So we do have things in common: Tricking building managers, dancing, and hockey. 
 Yes, yes, and still no.
