 I will x-pediate their training And have them x-ready. 
 Great, now, let's move on To the hard part of your training. 
 Awesome. 
 Right on. 
 Run! 
 Hiding's not gonna solve anything. 
 No, but it will temporarily keep us alive, And I don't know about you, But I like living! 
 I thought training was kind of fun. 
 That's your concussion talking. 
 Look, guys, Gustavo might be loud, mean, Obnoxious, self-absorbed... Unattractive. 
 Get to the point. 
 Put it in hocy y terms. 
 In two weeks we have the biggest game of our lives. 
 We have to train our butts off for it, or we could lose. 
 No matter how rough the first period was, We have to get back on the ice. 
 Ah! 
 Hey, Gustavo wants... We're coming. We're coming. 
 Really? 
 Oh, well... One of you guys want a ride back to the stage? 
 Ooh, I'll take one. 
 You're ironing? 
 I'm impressed. 
 It's a prototype Of my big time rush concert merchandise. 
 Kendall texted me about the big concert tour, And I plan on cashing in. 
 Oh, honey, the record company. 
 Owns the rights to all that stuff. 
 You can't just sell big time rush gear. 
 Yes, I can. It's called bootlegging. 
 I'm gonna sell posters too. 
 How did you get like this? 
 I never dropped you, not once. 
 Mom, I'm putting my life savings into this, And with the standard 
500% concert mark-up, I could make 20 grand. 
 I want 75% of all profits going into your college fund. 
 Yes! 
 Order is placed, and you are the best mom ever. 
 Yeah, I don't know about that. 
 Okay, time for fan preparedness training. 
 With the number one teen idol, Dak zevon. 
 Guys, fans are your friends, But they can also be frenzied, Which is why lesson one Proper fan interaction, Or p'fie. 
 Okay, now, observe carefully. 
 How I demonstrate the mosh pit hand slap. 
 Okay, James, now you try it. 
 All right. 
 Yeah, James! 
 Let's go, James! 
 Oh, no, James! 
 That was wrong. 
 We'll find James later. 
 Now you guys try it. 
 And remember, slap the hands quickly. 
 Excellent. 
 Yes. 
 My underwear is gone. 
 Now, security guards will protect you From 99% of the crowd, But 1% of your fan base will be insane and get to you. 
 Ah! 
 I love you! 
 I love you! I love you! 
 You're bigger than her! 
 What Kendall should have done there is duck. 
 Uh, your feet are too close to the edge. 
 What? 
 What? 
 Wah! 
 Hey, honey, I'm back from... The... Gym. 
 Over here, mom! 
 It is amazing how fast you can get product in this town. 
 What is this? 
 It's cheaper to buy inululk. 
 And if you stop yelling, I'll put 80% of the profits into my college fund. 
 I'm not gonna yell. 
 Instead, I'm going to get an aspirin... 
 To stop the headache that will be arriving in about one minute. 
 Katie! 
 Boys, I am proud of you. 
 U! Get out of here! 
 I love you, Kendall! 
 I love you! 
 Marry me! 
 This concert is gonna take btr To the next level. 
 And you have your first dress rehearsal in three days. 
 And we want you to invite. 
 All of your friends from the palmwoods. 
 So you can practice your stage swagger. 
 So you're gonna drive us back to the palmwoods, right? 
 No. 
 A concert can last two hours, And you'll need more endurance. 
 Than a marathon runner carrying a cow. 
 Which is why you'll be running back to the palmwoods, Carrying these microphones. 
 Move, move, move it! 
 ♪ ah, ah, ah-ah, oh ♪ 
 Ho-ho! 
 ♪ ah, ah, ah-ah, oh ♪. 
 So what did you find out? 
 They have their first concert in two weeks. 
 Gustavo's training them, And rocque records has a better coffee maker than we do. 
 Don't worry. Gustavo will slip up. 
 And when he does, Hawk will descend upon his prey. 
 Caw! Caw! 
 Added a second "caw." 
 I'd stick with one. 
 Are you guys gonna make it The next two weeks to your concert? 
 Ah! 
 Uh! 
 Yep. And it's gonna rock! 
 And you and all the palmwoods. 
 Are invited to our dress rehearsal. 
 Cool. 
 We're v.I.P.S. 
 Someday we'll be able to say we knew them when. 
 Hey, someday is today. 
 I have dreamed about this for so long. 
 And it's finally gonna happen. 
 I love you! 
 I love you, I love you, I love you! 
 Don't worry about that. 
 It's part of our training. 
 What are you doing?

 Bravo. Bravo! 
 Watching you boys go from nobodies to somebodies. 
 Has been more thrilling than hunting humans, Which is why it hurts me to say. 
 The album, tour, and this concert... Are cancelled. 
 What? 
 What? 
 What? 
 What? 
 What? 
 What? 
 I mean yeah. 
 Big time rush is dead. 
 What do you mean the band is dead? 
 Accounting has just released their risk and feasibility. 
 Report on big time rush, And they decided it's too risky. 
 And not feasible. 
 Oh! 
 We're shifting our strategy to children's books on tape. 
 No tour support is required. 
 They have a higher profit margin And are super cheap to make. 
 Which is why tomorrow Gustavo will be producing. 
 Can you foo? 
 As read by actor-environmentalist Ed begley Jr. 
 But, Griffin, this is our someday. 
 Close. It's your last day. 
 Sorry, fellas, I like you; I do. 
 But as we say in business... That's business. 
 You can't do this! 
 We've been working our butts off! 
 Our concert is in one week. 
 Don't worry. 
 That's why I'm giving all of you... Frfruit baskets. 
 Great, I just spent 3,000 bucks. 
 Making t-shirts, posters, and hats. 
 On a band that doesn't even exist. 
 I'll take a hat. 
 It'll be a nice memory of what almost was. 
 That'll be $3,000. 
 James, the moving van is coming. 
 You have to come out of the bathroom. 
 I am dreaming. 
 You are not real. 
 Ha! The concert's in a week! 
 Classic denial response. 
 It's sad, really. 
 Katie, you need to pack your things. 
 I'm dreaming. You're not real! 
 The concert's in one week! 
 I know this town crushes dreams. 
 But not when they're so close to coming true. 
 I'm really gonna miss all this. 
 And I'm also gonna miss... I mean... You know, uh... 
 I'm not good at good-byes. 
 Well, then, here's somththing to remember me by. 
 Wow. 
 She's really good at good-byes. 
 I never thought that our first kiss would be our last. 
 Do I get something to remember  you  by? 
 Of course. 
 I just can't believe we're going back to Minnesota. 
 Okay... Now I believe it. 
 This dream is so real. 
 This totally looks like Minnesota! 
 Kendall, you're back. 
 Can you take the afternoon shift? 
 I... 
 Great. 
 No! 
 Do you foo? 
 I know I can foo. 
 Let's see if you can foo too. 
 Aaaahhh! 
 Good job, ed. 
 Let's take five and... 
 Play with some of those toys I put in the booth for you. 
 You know, you didn't even tell them good-bye. 
 I... Didn't know what to say. 
 How about that you care about them. 
 And you'll do something to fix this? 
 I can't do anything. 
 I'm under contract with rcm/cbt/globalnet losers. 
 To produce albums. 
 I can do this. 
 I'm amazing. 
 Ed! 
 All right, great job. 
 Let's try page two. 
 You can. 
 You can foo. 
 But can you foo roo the boo moo goo? 
 I miss the guys so much! 
 Aaahhh! 
 Me too! 
 I miss them. 
 T-shirts! 
 Get your big time rush t-shirts! 
 It's also good for cleaning rags and organic dog food. 
 Katie... Not helping. 
 Yeah. But the pool display is. 
 Whoo! 
 Whoo! 
 If you close your eyes And Carlos splashes water on you, It's like you're still at the palmwoods. 
 We have got to keep the band going. 
 We'll keep rehearsing and get back to L.A. 
 We cannot give up. 
 We're not giving up. 
 We're moving on. 
 And I'm not gonna waste A perfectly good day of my life. 
 Feeling sorry for myself. 
 None of us should. 
 I smell speech. 
 Logan, was it your dream to be a Hollywood pop star. 
 Or a doctor? 
 A doctor. 
 Then call up that prep school. 
 You say all the doctors come from And get an interview. 
 Good speech so far. 
 And, Carlos, what was your dream? 
 To be hit by a radioactive meteor And fight crime as... 
 Meteor man. 
 Okay. We can work on that. 
 Those dreams are stupid! 
 And you're stupid, because Gustavo's coming back. 
 Coming back? 
 He didn't even say good-bye. 
 Look around, James. 
 There's nobody pulling up in a shiny car. 
 Offering to make our dreams come true. 
 Kendall knight? 
 Yes? 
 I'm the athletic director at Minnesota university. 
 And this is an invitation To skate with the team this Saturday. 
 This is the golden gopher High School all-star skate. 
 How did you... - Your mom told me I could find you here. 
 And I hope to see you there. 
 This parking lot has been very good to me. 
 You are all quitters. 
 Big time rush is not dead! 
 Oh... 
 Give me the rundown. 
 Logan Mitchell, the smart one, Which means he'll ask questions. 
 Kendall knight, the complete package, But strong-headed, hard to control. 
 Carlos Garcia, high energy, a good dancer, But wears a helmet for no apparent reason. 
 James diamond, extra pretty, solid voice, Driven beyond belief. 
 I knew Gustavo would slip up. 
 Now the Hawk will swoop in and catch his prey. 
 Caw-caw! 
 Really? 
 Well, I'm liking the double caw. 
 Let's all rubby dubby In the flubby wubby tubby. 
 Gustavo, should I put the emphasis On "rubby" or "flubby"? 
 You know, ed, just do whatever you want. 
 All right? Just go nuts. 
 Finally, a director I can work with. 
 Flubby rubby du-[. 
 Give me the rundown. 
 Okay, according to the research, Griffin spent $2 million on big time rush. 
 So it's gonna cost $2 million to buy them back. 
 $2 million? 
 Where am I gonna get $2 million? 
 I've assessed all of rocque records' assets, And I think I figured out a way we can do it. 
 Oh, oh, this is great! This is great. 
 Come by my mansion later tonight, And we will figure everything out. 
 Yeah, you're gonna have to sell your mansion. 
 Okay, I think I finally got this place cleaned up. 
 Ugh, Katie, donate these t-shirts and posters to charity! 
 I will not donate my life savings. 
 Okay, what's on day three. 
 Of our "rebuild our Minnesota dreams" schedule? 
 10:00 A.M.: Get doctor's coat For interview at crestview. 
 Done. 
 Super Carlos arrives. 
 Never fear! 
 Meteor man is here! 
 It works. 
 But you can't use meteor man. 
 There was a movie in the '9os. 
 How about... Asteroid boy? 
 Catchy. 
 Yes, but will it work when you're 35? 
 Gugh, it's got to be space-rock-themed, okay? 
 Now, doctor dude, hockey boy, We must right what we wronged in Minnesota. 
 When we left this great land for the Western Metropolis. 
 We are so sorry. 
 We... we know we let you down, but we're back, And we nt to make it up to you. 
 I don't need my walkway shoveled now. 
 I needed it last winter, when you boys promised. 
 What else can we do? Name it. 
 Well, my lawn needs mowing. 
 We'll be here first thing in the morning, Mrs. Majakowski. 
 We promise. 
 And put this on my car. 
 I can't drive anymore. 
 I have to take the bus now. 
 It's the car that started it all. 
 We drove James to that audition with Gustavo In this car. 
 And now he's not talking to us. 
 What do you think James is up to right now? 
 Oh, riding around town, Waiting for fame and fortune to hit. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Ugh. 
 James diamond? 
 The name's Hawk. 
 Caw! 
 This application asks what my biggest weakness is. 
 You can be indecisive. 
 Right, I'll put that. 
 Wait, no, should I? 
 I mean, yes, I could put it, But I don't even know if I want to put that. 
 Weak bladder. 
 Ho-oh! 
 How about comet dude? 
 Eh... 
 Hello. 
 I'm putting the bad back together. 
 And we're doing the concert. 
 Yes! 
 So... What do you say, guys? 
 You want to come back to L.A. 
 And take one more shot at the big time? 
 No. 
 Gustavo, we're tired of being pushed around. 
 We're gonna be a band. We're not gonna be a band. 
 What you want. What Griffin doesn't want. 
 I want a hockey scholarship. 
 I want to b be a doctor. 
 And I want to make the world a safer place. 
 You didn't even say good-bye. 
 I'm not good at good-byes! 
 But I believe in you. 
 And you've taught me things, Other things that... I'm not good at, Like friendship and loyalty... And family. 
 Can I... can I stop now? 
 You're doing great. 
 If we go back, Our album will be released, right? 
 Once people see your concert, Everything else will fall into place. 
 I'm almost positive. 
 So you want us to pack up everything, again, For a concert that may or may not launch our album. 
 So we got a deal? 
 Yep. 
 Yes! 
 Yes! 
 Okay. 
 Let's get James. 
 
 
 
 Yeah, sorry, guys. 
 James left an hour ago for L.A. 
 With a producer named, uh... Hawk. 
 No! 
 Water. Thank you. 
 No! 
 We are back! 
 Now, all we have to do is find James, Tell him the band's back together, and... 
 Oh, my gosh, the studio's been robbed! 
 [gasps] this looks like a job for... 
 El hombre del flaming space rock man. 
 Not even a little. 
 The studio wasn't robbed. 
 I had to sell everything. 
 To buy big time rush back from Griffin, Including... my mansion. 
 Oh, Kelly! 
 Don't worry, Gustavo. 
 We won't let you down. 
 And you can stay with us at the palmwoods. 
 Yeah, there's no money for the palmwoods. 
 Then where are we staying? 
 Ehhhh. 
 Welcome to the rocquewoods. 
 It's not much, but... Well, it's not much. 
 And it's only temporary, Until you guys rock the concert in four days. 
 And big time rush gets some big time investors. 
 Then we go on tour, get your album released. 
 Then I get my studio and my mansion back. 
 This'll be fine. 
 We can do this. 
 And see how positive I'm remaining? 
 But before we do anything, we need to find James. 
 And get rehearsals started up again. 
 Got it; we'll go straight to the palmwoods So I can see jo. 
 What he really means is, Maybe somebody at the palmwoods has seen camille... I mean James. 
 This looks like a job for... My still-unnamed superhero. 
 Whoo! 
 This place is so depressing since the guys left. 
 And the music doesn't help. 
 Oh, uh, sorry. 
 What's everyone so down about? 
 Kendall! 
 Logan! 
 Logan! 
 Lightning! Oh! 
 Okay, guys, um, after the concert, I need to get a girlfriend. 
 What, the concert's back on? 
 As soon as we find James. 
 Yeah, has anybody seen him? 
 Uh, yeah, he's living here, In your old apartment. 
 May I help you? 
 Yeah, we're looking for James. 
 Do come in. 
 We shall come in. 
 This is our old apartment? 
 Irasshaimase! 
 Those are Sushi chefs. 
 Oh! And what happened to swirly? 
 Hey, what are you guys doing here? 
 I mean... What are  you  guys doing here? 
 Big time rush is back together. 
 Yes, so... Let's get dressed and go. 
 Ã- yeah, and what happened to swirly? 
 We got to get back to rocque records. 
 To get ready for the concert. 
 Yeah! 
 No. 
 You see, Hawk signed me To a three-record deal, Modified the crib to suit my new personal style, And gave me...Sebastian! 
 Hot towel, gentlemen? 
 Ooh, why, thank you. 
 Ooh, and, as I recall, You were the ones who told me to get real and move on, So I did. 
 Megaphone for emphasis, sir? 
 Ooh, yeah. 
 I rock! 
 James, I was mad, okay? 
 We shouldn't have broken up the band. 
 But we've always promised since we were peewee hockey players. 
 That we would stick together. 
 Ooh, and you've never broken a promise? 
 I can't believe Those boys did it to me again. 
 We might be horrible people. 
 But we'll fix it. 
 But first, we need to fix the band. 
 James, we're sorry. 
 Now, let's go. Come on. 
 He's not going anywhere, Because he's got everything he needs here. 
 Right, James? 
 Some toys or money, sir? 
 Ooh. 
 Excellent choice. 
 You guys told me to move on, so...I did. 
 And now my assistant, Rebecca, will show you the door. 
 She's gonna show us the door? 
 I'm leaving! I'm leaving! 
 What do you mean James isn't coming back? 
 He got a three-record deal. 
 And his own Sebastian. 
 I could get you a three-record deal And a Sebastian. 
 What's a Sebastian? 
 Gustavo, we're eating pb&j on box furniture. 
 You just have to nail this concert! 
 What concert? 
 There's no big time rush without James. 
 Then we'll find a new James. 
 If he thinks he can do without us, Then we can do without him. 
 He's right; bands replace members all the time. 
 The rolling stones had three guitarists. 
 Destiny's child replaced every member Except for beyonce. 
 And there have been three Britney Spears. 
 Let's get a new James. 
 And now, the newest addition. 
 To Hawk records' line of pop superstars... 
 You spelled my name wrong. 
 No, I didn't. 
 You're jamez with a "z" now. 
 It's "awezome." 
 Isn't that technically ja-mez? 
 I don't pay you to speak, Sebastian. 
 What's wrong with my lips? 
 We added new ones. 
 We wanted something fuller. 
 Yours are too thin. 
 And check out your new... 
"zingle." 
 ♪ girl, girl, girl, girl ♪ 
♪ you so fine ♪. 
 But I haven't recorded anything yet. 
 You don't have to, Thanks to digital enhancement. 
 Like we did with your lips. 
 And together, We are going to crush Gustavo and big time rush. 
 But I don't want to crush big time rush. 
 Those guys are my friends... Or they were. 
 Ja-mez, do you want to have friends. 
 Or do you want to be famous? 
 And besides, if they were really your friends, Would they be searching all over town For your replacement? 
 I want to be famous. 
 Okay, guys, time to find new James. 
 Let's do it!

 And you're not gonna miss the cool pad, the hot towels, And Sebastian? 
 Yes, no, and yes. 
 Well, don't sweat it, Because once we nail the concert, We're gonna go back to the palmwoods. 
 And get our own Sebastian, right? 
 And what about Hawk? 
 We'll talk about your Sebastian later. 
 And we've got bigger problems than Hawk, As in the concert is in two days. 
 And we haven't sold a single ticket. 
 And all the posters are now wrong! 
 Don't worry. 
 Katie will donate her posters. 
 No, I won't. 
 Katie, donate them! 
 Okay. 
 But I get concession space for my hats and t-shirts. 
 Deal. 
 Kelly, what money do we have. 
 Left in the budget for street team advertising. 
 And local tv spots? 
 We got 5 bucks and a punch card. 
 For one free schmetzel's pretzel. 
 We'll go back to the palmwoods. 
 And get some street team volunteers. 
 And I think I may know a way we can get some free tv spots. 
 Well, what are you waiting for? 
 I can't sell this band to investors. 
 If we don't sell out the concert. 
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Get out of here!

 But when big time rush Misses their first concert, Your music careers will be dead. 
 And more importantly, So will Gustavo's chances. 
 Of ever topping me on the charts again. 
 We'll tell Gustavo where to find you and your phones. 
 Once the crowd boos and abandons the concert. 
 When you mess with the Hawk, You get all ten talons. 
 Hawks actually only have eight talons. 
 I don't care! 
 Okay, just telling you. 
 But I do want to catch your concert. 
 So I don't miss the look on Gustavo's face. 
 When he loses everything. 
 Caw! Caw! 
 Oh, God, I can't find them anywhere! 
 Oh, what are the words I'm looking for? 
 Oh, yeah... Where are they? 
 Gustavo... How's it going? 
 Hey. Eeeeh. 
 Don't worry. 
 The concert doesn't start for 20 minutes. 
 They have never let you down. 
 They will be here. 
 Just stay calm! 
 Okay. 
 Help! 
 Don't worry, best friends of mine, For this looks like a job for... Carlos, not now. 
 Yes, now!

 Oh. Oh, no, no. 
 No! 
 Kelly, come back! 
 Kelly, come back! 
 Come back, Kelly! 
 Gustavo, did you not want the curtain open? 
 Hawk, I should have known it was you. 
 You remember my assistant, Rebecca.

 Aww, the crowd stopped cheering. 
 This is the part where I laugh evilly. 
 Caw! 
 Oh, how I hate L.A. Traffic... And superficiality and...

 Just, please! 
 I'm going to lose My California limousine license for this.
