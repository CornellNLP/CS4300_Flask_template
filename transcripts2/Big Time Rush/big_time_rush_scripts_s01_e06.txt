 What time is it? 
 All: It's girl time. 
 [pounding dance music] 
 Talk to us when you get in the top ten. 
 But not before. 
 How could you? 
 With my mom in the hospital, and my huge fight with my best friend, and my zit? 
 [together] Degrassi audition? 
 Wish me luck. 
 Ow. 
 Simms twins. 
 [gasps] 
 Too risky. 
 They get pretty upset if you get their names wrong. 
 Hello, ladies. 
 What's my name? 
 Uh... 
 Mandy? 
 [growls] 
 [screams] 
 [together] Sandy. 
 Why can't there be a nice, sweet, nice girl at the Palmwoods? 
 Somebody not crazy or stuck-up. 
 That's still really hot. 
 From north Carolina. 
 Well, it's not north Carolina, but I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay here. 
 Let me show you your apartment. 
 [soul music]

 Today we are gonna sing a love song. 
 It's a slow song, about love. 
 The record company wants one of your demo songs to be a ballad. 
 Okay, does anybody else notice the huge guy in the corner? 
 I do. That is freight train, my new executive in charge of making people do what I say. 
 Now, this is a song about when you see a girl for the first time, and you know she's the one. 
 Do you guys know what I'm talking about? 
 [soul music] 
 She's mine. 
 Dude, she's mine! 
 [all yelling at once] 
 Freight train! 
 Whoa! 
 [gasps] 
 That was kind of fun. 
 What is that smell? 
 It's barracuda man spray. 
 We're in love with a girl at the Palmwoods, and this is my edge. 
 [puma roars] 
 Better wear your 'cuda. 
 You need an edge? 
 You always get the girl. 
 Yeah, give us a chance for once. 
 She will be mine. 
 No, she's gonna be mine. 
 No, she's not. [all yelling] 
 Dogs. Booth. Now. 
 [all yelling] 
 He is really good.

 ♪ that's the kind I'll be ♪ 
 [sneezes]

 [sneezes] 
 ♪ Yes, I will ♪ 
 This is a song about love, not sneezing! 
 [microphone feedback shrieks] 
 But the pollen count is really high today. 
 Then get him to a doctor and fix him, while I fix the song, because it's horrible. 
 Freight train, take the dogs home. 
 No, I don't want to go to the doctor. I'm in love. [sneezes] 
 Oh, hi, freight train. 
 Sorry, James, but we have to go back to the Palmwoods now. 
 You are not allowed to talk to her until I'm back. 
 I mean it! [sneezes] 
 Logan, what's the intel? 
 Well, according to your mom's Cosmopolitan magazine,  75% of the female population is attracted to the bad boy type. 
 I call the bad boy type. 
 But it won't matter, because 
100% of the female population is attracted to men with British accents. 
 But none of us are British. 
 Speak for yourself, governor. 
 What are you gonna go with, Kendall? 
 60% like the steamy firemen, 40% like the brooding loner, and 0.7% like the jolly pastry chef. 
 How long will you be staying at the Palmwoods? 
 [laughs] 
 I'm gonna be myself. 
 [laughter] 
 [together] That never works. 
 [sneezes] 
 Now, this should make it all better. 
 Ah. 
 Okay, what seems to be the problem? 
 The problem is that I'm here when I need to be at the Palmwoods, impressing the girl of my dreams. 
 It sounds serious. 
 I'm prescribing one does of black bolero jacket and 100 CCs of tight pants. 
 Awesome. 
[sneezes] 
 He needs to stop sneezing so that he can sing. 
 It sounds like Roseanne Barr syndrome: the irreversible deterioration of the glands resulting in pain so severe, it can only be relieved by the sweet mercy of death. 
 [sneezes] 
 Are you sure it's not pollen? 
 Pollen. Of course. 
 James, are you afraid of receiving giant shots? 
 [shrieks] 
 ♪ Here I am, there you are ♪ 
♪ why does it seem so far? ♪ 
♪ Next to you is where I should be ♪ 
 Sounds nice. 
 [dissonant tone] 
 Why are you here? 
 Katie has a report for school. 
 I'm supposed to do it on somebody I admire, and I picked you. 
 Oh, that is so sweet. 
 I'm busy! 
 Hey, she admires you! 
 And would it kill you to be nice for once? 
 She can stay and ask four questions. 
 Go easy on him. 
 Do you really admire me? 
 No, but if I picked Eleanor Roosevelt, I'd have to read a bunch of stuff. 
 Smart. 
 First question. 
 Your song is lame. 
 That is not a question! 
 [dramatic spy music] 
 [in English accent] Okay. 
 We'll draw palm leaves to see who gets to ask her out first. 
 Short one wins. 
 My turn. 
 The other one. 
 Logan, give it. 
 Uh-uh. 
 I've never had a girlfriend. 
 Ah! 
 Oh, yes. 
 Stand back, boys, And watch the bad boy get the pretty girl. 
 Hi, I'm Jo. 
 Cool jacket. 
 Oh, are you going out for the bad boy role 
 in "magic middle school"? 
 I mean, it's a really strong role, but I hate bad boys in real life. 
 I mean, why so angry all the time? 
 Yeah. 
 Poor old chap. He's in a bit of a sticky wicket. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't get your name. 
 [mumbling] 
 [in English accent] Reginald Salisbury from England. 
 Wha... 
 How exciting. 
 Oh, my family visits there every year. What part of England are you from? 
 Uh, cheerio. Put another shrimp on the Barbie. 
 Danke schon. 
 You stole my bit. 
 She smells so nice, and I panicked. 
 She will be mine! 
 Oh! 
 Camille, not now. 
 Please, not now. 
 Of course I'll take you back. 
 I'm gonna tell Rachel we're back together, and that I will destroy anybody, who tries so come between us. 
 [whimpers] 
 One Tree Hill? 
 Yeah, let's go with that. 
 That was... 
 [laughs] 
[scoffs] 
 Whaa. 
 I get a do-over. 
 No, you don't. 
 Was Camille a good kisser? 
 I was... 
 Pleasantly surprised. 
 Okay, boys. 
 Now it's my turn. 
 [rock music] 
 Aah! Hockey pucks! 
 [laughter]

 Don't you have to be in love to write a love song? 
 I mean, you're not wearing a wedding ring, and don't you hate every living thing? 
 You don't need love to write a love song. 
 You need passion. 
 You replace what your passionate about, for love. 
 Okay, so that song is about a sandwich? 
 I don't know what this song is about! 
 Songs usually come to me! 
 But this one is not. 
 "Gustavo doesn't know how to write a song, and has never loved." 
 Finished. 
 Sit down! 
 This song's gonna be great. 
 I'll show you. 
 Freight train! 
 Dogs. Now. 
 You got it. 
 Can I borrow him sometime? 
 No, you cannot. 
 Look, I'm not sneezing anymore, so I... I guess I can go back to the Palmwoods now, and I definitely need that shot. 
[sneezes] 
 James, it's not gonna hurt a bit. 
 It's gonna hurt a lot. 
 [shrieks] 
 Stay back. I'm not afraid to use this. 
 Barracuda man spray. 
 Now in new spice lime. 
 Better wear your 'cuda. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Is there anything besides that shot that get him to stop sneezing today? 
 Hmm, there is one thing that might work. 
 Do you think I need a chin implant? 
 So we were thinking, you definitely need a girl strategy. 
 So try this. 
 [gulps] 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick with the "be myself" strategy. 
 I told you we should have used the glue. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I just wanted to welcome you to the Palmwoods. 
 I'm Kendall, and, uh... 
 This looks weird, right? 
 Uh, we can continue this conversation when my friend freight train puts me down. 
 Oh. 
 We'll do this again sometime. 
 Yes! 
 Yes! 
 Whoo! 
 Whoo! 
 That is not fair. I get a do-over. 
 No, you don't. 
 This is fun.

 [garbled singing] 
 What was that? 
 What was that? 
 You told me to get him to stop sneezing, and I did. 
 But he can't sing! 
 And we have to sing this love song, because the record company wants a love song, and I still hate this song! 
 Well, he refuses to take an allergy shot, and I'm not an nurse! 
 Your yelling has improved. 
 But more like this: Get him an allergy shot! 
 It's my fault, Gustavo. 
 [sneezes] 
 I need to do this. 
 I'll go get the shot. 
 [puma roars] 
 What the... 
 I'm not feeling too well. 
 I need a shot right now. 
 You know what, I'm gonna stay here. 
 I'm gonna stay. 
 Yeah, that's fine. 
 It's not that bad of a song. 
 In fact, if I was a girl and someone sang it to me, I'd be really touched. 
 How touched? 
 Like go out with you touched? 
 If we sang this song to you... if you were a girl? 
 Yeah. 
 [all yelling] 
 "so after a day trapped "within the soundproof walls of his studio, Gustavo couldn't write the song that he wanted and failed." 
 Report done. 
 Your report and my song are not done! 
 Release the hounds! 
 I need more time. 
 Where's James? 
 Well, we were in my car, then he jumped out, sprayed his entire body with man spray, jumped into a cab and shouted, "she will be mine! 
 She will be mine!" 
 He's going to the Palmwoods to steal our girl! 
 [screams] 
 [boogie music] 
 Hello. 
 [both shriek] 
 Not the reaction I usually get. 
 But I'm James. 
 I'm in a band. 
 Hi, I'm Jo. 
 It's so nice to meet you. 
 Hey, I was thinking maybe we could see a movie later on. 
 [sneezes] 
 Don't you think you should see a doctor first? 
 Oh, because of my sneezing, right? 
 Aah! 
 What happened to my hands? 
 [sniffs] 
 Are you wearing barracuda man spray? 
 Yeah. 
 Better wear your 'cuda. 
 You do know that stuff was recalled for causing severe allergic reactions, right? 
 Aah! 
 [shrieking] 
 Kelly, pick me up. I need that shot now. 
 [all shrieking] 
 I'm allergic to man spray, And you are not allowed to talk to her until I'm pretty again. 
 [together] Forget it. 
 I'm gonna sing her a song. 
 No, I am. 
 No, I am. 
 No. 
 [all yelling] 
 I was gonna sing a song and not you. 
 No. 
 No! 
 [Ding! Ding!] 
 She left the pool. 
 All: She's gone? 
 Yes, she went to an audition. She usually returns at 5:30. 
 [all yelling] 
 Hey, tell me how you ended your report. 
 I can take it. I'm a man. 
 [huffs] 
 "Clearly past his prime, and with no life experience to reflect on, Gustavo couldn't finish the love song. He so desperately craved." 
 That is so not cool. 
 My report is due tomorrow. 
 And so is my song, which I can't find! 
 You can help me. 
 Have you ever loved something so much that you couldn't live without it? 
 My premium cable package. 
 I see your point. 
 [exclaims] 
 Try getting out of that box once in a while and live life. 
 That song is not in there, dude. 
 Trust me. 
 Would you like to join us for a sandwich? 
 Can I come too? 
 Sure. 
 Shotgun. 
 Give me a shot now! 
 I'm not afraid anymore, And I am not pretty under here, and... and I'm in love and... 
 Pffft. 
 [shrieks] 
 Hey. 
 That wasn't that bad. 
 Nice jacket. 
 What did you give him? 
 Something for his panic attack. 
 Were you not here? 
 He's got to sing a song! 
 Hmm. 
 Sing a song, sing a song, sing-a-song shot. 
 ♪ Sing-a-song shot...♪ 
 [laughing] Oh, yeah. 
 Okay, go now. 
 Here is perfect. 
 Well, shouldn't we wait for the other dudes? 
 Change of plans. It's a solo now.
