 Merry Christmas. 
 Don't open it till tomorrow. 
 Thank you. 
 And here's my present to you. 
 A canned ham. 
 Yes. 
 Or would you prefer... 
 Oh, a... 
 CD in the bag... 
 A scented candle. 
 I'll keep the ham. 
 And I will see you guys next year. 
 Palmwoods *** 
 Ho, ho, ho. 
 (Cheers ). 
 Stop... right there until you get your Christmas gift. 
 Baby's first birthday frame. 
 No. 
 It's our first Christmas frame, or it will be when you put a picture of us in it. 
 And here is my gift to you. 
 Wow! Jett, an eye slab? 
 And it's preloaded with pics... 
 Of us. 
 Oh, that's right, you don't have a TV show with a three-year contract like me. 
 Yes, but you don't have tree friends that are hockey players... 
 Like me. 
 Oh no, no, no... be careful. Joe, *** them off. 
 Guys! *** 
 And this is... my gift to you. 
 I wonder what it could be. 
 Just kiss me under the missiletoe. 
 Hey girls. 
 Missiletoe. 
 Now you have to kiss me. 
 No, we have to catch a flight. 
 Oh, what the heck, it's Christmas. 
 Oh, I love you. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 So, who is your lucky lady going to be? 
 (Screaming ) 
 Oh, don't look these are presents but they're not wrapped. 
 Well, all of these are. And I need help packing. 
 I have to get all of these presents in the carry-on bag so we're not charged a fortune. 
 Who cares? Tomorrow is Christmas with toys and snow and... toys. 
 Christmas is not go toys, it's about giving and being with the people you love. 
 No, it's about toys. 
 It is so... 
 Bad. 
 Okay. 
 Our flight leaves in five hours so who is helping? 
 Oh, all of us but first we have to give Gustavo his amazing present. 
 Oh, don't forget about Kelly. 
 Right. 
 Does anyone know if she likes regular track shoes. 
 Dogs, let's make this quick because... 
 ♪ I'm going to Fiji for the holidays. ♪ 
 Okay. That's not my best song ever but who cares? I'm going to Fiji. 
 Well, we just wanted to give you... this. 
 We ordered it special. 
 Oh. 
 Pajamas? 
 Really. 
 Every Christmas we wear our PJs all day long. 
 It's our holiday tradition. 
 Ya, I'm not doing that. 
 And this is for you. 
 Oh it's a... panini alarm clock. 
 Just what I wanted. 
 Or... 
 We could offer you this pig watering can... 
 ... Or this rock star nutcracker. 
 I stay with this. 
 All: Yes. 
 So, what did you get us? 
 That is a surprise. 
 All: Oh. 
 Kelly, get them something surprising for Christmas and ship it. 
 Now let's start the holidays! 
 All: Whoo! 
 Great news, everyone. 
 I decided to release a Big Time Rush Christmas ep. 
 Since it will bring your fans lots of holiday joy and me, lots of holiday money. 
 So, you're putting extended mixes in Christmas packaging. 
 No I'm putting Christmas songs in Christmas packaging. 
 We haven't recorded any Christmas songs. 
 Well, then you better get started because no one is going anywhere, until I get my holiday song. 
 Three Christmas songs and make our flight by tonight. 
 It can't be done! 
 Sure it can. 
 It's called a Christmas miracle. 
 Like me getting kiss by the Jennifer today? 
 I heard *** lost her artificial leg, right!? 
 And found it next morning in her stocking Christmas. 
 See? I want songs are available for download tonight. 
 Now, since it's Christmas Eve I'm off to the office to fire some people. 
 I will check in with you later. 
 We should do this. 
 I think it would be nice to give our fans a Christmas gift. 
 I can't write three songs in three hours. 
 Actually you wrote Yard Squirrels Christmas in five minutes and it's your biggest selling single, ever. 
 Yard Squirrels! 
 This was a stupid, novelty song with sped up voices and I hate it did. 
 Hey, I love that song. 
 All: Everybody loves that song. 
 I write the best pop songs in the world. 
 And I don't want to be remembered for that stupid squirrel song. 
 Well then it's time to write a new Christmas classic. 
 You can do it, Gustavo. 
 You're a *** 
 You have the power to get us home for Christmas. 
 And get yourself to Fiji. 
 Get me blank music sheets, 13 candy canes, and a cup of coco with marshmallows piled high. 
 Because we're about to pull off a big time Christmas miracle. 
 ♪ oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree. ♪ 
♪ won't you help me close this stupid... ♪ 
 Katie, the presents. 
 I can't help it. 
 It's almost Christmas. 
 And I'm out of holiday cheer. 
 There is plenty of cheeriness around here. 
 Look at our tree. 
 Well, you can help me pack these presents or you can check the lobby for your Christmas cheer. 
 Dude, this is the saddest lobby, ever. 
 Where is the big tree? Where is the tinsel? 
 Where are the blinking lights? 
 Where are the people? Gone for the holidays. 
 So, I don't need to decorate. 
 And I can't wait for you and the hockey hits to leave because I love my Palmwoods empty. 
 Seriously you're not going to hang one ornament? 
 You want some holiday cheer? 
 Found this in the laundry room. 
 Have a palm woods Christmas. 
 I'm eating this. 
 (Humming ) 
 No. 
 (Humming ) 
 ... And wonderful... 
 I wish you have a merry wonderful... 
 Anything? 
 Great Christmas songs don't just happen. 
 I need to be in a Christmassy mood. 
 Can we help you? 
 How? 
 Well, whenever we want to get into a Christmassy mood All: We get into our... 
 PJs! 
 How do they do that? 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Yeah, I'm not wearing PJs. 
 Well, we could try decorating the place. 
 Oh, I have always wanted to decorate the studio for Christmas. 
 ♪ 
 Oh, yeah, yeah that's a great idea. 
 Let's take a couple of hours driving around town and buying Christmas decorations. 
 Eh, what are you talking about? 
 Every company in this building is gone for the holidays. 
 Yeah, I'm sure they wouldn't mind if we "borrowed decorations".

 See, Christmas miracles do happen. 
 And thanks for the PJs boy they make me feel so Christmassy. 
 Christmassy enough to let us release a single instead of an ep? 
 Oh, oh, oh... no. 
 Make the other two celebrity duets. 
 All: Celebrity duets? 
 How are we suppose to get celebrities to sing with Big Time Rush on Christmas Eve? 
 It's easy... you just get celebrities and sing with them. 
 Now if you will excuse me, I'm off to a soup kitchen to remind myself how lucky I am on Christmas. 
 Bye bye. 
 You mean bye bye Christmas in Minnesota. 
 As Kendall fell back, the boys stood listless or *** crushed for Minnesota Christmas. 
 So with just hours to catch their holiday jets the gang prayed for another miracle and to celebrity duet. Okay, I've just pushed back all of our planes four hours. And how can we do on the celebrity search? I've just *** at the phone with Lady Gaga's people. Oh, what did they say? Who is Big Time Rush? What about ***? He's out town for the holidays. Just like every other celebrity we can sing with. Hey, but on the bright side astronaut Buzz Aldrin is very interested. He's the man who walked on the moon. There has to be some celebrities who's still in town. Join me Miranda Cosgrove... *** Christmas special. Live from Los Angeles. With duets of your favourite stars, like international super star Fabio, like Snoop Dogg, and... Big Time Rush. How? It will be another Christmas miracle. Did you find your holiday cheer? I found bitters, he's a holiday killjoy. Well, honey, not everybody loves the holidays. How could anyone not love the time of toy, family and presents? Well, not everyone has a joyful family spending time with and presents, and some people actually find Christmas to be very... Stressful. But not me because all the presents are packed and ready to go. Okay, but what about the clothes? I don't know! Katie? How could anybody not like Christmas? What's the plan? The plan is there is no plan if we can't get into the studio. Easy, all we have to do is get past security. Piece of cake. No entry if you're not on the list. Don't panic! Remember there is one guy who is on everybody's list. Ho, ho, ho merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho... Seriously you thought I would believe you were Santa, and his elves? But I am Santa. No, no, no. You're on my naughty list, pal. Sir, special delivery for Miranda Cosgrove. All packages must be inspected. Yo, you can't open Miranda's present, dude. (Yelling). I told you this was a bad idea. Hello. We are the *** Christmas clog dancers. We are here to dance for the TV program. Well let's see you dance. The other way. ♪♪♪ I have had enough of you! I think he's choking. Oh, oh, oh. Do something. It's another Christmas miracle. Okay. We might be horrible people... You're good, you're good. Yes. That was gross. Thanks. Who are you guys? We're Big Time Rush and we just want to get home for the holidays. Please, please. We have to go, we have to. Well, merry Christmas. I dropped my clipboard and I'm distracted and can't see you. Goodbye. Have a palm woods holiday. Hey, so we're leaving tonight and can't take this with us so I thought maybe you would like it. Oh, how thoughtful. A holiday hammy down to get pine needles all over my lobby. No, thank you. Look I just thought would you use some holiday cheers, you know brighten up your day. If you want to brighten up my day, get on your plane and leave instead of giving me a Christmas weed. Merry Christmas, I guess. (Humming ) Katie, guess how we're going to get all of our press scents and our clothes on the plane without being charged a thing. We're going to wear all of our clothes. We're going to wear all of our clothes. Mom, we're lucky to have each other during the holidays. Aren't we? Of course. Being with family for the holidays is what it's all about, honey. Honey, help mommy. Going down! Home made mittens? Baby bear, this present is just right. Now that's what I call a Beary Christmas. Coming up next Miranda's duet with superstar Fabio when *** Miranda's Christmas special returns. Next commercial. Bears are funny. Okay, you have five minutes to change and get ready for a duet with Fabio. All we have to do is get dream boat Fabio not to make his performance. The producer will freak. How will they replace Fabio 
*** noticed? That's when we show up. 
*** Hey do you need someone to sing a duet with Miranda? We're Big Time Rush. We're a band. We record the song and boom. Christmas miracle number two. And me and Kelly hack into the soundboard, and record the whole thing. Good luck. Okay. Now how do we keep Fabio from stepping on that stage? Oh, hello, Christmas bears. By the way hilarious sketch. Can I help you with something? You are freaking me out now. *** live. Let me out. *** This is all beary nice. Miranda, Miranda. Please tell me this isn't dressing room whose I think it is. And who might not like we kidnapped her guest star. What's going on here? Oh, Miranda, help! Oh, no. Not Big Time Rush again. Miranda, do you believe in Christmas miracles? As Miranda stared daggers the boys began to fret. Would this be their worst big time Christmas yet? Back to our big time Christmas. Now full of scares for Miranda had just caught Logan and his three bears. You're all going to jail for Christmas. Oh no, don't call the police. We're allergic to police. We weren't Fabio napping. We were hiding him to record a song with Miranda. *** Fabio? Look, if we don't record thee songs by today our C.E.O. won't let us go home for Christmas. We're Big Time Rush, we're a band. They're really cute. They locked Fabio in a *** Yeah, but they're really cute. My daughter loves their album. ♪♪♪ a movie to watch for me. And by the way I'm a horrible singer. He's right he's a horrible singer. And we can sing... Sing... Sing... Sing. 
 
 So, how are we doing? Honestly... it could go either way. Okay. The producer should be freaking out looking for a replacement for Fabio by now. Which means is a miracle happened and the guys are in wardrobe or they got caught and we're going to jail for Christmas. Welcome back to have yourself a Miranda little Christmas. (Doorbell). Hey, I hope it's the Christmas pizza I've ordered. Hey Miranda. It's Fabio's pizza delivery. I got you candy cane peppermint pizza. Yum. What took you so long? I got stuck in the snow. How did you get out? Well, you know, some guys came along and helped me. Hey, what's up Miranda? Hey, merry Christmas. Big Time Rush. ♪♪♪ Fiji, here I come. Do you guys want to join me for a song?

You wouldn't happen to have any... Marshmallows. Mmm. Now that's good coco. I can't believe we're going to record a song with Snoop Dogg. Hey, it's the least I could do after running Gustavo rock over with a limo. Now I just have to write this song. Don't worry, you won't be here long he writes songs really fast. I got it. I got it. I don't got it. I'm never going to Fiji. You know what, Snoop? This is all part of the process. He gets it, doesn't get it, then he cries. Hey, who is the present for? Grandma. Cool, is it a diamond encrusted dentures? Is it a *** bracelet? It's number one *** Is it a helicopter? Boys, it's even better. It's a home made scented candle holder, and I made it myself.

But Santa will miss us this year because we're not in Minnesota. Ho, ho, ho. Close enough. I missed my flight to Fiji. So I figured I would spend the holidays with my dogs... ... In my PJs. Yes! And we brought a little holiday feast. Oh! So, with family beside you and friends together, that's the recipe for the best holiday ever. And give your gifts many, keep your hearts full of light, and merry Christmas to all... And to all... a big time night.
