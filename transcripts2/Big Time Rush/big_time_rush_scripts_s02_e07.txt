 The time of pranks is upon us. 
 And as last year's Victor, I must now let all you competitors challenge me, for the crown. 
 It seems like it was just yesterday that we made that crown in our class. 
 The rules are simple. 
 If ye is pranked ye is out. 
 The last man who is unprinked becomes the Lord High King, and wins the crown. 
 And this is I am playing. 
 Playing? 
 Katie, this isn't a game. 
 You're too young and too girl. 
 And no girls shall play so said Lord Prankerton's book of Ruin. 
 You guys made this *** in middle school. 
 And that is a picture of Sir Walter Raleigh. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Katie, this competition is very ugly and if you get hurt mom will kill me. 
 This is not over. 
 Very well. 
 Each competitor gets two hours to prepare. 
 For the pranking commencing at... noon. 
 You know what? You guys go ahead. 
 I got to call my grandma. 
 And by my grandma I mean I will be lord of the pranks. 
 The guys are late, and they're not picking up their cell phones. 
 That's because I gave them the day off for pranking. 
 What? We've got a ton of work to do. 
 Kelly, pranks are a rite of pass, for the young male. 
 Really? 
 I can't wait to hear the rest of the story. 
 Fine. Now, please be useful, and get me sugar to put in my coffee. 
 Thank you. 
 Sugar packet pile on. And Gustavo *** classic. 
 You got pranked. 
 When the guys return at noon they'll seek refreshment. 
 They'll see my free smoothies. 
 What they don't know is that in each smoothie is a balloon with 120 pounds of pure nitrous oxide pressure. 
 Then they'll pick up the niddle ***, push the straw down into the smoothie, and then boom the crown will be mine. 
 Is that about that the stupid crown you guys made in middle school. 
 I can't see. 
 I can't see. 
 Come on, I'll take you to the doctor. 
 Bear suit, interesting. 
 The crown will be mine. 
 What's this about girls not being good at pranks? 
 Never said that, I just said it could be ugly and girls could get hurt. 
 So you think girls are not *** guys. 
 Have you seen the bear standing next to me? 
 This competition gets scary. 
 Sounds to me like you guys are scared to get your butts beat by a bunch of girls. 
 Wait, what? 
 10 against 4? 
 And that's fair? 
 We're in. 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 
 We are still one short. 
 I'm in, too. 
 What? 
 I don't like you, but I have to defend my gender. 
 So be it. 
 As reigning so High King Lord of the pranks, I know declare this is Mega Pranking Edition. 
 Bug out. 
 Laces *** together. 
 Classic. 
 So that's three boys down... 
 ... and three to go. 
 Change of plans. 
 We layoff each other until we prank all the girls. 
 Yes, an alliance. 
 So, as agreed, we eliminate the girls, then the other guys until it's just the four of us. 
 Make that three. 
 Looks like Logan pranked himself again this year. 
 Yep. 
 There, all better. 
 Everything looks pink. 
 I'm a doctor, I can fix this. 
 Now everything is blue. 
 What color do you want? 
 I don't know... all of them. 
 There we go. That's better. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 Aren't you going to prescribe me some saline drops to soothe my itchy and irritated eyes. 
 Logan have you thought of becoming a doctor? 
 Because you look and talk like a doctor. 
 Oh, he's always wanted to be a doctor. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Did you know that the daily 20-minute walk increases weight lost? 
 ♪♪♪ 
 We have first-degree rug burns. 
 I've got just the thing. 
 No. 
 Just untie them and give them some topical cream for the abrasions. 
 Yeah that will work too. 
 Kelly, Griffin is coming to get these contracts. 
 Where is my pen? 
 It should be right here in your drawer. 
 Well played. 
 Let's end it now while it's even. 
 Agreed. 
 Here at the *** global net *** 
we have a strict no pranking policy. 
 Can't understand you Gustavo because your mouth is taped shut. 
 Which is why I'm going to stay here, and help you stopping your pranking ways. 
 Lip balm. 
 Free lip labels samples? 
 Free samples. 
 I love lip balm. 
 Oh, did someone put fake labels on glue sticks? 
 Yeah, non-toxic, of course. 
 [Bracket laughing] 
 We warned you this would get ugly. 
 [laughing] 
 why is the third floor covered in toilet paper? 
 And my butt covered in eggs? 
 We have no idea, Mr. Bit Sir. 
 Bye. 
 I know you're up to something. 
 And you got pranked. 
 And you got pranked. 
 You got p-r-a-n-k-e-d. 
 I think I can solve this problem. 
 Perfectly tuned. 
 Don't you think we should unwind the strings and remove the guitar from his head? 
 Logan you've got the gift. 
 How would you like to stay and be my assistant. 
 But I don't have a medical license. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 You are now a deputy doctor. 
 Code blue 621. 
 Hey, Mrs. Knight. Do you mind ***? 
 Are you kidding? I'm in magazine heaven. 
 I just learned how to give my feet a facial. 
 Because you have no respect for each other's jobs, I'm recommending the role reversal method. 
 The classic *** 
 that teaches mutual respect. 
 So what I have to do all day is write songs to the girl in it, and scream a lot. 
 Oh, yeah *** even known what she does. 
 I know this. 
 Mandatory... the role reversal is now mandatory. 
 Fine. 
 I'll Gustavo. 
 
 
 
 ♪♪♪ 
 and bla bla bla... 
 Kelly, call all the dogs, I have work to do. 
 [screaming] 
 Isn't this better? 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Thee guys get off the elevator to rush to the appointment for shelter. 
 And they'll trip on the wire, and get a face full of creamy defeat. 
 Boys are stupid. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 That is stupid. 
 Brilliant. 
 I know. 
 Okay, but now, we turn the table on them, and then the prankers become the prankees. 
 Now all we have to do is hide and watch the show. 
 Got you. 
 Hey. We told you that pranking was dangerous. 
 Well, does your lord Prankerton allowed to make sure someone is okay? 
 No, he doesn't. It's called the Logan Amendment. 
 Let's go. 
 Camille you okay? 
 She stopped crying. 
 It was my idea to sacrifice one of us so we could take out all of you. 
 Yep, we're doomed. 
 They look so cute but they hopeless lost. 
 Ready? 
 Dogs! 
 I am Kelly today. 
 Long story. 
 So studio, now. 
 Let's use him as a shield. 
 Ah. 
 Hey, thanks for the day of the Pranking Gustavo. 
 I'm Kelly. 
 So close. 
 Well, maybe it's not a total loss. 
 Everything sounds like pie. 
 I can fix this but you may feel a small pinch. 
 No...

 Good luck. 
 Knights of prankdom. 
 Move out. 
 Or we let Kendall prank all the girls by himself. 
 While we stay low, stay unpranked. 
 Yeah, that's just what I was thinking. 
 But you forgot one thing. 
 I take you out and battle Kendall later because you just fell into my *** trap. 
 You mean you've just fell right into my... rope snare. 
 Touché old friend. 
 Right back at you buddy. 
 What's going on here? I want answers now. 
 I'm not telling you. 
 I'm bound by lord prankerton's code of silence. 
 I'll give you priority ***

 It was all Kendall's fault. 
 He's the lord and he forced us into a prank war, and they'll keep pranking until there's only one left. 
 He pranked me.

 Nobody messes up with my Palmwoods, and nobody messes with me.

 What can I say? 
 It's rotten milk.

 I told you this battle would get nasty. 
 No! 
 The only way by ending the Prank war is pranking all of you out then so be it. 
 What's the matter Kendall? 
 Looks like you're in... a jam. 
 Darn it. 
 Joe. 
 Is it bad? 
 It's going to leave a nasty stain. 
 I better pretreat this or I'll never get it out.

 Logan, I'm calling up my al-mother. 
 *** medical program, and I'm recommending you for immediate admission.

 I'm just going to reach for a tissue so I can blow my nose. 
 Both: The crown will be mine! 
 Sorry, boys, but that crown will be mine. 
 Hey can I borrow the seltzer? 
 Take it. 
 Good luck. 
 Thanks. 
 [inaudible mumbling] 
 Why are you laughing? 
 Because there's no such thing as the role reversal method. 
 I made it up. 
 You got pranked. 
 You mean, none of this was real. 
 Oh, yeah, it was real... real funny. 
 But I'm sure it *** 
 Now, on to more important matters. 
 Where do you keep the sugar? 
 In the cabinet. 
 Well, looks like all our patients have been treated. 
 And I made homemade ice pops. 
 I got the money saving recipe from a magazine. 
 Remember what I said, Logan we need you on the far side. 
 What's that face for? 
 I had a great time today helping people, but I also had great time singing, so what do I do, stay with the band or... become a doctor? 
 You know what sweetheart? 
 That's what's great about being a teenager you don't have to decide right now. 
 Thanks, Mrs. Knight. 
 You always know what to say. 
 I do now. 
 Who're you? 
 Who do you think? 
 Still think I can't handle a day of pranks, big brother? 
 Lord Prankerton would be very proud of you baby sister. 
 But this battle is not over. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Because if either of you make another mess I will pull off the ultimate prank. 
 I will close the pool for two weeks. 
 The war is over. 
 Put down your weapons and once again I win and you are all losers.
