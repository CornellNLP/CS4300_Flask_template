 Previously on "Wayward Pines"... 
 You didn't think Wayward Pines ran itself, did you? Hey. Who are all of these people? Volunteers. We were changing the world, and, as a result... [screeching] Oh! ...we, ourselves, were beginning to change. Testing cryonic suspension was both dangerous and illegal. They're all asleep. Yes. This isn't a little town, Ethan. This is a new civilization. You have to tell them the truth. People are fragile. They need time to adapt. Young minds are fearless. Welcome to the First Generation. They're less ingrained in the old world. They can accept the truth. There's a new threat. We don't know who they are, but they're gonna take down the fence. If they succeed... They're not going to succeed. [cranking] [ soft music playing ] It's ready. [insects chirping] Pilcher : Ethan. It is imperative you tell no one about what you've seen and what you've heard. I believe the survival of humanity may well be in our hands. [car door closes] [footsteps approaching] Ethan. When did you get back? Have you been sitting here all night? Please tell me you found something. We have got to get back to Seattle. I cannot get ahold of anybody. Mom's surgery is on Wednesday. Theresa, Theresa. There is no Seattle. What are you talking about? Look. When we were pulled from those car wrecks... ...we weren't taken directly here. We were put into some kind of a... suspended animation. [groans] What happened to your arm? [scoffs] You're gonna think I'm crazy. [sighs] But there's these creatures out there... monsters. I saw them with my own eyes. Cities destroyed. This... this fake little town is all that's left. Ethan, what did they do to you? [sighs] What did they do to you? Did they take you back to the hospital? No. I need you to try to remember if they did anything to you, if they injected you with something. You don't believe me. Are you sure? I wasn't at the hospital! [sighs] 4,028? Now, what... Okay, what does this mean? That's the date. [sighs] Ethan. [ignition buzzing] [beeping] [buzzing, beeping stop] What's wrong? It's the starter. This might take a while. You guys should walk. Okay. Sure. Let's go. Oh. Sorry, sorry. [metal creaks] [exhales sharply] [sighs] [door opens] Good morning, Mr. Burke. [sighs] Can I help you with something, Pam? No, but I think I can help  you with something. Really? Oh. Franklin Dobbs. Do you think he's involved with these subversives? I don't know. But when I find out the answer to that question, you'll be the first to know. Until then, I've got to do my job, so if you don't mind... No, I don't mind. Go ahead. Do your job. I'm just here to help. [sighs] I would do anything for my brother. Even work hand-in-hand with you. So, how about it? You can't do this alone. You need some help. I can be a very good friend. How about giving me access to the surveillance system so I can see what Franklin's been up to? S... I kind of thought we had moved past this whole "walk your kid to school" thing. [sniffs] I just wanted to spend time with you, if that's all right. Everything okay? Yeah. You ever miss Seattle? I don't really think about it. Really? Not even camping with your cousins or playing with Stanley? [laughs] Stanley. We're not supposed to think about the past. Right. Good morning. Good morning, Dr. Jenkins. Hey. I like it here, Mom. I have friends. I like school. You'd probably like it, too, if you gave it half a chance. Okay, well, I'm glad things are working out for you. Good morning, guys. Nice to see you, Theresa. Hi. Hey, Ben. Mrs. Burke. Amy, will you help Ben find a biology textbook? There's a big stack of them behind my desk. Yeah, sure. Come on. You know, I have not set foot inside that school or your classroom. Is there a tour or a parent/teacher conference coming up? School is for children, Theresa, not their parents. Your job is to feed them and keep them safe. Let us do the rest. [school bell rings] Oh, that's my cue. Nice to see you. [indistinct conversation] Yeah, it looks really bad. [gate creaks] [footsteps echoing] [thud] [metal clanging] [indistinct conversations in distance] [door creaking] [clang] [clang] [slurps] I want to thank you for coming down, Franklin. As the new Sheriff in town, I'm making a point of getting to know all the shopkeepers on Main Street. Never really had a "get to know you" meeting with Sheriff Pope. Franklin, we don't talk about the past here. You know that. [groans] Lighten up, Franklin. I'm just messing with you. Oh. [laughs weakly] But, listen, I did have something of a personal nature that I'd like to discuss with you. Gophers. Gophers? Yeah, that's right. They're destroying my lawn. And I remember looking through your file one day and it said that you worked in, uh... explosive demolition. Hmm. Afraid I c-can't help you, Sheriff. Yeah, I should really be getting back to the shop. So... [door opens, closes] Megan : Open your books to page 17. [light laughter] Go ahead and look at all the pictures. [laughter continues] Giggle if you want. For obvious reasons, your textbooks will remain here in class. Parents tend to be uncomfortable with these sorts of images. Even biology can be misunderstood. The point is, procreation is a beautiful and blessed thing. And here in Wayward Pines, that really is your most important job. Ben, Amy. Would you step up front, please? [laughter] Come on, quickly. Ahh. Behold, the male and the female. Two bodies, beautifully designed to fit together effortlessly, seamlessly. Two perfect puzzle pieces, like hand in glove. [laughter] Yes, yes, it's embarrassing to talk about. But what if... what if Ben was a bee and Amy was a flower? Well, that wouldn't be funny at all, would it? Wayward Pines needs a new generation. And one day, not too long from now, you all will have the honor of parenting the first generation of 100% originals. Now, take a look around the room. [all murmuring] This is a small town. [laughing] Right? Chances are, your mate... your co-parent [laughter] is sitting right here in this room. And it's part of my job as your teacher and counselor to help you find each other. [laughs] You two may sit down. [light laughter, murmuring] [sighs] That was weird. [whistling "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"] Ah, there you are! Nurse, could you give me a moment alone with Dr. Jenkins, please? Thank you. Wonderful news. You know, I'm doing my annual fertility consults this morning. And already, two new pregnancies. Imagine. Two new members of our First Generation. That is wonderful. David, what is it? Why are they trying to undermine us? Is it inevitable, this... passion for self-destruction? Have you eaten today? Pam... is it happening again? You always get like this. You worry so, and you forget to eat. Then once your blood sugar drops, the whole world looks gloomy, hmm? Ethan Burke will ferret out these troublemakers. Sheriff Burke will get us through this present difficulty. That's very generous of you. Oh, you believe in him. I believe in him. Dr. Jenkins? Wayne Johnson is here. Oh. Thank you, Nurse. Back to work. Great news about the pregnancies. Oh, indeed. Just be careful. All right, great. Okay. For sure. Yeah. Byebye. Morning, Ethan. Friend of yours? Oh, Franklin? Yeah. I mean, you know, it's a small town. Yeah, you guys have been seeing a lot of each other. I'm gonna need you to come with me so we can talk more... privately. Sure, what about? About the damn bomb in my truck, Harold. I-I don't know anything about this. Okay. Well, let's go to my office, and you can tell me about what you don't know. All right, let's go. [grunts] [tires screech] Don't make me subdue you again, Harold. Next time, I won't be so gentle. It's okay, folks. He tripped and fell. Let's go. Franklin made the bomb, and you or somebody who works for you planted it in my truck. I swear, I don't know anything about a bomb in your truck. But you know about the other bombs that Franklin made... the ones that are still out there. 'Cause that's what this is all about, isn't it? You want to take down the fence. Don't you want to get out? Just go somewhere, anywhere? There is no somewhere, no anywhere. [inhales deeply] I want names... [pen clicks] ...of everybody in your group, starting with your leader. Who is he? Or maybe it's a she. There's no one else. Really? I acted alone. You acted alone? Mm-hmm. So that means that you  did  plant the bomb in my truck, and you were lying about it when you denied it, but you're telling me the truth now, is that it? Great. [sighs] [pen scratching] Okay. Give this to Kate. You can go now. Um, I don't understand. I confessed. Yeah, I got it. You can go. [sighs] 
 
 [bell jingles] Morning, beautiful. Sorry I'm late. I wish I could blame it on the traffic. But somehow, I don't think that'll fly. [laughs] Good morning. You seem like you're in a great mood. Hey. Crispy like a cracker. I passed by that lot this morning, Plot 33? And I think I found something. There appears to be a substructure of some kind underneath the soil. It felt like metal. Oh, well, a water tank, maybe. Y... But it's buried in an empty lot, Bill, that... [groans] Life's full of mysteries, all chock-full of head scratchers. I wouldn't think about it too much. Besides, you really shouldn't snoop around out there. And why is that? The secret to a safe and happy town is everyone minding their own business. People need to do what they're supposed to. And not do what they're not. Right. Now, uh, I need you to go down to the hospital a bit and pick up some files for me. If... if you're not too busy. [knock on door] I got your note. I came as soon as I could. Good. Come on in. Here, sit down. Don't worry. I disabled all the surveillance in here. I thought you didn't care about that. It's not for  my  safety. Coffee? I heard about the bomb in your truck. You have to believe me. I-I don't know who did that. Good. But you can figure out who did, can't you? Because you're their leader. What if I was? Come on, Kate! Of course you are. Look, Harold was an accountant. If there's anybody leading a resistance in this town, it's not Harold, so who else is involved in this group? This group is the only thing that's kept me sane here. How long have you been active? It evolved over time. We started as something else. Just a few of us trying to connect. We'd meet in secret, just to be real with each other. Uh... Kate Hewson, um, Seattle. I miss the ferry boats, oysters, hiking Burroughs Trail. My friends. I'm, uh... I'm... I'm Franklin. [clears throat] Uh... It's all you, man. Harold Ballinger, St. Paul. Um... I have a fiancée. How come you didn't tell me any of this when I first got here? Ethan, I've been trapped here for 12 years. Try and imagine what that's like. And then you show up. And a week later, you're Sheriff? All right, look, it stops now. Why would I stop trying to escape this prison? [sighs] Look, the world that you and I knew, the world outside the fence, that no longer exists. It's not 2014. It's not... It's not even the 21st century anymore. [scoffs] What... What do you mean, it's not the 21st century anymore? [sighs] Hey. Good class today. Oh, thanks, Amy. Yeah. You and Ben look so nice together. How is that working out? It's great, actually. I really like him. Like, a lot. Oh, I'm so glad. As a teacher, it's so fulfilling when an assignment turns into something more. Yeah, he's sweet. Kind of shy. I don't think he's had much experience. You might be his first real girlfriend. I was thinking of maybe asking him out later tonight. Go some place secluded and romantic. Mm. I just... I feel like I'm ready for us to be more... intimate. He's not pressuring you? Ben? Oh, God, no. I just hope I don't have to pressure him. [laughs] I'm so happy for you. Enjoy this moment. [school bell rings] There's nothing like being young and in love. Kate : So, let me get this straight. Whoever's behind all this, the people up there pulling the strings, you work for them now? [sighs] Hand over whoever it was that planted the bomb in my truck, surrender your arms and explosives by tomorrow morning, and everything stays between us. You can't take down that fence. Okay. [door closes] [metal clangs] [footsteps approach] [knock on door] [lock clicks] [lock clicks] You were right. They got to Ethan. We have to advance the timetable. He knows about us, knows about Franklin. Exactly. We have a very narrow window. And we're not gonna get a second chance. We have to tell everyone. We execute tonight. [telephone ringing] Ballinger Toys. Oh. H-Hello, Pam. Of course. Uh, it slipped my mind completely. [chuckles] We've been backlogged with orders and... I-Is it... is it possible to reschedule? Of course, I-I understand the importance. Uh, we'll be right over. All right, then. It's our annual fertility consult. Of course it is. There's no point in making her suspicious. So... We have a married couple... young, fertile, in their prime... and yet, somehow... not pregnant. Yeah. I don't understand it. Your lab work is all good. There's no problem with the sperm count. Good. And you. Periods regular? Everything is in working order. Hmm. Hmm. Well, thanks so much for coming in. You know, I've always thought so highly of the two of you, ever since I introduced you. Hmm. I mean, what a blend of genetics. The perfect Wayward Pines couple. Hmm. Don't let me down. Woman :  Pharmacy, pick up 512. Pharmacy, pick up 512. How much time do you need to gather the team? Whatever you can give me. And get with Ted and set the backup plan in motion. Wait. Do you think we need both? We're only gonna get one shot. [elevator bell dings] [elevator bell dings] [elevator bell dings] [doors open] Kate. Do you have a minute? I'm very worried about Ethan. Come on. Okay. Kate : Did he tell you the story about it being 2,000 years in the future? How the world is destroyed, and we're the only humans left? What is going on? I don't know, but I think they have some way of brainwashing people up on that mountain. Now, I... Kate, there's more. The week after I got here, I finally found a phone that worked. I called a secure line belonging to the Service, and Agent Hassler left me a message. Adam Hassler? Mm-hmm. What did he say? That I was entering a government experiment. That I should lay low, blend in, and that I may be severely tested, possibly by another agent. You think that Ethan is... I don't know, but I can't rule it out. Theresa, you know Hassler. He is nothing if not a straight shooter. How much of this have you told Ethan? I haven't, and I'm not sure it's a good idea to. [indistinct conversation in distance] I really have to go. You're a good person, Theresa. And I wish we had met under different circumstances. I'm so sorry. Ethan, we're worried about you. You're worried about me? Yes. [sighs] What, you think this is all in my head? What do you think? [scoffs] You think, uh, I was brainwashed? I saw stuff out there, Theresa. I'm not making this up. Everything I told you is true. But you're telling me that everything is gone. [sighs] Except us. And I want to keep it that way. So please, tell me. What else did she say? She told me not to tell you anything, and then she left. She was very emotional when she said goodbye, like it was a permanent goodbye. Where's Ben? He's at school. Okay, I'm gonna go get him. I think they're planning something. Hey, so I was thinking. How about later tonight, you and I sneak out for a walk in the woods? Isn't that against the rules? Well, there are rules, and then there are  rules. There's a sweet spot I've been meaning to show you. It's like a little meadow up in the trees. How will we get there? I have a plan. Meet me after dinner? Corner of Birch and 9th? Yeah, sure. It was fun in class today, huh? I don't understand why people get so nervous talking about biology. Yeah, I... Yeah, I know, right? It's just nature. Ethan : Ben! One second. [sighs] What? Look, I'm gonna need you to come home. I'm kind of busy right now. Oh. Hi! I'll explain it to you in the car. Say goodbye. Come on, Dad. Amy, I-I'm terribly sorry, but Ben's got to come home. Okay. H-He'll talk to you later. Go ahead. Say goodbye. Sorry. I got to go. It's okay. Meet me later. [sighs] [keys jingling] [engine turns over] I just need to know, did you put that pipe bomb in the Sheriff's truck this morning? Damn it, Ted. The last thing we need is him breathing down our necks. We're not murderers. Why not? They murder. You've been to your share of reckonings. Do you want me to do this or not? [indistinct conversations] [crickets chirping] Nurse Pam : Second camera just went out at Cell 33. No, it's Kate. She's trying to throw us off. [electricity buzzing] In about 10 minutes, the guards circle around. And once that fence is breached, there's no turning back. They'll be on us... fast. [beeping] Where are the blind spots? There's one at Zone 41, right at the fence. Almost there. So if anyone's having second thoughts, now is the time to go, all right? Okay, that's it. Everybody stay right where you are! Down on the ground! Ethan! I'm not letting you blow up that fence. Get down on the ground. Okay, Franklin, disarm that bomb. Don't do it. Disarm the bomb, or she's dead. No. [gun cocks] No, Franklin. [breathing heavily] [gun cocks] No. [beeping, powering down] I trusted you. Let's go. Come on, on your feet. Let's go. [lock clicks, keys jingle] [keys jingling] [lock clicks] We had a deal, Kate. They did something to you, Ethan. You just don't know it. You'll see very soon. We will be back in Seattle, overlooking that bay. Seattle? No, forget it, Kate. That's not gonna happen. You've got to convince these people to stop this insanity! It's not gonna stop. It's just begun. Where's your husband? There's another bomb. There's a backup. Where's Harold, Kate? Where's Harold?! Amy : It should be here any second. It's always right on time, right at 8:00. We can catch it right up to the pines. Uh, we could just walk. [chuckles] [vehicle approaches] It's more fun this way. Just relax, newbie. I've done this plenty of other times. [brakes hiss, engine rumbles] [lock clicks] I need you to locate Harold. [clears throat] [keyboard clacks] Harold Ballinger. Last seen at the Biergarten less than an hour ago. Who's that? That's... Ted Laufer. He drives the delivery truck. Where is the truck now? Well, he takes the same route every day. Finishes up on 16th, heads up Main to access one, drops off the truck, and picks up another one. And where does he switch the two trucks? At the fence. [sighs] What's that? [keyboard clacking] [engine revving] [ soft music playing ] What's that? [engine revs, tires squeal] Here he comes. We got to slow him down. [tires screeching] [groaning] Man : Get up. [grunting, breathing heavily] [engine hissing] [ soft music playing ] [brakes squeaking] [music stops] [groaning] Are you okay? Amy. Amy, what are you doing here? Ben. Ben!
