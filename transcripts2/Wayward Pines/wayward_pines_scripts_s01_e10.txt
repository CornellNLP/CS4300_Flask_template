 Previously on "Wayward Pines"... 
 Class One of the Academy. 
 Well, congratulations. It's a real honor. 
 It's a responsibility. 
 And if you break the rules, you have to be reckoned. 
 Dr. Jenkins : Without Kate Ballinger, they're nothing. 
 Reckon her, and you could stop all this. 
 Look... I told you I need to do things my way. 
 You remember... as the First Generation of this town, you are a leader now. 
 Ben : They broke the rules and those rules exist for a reason... 
 Well, when is your dad gonna reckon them? 
 He's not going to. 
 [grunts] 
 We are just here to protect Wayward Pines. 
 Get out! 
 Unh! 
 Oh, God! 
 Aah! Ohh! 
 "Enjoy your life in Wayward Pines." 
 I love you. 
 [high-pitched whistling] 
 If you really want to protect them, you have to stop protecting me. 
 I can't do that. 
 You have to put an end to this. 
 There's something I have to show you. 
 It's September 15, 4020. 
 And Adam was just leading one group. 
 There are hundreds. 
 Believe me now? 
 [cheers and applause] 
 I'm not gonna kill Kate. 
 And there's one man behind it all. 
 You know him as Dr. Jenkins. But his real name is David Pilcher. [crowd gasping, keyboard clacking] What happened to the power? [key clacks] [screeching] [leaves rustling] [rumbling] [crowd murmuring] Paul, you have to calm down. It's okay. We're gonna get the power back on. We're just trying to figure it out right now, all right? All right, just... just stay calm. What the hell is going on up there? What happened to the lights? Ethan, it's Pam. David shut down the power grid. Is the power out at the fence, too? Yes. Ethan, listen. You've got to get those people off of Main. We've tracked six Abbies inside the perimeter, God knows how many more behind them. Well, how much time do we have? Just get them out of there. Copy. [murmuring continues] [gasps] I'm going to the hospital and getting Ben. All right. Good. Meet me at the bunker. All right. All right, everybody, listen up! Listen! We can't stay here. It's not safe, okay? We got to start moving east. There's an underground bunker at the corner of Boxwood and Third in a vacant lot under a shed. That's where we'll meet. Let's go. Boxwood and third! Let's go! All right. Hey, hey, hey, what happened? Pilcher. He pulled the plug. The power's down at the fence. Let's go. We got to move. Okay, we need weapons. Where's your group? Tim? Okay, you get everybody else. You meet us at the Sheriff's station, all right? [computers beeping] Show me outside the perimeter. [beeping continues] How much longer till power's restored? 20 minutes, maybe longer. I don't know if we have that long. [electricity hums] Wh-What's going on? Amy. Stop, stop. Don't... d-don't try and move. Don't try and move. I don't understand. What happened? Uh... you had to go into surgery. Th-They found some bleeding or... or something, I don't... I don't know. It's okay, though. You're okay. Okay. I was so scared. I... I didn't want to lose you. Yeah, me either. You're okay, though. [sighs] [door opens, closes] Theresa : Ben? You guys, we have to get out of here. What's going on? Can she move? I... I don't... I don't think so. I'm not leaving her. I have to stay with her, Mom. I know, sweetheart. We're not gonna leave her behind, okay? Where's Dr. Carol? [inhales sharply] [coughing] [groans] [keys jingling] Hey, what's going on out there? Is the power out at the fence? Oh, I've got this, too. Um... Franklin wasn't finished yet, but I'm pretty certain that it'll detonate. You just, uh, arm these. This might come in handy. [dog barking in distance] Man : Okay, no problem. What's going on? Thank you both. David. Pam. Wha... My dear, dear Pam. Wha... Thank goodness you're here. We need to discuss preparations for the awakening of Group "C." Group "C"? Those are our people out there. They're gonna be killed, every last one of them. You've got to turn the power back on. You've got to end this. I can't. It's too late. I-I-I wish I could, but I can't. This town we've created, Pam, it's too sick. They're already dying. I failed them. I-I failed us. They're lost, just as Group "A" was lost, but... but we  can  begin again. In the winter, once the Aberrations have migrated, then we could start again from a clean slate. No more of this... this decadence. No more Sheriff Pope or Ethan Burke. You were right about him. I was wrong. I made a mistake. And there will always be mistakes, David. But there is still time to fix this. Perhaps. Yes. If we learn, we can start again. We need to take more direct responsibility, you and I. Like the early days. We're not talking about ideas here anymore, David. We are talking about actual, living human beings! I followed you for years, down every road, blindly, but this is too far. You have not failed. Your great experiment is working. All you've got to do now is just... let it go. Turn the power back on, David. You send the guards down to help those people. Just end this. Yes. Yeah. The guards. The guards. We need the guards in here. In here? What... we don't need you in here. We need you to go down to into the... Take her to suspension. What are you doing? Come on. David! Unh! David! What?! David! [gun cocks] Guard : Everybody, hands in the air! Hands up! Up, up, up! Everybody! Hands in the air! [monitor beeping] She's doing well for a girl who just had major surgery, but we shouldn't be moving her anywhere. She's too weak. Oh, Doctor, we don't have a choice. Ben, can you grab my stuff? Okay, so, what can we do to keep her stable? [electricity hums] It's the generator. Um, I'll be right back. [sighs] I'll meet you at the bunker. Be careful. You too. All right, guys. Let's get as many people off the street as we can. Jason : Pilcher always said this day would come. He warned us that one day, there would be a day of reckoning. And on that day, he would save the First Generation. But everyone else... the weak... would drown. Just like you. Just like your husband. [gun cocks] We're done here. Hey, you can't just leave us in here! Let us out! Let us out! [generator buzzing] [key clicking] [screams] ["L'elisir d'amore: Una furtiva lagrima" plays] ♪  Una furtiva lagrima  ♪ 
♪  Negli occhi suoi spunto  ♪ [glass clinking] [people screaming] ♪  Quelle festose  ♪ [monitor beeping] [screaming continues] [grunts] [Abbies roaring] ♪  Che piu cercando io vo?  ♪ [Abby roars] [grunts] ♪  Che piu cercando io vo?  ♪ [loud clatter] [gasps] Okay. We have to go now. We have to hurry. We have to hurry. Okay? Okay, you guys? Come on. Let's go. [gasping] Go on! [people screaming] [Abby growls] [glass shattering] [breathing heavily] [Abby growls] [screaming] [Abby growls] [Abby screams] Oh! Oh! Run! Go! Now! Get to the bunker! Go! [Abbies scream] How has he convinced you to do this? Christina. I know you think you're doing your duty. But you're not. Things have gone terribly wrong. We just... Do what she says and shut your mouth. Robert, this goes for you, too. It goes for all of us. Paul. We all gave up our lives in the old world to join David Pilcher on this journey of his. And it's working. In town this year, there were more pregnancies than ever before in Wayward Pines. The future, our First Generation, that is the future for all of us, our duty to  mankind. Not to David Pilcher. David is our Savior. David is not a Savior. He's not a God. He's just a man. And he's made a mistake. But we can reverse this mistake. There's still time. We can turn it around if we work togeth... [gasps] Pam! [groans] [all gasp] Sir, maybe... You should shut your mouth, too. Now... put on your suits. Or we'll put them on for you. [people screaming, gunfire] [footsteps approach] [metal clangs] [glass shatters] Sean : Charlie! Hey, keys. Where are the keys? The keys? In the gun locker over there! Hurry! Mike! [keys jingle] Come on. [sighs] You all right? Yeah. Yeah? Did everyone make it to the Ark? Most. Abbies are everywhere out there now. We should stay here. No, we can't. We can't. Remember, Pilcher entrusted us with the future of Wayward Pines. We have to make it to the Ark. Everything depends on it... everything. [Abbies screaming] [people screaming] [gun clicks] Man : Behind you! Tim! Run! My gun is jammed. I'm fine. Go! [Abby roars] Headed your way! [gasping] [Abby growling] [breathing heavily] [Abby screeching] [gunfire] [wood creaking] [heavy footsteps] [Abby roars] [gasping] [Abby screaming] [grunting] [panting] Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hang on a second. Okay. [gasps] Oh, my God. [all breathing heavily] Shh. It's okay. Shh. Shh. [Amy breathing shakily] [screams, whimpers] Stay there. [Abby roars] Mom! [Abby screams] Ah! [Amy whimpers] Is everyone okay? Yeah. Let's go. Come on. Ethan : Hurry up. Come on. [gasping] [breathing heavily] [Abby groaning] [Abby snarling] [gasps] Tim. [Abby growling] [all shouting] Whew! 
 
 [brakes squeak] Ethan : Be careful going down. All right. I got you. [sighs] Ready. Okay. There you are. Come on. They're coming. [breathing heavily] [sighs] Okay. Those tunnels... where do they lead to? [sighs] I have no idea what you're talking about. Don't play dumb with me. You've been with him since the beginning. Where do they go? I don't know. Do you want everyone in here to die? Because that's what's gonna happen. The best thing we can do right now is stay calm. David  will  rescue us. Rescue us?! What the hell are you talking about?! He wants us dead. You're lying! Ben : No, he's not. You said yourself that Pilcher watches over us. So if he didn't do this, where is he? How come we weren't warned? David did this. You've said this town is an ark. One crack, and we all drown. He is drowning us. Where do they go? Megan? We have no time. There's a western tunnel. It leads to an elevator. I know the code. It will take you to the Mountain Complex... to David. Good. Theresa. We'll be right back. [sighs] Ethan : All right. This is it. How are we on ammo? Uh, I've got two mags. I've still got these pipe bombs. We got to get everybody moving now. What if Pilcher sees us coming? It doesn't matter. We either deal with him or we deal with them. Let me get the others. All right. Here. Come back here. [door opens] [inhales sharply] Ow. All right, that's it. [sighs] I'm sorry about Harold. Thank you. You really loved him, huh? You know, Pam set us up. [chuckles] We couldn't have been more different. Seems impossible to think that we could, uh... Anyway, um... sometimes things just work out, I guess. Sometimes people surprise you. That's the safety. You just flip it up and it's ready to go. Okay. Um... Dad, I just wanted to say I'm sorry about before. At the hospital, I said some stuff... I heard what you said. Look. [sighs] You're my son. I love you. We're gonna get through this. Okay? Okay. [sighs] All right, everybody, let's clear out. Let's go. Come on. Woman : Yeah. Careful. Come here. Come on. Megan, come on! I saw Reed and Tristan and Sarah out on Main Street. I'm sure there are others. If they're not here, they didn't make it. You don't know that. If they come, they won't be able to get in and they'll die out there. Someone has to stay behind. Someone has to let them in. Megan, Megan, no. I made a promise to the First Generation... a promise that they would be protected. You need to make sure the children get into the Mountain Complex. You need to make sure they're safe. I'll meet you there. [inhales deeply] [door opens, closes] Young woman : I can't believe it. It's Jason! Oh. Oh, Jason. [panting] [door closes] [beeping] Jason : Pilcher planned for a flood like this. He left this... everything we could ever need. [all murmuring] [baby cries] [gasps] [keypad beeping] [elevator whirring] Kate and I are gonna go check it out. I'll call you on this. Don't worry. We'll be fine. We're gonna have to do this in groups. We're gonna send it back down as soon as we know it's safe, all right? [keypad beeping] Sleep tight. You ready? Ready. [gunfire] Guard : Shots fired. Follow me! Shots fired, northeast wing. Move up! [monitor beeping] [keyboard clacking] Wake her up. What the hell do you think... I said wake her up. Take that side. Okay. On your right! Hey. Freeze! Down on the ground! Drop your weapons! Drop it. Kate : On the floor! Drop it! [groans] Damn it. Now. Don't move. [handcuffs clicking] All right, Theresa. We're good. Get everybody in the elevator. [keypad beeping] [loud crash] [pounding on door] [Abbies roaring] Come on. Let's go. Go! Go! I'll see you soon! Ben, wait! Go! Go! Go! Wait! [Abbies roaring] [pounding on door] [Abbies roaring] Stop! Man : That's it! That's it! Wait for the next load. Okay. [Abbies growling, panting] [indistinct shouting] Go! Be careful now. Kate : We go to go. Let's go. There you go. Straight ahead, guys. We can't wait! We cannot wait! Let's go! [Abbies snarling] Where's Theresa? Where's Ben? Oh, I haven't seen 'em yet. Ethan, they're still down there. And the Abbies are inside. Give me the bag. Ethan... Give me the bag. Ethan... wait! Just be careful. Find Pilcher. Make him turn on the power. [Abbies snarling] [gun clicks] Ben! Let's go! [Abbies screaming] [Abbies growling, snarling] [keypad beeps] [pounding] Okay. How high are we going? Ethan : All the way to the top of the Mountain. You okay, sweetie? [metal banging] What the hell was that? [Abbies snarling, growling] Dad, they're in the shaft. What? Dad, we have to get out. [banging] [Abbies snarling] Ben, Ben, take this. Huh? [Abbies screaming] What do you see up there? There's a ladder! I see the door. [Abbies roaring] [all grunting] You ready? Uh-huh. [breathing heavily] You okay? Yeah? What's taking them so long? [all grunting] Promise me you two are gonna stay close, okay? [sighs] Okay. Let's go. [Abbies snarling, growling] Dad, grab my hand. Come on. Go ahead. I'm right behind you. No, Dad. Just come up, please. Ben, come on. We got to work as a team here. We got to keep those things from coming up. Dad... Your mother, Amy, those people... they're counting on you, okay? Just... just go. I'm right behind you. Now go! Go! [Abbies roaring] [electricity crackles] [people murmuring] [banging on door] Woman : Open the door! Let's go. [murmuring continues] [grunting] Come on. All right. Come on. David : They're going to get up the shaft, Ethan. And they're gonna kill everyone. I warned you that revealing the truth would be the death of Wayward Pines. But you wouldn't listen. [panting] The power to the fence. Turn it back on. No one else has to die, David. You can still do the right thing. I've dedicated my entire life to those people. Who are you to come in here and tell me what's right or wrong? You're only here because I chose you... both of you. [Abbies snarling] What neither of you ever understood is that this town is not about any one individual. It's not about freedom. It's about something much greater than that. It's about the preservation of mankind. I have sacrificed everything to sow the seeds for its future, to protect it. Enlightenment is coming. My ideas will live on long after I'm gone. No. Your ideas end here. [breathing heavily] Go ahead. Kill me. You can't kill my ideas. They're everywh... [gunshot, shell casing clinks] [gasps] I'll try and get the power back on. Amy. Ben. [electricity crackles] [Abbies growling] [bombs whirring] [Abbies screaming] Dad? [crying] Dad? Dad! How's Ben? Kate : He's... still unconscious. I'm looking for beds. People are tired. They need to sleep. Oh, there are beds in the east wing. And how about food, water? Of course. I'll get that organized. Pam? Yeah. I want to help. And, uh, at the risk of sounding redundant, I'm better with more information. Nurse Pam : Quite a sight, isn't it? What is all this? The rest of the population, the ones who haven't woken yet. [beeping] Careful. I might take you seriously. I mean it, Kate. I'm telling you the truth. You and I have never said one true thing to each other. Well, let's start now, then, huh? Nurse Pam : If we are going to survive, we're gonna have to make it better. No more lies. No more surveillance. No more reckonings. If we work together, I believe it is possible. I believe we  can  succeed. We have to. This is it. This is all that's left. This is the last of humanity. Woman : Mr. Burke? Mr. Burke? [monitor beeping] Where am I? Wayward Pines, of course. Where is everyone? Why are you dressed like that? Uh, I'm a nurse here now. Uh, I don't understand. I graduated two months ago. I am more than qualified, Mr. Burke. Why are you calling me that? Graduated? How long was I unconscious? Dr. Woodard will be in to see you shortly. You can ask him any questions you like, okay? I'm just gonna take your blood pressure. Amy... how long? Three years, four months. What? Three years? Ben, please. Please be quiet, okay? They're listening. After your accident, they put you back into suspension with the rest of the adults. I tried to get them to take you out earlier, but they wouldn't allow it. They're angry at your father. What? They blame him for the Savior's death. They think you're like him. But I told them, I convinced them... you're not like him. You're different. Where are my clothes? Ben, Ben, wait, please. Where are my clothes? Ben, they're watching. And they will put you back into suspension with the adults. Amy, where are my clothes? [crying] Ben! Ben! [indistinct conversations, birds chirping] [bell jingles] [children laughing] [carnival music playing] [bicycle bell rings]
