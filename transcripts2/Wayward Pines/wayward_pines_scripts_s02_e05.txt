 It is the year 4032. 
 Man's destruction of the environment has created evolutionary aberrations... known as "Abbies," 
 (screeching) 
 ...that rule the earth. 
 One man saw the catastrophe coming. 
 He created an ark for mankind and selected a chosen few to sleep for 2,000 years, and defy mankind's extinction. 
 Surrounded by mountains, and protected by an electric fence, the last of humanity left alive on Earth do their best to survive in a town called Wayward Pines. 
 Previously on Wayward Pines... 
 Jason : Pilcher sent a dozen nomads in a dozen directions out beyond the fence. 
 And Adam's the only one who's ever returned. 
 Jason : They're gone. 
 This is a rare opportunity. 
 With the Abbies retreated, we can work without fear. 
 I want to come with you. 
 Let me find my son. 
 (growling and snarling) 
 (sniffling) 
 But every time one thing here seems almost rational, two things pop up that make absolutely no sense at all. 
 Every member of our community has a duty to ensure the future of the human race. 
 Lucy has a choice. 
 Actually, Rebecca, she really doesn't. 
 (crying): I don't want to be a mom. 
 Frank, help me with your sister. 
 You told her. 
 The Abbies are gone, Doctor. 
 But we have a chance to secure our future and start forging a new path. 
 You're underestimating them. 
 (Abbies growling) 
 (alarm ringing) 
 Theo : Please don't go to work today. 
 Sorry. I have to. 
 We should go someplace. 
 Galapagos. 
 Machu Picchu. 
 I can't tell if you're actually being serious. 
 Oh, I am. Those are real places. 
 (scoffs) Those places are very far away. 
 Theo? 
 How about a beach? 
 Hawaii. 
 Honey, we're going to Hawaii. 
 Can you pull the projected estimates for the Peterson Project? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I was told to give all the materials to Alex. 
 What? To Alex? 
 No, he hasn't been brought up to speed. 
 I think they're going with his proposal. 
 So they're stealing my project away from me? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Push everything. I want the entire team on a conference call right away, okay? 
 There's a man in your office. 
 He wouldn't wait at reception. 
 Rebecca Yedlin? 
 David Pilcher. 
 Tell me, is that Piers Park? 
 My father used to take me sailing there. 
 Mr. Pilchner... 
 Pilcher. 
 Right. 
 Maybe you've heard of my book. 
 The Coming Crisis: Human Adaptation to Environmental Pressure. 
 What is it that you want? 
 Yes. Yes, of course. 
 Uh... Well, I'd like you to consider a project. 
 An ambitious project. 
 Something historic. 
 And what kind of a building would that be? 
 Let me tell you about it over dinner. 
 Pilcher : Montrachet. 
 The most noble of the white Burgundies. 
 Californian Chardonnay presents right from the bottle. 
 Instant gratification for the American palate. 
 It should be about what ages, what lasts. 
 My Harvard thesis. 
 I haven't seen this in years. 
 You thought your title was bad? 
 How did you get this? 
 I surround myself with people who are very good at getting me things I want. 
 This is quite impressive. 
 You're a fan of Henry Clubb, I see. 
 He's the reason I'm an architect. 
 In 1856, he built a settlement called the... 
 The Octagon City. 
 Yes, I know. 
 And it failed. 
 Yes. 
 What if we were to have a second chance? 
 To start over... with a small, enlightened community? 
 That grew gradually, until it became the most essential, the most significant community that the world had ever known. 
 You'd want to be a part of that, wouldn't you? 
 I think anyone would. 
 You'd be surprised. 
 I believe the flood is coming, Rebecca. 
 It will make all things new. 
 We need an ark. 
 I need you to design it. 
 What you're proposing sounds... 
 Crazy. Yes, I know. 
 You got to get used to people looking at you as a crackpot. 
 False prophet. 
 It can weigh you down. 
 Weigh anyone down. 
 But if you believe in something. If you... truly believe, then you'll fight for it. 
 I was going to say what you're proposing sounds expensive. 
 I would be willing to pay whatever it takes. 
 I'm prepared to give my last dime for this. 
 I am searching for dreamers like myself. 
 Are you a dreamer, Rebecca? 
 Wouldn't you like the opportunity... 
 ...to build the city you've always dreamt of building? 
 A legacy beyond compare.

 Kerry : Units are on the way. 
 Jason : Block off Main Street. 
 Yes, sir. 
 No one sees this. 
 I'm on it. 
 How'd it get in? 
 Are there others? 
 We don't know yet. 
 Why isn't it attacking? 
 (tires squealing) 
 After we kill it, we'll do a sweep. 
 (shouting) 
 Move, move, move! 
 (Abby growling) 
 Kill it? 
 Kerry : We shouldn't kill it. This one's different. 
 Look. 
 It's the first female we've ever seen. 
 Theo : It's a town. 
 Rebecca : With a real Main Street. 
 Is that a Biergarten? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So now, I know what keeps you up at 4:00 a.m. 
 It's Biergartens. 
 It's designed for happiness. 
 You make things work on the inside; I make things work on the outside. 
 We both make a difference. 
 (chuckles) 
 Guess I'm just a little concerned. 
 Why? 
 Mr. Right strolls into your office with a golden ticket, gigantic commission, asking you to... build Mayberry, and that just doesn't make sense to me. 
 I don't want you to get hurt. 
 We both know that utopia can't exist. 
 Please, leave me alone, I just want to work right now. 
 (pencil scratching) 
 (slams pencil) 
 Hey, you feeling the love? 
 You beat up that Abby. 
 Actually, it was more like... 
 Hey, every girl in the school is locked in on you. 
 Nah. 
 (laughs) 
 (students chattering) 
 (baby crying) 
 Okay, see you. 
 Megan : She's been strangely passive since she's arrived. 
 There are no signs of malnutrition, and the X-rays look normal, but we're just getting started. 
 We wanted to wait until the effects of the tranquilizer you shot her with fully wore off before we started any blood work. 
 Our other Abbies seemed to have calmed down since she got here. 
 Oh, there is this, though. 
 What is it? 
 Well, we're not sure. 
 It's not natural, nor does it look like the combat scarring we've seen on some of the males. 
 It might be something anthropological. 
 Anthropological? 
 They're not a lost tribe. 
 They're animals. 
 Gonna check the Pilcher research again. 
 But there isn't much on the females, is there? 
 The Abbies that breached the fence on Invasion Day, those were all males. 
 I mean, we knew the females were out there, obviously, and as with any species they're different. 
 We just don't know how different. 
 Maybe I can unearth something that will help us. 
 Understand them? 
 Kill them, once and for all. 
 Jason : Keep me posted. 
 LAB TECH: Margaret sure seems to be handling all this pretty well. 
 "Margaret"? (chuckles) 
 You named her? 
 I name all my Abbies. 
 The big one's Dennis. 
 He was a bully. 
 That one's Max. 
 Another bully. 
 He hated high school. 
 Me, too. 
 My ex-girlfriend... whenever I apologized, she just stared at me. 
 So I named her Margaret. 
 I'm sorry, Margaret. 
 We completed the sweep on the town. 
 No other Abbies were found. 
 Good and the fence? 
 The fence is secure. 
 Then can you explain to me how an Abby ended up on our carousel on Main Street? 
 Maybe she was here all along. 
 She's docile. She could have went undetected. 
 Kerry : Maybe when the fence was opened and the explorers left? 
 Or someone helped it. 
 Who would do that? 
 Keep working on it. 
 You could help those two with the water samples if it's not too much trouble. 
 You got a shovel handy? 
 'Cause I could help you dig some graves. 
 Is that why you came back? 
 To preach the end of the world? 
 'Cause none of us intend to die out here. 
 When they come... it won't matter. 
 Pines have a life expectancy of over 5,000 years. 
 It's a terrible thing to outlive everything around you, isn't it? 
 Nature is cruel that way. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm not going back, CJ. 
 We can't be completely sure if the Abbies are gone. 
 You should go back where it's safe. 
 No, I've made my decision; I'm staying here. 
 It's safer inside. 
 Ben's out here. 
 And I'm never gonna leave my son again. 
 I'm-I'm still his mother. 
 I don't need your protection. 
 You might have to tell him the same thing. 
 That man is the reason why my whole family is dead. 
 Yes... but he's also the reason why you're still alive. 
 First time in Idaho? 
 Yeah, it's beautiful. 
 Across here. 
 Oh, wow. 
 This is where we will build our tomorrow. 
 Unfortunately, all these trees will have to go, except for the pines. 
 They age better. 
 Looks like there's a town already there. 
 Not for long. 
 I'd like for you to meet the rest of the team. 
 Everyone... 
 Ah. meet our architect. 
 Hi. 
 This is Rebecca. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 I'm Megan. 
 I loved your plans. 
 The way you put the cars and the garages in the back of the houses. 
 It's just so elegant, and with everything close by, who needs to drive anyway? 
 I mean, it's such an obvious way to encourage socialization... but still... kudos. 
 Thank you. 
 Is that where we'll build our base of operations? 
 Pilcher : Well, we've already started. 
 It's on the other side of the mountain. 
 But you'll have... you'll have ample time to explore up there after dinner tonight. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Hey, Jason. 
 (bell dinging) 
 Rebecca, as you may have heard, the Abby on Main Street was the only one. 
 Good news. 
 You designed this place. 
 Now I need your help. 
 It's my job to keep this town safe. 
 Are you sure the fence is impenetrable? 
 The fence is secure. 
 What if you're wrong? 
 Then we're dead. 
 My designs are not the problem here, Jason. 
 How are things at home? 
 Fine. 
 Good. 
 Good. 
 Then I trust you told him everything? 
 It's not good to keep secrets, Rebecca.

 There aren't cameras.

 (chuckling): Yeah, yeah, I'm just-I'm just a little... a little nervous, it's fine. 
 Well, we could go straight to "P" if you want... 
 No. I-I mean, it's, you know, it's just... it's just this setup. 
 Uh... should... um... let me... 
 Uh, uh... 
 Just-just forget it. 
 What? 
 I get it. 
 Okay? You don't like me. 
 No. I mean... w-wait. Th-that's not... 
 Then what is it? 
 You're right. 
 We're not a good match. 
 I-I'm more into blondes, anyway. 
 Yeah, well, maybe you're not a good match for anyone. 
 Don't worry. I'll let them know. 
 (door opens) 
 (door slams) 
 Is he in? 
 Yes, he's in. 
 But he's very busy. 
 And unfortunately, we're not accepting any new walk-ins at this time. 
 You asked to see me? 
 I heard you caught one of those creatures in the middle of town. 
 We did. 
 She's secure in the lab. 
 Still alive? 
 Yes. 
 You said "she." How do you know that? 
 It doesn't take a gynecologist, Dr. Yedlin. 
 So you have a real lab here? 
 In the mountain, yes. 
 We've been studying the males, but this could be a real opportunity. 
 We've never caught a female. 
 Never even seen one. 
 Little more the left, I think, there. 
 So who's running your scientific research team? 
 Because if somebody has the appropriate training, I have yet to meet them. 
 Well, it's not your training, either. 
 Unless you've completed a veterinary rotation, I'm not aware of. 
 You need someone who understands protocols, medical ethics. 
 Unless those are part of the old rules that Wayward Pines seems exempt from. 
 Well, there are plenty of things we're grateful to leave behind. 
 But in this case, yes. 
 The old rules should still apply. 
 Wonderful. 
 Put me in charge then. 
 Of the research. 
 You need someone who's qualified. 
 I could do that. 
 But if I support this, and it moves forward, you may step on some toes. 
 Great. 
 Just let me know when you'd like to start, and I'll introduce you to your team. 
 (Margaret growling) 
 Megan : Dr. Yedlin. 
 Please, come. 
 We're about to extract some cerebrospinal fluid. 
 Would you like to observe? 
 Why isn't she sedated? 
 It's also a study of the pain reflex. 
 We need to know if pain can be used as a deterrent. 
 She can be monitored, but she's not to be touched in any way. 
 Dr. Yedlin will be joining your team, Megan. 
 I'll actually be leading it, per our agreement. 
 Oh. 
 Does Jason know about this? 
 Jason is on board. And Dr. Yedlin is a world-class surgeon who's received numerous awards and fellowships. 
 Learning as much as we can, as quickly as we can, is what's best for Wayward Pines. 
 I'll leave you two to your work. 
 I'm sure a world-class surgeon and a world-class hypnotherapist have a lot to talk about. 
 Excuse me. Did she say "hypnotherapist"? 
 That was a long time ago. 
 I have completed many years of study and research since then. 
 I'll be by tomorrow morning. We'll lay out a proper set of protocols. 
 Wonderful. I look forward to it. 
 (door opens) 
 (door closes) 
 Do it. 
 (indistinct conversation) 
 (classical music playing) 
 (glass clinking) 
 First of all, I would like to say how ecstatic I am about all the work you've done. 
 When we first met, you told me that you wanted to blow up the world and start over. 
 Well, believe me, you're well on the way. 
 Your designs are amazing. 
 Rebecca : Thank you. 
 Thank you, David. 
 Thank you. 
 I do have a-a confession to make. 
 It's important you understand the full scope of our plans. 
 Okay. Terrific. 
 Construction on the designs that you've laid out, will-will not take place for some time. 
 Are we looking at a year? 
 Five years? 
 (laughter) 
 This wine we're drinking... Nerello... it's from Mt. Etna. 
 It's my favorite wine. 
 Grown on the side of a volcano, but what is it about this wine that makes it so special? 
 Is it the grape or the vintner? 
 Or is it the climate? 
 No. It's the soil. 
 The product of dozens, hundreds of eruptions over thousands of years constantly transforming the chemical and mineral makeup of that soil. 
 And yet, after all that turbulence and upheaval, after that violence, and destruction, (chuckles) nature leaves us with a beautiful and delicious gift. 
 The timing, the location, were crucial. 
 Megan : The next cataclysmic disaster is right around the corner. 
 And the only way to ensure our survival, is to slingshot past the event. 
 A select group of volunteers, all true believers, will be put into cryogenic pods, housed in this very facility. 
 Where we will sleep for 2,000 years. 
 When we awake, all our algorithms tell us the threat will have passed, and we will build our Utopia. 
 Your Utopia. 
 Megan : The earth will be ready to begin again. 
 Now, Rebecca, I'm sure you have hundreds, thousands, of questions (laughs) about all of this. 
 We'll be happy to elucidate you on the details, but I thought it was important at this stage to... to bring you up to speed. 
 It is my hope that you will be my partner and collaborator, as we witness the birth of this new world. 
 Uh... (chuckles) this is, uh, uh, it's a lot to absorb. 
 Uh, of course, I'm... 
 I'm honored to be a part of this. 
 And I can't wait. 
 And this is, uh... 
 It's a very bold plan. It's amazing. 
 Hey, how did it all go? 
 I can't. 
 Bec, tell me. 
 What if you made an error of judgment? 
 What if... okay, just bear with me. 
 What if you made a mistake, and you couldn't find a way out of it? 
 He's not for real, is he? 
 I wish he wasn't. 
 I was so worried that something like this could happen. 
 I just wish I'd never gotten involved with this. 
 I just feel like such a failure. 
 You haven't failed. 
 Just tell them you're out. 
 They come after you, fine. I'll take care of it. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hospital. 
 I got to go back. 
 We're gonna get through this. 
 We are. 
 Theresa : I had a dream last night. 
 I went back and I walked into the house, and Ben was there, and he ran right into my arms and... 
 Ethan was really upset, but he was happy that I was home. 
 There is nothing left for me inside that fence. 
 Theresa... 
 ...you weren't supposed to follow him. 
 I could've taken care of you, but you ended up here. 
 You and Ben. 
 (sighs) And I had-I had to follow you. 
 Adam, what are you saying? 
 I wanted Ethan gone. 
 I know it was wrong. 
 I don't expect you to forgive me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I was in the procreation room. 
 With Meadow. 
 I couldn't get past K. 
 I wasn't into it. 
 That happens. 
 Meadow, Ashley. 
 I mean I wasn't into it. 
 No, I mean, I... 
 I don't know, they-they put you in this crazy room and you have to remember all these steps, you know. 
 (stammers) Do you think that's it? 
 That I just forgot some of the steps? I mean... (stammers) 
 I don't know if there's... 
 You think maybe you're gay? 
 I'm not gay at all. 
 I'm, like, the opposite of gay. 
 I'm feeling very un-gay right now. 
 The word doesn't just mean happy. 
 Has no one ever discussed this with you? 
 Discussed what? 
 Same-sex attraction. 
 Doctor, please. 
 There is nothing wrong with you. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm just gonna tell them... Y-you have to give me, you have to give me something. 
 Can you give me something? A-a pill, or some kind of treatment? 
 Frank, just calm down. 
 No, please! 
 Look... 
 (sighs) 
 Can you tell them that I'll do it again next time, and I'll remember all the steps? I'll do everything, I promise. 
 Frank, you don't need anything. 
 There are rules, okay? I have to reproduce. 
 It's-it's my glorious obligation. 
 But if I'm sick, and they find out that I can't do it... 
 ...they'll kill me. 
 I won't let that happen. 
 Rebecca. 
 (sighs) Tell him. 
 Why are you here? 
 (softly): Tell him. 
 Xander and I are married. 
 He's my husband. 
 I was kidnapped... and put to sleep. 
 When I woke up, you weren't here. 
 I was all alone in this mess. 
 I didn't know what to make of this place... how to survive in this town. 
 I thought you were dead. 
 So you marry him? 
 They match people together, we don't... 
 Hey, stop talking. 
 How long? 
 One year. 
 But we haven't been together for six months. No. 
 Oh, geez. 
 Theo, please try to understand. 
 Theo : What? 
 That you married another man while I was a popsicle? 
 Or that you've lied to me since the moment I woke up? 
 I haven't been lying. 
 I just didn't want to overwhelm you. 
 But you dragged me into the bed that you shared with him. 
 (sighs) 
 This is not her fault, man. 
 (grunting) 
 Theo! 
 Oh, God. 
 You all right? 
 (door opens) 
 (sighs) 
 So, this is where you hide. 
 You're, uh, you're not gonna jump off are you? 
 Very funny. 
 You ever wonder what's out there? 
 All the time. 
 They tell us not to think about it, and I try not to think about it. 
 But sometimes I see it in my dreams. 
 (sighs) Where no one's telling us what to do all our lives. 
 Where I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life washing people's hair. 
 Hey, at least you have a job. 
 I'm still unassigned. 
 You're lucky. 
 I doubt it. 
 I'm sorry, Luce. 
 I know. 
 I'm having a really hard time right now. 
 I'll protect you, Frank. 
 You're my kid sister. 
 I think I'm supposed to be protecting you. 
 I'll protect you. 
 Thank you. 
 (heart monitor beeping steadily) 
 (growling) 
 Don't worry, no more tests for now. 
 They haven't taught us anything yet anyway. 
 And I guess we'll see what surprises a certain someone has in store for us both tomorrow morning. 
 We were never supposed to meet. 
 Did you know that? 
 Pilcher thought we would wake up, and, yes, you'd have been here, but you would be gone, and the Earth would belong to us again. 
 I remember waking up on a gurney in a hospital. 
 After I'd been attacked... and trampled... and left for dead. 
 Before my husband died. 
 He tried to put me back together again. 
 (sighs deeply) 
 I miss him. 
 You see? I can still feel some things. 
 Why am I talking to you? You can't understand me, can you? 
 You're just an animal. 
 Aren't you, Margaret? 
 Hassler : I can go. 
 No, it's fine. 
 I was remembering the day that Ben was born. 
 And he came out... screaming. 
 And he looked right at me... 
 ...and he took his little, tiny... palm and he just smacked me right in the cheek. 
 (chuckles) 
 It was the first thing he did. 
 (crying): I can't stop thinking about him being out here alone and so scared. 
 (sniffling) 
 No mother should ever have to outlive her child. 
 (sighs) 
 I know why you don't want to return to Wayward Pines. 
 You're out here 'cause you want to die. 
 And I've been there. 
 Every day I would just say, "This is it. This is how it ends." 
 But I made peace with it. 
 I don't have any more questions. 
 I said everything that I was meant to say in coming back. 
 I just want you to forgive me. 
 We're all out here stuck together. 
 I can talk to you, I can do that. 
 But I will never ever be able to forgive you.
