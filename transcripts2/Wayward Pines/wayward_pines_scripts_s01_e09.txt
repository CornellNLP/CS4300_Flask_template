 Previously on "Wayward Pines"... 
 Theresa, there's been an accident. 
 I want whatever's left of the car transferred here. 
 We're taking over the investigation. 
 I don't know where Ethan is. That is the truth. 
 Ethan Burke for Adam Hassler. 
 Marcy : He's not available at the moment. 
 If there's time, I want to call it off. 
 But it's done, Adam. 
 [grunts] 
 Help! I need a doctor! 
 What happened? 
 The truck exploded. 
 People are gonna want to hear from you. 
 What does it matter what I think? 
 Ben, you survived a terrorist attack. 
 You're a hero now. 
 Give me a reading on Ruby's chip. 
 She's at home in bed. 
 She must have taken her chip out last night and left it in her room. 
 I wonder how many more people are home in bed. 
 What happened at the fence? 
 Two got away, four got taken... and Kate's in jail. 
 Ethan : Your husband blew up a truck last night on Main Street. 
 Nearly killed my son. 
 I'm so sorry, Ethan. 
 Something must have gone wrong with the timer. 
 It was... it was meant to go off a-at the fence. 
 Alan : I say we just keep driving till we hit San Francisco. 
 This time tomorrow, we'll be drinking beers by the Bay, man. 
 I can't. 
 Come on! All right! 
 [laughs] We made it! 
 [laughs] 
 [snarls] 
 [screeches] 
 [telephone rings] 
 [telephones ringing] 
 [cheers and applause] 
 Kill her! 
 Yeah! 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 [applause] 
 Woman : Kill her! 
 Is this what you want? 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 Do it! Do it! 
 Is this really what you want?! 
 [snarling] 
 [hisses] 
 [munching] 
 [sniffs] 
 [sniffing] 
 [snarling] 
 [screeches] 
 [snarling] 
 [screeches] 
 Hey! 
 [knock on door] 
 Where'd you go? 
 You said you were gonna bring us some food! 
 God. 
 I can't take another minute of this. 
 I'm gonna lose it, I swear. 
 Franklin! 
 Stop. 
 You're making everybody nervous. 
 Well, shouldn't we be? 
 Where the hell is Harold and the rest of them? 
 Uh, thankfully, not in here. 
 Maybe they actually made it out. 
 Or maybe they're dead just like us. 
 We're not dead. 
 Well, we're as good as. 
 The only reason we're not is because the Sheriff's busy. 
 If he wasn't busy, he'd probably drag us right out onto Main Street, slit our throats, wouldn't he? 
 Ethan is not Pope. He's not gonna do that. 
 Yeah, you're probably right. He'll probably just shoot us. 
 Franklin! 
 You add to that the fact that we just about killed his little kid, you think this guy's gonna let us live? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I-I do. 
 What makes you so sure? 
 Because I know him. 
 No, you don't. 
 You  knew  him. The guy you knew is gone. 
 Now he works for Wayward Pines. 
 He's just a patsy, working like everybody else, taking orders, collecting a paycheck. 
 No. No, no, no, no, no. 
 We're dead. We're dead. 
 Yeah. 
 Excuse me. 
 Excuse me. You cannot go in there. 
 We're looking for the Sheriff. 
 [door closes] 
 Yeah, well, he's not in right now. 
 Well, where is he? 
 Well, it's none of your business. 
 Oh, I think it is. 
 Class One of the Academy. 
 Well, congratulations. It's a real honor. 
 It's not an honor. 
 It's a responsibility. 
 See, we take the rules of this town seriously, unlike your boss. 
 Excuse me, but Ethan Burke takes the rules of the town very seriously. 
 Then why is he sheltering terrorists? 
 I thought blowing up kids was against the rules. 
 Wouldn't you say so, Sean? 
 They put Amy in the hospital. 
 I'd say that's against the rules. 
 And if you break the rules, you have to be reckoned. 
 That's the Sheriff's duty. 
 What the Sheriff does and doesn't do is none of your damn business. 
 See, that's where you're wrong. 
 The future of this town is in our hands, not yours. 
 And not your Sheriff's. 
 So, you tell him... if he doesn't do what he needs to do, if he doesn't reckon those traitors soon, someone's gonna do it for him. 
 I will tell him no such thing. 
 Now you skedaddle, or I'm having the three of you locked up. 
 Do you hear me? 
 "Skedaddle"? 
 You really want to put us in a cell with those traitors? 
 Get the hell out of here. 
 Did you hear me? 
 I said get the hell out of here. 
 Come on, Jason. Let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 You tell him. 
 [door closes] 
 [indistinct conversations] 
 Ethan. 
 We got this under control. 
 Under control? 
 They've breached the perimeter. 
 We're fortunate to still be alive. 
 You have to stop this  now. 
 I will. 
 [sighs] 
 I've got Harold in custody. 
 I'll get him to talk and find out where the others are. 
 Yes, you said that before. 
 They put your son in the hospital, and now... now this? 
 This happened because they didn't know what was really out there, because you didn't tell them. 
 No. 
 No, this happened because what you're doing isn't working anymore. 
 The people of Wayward Pines are familiar with a certain way of life, a way of life where people who break the rules are punished. 
 They're gonna demand retribution, release. 
 And if you deny them that, then they're gonna take the law into their own hands. 
 More deaths will follow. 
 You have to act decisively and swiftly to stop all this. 
 This group... they're weak. They're reckless. 
 Why have they taken so long to do all this? 
 Why? 
 Because they're doing what their leader told them. 
 Without Kate Ballinger, they're nothing. 
 Reckon her, and you could stop all this. 
 Look... 
 I told you I need to do things my way. 
 If you could have killed the Easter bomber before he acted, would you? 
 Don't make the same mistake twice. 
 Don't wait till it's too late. 
 Just consider... one life to save Wayward Pines. 
 [grunting] 
 Sit down, Harold. 
 I want to see my wife. 
 We're gonna have a little chat first. 
 I'm not talking till I see Kate. 
 What, are you gonna call your lawyer? 
 Come on. Sit down. 
 You know, I think it's strange, you being so worried about Kate when she's all cozy in a cell. 
 Alan... that's the one I'd be worried about. 
 What happened to Alan? 
 Well, he made it past the fence. 
 He made it? 
 Yeah. About 50 yards. 
 And here's Eric. 
 Or maybe  that's  Alan and  that's  Eric. 
 It's hard to tell. 
 What did you do to them? 
 Does it look like I did this? 
 Harold, if I want to kill somebody, I'm gonna shoot them. 
 I'm not gonna eat them. 
 That fence that your friends tried to destroy... it's there for a reason... because there are things beyond it, things a lot worse than me. 
 That's a lie. You're lying. 
 Then what do you think that is? 
 You think that's a leg, or you think that's an arm? 
 Look, you don't have to believe me. 
 I'm either a-a psychopathic cannibal, or maybe... What... Maybe I'm telling the truth. 
 Any way you slice it, I don't see where you have much of a choice. 
 I need names of everyone in your group. 
 And what happened here to your friends is gonna happen to every single person in this town... including you and your wife. 
 Do you understand? 
 Do you understand me? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Names. 
 [sighs] 
 Nurse Pam : Theresa? 
 How's he doing? 
 He's... he's good. He slept through the night. 
 Oh, that's so good. That's really good. 
 And how is Amy doing? 
 Oh, she should be going home soon. 
 She was very lucky. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's face it... they both were, hmm? 
 Yeah. 
 Theresa, I don't want to frighten you, but I think you deserve to know. 
 There's been another attack. 
 Someone drove a truck through the fence. 
 Two died. 
 Where's Ethan? 
 Oh, no, he's fine. He's fine. 
 He... he was lucky, as well. 
 [sighs] 
 Theresa... 
 I know that Ethan has shared with you what's at stake here. 
 Mm-hmm? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Do you believe him? 
 I don't know what to believe anymore. 
 Good. That's good. 
 It's very important to question things, hmm? 
 Especially right now, when things are so... broken. 
 Why don't you go home, get some rest, hmm? 
 We'll take care of Ben. 
 Oh, and I wouldn't take Main Street for right now. 
 It's not safe. 
 Take Boxwood home instead, hmm? 
 See what you find. 
 Okay. 
 [elevator bell dings] 
 Ethan : Pilcher. 
 I need to find these people. 
 Easy enough. 
 Harold broke? 
 He gave me 14 names. 
 I'm gonna need some help track 'em down. 
 Of course. 
 Shouldn't be hard. 
 They're all together. 
 Where are they? 
 Biergarten. 
 [chuckles] Bring it up. 
 They're not there. 
 [dialing] 
 [ringing] 
 [telephone ringing] 
 Biergarten. 
 They took out their chips. 
 They're off the grid. 
 [ beep ] 
 Man :  Any available neurologist to E.R. 2. 
 Any neurologist to E.R. 2. Man : 302B? Woman : All right, hang on. Woman :  Dr. Roya, 6-8-7. Dr. Roya, 6-8-7. G.C.S. Her levels are dropping rapidly. Let me see that. Go ahead and intubate. All right, she's right at 9. [sobbing] [indistinct conversations] What happened? [monitor beeping] Amy? Amy! Ben, Ben, no, you can't come in here. But what happened? You can't come in here right now. She's had a swelling in her brain. What?! We have to perform a surgery. Ben, you cannot go in there. Please. No, she was in my... She was fine! I know. I know. She was lucid not long ago, but she's had an epidural hemorrhage, sweetheart, okay? We're doing everything we can. You've got to trust us, Ben. Please trust us. [sobs] [voice breaking] Oh, sweet boy. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Start by concentrating on the perimeter. We have to prioritize the fence. This is gonna take forever. Well, we've got over 5,000 cameras. Yeah, well, what if there's a blind spot? We're gonna find them. [computer beeps] Oh. [drawer opens, closes] [clattering] Megan : Ben. Has there been any more news? They won't know anything for a couple hours. Oh, Ben. Ben, you must take comfort in the fact that you are not alone in this. There's great strength in unity. It will carry us through any storm, no matter how fierce. [rhythmic clapping] [clapping continues] You told them? About Amy? Of course. They deserve to know. We're all in this together. Ben, have you thought any more about our conversation yesterday? [voice breaking] I-I don't know. Everyone wants to hear from you, Ben. They need to. This town, it's coming apart. I'm sure you heard. There was another attack last night. Yes, on the fence this time. But still there has been no reckoning. You remember... as the First Generation of this town, you are a leader now. Not me. And not your father. [clapping continues] Hey, you guys might want to take a look at this. [computer beeps] There's something going on at the hospital. Young Man : Ben! [indistinct talking] Where's Amy? Where is she? [crowd murmuring] Let him talk. Sound. Ben :  I know that you're all worried. I am, too. Amy's in surgery right now, and... they won't know anything for a couple more hours. But I-I saw you all, and I just wanted to say that... I'm glad you're all here. A-Amy's a good person. And... and what those people did to her was wrong. They broke the rules of our town, and those rules exist for a reason... 'cause without them,  we're all in danger. I just heard about another attack. [ crowd murmuring ] I just wanted to say that I-I'm sorry that all this happened. And I'm sorry that my dad failed this town. [sighs] Well, when is your dad gonna reckon them? He's right. Yeah. He's not going to. Why? 
 
 [crowd murmuring] [grunts] Ethan. Ethan! [tires squeal] [engine revs] [tires screech] [vehicle doors close] Aah! Franklin : Arlene? What's going on? Help! We're in here! Let us out! Let us out! Kate : What's going on? Arlene? [dialing] Keys. Give me the keys. Don't... don't... Arlene, don't look at them, okay? Look at me. They're not gonna help you, Arlene. They're on our side. We are just here to protect Wayward Pines, to protect our future. So please... give me the keys. [spits] [grunts] Come here! Arlene : No! [both grunting] Come here! Come here! No! No. You're making this harder than it has to be, Arlene. Please! Don't you dare touch them! Or what? Your Sheriff will throw us in a cell? Maybe give us a hug? I know what he won't do... reckon us. You're Jason, right? Jason Higgins. I know you. I-I remember you. You bought a toy soldier from us. Harold... he... he carved that. You must have been 8, 10 at the time. But I remember it so well. I remember because you were such a good kid. [bullets thudding] I don't know what lies they've told you since then, but what I can tell you is, what you're about to do, you will never recover from. You can stop this right now. It's not too late. Sean : She's right, Jason. We've made our point. This isn't about making a point, Sean. This is survival. Are you not paying attention in class? You deaf, dumb, what?! One crack in the ark, and it all goes down. [bullets thudding] It's our responsibility. [shotgun cocks] [door opens] All right. Out. Out! Come on! Get down on your knees! Don't look at me. [keys jingling] Come on. Out. Get out! Don't do this. Unh! Oh, God! Okay, now, you come on out. Don't even think about it. Aah! Ohh! What did I say? What did I say?! On your knees! On your knees. All right, everybody... after me. "Work hard." "Work hard"! Work hard. Work hard. "Be happy." Be happy. Be happy. "Be happy." Say it! Harold : Be happy. Be happy. "Enjoy your life in Wayward Pines." Enjoy your life in Wayward Pines. I love you. [high-pitched whistling] [distorted gunshot] [distorted gunshot] [sobbing] [gunshot] Ethan : Drop 'em! Down on the ground. Down! Arlene? [whimpering] Arlene? [door closes] [sighs] Kate. Kate. I need you to talk... ...or more people are gonna die. Do you understand that? [sighs] And not just your friends. Innocent people, Kate. Children. They don't think Amy's gonna make it. Mm. [sniffles] But nobody else has to die. [sighs] Here. Please, tell me where these people are. I'm not gonna kill them. You know that. But I can't promise you that somebody else won't. If I have them here in custody, then I can protect them. Just like you protected Harold? If you really want to protect them, you have to stop protecting me. I can't do that. You have to. There's more Jasons out there. They breed them in this town. They're not gonna just stop. And I c... [sniffles] I can't have anybody else die because of me. I'm done. You have to put an end to this. You have to do what Pilcher wants. There's no other way. If I did what Pilcher wants... you'd be dead already. Someone's gonna kill me. I'd rather it be you. [thud] I heard something. I think they're here again. Theresa. What are you doing here? There's something I have to show you. I think Kate should see this, too. [footsteps approaching] Where do these tunnels lead? I don't know. What's this? Theresa : You're not gonna believe this. It's Adam Hassler. [ static ] [ breathing heavily ] Adam? He was in on it. This is Adam Hassler. It's September 15, 14:20. [ breathing heavily ] Finally... finally reached the city. Oh, my God. Still no signs of any survivors. It's just Abbies. They've been tracking us. I think it's... I think it's the same group from before. Somehow they seem to be communicating with each other. I'm gonna try to... try to make it to the other side, join up with the others. Man : Hey, Hassler! Aah! [ static ] [mouse clicks] And Adam was just leading one group. There are hundreds of these video journals from cities all over the country, and... and there's nothing left. [sighs] Believe me now? Why? Why wouldn't he tell us? Because Pilcher's a control freak. We have to tell everybody the truth. They have to see this. How do you think we can do that without Pilcher finding out? Let me worry about Pilcher. You just think about getting people down here to see this, as many people as you can before midnight. Midnight? Why? What... what's happening at midnight? There's gonna be a reckoning. [computers beeping] [sighs] We did reduce the swelling. That's about all we can do for now. Just have to... wait and see. [telephone rings] Yeah? Uh, sir, it's Ethan. He'd like to see you. Where? Here. Ethan? I want to reckon Kate. Right decision. No. It's the  only  decision. When you kill a snake, you got to cut off its head. Kate's their leader. She brought this on herself. You know, this is your mess. I'll take care of Kate. But after tonight, no more. That's all I want... an end to the violence, a new beginning. Well, I'm gonna need everybody there. Everybody. [telephone rings] [telephones ringing] [cheers and applause] Yeah! Kill her! Is this what you want? Is this really what you want?! [indistinct shouting] Do it! I'm not gonna kill Kate. I'm not here to kill anyone. I'm here to tell you the truth 'cause we're running out of time. You've been lied to... about this place and about how you got here. And there's one man behind it all. You know him as Dr. Jenkins. [ crowd murmuring ] That's right... Dr. Jenkins. But his real name is David Pilcher. And he hides behind all those cameras. Victor : Sir? It's Ethan. He'd like to see you. Well, I'm gonna need everybody there. Everybody. He created this prison you live in. He watches everything you do. He tells you what job you can hold, who you can marry, and when someone has to die. He uses fear and violence to control you because he's afraid that if you know the truth that you'll self-destruct, you'll turn on each other. But can't you see? That's what's already happening. The world we knew is gone. It no longer exists. You don't have to like it, but you have to accept it. This town is all that's left. [crowd murmuring] He's telling the truth. The only reason I've been fighting is to find out what's out there. And now I know. I've seen it, and it's the last thing I wanted. I wanted everything we left to still be there, but it's not. He's not lying to you, and we can prove it. Woman : You are lying! She's not. He's telling the truth. I saw it, too. So have I. So have I. So have I. Man : So have I! Kate : David Pilcher... he doesn't believe we can handle this. But we're stronger than he thinks. Even with all these lies, with this violence, we have made lives here. How dare you say his name, Kate? How dare you? And this truth... it will only make us stronger. We can build a future here because we have to. Why are we listening to her? David Pilcher is a great man. David Pilcher is the savior of all humankind! He chose us, every one of us, and that is a great honor. We owe him our lives... our trust, and our devotion. We're gonna listen to her?! She tried to murder two innocent children! That is not true. She tried to destroy our fence, destroy our town. She is a terrorist, and she has to be reckoned. Enough. [crowd murmurs] What's the matter with everyone? Why are you all just standing there? [crowd gasping, murmuring] What happened to the power? [key clacks] [screeching]
