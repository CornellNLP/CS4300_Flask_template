 Previously on  Wayward Pines... 
 We should have a baby. 
 I found trauma possibly from the creature attack. 
 Possibly from something else. 
 I can't have children. 
 Are you sure? 
 (growling loudly) 
 They are surrounding us. 
 There are more of them every minute. 
 This experiment ends now. 
 (screeches) 
 (growls) 
 Hey, think about it! If you kill her, we all die! 
 Theo :  She could've escaped two minutes ago or two hours ago. 
 (gasps, growls) 
 (screeches) 
 (panting) 
 She dug from outside until she intersected the drainage pipe. 
 They're gonna kill us all.

 Woman :  Abigail's a very good girl. 
 An excellent girl. 
 Father's a senator. 
 Mother runs a charitable organization. 
 They'd like this handled quickly and quietly. She okay playing badminton? It's a very low impact sport. Best to keep up appearances for now. And she's not even three months. There. The blonde. And the father? All-American lacrosse player at Chamberlain last year. He's at Harvard now. And the child will come in December? Yes. Good. At the end of the year I'm planning a long trip. It'd be good for him to be settled by then. Timing is everything, isn't it? ♪ ♪ Kerry : It could be thousands or even more of them. What are they gathering for? It looks like Margaret. She might be back with the other females, but... You should see this. She might be dying. She's not their only female. And if she was the leader and she does die, then they'll just pick another one. Just like if we blow up their tunnels, they'll dig another one. If she is dying, it might buy us more time. How much more time, Kerry? Only one way out. Get CJ and Dr. Yedlin. Come on. She made her choice, pal. And I don't need another one of your lectures... Not why I'm here I'm past that. Congratulations. You can invite me to your, uh... anniversary party. Baby shower. Look, I don't know how much time we have left. It could be days. It could be hours. But whatever it is, I'm not gonna live it with that kid in charge. So what I need to know is where you stand. I don't matter. No you don't. (chuckles) At all. But I want this to go smoothly. You can help with that. But, I'm doing this with or without you. I won't be a problem. But I don't exactly understand the plan. They just got their leader back, right? There's a million of 'em out there, at least that's what everyone thinks. They can dig tunnels, they can make ladders. It's not a question of "if" anymore. It's a question of "when." So, I'll support you. Regime change? Yeah, I'm all for it. But what is the plan, Theo? Do you have some secret strategy? Some magic pill to cure the disease, (car door closes) to make all our problems go away? Or is this just about your tombstone and writing something different on it? Cj : Dr. Yedlin. He wants to see us in the Mountain. We have food for a month. We don't have medicine if people get sick. There are thousands of them right outside the fence. And now that they have their leader back, they can attack us at any moment. We could accept our fate. Tell the people of Wayward Pines. Give them a chance to get their affairs in order, cling to each other, say their good-byes. Await the inevitable. Or we can fight them. There's one advantage we still have. Pilcher. He believed. And he brought us all here in the first place because of that belief. Wrong amount of time. The right idea. The pods? We will return here to the Mountain, where we were all reborn. As quickly as possible. No. We'll go back to sleep. All of us. Pilcher :  For years,  we tried the old-fashioned way so many times. It's my fault, it was her fault... Who knows? Nowadays, of course, when nature fails, there are so many new methods. It makes you yearn for an earlier age. So here I am. Alone. You see, I want to leave a legacy. No, not of wealth or titles. A legacy of service and future leadership. A legacy of-of love. Unconditional love. For humanity. Hello, Abigail. You're older than I thought. (chuckles) How are you feeling? I mean... it's hard to get around and all, and my interview at Princeton's on hold. But I'm handling it. That's Animal Farm. Yeah. Senior year summer reading. They're making us. (grunts) Well, there's worse things you could be made to do. (chuckles softly) "Up there, comrades, up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that you can see, there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain. That happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labors." "The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again, but it was already impossible to say which was which." Well, yes, but it's actually quite idealistic. At the beginning. Did you finish it? Sometimes rules are good. Essential, even. It's... an allegory. So it doesn't mean anything. Maybe 20 years ago it did. Or 20 years from now, 20,000 years from now, but... This doesn't describe my world. Not yet. Well... it was good to meet you, Abigail. Thank you. For your time. Jason. That's what I call him. (grunting, shrieking) (phones ringing) Good morning. As leader of this town I've been many things. But I've strived to be one thing above all: honest. I've been honest to you about what this place is, where we are, who we are. And I'm gonna be honest with you now. Our enemy has moved close. In numbers we've never seen before. We don't know what they're planning. But we have to assume the worst. That an invasion is imminent. (crowd murmuring) And so we need to begin the immediate evacuation of Wayward Pines for your own protection. (crowd grows louder) Fortunately, there is a plan in place. Shortly after this meeting is over, we will begin the process of moving the residents of Wayward Pines back to the Mountain, where we will go back to sleep until the Abby threat is contained. It's safe, it's safe, it's all very safe. And it's the only way. For how long? 100 years? 100,000 years? (crowd murmurs in agreement) That is still being decided, ma'am. And then what happens? We should go the Mountain now! (crowd yells in agreement) No. There's over a thousand of you. We need an orderly system. So please go home and wait for instructions. We will come for you. (crowd continues murmuring) Cj : It took Pilcher and his scientists decades to perfect the process. But with the volcanic sand and the use of sulfur gas to kill the bacteria, it's all very safe. So you're dead when you're in it. Not dead. We turn you off so we can turn you back on again. And I'll be there to make sure you are safe. Your sister, everyone, every step of the way. I know it seems strange to some of you. You were born here. You've never known anything but Wayward Pines. But I've spent more time in and out of these pods than any of you. Even Pilcher. Asleep, awake, awake, asleep. And look at me. I'm not damaged at all, am I? (students laugh) Do you dream? Sometimes. (machines humming) (beeping) (trills) (trills) We have a problem. Cj : We ran a fuel test this morning. And? And we're ready to go. We even have a few empty pods, if you have any last-minute ideas. (chuckles) Ten days to spare. Thank you, Christopher. And have we decided on the exact positions... (phone ringing) Oh, excuse me. Hello. (woman speaking indistinctly over phone) Speaking. What do you mean? When? Of course. Woman (over phone) : We'll be in touch. Of course. I'm glad she's okay. Please give my best regards to Abigail and her parents. (phone beeps) So, should we move up the departure or stick with the current schedule? David? We still have a few days. He was the bridge. He was perfect. I'm Sorry All children are perfect only if we can teach them well. You can find another one. I'm running out of time. Jason : You're sure about this? The empty pods have to be charged. We tripled the voltage at the fence. We've been running the superstructure, this entire town off the core reactor. Nothing's been funneled here. So they're not charged at all? Some of them are. But some of them don't have the energy we'll need. We put people in them, into suspension, they won't survive. Why didn't you check this? We made an announcement... I started the tests as soon I could. How many do we have? How many pods are actually working? How many lives can I save? 571. (Abby grunts) Hi. We're ready. Excuse me? We're ready to go back to sleep. Go home. We'll come get you when it's time. That's okay, we'll... we'll wait here. (indistinct chatter) Dr. Yedlin. Trying to find in all these piles a shred of something that's gonna help. Let me ask you something, have you even thought about how long you want to put everyone to sleep, or are you just... spin the dial and see what happens? Dr. Yedlin, I need you to stop what you're doing, and I need you to do something else. (scoffs) I need basic medical assessments of the people in Wayward Pines. Physicals? Yes. Just review the files that you have. Of everyone in this town? Look for preexisting conditions. Maybe, um... a simple score, one to five, something like that? I'll need it in the next few hours. Do the best you can. We can't start the evacuation without it. You can't take everyone, can you? You want to know what kind of shape they're in so you can decide who you take and who you leave behind to die. Not all the pods are working. We won't be able to take everyone, we can only take... just over half. Only you and CJ know. I need to make selections. (scoffs) No. Has to be a lottery. It's the only fair and ethical choice. There are people who are essential, Doctor. Like you, for example. What if we did a lottery and you were left behind? Then I'd accept it. It harms the greater good. We'll take all the First Generation, of course, but we need people with valuable skills. Skills that we can use to rebuild civilization. You mean no troublemakers, no defectives. Yes. Well, if it's so simple, then you're not gonna need my help. I'm not saying this is fun, Dr. Yedlin. Are all the First Generation... are they valuable because they're young? Their-their youth? Or... do you judge them on their intellect, physical ability, their size? No troublemakers, no, sir. If you'd like to form a committee and submit a report in three months, be my guest. We'll all be dead by then. I guess in the meantime, I'll make the decisions myself. Defectives. Don't forget the defectives. And I suppose you mean by that the, uh, physically disabled, the mentally diminished. I guess in your calculus that's the easiest call to make. Of course... if someone is unwilling or unable to reproduce, certainly they're a defective. I mean, that's simple, right? That's black and white. You can... or you can't. Unless of course that defective is someone you love. You know Pilcher wouldn't take her. She can't fulfill her "grand obligation." He'd leave her here to die. But perhaps her death won't be so... painful. 
 
 Rebecca asked to see you. She's completed the inventory of the building supplies and has some rough projections about what might be out there when we wake up. Great. Everything okay? Any luck? Not yet. Kerry? There's a problem with the pods. We can only take roughly half the people. He's going to make the selections right now. I'll go talk to him. We should start the evacuation as planned. Then we'll just... stop at some point. Secure the entrance to the Mountain and that's that. You will just do whatever it takes, won't you? What good does telling anyone really do? Maybe they should know the truth. Truth? What good has truth done anyone here? It's life or death, Doctor. He's not taking defectives. He said that? Did he... I tried to tell him how valuable you were, but you know him. He just... doesn't listen, does he? He's giving you a death sentence. You can't sit still for that. I'm sure I can find a way... Take him out. I can't do that. I won't. (scoffs) Sad irony of Wayward Pines. You starve to death or you get eaten alive. He loves me. He loves Pilcher more. Rebecca :  There'll still be some  foundations left, to help us give the town some sort of a layout. But there'll be 100 other variables. For instance, climate change and the evolution of creatures. Are you all right, Jason? I'm sorry. Just got a lot on my mind. Of course. Getting everyone up here. Getting them all settled. A thousand people don't just move themselves. I heard that you're expecting. Yeah, that's right. That's wonderful, Rebecca. It really is the most important way one can contribute, isn't it? It's one of the ways. It's an important one, of course, but it's not the most important. Well, the rules say that everything... Enough with the rules, Jason. No one's pointing a gun to your head and forcing you to do anything. Sometimes you just have to do what your heart tells you to. You're right. You do. I'll finish this up and come back later. You should go home. For a little while. See him. Say good-bye. To the town. Thank you, Rebecca. Thank you for giving birth to all this. And for being such a productive member of Wayward Pines. Bye, Jason. (door closes) (babies crying) (nurse speaks indistinctly) The hospital appreciates your generous donation, Doctor. Obviously the needs of a public hospital are many, so we can discuss naming rights, but there's also certain shortages of basic equipment... Whatever you feel is best. But, Dr. Pilcher... I just need to get these papers signed. Or whatever's necessary to get this thing done tonight. Okay. I just know that some of the members of the board would like to... I don't have any time. I'm sorry, I'm... just on a bit of a tight schedule. I understand. It's just that his mother would like to meet you. I know, I know, I promise this won't take long, but she's young. She's giving up everything, Doctor. She'd just like to make sure that her son will be in good hands. (woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.) She's asleep. We'll come back later. No. No, I'm awake. Hello. Hi. I'm David. Kerry. Feeling all right? Yes. Well, you know. You probably thought I'd be younger. Don't worry, I'm... I'm just involved in the... I won't be his father. I-I won't be raising him. There's a couple in Texas. They're very excited. I didn't really have a thought on the matter. Which is surprising now that I think about it. Guess I was just focused on the whole, you know, "being pregnant and giving birth" thing. You're not from Boise, are you? Let me guess, Omaha? Missoula? I'll bet you own a bunch of car dealerships or something. I'm not from Boise. It's my first time here, in fact. Oh, you're lucky. I'm from Scotch Flats. About 30 miles away. Born and raised. It's a small town, you probably never heard of it. Just a dot on a map. If you run, they'll find you. I only know one small town around here. Lindseyville? They have the outlet mall. Different one. Oh. (chuckles softly) I-I hope you-you don't mind, but, uh... The father. I'm sorry. No, it's fine. I've known him since I was seven. But I-I didn't really... know him. He hurt you. No. He tried to hurt me. Like my stepbrother. Like my father. But I didn't let them. Don't worry. It wasn't either of them. This may be Idaho, but we're not that twisted. (chuckles) Well, don't dwell on the past, Kerry. Let's not even discuss it. The important thing is that you're strong. I can tell you're smart. "Street smart" they call it. I don't know if I'm strong. I know how to survive. I'm not sure that's the same thing. The strong do survive. But the meek shall inherit the earth. Well, I-I think that's still open to question. And now, about the money... We don't have to... No, no, no, no, no. It's im... it's important. Wh-What do you plan to spend it on? Hmm. Istanbul. The Grand Bazaar. Hearing the call to prayer at the Blue Mosque. Or Bolivia, the salt flats. Raindrops pulled back into the earth. (chuckles) But first, Paris. Oh, my God, have you been? I have. (exhales) I've been reading Proust. Do you know him? It's kind of totally boring, there's like 12 books, and he has to describe freaking everything, but when he gets it right... It was just the bite of a cookie that started it all. A Madeleine. Yes! I had to look up what that one was. But then the memories. They overwhelm him. From simply the bite of a Madeleine. Yes. I want to have memories like that. To replace the ones I have. First I need a life. Maybe you'll have one. Maybe even... a different one. Yeah, or maybe I'll never get out of Idaho at all. (chuckles) The past. You carry it with you wherever you go, no matter what you do. You can't run from it. You can't control it. I'll always be me. It's already been written. The book of life. Trust me. You can be a different person. Have a different life. I don't believe that. (breathing lightly) ♪ ♪ What? (door opens) Hi. You all right? No. I'm not all right. Our situation is difficult. But we have a way out. The Abbies are gathering, but we'll get everyone to the Mountain. We'll sleep. We'll all be safe. Jason, what is it? We won't be able to take everyone. I can only take half. We can't let them know. We have to get the ones that have been selected up here, to the Mountain as quickly as possible. Just tell me what you need. I'm glad that it's all out in the open. This isn't easy, you know. Every single person, the choice of who to leave behind... the fate that's in store for them... it's difficult. I love you. I love you, too. You're the person I can share everything with. There's no secrets between us... complete trust, right? Right. Always. That's why I'm wondering why you didn't tell me. Tell you what? You had a child. Dr. Yedlin said he wasn't sure that that's the reason... So it's true. The baby went to Texas. That was 2,000 years ago. Pilcher wanted me. He saw something in me, he  chose  me. What else haven't you told me? Nothing. What else have you lied about? Nothing! It's who we are here, now, that matters. How do you know the baby went to Texas? What? How do you know the baby went to Texas?! What are you talking about? Where is this coming from? How do you know?! Pilcher told me! Jason, what is happening? I am your partner in everything! Talk to me! (grunts) (grunting) (gunshot) Kerry :  The past. You carry it with you wherever you go. No matter what you do. You can't run from it. You can't control it. I'll always be me. It's already been written. The book of life. (carousel music playing) ♪ ♪ That's her. She's just the sort of strong partner I need. Jason (quietly) : It's very nice to meet you. I'm Jason Higgins. (exhales) (whispering): I'm Jason Higgins. Hi, I'm Jason Higgins. (sighs) Kerry. Kerry Campbell. I'm Jason Higgins. Hi. It's very nice to meet you. Where am I? There was an accident in Chicago. Chicago? Uh, I know... Uh, look... look, I-I apologize. I... I am, uh... (exhales) I know it's all very confusing. It'll all make sense soon, I prom... I'm sorry. (laughs) Wow. (laughs) Uh, I'm-I'm sorry. I don't usually do this part. It's just... you're so beautiful. I wanted to be the first face you saw when you woke up. Take it easy, okay? Ooh... You've been out for a while. How long? We'll get to that. There's time. We have all the time in the world. Tell me everything. I will, Kerry. I'll tell you everything. I'll teach you everything. It'll be fine now. You're safe. You'll always be safe. Trust me. (breathing shakily) Walcott Prep... ♪ ♪ .. they taught you well. ♪ Why does the sun ♪
