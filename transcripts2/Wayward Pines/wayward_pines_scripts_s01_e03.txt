 Previously on "Wayward Pines"... 
 You didn't make it too far, did you? 
 Oh! 
 Tell me again how you found that body in 604 first Avenue. 
 Why isn't it on the news? 
 Because it's classified. 
 What isn't classified when it comes to dad? 
 What if he's with that woman again? 
 I'm going to find him myself. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 Why don't the two of you come over for dinner tomorrow night? 
 That'd be great. We'd love that. 
 Nice house you got here. 
 I hope I never see this house again. 
 It's fear that keeps everyone in line. 
 Fear of what? 
 What happened to Bill Evans. 
 Who killed him? 
 Sheriff pope. 
 He cut his throat while the whole town watched. 
 I found a route that will conceal us till we get to the outskirts of town. 
 Well, before we do anything, we're gonna have to take out your microchip. 
 Harold's specialty is rocking horses. 
 Oh, my daughter has a rocking horse. 
 Oh. I didn't know you had a daughter. 
 Will you excuse me? 
 Promise me one thing. 
 If we don't make out of here, just promise me... 
 Hey, hey, hey, none of that. 
 [Telephones ringing] 
 They're gonna kill us! 
 Go get your daughter! I'll distract them. 
 Man : They've been spotted! I got a visual on her! 
 It is not just my job to keep this town safe! 
 It's everybody's! 
 [Screams] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Ethan : [Breathing heavily] 
 Citizens of Wayward, we are truly blessed. 
 Not every community is as fortunate as ours. 
 Man : That's right. 
 We truly care for one another. 
 We protect each other. 
 Yes. 
 Sometimes even... 
 From each other. 
 And we will not allow anything or anyone to endanger our way of life. 
 And I don't agree with the naysayers, those who say that being Sheriff is a thankless job. 
 It's trying sometimes. 
 But knowing that I've got the support and the trust of every single one of you gathered here tonight, that's what keeps me going. 
 [Animal howls] 
 Citizens of Wayward, will you join in with me? 
 Do not try to leave! Do not try to leave! 
 Where else is there for us to go? 
 Do not discuss the past! Do not discuss the past! 
 Savor the present. 
 Do not discuss your life before! Do not discuss your life before! 
 Let us accept each other for who we are today and not for who we once were. 
 Always answer the phone if it rings! Always answer the phone if it rings! 
 We all must do our part. 
 Work hard! 
 All : Be happy! 
 Enjoy your life in Wayward Pines! 
 Work hard! Be happy! 
 [Radio beeps] 
 Man : Code 83. No sign of Ethan Burke. 
 Work hard! Be happy! Enjoy your life in Wayward Pines! 
 Man #2 : Okay. Just make sure you cover all these areas. 
 We have to find him. 
 Work hard! Be happy! Enjoy your life in Wayward Pines! 
 [Smooches] 
 I'll make you a cup of tea with some milk. 
 That always helps. 
 Not here. 
 You know, I fell for you because you were fearless. 
 You were strong. 
 But what I saw tonight was just evil. 
 And I know you. You're not evil. 
 Are you, Kate? 
 [Sniffs] 
 Would you like a cup of tea? 
 No. I want you to come with me. 
 I'll tell them you were brainwashed. 
 Beverly Brown broke the rules. 
 What are you talking about? 
 She was just trying to get back to her daughter. 
 That's why she was reckoned. 
 What? 
 That's what it's called. Reckoning. 
 You call it whatever you want. It's murder. 
 You sat there with those people and you watched them cut her throat. 
 [Kettle whistling] 
 We didn't turn you in, but Pope said we did, as a warning, because we're supposed to police our neighbors. 
 But I... didn't stop it. 
 So I have blood on my hands. 
 Just let me tell you. 
 There are no second chances here, and you got one, so take it. 
 Hold on to your tracking chip or they'll know you took it out. 
 [Whistling stops] 
 It's been a long night. 
 We can make up the guest room for you. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 You gonna answer that? 
 They're not calling for me. 
 Last chance. Come with me. 
 You'll never make it out of here alive. 
 [Sighs] Watch me. 
 I'm gonna go find your daughter, tell her how much you loved her and how hard you fought to get back to her. 
 [Sighs] 
 Woman : Even young families are feeling the pull to smaller towns, preferring the atmosphere of an intimate community to the opportunity of a big city. 
 How did you sleep? 
 I was hoping that this would all be a dream. 
 Me too. 
 [Sighs] 
 We're actually, like [Scoffs] chasing... after dad. 
 [Sighs] 
 They didn't tell us anything before. 
 Do you really think that driving 500 miles is gonna change anything? 
 I need you to have a little faith in me, okay? 
 I think something is very wrong. 
 It's strange that your dad hasn't called, and you're just gonna have to trust me. 
 Or he's avoiding us. 
 [Sighs] Ben. 
 Whatever is going on between your father and I is between your father and I. 
 It has nothing to... 
 And Kate. 
 [Sighs] 
 Uh, look. 
 I don't want you to ever say her name again, okay? 
 Man : This was Beverly Brown's house, but we got a new family moving in today. 
 Hold on a sec. 
 Why don't you guys start... Uh, start upstairs instead? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Don't say a word. 
 woman : If you don't have an appointment, there's not much I can help you with, ma'am. 
 [Sighs] Okay. 
 Sweetie, will you go sit... Sit over there, please? 
 Okay. Look. I'm just gonna be very, very honest with you. 
 I have reason to believe that my husband, who is an agent in the Seattle office, is in the area. 
 Okay. 
 With another woman. 
 Oh. 
 Kate Hewson is an agent in this office, is that right? 
 You don't have to answer that. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 No, it's fine. 
 He's gonna be the one that's really sorry. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Got that right. 
 But I am just... I'm so confused because I don't know what to believe, my instinct or my... My husband's supervisor. 
 What did the supervisor say? 
 He said he began a formal inquiry. 
 With this office? 
 Yes. 
 Well, that's something I can check on. 
 Give me a moment. 
 Thank you. 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Snaps fingers] 
 Mom, what are you doing? 
 I'm putting some of that training to use. 
 Keep a look out, okay? 
 [Computer beeping] 
 How do you know dad's password? 
 It was your birthday. 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 Man : I can go ahead and double-check that. 
 Woman : Thanks. 
 Did you find anything? 
 Maybe. 
 Man : Just in case... 
 She's coming back. 
 [Computer beeps] 
 Woman #2 : I'll take care of it. 
 Your dad's last receipt was for a gas station in Lowman, Idaho. 
 Hassler : I think we have a problem, Mr. Pilcher. 
 Ethan Burke's wife might be coming to look for him. 
 You said you'd handle her. 
 She just logged into the system using Burke's user I.D., and I think she's headed your way. 
 [ Rock music playing] 
 Hey. 
 Hi. Do you work here most days? 
 Uh, yeah, except Saturday. 
 Uh, but if you needed me to be here on Saturday, I could be here on Saturday. 
 Hey, uh, this is my mom. 
 We're looking for my dad. 
 They're married, so... 
 Uh... 
 I-it's him. 
 He was in here last week. Have you seen him at all? 
 Yeah. Yeah, he was with another guy. 
 They were dressed like they were going to a funeral or something. 
 Okay, now, did you happen to overhear anything, like where they were going or... 
 No. 
 Boy : There was an accident. 
 I'm stoned a lot of the times. 
 An accident where? 
 Near Wayward Pines. 
 Wayward Pines? 
 Uh, it's a nothing town not too far from here. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 Good luck. 
 [Bell jingling] 
 [Siren chirps] 
 Am I getting pull... Was I speeding? 
 Ben : I don't think so. Grandma drives faster than you. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Animal howls] 
 Good afternoon, ma'am. 
 Hi, officer. Is there a problem? 
 I think I was going under the speed limit. 
 No, you're not the problem. 
 The problem is your vehicle. It's leaking oil. 
 Really? 
 Yes. 
 That is... I just had it checked last week. 
 Yeah, strange things happen. 
 Why don't you take a look for yourself? 
 Please stay in the car, young man. 
 If you look, you can see there's a substantial amount of oil. 
 Oh, gosh. 
 Now, I can tighten the valve so that you don't break down in the middle of nowhere. 
 It will only take a second. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Get back in the car, ma'am. 
 I need you to pop the hood for me. 
 Perfect. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 That should take care of your problems. 
 Enjoy yourself. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 [Sighs] 
 [beeping] 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Footsteps depart] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Door opens, air hisses] 
 [Vehicle approaches] 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Both grunting] 
 Where's my family? Where are they? 
 Aah! 
 Where are they? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Why are you so angry? I thought all you wanted was your family. 
 Oh, dizzy. 
 Where you going? Come on, boy. 
 [Chuckles] 
 There's nowhere to go. 
 I don't even know what they see in you. 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 Woman : Good afternoon, Mr. Burke. 
 We just wanted to let you know that your family was just discharged from the hospital. 
 Where are they? 
 [Receiver clicks] 
 [Sighs] 
 Where is my wife and son? 
 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 You just missed them. 
 Don't worry. I made them all better. 
 Where are they? 
 Well, I'm sure they're safe and sound at home. 
 And aren't you lucky that one of the best places in W.P. 
 Freed up last night, hmm? 
 Prior occupant had a sudden sore throat, if you know what I mean. 
 Oh, and I am speaking more as a poet than a nurse when I say that. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Ben : I'm telling you, there is no way that dad did all of this shopping by himself. 
 That would be a first. 
 Theresa. 
 Oh, Ethan. 
 Ben, come here. 
 [Sniffles] Are you okay? 
 Yeah, we're fine. 
 Let me look at you. 
 Are you guys okay? 
 I guess so. 
 What happened? 
 Were you in an accident? 
 That's what the hospital told us, but we don't... We don't remember. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Sighs] 
 What do you remember? 
 Driving. We were looking for you. 
 We got a... the car had, like, an oil leak or a spill or something, and then we woke up in the hospital. 
 And there was a realtor that picked us up at the hospital, that drove us here and said that this was where you were staying. 
 Well, I think that takes care of everything. 
 Mr. Burke, good to see you again. 
 I've gotten Theresa and Ben all situated. 
 
 
 
 Welcome home. 
 This house belonged to Beverly Brown. 
 Yes. But it's your house now. 
 And like all the houses in Wayward Pines, it comes equipped with a state-of-the-art security system. 
 Good luck. 
 Ben, I need a second with your mother. Could you step outside? 
 Theresa, this place isn't safe. 
 Can you tell me about anything that happened? 
 Anything at all your remember? 
 We were driving, and we stopped for gas. 
 And then we... the car started leaking oil. 
 The Sheriff pulled us over and told us. 
 The Sheriff? 
 Yes. 
 What Sheriff? 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 Don't answer any phone. [Sighs] 
 Hey, Benjamin Burke! Welcome to Wayward Pines! 
 Look. I have to go out for a second, okay? 
 But I need you to stay here in this house with Ben. 
 You've got to trust me on this. 
 Don't go outside. Don't talk to anybody. 
 You gonna trust me on this? 
 Can you trust me? 
 [Sighs] 
 Whoa, Ben, Ben, Ben. 
 What? 
 [Door closes] 
 I don't want you wandering around the neighborhood. 
 I want you to stay close to the house. 
 I think your mother would like that, too. 
 Okay. 
 W-where are you going? 
 Ethan : [Sighs] We just got here. 
 Ben, go inside the house and lock the door. 
 Take care of your mother. 
 Yeah. [Sighs] 
 That's what I've been doing. 
 [Door opens, slams] 
 [Sighs] 
 Nurse Pam : They are important. 
 It is the manner in which you choose to... 
 Mr. Burke, is there something I can do for you? 
 Stay away from my family, okay? 
 I've done nothing but help you and your family. 
 Is that why you brought them here? 
 Nurse Pam : Listen, Mr. Burke. 
 We just want you to have a happy life here in Wayward Pines. 
 You want me to have a happy life here? 
 Yeah. 
 Is that why you have a gigantic electrical fence surrounding the town? 
 Is that why you don't let people talk about the past? 
 Is that why you hold public executions? 
 And what about that place, the last place I saw you? 
 Come on. This isn't an ordinary town. You know that. 
 You are very right about that. This is no ordinary town. 
 This is an extraordinary town. 
 Pope : Mr. Burke, see, you have one of two choices. 
 You can either find your place and follow the rules, or you can keep searching to find what's behind door number three. 
 I guarantee you, you and your family will be much safer if you follow the rules. 
 Just stay away from my family or I'm gonna kill you. 
 This is my town. 
 All right, boys. 
 Let's not escalate. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Oh, of course. Absolutely. 
 Sheriff Pope, that will be all. 
 Who was that on the phone? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm talking to the wrong people. 
 You're not in charge here. 
 Can we go back to the hospital? 
 I want to check if they have my guitar and phone yet. 
 Mnh-mnh. Your dad told us to stay in the house. 
 And do what? 
 There's no Wi-Fi. There's no TV. 
 I know. But it's quiet, and that's nice. 
 Especially after the day we've had. 
 And the phones don't even make outgoing calls. 
 Okay, Ben. You need to give me a break, all right? 
 Your dad said to stay in the house, and we have to stay in the house. 
 For how long? 
 I don't know. 
 I could make up a number. 
 I mean, just think of it as a vacation. 
 It's exciting. 
 Or house arrest. 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 Dr. Jenkins : Ethan! 
 I heard your family is here. 
 How are they? 
 Ethan : They're fine. 
 Let me ask you a question. 
 Anything. 
 What is wrong with every person I've met in this town? 
 Well, I... I promise you, everyone is doing the best that they can, including you. 
 Ethan. Ethan! 
 Ethan, please. 
 I know you're trying to leave. 
 And I can understand that. 
 But you have your family here with you now, and... and not many of us here can say that. 
 We need someone like you here in Wayward, someone good. 
 Please. 
 Please, stay. 
 I can't stay. 
 Why? 
 Because I don't live here. 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 The woods are safe. 
 We can talk here. 
 Hey. Theresa and Ben are here. 
 What? 
 You didn't know? 
 No. 
 Have you told her that I'm here? 
 No. 
 I wouldn't wait too long. It's a small town. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Theresa : Ben. 
 Ben? 
 Ben. 
 Ben? 
 Pope : [Humming] 
 How did you get in here? 
 I knocked. 
 Door was open, so I kind of helped myself. 
 Hope you don't mind. 
 I'm a bit of a sucker for ice cream, and you guys got a brand-new flavor, which is like a rarity in Wayward Pines. 
 I made you out a bowl. You want some? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 Did your husband tell you that I was helping him with his case? 
 He's a real dedicated man. 
 I like him. 
 Is he home? 
 Yeah, he is. He's upstairs sleeping. 
 I hope we don't disturb him. 
 Okay. You got me. [Chuckles] 
 I came by to see you... 
 You know, see how you were holding up after the accident and all. 
 Do you remember what happened? 
 I saved you. 
 [Hums fanfare] 
 You know what? 
 I think Ben's gonna want some ice cream. 
 So I'm gonna just go get him, and... and, um, I'll be right back. 
 Don't I get a thank-you? 
 I'm sorry? 
 A thank-you. 
 For saving your life. 
 Normally, you save somebody's life, they say "thank you." 
 Come to think of it, your husband never thanked me, either. 
 And he's gotten a lot of special treatment in this town. 
 I've had it about up to here with my patience for the Burkes. 
 I think it's time for you to leave. 
 Okay. 
 It is your house. 
 As long... 
 As you and your husband remember... 
 ...this is my town. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 What about Evans? 
 I thought he was dead. 
 I didn't see him for a decade. 
 Then two years ago, I walk into the Excellent Bean. 
 Just a normal morning. 
 A-and there he is... At the counter. 
 He hadn't aged a day, Ethan. 
 I-I couldn't breathe. 
 It was like when I saw you... 
 A... a distant memory come to life. 
 I'm not a distant memory, Kate. 
 We were together five weeks ago in Seattle. 
 For you. 
 For me, it... it's a lot longer. 
 It's been 12 years. 
 And I work in a toy store. 
 That's impossible. 
 Don't try to figure it out. 
 I've tried running. I've tried everything. 
 The only way to stay alive here is to play along. 
 [Door opens] 
 Ben : Mom! Mom! 
 Ben, where have you been? 
 I followed dad. 
 I was right. 
 He's... he's with her. 
 What? 
 He's with Kate. 
 Tell me about this guy, Pilcher. 
 Ethan, I've done this... 
 Exactly what you're doing... For years. 
 I-I can't go down this road again. 
 The Kate that I know, the Kate from five weeks ago, she wouldn't just give up. 
 Not even after 12 years. 
 Hey. 
 When you're ready to stop hiding, then come see me. 
 [Sighs] 
 Theresa! 
 Ben : How far do you think the next town is? 
 Theresa : I don't know, sweetie. 
 Don't you think we should go back, rent a car? 
 Mom. 
 Do you think it's dad? 
 No, he doesn't have a car. 
 [Siren chirps] 
 Go. 
 Go, go! 
 Ben : Mom! 
 Theresa : Ben! 
 [Electricity buzzing] 
 Where you going? 
 How many times do I have to tell you? 
 This is my town! 
 You have to ask my permission in order to leave. - I know. I know. 
 I know. 
 Hey! What are you doing? 
 What the hell is wrong with this family? 
 Aah! Aah! 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Sit down! Shut up! 
 Please, don't hurt him. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Just please don't hurt him. 
 I just want you to sit there. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Get up. 
 Are you okay? 
 Aah! 
 [Grunts] 
 That was for his daddy. 
 You move one time, and I will blow his head off. 
 Come here, boy. Come here. 
 Why would you do that? You're on punishment. 
 Get in there. You get out, you die. 
 Can we talk now? Please? 
 Are you okay? 
 Yes, I... 
 [Gasps] 
 Ethan! 
 [Both grunting] 
 Get off me! 
 [Gun cocks] 
 I got you now, you son of a... unh! 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Door opens] 
 You think you want to know the truth, but you don't. 
 It's worse than anything you could even imagine. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Beep] 
 [Alarm blaring] 
 Let's go. 
 [Animal snarls] 
 Look! Something just took his body! 
 [Animals screeching] 
 Do you hear that? 
 [Beep] 
 Go! 
 [Electricity zapping, animals howling]
