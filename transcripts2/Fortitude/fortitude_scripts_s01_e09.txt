 Jules :  People are scared. Nothing like this has ever happened here before. This isn't Fortitude. 
 You called London. You told them I murdered Stoddart. 
 Eric :  What is he asking her, about Billy Pettigrew now? 
 Pettigrew's the reason he's here. Ask me any question you want. 
 Elena :  Whatever's happening to us, Shirley was a victim. 
 There's something else going on, something much worse. Frank :  Why'd you release the teacher? He's obviously connected. It's my turn to take the lesson. It's truth time. ♪ The river did come to me ♪

He'll require pain management for the frostbite damage, but... I can take him home? Medically, we've no objection, but the governor will make that decision. What your little boy did... God knows what she'll decide. A child murdered a stranger. A young woman attacked her own mother. The worst thing is that the killer's in your own home  watching television with you, eating with you,  lying beside you in bed at night, and could attack you for no reason. We keep the lid on Allerdyce. If nobody knows her condition, then nobody knows that Liam and Shirley carried out identical attacks. But we mustn't connect them in public. They are connected. They're the same. We cannot let fear take hold. I'll be back in precisely two hours. And then we'll begin. ( grunts ) ( chorus singing ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) Natalie :  Ovaries. pen1s. Male and female s*x organs developing in parallel. Do you think the spontaneous aborts are as a result of this hermaphroditism? Which is a result of some environmental factor? Maybe, though there is another theory. Which is? The Sami reindeer herders have accounts of similar mass events. It's whole herds that abort and miscarry. There's whole generations lost to hermaphroditism, and they say it happens when a demon lives amongst the herd, mates with them. What do they mean by demon? Well, there are other incidences in... ( knock on door ) Hi. Vincent : Hello. Come in. Hi. Was among the things we took from the professor's study. Your name. It might be important. Hi, Nat. Hey. We should go swimming soon. Now the thaw's here, I miss it. Yeah, me, too. You would be very welcome to join the two of us. Yeah. Okay. Bye. Bye. It's from Charlie. He's authorized research investigation  on a protected specimen,  ursus maritimus. He's left me a polar bear. A polar bear. Hey, lovely. ( panting ) ( kisses ) Liam. Hello, son. If there's no sign of necrotic debris... I see no need for further debridement. Frankly, his recovery is just...  it's remarkable. You're gonna be okay. I'm gonna take you home. Going to be disorientated for a while. If he complains of pain or if he's in distress... He won't be in any pain. We won't let that happen, will we, son? ( broadcast playing in foreign language ) Hello? ( broadcast playing music ) ( rifle clatters ) Whoa. You think murderers knock? Sorry. What do you want? Some ammunition. What kind? Hunting rifle. Caliber? 30-aught-six. Oh, old school. Yes, I'm something of a classicist. Very limited options in the 30-aught-six. What are you planning to shoot? Bear. I've got some 180-grain left. Mmm, I'm partial to 165-grain. No, don't stock it. Sold out? Long time ago. Who bought it? Maybe I can go beg a few rounds. ( chuckles ) Who bought it? You're asking me who bought the ammunition? Yeah, on the off chance that... Where I come from, we don't talk to policemen lightly. Northern Ireland? I'm from Fortitude. Right. Dan :  Under Norwegian law, they will not be prosecuted, but given the seriousness of the offense,  the authorities have ruled that psychological assessment take place. Frank :  We're the ones being assessed, aren't we, Jules and I? Hildur :  The whole family has to be assessed together to determine what caused Liam's behavior. I'll need your passports. Frank. Frank, come here now. ( sighs ) Okay. ( sighs ) It's magnificent. Killed another bear, full-grown adult male... ate it. ( air groans ) ( yelps ) ( laughs ) Sorry. I didn't think that would work. I was... ( winces ) Fucker. Taking a slice from the frontal cortex. The gyral pattern is normally formed. Normal cortico-medullary distinction. This sample will be number two. There's no evidence of discoloration or historical trauma, no generalized atrophy. ( beeping ) I want to know what's going to happen to Carrie if they can't find her father. Well... she doesn't have any other family in town, so I'm looking at other families that might take her in. No. I'll look after her. You'd do that? Yeah. She's 10, and she needs to be in her house. She needs to sleep in her own bed. She can't stay here alone, so I'll stay with her. I'll look after her. I think that'd be good. Me, too. ♪ Swift to its close ebbs ♪

Your old mom here told me you like the photographs I take. I was going to bring you one, but then I had a better idea. Now this little fellow here has great power. He's a  tupilaq. ( soft rattling ) Eh? Oh, my God. I think there's something very bad going on in this place. I'm going to leave here, and you should, too. Leave? Goodbye. Goodbye. Henry. I'll tell Liam about you. Thank you. - ( wind blows ) ( door closes ) ( stereo playing music ) Thank you. Oh, hello, Governor. No, no. Don't get up. Please. Your food will get cold. You know, the day I arrived in the taxi,  the driver said, "You see all that snow out there,  the icicles, the reindeer? Don't let that mislead you. This is not Christmas." ( chuckles ) Well...  maybe when all this is over, you can come back. When the glacier hotel is finished, you can spend a long, quiet night up on the glacier. Maybe. May I? Of course. ( cell phone buzzing ) Oh. Sorry. I have to... Professor Stoddart hired me to look at the effects of pollution and environmental toxins in apex predators. Polar bears? Yes. We're seeing aberrant behavior, cannibalism, psychotic behavior. What are you proposing? The tests I carried out on the bear, I want to do the same with Shirley Allerdyce. This bear attacked and devoured another adult male bear. We don't see that happen. It's psychotic. Now, Shirley Allerdyce... I know this sounds strange, but Shirley Allerdyce was an apex predator. What? Well, scientifically speaking, we all are. We're at the top of the food chain. And Shirley attacked and attempted to kill her mother. Biomagnification. The toxins accumulate in apex predators. Okay, a seal absorbs a gram of mercury, so the bear eats 100 seals. That's 100 grams of mercury accumulating in the bear's liver. So you want to examine Shirley's brain? Because if we find what we're looking for, then that means this place is dangerous. The environment. It's not safe to live here... for any animal. Carrie...  ( silverware clinks )  you want to help? Cool. Fork. Knife. Spoon. Dessert spoon. Now you. Fork on the left. Spoon, knife. What is it? Shirley stabbed her mom with a fork. Why did she do that? We don't know why. Nobody knows. I saw Shirley in the supermarket next to the fridge. She was... she was dead. And it frightened you? Yes. Okay, Carrie. It's okay. I'm going to make sure that you and me are safe, okay? I'm going to protect you. You understand? Okay. ( crying ) 
 
 What has he done? I just want him to come home. You're gonna tell me what happened the night Stoddart was murdered. You're gonna tell me how you got my son into his house and how you got my son's fingernail inside a dead man. How can you think... I never went near... Shirley Allerdyce attacked her own mother. That was you. You messed with that poor girl's mind,  and her breakdown was your doing. What Shirley and I had together was consensual... There's no point in you talking to me... and completely mutual. -  unless you're gonna tell me what it is I want to know. It's not anybody's place to tell me otherwi... I will not listen to bullshit. This comes off... when you're ready to tell me the truth. ( cell phone buzzes ) ( lock clatters ) ( panting ) ( card reader beeps ) ( door opens ) Never found the arm. Yeah, there wasn't much left of him, was there? Hungry bear. But you said he was screaming when you shot him, right? Mm, there was enough left of him for that. What is it you're looking for? Satisfying answers to outstanding questions. What questions? Well, it was minus-17 degrees with a wind chill of a further 10 degrees when Bill Pettigrew walked out of town. He was a trained geologist with years of field experience. I would like to know how he walked seven miles in his shirtsleeves and didn't freeze to death. I'd like to know why he didn't take his gun. And I'd like to know why the floorboards in his room are changed. ( chuckles ) You'll have to accept that... there's some things we'll never understand. You confessed to me that you shot him while he was being torn apart. Yes. With what caliber rifle? All police-issue rifles are the same caliber. Yes. I know. Okay, Hildy, once and for all, you're going to listen to me. You're not going to freeze me out any longer. I... Okay. "Okay"? Can I start? I loved you so much. You were so funny and smart and kind. You were the man I wanted most, and you wanted me, and... I couldn't be happier. But that man would never have done what you've done. And it's not that I can't forgive you. It's that you're not my man anymore. He's gone. ( crying ) I'll make a start. ( whirring ) ( sighs ) Come on. It's okay. ( wind blowing ) ( dogs barking ) Cancer is eating me alive from the inside out, so while I still have the strength, I'm going to get a grip of the end, make sure it's my ending. I came to this place, the purity was bracing, unsullied... stark and fierce. Now it's all got shat on, poisoned, and polluted. Fortitude is going down the toilet. I won't let that happen. You, Dan, I don't know about you anymore. I worry that you might be toxic. ( laughs ) f*ck you, Henry. What I did... I'm not saying it wasn't wrong. No. But I didn't do it for gain. I didn't do it for advantage. ( sighs ) I did it out of love. I never knew that, never knew love. - ( soft rattling ) What have you got there? Let's have a look. What is that? ( moans ) Frank, leave it. What the hell is it, Jules? Where'd it come from? He likes it. No. ( moans ) No. Let me see it. No. It's all right, sweetheart. Liam : No! Ah, sh1t! ( wailing ) sh1t. ( fluttering ) ( shushing ) What the f*ck is this thing, Jules? Where the f*ck did he get it?! I've changed my mind. I don't want you here. You think he killed Stoddart. You can't accept what he did, because you know it's your fault. Tavrani :  It's a receipt  for something he shot on the glacier that he wanted prepared. It's here somewhere. Did Pettigrew ever talk about why he was here? Might have done. Well, did he, or didn't he? I don't remember. Okay. This is what Pettigrew wanted stuffed? It's an arctic hare. It's a lovely animal. You know, they have a sense of humor. He was a geologist who came to Fortitude looking for something valuable... some treasure. Did he ever talk about it? Not that I remember. Henry been giving blood? I don't know what he does. He's sick. He's very sick. I don't interfere with him. When's he coming back? I'd like to talk to him. Berosofin. He's not coming back, is he? ( snowmobile roaring ) Henry. Hey! Hah! Ho! ( chuckles ) Henry? ( timer dings ) Hildur, the lab is expecting us. The mainland wants us to fail. Why would they? They can no longer afford to subsidize us. Lunatics clinging to a frozen rock. Stellan called. The drill engineers have pulled out. The construction team's canceled their contract, so they're not coming. You know, occasionally you have these moments of clarity. You think you're respected. You're barely tolerated. The glacier hotel, I'm told that their projections are not as optimistic as ours. I think the word "folly" was used. Is that what you think, too? You're our governor. You're not some... some salesperson for novelty hotels. This place is in danger. You're needed, truly needed. You're the one person everyone will turn to and everybody trusts. ( Markus gasps ) I know. I know how much you're suffering. Shut your f*cking mouth. We have the same question. Liam, Shirley... what made them do it? You. You made them do it. PFAs were present in Shirley Allerdyce, around 70 parts per million. Hildur :  You think that's what caused Shirley to attack her mother? We're seeing a pattern. Well, the beginnings of a pattern. These toxins are present in the brains of both the bear and Shirley. It's more than just a coincidence. So what's next? I propose we carry out another test. On what? On Liam Sutter. Dan :  What? You want to dissect his brain, liquidize it, and run tests on it? No, we look at his cerebrospinal fluid. A lumbar puncture would tell us if he's been affected. I know what you're doing... dehumanizing your victim. Please... help yourself, and tell me what you did. Nothing. I swear. I swear to God I didn't do anything. Natalie :  The procedure is painful. It's invasive and possibly unethical,  and I don't want us to be railroaded. By what? What? By confirmation bias. ( scoffs ) What's that? It's where you look for results to suit your theory, because your self-esteem has become more important than the scientific truth. Okay, we won't know until we do the procedure on the child. Thank you. Don't thank me. It's the truth. I was being ironic. ( chuckles ) But you mean sarcastic. Come on. That is... All right, enough! Everything I do from now on is breakage and loss, less of you left. Listen. ( groans ) Listen. You pulled my son's fingernail... ( grunts ) No. to leave as evidence... Wait. Like this. Wait! ( screams ) ( scream echoes ) Hildur :  I will speak to the boy's parents, and if they give consent,  you'll go ahead. ( groans ) ( drill whirring ) No. After you do this, there's no way back. Help yourself, and tell me the truth. Frank. Okay, listen, I'll tell the police. ( sobs ) You have something to tell? Yeah. Then tell me. ( drill whirs ) Tell me! Frank. Tell me! ( drill whirs ) ( sobbing ) Stop it. Tell me! ( groans ) Tell me! Stop it! Tell me! Frank! Oh, my God. If we don't get the truth, they'll take Liam. Turn it off. ( whirring stops ) ( panting ) Look at the state you've got yourself into. Look at the pair of you. All this blood and mess. All this pain. We don't want that, do we? This won't help Liam, will it? Hey. He needs you, Frank. He needs you to be strong. He needs to look up to his dad. And you are a good dad. You're a good man, Frank. You'd never hurt Liam, would you... never hurt anybody? ( whimpers ) Shh, shh. Let's go home. That's it. ( door opens and closes ) ( crying ) Dogs found this glove outside of town crusted with blood. Ronnie's? Look, I need to be sure. Minus-20 last night. We're only looking for a body now. Cartoon :  Yes, you. You already got your bear... Dan :  I should tell her. ( sighs ) No. Let me deal with it. You sure? Yeah. I will. Okay. Cartoon character :  Rain's over. Don't be so sure. The sky is still overcast. I bet it'll rain again. Wait. Look. ( stove beeps ) Pizza is ready. Elena :  Come on. It's just pizza. It's not gonna bite you.
