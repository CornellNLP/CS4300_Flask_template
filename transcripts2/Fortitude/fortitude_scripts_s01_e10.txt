 Well, it's the beginnings of a pattern. 
 And Shirley attacked and attempted to kill her mother. 
 Vincent :  We don't see that happen. 
 It's psychotic. We're only looking for a body now. Vincent :  The toxins accumulate in apex predators. Shirley Allerdyce was an apex predator. Frank! Oh, my God. If I don't get the truth, they'll take Liam. Who was there when Bill Pettigrew died? Come on, Henry. You'll have to accept  that there's some things we'll never understand. Morton :  When's he coming back? I'd like to talk to him. He's not coming back, is he? ♪ The river did come to me ♪ 
♪ Straight into my arms ♪ 
♪ I tried to caress it ♪ 
♪ But it ran through my fingers ♪ 
♪ Water will keep running ♪ 
♪ Rivers will turn ♪ 
♪ Water will keep running ♪ 
♪ Rivers will turn ♪ 
♪ Water will keep running ♪ 
♪ Rivers will turn ♪ 
♪ Water will keep running ♪ 
♪ Rivers will turn. ♪ ( Wind blowing ) ( Classical music playing over headphones ) ( Beeping ) ( Phone rings ) Elena! Elena :  What? Are you... Oh. ( Phone rings ) ( Piano notes playing ) ( Phone rings ) Midnight Sun Hotel. How can I help you? Yeah, hello. I'm trying to get hold of DCI Morton. Do you know where he is? He's out. If you see him, could you tell him... Tell him to call his office. Of course. Of course I will. Thank you. Bye. ( Knock on door ) ( Barks ) Shh, shh. ( Whimpers ) Would you like me to take you to the medical center? ( Whimpers ) Shh, shh, shh, shh. You called the police? Is that why you're here? No. I wanted to make sure you're okay. Not okay. I know that... Well, I'm not okay, Mrs. Sutter. I'm very far from okay. When someone behaves the way your husband did, though... ( Whimpering ) Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh... Consequences are inevitable. ( Door opens ) ( Door closes ) He's all right, isn't he? I don't know. I don't know. ( Engine grinding ) So tech department  have enhanced this GPR scan, and you won't believe what Pettigrew found. Those squiggly lines are bones,  animal remains, and tusks,  an elephant's graveyard of mammoth beasts,  a hoard of ivory underneath the ice worth a bloody fortune. So call me when you surface. They're here. Hildur :  Thank you for coming. Please have a seat. I want to talk to you about something that affects Liam very much. Liam? What I'm about to say is sensitive, so I need your word that you won't talk about this to anyone. Okay. It's been suggested that there are some kind of environmental toxins on this island, and it may be possible that Liam's been affected. Now, we want to see if there are any of these toxins in Liam's brain, and in order to do that, we need to take a little fluid from his spine. No, I'm sorry. I don't think he's ready for that, not now. As I understand it, it's not a complicated procedure. It's over in a couple of minutes. I know how difficult this must be. How? How would you know that, Governor? We need to understand what made Liam attack Professor Stoddart. Because it may still be affecting him. He may not be getting any better. If we found that a chemical had altered Liam's behavior, then that would change everything. It would mean that what happened wasn't Liam's fault. I am here to see Shirley. The medical center said she was here. Why was she moved? We needed to perform some tests. This place is for animals. I'm sorry. I need to see her. ( Gasping ) Der na. Min stakkars vakker. Postmortems are usually performed on the victim of a crime, not the perpetrator. These were exceptional circumstances. I can tell you now there was no violence in Shirley, none at all. What happens when you are finished? She's released to the family. There is only her mother. Then I don't know. No one seems to. ( Kisses ) ( Sighs ) What were you whispering about? Whispering? You and Dan were  earlier today. Yes. Um... What was it? Dan thinks... that we have to be prepared for the worst. What? Is it your father's? ( Sighs ) Yeah. I'm so sorry, Carrie. No. Just get off of me. Don't say that! He's not dead! He's not! My dad wouldn't leave me! He's coming home! ( Chorus singing ) ( Knocks ) Carrie. Carrie. Open the door, please. Carrie. ( Ronnie gasping ) Vincent :  Liam, this is gonna hurt a bit, okay? Won't be for long. ( Moans ) Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay. Good boy. ( Wails ) It's okay. ( Wails ) Breathe. ( Grunts ) - ( Liam groans ) Shh. ( Frank screams ) Hold still, sweetie. It's nearly over. ( Groaning ) Stay still. Just breathe. ( Whispers ) Keep still. Keep still. ( Groans ) Thanks. That's all. Nearly there. ( Sighs ) How's it look? They're negative. Absolutely no trace of PFAs in Liam's system. Shirley's levels are through the roof. Yep. Well, maybe it was her diet, maybe how long she's lived here. Maybe children process PFAs differently. I don't know. I don't know enough. ( Sighs ) We hurt a little boy. ( Sighs ) Well, this is something we've eliminated. We move on. We rerun the data Yep. I need some air. ( Fluttering ) Daddy's home. Hanna, don't drag your bag. Celia :  Jason. Jase? Where's daddy? He's... He's out. Go and get the rest of the stuff out the car, love. Jason! Baby. What happened? What do you think you're doing? That sound he made. Mr. Sutter. Sounded like an animal caught in a trap. I can't imagine being a dad and having to submit your own child to pain like that. I'm just not... What? I came here to do research for my PhD, not inject children and witness a murder and... Liam Sutter had an illness... and was seen by Dr. Allerdyce. Then Shirley attacked her mom. So what if the doctor is the link, there's a communicable infection, a contagion, and the doctor is the agent? Vincent, we've got their blood. Come and help me. Antibody profiles. Same antibodies, same infection. I'll catch up. Where did all this happen, Jason? Please tell me. Were you in a fight? Were you drinking? Jason... ( Voice fades ) ( Ronnie screaming ) Ronnie :  No! No! I'm gonna ring Ciaran, okay? ( Sighs ) Once I was you... a long time ago. You know, the worst part of being in prison, it wasn't... it wasn't just being in prison. The worst part was... waking up, like if I still was stabbing. And it was like it was alive. I couldn't control it. I would freeze...  and stay there for... hours. Because I would become aware,  you know, all the things that I lost... my family, my friends, my... myself. I wouldn't be the same anymore. Again... just because of one moment. You know, just because of a single moment. ( Freezer opens ) When my dad used to come home from training, he would have loads of bruises,  so my mom would give him some frozen peas. What were you talking about just then? My memories. ( Gasping ) We've established that both Liam's blood and Shirley's blood both contain the identical type E immunoglobin isotypes. This means they had a similar infection. What kind of infection? Type E is the body's first line of defense against invasive pathogens. Anything from tapeworms to... viruses. Are we looking at a virus here? Vincent : We don't know. But could a virus cause this psychotic behavior? I got thick skin. God damn it. Sorry. Have you been drinking? So, Natalie, how would something like this spread? Blood, saliva, sneeze, cough. So by now, everyone in Fortitude  could be infected. And slides and slides... Dan :  We're talking about the town doc. ( Doorbell rings ) Mom! The door! Her daughter sold everyone their food. I can't keep the island open. We have to contain any virus, infection, whatever the hell this is. You're suggesting we tell everyone there's a contagious disease here, but that they can't leave? 800 armed civilians and four police officers. All right, we announce a rabies quarantine. It's a normal procedure. We test everyone. You prepare the tests for everyone in town, and medical staff will carry them out, so nobody will panic. Oh, thank God. Where is he? Hey, darling. Well, there's no doctor on the island, Ciaran. What are we gonna do? 
 
 ( Chorus singing ) Jason? Jason! Ciaran : Jason! ( Overlapping chatter ) Let's go up into my office, shall we? No, I want to know the results of the test. Tell me. Nothing. They found nothing. Which is good news. I thought it was going to be good news if they found an environmental toxin inside him. Then he could be treated. I thought that was good news. Well, it's good that he hasn't been poisoned. So the chemicals, the toxins that they found inside the bear... Jules. they didn't find those inside my son? No, they didn't... So there's nothing... but you can't... to account for what he did. Just himself. He did it. So I have to accept that the only thing  that's inside him is some kind of evil. God. Jules. ( Music in foreign language playing over headphones ) ( Music stops ) When my stepfather was dying... I went into his room, and I... I asked him if there was anything that he needed. And he said, "Eugene, the only thing that matters now... is the quality of the light." I loved that. "The quality of the light." Dan didn't shoot Pettigrew. I know that. You did. But Dan did this. Handcuffed him. He was being torn apart  when you shot him. Tell me why. Tell me, Henry, or I have to take you back to London. f*ck! f*ck. God, I came here to die. This is totally unacceptable! What gives you the f*cking right?! Look what you made me do! ( Wheezing ) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come on. There's a good boy. W-What is it? This'll help. Morphine. No! No morphine! No! I don't want it! It must hurt like hell. ( Gasps, moans ) I'm truly, truly sorry. ( Yelling ) Liam's test results were negative. ( Freezer door thuds ) Hey, are you okay? Why don't you have a shower, go to bed? Got to look after yourself, or you're no use to anyone. Don't say that. Say what? Don't say I'm no use. Frank, I'm not saying that. I just mean you need... Listen to me, Jules. All war... all military training, everything I've done in my life boils down to one thing... protect, defend the family. And that's at the very, very heart of everything I am. Defend my family. Okay, Frank. Okay. ( Morton groaning ) Okay. What is...  what is that, a nine mil... nine millimeter? Yeah. I can survive. That's survivable. Nine millimeter. Okay. ( Winces ) ( Groans ) Okay. ( Groans ) It's just blood. Okay. I can survive it. I don't want you getting your hopes up, old son. Oh, God. ( Panting ) Henry... give me the morphine. ( Chuckles ) Give it... Here. ( Groans ) ( Sighs ) Liver cancer. f*ck. Feels like I've been shot in the f*cking guts. Why? Why? I don't deserve this. I can't help that. I'm not your judge. This is just a thing that happened. Like cancer. f*ck you. Oh, f*ck you. ( Spits ) f*ck... f*ck you, old man! f*ck you! You had no right. God damn it, you had no f*cking right! None! I came here to find a f*cking killer! To find justice. This... it's all wrong. There's no justice in this f*cking place. There's no... ( Groans ) ( Coughs ) I'm gonna make us some dinner. We sit together at the table, eat dinner. You at the head of the table, yeah? Okay. What am I gonna make? What am I gonna cook for you tonight? Would you pop out for me? I'll put the potatoes on if you get some steaks from the supermarket. Steaks? Yeah, or pork chops, whatever you fancy. Sure. Anything else? Ice cream? Ice cream. ( Chuckles ) Pork chops and ice cream. ( Door closes ) Liam, you need to help me, okay? Oh, wake up. Oh, wake up. Good boy. Good boy. ( Broadcast playing in foreign language ) ( Thumping ) Oh, excuse me. I want two tickets. ( Speaking foreign language ) Airport's closed. Rabies protocol. Governor called it an hour ago. No one in or out till the "all-clear". That plane's about to take off. It's only the pilot on board. Well, he's taking us. We're not a risk. Well, I'm afraid not, Mrs. Sutter. Please stop. Take Liam home. There is a rabies protocol. ( Grunts ) I have a weapon, Mrs. Sutter! Stop! I can't let him go, and you know why! Then shoot me. Go on! Go on! ( Screaming ) ( Crying ) Please go back to your homes! Henry :  Ski-Doo's out of gas. It's a one-way ticket, I'm afraid. ( Radio chatter ) ( Panting ) You can save me. Hey. Hey. Call them. Please? Call them now. Don't let me die here. Nils Anderssen was my great friend,  Dan's father. ( Chuckles ) The winter Dan was born, I stayed with them, Nils and Carol. She was a... Nils always said that the moment he first saw Carol, the universe cracked. ( Chuckles ) I loved her, too. God, I longed for and loved her so much. After young Dan was born,  I left, traveled, wandered the world. Nils became a cruel and violent man... Huh. He's yours. Dan is yours. I left him with a monster. I abandoned them both. Tell him. Tell him. Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. This is a mayday call. Fortitude Police. What's your situation? Henry, it's Dan. Where are you? What's going on? What's the situation? I'm on the glacier, Dan. I'm with Detective Chief Inspector Morton. I've shot him in the stomach, and he's going to die unless you come and get him. ( Static crackling ) Why the hell'd you shoot him, Henry? He knows everything,  all the proof he needs. That's the situation, Sheriff. ( Chattering ) Dan, are you okay? Huh? You okay? Yeah. Hey, Eric. Yeah? You'd make a good sheriff. Damn it. ( Gunshot ) ( Wind blowing )
