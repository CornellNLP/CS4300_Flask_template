Ah, their camp blew away in the night. Cheap tourist junk. Yeah, but Hawkeye here spotted 'em about a half a mile up over the glacier. Good work. Anybody hurt? Ah, they'll hurt when I bill 'em for the fuel. ( chuckles ) Great. Thanks. Henry. This is for Henry. Straight from the Governor's office. Henry Tyson's medical adjudication. So it's only a matter of weeks, then. Yes. So now the Governor has no choice. Okay, boss? I put your bowl on the floor, sweetie, in case you're sick again. He was up three times through the night, and now he's got a temperature. What is his temperature? I don't know. Was burning hot. So you haven't taken his temperature? No, but it's... he's burning up. Are you asleep, kiddo? You got your mum all wound up now. You hear me? Liam. You're not well, son. Liam. Then why don't you call the doctor if you're that concerned? ( woman speaking Norwegian over P.A. ) ( announcement continues ) ( announcement ends ) Vincent Rattrey? Professor Stoddart? Hello. Hello. Nice to meet you. Let me take that. Oh, thank you. And their research suggests industrial perfluoroalkyl compounds have begun to breach the blood-brain barrier in arctic predators. Cannibalism's a psychotic behavior. Bears devouring other bears, I mean, is the last resort for any species. Oh, just put it on the backseat. Just come out of the dark months, the winter dark. People are out and about again. Bears, too. Does it not really mess with your body clock, your mood and things? Do people suffer from depression? ( chuckles ) The opposite, elation. They say gleoi. Gleoi. Gleoi. Danish, Swedish, Norwegian,  Icelandic, Lap, we got 'em all here, and I'll guarantee you'll never know which is which. Friday evening, I'll make dinner, get Natalie around, too. I'll have finished my report by then. Lots to talk about, Vincent. Cannibalism's not the only aberrant behavior we're seeing. What's the report on, Professor? Environmental impact assessment for a tourist development. While you're here, these are yours for departmental use. You'll need your own rifle and a hat, something groovy with earflaps. And welcome to Fortitude. ( wind blowing ) ( television playing in Norwegian ) Hey. Read a review of this only last night. The man was saying it was the very best digital projector currently available. Bit like going to the pictures at home, eh? I thought Liam was coming over. Liam's sick today. Liam's not coming? You two fallen out? No. What's that you got? I found it. Found it where? Was Liam's dad in the army? Afghanistan. His last tour was February. So this is your first summer in the arctic. Yeah. Is it bad? Liam's got the mumps. Since he was sick last night,  Liam has not opened his eyes. Hasn't woken at all? No. Sleep is the healing strategy  that the body of a child employs. Liam's body is tackling a heavy viral infection. You know, even when a child is asleep, they can be fully aware of what's going on around them. What Liam needs from us is calm, someone with him at all times. Probably best if it's his mother. You and Frank planning on having any more children? Are we what? Has his dad had the mumps? Uh... he hasn't told me one way or the other. Well, ask him. Tell him to give me a call at the surgery if he hasn't. This could be a trunk. That's a tusk. So it has to be a mammoth. You think it's a prehistoric mammoth thawed out of the permafrost? Hey, we need to get out of here  before any bears show up. We could both use this, Jason. When that mine shuts, I have nothing, Jas, nothing lined up, nothing saved, nothing. Carrie's 10 now. She needs things. We could try and sell this to the Research Centre as a scientific specimen,  split it 50-50. What do you think? Let's get it on the truck. ( overlapping chatter ) Very impressive, Hildur. And now look. See? They wired it up with teeny-weeny lightbulbs. It really comes to life, doesn't it? It's time you and Henry sorted out your differences, Dan. By taking him his exile letter? Well, he can't die here. That's the law. Look, he's old. He's lonely. He's dying. You're his friend, so fix it. Margaret. Liam Sutter, 10 years old. Mm-hmm. What about him? He's got the mumps, 99% sure mumps, but... But what? it just might be something else. Yes? Why are you telling us this? Because his dad was in Afghanistan, and childhood poliomyelitis is rife out there. Incubation period, up to 37 weeks, so it is possible we're just seeing it now in Liam. Polio? It's a quarantine issue. You up for that, Governor? Seal off the town? It'll be your responsibility. Well, wouldn't we just isolate the Sutter child and quarantine the family? If he's been carrying polio for the past 37 weeks, I think it's way, way, way, way, way too late for that. I'll run some tests. ( scoffs ) Polio? I know. Sorry. All the glasses in the middle. Here. ( chuckles ) You're so gorgeous. So you're search and rescue. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. What do you do? You find helpless women? You swoop down and save them? ( both chuckle ) ( sighs ) Yeah, something like that. Maybe they're gonna need someone to save you from me. You think? Mm-hmm. You know... in this place... things can come at you from nowhere. Things? What kinds of things? Monsters. Monsters? Mm-hmm. You won't see them, you won't hear them... until they have you in their teeth. ( growls softly ) You know? And then they're gone... into the darkness... before you know it. ( bird squawking ) ( overlapping chatter ) Hi. You're Vincent Rattrey? Natalie Yelburton. So you're the guy that thinks PFAs could be responsible for these reindeer abnormalities I've been finding. You saw my paper. Skimmed it. So what's this experiment here for? This? Oh, this is dinner. Where did you get this? Out of its mouth. Its mouth? I found a carcass thawed out of the ground. You know, wiry, matted ginger hair, trunk. ( laughs ) Did somebody put you up to this? No. There's an entire carcass? I mean, its value to science is... is just incalculable. What's your name, please? Jason. So... put a precise number on incalculable for me, Professor. How do you mean? What's it worth? It's priceless. No, I mean what's it worth to you? How much would the Research Centre give me for it? No, you... no, you listen to me. The law about finds of this nature is perfectly clear. Okay. Hey. ( winces ) Hey! Hey, I know you! Your name's Jason! Jason! Dan : Are you still employed at the hotel? Woman : Yes. Has anyone in Fortitude spoken to you about the incident or given you reason to believe they may have learned about the incident? No. I'm required to ask you if you feel safe in Fortitude. Yes. I'm required to ask you if you have any plans to leave Fortitude. No. Because you know if you do, you must tell us. Otherwise, you would be in serious breach of your license and liable to recall. Mm-hmm. Are you seeing anybody? ( laughs ) Is that an official question? Officially... that would be none of anybody's business. ( chuckles ) Okay. ( clears throat ) Thank you. Hildur : I don't like you going out there without telling me. All I was doing was going up to the cabin to fix the storm shutters. Listen, you stood in a bear trap, for goodness sakes. You could have lost your leg. Okay, look, I'm sorry, Hildy. I'm sorry. So how is everything coming along? How's your speech? Do you need any good jokes for it? The ice drill's en route. Really? Mm. Left Oslo this morning, All happening. Storm shutters. ( chuckles ) What? You're lying to me, Eric. Hildur : "We live in the one place on Earth guaranteed a quiet life. Our honeymoon was a night of thrills and magic. Thrills and magic. Eric took me up onto the glacier in a tent... and now we're building a hideaway in the ice, a hotel hewn into the glacier itself,  where lovers of the wilderness, lovers of the northern lights, or just lovers... or just lovers..." ( no audible dialogue ) Good morning. How you doing? Fortitude Police. Now... I see you are not carrying any hunting rifles for protection from the polar bears. I understand. I understand, sir, where you're coming from. Good. But the waiting period for firearms put that precaution out of our reach. So that is that. I beg your pardon? That is that. See, we're only traveling inland. No bears. ( chuckles ) No bears inland? ( laughing ) No bears inland. What my friend means  is since, as we all know, polar bears are coastal predators and we're not traveling along the coast, then the recommended precautions were not applicable in our time scale. How are you? I'm good. What's he doing? He's Norwegian. Ah. Look at this. A polar bear will be eating you before you are dead. Once he has ahold of you, he is eating you. This is all the bear left of Billy Pettigrew once he was done with eating him. So you need to go back into town and equip yourselves properly before you continue. Oh, f*ck this. "f*ck this"? f*ck this! f*ck him. Hey! We have a gun. This would not stop me, never mind a bear. So you will walk back down the glacier into town. You will keep my rifle for protection. When you get back, you will bring my rifle to me, and I will return your handgun. Is that the cop you told me about? ( rotors whirring ) No. I put that one in the hospital. ( rotors whirring ) No. ( radio playing music ) ( sighs ) Do you mind if I make more steam? No. ( hissing ) It's late. ( sighs ) ( floor squeaks ) ( yelps ) ♪ There's a yellow rose in Texas... ♪ Pints? Thank you. For concussion. You taking the wine to the Professor's? Yep. Who's that? That's the Sheriff. Is he a good Sheriff or a bad Sheriff? Well, no one knows. Why not? In Fortitude, there's two fundamental rules. You have to have a roof over your head, and you have to be able to provide for yourself, so it follows. Everyone's got a job. No one's poor, so there's no stealing, and there's no crime. Everybody's always happy. There's nothing for him to do, then? So nobody knows whether he's a good Sheriff or a bad Sheriff. Henry? Drinking yourself to death? Join me. You want me to throw this lot out? No, leave 'em. Are we gonna talk, Henry? Billy Pettigrew was a geologist, it says. Yes. He was looking for something up on the glacier. That's right. No wife and no kids. Just like you and me, Dan. Yep. No mention anywhere at all of the bullet that killed him. Nobody found a bullet. That was down to you. The state he was in, they weren't looking for a bullet. I can keep myself topped up. I shake like a f*cking leaf. I was stone-cold sober that morning. It was a mercy you shot him. "A mercy." I shot him. Meant to hit the bear, but I shot him. Bang. ( chuckles ) Then the car door slams, and I think, "No engine, no siren." Car door slams, and there you are. You were there, weren't you? The Governor has advised that your prognosis is now final-stage palliative care. You can go back to the mainland, Henry. Tell me. You can die in peace in a hospice being cared for, not by yourself in this hovel. Forget what happened. He was as good as dead. Tell me. I can't tell you. Why don't you trust me? If Frank hadn't shown up for another couple of hours, I'd have nodded off. How long till you can walk? I can walk now. Means I don't have to sit through poor Hildur's presentation. ( chuckles ) Do you know a bloke called Jason? A coal miner? Yeah, I know him. Why? We had a fight. A fight? ( chuckles ) Well... more of a scuffle. He showed me a bit of something that he found. What? Animal remains. What kind of animal? Can I just say if he did find it on this island... Now you don't want to look like a gullible asshole. Can you arrest him? Find out if he's telling the truth? Because if he is, this thing needs protecting. Tell you what. When I get back, I'll pay him a visit, all right? ( men chattering ) So what do we do next? Jason : Let him stew for a while... mull it over. I'll go and see him again, tell him he's got 24 hours to make an offer... I'll go this time, f*ck with him. No, you won't, Ronnie. This thing needs calm and f*cking diplomacy. I mean, look at you. Mrs. Sutter : Liam hasn't opened his eyes. He isn't responding to my voice or his dad's. I think... I think we need to get him out of here. I think he's... I want him in a proper hospital where they know what to do. I think he's much sicker than that woman... Hey, hey. It's okay. No, I do. I think he is much sicker than that woman says. She's... I don't trust her, that Dr. Allerdyce. She's... Jules, listen to me. If Liam is not better by tomorrow morning, I will have him airlifted. Airlifted? If there is no improvement in Liam's condition by tomorrow morning, I will requisition a flight to the mainland. Really? Yes, of course. ( laughs ) Good. Now, I have to go. Have you met Elena? Elena? Hi. Hi. You must be Jules. Yeah, that's right, Jules Sutter. You're married to the search-and-rescue guy, the new guy. You know Frank? Well, I know who he is. How much does an ice drill cost? Oh, we'll recover the capital outlay soon enough, Charlie. You're putting all your eggs in one little basket. Well, I have no choice. You know that. The mines are mined out. There's no future apart from tourism, is there? Tourists, that's all the glacier really means to you, isn't it? It means businesses staying in business, Charlie, shops, bars, hotels, restaurants, hire firms, camping equipment. You won't win this argument by resorting to emotional blackmail. What argument? There isn't any argument. Where the hell is this coming from all of a sudden? You have reassured me at every stage of planning that it is a foregone conclusion that your report will permit the development of the Glacier Hotel project. I gave you no... I have committed funds. I gave you no cast-iron assurances. Public finances... Hildur... You promised me, Charlie! So... will the report give final approval for the Glacier Hotel project or not? What if something was found up there and we had to protect it? What? Something... th-that came out of the ice. What something? Charlie? ( crackling ) ( clicks tongue ) ( barks ) Come on. ( clicks tongue ) ( barks ) ( dog whimpers, barks ) Hey. ( sighs ) I spoke to Dan Anderssen. You spoke to Dan? You spoke to Dan? What about? He said if there's no improvement in Liam by the morning, he's gonna have him flown out to the mainland. You spoke to... why? Why would you do that? Why would you go behind my back? It's mumps, for Christ's sake. What if it's not?! You can watch him. Where you going? Jules. Wow. ( chuckles ) ( sighs ) You've never seen that before? No. I thought you studied polar bears. Well, apex predators, not polar bears. Oh, okay, grizzlies. No. Vincent, your paper was on biomagnifcation of perfluoroalkyls in apex predators. Yeah, in the U.K. In the U.K.? ( laughs ) What? Badgers? Yes, badgers. Badger can give you a pretty nasty bite, actually. ( laughs ) ( thump ) ( door opens, closes ) ( music playing ) ( overlapping chatter ) ( growling lyrics ) ( band playing distantly ) ( gasping ) ( band playing distantly ) ( band playing full audio ) ( band playing distantly ) ( door opens, closes ) Jules : Hi. Liam? You're awake. You feel better? Frank. Frank, come here. He's all better. Give me a cuddle. There we go. Ooh. ( sighs ) My little soldier. The swelling's gone down completely. Yeah. I'm hungry. ( laughs ) He's hungry. ( band playing ) All the time, I'm afraid to speak, in case I annoy you. I spend my life trying to think what it is you want... and I'm afraid I get it wrong. ( Liam yelling ) What, Liam? What's the matter? Are you all right? Liam, calm down. Liam, what is it? What is it, son? Liam? Liam? My feet are burning! Liam? ( screaming ) Sweetie, it's all right. Calm down. Get the car keys. ( screaming ) Jules, get the car keys! Charlie Stoddart said something's been found. He's not going to give us the go-ahead. What's he talking about? What's been found? He didn't say. Governor. Yeah, he didn't tell me. ( overlapping chatter ) You know the Governor. Of course. We would like you to meet Amanda Phelps of England. Third- and fourth-degree frostbite. We'll have to wait a few weeks. Wait? Wait for what? To see if debridement is necessary, amputation, perhaps. The doctor will explain. It is beyond me how you could let this happen to a little boy. What have you done? What? You're lying to me. Jules, I'm not lying. You left him on his own. You must have done. He must have gone looking for you. He must have gone outside because you weren't there. Please, Jules, not now. Please? Please what? What have you done? Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?! 
 
 ( wood clinking ) ( doorbell rings ) Hello? Professor Stoddart? Hello? Professor Stoddart? ( chorus vocalizing ) Hello? ( bangs on glass ) Hello! ( chorus ends ) ( panting ) ( snarling, barking ) ( dog whimpers ) Stay down there. Facedown. Facedown. I just... just got here. Cross your hands behind your back. Up. Please, I just... just found him in there. I didn't... Kneel down. Stay there. Hildur : I chose a life of crime in a town where there's none. I studied criminal law on the mainland, and married a policeman. ( door opens ) And we live on the one place on Earth we're guaranteed a quiet life. ( tires screech ) Our honeymoon was a night of thrills and magic. Eric took me up onto the glacier in a tent... or more a bivouac, really. And the temperature fell to minus-30, so that night, we saw the most spectacular aurora borealis I'd ever seen, the fireworks of the gods, as we call it, the heavens singing. You can actually hear them, you know, the northern lights outside the city. And now we are building a hideaway in the ice. We are building a hotel hewn into the glacier itself,  where lovers of the wilderness, lovers of the northern lights,  or just lovers  can witness ( cell phone buzzing ) the wildest things they'll ever see  from the safest place on Earth. I'm quite proud of that line, actually, so I don't mind if you want to use it in your brochures. ( laughter ) And here it is. Excavation's scheduled to begin in two weeks' time,  and in six months, we would be ready for our very first guests. So thank you, and enjoy. ( applause ) Sheriff Anderssen for you. Dan. Hildur. Charlie Stoddart's dead. What? I'm sounding the bear warning. Keep all the delegates in the building. Bear attack? Search the perimeter of the property, prints, spoor, or blood trail. If you see the bear, shoot to kill. ( dog barking ) What about him? Go. You stay in the back of the car  till the officers return. You think a bear did this? For your own safety. ( radio chatter ) ( panting ) ( vomits ) ( coughing, gagging ) Go as quick as you can, because... Yeah. ( barking ) Easy! Hey! Bear trails lead from the back of the house. Don't let the dogs inside. ( overlapping chatter ) ( band playing ) I'm dying of liver cancer. What?! I'm dying of liver cancer. Thank you. Out of here! Before you set off the alarms! ( band continues playing ) Yeah! Yeah! ( crowd laughing, cheering ) ( crying ) In the Research Centre,  we have equipment which could... could significantly improve Liam's chances of recovery. Equipment? Hyperbaric oxygen treatment can increase the viability of reversibly damaged cells by preventing hypoxia and reducing edema. Okay, if that's what he needs, yes. It's a research center. It isn't set up to treat patients. It's experimental, and... there are risks. Well, do you think it... ( cell phone buzzing )  you could get Liam in? We could make an exception. I'd need a signed consent. Hello. ( dogs barking ) Did you search the grounds for the bear? Yes, of course. You can't hear them coming, you know. Dan. Oh, my God. Look at the wound pattern, Margaret. This wasn't done by a bear. ( gasping ) Hildur. Oh, oh, my Christ, Dan. Hildur, listen to me. We have a very serious problem here. I don't think this was a bear attack. He's alive. He's still alive. ( monitor beeping ) Falling, dropping. He's falling to 42. He's arresting. Cardiac massage. Just put as much pressure there as you can, yes? Paddles! Paddles! Paddles! Charging. Clear. ( gasps ) ( car door closes ) Where's Charlie? What's going on, Dan? You shouldn't be here. What? There's nothing you can do here, Henry. Go home. Let me take care of this. Go home. Petra, what's happening? Professor Stoddart's been attacked and left for dead. At first, we thought it might have been a bear... What? but now it looks like murder, so full forensics, murder forensics, not bear forens... it's awful in there. ( wood clinking ) ( dog barking ) Hup. Go. Get in. Hey! ( dog barking ) Mr. Sutter! What now? What... what is going on? What are you doing out here? I'm looking. What the hell are you looking for? You're driving my dog nuts. Mm? What were you doing earlier this evening? What? Something wrong? Ah, you were doing something you shouldn't. ( cell phone buzzing ) ( coughs ) Yeah. Yeah, five minutes while I get my gear. ( dog barking ) Henry : Am I speaking to the same detective who was out here, D.S. Littlejohn, investigating the Pettigrew death? No. No, no, please, listen. Listen. Listen. Billy Pettigrew wasn't eaten by a bear. He was murdered. Now Professor Charlie Stoddart has been murdered as well. The Governor is responsible. Her Sheriff killed them both. Hey! Hey! Somebody! Hello! Natalie should have been there, too! He thinks she was invited to dinner, too. I know where she lives, and I'm on my way. Find her, and bring her in, Ingrid. Swabs, clipping, fingerprints. She's not a suspect, is she? Ingrid, it's important we can rule Natalie out. Okay, I'm on it. ( soft music playing ) Varsagod. There's a bear in town, Carrie. Where's your dad? He's at work. Bye, Shirley. Takk. Item? Sometimes a bear comes into town, and then the police have to carefully usher him out again. There are 3,000 of them and 713 of us, so I tell you if those bears ever get organized... ( laughter ) Excuse me. You'll...? Yeah. So, if you please gather around... Governor. I've just spoken to Dr. Allerdyce. It was too late to save him. Charlie Stoddart died on the operating table five minutes ago. Governor Odegard... Yes. I was hoping that we'd meet your husband before we left tomorrow. Is that going to be a possibility? Oh, no, I'm sorry. Eric's quite indisposed. Not too serious, I hope. Oh, no. He stood in a bear trap. ( beep, door opens ) What? The pulse. Yes? It's right here. Yes. When you found him, you felt for a pulse, didn't you? Yes. Here, on his throat. Hmm. And his wrist, here. Yes. You looked into the man's eyes face to face, like this. Yes. N-nothing. There was noth... nothing. He was dead when I found him, no pulse, no pupil response, was... he was dead. You're sure? Yes, I'm sure. Dr. Allerdyce : Okay, Jackie. ( monitor beeping ) Connected. Mom. Hey, kiddo. I'm here. You're gonna be all right. The doctor's looking after everything, okay? Mom, what is this? Where am I? Shh. Shh, shh. You stay down. Don't worry. Okay... Hold him down. Liam, this isn't going to hurt. It's gonna be all right. Move out of the way, please. ( air hissing ) ( beeping ) ( panting ) Natalie! It's me! It's Ingrid! ( wind blowing ) ( radio static ) Dan, Natalie isn't home. Her snowmobile is gone, and looks like she's packed clothes for a trip. She might have done a runner. Groups of four! Line up, and listen to Chief Anderssen. Fast as we can now. Come on! Fast as we can! Can we handle this? Are you? Do we have the resources, or should I request assistance from the mainland? I can handle this. You were drinking. Hildur, I was off duty. ( overlapping chatter ) If the murder team come over from the mainland, they'll be looking at you, Hildur, won't they? Charlie wouldn't give you the glacier. Anderssen : Our missing girl's name is Natalie Yelburton... 29 years old. You all have her picture. Many of you know her... Before you leave here, you must understand this. Natalie Yelburton could be a victim, missing, lost, abducted. Okay, let's go. Frank: Okay, come on. Let's go. Let's go! Move it out! ( overlapping chatter ) ( snowmobiles revving ) ( dogs barking distantly ) Man : Hello? Anybody? I'm looking for Chief Superintendant Dan Anderssen! I have brought back your f*cking rifle! Hello? Dan Anderssen? m*therf*cker. Jules : I just thought you should know they've got a treatment for frostbite at the Research Centre,  and I brought Liam here. ( sighs ) Just thought you should know. ( squeal ) Hello? Hello? ( soft groan ) Hello. Is... is everything okay? ( monitor beeping ) ( air pumping ) ( air rushing ) ( gasps ) ( grunts, groans ) ( groaning ) Woman : Traditionally, they used wee. Old ladies' urine. Oh, God. You've got to be kidding me. ( both laugh ) But nowadays it's fermented in ammonia. Well, that's progress. No, you have to wash the fish thoroughly in fresh water before you cook it, or you could burn your esophagus. I-I bet. ( chuckles ) So do you cook this...? Lutefisk. Lutefisk. Lutefisk... Lutefisk. for your husband? Once. Yeah. He wouldn't eat it. So what do you do? Wait. Let me guess. Travel industry. You know, the one thing that I don't understand about Fortitude is how the people there endure the dark months, I mean, the isolation, the cold, the desolation. the loneliness. ( chuckles ) It's never lonely. No? All the people who live there, most of them, share an understanding. What about? You look out for the wind chimes. Okey-dokey. Am I going to have a lawyer? You haven't been charged, only arrested, so you're not entitled to a lawyer unless or until you are charged. What if I need legal help? I can give you any legal advice you might require. I thought you said you were the governor. I'm also a trained lawyer and the Chief of Police on Fortitude. Well, you do have it all sewn up. ( phone ringing ) Sound? You need to record all of this. I know. Is it recording? I think it's recording. So why can't we hear what they're saying? I don't know. I'm not a f*cking computer expert. Hildur : Is that how you got that head wound there? Okay. Vincent : No. So we see it recording. I-I slipped... Now we can't hear what they're saying again. Ingrid, this is crucial evidence. It better be recording. Where's the manual? It is recording. Ingrid : I don't know. I think it might still be recording. We just cannot hear it out of these stupid speakers. Hope so. Red light. Red light. Red light. Anderssen : What do you think you and the Professor were going to talk about? About the work I was doing here at university and... Thank you. It's not him, is it? No. The boy was leaning on top of him. There wasn't a speck of Charlie's blood on him anywhere. But until we have somebody else in custody, I'm not letting him walk. It'll create panic, like we've lost control. I wasn't going to let him go. And what about the girl, Natalie? She's not at home. Her snowmobile's missing. Yep, gotta find her. Oh. ( both laugh ) How long? Jules : They can't say yet. They have to allow as much tissue to recover as possible before they can make any decisions. About amputation? Yeah. Where were you? Where did you go? Jules, listen. I know what you're thinking. I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to say. I don't know what happened. I think what happened is you went out to be with another woman. Is that right? Listen, Jules... Oh, my God, you were. please. Go. She can have you. Just go. Jul... ( radio playing music ) Hmm.

♪ It's all gone... ♪ Benny. ♪ I don't care. ♪ ( overlapping chatter ) Hildur : How did London get the news so quickly? Look, I have 100% confidence in the Fortitude police, but if London are kind enough to offer us this level of assistance and experience, then obviously... Every consideration. Yes. Thank you. ( seabirds calling ) ( ship horn blows ) ( ship horn blows ) ( tires crunching ice ) He's right there. Up here? Straight... yes. You need a hand? No, I'm good. Thank you. Right. ( groans ) Chief Superintendant Dan Anderssen, let me introduce Detective Chief Inspector Eugene Morton. Hi. Gene. Dan. Right. Here. I have a... this is a commission rogatory. It's a cross-border memorandum of understanding between Oslo and London. It formalizes my role as a representative for the interests of the family of the murder victim, so... Very good. Right. Ever since they opened the Research Centre, there's been this accord. Not with me. DCI Morton is a forensic expert. He can provide invaluable analytical skills, skills and experiences he acquired working with the FBI. Hmm. We have skills. I'm sure you do. And also with the International Aviation... Authorities Air Crash Investigation Unit. Investigation Unit, yeah. Right. We don't have an air crash. I've told DCI Morton that we will extend him every consideration. All right, if you'll excuse me. Yeah. Well, I have never felt cold like this. My ears actually hurt. ( chuckles ) And I've never seen a polar bear. I've never eaten lutefisk. What? Lutefisk. What about it? I've never eaten it. I've never tried it. But there's always a first time for everything. And you've never conducted a murder investigation. ( chuckles ) All right, I'll make a deal with you, Chief Superintendant Anderssen. If I'm right... I'll leave in a day or two, but if I'm wrong, I'll be on the next plane back to London, no questions asked, no recriminations. What are you talking about? Outside Professor Stoddart's house, I bet there are wind chimes. ( wood clinking ) You know, in the home counties, they have a similar signal, pampas grass in the garden. Means that swingers live there. That's not something we have in Fortitude. What, sexual infidelity? Pampas grass. How did the dog die? I shot it. Do you have another one of those suits I can use? No. Officer. DCI Morton. Hi. Hi. London Met. I'm here to assist with the investigation. Chief Anderssen wanted you take me down to the station straightaway. Really? Yeah. Chief Anderssen said that? Yeah. Yeah. He also said that you're the best officer to bring me up to speed. Shall we? Sure. Okay. Just straight down there. Great. You could not have been more helpful. Thank you. My pleasure, sir. Hi. I'm meeting Trish Stoddart in... She's in Dan's office. Yes, good. Thank you. Oh. So who are you, really, then? Let me introduce myself formerly, Trish. I'm Detective Inspector Morton of the Metropolitan Police. But you're an American. Yes. So can you tell me what the hell is going on? Well, I hope so. I mean, that's why I'm here, to find out what's going on and to look out for your best interests in the investigation. What investigation? Nobody's told you? Told what? I've been told to wait. Dan needed to speak to me. Okay. Well... your husband Charlie is dead. What? What? Somebody or something assaulted your husband in your home. At any rate, while they were searching the premises,  it turns out your husband was still alive, unbeknownst to them. He was left? Yes. yes. For how long? An hour. And as soon as they found out, they called an ambulance,  they got him to the hospital, but it was too late, and he died. Dan's here to talk to you about it now. I'm very sorry. I thought you knew. ( Trish sobbing ) I think we can rule out the grieving widow. I need a room. Um... Please, can you just get me a room? Ah, I've messed everything up. Yeah, I heard something happened to Liam. Is he being flown out? It's much worse than that. Liam's too sick to be moved. Oh. But look, just please... just give me a room. We can talk about this after. There are no rooms. ( sighs ) You can use my room. Hi. Starting without me? Who are you? DCI Morton. From London? Mm-hmm. 30 degrees softens up the dried blood just about right. You don't want to use too much pressure, because you want to make sure not to wash away any secondary contaminants. Are you okay taking notes? So you're here to help? That's right. From London? Mm-hmm. But he was only declared dead 12 hours ago. Mm-hmm. So... so how could you have got here from London to help with the postmortem  if you would have had to leave when he was still alive? "If you would have had to leave." Your English is very good. Okay, it's already apparent that more than one bladed implement was used in the attack. The striations here in the ribs and the sternum suggest a cleaver. These long incisions here are some sort of stabbing implement. And then these triangular punctures that are all over the torso, those suggest a third assailant and maybe, maybe that this is some kind of ritualistic murder. Ritualistic murder? What kind of a ritualistic murder would you say involves a potato peeler? Hmm? Get out of here. I can't do that. Shall I continue with the postmortem examination, boss? Please, Petra. Actually, let me take you through it from the very beginning. With this degree of injury, cardiac output would be impaired and blood flow to and from the brain severely compromised, and this would mean that the pulse at the victim's throat would be barely perceptible. Pupil dilation response was next to zero, and so he appeared dead. Hildy. ( sighs ) What's the matter? What, no one's told you? Told me what? Charlie Stoddart's been murdered. What? I saw him on the floor, and he was... he was all... he was completely split open. Come here. Oh, that's terrible. Jesus Christ. I know who did it. Where are your cigarettes? Right there. Where? Not in your jeans. Try my jacket. Hey, what the hell is this? That's mine. Driver : They got a man in custody,  but they are still looking. This professor had his head open. Imagine that. ( men murmuring ) Jason. Jason. Pick up, Jason. Christ's sakes, Jason, what have you done? Woman : You know that Jason is incapable of doing anything like that. Anderssen : Then I have to speak to him. You shoot to stop, just like you would a bear. I should have been there, but I was with you. Charlie : Trish, we might have found something incredible, something that's going to cause a hell of a lot of trouble. Is this what got him killed? He was already inside the house. Dan was already there? Yes.
