 She can have you, just go! 
 What is going on with you two? 
 It is my family life; It is none of your business. 
 If something bad happened... 
 It means police will make sure you and I are separated. 
 I will never let that happen to you. 
 Sutter was in Afghanistan. Terrible things happen there. 
 Terrible things happen here. 
 We found human blood all over Frank Sutter's t-shirt. 
 Get out! 
 Get out! Get out! 
 (Intro music) 
 Carrie : There it is again. 
 Ronnie : It's the glacier. It's on the move. 
 Glaciers carve out the valleys that create the mountains. 
 Shape the planet. 
 It can't be stopped. 
 Just keeps on coming. 
 Anybody tries to get in its way it just goes right through it. 
 Carrie : Like you dad. 
 Yes, just like me. 
 (Locks door) 
 (Clanging) ♪ (Bottles clinking) Henry : Holy Jesus Christ all mighty! What the hell are you doing in my house. Dan : I f*cked up. What happened? Frank Sutter. I arrested him. In the hotel. In the shower. (Laughs) On God! Punched his head off the wall. Why? We found blood on his clothes. Charlie's blood? Don't know. So why did you attack him? Oh f*ck. Elena. (Rubbing, sniffling) Shirley : Elena? You okay, Elena? Frank Sutter's been arrested? Yes. What for? I don't know they wouldn't tell me. In here? Yes. What was he doing in here? He was having a shower. They arrested him while he was in your shower? Mmm mmm. Naked? Yes! Of course! He was naked! He was in the shower! Of course! Okay, it's going to be okay. Are you alright? Hey. It's alright. It'll be alright. Please Shirley, please. Please believe me. You don't know anything. This is very bad. It is bad for Frank and bad for me too. Elena... what have you done? Hey... (Sobs) Doc Allerdyce : Is it tender there? Frank : A little bit. Doc Allerdyce : I am just going to look into your eyes... Stay there... Does he have to be handcuffed? I arrested him on suspicion of murder. He resisted arrest. The murder of Charlie Stoddart? And you punched him? That's right. Doc Allerdyce : How many times did you punch him? A number of times. Hard blows? Hard enough. Did he defend himself? What do you mean? Was he insensible when you punched him? Did his head rotate sharply? He hit his head against the wall. Also hard. When I punched him. Frank : You fucker... That fucker attacked me. Doc Allerdyce : You have to leave. Morton : He reacted! Odegard : He resisted! Morton : No, he reacted. He was naked. He was in the shower. Sheriff Anderssen barged in. He reacted. Odegard : Resisted. Morton : He was punched and shoved. Repeatedly. No formal caution was made. You can't be sure about this? Yes I can. I was there. I witnessed it. I saw the whole thing. This is a car crash. Odegard : Professor Stoddart was hacked apart. If Dan had justification for suspecting Frank Sutter did that then he had good reason to use overwhelming force in the arrest. Morton : Are you trying to persuade me, governor? Or are you rehearsing for a judge. Look. If your sheriff is anywhere near those interviews, all the interview evidence will be deemed inadmissible. You're a lawyer, you should know that. You want to conduct the interviews. Yes I do. Petra : To identify whose blood is on Frank's t-shirt we need to make a DNA comparison. Dan : I don't have time to send samples to the mainland. I don't have the equipment. Or the necessary skills. What about the biology department at the research institute. Stoddart's department? They would need tissue from prof Stoddart as well. An eyebrow follicle. That is usually what we send to the forensic lab on the mainland. Doesn't hurt when you yank it out of the head... Although, obviously... In this case... (Door closes) Trish : I made sandwiches for everyone. I had to do something. Eric : I know. You don't know. Who did you arrest? At the hotel? Frank Sutter. Search and rescue pilot. Why is he a suspect? Eric... Tell me. I found a garment. His. Covered in blood. Look. This must be just about impossible for you. Odegard : What are you doing? We need a DNA sample from Stoddart. Match the blood on the t-shirt to Stoddart and we have him. Good, I'll give that to Petra. No. Chain of evidence, Hildur. I took the sample; I'll give the sample... Dan. You have to stand aside. I'm not going to stand aside. Morton will do the interviews. You can't be present. You assaulted Frank Sutter. He killed Charlie... If he is the killer then he could go free because of you! Do you understand this! Vincent : There you go... I'm famished. Dig in. You not hungry? Natalie : I'm okay. Do you not like ribs? No I do. Totally... today they're just a bit too... Chest cavity. Vincent : I am sorry. Petra : Natalie? I need you to do a quantitative PCR on some fluid stains. Then a capillary electrophoresis. We would like you to cross check it with the DNA from an eyebrow follicle. Is this a blood swab? Yes. Whose blood? That is what we have to establish as fast as we can. The Professor's? I'm not allowed to say. The lab is not forensically accredited is it? No. Any results we give you wouldn't be admissible as evidence. I understand. We just need to know if there is a blood match. Five? Six hours tops. We'll have a result for you in five. Okay. Shirley : Red wine or white wine? Markus : That is the conundrum. Shirley : Exactly. Is it meat or fish? Markus : I decided that rosé would be a suitable compromise. Shirley : My mum's going to have kittens. She resolutely refuses to embrace any non-British grub. She does the whole expat marmite and baked beans thing. Well I think if you can swallow marmite then you can manage minke whale. Just don't tell her its whale, Markus. See if she likes it and then say. Okay. Want some stew, mum? Doc Allerdyce : Mmmm? Thank you. Oh, hello Markus. Markus : Doc... Markus brought a starter. So. Margaret. I hear you were brought in to check up on Frank Sutter. I'm not surprised they've arrested him. He's a violent man. I don't talk about my patients. Shirley is the one for gossip. You're wrong about that. Shirley doesn't gossip. She tells everyone what is happening in town. She doesn't exaggerate or embellish and everybody trusts her. I noticed this and I understood something. Something quite exceptional. In this town your daughter is the one person everybody loves. How's your whale, mum? ♪ Vincent : Taq polymerase. Natalie : This is going into the PCR for four hours. Can you prep the eyebrow follicle? We'll run it alongside. Yep. Petra : These do not look right, these reindeer fetuses. What is wrong with them? Hermaphroditism. Male and female s*x organs developing simultaneously. They're all spontaneous aborts. What is causing this? Well that is what we are working to find that out. Morton : Are you in any pain, Frank? Did you know Professor Charles Stoddart? No. You never met him? Never. Didn't know him, never met him. Didn't kill him. Can you tell me how your t-shirt got covered in blood? My little boy was sick. Doctor Allerdyce diagnosed mumps. Liam had been sick in bed for two days. Friday night I was at home with him all evening. Hm-mm. I went into his bedroom to check on him. He'd got out of bed and was lying on the floor. I picked him up and I noticed that the swelling round his throat had gone down and he was covered in blood. The swelling had ruptured. I carried him into the bathroom. He was dopey, half-awake. I put him in the shower, checked him all over. He started talking for the first time since he'd been ill. I gave him a wash and put him back to bed. The t-shirt I was wearing was covered in blood. It was ruined so I threw it in the bin. I didn't think about it it was just a t-shirt. Jules came home. Liam was seeming a lot better. She made macaroni cheese for the three of us. So the blood that was all over your t-shirt was your sons blood? Yes. So where did that blood come from? From lacerations, from cuts, from what? I told you, the swelling had ruptured. The swelling in his throat has ruptured? Yes. Yes. That is a lot of blood. What is your point? Well the point is that there was so much blood and then the bleeding ceased, just out of the blue. Which is unusual. He was hemorrhaging then is just stopped, then he was fine and then he ate macaroni and cheese. That is unusual. Why did you leave the army? I had done five years in Afghanistan. I missed my wife. Missed my son. So you brought them here. That's right. But now you and your wife are separated. And that is none of your business. Fair enough. Y'know I look at pictures of helicopter squadrons in the British army. And I see all these white, freckled, hooray Harry... Henry or whatever fella's... You know, British army officer class. But you know what I don't see? I don't see black faces. I don't see you. So it is very impressive that you achieved he status you did in the army. You have a glowing commendation from your superior officer. And then, out of the blue... You have a central retinal vein occlusion. And you go blind while you were flying. So you didn't choose to leave the army. You were discharged. Frank : Yes. That must have been very frustrating. All that achievement. All that hard work. All those years, just gone in the blink of an eye. No pun intended. It has never reoccurred. And doctors say with the medication I take it never will. Morton : But it wasn't on your medical records when you applied for search and rescue here. Was it? There is no connection between me leaving the army and Stoddart getting killed. None. Well, the DNA test will give us a result and either it will be your son's blood and you'll be released to pursue a wrongful arrest and assault charge against sheriff Andersson. Or it will be Stoddart's blood and you'll be charged with his murder. DNA doesn't lie. Does it. You're right. It never does. 
 
 Odegard : Hey. Eric : Hey. Did the search of the house give us anything? No. Nothing. Right, we need to bring in the wife. She is staying with her son all the time, he is very sick. What the hell am I going to tell her? Is Trish okay? No, Hildy. Trish is not okay. She's in pieces. Morton : Frank has said that he found Liam on the floor of his bedroom covered in blood. And that is why Frank's t-shirt was covered in blood. Did you not know that? Jules : No. Frank didn't tell you that your son had bled all over himself? No. Why do you think he didn't tell you that? Frank didn't say anything about any blood. We went... We took Liam to the hospital when he started to scream. Morton : Why was he screaming? Because he had frostbite. Frostbite? Where did he have frostbite? On his feet. On his feet? How did he get frostbite on his feet? He must have gone outside. How, where were you when he had gone outside? I'd left the house. I left him with Frank. Morton : What time was this? 7-ish... But Frank was at home with Liam? Uhm... Yes or no? Frank went out... Morton : You lied about that night. Friday night. Between seven o-clock and seven thirty. You went out. Left the house. (Door opens) You went and you met a woman. Who was the woman that you met. Frank, the woman that you met, who was she? Elena Ledesma. The woman that I met was Elena Ledesma. Morton : Where did you go and what did you do. Jules : Excuse me? Frank : We went to an empty building and we f*cked. (Howling wind) Carrie : Dad... dad... Dad... Ronnie : What? There's something outside... Right. Wait here. (Opens zipper) Carrie : Dad? Dad? (Tent flap opens) Ronnie : Hey. It's alright. It's just a reindeer. Chewing our guy ropes. Got a bigger fright than I did. Carrie, if there's reindeer around then that means there won't be any bears. Not for Miles and Miles and Miles. Means we're safe. Safe and snug and watched over by the reindeer. Come on. Come on and have a look. Come on. Come on. Come and have a look. There. You see? There is nothing there. Come on, get inside. Dan : You must have been young when you had Liam? Jules : I was seventeen and he was so sweet to me. He completely convinced me to marry him and have the baby. My mum didn't approve. So didn't... You said to me that you'd air-lift Liam if he didn't get better. Yes I did. That's the most kind and considerate thing anybody said to me since we got off the plane. You're a good man Dan. Excuse me Jules. Thank you for coming Elena. Governor Odegard and DCI Morton have some questions they want to ask you. Ingrid will show you to the interview room. I know where the interview room is. She's so beautiful. Morton : What did you do when you went to Frank's house that night? I... I threw a snowball at his window. Why? To make him come to the window so he would see me and follow me. And where did you want to lead him? A car repair workshop. Why did you take him there? Erm... That morning I met his wife. Where I work. And her little boy was ill. So I made a decision that I wouldn't be with Frank. So I wanted to talk to him and tell him that we were not going to be together again. So you told him that. Well, I wanted to tell him that. But it didn't work out. In what way? Morton : He told us that you had s*x. He's telling you the truth. Okay. But you said you went to see him to break up with him. But instead we had s*x. You changed your mind. Is your relationship with Dan Anderssen also sexual? Elena : No. No. I have no relationship with him. No. Morton : That's good. When sheriff Anderssen arrested Frank Sutter, he arrested him in your hotel room? Elena : Yes. He was in the shower. And you got between them? Elena : Yes. Morton : Why do you think they that violent confrontation, why do you think the sheriff was so violent? I don't know. I don't know what is in the sheriff's mind. Morton : Are you afraid to talk about this? Elena : No. Morton : Are you frightened to talk to me? No. Good, that's good. Excuse me. She says she doesn't have a relationship with sheriff Andersson. Eric : So she doesn't. Is there some other connection? Could you get me her file please? What file? The file that you have on her. It's in Dan's desk. Well could you get it. f*ck you. Morton : Eight years ago. Ricardo Scelsi. Stabbed through the right eye. Cause of death, scissors. Into the brain. Stabbed directly through the orbit of his right eye. Yes. Your fingerprints were on the scissors. As were the finger prints of your lover. Yes. But nobody knows which one of you killed Ricardo Scelsi. Nobody. You do. Nobody knows. Esmerelda is a beautiful name. I'm Elena now. You can change your name. You can change where you live. Go some place where no-one knows you, no-one recognizes you. But you can't change what you did. I wouldn't change it if I could. Markus : Shirley. There can't be any closer bond between two people than this. You are very beautiful. You are. I would never say such a thing casually. You are beautiful. And what I want us to do this together. This adventure. You changing, becoming ever more beautiful... This is not a fanciful, whimsical thing. It is a deep and powerful desire. It will bring us together completely. Now you have a start on most women. In my heart I see you as a special beauty. Truly. Okay. (Overhears chatting) You are beautiful. No more. Just one more. I'm sleepy. One more. Markus, please I've had enough. Okay. One more. Odegard : She killed a man. Spent seven years in prison for his murder. Dan : Read the thing. Joint enterprise. She and her lover. Killed a man. Who tried to kill her. She was harassed and abused and threatened by this man. And you kept this from me. She has a new identity. She has a new life here. It is proper procedure. In order to maintain... Dan. Dan. Please... You treated this woman's history as your personal secret. To protect her. To protect her! She's a convicted murderer and you keep this fact secret from me... from me! In order to protect her! Are you in a relationship with her? No. Don't lie to me, Dan. I'm not lying to you, Hildur. I don't have any sort of relationship with Elena. None at all. You know, when I was in prison, I met this man, a man who tried to help me. A psychiatrist. He said to me that everyone is made up of many... Atomos? Aatoms? You understand? Atoms. Atoms. Atoms, yes. So for a human being it takes seven years before every atom, one by one, is replaced with a new one. So that means that after seven years this person... Is no longer that. So you are saying that Elena is a completely different person than Esmerelda. That's what you mean. Everything is changed. That is how you console yourself. That you've changed. That you are different. You are not that person anymore. Somebody else did it. You didn't do it. I am not her. Not anymore. Morton : But you did you do it again. You found another stooge. Frank Sutter. And you and Frank Sutter killed Professor Stoddart? No. No. I did none of this. Billy Pettigrew. When I asked you the other day if he had stayed in the hotel. The day I met you, you blushed like you are doing right now. Billy Pettigrew. He was eaten by a polar bear. You knew him though. Eric : Why is he asking her this? Elena : I served him coffee like I served you coffee. Morton : Eugene Morton. See, if I say my name you don't blush. Why the f*ck is he asking her about Billy Pettigrew now? Because... Pettigrew is the reason he's here. Petra : It matches? Odegard : The blood on the t-shirt is Charlie Stoddart's blood. Natalie : That's beyond doubt. Odegard : Beyond doubt? Natalie : The DNA is the same. That's Charlie's blood. Right. How it got there or who killed him is absolutely separate. Vincent : All we can tell you is the simple fact. Nothing we've found can offer any kind of explanation. Thanks. It's him. Eric : Frank killed him. Ingrid : Why would he do that? Odegard : It must be to do with Elena. She's lying to protect him. They are one another's alibi. No. There's no motive. There is no reason. Morton : We are still trying to find a motive. Odegard : She says she was with Frank at the time of the murder. Now we know it is Charlie Stoddart's blood. Yes? That proves he murdered Charlie, therefore she's lying. No, she is not lying. No? If that's not the case what is the case, sheriff? Do you know something that we don't? Is there some kind of explanation here that only you can see? You know her criminal record. No, she didn't do this! Morton : You're besotted. They think you and Elena murdered Stoddart! They think you are infatuated with Elena. Enough to kill a man over her. Are you Frank? My son. Covered in blood! I thought he was going to die. That's what I thought so I panicked badly... But I didn't do it... I didn't kill Stoddart. I know you didn't. ♪ Vincent : The Professor told me this word. An Icelandic word for elation. Natalie : Glethi. Vincent : Glethi. That's it. It's sort of what I am feeling now. You and me. We could have helped catch the person who did this. Yeah. I want to get drunk or something. Yes. You should do that. I haven't got any drink at mine. Well, I have. Come to mine. Vincent : Okay. Jules : What are you looking for? I believe Frank. I believe Frank and Elena. I need to prove he didn't do this terrible thing. What was Liam wearing? When you left him. Just pyjamas. And do you know where they are? No. I couldn't find them. Think, Jules. I don't know. Under the bed? I would have found them there. Dan, talk to me, what is going on... In the little boy's bedroom. Covered in blood. Caked in dried blood. Frank was telling the truth. The frostbite. Something terrible happened to him. The little boy was there when Charlie Stoddart was murdered. He was right there. Frank : Dan? The window was open. Liam's bedroom window. Dan : Someone took him. (Grunting)
