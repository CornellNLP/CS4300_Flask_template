 Very impressive, Hildur. 
 And now look. 
 Trish : I listened to Charlie's message. 
 He says he's got something to show me. 
 Max :  Yuri Lubimov. 
 Who is he, and what does he do? 
 He's the head of security at the Russian mining town, Vukobejina. 
 I'll take care of him. 
 Got to bring 'em something we can sell. 
 What? 
 It's a surprise. Come on. 
 Carrie :  You've hurt your hand. 
 Ronnie :  No, I haven't. 
 Billy Pettigrew wasn't eaten by a bear. 
 He was murdered. The governor is responsible. 
 Her sheriff killed them both. A mercy killing. Except, I don't believe a f*cking word of it. ♪ The river did come to me ♪

( chuckles ) Eh... God. ( laughs ) You haven't a clue, have you? ( laughs ) And that is the beauty of it. A million quid, and you can't see it. ( laughing ) Your boys need putting on the ferry. Sort yourself out. ( overlapping chatter ) Eric :  Too many people not doing their f*cking jobs around here. At least he isn't working for his f*cking wife. ( laughs ) Eric :  What was that? I said at least he isn't working for his f*cking wife. Shut your mouth. ( overlapping chatter ) ( speaking Russian ) Idiot. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, what's your problem?! What's the matter with you, old man?! Get inside! Shut your f*cking mouth! Shut your mouth! Get back inside! What?! Hey! What do you think you're doing, eh? - ( bus leaving ) ( gags ) Ow! ( yells ) ( grunts ) ( sighs ) ( moaning ) ( coughs ) ( wood creaks ) ( overlapping chatter ) Can we drill right away? No. We have to put it together. It takes some time. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Thanks. Good work, everyone. Thank you so much. Really nice work. It'll take a few days to set it up, 'cause hydraulics need to settle. Then they'll be drilling by the weekend. Aren't you excited? Yes, yes, I am. Yeah. This week's been insane. You all did everything you could, and now we can look ahead at our glacier hotel, at our future. All set, Governor! ( speaking foreign language ) ( cheering ) ( man whistles ) Is DCI Morton in his room? He went out... early. Do you know where? ( water splashes ) Did he say anything to you? Elena, I need you to answer me. Last night, I saw Morton... and he was pulling up the carpet in his room. There's nothing there. He can't prove anything. I don't want your protection, Dan. I don't want anything from you. ( sighs ) Well, do it. You've never done this before, have you? Give it to me. I'll do it. ( grunts ) So now what? You drink my blood? No. This does. Whatever you say, Tavi. It must be near the boy when he sleeps, when the soul is unprotected. Like a dream catcher? No, not really. Listen, Henry...  they say that a  tupilaq  can come back to hurt the sender if what it's fighting is too strong. Not with this. ( chuckles ) ( dogs barking ) So you're ready to go? I had to sign papers. I won't be getting him back for weeks, it seems. I'll push them. I'd appreciate that. I'll do anything to help you. I just want to get out of this place. ( car door opens ) Goodbye, Hildur. I took his message off your phone. I thought Charlie was getting me into trouble with the glacier hotel. I'm sorry, Trish. ( trunk closes ) Is this supposed to make everything okay? He was my good friend. And me? You know, we all lost him. I'd really like you to know that before you go. Eric and I last f*cked two weeks ago. We've been involved since the Solstice Party. ( scoffs ) That's not true. Those weekends he pulled double shifts, he didn't. We were at your cabin. Charlie knew. You didn't. He's not happy. Oh, he'll never leave you, but he's not happy. He told me... so I know. ( car door closes ) You okay, Henry? A bit dizzy. You need to get your blood sugars up. Eh. ( speaks foreign language ) No, thanks. ( whistling ) ( labored breathing ) Hello, little bird. ( groans ) My throat hurts. ( clears throat ) You still haven't managed anything at all, hmm? Well... I've had an idea. It's gonna take all the effort out of it. ( sighs ) And this... means no dribbles. And this... special treat. Condensed milk. Delicious and nutritious. ( groans ) I'm sorry. I don't feel well enough. Let's give it a go. Hmm? Try a little bit. If it doesn't suit you, then we can try something else. Mm. Hey. You are a beautiful little bird... And you're gonna get more beautiful every day. ( coughing ) All right, there you go. Someone's had this. Checked it, darling. It's fine. You need to eat. It's calories, energy. Help warm you up. But someone's had it already. Well, all right. Here. You have that. I don't like cheese. Well, that's why I've given you the pie. Look, no one's eaten this bit here. No one's touched it. You need to eat something, Carrie. Please. I don't want it. Carrie, it's food, love. Get it down you. We're not far away now. Please. Go on. Go on. Get it down you. We're gonna meet Mr. Korsky at his boat. The one that didn't come last time? It was a misunderstanding. ( coughs ) What if he does it again? We have these now, the tusks. When you have money, people do what you want. ( coughing ) Where are you going? ( coughs ) No, I'm fine. Finish that pie for me, all right? I need a wee. ( coughing ) ( men speaking foreign language ) I'm only relaying what the mainland's saying. They want him there next week. They have special facilities. Margaret :  And they are not in a position to assess him. Only I am, and I don't think he's capable of going anywhere next week. Hildur, things happened last week that were unacceptable on a professional level, What? Like what? Sheriff Anderssen was out of control, and you covered for him. I treated Frank Sutter after Dan arrested him. Anywhere else but here, there would be an inquiry, and he would lose his job. Oh, so you want Dan to lose his job? For what? That up to the mainland to decide and not you and not those cozy circles that you foster in this town. f*ck you, Margaret. You know what? f*ck you  and your prissy f*cking bullshit. Margaret. Oops. Sorry, Doc. She pissed at you? I can throw her in a cell to cool off. I can't talk right now, Eric. I'm busy. I'll be leaving at 6:00 to get ready for the miners party tonight. Right. ( door closes ) ( sighs ) Woman :  Hello. Fortitude Police. Hello. Carrie? It's Ingrid. Do you remember me? We've been worried about you, sweetheart. My dad says we've got to leave now. I don't want to. I want to come home. Let me know where you're calling from. I don't know. What the f*ck? What the f*ck? What are you doing? Hello. Ronnie, it's Ingrid, Fortitude Police. Go wait by the skidoo. We know you didn't hurt Professor Stoddart. Your little girl wants to come home. You need to think clearly now. You need to make good decisions. I can. I do that. I make good decisions. Then bring Carrie back to Fortitude, and we will sort this out. I give you my word. You can't give me that... so we're going. You won't stop us. You won't take her away from me. Don't ever do that to me again. All right? 'Cause I do this for you. All of it's for you. ( speaking foreign language ) ( laughs ) ( grunts ) ( laughs ) ( speaks foreign language ) Talking. All we'll be doing is talking. What's the matter? Do you really think I'd bring the Fortitude cops here to back me up? This is between you and me. So let's begin with the evidence that you stole from my room. ( chuckles ) I said I just want to talk. ( chuckles ) You knew I'd come, didn't you? You'd thought about it. Yeah. I thought about it. ( clatters ) So f*ck you. I know who killed Billy Pettigrew. So we'll do a deal...  and I'll be keeping what is mine. Well, we'll see about that. 
 
 Henry. Dan. You like a drink? I'm looking for DCI Morton. He seems to have disappeared. Really? I want you to tell me where he is. How the f*ck would I know that? Because you brought him here. What are you talking about? You used that phone, and you called London. You told them I murdered Stoddart just as I murdered Pettigrew. I told you about my feelings for Elena. I trusted you with that the same day Morton brings her in for questioning, threatens to ruin her whole life  just to get at me. No, that's not right. I trusted you, Henry. I let you stay on this island so you could die well. I wanted to be there for you. So tell me. Where's Morton? All I did was make the call and nothing else. What the f*ck have I done? I... I don't know. You didn't actually see Eric Odegard put Billy Pettigrew into the police car? I didn't have to. He disappeared. The next day, they're pulling his carcass off that beach. See, what you're giving me here is circumstantial evidence. I think I will be taking that printout back with me. I found that on the beach where Pettigrew was killed. The bullet came from a .375 hunting rifle, Hmm, hmm? Do the ballistics on Eric Odegard's rifle. That's his slug I found on the beach. Why not another cop? Oh, they're all in it. They're all covering for Eric. Sheriff Anderssen, too? He carries around photos of Pettigrew's body parts. He tried to scare me with them. Why would he scare you? I said he tried. I've given you plenty. You can go now. Eric killed Pettigrew for that printout, okay, but that's mine now. And I get the Fortitude Police off your back if I nail Eric, right? Sounds like a deal. Sounds like paranoia. Aren't you curious... what this is about? What? What Pettigrew found beneath the ice? His buried treasure? I know what GPR data looks like. We use it to find stuff all the time. But you have no idea what's down there,  do you? All right, come on. Come on. Give us. That's it. Come on. Yeah, you'll be safe now. Here. Take that. You all right? Yeah? Okay, we're ready. Let's go. So I take the tusks. Yeah. They're onboard. I'll take them now. Get off the boat. If I ever see you again, I kill her. Okay, move. Okay, darling, we have to get off. What's happening? It's the wrong boat. Dad? All right. It's a mix-up. We'll get the right one in a minute. We're going home. Come on, Dad. We've gotta go home. ( flies buzzing ) ( cell phone ringing ) _ ( door closes ) Governor. I didn't know you were still here, Dan. You okay? Yes. I'm... I'm just... You'd tell me, wouldn't you, if people were saying things that made me look ridiculous? Eric. I'm talking about Eric. You don't need to go to this party. I can do it. Margaret :  How are you feeling? ( shallow breathing ) Markus said you managed to eat something. I'm glad you've got someone to care for you. I really am. But I care for you, too. You know that.

Why don't you go home, get some proper sleep? I've been told it's family only, just you and your wife. That's right. What should I say to the Spanish girl if she comes back? She said she was a friend of the family. She was here? Yes, last night. Liam was asleep. She just talked to him. ( sighs ) To be honest, we did feel sorry for you, me and Pettie, alone and in that cell all night. Well, should have come and paid me a visit, then. ( laughs ) Yeah. That would have been very unprofessional. Yeah. ( music playing ) To wrongful arrests. Hello. ( cheering ) ( laughs ) Uh... Governor Odegard wanted to say a few words, but she can't make it, so it's going to be me. Yeah. At least it'll be short. ( laughter ) We're here to say goodbye to mine seven  and some of the men who worked there. When people think of this place, they think of the... the ice, the bears, the mountains. That's what we want 'em to see. But you've spent your lives  working under the surface in the darkness. You did it the hard way, and I wish you were leaving in better times. What's happened during the past few days is... inexplicable. I...  I never thought something like that could happen here. We're... we're a few hundred people... Gripping onto a rock in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. We're alone. We need each other. ( cell phone buzzes ) And when we lose someone from the town, we feel it. That also makes us strong together. It'll take time for us to get over this, Summer's coming. There will be better days. Yeah. So... for those of you who are leaving us, ( speaks foreign language ) And for those of you who are staying on  to work on our new venture, you'd better wash off the coal dust.

( music playing inside ) I'm going to the mainland in the morning. I don't want to see you before I leave. Frank. Why did you go and see my son? Frank... What did you say to him? Not here, please. Why? Because you don't want all these people to know that this, this all started because of you, huh? ( music stops ) Huh? No, it's not because of us. Leave her alone, Frank. You're upset.
