 Picture the kind of love the rest of us can only dream of.     
 - MARJORIE: Has she met him yet? 
- Yeah.     
 A long time ago, but there's a break in the middle.     
 Hmm, a big one.     
 Is that why she looks so sad?     
 I think that's probably just her resting face.     
 And then this is her life line here, and today, that shows sexual arousal.     
 But the big news is that she meets the guy again, soon.     
 So, that's lovely for her.

- Yeah.     
 So until tomorrow, can we have a moratorium on personal questions?     
 Okay.     
 You know a moratorium?     
 Do you remember that phase you had at college where you thought that the word     
 - "hirsute..."

 - Yeah, all right. 
- And you went around baffling people,     
 "Hirsute, we should probably conclude, blah, blah..."     
 All right, yeah, yeah. 
What's a moratorium?     
 - It's a prohibition.

 No, that's not what it means, or no you...

 No, it sounds like you're talking about how amazing women's periods are, which is fitting considering that I've heard it's f*cking extraordinarily condescending about the female experience.     
 And I wouldn't mind if it was aimed at men, but your marketing goes to great lengths to emphasize this massive female following.
