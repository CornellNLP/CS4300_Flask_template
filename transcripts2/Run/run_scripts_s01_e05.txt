 This is the final call for the 0800  to Los Angeles. 
   Are you following me? 
   - Alice! 
  - Alice! 
   You're the very famous Billy Johnson. 
   Yeah. 
   I'm really glad that she doesn't know  about the real reason you texted her. 
   My love and I  made a pact that one day, one of us would text "run."  I can't wait to read the book. 
   I gave you a lot of money. 
   I'd quite like some more. 
   Give me that bag of cash, because... 
   Billy! 
   I was in your hotel last night,  and now that I've got Lawrence's number... 
   Fiona, Alice, she isn't following you, okay? 
   - She's following me. 
  - I gave Alice the money. 
   - Oh, you... 
  No! 
  - Billy! 
  We're on a train! 
   She literally can't have gone far. 
   - Fiona! 
  - f*ck you! 
   Billy: My love and I made a pact that one day,  one of us would text "run,"  and if the other person texted "run" back within 24 hours,  we would meet at Grand Central Station in New York,  get on a train,  and voom. 
   One week across America. 
   At the end of the line, we'd have to decide  to stay together  or never see each other again. 
   November 28th, 2005,  I texted her. 
  I heard nothing back. 
   January 12th, 2008, she texted me,  but I was busy, so  we've never actually done it. 
   I woke up this morning with a funny sort of a feeling. 
   I wondered, what if today is the day? 
   What if she would text back today? 
  So... 
   I am about to text her,  and if, miraculously, she texts back,  I'm gonna grab that bag and leave here,  and I'm gonna meet her on that platform. 
   And whatever happens next  will be the premise of the new book deal  you're about to offer me. 
   So, you ready? 
   R... U... N... 
   Yes! 
   Mm-hmm. 
   - We can't. 
  - We have to. 
   - No, we can't! 
  It's dangerous! 
  - Yes, we can! 
  Look at me! 
   -Oh, no, f*ck! 
  All right. 
  No, I don't want to! 
  -Come on! 
  Go! 
  Go! 
   Billy: Ruby! 
   Oh! 
  Yeah! 
   Baby! 
  That was awesome! 
   f*ck off. 
  f*ck, I'm broken. 
   - No! 
  Stand up. 
  - Oh, f*ck! 
  No, no, no. 
   - Shake it down. 
  - Right, yeah. 
  Okay. 
   - Okay. 
  Okay. 
  - Oh. 
  Oh no! 
   My coat's on that train. 
   I love that coat. 
   Oh, come on. 
   - There she is! 
  - Oh no, wait, Ruby! 
  Ruby! 
   Ruby. 
  Ruby. 
   - Ruby... 
  - Come on. 
   See? 
  She's an idiot. 
   - Let's get her. 
  - Yeah! 
   Okay. 
  Easy does it. 
   I loved that f*ckin' coat. 
   Ruby: We're comin' to get you! 
   Fiona: I'm gonna call your husband! 
   Ruby: That's our money! 
   You won't get away with it! 
   Wait, wait, wait. 
  Ruby. 
  She's... 
  she's saying she'll call your husband. 
   Ruby and Billy: No! 
   f*ck you! 
   - Billy: No! 
  - Ruby: No! 
   Fiona: Oh, why don't you just f*ck off? 
   Billy: Fiona, you total bitch! 
   - Ruby: Walk faster or she'll be gone. 
  - Billy: She won't be gone. 
   - f*ck. 
  She's gone. 
  - sh1t. 
   Ruby: How long have you been working together? 
   Billy: Nearly seven years. 
   She was only a temp at first,  but then she just kept on doin' stuff. 
   She was answering the phones,  making me tea when I didn't ask her. 
   Then she was doing the schedules, and pretty soon,  I couldn't scratch my arse without her help. 
   She sounds exceptional. 
   She was. 
  It was a f*ckin' nightmare. 
   Hey, um... 
   Have you slept with her? 
   What sort of a question is that? 
   - Of course I have. 
  - Oh. 
   We were working together for seven years. 
   Oh... 
   It would've been rude not to. 
   Mmm. 
   Billy: Where is she? 
   Hey! 
   Oh f*ck. 
   You think she went in there? 
   I hope not. 
   - Let's go. 
  - Yeah. 
   Ruby: Hello? 
   Oh, this is so f*cked up. 
   Hello? 
   I don't wanna... 
   Hello? 
   Someone's upstairs! 
  Did you hear that? 
   - No. 
  No! 
  - Someone's upstairs! 
   Over here! 
   Hello? 
   Fiona: Oh, why don't you f*ck off? 
   You shouldn't break into people's houses. 
   - I fell over. 
  - Fiona, just give me my money. 
   Jesus Christ. 
   I've got this. 
   Fiona. 
   Did you call Laurence? 
   When would I have the time to call your husband? 
   You know, I've barely had the chance to send him this. 
   Oh, come on! 
  Turn it off! 
   What the f*ck is that?! 
   - You're so dead! 
  Gimme that! 
  - Don't! 
   Oh... 
   Don't come one step closer, okay? 
   -Okay! 
  -Fucking traitor. 
  And you! 
   - If you're gonna put all your eggs in his... 
  - Billy: Look! 
   I am sorry about the meltdown with Jackie. 
   And I'm sorry about calling everybody c**ts. 
   And I know it's been sudden and we've lost money,  and that's all been hard on you, but Jesus Christ,  it's just money! 
  It isn't people! 
   You can't really care that much. 
   I mean,  maybe you're just in love with me, okay? 
   If that's the case. 
   Then I know that my being your boss  would have been hard on you, too. 
  And I get that. 
   Okay, give it a rest, Billy. 
   - What? 
  Don't you start! 
  - Just... 
  you know. 
   I'm sure she's good without the condescending speech,  Ruby: Jesus Christ. 
  And also,  money is important. 
  Maybe you don't know that  'cause you've never gone without it, you know? 
   Fiona, did you call Laurence? 
   Just gimme the money! 
   Fiona: I'm sorry... 
   - Ow! 
  - She cut your finger! 
   Hey! 
  Hey! 
   Ruby: I got it, I got it! 
   - Did he tell you about our plans? 
  - What plans? 
   - Shut the f*ck up. 
  - Fiona: Yeah. 
   It's not the only secret I've been keeping, now, is it, Ruby? 
   - What? 
  What? 
  - Nothing. 
  Just forget it. 
   Yeah, just forget about all those little people... 
   - wondering where you are. 
  - You know, I don't know what she's... 
   I know she's got f*cking kids, Fiona. 
   You knew? 
   I saw the picture on your phone. 
   - Why didn't you say anything? 
  - Why didn't you say anything? 
   That's why I couldn't sleep with you on the train. 
   Why? 
   'Cause you thought that I would have a flappy v*g1n*? 
   No! 
  No, it was just... 
  It was just the thought  of doing it with a mom, you know? 
   Of breaking up a family. 
  Of breaking up a family, I meant. 
   What the f*ck! 
   - No! 
  Not like... 
  - Fiona: Billy. 
  Billy! 
   People come to you for words,  and yet all that seems to flow out of your mouth is sh1t! 
   I... 
  I've been spinning your sh1t into gold  for the past seven years, and now... 
   you don't want it anymore. 
   Well, you can take my career away from me,  but you can't take this. 
   - No, what are you doing? 
  - No, no! 
   Billy: Get the bag, get the bag! 
   Fiona: Get off me! 
   - Billy: What are you doing? 
  - Fiona: Get off! 
   - Hello? 
  - Laurence: Ruby. 
   Uh, are you okay? 
   - Laurence: Where the f*ck are you? 
  - I'm, uh... 
   Billy: No, sh1t! 
  No! 
   Laurence: Ruby! 
  Are you listening? 
   I need to talk to you now! 
   Hey, Laurence, I'm gonna have to call you back in a few minutes. 
   Laurence: No, no, no, do not hang up on me! 
   Don't hang up on me, Ruby! 
   I swear to God! 
  You... 
   Where's Fiona? 
   Don't look out the window. 
   Why? 
   Billy... 
   I think she's dead. 
   She won't be. 
   - Oh... 
  - Oh. 
   Laurence? 
   Ruby, what is happening? 
   Laurence... 
   Baby, are you having an affair? 
   - What? 
  - Laurence: Just, are you... 
   Are you with him? 
  Billy? 
   Uh... 
   Uh... 
   Uh, wait, wait, what? 
   If you tell me that you are having an affair,  our marriage is over. 
  Are you? 
   Our marriage will be over! 
   Um... 
  ye... 
   No. 
   You are at a yoga retreat  in Malibu, right? 
   f*ck, just say yes. 
   Yes. 
   Laurence: Okay. 
  Good. 
   Um... 
   I miss you,  so I'm... 
  I'm gonna come and get you. 
  Just... 
   text me the address and I will see you there... 
   - 5:00 on Friday. 
  Okay? 
  - Oh, but, um... 
   Five o'clock. 
  I love you. 
   Yeah, you, too. 
   - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
   - We need to call an ambulance. 
  - No, no, no. 
   Yeah, we... 
  or her Nan  because her Nan shouldn't see this. 
   - Wait! 
  No, no. 
  - I'm gonna get her off the thing. 
   Yeah. 
  Or we get someone out here, you know. 
   -Where are we? 
  Where even are we? 
  -Wait. 
  I-I don't know... 
   -Do we have Wi-Fi here? 
  -No, no, wait! 
  Who would we call? 
   -People. 
  People to get her off the... 
  -No. 
   - Thing. 
  - Billy, Billy, um... 
 
 
 
   I need you to leave with me. 
   And we'll do the right thing, okay? 
   But I need you to go with me now. 
   Okay. 
   - Billy: I got sick. 
  - Yeah. 
   - You okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  I'm sorry. 
   Billy: I got sick over there. 
   Ruby: Hang on, hang on, hang on. 
   Wait! 
   Wait... 
   The money. 
   - I'll get it. 
  - Okay. 
   Billy: Which way? 
   Ruby: Do you see that? 
   - Is that a person? 
  - Billy: Who's that? 
   Ruby: Okay. 
  Um, just let me do the talking. 
   Ruby: Hello. 
   Ruby: Hi. 
   - Sorry, ma'am. 
  - Hello. 
   Hello. 
  Um... 
   Oh. 
   Are you busy? 
   No, I was just checking on this badger here. 
   - Do you think... 
  - Is the badger okay? 
   Well, no, I'd say she's completely dead. 
   Um, we-we need to get to a train station. 
   - How'd you get out here? 
  - Ruby: We hiked. 
   - Woman: You hiked? 
  Oh. 
  - Yeah. 
   And we got lost. 
   Um... 
   could you take us to the nearest station? 
   Oh, well, that'd be Trinidad Central. 
   Ruby: Could you take us there? 
   The station's that way... 
   and I was heading... 
   that way. 
  Are you okay? 
   I left my coat on the train. 
   It was a really great coat. 
   Ruby: Yeah, we need to get to LA really soon  because his mother... 
   has cancer. 
   - Why my mother? 
  - Yeah, I know, exactly. 
   Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 
   My mom had cancer, too. 
   Oh no. 
  I... 
   How long does she...? 
  Is it... 
  I... 
   Tell me something nice about her! 
   She used to put my toothbrush in the toilet  when I forgot to brush my teeth. 
   Woman: Uh... 
   Is that nice? 
   - You put this on. 
  - Thanks. 
   You help me get this badger in the van,  I'll give you guys a ride. 
   - Are you from here? 
  - No. 
   Uh, no, I've been here about six years,  but I came here for the animals. 
   Which animals? 
   - Oh, just the dead ones. 
  - Billy: Dead ones? 
   Beavers, yeah, dead beavers, dead prairie dogs. 
   Just anything dead, really. 
   There's a lot of roadkill around here. 
   No one touches it. 
  It's such a waste. 
   People don't really know what to do when they see a dead thing. 
   I've just always felt very comfortable with them. 
   Once they're stuffed, they all but come back to life. 
   - Are you a taxidermist? 
  - Yeah, that's me. 
   Oh... 
  Oh, thank God. 
   - Ruby: Thank you so much. 
  - Woman: Of course. 
   He can keep the coat. 
   - Oh. 
  - Ruby: Oh God, I'm so sorry. 
   - Oh, no! 
  - Billy. 
  Billy! 
   Billy! 
   - Thank you. 
  - Sorry. 
   Can we... 
   - give you some money? 
  - Oh no, no. 
   Tell him to keep talkin' about her. 
   - Who? 
  - His mom. 
   It's what helped me. 
   Ruby. 
   Ruby: One second. 
   Ruby. 
   Have we made it? 
   Yeah. 
   The train's coming in 20 minutes. 
   Do you get the feelin' like we're walking away  from something... 
   that we can never walk away from? 
   No. 
   Do you feel like you've surprised yourself  with how you've reacted to this? 
   Yeah. 
   Have I surprised you? 
   I'm glad you're here with me. 
   Ruby: I need the bathroom. 
   Ruby: f*ck. 
   Oh God! 
   Ruby: Oh. 
  No! 
  Oh my God! 
   Oh my God! 
   f*ck! 
   Oh my God! 
  f*ck! 
   What's wrong? 
   Hey. 
  It's all right. 
   This is it, this is just a moment. 
   Okay? 
  It'll pass. 
  This won't be all our moments. 
   It's okay, it'll pass. 
   I can't find my phone! 
   That's okay. 
  That's all right. 
   Where's the last place that you remember having it? 
   Did you have it in the van? 
   f*ck! 
  f*ck! 
   - f*ck! 
  - Okay! 
  Okay, listen. 
  It's okay. 
   It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. 
  Listen to me. 
  Listen to me. 
   We have to go back for it. 
   - What?! 
  f*ck! 
  - Yeah... 
   - I know, I know, but that's okay. 
  - f*ck! 
  f*ck! 
   f*ck! 
   Ah! 
  Fu... 
   I think we should call the police. 
   I'm actually, very happy to talk to the police, thanks. 
   Someone should visit the woman who reported this. 
   I'm uh, instigating a, uh, possible murder case. 
   You wanna come in? 
   Did you see anyone? 
   A meaty blonde, and a guy in a women's coat. 
   And I'm the violent one? 
   Run. 
   Don't say that unless you mean it.
