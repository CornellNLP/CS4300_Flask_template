 Ruby! 
   Yeah! 
   - Come on! 
  - Let's get her. 
   You think she went in there? 
   - I hope not. 
  - Let's go. 
   Hello? 
   They could take my career away from me. 
   - Fiona, just give me my money. 
  - You can't take this. 
   - No, what are you doing? 
  - No, no! 
   Get the bag, get the bag. 
   - Oh. 
  - Oh. 
   - Laurence. 
  - Ruby, what is happening? 
   - Uh... 
  - Are you with him? 
  Billy? 
   Um... 
  no. 
   You are at a yoga retreat in Malibu, right? 
   Yes. 
   I'm gonna come and get you. 
   I need you to go with me now. 
   Could you take us to the nearest station? 
   Hello. 
  If you put this on... 
   - Thanks. 
  - ...I'll give you guys a ride. 
   Oh, my God. 
  I can't find my phone! 
   We have to go back for it. 
   Was that light on before? 
   Yeah... 
   Okay. 
   Okay. 
   - You don't have to come with me... 
  - Thanks. 
   - For f*ck's sake. 
  - Good luck! 
   Oh sh1t! 
   - Did you get it? 
  - Aaah! 
   - Sorry! 
  - For f*ck's sake! 
   - Why would you do that! 
  - Shh, shh! 
   - Did you get it? 
  Did you get it? 
  - Yes! 
   Okay. 
  Shh. 
  Let's go. 
   I think we should keep off the main road, okay? 
   Jesus Christ! 
   I think we should call the police. 
   We will. 
   Now? 
   I just... 
  I feel like the sooner we make a call,  - the better, you know? 
  - I said we will. 
   I-I just feel like we should call them now. 
   Let's, let's just... 
   get through here first. 
   - W-what's going on? 
  - Well... 
   Well, why would we call the cops  if we've done nothing wrong? 
   Why wouldn't we call the cops if we've done nothing wrong? 
   Okay, look, you know, we-we made a plan,  and you agreed to it, and it did not involve cops,  so let's get through these woods. 
   Let's find a bar, let's have a f*ckin' drink. 
   - Wait, no. 
  - And let's get the f*ck out of here! 
   Wait, you wanna go to a bar? 
   - I need a bathroom. 
  - Just go in the f*ckin' woods! 
   - No, I need a proper bathroom. 
  - I don't care. 
   This is a small town, Ruby, people will see you. 
   Well, I don't care who sees me! 
   I'm innocent, and I have my period! 
   f*ck, okay. 
  Okay. 
   Oh, f*ck. 
   I'm sorry.

   Is it better? 
   If I start rustling,  don't ask questions. 
   - What was your plan? 
  - Geez. 
   I reckon just keeping going till we hit a road. 
   No, with, uh... 
   with Fiona. 
   She said you had plans. 
   Just business plans. 
   She, uh, she thought... 
   she thought, um... 
   I can actually hear rustling. 
  Did you use leaves? 
   I need you to tell me what happened in there. 
   What do you mean? 
   What happened to her? 
   What do you mean? 
   I didn't see what happened. 
   - I just mean that... 
  - Okay. 
   Uh, okay, yeah. 
   Fiona threw the bag out the window... 
   - and then she stepped out after it. 
  - Right. 
   - I saw that bit. 
  - Oh, you saw that bit. 
   Did you? 
  Right, sorry. 
  It's the bit after  where she fell to her death that you're interested in. 
   That's the bit you wanna hear about. 
   - No, I... 
  - No, absolutely, Ruby! 
  Let's go over it. 
   I know I enjoy talking about it. 
   So, Fiona must've seen the hay bale... 
   - and decided to give me a fright, I guess. 
  - Okay. 
   Or something, right? 
  Yeah, so I grabbed her wrist  to pull her back in,  and she screamed,  and then she lifted her foot to get back in, I think,  and she, uh, she slipped and fell. 
   - Just "she slipped"? 
  - Or, possibly, she jumped. 
  I... 
   Were you holding her wrist at this point? 
   What are you accusing me of? 
   - I don't know. 
  - Do you think I murdered her? 
   I didn't say that. 
   There's one right answer to that question. 
   Do you seriously think I'm the sort of person  to push someone out of a f*ckin' window? 
   No, I'd hope not... 
   - but... 
  - Good. 
  "But"? 
   But I don't know. 
   - I haven't seen you for 15 years. 
  - Mm. 
   Yeah, you're right. 
   Yeah. 
  Okay. 
  No, you're right. 
  You're right. 
   Yeah, who knows what I'm capable of? 
   I'm probably capable of all sorts of nasty sh1t. 
   There is one thing that I know that I'm not capable of though. 
   There's one thing I know that I would never do,  and that is to have two children  and then walk away from them  to go and f*ck an ex-boyfriend on a train. 
   I wouldn't do that. 
   And I'm the violent one? 
   - Apologize! 
  - I will not! 
   Apologize for that! 
   No! 
  No, no, no, no, this is not your turn to freak out! 
   This is my freak out time! 
   My business partner is lying on a f*ckin' spike back there! 
   My career is over  'cause I made a man kill himself! 
   My girlfriend has got a secret f*ckin' family,  and now I'm running away from what's gonna look like a crime scene  'cause you don't wanna go to the police! 
   I didn't say that I didn't wanna go to the police! 
   I said I didn't wanna go to the police  until I'd had a f*cking drink. 
   I'm actually very happy to talk to the police, thanks. 
   She's from out of town? 
   Best guess, she's from out of state. 
   Okay. 
   No car. 
   Must've walked or hitched. 
   Somehow knew Daniel Gober,  or didn't. 
   Then pitched up at Daniel's house  and fell, or didn't, out of that window. 
   - Wow. 
  - Yeah. 
   This is big. 
   Maybe it was a farming accident? 
   I don't think so. 
   - I mean, she's not dressed like a farmer. 
  - Yeah. 
   Well, there was always something weird about Daniel Gober. 
   - These are suspicious circumstances. 
  - Yeah. 
   I wish it wasn't the final episode tonight. 
   Oh! 
  I know. 
   It's starting in 45. 
   Well, we can't do much until forensics... 
   - Forensics gets here. 
  Exactly. 
  - Yeah. 
   I mean, how long is that gonna be? 
   I don't know. 
  I never called them before. 
   We should, uh, probably cordon it off. 
   Yeah. 
  You do it. 
   No, you do it. 
   - No, you do it. 
  - No, you do it. 
   Fine. 
   Someone should visit the woman that reported this. 
   - Okay. 
  - Good luck. 
   But if you text me and tell me who gets voted out again,  I swear you're a dead man. 
   Yeah, got it. 
   Ruby! 
   Ruby. 
   Ruby? 
   - I'm sorry I slapped you... 
  - Oh, Jesus! 
  Ruby! 
   You did that on purpose! 
   But, I have not abandoned my kids. 
   Well, you have. 
   Will you just shut up? 
   Shut up! 
  You don't know anything! 
   You have no idea what my life was like! 
   I would imagine quite middle class and boring. 
   Yeah, exactly! 
   - You f*cking asshole! 
  - What are you doing? 
   God! 
   I just needed to take one minute when I wasn't the machine. 
   Yes, I'm lucky. 
  Yes, I'm grateful. 
   And yes, I'm guilty about every single f*cking thing I do. 
   I'm haunted by being a bad mom and a bad wife,  but I am those things. 
   And I'm also  a brilliant mom and a brilliant wife! 
   I know that my life before Laurence and the kids  wasn't interesting and I wasn't even happy,  but still, I didn't think  that I would have to hand it over. 
   I don't know what happened, but suddenly,  I was expected to just hand my life over. 
   Suddenly, it belonged to other people,  two of whom... 
   are tiny and adorable. 
   But they have no idea what they have taken from me! 
   And I'm so scared that my unhappiness will hurt them. 
   And I just wanted to be seen. 
   And after f*cking years... 
   of trying to do it the right way,  it seems that the most effective method that I have found  is to disappear. 
   I'm glad you disappeared to me. 
   When I saw that picture on your phone... 
   - it broke my heart. 
  - You can't be upset with me... 
   - ...that I have kids. 
  - I'm not upset that you have kids. 
   I'm upset you don't have my kids. 
   Oh. 
   I didn't want ginger kids. 
   What the f*ck? 
   What the f*ck... 
   I wanted your kids, too. 
   But, you didn't. 
   You literally didn't. 
   We were so young, Billy. 
   You just got rid of it. 
   You didn't tell me. 
   I would've wanted it. 
   You didn't know what you wanted. 
   Neither of us did. 
   If we go to the police,  I will lose them. 
   You didn't do anything wrong. 
   If we go to the police,  Laurence will find out that I was here  with you,  and I will lose them. 
   Jesus. 
   The things we do for a shag. 
   Where are we going? 
   We're gonna go and get you a drink,  and I'm gonna go to the police... 
   'cause I have to do the right thing. 
   You were never there. 
   Uh, evening, ma'am. 
   Uh, have you, um... 
   Did you call the police tonight, ma'am? 
   - Yeah, I did. 
  - Uh, I'm... 
  I'm, uh,  Chief Deputy Sheriff, uh, Babe Cloud. 
   I'm, uh, instigating, uh,  a possible murder case that's connected to  Daniel Gober. 
  I mean, one, one Daniel Gober. 
   Do you know that gentle... 
  gentle... 
  Gober? 
   Wanna come in? 
   Yes, please. 
   - I'm sorry about the mess. 
  - No, no. 
   - Gotta get my little buddies in the icebox. 
  - Little buddies? 
   Squirrels, woodchuck, a deer. 
   Did you, uh, kill all of these? 
   Mm. 
  But only in self-defense. 
   This guy was a real vicious little asshole. 
   - Oh. 
  - Made a friend? 
   He's, uh, watching me. 
   - Through his glass eyes? 
  - From his soul. 
   Oh, the limbs aren't supposed to bend. 
   They actually bend easier the more you move 'em. 
   Do you wanna sit down? 
   Oh, uh, I'm okay. 
   Uh, it's the vest. 
  It's just hard for me to sit comfortably. 
   Do you wanna take it off? 
   Uh, I can't do it on my own. 
  Ryan usually... 
   Oh, wow! 
  Thank you. 
   - Okay. 
  - Uh, let's... 
   Uh... 
   Oh. 
   Just gonna use this notepad. 
   Um... 
   Did you know Mr. 
  Gober well? 
   He brings me roadkill, and I make him mac and cheese. 
   Is he okay? 
   Um, we haven't been able to locate him yet. 
   He didn't do it. 
   Okay. 
  Um,  just writing that down. 
   Um, does Daniel have a girlfriend? 
   - No. 
  - No. 
   And do you have a girlfriend? 
   No. 
   - Do you have a girlfriend? 
  - No. 
   No... 
   If Daniel's hiding, it's because he's scared. 
   Not because he did it. 
   Did you see anything unusual  when you brought the mac and cheese  to Mr. 
  Gober's? 
   Well, there was a woman on a spike. 
   Yeah, uh, before or after. 
   Um, did you see anything or anyone? 
   - Well, I picked up a badger around 7:00. 
  - Oh. 
   And then I gave a couple of hikers a lift to the station. 
   - Can I see the badger? 
  - Oh, sure. 
   - She's not ready. 
  - Uh, no... 
  it was a joke. 
   - Oh! 
  - The hikers. 
   - Oh yeah, the hikers. 
  - Now... 
   do you remember anything about the hikers? 
   Uh... 
   Well, there was a man and a woman. 
   Uh, he was shivering, so I gave him my coat. 
   I have a slot at the Thirsty Cactus. 
   Can we do this there? 
  We can have a drink. 
   - Um, probably... 
  - Great! 
  Give me one second. 
   Goddamn it, Ryan! 
   You need to head the other way. 
   You shouldn't be following me. 
   - People will see us together. 
  - Listen... 
   - Hey. 
  - No, no, no! 
  Wait, wait, listen. 
  Um... 
   - Let's call it in anonymously. 
  - No. 
   Wait! 
  Just, just, just... 
   - Hey. 
  - Wait, no, no, no! 
  Sit down! 
  Wait, wait,  gimme a second! 
  Let's talk about this. 
   Think about your career. 
   Ruby, two people have died in a week 'cause of my career. 
   It's hardly an advert for a f*ckin' life coach. 
   You know what? 
  They were both on their own journey! 
   Are you quoting me now? 
   Oh, no, no. 
  I thought that was just a cliché thing to say. 
   Jesus Christ. 
   What if they don't think it was an accident? 
   What if they think that you did it? 
   - Yeah, but what if I did do it though? 
  - But you didn't! 
   I-I didn't push her, right? 
   But, I... 
   I did let her go. 
   What? 
   She was... 
   she was f*ckin' screaming at me. 
   She was saying, "Let go, let go,  f*cking let go of me." And I... 
   Well... 
   - That's not wrong. 
  - Isn't it? 
   What was I thinking when I did it though? 
  Did I want her to die? 
   - Did I know she was gonna die? 
  - No! 
   I let go of her f*ckin' wrist, Ruby! 
   - I let her go! 
  - You didn't know! 
   We are the only ones who know what happened. 
   If I don't go and tell the truth now,  I'm gonna look like a suspect. 
   I'm... 
  I'm linked to her. 
   I-I puked all over that place. 
   I-I have to go and tell them it was an accident  before they think that I ran, okay? 
   Just... 
   - Billy... 
  - I know, I know, I know. 
 
 
 
   I know what's at stake for you. 
   It's your choice what you do now,  but we're gonna have to just... 
   deal with our sh1t at some point. 
   Okay? 
  I-I let her go. 
   I did that. 
   You did leave your husband. 
   You did... 
   start an affair with me,  and that's the truth. 
   If you ask me, at some point,  we're just gonna have to tell the f*cking truth,  and deal with the f*cking consequences  before they bite us in the f*cking ass. 
   I mean, I can't blame it. 
  You got such a nice ass. 
   Something's gonna bite it. 
   I'm not doin' it to be brave, okay? 
   I'm doin' it 'cause I'm scared. 
   Okay. 
   Yeah, okay. 
   I'll do it, too.

   - Yeah, well, she had a slot.

   How about we take a short break? 
   You didn't have to stay for that. 
   Well, I, um,  I had a bunch more questions to ask you, so... 
   I get louder every week. 
   It's just good for me to do something in front of people. 
   I spend a lot of time with dead animals. 
   I thought you were just won... 
   Um... 
   What size are your feet? 
   - This to do with Daniel? 
  - Oh, I-I can't tell you... 
   - Or are you gonna buy me shoes? 
  - No! 
   No, I am not gonna... 
   - buy you anything. 
  - What'd you find? 
   I-I can't tell you that. 
   Well, a-a footprint. 
  Uh... 
   So, if you could just tell me, uh... 
   - what size your... 
  - So you can eliminate me? 
   - I can't... 
  - Do you think I did it? 
   I... 
  I ca.. 
  No. 
   - But if you tell me your shoe... 
  - Eight. 
   Thank you. 
   Eight. 
   Eight... 
   And then if there's anything else you could tell me about  the two people that you met. 
   Yeah, she... 
  she had a pretty name. 
   Like a jewel or something. 
   I-I can't remember. 
   - That's all I got. 
  - Okay. 
   A needy blonde and a guy in a woman's coat. 
   Um... 
   Thank you. 
   - So, you off duty? 
  - Um... 
   Yeah, I guess. 
  Yeah. 
   What do you want? 
   Well, seeing as you won't buy me a drink, it's on me. 
   - You wanna have a drink with me? 
  - Sure. 
   Okay. 
  But I would like to buy you the-the drink. 
   - Oh, hey, Lottie.

  You were gone a while. 
   Found this. 
   I was getting all sentimental,  looking up where we'd be now if we were still on it. 
   Where would we be? 
   The next town. 
   Really? 
   Thought we'd be further along than that. 
   Uh, it's on a... 
  a stopover. 
   They just... 
   wait for, like, six hours. 
   - Our train is, like, one town away? 
  - Yep. 
   - Just sittin' there? 
  - Yep. 
   I mean, if we got on it now... 
   you know, it'd be like we never got off. 
   We could get your coat. 
   - I-I do love that f*cking coat. 
  - I know. 
   I think we should get to Union Station. 
   Like we always said we would. 
   - That's the only promise we made. 
  - We said we were gonna... 
   You know, we can call them from the train. 
   That sheriff's coming over. 
  Why are you doing this? 
   If we don't get to LA, we end here. 
   I don't wanna end here.
