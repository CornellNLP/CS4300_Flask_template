 Previously on Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce... 
 I know you guys are getting a divorce. 
 We're not getting a divorce. 
 Abby, yes, we are. 
 I only want to see you. 
 Does that make you my boyfriend? 
 We know you're not a shoplifter. 
 Who are you trying to protect? 
 The only way out of our situation is if I'm at least open to the casual encounter. 
 Abby McCarthy, this is Kori Wingo. 
 The photographer. Oh, my God, I love your work. 
 That's a hot photo. 
 Kind of looks like you. 
 It's not. 
 I'm a divorce attorney. 
 I see it all the time. 
 Love turns to contempt. 
 Sometimes. 
 That's not the only story. 
 I'm so jealous of whoever gets you next because, I mean, I was in the trenches doing all that hard stuff, and whoever gets you next is just gonna get the win. 
 Sold. Hot mama takes it down. 
 What was that about? 
 This isn't gonna work. 
 I just can't live up to your expectations. 
 You supported me in a lot of ways, and it occurred to me that I never actually thanked you for that. 
 Oh, my God. 
 [doorbell rings] 
 Well, that's Will. [knocking on door] 
 Credit So you've adopted a Nepalese dog? 
 More like a Nepalese creature that minored in rat and majored in dog. 
 Basically, he's tiny and ferocious. 
 [laughs] 
 Charlie, morning. 
 Hey, butthead. 
 Hey, Charlie. 
 That's okay. 
 We have agreed that's gonna be my nickname. 
 Oh, really? Did you now? 
 That's so interesting. Charlie, come back here. 
 Uh-oh. 
 No cartoons until you've at least had some milk. 
 All right, buddy? 
 Ugh, milk, it's too white. 
 It's too white? 
 Very white. 
 Is your sister still sleeping? 
 Duh, she's a teenager. 
 Mmm. 
 So stupid. 
 Duh. 
 Oh, my God, this is amazing. 
 So is that, by the way. 
 I meant to tell you, this necklace is absolutely beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 Um, Jake just gave it to me. 
 Did he? 
 Yeah. 
 That's very magnanimous of him. 
 That is so funny, because I used that word in our divorce settlement meeting because it is all done. 
 We are signing this week. 
 Let's celebrate. 
 Yes, we should. 
 No kids this weekend, right? 
 No, they're with Jake. 
 So let's drive down to Baja. 
 No, no, no, not the "Senor Frogs, papas y beer" Baja. 
 I have a friend who runs a posada on this private little stretch of beach. 
 And we can spend the day sunning and reading.

 So HuffPost is telling me I have super-high Q scores. 
 Q for quite awesome? 
 Q for quotient. 
 I don't know what that means. Q for good. 
 And Cat says she thinks a book deal is around the corner. 
 All right. 
 Mm-hmm.

 You get the big Q, the books, the hot fetus, and I get to take my kid to her first shrink session. Whoo! 
 What are we doing here, anyway? It's not even a real lake, and people are acting like they're too hip to sweat. 
 Not everyone. 
 Ooh, I like the east side. 
 So much to see over here.

 [indistinct chatter] 
 Um, Phoebe, are you and Marco still on the outs? 
 Because there is a live one to my right that keeps looking over at you. 
 Oh, outs, outs. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm good. 
 I'm just tired. 
 You know what we need? We need to have some fun. 
 How about a fiesta? 
 Yes. 
 A celebration for ditching the deadbeats. 
 A divorce party? 
 A fiesta. 
 Oh, no, I don't think so. 
 Yeah, come on. Mark the milestone, Abby. 
 A little bit of tequila and maybe, like, burning a Jake-shaped effigy? 
 Mama, you need this. 
 It's really important to mark this moment. 
 I don't know. 
 Thank you very much for the idea, but no. 
 I... I just want to stay positive. 
 I want to focus on this... 
 all : Good divorce. 
 Do I say that a lot? 
 No. 
 [laughs] That's embarrassing. 
 I've never heard that before in my life. 
 Okay, well, you guys are all off the hook. 
 No more happy divorce talk, because I'm gonna give my brother a hug. 
 No, really? Is that good? 
 Well, I mean, the client's always right, so... 
 [laughs] 
 Okay, Duncan, you think everything is sexy. 
 Um, uh, yeah. 
 Yeah, me too. Bye. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Wow. Who was that, Flirty Pants? 
 Just calm down. It's a work thing. 
 It was the Getty guy. 
 Getty guy? Oh, that guy that kissed you. 
 Not like that. 
 They loved my plans for the south terrace, and I'm in. 
 That's incredible. 
 It is, it is. 
 So what's going on with you? 
 Oh. 
 I've reached out. 
 I know, sorry. 
 We... we've both been, like, crazy busy. 
 Are things better? 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. 
 It's all love and trust and forgiveness at our place and... 
 It's a longer conversation. 
 Look, I got to run, Abs. 
 Come on. 
 I'll... I'll call you, promise. 
 Kori : Anouk, Luco, over here. 
 Um, they forgot their backpacks. 
 See, big smile. 
 Hey, Kori. 
 Kori? Hello, Kori? 
 Oh. 
 What are you doing? 
 You're not supposed to take pictures of other people's kids. 
 School rules. 
 It's for the school. 
 They asked me to. It's for the yearbook. 
 Hey, Mom. 
 Hi, Mom. 
 Wow. Hey, hey, honeys. How are you? 
 You forgot your backpacks. 
 Sorry, Mom. 
 Sorry. 
 They are beautiful, by the way. 
 Not a surprise. 
 I don't give you permission to take pictures of my kids, Kori. 
 Hey, hey, I thought we left things in a good place, you know? 
 I just... I feel like you've got some unfinished business with me. 
 Wow, unfinished business? 
 Is that... Is that what you call it? 
 Okay, wow. You know what? 
 I have been really cool to you since we got here, and all I'm getting from you is hostility, so... 
 Hey, sweetie, hang on, just one... couple more, okay? 
 Stay right there, all right? Thank you. 
 You know what, I don't want you to take pictures, Kori. 
 Did you not listen to me? I said stop. 
 Would you just stop? You're not listening to me. 
 Hey, are you... Are you listening to me? 
 I said stop! 
 Whoa, what is your problem? 
 Don't touch me! You are! 
 You are my problem! 
 Do you not get that? 
 God. 
 Come on. 
 Wow. 
 Let's go. Just go. 
 It's all right. It's all right, children. 
 Okay... 
 Stay away from my children. 
 woman : It's okay. 
 Wow. She's totally insane. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Okay, now that we have settled Camp Pontiac... 
 Oh, actually, I changed my mind on that. 
 I don't want them... I don't want them going there at all. 
 Y-you what? 
 I'm kidding. I'm fine. [laughter] 
 Or course, right? 
 Right. 
 We are good on everything. 
 Then we will have it written up. 
 We'll messenger it over to Abby. 
 She'll sign it. Then we'll send it over to Jake. 
 Then we file, and... 
 Sign it away. 
 That's that. 
 That's that. 
 That's that. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I got to go. 
 Jake, talk to you soon. 
 All right. Thank you. 
 Abby... 
 Oh, thanks. 
 I just want to say that I was very impressed at the way you two handled yourselves. 
 Well, there you go. 
 I know. 
 Delia, a pleasure as always. 
 Okay, I need to borrow this one for a moment. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Hey, you, awesome divorce. 
 We kicked divorce ass. 
 [laughs] 
 You okay? Need some water? 
 Scotch? 
 No. 
 Scotch and water? 
 I'm fine. 
 I feel relieved. 
 'Cause last week, you were decidedly not fine. 
 I just want to get through this. 
 I want to move on. 
 Yeah. 
 How's your love life? 
 The same. 
 I just want to get through this partnership meeting. 
 Once that's settled, maybe I can think about it. 
 Yeah, well, break a leg or break a brief; I don't know what you break. 
 Break something. Break something good. 
 Oh, hey, I got the invite to your divorce party. 
 No, I didn't say I was gonna... I didn't say I was... 
 Are we really gonna paintball your wedding dress? 
 Holy sh1t. 
 All right. 
 Great, thank you. 
 Okay. 
 What? 
 Um... 
 A book deal. 
 Mom! 
 I know. 
 Does this mean I can get the new iPhone? 
 Um, I... I... 
 I'm kidding. 
 Okay. 
 Mom, I told you, I don't want anything. 
 You have to eat something. 
 I am not hungry. 
 I'll wait in the car. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I'll go talk to her. 
 Did she just found out about therapy? 
 Are you okay? 
 No. Distract me. 
 Distract you, okay, I have a few things. 
 There is a bidding war on Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce, a book deal. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 And this divorce party you're throwing me, I never said you could do that. 
 You said I could throw you a divorce party. 
 I was not sure. 
 Yes, you did. 
 Which is what everybody says. 
 Nobody wants to be all, "Wah, make me a party." 
 You know you want it. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Are you telling me that "maybe" means "yes" in your world? 
 That is a very dangerous concept in many circumstances. 
 It's gonna be fun. 
 Phoebe gave me a list of all the cool moms at school. 
 There are no cool moms at our school. 
 I didn't realize there are so many cool moms. 
 There are zero cool moms. 
 Yeah, there are. 
 There are, like, 20, 30, 40, 50. 
 I sent out all the invites. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Fine, celebrate me, but I am against it officially. 
 I refuse to enjoy it. 
 A toast to Ms. Delia here, our very own pit bull in Manolos. 
 Hear, hear. 
 To know her is to love her and to fear her. 
 Thank you. It has always been my dream. 
 Well, as you might have guessed, we have some good news for you. 
 You don't get champagne and flowers with bad news. 
 Your work has been outstanding, and getting Gordon back on board made this a no-brainer. 
 We're making you a partner. 
 [applause] 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. I am thrilled. What are the terms? 
 Well, non-equity to start, and a three-year non-compete clause, so if you leave... 
 Wait, wait, wait, Ed Roe got full equity partnership last year, and he's been here three years less than me. 
 Delia, come on. 
 Am I to understand that he's more valuable than me? 
 Look at our billable hours. 
 Of course not. You are valu... 
 This deal that you're offering asks me to sign away three years of my freedom. 
 For what? 
 Partnership at this firm is a game changer regardless of the financials. 
 O'Melveny has been trying to poach me for a year as an equity partner. 
 You have 24 hours to either take this girl seriously, or I'm done. 
 Delia. 
 Wow. 
 [phone rings] 
 Sorry. Sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 What were you saying about separation anxiety? 
 Right, it sounds like Zooey was removed from the family home pretty abruptly. 
 Does that feel right to you? 
 I do think that I've been feeling a bit, um, invisible. 
 Maybe that contributed to... 
 Okay, but you understand why I want to get her out of there with that crazy-ass father of hers? Hello. 
 Mom, you're rightfully mad at Zooey's dad. 
 Yeah. 
 But it's not helpful for her to have you calling him names or speaking badly about him. 
 Oh, man, has... has that ship sailed. 
 I mean, hello? 
 I'm Puerto Rican, so we curse out inanimate objects. 
 I mean, you know, we're passionate people. 
 Right, understood, but... 
 We love hard, and we hate hard, and Zooey knows that about me, and her father, he's white, but he's a Jew. 
 So he's still nuts. 
 Mom, I hear you. 
 Yeah. 
 But let's let Zooey talk and you listen, okay? 
 All right. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Ooh, heavy. 
 Not just emotionally.

 Is it true what Mom says about Dad and Mom? 
 Is there a lot of yelling and fighting? 
 It's true, but I mostly trained myself to tune it out. 
 Hmm. 
 But even when we try to tune stuff out, a little always gets in, right?

 Don't tell me this is one of these "blame the parents" things.

 Hey, Mom, this thing is about understanding Zooey's feelings, because when we pretend we don't have them, these feelings express themselves anyway, like in the form of a cry for help, like shoplifting. 
 Now, I'd like to talk to Zooey alone. 
 It smells awfully good in here for a business meeting. 
 Oh, trust me, it's gonna be one of those dinners where we debate the virtues of calystegia macrostegia versus lathyrus laetiflorus alefeldii. 
 Mmm, I love when you speak floral to me. 
 Well, now you do, because I'm leaving, when in real life, it just bores you to death.

 Look, man, call your boy toy. I can't help you. 
 No, um, I just thought, uh, that it might be easier if you and I signed these together, preferably with some alcohol in hand?

 You mean, like, a "we got in this together, let's get out of it together" thing? 
 Yeah. Right?

 Thank you. 
 Enough of the mushy stuff. Go to class. 
 Bye, Mama. 
 Bye. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 [sighs] It's just... 
 Kori... She's a player, and she is gonna spin this and make me look crazier than I already look. 
 Which is exactly why you're gonna go in there and explain why you did what you did. 
 And by the way, you did nothing wrong. 
 She did. 
 You got this. 
 Thank you. 
 [inhales] 
 Okay. 
 We have your back, honey, always. 
 You're not alone. 
 No one's ever said that to me. 
 Well, Jesus, it is about time somebody did. 
 Thank you. 
 [sighs] 
 So good. 
 You put a clock on it? 
 Yes, 25 hours from the meeting, which is about an hour from now. 
 God, those guys would be jackasses to lose you to O'Melveny. 
 And plus, it'd be a one-two punch, 'cause I'd go with you. 
 But about my offer... 
 Hmm. 
 Thoughts? 
 I want to counter. 
 Of course you do. 
 Marriage is... 
 Once people are legally bound, this kind of apathy sets in. 
 It's just... the chase is off, and the next thing you know, you're screaming about toilet paper. 
 Think about you and Courtney. This happens. 
 That's not a counter. 
 That's a statement. 
 I have been hurt. 
 So it is difficult for me because of my prior romantic relationship to trust my own emotions. 
 You were blindsided? 
 Completely, mm-hmm. 
 If, in fact, I can trust my emotions, then the facts are that I am in love with you... 
 Madly. 
 I want to be with you for the rest of our lives. 
 Delia... 
 Just not as man and wife. 
 I want to show my devotion to you by sharing a home with you and a life with you and possibly even a child, but I don't ever want to take you for granted and vice versa. 
 Well, thank you for helping me understand, but my answer is no. 
 I'm not... I'm not trying to play hardball. 
 I wish I could be content with that, but I'm a traditional guy. 
 I want you to be my wife. 
 I want the whole world to know that I'm yours and you're mine. 
 So it's your way or the highway? 
 I wouldn't say it like that. 
 It's more like two people who want different things. 
 I should get dressed. 
 Hey. 
 For the record, I never felt about Courtney the way I feel about you. 
 Oh. 
 How is it that Jo is throwing you a party which is really for Jo, and she's not even here to help? 
 I wasn't even invited, so... 
 both : Aww. 
 That's 'cause it's a girl party. 
 Oh, how dare you? 
 Hey! 
 I came to help with the party, and I bring booze, of which I sampled in the Uber. 
 [chuckles] 
 So day drinking... Good news, bad news? 
 Both! So I get to double drink. 
 I just got the call. 
 I made partner with an equity share and no non-compete. 
 Wow. 
 What? 
 And I'm single. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, Delia. 
 Pfft. 
 Uh, you know what? I'm gonna get going. 
 I've got to go pack for Baja. 
 Right. 
 And I've got to meet Jake in a little while anyways, sign those papers. 
 Oh, they're gonna have a paper-signing date. 
 It's not a date. 
 No, no, not a date. 
 It's not a date. 
 Because I just do! Why do you need to understand? 
 Because I'm not putting you on a plane to crazy town until I do, okay? 
 I want to see Dad. 
 Okay, your dad's with that bitch Charlene, okay? 
 They're in the South. You're gonna hate it. 
 Mother, I just want to visit him, and you act like I'm abandoning you! 
 You are. 
 No, I'm not. 
 That man doesn't deserve your loyalty. 
 Forget it, okay?

 Here we go. 
 Yup. 
 Should we just drink first? 
 Yeah, let's have a drink, sure. 
 That would be nice. 
 Yes. 
 both : Cheers. 
 What did Jo say? 
 She says... in that Jo way... 
 She ways, "I would rather eat sh1t than that." 
 No, she said "farts." 
 No, that doesn't make any sense. Nobody eats farts. 
 No, because it's scatologically incorrect, and that's why I remember it. 
 Whatever, fine. 
 The point is... 
 Besides that it was gross. 
 Our first date, Jo and Frumpkis were there with us. 
 I mean, how weird is that? How romantic. 
 Yeah, but that wasn't a date. 
 Come on, technically, in New York, we were just hooking up. 
 Eh. 
 Yes. 
 Our first date was not until you moved to Los Angeles. 
 Oh, okay, Frumpkis-free, you're saying? 
 [laughs] 
 All right, we're avoiding and torturing ourselves. 
 Yeah, come on, whip out the special pen.

 Jo had me drop off some stuff for the party, carrots and celery 'cause I'm a farmer. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I need to apologize to you again. 
 I'm just taking stuff out on you that is so not about you. 
 You want to tell me what it is about? 
 I told you I left home when I was really young. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Look, I want you to understand that the business isn't always like this, but there is a part of it that preys on people like me. 
 I was young and lost and broken, and Kori was this famous photographer, and she ran in a really bad circle. 
 It's not a big deal. 
 I mean, it happens to women all the time. 
 What happens? 
 If the photographer liked you, sometimes you were required to party with them because that's what would get you jobs and make you money and make you famous. 
 Phoebe, we don't have to talk about this now. 
 No, I need to talk about this. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
 I was 14. 
 And Kori decided that she liked me. 
 And I was shy, you know, and so she fed me pills and drinks to loosen me up. 
 And she would take me places and introduce me to people, and I don't really remember what happened. 
 And sometimes afterwards, I would see photos. 
 There were so many photos. 
 [sighs] 
 I don't... 
 I wasn't even there. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 And nobody stopped it. 
 Nobody cared, and we were children. 
 Come here, babe. 
 Shh. 
 It's okay, Phoebe. 
 You know, Will seems like a solid, very young guy. 
 [both laugh] 
 He is. 
 He does. He does. 
 He is. I mean, I feel like I'm dating a time bomb, you know? 
 One day it's just gonna go off, and he's gonna be all, "Dude, you're old." 
 Ha! I know the feeling. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 So, uh, here's some news. 
 Mm? 
 Remember Joseph Gordon-Levitt dropped out of my thing because he was gonna do the Rian Johnson Ukraine movie? 
 both : Yeah. 
 So Rian Johnson dropped out of the Ukraine project. 
 Joe thought of me and talked to the producers, and... 
 Joe, really? Oh, my God. 
 He goes by Joe, okay?

 Joseph Gordon-Levitt thought of me and talked to the producers, and they liked my ideas, and they want me. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Yeah. 
 So... 
 Hey. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Right, so tight budget, tight schedule. 
 Yeah.

 In Ukraine? 
 In Latvia, and it's a four-month shoot.

 Okay, wow. 
 Amazing. Impeccable timing. 
 Not heard from her in weeks, but here she is. 
 Oh, just babes to the babes, right? 
 Yeah, I guess so. 
 Four months. 
 Four. Wow.

 I got to get back because Jo's gonna kill me if I don't get home soon. 
 Let me walk you to your car. 
 Okay. 
 Mm. 
 [clears throat] 
 So... 
 So... 
 [both laugh] 
 Well, congratulations again. 
 Talk to you later. 
 Okay. 
 [both laughing] 
 Hey, Jake? 
 [clears throat] 
 Just so you know, the night of the epic walk... 
 Mm-hmm? 
 I actually knew that you didn't lose your keys because I felt them in your pocket. 
 Why didn't you say anything? 
 Because I didn't want the night to end. 
 Okay. [laughs] 
 Okay. Abby? 
 Yeah? 
 Just because we signed the papers doesn't mean we have to file them. 
 What? 
 Maybe this is what we needed, time apart to figure our own sh1t out and become Jake and Abby 2.0, better versions of ourselves, of us. 
 I'm saying, what if we gave this thing one more shot? 
 Are you okay? 
 How can you... we just... 
 Now, we're done. 
 And you say this now. 
 You can't really be surprised. 
 Surprised? I'm stunned. 
 I am... I am appalled. 
 Appalled, that's a word. 
 All I wanted was for us to stay together! 
 I begged you to give it a chance. 
 Yeah, while you hated my guts. 
 And you hated my guts, but it was not me who told the kids we were getting a divorce. 
 I know, and that... 
 You took that leap, Jake. 
 That was then. 
 I did not do that. 
 That was then. 
 Tell me that living apart hasn't been a game changer. 
 That is not the way to save a marriage. 
 You don't know that. 
 I'm talking about how I feel now, and you have been giving me some serious vibes. 
 I have not. 
 Oh, come on, this has been hard for me, but I am over you, Jake. 
 I have a wonderful new man in my life. 
 Uh-huh, and that's why you wanted to meet tonight. 
 And that's why you wanted me to kiss you the night of the fund-raiser... - I... kiss you? I didn't... 
 After I gave you that necklace that you're wearing. 
 Yeah. 
 You totally wanted me to kiss you. 
 Oh, my God, wanting you to kiss me is very different than me trying to kiss you. 
 Uh-huh. Okay, how about this? 
 "I'm jealous of whoever gets you next"? 
 Yes, because I am. Because I am. 
 Guess what. It's not gonna be me. 
 That's why. You know why? 
 Because we literally tore our lives apart, and we have devastated our children. 
 Who would have been even maybe more screwed up if we had stayed together... 
 Oh, my God. 
 The way that we were. 
 There's no handbook. 
 You're not the answer lady... 
 I'm not trying to be the answer lady! 
 Marriage is not a one-size-fits-all deal, okay? 
 I don't know. You don't know. 
 All I know is that I am still... 
 And screw me, I probably always will be... in love with you. 
 You are mean. 
 Mean? 
 You are mean. You know what this is? 
 This is last-minute jitters. - No. 
 And as usual, you are being impulsive and childish. 
 You know why Becca broke up with me? 
 Because I'm not over you, and you're not over me either. 
 Enough. 
 Everybody knows it. 
 Stop. You know what I'm gonna do right now? 
 I'm gonna go back to my house to my divorce party because we are getting a divorce, okay?

 What? 
 woman : Hi. 
 woman : Hey, Abby. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Where's that goddamn gun? 
 Oh, my God, that's hilarious. 
 I know you've been wanting to do this. 
 I knew you wouldn't listen to me when I said no. 
 Absolutely not, baby. Absolutely not. 
 Oh, my Gosh. 
 It was the '90s. 
 It was the '90s.
