 Previously on "Girlfriend's Guide to Divorce." 
 I'm having a baby. 
 I mean, if you think this is gonna get easier to break to Abby the longer you wait, you are seriously clueless. 
 I'm struggling right now, and I can't get right if I'm with you. 
 You're the sexy face of divorce. 
 We want to see you at gallery openings and fashion shows. 
 Did you say engagement party? 
 Yeah, it's no big deal. Just a few dozen friends. 
 I don't have time to plan an engagement party. 
 You have been living at my house for the past couple of months. Come on, Jo. 
 All this bullshit about it being in my best interest to move out when it was really about you  sliding back into crazy with Jake. 
 Will. 
 We have to talk. 
 Mmm. 
 Thank you very much. 
 You're welcome. 
 Howdy, neighbor. [giggles]

 Hello? 
 You came. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I had a fake date last night. 
 Which consisted of a five-course meal of edibles from which I hope one day to come down. 
 Oh my goodness. 
 I made the babysitter sleep over. 
 Good. 
 And I am just telling you all of this in the spirit of radical honesty. 
 Oh, are we still in the spirit of radical honesty? 
 I enjoyed that so much the first time. 
 That is my pledge to you. 
 I am dedicated to the truth from here on in. 
 Wow. Right? My honest truth to you is that I'm really glad that I'm doing Lilly's driving lesson because you are a terrible driver. 
 Thanks for picking up my slack. 
 It's a lot of fake dates lately. 
 Should I be worried? 
 No, guy last night was so boring. 
 I am looking at your face. 
 So I'm sensing that I should tell them to tone it down with the fake date. 
 I'm just making sure that we're still... 
 We're great. Come on. 
 We are better than great.  
 Aw. 
 We are? 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 Last night, I was trying to tweet about my dumb date. 
 I think I got... Lils. 
 Did you see Daddy's here? 
 Hi, Lilly Vanilly. 
 Daddy's gonna do your driving lesson today instead of me. 
 Daddy's doing it? 
 So much better. 
 Yeah. 
 Why is it better? 
 Mom, you almost killed a kid at school with your car. 
 True. 
 Whoo-hoo, I'm driving! 
 Okay, call us when you get to the liquor store. 
 Yay. 
 Hey, how do you know Dr. Harris? 
 Which doctor? Who? 
 No, not Doctor Who. I wish. 
 No, this guy's on TV. 
 He's, like, an Oprah doctor. 
 Look, he's responding to your tweets. 
 That's so funny. 
 It is, and that's... here's what you should say back. 
 [keyboard clicks] 
 That's hilarious. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, let's do it.

 [upbeat music] 
 Okay. No, I understand. 
 Yeah. 
 No, it's okay. 
 All right, I should go. 
 Okay. 
 Mm-hmm. Bye. 
 [phone beeps] 
 Well, that sounded great. 
 You want to know why my father can't come to my engagement party? 
 Because it's his girlfriend's son birthday, who must be pretty special to him because I didn't even know he existed until today. 
 Or the girlfriend. 
 He's a fool. 
 No, I'm the fool. 
 No, you're not. 
 It's perfectly natural to try. He's your father. 
 Yeah, and he's half-drunk at lunchtime. 
 I'm sorry. Can you try to forget it? 
 'Cause my family's gonna adore you. 
 My mother can't wait to meet you. 
 Mmm, me too. 
 I'm excited. 
 Yeah? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh, is there something my mom can do to help with the wedding? 
 She keeps asking. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Why don't you have Jonathan give her something to do? 
 It would mean so much more coming from you, though. 
 Let her know that you want her involved. 
 Mmm, does she know that I barely want to be involved? 
 [chuckles] 
 Fine. I'll give it some thought. 
 Okay. Bye. Bye.

 Because they're baked. 
 You're in L.A. now. 
 You're in the land of sun and sea, and Baby Cakes, they're kicking our asses with the freaking harpy pastels. 
 We need more frosting. 
 Hi, babies. 
 The angles... hey. 
 Hello, gorgeous. 
 Can I offer you a hot cruffin? 
 Oh. 
 No, you cannot. 
 Stop preying on the newly bruised and single. 
 And you, do not have s*x with him. 
 I believe all I offered was a cruffin. 
 Same difference. What's going on, Sweet Cheeks? 
 How are you? 
 I'm fine. 
 Not bruised. 
 I'm fine. 
 Sad about the whole Marco thing, but he needs to figure things out on his own. 
 Good. 
 Let's talk treats. 
 Delia's engagement party. 
 The theme? 
 Champagne Nights. 
 Meringue floats and cherry tarts. 
 And golden chocolate truffles. 
 [gasping] 
 Excellent, but fix the colors. 
 The colors are fine. 
 The colors are crap! 
 Phoebe, explain to Scott L.A. and its superficial prettiness, please Or explain to your friend here that it's better to get off my ass and deal with her stress, like maybe Tinder up a bloke and get laid? 
 His answer to everything. 
 Love heals, Jo. 
 Go home. 
 I've got everything covered here. 
 He is so... 
 Mm-mm. 
 Trying too hard. Jo? 
 Hmm? 
 You do look a little tense. 
 What's going on? 
 Well, um, Zooey's still with Frumpkis and the beast of the southern wild, and the Paradiso isn't exactly homey. 
 Have you talked to Abby? 
 Mmmmm. 
 Jo, she asked you to move out, not disappear. 
 Let's just say I'm off the Abby train for a bit. 
 Okay. 
 Lay your luscious lips around this. 
 [elevator dings] 
 That was an annoyingly clever little Twitter chat you had with Dr. Harris this morning. 
 Hi. Oh, thank... Annoying and clever? 
 Is that good? 
 As in you tire me with pith, but he wants to go out with you. 
 What do you mean? 
 He didn't say that. 
 He asked to take it offline. 
 That's Twitter for "meet IRL." 
 What's IRL? 
 In Real Life. 
 Oh, that's... that's cute. 
 [phone beeps] 
 Wow, there are so many re-tweets. 
 Yeah, he's got 275,000 followers, and they're already calling you two #Habby. 
 It spiked this A.M. with 59% positive emotional content, which is crazy high, and then it dropped 30%. 
 Why? Because you didn't respond. 
 How do you... 
 We have our algorithms. 
 You get that many mentions and you're not even a couple? 
 You two need to go out. 
 Uh... 
 Look, I-I was fine with all the photo-op dates, but this is... This is feeling silly. 
 I can come up with my own dates. 
 Hey, face. 
 This doctor guy is a very social media savvy semi-celeb, and you're trying to drive traffic to your blog and the new vertical. 
 So if I were you, I'd start figuring out a way how to make that thing happen.

 Getting laid. 
 Quite nice to have 270 degree views. 
 No. Uh-uh. 
 Gabby did a great job renovating...  
 Hm. 
 Very nice. 
 [buzzer blares] 
 Hey. 
 Stop harassing me, stalker. 
 Well, you're not responding to my calls or my many, many stalker-y texts. 
 Well, maybe I need some space. 
 I just need you to talk to me, or at least acknowledge my existence. 
 Fine. 
 What do you want? 
 Can we go for a walk please? 
 Two minutes. 
 I just don't know where you stand on anything. 
 I-I know, because...  
 I can't... I can't read you. 
 I've been all over the place, and I'm sorry about that, but I need you to stop for a second. 
 No, actually physically stop and just look at me for a second. 
 Um, look, Abby and I are... are giving it another shot. 
 Okay? 
 Okay, so that just complicates things that much more. 
 It's not complicated. 
 You're back with Abby. 
 Great. I'm having a baby. Great. 
 Okay, but this is also my baby, and it's another baby in the family. 
 Not in your family. 
 It's my family. 
 So let me ask you this. 
 What do you want, Becca? 
 Because I want to be in your and in our child's life. 
 Always. 
 Okay. That's what I want too. 
 Okay. 
 So how is Abby? 
 How's she dealing with all this? 
 Was she freaked out? 
 Yeah, you know. 
 We both definitely still love each other. 
 I mean, her roommate, Jo... 
 Jake, I'm not... I'm not asking about your relationship. 
 I'm asking how Abby is dealing with the baby. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Um, I haven't found the right time to tell her yet. 
 There's been a lot going on. 
 Seriously? 
 I haven't found the right moment. 
 What a great start for you two. 
 I'm sure she's going to be thrilled when she finds out you're sitting on this little time bomb. 
 What if she flips out, Jake? 
 How are you going to support me when Abby tells you it's her or our baby? 
 *** 
 I mean, you have to wear the red one. 
 We can't both be wearing red. 
 I'll wear something else. Oh, come on. 
 How about you guys all wear red? 
 You'll be so easy to spot. 
 Then I'll know exactly where to bolt when I get attacked by Gordon's people. 
 Oh, they're gonna love you. 
 Have you met his mother yet? Is she sweet? 
 Yeah, we're having dinner tonight. I mean, she seems fine. 
 I just... you know, I don't do mothers or family gatherings or family, you know. 
 Well, who's coming from your side? 
 Nobody, thank God. 
 What about those cousins in Valencia? 
 The ones that invited you to, like, 100 different baby showers? 
 Phoebe, that was eons ago. 
 I know. 
 It would be a little odd to reach out to them now. 
 But family is important. People are important. 
 You realize that when they start disappearing on you. 
 I know, I know. 
 Okay. 
 Classic cocktail look, check. 
 Oh, nice. 
 And I got a new pair of shoes, and if you don't like them, I'm just gonna return them right now. 
 Abby, back me up here. 
 Delia has these lovely cousins in Valencia... 
 Drop it. Seriously, just... 
 Look at that. 
 Oh, yes. 
 Those are yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. 
 Right? 
 Okay. Mm-hmm. 
 Guess who I had a Twitter chat with? 
 Who? 
 Dr. Harris from CNN, that sexy doctor. 
 Oh. He is such a ladies' man. 
 Yes, but he is a yummy ladies' man. 
 What about Will, though? Will is gonna hate this. 
 He's a little bitty baby bear, and he's gonna die. 
 Oh, he's fine. He gets it. 
 No, it's just like a... you know, it's a photo-op. 
 It's a re-branding thing. 
 Right. Of course. 
 So I mean, it's fine. 
 So, Jo just didn't want to shop? 
 Well, now that she's off the Abby train... 
 What happened? 
 She is mad that, um, she had to move. 
 Change is hard. 
 Sure, but, you know, maybe you guys should talk it out. 
 Yeah. Yeah, it's not a big deal. 
 I mean, we're totally fine. Look, I'm texting her right now. 
 "Hi, Jo." 
 Well, this is a fun date. 
 [laughs] 
 Blah... blah... blah. 
 Talking's for dates who are too scared to screw. 
 God!

 Hey, do you have cable? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Yeah, this is the Paradiso. 
 Paradise with an O for "Oh, so many channels to distract you from your desperate, sad lives."

 Is this weird to ask? 
 Hmm? 
 "Game of Thrones" is on tonight, and... 
 Stop. 
 Sorry, I know that was weird. 
 Hells no.

So what a relief. What? Are you serious? I didn't even want to invite these people, now they're rejecting me. What? No... Hmm. I thought you'd be relieved. Oh, Phoebe. Just stop thinking. It's not your strong suit. Delia. I'm going to go get something else to drink. It's okay, Phoebe. Oh, no, there's going be a significant amount of renegotiating. You should see what Delia's clients use to bargain with. And that's why I get everything in writing. [both chuckle] Delia, could I steal you for a moment? Mom, we talked about this. I know, dear, but it's just a little gift. No, it's okay. It's fine. Oh my gosh, what is this? Oh, what did you do? You shouldn't have. Oh, it's my pleasure. I did a little research on the wedding customs in your country. Aw. Uh-huh. Oh my gosh, it's a... Yes, yes. Well, you'll have to forgive my pronunciation. It's a termeh. It's part of the traditional Persian wedding spread, right? I know usually the mother of the bride gives it to her daughter, but I just wanted you to have something to remember the wedding by. Um... Would you excuse me for just a moment? Yes, I... [sighs] Hey, you okay? That looked abrupt. Yeah, well, that's just kind of my personal brand. I'm really sorry that I was such a bitch to you earlier. I'm just so on edge. Hey, it's... I know. It's okay. Thank you, though. I mean, I did overstep my boundaries. No, no. Banais of Valencia are the least of my concerns. It's just Gordon's mother. It's like she thinks she's marrying off the prodigal son to the Princess Jasmine. Okay, well, maybe she's coming on a little bit strong, but I think she means well. And she doesn't even know me. Gordon said she hated Courtney. What do you want to bet it started out like this? All affection and "Let me be your mom," and... oh, it's a setup. Mmmmaybe, maybe not. Look, Delia, our backgrounds are not that different. Nobody told us that sometimes, people stay, and they do their best to love us. And you were right about everything. I am messed up about Marco, and I try to fix everybody else's stuff 'cause I don't have the first clue to fix my own, but look, I am so proud of you for making this huge open-hearted leap. [exhales sharply] Get up. God. [giggles] Hey. Hi. Hey. Where's Shrimp Boy? Mmm. Don't know, don't care. [loud thud] Attention, party people! I just want to thank all you kick-ass people for kicking ass! Are you out of your mind? Especially you two, the happy couple. Adam. You guys are gonna be so happy. Adam, what the hell are you doing? And you know what? [crowd screams, glass shatters] Right here. Get down from here! What are you doing? Get down from there. Get down from there now. I'm ashamed you were ever inside of me. Get down. All right, mate. I think it's time for you to say good night. Yo, easy, bro. As they say, it's not a real party until somebody's forcibly removed. Ow. I bruise easy, okay? Take it easy. Hey. Hey. I'm gonna go. What the hell was that? Don't tell me I missed all the fun. How about you? You okay? You seem a little... dazed. Yes. Jake dropped a huge bomb on me yesterday. Was it a baby-shaped bomb?  Yeah. Good, I'm glad he finally manned up and told you. I mean, Max and I both told him to... Well, how long have you known? Uh, not 100% sure... How long have you known? Um, I'm gonna say a while. Abby, wait. For what it's worth, he was trying... Abby... Oh, sh1t. [door slams] Oh gosh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. It's okay. No. He, like, ruined the party. Forget it. I'm so sorry. No. It's not like he melted the butter sculpture. You have a butter sculpture? Jo. Oh. Look, the next time you decide to Tinder date, will you call me first? I could've told you that was gonna end in a disaster. The guy's a classic number one. Number one? What's a number one? I've done my fair share of swiping. Okay. You can pretty much break down the types of guys that date older or divorced women. Oh. Number one. Do tell. Young guys. Okay. Like, under 30 young. They age up because they figure you're a sure thing. You do not under any circumstance bring them out in public. Go on. He's a toy. Okay. He's a boy. That's it. That's fascinating. Number two, the never-been-married guy. Nine times out of ten, creepy like a serial killer. Pass. Okay. Number three, newly divorced and looking to unearth his long-buried libido. He's charming, but he's gonna stop messaging you as soon as he bags a 26-year-old. Oh, that freaking prick. Number four, just divorced. Lonely and looking to reconstitute a family. He will be your instant boyfriend, and then he will attach to you like a barnacle and suffocate you. I'm just... I'm so happy that we're having this conversation. So from now on, I'm number one-ing in private. Oh, no violence. And you're right, because it's live. So she's not gonna... No, right. Um, Carol, I'm sorry about... I... I really appreciate your gesture. That was lovely. I understand I overstepped. The thing is that I just... I barely remember my mom or Iran, but um, you made a wonderful man who I love, and we have that in common. So let's just take it slow. Okay. Thank you. Good. Would you maybe help me with the seating arrangement for the reception? You know where the bodies are buried, right? Put mortal enemies together. Oh, I'd love to. Yes? Yes. Okay, good. That's good. Good. This is the part where you hug. He's such a control freak. So bossy. [chuckling] [dog barks] Hey. How dare you? How what? You let me sit there and commend you on your growth as a person? On how open and honest you were? How long have you known that Becca was pregnant? Shh, the kids are sleeping. Calm down. No, I... how long have you known? Answer the damn question. Whoa. About a month. Oh my God. But she didn't know if she was going to keep it, and there was no reason to tell you. So you then, like old times, decided that it was better for me not to know while we're talking about future? And radical honesty? You knew that you might be a father again. You knew that our kids might have a half-sibling. It's unbelievable Just... Jesus Christ, okay? You know, it hasn't been exactly easy to share with you, Abby. I've been very clear. I am in. I am all in, and you're the one with one foot out. What? Just like old times. I don't... I'm trying to think. I'm trying to think and just slow things down, and you as usual just want to dive in. Damn the consequences. No, you're not... A baby. That is a huge omission. I know. You didn't tell me about Will until you had some moral epiphany because I told you about Becca. Will does not affect the rest of our lives. Oh, no, Will affects my life, because here I am again wondering if I can trust you. Again. Well, then that just goes both ways, because I can't do this anymore, Jake. I can't keep letting you "yes" me to death while you sidestep feelings. That's not what happened. That's what killed us. Okay, fine. It's my fault. It's all my fault, Abby. Yeah, you know what? It kind of is. [scoffs] ♪ The orange was the size of a watermelon to me ♪
