 Previously on "Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce"... 
 Something's really wrong. It hurts. 
 You're gonna have to remain on bed rest for the rest of your pregnancy. 
 I have a guesthouse, whatever you need. 
 Frumpkis' new wife is coming to the bakery today. 
 It was Robert's money that funded the bakery. 
 That makes it half ours. 
 This is Joaquin. 
 I'm an artist. 
 Let me take you out. 
 I want a huge, crazy wedding. 
 I'm not anybody's blushing bride! 
 You want to play, mouse? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Are you having fun, Albert? 
 You're feisty. I like it. 
 You okay? 
 I had a bad date. 
 My husband left me for my sister. 
 You want to be the new face of divorce? 
 This is what the real face of divorce looks like. 
 Is this covered by my insurance? 
 Put down whatever it is you're eating, take off whatever it is you're wearing, and lay down on the bed. 
 Tell me how that feels. 
 Mm.

 [Chuckles] Usually I insist.

 You are so studly in doctor mode, wielding that clipboard... 
 You're into clipboard-wielding? 
 On the right guy... No joke. 
 How's your weekend look? Am I gonna see you? 
 Oh, I wish. 
 I have to spend the weekend with Barbara. 
 The one who hates you. 
 I believe we are at "grudgingly tolerates" now, but, yes, we will be representing SheShe at Splitcon 2016... 
 A convention for the divorced and "split curious." 
 Is that a thing? 
 Yep, and now I am the keynote speaker, and we have our own booth. 
 That's almost clipboard sexy.

 Ah... 
 Maybe people bond faster under stress.

 Is that rushing Becca to the hospital or meeting my parents? 
 They're nosy, by the way. 
 They want to know what we call each other. 
 Harris and Abby?

 I forgot to tell Walt where the B6 was. 
 Who's Walt? 
 My brother and his husband's "Manny." 
 He's helping out while Becca... 
 She just moved into the guesthouse. 
 Your ex's ex? 
 Yeah, she's on bed rest. 
 She can't keep anything down, and her boyfriend's off shooting a movie, and with Jake gone and all this, it's too much. 
 I don't know how people do it without a "Manny."

 Abby McCarthy... Our star attraction. 
 So excited to meet you.

 Oh, hi. Nice to meet you. 
 This is Barbara. 
 Sawyer from SheShe! Love it. 
 Ah, everyone is so thrilled about your keynote tomorrow afternoon. 
 Me too. 
 Well, the SheShe booth is right over here. 
 Look at that. Yeah. 
 I'll stop by tomorrow, Abby, to grab you before your speech.

 So, if we couldn't fool around at work... 
 Ah, ah, unacceptable. 
 Don't even say it. 
 Oh, which reminds me... 
 Mm-hmm? 
 Sherry demanded a family trip to the lake. 
 I have to leave after work. I'll be back on Sunday.

 Well, I can put off going until tomorrow afternoon, if you're open in the morning. 
 Ugh. No, we'll just have to go without. 
 Come on. 
 Now, what's so important? 
 You can make up an excuse if I can. 
 Gordon's mother is in town, and tomorrow Phoebe's doing this thing at her house where we pick pre-reception cocktails. 
 I don't know. The rituals just never end. 
 Stop. Okay, so... 
 Why don't you let your friends pick? 
 What do you care? 
 You're gonna be backstage getting trussed or whatever. 
 No, I cannot cancel on my almost mother-in-law. 
 Okay, fine. 
 Then I'm just gonna have to make up for what I'm gonna be missing.

 Now... 
 Oh, okay.

 Yeah? 
 Can you just suddenly grow a mole? 
 Can they just, like, sprout up suddenly overnight?

 Oh... [Giggles] 
 Doesn't it look good in pink? 
 Uh, anyway, so, uh, here's the deal. 
 Uh, Charlene really wants... 
 Badly wants to pitch in around here. 
 So she asked me if I could make her a, managing member of the LLC. 
 What? 
 You're not serious. 
 Well, I just have all these great ideas I'm itching to share with you. 
 And since I'm half owner and I can't be here all the time, it makes sense, huh? 
 [Giggles] 
 Oh, look at that. 
 Can I have a word? 
 I've had a really rough couple of days. 
 Can you not do this to me right now, please? 
 I'm not doing anything to you. 
 Look, it's only a thing until we figure out the communal property. 
 That's not the point.

 I truly see potential for you, in the art world. 
 Can I redirect your attention to this puddle of sadness I just created?

 You could consult. 
 And, of course, given your background, fine-art modeling is always an option.

 My girlfriend's getting married, and I'm hosting this... 
 Phoebe, for the chance to combine your beauty with my voice, we'll take any time you can give. 
 Okay. 
 Grab her some props so she can find the character.

 But you made being single look so good... 
 Like with Dr. Harris. 
 Thank you, but, I mean, it's just sad.

 It's... exquisite. 
 So, if you do the drawing, then what does Joaquin do? 
 Oh, he'll take this and do the rest in Photoshop... 
 Uh, edit, add filters, move things around. 
 Is that normal? 
 Joaquin... he's an artist in the tradition of Warhol and Kostabi. 
 He has a singular vision, and part of that is outsourcing execution.

 We're not married to it. 
 You don't like it, forget about it, because you're gonna love this. 
 Huh? 
 Uh, I did not say that either. 
 Mm, actually, you did in that piece about dating apps. 
 I was being ironic. 
 I brought you a little gift from, Santa's workshop. 
 [Laughing] 
 You see, consumers can customize their own by uploading a photo of their ex... 
 I don't want to throw darts at Jake's face. 
 You said you wanted to kill him in a video that got, like, six million views. 
 I did. 
 And, um, I'm sorry. 
 I'm not interested in any of this. 
 All right.

 You're still here. 
 Hi, um... 
 You look, uh... 
 Again... 
 You working? 
 Yeah, after the preview, we have to finish a lot of art and hang it, at... 
 Um, downtown... 
 The gallery? 
 Yes. 
 Well, do you want to take a break and join the party? 
 [Sighs] No. 
 And Joaquin wouldn't allow it, anyway. 
 Why? 
 You make the art too. 
 Joaquin believes people don't want to know how the sausage is made. 
 Oh, well, that's convenient for him, seeing that the main ingredient seems to be you. 
 It really is not that unusual. 
 But it is that annoying. 
 Is the whole art world this... 
 Terrible? 
 Yes. 
 No, not at all. 
 But the people... 
 Are buyers. 
 One of them has his Picasso displayed with a black light. 
 "Brings out the colors." 
 Another one has his Basquiat hung upside down. 
 [Gasps] No. 
 That's what happens when stupidity and money collide.

 Oh, come on! 
 Lover boy here is a psychopath! 
 He's obsessed with Charlene! 
 Hey, hey, hey! Come on! That's bullshit! 
 Why the hell is she at home right now crying her eyes out? 
 Because, Robert, she's out of her flippin' gourd! 
 Just like you, okay? 
 Scott here, he's a train wreck of a delicate flower!

 He likes to screw around with his coworkers. 
 They always consent, always. 
 Enthusiastically. 
 You are so dead! 
 Stand down! 
 I am so sick of this! 
 Did we not love each other once? 
 Yeah, maybe it was co-dependent. 
 Maybe it was toxic, but we did get married, and we shared everything together, including our goddamn money, and here we are. 
 You're the one who wants to make this into a fight! 
 Am I? 
 When you didn't even have the decency to leave? 
 You had to have a secret life to run away to. 
 Who knows if any of it was real? 
 You took everything away from us, including our goddamn memories. 
 And here I am, trying to get my life back together, and you two waltz in here trying to take the one thing away from me that you haven't sh1t on already. 
 Do you hate me that much? 
 Oh, Jo, no. 
 No, I don't hate... I never... 
 What do you expect me to do? 
 Have some empathy. 
 I do. 
 I do, Jo. 
 But I'm with Charlene now. 
 And the lawyers haven't decided who this place belongs to. 
 Until they do... 
 This place is mine. 
 Charlene wants to bang a baker, she can do it at Le Pain. 
 That's low. 
 Get out. 
 That's low, even for you.

 She sat for me yesterday for the new series. 
 She usually models for French "Vogue," but... 
 "Italian," and, technically, I sat for JD. 
 You know, the work felt a bit satirical at first, but now I'm beginning to see it as something like a... 
 A cry from the bowels of the machine itself.

 Wow. 
 So Phoebe's piece... Is it spoken for yet? 
 Not yet, but I think it's gonna be one of the standouts.

 You know what? You're right. I used you. 
 And you used me, and now I'm gone. 
 You don't even realize what I can teach you. 
 No, you taught me that I need to stop confusing big words and bad denim for life experiences, so thank you.

 So he's not big on commitment? 
 Not so much, at least not yet. 
 Well, it really hasn't been that long.

 Pretty sure I scared 'em off for good. 
 Huh. 
 You're not gonna give me any credit? 
 For what? 
 Yesterday, she was all over me. 
 At first, I rebuffed her advances, because I just knew that she was trying to turn me against you. 
 So, I declined, telling her that my allegiance was with my dear Jo. 
 Is this the "Game of Thrones"? 
 Less rape-y. 
 Mm. 
 So, after we closed, I may or may not have let slip that you were annoying me and that if Charlene and I joined forces, we could throw you out of the bakery. 
 I also may or may not have suggested that we consummate our relationship with some snogging. 
 You set her up. 
 Are you trying to say you did that for me? 
 Perhaps. 
 Maybe. 
 I could tell you had a lot on your plate. 
 I always say that I don't think of my marriage as a failure, even though it ended. 
 But the truth is, a part of me does think we failed. 
 And I have a confession to make. 
 It has been, so hard letting go of our family and each other that, uh... 
 Jake and I tried to reconcile while I was working here. 
 It was brief, very. 
 And if there was a moment... 
 [Voice breaking] That we could have saved us, we missed it. 
 Okay, this is sad. I don't like it. 
 It is, and I don't put any of this into my column, because, you know, "happy face."
