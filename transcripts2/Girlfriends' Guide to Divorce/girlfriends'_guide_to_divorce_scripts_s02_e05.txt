 Previously on "Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce"... 
 Open up your mouth, and the hypocrisy just flows out. 
 I'm sick of being told that I don't know my own mind. 
 I'm not gonna be a professional wife. 
 Are you watching p0rn? 
 You crossed the line, Frumpkis! 
 Frumpkis and Charlene booked Zoey's flight first class. 
 She is a monster. 
 I'm going to Latvia for four months. 
 Right. 
 Is everything okay? 
 I have to head back to the office. 
 Hey, what happened to dinner? 
 I had to leave before I completely lost it. 
 Gorgeous. 
 This girl. Jowls. 
 I'm not kidding. 
 She looked real. 
 I appreciate your opinion, Phoebe. 
 Oh, wait. I don't. 
 You want to be the new face of divorce? 
 Knock yourself out. 
 If you want to do a follow-up piece, don't you need a follow-up date? 
 You have to go find solace in other men! 
 No functional adult would have knocked up his 26-year-old actress rebound. 
 Oh, my God. I pulled out. 
 You pulled out? 
 Yes! 
 And we just can't fix it. 
 I think my heart is breaking. 
 We are just these people together. 
 Abby, that is so sad. 
 I cannot believe you are going through all that with Jake. 
 Yeah, what's going on with the CW baby? 
 You and Jake telling the kids? 
 Um, we're talking about it. 
 I, uh... and I'm really sorry I didn't tell all you guys what was going on. I was just such a mess. 
 No. 
 Yeah. 
 But I'm through it now. 
 I am through the storm, so... 
 You just, uh... You seem a little, um... 
 Intense. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 Like you're sweating bullets. 
 No, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 Well, you know, you're signing the papers. 
 It's a biggie, I mean, you can let yourself feel it. 
 Yeah. I do, and I will. 
 I do. I just... right now, I'm stressed about work. 
 More drama with your boss? 
 She's not my boss. 
 She's my editor, technically, Oh! and, yeah, you know, Yeah okay. it's not so great for job stability when she hates me and everything I stand for, so, you know, I have no idea if I'm killing it or if I'm about to be fired. 
 Oh, no, you're not. It just takes time. 
 Yeah. 
 You just got there. 
 She's gonna love you. Just win her over. 
 She's not very winnable, but that's okay. 
 I'm just throwing myself into it. 
 You know, the SheShe beast must be fed. 
 Ooh, fed with more sexy doctor dates. 
 Actually, I do have one tonight with Dr. Harris. 
 Oh. 
 It is strictly professional, ladies. 
 Isn't that perfect? You get to have a date with an even hotter version of Dr. Drew while I get to see my fat dickwad of an ex. 
 What? Frumpkis? When? 
 He's flying in tonight on business. 
 Well, he says it's business, but he probably just wants a break from Charlene and her inbred Kentucky lifestyle. 
 Okay, remember what we talked about, doll. 
 We're still mid-negotiations. - Mm-hmm. 
 Do not provoke him. 
 I know. 
 You know what my divorce feels like? 
 It feels like this roach under the fridge that won't die. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. 
 That's why God invented prenups. 
 Me and Gordon are going over ours with an estate lawyer today. 
 Oh, my God. Delia Banai's prenup? 
 That is going to be... 
 Terrifying. 
 It's gonna be simple, standard, and civilized. 
 It's gonna be very low-key and cool, which should be your mantra with Frumpkis. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Cool. 
 It is, trust me. 
 My kid is all I'm worried about, okay? 
 I don't want to get sucked into that asshole bigamist's... whoa, what is this? 
 It's my new car. 
 Whoo! 
 It is a Mirai. It runs on hydrogen. 
 Phoebe godmother saving the world. 
 Can I come to the future with you? 
 Well, Jo, you might have to make peace with your past first. 
 [Laughing] 
 Ah. All right. 
 All right, I'll see you at Abby's. 
 See you in a few minutes. 
 See you soon. Drive safe.

 I'm so sorry about the whole Frumpkis coming and, you know, us being so disconnected since... 
 Since you booted me out? 
 Abs, I told you. We're fine now. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Kind of. 
 So, ladies? 
 All : Mm-hmm? 
 I have some news. 
 Guess who passed her GED. 
 [Gasps] Oh, my God. 
 Phoebe, that's amazing. 
 I didn't even know you were taking your GED. 
 Oh, well, you're not the only one with a secret double life, Abby McCarthy. 
 Oh, my God. What brought this on? 
 I don't know, not finishing high school? 
 And if I want career prospects that don't involve smiling pretty for a camera, I needed a high school diploma, so I worked my ass off, went for it, voilà. 
 But why so secretive? 
 Because if I didn't pass, it would be humiliating. 
 But you did, which is fantastic. 
 We have to celebrate. 
 Oh, it's just a little test. 
 We should throw a party. 
 She should have a prom. 
 Yes. 
 She's a graduate. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I never had a prom. 
 With a limo? 
 Oh, get SheShe to pay for it. 
 You could spin it into some kind of glamspirational bullshit piece. 
 I would be happy to write about something other than my dating life, but what do you think, Phoebe? 
 If I can inspire women to graduate high school and get a free open bar, why not? 
 It's a SheShe win-win, right? 
 To Phoebe! A SheShe win-win. 
 All : SheShe win-win.

 You been busy, huh?

 That means you twittered and, you know, date with Dr. Harris. 
 And that is for work.

 Did you talk to your mom yet?

 Yeah, just go see if your brother's almost ready.

 You on a nationwide search for a third family? 
 Mom. 
 It's good to see L.A. hasn't softened your edge, Jo. 
 Oh, no, it hasn't. 
 No, look, I just wanted to pop in and say hi. 
 Uh-huh. Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I'm on my way to some investor meetings. 
 You know, they shouldn't take too long. 
 Maybe you and I could sit down while I'm here, catch up. 
 Yeah, maybe you're high. Yeah, no. That's not gonna happen, but the kid's excited to see you and spend some time with you. 
 Yeah, Dad, there's this emerging artists exhibit at the Annenberg.

 What the hell was that? 
 That's Charlene. 
 She's got him doing yoga, tennis, eating salad. 
 Salad? 
 Yeah. 
 You don't make friends with salad. 
 Dad's changed. He really has. 
 And then maybe we could decorate the place with some fun prom themes like "Under the Sea". 
 "Under the Sea"? I never got that. 
 What high school senior dreams about being a merman? 
 [Laughs] Totally. 
 I love mermen. 
 Okay, well, how about, um, "Year of the Dragon"? 
 That was the theme of my prom if I had finished senior year. 
 Okay, that's hot. 
 That, I'm feeling. 
 Awesome. 
 Oh, and Abby and I discussed having a "rock your decade" dress code, like, when you went to prom, '80s, '90s. 
 Yes, and I already have the cutest '80s ensemble picked out. 
 It is day-glo sequins with big puffed sleeves... 
 I'm gonna go full Cyndi Lauper with a bit of Sheena Easton with some pink, frosty lip gloss. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I love Sheena Easton. 
 She's my fave. Hit me, girl. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Okay, let's talk prom dates. 
 Ooh, no, I just ended things with this guy, Marco. 
 He was black. 
 I just said that because you're black. 
 I'm so sorry. Is that awful? 
 Okay, it's hilarious 'cause you're a riot. 
 Oh. 
 People do it all the time. 
 They're like, "did y'all go to preschool together? 
 'Cause he's black too." 
 No. 
 It's fine. All right. Want me to find you a date? 
 No. This is my fantasy prom. 
 I want it to be all about girls going stag, hitting the dance floor, no mermen. 
 That's what I was going to write about, not mermen. 
 You know, this is Phoebe's story. 
 It's about reconciling her present with her past. 
 I... 
 Love that.

 No, honey, no, you're not stepping on my toes, and besides, my toes are tough. 
 They're like little rocks. 
 Okay, great. 
 I don't know. 
 I just wrote that one piece for the school newsletter, and now I'm writing for SheShe? 
 Well, you know, you don't have to write it if you don't feel comfortable. 
 It's completely understandable. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I thought Barbara seemed pretty sold on the idea. 
 Barbara's not exactly my number one fan, so... 
 Oh, so you think she only offered me the column just to piss you off. 
 Oh, I... no. 
 I mean, of course not that, but I just... you just don't have to feel any pressure, right, to write anything. 
 This is your prom. 
 If I write it, you get to just enjoy it. 
 All right, let's stick to the game plan. 
 Great. 
 Unless you really want to No. 
 Okay. 
 I mean, yes, you write it. 
 Okay. You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Looks like we are all in line with the basics. 
 You would each leave the marriage with what you had upon entering into it. 
 Per the lady's demands. 
 Luckily, I'm not leaving. 
 Me neither. 
 Let's go over child custody. 
 No, that won't be necessary. 
 We're just gonna go with the standard terms. 
 Fine, let's move on to child support payments. 
 The same, standard. 
 All right, but you do need to appoint child guardians in the case of both of your deaths. 
 Fine, do you want to just go with your mother? 
 I don't have any viable options in mine, so... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Have you two not discussed any of this stuff yet? 
 Oh, it's been mentioned.
