 In the spirit of radical honesty, I am dedicated to truth from here on in. 
 Becca is pregnant. 
 I try to fix everybody else's stuff cause I don't have the first clue to fix my own. 
 These belong Zooey. 
 She's gonna visit Frumpkis and the Wicked Witch of the South. 
 I'm going to hate being with Dad and the fat head. 
 How do you know Dr. Harris? 
 He's like an Oprah doctor. 
 Today, I find out  that he knocked up his ex-girlfriend. 
 Good, I'm glad he finally manned up and told you. 
 How long have you known Becca was pregnant? 
 About a month. 
 That is a huge omission. 
 Okay fine, it's my fault. 
 It kind of is.

 So... 
 Right? 
 Yeah. 
 Right. 
 [tape rewinding] 
 Lilly, will you please go get your brother? 
 You're late. 
 Charlie, we're late! 
 _ 
 That's not what I asked you to do. 
 Can you please go upstairs and get him? 
 Hi, sweetie. 
 Hi. 
 Hello. 
 I should've told you about Becca as soon as I knew. 
 I am so sorry. 
 It's just old Jake. 
 Bad Jake. 
 Not bad. 
 No bad. 
 A little bit. 
 Could just... 
 If I said some horrible things too and... I was upset, I could be very cunning. 
 No, no, I'm apologizing. 
 I am sorry. 
 I was wrong. 
 And you accepted my apology and let's not... 
 Spend an hour revisiting all the awful things we said to each other. 
 Yeah, that. Let's not do that one. 
 We could make out instead. 
 That I like. 
 Mama, mama, mama, mama! 
 Wow! Oh, my God, Charlie, slow down! 
 My butt is so itchy. 
 Hi, dad! 
 Hi, itchy butt. 
 Go to the car please, I'll be right out. 
 What about my butt? 
 We'll get to it. 
 Hurry!  
 Nobody cares about your butt. 
 Um, hey, I was thinking, before Latvia, maybe we should go up to that place in Ojai for a weekend. 
 We can't fix this in a weekend. 
 No, of course we can't, but look, I'm going to Latvia for four months. 
 You we're gonna be going on glam dates and writing a book about divorce. 
 The clock is ticking here, Abby. 
 Even if I wanted to I have to work and you're prepping. 
 Always gonna be something though, no! 
 Okay, okay. I want to go away with you. 
 How about we hole up at home? 
 No kids. All weekend. 
 Oh. 
 Why does that seem naughty to me? 
 Because how many hours do you think we get to spend in this house without kids. 
 I think zero, zero hours. 
 None hours.  
 None hours. 
 Great! 
 And then we could, you know... 
 On the couch, in the pool, Oh. in the garage and... 
 Garage? 
 Are you into that? 
 Not the garage, I'm just riffing on that idea. 
 You know what we do? 
 We send the kids with Ford and Lilly can help him get the cousins. 
 And no phones...  
 Yeah. 
 Cause if something goes on with the kids, Ford can use the landline. 
 It's old school, it's analog. 
 I like it. 
 Analog! 
 Good. 
 Oh, got to take the kids. 
 Quickie in the garage? 
 No.  
 Kidding. 
 [laughs]  
 Okay. 
 Okay.  
 Tonight? 
 Tonight! 
 I'm so excited. 
 Can't wait, I love you. 
 [whispers] I love you. 
 [upbeat music] 
 Oh no, no, no, this is cute. 
 Right? 
 This is really, really cute here. 
 Oh, my gosh, hi! 
 Hello. 
 Marria, this is Delia, my former divorce attorney and current good friend. 
 Hello, nice to meet you.  
 Hello. 
 This is Marria, we were models and were roommates in Milan. 
 I thought I recognized your face. 
 Beauty. 
 I know, she actually kept working and got really good gigs. 
 For a minute. 
 Now, I'm lucky if I book the mom in a J. Crew catalog because I'm like, [whispers] 33. 
 Shh. 
 [all laughs] 
 But that's why the Blue Robin campaign is so empowering. 
 You have to do this with me, Phoebe. 
 I got a call today, along with the beauty here, to maybe be in this year's all-natural gal campaign. 
 The all -natural woman at any age ads? 
 That's enormous! 
 Right? 
 So powerful, it's positive, raw, real, and makeup, no Photoshop. 
 Terrifying. 
 Come on, you look amazing. 
 I don't know. 
 My modeling years were not the best memories. 
 And these are test shots, right? 
 So only one of us actually gets the job. 
 Come on, it'll be fun. 
 I'm with Marria, give it a shot. 
 Anyway I got to run, I'm going house hunting with Gordon Oh, that's fun. 
 Enough of this wedding B.S. 
 Let's just, get on the real life, right? 
 Do it. 
 We on for dinner? 
 Oh yeah, you bet your fine ass we are. 
 Nice to meet you. Later. 
 Nice to meet you too. 
 So is the food good at least? 
 Deep-fried NASCAR pickles or whatever. I can't wait to come home tomorrow. Charlene is the worst. I hate her. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry to hear that. How's the paradise place? It's great! It's like we work for IBM in the '80s. Ew. Kidding. It's fun. Ping-pong and a swimming pool, It's like the Paradiso ghetto. I thought you hate Uncle Jake. No it's good to keep your enemies where you can see them, my little southern belle. Well, I can see mine perfectly. Ugh. Hang in there, okay? You're almost home. I love you. [upbeat music] And here's your perfect kitchen. Don't look at me, sweetie. It's perfect for my chef. Oh yes. of course. Nice, nice home office for you. Do we like? We love. Now, this is the 19th century configuration of bedroom for each. Each what? Person. Oh. Huh, I didn't know that was a thing. Oh, yes. It's become popular lately. "Downton Abbey" style. But a lot of folks prefer the single. No, I... I kind of love it. I love the idea. It's very regal. You love separate bedrooms, really? Insomniac. Teeth grinder, duvet hogger. Oh, what about warts and all? I don't know, it just seems kind of romantic. Or the opposite of romantic? It's nice to have the option, right? I think the bidets are African ivory. Maybe before poaching was illegal of course. Feel like now, come see. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ Honey? Cat! Closer. Warmer. Warmer. Holy sh1t. Last one naked gets to do whatever the other one wants. That's a win -win. I know. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ *** Definitely. [giggles] Radical honesty. Oh, no. What? I would like my husband slash ex-husband to make me a drink. [chuckles] Oh, yeah? Yeah. Honesty. That's right. Love it! You know seriously, I love the conversation we had this morning. Yeah, me too. We apologized, we moved on, and... We didn't rehash every argument we've had for the last 20 years. Exactly. Radical honesty, and then we let it go. Let it go. Enough! Don't sing that song. Fine. You get my point? I do. Oh, what's in this? Good stuff. Radical honesty. Cheers. So we're you in love with Nate? What? Okay, I'm letting it go. Most of it. But, you know, you told me about the Will thing, and that somehow got me back to Nate and were you in love with Nate. Okay. No, I was not in love with Nate. It was not about that. I think I just needed someone to tell me I'm beautiful and funny, smart. I needed somebody to give me cookies. Some ego cookies. I wasn't giving out many of those. I'm sorry. Yeah, well, I do demand a lot of cookies. Indeed you do. When I was little, I cookie-starved myself... Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. Mmm.  I just think as time goes by eventually it's like you can't see each other. Not the way other people do. Mm -hmm. Well, I see you now. What? [laughs] Yeah in fact, I would like... Oh! [laughs]  To see you lay all over... Oh, my God! Our dining room table. Whoa! [moaning] We're gonna about 30 seconds before you get all Hazmat-y and have to clean this table up. You have always underestimated my tolerance for disorder. Oh, I have? Yeah. So like if I... If I just dropped this egg on the floor, that'd be cool, you wouldn't have to clean it up right away? It would be wasteful, but... I wouldn't... And one, two... You are so gonna get it. Three.  First of all, you left the refrigerator door open. Here we go, four. That is a wild waste of energy. Six, seven... Damn [laughs] Not cleaning that up, baby. You are so dead. ♪ But it's true ♪

He never had a problem with it before. What if he's that doubting the whole things? No, did he demand separate bedrooms? Was he trying to start a fight? No, he said like it's nice to have the option or something. That's not cold feet, and I kind of get his point. What? Binge Netflix, fart with abandon, get your alone time. It really took me by surprise. No, I'm good. I have a photo shoot tomorrow. You're kidding. No. Oh, my... I could've sworn that you were letting Marria down gently. This is probably going to be the last chance I get to do this again. And you know after Marco, I'm kind of grateful to do something that might send some good energy into to the universe. Mm, here's to sending some good energy. Good energy. [sports announcer shouting on TV] [crowd cheering] Mmm. Mm -hmm. Good morning Mrs. Clean. Mm-hmm. Good morning. Really, the sports already? Really with the scrubbing already? [laughs] I really don't want to watch. Oh, come on. Come watch it with me. You've never given it the time of day. You know that Phil Jackson used to have his players practice without the ball. Oh, my God. No, no, cause it's about five people... You sound like... Thinking with one mind. A pretentious guy, who's about to direct a film with Joseph Gordon Levitt. Oh, wait! Oh, come on. I'm serious. It's... you danced in college. Yeah. It's... come here. I'll show you. No, I am hungover and I need food and water. Uh -huh, you need this. This is the ball, right? You can't let me get it, right? Cause here I can get it, but here I can't get it. You got to use your butt. My butt?  Yeah you got to like dance. I will be away from... no. Keep it... let's see look, I get it. Oh, God! Ow! That didn't hurt. Now there's pretzels everywhere. I know that OCD carb nightmare! All right, grow up! Oh, grow down! Grow down, Abby. I don't want to be tickled. Grow down, grow down, grow down. No really, stop. I don't want to be tickled. Stop! Oh, God! Jesus. Hit me in the face. Sorry. You just like relax for a minute. You're provoking me. I'm not provoking you. You clean the entire house and we talk about not cleaning the house. No, mm-mmm. No. No? And what is it Jake and Abby's greatest hits argument number seven? The cleaning argument? I don't want to have it, do you? Skip it, right? Let it go. I'm just... I'm gonna let it go. I think we're either gonna save our marriage or we're gonna end up in a mental institution together. Same difference. [rock music] Good morning. Hi.  Hi. Gordon texted. He's just running a bit late. No problem. It's probably brunch traffic. Is that a thing? I don't know. Anyways, no real time crunch here since we're only seeing the two houses. Oh, two. I thought that we were seeing four. Well, the ones on Roscomare and Samara have single master bedrooms and Mr. Beech's email it said just the two master bedroom configurations from now on. Oh right, no, I thought the others... I think they're singles. And here's Mr. Beech! I think I have the door code. Mm -hmm. You and Courtney have, uh, separate bedrooms? Uh, good morning to you too. We can take separate vacations. Come on. I just think the option is intriguing... The option to not sleep beside me. Okay, Chateau Du Beech et Banai awaits! Delia, love of my life, we are just exploring this thing. Exploring? You told Cyan. Shawn.  Whatever his name is. The only one to see places with two masters, that's not exploring. That's deciding for both of us. Cyan, there better be two of everything. Two offices, two kitchens. So I take her through the whole thing, and afterwards Lilly thinks about it for a second, and then she says, "Mom, I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna "have s*x until college, but when I do, I promise I will call you as soon as it's over." Aww. Our little girl. I know. And Charlie... Oh, Charlie's gonna lose his virginity at 13. [laughs] Or 30. And guys he got going either way for him. Agreed, I totally get that. Ah, as a radical honesty... Go for it. When I think about the CW, baby. I just feel ripped off. I feel like we did the baby thing already. It was hard, I don't want to do it again. Yeah. Well radical honesty... You probably should've come on her tits. Right? Right. Like the CW baby is happening and we can bitch about it or we can embrace it. But if we're at our best, we can handle it. I mean, we can thrive even. Amazing. Thank you. [doorbell rings] [giggles] Oh, my baby! I missed you! Oh, I missed you too, but I can't breathe. Mmm. The latest delectable creations from Scott. Game changers. Not vegan. Oh, exciting. Mm-hmm.  Thank you. Okay now, dish it. How bad is it? Honestly, I don't think I have the language skills. I don't think James Joyce had the language skills. Really? Mom, well, I'm fully aware of the self-sabotaging nature of woman on woman ridicule. Mm-hmm.  I must say this, she is a monster. I caught the monster part go on. She's dumb, she's mean, she's ignorant... Oh, whoa, whoa, mean how? Mean to you? Do I need to cut a bitch? The bitch was metaphorically cut. She even retreated to her parlor. I'm so proud of you. Please don't get into it with Dad on this, okay? Mm -mm, no. Oh, munchkin, come here. I'm gonna wash up and unpack. Come keep me company? Nothing would make me happier. I'll be right in. [giggles] _ "Retreated to her parlor," huh. Zooey's back. _ [cell phone buzzes] [electronic music] [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ Can I just say, I had your June of '98 "Vogue" cover in my locker all of 7th grade. Oh, my God, that's cool, thanks. Hey, can you help out a second? Yeah. Thanks, Phoebe. Carson.  Mm-hmm? This girl, jowls, I'm not kidding. Can you tape them, try to put a jaw line on her, okay? Okay.  Kind of in a hurry. Thanks. Tape them? What happened to all-natural? 
 
 Jonas? Hey, I didn't know you we're gonna be here. Phoebes, hey, honey.  Hi. Sorry, I couldn't sleep last night. You can work some magic, right? I'm so puffy. No, stop it you're fine. Just breathe. Okay. I'm great. I didn't even want to think what year it was. The last time the three of us were in the same room together. I'm sorry, out of time, come on. Almost done. Sorry, I'm good, I'm good. I could do it, I could do it. It's gonna be fine, Marria. You won't regret this, I promise. I'm gonna be fine. Yeah. What does that mean? "You won't regret this." Oh, Alicia and I, the producer, we're super tight. And she called me about this and we started talking about what other girls might be good, and I totally pushed for you two. You didn't tell me that. Well you're glad you're here, right? Yeah. How is Jonas? Alcoholic. She's been sober for a few months. Just trying to throw her a bone. You should have seen her before I worked on her. I did see on the Twitter that you're fake date with the real doctor was a disaster. Well, I did cry over you. If you must know. Sad, but what an awesome story. Go on. [giggles] How much longer do you have to do that kind of stuff. It's kind of bad for my ego cookies. I don't know. I do know it's hard. Thank you. But I mean... Soon you have to advocate your role as the face of the divorce industrial complex, right? Not necessarily. I am writing a book. Oh, I know. My parents read the press release. "I mean, your marriage failed. Do you have to announce it to the world?" Ugh, that's a good alternate title for the book. [laughs] Sure your parents are glad that you finally ditched the dead beat husband, right? I'm sorry. Jesus. They never gave you a real chance. And the truth is they have barely mentioned our split at all. Oh yeah, it's not about them. Why would they? Don't be mean. I'm not being mean, I'm being realistic. I mean, you and Max are their props. They want the image of the perfectly happy family until something gets messy then... whoosh! They're ghosts! They're gone! That is not true. They raised us to be independent... Come on, they raised you to raise yourself. I mean, my mom may call three times a day, Yeah, that does not mean... But she would anything for me. That she...  That means she's a parent! No! No. This is Jake and Abby, greatest hits number 19. You are 19 with a bullet in rising. Could we just? Move on.  Please. Moving on!  That number 19 is gone. I'm throwing it out. I don't even know what you're talking about. What are you talking about? Yeah. Ah! Okay. I feel tense, do you feel tense? Yeah, I feel a little tense.  Yeah. But I still feel like we're doing the right thing. You know, we're not going down old roads. No, no, yeah, definitely. Dead-ends. Definitely. Right? Less talk more action.  Yes! We should...  We could... make hot cocoa. Play a game of Hearts. Not exactly action... [laughs] If you want to go the mellow route, we could like binge watch "House of Cards." I've plowed through it already. Okay. Sorry. We were separated. Yeah. I mean, we could just take a bunch of ecstasy, find the old dance mixes and party all night. Oh, do you have molly? Molly... isn't that the new code of ecstasy? And? No, I don't have any. Aww, sounds amazing. You know there is this guy at the the Paradiso who says anytime I want, he'd be back in like 40 minutes. Hurry up. [laughs] Kiss me first. Oh, my God. [laughs] All right, um, I'll text you when I get it. Okay, I'll find Charlie's glow sticks. Whoo! Zing, zing, zing, zing, zing, zing. [giggles] Novak, what? I need a quick favor. Is this a home invasion? Uh, no. Fine, if you could show me how to forward a text message. Okay, I'm looking for that guy. I think he lives in 3F... Stanny? Oh... it's pronounced "Staani". Stanni. Like Yanni.  Uh-huh. He's in jail. Oh, sh1t.  Yeah. Bummer. Forward texting, how? You just... Press it then you press contact. Uh-huh.  See? Is this Zooey's phone? Yeah. She tells me she hate Charlene, right? I check the phone, and they've been texting each other back and forth with, "I miss you," "I miss you too," "I can't wait to come back." [scoffs] It's horrible, right? Okay, you are, one, spying on your daughter. And two, you're pissed that she's not miserable when she's with her father. She's lying to me. Well gosh, I wonder how you would've reacted had she told you the truth. That would have gone great for her. Why are you in my apartment again? Do you have any ecstasy, extra molly? [laughs] Oh, my God. You two are hilarious. What do you mean "you two?" What does that mean? Oh, I know all about it, lover boy! You don't know anything. Let's see here. No ecstasy because I'm not 15. Okay. Now we've got... oh. Two Ambien, couple Zoloft, a Lipitor, and... Oh, what do you know. A Viagra-Frumpkis I found in my shoe. I'll take it all. Took the Viagra, thank you. Mm -hmm. Why just give it to me? Don't give me a look. Can I have a baggy or something please? So how's my... Highly one friend doing?

Your loser monkey husband is getting something done. You know what? I have been nothing but supportive, even you have admitted that. I got retroactive diamonds... When, when?  Because of how supportive... Yeah, well that was love goggles, because you are not supportive and you remind me on a daily basis how much more functional and reasonable you are than me. Because I am.

All right go up, go clean up. All right, let's get in the works. Uh, where's Jonas? I don't know, In-N-Out Burger? I think she's drinking again. So sad and so bloated. She had like this panic attack in makeup and it was just really sad. Uh, no, I think she was nervous and she wasn't drunk. And that definitely wasn't a panic attack. Whatever, she let herself go. Let's get to work! She looked real. Like a real woman without tape. I appreciate your opinion, Phoebe. Oh wait, I don't. Please, just go to makeup. Bloated, Marria? Really? Look, Phoebes. I know how this goes. They test a couple of girls. You don't know how it's gonna work out. Portfolios lie. Alicia asked me who I liked from the old days, so I stacked the deck a little.

Yeah, cutthroat doesn't even begin to describe that world. And now that I'm ancient, it's a lot worse. I know. By the way, when they say, "No Photoshop and no makeup," what they mean is they tape and they moisturize the crap out of you and then hit you with the supernova of fill light. I knew it. Wow. Think I need to find something that makes me feel good about myself for the right reason. Right on, lady, I get it. What will that be? That is the question. I don't know.
