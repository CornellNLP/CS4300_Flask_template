 Previously on "Girlfriend's Guide to Divorce" 
 I believed it all when I wrote it... but now I think "What a pile of horse sh1t". 
 I know you guys are getting a divorce! 
 We're not getting a divorce! 
 Abby! Yes we are. 
 I'm going to give you the "younger man" experience. 
 Ralph saw them at the chateau with the CW actors, they were getting a room. 
 Jo! I thought you were comin' tonight? 
 No, I decided not to lose the day. 
 She's opening another vegan bakery. 
 Cat has been my editor for 15 years. 
 And she sends you hugs and kisses. 
 (Delia) I'm sleeping with my client. 
 I could get into serious trouble, I was 14, and Kori fed me pills and drinks to loosen me up. We are signing this week. Let's drive down to Baja. I'm not over you, and you're not over me either. Everybody knows it! Enough! Stop! We are getting a divorce. Case closed. My husband is a polygamist Colonel Sanders living in Kentucky with his equestrian wife. I just need to see what he left us for. What? Kori is pressing civil charges. How does it feel to be almost Mrs. Delia Beech? Ultimately, it's you, it's the one you love, and a gamble. So I was late. I'm having your baby. Hey. Hey. ♪ Don't tell me no, just tell me yes ♪ Abby McCarthy! I bow down to you. Well, yes, you do. I thought Cat was gonna... I'm Katherine Miller. My friends call me Kat but with a K. [chuckles] I'm Cat's boss. Katherine? Yes. Oh, my God, hi. Thank you for taking the time. Well, I don't, usually. But Cat's having a little... messy kind of personal issue... meth. Meth? Oh, my God. No, no, no, no worries. She's been at the Betty White Center. She's doing fine. Betty Ford? Oh, yeah, she looks 15 years younger. I'm thinking, "Whoa." Botox got nothing on recovery. Well, thank you so much for meeting me. Oh, no, of course. Oh, wait, Joss? Joss Whedon. Joss Whedon. Joss Whedon. Meet Abby. Abby, Joss. Hey, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Joss wrote "Star Wars." No. No, he didn't. I did write "Hamilton" though. Broadway. That's it, "Hamilton." I'm sorry. That's it. He did. You did not. No, I could have. Well, I am a fan of the work you actually do. Thank you, yours too. Well... I'm familiar, which you're not so much with my work at all. I know you're a very big deal with the nerds. [laughter] Yeah. It was really nice to meet you. Get out while you can. Good luck with "Star Wars." I hear it's gonna be really huge. Knock wood. May the force be with you. What, he hates money? I don't... oh, forget him. Look, let's talk about you. I want to talk about you. Why aren't you divorced yet? That piece is still getting so many hits. This is why SheShe begged me to get you here. The website? They begged? Hmm, hmm, hmm. Helen, Helen... you got to meet her. No, not yet, not yet, not... not... not... Oh, sorry. No, she's someone you need to impress. She's SheShe founder, basically owns the internet. Okay. Okay, you ready? - Mm-hmm. Okay, turn around. Okay, okay. Which one? Black and yellow. Hey, Helen, hi. Hi. Whoo, child! ♪ Baby give me diamonds ♪ 
♪ Give me gold ♪ 
♪ Take the pain away ♪ 
♪ From in my soul ♪ 
♪ Whoo, whoo ♪ [chuckles] ♪ ♪ 
♪ Yeah, ready for the good life ♪

♪ Giving all I got ♪ 
♪ 'Cause seeing the best of me ♪ 
♪ Is not enough ♪ [laughing] Oh, my God. So, who has you all hot and bothered? Oh, Kyle, hi. My... My Hinge guy, you know, being single. So sometimes I Tinder, sometimes I Bumble, sometimes I Happn. It has no E. So, it's official. Everyone's in love with you. SheShe wants you to come in and talk about what you would do if you came on board. I'm... wow, that's... I mean, when? End of the week? [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ Ain't trying to find no trouble ♪ 
♪ But baby, you found it ♪ Hello, beautiful. Hi, how are you? Hi. [sighs] How was the party? Surreal. Sting and his wife want to be my new besties. Do you know this site? SheShe wants to start a new divorce page. Ooh, I love SheShe. Really? Yeah, they're real influencers. Great, I mean, I told them that I knew the site, but I actually just know of the site. It's very GOOP, you know, if GOOP wasn't so... Smug and privileged? Exactly, it covers current affairs, and product reviews, and life hacks for busy gals, you know, like, hacking off your hair... Cut back on morning routine. It's still looking fabulous, by the way. Thank you. Okay, I get it. I'm having a meeting with their editorial team this week, and apparently, I can be the new face of divorce if I nail it. Mm, mm-hmm. Oh, my God, no, you didn't! Yes, we did. Delia, that's huge news. I know. And that is huge. It's crazy. What? What? Delia's getting hitched. Marriage is dead. Delia is getting married? Wow, holy sh1t, that'll be one hell of a prenup, right? [all laughing] Okay, we have to meet Gordon. Now. The girlfriends test? Oh, dear. Don't worry, we'll go easy on him. Proctology report, you know, e-meter, background check. Okay, what made you change your mind? He wants it, and I want him. So who says that marriage has to be one size fits all? We'll make it suit us. Separate houses, limited contact, that is my dream. You look happy. What is it... like, do you know when this is gonna happen? Do you have any idea where? How can we help? No, no, and I don't know, and I'm already bored. What I want to know is where you went off to after the divorce party. Yeah. Oh, don't bother, I tried. Jake and I just talked. More to say to each other? What, with your privates? Oh, my God, privates? We did not talk with our privates. Her v*g1n*. No, I was not talking with... What are... no. That's the worst word. I was not talking with my v*g1n*. Can we please get back to the more important topic at hand, which is Delia's wedding? My two cents is ice sculptures are totally overrated. If you're gonna sculpt, do it in butter. It lasts longer. Where you off to? I got to get back to the bakery. My pastry chef was supposed to be here, but he ended up taking the bus. We have a shop opening here in a week, and the guy gets a fear of flying. I swear, if he wasn't the da Vinci of the vegan Twinkie, I would cut him loose. He is such a whack job. Anyway, congrats. Yeah, whoo! Bye. So Jo's the stable one in that business relationship? I would wait to order the wedding cake. Definitely. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ Oh, no. What? It's career day this week. Uh, yep. Zuma's father made "The Avengers," and Zara's mom is in The Black Eyed Peas. Zara, really? Yeah. "This is my son, Topshop. Topshop, meet Zara." Why aren't you laughing? That was funny. Oh, no, I just got a stupid... Well, a huge stupid gardening offer. The grounds of a great, old opera house in Philly. That's amazing. The Philly part... Yeah. Oh, here, after you. I'm so sorry, but you can't come in right now. There's a restraining order to protect Ms. Wingo. That's ridiculous. Are you kidding? I'm just picking up my kids. As soon as Ms. Wingo leaves, you can come inside. You know me, Gus. I'm not dangerous. This is cra... No, now, let's not have another scene. Here, I'll... I'll get the kids. She's an asshole, Pheebs. [upbeat music] ♪ Wanna make her happy ♪ 
♪ Put it heavy on your mind ♪ 
♪ One sample of my love ♪ Frumpkis' Charlene booked Zooey's flight first class. That's nice. Oh, she's tiny. You throw her in coach with a can of Pringles, she's happy as a clam. Now it's gonna be, "Where's my hot towel, Ma? Wah." They're trying to buy my kid. Ask them to change it. Oh, no, no, Charlene told her all about it. She'd be crushed. Unbelievable. Frumpkis spent all my money on horses for that bitch, and it turns out she's loaded. I liked it so much better when we thought she was a toothless hillbilly. I know, right? Jesus. You know, there's Pinterest, doll, So, so, so, so 2010. I'm trying to nail down some visuals for my meeting with SheShe. Pinterest. I have to wow them. Pinterest. [doorbell dings] Sweetie! Hi! Hi, Mom. I got to go, I got to go. Got to go! Hi, I missed you. Bye, Charlie. Hi. Can I talk to you outside for a moment, please? Uh, oh, okay, sounds serious. Thank you, yeah. Um, I ju... [moans] That was good, right? You thought you were in trouble. Wow, somebody's in trouble. Oh, my God. Okay, okay, the kids could come out here. [phone buzzing] Oh, my God. It's Becca? Mm-hmm. She's calling a lot. Well, she has that sixth sense that exes get when they know you're moving on. My car's parked down the street. Let's go. The douche mobile? I don't think so. It'll be fun. No, it's itsy-bitsy, Jake. You're just gonna have to be patient. [funky music] ♪ Okay, okay, he's got my number ♪ 
♪ And you can, you can ♪ Oh! [panting and moaning] Oh, God. Orange pants, how I have missed you. [both chuckle] Oh, God, promise we won't lose this. This spontaneity. Promised. Come here. [both moaning] Jake, are we... stop! Wait, Jake! Oh! No! ♪ Or don't give it to me at all ♪ 
♪ Yeah ♪ [car alarm wails] You hit the parking brake with your knee. Yeah, I was just shifting. Small car. Yeah. Why were you guys in dad's car? We needed a private place to have a very serious... Sit down, money... money talk. Dad, is it totaled? Do I still get the Porsche when you die? What? I never said that. [chuckles] [horn beeps] Okay, that was a very expensive money talk that we just had. Yes, and we're not done. I'm not finished. Nor am I. So what is this about getting our stuff when we die? He made a whole list. It's a small one. Shut up, assmunch. [lively music] Oh, coffee for me unbidden? How positively wifely of you. Do not start, or I will take it back. So Abby and the girls are insisting on an audience with you. They want to get to know the soon-to-be Mr. Gordon Banai. I can take whatever they dish out. Just tell me when and where. No, thank you. So... how would you feel about eloping? Eloping? Eloping. Isn't that something that usually happens with a knocked-up teenager and a gun-toting father? The girls are just asking all these questions, and I don't want a big fuss. Now that we've decided, I just... I want to be married. Okay, well, if that's what you want, then I guess I'll stop shopping for my gown. Really? Hmm. [laughs] You're amazing. Ms. Wingo wants $10,000 for emotional distress, a public apology, and a non-disclosure form. That's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. Just so I'm clear, the two of you never had a consensual sexual relationship? No. I was 14. How am I the one that is in trouble here? Look, I wish we could lock her up and throw away the key, but it's probably best just to get this over with quickly and move on. Ugh. So you're saying I should just settle? I'm saying the fight could get long, costly, and emotionally draining. What if I got a few of the other girls she did this to to come forward? Then it would be a different story. [lively music] ♪ ♪ Max! Max, come on. You trying to kill me now? Sorry, I'm just, uh... I think I'm gonna take this job. The Philly job? Yeah. Really? What's Ford say? He gets it. It's a big job. Wow, Jesus, man. Yeah. Well, tell Ford I'm around if he needs me. Obviously. What did Abby say? Well, she was pretty bummed, but it's not like I see much of her lately. She's always busy. I think maybe things are heating up with her and Will. Hey, how'd she react to the Becca baby news? Seriously? Oh, man. I'm still the only one who knows? You know what? I was gonna tell her. I just haven't found the right time. Maybe you're just afraid that if you tell her you did something that dumb, it might stop her from ever taking you back. Well, I think that ship has sailed probably. [laughs] Probably? You know my sister. She likes things in the open. Secrets kill, Jake. Secrets kill. All right, let's go. Break's over. [lively music] ♪ ♪ Jesus Christ! Those are, like, serial killer duffel bags. Who do you got in there, Martha Stewart and Ina Garten? Those birds are cooks. I'm a chef. Of pastry, say it loud and proud, mister. Seriously, what do you got in there? Well, this is my stuff, and that's my food. We have food in LA. I don't know if you know that. Yeah, but I have to source it, check it for allergens, make sure the produce is organic. For such a dude, you are such a chick. Yeah? Uh-huh. You want to try me? I'll show you I'm no girl. Oh, stop it, come here. So where are you staying? Yeah, I was gonna call you about that, but, um, well, I unplugged. No cell. No tech. So where am I taking you, freak? Hello? Mama! Hey, you, hey. There's a guy camping in the backyard. Look. See? Can we have s'mores? Please, please, please... Abby, I told you about Scott. Scott, Abby. Abby, Scott. Yes, you did, but not that he would be here. You have a lot of expired stuff here, lady. Bad for the body. [laughs] It's just not a good time, okay? I have an interview for a big job this week. And my new bakery is opening next week, and I've got this hot house flower here with all these allergies, and he has no place to stay, and I'm dying. He's harmless. Four days max. I love you so much. That's it. But you tell him to stop manhandling my kitchen. I love you. Thank you. Oh, and by the way, I have been thinking about our living arrangement. Yes, me too. I mean, you and Zooey cannot live in this tiny, little space forever. Exactly, which is why I want to make it bigger. I... k... what? I want to take some of my settlement money and build you a second story. So Zooey and I are here to stay. It's exactly what you and I always talked about this, remember? Compound living... Everybody talked about it. It takes a village. Everybody talked about it. We could actually do it. It's a... it's a big idea. It's huge. You and I, the village that it takes. Don't decide now. Think about it, okay? Okay. All right? But Jo, we still need to talk about... Oh, oh, oh, oh, by the way, whatever he tells you, do not sleep with him. He's kind of a s*x addict. [laughs] - ♪ Ooh ♪ No, I... I totally get it, but I think that if we... If we went in together... Ugh, okay, got it. Hi. Uh, just one second. Um, can I have some... Thank you. A white wine. No, I mean, yeah, you too. Ugh! Worst day ever. Oh, really? Do you have a crazy English baker living in a tent in your backyard? I don't think so. No. That sounds kind of sexy. It's not. No, I'm just trying to get some of the girls I used to model with to back me on this whole Kori thing, but they don't want to relive the past, or they're embarrassed, or... God, I hate this world. Maybe I should just settle. No, do not do that unless you want to regret it for the rest of your life. Ladies. All : Oh! I hear that you have some questions for me. Oh, yeah. My coach wraps me in plastic wrap, and then he has me run all over the place. Oh, man. It's abuse. Yes, but on a brighter note, um, the bacon cheeseburger was really good. It better have been. Um, ladies? Yes. Yeah. Private conference. [clears throat] Do we approve? Absolutely. Hell, yes. Oh, I'm in. Yes. Winner. Let's talk wedding. Whoo! Oh, no. Do not get married at the beach... it never ends well. That rings true to me, yes. You both should be wearing shoes. Ooh, I have a connection at Oscar de la Renta, and I'm sure they would design something spectacular for Delia. Oh, my God, can I just have a wedding again and not get married? I did it so wrong the first time. Wait a minute, I have to record this for SheShe. This is really good. Don't get married again just for the do-over. Um, ladies? Ladies, I hate to break it to you, but we're going to be eloping. No. What? Boo! Are you kidding me? I know, boo is right. No, no, no, no, no. I... look, I'll let you guys take it up with her. No. And her timing couldn't be better. Hey, beautiful. So did you get enough time? No, no, no, go away, too soon. Shall I walk around the block? Well, we found out you won't be needing these. That was such a blast. Aww. Be good to our girl. I will. I'll do it. Well, you are the coolest capitalist pig I've ever met. That's... That's a total compliment coming from her. Yes, Phoebe? Don't go home with the boring people. I have to. Please? Both my kids have sleepovers, and I'm gonna see Will tonight. Ooh, [babbles]. I promise we will paint the town soon. Okay. Bye, sweetie. Drive safe, you guys. Good night. 
 
 Delia? Delia? Please have a wedding. Please, I need a pick me up. Maybe Delia should drop you home. I am fine. No. I've just had a day. I know. I've had a life. I need a cigarette. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [sighs] You're a good man. I try. Where's your ring? Oh, God, I took it off at work. It seemed showy. My client's husband left her for his facialist. But you left it there? I mean... I wasn't thinking, but I will swing by work, and I will get it because my finger feels naked without it. (Phoebe) You guys, you guys, this is Phillip. Phillip is a welder and a smoker, and I'm in love with him. Good night, Phillip. Say good night, Phoebe. Mmm, good night, Phoebe. Good night. [passionate grunting] [moaning] [grunting] Oh, holy sh1t! [laughing] Oh, my God. Is it okay if I actually tell you that you've gotten better at that? [laughs] Wow. [chuckles] Okay. [grunts] You sure you can't stay? We both have work to do. We're not gonna do any work. [giggles] I got that meeting with JGL tomorrow. Ah, Joseph Gordon. Yeah. I have to prepare too. The only direction Cat gave me was lean into my brand, which means... I think that translates into, "Keep it sassy, gal." Oh, yeah. Or, um, "You do you." [laughs] Um, you know, at a certain point we're actually gonna have to talk about what's going on here, right? I know. Can't we just keep it secret and delicious for now? Mm. So, I want to talk about our relationship, and you don't? We are truly Jake and Abby 2.0. [laughs] Okay, no, no. Mm. Okay. To work, to work. No. Jo is down there watching "Top Chef" with the tent guy. Sorry. Can we have s*x again? Can you? Really? I... I didn't mean it like that. Well, I mean... It's been, you know, you're old. We could go around that. [phone buzzing] Oh, look at that. Another ex with a sixth sense. Sorry. Will. I, um, may have not told him the whole story. I said that we only talked all night. I know, it's... I was confused, and, uh, you know, it's just so not his fault. Right, so you should probably try to drag it out and break his heart very, very slowly. Okay, I will tell him tomorrow. [sighs] [footsteps approaching] Wowzer, check out that rock. Jesus, Albert! I'm sorry. I saw the light. Working late? Is that from who I think it's from? It is. [whistles] Gonna hate losing you. Oh, come on, I am not going anywhere. Till you get knocked up. Then it's bye-bye. Might as well quit now. Oh, well done, Albert. That is both sexist and possibly actionable. Please, that man knows what he wants. He's gonna put a baby in you before you've had a chance to come to your senses. Good night, Albert. Good night, kid. [lively music] ♪ ♪ [whispering] Marco? Marco, are you up? Marco? Come on. Come on.

Why is everyone so serious? You need to sleep that off, okay? Marco, please don't. Marco, please, come on. Please, please, please, please. Look, babe, I know you're hurting, okay? I understand, but I can't be with you like this. I... when you're drinking, I can't. [somber music] I know. Okay. I'm sorry. I just can't believe Kori's gonna get away with this. Well, don't let her. I don't have a choice. You always have a choice. You're tough as hell. Did you have a good time tonight? It was great. I kind of like what they bring out of you, sort of an easy, fun side. I like it. Wow, get in the slut shot. So I have a question for you. I ask you something, and I'm gonna be fine whatever your answer is. Oh, boy. Your friends seemed kind of excited about the prospect of a wedding. Yeah, I'm not having a big production just for my friends. Well, it's not for them. It's for me. Wait a second, you want a wedding? I want a huge, crazy feast. I want to see you in a outrageous gown. I... Ugh, Gordon Beech... To celebrate us. Groomzilla. You... no, I'm serious. I know, I can see that, and what you're describing sounds like the seventh circle of hell. Really? Really, though? Yeah, uh-huh. You're being honest? I mean, you're telling me that somewhere inside there is not a little girl who's always dreamt of her wedding day? You know what? I'm sick of being told that I don't know my own mind. I'm pretty damn clear. I'm not gonna be a professional wife, and I'm not anybody's blushing bride! [lively music] [bell ringing] ♪ ♪ Hi. Um, I called about career day? Of course.

Good-bye, Jake. [dark music] So how would you describe your baking style? (Scott) It's like Julia Child but in briefs. Is that the only thing that sets you apart? That you're a guy's guy baker? Seriously? I told you, I am not answering any insipid questions. I think what sets Rize apart is that Scott here is such an innovator. Hello? He really is... hi. What's going on? Abby, Abby McCarthy, the writer. This is her, uh, place. She's my best friend. I cannot believe we are here again. Again. Why didn't you ask me? It was a last minute thing.

Just... just give us, like, one hour. Here's the thing. I have been thinking about things, and I don't think it's a good idea for us making this permanent, you know, living together. Oh.

It is awful, and all the media around it is so glum, it feels like it needs a warning label on it like, "May cause anxiety or a**l leakage." [light laughter] Okay, but I feel like... Okay, sorry, Barbara, sorry. Um, I absolutely want to hear your opinion, but if you can just let me say what I'm saying, and then we can discuss afterwards, that would be great. What I am saying is that whatever our circumstances, we choose our attitude, and we can help make that attitude more positive. How about a weekly column on post-divorce style?

As a 14-year-old model, I was thrust into an adult world where innocence was a commodity to be bought and sold." Seriously? And? Okay, if this is how you want to play it, then I will see you in court. Kori, let's just go. I will be happy to go into explicit detail in front of a judge all on the public record. You are so crazy. That's what people like you say when they're cornered. [scoffs] No one's gonna believe you, Phoebe. And that, they say that. Try me, Kori. I've got nothing to lose. [upbeat music] You should probably move along. ♪ ♪ People are staring. Come on, Bonnie, let's go. She's insane. Let's go, Dezi. Totally nuts. Nice to meet you. ♪ ♪ [sighs] Excuse me, I, uh... if I insulted you in any way... Listen, Abby McCarthy, if you're what the boss wants, I will make my peace with that. I'm sure the rest of the team is thrilled about your shiny, new life and your happy, life-affirming divorce. I'm sure they're thrilled about your Pilates and your facials and your new look. Here's what my post-divorce life looks like: sh1t. Four years ago, my husband left me for my sister. Oh, my God. He doesn't give me a dime. He doesn't see his kids because he's too busy banging my younger sister. I have a special needs kid. My mother has Alzheimer's, so I have no help. You know the last time I had a night out? Never. You want the section to be all positivity? You want to be the new face of divorce? Knock yourself out. But this is what the real face of divorce looks like. It's stressed out, it's old before its damn time, and it's scared to death. Barbara... Ms. Sawyer. Please, let's pretend there's a door here. There's a door, and I am shutting it. Hey. Hey. What's up? How was your meeting? Oh, yeah, I had to skip it. Um, I got, like, loaded up with paperwork, so just kind of ran out of time. That such a good idea? With, you know, the other night and... I really upset you with the drinking. Yeah, no, it's fine. Yeah, you know, I... I got a little triggered, whatever. It's not a big deal. Just... I'll call my sponsor. It's fine. [phone ringing] Hey, Albert, what's up? Really? Really? No, that's amazing news. Thank you. No, of course I will. Thank you so much. Bye. [ZZ Ward's "Blue Eyes Blind"] Kori dropped the charges. You won. I won. I won, I won, I won, I won. I won, I won! [squealing] I've never won anything in my life! - ♪ I feel the moon hitting the blacktop ♪

♪ That I just can't see ♪ 
♪ ♪ Oh, you feel so good. You too. [cell phone ringing] ♪ ♪ Hey, you okay? You were right the other day  when you said I was rushing a big decision. Did I say that? Yeah. You asked if I was sure, and I realized I wasn't. I was doing what my head said, not my heart. Okay, so... I'm keeping it. I'm gonna have the baby. Oh, sh1t. Really? That's what you have to say? No, no, no, not you. I dr... I dr... I dr... I'm getting called to set. I'll talk to you later. - Yeah, o... ♪ Ooh ♪ 
♪ Ooh ♪

♪ Make my blue eyes blind ♪ [giggling] [moaning] Amazing. Mmm. What just happened? [zipper closes] Oh, my God. I just thought, "This, uh, might be the last time I touch her like that." I should have let the feeling pass. What? I got to go. I have a dinner with my publisher. Uh, about your... your book? Did they buy it? Yeah. That's amazing. Will... Don't. You've been avoiding me. You slept with Jake the other night, right? I don't deserve this, Abby. I know. I should have told you. What, you thought the kid wouldn't figure it out? You know, I thought you might take me seriously, but you never did. 'Cause of this whole age thing, you never, ever really saw me... That's not true. That's not true. I think you're the most amazing man, and I... I... I never meant to... Hurt me? You lied to my face. You pushed me away again and again. [car engine starts in distance] [somber music] I have a family. I have children. [sighs] I owe it to them to try. Just tell me, what we had, you and me, you tell me that you ever felt like that with him. He's the child, Abby. I give you a month, two tops, before he's sucking you dry again. I know you can't understand... No, I do. You're a coward. See, you would rather go back to suffocating than to risk a chance at something real. You have no idea how rare we were. Will, please, I care about you so much. Yeah, well... ♪ ♪ See, I love you. ♪ ♪ I would've done anything for you. [crying] ♪ ♪

♪ Call, I call ♪ Hey, are you okay? Um, sorry. Let me just wash my face. No, no, what's going on? Um... Bad day. Okay. What? Can you just hold me? Just... tight. I'm sorry. Okay. We're gonna do it right this time, aren't we? We're different. Absolutely. Hey. We're different. Abby, my laser cat shirt... Oh!
