 Harris won't say he's my boyfriend. 
 So he's not big on commitment. 
 Not so much. Not yet anyway. 
 JD. 
 Hi. 
 Um, you look nice. 
 Do you want to go get some tacos? 
 And you are? 
 My name's Carl. 
 You're a gigolo? 
 Prefer "companion," but yeah. 
 [panting] 
 This is how you like it? 
 Yeah. 
 You okay? 
 I had a bad date. 
 Well, I've been meaning to congratulate you. 
 Gordon Beach, I mean, come on. 
 Doorman had this for you. 
 Maybe it's a wedding present. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Here's your card. Enjoy your day. 
 _ 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you so much. 
 ♪ To remind me of the first night ♪ 
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ 
 Oh, excuse me. Abby. 
 Abby, friends don't let friends text and walk. 
 You could hurt yourself. 
 Sorry. 
 It's just Harris is on fire with the texts. 
 Ooh, Harris has got it bad. 
 Yeah, you have no idea. 
 We had a talk the other day... 
 Okay. 
 About seeing other people, which honestly was very hard for me. 
 Mm-hmm. - But as soon as I agreed to it, suddenly he is just all about me. 
 I think it was just something he needed to say. 
 Yeah, I think you played that right, Abby. 
 You think so? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Girls, girls... 
 Hi. 
 I am here to celebrate, ladies. 
 Ms. Badass Banai's freeing me of Frumpkis. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? Is your divorce final? 
 Not only is it, but the Frumpkii have given up all claim to the bakery. 
 That's amazing. 
 Jo! 
 Rize is mine! Rize is mine! 
 [shrieks] 
 Let's get bombed, baby! 
 Boo, I can't. 
 I have to go home and write after this. 
 No, no, you can not. 
 I declare this a national holiday. 
 Frump Freedom for all. 
 I wish I could, but I am kind of screwed. 
 My book is due in a few weeks and I'm on chapter three. 
 Well, maybe we can help. 
 We've got three divorces between the two of us? 
 Three. That's right. 
 I mean, all I have of chapter three is exactly... nothing. 
 Except the title, which is, uh, "Who do we belong to? Embracing non-monogamy." 
 Or "Fun with non-monogamy." 
 Soon as we honor Delia, I'm just going straight home to my desk. 
 Got it. 
 You have it together then. 
 You're gonna be great. 
 Okay. 
 Hey! Woman of the hour! 
 Power woman! 
 Oh, hi! 
 Hi! 
 Thanks so much... Mwah... For coming. 
 Oh, well... 
 [phone rings] 
 I-I'm sorry, I have to... 
 I'm sorry. I have to... 
 Something terrible is happening. 
 What? 
 I still don't have a drink in my hand. 
 [phone chimes] 
 Oh, Jo. 
 Oh, my God, Abby. We are going inside. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Delia's event. 
 I'm sorry, I'll meet you in there. 
 I have to go to the restroom anyway. 
 Oh, Harris. 
 [phone chimes] 
 Abby? 
 What? Carl! 
 I thought what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. 
 Hi. 
 Usually, yeah. 
 Hi. 
 But I'm actually here with a client. 
 How are you doing? Oh, you're working. 
 Yeah. 
 Which one is she? 
 You know I can't tell you that. 
 Discretion is everything in my line of work. 
 Of course. Yes, I understand that. 
 How would you feel if you were Cameron Diaz? 
 Is it really Cameron Diaz? 
 No. I wish. 
 Oh. [both laugh] 
 Don't do that to me. 
 Look at you. 
 You look beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 You know, I've been in L.A. off and on. 
 Really? 
 And I thought about looking you up a lot. 
 Really? 
 I just... I don't know, I didn't know if it'd be weird. 
 No, I'm very flattered. 
 In that case, can I see you again? 
 I mean, technically, I do owe you, because you paid, but you didn't get the full boyfriend experience. 
 I was very satisfied with my experience. 
 You gave a great foot massage. 
 Magical hands. 
 You really do. 
 That's bad for a Republican. 
 [shudders] Gosh, now I need to bathe. 
 [both laugh] 
 Here's my card. 
 A card? 
 Here until Friday. Love to see you. 
 ♪ Remind me of the first time ♪ 
 Bye-bye. 
 Bye. 
 ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ 
♪ Willing to fall in forever if it feels right ♪

 Hey! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Phoebe! 
 What? 
 You're not gonna believe who I just ran into in the lobby. 
 Lady Gaga. 
 What? 
 What? 
 I don't know. 
 I was thinking about Lady Gaga. 
 Carl. From Vegas. 
 No! The gigolo? 
 Oh, my God. 
 The gigolo! 
 No, he's a companion. Please keep it down. 
 He's here. 
 Oh, I have to meet this guy. 
 No, sit down. Jo, sit down. 
 'Cause he is working if you know what I mean. 
 What? 
 Oh, my God. 
 [cell phone rings] 
 Albert. 
 Hey, I thought you were getting an award. 
 Where have you been? I've been calling all morning. 
 Breakfast meeting, why? 
 Someone sent photographs of the two of us in a hotel to Gordon's house. 
 What? Did he see them? 
 No. But, Albert, what the hell? 
 Someone's following us. 
 Gordon? You think he's on to us? 
 Jesus, I don't know. 
 I don't think so; he seemed totally normal this morning. 
 What about Sherry? 
 She's at Terranea for couple of days  getting wrapped in seaweed. 
 She should be home tomorrow, I think. What are we gonna do? We are going to stay cool. Cool? Okay, how? Just try to keep your game face. Okay. We will figure this out. Okay. When are we gonna meet this sad Dr. Sexy Pants? I have no idea. Honestly, I don't even know when I'm gonna see him next. So ask him. I don't want to seem clingy. He has been texting you ever since you got here. Stop being so coy and say, "I want to see you." I'm with Abby on this one. He wants to stay casual. She has to be more casual than he is. Oh, come on, no. What if he freaks out about... Who cares? I did it. I told him I want him now. All right... That is what a feminist looks like. Hello. All right. Boom. Oh, wow. And he texts back already. What'd he say? He is in DC at the... at the Correspondents Dinner. He'll be back in a few days and then when he gets back, we will find a night. Okay, well, there's your answer. He'll see you in a couple of days. Hmm? The Correspondents' Dinner is a big deal. [scoffs] Is it? It's political nerd prom. It's black tie. The President's there. He didn't tell you he was going? Yes, I knew about it. I didn't know it was this week. He did tease me about needing a date, so... Well, maybe he didn't have a plus one. Yeah. [microphone squealing] Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome you all to Power Women 2016. [applause] All right! I have the extreme honor of presenting our annual Power Women award to one of the most dynamic, brilliant, and powerful women in this great city of ours, a fierce advocate for her clients... Okay... [phone chirping] A strong, unwavering professional, and the kind of role model I want for my daughters. Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Delia Banai. Whoo! Ow! [cheers and applause] [upbeat percussive music] ♪ ♪ We love you! ♪ ♪ Thank you. ♪ ♪ Do not tell me you're live-tweeting this sh1t show. Sorry, no, I'm reading Harris's Twitter feed. He's... he's at the Correspondents Dinner in DC. That's cool, he's with the Obama. That's fine by me. It's just, I'm hoping he didn't take that woman from New York as his date, you know, from the book convention, because she is just... Oh. Are you okay? Albert's wife had us followed. She has pictures of us in a hotel, and if Gordon finds out, my life is over. Hey. Let's breathe, okay? Okay. It's just... my career. It's my life, Abby. This is everything that I have worked for. And I screwed it up. Well, what did Albert say? He said to act like it's not happening and, he would work it out, whatever that means. What am I supposed to do, Abby? I can't go to work. I'm a wreck. Gordon... Oh, God, I can't tell Gordon. He's gonna know something's wrong. Can I stay at your house? Uh... oh, yes, sure. I'll tell him we're having a girl's night. Yeah, of course. Come and stay. Becca's there. She's living in the guest house. Okay. But we'll figure that out. That's not a big deal. And I have to warn you, I do have to write all night. I mean, like 5-hour energy drink/espresso writing. I'm not gonna make a sound. I just need a place to hide. My safe house is your safe house, so. Okay. [upbeat rock music] ♪ ♪ Hey, sweetie. Hi. How are you? What's going on? How was your day? Mom, you won't believe it. My coach says I'm a natural. He's like, "You have mad skills, Ja." Of course you do. You can do anything. She has such a strong serve. And a new outfit, I see. Oh, yeah, we saw them and we just fell in love, didn't we, Zo? Eey. Zo-eey. Oh, of course. Well, I just call her Zo. Oh, you might want to take that off so you don't get it dirty before the match. Yeah. The match? I'm playing in a tournament. Oh, my gosh, that's great. I can't wait to see you play. Actually, Mom... I'm so sorry, Joey. The parents aren't invited. I'm Jo. She's Zooey. Why can't the parents come? Well, the coaches want the girls to start seeing themselves as athletes and competitors. With the parents there, they might lose focus. That's not right. She's gonna be competing and nobody's gonna be there to cheer her on? I'll be there. Why do you get to go? Oh, first of all, I'm a team captain, and second, I'm not Zo's mama. I'm just her buddy. [both chuckle nervously] Please, Mom? Yeah. Yeah, sure, why not? Yeah, of course, if it's club rules, then... Of course. Why don't you go change? Okay. She's so cute in that. You give it a rest, psycho. I think we both remember what you were doing with Scott the last time we saw each other. You are not right in la cabeza. So let me be clear. If you do one thing around my kid that is remotely nuts, I'm coming after you. You understand? Yes. Change of venue, so it'll be on Tuesday now... [phones ringing] I thought you were staying home. I need to know what's going on. She wants you fired. What? No. Delia, it's okay... No, it's not okay, Albert. And by the way, why doesn't she want you fired? Because she wants me to keep making the money she so loves to spend. Look, she's upset but I promise you, I will handle it. How? A few days will pass, I'll say I'm sorry, we'll plan a vacation, it'll blow over. It always does. I'm sorry, what? Have you done this before? Not this. But I've had flings. Flings. Plural. Yes. Although this one could cost me. You're a pretty big fish. Who were the little fish? [sighs] It was just one night stands, mainly... [audio distorting] Paralegals... Women who were around the office. They meant absolutely... [indistinct laughter and chatter] Hey. Hey! Oh, my God, you came! Hey, Abby. Hey, what's going on out there, Payton? The gang for "Blood Sisters" never got a chance to say good-bye to Becca. It all happened so fast. So they just wanted to come by and throw her a little baby shower, is that cool? Just as long as there's only a couple people. For sure. Okay. Great, great, all right! Abby. Why don't you come have a drink with us? The girls... They're catching us up on everything that's happened on set. I can't. I have to write. Big deadline. Oh, got it. We'll keep it down. And Abby... Thanks for being so cool. That's me. Coolio.

Now I'm distracted by all this. No, you know what? This is what I agreed to. The problem is that he's "having fun with non-monogamy" while I am sitting here, trying to write about it, without having lived it. I like where this is going. Yes! I need to get out there and do some research. Starting now. Bring it on in here, fellas. Say "Hottie sandwich!" Both : Hottie sandwich! [laughs] Tag me on Instagram, sexy. I will definitely do that. [muttering] How do I do that? Um... Hey! Hey! You're having fun. Am I crazy, or is Kip, you know, hitting on me? You are not crazy. Kip would hook up with anything. Not that you are anything. That's not what I meant. I know what you meant. And I'm not looking for picky. I'm just looking for pick me! [laughs awkwardly] I'm kidding. Let's me and you take a picture. Oh, God, no. Let me see. Abby! You look camera thin. Did you lose weight? I did not, and that's just the pregnant talking. God, I know. I'm like a beached manatee. Well, manatees are cuddly and adorable. It's got to be so much harder to be not allowed to move. This whole bed rest. I can only imagine. Look at all these insane gifts you got! Oh, my God. "Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy." I should have been the one that gave this to you. Oh, why didn't I think of this? Is there anything in there on bloating? Bloating. Bladder control. There's a whole section on body changes. And I-I did go a little bit overboard on the whole diarrhea thing. I kind of forgot I'm living with the expert. I know. Apparently I did too. [gasps] Will you sign it for me? [laughs] Let's see. "To my ex-husband's ex-girlfriend who is currently my live-in, non-sexual girlfriend." Will I ever be able to wear a bikini again? You will, you'll get back in shape in no time. Abby.

I wasn't thinking about the damage I was doing to you or your marriage, and I'm sorry. I want you to know there was never anything substantial between us. It was a mistake. And it'll never happen again. Thank you. Can I go now? Not until you tell me: what do you really want? I want this to have never happened. You know I can't give you that. [sighs] I want the Malibu house titled to me as well as the London flat. I want the suite at Dodger Stadium, and I want the court-side Laker season tickets. Hold on. Seems fair. Is that it? What is this, a divorce negotiation? Are you leaving me? Not yet. That's it. For now. I think this firm still has some growth potential. Sherry. Hey. Hey. Sorry. I came in to get some milk and it just felt so nice in here. You all right? I think I'm gonna quit acting. I don't feel much like an actress. You are in the manatee stage. No major decisions. It's all so stupid, pretending to be a superhero vampire who's in love with a demon king. People are crazy about your show. Abby, I couldn't talk to anyone at the party last night. It's like they were speaking a foreign language. "So-and-so's hooking up with so-and-so" and "What's-her-name left the show." And I just didn't... care. It's okay. But I want to care. Those people are my friends, you know... What if we don't get each other anymore? I'll lose them. Maybe. But you can't force yourself to be somewhere you're not. I mean, I have been doing my damnedest with Harris, but... So, what? It's just over? No, it's not over. It's just different, maybe. Changing. What is? Everything. ♪ It's the starkness of the dawn ♪ 
♪ So show me where you fit ♪
