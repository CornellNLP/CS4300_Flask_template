 Previously on "Girlfriends' Guide To Divorce"... 
 Daddy and Becca are having a baby. I don't know what you're talking about. Dad stuck his pen1s in Becca's v*g1n*. I start SMC next week. What are you taking? Gender now. I am Professor Harper. I'm sure that your parents are glad that you finally ditched the deadbeat husband. They have barely mentioned our split at all. I have all these big ideas. I don't need help. Robert is presently a co-owner at the bakery. I can't be friends with you because I want to have s*x with you. What are you doing? I don't know. But right now this is the best I can do. Mom, Charlie wet your bed. He hasn't done that in years. I think he's probably regressing because of the baby news. Mom, wha... Are you wearing Crocs? I am. Charlie demanded it. I'd already lost the will to live. Weirdo still acting super weird? He is. He needs constant coddling, and he hasn't slept in his own bed since... Since I've been at Dad's? I feel bad. Should I come back early? This is not about you. This is about all the changes. This is the baby, your dad leaving. What's happening? Uh... so I've kind of been texting her... Becca, I mean. Well, I like her, and she's kind of stuck to us now. I just don't want it to be awkward. I agree. Text away, and I will be un-awkward. [pop music] Getting used to split custody takes time. Well, I got to stay busy this week, or I am going to lose it. Yeah? Yeah. My motto while Zooey's away with Frumpdick... What? Go big, play hard. That is why I'm plowing through online dates like it is going out of style, baby. Yeah! I love it. Who says that girls can't fool around like guys? No string attached. Just hot, naughty, down, dirty. Wow, Delia. What has gotten into you? What? Nothing. High knees, ladies! Don't make me call you out! What's wrong with Jo using s*x to, you know, release tension? Okay, I'm tense. I just... it's just with work and the wedding's just getting closer and closer every day. I'm just really... I'm kind of overwhelmed. Let it flow, you know? Let all your stress... take it out on good, old, Gordy. Phew! Hey, how's the hot new prof? He is so my bitch. Literally. He wanted to take me on a day date to MOCA... super classy. I have my whole "it's on" outfit picked out. Do you get extra credit for taking it off later? I know. It's super cliché... hot for the teacher... but I'm not going back to school for grades. I'm just trying to open myself up so my destiny can reveal itself to me, you know? Not a clue. Little Zen for me. Let's get those cardio kicks into gear! Oh, I hate these. Ah! Yeah! [grunting] Wow. [grunting] Oh boy, I bet I know whose face you're picturing right now. Oh, yeah. I may be sharing my baby girl with Charlene, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna share my business with that witch. Hey, I did some digging. What? If you can prove that your inheritance covers 60% of Rize's down payment, Frumpkis has no case. Bakery's yours. [gasps] Delia Banai, you sexy little minx. I could kiss you with tongue right now. No, no. All right, let's take it home! Knock it out! You inherited your bakery? It's a long story. See, my paranoid Puerto Rican aunt, she doesn't believe in banking. She won all this casino money... Sorry! Sorry I'm late. Hey. Where have you been? Everybody, welcome Abby. Oh, my God, my eight-year-old wanted me to dress him like he's a little baby. Oh, that's cute. It's not cute. I'm just glad he remembers he's potty-trained. Time! Class over. What? Kick some ass, ladies. Whoo! Ugh! What is this? What is this? Are you kidding me? What? No! My parents are in town, and they want to stay with me. Ugh. 'Cause I don't have enough going on already. No. Rude. They didn't even ask? [Jo groans] How am I gonna get through this life? You're gonna be fine. Jake is leaving in three days. You can, and you will. Hey, don't forget, you guys... tomorrow, super-secret appointment, Beverly Hills. Ooh! Oh! Are we perhaps helping you find your wedding dress? Perhaps. Oh! Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi. Bye. All right. Uh, who's coming with me? I will. Okay. Where did I park? [rock music] Professor? Wow. That's quite a dress. You can just call me Graeme. Okay, Graeme. Can I ask you something? Please. You'd tell me if I had something in my teeth, right? Nope. You're good. Hey, Professor Harper, sorry we're late. All right, the gang's all here. Come on, let's go. Hey, good to see you guys. Let's get going. [sighs] If I may, a toast. To the end of the case from hell. [chuckles] Who knew? After $100,000 in legal fees... Those two she-devils hug it out and now they're BFFs again. [laughter] Girls... who can figure 'em? Oh, well, excuse me. Ah, you two keep drinking. I'll be right back. I got to make a call. Okay. (Both)  Cin cin. Mm-hmm. [door opens, closes] Someone's in a playful mood. Mm-hmm. That case was a shackle on my Manolos, and now I feel weightless. Also, guess who's away on business. You want to play, mouse? Mm-hmm. Mmmmmm-mm. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Somebody could see us. Yeah, it's dangerous. I like it. Not if my wife or your fiancé found out. [sighs] Yeah, you're right. Sorry. It's just my body... it just doesn't feel ready to settle down yet. Nobody's telling you to settle down. [groans] Any kinky little wish of yours before walking down that aisle? As a matter of fact, a few. How do you feel about toys of the sexual variety? I've had my share of experience. Oh, yeah, this is gonna be fun. [door opens] Hey. I'm starving. You two hungry? Hey. Mm-hmm. [rock music] [man and woman moaning loudly] Oh, muffin! Muffin! Oh, yeah! Okay. [laughs] [gasps] Don't mind me. I can wait. I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry. He just smelled so good. Honey, this ain't the first time I've caught him in this position. What? You are such a bad person. Mm-hmm. I ju... Hey. Look... bu... What is this... "Naked and Afraid? Put on your clothes. She tore them off of me in the heat of passion. I have no idea where they are. Is there a reason why you're not yelling at me right now? I-I-I can't find the proof that I received cash from my aunt for the bakery. I think Frumpkis still has the paperwork... but... Why don't you just call her? Okay. Yeah, that's a... that's... that's a good idea. Thank you. Seriously, are you okay? You seem a little off. You know it makes me nervous when you don't yell at me. I'm fine, "Full Monty." Ah, excellent. My Tinder du jour's right on time. This isn't weird at all. Should I come back later? Oh, no. He likes to, uh, bake in the nude sometimes. Okay, bleach this place down, ho. And when I get back, these floors better be whiter than the granny hair on Kelly Osbourne's head. Those flowers for me? Let's go. Thank you. [gasps] Jesus! Oh, my God. I see Rosa finally took that time off, huh? Why, yes, she did. [Jake sighs] And my parents are coming to stay. Oh, no. It's the classic. They show up unannounced. They take up a ton of room. They're disruptive. No wonder you're uptight. I am no... I am... I am fine. I'm just busy. What? You got my emails, right? If we're gonna talk kid scheduling before I go to Latvia, it has to be this morning. I-I can't. I have a work call with Barbara in ten minutes. Abby, my assistant sent you three emails. He CC'd me on all of them. Jessup Durden. Yes. That is the name of your PA? Who would open this? I thought it was hillbilly p0rn. I didn't name him. Can we do this, please? One second. I will be all yours... for... [cell phone beeps] Oh, crap. Right. _ Eight minutes... I'm all yours. Okay, uh, the best time for me to Skype with the kids is going to be Saturday mornings at 7:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m.? You... you... you seriously want our teenage daughter to have a conniption? I'm ten hours ahead there. The only other time is Monday afternoon... Can't. Charlie's starting Hebrew school. Really? I mean, the kid can barely pee standing up. We're going to teach him the meaning of Modeh Ani? Jake, I really need this time away from him, because he is driving me bananas. Abby, if you have too much on your plate, I suggest that... [doorbell rings] Really? Always early. [cell phone vibrating] Always early. It's incredible, actually. _ [cell phone vibrating] sh1t. [doorbell rings] One minute! [doorbell rings] [chuckles] Hello, my little Bun Bun. Hi. Hi, Daddy. Hey. Oh, you look beautiful. Dina, George, good to see you. Hi. Hey. Likewise. Um, Jake was just heading out. Here for a second. We had to talk about... Oh. Your house always looks so fantastic. Thank you. Oh, I adore that new rug. How was your whole vacation cruise thingy? Do you have any peppermint oil? Um, uh, yeah, in here. Daddy's feet got swollen from the flight. I also need some eucalyptus too. Do you have some of that? This is... eucalyptus. Yeah perfect. Yes, yes. Home remedy. Take that with us on the boat. The ship? Didn't you just go on the cruise? [chuckles] Yes and no. We're going back on it tomorrow, but we really wanted to see you. Great. Are you only here for one day? George? Hmm? I thought you called her. Oh, not this guy. I thought you did. What? What? What is it? Honey, it's really nothing serious. Okay, George. Oh, yeah, it's the ranch in Sonoma. Now, we know it's your inheritance, but it turns out that your mom and I need it back to sell because our reserves are a little low lately. That's all. I'm so sorry. I just... What about your retirement plan? I-I had no idea you were so broke. [chuckles] We're not broke, dear. It's just the money we have left is simply not enough. If you need help with money, we can help. No. Abby, you know your father would never take money from you. He's too proud. The ranch makes perfect sense. And you are so busy. You barely get to it anymore. But I do. [chuckles] If you came up, you would know that. To me, it's not about how much it's worth. It's not money. It's... I mean, we were married there. Honey, look how that turned out. Oh Dina, easy, easy. I'm simply being honest. Bun Bun, we know the place means a lot to you. And we wouldn't ask if you weren't doing so well, but we're just... we're relishing our freedom, and y-your mom and I... we're more in love than ever. Mm. This is what the last chapter should be like, hmm? Mm. Aww. Mmm. Well, I'm really happy for both of you. Jesus. I'm sorry. Is there a problem? I mean, nothing new, no. I mean, we should have seen this coming... Jake, not now, please. Oh, and... these are the transfer-of-ownership papers for you to sign before we go tomorrow. But take your time, sweetheart. And thank you. I think I'm gonna pop into the pool. This is California, right? Ooh. Such a treat. You gonna come? That sounds fabulous. I am too. Yes, let's go. [both laughing] Have fun, you guys. Enjoy. I love the Dorothea Tanning sculptures. They're like waves of female forms melting together. You know, she was my mom's mentor for years. Your mom's an artist? Yeah. She's a lot of things. She's a poet, a photographer, a visual artist. Actually, she's having a show tomorrow night. I know it's kind of last minute, but... Are you inviting me? Yes. I would love for you to be my date. I'll text you the details? Great. [giggles] [sentimental music] ♪ ♪ [gasps] You're taking a nap. If you guys are sleepy, there's a bed down in the guesthouse. That mattress really hurts your father's back. Oh, oh. Um, okay. Okay. Hey, since you're here, my babysitter just texted, and she canceled on me. Oh. Do you think you guys could watch Charlie tonight? Oh, honey. You should have asked us earlier. We're going to dinner at Nobu... friends from the cruise. Okay. Sorry. Well, uh, maybe I will just drop Charlie at Jake's. Okay. We'll take the kids out for breakfast before we leave tomorrow. Thanks. Oh, you look really lovely, sugarplum. [chuckles] Thank you, Daddy. Have fun tonight. [both sigh] Okay. Mom, listen to me. We need to find her number. [cell phone beeps] Oh, God. This stupid service. Hey, are you Jo? I'm, um... She moved to El Salvador? Are you kidding me? Yeah? Hey, Crazy Spice. Can you take it inside? I'm trying to work in here. It's a free country, blanquito. I can do whatever I want. Shove it up your... Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! Sorry! Hi. I know what this looks like. I just need a favor. Let me guess... George and Dina just couldn't take him. Can we not do this right now? Fine, fine. I'll take him. Hey, honey. I got your text. Did you call Becca yet? Uh, no. Why... why are you calling Becca? She has the day off tomorrow. Lilly. Mom. Honey, I just need off the mommy clock for, like, three hours, or I'm gonna lose it. You tell them, sister. I'll walk you out. Come on. You coming or what? Come on.

I have an idea, but you have to come back to my place. Oh. Aww, I wish. I have family stuff. Let's make a deal. Tonight you do the family stuff, but then in a couple of days, you come with me on my business trip to Ecuador. Wow. Are you serious? What do you say? [phone trilling] Grr.

George, we... we watch him on TV. He is a catch. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, Abby. Okay. It's been very casual. But you like him, right? You could get serious. Maybe. [chuckles] I mean, he did ask me to go with him to Ecuador tomorrow. Oh, Abby. But it's very silly. I said no. No, no, get out of town. No, Abby, you have to. You should have said yes. Oh, we'll... we'll watch the kids. Yeah, absolutely. You know, we can fly down to Mexico and get the ship there, right? Yes. Okay. Huh? Don't be silly. I have a job. I can't. Of course you can.

 Harris Campbell. [chuckles] Well. Are you serious? Mm-hmm. I'm dead serious. Campbell! That's right. Got it. Now he gets it. Well, I'm just saying if it's an actual date, the teacher better make a move. I think it's chivalrous that he's taking his time. Sexy. You're meeting the mom on the first date? Sounds like he has issues. You're in a foul mood. Mm. My tia's MIA. And the guy I slept with last night was so hairy, it was like going down on a Chia Pet. Ew. Yeah. Uh-huh. Abby, come on. Mm.

Yeah. That's the problem? Yeah, it's just... I... it's just... I can't get out of my head. It's too distracting here. [chuckles] I need to keep it light and fun and... Okay? Well then, great. Whatever you want, kid. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really need to get back to work. Have fun. [sighs] So how long have you lived in LA? Oh, long time... about 45 years. Oh, that's longer than I've been alive. [chuckles] Uh, before moving here... You realize your profile picture is at least 20 years old, right?

Really, all-day sickness at this point. Well, if you don't feel well, we can always... No, no. It's okay. I really think we should talk through this. So I haven't seen Lilly since the news, and, uh... and I won't unless I'm sure you and I are good. We're good. Okay. Thank you for that. You know, Jake and I don't really have much of a relationship anymore... Sorry. Um, you know what? We don't need to have this sit-down. [chuckles] If, uh, you want to have a relationship with Lilly, have at it. That baby's related to her and to Charlie, and Jake is the parent that you need to be dealing with, not me. I wish you all the best. Becca? Oh, my God. Something's really wrong. Okay. It hurts. Oh, God. Can you call 911, please? You're gonna be okay. Oh, God, oh! [engine turning over, siren wailing] Here.

You don't need the whole sob story, but they're just... they're not really in the picture. Oh, really? I'm sorry. That's okay. Well... if you need anything, just call me. I will, I promise.

Well, then we'll just go get a cup of coffee. Can I have a hot chocolate? Yay! Yes, you can. Um, would anybody else like anything? Dr. Harris, would you like a latte or... Mom, not now. Oh, no. But thank you. Enough. Okay. Okay. There's no family. There's just us. Okay. So, Becca, you have a rare form of morning sickness... Hyperemesis gravidarum. Okay. Why... why does that sound familiar? Well, Kate Middleton had it with both babies. Usually it lets up by now, but since you're in your second trimester, I'm a little bit concerned about your kidneys and the baby. My baby? Why? What does that mean? Oh no, right now the baby's fine. In order to keep it that way, you're gonna have to remain on bed rest for the rest of your pregnancy. That means no more work, no more activity. Um, wow. Okay. ♪ ♪ I said bye to Jake. We're going home. Well, if you need anything... I mean, I don't know what your plans are. [chuckles] But I-I have a guesthouse. Whatever you need. I just... I-I'd like to keep in touch. I will. Thank you so much, Abby, for everything. Take care. Bye. ♪ Or show me heart ♪ 
♪ Come on, love, come on, love ♪ I need some serious carb loading after that. [chuckles] Here. No, thank you. I'm not hungry. Mm. Um, your parents took the kids to get something to eat. You should go home and get some rest. Yeah. And I am going to get on an airplane. Latvia. That's now. Mm. That's now. [chuckles] [groans] I have been so short with you. I'm so glad I didn't let you go before I said I'm sorry, because I'm so sorry. I think I'm just afraid to do this by myself... my life, our life. Me too. And I'm a nightmare when I'm stressed, so ditto on the apology. [chuckles] Did you decide on the ranch? No. I'm a little lost on that one. Here's the thing, Abby, what you did for Becca... not a lot of people would do that. So, if just this one time you decide to be a little selfish... Mm. You're not your parents. You'll never be your parents. And if you do decide to let it go... well, maybe you can let them go a little bit too... you know, silver lining. Go easy on yourself. You can't take care of everybody. See you... On the flip side. [chuckles] ♪ Show me heart ♪

So I pushed back the Ecuador trip by a day. I'm ready to go when you are. Wow. Rejected twice. I ju... my... my... Everybody needs me. I hope you understand. Of course I do. [chuckles] I'll call you when I get back. Okay. [door closes] Hey, asswipe. Ah, Frumpkis. I stopped by. I thought I missed you. I don't like having to worry about you. I grew up in the Bronx, remember? I meant what I said. You deserve to be happy, okay? Oh. Got a plane to catch? Frump, don't you give up. You got too much fight in you. I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I'm kind of going to miss you. So, uh, the people out there eat a lot of potatoes. Take it easy. I don't want you coming back looking like Michael Moore.
