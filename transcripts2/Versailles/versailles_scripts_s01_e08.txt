 I feel like taking the forest air. 
 Join me? 
 You know there'll be others? 
 Not like him. 
 The Chevalier's a traitor. 
 I had no choice. 
 Come! 
 A ride always lightens your mood. 
 You could've won! 
 You would've lost. 
 We can't have that, can we? 
 You should take the matter less to heart. 
 You imprisoned my friend. How should I take it? 
 The Chevalier was plotting against the Crown. 
 How should I take that? 
 He was trapped. 
 You know it. 
 He's gullible, easily influenced He meant no harm. 
 The decision was your King's, not your brother's. 
 Are you my brother? 
 Sometimes I wonder.

 What's happening? 
 Her Highness is ill, Sire. 
 Is my doctor there? 
 I'm going to get her now. 
 Her appearance? 
 The matter's already in hand, Sire. 
 Louis : Very good. 
 (Panting) 
 (Coughing, whimpering) 
 Ridiculous! 
 It's passable. 
 Until I speak. 
 Then you should speak as little as possible. 
 I'll be found out right away. 
 I see why you're anxious, but it's of little use. 
 What happened? 
 A miscarriage. 
 Will she recover? 
 Yes, Your Highness, with sleep and repose. 
 Why did it happen? 
 I don't know. 
 Many of nature's secrets are still a mystery to us. 
 Our visitor from England arrives today. 
 Bring him to me quietly and privately. 
 Yes, Sire. 
 Where's Fabien? 
 I've been looking, Sire, but so far without success. 
 He'll interrogate the Chevalier, who has a loose tongue, and certainly a lot to tell us. 
 (Cell door opening) 
 You are a fool. 
 What do you want of me? 
 Your silence. 
 They're going to hang me. 
 The King won't kill his brother's lover. 
 He'll spare you, but he'll torture you first. 
 If you talk of our group, I'll not torture or spare you. 
 I'll open you from gullet to groin with a fish knife. 
 Is that clear? 
 Yes. 
 (Trembling breathing) 
 All prisoners involved in the plot are in La Bastille. 
 We await Mr Marchal to question them. 
 They'll say whatever will save them. 
 Are they acting alone, or is someone else pulling the strings? 
 You shouldn't worry about the nobles, Sire. 
 Apart from the bluster, they're lazy and cowardly. 
 Aren't you a noble, Rohan? 
 My point exactly. I'm lazy and a known coward. 
 (Laughing) 
 If I may suggest, Sire, they should be executed, that's how to deal with traitors. 
 What talk in the salons? 
 Scared. 
 Good, that's how I want it. 
 (Footsteps) 
 I think you should release them, Sire. 
 Why should I do that? 
 Because gratitude will make them obedient and faithful. 
 Perhaps. 
 But I'd like them on a cold prison floor a little longer. 
 (Chuckling) 
 (Groaning and panting) 
 There's nothing to fear. 
 Don't fight. 
 Rest. 
 (Grunting) 
 Rest! Rest, my love. 
 (Panting) 
 What did you give me? 
 (Grunting) 
 A little potion to add spice to our passion. 
 I took some too. Remember? 
 (Grunting) 
 Now close your eyes. 
 You need sleep. 
 Water! 
 I need water! 
 Of course, my sweet. Now don't worry. 
 I'll stay until you're recovered. 
 (Grunting, clearing throat) 
 I think you ate something that disagreed with you. 
 You did say the pheasant tasted a little off. 
 It must've been that, mustn't it? 
 (signing) 
 Fabien? 
 (Ominous music) 
 Has the King visited me? 
 Please tell him I wish to see him. 
 He's attending to state matters, but surely he's thinking only of you. 
 I didn't see you there. 
 Come, sit with me? 
 I see your priorities are unchanged. 
 Good day. 
 (signing) 
 Did I lose the child? (Door closes) 
 Yes, Your Highness. 
 Maybe that's for the best. 
 (signing) 
 (Door Opening) 
 His Majesty will be here shortly, Sir William. 
 These are the palace plans? 
 Yes, Sir William. 
 He lacks nothing in ambition. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 An honor, Your Majesty. 
 I have a proposition for your King. 
 I'll hear it with great interest. 
 This discussion is to be divulged to no one but the King and those he trusts. 
 Of course. 
 I want to invade Holland. 
 I see. 
 Only England, her principal ally, could stop me. 
 How could I persuade England to join me in such a venture? 
 Money? Possibly. 
 Dutch trade routes? Almost certainly. But that's not enough. 
 What's a gift for a King who has almost everything? 
 What his family so carelessly tossed away: his faith. 
 Your Majesty, far be it... 
 He publicly claims to be Protestant, but at heart he's Catholic. 
 Let's not pretend. 
 He seeks renewed relations with Rome, but in their eyes he's a heretic. 
 My proposed agreement is simple. 
 We invade, England provides some resources, all costs are borne by France, I effect a reconciliation between the English crown and Rome. 
 Well now... 
 What better way to seal an alliance between friends? 
 I suggest a meeting 10 days hence at Dover Castle. 
 You'll come in person? 
 I haven't yet decided. 
 (Groaning, sniffling, panting) 
 Wake up! 
 (Grunting, panting) 
 (Coughing, vomiting) 
 (Groaning) 
 Have I been poisoned? 
 (Groaning) 
 Yes, I believe so. 
 With what? 
 Swollen eyes, marks on the hands, vomiting when I saw this before, the cause was arsenic. 
 I'll live? 
 If I can find an antidote. 
 But first, herbal salve for your eyes. 
 You will not. 
 Then you may lose the sight of both, a handicap in your profession, no? 
 (Sniffling) 
 No one must know I'm here. 
 Very well. 
 (Coughing) 
 I congratulate His Majesty on his brilliant plan. 
 Brilliance remains to be seen. 
 King Charles must become an ally, not a foe. 
 Will you go to the discussions yourself, Sire? 
 No, they mustn't think I'm so desperate for their support. 
 If I may be so bold, Sire, I'd send Feuquière, an experienced diplomat who thinks only of France. 
 Too methodical. Chanut, maybe? 
 His visit to Sweden was very successful. 
 A loose cannon. Croissy, perhaps? 
 A committed Anglophile, even rumored to like the food! 
 Henriette will go. 
 Your pardon, Sire, did you say...? 
 Indeed I did. 
 Henriette will go. 
 What does this mean? 
 Is His Majesty still ill? 
 Perfectly recovered, thank you. 
 Sire, with all due respect, she has no experience in such matters. 
 The stakes couldn't be higher, and for all her qualities, she's... 
 A woman? That hadn't escaped my attention, with the wit of any here and courage too. 
 She's also King Charles' sister. 
 She knows his weaknesses, no diplomat has what she has: his ear. 
 Your thoughts, Bontemps? 
 Shouldn't we consider whether Her Highness has the strength for such a journey? 
 Her mind may be willing, but her... 
 Body is also willing. 
 And if we waited a few months? 
 We can't. 
 William of Orange is now in the Dutch government. 
 The republicans are retreating, the House of Orange is on top. 
 He'll be King within 2 years. 
 If we don't negotiate with England, he will. 
 Louvois, you organize transportation. 
 Colbert, tomorrow's Gazette will say that Her Highness is going to Vichy after a minor illness. 
 Have you seen Mr Marchal? 
 Mme de Clermont! 
 Oh, good afternoon, Madame! 
 My dear, you seem preoccupied. 
 Oh, really? 
 We saw you the other day with Mr Marchal. 
 What a handsome couple! 
 It's true you saw us the other day, but false that there exists between us anything but respect. 
 How disappointing! 
 Yes, well you see I lost a necklace some days ago, a family necklace, I asked his help to find it, I feared it was stolen. 
 A wise decision. 
 Oh, yes! 
 We're playing cards later. I hope you'll join us? 
 Thank you, but I'm feeling a little unwell. 
 Tomorrow, perhaps? 
 I'd love nothing more. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Good afternoon, ladies! 
 (Cell being unlocked) 
 This is an honor, Sire. 
 May I say how terribly sorry, how ashamed... 
 Hmm! 
 Give me one reason why I should spare your life. 
 I could not, Sire. 
 I've betrayed your trust, allowed myself to be led astray. 
 I humbly beg your forgiveness. 
 Perhaps you should tell me who led you astray. 
 I cannot, Sire, on my honor. 
 Your honor? 
 A novel concept! 
 I swear, Sire, I've never set eyes on him. 
 I've no idea who he is, what he wants. 
 You think plotting against me helps my brother? 
 No, Sire. 
 I acted without thought and through fear alone. 
 I've killed rabbits with more courage than you. 
 He deserves better. 
 Yes, Sire. 
 The question is, what to do with you? 
 (Birds calling) 
 Good afternoon. 
 I must give you my Paris tailor's name. 
 (Scoffing) 
 (Footsteps) 
 Why are we here? 
 I don't know. 
 I thought you'd summoned us. 
 No. 
 It was me. 
 Good news for our cause. 
 The King's sending Henriette to see her brother King Charles. 
 Why? 
 Whatever the reason, she won't survive the trip. 
 How will you kill her? 
 Leave that to us. 
 Then what? 
 You'll learn soon enough. 
 I say we kill the King. 
 Oh, come now. 
 I hate the King as much as you. 
 I doubt it. 
 He destroyed your castle. His father destroyed my family, as well as thousands of Huguenots. 
 Mme de Clermont, first we force him out of power. 
 Our ally William of Orange gets stronger every day. 
 He'll give us the money and men we want. 
 Go now. When the time is ripe, you'll be given lists of persuadable people at court. 
 (Footsteps) 
 (Tense music) 
 I don't like that woman. 
 She's dangerous. 
 We're all dangerous. Focus on your job. 
 Very well. 
 When does the convoy leave? 
 Just after dawn. 
 There'll be 6 mounted armed guards and 2 bodyguards with her. 
 A 2nd convoy will join at Marly. 
 I'll kill her in the forest, then. 
 You're sure you can do so? 
 I know a perfect spot, used it often. 
 Good. 
 I've told William we must strike soon after her death. 
 And you trust him? 
 I do. 
 Our ends may differ, but our means are the same. 
 Very well. 
 Why does the King wish to see her? 
 It's not for me to say. 
 I'm her husband, I've a right to know. 
 You have a right to ask, not to know. 
 He's plotting something. 
 Henriette, let me do the talking. 
 The King will talk to Her Highness alone. 
 Your brother thinks he's in a strong position. He's not. 
 He's as weak or strong as you let him be. 
 He'll try to bend the treaty his way. You must be firm. 
 If he doesn't become our ally, the agreement's worthless. 
 Unless he signs, your mission will have failed. 
 What do you want of her? 
 I'm sending her away. 
 What for? 
 To negotiate a treaty. 
 I don't understand. 
 She's going abroad as my ambassador. 
 Ambassador of France? 
 Yes. 
 Where? 
 I'm not saying and neither is she. 
 Is this true? 
 Don't let him do this. 
 Do what? 
 Use you. 
 That's what he's doing. 
 Is that what irks you, or is it that she has a role you might've wanted. 
 What irks me is that you would take away all that is or should be mine. 
 Your friend the Chevalier is out of prison. 
 I believe he's in your rooms. 
 If he betrays me again, he'll be hanged in public. 
 I expect you to ensure he does not. 
 Are you strong enough to go? 
 I believe so. 
 I'm sorry for your loss. 
 Our loss. 
 My darling! 
 My return doesn't give you pleasure? 
 Only disappointment. 
 How so? 
 You've betrayed your King. 
 And me. 
 Do I get a chance to explain? 
 No. 
 Very well. 
 I'll go and find something to eat, preferably without maggots. 
 No, stay! 
 But don't touch me. 
 If you do it again, the King will have you hanged. 
 I will not. 
 I've learn my lesson. 
 And the thought of being hanged in public I wouldn't let it happen. 
 Thank you, my love. 
 I'd kill you myself. 
 
 
 
 Message for Mr Marchal. 
 Sure. 
 Bravo! 
 Oh, the luck's all with me today! 
 Another game? 
 If you insist. 
 Oh, but I do. 
 It's tempting to think you play cards just to humiliate me. 
 And why would I do that? 
 Another's suffering gives you pleasure. 
 I recall you're something of an expert on that. 
 Mr Marchal? 
 He's away. You may give me the message. 
 I beg your pardon sir, I only deliver to Mr Marchal. 
 I'm the king's valet, give me the message. 
 You've come from? 
 Pau, sir. 
 Hmm! 
 Beatrice, my dear, you played a spade, we're playing hearts. 
 How foolish of me! Oh dear! 
 You're from Pau, Beatrice? 
 Yes, I am. 
 What of it? 
 Nothing. 
 Just, the messenger said he came from Pau, and he had information for Mr Marchal. And I thought of you. 
 Other people are from Pau. 
 Surely! 
 (Gasp) 
 Of course. 
 A coincidence, I'm sure. 
 Yes. 
 Fabien : What do you know of love potions? 
 Love potions? 
 Yes, stimulants for intercourse. 
 I know what they are. 
 Why do you ask? 
 (signing) 
 Imagine two people took a love potion. 
 Imagine this potion contained poison. 
 How could one suffer from the poison while the other did not? 
 Either that person vomited the poison before it took effect or took an antidote beforehand. 
 Hmmm. 
 I want you to send a message to Bontemps, the King's valet. 
 I know who he is. 
 Yes. Tell him I need to see him. 
 Very well. 
 You know why you're going to England? 
 To test me? 
 There's no need for that. 
 I want you to go because it's your wish, not to please me. 
 There's a difference? 
 I don't know. Is there? 
 Did I do something wrong? 
 We used to be so close, and now... 
 Aren't we close now? 
 I don't know. Are we? 
 We're close to those we trust. 
 When you're with your brother, everything must show self-control. 
 Walking, entering a room, sitting down. 
 Betray no emotion. 
 Silence works better than speech. 
 When you speak, hold his gaze. 
 Look away, you've surrendered. 
 Play on his weaknesses, flatter, charm. 
 Be strong when you must, let him win when nothing's at stake. 
 For this, you're neither his sister nor my brother's wife. 
 You are France. 
 You are me. 
 Remember our first night together? 
 Yes. 
 Remember what I said in the morning? 
 No. 
 "Henceforth, every day that I don't touch you, taste you, feel you, will be a day of death and mourning... 
 I meant it then, I mean it now. 
 I've made a mistake, I've offended the King and I've offended you. 
 But my love's as strong as when we met. 
 Philippe, the truth is, if you don't love me, no one loves me." 
 (crying) 
 I'm so sorry. 
 (signing) 
 (Whispering) It's Montcourt! 
 What are you doing here? 
 Good to see you too, Louvois. 
 You'll be strung up if the King finds you. 
 No. 
 Not when I give him some information I have. 
 Of what nature? 
 Only for His Majesty. 
 Why would you give it to him? 
 In exchange for my return to Versailles. 
 How did you hear of it? 
 (Montcourt coughs) 
 In a tavern, Sire. 
 Conversation at an adjoining table. 
 What exactly did they say? 
 Only one spoke, Sire. 
 He boasted he'd kill your brother's wife on her way to England. 
 (Colbert clears throat) 
 Do you know the man? 
 Yes, Sire, from a former life. 
 A thief and a killer. 
 Where would we find him? 
 (Coughs) 
 He's part of His Majesty's police force. 
 He must be arrested. 
 If I may, Sire, I'd strongly advise against it. 
 He'll just deny all knowledge of it. 
 The only choice is to catch him red-handed. 
 How do we do that? 
 I know his methods. 
 I know where he'll be. 
 If this is true, France will be in your debt, but 'til then you'll be in custody. 
 Do you understand? 
 Of course, Sire. 
 So there's a traitor amongst us. 
 Sire, wouldn't this be a good reason to postpone Her Highness' departure? 
 Losing the chance to identify my enemies? 
 No. 
 Talk to Montcourt. Find out what he knows. 
 Mr Marshal's absent, so security's your job. 
 I needn't mention the consequences of the murder of the King of England's sister. 
 (Panting) 
 Mr Marchal wants to see you. 
 I went to your offices, there was no one there. 
 You had an assistant. 
 I fear we'll not see her again. 
 What happened to him? 
 (Clearing throat) I have a cold. 
 Who gave you this "cold". 
 My absence from court has been noted, I suppose? 
 His Majesty is less than pleased. 
 I'd be grateful if you'd tell the King that I've gone to Paris on an urgent matter. 
 Very well. 
 Before I forget, I have a message for you. 
 From where? 
 Pau. 
 Have you read it? 
 I have. 
 She is a liar? 
 She is. 
 The real Mme de Clermont died in a fire 10 years ago. 
 What made you suspect her? 
 Paper. 
 I don't follow. 
 Her documents of proof were dated 30 years before the paper they were written on was made. 
 The weave was modern. 
 Older paper has more fiber. 
 The ink bleeds differently. 
 How can you possibly know this? 
 My father was a printer. 
 You didn't have her arrested? 
 I doubted my own convictions, I'll not do so again. 
 Philippe : You can still say no. 
 I want to go. 
 But why? 
 Because he asked me to. 
 He didn't ask. He ordered. 
 I'm pleased to serve the King and France. 
 You won't win him back. 
 You know that? 
 That's not my intention. 
 I wish you a comfortable journey. 
 What are you doing? I can't leave Her Highness. 
 Reminding you to take care. 
 What... what do you mean? 
 There are dangers everywhere. Understand? 
 We're heavily guarded in complete security. 
 But if not, put your own safety before that of Her Highness. 
 What... 
 Enjoy your time in England. 
 England? I'm going to Vichy. 
 Montespan : I admire her. 
 Louis : Why? 
 For going away when she's ill. 
 She's going away to get better. 
 Don't you read the papers? 
 Of course. 
 She's going to Vichy. So silly of me. 
 I'm honored that His Majesty chose to see me last night. 
 I'd worried that I'd lost his favour. 
 You'll have to try a bit harder to lose my favour. 
 (Exhales sharply) 
 (Exhales) 
 Do you know who killed my father? 
 No, but I'm close. 
 This eye's well recovered. 
 The left still has signs of the poison. 
 What do you see? 
 The truth. 
 (indistinct whispers) 
 The assassin's been caught, Sire. 
 (Sniffs) 
 Mr Gruaud, you're a magician. 
 Hmmm? 
 Try it! Try it! 
 It's the perfect blend of sturdiness and refinement. 
 Ah! My good friend Montcourt! 
 I banished this man from court, never to see him again. 
 I welcome him back with open arms, a shining example to all, and proof that fidelity has its rewards. 
 Bravo, Your Majesty! 
 Bravo! Bravo! 
 (Applause) 
 My friend! 
 What are you doing here? 
 It's my home. 
 How did you gain the King's forgiveness? 
 I begged him for it, saying life away from Versailles wasn't worth living. 
 What about our other activities? 
 (Laughing) 
 We'll talk about this in private. 
 Excuse me, I must say hello to some old friends. 
 (Laughter) 
 You have a choice: reason or violence. 
 Let us begin with reason. 
 What's your name? 
 I forget. 
 On whose orders did you try to kill her? 
 (Sniffs) 
 You won't believe it but I can't remember. 
 Who? 
 You're too old for this and too much of a gentleman. 
 (Shallow breathing) 
 (Chuckling) 
 (Exhaling sharply) 
 Yes? 
 Mr Marchal, Sire. 
 Good evening, Sire. 
 In case you hadn't noticed, I'm the King of France. 
 We've recently uncovered a plot here in my home to destroy me and everything I've built. 
 My brother's wife was almost killed by one of your police. 
 As we speak, William of Orange is seeking ways to destroy me. 
 And you, my head of security, whom I pay to keep me alive, were in Paris. 
 I hope you had a pleasant time. 
 I wasn't in Paris, Sire. 
 That's what I was told. 
 The fault is mine, Sire. 
 There was an attempt on my life, so I concealed my whereabouts and condition from the person who did it. 
 An attempt by whom? 
 I don't have proof, Sire, so I beg your indulgence until I complete my investigation. 
 She may not come back. 
 Of course she will. 
 Saying anything else would be an admission of your failure. 
 She'll return. I know it. 
 Have you any idea what sort of place you're creating? 
 I know you'll tell me. 
 Your dream palace is becoming a haven of plotting, treachery, depravity, infidelity and immorality. 
 Did I miss anything? 
 That's exactly why I'm here. 
 You're angry I sent her to England. 
 She has a purpose in life. You don't. 
 I'm giving you one. 
 A job? 
 Yes. 
 Not going round with you saying yes all the time? 
 Sorry, that was infantile of me. 
 What do you have in mind? 
 Etiquette. 
 Etiquette. 
 I want the nobles brought to heel. 
 They plot against me, and treat this as their home. 
 They don't know how to address the royal family or each other, how to eat at dinner, how to be at Versailles. 
 I want them to know their place and status, every minute of the day structured. 
 From now on, everyone abides by the same rules. 
 Including the King? 
 Especially the King. 
 (Chuckling) 
 And who better to control the King than his brother? 
 (Knock on door) 
 Yes? (Gasps) 
 Oh! Mr Marchal! 
 I was worried about you. 
 So was I. 
 I went to fetch water, I returned and you were gone. 
 For 2 days I looked everywhere for you. 
 I was delirious, I didn't know where I was or what I was doing. 
 Luckily I was found and taken to a doctor. 
 Oh, good. 
 Yes, I thought I'd been poisoned. 
 Gosh! 
 But you were right. It was the pheasant. 
 I had some too, and I didn't feel too good. 
 Then I had to go to Paris on behalf of His Majesty, and now I'm back. 
 Something to say? 
 Well, as a matter of fact, yes. I... 
 Feel free to speak. 
 It's nothing. I'll tell you later. 
 You will stay, won't you? 
 No thank you. I just came to get my breeches. 
 Of course. 
 (Music) 
 I had them cleaned. 
 Most considerate of you. 
 (Intake of breath) 
 I'm very pleased you're recovered. 
 I bid you goodnight. 
 Goodnight. 
 Once it was so free of fog and thicket, wasn't it? 
 It was. 
 We knew who we were, what we wanted, where we were going, who were enemies and friends, but now... 
 Is there no turning back? 
 No. 
 The path's too narrow to turn. 
 Each decision's a stride forward, it cannot be revoked. 
 What's your greatest fear? 
 To be alone. 
 You'll never be alone. 
 Spoken by a true friend. 
 Well, I do my best. 
 (Chuckling) 
 To things and people we left behind. 
 And to a brighter future.
