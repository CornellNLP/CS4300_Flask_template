 Previously on The Affair... 
 It says here Lucifer is the card of temptation. 
 Something is coming. Something powerful, wild. 
 I'm Noah, by the way. 
 I'm Alison. 
 I'm sorry. I-I didn't know your wife's birthday. 
 Some guy came around here looking for you. 
 Who? 
 I don't know who he was. Waited for a while and then put a note on the board. 
 Do you have a secret, Detective? One you don't even want to tell yourself? 
 How would I know if I did? 
 I think you do. I think everybody does. 
 Listen, I had no idea she was married when I first met her. How would I have known? She never mentioned it. 
 Are you sisters? 
 In-law. We're married to brothers. 
 He wants to f*ck one of us. 
 I'll reschedule the meeting with Harry. 
 No, don't. 
 Dad, you're on child care this morning. 
 Tell me about this book of yours. 
 So how is it different? 
 He kills her... in the end. 
 You can't rush me. 
 But I want to be in charge, okay? 
 Kiss me.

 I thought you did a really nice job, little man. 
 I just had a couple of thoughts. 
 Uh, well, there's no, uh, thesis statement in the first paragraph. 
 Well, what are you trying to say exactly... 
 that Mark Twain did intend Huck Finn to be racist or not? 
 Okay, well, you need to say that. 
 Also, first paragraph, uh, you're confusing metaphor and simile. 
 Simile's the one with "like." 
 Mr. Solloway, would you mind? 
 I just have a few more questions. 
 Listen, Trevor, I got to go. 
 I'll call you back tonight. 
 Okay. I love you too. 
 Okay, bye. 
 That your kid? 
 Yeah. 
 I have a couple myself... twin boys. 
 I barely ever see them. 
 My wife got full custody in the divorce. 
 Ferry to Block Island is now leaving. 
 [Ferry horn blares] 
 All right, man, 2 coffees, 4 bucks. 
 Thanks. 
 Thank you. 
 Sir. 
 You forgot your change. 
 Thanks, man. 
 No problem. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Alison. 
 Oh, hi. 
 Hi. 
 How are you? 
 I was just thinking about you. 
 Oh. 
 No, I went to the market. 
 I picked up a little something for you. 
 How sweet of you. 
 [Both continue indistinctly] 
 [Smooches] Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Where to, Professor? 
 Well, I want to see the lighthouse. 
 I've heard that's really something. 
 And there's a historical society. 
 Might have some interesting material. 
 Well, maybe we should start by buying you a new shirt. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 "Dirty Squid"? 
 Seems appropriate. 
 Thanks. Thanks for that. 
 What about this? 
 Yeah, I like it. 
 Try it on. 
 Hey, do you have this in a... uh, in a small? 
 I don't think it's... 
 No, but we have this in a small. 
 Oh, yeah, that'll do. 
 Okay. 
 The dressing room's just right around there. 
 Okay. 
 After you. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Hey. Can you come in here for a second? 
 I need help with my dress. 
 Sure. 
 Tie around? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How do I look? 
 [Knock at door] 
 How's it going in there, Miss? 
 Do you need any help? 
 No, I'm fine. Thank you. 
 [Bicycle bell rings] 
 It says here, when it was built in 1875, the light was the strongest on the East Coast, and it's one of only 12 lighthouses in the country still equipped with a first-order Fresnel lens. 
 Impressive. 
 No, no. The Fresnel lens is incredible. 
 Fresnel was this French physicist who had the idea to take a glass lens and cut grooves in it in concentric circles. 
 And each groove acts like a prism that refracts the source light and concentrates it into a beam that can be seen much further away using a much thinner piece of glass. 
 And the first-order lens, which is what this is, is the biggest one 'cause it's got a prismatic dome on top. 
 You can see it from, like, 30 miles. 
 I'm sorry. This sh1t really interests me. 
 I can tell. 
 I'll just stop talking. 
 No. 
 It's great to hear. 
 Get anything of what I said? 
 No. [Laughs] 
 But it doesn't matter. 
 I understand that you're describing something that you love. 
 It certainly is beautiful. 
 Three? 
 Yes. 
 Three? 
 You see, this is why I didn't want to tell you. 
 I knew you'd make fun of me. 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 You're right. 
 But three, like the number that comes after two? 
 Okay, okay. 
 You know that's basically a virgin, right? 
 You do know that? 
 What do you want from me? I told you. 
 I met Helen the first year of college. 
 I've never been unfaithful. 
 What about high school? 
 I didn't f*ck anyone in high school. 
 What, because you were on the chess team? 
 [Laughs] 
 No, 'cause my, uh... my mother was sick. 
 With what? 
 She had M.S. 
 She died when I was 17. 
 Wow. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 It was pretty all-consuming. 
 I couldn't bring anyone home, and... 
 I felt guilty whenever I was away, so... 
 I slept for most of high school. That's what I did for fun. 
 How about you? How many? 
 Thousands. 
 Are they both dead? 
 No. 
 My grandmother's still alive. 
 She's in a home on the North Shore. 
 I wish she was closer, but I couldn't afford to put her anywhere in the Hamptons. 
 But, you know, I get to see her once a week, so it isn't too bad. 
 She has Alzheimer's. 
 Man, that's the worst. 
 No, it's not the worst. 
 But it's not great. 
 And your mom... where's she? 
 [Sighs] I never really know. 
 She's like the wind. She goes where she wants. 
 She does what she wants. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well... here we are... [Chuckles] my favorite spot on the island. 
 They're called the Mohegan Bluffs, 'cause in the 16th century, when the Mohegan Indians tried to invade the island, the native Niantic pushed them back over this cliff and to their death. 
 Jesus. 
 [Chuckles] 
 My grandfather used to bring me out here when I was a kid. 
 He was a bit of a shipwreck fanatic. 
 There's one right out there, past the break. 
 And sometimes when the tide is low, you can still see the tip of the mast. 
 We used to come down here and would pretend it was Neverland, and Peter Pan and the Lost Boys were on the shipwreck, and I was Tiger Lily, waiting for them on the beach. 
 My grandfather used to say, if I listened closely to the wind, I would hear Peter calling for me. 
 Sounds like a nice man, your grandfather. 
 He really was. 
 He was something else. 
 What now, friend? 
 So how's the writing going? 
 It's pretty good, actually. [Clears throat] 
 I finished the first chapter this week. 
 Wow. You did? 
 Yeah, I sent the pages over to Bruce's editor. 
 And what did he say? 
 Uh, he hasn't responded. 
 It's probably not a good sign. 
 Well, maybe he hasn't read 'em yet. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 I should never have sent them. 
 Stupid thing to do. 
 You don't send the first draft of the first chapter. 
 I don't know why I did it. 
 [Sighs] 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Of course. 
 Are you a good person? 
 What? 
 Do you consider yourself a good person? 
 No. 
 No? 
 No. 
 No, I don't believe there are good people and bad people. 
 I mean, yeah, there's rapists, sociopaths, but beyond that, I think we're all just doing our best to get by. 
 [Sighs] 
 I've never cheated on Helen. 
 I mean, it's not that I haven't wanted to. 
 Of course I have. I just... 
 I could never convince myself it was worth it. 
 What do you want me to say, Noah, that I'm worth it? 
 I'm probably not. 
 Do you have an open relationship with your husband? 
 No, definitely not. 
 You ever cheated on him? 
 No. 
 So why me? Why... why now? 
 I don't know. 
 You've got a nice ass. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Why you? 
 [Ringing continues] 
 I like you. 
 I like everything about you. 
 I like the way you talk. I like the way you think. 
 I don't even care what you're saying. 
 I just like listening to you. 
 And... 
 I like it when you touch me. 
 I want to know what it feels like to be underneath you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm sorry. I'm terrible at this. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Do you need to get that? 
 Yeah. 
 [Ringing continues] 
 Hello? 
 No, no, I'm on... I'm on Block Island. 
 I did tell you. 
 There's a lighthouse here I wanted to check out for my research. 
 What do you mean she's acting strange? 
 I don't know, Helen. 
 I think your mom's always strange. 
 Well, do you think she's sick? 
 So take her to the hospital. 
 Helen, I'm on Block Island. What do you want me to do? 
 Uh, the ferry doesn't leave till 5:00. 
 I'll be home, 6:30, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, I love you too. 
 We'll figure it out when I get home, okay? 
 Bye. 
 Coming here was your idea. 
 I know. 
 Whenever you're ready. 
 Where you going? 
 Hey. 
 Hey! Wait! 
 When's the next ferry leave? 
 There's a ferry for Connecticut leaving in five minutes. 
 Perfect. I'll get on it. 
 Here. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm leaving. 
 But... how are you gonna get home from Connecticut? 
 I'll work it out. 
 Stop. 
 Stop it. 
 This is complicated for me, Alison. 
 I realize it all seems pretty simple to you, but I try to live my life above board. 
 If I have s*x with you, then... 
 If you have s*x with me? 
 Whose... whose hand was in my underwear last week? 
 Well, that's not the same thing. 
 Of course it is. 
 Okay, okay, okay. Maybe it is. 
 But... but maybe... maybe I'm having second thoughts. 
 Can we just... can we just sit down for a moment? 
 Let me explain to you. 
 No. 
 What do you mean no? 
 I don't want to be your test case, Noah, so you can prove to yourself just how much you love your wife. 
 I want you. 
 I've made that very clear, and I thought you wanted me too. 
 Now, if you want a research partner, then... go find someone else. 
 You really want to go to Connecticut? 
 [Ferry horn blares] 
 I've got a cousin in New London. 
 She'll drive me home. 
 Okay. 
 See you around, Alison. 
 Hello? 
 Oh, can I help you? 
 Yeah, I was hoping to take a look around. 
 Oh, a patron. 
 Let me just find the maps to the museum. 
 I think we have a mutual friend... 
 Alison, Alison Lockhart. 
 How do you know Alison? 
 Oh, we just met. She's a... she's a friend of my wife's. 
 Where did they meet? 
 Yoga. 
 [Laughs] I could never understand yoga. 
 In my day, if you wanted to twist yourself into a pretzel, you got into bed with someone. 
 You didn't lie on a mat and stick your heinie in the air. 
 You ask me, the reason people are so miserable nowadays is because they're all doing yoga when they should be having s*x. 
 Right, well, f*ck the maps. 
 Uh, the museum is not that large. 
 Go right through there. 
 Thank you. 
 What do I, uh... what do I owe you? 
 Oh, nothing. Nothing. 
 Friend of Alison's. 
 Thank you. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Oh, hey, Harry. 
 No, no, no, no, this isn't a bad time. 
 I'm on Block Island. I'm doing some research. 
 You did? 
 What do you think? 
 Oh, that's great. 
 No, I-I know they were a little rough, but I wanted you to get a sense of the... 
 [Chuckles] 
 That's great. 
 Okay, I will. 
 You too. 
 Thanks. 
 You got anything with horses on it? 
 My daughter is obsessed. 
 You know, you just missed your wife. 
 My wife? 
 Yeah, she was in here just a minute ago. 
 [Door opens] 
 Hey, I forgot my... 
 I've been looking for you. 
 Uh, I need a room, please. 
 Uh, let me see what we have available. You're in luck. We've got a cancellation. This is an excellent room for $250. Will that be cash or credit? 
 Uh... do you have an ATM? 
 How much do you need? 
 $50. 
 Yeah, I got it. There. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Keys clacking, mouse clicks] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Keys jingle] 
 
 
 
 I don't want to hurt you. 
 Me? 
 I'm never gonna leave my wife. 
 I don't expect you to. 
 She can never find out. 
 I understand. 
 You still want to do this? 
 Yes. 
 We don't know anything about each other. 
 Well, let's keep it that way. 
 I could be wanted in four states. 
 [Chuckles] I'll take my chances. 
 God, you're so beautiful... 
 Noah. 
 Stop talking. 
 [Both moaning] 
 Oh, f*ck. I think I f*cking came. 
 [Both moaning] 
 Oh, God. 
 [Sighing] 
 Do not freak out. 
 Hey, what are you doing? 
 Just getting dressed. 
 Can that wait? 
 Sure. [Chuckles] 
 I take it you're not much of a cuddler. 
 No, not really. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 You seem a little upset. 
 No, I'm just... 
 It's just... it's just kind of stuffy in here, isn't it? 
 So let's open a window. 
 [Shutters open] 
 Is that better? 
 You can take a break. 
 Thank you. 
 Pick up. Pick up. 
 Pick up, come on. 
 Oh, damn it. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm at the f*cking police station being interrogated. 
 [Chuckles] I'm almost done. 
 Just... 
 Take your time. 
 [Sighs] 
 I met my wife in a parking lot... true story. 
 She put a dent in my bumper, and the rest is history. 
 How long have you been married? 
 25 years, and we still act like we're newlyweds. 
 Hmm. That's beautiful, Detective. 
 Shall we? 
 Yeah, just... 
 How'd you learn to swim? 
 Uh, there was a lake in the town where I grew up. 
 Where was that? 
 Western Pennsylvania... little town called St. George. 
 Is that Amish country? 
 Coal, actually. Well, not anymore. 
 Now they're all fracking and lighting their faucets on fire, I think. 
 I haven't been back in a while. 
 So you still have family there? 
 I do... my father. 
 Why do you ask? 
 What kind of lake was it? 
 A wet one. 
 Was it cold? 
 Yes. 
 Was it big? 
 Not particularly. 
 How old were you? 
 Uh... 
 I don't know. I guess I was pretty young. 
 They say this beach is haunted. 
 You see where it gets dark suddenly? 
 It looks like a whirlpool... right out there, about 100 yards out. 
 Yeah. 
 It's a shipwreck. 
 No kidding. 
 Yeah. 
 This island is famous for them. 
 Huh. Seems like such a pleasant place. 
 They say if you, um... if you listen closely to the wind... you can hear the sound of a little boy who died on the ship calling for his mother. 
 Jesus. 
 There's no wind today. 
 I've... I've heard it before. 
 You don't have to believe me, but I have. 
 No, I believe you. 
 I still hear my mother's voice. 
 I still talk to her. 
 It started right after she died. 
 I... 
 I'd be on my way to school or going to sleep at night, and... 
 What does she say? 
 That's the crazy thing. 
 I don't know what she's saying. 
 I hear her voice, and I know she's trying to tell me something, but... they're just sounds, not words. 
 It's like she's... speaking in the language of the dead... and I can't understand it. 
 I think she's saying something like, uh... 
 "let it go"? 
 It sounds a little like "let it go." 
 I can't work you out. 
 [Chuckles] 
 It's about an hour before the boat leaves. 
 Are there any other incredibly depressing places you want to tour before we go? 
 No. 
 I mean, an old graveyard or... check if there's an old gallows in town. 
 You want to check it out? 
 Screw you. 
 Now, that's a much better idea. 
 [Laughs] 
 Ah! 
 You didn't come last time, did you? 
 It's okay. 
 It's not okay. 
 I want to make you come. 
 Is there a trick? 
 A trick? 
 Yeah, like some secret thing that turns you on? 
 What, like something kinky? 
 Is there? 
 No. 
 Are you sure we have time? 
 f*ck time. 
 If we miss the last ferry, we'll have to sleep here. 
 Yes, let's f*cking sleep here. 
 And what about your family? 
 Don't you have some kind of emergency you got to go to? 
 In my family, there's always an emergency and therefore never an emergency. 
 Let me do that. 
 I love doing that. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 [Laughs] 
 One-handed. Still got it. 
 [Laughs] 
 Relax. 
 It tickles. 
 What's this? 
 Oh, no. Nothing. 
 Look, we haven't got time. We have to go. 
 Wait a second. Alison... 
 Can you hand me my dress? 
 Not yet... 
 Hand me my f*cking dress, please. 
 Okay, did I just do something wrong? 
 No. 
 Tell me. 
 I'm fine. 
 I don't understand what just happened. 
 What just happened is you f*cked someone who isn't your wife, Noah. 
 That's what happened. 
 That's what you did wrong. 
 If you want to apologize to someone, go and apologize to her. 
 How'd you get those scars on your leg? 
 You can trust me, Alison. 
 Trust you? 
 Are you insane? 
 Why would I do that? 
 You're a married man with four kids who's cheating on his wife. 
 f*ck! [Kicks dresser] 
 [Door opens and slams] 
 f*ck. 
 [Sighs] sh1t. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Grunts] 
 Get on the other end of this. 
 Why? What... 
 Just do it, okay? 
 Please. 
 What are we doing? 
 On the count of three, ready? 
 We push. One, two, three, go. 
 Push. 
 [Groans] 
 Please. 
 Where are we going? 
 Shh. 
 The maid's cleaning the floor. She left the room open. 
 Here. 
 Push. 
 [Sighs] You got to be kidding me. 
 Come on. 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 What about the people who stayed here? 
 They've left already. 
 No, they'll be charged for the damage. 
 Look, I haven't got any cash to pay for the damage. 
 Helen checks the credit card statements. 
 So, unless you want to pay for it, will you please help me get this thing out of the room before the f*cking maid comes back? 
 [Sighs] 
 Come on. 
 Ow. 
 [Both grunt] 
 Oh, f*ck it. 
 Ah. Ow. 
 Push. 
 Whoa. [Laughter] 
 Shh. 
 Shh. 
 There. 
 Perfect. 
 Nice work, Bonnie. Let's go. 
 [Ferry horn blares] 
 I'm sorry. 
 I didn't mean those things that I said. 
 They were true. 
 Okay, well, I... 
 I didn't mean to say them. 
 [Chuckles] 
 We should end this... here, now. 
 You know, we've had such a nice day, and we should just leave it in a good place, okay? 
 If that's what you want. 
 Look, I-I-I know what you think you see. 
 Tell me. 
 Well, some easygoing girl who's gonna shake you up with her free spirit, so by the end of the summer, you can go back home to your boring life with a bounce in your step. 
 Well, I wish you'd at least give me the chance to disappoint you. 
 Yeah, well, I'm not that girl. 
 And I won't rescue you from anything. 
 You're gonna be sorry you ever met me. 
 We just leave it here, okay? 
 You got to have your little adventure, and I got to... 
 Okay, just stop it. Just stop talking, all right? 
 You're making me sick. 
 Well, what do you think happens now? 
 What do you want from me? 
 Some kind of promise that I'll divorce my wife? 
 Of course not. 
 Are you planning on leaving your husband? 
 No. 
 Then why are we even arguing? 
 I don't know what the hell happened back there, but let me make one thing very clear. 
 There is nothing about you that seems easy. 
 And whatever darkness you think you're hiding, it's written all over your f*cking face. 
 And you know what? 
 I kind of like it. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Engine turning over, car doors closing] 
 [Car horn honks] 
 Damn it. 
 You forgot my wife's birthday? 
 Ha. 
 So that's it, then? Just see you around? 
 I had a nice time today. 
 And sorry I was clumsy or... 
 I... 
 It meant something to me, being there with you. 
 I just wanted you to know that. 
 Thank you for taking me there. 
 [Voice breaking] Damn it. 
 Alison, why are you shaking? 
 Come on, I'll drive you home. 
 No. 
 Yes, yes. 
 Come on, you're a mess. Let me just make sure you get home okay, and you don't have to say a word to me. 
 Then at least I'll have done one decent thing today. 
 Come on. 
 Don't give me that face. 
 Come on, get in the car. 
 I had a son. 
 "Had"? 
 He drowned. 
 Oh, God. 
 [Sighs] 
 When? 
 Two years ago. 
 [Sighs] 
 How old was he? 
 Four. 
 He'd be six now. 
 He'd be learning to read. 
 What was his name? 
 Gabriel. 
 What was he like? 
 He... he was perfect. 
 God, he had these... he had these wide, green eyes... and he thought everything was funny. 
 [Laughs] 
 He never wanted to be left out of a joke. 
 When I wake up, before I open my eyes, I... 
 I listen for his laugh... because I'd gotten so used to hearing it, you know? 
 That's how every morning started for so long. 
 I'd wake up, and he'd be standing there at the bed, looking at me and laughing. 
 He thought it was so funny that grown-ups sleep too. 
 Now when I open my eyes, my house is so quiet. 
 Cole has this tattoo on his back of the Angel Gabriel. 
 It's the first thing I see every f*cking morning, and it all comes rushing back, and I want to die. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 So now you know. 
 And, yes... 
 I cut myself once in a while because it makes me feel better. 
 I'll understand if I never see you again. 
 I'll take you home. 
 [Engine turning over] 
 Where is Cole? 
 He went to Syracuse to pick up a new horse. 
 He won't be back till tomorrow night. 
 Uh, I need my bike. [Chuckles] 
 Right. 
 Idiot. 
 Right here? 
 Thanks. 
 Noah... thank you... for today. 
 I'm... I'm sorry if I... 
 No, no, no. Don't apologize. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Anything. 
 What do you see now... when you look at me? 
 What do you think I see? 
 Death. 
 No. 
 What do you see, then? 
 You don't want this. 
 Alison, I'm a grown man. I know what I want. 
 [Both breathing heavily] 
 Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. 
 [Both moaning]
