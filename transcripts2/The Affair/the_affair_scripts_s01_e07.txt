 Previously on The Affair... 
 Whitney is part of a group of kids that have been bullying Jody online. 
 What? 
 She wants us to go in there with her. 
 Where? To... To therapy? 
 Mr. Solloway, do you know a place called "The End"? 
 No, what is it? 
 It's a club out in Montauk. 
 Both : Uncle Max! 
 I didn't know you invited Max. 
 Helen the felon. 
 Hello. 
 Come here. 
 You're never going to be successful if you only write one book a decade. 
 I'm never going to be successful? 
 That's not what I said. 
 You owe me money, Hodges. 
 You owe me a permit, asshole. 
 [Indistinct whispering] 
 Oscar called the police. 
 How do you know? 
 'Cause I was there. I saw him do it. 
 Cole, we need to dump this sh1t, throw it in the ocean. 
 Why don't you go back to the ranch? 
 Find someplace on the edge of the property, someplace discreet, make sure nobody's watching. 
 Dig a hole. I'll bring the check. 
 You take Hal with you. 
 I'm telling you, man, if you bury it, someone's going to find it. 
 Hal, Hal, please, please. 
 You deal f*cking coke? 
 Do you know how stupid that is? 
 I thought about what you said before, and I-I don't want that life anymore. 
 After today, I'd have to be insane to keep this going.

 Thank you for coming in. 
 Because it's our last session out here, I thought it was a good opportunity to check in, so Whitney can share some feelings which have been difficult for her. 
 Okay, so, in terms of, like, why this thing happened... 
 I mean, I definitely didn't understand the gravity of the situation. 
 But I have been extremely stressed because mom is... 
 Address her directly. 
 Okay, because you do put an extreme amount of pressure on me. 
 I-I don't. I-I give you... 
 Let her speak, please. 
 You do, actually. 
 To be totally fine and okay all the time, completely together. 
 You know, nobody can be upset for more than five seconds with you. 
 It's the whole way you are. 
 Like, even with dad, you act like you guys are this perfect couple when you guys are clearly having some serious issues. 
 Look, no marriage is perfect. 
 Whitney, let's stay focused on your feelings. 
 Well, I feel like dad is miserable. 
 What? 
 No, because mom is clearly having some kind of affair. 
 What? 
 Wait, what? 
 We're still not allowed to talk? 
 Look, that is so not true. 
 You're not having some kind of thing with Max? 
 Max? 
 Max? 
 You're way off here, Whitney. 
 No. 
 Whitney, could you step into the waiting room? 
 I'd like to speak to your mom and dad privately. 
 Which is the waiting room? 
 Oh, right, sorry. 
 I forgot we're not in my office. 
 Um, how about the kitchen? Or the hall? 
 Whichever's more comfortable for you. 
 [Sighs] 
 So, um... 
 I'm hearing that Whitney's observations are not ringing true to you? 
 No. 
 Not at all. 
 Okay. 
 Sometimes when a child is acting out, it can be the expression of other crises in the family system. 
 I'm wondering if you... well, the two of you might be interested in doing some work as a couple. 
 Not with me but with a trusted colleague. 
 Thanks, but we really don't need that kind of work, so... 
 I think it would help Whitney. 
 [Sighs] 
 Let's leave today. 
 It's only Tuesday. 
 [Sighs] 
 It's time to go home. 
 Okay. 
 I'm staying till Sunday. 
 No, you're not. 
 That was the plan, and that's what I'm calibrated for. 
 Yeah, well, get un-calibrated and start packing, now. 
 My nails are wet. 
 I'll do it. 
 No, she can do it. Where does this picture go? 
 Right there. 
 Whitney, why would you say something like that to your therapist? 
 Why do you think? 
 I think it's difficult for you to accept responsibility for what you did to Jody. 
 I think that you're deflecting the situation. 
 Why do you keep denying my reality? 
 I'm not denying your reality. 
 Yes, you... 
 Stop touching my clothes. 
 Jesus Christ, I am trying to help you. 
 I'm... 
 Hey, can someone drive me to the Ranch? 
 I want to say good-bye. 
 You said good-bye. 
 No, I didn't. 
 I was going to say good-bye this weekend, and now you're making us leave early. 
 Oh, so first you didn't want to come, and now you don't want to leave? 
 I have to make an apology. 
 Apologize? For what? 
 Just... I made a mistake with a horse. 
 So just... just write a letter. 
 Okay? It's more polite. 
 No, he wants to accept responsibility for something. 
 Why don't you just run him over there? 
 No! I got things to do... 
 No? What... 
 You do it. I'll pack the kids up. 
 It'll take you, like, 20 minutes. 
 [Background chatter] 
 [Horses neighing in the distance] 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Cole, um... 
 I wanted to say sorry about the horse. 
 Yeah, that was crazy. 
 What happened? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, we got her back, so it's all okay. 
 We're leaving. Today. 
 Back to Brooklyn, huh? 
 Yeah. I just wish we lived out here. 
 Well, Martin, you were a great hand. 
 We will miss you. 
 I'll tell you what, I'll make you a deal. 
 If you do good in school this year, next summer when you come back, we'll make sure we keep a space open for you, how's that sound? 
 All right. 
 Hal's out back if you want to say good-bye. 
 Great kid you got there. 
 Thanks. 
 I'd keep an eye on him. 
 Seems like he's kind of hungry for attention. 
 Sure, like... like any teenage boy. 
 [Fence creaks] 
 Martin, we gotta go. 
 I'll go get him. 
 That's it? 
 What? 
 Let's go. 
 I want to be out of here fast, so get yourself packed up, okay? 
 Oh, no performance art. 
 I knew you were irrational. 
 Irrational, how dare you? 
 How dare I? 
 Imply I had some kind of agenda. 
 You're saying she came up with this herself? 
 I could sue her! 
 You guys, it's just a stupid magazine article. 
 She merely observed the truth. 
 What, that you write my books? 
 Just that I help a great deal. Collaborate, even. 
 Collaborate my ass! 
 Okay, just try writing one on your own. 
 I've already written 17! 
 You poor, deluded b*st*rd. 
 Oh, go to hell. 
 Total shitstorm. 
 A profile came out on my dad in Vanity Fair today. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 I have to see it. 
 You have to see it. 
 "His wife, seemingly worn from years of unacknowledged efforts as his first editor and frequent rewriter." 
 [Laughs] 
 Amazing. 
 I know, he's livid. He might actually kill her. 
 Maybe we shouldn't leave. 
 I'm kidding. Jesus, maybe you might kill me. 
 "She appeared to have soothed Butler's overwrought sentences into the genteel prose of his better work." 
 [Laughs] Oh, my God. 
 I have never seen you this happy in 25 years of knowing you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Glass shatters] 
 Great, smash my Venetian glass, you selfish son of a bitch. 
 I'm selfish? 
 Who paid for all this sh1t? 
 Come on, go. 
 But I'm loving this. 
 Shh, come on, let's go. 
 At least Louis Seize was faithful. 
 Uh-oh. 
 See, that's what happens when you don't apologize for 50 years. 
 And force them to print a retraction. 
 Hey, you finish packing. I'll get gas. 
 Intolerable! 
 End of the summer, huh? 
 sh1t. 
 Heading back to Gotham soon? 
 Sure am, today, actually. 
 Looks like you got away with it. 
 You know what I just realized? 
 I could tell your wife. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Yeah, you do. 
 But I'll tell you what, how about 10 grand to make sure Helen never finds out, huh? 
 You kidding me? 
 I know, it's sudden. I just thought of it. 
 [Car door closes] [Engine starts] 
 I don't have that kind of money. 
 Yeah? Well, I think you can get it. 
 So I'll give you a week, and then I'll tell her. 
 Have a safe trip. I got your cell. 
 Thank you so much, Mom. 
 And this beautiful face. 
 What am I going to do when I can't see it every day? 
 You can skype, Grandma. 
 I can't, and I won't. 
 But I love you, my brilliant boy. 
 Why don't you guys get in the car? 
 Bye, Grandma. 
 Bye, honey. 
 Is dad going to say good-bye? 
 Well, wouldn't be dramatic enough, now, would it? 
 Are you sure you're going to be okay? 
 Do you want to come with us? 
 Leave him to hole up with his mistress? 
 I don't think so. 
 What? 
 Hey, did you see... 
 We're out of here. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Everything's better now? 
 Yes. 
 [Kids chattering] 
 Next year let's just go camping. 
 You hate camping. 
 Yes. 
 But they have these luxury tents now with beds and rugs. 
 It's called "glamping." 
 I would do that. 
 My spoon, my fork. 
 You don't need those. 
 It's pizza. 
 I missed them. 
 It's so nice to be able to talk while I'm eating again. 
 sh1t. 
 They totally screwed up this pan. 
 It's all rusted. 
 Banister's chipped on the stairs too. 
 f*ck. 
 Mom. 
 Sorry. Why are renters such animals? 
 That's what the deposit's for. 
 This banister's irreplaceable. 
 Hey. 
 We clear our own plates here, remember? 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 This is weird. 
 Hmm. 
 [Sighs] 
 It's okay, you're tired. 
 I know, but I'm not that tired. 
 Maybe your age is catching up to your legendary hard-on. 
 [Laughs] 
 Legendary? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Where? 
 Right here. 
 Right here, in this bedroom. 
 Legend. 
 [Both sigh] 
 So happy we're home. 
 Me too. 
 [Phone chimes] 
 Yes, but... 
 I... 
 That's right, that's right. 
 Uh-huh, yeah. 
 We just wanted to confirm those trades. 
 Uh-huh, Qualcomm, right. 
 Uh-huh. [Laughs] 
 Absolutely, we will golf. Bye now. 
 Hey, you look like sh1t, man. 
 Thanks, man. 
 You look like 5 million bucks. 
 Totes. 
 f*cking a 23-year-old, so... 
 Ah, here we go. 
 Let's get it. [Grunts] 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Getting huge, obviously. What are you doing? 
 God Almighty, I'm strong. 
 I need a big favor. 
 Anything. Maybe. 
 What? 
 It's money. 
 Okay, how much? 
 Oh, sh1t, that much, huh? 
 10 grand. 
 Wow, that's... real money. Need a new roof or something? 
 Yeah. 
 Noah, come on, man. 
 Can't help you out unless you tell me what it's for. 
 I'm being blackmailed. 
 What? 
 Dude. 
 Why? 
 I had an affair. It's over now. 
 Wait, you? 
 No. 
 Someone knows. He's scum. 
 He's threatened to tell Helen. 
 Well, we can't let Helen know. 
 [Clears throat] 
 I'll pay you back. 
 Stop. 
 Listen to me. 
 Just... whatever you do, don't get all sensitive and tell Helen to make yourself feel better. 
 That will help no one. 
 I won't. 
 [Exhales] 
 f*ck you. 
 Thanks, man. 
 [Panting] 
 [Groaning] 
 Maybe you're anemic. 
 Shortness of breath, dizziness? 
 Really felt like my heart. 
 Yeah, but you seem okay now. 
 They said it might be a heart attack. 
 You know, you're not going to make her come back by looking for her. 
 Well, she is, so I did. 
 Mr., uh, Solloway. 
 Yes? 
 Good news, the test came back negative for any cardiac event. 
 [Sighs] 
 Do you think he's anemic? 
 Uh, no, the blood work was normal. 
 It seems like it was just a panic attack. 
 Panic attack? You sure? 
 I mean, it really felt like my heart. 
 They can. 
 About 20% of visits to the E.R. are panic attacks. 
 They're caused by stress. 
 Stress? Come on. 
 We just got back from vacation. 
 Do you have kids? 
 Four. 
 Then you have stress. 
 If it happens again, see a therapist. 
 You can check out now. 
 It really was a stressful summer. 
 It was awful, really, with my dad and Whitney, and I'm sorry I made you go there again. 
 I'm sorry I make you go there every year. 
 I'm sorry we can't afford to go anywhere else. 
 Well, let's just do it. 
 Let's just go away, the two of us, and my mom can watch the kids for a weekend, and we'll just be together and... and decompress. 
 Helen, I... 
 Uh-oh. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I was so stupid. 
 sh1t. 
 And it was nothing. 
 I wanted just to pretend it never happened, 'cause it meant nothing, but... 
 I-I-I can't... 
 I can't keep it from you. I... 
 [Sighs] 
 I had a fling this summer. 
 A fling? 
 So what, like, once? 
 A few times. 
 Uh, with who? 
 It doesn't matter... 
 The waitress? 
 Alison? 
 I knew it. 
 You know, I f*cking knew it. 
 How long? 
 Not long. 
 How long? 
 A few weeks. 
 Like, three? 
 No. 
 Five? 
 Maybe eight. 
 Eight. 
 Wow, eight. 
 The whole f*cking summer. 
 That makes me feel sick. 
 I am so sorry. 
 He's okay. 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 Daddy! 
 Dad. 
 Ooh, ay-yi-yi. 
 [Murmurs] 
 I'm fine, you guys. I'm fine. 
 Are you wounded, Daddy? 
 No, no, no, not at all. Look, no blood. 
 Was it a stroke? 
 No, I just went for a run. 
 And I got dehydrated, so I got dizzy. 
 Which is a good reminder to everybody to drink lots of water when it's this hot out. 
 You went to the hospital for being dizzy? 
 Whitney should be in the hospital all the time then. 
 [Laughs] 
 No, I fainted. Come on, I'm fine now. 
 Mommy, come in. 
 Hillary Clinton fainted because she was dehydrated once. 
 Yes. It was exactly like that. 
 What are you doing? 
 I didn't want us on display. 
 Uh, I really don't know how to process this. 
 Part of me wants you to walk me through every moment, um... of what happened because it happened to you and... 
 I always know everything that happens to you. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Um, don't I? 
 I mean, I-I did, I think. 
 Yes. 
 Yes. So it's... um, it's just that you lied to me for eight weeks. 
 Eight... probably longer, you know, when you were thinking about it. 
 Haven't you ever thought about it? 
 You know, this is not about what I may have thought of. 
 Please. 
 Leon? 
 You knew about Leon. 
 It was not some... some... some deep hidden thing. 
 Well, I only knew about it because it was obvious, not because you told me. 
 Nothing happened! 
 I'm just saying, we don't talk about everything. 
 So you're saying that what you did is because our marriage and our friendship is a lie? 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't know why I did it. 
 Well, what... what am I supposed to do with that? 
 What matters is, I stopped, because I love you and I love our life. 
 If you loved me and you loved our life, you would not have done it, because it is a destruction. 
 It is a destructive thing. For a waitress? 
 It was a very, very, very, very stupid thing. 
 Yeah. 
 I don't know, I've been going through something. 
 Not about you, it's about myself. 
 Seriously? 
 How old is she, 22? 
 Come on, what are you saying? 
 What, if she'd been a 50-year-old English professor, would that make this better? 
 f*ck you. 
 She was in a very dark place, and she came after me pretty hard. 
 Oh, my God, this is disgusting. 
 I was feeling weak, I guess. 
 I'd finally had a book published, took ten years, and it was just nothing. 
 Nobody read it. 
 People read it. 
 No one f*cking read it. 
 20 people read it. People I know. 
 And it got good reviews. 
 Yeah, and very bad reviews. 
 Then being around your dad with his billion books sold, and he sucks. I'm good. 
 At least I thought I was. Maybe I'm not. 
 And the pressure on this second book from you too. 
 I was trying to be supportive... 
 Maybe it just made me feel better to be seen as someone. 
 Something successful. 
 You just see me as potential unfulfilled. 
 You're waiting for the guy you married to... happen. 
 Only because you are. 
 Helen, I love you so much. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Phone chimes] 
 [Line rings] 
 Noah, been waiting for your call. 
 I told her, so you can go f*ck yourself. 
 [Birds calling] 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 The whole thing's rotten. We gotta replace it. 
 Well, maybe we should just repaint it. 
 Why? 
 Because it would look better. 
 No, it wouldn't. It would just look painted. 
 [Sighs] 
 Martin's been a great help around here. 
 Been really happy to have him around. 
 Martin, helpful? 
 You sure we're talking about the same kid? 
 You know, my impression is, he's just... hungry for attention. 
 Well, thanks for the parenting advice. 
 Why don't you get back to me when you have a teenage son? 
 Uh, sorry. Mr. Solloway, this is my wife, Alison. 
 Hi. I think... I think we met before. 
 You're a waitress at the Lobster Roll, right? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 Well, we'll see you next summer? 
 Yeah. Thanks a lot. 
 Come on, Martin! Let's go! 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Is he here? 
 No. 
 Did he put the checks on the board? 
 Of course not. 
 Ugh. 
 Oh, don't go back to New York. 
 Come live with me in my house. 
 Don't go back to your house. Come live with me in New York. 
 I wish I could. 
 You seem better this summer. 
 I guess. 
 [Sighs] Winter's rough, though. 
 [Sighs] Winter's so rough. 
 Even in Brooklyn. Visit me a lot. 
 We'll go to museums and just lady out. 
 [Chuckles] Okay, I will. 
 Hmm, Bailey. I thought you quit. 
 Can I get my last check, please? 
 You're kidding me, right? [Chuckles] 
 Get the f*ck out of here. 
 Fine. 
 I'll take these instead. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I got you some pies. 
 Yum. 
 Can I help in any way? 
 Can you go in the liquor cabinet and grab me some sherry? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll put these in the oven, keep 'em warm. 
 Okay. 
 I think we should lay low. 
 We're giving him what he wants. 
 We'll support his stupid bowling alley and move on. 
 Still think we should beat the sh1t out of him. 
 We're not thugs. 
 What if we just sell the rest of the stash back to the dealers? 
 [Laughs] Doesn't work that way, bro. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Oscar. 
 I think we should go over there and make peace tonight. 
 Let him know we support his plan, turn him into an ally. 
 There. 
 Thank you, dear. 
 Would you mind making a salad? 
 Not at all. 
 Did I ever tell you about Cole and the stroller? 
 Cole and the stroller? No. 
 I was just thinking about it for some reason. 
 What's the story? 
 One day, when he was really little, maybe a year, maybe less, I took him grocery shopping in his stroller... this was before the days when strollers had brakes... and I parked it up on the curb, which I didn't realize was on a slight incline. 
 And I turned away to load the groceries in, and the stroller started rolling into traffic. 
 I ran after it. I caught it. 
 Cole was fine. 
 He thought it was funny. 
 I was really shaken up by the whole thing. 
 When I thought about it later, it occurred to me, I was running after the stroller before I even had the conscious thought "it's rolling." 
 Some kind of instinct. 
 I tried to remember the first time that I saw it move, but the more I tried, the more I realized I hadn't. 
 What do you mean? 
 I was turned away. I hadn't seen anything. 
 I just knew somehow that he was in danger. 
 It still happens... with my boys. 
 I know when something is about to hurt one of them. 
 Who's Noah? 
 What? 
 [Paper rustling] 
 It was stuck to the bottom of the pie box. 
 I don't know. 
 Can I see it? 
 You're screwing around? 
 Cherry, please... 
 After everything he's done for you, everything we've all done for you. 
 Can I please just see what's in that note? Plea... 
 Cherry. 
 I want you to end it. 
 It's already done. 
 Good. 
 And you will never tell Cole. 
 Because you know that doing so is a selfish act. 
 You've been selfish enough already. 
 I'm going home. 
 No, you're not. 
 You're gonna stay for dinner. 
 You're gonna help me serve. 
 Use this one. 
 It's sharper. 
 [Chopping] 
 So who's your new girl, Scotty? 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I saw you down at the Ditch Witch the other day with some little brunette. 
 MK, if I had to keep track of every little brunette who tried to get in my pants, I'd have to hire a bookkeeper. 
 [Others groan] 
 Anyway, Mom, this food is great. 
 Thank you for cooking it. 
 My pleasure. 
 [Voices fade] 
 We're just here to apologize. Nothing else, got it? 
 Yep. Got it. 
 You want to wait in the car? 
 No. I'll come. 
 Oh. 
 To what do I owe this visit from such an esteemed family? 
 We're here to apologize. 
 I don't like change, but I don't like being at war with my neighbors either. 
 We all gotta do what we gotta do to survive out here, right? 
 Yeah, exactly. 
 So I'm gonna write you a letter of support. 
 And you are not gonna f*ck with us ever again. 
 Peace? 
 Yeah. All right, peace. 
 Okay, then. Good night. 
 Thanks for coming by, guys. 
 [Groans] 
 f*ck's sakes, Scotty. 
 Come on, man! 
 f*ck. 
 Get in the car. 
 Jesus. 
 You okay? 
 [Stammers] 
 Hey. 
 You ever ask her how she found out, huh? 
 Let's go. 
 Who told her I called the cops? 
 She saw you call the cops. 
 Cole, come on. 
 No, she didn't. 
 No, she wasn't even there. You know who was there? 
 The guy she's f*cking. 
 [Both grunting] 
 [Punches landing] 
 [Liquid pouring] 
 Do I know him? 
 No. 
 Is he from here? 
 No. 
 Good. 
 Then it's your problem. You deal with it. 
 I think I should go away for a few days. 
 Good idea. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 I can't believe Oscar knew this was happening before I did. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Laid-back music] 
 What do you think was in the note? 
 I have no idea. 
 Ugh. 
 I know this sounds crazy, but I... 
 I suddenly feel like he's my real life, and everything else, all the days I'm living through, are just a memory or something. 
 God, I'm high. 
 I'm really high. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Do you remember those giant Oreos we had when we were kids? 
 They were, like... like, as big as your face. 
 What happened to those? Did I... Did I dream them? 
 I don't think so. 
 I found his address. 
 Jesus, how? 
 Technology. 
 I'm emailing it to you. 
 You can just do that? 
 Yeah, for a little money. 
 [Phone chimes] 
 Do you wanna go? 
 No. 
 Fine. 
 How about his wife's store? 
 You found that too? 
 Yup. 
 It's not far from here. 
 Not going. 
 [Sighs] Alison... enough with the good girl act. 
 You're in love with a married man. 
 You want him to leave his wife and be with you, admit it. 
 No. No, that's not true. 
 Okay, fine. 
 I'm going to the store. 
 I gotta buy my mother a birthday gift. 
 You can just stay here and be fat. 
 Are you going now? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, wait. 
 [Bells jingle] 
 These are really cute. For my niece, huh? 
 Um, these light bulbs are amazing. 
 The light is really soft, it's almost incandescent. 
 And you don't have to replace them. 
 And they last for about 20 years, I'm not kidding. 
 I need those. A lot of them. 
 Okay. 
 Great. 
 Okay. 
 Hi. 
 Alison, right? 
 Hi. [Chuckles] Yeah. 
 What are... Do you... live in the city? 
 No, no, I'm, um... I'm just visiting, I... 
 I live in Montauk. 
 That's what I thought, yeah. 
 Um... did you just wander in here? [Laughs] 
 Uh... well, my friend is looking for a gift. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Can I help you with something? 
 I'm just browsing. 
 Okay. 
 Listen... 
 I never thanked you. 
 For what? 
 For what you did for my daughter the day she choked. 
 Oh. It was nothing. 
 No, it wasn't. 
 Helen, your husband's on the phone. 
 He says... 
 [Bells jingle] 
 Hey! 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah, I'm fine, I just... I just need to be alone. 
 Okay. See you back at the apartment? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Cole's here. 
 What? 
 What are you doing here? 
 I needed to talk to you. 
 I'm going to the store. [Keys jingle] 
 What? No. This is your apartment. 
 It's okay. I need something. 
 The coke is gone. 
 What do you mean? I... 
 I mean it's gone. 
 We buried it, we went to dig it up, and it wasn't there. 
 Who's the guy? 
 What? 
 Who else did you tell? 
 [Scoffs] Cole... 
 Who else knows about this? he didn't take your drugs. 
 How could you possibly know that? 
 He's not that kind of person. 
 Really? 
 He'd f*ck another man's wife, but he draws the line at theft? 
 Sounds like a regular Samaritan. 
 Do you understand how much money we just lost? 
 Yes, I... 
 Do you even care anymore? 
 Of course I care. 
 Good, then just tell me! 
 Who else knew? 
 Knew what, that we deal coke? 
 For Christ's sake, Cole, the whole town knew! 
 Oscar probably dug it up himself. 
 A-And I don't even know where you buried... 
 [Shouts] Why won't you just tell me who you're f*cking? 
 Noah Solloway. 
 Who the f*ck is No... 
 Martin's dad? 
 Why? 
 This place is like hell. 
 I kind of like it. 
 Do you smell that? 
 You'd have to have a death wish to want to live here. 
 Was it something I did? 
 No. 
 Oh, I feel like I'm gonna puke. 
 Don't sit on that. Don't, don't. 
 Don't get your dress dirty. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 When my dad died, I figured out this trick for dealing with the pain 'cause it'd come in waves, you know. 
 And just like a wave, eventually it'd pass, so... 
 I just... I'd start to count. 
 1, 2, 3, sometimes 20, sometimes 100. 
 One time I made it all the way up to 3,000. 
 I knew if I could just keep on counting that, eventually, it would pass. 
 So when... when Gabriel died, I tried that again. 
 Wake up in the middle of the night, and I'd be sweating, and I would just feel that darkness bearing down on me, and I would... 
 I'd try counting, but... this time it just wouldn't work. 
 It was just too dark, and I-I'd forget the numbers, forget what order they're supposed to come in, and the only thing... the only thing that made it better for me, made it so I could just breathe, just for a second, was you. 
 And I thought if we could just keep on moving forward... if we could just move forward that, eventually, everything was gonna get better. 
 [Sighs] 
 But it didn't get better. It just got worse. 
 Sometimes I wonder if it's him. 
 This is his way of telling us that if he can't be here, then we can't either. 
 No. 
 No, no, it's not him. 
 Sometimes I wonder. 
 [Phone chimes] 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 Something's happened to Hal. 
 How is he? 
 He's gonna be okay, they said. 
 Look at him. 
 [Sighs] 
 What the f*ck was he thinking? 
 Trying to give the drugs back to the dealers? 
 He was trying to neutralize our debt. 
 And what did he expect was gonna happen? 
 They were gonna write him a thank-you card and then cut him a goddamn check? 
 Cole. 
 How long is he gonna be here for? 
 The doctor says at least two more weeks, maybe a month. 
 We have to sell the Ranch. 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 We have no choice. 
 We just lost 100 grand. 
 Let me handle it. 
 No, Mom, you gotta stop with this... you can't just pretend like everything's all right and none of this happened. 
 I'll cover it. I'll get a loan from the bank. 
 No. I can't do this anymore. 
 This trouble isn't worth it. 
 Cole... 
 We can talk about this tomorrow. 
 We're going home. 
 You're leaving? 
 Your brother is in the hospital. 
 I can see that. 
 I'll be here first thing tomorrow morning, and I'll be here all day. 
 Can I help you? 
 I need to look at your register. 
 Okay. 
 Looking for the name Solloway. 
 Noah. 
 [Typing] 
 S-o-l-l-o-w-a-y? 
 That's right. 
 That name is not coming up. 
 Nothing? 
 No, he's... he's never stayed with us. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Ali. 
 I wanna start this part over again. 
 Let's make a baby.
