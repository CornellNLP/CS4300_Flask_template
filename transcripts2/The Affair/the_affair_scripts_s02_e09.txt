 Helen :  Previously on  The Affair... 
 Eden : Noah. 
 Need you. Excuse us. 
 Denise : Oh, please don't steal him, Eden. 
 Someone more important wants to talk to him. 
 I hate her. 
 She's just doing her job. 
 Cherry :  Our family is cursed, Cole. 
 This happens in families when something so evil has occurred. 
 You are not selling your grandparents' house. 
 Alison : The house is in escrow. 
 It's done. 
 Alison : You're really late. 
 My fault. Totally my fault. 
 Ah, Eden. Where's the turkey? 
 sh1t, I knew we forgot something. 
 I'll go get it right now. 
 No, it's closed. 
 Athena :  Noah, do you want to listen to your baby's heartbeat? 
 Alison :  Do you even want this baby? 
 Of course I do. 
 Cole :  I was trying to hurt you. 
 I was trying to get you out of my house, Te amo también. [both chuckle] Where were you all night? I don't mix business with this kind of pleasure. ♪ I was screaming into the canyon ♪

♪♪ male announcer :  We've got some traffic on the eastbound Lincoln Tunnel and two lanes closed on the Manhattan Bridge. But the big news right now is this hurricane warning. Yes, that's right. I said hurricane warning in effect in the tri-state area, Hurricane Alex, a category four right now, making its way up the Atlantic from the Gulf, however, not expected to make landfall. female announcer :  Okay, I don't know, Mike. A hurricane in March? Is this global warming? Mike :  I guess so, but hey, hopefully they're right... [siren wailing] You sure I can't get you anything else while you wait for your friend? He's not my friend, and it doesn't look like he's showing up. OkCupid? What? You're on an Internet date, right? Yes, I am. Um, but it's, um, Tinder. You know that? Yeah, I've heard of it. It's my first time. My daughter set the whole thing up for me, so... How old's your daughter? 18. That makes sense. Tinder is more of a hookup site for millennials. You should try match.com. That's usually where the divorcées hang out. Thanks for the tip. No problem. Can I get you anything else? Nope, this is great. Just the check, and here, you can just run that. Sure. Hey. Do I know you? Yeah. From where? [snaps fingers] I operated on your son. God. Dr. Ullah! Yeah. I'm sorry. It's such a different context. Hi. How's he doing? He's better. Um, he gained six pounds since the surgery. That's great. Mm-hmm. I've been meaning to follow up with you, just to get you some sort of thank-you. Come on, that isn't necessary. It's my job. No, but I want to. I just, I really... I wasn't sure what surgeons generally like. Alcohol. O... kay. Do you prefer red or white? I prefer whiskey. Okay. Wine doesn't get you drunk fast enough. Right. Whiskey, okay. Should I send that to the hospital, or... No. You got a pen? I'll give you my home address. Oh, thank you. Sure. Okay. It's 322 Lenox Avenue. You live in Harlem? Yep. What are you doing all the way out here? Well, I'm on call tonight at Brooklyn Central, but I was worried about the weather, so decided to come hang out down here in case I have to go in. I'll have another. How much have you had to drink? This? Oh, don't worry. This just loosens my joints. Hey, I hope you don't mind. I couldn't help eavesdropping. Were you here to meet a Tinder date? [sighs] [writes on paper] Yep. So married women do use Tinder. Fascinating. I'm not married. You're not? Not anymore. I'm shocked to hear that. Oh, really? I find that hard to believe since the last time you saw me you had a front-row seat to my divorce. Is that what was happening there? Yes, that's what was happening. We were in the middle of a horrible litigation, and he... it was... ...well, bad, but it's over now. Thank God. Very nice to see you. And I will, um... I'll get you that whiskey straightaway. You're leaving? Why? Yeah. Because I have to get back to my kids. 'Cause it's a little windy? waitress : Actually, we just got an emergency alert. The mayor is closing down the subways at 9 p.m. tonight. My manager just said we need to kick you all out, so we can go home. Helen : Okay, well, thanks again. And, uh, nice to see you. Wait. How about leaving me your number? Yeah... waitress : This is great, you guys, but can you do this part outside? Vik : Sure. [mouthing words] So can I have it? Your number. You're not gonna, like, ask me out on a date or anything, are you? I was thinking about it. It's a bad idea. You'll accept a date from some rando on the Internet, but you won't go out with me? I mean, what is a date, really? It's just an interview for s*x. Okay. Would you like to have s*x with me? Sure. Hi, guys. Hi, Mom. How was your meeting? It was good. Where's Martin? Trevor : In his room. And did Whitney leave already? Yeah, Chrissy came to pick her up. Did they say where they were going? No. Helen : Okay, I'm gonna go, um, check the basement and make sure there aren't any leaks from the storm. Is it raining yet? [wind howling] [both breathing heavily] [both grunting and moaning] Can I offer you something? Just some water would be great. Great. [phone buzzing] Do you mind if I just... it's the hospital. Oh, no, go ahead. This is Dr. Ullah. Who? Oh, yeah, okay. Put her through. [mouths words] Hi, Mrs. Gatewood, how's Kim feeling? What? No, no. You have nothing to worry about. The hospital has backup generators. They will... Well... No, none of the machines will stop working, I promise, especially not the ones connected to your daughter's kidney. I know. I know you are. That's perfectly natural, but I promise you have... Well... but you have... You have nothing to worry about. You guys just hang in there for the night, and I'll see you all in the morning for rounds. Okay? Oh... You too. Me too. Yeah, you too. Okay, bye. Needy bitch. Martin : Dr. Ullah? Martin, my man. Hi. Vik : What's happening? What are you doing here? He was in the neighborhood. Vik : Yeah, I came by to check on you, of course, see how you're doing. I'm okay. Well, your mom says you're doing a lot better. Yeah, I guess so. Any more stomachaches? Yeah, if I eat something that I shouldn't. Bitch of a disease, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Well, did your GI recommend Humira injections? Yeah. Uh, he did. Are they helping? Mm. Um, he hates taking them. No? It freaking hurts. Her hands shake. Makes it ten times worse. So we kind of gave up on it. Oh, no. You can't do that. Well, I can show you a trick, makes it much easier. Do you have any in the house? Yeah, I have some in the fridge. No, Mom, I'm fine. Martin, the doctor might be able to show us something that we don't know. I feel fine. Put it back! Hey, Martin. Martin, hey, listen to me. Look, the first thing we're gonna do, we're gonna let this thing warm up. A part of what makes it so painful is the temperature. And then we're gonna put it in your stomach. That's easier than the thigh for some people. And I promise, I have a technique that will make it hurt, like, 60% less. [sighs] Will you let me try it? [exhales] I don't know. Fair enough. Okay. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna hang out here with your mom for 30 minutes while this warms up, and then after 30 minutes, you can decide what you want to do. If you want me to leave, then I will. Deal? Deal. Vik : Great. See you soon. [♪ soft music ♪] ♪♪ I don't get it. What? Get what? Are you a nice guy that acts like a dick or a dick that acts like a nice guy? [laughs] Uh, what's the difference? There's... it's actually really a big difference. Mm, I don't think so. Uh, do you generally feel warmly towards other humans, or is it just sort of a performance or something? I mean... Look. If you're trying to evaluate my character, it's not that hard to work out. If you think, on balance, that the good I do outweighs the bad, I'm a good person. If you think the bad outweighs the good, the opposite is true. But I'm talking about how you feel. Like, feel in your... your... My heart? Yeah. My heart is a muscular organ with four chambers that's located just behind and slightly to the left of my breastbone. It doesn't feel anything. It works. [sniffling] [blows nose softly] [knocking on door] What? What did I say? Nothing. That was just really depressing. You want me to leave? No, no. I want you to stay and give Martin his shots. [sniffling] I know I'm supposed to be the one giving him his shots 'cause I'm his mother, right? Yes, I know that. But you know what, he's right. I do shake, and then I'm terrified. And I-I-I just want to stop hurting him. And this past year with the divorce, all I've done is put my kids through hell. And I just want to make it stop. I want to make it stop, and I cannot get my sh1t together. I mean, I have four kids, and I'm doing this all by myself. How did this happen? How did this happen? You got a divorce. [sighs] You know, sometimes I think... I hate being a mother. [phone buzzing] Oh, just got a Tinder message. Are you serious? I'm sorry. Sorry. What were you saying? Oh, my God. Get out. Just get out. Okay. Now that we've iced it, I'm gonna pinch this spot when I give you the shot. Okay? You ready? [inhales sharply] [Martin grunts] [exhales] Okay. How was that? It was all right. All right. All right. Trevor : Thank you. You're welcome. Babe on TV :  Excuse me. There you go, sweetie. Thanks, Mom. Ooh, you got it? Okay. Babe on TV :  What are you? Maa on TV :  Ewe. Babe :  Pig. What are you? Maa :  I'm a ewe. A ewe! Babe :  You're a sheep! Maa :  I'll not be called a common sheep, thank you kindly. I'm a Border Leicester ewe. The name's Maa. Where you going now? Probably to the hospital. Really? You're not gonna meet your Tinder date? Nah. She lives in Red Hook. I doubt I could find a cab. Well, you're welcome to stay here and wait out the storm. Maa on TV :  Seem like a nice, young pig. What be your name? Babe. Maa :  Not like them wolves. Treat you like dirt, they do. Bite you as soon as they look at you. I'd rather drown. Babe :  Bite you? Maa :  And worse! Some wolves be so bad, they run a sheep down and tear it to pieces. Babe :  Fly would never do that. Maa :  Fly, is it? Well, a right vicious creature she be, I'll tell you... [♪ soft music ♪] ♪♪ [door opens, shuts] Dr. Ullah left? Yeah. Trevor : Just now? Mm-hmm. Trevor : Went out into the storm? ♪♪ [groaning] [exhales deeply] [groans] [winces] [takes a deep breath] [thunder] [phone line trilling] Where are you? Yeah, hi, uh, this is Alison Bailey. I'm a patient of Dr. Rathbone. [thunder] Ah, sh1t. [groaning] [sighing] f*ck. Oh, hey, nurse. Is there any, uh, news from my doctor? Dr. Rathbone can't make it. The roads are bad. He is trapped in Westchester, so I'm filling in for him. I'm Dr. D'Amato. [laughs] You're a doctor. You look so young. Well, I'm 33. Well... wow, 33. A doctor, that's impressive. Is it? Yeah. So I, uh, see this is your second birth. That's a good thing. Means you've been through this before. I-I-I, uh, I can't be going into labor right now. I'm not due for another five weeks. Could it be Braxton-Hicks? Eh, let's take a look, shall we? [sighs] Whoa. What does "whoa" mean? Ah, you are five centimeters dilated already. Alison, you are having a baby tonight. What? No, I... Uh, is there anyone here with you, a partner or... Uh, no, I-I-I don't know where he is. I can't... I can't get him on my phone. He's... he's not picking up. It's okay. It's okay. Relax. We'll find him. [sighing] [thunder] Eden : Rodney had his biggest hits in the '90s, but he's still Hollywood royalty. Everyone loves working with him. He's gonna make a movie of "Descent"? Well, he genuinely loved your book. I think he may have even read the whole thing. So he wants to be in business. You two just have to hit it off. Got it. And if George commits, phew, this movie will get made. George Clooney's really gonna come out in this weather? He said he's coming out for one reason only, Noah. To meet you. [phone buzzing] sh1t, there goes my phone. Where the f*ck is it? [buzzing continues] Can you help me out here? Come on, it'll be here when you get back. [sighs] It's obviously here someplace. Solloway, let's go. There's a long line behind us. [phone buzzing] Okay.

Oh, thank you. Hey, hey, hey, here he is! Here he is! All right. The new bad boy of American letters. Mr. Callahan. [laughs] Rodney, come on. So you having a good time? Anything you need? No, no. I got everything, thanks. You got everything. You got Eden here. Hi, sweetheart. How about just one slap? Go for it, big boy. Whoo! Ooh, I love that girl! Come on, sit down. So let me tell you, I f*cking love your novel. But you know what else I love? The sh1t that you have stirred up, some people calling you the voice of your generation, others saying that the book is nothing but p0rn. I mean, do you know how long it has been since someone dared to mix high art with good old-fashioned f*cking? Hmm? Henry Miller? Nabokov? But nowadays, most authors, they're scared shitless to do something like that. I mean, political correctness has turned us all into a nation of f*cking pussies. [laughing] When I used to hang around with Norman Mailer, I produced two movies based on his novels, you know? He stirred up the same kind of sh1t, but that's how you knew that the books mattered. Here, try this. I hear it's very good. You want some? Eden : No, thanks. Go ahead. Rodney : I'm telling you, Noah, Norman would've loved your book. You're his, uh... You're like his literary son. [chuckles] Wow, thanks. I, uh... I... look, I-I never thought I'd meet a producer in Hollywood who understood my work so well. Rodney : Yeah, you know why that is. 'Cause we're not in Hollywood, yeah. [laughs] Now listen, now listen. Just one thing I want to discuss with you. You don't mind, do you? No, please, anything. Look, like I said before, I love everything about your novel, except that ending. I mean, it's so dark, and I love dark, but come on, sh1t, the guy mows her down in his car? Would you consider, for the movie... well, let me put it to you this way... when we have Jennifer Lawrence playing Lana, she's not gonna end up getting dragged under a f*cking minivan, okay? Mm-mm. So what would you think of doing something a little more upbeat? Maybe romantic? Like the two of them sitting down to dinner with an unimaginable secret between them? Ooh! I love this guy. He reads my mind. No, that was... that was my original i... that's... I f*cking love your idea. Yeah. Why didn't I think of that? That's a great idea. You wanna hear another good idea? Yes. Max : Noah? Really? Hey, Max, what... What the f*ck are you doing here? I could ask you the same question. Hey, come on, hurricane party? You know I can't say no. Max : Isn't this place incredible? My real estate agent sold this house to the host. Some rich Hollywood asshole. Hey, um, Rodney, this is Max. Max, this is the Rodney, the, uh, host. Ah, sh1t. Sorry, man. Sorry. Max Cadman. Rich Wall Street asshole. It takes one to know one, I guess. Max : Ain't that the truth. Those poor suckers in town battening down for the storm, worried for their lives. Look, guys like you and me, Rodney, we know the only way to survive a hurricane... wall-to-wall models. Hey, we're in the middle of a meeting. Who? You... you and Rodney? No sh1t. Yeah, no sh1t. Rodney's gonna produce the movie of my book, so... That's great. Yeah. Don't let me interrupt you guys. Keep... keep talking. I'm gonna do a little work right here. [chuckles] You know, actually, if I could put in my two cents, I've been giving a lot of thought to, uh, the role of Alison. What do you call her in the book, again? The, uh, whatever. Anyway, stick with me here, little outside the box. As Alison, Sasha Grey. How hot would that be? [snorting] Mm, yes. You know who she is, right? Max : No, you don't. You are in for a treat, Rodney. Sasha Grey came out of the adult cinema world. Now she's actually completely legit. She's a beautiful actress, and with her experience, she could kill in the s*x scenes. Come on, you need to go. Let's go. Max, come on, let's go. Why? You gotta go. Jesus f*cking Christ. That was quite rude. Max : Good talking to you, Rodney. Why do I have to leave? I'm trying to close a f*cking important deal, and you're f*cking it up, that's why. I'm f*cking you up? Yes. Maybe you forgot, buddy, that, um, I'm the guy that lent you 50 grand when you were f*cking up your own life... I know, Max. ...which you never paid back. Jake : Excuse me, everyone! You said it was a gift. Can I have your attention, please? I didn't push it because I know you didn't have any f*cking money, right, 'cause you wrote a book, right, and I run a hedge fund. Excuse me. According to the police blotter, they may start shutting down the roads, so anyone who's not waiting out the storm should start leaving. Uh, I gotta get back to business. Business, is that... is that what you're calling it now? Noah, the thing is, you were supposed to be the good guy. Right? I was supposed to be the asshole. Oh, you're still the asshole, Max. I'm sorry about that. How do you know that unpleasant human being? Uh... he was... he was a friend of my ex-wife. Can I? Sure. ♪ I hate the feeling when you're looking at me that way ♪

Did you manage to get a hold of him? No, I think we should forget about him for now. Service is out everywhere with the hurricane. Let's focus on you and that baby, okay? Can you do that for me? [whimpering] Yeah? [breathing heavily] How many babies have you delivered? Quite a few. You don't need to worry. Alison, it is perfectly natural to feel scared right now, okay? But I promise you everything is gonna be okay. [groaning] Yep, breathe. [crying, yelling] [machine beeping] sh1t. [groaning] Oh, thank God for generators, right? Yeah, yeah, breathe. [yelling] Breathe. Breathe, Alison, breathe. [crying] Good job. Yeah, one down. [Alison crying] Oh, God, please keep trying him. I can't do this alone. I can't do this alone. You are not alone. You are not alone. I am not leaving. [breathing heavily] Luisa : Can you believe it? I had to wear my cousins' hand-me-downs. My ma made sure we all got lessons. So when I was 11, I think, it was around Christmas, I was performing  The Nutcracker  with a bunch of little girls, and we had to go point, point, point, arabesque, and then I just lose my balance, and I fell right into Alicia Romero. And of course, all the girls just came down with me. That was when my mom decided that I could quit ballet. Oh, come on. Funny little story, huh? It's a funny story. [thunder] Wow, that storm is crazy. I've seen worse out there. If you won't let me cheer you up, you have to talk about what you're feeling. And I understand. You lived here for a long time. This... this is hard. Well, it should've been a lot easier, if Alison would've shown up to pack up her sh1t. She's the one that wanted to sell this house. [sighs] And she stuck us with the mess. Big surprise. Look, we got the job done. No,  you  got the job done. Everything that was her responsibility  you  did. Well, what about a little thank-you? [♪ soft music ♪] ♪♪ [moans] [both breathing heavily] Oh, sh1t. What happened? I didn't bring any condoms. It's okay. Are you sure? Yeah. Good? Amazing. Don't stop. So what's gonna happen now? What do you mean? Well, after tomorrow, you won't have a place to live. And if you don't mind me saying, a financial planner would be a great idea. You're gonna be Mr. Money Bags. [sighs] She's only giving me that money, so she doesn't have to feel guilty. I'm not gonna take a dime of it. Ugh, okay, well, it's... it's your decision. But where are you gonna live? In a tree? I don't know. I'll figure something out. Well, once I start my new job, it's gonna be hard for me to come out here as much. Montauk is far, and I work on the weekends. Have you ever thought about... moving to the city? Not for a second. Hey, hey. I love you. We're gonna figure something out, okay? Yeah. [thunder subsides] Luisa : What happened? Is this the eye? Yeah. Probably got about a half hour before the second half moves in. [sighs] Luisa : We should go. I want to show you something first. [sighs] Used to cut these in twice a year to show him how big he was getting. [exhales] You think I should take them? [whispers] Of course. The new owner's just gonna knock the place down anyway. [sighs] After that, this'll all be gone. It'll be like we were never here. [sighs] He would've loved you. I mean, everybody loves you. And who knows, maybe one day, we can cut in some notches for our own kids. [exhales] Did I say something wrong? No, what you said was lovely. I, uh... [sighs] Hey. What just happened there? Nothing. I, uh... should've told you sooner. [sighs] I c... I can't. You can't what? I can't get pregnant. I'm infertile. [♪ soft music ♪] ♪♪ When... when I was 22, I got these... things growing inside me, some fibroids. One was as big as a grapefruit. I didn't have health insurance at the time, so, I mean, I couldn't go to the doctor. I mean, I couldn't afford it. One day, I started bleeding, so my cousin found this guy. She told me he was a surgeon back wherever he came from, and... he removed the fibroids but left some scars all over the place. I can't grow a baby in there. [sighs] I'm sorry. I should've told you sooner, but I just... I'm sorry. [sniffles] f*ck me. [laughs] Cole? Oh, f*ck me. [groans] It's true. What are you talking about? All of it, it's all true, all that crazy sh1t my mother was spouting at Thanksgiving. We're cursed. My family is cursed. [Cole sighs] What curse? Remember? Uh... I went over to her place for dinner, Thanksgiving, before I came to see you, and she was just going off with all this insane bullshit about how my grandfather was a baby killer and we were cursed, just voodoo nonsense. And I... and I... I got out of there, but now it turns out she was right. We are cursed 'cause there will never be another Lockhart child. You can't have children, so that's it. That's it. Let me see if I got this. You're telling me that my infertility has something to do with your fucked-up family curse? That the scars in my uterus are the result of some crime your grandfather did, I don't know, a f*cking hundred years ago? Well, when you put it like that... Is there another way to put it, Cole? I'm sorry, okay? I shouldn't have opened my mouth. Look, I understand. I mean, you lost a child. That's... that's horrible. That has to be the worst that can happen to anyone. But all of this... f*ck, you're so f*cking dramatic. The world does not revolve around your pain. I know that. Do you? Because you don't seem like you know. You drive a cab, you don't plan for the future, and you don't give a sh1t about your family. Scotty takes care of the family now. Scotty's a f*cking addict. He needs to go to rehab. But at least he's trying, which is more than I can say for you. Wait, hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait. You know what, a lot of bad sh1t has happened to me too. In fact, if you've forgotten, I'm the one who can't have babies. But I put one foot in front of the other every single f*cking day because I want to make my life better. Okay, fine! I'm sorry. I was joking! I'm sorry I brought up that stupid f*cking curse. Well, I'm not, because this has made something really clear to me. Anything that goes wrong in your life, you blame someone else... your mother, your ex-wife, even your f*cking dead grandfather... which means that, if something goes wrong with us, you're gonna blame me. Where are you gonna go? If you want your sh1t, it'll be in the Butlers' garage. No, no, I don't want you leaving now. It's not safe. It's walking distance. I'll be fine. [sighs] You know what, I love you, Cole. [groans] But I can't get rid of your curse. You have to do it for yourself. Okay, fine, fine. Go. You should go now.
