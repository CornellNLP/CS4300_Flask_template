 Alison :  Previously on  The Affair... 
 Is this your daughter? 
 Yeah. 
 Everybody says she looks like Alison,  but to me, she looks like her daddy. 
 You know what? She does to me too. 
 Alison :  I saw Scotty this morning. He had some plan about buying The Lobster Roll  and wanted me to go in with him. 
 I mean, it's not like The Lobster Roll's even for sale. 
 Alison :  Well, no, it's... it's in foreclosure. 
 Cole :  Really? 
 Noah :  So what's going on, Alison? 
 I bought this place. 
 I heard. 
 With Cole. 
 As business partners. 
 How does this work? You gonna move back out here? 
 You taking Joanie with you? 
 I just hoped we could figure it out together. 
 Scotty :  This was my idea. 
 I-I told you about this. 
 I told you  both  about this. 
 You're a f*cking junkie! 
 God damn it, Cole! 
 I could tell you something that would blow up your entire f*cking life. 
 Cut me in!

 Scotty. 
 I will bring you in. I promise. 
 You just got to go someplace that's gonna give you some help. 
 Ladies and gents, it's time to talk about that night. 
 Look, I didn't kill Scott Lockhart. 
 I guess we got to find out who did.

I was furious with Alison when she told me she was pregnant. I thought she had done it deliberately to trap me, make sure I could never go back to you. Were you even thinking about going back to me? I always think about it, Helen. Being back here is so f*cking strange. I was driving out here this morning past the farm stands and the windmills, and I felt the children in the... behind me in the car. I felt you sitting next to me. Even felt that pit in my stomach I used to get when we visited your parents. Had to remind myself that wasn't my life anymore and to force myself to remember Alison and Joanie and... It's like the last three years never happened. They just evaporated. Sometimes I wake up and I forget the past 25 years ever happened. Are you trying to cheer me up, or are you trying to finish me off? I-I... [laughs] I'm not sure yet. How's Vik? He's good. He just got a major job offer in L.A., at the Children's Hospital there.

God, you'd have thought we'd be better at this by now. What do you mean? Well, we're not exactly young. I'd have thought by this age, we might have figured more things out. You know, be more in control. Yeah. It does seem to be a sort of never-ending sh1t show, doesn't it? Yeah. Mm. What are you doing? Can't keep talking about this. I'll kill myself.

And this came from Jeffries today? He presented it to the prosecution this morning. Why? W-why did he go back there? I don't know. Said he had lingering suspicions. Couldn't sleep. About Alison? I did some research a few weeks back, and something came up which I was hoping, I was praying I wouldn't have to share with you, but it doesn't look like we have that option anymore. What is this? [paper rustles] It's a DNA report. I had a sample of Joanie's DNA analyzed. You're not her father. I'm sorry to have to tell you that. [♪ dark music ♪] ♪ I know that, Jon. What? Y-you... you know? Why is this relevant? Well, uh... I also have a video of an altercation between Scotty and Alison taken outside The Lobster Roll the night that Scott was killed. I have phone records wherein it shows he called her multiple times in the months leading up to his death. I suspected that, perhaps, Scott was Joanie's father. Obviously, since the report came back, I realized that isn't true. No. It's Cole. ♪ Right. [clears throat] Just what the test indicated. [sighs] So I started to formulate a hypothesis. Maybe Scott knew Cole was Joanie's father. Maybe he was blackmailing her. Maybe she killed him to keep him quiet. Come on, Jon, that... that's... that's ridiculous. Gottlief : Not to me. I can now put her at the site on the night of the accident. Hey, for all we know, they got into another fight. She pushed him in front of an oncoming car. I don't know. The point is that I believe we have enough evidence now to build reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds, enough to hang 'em or maybe even to get you off entirely. By turning the blame on Alison? Noah, look, I have been doing this a long time, and I usually can feel which way a jury is leaning in my bones. I do not have a good feeling about this. We're running out of time. This is my Hail Mary pass. I have to put Detective Jeffries on the stand. Now, what I'm asking you is, do I have your permission to do that? [♪ tense music ♪] [sighs] ♪ [seagulls calling] Alison : No, that's too much. I can get them from Danny for two bucks less. Paul : Not for hard backs. I don't need hard backs. Thought you said this was a wedding. No, we're making salad. I need soft shells and culls. Listen, you said wedding. I thought you were doing something special. Excuse me. Okay, Paulie, how about you lose the attitude and you just give them to me for eight? You insane? Eleven. No way. Eleven? I can just go to the wholesaler. I know for a fact that Sysco gives them to Danny for seven, so eight is a good deal. Not for these puppies. These are from my secret place. They're sweeter. Your "secret place"? [chuckles] Fine. You don't believe me? Go to Danny,  if  the DEC hasn't shut him down for selling undersized bugs. You'll be lucky to get a half a pound off him, but hey, knock yourself out, sweetheart. Okay, nine is my final offer. Make it ten, you got a deal.

Noah : Really? They're not taking a honeymoon? Actually, they've, uh... they've asked me to stay on a little longer. What? Well, just until they get back from their honeymoon. How long is that? Uh, a few weeks. A few weeks? Um, look, I've been meaning to ask you, um... Cole and I have an idea that maybe we can keep the restaurant open all year. Uh, not full-time, of course, just Thursday to Sunday. Okay. What do you think of that? Well, as long as you're just a silent investor, it makes no difference to me. [sighs] That was the agreement, Alison. Alison : Yeah, I know. Y-you work out here during the summer. In the fall... I know. This was never supposed to turn into a full-time gig. I know. So what are you trying to tell me? [sighs] Um... I like it. What, you like being away from us for half the week? Wait, no, I... I like the work. I booked a trip to Europe in the fall. Remember? Yeah, I know, and it's fine. You can go, and I'll just bring Joanie out here with me and Gigi too, and... [sighs] You know, you'd be free to do all the writing you want, you...

Alison : No. Look, we can... [door opens] I'm looking for Alison. She's right there. Hey. Did I interrupt something? No, no, it's fine. [laughs softly] Is it still okay for me to change here?

Y-yeah, I think you'll feel fine tomorrow. [chuckles] Is her family here yet? Yeah, some of them. Yeah. There's a lot of them. And they expect to spend a lot of time with us. Well, then it's good you're here and not back in the city. Cole : You know, she can be a little irrational. Not a little irrational. I mean... you know, most of the time, we're good, I understand where she's coming from, but sometimes she is legitimately crazy. What, Luisa? Yeah. I find that hard to imagine. Why... Cole : No, she says she's affected by the cycles of the moon, which I thought was bullshit, but she's right. I mean, every full moon, she's like... she's completely emotional; she makes no sense. Okay, well, that's only a few days a month. [scoffs] She can't have kids. Did you know that? No. I didn't. Yeah. [sighs] Well, you have... you have talked about it, right? Not really. No. We talked... around it. You know, maybe... [sighs] ...adopt in a couple years, which... I said I was cool with, but...

[chuckles] This place? Yeah, it was like this beacon of hope throughout that whole process. Hey, what's going on over here? There he is, the man of the hour. [chuckles] Oh, congratulations again, man. Cole : Thank you. Your... your vows were just awesome. I may have even teared up a little bit. [both chuckle] Everything okay? Yeah, he was just saying how important this place was during rehab. ♪ Oh, yeah? Yeah, man, really, I was just... I was trying to say thank you. I... knowing that you guys believed in me and wanting to make me a partner when I got clean, it... it... it saved me. Oh. I mean, it saved my life. No, no, no, seriously, you guys saved my life. We're just happy that you're better. You gave us a hell of a scare there, Scott. No, I know I did, and... and I'm gonna go back for another month and, you know, dot my Is, cross my Ts, make sure that I'm free and clear, but I want you guys to know that I am fully available for... for whatever you need. I-I can call in to meetings. You can send me figures. Whatever you... I mean, we got that covered. Right? I mean, we'll be fine. I think the best thing that you can do is go back there, take as much time as you need, get healthy, and then, you know, when you come out for good, then we can discuss our arrangement here. ♪ Arrangement? What do you mean by that? ♪ You know, Scott, I don't think this is the most appropriate place for this... No, no, no, no, no, you're right. You're totally right. But, um... [chuckles] ...the... the deal is still in place, right? I mean, we, uh... we just got to hammer out the details, but I'm still a partner in this, correct? What the f*ck did you think was gonna happen, Scott? You're gonna go to rehab for three months and then you just walk back into our lives and everything's forgiven? Scotty : Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second here. Alison : Cole... I am just going off of what you said. You said that if I went to rehab, if I did... if I did the work... And got yourself clean, really clean, for good. Cole, I am clean. Good, then do it for six months. Do it for a year. Then we can talk. No, no, no, no. That was not our deal. Shut the f*ck up about this deal like we were in a lawyer's office signing papers. For f*ck's sake, Scott, you were drunk. You were high as a kite. I was trying to save your life, get you to rehab.
