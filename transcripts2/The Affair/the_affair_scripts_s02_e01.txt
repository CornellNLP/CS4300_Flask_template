 Noah : Previously on The Affair... 
 Jeffries : Mr. Solloway, thanks for coming in. 
 Noah : Not like I had much of a choice. 
 So I read your book. 
 Everyone has one book in them. 
 Almost nobody has two. 
 Welcome to the end of the world. 
 Jeffries : Do you remember the first time you saw her? 
 Noah : Like it was yesterday. 
 Jeffries : Ms. Lockhart, do you remember seeing him for the first time? 
 Turn her over. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Hit her hard! 
 Alison : I remember he was holding his daughter. 
 Helen : Do something! 
 Noah : You saved her life. 
 I'm Noah, by the way. 
 Helen and I are trying to raise decent human beings. 
 Not just get more, spend more. 
 As you accept our money for private school tuition... 
 Mom, stop trying to pick a fight with my husband. 
 Bruce : This is Harry, my agent. 
 So Bruce tells me that you're working on something new this summer? 
 Noah : Uh, well, I haven't really gotten too far with it. 
 Excuse me, sir, you ordered a whiskey. 
 Helen : Is she flirting with you? 
 You wanna get out of here? 
 There's this hypothesis in theoretical physics. 
 Your true life continues as is, unchanged, but at the moment of decision, a new life splits off into a parallel universe. 
 How is any of this relevant to what happened? 
 Trying to figure out if anyone might have had a motive to kill this fella. 
 I thought it was an accident. 
 kids : Uncle Max! 
 Noah : I didn't know you invited Max. 
 Max : Helen the felon. 
 Hello. 
 Come here. 
 Mom! 
 Harry : It's extraordinary. 
 I want it in stores by next fall. 
 Noah : I don't want this life. 
 I have to leave. 
 I'm in love with someone else. 
 I'm looking for Mr. Solloway. 
 Is he home? You're under arrest. 
 Alison : I'll get you out of this, I promise. 
 Mr. Solloway, you have the right to remain silent. 
 Alison : Do you believe me?

 [indistinct PA announcement] 
 [train whistle blows] 
 I thought you said that you were considering it. 
 I did. 
 I thought long and hard about it. 
 It just... 
 I don't know, it just didn't feel right to me anymore. 
 And so you wanna go with this ending instead? 
 I think it's really powerful. 
 [sighs] Well, what can I tell you? 
 I don't agree. 
 Oh, come on, Harry. 
 It's much subtler. 
 It's two people sitting down to dinner. 
 Yeah, with an unimaginable secret between them. 
 Doesn't have the punch of your first idea. 
 Murder, it's... it's... it's salacious. 
 It's... it's cheap. It... 
 Well, it doesn't have to be. 
 Have you read Of Mice and Men? 
 Is that a rhetorical question? 
 Well, you may want to review it. 
 The murder at the end of that book felt surprising while it was happening and completely inevitable in retrospect. 
 Like all great endings in literature. 
 So what are you saying, you won't publish it if I don't change the ending? 
 I'm not saying that. 
 'Cause, you know, as generous as that advance you got me was, I still only got a fifth of it. 
 That's because that's how advances work. 
 You'll get the next part when you submit the final draft. 
 This is the final draft. 
 Maybe you should take another pass at the end. 
 No, just one more pass. 
 Oh, God. 
 Okay, maybe I should be more articulate about what I did appreciate in this draft. 
 I thought bringing the feud to the foreground of the earlier chapters worked beautifully. 
 There's something almost epic in the way that you now depict that family, those four brothers... 
 "Almost"? 
 It's got a real East of Eden feel to me. 
 What is it with you and Steinbeck today? 
 And I love the way that you introduced Lana. 
 And I gotta ask, how much of this is based on what happened between you and, um, what's her actual name? 
 It's fiction, Harry. 
 All right. All right. 
 [sighs] I know this is frustrating for you, but you're in the final stretch, buddy. 
 Don't go soft on me, okay? 
 You have something very powerful to say. 
 I just want you to say it.

 Noah! 
 Hey, Jordy. 
 How's it going? 
 Man, it's been forever. 
 Where you been? 
 Uh, I... I've been upstate, in a little... just a writer's retreat. 
 Working on something new or... 
 That's right, yeah. 
 I can't wait to read it. 
 You know, I feel terrible we haven't seen more of you guys this summer. 
 We've been meaning to have you over. 
 It's just with the end of the school year, you know how it is. 
 Everything's so out of control. 
 And Becca's mother is staying with us right now, which makes me wanna... 
 [chuckles] 
 What are you doing tonight? 
 Um, I... Oh, I... 
 No, f*ck, I can't tonight. 
 Daddy. 
 Duck. 
 I said "duck." 
 Uh, listen, as soon as I get home, I'm gonna check the Google Calendar and have Becca call Helen and make a date. 
 How's that sound? 
 Great. 
 It's great to see you, man. You look good. 
 You too. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Hey, I'm Noah Solloway. Sorry I'm late. 
 No problem, dude. We're ready to go. 
 How much stuff you got? 
 You know what, this is a kind of sensitive situation. 
 You just wait here. I'll bring the stuff out. 
 All of it? 
 Yeah, yeah. I think I can manage. 
 All right, man. Whatever works. 
 [door buzzer] 
 Where's Helen? 
 She's not here. 
 Where did she go? 
 That's none of your business. 
 Okay, I'm here to... 
 I know why you're here. 
 That's why I'm here. 
 Oh. 
 Can I... 
 Oh, by all means, come in. 
 Kids? 
 I've sent them all away. 
 You sent them away? 
 Yes, Noah. 
 I didn't think it would do them any favors to be subjected to the traumatic consequences of their father's psychosis. 
 Helen and I have taken the liberty of putting most of your things in the basement. 
 [exhales] 
 Thanks. 
 Where's the rest of my stuff, Margaret? 
 It hasn't been appraised. 
 What? 
 Once the divorce is finalized, we'll have a professional make an inventory of the house and determine the value of the rest of the property, and then we'll ship you whatever you're owed, or Helen can just write a check. 
 Since, let's just be honest, what you really need is money, isn't it? 
 Is this all your stuff? 
 No, it's not. 
 Margaret : What do you think you're doing? 
 These books are mine. I'm taking them. 
 Not until their value has been determined. 
 They're paperbacks! 
 They might have sentimental value to Helen. 
 Put that back! That's Le Creuset! 
 Noah, I'm not gonna ask you again. 
 Margaret, be reasonable. 
 These mugs are chipped. This pot is stained. 
 I don't care if they have holes in the goddamn bottom! 
 Noah, get back here! 
 Who do you think you are? 
 This is my daughter's house! This is her property! 
 And the fact that you had the audacity to come and show your face here after what you've done to my family... 
 Absolutely not! It has to be appraised! 
 I swear, if you don't stop what you're doing, I'm gonna call the police. 
 Margaret, my father painted this f*cking painting. 
 Now if you don't get out of my way, I swear to God I'll push you down the f*cking flight of stairs behind you, and I'll tell the coroner it was a f*cking accident! 
 Martin : Dad? 
 Hey, buddy. 
 I thought you weren't here. 
 Oops. 
 Can I come in? 
 How you doing? 
 Stomachache. 
 What kind of stomachache? 
 The kind that hurts. 
 Think you're getting sick? 
 I'll be fine, Dad. Just leave me alone. 
 [siren wails in the distance] 
 Well, I hope you get better soon. 
 I got tickets for the Yankees tomorrow. 
 Spend the whole day together. 
 Talk about what's been going on between your mom and me, just the two of us. 
 I can't go. 
 What do you mean you can't go? 
 I have a psychologist appointment. 
 You have what? 
 Grandma made it for me. 
 He's the best adolescent psychologist in the city. 
 I had to use every bit of influence I had to make this appointment. 
 Noah, your son hasn't been out of his room in a month. 
 I watched him play basketball last week! 
 We are all incredibly worried about him. 
 His stomachaches seem to be getting worse, especially when you come around. 
 Margaret, I gotta ask you, how the f*ck do you face yourself in the mirror each morning? 
 How the f*ck do you? 
 Listen, I can't be there to meet you. 
 I gotta take care of something in the city, but, uh, just leave it all on the deck outside, okay? 
 Absolutely, man. You're the boss. 
 Here you go. 
 Trevor : Dad? 
 Hi, Dad! 
 Trevor, hey! 
 Where have you been? I thought you were at camp. 
 I hate camp. It's too sporty. 
 But it's theater camp, isn't it? 
 Yeah, but it's outdoors in the park, and they want to do all these movement games. 
 And, like, three kids have already gotten ticks. 
 Did you run away? 
 It's fine. I left a note. 
 Let's go to the movies. 
 Come on, Trevor, Trevor, we have to go back to camp. 
 But why? Why can't we hang out? 
 I can't. I'm on my way to an appointment. 
 What kind of appointment? 
 I'm meeting... meeting with your mom. 
 I knew you'd work it out. I knew it. 
 Whitney said you were getting divorced, but I told her no, that was ridiculous. 
 Okay, let's... let's, um... just sit down on the stoop for a minute, come here. 
 Why? 
 Just... just sit down. 
 So what has... what has Mom said about what's happening between her and me? 
 She said you're having a midlife crisis. 
 She did? 
 Yeah, and she said you need some time to get your head out of your ass, and then you'll be back and everything will be fine. 
 Okay, listen, little man. 
 Listen to me. 
 I have to tell you something, and it's gonna suck, okay? 
 Your mom and I, we are getting a divorce. 
 No. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, buddy. 
 I know that's not what you wanna hear. 
 Why? 
 It's... it's very complicated. 
 What did Mom do? 
 She didn't do anything. 
 Then why are you divorcing her? 
 Because we don't get along so well anymore, and because I... 
 I fell in love with somebody else. 
 How? 
 I don't know exactly. I just did. 
 But you're married to Mom. 
 Look, sometimes... sometimes you can fall in love with somebody you're not married to. 
 And sometimes the way you love the person you are married to, it can... it can change. 
 Can the way you love your children change too? 
 No, no, not at all. 
 That always stays exactly the same. 
 Look, I know this doesn't make a lot of sense to you now, but I promise you one day you'll understand. 
 I promise, okay? And it's not gonna be so bad. 
 I'm gonna get a new place, and you're gonna have your own room. 
 I don't want a new room! 
 Trevor... Oh, f*ck! 
 Ow. Trevor, come... 
 Trevor, come back! 
 Ow! 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Ow. 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 [knocks] 
 Hi, sorry I'm late. 
 What happened? 
 Oh, it's nothing. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Who's worried? 
 Mr. Solloway. Jeremy. 
 Welcome. Have a seat. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 So since we're already short on time, let's dive right in. 
 I'll start with the obvious question. 
 Have either of you been through the mediation process before? 
 And this is your first divorce, both of you? 
 Yes. 
 Ah, excellent. 
 Rookies. I love rookies. 
 Uh, I understand what a difficult time this must be for both of you, so I will start by trying to make you feel a little better. 
 You have already done yourselves a tremendous service. 
 You have chosen to divorce in what I like to call a humane way. 
 You're not shooting your marriage in the head. 
 You're not running it over with a car. 
 You're not dousing it with gasoline and lighting it on fire. 
 You're just putting it humanely to sleep. 
 So just take a moment and congratulate yourselves on, uh, on this choice. 
 Congratulations, Noah. 
 Great. 
 Great. 
 So let me tell you how I can help. 
 You're both gonna tell me the issues on the table that are important to each of you in this process. 
 And once we've got our list, we'll talk about the alternatives until we find a solution that we all can agree on. 
 Then I'll write up a sort of contract in legalese, which is when I'll get to put my three years of law school to a modicum of use. 
 [chuckles] 
 I'll present you with the papers. 
 You'll both sign, and, voila, you're divorced. 
 [clicks tongue] Easy-peasy. 
 So I see you own a house together. 
 Is that right? 
 Not exactly. 
 It's mine. 
 Did the purchase precede the marriage? 
 Helen : No. 
 Then the house is considered joint property, Mrs. Solloway, even though it may be in your name. 
 It was purchased through my trust, so... it's mine. 
 Ah, I see. That's a horse of a different color. 
 And were you aware of this situation, Mr. Solloway? 
 Yeah, yeah, I was. It's fine. 
 Great. 
 So house is going to Helen. What's next? 
 My store. 
 Keep it. 
 Are you sure, Mr. Solloway? 
 'Cause under New York law, any proceeds from any businesses can be divisible for a period of... 
 Yeah, I'm sure. It's her store. 
 Look, all I want is joint custody of the kids. 
 I want us to agree on a schedule of clear visitations, and I want it in writing so that it can't be changed. 
 You sound upset. 
 A little, Helen, yeah. 
 I told you I had tickets behind home plate for the game tomorrow. 
 And then I find out that your mother has... 
 He doesn't sleep, Noah. 
 He barely eats. 
 Well, maybe he's sick. Did you take him to the doctor? 
 He's not sick. He's devastated. 
 He didn't say anything about that to me. 
 Well, I don't know what to tell you. 
 Maybe he's hiding it from you. 
 It's not as if you've been around much lately. 
 Jeremy : Okay, so... 
 So far the only issue on the table is custody, and that is a big one, believe me. 
 But before we tackle it, is there anything else, uh, you'd like to add to this list? 
 Anything perhaps from you, Mrs. Solloway? 
 No, I want nothing from him. 
 But would you take half of nothing? 
 It's a... sorry, it's a little mediation humor. 
 [chuckles] 
 Not for everyone, right? 
 But, uh, moving on. What about you, Mr. Solloway? 
 Any assets you wish to disclose? 
 Now would be the time. 
 I have this book that I'm writing. 
 Right, now I saw from my notes that you've been published, so I imagine you got some sort of advance on this new book? 
 That's right. 
 Yeah, that is something that we definitely should discuss, as well as any potential profits. 
 What? 
 The word "profits" just... it struck me as funny for some reason in this context. 
 In the context of my book? 
 Yeah. 
 You're an asshole. 
 [scoffs] He can keep the profits and the advance. 
 So am I to understand that we're taking the book off the table, Mrs. Solloway? 
 Yes. 
 Wow. 
 You two. 
 I may even make it home today for a little afternoon delight. 
 I don't understand why you're even asking for joint custody when you live in a shack in the woods. 
 It's a cabin. It's not a shack. 
 Where are the children going to sleep? 
 As soon as my book is finished, I'll get the rest of my advance, and then I'll rent an apartment in the city that's big enough for all of us. 
 Really? A four-bedroom apartment? 
 Well, the boys can share a room if... 
 With your advance? 
 Where in the city are you looking, Coney Island? 
 It's $400,000, Helen. 
 Okay? 
 You think that's enough to afford something suitable? 
 Wow. 
 Good for you. 
 Are you sure you don't want to reconsider your claim on Mr. Solloway's book? 
 No, thank you. 
 Okay. 
 So, Mr. Solloway, your plan is to move back to the city in the near future? 
 That's right. 
 And just so I understand this, where are you living at this moment? 
 In a guesthouse on an estate in Cold Spring, New York. 
 Living alone. Guesthouse. 
 Cold Spring. 
 But as soon as you finish your novel, you're reasonably certain you can provide a comfortable living arrangement for your children in close proximity to their home? 
 I'm sorry, how many children do you have? 
 Four. 
 Four! 
 Damn. [chuckles] 
 You don't get a lot of couples through here with four children. 
 Where did you find that guy? 
 He's very highly recommended. 
 He did the Jonathan Safran Foer, Nicole Krauss divorce, and now they live in adjacent brownstones in Brooklyn. 
 But if you don't like him, we can find somebody else. 
 Do you like him? 
 I honestly don't care. 
 I just... 
 I want this to be as fast and painless as possible. 
 Okay, well, yeah, I want that too. 
 Well, then let's just go back. 
 I mean, the sooner we figure this out, the sooner we move on with our lives, right? 
 Whitney won't answer my calls. 
 Well, she's pissed at you. 
 Yeah, well, I can't fix that unless she talks to me about it. 
 Will you ask her to call me? 
 Sure. 
 Are you still seeing her? 
 I don't want her anywhere near my kids. 
 Let's talk about this next session. 
 That's all I'm asking for, Noah. 
 It's the only thing I want. 
 Well, you might not get to have everything you want, Helen. 
 You're so selfish. 
 How did I not see that all these years?

 So I added two creams and two sugars. 
 Great. 
 Trust me. 
 It's precinct coffee. It needs help. 
 Can I sit? 
 Of course. 
 So I'm worried about your bail hearing. 
 Why? 
 Local judge, local boy. City perp. 
 Right. 
 I've known this judge my whole life. 
 He was born here. 
 His brothers are all cops. 
 He was the shining star of the family. 
 Used to be a real nice guy, but then his wife was killed a few years back, and it turned him hard. 
 Killed, how? 
 Hit-and-run. 
 My advice, take a plea. 
 You'll probably walk. Clean record. 
 Heavy fine, but you can pay it. 
 A year's probation. Maybe two. 
 They can't prove you were drunk. 
 Or speeding. 
 They can't even prove you actually killed him. 
 No witnesses. 
 You confess, make a plea on what is basically leaving the scene of the accident... it'll be like it never happened. 
 But you go to trial with this judge in this political climate... 
 I know for a fact Albany's been getting calls. 
 They're trying to increase the minimum sentence from 2 years to 15 for a fatal hit-and-run. 
 15 years, Noah. 
 25 for vehicular homicide if they can convince the jury you had motive. 
 You don't want to risk that, do you, man? 
 You've got a young baby at home. 
 You're not crazy. 
 I want... a f*cking lawyer.

 Yes, hi. 
 I need a protein scramble, gluten-free toast, and two almond milk cappuccinos. 
 You gotta give up that dairy. It's gonna kill you. 
 You want any champagne? 
 No, just a fruit plate, please. 
 Oh, and a fruit plate, please. 
 But hey, listen, make sure it's assorted fruit, okay?

 I just bought this hotel. 
 That's right, Penthouse D. 
 Like "dog." Thank you. 
 You know... hotels have all these tricks to gouge you. 
 Oh, good morning, city of dreams. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Look at this hotel room. 
 You have to clean it up. 
 Why? That's what housekeeping's for. 
 But we destroyed it. It's embarrassing. 
 You're so adorable, I can't stand it. 
 Don't worry, we're celebrating. 
 It's a big deal. They understand. 
 The Greenpoint Hotel Group, people have been chasing this acquisition for years. 
 We just became a global enterprise. 
 Our analyst pushed the price target up 16 points. 
 I'm boring, aren't I? 
 No. 
 Wow, yes, I am. 
 No. 
 You hate money. 
 [laughs] No, I don't. 
 You're such a bohemian. That's what I love about you. 
 Remember... you remember when you used to make those, uh, dream catchers in college? 
 [chuckles] 
 I still have mine. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Did I say something? 
 Mm-mm. 
 Did I do something? 
 Mm-mm. 
 You hate almond milk. 
 No. 
 Yeah, you do. 
 No. 
 What? 
 I just... 
 I just have to go to this benefit tonight because my mother just joined the board of a new dance company. 
 And Noah was supposed to go with me, and now I have to go alone, and I'm dreading it. 
 So don't go. 
 I have to. 
 It's so important to my mother.

 How long have you been a mediator? 
 About ten years. 
 And you enjoy it? 
 Not really. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, it's not that much fun watching couples bicker about who gets the dog at Christmas, but it pays the bills, and being a lawyer sucks, so... 
 I'm sorry he's late. 
 It happens. 
 Probably why you're getting divorced, right? 
 Because he's late? 
 Because he's irresponsible, disrespectful, and generally unconcerned with anyone's needs but his own. 
 No. 
 We're getting a divorce because he had an affair. 
 Yeah, symptom, not disease.

 Um, you tell me what you wanna talk about. 
 Then you talk about that stuff. 
 I'm here to referee if things get ugly. 
 Eventually you come to some decisions. 
 I'll write up a contract, and we can all move on with our lives. 
 Capisce? 
 Capisce. 
 Great. 
 [exhales] 
 Who, uh... 
 Who wants to start? 
 Helen? 
 Um... 
 Okay, uh, no matter what happens here, I...it's very important to me that the kids maintain a good relationship with their father. 
 [scoffs] 
 I want their lives disrupted as little as possible. 
 So I thought that maybe we could find you a place nearby and they could stay with you half the time. 
 I don't see how that's gonna be possible. 
 A four-bedroom apartment in New York? 
 I can't afford that. 
 I...Yeah, I know. 
 I thought maybe I could help you out. 
 With what, the negative income you make at your store? 
 Well, no. 
 I thought my parents... 
 Oh, f*ck no. 
 No, I am done taking f*cking money from your f*cking parents, Helen. 
 How many times do I need to say that before it gets into your skull? 
 Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna call a time-out. 
 Language. 
 Why are you being so awful? 
 I'm sorry, I just... 
 I have a really busy schedule today. 
 I have a meeting with my editor right after this. 
 I can't be late. 
 Understood, Mr. Solloway. 
 If you cooperate, this goes quicker. 
 Do you even want custody of them? 
 Of course I do. 
 Then how do you suggest we go about it? 
 I need time to finish my book, and then I'll have some more money. 
 Okay, until then... 
 What? 
 What? 
 You're gonna postpone the divorce? 
 No. 
 [sighs] 
 I-I really don't understand what... what... 
 I don't understand what he's trying to say. 
 Mr. Solloway, you want joint custody of your children, correct? 
 Yes. 
 Do you have a physical space for them to live in at the moment? 
 No, not at the moment. 
 Well, that is what we are trying to figure out. 
 Well, can't we just agree on joint custody now, and then I'll figure out the living space when I have the means? 
 Uh, we can. It's a little unorthodox, but if your wife is comfortable with it. 
 Where are you living? 
 I'm living in a guesthouse in Cold Spring. 
 Harry got it for me. 
 What are you doing there? 
 Just writing. 
 All the time. 
 Are you living with her? 
 No, Helen, I'm not.

 Gorgeous.

 Reach through those fingertips. 
 Rise up on your toes, and bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée. 
 Plié.

 Let's rise up again, up on your toes. 
 Bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée... 
 woman : Anyway, the worst part is that he did the whole thing right under her nose, while they were staying at her mother's house. 
 woman : The whole family? 
 Kids and all. 
 How did she find out? 
 He told her. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 He just came home one day and told her and said, "I'm leaving you." 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, I feel sick. 
 Right? 
 I mean, that can happen. 
 Poor Helen. 
 You know, they never seemed happy to me. 
 Yes, they did. 
 No, I'm telling you. 
 He always had this dead look in his eyes. 
 [clears throat] 
 Helen. 
 You look great. 
 Thanks, Sandy. 
 Now take places.

 ballet instructor : Okay, ladies. 
 Let's take fifth position. 
 I want three in the front and three in the back. 
 You were amazing in there today. 
 I've been practicing. 
 I could tell. Are you hungry? 
 I'm starving. 
 You wanna go to the diner? 
 Me too. 
 Sandra : Helen. 
 Oh, I'm just so glad I caught you. 
 I thought you left already. 
 Well, actually, we're on our way. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I didn't mean to be gossiping back there. 
 It's just... I just found out, and it's such a shock. 
 It is. Yeah, I know. 
 How are you? 
 I'm fine, just fine. 
 Yeah, you're so strong. 
 I mean, if it were me, I would... 
 I would be on lithium, is what I would be. 
 Well, luckily it's not you. 
 Well, listen, can I just ask you the tiniest question? 
 Two seconds, I promise. 
 Um, Stacey, Carly has something to tell you, okay? 
 She's right over there. Just one second, okay? 
 Carly, what did you have... 
 Um... did you know? 
 Excuse me? 
 Did you know that he was... 
 I mean, like, were there clues? 
 You know, like things maybe you were ignoring but which, in retrospect, seem really obvious? 
 Wow, are you... Why are you asking me this? 
 I mean, are you worried about Jeff or... 
 No. Jeff? Please. 
 I'm the best thing that ever happened to him. 
 He knows that. No, I just... 
 I just have heard that, you know, like, there's sometimes, like, a... a sixth sense that women have. 
 You know, like a kind of aura? 
 You know, now that you mention it, there was a sort of rainbow shooting out of his dick last summer. 
 I probably should have paid more attention to that. 
 Stacey, honey, let's go. 
 Nice to see you. 
 Come on, honey.

 Go ahead, honey. 
 [Trevor sobbing] 
 Trevor, what happened? 
 His father told him you're getting a divorce. 
 [Trevor sobbing] 
 Sweetheart. 
 Mom, why did you do it? 
 I'm really sorry, honey. 
 Come here. Okay. 
 Hey, Mom. 
 Mom, I can write my college essay on anything I want, right? 
 Yes, I think so. Is that what it says? 
 Yes, it does. Can you please tell Grandma? 
 Tell Grandma? 
 She's supposed to write about an experience of some significance. 
 Instead, she wants to write about the time her father put a gun to her head. 
 Helen : Oh, Whitney. 
 He didn't put a gun to my head! 
 Cole did! She knows this! 
 Okay, it is significant, because not a lot of other kids have been through a near-death experience. 
 I just don't think that... 
 I simply told her that if she couldn't think of anything more intelligent to write about, if she found it necessary to exploit this family's private shame for her own advantage... 
 Helen : Oh, Mom. 
 That was fine. 
 I just wasn't gonna pay for anything that came of it, educational or otherwise. 
 I'm sorry, Helen. That's just the way I feel. 
 Dinner will be ready in 15 minutes. 
 Maybe this time Martin can join us. 
 It's my college essay! 
 They want me to express myself! 
 Margaret : That isn't self-expression! 
 It's self-indulgence! 
 [Trevor sobbing] 
 Looks good. 
 How was mediation? 
 Fine, I think. 
 Are you ready to give up this little humanitarian project, so we can litigate? 
 I don't think that's going to be necessary. 
 We were together for 25 years. 
 We have four kids. 
 I'm sure we'll be able to figure it out. 
 Fine. What do I know? 
 I'm just 70. 
 What are you doing? 
 Setting the table. 
 Helen, the car's coming in half an hour. 
 I know. Can I just meet you there later? 
 I just got home. 
 I want to have dinner with the kids and put Stacey to bed. 
 I'll be there before the cocktails are over, okay? 
 You won't even miss me. I promise, I promise. 
 Fine. 
 Do what you like. 
 Thank you. 
 [horns honk in the distance] 
 [siren wailing in the distance] 
 Yeah, this is basically inedible, isn't it? 
 Grandma never learned how to cook. 
 I can count the number of times she made me dinner on one hand. 
 Isn't that crazy? 
 You know, in some cultures, it's considered rude not to answer your mother. 
 Oh, look, it's Justin Bieber! 
 What? Where?

 Excuse me for one second. 
 Hello, gorgeous. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 No, ma'am, I certainly wasn't always in this world. 
 I started out as a do-gooder. Helen remembers. 
 In college, all I wanted was to be a conservationist. 
 I used to drag Helen and her boyfriend with me to the High Sierra every summer so that I could hug each and every tree. 
 [laughter] 
 She hated it. 
 This Upper East Side girl eating gorp in the dark, sleeping in a tent with two smelly guys. 
 Can you imagine? 
 [laughter] 
 Actually, as I recall, Noah and I had our own... 
 Ow. 
 But when I graduated, I got a job at a local NGO, and it became painfully obvious to me very quickly that, uh... how shall I say this? 
 Money makes the world go round. 
 [laughter] 
 And so I realized that I could make more of an impact if I made a major financial contribution of my own as opposed to being chained to a desk... 
 [♪ gentle music ♪]

 [laughter] 
 You know, I always thought I was gonna plan a wedding for the two of you after graduation. 
 And when you came to me and told me you'd chosen Noah, I was shocked! 
 Mom, stop it. 
 The three of them were thick as thieves in college. 
 You couldn't tell who was dating who. 
 It kept changing all the time. 
 Well, that's not true. 
 Well, it was only true in my dreams, Mrs. B. 
 Your daughter was the coolest, prettiest girl at Williams. 
 You know, lusting after her was something of a campus activity. 
 [laughter] 
 Built school spirit. 
 I just can't believe I finally got her. 
 Anyway, I think I'm gonna double my donation to the alumni fund this year. 
 [laughter] 
 You know, Max... 
 Yeah. 
 ...if you're serious about buying in Montauk, let me introduce you to my realtor. 
 She's the absolute best. 
 The rest of them out there are just local crooks. 
 That would be wonderful, Margaret. 
 Thank you. 
 [clears throat] 
 [whispers] Here you go. 
 What is that? 
 It's a pot lozenge. 
 For later. 
 Watch your step. 
 Thank you, darling. 
 [chuckles] 
 I'm gonna let you youngsters say good night. 
 Max, it was fabulous seeing you there tonight. 
 You really must think about getting on our board. 
 You have exactly the kind of perspective we're looking for, and we are desperate for an influx of youth. 
 Oh, you flatter me, Margaret. I'm 45. 
 And I'm 62, Max. 
 We all have our weaknesses. 
 See you soon, sweetheart. 
 Good night. 
 Good night. 
 62. 
 So she had you when she was, what, 18? 
 What do you think? 
 Oh, right. I'm an idiot. 
 [laughs] 
 [thunder rumbles] 
 You should probably get inside before it starts to pour. 
 Um... 
 Thank you. 
 For being there. 
 It's my pleasure.

 Hello. 
 Jon Gottlief, counselor to Noah Solloway. 
 Is this his wife? 
 Spouses are not allowed back. 
 No, she's my associate. 
 Oh. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Noah, stop talking. 
 Who the f*ck are you? 
 I'm his lawyer. Hi, Jon Gottlief. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 I don't know what you two have been talking about, but if you even think about admitting anything he said as evidence, I will come after your badge. 
 Excuse me? 
 Get the f*ck out of my precinct. 
 You have mishandled this case from the beginning, sir. 
 The best thing I can say about you is that you're a victim of target blindness. 
 Now, if you will excuse us. 
 Noah, listen to me. 
 Your arraignment is in less than three hours. 
 We brought you a suit. 
 Keep your mouth shut. 
 [sighs] I... I can't afford you, Jon. 
 I'm paying. 
 We'll meet you at the courthouse, and we'll take care of bail. 
 Thank you.
