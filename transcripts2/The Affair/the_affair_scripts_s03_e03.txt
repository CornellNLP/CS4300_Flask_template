 Noah :  Previously on  The Affair... 
 Those of you who knew my dad will-will know that we didn't always get along so well,  but I-I loved him. 
 That was a lovely service. 
 You're coming back to the house though, aren't you? 
 Oh, uh, I don't know. 
 Do you think we should come back to the house? 
 Only if you want to. 
 How was teaching this week? You have any fun? 
 Not really. 
 I thought it was really elegant, Audrey. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 I thought it was very dull, unless it was supposed to be a satire. 
 Was it? 
 Juliette : Hello. You just popped up out of nowhere. 
 Ah,  bienvenue,  Monsieur Solloway. 
 Je suis Professeur Le Gall. 
 I'm just so pleased to finally meet you. 
 I feel that you and I are kindred spirits. 
 Woman : Silence is violence! 
 All : Silence is violence! 
 Was there a rape? 
 I'm not sure. 
 I thought I'd come to America and have a grand adventure, and instead it's, uh... 
 Instead, it's New Jersey. 
 Noah, are you all right? 
 Yeah. I'm okay. 
 Officer Santos, who knows I'm here? 
 What do you mean? 
 Noah :  I'm just wondering if it's possible for anybody still inside Fishkill to find out my current address. 
 Santos :  Why are you asking, Solloway? 
 Noah :  Never mind. It's... it's not important. 
 Aah!

 It's a lovely day, Professor. 
 Do you have anything planned? 
 Just preparing dinner for a few people tonight. 
 Oh. Coq au vin? 
 We shall see. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Professor Le Gall? We don't want to bother you. 
 We just wanted to say that we're loving your class. 
 Yeah. I thought medieval French literature was gonna be boring, but you're not boring at all. 
 Well, thank you. 
 I believe love is never boring, even 900 years ago. 
 What are you reading, Professor? 
 Oh, this I'm afraid is very boring. 
 Andreas Capellanus. 
 It's part of my research. 
 Girl : Are you enjoying your time here? 
 Boy : Are you glad you came? 
 It's very exciting to be in America. 
 Tomorrow : 
 "Lancelot, ou le Chevalier de la Charrette." 
 Come prepared with questions. 
 Okay. 
 Of course. Bye.

♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪ Audrey : How can you possibly call this an ambiguous case? Mike : She got into bed with him of her own accord. Audrey : It doesn't matter. She did not want to give Nicholas Perry a blowjob. Are you saying that you're okay with forcing a woman against her will to give you a blowjob? For f*ck's sake, Audrey. Of course I'm not saying that, but this specific lady gave no indication that she didn't want what he was giving her. Oh, I'm sorry, Mike. Were you there? She admits it herself. She does. She admits she swallowed. (GIRLS GROAN) Mike : What? Oh, come on. Grow up. Could we not just at least maybe... maybe consider the idea that she was on board here? Audrey : Mike, every two minutes someone is sexually assaulted in our country. Do you know how often the perpetrator is punished? Less than one percent. Thanks. Audrey : Thank you. Yes. And do you know why? Because it's because of this exact conversation, because we don't believe our victims. We make them feel like they asked for it. Mike : Okay. I'm just trying to have a dialogue, but if you're just gonna recite a Planned Parenthood pamphlet at me... Audrey : Oh, my God. what's the point to it? I can't believe I ever slept with you. (CHUCKLES) Okay, all right. So that's what this little tirade is really about, right? Right, Audrey? Admit it. What I will admit, Cornwall, is that I wanted to f*ck you at the time, and I regretted it after, but because I'm a cognizant human being who is able to determine and articulate my own desire, I did not bring rape charges against you, even after I found out what a giant turd you are. But if we had had s*x against my will, that would have been different. Do you understand that distinction? Yes. I understand the distinction. Do you think I'm capable of understanding that distinction? Frankly, right now I'm just terrified of you, Audrey. Oh, my God. You're a f*cking dick. Whoa! Come on. It's the coq au vin. Audrey : I'm sorry, Professor. I'm sorry. I just... he's... I-I can't. I can't... please tell me it's not like this in France. It's not at all like this in France. It's much worse. Audrey : What? Juliette : Yes. I'm afraid the whole topic is still not taken seriously. Mike :  Oui? C'est bon. You're very lucky to be surrounded by such enlightened chaps such as myself and Blake. Professor. Juliette : It's curious, though. In this case, the two parties agree on what happened. She gave him a blowjob. He didn't force her to. No, he didn't. But they don't agree on the meaning of the act. He said she wanted to. She said she didn't. Is that right? She didn't consent. But he didn't force her. Mike : No. But she didn't consent. That's very confusing, isn't it? No. Not to me. Juliette : Yes. I see that it's quite clear to you. But I live some decades now, and there's a lot about what I want that I don't understand and that I don't expect a lover to understand. Professor Le Gall, please tell me that you see the problem here. Juliette : I see problems, I do. But I think we all live in our own version of the truth, and thus we are prone to terrible miscommunications. Perhaps she was trying to communicate one thing, and he read something else. That's possible, isn't it? Yes. Of course it's possible. That's why the university needs to establish and enforce a mandate of verbal consent. I understand how such a thing would protect the university, but I don't see how s*x itself would survive. Why not? Because I am afraid the articulate is the enemy of the erotic. Isn't the whole point that you don't know what your lover will do next? That you give yourself over to a sensory experience that you haven't planned and can't control? The reason I like s*x is that I can finally, for a moment, turn off my neurotic mind and just be consumed. If I give my lover permission... yes, no, uh, touch me, not there... don't I undermine the potency of his desire? ♪♪♪ I'm sorry. You're all looking at me like I'm crazy. Do I sound crazy? No. Well, Professor Le Gall is a love expert. Professor Le Gall is a courtly love expert. Mike : What's your point? Audrey : Besides the fact that this manner of thinking has been out of date for 600 years, was written entirely by men wherein the women served as the object of male desire, but had no voice of her own. So perhaps we can forgive Professor Le Gall for assuming that the articulation of female desire is somehow anathema to sexual satisfaction. But with all due respect, Professor, I would argue that she simply never learned the appropriate language, because I can tell you exactly how I want you to f*ck me. Believe me, I remember. Audrey : And Lila can tell you exactly how she wants you to f*ck her. Hard. Audrey : And if you give me 45 minutes, I can teach Professor Le Gall to tell you exactly how she would like you to f*ck her, though you would not be given the opportunity in a million years. Oh, forgive me. I think I hear the soufflé falling. Ahh. I have to have you right now. Oh, Mike, no. speaking French No, no, no. No, no. Anybody could walk in. Who gives a f*ck? Come on. No. Mike, no. Professor... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. You... you didn't. Yes, I did. Of course I did. I behaved like a total asshole. I just... ugh, it's Noah Solloway. He just makes me so agitated. I mean, I didn't know he was gonna be here. I mean, why did you invite him? We bumped into each other on the quad, and he seemed rather lonely, so... I'm taking his class. Did I tell you that? You didn't. Well, I am, and he's a complete dick. I mean an utter asshole, and all I can do is think about f*cking him. Mike : So do it. Seriously, Audrey. What's stopping you? Jesus! That he's your professor? That he's twice your age? That he's an ex-felon? But you're so liberated. Oh, my God, Mike, why are you so obsessed with me? Mike : Obsessed with you? Audrey : Yes. I'm trying to have a private conversation with my professor. Do you mind? Yeah, I do mind, Audrey, because I was here first. Today romantic love has replaced Christianity as a doctrine for enforcing the ideal of monogamy, and the French realize all this is unrealistic. What happened to Noah? Did he leave? No. He went upstairs. He said he wasn't feeling well. Lila, tell me you agree with me. The French recognize marriage for what it is: a social construct created to protect property. I agree with that... with that one statement out of everything you said tonight. Lila : Just don't be that happy. Blake : You... you like... you just like disagreeing. (MUFFLED CONVERSATION CONTINUES) Oh, hi. Hello. I was... I was looking for a quiet space. I hope you don't mind. Are you okay? Yeah. I haven't been around that many people in a long time. Takes some getting used to again. Hmm. Are they always like that? The students? You tell me. It's your country. I am just a visiting professor. What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this? Uh, I'm here because the library claims to have unearthed certain pages from a rare manuscript that I happen to be an expert on. Really? What is it? Les Esches d'Amour. The Chess of Love. It was written in the 14th century. And this library thinks they have some missing pages. Mmm. Do they? I'm not sure yet, but if I had to wager a guess, I'd say no. How long have they got you for? I'll teach until the end of the semester. I've promised my husband I'd be home for Christmas. Long time to be away. Yes, but they gave me this generous residency, and this house, and the cutest little red car. I love that car. Is this your, uh... Yes. C'est  Etienne. With my daughter, Sabine, many years ago. She's all grown up now. She a medievalist, like her mom? No, but my husband is. A very famous one. A famous medievalist? Yes. In certain circles. That's how we met. I was his student. Do you think it's true what Audrey was saying downstairs? What was Audrey saying? That she knows exactly what she wants from her body. From men. From everything. ♪♪♪ I think Audrey is... I think Audrey is very young. Yes. But I don't ever remember feeling that confident, even when I was her age. Maybe she really does know exactly what she wants. Maybe this younger generation simply understands themselves better. Maybe the uncertainty that I've always assumed is integral to eroticism... doesn't exist for them. ♪♪♪ (EXHALES) Are you asking me if I think the kids downstairs are having better s*x than you or I? ♪♪♪ Do you? No. ♪♪♪ But they may be having more of it. ♪♪♪ I'd... I'd better go. No! Stay. What? No, no. I-I'm sorry. I'll let myself out. ♪♪♪ Where were you, Julie?

 Man : Solloway? Hey. Sorry it took me a while to get here. They never let us know who's coming through. I hope that Warden Hagan wasn't too much of a hard-ass. He can really lay down the law, but, uh, he's actually a good guy, once you get to know him. No. He was fine. Thanks. Good. You don't remember me, do you? Uh, you... uh, you look... you look familiar. I, uh... No, I don't. John Gunther. I'm from Bloomsburg. Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania? No sh1t. We've actually met. It was high school. Yeah. Swim meets. Remember All-County '85? You took the whole thing. It was impressive. I was just in the back somewhere drowning. (CHUCKLES) Sure. Yeah. I... Yeah. Ah, you don't remember me. It's okay. I've been following your career. Pretty impressive stuff. Well, it hasn't exactly worked out that well for me. Ah... sh1t happens. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Hey, look. I'm, uh, gonna keep an eye out for you, all right? Thank you. Eh. You know, over the years, I've wanted to reach out to you, but I just never really, eh... but here you are. f*cking Noah Solloway.

Let me lift your head up. There you go. (GRUNTS SOFTLY) (GROANING SIGH) Ligaya : Can you tell me what the date is today? Uh... September 24th. That's right. Do you know where you are? In the hospital. Do you know why? I had surgery. Very good. Well, you're lucky to be alive, Mr. Solloway. Wait. What happened? What... wh... How did I get here? I don't know all the details, but your wife may be able to tell you. My wife? Mm-hmm. She just stepped out to use the ladies'. She'll be so happy to see you awake. Wait. Who... who are you... who are you talking about? Can you tell me your wife's name, Mr. Solloway? Alison Bailey, but she... we're not together. Is she here? No. I believe she said a different name. Helen. You're awake. Told me you were sleeping. I just woke up. You look okay. He looks okay. Feel like sh1t, actually. Who told you I was here? Nina. I couldn't believe it. I'm sorry. I almost thought that she was joking. You said you were the wife? She's my ex. Have the police arrived yet? Police? They really should have been here by now. Why? Who did this to you? Who did what to me? Who stabbed you, Noah? What... what is she talking about? Did I get stabbed? Why doesn't he know that? I'm-I'm very sorry, Mr. Solloway. You were attacked by someone with a knife. You bled profusely. They took you to surgery where Dr. Quittner closed the artery off. Jesus. You were very lucky. The blade missed your airway, and your jugular vein, and just nicked your artery. Helen : Who did this to you? I don't know. I-I-I don't remember. You can't remember anything? No. Well, why not? I mean why can't he remember? I'm not sure, Mrs. Solloway. When is the surgeon coming back? 'Cause I'd like to speak to him. They found you in some student's apartment? I'm renting it. And you really don't remember anything? I remember washing dishes late at night... Well, why were you washing dishes so late? Could this have been an accident? Maybe I f-fell or something. It was a knife, Noah. A f*cking knife sliced into your throat. (SIGHS) Okay. Helen : Are you sure that he doesn't have any brain damage or something? He had a CAT scan, and the result came back normal. Somebody tried to kill you. Do you understand? Trevor : Can we come in now? sh1t, Dad. Are you all right? Hey, kids. I've been better. Everything's gonna be okay. Does this thing have a massage feature? Your dad's right. He's going to be fine. He should be home in a couple of days. He doesn't live with us. Ligaya : Um, Mr. Solloway, I need to ask you a few more questions. I'm sorry. And then I'll let you rest. Can you tell me, do you have a history of any previous surgeries? He had his appendix out ten years ago. That's it, unless you count his wisdom teeth. No. I think you were what, 25 or 26? Ligaya : It's not relevant. What about medications? Helen : No. He doesn't... Are you currently taking any? Helen : He hates medication. He won't even take Tylenol when he has a fever. I'm on Vicodin. What? Ligaya : Dosage? 7.5 milligrams. I had a shoulder injury. I'm... the pain gets pretty bad. Is that getting worse? Who's treating you? I have a prescription, Helen. From who? Ligaya : That's all I need for now. Is there anything I can get for you, Mr. Solloway? No. Thank you very much. Stacey : Can we go now? That's a good idea. Your father could use some rest. Helen : Can you bring your sister down to the cafeteria and get her something to eat and I'll meet you guys there, okay? Trevor : But I don't have any money. Helen : Nothing too sweet. Could you get a few more blankets? It's freezing in here. Ligaya : Sure. What happened to you? Helen, I really need to sleep. ♪♪♪ You can stay, but just please stop talking. ♪♪♪

(PLASTIC CUP CRINKLING) Don't think I'll be able to help you much. I don't remember a thing. Well, can you say what you do remember? I was at the sink washing dishes, and then I'm here being told someone stabbed me in the neck. And you have no idea who might have done that to you? No. Look. We've been by the apartment, and we got our guys over there now. And so far we've seen no signs of a forced entry, so would you happen to recall whether or not you locked the door? (PLASTIC CUP CRINKLING) (GROANS) Uh... I might have or not. I couldn't... why? Do you think this was a robbery? Unlikely. Yeah. Not with the nature of the injury. The fact that he went for the neck, I mean, that tells us that the assailant meant to do real harm. Yeah. Well, he succeeded. Stanton : Mr. Solloway, we're treating this attack as an attempted homicide. Jesus. (PLASTIC CUP CONTINUES CRINKLING) What the f*ck? What about the kid? What kid? Uh, the frat guy. Regers or the guy I sublet... Dan? Dan Regan? Right. Could they have been after him? Mr. Regan's at the station. He's cooperating. Yeah, I mean, plus, you know, like you say, he's a 20-year-old Delta Phi kid, and you just finished three years at Fishkill. You're a public figure. (CUP CRINKLING STOPS) Stanton : So if either one of you was gonna be targeted, we're gonna lean towards you. I mean, would you agree with that? Fine. Romero : Try to think then. Is there anyone out there that's got a gripe with you? Might want to harm you? (SCOFFS) What's your relationship like with Cole Lockhart these days? We don't have one. When's the last time you had any contact with Mr. Lockhart? I don't know. Years ago. The trial, I guess. Brother's murder trial? Right. Stanton : Yeah, well, between what happened to his brother and the affair with his wife, Cole is definitely a person of interest. But, um, what about Alison Bailey? ♪♪♪ What about her? Stanton : You're still married. Yes. But estranged. Wow. You guys know everything about me, don't you? Does she still have any feelings left for you? How the f*ck do I know? Well, what we're trying to figure out is if she'd have a problem with you seeing other women. Lucky for her, I've been incarcerated the last three years, and since I got out I've been a f*cking monk, so... Ah, so, um, Ms., um, Le Gall? ♪♪♪ (SIGHS) Ms. Le who? Stanton : Yeah. Juliette Le Gall. The woman who found you and brought you in. ♪♪♪ Juliette found me? Yeah. Juliette found you at 1:38 a. m. What's your relationship with her? Well, we met yesterday. I barely know her. And yet she was at your house at one... No, no, no. She wasn't at my house. I was at her house with several other people, and then I left. Ligaya : Everything okay in here? Yeah, we're good. Yeah. We'll be done in just a minute. Look, Mr. Solloway, we're all on the same side here. If you just relax... Relax? Someone tried to f*cking kill me, and you got nothing. You have no f*cking clue who might actually have done this. And when you say "actually"... Can you ask them to go? Just go and do their jobs? Will you do that for me, please?

I actually don't remember it happening. Strange. I'm afraid I've also forgotten... why you were there. You didn't forget. You weren't expecting me. I'm sorry to have scared you.
