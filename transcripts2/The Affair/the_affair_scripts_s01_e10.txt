 Previously on  The Affair... 
 You have to talk to your mother. 
 She has something to tell you about the ranch. 
 It's worthless. 
 Please stay. 
 But I'll die if I stay any longer. 
 I don't want to die. 
 Ali, wait, wait. 
 Let's get the f*ck out of here. 
 [Tire pops] 
 All right, dude. You're all set. 
 And here's my number. 
 Great. 
 Just in case you ever get in trouble out here again. 
 You found a pregnancy test? 
 Yes. In the garbage. 
 Whitney, we know you're pregnant. 
 I already have it taken care of. 
 I have an abortion set up for tomorrow. 
 Who did this to you? 
 No one. Who cares? 
 I care. 
 Uh, I'm here looking for Whitney Solloway. 
 She's 17. 
 Hey, hey, hey... we're friends, okay? 
 f*ck you! 
 I don't want this life. 
 I have to leave. 
 I'm in love with someone else. 
 I did it. 
 I left Helen.

 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Long time no see. 
 Sure is. How you been? 
 I'm good. Engaged. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I-I have no idea why I just told you that. 
 Well, I'm separated, so... 
 That's too bad. 
 Yeah, it really is.

 Have a seat. 
 Never finished that one. 
 Nobody ever has. 
 You think you'll be the first? 
 It's actually my second time through. 
 Victor. 
 Noah. 
 [Sighs] 
 What are you here for? 
 Disorderly conduct. 
 You? 
 I was advised that a serious allegation had been levied against me, and pending the outcome of the investigation, I was to report here. 
 When was that? 
 Two years ago. 
 Two years ago? 
 The arbitrators who were supposed to oversee my case quit because the city hadn't paid them for several years, so until they work that out... 
 [Snores] 
 What do you do all day? 
 You're looking at it. 
 Hey, man, can I go get a paper? 
 Sure, if you quit your job. 
 What? 
 If you want to quit your job, you can leave whenever you want, but if you want to keep your tenure, you're here till 3:15, bud. 
 What if I need to take a piss? 
 Give me your driver's license, and I give you a hall pass. 
 I've got a copy of  Crime and Punishment  in my bag. 
 No, thanks. 
 That was a joke.

 It's extraordinary. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 Michi Kakutani will flip for this, and she hates everything. 
 So you... you want to publish it? 
 I do. 
 I want it in stores by next fall. 
 You want to talk money? 
 Sure. 
 Okay. 
 I think I can get you something in the low six-figures. 
 How's that sound? 
 That sounds amazing. 
 See, what you really should've done... you should've found yourself an agent who could've sent this out to a few of us at once and create something of a bidding war. 
 f*ck. 
 I'm gonna do it for you. 
 I'll get Alena to start a rumor internally that HarperCollins is also reading it, and maybe we can up them to half a mil. 
 She works for you? 
 Yup. 
 Jesus. 
 Yeah. 
 Trying to get her assigned to another desk. 
 Why? 
 Because I know myself, Noah. 
 And not everyone has a wife as hot as yours. 
 Helen and I just separated. 
 What? 
 No. Since when? 
 It's been almost four months. 
 Wow, you seemed like one of the strong ones. 
 Well, no one ever really knows what's going on in anyone else's marriage, right? 
 Did you leave her? 
 Uh, yeah. But then she kicked me out. 
 So you're a single man again. 
 I guess so. 
 What's it like? 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 It's not that great. She's so mad at me. 
 So are the kids, at least the older ones. 
 I lost half my friends. 
 I live in a place the size of your desk. 
 I basically lost my job. 
 That sounds wonderful. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Nobody checking up on you, wondering what time you're gonna be home, how much money you made this month, what did you spent it on? 
 You could fly to Cancun tonight. 
 You could f*ck a co-ed, and you could just... you could keep going. 
 Well, I do still have my kids, Harry. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 I mean, you don't have to answer this if you don't want to. 
 Sure. 
 You miss your wife? 
 Not yet. 
 So that's it? That's all you wanted to know? 
 Some sh1t about my car? 
 That's it. 
 Unless there's something else you'd like to tell me. 
 Well, if you're ever curious about my bike, you know where to find me. 
 99 Greenwich Ave, right? 
 Fancy. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Do you have any leads yet, Detective? 
 Nothing that's panned out yet. 
 Wow. 
 You're really doing a crackerjack job here, aren't you? 
 Listen, as much as I enjoy spending time with you, I didn't kill Scotty Lockhart. 
 Now, I wish I could help you just so I could stop coming in here, but I've told you everything I know about it. 
 Thank you for your time, Mr. Solloway. 
 Hey. Hey! 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Where are you? 
 Okay, I'll be right there. 
 When did you get that? 
 Hey, I'm here looking for Whitney Solloway. 
 She's 17. 
 Hey, hey, hey... we're friends, okay? 
 f*ck you! 
 She's f*cking 17! 
 [Overlapping shouting] 
 Hey! 
 I'm gonna f*cking kill you. 
 [Turns off TV] 
 My mother hired a private investigator. 
 What? Why? 
 To build a case against you in divorce proceedings. 
 I thought we were taking a break. 
 He's really very good. 
 He has all the names of all the girls you took home, and he's got files on them in his dossier. 
 He actually says that, used that word "dossier." 
 Oh, Jesus Christ, Helen. 
 And the rubber room... when were you gonna tell me about that? 
 Never. 
 Why not? 
 'Cause it's none of your f*cking business. 
 I'm still getting my full f*cking salary. 
 You think that's what I care about? 
 How could you let your mother hire a private investigator? 
 I don't let my mother do anything. 
 My mother does whatever the f*ck she wants to do, and she does not ask my permission. 
 So is that why you called me up here, to see how you're gonna divorce me? 
 What is wrong with you? 
 What's wrong with me? 
 Yeah, what's wrong with you? 
 Scotty Lockhart was f*cking our daughter, and you don't tell me? 
 When was I supposed to f*cking tell you? You threw me out of the house. 
 Bullshit! f*ck you! You are protecting yourself... 
 Now you're gathering evidence against me, so you can take my children! 
 You think, for one moment, that some judge is gonna look at that tape of a father defending his daughter and see some violent man who doesn't deserve custody of his children? 
 I hate you so much! 
 If you want to divorce me, that's one thing, but that sh1t is f*cking beneath you. 
 I don't want to divorce you, you asshole! 
 You don't? 
 No. 
 Well, what do you want? 
 I want you to come home. 
 I miss you. 
 I can't do this alone. 
 I hate my life without you. 
 You know... you know... you know, you used to like me because of how I am. 
 I mean, I thought you chose me for the way I am. 
 You did. 
 You did. You wanted a certain life. 
 And I gave that to you. 
 You were tired of being poor. 
 You wanted a big family. I could've stopped that too. 
 I didn't need to have four kids to try to make up for the wasteland that was my childhood. 
 You know, you never gave me a chance. 
 You never said, "I'm different now." 
 "I want something else." 
 You just took it all away. 
 But I can change. I can change. 
 And I have been working with Dr. Gunderson two times a week, and I have new tools now. 
 Helen, Helen, stop, stop. Just stop, stop. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 [Cries] 
 All gonna be okay. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 Did you just wipe your snot all over my shirt? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Do you think that's hot? 
 [Chuckles] 
 What time are you talking to Jeffries? 
 Now, man. 
 What does he want from you? 
 I have no idea. 
 He's gonna ask about me. 
 Specifically about my car. 
 Why? 
 It doesn't matter. I need you to say nothing. 
 You never met me. You never fixed my car. 
 What's that worth? 
 How about 10 grand? Will that do it? 
 No, but 20 will. 
 Okay, fine. 
 I'll get you the cash tomorrow. 
 Oh, come on, man. Give me a break. 
 You know, you got to give me the cash today. 
 Okay, fine. 
 I'll wire it to you right now. 
 Damn, man. 
 You must be in some deep sh1t. 
 It's all gonna be fine. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Dad, what are you doing here? 
 Your dad found out that your boyfriend last summer was not Jack. 
 How? 
 Whitney, why did you lie to me? 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, because I thought you'd be upset. 
 I am. I'm very upset, and I... we're gonna press charges. 
 For what? 
 For statutory rape. 
 Well, that's ridiculous. 
 I'm 17. 
 You were 16 when it happened, and he's 30 at least. 
 He's probably older than that. 
 Are you serious about this? 
 I'm very serious. 
 Was this your idea? 
 Whitney, what this guy did was a crime. 
 No, it wasn't. It was consensual. 
 He took advantage of you. 
 I'm telling you. 
 I asked him to. 
 He's 15 years older than you. 
 How old is Alison? 
 Really? 
 What, you thought she wasn't gonna tell me, Dad? 
 What was she supposed to say? You grew apart? 
 Jesus, I can't believe you or you. 
 You said it was over. 
 You said you would never forgive him. 
 Well, it's not that simple. 
 You said he was a bad person who had deliberately ruined our lives. 
 You said he might be a sociopath. 
 I was angry. 
 Well, I had to live with that. 
 I had to go see dad all the time and act like everything was normal, all the time wondering, "is he a sociopath?" 
 Come on. Now, look. 
 I never should have said that. 
 I'm sorry. I apologize. 
 You... you're a hypocrite. 
 You think you can just walk back in here after four months of not being here and be my parent? 
 I am your parent. 
 Now, you may not like that or me, but I'm still your dad. 
 And by the way, we're not asking permission here. 
 We're telling you what's about to happen. 
 Is that clear? 
 You can't do that. 
 I love him. 
 I don't care, Whit. 
 You are a sociopath! 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks a lot for that. 
 [Door squeaks] 
 She okay? 
 Not really. 
 Told you this was a bad idea. 
 Which part? 
 You know, maybe we should... maybe we should just let it go. 
 I mean, she obviously knew what she was doing. 
 She was almost 17. 
 I'm gonna press charges. You can join me or not. 
 [Rummaging in the background] 
 Did you just change in the bathroom? 
 Yeah. 
 Why? 
 I don't know, Noah. 
 Should I leave? 
 No. 
 Please don't. 
 [Ringtone playing] 
 [Phone dings, vibrates] 
 Okay, everybody, we'll be back by tonight, and you be good for grandma, okay? 
 Where are you going? 
 Going on a little trip. 
 Where's Whitney? 
 She's at her friend's house. 
 Is dad living with us again? 
 I don't want to talk about that right now. 
 I have an idea... Why don't you and I go pick up Whitney? 
 Noah can spend the day with his children, who clearly miss him. 
 Mom, you said you would watch them. 
 And I'd be happy to, but considering the predicament our Whitney finds herself in, I just wonder if her father is the appropriate role model. 
 Are you kidding me, Margaret? 
 Don't. 
 You think this situation is somehow my fault. 
 Please don't. Please. 
 No, you and Bruce have the worst values in the Western world. 
 You've been filling Whitney's head with your toxic, narcissistic bullshit since she was a child, and you stand there judging me? 
 I'm sorry, Noah. What would you like me to do? 
 Congratulate you on finally revealing yourself to be the useless asshole I always suspected you were? 
 Stop yelling at dad! 
 Yeah, stop it! 
 Guys, just go. We'll be fine. 
 Thank you, honey. 
 Bye. 
 You know what I just figured out? 
 What? 
 I was so afraid of marrying my father, I never realized I was marrying my mother. 
 [Snickers] 
 [Sighs] 
 Perfect. 
 Where is she? 
 Inside with my mother-in-law. 
 Is Scotty in there? 
 No. 
 He's... he's gone. 
 Gone where? 
 I don't know. 
 [Dishes clinking] 
 Mr. Solloway, hello. Mrs. Solloway, hi. 
 I'm Cherry Lockhart. 
 You f*cking traitor. 
 I thought we were friends. 
 Can we just sit down? 
 And we'll just talk this through, okay? 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 I'm taking my daughter, and I'm going home. 
 I know you want to, but can we just speak? 
 I just want to say that I did not realize what was going on this past summer between my son and... 
 I mean, if I'd known, I obviously would have put a stop to it. 
 He's much too old for her. 
 Yes, I agree. 
 Whitney, come on. 
 Can I just ask? 
 Have you called the police? 
 No, not yet. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Please don't. Please? 
 I know my son. 
 He's been a struggle all along, but I promise you he never meant to hurt your daughter. 
 He... Scotty... he just doesn't think. 
 Obviously. 
 Please don't press charges. 
 Please? We just lost this ranch. 
 We're all gonna be homeless at the end of the month, and I can give you my vow... my solemn vow... you will never see him again. 
 He will never be anywhere near your daughter... 
 All right, this is way too f*cked up, okay? 
 Whitney, we are going right now. 
 No, there's no arguments. 
 Stop! I don't... 
 Let's go. And, you, stop staring at him. 
 What the f*ck is wrong with you? 
 Please don't speak that way to my daughter-in-law... not in this house. 
 Your daughter-in-law was f*cking my husband. 
 I know. She's done a terrible thing. 
 Many people in this room have done terrible things, so I think maybe what would be best is if we all just forgive each other and say good-bye. 
 Whitney, you have to go home now. 
 Let's go. 
 Stop it, stop. 
 [Door closes] 
 Did you get rid of her, Mom? 
 sh1t. 
 You f*cking... 
 I'll kill you! f*cking come here! 
 f*cking kill you! 
 Get the f*ck off me! 
 f*cking scumbag! 
 I'm gonna kill you! 
 [Shouts] 
 [Gags] 
 f*cking scumbag! 
 God! 
 f*ck! 
 [Gunshot] 
 Get the f*ck off my brother. 
 f*ck. 
 [Coughs] 
 Give me one good reason why I shouldn't blow your f*cking brains out right now, 'cause I can't think of one.

 What's it today, Maurice? 
 I call it "vegan surprise". 
 Namaste. 
 Namaste. 
 Namaste. 
 Namaste. 
 Namaste. 
 So I think I found someone for you. 
 Oh, Athena, please. 
 Just hear me out. 
 He's 6'2". He's very clean. 
 Clean? 
 He's around your age. He's an entrepreneur. He came by my practice yesterday. He was trying to sell me these hemp bars that he had made, which were delicious. And we got to talking, and I found out he's recently divorced. He's from the city, but he rented a little cabin up here to regroup and get his life back together, just like someone else I know. 
 Athena... 
 I found him very centered, Alison. He really looked me in the eye as he was talking to me. He was trying to sell you hemp bars. And generous. He gave me a few to try for free. Oh, his phone number's on the back. 
 Oh! Look at that. 
 I feel like he could provide you with a very healing sexual experience, sweetie. 
 I don't need that. 
 I'm a very big advocate for celibacy between relationships as a kind of palate cleanser. 
 Oh, thank you, Dennis. 
 In the program, abstention from sexual involvement or intrigue is highly recommended for recovery. 
 Well, she's not an addict, baby. 
 She's recovering from toxic dynamics. 
 You've grown so much here. 
 Don't leave. Stay a little longer. 
 I can't. 
 It's almost summer again, and I have to deal with the house. 
 Is Cole still there? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 I think so. 
 Gonna stay at Phoebe's tonight and go over tomorrow. 
 Tell her hi. 
 I will do. 
 Oh, God. I got to go. I'm gonna miss my train. But I'll take this just in case. 
 Thank you, Athena. Thank you. 
 For a second, I thought you might actually call me mom. 
 [Laughing] 
 
 
 
 So what the hell happened? 
 I take off for a year, and you decide to leave your husband? 
 I met someone. 
 What? 
 Who? 
 His name is Noah. 
 Where? 
 Uh... he came into the Lobster Roll with his wife and four kids. 
 Oh, Jeez. 
 Yeah. 
 And? 
 And we had an affair. 
 Cole found out. Actually Cherry found out first. 
 Then Cole found out. It was a disaster. 
 Whoa. 
 Yeah. 
 Whoa. 
 I know. 
 So you're not still seeing him? 
 No. 
 You going back to Cole? 
 No. 
 I think I want to be alone. 
 Have you ever been alone? 
 No, I haven't. 
 It's all very glamorous until you need a kidney. 
 What, do you need a kidney? 
 No. 
 But if I did, who would I call? 
 You can take one of mine. 
 I mean, that's the kind of stuff you start to think about when you spend too much time alone. 
 I mean, is it any worse than being lonely in your own marriage? 
 I don't know. I've never been married. 
 You know? 
 There was this time, this moment very... there was this moment at the very beginning when I was walking away from Noah, and he grabbed my hand, and he pulled me back to him. 
 And he just looked at me. 
 He really just... he looked at me. 
 It was the most perfect, erotic moment of my life. 
 And I sometimes feel like everything that's happened since is just us circling each other, trying to get back to that moment, and... 
 Yeah. But you never can. 
 Why not? 
 Because it wasn't real. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I just came to pick up Phoebe. We're gonna go surfing together. 
 How are you? How have you been? 
 Fine. I'm totally fine. 
 That's good. 
 Yeah, everything's great. 
 Sorry, I'm just looking for my wet suit. 
 I thought I hung it up by the shower, but it's not there. 
 How's Hal? 
 He's fine. 
 Cherry? 
 She's fine too. 
 Did you sell the ranch? 
 We lost it last week, actually. 
 [Sighs] 
 We have to be out by the end of the month. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't know. 
 Yeah, you're really out of the loop. 
 Well, it's good to see you. 
 I've missed you. 
 If I had known that you were here, I would've waited in the car. 
 Really? 
 Yes, really. 
 Alison, you walked out on your family. 
 Now that you've decided to swing back into town, you just want to pick up where you left off? 
 No, I'm sorry. It doesn't work like that. 
 Well, how does it work? 
 I don't know, but not like that. 
 Found it. Sorry. 
 Ready to go? 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 What about you? 
 Do you want to come? 
 She doesn't surf. 
 Well, you're welcome to stay here for the morning. 
 I'll leave you my key. 
 No, I have to go to the house. 
 Can you drop me? 
 Is that all right? 
 Just take me to my house, MK, and then you never have to see me again. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Cole. 
 Guys headed out? 
 It's pumping out there this morning. 
 Hey. 
 Staying at Phoebe's? 
 That's right. 
 It's nice having her back, isn't it? 
 Hey, this place looks great. 
 Yeah, I fixed it up. 
 I did a bunch of work on it while you were gone. 
 Turned pretty well. 
 It should help you when you try to sell it. 
 This was a bad idea. 
 How's your mom? 
 The same. 
 How's yours? 
 Well, we finally lost the ranch. 
 I heard. 
 So understandably, she's a mess. 
 Right. 
 Sorry. 
 Where are you gonna go? 
 I don't know. 
 Thanks for returning my phone calls... 
 Cole... and my texts. 
 Look, I couldn't. I'm sorry. I... 
 You know, it just amazes me that after 20 years, you really think that you know somebody, but it turns out you don't know them at all. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 Why don't you know what to say? 
 You've had four f*cking months to figure it out. 
 Why come back here if you don't know what to say? 
 Oh, my God. 
 I cannot f*cking believe you. 
 You didn't come back to talk to me at all, did you? 
 It's almost summer. 
 You came back to sell the f*cking house. 
 [Sighs] 
 Wait, what if I sold it to you? 
 What? 
 Look, you love this place. 
 You should have it. Make me an offer. 
 I'm broke, Ali. You know that. 
 Well, then I'll give it to you. 
 I'll sign the deed over to you. 
 That would make you a f*cking idiot. 
 I just want you to have something that you love. 
 I love you. 
 I don't know how to fix what's broken between us, Cole. 
 I-I don't think it's fixable. 
 Okay, what if we go see another therapist? 
 It's not gonna bring him back. 
 I know that. 
 And that is the only thing that can fix this for me. 
 No. 
 I look at you. 
 And I see his face. 
 People survive this. They do. 
 You know that. It's incredibly hard, but they survive together. 
 They heal together. 
 I don't want to. 
 It's too hard. I don't want to do it. 
 Is this about him? 
 Are you with him now? 
 No. 
 I haven't talked to him since I last talked to you. 
 It's not about him. It's about me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I am so, so sorry Gabriel died. 
 I don't know what we did to deserve that. 
 We loved him. We took good care of him. 
 But he's gone, and I see him all over your face and your body. 
 You've changed for me. 
 What are you saying, Alison, that you want to forget about him? 
 No. 
 Forget about you. 
 Why weren't you watching him? 
 Excuse me? 
 I went to get a blanket. 
 I left you alone for three minutes. 
 How could you have let him go under? 
 Why wouldn't you just take him to the f*cking hospital? 
 I'm gonna go surfing, and when I come back to this house, I want you out of here, and I never want to see you again. 
 Oh, good. Thank God you're still here. 
 You have to come with me. 
 What? 
 That Solloway girl is here. 
 Cherry's been trying to call you. 
 She's at the ranch, and she's looking for Scotty. 
 Why? 
 Just will you come with me, please? 
 Quickly. I'll explain in the car. 
 You too. 
 Hi. 
 Sorry to drag you both into this. 
 Tell them what you just told me. 
 Scotty and I were together for a while, and my parents just found out, and now they want to charge him with statutory rape. 
 What? 
 Yeah, look. 
 It's not about him. 
 They're going through something, as I'm sure you'd know. 
 Hold on a second. You and Scotty? 
 Yes. 
 Where is he? 
 Look, this isn't his fault. You shouldn't blame him. 
 How old are you? 
 What differences does it make? 
 How old are you? 
 I'm 17. 
 Oh, Jesus Christ. 
 What do we do? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe if I just speak to your mother as a mother, I appeal to her sympathy... she has sons of her own. 
 No, that'll never work. 
 My mom pays lawyers to do her talking. 
 Does she know where you are right now? 
 No, I don't think so. 
 Well, maybe you could call her. 
 Get her to pick you up, and then Cherry could have the conversation in person. 
 Why don't you call him? 
 Why? 
 We don't know that your mother's behind this. 
 If I was your father, I would want to kill Scotty. 
 We need to talk to him together, and if you call him, he'll come. 
 And what if he comes alone? 
 Oh, please. 
 She'll never let that happen. 
 She's already made that mistake once. 
 I-I don't want to do this. 
 I don't give a sh1t what you want, Alison. 
 Make the call. 
 Fine. 
 I need you to say nothing. 
 You never met me. You never fixed my car. 
 What's that worth? 
 How about 10 grand? Will that do it? 
 No, but 20 will. 
 Okay, fine. 
 Nice work, Jake. 
 All right, let's finish the affidavit and get it in. 
 So do I get to keep the money? 
 No, man, you forfeit that to us in cash. 
 Cash? 
 But you didn't call the IRS, right? 
 No, and I'm not going to. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Look, man, I got two kids at home and another one on the way. 
 I can't afford to lose my business. 
 You better stop taking money under the table, man. 
 It's way too easy for me to find that out. 
 Hey, yeah, you got it. Listen, thanks again, man. 
 Yeah. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Keys clack] 
 Hey, I'm here looking for Whitney Solloway. 
 She's 17. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 [Both shouting indistinctly] 
 I'm gonna kill you! 
 Hey, you need to relax! 
 Come on! 
 You need to calm down! 
 Steve's on the line. He says it's urgent. 
 Thank you, Esther. 
 Hey, babe, what's up? 
 So were you really screwing my dad? 
 Yeah. 
 Why? 
 He's so old, and your husband's so hot. 
 [Car approaching] 
 They're here. 
 Cherry, they're here. 
 f*ck. 
 You want to get it? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 Where is she? 
 Uh, she's inside. She doesn't want to come out. 
 Well, she doesn't have a f*cking choice. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Where's Cherry? 
 I asked her to give us a second. 
 She'll be here soon. 
 All right, the party's over. Okay? 
 No, No. Mrs. Lockhart wants to talk to you. 
 Well, I have no interest in talking to her, so we're leaving, okay? 
 No, no. 
 Whitney. 
 I'm not gonna leave. Dad, no. 
 Get the f*ck up now, Whitney. 
 Wow, that's how you talk to your kids. 
 You know, I pegged you as more of a family man, the mild-mannered professor. 
 Stop. 
 But clearly there's another side to you, which actually makes more sense, 'cause she sure as sh1t does not respond to kindness. 
 I can tell you that. 
 Listen, man, I know you got a lot to be upset about. 
 Yes, I do. 
 And if you want to talk to me another time, then we should do that, but right now, I'm just gonna take my daughter and go home. 
 I just want to take my wife and go home. 
 She won't go with me anymore. 
 What do you think I should do about that? 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know. 
 That's between you and her to figure out. 
 Whitney, if you're not in that car in 60 seconds... 
 No, no! Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad! 
 Cole, Cole. What are you doing? 
 Not exactly sure yet. 
 Look, put the gun away, please. 
 I don't think I'm gonna do that. 
 Look, man, whatever this is about, just let my family walk out of here, okay? 
 What do you think this is about, asshole? 
 You f*cked my wife, didn't you? 
 Didn't you? Yes or no. 
 I did. 
 Well, how would you feel if I f*cked your wife? 
 Cole, please. 
 Stay out of this. 
 Put the gun... 
 I said shut the f*ck up. 
 There's only one thing left in this world that I still care about, and that's her. 
 Does that mean anything to you? 
 Does anything mean anything to you? 
 Does she? 
 [All screaming] 
 Does she? 
 Listen to me, man! 
 Listen to you. Listen to you? 
 A married man with four children takes advantage of a woman who just lost her only child, and you want me to listen to you, you sick f*ck? 
 Cole, listen to me. It's not him you're angry at. 
 I'm my own person. 
 I make my own decisions. 
 He did not take me away from you. 
 I chose him. 
 So, please, if you want to shoot someone, shoot me. 
 If you want to kill somebody, kill me, please. 
 Please. 
 Okay. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, well, maybe I should just shoot myself. 
 [Gasps] 
 [Sighs] 
 Let you have this image burned into your mind for the rest of your life. 
 You'll be stuck with it like we're both stuck with him. 
 Does that sound like a good idea? 
 No, no. No. 
 He wouldn't want this. 
 Please, if he... if he was here, he would be so scared... 
 But he's not here. 
 Yes, he is. 
 He is here. He's here every day. 
 He's here with me every day. I know he's with you. 
 I know. 
 He loved you so much. 
 He wanted to be you. 
 Please, he'd want you to be happy. 
 He'd want me to be happy. 
 Please. 
 We can't let him down. Please. 
 Please.

 [Door slams] 
 Come on, let's get the f*ck out of here. 
 Are you coming? 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 [Sighs] 
 She asleep? 
 I think so. 
 You look so pretty. 
 Don't. 
 You do. 
 What's your day look like tomorrow? 
 Nuts. Yours? 
 Jammed. 
 Can you be here when Julianne leaves? 
 No, I'm having dinner with that actor. 
 You're kidding. 
 Yeah, he wants to talk about his character or something. 
 He's so famous. Where you gonna go? 
 Don't know. Probably his hotel. 
 Harry's setting something up. 
 Noah Solloway. 
 I know. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm proud of you. You know that? 
 Thanks.

 Oh, sh1t.

 Okay.

 I promise. 
 Let's go.
