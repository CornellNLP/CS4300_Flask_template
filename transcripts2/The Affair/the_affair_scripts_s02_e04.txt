 Alison :  Previously on  The Affair... 
 Helen :  Are you living with her? 
 Noah :  No, Helen, I'm not. 
 I don't want her anywhere near my kids. 
 Well, you might not get to have everything you want, Helen. 
 I saw this in a shop window, and I thought how beautiful it would look on your finger. 
 Yes, I want to marry you. 
 Whitney. 
 What's  she  doing here? 
 I thought you weren't living together. 
 You have a family. 
 Take off the ring, bitch! 
 Just stop! 
 Take the f*cking... 
 Stop that! Stop it! 
 Alison :  Do you think we're making a mistake? 
 My whole life I've been afraid of what other people think of me, and I'm done. 
 It's a pot lozenge. For later. 
 She can't know I'm living with Alison. 
 Don't worry, Dad. I got you. 
 I am sending an email to my accountant and telling him to send you $50,000. 
 I don't want to take any more money off you. 
 Noah, take it. 
 The sooner you and Helen get divorced, the happier everyone will be. 
 Are you Noah Solloway? This is an action for divorce. 
 You're being served.

 Gottlief :  On Saturday, May 9th, Noah Solloway returned to his wife and family  expressing regret and dismay over his recent betrayal and asserted his wish to rebuild their... 
 Previously happy... Life together. 
 The very next day, May 10th... 
 After an unfortunate incident in which the husband of his paramour pulled out a gun right in front of his 17-year-old daughter, Mr. Solloway returned abruptly, impulsively, right back into the arms of said paramour. 
 He has done nothing but lie to, neglect, and traumatize my client and her four children ever since. 
 Mr. Solloway has opted to live in a single-room cabin some 60 miles outside of the city. 
 60? You said six-zero? 
 I did, Your Honor. That's correct. Six-zero. 
 Way up the Hudson in... What is it? 
 Cold Spring, New York. 
 Which is just temporary, Your Honor. 
 Gottlief : Right. 
 He purports that it's just temporary, that it's all he can afford, that he needs to finish his book, that he needs the peace and quiet, et cetera, et cetera. 
 Meanwhile, two months later, the book still isn't finished, the cabin still has one room, still over an hour away from his kids, but we digress. 
 Mr. Solloway has also purported, in the presence of a mediator, documented, that he was living alone when, in fact... as discovered by his 17-year-old daughter, sadly just last week... 
 He has been cozied up there with his paramour, cohabitating with his paramour, and even, shockingly, fantastically, has proposed to this paramour despite the fact that he's still married to the mother of his four children. 
 Maybe it's just me, but I have to ask why a man who claims to want shared custody of his four children who claims that he can't afford suitable housing for these children is spending money he does not have on a diamond engagement ring. 
 Your Honor... 
 Now, to me, there is absolutely no question, no doubt whatsoever that Whitney and Trevor and Martin and Stacey would be so much better off in the full custody of their mother. 
 Visitation? Absolutely, of course. 
 But are we really going to ask these four kids to split their time, to camp out way up in the... in the woods three, four times a week when they have a whole brownstone all to themselves? 
 A beautiful home right around the corner from their school, right next to their friends? 
 Hold it. 
 Gottlief : Yes, please. 
 Did you say your client lives in a brownstone? 
 That is correct, with her four children. 
 Judge Polk : A whole brownstone you said? 
 Gottlief : Well, yes, but I don't think that that's... 
 Does your client own this "whole brownstone"? 
 Gottlief : Not outright, Your Honor. 
 It was purchased through a trust in 2003. 
 And the neighborhood? 
 I'm sorry? 
 Judge Polk : Where does your client live? 
 Park Slope. 
 Ah. 
 The lovely Park Slope. 
 And, uh, this building is worth approximately... 
 Do we know? 
 Very difficult to say... 
 $3,175,000. Give or take. 
 That's off of recent sales, comparable properties in the area. 
 Judge Polk : Right. 
 The kids' school around the corner, is that a private school? 
 Amazing. 
 Four judges in rotation, and we get stuck with the one committed Bolshevik? 
 I thought you said Noah didn't want your parents' money. 
 That's what he said in mediation. 
 Was this before or after the Walden shtick? 
 "I just want to sit by my pond, me and my lonely laptop." 
 [sighs] We're gonna have to get together before next Friday, your mother, your father, you, Ed Rhinehold, go over everything, every asset, every... 
 sh1t. I got a lunch back in the city. 
 Are you gonna be okay? 
 Maybe. 
 If you stop saying "paramour." 
 If I... 
 I mean, what the f*ck is that, Jon? 
 You said it 14 times. 
 Well, it happens to be the legal term for it, but if you prefer, I could say "concubine," "f*ck buddy"? 
 "Slut face"? 
 How about "c**t"? 
 c**t works for me. 
 Got it. I'll do that. 
 [cell phone buzzing] 
 I hate him so much. 
 Tell your folks I'll see them on Friday. 
 [cell phone buzzing] 
 [cell phone whooshing] 
 There you are. 
 Well, what do we think? 
 Of what? 
 Very funny. 
 Six minutes, Whitney. 
 Isn't your train at one? 
 1:40. 
 I told Augusto where I was going. 
 Somehow he'd never heard of Bryn Mawr, but he's foreign, so I forgave that. 
 When I told him about my 50th reunion, Augusto understood completely. 
 I'm transformed. 
 Noah wants money. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Were you gonna ask how the hearing went, or would you like to talk about your hairdo some more? 
 I was. Of course I was going to ask. 
 I just assumed it went smoothly. 
 Well, it didn't. 
 When we were in mediation, it was going smoothly. 
 Now that we're in f*cking court, he's going for half of everything. 
 Half the money, half the house, half the half-and-half. 
 That's ridiculous. 
 Well, our judge doesn't think so. 
 Apparently, we got the wrong one because... he doesn't like rich people. 
 Well, clearly that's not fair. 
 Cheers. 
 I'll call Jon from the train. 
 We'll get a different judge, and even if we can't, I can't imagine it's really a problem. 
 The house is under the trust. 
 Actually, I think it is a problem. 
 Like, maybe a big problem. 
 Please. 
 One thing your father's good at is protecting his money. 
 Well, call him and tell him Gottlief wants to meet on Friday. 
 He wants to sit down with... 
 I won't do that. I can't. 
 You can't sit down with your lawyer and your business manager? 
 I can't ask your father to come on Friday. 
 Okay, fine, forget it. Go to your reunion. 
 I would if... 
 Show off your new crazy hair. 
 I don't know where he is! 
 What? 
 The last I heard, he was in Tulsa with his former student. 
 Ina. 
 [car horn honks] 
 He says he's in love. 
 [car horn honks] 
 Whitney : God, take it easy. We're coming. 
 Who has a Xanax for the Uber driver? 
 Whitney, you look very nice. 
 Are we leaving? 
 Yes, we are. 
 I thought you didn't want to go. 
 I don't. Grandma is paying me.

 Was it a complete and total nightmare? 
 Um, yeah, not my favorite. 
 How could it be? 
 Here. 
 Oh. 
 You know, no matter how much you both want out, there's still a truckload of pain in it. 
 The day of our hearing, Val and I went to the place where we met, that bar, uh, Rudy's on Ninth, and we just got absolutely shit-faced on tequila. 
 Like passing out... 
 Together? 
 Yeah, I know. Gotta be better ways. 
 Which is why I told my partners I was taking a long lunch. 
 I cleared a full 90 minutes before I have to be back, and we have an hour and ten minutes.

 They can stay with Noah. 
 In his hut? 
 No, not in his hut. 
 In an apartment. I gave him 50 grand. 
 The guy can find a two-bedroom apartment and some bunk beds. 
 You gave him 50 grand? 
 Should I not have? 
 He said he was behind on his book, he needed some money. 
 I thought, "Okay, fine." 
 Right? Because the sooner he gets his life together, the better it is for you. 
 For us. 
 Helen, you know, I was thinking about us. 
 Uh, I mean, he happens to be my friend too. 
 Yeah, I can't do this. 
 I'm sorry. I thought I could.

 Lim :  My client has always been an exemplary father,  unusually close to his children. 
 He understands that his living situation over the past two months has been difficult on the family. 
 It's been difficult for him too. 
 He's taking steps to correct it. 
 In fact, he's taken a loan and is going to look at apartments later today. 
 Two or three bedrooms in Brooklyn and should have a signed lease by August 1st at the latest. 
 A question. 
 Yes, Your Honor? 
 Does Mr. Solloway plan to live alone in this two- or three-bedroom? 
 Yes, he does. 
 That's not what we... 
 Because according to... 
 Not now, Noah. 
 What I see here, the documents in front of... 
 I told you what the plan is. Why shouldn't we just follow... 
 If Mr. Solloway has a comment, perhaps he'd like to share it with the court? 
 There is no comment, Your Honor. 
 Just tell him I want... I'll be living with her at least part of the time. 
 I'm sorry, did I just hear what I just heard? 
 Might as well just be honest. 
 Judge Polk : Mr. Solloway... 
 I don't want to be legally bound. 
 I'm going to ask you one more time, directly. 
 Will you be living by yourself in this new two- or three-bedroom? 
 Uh, well, I'll be... I'm hoping to be sharing it with my kids at least half of the time. 
 The plan was for Ms. Bailey to be there with me whenever they're not and for her to leave when they come. 
 At least at first. I'd never force her on my kids. 
 We'd take everything slowly, see how they feel, what they need... 
 Judge Polk : Okay. [sighs] 
 From everything I've heard this morning, your kids' needs, Mr. Solloway, haven't been in the forefront of your mind for at least the past year. 
 I suggest that change now, especially if you'd like to see them more than every other week. 
 Have a seat, please. 
 I'm going to issue a court order preventing Ms. Bailey from any contact with the four children until this order is lifted, and I'm also going to set a court date for eight weeks from now. 
 However... 
 I'm going to give you both a piece of advice. 
 Take a stroll through Prospect Park. 
 Walk the entire Hudson River, search your hearts, and see if you can't come up with a reasonable, grown-up agreement outside of this courtroom. 
 Because I'll tell you both, there is nothing worse for children than litigating custody. 
 [sighs] 
 Our date will be Tuesday the 18th. 
 I hope not to see you then.

 Just for now. For right now. 
 Whitney went back to Helen, and... 
 I guess she went for it. 
 I'm a liar. I screamed at her. 
 Made her leave. 
 Why am I not surprised? 
 Their lawyer's claiming she was traumatized, so the judge issued an order saying that you can't be near the kids. 
 He issued an order? 
 Can he do that? 
 Yeah... 
 It seems.

 We're fine. Thanks. 
 Do you want coffee? 
 No, we're good. Thanks. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 Stay in Cold Spring forever? 
 No, not forever. It's just... until the trial's over, till this order goes away. 
 I can see you every... 
 It's temporary, Al. 
 It's just months, and then we have our whole lives together. 
 And you going back and forth made no real sense anyway. 
 You're working there. Yvonne needs you. 
 I need you. 
 I need you. 
 Don't you get that? 
 I don't want to be alone. 
 I'm sorry, Noah, it's just... 
 You say it's only months, and it may just be months, but how long have we waited for this? 
 All that hiding and time spent apart and now we get to be together. 
 Really together. 
 I know. 
 And also, I love this apartment. I can see us there. 
 So can I. 
 So then, maybe we give Helen what she wants. 
 What? 
 Maybe the kids can come on weekends. 
 [scoffs] 
 You want me to see the kids on weekends? 
 Or more than that. I don't know. 
 Kinda sounds like you do know.

 Ex. He had an affair. [laughs]

 We found an eighth of marijuana in her purse and a vaporizer. 
 You're f*cking stoned? With the kids in the car? 
 The kids are always in my car. 
 When are they not in my car? 
 Did you see Stacey's head? 
 Sir... 
 Better not tell Judge Polk. 
 We're getting a divorce. 
 The EMTs bandaged your daughter's head. 
 Polk. Judge Polk. We're getting a divorce. 
 Polk. [laughs] Polk, Polk... 
 Helen, stop f*cking laughing. Just cut it out!

And out here on the island in Suffolk County? Forget it. Fascination with Noah Solloway... His life, his private life, his work... Has reached near epic proportions in the one month since we filed this motion. The Atticus Book Shop in Montauk, New York, has placed three reorders of the paperback version of "Descent." To think that my client could get a fair trial anywhere near this zip code is in and of itself brilliant fiction. [inhales deeply] Would the people like to respond? Only to say that there are 1.5 million potential jurors in Suffolk County. I'm pretty sure we can find 12 of them who haven't read the defendant's book. And I should probably remind the defense that our plea offer still stands. Just in case they've changed their minds. And the terms of that offer? Criminally negligent homicide with one to three years imprisonment. justice : Would the defense like to respond? Only to say, "Thank you, but no thank you." Okay, then, after reviewing the motion and hearing your very eloquent arguments, I'm going to rule with the people. The motion for change of venue is denied.
