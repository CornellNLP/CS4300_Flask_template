 Noah :  Previously on  The Affair... 
 I want to build a nightclub. 
 Come on, man. We can do this. 
 The Lockhart brothers back in business. 
 I was just wondering if you could tell me what the last day to drop this class is. 
 Tomorrow, actually, the halfway mark. 
 teacher :  If your plan is to go to med school, I really encourage you to continue. 
 The longer you wait, the harder it may be to jump back in. What are you doing? I am sending an email to my accountant and telling him to send you $50,000. Are you insane? It's not a loan. It's a gift, okay? No, I don't want to take any more money off you. Well, the sooner you and Helen get divorced... Max :  the happier everyone will be. The Lobster Roll. What about it? I want to buy it with you. I know you've got your own cash, 'cause I know what you sold your house for, okay? Is this your daughter? Yeah, uh, Gigi, I think... She's beautiful. Everybody says she looks like Alison, but to me, she looks like her daddy. You know what? She does to me too. [♪ dramatic music ♪] ♪ I was screaming into the canyon ♪

♪♪ Cole :  "I'll kill you. I will f*cking kill you." Klass : And did the defendant's threat become physical? Noah threw my brother on the ground. He started hitting him over and over again. Then he... he started choking Scotty. He couldn't breathe. If I didn't jump in, I don't know... You feared for your brother's life, didn't you? Yes. Objection. Leading. judge : Sustained. I'll refrain. Scott had impregnated Mr. Solloway's teenage daughter. In that moment, did you think that Mr. Solloway was capable of killing your brother? Gottlief : Objection! Sustained. Ms. Klass, please. No further questions. Mr. Lockhart, I only have one question for you. Do you hate Noah Solloway? Excuse me? Would you mind telling the jury what you feel when you look at the defendant? [sighs] I feel nothing. Noah Solloway had an affair with your wife, did he not? With my ex-wife. And then to add insult to injury, he destroyed your family's reputation and their livelihood in his novel. Is there no part of you that hopes that this trial will serve as an opportunity to punish him for that... Klass : Objection. Gottlief : ...and not for what he's actually accused of? Sustained. Counselor... No further questions. [♪ dramatic music ♪] ♪♪ Luisa : I'm nervous about meeting your mom later. What if she doesn't like me? She probably won't. [chuckles] I'm her kid. She can barely stand me. Well, give me some tips. How can I make a good impression? All right, here's how it's gonna go. You're gonna walk in. She's not gonna ask you to take off your shoes, but you should take off your shoes. Then she's gonna offer you some lemonade. It's gonna taste like sh1t, 'cause she never puts enough sugar into it, but try not to scrunch up your face. And then she's gonna tell you that we're cursed. So maybe don't mention the fibroids. [chuckles] Right. [cell phone ringing] f*ck. Your boss? Yeah. Stephanie? Stephanie. I-I can't... [whispering] Thank you. Hold on. I-I can't hear you. You're breaking up. We're just pulling over. Okay, now, explain to me the problem. Just have Lillian bag the meat and put it into the alley before it starts to smell. [sighs] It's in... it's in the basement. Yes, just go down there, and it's right there. It's the first one. [♪ soft music ♪] ♪♪ [sighs] ♪♪ [both sigh] 45 minutes and no calls from Stephanie. [both chuckling] Think that's got to be some kind of record. Well, one day, I'm gonna own my own restaurant so I don't have to deal with anybody else's bullshit. [sighs] What kind of place would you want to open? Nothing fancy. Someplace that means something to people that go there. I'm gonna take a bath. [sighs] [exhales] [water running] Where you going? There's no soap. Hold on, I'll get it for you. Relax. Excuse me? Uh, we don't have soap here. woman :  I'm sorry, ma'am. I thought I restocked that room. Here you go. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Mom? Cole? Hello. You're Cherry? I'm so sorry. Mom, this is my fiancée, Luisa. Very nice to meet you. Yeah, very nice to meet you too. E' I didn't know that you were working here. Well, I mean, now you know. Does the room need anything else? No, the room's fine. Okay. We'll see you later. Yes. [sighs] [knocks on door] Housekeeping. [knocks on door] Housekeeping. [knocks on door] Cherry : I haven't looked at these in years. This is on the day that we were married. Luisa : Oh, wow. You look so beautiful. Oh, thanks. Where did you find all these? I found them when I was cleaning out the breakfront right before I sold it. You sold Cora's breakfront? I didn't have a choice, Cole. [clears throat] You look just like your father, Cole. Yeah? You think? Yeah. People always tell me that, but I don't see it. Now, that crusty old son of a bitch is my grandfather Silas. Is, um, that the ranch behind you? We were married at the very top of that hill, October 2nd, 1974. I'm sorry that we didn't manage to hang on to it a little while longer for your sake, dear. What do you mean, for my sake? Oh, so that you guys could get married there too. But isn't that where you and Alison got married? Mm-hmm. Then I'm glad it's gone. Excuse me? Well, I just... I just think it's time for us to make our own traditions. We told Miranda we were gonna meet her soon, so I think we should get going, yeah? Oh. [chuckles] The prodigal son returns. Jesus Christ, Scott, you look like sh1t. You don't. Your brother hasn't been feeling very well... I feel great, Mom. Anyway, I was... I was just heading out myself. I got a busy day ahead. Where you going, baby? I'm going to meet my investor. I don't know if you heard, but the Lobster Roll is in foreclosure, and I managed to save up a little bit of money, so... You saved up some money? How'd you do that? Well, I sold my truck, sold my boat, um... Mom helped out. We sold off most of the antiques. And, you know, I just got to convince my guy that we are good to go, and tomorrow, we take the plunge. So, hey, cheers to that. Ow! f*ck me! God! God! Are you all right? Jesus Christ, I'm fine. Okay? Thanks, Mom. I'm just a little amped, okay? Yeah, I can see that. I'll get some ice. Sorry about that. How much money do you have? I got about 37K, man. 37K... What do you think that place is gonna go for, a couple million? Yeah. So you have 37 grand, and this investor's just gonna cover you for the rest. Look, man, if you want in on this, it's not too late. No, I want you to do something good with that money. I think you need to go to rehab, Scott. [scoffs] Get... get the f*ck off me. You know what? Just go f*ck yourself, okay? Who knows, maybe we'll see you in another couple years. We'll have a f*cking good time. [sighs] You gave him money? Cole, we haven't seen you in a while. You don't get to just walk on in here and tell everyone what's wrong with them. That's not what I'm doing. I'm gonna freshen up, and then we should go. Luisa :  [speaking Spanish] [laughter] [speaking Spanish] Yes, we have got to go with chocolate, right? That we can agree on. Yes, absolutely, yes. Okay, good, 'cause otherwise the wedding's off. Margaret : The wedding's off? Please tell me he's joking. [speaking Spanish] Hello, lovely. Hi, Margaret. You look beautiful. Oh, thank you. Margaret, um, this is Cole. Congratulations, Cole. Nice to meet you. Thank you. It's nice to meet you too. Adorable. And the mother. This is my mother, Cherry. Hello. [laughs] It's a pleasure. Margaret Butler. Please excuse my sweatiness. I've lost my mind and started spinning. [chuckles] Come on, everybody, sit down. Mi casa es su casa, as Miranda would say. Well, have you picked a weekend? I want to tell the landscaper so he can put some plants out. Uh... Margaret : Haven't you asked them? Asked them what? [speaking Spanish] I'm sorry, what'd she say? I would love to have the wedding here. I'll pay for everything. Luisa : That's... I don't think... It's the least I can do. Your mother has taken care of this house and us for 30 years, and now the place is basically empty. I know, that's very generous, but... Miranda :  [speaking Spanish] both :  [speaking Spanish] I think there may have just been a misunderstanding here. I'm sorry. I don't want to upset anyone. It's just an offer, sweetheart. I know. You can take it or leave it. Right, and we really appreciate it. Luisa : Yes, we do. But this is a Lockhart-Leon wedding, and we'd like to do it ourselves. Did you say Lockhart? As in the Lockhart Ranch, the brothers? That's right. I trust you're not the one who impregnated my granddaughter. Oh, my God. That's my brother, Scott. I see. So you must be the one who pulled a gun on Noah Solloway. Should we go? Yeah. [speaks Spanish] Cole : Miranda, pleasure. We'll see you soon. Hasta luego. Miranda : You're leaving? Cherry : It was wonderful to meet you. Hold on. I understand you might not want to have the wedding here, but please know that you're welcome to. That's very generous of you. Thank you. I've come to a time in my life when I understand that... a little forgiveness goes a long way. We could just elope. I don't want to elope. It could be nice, a quick little road trip out to Vegas... Vegas? No! We could hitch the trailer up to the back of my car. That's great. Any other ideas? I do have one other idea. What about the Lobster Roll? For our wedding? Yeah. Didn't you see it this morning? It's, like, falling down. It's in foreclosure. What if we bought it? What if we fixed it up? Are you serious? Yeah, yeah, I think I am. I mean, look, Scotty is in a very dark place, but he's right about this. It's a f*cking great investment. You can't get into or out of Montauk without driving right past that place. I know that, but... I mean, just think about it. New menu, new space, keep what's always made that place great, but make it your own, make it our own. Cole... It's tempting, right? We have our own place. We can move back out here. We can work for ourselves. No more crazy Stephanie. [chuckles] Yeah, but we'll have crazy Scotty instead. Well, I don't think we could do it with him. No? No. Not in the condition that he's in. And he's completely full of sh1t. He has nowhere near that kind of money. And we do? Well, yeah, kind of. What do you mean? My money from Alison's house. But I thought you didn't want to touch that money. I don't, but I would for this. Is it enough? Um, I think it's, like, half enough. Cole, I don't want to get a loan from the bank. I promised myself, I didn't want to get in debt in this country. I don't want to get a loan either. Okay, so how's it gonna work? Do you know people with lots of money? I thought we could ask Alison. [scoffs] Look, I'm pretty sure she still has her share of the money, and I bet that she'd be willing to go in on this with us. To buy the restaurant? You, me, and your ex? [laughs] Yes. Alison cheated on you, Cole. I know. Look, I'll admit I haven't worked through all the details yet, and I know that sounds crazy, but... but I mean... I'd rather go to Vegas. If what's holding you back from this is the fear that it might lead to me getting back together with my ex-wife, who cheated on me, that's not ever going to happen. You have my word. What if I say no? What do you mean? Is the wedding gonna be off? No. Of course not. If you say no, that's the end of it. I will do whatever you want. We can get married wherever you want, and we can live wherever you want. This could be a dream come true or the worst idea ever. I can't decide. man :  A 1.3 million. I have 1.3 million. 1.4 million, 1.4 million? 1.4 million is bid. Do I have 1.5 million? [gavel bangs] [♪ soft music ♪] ♪♪ Can I give you a ride to the train station? Uh... no. I'm gonna go swing by and take a look at our new... Holy f*ck! You are my hero. What are you doing? And you, you m*therf*cker! God damn it! Oh, God, I was gonna stay away. I was... especially after my guy stood me up yesterday, I was definitely gonna stay away, but I guess I'm a f*cking masochist, huh? So I just... I had to see what Manhattan douche bag was gonna steal my dream, and goddamn if it wasn't you. Oh, God! I was watching you from the back. You were raising your hand like a motherfucking baller. And, Jesus, man, you came through. You always do. You always come through. Alison : Are you feeling okay, Scotty? Oh, yeah, I'm f*cking happy. I'm just happy. God, you're not gonna regret this, okay? You are not gonna regret this. What's that? About 37 grand, give or take. Like, I don't know what the percentages work out to, but... I don't want your money. I don't want it. What do you mean, you don't want it? Here, take it, take it, please. I don't want it. No, come on... I'm not going into business with you like this, okay? I'm not looking for an even split or anything. The answer's no! Scott, the answer's no. No, uh-uh. Now wait a second, okay? 'Cause this was my idea. I told you about this. I told you  both  about this. Take that money and do something useful with it, okay? You can't do this to me, Cole. You... you cannot do this to me. Everything I've wanted in my life,  you  take away from me. Huh? First it was Luisa; now it's the f*cking Lobster Roll. This was my idea! This was my shot! Scotty, you're a f*cking junkie! All right, I'm the junkie! I'm the fuckup! I'm the loser. But her, her... her, you trust? You are so f*cking blind. You can't see what is right in front of you! She's f*cking pathological! God damn it, Cole, I could tell you something that would blow up your entire f*cking life. Couldn't I? f*ck you, Scott. Huh? Couldn't I? But what you're gonna do is, you're f*cking going to cut me in! [bottle shatters] [sobbing] Scott, hey, hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Scotty. I'm sorry. You all right? Hey, bud, hey. It's gonna be okay, all right? Just take it, please. Just f*cking take it. All right. Hey, hey, man. Scott, Scott, I'll bring you in, okay? I will bring you in. I promise. You just got to go someplace that's gonna give you some help. Okay? I will drive you there myself. Just please promise me you will do that. You have got to clean up. If I go... [sniffles] If I go, you... you bring me in? Yeah. I promise, okay? But you got to get cleaned up, okay? No more of this. [crying] [♪ soft music ♪] ♪♪ Hey, what were you gonna tell me? What was it that you were gonna tell me that could f*ck up my entire life? [♪ soft music ♪] ♪♪ [cell phone alarm ringing] [groans] [♪ soft music ♪] [groans] Oh, God. [♪ soft music ♪] ♪♪ [typing] [♪ soft music ♪] ♪♪ [knock at door] Knock knock. What time is it? It's time for me to shower. Who's awake? Uh, everybody. I put on some more coffee for you. Thanks. Noah? Noah? Noah! I called you, like, three times. Sorry, didn't hear. Look, uh, do you have any time to talk this morning? Uh, well, not really. I really want to finish this section before I see Harry today. Maybe when the kids leave for school? I just need some time with you. How about tonight? Let's have a date night. It'll be nice. Trevor :  Dad, Joanie spilled my juice! Okay, we'll do it tonight, yeah? Trevor :  Ow! Dad! Dad, Stacey hit me! Hey, it's your final today, isn't it? Yeah. Don't be nervous. You'll be great. Trevor :  Dad! Coming. So when do you think I might be able to see some pages? I don't know, Harry. I've still got a ton of research. Well, I would love to get something in the stores by Christmas. Are you out of your mind? Oh, okay, how about Valentine's Day? It's not that kind of book. But there is a certain optimal window of time for follow-up, okay? If we get your second book in the stores this year, that would be ideal. Are you sleeping at all? Let me just... let me tell you a little about my schedule right now, okay? I've got 15 needy students whose finals have to be evaluated by next week. My baby's still not sleeping through the night. Alison is studying for her MCATs. My other four children, one of whom is still not speaking to me, so I spend about an hour every day writing letters of apology to her, which she never returns. I get up at 4:30 in the morning to write on the toilet because Alison has turned my office into a f*cking nursery. Okay, okay, I hear you, man. You know, we need to get you out of town. You know what, I got a friend on the board of Yaddo. I will call her today. We can have you up there by the end of this week. You can stay there as long as you like. As long as it takes. I can't go to Yaddo. What about Yvonne? I'm sure she would love to have you back in Cold Spring. Didn't you hear anything I just said about Alison and the kids? Surely, Helen can take the older ones for a little while. Alison can handle Joanie. Why wouldn't that work? Because I can't. I can't do that to her. These tests are really important. If she doesn't ace them, she's not going to school anywhere, least of all the city. Okay. I didn't realize that Alison wanted to be a doctor. Yeah, it's her lifelong dream. That's surprising, for some reason. Why? I don't know. I guess it shouldn't. Some people just write slowly, Harry. Do you know how long it took Charles Frasier to write  Cold Mountain? Ten years. Right, ten years. And that was a good book. Right, then took him another ten years to write the second book. He wrote another one? Exactly. People have a very short memory, Noah, and I just want to keep you relevant for a little while longer. You know what, I got an idea. Since you don't have as much time now as you would like, why don't you put the Omar Bradley idea aside for a little while and concentrate on something less ambitious? Like what? Like  Ascent. Ascent? It's a sequel. No. I don't think people are done with Daniel Tapper's journey. What happens to him after he kills Lana? Is he punished for the crime? Does he get away with it? You wrote  Descent  in under three months, right? So you knock another one out in the series... Series? Yes, and we keep your name on the best seller list, and we buy you some time to write your opus when you're ready. What kind of writer do you think I am, Harry? An excellent one. Like Danielle Steel? How about John Le Carré? No,  Descent...  it was an anomaly. I mean, it poured out of me because it had to. But I'm not... I'm not a pulp novelist. [sighs] This is not my first rodeo, Noah. I have seen writers do exactly what you're doing, right? They write one smashing success, and then they get scared that they're gonna be ghettoized as populists, so they take a decade to write the second book, and by that time, nobody remembers who they are or why we cared. Just consider the possibility that maybe you wrote  Descent  so quickly and so brilliantly because that actually is the writer that you are. And this attempt to follow Omar Bradley to Paris is perhaps your ego speaking... and not your heart. How was everything? It was great. Can I get you two anything else? No, I'm done. 
 
 [indistinct chatter] Excuse me. Are you coming out of the biochemistry final? Yeah, man. I got killed. Sorry to hear that. Which classroom is it? That one, through those doors. Thanks. Can I help you? Yeah, is this biochem? Was. Torture's over. I'm looking for Alison Bailey. She's a student. Yeah, I know Alison, my runaway nurse. Runaway? Alison dropped six, seven weeks ago, before the midterm. Sorry, that's impossible. She was headed to class this morning. Fun starts again in September. Tell her, uh, she's welcome back. Have a good summer, man. [♪ dramatic music ♪] Ali? ♪♪ [line trilling] Alison? Hi, Dad! Hey. Hi, Daddy. Hey. Have you seen Alison? No, I was here alone with Joanie this morning. Then I left to get the kids. Something wrong? You heard from her? Nothing at all. [cell phone chimes] [♪ dramatic music ♪] ♪♪ What the f*ck? [♪ dramatic music ♪] ♪♪ Hey, man, don't kill the messenger. Where is she? Right now, no idea. Where did you take that picture? Town hall this morning. Auction for the Roll. The... the... Yeah, the Lobster Roll. Which I lost today to Cole and Alison. What? Yeah. Funny, I had a feeling she hadn't told you. I have a sixth sense about that girl. I always have. You're telling me that Cole and Alison... Placed a bid, bought the Roll right out from f*cking under me. f*cking hurricane puts me at least 100 Gs in the hole. Then I had to get a second mortgage to cover my... My father's heart surgery. But do they f*cking care? No, of course not. I mean, why should they? It's not like we've known each other for 30 years. Okay. Here's my question for you. Reason I got in touch. Whose money did she use to make that down payment? 'Cause if it's yours, you can just call the bank and void the check, right? No, we don't have a joint account. If she wrote a check, it's her money. What kind of married people don't share a f*cking bank account? We're not married. I thought you had a kid together. We do. Oh. bartender : Another? Yeah, another, both of us. Come on. Thank you. I don't understand why she'd do something like that without telling me. Really? Really? You don't? After all this time, do you still not know her? You know what you are, Solloway? You're a tourist. You're just a f*cking tourist. You drive through this place. You think it's so charming. You fall in love it it, and you want a piece of it. You think, "Oh, she's so beautiful. She's so sad, though. I can save her. I can take away her pain. I can make her see that life's worth living again." Wait, I get you. I get you, man. I was standing just where you stood once. Of course, I was only 18 and she didn't even have that child yet. But I got a little secret for you. That whole wounded bird thing? It's an act. Wasn't Gabriel's death that broke her heart. She never f*cking had one. [♪ dramatic music ♪] ♪♪ How the f*ck did you find the place? You sent me a link when you bought it. It's still in my phone. Come on up. Wow. This is spectacular, Max. Thanks, buddy. I appreciate it. So what brings you out here in the middle of the week? Where are all those children? Uh, they're with Helen. Joanie's with the nanny. I'm looking for Alison. Looking for her? What do you mean? I've lost her. She's gone. What? Yeah, evidently she, uh... she's bought the Lobster Roll. She bought the Lobster Roll? With her ex-husband. With her... wait, what? Yeah. Now she's not answering her phone. Wow, that's, um... wow. Is that all you have to say? Give me a second here, Solloway. I'm, uh... processing. Do you think maybe she's... she's an evil person or something? What? No. Why would you say that? Because I can't understand how anyone could behave like this. Noah, you've... have you ever been left before? Have you ever been dumped? No. I have. Many times, and I can tell you from personal experience that people leave for lots of different reasons. It's not... it's not just because they're bad and you're good or you're bad and they're good. Sometimes people are just going through something and you can't be a part of it. Max, no offense, I'm not here for your general theory about love. Well, what are you doing here? I don't know. Noah... can I say something you might not want to hear? When we were younger, you'd wash up on my front door. I would've just seen you the night before or something. Your troubles, they were just a part of the... scrum of our lives. We had everything in between... school, career, friends. I'd see you, what, three times a week? But now, Noah, I got to be honest, um, it feels like it's only the washing-up part, like there is no in-between. Okay, do you want me to leave? No, I don't. I want you to unload whatever you got on your chest, and then I want you to f*cking call me in a couple days and invite me to dinner, ask me how I am. I'm sorry, Max. I guess I was embarrassed. Last time I saw you was... That party was a low point, yeah. I should've called you. I'm sorry I'm a dick. How are you? I'm good. Yeah, hey, thanks for asking. Been spending a lot of time out here just... being alone, man. It's really sort of revelatory. Yeah? Yeah. I wouldn't know. So... Alison. Tell me. So all this time, I thought she was getting her post-bac so she could go to medical school, and I was paying for it because I thought it might make her happy, and it turns out it's all bullshit. She quit her course six weeks ago. What has she been doing since then? I have no f*cking idea. What are you gonna do now? What, you mean when she finally makes it home? If she makes it home? I don't know. I can't... I can't trust her. How do you have a relationship with someone you can't trust? Well, I mean, it can't come as a total surprise, right? I mean, the relationship did start as an affair. So? So I'm just saying maybe we could've seen this coming. We have a child together. I know. I know. You could always go back to Helen. She still loves you. I'm certain of that. No, she doesn't. She has a new boyfriend. She's bananas about him. Who is he? He's the doctor who operated on Martin. You're kidding me. I wish I was. What's he like? I don't know. I'm not f*cking him. What do you think she sees in him? Besides the fact he's a perfect-looking surgeon? I mean... do you think she's in love? Why do you care, Max? Why do you care, Max? [♪ dramatic music ♪] ♪♪ [scoffs] Did you... did you f*ck my wife? Your ex-wife. Did you f*ck my f*cking wife? [glass shatters] [♪ dramatic music ♪] ♪♪ It's Waterford Crystal, no big deal. I love her, Noah. I always have. I know I shouldn't have done it, but I thought, when you left, I thought maybe this was what was supposed to happen all along. Maybe... all these years of being your third wheel were leading to this, to my chance. What? What? What, so this... our whole friendship has been about some kind of competition with you playing the long game? No. What, waiting in the wings till I show a moment of weakness? A moment of weakness? Come in and steal my f*cking wife? She's not your wife! You left. Twice. She took you back. You did it again. You didn't want to f*cking be there, Noah. And you would tell anyone who would f*cking listen. She knew it. I knew it. Hell, your kids probably knew it, but you had no appreciation for what you had. All you wanted, all you've ever wanted is more. I wanted her. That's it. That's all I ever wanted. So when you kicked her to the curb like a piece of trash, I thought this was my chance to make her happy because I knew that I could devote my whole self to her in a way that you never would. But she didn't want me, man. She still wanted you. After everything you put her through, I mean, what is it? I don't understand. I fought so hard my whole life for everyone who's ever loved me, fought for every bit of intimacy. My wife barely tolerated me. My children still don't speak to me. But you, man, you... everybody just lets you go, no matter how hard you try to blow it up. I don't get it. What do you have that I don't? I'm sorry about the glass. Don't leave like that, man. Don't leave like this. Just say something. What do you want me to say? Say that you understand. Well, I don't. Sorry. You say you're my friend, but you're just jealous of me. That's not friendship, Max. Of course it is. What are you f*cking talking about? How many times have I bailed your ass out over the years, given you a place to crash? How much money have I lent you? I did that because I love you. Max... your problem is, you think you can buy people. You think people have a price. And you can tell yourself any story you want, but you paid me $50,000 so you could f*ck my wife. That's what happened. The reason nobody loves you, Max, is because without your money, you're... you're invisible. You're f*cking nothing. [♪ suspenseful music ♪] ♪♪ [cell phone rings] [tires screeching] [ringing continues] [thunder] First of all, I'm sorry, but please don't be mad. I'm not mad. I mean, I was mad about six hours ago. Now I'm just really tired. So what's going on, Alison? I bought this place. I heard. With Cole. Who told you? Look, anyway, I've decided this is what I want to do with the money from the house. Okay. And I couldn't afford it on my own, so Cole and I decided to go in together as business partners. Business partners? Yes. And you thought it was totally okay to make such a life-changing decision without even asking me? Now I see why your first marriage fell apart. Look, I tried talking to you this morning about it, but you seemed so distracted, and... Are you serious? You mean while you were in the shower? Look, it happened really quickly. Cole called me up last night, and there just wasn't time to have a conversation about it. I had to decide quickly. Alison, I've been trying really, really hard this year to understand you, to understand... you're from a different world. You're... you've been through different experiences. You're different, and I need to accept that, but this isn't gonna work if you can't communicate or compromise. You can't just do anything you want without even at least talking to me. I was afraid you'd say no. Well, I probably would have. Most men would think that you going into business with your ex-husband, who, if you remember correctly, wants to kill me, is not a good f*cking idea. I'm sorry, but this is what I want to do. [sighs] When were you gonna tell me about dropping out of school? Now? I'm sorry. I guess I was embarrassed because I couldn't handle it. It was too hard. Look, look, this could be good for us. For us? Yes. It's a good investment... a great one, actually. This restaurant is right at the entrance to town. Every summer, they mint money here. I could keep us going off the profits. You wouldn't have to teach anymore. You could take as long as you wanted to write your next book. No, no, no. Why not? Because... Do you love me? Of course I do. Then don't do this. For me. I really don't want you to do it, okay? I'll figure out something for us. I'll... things are okay at the moment. I'll write another book, quickly, if I need to, but just not this. It's already done. Back out. I... [♪ soft music ♪] ♪♪ Are you f*cking him again? [scoffs] I knew you'd ask that. Well, are you? No. No, I'm not. Do you believe me? You have to trust me, Noah. I want to do this for myself. I don't want to be a doctor. No? You don't? 'Cause you told me that... I know, but it wasn't right. It's not for me. Look, you're so lucky. You know exactly what you want to do with your life. I don't. I just know I want to do something. I don't just want to be your wife or Joanie's mother. I know, that's why we decided you'd go back to school. I spent the last six weeks walking around the city. I've crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, like, 50 times trying to find an insight into myself, trying to... Okay, okay. So what did you figure out? Just that I miss home. Look, this is who I am, Noah. I don't belong at those fancy book parties. I'm just a girl from Montauk. This is my home. This is where I belong. So I mean, how does this work? You gonna move back out here? I don't know. You taking Joanie with you? I thought maybe we could split our time. What about my other kids? I mean, they're gonna split their time? They're in school. I don't know, Noah. I don't know how it's all gonna work out. I just... [sighs] I just hoped we could figure it out together. Can we, please? [♪ dramatic music ♪] Klass :  May we approach, Your Honor? Judge : You may. Your Honor, I have a motion to amend my witness list. I'm sorry, we've been in preparation for months, and you're just coming forward with this now? Witness just contacted the DA's office last evening with information about the defendant's car. Is this witness a car mechanic? You wish he were, Jon. Here's a summation of his statement. [♪ dramatic music ♪] ♪♪ Klass : And what time was it? Max : About 10:30 p.m. I'd been feeling under the weather, decided to turn in early. I got into bed, and that's when I heard something. What did you hear? I heard a car. And then the god-awful motion-sensitive lights went on in the drive, so I got up, went to the window. And whose car was it? Noah Solloway. [crowd murmuring] Did he call or ring the bell? No, the house lights were out. My car was in the shop. It's my vacation residence, so I think he assumed I wasn't home. Objection. Conjecture. Stay with what you witnessed. I got up, threw on some jeans. I thought he was maybe there for a drink, but that wasn't the case. Then I heard the hose in the front go on, so I went back to the windows. And what did you see? Noah hosing off the front of his car. Klass : Are you sure it was Mr. Solloway? Yeah, I'm sure. The floodlights were pretty bright, and we've been friends for almost 30 years. It was him. And then what happened? Nothing, he finished what he was doing, got back into his car, and he drove away. After he was gone, did you investigate the driveway? I did. Klass : What did you find? I found blood. [crowd murmuring] [gavel banging] Klass : No further questions. Judge : Order! Quiet in the court! [♪ dramatic music ♪] ♪♪ [♪ dramatic music ♪] ♪♪
