 Previously on  The Affair... 
 Mom got another call from her realtor. 
 So? 
 It was a very high offer. 
 We're not selling the ranch. 
 The ranch has been in the family for seven generations. 
 So Oscar had a relationship with the victim. 
 They were friends. 
 Do you remember being worried at the time? 
 No, but I should've been. 
 Ran into Oscar waiting for the mechanic. 
 I keep telling the town they got to do something about those potholes out in Ditch Plains. 
 Ditch Plains? 
 Thanks for stopping by, man. 
 Hey, I was just... All right, man, come on! 
 Hey! 
 Whoa! 
 Just leave now, please. 
 I thought we were friends, man. 
 What were you doing in Ditch Plains this morning? 
 I was wondering if you still need a hand. _ 
 Why don't you spend a couple more hours here with us today? 
 If it's all right with your folks. 
 Yeah, great, thanks. 
 All right, first lesson... Take those into the barn. 
 Want some company? 
 Not really. 
 I'm gonna go find a pool boy that lets me shower with him. 
 Mr. Solloway, do you know a place called the end? 
 No, what is it? 
 So you've never been? 
 Never.

 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Okay, I'll get another one. 
 Sam, over here! 
 Hello, handsome. 
 Hey, Max. 
 What's up, man? 
 Yeah. 
 Come on, I got a table. 
 Yeah, good, good. 
 Just hop in for one second. 
 One second. 
 What? 
 Just real quick, real quick. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'll tell you, I'll tell you. 
 Just one second. 
 Hey, just, uh... let's pull down here. 
 Hey, Noah, can you spot me $40? 
 I'm short. 
 Sure. 
 Thanks. 
 Here you go. 
 Seriously? 
 [Sniffing] 
 Not in here, bro. 
 Just got to try it. 
 All right. You? 
 No, thanks. 
 Let's go. 
 [Sniffing] Come on, man. 
 Thanks. 
 Remind me to thank your wife for this, will you? 
 Why? 
 Because it's lovely. 
 And it was kind of her to let you come out and play. 
 She doesn't keep me in a cage, Max. 
 I occasionally get to make my own decisions sometimes, you know? 
 Besides, I haven't been out. I've been writing. 
 Writing? Yeah, how's the book coming? 
 Great. 
 Good. 
 It's pouring out of me, actually. 
 For once, I feel like I'm in touch with something real. 
 You don't care. 
 No, I don't care. 
 You didn't even read my first book. 
 Hey, listen, I love you, and I read the dedication. 
 What? To Helen? 
 To Helen. Helen Butler. 
 Good God. 
 College was a long f*cking time ago, huh? 
 25 years. 
 Don't say that out loud. 
 How did you ever bag that beautiful piece of princess? 
 Bigger mystery's how you managed to bag Val. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Sorry, man. 
 Nah. 
 How you doing without her? 
 Let me tell you something, Solloway, my separation from Val is possibly the greatest thing that's ever happened to me... 
 Well, you know, besides my kids... 
 Probably. 
 Um, hey, guys. 
 Do you mind if I sit here? 
 Sure. 
 Not at all. 
 I'm meeting friends here, but they haven't shown up yet. 
 Well, listen, we'll be your friends. 
 I'm Max. 
 Hi, Max. 
 Hi. This is Noah. 
 Hi. 
 Well, it's nice to meet you both. 
 I'm Alison. 
 Well, Alison, you probably noticed my friend here is slightly more handsome than I am, but I am considerably less married. 
 I may have noticed that. 
 Oh, hey, can I get some champagne, please? 
 When I give the sign, fall back. 
 You got Moet? Thank you. 
 You're hilarious. 
 Just believe me... this is not working. 
 Stop. 
 Let me use your phone for a minute. 
 Give it to me. These texts are great. 
 No way. I got to go home. 
 You don't have to go home. 
 I do have to go home. 
 Hey, I'm gonna go to this party. 
 Just come with me. 
 No. 
 Hey! 
 I love you, I love you. 
 Look, guess what. 
 I'm gonna go get that girl. 
 What girl? 
 The girl with that dress. 
 She's gone. 
 No, she's not. 
 She's gone. 
 How do you know she's gone? 
 When did you see her last? 
 Noah, you're being ridiculous. 
 Okay, you know what? Let's go. 
 Hey, hey! No, no. 
 I love you. Go home, go home. 
 b*st*rd. I love you too. 
 I'll call you... in, like, a year. 
 Careful now. 
 Yes. 
 Yes?

 You know, sometimes I worry you're just a really great dream. 
 Well, don't wake up now. 
 So I was thinking about next week. 
 Next week, I'm gonna have to go back to the city. 
 I don't want to talk about next week. 
 Maybe... 
 Once everything's settled down back home, I could take some time off and apply for a couple of artist residencies... 
 You know, the places where they give you a cabin for a little while, and I could come out here for a few weeks, maybe a month... 
 Finish my novel, be with you every night. 
 So I'd be your mistress. 
 I hate that word. 
 Well, what would you prefer? 
 Concubine. 
 Concubine. 
 Wait a second. Are you leaving already? 
 [Sighs] Cole's getting back this morning. 
 I told you that. 
 Oh, I must've missed that somehow. 
 You and he still... 
 What? 
 Nothing. Never mind. 
 Behaving like married people? 
 Forget it. 
 It's none of my business. 
 Where's your dress? 
 In my bag. 
 You brought a change of clothes? 
 Of course I did. 
 I can't go home smelling like you. 
 Well, that's what the shower was for. 
 Well, you should change, too, before you go home. 
 And f*ck my wife. 
 Sorry. 
 At least let me drive you. 
 All those drunks still on the road... 
 Find me later. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Where the hell is she going? 
 Hey. 
 [Tires screech] 
 What the hell, man? 
 How's Max? 
 What? 
 Your best friend... how is he? 
 Oh, yeah, he's, um... 
 He's, uh... 
 Max is... 
 Max is a disaster. 
 Hmm. 
 Noah. 
 Noah, honey. 
 Oh, Jesus Christ, Helen. What? 
 Noah, wake up. Come on. 
 What? 
 We can't find Martin. 
 Great. 
 No, just tell him his mother would prefer it if he left a note next time. 
 Yeah. You too. 
 He is at the ranch. 
 Biked over there early. 
 Mystery solved. 
 So he just went by himself? 
 I didn't take him. 
 Well, what was he thinking? 
 He's 14, Helen. He probably wasn't. 
 Daughter... 
 Question... 
 If you wanted to get some cocaine around here, how would you do it? 
 What? I don't do coke. 
 Why are you even asking? 
 It's for my book. 
 I need to know how someone in Montauk would score some drugs. 
 [Laughs] 
 "Score some drugs." Wow. 
 Come on, help me out. 
 You must hear things. 
 I have not and never will have cause to answer that question, Dad. 
 I'm taking the kids to lunch. 
 I was checking to see if you wanted to come. 
 Where you going? 
 I don't know. Lobster Roll probably. 
 Um, no, thanks. 
 I'm gonna work. 
 Okay. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Whitney wants her phone back. 
 No. 
 Her therapist says it's okay. 
 Then definitely not. 
 She wants us to go in there with her. 
 Where, to therapy? 
 Do we have to? 
 I don't think it's such a bad idea for us. 
 "For us"? 
 Yeah, you've been kind of distant lately. 
 I'm sorry, Helen. It's just... it's just this book. 
 And you don't want to f*ck me anymore. 
 Of course I do. 
 Is that what this is about? 
 Come here. Come here. 
 I feel old. 
 Do I look old? 
 No, you look incredible. 
 I look old. 
 I'm still a great lay, right? 
 Are you kidding? 
 You're the best lay. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sniffles] So why aren't we having s*x? 
 Because we... we got four kids. 
 We're... we're staying with your parents. 
 Let's do it tonight. 
 Tonight? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll have my parents take the kids out to dinner, and we can stay home, okay? 
 I'd love that. 
 Deal? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna buy a candle. 
 Okay, but not sage. 
 I like sage. 
 I know you like sage, but you're allergic. 
 Just a little bit. 
 Yeah, then you should color your lobster blue. 
 They aren't blue. They're red! 
 Mom, tell him he's wrong! 
 I'm not wrong. I'm more advanced! 
 Hey, guys, stop. 
 You keep fighting, I'll take away the crayons. 
 Hey, Solloways. 
 Both : Uncle Max! 
 I didn't know you invited Max. 
 Yeah, is that a problem? 
 No. 
 Helen the felon. 
 Hello. 
 Come here. 
 Mom, dad is right there. 
 Whitney, come on. 
 Sorry. 
 You missed a hell of a party last night, by the way. 
 Yes, I heard. 
 Noah didn't get home until after 5:00. 
 5:00? Damn, Solloway. 
 Keeping the party up without me? 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 Welcome back, my favorite family. 
 Can I get you guys something to drink? 
 Yes, I don't know about these little hooligans, but me and that old man are gonna have a couple Bloody Marys, please. 
 No, no, I can't. 
 No, go ahead, do it. 
 I'll drive. 
 May I have a bloody Mary? 
 When I'm dead. 
 I want to drink blood. 
 Blah! 
 Stop. Leave her alone. 
 Isn't that what's-her-name from last night? 
 She was all over me. What is her name, again? 
 Alison. 
 I'm good with names. 
 Hmm. 
 You know what? 
 I think I'm gonna ask madam Alison on a  rendezvous avec moi. 
 Oh, come on, Max, you can do better than that. 
 Hey, Helen, I'm not trying to drive her off the lot. 
 I'm just hoping for a little spin around the neighborhood. 
 She's taken. 
 What? 
 She's married, you idiot. 
 She is? 
 She told me last night. 
 Huh. 
 She wasn't acting very married. 
 Maybe she's in an open relationship. 
 Whitney. 
 What? 
 Grandma said when she was young and grandpa was in Vietnam... 
 Whitney, shh! Stop talking right now. 
 Mommy, I need to go to the bathroom. 
 Why don't you let daddy take you? 
 Daddy? 
 Sure, come on. 
 I'm gonna go too. 
 Lock the door, okay? 
 [Knock at door] 
 Done already? 
 Shh. 
 [Mouthing words] 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Knock at door] 
 Daddy, I'm done. 
 Hey, you ready to go back? 
 Let's go, come on. 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I... 
 [Crying] 
 God, I... 
 I started talking about Val and the boys and just, um... 
 Turned into sad Max, huh? 
 It's okay. 
 No, it's not. 
 It's okay. 
 Thanks, angel. Thank you. 
 You know, kids, um, your parents have been keeping a very big secret from you. 
 What kind of secret? 
 Is it okay if I tell 'em? 
 Your parents are, uh... 
 Your parents are aliens. 
 Really? 
 They are? 
 I'm sorry to tell you that, but they're aliens, and they come from a planet on the edge of the universe, where the sky is green and, um... 
 [Laughs] 
 Marriages work. 
 Thanks. Lunch was great. 
 I'm glad it was up to your standards. 
 Listen, man, I'm sorry about what happened to the Butlers. 
 You just caught us at a lousy time, you know? 
 Max wants to take us all mini-golfing. 
 What, now? 
 Why not? 
 Well, I wanted to do some work this afternoon. 
 Yeah, I figured. 
 I told him you wouldn't be interested, so we're gonna take the minivan, and you can take his car. 
 Okay, if that's what you want to do. 
 Mm-hmm. See you later. 
 Hey, man, what are you doing right now? 
 You want to get that drink? 
 I'd still like to pick your brains about the town, hear some stories. 
 All right, sure. 
 She's cute, isn't she? 
 Oh, um- 
 I used to bang her. 
 Yeah? 
 It's true, back in high school... 
 Popped her cherry. 
 [Sighs] So tell me about this book you're writing. 
 Um... It's a romance of sorts. 
 Romance? Not my genre of choice, but okay. 
 Well, it's a crime story too. 
 Now we're talking. So who's screwing who? 
 Well, the guy is a... He's a broker from the city, and the woman is a... 
 Oh, f*ck me. 
 Hey, Oscar, Mr. Solloway. 
 What a surprise. I didn't know you two were pals. 
 Oscar's helping me with a book I'm writing. 
 You sure do have a knack for making new friends. 
 Hey, do you mind if we talk for a minute? 
 I would love to, but as you can see, I'm already engaged in a conversation. 
 You owe me money, Hodges. 
 Yeah. 
 You owe me a permit, asshole. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Scotty. 
 What the f*ck are you doing, man? 
 Excuse me. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Excuse me, Dora. 
 Go, go! 
 Yeah, I'd like to report some suspicious activity. 
 Blue Water Taxi dispatch. 
 Yeah. No, just, uh, there's some shady characters heading over there from the fishing docks at some strange hours. 
 Yeah, drugs most likely coming off the fishing boats. 
 Yeah, that's exactly what I'm thinking. 
 It's a plague on our community, sir. 
 Bye. 
 Another round? 
 No, thank you. 
 You sure? 
 What was all that about? 
 f*cking dealers, man. 
 Who? 
 The Lockharts. 
 They own that ranch out towards the lighthouse. 
 It's a front. 
 They're as dirty as dirt. 
 Their great-grandfather ran a bootleg operation. 
 It's f*cking hereditary. 
 Put that in your book. 
 Use their names. 
 Hey. 
 Can I speak to you for a second? 
 Yeah. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Anyone could see us. 
 Who are you? 
 What? 
 You been dealing drugs? 
 Excuse me? 
 I saw you bike to the docks this morning. 
 I saw you pick up the cooler and drop it off at the taxi. 
 What, you were following me? 
 You need to go. 
 Just tell me it's not true. 
 Just tell me I'm crazy, and I'll leave. 
 I'll pretend we never had this conversation. 
 You're crazy. 
 Oscar called the police. 
 How do you know? 
 Because I was there. 
 I saw him do it. 
 What'd he say? 
 Oh, what does it matter... 
 Tell me what he said. 
 You're a drug dealer? 
 I hate that word. 
 I trusted you. 
 I put my whole life into your hands. 
 Noah, you're tired. 
 Go home. 
 I'll call you later. 
 Cole! 
 Yeah? 
 Oscar told the police. We have to go now. 
 Right now! 
 Got it! 
 Hey, we got to go! 
 Oscar narked us out. 
 I'll meet you back here, okay? 
 Back here. 
 Dad? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Get a lot of writing done today? 
 Come here. Come here. 
 What's wrong? 
 Come here. 
 What's the matter? What? 
 What are you doing? Everybody's home. 
 f*ck that. Let them hear it. 
 Oh, God, you smell so good. 
 I missed you. 
 I missed you. 
 I really missed you. 
 I really missed you. 
 [Both moan] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Urine splashing] 
 Really? 
 Too soon? 
 Noah? 
 Gotcha! 
 Ah! 
 [Both laugh] 
 Gotcha. 
 Were you worried? 
 No. 
 Did I scare you? 
 Oh, sh1t, I have to go. 
 What, you got somewhere to be at 10 to 5:00? 
 Yeah. 
 Will? 
 Hey. Where's Will? 
 Hey. 
 Who's that? 
 Caleb, who is that? 
 No idea. 
 Really? 
 Victoria, maybe? Vanessa? 
 You f*cked her? 
 Of course not, no. 
 I'm married. 
 Relax, relax, relax. She's comatose. 
 You know, uh, Will wasn't there this morning. 
 What do you mean? 
 On the boat. 
 There was someone new. 
 It's Will's boat. 
 I know, but I'm telling you, he wasn't on it. 
 Oh. That's weird. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 [Horse neighs] 
 What's her name? 
 Elizabeth Taylor. 
 Oh, yeah, I see the resemblance. 
 You know, I've been married long enough to know it's not the greatest idea in the world to compare your wife to a horse, but she does remind me of you. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 She's majestic, she's stubborn, and she likes apples. 
 [Clicking tongue] Come on. 
 Come on, let's show the lady to her room. 
 Ready for occupancy, my lady. 
 [Horse neighs] 
 Martin. 
 Martin. 
 Ah, sh1t. 
 I just wanted to help with the new horse, I swear. 
 Please don't tell my parents. 
 Martin, I got to ask you something, and it's important, so I need you to be straight with me. 
 Have you had breakfast yet? 
 You want some eggs? 
 Yes, please. 
 Better eat up... we're gonna put you to work today. 
 You can take my work, little man. 
 More? 
 Yeah. 
 Would you like some more juice, sweetie? 
 Yeah. 
 Martin, my man. 
 Oh, hey, buddy. 
 Hi. 
 Now, Martin, it is wonderful to have you here this morning, but may I ask where your parents think you are right now? 
 Like they care. 
 What? 
 That was a joke. Um, I left them a note. 
 Good. 
 Your dad, Noah, seems like an interesting guy. 
 What's he do? 
 He's a teacher. 
 He's pretty lame. 
 Well, why is it lame to be a teacher? 
 I don't know. 
 It's just... It's not like what you guys do. 
 I was a teacher when I was young. 
 World's greatest teacher ever. 
 Thank you. First grade. 
 Sorry. 
 That's all right. 
 Maybe he's not lame because he's a teacher. 
 Maybe he's just lame because he's your dad. 
 Maybe. 
 And speaking of teaching, you will never guess who I ran into. 
 That little redhead who was in your class the year that dad died, that had a crush on Hal. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Mrs. Solloway? 
 Yes, Martin's here. He's fine. 
 No, we just had breakfast. 
 No, the boys wanted him early to help with a new mare. 
 I'm... 
 I'm sorry to concern you. 
 You're very welcome. 
 You too. 
 Good-bye. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Yeah. Fine. 
 It was Martin's mom. 
 She didn't have a clue he was here. 
 She didn't even ask to speak to him. 
 She was barely even worried. 
 She called, Alison. 
 Her son slept here last night, and she's only just noticed he's gone? 
 She has four children. 
 Yeah, well, so what? 
 So she might have a bit on her mind. 
 No, she doesn't. 
 She's rich. 
 [Horse neighs] 
 [Both speaking indistinctly] 
 All right, then. 
 Got it? 
 Yeah. 
 You're riding a horse. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You look good up there. 
 Oh, my God. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What are you doing? 
 I followed you this morning. 
 What? 
 After you left the hotel. 
 Why? 
 You left so quickly, I thought you might be hiding something from me. 
 It turns out I was right. 
 What was in that cooler? 
 You want to tell me what the f*ck you think you were doing? 
 No. 
 No? 
 I trusted you. 
 Sorry. 
 You should be f*cking sorry. 
 Don't yell at me. 
 You deal f*cking coke? 
 Do you know how stupid that is? 
 Yes. 
 Do you know what happens to you if you get caught? 
 Yes. 
 Then what the hell are you doing? 
 [Scoffs] You wouldn't understand. 
 Try to explain it to me. 
 Well, I can't. 
 Try to explain to me how knowing what can happen... 
 I don't f*cking care what happens to me. 
 Don't you get it? 
 I don't f*cking care if I live or die or go to jail or space. 
 I don't give a sh... 
 You are going to jail eventually. 
 You must know that. 
 We don't have a choice. 
 The ranch doesn't sustain itself. 
 So sell it! 
 We can't. 
 Of course you can. 
 No. 
 Do you think me being here with you is by accident? 
 This is a choice. 
 This is a choice. 
 You should have told me. 
 Sorry. 
 Why didn't you? 
 I just didn't think it mattered. 
 My son is there every f*cking day. 
 Are they doing coke around him? 
 No, of course not. 
 We don't do it ourselves. We don't bring it to the ranch. 
 We don't sell to kids, ever. 
 We have rules. 
 Oh, how principled of you. 
 Well, if you want to go, just... just go. 
 Yeah, I will. 
 First, there's something else I've got to tell you. 
 [Horse neighs] 
 Cole? 
 Cole. 
 Give me a minute. 
 You saw Oscar call the police? 
 You actually saw him? 
 Yes, I told you, yes. 
 Because I didn't see you when I came by. 
 I was in the back. 
 Hey, Scotty, you got the keys? 
 Yep. 
 All right, let's wrap it up. 
 Cole, we need to dump this sh1t, throw it in the ocean. 
 Why don't you go back to the ranch? 
 Find someplace on the edge of the property... 
 Someplace discreet. Make sure nobody's watching. 
 Dig a hole. I'll bring the chest. 
 You take Hal. 
 I'm telling you, man- if you bury this sh1t, someone's gonna find it. 
 Hal, please. Shut the f*ck up, okay? 
 Look, I'll drive you. 
 No, I'll go by myself. 
 If I'm gonna get caught with half a key of coke, I'd rather be alone. 
 You stay here with Caleb. It's safer. 
 When the cops show, just act like you're working at a taxi dispatch. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Knock at door] 
 [Knock at door] 
 [Knock at door] 
 Hey, there. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Snorting, spits] 
 Oh, you dropped something. 
 What are you doing here? 
 You f*cking nark. 
 Nark. 
 My man, I'm an average j-o-e looking to score some d-r-u-gs. 
 You called the cops. 
 Uh, don't know what you're talking about. 
 You have exactly six seconds to leave, or I'm gonna tear your f*cking head off! 
 Caleb! Caleb! 
 Caleb, take it easy! 
 f*ck this m*therf*cker! 
 No, someone's been spreading some rumors about me, man. 
 I didn't call anyone! 
 f*ck you, dude! 
 She heard you! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Really? Really? 
 What, you didn't call... 
 Fascinating, no. 
 Get the f*ck off her. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay. 
 I might have given the impression on calling the cops. 
 Sometimes I like to pick up the phone, practice what I would say to them if you ever... 
 Who the f*ck do you think you're f*cking with? 
 It hasn't happened yet! Hasn't happened yet, huh? 
 Look, go to Cole. 
 Tell him it was all bullshit, okay? 
 What? Huh? 
 You heard what he's saying. 
 He's making the whole thing up. 
 He's lying! 
 Yeah, what would I have to gain from that, huh? 
 You've clearly moved the stash, right? 
 What the f*ck do you know? 
 The cops showed up now, they'd find nothing, and I'd be a f*cking asshole. 
 Come on, get out of here. 
 Let me deal with this, okay? 
 Go, go. 
 All this time, I thought you were in mourning. 
 If you wanted to f*ck someone, Bailey, you could've f*cked me. 
 You didn't have to be some married yuppie's summer slut. 
 Get away from... 
 Ah! 
 Get the f*ck out of here. 
 Come on. 
 Get the f*ck out of here! Now! 
 All right, all right, I'm going. 
 Sh... 
 sh1t. f*ck! 
 Why do you always act like such a f*cking pussy? 
 f*ck you. 
 I don't like how this went down much either, Cole. 
 If all it's gonna take to get Oscar off our ass is the permit for that f*cking bowling alley, then so be it. 
 We go down to the town council tomorrow morning, we rescind our position, and it's done. 
 So far as I'm concerned, we're back in business. 
 Thank God, common sense finally f*cking prevails. 
 What's gonna stop this guy from pulling this sh1t again? 
 What if he actually calls the cops? 
 Hal, you need to f*cking lower your voice and calm the f*ck down. 
 And you need to get that finger out of my f*cking face. 
 Hal? Hal! 
 [Sighs] 
 I thought you went home. 
 This needs to stop. 
 Ali, look, he was just f*cking with you because he has some twisted thing for you, and you fell for it because you're a little too trusting sometimes, but we're okay, all right? 
 We still got eyes and ears at the precinct... we're fine. 
 If it's not Oscar, it's gonna be someone else... 
 Ali, please. 
 Some banker from the city who gets busted for possession. 
 Cole, we're not done with this. 
 Not now. 
 Look, if the police offer a guy like that a deal, what stops him from turning us in? 
 What do you want me to do? 
 We're 100k in the hole right now. 
 How am I gonna make that money if I don't sell the rest of that sh1t? 
 Sell the ranch. 
 What? 
 Sell it. 
 Let's be honest, Cole. 
 We're miserable here. 
 It's not just about us. 
 Our entire family depends upon this ranch. 
 Where are they supposed to go? 
 They can go anywhere they want. 
 Think about it. 
 We could start new lives. 
 We could... 
 We could finally move on. 
 We could move on from what? 
 Say it. I want to hear you say it. 
 We could move on from what? 
 Cole, please don't. 
 There is no moving on. 
 Cole. 
 Not now. 
 Cole! 
 What? 
 Hey, buddy, what are you still doing here? 
 Tell him. 
 The mare's gone. 
 What? 
 I opened up the stable. 
 The horse ran away. 
 God damn it! 
 [Glass shatters] 
 You come with me. 
 [Sighs] 
 Martin. 
 I'll drive you home. 
 So why'd you do it? 
 Do you ever do things and... 
 You don't know why? 
 Yeah, sometimes I... 
 [Sighs] I don't know why I do anything. 
 Thank you. 
 Come on, go inside. 
 Hi. 
 Um... 
 I-I thought about what you said before, and... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't want that life anymore. 
 I want to start over... 
 With you. 
 Yeah, I've been thinking about it, too, and... 
 After today, I'd have to be insane to keep this going. 
 We're leaving at the end of next week anyway, so... 
 Let's just end it now.
