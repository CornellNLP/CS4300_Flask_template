 Alison : Previously on The Affair... 
 [squealing tires] 
 Ah! 
 Oh. 
 I thought long and hard about it. 
 It just didn't feel right to me anymore. 
 How much of this is based on what happened between you and... what was her actual name? 
 It's fiction, Harry. 
 Jeremy : I understand what a difficult time this must be for both of you. 
 Helen : Are you still seeing her? 
 I don't want her anywhere near my kids. 
 Your mom and I, we are getting a divorce. 
 Why are you divorcing her? 
 I fell in love with somebody else. 
 Ah, f*ck! 
 So you're happy here? 
 Alison : Yeah. I am. 
 Your daughter was the coolest, prettiest girl at Williams. 
 I just can't believe I finally got her. 
 Jeffries : So I'm worried about your bail hearing. 
 I've known this judge my whole life. 
 His wife was killed a few years back and it turned him hard. 
 But you go to trial? 
 25 for vehicular homicide if they can convince the jury you had motive. 
 Who the f*ck are you? 
 I'm his lawyer. 
 I can't afford you, John. 
 I'm paying.

 [creaking wood] 
 Morning. 
 Morning, sleepy head. 
 What time is it? 
 It's 7:00. I gotta go. 
 Why did you let me sleep so late? 
 I couldn't wake you. You looked so peaceful. 
 I wish you could stay. 
 Mmm. I do too. 
 But the sooner I do this, the sooner I can just be with you. 
 I feel a little weird, being here without you. 
 Why? They're so nice. 
 I know, but what do they think about me? 
 [laughs] What do you mean? 
 Well, who do they think I am? Your wife? 
 I don't know. I don't know what they think. 
 What did Harry tell them? 
 He told them I needed a place to write. 
 About me? 
 Ah. 
 Harry doesn't know I'm here, does he? 
 I'm gonna miss this train. Come on. 
 We have to talk about this when you get back. 
 I agree, 100%. 
 About what exactly? 
 Who I am to you. 
 You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. 
 Oh. 
 f*ck, I really gotta go. 
 Just a quickie before you leave. 
 No, no, I know how this goes. 
 You want an orgasm and then another one and another one. 
 Oh, right. 
 I'm the one with the insatiable sexual appetite. 
 You are. It's terrible. You're killing me. 
 You're an asshole. [laughs] 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 Oh, I forgot. The, uh... toilet's broken. 
 What? How? 
 I don't know. The thingy came off in my hand just now. 
 What thingy? 
 Ask Yvonne to call a plumber, will you? 
 I meant to, but now I'm late, so... 
 Yes. Go. I'll take care of it. 
 Just tell her you're my sister. 
 [laughs] Get the f*ck out of here.

 Alison! 
 Hi. 
 What are you doing, walking to town? 
 Uh, I was, yeah. 
 It's six miles. You sure you want to do that? 
 No, I'm fine. I like walking. It's... 
 Get in. I'll give you a lift. I'm on my way to the dump. 
 Thank you. 
 [laughs softly] 
 All right. 
 [♪ reflective music ♪]

 It's beautiful, isn't it? 
 It's God's country. 
 I think so too. 
 [chuckles] 
 Yvonne wants us to sell and move back to the city. 
 No, you can't. 
 Oh. I'm sorry. 
 No. 
 Don't apologize. I feel the same way. 
 But Yvonne's a city girl, Born and raised on the Upper West Side. 
 She's allergic to everything up here. 
 [laughs softly] 
 You must be from a small town. 
 I am. 
 Yep. 
 Well, thanks for the lift. 
 My pleasure. Call me when you want to come home. 
 I...I didn't bring a phone. 
 Good for you. 
 Well, I'll be coming back this way in a few hours. 
 If I see you, I'll pick you up. 
 If not, you look like a resourceful kid. 
 Thanks again. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 [children playing in background] 
 [boys talking indistinctly] 
 boy : Go! Go! 
 Aw... ha ha! 
 [laughs] 
 Yeah! 
 How's it taste? 
 It's great, thank you. 
 Can I ask you a question? 
 Hm? 
 How much do you make an hour? 
 Why, are you looking for a job? 
 No, no, I was just wondering. 
 It's 7.50. It's not much, but tips help. 
 Right. Thank you. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Well, hello to you, too. 
 It's good to see you again, Alison. 
 I love what you've done with your hair. 
 How did you find me? 
 Why? Is it supposed to be a big secret? 
 You in the Witness Protection Program now? 
 I don't think you should be here. 
 I think you should leave. 
 Relax, I got the address from Jane. 
 I just came to bring you your stuff. 
 [sighs] I asked her to send me my clothes. 
 And I thought, nice guy that I am, maybe I'd save her the shipping cost. 
 Mind if I sit? 
 Yes. 
 [sighs] 
 It's a nice place you got here. 
 Cozy, woodsy. 
 So how have you been, Ali? 
 I'm fine. How are you? 
 You seem a little nervous to see me. 
 Well, do you have any weapons on you? 
 Well, do you want to come check? 
 No. 
 Did you read it? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 He doesn't want me to. 
 You mind if I... you know what? 
 I just thought that maybe I could come here, drop off your stuff, and we could shoot the sh1t for a little while. 
 Maybe clear the air? 
 Obviously that's not something that you're interested in. 
 So I only have one question for you, Alison. 
 Where's your toilet? 
 [chuckles] 
 [murmurs under breath] 
 You should see the look on your face. 
 You can't use it. 
 I just drove four hours to bring you your clothes. 
 I need to take a piss. 
 Too bad. It's broken. 
 What is? 
 The toilet. 
 I...I was supposed to call the landlady and tell her, but I forgot. 
 Fine. I'll fix it. Where are the tools? 
 Look, forget it. I'm calling a plumber. 
 What, he doesn't have tools? 
 I'll get mine from the truck. 
 Yvonne : Yoo-hoo! 
 [laughs] Hello. 
 Oh, I finally put your welcome basket together. 
 A month overdue. I know, I'm sorry. 
 But better late than never, right? 
 Well, we have all sorts of goodies here. 
 This is maple syrup that Robert tapped from these very trees. 
 Here we have some local wine and cheese. 
 Burrata. Comes from the cows right down the road. 
 And this is apple cider from the fall harvest. 
 I-i-is, uh, Noah here? 
 Uh, no, Noah's in the city working. 
 Oh, pity. 
 How's the book coming along? 
 [exhales] Really well, I think. 
 Have you read it? 
 Not yet, no. [chuckles] 
 It's a horrible thing to love a writer. 
 All their secret worlds, their fantasies. 
 [footsteps] 
 Oh, hello. 
 Afternoon. 
 Uh, I'm sorry. Um, Cole, this is Yvonne. 
 She's the owner of the property. 
 And Yvonne, this is Cole. 
 He came by to drop off some of my things and then he stayed to fix the toilet. 
 Is there something wrong with the toilet? 
 No, not anymore. 
 I got a long drive ahead of me. I should probably head out. 
 It's good seeing you again, Ali. 
 You, too. 
 Afternoon, ma'am. 
 Come back anytime. 
 Who was he? 
 Just an old friend of mine. 
 Is he single? 
 Oh, yeah... well, I think he is... I... 
 I have a niece who would love him. She's just like me. 
 She's got a terrible weakness for a guy with rough hands. 
 [approaching footsteps] 
 Almost forgot the most important piece of the puzzle. 
 I'm sure you didn't mean to leave that behind. 
 He's a bit intense, isn't he? 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, it's fine, I... 
 Say, what are you doing for the rest of the afternoon? 
 Uh, I-I don't have any plans. 
 Why don't you come up to the house for a cup of tea? 
 I feel truly terrible that we haven't had a chance to connect. 
 You know, I'm usually very good about making our guests feel at home. 
 It's just that it's been insane at work and with Robert's injury, and I haven't had a minute to myself and I'm afraid my manners have gone right out the window. 
 You must give me a chance to make it up to you. 
 How about 3:00? 
 Okay. 
 Oh, wonderful. 
 I'll see you then. 
 Yvonne : That's the tour. 
 Well, you have such a beautiful home. 
 Thank you. 
 A house, it's... it's like a marriage, actually. 
 You gotta be in it for the long haul if you ever want to see it come together. 
 What kind of tea can I get you? 
 I'll... I'll take anything, really. 
 So polite. You clearly had excellent parents. 
 All righty, I'm making Moroccan mint. 
 Oh! Darling. Look who I found. 
 Hey. I see you got back here all by yourself. 
 How was the dump? 
 The dump is literally Robert's favorite place in town. 
 You never know what you'll find at the dump. 
 Someone dropped off a Herman Miller chair today. 
 No! 
 Yeah. 
 That's astonishing. 
 I saved that chair and I'm gonna refurbish it and when it's done, you're not gonna be allowed to sit in it. 
 You rest. 
 I made you lunch. 
 What happened? 
 Ugh, I had a knee surgery a few weeks ago. 
 It's f*cking annoying. 
 I'll tell you what's annoying. 
 The fact that you won't do your physical therapy exercises because you think you're smarter than Hugo. 
 I am smarter than Hugo. 
 Who's Hugo? 
 He's this ridiculously expensive physical therapist that Yvonne imported from France. 
 He's from New Jersey. 
 Who has choreographed an entire exercise routine for me because what he really wants to do is dance. 
 Hugo made the mistake of telling Robert that he had been in a ballet corp when he was younger, and now Robert can't take anything he says seriously. 
 The best thing you can do after knee surgery is just walk. 
 How do you know that? 
 Everybody knows that. The whole internet knows it. 
 Actually, the best thing you could do is work out with an elastic band. 
 A lot of people make the mistake of focusing on strength building, but in the beginning range of motion is much more important. 
 Oh, you sound like you know what you're talking about. 
 Sit, dear. 
 Oh, well, I was a nurse for a while. 
 You were a nurse? Fascinating. 
 Well, what are you doing now? 
 Uh... 
 I don't actually know. 
 I know that sounds ridiculous because I'm 32, but I, uh... 
 I guess I'm still trying to figure it out. 
 Welcome to the club. 
 [phone rings] 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 I have a conference call. I forgot. 
 You know, Yvonne has been looking for a personal assistant. 
 Oh? 
 Yeah, someone to help her and me around the house. 
 She really shouldn't be here at all. 
 She usually spends Monday through Thursdays in the city for work. 
 What does she do? 
 She's the head of Radford House. 
 Uh... 
 It's a major publishing house. 
 Oh. 
 [chuckles] 
 I don't know anything about publishing. 
 My God, I like you. 
 Anyway, our last assistant wasn't competent. 
 We had to fire her, but it's been a disaster here without her. 
 Yvonne's afraid to leave me alone. 
 Yvonne : Well, I don't understand why this wasn't done when I asked, Shane. 
 I specifically laid out the numbers that needed to be run and you said you'd have it on her desk... 
 She's starting to resent me for keeping her here. 
 If I don't figure out how to get her back to the city soon, it's going to get ugly. 
 Uh... I'd be happy to help. 
 It's not a glamorous job, and you seem horribly overqualified for this position. 
 I just thought, since you're here and you seem kind of bored and we get along so well... 
 I'll take it. 
 I told you, I should have fired Shane after the holidays, but you made me feel bad because his wife had just had those hideous twins. 
 Yvonne. 
 Meet your new assistant. 
 Oh, God bless you. 
 [vehicle approaches] 
 Hi. 
 How was your day? 
 Fine. 
 What are you making? 
 Dover sole. 
 Does that taste fishy? 
 Well, it's a fish. 
 Whatever. 
 What's wrong? 
 A sh1t day. 
 What happened? 
 Where do I start? The mediator was a burn-out. 
 Whitney won't speak to me, my mother-in-law's homicidal. 
 Harry hates my book. 
 Not gonna publish it, so in a month I will be broke, jobless, homeless, and I will have lost custody of my kids. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Is there anything I can do to help? 
 What's going on with your house? 
 What do you mean? 
 Are you selling it or what? 
 [small laugh] 
 I-I don't think so, I... 
 You hungry? Dinner's almost ready. 
 
 
 
 Where's my manuscript? 
 I, uh, I put it in a drawer for safekeeping. 
 Have you... have you read it? 
 No, of course not. 
 I don't want you to read it before it's done. 
 No, I... I was worried it would get blown away. 
 It was... breezy today. 
 And guess what I did today. 
 What did you do? 
 I got a job. 
 [laughs] Where? 
 With Robert and Yvonne. 
 They've asked me to be their personal assistant. 
 What? 
 What, is something wrong with that? 
 Uh... 
 Yes, Alison. That's f*cking weird. 
 Why? 
 Because we're their guests, and they invited me here to finish my novel. 
 What, so I can't work for them? 
 Are you working for free? 
 No. 
 Oh. That is... 
 That is completely inappropriate. 
 They're already doing me a favor and now they gotta pay you. 
 Noah, they offered me a job. 
 You should have said no. 
 Well, I didn't want to. 
 You know, I can't deal with this right now. 
 [sighs] 
 [door opens] 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 I'm an asshole. 
 Yeah. Ha. 
 Forgive me. 
 It's okay. 
 This is hard, isn't it? I mean, it's not just me, right? 
 No, it's not just you. 
 I just want you to be happy, that's all. 
 I just want you to be happy. 
 Oh. 
 Oh. 
 I am happy. 
 You sure? 
 Oh, oh. 
 I love you. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, God. 
 [door shuts] 
 It works. 
 Yvonne called a plumber? 
 That's right. 
 Wow, look at this. 
 [small giggle] 
 What are we drinking to? 
 To us. 
 To us. 
 [elevator door dings] 
 Hey. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 I'm sorry, and you are? 
 I'm his wife. 
 Ah. The famous Ms. Alison Bailey. 
 It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Jon Gottlief. 
 Yeah, I know who you are. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Providing counsel to your husband. 
 What? 
 I'm his lawyer. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 What... what, did Noah call you? 
 Helen did. 
 She shouldn't be getting involved. 
 I'm his wife now. 
 Yes, we are all quite painfully aware of that. 
 So any decisions concerning my husband's legal representation need to go through me. 
 Do they? Really? 
 Because your husband has already accepted my services. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 From here on in, we will do our very best to keep you in the loop. 
 What, is she paying you? 
 Yes, of course. 
 That's not acceptable. 
 If you will excuse me. 
 Ms. Bailey, I am sure that this will work out exactly how it... should. 
 [woman over PA in background] 
 [engine turns] 
 64 Elizabeth Lane, Montauk. 
 So how's business? 
 You speak English? 
 Yeah, of course I speak English. 
 I asked how business is this summer. 
 It's good. It's busy. 
 You been driving out here for awhile? 
 Uh... no. No, it's my first summer driving. 
 I knew it. 
 I can tell by the way you drive. 
 It's a nice area we got out here, isn't it? 
 Yeah, I like it. 
 I've been here for 40 years. 
 It's a long time. 
 It's changed significantly. 
 You kids have no idea. 
 You're from where, Indiana? Nebraska? 
 When we first bought property out here, it was a farm and fishing community. 
 Our friends thought we were crazy. 
 So far away, nothing to do. 
 But I loved it. I loved the peace. 
 I loved the way the corn grew so high in summer and then just disappeared one day. 
 I loved the colors in the fall. 
 The fallow fields in the winter. 
 The way the ocean changes like a moody woman. 
 Bright and blue one moment, cold and gray the next. 
 It's just not the same anymore. 
 And it'll never go back, you know? 
 That's the terrible thing about living. 
 You never get to go back no matter how badly you miss it. 
 Just gotta keep moving forward. 
 I'm leaving my wife. 
 I'm going back even though I know it's impossible. 
 Does that make me a fool? 
 I don't know, sir. 
 You'd have to tell me more about the situation. 
 [chuckles] 
 It's a long story. 
 My son-in-law left my daughter recently. 
 He's a pathetic son of a bitch, and as far as I'm concerned, good riddance. 
 But it got me thinking. 
 If that poor, talentless schmuck thinks he deserves to be happy, why don't I? 
 So I went online and I tracked down this girl I used to know. 
 I called her up. 
 And then I went to see her, and now we're in love. 
 I just took her to Barcelona for a weekend. 
 What do you think of that? 
 [soft laugh] 
 That sounds like fun. 
 [laughs] 
 [sighs] 
 You married? 
 Me? No, no, I'm not married. 
 I've been married for over 40 years. 
 40 wasted years. 
 So what happened to your son-in-law? 
 Sorry? 
 Your son-in-law. 
 Or, I guess, your ex-son-in-law now. 
 Whatever happened to him? 
 Oh. I feel bad for the guy, actually. 
 He's 45, has no savings. All the money was ours. 
 I heard he lost his job. 
 Some people are just destined to fail. 
 Nothing you can do about it. 
 Nice talking to you, son. Take care. 
 You too, sir. 
 [engine turns] 
 [woman screams] 
 Nino. Nino. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, no, I'm fine. 
 I'm... I'm really sorry. I didn't see him there. 
 Because he's two feet tall and he moves like a jackrabbit. 
 I'm sorry. Are you sure you're okay? 
 Oh, my fault. My fault. I can't believe I just did that. 
 Well, he's fine. Nothing happened. Don't worry. 
 [speaking Spanish] 
 He yours? 
 No. Um, I'm his babysitter. 
 Ah. 
 I'm Cole, by the way. 
 Luisa. 
 [both speaking Spanish] 
 Nice to meet you. 
 You're crazy. You're crazy. 
 [sighs] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 That new registration come in? 
 Yeah, it's, uh, in your cubby. 
 [taxi radio dispatch in background] 
 Oh... 
 I'm headed back out. 
 Where do you want me? 
 Home, man. You've been driving for 24 hours. 
 What are you talking about? I'm up. I'm good. 
 Oh, no, you're not. You're done. 
 Come on. Don't be a dick. 
 It's not legal, man. 
 You gotta get some sleep. 
 [soft laugh] 
 Sure thing. You're the boss. 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 Hey, big brother. Long time, no see. 
 Scotty. 
 What's going on, man? 
 What the f*ck? Where you going, man? 
 I'm a busy man. 
 Yeah, is that why you haven't returned my calls in the last month? 
 Or anyone's? 
 When was the last time you saw Mom, huh? 
 She's not doing great. 
 Hmm? 
 I don't care. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 What's going on with the house? 
 What? 
 Your house. What's going on with it? Is she selling? 
 What? 
 [laughs] 
 What? 
 [coughing] 
 I have no idea. 
 Well, have you heard from her? 
 Nope. 
 Because you're sitting on a lot of money there, brother. 
 Money that we could all use, and as long as you are still married to her, you are entitled to half of it. 
 You should see where Mom's living right now, man. 
 It's not pretty. And Mary Kate's pregnant. 
 They're sleeping on Mom's pull-out couch. 
 Is that what you want for your family? 
 Scotty, I'm going to give you three seconds to get out of the front of this car and then I'm going to run you the f*ck down. 
 Look, I know that you're having a lot of feelings right now, Cole, but there are other people's lives at stake here, okay, besides your own! 
 [exhales] 
 Ali? 
 I'm sorry. I thought you were out. 
 What are you doing? 
 Alison asked me to send her some of her things. 
 I-I tried to get in touch with you about it, but you never pick up your phone. 
 So how is she? 
 I think she's good. 
 I haven't really heard from her either, just a couple of texts. 
 Where is she? 
 Somewhere in the Hudson Valley. 
 I'm not supposed to know that, am I? 
 No. 
 I'm so sorry, Cole. 
 I'll do it. 
 Just give me the address. 
 I'll mail it out to her tomorrow. 
 I really don't mind. 
 I appreciate that, Jane. 
 Right now, you're trespassing in my house and potentially stealing my property. 
 So why don't you leave me that f*cking address and if I wake up in a good mood tomorrow, I will send her her goody bag. 
 Otherwise she'll just have to buy some new underwear, okay? 
 Okay? 
 Okay.

 You're going to have to stop the car.

 Is it all right if I just sit here for a little while? 
 Of course, honey. 
 Hello?

 How have you been? 
 I'm fine. 
 Really? 
 Yes, really. 
 Okay, good. 
 I've been worried about you. 
 Don't be. 
 Thank you for bringing my stuff. You didn't have to do that. 
 You could have just shipped it. 
 It's okay. I was coming up this way anyway. 
 Why? 
 Uh, there's a horse I wanted to look at. 
 I thought you lost the ranch. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 How's Cherry? 
 She's fine. 
 What about the boys? 
 They're all fine, too. 
 Mary Kate's pregnant. 
 Wow. 
 That's great. Congratulate her for me. 
 So what do you do up here all day? 
 I read. I wander about. 
 You look happy. 
 The change is nice. 
 What about him? 
 Noah? 
 He a good guy? 
 Is he good to you? 
 Yeah. He is. 
 Let me make you some eggs. 
 No, no, I'm fine. 
 It'll take two seconds, Cole. I can tell you're still hungry. 
 You know, I thought about something funny the other day that I wanted to tell you. 
 What was it? 
 [exhales] 
 I don't know. I can't remember now. 
 Remember that long run we took on New Year's Day, before I got pregnant? 
 Went out to the lighthouse and back and then we made pancakes and we sat by the fire and read... that afternoon? 
 Yeah, I remember. 
 I've been thinking about that day recently. 
 That was a really good day, wasn't it? 
 Yes, that was a good day. 
 I needed these. 
 Thank you for bringing them. 
 Can I ask you a question before I head back? 
 Are you ever coming home? 
 I don't think so. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That's okay. 
 I just needed to hear that. 
 Cole. 
 Thank you so much for coming all this way. 
 You're welcome. 
 Promise me you'll keep in touch. 
 Of course I will.
