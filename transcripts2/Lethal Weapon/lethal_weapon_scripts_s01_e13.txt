 Hey, babe. 
 No, still at work. 
 It's these high-frequency traders. 
 I got to clean up their mess. 
 No, you can go ahead and eat without me. 
 I, uh... I'll find something here. 
 All right. 
 Okay. I love you, too. 
 (both moan)

 You're such a big, bad liar. 
 I know.

 Who are you? 
 Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. 
 I was just on my way out. 
 I'm Feather. 
 Feather? 
 If Riana had a friend named Feather, I would've remembered. 
 Who's Riana? 
 "Who's Riana?" Okay, that takes me back to my first question: Who are you? 
 Roger jr. : Feather, you forgot your belt. 
 D-Dad... y-you're up. 
 Yeah, I'm up. I was just getting to know your friend, Feather. 
 Sorry. I'm such a space case. 
 W-We were just... upstairs. Yeah, making decorative belts. 
 Studying. 
 Otherwise, how would someone just lose their belt, like, poof, "My belt is gone"? 
 You're hilarious, Mr. Murtaugh. 
 It's Detective Murtaugh. 
 Not that hilarious. 
 Can I just say, we're all adults here. 
 Oh, are we? 
 You raised a great young man. 
 You should be proud. 
 Bye, babe. 
 (door opens, closes) 
 Dad, uh, let me explain. 
 We-we had... 
 I know what you had. 
 You had the audacity to bring a girl in my house while your mother and I are up there sleeping? 
 And you think we wouldn't find out? 
 It's not a big deal. 
 It's not a big deal? 
 Well, guess what? 
 I'm grounded forever. 
 Maybe longer. 
 We'll talk about this tomorrow. Get upstairs. 
 (chuckles) 
 (seagulls cawing) 
 (snoring) 
 Woman : Mm. 
 Mm, morning. 
 Yep. 
 That's what it is. (groans) 
 You got somewhere to be? 
 Uh, yeah. I got this thing that I, uh, just completely forgot about. 
 Um... yeah, look, there's some OJ in the fri-- no, do not drink the OJ that is in that refrigerator. 
 Um... 
 (Murtaugh laughs) 
 My boy got some action last night. 
 What? Who did? 
 RJ. 
 Not only is he Princeton-bound, but it turns out, he's inherited his dad's charms with the ladies. 
 That's good news. (chuckles) 
 Yeah, that's what-- hey. 
 What in the...? 
 Is that a bathing suit you got on? 
 Uh, all my pants were stained up and I didn't want to look unprofessional. 
 Okay, you know what's unprofessional? 
 Is you blinding me with those pasty legs. 
 Exactly. They need a little vitamin D. 
 Riggs. 
 You gonna tell me that this right here is not even a little weird, even for you? 
 Uh, this line of questioning is a little weird. 
 And uncomfortable. 
 (sighing): Okay, it's gonna be that kind of day. 
 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 Okay, so who is he? 
 Dale Reynolds, 35. 
 Had quite a party followed by an accidental overdose. 
 Or not so accidental. 
 The bluish skin, bleeding foam around his mouth, all point to an OD, but... check out the knot in the tourniquet. 
 Bailey : It's on the outside of his arm. 
 Which means he had help. 
 What you got there, legs? 
 A wedding ring stuffed in his pocket. 
 Dale Reynolds, you cheating b*st*rd. 
 Murtaugh : Okay, well, someone had to be the last person to see him alive. 
 So, let's find that girlfriend, boyfriend, intern, escort... 
 (woman laughing) 
 (echoing): Nice place you got here. 
 Murtaugh : And make sure that you call his, um... 
 Bailey : His wife? 
 Murtaugh : Yeah. 
 Bailey : Yeah, tell her we found her husband dead in a hotel room, smelling like another woman's cheap perfume. 
 I'm on it. 
 Is that what that smell is? (sniffs) 
 Doesn't seem to be coming off the corpse. 
 I think... it's coming from... 
 Riggs? 
 (water running) 
 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 Sinner. 
 Me? 
 No, him. 
 Avery :  Bailey, what do you got? 
 There's security footage of a van arriving and leaving the hotel garage that times out with our killer. 
 Okay, do you have a plate? 
 A partial and we're looking into it. 
 Good enough news. 
 Mr. City Attorney, in the house. 
 What a rare, unexpected treat. 
 Did I-- did I know you were...? 
 I just thought I'd pop in. 
 Awesome. You heard we caught a grizzly one. 
 You're hear to scrub in? 
 We need to talk. 
 I have concerns. 
 Never a great opening. 
 Martin Riggs... how's he doing? 
 Riggs? He's... he's doing well. 
 Adjusting to the culture. 
 He-he should be here any minute, you could ask him yourself. 
 I intend to. 
 But I want to hear from you first. 
 Make sure there aren't any issues I should have heard about already. 
 None-- none that I can think of... off the top of my head. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 If you're sick, you should go home. 
 I'm not sick. 
 You threw up. 
 Barely. It was more about your cleanse. 
 Murtaugh : Look, all I'm saying is that you're not yourself, and when you are yourself, you're barely function... 
 Avery : Roger. 
 You know Ronnie Delgado? He had some concerns about your partner, Riggs. I was hoping you could, uh... 
 Why? 'Cause he wore shorts today? 
 Shorts? 
 Roger, maybe you could tell the city attorney how well your partner is doing. 
 Is he drinking? 
 Behaving erratically? 
 (laughs) 
 Riggs? Drinking? 
 Um, um... (clears throat) 
 I don't know what he does after hours, but you're asking: is he drinking during the day? 
 Is-is what you're asking. 
 Where is he? 
 Hmm. 
 He's probably doing paperwork. 
 He loves paperwork. 
 Avery : He does a lot of paperwork. 
 I'm gonna see if I can find him. 
 Yes. 
 Good idea. 
 Good idea. 
 I think you can. 
 (sighs) 
 (grunts) 
 Riggs? 
 Are we okay? 
 Oh, hey, Doc. 
 Yeah, just another day in paradise. 
 What are you doing under a vending machine? 
 Well, I needed a break and this is a break room. 
 And now, I'm trying to get... 
 (straining): this... little... 
 (grunts) 
 Got it. (groans) 
 (sighs) 
 (chip bag rips open) 
 So, is this it? 
 Have we finally arrived at rock-bottom? 
 No, there's still some places to go. 
 Oh, Duke. How'd we do? 
 Uh, I got most of what you wanted. 
 Except for your wallet, I couldn't find it. 
 No worries. Thanks, buddy. 
 Oh, okay, so you're eating floor chips and you sent a uni to retrieve your pants? 
 Ah. 
 A wool cap. 
 It is getting chilly outside. Duke! 
 This is looking like a pretty clear cry for help. 
 (sighs) 
 Well, as usual, you're not wrong. 
 Would you like to help me out? 
 Yes. Yes, I would. 
 Well, apparently, I've misplaced my wallet. 
 And I'm starving, so if I could borrow a buck, that would be great. 
 I'm sorry, Riggs, all I have is a ten. 
 No problem, that'll work perfectly. 
 One successful cry for help. 
 Avery :  Be honest. 
 Is he getting worse? 
 I don't know. It's Riggs. 
 One minute, I think he's doing better. 
 The next minute, he has me jumping off a skyscraper into a pool. 
 So, worse. You're-you're saying worse. 
 No, what I'm saying is: I'm too busy trying to stay alive than to crack the mystery of the shorts-wearing detective. 
 All right, fair enough. But now, Delgado's got his eyes on him. 
 Remember, I put you two together so that you could lift Riggs up, not so that he would... 
 Bring me down? 
 Woman :  Heroin? 
 It wasn't his doing. 
 Your husband was murdered by a forced overdose. 
 And, um... what about the woman? Hmm? 
 And the hotel room? 
 Was that his doing? 
 (sighs) 
 Was there anyone that-that had it out for your husband, or had a grudge against him, anything like that? 
 Um, a couple of months ago somebody threw a brick through our window in the middle of the night. 
 Okay. That's a start. 
 Do you know who? 
 No. But-but Dale did. 
 He said that it was a work thing. 
 And that I shouldn't worry, that he would get a restraining order.

 Murtaugh :  Suspect's name is Ben Garvey. 
 He's got a restraining order. 
 And he's got a warrant for violating said restraining order. 
 Perfect. A daily double. 
 Ben Garvey! 
 Yeah. 
 Of the brick-throwing Garveys? 
 Murtaugh : Hey, LAPD. 
 We need to ask you a few questions about Dale Reynolds. 
 Yeah, sure.

 Ow. 
 I honestly thought that tarp would hold. (groans) 
 Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's the tarp's fault. 
 Not just nails, two types of screws. 
 And an Allen wrench. 
 You're lucky. 
 No, luck had nothing to do with it. 
 Murtaugh : Ha! 
 I mean, you know, perp had a nail gun pointed at my partner, I had no choice. 
 Really? 
 No choice? 
 Didn't we just talk about our choices? 
 About playing it safe? 
 Or was I imagining that? 
 My options weren't great. 
 Oh, you had options. 
 How about trusting your partner, huh? 
 How-How about waiting for backup? 
 Shooting the guy in the leg? 
 But no, you had to take the one where we plummeted off a building, through a tarp, into a box of nails? 
 I made sure that was a controlled plummet. 
 Oh, you made sure? 
 Yeah, I made sure. 
 Because you got x-ray vision. 
 And you saw what was on the other side of that tarp. 
 You had no idea where we were landing. 
 So, uh, I'm just gonna go... recalibrate the forceps. 
 I think she just made that up. 
 You know what, Riggs? There's gonna come a time when there's nothing on the other side of that tarp. 
 And I'm not letting you bring me down with you. 
 Now get dressed. 
 We have a suspect to interrogate. 
 Garvey :  Dale Reynolds was a snake. 
 He cheated on his wife with my kid sister, Cynthia. 
 And that's why you killed him? 
 I didn't kill him. 
 Are you getting mixed signals with this guy? 
 I'm confused, I don't... 
 The son of a bitch killed Cynthia. 
 He introduced her to heroin. 
 So your sister OD'd? 
 And that's why you killed him. 
 The same way he killed Cynthia. 
 I already told you, I didn't kill him. 
 Even though I hated him, and I wished he was dead. 
 This is... See, this is where we get into, like, that whole confusing problem area. 
 Mr. Garvey? (clears throat) 
 Where were you between the hours of 8:00 and 10:00 last night? 
 I was at church. 
 Riggs : I mean, that's either the greatest alibi of all time or the worst, I genuinely don't know. 
 I don't know.

 Hi. Welcome to St. Valens. 
 The soup kitchen is down this walkway. 
 Yeah, we're LAPD. 
 Which doesn't mean we don't like soup. 
 (chuckles) Rog. 
 Do I detect a chowder? 
 Murtaugh : We're looking for Darryl Patterson. 
 Father Patterson? Yeah, he's in the main sanctuary. 
 And, uh, yeah, it's a fish chowder. 
 With the little, tiny crackers? 
 (phone buzzing) 
 Bailey has a lead on the van. I'm gonna check in with her. 
 So is that a yes or a no on the crackers? 
 Riggs. 
 I'm on it. 
 Patterson : Ben Garvey? 
 Yeah, I saw him here most of the evening. 
 I heard his confession then he sat in on Mass. 
 What'd he confess to? 
 (soft chuckle) Come on, Detective, you know I can't tell you that. 
 Sacred seal of confession. 
 Come on, Father. 
 That's just a wooden box. 
 It's not about the box, it's about what happens when you step inside. 
 You'd be surprised. 
 Yeah? 
 You walk in, unload all your crap, you walk out, clean slate. 
 Seems a little too easy to me. 
 Well, that's an oversimplification. 
 You're welcome to try. 
 Money back guarantee if it doesn't help. 
 I'll pass. 
 Look, you got a fairly large congregation. 
 How would you know if a guy like Ben Garvey slipped out during Mass? 
 What is it you think he did? 
 The man he blames for killing his sister was murdered last night. 
 Well, I'm sorry to hear that, I... 
 I know Ben struggled with Cynthia's loss, but I also know in my heart he couldn't do something like that. 
 Unfortunately, what we know in our hearts doesn't necessarily qualify as hard evidence, Father. 
 Well, evening Mass is live-streamed. 
 Ben Garvey sits up front. 
 (phone buzzing) 
 Would a time-stamped video qualify as hard evidence? 
 Yeah, that would be great if we could get those videos, Father. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 You're welcome back any time, Detective.

 It stands for Worldwide Opportunities of Organic Farms. 
 And you're gonna give up Princeton because you want to be a farmer? 
 Trish : What about your education, honey? 
 Why can't you go to college and have a garden? 
 Do that. 
 Trish : Yeah. 
 Grow your own food. 
 And the we don't have to pay for a meal plan. 
 That's not how it works. 
 You live on farms all around the globe, and me and Feather are gonna start in New Zealand and work our way around. 
 Feather? The girl from the other night? 
 Yeah, the one that lost her belt. 
 What... 
 She lost her belt? 
 You didn't tell me... 
 Where'd her belt go, RJ? 
 Where'd the belt go? 
 You guys are being ridiculous. 
 Okay, look, I get it. 
 You're on this road and you meet this exciting girl, and she says, "Hey, you know what? 
 "There's a whole world out there if you go off-road." 
 Maybe I don't like the road I'm on. 
 Maybe Princeton is your dream. 
 I need to figure out w-what's mine, what I want. 
 Well, I want to get back to the belt, that's what I want. 
 (knocking on door) 
 The thing is, you can get lost, okay? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You can go off-road and never make it back. 
 Trish : Yeah. 
 People do. 
 Howdy. 
 Was this planned? 
 What? Ooh. 
 Dinner. 
 It's not a good time, Riggs. 
 We're having a family, uh... 
 Crisis. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, I'm great in a crisis. 
 Yes, Riggs, please, I can't talk to these people anymore. 
 Oh, come on, they're all right. 
 I mean, your dad can be a little chatty. 
 I did not come empty-handed. 
 Martin, you didn't have to. 
 Oh, forget it. So, uh... what's the problem? 
 Besides all that, RJ wants to blow off college. 
 I want to see the world with my girlfriend, and we're gonna start in New Zealand. 
 Ooh, New Zealand. Wellington, the capital... (clicks tongue) beautiful. 
 Go for it. 
 Thank you. 
 Crisis averted. All right, let's eat. 
 I'm gonna grab a plate. 
 Riggs : Anybody need anything?! 
 (video game gunfire) 
 Feather, huh? 
 Somebody named her that? 
 Yeah. 
 That's a name, all right. 
 He's out there filling RJ's head with more foolishness, if that's even possible. 
 I'm gonna go put an end to this. 
 Roger, don't. 
 Don't interfere. 
 If we push, RJ will push back. 
 So what do we do, just sit back while his life goes down the drain? 
 No, it's a phase. RJ will turn around. 
 I mean, when he finds out how much a ticket to New Zealand costs. 
 Hmm. 
 You love her? 
 I do. 
 Never let her go. You hear me? 
 Yeah. We got plans to go... 
 What did I just say? 
 Y-You said never let her go. 
 Bingo. 
 (Riggs sighs) 
 Feather? 
 She spell that with a "Ph"? 
 What's going on with Riggs? 
 The drinking? 
 Trish : That much drinking. He's drowning in it. 
 I've never seen it this bad before. 
 He should sleep on the couch. 
 Or in the garage. 
 The couch. 
 Or the driveway. 
 (snoring lightly) 
 Hey, you good? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I've got some pillows and sheets and stuff for you. 
 Oh, no need. I am a simple man, buddy. 
 No, the sheet is for the couch, not you. 
 Oh... (clears throat) 
 Yep, yep, yep, yep. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

 I didn't intentionally do it, but I cheated on her.

 Vitals are stable, but she could be out for another couple of days. 
 I'll call you if anything changes. 
 Thank you. 
 Same van, same message left at the scene-- "sinner." 
 So it wasn't Garvey. 
 We got one less suspect and one more victim. 
 What do we know about her? 
 Valerie Rausch, 48. Never married, pays taxes, and works as a social coordinator at a senior home. 
 That's a job? 
 Okay, Dale Reynolds let his girlfriend die of a heroin overdose. 
 And then someone shot him full of heroin. 
 The question is... 
 Why does a never-married social coordinator get buried alive? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Woman :  It's like something out of a nightmare. 
 Poor Valerie. Who would do something like that? 
 We were hoping you could point us in the right direction. 
 I wish. 
 Mr. Raines. 
 Hmm? 
 We talked about this. 
 Shut it down. 
 (computer beeps) 
 Valerie's adored by the residents. 
 Me, not so much. 
 Does she have an office or a desk or something we can look at? 
 A locker. I'll open it for you. 
 Are you a Mexican? 
 My last husband was a Mexican. 
 Beautiful man. 
 He sounds great, but... 
 Don't believe what anyone says. 
 You know Valerie. 
 She's an angel of death. 
 O-Okay... 
 And she killed Ethel Puckelwitz for her life insurance. 
 Smothered her with a pillow till she couldn't breathe. 
 Mm-mm. 
 You all right? 
 V-Valerie was suffocated, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I think I know who we might be looking for. 
 Good, because I think I know where to look. 
 I found this in Valerie's locker. 
 Church bulletin. 
 Guess which church. 
 Patterson : Valerie Rausch? 
 Yeah, I know her. 
 Well, she was buried alive last night. 
 Do you have any idea why? 
 We're thinking it might have something to do with her nasty habit of smothering senior citizens to get their life insurance. 
 He doesn't look surprised. 
 He doesn't look surprised. 
 If I told you something like that, I'd be surprise... Would you not be... 
 Would you please? 
 I would go, huh? What? 
 Whoa, that's a surprised look. That's what I was going for. 
 Let me guess, Father, Valerie walked into your little magic box and told you all about her unconventional use of orthopedic pillows, and... 
 If such a thing happened, I would have urged her to turn herself in. 
 But she didn't, and someone punished her for it. 
 Just like with Dale Reynolds. 
 What do you want from me? 
 A confession would be nice. 
 You know I was in the sanctuary. 
 Then tell us who it could be. 
 Who else knows what Valerie Rausch and Ben Garvey confessed to you? 
 No one. It was between the confessor and God. 
 (groans) 
 It is so difficult to subpoena God. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All right, let's go turn the confessional upside down. 
 Ooh, that's the surprised look I was hoping for. 
 See that? 
 What are we looking for, anyway? 
 Hell if I know. 
 Kinda underwhelming, isn't it? 
 Hey, uh, I took your keys last night when you weren't looking. 
 I took a bottle of Blue Label this morning from the den. 
 Yeah, well, I knew you were gonna do that, so I switched it with a crappier bottle. 
 The girl from the other night... 
 ...I don't even know her name. 
 I don't really remember anything. 
 I was... I was black-out drunk. 
 Well, that's got to be unsettling. 
 Is this happening a lot? 
 Waking up with unknown girls? 
 Getting blacked-out drunk. 
 More often than I should. 
 Well, that's got to be... 
 Well, I'm sure that wasn't easy for you to say. 
 I think it's important that you did. 
 You know, realizing that this is something you need to look into. 
 And I appreciate... 
 No, I'm  honored  that you would share that with me. 
 Murtaugh : I mean, I know I'm your partner and all, but-- and I don't even care if this is reciprocal or not-- but I consider you a friend. 
 (laughs softly) 
 Yeah, it's true. 
 I mean, you don't... you don't have to say anything, just... just process it.

 Riggs? 
 Riggs! (voice echoes in church) 
 (whispers): Sorry. 
 (door opens, hinges creaking) 
 Oh, right here. Let's see. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Riggs : Bingo. 
 Hey, what you got behind this door right here? 
 A maintenance room-- it's where Reuben keeps supplies for the grounds, for the soup kitchen. 
 The soup guy who had the little tiny crackers? 
 (hinges creak) 
 I'll be damned. 
 Marty. I heard I might find you here. 
 Uh, it's almost never true. Um... 
 We're gonna need the room a few minutes. 
 You know what, I gotta go, too. 
 We've got this vigilante killer... 
 You'll take a minute! 
 For me. 
 We missed you Friday night. 
 Catholic Church gives a grieving spouse a year and a day to mourn a loved one. 
 I-I know you're not a religious man, but... 
 Friday was a year and a day. 
 That's why I picked the date. 
 Anna and I knew this first one was gonna be difficult. 
 But we wanted to mark it, to remember Miranda. 
 With family. 
 With friends. 
 Everyone she loved. 
 You were her husband. 
 I still am. 
 What were you doing Friday night that you couldn't make it? 
 I was in no shape to be around people. 
 From what I've heard, you're in no condition a lot. 
 (exhales) Ronnie, listen... 
 Marty. 
 You want to be a drunk, you be a drunk. 
 But I won't allow you to blame my daughter for it. 
 Murtaugh :  There's a BOLO out  on Reuben Tomar's car. 
 LAX, bus station, train station, all have been alerted. 
 Okay. So, what do we know about him? 
 He grew up in St. Valens Church after losing both parents. 
 Murtaugh : His father was a violent alcoholic. 
 He beat his mother to death. 
 Actually got sent away to prison for it. 
 We have a problem. Father Patterson is M.I.A. 
 Hospital security has his car in the parking lot. 
 Sign of struggle and blood on the seat. 
 Why would Ruben take his priest? 
 Maybe he wanted to repent. 
 Pretty sure that's not how it works. 
 (grunts) 
 Avery :  Okay. Valerie Rausch, Dale Reynolds. 
 Reuben went after them for a reason. Why them? Why now? 
 Ruben found out they got away with murder during confession. 
 So he punished them the same way they committed their crimes. 
 If Father Patterson knew that Reuben's dad was abusing his mom,  he sure as hell would hold him accountable as well. 
 Reuben, stop. 
 God will forgive you. 
 Like you forgave my father. 
 You freed him of sin. 
 Instead of saving my mom. 
 So now, you are going to suffer as she suffered. 
 (leather belt creaking) 
 Dad liked to use belts. 
 Did he tell you that? 
 When he confessed to you? 
 The BOLO paid off. Here's Reuben blowing a red light on Normandie and Sunset about 15 minutes ago. 
 Well, that's just a couple of blocks from his childhood home. 
 The apartment where his mother died. 
 Yep. 
 Go. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Stay with me, Father. 
 Please. 
 No more. 
 I read the coroner's report. 
 He hit her 39 times before she died. 
 I'm only up to ten. 
 My mother could take it. 
 So can you. 
 Childhood home of deranged serial killer? 
 Seems kind of textbook. 
 (whispers): Is that the house? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All right. 
 Patterson : Please, stop! (blows landing) 
 Rueben, please. 
 Clear, left! 
 Clear! 
 Rog? 
 Yeah. (groaning) 
 You got this? 
 I got it. 
 Ambulance on their way. 
 (groaning) 
 Uh-uh-uh. Come on. 
 You need to come with me. 
 I'd rather go with God. 
 Eh, that's not really a good option. 
 You know. 
 Look. 
 I mean, I know it's majestic, and the white dove, and everything, but... 
 Hey, hey, hey, no! 
 (yells) 
 (grunting) 
 Hey! 
 I got you. 
 I'm gonna pull you up. 
 (grunting) 
 (metal groaning) 
 Rog, it's not gonna hold. 
 You're gonna fall, too. 
 (grunting) 
 Rog, it's not gonna hold. 
 Let me go. 
 No! 
 I'm not gonna let you go. (grunting) 
 Rog! Let me go. 
 I'm not letting you go. 
 Rog. It's okay. It's okay. 
 No. I'm not letting you go! 
 Ow! 
 What is wrong... You hit me! 
 Rog! You need to let me go, Rog! 
 I'm not letting you... go! 
 (screams) 
 (both groaning) 
 (moaning) 
 Ow. 
 (exhales) 
 Rog. 
 Tell the truth. 
 Did you know this tree was down here? 
 I can't believe you hit me! 
 Well... 
 Avery : So, I read your report. 
 Have some questions. 
 You shouldn't. Everything's in there. 
 The shiner. Walk me through that. 
 You're on the roof with the suspect. 
 When did he punch you? 
 Suspect did not punch me. 
 Then who... Please, don't say Riggs. 
 Riggs. 
 (clears throat) 
 Do me a favor. If Delgado asks, tell him... 
 Baseball to the face, got hit by space debris, swordfishing accident... 
 Yes. Any of those things. 
 Why did he do it? 
 It's not his fault. 
 I had it coming. 
 I tried to save his life. 
 (sighs) 
 (exhales) 
 Quite the watering hole you got here, Ronnie. 
 Can I buy you another drink? 
 Get another one of these and a club soda. Thanks. 
 You don't have to abstain on my account. 
 It's not just you. 
 I'm starting to forget things about her. 
 Little things. 
 God knows I don't want to, but, um... I am and... I can't do anything about it. 
 So let us help you through it. 
 Look. 
 I really appreciate everything you've done for me. 
 I do. 
 I can't do this. 
 I think it's best If I don't see you guys anymore. 
 Martin. 
 You're our family. 
 No. 
 She was your family. 
 I was just lucky for a little while.

 Hey. 
 It's late. What are you doing? 
 I was just looking for things to do with the money we saved on Princeton. 
 You're torturing yourself, honey. 
 No. I ran the numbers. You know, we could take a cruise around the world in a first class cabin nine times. 
 You like travel. 
 Yes... But it's a boat. 
 I get seasick. 
 Well, there's a deserted town in North Dakota that we could buy. 
 RJ and Feather could move there, and he could be the mayor of Stupidville. 
 (laughs) Stop. 
 Don't drain the college fund just yet. 
 I have faith RJ will make the right choice. 
 Maybe it'll take a few months, maybe a year. 
 Feather just broke up with me. 
 Or sooner. 
 Hey, baby. 
 Aw. 
 What happened? 
 She said she's not in a head-space for a relationship, with everything that's going on in the world. 
 Oh. 
 Mm, mm-mm. 
 So, the WWOOFing is... 
 It's off. 
 Oh. 
 Roger jr. : Now she's going to Greenland to measure glacial melt. 
 By herself. 
 She's so flighty. 
 So flighty. 
 (knocking on door) 
 Maybe it's her. 
 (whispering): Please, don't be her. 
 Oh, please, honey. (laughs) 
 Let it be anybody but her.

 Feather. 
 Ah. 
 Poor guy. Well. I brought you this as a thank you for saving my life, but, uh, maybe RJ needs it more than you do. 
 Hey, look at this. The seal's not even broken. 
 I'm touched. 
 Ah, well. Can I pour you a shot? 
 Oh, no. I'll just have a glass of water. 
 You know, there's no alcohol in water. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, Feather used to tell me that ground water is contaminated by dry cleaners. 
 Murtaugh : Listen. 
 I know you don't want to hear this right now, but you're gonna meet so many Feathers in your life. 
 He's right. 
 And you know where you meet girls just like her? 
 The best, smartest, most interesting women in the world? 
 Rio. 
 College. 
 College. 
 What if I went to college in Rio? 
 Ah! Very good! 
 Ah... 
 Murtaugh :  That's not gonna happen.
