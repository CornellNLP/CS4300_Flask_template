 I'm very familiar with this game. 
 What you don't talk about can't hurt, right? 
 But I'm the one who I.A. is going to ask if you're field ready, so you're gonna have to. 
 I'm an open book. 
 What would you like to discuss? 
 How about your wife? 
 Next question. 
 Okay, but they don't get any easier. 
 Let's try. 
 Do you want to die? 
 Murtaugh : The man wants to die! 
 Which is fine, his business, but if it was up to me, I'd lock him in a padded white room. 
 But that's not my area of expertise. 
 What is my domain is sustaining the life of one Roger Mayfield Murtaugh! 
 (watch beeping rapidly) 
 Calm down. 
 That thing's gonna explode. 
 (beeping stops) 
 I.A. is investigating. 
 But he'll probably be cleared, since the shots were fired from the suspect's weapon. 
 You're not seriously considering putting that man back in the field. 
 It came from upstairs. 
 Someone's protecting this guy. 
 ‭Who?!

 We got a DOA in Griffith Park. 
 Want to give me a ride? 
 I don't really know my way around. 
 Sure, Murtaugh can give you a ride. 
 Is the DOA dead? 
 "Dead on arrival." 
 Does it mean something different here? 
 I just want to make sure there's no one else left for you to kill. 
 Just you and me. 
 Besides, I.A. confiscated my weapon until I'm cleared from the bank, so if we gotta kill somebody, it's on you, big guy.

 Oh. Any relation? 
 I went to film school, wrote a script, so these geniuses all call me Scorcese. 
 Super creative. 
 Well, walk us through it, Herr Director. 
 (Murtaugh chuckles) 
 Scorcese : Name is Ramon Alvarez. 
 Gunshot wound to the right temple, appears self-inflicted. 
 Residue on his right hand consistent with the .22 found by his side. 
 Looks like suicide. 
 He served. ‭Yeah. 
 He was actually a SEAL. 
 '06 through '11. 
 He also has scarring on his wrists. 
 Might not have been his first attempt. 
 Murtaugh : Hmm. 
 Okay. Well, I think we have a pretty clear picture of what happened. 
 I'll go fill out some paperwork. 
 Riggs : How'd he get here? 
 No car, no bike, no bus stop. 
 Maybe he walked. 
 He's got silt on the bottom of his boots. 
 If he'd've walked, it would've come off. 
 There's none of that around here. 
 Maybe he Ubered. 
 Riggs : To kill himself? 
 Come on, seems like a pain in the ass, don't you think? 
 Wouldn't you just go bang at home? 
 I wouldn't know. 
 Lucky you.

 We are very sorry about your loss, Mrs. Alvarez. 
 He didn't do this. 
 Do you understand me? 
 Ma'am, we're exploring all possibilities. 
 That's why we're here. 
 We noticed some scarring on your husband's wrists. 
 That was a long time ago, when he first got home from the war. 
 One day, I came home early from work, and I found him. 
 In the tub. 
 But then everything changed. 
 How so? 
 Mrs. Alvarez  : He found this new job, working security down at the Port of L.A. 
 He was exercising, he stopped taking his anti-anxiety medicine, Klonopin. 
 I think he felt like a soldier again. 
 Mrs. Alvarez, were you guys going somewhere? 
 (sighs) 
 Yeah. 
 Ramon wanted us to start over. 
 He found us a big house in Arizona. 
 When were you leaving? 
 Next week. 
 Thank you for your time, Mrs. Alvarez. 
 Lefty, huh? 
 This your dad's? 
 You guys play? 
 We'd play catch sometimes. 
 Always seemed to make him happy. 
 I certainly understand killing yourself once you've moved to Arizona but seems a little aggressive to do it the week before, no? 
 If you were gonna kill yourself, how would you do it? 
 Hypothetically. 
 Pills seem nice, you know? 
 Drift off, fall asleep. 
 Then, of course, some idiot pumps your stomach, you wake up, you're in the hospital, you gotta go to work the next day, everybody knows about it, that's humiliating. 
 I have heard really nice things about drowning, though, you know? ‭No, no, no. 
 If you were going to shoot yourself, how would you do it? 
 May I? 
 Come on. I'm not gonna do it here, I promise. 
 First, I'd swing by Home Depot. 
 Pick up a nice, polyethylene plastic sheet, lay it out nice and neat so as not to make a mess. 
 Then I'd take my final, last shot of Jonathan Daniel's, leave the instructions for my internment and a nice $6,500 check for burial costs. 
 Actually, things are more expensive out here. 
 I might need to look into that. 
 My point was, you'd use your dominant hand. 
 So why would Alvarez shoot himself with his right hand if he was lefty? 
 Maybe he didn't. 
 Guy wants to get out of town in a week, he's either really excited to get somewhere... 
 Or he's trying to get away from someone. 
 Come on. 
 Where we going? 
 To find out how a guy who works security can afford a big house in Arizona.

 But I suppose it all depends on the life experience you're after. 
 If you want to see your best friend's head get blown off, it's ideal. 
 But if you're just trying to piss off your parents? 
 Hitchhiking through Thailand, that be a little bit better. 
 See, Mom, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Experience. 
 No, stop, we're not talking about that right... 
 Why? 
 What's going on? 
 I don't like being out of the loop. 
 What's happening? 
 I had a teeny bit of weed. 
 What?! 
 And now Mom is losing her sh... 
 No... watch it. 
 ‭stuff. 
 Watch it. Losing her stuff. 
 I'm really impressed with the weed out here. 
 I mean, it's incredible, you know? 
 I mean, as far as I can tell, it's really the only perk to living in California. 
 I had massive, you know, psychological issues. 
 So, of course, I would never, uh, suggest that for a child. 
 What I would suggest, though, maybe your old man take a little hit off the tree. 
 You know what I mean? Little bald-headed Coolio gets loose. 
 (laughter) 
 That's funny, huh? 
 I like being tight. 
 It keeps me alive. 
 Well, we can tell. Yeah. 
 So, Martin... do you have any kids? 
 Uh... no. 
 Um... wasn't really in the cards. 
 You know? 
 Mm. But you're married? 
 Not anymore. 
 Not anymore, no. 
 Murtaugh : Imagine that. 
 Let me guess. 
 You had an affair with your gun. (laughs) 
 Nobody's laughing. 
 She passed away. 
 I'm sorry, Martin. 
 Ah, it's life, right? 
 Never ceases to surprise. 
 (baby crying) 
 It's the baby. 
 I'll get the baby.

 Bite! 
 Bite! 
 (baby laughs) Bite! 
 (squeaking) 
 What are you doing? 
 (growling playfully) 
 Nice family you got. 
 Yeah, they keep us on our toes. 
 And up all night. 
 Yeah, I noticed the slight... 
 The slight age difference, yeah. 
 What do you want? It wasn't part of the plan. 
 Trish was 42. 
 The kids were out. 
 Nine months later, this one comes out. 
 She come... Boom, I'm here! 
 You can't deny me! 
 (laughs) 
 And then I have a heart attack in the delivery room. 
 You were in the right place. 
 Anywhere else, they say I wouldn't have made it. 
 Dada! 
 Dada, dada! 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry about your wife. 
 I didn't know. 
 I know. 
 I just wanted to embarrass you a little. 
 Yeah, well, for the future, I do a pretty good job of that myself. 
 Ain't that right, baby? 
 Hmm, ain't that right, baby? 
 She was a good one. 
 Gave me something to live for, you know? 
 Hey. 
 You ever hold one of these before? 
 Oh, no, I haven't washed my hands in a long time. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Where you going? 
 To get my keys. 
 The case isn't being reassigned till tomorrow. 
 That means we got tonight to solve it. 
 You find anything unusual? 
 A few things. 
 See that? Notes of stippling, or gunpowder around the entry wound suggests the gun wasn't directly against his head when it was fired. 
 Have you ever seen a suicide like that? 
 Nope. 
 Also the tox reports say he had 40 milligrams of Klonopin in his system. 
 Enough to kill him if the bullet didn't get there first. 
 Didn't his wife say he was off of that drug? 
 So someone had to know the meds he was on, so it didn't look like he'd been doped. 
 I'll check his medical records. 
 All right, I'm gonna go talk to his wife. 
 Hey, Riggs? 
 ‭Yeah? 
 You're right. 
 We would've made a terrible team. 
 Oh, yeah. Worst.

 Oscar never came home from school today. 
 I got a call. They said that... they said that they had him. 
 And what, Mrs. Alvarez? 
 If I ever wanted to see him alive again, I would give back what Ramon stole. 
 What did he steal? 
 They said drugs. 
 Heroin. 
 But I've never seen drugs in this house. 
 Ramon never got high. 
 I searched everywhere. 
 But... I don't know where it is.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Murtaugh : Whoa! 
 Easy, kemosabe. 
 I come in peace. 
 Charming place you have here. 
 Thank you. 
 Did you know that your house is illegally parked? 
 So why don't you write me a parking ticket? 
 What's going on here, Riggs? 
 A little weapon spring cleaning. 
 Okay. 
 So we're back to doing that bit where we don't tell each other things, right? 
 Well, I was raised that when you come to someone's house, no matter how disgusting it is, you bring something. 
 Look who I found in Alvarez's military records. 
 Daryl Hennicky. 
 Alvarez's boss from the port. 
 And his commanding officer in Iraq. 
 He said they barely knew one another. 
 Well, I guess he lied. 
 So I'm gonna ask you again, what the hell is going on here, Riggs? 
 Someone kidnapped Alvarez's kid. 
 Told the wife if she doesn't return the heroin that he stole, they're gonna kill the kid. 
 Heroin? 
 Okay, that explains why he was rushing to get out of town. 
 So who has the drugs? 
 Hennicky had to know they were smuggling drugs down at the port. 
 So he hires Alvarez and then he convinces him to steal them. 
 So Hennicky kills Alvarez... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ‭...makes it look like a suicide. 
 Drug dealers think that Alvarez still has their stuff and the cops think he offed himself. 
 Perfect crime. 
 So what's the plan? 
 (inhales) 
 Go down there and talk to 'em. 
 Tell 'em I want the kid back. 
 Okay, then I'm going with you. 
 Uh, no, no, no, no. 
 ‭Yes, yes, yes. 
 (sighs) 
 This is the kind of thing I'd prefer to do alone. 
 You understand? 
 Well... all right, you're the boss. 
 But you can't go running around with that little peashooter that you got there. 
 All right? So you want the 870 or you want the SIG? 
 You gotta pick one of 'em. 
 Hey, hey! 
 Get these damn handcuffs off me.

 Could I help you, officer? 
 Yeah, I'm here for the kid. 
 What kid? 
 Ramon Alvarez's son. 
 Unless you got other kidnapped children here, in which case, I'll take them as well. 
 Look, I get it. You took the kid because you thought that his dad stole your heroin, which he did. 
 Which, I could care less about all of this. 
 My only concern is the 12-year-old boy. 
 So if you let me walk out of here with him, none of this ever happened. 
 Or we can explore option number two. 
 Which is? 
 Ooh. Well, that's the one where I kill as many of you as I can before you take me out and then you up your profile from small-time dealer to cop killer. 
 Then you spend the rest of your life in prison or on the run... most likely, dead. 
 I'm not saying that it's a great option, but people like choices.
