 Bad news for you,  mijo. 
 A dead man can't order you lunch. 
 French fries! 
 No, no, no, we've talked about this. 
 Fries are not a meal. 
 (whines) 
 (phone beeps) 
 Hey, sweetie. 
 I think I left Hunter's floaties in the room. 
 Figure out lunch. 
 (whispering): Hey. Be right back. 
 It's about time. 
 We got a problem. 
 I know. 
 That's why I'm here. 
 Uh, so, what are we doing about it? 
 My son lost his floaties. 
 His what? His floaties for the pool. 
 Every problem has a solution, amigo. 
 For the boy, it's to pack extra floaties. 
 For you... 
 (silenced gunshot whooshes)

 What?

 Hey, what the hell? 
 No, no, all right, I live here. 
 Hey. 
 How'd you get in here? 
 What are you doing? 
 (whimpering) 
 Yeah, we all got problems. 
 Let's go. Up. Come on. 
 Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out. 
 (door closes) 
 All alone. 
 No wife, no kids. 
 Just Daddy and his little girl. 
 One day, your mommy's gonna take you to to visit colleges and that'll be the next time Daddy has the house all to himself. 
 So... when your nanny gets here, Daddy's on a bender. 
 Uh... and if your mama asks, I only had Greek yogurt. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Gudelia, what's up? 
 Yeah, Baby Harper's locked and loaded.

 Did it again, didn't I? 
 Yep. 
 But how about we try to salvage the last five minutes of our session and talk about... 
 I don't know, your sleeping problem? 
 I don't have a sleeping problem. 
 No, not in here you don't. 
 How about at home? 
 Still having those dreams? 
 They're getting worse. 
 Well... depends on how you look at them. 
 Tell me. 
 What do you do... in the dreams? 
 Do you... talk to her? 
 Touch her? 
 Do you have s*x? 
 She talks to me. 
 What does she say? 
 "Join me." 
 Is that what you want? 
 Some days. 
 Just some days? 
 Most days. 
 Every day. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Oh, dead guy downtown. 
 Got to go. 
 Saved by a stiff. 
 You know, you need to get, like, a duvet cover for this thing. 
 You know? Like, some bigger pillows for it.

 I wear shorts one day and they call me unprofessional. 
 Happy Bring Your Daughter to Work Because the Nanny Drank Expired Milk Day. 
 Bender's not off, is it? 
 Hell no. 
 I only get the house to myself once a decade. I need this weekend so I can get through the next weekend. 
 And don't you look terrible. 
 I didn't think you could look any worse. 
 Thanks. 
 Good morning. 
 You got something strapped to the front of you. 
 Or are you just wearing children as, uh, jewelry nowadays? 
 Yeah, it's called work-life balance. 
 I'm leaning in. 
 Can we do some policing, please? 
 Bailey : Victim is male, early 20s, Asian. 
 Bullet wound to the head. 
 No wallet or I.D. 
 We do know he was killed elsewhere. 
 Had his legs broken, stuffed in a suitcase and moved to this location. 
 Murtaugh : So, you think it's gangs? 
 Mm, no, the ink's more hipster than gangster. 
 We've got trace elements of white powder under his fingernails. 
 I'll run some tests. 
 Fashion District is ground zero for drug smugglers. 
 I'm guessing coke. 
 You're right. 
 Why use science when you have guessing? 
 Murtaugh : I've seen this before. 
 This is a message. 
 You don't drop a corpse like this unless you want someone to see it, am I right? 
 And I'm talking to myself again. 
 Hey, Riggs. 
 We have a dead body here, remember? 
 So, you're walking to work and you see caution tape, looky loos, body shoved into a suitcase... and what? 
 You just keep your head down? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hey, Bailey. 
 I got diapers in the car. Take her. 
 Oh... okay. 
 I mean, I don't know. 
 I've never had a baby before. 
 Figure out what's in her diaper. 
 These go here. All right. 
 Thanks, guys. 
 Awesome. I'll just... babysit. 
 Reminds me of maquiladoras across the border. 
 Same sweatshop, different city. 
 This neighborhood is full of them. 
 LAPD. 
 Here to ask you about the guy outside. 
 The one that was, um... 
 (clucks tongue) Suitcase. 
 ...deceased. 
 I'm gonna let you do this. 
 Did you know him? 
 Yes. 
 Can you ask your wife (laughing): if you can give me a name? 
 That's Richie Kim. 
 He grew up with our son, Vince. 
 Richie. Was Richie doing drugs? 
 Was he selling them? 
 No, nothing like that. 
 Is this your son, Vince? 
 I'm gonna need to talk to him. 
 (speaks Korean) 
 What'd she say? 
 That wall... it's still wet. 
 Oh, son of a bitch. 
 Man : It's an illegal search. 
 Riggs : What's an illegal search? 
 I just want to look inside the crate. 
 I said no. 
 Is-is that a no or is that like or a little no? 
 Or, like, is there a little yes in there? 
 You have no warrant. 
 Here's the thing, I had a warrant, but it's in my other pants. I didn't wear those pants today. 
 What are you looking at? 
 Wait... 
 Murtaugh : What's happening, man? 
 You making friends again? 
 Yeah, you know me. 
 So, uh... when I was in El Paso, right, dealers across the border used to try to smuggle their stuff through these stuffed animals. 
 I once found 20 kilos inside of an Elmer Fudd. 
 20 kilos. 
 You'd need a whole truck full of Fudds.

 Lady, lady. 
 No, no, no, don't get up. 
 You might have internal, stop... 
 LAPD! 
 You're interfering with an investigation. 
 Yeah, DEA. 
 And you're interfering with my investigation. 
 Okay, well, that's my suspect. 
 Right. 
 And you're gonna let him go, Detective. 
 (panting): I lost him in the crowd. 
 Who's she? 
 Oh, this? 
 Just the worst driver in the DEA. 
 DEA. 
 So, there were drugs in the bunnies. 
 You two have no idea what you've gotten yourselves into, do you? 
 The answer's usually no. 
 Yeah. 
 Countless hours of wire tapping, Homicide, that's what we do. 
 Data collection, That's our job description. 
 Three years of surveillance all blown to hell, why? 
 Because your guys had a stupid hunch about a couple of pink bunnies? 
 Hey, that's not fair. 
 There was a lot of bunnies. Weren't there? 
 It was a bunny fest. 
 My men had ample reason to believe that someone was smuggling drugs. 
 Oh, okay, yeah. Let's show me the drugs. 
 You know what, hell, let's... (bunny squeaks) cut them all open. Hmm? 
 What are you, a sociopath? 
 She's cutting the heads off of animals. 
 Maybe you could explain to us why the DEA is tracking these bunnies if they don't contain narcotics. 
 I'm sorry, I can't. It's above your clearance. 
 It's gonna be very hard for us to work together if you keep us in the dark. 
 I agree, 100%. 
 Which is why you're backing off. 
 You see how she slipped that in? 
 Slid it right in. 
 I have devoted three years of my life to this. 
 Your guys tripped over it by accident. 
 It wasn't an accident. 
 A man was murdered. 
 All right. 
 I'll fold that into my ongoing investigation, but Captain, no disrespect at all, I cannot have a couple of yahoos and cowboys throwing bombs (both mouthing) into my investigation just to see what they can blow up. 
 Avery : Okay, no disrespect, Agent Palmer, but until I receive a phone call from someone with a chief or director in front of their name, our murder investigation will continue. 
 (Riggs and Murtaugh groan mockingly) 
 (chuckles) 
 (clapping) 
 (Murtaugh laughs) 
 Captain Avery came to play. 
 Now, go catch me a murderer. 
 No sign of drugs, anywhere? 
 It's a DEA case, that's what they do. 
 Didn't say anywhere. Just not under Richie's nails. 
 I did find a joint compound, like for construction. 
 And something else, too. 
 I took some cinematic license with this. 
 Scorsese : The human scalpel, home to more than 10,000 strands of hair... 
 Could you just fast forward? 
 I have a New York strip steak thawing in my kitchen. 
 So Trish is out of town. 
 What does that got to do with anything? 
 If I want to eat steak, I can eat steak. 
 A woman don't tell me if I can have steak or not. 
 Okay, could you just get to the point already? 
 No appreciation for the arts. 
 Flakes on Richie's scalp. 
 Spray back from aerosol paint. 
 I know that paint. 
 That's the kind of paint that could mess up a man's vintage button up, isn't it? 
 I'll have to test it, but yeah. 
 Looks the same to me. 
 Joint compound, paint. 
 I bet Richie built a fake wall at the Hongs' shop. 
 And behind that wall? 
 (claps hands) 
 I think you just found the "D" in DEA. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Murtaugh : We were supposed to come talk to the Hongs and then go home. 
 Even you got to know this is a bad idea. 
 A bad idea? This is a great idea. It was your idea. 
 My idea was to come do it in natural sunlight. 
 With a warrant. 
 A warrant? 
 This was called proactive community policing. 
 All right? Checking in on the small businesses of the city? 
 There's a lot of crime in this neighborhood, so I thought I'd just kick your door down. 
 (alarm blaring) 
 All right, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. 
 (sighs) 
 What's wrong? 
 I'm trying to figure out how exactly to word this in the report. 
 That's your problem! You shouldn't fill out reports. 
 Yeah, I know. You don't. 
 Hey, we got about two minutes before black and whites come. 
 You hear that? 
 (thuds echo) 
 Yep. Hollow. 
 Okay. You know what? We got to find markings or indentations or anything to reveal a w...

 Riggs, What the hell is wrong with you? 
 What? I found the weak spot. 
 What are you do...? Don't-don't you dare. 
 What, don't do what? Don't do... 
 Riggs. 
 Don't do... 
 Riggs, hey, I'm telling you... 
 Riggs : (groans) 
 You had to do it. 
 (grunts) 
 Did you find the drugs? 
 Nope. 
 Then why are you smiling? 
 'Cause we get to wake up Avery. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Avery : Tonight, I am proud to announce the largest cash seizure in LAPD history, over $90 million from suspected drug traffickers. 
 In the spirit of cooperation, we look forward to working with our partners in all relevant federal agencies to track the cash to its source. 
 (reporters clamoring) 
 I was hoping you were just a bad dream. 
 $90 million. No drugs. So, which is it? 
 Juarez or Sinaloa? 
 Just how hard did you hit your head on that drywall? 
 There's what, I don't know, a short list of guys that can move that kind of cash? 
 Cartel being at the top of that list. 
 You want to know what I think? 
 Trick question... if I say no, you're gonna tell me anyway. Captain... 
 The Hongs were peso brokers. 
 Learn that on  Dateline,  did you? 
 What is that? 
 Murtaugh : Oh, it's, like, a news show but if only the news was about guys who kill their wives. 
 Not  Dateline,  peso brokers. 
 Palmer : I'm just here so you can sign over the seized cash. 
 Look, he has humbled himself to say that he doesn't know what it is, at least... 
 I-I can probably look it up. 
 No, hold on. 
 You can at least just explain to him. 
 All right, all right! Fine. 
 Peso brokers, fine! 
 You are the Hongs, you're the Mexican cartel. 
 Wait, hol... I don't want to be... the Mexican cartel. 
 I don't like the casting. 
 A Mexican cartel's drugs are sold all over the west by U.S. dealers. 
 Those dealers then send the money to the Hongs in U.S. dollars. 
 The Hongs use that money to make... bunnies. Which they then ship to... 
 I am a souvenir vendor in Baja. 
 Palmer : The bunnies are sold for pesos which are then sent back to Juarez to make more drugs. 
 So, you were never after the drugs. 
 It's always been about money laundering. 
 Which the Hongs are the key to. Oh, I'm sorry... they were... until you guys scared them off. 
 Except they didn't. 
 See, Detective Cruz dug up some gas station surveillance footage of the Hongs leaving yesterday afternoon, before we found the cash. 
 Right. 
 We have a whole bunch of professionals working on this. 
 You just say the word... 
 I'll make sure you get that seizure order. 
 Cruz : A single grain of sand? 
 It was trapped in a crease before the body was folded. I was texting with my sand guy, hopefully he could tell us where Richie was killed. 
 I don't know. Maybe the beach? 
 "The beach," he says. 
 Which beach? 
 This our man in the suitcase? 
 I had to unpack him. 
 Not pretty. 
 I've seen worse. 
 Really? 
 That was... like, when you were with The Locos? 
 No. That was in class. 
 Forensics. 
 The Academy.

 That was all for you. 
 Well, she probably realizes, you know, I'm the kind of guy that would be drunk in the middle of the day. 
 Come on, man. She couldn't stop smiling at you. 
 You didn't notice? 
 I noticed. 
 And?

 Okay. Something else we don't talk about. 
 We'll just add it to the list.

 Yeah. A very long list. 
 There's Palmer, and she found the Hongs.

 What is wrong with him? 
 The guy's spraying machine gun fire, he just drives right into it. 
 Sometimes he does that. 
 He saved my life. 
 Sometimes he does that, too. 
 Riggs : So never, not once did the cartel contact you or your parents? 
 No. 
 So what is it about me that makes you think I'm stupid? 
 Is it my accent? 
 'Cause see, that's profiling. 
 And it's a little racist. Come on, be honest. 
 Okay, one time, okay? 
 Right after Richie got killed. 
 Somebody called, said keep the shipments going. 
 But I didn't know. 
 I swear to God. 
 Hey, where you been? 
 You had the desk sergeant send me to the wrong floor. 
 That doesn't sound like me. 
 I didn't know we had a desk sergeant. 
 What does he do? 
 How about you step outside, and let me question my suspect? 
 (chuckling) 
 Why don't you step out and let me finish my interrogation? 
 If you want, I-I could step out. 
 Sit down. 
 Sit down. 
 I know you're scared. 
 You're trying to protect your son. 
 He's not a criminal. Kids make mistakes. 
 It's what they do. 
 Sometimes, that's all they do. 
 But our jobs remain the same. 
 They fall down, we help them up. 
 Let me help him. 
 Talk to me. 
 He was doing it for us. 
 Our business was struggling. 
 Richie told Vince he could make easy money. 
 I promise, we had no idea who we were dealing with. 
 I need a contact. 
 Someone directly connected to the cartel. 
 (speaking in Korean) 
 (stuttered breathing) 
 I can keep your family safe. 
 But I'm gonna need a name. 
 
 
 
 Palmer :  If you're trying to go out  in some blaze of glory, do it on somebody else's investigation. 
 All I'm trying to do is help, Palmer. 
 No, there is no helping here, okay? 
 This isn't one of a dozen cases I'm working on. 
 This is it. 
 This is a swamp that I'm draining, so I don't need anybody else... 
 Got a name from the Hongs. 
 See the thing about your swamp? 
 We're already in it. 
 What you got? 
 Bambi Morgenstern. 
 She owns a little shop in Brentwood. 
 She likes to go for long walks on the beach, and being a fashion buyer for the cartel. 
 Hmm. 
 Is she okay? 
 Did I interrupt something? 
 Oh, Agent Palmer? 
 Oh, she was just thanking me for saving her life, and it took a lot out of her. 
 Mm-hmm, yeah. I've been there. 
 Agent Palmer. 
 Would you like our help in picking up Bambi? 
 No. 
 I don't want to pick her up. I want to watch and wait for her to move up the chain. 
 You two can help me with that. 
 Watch and wait. Oh, that's my favorite. 
 Yeah, but it's a perfectly reasonable request. 
 Thank you. 
 Right? 
 Right.

 Because I'm throwing a bender tonight, and my boys would be really crushed if I cancelled. 
 Okay, sure. 
 So first, second, third.

 Nothing.

 Palmer :  Let's get surveillance of Bambi's store up. 
 You take first shift. 
 I mean, you know, look, I'm not trying to step on anybody's toes or anything... 
 You want first shift, you can have first shift. 
 I mean, you know, it's just that I cleared my entire schedule, you know, so, I'm really...

 Look, if you're gonna take first shift, I'm sleeping, unless you want to switch back. 
 No, it's just you, you know... never seen anybody pull out a neck pillow in one of these situations. 
 Well, I'm sleeping in a beach chair, I don't want to wake up with a stiff neck. 
 Have you been on many stakeouts? 
 Uh, yeah, been on a-a quite a few stakeouts, just never ones that have been catered with like... 
 Oh, you know what, it's deli counter pasta and some chicken.

 Please tell me you brought some food. 
 Just relax, your pasta salad is safe.

 I can put a silencer on this thing, maybe. 
 No, no, you know, it's fine, I'm sorry. 
 I'm just having trouble, it's... 
 I'm not used to sleeping with somebody else. 
 Like in a surveillance situation. 
 It's usually a van or a little room. 
 Oh, yeah, no, of course, I get it. 
 Small spaces, you know, easier to sleep when you're alone. 
 You get used to your own breathing. 
 You know, that's really all you kind of need. 
 I thought maybe you'd have, like, some kind of device in there, or maybe a fan... 
 You just keep on talking, Riggs, it's working.

 Don't you want to be surprised? 
 No. No, not after last Christmas. 
 What about this one right over here... how much is that? 
 We actually keep those behind the counter. 
 So if I could just squeeze by you... 
 You know what? First... 
 Oh, goodness! 
 Oh, honey, I just want to thank you. 
 I'm gonna love it! 
 All right, that's enough. 
 No, not quite. I am just the luckiest girl in the whole world, aren't I? 
 He looks a little shell-shocked. 
 (chuckles) 
 Well, he probably just saw the price. 
 (sighs) 
 Gross. 
 You should see his trailer. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, that was some pretty good tap dancing earlier, pretending to be his wife. 
 You like that, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm pretty sure your partner didn't. 
 I haven't seen him since. 
 I think it threw him a little, that's all. 
 The man that goes running into machine gun fire, that's the thing that throws him? 
 Wow. Boy, I'd love to meet the woman that spun his head. 
 She must be something else. 
 Yeah. 
 I heard she was. 
 (bell dings) 
 Cruz? 
 You Bambi? 
 I've been sent to check up on you. 
 Bambi : You've got the wrong person. I don't know you. 
 Cruz : Don't play dumb,  blanquita. 
 You tipped off the cops and helped the Hongs escape. 
 I didn't. 
 Swear to God. 
 I had nothing to do with that. 
 That's good. 
 Keep saying it just like that. 
 He might even believe you. 
 Hi. 
 I need to bring my husband's dry cleaning in. 
 Do you do one-hour turnaround? 
 She's not married. 
 That's a meeting. 
 Caldera : You have the wrong number. 
 This is Valley Hardware. 
 Valley Hardware, got it. 
 Palmer : That's the bug dropping out. 
 Maybe I can reboot it. 
 She found it. 
 No way, she had no idea it was there. 
 All right, then she burned the phone to protect herself. 
 Either way, we're about to lose her. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Can you track this? 
 Yes, but don't... 
 Hey, Riggs, whatever you're thinking of doing, don't do it. We can follow her. 
 She's gonna be looking over her shoulder the entire time. 
 Start tracking this now. 
 What are you doing? 
 She's gonna take me to that meeting. 
 Palmer : He's in a trunk. 
 The man locked himself inside of a trunk. 
 Murtaugh : I wish I could say it was the first time. 
 Give me your keys. 
 Not a chance. 
 You guys have done enough damage to the DEA motor pool. 
 Were you followed? 
 Made sure I wasn't. 
 Are you carrying anything in your trunk? 
 Golf clubs, maybe? 
 No. 
 Slide over, my friend. 
 I'm gonna put a bullet in the right side of the trunk. 
 My right. 
 Now... you're gonna drop your gun, grip first, or the next bullet goes right in the middle. 
 (grunts softly) 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hi. 
 I always get these German cars confused, you know? 
 Can't ever tell which one's mine. 
 (siren chirping) 
 Bullet holes. 
 Ready? 
 They took him. 
 (chains rattling) 
 He's waking up. 
 Man : Good morning, Detective. 
 You have any questions? 
 Hmm? 
 I do have one. 
 The drugs you gave me... does it come in chewable form? 
 Bambi : Wait, I don't like this. 
 This wasn't part of the deal. 
 I sell purses. 
 I'm on the board at the Riviera. 
 This guy's a cop? 
 What happens when people start looking for him? 
 I can't be involved in... 
 (shell casing clatters) 
 Okay. 
 Now, don't be like Bambi here. 
 I ask the questions. 
 Okay? 
 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 Murtaugh : The whole division's on alert. 
 Checkpoints. BOLO on the minivan. 
 Freeway's half a mile away so we're pulling Caltrans feeds. 
 Give me the keys. 
 Absolutely not. I'm driving. 
 Palmer! 
 I said I'm driving. Get in. 
 (muffled shouting) 
 (gasping loudly) 
 Talk to me. 
 Answer my question, Detective. 
 How many do you have? 
 I'm sorry, you're going to have to be more specific. 
 I really just don't know what you're... 
 (burbling) 
 Not yet, amigo. 
 How many do you have? 
 Look, how much longer is this going to take? 
 I have got to be somewhere before... 
 (grunts) 
 (muffled shouts) 
 (grunts) (gasps) 
 Just answer my question and I will let you go. 
 How many do you have? 
 Okay, all right. There's a... there's a ten... okay, then there's a... (mutters quietly) 
 Okay, hold on, four... no, hold on, hold on. 
 42. Wait a minute, no, I didn't carry the one. 
 I need... 
 (muffled shouting) 
 (muffled shouting)

 How many of my operations have been compromised? 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 I don't know.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Join me. 
 (gasps) 
 Not yet. 
 Too easy, huh? 
 Not yet. 
 (quietly): Just kill me. 
 Just kill me. Come on. 
 Most men fight death, but not you. 
 You want it. 
 Hmm? 
 But there are others. 
 Your partner, for instance. 
 Does he have a family? 
 (quietly): Shut up. Stop it. 
 Do they want to die?

 Good news, Detective. 
 I've decided to grant your wish. 
 (clatters) 
 Let's get this over with. 
 Final offer,  guero. 
 You tell me what you know, and I give you what you want. 
 One shot. 
 Think about her. 
 Miranda? 
 Hmm? 
 You say her name again and again. 
 She's waiting for you, Detective. 
 Stop. Down that alley. 
 No, the showroom's on the next block. 
 Stop the damn car. I saw something. 
 Something or someone? 
 I don't know. 
 We're getting one shot at this at best. 
 What did you see? 
 There better be more bullets in that gun. 
 (tires squealing) 
 Last chance. 
 How many of my operations do you have?! 
 Shoot me! 
 How many?! 
 Shoot me!

 Where's Riggs? 
 Riggs! 
 Back, back up! 
 Oh! 
 You want to back...? 
 (grunts) 
 Hey, Rog. 
 Hey, you don't have to worry about it, pal. 
 She ran over me. 
 I got it. 
 You should never operate a vehicle again. 
 Well, you were in the middle of the road. 
 That's right, I was in the middle of the road, and you guys have headlights and streetlights and the moon's out. 
 Could be you're just one of those guys people like to hit with cars. 
 (chuckles) 
 (groans) 
 (sighs) 
 (footsteps approaching) 
 (Riggs clears his throat) 
 Thought you'd be home by now. 
 A detective goes missing in the field, I go to flex-hours. 
 Trauma never sleeps, huh? 
 Well, I never got that duvet, but... 
 Oh, no, if I lay down, I won't get back up. 
 I saw her again. 
 She almost had me. 
 But not quite. 
 Not quite. 
 Well, I, for one, am really glad you're here.

 Hey. 
 Caldera's not talking. 
 Least we got him for the murder. 
 I see the paramedics released you. 
 Eh, well, I told 'em that my only permanent injury was my ability to do paperwork and they let me go. 
 Right. Where's Murtaugh? 
 Sent him home. 
 He's got seven more hours of alone time before everyone returns, so didn't want to hear about the bender that never was. 
 Right. 
 Well, it has been an experience working with you.
