 ("The Look of Love" playing) 
 Nina Simone? (laughs) 
 Only because someone moved my Sly and the Family Stone. 
 And I got much better things to do than go digging for it. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We do have the house to ourselves. 
 Baby's down. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 RJ's at model U.N. 
 Riana's at Amanda's house. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ♪ The look of love ♪ 
 Bethany's. She told me Bethany's. 
 She told me Amanda. 
 It doesn't matter.I  can't tell them apart anyway. 
 (laughs) 
 ♪ More than these words could ever say ♪ 
 No, no. 
 Don't feel right. 
 Doesn't feel right. 
 (crickets chirping) 
 (chuckles) Hey. 
 Um, I-I thought you'd be asleep. 
 Nope. Not asleep. 
 Actually, wide awake. 
 Wondering where you were. 
 What? I-I thought I told you. 
 Oh, you did. But when I called Amanda, she said you'd just left. 
 And Bethany said the exact same thing. 
 So is there something you want to tell us? 
 You called my friends? 
 Yes, we called your friends... 
 Wait, how do you even know their numbers? 
 Did you go through my phone? 
 That is such a breach of trust. 
 That's not the point... 
 Oh, what's next? 
 You gonna use one of those find my phone apps? 
 Track me like I'm some kind of criminal? 
 (sighs) 
 Oh, my God. 
 Trish : We track you because we love you! 
 It's your mother's idea. 
 No, hey, hey. 
 Oh, my God. You know what? 
 I can't talk to you guys right now. 
 It's just so disappointing. 
 (footsteps) 
 What did she just do? 
 (door closes) 
 Riggs :  I-I mean, they served it soggy, you know? 
 I mean, the cheese was all wrong... Hey, look. 
 The key to a perfect chicken parm is the crust. Right? 
 If you don't have good edges... 
 I'm-I'm sorry. 
 Am I, Am I boring you? 
 'Cause I really feel like I'm opening up here, and I'm not getting a whole lot back. 
 A-About an overcooked chicken parm? 
 Yes, yes. Real progress. 
 All right. I didn't say it was overcooked... 
 I said it was soggy. 
 See, don't you think, maybe, this is, like... 
 I don't know, has some deeper meaning, like, there's a parallel between chicken parm, maybe, like, my father. Maybe there's some... 
 How long? 
 'Cause you haven't slept. 
 Fresh flowers, and this is not your standard greenery. 
 No, these flowers come with a note. 
 You have a boyfriend. 
 Looks like we are out of time. 
 Aw, come on, Doc. 
 All right. (grunts) 
 So, does, uh... everyone in the department have to come see you at least once? 
 No. Why? 
 Oh, no reason. 
 Uh, is there another R.M. Murtaugh here with the, uh...? 
 You're unbelievable. Did you really just...? 
 You got to tell me what that's about. 
 All right? Just give me just a hint. 
 In what world would I ever? 
 Look. He's my partner. 
 You have a nice day. 
 All right. 
 Just one more thing. 
 Is his file bigger than mine? 
 Riggs, you have your own drawer! 
 Man : We're all set, let's go. 
 Woman : Steady. 
 Man : Watch your footing. 
 Here we go. 
 Watch it. 
 Hit it right there. 
 All right. 
 Woman : Set it down. 
 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 Roger. 
 What's this? 
 I just want you to know, that I know. 
 You know what, Riggs? 
 That you went to go see Cahill as a patient, and I think that's great, and I just want you to feel free to tell me anything. 
 She told you that? 
 Well, yeah. You know. 
 She thought that it'd be healthy for, you know, for you, for us, if I know all of your... you know. 
 Nope. 
 She didn't tell you squat. 
 No, she didn't.I  saw your name on a file, but I do think it is healthy for us to discuss all of your issues. 
 So, Roger, feel free to unburden yourself. 
 Bailey. 
 Tell me something, please. 
 Hey, guys. This is my trainee, Montero. 
 Okay. 
 So Bailey got herself a Bailey. 
 Um... (clears throat) 
 Uh... 
 (clears throat) 
 We're working on his public speaking. 
 Uh, a homeowner saw the motorcycle parked here all day. 
 Um, he said that, uh... 
 He checked it out and found the body in the ravine. 
 The injuries indicate that he was hit by a vehicle. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Nice work, Montero. 
 There's a camera here on the helmet. 
 If we're lucky enough, we'll find something. 
 As of now, no I.D., no anything. 
 If memory serves me correctly, this is a Yamaha R1. 
 Comes fully equipped with GPS, so maybe you want to download the... 
 Last address entered? 18296 Karen Drive. 
 Issuing orders to an individual who has already executed said orders. 
 Is this your issue, Rog? 
 You will never find out. 
 Challenge accepted. 
 (tires screech) 
 (cement shatters) 
 (dog barking in distance) 
 If anybody asks, it was like that when we got here. 
 Be cool, Riggs. 
 This a house in the Hills. 
 You get hostile towards people of this class. 
 Oh... you feel inadequate seeing a house that's fancier than yours. 
 (clicks tongue) Okay. 
 Are you tired of this yet? 
 (doorbell rings) 
 What, this? 
 Yeah, this. 
 No, no, no. 
 Okay. 
 Not for a while. 
 (whistling) 
 Riggs broke your planter. 
 Y-You said Hawkings. 
 Uh, Hawkings, right? 
 Sean. Sean  Hawkins. 
 And he was your, uh, boyfriend? 
 Or, um... 
 We'd been, um, dating for about a month. 
 Look. If you want us to come back another time, you know, if you need to call someone, we can do this later. 
 No, it's fine. It's fine. 
 I, um... 
 I just, I can't believe he's dead. I... 
 (inhales) 
 (exhales) It wasn't an accident. 
 You think someone killed him. 
 Yep. 
 That's what it looks like. 
 (sighs) 
 You know the drill. Um... 
 Is there anything you can tell us that might help us? 
 Like what? 
 Like, who was this guy? 
 You mean was I dating the kind of man someone would want to kill? 
 No. I... That's... That's not... 
 No. I didn't mean... what he meant, I don't think. 
 That's not how I meant it. 
 I'm sorry, I know you're both just... you're just doing your jobs. 
 It's okay. 
 (sniffles) 
 Uh... he was a s... a surfer. 
 (sniffles) That's how we met. 
 Uh, he was in banking, and then he moved to part-time so he could spend more time at the beach. 
 He, um, he had a kid sister. 
 He was a very sweet guy. 
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.I  wish I knew more. 
 I... (sniffles) 
 Uh, that's fine. 
 Yeah. We... You know what? 
 We're gonna just head in, and get started. 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry for your... loss. 
 If there's anything you need, just please, um... 
 Riggs. 
 Leave the tissues. 
 Okay. 
 Yep. 
 Okay. 
 Avery :  How is she? 
 You know the doc. Hard to read. 
 A quiet wreck. 
 She's a little upside down right now. 
 Well, I told her to take the day off. 
 In the meantime, where are we with this case? 
 Oh, looks like I'm not the only one who disobeys orders around here. 
 Maureen, you know you don't need to be here. 
 I have patients later. 
 Well, on behalf of the craziest of your patients, let me just say, if you want to take the day off... 
 I don't. I want to help. 
 Bailey : Hey, guys. 
 I was able to find some of the... 
 You know what?I 'll just come back later. 
 What do you have? 
 The helmet cam footage. 
 It's a little choppy, and at the end it gets a little... 
 Please, just play it. 
 (beeps, engine revving) 
 (Murtaugh grunts) 
 (tires screeching) 
 Doc, you don't have to do this. 
 Yes, I do. 
 (vehicle approaching) 
 I saw a plate. 
 Play that back. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 Murtaugh : Zoom in on that. 
 Okay. Enhance that. 
 Avery : Let's find out who that truck is registered to and get a BOLO on that license plate right away. 
 Hey, watch your door. 
 Don't want to cause any more property damage. 
 There it is. 
 Busted headlight. 
 Engine's still warm, Riggs. 
 Are you asking permission now? 
 I was wondering it maybe you would like to kick the door in. 
 I don't want to kick the door in. 
 Let me check the door. 
 (door creaking) 
 Clear. 
 Clear. 
 Murtaugh : Our guy's into photography? 
 Crap. 
 What, it's not our guy? 
 Sean Hawkins wasn't the target. 
 There's dozens of pictures on that camera. 
 This creep has been watching her for weeks now. 
 I'm bringing in all available resources... threat-management unit, dedicated forensics team... 
 We're gonna need to look at her patients, too. 
 Already into it. We brought in what's called a "Special Master." 
 You made that up. That's a real thing? 
 It's a real thing. 
 An outside shrink who can review her patients on our behalf while protecting their privacy. 
 An outside shrink looking at Cahill's files? 
 Is she gonna be okay with that? 
 She's worked with him before. 
 I'd say she's okay... ish. 
 What the hell is he doing in my office? 
 Maureen, I know that this must be disruptive to you. 
 Ronald, you have no idea how disruptive this is. 
 Let's all try and play nice. 
 I have police at my house, everyone around here is looking at me sideways, and now he is invading my space. 
 Maureen, there is no scenario in which you can review your own patient files to determine who is and who is not a suspect. 
 We need Dr. Levinson here. 
 I am just trying to help. 
 Who are we looking for? 
 Uh, well, based on the photographs, someone who's intrusive. 
 And the flowers, an unwanted gift, demonstrate that they want your attention. 
 You've deduced I have a stalker. Wow. 
 Maureen, you're a great psychiatrist. 
 No one is questioning that. 
 But the-the procedure in these types of situations... 
 You know what, just... just get on with it. 
 Well, I've already found a former patient that I think is a viable suspect. 
 You already have someone? 
 Yes, an ex-con named Kevin Flynn. 
 It's not him. 
 Dr. Cahill treated him in a prisoner-release program. 
 You know, you were always a little too quick to give your diagnosis. 
 Avery : What is it about Kevin Flynn that makes you think he might fit the bill here? 
 Well, I guess it's how he threatened to kill her. 
 One time. 
 After Dr. Cahill recommended to deny his parole, he lunged across the courtroom, and he shouted, "I will gut you like a fish." 
 It still isn't him. 
 Okay, well, I'm gonna have Riggs and Murtaugh look into it, just to be sure. 
 They're gonna need backup. 
 Riggs and Murtaugh? 
 I'll float that by them. 
 (mouths words) 
 (knocking) 
 Are you Kevin Flynn? 
 Yeah, what the hell do you want? 
 Um... Is there maybe another Kevin Flynn inside there? 
 Like, a bigger one or something? 
 Or is Snow White around? 
 Look, uh, we are LAPD, and we want to ask you some questions. 
 Sure, yeah, come on in. 
 It's not like it's America or anything. 
 Murtaugh : Have you had any contact with Dr. Maureen Cahill lately? 
 Dr. Cahill? (laughs) 
 Uh, no. Well, maybe. 
 Uh, does leaving a message every week telling her I hate her damn guts and I want her dead count as contact? 
 You guys work with her. Leave her a message for me. 
 Die a slow, miserable death, and then rot in hell, bitch! 
 Okay, I think we're all done here. 
 All right, Tweedle Dee, give me your hand... 
 Hey, stop it, stop it, quit. 
 Stop! Stop! No! Quit! 
 (gasping) 
 I'm gonna kill you! 
 Ow! Quit it! 
 ♪ I came to win, battle me that's a sin ♪ 
 (grunts) 
 Ow! 
 ♪ Try and play the role... ♪ 
 (Flynn yells wildly) 
 ♪ Stand up, come on, throw your hands up ♪ 
♪ If you got the feeling, jump up touch the ceiling ♪ 
 Riggs : He's the Tasmanian Devil! 
 Come on, come on, come on! 
 Okay, so I think it's safe to say we got the right guy. 
 (gasps) 
 One, two, three, go. 
 ♪ Jump around, jump around ♪ 
♪ Jump up, jump up and get down ♪ 
 Flynn : Get off me! 
 Get off me! 
 ♪ Jump, jump, jump, jump ♪ 
 Flynn : I hope you rot in hell. 
 Little help, Rog? 
 Get off me! 
 I'm gonna kill you! 
 She ruined my life. 
 I spent a year in jail 'cause of her. 
 You want to act like an animal? 
 Then I will treat you like an animal. 
 Stupid cops! 
 Nine seconds. 
 That's a personal best. 
 Murtaugh :  Kevin,  you have no alibi for Monday morning. 
 Admit that you ran Sean Hawkins off the road, and we'll send you back to the nice little prison that I think you want to be in. 
 Flynn : Lawyer.I  told you, he didn't do it. 
 The fact that he assaulted two detectives says otherwise. 
 Guy's as guilty as it gets. 
 What's she doing? 
 I don't know. 
 Hey, Kevin. 
 So... 
 I got your messages. 
 I haven't been able to get back to you. 
 But you know I won't. 
 Right? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Saving us all some time. 
 Did you kill a man on Monday morning? 
 I'm gonna kill you once I... 
 No, you're not. 
 You're a paranoid-aggressive, and you threaten... that's your thing. 
 So where were you Monday morning? 
 I don't have to tell you. 
 No, but you want to. 
 You don't want to go back to prison, because then who would take care of Nana? 
 Is that what you don't want to admit? 
 You were with Nana on Monday, weren't you? 
 She needs me. 
 You don't understand. 
 I understand. 
 We'll check with the floor nurse. 
 I'm sure she'll vouch for you. 
 I told you, he's not guilty. 
 You were right, but we still have to do our job. 
 Where are you going? 
 Home. 
 We still have to make sure your home is secure... Maureen! 
 I got her. 
 (sighs) 
 Huh. 
 That was a long, silent car ride. 
 Now I know how Murtaugh feels. 
 Look, I can find this guy. 
 But you've got to trust me, and you've got to tell me what you know. 
 What is it you think I'm not telling you? 
 I don't know, because you're not telling me anything. 
 Welcome to my world, Riggs. 
 Thank you for the ride. 
 Stay in the car. 
 Lock the doors. 
 (footsteps) 
 (groaning) 
 Please. Please don't hurt me! 
 What are you doing here? 
 What am I...? 
 This is my house. 
 What? 
 Oh, God... 
 Maureen, what the hell?! 
 You know this guy? 
 It's my husband. 
 Hit him again. 
 (whimpers) 
 
 
 
 How did you get in?  
 I have keys is how I got in. 
 Yes, and I want them back. 
 So leave the keys and go. 
 It's my house. 
 Only because you haven't signed the damn papers, Brad. 
 So why today, Bradley? 
 Why today did you decide, "I'm just gonna pop in on my ex-wife and scare the hell out of her"? 
 I wasn't trying to scare anyone. 
 I was worried. 
 I heard from the neighbors that the police were here. 
 Now I find out you have a stalker, and someone was attacked. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, someone was killed. 
 Where were you yesterday morning, Bradley? 
 You think I... (laughs) 
 Are you serious? 
 Usually not so much, but right now, yeah. 
 At work. You can call my boss. 
 So who was he? 
 The guy who was killed. 
 Were you dating him? 
 (scoffs) Oh, I don't believe this. 
 Y-You're not worried I have a stalker. 
 You're worried I'm dating? 
 Leave. 
 I'm here because I care. 
 Look, I get it, Maureen. 
 You're still angry about Vegas. 
 It was one night. 
 It was more than one night. 
 You know what? 
 You both need to leave now. 
 Let's go. 
 And if he turns around, you have my permission to shoot him. 
 Wow, she almost never gives me permission to do that, Bradley. 
 Oh... 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm just... putting, uh Riana's clothes away. 
 In her desk drawer? 
 Are you searching her room? 
 It's against everything I stand for, but yes. 
 Okay, in that case, what'd you find? 
 She has a license? 
 I don't remember teaching that girl how to drive, do you? 
 No, I do not. 
 However, I do recall her being born in this century. 
 Look at this... 1995? 
 Ninety fi... she is in a world of... 
 (door closes) 
 Riana : Mom? Dad? I'm home. 
 Roger... 
 What? We in the clo... 
 Shh. 
 Mom? 
 That's twice in one day. 
 Oh, my gosh, what are we doing, Roger? 
 Is this our low point as parents? 
 I think it just got lower. 
 What are you doing in my closet? 
 Honey, uh, your father and I... look, we've been worried about you. 
 And we were wondering, is there anything that you want to say...? 
 What is this? 
 I'll tell you what is is. 
 It's a fake I.D. Why do you have this? 
 I got a job. 
 I've been working for some DJs who helped me book some small gigs, but I need the I.D. to get into the clubs. 
 A job? 
 Why didn't you tell us? 
 Maybe I thought you guys would freak out, interrogate my friends, ransack my closet. 
 Do you mind getting out my room? 
 Okay. 
 We'll be... The door is over there. 
 Okay. 
 Love you. 
 All righty. 
 Oh, you're gonna walk us out. 
 Yeah. 
 Riana : Yes, thank you. 
 All right. Mm-hmm. 
 Okay. 
 So, uh... 
 Murtaugh (chuckling) :  Cahill is married? 
 Yep. A real live husband. 
 Just sitting at the house waiting on her. 
 That's super creepy. 
 Top of the suspect list creepy. 
 Murtaugh : Cahill's married. 
 Hey, how you doing there, Other-Doc? 
 Hey. 
 What you got? 
 Well, a lot more now. 
 I just finished your file. 
 Well, I mean, she makes all that stuff up. 
 I'm pretty sure. 
 So, uh, you've known the doctor for a while. 
 You know her on a personal level. 
 Do you know anything about her ex-husband? 
 Brad? 
 Brad. 
 Well, I went to their wedding. 
 He kept dancing with all the bridesmaids. 
 I couldn't see him as a spouse. 
 Can you see him as a stalker? 
 Interesting. 
 L-Let's ponder that when I get back, huh? 
 And you're Murtaugh, right? 
 R.M. Murtaugh? 
 Roger Mayfield. Yeah, why? 
 Yeah, no reason. 
 You see the way he looked me? 
 He read my file. That's what that was. 
 Everybody knows what's in that file. 
 I feel left out. 
 No, no. What... what are you doing, Riggs? 
 Listen, there's a wealth of information inside here. 
 Outside of your file, with potential suspects. I... 
 What are you doing? 
 Uh, we are just... Not breaking and entering. 
 We were running, uh, an inspection. 
 Yes. 
 Yeah. Like a field test, on the door, to see how secure it was. 
 (knocks) It secure? 
 (phone buzzes) 
 (groans) 
 It feels good. 
 Yep? 
 Yeah, looks good. 
 Brad? 
 Maureen, where are you? 
 What are you talking about? 
 You texted me to meet you outside City Hall at noon. 
 Are you blowing me off? 
 Brad's across the street. 
 He said I asked to meet him for lunch, but I never reached out to him. 
 Tell him we're on our way. 
 (horns honking) 
 Cahill : He's in front of City Hall! 
 Rog, stay with her. 
 (horn blaring) 
 (grunts) 
 Hey! 
 (horn blaring) 
 Ah! 
 Hey, whoa, whoa! 
 (grunts) 
 Hey! 
 (air hissing) 
 (screeching) 
 (air hisses) 
 Woman : Did you see that?! 
 Man : Hey, hey! He's got a gun! 
 (crowd clamoring) 
 Hey, there, Bradley. 
 If I was you, I'd sign those divorce papers. 
 Either he's not our guy, or he threw himself in front of a moving truck to convince us that he's not our guy. 
 Consider me convinced. 
 Any luck with security cameras? 
 Not so much. 
 Whoever pushed Brad has his back to the only camera that spotted him. 
 Do we have anything on this? 
 Bailey's gonna hit you up to expense a DNA test. 
 DNA from what? 
 For the saliva used to seal the envelope that came with the flowers delivered to Cahill. 
 Well, good, I was worried it was a long shot. 
 What about Dr. Cahill? 
 As difficult as it is for her to accept, she needs to have a protective detail. 
 We got our eye on her. 
 (can sprays) 
 Sir? 
 The, uh, lady inside asked if you'd come in and join her. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 They brought that by mistake. 
 I couldn't let it go to waste. 
 That is a good looking chicken parm. 
 I mean, the edges are...I  mean, they're perfect. 
 It's my burden. 
 I am professionally obligated to listen to everything you say. 
 Nice place. 
 You come here a lot? 
 Special occasions. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 So what's this one? 
 That your ex escaped a date with a truck? 
 Or were you rooting for the truck? 
 No. 
 Mostly no. 
 He cheated on me. 
 More than once. 
 I kind of put that together. 
 And he lied about it. 
 So well, in fact, that it made me crazy. 
 But that part goes away when you learn the truth. 
 What doesn't go away is how you start looking at everyone like you're just waiting for them to hurt you. 
 Took me a while to get out of that head space, before I could even think about dating. 
 And Sean was the first. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hardest thing in the world is to trust other people. 
 Yeah. 
 ♪ If I held your hand... ♪ 
 Pretend you're interested. 
 (stammers) I'm interested. 
 Um, as far as... 
 No, no, no. Not for me. 
 Um, we're at my favorite restaurant, having what looks like a romantic meal and if he's watching... 
 Then you're trying to make him jealous. 
 My ex-husband, man I was dating, he's obsessively going after people he sees as competition. 
 So you're using me as bait, in hopes that he tries to kill me. 
 I couldn't think of anyone better. 
 Oh, Doc. 
 You are listening, aren't you? 
 (camera snapping) 
 (Riggs grunts) 
 Kick his ass. 
 Oh, and, um, tell Murtaugh to get out of my neighbor's driveway. 
 With any luck, you'll need the help, not me. 
 Hey, Rog. Doc made you. 
 Well, who wouldn't stand out in this ridiculous truck? 
 (Riggs chuckles) 
 Don't worry.I  got my eye on her. 
 Happy hunting. 
 How is she? 
 She's fine. 
 She's eating ice cream. 
 I wish I had some ice cream. 
 Hey, how was that chicken parm? 
 If it was my last meal, I'd die a happy man. 
 You know what else would help me die a happy man? 
 Tell me why you went to Cahill's. 
 Come on, Rog, don't send me to the grave not knowing. 
 Three years ago, Avery and I raided a meth house in East L.A. 
 We grabbed two gangbangers. 
 There was a third one hiding in a closet. 
 He had Avery dead to rights, gun to his head. 
 And I had him dead to rights. 
 Avery gave me the signal, and, uh...  Ifroze. 
 What signal? 
 We had a signal. 
 Two taps on the shoulder meant shoot the guy if he has a gun on you. 
 Why don't we have a signal? 
 (laughs) Because you always shoot the guy. 
 We'd need a signal to say, "Hey, don't shoot the guy." 
 Anyway, I couldn't do it. 
 (engine revving) 
 I was afraid I was gonna hit Avery. 
 I froze up. 
 Avery finally talked the guy down, but, um... well, this one had collateral damage. 
 It bled into other areas of my life. 
 Intimate areas of my life. 
 With Trish. 
 Wow. 
 I'm sorry, man. 
 (chuckles) That you asked? 
 No, uh, you know... that it bled. 
 That's why I went to see Cahill. 
 Happy ending... it all worked out. 
 Nine months later, bam, Harper. 
 (phone buzzing) 
 Hold on second, I got another call. 
 It's Bailey. 
 Hey, what's up, Bailey? 
 That long shot DNA test, not such a long shot. 
 I got a match. 
 Who? 
 Dr. Levinson. 
 Ron? 
 Hey, I'm two minutes out. Maybe less. What do you see? 
 Make it less.  He's in the house. 
 No one told me you were coming. 
 Well, someone from the department called me, and told me to meet you here, bring the files. 
 Really? Who? 
 I don't remember. 
 Is that important?I  came all the way here to see you. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hello? 
 It's Dr. Levinson. 
 Walk out of that house right now. 
 We have a positive DNA match. 
 It's him. Now, go. 
 Tuesday. Yeah, uh, absolutely.I 'll just, I'll just move some things around. Sure. 
 Hey, who... where-where are you going? 
 Um, I-I don't get good service here, so I'm just gonna go outside. 
 No, no, Maureen, I-I can't let you go. 
 The stalker could be out there. 
 Ron, get out of my way. 
 Maureen, I'm trying to protect you. 
 (gunshot) 
 Shots fired! 
 Levinson is down. 
 You got eyes on Cahill? 
 She's still in there  with... Montero? 
 Are you all right, ma'am? 
 (heavy breathing) 
 What's going on? 
 I... 
 I worked with him. I can't believe he... 
 It's all okay. 
 I'm here to protect you, Dr. Cahill. 
 I know you. 
 I was hoping you would. 
 It's been a long time since we were together. 
 "Together"? 
 (tires screech) 
 You were a patient. 
 I treated you months ago. 
 And now I'm here... just in time. 
 How we doing here, guys? 
 You okay? 
 No. No, not even close. 
 (gas hissing) 
 Officer Montero. 
 Right? 
 Yeah. 
 Now, you had the, um, public speaking thing, right? 
 So, look, we're gonna walk out of here. 
 She's not going anywhere. 
 Just lower your gun. 
 I'm prepared to die for her. 
 Are you? 
 'Cause this house is filling up with propane right now. 
 One shot, we light up the canyon. 
 It's Jason, right? 
 You came to see me your first month on the job right after your wife left. 
 You saved my life back then. 
 (gas hissing) 
 Cahill : You don't have to do this, Jason. 
 You can walk out of here. You have a choice. 
 You told me to keep showing up, to do the job, that it would get better, and that no matter what you would be there for me! 
 Oh, you-you probably misinterpreted that. 
 You know, um... 
 You're not good enough for her. She deserves better. 
 Obviously. That goes without saying. 
 But that's neither here nor there. 
 What we need to focus on is getting that weapon into that holster. 
 Or we're gonna have a problem. 
 We're gonna have a problem. 
 Riggs. 
 (grunts) 
 I changed my mind. 
 Brad can keep the house. 
 Yeah. 
 So, he planted DNA with Levinson's chewing gum? 
 He knew we were getting close, so he had to find someone to frame. 
 And then he wanted out like he was Cahill's savior. 
 Dude had a real hero complex. 
 Well, we all know who the real hero is. 
 Oh, me? 
 Mm, right here. 
 You? 
 Did you talk to Cahill? 
 About what? 
 She didn't say. 
 No. 
 How's she doing? 
 Hard to tell. 
 You know Cahill. I told her to take some time off, but... 
 Too many crazies to fix? 
 Now, I just wanted to point out a first in your partnership. 
 You didn't take the shot... but he did. 
 Yes, he did. 
 Yes, he did. 
 That shrink paid for itself. 
 Who do you think told him to go? 
 Was one hell of a shot, Rog. No hesitation. 
 Nope. 
 Shot him right through the hand. 
 Sure did. 
 Were you aiming for his hand, Rog? 
 Shot him right through the hand. 
 Need a hand? 
 Nice try. 
 Just because you saved my life does not entitle you to read my files. 
 You guys and your rules. 
 (groans) 
 So, what's up? 
 Speaking of rules...  Ihave to refer you to a different therapist. 
 It's protocol after something like this. 
 No explanation needed. 
 You know how grateful I am to you? 
 What you did... there is no way that I could put that into words... which that's exactly the problem. 
 Unresolved sexual tension. 
 Murtaugh's dealing with similar issues, so... 
 No. 
 But the dynamic of our relationship, it... 
 You know, the issues that we're dealing with, the impulsivity, the lack of judgment, these are all the reasons I'm alive today. 
 I don't know how much I can help you, Riggs. 
 But you still need help.

 Hey, baby, you sure this is how you want to spend our date night? 
 I mean, I know some people think that hanging out with people half their age makes them feel younger, but I hate people half my age. 
 (laughing): Honey. Look. 
 (laughs) 
 Murtaugh : Wow. 
 I haven't seen her work that hard since I gave her $50 to clean out the garage. 
 You gave her 20, honey. 
 Felt like 50. 
 (laughing): No, it was 20. 
 Okay. 
 I just thought we could both see her in her element and decide if this is something we want to support.

 Riggs, what are you doing? 
 Oh, me? 
 Just getting ready to, uh, jump. 
 You know, because I'm crazy.I 'm unstable. 
 Riggs. 
 What? It's your fault. 
 All right? You want to send me to this new shrink. 
 I go in there, 20 minutes later, they've done undone all that you done done for me. 
 Right? So then I'm broken, like the planter, which I planned on fixing, by the way. 
 Okay, this-this is... this is not funny, okay? 
 So, you come on down from there. 
 No, it's not funny, but maybe you should talk to the shrink that you made me to go who screwed me up, and I walked out of there, and I just wanted to get high, and I'm not talking about like this kind of high, like, you know, I mean, like up on, you know, like a balcony or rooftop or something and just... 
 Is this about our sessions ending? 
 I don't know. 
 You're the doctor. 
 O-O-Okay. 
 Okay, w-wait. What if, what if I said that-that we could continue our sessions?

 Eh... I've been called worse. 
 I'll keep treating you, okay? 
 But... get down.

 Promise? 
 All right, stop. Stop. Stop.
