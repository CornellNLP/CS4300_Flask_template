 N... Uh, sink fight. 
 But you should see the sink. 
 Actually, that's not true. The sink's fine. 
 I'm listening. 
 Uh... 
 Ring went down the drain, got caught in the garbage disposal. 
 I went to get it, but I got it, so... 
 Well, what if you had lost it? 
 I would have torn my trailer apart looking for it. 
 But hypothetically... if you did lose it, what would happen? 
 I'd be unhappy. 
 Very unhappy. 
 Can't imagine that's some kind of big psychological shocker. 
 No. No, it's not. 
 But maybe losing that ring would be a shock for you in a... in a good way. 
 You suggestin' I forget about Miranda? 
 Never. 
 Good. 
 But forgetting about someone is not the same thing as moving on, as evolving, and I think you should allow for the possibility... 
 All right. As usual, this has been a blast. Thanks, though. 
 This has been real helpful.

 His first car should have 100,000 miles on it and be missing at least two hubcaps. 
 He needs a hooptie. 
 It's a rite of passage. 
 I can take the money and keep riding Uber if it'll stop you guys from arguing about it.

 Honey, what's wrong? 
 Nothing. Nothing. 
 Nothing?! 
 That didn't look like nothing. 
 (sighs) 
 Roger? I'm fine. 
 It didn't look fine. You need to sit down. 
 I'm fine. It's just heartburn from these fake meat products. 
 I mean, the idea that there's something wrong with bacon... 
 The idea? 
 You mean, medical research?

 People are stealing cars from the police lot? 
 Audacious, I'll tell you that. 
 The security didn't get a good look at the guy. 
 Just saw a person with a baseball cap and a hoodie over it. 
 Cameras didn't catch anything, either. 
 Now this is a hooptie. 
 Perfect for RJ, but one thing this job teaches you is that you can't judge a book by its cover. 
 Riggs : Hey, Rog, you might not want to go with the blow-in-the-door trim. 
 It's a killer on insurance. 
 Hey. 
 Take this car and all the evidence to the lab. 
 Dust it for prints. 
 (siren blaring in distance) 
 (whirring) 
 There's a little blood. 
 A whole lot of dirt and bird crap. 
 That gonna be a problem for you, Scorsese? 
 Scorsese : DNA is easy. 
 Writing, on the other hand... 
 Murtaugh : Hey. 
 Why don't you write something about a coroner with a big-ass afro who keeps looking for love in all the dead places? 
 Hey! 
 It's always the bald guys with the hair jokes. 
 Guess it's all you have left. Ooh. 
 Hey. 
 Look, that's your future. 
 Look into the crystal ball. 
 Hey. Heard you guys need a car taken to the crime lab.

 (groans) 
 Would you relax, okay? 
 Don't go having a heart attack on me, Rog. I got this. 
 (groans) 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 (voice strained): Yup. 
 Get you to the doctor. 
 (siren blaring) 
 Hey, I do know CPR. 
 You put your lips on me, I'll shoot you. 
 (chuckles) 
 (groaning) 
 (indistinct female voice over P.A.) 
 Hey, you okay? 
 Is he all right? 
 It's okay. He's my partner. 
 He's okay now. 
 We're waiting for his test results to pinpoint exactly what happened. 
 Heart problems can cause sudden pain, shortness of breath, dizziness. 
 So he should rest at home and limit the excitement until we know more. 
 You hear that, Riggs? Limit the excitement. 
 I can be exciting. 
 In a bad way. Um, thanks, Doc. 
 Thanks, Doc. 
 Come on, let's go get this tow truck. 
 Hey, hey, whoa, I-I mean... look, I-I know I pretend to pay attention when people talk, but I think he just said you need to get some rest. 
 Yeah. I just rested for two hours in there. 
 Come on, I'm fine. 
 Ugh. All right. 
 Look, I... look, I think you need to take this seriously. 
 Riggs, people at work finally forgot that I had a heart attack last year, so not a word of this to them, or to Trish. 
 I don't want to worry her. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Just make sure you let me know, and Trish better not find out. 
 All right? She'll forgive you and and hate me forever. Then where will I eat? 
 Avery :  So explain this to me. 
 You lost the suspect. You know how he is. I say "Go left," he goes right. We had a choice, you know? Chase the bad guys, or baby-sit the drugs, and, well, I chase bad guys, so... For three hours? And we are exhausted, so I think maybe I'd vote for a little rest. You know, just kind of step back. Okay, now I know something's up. What happened? Okay, enough. Let's just come clean. It was Riggs's fault. You weren't the better driver today. It's okay. It happens. See? It's hard for him. Riggs : Yeah, it is. You know, it's just... It's a lot to process. Bailey : Got something! Scorsese ran the blood from the impound lot. The sample's a little corrupted, but it's a match to Dino Brant. We got a lead. Murtaugh : Dino Brant? I know that name. Guy has a record dating back to grade school. Stealing cars, robbery, safecracking. Led him time in San Quentin. Rumor was he was working for Angelo Casciano. Avery : Now that's a name that rings bells. Angelo Casciano has been on the LAPD's radar for years. He's a fence. Trades in everything from drugs to artwork. We haven't been able to catch him 'cause no one's been dumb or ballsy enough to flip on him. Yeah, could be why Dino kept his mouth shut and just did his time. Parole file has him working as a fry cook at a diner in the Valley. Perfect. I love fried foods. Come on, let's go. Oh. Um, or maybe... maybe we should go to the evidence room and sign in those drugs that we found. 'Cause that is the proper protocol, is it not? Yes. Yes, it is. Are-are you feeling okay, Riggs? Me? I'm good. I'm great. And you know what? I also forgot that I have got to run by Cahill's 'cause I don't want to miss these appointments. You can handle the paperwork, right? I couldn't even operate a vehicle. How am I gonna fill out paperwork? Good luck with Monty. How long we gonna do this, Monty? Got nothing but time, Roger. Isn't the statute of limitations on a grudge up after, like, 15 years? There's no limitations on destroying a man's career. I was your training officer. It was my obligation to assess you as honestly as I could. Oh, and you honestly just couldn't see me being a detective? I won't go so far as to say that you would have been useless, but I do think that your talents are best suited underground. I had to claw my way up from traffic cop to get here. All because you had to hate on a brother. Classic black-on-black crime. Not really, Monty. Not really. ♪ We're going to party... ♪ Murtaugh :  Hey, where's Riggs? Did he run out on his session? We had a session this morning, but once a day with Riggs is about all I can handle. But he said that you two had a... Damn it, Riggs. I know the feeling. ♪ ♪ Riggs :  Does Dino Brant work here? Dino? Uh, I think he's in the back taking a smoke break. Do you mind if I head on back there? We're old friends. Prison? AA? ♪ Yeah, it'll make you want to ♪ 
♪ Lay right down ♪ 
♪ And die... ♪ Hey. Who the hell are you? Easy, tough guy. Look, I'm a cop. I just want to ask you a few questions. Show me your badge then. (sighs) Ain't nothing there, man. All right. It's probably in the car. Man, just take my word for it and lower the weapon. No way. Yeah, but then I'm gonna have to take it from you. And you're gonna try to shoot me to make yourself feel better about the whole thing, so then we'll have you for attempted murder, and that's gonna be compiled like the possession and the grand theft auto. Hell, you know these charges better than I do. Bottom line, it's a bad idea. Walk away, man. (sighs) It's not my strong suit. All right, let's do this. Murtaugh : Yeah. Let's. As in "let us," like "us." The two of us, like partners. And you, hands up. Down on your knees. Interlace your fingers behind your neck. Riggs : You're supposed to be getting rest. You're not supposed to be here. Like hell I'm not. (groaning): Oh, come on. We're not staying for fries. It's not his first rodeo; he's not gonna talk until his attorney gets here. Don't try to change the subject. You didn't want to take me with you to get your boy Dino, because of... what the doctor said about me taking it easy. Yeah. That's right. He didn't want you to overexert yourself, so I took one for the team... again. We're partners, man. We follow leads together. Don't you understand the concept of... (Murtaugh and Riggs continue arguing) The question is, do you? Yeah. Hey, what's up, Trish? Murtaugh : Hey, baby. Hmm. What a surprise. Well, I'll tell you what a surprise is. Finding out that my husband and his partner arrested one of my clients. Dino is your client. Ah. I said I remembered that name, remember? I don't recall it. Trish : How do you forget a young man that I not only defended, but mentored? I put a lot of time into that boy, and I'll be damned if I let you undo it. Uh, Trish. I'm not judging your mentoring skills, at all, but the young man did pull a gun on me, so... Oh, yeah? Well, I saw the little report you filed. If you're lucky, I won't ask the judge to have you two officially apologize before it gets dismissed. Riggs : You look taller, Trish. Yes, and radiant. There's, there's a stature, like you-you have this... And you're working that outfit. The only thing I'm going to be working is the law that you two repeatedly abused on my client. It was Riggs' fault. Trish : Hmm. Murtaugh : By the time I got there, baby, all the infractions had already been committed. I simply provided handcuffs. Stop. Turn off the cameras and recorders in there. Yes. I need to spend some alone time with my client. Huh. So Trish is his attorney and mentor. Yeah. Listen, if we're gonna be partners, one of us better start paying attention when people are talking. Hmm. Trish : Turn 'em off. We said we'd never meet like this again. And I didn't do anything. Ooh, I want to believe you, Dino. Mrs. Murtaugh, you have known me since I was 15 years old. I would not lie to you. Not to you. (sighs) Good. Now, tell me everything. You two made a mistake. Dino's clean. Turn over another stone. This is why I love you. I mean, how do you get that big old heart into that tiny little perfect body? He's innocent. Why? Because he says he is? It's a pretty good reason. Murtaugh : Listen, Trish. I'm sorry we didn't tell you he was a suspect; I honestly forgot. But I'm sorry to tell you that he is guilty. "I'm sorry," huh? Remember those words. You'll be using them again. See you two at the arraignment. Murtaugh :  We have a situation, people. And her name is Trish Murtaugh. She is not, I repeat, not inclined to show you mercy. Come on, Murtaugh. You make her out to be some sort of monster. No, Bailey, I've seen my share of monsters working here on this job, and I've never been scared. She scares me. She scares me bad. She scares me. Hmm? I'm legitimately terrified of that little tiny lady. Avery : Okay. Well, maybe with your close proximity to legal on this case, it might not be a bad idea to reassign it. I agree with him. Why don't you sit this one out, buddy? Come on, you don't need the added stress. Murtaugh : We are right here. She's wrong. Avery : Fine. So far, we have a corrupt DNA sample that's inadmissible. A prior history that's inadmissible. And a boiler suit which is circumstantial. Dino have an alibi? We'll check. We got an address. He lives with his younger brother in Van Nuys. This kid named, um, Jerry. Talk to Jerry. Find me something we can use in court. (indistinct chatter) ♪ ♪ Jerry Brant? We have a few questions about your brother Dino. Do you know where he was at last night? Why are you guys harassing my brother? He didn't do anything. He was at home all night with me... watching TV. Yeah? What were you watching? A Lakers' game. They were off. I meant to say the Clippers. Who were they playing? I can't remember. What were you doing after the game? We went to sleep. All right, listen, Jerry. If your brother actually cared about you, he wouldn't put you in this position. Asking you to lie to us. My brother would do anything for me. I've seen his record. And your brother would do anything, period. Your brother's a scumbag, Jer. You and I both know. (inhales and spits) Classy, Jerry. Call us if you and your brother decide you don't want to be roommates in prison. Murtaugh :  Are you sure  you can handle Trish in there? Would you relax? I've done hundreds of these arraignments. You don't know what's about to go down, do you? Hey, guys. First of all, forgive me for earlier. And this is just a formality, so just try to keep it friendly. (laughing): Okay? Martin, would you like to come over to dinner tonight? No. He would not. I know what you're trying to do. Don't think I don't know. Relax, Roger. Tell him to relax. I was just telling him to relax. And yes, Trish, dinner sounds lovely. Thank you. Perfect. See? What did I tell you? Nothing to worry about. You're just dumb, you know that? Court Clerk :  Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,  and nothing but the truth? I do. Detective Riggs. How did you ID my client? We had a DNA sample. A tainted sample that doesn't conclusively ID him. Did you have a warrant to search his locker? Uh, no, but when I walked in... Did you identify yourself as a police officer? Absolutely. Did you show him your badge? I would have, but I couldn't find it at that particular time, but I did find it later, so we're good on it. Trish : Tainted sample, warrantless search. Any legal grounds for this arrest? Look, you can split all the legal hairs you want. We had his DNA. We had the clothes that he was wearing, and we know his MO. We all felt that he was guilty. (laughing): Oh, I'm sorry. You feel he's guilty? Okay. So what does that feel like, huh? A tickle in the back of the throat? Or a twitch of an eye? We had more than a feeling, Trish. Well, you know who had a feeling? Mr. Brant. When he saw a strange, unkempt, armed man burglarizing his locker. Well, the part you're leaving out is that your client pulled a gun on me. Trish : And where was your partner during all of this? Hmm? Or did you go there alone so you could violate my client's constitutional rights without a witness? My partner was detained, and, uh, he was late arriving to the scene. Oh. Okay. Detained doing what? Sometimes we find more success in divide and conquer. So where was your partner? Riggs : Well, we had several leads that, uh, we needed to follow, and I... Trish : Your Honor. Detective Riggs is being evasive. He has a reputation for going rogue and not following procedure, because of his unwillingness to tell the truth under oath, I move to have this case dismissed immediately. Trish. He's guilty. Come on. Trish : Give me the truth, Riggs, or are you even capable? Listen. I... Detective. You're withholding information. I left my partner behind because... Answer the question. Where was your partner? He had heart problems earlier today, Trish. And I was worried about him. (door opens) Anything else, Detective? Well, I guess I won't be swinging by dinner tonight. 
 
 Cahill : Heard about court last night. Mm-hmm. Cahill : How's everything now? Well, Murtaugh's pissed. Trish, too. I was under oath, what was I going to do, lie? Of course not. So what's the problem? Is there one? Nope. Not for me. (chuckles, clicks tongue) Don't. What? The little shrinky smile thing that you do; don't do it. (laughing): I wasn't aware I did it. Well, you do, and it's annoying, and judgey, to be honest. You know? Like you know something I don't. Okay. Do you? Ah, there's the smile again. All right, let's just get to it, all right? Go ahead. Get all shrinky on me. It occurred to me that maybe you wanted to tell Trish about Murtaugh's heart condition because you're worried about him. Come on, Doc. I'd come to expect a higher quality analysis from, you know, a professional such as yourself. And you're afraid to lose another partner. Wow. You didn't throw anything. You're still here. I will count that as progress. Perfect. I want you to put that in your file, tell Avery I'm cured, and I'll get out of your hair. (clicks tongue) Take it easy, Doc. ♪ Come along and ride ♪

I just didn't want you to worry. What if you had died, Roger? Then we wouldn't be having this fight. When do your test results get back? Tomorrow. The LAPD can survive without you. You need to stay home. Can't. Since you decided to be Super Lawyer and get Dino released on bail, my job just got harder. So when I'm not home, thank yourself. Roger Jr. : Hey, guys! Guys! I'm buying a car! Woman :  Two great features  are the intelligent four-wheel drive and the foot-activated lift gate. Wow. (chuckles) Wow.

There's a known criminal on the loose, and our son may need to  escape  danger. Trish : That criminal is too smart to steal a car from the cops and then hide his bad guy costume in an open locker. Brenda? Can you tell us about the intelligent features? We need that right now. How would you explain all the evidence stacked up against him? I don't have to explain it. You're the detective.

Oh, now that you're not on the stand, you clam up. What did you want me to do? Would you like me to lie? I was under oath, Roger. It's all right. She would've found out anyway. That woman is relentless. The DNA belongs to Dino's brother, Jerry. Damn. Now I got to tell her she was right. You want me to... want me to go with you? You would do that for me?

He owes me that money. I guess you better talk to him then. No, no, no, see, I'm done talkin'. You've inherited his debt. Like hell. I took the heat for you once. I did time for it.

He's got other qualities. I'm an excellent dancer. What are we... Just stop. It's what they do. Okay, okay. You guys don't understand. Angelo doesn't do time. And the only way that you're ever gonna get to him is if you get me two mil or two mil in coke. Two mil in coke, you say? Trish, I think it's best if you're not part of this conversation. I'm still his lawyer. I don't want my client to incriminate himself. It's not your client that we're worried about. Fine. Remember your promise. Riggs : Thanks, Trish.

Riggs : Roger, I need to look like his hostage, no? For that, he needs to have a weapon. Right? And what if things go south? Not that things are gonna go south, all right? Usually our plans go north. But if they do, wouldn't it be nice to have an extra guy with a gun on our side, right? Here. You know what, I should be going in there with you guys. Well, if you'd like to trade places with me and deal with Trish, we can arrange that. No. We better stick to the plan. You've done this before, yeah? Yeah. I lost a bet one time at a demolition derby outside of El Paso. Oh, you mean drug busts? Yeah. Oh, yeah, tons. Murtaugh : I still think I should be in there with you. Oh, come on, everyone has fun in the van, right? So I've heard. I've never actually been in the van. You keep it up, you gonna be in the trunk. (engine starts) All right, let me hear. One, one, one. All right, Rog,  we got Angelo, two gunmen  and one more guy in the truck. Who's your little friend? I don't remember telling you to bring a date. He's a crooked cop. I had to jack him to get your stuff. There it is. (chuckles) See? I always knew you'd find a way. Mmm. Where's Jerry? When I have the coke, then you get your brother. That was the deal. Right. No, no, no. See, first I have to make sure it's all here, right? Got him. Riggs : Don't move yet. I still have no sign of the brother. Dino (on wire) : Count 'em up. All right, you got your drugs, where's my brother? Guess we don't need the car anymore. Bobby. Don't need the cop anymore either. Push him into the bay. (grunts) Uh, hey, Rog? Now might be the time for you to, uh you know, prove that the guys in the van have all the fun. Angelo, this was not our deal. See, I've never been much for cops, even crooked ones. Never been much for family reunions either. Where is he? Easy. Where is he?! Where do you think? Back up or he's dead. Back up! Aah! Open the trunk. Let him go! He's there. Easy. (grunts) (grunting) (screams) (inhales deeply) (muffled grunting) ♪ ♪ Riggs! Rog, Rog? Ro... No, no, no! (gasping) Well, look at it this way: least you're getting some exercise. So you forged my signature, risking my career and reputation so you that you could steal millions of dollars in drugs to trade for a hostage. Did I miss anything? I was mostly in the van. We really didn't  steal. I mean, it was more like we borrowed. and your signature is so forgeable And when I found out, that I felt like I've got to... Captain, why, forge his signature, right? I was flabbergasted. It's not like... We weren't gonna sell the drugs. I was shocked and appalled... All... that matters is that we caught Angelo Casciano. Amen. Do you know how long I've wanted to put him behind bars? He's been on my bucket list for years. (laughs) I mean, Cap, that's... that's kind of sad. I mean, you need to take a look at that bucket list. - Yeah. You know? What you need to do is go sign the drugs back into evidence and then there's something about-about a beer with Monty? You know what, fine. I happen to like Monty. Ooh, here's an idea: maybe I'll bring him by your house for dinner later. (gasps) Ooh! Don't you dare, Riggs. How's that ticker of yours, Rog? Wha... F-Fine, why? Stop. Look, I get why you didn't want everyone around here to know, but there's something you need to know: there is not a person in this division... hell, the entire LAPD... who thinks that you are damaged goods. So get that out of your head. Thanks. And please take care of yourself. If you haven't noticed, you're the best cop I got. I did my best to keep him away from that life, I swear. Everybody makes their own decisions. Nothing you could do about that. Yeah. He's not cut out for prison, though. They're gonna eat him up in there. If he testifies against Angelo, I'll cut him a deal with the D.A. He will. You have my word. Okay. Hey. I'm sorry. I feel like I let you down. You did what you had to do. I will never forget how you cared enough to put time into me, I swear. All I can say is thank you for looking out for me once again. Thanks for trusting me. Hey. Thank you for being someone that I could trust. Okay? I'm proud of you. (elevator bell dings) Hey. Hey. How's Murtaugh? Oh, you know, got a little wet, but, uh... he'll live. I would ask how you're doing, but we both know how that goes. Well, I did almost drown. I mean, I was thinking about that, but... How are you doing, Riggs? I'm a little hungry. Thanks for asking. Where's your ring? ♪ I got some money and found myself a car... ♪ It, uh... came off in the water. Came down to it or me, so... Was that an easy choice? You kidding? Just a piece of metal. ♪ And I'm going north... ♪ Murtaugh :  I'm gonna start listening  to everything the doctor tells me to do. I mean, I don't want to be anywhere near another hospital anytime soon. Amen to that. I mean, if he wants me to get exercise to test out this pacemaker, then who am I to question him? I mean, the man is a professional. That's what I'm talking about. Mm-hmm. The only thing I would want to do different is the type of exercise. I mean, swimming and jogging... not so much. No? Mm. What's your thing? Well... there's this new thing that the kids are doing. It's supposed to get your heart rate up and relax you at the same time. Oh, my gosh. Yes. Should I lock the door? Maybe you want to leave it cracked just in case I need to be resuscitated. Oh. You just might. I hope so. ♪ I don't know where I'm going ♪ 
♪ Till I get there... ♪ Get a closer look, son. Looks like something's already caught your eye. ♪ Maybe I'll find love... ♪ Don't look so glum. She'll get over it. Lots of men lose rings. Love is forever. Don't you ever forget that. I couldn't agree more. Thank you.
