 William Bradford : They called us pilgrims. But today we are thieves. We trust in God's design. Our faith helped us to cross an ocean. Faith and a contract with strangers, the Merchant Adventurer Company. Without whose support, we could not afford the journey. They came for fortune. We came for God. To build a new life. To worship as we pleased, free from persecution. Starved and desperate, 102 passengers arrived in the New World, guided by the Lord. But there were some things God neglected to mention. 
 Myles Standish : Move! For the shore! 
 [arrows whizzing] 
 Stephen Hopkins : Musket! 
 [thunder] 
 [coughs] 
 Oakes : Hold him. Hey, watch this. First time at sea, Mr. Bradford? I have seen you and your lovely wife at the rail often enough. Spewing into the wind. 
 W. Bradford : It is not my first time. I have sailed from England to Holland and back several times. 
 Oakes : With all due respect, sir, such as that's a Sunday outing on the Thames. Not that you would desecrate the Sabbath by taking pleasure in it, if you catch my meaning. 
 W. Bradford : I am not certain that I do. 
 Oakes : Well, how shall I put it? The worst is yet to come. 
 W. Bradford : We have come this far and not lost a single soul. We will endure. 
 Oakes : And a week from now? When the water is nothing but scum at the bottom of the barrels and the scurvy rips through your congregation like grease through a goose, will you endure then? 
 W. Bradford : By God's grace, we will. 
 Oakes : I wager that before we make landfall that l'll be sewing half your people into shrouds and tossing 'em overboard. 
 W. Bradford : I hope you are not so inconvenienced. 
 Oakes : Not at all. It would be my pleasure. 
 W. Bradford : Good evening to you both. 
 Alden : Why do you talk to the man like that? 
 Oakes : I sailed to Jamestown with Blackwell Separatists. High and mighty, such as these. 180 of 'em packed together like herrings. No freshwater, scanty rations. 'God will provide, God will provide.' 130 of 'em died en route. God has chosen them, alright... to die of scurvy and the flux, and their own pride and self-righteousness. And He will choose these, too. 
 [crying] 
 [people coughing] 
 Elizabeth Hopkins : Don't lie to me! 
 Elinor Billington : My boys do not steal! 
 E. Hopkins : Well, I saw it with my very own eyes! Look at them! They've barely shed an ounce since they've been on this journey. 
 E. Billington : Watch your words, you bitch! If my speech offends thee, Mrs. Bradford, stop your saintly ears. My boys are of hearty stock, plain and simple. 
 E. Hopkins : Does it mean nothing to you that I am with child? Have you no charity? You are a mother! 
 W. Bradford : I know it troubles you, but God chose these strangers to be our partners in this venture. 
 Dorothy Bradford : God and the Merchant Adventurers Company. 
 W. Bradford : We needed their investment to finance the voyage. We could not manage it on our own. 
 D. Bradford : But we're stuck with them. Fortune hunters. Criminals even. They do not fear God as we do. They do not keep the Sabbath. This is not what I imagined when we left Holland. 
 W. Bradford : Perhaps God is testing us. 
 D. Bradford : We have sold our house and all we own. Left everything and everyone we know behind. How much more can He test us? 
 W. Bradford : As much as He needs. As much as we can bear. 
 D. Bradford : William. I worry constantly if we've done the right thing. 
 W. Bradford : There is no wrong in this journey. We are Pilgrims. 
 D. Bradford : How can you say we are not wrong? We left our child behind. 
 W. Bradford : At least for now. Until it is safe, until he is old enough. 
 D. Bradford : But I miss him so. 
 W. Bradford : I miss him, too. 
 D. Bradford : Will we all be together again in this world? 
 W. Bradford : Have faith. This voyage is what God intends for us. 
 D. Bradford : Then, 'tis as you say, husband. We are Pilgrims. 
 Christopher Jones : 'Tis slow going, Mr. Clark. At this speed, it'll be another month till Virginia. 
 John Clark : Had we sailed in August, Captain. 
 Jones : If wishes were horses. 
 Clark : We'd be riding these westerlies home, instead of beating our heads against them. 
 Jones : 'Tis not just the wind that bothers me. Tension mounts belowdecks, and unlike water, it can only seep up. 
 Giles Heale : Mr. Carver, your wife's gums are gingival. They're like paper. I could put my finger through them. [coughs] How long have your teeth been loose? 
 Catherine Carver : Some weeks now. 
 John Carver : Catherine. And you've not told me? 
 C. Carver : You have more important matters to worry over than my teeth, dear husband. 
 Heale : You have scurvy, Mrs. Carver. But you are not alone. It is rampant. 
 J. Carver : What can you give her for it? 
 Heale : If I could, a lemon. Anything other than beer and ship biscuit for sustenance. Proper rations, medicine, all the things that we lack. That's what l'd give her. No, the cure for her and everyone else suffering is to get off this damn vessel and onto dry land. 
 S. Hopkins : Doctor? Mrs. Carver. Please. Please, come quick. 
 [screaming] 
 D. Bradford : It's alright. 
 E. Hopkins : Oh, God! 
 D. Bradford : It's alright. Her spasms come ever quicker. It's alright. 
 E. Hopkins : Damn this ship, damn you, Stephen Hopkins, you lying b*st*rd! 
 S. Hopkins : I dare say her wit remains intact. 
 E. Hopkins : Do you find humor in this? 
 S. Hopkins : No, no, no, I merely mean to bring some lightness into... 
 E. Hopkins : Get out! 
 [screaming] 
 Heale : Mrs. Carver is a midwife. 
 D. Bradford : In Holland, I have assisted the midwives often. 
 Heale : Good. Follow Mrs. Carver's lead. Mrs. Hopkins. 
 D. Bradford : Stop it. 
 [screaming] 
 Martin : Who attends her? 
 Jones : The ship's surgeon, Mr. Heale, and a midwife. Have you been below deck, Mr. Martin? 
 Martin : I have not. 
 Jones : 'Tis vile. The Mayflower was never meant to carry passengers. 'Tis a cargo ship meant for wine and woolens, not women and children. 
 Martin : We all must make do. 
 Jones : 102 souls crammed in a hold meant for hogsheads of butter and beer. 
 'Tis a filthy, stinking kennel. It's fit for a bitch to birth a litter, but not a woman to have her baby. 
 Martin : I hope all goes well. 
 Standish : You better hope so. Hopkins and his wife expected this baby to be born in Virginia, not at sea. 
 Martin : What has that to do with me? 
 Standish : You know nothing of the men your company have contracted for this settlement? 
 Martin : Only yourself, Mr. Standish, due to the endless, self-aggrandizing tales of your time in battle. 
 Standish : It's Captain Standish, Mr. Martin. And while I have killed men in the field of battle, it's not me with whom you should be concerned. Huh? Huh? He knows nothing of the soon-to-be father down below. The Captain here was even reluctant to let him on the ship. 
 Martin : Why is that? 
 Standish : Well, because Stephen Hopkins is a notorious hothead. He led a mutiny in Bermuda. Sentenced to hang. Cheated the gallows. Somehow talked his way out of it. 
 Martin : Well, if the Captain saw fit to allow him on the ship, l'm sure we have nothing to fear. 
 Standish : Well, the Captain here will not be held responsible for the, for the endless delays that have resulted in this baby being born at sea in squalid conditions. No, that rests solely on you and the Merchants Company. If aught goes awry with his wife and child, Hopkins will know damn well who to blame. 
 [screaming] 
 Giles Hopkins : Is she going to die? 
 Constance Hopkins : Our mother did when she had you. 
 S. Hopkins : Hush! That's not fair. It was not your brother's fault. Your mother succumbed to an unseen weakness. Your stepmother is stronger than she was. She's not going to die. 
 [screaming] 
 D. Bradford : It's okay. 
 C. Carver : You're doing so well. Just breathe. 
 D. Bradford : It's okay. [screaming] There you go. It's alright, you're almost there. 
 Heale : Yes. Yes. 
 D. Bradford : That's it. 
 Heale : Oh. Yes. Oh, very good. 
 D. Bradford : That's it. 
 [baby cries] 
 [laughter, cheering] 
 Jones : The baby lives. 
 Martin : That is good news, indeed. 
 D. Bradford : It's a boy. 
 C. Carver : Here you go. 
 E. Hopkins : Stephen Hopkins! 
 S. Hopkins : You see? I told you your stepmother was strong. Ha!

 Jones : What's happened, Mr. Alden? 
 Alden : It's fractured, Captain. 
 Jones : If it cracks completely, this ship will flounder and break apart. 
 Alden : l'll do what I can, but I don't have the means to fix it proper. 
 W. Bradford : Well, what is it you need, Mr. Alden, to make this repair? 
 Alden : Something to hold it in place long enough to bind it. 
 Winslow : We have our screw jacks for building houses. Will that help? 
 Alden : It's worth a try. Will you go and fetch it? 
 W. Bradford : We cannot do that. 
 Jones : This ship will sink!

 Jones : Will it hold? ALDEN: For now. 
 Alden : But it will require more repair than this. 
 Jones : Well done, Mr. Alden, well done. We were meant to land at the mouth of the Hudson. The northernmost part of Virginia. 
 Martin : Yes, where we have the patent for our colony. 
 Jones : Mm-hmm. Now, we are on course to here, Cape James. And with the broken beam and the weather, it's likely that this is as far as we'll get this winter. 
 Martin : We cannot plant our colony wheresoever we please. 
 Standish : You heard Captain Jones. We cannot reach Virginia. 
 Billington : But we have a place in Virginia. 
 W. Bradford : If God sees fit to deliver us further north, to this shore, then maybe this is where He intends for us to make our plantation. 
 S. Hopkins : Perhaps he's right. For there, we are no longer bound into previous agreements. 
 W. Bradford : Mr. Hopkins, this is not the time to do this. 
 Martin : Everyone knows your history, sir. And though you are a notorious mutineer, you remain under contract no matter where we land. 
 S. Hopkins : Oh, I beg to differ. 
 Winslow : We are bound together in this venture, Mr. Hopkins, your people and ours. We need to make a common cause for a better life, for all of us. 
 S. Hopkins : Common cause? With us? With those that you call strangers? 
 Winslow : We mean no offense by it. 
 Billington : The hell you don't! 
 W. Bradford : Mr. Martin, will the Merchant Adventurers Company honor our claim to this new territory? 
 Martin : I cannot say. We will only know that once the Mayflower returns to England, and a fresh ship arrives to replenish the colony. 
 S. Hopkins : A year from now. 
 Billington : 'Tis too risky. What if the Crown evicts us then? All our toil would have been for naught. 
 J. Carver : Our situation has changed entirely. We will need a new agreement. 
 Martin : I cannot negotiate a new contract on behalf of the Company. 
 J. Carver : Not with the Company, sir, between us. Every man, saint and stranger, even the servants. 
 F. Billington : What do the servants got to do with this? 
 J. Carver : Because they will share the risk of settling in unknown territory. I propose a compact that pledges our fealty to the Crown, establishes our claim to these new lands, and establishes our governance therein and by which we shall all be bound. 
 W. Bradford : Aye. 
 Winslow : Aye. 
 W. Bradford : Mr. Hopkins. Does it suit you? 
 S. Hopkins : It is certain. Bound together. 
 Standish : Captain Jones. How many days are we from land? 
 Jones : I cannot say exact. We haven't had a clear night sky, or seen a star since setting sail. I can only make a run for it. 
 E. Hopkins : So, will you sign it? 
 S. Hopkins : For a clean start, I will sign it, yes. I mean, the compact will only govern conduct amongst ourselves. As far as l'm concerned, we're on our own. 
 E. Hopkins : On our own in unsettled land. 
 S. Hopkins : Yes. 
 E. Hopkins : So you alone will defend us against the savages? 
 S. Hopkins : I assure you I will protect my family, as I always have. 
 E. Hopkins : You assured me that this baby would be born in Virginia. 
 S. Hopkins : Do you trust me? I need to know, I need to hear it. I need to hear it from your lips. Do you trust me?

 W. Bradford : You are a despicable man, Mr. Oakes! 
 [coughing] You're okay, Mr. Howland? 
 Howland : Yes. 
 W. Bradford : The just hand of God was upon our brother and servant, John Howland, that night. The just hand of God reached into the depths and pulled him from a certain death. We do not know why. The just hand of God has also touched another, a proud and profane young man, Mr. Oakes. It pleased him to smite this young man with a grievous disease from which he died in a desperate manner. We do not question the will of God. Let us pray for this young man.
