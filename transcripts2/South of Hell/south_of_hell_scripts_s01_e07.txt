 I didn't know where the needle came from, and I didn't care. 
 All I knew is that I didn't want to feel this pain anymore. 
 Just that warm, familiar comfort, singing inside my blood. You feel like  the weight of the world is on your shoulders? Like there is no light at the end of the tunnel? [woman on TV cries] Then let A&O Life Success Seminars build a better you with just three magic words. All : Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! [claps] Take life now! Take life now! Whoo! All : Take life now! Yeah! Whoo, whoo! That's right, folks. Whoo! Seize your destiny. Let A&O help make your dreams come true. Now, maybe you're thinking it can't happen to you. Or maybe you're thinking that you're just born to lose. Mm-mm-mm. You, sir. What's your name? David. Okay. Well, tell me... before you came to A&O, you were a boozer, a user, a loser. Does that sound about right? Come on up here. [cheers] Come on! [cheers and applause] What the hell? - It's okay. [sighs] You're okay. You see, a long time ago, I was just like David. I let everyone else's problems become my problems. Just dragging me down with 'em. You have people like that in your life, David? Just feeding off you like a leech? I don't... I don't know. Do you have any family? Sister. Oh! You hear that? It's his sister. No. That's not what I meant.  We all know the type. It's our family. It's our so-called friends that we try to help but only get us into trouble. Well, that stops right here. We need to find our own success before we can succeed in helping anyone else. You need to learn how to take life now! [cheers and applause] Say it, David. Come on. Feels good. Say it, David! Come on, David. Take life now. - Yes, take it. Yeah, take life. Take life now! [cheers and applause] All : Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! I have a feeling he's going to do great things. Both : Take life now! Take life now! Take life now. Take life now. Take life now. [Cross My Heart's "Wild Side"] ♪ ♪

You're hurting yourself. Stop! I hate you. I hate you! [shrieks] [glass shatters] Gracie! [screams] Gracie! [sobs] Ba... baby, I'm so... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [sobs] Please believe me... I never meant for you to get hurt. Mom said you were a good man. Maybe not good enough. [cries] [dog barks] [sighs] David! [knocks on door] Hey. Hey. I've been calling you all night. I know. I'm sorry I just ran out on you like that. No, don't worry about that right now. Did you find her? The rev's girl? Yeah. Yeah, we found her. Where was she? Hey, I'm not interrogating you right now. I just want to know everyone's okay. I'm not okay. Did somebody hurt you? I've just been to hell and back. Listen, there's nothing you can do about this. You don't know that, all right? I care about you, a lot, and there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you. Just tell me. If I told you what it is, there's a chance you'd stop feeling that way. Trust me. Trusting people hasn't been working out too well for me lately, Dusty. I... If you see my brother come home, will you let me know? [sighs] God, David, please just be okay. A&O is more than just a company. It's about real American values, changing the way we live our lives one person at a time, and now for the first time ever, A&O is offering all of you the chance to take life now at our brand-new success retreat. Take life now. His word was spreading, promising a life without obligation or complication or consequence, because the things that make us human...  Make us weak. He was a prophet for our times, a new gospel for the ages. [sighs] What was she like? She tried to be happy. I think more for me and David than for herself. It wasn't easy in that house, even before Sangolo. I can't forgive your dad for not telling us the truth about Mom, but if he really did make her happy, even for a little while, then without him, we wouldn't have you. How come you don't have the mark? We're both born from an angel. I don't know. Mom said something down there about Trinity. Like the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost? Blood of my blood. That's why I felt so much stronger when we were together. We're both parts of the same whole. Then there's still a part missing. What happened to your collar? Not until I've earned the right to wear it again. I let revenge take over. Told myself I was fighting God's war when it was really my own. Should have told you truth, no matter what. This is everyone's war now. Enos has an entire army waiting to be unleashed. If we don't find a way to destroy him, then nothing will stop him from taking over Charleston, one soul at a time. Enos has been going after all three of you. Ever since that mark first appeared on your back, he's kept the three of you apart. He's scared. Angel, demon... So what's David? He's like me. He's human. So this is it, then? What you've always wanted. What do you mean? His power is what bound me to you. Once he's destroyed... I'll finally be free. And I'll go back to hell. You know what will happen to me down there. Don't put that burden on me. After everything you've done to me. What about everything I've done for you? All the times I saved your life, Grace's life, David's life. What about my life? You've known since the beginning I wanted you out. You just never believed I'd be strong enough to finally do it. Maybe you are stronger than I thought, but it's still not enough. You can't beat Enos without me, so why should I help you if it means digging my own grave? I can't keep living with a demon inside of me. Then I'll let Enos kill us both if I have to. Promise me, Maria... Promise me you won't let me die if I do this for you. [phone beeps and vibrates] [sighs] Dusty. I'll be right there. [door opens] David. Hi, Mar. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. You sure? Yeah. Like I said. Stop! What are you doing? I put my own life on hold for too long. I think it's time I move on. You know? I'm tired of fighting. Excuse me? What's gotten into you? David, I need you right now... "I need, I need, I need." You should hear yourself sometime. Well, guess what, Mar. Your problems aren't my problems. What I need is to start taking life now. Are you high? First time in my life I feel good about myself, the first thing out of your mouth is that I'm a junkie. Another reason I'm leaving. Thanks. I didn't mean it like that. You just don't understand, Maria. Everything isn't always about you. We can't all just be daddy's little princess. What the hell are you talking about? You and that demon bitch. Watch it, David. Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do? See, you can't even take care of things yourself. You need some thousand-year-old bitch. Well, you'd be nothing without me! [growls] No. [growls] Maria, you okay? [growls] Get out! [grunts] [David chuckles] [growls] You're a hard woman to get alone, Abigail. Save your breath, whoever you are in there. [chuckles] It's okay. I don't need Maria killing herself if David gets hurt, so I'll be nice and gentle when I rip you out. You're playing for the wrong team. Enos wants to make a deal. I don't make deals. It's okay. Maria can't hear us now. It's just you and me. [grunts] [cracks neck] [chuckles] There's nothing Enos has that I want. But he wants you. [chuckles] Let's have a drink. You really think Maria is the one Enos is after? She's just another mortal, but you, Abigail, you were supposed to be his queen. That ship sailed a long time ago. I'm a traitor. If I go back now, it's a death sentence. What if Enos can make all that go away, grant you a full pardon, wipe the record clean? He can do that? Enos is second in command, beautiful... Above and below. He's got the position and clout to do anything he wants. But Maria... Has been trying to get rid of you since the beginning. You owe her nothing. Even if you stay inside Maria until she's a hundred years old, that's just a blink of an eye for you. One day, she'll die, and then you'll die too. [snickers] Unless you do the smart thing. What does he want me to do? I'd always hoped Maria would be strong enough on her own. Truth is... You've always been part of this fight. Every father hopes his daughter is special and will do great things. Should be counting my blessings. [sighs] And I'll do anything I can to help you. They say that siblings are the friends God gave you, the only ones who can truly see the person you are inside. Abigail. David. [groans] Wake up. Mm. What happened? Abigail. I don't remember. She took over when you changed. Oh, my God. Did I hurt you? I don't think so, but tell me what you remember. We were screaming. Dusty came in. Dusty. [exhales] He saw Abigail. Maria, she killed my demon. You sure? She saved my life. It's okay. You're safe now. Just rest. [car starts] [door shuts] Dusty. Dusty, wait! Not unless you can explain what I saw back there. You know, no more bullshit, all right? I deserve more than that from you. Either you tell me what the hell is going on... The truth... or I'm done. You're gonna think I'm crazy. Right now, I think I'm probably crazy. Remember this morning I said I'd been to hell and back? What are you telling me? What you saw back there was a demon. My demon. I know. It's insane. I've seen things too... when I was fighting overseas... a kind of darkness in people I didn't think I could ever explain to another human being. The kind of darkness that takes you over, controls you. That thing... that demon. Abigail. It's her name. You can control her? Sometimes. I'm trying. I've never met anyone like you before, Maria. So you're not leaving then? No. 
 
 [soft music] ♪ ♪ What's wrong? I've only felt this way with one other man before. ♪ ♪ Listen, Dusty. There's a lot more trouble still coming. There's something I have to do. Then let me help you. I'm serious. This isn't me pushing you away. Just give me a little more time to see this thing through. Whatever you need. ♪ ♪ [sniffs] After everything that happened, I was just in so much pain. I didn't see Dad coming until it was too late. I'm sorry. It's okay, David. He went after you because he's desperate. He knows he can't beat us if we're all together. What else do you remember? Some big retreat coming up. Everybody at A&O was talking about it. That demon that he put inside me, it wanted me to bring you there... to Enos. With David still possessed, there'd be no Trinity. You all would have walked straight into his hands. So let's give him what he wants. What are you talking about? No, he's right. If Enos still thinks you're under his control... Then I can lead us right to him. Mom said that, with the three of us together, we could destroy him, right? We don't even know how this Trinity is supposed to work. We're all here now. I don't feel any different. It has to work. We can finally end this for good. We just have to have a little faith. Isn't that what you always say, Bledsoe? Where is this retreat supposed to happen? [scoffs] Where do you think? Sangolo. If there is such a thing as hell on Earth, then it's a place I've already been. We all have. Sangolo. I used to swear I'd never go back until Father showed me the light. [horn blares] [seagulls call] Look at all these lost souls. They have no idea they're on their way to see the Devil. We have to play along for now. We don't have a choice. Sangolo is where it all started, and that's where it's going to end. Why would A&O build anything there after what happened? I would have thought the whole island was condemned. Because this is Enos' new Order of Everlasting. A crowd of new hosts for his army of demons. [indistinct chatter] - Watch your step, please. Right this way. Grace, you okay? [sighs] What we did... Almost did. You're still innocent, remember? That's not the point. It was wrong. We didn't know. No matter what... I still love you. It's just a different kind of love now. [sighs] I know. Don't worry. It'll all be okay once we get to Sangolo Island. Maria! What are you doing here? I'm coming with you. Look, I meant what I said before. I know you can take care of yourself, but if you got trouble coming, I want to be there when it happens. Maria senses something. I can see the way she looks at me... uncertain. But it doesn't matter now. Once we're on Sangolo, nothing else will matter ever again. Watch your step on the way down, folks. Greetings, all. Welcome to the first day of your brand-new lives. Now, you lucky folks are the first to visit our brand-new campus. This is sick. I know, but it'll be over soon. Leading each of you through several orientation exercises in preparation for tonight's seminar. Now, remember... true success begins with self-reliance. Come on in. Now, as you enter the retreat, you may become separated from the parties you've arrived with. Show us that confidence. Break away from your friends and your family. Blaze your own new trail. Come on in. Right this way, princess. [shudders] Maria, what just happened? He knows we're here. Who knows we're here? What's wrong? Where are the others? Where's David? I don't know. They... they were right here. Okay, this group right with me. Come on, stay with me. This island plays tricks on you. Hello? Where'd everyone go? Maria? David? Dad? [singsong] Gracie. David, is that you? You were right, Grace. What we did was very, very bad. But don't worry. Soon all of that pain will be gone. He'll make all the bad feelings go away. [grunts] [screams] Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Open this door! The next step to success is letting go of that which you cannot control. What's so important on the other side? [indistinct chatter] My daughter. "My"? See, that's an interesting word, "my." It implies ownership. This man believes that a grown woman is his possession, that he owns her. No one here belongs to anyone else, my friend. Who do you think you are? I'm not gonna ask you again. Yeah, good job. Get angry. Show some passion. Take life now! All : Take life now! Take life now! I guess you were right, Reverend. You can own another person. All : Take life now! And now, you belong to him. We have to find David and Grace. Looks like everyone just disappeared. [breathes heavily] Do you like what I've done with the place? Sure is nice to have you in your old room again. What is this place? It's evil. No matter how he tries to dress it up. Who? My father, Enos. He's the one who put that demon inside you? Listen to me. He can't hurt you now. You got my word, Maria. You can't promise that. [high-pitched whine] What's that sound? I don't know. Come on. Our family is home again, and home is a place where nothing bad can ever happen. Let me out of here! ♪ I don't want to choose ♪ [guitar playing] ♪ I want you all for myself ♪ 
♪ But this world don't make sense ♪ 
♪ It's never easy ♪ That's the first song Mom ever taught me how to play. You know that feeling when it's like you're channeling something from some higher plane, like you're just a vessel for something much bigger? That's what's happening, and it feels good, Gracie. Everything feels so good. It's not real, David, and I know there's still a part of you that can hear me. Help me, David. Don't let him hurt us again. I would never let anyone hurt you. [chuckles] Don't you remember those early days at Everlasting? How easy everything was? It's only once we got out into the real world that everything got so difficult, so confusing. We were just kids. We were free. Snap out of it. You shouldn't have done that. I wasn't free. I was his. I'm just trying to help you, Grace. Why can't you see that? [sighs] [door creaks] Hey. What? Do you hear that? [indistinct chatter] Yeah. All: Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! I think it's coming from in there. All: Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Don't touch her! No! Dusty! All : Take life now! Get off of me! Maria! Let go of me! All : Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! No! David! David! All : Take life now! Take life now! Take life now! Abigail, I'm gonna need you! All : Take life now! Take life now! [all chanting in foreign language] Abigail! [screaming] Abigail! She has her mother's voice, doesn't she? [sighs] Enos. Here we are, Elijah. Just you and me. [Maria screams] Can I pour you one? No... no, you're a mean drunk. Abigail! Abigail. Now, in recovery, you remember the step about giving yourself up to a higher power? Don't you think it's obvious the higher power's already given up on you? Mmm. Now, I have to get back to my little party, but first I'm gonna watch you beg while I take away everything you love like you did to me. [screams] No! Gracie. You stole my wife. You seduced her into leaving her children. You broke my family apart. So who's the devil? You make me sick, you pious hypocrite. [grunts] But I do thank you for Grace. I'm gonna have a hell of a lot of fun gutting that little angel of yours. Leave my daughter alone! Aren't you gonna beg? No! Well, if you're not gonna beg... Ahh! Die! [screams] Aah! [all chanting in foreign language] [chanting continues] Abigail, please. Where are you? Shh, it's okay, Maria. I'm right here. No! No! [screams and whimpers] I'm sorry it had to be this way, but like you always said, this relationship wasn't good for either of us. What have you done? The same thing you would have done to me if you had the chance. We're finally going to be rid of each other, just not the way you hoped. Whatever Enos told you, it's a lie. You have to help me stop this! Oh, Maria. Don't make this any harder on yourself than it has to be. You still think you're the strong one. Before this is over, Abigail, I swear I'll make you pay for what you've done. [hyperventilating] [grunts] What's the matter, son? Do I have to watch this part? You want your sister to be happy again, don't you? She doesn't look happy. Neither did Grace. That's because it's not over yet. No. This isn't who I want to be. Take it back. I don't want it. Take it back! Sorry, David. There are some things we can never come back from. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [country music playing] ♪ ♪ No, no, no, no, no, no. No. Not like this. Not while he still has my daughter. Hey, keep your hands off me and stand behind the yellow line. Turn this damn bus around. This bus is going straight to Purgatory. Listen, you can drive me all the way to hell if you want but not until I know my daughter's safe. Hell isn't on his route. But I know some other ways of getting there, if you're interested. Who are you? I'll give you a clue. I used to be an old friend of your boss. You know, I don't know how you can stand working for that guy. God's too busy doing God knows what and only has time to talk to the Pope? Me, I'm always listening. Can you save my daughter? Why should I? I'll give you my soul. [giggles] Huh? A priest's eternal soul for a girl's life. Pass. Look, I can always use another priest on my team, but Enos is one of my top earners. I'm gonna need a little more. That's all I have left to give. Sorry, Father. No deal. Then why are you here? Mm. [giggles] You know, I like riding on the bus every once in a while. Something 'bout the smell of diesel, it just... It relaxes me. I always heard the Devil was the betting type. Used to be a gambler like you. I'm listening. Give me one day. Just one more day of life to try to save my daughter. Whether I win or lose, you still keep my soul either way. Pass. A lot can happen in 24 hours. Come on, you know how this works. The house only takes a bet when it knows for sure it'll win. So there's no chance. 12 hours. Without Abigail, we both know odds are a thousand to one I'll even make it to her. Pass. Damn it! [laughs] Well, Father, is that your final offer? 30 minutes. Come again? 30 minutes to try to save her and I'll serve you and Enos in hell till the end of time. [moans] [sobs] Maria. [whimpers] Dusty. I've seen things, Maria, a kind of darkness in people I didn't think I could ever explain. It would take over sometimes. Be honest... wasn't Dusty just a little too good to be true? You believed it because you wanted to feel loved. No. But I'll always love you, princess. [whimpers] Welcome home. Let's give 'em one hell of a show. Ahh! [screams] [haunting rock music]
