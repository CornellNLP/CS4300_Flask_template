 Bless me Father, for I have sinned. 
 Hmm. 
 How long has it been since your last confession? 
 Since I found out God isn't the only who answers prayers. 
 [exhales] 
 [chokes] 
 Do you have any idea how easy it would be for me to kill you right now? 
 How much I'd enjoy that? but he... he still has plans for you. 
 Tell Enos I won't back down. 
 When Enos gets through with you, you're gonna be begging for your death. 
 And it will come very soon, he promised me that. 
 I just wanted to make sure you spend your last precious moments thinking about all those innocent people who are going to suffer because of you. 
 By the way, how many Hail Marys for me to atone for having impure thoughts about a young girl? 
 A young girl like your daughter. 
 Reverend? 
 [chokes] 
 [giggles] 
 [coughs] 
 [gasps] 
 Where is he? 
 Where is he? 
 [ominous music] 
 The world is a savage place. 
 Sometimes, it only gives you two choices... 
 Kill or be killed. 
 Either way, you're damned. 
 David. 
 Hmm? 
 Can you hear me? [moans] Jesus, you had me scared. You've been out of it all night. That son of a bitch shot me full of something. Who? The Society of Sons cracker... Dean Parsing. [sighs] David, I thought you were possessed. I never seen anything like this before. He got in my head. He told me it was something called mother's milk. Oh, my God! What did I do? [sighs] Don't worry. I handled the Rev. Does Grace know? Is he okay? All right, can you drive? Yeah, why? Great, come on... I need you to get her out of here. Some place safe where the two of you can lay low for a while. Can you do that? Forget it. I'm going with you. No, not this time, David. I love you, but you're no warrior. What about you? I'm gonna show the Society of Sons what happens when you mess with my family. [Cross My Heart's "Wild Side"] ♪ ♪

♪ I want to walk on the wild side, oh ♪ Who the hell is Dean Parsing? I got into a situation with his father a long time ago. About what? And don't give me that Society of Sons, white power crap. It's more personal that that. It was over a woman. Claire... Grace's mom. Thought you said she was a one night stand. Is it any of your business what she was to me? It becomes my business when some white bread demon starts coming after me and my brother! Hey, I loved her, all right? And that didn't sit too well with Parsing. So what? So he had some history with Grace's mom. That just explains why he hates you, not why Enos is using him. I asked you a question. Jesus, it's like playing chess with you. Listen to me... You're not the only one trying to forget old wounds. There are things I'm not ready to talk about with you or Grace or anybody until I settle 'em with God first. All I'm asking for is a little faith. Have I steered you wrong yet? All it takes is once to get us all killed. [truck door slams] Mother's milk clouded your mind... made you do bad things and not even remember. Dean used it on Charlotte to get to me the same way he used me to get to Bledsoe. But if there was still hope for me, that meant there was hope for Charlotte too... maybe. You okay? My head feels strange. Why are they in a strip club? She told us to meet her here. Who? Worst bachelorette party I have ever been to. I hope her fiancé's out getting laid somewhere. [moans] Who's this. This is Grace, the Reverend's daughter. Listen to me... this is important. You promise you haven't shot up any more of that stuff? Oh, God. Please don't tell me this is some intervention. Only reason I haven't called my candy man yet is 'cause you promised you were bringing something even better. And I did... I swear. But, in return, I need a favor. A favor? My daddy says those are bad business. We need some place to hide out. So? You said you had the keys to your dad's lake house. Hmm. I thought you'd never ask. [sighs] Do I look like a backseat kinda girl to you? [rainfall] [distant thunder] You get a lot of visitors? No. Mostly keep to themselves. Help you with something? This is police business, Dusty. Stay out of it. Who are you? Neighbor. You know these people? I know you can't walk into someone's trailer without a court order. Ms. Abascal came to see me. She said she'd been having some kind of a dispute with a gentlemen named Trevor Montroe? Now he's gone missing. Pale looking fella... glasses. Sorry. I should see the other guy, right? Excuse me? That bump on your head looks like somebody nailed you pretty good. Now you're supposed to say, "You should see the other guy." Yeah, sure. Say it. You should see the other guy. What other guy? You just admitted to assault. Now I need the man's name. [phone rings] [groans] You hear from Ms. Abascal, tell her Sheriff Dickey'd like a word. Will do. I'll let you know as soon as I see her, Sheriff. Yes, Mr. Roberts? What'd she do now? ♪ So what's the situation, darling? ♪ 
♪ Have you made your mind up? ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ 'Cause I have no time to be sitting all alone ♪ 
♪ For something ♪ Is this it? Money may not buy you happiness, but it can get you a pretty sweet lake house. [birds chirping] What are you looking at? The stars. What stars? Beautiful. Whatever she's on... I hope you brought some for me. You can call it pretentious, but Daddy and his mistress... They call it home. Don't worry... he paid someone else to kill 'em. But, if it makes you feel any better, my head'll probably be up there too one of these days. I can still see the life in them. Uh, that's a little creepy, but... whatever. So, David tells me you were away for a long time. Rehab? Not exactly. Don't be shy about it. I've been through 'em all; rehab, psych ward, boarding school. I should go check on David. [grunts] So we're clear, I'm not big on sharing my toys. David's mine. I don't mean to cause any trouble. Oh, but girls like you never do. Look, I'm sorry. It's just that David... most guys don't care how messed up you are inside, as long as you still look like a prom queen. Aren't you tired of the men in your life always trying to change you. To improve you when you're already so perfect just the way you are? A&O taught me to accept myself for who I really am. Um, did you see that? See what? [chuckles] I think I need another drink. You want one? Charlotte, maybe you should slow down a little. You called me, remember? I'm the one doing you a favor. Now, uh, why don't we go upstairs and you can show me just how grateful you are? I'm ready for a taste of this new sh1t you brought. I lied. I didn't bring you anything. I knew this was a setup. Agh, damn it! I told you... it's not an intervention. I'm just trying to keep you safe for a while. You hypocrite! Where do you get off? It's 'cuzza her? Charlotte, I'm sorry. You wouldn't believe me if I told you what's really going on here. Oh, sweetie, see? That's where you got it twisted. I've known guys like you my whole life. [laughs] Hey, it's me. I need you to make a special delivery and put a rush on it. [exhales] The rumors about Tetra were true. She damned her soul 20 years ago. Became one of Enos' first followers on Sangolo. Now she swore to use her dark powers against him instead, but the devil isn't a man easily crossed. [exhales] [ominous music] They're headed to the lake house. You sure Gracie's safe with him after what happened last night? Whatever Dean put inside his head, David fought it, which means he saved your life too. You asked me to trust you. Well I've trusted David with my life more times than I can count. Anyway, this won't take long. He said Dean's place is right up through there. Sure you wanna go in there with me? This guy wants you dead. I'm trying hard to forget the man I was. Somebody threatens my daughter, I don't walk away. That's not gonna do any good against a demon. Maybe not. Sometimes, there's comfort in old habits. Does Gracie know you killed a man? [distant screaming] [wailing] You hear that? What? [screams] Maria! [gasps] You all right? Maria, what's wrong? [yelps] That noise. What noise? [screams] God! Is she okay? Uh, I don't know what happened. Honey, what can I do to help? [wind howls] [exhales] [wind howls] Poor thing. Was wondering when you'd finally show up. Dean will be so disappointed he missed you. He loves watching mother work. I told him the lake house can wait, [whimpers] No. How did David like mother's milk? A little kiss from my veins to his. Abigail... do someth... Abigail can't help you. Maria! She's the one making this hurt so bad. But I can make it all go away. Maria, what's wrong? If you just stop fighting and give me what we both want? Let me kill Abigail for you. That's right... you don't have to suffer anymore. It can all be over now if you just let go. Stay away. [growls] What did you say? Stay away. You guys all right? It's okay. Uh, it's okay! It's okay... I'll call 911. [Maria moans] [wind howls] I'll see you again very soon. And next time, I won't bother asking. [moans] I'm worried, I'm gonna go get a doctor. [Maria wails] Thank you. [gasps for air] What if the world stopped demanding and started listening to your demands? What if other people's mistakes didn't become your problems? What if there was a way to cut through all the noise in your life and find perfect peace and clarity? Now you can. The A&O Life Success Seminar... Cut through the noise and help you take life back. Maria. [sighs]. This doesn't change a thing between us. I want you out. Not until we can stop Dean and that thing from hurting anyone else. Who the hell was that back there? I used to hear stories back in hell about a mad demon called Javorsura. What? Story goes that her madness was contagious. Would drive crazy any other demons that get too close. Scrambles everything. Makes us powerless. Looks like the old lady must be the mad demon's new host. What are we supposed to do? You stay as far away from her as possible or you'll get us both killed. You okay? That woman is Dean Parsing's mother. They know where David is. We have to go to the lake house right now. I just tried Grace... she didn't answer. Then start praying we're not too late already. [engine starts] - [country music] [indistinct chatter] [bell rings] Something wrong with your lunch? No, it's fine. That's the longest I've ever seen anyone ever take finishing a plate of catfish. I wasn't as hungry as I thought. Thank you. The reverend wasn't there when I stopped by the church this morning. Any idea when he's coming back? It's about fixing the church or you need to confess? Actually, uh... Didn't know you were the religious type. Maybe I'm just trying to cover my bases. - That's not how it works. Then tell me what does. I used to think that God had all the power. Then how do you explain why the world's all messed up? The world is full of pain. No one has a monopoly on that. You have no idea what I've seen. I watched a man take my daughter's life right in front of me. I listened to her begging for mercy and there wasn't anything I could do about it. You don't blame God for that? Every day, but believe me... Be very careful what you worship. Hey, Tetra, we got orders stacking up back here. I'm talking with a customer! Well he's not the only customer we got! I'll tell the reverend you're looking for him. Grace. Who's there? You okay? I feel strange. Like... nevermind. It's okay. Tell me. Like the world's trying to show me something. Wanna lie down? No. I like talking to you. Sorry about Charlotte. It's not her fault. She's just... I don't know. She's not used to not getting her way. She your girlfriend? We bring out the bad in each other, so I guess that's a sort of bond. David... what happened last night? There's just been some trouble... that's all. Something with my father? Yeah. He doesn't tell me anything. He keeps treating me like the kid I was ten years ago. I guess that's just the way he still remembers you. What about you? Well, I like the way you are now. [romantic music] [indistinct chanting] Gracie. I shouldn't have done that. No. [car noise] Who's that? [ominous music] ♪ ♪ David! David! The Candyman's here. That was fast. Oh, man, am I glad to see you. Oh, baby, you missed me, didn't you? [moans] Maybe I did. This, uh, too much? Or not enough? Ah. You need to go. What does he want? Don't worry about it. I can help you. No, this is my mess. Go up to the trophy room, grab a rifle, and lock the door. Go. Hmm. Hey, pal. All the right faces in all the right places, huh? I warned you, Dean. Hey, hey, hey. Ditch the hostility, brother. I forgive you. Cold feet, happens sometimes. Where'd your girlfriend go? Whatever Bledsoe did, she had no part of it. Oh, but she's a very big part in this. You both are. [gasps] Where's Grace? [indistinct chanting] What are you doing to him? Hey! Leave him alone! Tell me where Grace is. Please stop! I can tell you where she is if you promise to let him go! Don't listen to her. [chokes] [laughs] You know, I'm no doctor but that did not sound too good. Just please, stop hurting him! [inhales] David! [gasps for air] 
 
 [indistinct whispers] [gasps] [giggles] Welcome back, brother. Yeah, the redhead thought she'd try playing hero. I had to give her something to shut her up. Don't hurt them. You should have thought about that before you let that black b*st*rd go. What's this about? You didn't tell her? [giggles] He was supposed to kill your... Shut up! No. You still don't get it, do you? This isn't just about me avenging my father's murder. This is about you and your father. He wants you back, Davey. I'm never going back to him. What is he talking about? Killing Bledsoe isn't your initiation  into the Society of Sons. It's your initiation back to the Order of Everlasting. [panicked breathes] That's the job he gave me. And now you're going to do your job. [indistinct chanting] [voices chanting] Or, for every hour the Reverend is still alive,  I'm going to slice another inch across her pretty throat. That give you what, Davey? Maybe three hours until I reach her jugular... yeah? Starting right now! I'll kill you! [grunts] You will not hurt her. I will. Oh, come back, Gracie! Stop! [indistinct chanting] No! Come back Gracie! [indistinct chanting] Come on! Gracie! Where you going, girl? [cocks shotgun] [gasps] [groans] [inhales] [growls] Oh, I'm gonna chop that girl right in half. [screams] Dean! [gunshot] The flesh is broken, spirit lives. The flesh is broken, spirit lives. The flesh is broken, spirit lives. Gracie! Oh, my God. They're already here. Gracie! [slams door] Charlotte. Maria! Gracie! David! Are you all right? I took care of it. She's okay. She's okay! Thought I'd lost you again. You okay? Where are they? I took care of it. I shot that son of a bitch. Dean? Yeah. Where? He's in the lake. Please, let's just get out of here. No, no we can't leave. Not yet. The host may be dead, but the demon isn't. That thing's still out there. Abigail has to destroy it. What are you talking about? Evil. We gotta go. This'll have to wait. We gotta go now. Come on, go with David. Get in the car, sweetheart. Charlotte, come on. Come with me. Who are you people? Come on, Charlotte! Get in the car. Fun's over, Charlotte! Your Daddy warned you to stay out of here. For $500 a week, I don't mind being Robert's errand boy, but if I have to keep cleaning up after Daddy's little girl too, I'm gonna need a raise. I'm gonna go check around back. Hey, Jessie. Tell your guys they can go home... finish up tomorrow. You heard the man. Pack it up, boys. You need to go get yourself cleaned up. Don't worry about me. I can handle myself. We're gonna be okay. What going on? [sighs] The less you know, the better. Sheriff came by. They're looking for that guy. What did he say? Look, I don't want this blowing back on you. Maybe I should just come forward. No, no. Listen to me. Nothing's gonna happen. I won't let it. Excuse me. Can someone please give me a ride home. Can... can you? Yeah. Come on. I'll give you a lift. [breathes deeply] [crying] [knocks] Gracie. Something's happening to me. It's okay. Ah, baby... it's okay. [sighs] You're home now. You're home now. You're safe. [sobs] [sniffs] Nowhere is safe anymore. Come here. [kisses] No more hiding. We need to take the fight to them. What you need is to calm down. I'm not afraid of them! I took out Dean! I can take whatever's next. Guess maybe I'm more warrior than you thought. All you did is kill a host. It stopped him! Didn't it? For now, but that demon's still out there and so's his mother. Then I'll kill all the Sons if I have to! Stop! You're not thinking clear. Get it together! We can't start taking innocent lives. Dean and his mother aren't innocent. They asked for their demons. But the rest of the Sons might be under her control... Same way they used you and Charlotte. She called mother's milk a kiss from her veins. The demon's blood. That's how they're injecting her madness into people. Then we take out Momma Parsing and this all goes away. I don't know if Abigail can. Whatever happens next... Look, there's something that I need to know and don't lie to me. How did Mom really die? You already know. Car ran off the road, flipped in the river. Please, I don't need you to protect me. I just need to know. Why are you asking me this now? When I went back to our old house, I saw something. How's Gracie? She coulda been killed. Hey... I saved her life. After you and your girlfriend led that maniac straight to her. What is your problem with me? The rush you're feeling from pulling that trigger... That's not real courage. You know all about that. Stop it, both of you. This is exactly what they want; for us to turn on each other. We've got bigger problems on the way. Ms. Roberts! You out here? Sheriff? You oughta come over here. Drug deal gone bad? Society of Sons. That's their uniform. There's no way I'm sticking my neck out for Roberts on this one. Those are real bad people. Call it in. [radio feedback] The more you care about someone, the deeper you sink trying to hold on to them. It's human nature, not wanting to let go. Even for the most inhuman of people. That's him. [sighs] Oh, my precious Dean. What did they do to your beautiful body. [wind rushes] Why is it so hard to let go, Mommy? It's okay, Dean. You'll always have a place inside me. [wind howls] [inhales] [vomits] [gags] You okay? Oh, God. [spits] How much do you know about those two? Not much, I guess. Do you know what they do? Try to get by like anyone else. [siren chirps] Not like anybody I know. Get around, don't you neighbor? [indistinct radio chatter] Need to have a word with Ms. Roberts. Is there a problem, Rick? That's what we're gonna find out. Why don't you park yourself over there while I talk to the lady. Yes, sir. [indistinct radio chatter] You're mixed up with some dangerous people, Ms. Roberts. This handsome devil was affiliated with a criminal supremacist group. Your junky friend and his sister seem to attract a lot of trouble. No one wants this to land on you, but I can't protect you unless you help me first. Tell me what happened. We'll put these people away, you can go back to your life bangin' pool boys and giving the help something to gossip about. [indistinct radio chatter] What's it gonna be, Charlotte? Hey, Rev. We got company. Don't make a move 'til I say so. I'll be right back. We needa settle this, Bledsoe. We're giving you a chance to resolve this peacefully. Peaceful is what you call attacking my church and threatening my family. [chuckles] Peaceful compared to what's coming next. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ See, Dean wanted you dead, but I'm a different man than he was. Join us, Reverend. [car doors shut] ♪ ♪ You're out of your damn mind. We don't need your life, just your soul and we'll leave your daughter be. Otherwise, we're giving you fair warning. [inhales] [snickers] [ominous music] What are you doing? You need to take Grace and get out of here while you still can! I'm not leaving! I told you. A man can't keep running away. I can't protect you this time. I'm not asking for you to! Elijah, no! Don't do it. If it'll save Grace. Are you insane? Believe me... it won't,  no matter what the devil promises. My church, my call! I'll trade my soul for Grace if I have to. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] Do we have a deal? The Rev wants you to stay here. ♪ ♪ I stand before you unarmed and I'm prepared to answer for the violence of my past. [laughs] And show the devil's speech. You want my soul? Come get it. You'll have to go through me first. You gonna kill all of us, Maria? It doesn't have to be this way. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ What the hell? I didn't know there'd be so many of 'em. I should be out there with him. No. [wind howls] [yelps] She's here. It's a setup! Grace! [bangs on door] No need to fear, child. Old Lanie hurt you... But I will. Dean? [laughs] Just like I told you, Davey. We're practically brothers, remember? Just like family. And this family always sticks together. You people think you can just take my son's life? And murder my father? You have to pay! [electric whip] Let's make her hurt, Mom. Get away from her! [electric whip] [yells] Daddy! This looks familiar. [groans] Do you think you're going to protect her  like you did her whore mother? She wasn't a whore. Stop! What was that, dear? I couldn't hear you with all the noise. [wind howls] Yes, she needs you. Maria! No, Gracie, come back here! [heavenly music] ♪ ♪ [gasps] What's happening? Who are you? [screams] [yells] [grunts] Aah! [grunts] [screams] [growls] [ethereal whine] [breathes heavily] With the mad demon destroyed, her power over the Sons faded like a bad dream, and with nothing else to control their ignorance and hatred, the Sons of Society scattered like the flock of cowards they really were. Stay away from me. If I could bring your husband back, I would. I was a different man back then. Don't you dare try to comfort me. You took everything from me. I have nothing left. Just kill me, too. Please. I know you want to. No. If there's one thing we can learn from death, it's the value of our own lives. I'm very sorry. What's happening to me? Whatever it is, hell is trying awfully hard to stop it. [sighs] I just don't know if any of this is real. Oh, believe me, it's all very real. I like talking to you, Tetra. Like the mother I never had. Can I speak to you outside? How do you know so much? Knowledge I've paid a heavy price for. What was that? What is that power she has? A power that she must take after her mother. She has a spirit inside her you cannot imagine. What are you saying? I'm saying something very dark is coming  and she may be the only hope we have to stop it. [humming]
