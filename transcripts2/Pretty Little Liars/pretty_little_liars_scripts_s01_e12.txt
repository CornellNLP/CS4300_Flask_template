 Narrator :  Previously on  Pretty Little Liars : 
 Hanna : I saw him in the woods. He left an A message. 
 Aria : What did you see? 
 Enough. 
 Noel Kahn is A. 
 Don't say anything to anyone. Promise me. 
 You're keeping some kind of secret. 
 I'm gay. 
 Why didn't she tell us? 
 She was afraid. 
 Pam : This is what she's afraid of. 
 Lucas, I am being honest. 
 I have a boyfriend. 
 I think you deserve a better boyfriend. 
 Wilden : Somebody decided to pay a visit to Alisors memorial. 
 Mom, this is Alex Santiago. 
 Good serve. 
 Veronica : From the club. 
 I'm the last Potter. 
 When I go, that's the end of the line. 
 We're married. 
 Spence, what just happened? 
 Spencer : Who wrote that? 
 What's on there? 
 Get it off. Wipe it off. 
 Aria : Han, easy. 
 Hanna : Get it off me. 
 Why are you taking that off? 
 I'm not. I'm trying to keep it on. 
 I don't wanna see the autograph under it. 
 We can get you another sticker. 
 This time, why don't you try something mellower, like "save the planet"? 
 There were not a lot of choices, okay? 
 It was either Humpty Dumpty or "Jesus is coming, look busy." 
 Oh, God, it's still there. 
 Hanna. Hanna, don't, okay? 
 Don't look at that. Just look around you. 
 Because you're safe, you're home and you're alive. 
 Yeah, well, I thought I was safe in my hospital room too. 
 Now, what's going on with Noel Kahn? Is he A? Have you talked to him? 
 No, I avoid him. I keep telling him I'm busy. 
 Busy freaking out every time I look at him. 
 Yeah, well, try being run over by him. 
 Who got you this panda? Sean? 
 Lucas. 
 Oh, sweet. 
 Anyone else starving or is it just me? 
 Your mom said she left a special dinner for you. 
 Pass. No, I want a Pop-Tart. 
 What? I've been on hospital food for three weeks. 
 I want something that doesn't look like it's been chewed. 
 Well, why don't you eat while we go get the rest of your stuff, okay? 
 [BOXES CLATTER AND HANNA SIGHS] 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 Hanna? Hey, so if you're gonna stay down here tonight, then we're... 
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Down here's good. 
 What happened? 
 Hanna : Nothing. 
 Just, uh, knocked a few boxes down. 
 Well... 
 No, no, no. You don't have to clean. You can go. 
 Seriously, my mom's gonna be here soon. 
 Wait. So now you want us to leave? 
 You don't have to put on a brave face for us. 
 We get it. If being alone is freaking you out... 
 ...we can absolutely stay... 
 No, no, no. I'm just... I'm fuzzy. 
 And I think it's from this pain medication. 
 Yeah, I need a nap. Okay, can we help you to the couch? 
 No. You have done enough. Seriously, you guys, go. 
 Okay. Call me? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Yeah, me too. Any time. 
 You know you have to boil that first, right? 
 Yeah. Heh. 
 [CELL PHONE BEEPS] 
 So do you like? I could go back and get the one with the built-in heating pad. 
 Okay, what happened to the no-spending zone? 
 Honey, you are gonna be on the couch a lot. 
 You should at least be comfortable. 
 Last month, we could barely afford basic cable and bubble bath, and now you're... 
 I told you, things are better now. The bank loan came through. 
 In a lasagna box? 
 I see you had time to go exploring while I was out. 
 Mom, there are thousands of dollars in there. 
 Hanna, we were days away from a foreclosure. 
 Where'd it come from? 
 The bank. 
 It is a loan. Unauthorized. 
 Yeah, but what does that mean? 
 Just what I said. 
 I borrowed it from a customer who will never know it was borrowed. 
 It'll be replaced by the end of the year. 
 So you stole it? 
 Listen to me. 
 This is our lifeline. I was able to get our mortgage current. 
 What's left in this box is our cushion. And I will pay it all back. 
 All of it. 
 How? 
 Mom? 
 I never intended for you to know about it. That's why I hid it. 
 I figured a box that's been sitting there untouched for 10 years... 
 ...was safer than my old makeup bag. My mistake. 
 This is my problem. You just worry about getting better, okay? 
 Okay. I'm gonna take a shower. 
 I like these sausages. Are they chicken? 
 No, they're turkey. 
 So does your friend have any allergies? 
 What? 
 Is there anything I should know about what Maya eats? 
 No. She eats everything. 
 Dad, I know I asked for it, but if Mom can't handle this dinner tonight, I'll tell Maya... 
 We're looking forward to it. Your mother was up all night preparing the menu. 
 You don't think she'll try and poison her, do you? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Your mother? It's not her style. She kills with kindness. 
 Get in. 
 I can't. 
 My mom will be out any second... 
 ...and she won't believe you came all this way just for coffee. 
 Well, I didn't. I came for the kiss. 
 Oh. 
 Let's do this later? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 No, honey, leave the boxes there for now. 
 Do not call her. It's their honeymoon. 
 Okay. Bye. 
 What's going on? 
 Lan had all his boxes delivered this morning from his storage unit. 
 It couldn't wait till they got back? 
 I'm guessing he and Melissa probably wanna get a jumpstart on settling in. 
 Why are you so shocked? 
 Because you're not. 
 You and Dad are acting as if you're okay with this whole elopement thing. 
 You don't think this was rushed? 
 Of course it's rushed. It's outrageous. 
 I'm not dancing a jig over it, but what's done is done. 
 And a long engagement doesn't guarantee wedded bliss. 
 Oh, honey, would you hold this? I'm buzzing. 
 Oh, speak of the devil. 
 Lan? 
 Mm. Melissa. 
 Another picture. 
 The honeymooners. 
 Where are they? 
 Looks like that mall near Dad's office. 
 Well, I guess when you're in love, you can be anywhere. 
 You don't think it's weird? 
 Melissa trading in her princess gown and pink champagne for a food court Slurpee? 
 Spencer, you were a big part of your sister's rough year. 
 Maybe you could just be happy for her. 
 Spencer : Why is he out of jail? 
 He's out on bail. He's probably meeting with his attorney. 
 Honey, you'll be late. 
 And staring at him won't make him disappear. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 Maybe we should just give her one book at a time. 
 Hanna doesn't really do well with stacks. Unless they're catalogs. 
 Emily : Hi, Maya. 
 Hey, there. 
 Are you still coming for dinner tonight? 
 Sure, if your folks still want me to. 
 What should I wear? 
 Anything. Doesrt matter. 
 A dress. 
 A dress? Heh. Seriously? 
 Is this some sort of formal thingy? 
 Or are you just worried my jeans are too butch? 
 Don't say things like that, please, okay? They're not... They won't laugh. 
 Well, I'll see you guys later. So have fun tonight. 
 But FYI, if you decide to wear jeans, iron them. 
 Maya : Emily? 
 Are you still into this dinner? 
 Of course. I just... 
 My parents have been acting strange since I told them about me. Us. 
 Define strange. 
 Whispering, closing doors, changing the channel when  Ellen  comes on. 
 Got it. I will wear the girliest dress I own. 
 I'll tell them I sewed it myself. 
 Maya, this isn't a joke. My mom isn't your mom, okay? 
 Gatsby was more than just a pretty face. 
 He was ambitious, ruthless, charming. 
 And the themes of change and loss are central to both novels. 
 Did everybody get their papers back? 
 [BELL RINGS] 
 Perfect. See you Wednesday. Oh, chapters one and four. 
 No study guides, please. Read the man, not the blogger. 
 You guys go ahead. I'll get Hanna's assignment and meet up with you. 
 I know who wrote that message on your car. 
 It was Noel Kahn. 
 He admitted it was stupid. He was just angry and jealous. 
 Yeah, I get why he did it. Who else knows? 
 Nobody. Nobody else knows. 
 Look, and he's not gonna tell anyone. 
 How do you know that? 
 Because I think he may have known about us for a while now. 
 If he was trying to hurt us, he would have said something a long time ago. 
 Okay, he promised he'd just forget what he saw. 
 Look, let's not talk about this here. 
 Can I come to your place later? 
 I'm just not sure I wanna be there. 
 It'll be fine. 
 Just make sure Maya doesn't do all the talking. 
 If she starts going over a cliff, you grab the wheel. 
 Spencer, Emily. Wait up. 
 Just found out Hanna's mom's got some bank thingy in Scranton... 
 ...and won't be home till really late. So I wanna do a surprise party. 
 Welcome home, Hanna. We love you with or without your spleen. 
 I've checked with Mr. Hanna and Sean is totally down with it. 
 They didn't take out her spleen. 
 Really? Oh. 
 Then I'll just change the theme. 
 Mona, I'm really not sure Hanna's up to hosting a bunch of people at a party. 
 Oh, please. She's been socializing with IV bags and bedpans. 
 She'll love it. If you guys don't wanna come, I'm sure she'll understand. 
 Noel : Mr. Fitz? 
 Got a second? 
 Uh, sure. What's up, Noel? 
 Wanted to talk to you about something. These comments on my paper. 
 Pretty harsh. 
 Oh, I wasrt trying to be. 
 I worked really hard on this. 
 I'm sure you did, but you clearly hadrt read all of the material. 
 I think I know enough to get a better grade than this. 
 What are you asking me to do, Noel? Change the grade? 
 Because that's not gonna happen. 
 Mr. Fitz, you don't want me to bring the principal into this, do you? 
 Take another read. You may have second thoughts. 
 I think it deserves this: Hey, there. 
 Turns out there's this surprise party for Hanna, so I'm thinking... 
 ...um, I'll just go there first and then... 
 You're not coming over. 
 Why? What happened? 
 I had a visit from your friend Noel. 
 Turns out he's not too good at keeping promises. 
 In fact, he's not at all who you think he is. 
 Did he say something to you? 
 He... 
 Ezra. 
 Hey. Tell me what happened. Maybe I can fix it. 
 Jenna : Mr. Fitz? 
 What can I do for you, Jenna? 
 Mr. Mazarra said you need to sign my absence card. 
 Sure. Let me... Let me get a pen. 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 Alex : Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, I'm sorry. Practice ran late. 
 What's this? 
 A member of the club gave it to me. It's a tennis clinic in Sweden. 
 Sweden? Why did he give it to you? 
 He wants me to apply. 
 A lot of people who go end up playing in the Swedish Open. 
 God, Alex, that's amazing. You have to do it. 
 Maybe I could get an internship in Stockholm. 
 Spencer, slow down. I'm not going. 
 Why? 
 If this guy recommended you, he must think you're up to it. 
 I think you're up to it. You're fantastic. 
 I can't go. 
 I told my uncle I'd work for him. He needs the bodies. 
 Oh, your uncle can find other bodies to help him rip down buildings. 
 This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
 I don't wanna go. 
 So you'd rather spend the rest of your summer... 
 ...tossing broken plaster in a Dumpster? 
 That's insane. 
 Maybe to you. 
 I'm not interested in playing pro. 
 I'd rather be here working, saving for college. 
 Okay, I get that, and that's good, but how can you turn this down? 
 Like this: So you ready? 
 So where in Texas will you be stationed? 
 Fort Hood. But I'm not leaving just yet. 
 Here you go. 
 Oh, um, no, thank you. 
 I don't eat seafood. 
 It's not a moral thing. I get hives. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. Emily said that you could eat anything, so... 
 I forgot. Sorry. 
 It's okay. Um... 
 I'm really sorry. 
 It's all right. It's fine. 
 WAYNE : Are both your folks from California, Maya? 
 Yeah. They met in Berkeley at a "No Nukes" rally. 
 After my brother and I came along, they got married... 
 ...and we moved to San Jose. 
 You were already here when your parents got married? 
 I was the flower girl. Heh. 
 Oh, um, I guess they wanted to make sure it was real before they tied the knot. 
 Two children wasrt real enough? 
 Um, tell the story of how your dad asked your mom. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 So my dad's this raging, crazy romantic. 
 He proposed to my mom with a Sharpie. 
 Oh, he didn't have a ring, so he drew one on her finger with a felt pen. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Very clever placeholder. 
 No, that's the only one she's ever had. 
 Once the ink wore off, she retraced it with a tattoo. 
 Wow. See, now, why didn't I think of that? 
 Excuse me while I check on the roast. 
 And honey, be careful. 
 Our anniversary is coming up. I'm gonna invest in some felt-tip markers. 
 [WAYNE & GIRLS LAUGHING] 
 [SOBBING] 
 So where you going after this? 
 What are you talking about? 
 When my mom told me you were gonna give up Friday night... 
 ...to help me study math... 
 I never said math. 
 I said I would get you up to speed. So can we discuss Claudia Rice? 
 I don't know who that is. 
 Yes, you do. Skinny, skinny jeans. 
 Wort wear anything unless it's tight enough to make blood come out her ears. 
 Whoa, what was that? 
 What was what? 
 I just saw a shadow at your door. 
 No, wait. Mona, don't open the door. Call the police. 
 Oh, hush, Baby Jane. 
 Mona, don't. 
 All : Surprise! 
 [ALL CHEERING AND LAUGHING] 
 [ALL CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] 
 Noel, what are you doing? Please, don't open that. 
 Jackpot. 
 
 
 
 That's it, Noel, we're over. 
 What? 
 Happy now? 
 What happened? 
 I just put Noel Kahn back on the market. 
 How? You broke them up? 
 We broke them up. Arert you still crushing on him, Aria? 
 What did we do, Alison? 
 What's with the 'tude, guys? 
 I did it for Aria. 
 I only kill when we need food. 
 Or when I'm bored. 
 [LUCAS SPEAKING IN SPANISH] 
 Hey, Lucas. Long time no talk. 
 How are you? 
 Thirsty. 
 You can have your own cup. 
 So were you surprised? 
 Yeah, I still am. 
 Did you get my emails? 
 Yeah, I got them. 
 You know, I'm behind in every class, so if you wanna study together... 
 I'm kind of off studying at the moment. Been there, done that. 
 This semester, I plan to go from honor roll to toilet roll. 
 What is this? 
 Yeah, I would slow down on that. 
 Mona made that, so there might be a li... 
 I'm fine, Mom. 
 I'm not driving and this isn't my first time playing "Margaritaville." Want some? 
 Hanna-Ban. Where's that photo of you and me at the lake? 
 The one where we won the chicken fight. 
 Yeah, I don't remember, Sean. LUCAS: Sure, you do. 
 It's you and Sean. 
 [YELLING] 
 Me Tarzan, you Jane Austen. 
 You got a problem? 
 No. Mm-mm. Just amusing myself. 
 Did I embarrass you? 
 Sorry about the shrimp thing. Had I eaten that, I would've blown up. 
 Stop. They really liked you. 
 Dad was definitely hooked and Mom loved the dress. 
 Wait till she sees the crease in my jeans. 
 [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
 Wanna change before we go to Hanna's? 
 Would it be okay if I bailed on that? I'm exhausted. I didn't sleep last night. 
 I was way too nervous. 
 About dinner? 
 When I saw you at school, you were... 
 One of us had to hold it together. 
 You were one buckle short of a straitjacket. 
 I didn't mean to interrupt. 
 I just wanted to make sure and give Maya something to take to her folks. 
 Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Enjoy. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, thanks. 
 Here you go. 
 So, um, I was thinking. 
 My parents have this little place up in Bucks County. 
 What if we could sneak away up there next weekend? 
 Please, just don't say no until I at least show you a picture. 
 You had me at "I was thinking." 
 What just happened? 
 Nothing. I just... 
 Just a little bit busy here. 
 Well, let's go outside. 
 Okay. I'll meet you out there. 
 I'm just gonna go upstairs and use the bathroom. 
 Okay. 
 There you are. Where you been? 
 Sean got this amazing picture of Hanna. 
 When we surprised her, she might have peed herself. Classic. 
 You broke your promise. 
 You promised me you'd forget what you saw in Mr. Fitz's car... 
 ...but you're not letting it go. 
 Back up. What are we talking about? 
 You know exactly what I'm talking about. Okay? 
 And you can't just blackmail... 
 Blackmail? 
 Is that what he said? 
 You never demanded a better grade? 
 I didn't demand anything. 
 I asked him to take a second look at my essay. 
 Havert you ever worked hard... 
 ...and thought you deserved better than you got? 
 Wow. If that's the story he put out, you gotta wonder who this guy is. 
 Noel, is there something else going on here? 
 Is there some grudge you got against me and my friends? 
 Noel, come check this out. 
 Pritzker's got this video of the Barracuda game. 
 It's your shining moment, dude. 
 Noel : Hey, hey, what's up? 
 Did Jenna tell you I tried to reach you? 
 When you were still in jail. 
 No. 
 Well, I did. 
 I wanted you to know that I wasrt the one. 
 I never told the police where you were. 
 I gotta go. 
 Where? 
 There's a party at Hanna's. 
 Lucky you. 
 I can barely leave my porch. 
 But that's okay. I don't get many invitations. 
 Just death threats. 
 Do you believe me? 
 That's what I asked you before the cops picked me up. 
 I never got an answer either. 
 [KIDS LAUGHING AND CHATTERING] 
 Aria : Hey. Hold still. 
 Look, would you be cool if I left a little early, like now? 
 Where you going? Hot faculty party? 
 It was a joke. 
 Was it? 
 Aria. 
 No, it bothers you. Me and Ezra. 
 I can... I can tell by the way you're looking at me. 
 I mean, come on, it's not like things aren't different now. 
 Parties like this must feel like you're babysitting. 
 What? I don't feel like that at all. 
 I never should've never told you guys. 
 You should've told us a long time ago, when it started. 
 This whole time I was helping you get over this Viking boy in Iceland... 
 ...who, turns out, doesn't exist. 
 I thought we were close. We tell each other everything. 
 I couldn't. Okay? I swore to Ezra that he could trust me. 
 Well, we trusted you too. 
 Right. 
 And now I've blown it with everyone. 
 It took forever to get into that bathroom. 
 Mona was spending quality time with her eyebrows. 
 Hey, what's wrong? 
 I'm gonna take off. 
 Why? Where are we going? 
 I don't know what you're doing, but I'm going home. 
 Couldrt resist, could you? 
 What am I looking at? 
 An emailed confirmation of my application to the tennis clinic. 
 Okay. 
 Which was sent in electronically. 
 You think I did that? 
 You're the only person I told. 
 Yeah, but I didn't. 
 Get real. 
 You and I want different things. 
 You say you're okay with that, but you never will be. 
 I did not send that in, but I apologize if I made you feel you... 
 Don't apologize for who you are and what you want. 
 I'm not going to. 
 [CELL PHONE BEEPS] 
 SEAN : And she's all like: Now Hanna's on top of the bunny hill... 
 ...but I had to hypnotize her to get her to grab on to the rope. 
 Okay, I was freezing. 
 You were freaked. 
 No, Sean, my eyelashes were cracking off. 
 She says to me: [QUIVERING] 
"Sean, can you carry me down, please?" 
 And I'm like, "Babe, I'm right next to you. You'll be fine." 
 Oh, her trusty Saint Bernard. 
 "Snowplow the whole way down." 
 "And if you fall, I'll drag you back to the bus... 
 ...and get you drunk so I can lick your face." 
 What did you say? LUCAS: So what if they're lousy guard dogs? 
 They're big and they're goofy. If you can get past the buckets of drool... 
 I think Hermie the hermaphrodite needs a jumbo coffee. 
 Who does not want a big slobbering beast who can catch a ball in the end zone? 
 That's it. 
 Hanna : No, don't! Stop. 
 Fight, fight, fight. 
 Hanna : Don't hit him. 
 Sean, Sean, stop. It's like fighting a kid that needs a telethon. 
 Lucas, can I please talk to you outside? 
 What's his deal? 
 Lucas, did you come here to welcome me home or to pick a fight with Sean? 
 It's not my fault some people are trapped between Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon. 
 He is not the one that you're angry at. You came here to get back at me. 
 Breaking news, princess: Not everything is about you. 
 Well, then why'd you cut me off? 
 I wasrt the one who did the cutting. 
 I want to be your friend, Lucas, but... 
 No. 
 You people think you can push me around like some mop. 
 You're no different. You're no different from the rest of Alisors anointed. 
 What? 
 You let her march around... 
 ...and act like some 17th-century torture squad. 
 Lucas... 
 Considering what that bitch did to me... 
 ...I should have done way worse to her. 
 What are you talking about? 
 What did you do to Alison? 
 Dying doesn't make you a saint. 
 Not when you spent all of junior high being a monster. 
 Do you know what it's like to walk through this town every single day... 
 ...and look at some shrine to her? 
 That was you who destroyed the memorial? 
 You can call the cops. 
 Tell them to meet me at my driveway. It'll take me 11 minutes to walk home. 
 Lucas, I'm not gonna call the cops. 
 I think that we can keep this between us. 
 You've already been through enough. 
 Don't. Stop. 
 Please. 
 Don't make me like you. 
 It's too hard. 
 Is he gone? 
 I mean, you shouldn't be alone with him. That kid is cracked. 
 Yeah, well, anyone can surprise you. 
 Who we talking about? 
 You and Noel are best buds, right? 
 How well do you really know him? 
 Oh, I get it. 
 Your friend's a certified Looney Tune, so now you wanna pick on mine. 
 Sean. 
 Everyone's got a life that no one else knows about. 
 Who is Noel when he's not with you? 
 Hanna, you're freaking me out. 
 Why don't you just come inside and try to have some fun? 
 You know, people are asking... 
 You know what? Tell them to go home. 
 Okay? 
 Just want everyone to go home. 
 You need to call Alex. 
 And tell him what? 
 I can't undo this without telling him about A. 
 Unless I should go into the kitchen and ask A to put down the piece of pizza... 
 ...and call Alex himself. 
 Stop. 
 We don't know that Noel is that person. 
 And besides, I'm not even sure what A wants anymore. Are you? 
 You know what happens when you stick four lobsters in a tank... 
 ...and cut off their food supply? 
 They start to eat each other. 
 Can I get to the bathroom? 
 Is there a magic password? 
 Okay, if we find out that he is who we think he is... 
 ...then what are we prepared to do about it? 
 You hungry? 
 No. 
 You never told me that Emily tried to talk to me. 
 Why would I? What can she say now that's gonna make it better? 
 She wasrt the one that turned me in. 
 I know that. 
 How? 
 Because I did. 
 Toby, if you're running around like you're some kind of fugitive... 
 ...how are you gonna prove you're innocent? 
 You need to be home. 
 Where you're safe. 
 You could chain me to this porch and I'd still never touch you like that again. 
 Who do you think you're talking to? 
 [CLATTERING NEARBY] 
 Hello? 
 Is someone there? 
 Hello? 
 Is someone upstairs? 
 [GASPS] 
 Damn it. 
 Oh, God. 
 What happened in here? 
 I thought that someone was in here. 
 Yeah. Looks like a lot more than someone. You had a party? 
 Mona invited people over. I had no idea. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Hi. 
 How was the party? 
 Uh, just okay. 
 Hanna wasrt really in the party mode. 
 Well, can you blame her? 
 That girl doesn't need any more surprises for at least a couple years, right? 
 Is Dad sleeping? 
 You know what? After you left, he got a phone call. 
 The commander wants him in Texas by the end of the month. 
 This month? Why? He just got home. 
 I know. Emily, it's not his decision. There's just a bigger picture. 
 Tonight meant a lot to me. 
 Thank you. 
 Maya had a great time. 
 Your father thinks she's very sweet. 
 She is. 
 And I'm glad you're okay with it. 
 I'm not okay with it. 
 The whole thing makes me sick. Sick to my stomach. 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Hey, Spence. 
 Didrt even know you were here. 
 Would've watched the game downstairs with you. 
 Your mother makes me watch it on mute. 
 Just got home. 
 He's got a lot of stuff, lan. 
 Heh. 
 Yeah. Suddenly he's everywhere, isn't he? 
 Well, maybe it'll inspire your sister to finish that condo so they can move in. 
 Dad, they might never move out of here. Melissa loves the barn. 
 Yeah, well, Melissa's always needed a little nudge every once in a while. 
 That's why your mother thinks lan is good for her. 
 He's impulsive and passionate. 
 You don't agree? 
 I have a few other choice words I would reserve for lan... 
 ...but if I start listing them, I'll never fall asleep. 
 Oh, uh... 
 I spoke to a friend of mine on the police force tonight. 
 The bloodstain they found on that sweater at Toby's was a positive match. 
 Don't think that kid will be around much longer to scare you. 
 It's Alisors blood? 
 Does that mean it's done? 
 They're not going to investigate anyone else? 
 I thought you'd be relieved. 
 Don't stay up too late, okay? 
 My God, I missed you guys so much. 
 Why are you so tanned? 
 How did you get so sun-kissed sitting in your grandma's apartment? 
 I thought she was bed-ridden in a cave. 
 Doesrt mean I was. 
 We still on for tonight? 
 Totally. Spence's mom said we could use their barn. 
 Yeah, but there might be a major storm tonight, so... 
 It's the last blowout before school starts, Han. Don't bring me down. 
 Hey, can one of you guys get those? My arms are sore. 
 Yeah. 
 Hanna : Why? 
 Did you have to lift your grandma and bathe her? 
 Yeah, it was really disgusting. 
 Did you go to Hilton Head? 
 Oh, yeah. Nana had a day out and she's really into golf. 
 Don't ask. So, uh, who's in charge of refreshments? 
 Oh, Hanna stole a bottle of tequila. 
 Alison : Genius. Good job, Han. 
 Hold onto those baggy sweaters. 
 Spencer : Isn't Hilton Head in South Carolina? 
 I thought your grandma lived in Georgia. 
 It's still the South, Spence. Why so many questions? 
 We've got a long night ahead of us. 
 I can't spill every detail the minute I hit the curb. 
 Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it. 
 PETER : Spence, don't forget to turn off the yard lights, okay? 
 Maybe I should call Sean. 
 Maybe he saw somebody... 
 Don't... 
 ...talk anymore. 
 Please. 
 Will any of those help you sleep? 
 Pink one. 
 Will any of them help me sleep? 
 Thank you. 
 I'll get your bed ready. 
 Mom... 
 Take your medicine. 
 Tomorrow's another day.
