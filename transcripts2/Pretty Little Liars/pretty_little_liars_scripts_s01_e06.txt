 Previously on Pretty Little Liars... 
 Check it out. 
 Hanna : It's Alison's color. 
 You cannot seriously think that a blind girl broke into my house. I didn't say that Jenna was alone. Let's not go to the Toby place, okay? Aria : You guys think her guide dog left behind his lipstick? Do you like the color? Uh-huh. She lives in this town. I have to see her. I have... Mike : Do you think they're gonna work this out? I really don't know. If you want me to answer any more questions,  let me get in the office and see what I can find. Psychotherapy. You're her therapist! Uh! You and I have very different ideas of what's friendly. - That's an angry serve. Hanna : If you want to take someone else to homecoming, Sean, you should. Why would I do that? It's not like I'd actually go with anyone else. Pretty. Who made that? Somebody from school. Well, whoever made it must like you a lot. Dude, you are so screwed. When this is all over, she's gonna get her diploma. You're gonna get a pink slip and an orange jumpsuit. How many of your friends did you tell? I didn't. 'Cause if "A" knows, I'm thinking "B" and "C" and everybody else does, too. ♪ Hey. What are you doing? An intervention. We brought takeout and rag mags. But you cannot have any of those until you get out of these sweats. What's wrong with these? Nothing... Except they're starting to graft to your skin. Well, they're comfy. So are mom jeans and platform flip-flops. Plus, how are we gonna help you choose a homecoming dress if you don't try some on for us? That's easy. I'm not going. What do you mean you're not going? You can't just not go. What are you doing instead? I don't know. I guess I'll just read these and then inhale a gallon of chunky monkey. Hey, look, cutting yourself off from the rest of your life is not gonna help your parents. And besides, they still might work it out. They're barely speaking to each other. People get angry. They blow up. Doesn't mean it's over. Emily, they didn't blow up over her dad missing their anniversary. He slept with one of his students. Sorry. I'm just saying things can look over on Friday, and by Monday all is forgiven. Some things just take time. Yeah, maybe. Okay, so you're coming! Come on! God... I'll think about it. If you're not coming, can you at least cast an absentee ballot? What? I need her vote. Hanna, stop already! You've got homecoming queen locked down. Really? You can rig the election? Sorry, I have enough to do already, thanks. I'm head of the committee, half of which is out sick with the flu, so I'll be restocking the ice and refilling the hummus bowl... And trying to look cute for my first official date. With Alex? Wait, you're bringing him to homecoming? So, this is real! Look at her blush! Stop! Damn! Now I have to come. Seriously, you guys, he's not gonna know anybody there, so can you just do your best to make him feel included? No, we were planning on freezing him out. All right, moving on. Em, who are you gonna bring? I think I'm gonna go stag. I will, too. Why don't you guys come together? Oh, you'd make such a cute couple. How did I just go from wearing mom jeans to being Samantha Ronson? ( Chuckles ) Who cares who anyone goes to this thing with? I mean, it's just a dance. You should bring someone who you have fun with. I might want to go with someone. I just don't want people thinking it means more than it does. Are you and Ben back together? No. No, of course not. So... who's the mystery dude? I'm starving. What's wrong? Bad fortune? Yeah, Confucius says stop being such a drama queen. "Lions and tigers and bitches, oh my! There's no place like homecoming. See you there. 'A.'" the pierces: * got a secret * * can you keep it? * * swear this one you'll save * * better lock it in your pocket * * taking this one to the grave * â* if I show you then I know you * * won't tell what I said * * 'cause two can keep a secret * * if one of them is dead * So, my parents are going out of town this weekend, and I thought maybe you could stay the night. I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I'm ready... to do it. Sean, I'm not ready. I made a commitment to myself... a commitment I want to honor. Good. Nice work, you guys. Sit down. May I have two other volunteers, please? Hanna. You wanna give it a go? No. See? I can say no. So can I. Get up. You can be the instigator. Lucas! Uh, no, I'm really more comfortable in an observational role during sexercise. Come on, you two. Let's go. ( Sighs ) So, you want to come up to my room? I can't do this. But you make me so hot. No, I mean, I can't do this with you. Girls like her don't approach guys like me unless they have deep-seated self-esteem issues and a serious drinking problem. Just play along, Lucas. Come on. This is embarrassing. Why? Because I don't need to know how to rebuff the advances of a genetic splice between Barbie and Shakira. It's just never gonna happen. The point of this is to be prepared for the situation when it does arise... Mr. Mazarra, let's look at the facts. I have the upper-body strength of screech, and I spend my weekends playing Wii... alone. I think my virginity is pretty well safeguarded. Both of you, start again. So, you wanna come up to my room? Yes. ( Chuckles ) ( Period bell rings ) Hey. Can I talk to you? No, I can't. I have a staff meeting. No, I just need... I'm late. Hey. Hey. Haven't seen you in a while. Yeah. Things have been kind of busy. Me and the girls have been working on the memorial for Alison. Oh, right. You going to homecoming? Um... I don't think so. Dance music isn't my thing. I'm not really gaga for gaga. So... maybe we should... try to catch up sometime? Yeah. We should. I have to go to class. Way to sneak up on people. Sorry. Look, can you get it today? Get what? Jenna's file. No. They canceled my shift at work. Well, go in anyway. It's a therapist's office. Pretend you're having a nervous breakdown. Well, if I lose the crown to Heather Perez, I won't have to pretend. Hanna, I'm serious. That file might be our only chance to find out what Jenna knows about that night, and if she and her creepy stepbrother are planning revenge... Spence, I'll get it. Why the panic attack? Is it because of the fortune cookie? It's because Toby Cavanaugh, who's never had a date in his life, just bought two tickets to homecoming. So, Jenna's coming, too. Well, they did promise to see us there, right? Hey, Hanna. Spencer. So, is it true you're taking the country club's towel boy to homecoming? His name is Alex, and yes, I am. Knock it off, Mona. What? I think it's cute she's taking her Cinderfella to the ball. Can you go get me a fro-yo with sprinkles? Wow, that was exactly the reaction I want to avoid. Don't pay any attention to her. She's just insecure. Yeah, like a pit bull. Why are you friends with her once you get to know her, she's really funny... And she's always there for me, even if it's just to watch me try on shoes. Look, she's a good person. She just talks tough so people will forget what a geek she used to be. Ow! Okay, you need to chillax, or I need to start carrying a tranq gun. Shh. What is that? Hi. Hey. I was about to look for you. You were? How come? Well, I wanted to talk to you about something. Um... Do you want to hang out tomorrow? Um, I would, but I can't. I'm going with my friends to homecoming. That's too bad. I... I was hoping maybe you'd go with me. To homecoming? Uh... I didn't think that was your scene. I have a scene? I didn't think listening to the Smiths alone in my room was a scene. You know what I mean. I think what you mean is that you don't want to go with me. No, it's not that. It's just... I would've thought you think homecoming is lame. It is pretty lame, but... You're not. Okay. So... I'll pick you up at 9:00. Sure... but it starts at 8:00. Lame. ♪ What you gonna do when your mom says no ♪ 
♪ but you gotta save pride and you gotta go? ♪ 
♪ I'm gonna have to run I'm gonna have to run ♪ 
♪ what, you think life can be put on hold? ♪ Hey, need any help? You're a little early. The dance doesn't start for 27 hours. But I wanted to do a dry run, test out the route, time myself door-to-door. You sound like me. Yeah, but... I was joking. Oh. I'm about to buy a suit, and I wanted to know what color your dress is so we can match. Oh! Don't bother. Look, I'll match my outfit to yours. Just wear whatever you have. Okay, we can't both show up in jeans and a t-shirt. You're sure that you want to? Yes, I want to. It's a good excuse to buy a suit, and, uh... here. What's that for? The tickets. No, don't worry about it. This is my treat. I just... I know how hard you work. I don't want you to spend your money on some stupid dance. Well, tough luck... 'Cause I want to. I'm wearing a silver strapless dress. Can't wait to see you in it. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Thank you so much, guys. Hi! Hey. I didn't know you were in a band. Jazz band. I don't march. And, yes, I'm voting for you. Thank you. Um... Okay, well, I'll see you at homecoming. I don't think so. Too bad. I know Emily really wanted you to come. Oh. Well, um... I'll think about it. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Were you talking to her? Who? Emily. Why are you doing this? What are you talking about? ( Scoffs ) You know you're only fooling yourself, right? I mean, once she finds out the truth about you, she'll hate you. Who's gonna tell her? Careful with that! Are you blind? Can we help you? What are you guys doing? Baking a cake! Well, are you gonna be done soon? No! Aria : How long did you wait? I finally left when chewy's five-'o-clock shadow turned into a beard. Did you tell Spencer? Relax. I rigged the door so we can get back inside later this weekend. Hey, do you have anything a little less hippie and a little more bourgie? Whatever's in there is what I have. Okay, so, what do you think? "It's an honor just to be nominated," or "it's about time. Where's my throne?" They both look good. Aria, I know what you're going through. When my parents were fighting, I barely left my room. I wore my headphones and blasted Jay-Z to drown them out. It got to the point where I'd only take them off to shower. Like, the worst part is now, waiting, which is why you need to get out of the house. We will have an amazing time tonight, and I know someone who has a huge crush on you. Who? Chris Buzzini. I thought he was bringing Lisa. He is, but he told Sean he'd rather take you. He just thinks you're not into him. Well, I'm... I'm not. So who are you into? Oh, my gosh, I knew it! You're already seeing someone. No! Yes, you met someone when you were living in Iceland. What's his name? Forget it. I probably can't pronounce it, anyways. Look, Aria, this guy may be cute and all, but that booty call is a long distance. It's time to say good-bye to your viking and move on. You're in two completely different places right now. Maybe you're right. Of course I am! So, what are you gonna wear, "the bell jar," or "let's get this party started"? ♪ For as long, long as I can remember ♪ 
♪ it's been December ♪ 
♪ no sun and no summertime to treasure ♪ 
♪ we weren't grown ♪ 
♪ and every time that they told us ♪ 
♪ "surrender, it will be better" ♪ 
♪ we'd just go holding on to forever ♪ 
♪ for what we know ♪ 
♪ broken lover ♪ 
♪ guess I made you ♪ 
♪ believe that I ♪ 
♪ would be the one to heal you ♪ 
♪ and if you go now ♪ 
♪ out that doorway ♪ Hi! There she is. I was worried you were gonna bail. No! No, I'm ready to have a fantastic time tonight. With no date? My, how the mighty have fallen. Whatever. She can share my date. Yeah. I have no problem with that. And mine. Yeah. Hey, I'm Aria. Alex. Nice to meet you. You too. Unfortunately, you have to work before you can play, 'cause you've got the first shift at the beanbag toss! You're a hero. Um, will you excuse me for just one sec? Yeah, sure. Talk to him. Yeah. It's good to see you, too. What are you doing here? Nice to see you, too, sis. No, seriously, what are you doing here? I was asked. The alumni has a former homecoming queen present the crown. Right, and this year it's some chick from the class of 2000. I'm filling in. Apparently she's been vomiting since Thursday. Great. Oh, by the way... they posted the winning Golden Orchid essays online, and I had a chance to read yours... or, should I say, mine? Look, I've already told mom and dad, and they think a retraction would be more of an embarrassment for us. It was a really stupid thing to do, and I'm so sorry... No, you're not. You never are. Hey, Trish. Ugh, that's awful! Is that Becky Newman? It looks like her hair got in a fight with her face and they both lost. Yearbook pictures! Hey. Hey. Nice bowtie. Oh, thanks. It's my grandpa's. Hey. I'm Lucas. Great. Can you be Lucas over there? ( Chuckles ) Um... I'll see you around, Hanna. Yeah, see you around. Have fun. 
 
 Rude much? Am I in a parallel universe, or did you just engage in conversation with Hermie... isn't that what Alison called him? He is not a hermaphrodite, okay? He's a nice guy. Saying hi to him's not a crime. It should be. You didn't bust your ass to become rosewood's "it girl" just to make chit-chat with shim. If you and I start slipping up, we're gonna be right back at the bottom again. Yeah, well, I'm starting to think I've lost a few things on the climb up. Look, you can go kamikaze if you want, but I will cut your rip cord before I let you drag me down with you. Hello? Hey. Hi, I'm Melissa, Spencer's sister. Alex. Nice to meet you. We've met. At the club. Are you on the homecoming committee, as well? Alex doesn't go here. He goes to school across town. Where do you go? P.S. 187 on Elmhurst. You wouldn't have heard of it, Melissa. It's not in the same zip code as the Prada outlet. Um, catering crisis. Bye. I didn't plan this. I already said I believe you. Yeah, but you don't. I do. Can you hand me those, please? Hey, nice haircut. Thanks. Great. Well done. I didn't tell anyone about us. Let's just drop this, okay? I'm just grateful it ended before one of us got seriously hurt. Too late for that. It wasn't a friend who sent that text. Hi. Oh, well, that's all right. You just missed it, but there you go. Have a good one, rest of your night. So... Who's "A"? It's someone who's messing with me. Aria, why would someone want to mess with you? Because last summer... I don't know. It's complicated. If you've had enough, I'd be happy to relieve you. Oh, thanks, Ms. Welch. I'm fine. I was talking to her. Oh, I've had enough. So, who's up? You know, they're showing a Fritz Lang double feature at Rosewood cinema tonight. If we leave now, we'll only miss the credits. I... might be a little overdressed. This may sound stupid, but I've never been to one of these things before. What are you so nervous about? Meeting up with my friends? Who think I'm a freak. Not all them. I mean, they'll get over it because they want me to be happy. It's just a party. You know, if we get hungry, we eat some chips, have some punch... Punch, really? Are we gonna jitterbug, too? You don't have to dance. Good, 'cause I... I don't. Okay, so how about you stand there and do this... and I'll dance around you. I think I'd rather drink the punch. Okay. Hey, that was a quick shift. You okay? No, my claustrophobia kicked in. Can you find someone to take my place? Yeah. Alone in a dark booth with Fitz? It's, like, every freshman girl's dream. Hey, Hanna. Hi! Hey. Hey. Um, have you guys seen Emily around? No, I was just about to text her. Don't bother. ( Song ends; Applause ) Hey, guys. I'll go get us some drinks. You're here with Toby? Either you've got some genius plan of sleeping with the enemy, or you've lost your mind! You don't even know him. Spencer : What is there to know? Who else could've helped Jenna? He has every reason to hate us. Well he doesn't. Emily, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a fricking duck. Wow. I thought at least you'd understand. Emily, wait. Why are you doing this? Aren't you the one who told me to follow my feelings and not to let other people's opinions stop me? Yes, yes, I did, but that was when I thought you were taking Maya. Maya?! Why would I take Maya? Hey. You wanna go play some games? Sure. Melissa : So, did you buy a raffle ticket yet? Not yet. Where's Spencer? Did she leave you all alone? It's cool. I like people-watching. I'm glad to hear that. I mean, most guys would be uncomfortable being... used like this, but if you're not, then no one's getting hurt. What are you talking about? I'm talking about Spencer, you know, dating you to piss off our dad. She's always trying something new to make him crazy. You really should buy a ticket. That is a beautiful car. Did I miss something? When did she start hanging out with Toby? I have no idea. I've never even seen her talk to him. There you are. You keep disappearing on us. Yeah, we... had to... get ice. Hey, wanna dance? Let's do it. What's wrong? Nothing. I'll be right back. Aria? I'm sorry. Can you come here? Please, Hanna. I'm sorry. I figured out what Toby's tattoo means. What? "901 free at last?" It's September 1st. That's the day Ali disappeared. Hanna, you've gotta get that file. Tonight? Emily's not going to believe us without proof. She could be walking into a trap. Could we do it after they announce the homecoming queen? Please. Okay, fine. Fine. I'll get it. Keep an eye on Emily until I get the file. Wait, what about me? Keep an eye on Sean. What? I can't exactly tell him where I'm going. If I make something up, he'll want to come with me. Just keep him busy. How am I supposed to do that? I don't know. Just figure it out. Come on. Spencer, wanna go to the fortune teller? Spencer. What? I asked if you wanted to go to the fortune teller. Um, no, I don't really think so. It's not really my kind of thing. You know, on second thought, it might be kind of fun. Sean, hey. Hey. Where's Hanna? Oh, she's with Spencer, getting some more ice. More? Is there a heat wave going on in here? Oh, right! Right, she actually said that there was... Uh, a crisis with the band or... Do you want some food? Hi, could I get a cab to Rosewood High School, please? Great. Thanks. Hey. The homecoming queen is leaving? Nominee, and yeah, sort of. Isn't that kind of like Han Solo abandoning the Millennium Falcon? Uh, honestly, I have no idea. Why are you leaving? Got enough photos for the yearbook. You came just to take photos? Yeah. And to cast my vote for you. Listen, um, I left a check for the band at the office where I work. Would you mind driving me there and back? It's either that or watch  the new hoarders episode with my parents, so yeah. Here, uh, you look cold. Thank you. Let's go. There's a lot of anxiety in these cards. Are you a worrier? Spencer? Hmm? Question. Yeah, I guess so. This indicates a journey. It's unclear whether it's a journey from the past or in the future, but I'm seeing an image. You could be taking care of someone. They could be... hurt. What else do they say? You know, this is typical Hanna. She makes a big deal about coming to this thing together, and then she ditches me. Let's dance. Come on. Come on, I love this song. You're not gonna leave me to bump and grind by myself, are you? I'll be back in a sec, okay? What did you tell Hanna about us? What are you talking about? Why did she think you'd be my date? I don't know. She came up to me. Shouldn't you be with your date? Don't make a big deal out of this. I'm not, you are, and I don't know why, since you've clearly moved on, anyway. I told you I needed space. Yeah, and I'm giving you space... To come to grips with who you are, not to hide it. I'm not hiding anything. Then look me in the eye and tell me you have no feelings for me... and I'll leave you alone for good. ♪ Let me down easy ♪ 
♪ but stay with me tonight ♪ 
♪ said you don't need me ♪ 
♪ but stay with me tonight ♪ 
♪ let me down easy ♪ 
♪ but stay with me tonight ♪ 
♪ tonight ♪ 
♪ said you don't need me ♪ When this card is reversed, it indicates something from which you are running away. The lovers is a joyful card, but paired with judgment, it means there's something wrong with this couple. It's a bad match. Here, there's darkness in him, maybe even violence or vengeance. Where did this come from? Ezra, wait! Just let me talk for a second, please. I don't want to argue or try to convince you... I know it's over, I know that! But... I just, I can't stand the idea of you walking around and hating me. Hate you? The only person I hate right now is myself for asking too much of you. Seeing you out there tonight, out on the dance floor, having fun with guys your own age, not sneaking around and holing up with me in my apartment to watch videos and eat one of the three things I can actually cook? Because... because I can't take you to the movies. I can't take you out to a nice restaurant, and for the record... I could never hate you. I figured you'd be here tonight. The new haircut wasn't to impress Mrs. Welch. I gotta go. Can you wait here? I'll only be a couple of minutes, okay? Oh, yeah, take your time. Hoarders always has, you know, two cases. You okay? You wanna talk about it? ( Revelers shouting ) Why don't we go upstairs to the chem lab? It's quiet up there. Alex : What's going on? You seem distracted. ( Phone ringing ) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I promise, this is the last time. The phone's not the problem. Maybe my work for the night's done. What do you mean? Just go ahead. Answer it. I'm sorry. I'll just be a minute. Sorry. What is it? Hey, I'm looking through the entire "M" section, and there's no Jenna Marshall. Well, check under Cavanaugh. She's Toby's stepsister. Maybe his dad adopted her. Hey, my phone's dying. What did you say? I said check under Cavanaugh! But what if the... Hanna! Where's Alex? He left. What do you mean? He left. Do you need me to tweet it to you? What did you say to him? I didn't have to say much. You screwed up this one all by yourself. It's so weird to be here at night. Wanna talk about what happened? I just got upset. Did it have to do with Maya? No. Yes. Emily... Did you come with the wrong person to homecoming? Maybe. I understand. Why do you like me? What? Why are you so nice to me when... when you know what me and my friends did? Oh. I guess it's because I've also done things that I'm not proud of. We've all got secrets, Emily. And don't forget to buy your raffle tickets for a chance to win a brand-new Toyota Corolla. That is one sweet ride. And now, for the reason we're all here. I can still remember the feeling of joy I had when, as a rosewood student, I heard my name called. Please welcome your new homecoming king and queen, Sean Ackard and Hanna Marin! Sean Ackard and Hanna Marin! Is that Jenna's file? No, I got Toby's. Turns out Jenna wasn't the patient. The therapist had her come in for one session to see how she felt about Toby coming back home. Oh, my God. Well, what else does it say? Well, the dates prove he wasn't away at school when Ali disappeared. He was still here in rosewood. What else? See for yourself. Session 12, August 15th. Think I didn't see what was going on in there? It's not what it looked like. Maybe not to you. What are you doing here, anyway? What the hell did I ever do to you? You've been peeping in my window for years. I never looked in your window. Well, I've looked in yours, and we're not taking the blame for this. Oh, yes, you are. No, not unless you want the entire world to know how close you are with your stepsister. You talk, and I'll make sure everybody knows you've been doing it with her. So that's what Ali had on him? It's enough to want her dead. And us. Emily! ( Phone ringing ) Can you please not answer that? Why? Because I'm trying to find a way to tell you about what happened last summer. ( Ringing ) I want you to hear it from me. She's not picking up. Text her! We have to find her. Come on! Toby, you're scaring me. Please stop. I haven't said anything yet. Please stop talking. So, you're allowed to be honest, but I'm not? ( Message tone beeps ) Who's that from? Is that from one of your friends? I've gotta go. Why? Wait. No, I've gotta go. Wait. Just hear me out! Somebody help me! Emily, wait! Where is she? Maybe they left. ( Sobbing ) Somebody help me, please! ( Chatter ) Emily : Get away from me! ( Gasps ) That's her. Somebody help! Somebody! Emily! Get away from me! Emily, wait! Somebody help me. Get away! Leave me alone! Aah! Aah!
