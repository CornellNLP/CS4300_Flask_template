 ??? "Pretty Little Liars"... 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Spencer got the tickets for me and ezra. 
 Please, just don't go tonight, okay? I have a bad feeling about this date. 
 I think that bad feeling is called jealousy. 
 They had a big opening at the philadelphia art museum. 
 You went last night? 
 Why is he out of jail? He's out on bail. 
 Why don't you save us the cost of a trial and drop dead! 
 You'll have to do more than break records if you wanna become team captain. 
 Who said I wanted to become captain? 
 What the hell?! 
 I take care of things myself. 
 You remember that phony your sister used to date? 
 Ian thomas? They partied that whole summer. 
 He's the poster boy from preppy. 
 Convincing, isn't he? 
 So you wanna give it back to your teacher Or put it on your charm bracelet? What is that? 
 It's what stopped mrs. Montgomery from getting to philly. 
 Who's this from? Paige. 
 She's trying to bribe her way to becoming the next team captain. 
 Do you think they're from the same place? 
 These two were purchased by a spencer hastings. 
 Does that help, dear? 
 Ah, so it's just gonna be you and your brother tonight, And he wants to order in from sausage heaven. 
 Again? Seriously? 
 Dad, the closest thing they have to a vegetable is a paper plate. 
 Listen, just tell mike that it's your night to pick, okay? 
 Okay. So you're definitely not eating with us? 
 Uh, no, no, I--I've got this thing. 
 It's with the head of the department, And dinner's included, so... 
 Have a great day, sweetheart. 
 Oh, hey, dad, I need your pledge for the dance marathon. 
 The deadline's today. 
 Oh. Oh, right. That's right. 
 Uh, my checkbook is in my jacket in the hall. 
 Did you find it? 
 What? 
 Um, yeah. 
 Great. 
 Dad, what's this? 
 Well, that's a ticket for the museum. 
 Is it yours? 
 No, no, it's, uh, it's your mother's. 
 Uh, her car broke down, And she needed to borrow mine to get there. 
 So she was at the museum on Thursday night? 
 Yeah. 
 I--I mean, I--I think so. 
 You know, actually, You should really just talk to your mom about that. 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 Is my chemistry book over there? 
 Uh, I don't see it. 
 It's probably in the room, spence, not the frontyard. 
 What happened to the cavanaughs' mailbox? Somebody hit it? 
 It's not the first time, and I'm sure it wasn't an accident. 
 Every time I come home, toby's out there cleaning up some new mess. 
 And please don't say he deserves it. 
 I wasn't gonna say that. 
 Is that it? 
 Thanks. 
 Do you still think that somebody framed him? 
 Toby? Do we really wanna have this fight right now? 
 I have to save up some of my energy for swim practice. 
 We're not on different sides anymore, em. 
 I mean, I know what it feels like to have somebody Say that you did something when you know that you didn't. 
 Are you talking about the bracelets? 
 I'd never seen that bead lady before that day, And yet she had my name written down on two sales receipts. 
 We should go. We're gonna be late. 
 I owe you an apology. 
 Seriously. U believed that he was innocent from day one, And I jumped down your throat. 
 I said some really heinous things about toby. 
 You shouold apologize to him, not me. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Cute boots. New? 
 Oh, ish. 
 What is with this line? 
 ( sighs ) all the vending machines are on lockdown. 
 Someone's been breaking into them after hours and stealing food. 
 I heard this one kid say the alarm went off at like 3:00 a.M. 
 What, the vending machines have alarms? 
 School. 
 Someone's been sneaking out of the building In the middle of the night, which makes zero sense. 
 Who'd wanna be here any longer than they have to? 
 Hmm, well, I might. Going home just got scary. 
 This was in my dad's coat. 
 He said it's my mom's, But I'm starting to wonder if he was at the museum, too. 
 Your dad? No. 
 Why was he so twitchy when I asked? 
 If they both were there the same night as me and ezra-- 
 Aria, you're just on a loop. 
 It was a coincidence. Is it? 
 Han, come on, you don't think it's weird that my mom had a ticket the same night? 
 Yes, a weird coincidence. 
 ( sighs ) 
 Um, can you get my coffee? I'll be right back. 
 Um... 
 We need to talk. 
 You know that thing you did with mrs. Montgomery's car? 
 Well, just pretend like it never happened, okay? 
 Don't talk about it, don't blog about it, don't tweet about it. Clear? 
 Can I speak now? 
 Okay, if you must, but it's really annoying. 
 The way I see it, you owe me. 
 For what? 
 For doing that thing I can't talk, blog, or tweet about. 
 ( scoffs ) 
 ( phone beeps ) 
 ♪ got a secret, can you keep it? ♪ 
♪ swear this one you'll save ♪ 
♪ better lock it in your pocket ♪ 
♪ taking this one to the grave ♪ 
♪ if I show you then I know you ♪ 
♪ won't tell what I said ♪ 
♪ 'cause two can keep a secret ♪ 
♪ if one of them is dead ♪ 
 Was there a second watch? Was anyone else keeping time? 
 It was a tie, paige. You and emily tied. 
 So what's gonna happen? Who gets to anchor tomorrow? 
 Can't make that decision yet. 
 All right, listen up, sharks. 
 We'll meet tomorrow morning, same place, same time, And have ourselves a little swim-off. 
 So, I guess we'll just figure this out tomorrow. 
 You figure it out. I need to win. 
 Aria. Hi, sweety. 
 Hey, mom. 
 Your ears must've been burning. 
 Why? 
 I was just talking to the principal about you and mr. Fitz. 
 Why? 
 Well, he wants to take your class To new york to see the fitzgerald show, But the principal told him there was no money. 
 Do you wanna walk with me? 
 Sure. 
 What's up? 
 So dad wrote me a check this morning for the dance marathon. 
 Okay. 
 And when I got to his checkbook, I found the ticket that was yours to the museum. 
 I guess it was in dad's car. 
 You didn't mention you borrowed his car. 
 Oh, no, well, I didn't think I had to. 
 Why, did you have it on reserve for the night? 
 No, I'm... I'm just confused. 
 Did you go to that exhibit or not? 
 Well, to be perfectly honest, no. 
 I skipped it, and I went out to a really nice dinner instead. 
 By yourself? 
 No, uh, I was with a friend. 
 I gotta get to class. 
 I'll see you later. 
 Are you reading that fast or fanning yourself? 
 What? Um, sorry. 
 Where you going? 
 Um, I left my lip gloss in the history stack. 
 Gotta find it. 
 ( clears throat ) 
 ( sighs ) what do you want? 
 I'm calling in your debt. 
 Two losers just bailed on what they owe me, And I need some cash right now. 
 Okay, so what do you want me to do? Bust their kneecaps? 
 I don't want an enforcer. 
 I want a date. 
 ( chuckles ) okay, absolutely not. 
 You're the homecoming queen, hanna. 
 You got a certain rep around here, and I need to borrow some of your cred. 
 What are you gonna do with it? 
 I need customers... With money... 
 Who need to know they can trust me. 
 Yeah, well, they can't. 
 They can if I'm with you. 
 So you got a hot party tomorrow night? 
 I have a swim meet. 
 You can fit all of that under a cap? 
 I'm not swimming, freak. I'm cheering on a friend. 
 ( bell rings ) 
 What is the point of a swim-off? 
 Why would the coach pit you against each other before a meet? 
 She's using our combined times to choose anchor, And right now, we're tied. 
 Well, you'll change that. 
 Maybe not. She wants it more. 
 Emily, you want it more,  And it is okay to admit that. 
 ( chuckles ) 
 You know who that's for, don't you? 
 Toby? 
 What are you doing? 
 I might be interested. 
 Spencer, don't. You can't. Why not? 
 Because you'd be going there for the wrong reason. 
 Really? Well, what if the same person Who gave my name to the bead lady Is the one who framed toby? 
 What if that was "a"? 
 Can't you find that out some other way? Without asking him? 
 Who else knows what he knows, emily? 
 If I can get him to talk-- 
 You won't even get him to look at you. 
 He doesn't trust us. 
 He doesn't trust anyone anymore. 
 Maybe, but if I have one piece Of the puzzle and he has another, Then we can put it together and maybe help each other. 
 ( knock at door ) 
 Hey. You're a little early. 
 I just wanted to tell you I'm not coming to practice today. 
 Why not? I have another commitment. 
 You know, why don't you come in. Close the door. 
 I can't stay. I'm-- 
 No, come in. 
 ( door closes ) 
 What are you trying to pull here, spencer? 
 Are you gonna tell your parents you can't stand to be On the same field with me so you're quitting the team? 
 I'm not quitting the team. I just have this other thing. 
 You can't avoid me. 
 I live in your backyard. 
 Well, this isn't about you. I'm... 
 Look, I'm too concentrated in athletics, And it doesn't look good on my college applications. 
 So I just need to balance out my schedule. 
 Knock-knock. Hey. 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 I thought you had a marketing seminar. 
 Oh, the professor cancelled. I brought the tile samples. 
 The contractor needs a decision. Oh, great. 
 Bye. 
 Yeah, I think your sister's quitting the team. 
 Why? I'm not quitting the team. 
 I'm just doing some tutoring. 
 Well, anyone in particular? 
 Toby cavanaugh. 
 What? What? 
 I signed up to help him with his french. 
 I can't believe the school would let anyone near him, especially alone. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 I already told you. 
 What is this really about? 
 That kid murdered one of your best friends. 
 Wait, don't tell me you're falling for that silent martyr crap. 
 Okay, you can't believe a thing that creep says. 
 Well, toby cavanaugh hasn't cornered the market on lying. 
 I better to go. 
 Hi. 
 I--I noticed this was on the ground As I was walking up. 
 Wait, I'm here to tutor you. 
 Someone from the school called to tell you, didn't they? 
 Why you? 
 Because I'm in a.P. French... 
 And I volunteered. 
 Look, I have all your assignments together, And I worked out a schedule for the rest of the semester. 
 If we meet for three times a week, we can-- 
 You can't come in. 
 Jenna's home. 
 Okay. 
 Well, is there somewhere else we can go? 
 I--I can't go somewhere else. 
 Well, will jenna mind if we sit out here on the porch? 
 Just don't think about it. It'll make you crazy. 
 How am I supposed to not think about it? 
 It's too freaky. If my mom's car hadn't stalled-- 
 Well, it did. 
 Don't look a gift card in the mouth. 
 The universe gave you a pass. 
 That's not the universe I know. 
 Well, look, it all worked out, okay, and that's what counts. 
 Maybe the universe got a little help from someone-- 
 Someone with really good intentions. 
 Shh. 
 That's great. I can pick you up. 
 I can find you in the dark. I've done it before. 
 Okay, I'll see you soon. Bye. 
 ( phone beeps ) 
 Hey. 
 So you're not going to that department dinner anymore? 
 Oh, no, no. 
 Was that mom you were talking to? 
 Uh, no, no, no, it wasn't. 
 So you sure you guys are gonna be okay here alone tonight? 
 Sure. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, look, aria, even if it wasn't the universe-- 
 Shh. 
 ( door shuts ) 
 I'm just saying if it's not a coincidence, then maybe-- 
 Come on. Where are we going? 
 To follow my dad. Where? 
 If I knew that, we wouldn't have to follow him. Aria... 
 Han, my dad's about to have dinner with somebody in the dark. Move it. 
 I brought you something. 
 L'attrape-coeurs. 
 The heartcatcher? 
 It's catcher in the rye. I guess there's no literal translation, But it helps to read a book you already know in english. How do you know I've read it? I saw you once... At the apple rose grille. You were reading it. What are you doing here? Uh, mr. Carinci wants you to review The conditional tense and the workbook-- What do you want? What makes you think that I want something? Because you never do anything without a reason. Did emily tell you that? Nobody had to tell me that. I think maybe you're being framed. What changed your mind? I think somebody might be trying to do the same thing to me. Maybe the same person. How's that feel? Not good. Scary. Why would somebody go after you? What makes you so important? I don't know. Maybe you know something you're not supposed to know. Well, every time I think I know something, I get the rug pulled out from under me, and I end up on my ass. C'est dommage. ( speaking french ) I'm sorry... For what I said about you And what I thought. The sweater with alison's blood... You said that you gave it to her that night. I did. And then she got into a car. With some guy. I couldn't see who it was. I'm not supposed to talk about this. Do you know how the sweater could've gotten back into your house? ( bang ) Uh, I have to go. Thanks for the book. Yeah, you're welcome. ( zips bag ) What are your thoughts on genetic modification? Aren't scientists playing god? How will it affect human health in the long term? So I'm against it. He's different. How? I meant, he's different than I thought he would be. "how have humans altered the genomes of species for thousands of years?" Through artificial selection. There's something about him that's... I don't know. Wow. A question spencer hastings can't answer? Interesting. It's not that interesting. Am I finished with your homework? You are. Thank you. 
 
 ( sighs ) I keep trying to find a connection. To toby? To alison and toby. Me and toby. We're pretty sure he didn't do it, right? And yet somebody found a way to make him look extremely guilty. Spence, you can't figure all that out Sitting on his porch, conjugating verbs. Well, you don't know what those verbs are. If he didn't tell you the first time, he probably can't. Are you sure he even wants you to come back? Yeah, I think he does. Why is my dad walking into our high school? Okay, weird. Not really. I mean, think about it. He's probably just going to see your mom. Em, that's ridiculous. People lie, aria. I mean, hello? Well, what are they doing? Call your mother. Huh? Right now. Call your mom. ( phone dialing ) ( phone ringing ) Ella : Hi, aria, honey. I was just thinking about you. Is everything okay? Yeah. Why wouldn't it be okay? Uh, well, I didn't mean to suggest That everything wasn't okay. I was just asking, checking, wondering,  Like moms do. Where are you? Home. Shh. Where are you? Home. Okay, so everything's okay then? Yeah. Okay, I'll talk to you later, sweetie. Bye-bye. Bye. 
( sighs ) Okay, well, she says she's home. Do you believe her? I don't know. What are you doing? ( door shuts ) ( sighs ) ( sighs ) That's not good. Mm. What? You used to like it. No, no, not that, this-- The lying, the sneaking around. I feel like a teenager. Yeah, it's fun, isn't it? Byron : Listen, we should  just . We can't. We can't tell them until we know what this is. ( sighs ) Okay, I think I got everything. Let's go. Watch out for that. Oh, my god, my parents are having an affair with each other! Hanna? Hanna? What are you doing? Come up here. Hurry! What are you looking at? This. Someone sending a bunch of texts? Spencer's laptop disappearing? Our lockers broken into? All this stuff happened at school. This is "a." Let's just get out of here. Come on. Hanna, you're taking that? Yes, "a" owes me-- Hospital bills, pain and suffering, Tire marks on my cleavage. It's--it's nothing. The lights are probably on a timer. ( bang ) We should go. ( both scream ) Come on! ( screams ) ( screams ) Caleb? ( groans ) How's your eye? Any better? It's still burning. You want a sharp stick for the other one? It was just hair spray. It was light hold. What were you doing in there anyway? I'm sort of, um... I'm crashing here. You are? Why? What do you care? Don't snap at her like that. I have more. Fire away. Just give me my money back first. Where do your parents think you are? ( chuckles ) My foster parents don't care where I am... As long as they keep getting their checks. Wait, I thought all that stuff About the social worker was a joke. Believe me, my social worker is a joke, But, yeah, I do have one. This is crazy. You can't keep staying here. Why? There's hot water, vending machines, The principal's couch is pretty comfortable. Well, they know someone was here last night. Yeah. I got sloppy. Where are you going? Grab some dinner, then back to bed. You know your way out, right? ( thunderclap ) ( rain falling ) ( thunderclap ) ( phone beeps) ( thunderclap ) Paige? Are you okay? No. What happened? ( chuckles ) You have every reason to hate me. I don't even know why I'm here. I don't hate you. I would. I do. Don't say that. I'm sorry, emily. I just wanted you to know that. Wait, paige... ( thunderclap ) ( thunderclap ) Good morning, sharks. How we all doing today? All : Ready to swim, coach! I'm sorry, I can't hear you. All : Ready to swim, coach! That's what I'm talking about, all right. It's our last practice before this afternoon's big meet, So let's make it a good one. Oh, emily, there's not gonna be a swim-off. I just got word that paige will not be joining us. Why not? She had an accident while riding her bike last night. She's just a little banged-up. She'll be back swimming in no time. Okay, ladies, in the water, in the water! Come on! You're late. Let's go in. Wait, can we talk about last night? What is there to talk about? Um, the fact that you're hiding out In the a.V. Closet until graduation. What's your plan? All right, do you wanna play guidance counselor Or do you wanna pay off your debt? I'm cashing in on that favor. Point out the kids who have money to burn. Fine, I'll trade you-- One name for one answer. Oh, hey, bridget. Hey, hanna. You know my friend caleb, right? Sort of. Hey. Bridget wu-- total party girl. Bring her a bottle of something strong, And she's your new best friend. Where are you from? A lot of places. I gave details. ( sighs ) Seattle, salt lake, denver, chicago, and here. Your turn. Lindsay hoover. Don't let the jesus sandals fool you. She's got cash. Her grandfather invented the stapler. Nice. Wana get tight with her? Grow a hipster 'stache and start talking about "the man." Why don't you report your foster parents? To who? My social worker? I've had four in the last six months. They can't remember my name. The last one called me "calvin." When's the last time you saw your real parents? It's gonna take a lot more than names to hear about them. ( cheering ) ( laughing ) Truce. Got you a button. Thanks. No problem. I need to be super rah-rah now that I'm the coach's wife. It's a swim meet. It's not even his sport. And what's yours, brother-in-law bashing? What's going on between you and ian? Why don't you ask him? Something wrong with that picture? I see my husband buying us hot dogs, And I see you going out of your way to humiliate him. What was that lying crack about? He does nothing but try with you, spencer. When are you gonna give him a break? Honestly? When I figure out why he rushed back to rosewood And rushed into proposing to you. No, you've got it wrong. I proposed. I wanted to elope. You have a problem with my marriage, you take it up with me, not him. Well, him is the problem. He's not been entirely honest with you, and I'm worried about you. About what? You have to ask him about alison, About what happened the summer that she was killed. ( laughs ) you really are too much. Did toby cavanaugh put that idea in your head? Hey. Sorry I took so long. They were out of the spicy mustard you like. ( chuckles ) Did I miss something? No, we were just talking about alison. Ian, I'll meet you inside. Okay. Look, I've already lost one relationship because of you. You will not ruin my marriage, too. Melissa. Coming. ( cheering ) When's emily gonna jump in? She's the anchor. She swims last 'cause she's the fastest. Hey, remind me, which one's lindsay and which one's bridget? Bridget's the one drinking from her purse. Thanks. I'll be right back. Girl : Come on, come on, come on! Why are we sitting with caleb? Why not? Hanna, I like stray dogs, too, but sometimes they bite. Well, he's had his shots. Go, emily! She's not swimming yet. ( cheering ) ♪ ( cheering ) ( cheering ) You know what? I'm gonna take the long way home. Okay, I'll see you later. Bye. ( phone beeps ) What's this? My eviction notice. Sorry. You know that I didn't tell anybody. I didn't go there. Well, maybe it's for the best. I mean, I hated that shirt anyway.Osets. ( sighs ) Consider your debt paid. Have a good day. Hey, if you need a place to stay-- No, thanks. Your mom starts asking questions, Someone calls social services, and it's just a big mess. Wait. There's an old couch in my basement. My mom will never know. Hanna. Hey. Here you are. You're not gonna believe what this sick freak did now. What are you talking about? Look. I have to say, "a" is smart-- Trying to pit us against each other. Yeah, aria-- it's relentless. Every time we shut a door, "a" kicks open a window. I gave your mom the museum ticket. What? Why would you do that? "a" made me do it. 
"a" has something one. "a" has something on all of us, hanna, But there's nothing "a" could threaten me with that would make me do that to you. You're supposed to be my best friend. I know, and as soon as I put the ticket in your mom's mailbox, I did everything I could to undo it. The reason your mom didn't get-- Stop talking. There's nothing you could say That would change the way I feel right now. You okay? You didn't return any of my calls. I'm fine. It's nothing. I didn't know what to say. I was riding home on my bike and totally wiped out. What were you thinking about? How easy thing's would be if I wiped out. I'm kind of done with swimming. Yeah, I used to feel that way. Obviously you got over it. How did you get over it? I started swimming for myself. I quit trying be better than everyone on the team, and I just relaxed. Sounds fun. When's the last time you swam for fun? ♪ Hey. Hi, I got your message, But I didn't totally understand. This isn't going to work. Here, take it back. Toby, I came here because I thought that we could help each other. We can't. Just take it and go. ♪ ( phone rings ) ( phone beeps ) ( sighs ) Caleb : Question. What's up? Um, the towels in the bathroom-- Are they like the fancy people-are-coming-over towels? No, you can use them. I don't have to. I can shake off and air dry. Please don't. What's going on? You want me to leave? It's not about you. Aria's really, really mad at me. You know that thing I told you not to leak? She found out anyway? She's never gonna speak to me again. You don't have to sit here and listen to this. Just go take your shower. It can wait. Good night. Wait, spencer. Can we talk about earlier? No. It's late, and I'm tired. I know about you and ian. He told me everything-- The thing you two had when we were broken up. I can't hold that against you. Did he tell you anything else about that summer? Whatever it is you're holding onto, It's got to stop. I think he's dangerous. And I think you need help. You keep wanting what I have. You know what, melissa? Spencer, I don't want to fight. I realize that I lost my temper earlier, and I'm sorry. I've been a little hormonal lately, And I guess I should tell you. Tell me what? We're pregnant. This is where you say, "congratulations." Good night, sis. For families, friends, civic groups or clubs. By listening to these long-playing, hi-fidelity records, You can speak fluently in as little as six weeks. We're going to start with the french verb etre, Which means "to be." Ready? Let's begin. Pret? Commencons.
