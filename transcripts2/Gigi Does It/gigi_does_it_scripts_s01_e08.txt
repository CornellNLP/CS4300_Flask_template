 It's been six months and six days since my Harold died, which means it's been six months and five days since I had s*x. 
 What can I say? 
 Lucky for me, he died with an erection. 
 Now, I know in my heart of hearts no one could replace him. 
 He was like no other. 
 He was the best husband I ever had. 
 But the new Gigi needs a new man, someone sophisticated, someone classy. 
 Like a male version of Hugh Grant. 
 So, I signed up for speed dating, which is like regular dating except sped up. 
 So, I guess they get right down to the s*x. 
 I signed up Ricky, as well, 'cause that poor thing could at least use an over-the-pant hand job.

Very nice to meet you. You, too. So, how ya doin'? So, you havin' fun? Gigi : a**l. I've never had it, but I love the idea of it. Why don't you try it? I'm worried it might break me. You can try it with a dildo. I had a dildo once, and I used it to beat my children. Put your finger right there. Put my finger here? Yeah. 'Cause I don't-- That's how you start letting someone in, by a touch. You have cold hands. Yeah, it's a bit chilly. Yeah, my mom had very cold fingers, but she was dead inside.

Um, I'd love if you'd call, and maybe we could do dinner tomorrow night? Call me. I, uh, I will. Okay. Nice to meet you, Ricky.  (Chuckles) Nice to meet you, Sarah.  (Chuckles) ♪ Hey. Hi. I have, like, a sore on my tongue. I wonder if it's from shaking one of these creep's hands. I met someone. What? I met a girl tonight. You-you-you m-- you met-- you met a-a girl-- a girl?

Thank you very much. ♪ Ricky : Just stop me if you've heard this one,  but, uh, where did the pedophile train stop? Oh, I don't know. Where? At the mo-le-station. (Laughter) Oh... Your-your smile could-could stop wars. (Laughter) I would just love to rip that off your face and send it to the Middle East and be like, "Hey, listen up." Aww. "Her smile is here." Aww. (Sighs) ♪ Ooh. So, what's new, Gigi? Hmm? Tell me. What's new? Nothin' much. Same as ushe. You know, I go to the-- I go to the park. Yeah, I-I try to get out myself every once in a while.

Shoo-shoo-shoo. You shouldn't a done that. That's all right. You know, we coulda split it. Let's have s*x in the alleyway behind the restaurant. What? When? Now-- right now. Public s*x is thrilling.

No. Look, I talk a big game, but I-I'm slightly more conservative than I make myself out to be. D-don't get me wrong.

♪ you got the healing that I want ♪ No. No. No. Come on. What's wrong with you? Gigi : So, jumping into the dating world has taught me a valuable lesson.

Who makes me feel like the most bad-ass Jewish grandma that ever lived? Me. So, you wanna know what I want outta life? The answer is simple. (Panting) Me, myself, and $6.2 million, baby.
