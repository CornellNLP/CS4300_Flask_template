 (Clears throat) 
 So, uh-- 
 Yes. 
 Yeah. 
 So, you, uh... 
 Mrs. Rotblum, your late husband was a very frugal man. 
 Oh. 
 And he was able to maintain his personal financial holdings for almost 50 years, which is very impressive, uh, considering taxes and normal life expenses. 
 Well, we didn't live a normal life. 
 The man reused Toastees. 
 Ah. 
 He wore a ring around his pen1s to save sperm. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That's all right. 
 I don't mince words. 
 Never have. Never will. 
 I understand. 
 Uh, your husband had various unattended financial holdings. 
 Apparently, he was too sparing to hire an accountant to manage his portfolios. 
 (Scoffs) 
 For example, his investment in toilet paper is currently worth $12.34, which actually represents a gain. 
 And you've never seen a more delicate asshole. 
 And that's typical of his investment returns, except for one notable exception. 
 In 1964, he invested $50 in a company that provides food to zoos. 
 Zoo food? 
 Zoo food. 
 For the animals? 
 That's correct. 
 He loved animals. 
 Well, that's probably why he invested. 
 You know, they feed monkey meat t-to elephants. 
 Didn't know that. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, and they take 'em behind the scenes, you know, into their cages. Mm-Hmm. Yes. And they take the little ones. Um, what are they called? The tamarin monkeys, lion tamarins. Mm-Hmm. And they crack 'em, and they put 'em in a bushel, hundreds of them at a time, and the elephants just suck 'em up. Fascinating. Well, circle of life and so forth. Yeah, yeah. Mrs. Rotblum, your late husband's investment in this company is currently valued at $6.2 million. Since your husband was too frugal to hire someone to draft a last will and testament, Florida law dictates that his entire estate be turned over to the name of next of kin. Next of kin-- is that a Chinese name? No, that's you, Mrs. Rotblum. I'm Chinese? No, Gigi, you're next of kin, which means your estate is now worth $6.2 million. You're a multi-millionaire, Mrs. Rotblum. Congratulations. Can I get you water or anything? I could use a wipe. ♪ La la la la la ♪

Uh, th-they all seem like they're into polyamory, except for that, um, the goateed Canadian kid. Yeah, I-i could tell he didn't even love himself. He's perfect. Let's say you were to come into a lotta money. What's the first thing you would do with that money? I'd probably blow it all. I'd probably waste it, like, on a horse, or a wife, or somethin'. You're very honest. I like that about you-- Honest Gabe. Abe. Gay. It's Honest Abe. Are you gay? What? That's okay. No, no, I'm-I'm not. That's fine. You're hired. What? Really? You've got the job.

Just stay here and just be with me. I'm at work. Correct. All right. You want a lozenge? ♪ La la la la la la la ♪ 'Cause it looked like a bug, you know? And I went to squash it, and she said, "No, no, no, don't-don't touch it. That's a-- that's a mole." I said, "Oh, God." She said, "yeah, that's a basal cell carcinoma." Hmm. Can ya believe? She had cancer right in the middle of her forehead. Oh, that's terrible. Yeah, that was bad. What are you doing? Uh-- You're in there too long. You're gonna burn it.

That's for-for jellyfish sting, you know. The best thing for it is urine. I'm telling you-- go pee. Uh, here, uh-- Well, I don't have to pee. I do. You know, I've had anxiety issues my whole life, but I've never experienced them at this intensity before. Well, there's only one clear solution to rid me of my overwhelming insecurities, something sensible, something in tune with the nature of things and in line with the most common anti-anxiety treatments. I'm gonna purchase a deadly weapon. (Gunshot) Oh, what? You thought I was gonna say, "buy a cat?" (Bleep) cats. (Gunshot) 
 
 Gigi : Hello? Man : Hello. How are you doin'? How are you guys doin'? Gigi : How are you? Look at all these boom-boom-boom-booms. (Chuckles) My name is Gigi. Fred : I'm Fred. Fred. This is Corey. Corey. How are you? Okay, Corey. Ricky : Hey.  And you, sir? Ricky. And this is my new assistant. Nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you. Ricky. Yeah. Corey. Hey, Corey-- Ricky. Good to meet ya. (Gunshots fired in background) Well, I'd like to-- I very much would like to purchase a gun. Well, the easiest ones to operate are revolvers. Okay. And also, weight's gonna be a consideration-- how good it feels in your hand. Yeah, I have, you know, I have a little bit of arthritis, but it's okay. One-one way to explain it would be like trying on a pair of shoes. Okay. They either feel really good, or they don't feel comfortable at all. You see mine? These are mine. Orthopedic. Yeah. So, any comfort I think would help. Those are pretty stylish shoes. Thank you so much. We'll have to set you up with a gun to go along with it. They're a little dirty. See how that feels to you.   - Some kids in my neighborhood stomped on my feet. That feel heavy? Yeah, this is very, very heavy. This I can barely hold. Fred : Okay See? It's starting-- this is-- I-I'm starting to lose it. Naw, see? I can't lift it back up. Can you control it? Yeah-- yeah, yeah. There ya go. Sorry. Maybe something smaller. (Gunfire) I'd like something that can fit in my purse-- something I could fit in my brassiere or one of my, you know, this-this one is bigger than the other. That happens in nature sometimes. Gigi : Yeah, it's always been that way. Very unfortunate, but such is life. This one's a lot bigger, though, a lot bigger. (Fred laughs) Yeah, it's wild looking. Okay. This is-- a little more compact size, a lot lighter. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, a lot lighter. Remember Charles Bronson? Sure. In what is it? "Die hard?" "Death Wish." "Death"-- "Death Wish." Don't you come near me. (Gunshot fires in distance) You come closer, I'm gonna blow your brains out. You don't wanna kill 'em. You wanna stop the threat. Here I am. You were lookin' for me? Well, ya got me. Guess what. Boom. Right between the (Bleep) balls. I would highly recommend taking some training classes. (Gunshot firing) It's very loud. (Gunshot firing) Ricky : Yeah. Too loud! Yeah, it's probably too much for you. We should go. Any one of these nutcases can turn around and shoot me in the brain. I think you had your fun. Let's go. Ricky, I'm standing my ground. You wanna stay? You bet your little white ass I do. (Gunshot) You think you can rifle through my jewelry? (Gunshot) Smell my brassieres? (Gunshot) And wear my panty liner? (Gunshot) Gigi : Never! In grade school, I was bullied by a girl named Baruch Fishman. (Gunshot) You would think she would be the one that was bullied because her name was Baruch. But, no, she took it out on me. (Gunshots firing) Too late-- I'm the head of the class now. (Gunshot) Are you afraid? I'm afraid, too. (Gunshot) Afraid I can't help myself. I haven't felt this way in years. This is exactly what I was hoping to accomplish-- your brains on my carpet. (Gunshot) I'm the killer they call Gigi. (Gunshot) My uncle was a Jewish gangster. (Gunshot) Now, who's gonna clean this up? Not me. (Gunshot) I don't clean anymore. (Gunshot) I don't clean anymore! (Laughs, gunshot) I don't clean anymore! (Gunshots firing) I don't have to clean. (Laughs) Look. You killed it. Yes. Wait. Hello. Boom. (Laughs)  Come on, Gigi. I wanna buy this gun. I wanna buy that gun. Well, we'll think about it. No, because--   - And make sure you're making the right decision. I think that'll fit in my purse. No? Mm-Hmm. Yeah, can I try it? Fred : Sure. I would probably put it in like so. Do it like that. Oh, yeah, perfect. Look at that. Then, you clo-- it closes. Ta-da. I feel-- I feel invigorated, and I feel emancipated, and I feel inspired, and I'm wired, and I'm a little bit tired. I'm not gonna lie to ya. A little bit perspired, as well. Am I shvitzing? A little bit, yeah. Oh, all right. Yeah. Well, that was a lot for me. That was a lot for anybody. But, I think it went well, and now I have protection, which is very important. Gigi : Do you have my car keys? No, they're in your purse. Gigi : No, they're not. Yeah. Gigi : They're not in here.

You woulda killed me, and then your day would be filled with dealing with my death. I shot Ricky, but the doctor at the hospital said it was only a graze wound. Listen, I blame Ricky. If he had had a gun, he would've been able to prevent this from happening because you know what they say. The only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Don't be a negative Nellie. Be a positive Perry. What do you think of that? What I think, is that as long as you choose the gun and having gun for protection over having me work for you-- Yeah. Then, I can't do it. Oh. I can't work for you. The mayor of ultimatum land is either-or, Mr. Either-Or? What the hell business is it of yours what I do with the gun? Because when the gun is aimed at me, and I get hurt, that is my business. Yes, you think-- and as mayor of ultimatumville, it's me or the gun.

Leave me out here in the middle of hell, on the corner of despair and horror. Well, what am I gonna say? We lost the gun. We're sh1t outta luck. Yeah. We-- look, you know, it wasn't-- bad luck. It wasn't meant to be. It wasn't meant to be. What do you mean, "it wasn't meant to be?" These things happen. You know, these things happen. They're not supposed to happen, if you're responsible. And worse comes to worse-- Worse comes to worse, it could end up in somebody's hands, and they-they-they hurt somebody. Yeah, listen. Here's the best part. Now that the gun is gone, you can work for me. Come-- let's go home. You know what they say. Every time a gun is lost, an assistant keeps his job. ♪ (Wincing)  Ahh. Ahh. Okay, okay. Ahh, that's too much pressure. Okay. Well, it's swelling. Yeah, no, but, that-- you-you just dab it. I'm dabbing. Oh, look at that.

And now, I have, like, an inverted lump that presses against my right prefrontal cortex, which is probably why I suffer bouts of depression. No, that's-that's definitely-- that's medically impossible. (Sighs) You know what? It's been a long day. I'm just gonna go. Well, wait a second. All right. Okay. How's that? Okay. All right. Yep, I'm gonna go. You're leaving? Yep. Very good-- good-- great day at-- Great day at work, huh? I'm very proud of you. You and I make a great team. Wouldn't you agree? (Sighs)  Yeah.

And if they ever need anything, they shouldn't hesitate to ask. But, anything over $100,000 will need to be prorated based on if they've gained weight. You know, Harold always said, "If you give a child a dollar, they'll ask for another one. But, if you give a child a job, they'll do shoddy work, so it's better to hire a migrant." Oh, Harold... I'm gonna spend every penny. For 40 years, I lived like a cartoon Russian mouse, but no more. No more-- I'm gonna live life to its fullest. I'm gonna eat cheese at night.
