Aren't these meetings being recorded? Uh, yes, but unfortunately we don't have anything incriminating on tape as yet. The... the suspect's working under the pretense of being some kind of end-of-life counselor. What about the nurse Ethan mentioned in his journal? Annie Chung. Works in the intensive care at Eden General. The nurse is just the liaison, sir. I mean, she connects the patients to Dr. Harris. We burn her, we burn the whole operation. Sir, look. We know this is difficult, but the best way to bring Dr. Harris down is to catch her in the act. Gentlemen, my son had another year. He could've done a clinical trial. He could've done a million things. What he could not have done was give consent, which makes this murder. I assure you, sir, if Dr. Harris helped your son die, we will prove it. Good. (WHEEZING) Charlie! Gonna need another towel. (LAUGHS) Look at that. Does it hurt? No. It feels lovely. Seriously, I-I didn't mean to. Shoot me? Yeah, funny, that. And yet here we are. (GRUNTS) There's probably a lesson about guns embedded in all of this, eh, Charlie? My mom got the gun after my dad left, said it made her feel safer at night. (YVONNE WHEEZING) She's close. How can you tell? I was a doctor, too, Charlie. Well, plastic surgeon. It was all very pleasant until I did something stupid and they took my license away. (DOORBELL RINGS) Oh, thank Christ.

Except in my case, there was no one there willing to help. Listen to me. Right now, they don't have anything on us. So we just need to be smarter. You know what? I had a few ideas while I was bleeding to death. Aging baby boomers are gonna want to die in the same manner in which they lived, bourgeois comfort. Now, the Swiss, they know that.
