 [coughs] Do it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'll do the time. 
 You drive me to the police station right now. 
 It's too late. 
 I have to go now. 
 [dramatic music] 
 I think you and Des have a little side business. [gunshot] [gasps] I want a cut. Everything's my fault even though I'm the one who told you to stay away from Grady! I told you he came after my kid! I couldn't live with myself if I made a decision based on something he said in a moment of fear. What should I do? You think Grant is the son of Lucas Grant, Judge Lucas Grant. He could have done a clinical trial. He could've done a million things. What he could not have done was give consent. She's going to say you had s*x, Ben. And no one is gonna believe her if we get rid of the tape. I was born sick, born broken. So I met with Morgan. He wants to wave the white flag. [siren blares] Am I under arrest? Let's go. He wears a wire, gathers evidence against his partner. We offer him immunity. We will get back to you. Mary Mitchell, now known as Mary Harris,  was investigated for the murder of her mother. Her mother was found dead in Chalk Lake with her hands tied together. Man, you don't know who this woman is. She's been involved in the death of God knows how many people. Am I crazy like Mom? [foreboding music] Why are you doing this? What? Saving people a trip to Switzerland. The short answer: I believe we should be in control of our life and our death. That's liberty. And dying isn't a crime. But helping people die makes you a criminal. You think so? I mean... yeah. ♪ Is there a long answer? I should've come forward sooner. I know that now. I'd like to explain. I'm a doctor. My patient was suffering. I couldn't just stand by and do nothing. [both gasp] ♪ [both moaning] Oh, God, you don't seem sick. [both panting] ♪ I'm sorry. I meant that as compliment. I'm sorry. I was acting on instinct. [bluesy rock music] ♪ Mary Kills People 01x05 
The Judas Cradle 
Original Air Date:  February 22, 2017 The last time I examined Sid, his anxiety was through the roof, convinced whoever shot him would finish the job, even with the cops there. So I thought if transferring him to a room made him feel more secure, then... Do you know which porter transferred him? Uh, the one in the gray scrubs. You know how it is. I just grabbed the first one I saw. I really just wanted to help him. The disappearance of Sid Thomas-Haye has caused a major shit-storm around here. The cops are all over me. Hmm. They still haven't found him? No, but hopefully the security footage will get the cops off my back. Security footage? Yes, Dr. Taylor saw an SUV speeding away from the hospital. Hopefully when they review those street cams, they will find that car. [tense music] ♪ Well, let me know if I can do anything more to help. Will do. ♪ [box thuds] Dr. Harris and I have an appointment today, 1:00. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm just surprised he took the deal, that's all. Well, believe it or not, there are men who can resist Mary's charms. I'm just saying that he and Mary seem pretty tight. Yeah, well, you and I are pretty tight, but I'd wear a wire on your ass to avoid a murder rap. All right, what time is this meeting? Desmond said 1:00, and you know if we're late, someone's gonna die. Yeah. [beeping] [phone ringing] Mary, Mary. This isn't a good time. No, no, I need your advice. I need your help. What? The Danvers woman has asked me to pray. Pray with her. I'm not gonna do that. I'm a man of medicine, Mary, you know, science, reality. So what's reality? Well, he's out of options. He's mechanically alive. What about more surgery? He's not strong enough for that. Tell her that. You know what I think? There should be a rule. I know, against asking doctors to pray in a hospital. Well, Dennis, you have two options. You can grow some balls and tell Sonia to pull the plug on her husband or you can get on your goddamn knees and pray. Mary, are you okay? I'm fine. I have to go. ♪ Here's a riddle. What has a gunshot wound, wears a hospital gown, and can barely walk by himself? I don't know. Maybe Prentice and Hall have seen him. [laughter] That's not even a riddle. You're right. It's a joke. [sighs] Ignore them. ♪ Check this out. There's an SUV. It's a Yukon XL. Can't see anything. How do we know if it's Sid? We run the plates, get a name, and start asking questions. God, you're so new. [tense music] ♪ Sid Thomas-Haye. What about him? Ellen hauled me in her office to ask me all sorts of questions since he was transferred to my ward by you. What did you tell her? The truth. You should try it sometime. Did you have anything to do with that guy's disappearance? Yes. Oh. Annie, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to get you involved, but I've got it all under control, I promise. You promised when we started this that everything was going to be fine. It is so not fine. You are being followed by the police, and now you're helping somebody escape police custody. I don't even know what this has become. You don't understand. I didn't have a choice. Well, I do. I quit. Annie, wait. No. We are going to get caught. And I cannot get caught. [solemn music] ♪ [pounding on door] [light jazz music] ♪ My clothes were strangling me. ♪ [door bangs] Is "Ben" short for something? Benjamin. Benedict. Benvolio. [laughs] You mind telling me why your pupils are so pinned? It's because my future's so bright. What do you want? She likes you, you know. You really think getting high is gonna make this any easier? The first person she's been with since her marriage ended. Really? How are you going to live with yourself? I'm thinking I'll inject narcotics into my veins on the regular. What's your plan, Benvolio? My plan, my plan, Desmond, is, I am just doing my job. Throw yourself into the work. That's a good, solid plan. But it's the same thing, really. The drugs, the law... it's all just an attempt to control the chaos. You ever think Mary's the one that creates the chaos? Yeah, she's good at that. But if you know her, then you know that it's worth it, right? The thing is, I don't know her. What I do know is that she's out of control, and this is the only way she'll stop. This is gonna break her heart. Say something. Hail Mary, full of grace... [laughs] ♪ The Lord is with thee ♪ 
♪ Now and at the hour of our death ♪ Sing along with me, Benvolio. [dramatic music] [chimes tinkling, water lapping] [clunk] [light rattling] [dramatic music] ♪ [clunking] ♪ [rustling] ♪ [whispers] Oh, my... [gasps] Oh, my... It can't be. Hi, Mama. Um, you're kind of hurting me. Hey. What are you doing here? I lost my math book. Can you go check under your bed, please. Kevin, what the hell? How many times have I told you you can't just come in here whenever you feel like it? Cambie needed her math book... This is not your house anymore. I should be able to come home and not worry if someone's gonna be here or not. Okay, fine. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, come here. It's okay, come here, come here. It's okay. [sniffling] It's okay. It's okay. I got it. Shh, Mary. Mary, Mary. I'm sorry. You should take your key back. Found it. Bye, Mama. Oh, good. Wait, wait. Okay, okay, Mom. Little face, I love you. [giggles lightly] Mary, hey. You really need to get some rest. All right? I'm sorry about what I said the other day. It's fine. I just lost it on Kevin, too. Why? I don't know. I guess it's all getting to me. You know what's weird too? I keep thinking about Ben, like, wanting to talk to him. Ben the cop. Yeah, Ben the cop. And it's crazy given the circumstances, but I really...  thought there was something there, but maybe it was just the great s*x. [scoffs] It wasn't that great. Saw it. What, it was like 30 seconds? It's impossible. I mean... Yeah, it's impossible. Yeah, it's impossible because you're going to jail, Mary. You can't move forward, right? You can't get anywhere without trust. Trust no one, that's what I say. What's wrong with you? Nothing, I'm fine. I'm good. You're high, God. Mary... sh1t. I told you she'd notice. She's a doctor. Don't lie to me, asshole. You're high. Lie to her, asshole. Fine, fine, I slipped up, okay? Not okay. When did this happen? Today. I'm... I'm an idiot. I'm sorry. Why? What triggered it? I'm an addict. I don't need a trigger. Everything's a... a trigger. Is it because of what I said? Jesus, Des, I didn't mean to blame you. I was just scared. I... It's not your fault. She's gonna call it off. No, she loves it too much. She's not calling it off and neither are we. Hey, it's a disease. It's a process. Slips are part of recovery. That's what they say, right? Des, I need you. You're the only person in my corner right now. If you lose it, I'll lose it. After Morgan, we'll figure this out. [rock music playing] Hi, Des. Mary, right? Hi, Morgan. Hi, come on in. [drum flourish playing, electric guitar strumming] Do you have visitors, or... Yeah, I'm sorry. They... they just showed up. Guys, time to pack it up. [rock music playing] This is the band. Meet Medieval Carnage. Hey there. Hi. They make me look good. You make us look good, man. Have you seen him shred? Guy's a genius. I'm his drummer, Pete. Hi. What's wrong with this guy? He invites his banger friends the day he's supposed to die? You guys friends of Morgan's? We're counselors. Kind of like palliative care. We can come back if you guys need to... Need to shred or whatever. No, no, no, let's roll. I'm glad you decided to get counseling. It'll be good for you. Yeah, thanks for dropping by, guys. You're gonna be fine, brother. Yeah, mate, so are you. Get him out of here. [door creaks and clicks closed] I am so sorry. Morgan, do they know? No. It's just... It's been hard on them too, you know, watching me die, and they sometimes stop in and just check and see if I'm breathing. I still think that we should go. No, no, please, please, I need your help. I'm begging you. Des, it's okay. It's okay. Look at me. It's okay. [somber music] How are you feeling? Good. Weird. Feel like I'm standing at the edge of a cliff. Does that make any sense? It makes a lot of sense. We have a few things to go over, and I have something for you to sign. Mm-hmm. Des, the contract? ♪ Des? [dramatic music] [mouths words] [sniffles] [mouthing words] These friends of yours... have you known them for a long time? 20 years. We went to high school together. Misfits and losers, you know. I guess we banded together... literally. That's great. Such an important part of life, isn't it? To have friends you can count on. Mary... Friends can be such a comfort in a time of suffering. What's she gonna do, talk this guy to death? I don't know. [foreboding music] We hope that we can be as well. And we would be happy to provide more counseling sessions  whenever you need them. That's her cover story. Where is she going with this? That sounds great, um,  but right now, I'm kind of tired. Cystic Fibrosis flare-up. It happens. [paper rustling] We can reschedule your counseling session for another time. You should rest now. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Please, wait. You know what, Des? I think it's really unprofessional of you to come to a counseling session high. [scratching] The wire, he's taking off the wire. Frank! So maybe you should just walk home and think about what you've done. I'm a b*st*rd, okay? I'm a b*st*rd. Don't go. Don't go. [engine turns over] 
 
 Please. You piece of sh1t. Frank! Frank, take it easy. Come on, man. Come on. Off, off! Get off! Back off! Off! She made me! Of course she didn't make you! You're going down for this. Fine, you can go ahead, and you read me my rights, eh? Well? Come on. Get the hell out of my sight. You can't arrest me. Get out of my goddamn sight. With pleasure. Do you realize... do you realize how bad this is? Huh? Come on, I told you he was high, all right? You pushed it. I pushed it? No, no, no, you don't get to put this one me, all right? You compromised this case from day one. That right? Remember that, huh? You know what? You can do the debriefing with Grant. Tell him whatever the hell you want. I'm done. Frank... No, I'm done. Frank, come on. I'm done. Jess. Hey, want to skip today? No. We can go to the mall. I have money today for real. That's cool. Have fun. What? Why are you bailing on me? Because you're a psychopath. Jess. Jess, I need you. I love you. No, you don't. Oh, okay. Is that what this is about? You mad I'm not a dyke? Whoa. Oh, I'm sorry. What are you, embarrassed? Well, you should be. I thought we were just having some fun. I can't believe you're ruining our friendship over this. We could have been like sisters, Jess, and now you're turning into this selfish bitch. I'm a self... No, you are the most selfish person in the world. I could search the whole planet, and I wouldn't find a more self-absorbed person than... [whack] Oh. Oh! ♪ [grunting] Ah! [grunting] [screams] So, transfer her upstairs, and if she's in a lot of pain, give her 50 milligrams of morphine. 50? We want to ease her pain, not put her in a coma. Did I say...? Five. Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm... It's been a long day. Hey, I've got something that'll cheer you up. Did you hear about Matt Danvers? ♪ He woke up about an hour ago. We've been praying and praying, even Dr. Taylor. It turns out I have a knack. ♪ I could see you waiting for me. I never lost faith. Wow, that's... That's amazing. And, Matt, you feel okay? It's all good. It's a miracle, Mary. Well, Sonia, Matt, I'm so happy for both of you. This is... [phone ringing] Great, great news. Excuse me. [phone ringing] Hello? Hello, Dr. Harris? This is principal Amelia Foster from Westbridge Academy. Is everything okay? It's about your daughter Jessica. You need to come to the school immediately. We have a situation. Oh, my God, is that... What happened? Jess attacked Naomi. Is that true? No, she hit me first. No, I didn't. Why are you fighting? What's going on? They won't say. The most I could get out of them is that they were arguing and then it got physical. Either way, we have a zero-tolerance policy for violence at Westbridge. There will be consequences. Well, I don't think that Naomi should be punished. She didn't instigate anything. Well, Jess said she did. Well, it's hearsay. Are we in court? What is this? Come on. How about I talk? Given your daughter's excellent records, I won't suspend them, but there will be detention, after school for two weeks. That seems fair. Of course. Okay, Naomi, let's go. Jess, wait, I wanna talk to you. Just leave me alone. Hey, slow down and look at me. Don't you get it? I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to look at you. I don't... I don't want anything to do with you. Why are you here? Because I want to help you, because I love you. I'm so sick of people talking about love when they have no idea what it means. You know, if you love somebody, you don't lie to them. You don't tell them you care about them when all you care about is yourself. Jess. No, just go. It's all you ever do anyways, and you know, it used to make me really sad, but I don't really care anymore, because when you're around, everything really sucks. Hey, hey, hey, Jess. What the hell is happening between you two? She hates me. Look, I know you've been under a lot of stress lately, and the financial pressure I've put you under hasn't helped. I know that. That's all gonna change. The house just sold a couple hours ago, well over asking. So, I'll be able to pay you back. You can pull back on your hours, spend more time with the girls. Where are you gonna live? I'm moving in with Louise. What? I love her, and she loves me. Sometimes it can be that simple. I think it's too fast. ♪ Well, you know what? I never thought I'd get here, but I did. Where? Get where? To a place where it doesn't really matter what you think. Another setback. I understand your frustration, sir. I mean, I've been on cases that have taken months, if not years, so. And you've been given every opportunity and every resource for this case. I don't understand what the problem is. I want answers about my son. Well, we are making progress. We have identified another potential victim. The hospital records confirm that Annie Chung was indeed his nurse.

No. They sit you on this triangular metal point, and you slowly become impaled, or they strap you to the iron chair with hundreds of tiny little spikes, or they tie you up in the town square, and you die the slowest death imaginable on display for the whole town. Nice. Why are you telling me this? Because in 100 years, they'll look back at now and say that the most popular form of torture was refusing to let people die. Dragging it out. Give people false hope, false relief, hook them up to machines. Something that should take months to kill them would take years. Those people? They're the bad guys. But you? You're one of the good ones. Do you really think so? Oh, yeah. Wow. [chuckles] Are you going to stay with me? Yes, of course I will. Can you talk to me? You know, the first time I did this, I was 16. It was with my mother. She was sick? Yeah, she was depressed. She wanted to die more than anything. So each day I'd come from school not knowing what I'd find. And my mother was good at a lot of things, but she was terrible at suicide. [laughs] [chuckles] Maybe there was something holding her back. I don't know. At first, I... I tried to talk her out of it. So many times. But after a while, I realized that was never gonna work. Forcing her to stay alive wasn't the way to save her. So I helped. She said she might pull a Houdini, but I knew she wouldn't.
