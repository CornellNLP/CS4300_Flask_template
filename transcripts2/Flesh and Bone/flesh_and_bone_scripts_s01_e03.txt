 Previously on "Flesh and Bone"...  
 I miss you. 
 Paul : We have a star ready to ascend. 
 I want to launch her in a new ballet. 
 We need a hot [Snaps fingers] of-the-moment choreographer. 
 The last thing I need is a usurper. 
 Can I get an extra gram? 
 Just need to make it through this week. 
 Claire : My brother, Bryan, just shipped back from Afghanistan. 
 You marry that gal the first chance you get. 
 [Grunts] 
 Is the mobster here? 
 Sergei, meet Claire. 
 Ballerina. 
 Claire : I want to watch. 
 Paul : Monsieur Brousseau is investing in you. 
 Please arrive in five minutes. You're going to undress? 
 Paul : It is just business, Claire. 
 Good business. 
 Bryan : Where the hell are you?

 Man : What is that? 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Water turns on] 
 Can I get some of that? 
 Here. 
 Uh, Claire Robbins. 
 Woman : Roberts? 
 Robbins. 
 I'm sorry, no. 
 Are you absolutely sure? Can you check again? 
 There's no Robbins at this company. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 [Dialing] 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 American Ballet Company. This is Monica. 
 Hi. Monica. 
 How are you doing? 
 I'm fine. Thanks. 
 How can I help you? 
 Um, I'm trying to track down a dancer named Claire Robbins. 
 I think she might be a new member of your company. She's about 5'4", um, brown hair, real pretty girl. 
 What is this regarding? 
 Wait. So she is a member of your company? 
 Claire Robbins is a Company member, yes. 
 Excellent. 
 Excellent. 
 Hey, uh, any chance you could give me her home address? 
 Uh, I'm her brother. 
 I don't see how I can verify that over the phone. 
 Her Pittsburgh address is, uh, 475 Wiggins Street, Pennsylvania, 15219. 
 Her date of birth is June 15, 1994. 
 She loves the Pirates. And, uh, she says she's allergic to brussels sprouts, but she's not. 
 Uh, I... I... 
 Look, I, uh... I just got into town after nine-hour bus ride. 
 I just got back from Afghanistan, and I'd really love to surprise my kid sister. 
 It would mean a lot, Monica. 
 Wow. You were overseas? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Yes, ma'am. United States Marine Corps. 
 Man, I'm sure glad to be home. 
 So, you think you can help me out? 
 W... well, normally I wouldn't give this information out. 
 I suppose I could just head there with a box of chocolates, but, I mean, that wouldn't be too personal... or original. 
 It's been a long time. 
 She lives at 260 Orchard Street. 
 But you didn't hear it from me. 
 Thank you so much. Awesome. 
 You have just made my day, Monica. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Glad I could help. 
 Thank you for your service. 
 You're more than welcome. 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 [Classical music playing] 
 Ivana : Feel the music. 
 Lengthen, Ashley. 
 Use the time. 
 Breathe, Daphne. 
 Breathe. 
 Shoulder down, Trey. 
 How many times I got to tell you? 
 Yes. Like that. 
 Next time I'll put something in it. 
 Straight. Strong. 
 Yes. 
 Wonder if frog dick tastes like chicken, too. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Ivana claps] 
 Grand allegro, three at a time. 
 You know the drill. Pasha. 
 [Up-tempo music plays] 
 Good, Suzanne. 
 Up! Up! 
 Energy. 
 Yes. 
 Extend, Ashley. Grand  jeté. 
 Patrice, shoulders down. 
 Ah, very nice, Kiira. 
 You all see how Kiira extends? 
 We all need to extend just like that. 
 Extension, extension, extension. I sound like broken record. 
 And up! Yes. 
 Yeah. Good, Ross. 
 Trey! You call that a grand  jeté? 
 I've seen third-grade girls skip rope with more intensity. 
 What do you suggest? 
 [Scoffs] What do I suggest? 
 [Music stops] 
 Stop jumping like a little bitch is what I suggest. 
 All the height in the world won't mask a faggot in a pair of tights. 
 What do I suggest? 
 Continue, please. 
 [Music resumes] 
 Up! 
 Good. 
 [Snaps] 
 [Music stops] 
 Some artists are born, some are made, and some emerge from an upside-down, deliciously kinky, terrifyingly mysterious forest of beauty and wonder. 
 These artists never stop seeking and dreaming. 
 They bewitch and confound us, make us question ourselves, and lead us to our ultimate goal, which is... ? 
 All : Transcendence. 
 We are so honored to have the inimitable Toni Cannava with us this season. 
 Give it up, angels. Let's make her proud. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 [Up-tempo music plays] 
 Paul : Trey is technically sound in almost every respect, but he jumps like a Chelsea queen when they announce the Barneys co-op sale. 
 Mia has good presence, but her feet can be a bit slow. 
 Now, Daphne is an up-and-comer. 
 I think you'll respond to her. 
 And that creature there, with the alabaster skin and the Abyssinian eyes, is none other than Claire Robbins... 
 The reason why you're here. 
 [Music stops] 
 That was nice, but we can do better. 
 We can always do better. 
 They're all yours. 
 Okay. 
 First things first... 
 Take your shoes off. 
 Come on. 
 Let's go. Take them off. Bare feet, please. 
 [Dancers murmuring] 
 Okay, everybody, please stand. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 How are you? 
 Good. 
 Fine. 
 Well, I'm really excited to be here. 
 I have been a fan of that man's work for a very long time, and it is an honor to get to be invited to work with such a distinguished company. 
 Thank you, Mr. Grayson. 
 All right. 
 You ready to get to work? 
 Yeah. Let's go. 
 I'd like you to start by simply walking around the space. 
 I know... Crazytown. Trust me. 
 Walk. 
 If you feel like going in the opposite direction, then go in the opposite direction. 
 Really feel the floor. 
 Pronate all the way through the arch, through the balls of the feet, through your toes. 
 Slowly. 
 Even slower than that. 
 Let's stop looking in the mirror and start looking at each other. 
 Really look. 
 Okay. 
 Stop where you are, close your eyes... 
 And breathe for a moment. 
 Feel the floor under your feet. 
 Get in touch... 
 ... with all that is you. 
 Feel your breath and your pulse... 
 Moving through your body. 
 Okay. 
 Open your eyes. 
 Great. 
 Let's do some hugging. 
 [Light laughter] 
 Grab a partner. I don't care who. 
 Go ahead and laugh. It's okay to laugh. 
 Okay. Let's go. Hug your partner, please. 
 [Laughter continues] 
 Do you feel... excited? 
 Confused? 
 Vulnerable? 
 Do you like the way your partner smells? 
 When was the last time you actually embraced one of your fellow dancers? 
 When was the last time you felt yearning? 
 Lust? 
 Jealousy? 
 What are you willing to let go of? 
 What aren't you willing to let go of? 
 [Door opens] 
 [Whispers indistinctly] 
 [Children laughing, shouting indistinctly] 
 Man : Hey, take it easy, buddy. Be careful. 
 Kerwyn Voss is sort of a pretentious douche. 
 Okay, not sort of, but don't be intimidated. 
 He likely got pummeled in dodgeball one too many times. 
 He'll basically ask you where you're from, how long you've been dancing, who's your favorite choreographer, how many times you got detention in high school, all the easy stuff. 
 You seem nervous. Are you nervous? 
 Maybe a little. 
 Yeah, totally. 
 Oh, just be yourself. You'll be fine. 
 I have a sneaking suspicion that you're gonna have a great day. 
 [Recorder beeps] 
 How old are you? 
 21. 
 So, Jessica tells me that you hail from Pittsburgh. 
 What part? 
 Polish Hill. Do you know it? 
 No, I... I don't. 
 What's it like there? 
 Polish Hill is... Polish Hill. 
 Nothing fancy. 
 We got a really pretty church Immaculate Heart of Mary. 
 So, I assume Polish Hill is pretty Polish. 
 Polish and hilly. 
 Big family? 
 Just me, my dad, and my brother. 
 Oh, so you were raised by your father? 
 Pretty much. 
 And what does he do? 
 He was a metal pourer at the steel mill before it closed. 
 Oh, and he loves the arts? 
 He loves the steelers. 
 So, uh, what about your mother? Did she pass away? 
 No. 
 Did she dance? 
 I don't know. 
 When I was speaking with Jessica earlier, she mentioned that you had apprenticed at the Pittsburgh Ballet for a year at age 18. So... where have you been until now? 
 There was a hiatus. 
 You care to elaborate? 
 It just wasn't possible to dance at that time. 
 Because... ? 
 Because of extenuating circumstances. 
 [Sighs] 
 There is no there there. 
 Excuse me? 
 Gertrude Stein. 
 The writer Gertrude Stein. She said that. 
 "There is no there there." 
 It's just that people are gonna be curious. 
 I'm certainly curious. 
 After all, how does an apprentice... 
 Someone not even in the corps... 
 Take off three years, show up at an open call, then get hired on to one of the most competitive ballet companies in New York? 
 And now a piece of new work is being created especially for you. Without the rigor of working in a company day in and day out, how does one ascend so quickly? 
 [Echoing] What is your secret, Claire Robbins? 
 What is your secret, Claire Robbins, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania? 
 [Normal voice] Did you make some mephistophelian deal with the Devil? 
 [Door opens] 
 Oh. 
 Can someone say, "enter the queen"? 
 Sound the trumpets! 
 [Chuckles] Hello, Kerwyn. 
 Oh. 
 Mm. 
 Oh, Kiira, you look stunning, as always. 
 I hope I'm not intruding. I just had to say hello. 
 Oh, no, no. Not at all. Claire and I were just talking about the proverbial dance of things. 
 Oh, Kerwyn, do you want to know a secret? 
 Ooh. 
 Oh, this season is gonna be simply incredible. 
 I understand Toni Cannava is conceiving an original piece. 
 That sounds extremely promising. 
 Oh, yes. And the most exciting part? 
 Oh, do tell, Kiira. Do tell. 
 There's a special casting surprise. 
 I will star in the "A" cast. 
 Oh, that's fabulous! 
 It had to be this way, of course. 
 We simply couldn't disappoint the fans. 
 Oh, how thrilling! You and Cannava! 
 I can't wait. 
 Uh, Claire will perform lead on the second night, in the "B" cast, which is sure to cause sensation. 
 Oh. This heretofore unknown Claire Robbins from Pittsburgh's Polish Hill. 
 Brilliant strategy, don't you think? 
 Oh, everyone will be desperate to come. 
 Both nights. I know I will. 
 The American dream. 
 So compelling, is it not? 
 A new discovery such as Claire is always exciting. 
 Yes, it certainly is. 
 Now, you'll be doing "Rubies," too, correct? 
 If you're done with me, I really should be going. 
 Yes, I think I have everything I need. 
 Well, I should, uh, scurry off and do my writerly thing. 
 [Grunts] 
 It was nice to meet you, Claire. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 I look forward to seeing what all the fuss is about. 
 Oh, it's so lovely to see you. Mwah! 
 Mwah! 
 Mm. 
 Being prima is not only being able to dance it. 
 You must also know how to behave like one. 
 Eventually, perhaps, you will learn this. 
 I suppose I will. 
 Your nose is bleeding. 
 [Sniffs] 
 [Children shouting indistinctly] 
 Excuse me. You got a child here? 
 No. 
 Then what you doing here, then? 
 I'm eating my pretzel. 
 What pretzel? I don't see a pretzel. Do you see a pretzel? 
 I don't see sh1t. 
 I just finished it. 
 So it's probably time you got the f*ck up out of here then. 
 You need me to say it again? 
 No. 
 I heard you loud and clear. 
 Apúrate. 
 It's a free country. 
 Pervert. 
 Excuse me. Sorry. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Who the f*ck's he think he's kidding, huh? 
 [Second  pas de deux  from "Rubies" plays] 
 Slow down. Keep up. 
 Where's the fire? You're rushing. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Jesus. 
 Oh, God. 
 [Music stops] 
 [Sniffing] 
 Kiirishka, darling. 
 Perhaps we are a little too enthusiastic with the tempo today, huh? 
 Perhaps we take a short break, no? 
 Yeah. 
 Five minutes, please. 
 Pasha. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Okay, princess. 
 Come, come. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Sighs] What's going on with you? 
 I'm fine. 
 You don't seem fine. 
 [Sniffs] Really? How do I seem? 
 You're way ahead of the music. 
 I feel like I'm chasing you. 
 So keep up. 
 You're using again. 
 Your f*cking nose is running all over me. 
 Tell me I'm wrong, Keer. 
 What's in the bag? 
 When are you going to let this go? 
 Let what go? 
 Us. It's pathetic. 
 Really? 
 Stay on your own side of the street. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Laughter] 
 [Door closes] 
 I started this ballet company in the back of an Italian bistro in the Village. 
 Il Piccolo Lupo, on the corner of Perry and West 4th Street. 
 I was a waiter. 
 I worked such long hours. 
 There were nights that my feet ached more than they did when I was dancing eight shows a week in front of thousands of people chanting my name. 
 And there were... 
 [birds chirping] 
 It's a nest. 
 With baby birds. 
 [Chirping] 
 There was this, um... 
 [Clears throat] Pay phone, uh, in the back, near the bathrooms. 
 I started the American Ballet Company at that very pay phone. 
 It was a far cry from my dressing room filled with flowers. 
 Every nickle, dime, and quarter I made went into that piece-of-shit metal box. 
 For three... years, I did not... take smoke breaks, I did not take walks, I barely took a piss. 
 You cannot conceive of the river of blood, sweat, and tears it took to build this company... 
 Begging for funds, the pleading for free rehearsal space, the sleepless nights... 
 The blind faith. 
 I lost years... 
 Of my life birthing this company that you are now part of... 
 [chirping stops] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 Whatever it is you did or didn't do with our esteemed chairman last night, well, let's just say he was resoundingly offended. 
 I can explain. 
 No. No, no, no. 
 There's no need for that. 
 You see, it... it no longer matters because he's decided to cease his support of the American Ballet Company, my company... 
 That I fought so hard to build all those years ago in that shithole Italian bistro in the Village. 
 I'd like you to have a good long think about that, Claire. 
 Can you do that for me? 
 And while you do that, I'd like you... 
 To get out of my sight! 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Conversations stop] 
 [Crying] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Knock on door] 
 Come in. 
 [Sighs] 
 Thanks for coming in, Daphne. I know things are heating up. 
 It's a busy time for all of us. 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Sighs] Daphne, my love... 
 I know I'm about to broach a sensitive subject, one that ABC has avoided since I brought you into the fold. 
 Is something wrong? 
 [Sighs] 
 Let's see. How best to put this... 
 Oh, Daphne, the truth of the matter is that, in terms of institutional solvency, things have recently become, well... dire is a good word, I suppose. 
 The American Ballet Company is in a state of financial emergency. 
 And if we don't find a quick solution, we may be forced to terminate a number of contracts. 
 You want me to go to my father. 
 You can't imagine how difficult it was for us to call you in here like this. 
 How much are we talking? 
 $250,000. 
 Quite a sum, I know. 
 But no doubt an inconsequential drop in the bucket with regard to your father. 
 With all due respect, Jessica, regarding my father, you have no f*cking idea what is and isn't of consequence. 
 If I get this money for you, I want a guaranteed promotion. 
 Soloist. 
 Sold. 
 Don't think I haven't noticed how hard you've been working. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 This would never have happened if Jeffrey was still here. 
 [Horns honking] 
 Daphne's pal Claire, right? 
 Hi. 
 Hey. What can I do for you, Daphne's pal Claire? 
 Is Sergei around? 
 What do you want with the boss man? 
 I'd just like to talk to him. 
 You sure you want to do that? 
 Okay, then. Come on. 
 [Dance music plays in distance] 
 [Dog barking] 
 Jimjo? 
 Excuse me? 
 Who you looking for? 
 My sister. 
 Who's your sister? 
 Uh, Claire Robbins. 
 You're Claire's brother? Oh, wow. 
 Wow, the brother of Claire. 
 Claire's masculine sibling. 
 Okay, okay, okay. Th... this is an excellent day. 
 She's a really nice girl. She's really nice. 
 She's... she's special. 
 I happen to know for a fact that she's not home, but her roommate is. 
 And who are you, exactly? 
 The middleman. 
 The middleman? 
 Yes, indeed. 
 You need any help with anything, you let me know. 
 It's my job. It's my job to help. 
 I'm Romeo. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you, Jimjo. [Chuckles] 
 It's Bryan. 
 Oh. Bryan. 
 Of course, of course. 
 Oh, you served, huh? 
 Oh, wow. I'm impressed. 
 That's awesome. Wow. 
 Did you serve? 
 No. No, not me. No. 
 Don't get me wrong. 
 I... I mean, I serve, but but not like that. 
 I... I... I serve in other ways. 
 I mean, we're all serving something, aren't we? 
 Uh, oh. Let me get that for you. 
 [Intercom rings] 
 It's truly an honor to meet you. 
 Mia : Hello? 
 Uh, you have a visitor. 
 Who is it? 
 Claire's brother, Bryan. 
 [Door buzzes] 
 Oh, do you need any help with your bag or anything? 
 I got it. 
 I'm... I'm glad you're here. 
 Thanks. 
 You're 100% welcome. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Just turn the knob. 
 [Door opens] 
 Soldier brother. 
 Come on in. 
 You can set your stuff over there. That's hers. 
 I haven't seen your sis since rehearsal today. 
 This sort of punk-rock, lesbian witch, who's probably not really even a lesbian, was making us f*cking hug each other like we were in some Christian f*cking youth group. 
 I thought at some point we were gonna sit in a big circle and bust out the dream journals. 
 I mean, if I really wanted to get in touch with my unconscious, I would make an appointment with the shrink or go do plant medicine in the rainforest. 
 Maybe I'd even sink to the depths of taking an acting class. 
 Next thing you know, we'll be doing trust exercises and recounting various childhood traumas. 
 Care for a beer, Bryan? 
 Sure. 
 f*ck you! 
 f*ck you! 
 f*ck you! 
 f*ck you! 
 f*ck you! 
 f*ck you! 
 f*ck you! 
 f*ck you! 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Door closes] 
 Jessica : What else did you do in afterschool? 
 Molly : I drew a cat and a magic banjo. 
 Yeah? Is that cat playing the magic banjo? 
 [Chuckling] No! She's eating pasghetti. 
 Why didn't you bring it home? 
 I don't know. 
 Of course you do. You know Mommy loves your drawings. 
 Why didn't you bring it with you? 
 I don't know! 
 Okay, okay. 
 Then tell me how it was in school today. 
 They told me to give you this.

 Lovely Claire returns to Anastasia. 
 Hello, Sergei. 
 She is good, no? 
 She is one of our best. 
 How are things going for you at the ballet? 
 Pretty well so far... I think. 
 You'll do fine, I'm sure. 
 Better than fine. 
 I hope you're right. 
 I truly love the art form. I love it so much. 
 When I was a boy, perhaps 12 years old, I see the great Tatiana Terekhova dance Grigorovich's "The Sleeping Beauty" at the Kirov. 
 It was my first ballet. I did not want to go. 
 My mother insisted. 
 Terekhova had previously been a classical soloist. 
 This was her first leading role. 
 When Terekhova was awakened by the prince's kiss, it was as if my own life briefly turned into dream. 
 The manner in which the princess awakened, the way she danced out of her prison of sleep and into the audience's hearts... 
 She fell asleep this girl and awoke this beautiful woman, asleep for 100 years, the hall of mirrors, perfection of love. 
 The entire theater was dreaming. 
 The musicians in the orchestra pit, the people in the finest boxes, the mezzanine, even those of us in the furthest stalls, we were all dreaming the dance of the waking princess. 
 [Chamber music playing] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 What do you think? 
 Despite its obvious savagery, there's something almost gentle at play. 
 Look in Judith's eyes, the emotion in them. 
 Do you like it? 
 For which house? 
 Southampton. 
 So, how have you been? 
 Very well. 
 Thank you, no. 
 No. 
 Chalmer : Maxwell. 
 Chalmer. 
 This is my daughter, Daphne. 
 Ah, it is nice to finally meet you. 
 Is Harvard keeping you busy? 
 I'm not at Harvard. 
 Oh, I... I assumed you were wowing them in Cambridge, just as your father did back in the day. 
 Where are you in school? 
 Daphne's currently not in school. 
 What do you do? 
 I dance for the American Ballet Company. 
 I'm about to be promoted to soloist. 
 Daphne  will  be in Cambridge once she gets this little ballet bug out of her system. 
 Well, good luck with the dancing. 
 And congratulations on the promotion, Daphne. 
 It was lovely to meet you. 
 You too. 
 Good to see you, Maxwell. 
 Chalmer. 
 It's such a rare treat to see you. 
 There must be something you need. 
 I just wanted to say hello. 
 I got to run.

 [Up-tempo rock music plays] 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 Good night. 
 See ya. 
 Night. 
 Sergei, I have a proposition for you. 
 [Thunder crashes] 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Door closes] 
 f*ck. 
 f*ck. 
 Claire! 
 Claire! 
 Claire! 
 Claire! 
 Claire! Come here. It's okay. 
 Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 [Crying] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Claire, it's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 Just put them on the floor. 
 Night. 
 Night.
