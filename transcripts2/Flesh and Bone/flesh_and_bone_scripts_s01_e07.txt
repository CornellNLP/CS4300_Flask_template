 Previously on "Flesh and bone"... 
 Trey's recent promotion has nothing to do with our romantic relationship. 
 Get me a beer! 
 Your brother, the marine. 
 You should've had the decency to die over there. 
 The funds I transferred to american ballet company -- 
 And yet I have received no "Thank you" card. 
 Your donation has to remain anonymous. 
 I will star in the "A" cast. 
 Being prima is not only being able to dance it. 
 Tell me about your injury. 
 I'm fine. I'm perfect. 
 My little pony? 
 I didn't come all the way into the city to watch you mope. 
 Blood is in the water. 
 What? 
 Blood is in the water. 
 Blood is in the water. Blood is in the water. 
 Let me set you straight on something, muñequita. 
 Last night's bullshit ain't gonna fly. 
 I catch you hiding food up in these sheets again, it's coming back in a feeding tube. 
 Tu entiendes? 
 Oh, there she is. 
 That's right, bring that bitch out. 
 Don't make me wait all day, 'cause you know what, honey? 
 You need her. 
 There's only one way out of here. 
 Mia? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm h-her friend. 
 So what are doing standing in the hall? 
 See if you can talk some sense. 
 I got tubing orders, she don't find a way to choke it down. 
 Monica said we could visit starting today. 
 I didn't know if you wanted me to. 
 I don't have to stay. 
 Okay. Sorry. 
 I just came to see if you were... 
 If I could do anything. 
 The police said that Romeo found you, that... that he saved your life. 
 He's disappeared since then. 
 I don't see him around. 
 I hear him up on the roof sometimes, but I don't know. 
 We're in tech now. 
 It's pretty crazy. 
 We open in three days, and I -- 
 sh1t. 
 Oh, no. 
 Oh, Mia, that was so dumb. I shouldn't have said that. 
 Hey, you'll be back. 
 It's just a temporary... 
 It's... 
 Just focus on getting out of here, okay? 
 Do what they tell you. 
 I can't. 
 It's the one you like, right? 
 Let's get you out of here. 
 Now you. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 It's your turn. 
 Robbins! 
 Robbins! 
 Mrs. Bialy, hi. 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 I've been -- -Two weeks my daughter's laid up in this hell hole. 
 Isn't a single actual American works here. 
 Where are the rest of them? 
 They, um -- it's tech. 
 At least you came. 
 God bless you. 
 22 years old, my baby, whole life in front of her. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 She's always been tough. 
 I raised her right. But this? 
 This f*cking disease? 
 Wham, out of nowhere, like a goddamn brick to my forehead. 
 I think Mia's had issues with food for a long time. 
 Issues? 
 With food? 
 You sound like the goddamn Pakistani doctor. 
 She's a ballerina, Robbins. 
 There's your issue with the food. 
 I'm talking about the disease, the M.S. 
 Jesus. 
 M.S.? 
 You don't go to do that. 
 I know she told you. 
 You don't say a word, got me? 
 Not a word. 
 This gets out to anybody, I know where it came from. 
 We clear? 
 Yes. 
 This is not over. I promise you. 
 I mean, she could have years, right? 
 They don't know. 
 It could be years before a person gets that she's crippled. 
 Absolutely. 
 Month, maybe two, She's gonna be back like nothing happened. 
 You got to help me. 
 She's pushing me away. 
 Looks at me like... 
 I mean, what did I do? 
 I never did nothing but love her. 
 What did I do? I mean, I don't know what I did. 
 Oh, my god, Bronson. 
 These are divine. 
 These are $22.50 per pound. 
 God in heaven! 
 These are impossible to get. 
 They simply can't be had. 
 But you'll get them for the gala. 
 Only because I love you. 
 Jessica, sorry to interrupt. 
 Can I talk to you for a sec? 
 Excuse me a moment, would you? 
 The check to Hudson Liquor bounced. 
 What? T-that's -- that's not possible. 
 They're holding the truck, so they're gonna put every bottle back on the shelf if we don't clear it up by tonight. 
 Can't have a gala with no booze. 
 That's -- that's got to be a glitch. 
 There's money in that account. 
 Tell him to process the payment again. 
 I did. He said he tried that, and I'm not gonna tell you what else he said. 
 Colorful. 
 Tell Bronson Paul had a crisis and I had to go handle it. 
 Sign off on whatever he needs, and then get him out of here, okay? 
 But -- 
 I-I don't think you're understanding me. 
 I was told it would take 10 business days to clear due to the sizable -- 
 It's been 12 days. 
 What? 
 No, that can't be right. 
 Can you check it again, please? 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 This is Peter Hughes. Leave a message. 
 Peter, your check bounced. 
 The check we waited an eternity for bounced. 
 f*cking -- Peter, we were counting on this. 
 It's spent. 
 H-h-how -- how could you let this happen? 
 Please explain it to me because I don't understand how you are sailing around the Caribbean or playing blackjack with British whores while your daughter is here waiting for y-- 
 You know what? You know what? I'm done. 
 Okay? I am done trying to convince Molly that she has a decent father. 
 The next time the judge wants to threaten your ass with contempt, I will stand up and I will f*cking cheer. 
 So enjoy Christmas in jail, asshole! 
 This is Peter Hughes. Leave a message. 
 Hi, Peter. I didn't mean that jail thing. 
 I... 
 We just really need the money...now. 
 And I know you are going to fix it. 
 You're a good father. 
 Hello, this is Jessica Jordan from the American Ballet Company. 
 I need to speak with Maxwell Kensington, please. 
 It's urgent. 
 Yes, his daughter, Daphne, dances with us. 
 Thank you. 
 Hello, Mr. Kensington. 
 Jessica Jordan from ABC. 
 Oh, no, no. Daphne's fine. 
 I do the same thing when my daughter's school calls. 
 A p-parent's mind just goes there. 
 Actually, I'm -- I'm calling to thank you for your generous gift and to find out if you might be ready to move up to our next donor level. 
 I-I'm referring to the donation you made earlier this year. 
 $250,000, I believe it was? 
 We gave Daphne a promotion, and... 
 I'm sorry? 
 I see. 
 Well, thank you, Mr. Kensington. 
 I apologize for the mix-up. 
 Too low. 
 Sorry. 
 For the love of god, just stop. 
 Trey, it's not your fault. 
 It's me. It's my fault. 
 I suppose I got caught up in the whole diversity dream, because I wanted this for you, Trey -- for this city, this nation. 
 I was moved by the thought of some little brown boy sitting out here in the dark, watching you, Trey, up there. 
 Balanchine, Stravinsky, the magic of it -- 
 Oh, how I wanted that for him to show him possibility. 
 "Look! 
 Behold this splendid onyx god." 
 But instead I'm handing the kid a cat turd in a bowl of milk. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 Tell me what you want. 
 What I want... is for someone to please find Ross. 
 That'll be all, Trey. 
 Thank you. 
 Mind if I bum one? 
 Oh, dear god in heaven. 
 Is this a relapse thing? 
 Maybe. 
 I know the donor isn't your dad. 
 So what? 
 So you lied. 
 You got your money. 
 You could have gotten us into trouble with the I.R.S., and it would have been a big problem. 
 I need the donor's name to clear this up. 
 We've had anonymous donors in the past. 
 Anonymous to the public, not to us. 
 I need a name. 
 Your friend's money is gone, okay? 
 We spent it on costumes and Toni and commissioning the music and three-fucking-hundred bottles of Veuve Clicquot. 
 If I can't secure more capital, we're not gonna make it past opening night. 
 Look, just -- just give me the name. 
 I'll tell him I identified him through tax records. 
 No. 
 This is your company, too, Daphne. 
 We're all responsible for what happens to it. 
 You know what I'm responsible for? 
 I'm responsible for dancing to the best of my ability, for keeping my weight a few pounds over malnourished, for showing up to rehearsals on time. 
 I could lose my job here. 
 Daphne, look. 
 I-I-I know it might be hard for you to understand with how you grew up. 
 You have a golden net underneath you. 
 I have concrete. 
 I have a kid and creditors calling at all hours of the night. 
 Just give me a name. 
 Please. 
 I can't lose this job. 
 Neither can I. 
 Don't get up. 
 Don't freak out. 
 It's nothing. 
 We talked about this. Two ballets. 
 I tell you not to freak out, and you freak out. 
 It's just that... 
 Toni's piece... is so physical. 
 The impact, the stress -- 
 Odette/Odile, Kitri, I'm quite familiar with your resume. 
 Raymonda, Sleeping Beauty... 
 But, darling, I would be lying if I said there wasn't some concern. 
 What is this concern? 
 Who is concerning? 
 Toni mentioned that she might be willing to go with Claire tomorrow t-to save your ankle after "Rubies." 
 The public comes to see me. 
 And they will in "Rubies." 
 Nonsense. 
 This Toni, she doesn't understand us. 
 A little pain is a fact of this life. 
 To feel it is a choice. 
 I choose no. 
 Toni's merely concerned. 
 You're artistic director, yes? The boss? 
 So you tell her go give her concern to somebody else. 
 I will dance. 
 Darling, je t'adore. 
 You know that. 
 But our bodies betray us all eventually. 
 My body has betrayed no one. 
 Not yet. 
 But I wonder if, for the sake of the company, you might consider... 
 Pardon me? 
 It's you! 
 You think I can't do it. 
 Oh, don't be absurd. 
 You don't want me to do it. 
 You want Claire. 
 Tell me. 
 Look in my eyes and say it. 
 Say it to my face! 
 Calm down. 
 10 years I give you, my life, this body. 
 Buttercup -- 
 Who were you before me? 
 Nothing, a joke, has-been. 
 A f*cking bus boy with a bad back and a rich boyfriend! 
 I give you perfection. 
 You need transcendence. 
 I give you every performance the best transcendence! 
 You made this company, but I am the one who made you! 
 Get out! f*ck! 
 Jesus christ! 
 Get the f*ck out! 
 Stop! 
 Get the f*ck out of here! 
 Stop. 
 Imagine you haven't all f*cked each other blind in the bathrooms, please. 
 You're delicate, sparkling gems. 
 Gleam! 
 Dazzle! 
 All right, thank you. Enough. 
 Technology people, let's move on to "Dakini." 
 I dare you to do it in under 10. 
 Come on! 
 Tommy, you want to check the special? 
 You're late. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I thought, since "Rubies" was first -- 
 You picked the wrong day to try my patience. 
 Sorry. I was at the hospital. 
 I went to see Mia. 
 Why would you do that? 
 She's my friend. 
 Oh. "Friends." 
 Yes. 
 Let me explain something to you. 
 There is nothing -- no one -- that supercedes your commitment to me. 
 This is your life. This. 
 I am your roommate. I am your friend. 
 I am your brother, your sister, your father, your lover. 
 I am your f*cking priest! 
 I am everything to you except your mother, because she will still love you if you fail. 
 I never knew my mother. 
 You arrived on my doorstep from your... grimy, inconsequential hiccup of a life. 
 And after spit-shining you, I gave you an opportunity. 
 I could have given it to 100 other girls. 
 But I gave it to you. 
 Do you know how fortunate you are? 
 Do you? 
 Because I'm pretty sure you need me. 
 Come with me. 
 This might be a good time to tell you about a certain phone call I made to the artistic director of your former company back in Pittsburgh. 
 See, I can only speculate on what had happened to make you leave so abruptly -- 
 And there is certainly a lot of speculation on their end. 
 But, then, again, I'm sure you know all too well how word gets around in a small town. 
 And I can only speculate on what would happen if I were to send you back there at the end of the season -- back to that sh1t pile of futility you call home. 
 So, yes, I need you. 
 And you need me... for now. 
 So let's just see how you do, shall we? 
 After you. 
 
 
 
 Just keep holding there, Claire. 
 Sorry this is taking so long. 
 It's still not catching the light the way it needs to. 
 Guys, can you add some cyan and, uh, take it up by half, please? 
 I've died and gone to Stevie Nicks' house. 
 Okay, that looks good. Thanks. 
 Let's jump ahead to the next cue. 
 Raise the drape. 
 Yes, let's jump. Why not? 
 It's only been two hours. 
 Oh, f*ck me! 
 Stop! Turn it off! 
 Get Claire out of there. 
 Clear the stage! 
 Careful. 
 Over the cable. 
 Watch your step. 
 Dancers, please step out of the way! 
 Track is busted. 
 Oh, is it? Is it really? 
 We open to a sold-out house in two days. 
 Repair this monstrosity immediately so I can finish my tech. 
 I can't fix it. It's fried out. 
 Needs a motor assembly. I got to order a new one. 
 What is that, a kilt? 
 Un-bifurcated garments allow increased freedom and mobility. 
 When can I look forward to this gadget arriving? 
 Let's see. It's pretty late. - 2:45. 
 If I order it right now and Pinky has it in stock, you're looking at tomorrow after lunch. 
 Can't even clear the stage until then. 
 Then, of course, you'll need an inspection. 
 Tell me this isn't happening. 
 Someone f*cking tell me this isn't f*cking happening! 
 Want me to call Pinky? 
 Yes. 
 By all means, call Pinky, order the goddamn assemblage, and have an inspector standing by. 
 You heard the man, angels! 
 Run, flee! Get the f*ck out! 
 The afternoon is yours! 
 Yeah, baby! 
 16 hours of freedom? 
 I say we head downtown and make the most of it. 
 Sergei's wondering where you've been. 
 No, thanks. 
 Hey, if ever a girl needed some party, it's you. 
 I'm fine. 
 Really? 
 Have you seen you? 
 I told you I'm fine. 
 Oh, that's a relief. 
 I thought there was some reason you were being a total bitch. 
 I'm not going back there. Not after those girls. 
 What girls? 
 You know exactly. 
 Sergei's mobster yacht with the teenage s*x slaves? 
 Keep your f*cking voice down. 
 s*x slaves. 
 I think that's none of my business. 
 You need to get away from Sergei. 
 He's not who you want him to be. 
 I got it handled. 
 Of course you do. 
 That's 'cause he's decided you're worth something. 
 I am. 
 Unlike that girl who's floating facedown in the harbor somewhere? 
 I guess she wasn't. 
 I guess she didn't matter at all. 
 I don't know what the f*ck you're talking about, but thanks for the sanctimony. 
 Five bucks says you put those roses he gave you in water when you got home. 
 He's going to force me out of the piece. 
 I'm fighting for my life here. 
 So please make me perfect. 
 Just get me through. 
 My best medical guess is that your stress fracture is splitting. 
 You need an X-ray. 
 I need the shot. 
 Just to get me through tomorrow. 
 X-ray after, I promise. 
 Bupivacaine numbs everything. 
 You could shatter your peroneus and never feel a thing. 
 Good. 
 No, not good. Bad. 
 I'm not afraid. 
 That's what scares me. 
 This is my career. 
 Do you understand? 
 Right now, I'm asking. 
 Jasper, please. 
 For me. 
 Beauty dies. 
 It can't last. 
 "Oh, momentary grace of mortal men." 
 What is point? Are you giving me shot or not? 
 I can't. 
 I won't. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Why are you sorry, because you're ruining my life? 
 Kiira. 
 I want you to heal. 
 There will be other ballets. 
 You know better than that. 
 You want me to beg? 
 I'll beg. 
 Please. 
 Do it for me. 
 This is what you want, to capture prima? 
 Yes? 
 Jasper! 
 What's the matter with you? 
 Cover yourself. 
 It was a mistake. 
 Look at me, please. 
 10CC 10 CCs. 
 Inside the circles. 
 Get the needle down near the bone. 
 Y-you want me to do it? 
 I'm handing you the gun. 
 Don't ask me to pull the trigger. 
 Yes, hello. 
 Could you tell me what sort of business I've reached, please? 
 And, uh, what's the address? 
 Thanks. 
 Name? 
 Actually, I'm not a customer. 
 You want pick-up, drop-off? 
 No, I just wanted to ask if you know, or if you work for anyone, who...who supports the ballet. 
 This is dry cleaner. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, it is. 
 I...I’m sorry. 
 I'm -- I'm in the wrong place. 
 Is there something I can do for you? 
 You were ballet dancer. 
 A long time ago, yes. 
 Not so long. 
 I work at the ballet now -- company manager. 
 I have passion for ballet. 
 Your visit here, this is most curious. 
 Yes. 
 I wanted to thank you for your generous contribution to ABC this season. 
 Please, sit. We will discuss. 
 It is unusual, no? 
 Seeking out anonymous donor. 
 Yes, and I apologize for showing up like this. 
 But we are looking for someone willing to make a critical and 11th-hour contribution. 
 Uh, $35,000. 
 $35,000. 
 To give the company's groundbreaking new performance. 
 Its... touche finale. 
 Such a small sum -- $35,000. 
 But crucial. 
 Obviously, it will remain anonymous. 
 No one has to know. 
 Is that how much you took? 
 I resent the -- I -- 
 I-I didn't... 
 I was going to give it back. 
 I'm not a criminal. 
 I'm a mother. 
 You needed money for child. 
 Sorry. 
 God, I'm so sorry. I should never have come. 
 Thank you. 
 Bad, bad judgment. 
 So stupid. 
 Stupid. 
 I am no longer interested in remaining anonymous. 
 I deserve honor as major donor. 
 Oh, my god. Yes. 
 Yes. Yes, of course. 
 House seats on opening night, invitation to gala for myself and friends. 
 Of course. 
 Uh, house seats are not a problem. 
 Two or three... 
 11. 
 Perfect. 11. 
 Clementine. 
 Did you read the book? 
 Did you read it? 
 I've been, uh, afraid to ask, But everything's faster now, so I have to ask. 
 I can't wait any longer to ask. 
 Did you re-read the book? Did you read it? 
 No, I didn't. Can I get by, please? 
 You got to read the book. You got to read it. 
 You got to read it. 
 You did a good thing for Mia, a really good thing. 
 There are bigger deeds to be done. 
 It's coming soon. Do you feel it? 
 Romeo, please get out of the way. 
 I need to get upstairs. 
 Shh, shh. You hear that? Hear that? 
 Hear that? Hear that? You hear that? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 I need to go inside. 
 No, no, no. They're talking. They're talking now. 
 They're talking. They're congregating. 
 They're talking and congregating. 
 You got to listen to the folk when they gather and converse. 
 It matters now, explicitly. Supremely. 
 It matters more than ever, more than anything ever, ever. 
 It's a reckoning, Clementine. 
 It's coming soon. But don't despair. 
 The book says that the folk will prevail because of you. 
 You will break the chains, and-- and you will free yourself and conquer the grey and rise, rise, rise above oceans of blood and portent skies. 
 We wait only for you. 
 We wait for you. 
 We wait for you. For you. 
 It's all in the book, Clementine. 
 Read the book I gave you. 
 Just read the book. 
 You ruined the book, my book from when I was a little girl. 
 No. I-- no. 
 I trusted you, and you ruined it! 
 It's not your book! 
 Get away from me. 
 That was the wrong thing to do. 
 That was the wrong thing to do. 
 Blood is in the water! 
 Behold the dragon! 
 Blood is in the water! 
 Blood is in the water! 
 Behold the dragon! 
 Blood is in the water. 
 Get out of the way, man! 
 Blood is in the water. 
 Blood is in the water! 
 Behold the dragon. 
 Blood is in the water! 
 Move it! 
 Blood is in the water. 
 Behold the dragon! 
 There's this book. 
 It's called "The Velveteen Rabbit". 
 There's this book. 
 He thinks he'll never be happy again. 
 He'll never be... 
 He doesn't know that after everything bad that's happened, he could still be blessed. 
 I hope that can happen for me. 
 That's-- that's what I want... to be loved enough to become real. 
 You think you'll know sometime this year? 
 He'll know when he knows, Mr. Grayson. 
 Yes, of course, please. 
 Whatever takes longest. 
 Mr. Grayson. 
 Dear lord jesus christ and all beneficent beings, please, please, tell me you're ready to sign so I can resurrect this f*cking fiasco. 
 Griggsy, bring her up. 
 I think I'm going to cry. 
 Okay, let's get to work. 
 This is not dress rehearsal. 
 Why she is in costume? 
 She's in costume? 
 No. 
 Almost. 
 Interesting. 
 That was absolutely impeccable, Kiira. 
 Thank you. 
 Tech, reset for Cast "B," Please. 
 Brava, brava. 
 I told you, mon canard. 
 I don't go on stage to disappoint. 
 You win. You were perfect. 
 Now go ice that foot. 
 Hello. 
 That was great, Kiira. 
 That, darling, was prima. 
 Claire to the stage, please. 
 We're ready. 
 Claire, we need you on your mark. 
 Toni says you're not cutting it. Again. 
 She tells me you're hung up... 
 Being prima is not only about being able to dance it. 
 You're not special, you know that, right? 
 It's not there. 
 What are you willing to let go of? 
 Do you want this opportunity? 
 I need artists. 
 I know you want this. 
 Thinking... 
 It reeks... 
 Feeling... of mediocrity. 
 ...human beings. 
 What's your problem, sweetie? You're too thick. 
 Claire. 
 It's all yours. 
 Hey, fucko! 
 How cold you gonna let me get in here?! 
 Christ's sake, quit jerking your pud and get me out of this thing! 
 What, you get lost on the way? 
 No, god damn it. 
 That's not the way. 
 Don't grab. 
 I have to lift you. 
 No, you f*cking don't. 
 Just give me your hand while I'm grabbing the damn bar. 
 Just stay there. 
 There. 
 Hand. 
 Hand. 
 Jesus fucking-- aah! 
 Just let me-- let me-- 
 No. Don't. 
 Get your f*cking hands off me. 
 Dad, it's okay. 
 Take your hands-- 
 I got you, I got you. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 Don't you grab! 
 Look, I told you-- 
 I-I told you not-- 
 Hey, come back! 
 You can't leave me here! 
 Where's my goddamn cane?! 
 Bryan. 
 Hey. You're okay. 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 You're a big girl. 
 You're real, Claire. It's okay. 
 You're real. 
 I-I don't know what else I can say. 
 Come here. 
 I can't. 
 Bryan... 
 I need you. Please. 
 I got to go. 
 I need you to see. 
 I need you to see. 
 I need you to see. 
 This is Bryan. Leave a message. 
 It's me. 
 I just wanted to, um...be clear. 
 That was a mistake last time when I was home. 
 I mean, we both know that, but, um... 
 Anyway, Mia's not here, so you should just crash in her room, okay? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 I just wanted to be clear about that. 
 Anyway, um, okay, see you. 
 Okay, bye.
