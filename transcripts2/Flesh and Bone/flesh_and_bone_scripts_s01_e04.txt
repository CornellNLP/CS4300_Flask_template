 Previously on "Flesh and Bone"...  
 Whatever it is you did or didn't do with our chairman, he's decided to cease his support. 
 I'd like you to get out of my sight! 
 Paul : Things have become dire. 
 The American Ballet Company is in a state of financial emergency. 
 Daphne : You want me to go to my father. 
 There must be something you need. 
 I just wanted to say hello. 
 Sergei, I have a proposition for you. 
 What is your secret, Claire Robbins? 
 Any chance you could give me her home address? 
 Uh, I'm her brother. 
 Uh, you have a visitor. Bryan. 
 Soldier brother. Come on in. 
 Beau : Looks like an angel has graced our stage tonight. 
 Claire! It's okay. It's okay.

 [Door closes] 
 [Door opens] 
 Hey, can you just hang on a sec? 
 Look, I've been doing, uh, a lot of thinking. 
 Uh, if there's one thing the Marine Corps gives you, it's plenty of time up in your own f*cking head. 
 Excuse me. 
 Wait, just hear me out, all right? 
 Hey, I am trying to talk to you here. 
 I can't be late. 
 Would you just sto... 
 Jesus, what is with you? 
 I come 400 miles on a f*cking bus, and now you can't even listen... 
 Move. 
 ... to what I have to say to you? 
 Would you just wait? 
 Stop! 
 What?! 
 Uh, I... I just I thought... 
 [Door closes] 
 I'm leaving now. 
 I have class and then rehearsal and then... 
 Okay, I... I... I get it. I get it. 
 You got your new thing here. 
 We'll talk when you get back. 
 You won't be here when I get back. 
 I mean it. I want you gone. 
 Okay, list... 
 Well, you did it. 
 $250,000. 
 My father's accountant will wire it today. 
 Well, good. 
 That's... 
 A relief. 
 He made it very clear that this is to be a one-time, anonymous gift. 
 Is that understood? 
 I suppose that's best for everyone, isn't it? 
 What's this? 
 Our routing number. 
 Was there something else? 
 I just saved Paul's ass, your ass, and this whole f*cking season, so, yeah, I think maybe a "thank you" would be nice. 
 You're so right. 
 Where are my manners? 
 Daphne, on behalf of all of us here at the American Ballet Company... 
 f*ck you. 
 Oh, and congratulations. 
 I suppose you just made soloist. 
 I would've been promoted next season, and you damn well know it. 
 Mm. 
 You're probably right. 
 Though, I suppose now... 
 We'll never really know. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, you know how much I abhor gossip, so I'm only gonna say this once, but Emil and Dex, my Parisian friends, told me when Toni worked over there, she made the whole company rehearse "Don Q" 
 in the buck-fucking nude. 
 What? You think I'm lying? 
 No, I just can't believe you managed to work the "Parisian friends" into another conversation. 
 Close your legs, girl. 
 All that envy is pouring out your vag. 
 I can't help that I'm a global phenomenon. 
 Getting bukkake-ed by an Air France flight crew doesn't make you a phenomenon, it makes you a slut. 
 But I'm a  phenomenal  slut. 
 She said shoes today, right? 
 Shoes. 
 I'm so sick of sewing ribbons. 
 Seamstress? 
 What's in it for me? 
 Cocktail? 
 Two of my favorite things wrapped up into a single delicious word. 
 Gimme. 
 [Humming] 
 I swear, if you get any gayer, you're gonna fart a f*cking rainbow. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Does it hurt? 
 No. 
 A little. 
 Great. 
 We'll use it. 
 We're gonna use it all, people, every last f*cking ounce. 
 Hi, gorgeous! [Laughs] 
 Ohh! 
 [Drum beating rhythmically] 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 No, no, no. He can't lift you if you don't trust him. 
 What is that? Come on. 
 [Chuckling] Don't you f*cking pout. 
 Again. 
 Yes! 
 Yes. Better. 
 [Singsong voice] Thank you! 
 You're holding. 
 Here. Release. Yes. 
 Show me the  full  movement. 
 I want to see how deep you can go. 
 Yes! 
 [Clapping] 
 Commit to that! 
 [Singsong voice] Beautiful! 
 [Music stops] 
 [Dancers panting] 
 Holy f*ck, I'd give my left tit for something to throw up right now. 
 When are you gonna stop performing for me and start dancing? 
 When are you gonna stop showing me how  well  you move... 
 And start showing me  why? 
 [Sighs] 
 I need artists. 
 Do you understand? 
 Thinking, feeling human beings. 
 Not puppets. 
 Not trained ponies. 
 You want to be pretty? 
 f*ck pretty. 
 We're creating a piece about a young girl's journey from childhood to womanhood. 
 From her innocence, through her sexual awakening, to her self-knowledge. 
 It  demands...  
 authenticity. 
 It demands our courage 'cause it demands our most human truth. 
 Don't mind me. 
 I'm not here. 
 Whether you know it or not... 
 There's a part of your body you have yet to discover. 
 A fortress where you keep locked up everything. 
 [Chair thuds] 
 Believe me when I tell you I have come to lay siege... to that fortress... 
 ... because I demand that truth. 
 We are going to find it and bring it into the light, and we will find it together. 
 Your truth, that dark secret you keep locked up inside your most... sacred spaces... 
 Hidden from yourself... 
 ... especially  from yourself. 
 Again. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Greys! 
 Go greys! Disperse! 
 Permission to approach? 
 You're not gonna smoke it? 
 It's gonna matter more later when it's the last one. 
 And on the last day, I'll be the guy with the cigarette, and all these other bastards will be rightly f*cked. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Subway train rumbling] 
 You feel that? 
 You know what that is, don't you, Jimjo? 
 A train? 
 Right, that's what they call it, but then some folks say sometimes a rumble comes, the ground opens up, a black tongue reaches out. 
 Bodies get pulled down, down, down, swallowed whole before they even know they're dead. 
 But, yeah, some folks call it a train. 
 Well, what do you call it? 
 I know better than to give it a name, Jimjo. 
 I've seen it. 
 I looked right in its eye and lived to tell. 
 You want to know what I think? 
 I think you've seen it, too. 
 sh1t, man, do you ever shut up? 
 No offense intended, sir. 
 Apologies. 
 No offense. 
 You're right about one thing, though. 
 World's coming to an end. 
 I was born by the foot. 
 Breach birth. 
 I'm given to the sight and seeing of things. 
 You believe in that? 
 No? 
 Nope. 
 Why not? 
 [Scoffs] 'Cause I'm not crazy. 
 [Chuckling] Right. [Normal voice] Right. 
 There's nothing wrong with you. 
 But you do dream, don't you? 
 Last night, I had a vision. 
 Maybe there won't be no warning. 
 Maybe there won't be no sound at all. 
 I mean, I've seen folks... 
 Big ones, little ones... 
 Sitting on the side of the road. 
 And there came a white light and then heat and then nothing. 
 They were just gone. 
 There's nothing left but broken glass a... 
 What did you say? 
 I... 
 What'd you just f*cking say?! 
 Say... I... no, I... I just said... 
 Hey! 
 When you coming back?! 
 Hey! 
 You forgot your... 
 And... 
 No, I'm sorry, Ross. 
 Stop. Again, please, as if your future depended upon it... 
 Or, better yet, as if mine did. 
 Can we lose the shirt? I can't see the line. 
 [Sighs] 
 Again. And 1. 
 Good. 
 Watch the shoulder. 
 No. 
 Perhaps it doesn't matter to everyone as much as it once did. 
 But, personally... 
 I would hazard a guess that our dear Mr. "B" 
 knew precisely what he wanted. 
 I've been doing the choreography. 
 The problem is you're not centered. 
 Everything is over the right hip, so when you leave the arabesque here... 
 [Sighs] 
 She's something, isn't she? 
 I mean... 
 If you ignore the college dyke haircut and the complete disregard for technical precision... 
 I think Toni has a certain... spirit, don't you? 
 Honestly, it's a bit hard to take her seriously. 
 You know, her whole "power to the people" thing... 
 It's an act. 
 Yes, it is. 
 And the others... 
 What do they think of her? 
 I couldn't say. 
 They like her fine, I guess. 
 I mean, she'll never have  your  experience... 
 Your  way with the company. 
 Everybody loves you. 
 Thank you, Ross. 
 Let me see the arabesque. 
 There. 
 Shall we try another? 
 I think I can make some more time. 
 That's very generous. 
 I think I have it now. 
 You've given me a lot to work on. 
 Thank you... so much. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Muffled club music playing] 
 Sergei : You are beautiful girl, anyone can see this, but this place, this life, I think, is not for you. 
 You can't know that. 
 You are  ballerina. 
 You let Daphne dance here. 
 She's a ballerina, same as me. 
 Same? 
 My God, you do not even know what it is you have. 
 Is this what you need? 
 Why are you here? 
 I don't enjoy refusing you, but now I must ask you to leave, please. 
 If you want to see me, I'll be dancing at that club on 44th. 
 I think we are better friends than that now. 
 Yes? 
 I'd like to think so. 
 Eduardo : You had so many bottles, I didn't know which. 
 Perfect. 
 [Liquid pouring] 
 How come you never invite me over before, papi? 
 You don't like to share all your treasures? 
 Trinkets. 
 Momentos of past lives. 
 Everything in here is old. 
 But not you, beautiful boy. 
 Ay, papi, mte. 
 [Chuckles]  Eres tan apuesto...  
 Stop. 
 Yo no puede creer lo hermoso que eres. 
 No, seriously. I don't know what the f*ck you're saying. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 I'm  saying, 
 you must've had every boy in the city fighting to get into those tights. 
 Not all of them. 
 Most. 
 What's it like to be beautiful like that? 
 All those faces out there in the dark watching you, wanting you. 
 It... goes away. 
 One night, there is a thousand people standing, applauding, and calling your name, and the next, you're lying on your face in the wings, gripping the place where your Achilles tendon used to be. 
 And then... 
 They forget you. 
 Just like that. 
 I'd take it. 
 Even just for one night. 
 I swear, papi, just to feel that... love. 
 They could take it away the next day 'cause I'd get to keep the memory, you know? 
 Better you learn it now. 
 They're going to betray you, sweet boy. 
 Who? 
 Everyone. 
 [Clicks tongue] That's not true. 
 Well, aren't you the little optimist tonight? 
 The wine makes you sad, papi. 
 I don't like it. 
 Here's a memory for you. 
 Small town, statue of Robert E. Lee on the hill. 
 Little house. 
 [Sighs] There's a woman inside. 
 She likes... lacy curtains. 
 Puts plastic on the furniture. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I can still feel my thighs sticking. 
 And the man he smokes. 
 Doesn't say a word, doesn't move, just sits in that chair, with his RC Cola watching the TV. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 And the boy... [Exhales deeply] 
 He... 
 He can't help it. 
 He wants the man's attention, wants to... please him. 
 But he's shy and strange and... probably queer, and he doesn... 
 [sniffles] 
 The man only moves every other Thursday. 
 But the boy watches from the window, and then... waiting out on the gravel drive... 
 ... the blue car comes. 
 The lady hands the man an envelope through the open window. 
 It's the only time the boy sees the man smile. 
 Y... you okay, papi? 
 One day... 
 The boy goes to the man's desk to see what magic thing can give the man pleasure. 
 The boy takes the envelope, and inside... he finds a check... for $76.31. 
 And this is how the boy learns that the man and woman are not his mother and father at all. 
 These are merely foster people paid to tolerate the boy. 
 Imposters... paid to play house. 
 Pobrecito. 
 Don't. 
 I know how to love you, papi. 
 [Scoffs] There's no such thing. 
 Please? 
 I want to stay the night. 
 Are you sure?

 Please welcome to the stage the luscious Yasmine. 
 You heard the man. 
 Be good, baby girl. 
 Mama's got to go to work. 
 Hey. You got this? 
 I don't want to leave her alone.

 I needed to see you. How is that bad? 
 Because I don't see how that's a bad thing. 
 I mean, Jesus Christ, Claire, I am trying to... 
 I want you to go! 
 Right. 
 Yeah. Yeah, you made yourself clear. 
 Good for you. 
 So, what the f*ck am I supposed to do now? 
 Jesus. [Sighs] 
 Our whole life, it has just been us, always you and me and then everybody else, so you tell me, who am I supposed to be? 
 I don't know. 
 You want me to go back there? 
 Take care of the old man? Is that gonna be my life now... 
 Taking care of some sick, old f*ck who hates me? 
 Claire, I got no money. 
 I got no job. 
 The Marines... they kicked me out over some f*cking bullshit. 
 They kicked you out? 
 Yeah. 
 But what do you care, right? 
 I mean, look at you. You got a life. 
 If you think I'm gonna pity you, Bryan, no. 
 Hell no. 
 So you're just gonna send me away like I'm some stranger? 
 Never mind that I'm your flesh and blood, Claire. 
 I'm more than your blood. 
 Look at me. 
 What the hell is this? 
 It's at least $800. 
 I'll send more when I... 
 I don't want your f*cking money. 
 No,  take  the money. 
 No, I... wait. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I got something for you! 
 Wait, please, please! 
 Please. 
 I don't want that! 
 Please, it's a book. 
 You like books. I know that you do. 
 You're not even gonna look at it? 
 Please, come on, just... 
 I have a boyfriend! 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Claire? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know I've been struggling with the piece, but I think I'm making progress now. 
 I know I am. Today was... it's just not how I'm used to moving. It's... 
  I don't have a lot of experience with partners. 
 Stop. 
 It's not about your dancing. 
 I just... 
 I wanted you to know that if you need... 
 If you need someone to talk to... 
 Thank you for your concern. 
 I'm fine. I'll get it. 
 [Classical music playing]

 What is with him today? 
 Paul : I can't put my finger on it. 
 But, Ross... 
 You're just not [Tongue clicks] 
 living it for me. 
 Trey [Fingers snap] 
 please step in. 
 What? 
 Are you gonna make me ask twice? 
 Sorry. 
 Now, please. 
 There's still time to save this rehearsal. 
 Pasha, if you would be so kind. 
 Not until I'm ready. 
 Drop me, and they will never find your body. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Very well. 
 Now. 
 [Classical music playing] 
 Paul, there you are. 
 Paul? 
 Paul, stop. 
 [Sweetly] Toni. 
 Did you get my messages? 
 Messages? 
 Don't do that sh1t. You're avoiding me. 
 Why would I avoid you when I love you? 
 That makes no sense, but my schedule is killing me. 
 I have a very urgent... 
 No, we need to talk about your new girl, your star. 
 Claire? 
 Why? What is it? 
 I need warriors, Paul. 
 I need actual sexual human adults. 
 I can't do anything with some frigid, small-town virgin. 
 Just give her a chance to come out of her shell. 
 She's young. 
 She's scared. 
 Look, I don't have a choice. 
 I need to push her, and if she breaks... 
 Let me stop you right there. 
 I think you have to understand that not everyone responds to this whole... 
 Downtown, power-dyke, "v*g1n* monologue" thing you do, not that there's anything wrong with that. 
 It's great. You're a genius. I love it. You know I do. 
 Paul... 
 But I think once you have a bit more experience, you'll learn that sometimes artists have to be handled with a certain nuance, a certain delicacy, yes? 
 Fine, Paul. 
 She's your fucked-up, little twist. 
 You fix her. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Um, Pittsburgh. 
 One way. 
 That'll be $62. 
 Leaves in 20 minutes... gate 3. 
 Oh, yes! 
 Obliterate me, baby. Turn me into f*cking soup. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Uh, she's here. Do you still want to see her? 
 Mm. 
 Oh, f*ck. Don't you stop, you glorious bitch. 
 Oh! 
 [Sighs] 
 You, sit. 
 [Sighs] 
 So, Claire... 
 What is it? 
 What is... 
 I don't... 
 What's your problem, sweetie? 
 Your defect, your twat-clenching glitch? 
 My... 
 Toni says you're not cutting it. 
 She tells me you're hung up like some '50s housewife, so I ask again, what is your malfunction? 
 'Cause this Bambi thing has got to stop. 
 I'm working as I hard as I... 
 Bullshit! 
 Are you frigid? Is that it? 
 Did some dirty uncle put his funny finger up your easter dress? 
 Am I looking at the proud owner of the last American hymen? 
 I mean, what the f*ck?! 
 Uh, I... I... 
 What?! 
 Oh, Jesus, girl, spit it out! 
 [Sighs] 
 Let's talk about the problem. 
 Is this what you're afraid of? 
 Look at it. 
 This, my dear, is a dick. 
 That's what it is. That's all it is. It's a dick. 
 Nothing more, nothing less. 
 A dick. 
 It's a body part, Claire, not a bogeyman. 
 Now, go out there, get one of your own. 
 Touch it, f*ck it, I don't care, but you need to start screwing with something  other  than my livelihood. 
 By that time, I'm running. 
 He's chasing me, yelling like a maniac...

 This ain't a peep show, sir. 
 Nobody gets back there without a floor manager and a credit card. 
 Sir, are you okay? 
 Yes, sir, I am. 
 I think you've had a little too much to drink. 
 Probably. 
 Just full of good ideas, aren't you, buddy? 
 Okay, okay.

 Everybody gets one freebie. 
 You just used yours. 
 You come back here, we're gonna have a problem. 
 Don't. 
 Don't do it, man. 
 I've seen how this ends. 
 Ah, f*ck, here we go. 
 Hey, what are you doing? You can't be out here. 
 [Groans] 
 This is my problem. 
 All right, suit yourself. 
 You want us to give him more? 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 More.
