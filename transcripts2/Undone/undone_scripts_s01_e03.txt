 [RINGING IN EARS] 
 [MUFFLED PANTING] 
 [MUFFLED WOMAN'S VOICE] 
 [MUFFLED] Were you sleepwalking again? 
 [MUFFLED] Wait, what? 
 [RINGING IN EARS INTENSIFIES, STOPS] 
 -[NORMAL VOICE] Were you sleepwalking again? -Oh. I guess so. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [GIGGLES] 
 What are you doing? 
 Looking for my glasses. 
 You don't wear glasses. 
 -Are you sure? -[LAUGHS] 
 Have you seen my harmonica? [BLOWS RASPBERRY] 
 Ah! Ah! Stop! 
 No? What about here? [BLOWS RASPBERRY] 
 -Getting warmer. -[GIGGLES] 
 Did you move the photos in the hallway? 
 -What? -The photos in the hallway are in a different order. 
 Did you move them around while I was in the hospital? 
 -I don't think so. -Hm... 
 I feel like I'm losing my mind. 
 [ALARM RINGS] 
 [SHOWER PATTERING] 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] 
 ALMA: I know two weeks is a long time for me to be away. 
 That's like one seventy-eighth of your life. 
 But it felt like a long time for me, too. 
 I mean, imagine if your birthday came only once every six years, then none of you would have had a birthday yet. 
 And you'd have to wait a whole 'nother lifetime for candles and cake. 
 That's how long it felt for me to be away from you. 
 -What kind of cake? -Not the point. Try to keep up, Cassie. 
 -[CASSIE SHRUGS] -Yes, Zabeth? 
 Were you scared? 
 -I... [SCREAMS] -[ENGINE REVVING UP] 
 I don't remember. 
 You really don't remember anything? 
 The doctor said it's normal with trauma. 
 It's just the days around the accident. But it'll come back. 
 Do you have any scars? From the accident? Do you have any scars? 
 -Well, I... I do have this. -ALL KIDS: Ew! 
 -Maybe you don't need to lift your-- -What about that? 
 [PANTS] Oh, that's old. 
 [STAMMERS] My dad died, and I thought it was my fault. 
 But that was a long time ago. 
 What is "died"? 
 [RINGING IN EARS] 
 [RINGING IN EARS INTENSIFIES] 
 -[ALMA GRUNTS] -Okay, okay. Hey, why don't we all go play? Yay! 
 -[CHILDREN GIGGLING] -[ALMA SIGHS] 
 Now, hey. 
 I got it. Why don't you take a break? 
 [MUFFLED CHATTER] 
 -Okay. -And you can have more time if you need it. 
 -There's no rush. -I-- I know, but it's... 
 It's better for me if things get back to normal. 
 Yeah, sure! Or maybe even better than normal. 
 Like not flashing the kids or whatever. [CHUCKLES] 
 [ALMA CHUCKLING SARCASTICALLY] 
 [SIGHS] 
 -[SCREAMS] -It's okay. It's okay. I'm here. Your dad's here. 
 I know! Why do you think I said, "Ah!" 
 Where have you been? What is happening? 
 When do things get back to normal? 
 Things aren't gonna get back to normal. 
 We talked about this. Don't you remember? 
 I-- I can't do this. I can't keep... 
 Ending up places and seeing stuff and missing things. 
 No, you can do this, all right? 
 I know that you can because you will, because in a way, you already have. 
 Because time is a limited form of experience, you know what I mean? 
 No, I don't. I don't understand any of this. 
 Okay. I just-- [SIGHS] 
 Come here, I wanna show you something. 
 -See these blocks? -Yeah. 
 JACOB: Imagine these blocks are the whole world. 
 I mean, everything in the world, in the whole universe, really. 
 Like, this block is the pyramids, and this block is Julia Roberts, and this block is a grilled cheese sandwich. 
 Okay, so here comes Mr. Construction Worker-- 
 Oh, we like to pretend that's a lesbian mom. 
 Sure, it's a lesbian mom, and she's walking, and she's looking around, and... 
 And from her perspective, well, these blocks are everything. 
 But you and I, we're up here, and we can see, no, they're just blocks. You understand? 
 -Right, but-- -See, you're not really up here. 
 Well, you have one foot up here, and you have one foot still down there in the blocks. 
 -Yeah. -It won't always be like this. See... 
 It's kinda like driving stick shift versus an automatic transmission. 
 I mean, an automatic transmission's easier, but you're not really driving, right? 
 The car's driving you. So, I want you to... 
 Want you to close your eyes and take a deep breath. 
 And remember that feeling of the first time you drove a stick. [EXHALES] 
 -[CLICKS TONGUE] I've never driven a stick shift. -Really? 
 I don't know how to drive stick. 
 -No one taught you to drive stick? -No. 
 -Really? -Yeah. 
 -You don't know how to drive stick? -No. 
 -Your mom never taught you how to drive stick? -What, are we caught in a loop? 
 -No, man! -I just can't believe somebody could say they taught you to drive, and they never taught you stick. 
 -That's the basics! -Well, how about this. 
 You want to teach your daughter how to drive stick, don't die! 
 Well, if you're gonna use that against me-- 
 And you know, also, didn't you lose your title of "Expert on Driving Cars" when you died in a car accident? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! I told you, it wasn't an accident. 
 Someone was trying to kill me. 
 You think I would just drive so recklessly into a ravine? 
 Leave you behind like that? I would never do that. 
 -Who would want to kill you? -I can't know for sure. That's why I need your help. 
 -Why me, though? -Because you're outside of the moment. And you can. 
 I mean, every time I try to get close to my own death, I-- I get pushed away by the trauma. 
 I try to focus, but I end up someplace else-- 
 [ROSA CELIA SCREAMING] 
 TUNDE: Hey, hey! Careful, careful! You could hurt her. 
 -You okay? Say you're sorry. -Mm. 
 -I'm sorry. -It's okay. 
 All right, go play. 
 What were you doing? 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 MAN: [ON TV] The Chichimeca were a fierce nomadic tribe who lived north of the Valley... 
 SAM: Uh-huh. Sure. 
 Yeah, you know, I think things will probably sort themselves out with a little more time. 
 Uh-huh. I will. Okay. Bye. 
 That was Tunde. [SIGHS] He's worried about you. 
 -He thinks maybe you should take some more time off. -And he called you? 
 What are you, my dad? Where's my phone? 
 I thought it was weird, too. I mean, you probably know better than I do how you're doing. 
 And you're doing okay, right? 
 Come on, I want to show you something. 
 Dad, what if it's not safe for me to be like this? 
 What if someone gets hurt? 
 What if everything in the universe is predetermined, and people should take a chill pill 
 'cause they don't actually control anything? 
 -Is that true? -Look, you don't hurt people. 
 You help people. That's who you are. 
 Remember when you were eight, you went to that new school, and everyone teased you, even that stinky girl Rita? 
 -[GIRLS LAUGHING] -Yeah. Those girls sucked. 
 Yeah, and your mom and I, we got calls from the principal because you kept showing up to gym class without your uniform. 
 It turns out you were lending your dry shorts to Rita whenever she wet herself. 
 I probably just wanted to get out of climbing a dumb rope. 
 No, you're a thoughtful kid. You're kind and special and good. 
 Dad, I wish you could've seen what a fuck-up I've been. You wouldn't say these things. 
 Your core will always be your core, you know? 
 -I'm your dad. I know these things. -Of course. 
 The only one in my family who believes in me is the dead one. 
 For now. Do you know what I did? Do you know who I was? 
 You were a professor. A science professor. 
 -Science? Try Theoretical Physics. -I said "science." 
 Calling Theoretical Physics "science" is like saying John Lennon was a singer. 
 -Well, he did sing. -[SIGHS] 
 PROFESSOR JACOB: So, let's talk about time travel. 
 Theoretically, why is time travel impossible? 
 Come on, guys, we talked about this last week. What is the barrier? 
 The light speed barrier? 
 The light speed barrier. Thank you, Farnaz. 
 PROFESSOR JACOB: So, does anything move faster than light? 
 -STUDENTS: No! -ALECK: Superman? 
 -Quantum entanglement does. -Quantum entanglement does. Very good. 
 Now, how does this help us with time travel. Anybody? 
 Come on. No one knows? 
 Well, that's a shame 'cause I was hoping you could tell me 
 'cause I don't know either. 
 I lied. I know. 
 -What? -Quantum entanglement. Time travel. All of it. 
 Remember the research I was doing with the shamans? 
 I got one of our friends to take a spin in the MRI machine. 
 Oh, my God. This is a shaman's brain? This is amazing. 
 -If we continue down this path-- -The university's never going to fund Phase Two. 
 [SIGHS] If only we could get an independent grant. 
 Oh, you know what, I forgot to tell you, uh, we got an independent grant. 
 Holy sh1t! 
 I can't believe this... 
 What's going on with you and your little teacher's pet here? 
 I feel like you're honing in on the wrong part of this. 
 We're talking about rearranging the fundamentals of time. 
 Rearranging? 
 Sam? 
 -Yeah? -You changed the pictures again. 
 Well, yeah. You said they were wrong, so I rearranged them. 
 I still don't think this is right. 
 Honestly, I didn't even know they were in an order to begin with. 
 But how did they get out of order in the first place? 
 You know, I bet it was one of those burglars that breaks in your house and doesn't steal anything, but just moves stuff around to confuse you. 
 Right, one of those prankster burglars. Sure, sure, sure, sure. 
 Not everything is a huge mystery, okay? 
 They probably just fell off and I put them back up. 
 -Did they fall off and then you put them back up? -Yeah. Maybe. Probably. 
 -You don't know? -I'm sorry, okay? 
 You're not the only one who's had a rough couple of weeks. 
 Okay. Sorry. 
 [SAM SIGHS] 
 Look, you don't need to worry about me 
 -because I'm pretty much okay. -Pretty much? 
 I'll be more focused. I promise. 
 Alma, I consider you a friend, but I'm also, like, technically your boss. 
 And I have to do what's right for the safety of the kids as much as I sometimes wish the story time mat would swirl into a black hole and suck them all away. 
 I mean, that'd be pretty cool. 
 And also, a tragedy. And not cool. At all. 
 TUNDE: [SCOFFS] Okay, we'll give it another shot. 
 But if you're feeling weird about anything, just come talk to me, and we'll figure it out. 
 Okay. And, um, if you're feeling weird about anything, just bring your concerns directly to me and don't call my boyfriend. 
 -'Cause that's weird. -TUNDE: Hm. 
 I'm not sure you're the best judge of your emotional recovery right now, so I wanted an outside opinion. 
 Hm. Well, you don't need to do that. 
 Well, I'll do what I think is right for the safety of the kids. 
 Mm-- 
 JACOB: That was pathetic. 
 Where were we? Here, so... 
 Everyone has two, for lack of a better word, selves-- 
 -Dad-- -So, when the selves split-- 
 -This isn't working, okay? I can't do this. -Okay. You can do this. 
 -I want to help you, but I can't. -You will. 
 No, no, no, no. Listen, you're just going too fast. And I'm pushing you. 
 We're both learning here. We can do this together. 
 Okay, but... 
 I need to be able to function. You know, like, in the real world. 
 I know what you need. You need an anchor. 
 You need something physical that will keep you present in the physical plane. 
 Like a rosary, or a prayer wheel. 
 Uh, you know what? 
 -Where is it? -Are we in Mom's attic? 
 Yeah, well, there's this thing I became obsessed with. 
 Your mother wanted me to throw it out, but I knew it would come in handy one day, so I hid it up here. 
 I miss the attic. 
 When I was a teenager, I used to get high... scores on my tests by coming up here and studying. 
 -Aw! Come on. -ALMA: Hm. 
 Hey! Look at that! 
 [GADGET BEEPING] 
 -And still works! -Wait. 
 This is the thing that's supposed to anchor me to the physical realm? 
 -Electronic blackjack. -It's not the object, okay? 
 It's the act of playing it. The repeatable action. 
 It's complex enough to keep you focused, but it's simple enough not to overwhelm you. 
 You just focus on the pattern of the game, and that'll keep you connected to the larger universal timeline as it proceeds in order. 
 -Well, you know, in order-- -Are you for real right now? 
 Uh-huh, 19. I should hold, but... 
 -[DEVICE PLAYS VICTORY TUNE] -Boom! Still got it. 
 -[SCOFFS] -CAMILA: Alma! Vámanos! 
 
 
 
 -BECCA: Where are you? We gotta go! -Where do they want me to go? 
 -Oh, I didn't tell you. It's Saturday right now. -What? 
 What happened to Thursday and Friday? 
 Don't worry. Those days are jackasses. 
 -What? -Besides, you can go back to them anytime that you want. 
 Especially Thursday you should check out because you found a new Thai place that you liked. 
 -BECCA: Alma! What are you doing up there? -Okay. 
 -Here, take it. Oh, wait, one more. -[ALMA SIGHS] 
 -[DEVICE PLAYS DEFEATED TUNE] -Okay, it's yours. Go. 
 -ALMA: Becca! -BECCA: What? 
 Are you gonna have a Jewish wedding? 'Cause I wanna dance the hora. 
 BECCA: We're not Jewish, Alma. 
 But Dad is. Was. 
 Speaking of Dad, there was another person in the car with him that night? 
 Farnaz, right? 
 -Well, you know that. -No, I didn't. You never told me that. 
 Well, then I must not have thought it was important, or I would have mentioned it. 
 Or if it wasn't important, then you would have told me, because it wouldn't have been a secret. 
 I thought I did. 
 -Do you think they were having an affair? -Alma! No! 
 She was his student. That's all I know. 
 -[DEVICE PLAYS DEFEATED TUNE] -Damn it! 
 If you want to have a conversation with me, take your nose out of that game, hm? 
 Yeah, it's super annoying. What about this one? 
 I prefer the other. 
 -I'm not wearing a lace collar, Mom. -Yeah, Mom, come on. 
 Well, what do I know? 
 I've only been to many more weddings than either of you. 
 -Yeah, in the '80s. -Burn! Ya old, Mom! 
 Ay, Dios mio. 
 Can you please stop bleeping and blooping and help me for a second? 
 Just get one with a high waist so it doesn't hurt when you eat. 
 Do not do that. Everyone will think you're pregnant. 
 That's super helpful. Now, excuse me. 
 I'm gonna go get a decorative ring pillow for me to scream into. 
 -You're welcome. -Becca. 
 Do you think it's possible somebody wanted to kill them? 
 Alma! 
 I mean, why would dad just drive himself 
 -into a quarry-- -Alma, cállate,okay? 
 -I don't want to talk about this. -Okay, what about this one? 
 -Ah, beautiful! -Get it. 
 -Why did you even come? -Come on, you know I'm not good at this stuff. 
 You wanna go to the bar later? I'm good at that. 
 -Which bar? -The bar we always go to. 
 -What is that? What are you doing? -What? 
 Are you seriously bringing Sam with you to my wedding? 
 Why wouldn't I? 
 -You really don't remember anything? -Remember anything about what? 
 Okay, you know what, Alma? I am sick of this. I'm sorry, Mom... 
 [PANTS] 
 [GASPS] What am I-- 
 [GRUNTS, PANTS] 
 [PANTS, GROANS] 
 Because if that's the way you wanna live, then that's the way you wanna live! 
 Where did you get that game? 
 [DEVICE BEEPING] 
 [GASPS] Ow! 
 -You okay? -[GROANING] 
 -Was this couch always this far forward? -Yeah? 
 No! It wasn't! 
 Look! You can see the indentations in the carpet. 
 Hm. Weird. 
 I swear to God you moved everything around while I was in the hospital just to mess with me. 
 -Why would I do that? -I don't know. 
 I just feel like everyone's messing with me. 
 Alma, I swear to God, I'm not. 
 [DISTORTED CHATTER] 
 Whatcha got there? 
 Did something happen between you and Becca while I was in the hospital? 
 -I don't think so. -She thinks you're not coming to the wedding. 
 Oh! Well, you know your sister. She gets weird about stuff. She's a weird lady. 
 She's actually aggressively not weird. That's kind of her problem. 
 Weddings do always bring the worst out of people. 
 I guess so. 
 -[DEVICE PLAYS DEFEATED TUNE] -Damn it! 
 [SIGHS] 
 Mateo! What's happening? All right! 
 Oliver, my man! 
 Rosa Celia! Crayon up your nose! You do you, girl! 
 -Cassie! -Whatcha playing? 
 -A game. -I wanna play! 
 CASSIE'S DAD: Cassie! Right now, it's Alma's turn. 
 -Maybe next time, it will be your turn. -Oh. No, no, no, no. 
 This is an adult game. It would be irresponsible for me to let her play. 
 That's not fair! 
 Hey, Alma. Question. 
 Is it absolutely necessary for you to play that game continuously? 
 It kinda is, actually. 
 Uh-huh, well, okay, follow-up question: Is it--? 
 Doctor's orders. It helps me focus, and that's what you wanted. 
 You wanted this. 
 So a doctor ordered you to play electronic blackjack all the time to get better? 
 What, do you want to see a prescription or something? 
 Yeah, actually, I'd be really interested in that. 
 Tunde, I really wish you wouldn't get in the middle of a woman's health care rights and treatment. 
 [CHILDREN CHATTERING, GIGGLING] 
 -Okay, yeah. Enjoy your game. -Thank you. 
 -Bye. -Bye! 
 -Take care. -Take it easy. 
 Bye, Oliver! 
 -Say goodbye, Oliver! -Goodbye! 
 -Bye. -Bye. 
 Oh, you're leaving us so soon. 
 Wait! 
 Wai-- 
 Just, um, keep him away from the water, please. 
 -I don't understand. -TUNDE: Alma-- 
 -OLIVER: What's in the water? -TUNDE: Nothing. 
 -Nothing, Alma's just, just-- -Listen to me! 
 Right now. -TUNDE: Hey. 
 You need to get him swim lessons, okay? 
 I know I sound crazy, but I'm just trying to help. 
 Okay! It's okay, Alma. We'll sign him up. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 -[THUDS] -Ow! Ow! 
 -Hey. -ALMA: Hey. 
 What's all this stuff? 
 I stole it from my mom's attic. Don't tell her. 
 Hm... 
 I'm figuring out who killed my dad. 
 I didn't know that's what happened. Is that what happened? 
 Yeah. Pretty sure. 
 -So, uh, how was school today? -It was good. [SIGHS] 
 Good. Um, are you gonna come back to bed? 
 Yep, in a bit.
