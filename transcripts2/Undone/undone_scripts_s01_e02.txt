 [SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTANCE] 
 Dad? 
 [GRUNTS] 
 CAMILA: Alma! 
 Aquí. 
 ALMA: What are you doing? 
 Your sock was slipping. 
 -Please don't do that. -What about my socks? 
 Becca, you're not wearing socks. 
 -Why not? -Because you're a dog! 
 A dog doesn't have money to buy socks. 
 But I want socks. I want socks like Alma! 
 Ugh, this is so typical. 
 Alma! Be nice to your sister. 
 Dad! 
 Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! I want socks! 
 Well, why don't you go in your closet and get some? 
 -But I want Alma's socks. -Alma, just give Becca your socks. 
 No. That's not fair! They're my socks! 
 Okay, each of you gets one sock. Hmm? 
 -Everyone's happy? -No, Mom! 
 Okay, I think I've got this. 
 Come around here. 
 I will make you a special pair of socks. 
 Right here... 
 [IN FRENCH ACCENT] Straight from the boulevard, in Paris. 
 There you go, the latest fashion. 
 Daddy, I can't wear newspaper socks! 
 Believe in it, try it, try. 
 You must believe in the sock. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 -My goodness, you're ruining my socks! -[LAUGHTER] 
 [INAUDIBLE] 
 Are you waking up? 
 [MOANS] 
 Is she too drugged to talk? 
 -I'm going to get the nurse. -[ALMA MOANS] 
 Do you know how terrible it would have been for me if you died? [SIGHS] 
 Hey, Dad, can I go back out to get more candy? 
 [SIGHS] 
 I'll go with you. Don't tell Mom. 
 JACOB: I never got that story. 
 You know, you've got this girl, Dorothy, right? 
 She's living a normal, boring life, and she gets a chance to live an exciting life, and all she wants to do is go home. 
 Hey, if you had the chance to do something amazing, would you just want everything to return to normal? 
 I always think if the witch dies when she gets wet, she must have to be real careful peeing. 
 -[CELL PHONE RINGING] -That's very perceptive. 
 It's work. Hold on. 
 Hello, Farnaz? 
 Whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down. [STAMMERS] That can't be right. 
 [STAMMERS] Check on the-- 
 No. Don't call 9-1-1. 
 Do not call 9-1-1. I'll-- I'll be right there. 
 I will be right there. 
 -I have to go. -What? 
 You stay right here, okay? 
 No, not again, Dad. I don't know this place. 
 I cannot get home from here. 
 Stay here, I will be back for you. 
 Dad! Dad! 
 [ALMA SIPPING LOUDLY] 
 What were you doing without a seat belt? Hmm? 
 Not thinking about me or your sister, I can tell you that. 
 -This is the worst time. -Yeah, I'm so sorry I almost died at a bad time. 
 That was super selfish of me. 
 I ran into your doctor. 
 She said you can start physical therapy tomorrow. 
 Everything is gonna be okay! How awesome is that? 
 So totally awesome. Majorly stoked for physical therapy. 
 [LOUD SIPPING CONTINUES] 
 Well, I am majorly stoked that you're gonna get better. 
 I'm really sorry we had that fight, you know? 
 -I don't think I do know. -Okay, well, it doesn't matter. 
 -Okay. [SCOFFS] -We have so much wedding planning to do! 
 I need you to get better. 
 Yeah, I'm so sorry I've been slacking. 
 It's just, like, been really hard to organize things when I'm in a coma. 
 You're not gonna use that excuse forever, are you? 
 -Probably a while, yeah. -JACOB: No. 
 -Well, partly. -What? Partly what? 
 -What partly what? -What? 
 Sam's gonna need to get a tux. 
 He has his waiter uniform. Can he just wear that? 
 -Why does Sam need a tux? -For your wedding. 
 Why would Sam be coming to my wedding? 
 So now my boyfriend can't come to your wedding? 
 Okay. Um, you should get some rest. 
 I'm just saying, he'd probably be the only person there who likes Reed. 
 People like Reed. 
 [ELEVATOR DINGING, TIRES SCREECHING] 
 Wait... 
 Is this a dream? 
 -No. -No. 
 Well, partly. 
 MAN: Okay, um, let me know if you need anything. 
 Thank you, sir. I'll be fine. 
 Um, okay. 
 Hey. 
 [TUNDE GRUNTS] 
 [ALMA CHUCKLES] 
 Are we outside? 
 I-- I don't think so. [CHUCKLES] 
 -Oh. -Hey, the kids really miss you. 
 They, um, they made you this card. 
 Oh. 
 [LAUGHS] Oliver drew a butt. 
 [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
 Yeah, I think that's supposed to be a heart. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 [TUNDE CLEARS THROAT] 
 He's my fave. 
 Hey, um, I'm glad you're doing better. 
 I'm sorry for missing so much work. 
 No, please don't worry about it. You had a terrible accident. 
 You know what's weird? 
 You came to visit me before my boyfriend. 
 What are you talking about? Sam just left. 
 -He did? -Yeah. 
 Oh. 
 ALMA: It's beautiful. 
 I love your cards. 
 I actually made it weeks ago when you got in the accident. 
 I didn't know if you were gonna make it out of the coma, so I left it blank. 
 [STAMMERS] 
 I'm sorry. 
 For what? 
 -For almost dying. -No, no, that's fine. 
 I mean, not like "Oh, that's fine, you almost died." 
 But like, you know, "That's fine." "That's cool." 
 I mean, it's not "cool," but you know, it's not like not not cool. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Do you think everything's okay? 
 I think so? 
 Then, yeah, everything's okay. 
 Okay, um... 
 Let me know if you need anything. 
 Thank you, sir. I'll be fine. 
 Um, okay. 
 Hey. 
 Wait, so that was Sam? 
 Yeah, yeah. That was Sam. 
 But that happened before this, with the nurse. Didn't it? 
 -Uh... -I feel like I'm caught in a weird loop. 
 I feel like I'm caught in a weird loop. 
 Yeah, I get that. 
 What's happening? 
 Well, I mean, either you have one foot in the world of the dead and one in the world of the living and you're communicating with me through some sort of spirit realm, and the accident has shaken your temporal understanding of time and space and somehow given you the ability to see things in a non-linear fashion 
 -and that's all very-- -Disorienting? 
 Disorienting but also exhilarating and freeing, or this is all just some fever-dream, morphine-drip head trauma type of thing. 
 And are you gonna eat that whole grilled cheese? 
 [SIGHS] 
 I need your help. 
 And I can't let you leave here until you agree to help me. 
 -Help you what? -I think you know what. 
 [RUMBLING] 
 -No, I don't know-- -I need your help. 
 You've got to help me. 
 -What is this? -JACOB: Agree to help me. 
 -I can't let you leave until you agree. -I don't understand! 
 All right, let's try this again. 
 [PANTS] 
 CAMILA: What were you doing not wearing a seat belt, hmm? 
 Not thinking about me or your sister, I can tell you that. 
 CAMILA: [SIGHS] This is the worst time. 
 Well, I'm sorry I almost died at a bad time, that was really selfish of me-- 
 Wait, do we have to do this again? 
 -Do what again? -Where's Becca? 
 Isn't she supposed to be telling me how awesome physical therapy is? 
 She's in the hospital cactus garden. 
 What is a hospital cactus garden? 
 So, I ran into your doctor. 
 She said you can start physical therapy tomorrow. 
 Everything is gonna be okay. How awesome is that? 
 So we do have to do this again. 
 -Do what? -You mentioned we had a fight earlier. 
 What was it about? 
 -You don't remember? -I mean, I remember I was right. 
 Okay, well, you weren't, so it doesn't matter. 
 You can forget it. We can just think of this as a new start. 
 -Easy for me. -[LAUGHS] 
 I'm so glad you're getting better. 
 I wouldn't want my maid of honor to be in a back brace. 
 I mean, what would that look like? 
 I don't know, maybe like I survived a car crash, and I'm lucky to be alive? 
 Okay. Don't do that. You know I was kidding. 
 No, you weren't kidding. 
 I almost died. 
 And all you're worried about is I'm pulling focus away from your perfect pretty princess engagement. 
 For once, people are paying attention to me and it's killing you. 
 For once? Alma, you are the one that everyone always pays attention to. 
 I ace the SATs, and you drop out of college. 
 I win at the swim meet, and no one cares because you cut yourself-- 
 -So much for a new start-- -I turn 21, you get busted for buying pot. 
 -I was buying pot for you! -And don't even get me started on all your hearing stuff. 
 -All your special doctors and your special classes! -You think I wanted that? 
 I just wanted one year that was about me, and you ruined that. 
 I was in a f*cking coma! 
 [ECHOING] 
 [ALMA GASPS] 
 [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 -Press the button. -I tried that already. It didn't work. 
 -Press it again. -No, can't you see? 
 We're caught in a weird loop and I'm trying to get us out of it, but I need to focus. 
 -BECCA: Alma! -CAMILA: Alma! 
 [GROANS] 
 [PANTS] 
 [GROANING, PANTING] 
 I gotcha. I gotcha. Dad's gotcha. 
 I know this is overwhelming. It's-- It's all new to you. 
 Remember when you got your implant and you could hear for the first time, but your brain couldn't process it, couldn't make sense of it? 
 Yeah, it all sounded like bells, and ducks and robots. 
 Right, well, this is kinda like that. 
 You can communicate with me because the car accident, it kind of lifted the curtain. 
 And I need you to be able to communicate with me. 
 But now we have to develop your potential. 
 You know, this is kind of a new way of "hearing." 
 Am I losing my mind, like Geraldine? 
 No, no. 
 Uh, well, yes and no. 
 I mean, your grandmother, she didn't lose her mind. 
 She just lost her way back to reality. 
 You know, the reality that you know, well, that you knew, that you still know, and that you will continue to know, if we do this right. 
 -What are you talking about? -Some people's minds are more capable. 
 They can see more. They can feel more. 
 They can know more, all right? 
 And your grandmother was one of those people, and you are too. 
 One of those people? You mean-- 
 In indigenous cultures, people who can see visions and that hear voices, -they're the shamans, you know, they're the wise ones-- -Yeah, sure... 
 But in Western culture, those people are locked up, or they're put out on the street. 
 -So...? -So we need to carefully develop your potential. 
 Or I'll be put out on the street? 
 I don't know, Dad. 
 Okay. Again. 
 
 
 
 [BLOWING] 
 What were you doing not wearing a seat belt, hmm? 
 Not thinking about me or your sister, I can tell you that. 
 This is the worst time-- 
 -Where are you going? -[JUICE CARTON THUDDING] 
 I'll get you juice! 
 [ALMA PANTING] 
 Okay. Come on, come on. 
 Okay. Okay. None of this is real. 
 I'm the only one who's real. 
 I just need to focus. Come on, just focus and wake up. 
 -Press the button. -I tried that already. It didn't work. 
 -Press it again. -No, can't you see? 
 We're caught in a weird loop and I'm trying to get us out of it, but I need to focus. 
 -BECCA: Alma -CAMILA: Alma! 
 BECCA: Alma, wait! 
 -CAMILA: Alma! -BECCA: Alma! 
 Did you know that the word "chocolate" comes from our friends, the Aztecs? 
 Did not know that, Beth, but this one here is a real beaut. 
 Fine form-- What the f*ck was that? 
 Well, I don't know, but if she was made of cake, we got ourselves a winner! 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 -WOMAN: Do you like it fast and lonely? No. 
 No. No, no, no. 
 No, no, no. I gotta get out. 
 -I've got to go. -Hey, sit down. Sit down. 
 You were in an accident. You're in the hospital. 
 No, no, no, I'm not in the hospital. I'm home. 
 I'm home. 
 I'm home, and it's two weeks from now. 
 Becca! Get the nurse. 
 I'm in the kitchen with Sam. 
 And Jeff is eating out of her bowl. 
 It's a beautiful night. 
 -[JEFF MEOWS] -SAM: I don't understand what's going on. 
 Are you still mad at me? 
 No. 
 I just didn't understand why you didn't tell me. 
 Okay. So you're not mad at all anymore? 
 I'm not mad! I just... have a headache. 
 -You're still getting headaches? -It's no big deal. 
 I'm okay. Everything's okay. 
 No. 
 No, no, no, stay here. 
 sh1t. 
 You're pushing yourself too hard. You're not ready. 
 What are you doing to me? 
 You're letting the whole ocean in at once. 
 If you do that, you will go mad. 
 You need to let a little bit of the ocean in and keep your body in the boat. 
 Keep my body in the boat? 
 What you have is precious, Alma, and that's why I caused the accident. 
 You did? 
 I needed you to wake up. 
 'Cause I need your help. You're the only one who can help me. 
 Help you what? 
 That Halloween night that I left you, I wasn't in an accident. I was killed. 
 And with your ability to see what's really real, we can change what happened. 
 But I need you to say yes. 
 I need you to agree. 
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] 
 CAMILA: Alma. 
 Where have you been?! 
 I was waiting, Dad told me-- Where's Dad? 
 Where have you been? You scared us. 
 Listen, there's been an accident. 
 What accident? What are you talking about? Where's Dad? 
 Alma. Please-- 
 Stop crying! 
 Alma! Alma! 
 [SPEAKER BEEPS] 
 NURSE: Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please. 
 [SIPS] 
 -What were you-- -I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry I wasn't wearing a seat belt. 
 Sometimes, I only think about myself and not other people I could hurt. 
 I'll get you some juice. 
 I ran into your doctor. 
 She said you can start physical therapy tomorrow. 
 Everything is gonna be okay. How awesome is that? 
 Really, really awesome. 
 -Shut up, it is awesome. -I know! I'm being serious. 
 Oh. 
 Well, good, because how would it look if my maid of honor had a back brace? 
 I mean, would we have to get you like a special dress, or something? 
 You know I didn't do this on purpose, right? 
 I know. 
 I just need you to be there. 
 I can't have a wedding and not have you there. 
 That's not the plan. 
 The plan is I get married, and you're there. 
 And then I have kids, and you're there. 
 And then my kids grow up, and they get married, and you're there. 
 I need you to always be there. 
 That's the plan. That's always been the plan. 
 I can't do it if you're not there. 
 Becca. 
 I'm so glad I didn't die, so I could be part of your wedding. 
 I'm really glad, too. 
 Hey, you wanna wear my socks? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 Good job, kiddo. 
 What do you say? Ready to go home? 
 What is it? 
 Come on. You can tell me. 
 You were supposed to be there. 
 That was the plan. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 And I can't do it. 
 I can't do it if you're not going to be there. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, my love. 
 But I'm here now. 
 And you're here. 
 I need your help, so don't abandon me, Alma. 
 Don't abandon you? 
 I need you to make a choice. And I need you to make it now. 
 -We can't move forward-- -What choice? 
 -I-- -I mean, you can choose to tune all this out, and you can go back to the life you were living. 
 And just keep living it, and living it, and living it. 
 Or you could try something different. 
 A life that doesn't follow a paint-by-numbers timeline. 
 Or any timeline at all. 
 A life where anything can happen, at any time. 
 A life without limitations. 
 [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Remember what you said about silence the first time you heard it? 
 I didn't know it sounded so alive. 
 So, what's it gonna be? 
 CAMILA: She's awake.
