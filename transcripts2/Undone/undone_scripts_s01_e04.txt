 [LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS ON] 
 [SIGHS] 
 Alma. 
 Not with your hands. 
 Can I use my elbow? 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 Oh, I'm being ridiculous? 
 You want me to move keys with my mind. 
 No! Your mind? Your mind is nothing! 
 -Thanks, Daddy. -Not... 
 Not just your mind, everybody's mind is nothing. 
 Now... 
 Move the keys. This is easy. You can do this. 
 See this, Alma, this is "water." 
 Okay? 
 It's "water." Come on. You can do this. 
 It'll be easy. 
 Water. 
 I don't know what you expect from me here. 
 I mean, I'm not like a Jedi. 
 Maybe I'm just the princess with the rolls on her head. 
 Princess Leia. She was a Jedi. 
 Then why was she wearing the gold bikini? 
 She was enslaved. 
 So... not a super great Jedi. 
 Look, willfully break free of linear time and then move in time to a time when the keys aren't there, and then the keys will have moved. 
 -It's that easy. -Sure. 
 -Like that. -JACOB: Hey, Babycakes! 
 Did you see the moon tonight? Now that's a moon. 
 You should go check it out, catch some air. 
 [PIANO KEYS PLAYING] 
 See, "Babycakes?" 
 Okay... 
 So, I'll just skillfully manipulate time. 
 Why didn't you say that in the first place? 
 -That's so easy. -Just try. 
 Okay. 
 But don't try-try. 
 You know, just... 
 [EXHALES] Try not to try. 
 [VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Alma. 
 Stop staring at these keys. I asked you a question. 
 -Wait. Did I do it? -Of course you did it. 
 Look at all my stuff. 
 It's not really your stuff, is it? It's more like our stuff. 
 Because when you're dead, it's my stuff. 
 So, thank you for holding my stuff for me all these years, but don't worry. 
 I'll take it from here, okay? Bye! 
 It is a personal violation to take things from my house without asking. 
 I'm really sorry that I took stuff you weren't using, that you had no plans for. 
 That was a terrible apology. I do not accept. 
 [MUMBLING] 
 [GADGET CLICKING] 
 CAMILA: Stop it with that stupid game. 
 Hey! Stop. 
 You're messing up my system. 
 What system? 
 What are you doing with all this stuff? 
 I'm figuring out what happened to Dad since you won't tell me. 
 -I have told you everything. -You know there's more. 
 I think you need to see someone. A psychiatrist. 
 I have a follow up doctor's appointment in a few days. 
 I'll get it all checked out when I go to that. 
 Just don't worry. 
 -That is with the orthopedist. -Yeah! 
 You've experienced a lot of trauma, and you're acting even stranger than usual. 
 You usually act even stranger than usual, but since the accident, you have been acting more even-stranger-than-usual than usual. 
 Okay. How about this? 
 I will go see someone, if you let me keep this stuff. 
 Okay. 
 ALMA: What do you think? 
 -SAM: Hit. -[ALMA GROANS] 
 Twenty-two, that's the one you want, right? 
 -Yep, 22! -[LAUGHS] 
 That's what I wanted. Vegas, here we come! 
 Oh, don't look, don't look, don't look. 
 -[GROANS] -[GIGGLES] 
 And they go again, doing their little thing. 
 Do you have strong feelings about the Alamo? I am not aware. 
 You know, it's lauded as a state treasure, but it's where European settlers, who wanted independence from Mexico, because Mexicans would not let them own slaves, fought and died for their "freedom" to own slaves. 
 I don't think that's what they want you to remember 
 -when you "remember the Alamo." -No, no, no. 
 What they want you to remember is what they teach in schools which is Mexicans are bad people who want to take Texas away from its rightful owners. 
 Rightful owners? 
 -Bro, who we talking about? Huh? -Okay. 
 The Caddo? The Comanche? The Apache? 
 I mean, it's just insane how quickly economy corrupts ethics. 
 To the victors go the power to twist their story of greed into a history of systemic racism against Mexicans. 
 Well, as someone who is often mistaken as Mexican, I tangentially feel your pain. 
 What is it? What's the wedding emergency? 
 Uh... Oh! 
 Um, I would love it if you could tell Mom to leave me alone. 
 How is that a wedding emergency? 
 Well, if we don't deal with this now, I'll probably be bitching about it during your wedding. 
 -Wedding emergency. -Oh, my-- 
 -Okay. Let's go. -Ooh, come on, babe. 
 One margarita? We're here. 
 Can I get y'all something? 
 SAM: Yes, I'm gonna get the veggie Frito pie. 
 ALMA: Veggie Frito pie?! Where? 
 -New menu item. -[ALMA GASPS] 
 Oh, I'm gettin' that. 
 And I'm-- I'm gonna get the, uh, the Cadillac Margarita. 
 TOMAS: Anything for you? 
 Okay, I'll have, uh, the margarita. 
 REED: Ah! Great! It's on me. 
 -ALMA: Thanks, Reed. -SAM: Ooh! 
 -You don't have to do that, man. -I'm gonna go to the restroom. 
 Hey, don't worry, I'm gonna get you next time. 
 Okay, how 'bout this? 
 You and me go sharesies on that veggie Frito pie. 
 -Sharesies? -We talkin' pie pals? 
 -Pie pals? -Pie pals! 
 -Oh, hey! -Hey, do you need something? 
 No, I was actually just coming to apologize that I never texted you back. 
 But now you probably know why. 
 I'm engaged. 
 -Mmm. -Yeah. 
 That night was just like a big, drunken mistake. I'm so sorry. 
 Hey, don't worry about it. 
 -I'm a lot of girls' big drunken mistake. -Sorry. 
 Okay. Thanks... and for being so cool. 
 [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] 
 Oh. Hey, Sam. 
 -Hey! -What are you doing here? 
 -Um... -[GIGGLES] 
 -What's going on down here? -Uh... 
 Did you f*ck the bartender or something? 
 Oh, my God, did you f*ck the bartender? 
 -You f*cked the bartender? -Shh! Keep it-- 
 Okay, you have to promise not to tell anyone, especially Alma. 
 I can't lie to Alma. 
 Does she know that she broke up with you? 
 I can't lie to Alma about another thing. 
 Here's what's gonna happen. 
 I promise that I won't tell Alma that she broke up with you, and then forgot that she broke up with you, which you are totally taking advantage of, by the way, if you forget everything you just... correctly surmised. 
 I think I can manage to do that. 
 Okay. 
 [GADGET DINGS] 
 I didn't know you were so into blackjack. 
 Oh. I'm not. That's kinda the point. 
 -[DINGING CONTINUES] -What? [LAUGHS] 
 Oh, I get it. 
 Like, sometimes it's fun to do things you wouldn't normally do. 
 Like, usually at work, I like to look at sports websites, but sometimes I like to look at pictures of birds. 
 The reason that they can fly is that they got these real good hearts that can pump a lot of blood. 
 And I like to think about that, you know? 
 That a good heart makes you strong. 
 -Huh. -Like that? 
 Um, kind of. 
 Except opposite. 
 Oh, okay. 
 [STUTTERS] I think I get it. 
 Becca, do you remember Mom and Dad fighting in the week or so before Dad died? 
 I don't know. Do you? 
 Opposite because usually you look at birds online, but you're surprised to find that you like football scores? 
 Um, no. 
 But they did fight, though. 
 I remember it. It was late at night. 
 Probably. 
 Dad was always really good at coming home late from work. 
 And Mom's really good at starting fights. 
 Uh, opposite because you think a good heart makes you weak? 
 I like playing blackjack because it's simple, monotonous, and mindless. 
 -Ooh. -[CHUCKLES] 
 Okay, I see. 
 [IN LOW VOICE] I'm gonna go find Sam because he's less confusing to talk to. 
 It was great talking with you, Alma! 
 -Longhorns. -Hey! Hook 'em horns! 
 So, what was Mom harassing you about? 
 She wants me to see a shrink. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 -Well, is she going to pay? -Probably. 
 -Well, then, why not? -Uh... 
 'Cause I don't want to go. 
 Right, but what could it hurt? You're fine, right? 
 And Mom's just being Mom. 
 So, if you go, she'll know everything's fine, and she'll, like, leave you alone. 
 Yeah, but I don't want to go. 
 Okay. Then don't. 
 You know, I should just get it over with. 
 Mmm. Glad I could help. 
 ALMA: What is sanity? 
 Is it sane that we live in boxes made out of concrete, and wires and pipes? 
 Is it sane that we have to buy our food, and water, and land, and healthcare, and childcare, and entertainment, and that every part of our natural lives has been commodified, taken from us, and then sold right back to us? 
 -I mean, let's talk about that. -[GADGET BEEPING] 
 These are interesting points you raise. 
 Yes! [WHISPERS] Blackjack. 
 You know, patients who suffer from PTSD often use a prop to create distance between them and the world. 
 Something to divert their mind, or deflect others from focusing on them. 
 Do you think you could be using this game to create distance between you and what you perceive to be a hostile world? 
 Maybe... 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 ALMA: Bye! 
 Thanks. 
 How was it? Did she give you a prescription? 
 Yeah, something for allergies. 
 Allergies? 
 Yeah, she thinks that's what's causing the headaches. 
 -Headaches? -Yeah, from the allergies. 
 Mom, you really gotta keep up. 
 -What? -Okay, well, this was great! 
 And now we can all just relax and trust that everything is perfectly fine and leave me alone forever. 
 Race you to the car! Come on, slowpoke! 
 JACOB: Whatcha lookin'? 
 Ah! Stop sneaking up on me like that! 
 This is exactly why people don't like ghosts. 
 Farnaz's obituary. Why are you looking at this? 
 She had a big family. 
 Do you think any of them could be suspects? 
 Why would Farnaz's family want to kill us? 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 Maybe because you were having an affair with her. 
 What? No. She was a student. She was my research assistant. 
 And you loved her. 
 No! I-- We never... 
 I-- I loved your mother. 
 And Farnaz had a boyfriend. 
 Farnaz had a boyfriend? 
 Don't you know anything about murder? 
 It's always the boyfriend! 
 Maybe he got the wrong idea, and he ran you guys off the road in a jealous rage! 
 I don't think so. He was pretty dopey. 
 Well, do you remember this boyfriend's name? 
 I don't know. It was, uh... 
 Harold, or Gerald, or Darrold. 
 Darrold? 
 -You think his name was Darrold? -No, I-- 
 -[LAUGHS] That's not a name. -I can't remember. 
 I just called him Skinny Arms. 
 You called him that to Farnaz? 
 -Yeah, and she liked it. -[SCOFFS] 
 Anyway, he had particularly skinny arms in relation to the rest of his body. 
 You were so in love with her. 
 No. You're heading down the wrong trail here. 
 Look, we were killed because of our research. 
 All right? Because we were unfolding aspects of time that would have changed life as we know it. 
 [KNOCKS ON DOOR] 
 Hello! 
 Father Miguel said that I should bring you some cookies. 
 What? Why? 
 To thank you. For going to the doctor. 
 I was concerned about you, and you helped me to be less concerned. 
 It's called positive reinforcement. 
 -Just learning about that, huh? -Mm-hm. 
 Where has this priest been all my life? 
 So, what are you up to? 
 Oh, you know. 
 [LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS ON] 
 Not much. 
 Good, then you don't mind if I have a visit. 
 Shall we have a cup of tea? I'll make it. 
 No, no. 
 [CHUCKLES] I'll make it. 
 You just relax. 
 And, uh, don't touch anything. 
 .Bueno. 
 Are these out of order? 
 -Uh... -[WATER FLOWING] 
 No, I think that's right. 
 So... 
 Did you and Dad have a big fight right before the accident? 
 Because I have this memory-- 
 Oh, no, no. No fight. 
 Okay. 
 Wow, you're really chugging that hot tea. 
 [EXHALES] Well, I should get going. 
 Great. Uh, thanks for stopping by. 
 -Goodnight,.mija. -Oh! Night. 
 Oh! Oh, my God! 
 You're naked. 
 You're naked! You're naked! 
 -You're naked! -Shh! 
 -I like seeing people naked. -What? Mateo. 
 No. Keep your clothes on. 
 But I want to be naked, too. 
 No, it is much worse if you're also naked. 
 That's not fair. 
 Well, I'm allowed to be naked 'cause I'm a grown up. 
 Why do you have so much hair there? 
 Because it's natural. 
 My mom doesn't have hair there. 
 I imagine she feels immense pressure to transform her body to adhere to beauty constructs which are actually perverse and subjugating. 
 You know what, Cassie? Women-- Cassie! 
 Women need to understand their power. 
 Oh! Alma, what are you doing? 
 Uh, this happens sometimes, you know. 
 What happens sometimes? 
 I'm suddenly places. 
 
 
 
 -[SCOFFS] -Do you mind if I interrupt? 
 What is happening? 
 I'm thinking it might be easier to work with your consciousness in a dream state. 
 This is a dream? [SIGHS] 
 Thank God. [SIGHS] 
 Can you pass me a like dream-towel or something? 
 You'll be fine. 
 Okay, now move the keys. 
 I did it! 
 With the help of pissed off Mom. 
 Now replace 'em. 
 SAM: Hey, Babycakes, did you see the moon tonight? 
 Ah! Look at that! 
 Fantastic. You're getting it. 
 Yes, that's right. 
 "Water." Yeah. You're getting it. 
 [GIGGLES] 
 Okay, okay. 
 Yeah, but this is a dream reality. 
 Anything can happen in a dream. 
 Yeah, well, when you're awake, you're in a physical-based reality, so it seems more real than a daydream or a dream, but those states are just as real. 
 As your abilities continue to grow, these states will continue to blend. 
 You'll have a more flexible, fluid reality. 
 I think I'm already finding that. 
 Right. And as the blending continues, so will your abilities within these states. 
 So, you're saying I'll be able to move the keys 
 -more easily in any state? -Yeah. 
 Besides moving keys, you'll be able to navigate time, and even, you know, present yourself physically in the past so that you can affect change like... stop me from getting murdered. 
 Yes! 
 I'll use my powers to move Darrold's keys around a thousand times! 
 [STUTTERS] And he'll be so annoyed, he won't even want to kill you! 
 You leave Ol' Skinny Arms out of this. 
 Let's show you something here. 
 -You see what I did? -Yeah, you made 'em come and go. 
 -Dad, you see my powers? -Yeah, I did see 'em. 
 So now you want nothing to do with us. 
 CHARLIE: You didn't have a problem when we were writing you checks. 
 Charlie-- 
 -Who's that guy? -Just watch. 
 Why can't you just tell me these things? 
 Everything's a whole production with you. 
 JACOB: I'm sorry we ever took your grant money. 
 No, don't say that. 
 No, the research we're doing now-- 
 We're on the verge of something big. 
 -That's wonderful. -No! If we cross the threshold with American Freedom Corporation and you exploit our work-- 
 American Freedom Corporation makes the world a more peaceful place. 
 You make weapons. 
 Weapons that end wars. 
 Thank you for your interest, but-- 
 I'm sorry, but that research belongs to us. 
 Okay, you can have what we've done up till now, -but from here on out-- -That's not acceptable. 
 FARNAZ: Dude. Are you stupid? It's over. 
 Just take your blood money and go. 
 Farnaz... 
 Unfortunately, for you, this is not how this ends. 
 That's the guy who killed me. Charlie Vanderhorn. 
 Do you think he ran you off the road to get your research? 
 [TRUCK HORN HONKING] 
 -[ALMA GASPING] -[HONKING CONTINUES] 
 Well, that's my hunch. 
 And I'd go back and find out for sure if I could. 
 But that's why I need you. 
 I need you to help me not have to play that game all the time. 
 It's all about your emotions. 
 You need to feel them without letting them become you. 
 You know, like the keys. 
 Try, but not try-try. 
 How do I do that? 
 Just deep breaths, and be like the sky. 
 Let your feelings pass through you like weather. 
 ...not again, Dad. 
 JACOB:.These are all moments .where you felt deeply, .and the pain was too .uncomfortable to process, .so you stored them .in your mind's basement, .the subconscious. 
 .Even feelings you .don't remember.take up residence. 
 ALMA:.Is that me with your mom? .I met Geraldine? 
 JACOB:.Yeah. Even feelings .from your lineage. 
 [BABY COOING] 
 .My feelings. 
 .Geraldine's feelings. 
 .All of this, all these streams.of lifetimes of suffering 
 .are carried through .your mind and body. 
 .Even the good feelings. 
 .You have to let go .of those, too. 
 JACOB: Yes, baby dolls. 
 .They can't be who you are .if you want to be free. 
 [JACOB AND CAMILLA FIGHTING] 
 ALMA:.What is this one about? .What happened that night? 
 JACOB:.Oh, we had a fight. 
 .Sometimes we fought. 
 Alma. 
 Alma. 
 Are you listening to me? You need to take these pills. 
 What? What are these? 
 Is this what the shrink prescribed? 
 Did you go into my bag and get this filled? 
 -You can say thank you. -The cookies. 
 -Of course. -I did you a favor. 
 You know, it is a personal violation to take things from my house without asking. 
 This is an anti-psychotic. This is serious. 
 It's for PTSD. 
 Dr. June thinks I'm traumatized. 
 Probably from behavior like this. 
 Fine, blame me. 
 -But please take the medicine. -Please leave. 
 I don't like you right now, and I can't trust you. 
 Do you know what it feels like not to be able to trust someone in your own family? 
 Yes, of course I know what that feels like. 
 I need to make dinner. 
 Okay. 
 But take the pills, Alma. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 -[DOOR CLOSES] -[BREATHING HEAVILY] 
 [GADGET BEEPING] 
 [GRUNTING] 
 [PANTING] 
 [EXHALES] 
 Oh, f*ck! 
 [GROANS] 
 Huh? 
 Whoa. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 f*ck! 
 Okay. 
 Try-not-try. 
 Be like the sky. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [GROANS] 
 Hey, Babycakes, did you see the moon tonight? 
 Now that's a moon. 
 -ALMA: We need to talk. -SAM: Okay. 
 -I can't do this anymore. -Do what? 
 The way you look at me. 
 How do I look at you? 
 Like Becca and Reed look at each other. 
 Like I'm your missing puzzle piece. 
 I don't think you're my missing puzzle piece, okay? 
 -Why do you keep accusing me-- -Because you do! 
 You know you do! 
 And you make me feel like a crazy person 
 -when you won't admit it. -Alma-- 
 Why can't you just admit that you love me and that you think we're perfect for each other and that you already know you want to spend the rest of your life with me? 
 Okay. Fine. 
 I love you. 
 I think we make a really good couple, and I think we make each other really happy, and I know that for the rest of my life, I'm not gonna want anything more than just this. 
 I'm never going to feel that way about you. 
 I think you should move out. 
 [TRUCK HORN HONKS] 
 Hey, Babycakes! Did you see the moon tonight? 
 Now that's a moon. 
 You should go check it out, catch some air. 
 [PIANO KEYS PLAYING] 
 f*ck!
