 [SIGHS] 
 For those of you who don't know me, I'm Alma, Becca's sister and the maid of honor. 
 For those of you who do know me, you're probably all like, "Oh, God, who let her get up there?" 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Tomorrow, Becca finally gets to walk down the aisle to kiss Reed. 
 And although I am strongly against the whole "father giving away the bride" bullshit, as if the bride were her father's property now being handed off to her new owner. 
 I mean, the fact that we still practice this is complete insanity. 
 -Whoo! Ha-ha! -ALMA: See? 
 This guy knows what I'm talking about. 
 Despite all that, it's hard not to think about the guy who's missing. 
 Our daddy. 
 But I think he is here. 
 Because I see him. 
 When Becca smiles. 
 Oh-oh! There he is. 
 Or when we get the check at a restaurant, and Becca gets super into calculating the tip, and she puts on her math face the... Hmm. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 You... You've seen it. 
 Or when she gets excited about something and just somehow lights up the whole room. 
 I think that's Dad. 
 That's it. 
 Oh, sh1t, I forgot to say stuff about Reed. 
 Solid dude, firm handshake. L'chaim! 
 [APPLAUSE] 
 -Whoo! -ALMA: Thank you. 
 That was a good toast. Not too much cursing. 
 Yeah, I f*ckin' did that sh1t! 
 Okay, settle down, hm? Aren't you glad you're taking your pills? 
 Now you can relax and enjoy the wedding. 
 Yes! It's all thanks to these babies. 
 A zoom-zoom in a boom-boom. 
 -That's my good girl. -Mm. 
 Ay, dios mio. Your Tío Oscar's doing shots with the 14 year olds. 
 [LAUGHING] 
 -Aah. -[CHUCKLES] 
 Have you thought about actually taking them? 
 Just to see? Maybe they would help. 
 -Help with what? -I dunno. 
 -We need to run some trials. -Not now. 
 Oh, okay. 
 REED: Hey, sissy-in-law! Great speech! 
 Oh, yeah. "Sissy-in-law." Fun! 
 -You know it! -Hey. Ugh. 
 Hey, Sam! 
 You have to join me and my boys tomorrow morning. 
 We're hitting the links. 
 -I was just gonna watch TV-- -So you're free! Killer. 
 Hey, meet me in the lobby at golf o'clock. 
 -[LAUGHS] -GROOMSMAN: I'll be there! 
 Hey, you know what we're talking about. 
 -We're talking about golf over here! -GROOMSMAN: Mulligan! 
 You son of a bitch. 
 [LAUGHING] Hey, enjoy Reed's last circle jerk! 
 -When the hell is "golf o'clock"? -[ALMA GROANS] 
 -Okay, so you're all set with the schedule tomorrow? -Mm-hm. 
 Hair and makeup starts at 9:00 A.M., 8:45 just to be safe. 
 The wedding's not 'til 4:00, though. 
 I know, but I have to get my hair done, and then I have to get my makeup done. 
 And then, there's gonna be photos in the room of me getting dressed. 
 I thought you could be zipping me up. 
 Then, there's all of the group photos. 
 The family photos. Both sides. 
 All of the wedding party, starting with the first-look photo. 
 -First look? -Why is this all new to you? 
 You're on all of the e-mail chains. 
 Ugh, Becca. 
 Nobody reads e-mails. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 But I am your sister, and I love you. And I will be there. 
 I cannot do four hours of makeup and photos tomorrow morning. 
 Sitting in a chair while someone plays with your face sounds like heaven compared to golf. 
 Well, I'm gonna need to sneak away because I made plans with Charlie Banderhorn. 
 You're meeting up with that guy? 
 I remembered a fake LinkedIn account I created, like, five years ago under the name Amber Schwartzbaum-De La Cruz to see if this guy I was dating was cheating on me. 
 Now, Amber's convinced Charlie that she's an eager co-ed whose dream is to be a product manager just like him. 
 So she's gonna pick his brain. 
 I don't think it's the best idea to go meet up with some creepy dude who you think killed your dad. 
 Are you kidding? How can I not meet up with them? 
 -I just want you to be okay. -And I will be. 
 -I'm serious. -Babe! 
 You don't need to worry about Amber Schwartzbaum-De La Cruz. 
 She grew up on the mean streets of Las Vegas, and she clawed her way out. 
 [RUSTLING] 
 You're gonna be careful out there today, right? 
 Yeah. I mean, I am nervous. 
 But... [INHALES] 
 I gotta do this. 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 -It's my day! [GIGGLES] -[CAMERA CLICKING] 
 Oh, Lord, help me. 
 [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] 
 -[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] -BECCA: No, where are you going? 
 -No, no, no, I just have to-- Don't worry about it. -No, don't go. 
 Yeah, yeah. No, no, no. I'll be right back, I'll be right back. 
 Okay, but don't forget! The Courtyard at 11:00. First-look photo. 
 -Courtyard, 11:00, first-- -Don't forget. Courtyard, 11:00, first-look photo! 
 [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 -[CHUCKLES] Hi. -Hi. 
 -Hi, Charlie. -Amber. 
 -Amber. Great to meet you. -Great to meet you. 
 [CLICKS TONGUE] So, Charlie, tell me about the work you do over at Global Creation Associates. 
 Well, Monday mornings we have a big, all-company meeting, and then every department has to report on all the current projects. 
 Then, we get a little one-on-one time with the managers, then... 
 It's not a really competitive atmosphere, but I wanna win anyway. 
 And I'll generally have another conference call. 
 I mean, it's really, conference call after conference call... 
 -What? -Oh... 
 -No, this is really great stuff. -[CHUCKLES] 
 I kinda wanna know the stuff that they don't tell you on the tour. 
 -You know? -Oh. Yeah, I get it. 
 You want the dirt. 
 Do you ever do anything off the books for that big ol' company of yours? 
 Part biotech, part weapons development... 
 Bound to be a skeleton in there somewhere, eh? 
 Truth is... [INHALES] 
 I have done a lot of secret stuff. 
 Oh. 
 Why don't we talk about it some place a little more private? 
 Yeah, I'm at the Farraday all the time. 
 In fact, this is my favorite room, 'cause it's got this incredible view of the Alamo. [LAUGHS] 
 Ah. 
 -[DOOR OPENS] -Here we go. 
 [INHALES, EXHALES] 
 Alma, what are you doing? Don't go into a room with this guy. 
 -Dad, I got this. -Don't-- 
 So, where shall I start? 
 I'm interested in the work you did with outside researchers from 2001 to 2002. 
 That's very specific. 
 Didn't I read that you worked with some scientists from San Antonio University? 
 I think, uh, his name was Jacob Winograd? 
 -Yeah, w-where'd you read that? -Trade publication. 
 -Yeah, a trade publication. -Mm-hm. 
 -So, you're big on the trade publications? -[CHUCKLES] I must have been. 
 -Yeah, must have been. -Yeah. 
 [CLICKS TONGUE] Would you like, uh... No. 
 What are you really after? 
 I told you, I'm looking for information. 
 [CELL PHONE VIBRATES] 
 Winograd-Diaz? Huh. 
 Who are you, really? 
 I'm Jacob Winograd's daughter. 
 Seventeen years ago, he was killed, and you had something to do with it. 
 -Oh, I did? [CHUCKLES] -Tell me what happened. 
 -Why don't you tell me what you think happened? -You wanted his research. 
 -No. -You did. Your company did. 
 I mean, maybe at one point, but look, I'm really sorry that you lost your father. 
 I can't imagine how difficult that must be, but the work that he gave to us... 
 -was nothing. -That's not true. 
 I don't know where you're getting your information, but nobody wanted that research. 
 Somebody wanted it bad enough to kill him for it. 
 Sweetheart, listen to me. 
 You're not gonna get what you're looking for. 
 Okay? So, I think the best thing you do now, for your own sake, is to stop looking. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I can't believe you went in there. You've got to listen to me. 
 How am I supposed to go back and save you if I don't know what's going on? 
 All this detective work you're doing? 
 It's pointless. 
 People are either lying to you or they're lying to themselves. 
 We need to get you ready to go back in time, see what happened, and change it! 
 I'm late for the photo session. 
 [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] 
 [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
 -Alma, oh, my God. -I know, I know. 
 PHOTOGRAPHER: Let's cue the first look. 
 -I'll get the groom. -I'll get the veil. 
 -PHOTOGRAPHER: Thank you. -Becca, I know. I get it. 
 I'm terrible, I'm late. 
 Just, please. I've had such a day. 
 You've had such a day? It's my wedding day. 
 Yeah, you mentioned that. 
 Alma, cállate. 
 Look, just apologize to me, and let's move on from this. 
 -Okay? -I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry I slightly delayed your first-look photos, in which you present yourself in virginal white to the very man whose touch makes you recoil. 
 -Alma. -Yeah. 
 The one you so adore, that the moment you got engaged to him, you ran off and f*cked a bartender! 
 [CROWD GASP] 
 REED: Becca... 
 what's she talking about? 
 What's she talkin' about, Becca? 
 Reed, can... 
 [VOICE BREAKS] Can we talk? 
 Unbelievable. [SIGHS] 
 -Oh, sh1t, Becca. -What are you doing? 
 Go, go, go! 
 [ALMA PANTING] 
 [THUNDER RUMBLING] 
 Alma, oh, my God! 
 I know, I know. 
 -Let's cue the first look. -BETH: I'll get the groom. 
 -Alma, how could you? -I'm so, so sorry, you guys. 
 Becca, you look like an angel fell from heaven. 
 Mom, let me... 
 -ALMA: There we go. Now go get the veil. -CAMILA: Okay. 
 Oh, my God. Becca, you look beautiful. 
 -REED: Oh! -[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] 
 -Honey... [GIGGLES] -Oh, my God, look at you. 
 -BECCA: You look very handsome. -REED: You serious? I don't look like an idiot? 
 -I think it's a clip-on. -PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, perfect! 
 Wedding party should be on standby. 
 That was amazing. 
 You did it! You altered time! 
 -You actually did it! -I know! [CHUCKLES] 
 And it seems to be holding, too. 
 Please hold. Please let this hold. 
 This is great. 
 You're ready to go back to Halloween night and change things. Let's do it! 
 Really? 
 Okay. [INHALES] 
 Um, right after the wedding. Let's go. 
 No, no, no. Right now. 
 While you have momentum. You know, while you believe it's possible. 
 But Becca's wedding... 
 Yeah, well, you'll come right back here. 
 It'll be like you were never gone. 
 And I'll actually be here. It'll be like I was never gone. 
 Okay. Fine. Let's go. 
 [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
 Dad? 
 Dad? 
 -[HORN BLARING] -[TIRES SCREECHING] 
 [INHALES, GRUNTS] 
 I can't move. 
 Dad, help me! Help me, Dad! 
 [GRUNTS, SCREAMS] 
 Tell me everything. What did you see? 
 Why weren't you there? 
 I told you, I can't go with you. 
 But you-- you can do this on your own. 
 And you are doing it! Let's try again. 
 But I wasn't really there. 
 I was only half there, and it didn't feel right. 
 -We're doing this wrong. -That's the beauty of experimentation. 
 You can try and try again until you get it right. 
 I'm not strong enough. And I don't think you know what you're doing. 
 Well, try again. Right away. 
 I have a wedding to go to, which you don't seem to care about. 
 Alma... [SIGHS] This is all temporary. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 -[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] -[SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] 
 -You okay? -I'm fine . 
 -How was your jizz cookie or whatever? -Good, good. 
 I mean, it wasn't a game of jizz cookie, but it was totally fine. 
 We just drank beers and killed a squirrel with a golf ball. 
 I mean, I didn't. I would never. 
 But I just witnessed the crime and said nothing, so... 
 Alma, we're places in five, so don't dally, or get drunk like you did last night before your speech, which was lovely. 
 
 
 
 [CHUCKLES] Sam, I could use your help. 
 BETH: Hurry! 
 -Alma, where's your sister? -Mm. 
 -She's disappeared! -What? 
 Ay, I knew this would happen! 
 Bad things happen when you don't get married in a church. 
 -Did you try the bathroom? -Oh! That's good. 
 [COSTUME RATTLING] 
 [TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 What is the theme of this bar mitzvah? 
 I think it's "The Unknown Realms of the Mesoamerican Tribes." 
 Sammy's theme was "Cell phones." 
 [CELL PHONE VIBRATES] 
 -[SOBS] -[DOOR OPENS] 
 -Hey. -Hi. 
 [BECCA SIGHS] 
 What happened? 
 Reed gave me his grandmother's locket. 
 -Who's the dude? -His grandfather. 
 His grandma wore it for 72 years. 
 She died wearing it. 
 -Oh. That's creepy. -No, it's nice. 
 Oh, so why are you cryin'? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Because I cheated on him. 
 -Before your accident. -Oh... 
 -And then again last week. -No sh1t, really? 
 I don't know what's wrong with me. 
 I get in these long-term relationships because I want stability, and then something in me, like, freaks out. 
 That's why I pushed the wedding up because I wanted to force myself to commit before I screwed up again. 
 And then I just go and I screw it up again. 
 I don't know why I keep doing this! 
 'Cause you're human, and you're not perfect. 
 Which is totally perfect and wonderfully human. 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Maybe we're just two girls with a dead dad and a crazy grandmother, and we're just destined to hurt people. 
 That sounds harsh. 
 I never said anything like that, did I? 
 [SCOFFS] You know, if Reed really knew who I was, there's no way he'd love me. 
 He wouldn't even like me. 
 And I worked so hard to get into this tight-ass dress. 
 Of course he would still love you. 
 Who could help themselves? You're totally lovable. 
 Should I tell him? Before we get married? 
 Jesus Christ, you want to tell him now? 
 God, the guilt is eating me up. I can't go out there. 
 Like, it's gonna pop out of me. They're gonna say, "Becca, do you..." 
 And I'm gonna say, "f*ck bartenders? Uh-huh, yep. Sure do." 
 [LAUGHS] Okay. 
 -Do you want to marry this guy? -I do. 
 Well, then marry him! 
 And then go to counseling, I don't know. 
 But you can't tell him before the wedding. 
 I just feel so bad. 
 And you should feel bad. Because you cheated on your fiancé. 
 I know. 
 But that doesn't mean you should make him feel bad. 
 He didn't do anything. 
 Okay. All right, then after the wedding? 
 Way after. You gotta enjoy this day. 
 This is your day. 
 I'm just so sorry, you know? 
 -I'm sorry. -I know, babe. 
 Would you walk me down the aisle with Mom? [SNIFFLES] 
 You know, 'cause Dad can't be here. 
 -Becca, I would love to. -[CHUCKLES] 
 Okay. 
 Come here, you. 
 -I can't really move in this dress. -I know. It's really firm. 
 -Yeah. It's very tight. -You're very firm. 
 [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time, Mr. and Mrs. Reed Hollingsworth! 
 [CHEERING, WHISTLING] 
 [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] 
 -[MUSIC FADES] -[BOTH SIGH] 
 I know, it's a terrible habit. 
 But sometimes, when you're having a bad day, it just hits the spot. 
 Can I bum one? 
 [SIGHS] 
 -It really is so gross. -[CHUCKLES] 
 [ALMA CHUCKLES] 
 Hey, what was that dance you guys were doing in there? 
 -It's called, "La Antigua." -"The Old One?" 
 It's for the ancestors. 
 The copal, the smoke, calls them in, and the dance honors them. 
 I felt connected to it. 
 -Does that make sense? -Well, yeah. 
 All of our dances connect us to each other. 
 -And you're mestiza, right? -Yeah. 
 So, it's in you. 
 Even though you don't know the dance, you know the dance. 
 You should come see a ceremony. 
 -It's different from what we do in there. -How so? 
 We dance together for hours at a time. 
 Sometimes for several days. 
 Just trying to empty ourselves emotionally, spiritually, and physically. 
 Trying to open ourselves to whatever comes next. 
 You can dance for that long? 
 We find a lot of strength that way, through just being nothing, you know? 
 Yeah. I think so. 
 ♪ I want to be ♪ 
 ♪ The last ♪

 That's why I've been pushing you so hard 
 'cause I wanted to be here with you. 
 And it's been great, spending this time with you, and seeing how quickly you've progressed. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 And, yeah, my research in the wrong hands could be dangerous, but that's my burden. 
 Not yours. 
 And this is a special night. 
 Not only for your sister, but for your whole family. 
 You should enjoy it.
