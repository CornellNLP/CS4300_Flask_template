 Previously on How To Get Away With Murder... 
 You guys come to a decision yet on that football player? 
 Let's go. Let's go. 
 Griffin's gonna pin it on you! 
 Annalise : I'd like to ban any further discussion on the Lila Stangard murder, as I'm representing Rebecca Sutter. 
 Your client just confessed. Got it all on tape, too. 
 Oliver : Usually I require dinner before I agree to illegally hack into a rich old lady's computer. 
 I'm Kan. I spend my 80 hours a week at legal aid. 
 It's the only way to destroy the DNA. 
 [ Cheers and applause ] 
 [ Door closes ] Michaela, stand up. 
 We need to leave. Do you understand? 
 Michaela!  
 Laurel : Connor, stop! 
 Michaela, we need to leave now. 
 [ Whimpering ] 
 Just need to stand up, okay? 
 Michaela. We're screwed. 
 She's gonna ruin this for us. 
 She'll be fine. Are you blind? 
 She's broken. 
 Her little miss perfect brain doesn't know how to handle any of this. 
 Like any of us know how to handle this. 
 Michaela, get up!  
 Here's what we do. 
 You guys take Michaela to the woods. 
 I'll get Rebecca out of here. 
 Wait, what? You just... You're gonna leave? 
 She can't be here. You know that. 
 [ Laughs ] We're so screwed. 
 It's gonna be fine. 
 [ Pounding on door ] You're gonna have to trust me right now. 
 Asher : Hey! Hey, you guys in there?! 
 Who is that?  
 Asher. 
 I see your car in the driveway, Connor! 
 Open up the damn door! 
 [ Pounding continues ] Okay, what is he doing here? 
 That's my fault. 
 [ Laughs ] Of course it's her fault. 
 I mean, who else's fault would it be, right? 
 Asher : Is Michaela in there with you?! I want my freaking trophy back! 
 [ Thud ] Open up! 
 [ Pounding on door ] I know you're in there! 
 Laurel : Everyone, get down. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 [ Pounding continues ] Connor. 
 Are you bitches seriously trying to ignore me right now? 
 Let me in! 
 And you guys call me immature?! 
 I'm like the most grown-up grown-up ever! 
 [ Pounding continues ] We're so, so screwed. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Take off your clothes. 
 Did you run over here? 
 Yeah. Now take off your clothes. 
 I-I have to go to work, and I-I'm a little worried that you might be a s*x addict. 
 Oh. There's this book I read about this, "The velvet rage." 
 It's really... 
 We're young, red-blooded, American males. 
 Let's not turn s*x into a bad thing. [ Chuckles ] 
 I'm just saying, why don't we do something normal for once, that is not s*x? 
 Like have breakfast or... Or do the crosswords or whatever it is that actual couples... do. 
 Couples? 
 [ Chuckles ] What's next? 
 We change our relationship status on Facebook? 
 I meet your mom? 
 That... that... T-that is not what I meant. 
 You... I-I-I-I know that... That... that we're not, like... 
 You know what? I'll just take off my clothes. 
 We'll have s*x as long as you ignore what I just said. 
 No. No, no, no, no. Watching you freak out is way more fun. 
 Stop looking at me! 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 What did I miss? 
 Really, dude? Isn't your ass tired? 
 Who says it's  my  ass?  
 Shh. 
 Annalise : How are we to know whether the confession was coerced or not, Your Honor? 
 Ms. Parks has not supplied the defense with the video. 
 Because it hasn't been placed into evidence. 
 As such, I respectfully ask that the confession not be considered in setting the bail amount. 
 Ms. Sutter's written confession is in evidence, in which she admits to this especially heinous crime. 
 I would hope you would set bail at the maximum. 
 Your Honor, my client is a person of slim means... 
 Your client should have considered that when she confessed to murder. 
 I'm setting bail at $1 million. 
 [ Gavel bangs ] 
 A Millie? 
 [ Sighs ] That's a lot of lap dances. 
 She's a bartender, not a stripper. 
 [ Indistinct conversation ] 
 Rebecca, tell me the code to the phone. 
 [ Handcuffs click ] 
 Bonnie : This is normal... The judge always sets a substantial bail on high-profile cases. 
 What will help us appeal the amount is if we know the details that led to your confession. 
 That means you need to tell us every detail since your arrest. 
 Can you walk us through it? 
 Rebecca? 
 This is exactly what they want... 
 For you to curl into some dark place in your mind and stay silent while they define who you are. 
 Trashy, drug-dealing townie. 
 But you can be heard. 
 And it starts right here with us. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I didn't do it. 
 I didn't kill her. 
 You confessed that you did. 
 They made me say those things. 
 I-I just wanted them to stop. 
 I wanted to go home. 
 But they said that I couldn't, that Griffin already told them everything. 
 Wes was right. 
 Wes? 
 He told me Griffin was gonna pin it on me. 
 He was right. 
 It's your big mouth that motivated our client into a confession. 
 But all I did was tell... 
 Your behavior is starting to make me question whether you're working for the other side. 
 You better tell me, in detail, everything you ever said to her. 
 I... That's all I said. 
 Nothing else? 
 [ Cellphone rings ] 
 Hello?  
 Man : Who is this? Where's Lila? 
 You have to tell me what's on the phone. 
 No. 
 Oh, it looks like the trophy's gonna be in play. 
 He advocated for his client. We should all care that much. 
 You ever throw up in your mouth when you say stuff like that? 
 Michaela : Is that a tillman outline? 
 What? 
 Ward Tillman. He won the kepley diploma all three years at middleton. 
 His outlines are the holy grail. 
 This is one of kan's old outlines. 
 Oh, your boyfriend's giving you his outlines now? 
 What's next? Herpes? 
 How about we trade? 
 I'll give you everything from my property study group. 
 No. 
 Laurel, the exam's in three days. 
 And that's probably the first time you've actually gotten my name right. 
 Fine. 
 Sounds like it's shooting-star time. 
 Bonnie : Who's your pick? 
 What's a shooting star? 
 Hair gel's got ice in his veins. Doucheface is too dumb to care. 
 Wallflower's pretty sensitive. 
 My bet's on prom queen. 
 She's wound way too tight. [ Scoffs ] 
 What the hell's a shooting star? 
 We need a copy of Rebecca's confession tape and detainment logs, otherwise there's no getting her out on bail. 
 Be creative. 
 She took away the trophy, right? 
 Mr. Gibbins is off the Rebecca Sutter case. 
 You do not speak or even look at her unless I specifically ask you. Understood? 
 Let's go. We have a new client waiting. 
 Marren Trudeau is founder and CEO of the brokerage firm trudeau securities. 
 Her firm transacts $90 billion a year in trades. 
 She's the stockbroker of choice to the main line. 
 And owns the most extensive collection of mapplethorpes in the city, according to Google... baller. 
 Maybe she can sell one, pay Rebecca's bail. 
 Our client came from nothing, put herself through school by cleaning offices. 
 Started trading out ofer apartment, clawing her way to the top of a field notoriously dominated by men. 
 [ Elevator bell dings ] I need you to take this case seriously. 
 What's the charge against her? 
 Insider ading. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Telephone rings ] 
 Looks like my kind of party. 
 Abernathy : All we are doing is our job. 
 I can't!  
 Marren : Just doing your job? 
 Yes! Yes. 
 My ass. 
 Your goons are looting this place like it's a damn fire sale. 
 And you have no right. 
 Ms. Trudeau, this warrant says otherwise. 
 Oh, this warrant?  
 Yes. 
 Ah. 
 What are you... What... 
 [ Cheers and applause ] Are you kidding? 
 Enough. Marren. 
 Are you insane? 
 Annalise Keating. The exact charge? 
 Your client purchased stock in edson pharmaceuticals in advance of a favorable FDA ruling arising from insider knowledge. 
 Was any of that in English? 
 Annalise : I still see no proof of my client's connection to edson pharmaceuticals. 
 Right. I almost forgot that part. 
 Will you excuse me? 
 You want proof? 
 How about a little light viewing? 
 Now, Ms. Trudeau, do you have any idea who that man may be? 
 Elias Edson. 
 Elias Edson. 
 And that would be the CEO of Edson pharmaceuticals? 
 [ Sighs ] There's your proof.  Oh, yeah. 
 Ohh!   
 Well, take some notes, kids, 
 'cause this is what pilates can do for you. 
 Mr. Edson. 
 Oh, yeah. [  Both laugh  ] We all know the only reason you won't give us Rebecca Sutter's confession is that there's proof of coercion you don't want us to see. Oh, wouldn't that be so easy for you? Those dirty cops with their dirty interrogation techniques. Unfortunately for you, that's not what happened here. Then why not hand over the tape? We will if we decide to put it into evidence. 'Cause you prefer to spring it on us during the trial? You know, isn't that the fun part of court? Goodbye. Oh, and tell Annalise to send Frank next time. I prefer  him  watching my ass walk away. Marren : So I made a porno. So what? Everyone makes them these days. Not everyone. Pax! Really, so, you and Sam never get your... Never. All right, I know. We don't talk about your personal life. Yes? Get me Greg wallach on the phone. Tell his assistant it's an emergency. No one's judging you for making a s*x tape. It's who you made it with. I didn't buy that stock, if that's what you're implying. His assistant said he's on a plane to Belgium. He's dodging me. I'll send him a case of pétrus. Yes. And a hooker. Purchases were made under your unique login. I was hacked. Well, we'll have an I.T. expert look for evidence of hacking. Anyone you suspect? An employee? No, my people are loyal. Look outside of my firm. I have got enemies galore. Oh, you don't make history being liked. That's the woman I know and love. [ Scoffs ] And, Annalise, get this thrown out in the preliminary hearing. Marren, that's not possible. I've already lost 10 clients. It's $50 million out the door. Fed just took half my terminals. And if this goes to trial, firm goes under. That cannot happen, not because of some b*st*rd spreading lies. I'll take care of it. Thank you. Preliminary hearings are won by the prosecution 99% of the time. The judge only needs to prove that there's probable cause of a crime to go to trial, so the only way to keep Marren's case out of trial is to find the real culprit. Frank : There are 52 employees at trudeau securities. Your job is to interview them pretending it's case research, of course, until you find us a traitor. Happy hunting. How do you know it's one of her employees? I don't. I just know everybody hates their boss. [ Door closes ] She's right. I hate her. Careful. The house could be bugged. How are we supposed to find time to study for torts? Oh, are you one of those people that actually needs to study? You can't be naturally gifted at torts. Am I the only one that's psyched about this? We get to be spies! How did you get into the company? I was selling cars when I met Marren. She came in for an s-class *** she said if I could sell her that hard, she had a job for me. And ever since, never once thought about leaving? Hell no. Marren's good people. Like when my dad died, she gave my mom her house in the catskills for a few months so she could grieve in peace. Well, that's very generous.  Not really. You know how many houses she has? So, does that mean you don't make that much yourself? Gene : I'm somewhere in the seven-figure range. Depends on the day, really, whether the market's up or down. So, what's the most you've made on a trade at one ti... Do I sound like I am calling you from club fed? We are open for business, and the market is kissing 17 again, you punk-ass bitch, whose... Dress is amazing. Is it Prada? [ Scoffs ] No clue. I'm not like most girls. Clothes aren't important to me. "Top broker." Must be exhausting.  Not at all. We don't make excuses around here. Asher : That's quite the cat collection. You not here to talk about my pussies. What do you want? You mean besides world peace? [ Chuckles ] How is it working for Marren? Just between us, it seems like she could be a real ball-Buster. Would you call a man a ball-Buster? I'm guessing no, Mr. Can't stop staring at my boobs. Huh. Laurel : Illegal trades... They happen all the time, though, right? I mean, that's how we ended up with our current recession. Okay, that's liberal propaganda. Wanting and making money ain't a bad thing. And honestly, to actually pull off insider trading and not get caught... It's quite easy. An example... My brother-in-law's company, Denzotech, is being bought by Google. They announce it in the trades tomorrow. Should make a killing, but I have to sit on my hands because of my personal knowledge. But if you acted on it, you could make, say, 100 grand? [ Laughs ] Chump change. Connor : What about your colleagues? Think everyone's as happy as you are to work for marren? We all make bank. What's to complain about? Evan, Marren needs the dalzine numbers. Who's this? Connor Walsh. I work for Annalise Keating. Paxton. Pax for short. You two need a room? Why do I need to read these? It's all the pending litigation against Marren. That's what you should look at if you want to find the person who framed her for this. Oh, no. I'm not... I'm... I hope you're not as bad a law student as you are a liar. Carla : You want to ask me out on a date? Ask me on a date. But don't just take a sneak peek at the goodiesnner. Okay, look, I wasn't... The goodies are very, um... But that's not why I'm here. Why are you, then? Honestly... We think there's a Benedict Arnold up in this joint. Marren : How dare you? No, see, 'cause I told you it was an outside hack. So why in the hell are you interrogating my employees? As your attorney, it's my job to look out for your best interests. By creating a culture of fear within my company? A healthy level of fear all employees should have for their boss. Those people are my family. They're your employees, and they'll burn you the first chance they get. Oh, God. Aren't you just exhausted? I mean, you exhaust me. This isn't about me. No, you know, all the years that you've been my lawyer, through divorces and sexual-harassment suits, you have gotten to know all my crazy, but I still know nothing about you. Until now, of course. You don't trust people. Not your employees, your clients. Oh, I would be an idiot to trust my clients. Ah. [ Scoffs ] So, nobody. Nobody? Not even your husband? Marren, if you want to fire me... No, stop trying to wiggle out of this one. You know you're my best chance to beat this charge. Stop investigating my people. Oh, okay. What? Are you kidding? If this were my husband, I'd never be able to walk straight again. Are you going out? Department dinner. I told you this morning. Well... Are you sure about that? Mm. Someone's raring to go. Is that a bad thing? [ Sighs ] I'll be home as soon as I can. [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] McClaine's being a real hard ass about these dinners. All right. I'll be here. [ Dog barking in distance ] [ Beep ] There was a lecture you scheduled a couple weeks ago. Dr. Keating didn't show. Canceled last minute. His car was in the lot every night... except here. Friday, the 29th. [ Beep ] [ Door opens ] [ Door closes ] [ Keys jingle ] Can I help you?  Sorry. Just out for a night run. Saw the light on in your car. I didn't want you to burn out the battery. [ Dog barking in distance ] I'm not trying to steal your car, man. Didn't say you were. [ Engine turns over ] It's funny, right? We're driving so far out of the city to buy some lighter fluid when... we're already screwed. I mean, I hate to be all negative here, but Asher knew that we were in the house, and there's that... That eyewitness cop, our fingerprints and hair and... and skin cells at the crime scene, the fibers from this rug now embedded in my car, these street cameras recording us this very minute. Everyone say hello to the police. Hi! And let's not even talk about what we're going to do after the body's burned. now that... that... Is going to be the fun part! Enough, Connor. You're right. Why... why freak out about things out of our control? [ Chuckles ] Perfect! ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ 
♪  don we now our gay apparel  ♪ [ Chuckles ] The 11 employees I interviewed are either all extremely good liars or the hack didn't come from inside. And the I.T. Expert?  Inconclusive. So we've pissed off our client and have absolutely nothing to show for it. You've all outdone yourselves. Actually, if it's... If it's okay, I'd like to look into a possible new lead. Well, why you still standing there? Did you get the tape? Still working on it. What are you doing? Oh, my God. I totally thought this was my bag. Sorry.  You were trying to steal her outline. Seriously, Michaela? [ Chuckles ] Chick fight! Chick fight! Okay! Do none of you care about this exam? If we fail, we drop to the bottom of the class, and for what... to impress a woman who could give a crapt?! About anyone but her little butt boy here, who constantly screws up, but somehow gets to keep the trophy?! You want the trophy that bad, Michaela, take it. It doesn't work that way, dumbass! You have to win it, otherwise it means nothing! It's prom queen. You owe me 100 bucks. I am not the shooting star! Kan : Laurel? [ Chuckles ] 
 
 [ Door opens ] She makes you work pretty late. I'm compensated well. And what else am I gonna do on a Wednesday night? [ Beep ] I can think of more fun things. Be honest. She did it, right? Made the trade? You clearly don't know Marren. Does anyone know anyone? I mean, really? Wow. That was deep. You know what I mean. I've been her assistant eight years. There's no way she'd be stupid enough to make that trade. Right. I'll go. And you? What would you normally be doing on a Wednesday night? Or who, I mean? [ Chuckles ] Is there a boyfriend I should be jealous of? I do... [ Door closes ] What I want. Yeah. I know. I talked to a few legal aid funds, and they can put together almost $3,000 for Rebecca's bail. We need $100,000. Hey, we're not all working for big-bank millionaires here. She can't stay in there until the trial. It will mess with her head. What if we invest the 3 grand? Find a stock that we know might do well and then... What? You mean insider trade? No, no, that... That's not what I mean. I... Frank : Kitchen's for grown-ups only. And, yeah, I heard you talking about Rebecca. Do we need to get you a naughty mat? I asked kan to come help us with Rebecca's bail. 'Cause no one else is thinking about how to get her out? You, this is a place of work. Your girlfriend should know better. Frank...  Hey, hey. No worries. I'm just stoked someone thinks that I'm your boyfriend. [ Smooches ] Paxton : Never done that before. s*x at the office?  No. That other thing you did. [ Scoffs ] [ Cellphone ringing ] Oh, I'll go. No. [ Chuckles ] Look, only your boyfriend would be calling this late. No, it's...  I-I got to go anyway, all right? [ Door opens, closes ] Hey. It's fine. They still think it's her. I know. I actually just hooked up with one of the lawyer's interns to make sure. [ Laughs ] What can I say? I'm fully committed to the cause. And he did this thing to my ass that made my eyes water. Hey, guys. I think I just detached the Tibia. Or is that a Fibula? [ Chuckles ] Oh, there's plenty more of Sam to bag, though. Michaela, a little help. I just need a break. No breaks. We are in a marathon, and you've hit the wall, but we have six more miles to go. We have to see this through, so quit dilly-dallying, grab a trash bag, and let's get to scooping, shall we? [ Grunting ] [ Laughs ] Oliver : It's not that complicated, really. You just download this app from the deep web and worm your way into the phone company's mainframe using basic java code. Anyone could learn how to do it. I changed my mind. I-I just... I don't care. Hey. Don't be a bitch. I could get arrested for this. I would never let that happen. [ Chuckles ] Says the first-year law student, who seems to spend more time breaking the law than practicing it. How did you get this recording anyway? Were you, like, hiding under his desk, or were you already under there for other purposes? I would tell you, but then you'd be an accessory to my crime. [ Beep ] Oh. Voilà. Person he was on the phone with was using a phone line in trudeau securities. I mean, whoever it was was smart enough to block the identifying number. Dude. You love me, and you want to have my babies. I know. [ Keyboard clacking ] [ Knock on door ] Bonnie: Sergeant Joseph? Bonnie Winterbottom. I'm Rebecca Sutter's counsel. Ms. Parks warned me you'd be coming by. A little advice? Take a plea deal. I've seen the confession. It ain't good. Then explain this. If your department is so sure Ms. Sutter is guilty, then why is one of your detectives investigating a different suspect?  What? Detective Nate Lahey has been investigating Sam Keating, who also happens to be the husband of the woman detective lahey had an affair with. You're out of line. -  I have personal knowledge that detective lahey illegally searched through Mr. Keating's car last night. So you can see why I'm having a hard time accepting your confidence in Ms. Sutter's confession when, in fact, your men are still out there looking for Ms. Stangard's killer. I mean, a jury would definitely find it confusing. And if the press got ahold of it, well, it seems to me your whole department could come under review. The confession tape, unedited, now. Paxton :  What can I say? I'm fully committed to the cause. And he did this thing to my ass that made my eyes water. All right, turn it... Turn it off. Based on the phone call, we know that Pax was talking to someone inside your brokerage. And as your assistant, he had access to your login code. He set you up. He... he... He's been with me since my office was a desk in my apartment. He bought me my first pair of spanx. Even helped me squeeze into them. Okay, you can say it. "I told you so." The important thing is we know who's responsible. We just need him to make a statement. Oh, I'll get him to make a statement. You weak, little bitch. Marren.  Why? What? Don't play dumb with me. You set me up for this. I'm loyal to my boss. No one else.  Why, Paxton?! All I've done the past eight years is pay your bills, clean up after your dog, buy your tampons! My whole life has been about you! Serving you! Like all I am is some accessory, this thing to prop you up! This was my chance to be something. I loved you like you were my son. And this is how you repay me? You could have ruined me, made me lose everything! So understand this... I will make sure that you are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for this crime. Oh, and that family of yours, those... those people that just rejected you all those years ago, well, now they are finally gonna have a real reason to be ashamed of you, 'cause you're gonna be in jail with the other inmates who are gonna love the hell out of your ass! Marren! Marren! Your people are watching. Okay. Pull yourself together. I'm fine. I'm fine. Come on.  No. I'm fine.  Oh, my God. I'm sorry.  Paxton! [ People gasp ] [ Tires screech ] [ Woman screams ] Now you know what a shooting star looks like. We can request a continuance on the preliminary hearing, cite an extraordinary circumstance. Oh, you mean the proof of my innocence that just went out the window? I shouldn't have said those things, not to him. He isn't tough like me. I should have known better. You didn't do this to him. Annalise, I did. No. He was talking to someone else within the building, which means they're at fault. They committed this crime, not you. Let me fix this. [ Sighs ] Frank : According to the stock exchange, the purchase order for the edson shares went in at 2:48 P.M. Marren says she's was on a smoke break, so we just need to figure out who made the trade on her computer. Pax would have seen Marren leave. He could have told one of the other brokers to make the trade at her desk. Talia Lewis logged out of her account at 2:45 P.M. I interviewed her. It's all the pending litigation against Marren. She tried hard to steer me away from looking inside the company. Anyone else?  Jimmy Wordshaw. He logged out at 2:46 P.M. and logged back in at 2:57. - He was mine. Wanting and making money ain't a bad thing. The guy smelled like an ashtray. Wait. What if Jimmy distracted Marren on the smoke break while Talia made the deal and pax stood watch? Holy crap. We make good spies. Getting a witness to confess is perhaps the most challenging yet fun parts of being a trial attorney. Depositions in criminal cases are highly irregular, Ms. Keating. An employee just killed himself. If that's not an extraordinary circumstance, I don't know what is. We need to preserve all of the employees' testimonies now. Oh, are you expecting further deaths? Hopefully not, but we'll see how the day goes. [ Knock on door ] Hey, you ready for me? Jimmy. Sit down. You start with softballs, questions about their personal life, family, anything to warm them up. Sure. I take smoke breaks with marren all the time. And did you happen to take a smoke break at 2:45 P.M. with Marren on the 16th? Can't be sure exactly. Ms. Keating, where exactly are you going with this line of questioning? Marren bought the edson stock at 2:48 P.M. on the 16th, and that's the same time of day that you and Marren would often take your smoke breaks. Isn't that right? You're no longer a lawyer. You're a detective in an interrogation. I didn't realize it was a crime to be logged out of my computer system. It's not. Just wondering if you could tell us where you were at that time. I don't know. Getting coffee, going to the restroom. You sure you weren't buying edson stock on Marren's computer? Why would I do that? Take Marren down, start your own company using her clients. You don't ask for the truth. You pound it out of them, relentless in your pursuit of the answer you want. So, you and Jimmy didn't plan to start your own company? No. And like a good detective, you lie. That's not what he told us in his deposition. Talia told us it was your idea. I'd like to leave now. Well, of course we can't force you to be here against your will, but you will get a better deal from me if you answer more of Ms. Keating's questions. Talia's lying, okay? It was her idea. She roped me in and then Pax. We were just along for the ride. Mr. Wordshaw, you're under arrest. What? Wait. Hold... you... You said you'd make a deal. Prosecutors say all kinds of things. It doesn't make it true. And next time, you might want to read the evidence put in front of you. That deposition wasn't real? Look closer. That's a speech Marren wrote on the importance of female bonding in the workplace. Let's hear it for the greedy, little pigs. [ Applause ] Looks like you fattened yourselves up for the slaughter. I was just going what  you  taught us. You would have done the same thing, Marren. No. I would have  made  my own company. As I did. Did you really think that you could burn me? And you took trusting, naive Pax down with you. Enjoy your stay at club fed. [ Applause ] Where are you going? We have 14 hours till torts. I'm going to study. Will this help? The Tillman outline? Called my cousin. Turns out he was in an eating club with the guy at Princeton. Who wants a copy? Oh, my God!  Wes : Me! Okay. Suckers! You think I'm gonna let you all bust my curve on the exam? What? [ Laughs ] Kidding. Movie time. Rebecca :  Griffin was on top of her. Lila was shouting... for help, screaming, scratching at him. He had his hands around her neck. How did you finally get this? Wendy's assistant has a messy desk. Maybe something fell off. Good job. Detective :  You were standing during all this? No? You were sitting? Yes. Which means you were close enough to hold her legs. Yes. Sure have good taste, waitlist. Go back. [ Rewinding ] Right there. You were standing during all this? No? You were sitting? Yes. Which means you were close enough to hold her legs. Yes. Your Honor, this section of video was not a part of the written confession. Clearly it's because my client was manipulated into saying that she was touching the victim's body by the detectives in order to further incriminate her. She's reaching, Your Honor.  I'm not. The video completely undermines the reliability of the document. Objection. Relevance. I agree with Ms. Keating. The video shows coercion. In light of this, I'm reducing bail to $100,000. I am also initiating an inquiry into the interrogation of Ms. Sutter. Ms. Parks, I'm not happy. [ Gavel bangs ] [ Indistinct conversations ] I can't afford $100,000. It's 10% of $100,000, and we've got you covered. Rebecca, smile. You're going home. What are you doing here? I-I was in the neighborhood. It's 6:00 A.M. Well, early bird gets the worm, right? [ Chuckles ] Are you on something? No. I wish. You smell. What is that? Smoke? [ Voice breaking ] I screwed up, Oliver. I screwed up so bad. [ Gasping ] I screwed up. I scr... I screwed up. [ Sobs ] I screwed up. [ Breathing heavily ] I screwed... I screwed up. [ Sobbing ] I screwed up. I screwed up. I screwed up. [ Gasping ] I screwed up. I-I screwed up. It just shows that not everyone is born to have a high-pressure job. I mean, like this guy, got in over his head and cracked. Literally, his head on the sidewalk. Just...  Paxton :  I know. I actually just hooked up with one of the lawyer's interns to make sure. [  Laughs  ]   What can I say? I'm fully committed to the cause. And he did this thing to my ass that made my eyes water. I kept thinking there was a reason [sniffles] That you were so pissed at him. I was right. He played you. Come on. It's... It's not like we said that we were exclusive. Get out. Don't do this. I like you, actually. "Actually"? Look, Oliver, that guy, he was just s*x, but you're more than s*x. Don't make this a bigger deal than it is. Get out! Oliver.  I said leave!
