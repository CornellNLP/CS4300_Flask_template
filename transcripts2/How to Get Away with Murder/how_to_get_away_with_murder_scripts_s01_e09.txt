 Previously on "How to get away with Murder"... 
 Mrs. Walker. Do you have time for your future mother-in-law? I'm not signing the prenup. You stubborn bitch! [ Knock on door ] Michaela. Hey. Tonight is gonna be the heezy, fo' sheezy... Hi, there. Laurel : Who is this? Sasha... His girlfriend. Nate : I know you didn't kill Lila Stangard. And we both know who did... Help me catch him. Rebecca : Lila was pregnant. That's the evidence we need to tie Sam to her? Plug it into his computer. It'll download all his phone information. She took it. Did you bring your car? Bonnie : He kissed me... So I'd lie to you. [ Crying ] He knew she was pregnant. You're fired. No. Since Lila was pregnant, I'm demanding that they collect DNA samples of all the men in her life... Including her teachers. [ Students cheering ] I know nothing... About you, us. Why are you doing this? You knew she was pregnant. How stupid could you be? Bonnie? Of course she'd tell me. All right, just... Annie, wait. I lied, yes, but only because I was afraid you'd think I killed her. Didn't you? No. God, no. Annie, please. J... You lie so much, your words mean nothing to me. You  mean nothing to me. Will you just stop for one second?! No! I'm done saving your ass! I'm done believing in you! I'm done loving you! Get out of this house! I am begging you... Do not give up on me. I already have. I'm your husband. I love you. Get out of this house, or I'm gonna call 911! [ Dialing ] I am not leaving until you talk to me! [ Students cheering ] If one of these idiots touches my car, I'm gonna run them over. It's Rebecca.   Don't leave me a message. Still not picking up? Hey, how do you know that she's even at Annalise's? I mean, maybe she got hungry or went to score some drugs. She went there. I know that that's what you keep saying, but I'm suggesting otherwise. I mean, even if she's there, what does it matter? We have to study.  The exam... Sam killed Lila, okay? That's  why she's going over there. She's trying to prove it. Sam : I'm not a violent man, Annie. Everyone's violent given the chance. No. Not me. You know that. I tried to believe you this whole time. Just calm down. I didn't listen to myself. I am still the man you married. You are not that man anymore! And I don't think you ever were, which is why you chose me, isn't it? I've been the window dressing for you... The black woman on your arm so you can hide, so that people only saw the good guy. And maybe it took me 20 years to see it, but I do now... I see it! And that's why you killed Lila... Because she was pregnant, and you knew that if it got out, people would see you for the pathetic man you are! If you think I killed her, why not just go to the police? Why get them to run a DNA test instead? It's so you can cover your own ass, because that's who  you  are... Some scared little girl who pretends to be strong but is really just weak and selfish. I did everything I could to protect you! You've done nothing but make my life miserable! I've been screwing another man. Connor : Wait. You're serious? This isn't a-a joke? I don't care if you believe me. Just drive faster. [ Laughs ] Are you hearing this? I mean... Why would Annalise defend Rebecca if she thought Sam was involved? Because I said I'd go to the police if she didn't. [ Laughing ] Oh. Right. You blackmailed Annalise. The kid that was so scared that he almost crapped his pants on the first day of class. This is ridiculous.  Connor, shut up. You think Sam killed Lila? Yes. [ Laughs ] Oh, this night just gets better and better. [ Laughs ] His name is Nate. And, boy, is he good to me. He knows me... Just what I like and how I like it. He knows how to make me scream and groan and sweat. And so I let him take me wherever he wants... On this counter, on my desk, in our bed. You hypocrite. Just thinking about him right now makes me... Shaming me for cheating all this time. Which is how I could sleep with you all these months, because I would think about him and I'd be able to stand you on top of me! And I think of Lila every time I try to get off with  you! I bet you did. Killing her, huh? You enjoyed it, didn't you? Strangling her? Feeling the life go out of her body? You still think about it, don't you? Your hand around her neck while you were still inside of her. It's exciting you right now, isn't it? Remembering it? You want to do it to  me  now, don't you? Go ahead. Kill me. Kill me. [ Breathing shakily ] Kill me! You're a monster. "Monster," huh? Is that all you got? You can do better than that. You want the truth? You're nothing but a piece of ass. That's what I saw when I first talked to you in the office that day... 'Cause I knew you'd put out. That's all you're really good for... Dirty, rough s*x that I'm too ashamed to tell anyone about. That's how foul you are, you disgusting slut. Well... At least you were finally able to tell the truth. [ Door opens ] [ Students cheering ] [ Door opens ] [ Door closes ] Oh. Hi. Mr. Keating. What do you want? Is Professor Keating around? She's not here. Any idea when she'll be back? No. You should... You should go. I'll just wait, if I can. I really need to turn this in to get out of our exam. Just leave it on her desk. See, that's the thing. It's, um, it's a little more complicated than that. Rebecca? What is this? Why are you both here? I'm just here to turn in the trophy. Is... something wrong? Call Wes. [ Door slams ] Unlock the door, Rebecca. [ Doorknob rattles ] [ Cellphone rings ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Michaela? Whoa, whoa. Michaela, slow down. Who's fighting? Rebecca and Sam. I think he's drunk. Quit playing around and open the door. Is Annalise there? No! And Rebecca's locked herself inside their bedroom. What are you doing in there? What the hell is this?! Sam killed Lila, and Rebecca's trying to prove it. Open the door, Rebecca. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. What? I'd pay to see her face right now. No. What did you just say? You can't leave her alone with him. Promise me you won't leave. [ Pounding on door ] Come out, or I'm calling the police. Oh, my God! What's he doing? I... ah... I... Open the door, Rebecca! H-he's just screaming. Michaela, talk to me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Y-you need to get here. This is bad. Connor, go. Go. [ Voice breaking ] Really, really bad. Sam : I said open the damn door! What's happening? [ Screams ] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Michaela! Answer me! Michaela! - You have to get here right now! You have to get here right now! Michaela : Please, Mr. Keating, stop! If you just calm down, we can figure this out. Come out or I'm coming in! [ Doorknob rattling ] Wes : Stop! Get out of my house. Let her go, then we'll leave. She took my computer. What the hell is she trying to get? I don't know. Just... calm down, and we'll leave. Rebecca, it's me. You can come out now. Give me a minute. [ Beep ] Okay, I'm coming. Good. I'm here. What did you do? Nothing. I didn't find anything. We'll leave now. Just let us go. I'm not gonna do anything. Michaela : Oh, my God! Get off! Grab it! [ Gasps ] Laurel! Aah! Aaaaah! Aaaah! Oh, God. Oh, God, no. Michaela : [ Voice breaking ] We need to call an ambulance. Connor : Why? He's dead. You killed him, Michaela. Me? H-he was coming at us. Yeah, and he was alive, until you shoved him over the railing. I was protecting Laurel. She was. Fine. Then you  both  killed him. So did you, then. No, no, no. I didn't do anything. It doesn't matter what any of us did. We were all here, which means we're all at fault. What are you talking about? Rebecca was stealing private information off of Sam's computer. That's a felony. And because we were all helping her, we could be charged with felony murder. No, no, no, no, no, no, no prosecutor would do that. We were defending ourselves. We broke into his house.  He  was defending  himself. I was just trying to turn in the trophy. What? I wasn't part of your plan is all, so I... There was no plan, okay? That was all  her. I didn't ask for anyone's help. Fine. Then we can thank your boyfriend for that. Shouldn't we be calling the ambulance? I think you mean the police, idiot. He's dead! Fine. Then the police. But we can't just sit here and do nothing. No. Think. No one knows we were here. Annalise could be home any minute. Which is why we should leave. You want to run? I'm just saying... he fell after drinking too much. My car is outside. Anyone could've seen it. Your car's here all of the time. No, we should call the police and tell them everything. But Rebecca can't afford to... I don't care about Rebecca right now! I care about my future! But  you  did this! Just like we all did. He's dead because of  all  of us. And maybe that's okay. He killed Lila and was gonna let Rebecca go down for it. [ Rebecca gasping ] It's not... Oh, my God! Do something! Get him off her!  Do something!! [ Breathing shakily ] [ Crying ] He's dead. He's dead. We have to go... Right now. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. [ Breathing shakily ] You okay? We need to clean you up and get out of here. Okay. Get ready to leave. [ Clears throat ] Where are you going? [ Coughing ] Connor : Wes! Hurry the hell up! Come on. What? Thank you. It's gonna be fine. Michaela, we need to leave now. Just need to stand up, okay? Wes : Here's what we do. You guys take Michaela to the woods. I'll get Rebecca out of here. Wait. What... you just... You're gonna leave? She can't be here. You know that. [ Laughs ] We're so screwed. It's gonna be fine. You're gonna have to trust me right now. Asher : Hey! Are you guys in there?! Rebecca : Who is that? Wes : Asher. I see your car in the driveway, Connor! Open up the damn door! Okay, what is he doing here? [ Pounding on door ] Everyone, get down. [ Laughs ] [ Pounding continues ] Connor. Are you bitches seriously trying to ignore me right now?! Let me in! And you guys call  me  immature? I'm, like, the most grown-up grown-up ever compared to your dumb asses! [ Pounding continues ] We should just let him in. If he's been in the house, he'll... He'll suddenly be a part of it, you know? The five of us have witnessed him here. Then daddy Millstone can help get us off. We could get him to step in the blood. It's not a bad idea. Yeah. No! He wasn't part of this. Do you think that I  wanted to be a part of this? Wait. Listen. [ Sighs ] He's gone. [ Students cheering ] [ Iamx's "Walk with the noise" plays ] Screw it. And in other news,   the d.A.'S office has elected to institute a voluntary DNA dragnet, looking for samples from men connected to murder victim Lila Stangard.. They are trying to find the man responsible for impregnating her before her death. It's crazy, right? First they think it's the boyfriend and the bartender. Then they think it's her secret lover. [ Chuckling ] I'm just relieved I didn't know the girl. I don't want no police keeping my DNA on file. You've got secrets to hide? Investigators tell us they expect full cooperation... Don't we all? ♪ Always killing me, killing me slowly ♪ [ Students cheering ] ♪ Wanna wash those smiles away ♪ ♪ I walk with the noise ♪ ♪ it's reaching out to me ♪ ♪ I talk to the walls ♪ ♪ face my devils ♪ ♪ when I'm losing my touch ♪ Wes : Don't do anything until I'm back. Okay? He wanted to kill me. I had no other choice. No. I had to kill him, or he was gonna kill  me. I saw the trophy sitting there. No. I hit him in the head. He deserved to die. Why are you saying this? And I'm glad he's dead. Stop it. Stop it! No! Look, my trial's in a couple days. I'm already going to jail. And now  you  might, too, because of me, and I will kill myself if that happens. So, please... please just let me help  you  for once. The only thing you can do to help right now is stay in this room and not leave. I'll be back as soon as I can. [ Students cheering ] Laurel : Do something. Michaela : Get him off her! Do something!! [ Horn blares ] Man : Hey! Asshat! Sometime this year, will ya? I'm so sorry. [ Students cheering ] What if they got caught or went to the police or she convinced him to pin it on us? Wes wouldn't do that. Think about it. How we got here... It's all her fault. It's not her fault. Connor : Stop acting like a little bitch baby. Do not tell me how to feel right now! Wes : Hey! Aah! Sorry it took so long. I went back for this. Now, you... You take that back right now! No. It's smart. Commonwealth v. Deloatche... A case the prosecution should've won but lost because there was no murder weapon. So, what are you saying? We clean it and we put it back. Hide it in plain sight. After we bury the body. No. Absolutely not. Yeah, I-I-I-I'm with Michaela. No, Connor, think. The trophy, we need, yes, but the body stays where it is. No, the body is what gets us caught. You are not thinking straight. What do you suggest? Something that doesn't involve carrying a body across campus on the busiest night of the year! Connor : She's right, Laurel. Even if we get it out of the house unseen, the ground is frozen! We have all night to dig. You don't know what you're talking about! This is murder!  None  of us know what we're talking about! [ Knock on door ] [ Breathing shakily ] I know I can't be here, but I-I-I didn't know where else to go. I went to the police station. I wanted to tell them everything, but... The hell are you talking about? Everything's falling apart. Can you come outside? Nia's back in the hospital. [ Sighs ] You coming in or what? 
 
 Wes : Heads, we get the body. Tails, we leave it where it is. Okay? Heads. We go back for the body. Annalise : You were right. I think Sam killed Lila. Why are you saying that? [ Sniffles ] [ Voice breaking ] He lied... About everything. Lila was pregnant, and he knew. [ Sniffles ] He knew. You tell anyone? Just you. I told the D.A. to run a DNA test on all the men in her life, her teachers... That's good. You did the right thing. Did I? Annalise, come on. I mean, if they find out that he hurt her, that I did all those things to help him... illegal things... I mean, I should've listened to you. I should've... left him. Instead, I tried to protect him. He's your husband. He messed with your head. We would've  all  done the same thing. Not you. Michaela : Oh, please. A body doesn't just burn. You need an incinerator. But at least we'll get rid of our DNA. [ Sighs ] Connor : And the bonfire will cover the smoke. It's... it's kind of a perfect plan. Perfect? The bonfire. [ Crying ] There is nothing perfect about this plan. You guys... Cry all you want. I'm now on board with the plan. Listen to me! What?! What?! The bonfire...  That's  our alibi. [ Students cheering ] Connor : So, what's the plan here? Are we gonna chop him up into bbq-friendly pieces  now,  or are we gonna wait till he's broiled to a crisp? We'll roll him in the rug, deal with it in the woods. Good times. [ Cellphone buzzing ] Little help? Happy to. You are not about to call Aiden! No. You sure about that? If you call him, the cell tower will place you in this house. I know, okay? I'm not stupid. Look, I-I'm not gonna call him. Can I please just have my... This is scary. I know. And believe it or not, I know you... How much you like to be in control. But right now, you need to accept that this situation isn't one we can control. So we just need to switch off our brains and go along with the plan. Can you do that? Yeah. And don't talk to me like I'm a child. [ Phantogram's "Black out days" plays ] I should go. Where? I don't know. Uh, to a hotel. Don't worry. I won't go back  there. You're too upset to go anywhere. Stay until you calm down. No, Nate. Annalise, I'm telling you it's okay. It's okay. ♪ A thousand voices howling in my head ♪ [ Grunts ] [ Panting ] ♪ Speak in tongues ♪ fine. ♪ I don't even recognize your face ♪ [ Michaela grunts ] ♪ Mirror on the wall ♪ [ thud ] ♪ Tell me all the ways to stay away ♪ [ Both moaning ] So... You said you're in dental-equipment sales? [ Breathing heavily ] You smell so good. Mm. [ Gasps ] [ Cellphone rings ] Yo, yo, yo. [ Voice breaking ] It's Bonnie. Is your party still happening? Uh, it was kind of a bust, actually. Why? I don't know. I was... thinking I could swing by, maybe. [ Tires screech ] Wait... really? You want to come over? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. If that's okay with you. Uh, yeah. Totally. I'll... I'll be there in 20. Yes! ♪ You should save your eyes ♪ you've reached Sam Keating. Please leave a message. [ Beep ] No answer? No. It's probably better that way. Are we terrible people? I don't know. Depends on who you ask. ♪ Mirror on the wall ♪ Nate... This isn't... ♪ Tell me all the ways to stay away ♪

[ Chuckles ] No. Why don't you sit down? [ Chuckles ] [ Pats ] Uh... you're pretty wasted right now. I don't think we should... Really... you know... I'm a grown-ass woman. I might be drunk, but I know what I want when I want it. So get over here. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. It's fine. It's fine. One second. [ Zipper opens ] Oh! Just come here, you idiot! Take your pants off! All right. [ Both panting ] [ Indistinct conversations ] You've reached Sam Keating. Please leave a message. [ Beep ] Sam, it's me. I didn't think that you would pick up. [ Cellphone ringing ] What was that? Still, there's so much I need to say to you in person and not by phone, but I guess this will have to do. [ Sighs ] Why is Frank calling you? What? I saw your phone, Laurel. What the hell's going on? We've built a life together, Sam... 20 years. Wes : Okay. Last chance. Either we all agree or we stop right now. Just do it. Before the bonfire ends. Michaela? It's the only way to destroy the DNA. Annalise : Whatever we've said to each other, all the horrible things... I'll do whatever I can to make this right. I'll do anything. It's too late. We've seen each other through so much... Everything good and bad in our lives. Connor : Hey, guys. I think I just detached the tibia. Or... is that a fibula? [ Chuckles ] Annalise : So much pain. [ Connor grunts ] So much happiness. [ Laughs ] It's a rare thing to know someone that well and to bear witness to so much in someone's life. Here. So I'm asking you right now... no. Begging. Ah! Oh! Oh, m-m-m-m-my ring. What? M-my engagement ring is gone! Please forgive me for what I said. I didn't mean any of it, and I know you didn't, either. Are you sure you had the ring on when we left the house? I already told you... Yes! Annalise : I don't want things to end this way. [ Crying ] Oh, my God. What if we don't find it? I guess you'll just have to cancel the wedding. Wes : Stop! We still need her to return the trophy to Asher's. There is no way she can do that. Look at her. Oh, no. We all had to do things tonight that we didn't want to do. This one is on  her. I'll I want us to work through this. I want us to be together. I said wait! My ring might be in one of those! Enough about the ring, Frodo! Laurel : We are not going through every bag. I'm telling you, this is a bad idea. Annalise : Because whatever you did... You're not listening. Whatever the truth is... We need to get to an incinerator and find... I heard you! All night. I'm sorry, but you've been outvoted on this one. Aah! God! Oh, God! Oh, grow up! [ Grunts ] That's it. There's no more. Same time next week? Laurel : Can we please just go? Annalise : ...I will stay by your side through all of it, no matter what. Train's leaving, waitlist. You coming? Because I'm your wife. [ Engine turns over ] And I love you, and I need you. So please come home, Sam. Come home so we can be together. Come home. Rebecca? You in there? [ Door opens ] Morning. [ Sighs ] Where'd you go? Uh... Okay, well, let's see. I have a bagful of bagels and two coffees, so... Where's the thumb drive? It's right here. What are you doing? Why the hell did you do that?! Because we can't use it. Are you crazy? This is what proves that Sam killed Lila. It also proves we were at his house last night. So, what? This was all for nothing? Don't think about that. Connor : [ Voice breaking ] I screwed up, Oliver. I screwed up so bad. [ Gasping ] I screwed up. I scr... I screwed up. [ Sobs ] [ Sobbing ] I screwed up. I screwed up. I screwed up. It's gonna be okay. It isn't. No, it isn't. It isn't. It  will  be. [ Gasping ] Come inside... And tell me everything. [ Panting ] Laurel : I need your help. I stole it from Asher. I've been really stressed... About exams and us. I still haven't broken up with kan, and when I found out you had a girlfriend... Ex-girlfriend. Whatever. I stole it, and it was dumb. I just don't want people to think that I'm the shooting star, so I can't have it, and Asher can't know that I took it. That's the really bad thing you wanted to tell me? It's stupid. I know. I'll take care of it. Asher : Those fricking liars. First they steal my trophy, then they go party at the bonfire after making fun of me for wanting to go in the first place. You know you can't tell them about this. This never happened. You understand? Of course. I'd never be that guy. Do you think it could  not  happen one more time? [ Smooches ] [ Cellphone rings ] Hey. Annalise : [ Voice breaking ] Are you with him? What? Do not lie to me right now! I don't know who you're talking about. Sam! Are you with Sam? No. No. Why? What's wrong? Something terrible's happened. We fought last night after you left, and I told him that the D.A. was gonna find out that the baby was his. [ Crying ] I'm worried, Bonnie. He thinks he's gonna go away for murder and now he's not answering his phone, and I'm... What if he's done something stupid? Stay where you are. I will be right over. Please hurry. Of course. Who's that? I have to get to the office. Do you need a ride? We could get breakfast on our way. I don't think that's a good idea. Michaela : Mrs. Walker. You have got to be kidding. Please let me explain. You must take me for some new kind of fool. I'm  the fool, and I came here to tell you woman-to-woman that I am so sorry for my behavior last night. I am not that girl, but with final exams and Professor Keating relying so heavily on me and wanting to plan the perfect wedding, I-I just haven't been myself. I want to assure you that such an absurd reaction will never,  ever happen again. Which is why I want to give you this. Oliver : Feel better? Yeah. Good. 'Cause we need to talk. [ Sighs ] Right. [ Sniffles ] So... You said you'd tell me after you showered. What the hell happened last night? [ Sniffles ] I was high. What? I don't know what I took. I just... I was mixing a bunch of stuff... Uh, some pills and... this new stuff I'd never tried before. I thought you didn't do drugs. I lied. I have a drug problem, Oliver. [ Cellphone chimes ] Who's that? Bonnie. What does she want? She needs us back at the office. Are you serious? You're not going to work. You just told me you have a drug addiction. We need to talk about this. I know. And we will. But my boss needs me. I'll talk to you later. [ Door opens ] Michaela : She knows. We don't know anything. It could be about Rebecca's case. The rug's gone, genius. You think she didn't notice? She obviously had us all come over here so she could get us arrested and thrown into prison for the rest of our lives. Wes : You don't know that. Just calm down. [ Door opens, closes ] We'll be fine. Yeah. 'Cause we can trust  you about anything  right now. You guys are the worst liars. Enjoy the bonfire? Yeah, that's right. I saw your stupid pictures. We went last-minute. Well, thanks for the last-minute call. And you, Pratt. I believe you have something of mine? You talking about  this? Where'd you find that? It was on the porch when I got here. Point is, it's up for grabs now. No. It's mine, and I haven't studied at all, so... Then you better start. Bonnie : Good. Everyone's here now? It's Saturday. Why are we here? Something's happened that Annalise wants to talk to you all about. [ Knock on door ] [ Door opens ] That must be the police. Bonnie : I'll go get them. The police are gonna ask you a lot of questions about my husband. He was having an affair with Lila Stangard.. And I confronted him about it last night. We had a terrible fight. And now... [ Sniffles ] [ Crying ] Now he's not answering his phone. I-I think he might've fled. So... [ Sniffles ] Sorry to have to involve you all in this, but you're gonna be asked a lot of questions, especially since you worked on Rebecca's case, and I need you all to be as honest with the police as possible. Will you promise that you'll do that for me? Of course. [ Bell tolls ] Whatever you need. Man : Hey, asshat! Sometime this year, will ya? [ Bell tolls ] I'm so sorry. Annalise : Don't be. [ Bell tolls ] Thank you.
