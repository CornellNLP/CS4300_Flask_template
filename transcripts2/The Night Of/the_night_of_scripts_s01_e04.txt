 Alaikum salaam. 
 Check it out. My son's sick, so my wife couldn't make it to put money in my account.

 I'll settle up with you tomorrow, no doubt. 
 Female guard : Next. 
 Give me six beef jerkies, six honey buns, a bowl of moisturizer, a box of Q-tips, some Japanese noodle cups, say, six, and that jigsaw puzzle there. 
 Female guard : Next. 
 Nasir : Can I please get some, uh, instant lunch chicken noodles? 
 Man : You know you just got took. You know that, right? 
 Nasir : Yeah. 
 What the f*ck is wrong with you, man? 
 That's gonna happen every day now. 
 Everybody knows about that girl you raped and killed. 
 What you got to do now... 
 I didn't rape and kill anybody. 
 Did I ask you that? 
 What you got to do now is start walking like a man who's not afraid to look a man in the eye, only don't you ever look him in the eye 'cause you'll regret that. 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 So, look and don't look someone in the eye? How am I supposed to do that? 
 Like this. 
 Boom, boom... boom. 
 It's easy. You. 
 Boom. 
 Man : Okay. 
 And when you f*ck that up, and a man want to talk to you for motherfucking staring in their eye, you just be polite and respectful 'cause respect's all's anybody's got here. 
 But if they still want to f*ck with you, disrespect you, then you better stand your motherfucking ground, even if you got to get your ass beat. 
 'Cause you start backing down in here, you fair game and you done. You hear me? 
 Yeah. 
 Man : Good. 
 I'll make a proper convict of you yet. 
 I tell the barber, "This ain't the cut I asked for, and I ain't leaving the chair until I get it." 
 Mm-hmm. 
 He says, "You want a good cut?" 
 Next thing I know, he comes out with this machete.

 No doubt. But some parents have expressed concern, too, about his presence in the classroom.

 Why not? I paid good money for it. 
 Of course it isn't, not without a subpoena, so you should get one.

 Bailiff : The people vs. Nasir Khan, indictment number 4157 OF 2014. 
 Arraign the defendant. 
 The grand jury of the state of New York has indicted you for the crimes of possession of a weapon for deadly purpose, resisting arrest, aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, and murder in the first degree. How do you plead? 
 We've got a full dance card today, folks. 
 Not guilty. Not guilty. 
 There you go. 
 Your Honor, at this point, I am filing a copy of the indictment report and the victim disclosure statement report. 
 Alison : Your Honor, I wasn't here for the preliminary arraignment due to the fact that I wasn't yet retained, but I'm certainly here now. And it is my understanding that when my client was remanded at that first hearing, he was advised the issue of reasonable and affordable bail would be revisited, so that's what we're doing now. 
 Mr. Khan vigorously maintains his innocence and is intent on fighting these charges until he's exonerated. 
 He wants to go to trial, and so is not a flight risk. 
 If we instead would like to see a young man with no criminal record turned into a criminal, then let's have him sit at Rikers as long as the slow wheels of justice take. 
 Your Honor, it's a felony murder. He's facing life. 
 There's no bail high enough to guarantee he won't take off. 
 (chuckles) Where? Where is he gonna go? 
 To Pakistan, where he's never been? 
 To some al-Qaeda training camp? I mean, what is going on here? 
 There's nothing going on here. 
 Well, he doesn't even own a passport, so where is he going to go? 
 Your Honor, I don't know if it was media pressure or political pressure or just good old-fashioned 9/11 profiling, but I have never seen a grand jury dance so fast in my life, leaving me no time to properly prepare. 
 Prepare for what? This isn't his trial. 
 You'll have plenty of time to prepare. 
 And it's not as if he didn't have professional counsel before. 
 Excuse me? "Professional counsel"? He had John Stone. 
 (laughter) 
 Judge : Ms. Crowe... 
 Alison : Your Honor? 
 Not in my court. 
 I apologize. 
 Your client seems to have a little trouble looking at me. 
 Look at the judge. 
 That's better. 
 Mr. Khan, I see no reason to change your bail status. 
 You remain on remand, and we're done here. Next. 
 Bailiff : The people vs. Luke Waltman, indictment number 6244 of year 2014. 
 Johnny, that was uncalled for. 
 This is not a level playing field here. 
 The victim is an upper-class Caucasian, the accused a striving member of one of the most reviled ethnicities in America. 
 May I say something? 
 My client was consciously over-indicted by a D.A.'s office eager to score fast and score big, and we look forward to our day in court. Thank you.

 What I say to the press is for the public. 
 But with you, I have to be honest, and it is not good. 
 Running away with a knife from the scene of a brutal stabbing murder documented with photos that'll make a jury's heart stop... 
 But I didn't do it. We are way past, "I didn't do it," Naz. 
 Here's what time it is. If you are convicted, which you likely will be, you will spend the rest of your life in a cage, waking up every morning wishing you were dead, unless... 
 Unless? 
 Unless I can somehow convince the D.A.'s office, and it is a long shot, to accept a plea of manslaughter with a max sentence of, say, 15 years. 
 But I'm not gonna fight for you on this unless you can say, "Yes, I accept that. 
 It's better than the alternative." 
 And, Nasir, believe me, it is. 
 Can I think about it? 
 Of course. 
 But when we go before the judge, it has to be "yes" or nothing at all.

 Well, why would they accept it if it's good for me? 
 Trials cost a lot of money. 
 If they can reasonably avoid it, they will. 
 It happens every day. 
 Thank you. 
 For? 
 For just talking to me like I'm a person. 
 What would you do? 
 She told me to come in here and talk some sense into you, but if I were you, I would ask myself one question: Did I kill her? 
 If the answer is "yes," take the deal. 
 If it's "no"... don't. 
 Hey, unless you f*ck it up in there, 15 years is 12 years. 
 12 years, you still have a chance of walking out a human being. 
 Any more than that, no. 
 You'll be 35 when you get out, and you'll still have a life. 
 Take the deal. 
 It says that I killed her. 
 No, it doesn't. 
 It says you don't trust 12 idiots on a jury to get it right, and neither do I. 
 You want to play roulette? Go to Atlantic City where the odds are better. 
 My parents will never know I didn't do it for sure. 
 They don't know that now. 
 Naz, I'd kill to be 35 again. 
 Take the deal. 
 Bailiff : All rise. 
 All right. 
 I understand that in an exchange for a plea of guilty, the people are offering to downgrade the charge of murder one to manslaughter one with a sentence of 15 years. 
 Is that your understanding of the agreement, Ms. Crowe? 
 It is, Your Honor. Mr. Khan, is that your understanding? 
 Yes. 
 All right. 
 You're gonna be asked a series of questions by the district attorney. 
 If at any time you don't understand what's being asked of you or you have any need for clarification, feel free to interrupt and ask any question, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Bailiff : Defendant, please rise. 
 Raise your right hand. 
 Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? 
 I do. 
 Have you spoken with your lawyer before making this application? 
 Yes. 
 Have you taken any drugs or alcohol or anything else that would affect your ability to understand these proceedings today? 
 No. 
 Do you understand that pleading guilty is the same as going to trial and being convicted of manslaughter in the first degree? 
 Yes. You understand that by pleading guilty today, you are giving up your right to cross-examination or to call witnesses to testify on your behalf in front of a jury? 
 Yes. Do you understand that by pleading guilty, you give up your right to appeal to a higher court? Yes. 
 Are you pleading guilty because you are, in fact, guilty? 
 Yes. 
 In your own words, then, tell us what happened on the night of October 24th. 
 I left my parents' house in my father's taxi to go to a party in Manhattan. 
 I got lost. 
 And Andrea got into the back of the cab, thinking I was a real cab driver. 
 We drove uptown. We talked. 
 She gave me something, some... some pill. 
 We went back to her place, and we drank. 
 She gave me something else, some powder. 
 We, uh... we went up to her bedroom. 
 We had s*x. 
 And then? 
 And then... 
 (soft panting) 
 Then I fell asleep and woke up in the kitchen. 
 I went back up to the bedroom to get my clothes and say goodbye. 
 Then I went to her... and I saw that she was dead. 
 I... I panicked. I ran. 
 And? 
 And, uh... 
 (floorboards creaking) 
 That's all I remember. 
 (whispering) Are you kidding me? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Ask him again. 
 You drank, took drugs, had s*x, and... killed her. 
 No. No, I didn't. 
 Then what the hell are you pleading guilty to? 
 Okay. What else we got here today? 
 Alison : You are an idiot. You have f*cked yourself. 
 Right now, out there, that prosecutor, that sweet lady, is sharpening her knife, and the judge is gonna help her murder you for making them go to trial. 
 And, frankly, I feel like killing you myself. 
 So quit. 
 What? 
 What did you say? 
 Quit. 
 I should. 
 In fact, I do. I quit. 
 Gate. 
 Alison : My firm will continue to work for your son's exoneration, but two things will change. 
 Nasir's primary attorney will now be Ms. Kapoor, and given that we're now facing what will be a complex trial, I can no longer offer you our services pro bono. 
 Of course, you're free to decline and seek counsel elsewhere. 
 (rock music playing) 
 (line ringing) 
 Man on phone : Westside Animal. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm, uh, calling about a cat. 
 It's an ugly sort of orange thing. 
 Man : Are you the guy with the feet? 
 Right. The guy with the feet. 
 That's me. 
 Yeah. I'll hold. 
 (dogs barking) 
 Man : It's still here. 
 It's still there? 
 Man : You want him? 
 No, I don't want it. 
 I'm just, you know, checking. 
 Man : Okay. 
 Okay? Thanks. 
 Man : You stuck to your guns. 
 That's good. 
 That's rare. 
 Maybe you'll get lucky, and the judge will screw up with you, too. 
 Well, I didn't take the plea 'cause I didn't do it. 
 Yeah. 
 That's what he said, too, my niece's killer. 
 You didn't do it. He didn't do it. 
 I guess don't nobody do sh1t, huh? 
 This joint is so chock-a-block with "I didn't do it" M*therf*ckers, they falling from the rafters. 
 Charlene. 
 What? 
 My niece. 
 Her name was Charlene. 
 And this... this is for her. 
 (gasping) f*ck! f*ck! 
 (groaning) 
 (inhales sharply) 
 Who was it? 
 I don't know. It was dark. 
 I asked you a question. 
 I answered it. 
 (chuckles) 
 (inaudible) 
 (keys jingling) 
 Say the words for me, Nasir. 
 I need your help.
