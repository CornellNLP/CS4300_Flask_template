 Let's go, in the back. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 There's no car for him to come get the car.

 Hey, cuffs? 
 No, I don't think so. 
 He needs it for work, and there's no way... 
 Yeah, I know. You call him, when you get to the precinct, you tell him where it is, and he'll come and get it. Let's go.

 What street is this? 
 You the gentleman that called? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, so what's going on? 
 So, I hear something, you know? 
 A glass breaking. 
 And then from my window, I see an open door. 
 I see this man go through the door, and then he comes back out a few seconds later. 
 Then I see him running down the street and get into a cab. 
 Race? 
 Could have been light-skinned black, uh, Latino, I really don't know. 
 Not Caucasian, though? 
 Could have been, sure, why not?

 Clothes? 
 He wore clothes. 
 I'm sorry. Uh, dark, maybe. 
 Okay, maybe, and he took a cab. 
 Yeah, a cab.

 Officer : What do you got? 
 Cass : We got a break-in. 
 One eyewit, this gentleman here. 
 Sees male, undetermined race, goes in, comes out, runs down the street, gets into a cab. 
 Anyone inside? 
 Waiting on you. 
 Who's that in the car? 
 Cass : No one. He was with us when we got the call. 
 He's not drunk, I can see that. He's just driving like a f*cking idiot.

 Sorry, boss. 
 Get the door before 10 more people trample through. 
 Who made the call? 
 Neighbor over there. 
 Anybody else see anything? 
 Apparently not. 
 Cameras? 
 There's one up the street. We're not sure if it's working. 
 Pulling the film. 
 Who's that? 
 He's ours. 
 Reckless driving. 
 You picked him up and brought him here? What the f*ck for? 
 Well, we just pulled him over when the call comes in... 
 Well, I don't want him here. 
 Get a unit. Take him back to the house or cut him loose. 
 Uh, we'll take him, sir. We're off-duty... 
 Not you. You stay. 
 Let's get the neighbor back to the house, too. 
 He's famous enough out here already. 
 No smoking on my crime scene. 
 Go ahead, sir. 
 All right, let's go. 
 Where? 
 Just get out of the car. 
 
 
 
 Box wants you to take him to the station. 
 Nice-looking kid. 
 Yeah. 
 What'd he do? 
 Who? 
 Him. 
 I don't know, he's a witness, isn't he? 
 Hey, what'd you see? 
 I didn't see nothing.

 I mean, it's quiet.

 Up. Up. 
 f*ck you lookin' at? 
 What can you tell me about the weapon, Harry? 
 Pretty sure it's one knife. 
 Approximately one and a half inch wide by, I'm gonna say, five inches long. 
 Till I get her on the table and probe. 
 Box : Serrated, or no? 
 Not sure yet. Possibly. 
 What happened? 
 What, you can't tell me nothing? 
 Or you don't know nothing? 
 Ain't that... That's where that girl lives, right? 
 I mean, what happened? What'd he do? What, he kill her or something? 
 I'm just playing, I'm just playing. 
 But for real, what happened? 
 You can't give out any information? 
 Have a seat, sir. 
 Someone will be right with you, all right? 
 Hi, Sergeant. 
 Hey, who's this? 
 One wit. 
 Sergeant told me to bring him in. 
 Klein : All right, looks good. Any problems? 
 Officer : Nope. 
 Dad. 
 You all right? 
 Where's Naz? 
 What? 
 So, who's "he" in the sentence "he kill her or something"? 
 Uh, look, man, I was just saying. 
 You were just saying what? 
 I mean, you know, some Arab dude she was with. 
 Describe him. 
 You know, an Arab dude. 
 No, I don't. 
 Look like he work at a deli or some sh1t. 
 Try harder. 
 Uh, like, little, short, skinny, Puerto Rican-looking m*therf*cker with beanie eyes. 
 How do you know he wasn't Puerto Rican? Was he wearing anything Arabic? 
 Nah, man, he... 
 He had on his regular, you know, Friday night, go out and party sh1t. 
 I mean, I tried to warn her, too. 
 Yeah? How'd you go about doing that? 
 I just told him right to his face. 
 But you didn't know him. 
 Nope. 
 Never saw him before. 
 Nope, nope. 
 You know the girl? 
 I mean, not  per se,  you know what I'm saying? 
 No, I don't. 
 I mean, I know her type. 
 What type is that? 
 You know what, this coming out wrong. 
 What's your name? 
 How about you give me your card or something, and then I just bang you on this later? 
 My card. 
 If I turn you upside down, how much weed is gonna fall out? 
 Oh, so that's how you do? 
 See? 
 No good deed goes unturned. 
 Take him in. 
 Let's go.

 No, but he said you were going out together tonight. 
 Yeah, we were supposed to go to a party, but I didn't go. 
 So, where was this party? 
 (speaking Urdu) 
 Amir : I have no idea. I don't have the address on me. 
 Box : I don't know what you're doing here. 
 I have witnesses to interview, do you? 
 Go back out there. 
 Sarge, we got 10,000 gold shields on the scene. 
 What do you need us out there for? 
 It's called chain of custody. 
 Didn't you go to the academy like the other kids? 
 And when you log it all, remember, blood stays with blood, hair with hair, photos with photos.

 Who'd we tell to test? 
 We told what's-his-name. 
 Klein : What's-his-name. 
 What's the matter, you guys don't like overtime? 
 Who doesn't like overtime? 
 You want, I'll test him right now. 
 Now you're gonna test him. 
 Test what? It's gone, if it was ever there. 
 Just dodged a bullet here, kid. 
 Get his pedigree, search him, clear him of warrants, and kick him free. 
 Put your hands on the railing for me. 
 Box : Be careful with the inventory vouchers. 
 Klein : DCPI called, I'm like, totally in the dark here. 
 Can you help me out? 
 I'll do my best, Teddy. 
 Uh, name? 
 Nasir Khan. 
 Victim's name is Andrea Cornish. 
 Spell it. 
 22 years old. 
 N-a-s-i-r. 
 K-h-a-n. 
 Caucasian. 
 Found in a bedroom, in bed. 
 DOB? 
 Stabbing homicide. 
 Um, 11/12/90. 
 Suspect is a male. 
 Unknown age, unknown race. 
 This your current address? 
 Yeah. 
 Seen leaving at approximately 0200 running down the block hailing a taxi. 
 Witness : I didn't say that he hailed a taxi. 
 I said that he left in a taxi. 
 That's what I said. 
 His taxi. 
 Fine. 
 Is this what we do? Dump our witnesses here? 
 Somebody escort the gentleman to the squad room. 
 Uh, Frank, do you mind? 
 Frank : Come with me, sir. 
 Race, what are you? 
 Uh, Pakistani. 
 Asian Pacific or other. 
 Who's the other guy? 
 What other guy? 
 I was talking to who I said bring in. 
 The one reeking weed. 
 Maldonado : Who'd we tell? 
 Cass : Bell. 
 Nope. Brought him in. 
 Klein : How many times stabbed? 
 Box : I didn't count, Teddy. 
 A lot. 
 Maldonado : Occupation? 
 Student. 
 Get it from Harry. 
 Where? 
 Please put your hands behind your head for me, please, lock your fingers. 
 Where? 
 Hudson College. 
 Turn around. 
 Klein : Weapon recovered? 
 Box : Not as yet. 
 ESU's doing a toss of the house, street, dumpsters, grates, drains. 
 What we're looking for is an approximately five-inch-long, one-and-a-half-inch-wide, possibly serrated... knife. 
 Maldonado : Turn around. 
 Do not move. 
 You picked him up where, again? 
 65th and Broadway. 
 No, wait, wait. 
 What time? 
 About 0200. 
 I didn't do it. 
 Didn't do what? 
 What's your name, son? 
 Nasir. You don't understand. 
 That's why we're gonna talk, okay? 
 So I will understand. 
 Just you and me. 
 Come over here. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Please, let go of me. 
 No, no! 
 I didn't do anything! 
 I didn't do anything! 
 Put your hands behind your back! 
 Give me your arm! 
 (shouting) 
 Hey, hey, man, that's the dude I was talking about. That's him, right there. 
 Yeah. Hey, that's him. 
 Aah! 
 No! 
 (phone buzzing) 
 Naz : Argh! No! No! 
 I didn't do anything! 
 Should we call the police? 
 No. 
 Bell : Remember what he said in the car? 
 "Is she dead?" 
 (door opens) 
 We didn't, uh, formally meet out there. 
 I'm Detective Sergeant Dennis Box. 
 So, Nasir. 
 Is that what you like to be called, or? 
 Naz. 
 Naz. Okay. That's easy. 
 So, Naz, what happened tonight? 
 Did you know Andrea well, or just meet her? 
 Just someone who got in your cab? 
 My dad's cab. 
 Your dad's cab, all right. 
 You picked her up in the cab. 
 Where? 
 Naz... 
 I don't know. Downtown somewhere. 
 I was lost. I don't know. 
 Okay. Then? 
 Where did she say she wanted to go? 
 The beach. 
 The what? 
 The beach. 
 The beach? 
 She say something, or... do something or behave in some way to upset you? 
 No. 
 She must have said something. 
 No. 
 Naz, you said out there I didn't understand. 
 And you're right, I don't. 
 That's what I'm trying to do here. I'm... 
 It's why I'm here. 
 To try to understand. To hear it from you. 
 I don't have to do that, by the way. 
 I want to. 
 What you need to understand is what you say to me here is very important. 
 For you, not me. 
 It can help you. 
 I'm trying to help you. Help me help you. 
 (gasping) 
 I can't breathe. 
 Okay. 
 That's okay, not uncommon. Just relax. 
 No, I mean, I have asthma. 
 Oh. You got something to help you with that? 
 No. 
 You wanna go to the hospital? 
 I wanna go home. 
 You still on hold? 
 Yes, I am. 
 Where is this hospital? 
 It's here, where do you think? 
 Didn't he say he was going into Manhattan? 
 "Is she dead?" 
 What? 
 That's what you asked the officers in the car that brought you here. 
 "Is she dead?" 
 You don't remember saying that? 
 They hadn't said anything about her. Hadn't... said it was a she or a he, let alone dead, nobody had. 
 So, you were at her place. Can we agree on that? 
 You have a couple drinks. 
 Maybe a kiss. 
 You have a couple more drinks and... 
 And she's pretty, I know that. I saw her. 
 What'd she do, say no? 
 No. 
 Fought you? 
 No. 
 Then what happened, Naz? 
 I don't know. I fell asleep. 
 When I woke up, and she was like that... 
 She was dead. 
 And you, what did you do? 
 I ran. 
 'Cause I was scared. 
 By what you'd done. 
 No. 
 What we're gonna do when we're done here, just so you know, is run some tests. 
 You know why? 
 Because you're a crime scene, Nasir. 
 Just like the house, and the cab, and Andrea. 
 And it's our job to collect everything we can from a crime scene. 
 And here's what we're gonna find, if you ask me. 
 Her in the cab, the cab on her, you in the house, the house on you, you on her, her on you, the knife on you, her on the knife. 
 I didn't kill her. 
 You had s*x with her. 
 Yes. But it wasn't... 
 I didn't force her. 
 I didn't say you did. 
 She's only the second girl I've ever slept with in my life. 
 I liked her. 
 She was nice. 
 Look, I'm gonna be straight with you, Naz. 
 Because what I'm looking at, the evidence already, the eyewitnesses are so strong... you really need to start telling me the truth for your sake. 
 I am. 
 You see that, right? 
 That's recording us. 
 And it will be used in court. 
 How you think that's gonna come off? 
 "She was nice, I liked her. 
 But I killed her anyway." 
 I didn't. I already told you, I... 
 I can't remember. 
 I have to tell you, that's not gonna play any better. 
 Judges and juries... they don't like "I can't remember." 
 They like honesty. They like remorse. 
 They like that a lot. 
 That counts for something to them. 
 And even more to you. 
 I'm talking about years. 
 Honesty and remorse can shave a lot of years off. 
 So, you may want to revise that. 
 Now's the time. 
 All right. 
 Let's go do what we have to do. 
 We can talk again later. 
 Come on. 
 Take your clothes off. 
 What's... 
 Shut the f*ck up and take your shirt off. 
 Don't look at me. Take your pants off. 
 Sorry about that. 
 Here. Put these on. 
 Thank you. 
 Hello? 
 How long do I have to be in here? I got things to do. 
 No, that's okay. 
 Would you hang on a second, please? 
 Gentlemen, how's the scene? 
 It's the Battle of Gettysburg. 
 We'll be there all day. Where's the birthday boy? 
 Upstairs. 
 Thanks. 
 Klein : Can you spell your name for me? 
 Hey, yo, excuse me, miss? 
 Hey, yo, can I call my moms? 
 Go, go, come on. 
 All right, I'll have one of our detectives get in touch with you. 
 Man : Turn to your left. 
 Turn to the other side. 
 Take your shirt off. 
 Officer : Make sure you get some close-ups on those back scratches. 
 Get a shot of that. 
 Put your arms up. 
 All right, put your hand here. 
 Turn it over. 
 Let's get a close-up. Thank you. 
 Box : I'd like to get a little swab of the blood on your hands. 
 A little swipe under the nails. 
 A little bit off the scratches on your back. 
 And inside your cheek. Okay if I do that? 
 I don't know. Is it? 
 I need your consent, Naz. 
 If you don't give it, then I have to get a court order. 
 And that will take about 45 minutes. 
 So, it's not a problem. 
 Except for you. 
 Refusing looks bad to a jury. 
 And I really don't want you disadvantaged. 
 But it's up to you. 
 You can say no. 
 I didn't do it. 
 Well, there you have it. 
 You got nothing to fear, so, shall we go ahead and do it then? 
 Your call. 
 Say the words for me, Naz. 
 Yes. 
 Open your mouth. 
 Oh, one more thing. 
 I'm gonna need a penile swab, too. 
 Is it okay if we do that next? 
 Yes? 
 Okay. 
 You want me to stay? 
 Will it hurt? 
 No. 
 Stand up. 
 Drop your pants. 
 That's good, good. 
 Just... just relax. 
 CSU : I think we're about done here? 
 CSU 2 : Box wanted palms and tips, too. 
 I didn't hear him say that. 
 Then don't do it. 
 All right, try not to shake too much. 
 I want a lawyer. 
 CSU 2 : Oh, yeah, why? 
 What do you mean, why? 
 You know what kind of message that sends? 
 Hey, what do we know. We're just crime scene unit guys. 
 So, why don't you wait till the squad detectives come back, and get into all that with them. 
 Seriously though, kid, look before you leap, is what I say. 
 Okay. We're done here. 
 Wipe up. 
 Man : Here's my card. 
 250 bucks. I'll meet you there. 
 You'll be okay. 
 Will you take a check? 
 For you, Paul? 
 Pauline. 
 Pauline, I'm sorry. 
 A cashier's check's okay. 
 Hey, what's with Gunga Din in there? 
 Who? 
 The big-eyed kid. 
 The kid? 
 Yeah, in the pen. 
 Oh, him. 
 He cut a girl on 87th Street. 
 Who did? 
 They're called razors, Jack, you should invest. Experiment. 
 Worse comes to worst, it all grows back. 
 All right, my man. 
 All we need now is the knife and clothes and shoes. 
 I sent all that over before you got here. 
 Who did? 
 Two of my unis drove it over. 
 You always break chain of evidence like that? 
 Relax. It's all there, neat and tidy. 
 Here's a voucher. 
 They handed it to Mathis? 
 He's their dispatcher? 
 Apparently with the Battle of Gettysburg and all, he was the only one there. 
 Hey, nobody told me you were coming here. 
 Yet here we are. 
 Klein : Thought I was doing you guys a favor. The f*ck do I know? 
 Next time, wait for us. 
 Next time, call first. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm here to see my client. 
 You just did. 
 Not him... her. 
 Him. 
 Your man is here, as it were, Johnny the Red. 
 Bye now. 
 Jack : And don't lose that key! 
 25 years, the Berlin Wall comes down, and this throwback's still going on about communists. 
 So, Nazir... Nasir. 
 Is that what I call you or... 
 Naz. 
 You're a citizen, Naz? 
 What... who are you? 
 Your lawyer. You a U.S. citizen? 
 You're like, a public defender? 
 No. 
 You're a citizen? 
 Yeah. 
 Guess number one: Pakistani by blood? 
 Yeah, my mom. 
 What is she? 
 Punjabi, Pashtun, Baluch? 
 Punjabi. 
 You been to Pakistan? 
 No. 
 Have you? 
 No. 
 It's eczema. 
 Dermatologist says to keep them aerated. 
 Like that's gonna cure anything. 
 I don't know, maybe it helps. I really can't tell. 
 You ever been arrested? 
 No. 
 Pissing in public, littering, anything? 
 No. 
 Well, first time for everything, right? 
 Don't worry about my feet. 
 It's not contagious. 
 How's your politics? 
 What do you mean, my politics? 
 Well, not to sound like a tea-bagger, but how do you feel about America? 
 Well, I'm American. I was born here. 
 Name two Yankees headed for the Hall of Fame? 
 Why? 
 One Mississippi... 
 Rivera and Jeter. 
 Good. 
 Married? 
 No. 
 So, as a good Muslim boy, you live with your parents? 
 Yeah. 
 Talk to them yet? 
 They took my phone. 
 Talk to anyone? 
 N... What do you mean? 
 Here. 
 Like, who? 
 It's not a tough question. Like cops, who else is there? 
 Uh, I talked to one. 
 Why? 
 What do you mean, why? 
 Tell me he told you you had to? 
 He didn't. 
 Tell me he didn't read you your rights? 
 They did. 
 I may need you to come down again. 
 So, don't like, run off to Europe without telling me. 
 Do I look like someone running off to Europe anytime soon? 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 You may go home and get some sleep now. 
 Almost done? 
 Yeah. You? 
 Yeah. 
 Let's get out of here before they... 
 (door opens) 
 Don't look up. 
 Hit print, let's go. 
 You two were first on the scene, right? 
 Yeah. Just finished the DD-5s. 
 Everything's done. We're going home. 
 Upstairs. 
 Sir, we were supposed to be off like five hours ago. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 So... 
 So come upstairs. 
 This was when? 
 I don't know, what time is it now, 4:00? 
 6:00. 
 6:00! What time am I getting out of here? 
 Never, if you keep answering questions with questions. 
 What was the question again? 
 What time it was when you saw them, as you put it, rubbing up against each other? 
 (watch ticking) 
 I wanna say... 
 10:00, 11:00, something like that. 
 You were alone? 
 Yeah. 
 Doing what? 
 Just walking. 
 On West 87th Street a block from the park? 
 The f*ck is that supposed to mean? 
 Is this her? 
 Yeah, that's her. 
 Is he on this? 
 I just told you that was him out there on the floor, like, hours ago. What more do you want from me? 
 I want you to look at it, and tell me if he's on it or not. 
 This towelhead right here. 
 Just the number, not the op-ed. 
 Four. Number four. 
 Initial it for me. 
 Thank you, Trevor. 
 Okay, Naz, listen to me, don't talk to anybody anymore. 
 Anyone asks you anything, how you doing, isn't it a nice day? 
 You say, "Gee, I don't know. 
 Talk to my lawyer." Okay? Say it. 
 Okay. 
 No, no, say that to me. 
 I don't know... 
 I don't know. 
 Talk to... 
 Talk to my lawyer. 
 Good. I've been an "I don't know" guy all my life. 
 It's never let me down. 
 Where are you going? 
 To see if I can get you out of here. Short of that, get your phone call. 
 You know what they're saying I did? 
 I don't. And I don't care. 
 Until they charge you, you didn't do anything. 
 Guard! 
 Don't go anywhere. 
 Thanks, Wayne. 
 You know what I wonder? 
 Where'd it all go wrong? 
 The cop who first built one of these counters, how tall you think he was? 
 I want to take the kid out of here. 
 No sh1t. 
 Is he being charged? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 With? 
 Possession of a weapon, for now. 
 Misdemeanor desk appearance. Let's get him to a judge. 
 Not gonna happen. They like him for this 87th Street thing big time. 
 Who's they? 
 Box. 
 The f*ck's he got to do with it? 
 What do you think? 
 Lieberman said he cut a girl. 
 "Cut" is right. 
 She's dead? 
 Uh-huh. 
 And it's Box? 
 Uh-huh. 
 f*ck. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Naz? 
 Listen, I'm at a police station. 
 And it... it's all a mistake. 
 They've arrested me. They think I did something. 
 Murder. 
 Is he hurt?
