 There are some battles you fight, because you have no choice. 
 There are battles you fight, because there is too much at stake not to fight. 
 Then there are battles you fight, because it is time to build a castle. 
 Something worth defending. 
 I honestly don't know what to do here, please enlighten me. 
 You don't need to do anything Dad. 
 I need to talk to you in the flesh, I..I'm going come over. 
 Please don't, I need time ok. Time alone, time away. 
 You can't just run away like this Shay. 
 Or as I call it... coming home. 
 I hate this I want to sit down in a natural room and talk to you properly. 
 Please don't come over. 
 Stay there, take care of Arlo. 
 Or let him look after you. 
 Dad I love you. 
 It probably doesn't seem like it right now but... please... I have to go now, bye. 
 Shay. 
 Give her time to clear her head, it'll be alright. 
 So that's it I just do nothing? 
 Time George, time heals. 
 (LAPTOP VIDEO CALL RINGING) 
 It's for you. 
 Well I'm not here. 
 George how's it going buddy? 
 Way past due for us to have some facetime a? 
 Hey nice hair. 
 Thanks... how are things Noah? 
 First I just want to reiterate how much the new editorial team loved your last column. 
 Ah there's an editorial team now hey? 
 Since Jan went all Elvis on it and left the building the guys up stairs have taken a more hands on approach probably not before time between you and me. 
 Just let me say one more time how everyone loves the new direct George. 
 Do you copy me on that George? 
 I copy. Straight form the mouth, not the brain that's what we like. 
 Anyway got to go but keep up the good work if you catch my drift? 
 (TAPS ON KEYBOARD) 
 Parasite. 
 Katie : Ok Ross, the council meeting is tomorrow. I've got a petition for you, it's important we get as many signatures as possible. 
 Hey you... 
 Yeah you. 
 Don't run, she'll only hunt you down. 
 Hey Katie. 
 Hey. 
 Idiot! 
 Oh my turn. 
 No no no. 
 What were you thinking? 
 What, when? 
 Driving that girl to the airport and the rest. 
 Well that's what she wanted. 
 And if I wanted to jump off a bridge, you'd help me too? 
 Right now, yeah. 
 Woah yeah, so so George is really angry at me? 
 Yeah well, probably. 
 Right now I think he's more concerned about his daughter than you. 
 And he's got that aussie chick to sort out. 
 Aussie chick? 
 What aussie chick? 
 Um Jan, Jan this is Woody, Woody Jan. 
 Oh the famous Woody, hello. 
 The famous Jan, hey welcome to Weld. 
 Thank you. 
 Awww Jan. 
 Not a good day for work Woody. 
 Yeah well I'm not here for work mate. 
 Katie told me about Shay. 
 Mate if there is anything I can do. 
 No offense Woody, but you smell bloody awful. 
 Yeah that be the bogs, been down the camp ground all night working on em. 
 I though to myself Woody get up here, see how he is. 
 I've been better. 
 Yeah I bet you have. 
 Hey, you fancy a surf? 
 Nah. 
 Yeah nah, well it's ideal. 
 For you. For me? 
 Well for your skill level. 
 You know it's not to big, it's glassy, they're rolling in nicely. 
 It's good for the soul. 
 Thank you Woody, but no. 
 Nah no worries... the ocean will always be there right. 
 While I'm here you mind if I grab a shower? 
 Yeah I think you should. 
 Cheers you're a champion mate. 
 Isn't he a champion? 
 Yep. 
 (IPAD RINGING) 
 Man, aren't you a total attention seeker? 
 Nice talking to you too. 
 How's Dad? 
 What, you mean in the 10 minutes since you talked to him? 
 Yeah he's good, moved on, we've forgotten all about you. 
 We adopted an orphan. 
 Good to hear. 
 And in other news, I'm taking your room. 
 Have it... im not coming back Arlo, I can't live in that town. 
 Not with everyone looking at me, knowing everything about me. 
 Here I can disappear. 
 Well if it helps, I can completely ignore you when you come back? 
 Nice offer, but like I said, I'm not going back. 
 Well, what if you came over here? 
 If you tell Dad you want to come over, he'll totally cave and then we can start a proper life again. 
 Do it Arlo. 
 I have to go. 
 So, are we going to the camp ground? 
 Nah you go, I'm staying here. 
 So you can book a flight? 
 Because I don't feel like being round people right now. 
 Because our family is in ruins and I don't actually give a toss about a bloody camp ground. 
 And I've got a column to write. 
 And you have a son. 
 Who would quite like to check out what's happening in the town where he now lives. 
 Just reminding you. 
 Sign the petition Tom? 
 Ha very funny. 
 Hi. 
 This isn't going to turn into one of them occupy things is it? 
 It's a camp ground Tom, people are here to camp. 
 However long it takes for Big Mac to show off his unholy plans. 
 I'm kidding Tom, it's a bit of fun for the weekend. 
 Make our point, then we go home. 
 I see you brought your tent. 
 The offical police recruiting tent. 
 Oh... good luck with that. 
 So everyone here hates old people? 
 No,no ah, I think people just like the way Weld is. 
 Stuck in the 80's. 
 Careful, some of us love the 80's. 
 George, you coming? 
 For a bit. Not long, I've got a column to write. 
 Of course. 
 We'll show you Weld while we're out. 
 Just trust me, it won't take too long. 
 So when they ask you how you like New Zealand so far? 
 Just tell them, it's beautiful. 
 They seem to like that. 
 But it is beautiful. 
 That's the story. 
 How's Shay? 
 Look, did she make it ok? 
 Hey, what did you just do to my boy? 
 No no no Dad it's ok I..I..it was my fault, I deserved it. 
 George, no one punches anyone at my protest. 
 I thought you said it wasn't a protest Katie? 
 Not now Tom. 
 Righto. 
 You two inside, come on. 
 Zac : You need me? 
 Katie : No you're on Hangi, duty I've got this. 
 Come on. 
 Ike : There was no way I could say no when she asked me to take her to the airport. 
 Yes there is, it's called saying no. 
 The alternative was, she was going hitchhike. 
 The alternative was you tell me and I stop her from going. 
 How? By locking her up? 
 Shay was getting out of here one way or the other. 
 I'm sorry, but you need to face the fact that she didn't fit here. 
 And I bet you were happy to provide a shoulder for her to cry on? 
 I don't think crying on anyones shoulder really Shay's style. 
 And all I could say from my point of view is, I really like her. 
 And I'm just as sad as you that she's gone. 
 Oh, I bet you're not? 
 But at least I respect her for making the right decision. 
 What, you think it's the right decision for her to run away? 
 She's almost like 18 right? What were you doing when you were 18 Mr Turner? 
 Hey, I'm sorry about the way things happened. 
 But I'm really not sorry that it did happen. 
 Your sister fled to Australia then? 
 Do you mean that in the long arm of the law sense? 
 Oh yeah, hadn't thought of that. 
 Hey. 
 So, you're the aussie chick right? 
 I suppose I am. 
 Jan. 
 Zac. 
 That was my boy George just punched. 
 Oh. 
 So, how do you like New Zealand so far? 
 It's very beautiful. 
 Strictly speaking, I should be charging you with assault. 
 No it's cool, I don't want to lay charges. 
 This isn't America, I'm the only one who here who chooses when and if charges get laid. 
 Ok, and I choose to not lay charges. 
 Because you deserved a smack for being a dick. 
 I'm sorry about your girl. 
 Deal to the legal ramifications, when we get to that bridge. 
 Sorry what? 
 Court dates and so forth. 
 Anyway, I'd be embarrassed charging a man after a punch like that. 
 Worst punch ever. 
 You go, and you instead of punching people make yourself useful. 
 I've got to go, I've got a column to write. 
 No, you'll just go and sit there feeling sorry for yourself. I know what men are like. 
 I need you to go and get Fiona. 
 She's refushing to come, and she should see this. 
 What happened to you? 
 Siouxsie painted my face. 
 Aren't you to old for that? 
 Go b..bring the ice queen. 
 Katie : Siouxsie. 
 Hola Arlo, I am El Diablo. 
 But this place is amazing, people must use it? 
 Oh, for a month over christmas when the outsiders invade, it's packed as. 
 The other 11 months of the year it costs the council heaps. 
 You sort it out with my boy? 
 Yes sort of. 
 Close enough. 
 I have to go do..do a thing. 
 Pick up Fiona. 
 You not running away are you? 
 No such luck. You OK here? 
 All good George, sweet as. 
 I am sweet as. 
 But you better come back. 
 Sure. 
 So who's this Fiona person? 
 Ah, the vote my loverly ex wife is after. 
 There are 5 people on the council sub committee. 
 Katie has two no's in her back pocket. 
 Serena and Doug. 
 The other two are relatives of Big Mac. 
 The property developer. 
 So Fiona is the swing vote? 
 No she's voting for Big Mac, which is weird because she hates Big Mac. 
 So if she hates the guy why does she vote for him? 
 Apparently it's a big picture thing. 
 What ever that is? 
 Dad are you going home? 
 No, I'll come back. 
 Man, your Dad is like a broken man. 
 You're leaving already? 
 Ah yeah, I've been give sacred task by camp mother. 
 Katie? 
 Yeah. 
 Are the kids here? 
 Yes and...and no um Shay is in Sydney. 
 I'll let the school know on Monday. 
 But ah...I better get on and do this thing for Katie. 
 Hello? 
 Oh...table for one? 
 Ah no, I'm on a take away mission. 
 Taking you. 
 Ah, to the bloody thing? 
 Yeah I was told to, by Katie. 
 Yeah I bet you were. 
 How are you? 
 Yeah I'm OK. 
 How's Shay? 
 She's in Sydney. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Yep the pretty much covers it. 
 What happened to your hand? 
 I kind of hit Ike. 
 Ohhh not wise. 
 Yeah, I'm not proud of it. 
 No I mean, that kid's got a head of iron. 
 Good to know. 
 So, normally I'd ask if you're ok, but since you're going round hitting people, Im guessing not? 
 No I'm not OK and I don't usually go round hitting people. 
 But I saw him and I felt like I had to do something. 
 Because he was the one who took her away from me. 
 Or at least I thought so in that... fleeting pathetic moment. 
 And now? 
 And... now I realize... she was lost to me the, the day I brought her here. 
 No, don't you dare say that. No you made a courageous decision, and you need to stick by that decision. 
 If she can't live with it, well that's her problem you know, cause if she'd given this place a chance, if she'd really given it a go, she'd be absolutely fine. 
 Oh ow. Sorry...sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 For what? Inflicting even more pain on you. 
 No, for your words. 
 Sorry, it wasn't very diplomatic. 
 Diplomacy's not...it's not really my thing. 
 No. (Fiona) No. 
 And, but please come to this thing, I don't want to piss anyone else off. 
 And they got a bouncy castle. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Hello? 
 (VAN BACKING UP) 
 G'day George Turner? 
 No I'm his site manager. 
 Whatever, sign here. 
 Right. 
 So what've we got? 
 Ohhh. 
 No worries. 
 Hey bro. 
 And um, your dad throws a pretty mean punch. 
 No he doesn't. 
 Yeah nah not really a. 
 So um do you want to take a swing too? 
 Why? 
 You and me we're just parts of a much bigger plan. 
 Hi Tracey. 
 Tracey from the nude beach? 
 I mean I prefer to think of myself as Tracey the teacher. 
 I'm sorry George just mentioned that's how you first met. 
 And it kind of sticks in the memory bank. 
 Anyway welcome to Weld, how are you liking it so far? 
 It's very beautiful. 
 Hannah : Is that the aussie chick? 
 Katie : Jan, yeah. 
 What's the deal with her and George? 
 Siouxsie, quit it with the face painting you're scaring the kids. 
 The kids love it, it's the parents who are scared. 
 Oh. 
 What? 
 This is excatly why I don't want to be here. 
 You see? You see all the people and what this place means to them? 
 Yes Katie I see all the people. 
 And then on Monday I can come back here and see the guy that the council pays to clean up the mess that all these people leave behind. 
 And then on Tuesday and Wednesday, I can come back here and see nothing. 
 And no one while this place sucks away whatever money we've got left. 
 Where are you going? 
 Home, could you tell Arlo and Jan where I am? 
 No you can't leave? 
 Why my work is done, Fiona's here and my hand hurts like hell. 
 You can't just walk away... you live here, you need to make a stand. 
 Why, what has Weld done for me apart from cost me my daughter. 
 What's up with this Jan woman? 
 Ah, she used to be Mums best friend. 
 (BOTH LAUGH & MAKE FUN) 
 Woah hey he he. 
 What? 
 Ok, so Katie used to be um my Mums best friend, back when my Mum was still with my Dad. 
 And then, they weren't best friends anymore. 
 Yeah, cause my Mum caught Katie and my Dad being way more then best friends. 
 Which is how Mum ended up having me. 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 Jan : George. 
 I have a column to write. 
 Well, should I come with you? 
 No stay. 
 Enjoy all that Weld has to offer. 
 Come to see what you are destroying have you? 
 Quite the opposite Katie. 
 Olivia here's the first to buy a unit off the plans. 
 So I'm introducing her to her new home. 
 Siouxsie : Come on guys, lets use the park while we still can. 
 Hey, what do you reckon? 
 Gosh, an oven. 
 Yeah, and she's all ready to go. 
 Did you install it yourself? 
 Oh come on George, what type of cowboy do you take me for? 
 Nah, called my mate Sparky, who is a sparky, and he owed me a favor. 
 Nah, she is kosher and ready to roast. 
 That's great, thanks Woody. 
 Yeah no worries mate. 
 Hello. 
 Hello Trish. 
 George. 
 Is Shay there? 
 No, no she's not, she's gone out. 
 Said she was meeting her friends, who are thrilled to have her back by the way. 
 Yeah, yeah I'm sure.

 Katie : Look at him, already thinks he owns the place. 
 How can you vote for him? 
 I'm not voting for him, I'm voting for the council not to put your rates up just to pay for this bloody place, god bless you. 
 I'd pay a bit more to keep this place the way it is. 
 I mean not much, but a little bit. 
 Katie : Why is it always about money? 
 I shouldn't. 
 Suit yourself. 
 Good turn out Katie. 
 Shows people care Bill. 
 Yeah, pity none of them have a say in what happens. 
 Unlike Fiona here. 
 I hope you're not having a belated attack of sentimentality? 
 Do I look like the sentimental type bill? 
 Absolutely not. 
 Good evening ladies. 
 Seriously how can you vote for that? 
 OK new rule, more drinking less politics. 
 Fiona : Thank you. 
 This really is a beautiful spot. 
 Tracey & Fiona : It's good isn't it. 
 So what's the deal with her? 
 She's the editor of the magazine that George writes for. 
 But she's like an old family friend, right? 
 Something like that. 
 So why's she here? 
 Is it because of Shay? 
 No, separate things. 
 Well, now she gets to pick up the pieces. 
 Jan : Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How was it? 
 Entertaining and educational. 
 Is Arlo with you? 
 No, should he be. 
 Sorry I haven't seen him for ages, I just assumed this was one of those places where it was safe to let your children roam the streets? 
 Yeah, I thought so too. 
 Right, sorry. Do you want me to go fetch him? 
 No no, it's fine. 
 That wasn't here this morning. 
 No. 
 What are you cooking? 
 Oh come on, I didn't come all this way not to eat your wonderful cooking. 
 I suppose I could rustle something up. 
 So point me to the wine cellar and I'll get the alcohol in. 
 Red, white. 
 (LAUGHS) Two of my favorite colors. 
 Why do you want to know where Jan is? 
 Fiona : Are you hitting on her? 
 I said I'd take her out on the boat, and I need to make arrangements. 
 All : Ohhhh arrangements. 
 Forget it. 
 Katie : If you want to be useful bring us more wine. 
 Fiona : And bring us some chips. 
 Tracey : And dip. 
 She'll be with George. 
 So, do we care? 
 Oh, we so care. 
 Speak for yourself. 
 Oh come on ladies lets be honest. 
 We've all thought about it. 
 You are far too young for him. 
 Yeah, but is he too old for me? 
 (ALL LAUGH) 
 What does that even mean? Oh it means, that I'm the only honest one here. 
 Katie? 
 George and I have an emotional connection. 
 And I am perfectly happy with that. 
 And have you ever thought about taking that, to a whole other connection? 
 What about you Miss Tracey? 
 Even if I wanted too, and I'm not saying I do. 
 Ah you so do. 
 I couldn't, because I teach his children. 
 And, what about you? 
 What about me? 
 Well, we haven't heard your denial yet. 
 George and I have an understanding. 
 You've actually spoken about it? 
 Well not about it specifically, though we agreed that in another time, maybe. 
 Anyway, what does it matter what we think or want or don't want? 
 I mean, it's all hypothetical now, isn't it? 
 And that's actually what we're all thinking, isn't it? 
 
 
 
 Fiona : Oh. 
 G'day. 
 Childern. 
 Ah, we're going go get some food, and then I'm going stay at Dads place. 
 You don't want camp with us? 
 You're welcome too Arlo. 
 Hell no. 
 Yeah, I'm good thank you. 
 OK. 
 All : Bye. 
 George : Just like that punch line, you had one job. 
 Now that was me after Laura, I had one job to keep the family together. 
 So you brought them here to make it harder for them to run away? 
 I never have thought of it that way but, until now. 
 Thank you very much for that. 
 You're welcome, but you do remember that kids inevitably eventually leave the nest right? 
 Not now. 
 Not this way. 
 Because she's too young or because you're not ready? 
 Both. 
 Well I remember when I was 18, going to the pub with my best friend. 
 No, no. 
 And we were so excited because we were...  
 No, don't. 
 .. actually legally allowed to drink and there... 
 No this is not fair. 
 .. was this guy working there behind the bar, and we went "ohh yum" so we decided to chat him up... 
 No. 
 .. and he wasn't actually a dickhead and then he chose her instead of me. 
 Laura and I were different from this. 
 Really? Cause her parents hated you on sight. 
 Nothing's changed there. 
 Especially when six months later she told her parents to get stuffed, and the two of you moved in together. 
 George.. your daughter.. takes after her Mum in so many ways. 
 Ow ow ow ow. 
 Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. 
 Ow ow. 
 Oh I'm sorry. 
 Oh... I am so useless at this. 
 At what? 
 Being around you without Laura just... doesn't, doesn't seem right. 
 I know. I know what you mean. 
 But, I'm really glad you showed up. 
 I'm not ready Jan. 
 I'm not ready for Shay to be out of my life. 
 But will you ever be? 
 (BREATHS) 
 (SNIFFS LOUDLY) 
 (SNIFFS LOUDLY) 
 (BONES CRACK) 
 (ALLEN GROANS) 
 Oh for god's shakes Allen. 
 Good morning. 
 There's nothing about this morning. 
 And if last night was an attempt to buy my vote. 
 Not a success. 
 I'm going home now. 
 I'm having a bath. 
 Not a morning person then. 
 (BIRDS CHIRPING OUTSIDE) 
 (BIRDS CHIRPING OUTSIDE) 
 (LONG BREATH) 
 (BIRDS CHIRPING OUTSIDE) 
 (OPENS DOOR) 
 (DOOR CREAKING) 
 (CLOSING DOOR) 
 (DOOR CREAKING) 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 How's the hand? 
 Yeah, it's better today thanks. 
 Good. 
 Hey did you check out the a... 
 Yeah (Both): Woody. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm off for a surf, I was going clean this up when I got back. 
 Nah, it's alright I got it. 
 I'll cook breakfast when I get back. 
 Cool, I'll look forward to it. 
 Arlo, I can do that. 
 Yep, sure. 
 I'm,  I'm off for a surf. 
 You can still do that with your hand? 
 Yeah, it'll be fine. 
 George. 
 Are we good? 
 Yeah, yeah we're good. 
 Um, and thank you. 
 For what? 
 For arriving at excatly the right time. 
 It's a talent. 
 Time zones Arlo, I'm two hours behind you remember? 
 Yeah much like in life. 
 Much to early for your stupid jokes. 
 What do you want? 
 Jan's here. 
 When she turn up? 
 The night you left. 
 Your planes must have liked crossed mid Tasman. 
 Why didn't you tell me yesterday? 
 What would have done? 
 Hopped on a plane straight back? 
 Exactly. 
 And cause ah, yesterday was all about you and your tragic cry for help. 
 How's Dad? 
 Dad is, thanks to you a emotional wreck. 
 Actually no, no this morning Dad is a really happy man. 
 He and Jan cooked up a storm last night, and we have a working kitchen by the way. 
 What you mean happy? 
 I think you get my drift. 
 Oh well, what will be will be. 
 That's it? 
 That's all you've got. 
 You were the with the phobia of cougars getting Dad. 
 He can do a lot worse than Jan. 
 Oh right, so now you don't live here, suddenly you don't care? 
 Dad's capable of making his own decisions. 
 No he's not. 
 Not anymore, you wounded him. 
 She arrived, she saw her chance, went for it and nailed it. 
 And that is all because of you. 
 Arlo, it's way too early in the day for me to be dealing with this stuff. 
 I need sleep, we'll talk when I'm awake. 
 (SHAY HANGS UP, LINE DISCONNECTS ON IPAD) 
 Thank you very much. 
 So, did you wet the babys head yet? 
 What? 
 The oven. 
 Oh oh, yes, yes I did. 
 Nice, so things are looking up then. 
 Are they looking up? 
 Well, they're certainly looking different that's for sure. 
 Things have changed greatly since yesterday. 
 Right. 
 And it still seems good, I think. 
 I mean.. felt good at the time. 
 Very good. 
 It's an oven mate. 
 Don't over think it. 
 Yeah. 
 Probably best not to. 
 Silver linings mate ok, they exist. 
 Take a look around you George. 
 There are people, billions of them who would give anything to stand where you are right now. 
 You need to remember that George Turner. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 How was the surf? 
 I didn't end up going in the end. 
 Because of your hand? 
 Yeah, it was worse than I thought. 
 Is this a George Turner special breakfast in the making? 
 Yeah, thought I'd whip something up. 
 Well have you time before the big meeting? 
 Wasn't planning on going. 
 Don't you want to see how it ends? 
 Just read about it in the paper. 
 Nonsense, come on we'll all go. 
 I'll get my shoes. 
 Looks like we're going to the meeting. 
 Yep, Mum has spoken. 
 (HANNAH LAUGHS) 
 I thought you aussies were all legendary drinkers? 
 Tracey : Well, not this one. 
 Hannah : Mmm, talk about letting the team down. 
 Tracey's not well. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 She's so bed him. 
 She just got here. 
 But she's had a lifetimes head start. 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 You're really getting the welcome to Weld experience aren't you? I mean the thing yesterday and now the big town meeting, and what ever else in-between. 
 It's certainly been all go. 
 How's the hand? 
 Oh yes fine.. fine thanks. 
 Good. 
 Hey Dad. 
 I just need to talk to Dad. 
 Oh sure, I'll save you some seats. 
 S.. so you're aware I.. I know happens? 
 Acutely aware, yeah. 
 And... 
 And what? 
 Well what does it mean? 
 I don't know. 
 Just happened. 
 I didn't except it to happen, I certainly wasnt looking for it to happen it just... happened, yeah, nah I get it. 
 The point is, I.. I'm not going have issues about what happened...  but what happened, happened and you can do what ever you want. 
 But wherever that might lead us... I.. 
 I need, I need you to know something. 
 I believe in you brining us here was a good idea. 
 You needed a fresh start. 
 So don't forget that. 
 Doug : I will open the floor to final submissions on the matter of the council selling the land commonly known as the old camping grounds. 
 For god's sake, can't you control your daughter? 
 Nope, not in the slightest. 
 What I want to know is why no consideration has been given to the environmental impact this development will have on the population levels of the Tetogryllus commodus, the Black Field Cricket. 
 So it is my opinion that it be sold, before there are any job losses at the council. 
 I look forward to the day when the main street of Weld is bumber to bumber with mobility scooters. 
 This is just wrong, it's not us, it's not the Weld I grew up in. 
 Can I just get you all to move in a bit, thanks. 
 Thank you. 
 So unless anybody else has got anything to contribute we will move on. 
 Ah, yeah yeah I do. 
 (CROWD CHATTERING) 
 Ahh, G'day guys, um look I won't keep youse long cause I'm not very good with words, ah I wish I was, ah a man of words cause, men of words they're you know. 
 They're rare things around here... and if there was any such man that had the right words at his fingertips well, I reckon he might say... 
 You want me to take a moment Woody? 
 Yeah if you don't mind? 
 Thank you Woody. 
 No worries. 
 I used to take things for granted, I think we all do, we can't help it. 
 Especially if you live in Weld. 
 I mean, what's the big deal about a camping ground when we're surrounded by so much beauty. 
 But my daughter thought it was a big deal. 
 I think most of you know, well all of you, because this is Weld. 
 That she was actively expressing her views about the proposed development. 
 She never shared any of this with me, but the one time we came close to talking about it, she said something that now, I'm just beginning to understand what she meant. 
 She said...  when something precious is gone, it doesn't come back. 
 Well she's gone now... 
 .. but I'm still here. 
 And I can't sit on the fence any longer, so I oppose the sale of this land because.. 
 .. once beauty is gone.. you can't get it back. 
 (CROWD CLAPPING) 
 Doug : Ok right, if we're done with the old submissions I guess we're ready to vote on the proposal that the Weld Dristict Council sells the land in question for the price on offer to Weld Village Developments Limited. How do we vote? 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 Doug : Fiona? 
 No. 
 I'm sorry? 
 No, I oppose the sale. 
 Doug? 
 I vote yes. 
 The motion has passed. 
 I thought Doug was on our side? 
 We shall begin the sale process. 
 Doug, what the hell was that? 
 Can't talk, have to go. 
 (FIONA LAUGHS) 
 We so should have seen that coming. 
 What is the one business that's definitely going benefit from a old folks home? 
 Big Mac must've offered him a contract in exchange for being a safety vote, in case it flip flopped. 
 So he was always going win. 
 Lovely words George. 
 Excellent what you said. 
 Your're like our very own Tom Hanks. 
 I almost shed a tear there George. 
 Despite the fundamental levels of disagreement. 
 Bowls whenever you're ready. 
 Really nice speech George. 
 Even if it means we are now mortal enemies a. 
 Arlo. 
 Oh what do you want Lindsay? 
 My sisters gone ok, I..is that not enough for you? 
 I just wanted to ask if you're ok, alright? 
 And how Shay is. 
 I kind of know what it's like with the whole Ike thing. 
 But fine, whatever. Spin out all you want, if that works with you. 
 (MOBILE RINGING) 
 It's you. 
 The old me, you should go write you column, no point both of us being unemployed. 
 (BREATHS IN) 
 (BREATHS OUT) 
 Arlo. 
 I'm.. I'm, I'm not sure if you're aware of what happened between your Dad and I last night? 
 Yeah, I'm... I'm aware. 
 Right... well um, I just want you to know that I'd never...  I'm not trying to replace your Mum. 
 Yeah you are. 
 You've been in love with Dad for years. 
 What? 
 What if I have? 
 Well um, I just need you to know, you will never replace her. 
 (VIDEO CALL RINGING) 
 Hi Dad. 
 Hey love. 
 You ok? 
 Yeah, what about you? 
 Yeah, I'm alright. 
 You been catching up with friends? 
 Sort of. 
 I don't know what to do Shay? 
 You don't have to do anything. 
 Well, that's where you're wrong. I want my family to be back together again, it hurt to much when your Mother died. 
 And this feels like that all over again. 
 That's not fair. 
 Well I'm sorry but that's how I feel and I want to know what to do change that? 
 Come back here, they're not ghosts Dad. 
 They're memories, they're good things. 
 Not to me. 
 I think bringing us here was a good call, I wish you agreed but clearly you don't. 
 So what do we do about it? 
 Hasn't it all been done? 
 (SCOFFS) Not by a long shot. 
 Dad, no matter where we are, you know I will always love you right? 
 So I want you to watch out that your heart doesn't take you places you shouldn't go. 
 Like the places where... 
 (VIDEO CALL BREAKS UP) 
 No. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Like the places where you think you'll be happy. 
 But you'll only get hurt. 
 ♪ That's the state of my mind. ♪ 
♪ Oh when you're gonna let me outta this. ♪ 
 You do know you can't paddle back to Australia right? 
 Yes Woody, I do know that. 
 Woody : Man it's peaceful out here. 
 Good place for a man to make important choices I reckon. 
 Which way you heading George? 
 East, West, forwards... or backwards? 
 Round and round in ever increasing circles. 
 At which time it's probably a good idea to remember why you came here in the first place. 
 Give the kids a new life you know. 
 A fresh start. 
 Really? 
 Cause I thought you came here to surf? 
 Here comes your wave George. 
 ♪ Whoo who, whoo who. ♪ 
♪ The world is my friend. ♪ 
♪ Whoo who, whoo who. ♪ 
♪ Must have fallen asleep that day. ♪ 
♪ Whoo who, whoo who ♪ 
 When everything is said and done. 
 But there is still so much left unsaid. 
 You have to put a stake in the ground. 
 You have to say "This is me." 
 "This is I live." 
 "Where I stand." 
 "But make no mistake,... one way or another... my family will stand with me." 
 "All of them." 
 I love you Shay, no matter what you do or where you are.
