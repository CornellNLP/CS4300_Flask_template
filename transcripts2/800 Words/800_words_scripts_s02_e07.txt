 George : Fact - people die. 
 Fact - when someone dies, what makes them real, makes them human, goes with them. 
 I know this to be true from the hours that I spent sitting with my wife in the days after she died. 
 Her face, the one I'd loved for so many years, was the same face. 
 But the person I loved was no longer in residence. 
 Laura had left the building. 
 Fact - just because someone has left the building doesn't mean they can't come back to be... 
 A complete pain in the proverbial backside. 
 Hey there, you. 
 Hey there, you. 
 Hope I'm not disturbing you. 
 No, no. Same old, same old. 
 Just thought you might like to know we're coming over. 
 To here? 
 Yep. 
 For the one year. 
 Oh, my god. Has it been a year? 
 Almost. 
 Holy... 
 Exactly. 
 Roger and Trish are very keen that we're all there. 
 They have something planned. 
 They do? What? 
 They won't say. 
 Uh, I don't see this ending well. 
 Yep. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. 
 One year. 
 Far out. 
 Yeah, exactly. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Think it'll sneak up on me when I least expect it, which is why, I suspect, I will need you by my side. 
 When is this thing they've got planned? 
 Well, we're looking at heading over next week for a week or so. 
 Bugger, I'm not here. 
 You're not? 
 No, I'm away on a story in Perth. 
 You're the editor. 
 You never leave the office. 
 Times are tough, George. Even the editor has to go to the coalface. 
 Can't you get a lackey to do it? 
 No. 
 Not next week, I'm afraid. Sorry. 
 Bugger. 
 Bugger. 
 What do you think they've got planned? 
 I mean, I know we should go and we definitely need to do something for Mum but... 
 Oi. 
 I was kind of hoping we could do something here. 
 Why is that, Arlo? Because you finally got a girlfriend? 
 Yes, actually. 
 And there is a clock ticking until she leaves. 
 Maybe Anna can come with us. 
 We're not going to Sydney. 
 Yes, we are. 
 No, we're not. 
 Are we good? 
 You and I? Yeah, of course. 
 Just, you seem a bit... 
 We're fine, George. 
 I'm just bummed I'm not gonna be here to hold your hand for the Roger and Trish show. 
 Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. 
 Yeah, well, just grit your teeth and remember it's all about Laura. 
 (RINGTONE PLAYS) 
 And, speak of the devil, Roger and Trish. 
 Probably with a dress code for the event. 
 Yeah, well, you better take that. 
 Absolutely, I must. 
 George? 
 Trish. It's me. 
 Did you put her up to it? 
 Arlo : Seriously, why aren't we going to Sydney? 
 Put who up to what? 
 Shay. 
 But I agreed to pay you back for the ticket. 
 Not that. 
 What she took with her. 
 Sorry? 
 I'm not giving her back? 
 Giving who back? 
 She what? 
 We went to check on Laura's ashes in the urn when we were talking about the crypt and they weren't there. 
 Sorry, the what? 
 The crypt, though mausoleum is more accurate and ornamental house is... 
 The point is, George, Laura's ashes were not in her urn. 
 And you think Shay took them? 
 Who else? 
 Well, are you sure your cleaner didn't put them up the vacuum cleaner? 
 This is my daughter you're talking about. 
 And my wife. 
 All of us were told, in no uncertain terms, never to touch the urn. 
 We're sure it was Shay, George. 
 Shay. 
 Yeah. 
 We're definitely not going to Sydney. 
 Shay, what are they talking about? 
 Grandpa was talking about building this thing for Mum. 
 A crypt. 
 Yeah, this monument where he and Grandma could show off dead Mum to their mates and it freaked me out really bad. 
 Mum would die, even more, being stuck in a place like that for eternity. 
 You get what I'm saying, right? 
 So, you stole the ashes? 
 I defended Mum against... 
 You took Laura's ashes and you brought them here, right? 
 Yes. 
 You smuggled Mum into New Zealand? 
 Yes, didn't I just say that? 
 And no-one noticed you had the remains of our mother in your luggage? 
 Obviously not. 
 But New Zealand is, like, obsessed with biosecurity. 
 Which part of "obviously not" wasn't obvious enough for you? 
 Where's Laura now? 
 Well, that's dignified. 
 It's more dignified than what they were planning. 
 Dubious. 
 No, Arlo. I saved her. 
 I literally saved Mum from a fate worse than death. 
 Yes, the ashes are here and they're intact. 
 Then you need to bring them back when you come over. 
 No. That's not gonna happen. 
 I told you he'd side with her. 
 Look, it's not a question of me siding with Shay. 
 It's a question of me being weirded out by this whole thing. 
 I'm not even sure what the laws are when it comes to transporting ashes between countries, for a start. 
 Well, that didn't seem to worry Shay. 
 Yeah, well, young people don't think about things like that. I do. 
 So, she wins? 
 It's not a question of winning, Trish. 
 Why didn't you tell me about the crypt? 
 We assumed, when you left her ashes with us, it was our call. 
 No. No, it was... 
 It was the best way to deal with things at the time. 
 We agreed that we would talk about it after a year. 
 And we thought you'd like the idea so we went ahead. 
 Well, I don't, starting with the word crypt. 
 It freaks me out, like Laura's gonna rise up, wrapped in bandages. 
 Which is why you don't dwell on the word... 
 Look, if you're not going to bring her back here, well, send her back. 
 What? No, I'm not putting Laura in a box and posting her back to you. 
 So, you get to keep her? 
 Only until we work something out. 
 And it is not gonna be a crypt. 
 Do you have a better suggestion? 
 No. 
 No, I... 
 I don't. 
 We'll come to you. 
 Obviously, we need to sort this out face to face, so it's best we come to you, unless you have a better suggestion. 
 No. 
 No. 
 No. 
 Good. 
 And goodnight. 
 Night. 
 Thank you. 
 For what? 
 Not giving in to them. 
 Don't. 
 Don't what? 
 Don't try and make me a hero when all I want to do is be furious with you. 
 I did what you would've done. 
 Not necessarily. 
 Fine. Then I did what was right. 
 And now the grandparents of the apocalypse are heading this way. 
 Are they gonna stay here with us? 
 There must be something somewhere. 
 You do grasp what time of year it is, don't you, George? 
 Yes, yes, when all the summer people flock into town. 
 There is so little accommodation available that we don't even run an Accommodation Available section because it just gets people's hopes up. 
 What about the yurt place? 
 The what place? 
 The yurt place. 
 I don't think George's in-laws sound like yurt people, honey. 
 Well, that depends. What's a yurt? 
 It's a portable structure the Mongol hordes carried with them as they swept across Asia. 
 I didn't think the Mongol hordes made it as far as Weld. 
 They didn't but hippies did. 
 And, for a fee, they will erect a yurt in your backyard. 
 Yeah, well, there are certain Mongol horde similarities but Gloria's right - 
 I don't think they're yurt people. 
 I think all those yurts are being used up in the Drum and Bass Festival near Stafford anyway. 
 Could always try the motel. 
 They get a lot of cancellations. 
 I've stayed at that motel. 
 I know why they get cancellations. 
 That's us out of options. 
 Unless Monty has something empty. 
 Sorry, George, but this time of year... 
 ..even the least desirable property is desired in ways that bring joy to the heart of the agent renting them. 
 There's not something on the market that's standing empty? 
 Those, prize snapper, have long since swum off to spawn many, many rental dollars. 
 You could try the yurt place. 
 Something about a Drum and Bass Festival. 
 Ah, right, yeah. 
 They're pretty big on yurts, the drum and basses. 
 Hey, why don't you try the motel? 
 They've always got cancellations. 
 At least, if they stay at the motel, they'll have some idea what it's like to be stuck in a crypt. 
 The best thing you can do for the foreseeable future, young lady, is remain very quiet. 
 Did you seriously just use the phrase "young lady"? 
 So, I guess they'll be staying with us then. 
 We can put them in my room and I'll sleep on the couch. 
 Oh, yeah, they're so gonna love that. 
 Everything OK here? 
 Yes, it's excellent, thanks, Emma. 
 She... she really does try her best. 
 Yeah, not that you're biased. 
 We need to get them in the best frame of mind possible, alright? 
 Well, staying at our place isn't gonna help that. 
 They like to drink. 
 Well, so, we just keep them drunk all the time. 
 Can't hurt. 
 Hey, Woody, you wouldn't be able to whip up a brand-new bedroom with ensuite by tomorrow, can ya? 
 With ensuite. 
 Uh, it's a bit tricky with all the plumbing and, no, I can't because I promised Trace that I would fix her cupboard door that's been sticking. 
 Why? What's the big rush? 
 Laura's parents are coming to visit. 
 Oh, the flash ones. 
 Yep. Them. 
 Coming to see the grandkids, eh? 
 Aw, that's nice. 
 It's not that straightforward. 
 It's been one year since Laura passed away. 
 Oh, my god. 
 Momentous. 
 Well, you know, if I could help, I would, mate. 
 Woody, I didn't really expect you to whip me up a room in 24 hours. 
 We just need to find somewhere for them to stay, somewhere nice. 
 You should try the motel. 
 He said nice, Woody. 
 I can sort something out for you. 
 I thought everything was full up at this time of year. 
 It is, except this place. 
 How come? 
 Are you looking a gift horse in the mouth, George? 
 Well, no offence but these are very picky people. 
 OK, well, how about you finish your lunch and then you and I can take a drive and, if it doesn't meet your very high standards, you can carry on looking elsewhere. 
 Truly can't be any worse than the motel. 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 George : Emotions can be managed up to a point. 
 The right setting, the right ambience, can go a long way towards the desired tone, the best in which... 
 Ideally. 
 ..emotions can be massaged and moulded. 
 How is this place empty at this time of year? 
 Oh, long-ish story. 
 Think it'll do the trick? 
 Oh, they'll find fault in it, as they always do, but it's light years better than staying at my place. 
 This is great. 
 Suitable for your in-laws? 
 Absolutely. 
 And I'm not just saying that because the best alternative this far is a yurt. 
 The yurts are all in Stafford. 
 So, why is it empty? 
 How long are they staying? 
 Well, that very much depends on how the negotiations go. 
 I'm sorry? 
 It's been a year since Laura died. 
 Oh, my god. 
 We were meant to be going over there but there's a slight problem, in that Shay... 
 ..hijacked the ashes. 
 What? 
 When Shay came back from Sydney, she brought Laura... 
 ..or at least Laura's ashes with her. 
 Oh. K. 
 Let's just say there's an ongoing dispute over the final resting place. 
 So, I can rent this from whoever owns it for as long as they stay? 
 Oh, it's fine. 
 I don't want money. 
 This is your place? 
 Yeah. 
 In a roundabout sort of way. 
 But what about where you live? 
 Also mine. 
 I'm a lady of property. 
 I'm quite a catch, actually. 
 This house was given to Robbie and me on our wedding day. 
 Big Mac. 
 Got it in one. 
 Generous man. 
 Well, the catch was we were to fill it with grandchildren but, of course, Robbie moved out by moving to prison and I couldn't stand being here anymore so moved back to my old place. 
 It's been empty ever since. 
 Actually, you should probably speak to Big Mac, even though, legally, it belongs to Robbie and me. 
 You know what he's like. 
 In his head, it still belongs to him. 
 You're onto it. 
 Are you OK? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 One year. 
 You know, I haven't really stopped to think about it yet. 
 Events have kind of gotten in the way. 
 Well, when you do, if you need a shoulder to cry on... 
 Thank you. 
 How on earth did you get her through customs? 
 In a boot. 
 A boot? 
 Yes, stuffed in my boot in my bag and, yes, I'm a terrible person and it really wasn't dignified but I was in a hurry to get out of there so I... 
 I...it was what worked at the time. 
 No-one's saying you're a terrible person. 
 This thing that my grandparents were talking about building. 
 The crypt. 
 Yes. 
 It sounded hideous. 
 It was a monument to them, not her. 
 Ooh, the crypt. 
 Will you stop saying that? 
 Sorry. Just, it's a cool word. 
 But my mum isn't ending up in one, if I have anything to do with it. 
 So, where is she now, your mum, her ashes? 
 In a plastic bag in a bowl on the kitchen bench. 
 Oh, no. No, that won't do at all. 
 Come with me. 
 Where? 
 You'll see. Come with me. 
 And she was actually at the house when she made this offer? 
 Yes. 
 Wow. 
 After vowing she would never again set foot in my exceedingly generous gift? 
 I think she was just trying to do me a favour and it is a lovely house. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 And these are Laura's parents? 
 Yes. With all that that entails. 
 Which is what? 
 Well, they're old-school, money, Sydney with certain expectations. 
 Certainly ones that I've never been able to live up to. 
 They sound fascinating. 
 That's another word for it. 
 Yes, of course you can use the house, George. 
 Thanks. 
 On one condition. 
 Which is? 
 You let me host a party for them when they arrive. 
 It can be a celebration of family. 
 Um... 
 (MOTOR STARTS) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Accommodation issue sorted. 
 That's good. 
 You need to grab Arlo and come to Zac's place. 
 Why? What have you done now? 
 I haven't done anything. 
 Get your arse up here, George. 
 It's all good. 
 Why do Arlo and I need to go to Zac's? 
 I don't know. They won't tell me until you guys get here. 
 They just keep smiling at me. 
 OK. On my way. 
 Hello. 
 Ohp, got it. 
 Still can't believe you smuggled your mum. 
 That's some balls right there. 
 Didn't really think of it like that. 
 Oh. 
 In terms of balls. 
 I like that you did what you thought was right. 
 Hey. Welcome. 
 Have a seat. 
 As requested, here we are. 
 Go and get the thing. 
 Why are we here? 
 When families argue over things like this, usually the one who gets forgotten is the most important person in the room. 
 Which is why, luckily, Zac has one or two skills, beyond fathering children. 
 The thing is, we get how families will always argue about what happens to loved ones long after the loved one shuffles off. 
 And that's why we have hura kohatu. 
 A year after the passing in Latangi, everyone gets together again and the headstone is unveiled. 
 And all the arguments that happened the year before are meant to be put to rest. 
 Sometimes they are, sometimes not so much. 
 But we figure, even if you guys are still arguing over Laura a year later, she may as well be resting in something made with aroha while you do it. 
 Aroha means love. 
 Yeah, I got the context, thanks, Billy. 
 It's gotta be better than a plastic bag, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Or some well-manicured version of the ever after. 
 Laura would've hated it with a passion. 
 Thank you, Zac. 
 Just looking after the loved ones. 
 That's what it's all about. 
 OK. Bring it on. 
 Did you scrub the toilet? 
 Yes. 
 Properly? 
 Yes, it sparkles. 
 You could eat lunch off the bowl. 
 Did you vacuum everywhere? 
 Dad, it doesn't matter. 
 Nothing we do will be good enough. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 True. But it's good to know. 
 Then yes. 
 Hello, Trish. 
 The address you gave us, are you sure that's right? 
 Yes. Why? 
 We're outside that address. 
 Frankly, the place is a dump. 
 Shay said you were having work done but this places looks half finished, at best, and like it's been thrown together... 
 Yeah. Hi. 
 So, how was your flight? 
 It took off, landed. 
 Everything you want in a flight. 
 Good. 
 And the drive down? 
 Yeah, not much traffic. 
 A little bit off the beaten path here. 
 It is. 
 We like Weld. 
 It suits us. 
 We had to cancel everything, you know? 
 Cancel what? 
 A lot of our friends. 
 Most of the partners from Laura's firm. 
 It was very embarrassing. 
 Well, I'm sorry about that. 
 Where is she? 
 Shay? 
 We had no idea you had such a big deal planned. 
 It was meant to be a surprise. 
 This is by a local craftsman. 
 This is your plan for her final resting place? 
 No, we don't actually have a plan. 
 Then you won't mind if we take Laura home with us. 
 Yes, we do, actually, and that is what we're here to talk about. 
 So, let us talk. 
 No, not now. 
 There's a party in your honour tonight. 
 In our honour? 
 Yes. You'll see. 
 And I need to get you to your accommodation. 
 Well, we're not staying here? 
 No, we don't actually have a spare room. 
 So, I arranged a house. 
 Well, that's a pity. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Shall we go now? 
 Big Mac will send a car for you. 
 Big Mac, as in the hamburger? 
 No, as in Bill McNamara, it's just what people call him. 
 Is it formal because we haven't exactly packed...? 
 Whatever you wear will be fine. 
 You entrusted her to us. 
 I had many other things on my mind. 
 Going mad? Shifting our only grandchildren to another country? 
 This would never have happened if you'd stayed in Sydney. 
 We'd still have to have this conversation, though. 
 Or you quite simply could've accepted our very generous offer. 
 No. 
 I'm with Shay on this one. 
 This whole crypt idea... 
 It helps if you don't think of it as a crypt. 
 Whatever you call it, Roger, it doesn't sound right to me. 
 It doesn't sound like Laura. 
 And do you have a better idea, George? 
 That's what we'll talk about. 
 The car will be here at 5. 
 Dad, do we have to go? 
 Yes. 
 So, Grandma can have a go at me in front of Big Mac's rich mates? Yay. 
 Trish knows how to play nice in social situations. 
 Oh, until she gets half a dozen wines into her. 
 OK, here's the thing. 
 Yes, Trish is angry with Shay, with all of us. 
 Mainly with Shay. 
 So, what we have to do is get round that so we can knock this whole crypt idea on the head. 
 And that job starts tonight and we all have to play our part. 
 You got that? 
 Which is why we are going to Big Mac's party and we are going to enjoy it, no matter how much we hate it. 
 Alright? 
 
 
 
 Ah, here's our driver. 
 Uh, hello. 
 Kia or a, tena korua. 
 What's that mean? 
 Means hello to the two of you. 
 Uh. Is that Maori? 
 Yes, it is. Yes, it is. 
 Are you a Maori? 
 No. 
 Maybe. Maybe a teeny bit, somewhere in the past. You never know. 
 But, fundamentally, no. 
 Then why are you speaking Maori? 
 Oh, I'm just trying to show you a little bit of local culture. 
 And you're this Big Mac fellow's driver? 
 No. 
 I'm his son. 
 But, also, yes. 
 Who are these people? 
 I think this is Weld's version of Downton Abbey. 
 The rich bit. 
 We may be the plebs here but we are definitely at the right party. 
 Wee tipple, George? 
 Non-alcoholic, please. 
 I might need to keep my wits about me. 
 Yeah. They're interesting, your in-laws, aren't they? 
 Special. 
 Yeah. Very. 
 Best of luck for your one-year thing, aye? 
 Thanks, Monty. 
 Need a friendly face? 
 Yes, please. 
 Welcome to the social elite. 
 A whole new world to me. 
 Mmm. Old world to me. 
 Clearly, you still have enough standing to make the invite list. 
 I seriously doubt that, although he was very insistent that I be here. 
 Maybe he knew I'd need some moral support. 
 Maybe he did. 
 We could spread Mum in the garden around the house. 
 As in, fertiliser? 
 OK, maybe not. 
 Hey, grave robber. 
 Don't call me that. 
 But that thing you did with the ash smuggling, totally on my bucket list. 
 Don't tell Dad. 
 What about at the bottom of the property, overlooking the sea? 
 Where Woody built the long drop? 
 Well, yeah, no-one ever used it. 
 And the view is great. 
 My dad has a secret supply of sky rockets. 
 We could blast your mum into orbit. 
 No. 
 Why not? It'd be awesome. 
 No. 
 We're trying to figure out how to dispose of Laura's body. 
 Ashes, not body. 
 Same diff. 
 Yeah, but not a crypt. 
 I'd hate to end up in one of those things. They are creepy. 
 Exactly. 
 It's OK, Dad. 
 When you die, I'm gonna have you stuffed and mounted on the wall like this. 
 Yeah. You can wheel me out to scare the kids at Halloween. 
 You're onto it. 
 My dearly departed Norma has a lovely headstone, nothing like what Roger says you're planning, but it's so comforting to go there to remember. 
 A place. Just for her. 
 Exactly. 
 Been a few years since we've been up to visit her, mind you. 
 That's not the point, Bill. 
 Knowing there's a place. 
 That's the important thing. 
 Entirely. 
 It's because Dad's off the rum. 
 Dad, here, he's a bit emotional when he gets a few rums in him. 
 The rum demon, we call it. 
 Shouldn't you be attending to the barbeque? 
 The word crypt is inaccurate in this case because a crypt is typically underground. 
 What we're looking at is better termed a mausoleum. 
 It doesn't matter what it's called, Grandpa. It's still wrong. 
 Well, if you'd stayed around long enough to see the plans, you'd think differently. 
 I wouldn't bet on that. 
 The people at the cemetery call it an ornamental house. 
 Trish and I will both end up there too. 
 And you two, if you want. 
 It costs an absolute fortune but they're very peaceful. 
 (SOMEONE DINGS A WINE GLASS) 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 I won't take up too much of your time. 
 Heard that one before. 
 I just want to thank you all for coming at such short notice and especially to welcome Roger and Trish, our guests of honour, here to Weld. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Hear, hear. 
 We wholeheartedly acknowledge that the reasons they're here aren't exactly ideal. 
 But we hope that they find the healing they seek in our little town. 
 Family. 
 There's nothing more important. 
 But it isn't easy and sometimes the lessons we learn aren't exactly palatable. 
 As most of you know, my family's been through a hard time over the last little while. 
 My son, Robbie, strayed from the path and ended up leaving us. 
 But just today I've heard some wonderful news. 
 My lawyers have done what lawyers do and I'm sure I'll be getting the bill for it. 
 But the point is that my son is coming home very soon. 
 There's still a lot of healing to be done but I live in hope that we can put the past behind us. 
 And, like Roger and Trish here, we can move forward knowing that family is the most important thing. 
 To family. Cheers. 
 Man : To family. 
 Fiona. Fiona, hold on. 
 My guess is you knew none of that. 
 Good guess, George. 
 You OK? 
 No, I'm not OK. 
 Sorry. 
 It's not your fault. 
 Ooh, he's such a b*st*rd. 
 You know, it's so typical. 
 He didn't even have the balls to call me and tell me in person. 
 He had to bring me here so he could tell all of his mates, so they could all just take a good, long look at the woman that put his son in prison, just to remind everyone who the bad person is here. 
 That's not remotely true, Fiona. 
 You were invited because you're important to Weld and to me. 
 And I only found out about Robbie 20 minutes ago. 
 Could have taken me aside, have a quiet word. 
 Oh, I think you gave up that right when you went to the police instead of coming to me. 
 So, you can sweep it all under the rug. 
 Sorted out in a family way. 
 He still loves you, you know. 
 Good for him. 
 You should write an editorial about prodigal sons and forgiveness. 
 I'll leave that to you, Big Mac. 
 Oh, come on, George. 
 Even you must realise there are certain parallels to our family situations. 
 Forgiveness required. 
 Decisions to be made. 
 You don't have to worry about the house, though. 
 One of the rules is that Robbie has to stay with me. 
 So, Roger and Trish can stay as long as they like. 
 They're delightful people. 
 Basically, Uncle Robbie was the golden child. 
 He was everything my dad never was and could never be. 
 But he ended up in prison. 
 Yeah. 
 He was also a drug-dealing scumbag who ripped off a whole lot of people. 
 And you think your family sucks. 
 All I'm saying, Roger, is, putting what Shay did to one side, we all need to agree on this. 
 What I'm saying, George, is I hear you. 
 But you're only speaking to the chequebook. 
 How many has she had? 
 Enough. 
 You need to know... 
 Sure, but does it have to be now? 
 We took you in, we gave you every opportunity... 
 Honey, maybe we can save this... 
 She needs to know she took what we gave her and threw it back in our faces. 
 And we can talk about all that sort of stuff. 
 Arlo, go and tell Big Mac that Roger and Trish are leaving now. 
 You are an ungrateful little cow. 
 Enough, Trish. 
 You want to talk? 
 Isn't that what we're doing tomorrow? 
 You know what I meant. 
 Thank you but no. 
 I just want to sleep. 
 I'm not tired. 
 I might stay up for a bit. 
 Sure. Night. 
 Night. 
 George : Where emotion and politics and history cloud things, what you need is that person... 
 That special person. 
 ..who can cut through the fog to shine a light of clarity on the big mess happening before your eyes. 
 Aunty Fiona came home and slammed round the kitchen, opening wine. 
 (SOFT CHUCKLE) 
 Then turned up the old music she always plays when she's sad or angry. 
 When I left, the music was still playing but she was snoring on the couch. 
 Yeah, that's got something to do with someone getting out of jail. 
 Mmm. Uncle Robbie, the drug dealer. 
 OK. 
 Meanwhile, all I have to worry about is everyone arguing over some ashes. 
 That and Shay being a huge disappointment. 
 I don't get that. 
 Well, Grandma wanted Shay to be just like Mum... 
 No, I mean about the ashes. 
 It's not like the actual person's here anymore. 
 So, what does it matter? 
 Tell my grandparents that. 
 Sorry. That's your job. 
 Oh. I wondered when you'd get here. 
 Are you psychic, Woody? 
 I knew you were gonna say that. 
 Nah, I didn't really. 
 Nah, I just figured you'd probably want to see a friendly face, you know, today of all days. 
 It is today, isn't it? 
 Yes, it is. 
 The one-year day. 
 You alright? 
 I'd like to say I'm fine but I suspect I'm not. 
 Yeah. As I suspected. 
 You're very perceptive. 
 I am, George, which is why I figured you'd need a surf today. 
 You know, despite it being the... 
 Non-surfing period for locals? 
 Yeah, but I think today we can make an exception, aye? 
 Well, are you sure that's wise after your...? 
 George, there is nothing wrong with my noggin that wasn't already wrong with it. 
 Are they doing follow-up tests? 
 Enough about me. 
 Today is about you, my friend. 
 And Laura. 
 Yes. Laura as well. 
 And Roger and Trish and Shay and Arlo. 
 Yeah, all of 'em, all of 'em, but right here, right now, you and me are gonna go and rip the livin' daylights out of her. 
 (CHEEKY LAUGH) 
 Seriously, are they doing brain tests on you?

 Uh, you guys are up early. 
 We're early risers. 
 Yeah, well, I thought maybe after last night... 
 The place was open so we let ourselves in. 
 I'm sure that's how it works around here. 
 Yes, absolutely. 
 The kids are sound sleepers. 
 They'll be up soon. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Breakfast? 
 Why don't I get breakfast started? 
 That usually gets them up. 
 (ROCK TUNE PLAYS) 
 ♪ Well this is no ordinary day... ♪ 
 Good morning. 
 Trish : Morning, Arlo. 
 (PHONE BUZZES) 
 Hey, it's George here. 
 Just checking. 
 Hope you're OK after last night. 
 Can you call me when you get this? 
 You're not hungry, Trish? 
 I'm fine. Thank you, George. 
 So, how'd the exams go? 
 Good. Excellent endorsements across the board. 
 And that's good, eh? 
 Can't really get much better. 
 These are these New Zealand exams, right? 
 NCEA. 
 Do they hold any weight in the real world? 
 I have no idea. 
 But, you know, excellent. 
 Sounds good. Well done. 
 It's good that someone's doing well at school. 
 Oh, and away we go. 
 We took you in! 
 And we gave you every opportunity and how did you repay us? 
 Well, I'm gonna be paying for it forever, Grandma. 
 I'm well aware of that. 
 Today is the day. 
 One year to the day. 
 Now, however it happened, she's here now so shouldn't we be talking about that, what we're gonna do with Laura? 
 We have made our position very clear on that matter. 
 That is true and we have made our position equally as clear. 
 Without offering any alternative. 
 Well, that is what we are here to discuss. 
 I suppose we could take half each. 
 We are not dividing Mum in half. 
 We have a place for her to rest where we can visit her. 
 And what's the alternative? 
 What alternative have you got? 
 That she stays here, a place that she has never been? 
 A place that you would never have come to if she hadn't died? 
 Better than spending eternity in some monstrosity just so you can show off to your rich mates. 
 That's unfair. 
 Is it? Mum would hate your idea. 
 You don't know that. 
 Yes, I do. 
 It goes against everything she believed in. 
 Nonsense. 
 This is my mother we're talking about. I think I would... 
 And my daughter! 
 Mine. My only girl. 
 My beautiful, beautiful girl who I miss every second of every day. 
 And you think I don't? 
 It's different for you. 
 You're young. 
 Children should never die before their parents. 
 It's just wrong. 
 Can I say something here? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Mum's dead. 
 Oh, duh, genius. 
 No, listen to me. 
 Mum's dead. 
 She's gone. 
 You know, whatever is in that box, that isn't her. 
 Mum lives in here now. 
 And here. 
 So, to me, anyway, arguing over a handful of ashes on the day when we're supposed to be remembering her, laughing at stories at her and crying if we want to, I think Mum would be really pissed if she heard us. 
 If she were here to hear us. 
 That's all. 
 OK. Come with me. 
 Come on. 
 Where? 
 You'll see. 
 Shay. Bring Laura. 
 George : There is an innocence to youth, a worldview unclouded by history and the politics of everyday life. 
 One of the great things about innocence is that it is an excellent aid to clarity. 
 As it turns out. 
 Hey, run up ahead and check there's no locals doing local things, alright? 
 Well, there are no cars here. 
 Just better to be safe that sorry. 
 Where's he off to? 
 A call of nature. 
 This way. 
 (EXCITED CHATTING) 
 Man : Yes. Come on, get in. 
 Arlo : No. No, no. 
 Woody : Don't push me! 
 (GIGGLING) 
 Oh. 
 Hey. G'day, Arly. 
 Coming in for a swim, mate? 
 Hey, don't mind us. 
 We've just been hiking so... 
 Will we jump in...? 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 What are you doin'? 
 Just not now. Please. 
 What? 
 Just go, hike. 
 Righto. Alright. 
 Come on. 
 OK. 
 You OK? 
 Yep. All good. 
 So, what do you think? 
 About what? 
 Here. 
 It's very pretty. 
 Are you suggesting we scatter her ashes here? 
 Why not? 
 A place that means nothing to Laura. 
 Well, isn't that always gonna be the case? 
 I mean, Laura's never been to this ornamental thing that you're building for her. 
 Yeah, well, that's different. 
 Is it? 
 Yeah. 
 Why? 
 'Cause it's purpose built as a place to house the remains. 
 The remains. 
 Is that why you're gonna go there every anniversary of Laura's death? 
 Because her remains are there? 
 It's a place to go and remember and that's all it will ever be. 
 If you're going there and thinking about her remains, then I reckon you're thinking about all the wrong things. 
 This place... 
 I know Laura never came here. 
 But, if she had... 
 ..I reckon she would've loved it. 
 And what's important to me is that, if we were to scatter her ashes here, that, every time we came here, we would remember her and Laura would always live on. 
 And, in Sydney, you build whatever you need to build and, whenever you go there, you will remember Laura and, in that way, she lives on. 
 You don't need the remains to build a shrine, right? 
 So, what do you think? 
 Yeah, I can live with that. 
 I like it, love. 
 I really like it as an idea. 
 George is right. 
 I mean, we can have our Laura place and George and Shay and Arlo can have theirs. 
 It makes sense. 
 And I think... I think our girl would be really happy here. 
 Grandma, I know this isn't what you planned and I know that's my fault. 
 But here, this place, this is totally Mum. 
 Don't you agree? 
 I do. 
 I can see that. Mmm. 
 (MUFFLED SPEECH) 
 Oh, Woody! 
 No... 
 Woody... 
 That's so sad! 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Woody and Tracey were kind of here. 
 You can come out now, Woody. 
 So... yep. 
 Sorry, mate. 
 It's just that, when you said the... 
 (WHISPERS) 
 It's OK. 
 When I go, George, I want you to be the one that gives the speech, OK? 
 And I'd like for it to be here, if that's not treading on Laura's toes, so to speak. 
 G'day, mate. I'm Woody. 
 Hi. 
 Tracey. Hi. 
 It's Weld. You get used to it. 
 So, how would you say New Zealand academic standards compares to Australia? 
 The good Australia schools, I'm talking about. 
 Right up there, I'd say. 
 Because, if he's got promise, I mean, real promise, it would be a tragedy if the boy is stuck in a backwater. 
 You get my drift? 
 Drift well and truly got. 
 And there's no danger of that. 
 As far as I'm concerned, Arlo can have any future he chooses. 
 Anna : There you go. 
 The rest will be right out. 
 I think she quite likes you. 
 Uh, this isn't what I ordered. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 It's a Weld thing. 
 Thanks. 
 Oh. 
 Can I tell you something? 
 Certainly, dear. 
 One of the reasons that I couldn't stay in Sydney is I realised I would never be like mum. 
 And I didn't... I didn't want to disappoint you. 
 Shay, I would never want you to be your mother. 
 All I will ever want is for you to be the best you you can be. 
 Whatever that is. 
 Well, what are your plans for when you leave here? 
 I mean, this is a beautiful place, now, in summer, and it's perfect for George to write his columns and what have you, but it's not a place for young people, is it? 
 Not in the long term. 
 It's a pretty cage but... 
 ..it's still a cage. 
 George : When you strip away the emotional baggage the dead bring with them, they exist in the past - gone... 
 But not forgotten. 
 The future, meanwhile, will always be lying in wait. 
 Ready to trip you up at every turn. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hey there. 
 Oh, George. Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I got your message. Thank you. 
 I was gonna call you back but then I... 
 I thought you probably had more important things to think about. 
 It's all sorted. Done and dusted. 
 What a terrible thing to say. 
 Probably. 
 But good on you. 
 Anyway, enough about that. 
 How are you doing? 
 Hey, Fee. 
 Before you kick me out, 'cause I know that's what you're gonna do, I just want to say one thing, OK? 
 You were right to do what you did. 
 I mean, I'm not gonna lie. 
 It hurt at the time. 
 Hurt like hell, in fact. 
 But now I realise it was what I needed to get my life back on track and make things right. 
 And I know you and I are history and that hurts more than anything else. 
 I just hope that, at least, we can reconnect on some level, maybe even be friends. 
 Don't get your hopes up. 
 That's the one I love. 
 Can you just...? 
 Hey, mate. Robert McNamara. 
 People call me Robbie. 
 George Turner. 
 George. 
 Good to meet you, George. 
 Right, who's buying me a drink?
