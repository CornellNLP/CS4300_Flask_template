Sailor Man 
Original air date July 25, 2011 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Man : Hey! [ Horns honking ] 
 Angela : Oh, leave them alone! 
 They're serving our country! 
 Ma, Maura and I are actually the only people who can hear you. 
 Poor boys. They need a little fun. 
 It's Fleet Week. [ Vomiting ] 
 Yeah, poor boys need to learn how to hold their alcohol. 
 God, I can't wait for these guys to be gone in three days. 
 Roosevelt endorsed  the first Fleet Week in 1935. 
 He was intent in expanding the navy. 
 Oh, he's cute. 
 Yeah. Move along. Move along. She's too young for you. 
 Goodbye. [ Chuckles ] 
 I really want to thank you for taking me to brunch. 
 I know you have better things to do on a Sunday morning. 
 Come on. Don't be silly. 
 I mean, what could be more fun. 
 Than taking out your broke, homeless mother, who's been dumped by your father? 
 Ma, stop. Come on. 
 [ Hissing ] Oh! 
 My car is breaking down, too?! 
 It's the only thing in my life that's been working! 
 I'm sure it's fine. 
 Or not. 
 Come on, Maura. Big push. 
 We're gonna push? We're gonna push. 
 Oh, good thing I wore my wedges. 
 Uh, it's okay, ma'am. We can push. 
 Oh! 
 All right. Thanks. 
 Thank you. Ooh. He's cute, too. 
 He called me "ma'am." Ma, scoot over. 
 Angela : Do you think they could push us to Gilberti's Garage? 
 It's so close. 
 Female commissioned officers are addressed as "ma'am." 
 It's a sign of respect. 
 "Sir" is a sign of respect. 
 "Ma'am" is for fat, old cat ladies. 
 Are you talking about me? 
 Do you have a cat? 
 No. 
 Thank you. You're welcome, ma'am. 
 See what I mean? 
 No. 
 Hello? Yeah, hang on. 
 Angela : Giovanni? 
 Hey! [ Chuckles ] Where's your father? 
 Ah, he's down in Florida. No, no, I'll get grease on you. 
 Oh, it's okay! Wow. Look at his shoulder-to-hip ratio. 
 Lengthy metacarpals-- you know what that means. 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 Hey. How you doin'? 
 Great. You look hot as ever. 
 Doesn't she? 
 Ah, your ma -- nicest lady on the block. 
 I swear to God, I'll never forget your chocolate-chip cookies. 
 Oh. [ Chuckles ] Come on. 
 This is my friend Dr. isles. 
 You can call me "Maura." I-I don't mind a little grease. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Uh, what's, you know, a little grease between friends? 
 Ma's car died. 
 It sounds to me like the water-pump bearing. 
 Look at you, all "My Cousin Vinny." 
 [ Laughs ] Love that. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 He's hot. It's hot? 
 Uh, the -- the car. It's -- it's running hot. 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. You're losing some coolant here. 
 You were always so handy. W-wasn't he, Jane? Ma, stop. 
 And taking over for your father like this-- that's a good son. 
 Right, Jane? 
 Good sons make good... 
 Good mechanics, ma? 
 [ Cellphone rings ] 
 Rizzoli. 
 Looks like more than just a pump. Could take a while. 
 Do you think I could get the friends-and-family discount? 
 [ Cellphone vibrates ] 
 You got it, Mrs. Rizzoli. Oh! 
 Thank you! 
 Oh. , we have to leave. 
 Um, I wish I could stay and help you pull the front cover. 
 Let's go. How? 
 We don't have a car. We'll take a taxi. 
 We are not going to the crime scene. 
 We are going home. Since you're a gearhead like me, take Julietta. Oh! Restored her myself. I would love that! N-- uh... Cool! I would love that. 1975 was a great year. No. Stay away from Giovanni. "No"? Oh, this is a 'dibs' thing. "A dibs thing"? Really? Okay, tell me what you have in common with him. All right, he's a blue-collar... [ Parking brake clicks, engine shuts off ] Boston-Italian auto mechanic. Well, so are you. Well, except for being an auto mechanic. And we're best friends. Yes, but I'm interesting. And you don't want to sleep with me. Do you? No. No! But that's my point. That's all I want to do with Giovanni. I just don't really think. You have the patience for Giovanni's type. Well, what's his type? Fun... Till he starts to talk. Sweet. Where'd you get that Alfa? "Lookin' hot." What do we got? White female, badly beaten-- badly beaten, possibly raped. Brenda Martin, 21 years old, Somerville address. Homeless guy looking for bottles found her. [ Camera shutter clicks ] Initial external examination. Indicates likely sexual assault. Navy issue. She was wearing it. There's a blond hair inside. Navy? We got thousands of sailors in town. Only time I envied sailors -- Fleet Week. Don't they have  Marine  Week? Do now. Didn't then. I was gypped. That's a racial slur. Racial slur? Against fortune-tellers? Actually, that's another racial slur. That's odd. What appears to be orange juice on her collar. [ Sniffs ] Now look at her cheek. Face paint -- red, white, and blue. Probably an American flag. Mm. Dust along the handle and door... Please don't tell me she came out of the Dirty Robber. Figures. Swabbies can't even leave us. One little corner during Fleet Week. I'll stand by with the crime-scene techs. Well, I'm coming with you. Why? You are not the boss of me. If I want to go out with Giovanni, I will go out with him. But right now, I-I have to pee. Cute blond girl? There were a bunch of them here. What about one with an American flag painted on her cheek? I was too busy making Fuzzy Navels. Fuzzy Navels? Mm-hmm. Peach schnapps, O.J., lemonade -- chick drink. Sell gallons of it with the navy boys in town. O.J. on her collar. Huh. Well, try to remember. She was 5'2", cute, blond, face paint... Drinking Fuzzy Navels. Mm. Anything ring a bell, slick? Well, now that you put it so nicely, there was one couple. I remember him because he did. That famous sailor kiss with her. The iconic image photographed. By Alfred Eisenstaedt on V-J Day. Yeah, that's the one. [ Chuckles ] Didn't you have an emergency? Yes, I did. Can you describe the guy for us? Well, sure. Young, crew cut, wearing a white uniform. That help you? Not so much. Fractures to the ethmoid, lacrimal, and zygomatic bone. Cause of death? She was strangled. Rape Kit. Positive for semen. Severe vaginal bruising and tearing. So, she was raped. I'll get this to the lab, have them run the profile. Through CODIS and the Department of Defense DNA Registry. That D.O.D. Databank was intended. To identify soldiers' remains, not to find sexual predators. I'd hate to think a navy man would do this. I'm gonna get a burger at that new place on Boylston. You want one? I'll just get a sandwich at the café. I wouldn't. Place is a disaster since Stanley took over. Stanley from the post office? He's got a cousin in personnel. Yeah, I'll help pay to fix her car,  but what are we gonna do about her? She's never worked a day in her life. I have no idea. She took care of us. Okay, I'm not saying that we make her live in a refrigerator box. I'm just saying, you know, she needs to be busy. She needs to do something so she feels good about herself. Oh, she needs a job. Yeah. Stanley : Out of bagels, out of toast. We stop serving breakfast at 8:00. You could use some help telling time, Stanley. Get in line. You gonna stand there, or you gonna order something? Nice customer service. Yeah? Thanks! You could also use some help with the coffee. May I suggest taking your dirty socks out of the coffee pot? You don't like it, go someplace else, Rizzoli. You know -- Don't tick him off. Anthrax came through the postal service. Hey, you know the Fleet Week killer you guys are working? Who's calling him  that? I want in. You want in on my homicide? I need more experience before the detective's exam. I-I'll do grunt work, whatever you want. Huh? [ Groans ] Vomit. I hate carnations! Jane, there you are. Here I am. I, uh-- hey, Frankie. Hey, Giovanni. How you doin'? So, uh, I was wondering -- If I have a boyfriend. Yes. I do. It's -- it's very serious. You do? [ Clears throat ] If you could tell me where to find Maura. Huh? [ Chuckles ] Giovanni, come in. Uh, what are you doing here? How'd you get stuck with all this old stuff? You look hot. Thank you. For you. Oh, uh, I'm the one that owes you. For letting me drive your Alfa. [ Chuckles ] You can keep Julietta as long as you like. Oh, no, I-I couldn't. Um, actually, here you go. Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me. We're just in the middle of a new case. Oh, sure. I'll let you get back to it. Can you give my estimate to Mrs. Rizzoli? I-I'm just charging her for parts. That's very nice of you. [ Chuckles ] I'm not just being nice. I want to take you out. Listen, you like Italian? I love Italians. [ Chuckles ] Italian. Northern Italian. Southern, too. And the food. [ Chuckles ] Let me take you to dinner. Oh, it would be faster if you come to my house. Faster? For me. For me. Because I work really long hours. Yeah. I love hot women who can cook. Okay. [ Chuckles ] Oh, nice. This guy. Ugh! Ooh. [ Chuckles ] God. Uh, Sergeant Korsak, there was a match. On t DNA semen that we found in the victim. I'm afraid it is a sailor. Yes, ma'am, I-I met her at the bar, but I did not do that. What did you do? We partied, but... You partied? Meaning what? We had s*x, sir. You just met her. Look, I know how this sounds, ma'am, but I did not hurt her. I liked her. [ Cellphone vibrates ] She was nice. D.A. wants him held on an aggravated-rape charge. [ Scoffs ] Wait, but -- but I didn't do it. Loo-- my ship is gonna leave. We cooperated with your questioning. But if you think the navy's just gonna give you this sailor-- it's not up to the navy. This is outside of military jurisdiction. Let's go, sailor. Detective Frost. I have a navy admiral here to see you. I got this, sergeant detective. Dad, what are you doing here? I'm here for the immediate release. Of Petty Officer Salerno. Yeah, nice to see you, too. And to inform you that your superiors. Must exonerate the United States Navy. From involvement in these unfortunate events. You see this badge? It's a detective's badge. But right now, this badge outranks your star. Don't make this personal, son. It's not personal. Need I remind you... Fleet Week is a very lucrative endeavor. It'll be a great loss to your city. If it were to be held elsewhere. I'm pretty sure we'll manage that loss, sir. [ Sighs ] It's too bad we couldn't settle this like men. [ Door closes ] [ Blues music playing ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Are we the oldest people here? [ Chuckles ] From the two gentlemen at the bar. My hand hurts from waving. What are they, 13? They both have acne. I think the dark-haired one has braces. I'll use the next one to water the plants. No, I don't like to be rude. Is that why you took Giovanni's velveteen box of chocolates? What'd he get you, a stuffed rabbit, too? He's sweet. Ugh! Umbrellas in drinks started in the 1930s. Anything Polynesian was considered wildly exotic. Unlike Giovanni -- wildly dull. Why would you say you'd have dinner with him? Because he has a spectacular torso, and he's giving your mom a great deal on her car repair. Oh. Well, in that case, play with him all you like. [ Door opens ] [ Chuckles ] Hey, Jane. We got a second rape victim. Korsak says same m.O. Salerno's in lockup. Not anymore, he's not. Admiral Frost bailed him out two hours ago. Admiral Frost? You sure it's Frost's father? Yeah. Well, Frost got a lot of juice to get bail on a murder suspect. This rape is on him. Janey. [ Clears throat ] What do we got? Frost : Dog walker found her. You all right? We got a sailor raping women. Frost, it's not your fault. My father sprung him, Jane. It's on me. Come on. Man : Pulse is weak and thready. She's still alive. Paramedic went to pronounce her, found a pulse. She was dumped here. You find any personal belongings? Nothing. Swept the area. Look what he left behind. Piece of a blue surgical bootie, which mean.. He was all about making sure. He didn't leave behind any footprints or DNA. Second victim's the same M.O. -- white, petite, 20-something. If it's Salerno, he's a serial rapist and a murderer. Maura : She's lucky to be alive. Near-freezing temperature of the mud. Reduced brain swelling, saved her life. What kind of life, though? Too soon to know. Thanks. [ Siren wailing in distance ] [ Backup alarm beeping  ] [ Monitor beeping ] Did you do a rape Kit yet? Yes. Injuries are consistent with a violent rape, but there's no evidence of semen. So, this time, he wore a condom. God, she looks bad. The MRI shows bleeding on her brain. It's not looking good. Did you see this? What is that? Looks like some kind of an abrasion on the skin. Left by an impression. Impression of what? I'd have to do comparison testing. Looks like a zipper, Maura. [ Camera shutter clicking ] Can you hear me? My name is Detective Jane Rizzoli. You're in the hospital. You're safe. And we're gonna keep you safe, and we're gonna find who did this to you. [ Breathing deeply ] Hey, sweetie. Mm. What's your name? Can you tell me your name? It's dark. Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. You're safe. You're safe. No. Stop. Dolphins. All the dolphins. It's okay, baby. Nobody's gonna hurt you here. Blue light. I see blue. Blue light. [ Breathing deeply ] Why? What do you think? I think it's a matter of time, Jane. [ Cellphone vibrates ] We've got to find Salerno. I don't want any more of these girls. "Homey, I need a boner." What?! [ Chuckles ] Spelling errata. Your mother really should proof-read. It's "honey, I need a loaner." Where's her car, Maura. Until Giovanni fixes it, I'm her own personal chauffeur. Well, he's doing it at cost, Jane. He's doing it to get laid, Maura. Oh. Okay, it'll be ready tomorrow. [ Chuckles ] Man: Hey, ladies, you want one? [ Cellphone rings ] No, thanks, man. It's Dragon Fire! Free samples. They're great. Rizzoli. Thank you. Don't be rude. Frost : We found Petty Officer Salerno. Oh, that's great, Frost. Not really. He has an alibi for the second victim. How solid? Rock-solid. At least my father had that part right. Salerno was on the ship, locked up in the brig. So, this predator is still out there. I'm having BRIC track every port these ships have been to, cross-reference with NCIC. Good idea. See if there are any reports of any similar rape-murders. Where the ships have docked. Let me know if you get a hit, okay? Okay, on it. All right, bye. Why didn't Frost tell me about his father? We're partners. Well, do you tell him everything? No. Well, yeah. The big stuff. I mean, we're friends. Well, you and Frost are site-specific friends. Okay, so, would we be friends if we didn't work together? We would never see each other if we didn't work together. So, that's a "no." Well, that's a flawed syllogism. You know, like "all rabbits have whiskers. Rabbits are mammals. So all mammals have whiskers." Get it? Never mind. It's gonna rain. Oh, what, now you're the weather lady. No, look at the beacon, okay? Steady red, rain ahead. Steady blue, clear view. That beacon is highly inaccurate. No. Clear view. It's blue. Blue light. That's why she said that. She could see the light from where she was being attacked. Maura, what is that? That's -- it's not a residential neighborhood. That's, uh-- that's hotels, right? Maura : She mentioned a dolphin. There's no Dolphin Hotel. Maybe it's -- it's in a painting or on a menu or something. Not a menu. Most cultures don't eat dolphin. Although Inuits hunt Orcas, which is a type of dolphin. I'm not suggesting we're looking for a place that serves flipper. I'm saying maybe there's a dolphin in the logo. Yeah. That's it, Jane. Look. Sea Harbor Hotel has a dolphin. I'll get Korsak. Man : You can see the beacon from this floor on up. This side of the building only? Yes. Any women registered on the floor? Three, all single occupants. Are you sure your victim was one of our guests? Well, if she was, we'll know when we see her room. Was this room cleaned this morning? We don't send housekeeping in. When there's a request for privacy. Would you open the door, please? Yeah. [ Beeps ] Jane : She was probably raped here. He's careful, though. I bet we don't find much forensic evidence. Bet we don't find anything. Probably lying in wait, attacked her, pinned her to the bed, raped her. Wearing gloves, booties, and a condom. Got a name. Kim Tretorn, 24. Sales rep for a software company in Minneapolis. Welcome to Boston. I'll call the crime-scene response unit. And get them in here. Korsak : Kim Tretorn. She was in town to meet with vendors. She had dinner with one at the hotel at 7:00. Yeah. Here she is going back to her room alone at 8:04. They got cameras in the lobby, all the elevators, and the emergency exits, but not in the hallways. Jane : Okay, so she gets on the elevator. Nobody follows her in there. And we have her here a minute later. Getting off on her floor. I've been through every bit of this security tape-- stairs, elevator, lobby. She doesn't leave the hotel. Well, she got out of the building somehow, because our dog walker found her three hours later. Almost beaten to death. I'm telling you, she didn't leave. Her room faces Stanhope Street. Someone would've noticed if she rappelled down from the 36th floor. 
 
 [ Cellphone rings ] It's the hospital. Detective Jane Rizzoli. Okay, thank you. [ Cellphone beeps ] Our second victim, Kim, just died. I'm sorry I didn't have time to cook. Uh, mussels posillipo, beef carpaccio with a black-truffle oil, and fettuccine alla grappa with organic baby tomatoes. Mm. You don't like this? I don't like little tomatoes. We can pick them off. My ma makes the best plain spaghetti with butter. Let's have a glass of wine instead. You got any beer? Yes. [ Refrigerator opens ] Here you go. Let's get comfortable. [ Bottle cap clatters ] [ Gulping ] Ah. [ Burps ] Hey, you see the new shortstop hit for the cycle? I didn't. No. [ Chuckles ] I was noticing your necklace. Yeah. Wards off the friggin' malochia. Oh. Uh, the evil eye. Of course. I'll get you one. Thank you. It's, um... No, thank you. Okay. You look hot. Smell hot, too. [ Chuckles ] Thank you. I love talking to you. I could talk to you all night. But right now, babe, all I want to do... Is get you naked and lick your face. Lick my face? Come to daddy. [ Inhales sharply ] What's the matter? I'm sorry. I -- I feel a little nauseated. Whoa! Don't barf on me. This is a new shirt. Oh. Hey, hey, I'm sorry. Go -- go ahead. I bet even your -- even your barf's cute, too. [ Sighs ] Go through it again. Jane. [ Key clacks ] [ Key clacks ] The victim enters here, gets on the elevator here. And we watch the elevator lights again. Hey, Doc, you're working late. Hey. Giovanni notice anything other than your cleavage? Uh, Jane, he wanted to lick my face. I'm so surprised. You mean he didn't take you to see the Boston Pops. And then for a four-course prix fixe at L'Espalier? No. No, he likes plain spaghetti. I just wanted to sleep with him. If only he didn't talk. Or have a face-licking fetish? [ Scoffs ] He keeps texting and leaving messages. He put my picture up on his Facebook page. How do I get rid of him? Tell him the truth. I can't. He's -- he's sweet. [ Chuckles ] Well, then go have little Giovannis with him. Just make sure you can genetically alter them. So they don't lick... Or talk. Korsak : Mmm. Smells great. Boy, my blood sugar's plummeting. Well, help yourself. You find anything? No. There's nothing on these tapes. Let's look at the lobby again. [ Key clacks ] Wait. Go back. [ Key clacks ] Who is this guy? Does the navy stay at the hotels? No, sailors all sleep on their ships. Same with the officers. So, who's this guy with the suitcase? He's an officer. He keeps turning his head. It's like he knows where the cameras are. Frost, push in on the suitcase. [ Key clacks ] Maura : Look at the wheels. He's having trouble getting it over the metal door jamb. Because he's pulling a heavy load. Yeah, 107 pounds of Kim Tretorn. So he rapes her, he beats her unconscious, and then he gets her out stuffed in that suitcase. One hell of a ballsy move. Maura, that Mark on her face-- would that match the zipper from the suitcase? [ Keys clacking ] Those marks are consistent with that type of a zipper. That's as good as finding the murder weapon. We find that suitcase, we can match the zipper impression. To the one on her face. Jane, look at this. He tips his hat to the maid, cool as a cucumber. He's had a lot of practice. We are looking for a naval officer. That's a serial rapist and a murderer. It's gonna be a long night. Just got this from NCIC. Three hits -- similar rape-murders, all in the last year. Same M.O. -- 20s, petite. Look at the locations. New Orleans, Indianapolis, Houston. Ships don't go to Indianapolis or Houston. Murders aren't connected. Unless he's not our guy. We haven't had a rape-murder all year, then two in a row while thousands of sailors are in town? It's a sailor. I've been staring at him all night. Take a break, Frost. Can't. We got to get him. Got less than a day before those ships sail. Your father -- you knew he was here. The ship's here, he's here. And you weren't gonna see him? Hey, he knew how to find me when he needed something. He gave me one like this... The day we moved to Japan. Dragged me and my mom all the way out there, then took a commission on a ship. Two years went by. Before she gave up, came back to Boston. I'm sorry. You know, seemed to me he was here to see you. He could have just asked me to spring Salerno. [ Chuckles ] He wasn't asking. He was ordering. He came here to do what he always does-- serve the navy. But turns out he wasn't wrong, Frost. Salerno was not our guy. You know what, Korsak? [ Exhales sharply ] Why don't you spend your time working on this case. Instead of defending somebody that you don't even know? Hey, I'm sorry. I got work to do. I shouldn't have stuck my nose in. Probably not, no. Just-- just give him some time. [ Coffee pouring ] God, I want to get this b*st*rd, Korsak. Hello, Stanley. Try the coffee. Made it special for you. Really? Yeah. Put my underwear in it today. Angela : Morning, sweetheart. Sergeant. Isn't it a lovely day? What are you doing here, ma? I'm going to work. I've got that car-repair bill to pay. You're late, Rizzoli, on your first day. I'm really sorry, Mr. Stanley. It'll never happen again. I was having some car trouble and-- yes, look, save it for someone who cares. Here. Hair net. Oh. [ Sneezes ] Oh, my God. I'm gonna arrest him for a health-code felony. Ma, you can't work for Mr. Stanley. Hey, lady. What's your problem? My problem is you. There's a line here. I see that. Try the coffee. What are you doing? Don't cut the line, ma'am. Did you just call me "ma'am"? You gonna yammer or help my customers? Yeah! I'm so sorry. What can I do for you? I would like to pay for this. There you are. I need your help. Well, I like your bear. Did Giovanni win that for you at the carnival? It's not funny. Okay, he seems to be under some impression. That we are in a relationship. Well, tell him that you were only interested. In sleeping with him, and then you became uninterested. When he tried to be a person and have a conversation. He says he's waiting on special parts for your mother's car. Okay. Yeah. What if he means my parts? I don't think this is police business. Oh, gosh. All right, look, the next time I tell you don't, don't, okay? Go do the second autopsy. I have an idea. Really? Yeah. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. [ Spits ] It's a small fiber -- synthetic. Nylon, you think? Could be. From the suspect's roller bag, maybe. I'll take it to fiber analysis. Giovanni. You look hot. Hey, I left you a bunch of messages. You, uh -- did you get the bear? Isn't it interesting what Dr. isles does for a living? She dissects dead bodies. [ Saw whirring ] Believe me, all right? This-- this part you don't want to see. Oh, man! This is wicked. It's like "Dawn of the Dead" in here. I mean, it's better than zombies. This is great. No, no, no, no. I want to watch this. Hey, you look great with the saw. Seriously. They make you crease your trousers in the marines, Korsak? Yeah, 'course, razor-sharp. Look at this. [ Mouse clicks ] No creases. Can you get closer on his commendation bars? [ Mouse clicks ] They're out of order. And that one's from Vietnam. The uniform's a fake. Good work, Frost. I'm gonna check the costume houses in town. Lots of bars and restaurants. Are making their employees put on sailor outfits. I'll update Jane. Is he gone? Not really. He's kind of like a bedbug. Hard to eradicate. Yes! Anything on the fiber you found on the victim? It's heavy-duty ripstop nylon, used in the manufacturing of suitcases. So we're looking for a navy-blue rolling bag. In a city of tourists. Well, at least you've ruled out 5,000 sailors. Yeah, we just have to find someone posing as one. Oh. Hey, Jane. Is that ma's chicken pot pie? She wanted Maura to try it. How sweet. Thank you. It was you! You got her the job in the café. She needed a job. He needed an assistant. With Stan-Illa the hun?! Really, Frankie?! Mmm! This is delicious, Jane. Yeah, I know. She's a really good cook. Oh. Have a bite. Mmm. [ Can opens ] Mmm. There's 27 grams of sugar in that. It's good enough for the navy. Sailors were handing 'em out. That's it. Hmm? I thought it was odd that a sailor was handing out samples. Give me that. Here. Here it is. Street promos. Dragon Fire energy drinks and other companies hire them. To hand out samples, drum up interest. Yeah, look at that. They work big events all over the country. See if they've been in new Orleans, Indianapolis, and Houston. Right. The NCIC hits. Yeah. Hey, maybe our guy works for this company. Could be. Thank God kids need to post their damn lives. Yeah, but now we've got to figure out. If one of these guys is our killer. Got him. His name is Devon Bosco. He lives in Cincinnati. He travels with street promos. Corporate office just confirmed he was the only employee. Who worked all three of the cities. Got a driver's license. You're not going. Come on. Korsak? It's your call. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You kids work it out. I'll see you in the car. You're not in uniform. You're not on the clock. If you come, you hang back.
