 Anchor (on TV) :  What a perfect day for the Massachusetts Marathon. 
 Now, we've got our own race correspondent ready to tell us... ...all about this 26.2- mile race. Tom, what's the mood there? There's a tremendous amount of excitement right now. The streets are packed with spectators on both sides. The runners are still loosening up, getting ready for the race. I had the chance to talk with the police a short time ago. They said they expect about 400,000 people are gonna be lining the race. They're gonna be watching as some 38,000 registered runners go by. So it's gonna be crazy. It's gonna be a great day out here. [ALL CHEERING] Tom : There's hundreds of thousands of people watching. They have family and friends here cheering, supporting them... ... expecting them to cross the finish line. After you train, you wanna take part... You seen Maura? Janie, there's 400,000 people here. I said, inside the Dirty Robber. How did you get in? I thought you had to qualify. They don't check the times of people over 75. Hello, Vanilla. Hey, 5-0 bro. What up, Rondo? You know each other? I arrested him. Bogus. Look, got me some tips for you. I heard you need a good CI. Go away. Damn, you looking fine today. You don't wanna go running, you wanna cut out with Rondo. Got something to make you feel good. Oh, yeah? Yeah. The ladies love this flavor. Ha, ha. Okay, get out of here, bro. All right. Go ahead, go ahead. Hey, Vanilla. You need any help, you come find Rondo. Okay, Casanova. All right, go ahead, Rondo. Rondo : Yeah. Frankie : Keep walking. Thank you. You're welcome. Really, why are you doing this? I thought you hated running. Because I told my friend I would. Your friend? [SHOES SQUEAKING] Oh, hi. Sorry I'm late. Heh. Still getting used to these. You didn't tell me we were running as mallard ducks. I haven't built up my foot muscles to the point where I could run barefoot. We'll chip in and buy you some shoes. Early humans ran very comfortably without shoes. Research has proven that the barefoot strike pattern is much less stressful. You, talking Google, stressful. Where's your matching outfit? We're running for a charity. Professionals for Underprivileged Kids Of Excellence. We're a team. Team Puke? Yes, that is an unfortunate acronym. At least you're not a hotdog. Or a mustard. Stay out of this. Look, I said that I would do this because we wanted to do something together. But I am not running like Lady Puke Gaga. No. Oh. I'm sorry. I should've realized. I didn't... I'm sorry. Holy crap, you're not gonna cry on me. No, I'm trying not to. My amygdala and my lacrimal gland have a connection that I can't control. Honey, there is no way in hell I am taking this off. I'm already running 26 miles with a camel toe. Oh! Okay, can you at least take off that baggy T? Come on, I'll let you walk up Heartbreak Hill. Oh, I'm walking Heartbreak. Okay, you have to do better than that. Okay, fine. Name it. Next reddish-brown stain, you call blood, before the labs come in. You want me to lie? No, I want you to state the obvious. [MAURA SIGHS] Hypothetically, based on the crime scene... ...I will determine whether it is possible to hypothesize that a stain is blood. I'll take that. Twenty bucks says you crap out... by mile 10. You're on, bet. And double or nothing, I run like this. Frankie : Okay. I have some footskins for you too. Don't push it. Okay. You know, my feet are hurting... so I think I'm gonna take mine off anyway. Anchor :  The race has started for elite runners. But here we go about to start our first wave of amateur runners. Here's Tom Martin. Tom :  You're absolutely right. You excited? Ecstatic. You will be. Runner's high kicks in around mile 12. Endorphins are comparable to orgasm. People are already sweating on me. [CROWD CHEERING] Anchor :  And they're off. [ALL CHEERING AND SHOUTING] Tom :  There's a lot of family and friends here. College students are here. They brought their grills, picnic lunches, that type of thing. There's a tremendous amount of support and enthusiasm for everybody... ...taking part in this race. Angela : Oh, your son is running. My daughter is running. She's a police officer. Hi guys. How are you doing? Hey. We're the Rizzolis. I'm Angela and this is Frank. What's up, bro. I'm not your brother, bro. [ANGELA LAUGHS] All right, lighten up, Frank. Come on. Janie's running, Frankie's working. Everybody's having fun. I mean, we're all families out here. I'd rather hang out with your mother. Okay, that's not nice. It's not a good way to start the day, okay? Tom :  Now these folks are clearly running enthusiasts, not professionals. We're gonna see how enthusiastic they are... ...when they struggle to the top of Heartbreak Hill. [JANE SIGHS] Cramp? Blister. My right heel is killing me. Too much heel. Your forefoot should absorb the shock. Strike, forefoot, toes. Strike, forefoot, toes. Strike... That's enough, dog whisperer. That's it. Great stride. Runner down. Really, really down. I repeat, there's a runner down. What happened? He started zigzagging, then he dropped. Heat stroke maybe? No, ma'am, don't touch him. She's a doctor. This isn't heat stroke. No pulse. Heart attack? Blood. Yep, it's blood. Absolutely not a reddish brown stain. Maura, this doesn't count. Come here. Look, look. I see it. This was so not in my training seminar. It's an entrance wound. He was shot. Shock. He just bit his tongue. She said he's been shot. No, no. Help, there is a runner... All right, you don't talk, or call or e-mail or text anybody, okay? It's my duty to alert the authorities. I am the authorities. Not mine. I'm responsible for miles 3 to 5... Oh. You're Buffalo Scout? Yeah, so it's in your honor to be loyal, and helpful and obedient. Hear that? Obedient, okay? Get a stretcher and some oxygen now. Maura : Why oxygen? You do anything with that mouth besides breathe, bad things will happen. Okay? Go. Take his pulse. He's dead. Maura, help. You want me to pretend he's alive? No. I'm not gonna be an accessory to lying. Oops! Sorry. And there goes our crime scene. Anchor :  There are hundreds of doctors and medical workers... ...in tents throughout the race to take care of any emergencies. I guess, with 38,000 runners, you're going to see hundreds of problems. Tom? Yes, no doubt, Sam. As the race goes on, we're gonna get more and more problems... Put that right there. Maura, help. No. We get the officials to stop the race, follow protocol... and we have a chance of solving this. Listen to me, we do have a chance. He is our evidence. I don't understand. What happens when 250,000 people who are crammed like sardines... find out there's a shooter on the loose? Mass panic, 346 pilgrims were trampled to death... during a ritual at Ramy Al-Jamarat because somebody panicked. Exactly. So you've gotta Ramy ala-Jim Jam right here. Want that? No, but I don't want anybody getting gunned down. We can stop that, but I can guarantee people... or gonna get trampled to death if we don't contain this right now. Now help me. [KORSAK LAUGHS THEN DOG WHIMPERS] Korsak : Get it, get it. What is that? [KORSAK LAUGHS] Aw. [BARKS] Oh. Get it. Oop! [LAUGHS] Yeah. [PHONE RINGS] Homicide, Korsak speaking. Hey, Korsak, it's me. You're not even out of breath. I'm not running. You've been talking about the marathon for weeks. Korsak, we got a shooting victim, okay? White male, 30s. No ID. Where are you? We got him in an EMS vehicle. But we're not moving. We're boxed in around Mile 3. On the radio? Press will get wind... we'll have a stampede. No, no, no. No one knows. Sorry, did you pinch the shooter? No. What's the matter? Get to BRIC. Fire up every security camera in the city. We got a shooter in the marathon. I was about a thousand yards when he went down. Didn't hear the shot. Nobody did. Silencer? Yeah, it has to be. Terrorist attack? No, it doesn't fit the profile. He's not an elite runner, and the area's too residential. They'd want more bang for the buck. Big crowd, big casualties. Start or finish line. The sniper doesn't make sense either. Tracking down one amateur runner? You're guessing. I'm making a conclusion... based on years of experience and training. Can you see the entrance wound? Yeah, looks like a close contact wound. No, I'll verify that when I do my autopsy. Shh! We got people running for four hours. We can't stop the race. There's no way to safely evacuate half a million panicking people. Remember the 60,000 kids that got rambunctious after the Sox Game? One dead, 16 injured. Yeah. And that was with a thousand riot police. Korsak, we're not moving. You have to work it from there. Can you get Dr. Isles on board? Yeah, she's not going anywhere. I'll run interference with the brass, buy time. Okay, buddy, thanks. Where's the nearest medical tent? Not far. Why? We need some... muckety-muck race official. Um, who's in charge? Ron Garvey. But you can't talk to him. He's busy. He's gonna be a lot busier if he doesn't help us. Get him. Get him. Come in. Hey, Vince, what's going on? First homicide in the history of the Massachusetts Marathon, a shooting. Oh, no. We get the shooter? No, Rizzoli was first on scene with Dr. Isles. Rizzoli's kept a lid on it. Okay. She's a pain, but a great cop. It was a lucky break having a medical examiner there. All right, so we got the Charles Street Bridge closed down. Mass Avenue Bridge, BU Bridge, all closed. Every street from here to Newton. City's crammed with people with no way out. If we try to stop the race, we're gonna have mass panic. I gotta try to figure a way to evacuate all these people. Mobilize other counties, National Guard. You been brass too long, Sean. It'll take them hours. Even if they get here, we'll have rioting and looting. Right now, we got one homicide. Okay. I'll fill in the commissioner and the governor. You think you can convince a bunch of politicians to do the right thing? I'm gonna try. We're about an hour into the race, Tom. Any signs of fatigue? At this point, so far, so good. We've had a couple of sprains, some dehydration... couple cases of heat stroke, but nothing more serious than that. Although earlier, we did get a report of a guy down... at mile marker three with chest pains. Jane : Give us some room. Nobody comes in this tent. I just need to know that I'm able to trust you with the situation. My job is situations. Anybody wanna tell me about this heart attack VIP? Yeah, our heart attack VIP is a gunshot DOA. All right. I need to call the governor. Need to run our contingency plans. You have a plan for random shootings? While you are figuring that out, Maura, what do we got? Maura : Help me get his shirt off. Okay. The bullet hit his heart. Explains why the blood rushed... when I compressed his chest. Can you run his number? I need a name. I need a coroner's van. Gotta get this body to a morgue immediately. Maura, you're gonna have to do this here in the field. [LAUGHS] You're kidding, right? Ha, ha. This body's evidence. Maura, we sat in the ambulance and didn't move, so... you're gonna spend the next six hours... crawling back to the lab while our killer slips away? I mean, come on... Jane... Okay, sure, Jane. Give me a Leatherman and duct tape and I'm good to go. Great, I got those both here. See? Okay, so... Autopsy table and look. Scrubs. What else do you need? Maura : How about an ultrasound? Done. Eagle Boy, can you hack into a computer? I took one apart in scouts. Close enough. I gotta get online with Korsak and Frost. We got you, Jane. We're plugged in. Jane (over computer) :  Who knows? I've briefed the commander. He gonna let me handle on the ground? I'll run interference. What do you got? I don't know. Uh, vic's name is Damon Ward. He's 33 years old. I'm running him. Guys, we got thousands of witnesses, okay? Nobody sees a gun, hears a shot, no casings at the scene. What is this? Shot alert picked up audibles at 9:00, 9:32 and 10:00. That was the starter pistol. The race starts in heats. Could it have been a random stray bullet? It's happened before. Dennis Rainear, um, got hit by a stray in 1978. He ran the last 16 miles of the Grand Valley marathon... with a bullet lodged in his head. Of course you would know that. Guys, look. If the shot alert didn't get a stray, we could be dealing with a silencer here. Which would mean a pro. A sniper up in a window or on a rooftop. We activate SWAT, we've got another problem, like panic. I don't think this shot came from a roof. Jane, come and see. Take us with you on the computer, if you can. Jane : Yeah. Observe the wound track. The bullet traveled to the ribs... collapsed the right lung, pierced the heart, kept going... embedded itself under the left armpit. Let me see the wound. Confirms our theory, Jane. It's not a sniper or a terrorist. That is a point-blank kill shot. Stippling pattern reminds me of the old lady's crack wars. So, what does that mean? Maura : It means he was shot point-blank while he was moving. The killer was running in the race. Jane : Frost, we're sending photos of the victim. We need to find out who wanted this guy dead. Anchor :  We've got an especially strong men's field. Runners from Ethiopia, three from Kenya. They're setting a blistering pace. We may even see a new record set today. Tom? Well, actually, Sam, we may. Keep in mind, the elite runners in this race... want to finish in two hours and five minutes or less. That means that all of the best runners in this race are... Garvey : Nothing's leaked to the media. The governor just got back to me... and just got off the phone with your commissioner... and gonna let you be point on this, for now. Maybe I'll vote for him next time. Here's our victim. Damon Ward, 33. Boston-area native all the way through high school. Lives in New Mexico. What was he doing? Flew in two days ago to run. Some homecoming. Our victim's a living lawsuit. Guy don't have fans nowhere. Ran some shady adjustable mortgage scam, took people's homes. Maybe one of them took him out. Run every name from every lawsuit. See if anybody is registered to run this race. Look, this is all very good news, okay? We got a means, motive, opportunity. Looks like an old-fashioned murder, so I have a feeling we'll find our killer. Great. These are very sophisticated tools... ...I don't miss my lab at all. Is that sarcasm? I think so. Well, heads up. This might get messy, people. Am I free to go, detective? Because I don't think this is good for me. Massachusetts general laws chapter 27, section 4H States... Maura : Jane. Yes, Quinn, technically you are free to go. But I don't know why you would, because you got a hell of a cop eye. I do? Better than any scout I've ever seen. She doesn't know any. And... Excuse me. And if you will stay, all right, I got a very important job for you. Quinn : What is it? Jane : Have a seat. It requires an explanation. Yes, ma'am. Let's not get crazy with the "ma'am." I'm not exactly wearing mom jeans here. What's great about this famous race... is just how much fun everyone seems to be having. Tom, I understand you've talked to people who have a loved one in the race. Do they all get to see their runners go by with this many people there? Great question. Because a lot of the runners... I talked to race officials and they say about a third of the 38,000 runners... have a digital chip in their shoe... so family and friends can track progress throughout the race. It really is amazing. There's a lot of ways people... Hey, Frank. Get those sausages going. Those poor boys are starving. [PAGER BEEPS] It looks like I'm the poor boy here. I got another work page. Another 200 banjos down the drain. I don't wanna hear it. All I'm saying is... You're saying you'd rather have your hand up some pipe... than cheer your daughter on? [CROWD CHEERING] Unless my daughter is now Kenyan, you know, I haven't seen much of her. I haven't seen much of my wife, either. Oh, what's that supposed to mean? I'm having fun out here with people. It's the biggest party day of the year. Also the biggest toilet day of the year, next to Thanksgiving. You worked on Thanksgiving. Come on, you serve the bird at 5:00. What's the harm, anyway? Your daughter's not a turkey. Yeah, well, right now, it looks like I am. You use your fingers? Well, she has to. The tool leaves marks. It changes the evidence. Wow. Nine millimeter. Anything on it? I can't tell. It's not exactly a SEM scope. And I thought I was negative. Hand me that baggie. Yeah. Okay, I'll get this to Korsak for testing. Maura : I thought you said nobody could get anywhere. You. You volunteer at marathons. You run? Yes, ma'am. Sir. Uh, detective. My best time in the 800 is... Raise your hand. The other hand. I hereby deputize you specifically to run this bullet to Detective Korsak... in the Boston homicide unit without speaking to anyone. Got it? Please go. [CROWD CHEERING] What happened here? Anybody see what happened? Sir? Anybody see what happened to him? Sir, can you hear me? This is officer Frank Rizzoli. I'm gonna need an EMT at mile 12. Frost : I got you, Frankie. I got a runner down. White male, approximately mid-30s, no pulse, no sign of injury. Korsak :  Turn to channel 4. Copy that. Frost :  We need to talk to Jane. 
 
 Rizzoli. Yeah? Garvey : Get over here. They need you on the computer. Frankie's calling in from the ground. Please, tell me he's okay. He's fine, but another runner just went down at mile 12. My God. I gotta call the governor. Frankie :  I repeat, we got a runner down. I need a little help here. This is bad. Frankie :  Yeah, I'm gonna need a little help here. Got off the phone with the commissioner who got the phone with the governor. Sean... Don't say a word. The commissioner tells me we got a second shooting. I hear it from him like I'm standing around. I'm sorry... Be sorry when you're counting pencils. What the hell, Vince? So, what did you say? I said something stupid. I just gave my word that my team will get this done. You know how far out on a limb I am on this? Any idea what I'm putting on the line? Yeah, I do. We got this. Well, you better. Or we'll both be counting pencils. Frost : Uniform brought in this kid. He's got an evidence bag with a bullet in it and he won't let go of it. Are you Quinn? Is that the bullet from the first victim? How many are there? Please don't tell Detective Rizzoli I talked. Give me the bullet, kid. Talk to me. She said that if I talked, bad things would happen. You're safe. I'd rather go home. Sit down till I say you can go. Okay. The only one you talk to is him or me. You got it? Korsak : You know what kind of merit badge you'll get for this, kid? Man : Open up. Frankie : All right, in here. Put him on the table. There? Yep. Okay, all right, one, two, three. What in the hell's going on here? Got two runners murdered, don't know why and the killer is running in the race. And you didn't tell me this? I couldn't, okay? I had to keep it off the radios. Jane, Ma and Pop are in the middle of it. I know that. There are a lot of ma's and pops out there. All right. Okay, you're right. So, what do you have? Nothing solid. Ah. I'll do what I can. I know. Garvey : Just got off the phone. He wants to engage the guard and shut this thing down. Jane : He can't do that. You're gonna create panic and multiple casualties. There is a serial killer loose, a terrorist. We need to get people off the streets. Okay, just look. Both these guys have the exact same close-contact entrance wounds, okay? That means same shooter. Out of all of these people, our two victims... Two white guys about the same age, all right? There's a connection here. There's not some random shooting. These guys are being targeted. A theory. We are shutting this thing down. Hey, hey, hey. Look, I need you to man up here, okay? Or you're gonna have your big disaster. Mass panic. The shooter's gonna slip away in the chaos... and you have people trampled to death. Give me a little time, let me figure out the connection. I will find the killer. All I can do is try to advocate for normal operations to continue. Tell the governor we got things handled here. All right, if this thing blows up, bomb's in your hands. Wouldn't be the first time. Wow, picking a fight with the governor. You're fearless. No, I'm not. Come on, we should stop the race. We stop this race... we send a message to thousands of people that we give in to fear. We don't give in to fear. Okay, I understand. If we do, then we just end up dying a little bit every day. Which, metabolically speaking, we do, anyway. Maura. Really? Come on! [CROWD CHEERING] There's Mike. Yay, Mike. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Jane, where are you? Are you close? Jane :  Uh, no, Ma, I'm not. I got a bad cramp, okay? So you and pop should just go home. We've been here for hours. Your father's gonna be furious. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disappoint you. Yeah, well, that's disappointing. What'd she say? She's not running. She cramped out. Crapped out? Janie? No, cramps. She's not in the race. Unbelievable. What are you doing? I'm packing up. Why? Why? Janie's not running. We're out. I don't wanna go home. I can see why, you know. You're the life of the party. And, uh, you're the party pooper. Well, I wasn't exactly getting an invitation, do you know what I mean? What are you talking about? We've been out here for five hours... the only words you said to me... was " fire up the barbecue and open up some beers." I feel like I work for you. If I work, I wanna go and get paid for it. Okay, that's not true. Sure it is. You know, you always talk about family and being together. You know, I'm right here, Angela. I'm right here. And you're spending the whole day swapping chicken parm recipes all day. I'm sorry, Frank. I wanna be here with you. Come on. Come here. Yeah, who could tell? Oh, you baby. [ANGELA CHUCKLES] Can you ID the bullet? KORSAK [OVER COMPUTER]:  I think so. We got a witness on the second shooting. Let me talk to him. Bring him in. Vanilla. I was hoping it would be you, baby. Damn. Them shorts is slamming. Man, what you doing up in here? Rondo, just tell me what you saw. Oh, I saw it all. Dude was running. Next thing, he fell out. I knew that player was shot. But... That him? Which...? Did you see who shot him? I might have missed that part. My eyes was fixated on this fine freak looking all perfect in her running stuff. But she was no you, but who is, right? So you saw a hot girl running in shorts. You're a hero. Yes, I am. And every hero needs his hottie. Get him out of here. Come on, let's go. The bullet's a 9-millimeter hollow point. Hit man's bullet. Okay. Which is why it looks like... a grenade went off in their chests. Grooves on the slug indicate a silencer. Where'd you learn that? You. I pay attention. Push in more. See, there are synthetic fibers on the bullet. Looks like various polymeric resins. What is that? Pleather. Come here. The gunshot trajectory along with the fibers found on the bullet... suggests that our suspect... was shooting from here. That's it. That's it. The suspect is shooting from a fanny pack. That explains the pleather, explains why nobody saw anything. Frost :  Jane. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Our two victims went to high school together right outside Boston. Frost : Whoa. We got something big. Both their names popped up on an old criminal case. What kind of case? Don't know, it's sealed. File's in the courthouse. Damn it. A court order will take hours, if we get a judge. I got an idea. What, you gonna break in? Yes, I am. You in yet? You mean since you asked 30 seconds ago? Ah. Here it is. State of Massachusetts v. Ward and Walker. Open it. Good idea, Korsak. Abracadabra. Oh, your way didn't work. Tell Rizzoli you can't do it. Jane, our two victims raped a 15-year-old girl back in 1995. Samantha Brown. They did a rape kit and serology. Where are the results? Oh, God. Jane, look at this. The monsters beat her. Seems like a solid case. Frost : Oh, man. They videotaped it. Why didn't this go to trial? There's a third defendant, Jim Filmore. Filmore. The Filmore family? It's a very wealthy family. Filmore must have bought off the DA. No one ever got access to the rape footage. You know, part of me wants to let this shooter finish off this asshole. Check the marathon database. See if he's running. Filmore's registered. So our third victim is still in this race. Is Filmore wearing microchip on his shoe? No, only about half of them do it so their families can track them. Wait, uh, he had to qualify, right? So, what if we track him by his time? Hmm. He runs a lot, but he's pretty erratic. Seven-minute mile in Miami, 10 minutes in New York. Maura :  Doesn't narrow it. He could be anywhere from mile 20 to mile 25.5. Twenty five point five? Based on my calculations... Please tell me later. What about Samantha, the rape victim? Is she registered? Not registered. Got a driver's license, though. 800 Chestnut Hill. That's two blocks away. You need backup. No, it'll take too long. It's... I got an idea for backup. This race has run so smoothly today. We're getting reports that the number of injuries is actually lower than last year. Is that right, Tom? Tom :  That's great news. Not only for the city but for the organizers as well. I heard that the worst injury so far is a broken wrist. Somebody stumbled, put their hand out to break their fall. Let's hope that all of the runners still out there eventually cross the finish line. This is not the race I had in mind. Yeah, me neither. Yes? We need to speak to Samantha Brown, please. You can't. She's dead. What? Samantha committed suicide a year ago. If you ask me, she died the day she was raped. We all did. I've seen the case file. Why didn't it ever go to trial? We've been waiting for that answer for 15 years. Is your husband here? No, he's dead of a heart attack. It's just me and my daughter, Courtney. Jane : Can we take a look around? We've got nothing to hide. Excuse me. Excuse... Is she here? Is this her room? Why is it locked? Mother : I don't know. What are you doing? Where's Courtney? Oh, no. Running. In memory of her sister. Jane : Oh, my God. Jane (over radio) :  Frost, do a marathon database search for Courtney Brown. That's him. Yeah, that's Filmore. How we gonna find him in this sea of people? Oh, God. She's my daughter's age. God damned tragedy. Frost : I'm looking at a security camera at mile 20. Mile 21. Korsak : Maybe he's making good time. Dr. Isles calculated he could be all the way to mile 25.5. There. Right there. Damn, Frost, good eye. Frankie, we got him. Mile 25. Frankie (over radio) :  We're two minutes out. Come on, Rizzoli. Korsak : Come on. Frankie : All right, Frost, where they at? Talk me in. Frost :  Middle of the street, maroon running outfit. Can you see him? Frankie : Not yet. Wait. Yeah, yeah. Can you get to him? Frankie :  Jane, about 20 yards ahead. Is he running alone? Yeah, I think so. Not anymore. That's the shooter, right? The girl? Yeah, hope they can get there. Come on, Rizzoli. Hey, Jim. Excuse me? You're making good time. I almost didn't find you. Do I know you? No. But, uh, my sister did. Samantha Brown? I don't know who you're talking about. Sure you do. She was a freshman. You were a senior. You remember homecoming. Where you raped her, along with your two other running buddies. There. Watch out. Come on, Rizzoli. Filmore : You're crazy. That's what you called my sister when they let you walk away. She didn't get to walk away. I don't know what you're talking about. Jane : Courtney, don't do it. Courtney : Wait. One more. [SIGHS] One more. Just one more. Frankie : All right. Courtney : Please! Frankie : Easy. Just let my sister rest in peace. Murder never brings any peace, to the living or the dead. Frankie : Go ahead. I got her. No. No. What happened? She killed Damon and Ray? They did not survive their injuries. Burn in hell with your sister, you crazy bitch. Calm down. Jane. James Filmore, you are under arrest for the rape of Samantha Brown. I guess you know who I am? Yeah, I know who you are. And I know what you did. You gang-raped a 15-year-old girl. Statute of limitations is up. You can't charge me. You're too late. Yeah, you missed one technicality. You raped Samantha when she was 15. Statute says 15 years from the time the victim turns 16. Statute hasn't run out yet. Huh? No. Come here. Yeah. Nobody to pay off this time. Frankie :  We've got the situation secured. Thanks, guys. You're one lucky son of a bitch. You could have told me Rizzoli could run her ass off. Kind of looking forward to counting pencils. This is kind of stressful. Cavanaugh : Yeah, what a day. You did good. You too. Still got your balls. You mean, even though I'm brass? Yeah. Even though you joined the dark side. Thanks, Sean. Hi. Is that the guy you saw? Could be. But I know I seen that fine bitch there before. What did she do? What do you know? Old Rondo saw something. Give me 40 bucks. What for? For finishing the race. You didn't finish the race. I will. And I need a loan. All right. Forty bucks? There you go. Yeah. Thank you. Hey. Next time you see something, you come talk to me, all right? You mean, I am now your confidential informant, Vanilla? [BOTH CHUCKLE] Great plan. Rondo : All right. I'll see you. Frankie : Where you going? Heartbreak Hill. Anchor :  Oh, now all that's left is the cleanup. Big job, Tom. Tom :  The race is finally over. All of the runners have, in some cases, struggled across the finish line. It's a chance to grab a bottle of water, put their feet up, catch their breath. It doesn't look that bad... ... considering we had hundreds of thousands of people in Boston. It was a good day. It was a great race. And I think it's terrific... that we're able to hold huge events like this today in American cities. How's the heel? It's good. I think that runner's high is kicking in. Yeah. Maybe you should run with Garvey next year. Ha! Are you kidding? I'm not the one he wants to chase. You wanna race, huh? I wanna race. I was born to run. Angela : Come on, girls. Whoo! Come on. [ANGELA CHEERS] Oh, man. Baby. Oh! You did it. Great job. Angela : You did it. Great job. Angela : I'm so proud of you. [ALL CHATTERING] Jane : Grab the water bottle. Ride that bike.
