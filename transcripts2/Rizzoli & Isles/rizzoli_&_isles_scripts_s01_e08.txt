 [ Insects chirping ] 
 Jane : Aah! 
 Hoyt : Hey, Jane. 
 Oh, it's okay, baby. 
 Wake up, baby. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 [ Gasps ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Horn honks ] 
 [ Dog barking in distance ] 
 [ Rustling ] 
 [ Cat yowls ] 
 [ Camera shutter clicks ] 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 Maura : Body temp is low. 
 He's been sitting here for a while. 
 Jane : That's today's paper. 
 What, was he reading the stock pages, he slit his own throat? 
 Mm. 
 There's something very odd about the edges of the wound. 
 Well, yeah, the whole thing's odd. 
 I mean, there's no blood. There's no sign of struggle. 
 What? Death by a sharp nap? 
 And the darkening of the nasojugal fold indicates fatigue and vitamin deficiencies. 
 Really? You. 
 You have dark circles under your eyes. 
 Are you not sleeping again? 
 Thank you. You look nice, too. 
 Morning, partner. 
 Hey. 
 What do you got? James Stern. 
 James Stern? Why... why... why do I know that name? 
 James Stern? 
 You know, I do, too. I think he was a missing person? 
 I'll run him. Okay. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You having nightmares again? 
 Yeah, I dreamed I showed up to work in my underwear. 
 Anxiety. 
 You think? 
 Yes, I have this reoccurring dream that I have this biochemistry final, and I haven't studied. 
 Really? Stop. 
 It's terrifying. 
 I can't take any more. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You're right. 
 James Stern and his wife, Emily, vanished two years ago. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 There was a history of domestic violence, and he was the number-one suspect in her disappearance. 
 Theory was he murdered her, hid her body, and fled. 
 That's right. 
 Well, it looks like karma finally caught up to him. 
 Sanskrit word. 
 You know, the cycle of cause and effect. 
 I think it originated in the shramana tradition. 
 Do you  have  to do that? 
 Do what? 
 That... that word thing you do. 
 Etymology? 
 You can't stop, can you? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Not really. 
 Frankie : Hey, Janie? 
 Yeah? 
 You busy later? 
 What, you mean after my relaxing day in the park? 
 No. What do you got? 
 I need to talk to you about mom and dad. 
 Okay, yeah. Sure, Frankie. All right? 
 I'll see you later. 
 Maura, I'll see you at the autopsy. 
 I think mom is saving up to leave dad. 
 Because she's selling anti-aging lychee potion? 
 Come on. 
 She's got a job. Have you ever seen her work? 
 Frankie, come on. She works all the time. 
 Out of the home? 
 Janie, she got her hair highlighted. 
 This is serious. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 She's a person. She's allowed to have her life. 
 Without dad? 
 God, I hope not, but that's up to her. 
 I mean, come on. Why don't you focus on your own life for a while? 
 Maybe it's time you learn how to cook. Hey, I can cook. 
 Burnt toast and boiled water doesn't count. 
 I do more than toast and boiled water. 
 Can I get you guys anything else? 
 Oh, so many things. 
 I would love a long vacation, for starters. 
 [ Chuckles ] How 'bout you? 
 New car, maybe? 
 How did you guess? 
 Uh, American. Mustang would be good. 
 I  love  that. 
 I grew up in Detroit, and my dad worked an assembly line. 
 Really? Well, our dad's a plumber. 
 Go figure. 
 Um...I'm... I'm Frankie. 
 Uh, this is my sister, Janie. 
 I'm Lola. 
 Nice to meet you, Lola. 
 Yes, I would  love some more coffee. 
 Oh! 
 Thank you. 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 What? 
 Oh! 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 Hey, doc. 
 Guy's not exactly husband of the year. 
 Beat the crap out of her. 
 Put her in the hospital a couple times. 
 Maura : Cold heart. 
 No kidding. 
 No, his... his actual heart. It's frozen. 
 [ Gags ] So is his right lung. 
 What does that mean? 
 He wasn't killed recently. He was in cold storage. 
 So he's been in the freezer. 
 Or possibly a meat locker. 
 I've stored bodies for months. 
 Unidentified bodies in 10 degrees without a sign of decomposition. 
 However, you still get freezer burn and discoloration, like his toes. 
 How long has he been dead? 
 Well, how long has he been missing? 
 Two years. 
 It's possible. 
 Ugh. 
 Oh, God. 
 Doc, what's this? 
 Adhesive residue. 
 From what? 
 Duct tape. His wrists were taped together. 
 Blanched indentations... his mouth was also taped. 
 Did the killer use a scalpel? 
 I have to find Jane. 
 [ Insects chirping ] 
 Maura : The body was frozen within hours of the murder, left undisturbed for two years, then thawed enough to be able to move his limbs, to redress him in a suit, and pose him on that park bench. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It's Hoyt. 
 He's... he's doing this from behind bars. 
 He killed James Stern and Emily. 
 If... if... if they've been missing two years, he killed them, what? 
 What, six months before he came after me the second time? 
 And then somebody stored the body for him and then just, you know... dumped it right in front of my face. 
 I haven't had enough time to confirm that this is Hoyt's work. 
 It's him. It's him, Maura. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 Um... 
 I wasn't gonna say anything because, you know, personally, I thought somebody was screwing with me. 
 This was left in front of my building last night. 
 A flare? 
 Oh, Jane. 
 I'm gonna call Frost. Okay? 
 We're gonna get patrol officers out here, and you are gonna get some sleep. 
 Yeah, well, not until the cavalry gets here, okay? 
 I'll stay. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 What are you gonna do... Hit him over his head with your Birkin bag? 
 W... Come on. 
 [ Chuckles ] Give me that. 
 No, it's loaded. I'll stay up. 
 It's loaded. No. 
 Magazine capacity... 15. 
 Trigger pull... 2.5 kilograms. 
 Line of sight... 153 millimeters. 
 Right... Have you ever shot one? 
 Um... 
 No. No. No. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 But I'm a fast learner. 
 Okay. 
 Um... 
 It's empty. 
 Okay. 
 Point it. 
 Um, wrap your left hand like this. 
 Okay, now, push and pull. 
 Loosen up. There you go. 
 Push and pull with the same amount of force. 
 Okay? Okay. 
 Good? Yeah. 
 You look good. 
 [ Chuckles ] [ chuckles ] Okay. 
 Okay. 
 You're laughing at me. 
 So...Okay. 
 Okay. It's loaded. 
 Okay. 
 I'm only doing this because I'm tired. 
 Okay. Point it that way. 
 Good. 
 All right, now, don't shoot my neighbors 'cause I'd hate to have to lock you up. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Jane? Yeah? 
 Do I look bad-ass? 
 [ chuckles ] 
 Yeah, you look like a bad-ass. 
 Okay, good. 
 [ Insects chirping ] 
 [ Camera shutter clicks ] 
 Mm. 
 The Sterns disappeared from their apartment in Charlestown. 
 You checked every Jane Doe in the last two years? 
 Maybe we found Emily Stern and we didn't know it. 
 No. No, there's nothing. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Her body is still out there. 
 If we could just find it, there could be some kind of a clue. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Korsak : It's me. Put your gun down, Frost. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Shh. Jane's finally sleeping. 
 What, are you having a private little strategy meeting here? 
 Did you think I wouldn't find out about Hoyt? 
 Whoa, don't come on in here, crack of dawn, yelling at me. 
 I was gonna call you. 
 Oh, like hell you were! Inside voices! 
 Hoyt's  my  case. Jane was  my  partner. 
 She  was  your partner! 
 Shh! Who the hell do you think you are?! 
 I'm her partner now! Oh, yeah?! 
 Shut up! 
 Her life is in danger again from a deranged, serial-killer sociopath who's... who's calling the shots from inside of a prison, and the two of you are comparing the size of your pe... 
 Hey, hey! Whoa! 
 Doc, hey. 
 Okay. 
 Shake on it. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 What, you heard me. 
 Shake! 
 That's better. 
 Now we can all go back to work. 
 Are you okay? 
 It's very distracting to work in a wrinkled dress. 
 So go home and change. 
 No, no, I-I'm not leaving you. 
 But I have some bad news. 
 Oh, and the day started off so promising. 
 The crime lab didn't find anything on the flare... 
 No DNA, no prints. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Well, I'm not surprised. I mean, why would Hoyt make it easy on us? 
 So much more fun to terrify the snot out of me. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Dean : Jane? 
 Hi. 
 Maura : Hi. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Looking for you. 
 You're back because Hoyt's back. 
 I'm back to make sure you're okay. 
 Can I, uh... buy you a cup of coffee? 
 Uh... 
 Uh, uh, yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 So, how you doing? You okay? 
 No. 
 But, you know, that's what Hoyt wants. 
 Well, we have the entire Boston bureau working this case. 
 I appreciate the FBI's help. 
 You know, he's got someone working with him again on the outside. 
 Well, he is in solitary, but all it takes is an hour on the prison yard to pass something, get something. 
 Been listening to his calls, tracking communication, but so far, nothing. 
 You're not gonna find anything. 
 He's smart enough to get rid of it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I should ask you how you've been. 
 Good. 
 Busy. 
 Two missions in Afghanistan. 
 Wow. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It's good to see you. 
 Wish it wasn't because of Hoyt. 
 Well, it sucks that all we have in common is a serial killer. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 So far. 
 You have really lousy timing. 
 Thanks. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 You look... 
 God, you look great. 
 Gee, thanks. 
 My beauty regimen is quite simple. 
 I just stay up all night... 
 Keep Hoyt from slitting my throat. 
 It's working for you. 
 [ Laughs ] [ cellphone chimes ] 
 Nice. 
 It's Maura. 
 You want to come to the autopsy? 
 That sounds lovely. Can that be our first date? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Yeah, that's actually an offer I've never had before. 
 Well, we never did have dinner. 
 Yeah, I don't usually eat at autopsies, so, you know, maybe after. 
 I'm gonna hold you to that. Come on. This will be romantic. 
 Maura : Hoyt didn't know his victims, but there's something very personal about the way he chooses to kill. 
 Transecting a carotid artery means that a healthy male like this could take up to six minutes to bleed out. 
 In front of his wife, Emily. 
 It's the ultimate way to control. 
 Kill somebody you love in front of you. 
 And he... he always went after couples, until me. 
 You were probably his biggest challenge. 
 That's why he deviated. 
 He wants to create the most extreme level of fear that a human being can feel. 
 Yeah, and he's darn good at doing it, too, isn't he? 
 I hate that son of a bitch. 
 I really wish you would've killed him. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Wish  i  had. 
 Hoyt thinks he's in control. 
 Uh, isn't he? No. 
 We show him that  we're  in control, we take what little control he thinks he has away. 
 I'm gonna go talk to that b*st*rd. 
 No, you're not. What "no"? 
 What, now you're gonna tell me how to run my cases? 
 Cavanaugh :  I  am. 
 In my office, Detective. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Come on. I know Charles Hoyt better than anybody. 
 I know his psyche. I know his m.O. 
 You are  not the lead investigator on this. 
 You sit on your hands. You hear me? 
 I  caught him, okay? Twice, I caught him. 
 That's the problem. 
 We're about to go to trial for four cases of first-degree murder. 
 That son of a bitch killed nine people that we know of. 
 He stabbed your old partner, and he tried to kill you twice already! 
 Yeah, which is exactly why I'm staying on the case! 
 Don't interrupt me! 
 [ Telephone rings in distance ] 
 That's why you're  not. 
 Hoyt made you a victim. 
 You're not a cop right now, and you better face that. 
 [ Buzzer ] 
 [ Door clangs ] 
 Here we are again, Jane. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 Going on a little field trip, Hoyt. 
 [ Chains rattling ] 
 [ Clanging ] 
 I smell lavender and fear. 
 Hello, Mr. Hoyt. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Dr. Isles. 
 You must be very proud of yourself. 
 That's a play I didn't see. 
 Yeah. That was the idea. 
 And Agent dean. 
 What brings you here? 
 The same thing that brings me? 
 Jane. 
 Mr. Hoyt... 
 I usually ask people to address me as "doctor." 
 I nearly completed medical school. 
 That's why you're so precise when you sever the carotid arteries of your victims. 
 Well, I've always been quite deft with a scalpel. 
 Where is Emily Stern's body? 
 Hold him down in that chair. 
 Are you gonna show me your technique? 
 50/50 cotton-polyester-blend fabric shows every wrinkle after a lot of use. 
 Ahh. 
 I thought I saw something. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I can't. 
 Cavanaugh ordered me to keep you out of it. 
 Come on! This is torture not being able to help, Vince. 
 I won't do anything. I promise, okay? Please. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It was my fault. I should've been there. 
 You didn't know, and I shouldn't have gone alone. 
 You went alone because I made it hard to ask. 
 It's on me. 
 Don't you dare say that, all right? 
 You saved my life. 
 So, why aren't we partners anymore? 
 Because you saw me like that. 
 So what?! It didn't change anything! 
 Yes, it does. 
 How could you possibly think that I have your back? 
 How could you go into a dangerous situation with me as your partner after seeing me like this... this... this broken? It's... 
 Now, you... 
 You listen to me. 
 He didn't break you. 
 No one can break Jane rizzoli unless you let 'em. 
 It's a choice. 
 I'm assuming it's for your research. 
 Maura : You assume correctly. 
 Facial action coding system. 
 Do you think you're gonna dissect my facial expressions? 
 Ah, yes. 
 Where is Emily Stern? 
 Oh, not far. Oh, no. 
 You know, she cried when I slit her husband's throat. 
 But why now? 
 Why have whomever is working for you pull James Stern's body out of cold storage now? 
 What's this? 
 Anger. 
 And this? 
 Empathy. 
 Something you don't feel. 
 I can mimic... any emotion, doctor. 
 Pretty good, huh? 
 Will you tell me where Emily Stern's body is? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 No. But it's not far. 
 Will you tell me if you plan to hurt Jane? 
 Oh, I do. I plan to kill her. Psychically kill her... And... and keep her alive until... I get out of here and finish her with my hands. I want to feel her blood covering my hands. I do. 
 You'll never get out of here. 
 Oh, yes, I will. But don't worry, doctor. I'm not gonna kill you. No. Rape you! Maybe. [ Chains rattling ] But kill you? No. 
 You're clearly trying to frighten me. 
 I am. 
 I'm not afraid of you. 
 I know. 
 Because you're like me. 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 Why'd Cavanaugh agree to let us move Hoyt here? 
 Convinced him it was safer for Jane if we moved Hoyt into our lockdown. 
 Federal prison's too porous. 
 Can't even keep out dope and weapons. 
 Hell, Hoyt was able to get a picture of Jane. 
 Jane's gonna want to talk to Hoyt. 
 I can't stop her. 
 And neither can you. 
 Don't you even think about talking to Cavanaugh. 
 Why'd she request a new one? 
 You mean why are you her partner now and not me? 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 I wish I knew. 
 What happened down there? 
 [ Whimpering ] 
 I'm not gonna move you. You're all right. 
 It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! 
 I'm sorry, man. 
 I had no idea. 
 I try not to think about it. 
 Oh, yes, I will. 
 Yeah. 
 But don't worry, doctor. 
 I won't kill you. 
 Rape you! [ Mouse clicks ] This is the face of violence, anger. Who knew? What's interesting is that his primitive brain still telegraphs the appropriate emotions to his facial muscles, which is why this threw me. [ Tape rewinding ] Maura :  Will you tell me if you plan to hurt Jane? Oh, I do. I plan to kill her. Psychically kill her and keep her alive until I get out of here and I can finish her with my hands. See, if he was fabricating this, I'd expect to see asymmetry in his face. Which means what? He's telling the truth. He's not planning to harm you right now. Oh, no, well, why would I think that? With the stalker photos and the dead guy pulled out of the freezer after two years? We know this because his facial expression isn't crooked? Jane... She's trying to help. I'm sorry. I'm being a jerk. I'm not afraid of you. Because you're like me. Hey, um, can you go ask Frost and Korsak if they've got anything yet? Sure. Thanks. [ Door opens ] [ Door closes ] You okay? Come on, Maura, talk to me. He's a freak. Okay? He gets to everybody. I did a... I did a lot of research into his... his background, his childhood. Maybe he's not wrong. What are you talking about? Maybe I am a little bit like him. You are  nothing  like him. I don't... I don't know, Jane. I... I was a weird kid. Were you killing small animals? [ Laughs ] [ chuckles ] No, but I dissected a lot of frogs. No, that's different. [ Sighs ] I just... I started to think about... things that I never... I never really thought about before. Here it comes. There  are  bodies buried in your basement. I spent a lot of time alone. You know, I was... I was adopted, and my... my father was a Professor, and my mother, she... she came from a wealthy family. I was an only child. [ Sighs ] I just realized something when I was reading about Hoyt that I... it just never occurred to me before. There was a lot of benign neglect. It's not that they didn't love me. It's just that I didn't ask for much. I don't think I really knew how. And the less that I would ask for, the less time that they had for me. They were just very... very involved in their... in their own lives and into each other and... [ Sighs ] They sent me to boarding school when I was 10. I actually think that I sent away for the brochure myself. [ Both chuckle ] Which... They were delighted. Oh, I just... I was really lost. Come here. No matter what happened to you, you are  nothing like that monster. Okay? Yeah, you were a little antisocial maybe, a little goofy. [ Both chuckle ] But... That's... that's not the same thing. Okay? [ Sniffles ] Man, we're a pair. [ Both chuckle ] Thank you. Hey, Jane? We got two units assigned to your apartment at all times. Friends of mine have volunteered. Okay. Tell them I said thanks. Sure. Maura, what is Frankie's face doing? Movement of the outer orbicularis oculi pars lateralis. He's happy. [ Laughing ] What? I'm being hunted by a serial killer, and my little brother's occipital spatula is orbiting. I'm sorry, Jane. Oh, don't be sorry. Frankie's got a girlfriend. Oh! We just met! Come on. Look, there it is! His occipital spatula... Look, again! [ Laughter ] Well, you'd be happy, too, if you found someone who could cook. She made me dinner last night. 32% of divorces are the result of inequality in domestic chores. Oh. Maura, come on. They just met. Hey, what if I came over and made you dinner tomorrow night? Uh, no, thank you. You can't cook. What if I brought Lola? That's fast. Oh, come on, Jane. I think you should let him. Yeah, let me. Let me do something nice for you. Come on. You're all hovering. Okay, I'm fine. I'm fine. No. Actually, that's a common reaction to fear as the rostral anterior cingulate cortex activates. A lot of people find neurobiology fascinating. Are they all neurobiologists? Okay, fine. Come make grilled-cheese sandwiches with your new girlfriend. She's not my girlfriend. Mm. Yet. All right. All right. Bye. I love you. I love you. Look, Maura, his gluteus maximus is beaming! Oh, enough with that! [ Laughs ] What'd you get? Aww. Look. She's cute. Mm-hmm. My mother's gonna hate her. [ Chuckles ] Maura : It's definitely mold spores. All right. Well, that's something. All it tells me is that the photo paper was stored in a moist, dark space. Like a basement. Can you isolate what kind of mold it is, where it might be from? Hmm. Looks like... Stachybotrys chartarum. It's a toxigenic mold. Is it rare in Boston? Well, it's not common. Requires a moist environment... Maybe a... a flood-damaged building? Flood damage? Can I use this? Of course. [ Keyboard clacking ] There was a class-action lawsuit in Dorchester... Five families all living in flood-damaged houses. They all sued the city when their kids got sick from that same mold you just found. See this neighborhood? All five families lived right there. You said five, but there are six single-family buildings. The sixth house is vacant. Or occupied by the same person who took Jane's picture and disposed of James Stern's body. Dean : What do you want to bet this is where James Stern spent the last two years? Must be a hell of a utility bill. Gives a whole new meaning to "darkroom." Hey, Korsak... "To: Jane." "From: Charles Hoyt." [ Sighs ] Woman :  Please. [ Voice breaking ] Please help me. [  Sobbing  ] I can't take any more. This is recent. This is the same paper that was on James Stern's lap. [  Sobs  ] [  Teacup shatters  ] Emily Stern is alive. Jane : Where is she? Where's Emily? Jane. [ Door closes ] Not far. Y-you seem very frustrated. You're not supposed to be here, are you, on this case? Hmm? Might jeopardize your ability to convict me of all those murders. Oh, you're gonna die in prison. That's enough for me. Oh. Well, can I go back to my quaint, little cell, then? Yeah. Just as soon as we find your friend. And until then, we're gonna keep you here so you two can't communicate. It's too late, Jane. Shut up. I'd show you my hands. [ Chains rattle ] We match. I should've killed you. But you didn't. Now, isn't that interesting? Why didn't you, Jane? Why not? It's not because you didn't want to sink to my level. Nah. That's not it. I've been wondering the same thing. Why didn't I kill you? I know why. All those women that you tortured and killed. Why? W-what made you go after them? Bad luck? Was that with me, too? Huh? Was it my bad luck?! Is that why you came after me?! Jane... No, I-I want to know! I want to know. You get to a point where you're not afraid anymore. I'm not afraid of you anymore. I want to know! Why did you come after me?! I love you when you're angry. I'm gonna love you when you're dead. [ Chuckles ] Why you? Every good boxer fights a worthy opponent, or the... the win is meaningless. And you, Jane... Are the only worthy opponent that I have ever had. Get this animal back to his cage. Emily :  Please help me. I remember this research from Columbia university. Using a series of algorithms, you can do corneal imaging. See, the cornea is a like a mirrored bowl. Well, the resolution isn't great. Jane's right. You are one impressive chick. It's not much. Yes, it is. It's a basement in the back bay. How did you know that? Emily's looking at a hollow sidewalk. I can't believe I know something you don't. It's a vault ceiling. See the bricks? There's a sidewalk built directly on top of it. When Boston used coal, carts dumped it right from the street through openings in the sidewalk. So, Emily Stern is in a coal cellar. Yeah, and the only ones left are in the back bay. Emily : Help! Please! I'm down here! Can you hear me? I'm here! Help me, please! Help me! Help! Please, I'm down here! That son of a bitch. Can you hear me? I'm... I'm down here. [ Sighs ] Okay. Lola. Oh. Frankie brought her up. He... he said it was okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no... That's... that's fine. Are you okay? I was making you dinner, and... I forgot, and it's... [ chuckles ] It's been a long, bad day. Do you want me to go? N-no. You know what? I'm just gonna... I'm gonna leave work at work. You should go. Okay, just, uh... just patrol outside, all right? Okay. [ Door closes ] Um... Where's Frankie? He went to grab some beers. Oh, fantastic. Oh... What are you making? I think it needs a little more salt. Let me see. Mmm! Mmm! Oh, that's delicious! I really like to cook. You know, it doesn't work out with you and Frankie, you can still come here and cook anytime. [ Laughs ] I'm gonna go change. Okay. Uh, dinner will be ready soon. Okay. Thank you. Okay. [ Muffled shouting ] Frankie. Sit down. Where's Jane? Frost : Went home. Frankie's girlfriend's cooking dinner. What's up? I want to show you this. [ Keyboard clacking ] Okay, look at this. Isn't this strange? Looks like cheek and chin work. Had her nose done. And the only thing you can't change is the space between your eyes. She had plastic surgery. Put these on. Do it. He killed your husband, didn't he, Emily? It's not the kind of relationship someone like you could understand. Aah! I want you two to be able to say goodbye. Why would a kidnap victim living in the basement like a p.O.W. Get her face worked on? She...didn't want to be recognized? Frost, can you scan this? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Getting it. Okay, got it. All right. Now let's compare these three. [ Keyboard clacking ] It's the same woman. Oh, my God. Jane. She  thinks that she's in control. She  is. No. We have to make her believe that she's not. Shut up, both of you. He doesn't love you. He did... enough to get him here. I mean Hoyt. He loves  me. No, he doesn't. He wants you dead. That's not what he told you to do, is it, Emily? He told you  not  to kill me, didn't he? Emily's dead. And you will be, too. Hoyt wants me alive. And he wants that because he wants me all to himself. Don't you get it? Hoyt doesn't love you. He used you to get to me. You're gonna watch your brother die now. Emily, wait! Stop! Frankie! Frankie! Stop! [ Grunting ] Aah! [ Grunting ] Shoot her! Aah! [ Breathing heavily ] You okay? Breathe. It's all right. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. Okay. Okay, okay. You okay? Hmm?
