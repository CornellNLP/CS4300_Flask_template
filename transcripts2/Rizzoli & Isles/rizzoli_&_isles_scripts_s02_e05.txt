 That's if you Pilgrim fans even went to sleep. 
 I'm still celebrating Manny "Mega" Vega's moon shot over the left-field fence. 
 As the Pilgrims continue to fight for a playoff spot in a tough division. [ Woman gasps ] Rizzoli & Isles - S02E05 
Don't Hate the Player 
Original air date August 8, 2011 Man : What a game last night. The Pilgrims are on a streak with "Mega" Vega. Chimpanzees do that. Do what? Grab their crotches. It's a sign of aggression. Welcome back to "Baseball Live." How exciting is this? Two Boston teams competing for playoff berths. But what the Red Sox don't have is Manny "Mega" Vega. Man, that Mega Vega sure can hit. "Mega" stands for "molecular evolutionary genetics analysis." Oh, he is quite the male specimen. Vega : Mega focus. Mega power. Drink my Mega-Ade to win every time. I'd love to Mega him. Oh, hey. Language. My mother's here. You should hear us when you're not around policing us. He's a hunk. "Hunk"? Mmm. Okay. Officially throwing up in my mouth. [ Laughter ] No -- Jo Friday, stop licking. Oh, don't yell at her. That's not yelling. Stop licking! That's yelling. Speaking of a kiss goodbye. [ Laughs ] Co-owners no more. Phil Young announced today that he controls the Pilgrims. Must be pretty upsetting for the ex-wife, Geena. That's too bad. Well, at least they're fighting over a baseball team. My parents are fighting over the snow shovel. I doubt it will. Oh, my God. Tommy. I forgot to tell you he was coming home. You forgot to tell me? Did you forget, too? [ Chuckles ] Janey. Hi. Ooh. Thanks for your letters. They really kept me going. I was looking for you three months ago. Yeah. I got in a little fight in the yard. They threw me back in, so... Yeah, well, let's not screw up your early release, okay? Fresh start, yeah? Yeah. Dr. Isles, I tightened up the flush valve in the guest house. Thank you. Please let me pay you. No, not a chance. I mean, it's the least I can do, you know? "All" you're doing for him? He's just visiting your mother. "Visiting" means dropping by and then leaving. When's he leaving? [ Sighs ] Jane, he's gonna be in violation of his probation without a permanent address. So the visit is permanent. Temporarily. The only thing that Tommy does "temporarily" is stay out of trouble. [ Sighs ] Jane, I know you. You're conflicted, you want to help him, but you're afraid that anything you do will be interpreted as a sign of approval. My little brother is a screw-up, Maura,  a completely lovable screw-up felon. [ Sighs ] The recidivism rate for non-violent offenders is higher than for violent. It's 46% to 39%. So I'm thinking this isn't a good idea. I'm doing this for your mother. You know, he's made some bad choices, but that doesn't make him a bad person. Oh, yeah, right. He did fix your flush valve. She's licking her paws. [ Whimpers ] Yeah, they're real red. I know. I know. [ Cellphone rings ] This is Dr. Isles. Okay, if the division detectives have signed off, I will authorize removal of the body. Thank you. [ Cellphone beeps ] Fatal slip and fall at the Pilgrims' locker room. That's weird they're not reporting it. Mm. Let's go. I've never been to the Pilgrims' stadium, and their locker room is closer than your couch. Come on. Well, I've always wanted to see them without their uniforms. Maura! This is Dr. Isles again. Uh, hold the body at the scene. I'm coming in. Thank you. [ Cellphone beeps, Jo Friday whimpers ] Um, you know, if you want, I can take your dog to the vet. No, your only job is -- is just stay out of trouble, okay? Bye, ma. Bye, baby. [ Indistinct conversations ] Body's in the shower, Dr. Isles. It's nice to see you, Detective Merck. Actually, it's  Chief  Merck now. Of course. Congratulations. Thank you. What brings you out, Rizzoli? Just tagging along. Look at you. You retire, land the plum job, chief of security for the Pilgrims. Yeah, it's a long way from working those late nights in homicide. Hey, listen, while you're here, we treat Boston's finest to a couple of tickets on the first-base line. I've only sat in the nosebleeds on police-appreciation day -- thanks. What's this look like to you? Uh, it's pretty sad. It's a poor fella on our coaching staff. Slipped and fell in the shower this morning. Team's pretty shook up about it. Oh, the coaching staff? That's awful. Yeah. Hey, listen. Why don't you go out and enjoy the game? I'll walk her through this, and I'll have her out by the bottom of the first. Well, if it's okay with you, I'm gonna, uh, wait here for Dr. Isles, all right? Uh, yeah, all right. Sure. Let me, uh -- let me go check on her, all right? Three, four, five, six, seven... You got to be kidding. Oh, wow. Manny "Mega" Vega in the flesh. Two, three, four, five, six, seven... [ Retches ] I guess we must look pretty strange. Well, does he always puke before a game? Yeah, yeah. Baseball players are really superstitious. Part of his ritual. I'm Jesse Wade. Detective Jane Rizzoli. And I know who you are. Uh, rookie of the year when you came into the bigs, two-time all-star. Impressive. Most women only know the superstar, Mr. Mega Vega. Well, confession -- I'm a big Red Sox fan, but, you know, maybe you guys can convert me. Yeah. Maybe. Man, you better move and get out of my way. Man, you shouldn't even have a locker, the way you're hitting. All right. [ Grunts ] Is that part of his ritual, too? No. The...Dead guy in the shower's got everybody spooked. Oh. Call me. Wouldn't mind being interrogated by you. Heard that line, like, four million times. You call me, and, uh, I'll think of a new one. All right. Feel good? Yeah. What's a coach doing in the players' showers? Coaches, players, managers all have access to the gym and the showers. What time did he come in? The records show 6:00 A.M. [ Sighs ] What is it? I'm not sure. It's a slip and fall. Can we just get him out of here? His body's already in advanced rigor. That's very simple-- the hot water was running when the cleaning lady found him. Hot water does accelerate it. It's this... Radiating circular skull fracture consistent with a hard impact, and this -- a second compression fracture to the occiput. Two skull fractures? How? He fell once. Well, he slipped, cracked his head on the shower handle, hit the floor. That's not what you're thinking, is it? The gash is wider than the shower handle. Something else struck his skull. A weapon? Wh-- you got to use your best guess. If there's any chance this was a murder-- murder?! Rizzoli, what the hell? There's no murder here. Is it a suspicious death? What does your gut say? I don't listen to my intestines. Maura. I'm declaring the manner of this death suspicious pending further investigation-- by the homicide unit. Take your V.I.P. Seats. Boston homicide sits in the nosebleeds. What's going on? I'm missing the game. Yeah, so is he. Oh, boy. That guy got hit by more than a pitch. What's Dr. Isles say? Suspicious death. And their million-dollar lawyers won't let us touch anything until the warrant gets here. Victim's a member of the coaching staff. Ron McKenna. I knew them all, right down to the bat boys. Never heard of this guy. Hey. Hey, you get it all? Judge Polk gave you the locker room, but he won't give you the stadium. I'm not surprised. He probably called the governor. He's not gonna cancel this game. What about the, uh, dumpsters? Judge said no. Fine. I'll type up another warrant and a find a judge who doesn't have Pilgrims box seats. Okay. Your retirement. Merck the jerk. All he ever talked about was the Sox. When that job went to Celluci, he sold his soul to get this one. He was in homicide 15 years. You think he did clean-up? Let's find out. Here. You know the drill. Uh, this is our house now. You can read that on the way out. Okay, I want all the dumpsters frozen. I want a man in front of every one of them. Oh, come on -- I got to dumpster dive through 40,000 hot dogs and blue shaved ice? Go before they empty it. If there's any evidence in there, we don't want to lose it. Hey, hey. Did you get my text about the Tommy surprise? Yeah, why didn't ma tell us? Wh-- [ Sighs ] At least she's not trying to throw him another "welcome home" party. Yeah, because he doesn't have one. Let's keep an eye on him, all right? Jane : Well, as the team owner, you and your lawyers must know why we want to talk to you. Well, my head of security, chief Merck, informs me that we've had a tragic accident, officer. Detective. Tragic, yes. Accident, we don't think so. So we will be conducting a full investigation. That's very thorough of you to dot your I's and cross your t's. See? I knew they weren't gonna try to use our tragedy to make names for themselves. Ron McKenna's badge identifies him as one of your coaches, but I didn't see his name on your roster. Well, Mr. McKenna was a recent addition to our coaching staff. Oh? What kind? Hitting coach? Pitching? Base coach? Special-assignment coach. What was his special assignment? White : I'm sorry, detective, but your warrant doesn't cover this part of the house, nor does it give you the right to interrogate anyone in this organization. I'm sorry. I'd like to help. I represent the entire organization. You will not speak with anyone other than me. What is she doing here? Y-you better get down there and tell Geena she's about to be in violation of her restraining order. Well, since you don't represent Geena,  I guess there is someone to talk to, huh, Walt? Sports guys are saying Phil took Geena's share of the team, locked her out. Well, he looks like someone who'd put up a fight. I wonder how he managed it. Geena : I have every right to be in that stadium. That is my team. Get all these guys out of here, all right? Mrs. young, Boston homicide. Can we talk to you, please? Homicide? So [Sighs] It's true about Ron. That b*st*rd won't let me in. Korsak : You knew Ron McKenna? Of course. I insisted we hire him. Let me guess -- Phil is stonewalling. Well, he said that you hired McKenna as a special-assignment coach. Oh, he had a special assignment, all right. He was Manny Vega's sober coach. You had a sober coach for your star player? [ Sighs ] It's no secret Manny has had issues. It was under control, and then about three weeks ago, he started having violent outbursts again. Didn't take a genius to recognize that he needed help, so I brought in Ron-- right before my asshole ex-husband locked me out. But how is Vega passing his alcohol-and-drug tests? Ask Phil. And while you're at it, tell him he won't have my team for long. I'd lock her out, too. Man : Stepping up to bat, D.J. Nixon! Rumor is, Phil's trying to sell the team to Salt Lake City. The Utah Pilgrims? How long am I standing here? Until we have a warrant. Vega was a wicked drinker in his New York days-- locker-room brawls, allegations of juicing. Well, maybe he snapped when his sober coach tried to take away his tequila. Garbage? Thank you. Hey! Y-you think I'm standing here to throw away your mess? [ Sighs ] Wait, wait, wait, wait. These have never been worn. This is brand-new. Backs of his shoes are wet. He was dragged into the shower with his clothes on. He didn't die in the showers. This whole thing was staged. [ Man speaking indistinctly on tv ] Oh, wait. Oh. Up there. You see that? Directional bloodspatter. Somebody swung away in here. Mm-hmm. [ Sniffs ] Smells like bleach. The count is two and two. Lindbeck winds up, delivers his knuckle ball. Vega swings. It's hit deep. Man : Deep over salgado's head, and... Gone! Somebody cleaned up a murder. The murder weapon is a cylindrical, heavy, hard object. Gee, what could it be? Think it's a pipe? A pipe is too thin. What about a majorette's baton? I'm glad that you find my scientific approach amusing. I think it's a bat, Maura. Man : Found blood. I think it's Manny Vega's bat. Let's compare it to the injury. The width of the barrel aligns with the width of the fracture. So Vega's our best bet. Now, how do we prove he swung the fatal blow? The way you always do-- do that gumshoe thing. "That gumshoe thing"? No, um, this time, we're actually up against every baseball fan, from judges to the governor. So it makes it a little difficult to do my gumshoe thing. Society's very reluctant to hold celebrities accountable. Remember Fatty Arbuckle? Fatty Arbuckle? No. The silent-film star who was tried -- Stop. Hey, Jane, our victim had multiple drug arrests. [ Jane scoffs ] So, this is who they hire to be the "sober coach"? Heard you got the warrant for the dumpsters. Yeah. I got blood, too-- on Vega's bat. [ Cellphone vibrates ] [ Sighs ] It's Korsak. He's interviewing the victim's son. Can you figure out what's going on with the searches through the dumpsters? Yeah, yeah. I'll check with Frankie. I'm off -- to do my... Gumshoe thing. I shouldn't have used that term. No, you shouldn't have. Because it actually refers to galoshes, which you aren't wearing. [ Laughs ] What? I... What did I say? We're very sorry for your loss. You're the only ones. The news, the radio-- they're calling my dad a scum bag. We will do everything we can to find his killer. I hate to ask, but... Do you know anyone that might have wanted to hurt your father? He's been clean since my mom died. Pulled it together for me. How long had he been clean? Five years. [ Inhales shakily ] He, uh, started an outreach center to help people. Why don't they report that? Did your father ever tell you anything about his work with Manny Vega? [ Sniffles ] Just that he was trying to help him. He helped a lot of those guys. You mean other ballplayers? Yeah. He blew his own shot at the pros with drugs. [ Voice breaking ] That's why he wasn't star-struck. He used to be one of them, s-so he -- he could connect. [ Sighs ] [ Sniffles ] Man : You should come by sometime with your kids. Yeah. Good to see you. Always a pleasure. All right. We just got shut down. Search warrant on Vega's house and car was denied. No grand jury on Vega, either. What? How can Merck shut down a grand-jury investigation? By delaying it till after the playoffs. And all the heavies are telling us to back off. Yeah, tell that to Ron McKenna's son. I didn't tell you to stop, Rizzoli. Now find a way to get to Vega. Nice. Cavanaugh just took the gloves off. Come on. Hey, Mega. Can I get an autograph? Give me the ball. Let's go. [ Tires screech ] Hey! Wow. Did you miss your lucky bat today? We had to borrow it. You're a cop. Listen, get the hell away from me and move your car. Oh, sorry. Is that blocking you? Ron McKenna's blood is all over your bat, Vega. How'd it get there? I'm not talking to you guys. [ Cellphone beeps ] I'm calling my lawyers. Ron bust you for drinking? Maybe that's why you killed him. I didn't kill nobody. Now move your damn car. [ Chuckles ] Phil, Merck, your lawyers-- they can't protect you forever. Get out of my face. [ Engine turns over ] [ Tires screech ] At least I got his autograph. Did Merck's timeline check out? Yep. Victim goes in at 6:01 A.M. never comes out. Cleaning lady goes in at 9:30, out at 9:33. After she found the body. Players don't use key cards 'cause they come through the players gate. So, we're never gonna find a record of Vega entering or exiting. Hey, turn it up. Look, it's gross incompetence by Boston police. This was an accident. Ron McKenna slipped and fell. What do we have on this cream puff? Phil? Nothing, other than he's an asshole. Man : Oh, look at all those drug convictions. You guys were great to give him a second chance. It's unfortunate he couldn't cure his own addiction. You just -- you... What about Vega's drug tests? Every time he takes a leak, someone's there with a cup. All negative. No steroids, narcotics, or alcohol. That's according to the team doctors. They got our backs against the wall. Find somebody who will talk. Jesse Wade gave me his phone number. Maybe it's time to make a call. Yeah. A booty call. Really? Hey. What is "Le Beau Truc"? Five-star French restaurant. Brilliant nouveau take on escargot. Is this okay? Are you out of your mind? What? I'm meeting Jesse Wade. He wants to do the interview there. At Le Beau Truc? Yeah. Le booty call. [ Chuckles ] What did you just say? I know. Unzip me. Wh-- why? Because you can't go like that. We'll trade clothes. Come on. Are you crazy? That dress wouldn't... Cover my...Booty. It smells like a deco. Oh, men are not attracted to the smell of death. Really? [ Perfume spraying ] Okay, that's enough. Oh. Those boots are fashion homicide. [ Sighs ] No. No! Those shoes are foot homicide. Put them on. They're too small. Give them back. You just said put them on! Patience. What are you do-- [ gasps ] Maura! VoilÃ . Peep toes. Thank you. Oh. You look sexy. You look... Like you're wearing my clothes. [ Cellphone beeps ] Hi, ma. Like you're wearing okay. Calm down. All ri-- where are you? Okay. I'll be right -- [ sighs ] [ Cellphone beeps ] I got 45 minutes. [ Inhales deeply ] Come with me. I'm gonna need backup. What? Jane, what did Tommy do? Jane! You have all the shoes! You think you can do that to people, huh? Take advantage of them when they're just trying to take care of their pets? You know what? I'm gonna neuter you, punk! Hey. Tommy, stop. Stop. I called the police. I am the police. Vice? Homicide. 
 
 I'm not there yet, but give me a minute. All right. Relax. Just...What happened? Jo Friday was licking her freaking paws off! Shhh! I'm not talking to you. What happened? I was treating this patient, uh, Jo Friday Rizzoli, and this man is refusing to pay the bill. All right. Well, that's fine. I got it. I will pay it. How much is it? $300. What? What did you do, bling her paws out? Exactly. And then he calls her a freaking head case! No, no, no, no, no. I did not use that terminology. I said, "she is suffering from depression." She has been withdrawn, restless, reluctant to go outside and urinate. Whose side are you on? She sleeps, eats, poops. What's there to be depressed about? [ Jo Friday whimpers ] N-- off, Jo Friday! It is an OCD reflex. It is triggered by her emotional state. She needs prozac. Here we go. OCD, ADHD, alcoholic-- same stuff they were throwing at me in the joint! [ Scoffs ] I'm not surprised you were confined to a cage. Hey, hey, hey! Knock it off! Knock it off, all right? Take Jo Friday, go home! Take her for a walk. You're already gonna blow your curfew as it is. Come on. [ Jo Friday whimpers ] [ Dogs barking ] I'm so sorry. They really are very nice people. You look phenomenal. Thank you. I thought we ought to stay kind of private. I'm not really supposed to be talking to you. Well, I'm not supposed to be drinking. I'm on the job, so... Um, tell me about Vega. You guys have been teammates for, what, two seasons? Man, you get right into it. Yep. I don't know. Uh... Feels like he's losing it. What do you mean? Just acting crazy, except when he takes the bat. Well, do you think he killed Ron McKenna? You're the homicide detective. What do you think? Well, it doesn't matter what I think. It matters what I can prove. Can you prove it? What was Ron McKenna doing in the locker room at 6:00 A.M.? I don't know. Yes, you do. Was he trying to prove that Vega was drinking and drugging? What? Yeah. He was hell-bent on it, so...Maybe, yeah. Well, you and Manny are friends. Did you ever talk to Ron about it, try to help? Ron came to me the day before he died. Wanted my help staging an intervention for Manny. I was up for it. But Vega's drug tests came back clean. When you're the face on the billboard, the name on a sports drink... Your pee has a tendency to come back drug-free. [ Chuckling ] Okay. You know, I didn't just...Come here to talk about the case. You're such a beautiful woman. I thought we'd have some wine. Thank you. Um, but, like I said, I'm on the job. Okay. These suck. [ Laughs ] Ugh! And your dress is about as comfortable as a straitjacket. Yeah, and your suit is a real booty-call magnet. I got hit on twice-- by women. Really? [ Maura gasps ] Oh, no. My tv -- it's gone. Somebody was in here. Ma! Tommy! Ma! Ma, come here! Jane, what's wrong? [ Gasps ] Oh, no. Tommy? [ Sighs ] Well, maybe it wasn't Tommy. I... I told the Palumbos Tommy would never steal their stereo. Tommy broke into some houses when he was in high school. Um...He never should have been staying here, Maura. I'm so sorry. It's okay. Oh, for the life of me! I don't understand why your brother does what he does! All right, look. I'll call Frankie, okay, and then we'll go look for Tommy. If he's on the run, it should be us that find him, okay? [ Sighs ] Come here, ma. It's all right. Okay? I'll find him. Oh, don't move, babe. The police got us surrounded. [ Chuckles ] You're so funny, Tommy. Actually, babe, move. So, uh, which one of youse wants to...Take me in? Where'd you get the money to buy the dinner and drinks for the townie? Did you pawn Maura's stuff? Huh? Maura's house was burglarized. Her tv, her jewelry... Her trust. She trusted you. Oh, you think I did it? Did you? Yeah, sure. Recession's my fault, mom and dad are getting divorced because of me. War in the middle east-- that's me, too. Is that what you think? They're not getting a divorce because of you, Tommy. They fought all the time. They fought over the freaking leaves in the gutters, Tommy. I am the freaking gutter. It's detective Rizzoli, officer Rizzoli, and Tommy the screw-up. That's what you've chosen. That's not who you are. We have a breaking story. Manny "Mega" Vega... Hey, could you turn that up, please? Has been killed in an automobile accident. Details at this time are inconclusive, but detectives are looking into the matter. Oh, geez. Of course, we'll have much more on this story as it develops. Tommy, you're on your own tonight. No babysitters for you. Man 2 : Once again, Manny "Mega" Vega, Boston Pilgrims baseball superstar, has died tonight in a fatal car accident. Wonder if he'll go down as one of the best hitters of all time or the baseball star who murdered his sober coach and then died in a D.U.I. Got the results from the contents of the sports bottle. Oh, from his car? That was fast. I processed it myself. That guy was my hero. I wanted to know if he was loaded. Was he? Can you put it down here? No. Glucose water, "B" vitamins, taurine, ginseng, caffeine. No drugs, alcohol, or steroids? No. This is strange. Cardiomyopathy. He has an enlarged heart. Congenital? No. Recent damage. Maura, you have that "I have a case-solving hunch" look on your face. My face doesn't hunch. It's minor pruritus. Excuse me? An itch. Hmm. His kidneys are damaged. Look at that crystallization. Yeah. From what? I'd be guessing. God, it's torture sometimes. [ Clears throat ] Have you seen this before? Yes. Okay. Good. What did it turn out to be... Before ethylene glycol ingestion. Antifreeze? Someone was poisoning him. Somebody was poisoning Vega over a three-week period. Was it Merck, Phil, Geena, or one of his teammates? Look, we've got nothing without motive. McKenna is collateral damage. Now, somebody was after Vega. Who and why? Okay, it's got to be somebody who could get into the locker room through the players gate, which says "teammate" to me. Wait. Frost, can you go on Youtube and pull up that dugout fight between Jacobs and Vega? They were going at it in the locker room. Frost : Okay. [ Indistinct talking ] Get out of my face! Hate's a powerful motive. [ Cellphone vibrates ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Maura's got something on our first vic -- sober coach. [ Shudders ] You can't look at a little vitreous fluid? Coming out of an eyeball? Jane : Come on. You said you had something. What are we doing standing here? Time of death is always hard to pin down. It's even harder in this case. You could be a little more patient. Job was like a cranky toddler compared to me. You spoke to Frankie? He's still going through all 12 dumpsters with every division detective we could spring loose. And why aren't you there? Oh, I know. "Ew! I hate eyeball fluid. Ew, I'm afraid of garbage." Why aren't you there? I know. Might mess up that nice sport coat from 1989. [ Chuckles ] All right. Come on. So, Geena hired McKenna because she thought Vega was drinking again. Yeah. She said he'd been having violent outbursts. Ethylene-glycol poisoning mimics inebriation. But we didn't find any traces of antifreeze in Vega's water bottle. Yeah, at least not the one in his car. No, w-- that's it. Wait a minute. Uh, baseball players are real superstitious, right? Oh, Mark McGwire wore the same cup from his high-school-playing days until it was stolen from him late in his career. Clemens put tiger balm on his bal-- [ Clears throat ] His balls? [ Chuckling ] Yeah. Don't they inspect those before they're allowed to pitch? [ Jane clears throat ] [ Stifled laughter ] Different... Balls, Dr. Isles. Oh. Let's just say they-- they have some weird rituals. Yeah, like drinking from the same blinged-out game bottle. Let's test the one in his locker. This is definitely the source of the ethylene glycol. So our killer was spiking Vega's special game bottle. Easy access-- just sitting in his locker. Just had to wait until the locker room was empty. Poor Ron McKenna-- he suspects Vega's drinking, decides to check his locker after the game... Catches the murderer red-handed. Killer grabs Vega's bat, whacks McKenna in the head, drags him to the showers. Smashes his skull against the tile, stages a slip-and-fall accident. Clark Jacobs could be our guy. He's got a locker right next to Vega. There it is -- results for the hypoxanthine test. The vitreous fluid from the eye. You did have a hunch. No, I simply couldn't explain his advanced stage of rigor mortis. And here's why -- 'cause Ron McKenna wasn't murdered at 6:00 A.M. At midnight? So why did Merck and his key card say 6:00 A.M.? I think our buddy Merck is lying to us. You're looking at an accessory to murder. Whoa. I didn't kill anybody. So why'd you alter his key-card entry time? I didn't. Well, maybe he's a zombie. That's why he took a shower six hours after he died. Maybe you got me on obstruction... But not murder. Okay. Works for me. Hey. Hey, hey. We thought Manny did it. I was told to protect him. Who told you to do that? You learn that trick in all your years as a homicide cop? Lawyering up like the scum bag you are? [ Papers slam ] I say either Phil or Geena told Merck to protect Vega. Whoa. Crime-scene techs found Vega's contract on his computer. [ Beeping ] Whoa. $15 million a year. Plus, Phil and Geena sweetened the deal. They each gave him a piece of the team. 1% each. Yeah, nice chunk, since that franchise is worth half a billion dollars. Right. Huh. Read the fine print. If Vega tests positive for drugs or alcohol or dies, both team owners get their shares back. Puts Phil and Geena right back at square one without their star. What's the motive? What's that addendum? Okay, that's weird. Three weeks ago, Vega gave Phil his entire 2% share of the team. Why? Give Phil control? That's how Phil took the team from Geena. He must have had a side deal with Vega. He had to. It's the only way Phil could sell the team to Utah. Yeah, and then Geena discovers that she was betrayed by Vega. That's motive. You know? Maybe she -- she hired Merck to do the dirty work. [ Cellphone vibrates ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Well, well, well. [ Cellphone beeps ] Merck just got bailed out-- by Geena. And Tommy didn't do it. What? Division-one detectives matched fingerprints from Dr. Isles' bedroom to a burglary ring. They've made arrests and got all her stuff back. [ Exhales sharply ] That's fantastic! [ Cellphone rings ] Oh! Hey, Frankie. No, listen to this. You what? Hi. I think we found the needle in the haystack. Unbelievable. Let me see. Gotcha. [ Siren chirps ] I know we got nothing on the outside, but what about on the inside? Can you get a print? [ Sighs ] This is not "CSI: Boston," Jane, okay? It's a very delicate process, and it's not always successful. Be great if it was successful this time. I can't concentrate. Did you apologize to Tommy? No, but I will. Let's just get the bad guys first, all right? All right. Well, why don't you go and apologize to him, and I'll call you if I get any latent prints. "If"? N-- the reason you have these gloves to work with is because I gumshoed. The least you can do is get me some prints. What are you-- why are you stopping? What are you doing? Waiting for you to leave. Wh-- you are ridiculous. Fine. Bye. Jane : Tommy? Tommy? What, you gonna make me use the siren? [ Siren chirps ] [ Dogs bark ] Knock it off. You're scaring Lola and Finn. We caught the burglars. Maura got all her stuff back. Well, that's too bad 'cause I was really looking forward to three square meals a day and a clean jumpsuit. Go home. I don't have a home. Yes, you do. Maura said that you can stay as long as you need to. Ma wants you there. Maura wants you there. You know what's great about dogs? Tell me. They're in the same mood every day. And they think I'm a good guy. [ Dogs panting ] They're good judges of character, Tommy. Yeah. They'd like a serial killer if he had lamb lungs. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. It's okay. I would have thought I did it, too. I got to walk them. I'm on the job. You're a dog walker? That's great. Oh, yeah. Mom and dad will be so proud. See you later. [ Cellphone rings ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Tell me you got a print. [ All cheering ] Man : Yeah! [ Laughs ] Way to go. Thank you. Way to go. Thank you. Great game. That was a great game. Whoo! Thank you. It was close. Congratulations. [ Laughs ] Hey, you can't be in here! Keep talking, I'll have your bail revoked. Phil... You screwed Geena out of her team. And, Geena, you would do almost anything to get that team back, wouldn't you? And, Merck... You just do what you're told. And, Jesse... Hey. You wanted to be a superstar. I got to admit, you got balls taking a cop to dinner. Did you think you could charm me, too? [ Crowd chanting "Jesse" in distance ] You wanted what Vega had-- face on the billboard, name on the sports drink. What's this about, officer? Detective. I think Jesse knows what this is about, don't you, Jesse? I worked for this. Everything was handed to him. He drank and drugged, and they just kept... Giving him more. My God. No. You killed Manny? Turn around, Jesse. You're under arrest for the murders of Manny Vega and Ron McKenna. A little to the left. Center it a little. Wait, don't-- don't drop it, Korsak. This thing costs more than you make in a month. That's still more than you make in six months. [ Southern accent ] Dinner time! [ Jo Friday barking ] [ Affectionately ] Hello, Jo Friday! You want your dinner? Yes. You feed that dog chicken? [ Normal voice ] It's organic. She licking her paws? Yeah, nonstop. [ Laughs ] What? It's not funny. I paid 300 bucks. She's still licking. Because a lot of little dogs like her are allergic to poultry. [ Gasps ] Oh. [ Jo Friday whimpers ] [ As Maura ] "Well, she has been withdrawn and restless, reluctant to go outside and urinate." Well, excuse me. I don't treat mixed breeds or four-legged creatures or anything else-- that's alive. Yeah, I forgot. Okay, knock it off, you two. Get the salad. Would you like me to reimburse you for misdiagnosing your dog? Stop it. Yes. Yes, I would, actually. That'd be nice. Would a check be okay, or would you feel safer with cash? Cash. Cash is good.
