 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 [ Horn blaring ] 
 [ Creaking ] 
 [ Shouting continues ] 
 We need more water! 
 Hill, Flynn, Grant! 
 Yes, sir? 
 We got to get this under control. 
 We got old, combustible buildings in a tight space. 
 Grant, you're with Hill. 
 Where do you want us, chief? 
 I need you guys to spread out inside. 
 Knock it down as much as you can, okay? Now, go! 
 All right, listen, I'll take the rear. 
 I got the roof. 
 I'll take the front. 
 Let's all go home. 
 [ Siren wailing ] 
 Let's go! Let's go! 
 [ Fire crackling ] 
 [ Wood creaking ] 
 [ Breathing apparatus hissing ] 
 [ Screaming ] 
 [ Horn beeps ] 
 Come on, Jo. Pee. 
 Hey, potty. 
 [ Jo barks ] 
 You know what? Fine. 
 Stay out here by yourself. Fine. 
 Oh, I'd hate to report you for doggie abandonment. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I was, um... In the neighborhood? 
 Thank you. 
 It's good to see you. 
 More than good to see you. 
 Mm. 
 No, don't be nice to her. Don't -- 
 Jo, you're not getting out of this. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 What are you doing here? You on leave? 
 No. 
 I, uh... I asked to be reassigned -- D.C. 
 Ah, so no more foreign wars. 
 For now. 
 Well, you probably have to get to work. 
 So... 
 What, you're going? 
 Yeah. But I'm hoping to see you soon. 
 What's the card say? 
 Read it. 
 Call me. 
 [ Jo barks ] 
 [ Cellphone ringing ] 
 [ Beep ] 
 [ Sighing ] 
 Hello. 
 [ Deep voice ] Uh, Rizzoli. 
 [ Exhales sharply ] 
 Rizzoli & Isles - S02E15 
Burning Down the House 
Original air date December 26, 2011 
 Good morning. 
 [ Laughs ] Damn it. 
 That's an awful lot of trouble for a cup of coffee. 
 Well, my mother is an espresso enthusiast. 
 Yeah, it's the burden of being a super taster. 
 My mother is also a super smeller. 
 I used patchouli oil once in college, and you said you could smell it on me when I came home for Christmas. 
 Oh, dreadful stuff. 
 How did you sleep? 
 Surprisingly well. 
 Her father snores. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Ohh. I don't miss that part of marriage. 
 [ Cellphone rings ] 
 Excuse me. Thank you. 
 [ Beep ] 
 Dr. Isles. 
 All right. Okay. 
 I'm sorry. I have to go to work. 
 A factory caught on fire early this morning. 
 Oh. 
 We'll be fine. 
 I make a mean eggs Benedict. 
 Dean asked me to dinner. 
 So go! 
 What about Casey? 
 I wonder if they know each other. 
 [ Horn beeps ] 
 Well, they were both in Afghanistan. 
 [ Sarcastically ] Yeah, Maura, all 30,000 of them know each other. 
 Well, Dean only went to Afghanistan because you said you wouldn't read the Sunday paper in bed with him. 
 I was not ready for that big of a commitment. 
 [ Laughs ] You're not even ready for the commitment of calling him by his first name. 
 It's Gabriel. 
 "Gabriel." It's just-- it's so weird. 
 It's so... Biblical. 
 [ Firefighter shouts indistinctly ] 
 Firemen's formation. 
 I  hate  it when they lose one of their own. 
 Sad. 
 Order! Arms! 
 I'll check out the body. 
 Okay. 
 Arson squad's working it, but they're saying it looked accidental. 
 Faulty space heater started a fire. 
 Hmm. What do they make in here? 
 Denim jeans. 
 "Denim" jeans? 
 As opposed to... Green polyester jeans? 
 See that guy? 
 Old guy in the skinny jeans and the shades? 
 He's not that old. 
 I busted him at least three times in the '80s. 
 Hmm. Felony fashion crime? 
 Would you two like a moment alone so you can fight? 
 He borrows my unmarked, and he brings it back empty! 
 Hey, it had gas! 
 Busted Whistler for cocaine. Now he owns a jeans factory. 
 Does he have any reason to burn it down? 
 Maybe. Check it out, Frost. 
 Sure. When you fill my tank back up. 
 With  super. 
 [ Siren wailing ] 
 His face shield is pitted. 
 He wouldn't have needed to take more than a few breaths before the smoke inhalation killed him. 
 It's a damn shame. 
 I'm so sorry, chief. 
 I sent him in there without any backup. 
 It's not your fault, Joe. 
 We've been fighting these blazes without enough people. 
 That's what budget cuts will get you. 
 This city's killing good men. 
 Forced layoffs, station closing. 
 Well, we can't do anything about budget cuts, but let's make sure there was nothing else at work here. 
 Jane : I never understood guys who wanted to run into burning buildings. 
 You chase murderers. 
 Not if they're on fire. 
 Do you know why firefighters call their outfits "bunker gear"? 
 Their "outfits"? 
 Yes, because they keep their outfits next to their bunks. 
 Darn! 
 Hey, did you know the first helmet was developed by luggage maker Henry Gratacap? 
 Does your brain ever get tired? 
 No. Why? 
 Well, just with all the useless information-- no? 
 God, how hot does a fire have to be to melt the face shield? 
 This can withstand heat up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 And he's got scorched gloves. 
 If his gloves are scorched and his face shield is melted, shouldn't the rest of his body be badly burned, as well? 
 Not necessarily. 
 The fire suit can withstand heat up to 1,300 degrees. 
 Huh. 
 [ Beeping ] 
 Pulmonary parenchymal damage consistent with inhaling air above 265 degrees. 
 Odd. 
 What... Odd? 
 He takes a breath or two, and boom-- he's dead by smoke inhalation. 
 The soot build-up on the walls and windows-- that's evidence of a low-oxygen fire. 
 But his face shield and lungs say it's a high-oxygen fire. 
 I wrote about this once in the  journal of combustible science. 
 Yes. It was a fabulous article. I loved the photos. 
 [ Gasps ] 
 I'll print it up for you. 
 Maura... Why waste paper? 
 I'll --I'll read it online. 
 You're not gonna read it. 
 No, probably not. 
 But you  are  going to dinner with Gabriel. 
 How'd  you  know I was going to dinner? 
 You brushed your teeth. 
 I-I always... 
 Brush my teeth... 
 At work... Sometimes. 
 I have a reservation at the ivory table. 
 I could call and make it r four. 
 We could double-date. 
 Really? Why? Who's  your  date? 
 My mother. 
 Oh, so, you, me, Gabriel, and your mother. 
 Mm-hmm. How can I say "no"? 
 You're being sarcastic, aren't you? 
 Very. 
 If it was anyone  but  you, I'd say that's the creepiest idea  ever. 
 The arson squad released the space heater to my team. 
 Hmm, did you just say the "a" word? 
 No. Yes. 
 So you think it was arson? 
 No. Yes. 
 [ Beep ] 
 No. Anything? 
 I think it's this heater that was recalled in 1997, but it's covered in debris, so I'm not sure. 
 Fire can be a very clever opponent. 
 [ Chuckles ] Yeah. 
 Take it apart. Look for any anomalies. 
 [ Keys clacking ] 
 I've requested all Boston fire department records for the last year. 
 That's like 4,000 fires. 
 4,082 building and structural fires. 
 Well, if you're looking at the incident reports for a possible pattern, then you are thinking the "a" word and I need to let the arson squad know. 
 I think Gabriel is a really good match for you. 
 Nobody ask you, Yenta. 
 Frost : Whistler, our old guy in the skinny jeans, is a pervert. 
 Okay, what would you like me to do with this information? 
 Check this out-- five different lawsuits. 
 Women suing him right and left for sexual harassment. 
 Two seamstresses, an accountant, a model, and... 
 Really? A cleaning woman. 
 Strong libido. Apparently it doesn't take him much to get interested. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Apparently. 
 Pretty expensive to fend off five lawsuits. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Maybe Arnold burnt down his only asset to collect the insurance money. Let's go talk to him. 
 Do you have an eye condition? 
 Excuse me? 
 Frost : The sunglasses. 
 It's safe to remove them. Our lights are harmless. 
 I've advised Mr. Whistler that this interview is 100% voluntary. 
 He's not required-- it's all right, hon. 
 I've got nothing to hide from these people. 
 Did you just call your lawyer "hon"? 
 Christie is my daughter. 
 She's Harvard law, right, hon? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I handle all matters pertaining to Arnold Whistler denim. 
 Then you're handling all the sexual harassment claims against your father? 
 [ Scoffs ] Nuisance lawsuits. 
 It's a bunch of angry single women. 
 Those are a lot of angry "hons," Mr. Whistler. 
 Those fat bitches are suing me for being nice? 
 Tell them I'm gonna sue them for leaving their space heaters on. 
 I'm  the victim. 
 My business is destroyed. What about  me? 
 What about the firefighter who died trying to save your factory? 
 Well, those are the breaks. It's his job-- hey, dad-- hon, don't interrupt me. 
 Listen to me, Mr. Whistler. 
 We're going to dig into your life, and if we find out that you had anything to do with setting that fire, you're gonna wish you were on the inside sewing jeans when it went up. 
 I don't appreciate your tone, detective. 
 Me, neither. 
 Come on, hon. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Your father never lets me eat garlic -- never! 
 I'm so glad you liked it. 
 It's delightful just being able to see you. 
 I wish we'd done this more. 
 Come to see me? 
 Me too. 
 No. It's... I-I wish... 
 You wish what? 
 I wish that I had stopped being busy and... Just enjoyed you. 
 Stop, mom, it's okay. 
 No. It's not. 
 It's really true that your life gets lived while you are doing other things. 
 Come on. Come on, let's go home. 
 Let's have some tea. 
 You know me. Tea's not gonna do it. 
 [ Tires screech ] 
 [ Screams ] 
 [ Tires screech ] 
 [ Tires screeching ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 Mom! 
 Man : Somebody, call an ambulance! 
 [ Gasping ] 
 Woman : Do something! 
 [ Siren wails in distance ] 
 Call 911! 
 [ Crying ] 
 [ Knocking on door ] 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 You look amazing. 
 You look like you're about to eat  here. 
 Hope that's okay. No? 
 No, it's okay. I just... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I feel silly. 
 I'm a little overdressed for take-out. 
 Don't. I want to look at you. 
 And I want you all to myself. 
 You know what? You can take me out. 
 I'm not gonna run away with the busboy. 
 What smells good? What'd you bring? 
 Hey. 
 Let's do this right. Do you have some plates? 
 Gosh, I usually just throw the food on the counter. 
 [ Cellphone rings ] 
 Okay, just... One sec. 
 [ Beep ] 
 Hey, Maura. What's up? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Elevator bell dings ] 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Are you okay? 
 [ Crying ] 
 Contusions and scrapes. I'm fine. 
 Where's your mom? 
 She's still in surgery. 
 It's bad, Jane. 
 They wouldn't let me in the ambulance with her. 
 [ Crying ] 
 He just drove into her, and then he left her. 
 [ Sobs ] 
 Oh, God. 
 [ Crying ] 
 Um, uh, what can I do? 
 Turn the clock back. 
 Did you see the car? 
 No. It all happened so fast. 
 [ Exhales sharply ] 
 I sound like all those people that we see every day, don't I? 
 It's okay. 
 She pushed me out of the way, Jane. 
 My mother saved my life. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 Oh. How is she? 
 It was a severe open book pelvic fracture, just like you thought. 
 Okay. Uh, and how's the bleeding? 
 We performed an anterior pelvic open reduction and internal fixation. 
 And the head and the cervical CTS? 
 There's some cranial bleeding, but we're doing all that we can, Dr. Isles. 
 I know you are. Thank you, doctor. 
 You're welcome. Just hold on. 
 [ Sobbing ] Oh, my God. What if she dies? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, God. 
 My father's in Tanzania. 
 Even if I could reach him, it would take him two days to get here. 
 Maura, she's not gonna die. 
 She's not. 
 [ Cellphone vibrates ] 
 This is Frost. 
 He's already working on the hit-and-run re-enactment. 
 Go. 
 No, no, no. 
 Yes. Yes. Please. 
 Go and do what you do better than anyone I know. 
 Find the b*st*rd who did this. 
 Please. 
 Go. 
 [ Sniffles, exhales sharply ] 
 [ Siren chirps, camera shutter clicks ] 
 Who a you  dressed as? 
 A person. Shut up. 
 Well, nice to see you, too. 
 I think you look great. 
 Thank you. 
 Now, show me what you're gonna show me, or I'm getting out. 
 The hit-and-run driver came from that direction. 
 Minimum speed the vehicle was traveling at the time of impact, 40 miles per hour. 
 Okay, you're just doing this to show off your car. 
 I could have read that in the report. 
 Can you talk to detective Rizzoli? 
 Because I can't. 
 I asked Frankie to do a hit-and-run work-up for the fatal-accident team to help him get into homicide faster. 
 So you want to see what I found out, or you want to pick your toes? 
 I'm not picking my toes. My feet hurt. 
 So don't wear dumb shoes. 
 Show me! 
 All right, yeah, so, there are no skid marks prior to point of impact. 
 So that means the driver never applied the brakes. 
 Well, maybe he didn't see them. 
 Frankie's got a different theory. 
 See those? 
 Locked wheel skid marks. 
 Those say that the driver stopped after he hit Constance. 
 So he didn't just take off. 
 But not because he had a conscience. 
 Take a look at the back-up cam. 
 He hit reverse. 
 [ Beep ] 
 That's where Maura fell. Right between those parked cars. 
 Spin burn marks. 
 This wasn't an accident. He was  trying  to hit her. 
 [ Beep ] [ Muffled scream ] 
 Don't scream, Maura. Okay? 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 I came as soon as I heard. 
 You came for  what? 
 For her. She's a good woman. What do you know about my mother? I'd like you to leave. Not until I know she's okay-- and  you're  okay. You're here to knock heads? You think that's gonna help? You'll see one day when you have a child -- [ scoffs ] Give it up. You're a murderer. I'd rather not be reminded that you fathered me. Go! Maura -- I'm gonna scream on the count of three. One-- look -- I'll tell you who your mother is. [ Scoffs ] That's my mother. You once asked me... Don't  like to be toyed with. Two. I will tell you one day. When you're calm. Get out. Jane : Did he say why he came? Not really. But he seemed like he knew her. He knew Constance? He said he'd tell me who my biological mother is. Do you  want  to know that? [ Scoffs ] Well, he can't just keep popping in and out of your life like this, okay, Maura? We'll get him. I don't know if I want you to. Well, it's not up to me. But you've got a more serious problem right now, okay? Somebody tried to kill you. Skid marks can mean a lot of things. Someone tried to run you over. All right? We've got to figure out who that is before they try it again. Jane, I have testified in hundreds of murder trials. Any one of those men and women convicted could want me dead. I put a uniform outside. Do you want me to stay? No. No, just keep digging. I'll be okay. You know, I'll never tell you that it'll be okay when I don't know that it will. But I am here for you. Okay? [ Sniffles ] Angela : So nice of you to bring these for Jane. And I always wanted to try these. You'd look great in those-- dark-wash skinnies, our top seller. What size are you? A four? [ Laughs ] I haven't been a size four since-- since never. Step away from the jeans, ma. I was too a size four. How would  you  know? What's the matter with you? The person that you're flirting with happens to be a suspect in a possible arson murder. What do you think -- that bribing my mother is gonna clear your name? Listen, hon, you're tying up my money with that insurance company. You bet I am. Take your jeans and go. Really? Frost : Crime lab found microscopic traces of black isocyanate paint embedded in the broken watch crystal. It's automotive paint, Jane. Oh, really? What makes you think that? Because she was hit by a car? Okay, how do I get you to talk to me like you talk to Frost? Well, don't state the obvious, first of all, all right? Did you run it through the automotive paint database? Yeah. Went back 30 years. Didn't find a match. So we're thinking custom paint job, maybe. Okay, see? That's... Better. I mean, it's still kind of obvious, but it's better. Could be an older car. What's the next step, Frost? He's about to impress you. We sent it to the Toronto forensic lab. Okay. I'm impressed. Oh, it's the largest automotive paint database in the world. Back to obvious. Unimpressed. Dr. Isles' mom gonna make it? I hope so. 
 
 Crime lab tech came by to bring you some photos. Yeah, she was supposed to take apart the space heater. They found all the components but the thermal cut-off switch. What, you think somebody tampered with it? Crime lab can't say till they have Dr. Isles look at it. You really think we're looking at an arson? Maybe. But I don't think that Arnold Whistler stopped harassing women long enough to take a space heater apart. Maybe we should check out those fire records that Maura was asking for, see if there's a pattern. Will you check with arson and see what is taking them so long? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Okay, what I'm about to say doesn't leave this room. [ Door closes ] Paddy Doyle's back in town. Oh, man. For payback. His daughter was a target in a hit-and-run. And... I didn't put a BOLO out on him. Makes sense-- let him watch her back until we find out who's after her. She's the one person we know he'll keep safe. Hell, Jane, for all we know, this all could be connected to Doyle. A rival trying to draw him out. I'll reach out to a southie C.I., see what he knows. Okay. I mean, we got to put Doyle away at some point. How's Maura gonna be with that? After all this, I hope relieved. Hi. Hi. Did you have a nice day? Oh, yeah. It was great. You? Is Maura okay? No. Are  you  okay? Sort of. I came back for one reason. Why, you need someone to drink a six-pack with you? Yeah. You. Um... Things might have gotten a little... Complicated. There may be someone else. I don't care. I'll take my chances. I came back for you. There was something on my cheek. Was it your hand? [ Scoffs ] You got to lay off the boxing, lady. It's all right. I should have asked. You don't have to ask. Mm. Oh, crap. What? I got to go check on Maura. Anything I can do? Yeah, um, you can go away. You're very distracting. No, you know what? Um, actually... Actually, there  is  something you can do for me. I don't really want to go away. No, come on. No, it's not that. Can you just be Gabriel? Please. Oh, my God. You just said my name. That's so weird. [ Chuckling ] Come on. Just... Not be agent Dean. Can you do that for me, please? Yeah. Paddy Doyle is back in town. Patrick Doyle. You think the hit-and-run is connected to him? Mm-hmm. I mean, if one of his enemies wanted to get back at him, Maura's the perfect target. [ Sighs ] And things could get a little ugly, huh? That's why you're telling me. Yeah. How will I protect her? Paddy Doyle is one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives. [ Scoffs ] Oh, God. Okay. Well, I guess we'll always have south Boston. So that's it? I... I pursue an organized crime boss, and you and I are -- I don't know. I don't know, Dean. But this always happens. Oh. I gave you my word I'd just be me. I won't do anything until you tell me I can. I'm not leaving until you finish those pancakes. I added quinoa. Dr. Oz says they're very good for you. Mmm. Thank you. You're here. Her vitals stabilized. She's still critical, but she's a little better. I really had to get back to work. Good. Hey, ma, can I have some pancakes? Yeah. I-I tried a new recipe. How are they? Gritty. Yuck. "Yuck"? What do I do with "yuck"? Do you have any macaroni and cheese? For breakfast? Yeah. Dr. Oz would not approve. Mac and cheese has a very high fat content, empty calories due to white flour. Do you have to ruin  everything? Sorry. My mother would never let me eat anything like that. Well, you were deprived. I used to think that kids who had bologna on white bread were lucky. Turns out I was the lucky one. I used to think that kids who had really big allowances and never had to go to church were lucky. Turns out they were. That would probably be a lot better with some grated pecorino Romano. Yeah. I got ketchup. Thanks, ma. Hey, Jane. I got 'em. Hey. Maura. You okay? Yeah. Thank you. Toronto lab found something. The transfer paint on your mom's watch matched "black diamond"? That's an old paint used on '70s police cruisers. Maura : That's encouraging. I mean, how many 40-year-old cars are still on the road? Can you take this upstairs to Frost? Tell him to put out a BOLO. We're looking for a 1970s old Chevy impala. Copy that. Thanks. Okay. So, I have to tell you something. I told agent Dean that Paddy is back in town. Well, you have to do what you have to do. Okay, but he's not gonna do anything until I tell him to, because... I told  Gabriel instead of agent Dean. Thank you. Arson squad sent over the fire incident reports. [ Scoffs ] This isn't even all of them, Jane. All right. We'll divide them up. About 400 have already been investigated by the arson squad. The rest were ruled accidental. Great. That only leaves us 3,700. They found the car! How do  you  know? Same model, same paint. Excellent. Come on, let's go. Kind of reminds me of the Blues Brothers car. W-who are the Blues Brothers? You did  not  just say that. No prints. It's wiped clean. Do you recognize it? No. All I saw was the headlights and the tail lights. All right. Well, this is definitely hair. And this is blood. [ Sighs ] Maura, it's okay. We got this. All right? I wanted to see it, I know it's just an inanimate object. I just-- it's okay to be upset. No, come on. I can't cry at work. It's unprofessional. I'm just gonna go to the hospital. I'm gonna have a uniform follow you home. Jane? Yeah. Transmission fluid. Nobody's driven  this for a while. Yeah, there's a trail of it. Car must have broke down. That's why he left it here. No plates or tags, no VIN number. Vehicles made before 1981 just had an I.D. Tag. How we gonna trace it? We can't without the tag. What is this? It's like a decal or an emblem was here. Can you put some fingerprint powder right there? Frost : Good idea. Might stick to the adhesive there. Yeah. What was here? Uh, can you take some pictures of this? A lot of 'em. Got something. What is that? A washer for something. There's a stain on the floor mat on this side. Doesn't look like blood. Hey, could you collect the floor mat and swab it before you take it to the lab? [ Camera shutter clicking ] I think our bad guy was in a hurry. She's doing much better. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Isles. You told her you're my father? I said I'm your uncle. I wanted to keep an eye on your mom while you checked out the perp's car. [ Scoffs ] How did you know that? I don't miss anything if it relates to you. I never knew you were there. [ Exhales sharply ] I wanted to be the kind of man who could be this little girl's dad. So why weren't you? I couldn't be anything but what I was-- a low-class thug from south Boston. My dad, my uncles, hell, my grandfather-- all Irish mob. And I grew up wanting to be just like them. Until I met your mom. I mean your birth mom. She was so different, so... Special. I wanted to be good enough for her. Why did she give me up? She was only 18. She was brilliant, like you. What the hell did she see in you? You know how many times I've asked myself that? [ Constance exhales ] Mom? Mom? [ Weakly ] Maura? What's happened? Mom, you've been in an accident. Somebody was here... Talking to me... Telling me... I must live for my daughter. [ Chuckles ] Was it Patrick? Patrick? Hey. What are you doing here? I'm distracting myself because if I don't fill my brain with "useless" information, I start crying, okay? Okay. Uh, any idea what this is? Where'd you find it? I thought maybe one of my techs misplaced it when they took the heater apart. How's that possible? We just found it. No, this is the thermal cutoff switch from  this  space heater. For  this  space heat? Yes. Where did you find it? In the car that hit your mother. What? A-are you sure? Yeah. So whoever tried to kill you in that car started the fire. But why would I be a target? Think about the timeline, okay? The arson squad says it's an accident. You ask to check the space heater. And then, next thing you know, a hit-and-run driver is taking a shot at you. I have results on the stain in the suspect's car. Thanks. Dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, glycerol. Commonly referred to, for those of us with a PhD in organic chemistry, as...? Cough syrup. Great. Low-oxygen fires don't burn at a temperature necessary to do this to his gloves. I can't explain the damage to his airway, either. Sorry, Dr. Isles, but you said you wanted the gas chromatography results when they were in. Thank you. This is the analysis of the substances I found on Craig Hill's face shield. There's something here. Gas chromatography is used to separate and analyze compounds that can be vaporized. Could you say that in earthling? There are trace levels of potassium permanganate on his face shield. Even more earthling. You see this? Cough syrup. We found traces of that in the hit-and-run driver's car. Glycerol is the chief ingredient in cough syrup. This is potassium permanganate. Watch this. Stand back. [ Explosion ] When glycerol is used as an accelerant, potassium permanganate becomes extremely combustible. No kidding. The outside edge of Craig Hill's face shield was coated in it. And then glycerol was added. The cough syrup. So somebody must have thrown it in his face. That's why his face shield melted. But what about his gloves? Why'd they catch fire? Well, it's possible the gloves ignited because they were coated, too. So he never had a chance. Somebody  wanted  him dead. Somebody who was in the fire with him. Maybe it was personal. Maybe. Bunch of white guys sued the Boston fire department in 2001. Claimed that their affirmative action hiring plan was discriminatory. Craig Hill was African American. Not bad for the old white guy. Now,  that's  harassment, Frost. What, the "old" part or the "white" part? [ Laughs ] Find out if any of the firefighters from engine company 15 were part of that lawsuit before Korsak sues you, Frost. [ Keys clacking ] [ Laughing ] Here's the original complaint. Yeah, Jim Grant. He  was  named. We talked to him. He fought the Whistler fire with Craig Hill. How many times I got to tell you? Check my damn alibi. We are. And it's a good one, Jim. Consoling dead firefighter's wife. Ask her. You didn't like the fact that Craig Hill had a lower test score, but he was hired before you, did you? No. Would  you? No. Wasn't Craig's fault. Department changed its policy. My dad was a firefighter. My granddad. And they're telling me "no" because of the color of my skin? [ Door opens ] Alibi checks out. Craig Hill's widow said he was there at the time of the hit-and-run. Hit-and-run? [ Door closes ] I thought we were talking about a fire. You can go now. Craig was a damn fine firefighter. We all miss him. We're sorry for your loss, man. This is what was on the back of the hit-and-run car. One of these. That's a St. Florian cross. Boston firefighters union used to hand these out in the '70s. Well, none of them are old enough. Maybe it was a legacy. Yeah, Jim grant said his dad and granddad were Boston firefighters. One of them could have given him the cross. No, grant's got an airtight alibi. It's got to be someone from engine company 15. Well, we could interrogate  all  of them. No, you can't. There's not gonna be any more interrogations. Grant complained to his union, and every firefighter in the city is lawyered up. And they're pissed at us. Well, that's not good. No, it's not. Oh, thanks. This is the last of the arson squad's fire reports from last year. They're all from engine company 15 -- where were they? That's weird. Craig Hill had them checked out. Our victim? Craig Hill is looking into every fire that his company responded to in the last year, and then he ends up dead? What the hell was he about to find? Carbon build-up, electrical fire, water heater explosion-- all of these were ruled as accidental. Happens all the time. Nothing I'm looking at looks suspicious, either. Okay, but here's what's weird. All of these fires started at 6:00 A.M. ... On a Tuesday in district 21. Does anybody know what's special about Tuesday in that district? Garbage day is all I can think of. Yeah. And the fires all began at commercial businesses in the early morning before garbage pick-up. Yeah. And what's a great source of fuel for a fire? Garbage. So Craig Hill must have figured out that somebody was deliberately setting fires in his district. Somebody that was good enough to make them look accidental. So when I requested the files to review them, I became the next target. So now what do we do? Well, our suspect is probably a firefighter. We got to flush him out. How? I might have an idea. Thank you. I'm sorry for this, but as the medical examiner, I am entitled to collect forensic evidence from city property. Anything else? My men aren't too happy. I can see that. And I'm sorry. There  is  something else. I'd like the plans for the Whistler factory. More evidence collection? Yes. Look, I can't guarantee the safety of that building. It's quite all right. I know what I'm doing. Thank you. You looking for where Craig died? Yes. It's Kevin Flynn. We found him right about here. And my grandfather died fighting the '72 Vendome fire. Maura :  I'm sorry. City kept cutting back and cutting back. How do you fight all these fires without enough firefighters, huh? You followed me? You shouldn't have come here by yourself. Why not? You know why not. I had to make sure people understand that they just can't keep laying us off. How did you do that, Kevin? You know how. I burned a few buildings. And then Craig started digging around. Just like you. You both should have just left it alone. Kevin, don't! Don't! Drop your weapon, Doyle! Jane : Gabriel, no! No! [ Gunshot ] [ Groans ] What the hell? [ Gun cocks ] No!
