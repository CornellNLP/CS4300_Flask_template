 Frankie : Ah! 
 Oh! Finally. 
 You're still down by 10. 
 I will beat you someday. 
 Check. 
 You beat me in everything. 
 Let me be better at something. 
 You ready? Sure? 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 [BOTH GRUNT AND LAUGH] 
 Frankie : All right, all right. Here it is. 
 Game point. Rizzoli, Rizzoli. 
 Jane : Take a shot! 
 Frankie : Oh! 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Frankie : No, no, come on. Let's see it. Oh! 
 Jane : No, I'm good. 
 Jane : What? 
 Frankie : No. That's bad. Come on. 
 Jane : It's bad? 
 Frankie : Yeah, let's get you some ice. 
 Hold your head up. Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 All right. 
 Just don't touch. 
 Yeah, that's broken. 
 It's broken? 
 Let me see. Hey. Okay. 
 Ow! God! 
 Jane : Why you gotta do that? 
 Frankie : Get ice on it. 
 Come on. 
 Well, hurry up. 
 Come on. Keep it up. Keep it up. 
 It's up. 
 Just get something before Mom comes. 
 All right. Here, here. 
 There you go. 
 Jane : Thank you. 
 On the good towel. 
 Frankie : All right. 
 What? 
 Uh, excuse me. 
 Aah! What happened? God! 
 How do you always manage to turn Sunday dinner... into a circus every week? 
 Me? 
 Angela : Yeah, you. 
 I did it. 
 It's his fault. 
 Oh, I know you didn't mean to do it. 
 So this is my fault? 
 Look, I tell you all the time. 
 Don't roughhouse with him. 
 Don't roughhouse with him. 
 [ANGELA GROANS] 
 [CELL PHONE RINGING "DRAGNET" THEME] 
 Oh, someone... Uh, Bird. 
 Bird keeps calling you. 
 Detective Crowe? 
 Mm. 
 You answered my phone? Why didn't you just tell me? 
 Because you were having so much fun... having your... 
 Rizzoli. 
 Frost :  Frost. Bad things in West Roxbury. 
 I'll be right there. 
 Dad and Tommy are gonna be here any minute. 
 I told you I was on call. 
 Here. It won't be attractive if your nose swells up. 
 You never know who you might run into. 
 Ma! 
 What? 
 Because I meet so many great guys at work. Too bad they're all dead. Ha. 
 Ow. Later, jerk. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Jane : No, you're not. 
 Frankie : Okay. 
 Have fun. 
 Jane : Yeah, thanks. 
 [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] 
 Reporter : News of a brutal murder. 
 A doctor in an upscale Bellevue Hill neighborhood in West Roxbury. 
 Shocked and terrified, this victim... 
 It's the coroner. Go, go. 
 Dr. Isles, tell us about the murder. 
 I'll have a statement for you later tonight, Kitty. 
 Detective. 
 What's up, doc? 
 Man : Evening, Dr. Isles. 
 Hello, Casey. 
 Dr. Maura Isles, chief medical examiner. 
 Come on, it's your lucky day. 
 Can't say this on camera, but we call Dr. Isles "queen of the dead." 
 What's that, Crowe? 
 Jeez, take a Midol. 
 Commander cleared you? 
 What's it to you? 
 My case. 
 Since when? I'm up. I got clearance. Move. 
 Spoke to the commander. It's my case. Where's Frost? 
 Losing his lunch. Where else? 
 Frost : Ugh! 
 God. 
 He should've stayed in Robbery. Hangnails make him gag. 
 Guy gives us a bad name. 
 Come on. Leave him alone. 
 You okay, buddy? 
 Something I ate. 
 Where's the crime scene? 
 Follow your nose. 
 Might bring back memories. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 You'll see. 
 Have fun, Rizzoli. 
 Hands hurt? 
 Yeah. It's gonna rain. 
 Rizzoli. Homicide Victor 825. 
 Going back for more, Frost? 
 Ah. 
 Not in South Boston anymore, Dorothy. 
 Korsak? I thought you were on vacation. 
 Cut it short. 
 That bad? 
 Worse. 
 Oh, man. 
 Ten centimeters. 
 Jane, if you got this, I can start processing the rest of the house. 
 Yeah, go ahead. 
 [KORSAK CHUCKLES] 
 Carotid artery and jugular have been transected. 
 What's odd is how precise it is. 
 Hairline fracture of the nasal bone above the lateral nasal cartilage. 
 It's not disfiguring. 
 Looks pretty disfiguring to me. 
 Can you pop this out for me? 
 Can't you do something safe like yoga? 
 Might hurt a little. 
 Okay. 
 Jane : Mm. Okay. 
 Ow! A little? 
 Put some ice on it... for the next 24 hours so you don't look like Mike Tyson. 
 Jane : Unh! Ow! Mm. 
 Victim is Dr. Martin Yeager, 34. Wife, Gail, is missing. 
 Diamond was too small, so she whacked him and walked out. 
 Ha, ha. No. We found signs of forced entry. 
 Well-to-do couple. 
 Man is bound and posed. Woman is missing. 
 And a teacup. 
 Jane : Melissa. 
 Is he out? 
 Is the Surgeon out? 
 Oh, my God. Korsak? 
 He's not out. It's his M.O. That's all. 
 Why didn't you warn us? Warn Jane. 
 I wanted your unbiased assessment. Looks like Hoyt, right? 
 We put that son of a bitch behind bars. Tell me how this is possible. 
 It's not. I spoke with prison authorities. He's in lockdown. 
 Look. Stun gun marks. Right there. Just like Hoyt's victims. 
 Any sick perp could have done this if he watched TV news and read a paper. 
 Except we didn't release this detail. 
 Hoyt's trained an apprentice. 
 [SNIFFS] 
 [THUNDER RUMBLING] 
 [MEN GRUNT] 
 Hey, uh, can I get a scanner from you? 
 Yeah. 
 Jane : Thank you. 
 Man : He's coming out of rigor. 
 You want us to crack him? 
 No. Put him on his side. 
 Hoyt's the reason you don't wanna be partners? 
 You know why. 
 I'm allergic... to those sad and furry little creatures you keep rescuing, Detective Dolittle. 
 You never sneezed. 
 Man : Hello. 
 Special Agent Gabriel Dean. 
 You must be Detective Rizzoli, and you must be Dr. Maura Isles. 
 What's the FBI doing here? 
 Dean : Saw the homicide advisory. And possible kidnapping. 
 We have an APB out on Gail Yeager. 
 Yeah, so do we. 
 You get a lot of routine advisories. What's special about this one? 
 Hey, you know we're on the same side, right? 
 Are we? Oh, because, you know... you fed boys, you like to show up, take the bat and the ball. 
 Just here to observe. 
 Right. 
 Jane, I'll be doing the autopsy in the morning. 
 Okay. 
 Come if you like. 
 Korsak : Hey, Rizzoli. 
 Yeah? 
 Semen. 
 So he raped the wife and made the husband watch. 
 Just like Hoyt. 
 [INMATES SHOUTING] 
 Inmate : Look at me! Look at me! 
 Jane. 
 How lovely to see you. 
 Haven't seen you since the trial. 
 Get his ass in the chair. 
 Ah. I like that scent. 
 The smell of lavender and fear. 
 See one. Do one. Teach one. 
 That's what they taught you in medical school. 
 Who did you teach, Hoyt? 
 Hoyt : I dropped out, Jane. 
 I mean, you know that. 
 You were kicked out. 
 For fondling a corpse. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 That's very good, Jane. You've learned how to irritate me. 
 I wanna see them. 
 Hands are so useful. 
 Dexterous. 
 And yours played the piano. 
 Do they still work? 
 Good as new. 
 So your turn. You trained somebody, didn't you? 
 I love your neck. 
 It's so beautiful. 
 And your breasts. 
 Very firm. 
 Answer the question. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Tell me, Jane, what would you like to do to me? 
 I'd like to get my gun... 
 Hmm. 
 ...and put it in your mouth and pull the trigger. 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 It is so much better slowly, to take your time. 
 You know, all my life I've been meticulous... about finishing what I start. 
 And that bothers me. 
 Because I haven't finished what I started with you. 
 And you won't, you sick scumbag. 
 Do you dream about me, Jane? Because I dream about you. 
 I don't even think about you. 
 But I tell you what, I'll visit you every day if you tell me who your friend is. 
 Who killed Dr. Yeager, and where's his wife? 
 [SIGHS] 
 I see that our time's up. 
 I do dream about you. 
 Am I ever your lover? 
 That's enough, you son of a bitch! That's enough! 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 But you're right, Jane. I should play fair. 
 My friend is out there. 
 Enjoy him. 
 Because he'll enjoy you. 
 [CELL PHONE RINGING] 
 Rizzoli. 
 Yeah, okay. We'll be right there. 
 They found Gail Yeager. 
 [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] 
 Hey, uh, I'll catch up. 
 [DOG BARKS] 
 [OFFICERS CHATTERING] 
 Are you wearing lipstick, Rizzoli? 
 Shut up. 
 Dog find her? 
 Yeah. Lucky he got loose. 
 We wouldn't have found her till summer. Who's a good boy? 
 How did you get here so fast? 
 I was in the area. 
 Ooh. Everybody's so lucky today. 
 Maura : Vitreous potassium. 
 Helps us determine postmortem interval. Nice and clear. 
 About 36 hours. 
 Look at the body, the way it's laid out. 
 Like she's taking a nap or reading a novel. 
 It's odd, isn't it? 
 Yeah, why didn't he bury her? 
 Didn't have time. 
 It means something. 
 [SCREAMS] 
 Where's Frost? 
 Uh, paperwork. 
 Oh. Wiping his face with it after he puked? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Did you do a wet prep yet? 
 I hadn't planned to, but I can. 
 Those little guys really are swimmers. 
 Quite fresh. Deposited postmortem. 
 Ugh. 
 How did you know? 
 I didn't. 
 Yes, you did. 
 It's not standard procedure to check for evidence of necrophilia. 
 You wanna tell us why you're really here? 
 I'd like a copy of your report. 
 As a courtesy. 
 [DOOR OPENS IN DISTANCE] 
 Let's go, Hoyt. 
 You got your one hour on the yard. 
 [HOYT GROANING] 
 He's faking. Be careful. 
 [GROANING] 
 I found carpet fiber on Gail Yeager's body. 
 Lab is processing it. 
 Thanks. 
 Hoyt didn't meet his apprentice in prison. 
 Or medical school. All 80 classmates are clean. 
 You guys eating cat food? 
 Jane : Yeah, you want some? 
 No. 
 Guess it's a chick thing. 
 What's up? 
 You may wanna sit down. 
 No. Tell me. 
 A few hours ago, uh, Charles Hoyt escaped custody. 
 Oh, my God. 
 [ALL SCREAM] 
 Jane : Why wasn't he cuffed? 
 Two doctors assured me he was suffering from appendicitis. 
 Two hundred milligrams of Decadron give him an abnormal white cell count. 
 It mimics all the symptoms. 
 Doesn't explain how he got out of here. 
 What's he doing? 
 It's a message for me. 
 Frankie : Go stay with Mom and Dad. 
 No. I am staying in my own home. 
 He's not gonna do this to me again. 
 Frost, go get some sleep. 
 I'm fine. 
 If I was a guy, you wouldn't be worried. 
 You're not a guy. 
 No, I am a homicide detective. 
 And he is not gonna kill me. 
 Really? 
 He almost did. I mean, look at your hand! 
 Hey, Frankie, come on. 
 Please take him. 
 We'll be outside. Come on. 
 All right. All right, that's the way you want it. 
 Fine. But if you have a boyfriend over, we'll know. How's that? 
 [DOOR LOCKS] 
 [VACUUM CLEANER HUMMING] 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 [VACUUM CLEANER STOPS] 
 [KNOCKING CONTINUES] 
 Hi, Marisa. 
 Hey. 
 Did the vacuum cleaner wake you? 
 No, no, I was up studying. 
 Come in, come in, come in. 
 How's law school? 
 Awful. 
 Remind me again why I wanted to be a lawyer. 
 [JANE CHUCKLES] 
 I know, right? Where the hell was I on Career Day? 
 Just making sure you're okay. 
 Um... 
 Yeah, why would you ask? 
 You always vacuum when you have a really tough case. 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 No! 
 [KNOCKING CONTINUES] 
 Mom. 
 That lipstick doesn't flatter you. It's too pink, babe. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 [JANE SIGHS] 
 Angela : I hope Frankie Jr.'s okay down there. 
 Hoyt's not after Frankie, Mom. 
 Your father's out there also. 
 My God, did you bring the dog too? 
 Why would I bring the dog? 
 What, Ma? 
 Aw, come on, it's the middle of the night. 
 Who could sleep? Ever since you had this crazy idea... to become a police officer, I haven't stopped worrying. 
 I never know if you're coming home. 
 And your brother, Frankie, wants to do exactly what you do. 
 Everything you do, he follows it. 
 Jane : I'm leaving. 
 You're leaving? Where are you going? 
 Someplace where you're not. 
 Jane. 
 Jane, come on. Be reasonable. 
 They don't pay you enough money, I mean... 
 They don't pay me at all. 
 [DOORBELL RINGS] 
 Why do you always look like you're about to do a photo shoot? 
 Thank you. 
 God! What is that? 
 Shh. You'll scare him. 
 He's alive? 
 His name is Bass.  Geochelone sulcata.  African Spurred Tortoise. 
 I've had him since he was like this big. 
 Partial to British strawberries. 
 Bass? What, after an old boyfriend? 
 William M. Bass, forensic anthropologist who founded the famous body farm. 
 Right, yeah. That Bass. 
 Here you go. It's okay. 
 Yeah, he's a great pet. 
 Really interactive, I'll bet. 
 Mm-hm. 
 So how long can a person go without sleeping? 
 Hallucinations begin by day four... followed by slurred speech, short attention span and death. 
 You're better than Wikipedia. 
 Wikipedia is frequently incorrect. 
 Very little is rigorously peer-reviewed. 
 
 
 
 [DOORBELL RINGS] 
 Somebody's just dropping something off. 
 Hey. 
 [BOTH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 Go away. I'm asleep. 
 Are we having a sleepover... or is this your way of telling me you're attracted to me? 
 So it was Dean you were expecting. 
 He wanted my opinion on another case. 
 What case? 
 I can't say. 
 Fine. Go sleep in your own room. 
 Oh, Jane. 
 [MAURA SIGHS] 
 You ever like the same guy as your best friend? 
 No. 
 Did you ever have a best friend? 
 No. 
 You'd tell me if you were a cyborg, right? 
 No, I don't think I would. 
 Ha-ha-ha. 
 I'm not seeing him. 
 Yet. 
 Well, somebody should, don't you think? 
 Yup. 
 Should we draw straws? 
 Couldn't we just show him our tits and let him decide? 
 [MAURA LAUGHS] 
 [THUMP OUTSIDE] 
 No, it's okay. It's just Bass. 
 Really, it's okay. 
 I've never been so scared in all my life. 
 You look like you slept under an overpass. 
 How are you still single? 
 You gotta stop this. 
 Stop what? 
 This stuff with Frost. 
 Lab identified the carpet we found on the victim. It's called Antron. 
 It's not Frost's fault that he was partnered with me. 
 Navy blue carpet. From a car. 
 You wanna hear what I got or not? 
 Yeah. You want coffee? 
 Navy blue's a popular color. 
 Two million vehicles with this type of carpet fiber. 
 Swell. 
 It's not my fault it's a popular color. 
 I take three sugar. 
 For Christ's sake, since when? 
 Since, I don't know. Since for a while. You'd know if we were still partners. 
 What about the semen we found? 
 No hits. 
 How is that possible? 
 Easy. Our UNSUB's not in CODIS. 
 Ran the prints we had too. Nothing. 
 Our UNSUB's a ghost. 
 Pardon me, yours and Frost's UNSUB's a ghost. 
 Thought you said you take three sugar. 
 It's bad for me. 
 Two sugars is bad. The creamer is bad. 
 Like you care! 
 That's it! 
 [JANE SIGHS] 
 Hey, about the other day, I should've given you a heads-up. 
 It's okay. 
 No. It's not. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry too, Korsak. 
 [PHONE RINGING] 
 Rizzoli. 
 Where? 
 Okay. Page Frost. 
 I gotta go. They found another victim. 
 [CAMERA CLICKING] 
 Maura : His name's John Ghent. 
 His wife Karenna's missing. 
 No sign of a teacup. You know what that means. 
 Yeah. He didn't need a warning device because he had an accomplice. 
 Hoyt. 
 Jane. 
 You better come see this. 
 Man : Hey, all I know is I got a delivery for a Detective, uh, Rizzoli. 
 That's me. 
 Officer : Don't worry about that. Now let me see some form of ID. 
 Jane : Hoyt. 
 Maura : Then who's Henry Deduboto? 
 Ted Bundy. 
 That's five letters too many for that anagram. 
 How do you do that? Fine, Theodore Bundy. 
 He was fascinated with necrophilia. Just like the apprentice. 
 I bet that's why Gail Yeager's body was laid out like his lover. 
 Maura : So he could visit. 
 Jane : Anytime he wanted. 
 But we found her. 
 So he had to kill again. This time with Hoyt. 
 My guess is Karenna Ghent is his new girlfriend. 
 [CELL PHONE RINGING "DRAGNET" THEME] 
 Frost? 
 Where? 
 Keep it off the radio. Take his phone. 
 Hide your car. All right? I'm on my way. 
 [SIGHS] 
 You are not gonna like what we're about to do. 
 Frost : Only call he made was to 911. Dispatch put it straight through to me. 
 Jane : Good. What was he doing way out here? 
 Looking for Indian arrowheads. 
 Native American. 
 The Wampanoag Tribe was the last to inhabit the area. 
 Also known as the Massachusett. 
 Get him to a uniform. Take him downtown, hold him as long as you can. 
 Call Korsak. Get him out here. Tell him the plan. 
 I'm on it. 
 Maura : What plan? 
 We're gonna surveil this body. 
 What, you...? You mean, leave her here? 
 Yes. 
 I said you wouldn't like it. Let's go. 
 No. I'm calling my team. 
 Maura, they weren't expecting anyone to find this body. Look where she's hidden. 
 Okay, hear me out. We get the hell out of here. 
 We put both the park entrances under surveillance. 
 What makes you think Hoyt isn't watching you now? 
 He might be. I am willing to take that gamble. 
 What, by leaving this body here in hopes that they'll return? No. 
 No, every second she stays here, more forensic evidence is lost. 
 Maura, please. 
 The faster we get out of here, the better chance of not being discovered. 
 Okay? Because if we don't do this, we got nothing. 
 If we take this body back now, all we'll find out is: "Yup, she's dead," and, "They killed her." 
 Please. 
 Do this for me. 
 [OWL HOOTING] 
 [SNIFFS] 
 You still got the north entrance, Frost? 
 Frost (over radio) :  Affirmative. 
 If you wanna sit in his car, go ahead. 
 Shut up. 
 Excuse me? 
 Not you. 
 They're coming at night, so keep your eyes peeled. 
 Roger that. 
 [KORSAK YAWNS] 
 What is the smell? 
 What smell? 
 You know what smell. There's an animal in here. 
 Ah, something licked me. What is it? 
 Oh, it's just Jo Friday. 
 Ew, he's filthy. 
 She. 
 Jo? 
 Jo, like Josephine. 
 Found her by the side of the road this morning. 
 [SNEEZES] 
 Hey, you sneezed. 
 I told you, I'm allergic. 
 Korsak, it's either him or me. 
 What...? Please don't. 
 [DOG WHINING] 
 Hey, what about him? 
 Her. 
 She stays. I gotta pee. 
 You gotta be kidding me. 
 Nice doggy. 
 [GAGS] 
 My God, what have you been in? You gotta go. You gotta go. 
 Oh. Ugh. 
 [BARKS] 
 "Later that same day..." Come on. 
 [BIRD SQUAWKS] 
 [WHISPERING] 
 Korsak? 
 Hey. 
 Korsak? 
 Korsak? Come on. 
 [BUSHES RUSTLING] 
 [GRUNTS] 
 Stay down! Stay and put your hands on your head now! 
 It's me. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 I was chasing Hoyt. 
 What do you mean, chasing Hoyt? How'd you even know he was here? 
 Korsak : Rizzoli. 
 Korsak? 
 Korsak : Hello. Little help over here. 
 Officer down. 
 Officer down. 
 Jane : Korsak. 
 Korsak : Officer... 
 Hang on. Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What are you...? 
 Officer down. Officer down. 
 Dean : Give me that. 
 Frost :  What's your location? 
 Dean : On the other side of the creek. 
 He snuck up on me. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Are they coming? 
 Yes, they're coming. 
 Okay. Okay. It's gonna be fine. 
 Korsak : I'm sorry. 
 Dean : Let's go. 
 Frost :  Push the ambulance here. Quick. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Guess where I've been. 
 How's Korsak? 
 Fine. 
 No, he's not fi... He'll be fine. 
 You told Dean where we were, didn't you? 
 I did. 
 Without telling me? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Really? You're sorry? Because I treated a senior federal agent like a perp. 
 I tackled him, Maura. In a creek. 
 Well, that's unfortunate. 
 But there's a fine line between courage and stupidity. 
 Yeah, a fine, thin blue line. 
 [BARKS] 
 Thank you. What? You have a turtle. 
 Tortoise. 
 Whatever. 
 Well, at least give her a bath. 
 Maura : Did you actually tackle him? 
 Yes, like a linebacker. 
 Very professional. 
 That's... Wow. 
 You've very brave. 
 No. I'm simply tired of being afraid. 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 How did you get past Frost? 
 He didn't. 
 Thank you so much. 
 If you're looking for an apology... 
 I would know to look elsewhere. 
 Fine, okay, I'm sorry. 
 Would you like coffee? 
 Sure. That'd be great. 
 Your place is really nice. 
 You sound surprised. 
 [JO FRIDAY BARKS] 
 What? Like I live in a sterile little hovel with my dead plants and my TV dinners? 
 So... question... why did Hoyt come after you? 
 Hoyt's first victim was mine. 
 And in case you hadn't noticed... 
 ...I seem to be Hoyt's favorite type: female. 
 Oh, yeah, I noticed. 
 What happened to your hands? 
 Why are you so interested in this case? 
 That's need-to-know. 
 Seriously? You fed guys actually say that? 
 [DEAN SIGHS] 
 I bet you never even once considered leaving the force, did you? 
 Sure, I did. 
 When Hoyt had me pinned to the floor and a scalpel to my throat. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 Hey! 
 [SOBBING] 
 And now there are two of them. 
 Hunting me down like a pack of wolves. 
 [SIGHS] 
 You want me to stay? 
 Hmm? 
 No. 
 No. 
 I mean, I don't mean no, I mean, no. 
 Like, no. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Well, thank you for the coffee. 
 Mm-hm. 
 All right. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 Good night. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 [SIGHS] 
 "No"? 
 [CELL PHONE RINGING EERIE MUSIC] 
 God, Ma, give it a rest. 
 Oh. Have you been here all day? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, good. 
 More caffeine. 
 [CELL PHONE RINGING EERIE MUSIC THEN JANE GROANS] 
 Uh, what's my ringtone? 
 [CELL PHONE PLAYING OMINOUS MUSIC] 
 Nice and upbeat. 
 Ha, ha. 
 You should talk to your mom. 
 She's mad at me. 
 I won't come home and sleep in my pink canopy bed. 
 Mm, I always wanted a pink canopy. 
 I wanted a horse. 
 Please don't tell me that you always wanted to dissect dead people. 
 Okay, I won't. 
 I have to go to the forensics lab at Quantico tomorrow. 
 In the middle of this? 
 It's connected to this. 
 Right. Yeah. Here we go again. 
 Why are you part of the need-to-know loop, and...? 
 He's trying to kill me. 
 Jane, this case is a lot bigger... and it's far more complicated than we thought. 
 I want to tell you. 
 Great. Fill me in. 
 I've been ordered not to. It involves national security. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Jane. Jane. 
 Jane, where are you going? 
 I'm sorry. Am I being a little too loud for you? 
 Dean : Do you ever relax? 
 No, I don't ever relax. And you know what else? 
 I've had it up to here with your need-to-know bullshit. 
 Oh. 
 I've heard bullshit before. 
 Senator Sam Conway, chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
 Detective Rizzoli. 
 Sit down. 
 [DEAN SIGHS] 
 Where is this? 
 Kabul, Afghanistan. 
 Jane : It looks like Hoyt's work. 
 A war zone is a serial killer's paradise. 
 Our apprentice is a soldier? 
 When we started investigating these, they looked like war crimes. 
 So... 
 So you withheld crucial information... so you could watch dumb cops run in circles? 
 You can blame me for that. 
 It's a very sensitive investigation. 
 We believe the apprentice finished his tours... came to Boston to find Hoyt. 
 So they could kill together. 
 That's what it looks like. 
 What...? Wait, no. 
 If our apprentice was a soldier, we'd have gotten a hit... on his fingerprints or his DNA in the military database. 
 We didn't get a hit. 
 You ever heard of sheep dipping? 
 No. 
 That's when the CIA borrows a soldier for a black-ops mission. 
 Green Berets were sheep-dipped. Their identities wiped from databases... so they wouldn't be recognized as American military. 
 So you think our apprentice was a Green Beret working for the CIA? 
 Yes. 
 [JANE SIGHS] 
 We train our men to be killers, and we're surprised when they are. 
 I hate that he's a soldier. 
 No, that's it. 
 That's the connection. 
 What? 
 It wasn't in the file. 
 Hoyt used an assumed name... to get into a combat medic training program at Fort Stewart. 
 That has to be where they met, right? 
 Yeah, that's worth a shot. Let's fly to Fort Stewart. 
 And cross-reference Hoyt's records. We'll nail both these sons of bitches. 
 Uh, did you eat dinner? 
 I can't remember. 
 Well, are you hungry for food? 
 Um... 
 Agent Dean? 
 Excuse me. 
 Yeah. 
 [CELL PHONE RINGING OMINOUS MUSIC] 
 What is it, Maura? 
 Maura : Jane. 
 I'm in your apartment. 
 Why? 
 Jane, they've been in here. 
 I'll be right there. 
 [CELL PHONE RINGING] 
 Yeah? 
 Dean :  Jane, you were right. 
 Called in a favor, got records from Fort Stewart. 
 Our apprentice is Special Forces officer John Stark... 
 ... 32. He did three tours... 
 ...in Afghanistan as part of a direct action force. 
 What unit was he assigned to? 
 Six-one-eight, medical care specialists. 
 Oh, my God, that's the same as Hoyt. 
 Stark lives at 400 Chestnut Hill Square. I'm already sending units. 
 Okay, uh, I'll get there as soon as I can. 
 Man : Detective Rizzoli. 
 Yeah. 
 Dr. Isles asked if you'd ID the body. 
 What body? 
 Sorry, thought you knew. 
 Dr. Isles said it was your neighbor. Young female, 20s. 
 Marisa? 
 Oh, God, no. 
 No, come on. No, no. 
 Hoyt : Hello, Jane. 
 [JANE GROANS] 
 So nice to see you. 
 You looking for this? 
 You know, your problem... is that your heart... rules your head. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [JANE GROANS] 
 Where's your little helper? 
 He's getting ready for our final game. 
 And I'm so happy to finish what we started. 
 [JANE WHIMPERING] 
 Take a look. 
 [DOOR SLAMS] 
 Hoyt : Oh, Jane. 
 You miss me? 
 [TASER POWERING UP] 
 Hoyt : What the? 
 [HOYT SCREAMING] 
 [TASER ZAPPING] 
 [HOYT GROANING] 
 Stark : Dr. Hoyt? 
 [GRUNTING] 
 Come on. Charge, damn it. 
 Charge. 
 Stark : Dr. Hoyt. 
 Dr. Hoyt. 
 Dr. Hoyt? 
 [SCREAMS] 
 [JANE PANTING] 
 [HOYT GRUNTING] 
 [HOYT GRUNTS] 
 [PANTING] 
 We match. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [SIREN WAILS] 
 [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] 
 [CAMERA CLICKING] 
 Dean : Hey. 
 Heard you got second-degree burns. 
 Yeah, flares are hot. 
 Huh. Yeah. 
 [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
 Stark was a decorated soldier. Makes me sick. 
 Hoyt kills three people... so Stark can waltz in and hide him in a body bag. 
 Hmm. 
 You gotta be hungry now. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Dean : So? 
 I just wanna go home. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 I'll see you. 
 Yeah, see you. 
 Thank you, though. 
 Sure. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I wanted you to see for yourself what extraordinary creatures these are. 
 Uh, thanks. 
 I thought you might need some help cleaning up. 
 Yeah. 
 [JANE GRUNTS] 
 All right, um... 
 Let me get you some work clothes. 
 These are my work clothes. 
 Ha, ha. 
 What? You don't like? 
 Oh. They're kind of cute when they're small. 
 I told you. 
 So where do you want me to start? 
 Come on. 
 What? 
 Let's go get a bloody mary. 
 We always said that we need to do something outside of a crime scene. 
 This is a crime scene. 
 Let's go. 
 Oh. Great. Heh. 
 Uh, but dressed like that? 
 These are my going-out clothes. 
 Oh. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 Come on. 
 [JO FRIDAY BARKS] 
 Keep going. Go on, go on.
