 [ Birds chirping ] 
 Can't believe I let you talk me into this. 
 It's good for you. 
 Taking a dirt bath seems sort of, I don't know, unhealthy. 
 It's clay, not dirt. 
 75% American Colloid HPM-20 and 25% Western Bentonite from Utah. 
 Oh, it's from Utah. 
 Well, why didn't you say so? 
 Spending 80 bucks to be submerged in Utah dirt is still a waste of money. Clay. 
 The first recorded use of a medicinal clay bath was in Mesopotamia. 
 It's my gift to you. 
 Next time, just give me the cash. 
 It's a wonderful way to... To eliminate toxic substances. 
 How? I'm up to my neck in toxic substances. 
 Well, hydrate with the lemon water. 
 It's very important. 
 I'm hungry. 
 Mnh-mnh. No, no. 
 Heavy burden on the metabolism. 
 Gee, I'm having so much fun. 
 I can't remember the last time I had so much fun Shh. You did not just shush me. An inability to relax could result in a dangerous buildup of cortisol. I want you to understand something. I don't like being shushed. My mother shushes. Okay, can you please stop talking? Same as shushing. [ Sighs ] Okay, that's good. Let's go do something else. Come on. How do I get out? Jane. Maura. Help!! Somebody help me! She needs a doctor! Oh. Oh-oh. Oh. Somebody stabbed her. Call 911. Okay. Did you get a look at the person who stabbed her? No, he was too far away. She's not breathing. No pulse. Was she conscious when you found her? She was moaning, yeah. When did she stop making sounds? A few minutes ago. [ Zipper clicking ] My God, she's gone. She bled out. She's pregnant. [ Gasps ] Start CPR. On her? She's dead, Maura. What about the baby? Just do it. It's the only way to keep the baby alive. I need a knife. Yeah, yeah, I got it. I got a Swiss army knife here. Keep doing that. Is this helping? You're pumping what's left of her oxygenated blood to the baby. Where's Boston e.M.S.? They said three minutes. How much time do we have? Baby's stopped moving. Seconds. I need your hands. Take over CPR. What? Do it. Right here, right here. Okay, tell me what to do. Once I fully incise the abdomen, I need you to hold it open so I can get to the uterus. Okay. Ugh. Keep going. Ugh. I need towels... Warm towels! Ugh. Wide as you can. I've only done one c-section. That's one more than me. Okay, once I cut the fundus, there's gonna be a gush of amniotic fluid. Just keep the abdomen retracted. Okay. Put them right there. Okay. [ Siren wails ] I've got its head. Be ready. Come on, baby. Come on. [ Siren chirps ] Get them in here. Go on! Okay. It's a boy. He's approximately 34 weeks. Why isn't he crying? Why are his lips so blue? He's cyanotic. Okay. Use it to tie off the umbilical cord. Okay. Tighter. Mm-hmm. Good. We've got to stop the blood loss. In here! What do we got? Premature infant, approximately 34 weeks. [ Baby cries softly ] Apgar was a 4 at birth, 6 now. I started infant CPR and got him breathing. Okay, we'll take it from here, Doc. He's tiny. Let's get him out of here. Think he's gonna make it? [ Sighs ] She had decent blood serum. That will help. Oh, what a tragedy. [ Siren wails ] A motel card key. Why was she in her pajamas? Maybe she had a craving. Oh, yeah, she's out trolling for pickles. 40% of pregnant women crave something sweet, actually. Poor baby. His mother's dead. Yeah, but he has a life, okay? And we're gonna find him a family. All right? Heavy layer of brush and dry ground didn't leave us any chance of finding footprints. What about missing persons? Any luck on the card key? Demagnetized. I'm on with their corporate office. No missing persons match our Jane Doe's description. We got fingerprints off it. They've just turned up nothing. They're trying to tell us which of their locations issued it. I thought you were at the, uh, arboretum, at that spa place. How was it? It wasn't very relaxing. What are you doing here? Uh, just passing through. You're passing through brick? What's with the signals, fellas? What signals? You're both terrible liars. Have you talked to ma? She driving you crazy, too? Oh. Oh, yeah, I got one just like it. That's so nice. She keeps coming over... My place is so clean, she's scrubbing the grout with a toothbrush. You should cut your mother some slack. She's going through a divorce. Hey, why don't you stay out of it, dad? [ Chuckling ] I'm not old enough to be your dad. Are you gonna eat that? It's bologna on white. Cut-up carrots and celery for your arteries. I want the chips. Hey, did we get photographs out to the area hospitals and ob/gyns? Yeah. Went out to social services, too. If she was at a motel, she could've been homeless. Oh, we got to find that baby's family. Angela : Jane? Is that you? Yeah, it's me, ma. Surprise! I'm so glad you're home. Now you can help me decide. I was, um, cleaning out the basement, and I found these cans of paint. And you know your father... He never throws anything out. Ma, this is my home. I know! Look. Marmalade, wild orchid, or begonia. What, you... you don't like any of these? [ Sighs ] That's okay... We'll get a different color, make it feel more like you. This reminds me of the time that I asked for a bunk bed and you surprised me with a pink canopy. I thought you loved that bed. I asked for a bunk bed because I wanted to build a fort, ma, and I didn't want to hurt your feelings. [ Sighs ] I wish you knew I hate pink. It's begonia! Then I hate begonia, too. Ma, all right. Ma. [ Sighs ] Aw, come on, ma. I want you to know, missy, I got stretch marks for you. [ Door slams ] Maura : Marmalade is the new black. If you say anything like that to my mother when you see her... Like what? Like encouraging or supportive, I will... You will... Hmm, well, Korsak will arrest you if you kill me, so you will paint my house wild orchid? Exactly. She was just trying to help. No, she's trying to find something to do with her life. What is that? Broccoli particulates, salmon. I can't tell if it's farmed or wild-caught. Ugh, what a drag. We would have solved the case like that. No, the blue thing. What is it? Is it a pill? What is that? It's more teal than blue. You know, a stomach's contents are like someone's grocery bag. It's so revealing. It's my favorite part. [ Chuckles ] Gosh, mine, too. Except the intestines. I do not know how you can enjoy doing an autopsy. Well, I'm distracting myself to do this one, Jane. I'm thinking about that baby, too. [ Sighs ] Yeah. I called the hospital. He's still critical. I may go see him tonight. I saw him this morning. Really? Are we getting... What, cravings for pickles? No. Okay. One stab wound? Yep. Lacerated right pulmonary artery. Cause of death... Exsanguination. How long it take her to bleed out? 3 or 4 minutes. So she was with us 4 minutes after she was attacked. Well, might not have been the first time that she was attacked. I found evidence of healed fractures to the mandible. Someone broke her jaw? [ Door opens ] Hey, found the motel that issued this. Great. Let's go. I'll see you later, okay? Police! Open up! [ Beep ] Clear. [ Sniffs ] Lousy maid service. Good for us. [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] Looks like she was here alone, yeah? Yeah, looks like it. [ Sighs ] What do you got? Suitcase. And I got a purse. Wallet. Huh. Think she's Canadian? No, she's a local. Tracy Kelly. Tracy? She checked in as Mary Smith. Well, then Tracy Kelly is hiding from someone. Abusive boyfriend? Or a husband. [ Siren wails ] I'm female. Yes. Yes, you are. What's the fastest way to push this guy's buttons? Let's mix it up. You be good cop. I'll be black cop. [ Snorts ] Bold choice. [ Chuckles ] Sit down. Thank you for driving all the way in from New Brunswick. That's, what, six hours away? What do you do there? Commercial fisherman. You know who killed my wife? Where were you yesterday? Where the hell you think I was? On a boat off of Canada. Any idea why your wife was living in a motel under the name Mary Smith? What the hell are you talking about? She hiding from you, Hank? What's that supposed to mean, huh? Hey, hey, sit down. Sit down. We know you're upset, Mr. Kelly. We're very sorry for your loss. Oh, yeah, you look like you're real sorry. You can take some consolation in the fact that your son survived. I don't have a son. Your wife was 8 months' pregnant. She was carrying a baby boy. We were able to save him. You didn't know she was pregnant. No. I spend most of the year out at sea, so, uh... I'm sorry to have to ask you this, Mr. Kelly. When's the last time you had s*x with your wife? Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Answer the question. 10 months. Why don't you talk to the guy who knocked up my wife? Maybe he did it. Let's get a blood sample. Hey. Can you look at our suspect's blood-test results? He says he's not the baby's father. He's not. What's wrong? Nothing. [ Sighs ] Tell that to your face. It looks pretty bothered. Every person has their A.B.O. Blood type determined by each parent. Tracy Kelly's blood type is "A" okay. And baby John Doe's blood type is o-positive. Sum it up for me, Maura. His mother couldn't be type "A" Tracy's not the baby's mother. Tracy Kelly seems to have been a gestational surrogate. Is that the only possibility? Yeah, maybe Tracy can't get pregnant with Hank. Yeah, and decides to do in-vitro with donor eggs and sperm. No, no. She had quite robust reproductive organs. Do you find that sexy in a woman? "Robust reproductive organs"? First thing I look for. [ Snickers ] [ Chuckles ] Wait a minute. This is fantastic. Tracy was carrying somebody else's baby. Which means that baby John Doe has parents. Well, biological parents, not social parents. It's not the same thing, but... I was adopted. My real parents were the ones that raised me. You know, nature/nurture, biological/social. Either one is fine with me, as long as we find a loving mommy and daddy for that baby. Okay, look at Tracy's bank account. $2,000 in cash deposits once a month. For eight months. $16,000 just does not seem like enough compensation for stretch marks. And why does my mom blame me? She had three kids. [ Chuckles ] Looks like it was a lot of money for Tracy Kelly. Did you find her medical records? Nothing so far. Her mandibular fracture was surgically treated by a closed reduction, so there should be records of that surgery somewhere. Korsak : Yeah, in Delaware. Tracy's name popped up in a state police report. For a domestic? No. Motor-vehicle accident. T-boned by a truck. So Hank didn't break her jaw. I got more... Vessel records confirm Hank was a mile offshore when his wife was killed. Well, someone with some kind of training implanted the fertilized egg in Tracy. I mean, it's not exactly a do-it-yourself. [ Chuckles ] The undigested teal capsule in her stomach had 1,000 micrograms of folate in it. That's a prescription prenatal vitamin. We find the supplier, we find the doctor they were supplied to. Mm-hmm. Hey, uh, how you doing? Hey. [ Clears throat ] You two dating? Look, your brother asked to shadow me. You know, gear up for the detectives' test. Why didn't you ask me? What, because he's a sergeant now? Will you stop that? I got promoted, but nothing has changed. Yeah, plus we got boundary issues. Yeah, boundary issues. What boundary issues? Come on. Hey, speaking of that, have you seen this? Ma's having a yard sale tomorrow. What? Oh, read the fine print. At my house?! Come on! [ Laughs ] Oh, hey. B.P.D. know you blocked off half my street? What was I supposed to do? Dad's having a competing yard sale at the house. What a jerk. Try to be nice? I'm always nice. What a fabulous idea it is to have a yard sale at my house. Why don't you just bring down all the horrible gifts I've ever given you? And you can just sell them. Come on, ma. I'm sorry. How can I help? Start pricing. Ladies, ladies, I specifically said, "no early birds." Woman : How much for these? Uh, $2. How about 50 cents? That thing is nicer than my car. It probably converts into a tractor-trailer. 2 bucks. What? What'd I say? You're not very good at sales. That stroller cost 300 bucks, easy. Uh, $1,049.99. Oh, and how do we know that? Maura? Have you been shopping for baby stuff? No. No, I was online, buying a necklace, and the baby store was just a click away, so I... I was looking. Well, stop. You don't have a baby. [ Sighs ] Yet. Trust me, I did a lot of babysitting. Babies aren't accessories. I do not think they're accessories. Do you like that? Well, it's... I mean, I'm surprised that it's... Surprised it's still here, right? That somebody hasn't snatched it up. Beautiful, huh? Yes. It's unusual. It's, um... Who's the artist? Me. Wow. It's a landscape. It's our backyard, and those are the two swings. I was gonna ask for five. Hundred? It's priceless. Yes. Let me. Hey. Hey. A lot of stuff. I know. Thanks. [ Chuckles ] Thanks, Maura. Hmm. What can I do? Um, you can take this to the toy table, over there. No. No! Guardian Chogokin. Oh, my God. I'll give you 100 bucks for it. Sold. Really, I'm not good at sales? $120. It's not I.T.B. "In the box." More valuable, the less it's played with. You know, he is a steal at $120, Detective Frost. Mm. Showoff. Thank you. Oh, no, no, no. Chogokin goes in the "keep" pile. Frankie, that doll has been in the basement for 20 years. It's not a doll. It's an action figure. Give me it, Frost. Whoa, whoa! I just bought this. Frankie, stop it. Frost, take the doll. Both : Action figure. Whatever. All right? We're here to help ma, not take a trip down toy Lane with you two. [ Cellphone buzzes ] Dr. Isles. Yeah, Frankie, help your family. Thank you. The crime lab just isolated the dyes used in Tracy's prenatal vitamins, and they were custom-designed for a fertility clinic on Beacon Hill. [ Indistinct conversations ] Pretty busy for a Saturday. Looks like there's a lot of money in making babies. Hi. Can I help you? Uh, yes, we're... As one of the fertility specialists here, I just have to tell you that biracial couples make the most beautiful babies. No. No, no, no. We're, uh... We're Boston homicide, and we are investigating a murder. We need to speak to your clinic's director, please. Oh, uh, Dr. Hanson... He's with a patient. We really need to speak to him. Okay. Follow me. All righty. [ Pages turning ] You want kids, Frost? Yeah, but I'm in no rush. [ Chuckles ] Tony Randall had one at 77, right? Yeah, but Tony didn't do all that much. I think it was more the 27-year-old wife. Yeah. Go, Tony. Ugh. Ugh. What's with the footwear? Mm. Thank you. I'm Dr. Hanson. How can I help you? We need to know if Tracy Kelly was a patient here. May I ask what this is regarding? We're investigating her murder. We have reason to believe that she was treated at your clinic. Oh. I'm sorry, I don't recognize her. Randi, my nurse, has most of the contact with our prospective parents. If you'll excuse me, I have a client waiting. "Clients"? Really? Do you recognize her? Uh, hmm. We have so many. S-she doesn't seem familiar. Her name was Tracy Kelly. She was 34 weeks pregnant. She was taking prenatal vitamins provided by this clinic. Huh. I wonder why she doesn't seem familiar. Maybe someone gave them to her? A lot of our moms give away unused stuff once they deliver. I'd like a list of your clients. Well, I'm sure you understand, our confidentiality policy means I can't just give it to you. We can get a court order. That would be best. And I am serious, biracial couples... Mmm... such cute babies. [ Chuckles ] Thanks. We're good. It must be hard when your children grow up. Well, they were the only thing I was ever good at. [ Chuckles ] Oh, that's not true. What, Jane said I wasn't a good mother? No. No, no, no, that's not what I meant. I-I-I just meant that you're great at lots of things, like cooking and cleaning. [ Chuckles ] You should see me with a baby. Hey, Korsak, want to be a godfather? Would you knock it off? Quit being funny like an hour ago. I've been working at home. I got good news for you... A match for the baby's DNA. Went through two color cartridges trying to print this out. Put it through as an informant fee. Yeah, and get fired? This guy... Mitch Tolliver, doing time for a felony. How is that good news that baby John Doe's daddy is a con Mitch is the evil twin. This is his identical twin brother, the good one... Jim. Jim's a teacher. He and his wife have been trying to have a kid. I was never able to carry to term. My eggs were fine and Jim is healthy, but I just kept having miscarriages. I'm sorry. [ Sighs ] We had nearly given up hope. On two teachers' salaries, we didn't think we could afford fertility treatments. How did you afford Dr. Hanson? He arranged for us to get a second mortgage on our house. Um, did Dr. Hanson introduce you to the surrogate? Yes. Tracy was a really nice girl. She called all the time, made sure that we had ultrasound photos. [ Chuckles ] That's our baby. That's James Jr. We, um, we were beside ourselves when the clinic called and told us that Tracy had miscarried. Mr. and Mrs. Tolliver, your baby is still alive. What? Is your mother... Breast-feeding. Your mother is the most wonderful kangaroo volunteer. I don't think I should be here. My mother is a kangaroo? Well, studies have shown that neonates thrive when there's skin-to-skin contact, so I arranged for your mom to be a volunteer kangaroo. And thanks to her, baby John Doe's vitals have stabilized. She looks so happy. I bet she looked that happy holding you. That's your son. [ Gasps ] That's him? That's our baby? [ Both sigh ] You can go in as soon as the court awards custody. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. [ Chuckles ] Congratulations. I can't believe he's still alive. [ Sniffles ] We have a son. They named him James Jr. [ Chuckles ] 
 
 [ Cellphone rings ] [ Sighs ] Hey, Korsak. Korsak : Jane, we got a problem. Detective Rizzoli, these are the Paysons. Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. Hi. They came looking for baby John Doe. We're his parents. I'm sorry, but we're going to need to do some DNA testing. Why? Because there is another family claiming that this is their baby, as well. Oh, you know, I can clear that right up. He's not our biological child, but he's ours. We arranged a legal adoption through dream babies. What were you told about the birth parents? That the mother was young and single and didn't have the means to care for a child. But, um, we do. We want to be parents. And then, when we found Russell, uh, our prayers were answered. Yeah. And how did you find this Russell? Online. In fact, most of the arrangements were made that way. We just met with him once to sign the paperwork. You paid $75,000? Half of the private adoption fee. We paid the attorney's fees and the mother's expenses. It's all legal. And you started the adoption process two weeks ago? Well, we'd been disappointed so many times. I just, uh, I just couldn't stand waiting anymore. When Russell showed us Tracy's picture, I... We were happy to pay. Yeah. Then Russell stopped returning our phone calls, and then we saw Tracy's photo in the newspaper. It's so awful. Uh, is the baby all right? I mean, is he, um... Is he with someone... Someone holding him? Where is he?! Where's our baby? Maura : Call me with the results. Just doesn't seem fair. All a blood test tells us is who baby John Doe's biological parents are. Well, how else are you gonna do it, King Solomon? You can't really cut him in half. Well, you could find out who would make the better parents. You got a test for that? Ugh. This is a mess! Who killed her? I can tell you who the father is. Jim Tolliver. Oh, good. He had kind eyes. Okay. But the mother is not Linda Tolliver. So, who is it? I don't know. And we're back to a mess. We know Tracy needs money. She has no skills. So she offers herself as a surrogate to Dr. Hanson. He implants an egg. Fertilized by Mr. Tolliver. And then "Russell the lawyer" brings Hanson the Paysons with their bigger checkbook. Hanson resells the baby. Huh. Check this out. Here's our Dr. Hanson. And here is private adoption attorney Russell Dempsey. Same guy. Huh. Doctor/attorney/con man. Good scam. I hear someone in distress. Hear that? That is so old-school. Don't you have any other tricks? Anybody smell gas? That's better, sergeant? Would you rather wait for a warrant, detective? Why don't we just go in? Police! Anybody here? I'll go check the back offices. Looks like they all got out of Dodge. Not all of them. Dr. Hanson. He's dead. Looks like he's been stabbed. He's not the only thing dead in here. Watch yourself. What are we stepping in? Somebody's dreams. A lot of people's dream babies. Same knife? Wounds are consistent with the knife that killed Tracy, but I can't be sure until I have the knife. Oh, yeah. I knew I forgot something. It's [ Sighs ] Maura, if I had the knife, I wouldn't be asking. This was a more frenzied attack. Nine stab wounds around the chest area. So, the person who did this was pretty pissed off. [ Sighs ] Can you imagine all these desperate people who want to be parents put their faith in this phony doctor? Crime techs have logged thousands of couples' sperm, eggs, and embryos. [ Cellphone buzzes ] Okay, I got to go to the brick. I'll call you later. Okay. Hey, your brother's really good at this. I had him go over all the video surveillance from the clinic. Yeah, I went through 2,000 hours of footage. Living the dream, Frankie. Yeah, well, I found the victim, Tracy, and the guy. You know who that is? Hanson. Whatever he's saying is upsetting her. Yeah, he's real good at this, Korsak. You mean because she's crying? You see why I didn't want to learn from you? Will you kids knock it off? Look at this. Hanson and our victim look like lovers. Maybe they were. Maybe that's why they're both dead. So, Hank was jealous. That's a strong motive. But you wouldn't know it from his e-mails to Tracy. Listen to this. "You're my heart. I miss you. I hate this job. I hate leaving you." [ Sighs ] What's Tracy gonna say? "Dear Hank, I got a job as a walking womb"? [ Chuckles ] Stop. [ Chuckles ] Oh, hey, oh, look at this. This was e-mailed to Hank the night that Tracy was murdered. Sent anonymously. You got any more for me to do? Yeah. Cellphone provider sent us Dr. Hanson's deleted voicemail messages. Start listening. [ Sighs ] I know guardian Chogokin is in your drawer. He's going for $500 on eBay. You ripped off my mother. He doesn't even have the sword, man. [ Sighs ] Okay, okay, you know what? If it gets you to shut it, I'll give your mom the $380. He wasn't for sale. Can you fight over the doll after we've solved this murder? Action figure. All right, Hank's got a good alibi. His boat was out to sea the day that Tracy was murdered. Vessel logs put it a mile off the coast of New Brunswick. Says Hank was on it. They give a list of the survival equipment? Why? What are you thinking? Commercial fishing boats have to carry survival craft. There. 16-foot R.I.B. with a 25-horse eggbeater. Well, thank you, Popeye, but, well, what does that mean? It's a rigid inflatable boat. A very fast motorized dinghy. He could've gotten to shore in half an hour. It's a 6-hour drive to Boston. Just enough time to kill his wife and then get back to his boat. You lied. You knew your wife was pregnant. You want to tell us what else you lied about? Look, I didn't say anything 'cause I knew it would look bad. Yeah, it looks bad. I waited for her at our house. She never came home. So I drove back to New Brunswick. You took a dinghy a mile through choppy water, drove 400 miles, and then just turned around when you couldn't find your unfaithful wife? Yeah, jury's not gonna like that alibi. Look, I know it sounds crazy... But I loved Tracy. I would have forgiven her. [ Knock on door ] Hey, can I see you for a sec? Yeah, sure. I must have listened to 300 phone messages. Do you hear me complaining? [ Sighs ] Hi, it's Tracy Kelly. I told you, I only did this so my husband could quit his job. He's the Tollivers' baby. Please, can you all stop calling me? She was trying to reunite with Hank. She became a surrogate to bring him back home. Why didn't she tell him? She might still be alive. Play that last part again. Please, can you all stop calling me? Who else was calling her? And why? I want to look through the clinic's medical records. Damn, there's a lot of women who want kids. Hmm. Men, too, Korsak. You know what bugs me about this whole thing? You know what it takes to get these eggs? Is this a trick question? Months of painful shots and surgical extractions. Well, the fathers go through stuff, too. What two minutes with a magazine? Hey, there's nothing fun about doing it with a magazine. Well, depends on the magazine, right? [ Chuckles ] Really? Really? Hey, Frost, remember that nurse we met... Randi Gordon, the one who said we'd make beautiful babies together? She helped herself to Jim Tolliver's sperm. [ Mouse clicking ] Is that legal? No. It's an employee 5-finger discount. Well, records show three IVF procedures for Randi at the clinic. None of them took. Frost : Clear. She was definitely getting ready for the surrogacy stork. Uh, Jane? Yeah? I think I found...Wow. She thought of everything. She faked nine months of pregnancy so nobody would bat an eye when she showed up with a baby. Okay, uh, let's issue a bolo on Randi Gordon. [ Dialing ] I want somebody watching that baby. Hey, where are you? Why do you ask? Thank God you're terrible at lying. You're playing mommy kangaroo, aren't you? Oh, how did you know? Listen, do not let that baby out of your sight. I'm on my way. Okay? No phones in the NICU. Oh, Jane, I have to go. Um, I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm a kangaroo care volunteer. [ Baby fussing ] Hi. [ Baby crying ] It's all right, yeah. Okay. I should feel a surge of prolactin. I think that's it. No, that's oxytocin. I'll take the baby. It's time for his feeding. Well, can I feed him? Let's go. We're gonna say hi to Jane. [ Beep ] Okay. Hi. Hi. You want to feed him? What's wrong? I'm... I'm just... I'm glad he's okay. Uh, excuse me, can you call your head of security, please? I need to speak to him. Here. You go ahead and hold him while you tell me what's going on. Maura... Come on, here you go. It'll help calm you down. [ Baby cries ] Ooh. Ooh. Oh. Ohh. He's so...Less blue. [ Chuckles ] Can you feel it? Feel what? A surge of oxytocin, the mothering hormone. Primates also secrete it during sexual intercourse. Maura. [ Beep ] Take the baby. Give him to me. Give him to me! [ Gasps ] No, please don't hurt this baby. Maura, don't. His parents wanted him so badly. They're not his parents! I am his mother! You used your egg and Jim Tolliver's sperm, and you... you watched that baby grow in... In Tracy Kelly's womb. I would have paid her. Tracy didn't want your money. She wanted the Tollivers to have this baby. That's when you decided to kill her and frame her husband. He's my baby! Give him to me. You planned on killing Tracy, didn't you? You're a nurse. You knew that you had 3 minutes from the time you slit her throat to get that baby out. My baby! Maura! I'm his mother! Drop it! Drop that scalpel now! I will shoot you, I swear. Drop it. Do it now! [ Scalpel clatters ] [ Baby crying ] Get security up to NICU. Now! [ Clatter ] [ Sobbing ] [ Woodpecker tapping ] Why do women fake pregnancies? All sorts of reasons... Pain over infertility, denial, attention-seeking. Couldn't believe it when you put yourself between nurse whack-job Randi and the baby. It was just... Well, you protected him, too. Well, I mean, I just... I never really saw you as the maternal type, you know. You didn't? Mnh-mnh. I've always seen you as the maternal type. Are you lying? Yes. I hope you get hives. [ Laughs ] The clay will prevent a histamine reaction. [ Chuckles ] Wasn't it wonderful to see Mrs. Tolliver holding the baby? She didn't care whose egg or sperm was responsible.
