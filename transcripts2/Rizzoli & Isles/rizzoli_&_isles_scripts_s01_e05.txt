 Hi. 
 You believe in love at first sight? 
 Immediate attraction is pure narcissism. 
 Oh, I don't agree. 
 Look, they're talking about his T-shirt. 
 Takes quite a lot of effort to attract a mate. 
 That right there is the beginning of true love. 
 People are attracted to people who are attracted to them. 
 Man : Oh, okay. Well... 
 [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] 
 Ha, ha! 
 Well, there goes that theory. 
 [CELL PHONES RINGING] 
 Something tells me we're not getting in much of a run. 
 Rizzoli. 
 Isles. 
 Jane : Hey, Russ, what do we got? 
 Rizzoli, how you doing? Got a floater. 
 Jane : When did you pull him out? 
 Twenty minutes ago. 
 How long's he been in? 
 Hard to tell once the body's been in for an hour. 
 Couldn't find an ID. 
 We don't need an ID. 
 Maura, you know him? 
 Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. 
 It's Adam Fairfield. 
 I was... I was involved with his brother Garrett. 
 Of the Fairfields? Was it serious? 
 I was 20. Everything felt serious. 
 Look at the back of his head. 
 Yeah, happens with drowning victims. 
 Most likely from getting struck against the rocks. 
 You wanna go with me when I notify the family? 
 No. 
 But I will. I owe him that. 
 Holy crap. 
 The castle in Scotland is much bigger. 
 Place on the cape is beautiful too. 
 Jane : You could've been a Fairfield. 
 How do we not know this? 
 Could you stop saying that? 
 Ooh-hoo! This is a Spyker. 
 C8 Laviolette. 
 There's 400 horses up under there. 
 I only seen these in magazines. 
 Garrett's here. 
 He's always liked the finer things in life. 
 Yeah, he liked you. 
 Oh, I should've known. Somebody with the mayor beat us to it. 
 Nothing happens in Boston without the Brahmin families knowing. 
 Right. Brahmins. 
 Upper crust. 
 Is that the manifest from the  Mayflower? 
 Look. Balthazar Fairfield. 
 Is that him? 
 Made his money like all the first families. 
 Right, from shipping? 
 Yeah. Rum, wine, slaves. 
 [MAN CLEARS THROAT] 
 They don't seem to remember that part of their history. 
 The Brahmins have been Boston's social elite for centuries. 
 They live conservatively. 
 It would be considered déclassé to flaunt your wealth. 
 This isn't flaunting? 
 Considering that they're billionaires, no. 
 Sumner. 
 Maura. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Sumner : Thank you. 
 I hear you're running the medical examiner's office now. 
 This is, uh, Jocelyn, Adam's wife. 
 I'm so sorry about Adam. 
 At least he was doing what he loved. 
 Uh, what was that? 
 Sailing. 
 I can't believe he drowned. 
 We can't be sure that's what happened. 
 We're gonna need a description of the boat. 
 Notify Boston Harbor and the Coast Guard. 
 Who are you? 
 Jane, can this wait? 
 No. 
 I'm Detective Rizzoli. This is Detective Frost, Boston Homicide. 
 Homicide? Why? 
 We look into all unattended deaths. 
 [JOCELYN SOBBING] 
 When was the last time you saw your husband? 
 They're just being thorough. 
 Last night. 
 He left very early. 
 Do you know if he was wearing a life jacket? 
 Never. He said he could sail before he could ride a bike. 
 Maura. 
 Garrett. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Detectives, I'm Robert Colburn, legal counsel for the Fairfield estate. 
 Thank you for coming so quickly. 
 Of course. 
 The family would like to cooperate in any way they can. 
 Get me any questions in writing and I will respond to them in 24 hours. 
 That's not really how we operate. 
 I'm sure you can understand the family... 
 Excuse me. 
 I flew in for the foundation gala. I can't believe it's gonna be a memorial now. 
 Maura? This must be Garrett. 
 I'm sorry. I was explaining to the detectives... 
 That it's critical we get statements as quickly as possible. 
 Isn't that right, Maura? 
 Well, I'm sure the family will answer all your questions as soon as they're ready. 
 I don't even have a cause of death. We should just give them their space. 
 Space? How much space do they need? 
 Yeah, maybe we can, uh, set up some interviews over the next few days. 
 Oh, hey. 
 They're not setting up interviews. Quit looking at the car. 
 Whoa, hey, that's not a car. That's a work of art. 
 Yeah, you're a tool. 
 Do you get tired in the afternoon? 
 Forget where your keys are, your phone? 
 Well, Polynesian people... are among the healthiest and happiest people in the planet. 
 Now, science knows why. 
 And it comes in a bottle. 
 How long's this been going on? 
 A while. 
 I got the two-bottle special. 
 Oh. 
 Korsak : Your mother's really a good saleswoman. 
 Frankie : Huh. 
 Angela : If you buy now... 
 ...I'm offering a two-for-one special. 
 It's an excellent value. 
 And if you sign up for a year, it's less than a daily cappuccino. 
 Come here, Ma. Come on. 
 Excuse me one second. My son. 
 What? 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm the authorized sales associate... for the Polynesian Anti-Aging Lychee Fruit Flush. 
 Did you know that Polynesians were among the...? 
 Since when are you doing this? 
 Since it single-handedly cured... 
 ...Carla Talucci's colitis. 
 Carla Talucci? 
 Yeah. 
 The only woman in the neighborhood who fell for the Nigerian bank scam? 
 Take a bottle on me. 
 Take it three times a day with meals. 
 It'll change your life. 
 Do you have to do this here? 
 The people here will be astonished at the change in their lives. 
 Digestion, bowel movements... 
 Ma. 
 What? 
 Just bring this to Jane. 
 Maybe it'll help both of you with your irritability. 
 The body of Adam Fairfield was found floating in Boston harbor. 
 Now, Fairfield was only 42-years old... 
 ... but he was the head of the Fairfield empire. 
 A collection of Boston-based corporations... 
 ... financial institutions, philanthropic groups. 
 He was also a member of one of the oldest, most prominent... Why are you doing the autopsy on a Sunday? Did they cancel all the kundalini-pilau-riku yoga classes? Kundalini is sacred energy work... pilau is a savory rice dish... and I'm pretty sure that you made up that last word. I'm not as educated as you and your deluxe friends. Thanks for the support with them, by the way. Their brother just died. I couldn't stand there and just let you badger his family. Badger? Wh...? Is that how you describe how I do my job? Since when do you rush the science? I'm not rushing anything. You're scrambling to finish the autopsy. The governor called. He would like the reports right away. Did you have a nice chat? Tonight, you could attend the opera with some senators. Afterwards go out on the veranda and smoke big rolled-up wads of hundreds. These people are not the enemy. Yeah, neither was Columbus. Tell that to the Native Americans he killed with smallpox. The Fairfields helped build this city. My grandfather was an ironworker. He helped build this city. Okay, so, what are we arguing about here? History or are you mad at me for who my friends are? This is about work, okay? I've just never seen you hugging suspects before. We don't even know what happened here. If this was an accidental drowning, there are no suspects. So you're hoping it's an accident. Are you hoping it was a murder? I'm doing my job like I always do. Why don't you do yours? I am. And as the medical examiner... it is my job to determine the cause and the manner of death. So I'll tell you whether there's a case here or not. Maybe I'll just figure it out for myself. [MAURA SIGHS] Frost : Ha, ha. This is great. What? Our suspects. Never seen so many rich white faces. It's Clue. Jocelyn Fairfield in the parlor with the knife. Their money goes back to Plymouth Rock. They made plenty enemies in the last four centuries. Check this out. The tabloids say that Adam Fairfield's marriage was on the rocks. What about his brothers? The victim was the oldest brother. You know, Dr. Isles dated the middle brother. No kidding. Makes sense, I guess. These people think they're royalty. Even though Adam was the oldest... ...Sumner, the youngest, took over the firm. Maybe Adam was a screwup. Not for long. He took over the business five years ago. What about Garrett, the middle brother? Frost : He owns a successful clothing company in Milan. Look at this. Fraud allegations against Sumner. That's why Adam took over. "Sumner Fairfield now finds fulfillment with hands-on work at a food pantry." Pfft. No one comfortable in a mansion... chooses to do hands-on work of any kind. Let's go talk to him. When'd you talk to harbor patrol? Two minutes ago. You were here. You tell them to find Adam's boat? No, I left that part out. I ran the company for six years while Adam partied and raced yachts. Story is he came back and took over because of fraud allegations? You don't know how the game's played. I never played the entitlement game. I played the South Boston game... on asphalt with broken bottles, used needles. Educate me. Adam got sick of clubbing, so I gave him a job. Next thing I know, board's accusing me of fraud, and he's CEO. Why didn't the business go to him? He was the oldest. He and my dad fought a lot. He waited until dad was dead before... Before what? Setting you up? Yeah, he set me up. No, these go to the Westerville pantry. How bad did you want to even things up? Fairfields will do a lot of things to each other, detective. Brothers don't kill brothers. Yeah. Where were you Saturday afternoon? Motorcycle ride. Beacon Hill to New Bedford. Beautiful day. Wanna see the gas receipts? Anyone with you? I ride alone. Come on. Westerville pantry. Wrong pallet. You guys are way off. Wasn't me. Adam was an experienced sailor. So he didn't just fall off the boat. Well, what do you think? Tom. I think I'd like to see a picture of Sumner on his bike. Cashmere. What'll this set me back, couple hundred? Well, those are from Garrett's line. The sweaters start around, I don't know, a thousand dollars. What's it made of, spun platinum? Uh, the downy undercoat of cashmere goats. Hmm. Oh, this texture should be softer. Must be from the sea-salt exposure. Or maybe the goat was getting even. Ha, ha! [BOTH LAUGH] That depression on the bone, what's that from? Oh, it's hard to tell. Maybe the victim fell and hit his head on the edge of the boat. Hey, doc, you wanna tell me why I'm really here on Jane's case? Oh, well, I thought I could get the benefit of your sailing experience. I got a Sunfish I throw in the back of the truck and take to the cape. Well, you know, it seems like the victim hit his head on the boat. Maybe slipped and fell overboard. What's your take? My take is that you are the chief medical examiner, this is not your first floater. It is my, uh, 43rd. Yes, my 43rd. I've been a cop a long time. I know when people aren't telling me the whole story. Jane's mad at me. Oh, boy. She thinks I'm being biased because I'm acquainted with the family. Acquainted? I heard it was a little more than that. It was. That's not it, though. When you grew up like Jane... you're gonna have an attitude about people who are entitled. That's prejudice. Where people like me and Jane come from, we didn't have a lot. But we had each other's backs. Sounds to me like all Jane wants to know is, do you have hers or not? Hey. So Ma's got a new job. Selling that. Ah, nice. Wha... Carla Talucci? Can you have the crime lab run a test on it? I just wanna make sure she's not gonna kill anybody. Ha. Yeah, sure. [FRANKIE SIGHS] What's up? Ah... Ma's wearing lipstick every day. She's bought some new clothes. Big new job hawking anti-aging potion. It makes sense. What if there's more to it than that? Maybe she's thinking about leaving Dad. Colburn : Detective Rizzoli. All right, I'll see you. Mr. Colburn. We subpoenaed a lot of records from the estate. I don't see you carrying files. There are sensitive international finances involved. We can't have those floating around. So the Fairfields are above the law? Not at all. We're giving our complete cooperation. I can see that. Look, I'm not fooled by your $5,000 suit. I know where you come from. St. Luke's Parish. Tough neighborhood. I've come a long way. Maybe too far when you're blindly protecting rich bosses. My father collected trash. I'd be doing the same if it wasn't for the Fairfields. Their foundation put me through college... and law school. They gave me a job. They let me rise to where I am now... They let you? I have assurances from the top authorities in the state... that this matter would be handled swiftly and discreetly. You got that? I will handle this case the way I handle all my cases. You seem like a bright young woman with a promising future. I'd hate to see your career path cut short. [SIREN WAILS] Had BRIC detectives go through 27 hours of security footage on Sumner's route. No sign of him or his motorcycle? Nope. Nothing. Jane's getting stonewalled by Colburn. Can't get near the wife. No idea if the wife even has an alibi. Can't talk to Garrett. He flew in from Los Angeles by private jet Sunday morning. After the murder. Preliminary autopsy report. Why give that to us instead of Jane? Don't go there. Evidence of blunt-force trauma, could've happened when he fell off the boat. Pulmonary edema from drowning. Stomach contents... were "unusually well-preserved"? It's odd. I was able to determine he had Belon oysters at his last meal. Belon oysters? Supposed to be amazing. What are you, a frigging foodie now? Well, they are prized for their unique tannic seawater flavor. I read about them in the weekly. Only a couple restaurants in town serve them. We could figure out where he ate. Any restaurant near a harbor? Maison de la Mer. Nahant. Hey, I like oysters. They fry them, right? What? No. No, no. They serve them raw on the half-shell. [GASPS] Come with us. I will. Thank you. Oh. Belon oysters served raw with a touch of natural sea salt. And the chef recommends you not chew them. Food you can't chew? You pay for that? [KORSAK LAUGHS] You see this guy in here recently? Can't say I have. Lot of that going around. [SLURPS OYSTER] Frost : Mm. Mm. Damn, that's good. Dry. Metallic. Delicious. You can't look at a dead body but you could slurp that snot down? That's what it is, you know. Oyster snot. Whoa. Receipt from a corporate card. Sullivan Control Systems. It's a Fairfield subsidiary. "John Hancock." That's hardly creative. Hey, pal, can you pull the order off this receipt? Sure you're not gonna eat that? More for me. Glass of Château de Beaucastel syrah... ...Mount Eden chardonnay, niçoise salad, DOS. Dressing on the side. It's chick food. Well... Heh. No, no, no. You're accurate. I do prefer my dressing on the side. Maybe a guy watching cholesterol. Over fine wine at a romantic, seaside restaurant? Maybe he loves his wife. Uh, Jocelyn said she didn't see him that day. So who did? Hey. It's got 24-karat gold flakes in it. Are you making fun of me? No, I thought it'd be fun to try. Will you run some tests on this please? What case? Is Jane's mother poisoning the neighborhood? Uh-oh. Sure. So you gonna try the chocolate? What are you so dressed up for? No reason. Is this an apology? For what? Oh, boy. Jane : Uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh. You ask her. Jane thought Garrett would tell you the name of the woman... his brother had lunch with before he died. So this is a bribe. Tell Jane that if she thinks that chocolate will induce me... to use my relationship with Garrett Fairfield, she doesn't know me well. Tell Maura I didn't realize I needed to bribe her with the Hope diamond... [PHONE BUZZING] My phone. ...to get... Oh, I gotta take this. 
 
 Jane : Korsak... You looked really at home in that world. It's where I'm from. It's not where I chose to stay. Well, what are you doing down here slumming with us? The same as you. I'm catching bad guys. I need the job. You don't. I want my life to have meaning and purpose, the same as you. Sounds good, Maura. I don't know what to believe anymore. I'm not even sure whose side you're on. Your form still looks good. So does yours. You still running marathons? Once a year. I don't really have time for more. Work's pretty busy. Is that why you're here? Please tell me you didn't learn how to lie. That was one of your most endearing traits. The investigators think that your brother had lunch with a woman before he died. They were hoping you might know who. There was a reason I based my clothing company out of Milan. I think I know why. We used to talk a lot, remember? Might've just been talk if it wasn't for you. You inspired me to take a risk... go out on my own, get away from the clutches of my family. And you did it. You got out. Sumner and Adam, they fought a lot. So, what, Sumner had something to do with Adam's death? No. Fairfields will do a lot of things to each other... but brothers don't kill brothers. You're not married, are you? No. I have to come back to Boston to run the business. I can't leave it to Sumner. He's a mess. Do you know who Adam was seeing? Would you tell me if I promise to be discreet? There hasn't been anyone serious for a long time. How long? College. [PHONE LINE RINGING] Jane (on phone) :  Rizzoli. Maura : Jane. Maura, I'm sorry. No, it's okay. Listen, I don't have a lot of time. Adam had a mistress. Vanessa DeWald. Why are you doing this? Because I have your back. I gotta go. Thanks. Miss me? Yeah. Rizzoli just called. Niçoise salad eater has a name. "Vanessa DeWald." Adam Fairfield's mistress? Rizzoli tracked her down, talked to her. Her alibi checks out. But she had this interesting tidbit: Adam was divorcing his wife. Rich guys have prenups. Jocelyn stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if Adam divorced her. Ouch. That's hundreds of millions of motives. [PHONE RINGING] Korsak. Great. On our way. Harbor Patrol found the boat. I'll call Jane. Excuse us, gentlemen. Boat was found in our waters. It's a federal investigation now. [JANE SCOFFS] It's a nice ventriloquism act. Yeah, I can barely see your lips moving. Our tow boat's on the way to take this craft. That craft is our crime scene. It's our jurisdiction. Move. You want kids? I would move. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Okay. You win. Blood on the boom. Hit his head, he got disoriented, fell overboard. It's an accident. I got his wallet and some sort of inhaler. He had asthma. Furling rig, twin helms, graceful shear, teak-capped railed, French. She's a beaut. Man, you need to get some. Jane : Yeah. This from a man who makes love to an oyster? I did a once-around, no scrapes, fender marks. Nothing docked with her at sea. Man, I'm cool, all right? I can admit when I'm wrong. Call it an accident. I wish I could. But it wasn't an accident. Adam Fairfield was murdered. The Mikrosil casting came back. We got a partial impression of the object that struck Adam Fairfield's skull. It wasn't the boat's boom? Nothing on that boat matches the impressions left on Adam's skull. So somebody planted the blood on the boom. That's the only explanation I can come up with. Wow. So the killer hides on Adam's boat. He waits until Adam is out to sea... he hits him over the head with a weapon... and then throws the weapon and the body overboard. But how does he or she get back to shore? Maybe a boat or a dinghy. Korsak said nothing docked against the boat. Then, uh, there's an accomplice on another boat nearby. It's a pretty perfect murder. Except that the imprints of the skull would match the weapon. Which is 20,000 leagues under the sea. Oh, ac... That's actually a reference to unit of distance. Leagues across the ocean, not depth. It's at the bottom of the ocean. Do you have a plan of finding it? Not a good one. Hmm. What? Well, there's just something about these fibers on Adam's cashmere sweater. I'm gonna have the lab take another look at it. Wanna get a drink? Will it have gold flecks in it? Heh. No. The cabernet here is chalky. Have a beer. It's cold. I don't drink beer. Right. Well, we know for a fact that it's a murder. And we have two solid suspects with motive. Wife because she didn't want a divorce. And Sumner because he's pissed at Adam for pushing him out. And Colburn who won't let you near them. [JANE SIGHS] Please don't talk to me about that guy. Okay, fine. You wanna tell me what happened with Garrett? There's not much to tell. [CHUCKLES] Oh, God. I loved that guy. Know when you're so in love you feel like you took some kind of a substance? Oh. That's just narcissism. Maybe. [CHUCKLES] By the way, I, uh, ran some tests on your mother's miracle juice. It's 98 percent water. The rest is sodium citrate, mono-potassium phosphate. Anything harmful? No. But there's nothing helpful, either. I should tell Frankie. Oh, I, uh, brought you a present. Apology or bribe? "The Fairfield family invite you and a guest to a memorial." Uh, Maura, this is tonight. Yeah, I wasn't gonna go. But you wanted access to my deluxe friends, Sumner and Jocelyn. I want you to be my guest. Won't I embarrass you? Probably. But haven't I embarrassed you? No... more than half a dozen times. [LAUGHS] "Cocktail dress required." Can't I just go like this? If you're going to embarrass me, at least do it in the proper clothes. Come on. I have most of my money tied up in charitable endowments, but not all. I feel like I'm at my junior prom. What? Okay, I think I'm getting a wedgie. Cover me. Just stand here. Oh, God. Can't you do this in the bathroom? What? No, it'll just take a second. Waiter : Champagne, ladies? Thank you. Thank you. Waiter : Champagne? Thank you. Mm. Wow, thanks. That is good. Lefèvre Brut. Oh! Can't get that at 7-Eleven, can you? Man, how much? How much? I don't know. Well, guess. No. A hundred bucks. Maybe. I don't know. Hundred bucks a bottle? Wow. A glass. [JANE CLEARS THROAT] God, no wonder it's so good. My mother would be trying to smuggle it home in her purse. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Oh. Can you hold this? Thank you. The results came back for the fibers on Adam's sweater. You mind if I just send this to Frost? No, go ahead. Maura. Wow. You look beautiful. Thank you. Remember my friend, Jane Rizzoli? Of course. You're both absolutely breathtaking. Thank you. Thank you. Usually, this would be a celebration. A big gala to raise money for Boston charities. Tonight, it's for Adam. I guess it falls on me to commission a painting of him. And the trophy we, uh, won when we were 8 and 10. We used to trade it back and forth. I brought it home for him. It's a lovely gesture. Mm. Excuse me. Maura : Of course. [JANE GRUNTS] Give me that. Just give it to me. Mm? I am hungry. Mm. Branzino with a meunière reduction. Oh. It's looking at me like I personally put the hook in. How am I supposed to eat that? Use your fish knife. It's next to the melon spoon. Second from the right. Hold it like a pencil, okay? Okay. Mm-hm. Use the tip to cut the backbone. Then you cut the tail, and you place it on the side of the plate. You use this edge of the knife to remove the skin... and place it at the head of the plate. There we go. Okay? Okay, uh, and this is how we do it in my family. Oh! [JANE CHUCKLES] It's okay. Just eat it. It's delicious. Why do they serve beef Wellington after fish? And why does everything have to be so juicy? Oh, that's interesting. That explains why their alibis don't check out. They were probably with each other. Mm-hm. Killing Adam Fairfield. Detective, a moment? After I talk to your pals about killing Adam Fairfield. Please. [JANE & MAURA CLEAR THROAT] You've wondered what I've been covering up? Now you know. They're having an affair. No kidding. But I know for a fact that they didn't kill Adam Fairfield. Oh, what do you got? We love facts. While Adam was sailing... they were in a suite at The Ritz. All afternoon. So we just went from two suspects to none. Actually, I think we may have a new one. I looked into that fiber for you. Good cashmere is 14 microns thick. This is 24. Subpar materials. Wha...? Why would Garrett be using cheap cashmere? Because he's broke. I called his suppliers. He's behind on everything. Materials, warehousing... manufacturing, packaging. Guy hasn't paid a bill in months. Wait, that makes no sense. He inherited a fortune. Looks like he burned through it all. And then some. Okay, just because his company's in trouble doesn't mean that he's a killer. I don't know. Maybe killing off your brother and inheriting the family empire... paying off your debt, turns you into one. But he flew in after the murder. Flew in from Milan? Frost, we can't get into that private jet manifest, can we? No, we can only track the plane. Looks like it stopped in L.A. to refuel. Got stuck there for three days. Engine trouble. He and the plane arrived in Boston after the murder. Can we prove he was on that plane? Takes, what, three days to drive from L.A. to Boston? Oh. You think he did it in the Spyker? Ahem. Maura, I'm sorry. You okay? I should've seen it. You did. There is a reason you didn't commit to him after college. There is a reason that you're holding back now. It's called gut instinct. There were clues. I couldn't put them together. You did. You did it subconsciously. The oysters. That's how I missed it. The oysters, and it was right in front of me the whole time. Okay, come on. I'll take it from here, okay? Look, I thought that Adam had asthma. But he was taking a drug to treat panlobular emphysema... which is why he couldn't digest food. He wasn't a smoker. That is great for him. The damage was caused by a disorder called Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency. Sweetie, I'm sorry. I don't know why you're telling me this. It's inherited. The illness that Adam had... all of the Fairfield children should have, but they don't. Because Adam had a different father. And that's who carried the fatal gene. Adam was a half brother. That's why he didn't inherit the business. He wasn't part of the bloodline, wasn't a Brahmin. Wait, why didn't the father give it to Garrett? He was next in line. Because they had a terrible relationship. Garrett always used to say he wanted to make his own way in the world. And I'm not sure he had a choice. And then that didn't work because he was going bankrupt. Garrett said brothers don't kill brothers. I think he justified what he did because in his mind, Adam wasn't his brother. It's motive, but it's not proof. Maybe Garrett didn't do it. Jane, he did it. And I think I know where the proof is. It's how he got from L.A. to Boston. Only one person I know could've committed a murder... one mile out at sea and still gotten back without a boat. A triathlete. Maura. You said brothers don't kill brothers. You knew Adam had a different father, that meant he wasn't really your brother. [SIGHS] Maura, come on. You know me. The murder weapon left a unique impression in Adam's skull. Like this one. It's the same pattern, isn't it, Maura? We found it in your trunk. Run tests. You won't find anything on that. Because this one is new. The one you used to kill your half brother is at the bottom of the ocean. Have security escort the ladies out. Step out of the pool. Colburn. I think you should step out of the pool, Mr. Fairfield. Colburn, what are you doing? You work for me. I work for the Fairfields. Okay. Here we go. Yeah, I'm not really in a champagne kind of a mood. Good. It's beer. Thought we'd celebrate the simple things. I don't drink beer. That's because you've never had my beer. Okay, well, can we at least drink it your way? Yes, we can. Let's get this right. Remember when you asked me why I was slumming? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Well, now you know. Okay. Cheers. Cheers. Jane : Mm. Okay. That's delicious. Oh. Right? Wait till you try a spuckie. Maura : I don't know what that is, but it sounds really...
