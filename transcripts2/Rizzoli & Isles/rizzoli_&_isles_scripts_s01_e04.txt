 Oh, that's fine. 
 Yeah, I knew the beginning part, so I felt good about that. 
 Mm-hm. 
 I didn't have enough time for both of the essays, but I still think I did really well. 
 I'll call you back. 
 I think what we're looking for in... 
 Maura : Okay, everybody, right this way. 
 Single file. 
 Oh, crap. 
 I forgot today was her annual Career Day dog-and-pony show. 
 Detective Rizzoli, these are the students from the Elizabeth Bishop Middle School. 
 Are we almost done? I've got a lot of homework. 
 Who here wants to be a detective? 
 They must all wanna be doctors. 
 I wanted to go to  Tween Beat  magazine, but that was full. 
 Okay. Well, welcome. 
 Over here, we have a shoe print from a crime scene. 
 So we made a plaster cast... 
 Was it a murder? 
 Uh, yes. 
 Awesome. Was it disgusting? 
 [COMPUTER WAILING] 
 What's that? 
 That's the shot alert. 
 The computer software can triangulate the sound of a gunshot... and find its precise location. 
 Gunshots at Boston Cambridge University. 
 What? 
 Awesome. Somebody else is dead? 
 Wait, no, Jane, I'm going with you. BCU was my alma mater. 
 What about them? 
 They wanted to be at some tween magazine anyway. 
 Let's go find your parents. 
 [CELL PHONE RINGS] 
 Speaking of parents. 
 What is it, Ma? 
 No, I can't. I'm working. 
 Your father left me stranded on the side of the road. 
 Just get in the car, Ma. 
 Ma, I'm sure he got stuck at a job or something, okay? 
 Why do you always take his side? 
 Here we go. 
 I'm not taking his side. 
 He's too busy to fix my car. 
 He's got so many other better things to do. 
 Can we talk about this when I'm not working? 
 So, you know, I never told you, but I'd be really good at solving cases. 
 Well, the forensic sciences can be quite complicated. 
 A little common sense goes a long way. 
 I've read so many crime novels, and I always know who did it. 
 Thank you, Agatha Christie. 
 Stay in the car. 
 I won't embarrass you. 
 Thirty years of experience says otherwise. 
 College campuses are like a foreign country to me. 
 You went to junior college. 
 That's like 13th, 14th grade. 
 Maura : Jane, you know so much. 
 Jane : So why doesn't it feel like enough? 
 [CROWD CHATTERING] 
 Whoa, hey. Ho, ho! You're trampling on a crime scene. 
 You got tape? 
 No, ma'am. 
 Go to my car. In the trunk, there's tape. Get it. 
 And tell the woman who's in there to stay put. 
 In the trunk? 
 No, in the car. 
 White female, approximately 20. Gunshot wound to the chest. 
 No vitals. 
 Barney Fife was first on the scene? 
 Yeah. 
 No witnesses. 
 Daylight. Thousands of students. No witnesses? 
 Hey, they're all taking finals, and look where she is. 
 You wanna go back to being partners, just say so. 
 Can you please get a gun dog and look through all the Dumpsters... trashcans and the bushes? 
 Padding for a laptop, but no computer. 
 Maybe she didn't have one. 
 Nobody really goes to college without one. 
 Maybe the shooter stole it. 
 Danielle Davis. Hey, hey, hey. Have her dorm room sealed off. 
 Frost : Look at this. 
 Maybe it's hers. 
 The texts have been deleted. 
 Get a subpoena to the D.A.'s office for her phone records, all right? 
 Round piece of plastic. 
 Get this to the crime lab. 
 No. No, no. 
 No, no, no. 
 You look like my mother, but she's supposed to be waiting in the car. 
 It's a tragedy. 
 She's somebody's baby. 
 How do you do this every day? 
 Okay. I'm gonna have a uni take you home. 
 It's senseless. 
 Yes, it is. Okay. Go on. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 [SOBBING] 
 Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 Just stand right here. 
 Right here, right here. Did you know her? 
 She's my best friend. 
 All right, when was the last time you saw her? 
 We had lunch yesterday at South Campus. 
 Okay. Is there anybody you can think of that would have reason to do this? 
 Does she have a boyfriend? 
 She wasn't seeing anyone. 
 I can't believe she's gone. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 No computer. Somebody's got her laptop. 
 Wonder what this opens? 
 Her locker at the gym. 
 I'm Lucas Bilton. 
 I was Danielle's R.A. 
 Resident adviser. 
 They look after kids in the dorm. 
 How well did you know her? 
 Not that well. 
 She ever come by and talk to you about having a problem with anybody? 
 She stopped by once or twice about classes. 
 She was usually either studying or playing soccer. 
 Jane : Here's my card. 
 If you think of anything, would you give me a call, please? 
 I'm Danielle's father. 
 She wanted to get into BCU since she was a little kid. 
 Day she found out was the best day of her life. 
 When was the last time you spoke to your daughter? 
 Two days ago. 
 She sounded pretty tired, but she had a lot on her plate. 
 Straight-A student. Played Division I soccer. 
 They recruited her. Full scholarship. 
 You must've been very proud of her. 
 Her mother and I were very proud, yeah. 
 Her mother died when she was 15. 
 I didn't know how I was gonna be able to afford to send her. 
 She did it all herself. 
 [SOBS] 
 Would you like one of my officers to drive you home? 
 I just want you to find out who did this to my baby. 
 Two-centimeter singular gunshot wound, mid-chest. 
 I bet we're looking for a 9 mm. 
 I'll have Ballistics confirm. I just like to guess. 
 And I'm usually right. 
 Gunned down at one of the best universities in the country. 
 I loved every minute there. 
 Well, maybe not protein biochemistry, but... 
 Shooter was close. 
 Found a hair on her body. 
 Give it to the crime lab, see if they find DNA. 
 Okay. 
 Oh. 
 Well-developed quadricep femoris. 
 She was a Division I soccer player. 
 Did you play sports? 
 Ballet and fencing. 
 Those aren't sports. 
 Yes, they are. 
 What did you play? 
 Field hockey. I was an attacker. 
 I'm sure you were very aggressive. 
 Attacker is a position. 
 Maura... 
 She died from a gunshot wound to the chest. 
 Since when is the chest bone connected to the ankle bone? 
 The anterior inferior tibiofibular syndesmotic ligament is ruptured. 
 Sounds painful. 
 Probably hurt her to walk. 
 It's an unusual injury. You see it in professional athletes. 
 Her doctors missed it. She needed surgery. 
 Then how was she playing Division I soccer? 
 She wasn't. 
 She wasn't playing soccer on this ankle for a while. 
 So our scholar athlete was lying. 
 Why? 
 Girl 1 : Over here. I'm open. 
 Girl 2 : Don't shoot! 
 [CHEERING] 
 Frost : Wow, she was a talented player. 
 Danielle was my game girl. 
 No attitude. Hard worker. 
 Was she having problems with any of her teammates? 
 No, not that I know of. 
 Her biggest problem was a high-ankle sprain. 
 It actually wasn't a sprain. It was a torn major ligament. 
 Oh. No wonder it didn't respond to rehab. 
 Could you tell us where her locker is? We'd like to look inside. 
 Not ours. We have combo locks. 
 Jane : Hm. 
 If you think of anything helpful, please give us a call. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 I really liked her. 
 It killed me to have to pull her scholarship. 
 Wait, you cut her from the team when she got hurt? 
 And pulled her scholarship? 
 My hands were tied. 
 Were they kicking her out? 
 No. Her tuition was paid off. 
 How is that possible? The scholarship was pulled. 
 Straight from the bursar's office. Paid it off herself in lump sum. 
 Holy cr... Fifty-seven thousand dollars a year? 
 Includes room and board. 
 That should include an all-expense-paid trip around the world. 
 Hell of a lot of money to wear a toga and do Jell-O shots. 
 Right? 
 Where'd you go to college, Korsak? 
 Didn't. Watched  Animal House  a few times. 
 Of course you did. 
 Got something, Jane. 
 That was a good place to kill someone. Camera's blocked. 
 Suspect knows the campus. What about the security officer? 
 Barney Fife? Clean. No record. 
 The cell-phone company came back with Danielle's texts. 
 All that money for school, and that's how she writes? 
 "2GTBT"? 
 "Too good to be true." It's called texting. 
 It's so complicated, my mother does it in a nursing home. 
 Frost : I'm looking at her pages. 
 This looks like more than a friend. 
 Who's "B-Bear"? 
 There's a lot of texts from this guy. 
 Korsak : "Miss you." 
 "Love you, babe." 
 "Call me." 
 Frost : B-Bear. Brandon Lewis. 
 Sophomore. 
 Why didn't Natalie tell me that Danielle had a boyfriend? 
 Because they broke up a month ago. 
 Why? 
 He was stressing her. 
 What do you mean? 
 She said she didn't have time for a boyfriend. 
 And how did he feel about that? 
 Brandon's a good guy. 
 But? 
 It was pretty sudden. He was pissed. 
 I don't understand. She had even less time when she was playing soccer. 
 How did you know she was cut? 
 How did you know? 
 She told me. 
 She was really sad. 
 She said she felt like she lost herself. 
 Why didn't you tell me about this? 
 She didn't want her dad to know. 
 Was she sad about breaking it off with Brandon? 
 Ever since she got hurt playing soccer, she was sad about everything. 
 Uh, Boston Homicide. 
 Brandon Lewis here? 
 I thought this was a frat house. 
 We're getting ready for a party. 
 In the middle of the day? 
 We just finished finals. 
 Congratulations. 
 Excuse us. 
 Think their parents know they're spending $1000 an hour... for them to dress in foil? 
 Hi. Could you get Brandon Lewis for us, please? 
 Thank you. 
 Okay, why are you wearing this? 
 ABC party. 
 "Anything but clothes." 
 Brandon : Hey. 
 Jane : You Brandon? 
 Yeah. Is this about Danielle? 
 I'm not some gangbanger. 
 I'm prelaw. 
 We'll try to keep that in mind. 
 When did you and Danielle break up? 
 She broke up with me a month ago. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 Dig a little. 
 Prelaw. Must be teaching you some analytical skills. 
 I said, I don't know. 
 Was she seeing someone else? 
 No. 
 Why? Do you know something? 
 Come on, Brandon. 
 Girl that looked like Danielle, they're not alone very long. 
 How would you feel if she was seeing someone? 
 Really happy. What do you think? 
 I think a man gets enraged... and he does things that he regrets. 
 I'm not some homicidal maniac. 
 I loved her. Why would I kill her? 
 I don't know, Brandon. Why would you? 
 You can't pin this on me. 
 I want a lawyer. 
 Took him long enough. 
 Is this from the good fridge or the dead-people fridge? 
 Cold air is cold air. 
 How old is it? No, don't tell me. I'm too hungry. 
 [MUFFLED GAG] 
 I was at BCU. 
 The sorority girls were dressed in foil. 
 The ABC party. Such a Rho Zeta Theta thing. Heh, heh, heh. 
 You take it for granted that you know that. 
 I didn't know "attacker" was a position. 
 A gaping hole in your education. 
 I try not to have regrets... but, I don't know, when I was on that campus, I... 
 I felt like I missed out. 
 Jane, you're a bright, accomplished woman. 
 I peeked in the library. 
 All the things I could've known if I'd gone to college. 
 Something about being there was... 
 It was inspiring, you know? 
 You know more about human beings than anyone. 
 Bad human beings. 
 We're all a mix of good and bad. 
 [CELL PHONE RINGS] 
 Hey, Ma. What is it now? 
 What's this? 
 Well, your father wouldn't help me, so I traded in my car. 
 Were you semiconscious at the time? 
 Don't be condescending. 
 Oh, wow, it's a 429-cubic-inch V-8. 
 It's a very efficient engine, for its time. 
 Forty years ago. What...? 
 Is this about teaching Pop some lesson? 
 Well, that may have been part of it. 
 [MAURA COUGHS] 
 Smoke is leaking from your valve-cover gasket. 
 I can replace that for you, but I do see some other problems. 
 You're burning oil. 
 I would suspect it's a ring job. 
 How much? 
 Three. Maybe 4. 
 Hundred? 
 Thousand. 
 Ah! 
 Oh, God. Your father is gonna kill me. 
 Tell him not to do it while I'm on call. 
 Can you help me get the Buick back? 
 They're crooks, and you're a police officer. 
 I'm a homicide detective, Ma. What...? 
 Are you planning on killing the car dealer? 
 I might. 
 Is it drivable? 
 Maybe a few miles. 
 Fine. Let's call you a cab. 
 Frost : Hey, hey. 
 I ran down that barcode key we found in Danielle's dorm room. 
 You found something. 
 It opens a locker at a high-end gym in Somerville. 
 Danielle stored a nice dress... and... some "do me" heels in a secret locker. 
 Well, that's not her only secret. 
 Think I know how our innocent sophomore made $57,000. 
 Based on when she lost her scholarship and when tuition was due... 
 ...I'm figuring Danielle was turning tricks for no more than a month. 
 How'd she put that money together in a month? 
 She'd have to have some pretty high-end clients. 
 [JANE GROANS] 
 Come on. We're taking this. 
 Little undercover field trip to an expert. 
 A pimp? 
 Well, she had to be working with someone to make that kind of cash. 
 Can I drive? 
 Yeah. Knock yourself out. 
 Maybe Danielle had, like, a very rich sugar daddy. 
 Maybe B-Bear found out why she didn't have time for him and killed her. 
 Mm-mm-mm. I need me a little taste of this vanilla bitch right here. 
 How much for a party? 
 Three to five years. 
 My bad. 
 But 5-0 looking fine. 
 Get out of here. 
 [JANE CHUCKLES] 
 Leave it to my mother to trade her Buick in for a pimpmobile. 
 Okay, there's my expert. 
 He was a good source when I worked this sector. 
 Maybe he can tell us how Danielle was hooking up with her johns. Hey. 
 Oh, it's Rizzoli. 
 Who died? 
 Detective Frost, this is Mo Monee. 
 Your ride needs work. 
 It's my mother's. 
 Oh, damn. Mama's got some gangsta. 
 She one of yours? 
 I wish. 
 Girl like that could earn. 
 Maybe she had a pimp. Maybe you could find out for us. 
 She was a college student. 
 Well, it ain't like it used to be. 
 Bitches be tripping now, getting their own websites. 
 All kinds of amateurs up in this game. 
 Maybe she was solo. 
 No, if she was working regular, she had herself a daddy and a book. 
 You check her book? 
 We didn't find one. 
 She had a book. 
 This whole damn world's gone crazy, but ho's still need to keep a schedule. 
 Hello. You've got a great eye. 
 This one's in tip-top... 
 Okay, what's this about? 
 That is your car. 
 This is my mother's car. 
 Yeah, I'm afraid I can't do that. 
 That lemon you sold her needs thousands of dollars of work. 
 According to the law, we're not responsible for abuse... negligence or accidents once the car leaves our lot. 
 Right, law. 
 Hmm. 
 How about you showing me all your 140-58 documents... that shows you have bonds for these cars. 
 Also, let's get out your titles so we can verify the VIN numbers. 
 What do you say, Roger? 
 We want all our customers to have a satisfactory experience. 
 I'm sure we could rescind the sale. 
 Throw in a new alternator, all right? 
 I don't think that will be a problem. 
 And floor mats. 
 It'll be our pleasure. 
 
 
 
 I didn't think that you talked like that to anybody but me. 
 Is that mom speak for "thank you"? 
 [JANE CHUCKLES] 
 Ohh. Dr. Maura Isles, knuckle-deep in germy bar snacks. 
 I'm shocked. 
 Oh, I had representative samples tested. 
 Bacteria count fell within acceptable limits. 
 You want one? 
 Must be very complicated to be you. 
 You have no idea. 
 I had to get out of the office. 
 Me too. 
 I feel guilty taking a break. We don't have a lead. 
 We might. 
 I got the lab results back from that hair sample I found on Danielle. 
 It's synthetic. From a toupee. 
 Danielle was selling herself to a guy with a plastic rug? Ugh! 
 Maybe he took it off, you know, during. 
 This child at the college of her dreams. 
 She's turning tricks. 
 To stay. She lost her scholarship. She was trying to pay for school. 
 How about a loan? Hell, some people even flip burgers. 
 Not possible. 
 Why? 
 Because there are only 8760 hours in a year... and to pay for school, she needed to work 9500 hours. 
 You're defending her. 
 Your fancy French boarding school warped your mind. 
 In Europe, women make all kinds of arrangements with men... and both parties get what they need. No shame, no pimps, no victims. 
 I'm sure it was terrible to resort to that. 
 She had other choices. 
 Well, she didn't think so. 
 She couldn't go to her father. 
 Jane, what is it? 
 You're right. Her father was very upset... that he couldn't keep her in that school without that scholarship. 
 [CELL PHONE BEEPS] 
 You know that piece of plastic you found at the crime scene? 
 It's acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. 
 From a computer. 
 Danielle's missing laptop. 
 I bet the person who stole it dropped it. 
 And I bet the campus computer store can tell us who that is. 
 Wait, what are you gonna do? Sit outside and wait for it to open? 
 Yeah, I might. I'll see you later. 
 Anybody bring in a laptop for repairs within the past 24 hours? 
 Yeah. 
 Can I see the repair slips, please? 
 That's this morning's. 
 You need yesterday's too? 
 Yes, please. 
 Hey, Officer Kelly. 
 Get him. Get him. Get him. 
 Frost : Don't run from the cops. 
 Jane : Ohh! Look at this. 
 Come here. 
 Laptop-repair slip. 
 You wanna bet it's Danielle's? 
 I didn't kill her. 
 You had her laptop. 
 I found it. 
 After you killed her. 
 She was dead when I got there. 
 I grabbed it, put it in the cruiser, and then I went to call it in. 
 So your only crime is stealing from the dead girl? 
 Look, it stinks that she's dead. 
 But she's not gonna miss the laptop, right? 
 You're gonna miss your bed. 
 Take him to lockup. 
 Cheez Doodles or Chewy Bears? 
 So hard to choose. 
 You better have the protein bar, detective. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 You told me to remind you. 
 I think I found Danielle's hooker book. 
 It's on her laptop. 
 That's her calendar. See all these entries? 
 I think they're code for johns that she was meeting. 
 Ahh. That looks like a college student making notes to herself. 
 Except she wasn't taking art history. 
 I don't know, maybe he's right. Look, she records historical dates... but always as "1700," "1800." 
 That's military time. Look at this one, "2100." 
 She was probably taking future U.S. history, right, Korsak? 
 Her texts to Brandon stopped about a month ago. 
 That's right when these entries began. 
 Look at this. The night before she died. 
 "Windgate Act passed by A.H. 2100." 
 Yeah, there's a Windgate Hotel downtown. 
 Maybe A.H. stayed there. 
 Wild-goose chase, if you ask me. 
 No one's asking you. I'll go, Jane. 
 Okay. 
 Frost : Hotel security footage. 
 That him? Bad rug? 
 Wild-goose chase, huh, Korsak? 
 Didn't find anything. Oh, except one of Danielle's johns. 
 But we're probably not interested... in the guy she was with the day she was murdered. 
 You've had your fun. I was wrong, okay? So sue me. 
 "A.H." is Professor Andrew Hilliard? 
 Frost : Hilliard sold his house in Cambridge last month. 
 Been renting cheap school-owned housing for the past few months. 
 Sold his house? 
 You think Danielle was shaking him down for tuition money? 
 Like she's trying to wipe away what she'd become. 
 Tell Rizzoli. She'll be delighted to get this creep. 
 [DOOR KNOCKS] 
 Korsak : Professor Hilliard. Boston P.D. We're coming in. 
 Oh! 
 Jane : Ohh! 
 Korsak : We got a deco. 
 Jane : Smells a lot like day two. 
 You gonna hurl again? 
 You want me to kiss him on the lips? 
 Glock 26. 
 It's the same gun that got Danielle. 
 Serial numbers are filed. 
 Why'd he kill Danielle? Jealousy? 
 Maybe. Then he kills himself because he can't live with what he did. 
 Except... 
 "Except"? 
 Except it's a setup. 
 Hardly any blood on his gun hand. 
 Yeah, there's none on the slide either. 
 This isn't a suicide. 
 Frost : Hey. 
 Hi. I'm going to the crime lab. 
 I'll ride with you. 
 Maura measured the entrance and exit wounds. Hilliard didn't kill himself. 
 He was shot by somebody right next to him. 
 His broker confirmed Hilliard's been withdrawing 15,000 a month. 
 That's 180 thou... 
 For what? 
 No idea. 
 But it's been going on for a year and a half. 
 So the professor starts seeing student prostitutes. 
 And somebody starts blackmailing him. 
 Yeah, but it couldn't have been Danielle. 
 She's been a scholarship soccer player up until the last month. 
 Korsak : Striations match. 
 Same gun killed Danielle and Hilliard. 
 Tracing this gun is our best hope of finding the shooter. 
 How? Serial numbers were filed off. 
 Just because your bright, shiny object can't do it doesn't mean it can't be done. 
 Hey, Maura. 
 Let's get to the university. Danielle's friends are throwing a vigil. 
 I wanna get there earlier. 
 I'd like to come, pay my respects. 
 Maybe help you look for the bad guy. 
 They like to see the results of their work. 
 I know because I had two years of forensic psychiatry. 
 It took you two years to figure out the bad guys were screwed up? 
 It's beautiful, in a sad way. 
 Just keep looking at faces. 
 Hello, detective. 
 Some turnout, huh? 
 Yeah, it's a tribute to the kind of person your daughter was. 
 We are doing our best. I promise. 
 Thanks. 
 [CELL PHONE RINGS] 
 Excuse me. 
 You got something? 
 Yeah. The numbers off the gun. 
 It's registered to Scott Bilton, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. 
 Jane : Bilton? 
 Lucas, the R.A., Bilton? 
 His stepfather. 
 Be careful. He's got three other guns registered. Okay. Thanks. [SOBBING] Murder weapon's traced to the R.A. That kid's the killer? Of course. R.A.'s keep tabs on their floors. He would know that she lost her scholarship, that she was desperate. So his part-time job was pimping. Wait till this is over. We'll get him when he's alone. Maura, stay here. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. The bracelet's the same as Danielle's. Natalie was hooking too. I loved Danielle. Anything I say about this remarkable person... won't come close to describing who she was. Gun! [CROWD SCREAMS] Drop it! You killed Danielle? She couldn't keep her mouth shut. Don't think I won't kill you too. [GUNSHOT] Jane, go. I got her. It's okay. It's okay. Here. Here. Lucas! She was a whore, and she was a whiner. Gave her 57 grand, and she doesn't wanna do it anymore? You work it off, bitch. Just put the gun down. We can talk about this. Or I'll just blow your head off. Frost : He's running! Frost. I'm with you. [SIRENS WAILING] Well, good to see you with your eyes open. It's good to be going home. How you feeling? My ribs are a little sore. Bullet was a through-and-through? That's better than most case scenarios. I know. Bullet broke two ribs, came right back out. I guess I passed out from shock. It just hurts to laugh or cough. At least you'll have a cool scar. Doctor said just two pucker marks. Oh, good. So then you can continue to wear foil bikinis. Heh, heh. Oh. Don't make me laugh. Sorry. Here. These are for you. Thanks. You're welcome. Let's get you out of here. Are you gonna tell my parents? That you got shot? Well, I think they already know. Thank you. I was really desperate, and... And it was really stupid. Well, everybody does stupid things. That stupid? Okay, no. Maybe not that stupid. But you're here. You get a second chance. When do you go back to school? I don't. I can't pay. And I can't do what I was doing, ever. Oh, here. What's this? Open it. Weird, huh? I talked to the bursar's office. They said you were paid all the way up to your senior year. How...? But... There's always leftover scholarship money for hardship cases. I argued that your case was a major hardship. Thank you. You study hard, okay? Yeah. I'll see you soon. Take care. So, what was it like working on a live victim? Terrifying. And exhilarating. Natalie confirmed your theory, though. Lucas had about a half-dozen girls working off tuition. Lucas was the company store. Fronted the money to Danielle. Maybe she found out he was blackmailing the professor, and he killed her. Yeah. She probably thought she could get out if she threatened to go public. That poor father. What he must be going through. I applied to BCU. It's very hard to get in to. I got in. Why didn't you go? Wanted to be a cop. What's the real reason? My father would've spent everything to send me there. I couldn't do that to him. Did you ever tell him? No. That would make him too sad. Well, I wonder what's gonna happen to Natalie. She's going back to school. What? Made a little deal with the chancellor. We keep a lid on it, they go back to school. On the university's expense? Mm-hm. Because, you know, if this got out, people might be judgmental. What are you gonna tell Danielle's father? All he needs to know... is that his daughter loved him very much. Aww, Jane. What? I think that's really... That's really sweet. Oh, gross. Okay, give me the wine. What?
