 ♪♪♪♪ [thuds] [heavy breathing] [both grunting] Take whatever you want. I have money. We can go to an ATM. Truth or dare? What? Truth it is. Do you know this girl? Do you know this girl? That's just your lock screen. Oh. Dang it. Oh, hold on. Say her name. I... I don't know who that is. Aah. Try again. Beth. Her name is Beth. You scared, Will? You feel powerless? Do I have consent, Will? I want you to think about Beth. Think about the music you played to drown out her screaming. The tears that filled her eyes when you held her down, when you forced yourself into her. No, please. Please, no. I'll do anything. [grunts] I'm sorry. I thought no meant yes. My bad. You didn't stop when she said no, did you, Will? [grunts] No, no. I didn't stop. I didn't. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt anyone. Please, I'm so sorry. If you ever do to anyone else what you did to Beth, I will be back. Call 911. Tell them you've been robbed and you need a paramedic for your leg wound. What leg wound? This. [screaming] Don't pull that out till they get here. It's gonna get messy. [Kids' "Sleigh Bells" playing] ♪♪

[snoring] [chuckles] [door closes] [exhales deeply] Your pants are over there. Oh, cool. Hey, man. I'm Evan. Harris. Great. Mm-hmm. Well, this is pretty weird. I'm gonna grab my pants. You want some breakfast? Popcorn is not breakfast. And it's 3:30 in the afternoon. ♪ I like to make money get turnt ♪ 
♪ I like to make money get turnt ♪ See you around. Maybe. Best first date ever. Wasn't a date. Eh. [door opens, closes] [phone chimes] What? Nah, I love it. You're making new friends. Oh, Ophelia. What did I say about hacking into my calendar to add your activities? Yeah, but I don't check my phone, and you do. So this just makes the most sense. That logic is absurd. With that being said, you have an appointment with the school counselor at 5:30. Oof. You want me to come with? Nah, I'm good. They're just gonna shout hypothetical punishments at me and say that I'm not reaching my full potential, which is crazy because yesterday I hit my 6-foot bong without coughing. You hit LeBong James without coughing? Mm-hmm. That's very impressive. So you're not worried about today? My parents are huge donors, and I have a perfect GPA. I still don't understand how you have such a high GPA without attending any classes. If you turn everything in on time and take all the tests, class is optional. Nope. That is not correct. Really? It should be. Class is so tedious. You are a ridiculous person. I have no idea what you're talking about. [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] It's so gloopy. [indistinct chatter] Hey. Hey, there she is. Hi. [exhales sharply] She forgot about the meeting again. No, I missed a meeting! I covered for you, duh, but what is the deal, girl? Honestly, it was just, like, a total brain melt. Is Mackenzie really... Is Mackenzie what? Um, I'm so sorry. I completely lost track of time at the library. You've missed three meetings this semester. Zen out, Mack. She lost track of time. Fiona, fill Jules in. Total crisis. The party Saturday is cancelled. Omega Theta's on social probation because Miles snapped a picture of Chloe Freeman's boobs. Like, who hasn't seen Chloe Freeman's boobs? Wait. What if we throw the party? It is absolutely forbidden for a sorority to throw a party. I know the rules, but think about how legendary this would be? Yeah. Having the party on home turf isn't such a bad idea. Right. It's definitely safer for the sisters, Mack. I guess that's true. And we don't call it a party. It can be, like, a Zeta speakeasy. We could ban social media. Right. Right, what happens at the party stays at the party. Oh! We should get a baby goat. Party mascots are huge right now. Mm-hmm. Fine. I'm in. Both : Yay! Hey, come on. This is going to be sick. And... and you know what? It is time for the rules to evolve. I already regret this. What if the national chapter hears about it? My mom and grandmother are legacies. They will find out, and I will... If we get in trouble I will personally take the fall for it. Oh, girl, I think your stress hives are coming back. Damn it! I have to go get my cream. Okay. Stay calm. It's Harris. Leave me a message. Well, that didn't go amazing. One more infraction and I'm out. I need some alcohol in my mouth hole, so meet at Beans?

Go, now. [groans] [grunts] Tight. [panting] Well, clearly, this wasn't me. [door opens, closes] Hey, buddy, you okay? Sorry about the chair. Save it. Look, I'm just gonna level with you, okay? I can't get kicked out of school. I totally get how the whole weed-then-chair thing is a bad combo in terms of good behavior, but I... really, I just... yeah. I want to ask you some questions about what you saw tonight. Could you describe the assailant you saw this evening, like his height, his build? Any identifying features? Yeah. I didn't see much. He was wearing a mask. He was tall. You know, large build. Not, you know, like... not Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson big. More like a young Mark Wahlberg. Young Mark Wahlberg. And he totally bolted soon as he saw me. Great. If you could just keep what you saw tonight to yourself. Yeah. You know what? I can do that. I just... I think it'd be fair if you do the same with me. Ophelia... Look, it seems to me that these burglaries aren't just a one-off. Could really send some people into a panic if they found out that they were all related. Could put a lot of pressure on you. Like a lot... Fine, I will not report you. You're a good dude, Barton. Step away from my client. Seriously? I thought I was getting kicked out. She's not your client. You're a law student, not a lawyer. What? It's actually all good, Harris. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna hold you to this. Okay, good to see you, Harris. Have you seen this? [scoffs] Please. Some rich white boy got his ass beat, so the school springs into action to find his assailant. Do you know what Dean Charles said about my boy Skinny Jeff who got mugged last year? Nothing. He didn't even sit down with him. What if it wasn't random? There are two frat guys. And another thing. Where is the article about all the minorities getting jumped? Wait, what do you mean two? Cone of silence? So after Barton ate sidewalk, I dipped into the alley near Founders Hall and dead-end into Tommy Cope, you know, the ass-clown in Omega Theta? And he is getting his ass handed to him. It was so brutal, Harris. I... I've never seen anything like it. Leave this alone, Ophelia. Promise me? This is not something your parents can buy your way out of. Okay, what makes you think I was gonna do anything? Bitch, please. Have you met you? Whatever comic book scenario you're playing out in your head right now, quit it. This is dangerous and stupid and crazy. Okay, I promise I won't do anything dangerous and stupid. And crazy.

She's on academic probation? Did you know this? No way. No, if she were on academic probation, she would've told me. Her scholarship would be in danger. This is serious, Kennedy. The whole house could get put on probation. Okay. I'll talk to her. Just please go take a shower. And a Xanax. Okay. Yeah. [soft percussive music] ♪♪ Something I can help you with?

Please. If I lose, this I will be a full six feet under. Okay. Um, I mean, haven't seen an earring in a... Barton, Barton, come on! Get your head in the game here, man. I used your bathroom last night. Maybe it's in there. You used my personal bathroom? Hey, this is no time to reminisce. Go check it. Barton! Okay, yeah, I'll check my bathroom. Jesus.

I must have forgot to put it on after I showered. Hey, I need to tell you something, but please know this comes from a place of love. I know what's going on. Okay. Let me explain because there's so much that you don't know and... I saw the letter from the school, Jules. The letter from the school. You don't have to cover anymore. I know about the academic probation. Wow. It's not really the reaction I was expecting. Jules, come on. You could lose your scholarship. I get why you don't want the sisters to know. I do, but why wouldn't you tell me? Is there something else going on? You know, I wanted to tell you so many times. I was just embarrassed. Girl, please. How many times have I crawled in your bed at, like, 2:00 in the morning, crying over school or Nate or whatever? Okay, how about I set up some house study nights? No one even has to know it's for you. Babe. Oh, babe. [chuckles] Hey Jules. Nate! You ready for the game Friday? You know it! Yeah, you're the man! Go Wolverines! Whoo! Both : Whoo! [chuckles] Have I told you how sexy it is when people call you the man? Well, keep how sexy you think I am in mind because I have some bad news. I'm not gonna make the party on Saturday. Oh, no. I got to go visit Tommy in the hospital. I totally understand. How's he doing? Not great. Yeah. Yeah, the guy who jumped him really messed him up. It's crazy, especially with everything that happened to Will Powell last month. I'm bummed to miss the party, but you know I'll be over later, right? [chuckles] Oh, God. I'm starving. Do you want some fro yo? Yes, please. Hey, will you promise me something? Of course. No more secrets. Okay? You have a problem, you come to me and we figure it out together. Deal? Deal. Okay.

We're the big white house on Wythe. Do you have a twitch or something? No. [bell ringing] Both : Ophelia, we need to talk. Oh, be serious. I'm just a law student. I can't help you if you get caught doing this sh1t. You won't even use a public toilet. You wouldn't last five minutes in jail, girl. Okay. I hear you. Oh, thank you.
