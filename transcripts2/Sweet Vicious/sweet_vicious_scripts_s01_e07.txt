 Harris, I got something you need to see. 
 Previously on "Sweet/Vicious"... Ophelia. Sending texts as his dead brother feels kind of twisted. [siren wailing] Please remain inside... I've been working on the article about the attacks. I know what it is. The plan is simple. Harris has a run-in with the vigilante while you're there. You're not the vigilante. [knock at door] I can't believe Nate showed up. Too crowded down there. 
Let's hang back here. [exhales sharply] I can't do this anymore. Jules, what the... Shut up. And then you raped me. Nate. There's something I need to tell you. I just wanted you to tell me what was going on,  and at every single turn, you lied. [indistinct voices] [somber music] Wait. Put your arms in it. Okay. All right. Okay. I wanted to wear it, like, cooler. [indistinct chatter] [growling] _ Put me down. Be careful, please. Who wants a drink? All : Me. [groans] Hey, um, what happened with that blonde? Oh, halfway through our conversation, she asked me if I liked Zedd. I just couldn't rebound. Wait. Why can't she like Zedd? 
I like that Ariana Grande song. No. Do not get him started on this. No. Thank you, baby. Mm-hmm. Ew, it's gross. You guys are so cute, it makes me sick. Come here, babe. Oh, so are you guys ready for the party? Do you need help setting up or... Oh, no. We are more than ready, okay? I even have an ice luge shaped like Party Steve's dong coming. Aw. Didn't they make one small enough to replicate yours? Don't even trip, okay? 
My dick is gorgeous. [laughs] You put a wig on it, it would look just like Penelope Cruz. Wait. Are you guys still doing "Hos and CEOs"? You guys realize you're gonna be the hos, right? Yeah. We're not coming to your party dressed like some tired-ass slutty secretary. It is 2015. #GirlBoss. Preach it, sister. Female empowerment makes me tingle in my nethers. I've been so crazy with finals. I need a night of debauchery. Oh, well, the brothers of Omega Theta are happy to oblige. [rock music] Hello. Ugh, I am death incarnate. Aw. Here you go. Oh, is that a matzo ball? From the deli... extra carrots. Oh, bless you. Have you told Nate you can't go to the party? [sighs] Yeah, he's bummed, but I know he gets it. Hey, I was thinking we should just stay home. We can have a movie night. No. You guys have to go, okay? It's gonna be amazing, and Nate will kill me if I take all of you down as well. [coughing] Sorry. Are you sure? Oh, my God, yes. Go. Have an amazing time. Okay, fine. I'll tell the girls. And, hey, keep an eye on Nate. Make sure he doesn't do too many shots of tequila. Yeah, no one wants a repeat performance of the Great Nate Griffin puking into his shoes. I love you. Love you! No! I texted you an hour ago to get up and get ready. No. You know what? No smoothie for you. You've been holed up here for a week. I know you're hurting, but you can't live like this. I'm not ready yet. I like it here. I'm watching my stories. You know what they say? All stories and no play makes Jules a dumb asshole. Fine. Let's do a takedown. Jules, come on. You know that we have to lay low right now. Then I'm... I'm fine here. No, you're not... whatever. Do you, because today is Opharris day! No, thank you. You didn't even let me tell you what it is. Does it involve leaving the apartment? Yeah, but it's... Okay. It is the anniversary of Harris' and my friendship. We met three years ago this week. He was the RA on my floor, and we both shared a vendetta against my assigned roommate. Her name was Malina. She had several emotional-support gerbils. Truest of nightmares. Wait. So this day involves Harris? Mm-hmm. The same person that thought that I was the vigilante? It's fine now. Everything is okay. And Harris feels really, really badly that he... wrongly... but also kind of rightly... accused you. Look... It's cool if you don't identify me as your best friend yet, but you sure as hell are mine, so, um, let me do what best friends do and make you feel better. [sighs] Tell me about Opharris day. Yes. Okay, so it starts off with pizza, obviously. Then we play Edward 40 hands on campus. Then we have a power-hour jam back here. Then we end up at Gainers and... I just realized that I planned an entire day of drinking for someone who doesn't drink. Great. Um, I can fix this. No, it's... it's fine. It sounds fun. [cell phone vibrates] _ Oh, what's happening with him? You guys were so cute at the art show. Yeah, I don't... I don't want to be tied down. [knock at door] I come bearing 40s. Hey. [chuckles] [door thuds] Yeah. How's she doing? Okay, um... Hmm. My article runs today. Oh, whoa. Cool. That... Yeah, that makes sense. 
So that... that kid, um... Chase. Chase Park. Yeah, him. They... they let him go. Yeah. So your article says... There's a vigilante on campus. So dope. I can't wait for you to read it. Me either.

I worry that you don't understand what will happen if we move forward opening a case like this.

I'm no martyr, but I'm worried. I need this. It's the only way that I can get better. Oh, brother, that is such a goyim thing to say. You need to talk to someone, talk about what happened to you, how you feel. Do you ever do that... go to group, and not just listen, but talk, say something, say anything? I promise it'll make you feel better. [coughing] Get it all out. That's it. Okay, okay. [panting] You're right. I need to go to group. Just, um, take a minute to yourself, and I'll...

We went on a date, uh, and he asked me up to his room for a nightcap after. When we got up there, he turned on the music really loud... so that when I yelled "stop," nobody could hear me. [crying] I told him, "No." 
And I told him, "Stop." And I... [sniffles] I just keep thinking, you know, about... beyond the physical invasion and all the things he did to me, I-I just... I was so powerless. He held me down, and he violated me, and I was paralyzed. I just left my body, and I watched him. I wish I could do that to him. I wish I could rip his world apart the way that he did to mine. I hate walking around campus now. I feel so unsafe. Does that happen to any of you guys? That feeling of helplessness? I wish I could strip away his sense of safety.
