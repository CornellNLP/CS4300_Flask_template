 Training starts tomorrow. 
 Sounds good. 
 We're doing this for different reasons, but people out there need our help. 
 You are attracted to Tyler, right? 
 I killed his brother. It's kind of a deal breaker. 
 What kind of idiot assaults someone while they're driving a Get In? 
 Landon Mays. 
 The son of Albert Mays. President Darlington. 
 So there was two of them? [gasping] Yes, a spicy twist, indeed, but I planted tracking on both of them. What do you know about Will and Tommy? It's a pattern. If you wanna know more about my attack, why don't you just ask the weed dealer? Green hair. She's the one who took the necklace. Where did Jules say she found that necklace? She said Ophelia found it outside of Zeta. That's not what happened. I can barely remember the girl that I was before I got raped. Things have been good ever since we... cheated. I hope that things continue in that direction. Let's do this. If you and your sick sidekick raise your hand against another woman, it'll be a world of trouble. No! [screams] I think you're the one in trouble now. [laughs] Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] Ow. I think you dislocated my boob. [groans] Change. What the heck? Look, I would say it looks a lot worse than it is, but, um, it hurts a lot, and I think I might pass out. You can't possibly not feel the weight of what just happened. Of course I do. I mean, I'm... I'm shaking like a Chihuahua. Look, what do you want me to say? That... that I messed up? 'Cause I did. I messed up big-time, but look, I just saw that dick-face running, and I... Yes, I know. I wanted to go after him, too, okay? But you have to think. I couldn't think. I mean, I just saw red. [siren wailing] Please remain inside and lock all doors! See, this... this could be for anything. Please report it immediately. [alarm blares on phone] _ Campus is on lockdown. Okay, yeah, that's probably for me, but... You girls shouldn't be out here. It's not safe.

Already ringing. [phone vibrating] [phone vibrating] Nope. Ahh! [grunting] [bleep] you, Renee Lasher. If we airplay this to the TV, I bet we can watch it in 3-D. [bell chimes] [grunts] ♪ ♪ That arm is a major problem. Well, you can hardly tell in that video. It's so dark and far away. Oh, and you don't think the police are able to zoom in and get a clearer image? Of course I know that they do. I just didn't think you did. Look, I'm just trying to keep the vibe, you know, calm. There is no calm right now! You have exposed our entire operation. Look, I can keep it covered. I mean, it's sweater weather anyway, so... [winces and grunts] Look, all we need to do is play a part. There's already a lockdown hashtag. You know, we... we post some pictures. We tweet about how scared we are. Just all ups the ante on the illusion that we are two sweet girls who are just as scared of the attacker who's running loose. Wait, girls. The police don't know they're looking for a girl! [grunts] They sure don't. I mean, like, they're probably only checking the dude's 'cause, you know, patriarchy. [knock at door] O, you in there? Hold on one second. O! Yeah, yeah, hold on. Okay. Ah! Ow, ow, ow. Lockdown? I know, right? When did you guys get here? Just a few minutes ago. You know Tyler's downstairs, right? He's here? Yeah, he was picking up some artwork when we got the alerts. He's been trying to get ahold of you. Wow, I should... I should go down there. Um, what's the best way to get to the store? Like, is the alleyway safe? Yeah, yeah, really safe. We'll be right behind you. Okay. O, I need to ask you something. Have you noticed anything strange about Jules? Now that you mention it, she does always sneeze in threes. No. You know how I've been working on the article about the attacks? Yeah, you only mention it every 12 seconds. I know who it is. Wh-who who is? Who this is. Okay, Olivia Benson, who is it? Jules. Hey. I've been calling you. Yeah, I'm sorry. We were just... we were trying to get off the streets fast. But you're okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. [siren wails] Hey, um, if anything happens tonight, like if, um, if something goes wrong, I just... I want you to know that I-I really care about you. Hey, no. We're not talking like that. Nothing is gonna happen to us. Okay. Yeah. I just think I'm being a little neurotic. I just have... I've never been in a situation like this before. Really? This is actually, like, my fifth lockdown. I'm in them all the time. There she is. What? Come on, they got the new Borns LP in the back. Okay. [phone chimes] Hey. _ I'm coming. I still have seven sisters unaccounted for! Come on, ladies, no sister left behind. If you're a little, account for your big. If you are a big, account for your little. Oh, my God. Fro-yo is still delivering. They are so brave. [phone chimes] Oh, finally. Okay, guys, Jules responded. She's okay. You can cross Jules off the list. Jules, Jules, Jules. [phone trilling] Hey. Babe, you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I got the alert when I was headed to the house. Ducked in Darlington Pie. You're on Main? How does it look over there? I saw a couple of police cars race by the house earlier,  but it's been quiet ever since. Yeah, it's nuts here, Ken. Cops are everywhere. Did you see that video? That guy threw a knife. I know. I saw. It's insane. Are you sure you're safe there? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the streets are swarming with cops. Did you lock up the house? Oh, yeah. Mackenzie is on it. Low key, this is the best night of her life. Yeah, I bet. [tires screeching] Hey, I think something's going on outside. I'll... I'll text you in a bit. Stay safe. I love you. Okay, I love you too. You can't just walk away from me. How can you dismiss this so fast? Okay. I know you're saying words, but all I'm hearing is, like, a bunch of crazy. You know, I'd have an easier time believing it was you. First of all, that's a little racist. Second of all, that's impossible. I'm a pacifist. Ophelia, her father was a cop. Fiona says she's been MIA from sorority events all semester long. And the necklace. Oh, my God, are you really gonna put this much stock into a necklace I found on the ground, which, for all we know, could've been there for a week? What's more likely? It was there for a week? Or it fell off during the scuffle moments before you found it? Just think about how many people this guy has taken down. Do you really think that fun-sized, brownie-baking, "Oh, rats," Jules did that? ♪ ♪ Avery is pretty big. Avery? Damon Avery. Barton thinks that maybe that was this guy. Girl. So you're telling me that you think it's possible that Jules took down Damon Avery in a fight? That any girl, for that matter? I mean, he's massive. ♪ ♪ Look, I am the first to admit that Jules is amazing, but she's not a ninja. ♪ There was a thunder inside of my heart ♪ 
♪ There was a wonderful pleasure ♪ 
♪ ♪ We were just looking at this... the records. Oh, yeah, no, I get it. Danger makes me horny too. Hey, actually the, um, the blue and red lights from the cop car are doing great things for your complexions. Just hold on. Let me... [camera clicks] Can you send it to me? I want to 'gram it. Great idea. ♪ ♪ Hey. ♪ ♪ Got all the basics. Bong. Salty snacks. Chocolaty snacks. Gummy snacks. Weed. Rolling papers. Pocket knife. Well, we don't need that pocket knife. We got Jules. She's a little ninja. What? No, no, no. No, he's making a joke because she's so small. It's a hilarious joke. Don't make another one, but it's a great joke. Can you make us a snack? ♪ It was a buried treasure ♪ 
♪ And we got caught in the storm ♪ I'm gonna use the restroom. Thank you so much for letting me know. Yep. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [sirens wailing] Let's go. Who's up? Next. Let me see your left arm. ID, please. I need to see some ID. Put your sleeve up. And where are you coming from? Arms out. You have ID on you? Barton, it's me. Give me a call when you have a chance. I have a theory I want to run by you. It's maybe a little crazy, but maybe it's not. Call me back. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Okay. So Harris definitely thinks you're the vigilante. That's nice. Hey, remember how I said they can enhance that video? The cops are checking everybody's arm. ♪ Paradise ♪ Okay, both sides. We are so screwed. ♪ Green like American money ♪ 
♪ I said hey lifeguard come save my [...] ♪ 
♪  He been breathing heavy ♪ ♪ Thinking about getting nine figures ♪ 
♪  Walking through  your city hall ♪ Okay. Karma is a bitch. Do you think this is because I never go to class? Or is it because I murdered someone? You have to get out of here. No sh1t, Benedict Cumberbatch. What? What has he got to do with this? He is Sherlock. No sh1t, Sherlock. It's a saying. Oh, my God! I do not have time for this. What am I gonna do? Has anyone seen your arm? What are you guys talking about? Nothing. Radical feminism. Great. I made popcorn. You want some? No, we're good. We're gonna go upstairs. Hey. Where you guys going? We're just going upstairs. Her stomach hurts. No it doesn't. It's her. It's her stomach. Well, it's really yours. I mean, it's like Pompeii with your pants. She's joking. Vesuvius is your asshole. That's disgusting. [door closes] [sighs] What can I do for you, Barton? Oh, hi. Hello. Yes, um, I was hoping I could have a minute of your time. Tonight's assault wasn't the first of its kind on this campus. Tommy Cope, Will Powell, both students who were attacked by the same masked assailant. Always brutal attacks, never robberies, and the victims have one thing in common... they're accused rapists. I think we have a vigilante situation on our hands. Barton, that is quite a theory. So these are all of Darlington's, um, sexual assault accusations that have gone uninvestigated. We need to start tracking all the... the rapists across campus so that we can get to the victim of the next vigilante. So this is the only way to get him. This is impressive work, Barton. It's very impressive. I'm going to share this with my superiors. I want to thank you for bringing this to my attention. I mean, should I tell Tyler? 'Cause I don't want him to find out when the police take us away. They wouldn't take you away. They don't know there's two of us. Oh, yeah. Good point. Wait. They don't know there's two of us. Okay, I might have a plan that will keep Harris off your dick and me tied up long enough that the cops won't find me. Right now, Harris has nothing. I mean, he's just guessing. But if he keeps looking, he will eventually figure it out, and if he convinces Barton... Wait, that security guard? Don't you call him Paul Blarton, Mall Cop? Well, yeah. I mean, he's still campus police. You know, he's still a threat. Okay. The plan is simple. One person can't be in two places at once. So if Harris has a run-in with the vigilante while you're there, logic suggests you're not the vigilante. So you're gonna make appearance as a vigilante, like, right now, when we're in a lockdown and the police are looking for you? Will you let me finish the plan? God, sometimes you are so impatient. Look, all I have to do is run through the store as the vigilante, making sure that Harris sees me, while you, Jules, not the vigilante, are also there. I mean, if I keep the activity confined to the store, then I'll be up in my apartment before the cops even know what happened. And then when they respond to the 911 call that you made, I'll just be getting out of my shower. What? Why would you take a shower? This is what I'm gonna need you to do. ♪ Blah blah smoke sip ♪

That's what the attacker would say. Ophelia. Come on. Stop! Hey. Glad to see you're okay. I saw your Instagram, realized I was close. Wanted to come check on you. Jules and I are going upstairs and getting snacks. I thought you were going to shower. Yeah, I changed my mind. We're gonna get some snacks first. [door closes] Girls, right? Totally. I hope they bring us snacks too. Okay, what are we gonna do? I mean, what can we do? We can't just abort the plan because Nate showed up. Hey, are you okay? No! We... sorry. Yes. I just... I can't believe he's ruining a vigilante plan. I know. It's like, let a bitch live, right? Yeah. Yeah, let's just do this 'cause I can't take any more of this uncertainty 'cause I feel like there's a elephant sitting on my chest. You know what? I'll take care of it. And once I handle this, you and Tyler can come up here, and I will get Nate out of the store. Yeah? Yeah, absolutely. You ready to go down there? Yeah. Yeah? Yes! Yeah! Okay. All right. I think it's time for ye old vagilante to make an appearance. Did you just... Yeah. It just kind of rolled off my tongue, and I think it's got real potential.
