 [gasps] Yes! 
 Previously on "Sweet/Vicious"... 
 See you around? 
 Maybe. 
 Best first date ever. 
 Wasn't a date. 
 Huh. 
 I do art installations on campus. 
 The tiny robots? 
 What? No way. 
 My editor only assigns me pieces from the point of view of the black gaze. 
 Like Frank Ocean. 
 Not "gays," "gaze." 
 G-A-Z-E. 
 We're part of the same club. 
 Your dad? 
 Mom. 
 Car accident when I was nine. 
 I have a few questions about your break-in. 
 Whoever sent you, I got the message. 
 If you could just keep what you saw tonight to yourself... 
 All these crimes are connected. 
 If you can back this up, you could have something tremendous on your hands. 
 Big trouble for Carter Fischer. 
 Three girls have now come forward. It's a warrant for your brother's arrest. The girl's lawyered up. We ran a trace on his cell phone. Well, where did his phone ping before he went dark? I know there's something going on with you,  and I don't understand it. And, like, I can barely remember the girl that I was before I got raped. I just know that I miss her. You're right.

I know Rachel. She was my lab partner, Experimental Chem last year. Wait, you took Experimental Chemistry? I was dabbling in some things. Don't worry about it. What kind of idiot assaults someone while they're driving a Get In? The kind of idiot who thinks with the wrong brain. I mean, I get the allure. Drunk girls getting into your car, by themselves, on purpose? Okay, I'm searching Rachel's name to see if there's any complaints filed in her account. And yep, here it is. Last Tuesday. God, this is brutal. "Woke up at home hours after leaving the bar "with ripped underwear "and no recollection of how I got home. I'm worried something happened to me, but I can't remember a thing. I know I got in the car at The Colonel. Please, if there is anything you guys can do to help." And there's no reply, is there? Nope, sure isn't. Look, I'm gonna cross-reference Rachel against the drivers so we have a name for this ass-bag. Driver 4284. Rats, there's no name. But there is a mailing address. I can't help you get Ophelia out of trouble, Harris. I'm busy. What do you know about Will and Tommy? What? No, absolutely not. That's classified. You can't just come in here and ask to see files. That's not how life works. Will assaulted someone named Beth. Now, I've done a good amount of research. I have a lot of pieces, but I'm guessing what I'm missing is in this office. Seems to me we could help each other out. What do you want to know? The way I see it, if there are sexual assault allegations against Tommy Cope, then that means both of them committed acts of sexual violence. I thought I was crazy. Me too! Damon Avery didn't fall. He was attacked. Mm-hmm. And a few weeks ago, a girl reported an assault, but the administration brushed it off. Two is a theory. Three? It's a pattern. Bingo. Let's do this. Harris. Ugh, I was trying to do a dramatic exit with you. Oh, my bad. Let's do it again. No, it's ruined now. We can't do it. Let's just go. What about that one? Oh, that's Orion. It's the hunter. Can you see the bow? Oh, yeah. Why... what... what's he hunting? Well, according to the myth, he was to hunt one of every wild beast that walked the earth. Ambitious. Did he do it? No. He fell in love with a princess and... um, actually, what happened was that he thought that he accidentally killed the princess' sister. I can't even tell you the number of times that's happened to me. I'll meet someone, and chances are, two or three hours later, I'm accidentally killing their sister. That's, uh, a joke. Oh, I know. It's a good one. Well... [chuckles] How do you know all of this? My mom. She was a amateur astronomer. Out where we lived, the sky would just get, like, sick with stars, and every night before we went to bed, we'd climb on the roof and lay there and just stare up at the sky. You can't really do that here 'cause it's too bright. It's definitely what I miss most about home. Hey, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you sad, or... No, it's not you. It's just, um, this week. My mom's... it's 12 years ago this week. Come here. What about you? What's your mom like? Pass. Let's go back to your mom. No. Yeah, I... she doesn't really like that I'm an art major. She wanted me to study something more practical. I don't know. Sometimes I feel like she might have a point. Tyler, you're not thinking about switching your major, are you? Lately it just feels like... where could this possibly go? Tyler, you're so talented. People like your work. Yeah, how would you know? Because it's great. Like, what is the response when you show it? I don't know. I've never had a show before. What? How is that possible? Do you know how much work it is to put on a show? Yeah, but just think how amazing it would be... [gentle music] ♪ ♪ Do you think I'm just gonna drop this because you're a good kisser? I mean, yeah. That was my hope. [both laugh softly] ♪  ♪ Come on. Let's go inside. ♪  ♪ [phone beeps] Oh, hey. Ophelia. Hey. Evan. No, I know. What are you doing here? I'm the RA on this floor. Oh! Fantastic. Do you have a Get In driver living here? Uh, yeah, Landon Mays, 109. He's not here right now, but yeah, that's got to be him. Great. Thank you. That's... Sure, no problem. [smacks lips, chuckles] So, how you been? Good. Yeah, no, I'm really good. I texted you. So are you gonna invite me in? Because I want to make out with your face. Yeah, I was gonna get around to it, I-I swear. Yeah. Your mouth tastes like Gushers. Yeah, I just... I was actually eating some. I have more. [electropop music] ♪ ♪ Yeah. This feels really right. I'm just gonna... Yeah. Hey, Ken, have you ever done a popup event? In my head or in real life? Doesn't matter. Yes to both. I want to surprise Tyler with a popup art show at Vinylton tomorrow. Is it a stupid idea? Do you hate it? Um, I've never loved anything more. Show me his stuff. Damn, he's really good. You know, Nate is actually away this week with the football team. Kennedy, would you like to help me throw a popup art show tomorrow? Oh, my God, I would be honored. [laughter] Hey, look, I-I know how hard this week is for you, so if you need anything, popup or not, I'm here. Thanks. Yeah. [mutters] Uh-uh. Are you sure your controller's connected? 'Cause this... You done? No, not until I cross this finish line right... Rainbow Road, you are my bitch. [chuckles] You know, I am gonna need you to say it. Say what? That I'm the queen of "Mario Kart." I'm pretty sure it's a... it's a representative republic, actually. Okay. Trust. You know, you could just... you could stay over if you want. Uh, yeah. You know, I'm just, like, a really light sleeper. So, you know, the slightest noise, and I'm up all night. Yeah, that sounds like a real thing. Rematch sometime? Maybe. Maybe. [laughs] [door opens, closes] [pop rock music] ♪ ♪ [rock music] ♪ ♪ What the hell is that? I don't know, but I like it. Really? It looks like colors [bleep] other colors. I'm just kidding. I love it. It's beautiful. Okay, next topic. You heard of this kid Landon Mays? Landon Mays? Why does that name sound so familiar? 'Cause he's the son of Albert Mays, president of Darlington. Also known as driver number 4284. ♪ ♪ It looks like... colors [bleep] other colors. That's what I said! Shut up. Hey. Harris, thank you so much for letting us use the store. No, my pleasure. I'm excited. I'm bringing Fiona. Oh, of course. You guys are so cute. And I know she likes you 'cause she stopped going to extra credit. What does that mean? Nothing. Never mind. Don't tell her I said anything about that. Okay. [laughs] I'ma get out of here. You guys have fun. I'll see you later? [hip-hop music] [bell tinkles] Okay, so I did some research on Landon, and I know where he parks his car... no, that sounds like I'm... a metaphor, but it's not. I actually know where he keeps his car. You're leaving now? We're setting up. If we don't get the navigation data, we have no plan. I mean, I'm gonna leave now, and, you know, if I catch a break or two, we could be ready by tonight. No, I'm not... I'm not bailing on Tyler straight after the art show. We can do it tomorrow. [bell tinkles] Hey, babes! Hi. I am here. I have supplies. Let's pop this sh1t up. Yeah, I-I can't do any of this. I'm actually gonna go get some fro-yo. I'll be back. Oh! Oh, would you grab me some? Jules, do you want... Yes, I would... I would love some fro-yo. ♪ ♪ That's great. Super. Great. What flavors do you want? We'll text you our orders. Yeah, that's perfect. Will you? Thanks. All right. Thanks, babe. Mm! My dream is to be a Westport detective. Mmm. Not a big fan of cops. They're not so bad. Oh, maybe to you. Last time I dealt with them, I ended up in cuffs, and they made me drop my peanut butter fro-yo. You can only get peanut butter on Tuesdays. Tell me something I don't know. Tommy Cope? Yeah. My name is Officer Barton. Do you remember me? I know you've said you can't think of anyone who would want to hurt you but what about... could Sasha have had anything to do with this? Sasha, what? I don't... I don't even... first off, that was dismissed, okay? And second of all, it wasn't even like that. We think there might be a connection between the allegation and your attack. If you want to know more about my attack, why don't you just ask that chick? She's the one who took the necklace. [foot thumps door] What chick? The weed dealer. Green hair. What? Did Ophelia say anything to you about a necklace? Of course not. Did she say anything to you? You were the one who questioned her after all of this. Do you think... No. No, no. No way. I'm sure there's an explanation. [dramatic music] ♪ Thinks she can just ask me to get her fro-yo? Who does that? I mean, come on. [beeps] [sighs] "Can you get me fro-yo?"

Girl, tonight is your night. He's gonna be all mushy and grateful. And if he doesn't go down on you for a full hour, he gots to go. Totally. Yeah. I don't know. We're just taking things slow, and I don't want to rush into anything. Okay. Yeah, I can respect that. [bell tinkles] They melted. That was a long fro-yo run. I've got to go. So are you guys okay to finish setting up the bar? Mm-hmm. Wait, just us? Like... just us alone? Yeah. I'm supposed to meet Tyler, and I-I want to change. So I'll see you guys later. Bye, hon. [laughs] You're Tyler Finn, right? Yeah. You look so familiar. How do I know you? I'm Claire Doyle. Your brother assaulted me. Hi. How are you? I-I'm-I'm sorry. I should've... Save it. I just wanted to tell you that what your stepbrother is doing isn't gonna work. He can't just run from this. He's a coward, and my lawyers are gonna put him behind bars. Claire, I'm so, so sorry. If there's anything I can do... Yeah. You can tell your ass of a stepbrother to come home. Face the consequences of what he did. [door opens and closes] Hey. Hi. Who was that? No one.

Why were you talking to Tommy Cope? Okay, I'm not supposed to tell anyone about this, so please don't blow up my spot, but I've been working on a paper about the Darlington vigilante. I think you were right. The attacks are related. W... the what? I know it sounds crazy. Honestly, I'm sure there's no validity to it, but it's been fun to play detective. Wait, did you... do you mean Jules' necklace? Yes. Yes, I... yeah, I found it in the alley. That's actually how we met. Some douchebag stole it out of her locker in the gym.
