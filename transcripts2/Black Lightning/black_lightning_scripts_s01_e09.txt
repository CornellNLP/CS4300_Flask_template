 [Jefferson] Previously, on Black Lightning... 
 [groans] You went too far this time. 
 [Cayman on TV] And our search for Black Lightning has expanded to include another five officers. 
 This act of trying to frame me, I'm guessing it's about Green Light. 
 And we are getting close to shutting it down. 
 [Black Lightning] Yo, Henderson. 
 Hampton Woods, you'll find a shallow grave, and the weapon that actually killed Lady Eve. 
 [Jennifer] Something weird is definitely going on. 
 [gasps] [electricity crackling] 
 I did that. With my hands. 
 When Black Lightning returned, you said you would take care of him. You didn't. 
 I'm bringing ASA operatives to kill him. 
 [Lynn] That sample Anissa brought over from your father's investigation, it's a vaccine. 
 Components of the vaccine are the same active ingredients in Green Light. 
 [Jefferson] Are you saying someone's been working on Green Light for 30 years? 
 You moved here around the time the vaccine came to Freeland. 
 [Gambi] When I realized that the ASA's vaccine was killing children, I leaked the information to your father, and his investigation got him killed. 
 [grunting] 
 [Gambi] All these years, I've kept secrets from you. 
 I leaked the information to your father, and his investigation got him killed. 
 [Jefferson] My father was murdered. 
 [Gambi] Martin Proctor, the head of the ASA for this area, is looking for you. 
 If you use your powers or you go out in the suit, he will find you, and they will kill you. 
 And they will find Anissa, and they will kill her, too. 
 I'm sorry, Jefferson, but you have to stop being Black Lightning. 
 [grunting] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [grunts] 
 ♪♪ Last night I saw a superhero He was black ♪♪ 
 ♪♪ He said This is for the street Black Lightning's back ♪♪ 
 [indistinct chatter] [cell phone vibrating] 
 Yeah? 
 [Jefferson] Man, I thought you and I were supposed to shoot straight with each other. 
 When have I ever shot crooked? 
 Yeah, I gave you a lead that would help find Lady Eve's real killer. 
 And I passed that lead along. 
 Then why did some fool destroy the evidence instead of collecting it? 
 I don't know what you want me to say. 
 Yo... 
 Yo, you strike me as a good man. 
 A good man who knows that a lot of the men he's working with ain't. 
 You know, it's so easy for someone like you. 
 There's no rules. No one to answer to. 
 Yeah, well... It ain't always easy, brother. 
 But neither one of us signed up for easy. 
 Now, this Green Light, it's destroying everything and everyone in its path. 
 I know. 
 So there's a connect between the jokers behind Green Light and somebody who's more dangerous to Freeland than you could possibly imagine. 
 Now, I ain't going to sit around, and watch something worse than crack destroy another generation. 
 Now, I'm going to take out Green Light. 
 And if I have to do it alone... so be it. 
 [inhales sharply] What do you need from me? 
 Well, you know I didn't kill Lady Eve. 
 Yeah. You were set up. 
 Do you know who it was? 
 Yeah, I've got some leads. 
 But you and I both know there are dudes in your department looking the other way. 
 Hmm. 
 I've got some vacation days stored up. 
 I'll use them to do some investigating. 
 [sighs] Just do me one favor. 
 And, what's that? 
 If I end up dead in some alley somewhere, and they say I was dirty, make sure my wife and my family know the truth. 
 [sniffles] 
 I'm not gonna let that happen. 
 [hip-hop music playing] 
 Hey, what's wrong? 
 I don't know. 
 Okay. Well, can I help? 
 Not unless you have some Prozac. 
 Prozac? Stop. Prozac for what? 
 [Jennifer sighs] 
 I don't know, Anissa. I just feel like I'm going crazy. 
 That thing with the phone, it couldn't have been real. 
 But it felt real, so... 
 I think there's something wrong with me. 
 Maybe I'm smoking too much weed. 
 No, it's not. You're not going crazy. 
 Though, you do need to stop that. 
 [scoffs] Okay? 
 [sighs] Look, I knew you weren't going crazy when you first told me about the phone, and... 
 I should've said something, and I didn't, and I'm saying it now. 
 What are you sayin'? 
 The reason I know you're not crazy is because I thought I was going crazy... 
 Well, you are crazy. [scoffs] 
 Stop playing right now. 
 I didn't catch anything on fire, but do you remember the sink? 
 You remember how I broke it? So? 
 I have powers. 
 And it sounds like you probably do, too. 
 "Powers"? Yes. 
 Anissa, what do you mean, "powers"? 
 [sighs] 
 I mean, I have superpowers. 
 Look, I'm Thunder. 
 All right. 
 Okay, look. Jennifer, I know this is a lot for you right now. 
 You're messing with me. I understand. 
 I'm not in the mood. I understand. 
 I'm not screwing with you. You're upsetting my mood so I'm going back to bed. 
 Jennifer! I'm not messing with you! 
 Stop! You stop! 
 Okay, fine. I'll show you I'm Thunder. 
 [inhales deeply] 
 [gasping] Oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God! Put me down! 
 Put me down! Put me down! Put me down! 
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! See, you're not crazy. 
 Listen, we're just like Dad. 
 Dad? Yes. He has powers, too. 
 [gasping] He's Black Lightning. 
 Come here. 
 [Jennifer] Get away from me. Listen to me. 
 [Jennifer] Stay away from me! Would you listen to me? 
 What's going on? Dad! 
 Dad, Anissa said... [gasps] 
 Well, she just lifted up my bed and said you're Black Lightning and she... 
 Well, we have powers! 
 [panting] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. Look, honey, honey, let me explain... 
 "Explain"? How you've been lying to me my whole life? 
 You said I could trust you. [stutters] And you can. 
 Is that supposed to be a joke? Why should I believe anything you say? 
 Jen, come here. 
 Really? 
 What were you thinking? What was I supposed to do? 
 Just let her think she was going crazy? She needed to know. 
 Well, that was not your decision to make. 
 I am the only one in this family who knows exactly what she's going through. 
 No, I think I have a pretty good idea. 
 Oh, really? What major lies did your parents tell you, Dad? 
 Hey. 
 Your father and I never lied to you. 
 We may have withheld certain pieces of information to protect you, but that is what parents do. 
 Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy. 
 Half of being a parent is protecting your kids, so they can stay kids. 
 Well, we're not kids anymore. 
 Listen, even when I am in a nursing home, I will still be your mother, and he will still be your father. 
 What you did, talking to my child... 
 Our child. 
 Our child, about something so serious, without consulting me first, not only was it reckless, Anissa, it was extremely disrespectful. 
 [Anissa] Okay. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know I would never do anything to intentionally disrespect you. 
 Yes, it was wrong, but I felt like I owed it to her. 
 Okay... 
 Well, we're here now, so... 
 We just have to help her get through this the best we can. 
 Mom, she will be all right. Look at me, I survived. 
 Jennifer is not the only one I am worried about, here, Anissa. 
 Have you forgotten your father, Black Lightning, is being framed for a crime he didn't commit? 
 And that there are people out there looking to kill him? 
 And both of you are in danger, and now this? This? 
 Mom, Mom, Mom, I'm sorry. 
 [Jefferson sighs] 
 Hey. 
 I will never let anything happen to those girls. You know that, right? 
 Is that a promise you can really make? 
 You know I will lay down my life for them. For all three of you. 
 You really think the thought of you having to lay your life down makes me feel any better? 
 [Jefferson sighs] 
 Maybe Anissa was right. 
 Maybe we could've done things differently. 
 [chuckling] 
 Yeah. We could've been better. At all of this. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Even with all of our mistakes... 
 at least they'll have a chance... to be a little better at this with our grandkids. 
 I mean, Black Lightning has always been accused of wrongdoing. 
 But, I can't let someone trying to frame me, distract me from my mission. 
 No, that's what they want. They can't have it. 
 No, they can't, so how are we going to stop them? 
 Go after Green Light. 
 Where do we start? 
 Okay, we know there's a connection between Green Light and the vaccine that my father was looking into. 
 Lynn, you proved that. 
 So, if we could just pinpoint who, or what is at the heart of that connection, we can kill two birds with one stone. 
 Take down Green Light and take on who's ever behind this. 
 Okay, so, is Uncle Gambi going to be helping us? Because... 
 No. No. No! 
 What? He can't be trusted with this. 
 Okay, now, my father was clearly getting close to something. 
 [sighs] I mean, that's why he was killed. 
 So we start there. 
 Okay. 
 Besides the powder, what else was in his file? 
 Research... and a reference to a bribery case, and a politician. 
 Tobias Whale? 
 Yes. Good. 
 Okay. 
 Tomorrow, I need to get my hands on those court records. 
 Okay. I'll go with you. 
 Wait, no. Your sister needs you now. Stay here and keep an eye on her. 
 Okay, look... 
 I know the both of you are worried about me, but we have two options. 
 We could pretend that I'm going to lay low and make me sneak behind your backs, or you let me help. 
 [Lynn sighs] 
 Just be safe. 
 Both of you. 
 We will. 
 [hip-hop music playing over speakers] 
 Can I come in? 
 I know exactly what you're going through. 
 [sighs] 
 Well, not unless you came in here to tell me you're Vixen. 
 You didn't, right? 
 Busted. 
 No. I'm kidding. 
 It's not funny. I'm sorry. 
 No, I'm not Vixen. Or Supergirl. 
 Just Mom. 
 [sighs] And you're right. 
 I can't know what you're going through. 
 But I can be here for you, and I am. 
 So when you're ready to talk, you know where to find me, okay? 
 Hey. 
 I love you. 
 What is it? 
 This. 
 BendsCORP. 
 What about them? 
 [sighs] Well, look, they're making monthly payments to Onshore Inc. 
 You see that? Yes. 
 Okay, Dad, there, uh... 
 There was a check from BendsCORP made out to Grandpa in his files. 
 Are you sure? Positive. 
 And I only remember because it wasn't a small amount of money. 
 And the name of the corporation was circled, and GTC was written in big letters on the check. 
 [chuckles] 
 What? [chuckles] 
 Okay, well, instead of saying, uh, "Gotcha," my father would say, "GTC." 
 Now, I don't know. He thought it was funny. 
 Hmm. 
 Okay, so, BendsCORP, whatever it is... Right. 
 ...tried to bribe your grandfather to kill the story about what they were doing to the people of Freeland. 
 But the check was the corroboration he wanted to run his story. 
 All right. So, what now? 
 Well, we need to find out about who was behind incorporating BendsCORP. 
 Those records are public. Should be filed here with the state. 
 All right. I'll be back. 
 We're close. Yup. 
 Close. 
 [injects] Ow! What the hell? 
 I need to know who made a directed-energy weapon that mimics the powers of Black Lightning, and could frame him. 
 Peter, what did you give me? 
 In Africa, they refer to the black mamba venom as the kiss of death. 
 You just got a neck full of it. 
 Now, I happen to have some anti-venom right here. 
 So it seems that I have something you want. 
 You got something I want. 
 [sighs] I have a family. Me, too. 
 [coughing] 
 Hey, it's a fast-acting poison, man. We ain't got all day. 
 I only have a name. 
 Write it down. And how to find him. 
 Follow the instructions, you'll be fine. 
 Give my best to your family. 
 [Anissa] Dad, you're the one who said it wasn't safe to use our superhero look, so I improvised. 
 [Jefferson] Yeah, I just don't know about this. 
 [Anissa] You look great. Relax. 
 [Jefferson] Yo. 
 I got questions that need answers. 
 I'm sorry to hear that, Barack. 
 [Anissa] That's President Obama. 
 It's disrespectful to call him by his first name. 
 The A to Z of BendsCORP. Go. 
 Okay, um, as a law firm of record, any information I have on BendsCORP is privileged and therefore I can't give... 
 [Anissa sighs] - What are you doing? What is she doing? 
 [Anissa] Well, before coming here, I pulled your birthday, your kid's birthday, your wife's birthday, and all of your social security numbers. 
 I even managed to get your family pet's name, your wife's maiden name, so I'm pretty confident that eventually, I can figure out your passwords. 
 And, guess what? I have all night. 
 [Jefferson] But here's the thing... 
 She's patient. 
 I ain't. 
 So while she's typing and hacking... 
 See, I'm trying to decide whether I want to... rare, medium-rare, or well-done. 
 You know what? 
 [electricity crackling] 
 I think I can help you two out. 
 [Anissa] Oh, okay. 
 There you go. [Jefferson] Thought you might. 
 For the record, I voted for you. 
 Both times. 
 [Anissa chuckles] 
 Hey. 
 [both sigh] 
 Look, I know you're upset, but you're lucky. 
 [scoffs] Lucky? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, do you know how I found out the truth about our special family? 
 Girl, Dad and I got into a fight. 
 Or rather, Black Lightning and Thunder got into a fight... 
 Who won? That's not important, okay. 
 Okay, obviously, you didn't. 
 I still don't know how I feel about that name, Thunder. 
 Anissa, do you have a point? 
 Yes, I have a point. 
 Look... 
 I'm not gonna lie. I was freaked out at first, too. 
 And then I thought about all the people I could help. 
 Of course you did, Harriet. But, you know, that's not really my thing. 
 Because the last march I went to, to try and help people, my boyfriend's spine got severed by a bullet. 
 So, I'm good. 
 God, I just want to be normal. 
 Yeah, well, "normal" is overrated. 
 That's something you hear in an after-school special. 
 I'm serious. 
 Anissa, I don't want to be like this. 
 This is who you are, Jennifer. 
 This is who we are. 
 And, listen, you can think of this as a burden, or you can think of it as a gift, a blessing from God. 
 Choice is yours. We are who we are. 
 But that's the point. The choice is not ours. 
 We don't have a choice. 
 Doesn't that piss you off just a little bit? 
 Not as much as the thought of a woman getting raped or beaten down because Thunder wasn't there to protect her. 
 What's that? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 What do you mean, it's nothing? You're watching something. 
 Well, that Thunder... She is fine! 
 Look, she can save me any day of the week, all right? 
 I mean... 
 That ass, though! Right? 
 Boys, look. You know what, though? 
 ♪♪ That, that ass Though, though, Right, right, right? ♪♪ 
 ♪♪ That, that ass, Though, though, Right, right, right? ♪♪ No, it's not funny. Even still, saving all these lives, all guys want to do is talk about my ass. Like, really? 
 Well, I just searched "Black Lightning and Thunder" to see what came up, but... 
 By the way, you know you have more fans online than Dad does? 
 What? I do? 
 Someone actually just started a new fan page about you, and it doesn't mention your ass. 
 It talks about how you're challenging the patriarchy's narrative of female heroes. 
 [inhales] Really? 
 You want me to show you? 
 Yeah, I kind of do. Let me see. [both chuckling] 
 [Jennifer] Yeah, I know you wanna see. 
 [Anissa] Let's see what you've been watching. 
 [computer processing] 
 [distorted voice] Who referred you? 
 Thomas Hidalgo. 
 It's in regards to special weapons that are meant to kill Black Lightning. 
 He's not permitted to refer anyone. 
 I think you're going to want to make an exception for me. 
 You're going to hurt yourself, old man. 
 I think you should take up another hobby. Like golf. 
 I always hated golf, Caleb. 
 You're thinking of hanging up on me, but that wouldn't be smart since I know your full name, Caleb Scott, also your current address, 1245 Goff Avenue. 
 I also happen to know that there's a patrol car about a block away from you, and that you have a stash of unregistered assault weapons that you're selling on the dark web. 
 - So... [in normal voice] What do you want? 
 I just need to know where someone got a particular weapon. 
 You give me that name and address, I lose your name and address. 
 [Caleb sighs] 
 [man 1] Detective Cayman. 
 [man 2] Let's see what you got for us. 
 [Cayman] These are the guns that Carter wanted. The ones to kill Black Lightning. 
 [camera shutter clicking] 
 [Inspector Henderson] Yeah, Cayman. I always knew you were dirty. 
 [man 1] This is good. 
 [beeping] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 [grunts] 
 [all whooping] 
 Let's go! Let's go! 
 Let's go! 
 Martin. I've found another one. 
 Give me some time. I'll find out where he lives. 
 Thanks for coming. You said it was an emergency. 
 It is. 
 Your father know you're here? No. He said we can't trust you. 
 That's fair. 
 So, why'd you come? 
 Because I wanted to determine that for myself. 
 What happened between you two? 
 I did something very bad a long time ago. 
 And there was stuff I should've told your father before now. 
 He doesn't trust me because I held out on him for so long. 
 [sighs] I can't blame him. 
 
 
 
 But I just want to make things right, not just with him, but... 
 With your conscience? 
 But also, because people are in danger. 
 I used to work as a sort of a scout. 
 A scout? A scout for who? 
 For some people I now know are very bad. 
 I helped them find young people with abilities. 
 You mean, young people like me with powers? 
 Yes. 
 And I just saw the body of one of the boys that I helped find 30 years ago. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Along with several others. 
 Please. Don't tell your father just yet. 
 Listen... Anissa. [sighs] 
 I told your father that the people I used to work for are hunting Black Lightning. 
 I don't think it's safe for either of you to be out. 
 I have seen and done some terrible things in my life, but I can't get out of my head what I saw at that lab. 
 Black Lightning's the only one who can expose what's been done and bring these people to justice. 
 Will you please tell him? 
 [Anissa sighs] 
 Yes. 
 Anissa... 
 Regardless of what you all may think of me, I will always care about you, and your family. 
 And I would do anything to protect you. 
 This is for you. 
 Be safe.

 Uncle Gambi gave it to me. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Dad, look, I know you said we can't trust him, but he gave me this because he wants me to be safe. 
 He cares. About all of us. 
 Anissa, this is between him and me. 
 Now if you knew the whole story... 
 Look, I know enough. 
 He didn't tell you something he should have, and that... It was wrong. 
 But Jennifer feels like you did the same thing. 
 No. It's completely different. 
 Is it? 
 It's not important. 
 Now, Anissa, you need to know... the guys we're going after are not just gangbangers or dealers breaking the law, they are beyond the law. 
 So, if we take down their lab... 
 You mean, when we take down their lab. 
 When we take down their lab, it's like declaring war. 
 Things could go south. Big time. 
 If they do, don't worry about me. I want you to save yourself. 
 Run. Live for another day. Do you understand? 
 Yes. I understand how serious this moment is. 
 Let's take your new outfit out for a test drive. 
 Hey. 
 Stop right there. 
 You said when I was ready to talk, I could. 
 Hey. I don't know what goes on in your friends' families, but in this family, young ladies who roll their eyes or give their parents the silent treatment are young ladies who can start paying their own phone bills. 
 Sit down. 
 Look, there was no right time to tell you. 
 And I am sorry that we hurt you. 
 But you need to know, that being a parent, sometimes, we have to make decisions without consulting you, and hope and pray that they're the right ones. 
 You didn't this time. 
 You and Dad always tell me that you trust me. 
 I know where this is going. Look, honey... 
 We couldn't have you blurt out the wrong thing when you were little. 
 Later, it wasn't worth you knowing because your father had stopped being Black Lightning. 
 The only reason he came back was to get you and your sister out of that motel. 
 Why didn't you tell me that I was going to get powers, too? 
 We didn't know, baby. 
 We didn't know how Jeff got his powers, but we did know he didn't inherit them. So why would you? 
 [sobs] I feel like a freak. 
 No. No. No, you're not. 
 Who's going to want to be with me? 
 Hey. 
 I fell in love with your father. 
 That's why you broke up, isn't it? 
 [sighs] Mom, tell me the truth. 
 Is that why you and Dad got divorced? 
 Yes. 
 But your father has always been there for us. 
 If he didn't have powers, you two would still be together. 
 So would Anissa and Chenoa. 
 Mom, I'm not Anissa. 
 I don't want to save the world. 
 I want to go to prom, and college, and get married, and have babies. 
 Can I even have kids? 
 [sighs] 
 I don't... 
 You don't know. 
 [sobbing] 
 Do you? 
 Oh, baby, no. I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 [train whistle blowing] 
 All right, so what if he doesn't show up? 
 No, we scared the hell out of that crooked lawyer. 
 We did. 
 Yeah, he knows that we'll pay him another visit if he lied. 
 So if he said Martin Proctor will be here tonight, he'll be here. 
 All right. 
 There he is. 
 [Thunder] Okay. 
 [train horn blowing] 
 [Cayman] Hello. Yeah. [indistinct chatter] 
 [camera clicking] 
 [devices activating] 
 [indistinct talking] 
 [Black Lightning sighs] 
 I wish we knew what he was saying. 
 [Thunder] No, no, no, I got it. He said, "Something's wrong. I can't reach Teddy. 
 We need to move the lab tonight. Get the last batch out." 
 Come on. We got to go. Let's go follow him. 
 How did you hear that? 
 [chuckles] 
 I didn't. 
 So a bunch of us, we took a lip-reading class, so we could know what the police were saying about us while we were protesting. 
 Hmm. [chuckles] 
 You know, you're not bad at this. 
 Really? 
 Don't get a big head. I said "not bad," not "good." 
 Dad, okay. All right. Not bad. Let's go. 
 [Inspector Henderson] Yeah, got you now. 
 [cell phone buzzing] 
 Yo, I was just about to... 
 [Inspector Henderson] Yeah, I'm on Cayman. 
 He's got his bent boys with him, and they're with a bunch of guys. 
 Men in Black type. 
 [vehicle approaching] [panting] 
 My gut tells me they're up to something. 
 'Cause they got enough firepower to start a war. 
 So stop following them. I'm all caught up. I can't back you up. 
 No, I got to. This is bad. I can feel it. 
 Henderson. Henderson! 
 [upbeat music playing] 
 [man 1] Hurry up! 
 [man 2] Come on, come on! 
 [man] Black Lightning's here! 
 Get out of here! [Black Lightning] Leave now! 
 [man 2] It's Black Lightning! Let's get out of here! 
 [man 3] Get out of here! 
 [rumbling] 
 What was that? 
 How the hell should I know? 
 Because I pay you to know. Go see what it is. 
 [alarm blaring] 
 [Thunder inhales deeply] 
 [grunting] 
 [Thunder inhales deeply] 
 [man screaming] 
 [groans] 
 [man] Hey! 
 Where are you guys? 
 [man] We're close. Moving in now. 
 Our friend's about to make an appearance. 
 And also, prepare for evac. 
 What are you doing? 
 Move and I'll kill the doc. 
 [laughs] 
 You'd be doing us a favor. 
 I'm not a bad guy! I'm a doctor. I just... 
 Kill thousands of people every day with this poison you're making? 
 [gunshot] 
 [electricity crackling] 
 [Inspector Henderson] You're welcome. 
 [handcuffs clicking] 
 Thank you. Now get him out of here. 
 Things are about to get a little messy. 
 [workers whimpering] 
 [electricity crackling] 
 [man] Remember, orders are to take the target alive. 
 [grunts] 
 [beeping] 
 [groaning] 
 [man] And it works. Switch to standard ammo. 
 We got body armor, so headshots to finish. 
 [electricity crackling] 
 [sighs] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Where's your mom? 
 Uh, she's upstairs. On the phone. 
 Listen... 
 I understand why you've been upset with me, but I just want to say, all these years, I've kept these secrets to protect you. 
 And you're right. 
 Powers aren't always a blessing, they can be a burden. 
 I don't want that for you. 
 But I understand you're not a little girl anymore, 
 and I can't treat you like one. 
 And that means bein' honest with you. 
 And I will. 
 Okay? 
 From here on out. 
 I know.
