 [Jefferson] Previously on Black Lightning... 
 [beeping] [grunts softly] 
 You're looking at the king of Freeland. 
 Good day, Mr. Green. 
 The panel's decision has been made, and that decision is final. 
 Some straight bull! Security! 
 [Todd] You can take that grant to hell. 
 [Tobias] I've been monitoring you for a while now. 
 When I heard you weren't gonna get that grant, I figured it was a good time to reach out. 
 Did you really just deposit 100 grand into my account? 
 I wanted you to know I put a value on your time. 
 Whatever it is, I'm in. 
 I better get my money's worth. 
 Just tell me who this person is you want found. 
 [Tobias] Him. 
 Giselle Cutter. Assassin, tracker, world-class martial artist, mercenary for hire. 
 There is a killer on my daughter's tail, hired by Tobias, which means that she's... 
 [Gambi] She's after Khalil. 
 Are you good to go? 
 Yeah. 
 This is like finding a needle in a haystack. 
 [Black Lightning] What about this last one? 
 That's gotta be her. Let's go. 
 [buzzing] 
 They were definitely here. 
 Just tell me the truth. 
 Is Jennifer dead? 
 I don't know. 
 [sobs] 
 [Thunder] Anything? [Gambi over comms] Not yet. 
 [Black Lightning] We were close behind them. 
 How could they just disappear? 
 [Gambi] They didn't disappear. 
 They're out there and we're gonna find them. 
 [Thunder] Look, I hate to be Captain Obvious, but if they're still out there, we need to find them before Cutter and Tobias do. 
 [Gambi] Just concentrate on your riding. You're new to that bike. 
 Okay. 
 Let me know when you find something. 
 [engine revving] 
 [grunts] 
 [wincing] 
 ♪♪ Last night I saw a superhero He was black ♪♪ 
 ♪♪ He said "This is for the street Black Lightning's back" ♪♪ 
 [siren wailing in distance] 
 J, come on. 
 Mmm-mmm, Khalil, do not do that. 
 I just walked hella miles on foot with you. 
 Don't piss me off, I'm coming. 
 [Jennifer exhales] 
 Khalil, where the hell are we? 
 [Khalil] Uh... 
 [sighs] 
 My apartment. 
 [grunts] 
 Did you draw all of these? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Modern day Basquiat. 
 This is kinda fly. 
 [chuckles] Yeah, thanks. 
 Yeah, you know, I needed someplace where no one could find me, a place away from Tobias. 
 Besides, I've always liked trains. 
 Yeah, ever since I was a kid, I would watch Thomas the Tank Engine. 
 Well, you probably should've asked for some help, because interior design is not your area. 
 [both laughing] 
 Okay, so you got jokes. 
 [exhales deeply] 
 Jen, where are you? 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Yeah? 
 You sound tired. Maybe you should get some rest. 
 I'm not resting until our baby is home. 
 Yeah, we're on it, but they ditched the car and there's no bus stops nearby or reports of other cars stolen. 
 So what do we do? 
 Well, Gambi thinks they're hiding, waiting for us to exhaust our search. 
 But where that is exactly, we don't know. 
 Khalil's. 
 What do you mean, "Khalil's"? 
 I was hoping to find someone Khalil might contact who would convince him to bring Jen back, so I went to see his dad. 
 Wait, the felon? 
 I went to see his dad, and he said Khalil has his own place somewhere Tobias can't find him. 
 We know Jennifer and Khalil were texting before they dumped their cell phones. 
 I'll get Khalil's number and track the ping records. 
 Eliminating Tobias-related locations might help us find that hideaway. 
 Good. 
 Lynn, no more moves without backup, please. 
 I hear you. 
 So, uh, noodles in a cup or ramen? 
 Oh, I'm a ramen girl. 
 Cool. 
 Hey, you remember that time I asked you to be my girl? 
 Yeah, how could I forget? [chuckles] 
 You said that if anything had happened to me, the thought of not being able to ask me out really messed with you. 
 Yeah, I remember. 
 You was all shy and cute. 
 Wait. 
 "Was"? Don't worry. 
 You're still cute now that we cut off those promoter dreads. 
 Well, uh... 
 you remember this? 
 You know, I was thinking that... 
 I'd like to give it back to you. 
 Hey, look, um... 
 Look, even if you say yes, it doesn't mean you have to take me back, or we even have to be boyfriend and girlfriend. 
 It's just that, because you're here right now, I thought... 
 it belongs with you. 
 [chuckles] You know what? Sorry. Yeah, it's... 
 I'd love to have it back. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 See? 
 No glow. 
 Just beautiful you. 
 Khalil... 
 [sighs] 
 I can't. 
 I can't do this. 
 I'm sorry, but I'm not ready. 
 I didn't leave home to lose my virginity in a train car like this. 
 Yeah. I left home to keep you safe. 
 To keep you alive. 
 And I don't regret that because you are alive. 
 [crying] 
 But I don't... I don't want it to be like this. 
 "We were on the run in a train car." 
 You know? 
 I'm worried. 
 I'm worried about what's gonna happen to you, worried about what's gonna happen to me. 
 I'm worried about what my family's thinking about me. 
 Hey... it's okay. 
 I will wait. 
 Come on. 
 What are you thinking about? 
 I'm wishing this was all a dream. 
 Yeah, well, it ain't. 
 Where are we going after we finally get the heck up out of Freeland? 
 California? 
 Uh-uh, I'm not leaving Freeland just to stay in the States. 
 I want to go to Bahia. 
 Oh, yeah, definitely Bahia. 
 Yeah? [chuckles] Yeah. 
 We also need to learn some languages. 
 I was thinking Portuguese. What you think? 
 Ooh, French. 
 Yeah, okay. I'm not bad at French. 
 [chuckles] 
 Teach your little friend, too. 
 [laughs] 
 [Black Lightning] All right, here she is. 
 [Thunder] She's gonna want answers. 
 Did you guys manage to come up with anything? 
 [Gambi] Analyzing the cell towers Khalil's been using, I've managed to eliminate the most frequently visited places that he wouldn't go now, like Club 100, his mother's apartment. 
 That leaves us with a two-mile area of mostly abandoned factories. 
 That's a lot to search, Uncle Gambi. 
 Any way we can narrow it down any further? 
 Not without a live signal from Khalil's cell phone. 
 Okay. Okay, fine. 
 So, Gambi and I will take these. 
 You and Anissa take... 
 No! Jeff, It'll be way more efficient if we search individually. 
 Absolutely not. It's too dangerous. 
 I'll be fine. Give me an area. 
 We don't have time to chitchat. 
 [gun cocks] 
 Fine. We search individually. 
 I'll divide the map into four parts. 
 It's on your phone. 
 [motorcycle engine starts] 
 Watch her. 
 ["The Pan Piper" playing] 
 Hmm, spectacular, isn't it? 
 It's not bad. 
 "Not bad"? 
 This man changed the landscape of music at least three times. 
 Americans, and most Negroes, don't respect the impact jazz had on the culture. 
 The Birth of Cool, Miles, Mingus, Art Blakey, Duke Ellington... I could go on and on. 
 That's black excellence. 
 A man like yourself should be able to relate. 
 And why is that? 
 Because jazz is underappreciated, Todd, just like you. 
 Why do you keep saying that? Is it not true? 
 Anything else, Mr. Whale? 
 No. You can excuse yourself. 
 How is it? 
 It's toficken. 
 I know you're one of them transformed Negro vegans. 
 [laughing] 
 I made it my business to know everything about you, like how you're an encryption specialist who can understand the internal workings of algorithms, that you can read them well enough to have access to whatever you want. 
 So that's why I'm here? Of course. 
 I have a problem that requires an intellectual musician. 
 I have an instrument that needs mastering. 
 And based on what I've read about you, I assume that we're working outside of the boundaries of all conventional and legal activities. 
 Hmm. [cell phone vibrating] 
 Answer it. 
 Open them thick lips and use your white voice. 
 Hello, you've reached the office of Tobias Whale. 
 This is Todd speaking. 
 Someone named Cutter? 
 Yes, what can I help you with? 
 [in normal voice] Are you sure you want me to tell him that? 
 Cutter no longer has eyes on Khalil. 
 Damn it! 
 He's not happy. 
 She wants to know the three most visited locations of Khalil's implant? 
 Can I ask why? 
 Wait, what the hell does 
 "walking backwards in your own footsteps" even mean? 
 Hello? Hello? 
 Just how long has Cutter been looking for this Khalil? 
 Too damn long. 
 Jen! 
 Jen, it's Uncle Gambi! 
 Are you in here? 
 Jen! 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Jen! 
 Jennifer? 
 [blows landing] [man grunting] 
 [men laughing] 
 [grunts] 
 [men groaning] 
 [chimes] [gasps softly] 
 Have you seen these two? 
 [speaking Spanish] 
 [in English] Thank you. 
 Jennifer! 
 Jennifer? 
 [Khalil shushing] 
 Jennifer, are you here? 
 Please come home, baby. 
 I know it may seem like running is the right idea, but it isn't. 
 There's no finish line for you or Khalil if you just keep moving. 
 You'll get hurt... 
 or worse. 
 Let us help you. 
 Please come back. We'll help you. I promise. 
 We're not a family without you, Jen. 
 Home is not home. 
 We just need you to come back. No one's mad at you. 
 We just want you home and safe. 
 I love you, Jennifer. 
 I love you. 
 [Khalil] Whoa, whoa, whoa, J... 
 J, listen to me, we cannot go back. 
 Do you think I wanna go back to that Rikers Island of a home? 
 I don't, but she's right. 
 She's right. 
 We're not fooling anybody but ourselves. But we aren't fools. 
 I mean, look how long we've survived on our own. 
 J, does that not count for anything? 
 Yes, it does, but I don't want to survive. I want to live. 
 I want to live a good life, with you, but running is not gonna help anything. 
 Running is not gonna help us solve any of our problems. 
 J, you don't understand. 
 If we go back, Tobias will find us. 
 He'll find me. 
 [sighs] 
 But he's not looking for you. 
 [scoffs] 
 I'm sorry, I... 
 J, I put you in this... No, don't start, Khalil. Don't start. 
 I put you in this crazy situation. 
 It's time for you to go home. 
 [Jennifer] Hi. 
 Jen? [Jefferson] Jen! 
 [laughter] [Jefferson] Oh! 
 Hey, Mr. P. 
 Dad! Dad! Dad! 
 No. Dad, stop. 
 You're lucky my family's here... 
 'cause I would whoop your ass. 
 [beeping] 
 [Todd] Damn. 
 Exactly. 
 I've been able to access some information, mainly about crooked politicians, corrupt agencies of law enforcement, judges, and some very interesting real estate purchases made 30 years ago under an alias that doesn't exist. 
 I managed to secure the property except for one building, a clinic owned by a pimpy-ass preacher. [scoffs] 
 That's as far as I've been able to get with it, but I know it's bigger, I know there's more. 
 Uh, what would the ASA want with property in the heart of the ghetto? 
 That's what I need you to find out. 
 And most importantly, what does all this have to do with metas? 
 Well, well, well, look what didn't drag Khalil in. 
 I am not in the mood for your jokes, little boy. 
 [Tobias] Give her what she needs. 
 Whoa, whoa, okay. I don't think that that's a good idea. 
 When I looked up Khalil's three most-visited locations, I did a little bit of extra research, and Cutter has some, uh, holes in her resume. 
 I'll slit your throat, you little bitch! 
 Give her the list. 
 Okay. Just... trying to look out for you. 
 I know, and I do greatly appreciate the initiative, Todd, but you might want to tread lightly around natural born killers. 
 Cutter. 
 Do the job and do it fast. Yeah. 
 Khalil being free means his weak ass can snitch on me. 
 And he's slowed me down enough already. 
 I got it. 
 I need to get past this firewall. 
 I want all information before I move the way that I need to. 
 [exhales] 
 Little bitch. 
 [Jefferson sighs] 
 [Khalil sighs] 
 Okay, look, Mr. and Mrs. Pierce, I know I can't take back any of the hurt that I've caused, but I am sorry, mostly for getting Jennifer involved in all of this. 
 And it's not even her fault. 
 She was just trying to help me out. 
 That's not completely true. I... 
 I made a choice to run with him. 
 We accept your apology, Khalil. 
 And it's very admirable that you would defend each other, but it doesn't change the fact that Khalil is a danger to you when he's with you. 
 Because of Tobias? 
 Yes, because of Tobias. 
 He wants Khalil dead, period. 
 And if that means he has to kill you to make that happen, he will, period. 
 Plus, Khalil knows too much to risk Tobias getting his hands on him. 
 Yeah. 
 You mean about Jen having powers or you being Black Lightning? 
 [Jennifer] I... She didn't tell me. 
 I'm not stupid. 
 I mean, she's electric, and you and Thunder came after us. 
 I would never do anything to hurt any of you. 
 [Jefferson chuckles sarcastically] 
 Yeah, that may be true... now. 
 But what I meant is that Tobias knows you can help put him behind bars. 
 [sighs] 
 Look, as far as I can see, there's only one option. 
 What? 
 He has to turn himself in to the authorities. 
 Dad... No, please. 
 Please. You care more about getting Tobias than what happens to him? 
 [Lynn] Jennifer... Mom, it's the truth. 
 J, stop. What... 
 Tobias is crazy, and I do know too much about him. 
 And he'll never stop coming after me. 
 And if he catches me, hey, I'm a danger to you... 
 To your family. 
 Your father's right. 
 I have to turn myself in. 
 [Inspector Henderson] He's a wanted murderer, Jeff. I know. 
 And he tried to kill you. He did kill you, technically. 
 Yeah, I know that, too. 
 And, Jeff, don't get me wrong, I'm glad Jen is home, but I don't know why you want me to help this kid. 
 Okay, look, look. He made a lot of bad choices, I know that. 
 He knows it, too. 
 But roll of the dice. 
 If he doesn't get shot, all of this turns out differently. 
 A lot of people have bad things happen to them, and they don't go to work for a psychopath and run around shooting people in the ass with poison darts. 
 If we don't help, Tobias will kill him. 
 [sighs] 
 Look, man... this is not easy for me, but he brought Jennifer home safely. 
 I may not owe it to him, but... 
 I, at least, owe it to my daughter to care about what happens to him. 
 Well, no agency is gonna protect him unless he testifies. 
 Yeah, Khalil understands that. 
 I can't believe you're trying to save this kid's life after all he put you through. 
 Yeah, I know man. I know. 
 But... 
 I guess I'm just glad that he's... 
 He's the person that I thought he was. 
 Sure you are. 
 Always want to help people. 
 Henderson? 
 What? 
 He wants to see his mother first. 
 [chuckles] The feds won't make any stops, Jeff. 
 This is gonna be hard enough to pull off without a tour of Freeland in the middle of it. 
 Okay, then Black Lightning and Thunder will arrange a meeting, and then we'll take care of the hand off. 
 You are still a vigilante in the eyes of the law. 
 [Jefferson exhales] 
 All right, I'll make sure the boy sees his momma. Damn. 
 All right. Docks, tonight? Yes. 
 [scoffs] 
 [exhaling] 
 It looked like a tornado went through here. 
 There were a lot of big feelings after you ran off. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 It wasn't your most mature move. 
 Anissa, we didn't have a choice. 
 You always have a choice. 
 Tobias wanted to kill him. 
 You should've told me, Jen. I would've helped him. 
 Really? You weren't saying that when Mom and Dad had me on that tight leash. 
 That's because they didn't want anything bad to happen to you. 
 And they were right. 
 Your ass ended up being chased by hired killers. 
 Yeah, and I still had more fun than I've been having at home. 
 Come here. 
 [sighs in relief] 
 Did you have s*x with him? 
 How did you know that was a conversation? 
 Girl, two good-looking teenagers on the run, in danger. 
 I ain't gotta be Miss Cleo to figure that out. 
 [both laughing] 
 
 
 
 So, did you? 
 Part of me wanted to, but no. 
 Hmm. 
 At this point, it seems like it'll never happen. 
 Look, you did what was right for you in the moment. 
 And there ain't nothing wrong with some self-love. 
 [chuckles] Okay? 
 Yeah. All right. 
 Come here. 
 [giggling] 
 Yeah. 
 [Tobias] Really? Hmm, thank you for the heads-up. 
 Before I let you go, what's your favorite color? 
 Blue? 
 [laughs] 
 Mine's, too. Okay. 
 "Blue." 
 There's no imagination in that. It's like saying you like ice cream. 
 I like ice cream. 
 Of course you do. 
 Have a blue 450 delivered to my old friend ADA Montez. 
 Make sure it can't get traced back to me. 
 Also, give this info to Cutter. 
 Khalil is trying to save his black ass by snitching on me and going into witness protection. 
 Well, do you know when and where the feds are taking custody? 
 It's on that paper. 
 Hey. 
 Yo, you should not be out here. 
 Go. 
 Okay. Why? 
 Is Tobias Whale in your backyard? 
 That's not funny. 
 [sighs] Okay, you paranoid much? 
 Look, after everything we've been through, I don't want anything to happen to you. 
 Hey, come here. 
 [Khalil chuckles] 
 Khalil, I'm so sorry. 
 For what? 
 For everything. 
 If you hadn't gotten shot at the march, then... 
 Tobias wouldn't be chasing you... Stop. 
 [exhales deeply] 
 Look... 
 Look, I know I said that I wouldn't have gone that night without you, [sighs] but I was just trying to get the pain out of me and on to someone else. 
 I was going to the march. 
 Being with you was just a bonus. 
 None of this, none of it is your fault. 
 I really don't want you to go. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Yo... this isn't the end. 
 Look, I do the right thing, and Tobias, he goes to jail forever. 
 I get to come back, and who knows, we can finish what we started, okay? 
 I love you. 
 And you're the best thing that has ever happened to me. 
 [sighs] 
 [indistinct chatter on police radio] 
 Hey! Hey, stop! It's all right. Let her go. Let her go. 
 [crying] Hi, Momma. 
 [Inspector Henderson] We've only got a couple of minutes. 
 All this for my baby. 
 Really? Really? Hey. Hey, stop. 
 Mom, it's okay. 
 Hey, it's okay. 
 I'm so sorry for everything. 
 I didn't mean to put you through this. 
 All right. We gotta go. Come on. 
 [Khalil] It's going to be okay. 
 I'm gonna be back, Momma. 
 Momma, you gotta... Let's go. 
 Let's go. [sobbing] No. No. 
 What, you've got to sign for him like he's a package? 
 Law enforcement love their paper trail. 
 [indistinct chatter on police radio] 
 Is he gonna be okay? 
 Well, he's better with them than with Tobias. 
 Why are you stopping? Run her over or go around. 
 Really? 
 Alert everyone. I'm gonna check it out. 
 Situation, 41. Checking it out. 
 Ma'am, are you okay? 
 [agent grunts] 
 Damn! Agent down! Agent down! 
 [agent] Put your hands up! 
 Get on the ground! Hands! Let me see 'em! 
 [indistinct shouting] [guns cocking] 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Hey, thanks for setting this whole thing up... 
 Something went wrong with Khalil's transport. 
 I'm about two minutes from the caravan route. 
 [sighs] I'm on my way. 
 Tell Anissa to reroute. 
 Henderson says something's gone wrong with the transport. 
 You got it. 
 [beeping] 
 [man on radio] Convoy, this is dispatch. 
 Please check in. What's going on? 
 Central Command asking for immediate sitrep. 
 Please give your location... 
 [chatter continues indistinctly] 
 Police code 2. 
 We are asking for any available units to come in. 
 Dispatch to all available units, please track down team, Protection team has gone quiet. 
 Officers AWOL. No response. 
 Bring in all available units. 
 [line ringing] 
 Hey. [Black Lightning] I'm almost there. 
 No need. Everybody's dead. 
 Khalil? 
 There's no sign of him. 
 [sirens wailing] 
 [helicopter blades whirring] 
 Okay. 
 [TV playing indistinctly] 
 Yeah, okay. 
 [TV turns off] What? 
 It's Khalil. 
 Khalil what? 
 He's been kidnapped. 
 I'm sorry. No. 
 Ugh. No. 
 No, no, no! 
 No, I told you! I told you! 
 [sobbing] No! No! 
 [jazz music playing] 
 [Tobias laughing] 
 Well, well, well. 
 Leaving was all on me. 
 My idea. My plan. 
 You trying to get me to go soft on the Pierce girl? 
 I made her go. 
 Hmm. She had no idea what... 
 She had plenty of chances to get away, but she didn't. 
 But once she left, she couldn't go back. 
 Her father's a hardass. 
 It's practically a Romeo and Juliet story, isn't it? 
 Two young lovers, desperate to be together. 
 Nah, that's not it. 
 I just wanted to get away from your crazy ass. 
 [chuckles] 
 I got no beef with the Pierce girl. 
 She didn't get Syonide killed or do a half-assed job and then run away without facing the consequences. No. 
 That was you. 
 I wanted you to be great like Alexander, but you've got the heart of a stooped sharecropper, happy to spend the days tending to master's land. 
 We've got no time for small dreams here, Khalil. 
 So if you can't walk with the giants, then you shall crawl with the snakes! 
 [grunts] [Khalil groans] 
 [screaming] 
 [Tobias laughing] 
 Not so fast now, are you? 
 [jazz music continues playing] 
 [Tobias laughing] 
 I told you I'd always have your back. 
 [exhales] 
 Why don't you two take out the trash? 
 [laughing] 
 [tires screech] 
 [groaning] 
 [woman] Oh, my God! [man] Somebody call an ambulance! 
 [Khalil] Somebody, help, please. 
 Please. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 It's gonna be all right, son. 
 Remember, the Lord is your shepherd... 
 [Khalil crying] You understand? 
 No harm or evil can betake you. 
 We ask you to come by here right now, Lord, and put your arms around him. 
 He's gonna keep you. 
 Just hang on, son. 
 He's gonna keep you. 
 [beeping] 
 [automated voice] Access to Project MOD granted. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, yes! Oh! 
 Tobias! 
 Hey, Tobias! 
 Hey! 
 What the hell is the problem? 
 Keep making all that damn noise, I'mma throw your smart black ass out the window. 
 Ah... I'm... I'm sorry. 
 Uh, I did it! Did what? 
 I broke the code! 
 I got past the briefcase's firewall. Look. 
 All right, now, look. 
 So these are the pod kids. 
 Wow. 
 "The first shall be last and the last shall be first." 
 This is good. 
 Yeah, but it only gets better. 
 "Better"? Yeah. 
 See, remember we were wondering why this clinic? 
 Why the ASA was so interested in it 30 years ago? 
 Hmm. It's where they were giving the original vaccinations to the kids of Freeland. 
 It's the first piece of property the ASA bought. 
 Rev. Holt took over it after they stopped the first experiments. 
 Your thick lips ain't making sense, Todd. 
 [Todd sighs] 
 [Tobias] Okay, what the hell is "MOD"? 
 [Todd] Masters of Disaster. Super metas. 
 There are four metas here, all right? 
 These are old ASA experiment pods. 
 [Tobias] Hmm. 
 [Todd] These are their vitals. 
 Now, the clinic, of course, has been remodeled since then, so I can't pinpoint exactly where they are, but they're here. 
 So, what now? 
 Now it all begins. 
 [closing theme music playing]
