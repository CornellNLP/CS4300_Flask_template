 [Jefferson] Previously on Black Lightning... 
 [Rose] A week ago, three suspects invaded the school. 
 You were not on campus. 
 The school will remain closed. 
 I'll step down as principal. 
 [Reverend Holt] The killing of Issa Williams is proof that this drug, Green Light, has left our community in grave danger. 
 There are people infected with this drug who're running around 
 - with dormant powers. Issa? 
 So now they jumping out of body bags and coming back from the dead? 
 J, what's up? [panting] 
 The purpose of Black Lightning was to kill Tobias, who killed my father. [groaning] 
 [Gambi] Thirty years ago, they were conducting an experiment in Freeland. 
 Their vaccine inadvertently created metahumans. 
 I went to Gambi, and I asked him to pull some strings at the ASA to put me in charge of the pods. 
 I'm gonna find out what's really going on with you, Doctor. 
 You're a liar. 
 You're Painkiller. So Garfield, that girl, they belong to the past now. 
 [groans] 
 This is not you. Jennifer, this is me. 
 [grunting] 
 [Tobias] Syonide was the only thing left in this world that I gave a damn about. 
 Time to die. 
 [screaming] 
 [jazz music playing] 
 [sighs] So, where were you? 
 Man, I was where she told me to be. Covering the exit. 
 Look, if I would've known... If you had known? 
 Negroes always fixing their thick lips with excuses. 
 You should have known, period. 
 [sighs] 
 Move. 
 You said you knew how to play. 
 I do. I just took your knight. 
 [chuckles] 
 [chuckles] 
 Listen carefully. 
 [grunts] 
 Check. 
 Actions have consequences. You have to anticipate. 
 [chuckling] 
 [groans] 
 [Tobias] Check. 
 [sighing] Move. 
 [chuckling] 
 Checkmate. You lose. 
 You let me take your queen, just like you let that bitch take Syonide from me. 
 [groaning] 
 [beeps] [alarm beeping] 
 [shouting] 
 [vomiting] 
 [shouting] 
 [alarm blaring] 
 [coughing] 
 [groans] 
 [gasping] 
 [Lynn] What's happening? [gasping] 
 [gasping] Kam. Kam. Kam. 
 It's okay. It's okay, Wendy. 
 It's okay. It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. 
 Just stay there. 
 Stay there. 
 [distorted chatter] 
 [gasping] 
 It's okay. We won't hurt you. Don't be scared. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 [distorted] It's okay, you can come to me. 
 [in normal voice] Come on, Wendy. 
 [wind whooshing] 
 [Wendy shouting] 
 [wind whooshing] 
 [grunts] 
 Somebody pull the video for that room. 
 I need to know what happened, now. Go! 
 ♪♪ Last night, I saw a superhero He was black ♪♪ 
 ♪♪ He said, "This is for the street, Black Lightning's back" ♪♪ 
 Jeff, trouble. 
 A boy woke up in a pod and basically killed himself and Kam. 
 In the process, he freed a girl. 
 What? 
 Wait. Are you all right? I'm fine... but this girl has been asleep for 30 years, then she wakes up in the middle of a horror movie and she gave us this look. 
 I think she's having a psychotic break, and she's hallucinating. 
 And Jeff, she's powerful. 
 [Gambi] It was her. Wendy Hernandez. 
 I was the spotter who ID'd her 30 years ago. 
 She was... Is a very smart young lady. 
 Just graduated high school and was heading to nursing school. 
 Wendy's power is aerokinesis. 
 She controls wind like you do electricity. 
 She can speed up a breeze into a full-blown hurricane. 
 Okay, we need to find her fast. 
 Issa Williams, AKA "Body Bag Boy." 
 His girlfriend called 911, scared out of her mind when he came to her for help. 
 The ASA picked him up outside of her house. 
 Why are you treating him like he's al-Qaeda? He's a 17-year-old boy. 
 Who died. At the hands of Freeland PD, for loitering. 
 Came back to life and ran away. 
 We need to know what we're dealing with, and you are the expert. 
 Wait, you... 
 You can't leave him with me. He has a family. 
 Who's afraid of him. 
 So much so that even his mother doesn't want anything to do with him. 
 Besides, we have to keep this quiet. We don't want him roaming the streets. 
 Agent Odell, this... You wanted the job. 
 This is it. 
 He's all yours. 
 [chuckles] 
 [Jennifer] Yo, you up? 
 [Anissa] Yeah, you wanna go for a run? 
 Nope. 
 Why are you running since you have super powers? 
 Because! The better shape I'm in, the longer I can hold my breath. 
 The longer I can hold my breath, the longer... 
 The longer you can stay super strong and invincible. 
 There you go. Girl, all you do is work. 
 Doing what I love isn't work, girl. 
 [chuckles] 
 You're just lucky your powers are only dangerous when you want them to be. 
 You're lucky, too. You're just not letting yourself see it. 
 [chuckles] Are you seriously still on the "it's a blessing" train? 
 How, Anissa? 
 I haven't gotten cramps with a period since my powers came in. 
 How 'bout you? 
 That's true, actually. Mmm-hmm. 
 See? See? These powers are a blessing from God. 
 Well, that part... That part is a gift because my cramps be doing the most sometimes, but... maybe it means I can't have kids. 
 Mmm-mmm. No. 
 Dad had powers, and here we are. 
 Yeah, but it could turn bad real quick if it becomes your only joy. 
 That's actually deep. 
 You need to get out more. 
 I'm stuck in here until the wardens release me, but... 
 Hey, hey. By the way, why do we have "wardens," plural? 
 I don't know. What's going on with Mom and Dad? 
 Are they getting back together? It's kinda cute. 
 I think I heard them the other night. 
 I heard them. 
 Good. 'Cause they've been walking around all emo, like they sexually frustrated. 
 They have. Yeah. [both laughing] 
 [Anissa sighs] 
 And listen. Relationships, they complicated. All right? 
 How would you know? You're not in one. 
 You don't even have anybody. 
 I'm just saying. You need to get back out there before you dry up. Okay, you know what? 
 Come here. Come here. Dry up. 
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry! 
 We're giving him lots of fluids. 
 Issa? 
 Issa. 
 Someone here to see you. 
 Tiff. 
 Hey. 
 How you doing? 
 I'm breathin'. 
 [sighs] My insides, feels like my damn blood's itchin'. 
 It's the withdrawal from Green Light. 
 We're working on something to help you with that. 
 How you doin'? 
 Hmm. 
 Right now, I'm... I'm thanking God for Dr. Stewart. 
 [sighs] 
 But you scare the hell out of me. 
 I'm not trying to take care of some... some zombie from the damn dead. 
 Tiff. [Lynn] Tiffany. 
 Why'd I say that? 
 I wanna walk away, and I never wanna see you again. 
 [Issa] No. Wait. Tiffany. 
 Tiffany. 
 Tiffany, wait.

 [applause] 
 [music playing] [indistinct chatter] 
 Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 Excuse me. 
 Here you go. 
 So, um, what happens when we finish staring at each other? 
 You tell me. 
 I say we go and sit, talk for a bit, get to know each other better. 
 I watch you say goodnight to your last guest, and then you sing me a song naked. 
 In heels, of course. 
 [chuckles] 
 Confident much? 
 Mmm. Well, you know, they say humility is the highest form of conceit. 
 Couldn't agree more. 
 Know what else has been said? What's that? 
 Those who dare... win. 
 Okay. [chuckles] 
 I like that. 
 [lively background chatter] 
 Uh-huh. I see you out here swimmin' like a black woman, tryin' not to get that hair wet. 
 It's too late for that. 
 You up and exercising already? 
 You know, I got a million songs and a closet full of heels. 
 That combination last night was epic. 
 But it's gonna have to last me for a while because I have a class I have to go to. 
 Class? Medical school. 
 [chuckles] 
 It just keeps getting better. 
 I have to go. 
 Okay, but are you sure? 
 I'll call my pilot, get the jet ready, we can have dim sum in New York. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 So you... You got it like that? 
 I do. Mmm. 
 That sounds amazing and like something I can get myself lost in, so I'm gonna go. Mmm-hmm. 
 [gasps] 
 Be that way. 
 But you have to come to a kickback I'm having tomorrow. 
 Maybe. 
 Okay, now, I don't play politics when it comes to Garfield. 
 His money is just as good as everybody else. 
 [Napier] A better look. 
 Of course. 
 There's no easy way to say this. 
 I'm listening. 
 The school board found your replacement. His name is Mike Lowry. 
 And they want him to take over when the school reopens next week. 
 But they wouldn't have their, uh... blackspert come all the way down here if that's all it is. 
 You keep on with that blackspert nonsense and see what happens. 
 Come on with it, Napier. [clears throat] 
 You're an icon in this town, Jefferson. 
 Uh-huh. [clears throat] 
 And they can't have you... criticize after the fact. 
 I volunteered to resign for the good of the school. 
 Why would I undermine that? 
 You can't even be reluctant. 
 You've gotta be 100%. 
 He's white. 
 Yes. 
 And the board... [scoffs] The board is afraid of the backlash from parents, students, the media because he is coming to a predominately black school playing the "white savior" role. 
 Yes. Come on, man. 
 You couldn't find another black person? 
 Someone who truly understands where these kids are coming from? 
 He's highly qualified, Jeff. 
 If he's so damn qualified, then why do I have to shuck and jive for Massah Lowry? 
 And tap dance and moonwalk. 
 This is a chance to save your reputation. No, no. 
 Don't spin me, brother. 
 We've known each other too long for that. 
 'Cause we've known each other, I'm reminding you, you didn't handle your business. 
 So now, tongues are wagging, and you need those tongues wagging in the right direction. 
 I'm your friend, bruh. 
 Get out of this alive. 
 All right? 
 You're just in time. What'd I miss? 
 I've cross-referenced Wendy Hernandez's movements with my file on her from when I was a spotter. 
 The store she hit on the first night... Mmm-hmm. 
 ...was where her mother used to work. 
 Ah. So she went straight to her mama. [sighs] 
 But both her parents have passed away, she didn't have any siblings, and all of her childhood friends are 30 years gone. 
 So, she is alone and lashing out. 
 Yeah, or worse. 
 Lynn suspects a psychotic episode complete with paranoia and hallucinations. 
 [Anissa] Hmm. 
 I've identified four locations that have either been torn down or repurposed. 
 The mall where she used to hang out, her old rec center, where her grandparents lived, and her best friend's apartment building. 
 I have cameras in place, and I am monitoring. 
 We need to find her quick. 
 Let's hit the streets. Let's do this.

 [knocking on window] 
 What are you doing here? 
 Just go away. No. 
 No, I'm not goin' anywhere until you come out here and you talk to me. 
 [gasps] 
 [grunts] [gasps] 
 Why the hell you do that? That was for killing Black Lightning. 
 But why you mad about that? 
 He saved me from The One Hundred. Did you forget about that? 
 Okay, J, look. Believe me, he's okay. 
 Hey, I didn't even mean to kill him on purpose. 
 I was just getting used to my own strength. 
 Do you think that explains everything? You attacked the school, Khalil. 
 You attacked our friends. I had to! 
 God, you don't get it, J. 
 Look, I'm caught up. 
 Tobias gave me legs. That means I have to do whatever the hell he tells me to, or else he will kill me, Jen. 
 Yeah. 
 I tried to forget you. 
 Really, I did. 
 But it doesn't work. 
 Look, I know. I know you have feelings for me, too. 
 Say you don't. 
 Say you don't have feelings for me, J. 
 See, you can't. 
 You can't because you... I'm gonna call the police. 
 What, you think I'm afraid of the police? 
 Khalil, get the hell out of here. 
 J... Now. 
 [sighing] [thuds] 
 [snoring] [indistinct chatter on TV] 
 How you feeling, Marsellus? 
 Tobias! It's so good to see you. 
 But you... 
 You don't have to chance it just to come down here to visit me. 
 Oh, man, it's nothing. 
 Nobody cleared your dinner? 
 Boss, please. 
 They take very good care of me around here. 
 I got the best money can buy, thanks to you. 
 Oh, it's the least I could do. 
 [chuckles] You got time for a game? 
 [chuckling] You don't want none of this. 
 Hey, I'm the one who taught you, remember? 
 How's your health? Good? 
 Well, I ain't got the fountain of youth like you do, but I'm good. 
 How's business? 
 Besides missing my right-hand guy, haven't been better. 
 [chuckles] 
 I wouldn't tell anybody but you, but I have a way to go international and make Freeland my own little Somalia. 
 Word. 
 Yeah, I'mma be the biggest arms dealer on the planet. 
 Guns and tanks and stuff? 
 Better. 
 Metahumans. 
 And I'm close. 
 Ooh, Marsellus, I'm real close. 
 [chuckles] 
 You've always been something, man. 
 I'm proud of you, brother. Proud of you. [chuckles] 
 Remember when we did that loud-mouth reporter? 
 [snapping fingers] Yeah. Yeah... 
 Pierce. 
 Alvin Pierce. 
 [laughing] Mmm. 
 You called him an Uncle Tom and made him eat every story he wrote until he choked on them. 
 [both laughing] 
 Oh, boy. I don't forget. 
 I was hoping you wouldn't... remember. 
 I'm a loose end. 
 I love you, man. 
 And I love you, too, brother.

 [Black Lightning] What're you doing? 
 [crowd cheering] 
 What are you doing? 
 We don't do this for the applause. 
 Dad, chill out. I know. I know that. 
 But there's nothing wrong with acknowledging the people. 
 Okay, so what's next? Thunder Instagram? Huh? Twitter? 
 [sighs] Come on, Dad, chill out. 
 [all cheering and applauding] 
 [indistinct chatter on TV] [pepper mill grinding] 
 Jennifer, that's enough pepper. 
 Thank you. 
 How much longer until dinner's ready? 
 Uh, about ten. 
 [Lynn] Hey, everyone. 
 This is Issa. 
 Issa, these are my daughters, Anissa and Jennifer. 
 And this is... Wow. 
 It's Jefferson Pierce. Nice to meet you. 
 Thank you for having me. You're welcome. 
 Um, could I use your guys' restroom? Yeah, of course. 
 Anissa, would you show our guest to the bathroom? 
 Yeah. Sure. I'll take you. 
 It's right over here. 
 You make yourself at home, okay? Thank you. 
 If the ASA knew he was here... Jeff, I couldn't leave him on his own when everyone else was leaving with their families. 
 Ooh, that smells good. 
 [lively chatter and laughter] 
 [Anissa] I know. 
 Jen, pass me the veggies, please. Yeah, sure. 
 Oh, by the way, you're gonna love those. 
 I put a little something-something in there. 
 Yeah, meaning pepper. 
 Lots of pepper. 
 Brace yourself. 
 [laughs and sighs] 
 What are you looking at, Body Bag Boy? 
 Jennifer. 
 I... I didn't mean to say that out loud. 
 [Issa] Nah. It's cool. 
 I miss my own family being together like this. 
 We were always saying crazy stuff. 
 Don't be too envious. 
 You could have a father who wants to control your every move. 
 I'm a grown-ass woman. 
 Then act like a grown-ass woman. 
 You're comin' off the deep end. 
 Jumping off cars, like a damn fool. 
 What's happening here? 
 What's happening is I feel trapped, like some sort of monster. 
 Might as well put me in one of those pods. 
 I wish everything would just go back to normal. 
 Stop whining, little girl. 
 I'm sick of it. 
 Issa, your jugular vein is twitching a lot. 
 Well, ever since I came back alive, when I'm around people and when I look at them... 
 it makes them tell the truth. 
 Okay, girls, excuse yourselves. 
 We need to talk. Yeah. Would you excuse us for a minute? 
 [Jefferson and Lynn arguing indistinctly] 
 Psst. 
 [Issa sighs] Your dad sounds pissed. 
 [Jefferson and Lynn continue arguing] 
 Yeah, he's just overreacting. 
 You sure about that? 
 Oh, yeah. I was supposed to be in therapy. This is it. 
 Hey, no more of that truth-teller stuff, all right? 
 I don't know how not to do it. 
 Me, neither. 
 Huh? 
 See. That's what I'm talking about. 
 Right there, you made eye contact, and then that thing twitched in your neck. 
 See, look away. Look away and ask me something. 
 [Issa] Um... 
 Uh, what? I don't care what. Anything. 
 What's your favorite color? 
 Red. 
 Really? 
 No. 
 Let's try again. 
 Um, do you like ice cream? I hate it. 
 Thank God, I can still lie. [sighs] 
 Yeah, the truth isn't always good. 
 Fastest way for me to get in trouble is to tell my parents a truth they don't want to hear. 
 Damn. 
 If I just walk down the street, I can cause major problems. 
 Might even get somebody killed if I get near a Hundred banger and he goes telling another banger what he's feeling. 
 Well, we just figured out how it works. 
 So work it. 
 [Lynn] Issa, where are you? 
 Okay, the warden's calling. 
 Oh, no. 
 [chuckles] 
 Oh, by the way, she don't know I'm out here, and she can't make you tell the truth. 
 You remember that? Yeah. 
 Thank you. [chuckles] 
 [upbeat music playing] [indistinct chatter] 
 [laughs] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 I want you to meet some of my friends. This is Chris. Hi. 
 Hey. This is Sarah. Hi. Nice to meet you, Sarah. 
 Hey. 
 [Grace] Hey. How you been? 
 Just peachy. 
 [chuckles] 
 Look, I'm sorry I haven't called in a minute. 
 Things have really been crazy. 
 I can tell. 
 I have to get back to work. 
 Detective Summers, how was your vacation? 
 I realized I don't like my wife and kids. 
 But thanks for lending me your home in the Caymans. 
 Next time, I'll bring my girlfriend. 
 Well, you've always been a good friend. 
 What you got for me? 
 [sighs] 
 Need anything else? 
 [sighs] No. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 [Jefferson] Okay, uh, can I have your attention, please? Excuse me. 
 Um, I'll be brief. 
 When the school reopens, I will be replaced as principal. 
 His name is... His name is Mike Lowry, and I'm sure he will introduce himself to you in whatever way he sees fit. 
 I thought I'd never see this day. 
 Yeah, well, none of us did, but at least you'll see it with tenure. 
 How could you do this to us? 
 Look, I wanna apologize for anything you've suffered because of the decisions I've made, I really do, but I'm confident that this is a good change and to everyone's benefit. 
 Trust me. 
 All right, thank you. 
 [all murmuring] 
 I got some lab results. 
 You definitely have the metagene, Issa. 
 The gene destabilizes the cells, then the cells change fundamentally, giving people powers. 
 But when the metagene is formed artificially, like yours was from Green Light... 
 the cells won't re-stabilize. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means, at some point, the cells in your body will break down. 
 So I'm gonna die? 
 Without a cure, yes... 
 but I'm working hard to find one. 
 What if you don't find it? 
 How long do I have to live? 
 Some people experience body failure immediately, but it could be six months or longer. We just can't tell. 
 I can put you in a pod to stabilize you. 
 I popped Green Light pills just a couple of times, and you're telling me my only choices are death... or to get in one of those pod things? 
 [sighs] 
 I'm sorry. 
 Jeff, I've got Wendy Hernandez. 
 She's at the old Freeland youth center. 
 You better get over there. 
 [whooshing] 
 [wind whooshing] [siren blaring] 
 [grunts] [tires screeching] 
 Go. 
 [groans] 
 I don't wanna hurt you. 
 [grunting] 
 [grunts] 
 [groaning] 
 [electricity crackling] 
 [groaning] 
 [panting] 
 Who are you? 
 A friend, Wendy. 
 I know someone who can help you. 
 [Lynn] You sure you wanna do this? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 I couldn't see myself stuck in one of those pods. 
 So I'm gonna stay out, for however long I have. 
 Don't miss any appointments, okay? 
 I won't. 
 Thank you, Dr. Stewart. 
 [sighs] 
 That boy's got a tough road ahead of him. 
 You sure he shouldn't be placed in a pod? 
 Like I laid out... this gives us the opportunity to study the subject in a natural environment, not in a lab. 
 Gotta do more than a study on this one. 
 If his talents can be contained, could be useful. 
 You went without me? You weren't around. 
 Okay, why didn't you call? 
 Why weren't you around so I didn't have to call? 
 Yeah, never mind. I can see the hickey on your neck from here. 
 You know what? Just tell me what happened to... 
 Young lady, you need to change your tone, quick. 
 [sighs] 
 What happened? 
 I lit her up. It shocked her out of her psychotic episode. 
 After that, she elected to go back into a pod while your mother figures these things out. 
 Wow, I... 
 I just don't know if I could do that. That's like... 
 Look... you may not be going into a pod, but if you don't tighten up your act, you're gonna end up in a casket. 
 Wow. 
 Get a new song, Dad, because this one's old. 
 Yeah... [sighs] 
 [Wendy sighs] 
 I'm scared. 
 You say a prayer, and you'll be asleep before you know it, okay? 
 [sniffles] 
 [door beeps] 
 [hissing] 
 [lively chatter] 
 [chattering stops] 
 [sighs] 
 I love Garfield High. 
 I loved it as a student. 
 Loved it as a teacher, and I have loved it as a principal. 
 But when the school reopens... 
 I will no longer be principal of Garfield High. 
 [boy exclaims] What? [girl] Why? 
 [crowd exclaiming] 
 Why? 
 [stammers] I need you to hear me. 
 I wanted to be the one to tell you so that you know that I... 
 I still have love for my students. 
 Okay, look. 
 It is a fact the school was attacked. 
 It's a fact that I... 
 That I was not here during the attack or its aftermath. 
 The board has decided that these facts are unacceptable, and they're right. 
 I accept full responsibility for the consequences of my actions, as I would expect from each and every one of you. 
 But I'm not going anywhere. 
 I am honored to remain at Garfield as a teacher. 
 And I will give my full support to the new principal. 
 Thank you... 
 for always teaching me. 
 [boy] Where's the future? 
 Right here. 
 [all] And whose life is this? 
 Mine. 
 [all] What are you going to do with it? 
 Live it by any means necessary. 
 [all cheering and applauding]
