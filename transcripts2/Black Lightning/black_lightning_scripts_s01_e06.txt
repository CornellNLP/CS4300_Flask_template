 [Lynn] You have to stop. 
 I can't keep letting you put yourself, or me through this. 
 I promise, no more. 
 [Jefferson] It has been nine years since I've even come close to using my powers. 
 [Gambi] Do you remember why you became Black Lightning? 
 You wanted to give the people hope. 
 [Anissa] Somebody has to do something, because all of this policing, and marching, and praying, it hasn't changed anything. 
 [grunting] 
 [Jefferson] It is time that people know that Black Lightning... 
 [grunts] 
 ...is back. 
 [Jefferson] Previously on Black Lightning... 
 [man] Thirty years ago, nine kids, all of whom displayed enhanced abilities, suddenly disappeared. 
 The reporter was Alvin Pierce. 
 Grandpa? - He was murdered. 
 You need to take Black Lightning out, 'cause if you don't my partners are gonna turn you into dust. 
 I found these on my student. 
 The only way I could keep him from hurting anyone was to blast him. 
 Must be this new drug, Green Light. 
 Khalil, your spinal cord is now completely severed. 
 You sayin' I'm not gonna walk again? 
 I've been waiting to knock you out since the sixth grade. 
 [groans] 
 Black Lightning is not making things better for the citizens of Freeland. 
 [Lynn] Is he back? 
 You know better than that. 
 I pray that's true. 
 Joey Toledo is back. Now, we're talking about the guy who worked for the man who killed my father. 
 Where is Tobias? I'm not telling you nothing. 
 [groans] 
 [grunts] 
 You should've stayed away.

 [siren wailing] 
 [groaning] 
 That's Black Lightning! Come on. Let's get out of here. 
 [siren wailing] 
 [Gambi] I'm here, man. 
 Are you with me? 
 [groaning] 
 Tobias is in Freeland, Gambi. 
 [groans] Tobias... Tobias is in Freeland, Gambi. 
 [tires screeching] 
 Breathe, Jefferson. Breathe! 
 [Jefferson groans] 
 [comms beep] Call Lynn Stewart. 
 [dial tone ringing] 
 [Lynn] It's Doctor Stewart. 
 It's Gambi. 
 Jefferson's in the hurt locker, and it's bad.

 [Joey wincing and panting] 
 Here you go. Thank you. 
 Cheers. [panting] 
 [chuckles] 
 What the hell happened to you? 
 I just fought Black Lightning. 
 I mean, one more minute and I would've killed him. I swear. 
 I mean, something's wrong with his head. He looked half-dead. 
 [chuckles] 
 So why didn't you finish him? 
 [choking] 
 I tried. 
 But I, but I was all on my own. 
 [stutters] And he trashed my gun and I couldn't take him. 
 I tipped our guy in the department. 
 [grunts] [sighs] 
 There was a time you could depend on white folks to be professional. 
 Nowadays white boys just as lazy and shiftless as the brothas. 
 [cell phone chimes] 
 Tori's protection team checked in on schedule. Hmm. 
 All is well. Hmm. 
 Tori's under protection? 
 Lady Eve sent me powder from ground albino bones, trying to mess with my head. 
 Or issue a warning. 
 [chuckles] 
 Yeah, and you're bleeding on my floor. 
 Sorry, Boss. 
 Make sure we got a crew in lockup on standby and let me know as soon as the cops get him. 
 Black Lightning doesn't live out the night. 
 [chief] I don't get it. We roll the cavalry, and he's gone. Disappears. 
 Eyewitnesses saw him get into a van. 
 Did you get a plate? Description of the van? 
 They were fans, sir. So, willful amnesia. 
 How does a criminal and a freak have fans? 
 Where'd you say you got that tip, sir? 
 I didn't. [cell phone vibrating] 
 I gotta take this. 
 [Jefferson] Look, I know I should've waited, but Joey Toledo has tried to kill me over and over again. 
 And he was Tobias's right-hand man. 
 I couldn't miss a chance to go after him. 
 I didn't get him, though. 
 What's that? 
 I brought a portable, took a brain scan while you were out. 
 And? 
 Anomalous, but normal for you. 
 If you did have a brain bleed, it's gone by now. 
 Your powers turbo-charged your recovery system. 
 May not heal as fast you used to, but it's still twice as fast as normal. 
 Well, it doesn't feel twice as fast. 
 It's good to be in your hands. 
 Stop it, Jefferson! 
 You're pulling me back into this mess, and I don't like it. 
 I hate this. I hate having to stitch you back together, living in fear of turning on the news and somebody finding your body dead in the gutter. 
 I watched Tobias murder my father. 
 He's here in Freeland, so what do you expect me to do? 
 I don't give a damn, Jefferson. 
 Your father is dead. 
 And nothing you can do is gonna bring him back. 
 Wow. 
 You have no idea what this does to me every time I see you like this. 
 [chuckles] It's too much. 
 It's... It's just too much.

 [indistinct chatter] 
 [blows whistle] 
 Shoot! 
 [crowd cheering] 
 [yelling indistinctly] 
 [officer 1] Back up. 
 [officer 2] Come with me. 
 Stay on the ground. 
 [indistinct yelling] 
 Get off of me. 
 [crowd clamoring] 
 Long night? 
 I just didn't sleep very well. 
 Because, you had company? Yeah. 
 Company named insomnia. 
 [scoffs] Boring. Let me show you something. 
 Aren't these the weirdest brain scans? 
 These are the scans of the Green Light addicts? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Gray matter should be dark, but it's lit up like a Christmas tree. 
 Have you ever seen, like, a scan like this before? 
 No. 
 [Lynn yawns] 
 Would you do me a favor and get me one of those coffees, please? 
 Sure thing, boss. Your usual? 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 This way. 
 [Jefferson] Here she is. 
 [groans] 
 Hey, maybe you shouldn't workout so hard. 
 No, I'm fine. 
 Thank you for coming to get me. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 [sighs] Damn, you stay getting arrested. 
 Shut up. 
 [Anissa and Jennifer speaking indistinctly] 
 You know, let me ask you a question. 
 Should I have you committed? Because you have obviously lost your damn mind. 
 That statue, Dad, is an insult to black people. 
 Glorifying a national traitor. 
 You broke the law, Anissa. 
 That gives the police an excuse to hurt you, and on top of that, you used guns. 
 Guns. They were water guns. 
 They looked enough like real guns to be the end of you. 
 [indistinct chatter on radio] 
 All it takes is for one cop, one cop to see your color instead of your humanity and decide, "better dead than sorry." 
 Look, you are a black woman. 
 You don't have the luxury of being naive. 
 I know, I know. You have said that like a thousand times. 
 Okay, then hear it. Okay. 
 And I will stop saying it. 
 Okay. 
 [sighs] 
 Look, I love you. 
 I don't want to lose you because you went along with something that you should have walked away from. 
 [softly] Okay. 
 [music playing over speakers] 
 Okay, so. 
 Biologically super powers are possible. 
 E equals MC square. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Mass is a function of energy. Mitochondria. 
 Mitochondria provide energy in human cells. 
 That's what this stuff from my grandfather is, research on human mitochondria that I don't know how to read. Great. 
 [sighs] 
 Are you talking to yourself in here? 
 What, did you hit your head or something when you were arrested, Harriet? 
 Okay, you know what? 
 Mess around and get hit in your head. Keep listening at my door. 
 Okay! Geez! When you get a moment, could you please check my Pre-Calc homework? 
 Lot of mouth to need a favor. Thank you! 
 [grunts and sighs] 
 All right, let me see, Jennifer. 
 Hmm. 
 I would be the only one in the family who's bad at math. 
 Mmm-mmm. Everybody winds up in the mud somewhere in math. 
 Plus eight. 
 Oh, here, it's perfect. 
 You knew that. [laughs] 
 Here. Boo-yah! 
 [both laugh] 
 What's up? You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Mmm-mmm. [laughs] 
 That was totally not convincing at all. 
 Is everything okay with you and Khalil? 
 I hate to say this or even think it, but... 
 I was so looking forward to dating and having a boyfriend and I used to dream about prom and going dancing. 
 Yeah. 
 [sighs] And, with Khalil, that can't happen the way you saw it. 
 All I can see in my future is struggling to help him get around. 
 You know, standing with him on the sidelines instead of actually being on the dance floor. 
 [sighs] And I'm awful for that. 
 No, listen. 
 You're human, with a hard choice to make, 
 that's all. 
 Okay. Draw in some energy. 
 [whirring and crackling] 
 How's that? 
 Good. 
 Right hand. 
 Left. 
 How's does that feel? 
 Good. 
 Real good. [sighs] 
 You know, sometimes I, uh, wonder if Lynn's right about my powers being a drug. 
 Endorphins is what you feel, that's all. 
 How's your head now? 
 Yeah, so far so good. 
 Your powers are largely neurological. 
 Your brain can pick up and use electricity the way a normal person picks up and uses a pencil or a hammer. 
 You sure there's no pain now? 
 I told you I'm good. Did you figure out what went wrong? 
 Well, we're screwing with forces of nature, Jefferson. 
 That suit of yours is what keeps you from blowing out your nervous system when you use your power and when the resistance is set too high... 
 There's feedback. 
 [sighs] That's what was wrong. 
 Okay. Thanks for fixing it. [chuckles] 
 Now, we got work to do. 
 Tobias is not on the run, he's right here in Freeland and I'm going to put his albino ass right in his grave. 
 Hey, slow down, Jefferson. 
 You're talking about cold-blooded murder. 
 You're Black Lightning, man. 
 A vengeful son is a far cry from a hero seeking justice for Freeland. 
 Freeland is in crisis because of Green Light. 
 Toledo is behind that. Tobias is behind him. 
 So ridding Freeland of Tobias is justice. 
 Maybe Toledo is behind Green Light. Maybe Tobias is, too. 
 What do you mean "maybe?" 
 If Toledo is around, Tobias is holding his leash. 
 I feel like every time I bring up Tobias to you, I get resistance. 
 Yeah. You're acting like you don't even want me to catch him. 
 [scoffs] That's ridiculous. 
 Is it? 
 You couldn't wait for me to get in the suit. 
 Now you're gun-shy about Tobias. 
 Why is that? 
 [sighs] There is no "why," Jefferson. 
 Uh, other than The 100 had nine years to get strong with no Black Lightning. 
 They've got state-of-the-art technology, political protection, lookouts on every other corner... 
 You know what? Save your history lesson. 
 I have lived with the murder of my father all my life. [sighs] 
 Tobias vanished without a trace once, and now he's right here under our noses. 
 I'm gonna take him out. 
 Period. 
 Good morning. 
 What do you want? 
 That's a little harsh, Lynn. 
 Well, you've never come by before. Now you break in. 
 [sighs] 
 I apologize. 
 I wanted to speak with you before your research assistant gets in. 
 Of course. 
 You know our hours. 
 I'm concerned that Jefferson is on the verge of crossing a line. 
 He crossed the line when he decided to go back to being Black Lightning. 
 Not like this. 
 He's going to kill the man who murdered his father. 
 You do something like that, you kill something inside yourself, maybe the best part. 
 You raised him to be Black Lightning. 
 His father raised him to be Jefferson Pierce, but he was formed on the streets of Freeland. 
 And no amount of education, or Olympics gets that out of you. He's complicated. 
 And no one understands him like you do, not me, maybe not even him. 
 So you might be the only one who can save him from himself. 
 You know what? 
 You and Jeff chose this, not me. 
 Leave me out of it. Lynn... 
 I have work to do. 
 [cell phone vibrates] 
 [Inspector Henderson] Usually we catch these guys when somebody talks or their habits. 
 [sighs] 
 There are some special health concerns that affect individuals with albinism. 
 Eye issues are a concern, and they suffer from a much higher incidence of psoriasis and skin cancer. 
 So regular screenings are a must. 
 Albinism is a complex disorder. You get your skin, hair and eye color... 
 Ugh, I am so done with her. Huh? 
 Look at what she just posted, look. 
 [Lana] Let's go. What you wanna do? 
 - Come on! Don't walk away from me! That's Jennifer Pierce, Miss Black Becky. Trying to talk like she's white 
 'cause she thinks she's better than everybody else. 
 [clicks tongue] I'm so done. 
 Hey, you shoulda beat her ass again. 
 Yeah, you're right. [school bell rings] 
 Let's go. 
 Hey, Mom. 
 Hey. Hope you don't mind me stopping by. 
 You know, I missed you at family dinner the other night. 
 Are you still coming or is it too weird between you and Dad? 
 Your father and I have been getting into it lately, but we'll be okay. 
 One thing's for sure, Dad's nose is wide open for you and it always will be. 
 [chuckles] That's not always enough, baby. 
 I get it. It's not meant to be. 
 What do you mean by that? 
 I used to hear you and dad arguing when I was a kid. 
 You did? I couldn't hear that well. 
 I just know you didn't like being the mistress. 
 Your father never cheated on me, Anissa. 
 Mom, Dad is married to saving the world. 
 You didn't like coming in second. 
 I get it. 
 I feel the same calling. 
 You don't know how right you are. 
 Is this for me? 
 No, it's actually for me. 
 So there's some lab results inside and a sample, but I can't make sense of it. 
 Well, where did you get it? Belonged to Dad's dad. 
 Call it a self-discovery project. 
 What is it you're not telling me? 
 [sighs] Never mind. 
 
 
 
 Your whole body just screamed like it did when you were a three-year-old. 
 Just promise you'll tell me when you can, okay? 
 I will. 
 I'll take a look at this as soon as I can. 
 All right. Thank you, Mom. Sure. 
 [computer beeps] 
 Jefferson... 
 I don't know what you're up to, but there is a difference between you and Tobias. 
 You need to keep it that way. 
 [door closes] [Henry] Who's there? 
 [gasps] 
 Do you know who I am? 
 You specialize in treatin' people with albinism. 
 Do you have an albino patient? 
 A gangster named Tobias Whale? 
 Okay, okay. 
 He never gives his name, but he has my home address. 
 He knows where my kids go to school. 
 Please, don't hurt me. 
 I have to treat him. I don't have a choice. 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 I'm not gonna hurt you, I'm gonna help you. 
 When's his next appointment? 
 He doesn't make appointments. 
 I get a call from this scary lady to stay open after I close. 
 I do, and he shows up. 
 All right, call her. Tell her you need to see him. No, I can't. 
 He'll kill us all. I know he will. 
 Look... 
 I can help you and your family. 
 But you gotta help me. 
 Or you can stay under his thumb. 
 But sooner or later, he will crush you. 
 Call me if you change your mind. 
 [school bell rings] 
 Jefferson. 
 Yeah. I know. I know, it's on my desk. 
 Good, but you know I monitor social media for cyberbullying of Garfield students? 
 Um... take a look at this. 
 Scroll down. 
 I'm around if you need anything. 
 Thank you. 
 [teacher speaking indistinctly] 
 Okay. Now. 
 Some people like to study roots... and suffixes... and prefixes. 
 Personally, I'm not a huge fan... 
 [Jennifer sighs] [knocking on door] 
 I'm guessing you already know what they're saying about me. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, Jen, a cultural aftershock of slavery... that sometimes when one black person gets ahead, another feels like it ruins their chances, so they lash out. 
 It's called "Crabs in a barrel." 
 Look, no one is an expert on what is or is not black because black is everything under the sun. 
 That actually backfired on her. 
 Hmm. 
 Lots of people jumped on her, saying that black people need to stop with the good hair, bad hair, light skin, dark skin stuff. 
 But it's the Khalil comments that bother you? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, he's a young man in a lot of pain. 
 Could be the pain talking, not the person. 
 Yeah, I was thinking that. 
 Or... 
 the pain could be revealing who he really is when things don't go his way. 
 How do I know which? 
 Well, you listen and stay honest with yourself about what you hear. 
 Right now, I would just give him some space. 
 I need to talk to him. 
 Yeah. 
 [Jefferson sighs] 
 [crowd chanting] You will not replace us! You will not replace us! 
 You will not replace us! You will not replace us! 
 This counter-protest began calling for the preservation of all history, but was hijacked by white nationalists. 
 It turned violent, then tragically, a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of students, killing 19-year-old Katie Smith. 
 Ugh. My goodness. 
 What, did you know her? 
 [sighs] 
 Not really, but I knew her. 
 So sad. 
 I just... I don't know. 
 Makes you wish there was something you can do to stop this madness. 
 Yo, you are trippin'. 
 Trippin'? Me? 
 [chuckles] You've been avoiding me. 
 I text you, you don't text me back. 
 But, what, you have the time to post shade? 
 [sighs] Maybe we should take a break. 
 Until what? 
 I walk? 
 If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have gone to that march and I wouldn't be in this chair. 
 Wow. Really? 
 So you're blaming me now? It's your fault, Becky. 
 [Khalil scoffs] 
 Hey, you got everything. 
 What I got? 
 Nothing. 
 You see, I did everything right. Yeah, I played by the rules. 
 No drugs, no alcohol, stayed out of jail, and had no kids. 
 [scoffs] 
 Hell, I went to church every Sunday and God still took my legs. 
 You can't see it that... 
 That's the only way to see it! Don't you understand? 
 [sighs] Khalil, I'll pray for you. 
 Yeah, well, you keep your damn prayers. 
 Now get out. 
 [Jefferson] Yeah? 
 Black Lightning, it's Dr. Mayfield. 
 I, uh... 
 I called. 
 Said he needed to come in to redo a test for psoriasis. 
 What time? After I close, at 6:00. 
 You're coming, right? 
 Definitely. 
 So, how'd it go? 
 I should've waited like you told me and given him space. 
 Can we please just go home? 
 Yeah. 
 [woman sobbing] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 [screams] 
 [people yelling indistinctly] 
 [sniffling] 
 [cell phone vibrating] 
 Hey, sweetie. I'm glad you called. 
 I inputted the organic sequencing from the data you gave me and cross-referenced it with known sequences. 
 That way, I can tell what it is and what it does. 
 I'll let you know when I have it. 
 Okay. 
 Mom, actually... 
 [sighs] 
 I'm calling because I need to tell you... 
 More like show you the real reason I need the research. 
 Can I come over? 
 Yeah. I'm still at the lab. 
 Just use the intercom when you get here and I'll let you in. 
 Bye. 
 [cell phone vibrating] 
 Yes? 
 [Gambi] Lynn, you have to get involved. 
 Please. He's about to kill a man. 
 [men grunting] [groaning] 
 [young Tobias] Hmm. 
 So you want to write about me? Huh, Uncle Tom? 
 It's time for you to eat your damn words. [gagging] 
 [whispers] Daddy. 
 [choking] 
 Daddy. 
 [groans] 
 [Gambi] Jefferson, I'm putting you through to Lynn. 
 [Lynn] June 28th, 1994 and October 7th, 2001. 
 Your daughters came into this world on those dates. 
 You're an amazing dad, their anchor in this world, but you can't be if you let the air out of your soul. 
 And that's exactly what will happen if you commit murder, Jeff. 
 It will shred your soul. 
 [breathing heavily] It's already shredded. 
 Goodbye, Lynn. 
 No, you think I don't understand. 
 I had some real talk with Anissa and I've been thinking. 
 I realize I was mad about not always being the first in your life. 
 But Black Lightning is part of you and I can't deny that just because I want Jefferson Pierce all to myself. 
 This isn't me fighting with you anymore. 
 I accept who and what you are. 
 This is about me reminding you that you're a hero. 
 Not a murderer. 
 [glass shattering] 
 What was that? 
 Someone's breaking in. They're coming this way. 
 Okay, hide. I'm coming. 
 [burglar] Did you get it? Come on. Hurry up. 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go. 
 Get away from her! [burglar] Stop! 
 [Thunder] Get away from her now! 
 Get on the floor! Get on the damn floor! 
 [gasps] 
 What? 
 You thought he missed? 
 [gasps] 
 [grunting] 
 [Black Lightning] Let her go. 
 [screams and grunts] 
 [gasps and grunts] 
 [both grunting] 
 [panting] 
 [groans] 
 Anissa? 
 [groans] What? 
 [Black Lightning breathing heavily] 
 [horn blaring] 
 No broken bones, but she has a concussion and quite a few bruises and burns. 
 What the hell was she doing? [Lynn sniffles] 
 What you do. 
 She has powers, Jeff. 
 Oh, God. 
 She has powers. 
 [Lynn crying] 
 She has powers. 
 [Tobias] Don't you worry about a thing. 
 I got you. 
 Just remember this and never forget. 
 There's two ways to walk in this world. 
 Either you're gonna be one of the sheep? 
 [chuckles] Oh, yeah. 
 Or you gonna be a wolf? 
 I think you made the right decision. 
 Thanks, Mr. Tobias. 
 But I don't know what I can do. 
 Better yet I can't even walk. 
 You will. I promise. 
 You will know strength, be strength, and believe me, it's so much fun. 
 [Gambi] Hello, Evelyn. 
 Peter Gambi. 
 How did you get past all my security? 
 Evelyn, I taught you everything you know, not everything I know. 
 [laughing] 
 You are so corny. 
 You get to be corny when you're technically retired. 
 If you had just gone into business with me after I left the Agency, you would be wealthily retired. 
 I wouldn't know what to do with it. 
 Point of clarification, the Pierce family is supposed to be off-limits. 
 That's the deal, right? 
 It is. 
 But Dr. Lynn Stewart is highly capable. 
 And she's been doing research that's off-limits. 
 We just wanted her files, that's all. 
 Didn't expect her to be there or the meta-human that attacked the Plummer crew. 
 What do you know about her? Anything? 
 No idea. 
 Don't make a mistake. 
 I would take out my own mother if I had to. 
 You made promises. 
 I know. I've kept my end of the deal. 
 I could've outed Tobias. 
 Didn't. That's fortunate. 
 Because if his dirty laundry comes out, so does yours. 
 [Lynn] Hey, honey. 
 [sighs] Hi. 
 [breathes heavily] 
 Dad?
