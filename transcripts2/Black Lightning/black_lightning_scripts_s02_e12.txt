 Previously on Black Lightning... 
 Hey, you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 What's happening? Told you what you needed to hear. 
 Fourteen of the vaccine kids will survive. 
 I got past the briefcase's firewall. Look. 
 I can't pinpoint exactly where they are, but there are four metas here. 
 Now it all begins. 
 I was the architect of the original vaccine program at Freeland. 
 When it ended, I went to Markovia to create a meta program for them. 
 I already know there's metahumans in the clinic. 
 But no one but me knows where they are. 
 You get these metas, and you will have more power than you ever imagined. 
 I told you I'd always have your back. 
 _ 
 _ 
 I'm sorry. I... 
 I just think Jen needs more space. 
 Khalil was her first love. She watched him suffer and die. 
 That's a lot. 
 It is a lot, and that's why I think we need to be there for her. 
 She said she wanted time to be by herself. 
 To smoke? 
 I know. 
 Look, she's cut way back since therapy with Perenna. 
 I think she wants time to be alone to be alone. 
 Well, alone is good until it's not good. 
 Isolation feeds depression and addiction. 
 I just think she needs her family right now. 
 You and Dad always think you know what's best for us. 
 But what if it's not true? 
 What if, every once in a while, we know what's best for us? 
 Anissa! Oh, my God. 
 Get off me! 
 Baby! Get off me! 
 No! 
 Anissa! 
 Oh, my God. Don't move. 
 I'm okay. 
 I just got the wind knocked out of me. You're bleeding. 
 I'm okay. I'm fine. I told you. 
 Okay. 
 Stay there. 
 Jeff? Hey. 
 So, we still stalling or can we go back? 
 We've been attacked. 
 Wait. What? Who? Where are you? 
 At the grocery store lot. 
 They've gone, but Anissa's hurt. No, I'm not. 
 Okay, get off the streets. Use the tunnels. 
 There should be an entrance off the subway platform around the corner. 
 Remember how to use it? I remember. 
 I'll meet you there. 
 I know he really loved you. 
 I loved him, too. 
 Oh. 
 I'm sorry, I have to get home, but... if you need any help planning the funeral, please call me, okay? 
 Jennifer, truth is... 
 I can't afford to bury him. 
 Barely even an inch in. 
 You must have instinctively held your breath and gone dense, stopping it. 
 But I still took the impact, which is what knocked the wind out of me. 
 I figured that out for myself. 
 I'm gonna put some ointment on it. 
 The only way Odell could have been there is if he has Lynn under surveillance. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 That means that he knows that... Not necessarily. 
 My system's doing a remote sweep for listening devices inside the house. 
 That probably means he's tailing you everywhere you go. 
 Well, why would somebody want to take Mom? 
 Sweetie, a lot of parents have their kids in pods, some of whom have died. 
 We have to think about Tobias. 
 Because of Khalil? 
 Because every messed-up thing that happens in Freeland could have Tobias behind it. 
 It could be Odell. 
 What? Playing us? So that she feels beholden? 
 Damn. 
 I should light his ass up. That is not a good idea. 
 I think Lynn should just go and talk with him. 
 Uh-uh. She's valuable to him. His actions show that. 
 And you don't get to answer for me, okay? I'm going. 
 What about the driver who got away? Already on it. 
 I've tapped into the video feed from the store parking lot. 
 All right. Well, let us know when you find him. 
 Make it quick. 
 Why are you having me followed? 
 Are you following my whole family? My research team? 
 And here I thought you were happy to be alive and came here to thank me for saving your life. 
 I do thank you. 
 How's your daughter? 
 She's fine. 
 They didn't shoot her. She fainted so it looked like they did. 
 Fortunate. 
 Dr. Stewart, you have been invaluable to the pod kids, but you're still not being honest with me, and I don't have time for it. 
 Kavanaugh. 
 Pods are all situated. Subjects inside are still breathing. 
 How is the crew that moved the pods? 
 Took a one-way trip with Cutter. 
 Nobody else knows about their location. 
 Excellent. 
 What's wrong with you? I'm good. I'm good. 
 No, you're not. Why's there a bandage here? 
 Because me and Mom got jumped, and I got caught slipping. 
 They shot me and almost kidnapped Mom. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Jen, I just... I just... I don't understand how I let that happen. 
 Anything could've happened to Mom. 
 It's not gonna happen again. No way. 
 Anissa, we're lucky she's still alive, okay? 
 I let Tobias kill Khalil. 
 Mmm-mmm. That is not on you. 
 How you doing? 
 How am I doing? 
 I don't know how I can be in so much pain and not bleed. 
 I don't know what it feels like to lose Khalil, but... 
 I know about pain. 
 Know this, Jen. 
 Pain doesn't make you weak. It makes you strong. 
 And loss, loss makes you appreciate. 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 Maybe someday. 
 You'll see. 
 I don't know. 
 I went to see Khalil's mom. 
 She's just a big ball of pain. 
 She can't even afford to pay for her own son's funeral. 
 I'm worried about Jen. 
 Yeah. Me, too. 
 She's grieving hard, Jeff. 
 I know. 
 She's craving vengeance just as hard. 
 Yeah, I know the look. 
 I know. She needs a distraction. 
 Gambi had me focused on history. We need to find something for her. 
 Maybe she could go back to school. She hates homeschooling. 
 No, no. If her powers come out... 
 She controlled them well enough to hide from us and Tobias. 
 Yeah, true, but... surrounded by all those teenage hormones, I don't know. 
 I think we should talk to Perenna. 
 At least if she goes back to high school, it might give her more of a chance to be normal. 
 What do you mean, "be normal"? 
 How the hell would I know? 
 I married you. 
 What did you just say? 
 Yes? 
 Dad, I'm ready to take down Tobias. 
 Give me a suit if I need one. I don't care. 
 Jen... 
 I have been going after Tobias for a long, long time. 
 It is not easy, okay? And it is very dangerous. 
 I don't care. He shouldn't be breathing, and I know I can change that. 
 Baby, you don't know what you're saying. 
 Yes, I do. 
 Jennifer, the power to do amazing things comes with the responsibility to do the right thing. 
 Revenge is not the right thing, justice is. 
 Ever heard of an eye for an eye? 
 For a guy like Tobias, revenge is justice. 
 I know how you feel. Baby girl, believe me, I do. 
 But I also know that our powers supercharge our emotions, and vice versa. 
 Khalil... 
 God rest his soul... he let his emotions get away from him and attacked his own school. 
 You don't want to make a similar mistake. 
 And I know... 
 I know he wouldn't want that for you. 
 Good evening. 
 We have a problem. 
 The Markovians are in Freeland, and they tried to kidnap Dr. Stewart. 
 They want her metahuman expertise. 
 I drew the same conclusion. Do they know I'm here? 
 Unknown at this time. Damn it. 
 We can protect you. 
 If? There's always an if. 
 Markovian intelligence is nothing if not ruthless and committed. 
 Good bet is they want the pod kids and they know where they are. 
 If you can safely move the pod kids, you will be protected and relocated. 
 Well, as much as I'd like to be out of here, I'd hate to see what happened if I disappointed you. 
 True, scientifically, I'm Beethoven, but Dr. Stewart is Mozart, and you'll need us both to keep the pod kids alive if you move them. 
 You scared me. 
 Is there something you want to say to me? 
 Look, you didn't want me in the suit. 
 And now Anissa's in one. Jen seems to be on her way. 
 So are you upset with me about it? 
 We're not doing this right now, Jefferson. 
 Come on. What? 
 We're not talking about this, okay? It is what it is. 
 There's... There's nothing to be gained by talking about it. 
 Fine. 
 Fine. I'm going back up. 
 Jeff... 
 I've made some choices that I would take back. 
 But you're not one of them. 
 And when you're not being a good man, you're a great man, and I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 Good night. Good night. 
 Kate said there's a new admit? 
 Wait. It's, uh... It's not on the clipboard. 
 Nope. Room three. 
 Hi. 
 I'm here to get you started, okay? 
 I'm Anissa Pierce. 
 I'm Monique. 
 Last name, Monique? 
 Just Monique. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna check your eye. Look straight ahead. 
 Now, I don't think that cut will need stitches. 
 Do you have a headache? 
 No. 
 Blurry or double vision? 
 No. Good. Good. 
 Now, how did this happen? 
 I don't know. I think I just fell down the stairs. 
 Sweetie, these don't look like fall-down-the-stairs injuries. 
 It's all right. You can talk to me. 
 I told you, I don't know. 
 Maybe I just blacked out or something. 
 "Or something"? 
 Now, are you sure you don't want to tell me who did this to you? 
 So I can get you some help? 
 I never said anyone did anything. 
 All right. 
 A doctor will be right in. 
 We don't log her in. 
 Why not? 
 She lives with this guy Rayvon. 
 He's a capo in The One Hundred gang. 
 We all look the other way, we all get to live. 
 It sucks but what can we do? 
 Metahuman target sighted. 
 Hey. 
 Thank you, boo. Thank you. 
 You're good. You can go. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 What's up? 
 Hi! Hey. How are you doing? 
 Hey. Hey, man. Good to see you. 
 Good to see you! You too. Hello! 
 Good to see y'all. 
 Oh, I'm so happy I gave you a key. 
 You still want to get some lunch, or you too tired? 
 Yes, I am not sleeping through my day off. 
 Wait... Where'd you get this from? 
 Um, the store I work in. 
 Wait. So they have Black Lightning comics? 
 Yeah. Thunder, too. 
 What? 
 Nothing. It's just, um... No, it's just cool. 
 Okay, give me one second and I'm ready. 
 Okay. 
 What? 
 All right, yo, listen up. That's your cut. 
 Get him! Get him, man! 
 I heard of you. 
 Yeah, the streets call you the Black Bird. 
 You know I can't just let you take this money. 
 I didn't come here for the money. 
 But thank you. 
 Rayvon. Get back, sis. 
 Now, I heard you like putting your hands on women. 
 Come on, put 'em on me. 
 Let me give you some advice. 
 Don't make me come back here. 
 Kill that bitch! 
 Hey. No, don't take this down. 
 Stop. Don't take this down. Please. 
 Principal says take it down. 
 Anissa. Mmm. 
 Anissa? 
 Tough night. 
 The kind where you have so much healing to do that you pass out? 
 Oh, I'm an idiot. 
 I'm doing all the things... 
 All the things Dad said would get me killed. 
 You wanna do good. I get it. 
 But you have to think of how much bad you'd do to your family if you lost your life. 
 Yeah. I am. 
 And what a waste it would be if you lost that life before you had a chance to really build it. 
 I'm so sorry. Thank you. 
 We're with you. Condolences, Jen. For real. 
 Let's go. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 What's this doing here? 
 It's a memorial for a student from here who died tragically. 
 I know what it is. It's inappropriate student decoration. 
 And you can review your student handbook after you take it down. 
 You can hide behind the handbook and all your rules, but the fact of the matter is you just don't like him. 
 Or any of us, do you? 
 This isn't a debate, young lady. Okay, let's go, everybody. 
 Back to class. Come on. The hell it ain't. 
 Because whether you like it or not, black lives matter. 
 Khalil's life mattered. 
 You're out of line. 
 You're a racist. Yeah. 
 Okay, isn't that convenient. 
 When you want to win an argument, yell "racist." 
 Yet, this is a monument to a gang member who attacked the school. 
 Now, you take this down right now, or I'm gonna have you removed and it destroyed. 
 You can't remove him from us. 
 You can't make us not remember him. 
 Every single person standing here is just one bad break away from becoming somebody they never meant to be. 
 This is your last chance. 
 
 
 
 Can anyone here say that if they were crippled and you had the opportunity to walk again, you wouldn't take it? 
 We're all in pods. You know that, right? 
 Just like the kids on the news, right? 
 Trapped by a system that doesn't give a damn about us, run by people like you. 
 Yeah! 
 Take her. 
 All right, come on. 
 Clear a path. Let's go. 
 No, it's okay. Stay strong, everyone. 
 No, no, no, no, no. No kneeling down. 
 And let's put the cell phones away. 
 Put the phones away. 
 You know this is an illegal assembly, right? 
 You are in violation of your student handbook. 
 Will you tell them to get off their butts and back to class? 
 Sounds like the principal's job. 
 Are you kidding me with this crazy bitch? 
 Why the hell would you let somebody that disturbed out of prison again? 
 Well, hello to you, too. I'll make sure she behaves this time. 
 We don't need her. 
 In a few months, the pod kids will be at 100%. 
 If you were able to continue the present course. 
 And I'm afraid we can't. The pods need to be moved, and Dr. Jace's sims are needed again to stabilize the subjects for that move. 
 And, of course, your expertise is required as well. 
 I told him that because it's true. You can thank me later. 
 So you're moving them whether I help you or not. 
 Affirmative. 
 You... 
 I didn't believe you were real. 
 It's for Khalil's funeral. 
 You play any games with that money, and I'll be back. 
 Here. 
 Where's Anissa? I don't know. But this couldn't wait. 
 The driver on Lynn's kidnapping attempt... 
 Yuri Bakonov. 
 He's a member of the Markovian Intelligence Service. 
 That's in Eastern Europe, right? It's been in the news. 
 Well, because they're especially ambitious and brutal. 
 Okay, so why would Markovia want to kidnap Lynn? 
 You can ask him yourself. 
 I traced him to a storefront leased to the Markovian government. 
 Satellite shows only five guards, lightly armed. 
 Then, he's mine. 
 Kill him! 
 Uh, excuse me for a minute. 
 Yeah? 
 Hey, I got something for you. 
 Well, actually, someone. 
 We're talking attempted murder and kidnapping. 
 Just had the first of his three surgeries. 
 When he gets home, Monique won't be there. 
 I had a follow-up with her on your day off. 
 She's moved out. 
 She's getting counseling, making herself a new life. 
 Wow. 
 Nice. 
 Everything seems to be in order. 
 You called security on my daughter. 
 Give this to Jamie in accounting. 
 Did you come here to hit me? 
 All you had to do was come get me. She was being disruptive. 
 To make matters worse, she called me a racist in front of a hallway full of students. 
 I had to take steps, and I may have to take more. 
 Suspending her will not make the point that you want to make. 
 Now, Jennifer is just questioning whether you have the perspective and the sensitivity for this community. 
 So are a lot of kids and teachers. All right. 
 You know what? Let's be honest with each other right now. 
 Okay, you assume that because I'm white, I had a better life than you. 
 And that is the most racist idea out there. 
 No, no, no. Your father was a respected journalist. 
 Mine was a heroin addict, and my mother OD'd while my father watched. 
 But you get a benefit of the doubt that even a rich black man will not get. 
 That's what these kids are facing. 
 You know what? I don't feel sorry for these kids. 
 I don't. I really don't, because I had to sleep in the streets and eat dog food. 
 Dog food. Yet nobody feels bad for me. Why? Because I'm a white guy. 
 And the white guy in America today can go to hell, and nobody gives a damn. 
 Good talk. 
 Okay, next time I pick the movie. 
 What? You didn't like it? It was so violent. 
 I love watching a woman kick ass. How about nobody kicks ass? 
 Oh, my God. Look. 
 Hey, you mind if I rope? Go ahead. 
 Whoo! 
 Wow! 
 I'm sorry. You hear me complaining? 
 I admire your ability to be so spontaneous and just, you know, plain thirsty about life. 
 Ah. Well, clearly you're a deep person. 
 Can't wait to get to know you better. 
 Wait. You're the one who's always running off without an explanation. 
 And I never press. I always respect your privacy. 
 Okay. Hold on. Maybe that came off wrong. 
 The last thing I want to do is fight with you right now, okay? 
 Hey. Your eyes, they change color? 
 Huh? What? 
 You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. 
 No, they're the same. For a second, I thought they were lighter. 
 Yeah, I guess it was the light. 
 Hmm. Hey... 
 I've been thinking a lot about us. 
 And I want you to meet my family. 
 Can you come to dinner? 
 No. No, sorry, I can't make it. 
 Babe, I haven't even said when. 
 Anissa, when I am with you, I can't control myself. 
 I know, and it is amazing. 
 No, you don't understand. 
 Then, explain it to me. I'm here. I'm listening. 
 I have to go. 
 Did I say something wrong? 
 Grace! What did I do? 
 There are tactical teams jumping folks in Freeland. 
 Anything about that on the briefcase? 
 Not so far. But I do got something to show you. 
 So, according to the briefcase, this correlates in time with a metahuman research program held at... 
 Leavenworth. Then the ASA took their successful subjects. 
 Yeah. Well, those subjects were blacked-out operatives for a time, but they committed atrocities. Which never came out. 
 They couldn't have had a vaccine scandal and war crimes. 
 Fingerprints are a match. 
 Those Leavenworth subjects turned covert assets? 
 They're the exact same people inside those pods we took out of that clinic basement. 
 Perfect. 
 Good work. 
 Yeah. 
 _ 
 We should go. No. 
 Jennifer... 
 I can't do it. I can't see him lowered into the ground. 
 Jen... Baby... 
 You need to keep calm. 
 I'm not getting out. 
 If I stay in the car, then it won't be real. 
 Baby... No. 
 Look at me. 
 No matter how much the world hurts, you're still a Pierce. 
 You say yes. We say yes. 
 We say yes because it matters. 
 We say yes because we honor those we love, because we're loyal to their memory, because we do not give up on them or ourselves. 
 Right? 
 Yes. 
 Grace? 
 Grace, it's me. 
 Are you sure about this? 
 I mean, before they were metas, these were convicted murderers. 
 Homicidal psychopaths. They're the worst of the worst. 
 How soon before you get these cans open? 
 Actually, I have no idea. 
 Excuse me? 
 Boss, this tech is ancient. 
 I mean, literally nuts and bolts. 
 Thing belongs in a museum. I have no idea what to do with it. 
 I know who does. Abort the order to cancel Dr. Jace. 
 We're gonna have to make her a more permanent guest. 
 I'm gonna make him pay, Khalil. I promise you that. 
 I'm gonna put Tobias Whale in the ground. 
 Just like you are.
