 ("I wanna be loved by you" by Marilyn Monroe) 
 ♪ I wanna be loved by you ♪ 
♪ And you and nobody else by you ♪ 
♪ I wanna be loved by you alone ♪ 
♪ I wanna be kissed by you ♪ 
♪ And you and nobody else by you ♪ 
 Marilyn : (Worried sighs) 
 Whitey : Don't worry. I'll cover the crows feet. 
 Marilyn : No. I've earned them. (Doorbell rings) Oh shoot, that's him! 
 Whitey : Let's finish getting dressed. 
 Alan : Hello, I'm Dr. DeShields. 
 Pat : Pat Newcomb. Marilyn's publicist. 
 (Nervous pant, papers rustle) 
 Marilyn : Oh! Got 'em! 
 "Would you consult with my other therapist?" 
 ♪ I wanna loved by you alone ♪ 
 Oh! "Do you usually prescribe medicine? And how often would the sessions take place, doctor?" (Sighs) I can't do this.  (Singsong) Dis moi. Oh, mon coeur! 
 (Groans) 
 Whitey : I like the dusty rose. 
 Marilyn : Should I wear a dress? 
 (Frustrated groan) 
 ♪ I couldn't aspire ♪ 
♪ To anything higher ♪ 
♪ Than to fill a desire ♪ 
♪ To make you my own! ♪ 
 Whitey : "Do you usually prescribe medicine?" 
 Marilyn : "Do you usually prescribe medicine?" Right. "Are there complimentary or other therapies that I should consider?" 
 (Knock on door) 
 Pat : Marilyn, honey, I can't keep... 
 Marilyn : Oh, just tell him five more minutes, Pat. Please. What's next? 
 Whitey : Sessions. 
 ♪ By you alone... ♪ 
 Pat : Well... 
 Alan : (Sighs) It was a pleasure to meet you, Miss Newcomb. 
 Pat : Oh, she'll be out in a few. 
 Alan : Well, it's been an hour and a half. 
 Pat : Oh, won't you stay, please, just a few minutes more. 
 Marilyn : Well, here I am... The late Marilyn Monroe. Uh, that... the inscription on the latin tiles out front... Was nice. 
 Marilyn : Nice? Oh, good. Well, it was there when I moved in. It means "I complete the course." But... well, I hope I'm just beginning. 
 (Coffee pours) 
 Marilyn : Thank you, Mrs. Murray. (Lighter snicks, then clicks shut) I've been in psychoanalysis for the past seven years. And instead of becoming happier, I've become progressively more miserable. Dr. Greenson has me lying on this couch every day for the past two years. So what can you do for me that he couldn't? Well, for one thing, give you a day off. You must be exhausted. 
 Marilyn : Are you Freudian? 
 Alan : I'm concerned with brass tacks, Miss Monroe. And I've never seen a picture of Freud without a cigar in his mouth. (Both chuckle) Well, you're not what I expected. 
 Alan : Is that good or bad?  Well, I don't know yet. What do you mean by "brass tacks?" Functionality. Being able to handle the demands of day-to-day living without nembutal, demerol, phenobarbital... 
 Marilyn : Who told you that? The studio? 
 Alan : It's a small town. 
 Marilyn : Well, I was never anything but professional. Oh! And they've made millions off of me. Brass tacks also means having respect for other peoples' time. So... how would you like to approach your therapy? I mean, if we continue. Well, I'm not quite sure if Freudian psychiatry is right for me. I'm sick of dredging up things that are in the past. And I don't want to think about them. "Everyone's childhood plays itself out." (Sighs) Well, my mother gave me away when I was two weeks old. And I never met my father.

 (Door slams shut) 
 Gladys : Ida Bolender! (Frustrated exhale) You have no right stealing my daughter!  She's mine! 
 Ida : Gladys, dear, calm down. Gladys : Oh, adoption is theft and I will not abide it! Norma Jeane! Ida : Gladys, you calm down now, you're not making any sense! (Running footsteps, door slams shut) (Banging on door) Ida : Gladys, you open this door right now! (Footstep thud, banging on the door) (Rattles door knob, banging on the door) Ida : Gladys, open this door! Gladys : Norma Jeane? Mother is here. (Panting) Ida : Gladys, what have you done?! Gladys : She's mine! She's mine! Ida : Let it go! Gladys : No! Ida : Let it go! Gladys : She's mine! No! No! Norma Jeane : Mama. Mama, mama, mama. (Emotional exhales) (Running footsteps) Ida : I'm not your mama. Please don't call me that. (Kiss) (Car door slams) You can call me Aunt Ida from now on, Norma Jeane. (Car engine roars) Alan : Did the adoption go through? Alan : What was wrong with her? Marilyn : She lost her job. She couldn't afFord to pay Aunt Ida that five dollars a week. Would you have liked to have stayed at the farm? My Aunt Grace... my mother's best friend... she came and got me. And then she took care of the both of us. Grace : Gladys! (Door creaks shut) Gladys, honey, we're home. Wait there. (Footsteps thud) Be nice if you were sitting here when she woke up. No? All right. Come here. Grace : You like that picture? Norma Jeane : She's pretty. Grace : Well, maybe today we can go see her... (loud scream, glass shatters) Gladys! Oh my god. Honey, go next door, get them to call the police. Call an ambulance! Gladys, sweetie... It's okay. Gladys : No! Don't! Don't touch me! (Wails) Help! Can somebody help me! I need help in here! Gladys : No! (Children shout in the distance) Norma Jeane : I don't want to stay here. Grace : Oh, it's not going to be for long, I promise. Norma Jeane : When is mother coming back? Er inot gonna be home for a long time, honey. She's sick. But I'm not an orphan! I'd take care of you, but I have to work. There's no one to look after you. Norma Jeane : I can look after myself. Or go back to Aunt Ida's. Grace : Next week when I come visit, I'll bring more of those. I promise. Oh. Here. I'll come get you as soon as I can. Marilyn : When I used to wake up... Well, sometimes I'd think I was dead. Alan : I understand. Marilyn : I don't think so. I don't want platitudes, Doctor DeShields. Well, if it wasn't for Grace, I wouldn't be where I am today. She would come and visit me on Saturdays... Well, most Saturdays. (Cars honking, engines hum) Grace : Jean Harlow. Here she is, look. Norma Jeane : Wow. Grace : (Gasp) Wow. One day you'll have your footprints here. How would you like that?  Oh, Norma Jeane, god gave you that smile, and that sweetness.  He gave them to you so you could share them with the world. How would you like to go see mother now? At the hospital? No, she's out. She's rented a bungalow a few blocks from here. She said she wanted you to spend the night with her. (Sirens, shouting outside, dog barking) (Knock on door) (Knock on door) Gladys : What are you doing here? Mike : Hey, Gladys. Gladys : Shhh! Daddy, you're all bent. Mike : How's my favorite doll? Gladys : Shhh, don't wake up my daughter. Mike : I didn't know you had a daughter. Gladys : She's in the bedroom. (Passionate kissing) Norma Jeane, this is Mike. Uncle Mike. Mike : Hi, honey. Gladys : Here. You're going to sleep on the couch for a little bit. Mike : You behave yourself, Uncle Mike will give you a quarter. Gladys : It's only for a little while. Mike : Here. Norma Jeane : I don't want it. (Coins clink) Okay. (Playful laughter) Gladys : You're terrible! Mike : You love it! Mike : Pass it over here! Gladys : Oh, the hooch makes you crazy, Mike! She let me come back to bed... To those cold, wet sheets... Smelled like s*x. It's not her fault. She's been lonely and... Loneliness is the most uh... Did your mother's promiscuity affect your own relationships with men? Well, I have wonderful relationships with men. As long as I'm not married to them. Norma Jeane : My Aunt Grace introduced me to my first boyfriend, Jimmy Dougherty.  (Low hum of chatter, laughter) (Approaching footsteps) You know, I have this picture practically memorized. Jimmie : Oh yeah? Well, why do you want to see it again, then? Norma Jeane : Bette Davis is so wonderful. Candy vendor : Cigarettes, candy...  Cigarettes, candy... Movie goer : You have gum? Candy vendor : Sure, honey. What flavor? Movie goer : What've you got? Candy vendor : Spearmint, peppermint... Movie goer : Anything else? Candy vendor : Wintergreen, juicy-fruit... Movie goer : Juicy fruit. Candy vendor : That's my favorite. I love how the flavor just explodes in your mouth. (Stifling a laugh)  Cigarettes, candy... Cigarettes, candy... Norma Jeane : Don't you ever dream of just... Floating up there with the stars? Jimmie : There's no oxygen. Without oxygen you'll die. Norma Jeane : Without dreams we'll die. Without dreams we're just... Jimmie : Stop trying to talk like that lady. Norma Jeane : (Chuckles) Aunt Grace says if you want to be in the pictures... Jimmie : Is that what you want? You want to be in the pictures? Norma Jeane : Well, of course, silly. Jimmie : Why? Norma Jeane : 'Cause if you're in the movies you'll be famous. And if you're famous everyone will love you. Jimmie : What if only one person loves you? Would that be so bad? Norma Jeane : No. Jimmie : Oh, come on Norma Jeane. Why not? (Norma Jeane giggles) Jimmie : Open your mouth. Norma Jeane : Don't be cross. I'm just... (Baby-doll voice) Oh, please take your coat off. (Giggles) The heat's paid for this month. Oh... (Giggles) Well, what do you think? Does it make me sound distinctive and alluring? (Door creaks shut) Grace : Doc's company is transferring him... to Virginia. Norma Jeane : Oh. Grace : I want you to come with us, but Doc says you're too... He doesn't want you with us. (Exhales) Oh... Well, where will I go? Grace : Well, you're too young to be on your own, so... Just have to go back. Norma Jeane : Back where? No, Aunt Grace, please! Please, don't make me go back! I hate the idea as much as you. There's one other thing I can think of... Norma Jeane : What it is, please, I'll do it! Please. Grace : You're sixteen. That's the legal age. I could talk to Jimmie's mother... Norma Jeane : About what? Grace : You could get married. (Scoffs) Marry Jimmie? He's a good christian boy. You get along... Norma Jeane : Well, sure, I like him... Grace : So I could talk to his mother? Norma Jeane : But I don't love him. Grace : No, but... well... Love can come with time. Norma Jeane : But we don't... He makes fun of me when I talk about being in the pictures. This isn't about being in the pictures! If you don't want to go back to that terrible place,  there is no other option.  I'm really sorry, honey, I... I wish there was something I could do. Norma Jeane : Aunt Grace...  Well, I'll marry him then. Good girl. (Door creaks open then shut) (Sobs) (Birds chirp) Gladys : What? Norma Jeane : On the nineteenth. Grace : She'll be a beautiful June bride. Norma Jeane : Will you give me away? Grace : I know the boy's family. They're good christian people, Gladys. Gladys : This is what you want? Norma Jeane : Yes. Yes. I'm surprised. And very disappointed. Very disappointed. I would no more give you away in marriage then I would sell you into slavery. You must never give yourself over to a man's carnal desires. Carnality is disease. Grace : Gladys... Gladys : All men carry it. My father died of it. It's filth! Norma Jeane : Mother. Norma Jeane : Mother. Grace : She doesn't realize what she's... Gladys : Don't you bear false witness against me! I know what you're trying to do, Grace McKee! You've always wanted her for yourself  because you're barren just like Ida!  Bearing false witness is not going to work. And you... I am telling you this for your own salvation! For your salvation. It's for your salvation. For your salvation... Minister : You may now kiss the bride. (Applause) (Passionate kissing, moaning) (Light thud) Ooh! (Heavy breathing) Norma Jeane : Okay, no Jimmie... Jimmie it's okay... You're my wife. Right? (Passionate kissing, moaning) Norma Jeane : No. Wait! Please... No, no, please. I can't...  I'm so afraid... Marilyn : The effect of my first marriage? Well... It increased my lack of interest in s*x. Alan : Is that still true? Marilyn : Oh, I'm the world's biggest s*x symbol, doctor. I should hope not! Mrs. Murray! (Labored breathing) (Calming exhale) If I'm going to be a symbol of something I'd rather have it be s*x than some other things they've got symbols of. But I do wanna be an artist, not some erotic freak. (Relaxed exhale) Alan : How did Jimmie feel about your "lack of interest"? Marilyn : Oh, Jimmy... Well, he joined the merchant marine. Alan : How'd you feel about that? Marilyn : It was the war. Norma Jeane : I can't believe it's only lunch. It's been the longest day of my life. Defense plant worker : Come on, it can't be that bad. (Small laugh) I heard that man over there is putting pictures of girls in an army magazine. Norma Jeane : What do you mean? Defense plant worker : Oh, go on. I would if I had your looks. Norma Jeane : (Shy laugh) I could never... (Shutter clicks) Photographer : Just uh, look to your left. Okay. (Shutter clicks) Nice. And chin down just a little bit. How old are you, honey? Norma Jeane : I'm eighteen. Photographer : Well, if you can get someone to sign for you, I'm pretty sure I can get you into an agency. Really? Photographer : Yeah. Norma Jeane : Oh. Photographer : Yeah. That's it. (Shutter clicks) Nice. Have a little fun. (Shutter clicks) (Shutter clicks) (Car rumbles) Norma Jeane : Mother! (Slams door) How'd you know where I lived? Oh, never mind... you're here. Gladys : What did you do to your hair? Norma Jeane : Oh, I lightened it. Do you like it? Gladys : I like your car. Norma Jeane : Ha. I'm so glad you can stay.  We're going to have such a good time.  Walls should be white. Walls should be white. Better. They should be white. Norma Jeane : I'll paint them. Gladys : Hm. That would be better. (Whispers) Better. (Whispers) That would... better. Norma Jeane : I'm with an agency now.  This month I've been on seven covers. Look. That's me. (Chuckles) Yeah.  See, there's my darker hair.  This is a, a sinful business, Norma Jeane. This... (Taps the magazines) This is a sinful business. That's not what god intended for you to do with your life. People in that business, eyhey'll lead you astray. Norma Jeane : Yes, mother. Trade ya. I'll... Ii'll be in the other room if you need me. Walls should be white. Better. (Phone buzzes) Norma Jeane : Hello. Jimmie : It's Jimmie. Norma Jeane : Oh, Jimmie. Jimmie : Guess my comin' home was only important to one of us, huh? No, it's uh... Well, it's that my mother just got here. I been waitin' at pier six for two hours. Well, I can't just leave her... Jimmie : Why not? She left you often enough. She's tired.  She's been traveling for so long.  What do you think I've been doing, Norma Jeane?! Will you please try to understand... I'll take the damn bus! Jimmie! (Dial tone) (Scoffs) (Ship's horn bellows) (Pages ripping) (Gladys mumbling) Norma Jeane : Jimmie got his leave. Oh no, no, no... No, no, no... Well, I hoped you'd be happy for me. Gladys : You can't hide from the lord. You've fallen away, Norma Jeane, but he will forgive you. Norma Jeane : (Sighs) Would you like- Gladys : Sugar. Norma Jeane : Oh. I'm sorry. (Spoon clinks) (Clock ticks loudly) (Chuckles) Oh boy, did you make a mess. Gladys : He will forgive you. (Cutlery clinks against the plates) Gladys : Do you believe in jesus Christ, our savior? Jimmie : Yes, ma'am. Gladys : Do you trust him? Norma Jeane : Jimmie? Gladys : There's something about his eyes. He doesn't-he doesn't belong to them, does he? Norma Jeane : Well, sure he does. You shouldn't worry yourself about such things, mother. Good night. Gladys : If you hear them, turn off the lights. Norma Jeane : Who? Gladys : The voices. They don't like the dark. Norma Jeane : I don't hear voices. (Sighs) Sleep tight... And don't let those bedbugs bite. (Moaning, passionate kissing) Jimmie : (Chuckles) Oh gosh, you're pretty. Norma Jeane : Stop it. Jimmie : You are. (Moaning, kissing) Come on now. Norma Jeane : No, Jimmie, mother's in the kitchen... Gladys : Norma Jeane. Norma Jeane! Are you... Jimmie : Hey! Norma Jeane : What are you... what... Mother! Hey! Put it down! I said put it down!  Gladys, stop it! Put it down! (Knife clunks on the floor) Norma Jeane : Stop, please. She was just trying to protect me. Police officer : Has she, uh, ever been evaluated? I mean, in an institution or... Gladys : I voted socialist in 1924, they're just trying to get even! Police officer : "They"? Gladys : The owners, stupid! Police officer : Anyone else in the family have a history of an mental illness? Norma Jeane : No. Yes, her mother died in an institution. Gladys : Liar! You liar! Arrest him! Jimmie : See? Look at her! She's completely off her rocker! Norma Jeane : Stop! Gladys : That's not true! Police officer : All right, lady. Gladys : What? Who are you? Police officer : Come on, lady. Do you own Los Angeles or something?! Police officer : Yeah, every square inch. Please don't! Stop! Mother, we'll come and get you! Norma Jeane : Don't hurt her! Gladys : You work for me, you know, you supposed to be working for the people... Jimmie : What? Gladys: Let go! You know some people can't help who they turn out to be. Gladys : This is a free country and I can vote however I want.  Just wait until I get to the phone. You're gonna be in so much trouble. (Pulls on the door handle) (Rattles door handle, bangs on door) Jimmie : Hey, what now?! Come on! Open this door! (Pounding)  There's no one to hear us now, Norma Jeane, come on!  I'm not gonna say it again.  All right. I'm coming in! (Thuds repeatedly) (Burst thought the door) (Dogs bark in the distance) (Sighs) (Door opens and shuts) (Running footsteps) (Rapid breathing) Norma Jeane : There was a man... and he was following me outside. When I came back here, I saw him standing in the doorway. Jimmie : You did not. Norma Jeane : Daddy, he was there. Jimmie don't call me that! Right. Now look, the only man in this house is me. Your husband. I just want his wife to act like a wife. Is that so much to ask, honey? Norma Jeane : Daddy! There is a man! I saw him! He's after me! Jimmie : If that's what you think, you're as crazy as your mother! I'm taking you to the same place, let those head doctors take a look at ya. Norma Jeane : You can't do that! Jimmie : Oh yes, I can, Norma Jeane, first thing in tomorrow morning! We're gonna get this straightened out once and for all! I'm sick of it! (Sighs) Norma Jeane : Daddy, you're probably right. It was just my imagination. You know, the shadows and everything... (Kissing, heavy breathing) Screen test director : Okay. You're gonna pretend you've got a man with you... You're gonna give him that drink. Roll camera. (Nervous exhale) And action. (Low hum of the camera) (Liquid pours) I hope this is dry enough. We can get wet... later. Screen test director : It's a silent test, honey. Norma Jeane : Oh! It helps me get in the mood. Screen test director : Now walk over to the window.  Look like you don't know when you're gonna see him again.  (Heavy breaths) And cut. Norma Jeane : (Exhales) Thank you. Was I all right? Screen test director : We'll send it to Mr. Lyon.  Head of casting.  Norma Jeane? Oh. Screen test director : Who knows? (Happy exhales) Norma Jeane : Thank you. It was nice meeting you, fellas. Oh! That was swell! Lyon : Well, the camera loves you, sweetheart. You could make a fortune. Norma Jeane : I don't care about money. I just want to be wonderful. Lyon : (Chuckles) Well, that's a nice attitude. So here is the deal. 75 a week, to be paid whether we use you or not. Contract is renewable after six months at our option. So, just a couple of small items, then. Place of birth? Norma Jeane : Los Angeles... Lyon : Los Angeles... And maRital status? Norma Jeane : Well, separated. Lyon : All our starlets are single, sweetheart. Whether they're married or not. Oh. (Small chuckles) Lyon : And how about your, folks. What... what do they do? Well, I never knew them. I was raised in an orphanage. Lyon : Oh. I'm sorry kid. That's... that's rough. Norma Jeane : Well, it's where I learned to act, Mr. Lyon. Lyon : Ben. Norma Jeane : Oh. Ben. (Chuckles) So, "Norma Jeane Goe- dog-erty"? Norma Jeane : Dock-er-ty. Lyon : We need something people can pronounce. Norma Jeane : Well, my maiden name's Mortensen. Lyon : That's a little long. Grace : What about "Monroe"? It was her mother's name. Lyon : Love it.  You know, kid, you remind me of an actress  I used to know back on broadway: Marilyn Miller. Yeah. Marilyn Monroe? How about that? Huh? The alliteration's good. Marilyn : Um, okay. Lyon : (Clears his throat) Monroe... (Pen rasps) I liked it. Marilyn : No. Grace : It's all right. It'll be fine. Marilyn : Grace, please. (Low hum of chatter) Marilyn : Well, I've got a six-month contract at fox. And even if I don't work, they have to pay me. Gladys : You're such a pretty girl. Grace : And they changed her name. It's "Marilyn Monroe." She's using your maiden name. Gladys : Oh. (Small chuckle) She's very pretty. Marilyn : Well, I'm your daughter. I don't remember giving birth to you. Marilyn : I'm gonna go speak with the doctor. Gladys : Here. Look at these. Gladys : Oh. Grace : Aren't these wonderful, dear? Marilyn : Uh, why is she wearing that uniform? Dr. Ennis : Oh yeah, it makes her feel more in control. Miss Mortensen, is your father available to speak with us? We're hoping he could shed some light on her behavioral history. Marilyn I never met him. I don't know where he is. Dr. Ennis : Well... My Aunt Grace said that... Well, they were never married so... Dr. Ennis : Well, the shock treatment is working. Grace : Hm-hm. The head of casting said that she'd go straight to the top. Gladys : The top of what? Grace : The ladder, I don't know. (Small laugh) Here she is. Marilyn : They'd like to speak with my father. Do you... Do you know where he is? Gladys : No. Well, they think... If they could speak with him that it could help you. Could you help us find him? No. I don't know, but I'm sure he's very nice. Marilyn : Then I drove out to the desert to see him, but... Well, he wouldn't even come to the door. I'm not even sure he was the one. The one who is my father. Alan : Do you think finding him would've made a difference? I don't know if it was so much him as... It was the idea of him. Alan : Which do you think was stronger:  Wanting his approval, his protection, his love...  Or the idea of being able to say, "I did it without you?" Well, I suppose it was his approval and love... The other is petty. Alan : But it didn't happen so... You had to look for it elsewhere. Marilyn : You mean by the men I marry? (Big exhale) Alan : Is that the only time you tried to see Mr. GifFord? Marilyn : Yes. Well, I had a career to focus on. Pat : You can give me a lift, right? Sorry for interrupting. Whitey : I'm packing up, Marilyn. Marilyn : When will you be back? Whitey : It's only for two days. I'll be back monday. Marilyn : Oh. Pat... Pat : I'll be back monday, too. I hate to be alone. Pat : Listen. Mrs. Murray's here if you need anything... Marilyn : (Groans) Mrs. Murray... Marilyn was just telling me about her first studio contract.  It's fascinating. Whitey : I think you're in good hands, peaches. Pat : You call me if you need anything. Marilyn : (Big exhale) Please hold a good thought for me, Pat. Pat : Always. (They both chuckle) Pat : You be good. Thank you, doctor. Marilyn : I love you. (Receding footsteps, door opens then shuts) 
 
 (Cars rumble by, dog barks in the distance) Alan : So... your first contract... Marilyn : Hmm. Well, that's where I met Whitey. But I never got hired. Alan : Wait. You mean? Marilyn I never got hired. Mr. Zanuck... Well, the head of the production... He hated me. All I did was publicity stills. I couldn't even pay my rent. But I went to the studio every day. And I learned as much as I could about lighting, and wardrobe and makeup. Whitey : I'll see you on set for finals.  Hi. Marilyn : Oh, I was just watching. Whitey : No, come on in. Marilyn : Hi, I'm... I'm Marilyn Monroe. And I'm a contract player here. And I don't mean to be a bother, but... well, I'm not working right now, so I was hoping you could help me... Well, show me how I could apply my makeup better. Whitey : Of course, come on in, grab a seat. (Clears his throat) So, it's different for black and white and color photography. Let's start with the black and white look. Marilyn : Perfect. Whitey : You've got great structure. Marilyn : Oh. My eyes are too far apart. Whitey : The camera will never know. Your skin's a bit dry, though. Marilyn : I know. Whitey : Try using vaseline under the... Marilyn : I put vaseline under the base. Marilyn : Oh, at least I'm doing something right. Oh, I love Jean Harlow. Whitey : She's great. Marilyn : She's beautiful. Whitey : Okay. Let's get your makeup off first. ♪♪ (Admiring) Oh... (Sighs) Oh... It's perfect. Whitey : Yes, it is. (Small chuckle) (Door creaks open, lights click on and off) (Frustrated grunt, lights click on and off) (Door shuts, keys clink in a glass blow then thud to the floor) ♪♪ Marilyn : Hello Tom? Hi, it's Norma Jeane, well, actually uh, it's Marilyn Monroe now. The um, studio changed my name. How are you? Oh, good. Um, listen, I... I've been thinking and I've-i've reconsidered your offer. Yes. Uh, well, as long as your wife is present. Well, I think everything should-should be fine. (Jazz music plays, footsteps thud up the stairs) Mrs. Kelly : How are you doing, Norma Jeane? Marilyn : Oh, um, it's Marilyn now, please call me Marilyn. I have to get used to it. I've done my makeup so I'm ready to go. Mrs. Kelly : Well, you look beautiful. And don't be nervous. Marilyn : Thank you for being here. Mrs. Kelly : It's fine, honey. Can I get you something? A coffee? Marilyn : Oh, uh, yes, please. Mrs. Kelly : Okay. Tom : Norma Jeane, come.  It's Marilyn, remember? Tom : Uh-huh. Mrs. Kelly : How's that? Tom : Uh, it looks great. Perfect. Perfect. (Nervous exhale) Mrs. Kelly : Don't be nervous. You're beautiful. Thank you. Tom : Okay. The camera is your boyfriend, honey. Oh, yeah. And what a lucky boyfriend he is. Nice. Beautiful. Beautiful. All right. Stay just like that. (Shutter clicks) Perfect.  Okay, one more just like that. Just like that.  (Shutter clicks) Perfect.  All right, can we remove the fabric now? Mrs. Kelly : Are you ready? Marilyn : Sure. (Nervous exhale) Tom : You have the prettiest figure I think I've ever seen! (Small chuckle) My husband certainly enjoys his work. Marilyn : I should hope so. Mrs. Kelly : Oh, he does. (Both laugh) Tom : Okay, here we go. One, two, beautiful. (Shutter clicks)  Hm-hm.  Just like that. Very nice. (Shutter clicks) Perfect. Very nice. Lift your hand a bit to the left. There we go. You are killing me. Yes. And there we go.  And hold that. Beautiful. Oh my goodness. Okay. Thank you!  Here you go. Marilyn : Oh, thank you. This is going straight to the electric company, and to Ford Motors. This isn't gonna get around town is it? Tom : You'll be the queen of every gas station and barbershop in the midwest, but no one in hollywood will ever know, honey, don't worry. (Sighs with relief) Do you know joe Schenck? Marilyn : Um, is he the chairman of Fox Studios? Tom : Yeah. That's the one. Marilyn : I know who he is... Every week there's a poker party at his house. Producers, directors, big money. He likes pretty girls. You pour some drinks, you make small talk... Oh. I don't know, Tom. I don't really have a dress to wear to something like that. You can pick out whatever you like. Marilyn : Really? Tom : Really. Marilyn : Well... (Laughs) Really?! Tom : Really. Something like this? Beautiful. ♪♪ Here you go. Cab driver : Thanks. ♪♪ (Nervous exhale) (Music playing, low hum of party chatter) (Laughing) ♪♪♪♪ Marilyn : Good evening, Mr. Schenck. I hope I'm not too late. I can try to be punctual. Schenck : That's fine, my dear. You're here now. What's your name? Marilyn : Marilyn. Schenck : Marilyn. Marilyn : Yes. Schenck : That's lovely. Marilyn : Thank you. Schenck : Come meet the boys. Marilyn : I'd love to. Schenck : Gentlemen. This is Marilyn. Men : Hello. Hello. Ooh, hello. Marilyn : Hello gentlemen. Schenck : She's going to be joining us. Marilyn : Well... (Small laugh) Waiter : Champagne, Miss? Oh, please. Waiter : Champagne?  Well, what are we playing? Marilyn : (Shyly) No. (Polite chuckles) Schenck : Hey. You know who I am... Marilyn : But you don't know who I am. (Both chuckle playfully) Schenck : Honey, I probably know you better than you know yourself. Let's go. (Door creaks open) Schenck : Yeah, I think she's exactly what you're looking for. (Chuckles) Uh, Marilyn... Marilyn : (Whispers) Monroe. Schenck : Marilyn Monroe. Yeah. I'll have her call your office. Good. Picture's called "scudda-hoo! Scudda-hay!" Marilyn : What's it about? Schenck : It's a picture. Marilyn : Thank you, Mr. Schenck. Schenck : Yeah... You signed to a studio? Marilyn : I was. Yours. But I guess Mr. Zanuck didn't feel I- Schenck : Zanuck's a schmuck. I'll take care of it. Here. Marilyn : Giving me a chance is one thing. Giving me cash is another. (Kiss) Thank you. See you soon. Yeah. Alan : You were terrific in "Asphalt Jungle."  Oh... That was my big break. My last film was directed by Mr. Huston as well, but... Well, it was very difficult... Oh, come, Dr. DeShields, don't make me drink alone. Alan : I'm sorry. That would be a violation of the doctor/patient relationship. Marilyn : But we don't have doctor/patient relationship yet. (Giggles) Oh, don't be such a fuddy-duddy. Alan : Do you drink at work? Marilyn : Never. Alan : Did Dr. Greenson drink with you? Oh... Dr. Greenson sends me to Dr. Engelberg for my vitamin shots. And after my vitamin shots I can barely walk or talk. Alan : Marilyn, why did you call me? I just... I don't want to become my mother. Marilyn : Are you saying she's cured? Dr. Ennis : Paranoid Schizophrenia isn't the measles, Miss Mortensen. It's a permanent condition for which there is no cure. Marilyn : Well, if she's not better, then why are you releasing her? Dr. Ennis : Well, she hasn't posed a threat to herself, or other patients or the staff in six weeks. I can't keep her here any longer. Marilyn : But what if it happens again? Dr. Ennis : We'll be here. (Approaching footsteps) (Gate squeaks open) Marilyn : I'm taking you with me, mother. Gladys : (Hushed) Will I be safe? Dr. Ennis : Of course. Marilyn : Thank you. Ice cream man : You have a great day, ma'am. Ice cream, Miss? The ice cream man recognized me, so he gave it to us for free! Gladys : You should ask him if he'll give us lunch, too. (Small chuckle) (Waves lap) Marilyn : Do you remember when we used to come here, when I was little? Gladys : This is very good. Marilyn : Jimmie and I are divorced now. I thought that'd make you glad. Gladys : Did you love him? Marilyn : I don't know. It would be nice to be in love, though. Gladys : I hope that happens for you. Marilyn : How old were you when you started to hear the voices? Gladys : You're hearing them now, aren't you? Well, not all the time. Gladys : No, of course not. Marilyn : Well, did grandmother have them too? Is that why she had to go away? I couldn't take care of her any longer, and some day you won't be able to take care of me. Marilyn : Oh, I will always take care of you... and she blamed me. She called me an ingrate and said... Vile things about me. But, when it happens, when you have to send me away, and trust me, you will some day. I won't blame you. I won't blame you at all. Because it's the parent's job to take care of the child, not the other way around. Oh, I don't wanna make you sad. Marilyn : Oh no... Gladys : Look, you have a smile just like your grandmother, Della. (Small laugh) Hmm. Marilyn : So do you really think that man will buy us lunch? Gladys : I think he would, but he's gonna want something more from you, Norma Jeane. They always do. (Classical waltz plays) ♪♪ (Music ends, applause) Waiter : Champagne? Marilyn : Oh, please. Thank you. Schenck : To us. Marilyn : To us. (Glasses clink) Schenck : Now, there's some people I'd like you to meet. Starting with this man right here. Peter, this is Marilyn Monroe. Peter is a fantastic producer. Marilyn : Oh, well, it's nice to meet you, fantastic producer. Schenck : And over here, Robert, I'd like you to meet Marilyn Monroe. Robert is the richest man I know. (All chuckle) Marilyn : Hello. It's nice to meet you. Schenck : Ah yes, Alvin, I'd like you to meet Marilyn Monroe. Alvin is a damn fine director. Yeah. Marilyn : Oh. It's a pleasure. See how easy it is. Marilyn : Thank you. Oh! The water's so great. Come on in. Schenck : Ehh! I'd sink like a rock. (Chuckles) Marilyn : You never learned how to swim? Schenck : I came over on the boat when I was six. That was water enough. (Laughs) I'm glad you called me. I thought you were avoiding me. Marilyn : Oh, no. No, I... Well, just took some time off, you know. I've been to New York, and Acapulco... And I'm fixing up the most adorable little house in Santa Monica. Schenck : "New York, Acapulco". Marilyn : Yeah. Nothing happens in this town that I don't know about. And I know about you. You got no agent. You haven't worked. And you're living in a rat-trap. Correct or not? This-this hurts me, Marilyn. We're friends, I thought. (Sighs) I owe five months rent. (Groans) I'll take care of that. Why aren't you getting any jobs? Marilyn : I don't know... Maybe I don't have what it takes. Schenck : Oh, you got it. You just gotta believe it. I want you meet Natasha Lytess.  She's the best coach in the business.  Yeah. But... She would never work with me. Ah, pfft. (Chuckles) Oh, joe, you're so wonderful. I am uh... Well, I wish there was something I could do for you. (Chuckles) Come on! Ooh! Gladys : They're there, and they're going to get in! Grace : There's no one's out there. Gladys : We have to be careful, don't let them in, have to keep them out. Grace : Gladys, there is no one out there. Gladys : Of course they're there, I can see them! Grace : Really? Gladys : They're there, we have to keep them out! Grace : You need to calm down! Come on! Really. Marilyn : What's happening?! Get off me! She thinks there is some trying to get in. Gladys : I don't think it, I don't know there're people trying to get in. Grace : There's nobody trying to get in. Come on. Gladys : Get-get off of me. Grace : Stop! Stop! Gladys : Grace, you're gonna be sorry. You're gonna be sorry when they get in here. Marilyn : Okay. Mother, mother! Look, mother. Gladys : I'm telling you... they're coming! Look, mother. Mother. Everything is going to be all right now. All right? They can't come in if you're in charge. Okay, you're in charge. See? Gladys : It's mine, it's not yours. Marilyn : Yes. Oh. Here's your little hat. Do you want your little hat? Gladys : That's mine too. Marilyn : Okay. (Relieved exhale) (Bird chirp) (Car honks and rumbles by) (Latch clicks) (Bells jingle) Natasha : Do you always dress like that? Marilyn : No, not always. Natasha : This is 300-years of collective wisdom devoted to the art and craft of the theater. All of it can be summarized in a concept that is both simple and excruciating: Know yourself,  transmit that knowledge through the character to the audience.  Who we are will be found in the aggregate of our experience... not in our bosom. Well, I think I'm a nice person. I adore children. Natasha : Why? Marilyn : Their innocence, I guess. All they want is to be loved. Natasha : Is that all you want? To be loved? Well, not all. I want to be a movie star. Natasha : I do not make movie stars. I make actresses. What are you afraid of? Marilyn : Loneliness. I can see that you have known loneliness. Are you willing to draw upon that experience? Marilyn : Well, they weren't... They were not the happiest of times. Happy times do not always make great work. (Music playing, low hum of party chatter) Schenck : She'll work with you, right? Marilyn : We start tomorrow. I'm so excited. Schenck : Yeah, I bet she is, too. Did she try to get you into bed? Marilyn : What? Schenck : (Laughs) Marilyn : I would never do that. Schenck : Yeah. Well, don't let her know. And never say never. Drink? Marilyn : Thank you. Schenck : He's the reason we're here. Johnny Hyde. He's an agent with William Morris. His father was in the circus, so I guess he comes by it naturally. He's Lana Turner, Rita Haywoth, and Betty Hutton.  Go ahead.  Oh... Oh, come with me. I hate introducing myself. Schenck : He knows who you are. Marilyn : He does? Schenck : Hm-hm. ♪♪♪♪ Hyde : You're already a star, I know, except the right people, these people, don't know it. I'll make sure they find out. Inside six months you'll never have to read again. Offers only. (Exhales) I admire men who don't waste time. Hyde : You like to keep your Johnny waiting?! Marilyn and I get to work with Bette Davis and Anne Baxter! It's called "all about eve". Gladys : I won't be here. Marilyn : Oh mother, you know I start shooting next week. Gladys : I'm gonna visit your Miss Dora in Oregon. Marilyn : Oh... Well, oregon's such a long trip, mother. Gladys : I enjoy traveling. You meet so many interesting people. Marilyn : When will you be back? Gladys : Oh, don't worry, dear, you'll be fine. You'll have to get used to my not being here at some point. Marilyn : Oh, yes. Gladys : Oh, Norma Jeane... Marilyn : Yes, mother. Gladys : You won't tell anyone where I'm going? Marilyn : Your secret's safe with me. Gladys : Good girl. (Door click open then shuts) (Sighs) (Dog barks in the distance) Natasha : This is scene 73, Marilyn... You've just become ill in the ladies' room of the theater. Marilyn : I know, I know... Natasha : Work through your process. Connect with the character. Good. I shall read the role of Mr. Dewitt. (Calming exhale) Natasha : "Ah, feeling better, my dear?" Marilyn : "Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?" Natasha : "Your next move, it seems to me, should be towards television." Marilyn : "Tell me this: Do they always..." Natasha : "Do they have auditions for television?" Marilyn... Marilyn : Do you hear that? Natasha : Concentrate. Marilyn : No! They're talking about me! Natasha : There's no one out there. Marilyn : You don't hear that? Natasha : No, there's nothing. Marilyn : Oh, I can't do this when they're out there. Turn out the lights... Turn them out! (Panicked breathing) I have to call Johnny... Natasha : Come here, come here. Come here... I will take care of you. Oh, darling girl. Why are you so tormented? (Hushed) I'm not mother. (Heavy breathing) George Sanders : Ah, feeling better, my dear? Marilyn : Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what? George Sanders : For your next move, it seem to me, you should head towards television. Marilyn : Tell me this: Do they have auditions for television? Mankiewicz : Cut. Marilyn : How was I that time? Mankiewicz : Claudia is not a girl who thinks a great deal. She's instinctive. I'm telling you again: Throw the line away. Don't invest too much into it. Am I clear? Marilyn : Certainly, Mr. Mankiewicz. Mankiewicz : Hmm. Camera reload, please. Marilyn : Thank you. Natasha : The line needs more pathos. Marilyn : He wants me to throw it away. Natasha : But this is your moment. Marilyn : But he wrote the script. Johnny! Hyde : How's my girl? Marilyn : I'm good. How are you? Hyde : You're doing great. Marilyn : Oh, for me. Oh, it's about my mother. She left for oregon two weeks ago and she never got there. Hyde : I thought your mother is dead. Marilyn : She gets so confused! She could be lost... Hyde : But you told me she's dead. Marilyn : Well, the publicity people they... They thought it would make a better story if I was an orphan. Johnny, I really need to find her. Can you help me, please. I can't go back out there. Hyde : You gotta go. Marilyn : No, please, just tell them. I can't do it! Hyde : You gotta. They're all waiting for you. Here... These'll calm you down. They work good. Everyone swears by them. Marilyn : No, I don't take medicine. Hyde : What do you mean you don't take medicine? Take the medicine... you need it. I'll find your mother. (Kiss) Take them. (Sighs) Marilyn : Natasha, don't worry. Oh! St... Johnny! Johnny, I need her! Hyde : She's gonna ruin you! Mankiewicz is the director, not you! This town is full of failed actresses who think they can teach! Now tell her. Marilyn : Johnny, please- Hyde : Tell her! I worked like a dog to get you the job! Marilyn : You got me the audition. I got the job! They agreed to let you stay on set. But we can't talk. But just give me a look and I'll know what you want. Hyde : You want this whole thing to go to hell?! Marilyn : It'll be all right. Oh, I love you, too. (Slams phone) Oh! How could you do that to her? Hyde : I'm trying to protect you from her! She thinks you're nuts! She told me you hear voices! She's using you, honey. Marilyn : Everyone uses everyone. Marilyn : (Uneasy breathing) No. I'm not... Not... true...  I'm not... (Shudders, exhales) I'm not. (Exhales) (Bottle clinks, pills rattle) (Exhales) (Breathing hard) Grace : Can you believe this fan mail?  Of course I can. That's what happens! Grace : All of these. They want pictures with autographs! Every single one. I'll get you one of those stamps. Marilyn : No. I wanna sign each one myself. And put a personal message! (Tired exhale) You know that darling little apartment I was telling you about ... that I'm moving to on doheny. Well, it has two bedrooms! Grace : Baby, I'm so happy for you. Marilyn : You can come stay with me whenever you want. (Tired breathing) (Phone ringing) Marilyn : Hello. Gladys : I know you're looking for me! You have no right sending spies! Marilyn : Where are you? Gladys : Are you never gonna forgive me? It broke my heart to give you up. It was my mother that insisted. So how much longer are you gonna hold this against me?! Marilyn : Mother, just tell me where you are. No, I don't have to. I'm a married woman now, I can do whatever I want! Marilyn : You're married? That's wonderful. Gladys : Yes. He's a lovely man. John Herbert Eley. I call him John. Well, can I meet him? Gladys : Oh, you're not going to trick me into coming back there! No. I have advisers, and they have told me that I should not return to California under any circumstances. That I would be in grave danger if I do. You're being watched, too. What do you mean? Who's watching? (Hangs up the phone) (Door clicks open) Marilyn : Johnny. (Camera shutter clicks) Hyde : Your mother's new husband is John Stewart Eley. Marilyn : She said it was John Herbert... Hyde : And my P.I. says there were people in some gin mill, and he was bragging to them that he "landed Marilyn Monroe's old lady". And on top of it, this Eley character's a bigamist. He's got another wife in idaho. Can you fellas please give some privacy? Whitey : Yeah, sure thing. Hyde : Honey, I know you don't wanna hear it, but everything's breaking good for you, and let's face facts. Some people you just can't help. So you want me to forget her?  What kind of person would do that?  And what kind of person would suggest that?  Hyde : I'm thinking of you, honey.  Oh, are you?! No one can tell me what to do about my mother. She's my responsibility! Hyde : I'm sorry, Marilyn. Whatever you decide, I'm with you. I talked to my lawyer. The divorce'll be final end of the month. Marilyn : I can't marry you, Johnny. I'm sorry. Hyde : I left my family. Marilyn : I didn't ask you to. And I didn't want you to. Hyde : You said you love me. Marilyn : Well, I do, but... Well, I mean, if we got married it'd be for all the wrong reasons. Marilyn : I didn't want to be a gold-digger. I couldn't. Johnny was the kindest man I ever. (Sniffles) Nobody had ever loved me like that. And then he died. (Diamonds are a girl's best friend" by Marilyn Monroe) ♪ Time rolls on and youth is gone ♪
