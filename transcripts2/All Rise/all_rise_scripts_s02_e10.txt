 Penal Code    , robbery of Daines Jewelers. 
 Ms. Lopez. 
 Your Honor, I am not announcing ready for trial. 
 [SIGHS] 
 As I have repeatedly informed the court and counsel, my investigator is actively working to locate an exculpatory witness. 
 For that reason, I am renewing my motion to continue. 
 The defense has been searching    for this witness for three months. 
 Yes, because the witness can explain what Mr. Wu was doing in that area at the time of his arrest. 
 The defense is no closer to producing...

 - And I have a winning lottery ticket.

 - Your Honor, the People have a right to a speedy trial, too.

 - but also emotionally. 
 - I'm sorry, Ms. Lopez. 
 I agree with the People that the defense has had sufficient time to investigate this case. 
 I am deeming you ready for trial.

 No, it's not too late to ask for a plea deal. 
 No. 
 I didn't take those necklaces. 
 I was helping a woman with a flat... 
 Three blocks from the store where the robbery took place. 
 There are only so many coincidences that I can argue away in this case. 
 The prosecution has two eyewitnesses who identify you as being the suspect, and we don't have any witnesses who can explain why you were in the area. 
 Do we have a chance? 
 As long as we have the truth on our side, John, there is always a chance. 
 You didn't match the description of the suspect anyway. 
 You weren't wearing a baseball cap or a jacket when they stopped you, and you didn't have the necklaces in your possession even though the robbery happened    minutes before, so really, the burden here is on the prosecution to prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
 All we need is doubt. 
 But if you can't find our witness, how do you create doubt? 
 I point out the problems with the evidence and then present our eyewitness identification expert, and hopefully, that'll be enough to... 
 To create some doubt in Judge Benner's mind.

 Learned stereotypes that are spontaneous, unexpected, and profoundly deep-rooted in our belief system.

 How many of you think you may have an unconscious bias or two?

 Unconscious bias is as common among judges as everyone else. 
 Mm. 
 I see your skepticism. 
 Okay, let me ask you another question. 
 If you were to have car trouble, how many of you would be relieved to have a man stop to help you rather than a woman?

 I just want this whole nightmare to be over. 
 I understand. 
 I'm gonna try and make this as easy on you as I can. 
 DELGADO: Well, justice isn't blind. 
 It's obvious that implicit bias exists. 
 Well, how do we fix the problem if we're not aware we have it? 
 By what you're doing right now. 
 This is great, but you also need to commit to ongoing learning. 
 Open yourselves up to greater exposure to people who are different than you. 
 Be fair. 
 I've been a judge for    years. 
 I've done my best to be fair. 
 Research shows your best isn't good enough. 
 We're learning that the brain often acts contrary to our conscious beliefs, that unconscious biases influence the way we interpret the behavior of the defendants. 
 Professor Jennings, respectfully, we're not psychologists. 
 We're judges. 
 Our job is to interpret the law. 
 The law was constructed at a time when we didn't have a clue about the brain. 
 Blind reliance on precedent makes as much sense as someone operating on you using the tools and techniques from     . 
 Yes, but almost all criminals who commit violent crimes have prior convictions.

 Because I remember a distinctive mark above his right eyebrow. 
 No further questions, Your Honor.

 There is no way     she could've noticed the birthmark.

 Yes, that's from our store camera. 
 So this is an accurate depiction of how the suspect looked

 - Yes. 
 And just to be clear, the suspect is wearing a baseball cap and a mask over his face, correct? 
 - Yes. 
 - But it's your testimony that you could see the suspect's face clearly enough to be certain of who he was? 
 Yes, I-I could see his eyes, eyebrows and a part of his nose. 
 A part. 
 Hmm. 
 Had you seen the suspect before? 
 - No. 
 - Maybe at the coffee shop next door or in the neighborhood. 
 No.

 I'm the judge, so, yes, I am. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 Well, look, if he wasn't the man who robbed me, then why would the police bring him over for me to identify? 
 So you only recognized my client after the police brought him to your store, correct? 
 Ms. Daines? 
 Are you all right? 
 I just don't understand why everyone's attacking me. 
 - I am the victim here. 
 - No one is attacking you. 
 We are just trying to get to the truth. 
 And I am trying to tell you the truth, but apparently you don't want...

 Usually it's Carmichael in my ear. 
 I just can't stop questioning everything. 
 Well, if anything comes of these seminars and our one-on-one conversations, it's that we get judges to take their time. 
 That's a tough one. 
 I have a backlog of cases. 
 Yeah, sometimes it just feels like my courtroom has turned into a conveyor belt.

 What do you do to relieve stress? 
 Yoga. 
 Oh, I watch old movies when I can. 
 Read when I can. 
 Um... 
 I don't have a lot of spare time. 
 Hmm. 
 Then let's get started, and hopefully, our conversation will help you sort things out. 
 Yes, okay. 
 Take for instance, a victim I have who remembers a birthmark on a suspect, even though it's questionable she saw it on the day of the robbery. 
 Well, maybe she saw the suspect at another time and doesn't remember. 
 It's not surprising. 
 Research shows our memories are fallible.

 It was before I was born. 
 They used to have a knack for ripping off stores quickly. 
 Vic would go, and he'd case the joint, locate the most expensive items. 
 The next day, Richie would go in, know exactly where to go, in and out before the police...

 It was Christmas Eve. 
 We were so busy. 
 It was all just a blur. 
 This is three days before the robbery. 
 The man's John Wu. 
 You spoke to him? 
 Do you remember what he said, which piece of jewelry he wanted to see, anything about that day? 
 No, sorry. 
 What does this mean? 
 That Mr. Wu may have been casing your store. 
 No, it only proves that John Wu was in the store. 
 Your Honor, it proves that her client lied not once but twice when he told the police he had never been in the store. 
 It also proves your witness lied. 
 She was adamant... 
 Adamant that the first time she ever saw John was December   th. 
 Your Honor, I think this is valuable evidence, and even though it's late, it should be admitted at trial. 
 - I'll allow it. 
 - Your Honor, please... 
 I'll see you in court, Ms. Lopez. 
 I thought we were passing. 
 Because he's a friend of Vic's? 
 You're willing to throw away $   , because Richard has a past with Vic? 
 No, sorry.

 I don't want to be any more entangled in you and Mark's personal life than I already am.

 And this... 
 This is much too much. 
 Mark calls him "Uncle Richie." He may not be his uncle, but he's still family. 
 - It's not ethical. 
 - What?! 
 I don't wanna be any more involved. 
 Well, that's gonna be a little difficult, seeing as that you're one of Mark's closest friends, which is why I was hoping I could talk to you about Mark.

 - Well... 
 - So what are you feeling? 
 That I may have acted too hastily when I deemed Ms. 
 Lopez ready for trial. 
 Everything was happening so quickly. 
 Hey, then slow it down. 
 Justice should never take a backseat to efficiency. 
 You saw the video, and... 
 It only proves that he was in the store. 
 I looked over the video from the day of the robbery. 
 Yes, the two men are the same height. 
 It's... 
 It's hard to tell about weight because of the jacket he's wearing. 
 I mean, can two eyewitnesses be wrong? 
 Cross-racial identification. 
 Our minds are shaped by racial disparities we see every day. 
 Bias can not only control what we see, but where we look. 
 Eyewitness testimony is a crucial part of the criminal justice system. 
 It has been a prominent and compelling form of evidence in our courtrooms for hundreds of years,     and now I'm not supposed to trust... 
 According to the Innocence Project, "mistaken eyewitness identification contributed to approximately   %     of more than wrongful convictions. 
 Yeah.

 I asked you repeatedly.

 If Judge Benner hears your side of the story, then... 
 I'll do whatever you want me to. 
 No more lies. 
 I mean it, John. 
 Okay. 
 Tell me what happened. 
 I was getting back in my truck when a police car pulled up. 
 They asked me what I was doing there Where was the woman you helped with the flat tire? 
 - She had already left. 
 - What happened next? 
 The police put me in the backseat of the car, then drove me to the jewelry store. 
 Did they tell you why they wanted you to come with them? 
 I fit a description of a suspect. 
 I told them I was a groundskeeper at the country club and didn't know anything about any robbery. 
 Do you still work at the club? 
 No, they fired me after they learned I had been arrested. 
 I've got a wife, two kids. 
 I didn't do anything wrong. 
 Mr. Wu, have you ever been in Daines Jewelers? 
 - Yes, on Christmas Eve. 
 - And what made you go in? 
 I was on my way home. 
 I got a bonus. 
 My wife's always wanted diamond earrings, thought I'd surprise her for Christmas. 
 But why Daines Jewelers? 
 There are several stores in the neighborhood. 
 They were having a sale. 
 In    years, I'd never seen a "Sale" sign. 
 Did you buy anything? 
 No, the store owner was rude, said she could tell just by looking at me, I didn't have enough money for anything, even on sale. 
 - Objection. 
 - Overruled. 
 Mr. 
 Wu, why did you lie and tell the police     
 - you had never been in the store? 
 - I was afraid. 
 I've worked hard my whole life, tried to do the right thing. 
 But none of that mattered to the police. 
 I fit the description, so I was guilty. 
 Mr. Wu, were you in Daines Jewelers     
 - on December   th? 
 - No. 
 No further questions, Your Honor. 
 Mr. Callan, your witness. 
 Mr. Wu, you testified to the police that you lied      
 - when you were taken into custody. 
 - Yes, I was afraid. 
 And you're afraid now there's gonna be consequences     
 - to this trial, aren't you?

 minutes.

 Frankly, the court doesn't know what to believe. 
 We are not certain Mr. Wu is innocent, but we are also not satisfied that the People have proved that Mr. Wu committed the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
