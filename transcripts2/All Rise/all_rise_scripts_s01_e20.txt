 Previously on "All Rise"... 
 Have you met my son Ben? Your name is Ben Benner. 
 You have been on two dates. 
 Both of which, I will remind you, went spectacularly well. 
 I kind of want to have lunch with Detective Harris. 
 What?You can order another one. 
 It was just one martini. 
 Okay, it was two, but I thought it was vodka, not gin. 
 Gin makes me loopy. 
 Daphne, did you dowhat you're accused of? 
 No, I wasn't even in the house. 
 You and I should go for a ride.Oh, I got work to do. 
 No, no, no. I put on the uniform. 
 I'll get a patrol car. You can see for yourself what we're doing out there. 
 Isn't this is the firstdomestic violence trial you've had after After my abusive marriage to Joe? 
 Emily's worse for the wear,but I did not see that coming. 
 You can only bury pain like that for so long before it just... 
 Breaks you. 
 He got in my face, and that's when I swung at him. 
 So you lied to the police, right?Objection. Argumentative. 
 Overruled. Witness may answer.- Yes, but Objection, our Honor.- What else are you lying about? 
 Counsel, that's enough! 
 Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay? 
 You okay? 
 Where you flying to,Maverick? 
 Shouldn't you be a mile out by now? 
 Cute. I thought ride-alongswere for new D.A.s. 
 Weber was persistent. 
 Oh, he likes you. 
 I remember the first time I went out on one of these, and it hit me being part of this huge effort to help people. 
 Is that why D.A.s alwaysbelieve law enforcement? 
 Uh, police are trained observers with experience testifying. 
 And incentive to hide mistakesand protect their careers. 
 Why do you believe your clients?You calling me gullible? 
 Are you calling me credulous? 
 That's the same You're using my words. 
 Go. I don't want the detective to see me consorting with the defense. 
 You should be so lucky.Ah. 
 Detective. 
 Girlfriend? 
 Never seen her beforein my life. 
 Good morning. Good morning. 
 Whoa! Hey. Good look on you. 
 Shut up. Good morning.There's coffee in the thing. 
 Oh, no time. Breakfast with Mother Judge, and I'm already late. Dude, it's 7 a.m. 
 Tell me about it. My entire life. 
 Hey. Wait, wait, wait. Not so fast, Mister. 
 Mwah. Have a good day. 
 You, too. 
 Uh, "Mother Judge"? 
 Oh, I know.He's so freaking adorable. 
 Oh, shoot. I'm sorry. 
 It's fine. He's dead to the world. 
 He was up studying till 4:30 a.m. for the bar exam. 
 Why is my mom calling? 
 Mom, it's 7 a.m. What's wrong? 
 Hello? Who's this? 
 Who's this? Mom? 
 Sara? Is that you? 
 Judge Benner? 
 Oh, my God. You switched phoneswith Ben Benner. 
 It is not funny. She doesn't know about us. 
 She does now! Oh. Ben! 
 Ben! 
 "Step 7 Simplification unclutters the mind." 
 What time is it?Good morning, sunshine. 
 You're moving out? 
 Simplifying step 7. 
 What?Don't get me wrong.I love the steps. 
 All 21 of them.21, mm-hmm. 
 But would it hurt to tryactual therapy with an actual doctor? 
 This is actual therapy right here. 
 This is me, working through all of it, all my stuff. 
 You know, I'm I'm helping myself. 
 And I couldn't do it without you, pumpkin. 
 Come here. 
 Mmm. 
 You smell like... 
 Fritos and desperation. 
 Go shower.Yes. 
 Go on. 
 I don't need all this. 
 Didn't expect the uniform,Detective. 
 Giving you the patrol experience. 
 Try Romanian deadlifts. 
 Why? Sitting at a desk will kill you. 
 I work out. 
 A wobble board at your standing desk doesn't count. 
 No. I just bench pressyour shoddy paperwork. 
 Would it kill you guys to actually intervieweyewitnesses?Why bother? 
 Your team just pleads down to a slap on the wrist. 
 If we had the evidence,we wouldn't have to. 
 Right. 
 You ready to see some real policemen? 
 Hey! Arturo! 
 Where you been at? 
 Callan, under the seat grab that. 
 What's he doing, man? 
 How's your kid brother? 
 Better. Flu was brutal this year. 
 Nice uniform. Get demoted? 
 Oh, that's funny. Who's the suit? 
 Mark Callan.I'm with the D.A.'s office. 
 Arturo. 
 It's a quiet morning. 
 Yeah, the streetlight by the park is out again. 
 You nudge the city? Sure. 
 Hey, counselor, does Three Strike Reform darken your day?You studying law? 
 Gotta know the power to fight the power, right? 
 Your kid brother might like these. 
 "Hawkman." Classic. 
 I'm more ofa Dark Knight guy. 
 Nah, son. 
 Check that out right there. 
 That's tight. 
 Dad, Robin tried gettingback here. 
 Maybe I shouldthink about D.C. 
 You're only saying that so someone can tell you how foolish it is. 
 I want my marriage to work. 
 I just can't figure out another way. 
 You feel stuck? No. 
 I just keep forgetting why we thought it was a good Daddy, I brought doughnuts.- They won't fit under the door. 
 Roxy won't leave the bedroom. 
 Why didn't you lead with that? 
 You needed to talk. 
 She had second thoughtsabout resigning, but the leadershipat the nonprofit doesn't want her back. 
 She claims she's old. Oh, God. 
 Mom. 
 I'm on a personal retreat! 
 You're on something. 
 You are being ridiculous. 
 I don't want to talk! She's not talking to me. 
 You need to find outwhat's wrong. 
 Stop feeding her. She'll come out. 
 Lola Carmichael. I'm sorry, Daddy. 
 Uh, but I I I gotta get to work. 
 Check in as soon as you can. Mm-hmm. 
 I'm still not coming out. 
 How longhave you known Arturo? 
 It's been a minute. 
 I, uh, appreciateyour style. 
 Still think we're slackers?I didn't sayyou were slackers. 
 You implied. 
 Y'all think y'all smarter than us. 
 Our jobs are to recognize patterns. 
 What kind of patternsare you talking about? 
 Every year, you'll care more about the criminals and less about the folks trying to stop it. 
 Man! Ha ha ha! 
 Watch it! Get out of the road! 
 Are you okay?Yeah, I'm okay. 
 Back it up. 
 Sir, do you need assistance? Leave me alone. 
 Get back in the car. Get back in the car! 
 Sir, I'm hereto help you out, okay? 
 No, don't. Sir, just calm down, okay? 
 I'm here to help you. Relax. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Stop resisting. Let me go! 
 Stop resisting, or I'm gonna zap you. 
 What are you doing? What are you doing?! 
 Yo Stop resisting. 
 Ah. 
 We need someone right down here. 
 Max, behind you. 
 Ahh...Coming through. 
 Is he gonna be all right? 
 The guy was out of his mind. 
 When he went for my gun, I had to end it. 
 I'll be taking your statement. 
 Of course, yeah. Relax, Callan. 
 Now you got a good story for the office. 
 Tell me what you saw. 
 Still tryingto make sense of it. 
 It appearedthat the man... 
 Kavon Finch. Did you see him go for the detective's gun? 
 I saw a struggle, and Mr. Finchwas taken to the ground. 
 That's not what I asked. 
 Uh... 
 Dad, is Mom talking yet? 
 She's not even complaining about my cooking. 
 Ooh. That isbad. 
 Tells me everything. Not talking that's... 
 All right, Daddy. 
 I'll seen whenI can get away, okay? 
 All right. 
 Emily, what is that? What are you drinking? 
 Kombucha smoothie full of gut bacteria. 
 That is disgusting. Do you know what's in that? 
 You're drinking fungus. Get that away from me. 
 What is your next case again? 
 People v. Woodley. Right. That file's a loser. 
 You'll be done in an hour. Seven new files on your desk.Daphne? 
 What?Uh, nothing. My clientwill be pleading out. 
 Daphne, what are you doing here? 
 How you doing, Jordan?Everything okay? 
 Well, I'm being tried for murder, so... 
 I have good news. 
 The prosecutor's made an offerjust as we hoped. 
 She is going to reducethe charge to voluntary manslaughter.11 years in state prison. 
 Okay. 
 Which means,instead of 25 to life, you will be outin just over nine. 
 It is an excellent deal. 
 Yeah. 
 Last time we spoke,you were pretty upset. 
 You maybe weren'tabsorbing all that much, so so let's go through all this again, okay? 
 The evidence against youis strong. 
 You confessed to the policethat in the course of robbing the delivery truck and taping upthe driver's mouth, you blocked both of his airways, resulting in his death. Yeah. 
 You also have prior convictionsfor theft and assault. 
 Yeah, you wouldn't think that looking at me, would you? 
 But in prison, you learn how to fight. 
 You have no alibi, and most problematicof all, your DNA was found underneaththe victim's fingernail. 
 Now, that is a slam-dunkfor the prosecution, Jordan. 
 I can't beat it.My advice is to accept the deal that's being offered. 
 All right. 
 Do you have any questions? Yeah. Did he have any kids? 
 The driver did he have any children? 
 No, Jordan. He was 21.He was a kid himself. 
 He was 21? 
 Yeah.You don't remember that? 
 You don't remember that he was... that he was young? 
 I don't remember anything about that night. 
 Jordan, you gave a fullconfession to the police, and now you're changing your story? I know. 
 You admitted to boththe robbery and the killing. 
 I know I did, but yeah, I know. 
 I know this is hard. it's scary,and it's getting real now. 
 And you're wonderingif maybe you should risk going to trial,but like I said It's good. I'm good. I'm on board with the deal. 
 Can we just do this? 
 Do we have to keep talking about it? 
 My dad is literally slidingfood to her under the door. 
 Flat food. Depression? 
 That's just it. She's never had depression. 
 She's turning 64 next week.Maybe that's it? 
 I don't know.I've never known. 
 My dad's the Roxy whisperer. 
 The man has the patience of a saint. 
 Move. 
 Daphne Rivas?What's she doing here? 
 She's with Googan. Googan's a P.D. 
 I can't believe it.She reoffended? 
 You need to goto the P.D. office. 
 Find out Your Honor... 
 Find out why she's here. 
 All rise. 
 Department 61 of the Los Angeles Superior Court is now in session. 
 Judge Lola Carmichael presiding. 
 Let's make this quick. I have 34 other files, and my desk is about to collapse. Lopez? 
 You know what's bothering meabout Jordan's confession? 
 Are you serious? 
 She doesn't offer a singlepiece of new information. 
 Everything she tellsthe cops, if you flip back,they told her first. 
 What are you doing, Lopez? I thought you wanted to plea. 
 Thank you, Counsel. 
 Submit your findings at your earliest opportunity. 
 Moving on. People vs. Jordan Woodley. 
 I feel nauseous. 
 Jordan, were youtelling the truth before? 
 Do you really not remember what happened? 
 You know what? It's fine. 
 Like you said, it's a great deal. Great. 
 Counsel, I understand we have come to terms. 
 Uh, yes, Your Honor. 
 If the defendant willplead guilty or no contest to an amended count 2 of voluntary manslaughter... 
 In your confession, all you did was confirm what the policetold you had happened. 
 Because I probably did it. 
 You probably did it. 
 11 years in state prison. 
 Ms. Woodley, you've been informed of the terms of the deal? Yes, Your Honor. 
 You understandthat by pleading guilty, you will be forgoingyour opportunity for trial? 
 Sorry, Your Honor. Sorry. If we could just... 
 Can we stop? 
 Respectfully, Your Honor, if I can have a little more time to discuss this matter with my client.Oh, come on. 
 One day, Your Honor. It's a big decision. 
 Just...back tomorrow? 
 Jordan, I'm your lawyer.You have to trust me. 
 We are not accepting that dealunless you tell me exactly what you do rememberabout that night. 
 I... bought a bottle of rye at Jason's on 9th Street. 
 It was maybe 5, 6 p.m.? 
 And then I woke up in MacArthur Park. 
 When? I don't know. 
 It was late. It was dark. I don't know. 
 And nothing in between?Nothing? 
 No delivery truck,no driver, no murder? 
 Look, I'm an alcoholic. 
 I have blackouts, which doesn't mean that I pass out. 
 It means that I do things that I don't remember crazy stuff, like I steal things, stuff. 
 Whatever, like purses, phones. 
 I get in fights. 
 I wake up in jailwith cuts and bruises. 
 One time a broken ankle. 
 Half my life is made up of lost hours, and the other half is me trying to figure out what the hell I did, who I have to beg forgiveness. 
 They found my DNAon his body, Ms. Lopez. 
 That poor kid. 
 He died. 
 I mean, I could've done it. 
 I wouldn't be surprised if I had, but honestly, I-I have no idea. 
 I wish you'd told me thisbefore. 
 Do you have anyone? 
 Any friends or familythat I can call and and let them knowhow you're doing? 
 You're more worried about the essay or the Multistate? 
 I can talk my way out of anything, so the Multistate? 
 The essays are brutal. 
 Hey. What happened? You all right? 
 Yeah, uh Callan. 
 Welcome back. 
 The D.A. wants Peter Diaz on the prosecution of Kavon Finch. 
 Hard gang unit?That seems like overkill. 
 Diaz works in another office and doesn't really like you, so no conflict of interest. 
 Diaz doesn't like me? With you involved, we need to keep it as clean as possible. 
 Kavon assaulted a police officer. 
 What? 
 Assault?He's looking at five years. 
 What aboutmisdemeanor battery? 
 He tried to take an officer's weapon with the DDA watching. 
 Leniency is not in the cards. 
 You guys are moving fast. 
 Follow up with Diaz and have fun. 
 You're a witness now. 
 She's turning 64. Which is young. 
 Which is young.I thought she wanted a break. 
 Roxy finds energy and purpose. 
 She's gonna work herselfto death if we don'tkill each other first. 
 Lola. 
 Let's talk about you.How are you? 
 You're gonna be a witness.Shoe on the other foot. 
 Ball in the other court. 
 That's not a thing. Eh. 
 Detective Weber claims Kavon went for his gun. 
 That's not what you saw? 
 No, I don't... 
 Kavon lurched, and a second later, he's injured and facing a felony. 
 But if you say Kavon shouldn'tbe charged with assault... 
 Then I leave Weber vulnerable to charges of excessive force. 
 You think Weber is lying? 
 He doesn't seem like the type. 
 Every time I follow my instincts, I end up fighting my own team. 
 What am I doing wrong here? 
 Might be a sign you'redoing something right. 
 If you're worried about Roxy, take the day. 
 You're a judge. You can. 
 Mm-mm! And run the riskof her taking it out on me? 
 No, thank you. 
 Weber has his version of events. 
 Tell yours. Trust the systemto sort it out. 
 ...mushrooms for the Bolognese sauce. 
 That's right. Some people also use a mille fois... 
 Now let the flavors blend. 
 That is true. Since we have a lot of veggies already in the quote, unquote pasta, we could skip that step, but I have... 
 Ohh! 
 Sorry. 
 Good God. 
 Should've had that fixedwhen you were a teenager. 
 You knew? 
 I know all your tricks. 
 So are you going to tell mewhat's wrong? 
 Oh, so you gonna chase my problems to avoid your own?That's not true. 
 Is it Robin? 
 Actually,I'm worried about you. 
 I tried to go back to work at the nonprofit, teach a workshop. 
 And the new director told me, "Keep enjoying your rest." 
 Daddy said they weretrying to push you out. 
 Well, it's a young person's game now. 
 It is ridiculous. 
 Mom, you still have a lotthat you could teach them. 
 Yeah, I used to knock on doors, and now they're doing the tap, tap on FaceChat, and a thousand people show up. 
 Snapchat? I know what it is. 
 All those years, and when you are doing that work, when you are down in it, you justify every sacrifice. 
 But in the end You're not at the end. 
 Listen, what you and Robin are giving up, be sure it's worth it. 
 It is unbelievably awkward every time I run into your mother, which is all the time. 
 She is just down the hall. Why haven't you told her yet? 
 I know. I... 
 What, are you, like, embarrassed or something? 
 No, of course not, no.I just My... 
 My mother historically can bea little overprotective. 
 What does that mean? 
 We'll tell her tonight, okay?Together. 
 Oh, no, she is your mother. You tell her. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 I promise. Tonight.I'll text you, okay? 
 He tell her yet? 
 Tonight. He said his mother's overprotective? 
 That's worrisome. Tell me about it. 
 Ah, celery juice. Step 8. Mm. Ew. 
 Hey, did you catch that lookCarmichael gave me yesterday? 
 What, in 802?She knows what happenedin Benner's courtroom in thatdomestic violence case. 
 I mean, judges talk.She totally knows, but I just I feel like she's waitingfor me to fall apart again. 
 Well, she's just worried about you. We all are. 
 Not worried, concerned. 
 She's rooting for you. 
 Carol, hold the door. Sure, yeah. 
 I'm fine. All right. 
 Talk to you later. 
 Hey. 
 Okay, so Jordan Woodley is a blackout drunk. 
 She does crazy stuff that she cannot remember. 
 So maybe she killedthe guy. 
 Maybe, but but maybe not, Carol. 
 The confession is bogus. 
 The cops fed it to her, every detail. 
 Really?Yes. I can tear it down on cross. 
 I can explain away her priors by talking about her blackouts and the crazy, reckless behavior. 
 And then, if I can undermine the DNA, I have got a shot at reasonable doubt. 
 Well, then you gottago for it. 
 That's what I'm saying. Talk to Jimmy Slimms. 
 Jimmy Slimms. I'm going there right now. 
 Tell him howdy. Howdy. 
 And let me knowif you need any help. 
 I will. Yep. Nope. 
 Yes. 
 Hold on. Start over. 
 You got this. 
 Luke, can I get your eyes on this? 
 Uh, one sec. Larceny? Taking and carrying away. 
 What are you doing? Personal property. 
 With intent to deprive. Boom! 
 Callan, you remember Peter Diaz. 
 You haven't returnedmy calls. 
 I can't prosecute Kavon without my star witness. 
 Been very busy. 
 Uh-huh. Well, now looks like a good time. 
 Aren't we late for that, uh, conference? 
 They expected you on the... Sixth floor. 
 Second...fourth floor at, like, 10 minutes ago. 
 Sorry, Peter. I have to We will reschedule. Soon. 
 Uh, come on. Let's go talk. 
 Sure. That kid. 
 You shouldn't bereviewing this. 
 Another minute. 
 Is that a lurchor a lunge? 
 This could alter your memory, and it feels sketchy. 
 "Feels sketchy"isn't on the bar. 
 No rules broken. 
 Calm down, okay? I'm here to help you. Relax. 
 Did he go for the gun? 
 I can't tell. 
 I know firsthand that cops make mistakes, if that's what you're asking. 
 I wantedyour unique perspective. 
 It's not what you want to hear, but if I saw that coming at me,my training would kick in. 
 Are you sure? I mean... 
 Look at this.From that angle,you can't tell. 
 If this is the truth,Kavon goes to jail five years minimum. 
 Stop resisting. Let me go. 
 Come with me to the scene. 
 See thingsfrom my perspective.Okay, that's not... 
 How would you like it if one of your witnesses went investigating? 
 I'd hate it, but I'm notthe lawyer on this case. 
 Come on.You can nap in the car. 
 I'll give you two hours. Okay. 
 Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.Uh-huh. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Huh. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, no,this doesn't look good. 
 Why, Jimmy? Their guys dideverything right. 
 Caseworkis superbly thorough. 
 Two different DNA traces on the victim's body matching thoseof your client, swabbed fromunder the fingernail. 
 It is an emphatic match. 
 Jimmy, I'm gonna ask you something. 
 Why am I not surprised? 
 Is it possible the DNA got there some other way? 
 Maybe Jordan knew him or received a delivery from him. 
 Technically possible,vastly improbable. 
 What about... 
 Secondary transfer. 
 Maybe Jordan had contact earlier that day with whoever actually did the murder, who then carried her DNA with them, and it transferred onto the victim's body? 
 You've been Googling.Once again, technically possible,vastly Jimmy, all I need to establish is... 
 Reasonable doubt. 
 I know. Yes, I just need to convince the jury, and you are gonna help me. 
 Change of plans, Your Honor. My client has elected to reject the terms of the plea deal. 
 Really?We are prepared to go to trial. 
 Ms. Turani, I assume the People have offered As much as they are prepared to offer, Your Honor. 
 Ms. Woodley, you're in agreement? 
 Can I say something, Your Honor? 
 You may. 
 Jordan... 
 The police told me his name Carson. 
 I'm horrified that he died, and I can't stop thinking about his family. 
 But it wasn't me, Your Honor. 
 I couldn't have done that, no matter how drunk. 
 Yes. I'm in agreement. 
 Okay, then. Much better. 
 Counsel? 
 I'm gonna remind you,if this matter goes to trial and if a jury convictsyour client of murder, my hands are tiedwhen it comes to sentencing. 
 My point exactly. 
 Life in prison. No parole for 25 years. 
 Yes, Your Honor. We understand. 
 Okay. You may step back. 
 The plea deal is rejected. We are going to trial. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. Okay, I'm gonna come talk to you. 
 You have been checking that thing every 30 seconds. 
 I may have been a little blame-y with Detective Harris. 
 You two still don't usefirst names? 
 I may have suggested it was his fault the whole... 
 Day drinking?2-martini Tuesday? 
 And now apparently, we are taking a break. 
 By the way, no intel on Detective Daphne Harris. Rivas. 
 How is that even possible?Have you checked TCIS?TCIS. Of course. 
 If she's here, then she'sbeen charged with something. 
 You need to go to the P.D. office and talk to Carol. 
 Stop being all weirdabout that place. 
 It's not that bad. 
 And if you wantyour detective back, then go get him. 
 I have never pursued a man in my life. 
 Hmm?I am the pursuit. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Anything? No security cameras. 
 No ATMs. All right. 
 Walk it through with me.Kavon's there. 
 He's leaningagainst the pole. 
 Like this? More bent at the waist. 
 Like this? 
 Weber's approaching. "Sir, calm down." 
 Listen.I have to study, okay? 
 Hey. Can we go? 
 Whoa! Whoa! 
 Whoa, whoa. Are you okay? Yeah. 
 Are you sure? Hey, give me your hand. 
 You all good? 
 Yeah. I'm okay. Are you sure? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 I know it's not, you know, proof, but I think Kavon just tripped. 
 If me falling has youthinking that, then I feel likeit's even shakier. 
 You're certain enough to testify that it was a trip? 
 Kavon didn't assault Weber. 
 
 
 
 But then Weber gets charges. It's probably a civil suit. 
 Well, Internal Review clearsthis stuff all the time. 
 When it's a criminal's word against the cop. 
 You're a DDA. That carries weight. 
 Even if I'm not certain,shouldn't I voice my doubts? 
 When Kavon was being loaded into that ambulance, blood streaming, my first thought was, this didn't have to happen. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Ms. Kansky. To what do I owe? 
 Uh, Daphne Rivas. What about her? 
 She's been chargedwith something? 
 What did she do?She applied for a job as a filing clerk. 
 Carol.I'm just about to go interview her. 
 Oh. 
 What are you doing here? Leaving. 
 Judge Carmichael would likea word with her after. 
 Anything? 
 Yeah, Jordan Woodley cited for public disturbance, 8:03 p.m. night of the murder. 
 Really? Outside the Palace Theatre. 
 She was singing Eminem tunes. I like her style. 
 8 p.m. She doesn'tremember any of this. 
 Ambulance was called. They would've... 
 Ambulance. The paramedics. 
 What about them? 
 If it was the same onethat... 
 Yes, yes. Ambulance 71. 
 8:03 p.m. It attendson drunk Jordan at the Palace, and then later that night, 10:45 p.m., the same ambulance is calledto the murder scene. 
 The paramedicstransferred the DNA. 
 It sounds far-fetched. 
 Maybe, but... it's possible. 
 It's possible. 
 That's not what I saw. 
 You think I'm lying? I just saw it differently. 
 I know it feels personal. 
 You question my judgment.Mess with my job, it's personal. 
 I have a duty to tell the truth. 
 If the media gets aholdof this, you think me being brown willsave me from the outraged mob? 
 You haven't beenpaying attention. 
 Kavon tripped.Which you got to decidefrom a safe distance after hours of thinkingabout it. 
 I had a split second. 
 Don't you think... The smallest doubt isn't there a part of you that thinks maybe you went too hard? 
 Oh. You don't likethe messy parts. 
 The law isn't somepure idea. 
 It's applied to bodies, and some of those bodiesbleed. 
 He was high, and he was scared. 
 What kind of call will you make if it's life or death? 
 It was. 
 Daphne.It's good to see you. 
 You, too. Am I in trouble? 
 God, no, no. Please, sit. 
 Okay.I just... wanted to check in on you, see how you were doing. 
 I have to admit,when I saw you earlier, I thought maybe you'd been charged again. 
 I was gonna take itpersonally. 
 No. No, that's all behind me. 
 I have a little girl now. 
 Yeah? Mm-hmm. 
 You have a photo? I do. 
 Her name is Sofia. 
 Oh, she is gorgeous. 
 Yeah, I turned my life around. 
 I'm working two jobs, and I'm saving up for school, and I actually just applied to work here, at the P.D.'s office.So I hear. 
 And also, I don't talk to my mother anymore. 
 She's out of my life. 
 That must have been difficult. 
 She used to be different, and people change, I guess. 
 It just took me a little while to catch up. 
 Well, I am very proudof you. 
 Well, what about you, Your Honor? 
 You're good? 
 Mm, some daysare better than others. 
 Today is oneof the good ones because of you, Daphne. 
 We can all do way more than we think we can. 
 You said that to me. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 When you get that jobin the P.D.'s office, don't be a stranger, okay? 
 Okay. 
 There has to bemore photos. 
 There are. Okay. 
 Mm. 
 Look at her. 
 One citation. That's all I can find. 
 I don't have an alibi, and, yes, I can go after the confessionand the priors, but the key to this whole thingis the DNA. 
 And the problem is thateven if I put Jimmy Slimms on the stand,and even if he makes a brilliant casefor secondary transfer, which he will,the prosecution's guy will just refute it.It's battle of the experts. 
 They willcancel each other out, and I am dead in the water. 
 Boom! He told Judge Benner. 
 You weren't talking to me just now, were you? 
 Hey. 
 Tell me everything. 
 Every detail from the beginning. 
 I am gamblingwith this woman's life. 
 Why do I think I can pull this off? 
 Are you kidding me? You can do anything. 
 Have I told youabout step 11 do something every daythat brings you pleasure? 
 Thought you might liketo, you know, pitch in. 
 I am really stressed right now. 
 I could give yousomething for that. 
 Ow. I'm so sorry. 
 It's okay. My ankle hurts. I have to study. 
 I get it. I'm sorry. 
 Okay. 
 The samples collected from the right hand generated two profiles of alleles one male and one female. 
 He's good. 
 He's too good.It's battle of the experts. 
 It's okay. Jimmy's good, too. 
 But if I can get this guyto sign on to my theory, I can win this whole thingright here, right now. 
 That's too risky. Just trust Jimmy Slimms. 
 ...next to a level of 1 in 17 quintillion. 
 That's 17 with 18 zeroes after it. 
 Nothing further, Your Honor. 
 Ms. Lopez, your witness. 
 Dr. Lee, this profile you built, it came from just a few cells of DNA, correct? 
 Oh, yes.The technology is surging. 
 Our instrumentsare uber sensitive. 
 And these couple of tiny cells were found on the victim's right hand? Correct. Right index finger. 
 Was my client's DNA found anywhere else on the victim's body? 
 It was not. Is your conclusion that my client was present at the crime scene? 
 No, my conclusion was her DNAwas at the scene, which is why So you can't actually place my client Objection. Argumentative. Overruled. 
 It's likely she was at the scene, given the presence of Likely. I see. Is Is there any other way these tiny cells could have Secondary transfer. 
 Yes. The victim would have to have touched with his right index finger something your client also touched highly unlikely. 
 Thank you, doctor. 
 Now can you tell me what this is? 
 A pulse oximeter. 
 Used to checkblood oxygen levels.Paramedics use it? 
 Yes.So it would've been used on the victim at the murder scene to check his vitals? Yes. 
 And where would they have placed it on his body? 
 Right index finger. 
 Objection, Your Honor. Calls for speculation. 
 Overruled, Counsel.Sit down. 
 Doctor, drawing your attention to Peoples' Exhibit 4, can you tell the court, please, which ambulance attended at the murder scene? 
 71. Rescue Ambulance 71. 
 Your Honor, marking Defense Exhibit "B" a medical report from my client less than three hours prior. 
 And this ambulance number? 
 Also 71. 
 Same ambulance. Same paramedics.Same pulse oximeter. 
 Doctor Lee, could my client's DNA transfer to the victim by means of the oximeter? 
 Could she, in fact, have been nowhere near the victim or the crime? 
 Would you say that that is reasonable? 
 Doctor? 
 I would. 
 Nothing further, Your Honor. 
 The bar's a marathon,not a sprint. 
 No more caffeine. 
 Callan. A moment. 
 And get some sleep. Sleep is for the weak. 
 Am I headedfor the penalty box? 
 I prefer "sin bin." 
 Not this time. 
 Diaz wants to plead Kavondown to misdemeanor resisting. 
 That's...surprising. 
 Maybe the D.A. sawa P.R. disaster in the making. 
 Or maybe it's the best call, given the facts. 
 And...Weber? 
 We don't ask peopleto make the right choices with perfect information, just reasonable choices with what they know. 
 We...done? 
 Kavon gets a good deal.Isn't that what you want? 
 I think...I want to know I made the right choice. 
 Sticking to your story? 
 About this. About all of it. 
 Do you ever wonder if you are where you're supposed to be? 
 In my experience, if a D.A. asksthat question, a case comes along to answer it. 
 What kind of case? 
 You'll know it. 
 If you take 3rdall the way up, make that right,you'll be fine. 
 Great. Thanks. No problem. 
 Detective. 
 What can I do for you, Prosecutor? 
 I was... 
 For the cause. 
 Judge Benner? 
 Well, I'm not gonna, like, damage your son or something, if that's what you're worried about. 
 He told youI was overprotective. 
 Yes, and I am, but not of him. 
 Sara, I love my son,and I always will. 
 But how can I say this? 
 Um, just...be careful. 
 Hey. What was that? You okay? 
 I'm not sure. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I can't talk right now, but I'll talk to you later,okay? 
 Hi. 
 Oh. Go ahead. She's waiting. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 Your Honor? You wanted to see me? 
 Emily, come on in. 
 How are you? Everything good? Yeah, everything's good. 
 That was some high stakes poker. 
 That cross? 
 Well, it worked. 
 Every time you appear in my courtroom, Emily, I see something in you something I recognize. 
 Your whole life you've done it all by yourself everything you've achieved, and there isn't anything you can't fix, right? 
 Including your clients, including yourself, one step at a time. 
 I have been in therapy more than once. 
 Three different therapists. It never worked for me. 
 Me, neither.Just made it worse. 
 Until I met Dr. Bhatti. 
 Just in case. 
 You are not alone, Emily. 
 Don't ever forget that, okay? 
 We have got you... surrounded. 
 Thanks. Thank you. 
 Good, 'cause I wasn't sliding this under the door. 
 Strawberry rhubarb pie? Mm-hmm. 
 That's my favorite. I know. 
 Let's get right into this. 
 Listen, Mom. 
 We don't always get to know if the hard work is worth it. 
 We do it on faith, but if we're lucky, we'll get a sign. 
 Oh, look at youwith the tough love. 
 We can all do way more than we think we can. 
 You taught me those words. 
 Today I got the gift of seeing its impact. 
 My mother taught methose words. 
 Remember when you and Grandma Ella took me to the NAACP meeting? 
 I was what,in high school? 
 Almost grown, couldn't sit still. 
 Why did you stop going? 
 Well, I guess I justhad my own fight, and it started to feellike a place for oldladies. 
 Well, you are an old lady now. 
 What can I do to help? 
 Pass the pie. 
 I'm serious. So is she. 
 Eat pie. Stay close. 
 Mmm-mmm-mmm. 
 Ooh. 
 I could do this on my own. 
 I knew exactly what to do, how to approach the problem and solve it. 
 I had the skill. I could see the path, the steps, and I keep thinking that I should be able to do that with this with this thing, this...with this problem. 
 But you can't. 
 I have no clue... where to begin, even. 
 I'm lost. 
 I need help. 
 I went shopping. 
 I, uh, I should hydrate. 
 It's mostly water. 
 I don't know if the copswill buy that argument. 
 How'd it go with Choi? 
 I will live to fight another day. 
 You know, I became a D.A. to help people. 
 Did you? Or was it to piss off your dad? 
 Both. 
 Yeah. 
 People grow out of things. 
 No idea what will come next. 
 Well, whatever it is,you'll make it interesting. 
 Come on. 
 But I'm... 
 All right. 
 You know you forgetthe end of that quote. 
 "We can all do betterthan we think we can, but we can't do it alone." 
 I am not alone, Mom. 
 Oh, so you and Robinare all right? 
 We will be. 
 I think I will go downto the NAACP and see whatthe old ladiesare up to. 
 I think it would be good for you. 
 Hmm. 
 Mmm. 
 Mmm-mmm-mmm. 
 This is so good. 
 Yeah? Mm-hmm.
