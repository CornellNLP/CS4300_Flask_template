 Previously on "All Rise"... 
 Ms. Powell, meet Sergeant Wayne McCarthy, board member of the Association of L.A. 
 Deputy Sheriffs. 
 - Hey! 
 Is that Big Mick? 
 - Watkins! 
 I miss my courtroom. 
 I miss my peeps. 
 Focus on baby Bailey. 
 Everything's gonna be back to normal when you return. 
 - I can't believe I, uh... 
 - No, me neither. 
 Can we just pretend the... 
 kiss never happened? 
 Got it. 
 Never happened. 
 After we discuss Mark. 
 I really feel like Mark and I have a future. 
 - You do, of course... 
 - I don't know how I'm gonna tell him. 
 I'm married. 
 ♪♪    Is that a Pop-Tart? 
 What, are you late for school? 
 [BELL DINGS] 
 - Oh. 
 - At least I have the decency to toast mine. 
 Never thought I'd live to see Mark Callan abstain from his morning protein. 
 These little beauties happen to be part of a great American ritual known as str... 
 Stress eating? 
 Same. 
 Go ahead. 
 Spill. 
 I feel like I'm at a standstill with the list of sheriff's deputies. 
 - I have no leads. 
 - Luke wasn't helpful? 
 I actually haven't talked to him yet. 
 His desk is   feet from your office. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 It's actually more work not to talk to him. 
 I know. 
 It's touchy. 
 He still feels like he has a relationship with these guys in the department. 
 I... 
 just wish I knew why his name was on that list. 
 Well, you won't know until you talk to him. 
 I will, today. 
 You're up, Waffles. 
 [GROANS] 
 For the next two weeks, Audubon and Associates will just be Associates. 
 Where's Audubon going? 
 She's flying out tonight to New York to court a potential big client to save the firm since she insisted we pass on Uncle Richie's gold mine. 
 - She's either losing it... 
 - [SIGHS] 
 ...or she is in desperate need of a vacation. 
 I guess she's just eager to get away. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 [SWALLOWS] 
 I just... mean we're in a... pandemic, is all. 
 I don't know. 
 She seems a little too eager. 
 Mm. 
 [SIGHS] 
 "She is hard-headed, immovable, "unwilling to abide by judicial decorum,    
 - or respectability politics."  
 - What is this,     
 - a performance review or a roast? 
 -  Those were the nice things. 
 That's high praise coming from Judge Carmichael. 
 Now as a clerk, you don't have much time left with us. 
 You will need to decide what your future will be. 
 
 Which is why I want you to shadow as many offices in the H.O.J. as possible. - Mm-hmm. - Y'all are trying to get rid of me? Quite the opposite. I wanna keep you in this building, somewhere that you can use that voice of yours. And preferably somewhere we can't hear it. Now gather your things. - I'm starting today? - Mm-hmm. - Where am I shadowing? - P.D.'s office. Carol owed me a favor. The P.D.s have more cases than days in the year. Plus I think they still use dial-up internet. Okay, well, you are working with Emily Lopez. What is this, trial by fire? She's almost as scary as you. You are there to observe, which is why that shouldn't matter. Please keep your nose where it should be. No promises. Try not to miss me too much. Why do I feel like we're going to regret this? You got to let 'em fly sometime. Uh-oh. I know that look. What's wrong? - Shadowing Emily Lopez today. - Oh, you'll be fine. Just try and dial down that whole Ness thing. [SINGSONGY] Good luck! Watch out, H.O.J. Those two could start an uprising. Hey, you are not getting off that easy. I want to hear  all  about your night with Professor Jennings. It was great. She was great. Come on! I am trying to live vicariously through you. [MOUTH FULL] What do you want me to say? That I never expected to meet someone so enrapturing at this point in my life? Oh, look at you. - You are totally gushing. - [CHUCKLES] Yes, I worry over when she's gonna text me back. I've got this running list of ideas for future dates. It's all very exhausting. Ugh, I'd kill to have something special smack me over the head right now just to break up the monotony. Be careful what you ask for, Castillo. You might just get it. Lopez, reporting for duty. Oh, uh, this is happening today. Sure is. Great. Okay. I will find a way to make this work. I just hope you weren't expecting a crash course in being a public defender. Never been a fan of following instructions anyway. I'm here to make your job easier. Well, first lesson in being a P.D... The job is never easy, and the best thing you can do to help me is to give me my space to do my thing. While I'm sure you're an untapped well of potential, I'm used to working alone. Mr. Garcia, I see your arm's in a sling today. When did that happen? Three months ago I got jumped near Echo Park. This group just started pounding. I blacked out, and when I woke up, cops were there. They jacked my Jordans. Marking this photo People's  . Do you recognize what's depicted here? Yes. The limited edition Air Jordans that they stole from me. Do you see one of those people that attacked you      - here in the courtroom today? - Yeah, he's there. CAMPBELL: Identifying the defendant, Mr. Julian Taylor. Did you threaten the defendant in any way     - before you were attacked? - Nope. Hadn't seen him in years. So this wasn't the first time you'd seen Mr. Taylor. No, we went to the same high school. He always had beef, except back then, he went by "Phantom," back when he ran with the Shadow Squad. Objection. Relevance. Unduly prejudicial. Overruled. Both Mr. Taylor's previous gang affiliation and his relationship to Mr. Garcia are most certainly relevant. Your Honor, any gang affiliation has no relevance. There is no gang enhancement alleged. This is nothing more than improper character evidence. - Ms. Lopez. - Right. - [LOWERED VOICE] Don't let him bait you. - I won't. No further questions. All right, your witness, Ms. Lopez. Mr. Garcia, you did not see my client at the scene before you lost consciousness, correct? Yeah, that's right, but they had their faces covered. And you did not see my client hit you either, right? I got knocked out, so, no, I didn't. In fact, the only time you observed my client at the scene was when he was in police custody after you regained consciousness, correct? Doesn't mean he wasn't there beforehand. This is exactly the kind of thing he'd do. Objection. Speculation. Lack of foundation. Lack of personal knowledge and improper character evidence. Sustained. And you said to your knowledge, he was a member of the Shadow Squad. Do you know that because you were a member, too? - [SIGHS] - No. He was notorious in our hood. And you say you knew him from then. Isn't it true that was at least three years ago? You mean before he was locked up. Motion to strike. Nonresponsive and    . - Stricken. - Y'all know he got locked up for beating down some other guy. Objection. No question pending. LUKE: Judge Campbell... - This is typical gang stuff. - He's always had it out for me! - The court will come to order. - LUKE: Objection! Oh, you're calling me a liar? - That's not who I am anymore! - Oh, yeah. Be quiet! You may say this isn't who you are, but right now you are not helping your case! So if you cannot behave yourself, we will conduct this trial without you. Court's in recess till   a.m. tomorrow. I didn't mean to. Is it always this intense? I mean, I've seen my fair share of court, but nothing like this. [SCOFFS] Buckle up. We're just getting started. ♪♪     Ms. Lopez. You have to convince the judge that my brother has changed. Who you just saw... He's not like that. Cameron, I am gonna do everything I can to help your brother, okay? Everything, I promise. Just... Just hang in there. Come on. [SCOFFS] Your client's outburst was gnarly. Campbell's record for violent reoffenders isn't pretty. That flare-up has likely confirmed every assumption Campbell has been making since the trial began. You know Campbell's gonna slam him in sentencing. The prosecution make a decent offer? Yes, and Julian was gonna agree, but then they asked him to name the other assailants. [SCOFFS] Let me guess. He isn't talking. Nope. It doesn't help that he had a gun on him. He claims it wasn't his, but he picked it up off the ground. No, you can't really believe him. Actually, I do. Some clients you just know. That's one hell of a dose of optimism. Uh... hold that thought. Hey. What happened to Mr. Restorative Justice? Not every case is a good candidate. - I've gotta pick my battles. - How is he not a new candidate? Is this what I have to look forward to? Courtroom showdowns between opposing counsel? Very standard. You'll be a natural. Julian is young. He is rehabilitated... How did you get Emily to sign off     - on shadowing the P.D.'s office? - Oh, she didn't. Her boss did, with a little arm-twisting from Lola. Well, you already got my number. Give me a call when you're ready to shadow the D.A.'s office. - Yeah. - Ms. Johnson, keep up, please. Julian excelled during his probation, okay? He worked so hard to turn his life around. He held down two jobs. He practically raised his younger brother. That probation was on a violent felony, so he already had a strike. He was arrested at the crime scene. At the end of the day, I'm still a prosecutor, and your guy's guilty, plain and simple. You may be singing a different tune after we present our case. Oh, she's got tricks up her sleeve, huh? She's got tricks. They're shaking in their boots. You can tell. Lunch later? I brought a lunch from home that's best eaten at my desk. We can't have lunch anymore? We can, just not today. ♪♪     - [CELLPHONE CHIMES] - Albert, to what do I owe the pleasure? Hey, I'm gonna need you to talk me off the ledge a second here. Okay. Does the name Julian Taylor  ring a bell? Should it? Well, you were the prosecutor on his robbery case three years ago, and guess what? He's back in court today. I can't remember everyone I prosecuted. Well, maybe if you'd just filed for more serious charges the first time, maybe he might have learned  something instead of just getting a slap on the wrist. I mean, somebody could have  died here, you know, for God's sake. Is this you blaming me for a felon reoffending? [SIGHS] No. I'm angry, and I need somebody to hash this out with. Okay. I'm listening. You know, it's not like it's my first rodeo. You know, I've tried dozens of reoffenders, and I ask myself the same thing every time. Why? You know, why... why do we give these guys a second chance? You know, if they're not even willing to seize the opportunity? But your trial hasn't concluded yet. Well, it's this... it's the same charge. It's a previous gang affiliation. Well, he isn't on trial for his past. Don't let your perception of him color your perception of this case. Oh, don't. Oh, don't. Are you accusing me of being biased? What I'm saying is there is always a more holistic approach when dealing... You know, I've come to talk to a friend. Getting a judge and a jury here, so I thank you as always  for your candor, and I do appreciate it, Judge Carmichael. It wasn't my intention to... [BEEP] ♪♪     [INHALING AND EXHALING DEEPLY] - [DOOR OPENS] - Campbell should have never allowed the gang information during cross. But at least it gives us the chance to provide some good character evidence to rebut the bad, so... So we need character witnesses. That's already done. The problem is our investigator compiled a list, and none of them agreed to testify. Okay, so this dude doesn't have at least one person to go to bat for him? That kind of sucks. It's not your job to determine whether or not he is sus. If you are this man's lawyer, you are his last hope of freedom. Doesn't mean I can't judge him on my own time. Okay, well, then you're not gonna last very long in this office, because that attitude is quite counterproductive. Okay, I'll show you productive. Give me one of those phone numbers to call. I'm actually good, thank you, on the calls. I will do them myself. But thanks. [DIALING TELEPHONE] [WHISPERS] Oh. Luke, can I talk to you in my office for a minute? That's the latest drop from our anonymous source. And you got this from... The same source who helped us put away Deputy Rashel. That's a lot of people getting ready to feel the wrath of Mark Callan. What'd they do? I'm not sure yet. You didn't include me before. Why now? Because your name's on it. Luke, I know this is a lot to unload on you. Can you see anything that connects your name to the rest of those names? I mean, they're all sheriff's deputies. - Anything else? - Hey, listen,     this is not a list of killer cops, if that's what you're asking. Luke, I know you go way back with some of these guys. Listen, I don't recognize every name on this list, but for the guys that I do, they're good people. You know, like, this guy... He took a bullet for me, okay, my first year as a rookie. It was a bust out in Long Beach. And this guy... I was the best man at his wedding. Luke, that's all very nice, but I'm gonna go ahead and assume this isn't a list of wedding attendees. - So then what do you think it is? - I don't know. I know that some of these guys are like family to you. But if my source put that on my desk, it's because it's important. I've got a trial that I need to get ready for. Luke, Luke, come on. ♪♪     [FUSSING] I really wish I could let you hold her. I get it. Trust me, I'm vastly underqualified. Yeah, that checks out. I gotta admit, I never pictured you as the motherly type. Excuse me, I always planned on being a hot mom. Life just hasn't given me the mom part yet. Hmm, is that why it's taken you so long to visit Bailey? - What do you mean? - You have barely even called. I've been a little busy watching my goals take a nosedive. Oh, what did you expect? You started your law firm the day you moved back to L.A. I was being proactive. You were jumping headfirst. You didn't even take the time to think ahead. You never do... We can't all be perfect, calculated Lola with the dream job and the sexy FBI husband and the beautiful baby girl. Some of us make impulsive decisions like funneling all their money into far-flung dreams and kissing their good friend from law school. You kissed Mark?! Rachel. Nah-unh-unh. He takes some of the blame. He was a willful and enthusiastic participant. He goes down with me. He is your business partner's live-in boyfriend. It's not... It's not a big deal. It's like Mark and I were living in that moment of anticipation since law school. And now that it's happened, we can just turn the page and move on. - Rachel, don't tell me... - Moving on. But there is no moving on. These kinds of things have a ripple effect. Well, hopefully I won't be here to see it. I have a plane to catch. You are trifling. You can't just up and run every time your decisions catch up to you. My flight gets in late. I'll call you in the morning. Talk soon. I miss you already. If Julian is such a pillar of his community like you say, why won't they rally for him? It could be plenty of things. They couldn't get off work. They don't trust the system. Or maybe they know something about him that we don't. [SQUEAKY WHIRRING] Hey, easy. - She will get there. - She? Norma might be old, but in this office, she is family. The equipment in this office is dusty. Do you all at least got something to eat around here? There is a snack basket to the left. - [LINE RINGING] - Oh. That is tragic. MAN'S VOICE: You have reached the voicemail of... That is the third character witness who did not answer their phone. Well, when's the last time you picked up the phone from somebody you didn't recognize? If they refused to testify the first time they got a call from an unknown number, what makes you think they'll be game now? So you've done this before? Do you have any other wisdom that you would like to impart? What if we roll through Julian's community and talked to the people in person? Ness, I would actually really love to do that, okay? But P.D.s don't have the time to go gallivanting... Campbell called recess for the rest of the day. And we've got a fat stack of files awaiting us at the end of the road. You know the beautiful thing about files? They're portable. - I hear phones are these days, too. - [LINE RINGING] Unless you're afraid to find out that you're wrong about Julian. Okay. [RING] MALE VOICE: The voicemail of the person you're calling... Fine. Grab your keys. We'll see who's wrong. [SIGHS] [WHISPERS] Yes! [LAUGHS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Judge Carmichael is here to see you. Lola? Where? [LOWERED VOICE] This is a covert operation. Please adjust your volume accordingly. [THUNDER RUMBLES] She's in courtroom    . Hurry! While the coast is clear! Uh-oh. - [DOOR CLOSES] - Intruder alert. - Should I sound the alarms? - Don't you dare. Let me have my moment of peace. Well, you're just taking a leave from your maternity leave? I was already cooking up a plan to get out of the house, but when you hung up on me while I was still speaking, I knew exactly where I had to go. I apologize. This case ruffled your feathers. Well, I admit I was a bit snippy earlier. The Judge Campbell I know is considerably more measured. - I have it under control. - I'm sure you do. But it wouldn't hurt to talk it out, would it? [EXHALES DEEPLY] You must be the new judge. No, I'm not. I'm Nikki. My mom's friend is a judge. They're having lunch without me. That doesn't seem fair. Well, they invited me, but I declined. I have business to attend to, like studying for this stupid math test. I take it you don't like math? Never have, but I don't hate it because it's cool to hate it like everyone else. I hate it because I actually hate it. [CHUCKLES] You know, I used to hate math, too. Then I, um, picked up a few tricks to make it easier. You want me to show you? You're an adult. Don't you have a job to do? Adults need breaks, too. Bring it over. You know, judges have the power to break cycles of bad behavior. Second chances are a part of that system. There is no accountability in a second chance, okay? Harsh sentences give weight to the crime that's committed. And that same sentencing affects certain communities disproportionately and leads to mass incarceration,    - which we can both agree... - Yeah. - ...is not helpful. - All right, fair enough. Each person should receive a sentence that balances the crime that they've committed with their potential for rehabilitation. The leniency has its place, but a violent charge... But you are forgetting that violence is often a cycle. I forget nothing. Victims can become aggressors. Think about all of the injustices that could have occurred in a defendant's life, all of the days in court that never were. - Does it excuse what they did? - It does not. But it can help us to understand why they did it. Why? Why, why, why,     why is the "why?" so important to you? We all have our "whys."     In learning them, we can assess each other with more fairness. For example, why did you become a judge? Because I believe that no man is above the law, and no man is below it. Theodore Roosevelt. That's right. Always stuck with me. What about Albert Campbell? What happened in your life that made you decide, "I need to be on that bench"? ♪♪     Remember, I am doing the talking, and you are... Observing with my mouth shut. Got it. - ♪ It's happiness we're fighting for ♪  - [CELLPHONE RINGS] ♪ I'm on the run, I'm out the door ♪ Hey, uh, it's not a good time right now. Can I call you later? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Bye. Bye. Was that the hot guy with the floppy hair  - from the Christmas party? - Can you stay in your lane, for like, I don't know, two seconds? You cannot bring that type of eye candy to the H.O.J. and expect people not to ask questions. Eye candy's name is Joaquin, and he's in Miami for a little while. Is that cool with you? Still working out our long distance thing, but for now we don't have ties to each other. Okay. Well, I'd keep him in your back pocket. The only chance of scoring anyone these days is at work. That is a dangerous game. You think? Oh, when you were dating Luke, was the cross-office antagonism awkward, or was it hot lying in bed with the enemy? That is a little personal and very specific. Why? You got your eye on someone at the H.O.J.? - Me? Ah. - Okay. - Ooh, ah, ah. - I see you, mystery person. [LAUGHS] Thank you again for speaking with us. How long have you known Julian? Since he was in the children's choir. He was a scrappy kid. Sweet, but he had a whole lot of fire. - How so? - Well, on Sundays, he would volunteer to unload chairs. He'd arrive here hours before mass would start. - Then he stopped coming. - When was that? Sometime around high school. He became angry at the world, his circumstances, life. He had a lot of growing up to do after his first brush with the law. - You think he succeeded? - I hoped he had. Guess I was wrong. Is that why you refuse to speak with my investigator? Isn't it true that Julian gave frequent testimonials here     - about his experience behind bars? - He did. And we have on record that he completed his community service here, so if he's poured so much of his life into this church, is he not deserving of a few kind words from you in court? I learned a long time ago I can't save everyone. ♪♪     [TELEPHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE] I hear Luke didn't take it so well. Those guys are his family. Asking him to turn his back on them is no small thing. So he can't do it. What's your next move for the list? At this point, all I can do is go name to name, start reaching out. You're forgetting something, Callan. Cops hate you. There's no way anyone's gonna talk. Maybe Luke will actually listen to  you. [SIGHS] I don't know. We haven't exactly been buddy-buddy recently. You guys have always made a great team, and I could use one of those right now. ♪♪     It's not what he said. It was how he was acting, like I wasn't on the team, like he was suspicious. He didn't mean it. He knows you're on his team. Well, what if I'm not? I've been trying to play for both teams, but I don't wanna betray anyone. Do you know something about this list that you're not telling us? Maybe. But I don't know what it means. Okay, listen, coming from a cop family, I've had a lot of uncomfortable conversations. We want cops to be better, to be a source of good in the world. Sometimes taking someone to task is the ultimate gesture of love. I just don't know what I have to say about him. Julian started working here as a busboy in high school, so you've known him for a while. He was a troubled kid. We weren't very close. When Julian was released, you reached out to him and hired him back as a server. You made him employee of the month on several occasions, and you don't know what you'd have to say about him? Look, if it's not about food safety, customer service, tardiness, I can't speak to it. Julian clearly butts heads with authority figures. How was his attendance record? He shows up for most of his shifts. Most. What could be more important than making a shift? He has a lot on his plate. He just signed up for a second gig volunteering at a youth center. Well, how would you characterize the kids at the youth program? Rebellious? Delinquent? I only know the few that work here. Uh-huh. Were they here on the morning of the incident? A couple of them missed their shifts. It's not unusual. They're in and out sometimes. Which ones? We're really busy here. I think it's time you left. [HUMMING] Well, what the hell was that? I know. Something is seriously up with these people. I'm talking about your leading questions. You were supposed to be a fly on the wall. I had a hunch. It just doesn't make sense. If these people have all the praises in the world in their arsenal for Julian, why won't they use them? It's like somebody is... Is telling them to stand down. What if they are? What  if  somebody is influencing them? ♪♪     Oh! Nikki, you missed one. Right there. Oh. That looks like it hurts. Nah. I'm tough. Plus it looks kinda cool, like if you squint, it could be a purple lion. I bet, um, you're happy to get out of the house. Uh-huh. I hate being stuck at home. When I was   , I saw my older brother get beaten down in a parking lot. It was just kind of a random mugging. I wanted to intervene, and I wanted to help him, but I froze. All I could do is just watch as this grown man you know, bloodied up this person I loved. That is so horrible. I had to testify in court. And I learned his assailant had previously been convicted of felony assault and released on parole. - Albert... - Well, you know, that made no sense to me. This man had hurt people, and they let him out to do it again. My brother and I never spoke about the incident. Eventually, we never spoke about anything. When you jumped in front of that gun at the protest, you... you carry that night with you. Do you find it still affects you? It does, but I have surrounded myself with a team of people who helped me and support me through it. It's not too late for you to do the same. Well, I mean, don't worry about me. It's not a fresh wound, but... You talk about it like it happened yesterday. Maybe your anger against violent offenders stems from that incident... A need for revenge. I mean, I will allow that that incident lit a fire under me but not to take vengeance. From the bench, I've got a voice, and I can use it to help people understand the impact of their crimes. But don't let the power you have now distract you from your duty to remain impartial. [EXHALES DEEPLY] I won't be away for too long. Just long enough to wine and dine a prospective client, poke around on some other leads. But do you really think a business trip is the best use of company resources right now? Absolutely. The rewards far outweigh the risks. I will check in the minute I land in New York, okay? Okay, because we still have a lot to discuss. I mean... Mark can be a pain in the ass, but he's a good guy. You two have gotten serious. You need to come clean about your marriage. - I will when the time is right. - When will that be? When he gets down on one knee, what are you gonna say, "I can't marry you. I gotta get a divorce"? 
 
 I won't let it get that far. No, you won't, because you're going to do it now. The longer you wait, the more of his trust you lose. ♪♪     Yes, girl, you've got it. Sara, you've met Nikki. Well, of course you have. This is Whitney. We go way back. - Oh, hi. It's a pleasure to meet you. - Hi. [CHUCKLES] Mom, Sara helped me with my math problems. - She's really smart. - She's the best. Well, that's very nice of you. Do you have a card? - Uh, pardon? - Well, Nikki's been needing some help with a tutor, so we'd love to keep in touch. Well, that's not a bad idea. Oh, well, I'm not a real teacher. I mean, that's not something I usually do. Please, Sara? Uh... Yeah. Sure. - Oh. - I'll get you Sara's details. Great. Thank you. Okay, sweetheart. Let's go. - All right. I'll see you out. - Bye. - Bye, Sara. - Later, Nikki. [FOOTSTEPS DEPART] [GRUNTS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Does Julian know you're here? My discussions with my client aren't something I can disclose. - Right. - We're hoping to get some info on my client's whereabouts on the day of the incident. Has Julian spoken with you at all about what happened? I really can't talk to you right now. I think you should go. But we know Julian used to mentor youth here. We also know his little brother Cameron is in your program. [BOY SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] It doesn't matter what you know. Oh. Nice. Back in place. Keep it going. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] - BOY: J.J.! - Good. Hey, Emily. - Yeah? - You see that kid? He's wearing the same limited edition Air Jordans stolen from Stephon. You camp out on Fairfax for those types of shoes, and unless he's working five jobs... That can't be a coincidence. Julian could have given him the shoes after the robbery. No, that's impossible. Julian was arrested at the scene of the crime and immediately taken into custody. You think this kid could have been an accomplice? Or what if Julian was covering for him, or a group of kids in the program? That could be why no one in this community will talk to us. Julian told them to let him take the fall. ♪♪     [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] I've been trying to secure character witnesses, but none of the people in your life will talk to me. Do you know why that is? You ever heard the saying, "Let sleeping dogs lie?" Julian, I wanna help you. I'm... I'm trying to help you, but you... you have to let me in, all right? Your entire trial is riding on the words of witnesses who won't testify. They won't do it. For some reason, they won't talk. Well, maybe I'm a lost cause. We both know that's not true. I went by the youth center. Saw a kid wearing a very unique pair of Air Jordans. You didn't tell anyone, did you? No, and I won't, but if you wanna walk, you need to tell me the full story. I can't. Look... the gun found on your person wasn't registered, okay? Maybe you obtained it illegally. Maybe it wasn't yours. Maybe you took it off the hands of one of those kids. All those theories you came up with... forget them. You have one life, and I will not let you just throw it away. It's already gone, but those kids... They still have a chance. Did you cover for one of 'em? - Did you cover for them? - Guards! - Did you cover for them? - This meeting's over. - [DOOR BUZZES] - Julian, did you cover for one of them? Julian. - [HANDCUFFS CLICK] - Julian. Bye, Ms. Lopez. [DOOR BUZZES] ♪♪     [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Hey, you have a minute? Of course. Come on in. [TELEPHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE] I'm sorry about earlier. I overreacted. Luke, I hope you know that I would never accuse you of misconduct. I know that. In the Sheriff's Department, when someone you know messes up, you... you give them the benefit of the doubt and you assume that they have reasonable cause. You never wanna imagine that a person you respect would ever act out of malicious intent. Especially not the one person on the force that you're taught to trust the most. Your training officer? McCarthy is the common denominator, isn't he? He trained everyone on that list. ♪♪     [CELLPHONE RINGS] Hey, uh, sorry, um, I can't actually chat right now. Can make it up tonight over pizza and hard seltzer? [CHUCKLES] Okay. Deal. Damn, she's got pizza and seltzer money. Mnh-mnh, don't question the tactics. I question the timing. Evening plans don't survive in this office. Screw evening plans. Julian didn't do it. And we are this close to breaking through to him. What I don't get is why he still won't let anybody say nice things about him on the stand. They know too much. During cross-examination, they'll be questioned about that night... - about those kids. - [THUMP] He would rather stick his own neck out there, than... than ask them to perjure themselves. Must be personal if he's so willing to throw himself on his own sword. I asked our investigator to look into it, and guess who was missing from the kitchen staff on the day of the incident... His brother Cameron. - You think he's involved? - He's in that youth program, so he runs with that crowd. Okay, well, then let's get him on the phone. Yes, yes. [SIGHS] Damn. Five missed calls from Carol, and she texted. What is it? There was a... there was a riot at Men's Central. Julian tried to break it up. He's dead. ♪♪     - We need to get the paperwork started. - Emily... Next of kin has already been notified. I'm not sure if that's his brother Cameron... Will you please stop? Your client just died. You don't have to pretend that you are okay. [SIGHS] [TELEPHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE] Judge Campbell will dismiss the charges. That much is a given, but... I'm more concerned about Julian's family. They may not receive justice, but they deserve closure. You should talk to Campbell. No. We should. Just need to make a few calls first. [DIALING TELEPHONE] [WAVES LAPPING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in. Do you have a moment? Wonderful weather, isn't it? It rains in the game, too, you know, so... - We take it you've heard the news. - I have. We wanted to discuss the impending dismissal. There is gonna be a grieving family sitting in that gallery. Julian's time in custody was never meant to be a death sentence. The system cannot right that wrong, but we can still honor Julian. How can we make this better? He had a troubled past, but he was... He was turning his life around. We believe that he was innocent, that he took the fall for a group of people that he loved, and that is the Julian who deserves to be on the record. The law dictates that I dismiss the charges, nothing more. I can't say any of this in court. It just goes beyond my position here. And you don't have to. There are    witnesses waiting in the gallery who are more than happy to speak to Julian's redemption, and all you have to do is give them permission. AMY: Hey, when you get home tonight, there's something we should talk about. It's important. - [LINE RINGING] - [SIGHS] I have been waiting for you to call. Of course. Rachel told you. To her credit, I don't think she meant to. - It just kinda slipped out. - Well, loose lips sink ships. I would be more concerned about controlling      - your own lips than hers. -  She kissed me. No, you don't get to play innocent. It takes two. Okay, look, I... I screwed up. And I feel terrible about it, but it... it's never gonna happen again. Yeah, but this is a pattern with you. The moment a relationship gets good, You have to find a way to sabotage it. You didn't kiss Rachel because you have strong feelings for her. You kissed Rachel because you are madly in love with Amy. [SIGHS] You're right. So... What do I do? You need to make this right and be honest with Amy. Tell her about the kiss. You already broke her trust. Now it's time to build it again. All rise. Department of the Los Angeles Superior Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Albert Campbell presiding. Please be seated. [SIGHS] All right, we are back on the record in  People v. Taylor. Court has received information that Mr. Taylor has died in custody. Because he is deceased, the court will be dismissing the case. Mr. Taylor will not be convicted of this crime. But our business is not done here. I would like to invite the friends and family of Mr. Taylor to deliver impact statements. So if anyone wishes to rise and speak to Mr. Taylor's character, the court would very much like to hear what you have to say. [EXHALES DEEPLY] [SNIFFLES] Julian was a lot of things, but he was my brother first. Anytime I need him, he'd drop everything to be there. But he was one call away even when he was behind bars. I don't know what to do... now that he's gone. [JADEN HARTMANN'S "ONE LAST" PLAYING] Cameron? ♪ Hold me ♪ - We're so sorry for your loss. - Thank you, Ms. Lopez, for everything you did for my brother. You believed in him. I did, and he believed in you. He was willing to put himself on the line for all those kids at the youth center... or maybe for you. ♪♪     And he did all that so that you would not go down the same path that he did. That was his parting gift. It's up to you to take it. He would have wanted you to go back to school, run with a better crowd, get your life together. Think of this as your second chance, okay? Will you do that for him? I will. I promise. All right. ♪ In the end ♪ ♪ One last day ♪ ♪ One last time ♪ ♪ One last kiss ♪ ♪ Before goodbye ♪ ♪ I don't know ♪ ♪ If it's going to be ♪ ♪ Okay ♪ [BIRDS CHIRPING] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS CONTINUE] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey! - Is that Watkins? - Ah, looking sharp, son. - Ah, look at this guy. - Ah, we haven't seen you at one of these for a while. He dropped our asses the moment he sold his soul to the D.A. Hey, now. Luke's running the same relay race as the rest of us. He's just picking up the baton. Everything all right? Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something. Well, why does it sound like D.D.A. Watkins talking? And here I was, thinking I would catch up with Luke. Ah, why don't you get a drink in you first? Get you some grub, kick your feet up. - You're with family. - Hmm. Good to see you, man. Cheers. Big Max. [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE, HORN BLARES] [EXHALES DEEPLY] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] [SIGHS] How are you doing? I don't know. This one was, uh... this one was rough. But hey, listen, you have great instincts. This office would gain so much from someone like you. Yeah, I'm gonna be honest with you. Jury's out on whether or not I wanna become a public defender, but, um, today, watching you, I realize that at the very least, I wanna be just like you. Thanks. Thank you. And thank you for all of your help today, really. [SIGHS] I still have some stuff to get done, but you should go. I don't wanna keep you too late. [GROANS] You are killing me. Lopez, look, I'm gonna tell you what we gon' do. We gonna go to a place with alcohol, and we're gonna work thorough this together. You've had a trash day, and you need to start taking care of yourself as much as you take care of your clients, okay? Okay. But hey, don't you have plans with your mystery person? Uh, yeah, uh, rainchecking. This is way more important. But when I get back, we're getting out of this sad government building, okay? [KNOCKS] [CELLPHONE BUZZES] Amy? Hi. I-I'm sorry to turn up like this. I know it's super weird. It's just you know Mark better than anyone, and I've got a problem I don't know how to handle. I know. Rachel told me all about it. Of course she told you. And I already talked Mark through it. [EXHALES DEEPLY] What... What... What did you tell him? I gave him some tough love. Look, I know it might sound crazy, but Mark only kissed Rachel because he is so madly in love with you. Mark did what? Is that... not why you're here? It sure isn't. SAM: Yeah. [LAUGHS] NESS: Nothing more to be said there, but, um... I think, you know... - Hey. - I was just leaving. Sam, how do you feel about hard seltzer? I love alcohol that tastes       - like the faint suggestion of fruit. - [CHUCKLES] Yeah. [LAUGHS] Um... forget the raincheck. Why don't you just join us for drinks? I'd love to. - Oh, okay. - All right. - All right. - All right, all right. NESS: Three is  company. SAM: So where are we going? MAN: Where did it happen? That off of Baja or what? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Hey. I was wondering where you went. - You getting ready to take off? - Yeah, unfortunately. I just got a call that an informant's about to help us close out a case. I get it. You wanted to talk to me about somethin'. Look, I can get somebody to cover for me. No. It can wait. I'll come visit you at the station. MAN: Mind if I bring a couple? - Tomorrow? - Oh, I'd like that. Getting tired of you being a stranger. Be safe. Good night, guys. - Good night. - Good night. Hey, Watkins needs another drink. Actually, I think I'm-a take off, too. Why? 'Cause Daddy's leaving? [LAUGHTER] Come on. You can tell us all about what's cooking in lawyer land. Mm, I'm afraid what happens in that building is a need-to-know only. Well, we sure as hell knew about that protest last year. Quite a few of your friends in the H.O.J. out and about downtown... Didn't see them in any cuffs except that judge. That's because they weren't violating any laws. As a matter of fact, now you were out there kissing one, right? - That's none of your business. - Come on! You can't keep toeing the line. Whose side are you on here? Well, it's hard to say. Is it the side that I've been blindly protecting for years? Or the people who are uncovering the corruption that I've been taught to ignore, huh? They're feeding you lies in there. You know that, right? That cop-hating attorney is trying to pit you against your brothers. Mark Callan is uncovering the truth, and if you refuse to see that, you're more hopeless than I thought. Well, that sounds like traitor talk, Watkins. [GRUNTING] Get off of me! [GRUNTING] ♪♪
