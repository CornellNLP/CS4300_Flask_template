 Previously on "All Rise"  my cellphone. 
 I can show you. 
 - Hey! 
 Hey! 
 - What? 
 No! 
 No! 
 Mr. 
 Aziz's hands are up, backing away,  and there isno weapon. 
 I spent six years inside. 
 You're the one who put me there. 
 This could lead to charges against Deputy Rashel. 
 This could vacate your conviction. 
 You're gonna take down a cop, and you want me to testify? 
 By treating Deputy Rashel the same  as any other alleged felon. 
 Rashel is the first peace officer  to be charged with a felony in almost 10 years. 
 Peter Rashel puts his life at risk every single day. 
 Save it for the trial, Corrine. 
 I work in the field of restorative justice. 
 There's something you should see. 
 Change your life. 
 It could change other people's lives. 
 - Baby's coming home early. 
 - No, no, no, no. 
 We're having a baby! 
 Bailey Carmichael Taylor. 
 You are a gift. 
 You're doing it, babe. 
 - I'm coming! 
 I'm coming! 
 - Where is it? 
 Where is it? 
 - Shh! 
 Shh! 
 - Who put that there? 
 Boy, I'm getting... 
 - Pick up the daggone phone. 
 - Shut up! 
 Lisa. 
 Treasure these moments, Carmichael. 
 What is her happy sound? 
 A coo? 
 A gurgle? 
 Air raid siren. 
 No one said breastfeeding would be stressful. 
 Well, I said those exact words. 
 I resent feeling like a food truck and being bad at it. 
 Aw, it takes time. 
 How are the Three Musketeers? 
 Is that what we're calling them? 
 Apparently they're fine. 
 - Lola! 
 - Okay. 
 The joys of motherhood beckon. 
 - Talk soon? 
 - You know where to find me. 
 Ms. 
 Castillo, you're with me. 
 And so it begins. 
 We're doomed to different courtrooms. 
 Mnh-mnh, Judge Carmichael will not let that happen. 
 And yet I am being dragged away. 
 We'll be here, working... very hard. 
 A few facts before we begin. 
 The initial U.S. 
 use of healing circles  in mainstream criminal justice was in 1996 in Minnesota. 
 It has ancient roots in native and aboriginal cultures. 
 And this process is now being used throughout North America  and other parts of the world. 
 There are many dimensions to the restorative justice process. 
 I mean, this is just one, right? 
 All right, these healing circles provide a space  for encounters between the victim... 
 We call them the harm... and the offender. 
 We call them the harm-doer. 
 But we move beyond that  to evolve the community in the decision-making process. 
 That's you. 
 You have an important responsibility here,  to move beyond the shame and the guilt,  to listen with your hearts,  but to participate in the healing. 
 Darius, this will be quick. 
 Mr. Driscoll will ask you  a few questions about the robbery. 
 The purpose of the prelim is to show the judge  that there's a reason for the trial. 
 Guy stuck a knife in my face. 
 Reason enough? 
 - Without a doubt. 
 - Is he gonna be in there? 
 The defendant Rafael Ibarra? 
 Yes, it's required. 
 Hey, don't ever look at that side of the courtroom. 
 Look at me. 
 All right. 
 Give me a minute. 
 Okay. 
 Court's almost in session. 
 Mr. Watkins, second chair on another one. 
 No, not with Driscoll. 
 He's got me doing all the scut work. 
 Still, it's nice to see you in the courtroom. 
 Speaking of. 
 Rafael, this is serious,  and the judge needs to know that you are taking this seriously. 
 Sit up. 
 But that other kid got caught. 
 Now it's my turn. 
 No one is here to get you. 
 You are accused of robbing Darius with a knife. 
 Hopefully, we can talk about a deal. 
 All rise. 
 You may be seated. 
 The People vs. 
 Rafael Ibarra. 
 Are both sies ready? 
 Yes, Your Honor. 
 Where's our witness? 
 I'll be right back. 
 Hold on. 
 Apologies, Your Honor. 
 Um... 
 Just... 
 Our material witness is unavailable. 
 We ask to trail to last day. 
 Your Honor, the defense is ready,  and we object to any further delay. 
 Your preparation and objection are noted. 
 Gold star. 
 Nonetheless, we'll see everyone in two days. 
 You can't even babysit. 
 Fix it. 
 I'm not supposed to look for witnesses. 
 Not my problem. 
 When is Driscoll gonna make an offer? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I gotta go. 
 We have seen law enforcement vilified,  and we have seen criminals canonized. 
 Omar Aziz is a convict with a grudge  taking advantage of an unfortunate cultural trend. 
 The, facts will show I acted to protect public safety. 
 Deputies are trained to, to assess danger instantly  and protect the innocent. 
 It's not enough that Deputy Rashel shot a man  and then covered it up. 
 Now he posts bail and blames the victim. 
 This is the way the game is played. 
 Mugshots and dress uniforms duel it out on the news. 
 We have to be better. 
 Well... 
 - Callan. 
 - Sam, you have a minute. 
 I seem to be free. 
 Okay. 
 You know, I thought you were asking me out to lunch  or, you know, lunch. 
 Let's do breakfast this weekend. 
 - What's wrong with dinner? 
 - Nothing's wrong with dinner. 
 - Dinner's a fine meal. 
 - Yeah, well, you gotta decide  what kind of meal you wanna have with me. 
 Are we still talking about food? 
 Different meals have different vibes,  and, you know, I... forget it. 
 I thought this was a home address. 
 Hey, Darius. 
 Hey, careful. 
 If he gives you any info,  you become a witness in your own case. 
 Well, that's why I needed backup. 
 The excellent company is an added bonus. 
 Hey, are you okay? 
 Why'd you leave the courthouse? 
 Look, I'm over it. 
 Just do what you're gonna do. 
 Hey, it's much harder to make the case without your testimony. 
 Hey, you have a place to stay? 
 I got my spots. 
 You didn't tell the police that you're unhoused. 
 Look, I got a system. 
 Store my stuff, crash with friends. 
 My look stays tight, and nobody knows my business. 
 - Can we help? 
 - I got a job. 
 I'm frugal. 
 And you know, occasionally dexterous. 
 Okay, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. 
 This is why we don't chase witnesses. 
 Look, the whole thing was humiliating. 
 Nobody even asked what I want to happen. 
 Okay, whoa, what do you want to happen? 
 Look, just forget it. 
 It's not like there are options. 
 It's a question that we should have asked earlier. 
 You're right. 
 Could have asked. 
 You know what? 
 Maybe there's another alternative. 
 Luke, the sentencing for armed robbery is pretty rigid. 
 No, I'm notl'm not talking about the sentencing. 
 What kind of alternative? 
 Let me introduce you to someone. 
 There may be another way to get justice. 
 Patrick, a harm-doer, spent weeks on it. 
 The person he hurt wanted him to learn a skill. 
 By committing a crime against art? 
 She felt Patrick lacked focus and discipline. 
 That was her way of teaching it. 
 So she made him do that. 
 Not made. 
 They worked out a plan together. 
 We call it a reparation agreement. 
 So it's just "Here's your stuff back. 
 Sorry"? 
 Well, in court, there's no incentive  - to take responsibility. 
 - Just by saying, "I'm sorry,"  someone like Rafael could land in prison. 
 But in restorative justice, there's no judge. 
 There's no courtroom. 
 There's only regular folks and a facilitator,  figure out why the harm occurred  and what we can do about it. 
 All you keep talking about is the dude who robbed me. 
 Why am I even here? 
 Tell me what happened. 
 He came at me with a knife. 
 I gave up my gear. 
 - How'd that feel? 
 - How you think? 
 - It pissed me off! 
 - How'd you really feel? 
 Look, I thought I was gonna die. 
 All right? 
 Now I feel like I'm always about to die. 
 You sit down with Rafael and talk,  and then you say what we should do to fix it. 
 I get to say what happens? 
 If you wanna be seen and heard. 
 Darius, it's a good path. 
 Well, I'm not gonna want some dumb art project. 
 We can make this happen. 
 Some courts use restorative justice  in plea deals. 
 The judge in Minnesota? 
 Juvenile court. 
 L.A. County doesn't... 
 This This will be a test case. 
 Darius  do you want me to talk to Rafael? 
 Yeah. 
 Would you even be asking if it weren't me? 
 No. 
 Wow, at least you admit it. 
 No, this isthis is not about our relationship. 
 You're bold. 
 You take chances for your clients. 
 You are setting Rafael up to incriminate himself. 
 Nothing he says will even make it into the D.A.'s file. 
 Only if you put it on the record  that nothing can be used against him. 
 - Absolutely. 
 - Is Driscoll on board? 
 I'll get Driscoll on board. 
 Let's just talk to Rafael,  see if he's open, and I'll work everything else out. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 It was just a whisper. 
 And now my conscience is shouting. 
 It's all wrong. 
 It all has to change. 
 Careful. 
 You might throw out things that work. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm talking about my job. 
 I know. 
 I get it. 
 You told me. 
 You... 
 You're working through a lot. 
 We can really shake things up,  making restorative justice work in the court system. 
 - I'm on the call. 
 - Of course. 
 - One question about the case. 
 - You pull the plug. 
 You got it. 
 I'm trusting you. 
 We're hanging Omar out to dry... again. 
 Journalists don't decide cases. 
 I dragged him into this. 
 I should be protecting him. 
 - What are you doing? 
 - Investigating. 
 Is that the girl's backpack from the protest? 
 Is poop supposed to be this color? 
 Ew. 
 Text the pediatrician if you're worried. 
 - I should let you go. 
 I'm... 
 - I handle what goes in. 
 The childhe can handle what comes out. 
 Best you can do is talk to Omar, tell him what's coming. 
 Warning him isn't going to stop the lies. 
 Nothing will. 
 We're, down to one bottle. 
 Gotta go. 
 Okay. 
 Why'd you dig that up? 
 I'm on leave. 
 Plenty of free time. 
 Lo, I'm serious. 
 What's in the backpack? 
 I didn't do nothing. 
 I just came out of the  store. 
 Keep your hands where I can see 'em. 
 I hold Bailey, and my mind starts racing ahead  to all of the battles that she will face  and what happens when she's the girl with the backpack. 
 I was just coming out of the store. 
 - Where are you going? 
 - I just told you... 
 One bottle. 
 Let me fix that. 
 Rafael, thank you for agreeing to hear me out. 
 What's the offer? 
 Rafael, lean in closer to the mic. 
 No, I'm l'm not here to talk about the case. 
 I wanna get to know you. 
 Prosecutors don't care about tough luck stories. 
 That's her deal. 
 Do you have a tough luck story? 
 Sorry. 
 Daddy didn't beat me. 
 Mom is sober. 
 - Guess I'm just bad. 
 - Mr. 
 Watkins wants to help. 
 I don't really think that that's you, not entirely. 
 - You don't know me. 
 - So help us know you. 
 - What's going on over there? 
 - I'll be fine. 
 What are we talking about? 
 A conversation with Darius about the harm that you... 
 Whoa, hold up. 
 Come on. 
 Allegedly. 
 Are you the kind of man that takes responsibility  for their  I was just getting through to him! 
 Luke, you were walking him straight to a confession! 
 What about PC 2454? 
 You're kidding. 
 On an non-strike felony? 
 And probation. 
 He won't do a day in custody. 
 I bring you felony probation,  and you bring Rafael to the table. 
 I don't think I've ever heard a D.A. say those words. 
 If that's what it takes, I'll make it happen. 
 The real work happens in the restorative dialogue. 
 We just got to get everybody in the same room. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 All right. 
 Cuthbert called. 
 We need to talk. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Why didn't she reach out to me directly? 
 - She knows her audience. 
 - Should I  I'll update you. 
 PC 246.3Negligent discharge of a firearm. 
 Department Rashel is placed on probation. 
 You've got to be kidding me. 
 This is an attempted murder with a gun enhancement. 
 - That's 11 years total. 
 - One has to test the waters. 
 Love, love, love your Boy Scout predictability. 
 If you're not here to discuss a serious plea, I don't even  245... 
 Assault with a semiautomatic,  six years suspended and five years' probation. 
 You rebut the charges. 
 You threaten to drag Omar through the mud,  and now you're ready to plea to a strike? 
 It's time for you to report to the adults. 
 Looking forward to your reply. 
 Bye. 
 I think we should take it. 
 He won't spend a day in prison. 
 The defendant has no record. 
 The incident occurred while on duty. 
 It was clearly out of policy. 
 Obviously, but with a strike,  Rashel cannot work in law enforcement. 
 And he walks free. 
 If we go to trial... 
 - He could be acquitted. 
 - That's a risk. 
 But at least we get a public accounting  of the systemic cover-up that's been happening... 
 While dragging Omar and the office  through a long and difficult trial, which by the way... 
 Are we worried about Omar here,  or are you worried about your police union  campaign contributions? 
 Mr. Callan, we will chalk that up to your zeal for justice. 
 You will not get another chance with me. 
 My apologies. 
 I just  I don't understand why we're going so easy on him. 
 Rashel is admitting fault. 
 It makes me wonder what we're missing. 
 Look, he pleads guilty to a strike, his career is over. 
 How does that fail your definition of justice, Callan? 
 Rashel pulled the trigger,  but others helped him cover it up. 
 He couldn't have done this on his own. 
 If I'm still assigned to this case. 
 I remind us that we have a legal obligation  to run this by Omar. 
 - The Justice League. 
 - Dumbledore's Army. 
 - The Supremes! 
 - Not the Supremes. 
 Whoa! 
 Lola and the Coasters. 
 What is happening? 
 Benner's breaking up the band. 
 Despite my original expectations,  your courtroom and these colleagues  are the reason I come to work. 
 Original expectations? 
 People take advantage of women on maternity leave. 
 We are excellent and coveted by lesser judges. 
 And when bands break up, they never really get back together. 
 No matter how many times Beyoncé teases us  with Destiny's Child Super Bowl reunions. 
 I will talk to Judge Benner, okay? 
 In the meantime,  she took notes on "Not Without Laughter"  by Langston Hughes. 
 Let me know what schools have it on their curriculum. 
 Why, if I may ask? 
 One last wild swing at finding our mystery protestor. 
 I believe she's out there thriving. 
 I hope so. 
 I still snap awake sometimes,  dreaming about that gun. 
 Don't worry. 
 I will talk to Judge Benner. 
 You are the best. 
 We miss you! 
 Thank you, Your Honor. 
 Miss you, too. 
 Send sleep. 
 Thanks. 
 Going to the defendant was unethical. 
 The defense attorney gave permission and was present. 
 You didn't have permission from me! 
 There's a chain of command! 
 We will have an indelible effect  on Rafael's life. 
 I thought it was important to get to know him first. 
 He committed armed robbery, and you want "I'm sorry"? 
 Darius Moore deserves better than that. 
 We represent the people. 
 That's both Darius and Rafael. 
 That's a fairy tale and not in your job description. 
 What kind of job will he get with a strike conviction? 
 - He's only 18! 
 - Priors? 
 None. 
 Two months earlier, and he would have been a juvenile. 
 And getting rehabilitated. 
 You talked to this young man? 
 - He wants to change. 
 - Right. 
 Get the reparation agreement,  and I'm good with a plea to felony assault. 
 See if Judge Benner agrees. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Thank you. 
 If it falls apart, you'll pursue a strike. 
 Don't make me regret this. 
 I am skeptical that putting a victim of violence  in the same room as his attacker would be healing. 
 You put 'em in the same courtroom. 
 To seek justice. 
 And half the time, the victims are mad  that the prison sentences aren't long enough. 
 Yet you're arguing for leniency? 
 No, I'm arguing that the process doesn't always help the victim. 
 Rafael Ibarra is a young man... no priors. 
 If the complaining witness is willing, why shouldn't we? 
 You're both arguing the same side? 
 That's novel. 
 What Mr. Watkins proposes is mutually beneficial. 
 Straight probation on an armed robbery. 
 That gets a judge some unwanted attention. 
 If we want public safety,  we should help defendants like Rafael  truly understand the harm that they cause. 
 I would make that argument to any voter. 
 Your job is not an elected position. 
 Probation keeps Rafael linked to the justice system. 
 It's not a free pass. 
 But I think we can make it better. 
 Traditional probation focuses on punishment. 
 If it's a condition, you risk arrest by... 
 By missing an appointment. 
 Which encourages the discipline necessary for personal reform. 
 So why not use that same framework  to transform through empathy rather than fear? 
 You've piqued my curiosity. 
 - Let's see how this plays out. 
 - Thank you. 
 Don't look so pleased. 
 You still gotta make it work. 
 Judge Benner. 
 Thank you, Your Honor. 
 Impressive back there, Mr. Watkins. 
 I think Judge Benner misses Lola. 
 If your revolution is gonna be this much fun, sign me up. 
 You're having fun? 
 Well, I've always been, you know, kinda  storm the barricades kind of gal. 
 You two look positively ecstatic. 
 Dish. 
 Hello, Ness. 
 I will see you at mediation, all right? 
 Benner just approved a restorative justice dialogue. 
 Benner? 
 - I should buy a lotto ticket. 
 - August Fox will facilitate. 
 August Fox? 
 Former-prosecutor,  blaze-of-glory, turned-reform-warrior August Fox? 
 - The very same. 
 - The man is a genius. 
 - Come on by. 
 - Really? 
 Absolutely. 
 Okay. 
 Carmichael. 
 How's baby-topia? 
 Lisa, please talk to the squad. 
 Is that what we're calling them? 
 My court staff is you're worried you're reassigning them. 
 We are short-staffed everywhere. 
 Lisa, please, for my sanity. 
 I'll let them know to stop bothering you. 
 Carmichael, in the beginning,  everything is tender and fragile, and I mean,  then you drop 'em a few times,  and babies practically bounce. 
 Lisa. 
 Carmichael, you're doing great. 
 I can't wait to get you back here. 
 Yeah. 
 Deputy Rashel's willing to plead  to a 6-year suspended sentence. 
 What happens if we go to trial? 
 We throw everything at him that we could,  and if guilty on all charges, 35 to life. 
 Not guilty, he walks free. 
 He walks free with that plea. 
 With a suspended sentence, if Rashel violates  his probation, that triggers the time. 
 So it's either empty threats or I take a chance  that at trial, he wouldn't even get that? 
 Omar, a trial offers transparency, too. 
 Win or lose, your story is part of the public record... 
 What Rashel did, the officers who helped cover it up. 
 So what do we do? 
 What do you want to happen? 
 I wanna shoot him in the spine and watch him rot. 
 That's... understandable. 
 Not that I can live with that the reality. 
 Look, I-I can't imagine. 
 Six years of actual prison time. 
 Let him lose the same time I did. 
 Even if it means not going to trial? 
 You worry about your fighting the system stuff. 
 I'd just like my eye for an eye, please. 
 I'm proud of you gentlemen. 
 These conversations aren't easy. 
 We won't be talking about the incident, not today. 
 We're gonna talk about life before the crime and after. 
 All right? 
 Rafael, you L.A. born and raised? 
 - You know it. 
 - How was that coming up? 
 You know, nothing special. 
 Just hanging and hustling. 
 Try to keep it interesting, though. 
 What, you robbed me 'cause you were bored? 
 Now let's not go there yet. 
 Darius, where you from? 
 Near Bullis and MLK. 
 Hey, they still have those car sideshows over there? 
 Yeah. 
 One time this, guy spun donuts over fireworks. 
 - Car caught on fire. 
 - Yeah, I think I saw that. 
 Hell, no. 
 You still over there? 
 Well, um... 
 I bounce around. 
 What? 
 Wait, you don't... 
 Okay, Darius, you've had some struggles. 
 What's your day to day now? 
 I don't know. 
 Felt like things would get better. 
 Now I ain't so sure. 
 Hot damn. 
 This better be life or death. 
 How do I convince Bravo to go to trial? 
 If I let Rashel plea,  it's like pretending he's the one bad apple. 
 You wanna expose the rat in the system. 
 - Yeah, I do. 
 - Push Bravo too hard,  and you'll end up reforming from misdemeanor court. 
 I hate when a strategic move feels like the cowardly one. 
 Did you find the cloths? 
 Sorry. 
 I’ll call you back when I have time. 
 - Mark, wait. 
 - Talk later. 
 Bye. 
 I was on a call. 
 Yet somehow, you've been acting like you don't want me around. 
 I wouldn't do this with anybody else. 
 It's just... 
 What? 
 Half the time, I have to help you help me,  and you get to sleep through the night. 
 Okay, I will do more. 
 If you wanna wake me up, just drop an elbow on me. 
 So you can do what, tell me the baby is hungry? 
 Well, if there is extra,  I will warm a bottle from the fridge. 
 Extra? 
 I'm gonna put these up by the rocker. 
 I've done little stuff before. 
 I snatched something,  and crimeys would be all like, "". 
 - "Crimey"? 
 - Your boy you do crime with. 
 See? 
 He's down. 
 Never caught, though. 
 Jail is, um  a lot. 
 Say more about that. 
 "Sleep with one eye open" ain't just something they say. 
 Yeah, that's why I don't do shelters. 
 There are a lot of places out there  that are good with youth safety. 
 I can get you a rec. 
 And I'm just, like,  laying up there at night, you know, thinking,  man, all this over some dumb knockoff, you know? 
 Yo, what you say? 
 All right, take a breath. 
 What, I'm supposed to feel sorry for you  'cause my stuff is cheap?! 
 No, I'm saying if I had known, I would have... 
 Well, what's up?! 
 Come on! 
 Try me now! 
 Come on, man. 
 Try me now! 
 I'm saying it like a compliment. 
 - Hey, you're not helping! 
 - Take a breath. 
 - Let's take a break. 
 - No, you said I'd be in charge! 
 - Darius, come on, let's... 
 - No, forget it! 
 - Darius. 
 - I'm done! 
 Y'all can lock him up, man. 
 I'm done. 
 Darius! 
 A setback like this isn't ideal, but not unheard of, given time. 
 We don't have time. 
 Rafael's plea is contingent upon a reparation agreement. 
 You brought Rafael to participate? 
 
 
 
 I thought once they met... 
 If this does not work, he is facing a strike. 
 What are you gonna do about that? 
 I'll talk to Choi. 
 I thought you had this. 
 I get it. 
 You're in a rush to the revolution. 
 My boss, the judge, they understand probation. 
 I thought if I could get them  to look at the reparation agreement  in the same way, I could make them understand. 
 But the master's tools aren't much use  against the master's house. 
 I don't know how to get this type of justice to work  inside the court system, but it has to. 
 That corner you're in right now  is why I stopped being a prosecutor. 
 Wow. 
 Exit line. 
 - Not helpful. 
 - Figure it out. 
 I better. 
 I like where you started on assault with a semi-automatic,  but we're not walking outta here without actual prison time. 
 Tell you what. 
 We'll move to high term  assault with a semi-automatic,  nine years, suspended. 
 He doesn't serve a day in custody. 
 I prefer my chances with a jury. 
 Love, love, love the full-court press. 
 PC 245. 
 Assault with a semi-automatic,  low term of three, actual prison time. 
 That's a start. 
 Is this the kind of radical, progressive organization  you're running now? 
 We don't play politics here, Corinne. 
 Guilty plea plus prison time. 
 What more could you gain? 
 Let me confer with Mr. Callan,  but I believe we have found a solution. 
 Mr. Rashel, one question. 
 Why not fight this tooth and nail  like every other officer? 
 Don't answer that. 
 Are you a religious man, Mr. Callan? 
 It's been a minute since I've seen the inside of a church,  but yeah. 
 I always knew that a reckoning was coming. 
 Then why not step forward years ago? 
 Well, I didn't say I wanted that reckoning. 
 But I made a terrible mistake,  and I chose to hide it. 
 Say that in open court, it might do us all some good. 
 Don't be fooled by Delgado's quiet wit. 
 She is a bulldog. 
 And sure, Campbell looks all rumply and cute,  but he has the instincts of a killer. 
 I have a 15-point plan  on how to keep the judges from poaching us. 
 15 entire points? 
 There are also sub points. 
 Point one... always be Coastering. 
 What now? 
 If someone asks for your assistance,  you are always in the midst  of a complicated Lola-coaster request. 
 Good. 
 You're not busy. 
 Actually, Loa requested a detailed precedent rundown  of all decisions related to Franklin hearings  and the rate at which parole is granted to youthful offenders. 
 Good luck with that. 
 Castillo, we take a plea tomorrow. 
 Kansky, you're with me. 
 I have a docket dilemma. 
 She is picking us off one by one. 
 - Not a horror movie. 
 - Isn't it? 
 Luther Vandross you are not. 
 She likes it. 
 Babe, I'm sorry. 
 Okay, so  I've been sniping at you because I'm already worried  about you leaving, you back at work,  me here alone. 
 Well, we have weeks. 
 And good thing,  because I just realized this morning  that this little one is not a house guest. 
 She's not leaving. 
 No, she's not. 
 Bailey came early,  and we didn't have time  to get ready the nest, not really. 
 When I'm up feeding Bailey in the middle of the night,  I know that you're in the next room. 
 But soon you'll be in D.C.,  and I'll just have to do my best,  and what if my best isn't good enough? 
 What if I am not... 
 Babe, of course you are. 
 You got this. 
 Yeah. 
 I didn't see how hurt Darius was, the trauma. 
 He seemed so resilient. 
 I can't. 
 I just... 
 Let hope override reality. 
 What's going on with you? 
 I studied law to help people. 
 But that's a moving target, and it keeps moving faster. 
 Have a seat. 
 When I was Grade One eons ago,  some of the guys started this running joke. 
 Every time I was assigned a case with an Asian defendant... 
 Did they "your people" you? 
 "Hey, Choi, go easy on your uncle. 
 Hey, Choi, is that your cousin?"  Korean, Chinese, didn't matter to 'em. 
 - Comedians. 
 - Laugh riot. 
 That's why I avoided when I could. 
 Skip the files with Asian names. 
 Then I get a trial hand off last minute. 
 Walk in and there is this Filipino kid. 
 Actually your people? 
 20 years old, maybe. 
 He was relieved to see me. 
 I'm the prosecutor, and he's relieved. 
 Right, because we have a responsibility. 
 I put that guy away for 10 years. 
 Offer the felony probation. 
 Thank you. 
 Now Rafael gets a second chance. 
 What does Darius Moore get? 
 Mr. Watkins, your argument for this lenient plea  included a public safety outcome... 
 Yes. 
 Based on the rapprochement of these two men. 
 Teenagers, Your Honor. 
 Teenagers. 
 And my client participated in good faith. 
 He. 
 Ms. Lopez. 
 Hey, could I say something? 
 Go ahead. 
 Okay. 
 I thought everyone in here was out to get me. 
 But he wasn't. 
 And you weren't. 
 And I hope you're not wrong about that. 
 And if Darius was here,  I'd tell him... 
 I don't know. 
 I know "sorry" don't cover it. 
 Mr. 
 Watkins. 
 You gave me a lot to think about. 
 However, you did not secure the reparation agreement  that you promised. 
 Without it, I worry that this plea meets neither  the goal of rehabilitation nor of punishment. 
 Mr. Ibarra should not be punished for the reluctance  of the complaining witness. 
 But Mr. Ibarra should be held accountable  for what he has done. 
 You have shifted my thinking on that accountability. 
 I will be comfortable with the plea to strike for probation  or non-strike PC 245 with time in custody. 
 You'll let me know what you come to. 
 And there it is. 
 Welcome to the real world, kid. 
 Deputy Rashel, did anyone force you  into accepting this settlement? 
 No. 
 Do you wanna say anything to the court  before we enter the order? 
 No. 
 Thank you, though. 
 Then that will be the order. 
 Hands behind your back. 
 We decided that the best option was guaranteed prison time. 
 I know it's short of the six years, but... 
 Better than nothing? 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 You could still pursue civil action if that's... 
 Tell me, Mr. Callan,  when will you atone for your part in this? 
 I'm sorry, Omar. 
 I... 
 I screwed up. 
 If I was handed this case today, I... 
 You rubber-stamped the injustice,  but now you're playing the hero. 
 I was just trying to right a wrong. 
 I'd say you got a long way to go. 
 Nice work, Callan. 
 Your game of "plea chicken" really paid off. 
 First of all, that is a terrible phrase  that should die a flaming death,  and second of all, I wasn't playing. 
 Well, you did better than many have before us. 
 Sir, I'm not satisfied with incremental gains. 
 I'd like to discuss where Special Trials goes next. 
 Okay, that "win an inch, steal a mile" attitude  might work with Choi,  but I decide the priorities for our divisions. 
 A win? 
 Sir, Deputy Rashel got a better deal  than any civilian ever would. 
 We serve the People,  and we are doing an uneven job of it at best. 
 I have some excellent cases lined up for you, Mark. 
 Very big, very exciting. 
 You should just have fun with that. 
 Sir, I don't do this for fun. 
 Well, you should while you still can. 
 We didn't make any friends in law enforcement today,  but when the consequences of that come rolling around  however they roll around, the time for fun will be over. 
 It's in there. 
 You know, I'll do another run. 
 Damn. 
 Hey, I wanted to apologize. 
 Okay. 
 I need to be held accountable for what I put you through. 
 You're in a hurry. 
 First, you want me to forgive Rafael. 
 Now you pressing me to let you slide. 
 Okay, I'm not trying to... 
 Look, I'm angry, okay? 
 And I'm gonna be angry  for a good, long time. 
 August said that. 
 The first time I observed a sentencing circle,  someone wanted to know, "How do I forgive?"  August asked first. 
 Have you been angry long enough? 
 I respect that. 
 August says there's some work down at the Senate. 
 - Yeah, I got a job. 
 - Well, maybe if you need two,  I thought maybe you could talk to some people  about what you've been going through. 
 Like a guru. 
 More like a mentor. 
 I'll think on it. 
 If you ever decide you've been angry long enough,  I'm at the D.A.'s office. 
 I was having the most wonderful dream. 
 I was sleeping. 
 What's this? 
 Dionn Richardson. 
 That's the name of the young woman  who owns that stray backpack. 
 How  I had a friend go digging for theft reports  filed against the police. 
 Smart. 
 You took a walk in her shoes. 
 Even if she doesn't back down from a fight,  the desk sergeant that filled out that report,  he just sat on it. 
 It's lucky my guy found it. 
 - Thank you. 
 - You're welcome. 
 Baby, I... 
 I'm good at this. 
 I promise you that I will get better at the other. 
 And I'll always help. 
 Still got love for you, girl. 
 Dionn, you are a tough young woman to find. 
 Well, I try to stay off the grid. 
 But wow. 
 - Thank you for saving me. 
 - You're welcome. 
 You know, you're kind of a bad ass. 
 You're one to talk. 
 What happened? 
 By the time I was released, you were gone. 
 I kept asking, am I free to go? 
 And when they said yes, I ran,  didn't realize I had left my bag. 
 - I'll send it to you. 
 - Thanks. 
 So... 
 why were you out protesting? 
 Just to bring attention to an oppressive institution  with roots in fugitive slave capture. 
 Wow. 
 You are a smart young lady. 
 There are plenty of folks who share that critique  but ignore the call. 
 Well, I figure no one else is gonna fix it for me. 
 - You're a mom? 
 - Brand-new. 
 Congrats. 
 Hope you don't have to step in front  of any more guns. 
 Yeah, that makes two of us. 
 Do you have someone that you can talk to  about what happened? 
 Yeah, my mom, told me about her protest days,  and said it was okay I was afraid. 
 She's kind of a bad ass, too. 
 Like mother, like daughter, then. 
 I guess I am. 
 We have a plan. 
 I called in a favor with the assistant network  and did some deft docket trading. 
 I'll assist Judge Carmichael  in reviewing sentencing alternatives. 
 I'll be compiling cases  in which a court reporter's understanding of slang  affected case outcomes. 
 In short, there is no reason  to farm us out to other courtrooms. 
 Very ambitious. 
 I certainly hope Judge Laski allows you the time  for the extra work. 
 Judge Laski? 
 I was never planning on reassigning you. 
 Jonas is being displaced by renovations to his chambers. 
 He'll just move to 802. 
 Problem solved. 
 I was so close, Em,  to really making a difference. 
 I didn't wanna wait for slow evolution. 
 I was almost the meteor. 
 Sushi burrito truck is back. 
 - Let me buy you something. 
 - You know what hurts the most? 
 Failing in front of you. 
 Luke... 
 When I said everything needed to change... 
 Look, it makes sense. 
 If you wanna transform your life,  you can't be weighed down. 
 You never weighed me down. 
 You never weighed me down. 
 What... 
 What happened? 
 One minute, you were figuring things out on your own,  and then... 
 Wanted to see myself in a new way. 
 And Sam helped with that? 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 It's not a healthy approach. 
 I know. 
 How's Joaquin? 
 He's still out of town. 
 I've been so busy with our case,  we haven't really caught up, but... 
 good, I'm sure. 
 Thank you for the dinner invite. 
 Rain check? 
 Of course. 
 It was good working with you, Mr. Watkins. 
 You will make it happen. 
 Next time. 
 Yeah. 
 Sweet, blissful quiet. 
 I'm gonna nap for a year. 
 Thank you for finding Dionn. 
 You're welcome. 
 I didn't realize how afraid I'd gotten, having Bailey. 
 Obviously, I'm not gonna risk my life. 
 Better not. 
 What other fights will I start backing down from? 
 Will I play it safe on the bench? 
 Bailey may have you worrying that you're not enough. 
 But stepping in to help Dionn  Lola Carmichael, that is not the exception. 
 That is the rule. 
 Baby, you are a warrior. 
 Bailey will be, too. 
 Dionn did call me a bad ass. 
 Hello, Mark. 
 Hey, Lo. 
 So... 
 turns out  some mistakes can't be fixed. 
 Omar called me out  as being part of the problem. 
 I don't... wanna be part of the problem. 
 Righteous motivation. 
 That's the rocket fuel, right? 
 How's the family? 
 Hey, Robin! 
 What's up, man? 
 - Shh! 
 - Ooh, ooh, ooh. 
 Sorry. 
 Sorry, sorry. 
 I'm gonna go clean up. 
 - Okay. 
 Love you. 
 - I love you. 
 Hey, can I, say good night to the baby? 
 Quietly. 
 Hey, sweetie. 
 All right, um, once upon a time,  there was a judge named Lulu. 
 Lulu? 
 And what are you called, Quark? 
 And Quark and Lulu  were members of an intergalactic legal team. 
 Their mission was to scour the universe,  helping people rebuild trusts that had been broken. 
 Very nice. 
 And though their work was very hard,  and though Quark was impossibly handsome... 
 God. 
 They always discovered something wonderful.
