 Hey, okay, Mom, um, Chale just got off the phone with his parents. 
 Oh, please tell me June 17th works for the wedding. 
 Luckily, my mother had to pull out of her archery tournament. 
 She refuses to wear her new glasses, and last month, she killed a dairy cow. 
 S-So...? 
 So, what Chale is trying to say is, we're good. 
 The 17th is on. 
 Okay, great! 
 So, we got... we got parents, we got deejay, we got reception hall. 
 Yeah, not only does that date work, it's the only date that  does  work. 
 Hey, honey, um, looks like June 17th for the wedding, so let's talk to Father Philip about reserving the church. 
 Hold up. The 17th? 
 Nobody checked with me. 
 My dance card is pretty full. Hold on. 
 Yeah, no go. 
 Mets are playing the Padres, and I'm probably going with the boys. 
 You'd choose a Met game over your daughter's wedding? 
 You think I would really do that? 
 You're my little peanut, and I love you. 
 Come on. 
 You just realized it's an away game, didn't you? 
 I did. They're in San Diego. 
 ♪ I am not your ordinary guy ♪ 
 Mass is really packed. 
 I-I... It's gonna be tough finding a spot. 
 Yeah, well, that's why I said we should have left earlier. 
 Ooh, ooh! Family getting in an SUV right there. 
 Yeah, exactly... It's a family, Donna. 
 That's three kids you got to get buckled in, hand out juice boxes before you even start the car. 
 It's a whole ordeal. 
 Oh, oh! Dad, look. 
 11:00... single male headed towards his Corolla. 
 Yep. I'm on it. 
 That guy? He's on his phone. 
 Yeah. He's got pep in his step. 
 He's got things going on. I like it. 
 He's already in his car. 
 Ah! I think you're making a mistake. 
 Kids are already in their seats. They have their juice. 
 Yeah, that family's pulling out any second. 
 Are you kidding me? He's adjusting the mirrors. 
 Oh, come... It's a straight backup, guy! Yes. 
 Car's about to pull out. 
 You already got it in reverse! 
 Take your foot off the brake, idiot! 
 Church parking lot, Dad. 
 Yep. Gotcha. 
 The space is open. Go, go, go! 
 All right. 
 [Engine revs] 
 [Tires screech] 
 Oh, man! 
 Aah! Old lady. 
 Really, Mrs. Dooley?! 
 With your big calves. 
 Hustle! 
 [Horn honks] 
 Did you see that? He pulled in right in front of me! 
 That was my spot! That son of a... 
 Church, Dad! Yep. Gotcha. 
 Don't we know that guy? 
 That's Terry Labasco. 
 Who's Terry Tabasco? 
 Labasco. He's this guy your dad hates from high school. 
 I don't hate him, okay? I don't hate  anybody. 
 Hey, we don't use that word "hate" in this family. 
 K-Gable! Hey, Meatball! 
 Were you waiting for that spot? 
 Did you beep? 
 I can't hear a thing in my Benz. 
 With those Bose speakers playing, it sounds like Tony Bennett's in the back seat. 
 [Both laugh] 
 It's fine. I-I'll just find another place to park. 
 Okay. If I was you, I'd park it at Dunkin' Donuts. 
 That way, you can kill a couple of birds with one stone. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Man, I hate that guy. 
 ♪ 
 All right, now, your mother and I got to talk to Father Philip, so, uh, why don't you go find some seats, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Terry! I hear Bridget's engaged! 
 Congratulations! 
 Thank you, Father. 
 We are so excited. 
 Um, we'd like to reserve the church for June 17th. 
 I'm sorry... June 17th? 
 Yeah, um, 'cause that actually was the date that we wanted to reserve for Kendra's wedding, so... 
 Well, you know, we call this in theology "awkward." 
 Well, Father, I did kind of ask first. 
 Wait... But I... But I waved, and I kind of wiggled my fingers, which is sign language for "We need to talk," so... 
 Um, I've got a ton of deaf friends. 
 Pretty sure that's not true. 
 Okay, look, you stole my parking spot. 
 You're not stealing our wedding date, okay? 
 I didn't take your spot, Gable. 
 I just didn't want to be late for Mass, like some families are. 
 Okay. I was waiting for Mrs. Dooley. 
 I try every day to put others before me... 
 Mostly because of your teachings, Father. 
 Thank you, Kevin, but, guys, this is not a competition. 
 Of course not. 
 No! 
 It's just that the thing is, our son-in-law's parents, they are traveling from England, and so it's really the only date that works for all of us. 
 I got peeps coming from Wichita. 
 Wichita. 
 I could ride a bike from Wichita, okay? 
 Enough with the eyes, okay? I get it. 
 The bottom line is, I cannot budge on the date. 
 Well, neither can we. 
 But... 
 Well, then, we've got ourselves a situation, pork chop. 
 Well, then, maybe we do, because, listen to me... 
 Well, well... 
 Guys, guys, guys, please. Let me think about this. 
 I'm running on two hours' sleep. 
 Sister Mary polished off the Red Bull. 
 I will get back to you. 
 Absolutely. Thank you, Father. 
 God bless. Thank you, Father. 
 Thank you. 
 Y-yes. God bless you, Father. 
 God bless you all. And everybody here at Saint Rocco's. 
 Everybody. Blessings, blessings. Blessings. 
 ♪ 
 Congratulations to Father Benedict, who crushed in the dance competition at the parish picnic. 
 Pfft! Robot. Who knew? 
 Unfortunately, he did shatter his knee, so, bottom line, he's not gonna be able to host this Saturday's pancake breakfast. 
 So if I can get someone to fill in, I'd really owe them. 
 Sign-up sheet for that is on the bulletin board in the hallway. 
 It's also time for our annual mission trip. 
 [Suspenseful music plays] 
 If you've never been a part of this, I'm telling you, it's a life-changing event. 
 This year, we will be heading to Guatemala to help the people there. 
 We're roughing it. 
 Hey, hey! 
 No, no, no, no, no! 
 You looking for this? 
 Well, you ain't got a shot at getting that date. 
 You know why? 'Cause once Father Philip sees me... teach breastfeeding to first-time mothers? 
 Oh. Meatball, you grabbed the wrong one. 
 Now while you're busy taking off your blouse, I'll be flipping and dishing out pancakes all the way to my kid's wedding. 
 Sweet. 
 ♪ 
 Hey, baby. I made you lunch. 
 Whoa. Nice tool belt. 
 Is that the last belt you got that fits? 
 [Stammers mockingly] 
 Just doing a little volunteering down at the church. 
 From time to time, I like to give back. 
 [Chuckles] Since when? 
 Ah, it's been, what, uh, got to be three days, huh, hon? 
 Since we've been trying to lock down the date for your wedding. 
 Wait... "trying"? Is there a problem? 
 We didn't want to tell you, but the Labascos kind of want the same date for their daughter's... 
 [Babbles] 
 We're gonna get you the date, all right? 
 And you know why? 
 'Cause good things happen to good people, and we... We're good people. 
 Exactly. 
 Now, if Terry Labasco tries any crap today, you take him down. 
 Oh, he's going down "good people" style. 
 Dad, the Gables have assured me June 17th, so, uh, we can lock you in. 
 Well, consider me locked, then. 
 Uh-oh! 
 What is that I feel behind me? 
 Hello, Chalie-puss! [Chuckles] Hello, Mums. Hi, guys! [Giggles] Oh. Hello, Kendra. Hello. I see you're in your waitress uniform. Uh... Okay, uh, I'll let you guys go, and, uh, I'll see you on the 17th. Bye-bye, Chalie-puss! [Smooches] Bye, guys! I can't wait to see... you. [Chuckles] You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd say your parents aren't crazy about me. Hey, that's not true! Okay, maybe they're not 100% sold on you. Sold on me? Well, you're the one doing the selling. I mean, what are you telling them? Well, I've been hitting the law-school thing pretty hard, but they really locked in on the pizza-waitress thing. Oh, and the short temper. Short temper?! Yeah, that one. So it's true... They don't like me. Well, look, at least  my  parents are in England, so we just tap a button and they go away. What's that supposed to mean? Just that  you  have to suffer a Skype for 30 seconds, and  I  have had to suffer for a year. [Scoffs] Like it's been that bad. What?! With your father? [As Kevin] "Oh, uh, guy, guy! That's the good bologna." Yeah, don't touch it. Guy, if that's the last ice cream sandwich, "I'm gonna end your life." [Normal voice] He threatened to kill me over ice cream. Is it really that hard to take? They let you live here for  free. Oh, great. Thank you for reminding me. No one's said that to me in, like, over 12 minutes. All right, you know what? I got to go to work. I just came in here to kiss you goodbye. Oh, great. Well, let's tick that off your to-do list. Fine! Mmm! Oh, fireworks! Yeah, right back at you, Chalie-puss. ♪ Oh, hey, Father Philip. Dimmer switch is installed. Oh, a little late-night Bible reading, but you don't have enough light? You just kick it up a notch. Oh... Some older nuns visiting, not quite the lookers they once were. You bring it down. Very nice, Kevin. Thank you. Uh, Father, I noticed that the door was creaking, so I replaced the hinges, and you know what they sound like now? That. Father, I put up those pictures right there, so I just want you to know that. Did you use a level, Kevin? They look a little crooked. Maybe it's me. No, it's you. They're perfect. All right, guys, listen... The church appreciates all the work that you've done, but I think maybe it's time we call it a day. Absolutely, Father. I agree. I agree. Although, Father, I did notice a few marks on the floor. I could buff those out in the blink of an eyeball. Really not necessary. 
 
 [Rock music plays] Hey, Gable! That's a cute little machine you got there. My grandma's got one just like it. They let her use one of these in prison? Yeah, you know what, Labasco? You're not winning this thing.  I  am. Why don't you do yourself and that poor machine a favor? Unsaddle, go home, pick another wedding date. Not happening. Here's something you don't know about me. What, your cholesterol's under 550? No... I never give up! Rrrrrrrr!! [Grunting] Hey! Hey! Hey! What is going on? Gable's out of control, Father. He's been... No, I-I was just cleaning the floors. Just be more careful. I have a lot on my plate today. Sister Connie's sick, and I have no one to teach her Catechism class. Oh, I think you do. ♪ I am Mr. Gable, and I will be filling in for Sister Connie, who's a little bit under the weather. Is Sister going to die? What? Oh. No, no, no, no, no. I mean, I guess  someday,  she's gonna die. I mean, we're  all  gonna die someday, right? We're gonna die? Uh, you know what? Let's switch it up. Everybody stand up. We're gonna stretch it out. Let's stretch things out... Let's get the arms going, get some blood flowing. Now let's go the other way, circles back the other way. This is weird. No, no, no. This is Catechism. Aren't we supposed to be learning about religion? Okay, fine. Everybody sit down. Okay, let's... Let's talk about religion. Uh... What do you want to know? Is God real? 'Cause my uncle says he's not. Of course God's real. How do you know? Well, um... Okay. ♪ 1986... The Mets are one out away from losing the World Series to the Boston Red Sox. Mookie Wilson hits an easy ground ball towards first base that will end it all. Across town, a wiry 16-year-old from Massapequa says a prayer, and God heard me. 'Cause He opened the legs of the great Bill Buckner, that ball rolled through, and the Mets won the Series. Um, didn't people also pray for the Red Sox to win? Mm, apparently, not hard enough, right? [Chuckles] Kevin? Oh. I was kind of hoping you'd stick to the source material. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, I hit them with a little straight talk, and then I get to this stuff. Actually, Father, if you don't mind, uh... Kids, we know that God exists, because, well, He  is  existence. He's in every single one of us. He's in our heart, He's in our minds, His beauty's in the sun that rises, and the moon that gives off that perfect night light. The fact that we exist is proof positive that God Himself exists. [Groans] Actually, that is spot-on. [Applause] Oh, no, no. No, no. That a-and... And the Mets. The sun, the moon, and the Mets. It's all spot-on. Spot-on. ♪ Hey. We need to up our game. What? Labasco... He's leaving us in the dust. I can't stand the guy! Okay, all right. Relax, because I'm way ahead of you. There is a big fundraising dinner at the church. I'm gonna make a pan of my famous teriyaki chicken. Hmm? Oof. What? Well, it's mostly famous for me not being able to go to work the next day. Uh, what should I make, then? Two words... lasagna. Okay. [Snaps fingers] That's  one  word. No, it's Italian. "La zagna"... "the zagna." [Door opens] Hey, guys. Hey. Um, okay, so, I-I know that you guys have been trying really hard to get that wedding date... Yeah, and we're gonna get it for you. You're good. Yeah, well, we were actually thinking, you know, maybe it'd be better to push it back a bit. What's... the matter? Well, it turns out Chale and I still have a lot to talk about. Y-Yes, this morning, we discovered we have some issues festering beneath the surface. Okay, well, you're getting married on the 17th, so slap a Band-Aid on your issues, okay? 'Cause there's no way Terry Labasco is winning this one. ♪ Hey. That's  my  spot. What, are you trying to take my job? [Laughs] That's a good one, Father. No, no, no, I... I-I heard you saying how run-down the confessional was getting, so I just... I just wanted to fix the hinge, and I replaced the ripped cushion with a new one. W-Why don't you give it a try? All right. Oh, wow! This is a sweet ride! Huh? Yeah. Thank you, Kevin. Don't thank  me. Thank the Lord. He's the one guiding me. [Groans] Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been three weeks since my last confession. Oh, uh, no, no. I'm n... I have been very unkind to a fellow parishioner. It goes back to grade school. Who knew that Kevin Gable would turn out to be a good guy? Go on. Back in the day, I was so jealous of him. He was so funny. He was a... He was a large boy. Everybody loves the large boy, you know? And now I'm just acting like a jerk all over again, because we want the same stupid wedding date. And I know, Father, I should be charitable and just let him have it. But... you know, it just comes back to my heart issues, my... my... my... My ticker. My cardiologist wants to try the baboon heart. It's not gonna match. They  never  match. [Voice breaking] I just want to last long enough to see my little girl get married. You know? ♪ [Sighs] Hey. Hey! Introducing Donna Gable's... [Italian accent] authentic Italian lasagna! [Normal voice] Heads-up... I may have lost an earring in that one. Yeah, we got to give, uh, Terry Labasco the date. What? Trust me, it means a lot more to him than it does to us. What happened? [Exhales sharply] I learned some stuff today... Some personal stuff. He... has a heart condition. Really? Are you sure? I'm sure. He was in my confessional today. What? [Sighs] He thought I was a priest. Look, if I walk you through it, you'd realize it's not a big deal. So... he's really sick? Yeah, he might not even make it to his daughter's wedding. Oh, man. Yeah. Oh, that's really sad. It makes you think about stuff. And this was a big, fat waste of time! What are we gonna do with all this lasagna? I'll take care of it for you. No. It's going to the church. Absolutely. All right, I will just load them in the car. Not a chance. Hey. Guys. Um, okay, so, we just wanted to apologize. Yes. You were right, Mr. Gable. We were being very silly. Yeah, and we talked, and we realized just how much we love each other. So we are good to go on the 17th! Yeah, it's not gonna happen. She'll fill you in on the deets. ♪ You're not gonna usher your way to that date, pal. Terry, you can have the date, okay? What? I already talked to Father Philip. It's yours. Wow. Yeah, and you know what? Enjoy the day, and... Actually, enjoy  every  day. Thanks. My... My little girl... She's just gonna be so hap... happy. Yeah. [Organ playing] Linda. Hey. I wanted to let you know that Kevin and I decided to give you guys the date. Thank you. Yeah, and... and please know that I'm here for you. O-Okay. Also, I'm a nurse, so if you need anything or you want any referrals, please reach out to me, okay? What are you talking about? [Clicks tongue] Terry's heart condition. Okay. Thank you. Oh, there you go. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. You know my situation. Why would you do this to me? He's lying. He doesn't have a heart condition. He played you. He confessed. No, he knew it was you. I just talked to his wife. I lit a candle for him! Hey, Labasco, how you feeling? What are you talking about? I know you're not dying. Oh, yeah? Who said I was? "Father Kevin"? Well, you know what? You can kiss that date goodbye. Oh, no. No. It's mine. Never. Mine. [Sighs deeply] [Dramatic music plays] [Both grunting] [Music stops] Father. [Music, grunting resume] I was just trying to do something nice for my daughter, and... well, it got away from me. Mm-hmm. Of course, you know about the stick fight outside the church. That's probably why neither family is getting the 17th. Mm-hmm. Is that a done deal, by the way? Yes. Yeah. Is that all? Yes. All right. No. About an hour ago, I sat in a handicapped parking spot and ate an entire tray of lasagna that I promised my wife I would give to the church. So... there's nothing left? There may be a corner. There isn't. ♪
