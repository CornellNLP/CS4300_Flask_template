 Hey, Potter! 
 I scored us a buck! Half of it’s for you! 
 Don’t come any closer, Jed. 
 Jenny’s got it… the “red flu.” 
 Stumbled over a body by Canyon Creek. 
 She didn’t see the “X.” 
 I'm not gonna let you starve! 
 I'm leaving you the buck! 
 [Spray can rattling, lid pops] 
 [Thud] 
 [Sighs] 
 Grandpa, what'd you get? 
 Game was a little scarce today, kiddo. 
 Plainview is a full day's hike, but a total score. 
 Fully stocked and completely deserted. 
 Oh, I love these! 
 Let's put everything away in the pantry. 
 Perishables in front, canned goods in back. 
 And those are for breakfast. 
 You shouldn't be going so far out there by yourself. 
 I think I saw an electronics store there. 
 I could go back tomorrow and get you that part you need. 
 What is it, a vacuum tube? 
 You're not going. 
 It's our only chance of getting ahold of Tom. 
 He's your son. 
 If anyone can survive, it's him. 
 It's a capacitor, not a vacuum tube. 
 And bring a weapon. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Jeter : The ceremony will be at 0900. 
 We'll have seven gunners and the ensigns at half-mast. 
 It'll be a hero's farewell. 
 He wanted to redeem himself. 
 He never had to. 
 He gave his life for mine. 
 He gave his life for the mission. 
 And now we're free... 
 To finish it. 
 [Whir, hiss] 
 Congratulations, little guy. Your job here's done. 
 Rachel : I could actually do with some help with these boxes. 
 You can set them up over there. Thank you. 
 At your service. 
 Little more room between those cots, please. 
 So, uh... the peeps are asking. 
 What's this whole Human guinea pig thing gonna look like? 
 I mean, basically, you infect the crew with the virus, you see what happens? 
 Well, not the entire crew. 
 Six individuals of varying blood and genetic markers. 
 First we administer the vaccine prototype, then we inject each of them with the virus. 
 Ah, gotta tell you... 
 I don't know if people are gonna be lining up for that. 
 Well, that's not my department. 
 [Clattering] 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 Mason : This is the last one we recorded. 
 [Click, radio static] 
 Dominic : Hello? Is anyone listening? 
 My name is Dominic. 
 We're stranded on a boat west of the island of Jamaica. 
 There are 50 of us. 
 Many are sick. We need help. Turn it off. Anyone. Please. [Click] I thought I wanted to hear his voice again, but not like that. It must have been so hard listening to all of that suffering. Are you sure that you want to be there? To watch the trials? It'll be part of my blood flowing through those people. I have to see if it's going to work. [Clangs] Ready... [Rifles cock] Aim... Fire! [Gunshots] Ready... [Rifles cock] Aim... Fire! [Gunshots] [Rifles cock] Fire! [Gunshots] [Splash] Chandler : How are we gonna ask them to do this? We don't have the time or resources to recruit from anywhere else. I know, but six people? She doesn't have the equipment to sustain a quarantine for more than a few days, which is just enough time for one trial with as many people as she can fit into that lab. Well, then I have to volunteer. We just risked everything to save your sorry ass so that you could lead. What kind of message does that send? You got rank, you can sit it out? Everyone else can be the Guinea pigs? Captain's right. Someone from a leadership position needs to volunteer to set an example... Which is why I already had Dr. Scott do a work-up on me. Apparently I check off a few of the boxes she needs... African-American, male over 40... Southern baptist. Master Chief. With all due respect, gentlemen, it's already been done. And you don't even know if you qualify. The crew needs you, in some ways, more than either one of us. I appreciate the sentiment, sir, but you both know we're all needed. And we're all dispensable. All right, spread the word we need volunteers. Let the crew know it'll be completely confidential. I don't want anyone feeling pressured. Aye, sir. Told you God put me here for a reason. Maybe this is it. Let's just line 'em up over here. Thanks. Kelly : Hello, captain. You seem to be settling in well. Well, I thought I'd make myself useful. How's Ava? She's doing okay. Thank you. Man : I need two chairs around these tables and the medical questionnaires. I... I haven't had the opportunity to thank you for what you did for my family... After what I did to you. Commander Slattery said you were very helpful while I was on vacation. Still... I don't deserve what you did. Let's finish what we started. [Chittering] Any history of serious injuries? No, sir. Never even broken a bone. Any flu-like symptoms? Aches or pains? Just aching to do my part. [Indistinct conversations] I never expected this many. Do you really think you qualify to volunteer when you barely survived dengue fever last week? You're not even gonna test my blood? [Door opens] Danny. Tex : Hey! I'm looking for the Copacabana. Anyone point me in the right direction? Harvest queen 2008? You never told me you were royalty. [Chuckles] Dr. Scott says we might be in there a few days, so we should grab anything important. I think she wants us to have something sentimental in case it goes south. You're gonna introduce me to her one day. Thank you. For not trying to talk me out of this. Mm. Rachel : So you've just received what we're calling the prototype decoy. It will, uh, bind to the virus and keep it occupied while your system creates the antibodies that it needs to defeat it. I will remind you that you will likely experience some side effects similar to the early stages of the virus, so... some headaches and fever and exhaustion. Just like a good hangover. Ladies and gentlemen, your entertainment for the next three days. [Chuckling] Um... I would just like to say that... You are all... You're remarkable people. And... It is an honor to... It's an honor. [Inhales sharply] Well, I'll see you in there. [Clattering] [Clattering] Man : Stop right there! Stay where you are! I need Olympia. Please. Please. Help me. Don't come any closer. I need Olympia. Please help. Please. Stop right there. Please. I need Olympia. Olympia can't help you. Please! [Gunshots] [Thuds] [Gasping] Anyone in here?! Anyone in here?! Show yourself immediately! What the hell?! I thought you said this area was clear! It was. I don't know how the hell she got through, man. Damn it, we need to tighten the perimeter. Give me that. We'll check again. Man : All right, you men, spread out! I'll meet you on the other side of the street! [Spray can hisses] Man :  ♪ celebrate your leaving with a song ♪ [Reggae music playing] This one's for you, Bertrise. ♪ That's home to me ♪ 
♪ where the living's irie ♪ 
♪ at the rainbow's reach ♪ 
♪ on the day you get back ♪ You know, I still remember the first time you examined me. Well, that might just be because it was only three weeks ago, and thankfully, you do not have Alzheimer's. Oh. [Chuckles] That's some good news. [Breathes sharply] Family heirloom? Just something to keep my hands busy. Man of mystery. That's a conversation for another day. Over... What, Martinis, maybe? Let me guess. Shaken, not stirred. [As Sean connery's James Bond] Precisely, Moneypenny. [Laughing] [Normal voice] Oh, she hated that. You might actually be getting under her skin. In a good way? Hard to tell. [Chuckles] Yeah. [Chuckles] Old e-mails... From my boyfriend. [Cuff pumping] Mickey, right? That night at the vigil, you talked about him. Were you together a long time? Uh, about a year... If you count all the time we were at sea. [Velcro tears] Systolic 120. All good. Thanks. I hope he treated you right. I, uh... I'm an only child, and my parents died on 9/11. He's kind of the only person who... Might even be missing me. It reminds me of when Sam was born. He was a preemie, right? Five weeks in the N.I.C.U. [Neonatal Intensive-Care Unit] All I could do was stand there, helpless. Is that your daughter? Lily. It was her birthday last month. She'd be 11. Do you have children? No. I never quite found the time for that somehow. Better not to have a child than to not be there when they need you. Well, if this all goes as it should, you'll be back with her in a week or so. Oh, we'll be back. No doubt about that. Uh-huh. Right. Thanks. So far, so good. That's the word. Can't believe this could really be it. Going home with a vaccine. Any idea what the plan would be for mass production? I heard talk about the C.D.C. Nah, it's too far inland. Captain's thinking Fort Detrick... U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D. The question is whether or not they have any power. We could rig something to siphon off from the... Hey. Let's not jinx this, okay? It's only been six hours. [Silverware clinking] Woman in distance : Yeah, come on. [Dishes clatter] [Equipment beeping steadily] How am I doing? You're fine. The fever's your body's way of working to adjust to the treatment. Hey. When Lily was a baby, her temperature would run 102 every time she got her shots. My throat's sore. Is yours? [Swallows] No. [Weakly] But I feel like I can't lift my arm. I'm so tired. Everything all right, Master Chief? I'm fine, but... Commander Garnett looks like she's burning up over here. You should spend a little more time in the engine room, Master Chief. Everyone's body reacts differently. It's as we predicted. Hey. Come on, doc. That is way below your pay grade. I got that. Oh, no, Tex, that's really not necessary. Trust me, I can handle it. Hi. My name is Tex. I'll be your server this evening. To start with, this fine cocktail of H2O served straight up for your dining pleasure. Master Chief. Thanks. Garnett : What a gentleman. Hello. [Giggles] Never got a chance to tell ya. It was a nice eulogy for Cossetti. I don't want any more funerals, Mike. I think she's got everything in hand. You were right about her. [Chuckles] How you doing there, sugar? Good. Good. I'm okay. I'm seeing a future with the doc, even if it is just carrying her water. [Exhales] Hey, come on, girl. Kara. Kara. Kara. Doc! We got a problem! Kara! Kara! Kara! She's not responding. Resps 32, heart rate 120. Kara, it’s Rachel. Can you tell me how you’re doing? Kara? All right, she's seizing. Give me some room. Rachel : Intramuscular valium in. Give me fresh vitals. Quincy : Seizure is at the 3-minute mark. She's febrile to 104. How's that line coming, Doc? I'm working on it. Work faster or give it I.M. Valium's not working. I'm in. 60 milligrams ketorolac, I.V. push. 3 minutes, 30. Pulse ox is down 82%. We've got to lower her core temperature. I need ice! [Equipment beeping rapidly] Get me an N.G. tube. Approaching four minutes. [Panting] I got the ice! Pour the water over the ice and bring it here. All right. [Gasps] [Clicking] [Rapid beeping] 103. [Beeping continues] 102 and dropping. [Breathes deeply] [Device clicks] Everything's all right. It was just the fever. [Beeping steadies] [Breathing heavily] Thank you, Bertrise. I'll show you how to decontaminate your clothes on the way out. 
 
 A 104 degree fever can't be from the prototype. So what does that mean? Is it the virus? It's possible we didn't build a strong enough copy of Bertrise's receptors. The decoys could be breaking down. We checked it a dozen times. We must have missed something in her medical history. Repeat C.B.C. and lytes on everyone. Add on L.F.Ts and endocrine panels. That should tell us more than their blood work. [Lowered voice] He doesn't seem convinced. [Lowered voice] In fairness to Quincy, he hasn't been here. Is there anything you can give the others to help reduce the symptoms? [Normal voice] Quincy, give them 80 micrograms of interferon. Right. That should pump up their immune systems... Just in case. [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [Sighs] Dude, you're exhausted. Let's just call it right here. I can't. [Huffs] I can't. [Exhales] I don't know what I'll do if anything happens to her. Open. [Light clicks] He went in after her. What? My father. He was a firefighter. He went into the north tower. Jesus. You trying to cheer me up? [Breathes deeply] Anyway... That's why I signed up for the Navy. Lieutenant Chung said you'd want to see the latest engineering report. What can I say, doc? I'm a workaholic. [Laughs] [Exhales] Ooh, my fingers. [Inhales sharply] I can't feel... Rub your fingers together. It will help the circulation. Tex, let's lift up your shirt. Garnett's lost blood flow to her fingers. She's hypotensive. I'll get the saline. This rash... You have any idea when it started? [Breathing unevenly] No. It doesn't itch. All right, well, you let me know if that changes. Yeah. See if you can get some rest. Okay. [Light clicks] [Exhales sharply] I think you need to consider the possibility that the decoys aren't working. [Continues typing] We've never seen the virus behave this way. But we haven't been in the field with the virus for a very long time. We can't know how the symptoms might have evolved. [Grunting, panting] ♪ Hush, little baby, don't say a word ♪ 
♪ Mommy's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪ Hi. Hi, Lily. Hi, honey. Oh, your hair is all in your face. It's so pretty. ♪ And if that mockingbird won't sing ♪ 
♪ Mommy's gonna buy you a diamond ring ♪ They're delirious. [Garnett singing indistinctly] ♪ And if that looking glass gets broke ♪ 
♪ Mommy's gonna buy you a Billy Goat ♪ 
♪ And if that Billy Goat don't pull ♪ 
♪ Mommy's gonna buy you a... ♪ You make me want to love again. ♪ And if that cart and bull turn over ♪ 
♪ Mommy's gonna buy you... ♪ Baby, it's me, and I'm ready. Master Chief. Baby, I've been strong. I've tried to be strong. Master Chief, sit down. I want to see my girls. Where are they? Get me a sedative. Sarah, Annie, my girls... Russ! I want to see my... Master Chief! Sedative! I want to come with you now! Master Chief! Sedative! No, where are my girls? Master Chief... Look at me, Russ. Look at me. You're hallucinating. Where are my girls? Focus on me! Master Chief, it's not real! Where are my girls? It's me... Tom. It's not real, Master Chief! I want to see them. Annie, Sarah! My girls! It's all right, Master Chief. It's all right. You're just dreaming. [Sobbing] You're hallucinating. [Panting] It's all right. It's all right. Holy sh1t, did you see that? Maya? Maya? Doc?! Hey, doc! [Voice breaks] No. Woman : Significant progress has been made in treating the Red Flu. If you feel any symptoms, come to Olympia. We can help. You are not alone. Significant progress has been made in treating the Red Flu. [Pops, crackles] Oh! Damn it. [Sighs] Do you think they really had a treatment? At Olympia? Remember when this whole thing started? People were hoarding apple cider vinegar. Then they told us to rush to the hot springs 'cause that's a sure-fire cure. And now it's Olympia, whatever that is. Somebody's got to be making progress somewhere. It's not true what you said... That no one would miss you. I will. I'll make arrangements for the service. I want her given the Navy cross. [Breathing heavily, sniffles] [Inhales sharply] [Exhales, breathing heavily] So these aren't side effects from the vaccine. It is the virus. You're certain? Yes. No, he can't be. Maya died from a heart attack, which is not a symptom of the virus. But liver failure is, and that's what caused her blood pressure to drop. The fevers, the delirium, the hemorrhaging. There is no other explanation. There is one. We just haven't found it yet. No... Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's your solution? I.V.I.G. passive immunization. It could kill her. Chandler : Kill who? Bertrise. He wants to use the plasma from her blood and inject it directly into the patients. To give them her antibodies. No, Quincy! The amount of blood that we'd need to take from Bertrise... I am not willing to risk her life! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and watch them die. You are too important, Bertrise. And if it's not the virus that's causing this, it won't make the slightest bit of difference. But if it is the virus, we can save them. We can manage it. If there's a chance, we have to take it. I'm willing, Dr. Scott. I am. How are you feeling? Just a little tired. All right, take a sip of this. I’ve got Kara’s test results. Captain. I wasn't sure it was my place to tell you, but if it were me, I'd want to know. [Exhales deeply] Kara’s pregnant. [Labored breathing] [Whimpers] Hey. [Exhales] [Whispers] Hi, sweetheart. [Weakly] Danny? Captain said we could have a visit. That can't be good news. Don't you dare leave me. [Crying] [Gasps softly] Brief the crew. Anyone who wants a visit, now's the time. [Door opens, closes] [Crying] Quincy : Rachel? [Breathing heavily] I just needed somewhere to clear my head. You were right. The I.V.I.G. hasn't worked. Their symptoms... They're getting even worse. And Bertrise? Dr. Rios is pumping her full of saline and F.F.P. She'll be all right. Who did I think I was... That I could solve this? You're the best there is. [Exhales sharply] Yet I've failed. Come on, we’ll find another way. God... [sniffles, sighs] [Chittering] Why did it work on you? We never should have let this happen. Wasn't anything anybody could have done any differently. I'm here to see Kara. Six people, Mike. Six. Can you hear me, buddy? [Whooshing, steady beeping] Can you hear us a-at all? Come on, Miller. We still need you, man. Chung : You, uh... You gotta stick around, ma'am. You know I can't be chief engineer. Ch.eng. Chung? Come on. [Chuckles] [Pumping] Tex : [Exhales] [Sighs] When they tell the story about the great plague of the 21st century, they'll talk about you. The six. [Door opens] Rachel : Quincy! Microcellular inflammation, oxidative stress, immune vascular dysfunction. And Bertrise... always sick when she was a kid and yet immune to this. How could I have missed it? Can't say that I'm following you. What we're seeing is an autoimmune response... The rashes, the liver failure, the poor circulation. What happened to Maya was her own body attacking itself. The virus is adapting. Once it attached to the decoy, it changed shape. It exposed its human gene. Niels' gene. And that signaled to their immune systems to launch an attack on every cell in their body. The monkey doesn't have any human genes, so it didn't have the same reaction. So how do you stop it? It need to modify the decoy and hide Niels' gene. If our immune systems can't see it, it won't react. No, no, no. There is no way to get their bodies to manufacture the modified decoy on their own. Yes, there is. We use the Arctic strain as a Trojan horse. [Bubbling] [Clatters] You're gonna be okay, buddy. We got this. It didn't work, did it? Take a look. I was thinking it might be high time for the samba. Tex. The merengue? In bed. Now. Oh, I thought she'd never ask. [Laughter] Hey, And? Put that down, relax. No, sir. [Exhales] I told you. Yes, you did. Dr. Scott? The baby? Will be born immune. [Chuckles] Jeter : It was touch and go there for a while. [Whispers] Hey, how's it goin'? [Laughs, crying] [Liquid sloshes] [Sighs] Can we talk... About what I hope... Is going on in there? [Slosh] [Sighs] We have it. We have a vaccine. We don't just have... A vaccine. We have... The cure. You mean... I mean that we can save people who are already sick. [Sniffles] [Gasps, sighs] [Gasping] [Laughs] [Sniffles, laughs] [Exhales sharply] [Water pouring] Sam : Grandpa, what do you think? Looking good, kiddo. Don't forget the "151" on the hull. [Faucet turns off] Thank you. [Radio static] Mm! Mm! Both : [Laugh] Uh... uh... Hey, eat. This is W6ABH. Oh... This is Jed Chandler, Clearwater, Virginia. I'm listening on 14.441 kilohertz, looking for  U.S.S. Nathan James. Captain Tom Chandler... If you're still out there, please respond. Over. [Static, switches click] Looking for  U.S.S. Nathan James. [Static, switches click] Captain Tom Chandler. If you're still out there, please respond.
