 Yes, sir. I understand completely, sir. 
 Things go that way sometimes. 
 Yes, sir, I will. You can count on me. 
 Kids, come on out. Time for deployment gifts. 
 Ashley : Coming! 
 Sam : I'm coming, too! 
 Photos, videos, and playlists. 
 Not as good as a warm body in your bed, but it'll just have to do till I see you again. 
 Sam : Wait, Ashley. Let me get it! 
 [Sprinkler hissing] 
 Darien, I'm not going to the Med. 
 Navy's sending us to the Arctic. 
 The Arctic? That's crazy. 
 Some cold weather test on a new weapons system. 
 It's all classified. It's happening very fast. 
 We're gonna be at complete radio silence. 
 No e-mails, no calls. 
 For how long? 
 Six months, maybe five. 
 Figures. 
 It's my last tour for a while. 
 Then I'll be around the house so much, you'll be sick of me, I promise. 
 Sit down. 
 Did you wrap this yourself? 
 I did. 
 It's from the championship game. 
 Keep it next to your bed. 
 I love it, buddy. That's really great. 
 Thank you. 
 [Papers rustle] 
 [Sighs] 
 It's beautiful. 
 It's not regulation, so I know you can't wear it. 
 How about I keep it in the front pocket of my uniform right over my heart? 
 [Sighs] 
 Man over radio : I need help, if anyone out there can hear me. 
 I'm just outside... [Speaks indistinctly] 
 [Switch clicks] Woman: I need help, please. 
 If you can hear me... 
 [Switch clicks, man speaking Spanish] 
 [Switches clicking, woman speaks indistinctly] 
 [Static, man speaking indistinctly] 
 [Door opens] 
 [Sighs] 
 I sent the guys on a break. 
 [Sighs] Figured I'd see what's going on in the outside world. 
 It's a lot of static. 
 Yeah, whatever you might hear out there is not gonna be particularly uplifting. 
 Well, my dad had an old ham radio set in his cabin, and I thought maybe if Darien was... 
 It's our anniversary. 
 You never come down here. 
 [Sighs] No. 
 Yeah, I don't think Christine's looking for me. 
 Come on. 
 Well... 
 Before we left, things were pretty ragged between us. 
 When I finally got her on the phone after we lifted EMCOM, she... told me about Lucas. 
 Losing a son is one thing, but dealing with it on your own is just... 
 There was nothing you could do. 
 That is not what she wanted to hear. 
 I'll leave you to it. 
 There's still a chance, Mike. 
 For all of us. 
 [Door closes] 
 Jordan! 
 [Man shouts indistinctly] 
 On the side! Shoot it! Shoot it! 
 Hey! 
 I'm open! I'm open! 
 Right here! 
 That's what I want. 
 Come on, Miller. Thought you could hoop. 
 Yeah, I can. 
 You can, huh? 
 [Grunts] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 [Water splashes] 
 Oh, man. That was our last ball. 
 [Hip-hop music playing] 
 Nice, buddy. 
 So why Costa Rica? 
 Dr. Scott's gonna need some primates to test her vaccine. 
 Apparently, there's a monkey reserve a few miles upriver. 
 She doesn't have the vaccine, does she? 
 She's working on it. Meanwhile, we move forward. 
 Hey. 
 You think there'll be a beach? 
 I could really use a beach right now. 
 What? What the hell is this? 
 Wasn't this on the list to be rebuilt? 
 Yes, sir. 
 The chief engineer put the hts on it, but we're out of spare parts. 
 They're cobbling everything together from scratch. 
 Well, she's laid up in medical bay, and it's on me now if that gasket blows. 
 No one gets off watch till it's done. 
 [Chugging sound] 
 Does anybody hear that? 
 Hear what, sir? 
 She's not purring. 
 [Sighs] 
 This is the messdecks for the enlisted in here, although I think you'll probably take your meals with the officers in the wardroom. 
 Man, these are some cramped quarters. 
 I don't know how y'all do it. 
 Four months you've been on this ship now? 
 Almost five. 
 Five? Wow. 
 Ma'am. 
 Whoa. She is tasty. 
 Now is she not? 
 Oh, lighten up, dude. I'm just saying. 
 It's the end of the world, right? 
 Excuse me. 
 Nothing wrong with spreading a little love around, and I ain't Navy, so... 
 Yeah, well, they are, which means no fraternizing, period. 
 Oh, I get it. I get it. 
 Hey, um... Where is the lab? 
 Maybe pay a visit to that scientist. 
 She's a civilian, right? 
 I can't believe I have to bunk with you. 
 Seriously, where's the lab? 
 [Machines beep steadily] 
 [Instrument clatters] 
 [Beep, whirs] 
 [Computer beeping] 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 I need to complete the sequence analysis of the three known virus strains... 
 Primordial, Egyptian, and the sample that I extracted from the cruise ship. 
 You do what you gotta do, but you do it alone. 
 I'm not letting him back in that lab. 
 Believe me, Quincy is the last person that I wanna see right now, but I need him. 
 And we're right on the verge here. 
 That man tried to infect this entire ship. 
 You're not listening to me. 
 This is one procedure that I cannot do alone. 
 What about Doc Rios? 
 I am sure that he is an excellent ship's doctor, but I need a highly trained expert in bioinformatics just for a few hours. 
 I promise that I won't let him near anything that could endanger the ship. 
 [Sighs] 
 What do you want? 
 I managed the sequencing. 
 All three strains. 
 Wasn't sure that I was gonna be able to do it with the equipment on hand, but the data is in. 
 And you need me to analyze it. 
 Yes. 
 Look, Quincy, I am sorry for you and for your family, for... Kelly. 
 And Ava, of course. 
 And I know there's nothing that I can say, but I also know that you understand that the world needs us right now... 
 Please don't preach to me, Rachel. 
 I've had it up to here with your high-mindedness. 
 I'm not preaching. 
  The world needs you,  and that's just the way you like it. 
 Quincy, what are you talking about? 
 I know that you're in pain here, but there's nothing... 
 I told you we should share our information, that sneaking off to the Arctic wasn't the way to do this, but you loved the whole "top secret" thing. 
 That's not fair, because we both agreed... 
 This was the only way we knew what we were doing. 
 Quincy, where is this coming from? 
 This plague is the best thing that's ever happened to you. 
 Rachel Scott saves the day. 
 This is not my fault. 
 No, it's mine... 
 For following you. 
 I mean, what were you risking, really? 
 You've got no family. You've got no friends. 
 Truth is, you don't have any skin in the game. 
 You have no idea what I have lost. 
 The guy who pops into town for a twice-monthly screw doesn't count. 
 [Scoffs] You don't know about loss because you don't care about anyone but yourself. 
 Where the hell do you get off thinking your pain is any greater than anyone else's? 
 There's a whole ship full of people out there who've lost just as much as you, and yet they keep finding a way to march on, but you... 
 You're a coward. 
 Nothing more. 
 Probably a great deal less. 
 [Huffs] 
 Diplomacy's not necessarily your strong suit. 
 I can't even look at him. 
 Well, you said you can't do it without him, so one way or another, we're gonna have to get him on board, right? 
 You do it. You talk to him. 
 I'm not that good with people anyw... 
 [Electricity crackles, power surging] 
 What on earth is that? 
 [Equipment beeping] 
 Bridge, this is M.P.A. 
 We've got high temperature on number 1 and 2 generators. 
 Commencing stage one load-shed. 
 I just lost surface search radar. 
 [Electronic whir, power surges down] 
 [Door creaks] 
 Tell Captain Chandler that we need A/C and power, or everything will be lost, and hurry! 
 Right away. 
 [Under breath] Damn it. 
 No, that's not it. Trace the line. 
 We can't run at this temperature. 
 We're gonna overheat! 
 Pull the filters. Let's see what's going on in there. 
 [Explosion] Whoa! 
 Damn it! 
 [Alarm sounding] 
 [Bell clanging] Fire, fire, fire. 
 Class Bravo fire, main engine room two. 
 Away the at-sea fire party, provide from repair five. 
 D.C.A., it's the captain. What's the status? 
 I say again, D.C.A., what is the status? 
 [Coughing] 
 [Alarm sounding] 
 Mr. Chung! Everybody okay? 
 Yes, sir. The fire's out. 
 What's our sitrep? 
 It started in the seawater service system intake, sir. 
 Something must have torn off the filters, and sea life bloom got in... 
 That's on me. We cut it a little tight getting out of Gitmo. 
 Corals must have knocked off the filters. How bad is it? 
 It's too soon to tell, sir, but with the intakes down, we've lost our ability to cool the engine oil for the mains. 
 What about the generators? Did they survive? 
 Just generator three, sir, and we're lucky it was offline during the time. 
 I want all the electricity diverted to the C.I.C. 
 And Dr. Scott's lab. 
 Under any circumstance, she needs that room cooled. 
 Do you understand? 
 Aye, sir. Sorry, sir. 
 Don't be sorry. 
 Let's just get it fixed. Yes, sir. 
 [Clank, power surges on] 
 [Sighs] Thank you. Thank you. 
 Captain's on the bridge. 
 Report, sir. 
 R.O. system's down for now. Let's initiate conservation. 
 Salt water shaving only, no showers. 
 Water strictly used for cooking and drinking. 
 [Sighs] It's gonna be 100 degrees today. 
 I'd like to reduce Manning at all watch stations and suspend all non-essential activities. 
 Good. Meanwhile, I've got other fish for you to fry. 
 [Tears paper] 
 Good. I didn't wake ya. [Sniffs] 
 [Sighs] 
 A hot one, huh? 
 Reminds me of August in Chicago. 
 That's where I'm from. You know that? 
 Yeah, I was a cop. Homicide. 
 South side. I was good at it, too. 
 [Mouth full] You mind if I smoke? 
 Please don't. 
 Mm. Mmh-mmh. 
 [Lighter clicks] 
 [Exhales] 
 [Exhales deeply] You ever hear of Keelhauling? 
 Can't say that I have, no. 
 Really? 
 See, back in the mid 1800s when a sea Captain encountered a particularly problematic sailor, he'd have him bound with rope, thrown over the side of the ship, dragged underneath the hull. 
 Poor b*st*rd would bounce and scrape along the keel, barnacles and such. 
 But when he'd come up on the other side, if he wasn't drowned or decapitated... 
 He tended to be a lot more cooperative. 
 Keelhauling. [Sniffs] 
 Just off the top of my head, I can think of about 200 sailors on board this ship who'd like to try that out on you. 
 Captain Chandler would never allow such a thing. 
 Hmm, maybe. 
 Maybe not. 
 Personally, I never found torture that effective in my line of work. I told you I was a cop, right? 
 You did, yes. 
 Yeah. 
 See, I always found that if you just laid out the facts for a guy, treated him with a little respect, maybe give him a chance to redeem himself, earn somethin' back... 
 He'd make the right choice. 
 You can't force me back into the lab. 
 I won't do it. 
 Well, suit yourself. [Exhales] 
 But remember, we got a hard and fast rule on this ship. 
 [Sighs] Anything that doesn't serve a purpose is gone. 
 Ain't no fat on the bone here. 
 [Sniffs] Hope you can hold your breath. 
 I want sunlight. 
 And someone to play chess with. 
 Someone good. 
 Did you reset the electronic governor controls? 
 Cycled them three times. They're completely wiped. 
 [Sighs] Did you try to rig casualty power cables from main one? 
 There's no way to do it. The main cable riser's melted. 
 Mr. Chung, you qualified E.O.O.W. faster than anyone I've ever seen, and you could rebuild most of this power plant with your eyes closed. 
 You're going to handle this. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Door creaks open] 
 [Door closes] 
 I'm guessing the gene sequencing showed a high degree of variation. 
 You're having trouble distinguishing what's causing the enhanced pathogenesis and what's just background noise. 
 Right you are... As usual. 
 Let's get to it, shall we? 
 It's gonna take a week, maybe 10 days at all stop to repair the engine damage, sir. 
 A week? 
 We can run one of the four turbines on manual, but... the seawater system's fried, so we... we can't cool the engines. 
 And how long can we run without overheating? 
 Maybe an hour, but then another five to let it cool down, but I'll have to wash down the engines before we can even try that. 
 So what's the issue? Something with the R.O. systems? 
 The circuit breakers in the load centers... 
 They're completely burnt out. 
 We can't make fresh drinking water. 
 And how long to fix that? 
 Also a week, sir. And that's the real problem. 
 The entire time we were in Gitmo, we weren't filtering water from the harbor because we didn't know if it was contaminated by the virus. 
 [Sighs] So we're down to... 
 What, 3,000 gallons of fresh water? 
 Just about, sir. 
 [Sighs] 
 Slattery : Costa Rica will have to wait. 
 Agreed. 
 We'll have to dead-stick until we get that one engine on line. 
 We got an hour every six to make as much distance as we can to find the safest place to make port and get fresh water. 
 I'm recommending we head here... Serrana Bank. 
 It's uninhabited, which means it should be untouched by the virus, and it gets over a hundred inches of rain per year. 
 We can anchor there until the engineers get us back on line. 
 E.T.A.? Given our current limitations with engine output? 
 Taking into account projected winds and current... 
 Six, six and a half days. 
 They've gotta be someplace else. 
 The area has been pretty well-charted, sir. 
 Maybe we can find an abandoned ship with a fresh water supply. All right, send the U.A.V. 
 Widest possible range in all directions. 
 It finds any source of water, I wanna know about it. 
 Aye, sir. 
 Set course for that island. 
 Let's get that engine back on line. 
 Yes, Captain. 
 [Door closes] 
 Six days. Even at our most severe rations, we're gonna have to travel the last two without any water. 
 Day three... 
 Day three, people start to die. 
 Surface search radar off standby. 
 Gain set to low. 
 No sign of land, sir. 
 U.A.V.'s got nothing either. Keep looking. 
 Careful. Don't spill that. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 All that water in the ocean... It's almost impossible to make it drinkable. Hence, the stills. 
 Oh, yeah. I am dying over here. 
 [Can tab fizzes] 
 Ah. You heard of water into wine? 
 This is beer into water. 
 That is enough to make a grown man cry. 
 Tell me about it. 
 Sir, 10 seconds until engines up. 
 Light off engine in 5...4...3...2...1. 
 [Clank, whirring] 
 Starboard engine ahead full. 
 Aye, sir. Starboard engine ahead full. 
 Starboard engine ahead full, aye. 
 [Whirring, power surging] 
 [Clank, whirring] 
 We've got one hour till engine shutdown. 
 Let's make some time. 
 
 
 
 [Speaks indistinctly] 
 Man : Sector 3 is negative. 
 No vessels, no land. 
 Man : U.A.V to sector 4. 
 [Alarm sounding] Mr. Chung... 
 I know, I know, she's too hot. We're pushing this. 
 Engine shutdown in 5, 4, 3, 2... 
 [Switch clicks] 
 [Sighs] Chung, how are we looking? 
 We got any wiggle room? 
 The engine is piping hot, sir. We cannot push it any further. 
 [Alarm sounding] 
 E-stop one Alpha G.T.M. Let's shut it down and let it cool off. 
 E-stop one Alpha G.T.M. 
 It's dark. Why hasn't it gotten any cooler? 
 It's hotter inside. 
 Hell, I'll sleep outside standing up if I had to. 
 [Squeaking] 
 [Machine beeping] 
 Finished. 
 I suppose you'll want to triple-check the results. 
 [Taps keyboard keys] 
 [Computer beeping] You were right. 
 This could be the one that works. 
 When you look up at the night sky,  just know that wherever I am, I'm looking at the same stars. 
 And I'll be thinking about you and you. 
 So no matter what, we'll always be together. 
 Okay? 
 [Sprinkler hissing] 
 What's this? 
 Well, you said you wanted a rain check on the tea. 
 Sorry, I'm not equipped with finger sandwiches or scones. 
 I'd have thought you would've used your water on a colder drink. 
 This can't be tea. 
 It's Camellia sinensis. It's an organic green. 
 I actually save it for special occasions. 
 Such as? 
 The breakthrough that I've been working towards. 
 It's happened. 
 I have a vaccine prototype, and it's time to test. 
 I would've brought champagne, but... 
 This will do just fine. 
 60 seconds until we need to power down the engine again, Captain. 
 T.A.O., bridge. What's the status on the U.A.V.? 
 Barker : Sorry, sir. No sign of land or other vessels at sea in 360-degree search. 
 [Machine beeps] 
 10 seconds, sir. Current destination is best option for water. 
 We got a problem in the lab. 
 Lynn : That's all we have? 
 Chung : Four breakers... That was the last one. 
 Oh, no. 
 Tell me the virus is secure. 
 Yes, everything is sealed. What's happened? 
 Ma'am, the relay switch overheated and shorted out the breakers on the last generator. 
 Well, is it beyond repair? 
 Afraid so. 
 You understand that without power, the temperature inside my cooling units are rising. 
 If they go over 41 degrees fahrenheit, we'll lose the primordial sample, the sample from the cruise ship, and the experimental vaccine. 
 What about the portable generator in the r&a locker? 
 That seized up during maintenance in the Arctic. 
 Every time we run the engines, you get power to the lab. 
 I made sure... Power for one hour for every six is not sufficient. 
 I need the virus at a constant low temperature. 
 We can throw it overboard. 
 Throw what overboard? 
 All your work, into the water, to cool it down. 
 We're in the tropics. The water must be 80 degrees. 
 Not at the bottom. 
 Well, even if the water is cold enough, the pressure will crush the glass containers. 
 Well, I'm sure we can rig something for that. 
 Can't we, Lieutenant? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Look, I appreciate that, but if you sink the samples, there's no way that you can move the ship forward without raising that case towards the surface. 
 She's right. We'll be stuck in place until we get the engines repaired, and we're already running out of drinking water. 
 If we can figure out a way to spin the propellers, we can generate enough electricity to cool the lab, correct? 
 Yes, sir, but how can we spin the propellers without the engine? 
 Rig the case now. 
 Get your samples ready to put 'em in the ocean. 
 Please be certain they're secure. 
 It's good to go. 
 Easy! 
 Due respect, Captain, we only have a small window of time to make it to the island on the water we have. 
 The hours we spend doing this we will not be able to make up. 
 Gator checked the barometer. 
 Said there's a low front coming in from the east. 
 We get the winds we need, we can do this. 
 Relying on the winds? 
 Our entire mission is in that case. 
 I have to say this, sir. 
 If the winds don't blow our way, we kill our crew. 
 Rachel : No, you're sure it's gonna hold? 
 Chung : It's gonna hold. 
 10 feet from the surface. 
 Almost there. 
 Okay, it's in. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Shouldn't the temperature be dropping faster? 
 It takes a moment for the thermostat to catch up. 
 [Under breath] Come on, come on. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Man : 300 feet. 
 [Normal voice] Come on. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 [Beeping] 
 We've hit bottom. 
 Man : All right, tie off the line. 
 [Beeping resumes] 
 Chung : 42... 
 41... 
 Come on, come on. 
 40. We did it. 
 [Sighs] 
 Thank God. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 [Exhaling deeply] Dear God. 
 Well, you got your sunshine. 
 Never seen a day as windless. 
 I'm a gambling man myself. 
 Captain's put all his chips in the middle of the table here. 
 Sure hope he's got an ace up his sleeve. 
 Sir, the boatswain's mates have loaded pilot chutes into launchers. 
 Strong enough breeze, and we'll shoot them high enough to engage the larger chutes. 
 That should give us just enough speed to turn the prop and get electricity. 
 Won't help us make water, but... 
 So where's the wind? 
 Gator said the wind was coming. 
 It's gotta come, right? 
 I'm guessing the Navy told you about my car accident. 
 Yeah. Yeah. They did. 
 Well, there's something  they don't even know about. 
 It was my fault. 
 Tried to pass a car on a curve. 
 Didn't see the oncoming truck. 
 I killed my wife and my girls. 
 I was in the I.C.U. for 82 days. 
 Seven times I coded, seven times they brought me back. 
 In between, I had plenty of time to think and to wonder, why did God leave me here? 
 Why did he spare me? 
 There must be a purpose, some reason. 
 Well, that's what I told myself. 
 That's how I woke up every day and put one foot in front of the other. 
 It was faith that got me through. 
 But these past weeks, that faith has been replaced with certainty. 
 I am here for a reason, as are you, as is everyone aboard this ship. 
 You are here to lead us, and we are here to follow, to execute your vision. 
 I don't have a vision. 
 You do. 
 When you stuck your hand in that engine fuse, and you turned us away from home, when you got us out of gitmo, there's a... A voice inside you. 
 Maybe it's your highest self, maybe it's the voice of God. 
 I don't know, but... It's a voice of... hope. 
 You've listened to it so far. 
 All you have to do is keep listening. 
 Our journey does not end here. 
 "And Moses answered the people, 'do not be afraid. 
 "'Stand firm, and you will see the deliverance "'the lord will bring you today. 
 "'The lord will fight for you. 
 You need only be still.'" trust that there's something else out there, something bigger than ourselves, something better, 'cause right now we feel very, very small. 
 We're not too proud to say we need help, and we need it right now. 
 So we bow our heads together, and we lift this prayer to you and ask that you protect us so that we may do good in the world that you made. 
 [Thud, water streaming] 
 Amen. 
 Officers : Amen. 
 [Flag flapping] 
 Boats! Prepare to launch the chutes! 
 Port side, on my mark! 
 3...2...1. Fire! 
 [Shots] 
 Second gun! Fire! 
 [Shot] 
 Third gun! 
 Fire! 
 [Shot] 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Hell, yeah. [Chuckles] 
 [Whirring] 
 Set modified condition three. Bring up that case! 
 Man : Aye, sir. 
 [Exhales] 
 Okay. 
 Gently does it. 
 [Metal clanks] 
 Easy. 
 Central, this is M.P.A. 
 Close load circuits on the impeller alternators. 
 Let's do this thing. 
 [Clanks, power surging] 
 [Clanks] 
 Bravo Zulu, Mr. Chung. 
 This is U.S.S. Nathan James,  hailing any vessel in our vicinity. 
 We are operating without radar. 
 We believe we are approximately a hundred miles east, northeast of Serrana Bank. 
 We've been over two days without water. 
 Hailing any vessel... 
 [Radio static] 
 In the vicinity of Serrana Bank. 
 We are in distress and require assistance. 
 Sail still holding, sir. 
 Winds from the north, northeast at 14 knots. 
 Making 4 knots over water, sir. 
 How long till engines up? 
 [Gruffly] Four hours. 
 [Telephone beeps] 
 [Receiver clatters] 
 Go for X.O. 
 X.O., I've got 10 more down. 
 I think it's time to stand down all non-essential watch stations. 
 Copy that. Proceed. 
 [Receiver clatters] 
 [Slattery clears throat] 
 I'm sorry. 
 I thought we'd make up more time. 
 All right, my friends, you're gonna be just fine, okay? 
 You're all right. Head up. 
 Just sip. There you go. Keep still. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Keep still. 
 Rachel : Okay, uh, take small sips. Careful. 
 That's good. 
 Can I join you all? 
 Are you kiddin' me? Bring it here, right beside ol' Tex. 
 [Hushed indistinct conversation] 
 Man : How you feeling? Are you all right? 
 We're not gonna make it, are we? 
 [Ship creaking] 
 [Men coughing] 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 [Coughs] 
 [Seagulls crying] Captain? 
 Incoming low slow flying objects 20 degrees relative. 
 Identify as seagulls. 
 Birds mean land. 
 Radar's still down, sir, but... That sounds pretty good to me. 
 Water. 
 We made it. 
 We made it, sir. 
 [Man shouts indistinctly] 
 [Cheering] 
 I believe there are a few of you who have earned some R&R. 
 [Switch clicks] See? 
 Piece of cake. 
 Never doubted it, sir. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Guess we got a beach after all. 
 We sure did. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Indistinct conversations continue] 
 [Laughter] Man: Fire it up. 
 I don't see a cup of water in your hand. 
 Take this one, too. Take this one, too. 
 [Laughs] Okay. 
 Man : Yo! All right. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Guitar playing] 
 Chandler : Mr. Chung! 
 [Clank] 
 Figured you could use this. 
 Fresh from the island. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 I, uh, got the auxiliary power up. 
 At least we can keep the doctor's work on ice while I make the repairs. 
 You did well, Lieutenant. 
 Ah, I don't know, sir. 
 I keep thinking maybe I could have prevented that fire if I'd checked the filters better.

 Let's just say I'm looking forward to the chief engineer getting back on her feet.

 We all are. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Let's see what you got. 
 Are you watching?

 The hands. 
 Hands. All hands. I'm all hands. 
 I'm all hands!

 Um, maybe another time. 
 I'm an excellent teacher. 
 I have no doubt. 
 So you gotta move those hips for the Hula. 
 I bet you could. 
 Where you going? 
 Over this way. 
 Need an escort? 
 Uh... 
 Maybe I'll take a rain check on that. 
 All right. 
 All right. 
 Dude, rain check! 
 Lock and load, ladies. It's Hula time.

 Cheers.
