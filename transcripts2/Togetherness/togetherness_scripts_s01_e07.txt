 Brett : Sophie, can you finish your eggs, please, honey? 
 Michelle : We have a big party today and you need your energy, okay? 
 Tina is bringing a really fancy bounce castle. 
 All right, kids are dressed, we got the tables and chairs outside, donation jar. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Okay, I think... 
 I think we're good. 
 I think we're good. Awesome. 
 Okay. 
 All right, well, I might actually head out now, if that's cool with you? 
 What do you mean? Like, leave? 
 I was thinking if I... I could go to this thing on the earlier side, and that way I could be back for, like, the... the last part of the party. 
 Brett, what... like, what is this thing that you're going to? 
 It's a gathering at Linda's house, of, like, likeminded people, and they're spiritual and they're looking for things. 
 And, I mean, look, I don't understand it, but I'm interested. 
 You know what? I'm still... I'm pretty confused about this Linda person and who she is to you. 
 She's my friend, like, you know, you're friends with David and you guys have your whole charter-school venture. 
 And we have spent every Saturday as family day for the last five years. 
 Yeah. 
 Is it so horrible if we just go our own way for once? 
 Tina : Who's ready to party?! 
 (door closes) 
 Did you get the bouncy castle? 
 I will be back, okay? 
 Okay. I'll see you at some point. 
 Tina : ... that's the silliest thing I ever heard in my whole life. 
 Of course I did. I got the f*cking... (door closes) the "fubalin" biggest bouncy castle with the most colors. 
 Thank you. 
 Here's a surprise for you. 
 Oh, your cards! 
 Can you believe it? Don't touch. 
 Oh, sorry. They're very beautiful. 
 Aren't they amazing? 
 These are for all your friends' mommies and daddies. 
 So they can rent all my bouncy castles. 
 That thing is so huge, I need help setting it up. 
 Oh, I have to put all that food out, but, um, I bet Alex could help you. 
 Who? 
 What? Alex. 
 Good morning, Michelle. 
 Is there anything I can help you with today? 
 Uh, yeah. Tina needs some help setting up the bounce house. 
 I don't know who that is. 
 I don't know any Alex. 
 I don't recall a Tina. Who's that? 
 Okay. 
 I smell a funky odor. 
 It's like a... it's like a dirty sock that's been stuck on a couch for years... 
 Michelle, OMG, I'm sensing a presence. 
 ... underneath something that's festering... 
 Do you have the number for Ghostbusters? 
 ... not doing anything with their lives. 
 Dah-dah-dah. 
 You know what, Soph, what do you say you and I go do the bouncy castle? 
 It's a mean ghost. 
 Start setting stuff up and doing stuff. 
 Let's go! 
 This is not... 
 Sophie : Okay. 
 Whoa! 
 Whoa, did you feel that? 
 (door closes) 
 Okay. It's a little bit childish. 
 She started it. 
 (Tina screaming) Oh, my God! 
 Hey. What's going on? 
 There's spiders, Mommy, and it's really muddy. 
 Okay, be careful, Soph. Step back. Thank you. 
 TT, do you need a hand? 
 We're good. (Laughs) 
 Right? We just... a little... it's a little dusty. 
 But we're good. 
 Yeah? 
 Yes. Of course! 
 Okay. 
 Right? 
 Sophie : Yeah. We're good. 
 This is gonna be the best. 
 Tina : Yep. 
 It's gonna be the best.

 Woman : Wow! 
 Man : Yeah, open yourself up. 
 Oh! 
 (woman giggling) 
 Hey, peace. 
 Man : Welcome. 
 Oh, hi. 
 Hi. 
 Uh, I'm Brett. 
 Scott here. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Do you know, does Linda live here? 
 Yeah, sort of. Yeah. 
 Um, she comes and goes, like a lot of people. 
 Her dad left her this weird f*cking McMansion thing, and I take care of it. I get people set up if they need stuff. 
 You want to crash here? 
 Me? No, no, I'm good. I have, like, a... 
 I got a home and stuff. So I'm all set, thanks. 
 Um... Oh, there she is now. 
 Hi. 
 I kind of feel like you might need some stuff. 
 I'm sorry? 
 You want some of my tea? 
 Uh, what is it? 
 Mushrooms. 
 (laughs) Yeah. I don't... I don't really do that well with that stuff. 
 I get a little panicky, so... But thank you. 
 It's cool. Linda, she doesn't need stuff anymore. 
 You know, me... I sometimes need stuff, though. 
 What do you mean? 
 Just, I have a hard time enjoying life, and just opening up. You know, I get so stressed. 
 You don't seem stressed at all. 
 You seem very open to me. 
 Dude, this helps. 
 But that's awesome, man, if you don't need it, then f*ck. 
 (laughs) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 You have one child, right? 
 They're not even school-aged yet. 
 Yeah, I bet he's gonna thank you. 
 (motor sputtering) 
 Is everything okay? 
 Yeah, there's just something wrong with the compressor. 
 Oh, hey, well let... let me give you a hand. 
 No, I got it. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. I got it. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Alex, thank you so much. 
 You are seriously a rock star. 
 (laughs) 
 You have been so great. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 Hmm. 
 (shouting) It's really nice to help people when they've given you so much in return! 
 I am happy to do anything you may need, Michelle! 
 This is getting a little ridiculous at this point. 
 I'm just getting started. 
 Okay. 
 Just... just getting started. 
 Yeah. Can I ask you something? 
 Does Brett seem okay to you lately? 
 I think so. I mean, for an a**l, grumpy vegan, he seems to be in the zone of okay. 
 He seems off to me. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. Just maybe could you, like, keep an eye out, just let me know if anything's... is up? 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Of course. 
 Thank you. How are you doing? 
 I don't know. I guess I'm just questioning it all... the exercising, and really the whole acting thing in general. 
 Yeah, maybe I just have a fat soul and maybe I'm just supposed to be... 
 Sorry, you, no... I, uh, I'm going to be right back. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, no, it's all right. 
 Hey! 
 Hi. Great turnout. 
 Hey, thank you. Well, yeah, it's pretty good, right? 
 These are my daughters... Esperanza... 
 Hi. 
 ... and Lucy. 
 Hi. 
 Hi, nice to meet you guys. 
 Michelle. 
 So which one of you is the rollerblader? 
 That would be me. 
 Yes, I saw your little, like, pink cute rollerblade. 
 It was so cute. And you don't? That's not for you? 
 Mm-mm. That... no. I'd fall and break my ankle or something. 
 I would too. I would die. 
 (laughs) 
 Do you want to go get on this thing? 
 Yeah. Bye. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. Oh, they're so pretty. 
 They are.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Linda : Who have you liked the best so far here? 
 Um, these people... are weird. 
 Why do you say they're weird? 
 This is not... not bad weird. 
 Can we? 
 Yeah, I think we can look. 
 We need another one of those 500. Good. 
 Yeah. The 500s are my favorites. 
  Oh, kind of low. 
 Tha... thanks, Glenn. 
 f*cking Glenn. 
 f*cking Glenn. 
 My whole life, everybody told me, "Stop weirding out." 
 It was used as a verb in my house. 
 Like, "Don't weird out, Brett." 
 And I don't know, it's cool to be around it, 'cause these people are... they're kind of amazing. 
 And I'm, like, jealous or something 'cause they seem, I don't know, they seem like they're getting there, and I'm, uh... 
 Wait, where's... where's "there"? 
 I don't know. 
 I just feel like I'm not... it's where I'm not. 
 (laughs) That's where... that's where it is. You know? 
 I don't know. 
 Yeah, where is Brett? 
 He had to work today. 
 Oh. Got it. 
 I lied just now. 
 Oh. 
 He just kind of didn't want to come. 
 (sighs) 
 You know, things are actually, um, not great right now. Sorry. 
 I shouldn't be, um, saying all of this. 
 Why? 
 It's too... it's too much. I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 It's weird. 
 No, it's okay. 
 You're just really easy to talk to. 
 I've been there. 
 Brett : Can I pet him? 
 It's up to you. 
 (clicks tongue) 
 Horses don't like me 'cause I'm anxious and I'm... Wait a minute. 
 Hi. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. I had a little bit of Scott's tea. 
 And I think I might be starting to feel it a little bit. 
 Wait, you had Scott's tea? 
 Why do you say it like that? 
 It... it's okay. It's... 
 Why did he stop moving? 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 But, um, it can be a little intense. 
 But you're okay. Okay? 
 Yeah. I'm great, yeah. 
 I'm... I'm actually, uh, I feel good. 
 I'm super mellow. So... 
 Mmm. Hey, come see my friend, Brett. 
 Whoa. I think he likes me. 
 I think he likes you a lot. 
 Hi. Oh, my God, he's so calm. 
 How could he be so calm? That's crazy. 
 He doesn't have to be anything but who he is. 
 I think I'm gonna start... 
 I think I'm gonna cry a little bit, is that okay? 
 Sure. 
 No. I'm okay. I'm okay. 
 Linda? 
 Yes, Brett? 
 Can I touch... can I touch your hair and touch his hair? 
 Of course. 
 
 
 
 Hey, here. Hi. 
 Look what I got. Look what I got. 
 You guys are my two favorite people in the whole world right now. 
 Hey, Linda, I think I'm about to start to freak out now. 
 Okay. 
 Is that okay? 
 Yep. We're gonna go for a walk. 
 Okay? 
 Okay, Jenny, no. Honey? Please. 
 Mom, no. No! 
 Please. Come here, listen. 
 I don't want you to go in there, okay? It's not safe. 
 Maybe another time. Hey. 
 We're going to be... we're going to be up and running in two seconds. 
 I'm so sorry. Get back in there. 
 We're not going... we're not going to go in. 
 She can go back in. 
 Maybe later. 
 Why don't we go get some cake? 
 Tina : Yeah, she can go in. 
 Let's go get some cake, okay? 
 TT? 
 Tina : Please don't call me that. 
 Okay. Hey, listen, we don't even need the bounce house today. 
 You know what? Let's just pack it up and bring the play set back in. 
 Let's just not worry about it. 
 (laughs) 
 The play set? Are you kidding me? 
 The play set's not going to cut it. 
 This is the feature of your party. 
 It's not the... 
 I... I think that it's fine to just, like, forget about this. 
 Can you just let me do my job? 
 Please? 
 Okay. 
 (whirring) 
 Tina, I'll call my buddy and get a bounce house delivered. 
 No, no, no. This is gonna work. 
 Seriously. 
 I'm doing this fine! 
 (cell phone rings) 
 Hey, bro. You all right? 
 (Brett out of breath) Alex, hey. 
 I'm a little lost and I'm a little scared, but everything's going to be okay. 
 What's happening? Where are you? 
 I just want you to know, no matter what happens, you'll always be my soul brother. 
 Linda : Brett! 
 Who is that? Is somebody chasing you? 
 Brett : Huh? Oh, that. I think so.

 Brett!

 Brett? 
 Brett? 
 I love this room so much. 
 Mm. 
 Alex : Brett! 
 Brett : You don't need any more space than this to live. 
 Hi, Alex. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I had a little freak-out, but Linda helped me get through it. 
 This is Linda. This is my best friend Alex. 
 It's nice to meet you. 
 Linda : Nice to meet you. 
 Alex : Brett, why don't we get your clothes on, and head back home? 
 No. I know that sounds... no. 
 There's certain people there that are expecting your presence. 
 I mean, might be nice just to drop by, say hi. 
 (whispering) 
 Look what I got. 
 I think I'm weird. 
 What? 
 Will you still be my friend if I... get weird and just go? 
 Of course. Oh, yeah. 
 I just want to be me. 
 I don't want to be Brett. I want to be me. 
 Okay. 
 I think that's a great idea. 
 For the moment, just... maybe you should just sneak in the front door, go to your room, and just take a nap. 
 You're worried about me. 
 I... (laughs) Why would I be worried about you? 
 Because you should be worried about me. 
 No! Bouncy castle is closed! 
 Go! 
 Hey! Out of here! 
 Not now, Larry. 
 I was... I was just gonna say... 
 Yeah, I know what you're gonna say. 
 You're gonna say I don't need this. Right? 
 But actually I do. I need to be good at this. 
 So don't tell me to let it go. Because you know what? 
 You can understand what it's like to have nothing. 
 Are you finished? 
 No! 
 Okay. Then finish. 
 I do understand, you know? I get it. 
 I was hustling my ass off in this town as a broke PA for 11 years before I made something of myself. 
 And you know what? It doesn't mean a thing. 
 You know what means something? 
 This means something. 
 You're making this harder than it has to be. 
 So when you're ready, just call me. I'm here. 
 I'm ready to take care of you.

 Sure. 
 Are we good? 
 Are we, uh, good? 
 It's okay. 
 Michelle is very inspired by you, and I know you have a very deep connection. 
 And I'm pretty threatened by it. 
 But I think that's okay. 
 I just want to know if it ends there, or if I should be worried. 
 (making baby sounds) 
 I think Michelle is fantastic. 
 Excuse... I'll be right back, okay? 
 Brett : She's my favorite person on the planet, along with Alex, you know, and... and there's this horse I just met. 
 Oh. Hi, Brett. 
 Hi. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I came to the party to party. 
 Um, what... what are you wearing? 
 A robe. 
 All right. 
 Um, David, would you mind just giving us a second? 
 No. I think things seem to be wrapping up, so I'm going to grab the girls and help clean up. 
 Great. And... 
 Hey, man. 
 Michelle : Okay. 
 All right, come on. It's okay. 
 (laughs) 
 Michelle : Okay, it's all right. 
 All right. 
 (door slams) 
 I had a nice conversation with David. 
 I think he's a good guy. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 What... what do you mean? 
 I mean, why did you come to my party dressed like Obi-Wan Kenobi? 
 My clothes got wet, and I borrowed Linda's. 
 Are you drunk? 
 No. 
 I... I, uh, drank Scott's tea. 
 What? 
 Mushrooms. 
 Oh, you took mushrooms? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, so you just decided to show up to my party, which you know means a lot to me, on a mushroom... 
 I'm sorry... 
 A mushroom trip? 
 It was not something I planned on, it just happened. 
 It was a happy accident and I'm enjoying myself. 
 I tried something new and I like it. 
 What is going on with you? What is going on? 
 I had an amazing day. That's what's going on. 
 And I... from the looks of it, you had a great day out there. 
 I watched you at the party. You were having a great time until I showed up. 
 Why don't we just go do what we were doing before? 
 We need to talk about this. 
 Is that going to make your day more fun, if we sit in here and argue about it? 
 It's not... Not gonna make my day more fun. 
 Brett... I think if you go join your party, and I go read "Dune" in the bedroom and we just separate, it's gonna be better. 
 No. That's how people grow apart. 
 Okay. I know I had Scott's tea, but I know what I'm talking about. 
 And it seems very clear to me right now. 
 We're not good for each other right now. 
 It doesn't mean I don't love you, and it doesn't mean you don't love me. 
 I just can't fight right now. I'm having too good of a day. 
 And that's really rare for me. 
 Okay.
