 Mmm! 
 Mmm. 
 Come on. 
 Hi. Good morning. 
 Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 
 Did you say, "Uh-uh"? What... what's wrong? 
 Where... what's happening? 
 I thought... 
 Oh, dude. 
 So early. No. 
 Why are you... 
 Sorry, I thought I had a signal. Sorry. 
 All over me over here? 
 Sorry. 
 Sleep deprived right now. 
 Okay, sorry, my bad. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I misread that, sorry about that. I'm sorry. 
 That's okay. 
 Okay.

 Alex : Am I being evicted? 
 Where's all my sh1t? 
 Good Lord. 
 Brett, I'm getting evicted, literally right now. 
 I need some serious backup. 
 Hey! Hey! That's my stuff! 
 That's...  no es bueno! 
 Uh, get a U-Haul truck, something, I don't know. 
 I need help stat, all right? 
 I'm sorry to call so early. 
 I love you, dude. 
 All right buddy, let's get you all fixed up. 
 Come on! 
 I think we've had enough of those. 
 Please, I don't... don't give me a vegan lecture. 
 I don't want to hear about a food documentary, okay? 
 Let me just enjoy this right now. 
 I'm just trying to help. This is tough-love time. Give me the f*cking donuts. 
 You want the donuts? 
 Yeah, I want the donuts. 
 All right. 
 You can have them. 
 Thank... 
 You just did that right to my face. 
 [Muffled] Right in your face. 
 All right. 
 Those are my donuts! 
 Give me them! 
 Give it to me. Give me the bag of... all right, you see? 
 You're a mess. Look at me. 
 All right, you got a little bit right here. 
 Just a little bit. All right. 
 I'm sorry it came to that, but it's for your own good. 
 I love you. 
 It's over. 
 What's over? 
 I'm done. 
 You're done with what? 
 I'm going home. 
 You don't have a home. I have all your... 
 To my mom's house. 
 To Detroit? 
 Yeah. The acting thing is not happening, man. It's just... it's f*cked. 
 I'm fat. I'm getting bald. 
 I can't take the rejection anymore. 
 I can't take skinny, beautiful LA people looking at me like I'm a f*cking whale. 
 I don't think everybody thinks you're a whale, okay? 
 People look at me, man, they want to f*cking harpoon me. 
 Okay, this is a setback. We've had these. 
 We regroup, and we triumph. 
 That's what we do. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Let me just take you back to 1995. 
 Senior year, high school, "Jesus Christ Superstar." 
 You died on stage, you rose from the dead, and everybody in the audience f*cking wept. 
 You moved them, okay? 
 Do you know who wasn't weeping in that audience? 
 Billy Stayson. 
 He was sitting in the front row doing this... the whole time I was dying on the cross. 
 Why was he doing that? 
 Because I shared with him my dream. I was like, "Dude, I want to go out to Hollywood and become a star." Uh-huh. 
 And he said, "If you do that, you'll end up sucking dick on Hollywood and Vine." 
 [chuckling] Okay. 
 Back then, I thought he was an asshole. Mm-hmm. 
 But now, in retrospect? 
 He's a f*cking prophet. 
 Brett : All right, green smoothie time. 
 We'll set up the couch for you. 
 We're getting there. 
 All right. All right. 
 Um... 
 Why are you sitting in the driver's seat? 
 Can I have the keys, please? 
 No, you may not have the keys. 
 All my sh1t's packed up in a U-Haul, man. 
 What more of a sign do I need? 
 There's nothing for me here. 
 Look, you don't understand, okay? 
 I need you here. 
 I have to go to family day, and be at the beach, and pretend it's fun? 
 I don't think you understand. 
 I know that I'm the cog in the wheel that maybe makes beach day better for you... Yeah. 
 But I don't think you're seeing anything from my point of view right now. 
 Alex. 
 What do you want me to say, man? 
 I need, like... 
 I need a day from you, okay? 
 Will you give me, like, a day? 
 Just come to family day with us? 
 Sophie : Hi, Daddy! 
 Hi, Soph. 
 Michelle : Hi. Hi, guys. 
 Hi. 
 Alex, I'm so sorry about your apartment. 
 Oh, that's okay, I'm sorry I stole your husband again. 
 Michelle : That's okay. 
 Hi, Sophie! 
 Hiii! 
 Do you want to come help with this cooler or something, hon? 
 Yeah, of course. I'll be right there. 
 Please. Please, come on. 
 You got 24 hours. 
 Yeah! 
 Where is your sister, by the way? 
 Is she still at that guy's house? 
 Don't ask. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 So, um... what exactly is a Scarab boat? 
 Do you remember the, uh... the first season of "Miami Vice"? 
 Yeah. 
 That was a Chris Craft Stinger 390. 
 The second season, they started using a Wellcraft Scarab boat. 
 That's what I have. 
 That's awesome. 
 I'll take you out on it. 
 I mean, not today, but, you know, I'm racing today. 
 But some other time? 
 Seriously? 
 Yeah, that'd be great. 
 I would love that! 
 [Vacuuming] 
 We don't have anything like that in Houston. 
 I mean, we have lakes. 
 Here the weather's always good and there's just so much stuff to do. 
 [Vacuuming continues] 
 I've been thinking about making the... the move... the move out west. 
 I just need a change and... 
 I really need to expand my business. 
 What do you do? 
 I wholesale bounce houses. 
 Ah. 
 That'd be fun, right? 
 I mean, no pressure. 
 I'm just thinking about spending more time with my niece and nephew, and... you, of course. 
 Yeah, totally. 
 [Giggling] 
 So, what time are you going to come get me? 
 Of course, yeah. I'll... uh, I'll text you. 
 Come here, you. [chuckles] 
 [van honking] 
 Michelle : T.T. 
 Okay. Uh, bye. 
 That's my sister. 
 Hey. 
 All : Hi. 
 Michelle : Yo, let's go. 
 Okay. 
 Dude, I didn't know you were coming. That's so awesome. 
 What's up? 
 How are you? 
 What's happening? 
 I'm so psyched! The last time I saw you was the wedding. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Where you as drunk as I was? 
 No. No, I don't think anyone was as drunk as you were, actually. 
 I saw you... 
 I'm in my living room, and there you are, on my TV, doing a commercial for... 
 Heartburn. 
 You were so funny. 
 It wasn't supposed to be funny. 
 What happened to your hair? 
 Uh, I lost it? 
 Brett, can we put some music on? 
 What's up with the bad juju in this car? 
 Light rock, but loud. 
 He's having a bad day. It's fine. 
 Yeah, he's fine. 
 And once we get him in the ocean, the guy's going to be set. 
 He's like half-man, half-dolphin. 
 Hey, you know what I was thinking would be kind of nice? 
 What's that? 
 If we take Frank in the ocean, together, for his first time. 
 Just the two of us. 
 Yeah, that's a good idea. 
 Do you want to do that? 
 Totally, we should, yeah.

 Well, he's taking me to the airport, we're having dinner before, so it's... you know, it's, like, a fine line.

 You're having a f*cking... a fuckfest by yourself? 
 What is this? 
 I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay? 
 I thought maybe I would take a nap, I just... 
 Cause, you know, nap time is a little valuable. 
 I would've liked to have been working out while... 
 Okay, I'm sorry. 
 What... what are you... 
 You came in here, and I was reading and... 
 What are you fiddling with under the covers? 
 What are you... squirming, and you're playing with your boobs. 
 I don't... I'm not playing... I'm not... I just... 
 Clothespins? Why do you have clothespins on your boobs? 
 I don't know! 
 You know what? I've been depriving myself of the internet in hopes that we can make love at some point. 
 Come on! And you are... 
 You've not been depriving yourself of the internet.

 Don't talk to her like that.

 If you f*cking... don't touch me! 
 You don't have to walk me out the door!

 Do yourself a favor and don't shush me. 
 Will you calm down for just one second? 
 Whatever you do, don't shush me! 
 I will shush you! 
 No, I can't calm down!

 Oh.

 Something horrible did happen! 
 And I didn't have any... 
 He broke up with me! Did you not hear what I just said? 
 Okay. I didn't know that you guys were going out. 
 What did you think we were doing? 
 It was news to me. 
 What did you think we were doing?! 
 I thought you were hanging out and having... 
 You thought we were f*ck buddies? 
 The reason you think that is because you have no respect for me, you have no respect for my decisions... 
 Tina... and you don't take me seriously at all! 
 You don't even know what's going on with me, and you don't check in to find out. 
 Oh my God, I have been calling you every f*cking day and saying, "Hey, do you want to come have dinner?" I'm sorry that... 
 Do you want to tell me what's going on with you? ...you want to spend my entire future with your married, perfect, little nest of a family. 
 Oh yeah, it's so perfect. 
 Do you know what it's like to be dating at my age? 
 Okay. And to not have found anyone at my age? 
 Do you have any idea what it's like? 
 It's pathetic. 
 There's nobody left. 
 I'm just going to end up alone and a freak like Aunt Edie! 
 Oh! Oh, Tina. 
 f*ck, I can't believe it.

 Oh, honey. You're so beautiful. 
 You're so special. 
 I don't care. 
 You're not old.

 No, you're really not. 
 You're perfect. You have everything, I don't have anything, and I'm older than you. 
 Tina. 
 Listen. 
 Why don't you come out with us tonight? 
 What? 
 Come with me and Brett, come on date night with us. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 Please. 
 Honestly, it sounds like y'all really need your... 
 Nope. No. 
 I don't want to go. 
 What if I need you to go? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Everything's fine. 
 What's the matter? 
 I can't... 
 I was just discovered. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Okay, I was f*cking jerking off.
