 Cool. When we get back, we should all do something, the three of us. 
 Me, you, and Larry? 
 Yes. Y'all hit it off at the party. 
 Did we? 
 Yes! Y'all were talking about actors and movies. 
 Hmm. Yeah. 
 Anyway, thanks for coming to Houston with me. 
 I told you I'd come, and I'm here.

 It's a new way of parking the car. 
 You're gonna keep the car here?

 I'm gonna pay them for it. 
 Brett. 
 Yeah, I'm full of surprises tonight. 
 Okay.

 Brett : Oh. I think we're gonna have to fumigate. 
 Yeah. 
 It's Fart City, USA, in our living room. 
 It's crazy. 
 It's fun having everybody around. It's like a big soap opera. 
 I like it too. I just... I need to be able to go. 
 Yeah. 
 'Cause it's like, all day. 
 Yeah, you need to go out and go to a nice restaurant... 
 Exactly, thank you for doing this.

 Yeah. This place is great, right? 
 I really love it, and I'm so impressed that you found it, and... 
 I did my research. planned... 
 I looked online. You know, there's even, like, a hotel here. 
 Oh my god. 
 Yeah, it goes all the way up. 
 I bet it's so pretty. 
 We should plan an overnight trip. 
 We should put the kids with Peggy for the night, we should get a room and sleep in, and we can watch "The Bachelor" if you want. 
 I'll totally watch "The Bachelor" with you. 
 Would you? 
 And just be like we were, when we were, like, 28. 
 I think that would be awesome, all right? 
 That would be so fun. 
 Let's get our calendars out when we get home, I would love it. 
 And we'll just see, you know. 
 [Stammering] This... 
 For... tonight? 
 I told you I was full of surprises.

 He's really a very attractive man. 
 He's not nearly as heavy as... 
 Shh! 
 Mom!

 Honey, don't get started with that. 
 Honey, he doesn't mind. 
 No, I mean, stick your hand in there and really, really pull it.

 You need to wear gloves, honey. 
 Well, you really didn't have to do this, but thank you so much. 
 And it was very thoughtful. 
 Aww, well, after everything you've done for Kristina, I mean, that's the least we could do. 
 Oh. What did she tell you that I've done? 
 Nothing. 
 You're her support system and you're looking after her. 
 And we see that, and we know that. 
 Absolutely, absolutely. 
 And you, just adorable man.

 Michelle. 
 Hmm. Hi. 
 Hi, Tina. 
 Yeah, what's the matter? 
 I-I am in the bathroom... 
 What's going on? 
 Of a hotel right now that Brett brought me to. 
 I-I can't even hear you. 
 Why is it so loud? 
 Tina : It sounds like you're standing under a waterfall. 
 Yeah, I have the water on so he can't hear me talking to you. 
 Yeah, I can hear you. 
 What's the matter? 
 Tina, he wants to have s*x and I don't know what to do. 
 Honey, you gotta stop overthinking it, and you gotta stop talking about it and just get it done. 
 I-I... I can't. I don't know if I can. 
 Michelle : The whole situation seems insurmountable. 
 Get back in there, get your ass in the air, and f*ck your husband. 
 Okay, it-it's... it's very hard. 
 Look, if you have to suck his dick, go suck his dick. 
 Pretend he's somebody else. I don't care, but stop talking about it. 
 Stop calling me. Get off the phone right now, and get in there and do it. 
 Okay? And don't call me until you've done it. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay, I love you.

 You f*cking tell Brett and I will cut your balls off. 
 Great. 
 [Water running] 
 Hi. 
 Is it too much? 
 What? The... 
 Just the hotel, and the... 
 There's a lot of naked ladies on the wall. 
 There are so many naked ladies. 
 You know. 
 It's... 
 It's maybe... it's not your fault. 
 It's so nice, and so sweet, and I'm excited. 
 I... Listen, yeah, I just wanted this to be fun and... 
 It's so fun, it's so nice. It's perfect. 
 It doesn't... but I'm just saying it doesn't have... we don't have to have s*x. 
 We can take s*x off the table. 
 Let's just put it away, and let's have a nice, relaxing night. 
 There's a huge TV here. 
 I'm sure there are a ton of bad movies on it. 
 Let's just watch a movie. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. And we... that way we can just relax. 
 Oh, Brett. That sounds so nice. 
 All right. 
 Okay.

 I am. 
 What grade? 
 I teach kindergarten. 
 Oh my god, that's amazing. 
 Yeah, it's really fun. 
 I just get to play all day. 
 That's basically what I do. I'm unemployed. 
 You know, for the most part. 
 No, you're an actor. 
 Yeah, but I'm really unemployed. 
 Oh, no. I'm sure... I think... you're probably just being, like, modest or something. 
 Eh, maybe a little bit. 
 I'm having fun. 
 Me too.

 Shake it, Pam!

 Of all the things that brought you around, "Bio-Dome" is what get... is what gets you in the mood? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Um... 
 No, I just... 
 I think it's important. 
 I do too.

 I just feel like you're trying to pull my legs. 
 Sorry, can we just not talk about it? Can I... 
 Can we just not talk about it for a second? 
 I just wanna get in, like, a rhythm, if that's okay. Are you good? 
 Yeah. I mean, if you need something... like, we should do it. 
 But if you're... Okay.

 I'm 37 years old. 
 I can't have a boner 24/7. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. 
 Okay, listen. 
 I'm not asking for you to be... a steel rod...  
 It feels like you're asking that. 
 Uh, boner man. 
 I'm... I was just trying to be helpful. 
 Well, you know what? It's not helpful for me. 
 It's not a big deal. 
 No, it is to me. 
 It's a big deal to me. 
 Okay. 
 You're just getting defensive, and you're mad at me for... 
 Yes, I am mad at you, Michelle. 
 Why are... 
 Do you understand it's hard to get a rhythm going? 
 Like, I can't stop mid-fuck and have a meeting with you about whether this is the right angle or... 
 Jesus Christ, Brett! 
 I'm not trying to have a meeting. 
 I'm trying to have a conversation with my husband. 
 Can you loosen up a tiny bit? 
 Well, I gotta get a rhythm going! 
 Can I not voice one opinion without you freaking out? 
 Yes, you can voice your opinions, but it's kind of hard to get a rhythm going when we're having conversations. 
 Will you stop saying "rhythm going"? 
 I can't have an international peace treaty about the state of my boner in the middle of making love. It's crazy! 
 I was asking you if you were okay. I was trying to help. 
 Well, listen to me. 
 It's a little hard for me to loosen up when I look down at my wife, and her eyes look right back up at me. 
 And you know what they say? 
 They say that she is dreading having s*x with me. 
 That's not true. 
 Michelle, it is true, okay? And you know what? 
 It might be a surprise to you, but listen to this. 
 It's not that easy for me, either. 
 I'm not in love with having s*x with the same person after 10 years, okay? 
 I'm just trying to make it work. 
 I'm trying to get something functional. 
 I need a C+, and the routine... 
 Okay. Okay. 
 The thing that I get into, is what gets me through it. Do you understand that? 
 Okay. This is all great. Can you keep your voice down? 
 No, I... 'Cause people can hear you. 
 I don't give a f*ck who hears me, Michelle! 
 I don't care! I give a f*ck! 
 I care! 
 Clearly, you don't care about anything that I care about. 
 How dare you f*cking say that to me? 
 I do everything for you, and everything for the family. 
 I care too much about what everyone needs. 
 I'm holding the whole thing up, and the boner's just falling down, falling down. I'm holding it, and you can't f*ck at all. It's impossible! 
 That doesn't make any sense! It's absurd! 
 It's absurd! I cannot win. 
 It's absurd! It's f*cking crazy! 
 It's insane. 
 [Door slams] 
 Yeah, he's got like a joke. 
 All right, well, thank you for the dance. 
 Thank you, you... 
 Dance. 
 Good night. 
 Good night! 
 I mean it. That's it? 
 I gotta take him home 'cause he's drunk. 
 Thanks for the dance. See you later. 
 Okay? 
 Thanks for nothing. 
 Don't be like that. 
 Get on, now. 
 Hey, let's go. 
 See you guys tomorrow at lunch, yeah? 
 Oh, I was actually gonna hang out with Pam tonight. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh... 
 But we gotta do all the stuff we gotta do, remember? 
 You know, I can take him in the morning. 
 I can just drop him off at your place. It's fine, right? 
 Come on, cowboy. 
 We gotta get... we got a tight schedule. Okay? 
 We'll see you tomorrow at lunch. 
 All right. 
 Okay, come on. What are you doing? 
 Oh, wait. 
 You drive 'cause I'm drunk. 
 You're drunk, I know. 
 Just get in the car. 
 Oh, you're so sweet, you know that I'm drunk. 
 Get in the car. 
 Don't push me. 
 Watch your head. 
 Bye, love you guys! 
 Bye! Love you too! 
 Get home safe. 
 Hey, it was so nice to meet you. Yeah. 
 We're just gonna... 
 Yeah, it was great meeting you. 
 Yeah, it was really good. Maybe we'll see you soon.

 Close the door. 
 Bye, Pam, I love you! 
 [Sighing] 
 [door opening] 
 [scoffing] I am so sorry. 
 That was really... weird. 
 That was a momentary lapse, and please excuse that. 
 And I wish I could take that back, and not say those things. I'm sorry. 
 But you did say those things. 
 And... 
 I just wanna know if that is how you feel. 
 Is that really how you feel? 
 Kind of. 
 I don't know. 
 I seriously... I don't know what to do. 
 Would you wanna go talk to somebody with me? 
 I mean... 
 Sure. 
 You're in the crosswalk. 
 Really? 
 Who gives a sh1t? It's 2:00 in the morning. 
 Well, just... go back a bit. 
 The light's gonna change any second now. 
 What is the big deal? Just back up a little. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 No. 
 No? 
 Well... it's green. 
 I don't give a sh1t. 
 You know why? 
 'Cause you've been bossing me around this whole trip. 
 You've been bossing me around ever since I met you. 
 But you're not gonna tell me how to drive. 
 [Car honks] This is dangerous, you f*cking idiot. 
 That guy could have f*cking killed us! 
 And you don't get to call me names, and you don't get to tell me who I can sleep with. 
 What? 
 You heard me. 
 I don't tell you who you can sleep with. 
 Are... are you kidding me? 
 That was the biggest cockblock in the history of cockblocks back there. 
 [laughs] I'm not just gonna let you sleep with my friend. 
 Why not? 
 Because. 
 'Cause you're a bossy, cockblocking, control freak? 
 Because it's f*cking weird, dude. 
 What's weird about it? 
 It's weird because it's weird whenever you mix people with their friends. 
 How can you not know that? 
 The light is still green! 
 Oh my god, I didn't know that! 
 So we can go out together, and you can go home with Larry Kozinski, but I can't go home with Pam Watkins. 
 That is so different! 
 Um, Pam is my best friend! 
 No. If I can't sleep with Pam, then you shouldn't be able to sleep with Larry. 
 [laughing drunkenly] 
 Just... you know... You are so f*cked up, dude. 
 You are so f*cked up... 
 Don't talk to me. 
 That it's, like, kind of incredible. 
 Just don't talk to me the rest of the night. 
 Could you possibly go when it's a green light? 
 Oh, great. 
 It's a red now.

 You know what George Harrison's wife said when they asked her what the secret is to being married for so long? 
 No, I don't know what she said. 
 Don't get divorced. 
 I don't want to get divorced. 
 I don't wanna get divorced, either.
