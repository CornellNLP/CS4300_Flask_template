 Larry : Then don't go to the party. 
 Tina : Yeah, but because it's Alex's party, it's gonna seem weird if I just don't show up. 
 Then maybe you should go to the party? 
 But I don't wanna add any tension, you know, if he doesn't want me there. 
 Why don't you and I just do a drive-by, we'll run in and say hi to everybody, and then say we have to be somewhere else? 
 I got poker tonight, I can't go. 
 Can't you skip it? You do it every week. 
 Just this once? 
 I mean, Tom's gonna be there, and I... 
 Who the f*ck is Tom? 
 Tom Hanks. 
 Oh, him. 
 You know what, I don't even know why I would go to this stupid thing. 
 I'm gonna just have some popcorn, catch up on my TV, have a girls' night in with Sally. Right, Sally? 
 Larry : Sounds great. 
 What do you think? You and me. 
 We're gonna have some bonding time. 
 (dog groans) 
 She's really excited. 
 Michelle :  As you can see, 
 our fantastic architect, Louis... 
 (cheering) has drawn up the plans for the building remodel. 
 Thank you, Louis, yay! 
 So, in the meantime, what I really need your help with is with hiring, is with the curriculum, and it's also... with, um... outreach. 
 Um... 
 Sorry. 
 We just need to send the message that this is a racially and economically diverse school. 
 So, whatever you can do to... get the message out will be great. 
 What are you doing? 
 What, I just... 
 Two co-workers talking. 
 No. 
 It's okay, all right? 
 It looks weird. It looks weird. 
 It doesn't look like anything. 
 And I'm... 
 I just wanna touch base with you. I need to talk to you. 
 You haven't returned my texts. 
 I'm sorry if what happened... was difficult for you. I can see you're struggling. 
 But... I don't want to apologize for how I feel about you. 
 I don't want to apologize David... 
 For how I feel about you. 
 And I'm not gonna back away... 
 No. 
 Just because you're married. 
 I don't want to do this. 
 Let's just... 
 Let's just slow it down. 
 I'm sorry. 
 This doesn't... I... 
 It was a mistake. 
 It was my mistake. 
 It's... It's done. It's over. 
 Nothing else is gonna happen. 
 I... 
 You know I love you, right? 
 (sighs) 
 (sobs) 
 Please, just get out of here. Please, just get out of here. 
 Please. 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

 Brett : You ready? 
 Get 'er up, sister, Get 'er up. 
 Get that star. 
 Good. Nice. You wanna do one more? 
 Sophie : Yeah. 
 Nice. 
 Brett : Right, let's get some down here. 
 We need to fill this stuff out. 
 Alex loves his stars. 
 What about a little vampire face? 
 Vampire face? If you're going to do that, do that right there. 
 That looks... 
 Hi. 
 Hey. You're home. 
 Yup. I'm home. 
 Eww! Eww! 
 Excuse me. 
 Yeah. 
 Rude. Hello? 
 Why are you saying "eww"? 
 You're kissing Daddy like Belle kisses the Beast at the end of the movie. 
 Like this? 
 Ew! Weird! 
 (shouting) 
 Kisses, kisses! 
 (baby crying) 
 Uh-oh, I think Frankie needs kisses. 
 Oh, baby. 
 Aw. Here I come, sweet pea. 
 I got you, sweetheart. 
 Here we go. 
 There we go. There we go. 
 You're good, Frankie. Are you okay, Frankie? 
 You're good. 
 Woman on TV :  Because inside, it was all real. 
 Watch your show. Watch your show! 
 Maybe you'll learn something. 
 I was starting to feel like myself again. 
 I'm just not that into you. 
 Seriously. 
 You smell like a rat's asshole. Oh, my God. 
 No! Oh, my God. I said no! 
 Ugh.

 Hey.

 What?

 No, he's not here yet. We need to kind of... 
 He's like coming soon, so... 
 Oh, oh. 
 No, I just forgot something in my car. 
 Do I have...  Do I have time to go... 
 Yeah, go, but we should... 
 Oh, okay.

 Hey. 
 Yo. 
 Looking a little low over here. 
 Do you think he's gonna be a movie star? 
 Uh, he might be. 
 What... What are you... ? 
 That'd be just so weird. 
 Did I ever tell you about the time when he got his first big play? 
 When we were in high school? 
 Okay, so we were freshmen and this was when we were in our, like, severe soul mate phase. 
 Like, sleeping at each other's house every weekend, and dreaming about our futures, and... 
 Totally gay. 
 Well, I was gonna say "the happiest time of my life." 
 But, you know, whatever. It's fine. 
 Anyway, he got cast as the lead in the play, and it was this big deal 'cause a freshman had never been cast as a lead, and he f*cking... got cocky. 
 And he left me behind a little bit. 
 So, you know. 
 I... I get it. 
 You know what I mean? 
 Wait, you get what? 
 I get how you...  You know, you... 
 How you're feeling. 
 I don't... What? 
 You think he's leaving me behind? 
 No, I'm not saying that. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I'm just saying...  I'm not saying... 
 I'm just saying... 
 Guys, guys! Shh! 
 I think he's here. I see, like, a limo pulling up. 
 A limo? 
 Okay. 
 He's in a limo? 
 Brett : They just do that. It's not... 
 All : Surprise! 
 (laughing and cheering) 
 This is great! Oh my God, y'all, this is nuts! 
 Come in! 
 Tina : So, do you live in LA? 
 Christy : Oh, I don't. Not really. 
 What does "not really" mean? 
 Um, I don't really live anywhere, 'cause I just kind of, like, go wherever work is. 
 Like, um, I'm day playing on Alex's new show, so I was like, "okay." 
 (laughing) 
 You have a new show? 
 It's nothing. I'm just... 
 Holy sh1t! 
 It's a recurring role on a "WE" show. 
 When did this happen? 
 Well, I found out, like, three weeks ago, but, uh... 
 I'm playing a vampire. 
 (laughing) Wait, are you serious? 
 They're literally typecasting you already. 
 You're gonna be like a Russian vampire villain for the rest of your life. 
 No, he's Eastern European, and, uh, he's...  He's a somnambulist. 
 So, it's a little bit different, actually. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, I mean, the money's really good, so... 
 Great. Yeah, that sounds great. 
 Yeah. 
 That's so exciting. 
 So, you appear on the show? Or you... 
 No, I make sure everyone's dressed. 
 I whip everyone into shape. 
 Alex has trouble not being dressed in his trailer. 
 I do have that problem. 
 What do you do? 
 Um, it's just a bunch of stuff I've... 
 It's so complicated. 
 But what is it, though? 
 It's just some entrepreneurial stuff... 
 Oh, yeah. 
 That I've got in the works. 
 Oh, that's cool. 
 Hard to explain. 
 I love that. 
 I love that you're still just, like, "in it" at your age. That's awesome. 
 Yes, I am. 
 Christy : That's cool. 
 So, is this, like, the essence of the party? 
 Is this what we're doing? 
 We should play a movie game, right? 
 Yes! Let's do a movie game. 
 I'm so bad at party games. 
 Oh, no, it's not like a party game. 
 It's like, a get-to-know friendly game. 
 And it's super fast. I can teach you. 
 I'm gonna go have a drink. 
 Yeah. 
 You guys can wrangle everyone, 'cause I don't know everyone's names. 
 It'll be good. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Don't leave me... 
 Blink, blink, blink, blink, blink... (hisses) 
 What is that? 
 Are you kidding? 
 I just was like, "Wow. Rawr." 
 No, it was not "rawr." 
 No, definitely not. 
 (in craggy voice) I guess at my age, I just don't recognize these things anymore. 
 Christy : So, we'll go clockwise, and I will start us off with "A Clockwork Orange." 
 Wait, I don't... Is it... I don't know what to do? What do I do? 
 You name an actor or an actress in the movie. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Yeah, it's that guy. 
 It's that guy. What's-His-Balls? f*ck. 
 Um...  (giggling) 
 f*ck you, dude. 
 I don't think his name was "What's His Balls." 
 It's "What's-His-Balls Johnson." 
 (laughing) 
 It's fine. You can totally reject the first one if you don't know it. 
 Can we IMDB "What's-His-Balls"? 
 (laughing) 
 Well, that's rejected then. 
 Perfect, okay. 
 Um, how about... 
 "Forrest Gump." 
 Really? Tom Hanks. 
 Larry, my boyfriend, is with Tom right now. 
 All right, Phoebe, Tom Hanks to you. 
 Oh. Oh, "Splash." 
 Oh, yes, "Splash." 
 I like what you've done here. 
 Um, "Splash" has a lot, but I'm gonna give you John Candy. 
 "She's Having a Baby." 
 (gasps) Oh, my God. 
 Um... Woody Harrelson. 
 Um... "Wildcats." 
 Michelle : "Wildcats"? 
 You got this, sister. 
 Did you make that up? 
 I got this? No, I don't. 
 No, you know... 
 The lead actor that you used to have a crush on, he was in "Jungle Fever," his name rhymes with Leslie... 
 Cripes. 
 Leslie Nielsen? 
 Wesley Snipes. 
 (laughing) 
 You said Leslie Nielsen. 
 Never mind. Nobody heard it. 
 Uh, okay. So, Wesley Snipes to "Major League." 
 Ooh, "Major League." I like it. Okay. 
 Um... Corbin Bernsen. 
 Who? (laughing) 
 He was Roger Dorn, the third baseman. 
 Yeah, not helping. 
 I'll just give you a different one. 
 So, you said "Major League..." 
 No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. 
 Hey, you don't have to, like, change the rules of the game for me. 
 I'm a big girl. If I'm out, I'm out. 
 No, it's cool. No one wants to be the first person out. 
 No, I do. I wanna be out. 
 Trust me. 
 Why don't we just trade seats? 
 Why are we gonna trade seats? 
 'Cause I think the game will be easier if we just switch seats. 
 Why will the game be easier if we switch seats? 
 Um, 'cause I... 'cause like, the game is easier depending on who's giving you the clues. 
 Okay, let's switch seats. 
 Okay, perfect. 
 Perfect. 
 
 
 
 George...  George Carlin. 
 Oh, yes! 
 Oh, "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure." 
 Rufus. 
 Easy, you have Keanu Reeves. 
 Uh, "Point Break." 
 Patrick Swayze. 
 Patrick Swayze. 
 Jinx! Drink it! 
 (mutters) You better give me a f*cking easy one. 
 What? 
 It's your turn. 
 Oh. 
 Thought I heard...  Okay. 
 Um... okay. 
 "Dirty Dancing." 
 I have one, but it's so hard, I don't know if I want to do that to you. 
 Oh, no, go for it. Don't take it easy on me. 
 Are you sure? 
 I can take it. 
 Are you positive? 
 I'm a big girl. 
 Here it comes. 
 Okay. 
 Jennifer Grey. 
 Boo-yah! 
 Good luck finding another movie that she was in. 
 Um, this one's hard... 
 Pass? 
 Reject? 
 Or we could switch places? 
 'Cause sometimes it's easier if the person who's giving you the clues... 
 Bueller. 
 Huh? 
 Bueller? 
 No. 
 I said Bueller. 
 I know, but she wasn't... 
 As in, Yeah, I know what... "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." 
 She's not in that. 
 Yes, she is. 
 Jennifer Grey. 
 Yeah. 
 She totally has the best part. 
 She beats up Jeffrey Jones and then she hooks up with Charlie Sheen at the end. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Yes! 
 No, you know who that is? 
 It's What's-Her-Name from What's-His-Balls. 
 No, she's the mother in "Back to the Future." 
 Lea Thompson? 
 Look it up. 
 Yes! Lea Thomas. 
 No. I'm pretty sure it was definitely Jennifer Grey. 
 Tina : I am positive it's Lea Thompson. 
 It's Jennifer Grey. 
 You wanna bet? 
 No, I don't wanna bet you. 
 Guys, we're gonna go get a drink if anybody wants one. 
 Tina : You know it's Lea Thomas. 
 Okay, I bet you $1,000. 
 You got it. 
 Come on... escape. 
 Okay, great. 
 Look it...  Somebody look it up. 
 Look it up. 
 Do we have to? 
 Come on! Look it up. 
 Look it up. 
 (laughing) 
 Don't be sad. No hard feelings. 
 I said it was Jennifer Grey. No. 
 But now we know... 
 Brett : How long before Alex lights himself on fire in the fire pit? It's coming. 
 Michelle : Three... two, one. It's coming. 
 Welcome home, Alex! Happy party! 
 Why does she do this? Does she not know how horrible... 
 She can't help herself. 
 She gets into a thing and she's just like... gone. 
 It's just... 
 It's so bad. All right. 
 It's so crazy. 
 Well, I feel like, I'll run interference on Alex and Christy, and then you pull Tina away and... 
 No. 
 No.

 Like, no.
