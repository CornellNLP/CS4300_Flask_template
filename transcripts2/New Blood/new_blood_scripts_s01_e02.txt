 What have we got, then? 
 Suicide. 
 I don't think he jumped, sir. He was pushed. 
 Why did you want to be a policeman? 
 I don't want to be a policeman. I want to be a detective. 
 Two people are dead. 
 I might be coming to London. 
 Which station? 
 Canary Wharf. He'll be there. 
 You supporting someone, or are you here to have fun? 
 She's with me. 
 I came second. You came third. 
 I'd have come first if you hadn't got in my way. 
 No! 
 David Leese is taking backhanders. He must be. 
 UK Remicon are bribing him. 
 Shame we haven't got a shred of evidence. 
 I have three teams working on this. 
 You think I'll risk it all for your Batman and Robin antics? 
 UK Remicon, they're criminals. 
 They're protected. 
 They have some very powerful friends in government. 
 The trouble with the Serious Fraud Office is that once they get started, they don't stop. 
 You're in government. Can't you stop it?

 The pharmaceutical industry, a force for good, or a corrupt multibillion-pound profit machine? 
 With the NHS spending £15 billion a year on prescription drugs, urgent questions are being asked about the business practises of the world's biggest pharmaceutical giants. 
 We're going live now to Westminster, where the Commons' Select Committee, set up to investigate, are interviewing senior government advisor Peter Mayhew. 
 You authorised the multimillion-pound purchase of an anti-obesity drug, Lipocite. 
 Not personally, no. My role is only to advise. 
 But you advised that it was effective. 
 All the evidence suggests that it is. 
 But it's also three times the price of other drugs on the market. 
 A simpler, cheaper product is available from Ruhn Laboratories, for example. 
 Wouldn't it make more sense for them to be supplying the NHS? 
 Well, Ruhn Laboratories are an American firm, whereas Lipocite is made by a British company. 
 UK Remicon. 
 I think we should be proud that we're supporting them. 
 Lipocite acts on the brain. Is that correct? 
 As I understand, yes. 
 Is it dangerous? Does it have any side-effects? 
 It's been through all the usual trials. 
 That's not what I asked. 
 Well, there have been no negative results. 
 Oh! Henry! 
 What is it? 
 There was an accident. 
 A girl. 
 Where? What happened? 
 At the station. 
 S-S-She fell. 
 Was she hurt? 
 I ran away, Mum. 
 Henry, what have you done? 
 Is there something you need to tell me? 
 You don't need to be afraid. I'll look after you. 
 In travel news, Canary Wharf station has been closed by the police after a passenger fatality. 
 All other stations and lines are operating a good service. 
 Where is he?! 
 So, what have you got to say for yourself? 
 I was too late. 
 What are you talking about? Why did you go back to the school? 
 Well, I wanted to see her. 
 So you chased her here and she tripped on the escalators and broke her neck. 
 That's not what happened. 
 So, what did happen? 
 It can't have been an accident. She was killed, she was murdered. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. Like Mark Henson and Steve Mullen. 
 Steve Mullen? 
 He was in the photograph. 
 He was with them in India. 
 What do you think this is, some kind of conspiracy? 
 The only conspiracy is what you're doing in this job! 
 Just go home! 
 And what is this?! This stain up there?! 
 How is it possible to get a stain up there?! 
 Assured shorthold tenancy! 
 Don't you tell me about my contract! I know my contract! 
 Stefan, tell him! 
 Ohhhhh! Good evening, Mr Menakis. 
 What's the problem? 
 The problem? There are lots of problems! 
 You're meant to give us 24 hours' notice before you show up. 
 He just walked in. 
 Look at this place. It is my house. 
 It's a pigsty. I want you out! 
 You can't do that. 
 You can't threaten to put up the rent one minute, then throw us out the next. 
 You're behind with the rent. 
 No, we're not. 
 We pay on the last day of the month, every month. 
 Not last month, not the month before. 
 That... That's not true. Jan? 
 You held back the rent? 
 He didn't mend the toilet. 
 Wha...? You didn't pay the rent? 
 I didn't pay the rent! 
 Are you...?! 
 You'll have it by tomorrow lunchtime. I'll transfer it myself. 
 Why should I believe you? 
 All right. Lunchtime tomorrow. 
 And I still don't want you here! You have two weeks! 
 She was a teacher. 
 I only met her this morning. 
 Mm-hm! 
 They think it was my fault. 
 How can it be your fault? 
 It's complicated. 
 It's complicated, so they blame you? 
 I've heard that before. 
 Are you OK? 
 Yeah. I'm fine. 
 It's going to be fine. 
 Look, this might not be the right time, but, um... 
 I've got something for you. 
 I know you've been thinking about moving out, so this might cheer you up. 
 It's a room in a flat. 
 Yeah? 
 Yep. There's a girl that works at the hospital. Her name's Jo. 
 She's really nice, she's got a place in Wandsworth. 
 Better move quickly, though. Lots of people are interested. 
 Thanks. 
 Goodnight. 
 Sayyad! How you settling in? 
 First day, just the one dead witness. 
 Let's see, er... where we are by the end of the week, shall we? 
 Guv, I... 
 No, no. It's probably best you don't say too much right now. 
 Derek, why don't you take me through it? 
 Laura Jones knows Mark Henson. All right? 
 They go on holiday together. 
 Wonder Boy here wanted to know a bit more about that, so he decides to go back to the school. 
 Hm. And what happened? 
 We don't know. She got nervy, fell down the escalators. 
 Er... she didn't fall. She was pushed. 
 That your opinion? 
 Have we got anything from Pathology? 
 They're still working on it. 
 What are we saying, then, the two deaths are linked? 
 I'm not sure they are. 
 They have to be! 
 Look. This is Mark Henson, this is Laura Jones. 
 When did you get that? 
 Er... I saw it at the flat. 
 Flaxton Court. I went back this morning. 
 What, and you just took it? You can't do that! 
 You had it labelled and entered in the evidence log? 
 Yes, Guv. 
 Go on. 
 This is Mark Henson, Laura Jones and this is Steve Mullen. 
 I saw his picture in the collision report from Luton. 
 All three have been killed in the last four weeks. 
 You've been busy. 
 That picture was taken in India. 
 I think that's the Gate of India in Mumbai. 
 Wait a minute. What are you saying? 
 We've got some kind of serial killer hitting teachers? 
 I'm not saying anything, Derek. 
 It makes no sense to me, either. 
 What about this, er... CCTV footage from Canary Wharf? 
 Well, it won't be much help. 
 It was switched off in the ticket office. 
 Who by? 
 These two. 
 They came in and it seems they made straight for the main junction box. 
 Contract workers. All right, who are they? What were they doing there? 
 We're on to it. 
 That's where they pulled out the power supply. 
 I don't suppose you saw anything else? 
 Oh, it was over by the time I arrived. 
 All right. There are two other people in this photograph. 
 Assuming they haven't had their necks broken or been run over, we should find out who they are. 
 Right, then, genius, start with Steve Mullen. Get his widow in here. 
 Where'd you get this from? 
 I saw it in Leese's office. 
 Axis Hotel. 
 Sponsored by UK Remicon. 
 You should definitely make an appearance. 
 Get a copy of this printed up and use it at the front door. 
 OK? You can go as David Leese. 
 Will it count as overtime? 
 No. It's a party. 
 Then you go. 
 I can't. I don't like parties. 
 Everyone likes parties. 
 That's why it's not overtime. 
 Coleman. How nice to hear from you. 
 I have another assignment. 
 It's time to help the police with their enquiries. 
 Thank you for coming in today, Mrs Mullen. 
 And with your baby. 
 Have you found something? Do you know who killed Stephen? 
 Not... Not yet, no. 
 We've just got a few questions for you. 
 So, when did you move to Luton? 
 Just after we got married. 
 Five years ago. Dean's six months. 
 He's lovely. 
 Steve couldn't find any work up in Leeds, so we came south. 
 What job did he do? 
 He worked at a nursery. 
 Babies? 
 Flowers. 
 He was the manager. 
 He was on his way home when it happened. 
 Um... Jenny, can you tell me anything about India? 
 India? 
 Well, he went there. 
 Yeah. 
 He met some people out there, didn't he? 
 Um... there were a group of them, I think. 
 He never talked about it. 
 You don't know anyone in this photograph? 
 (That's Steve.) 
 I, um... I don't know the others, though. 
 Do you know how they met? 
 No. 
 But he got, um... He got paid for it. 
 He earned quite a bit of money. 
 How much money? 
 £600. 
 He used some of it to buy this ring. 
 What did he do to earn the money? 
 I don't know. 
 He didn't say. 
 So, what do you do in India to earn £600? 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know? That makes a change(!) 
 It was a waste of time bringing her in here. 
 She knew nobody in that bloody photograph. 
 If they knew Laura, if they were still friends, then maybe they'll come to her funeral. 
 That's possible. 
 Have another word with Luton Collision Unit investigators, see if they've got anything else. 
 Right, Sarge. 
 And you may have to dig out a black tie. 
 Good evening, Alison. 
 You frightened me! 
 Oh. 
 What are you doing here?! 
 Well, I came to see you. 
 You could have let me know. 
 I brought a rather pleasant Pouilly-Fume. 
 Would you like a glass? 
 Uncle Peter, I really don't think you should just walk in here. 
 I know it's your flat... 
 Oh, it's your flat, my dear. 
 I'm glad to give you the use of it. 
 I know how hard it is for young professionals in London. 
 House prices are ridiculous. 
 What do you want? 
 I just wondered if you had any more news for me about UK Remicon. 
 The situation is rather fluid at the moment, so, er... I like to be informed. 
 I'm trying, but I don't like this, Uncle Peter. 
 They'd fire me if they knew I was talking to you. 
 Hm! We're all on the same side, really. 
 Successful British company, 37,000 jobs. 
 We wouldn't want to lose all that. 
 I don't... 
 Any more than you would want to lose this flat. 
 Cheers. 
 Hi! Um... is that Jo? 
 My name's Arrash. My sister, Leila, gave me your number. 
 She said you had a room. 
 Er... yeah. Can I, um... Can I come and see it? 
 Er... tomorrow, 9:15. 
 I finish work at 7:00, so that's perfect. 
 I'll see you tomorrow night. Huh! OK. 
 Hi! 
 Hey! 
 Oh! Thanks. 
 Um... 
 So, what happened to your brother? 
 What? 
 You said he was coming with his girlfriend. 
 Oh, yes. Er... he, um... he let me down at the last minute. 
 You don't mind, do you? 
 No. Not at all. 
 So, how did you get into the SFO? 
 Well, I met Marcus and he hired me. 
 Hm. 
 You and Marcus, you're always out of the office. 
 What is it you do, exactly? 
 Same as you. 
 So, you're working on UK Remicon, then? 
 Um... 
 Well, yeah. 
 You were talking about a party. 
 Yeah. I'm going tomorrow night. 
 Why are you so interested? 
 Huh! I'm interested in you. 
 Mm! Would you like another drink? 
 Not really. 
 Oh, go on. I've got another bottle. 
 No, no, I've got an early start. 
 Oh, yeah, me, too. 
 We could... get up together. 
 Um... 
 I'm really flattered, but, you know, we work together. 
 No... No offence. 
 No. 
 Look, thanks for dinner. 
 (sh1t!) 
 So, the funeral's tomorrow? 
 Yes, Mr Blake. 
 And you know what to do. 
 Yes. 
 I don't really understand. 
 Let me be honest with you, Bruce. 
 Sometimes, the less you know, the better it is for you. 
 I don't want anyone to get hurt. 
 When I first joined Ruhn Laboratories, we were working on a new cancer drug. 
 It tackled chronic myeloid leukaemia, and it worked. 
 We covered all our research costs in just two years. 
 But that didn't stop us charging patients 90,000 a year just to take the drug. 
 And by the time I became CEO here in the UK, we were earning 900 million a year. 
 Pure profit. 
 Now... Well, you tell me, Bruce -- were we hurting those patients, or were we saving them? 
 Do you believe in God, then? 
 Er... not really. 
 Are you a Muslim? 
 I'm not anything. 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 
 It's all crap, the whole lot of it. 
 My condolences. 
 Ahem! 
 Over there. 
 What? 
 From the photograph. 
 Shall I tell you something, Sayyad? 
 No-one likes anybody who's right all the time. 
 You don't like me, anyway. 
 Oh, that's true. 
 We therefore commit Laura's body to the ground. 
 Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 
 In the sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life. 
 Excuse me. I wonder if we could have a word with you. 
 I'm Detective Sergeant Sands, this is DC Sayyad. 
 Is this about Laura? 
 Well, yes. 
 Unless you know anybody else here who's fallen down the escalators, I'd say that was a fair assumption. 
 Shall we go inside? 
 Why? 
 Just for a few minutes, so we can talk. 
 Well, that seems to have worked. 
 So, what's your name? 
 Bruce Lockwood. 
 Didn't you know that? 
 If you don't know who I am, why do you want to talk to me? 
 Can you identify any of the people in this photograph? 
 That's Laura. 
 Laura Jones. 
 Mark Henson. 
 Steve Mullen. 
 They're all dead. 
 Since when? 
 In the last four weeks. 
 Does that mean anything to you? 
 No. 
 I hadn't seen them. 
 Who's the other one? 
 I don't know much about her. 
 She went home. Somewhere in India, I think. I never saw her again. 
 What about Laura? 
 How well did you know her? 
 We all met in Mumbai. 
 In India. 
 We know where Mumbai is! 
 There were six of us. We were travelling at the time. 
 I only count five. 
 The sixth was a man called Henry Williams. 
 He's living in London. 
 He wasn't part of the group when this was taken. 
 Why not? 
 None of us really got on with him. 
 And then he got ill. 
 Tell me about Mumbai. 
 We were travellers. Students, backpackers. 
 We didn't have any money and so we answered this advertisement. 
 There were always leaflets, hawkers in the street, offering this sort of thing. 
 What sort of thing? 
 Testing. 
 It was an antidepressant and they needed volunteers. 
 So we all went to this hospital. 
 So, you had this untested drug injected into you? 
 They said it was safe. 
 And it was a respectable company. 
 What were they called? 
 Greenfern. 
 It was run by a guy called David Leese. 
 It was his name on the cheques. 
 Any idea where we can find him? 
 I think he works for the NHS. 
 So, what happened? 
 Nothing happened. 
 We were there for 24 hours, they paid us, they made us sign confidentiality clauses and we left. 
 Paid you how much? 
 £600. 
 I'm asking him, not you! 
 He's right, that's how much it was. 
 Did you all go back to Mumbai? 
 No, not all of us. 
 We never saw Henry again. 
 But I didn't mind. He was a weird guy, anyway. 
 Weird in what way? 
 I think he'd been out there too long. 
 A place like India, it does your head in after a while. 
 I'm going to need to take your contact details. 
 Thank you very much, Mr Lockwood. We'll be in touch. 
 Henry Williams. He was weird, he was ill. 
 We need to find him. 
 There must be a thousand Henry Williams in London. 
 OK, we'll start with the man in charge, David Leese. 
 We know he works for the NHS. 
 He shouldn't be too hard to find. 
 Enjoy the party. 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 Name? 
 David Leese. 
 Have a good evening, sir. 
 He's here. 
 Yes, um... my name's Detective Constable Arrash Sayyad. 
 I wonder if you can help me. 
 I'm looking for a man called David Leese. 
 Hello. I'm Gail Meadows. 
 And I know the importance of keeping myself in shape. 
 But can you believe a year ago, I looked like this? 
 Yes, that's me. 
 I tried everything, every fad diet, but nothing worked. 
 And then my doctor recommended Lipocite.

 'And I hope you have a very enjoyable evening.' 
 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is James Deakin. 
 Don't worry, I'll keep this short. 
 I know many of you have been asking about our highly sought after training courses. 
 As a matter of fact, we have one coming up very soon in the south of France so please do ask me or any of my staff about that. 
 Above all, we want to get to know you better. 
 And finally, I'd like to announce that, thanks to you, Lipocite has become our most successful product ever. 
 Have a great evening. 
 Come on... 
 Come on. 
 Where are you? Where are you? 
 Hey, can you tell Mum I won't be home for dinner? 
 I'm working late... and then I'm seeing Jo. 
 'Who's Jo?' 
 Your friend, about the flat? 
 'Yeah, fine. Whatever.' 
 Yeah. Thanks. 
 'Bye.' 
 I'm afraid he's not here. 
 Do you know where I might find him? 
 Who did you say you were? 
 I'm the police. 
 Er, Greenfern, have you heard of it? 
 No. He's never mentioned it. 
 In India? 
 No. 
 Look it's... It's important. 
 He went to a party. 
 It's at the Axis Hotel in the City. 
 I can call him if you like. 
 Actually, I... 
 I'd prefer it if you didn't. 
 Hi. I'm Lucy. 
 Hi. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm David. 
 I've never seen you at one of these before. 
 Yeah, it's my first time. 
 So what happens? 
 It's fun. You enjoy yourself. 
 And if you get bored down here, you can always go upstairs...? 
 There are rooms, lots of rooms... if you want to lie down...? 
 I'll see you around, David. 
 Take it easy. 
 You're empty. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't tell anyone, but this is Cristal. 
 We've got a few glasses doing the rounds. 
 Cheers. 
 We've not met before. 
 I work at the City of London Health Trust. 
 Pharmacist? 
 That's right. 
 So you know our products. 
 Of course. 
 Which ones in particular? 
 Amoxicillin, Sumatriptan, Paroxetine, Gleamers toothpaste, Hexham's Fruit Juice. 
 That's just a few. 
 That's very good. 
 Have some more champagne. 
 Thank you. 
 I don't think you told me your name. 
 It's... 
 I asked you your name. 
 It's, er... 
 Are you feeling OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, it was nice to meet you. 
 Have a great evening. 
 Have a great evening. 
 Who are you? 
 'Lipocite works up here, in the CB1 receptors in the brain. 
 'Ask your doctor about Lipocite.' 
 What's wrong with you? 
 What? 
 Jesus! 
 Wh...? 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Look. 
 What exactly are you on? 
 I don't know what I'm on. 
 You must know. What...? 
 What is it, ket? Crystal? GHB? 
 Cristal. 
 OK, er, did you snort or swallow? 
 No. You don't understand. 
 It was in the Cristal! 
 OK... 
 Just have some more juice. 
 I don't... I don't feel very well. 
 All right, well, you're not going to be sick, are you? 
 Oi. 
 Tell me you're not going to be sick! 
 Why did you have to do that? That is disgusting, man. 
 That's horrible. 
 I know you! 
 Look, I'm meant to be going to someone's flat. 
 I can't go like this. 
 We've met. 
 I've had enough of this, all right? I'm getting you to hospital. 
 Not hospital. Don't need it. 
 Of course you need it. Look at you. You're a mess. 
 YOU'RE a mess. 
 Thanks to you. 
 Not hospital. Don't want to go to a hospital. 
 OK. Where do you live? 
 Er... 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Bad. 
 I'm not surprised. 
 Where am I? 
 Rash brought you home. 
 Rash? 
 Arrash. My brother. 
 He's a police officer. 
 You're not serious. 
 I am. 
 Oh... God. 
 Do you remember anything about last night? 
 Not much. 
 Were you there? 
 No. 
 I looked after you when I got back from my shift. 
 I'm a nurse. 
 You were at the race. 
 I was. 
 You didn't win. 
 Close second. 
 Do you know what you took? 
 No. 
 And I didn't take it on purpose. 
 Hm, haven't heard that one before. 
 Would you like me to examine you? 
 Yes! 
 Y-yeah. Yeah. 
 All right, we'll start with your pulse. 
 Were you sick? 
 I think so. 
 Well, that's good. 
 Your pupils aren't dilated. 
 It's probably out of your system. 
 You should see a doctor anyway. 
 I'd prefer to see you. 
 Seriously... you should get checked over. 
 How's my pulse? 
 It's racing. 
 What's happening? 
 I was just... checking him. 
 All right. Is he well enough to leave? 
 I'm all right. 
 I'll leave you to it. 
 I should get to bed. 
 Thank you. 
 You look after yourself. 
 Here. 
 That should be your size. 
 What happened to this one? 
 You tore it off. 
 I'm Superman! 
 You said you were Superman. Or do you not remember that? 
 No. No. 
 Thanks. 
 Don't mention it. 
 You just ruined my evening. 
 No, forget it, mate. 
 I wasn't on drugs, if it makes any difference. 
 What? 
 I know that's what it looks like, but that's not how it happened. 
 I was drugged. 
 You're empty. 
 What? You mean... 
 Someone spiked my drink. 
 You can check me out if you like. 
 I work for the Serious Fraud Office. 
 Is that why you were there? 
 At the hotel? 
 I can't tell you that. 
 Why not? 
 You know I almost got killed because of you. 
 You're a police officer. 
 Who told you that? 
 Your sister. 
 Look, I can't talk about my work. I'm sorry. I can't. 
 I'm Arrash. 
 Arrash Sayyad. 
 Stefan Kowolski. 
 So why were you there? 
 I can't tell you that, either. 
 Then it looks like we don't have much to talk about. 
 You're right. We don't. 
 Eleanor. 
 Peter. 
 This is a surprise. 
 Is it? 
 I just happened to be passing. 
 You never just "happen" to be doing anything, Peter. 
 How can I help you? 
 Well, it's none of my business, but since you ask, I heard a whisper that you might be interested in a company with which I have certain connections. 
 UK Remicon? 
 You're right. 
 You're interested in them. 
 It is none of your business. 
 Well, of course, I wouldn't dream of interfering. 
 But I do hope you know what you're doing. 
 It is my habit, yes. 
 Then I'm sure you're aware of UK Remicon's track record. 
 They're a major player. 
 An exporter, an employer. 
 And, of course, we've got Ruhn Laboratories, waiting in the wings. 
 It'd be a shame to hand everything to the Americans, wouldn't it? 
 Peter... 
 Can I say something with the upmost respect? 
 Yes. 
 f*ck off. 
 So, you went to the funeral? 
 Yes, sir. 
 And the police were there? 
 Yes. Two of them. 
 One was a DS Sands. 
 The other one was younger. 
 DC Sayyad. 
 And you managed to tell them the things we mentioned? 
 Yes. 
 But... they said there were two others who'd died. 
 I know nothing about that. 
 Look, why are we doing this? Involving the police? 
 Are you concerned? 
 Yes, sir. I am. 
 What we're doing, Bruce, is... exploiting a situation that was handed to us. 
 It was handed to us by you, and we're very grateful for that. 
 I know, but... 
 UK Remicon's our number one competitor in the European market and if for some reason they were to be put out of the way, that could be very advantageous to us. 
 I just wouldn't want to think that we were doing anything... 
 Illegal? 
 Well... you signed a confidentiality agreement when you did that business with Greenfern, and you broke it. 
 But, er, you don't need to worry about that. 
 We'll look after you. 
 We've upgraded your company car. 
 It's parked out back. 
 I think you'll like it. 
 I don't know why you're asking me these questions. 
 Why is this even a police matter? 
 I'll tell you why, Dr Leese. 
 Mark Henson, Laura Jones and Steve Mullen are all dead. 
 All killed in unusual circumstances. 
 You used the three of them in some sort of medical experiment in India. 
 That's what connects them. 
 I didn't use them and it wasn't an experiment. 
 I wouldn't use that sort of terminology. 
 What we're talking about is a fully authorised and legitimate medical trial. 
 You knew them. 
 No. I headed up a company, Greenfern, which provided research facilities of the nature you have described. 
 We had hundreds of volunteers passing through. 
 I actually met very few of them. 
 Does the name Henry Williams mean anything to you? 
 No, I can't say that it does. 
 And when was the last time you saw Mark Henson, Laura Jones or Steve Mullen? 
 I'm not sure I ever saw them. 
 They're just names. 
 I went there as David Leese. 
 I got there before him, they didn't even ask for the invitation. 
 They knew I was coming. 
 They were expecting me. 
 That's not possible... 
 They wouldn't try something like that if they knew you were SFO. 
 So, what exactly did happen? 
 There were girls. 
 There were rooms upstairs. 
 There were training courses in the South of France. 
 If they're coercing the doctors and pharmacists with bribery, corruption and the rest of it, then... we've nailed them. 
 I didn't see anything. I wasn't there long enough. 
 It was like it was all set up. 
 The drink, the Cristal. 
 They were waiting for me. 
 But no-one else knew about this except for me and you. 
 And I didn't say anything. 
 So, how did they know? 
 Marcus, I could have been killed. 
 Yes? 
 Mrs Williams? 
 Yes. 
 I wonder if Henry is in? 
 No. 
 What's this about? 
 Can I come in for a moment? 
 I'm afraid we've had a complaint from the manager of the car wash where Henry was employed. 
 Tom phoned you? 
 It seems that Henry may have committed criminal damage. 
 He smashed a car window. 
 He lost his temper. He didn't know what he was doing! 
 Are you sure he's not here, Mrs Williams? 
 Could I take a quick look upstairs? 
 If you want to. 
 Between you and me, you've got nothing to worry about. 
 I'm sure they won't press charges. 
 Er, hi, Jo? 
 Er, this is Arrash, Leila's brother. 
 Yeah, I was supposed to see the room last night. 
 I got caught up. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 Yeah, I can come round today, if you like? 
 Any time that suits? 
 What, already? 
 Well, er, if they change their mind, then... 
 David Leese works for the City of London Health Trust. 
 He's the one who hired them. 
 Mark Henson, Laura Jones, Steve Mullen. 
 Is he the one killing them? 
 No. He's not got it in him. He's just a pen-pusher. 
 It's this Henry Williams we need to find, but all we've got is the name. 
 What about these two women at the station? The contract workers. 
 Still trying to find them. 
 So far, nothing. 
 You think they could be part of this? 
 The cameras were switched off. That's not easy. 
 We don't know it was them. 
 I've found Henry Williams. 
 Sayyad, there must be 400 Henry Williamses listed in London. 
 That's 400 addresses. 400 telephone numbers. 
 How have you managed that in just one morning? 
 I Googled him. 
 There's a company called Squeegees. 
 They're a car wash. 
 They have an online newsletter and, er, they write about their staff. 
 How do you know it's the right Henry Williams? 
 This is his picture. 
 So? 
 Well, I went back over the CCTV. 
 This is the entrance to the station where Laura Jones was killed. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Erm... 
 I found something interesting on Elizabeth Leese, David Leese's wife. 
 She used to work for a company that was owned by UK Remicon. 
 That's where she met her husband. He was CEO. 
 Greenfern? 
 Sorry about that, I had to take a call. 
 But you're right, he's not here. 
 Don't mention this to Henry, Mrs Williams. 
 There's no need to upset him unnecessarily. 
 He was only here for three months and, to be honest, I was glad to see the back of him. 
 Did you fire him? 
 I didn't need to. 
 In the end, he had a sort of a breakdown. 
 I haven't seen him since. 
 Are you saying he was off his nut? 
 I wouldn't use that language. 
 But he wasn't all together? Up there. 
 I would say he certainly needed help. 
 You have his address? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 So, what is it? 
 Greenfern was based in India. 
 It was R&D, testing new drugs. 
 So, this is the smoking gun. 
 This is what links David Leese to UK Remicon. 
 It would do, except Greenfern was closed down six years ago. 
 There is one bit of Greenfern that's still operating. 
 They call themselves GCS, but that's just a disguise. 
 It stands for Greenfern Consultancy Services. 
 They're still making payments every month to one person. 
 Who's Henry Williams? 
 I'm sorry. He's not in. 
 What did you say this was all about? 
 I'm not sure I did say, Mrs Williams. 
 We just want to talk to him. 
 That's all. 
 I... Is he in some sort of trouble? 
 Now, why would you think that? 
 I wouldn't. 
 Henry's always been a very quiet sort of boy. 
 But... you said you're the police. 
 And he's, what? 28, 29? 
 Hardly a boy. 
 Where is he now? 
 I don't know. 
 He went out to get the shopping. 
 Mrs Williams. 
 Can you tell me where Henry was three nights ago around 6:40? 
 Three nights ago? 
 Monday? 
 Monday? Well, he was, he was here with me. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 Yes. I'm sure he didn't go out. 
 Then... how would you explain this photograph? 
 It was taken on Monday just before 6:40, at a tube station the other side of London. 
 Is that Henry? 
 You tell me. 
 Well, it looks like him. 
 But it can't be. He was with me. 
 Does the name Laura Jones mean anything to you? 
 No. 
 Or Mark Henson? 
 Or Steve Mullen? 
 No. 
 What is this about? 
 I wonder if we can take a look at Henry's room? 
 How does he afford all this stuff? 
 Well, well, well. 
 I don't understand. 
 He was in India with Mark Henson, and all the rest of them. 
 He's a nutter. 
 It's not rocket science. 
 That could be him. 
 Why would he ring his own doorbell? 
 I'll go down. 
 It's all right, Mrs Williams. I'll get it. 
 Stefan. 
 Rash. 
 Henry! 
 Stop! 
 Henry! Henry, stop! 
 Henry! 
 Bruce Lockwood. We should talk to him. 
 You and me? 
 This has got nothing to do with me! 
 Three people are dead. You could be next. 
 Henry Williams has confessed. 
 You're not stupid, but you've overreached yourself, son. 
 Get out. You've brought this on yourself. 
 Can't you see the both of us are getting the same thing? 
 Rash? 
 Missing you already!
