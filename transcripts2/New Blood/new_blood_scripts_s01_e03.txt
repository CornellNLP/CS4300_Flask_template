 Stefan. 
 Rash. 
 Henry! 
 This is Mark Henson... 
 Laura Jones -- and this is Steve Mullen. 
 All three have been killed in the last four weeks. 
 You used the three of them in some sort of medical experiment in India. 
 That's what connects them. 
 Lipocite has now become UK Remicon's most successful product ever. 
 I went there as David Leese. 
 They knew I was coming. 
 They were expecting me. 
 So, this is the smoking gun. 
 This is what links David Leese to UK Remicon. 
 UK Remicon's our number one competitor in the European market. 
 If they were to be put out of the way, that could be very advantageous to us. 
 Coleman! 
 I have another assignment. 
 Police! Henry, stop! 
 Stop! 
 What the hell are you doing?! 
 What are you doing?! Get out the way, he's my suspect! 
 Get out of MY way! 
 Whoa! Whoa, whoa! 
 Don't hurt me. Please, just don't hurt me. 
 It's OK. 
 No-one's going to hurt you, Henry. 
 All right? 
 You just... stay there. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I came looking for him. 
 Why? 
 I can't tell you that. 
 Yes, you can. 
 It's about money. It's about fraud. 
 It's my job. OK? 
 What's happening? 
 We'll be with you in a minute. 
 You can't talk to him. 
 Why not? 
 Because I'm about to arrest him. 
 Look, my boss is here, all right? 
 He can't see you. 
 I'm taking him in, and we can sort this out tomorrow. 
 I'll meet you. 
 But I was the one who caught him. 
 Well, that's not true! 
 We both caught him. 
 I was the one who saw him! 
 That's not relevant. 
 What are you doing in my life?

 Why are you interested in Henry Williams? 
 I told you... 
 I can't talk about my work. 
 Oh, that's ridiculous. 
 Look, you were at that hotel because of a man called David Leese. 
 Can't you see that we're both investigating the same thing? 
 How can you eat all that? 
 What? 
 That crap. 
 It's breakfast! 
 Fine. 
 I'll tell you what I know if you tell me what you know. 
 OK. 
 You go first. 
 No. I invited you here. 
 And I paid! 
 If you tell my bosses... 
 I told you anything, I'll get killed. 
 Same. 
 All right, but this is just between you and me. All right? 
 Right. 
 The SFO are investigating a company called UK Remicon. 
 It's huge. It makes pharmaceutical products. 
 And? 
 Well, it's bribing doctors and pharmacists to promote their products. 
 Selling to the NHS at over-inflated prices. 
 One of those doctors is David Leese, and David Leese is somehow linked to Henry Williams. 
 Now it's your turn. 
 Henry is, er... 
 He's connected to the murder of three people. 
 Two teachers and a guy that worked at a gardening centre. 
 They all took part in some sort of experiment. In India. 
 Was that for a company called Greenfern? 
 Yes! 
 Well, do you know what drug? 
 Er, an antidepressant. 
 Name? 
 We don't know. 
 David Leese was CEO of Greenfern! 
 I know -- and Greenfern paid everyone who took part... 
 £600. 
 Yes! 
 Your sister, Leila. Does she have a boyfriend? 
 That's... not a question. That's got nothing to do with this. 
 Sorry. 
 Don't even go there! 
 OK... 
 What about Henry Williams? 
 He's our number one suspect. 
 He was there when one of the teachers fell to their death. 
 I actually saw him at the station. 
 Do you know he was being paid £20,000 a year? 
 No, but that makes sense. 
 He was definitely getting money from somewhere. 
 Who was paying it? 
 Greenfern. 
 Why did you go to the station, Henry? 
 I didn't. 
 We have you on CCTV. Why were you there? 
 I went to meet someone. 
 Laura Jones. 
 No. 
 Then who? 
 Caroline. 
 Who's Caroline? 
 Who is she? 
 She's my friend. 
 The one you talk to on the computer? 
 We've looked at your computer, Henry. 
 You were using an encrypted communication platform. 
 But we couldn't find an account at the other end, which means either they deleted it, or they didn't exist in the first place. 
 I think Caroline's a figment of your imagination. 
 She's real. 
 So, you met her at the station? 
 Well... 
 She said she was going to come, but she didn't. 
 No, Henry. Why don't you admit it? 
 You went there to meet Laura. 
 Henry didn't used to be like this. 
 He was a sweet little boy. He did well at school. 
 Then his father walked out, and it all started to go wrong. 
 I couldn't control him. 
 He fell in with the wrong crowd drugs, drinking all the time. 
 I just watched him. There was nothing I could do. 
 So what happened in India? 
 There was some sort of test. 
 I never wanted him to go to India. I knew it was a bad idea! 
 So, what happened? 
 I don't know very much about it -- only what Henry told me. 
 There was a... There was a hospital. 
 That's where they all met. 
 Most of us won't even get the real stuff. 
 They just give you an injection, then you lie down for a few of hours. 
 It was something to do with depression. 
 It was meant to make them all feel cheerful. 
 Are you saying that this drug, this -- whatever they injected into him -- made him ill? 
 He was already ill! He was an addict! 
 But it made him worse. 
 Put it down! 
 Greenfern looked after him. 
 That was the name of the company... but they didn't allow him to leave India for a while, and when he did come home he couldn't look after himself. 
 He moved back in to live with me. 
 You've tried to look after him. 
 I HAVE looked after him! 
 Whatever you think, whatever you're saying, you're wrong. 
 You went and found them one by one, didn't you? 
 You pushed Mark Henson off a roof... Laura Jones down the escalators... 
 No. 
 You ran over Steve Mullen in your car. 
 No. 
 Yes, Henry. 
 Why? 
 Was it something they did in India? Is that why you wanted to kill them? 
 I didn't! You... You, er... 
 I didn't, I didn't, I didn't... 
 I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't... 
 I didn't... 
 I didn't, I didn't... 
 I didn't, I didn't... 
 Don't worry. 
 Don't worry, Henry. 
 You're going to be all right. 
 'It's not going to be all right for Henry, is it?' 
 Henry is going to jail. Or maybe to Broadmoor. 
 And what exactly do you think you were doing, putting your hand on him?! 
 Don't you know anything about physical contact during an interrogation? 
 He had his brief in there! 
 He could do you for assault! 
 w*nk*r. 
 UK Remicon had a subsidiary in India called Greenfern, and Greenfern was run by David Leese? 
 Yes. 
 It's the link we've been looking for. 
 It connects him 100% with UK Remicon. 
 And what does Greenfern do? 
 It was a clinic primarily involved in developing and testing of new drugs. 
 And one of the volunteers, Henry Williams, has just been arrested by the police following how many murders? 
 Three. 
 Three! 
 Henry is still being paid by Greenfern. 
 They don't want anyone to know what happened. 
 All right. Let's stop there. 
 We cannot move forward with this case while it's a subject of a police investigation. 
 But we've put in months of work. 
 I know, and if you recall, I had my doubts about pursuing Leese in the first place -- now we're involved in murder investigation, for God's sake! 
 But Leese can still get us into UK Remicon. 
 No, Stefan. 
 Right now you can't go anywhere near David Leese. 
 It is a police matter. 
 You're off the case. Both of you! 
 'William Ashton, chairman of pharmaceutical giant UK Remicon, was today forced to issue a statement following the police arrest of 30-year-old Henry Williams on suspicion of murder.' 
 'Henry Williams volunteered for one of the test programmes. Unfortunately he was a habitual drug user. He'd lied on his application form. Due to a combination of different elements in his blood stream, he did suffer some sort of episode.' 
 'What was the drug being tested?' 
 'It was called Stenokoritin. It's an antidepressant. For reasons unconnected with the test, it never went into commercial production. Thank you very much. That's all I have time for.' 
 'Police have yet to comment on the triple murder investigation, but with shares in UK Remicon falling, CEO William Ashton will need to move quickly to reassure investors.' 
 Ah, Bruce, come in. 
 You wanted to see me. 
 That's right. 
 I was concerned about you, Bruce. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Yes, it is. Why wouldn't it be? 
 You tell me. 
 Well, sir, if I can be honest with you... 
 Please. 
 This business with Henry Williams... 
 I think that I'm being drawn into something that's way above my head, and I'm not sure I want to be part of it. 
 Well, I'd say it's a little late for that now. 
 You started this... 
 You came to us -- and we have shown our gratitude. 
 Three people are dead! 
 They were killed by Henry. 
 You know, it's a... sad story, but he's the victim in all this. 
 UK Remicon screwed with his head, and now they're paying the price. 
 You saw what happened in India. You saw it with your own eyes. 
 That was just the start. 
 Why would he go after the other volunteers? That makes no sense. 
 Well, he's a very disturbed young man. 
 I don't think sense has got anything to do with it. 
 You know, you're lucky he didn't come after you. 
 'He didn't do it.' 
 Henry Williams is confused, all right? 
 He's not well -- but I don't think he's got it in him to kill anyone. 
 Then who did? 
 I don't know. 
 Obviously I don't know that yet! 
 I thought you said you had a load of evidence. 
 Well, all the evidence points to Henry Williams. 
 Tell me. 
 OK. 
 There was a roll of adhesive tape in his room. 
 Well, well, well. 
 It matches the tape that we found on the roof that was used when Mark Henson was killed. 
 That's not conclusive. 
 No -- but that's not all. 
 We've got fibres from his clothes that place him at both crime scenes -- 
 Mark Henson AND Laura Jones. 
 And we found strands of Laura's hair on one of his jackets. 
 There was also bloodstains on his mother's car. 
 AB -- the same blood type as Steve Mullen. 
 And we know he drove up the M1 to Luton the day Mullen died. 
 Is that where he lived? 
 Yeah. 
 It might have been someone else in the car. 
 I wish it was. 
 We got a facial image from one of the cameras. 
 And he used his phone less than a mile away from the place where Mullen worked. 
 Anything else? 
 I already told you. 
 I saw him at the station when Laura was killed. 
 He was definitely there. 
 So he did it. 
 What? 
 Well, it's obvious. 
 I just said he didn't do it, what...? 
 But you just proved that he did. 
 How much evidence do you need? 
 The evidence could have been planted. 
 Who by? What planet are you on?! 
 The same planet that spiked your drink and almost has you under a truck. 
 This is big... and I'm going to prove it -- even if I have to do it on my own. 
 Go on, then, convince me. 
 OK. 
 First of all, someone turned off the cameras at the tube station at the exact same time Laura Jones was killed. 
 There were two women there. Contract workers. 
 Who were they? What were they doing? 
 And then there's the question of Henry Williams and the money he was being paid. 
 How does he afford all this stuff? 
 He's getting paid 20 grand a year. 
 Yeah, but why? 
 I mean, why are Greenfern still paying him? 
 Look, this has got something to do with what happened in India. 
 All the people that took part in that experiment are being killed, and Henry's getting the blame. 
 Is that what your bosses think? 
 No, of course not. They won't listen to me. 
 How about you? 
 I'm off the case. 
 Why? 
 We can't investigate David Leese while you're investigating Henry Williams. 
 So what are you doing? 
 I'm not doing anything. 
 Bruce Lockwood. 
 Who's he? 
 He was the one who led us to Henry Williams. 
 He was in India. We should talk to him. 
 You and me? 
 Why not? 
 Just take it seriously, OK? 
 So where did you get this van? 
 From a guy I live with. 
 He's a builder. 
 Yeah, I'd never have guessed. 
 What are you doing? 
 I need coffee. 
 Are you mad? We're an hour late! 
 What? I can't drive without coffee. 
 Wait! 
 We should have taken the train. 
 Bruce Lockwoood was in India -- and what's interesting is, he also works for a pharmaceutical company. 
 Ruhn Laboratories. 
 They're bastards. 
 What, you know them? 
 Yeah, I've read about them. 
 And? 
 They're an American pharmaceutical company, and they're bastards. 
 'Can't this thing go any faster?' 
 I'm touching the floor. 
 I'm THROUGH the floor. 
 This is rubbish. 
 Can you just relax, OK? 
 It will get us there. 
 Bruce... 
 I'm afraid we're going to be late. 
 Something's come up with the case. 
 'A couple of hours?' 
 You are so annoying. 
 Idiot. 
 OK, that's better. 
 Let's go. 
 Hurry up, we haven't got all day! 
 Alison, do you know where Stefan is? 
 Er, he didn't come in today. 
 He said he was going to Bristol with a friend. 
 OK. 
 So, tell me, why are we interested in Bruce Lockwood? 
 Look... 
 Why was he at Laura Jones's funeral? 
 He hasn't seen her in, what, like, six years? 
 And suddenly he turns up. 
 HE'S the one that led us to Henry Williams. 
 I don't know, but it almost feels... 
 Deliberate. 
 Exactly. 
 Thank you for looking in, William. 
 I saw you on the television. 
 Yes. Not my natural habitat. 
 Mm. 
 Did you know about Greenfern? 
 Is that why you asked me here? 
 I just wondered. 
 I only came to UK Remicon two years ago, Peter. 
 Greenfern had already been wound down. 
 What exactly happened in India? 
 I'm making it my business to find out. 
 You may be running out of time. 
 We're under attack. You do know that, don't you? 
 This has all been orchestrated. 
 Who would do that? 
 Anyone with an interest in a billion pounds' worth of business. 
 Ruhn Laboratories? 
 I wouldn't put it past them. When it comes to business, the Americans lead the world in ruthlessness. 
 Have you heard anything more from the SFO? 
 They seem to be retreating. 
 They've pulled out one of their teams. 
 Well, that's something. 
 If they went public right now, it could be the end of us. 
 We wouldn't want that. 
 Precisely. 
 How are we going to do this? 
 What do you mean? 
 I've never done an interrogation. 
 Um... 
 It's easy. All right? We'll just do good cop, bad cop. 
 But... 
 I'm not a cop. 
 Yeah, but he... 
 He doesn't need to know that. 
 Yeah. 
 OK. 
 I will be bad cop. 
 No! I'm the bad cop. 
 Why? 
 Because I've done lots of interviews. 
 And it was my idea. 
 Come on, Rash, this is going to be fun. 
 He's just through there. 
 Do you remember me? 
 Of course. 
 But I don't understand why you've come back. 
 I'll tell you why, Bruce. 
 Because you've been telling us a pack of lies. That's why. 
 I'm sorry. Who's he? 
 He's an investigator working with me. 
 I didn't lie to you. 
 You went to Laura's funeral, even though you haven't seen her in six years. 
 Why'd you do that? 
 Could you just, um... just wait a minute? 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 What? 
 I was going to ask him that. 
 Go on, then. 
 Why did you go? 
 I don't know. It was an impulse. 
 That's another lie! 
 You knew Laura for one week. 
 You don't see her in six years and now, suddenly, you're at her funeral. 
 That... doesn't make any sense. 
 Unless you had another agenda. 
 And then there was Henry Williams. 
 When did you see him? 
 I haven't seen him. 
 Really? 
 The sixth was a man called Henry Williams. 
 He's living in London. 
 Then how did you know he was living in London? 
 I-I don't know. Someone told me. 
 Who? 
 Well, I don't remember. One of the others. 
 He's lying. 
 You told us because you wanted us to know. 
 It was the same with David Leese. 
 It was run by a guy called David Leese. 
 He works for the NHS. 
 Have you met him? 
 No. 
 Do you know what he looks like? 
 No! 
 Then why'd you tell us his name? 
 Look, I don't know what you're talking about -- you asked me questions, I gave you answers. 
 He did that VERY well, didn't he? 
 I thought so. 
 Look, I don't have to tell you anything. 
 This has got nothing to do with me. 
 And now he's getting nervous. 
 Look, Bruce... 
 You, Mark Henson, Laura Jones, Steve Mullen and Henry Williams all took part in a drugs test and something went wrong. 
 Now three of those people are dead. 
 What do you think about that? 
 (You could be next.) 
 It's got nothing to do with me. 
 It's got everything to do with you. 
 You know the truth. 
 And, whoever you're protecting, they know that too. 
 I wouldn't go near any tube stations. 
 That's ridiculous. 
 I bet they already know you've talked to us today. 
 And the question is, are they going to trust you? 
 I wouldn't. 
 Well, um... here's my number if you want to talk. 
 Oh, but I'll give you some advice... 
 Don't leave it too late. 
 Heh. 
 That went well! 
 I thought I was supposed to be bad cop. 
 What? You were. 
 I thought you were good. 
 Yes. But I was supposed to be bad. 
 You were bad! 
 But you were bad cop too! 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Yeah, we got what we wanted! 
 He's scared. He'll come back to us. 
 Now... I want you to do the same thing to David Leese. 
 Why? 
 I helped you, you help me. 
 
 
 
 You were here before. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Where's your senior officer? 
 He sent me. 
 Why? 
 Further information has come to light, sir. 
 You told us that you'd never heard of Henry Williams, who's now the chief suspect in a murder enquiry. 
 Yet it turns out a company, Greenfern Consultancy Services, has been paying him nearly £2,000 a month. 
 You are the chief executive. 
 Who told you that? 
 It's possible he's being paid. But what I told you was true... 
 I never met him. 
 Can you tell me why he's being paid? 
 It wasn't my decision. 
 I imagine someone decided that we owed him a duty of care. 
 As a matter of fact, I'm quite surprised he was given anything at all... considering what happened. 
 And what did happen exactly? 
 He was part of a medical trial. 
 I told you the last time you were here. 
 But he lied on his application. 
 There was a whole cocktail of drugs in his blood. 
 As a result, he had a minor episode. 
 We cared for him, sent him home as soon as he was ready. 
 What was the name of the drug being tested? 
 Stenokoritin. It was an antidepressant. 
 OK, well, er, if you have any further thoughts, you know how to reach me. 
 Of course. 
 There is one other thing. 
 We've had a complaint from a secretarial assistant working in this building. 
 What sort of complaint? 
 I'm afraid to say, it's not very pleasant, sir. 
 It's of a sexual nature. 
 Who? 
 His name's Stefan Kowolski. 
 The complaint's against you. 
 What? That's... that's outrageous. That's ridiculous. 
 You deny that you touched him in an inappropriate way in this office? 
 Of course I deny it, I'm married! 
 And it's his word against mine. 
 Yes, sir. 
 But he may not be the only one. 
 He says that there are other employees who are also willing to make statements. 
 Who? 
 Well, we don't know yet. 
 But, um... we'll let you know. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 Did he buy it? 
 He almost had a heart attack. 
 That's great! 
 Yeah, if we scare him enough, he'll talk. 
 Yeah. 
 But who to? 
 This is your place, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Don't you like living here? 
 I do. 
 You don't sound too happy to be back. 
 You know what it's like, living with two women. 
 There are no women where I live. 
 I wish there were. 
 We could swap. 
 No, we couldn't. 
 Just a thought. 
 Sometimes I think it's time to move on. 
 If I could afford to move out, I'd go tomorrow. 
 OK, well, see ya. 
 You'll hear from Bruce -- he's worried. 
 I'll call if he does. 
 Rash? 
 We make a good team. 
 Missing you already! 
 It's Coleman. 
 We may have a problem. 
 Could you tell me who gave you the authority to go back and interview David Leese? 
 I didn't think I needed authority. 
 David Leese is the chief pharmacist of the London Health Trust and YOU are a TDC. 
 You need authority to sneeze! 
 What was the point, anyway? 
 We've already made an arrest. 
 Leese is not a suspect in this investigation. 
 A company he once ran has been paying Henry Williams nearly £2,000 a month! 
 Who told you that? 
 Remind me, Marcus. 
 Didn't I ask you to close down this operation? 
 He took a day off. 
 I didn't know what he was doing. 
 He's your responsibility. 
 Strolling around Ruhn Laboratories, pretending to be a police officer, for God's sake! 
 He didn't say he was a police officer, he said he was an investigator. 
 He's not even that. 
 Who's that from? 
 Their legal department, who do you think? 
 Threatening us with all sorts of unpleasantness. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Sorry's not good enough, actually. It really isn't. 
 We're up against corporations 50 times bigger than us. 
 More resources, more money, more time. 
 And then when we make mistakes, we have the press, the politicians, the AGO breathing down our backs. 
 And... we get sued. 
 Somebody has got to answer for this, Marcus. 
 David Leese has made a formal complaint. 
 So, as far as I'm concerned, that's it. 
 I've got enough on my plate without having to answer for you. You're out! 
 If I'm pissing people off, maybe it's because they're covering it up. 
 Covering up what? 
 I don't think Henry Williams killed anyone. 
 Tell him. 
 Henry Williams has confessed. 
 When? 
 What does it matter? We've got it all on tape. 
 Case closed. 
 You're not stupid but you've overreached yourself. So, get out. 
 Go on, clear your desk. Go. 
 I've spoken to Sergeant Short, he's expecting you. 
 Thank you for the opportunity. 
 Yeah, well, I'm sorry. 
 You brought this on yourself. 
 Are you sure about this, guv? 
 What? 
 He had his uses. 
 Yeah. 
 But he blew it, Derek. That's it. 
 'He's got to go.' 
 Stefan? 
 I'm sorry, I know you like him, but that's how it is. 
 But this proves he's getting somewhere. 
 Lose him. 
 Stefan? 
 I'm sorry, I need to have a word. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Well, that didn't last long. 
 Sarge... It's not what it looks like. 
 It doesn't look very good, if you want the honest truth. 
 I stumbled onto something. All right, it just happened. 
 You know, the chances of you getting another TDC posting after this are pretty slim. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 I'm sorry, Sayyad. 
 Better get to work. 
 You're not going to get me into trouble, are you? 
 Only be a few minutes. 
 Mrs Williams. 
 I wonder if we could have a word? 
 How is Henry? 
 They wouldn't let me see him today, I don't know. 
 They told me he confessed. 
 Yes, he did. 
 I don't understand, the last time you came here you weren't dressed like that. 
 He's... been promoted. 
 They asked him all these questions. 
 Half the time he doesn't know what's going on. 
 He just... told them what they wanted to hear. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's her fault, that girl he's been seeing. 
 Who's that? 
 On the computer. 
 She's my friend. She's real! 
 They're always talking to each other -- day and night. 
 The middle of the night, sometimes. 
 What? 
 You heard her? 
 So, she was real? 
 Course she was real! 
 She was the one leading him on! 
 I went to meet someone. Caroline. 
 But they won't listen to me, your lot. 
 They're just picking on Henry because of how he is. 
 I feel sorry for her. 
 And I think she was telling the truth. 
 Maybe that's it. 
 The girl on the computer. 
 What about her? 
 Maybe Henry was being used. 
 Who by? 
 They want us to know about India. 
 They want us to know what happened. 
 Yes? 
 This is Bruce Lockwood. 
 Er, yes? 
 I'd like to see you again. I'm coming down to London tonight. 
 OK. 
 I'm staying at the Lambton Hotel. Do you know where that is? 
 I'll find it. 
 Eight o'clock. 
 I'll see you there. 
 How are things? 
 Er... 
 I've been fired. 
 So have I. 
 I have to say, it's been a real experience meeting you. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 The same. 
 Look, I'm... 
 I'm glad you came, OK? 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Maybe we are a team. 
 Yeah. 
 I had nothing else to do. 
 Come on. 
 Mr Lockwood's expecting you, gentlemen. 
 Room 927. 
 Thank you. 
 Did they really fire you? 
 Yeah. It was David Leese. 
 He called my boss. 
 I said he'd talk. 
 Oh, it was a great idea, yeah. 
 I mean, he talked... to someone who took away my job. 
 I talked to you, and the same thing happened to me. 
 So, what will you do? 
 I don't know. 
 How about you? 
 Get the truth. 
 And get our jobs back. 
 Come on, Rash. 
 Thanks for coming. 
 This is a nice place. 
 All right for some. 
 Erm... What do you want? 
 I... I want to tell the truth. 
 Look, I never meant for any of this to happen. 
 I was just trying to... 
 I was thinking of my career. 
 But they've manipulated me and I don't know what -- - Does your, er, company pay for the, er, minibar? 
 Go ahead. 
 Look, I went to Laura's funeral because I was told to. 
 They said the police would be there and I was told to approach them. 
 Yeah, told -- who by? 
 Coleman Blake. 
 He's the UK vice president for Ruhn Laboratories. 
 He's the one behind all of this. 
 Ruhn Laboratories want us to know what happened in India. 
 Yeah. 
 Why? 
 Because they're using it to bring down the competition. 
 UK Remicon. 
 That's what this is all about! 
 What was the drug you tested in Mumbai? 
 You said it was an anti-depressant. 
 David Leese said it was something called Stenokoritin. 
 That's what UK Remicon said. 
 But they were crazy about security, it was just another smokescreen. 
 It was actually an anti-obesity drug. 
 It suppresses hunger by acting on the brain. 
 Lipocite! 
 It's one of the biggest sellers for UK Remicon. 
 It's worth millions. 
 So, what happened in India? 
 How did you find out? 
 There were six of us. 
 We were all given injections. 
 They said it would make us drowsy. 
 But I woke up just in time to see one of the volunteers leaving. 
 I don't know why, but it seemed to me that he was behaving strangely, so I decided to follow him. 
 Put it down! 
 There was mayhem after that. 
 I headed back to the ward, but on the way, I had an idea. 
 I wanted to know what it was that they'd injected into us. 
 So... I stole that. 
 I hung on to it and then, of course, I got a job at Ruhn Laboratories. 
 And, later on, you told your bosses. 
 And they've been using Henry. 
 They've been deliberately screwing with his mind and he gets the blame for the murders. 
 Lipocite gets withdrawn and they corner the market. 
 They'd kill three innocent people for that? 
 The NHS spends £1 billion a year on anti-obesity drugs. 
 Three people dead is... 
 Are you expecting anyone? 
 No. 
 Turn-down service. 
 Beds and towels? 
 Actually, this isn't a good moment, do you mind? 
 Not at all. We will come back. 
 Sorry to disturb you. 
 Like I was saying, how many people would you kill for a billion pounds a year? 
 Three people dead is nothing. 
 You're right. Ruhn has got a product similar to Lipocite. 
 It's cheaper and we've been trying to sell it to the NHS... 
 We've got to get out of here. 
 What? 
 Those two women. 
 They were downstairs. 
 And they were in the train station. 
 Go! 
 Go. Go, go... 
 GO! 
 Up or down? Up or down? 
 Down! 
 Up! 
 Right. 
 OK... 
 We... 
 Or... 
 No, no, no. No. 
 We don't need to do this. 
 No? If they come through that door? 
 They won't. 
 We've got nowhere to hide! 
 They killed Bruce. That's what they wanted. They don't need us. 
 The bomb was for all of us. 
 We've got no choice, we have to jump. 
 They won't come! 
 They might! 
 Oh... OK... 
 OK? 
 OK! 
 OK. 
 On three. 
 One... 
 Two... 
 Three! 
 OK... We... Did we really just do that? 
 Let's do it again! 
 You're not serious? 
 No. I'm not serious. 
 No, never again. None of this. 
 That's it. 
 Do you want chocolate? 
 Ohhh... 
 'In a statement that shocked the pharmaceutical industry,' the US Justice Department today announced that they have frozen the assets of major corporation, Ruhn Laboratories, pending a joint investigation with the British Police. 
 It was a frame-up. 
 They knew Henry was ill and they were manipulating him through his computer and mobile phone. 
 The woman he knew as Caroline got him to come to the station. 
 Because it's romantic, Henry. 
 Come down the escalator and meet me on the platform. 
 She also persuaded him to drive to Luton and stole the car while he was there and used it to kill Steve Mullen. 
 They planted the tape in his room and all the other evidence. 
 Well, well, well. 
 They wanted us to arrest him. 
 All right. All right. I get it. 
 I've never come across anything like it, but it seems you were right, Sayyad. 
 What about the American, Coleman Blake? 
 Bruce Lockwood implicated him before he died. 
 Yeah, well, we can't arrest him. Not yet. 
 But we're still gathering evidence on him and there's nowhere he can go. 
 We want him, the Americans want him. 
 He knows who was giving the orders for all this and he will talk. 
 William Ashton has resigned as CEO of UK Remicon. 
 And Lipocite has been withdrawn from the market. 
 What about David Leese? 
 He's been arrested for his part in the Greenfern cover-up. 
 'For concealing the results of the medical tests.' 
 'What about taking bribes?' 
 Leese was getting his commission from Greenfern Consultancy Services. 
 We've managed to track down payments. 
 We know we've got him squirming on the hook. 
 He's telling us everything we want to know. 
 Everything about UK Remicon's business practices. 
 Which is what we wanted in the first place. 
 Right. 
 I suppose you expect me to give you your job back? 
 Um... 
 Yeah. And I want a pay rise. 
 Don't push your luck. 
 You can have your job -- same pay, same conditions -- but may I remind you, this is a serious organisation, this is not The Man From UNCLE. 
 And... what about the two women? 
 Oh, the mysterious Caroline and her friend. 
 Well, we may never know. 
 I've spoken to Special Branch, Counterterrorism, Interpol. 
 The best guess is they've almost certainly already left the country. 
 Do you mind?! 
 Henry! 
 It's all over now. 
 I'll look after you. Don't worry. 
 It's all going to be all right. 
 Here you are. 
 So, how are you? 
 I'm good. 
 I got my job back. 
 Me too. 
 So why did you want to meet here? 
 Well, I just thought you might be interested. 
 What? 
 I'm looking at a flat. 
 What, to rent? 
 To buy. 
 Why would I be interested in that? 
 I can only afford half the mortgage. 
 It's been on the market a while. They've dropped the price. 
 It looks all right. 
 Yeah. 
 Two bedrooms. 
 Yeah. 
 All right, I'll take a look. 
 Why not? 
 Oi, your face jumping off the building. Scared! 
 What're you talking about? I wasn't scared. 
 I'd do it again right now. 
 Your face!
