 'Accident on a building site.' 
 It's The Scimitar. 
 A few days before he died, he went to see someone -- an antiques dealer. 
 'I think he sold something to Gulliver.' 
 Charles Matherson. 
 The minister? 
 He's corrupt and I want you to nail him. 
 We'll need to look into his private life. 
 I'll find a way in. 
 There can't be any question of a delay, Louis. 
 The order's already been confirmed. 
 Got to keep a clear head. 
 Why? 
 Cos I'm working. 
 You don't want to offend these guys. 
 All right. 
 No, no, no... Can't fall asleep. 
 Wait, you're making a mistake. 
 There are two of them. 
 What? 
 I can find it for you! 
 I can do that myself. 
 Jesus! 
 How did this happen? How COULD it happen? 
 It wasn't your fault. 
 I know it's not my fault. 
 It's your fault!

♪ It won't be long before I cave in and open up the door. ♪ 
 They're going to fire me. 
 They're going to throw me out. 
 I thought they already did throw you out. 
 Yeah... then they took me back. 
 And now they're going to throw you out again? 
 You do like to make things difficult for yourself. 
 It's not me. 
 It wasn't my fault. My DS hates me. 
 What about Stefan? Isn't he on your side? 
 Stephan's SFO. He's nothing to do with me. 
 He's your friend. 
 Please tell me you don't fancy him. 
 Why would you say that? 
 I don't know. He's an idiot. 
 We had a fight. 
 Men! 
 Just go back in there and tell them what happened. 
 I fell asleep? 
 No. 
 Narcolepsy? 
 Yeah, it's, erm... a neurological condition. 
 You know, in-in the brain. 
 Don't try and bullshit me, Sayyad. You fell asleep. 
 (Yes, guv.) 
 Tell me, Derek. 
 According to forensics, somebody tried Gulliver to a chair and then set him on fire. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Was there any sign of forced entry? 
 It didn't look like it. 
 Then he must have known them. He let them in. 
 At one o'clock in the morning? 
 All right, well, the cameras, I'm assuming they were still working?! 
 I don't know, guv. 
 Detective Superintendent Milton's on top of all that, but, as you can imagine, he's not been too cooperative. 
 DI Heywood, thank you so much for lending me your man. 
 Your man who buggered up this operation in the first place, put my DC out of action... then didn't notice when my target was being murdered! 
 All right, shall we take this into my office? 
 We found nothing that implicates Charles Matherson in anything illegal or even faintly suspicious. 
 No second properties, no company associations, nothing unusual in his bank... 
 There is just the question of his wife. 
 What about her? 
 Helen Matherson. Her father owns a quarry in Yorkshire. 
 We know that. 
 Well, the father is unwell. He has dementia. 
 Helen Matherson has taken full control of the business. 
 Well, that proves our point. 
 No, no, not necessarily. 
 It's not a crime for a minister's wife to run her own business. 
 Did you get anything from his computer? 
 Nothing that isn't already on public record. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Helen Matherson is selling ragstone to the Wesley Brothers for millions of pounds and her husband, Charles Matherson, just happened to green light their latest project? 
 Are they paying market prices or are they paying over the odds? 
 No, I checked the invoices. 
 There were four major sales over the last year, all at reasonable market rates. 
 You see? They're doing nothing wrong. 
 I'm sorry, I can see no reason to further authorise this investigation. 
 So we've been wasting our time? 
 No, Stefan, we've just been doing our job. 
 What on earth happened to your eye? 
 Pfft, nothing. I had an argument. Someone I know. He's an idiot. 
 What, you really think you can walk in here looking like that? 
 This has nothing to do with work. 
 Well, I'm happy to hear it. 
 I cannot have people working here looking as though they've been in a barroom brawl. You should never have come in. 
 I came in because I wanted to help. 
 You can help me by staying at home until you look presentable. 
 And may I remind you this is not fun? This is not a lark. 
 This is serious business. No, no, no, no. 
 Heh. Right. 
 Remind me again what we know about Gulliver. 
 Well, I've told you, he's a handler. 
 He's dealt in stolen objects, art, antiques. 
 He's very smart. Never did any time, but we think he's connected to any number of London gangs, including the one that's been making public sculptures. 
 If Gulliver's got a whole load of disreputable friends, surely any one of them could have been responsible? 
 Well, one thing's for certain -- we're not going to find much at his place. 
 It's pretty much burnt to the ground. 
 All right, well... let us take over from here. 
 And what am I meant to do in the meantime? 
 Well, didn't you get anything from the van? 
 No. We spoke to the owner of the company that rented it, a lowlife called Jerry Clarke, but he's not helping us at all. 
 Half his vehicles aren't even insured. 
 We should close the whole lot down. 
 Jerry Clarke? 
 I'm sorry? 
 Erm... Have you met him? 
 What does it matter to you? 
 Everything all right, John? 
 I don't know, JC. You were just leaving, weren't you? 
 Thickset, dark hair, clean-shaven? 
 I haven't met him. Spoke to him on the phone. 
 Well, I think I saw him. 
 When I was at Gulliver's place, he was talking to someone and he called him JC. 
 It could have been anyone. 
 But suppose whoever stole the sculptures didn't RENT the van... 
 .. suppose they owned it. 
 Police! Police! You're under arrest! 
 What's all this about? What do you think you're doing?! 
 Jerry Clarke? 
 Yeah. 
 Is this the man you saw? 
 Yeah. 
 You're under arrest. 
 Watch your head. 
 Guv! Through here! 
 Let me just check my diary. 
 Yeah, yeah, I think it'll be fine. 
 OK, I'll speak to you later. Bye. 
 Miss Andrews? 
 I'm a mate of Adam Jannsen. 
 He shared with you, is that right? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, he had something of mine. 
 A little gold dish, about this big. 
 Not valuable, just... sentimental. 
 But I want it back. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You find it, you return it to me. 
 How can I do that when I don't even know who you are? 
 Well, I'll come back here in a couple of days. 
 Make sure you've got it. 
 Or else. 
 Or else what? 
 Sir? Sir?! 
 Yeah, he's with us now. It's fine, thank you. 
 Can you explain this?! 
 It's fairly straightforward it's a viability appraisal. 
 And you're going to present it to the council. 
 We already have. 
 A 60% cut in affordable housing, no health centre, no local park, no transport improvements. 
 You have gone back on every single one of your Section 106 obligations! 
 Section 106 obligations are there to be renegotiated, everybody knows that. 
 You were always going to do this, right from the start. 
 You have taken advantage of the planning laws! 
 Which your government brought in, let's not forget that. 
 It's all about sustainable development. 
 It's about sustaining the community, not your profits! 
 I gave you the green light because I thought you were going to benefit a whole area of London. 
 Starting, of course, with you and Mrs Matherson. 
 You've benefited quite a bit yourselves, as I recall. 
 If you go ahead with these demands, you are going to make me a laughing stock. 
 Is that was this is all about? 
 Get real, Charles. We're on a knife-edge here. 
 We need to persuade the investors to hang in with us and, if they pull out, we're all screwed and I don't just mean Elly and me. 
 We're all in this together. 
 I've done nothing illegal. Nobody's going to come after me. 
 But if you try and wriggle out of your commitments, I swear I will make you pay! 
 You already have. 
 I've been going through these invoices and there is something that's been bugging me. 
 This came off the memory stick from the Mathersons. 
 White Dragon Shipping. 
 What about it? 
 Helen Matherson has paid White Dragon Shipping on four separate occasions. They're listed here. 
 Paid them? What for? 
 Presumably for exporting ragstone. These are huge containers. 
 That must be the samples I saw. 
 There was a whole box of them labelled in Mandarin. 
 Look at the dates. 
 Now, compare them to these. 
 These are the four sales I mentioned before, each between £1m and £2m. 
 They're all about a month later. 
 So Helen Matherson is selling to the Chinese and then she sells to the Wesleys. 
 Is it a coincidence? How does it make sense? 
 They've just negotiated a new sale, this time it's The Scimitar. 
 According to your logic, the Mathersons are making another deal with White Dragon. 
 I hope it helps. 
 We need to find out if there's another ship coming in. 
 It might be here already. 
 Marcus, Eleanor closed down the investigation. 
 She sent me home. 
 Then she won't know what you're up to. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Yes, Alison, come in. 
 Sit down. 
 That was good work this morning, Helen Matherson running her father's quarry, that makes a big difference. 
 Thank you, Eleanor. 
 What I'm interested in is how you came about that information. 
 Peter Mayhew gave it to me. 
 He's your uncle, isn't he? 
 You knew. 
 Well, I make it my business to know as much as I can about the people I employ. 
 What have you told him about us? 
 I try to tell him as little as I can. 
 I'm sorry, Eleanor. 
 No, don't be. 
 I dropped the investigation because I don't want Peter Mayhew manipulating us like he's been manipulating you. 
 But that said... it might be useful to keep his connection. 
 If we continue this investigation, it'll be on our terms, not Mayhew's, but it's fine if he knows that we're not pursuing Charles Matherson. 
 And, of course, I'd prefer it if you didn't mention to him that I knew. 
 I won't say anything. 
 Thank you. 
 I knew I could rely on you, Alison. 
 You realise I should get rid of you, don't you? 
 There's no reason why you should stay one minute longer as a TDC in my office. 
 I made a mistake and it won't happen again. 
 It certainly won't happen again if you're out, will it? 
 Guv, I... 
 Shut up! 
 Let me see if I can talk myself out of firing you. 
 Now, firstly, and this is not... entirely relevant... 
 .. nobody is going to mourn the loss of John Gulliver. 
 Secondly, Detective Superintendent Milton's got his precious statues back, largely thanks to you. 
 And I think you may have been right about Adam Jannsen and I think that just about... 
 .. gets you off the hook. 
 Thank you. 
 It doesn't mean I want to see you around here. 
 Blackstone's Handbook For Policing Students. 
 Evidence and Procedure. 
 Investigator's Manual and Workbook. 
 I've read that one. 
 Read it again! 
 Well? 
 Eleanor's dropped the investigation. 
 That's a great pity. 
 She doesn't think there's enough evidence against Charles Matherson or his wife. 
 Then she can't have looked very far. 
 I hate doing this, I hate being disloyal. 
 Family loyalty comes first, Alison, you know that. 
 Anyway, I was helping you, I was helping the SFO, or trying to. 
 You never told me that you knew Eleanor. 
 Hmm? Oh, yes, I knew her husband. 
 I didn't know she was married. 
 He died. 
 It's a great shame. 
 What? 
 Matherson. 
 Never mind. 
 We'll find another way. 
 That truck has to go down! You've got to do this! 
 They're all crooks, yeah? 
 I saw you arguing. 
 They're not even paying me the living wage. 
 How do they get away with it? 
 If I complain, they'll throw me out. 
 They're bastards. 
 Yeah! 
 You couldn't do me a favour? 
 Miss Chen? 
 Yes? 
 I'm from ELT. 
 We're your IT support service. We've had a call out about this computer. 
 There's nothing wrong with my computer. 
 There is a fault with the dial-up connection -- the PPP -- the point-to-point negotiation point. 
 It'll only take a couple of minutes. 
 OK. 
 You... you couldn't get me a cup of coffee? 
 Come on. 
 Come on, come on! 
 Come on, come on... 
 Have a drink on me. 
 Thanks. 
 Charles, something rather strange has just happened. 
 I've just had a call from Mr Tang. 
 Who? 
 White Dragon Shipping. 
 Is there a problem? 
 There may be. 
 Someone broke into their office this afternoon, he said he was from a software company, and he accessed our account. 
 What? 
 He did a search, first on your name and then on mine. 
 Who was it? 
 They have no idea. 
 They got a picture of him as he was leaving on CCTV. 
 That isn't a software engineer. 
 This is the driver! 
 All right, Charles. Thank you. 
 You know, you really have made a spectacular mess of all of this. 
 Did what you said. 
 You could have killed Adam Jannsen at home. 
 You could have killed him on his way to work. 
 Tried. 
 Got close. 
 Hello, man. 
 Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry. 
 There was someone with him... and you said it had to be done quickly. 
 But not on the construction site. 
 You never said that. 
 You might have worked out the consequences! 
 Or don't you know anything? 
 I know things you don't, Louis. 
 I do things you won't. 
 Maybe you should get your hands dirty sometime before you lay into me. And while we're on that subject, you still owe me ten grand for Gulliver. 
 You'll have it. But first of all, we need to close everything down. 
 Do you understand me? 
 No, I don't. What do you mean, exactly? 
 I mean anything that leads anyone to me. 
 This has gone on long enough. Close it down. 
 All right. Who do you want me to deal with first? 
 So you've still got your job, then? 
 Yeah, just about. 
 Do you want anything? 
 No, I'm OK. 
 Oh, might have found a room in a house. 
 That's great. 
 It's in Dalston. 
 There's a girl I met, but it's complicated. 
 She's part of an investigation. 
 What's she done? 
 SHE hasn't done anything. 
 I'll get it. 
 Leila? 
 Leila! 
 You! 
 Look, I've come to say sorry... about last night. 
 Brought you some... wine. 
 You brought me a bottle of wine to apologise for getting me pissed? 
 It was either that or flowers. 
 Do you want a beer? 
 He's not staying! 
 That'd be great, thanks. 
 Cheers. 
 How'd it go? With Heywood? 
 Oh, yeah. No, he was fine about it. 
 Didn't mind at all. 
 Really? 
 No! 
 Of course not. What do you think? He sent me home. 
 Me, too. 
 What happened? 
 He... hit me. 
 It wasn't like that. 
 It's a long story. 
 Our boss threw me out. 
 She said I couldn't come to work looking like this. 
 Well, she has a point. 
 Want me to look at that? 
 No! He's all right. 
 Doesn't need any medical attention. 
 I might. 
 So what are you doing here, anyway? 
 What do you want? 
 The people you met at the Golabki Club. 
 Yeah? 
 They were lying to you. 
 Well, he didn't know Adam. They just worked together. 
 Roman Nowak? 
 Yeah, and his girlfriend. 
 How do you know? 
 Stefan. 
 Just stay there. 
 I'll be right round. 
 That was Karen. 
 Been with the police all day. 
 They made me wait for hours. 
 I had to fill in forms, but they're not going to do anything. 
 Poor Sebastian. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Are you OK? 
 I just hate the idea of someone being here and going through my things. This is about Adam, isn't it? 
 Er... I think so, yeah. 
 A man came up to me outside the restaurant this morning. 
 He said he was looking for something -- a dish. 
 A satellite dish? 
 No. 
 A little gold dish. 
 He said he was going to come back. 
 Did you tell the police this? 
 Of course I did. 
 I gave them his description, but I'm not sure they're interested. 
 It's not as if he hurt me. 
 Dish? 
 I just wish I'd never got involved. 
 I don't feel comfortable any more and I hate being here alone. 
 I'll be glad when you move in. 
 What?! 
 Stefan's taking the spare room. 
 When did you do that? 
 What? 
 The room? When did you even ask her? 
 When I met her at the Golabki Club. 
 She said she had a room going free. 
 Yes, but only because her flatmate had been murdered. 
 I mean, I wonder why she rang you and not me. 
 Anyway, how could you do that? You know, what was...? 
 What was all that stuff about us finding somewhere together? 
 
 
 
 OK. 
 Maybe I was out of line. 
 What am I meant to do? 
 I need somewhere to live. 
 Yes, so do I! 
 So, why didn't you ask her? 
 I'm... 
 I was going to. It just didn't feel appropriate. 
 Why not? 
 Why not? Um... I don't know. Maybe cos I'm a police officer investigating the death of the guy who used to live there(!) 
 That's why you're pissed off? 
 Because I got there first? 
 No! 
 Then what's the problem? 
 Look, I don't even want to talk about it. 
 All right? Now just get lost. Forget we ever met. 
 What about Roman and Eva? Don't you want to know? 
 What? 
 They were lying to you. 
 Yeah. How do you know? 
 Why are you pretending you don't speak English? 
 Your Polish is obviously perfect... but I can hear an English accent, too. 
 You've been here a long time. 
 Look, we just want to know who killed Adam. 
 We want to know what it was that he found. 
 The gold dish? 
 Small? 
 Yes. 
 Where? 
 On The Scimitar building site. 
 That's all we know. 
 We don't know anything else. 
 What did he do with it? 
 He said he'd sell it to someone called... John Gulliver. 
 Gulliver. 
 We know him. 
 He's dead. 
 We KNEW him. 
 How did he know Gulliver? 
 One of the guys told me about him. 
 He'd buy stuff and he wouldn't ask questions. 
 Did you meet him? 
 No. 
 He thought it might be worth something. That's all. 
 Maybe £50. 
 Why did you deny it? 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 We sent him to Gulliver. 
 Adam gets killed and then we see this. 
 We were scared. We didn't want to be involved. 
 This is Gulliver? 
 Let her go. 
 Get back in your car. Mind your own business. 
 I know him. 
 Are you sure you don't want a drink? 
 No, I don't want a drink, Raymond, I just want the truth. 
 What do you mean? I told you everything I know. 
 No, you didn't. 
 How long did you work for me? Five years? 
 You think I couldn't tell when you were lying? 
 I can't. 
 Are you scared? 
 You don't know these people. 
 Tell me. 
 There's a man called Craig. 
 Craig? 
 That's what he said. 
 Ex-Army. Nasty piece of work. I'd never seen him before but he knew all about me. 
 That you'd been in prison. 
 I'd have lost my job. 
 I'd have lost everything if I didn't do what he said. 
 But I swear to you, Derek, I didn't know anyone would get hurt. 
 For Christ sake, Raymond, what did you do? 
 I need a piss. 
 You're not going to run out on me? 
 Why would I do that, eh? 
 Just give me a minute, eh? 
 I'll have a large Scotch. Stick it on his tab. 
 Ta. 
 Derek! 
 Derek... 
 Raymond... 
 Hey! 
 sh1t. 
 Stay still, you stupid b*st*rd. 
 I'll get you an ambulance. 
 They're still lying. 
 Who? 
 Roman and Eva. 
 Look, they said the dish that Adam found was only worth 50 quid. But we know he got paid 800. 
 And he got a new phone. 
 Right, and they're lying because... 
 There were two of them. 
 Two dishes. They've got the other one. 
 That's the only way it makes sense. 
 Adam sells his and gets killed. Roman has to keep quiet. 
 And that's why Karen's place got ransacked. 
 Someone's still looking for it. 
 What are we doing here? 
 'It's simple. 
 'Adam finds a dish and sells it to Gulliver. 
 'Adam's blown up. 
 'Gulliver threatens the Wesleys. 
 'He burns to death.' 
 'The Wesleys are connected to Matherson.' 
 And...? 
 I want Matherson. 
 So I need to check the manifest to find out exactly what's on that boat. 
 How are you going to do that? 
 This is crazy. 
 What? 
 We're trespassing. 
 We're breaking the law. 
 You shouldn't have come. 
 You didn't give me any choice. 
 Come on! 
 Look, this has got nothing to do with me. 
 OK... 
 Rash? 
 Rash? 
 Rash! 
 I don't believe this. 
 This is not happening. 
 Are you OK? 
 No, I'm not OK! 
 My head really hurts. 
 Mine too. 
 I don't even know why I'm here. This has got nothing to do with me. 
 I know. You said. 
 You know, ever since I met you, my life has taken a serious turn downhill. 
 Hi. 
 Who are you? 
 I was about to ask you the same thing. 
 I'm a police officer. And I warn you, you're guilty of false imprisonment by detaining us here and probably kidnapping. 
 Which carries a sentence of life imprisonment. 
 Right. 
 Added to which, you're assaulting me as a police officer. 
 And are you going to tell me you're police as well? 
 Yeah. I'm with the Serious Fraud Office. 
 We know who you are. 
 We know everything about you. 
 You don't know my name. 
 Yeah, OK. But we now you were involved in the death of Adam Jannsen. 
 Yeah, and James Gulliver. 
 John Gulliver! 
 And the Wesleys are involved. 
 The Scimitar. 
 All right. You know something. 
 So, you've got to let us go. 
 I don't agree. 
 What are you going to do? 
 I've got nothing against you personally, but this is my job. 
 I've got to find out what you know. Who you're working for. 
 Then I've got to get rid of you. 
 What, are you going to kill us? 
 In cold blood? 
 Yeah, it's what I get paid to do. 10 grand a time. 
 It gets to be a bit of a habit, after a while. 
 Wait! 
 What now? 
 I'm a Catholic. 
 So what? 
 I want to pray. 
 Are you serious? 
 Yeah. It matters to me. 
 All right. Get on with it. I'll give you a minute. 
 And while you're doing that, I'll kill your friend. 
 What! 
 The trouble is, I can't do it standing up. 
 OK. You want me to untie you? Just get on with it, all right? 
 If you kill us, you'll never get what you want. 
 Now, what's that? 
 What you're looking for. It's why you killed Adam Jannsen. 
 He found it on a building site. 
 It's small, it's round, it's gold, shaped like a dish. 
 He sold it to John Gulliver. 
 And Gulliver used it to threaten the Wesleys. 
 And you got it back when you killed Gulliver. 
 But there were two of them, weren't there? 
 That's why you broke into Karen's place? 
 But it wasn't there. 
 It was too late. She'd already given it to us. 
 So, where is it now? 
 Obviously we're not going to tell you. 
 Whoa! 
 If you let us go, we'll take you to it. 
 We'll take you to it and we'll give you two hours to make your getaway. 
 And that's it. That's the deal. 
 So, you've got it? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, that changes things. 
 Thought it might. 
 I can't kill you after all. 
 Not if you ever want to see it again. 
 I'm going to have to talk to you first. Make you tell me where it is. 
 And then I'm going to kill you. 
 Do what you want. 
 We're not going to tell you anything. 
 Really? Oh, OK. 
 I think this might change your mind. 
 You have no idea what I can and can't do... 
 Both knees... elbows. 
 Listen, I want to know what you know. 
 So, which one of you is going to be first? 
 Start with him. 
 What? 
 He's got it! 
 No, I haven't! 
 It's in his van. 
 Where? 
 It's parked outside on the quay. 
 It's a white builder's van. It's in the back. 
 Parked where? 
 A five-minute walk away. 
 Over by the gate. 
 Where's the keys? 
 It's open. It's open. 
 And it's definitely there? Cos, you two, you aren't going anywhere. 
 When I come back, if I find out you're lying to me, really, I am, I'm going to do things to you that you wouldn't want to imagine. 
 It's there. 
 All right. 
 You're on your own down here. No-one can hear you. 
 And there's no way out. 
 Oh... 
 One second. 
 No way you can reach them, but, you know, best to be sure. 
 That's my new phone! 
 Why did you do that? 
 Back soon. 
 Help! Someone! 
 Hey! 
 All right! They can't hear you. 
 You could be a bit more positive. 
 This was his? 
 I've got another phone in my jacket. 
 What, you've got two phones? 
 Well, not normally. I've still got Adam's phone. 
 Karen gave it to me. 
 You can't reach it. 
 No. 
 But you can. 
 Oh! 
 My ribs! 
 Oh, all right, just find the phone! 
 Yeah, I can feel it. 
 It's right in front of your foot. 
 It's coming, it's coming. 
 OK. 
 Just don't let it drop. 
 I'm not going to let it drop. 
 Why did you have to drop it? 
 I didn't drop it on purpose! 
 He's coming back! 
 I know he's coming back, but I can't reach it. 
 Wait a minute. 
 I'll use my shoe. 
 That's good. 
 I've got it! 
 Is it on? 
 Yep. 
 We can call the police. 
 That's right. 
 How are you going to dial? 
 With my toes. 
 Oh, good work, mate. 
 Have you done it? 
 I'm doing it now. It's not easy. 
 Well, it's 999. 
 Well, I know the number. Yeah? I'm doing it with my toes. 
 'Emergency, which service?' 
 You've done it! 
 I did it! 
 We need the police! We're on a ship. 
 I'm DC Sayyad, I'm being held against my will. 
 He's coming for us. He's got a gun. We've been kidnapped. 
 Will you shut up. I'm telling them! 
 I'm telling them! 
 They can't hear us if we both shout at the same time. 
 All right. 
 Right. 
 Suspect... 
 We need the police! 
 You lied to me. 
 Look, it's there. 
 No, it's not. 
 OK! It's not in the van, but we know who's got it. 
 But we can't tell you. 
 Why not? 
 Because if we tell you, you'll go and kill them. 
 That's very noble of you, but I'm getting fed up with this, so I'm going to kill you instead. 
 Wait a minute! Are you going to kill us on the Dragon Star? 
 In the Tilbury Docks? 
 In the hold? 
 Where we're tied up? 
 What are you two doing? 
 And why have you taken your shoes off? 
 Armed police! 
 Are you all right? 
 It worked. 
 I can't believe it worked. 
 What worked? 
 We got the phone out, we managed to call you. 
 No, you didn't call us. 
 He did. 
 'Hello? Help is on its way. Help is on its way.' 
 So, it turns out that you were right. 
 I usually am. 
 The Wesley brothers were buying high-quality ragstone from the Mathersons and paying a premium price for it. 
 Yes. 
 Only it wasn't their product. 
 We checked -- the family quarry is almost empty. 
 There's nothing left. 
 So, where were they getting it from? 
 Well, they were buying it cheap from China, importing it through a shipping company called White Dragon. 
 When they sold it to the Wesleys, they were making a 500% profit. 
 Did the Wesley know they were being ripped off? 
 Of course they knew. 
 So the bribe money was being paid. 
 The Wesleys pay through the nose for an inferior product and Matherson... and his wife pocket the difference. 
 Paying over the odds for a cheap product demonstrates nothing more than bad business sense. 
 Exactly. 
 So Matherson is in the clear. 
 I understand that this new building has already been given the nom de plume of The Pyramid. 
 Two years from now, it will rise above this city, breathing new life to this area, confirming, once again, that when it comes to dynamism and growth, London really does lead the world. 
 This is your last chance. 
 You give it to us now or we go to the police. 
 I am the police. 
 Yeah, the proper police. 
 Look, you can't keep it, you can't sell it. 
 You've got no choice. 
 Why should we? 
 It's ours. 
 Heather. 
 It's what you dream of when you're a child. 
 A buried treasure. 
 Do you know how hard we work... 
 Roman and I? 
 And do you know how much we earn? 
 This city never gives you any chances. 
 And then this comes along. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's called an intaglio. 
 Probably 1st century AD. 
 These things always come in pairs. You see? Cautes and Cautopates. 
 Day and night. You can't have one without the other. 
 You say it was found on a building site? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, there's almost certainly something very exciting underneath. 
 A Mithraic temple. Perhaps an entire complex. 
 I just hope they have insurance. 
 Unexpected archaeological discovery insurance. 
 You don't have it. 
 Of course we do. We'd be mad not to. 
 No, we checked. 
 You didn't bother. 
 No. Louis would have told me. 
 I think there are a lot of things Louis didn't tell you. 
 You're right. 
 We didn't. 
 Why? 
 To save the money. 
 And that's why Adam Jannsen had to die. 
 He found an antique -- a golden medallion. 
 He showed it to John Gulliver and Gulliver guessed what it would be worth to you. 
 A find like that could shut you down for years. 
 Without insurance, you'd be dead ducks. 
 He tried to blackmail you so you had him killed... by the same person who killed Adam Jannsen. 
 You also planned the murder of Raymond Keane. 
 He's not dead. And he'll talk. 
 And finally, you were responsible for the kidnap and attempted murder of one of my detectives. 
 I understand that the person who actually committed these crimes is dead. 
 That's right. 
 Then, forgive me, Detective, but I would say that you have nothing that connects me to any of this. 
 That's not true. 
 DNA from the chewing gum found at the building site gives us Craig. 
 Craig leads us to you. 
 You met in the Territorial Army. 
 You were both in the 47th London Infantry Division. 
 We have large payments recovered from his house. 
 Your fingerprints are all over them. 
 Can I talk to Ellie? 
 Would that be possible, do you think? 
 I just want to explain. 
 And the Scimitar? 
 The site has already been designated an area of archaeological interest. 
 All work has been suspended for the next 15 weeks for rescue excavation. 
 The whole project has collapsed. It's never going to be built. 
 What a great shame. 
 Which brings us back to the question of high-rises in London. 
 You know, Marcus, my head of investigation, he hates them. 
 He thinks they're destroying the city. 
 Oh, I don't agree. 
 I think they're revitalising London. 
 They're the future. 
 Hmm. I've heard you say that many times... on record. 
 The Scimitar. 
 Yep. 
 You can actually see the site where it was going to be built from here. 
 Yeah, I believe so. 
 Yes, if it had gone up, it would have gone up right there. 
 Right in front of you. 
 Spoiling your view. 
 Wouldn't have been great for the value of your flat. 
 I hope you're not suggesting... 
 I'm not suggesting anything, Peter. 
 Goodbye. 
 So...? 
 You told her then? 
 What? 
 Karen. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I didn't want the room anyway. 
 Would've been a bit creepy... knowing the guy who died. 
 So it's free? 
 Yeah. 
 Did you take it? 
 Well, we got on really well. 
 It's a nice house. 
 You lied to me! 
 Oh, forget it. I didn't want it. 
 Too small. 
 And all those teddy bears. 
 Yeah. Sebastien. 
 Fergie. 
 Bruno. 
 Eddie. 
 Eddie? 
 Eddie the Teddy. 
 We'll find somewhere. 
 There's got to be somewhere. 
 Somewhere. 
 Yeah. 
 Right, come on.
