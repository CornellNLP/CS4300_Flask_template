 I was not a murderer, Sarah! 
 No! 
 Not until you made me one! 
 Announcer : Previously on "Slasher". 
 Vaughn : Help me! 
 (SOBBING) 
 I love you. 
 I'd like a memento. 
 What kind of memento? 
 He said he'd do it. For a lock of my hair. 
 That's creepy. 
 Can I ask you why you want that? 
 How much does Sarah know? 
 Dylan. 
 Those texts were personal, not news. 
 Sarah, I... 
 Did you think about Cam? 
 Did you think about what it'll be like for him when the whole town reads this crap? 
 Listen, I report the news, good or bad. You know that. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Is... Is that Tom? 
 You're not my father. 
 Sarah, it's not a matter of thinking anything. 
 Reading, huh? 
 (GROANING) 
 (YELLING) 
 Tom : Sarah. 
 Hey. 
 (GROANS) 
 Take it easy. Take it easy! 
 Did they call you? 
 Sarah : No. 
 I came myself. 
 (TOM SIGHS) 
 Sarah : How you feeling? 
 (SNICKERS) 
 How am I feeling? 
 (INHALES DEEPLY) 
 You came to see me. 
 Yeah. 
 Had a lot of time to think. 
 Put things into perspective and... 
 What? 
 I don't have enough family left to pick and choose. So... 
 Sarah : If we're gonna do this... there's gonna be some ground rules. 
 Anything. 
 No more lies. 
 No more lies. 
 I promise. 
 What do you want to know? 
 I wanna know why you killed my... my mother and her husband. 
 I want you to tell me the truth. 
 I want you to tell me... everything. 
 Every detail. 
 From the beginning. 
 Children : Trick or treat! 
 Woman : Stop running! 
 Children : Trick or treat! 
 (KIDS SCREAMING) 
 (SCREAMING CONTINUES) 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 (HEAVY BREATHING CONTINUES) 
 (KIDS SCREAMING) 
 Lose the scarf. You look like Liberace. 
 No, I don't. I look cool. 
 (WOMAN LAUGHS) 
 (DOORBELL RINGS) 
 Hey, hon. I think that's Alan. 
 We'll have a beer here first, and then we'll go, okay? 
 Woman : Sounds good. 
 Thought you guys were going trick-or-treating as, uh... 
 King Arthur and his band of Merry Men. 
 Wait, that's Robin Hood, right? 
 Anyway, man, Rachel's bailing. 
 Yeah, this last trimester is killing her. 
 Man : I can't remember, was the last trimester like that for Suzy? 
 Tired all the time. Not sleepin'. 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 Hey, Al, you want to take that stupid mask off now? 
 (HEAVY BREATHING CONTINUES) 
 Have a seat, man. 
 I'll get us a beer or something, okay? 
 (DOORBELL RINGS) 
 Here. 
 Hand these out for me? 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 No? 
 (SNICKERS) 
 Thanks for your help. 
 (DOOR OPENING) 
 Man : Happy Halloween! Man : So... What do you think? Pretty good, huh? Oh, and you should see Suzie's "Guinevere". I fell in love with her all over again. Hey, check it out. How cute is that? Does Cam look like a tiny little Merlin or what? (LAUGHS) Alan, what the hell's going on here? Who's that? I... I thought that was you. (GASPS) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (SCREAMING) (WHIMPERING) Please. Please. (GROANING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (SOBBING) (SCREAMING) Help! Help! Please! (SOBBING CONTINUES) No! Please! No! Tom! No, don't! Don't! Don't kill our baby! Please! Please. (CRYING) It's yours! She is. I wanted to tell you... but Bryan said he would kill me if I ever left him. Kill me and the baby. Please! I love you. (CRYING) I love you. I didn't mean to fall in love with you. But I did. I swear! I love you. (GASPING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) It was the only way I could save you from the two of them. No. Why didn't you just call Children's Aid or sued for custody or...? I mean... Hell, you could have even kidnapped me. Sarah. Tell me the truth. Why did you kill them? (SCOFFS) Take care of yourself, Tom. (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (WIND RUSTLING) Am I dumb? What? Am I dumb? I was beginning to think that moving back to Waterbury was the stupidest idea ever. Uh... Ariel Peterson is alive because of you. That's not dumb. That's... amazing. Honey. Tom is your father in DNA only. Okay? Hmm. Now... Eating for one is one of the loneliest ways to eat. So... How 'bout we harden our arteries? My treat. Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to, but... Dylan and I are having a talk. Uh-oh. More trouble in paradise? No paradise, just trouble. (TRAIN HORN) Sarah : Dylan? Dylan : In here. Dylan. What's all this? Well, this is a, uh, fiddlehead salad with a little... pickled red onion and toasted pecans, followed by a pan-seared lamb chop, pomegranate relish, and potato gratin on the side. And to wrap it all up, we have roasted pear with mascarpone espresso cream. Took the day off. Well, almost, kinda. I'm live with Lisa-Ann later on, but that was scheduled way before. Please, don't be upset. Upset? I mean, why would I be upset? This is... I can't believe you did all this. I've been a bad husband. No. No, I have. And, uh.... This is my way of... Of trying to... get things back on track. Thank you. To a new start. To fresh starts. Dylan : And moving here, and this huge change in our lives... And the killings. All this attention was thrown my way, and, uh... I wasn't ready for it. And I let it go straight to my head. And it took, um... (SNIFFS) It took almost losing you to... to realize what it was actually doing to me. Dylan : No, no, not to me. That's wrong. 'Cause I did this, and... 'Cause I did it. I made bad choices. (SIGHS) And I'm embarrassed, Sarah. (SIGHS) And I'm ashamed. Dylan, how...? (SIGHS) Neither of us could have imagined, when we moved here, that this would happen. You know? We weren't prepared. How... How could we have been? You know? Now, we... we have to face reality. And the reality is we can't stay here. And you can't keep covering the story. It'll destroy us. The truth is it's... either your career or our marriage. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose you either. Dispatch : All units, we have a report of a possible trespass at 35 McCall Street. The premises at that location is abandoned. Over. (GASPS) Dispatch! 3-2-0-5 on the scene at 35 McCall. I'm out of the car, checking out the premises. Over. Dispatch : Copy that. (FLOOR CREAKING) What the hell? (FLOOR CREAKING) Police! Come out! (PANTING) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, Sharma! Sharma : Holy sh1t, Cam. Check it out. Jesus. Sharma : Wraith, gluttony, envy, lust, greed, sloth? Aren't there seven deadly sins? I'm only counting six. Yeah. Pride. Hadn't been put up yet. Sharma : This is where the Vickers family died... that winter a couple of years ago. Suffocated. Cam : Yeah. Youngest kid was only 8-years-old. (SIGHS) Cam : You go through any of this? No. Cam : Verna McBride. Justin Faysal. Brenda Merritt. Envy. Trent McBride, June Henry. Iain Vaughn. Oh, Jesus. Sarah. Dispatch. Dispatch : Go ahead. I need forensics at 35 McCall Street. Dispatch : Copy. I want you to oversee the transfer of Tom Winston back to Franklin Penitentiary. You hear me? Right. I'm going to get Sarah. (SOFTLY) Come back. (SCRUBBING DISHES) Oh. Oh, oh... Let me get that. Let me get that. You can help. No, you can go and rest... your leg, is what you can do. You know, that's the best meal I've had in a long, long time? Yeah? I'll join you when I'm done in here. Mmm. Sounds good. (SCRUBBING DISHES) (SIGHS) Dylan? Dylan : Hmm? Dylan, I know you've been focusing on the present-day killings, but... you haven't come across anything new about my parents, have you? Sarah : Dylan? Yeah, sorry, I was just putting something away. Umm... Anything new, like what? I don't know, actu... I just get the feeling that Tom isn't telling me everything. Yeah? You think he, uh... he's holding something back? Maybe. Dylan : Well, you know, um, nothing comes to mind, but... you know, I haven't really been looking. Well, okay. No problem. Okay. (FAUCET RUNNING) (DISHES CLINKING) (PHONE VIBRATING) (PHONE VIBRATING) (PHONE VIBRATING) Dylan, what's your password? 7438. Why? Wi-Fi's spotty, and I want to Google something. Hey. So I was thinking. Tom Winston... has a huge ego, right? If he's hiding something, if he's holding something back, maybe... you should play him. Make him think that it was his idea to come out and give the whole story. You know what I mean? That might work. Give it a shot, at least. Sarah : I don't know. Why don't we ask you? You're the expert. I found your website. Okay, Sarah, listen. Um... What? What are you gonna say? Okay, look... I've... I've... I've been following the Executioner's story for a while. You certainly did. But when I fell in love with you, it was not because of the story. I swear to God. I fell in love with you because I fell... in love... with you. Sarah. When we met? You were looking for me. You were looking for a lead! That all went away, once I got to know you. You have to understand that. Sarah : No. No. Oh, my God. Everything you said. Everything you said was a lie! (BANGING ON DOOR) Leave us alone, okay? Don't touch me! Talk to me. Goddamnit! No! Leave! Cam. Dylan : Hey, man. Cam, what are you doing? It's The Executioner. He's coming for you. Cam : We still haven't ruled Dylan out as a suspect, Sarah. He's gonna have to stay somewhere else tonight. Yeah, that's fine. I don't want him here. Uh, Cam, I am such an idiot. How are you supposed to know, Sarah? You had your doubts. Why couldn't I see what you could? Oh, come on. Don't beat yourself up about it. Dylan's actions were his and his alone. Did you ever find it in your heart to forgive June? (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Sarah : Sorry. I'm sorry. None of my business. No, no, no. Um... (SIGHS) June hurt me. Badly. Yeah, I tried to forgive her, but... (SIGHS) I think if I'm being completely honest with myself... No. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (CAM CLEARS THROAT) Cam : Hey. Why don't you head upstairs and get yourself some sleep? Yeah? Yeah, I'll try. Seven sins, six killings. Only one victim remains. Who is that unlucky soul? And will the police find him or her before The Executioner does? Lisa-Ann : It's a race against time here in Waterbury. A town on edge and waiting for the killer to strike again. Lisa-Ann : I'm here with Dylan Bennett, Editor-in-Chief and acting publisher of the  Waterbury Bulletin . Dylan... I've heard reports, the police have discovered a kill list. That is correct, Lisa-Ann. Yes. Any idea, who's on that list? The police are keeping all that information to themselves. My sources tell me that Tom Winston made the cut. As did your wife, Sarah Bennett. Lisa-Ann : Is that true? Lisa-Ann, um... I... I can't comment... on that, at this time. Well, assuming my information is correct, can you think of any reason why Sarah would be a target? Tom Winston is a murderer, but what did Sarah do... to be on The Executioner's radar? Why don't we talk about what we do know? That the one outstanding sin is pride. And as you may or may not know, Lisa-Ann, pride is the cardinal sin. The most serious sin because it steals away from God's righteous glory. (CAR ACCELERATING) (SIREN WAILING) This must be a lot more exciting than your usual milk run, huh? What's going on, anyway? Everyone's so on edge. Is it The Executioner? Sharma : I discovered who the final victims are. Sarah Bennett and... You see, there comes a time in every officer's life where he has to... come up against something. Something dangerous. Something where only the greatest can move forward. (GROANING) Something that's gonna define my career as an officer. It's gonna keep this town safe. My handcuffs are too tight. Sharma : I'm sorry, what? Cutting off the circulation in my hands. I expect better treatment than this. You think I feel sorry for you after what you did, you monster? It's okay. I got this. Now, Tom... Take it easy. You had a bad concussion. Why don't you just sit back and enjoy some of that sweet wat... (CHOKING) (SCREAMING) (CONTINUES SCREAMING) Tom! Stop! Paramedic : No. To answer your question, no, I don't expect you to feel sorry for me. 'Cause I sure as hell don't feel sorry for you. No! (SCREAMING) Paramedic : Stop! Tom : Say it again! Paramedic : Stop! Lisa-Ann : Now, before you get all angry and accuse me of ambushing you... In my defense... you kept a pretty key piece of evidence from me tonight. Maybe the fact that... my wife is on the kill list? Yeah, I can't imagine why I'd want to keep that to myself. It's news. I mean, it's horrible news, and I hope it all works out, but this is what we do. Excuse me. Uh, Sauvignon blanc for me and... whatever my friend here is drinking. Thanks. So the next time something like this happens... all you gotta do is be open and honest with me. That way we can work together. Instead of me getting all vindictive and pissed off. And territorial. Make sense? Not a lot makes sense anymore. My first husband was killed in a drive-by shooting. Wrong place at the wrong time. I warned him. But more importantly... I leveraged his death to get to where I am today. The fearless defender of the little guy. Now his parents and friends hate me, but... You know what? They live in a shitty suburb in Philadelphia, and I live in a 5,000-square foot condo in Central Park West. This book will put you on the map. But everything's got its price. Hold on, slow down. What, uh...? What book? Well, I soft pitched your book idea to my publishers this afternoon. And they ate it up. Contracts are being drawn up as we speak. So is this happening? (LAUGHS) Lisa-Ann : This is happening. Yeah. So stop being all broody and angry. And drink with me. 
 
 If I'm being honest, every problem I've had is that bitch's fault. Man : You gotta stop letting Amy mess with you. Woman : But she just doesn't get it. You're my husband. Sharma : Chief Henry? Come in. What's going on, Sharma? Sharma : Be on the lookout for Tom Winston. Tom Winston has escaped our custody. What the hell are you talking about, Sharma? Never mind. Just meet me at the station with Sarah. Did I hear that right? Tom's escaped? Yeah, come on. We gotta get you somewhere secure. Right now. Tom : Sarah. Sarah, go back upstairs. You sure about that, sport? She's the only thing stopping me from shooting you. Let me have the gun. Real slow. Let's have it! What do you want, Tom? I want you to come with me. So I can protect you. Cam's protecting me. And he's doing such a bang-up job. You're not safe, Sarah. Not in this house. So please. Come with me. I'm not letting you walk out of here. What's the alternative? I won't hurt her. You have my word. Your word's not worth sh1t. He won't, Cam. Trust me. Trust you? Tom is my father. Sarah : I wouldn't lie about something like this. Tom : Over... Let's go! Come on! You don't know, bitch... Get down on your goddamn knees! Cuff yourself. (CUFFS SNAPPING) Radio. Car keys. (SIGHS) You gotta be kidding me Where are they? (SIGHS) They're by the door. All right, then. (SIGHS) Let's go. (PANTING) Sarah : We shouldn't be out here, Tom. You're injured. Don't worry about me. I'm fine. (RAINING) (GROANS) So you still don't trust me, huh? Oh, I trust you. It's everybody else I got a problem with. (SNIFFS) I mean it, Tom. You're gonna end up back in prison. Worse. You still don't understand, do you? Understand what? I'd rather die than lose you. (STRUGGLING) Oh, come on! (PANTING) (DOOR OPENING) (SOFTLY) Oh, Sharma. You're handcuffed? You get strangled? Again? Yeah. Come on, get me out of here. So, we were doing this expose on youth drug addiction. Mm-hm. And this kid we lined up... He was an addict, supposed to be. But he hadn't used in a couple of days. There's no drama... in a clean meth head. So, I... got my assistant to score him some "ice". No. And I got nominated for a Peabody. Oh! That's bad. I mean, that's not "use your wife for a story," but that's... pretty bad. Okay. All right. Enough with the self-flagellation. Dylan : Mmm. Gone from being pretty pathetic to downright boring. Oh, you think they want us out of here? Yeah. Yeah, it's about that time, but I'm not boring. (LAUGHS) I'm... Mr. Fun. They call me Mr. Fun. You are boring. You know why? You lied to Sarah. Big whoop. Now, if she can't see past your betrayal or... your mistake... Then maybe you two aren't as in love as you thought you were. But what do I know? What do I know? In vino veritas. And I have certainly had a lot to drink. (LAUGHS) You have had a lot... Whoa! Whoa! Okay, there it is. Mm. Mm. Mm. Lisa. Lisa. I can't. I can't! Sarah... Sarah is dragging you down. Just like... Alison was. I'm gonna walk you back to your hotel. Okay? You know I'm right. You use Sarah, but she used you right back. It's like when somebody's drowning. You try and keep 'em afloat for a while, but... before you know it, you're both... sinking into the mud. (PHONE RINGS) Just give me a second. (SIGHS) Hello? Dylan, have you heard from Sarah? No, I thought she was with you. Dylan : What's going on? Just meet me at the station. What is it, The Executioner? I gotta go. Hey... When this story is done... I'm gone. You ever go camping, growing up? (CHUCKLES) Camping with Brenda? (LAUGHS) Yeah. Yeah. No, she did send me to camp once, though. Camp Motega. Brenda let you out of her sight. I'm surprised. Well, you know. Cam was a counselor there, so she knew I'd be safe. Yeah. You know, up until then, the only boats I had been on were the ones that take you from one Caribbean island to another. (LAUGHS) Right. So when I first got to camp, I headed straight for the canoes and jumped in and... You gotta keep your center of gravity as low as possible. Yeah, you know, walk along the main line. I know that now. (LAUGHS) I learned it the hard way. I would have taught you how to canoe. Tie a little paddle. Fish. How to start a campfire. (SIGHS) That would've been nice. Yeah. Do you regret coming back here? I thought if I could go back and face the past, I could come out the other side... home. Instead, I'm on the run from a serial killer with a killer. So... Well, when you put it that way. Yeah. Why did you kill them, Tom? Please, just tell me the truth. Don't! What are you so afraid of? I'm not afraid. I... I told you what happened. You don't want to believe me, then, fine. But I'm not gonna sit here and... (GROANING) Tom? (GASPING) Okay. Wait, wait. I'm calling 911, okay? Just... You're having a seizure. You need medical help, okay? 911 OPERATOR: 911. What's the emergency? Hello? Uh, yeah, see I was... Tom : No. 911 OPERATOR: Hello? What are you doing? (GRUNTING) (CHOKING) Tom? You need to get out of here. Sarah : Just... I'm gonna go find some help. He'll be able to trace you now. Okay. Just wait here. Don't worry, right? Tom : Don't. Don't? Okay. (CHOKING) You had one job, to protect Sarah. You just let her walk off with that monster. This is not... Don't touch me. Gonna help. We need to focus on finding Sarah. 'Cause, yes, Tom Winston is a monster. So where are they? Hold up, somewhere. Unless, they made it to the highway, which I don't think is likely. We closed down every road in and out of town the minute that Tom escaped. (PHONE RINGS) We gotta ping from Sarah's cell phone. Where? Just outside of town, near Wannick Creek. There's no GPS, so it's a broad area. Sharma, I want everyone out there searching for Sarah and Tom. Right now. Of course. Cam, let me help. I've got a car, good pair of eyes for a guy my age. All right. All right. But do not approach them. You see anything, you call me? Yeah. All right. I'm going, too. The same goes for you. You see them, you contact me. Understood? Yeah, chief. Understood. (CAR BRAKING) Hey! Hey! Hel... Help! (MUFFLED SCREAMING) (SAW REVVING UP) (GROANING) Sarah. Where are we? The punishment for pride... is being broken on the wheel. Why are you here? Why is she here? (SAW REVVING DOWN) He has rules. What was your sin? Tom : Why don't you tell me? I tried to kill myself. Sarah. Why would you...? Why? Because of you. One night, I took some pills. Took a lot of pills. Sarah was playing God. And, yes, that is prideful. But it was a sin she committed against herself, no one else. Let her go. Please. (SCREAMING) No! No, goddamnit! No! Let her go! No! Let her go! (SCREAMING) Take me! I'm the one who deserves to die! Tom : I know change takes time, but we are making a difference. Woman : Yes. Galatians 6:9. "And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap if we do not give up." Woman : Amen. Woman 2 : Amen. Do not listen... to the darkness that exists in our world today. (DOOR OPENING) Don't live your life... (DOOR CLOSING) (SIGHS) Uh, ma'am, you're a bit early. Uh, our evening service does not start until... 8:30. Actually... I heard about what you did, and it inspired me. Oh. Really, well, I'm... I'm glad. I've seen what the drugs, and... prostitution and pornography's done to this town. It sickens me. I wanna help. In any way that I can. Please take a seat at the pew. And join us. Tom : Now, Alan Henry is just a small part of a much bigger problem in Waterbury. And... (CLEARS THROAT) (SIGHS) Uh... Where was I? Uh... Tom : Right. The sins of this town... Of which there are many. I should go. Hey. Bryan won't be back until after dinner. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) Rachel : Hey. What's going on? You're a married woman, and it's wrong. It's... It's sinful. It's fun. It's alive. It's magic. For both of us. I love you. I do. I love you, Rachel. And... I want to spend the rest of my life with you. And we can. Leave Bryan. Come with me. Oh, I know. How difficult this is for you. Tom, just stop. Tom, please. You aren't in impossible situation. But love... is not easy, Rachel. I can't. I can't do this anymore. You hear me? I can't do this. (DOOR OPENING) It's okay. Geez! Bryan : Don't get up. It's cool, man. It's cool. Rachel. Why don't you go wash him off you? I'll take care of this mess. Look... Bryan, I didn't want it... I didn't want it to happen. I did... I did... We fell in love, and then... Okay, it's cool, man. Just calm down, all right. We're in love, and I... Tom! Tom! I told you, it's cool, man. Don't have a coronary. Okay, look, here, I'm gonna... gonna turn around. You can put your clothes back on, okay? So? How was she? (SHOWER RUNNING) What? Rachel, in the sack, man. Did you like being with her? I know you did, but what... What was your favorite part? Or should I say "parts"? I'm gonna... I'm just... I'm gonna go. No, you're not! Sit down. (SHOWER RUNNING) I... will tell you... when you can go. So it's the boobs? Yeah, Rachel's got a great rack, and they're natural, too. Which is very rare, in this business. Business? What are you...? What are you talking about? Bryan : You're a natural, too, Tom. Though, you might want to tone down that love sh1t. (SIGHS) My friend, um... Alan Henry? Yeah, he gets the videos out there for us. He distributes them. But lately, you... have been giving us a very hard time, haven't you? I'm doing... I'm doing God's work. Really? (CHUCKLING) This... is God's work, Tom, huh? Bryan : Okay, so here's how it's gonna go down. Rachel and me... We're gonna keep this between the three of us. And all you gotta do... is stop getting in the way. Bryan : Great. Thank you, Tom. I have... one last question for you. All that love stuff with Rachel... Did you really mean that? Yeah. All of it. (SLICING SOUNDS) So says the Lord. (DISTORTED VOICE) Says the Lord. Righteous. "And deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed." (DISTORTED VOICE) Robbed. Robbed. "You're shed blood of the innocent." (DISTORTED VOICE) Innocent blood. Innocent. Innocent. (DISTORTED VOICE) Execute. "I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes." (DISTORTED) Wrathful rebukes. Wrathful rebukes. As Christians, it is our duty, our burden, to take action against sin, wherever we may find it. I wasn't doing God's work. There was no higher purpose. It was my ego. My wounded pride that drove me to murder them. You don't need to do this. You can let her go! (HEAVY BREATHING) (SCREAMING) No! Goddamnit! (GRUNTING) (CHOKING) Please tell me, I'm the sinner. Take me. Let me die for her! (WHIMPERING) (SAW REVVING DOWN) Now, let her go! (REGULAR VOICE) Executioner : I let her go. What? You don't have to do this. Yes. I do. I love you, Sarah. Give me your word, no harm will come to her. Then, I'm ready. Now, get her out of here. Sarah : No. I'm not leaving you to die alone. Man : Excuse me, coming through. You guys. Sarah. Sarah. Are you okay? Did he hurt you? Sarah : You stay away from me, okay? What do you mean, Sarah? You stay the hell away from me! You lying b*st*rd! Hey! Back off, Bennett! (BIRDS CHIRPING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SIGHS) (COUGHS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (GASPS) (POLICE SIREN WAILING) (POLICE SIRENS CONTINUE) Sarah, get back! Sarah! Cam : Stop! Sarah, don't touch it. That's evidence. (TEARING ENVELOPE) "The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked, and men will say, "Surely, there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on Earth." He thinks this is over. It's not even close to being over. Good morning. And what a beautiful morning it is. It's like when a storm has passed and everything is bright and new. Uh, I'm gonna grab a couple of hours of shut-eye. It's over, Cam. This town has been cleansed. And the Lord said in His heart, "Never again will I curse the ground for man's sake. Nor will I again destroy every living thing as I have done." Amen.
