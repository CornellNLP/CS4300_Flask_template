 [Grunts] 
 Woman :  Previously on  Slasher... 
 [Gasps] Oh... 
 Why would The Executioner send me Verna McBride finger? 
 Verna McBride had a lot of enemies. It's a smokescreen. 
 Sarah : The Executioner sent me this. 
 Those are geographical coordinates. 
 We found ID on the remains. 
 It's Peter McBride, isn't it? 
 So, Peter McBride is with Rachel and Bryan almost every night. 
 Verna discovered what her husband was doing, she snapped. 
 Tom : Verna McBride died with some anger. 
 This all goes back to the Bible. 
 Why does he kill some people, but let others go? 
 He or she is smart, a magician, and you're looking over here... 
 What are you doing here? 
 Oh, there's a card in there. 
 "My condolences on your loss." 
 ... while he was killing over there. 
 [Groaning] 
 Sarah : Justin? 
 We've only just scratched the surface, haven't we? 
 There's so much more to uncover, trust me. 
 [♪ '50s Doo-Wop in car stereo] 
 This is a classy event. 
 Like my father says, rock and roll music is like listening to the drums of deepest, darkest Africa. 
 Your dad hasn't been past Simcoe. What does he know about Africa? 
 All I'm saying is, who needs Mick Jagger and that awful tongue of his, when you've got Frankie Valli or the Beach Boys? 
 Have you ever really listened to  Pet Sounds  by the Beach Boys? 
 It's far more psychedelic and in the world of Jefferson Airplane and the Who... 
 But I think Frankie Valli's groovy. 
 [Insects chirring] 
 [Vehicle approaching] 
 Girl : If you think about it, if you really weigh the pros and cons, the choice for prom queen is obvious. 
 The girls look to me as the head of the Collegiate Club, the boys look to Ronnie as Athlete of the Year. 
 Ada, I can count on your vote, right? 
 Ada? 
 Are you still with us? 
 Sorry. 
 Why are you such a kook tonight? 
 I feel guilty. 
 You have nothing to feel guilty about. 
 All she talked about was the prom, and now I'm the one here and she isn't... 
 And I shouldn't have come tonight. 
 I should've just stayed home, like I planned. 
 Ada, your former best friend doesn't know when to close her mouth or her legs. 
 Does she, Ronald? 
 No. No, she doesn't. 
 [♪ Discordant instrumentation] 
 So stop feeling guilty and have fun. 
 Who would her prom date even be? 
 Half the football team? Coach MacMillan for good measure? 
 She's our friend. 
 No, she's a slut. 
 [Loud crash] 
 [Girls scream, sobbing] 
 Ronald : We need some help! 
 Girl : Help! 
 Hey, everyone! Help! 
 [Sobbing, indistinct yelling] 
 [Medical ventilator pumping] 
 [Machine beeping] 
 [Brenda quietly sobs] 
 I'd switch spots with you in a second, Ada. 
 Really, I would. 
 [♪ Mournful orchestral] 
 [Robin sniffles] 
 It was a beautiful service. 
 Robin can take a little comfort in knowing that Justin was loved by a lot of people. 
 He'll be missed. 
 Jesus, you make it sound like a popularity contest. 
 I... I'm sorry. 
 You know, you haven't been sleeping, babe. 
 Maybe we should go to a doctor, get some pills. 
 I can't take those, Dylan. 
 Well, you gotta do something. 
 I just keep thinking... 
 You know, what if I'm next? 
 Sarah. 
 This all happened when we came back to town. 
 You don't think I might be a target? 
 Listen, this guy's crazy. 
 I don't know what to think. 
 Nobody does, okay? 
 Okay, babe. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Hey. How's Robin? 
 Yeah, not good. 
 I'm sorry I couldn't be there. 
 No, it's fine. You got more important things to do. 
 I've arranged to have a police officer parked out front of your house 24/7. 
 Not that I think there's any threat... 
 ... just so you can stop worrying. 
 Thanks. Yeah, we appreciate it. 
 Hi, everybody. Last night, about 19:30... 
 An adult, age 40, Heather Louise Peterson of Waterbury, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the death of Justin Faysal. 
 Mr. Mayor, Dylan Bennett from the  Waterbury Bulletin. 
 Is there anything connecting Heather Peterson to the murder of Verna McBride? 
 That's our belief, yes. 
 Chief Vaughn will talk you through the particulars of our current investigation. Chief? 
 Thank you, Mr. Mayor. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, an autopsy was performed on Mr. Faysal yesterday. 
 The cause of death... 
 Jana Singer, from  Collingwood Expositor. 
 Why would Heather Peterson kill him? Do you have a motive? 
 We have evidence from an eyewitness of a personal vendetta towards Mr. Faysal over a business transaction. 
 We also recovered a large quantity of rat poison at the Peterson residence. 
 What other evidence do you have connecting Heather to Verna's murder? 
 That investigation is still ongoing. 
 Because I'm having a hard time figuring out why she would chop up an old woman into little pieces. 
 I want to assure the citizens of Waterbury and its many visitors that this was not random, and we do not expect any more violence. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Unbelievable. 
 You know she's right? 
 What if Heather's... ? 
 Stop, babe. You gotta stop, okay? 
 You're gonna drive yourself crazy. 
 If they're wrong, then, The Executioner's still out there. 
 Oh, wow. 
 You would not recognize Gail if you passed her on the street. 
 Big as a house. 
 Oh, a retired teacher, never married. 
 [Door opens] 
 Well, guess she loved food too much to ever let a man in her life. 
 Wow. Who's next? 
 Oh, what about that boy that you had a crush on in Bio? 
 Sonja : She can't hear you. 
 You don't know that. 
 Yes, I do. 
 The night of the accident, a piece of her skull sliced right down into her brain. 
 So she can't eat, can't talk, can't breathe on her own... 
 ... and she certainly can't hear you. 
 But to answer your question, the boy she had a crush on was Harry Dahl. 
 Right. Harry "Dull." 
 God, she hated it when I called him that. 
 Harry's some kind of a computer guru in California, worth millions. 
 Anyway, I'm here to spruce Ada up. 
 I come by every other week. 
 Oh, Sonja, do you remember when Ada wanted to look like Twiggy, and she asked us to do her makeup? 
 And she wanted those big false eyelashes? 
 [Laughing] We kept gluing her eyelids shut. 
 Brenda, why are you here? 
 Because Ada was my best friend. 
 A best friend that you never visit. 
 I live three hours away. 
 I'm talking about before you left. 
 Oh. 
 Okay, sure. Fine, you're right. 
 I'm a terrible friend, guilty as charged. 
 What else do you want me to say? I'm here now. 
 I'm trying to make up for lost time, now. 
 Well, for who? For Ada? 
 She has no idea that you're here. And if it's for me, I'm not interested. 
 We used to be friends, Sonja. 
 Yep, we did. 
 But I don't have the capacity to help you clear your conscience. 
 You really have to get over something that happened decades ago. 
 I'm not the one looking for absolution. 
 Too bad that hunk of cement didn't fall a little more to the left. 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 [Door opens] 
 Hello. 
 Welcome. 
 Feel free to look around. 
 Thank you. 
 If you have any questions... 
 Ask you? 
 You're Sarah, I take it. 
 [Pulsating orchestration] 
 Yeah. 
 How did you... ? 
 Chamber of Commerce website. 
 I always research the places I visit. 
 I bought a cottage up here last spring... 
 But I can't live with blank walls. 
 [Throbbing] 
 [Stammers] Actually, that's not for sale. 
 No, I don't imagine there'd be much of a need for a painting like that in this neck of the woods. 
 Still, it's rather striking. 
 [Discordant instrumentation] 
 Who's the artist? 
 Really, it's just something... 
 It shouldn't even be out. 
 I'll take the collage. 
 Dylan : Hello, this is  the cell phone of Dylan Bennett. 
 Please leave a message.  
 [Beeps] 
 Dylan, it's Sarah. I swear, your wife is losing it. 
 I nearly broke a customer's nose today and turned him into a eunuch, and he wound up buying six paintings off me, so, yeah... 
 Listen, I know Cam has got a guy outside, but I would feel so much better if you were here too. 
 So, you know, come home soon. 
 I miss you. 
 [Urgent atonal instrumentation ] 
 Woman on phone : This is what you think I  expect in a real estate agent. 
 I need better than this...  
 Robin : I understand you're upset. 
 The buyer is within the 10-day cooling off period for a timeshare. 
 [Sighs] It's the law, Miss Seferian, not an oversight on my part. 
 You're  not doing  what I asked you to do. 
 These have been inconvenient for me. 
 Yes. You know what? 
 These murders have been a big inconvenience for all of us! 
 [Robin sighs] 
 Your husband sent me a check, and it bounced. 
 Fine. 
 Fine, I'll just... I'll... 
 I'll write you another one. 
 Or can I just... ? Can I just give you cash? 
 Robin, it's for a quarter million dollars. 
 It's a down payment for my hunting lodge. 
 Oh, he never told you. 
 Jesus! 
 Justin makes... 
 Justin made all the business decisions. 
 You wanna cut me some slack here? 
 Tell you what, you talk to your banker, your lawyer, you get me another check, one that doesn't bounce, tomorrow. 
 [Pulsing instrumental] 
 [Door shuts]

 Chino, your finest single malt. 
 Ed. 
 Mr. Mayor. 
 Brenda. 
 Ronald. 
 Join me. 
 I've gotta get home. 
 Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter. You just ordered a drink. 
 Come here. 
 Well, well. 
 Look at you. 
 [Panting] Oh, God... 
 Ronald : Oh, God. Oh, my God... 
 God, Sonja and I have not had s*x in so long, I can't remember. 
 I don't wanna hear about Sonja. 
 Oh, my God... 
 [Brenda moans] 
 No, it's all right. 
 I have rubbers. 
 Not that it matters now. 
 No. 
 [Gasps] Oh, God, oh... 
 Oh, my God. You are as beautiful now, as you were when we were teenagers. 
 What's wrong? 
 [Breathes heavily] 
 Don't, no. 
 What's wrong? What's wrong? Tell me. 
 What's going on? 
 Sonja's waiting. 
 No, no, she... She knows I work late. 
 Ronnie, don't. 
 Come on. 
 You know you want this as bad as I do. 
 Ronnie, your ass feels like a ripe cauliflower, you've got as much hair on your back as you do on your head, and that dick of yours has always been two sizes too small. 
 So, no, I really do not want this. 
 Radio announcer : The Australian  power hitter steps up to the wickets,  stared down by their premier bowler. 
 Let's go, let's go... 
 What a find he once was...  
 [Gagging, choking] 
 [Desperate gasps] 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 [Sighs] 
 Hello? 
 Is anybody there? 
 Okay, I'm hanging up now. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Okay, so here's what's gonna happen. 
 I am gonna stand up, and I am gonna walk outside, and I'm gonna go to the very big, burly cop... 
 Distorted voice : Sarah... Sarah...  
 [Breathes heavily] 
 Brave, stupid Sarah. 
 [Phone rings nearby] 
 [Atonal instrumental] 
 [Phone continues ringing] 
 [Floor creaks] 
 [Urgent percussion]

 [Yelps, grunts]

 [Dissonant chords jangling] 
 [Orchestration fades out] 
 Cam : Sarah! 
 Sarah! 
 Where are you? 
 Cam? 
 Cam, is that you? 
 Sarah, call out to me! 
 I'm here! 
 I'm here, please, come help me... 
 [Cam whispers] Hey... 
 It's okay, it's okay... 
 It's okay, it's okay. I got you. 
 [Sarah sobs] 
 [Indistinct police chatter] 
 When I finished my shift, I drove by to check in on things on my way home, and I found Constable Sharma on the ground out cold. 
 Okay, what about the phone call? 
 We traced the number to Verna McBride's cell. 
 The phone was missing at the murder scene. 
 So then it's The Executioner for sure. 
 This is not The Executioner. 
 This is whoever killed Mrs. McBride. 
 Stop bullshitting and just call it what it is. 
 Dylan, you're upset. 
 Yeah, I'm upset, man. 
 He was in our house. 
 We can't stay here. 
 All right, that's it. 
 Let's hit the road. Let's go. 
 Brenda, can you please... ? 
 Can you just... ? 
 Dylan, I am so tired of biting my tongue and worrying about your... 
 Really? When have you done either? 
 I don't think I was there. 
 Enough! 
 If you would like to stay at a hotel, we will put you up at a hotel. 
 If you would like to stay with a friend or a relative, or if you'd like to stay here tonight, I will park my own ass outside. 
 Whatever you like, okay? 
 Dylan, you're not going back to work? 
 No, babe, of course not. 
 Okay, we'll stay here tonight, and leave in the morning. 
 Okay. 
 Why don't you go inside and try and get some rest? 
 Cam. 
 Yeah. 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 You Owen's kid? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Last time I saw you, you were barely up to my knees. 
 But look at you now. 
 Ma'am, you should probably head inside. It's safer. 
 Good night, Mrs. Merritt. 
 Thank you, Officer. [Chuckles softly] 
 [Dissonant orchestration] 
 Sarah : Cam says Vaughn won't release Heather. 
 Says she's still the main suspect. 
 Right. So, what? Heather teleported herself from the jail to your house? 
 No, according to Vaughn, last night could've been a prankster. 
 Oh, a prank. Right. It's funny. 
 You should leave town, too. 
 How? 
 I've got the business and the house and... 
 I'm meeting up with my lawyer later to unravel Justin's will, which is a complete mess. 
 [Sighs deeply] 
 I just don't understand, you know? 
 Why Justin? 
 What'd he do? 
 I can tell you what he didn't do. 
 He didn't blow someone's brains out with a hunting rifle. 
 Well, something must have put him on The Executioner's radar. 
 You can't think of anything? 
 Robin? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Before we built our house, there was a family that lived on that land in some nasty little shack that had no right being there. 
 Justin bought the land and... 
 ... bulldozed everything. 
 Robin : I guess the family wound up... squatting in some abandoned  old house over on McCaul Street. 
 The house didn't have  any heating or electricity,  so they used this propane heater as a makeshift furnace. They suffocated. 
 It's not like Justin put a gun to their head, he didn't... 
 He just bought their land. That's it, you know? 
 He didn't deserve to die because of that. 
 No. No, of course not. 
 I mean, he didn't... He didn't know. 
 Of course. 
 He didn't deserve to... 
 You know, and after last night, Sarah wants to get the hell out of here. 
 And, frankly, I don't blame her. 
 Okay, if I was in Sarah's shoes, I'd be on the next flight to Australia or some remote island in... 
 As far away from here as possible... 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 ... so I get it. 
 But... you have to understand what you're giving up. 
 What do you mean? 
 Have you seen this? 
 The story you wrote about Heather after her arrest? 
 It's been picked up by every major news agency in this country. 
 Right now, this story is sitting on page 5 or 6 of the nationals. 
 A couple strange murders in a town nobody's heard of. It's interesting. 
 One more murder, and I promise you, we hit critical mass. Boom. 
 It sounds like you want The Executioner to strike again. 
 Murders sell papers. Serial killers make careers. 
 This kind of story... Opportunity... 
 Only comes once in a journalist's career, if they're lucky. 
 But... 
 ... Sarah comes first. 
 I'll respect whatever decision you make. 
 [Dylan sighs] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 We packed all we need for now. I spoke to Doug across the street. 
 He's gonna keep an eye on the place and collect the mail. 
 Okay, that's great... Can I talk to you for a second? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh... 
 Hey, why don't I go get the rest of the bags? 
 Thank you. 
 What's going on? 
 Alison wants two weeks' notice. 
 Yeah, like a minimum of two weeks. 
 You're not coming. 
 No, I'm gonna come. 
 I can't come right now. 
 Okay. When? 
 The hope is Chief Vaughn will get off his ass and catch the killer, right? 
 So nobody has to go anywhere. 
 Dylan, we have more than just a mouse problem or a moldy basement. 
 I know, I know. I know you're upset. I get it. 
 You want me to come with you, and I wanna get out of here, too, trust me. But I signed a contract, okay? She could sue me. 
 So I don't really know what to do here. 
 You don't know? You could tell Alison to shove her two weeks up her ass. 
 Two weeks max. 
 And if she finds a replacement before then, I'm gonna be with you, I promise. 
 Brenda : We packed a bag for you. 
 He's not coming. 
 Oh, really? Well, I'm not taking the bag back in. 
 Dylan can take it. 
 Want me to drive? 
 My hands... are tied here, babe. 
 I wish you would understand. 
 Dylan : Sarah... 
 Call me, all right? Let me know you got there safe. 
 Brenda : You wanna talk about what happened? 
 No. 
 You can dress 'em up in designer jeans, you call slather them in 100-dollar face creams, he's still just a caveman underneath. 
 Look, I'm just saying... 
 You know, if you two were ever to break up, God forbid, you wouldn't stay single very long. 
 [Scoffs] What are you talking about? 
 Really? [Groans] 
 I'm talking about that Marlboro Man back in Waterbury. 
 Cam? 
 Oh, so you have noticed him. Uh-huh. 
 No, Cam and I are old friends. 
 [Chuckles] Not sure he'd describe you that way. 
 And he's married... You know what? 
 Why are we even talking about this? 
 The point is, Dylan's not the be all and end all. 
 And the way Cam was looking at you? Mm, mm... 
 [Engine roaring] 
 [Sarah yelps] 
 [Tires screech, engine revs] 
 [Sarah gasps] 
 Sarah, sweetheart, are you okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, okay. Are you? 
 Yeah. 
 We... We need to get out of here before he comes back for me, okay? 
 Who? 
 Who do you think? 
 [Engine stalls] 
 No, no, no! sh1t, sh1t, sh1t! 
 Sarah : What the... ? 
 You think I'd return to this shit-hole without packing a little heat? 
 Grandma, don't... 
 Brenda  (muttering): Scumbag, asshole, pile of sh1t... 
 [Tires squealing] 
 [Discordant instrumental] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Every time I get a bar, it disappears. 
 Keep trying. 
 I know why this is happening. 
 Why The Executioner's targeting us. 
 Because... 
 It's my fault. 
 You know, I gave up. 
 I tried to kill myself and that's... a sin. 
 No... Oh, baby. 
 It's true, though. I destroy everything. 
 No... 
 No, you don't. [Sobs] 
 This is me. 
 This is my fault. 
 My friend Ada... 
 The one in the nursing home? 
 She's in there... 
 She's the way she is because of me. 
 I didn't mean to hurt her. 
 Ronnie and me, we'd fallen in love, right? 
 Ronald Edwards. 
 Grandma? 
 What did you do? 
 The night of our prom... 
 Brenda : I wanted to hurt Sonja... so I waited on that bridge. And when they drove by, I...  I was aiming for the driver. 
 [Girls screaming] 
 [Sobbing, shouting slowly fades] 
 Ada wasn't supposed to be there. 
 She wasn't even supposed to be in the car. 
 No. 
 When we go back to Waterbury, you are going to the police, and you're gonna tell them the truth. 
 Sarah, no. 
 No. 
 Come on. I have lived with this my entire life. 
 With the guilt and with hating myself. 
 I have paid my dues, and I refuse to go to jail for the rest of my life... 
 ... for a mistake. 
 A mistake I made as a teenager. 
 A mistake? 
 It's attempted murder. 
 Oh, Sarah... 
 We're in danger. 
 Yeah... 
 ... because of you. 
 [Atonal instrumentals] 
 [Atonal instrumental intensifies] 
 Man : Okay, so, we'll take care of that for you. Right. 
 Um... 
 As you know, Justin remortgaged the house, twice, to pay off your other debts. 
 [Sniffles] 
 No, I... I didn't know that. 
 Oh. 
 That means you're under water to the tune of half a million on the house alone. 
 Your husband, against my advice, was robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
 [Clears throat] Um... 
 How much did he owe? 
 You owe over $2.8 million. 
 [Clears throat] Those were Justin's deals. He... 
 He said he'd take care of the business stuff, and I would, you know, focus on... 
 ... selling homes. It's what... It's what I did. 
 Well, as Justin's husband, you inherit all of his debts. 
 But the good news, and there is good news here, Robin, is that Justin left everything to you. 
 You can sell it, sell all of it, and I mean everything. 
 The house, the downtown properties, that car, the furniture... 
 Our whole life together. 
 Sell all of that, and you may come close to breaking even. 
 [Exhales, clears throat] 
 [Sniffles] 
 I need to ask you one more question. 
 The family that died in that house over on McCaul, is there anything underhanded that Justin did? 
 Please... 
 I need to know. 
 Justin knew someone who knew someone on City Council who had the land rezoned. 
 The Vickers family couldn't afford the tax hike, so they had to sell at a great price, and... 
 It wasn't illegal, Robin. 
 No. 
 No, it was just business. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Crow cawing] 
 Grandma? 
 Grandma! 
 [Branches snaps] 
 Okay. Come on, dickhead. 
 Come get me. 
 I'm armed and dangerous, asshole. 
 [Muffled shouting] 
 Grandma? 
 Grandma, where are you? 
 [Cacophonous dissonant chords] 
 [Insects chirring]

 [Gasps] What... ? 
 [Whimpers] 
 [Groans] 
 [Brenda gasps] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Pulsating percussions] 
 [Tempo speeds up] 
 You sick piece of sh1t. 
 I'm not afraid of you. 
 You never read the Bible? Huh? 
 "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone." 
 [Gasps] 
 You skip over that section? 
 I know what I did... 
 And I know I'm going to hell for it. 
 But I'll see you there, pal... 
 ... because you're just as bad as I am. 
 Only worse. 
 You're a coward. 
 No, please! No, please! 
 Please, no! Please don't! No! No, please... 
 [Wails] No, please, no... !

 [Water gently lapping] 
 Can you feel your feet on the ground, Sarah? 
 I'm going to touch you now. 
 Can you feel my hand? 
 Cam : Hi. You okay? 
 Come here. 
 I'm gonna find him, Cam... 
 ... and I'm gonna kill him. 
 [Dark orchestral] 
 Trent! 
 You home? 
 [Pulsating orchestral] 
 Trent? 
 [Flies buzzing] 
 [Dissonant tones swell] 
 [Atonal chords clashing] 
 Killed all those animals myself. 
 [Exhales loudly] 
 Even that snake. 
 The way I see it, an animal walks into my land... 
 It's on, no matter what hunting season it is. 
 That ain't public knowledge, of course. 
 You never know when you might have a... 
 ... mole from the Ministry snooping around. 
 I... I knocked on the cabin door. 
 Oh, and when I didn't answer, you just decided to waltz on in here? 
 You're... 
 You're busy, so I'm gonna... 
 I'm gonna... I'm gonna come back. 
 I'll call ahead next time. 
 Yeah, why don't you do that? 
 If you're coming here to back out of a legally-binding deal, you could do me the courtesy of picking a convenient time. 
 Sure. 
 What do you think? 
 Sure. 
 Yeah? 
 I mean, I thought you guys were known for your manners, huh? 
 Your etiquette? 
 Hey, fancy boy. 
 Huh, am I wrong? Huh? 
 Just making sure you got my number. 
 Shall I write that down for you? 
 I'll Google it. 
 You know, every man has a flaw. 
 My husband's was he was weak. 
 Just spineless. 
 But yours is you only see what you wanna see. 
 Your eyesight is 20/20, but it can't look inside to where the truth is. 
 It needs to be felt, known. 
 Thank you for that, Mrs. Peterson. It was interesting. 
 Why don't I take you inside, hm? 
 But I see you. 
 Glowing... 
 Let's get you inside. 
 Oh, yeah... 
 Make sure you lock the door from now on, okay? 
 So that's it? Huh? 
 I mean, just let her walk right back into that hellhole? 
 She's not our problem anymore, Cam. We got bigger issues than her. 
 Besides, she's bat-shit crazy. 
 [Medical ventilator pumping] 
 Before my grandmother died, she confessed something to me. 
 Something terr... 
 Something... God, I actually don't know how to say this... 
 She did this to Ada? 
 Yes. 
 I thought you should know... 
 Both of you. 
 I always wondered, but I never thought that she could actually... 
 There's something else... 
 My grandmother also said that... 
 ... she and your husband were... 
 Were intimate. 
 I don't see how that's important, or, frankly, any of your business. 
 If your husband is my grandfather, I have a right to know. 
 He's not. 
 Are you sure? 
 I'm 100 percent sure. 
 I'm sorry for upsetting you. That wasn't my intention. 
 Just so you know... 
 I'm gonna go to the chief of police and tell him everything that happened. 
 This town has enough secrets. 
 [Cell door buzzes] 
 [Door unlocks] 
 Sarah, I'm so sorry for your loss. 
 [Door shuts] 
 Thank you. 
 Are you okay? Is there anything I can... ? 
 You can help me catch this b*st*rd. 
 Yeah, the punishment for envy is drowning. 
 And my grandmother was the most jealous, envious person I ever met. 
 You know, before she died, she confessed something to me. 
 That attack on... 
 On Ada Pavlovik, years ago... 
 It was her. 
 He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy. 
 Confession frees us, Sarah. 
 Once we let go of our secrets, their power over us disappears. 
 Your grandmother held onto that secret for years. 
 So take comfort knowing that she died, if not with a clear, then, at least a clearer conscience. 
 What is it? 
 You could've died out there. 
 No. You know, actually, I don't think I could've. 
 He could've killed me multiple times, but he never did. 
 I'm not a target. 
 I... 
 I don't deserve to die. 
 I'm safe. 
 So you can help me catch him. 
 I'm not a cop, Sarah. 
 Better. You're a murderer. 
 You know how all the colors in the rainbow, if you shine them together, they produce a pure white light? 
 Yeah? 
 Lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy... 
 They all come together to form darkness. 
 The cardinal sin, pride. 
 Whoever's doing this is blinded by their own pride, and pride will be their downfall. 
 How? 
 [Flies buzzing] 
 Tom :  The Executioner  is lost in zealotry,  in playing God, in pride...  But pride can blind us  and cause us to make mistakes. 
 And one day soon,  The Executioner will slip,  will step out of the shadows, and that's all it'll take  for you to catch your killer.
