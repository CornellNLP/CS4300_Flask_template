 Milo, where are you? 
 Announcer : Previously on "Slasher". 
 [GASPS] Oh, God. 
 [SCREAMING] 
 Lisa-Ann : A series of bloody murders... two journalists, Dylan Bennett and Alison Sutherland. 
 Why don't we ask The Executioner himself? 
 Please talk to me. Let me interview you. 
 I mean, call me crazy, but throwing yourself to the lions does seem a little prideful. 
 [CRICKETS CHIRPING] 
 [METAL DOOR CLANGS] 
 You have no sins? 
 No, nothing. 
 Alison : Ariel Peterson's disappearance was big news, but with no new leads the story started to die a slow death. 
 So... 
 I made sure it stayed live. 
 Benny Peterson... 
 All the facts pointed to him, but there was no smoking gun. 
 So I provided one. 
 [ALISON WHIMPERS] 
 [ALISON SCREAMS] 
 You can't do this! No! 
 Cam : She got in the car. 
 sh1t. 
 Girl : Itsy bitsy spider... 
 Don't stop singing, Ariel. It's beautiful. 
 Ariel : You're like a totally different person when you're around your friends. 
 You are, Larkwood. 
 You're mean, and you're cold, and you act like you don't care about anything. 
 Especially me. 
 No! 
 No, just stay there. I don't want to see you right now. 
 [SNIFFLING] 
 Yeah, have fun at your party, asshole! 
 [TURNS OFF PHONE] 
 [CONTINUES SNIFFLING] 
 [RETCHES] 
 [COUGHING] 
 [RETCHES] 
 [AMBULANCE STOPS] 
 Ah, looks like somebody just yawned a big, bright, chunky rainbow. 
 Looks like the Peterson girl. 
 You okay, Hun? 
 Trent : Can you walk? 
 I think so. 
 Trent : Yeah? 
 All right, here's what you're gonna do. 
 You're gonna go straight home, you're gonna drink a bucket of water, and take two aspirin, and jump into bed. 
 Not gonna die. You'll just think you did. 
 Shouldn't we drive her home or take her to emerg...? 
 Hold her hand for three hours, until she sobers up? 
 [RETCHES] 
 Trent : Let her walk it off. 
 Hey... 
 If you want me kept up all night, June bug, it's gonna be because of you. 
 [ENGINE RUNNING] 
 She'll be fine. 
 She'll be fine. 
 No. 
 Wait! 
 Come back! 
 [WHIMPERS] 
 Vaughn : You're Ariel, right? 
 You been drinkin'? 
 No. 
 Vaughn : That's all right. I'm off-duty. 
 I don't care how many shots of jãger you did or with who. 
 I just wanna make sure you get home safe and sound. 
 [CRICKETS CHIRPING] 
 Go on. Get in. 
 I'll drive you home. 
 Thank you. 
 [SIGHS] 
 So where are all your friends? 
 At a party. 
 Vaughn : Why aren't you? 
 Ah! 
 Boy troubles, huh? 
 I got it. 
 How'd you know? 
 Well, for starters, you've been crying. 
 Vaughn : Drank far too much. 
 [SNICKERS] 
 And you're wandering around Waterbury at half past 11. 
 [ARIEL CHUCKLES] 
 Oh, we just live off of Greenwood. 
 Yeah, I figured you might wanna sober up some. 
 Unless, of course, your parents are cool with you drinking. 
 No. 
 Vaughn : I didn't think so. 
 I've been there, Ariel. 
 I had the girl of my dreams and... 
 I lost her. 
 What happened? 
 Connie Renn was her name. 
 Smart, quiet... 
 Beautiful. 
 Different, you know? 
 Unique. 
 A lot like you. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Vaughn : That was... That was 20 years ago. 
 Life just... life just goes on. 
 It's really easy talking to you, Ariel. 
 You, too. 
 You, uh... you know I meant what I said. 
 You remind me of Connie. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 I'm... I'm just like your boyfriend. 
 [LAUGHS] I'm just a... a total... idiot. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 No! Don't say that. 
 You're like a hero. 
 Yeah? 
 [SNICKERS] 
 [CRICKETS CHIRPING] 
 [SIGHS] 
 You think I'm a hero? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you know why girls date older guys? 
 It's because you mature so much faster. 
 I mean, you just leave us right in the dust. 
 I can just walk the rest of the way home, if that's easier. 
 No, no, no. Come on. It's okay. 
 [PANTING] 
 It's okay. 
 Ariel. 
 Please. 
 Please, I just wanna go home! 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. Shh. Shh. 
 Please, just let me go home now. 
 [SOBBING] 
 No! Please, no! 
 No! 
 No! 
 It's okay. 
 No! 
 All right! 
 No! No! 
 Stop! 
 Ariel : No! 
 Vaughn : It's okay! 
 Ariel : No! 
 Vaughn : Shh. Shh. 
 Ariel : Please, help! 
 Vaughn : Stay calm. Stay calm. 
 Ariel : Stop! 
 [SCREAMING] 
 Ariel : No! 
 [SIGHS] 
 Hey. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Come back here. 
 Jake needs breakfast. 
 Jake is asleep. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [CONTINUED SIGHS] 
 I could do this all day. 
 Lying here with you. 
 [SNIFFS] It's like heaven. 
 I think this is good. 
 Imagine if we had a real life together? 
 You... 
 Me... and Jake. 
 And Nancy. 
 You guys have always wanted kids. 
 Could be like this every day. 
 Gonna be late for work. 
 [SIGHS] 
 You know, when you talk like this, Ariel... 
 All you do is make me really upset. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [DOOR OPENING, CLOSING] 
 Is daddy mad at me? 
 [DOOR BEING LOCKED] 
 No, honey, of course not. 
 Just go back to sleep. 
 Poor Alison, huh? 
 From the frying pan into the fire. 
 Are you enjoying this, Dylan? 
 Half the town is getting sliced and diced. 
 No. I'm not enjoying this. 
 Still. 
 You know, it's worked out kinda well for you. 
 Alison's dead, and you're in charge. 
 I'm not in charge. 
 Sarah, I'm just trying to keep this thing a float here. 
 [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
 It's kinda sounding like an accusation. 
 No. 
 No, a... an accusation would be me... 
 Asking you where you were... 
 When Alison was murdered. 'Cause... you weren't here. 
 Right, a journalist killing an entire town, to put himself on the map. 
 It's a juicy story, isn't it? 
 You're unbelievable. 
 Well, you wasted no time moving in. 
 Someone's gotta hold down the fort. 
 Dylan... 
 This story is breaking... big! 
 And I wanna talk next steps. 
 So does Megyn Kelly. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 And dateline and 48 hours mystery. 
 Well, lucky for me, I got in on the ground floor. 
 What are you doing tonight for dinner? 
 Eating a sandwich, right here. 
 You can take an hour out and have dinner with me, like a civilized person. 
 Tell me the time and the place. 
 Well, there is only one place. How's, um, how's seven? 
 Perfect. 
 Looking forward to it. 
 [PHONE RINGING] 
 [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
 [DOORBELL RINGS] 
 Hey. 
 Can I come in? 
 What do ya want? 
 Look, I'm not here to fight, or upset you, or make anything worse. 
 But I think I found something out about Ariel. 
 Come on in. 
 Everything in this case has led directly back to Benny Peterson. 
 You see, not anymore, though. 
 Marjorie Travers has giving an interview to The Bulletin, where she says that she saw Ariel on Tecumseh street at 11:30. 
 Which makes her the last person to see Ariel alive. 
 Okay. 
 We now know that June and Trent saw her seven minutes later on Chariton Street. 
 Nah, that's impossible. 
 Chariton's like at least a 20-minute walk away. 
 Sarah : Exactly. 
 So either Ariel was in two places at once, or Majorie is lying... 
 About everything. 
 [CARS DRIVING PAST] 
 [SHUDDER] 
 I saw Ariel where I saw her and when I saw her. 
 What more do you need to know? 
 Benny Peterson was at The Legion that night. 
 That's right around the corner from where you said you saw Ariel. 
 Yeah, I know where The Legion is. 
 He left at 11:40 P.M. 
 And no one saw him again until the next morning. 
 That's because he was busy raping and murdering his daughter. 
 Cam : Well, we now know that's impossible. 
 So I'm gonna ask you again, Marjorie. 
 Are you sure... that's Ariel that you saw that night? 
 I was havin' a smoke, in front of the White Onion Tavern. 
 Ariel Peterson walked by me. 
 I know it was 11:30 'cause... 
 Karaoke night at The Onion had just... let out. 
 Starts 9:30, goes two hours. 
 Unless my math is wrong. 
 That'd put it at 11:30 P.M. 
 Well, thank you very much for your time, Marjorie. 
 Let's go. 
 You know, that someone like you gets to live and waste their life is wrong on so many levels. 
 Sweetheart... 
 Your mother might've been a whore, but at least she was fun. 
 [SNICKERS] 
 Uh, just... 
 Stay classy, Marjorie. 
 [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
 Sarah : I saw Ariel walk by. Blah, blah, blah. 
 She didn't see her. 
 She's unbelievable. I know, it's upsetting. 
 Upsetting? 
 Cam, she was 15. Okay? She was a child. 
 And I think how terrified she must've been. 
 I know, but, honestly, it's not your concern. 
 Sarah, you didn't even know Ariel. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Alison, Trent... June? 
 The Executioner targeted them. 
 Killed them because of their association with this girl. 
 When I think about what she must've gone through... 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 It almost makes me wonder where The Executioner is actually doing God's work. 
 What? 
 Marjorie's lying. 
 You know it, and I know it. 
 No. 
 Hey... 
 The other day... 
 Those things, all that sh1t I said... 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. Really, I'm sorry, too. 
 No. 
 No, you being here... 
 That's the one good thing that's happened this summer. 
 Okay, so, what's this one called? 
 A poodle! 
 Good. 
 And... this one? 
 I like the poodle better. 
 Well, that wasn't the question, little man. 
 Why do we have to learn about this? 
 Why? You love dogs. 
 I do, but they're out there, and we're in here. 
 [DOOR UNLOCKING] 
 Daddy! 
 Hey. 
 [PANTING] 
 Vaughn : Hey, how are you, buddy? 
 You doing your lessons? 
 Yeah. 
 Fun fact... 
 Did you know that poodle's don't shed, they have to get a haircut? 
 I didn't know that. 
 You know what? I got bit by a poodle once. 
 Right there, you can feel the... [GROWLS] 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Listen, buddy, I'm gonna put this away, okay? 
 And then you can tell me all about poodles later. 
 Okay, can't wait. 
 All right. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] Yeah. 
 Earlier, I upset you... 
 And I'm sorry. 
 [SNICKERS] 
 That's okay. 
 [SIGHS] 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 [SIGHS] 
 It's just that... 
 Jake started asking questions about the world. 
 And... 
 I don't know what to tell him. 
 You know, he's lived his entire life down here. 
 He's never played with any other kids. 
 He needs to go to a real school. 
 And how exactly do we do that? Ariel? Hm? 
 You just... You open that door and... 
 And what do we tell everyone? 
 Whatever you want me to say, I'll say it. 
 Whatever you want. 
 That's the thing, Ariel. 
 There's nothing we can say. 
 They're out of the fruit roll thingies that Jake likes. 
 I'll get them the next time I go to the store. 
 [SIGHS] 
 We're gonna die in here. 
 Oh, and, um, if you want anything, just write it down. 
 I got a mind like a sieve lately. 
 I can't remember anything. 
 Give me your keys. 
 All right. All right. 
 Here we are. Just... Take it easy. 
 Give me your keys! 
 Vaughn : All right. All right. 
 They're in my pocket, okay? 
 Just take it easy. 
 [PANTING] 
 Jake. 
 Go stand by the door. 
 Mommy? 
 Honey, just do what I say. 
 [PANTING] 
 You really think you're gonna have enough time to get away, Ariel? Huh? 
 Where you gonna go? 
 Who you gonna stay with, Ariel? 
 [GROANS] 
 Daddy! 
 Vaughn : Ariel! 
 Okay. Okay, come on. 
 Just keep running, baby. 
 Vaughn : Ariel! 
 No. 
 No! 
 Vaughn : Ariel! 
 Jason. 
 Daddy! 
 Jake! 
 Hey! 
 Ariel : Let him go! 
 Let him go! 
 Get downstairs. 
 I won't. 
 [SHUDDERING] 
 Hey, buddy. 
 Wow. [CHUCKLES] 
 Wow. 
 You're getting so big. 
 You're getting too big... 
 You're getting too big... For your dad to lug around. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm not going to jail, Ariel. 
 I'd rather die. 
 No, Iain. Please, just stop. 
 And if I die... 
 Iain, Iain, Iain, stop! 
 Get downstairs now! 
 Okay. Okay, okay. 
 [SOBBING] Okay, okay, okay. 
 Let him go. Let him go. 
 Jake. Jake, it's okay. 
 [SOBBING] 
 Please! 
 Vaughn : Come on, buddy. Go on downstairs. 
 Help us! Please! 
 Ariel : Help us! Please! 
 Ariel : Please! 
 Help us! 
 Vaughn : Come on! 
 Ariel : Help us! 
 Ariel : Help us! 
 Look, all I did was ask a witness a few questions. 
 Without floating it by me first! 
 Yeah, well I tried. 
 And you weren't here. And you weren't answering your phone. 
 Well, I would've said no. 
 What did Marjorie say? 
 Did you come up with anything new? 
 No. 
 The same old bullshit. 
 But this time her facts don't line up. 
 And we tried pressing her. 
 We? 
 [SCOFFS] 
 Jesus Christ, Cam, you just buried your wife a week ago. 
 You're gonna wanna watch what you're saying, sir. 
 And you're gonna wanna stop thinking with your dick and start thinking like a cop! 
 And until you can, I want you to go home! 
 Cam : Look, whoever took Ariel is a target now. 
 The same way June was. 
 That's my concern! 
 I want you to go home. 
 I want you to go home, Cam! Now! 
 Sir. 
 [DOOR OPENING] 
 [DOOR CLOSING] 
 [HITS DESK] 
 [RESTAURANT CHATTER] 
 What are you gonna have? 
 Well, it's a toss up between the osso bucco potato stack and the Chinese chicken salad with mandarin staples. 
 Welcome to 1996. 
 [GIGGLES] 
 Cheers. 
 To what? 
 The biggest story since Casey Anthony. 
 Yeah, well, I'm not sure everyone shares your enthusiasm. 
 Okay. 
 I think there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. 
 No. 
 No misunderstanding. You chose Alison over me. 
 But then she got her head deep-fried. 
 Okay. 
 So, then, how do I make it better? 
 What are you offering? 
 What do you want? 
 More money? 
 Done. 
 Airtime? 
 You'll be my go-to guy on this case. 
 We can talk about bringing you in on a permanent basis. 
 Why don't you come by my hotel? 
 We'll order a bottle. 
 Do a little career planning. 
 A book deal. 
 I'm sorry. What? 
 A book deal. 
 True crime. 
 All of the killings started 30 years ago. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 I'm not a publisher, Dylan. 
 You've published four books. 
 And you didn't write any of 'em. 
 You ready to order? 'Cause I know what I want. 
 
 
 
 [BUZZING] 
 [DOOR OPENING] 
 Sarah. This is unexpected. 
 You're not my father. 
 You may think you are or you may wanna think you are, but you're not. 
 Sarah, it's not a matter of thinking. 
 You know, if you honestly think I'm gonna start spending every father's day with you, you're insane. 
 You are my daughter. 
 No. 
 No, it's impossible. 
 And this... 
 This is not healthy. 
 Can we talk about this? 
 Good-bye, Tom. 
 Sarah, please. 
 [KNOCKING AT THE DOOR] 
 [TV CHATTER] 
 [KNOCKING CONTINUES] 
 Hold on. 
 Oh! 
 Hey! 
 In the mood for some company? 
 Get you a drink? 
 Cheers. 
 [EXHALES] 
 This job's gonna be the death of you. 
 Yeah. 
 [EXHALES] 
 What's this? 
 Oh! 
 That's nothin'. 
 Cut myself shaving. 
 With a machete? 
 [BOTH LAUGHING] 
 I, uh... 
 I hear Cam paid you a visit today. 
 Oh. 
 Him and that Bennett girl. 
 Yeah, doesn't she think she's all that. 
 Yeah. 
 [SIGHS] MARJORIE: Pretty thing, though. 
 Her mother was, too. 
 [SNIFFS] 
 That's why we hated each other. 
 Vaughn : Hm. 
 What did you tell 'em? 
 What I've always told anyone... 
 Who's asked about that night. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Don't worry. It's okay. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Things can get complicated, Marjorie. 
 You got caught in a lie. 
 I saw what I saw. 
 [SNICKERS] 
 I stick to my story. 
 Yeah, well, they're gonna be looking for inconsistencies in your story, and there gonna try and trick you. 
 They? [LAUGHS] 
 I mean, it's your investigation, right? 
 [SIGHS] 
 May not stay that way. 
 Well, don't worry, because you know what? 
 I am a very, very good liar. 
 And I'm a lot smarter than I look. 
 What was Ariel wearing that night? 
 I... I don't know. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 What was she wearing? [LAUGHS] 
 Really? 
 You remember what time karaoke was over, but you don't remember that? 
 Which way was she walking? North or south? 
 Or was she running? 
 She probably was running because she ended up on Chariton Street seven minutes later. 
 Oh. Look. Look. Just... 
 Just tell me what you want me to say... 
 And I'll say it! 
 I'll say it. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 Okay. 
 I got you a present. 
 [GASPS] I love presents. 
 I nicked that off some asshole. 
 Caught him with his pants down at the cruising spot at the Brickworks. 
 [SNIFFS] Is it good? 
 Only the best for you, baby. 
 Oh. 
 [MOANS] 
 [BREATHING DEEPLY] 
 [MOANS] 
 Oh. 
 Aw, sh1t, it's amazing. 
 Oh! 
 You're so good to me. 
 [CRYING] 
 Marjorie : Better than all the other... 
 People in this shithole. 
 [MOANS] 
 That's a good thing, girl. 
 [SNIFFLING] 
 I... 
 Iain. 
 [MUMBLING] 
 I'm... 
 It's... 
 It's hella... 
 It's really strong. 
 Did you? 
 Iain? 
 What did you do? 
 What have you done? 
 [MOANS] 
 [SOBBING] 
 [YELLING] 
 [SOBBING] 
 [BREATHING DEEPLY] 
 [SNIFFS] 
 Hey, preacher. 
 Done with that? 
 Thanks. 
 Please give that back. 
 A little light reading, huh? 
 What is it today? 
 Hand it back... now! 
 Blah, blah, blah. 
 [PRISONERS CHEERING] 
 [GROANING] 
 [SCREAMING] 
 [GROANS] 
 [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] 
 [SIGHS] 
 Marjorie Travers has been shooting smack since I was in little league. 
 I say we run the syringe for prints and do a sweep of the room. 
 Even long-time users make mistakes, Cam. 
 She probably got a hot load. 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe that's what this is. 
 Maybe it isn't. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [CRICKETS CHIRPING] 
 And you're positive it's Marjorie Travers? 
 Man on phone : Mm-hm. 
 100? 
 Man on phone : Yeah, we got the confirmation. 
 It's definitely her. 
 Yep, okay. Thank you. 
 They're saying it's an overdose. 
 How convenient. 
 Dylan : And you think it's a... 
 Of course. 
 Put you on the record? 
 On the record? 
 You're the last person to see Marjorie alive. 
 The police are saying one thing, you're saying another. 
 I'm sorry... 
 Are you asking if you can interview me? 
 Sarah, listen to me. 
 There's something going on here. And it's all tied back to Ariel. 
 Now, if one person reads this and remembers something from the night that Ariel went missing, we could crack this case. 
 Dylan, a woman I saw this afternoon is lying dead in a motel room because Cam and I got too close to something. 
 That's my point. 
 And instead of asking if I'm okay, you ask if you can interview me. 
 Fine! Fine! No interview. 
 How insensitive of me to try to help you find a missing girl, right? 
 Oh, great! Now I'm the bad guy. 
 You're classic. 
 [RUNNING WATER] 
 [CAR BRAKING] 
 What the hell are you doing out here all alone? 
 This time of night? 
 Just getting some air. 
 Come on. 
 I insist. Get in. 
 Fine. 
 Sorry my stuff's in the front. 
 You, uh... mind jumping in the back? 
 [OPENS DOOR] 
 [CLOSES DOOR] 
 [ENGINE STARTS] 
 Vaughn : So what were you doing out there? 
 I don't know. 
 You and Cam, your optimism is admirable. 
 Ariel's been missing for a few years now. 
 This isn't the first time I've had to tell you, Sarah. 
 This is police business, I know. 
 So please, just let it go. All right? 
 Can I be blunt? 
 Oh, I think you and I are well past blunt. 
 This entire investigation is based on lies. 
 Alison Sutherland lied, Marjorie Travers. 
 So, what, you think this is some big conspiracy? 
 Connect the dots. 
 I tell you what. 
 Why don't you connect them for me? 
 Okay. 
 Ariel Peterson walked home from a party. 
 By herself. 
 She gets into a car on Chariton Street, and that's the last time anyone ever saw her. 
 Sarah : Those are the facts. 
 Okay. 
 Now for the lies. 
 Alison Sutherland hacks into Benny Peterson's account and writes fake but incriminating e-mails that make it look like he murdered his daughter. 
 Then... 
 Marjorie Travers corroborates those e-mails by flat out lying about where Ariel Peterson was that night. 
 And then, today, Marjorie Travers conveniently overdoses. 
 Now, I'm not the police, obviously, but... 
 You know? 
 It sounds to me like someone got to Marjorie first. 
 Nasty women really pull the wool over your eyes. 
 That's really easy to say in hindsight. 
 Oh, yeah, because cops never pick or choose evidence to build a case. 
 You know, this has worked out really well for you. 
 Alison and Marjorie are dead, and you... 
 I, what, Sarah? 
 Now it's time for me to be blunt. 
 You're an idiot. 
 Not your hypothesis. 
 [CHUCKLES] Oh, no. 
 You're dead on. 
 You're an idiot for getting in this car. 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
 Take your cell phone... 
 And drop it out the window. 
 [CRICKETS CHIRPING] 
 [INHALES] 
 Do it. 
 Now! 
 [CELL PHONE HITTING THE GROUND] 
 That's a good girl. 
 [WHISTLING] 
 Sarah : Where are you taking me? 
 [CONTINUES WHISTLING] 
 What if someone saw me get into your car? 
 I gave you a ride home. 
 I dropped you off, I saw you walk in, close the door, lock it. 
 I had no idea The Executioner was inside waiting for you. 
 You know the punishment for lust is being smothered in fire and brimstone? 
 But what's the punishment... 
 For pride? 
 Come on now, Sarah. 
 It's not like you to get tongue tied. 
 What's the punishment? 
 Being broken on the wheel. 
 On the wheel, yeah. 
 Coming back to the town your parents were murdered in, moving into the same house, trying to outsmart the police, going toe to toe with a killer... 
 That sounds like pride to me, Sarah. 
 No. 
 No, it's not Executioner's M.O. 
 Well, I really don't give a sh1t. 
 I'm the Chief Investigator. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Cam will... 
 Cam will nothing. 
 Cam's my bitch. 
 [CAR BELL DINGING] 
 [WHISTLING] 
 Come on. 
 Sarah : No! 
 Shut up! Shut up! 
 No! 
 God! 
 Shut up! Shut up! 
 [SCREAMING] 
 Or I will punch every tooth out of your mouth. 
 No! 
 [SCREAMING] No! 
 No! Help! 
 [WHIMPERING] 
 [GROANS] 
 [CRACKING NOISE] [SCREAMING] 
 I was not... a murderer, Sarah! 
 No! No! 
 Not until you made me one! 
 Help! Help! 
 Shu... shut up! 
 Help! 
 Shut up. 
 No! 
 No! 
 Shut up! Shut up. 
 [VAUGHN SCREAMING] 
 [GUNSHOT] 
 Sarah! 
 Vaughn : There's nowhere to run, Sarah! 
 [GUNSHOT] 
 You hear me? 
 You're not gonna get away! 
 [GUNSHOT] 
 Sarah! [GUNSHOT] 
 Sarah! 
 Stop! Stop! Please! Please! 
 Stop! Help me! Stop! Please! 
 Stop! Stop! 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Help me, please! He's trying to kill me! 
 [GUNSHOT] 
 [SCREAMING] 
 [GUNSHOT] 
 Woman : Get in! Hurry! 
 Who is he? 
 [GUNSHOT] 
 Come on! 
 [YELLING] f*ck! 
 [HEART RATE MONITOR BEEPING] 
 She said that... You made him kill her. 
 [COUGHS] He said... 
 He wasn't a murderer until I turned him into someone. 
 Or something... I don't know. Just... 
 No, Sarah. 
 That... that might actually be a good thing. 
 It might mean that... That Ariel isn't dead. 
 Maybe he didn't kill her when he snatched her up. 
 He will now. 
 He was... he's desperate. 
 [HEART RATE MONITOR BEEPING] 
 [HOSPITAL P.A. CHATTER] 
 Sarah, I need to go. 
 No. [CHUCKLES] 
 Look, I have cops all over this hospital. 
 Cam. [SNIFFLES] 
 Please. Please don't leave me. 
 Okay. 
 I promise you. 
 That b*st*rd will never get within five feet of you again. 
 Do you hear me? 
 [SOBBING] 
 Ariel, wake up. 
 What? Why? What time is it? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Jake. 
 Ariel : Please let us go. 
 No! 
 Iain, please, just let us go! 
 Iain! 
 Just let us go, and we won't tell anyone! 
 We'll never tell anyone! 
 Please, Iain! 
 They already know! 
 [PANTING] 
 The punishment for lust... 
 Is fire and brimstone. 
 It's fire and brimstone, and being burned alive! 
 What are you talking about? 
 Ariel, I've sinned. 
 I've sinned... 
 I have to pay for what I've done! 
 Ariel : No! 
 Please, Iain! Iain, Iain, Iain! 
 Iain, listen! 
 Listen, I can die, okay? I'm ready. We can die together. 
 But Jake's just a little kid! He's just a little kid! 
 Please! Iain! 
 [SOBBING] 
 [SCREAMS] 
 Iain! 
 It's Cam! 
 We need to talk. 
 Open up! 
 [DOOR UNLOCKING] 
 Cam! 
 Is everything okay? Did something happen? 
 Nancy, you need to tell us where your husband is. 
 Now! 
 I... I don't like your tone, Cameron. 
 You don't like my tone? 
 Nancy... 
 You don't like my tone, then answer my goddamn question! 
 Where's your husband? 
 Cam! 
 Nancy. 
 Hi Nancy, I'm Sarah. 
 Sorry, everyone's just a little bit on edge. 
 We need your help, okay? 
 There's... There's a girl in danger. 
 Because of Iain? That's ridiculous. 
 I'm sorry, Iain's not like that. 
 No, no, no. Of course not. 
 In fact, we think he might be protecting her, we just... 
 Just need to know where they are. 
 Iain's business is his own business. 
 Yeah, no, I know but... 
 This is so important, Nancy. 
 Do you ever watch those home shows on TV? 
 You know, the ones where the wives get to design their new house, and their husbands... 
 Well, the husbands get something called a... 
 A man cave. 
 Isn't that a hoot? A man cave? 
 [SNICKERS] 
 You know, a place where... 
 Boys can be boys, no girls allowed. 
 Yeah, yeah. Well... 
 Does Iain... have a man cave? 
 Yes. 
 But I don't go there because I'm not allowed. 
 We just want to help him, Nancy. 
 Vaughn? 
 It's Cam. Come on out. 
 We've got you surrounded. 
 [PANTING] 
 Cam : Ariel? 
 [ENGINE RUNNING] 
 [SOBBING] 
 You can let go, Ariel. 
 Paramedic : Your son will be okay. 
 I'm just going to examine him. 
 He's safe now. 
 [ENGINE RUNNING] 
 [SIGHS] 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 Ariel? 
 Heather : You... 
 Mom. 
 [SOBBING] 
 I love you! 
 [CONTINUED SOBBING] 
 Mom! Mom! Mom! 
 [WIND RUSTLING] 
 Tom : Sarah. 
 Hey. 
 [GROANS] 
 Take it easy. Take it easy! 
 Did they call you? 
 Sarah : No. 
 I came myself. 
 [TOM SIGHS] 
 Sarah : How you feeling? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 How am I feeling? 
 [INHALES DEEPLY] 
 You came to see me. 
 Yeah. 
 Had a lot of time to think. 
 Put things into perspective and... 
 What? 
 I don't have enough family left to pick and choose. So... 
 Sarah : If we're gonna do this... 
 There's gonna be some ground rules. 
 Anything. 
 No more lies. 
 No more lies. 
 I promise. 
 What do you want to know? 
 I want to know why you killed my... 
 My mother and her husband. 
 I want you to tell me the truth. 
 I want you to tell me everything. 
 Every detail. 
 From the beginning. 
 [INHALES DEEPLY] 
 [ENGINE RUNNING] 
 [PANTING] 
 [GROANS]

 [GROANS] 
 [METAL DOOR CLOSING] 
 No. 
 [INAUDIBLE] 
 Help! Help! 
 Help me! 
 Somebody, help me! 
 Help me! 
 Someone, help me! 
 [SCREAMING] 
 Vaughn : Help me! 
 Help me! 
 Somebody... help me! 
 [SCREAMING] 
 [CONTINUED SCREAMING] 
 Help me!
