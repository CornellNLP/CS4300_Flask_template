 Announcer : Previously on Slasher. 
 So I spoke to Tom Winston, and he said he'd do it. 
 For a lock of my hair. 
 But if you revere the truth, you'll do this for me. 
 You're gonna have dinner with me. 
 Me and Lisa-Ann Follows. 
 The Lisa-Ann Follows? 
 You got a face for TV. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Hey! 
 [Groans] 
 [Screaming, groaning] 
 Oh, God! Ah! 
 Is there anything in Trent's past, something he might have done? 
 June : Trent never  imagined that... 
 Vaughn : What? 
 Vaughn : Ariel wouldn't make it? Have you seen her? My daughter? sh1t! What? Sarah : June was  with Trent that night. What the hell's going on, Chief? June. Her life is in danger, so I'm bringing her in. I want every available officer to search downtown. You find June Henry, and you bring her back here right away. [Gasps, struggles] You're saying it's not fine. I know, but... You know what my thing is. [Laughs] I know what you think. Debbie, you know, as long as you're happy with your camera, it's all good, but then I get to take you home, so you make me happy, so, Mm. Yeah. [Laughs] Oh, listen to me again. You done with the pics? Well, I just... I wanna get a new lens. 'Cause this one, it's not... I wanna take you home. I know. Just, look, I don't know... I know, it... As long as I, you know- Shh, shh, shh. Oh, I thought you already had a picture or 20 of a ruffed grouse. Well, this isn't a ruffed grouse, Debbie, this is a sharp-tailed grouse. And there's a difference? [Chuckles] The tail. Sharp-tailed? I don't know why I ever bought that book on birds for you. You never read it. Is this one in your bird book? [Laughs] Huh? Come on. Come on. Look, I... I read your... lovely... [Kisses] [Chuckles] bird book, you know, but I can't remember every single name. You have to, though. If you love me, you'll remember every bird in the world. [Growls playfully] [Dog barks] Where's Milo? Oh. Where's the dog? Milo! [Sighs] Oh, let's just go get him before some farmer shoots the little bugger. Fine. He does this all the time. Then I get to take you home. Then you get to take me home. Milo, where are you? Hey. There he is. Milo! Come here! Now! Jesus! What did he get into this time? [Gasps] Oh, God. What is...? [Screams] [Rodent squeaking] Yeah, yeah. I'm doing okay. Woman : I don't know... Should we go say hi? I don't know. He seems... He seems pretty overwhelmed. Yeah. I can't even imagine. Hey, Dylan. Dylan : Hey. Hi. How are you? Good. Sarah. Hi. Thank you for coming. Of course. Quite a turn out, huh? Dylan : Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. We're confident we'll find him. How's Cam? He's hanging in there. You know, he's worried, obviously. Then, again, we're all worried. Believe you me, the big man upstairs has heard an earful from this guy. I, um... Honey, could you go get us some coffee? Yeah. Thanks. Listen, about last night... Yeah. Cam was upset. And scared. He... he didn't mean a word of it. Are you sure? Mm-hm. I move back to town, and everyone starts dying? Sarah, no one blames you for that. You're one of Cam's oldest friends and right now, he needs you. Hey. Thanks for coming. Man : So sorry... Woman : Nice to see you. [Chatter] Excuse me. Cam, can I talk to you outside? Why? Just come with me. All right? Come with me, please. Come on. [Door closes] No! [Sobs] [Waves gently crashing] [Bird squawks] June was lying out, exposed to the elements, but the cause of death was most likely respiratory failure. Respiratory failure? The IV, it administered a paralytic. June's tox screens will identify which one. Did she suffer? Uh, death wasn't instantaneous. [Sighs] I wanna see her. I have to warn you, uh, June suffered a variety of wounds. Insect stings, animal bites. Cam... Son, please. Why don't you let me do this? I wanna see what he did to her. [Sniffs] CAM: It's her. That's my June. Okay, son, why don't we... Just shut up. Cam... Would you just shut up? Alan. Alan. Why don't we wait for him outside? [Cam panting] Lisa-Ann : A picture-postcard  small town. A series of bloody murders. One more gruesome than the next. Is this the latest No, this is reality  for the citizens of Waterbury. I'm coming to you live  on location  with two journalists  who are living this nightmare. Dylan Bennett, the fearless  editor-in-chief  of the  Waterbury Bulletin  and its publisher,  Alison Sutherland. Thank you for welcoming me to your town. Thank you for having us. Now, this latest victim, June Henry, she was the wife of a police deputy? Yes, and she was having an affair with our fourth victim, Trent McBride. Lisa-Ann : Is the husband a suspect? No. Why not? You see, Lisa-Ann, these were not crimes of passion. All the victims have a deep, dark secret in their past. And these secrets are based on one of the deadly sins, am I right? Yes. That is the working theory. Well, then, would you say that this killer is a vigilante? Cleaning up your town? Uh, um-hm... You see, I'm a big believer in justice. I'm a journalist. Our job is to expose the truth. I don't agree that anybody can... [Sighs] Dylan : but these are  also, in fact...  crimes... He's a natural. Dylan : and whether or not... Yeah. Dylan : the victims  deserved the punishment... He sure is. Society can't function. Imagine a scenario where every crime that's committed against me, for example, I go out, and I commit an equally or... or... or worse, in fact, crime. Dylan : And whether or not  the victims deserved it... You know what? I'm gonna get some air. Need some air? Dylan : criminal acts  are given...  a carte blanche... Yeah. Excuse me. Dylan : on occasion... Sure. Dylan : the criminal justice  system may or may not  get it right. [Door buzzes open] [Fastening handcuffs] [Door shuts] Is there any news? Did they reply? "Hey, Alan, how was your day? What's that? You spent it consoling your son after his wife was found in a field half-eaten by wild animals and a Shepherd mix? Well, that's shitty." Okay! It's wonderful to see you again, Alan. Better? [Chains rattling] This doesn't change anything. [Strikes table] I'd like to go back to my cell now. [Door buzzes open] [Chains rattling] [Sighs] Okay, you're... Sorry... Your standing this close to me, it's actually making me hotter. Your makeup's running into your eyes. I know. I can... I can feel them stinging. Thank you. [Clears throat] Are you okay? Never been better. You can talk, you know, when she asks us questions. Oh, I would, but you're kinda sucking all the oxygen out of the room. Dylan, you are doing great. The camera adores you. Just keep doing what you're doing. Okay, thanks. [Sighs] What, we're back in five. You wanna do something? Your job, maybe? [Sighs] Alan was working the room like he was running for office. It was bizarre. Okay, so... Alan finds out that June and Trent are cuckolding his son, and he kills them. Maybe, but... you know, they were both guilty of sloth, so... Unless Alan's using the seven deadly sins as a cover, but... then why would he kill my grandmother and Justin? Yeah, right, why would a Christian zealot wanna kill a gay Muslim? And Verna McBride? I mean... Oh, I wanted to kill Verna McBride. Many times. No, wait. Alan lives with Cam. The police went through that house top to bottom. They would've found something. What about Alan's other house? Need a ride? [Door closes] No. I'm fine. I'll see you tomorrow. [Crickets chirping] What if... What if Alan catches us here? I don't know... We... tell him we're praying for loved ones or... lighting a candle. Whatever it is people do here. Stop worrying. Me? Stop worrying? I had an ulcer by the time I was 10 years old. Go, go, go. Go, go, go. What are you doing? Robin : Sarah, I don't think anything's in here. I think we should go. Robin, please. Just... just look. We're wasting our time. [Drawer squeaks] [Sighs] [Drawer squeaks] Sorry. Robin? What? What is that? I think it's the murder kit. [Phone chimes] [Birds chirping] I... I kept telling June we should... you know, get one of those, cup things, but... she said they were bad for the environment, so... You're stuck with my swamp mud. You're not here for the coffee. How well does your dad know Tom Winston? Why? He's his religious counselor. Why don't you get to your point, Sarah? What if Tom's behind the killings? He's orchestrating them from behind bars? Having someone... carry them out? [Birds chirping] Found a... A murder kit in your dad's office. Had... rope and handcuffs and weapons. Hm. Just, I know this is the last thing you wanna hear, but, you know, just... take a step back, okay? Everyone's a suspect. Yeah. Yeah, they are. Including you, Sarah. Come on. Your parents are murdered by a religious zealot. You move back to town, into the exact same house, and the killings start all over again? Day after you return? Or, hey... Maybe Dylan's the killer. Hm? I mean, why would a big city journalist move back to this podunk backwater? And don't say so he could be the editor of that bullshit rag. Huh? He's back here and suddenly the killings start all over again and... [Slams hand] Why, he's sitting on the biggest news story in the country. All right, well, maybe you're the killer, Cam. Your wife was cheating on you, so you kill her and her lover, horribly, brutally. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it's me. Your dad is hiding something. Yeah. Dylan is too. I'll bet my life on it. Hello, hello. [Phone ringing] Hey, there. A little jolt of caffeine to start your morning. Voila. My morning started three hours ago. Okay. I may have taken a couple of acting classes in university. I'm pretty comfortable in front of the camera. What, are you saying I'm not? Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Finally, some truth out of you. I wasn't un... uncomfortable. I- I-I bombed. Yeah. Yeah. Big, big huge bomb. Listen, I can help you out. Okay? I can give you some pointers if you want. We can... What? Why would you do that? Because we're partners. We work together. Oh, right. Okay... Dylan : A little newspaper called  The Bulletin . You get to be charming and telegenic and famous while I... do all the grunt work and dig up the actual news. That's... that's... that's fair. Why? Did you find something? Thanks for the latte. Alison? I'm sure you've got a ton of fan mail to get to. Okay, listen. I just did my job last night. Okay? And I'm trying to do my job right now. You're the one who crashed and burned, not me. So... as the editor-in-chief, if you found something, I need to know. Go ahead. Tell me you are not trying to hack into June's text messages. Uh, I am trying to, and I am failing. Good. Good. I'm glad you're failing, because it's unethical, and it's very illegal. Okay, if you have a problem with it, then... Then you cover the jazz cruise. I hear the boat departs from the Main Street marina  at noon. They could shut us down. They could... They could throw us in jail. Yeah, and we could also find all those sweet nothings that June and Trent blasted to each other across the ether. No, no, no, no. Imagine what Lisa-Ann would give for a little s*x to go with all those blood and guts. The woman would crucify us. I have never named a source. I'm not about to start now. You've tried all the obvious passwords? Hello, Sarah. Taken far too long to drop by and check out your gallery. Wow. You've really transformed the place. Thank you. So. An old woman goes to confession and she says to her priest, "Father, I've spoken ill of my neighbor, and I seek forgiveness." "Go find a chicken," he says. "And pluck out all the feathers and drop them around town. That is your penance." She does as she's told. But she doesn't feel any better so she goes back to the priest. And he says, "Now go around and retrieve all the feathers." And she says, "Father, how can I? They've been scattered to the winds." And the priest smiles... and he says, "Just like your words. What you throw out can never be taken back." Can I help you with something? Yeah, you can start by not upsetting my son. I could go to Chief Vaughn with what you've done. Then, why don't you? You're jumping to conclusions here. Am I? And you should be careful. I will. Now, thanks for stopping by. You know, your parents, they were quite naïve. They thought they were invincible. I would hate to see history repeat itself. This one has to be my favorite. "I want all of it, Trent. I want the fights and the makeups. I want the kisses good night and the waking up the next morning in your strong arms. I wanna walk along the beach with you at Catherine Cove, the sand between our toes just you and me, [Laughs] and the sunset. I wanna kiss you and call you 'baby'. That's what I want, Trent. With you." She sounds like an oxygen deprived teenager. How... did you get these? They are gold. Uh, they were e-mailed to us. We can't reveal our source, obviously. Yeah. Was it June's husband? [Chuckles] Or one of Trent's ex-girlfriends? We could bring her on the show, add a little "zhuzh". Like I said, we can't reveal our source. You understand. All right, well, tonight, our focus is s*x, s*x, s*x. Are you okay with that, Dylan? Dylan : Yeah, um, that is the story. Uh, right? Alison, you want to...? Of course, of course. I mean, if we can... publish it, we can talk about it. Actually, it might be better if we just focus on one of you. I mean, it's easier for our audience. You know, keeps their attention. You understand what I'm saying. Yeah, I mean, but Alison is the face of  The Bulletin . Yeah, but  The Bulletin  will still get a prominent display in the chyron. Well, it's, um, it's your show. So if that's what you think is best, then... Great. I knew you'd understand. Yeah, but wait. Um, the texts are salacious, absolutely, but I, you know, I feel like it's really a love story between a man and a woman. Now, I can give the male perspective, and I think Alison would be great giving the, uh, female... point of view. Well, let me think on it. I hear what you're saying. Great work today. See you tonight. It'll be fine. 
 
 Hey, hon. Those texts were personal, not news. Sarah, I... Did you think about Cam? Did you think about what it'll be like for him when the whole town reads this crap? Listen, I report the news, good or bad. You know that. I do now. "Making love to Cam is like  going for a bad massage. A lot of touching,  a lot of squeezing,  and you end up feeling sore  and kind of embarrassed." Ouch. And you're telling me Cam Henry is not a suspect? Cam Henry is a respected member of the Waterbury Police Department. John Wayne Gacy dressed up as a clown and performed at children's birthday parties. Means  nada . Does this look bad for Sergeant Henry? Absolutely. But we have to remember, Lisa-Ann, these murders are motivated by the seven deadly sins, and last time I checked, screwing around on your husband is not one of them. Lust is. Yep, but given how Trent  McBride and June Henry  were murdered, coupled with the fact that they shirked off  their responsibility  in protecting Ariel Peterson... Lisa-Ann : Lust, sloth, Kill two birds with one stone. Except... he enjoys killing people. No, really? He does? Knock me out with a feather. I think what Alison's trying  to say is that... The Executioner's not concerned  with being economical.. With his killings. Lisa-Ann : Well, that brings up What does this killer want? Why is he doing this? Dylan : Well, I feel like  the religious nature  of these crimes  can't be ignored. "My God is a vengeful God." Lisa-Ann : Jesus also says, In the New Testament. But I feel like this killer... Lisa-Ann : Very good point, there are two sides Why don't we ask The Executioner himself? Serial killers... write to newspapers all the time. Uh, The Son of Sam, BTK, The Zodiac. If The Executioner has a message, then please talk to me. Let me interview you. One on one. We'll be right back to talk more about the religious aspects of these terrible crimes. [Show outro music plays] Man : And we're clear, everybody. Alison, this guy's not done killing. He has three more to go: pride, lust, greed, and call me crazy, but throwing yourself to the lions does seem a little prideful. Are you concerned, or are you just jealous that you didn't think of it first? Jealous? He's a cold-blooded killer. He is. And, uh, that'll make for an incredible interview, won't it? [Sighs] [Crickets chirping] [Dog growls] Distorted voice : Alison. Alison. [Gasps] Distorted voice : Open it. [Birds chirping] They're stored in Evidence. I understand. I'm not asking for the originals, just some copies. Why? So you can watch dear old Mom screw a bunch of strangers? I gave those tapes to you in good faith. I found them in my house. My hands are tied. You know, you're not the boss of this town, Chief Vaughn. And you're not Nancy Drew. You're a failed artist who's stuck in a small town who can't even sell other people's art work. That's who you are, Sarah. [Office chatter] [Sighs] [Camera beeps] [Sighs] [Sharp noise] [Flapping wings] [Wind picking up] [Camera beeping] [Sighs] [Sniffs] [Metal door clangs] [Heavy muffled breathing] How do I know you're... You're really him? [Wind howls] This could be a really sick joke. June Henry's toxicology report will show curare in her system. It's a paralytic... and it... left her... defenseless. Would you like to... confirm this before we proceed? I'll take your word for it. Executioner : We all sin. Every day of our lives, we sin. Taking the Lord's name in vain. That's a sin everyone commits. However, I only kill those who deserve to die. Even if God himself commanded, "Thou shalt not kill"? Thou shalt not kill the innocent. My victims... were not innocent. Does that strike a bell with you, Alison? Of course it does. You're killing people. You've made yourself judge and jury. I... am but a reaction to their sins. In fact, you and I have much in common. I'm sure... I'd s... I'm not sure I'd agree with that. You're a newsmaker. Hm? Does it not perform the duties of... judge and jury in its own way? We report the truth, the facts. And nothing but the facts. Yes. [Heavy breathing] So help you God... [Chuckles] [Heavy breathing] Thank you for the interview. You have no sins, Alison? Nothing that weighs heavily on your conscience? No, nothing. [Heavy breathing] [Door clangs] [Gasps, exhales in relief] Verna McBride put up  quite a fight. Trust me, I was far more fair with her  than she was with her husband. Alison : Why did you cut off  her hands and feet? The plan was to chop her up into seven pieces. I thought it would be poetic. But I was interrupted. Holy sh1t. Okay, let's... let's pump the brakes here. Can we confirm that that's him? That could be anybody in the mask. You heard what he told me. Stuff only The Executioner would know. Alison, you must have been terrified. [Laughs] Well... when he stood up at the end, I'll admit, my bladder and brain had a momentary disconnect. Well, our techies should be able to clear up picture and sound, but... I kinda like the verité quality. And I wanna build an entire special around it. Really? Oh. Okay. Wow. I am putting you on a plane to New York tomorrow. We'll do it in our studio, we'll bring in some big names. Are there any journalists or crime writers that you are particularly fond of? Uh, oh, God. Okay, uh, lemme think. Um, Or Dylan? Anybody you can... We'll... we'll pipe Dylan in from here if we need him. Someone's gotta hold down the fort, right? Hey, guys, what about, uh, going to the police? You know? I mean, this is a pretty major break in the case. It is. And they can watch it on TV tomorrow night. Like the rest of the world. When we land, I'm gonna whisk you to my stylist. They're gonna do hair, makeup, wardrobe. Which you get to keep, so aim high. Sarah. Pleasure to meet you, at last. Come in. Sit down. I'm sorry I didn't make it to your grandmother's memorial. She and I go way back. And this mess, well, it's just a mess, isn't it? Mr. Mayor... And our tourism industry is on life support. I mean, this is way worse than a rainy summer. How about I just ask you what I came here to ask you? Ah, big city girl, straight to the point. Gotta love it. Shoot. [Sighs] The police found some VHS tapes in my house, and they admitted them into evidence. I'd like some copies. Have you spoken to Chief Vaughn? I have. Well, if he says no, it's a police matter. It's out of my jurisdiction. I'm sorry. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to... How 'bout this for straight to the point? You lean on Vaughn and get me copies of those tapes ASAP or I tell my husband the reporter about your affair with my grandmother. I am sure Lisa-Ann Follows would love to talk about the sordid love life of one of The Executioner's victims and the mayor? Grandpa. [Phone ringing] [Door opening] Okay, order whatever you want. Or just not the champagne. Not from this joint. I'll have another double. No ice. So... I just watched a rough cut of your interview... Excuse me. And, ugh, my dear, for the first time in my life, I was speechless. Ah! Awesome. That is great. [Sighs] Unbelievable. [Laughs] Okay. So, um... Okay, here's something I've been wanting to ask. Uh-huh. How do I translate all of this into something bigger? Bigger? Well, this story's burning bright for now, but it won't last forever. Hell, we're almost out of sins. Okay. So what exactly does bigger look like? Look, I was born in Waterbury, I spent most of my life here. God, I rent the apartment above  The Bulletin  because I've sunk all my life savings just to keep it on life support. I refuse to die here. Not with this albatross of a newspaper wrapped around my neck. Girl to girl? No bullshit? Yeah, of course. Okay. What you did, with The Executioner, balls to the wall. But he is a pussycat. People like me, we have no moral code. You can't, not in this business. And, honey, underneath all of the bluster, you're actually kind of nice. That's not a bad thing. It's a good thing, really. Mm-hm. You remember that  News of the World  scandal over in the UK, where they hacked into the phone of that murdered girl's parents? Of course. What about it? Well... let's just say they could have learned a thing or two from me. 'Cause I was never caught. Ariel Peterson's disappearance  was big news,  or at least for a little while, but with no new leads, the story started  to die a slow death. So... I made sure it stayed live. Benny Peterson was Everyone knew it. He threatened if Heather ever left him. All the facts pointed to him, but there was no So I provided one. Did the trick. The readership shot up. Made enough money to keep  The Bulletin  afloat for another year. Vaughn focused the entire investigation on Benny Peterson, built a compelling case against him. And then... Benny hung himself. Everyone assumed the case was solved. Benny killed his daughter, then he hung himself out of guilt, but... Heather... never bought it, and I, um... Lisa-Ann : What? [Sighs] Well, what if I was wrong? What if Benny was innocent? What if Ariel's still out there, and whoever took her... got away with it because of me? Lisa-Ann : What if? What if he was guilty, and you nudged justice along? [Rock music playing] Tell me, if you could go back, if you could do things differently, would you? [Sighs] Pity won't keep the lights on, or my staff being paid. Get this lady a drink. Pronto! [Sighs] Sarah, my nose is really itchy. Don't move. [Groans] It's like I have poison ivy and... crabs duking it out in my left nostril. Can I just...? No. [Sighs] If you don't stop moving, I'm gonna make you look like a Picasso. [Groans] I can't. Sorry. Robin... Robin : What is he doing? Sarah, come see this. [Engine starts] Robin : Where the hell's he going? [Door opening] Sarah, my spidey-senses are tingling and telling me that we should not be doing this. Wanna just stay in the car? It's okay, you know. You don't have to be brave for me. I know, but I need to be brave for Justin. Okay? Okay. Let's do this. Okay. [Door opening] [Door closing] Which way did he go? Woman : No! [Indistinct shouting] This way... Woman : Alan, please! You're scaring me! Alan : Just do what I say! Do it now! Slow... slow down. Woman : I can't! Alan! It's too much! Alan : Do it! [Groans] Father, forgive me! For I have sinned! [Groans] [Pants] Holy sh1t! [Birds chirping] [Chuckles] Sure. Oh, hold on. The limo's here. Yeah, no. It's not a secret. I've told everyone I'm going. [Chuckles] Hold on. Wait. Where's the guy? Okay. Hello? Jesus. I don't know what's happening. Um, if... if people can't watch the special live, I want those PVRs set, okay? Make sure. I've only been to New York once before, if you can believe it. Yep. Years ago. I'm sure it's changed a lot since then. [Car door closes] Executioner : Hello, Alison. Alison : No! No! No! No! [Gasps, screams] [Heavy breathing] [Gasps, shuddering breaths] No. Please don't do this. No. No! [Whimpers] You asked me the other day... if I had sinned. [Gasps] I... I lied to you. I have sinned. I am a sinner. I did something awful, and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, God. I'm sorry. [Pants] But... But I repent. I repent. I swear, I'll make up for it. I will. I'll do anything. Please, don't, just... Please let me go. Please! No! No! Let me...! You can't do this! No! No! [Screams] [Doorbell rings] Good morning, Mrs. Bennett. Uh, hey, Officer Sharma. Chief Vaughn wanted me to deliver these. I guess courier's part of my job description now. Thanks! [Panting, sexual moans] [Disco music] [Moaning] [Hard rock guitar] [Panting, sexual moans] Oh, my God. Is... Is that Tom? So, me and the boys, pooling our money together, gonna spend all next year down in the Caribbean. I got a lead on a 34-foot monohull. [Whistles] Figure, you know, start in Miami, head south from there. Cuba, Monserrat, Hispaniola, Santa Lucia, baby. Come on, it's gonna be sick. Yo, Bo, a side of mayo and some garlic powder,  por favor . Poor man's garlic aioli! What? What? The hell's this? Calamari? Whoa! Whatever's jammed down there is a whole lot bigger than an ear. Man : Is it Alison? No comment. The limo company said she never got in their car. She never got on her plane, she never checked into her hotel room in New York. I said, "No comment." The biblical punishment for greed is burning in a vat of hot oil. This has The Executioner written all over it. Are you happy about this? Is that was this is, huh? She was your boss. You knew her! So you are confirming that it was Alison Sutherland? You're a real piece of sh1t. You know that? Maybe. But this is my story, Vaughn. Now, you could work with me, and we can inform the public together, or I could do this on my own, my own way. You choose. I have the ear and the trust of this town, of this country. Don't think I could say the same for you, Vaughn! [Humming] Oh, there you are. Can I go make you a nice sandwich? I picked up some pastrami. No. You sure? You must be starving. I'm fine.
