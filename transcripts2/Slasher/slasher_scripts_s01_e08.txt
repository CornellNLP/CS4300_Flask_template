Welcome home. You glow. Well, maybe you're the killer, Cam He thinks this is over. It's not even close to being over. (INAUDIBLE) This town has been cleansed. "And the Lord said in His heart, 'Never again will I curse the ground for man's sake,  nor will I again destroy every living thing as I have done'." (HEAVY BREATHING) (HEAVY BREATHING CONTINUES) (GASPS) Jesus! My God, Cam. What is wrong with you? Wake up, Cam. Wake up! Suzy, would you... sh1t, Alan! Calm down. Where am I? You're sleepwalking. And you wanna know why? Because you were playing goddamn videogames right before bed again. And I told you not to. If you would just frickin' listen to me, we wouldn't have to go through this every frickin' night. Oh, come on. You pissed yourself? You are too old for this. What is wrong with you? I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't mean to. Well, you did, Cam. You did. And now I'm gonna have to change all your sheets and wash them, and your pj's, too. And I'm gonna be lucky if I get two hours of goddamn sleep because you are such a little baby! (SIGHS) Suzy : I oughta, uh, make you wear diapers. Would you like that? How would you like that? Wearing diapers to bed. That's what I oughta do. I'm gonna make you wear diapers to bed. And to school, in front of all your friends. To teach you a lesson because you are such a little baby! (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (SNAP) Alan : What the hell? Cam? Suzanne! Suzanne! What happened? Jesus, no. Suzanne. No! What have you done? No! Cameron! No! No! Oh, come on. It's smiling. It's wrong. No, it's not. It... Look at it. Yeah, okay. Yeah, it's a smile. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. A ridiculous smile. (LAUGHS) Well, it's not very scary. (BOTH LAUGHING) I bet you never thought this was possible. Havin' fun... in Waterbury? Yeah, I guess I didn't. (SNICKERS) (TAPS TABLE) Sarah. I know we both lost people we love, this summer. (BIRDS CHIRPING) But... Waterbury... It had a problem. (SCOFFS) Lots of problems, lots of secrets... (BIRDS CHIRPING) and, um... What? The Executioner... He kinda cleaned up this town. In his own sick way. I mean, yeah, but... murdering eight people? Yeah, I'm not condoning... his actions. I'm just saying that... (SIGHS) I don't, I don't know what I'm saying. Forget it. Sorry. Yeah. What you're saying... I think you're right. There's a lot of darkness in this town and it's not just The Executioner You two be helping me hand out candy tomorrow or...? (SIGHS) I don't know how many trick or treaters we'll get. It's, uh... it's Sarah's birthday, tomorrow. Oh, right. Right. Happy Birthday. Thank you. All right, so, you know, I should... go back to work. Remember, scary, okay? Chase those demons away. (DOOR OPENING) She seems in fine spirits. Yeah. She is. (SIGHS) "When the storm passes by, the wicked are gone." Proverbs 10:25. See? I did pay attention in Sunday school. (SNIFFS AND CLEARS THROAT) Now, that, I like for the house. Mm-hm. In the backyard. We'll take anything you've pain Money's no object. Woman : Really? Since when? Elise, I make six figures drinking blood on the net. Yeah, I know you do. I wish you didn't. Why? It's not cheating. Maybe not to you, it isn't. You know what, I'm just gonna leave you, um... (CUSTOMER CHATTER) I haven't seen this much black nail polish since I worked the make up count in the '90s. I know. Can you believe this? And what is this, exactly? Happy Halloween? Huh? Speaking of... I wasn't gonna throw one this year, but... You're doing it for Justin? Yeah. Yeah. Halloween was like, uh, Christmas, and id, and a drag show all rolled into one for him. So, it felt sort of wrong, not celebrating it. You know... (SIGHS) Anywho, uh... Seeing as how I forgot my garlic and holy water, I... should make like Dracula and fly. But I will see you at The Eh Frame tomorrow night. Hmm. Yes. Sarah? No, you know, I just want to stay in bed and eat my weight in candy. Babe, it's your birthday. Exactly. I'm not giving up on you. You will be doing the Monster Ma with me tomorrow night. Yeah, you know what? Just dream big. (ROBIN LAUGHS MANIACALLY) (PANTING) Alan : Looking in fine form, son. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Whatta ya want? Talk for a minute? I can't even imagine... how upset you still must be. About June? That was three months ago, Dad. It took me years to get over the death of your mother, Cam. Well... Mourning won't bring June back. Didn't bring back Mom. That's true. But... What? You and Sarah... I'm worried you might be rushing into something... unseemly. (EXHALES DEEPLY) (DROPS DUMBBELLS) Really? Tell me something, Dad. Are you this righteous when you' down on your hands and knees being whipped and flogged with a dog collar around that perverted little neck of yours? Hmm? (GROANS) (GROANING) Hey... You know, I'm... I'm headed downtown. I could... I could give you a ride to the church, if you want. No, I'm fine. You go. All right. Suit yourself. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (SIGHS) (ENGINE STARTING) (SIGHS) (SIGHS) (GASPS) (CRYING) I'm sorry, there's none of my own work left. Let me guess, the "vamps" got here first. (LAUGHS) Um, I do have a website, then when more become available, you can buy them online. (DOOR CLOSING) Could you... just excuse me for a second? Dylan : Hey. What are you doing here? What am I...? I've been calling for days. You're not answering your phone. Because I don't want to talk to you. It's your birthday, babe. Yeah. Best present you can give me is just to leave me alone. Sarah, listen. I screwed up. I admit that. I don't even have the words to express how sorr... (LAUGHING) You don't have the words. Listen, babe. You wanted me... to remove myself from the story. I did that. You wanted me to cut ties with Lisa-Ann? I did that, too. All I am now is the editor of a simple small town paper, and I'm fine with that. (PHONE BEEPING) (SIGHS) Sarah, you are the single most important thing to me in the world. And you only came to that conclusion after everything had gone to hell? That's not true. It's too little, too late. Now, please. I'd like you to leave. Sarah. (CUSTOMER CHATTER) (SIGHS) (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) Come, Cameron. (SNIFFS) Come and pray with me. (EXHALES DEEPLY) (SOFTLY CRYING) "Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your loving kindness, according to the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly of mine iniquity, and cleanse me of my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me." (ALAN SHUDDERS) Dad? Why are you crying? (SOBBING) Dad? (CONTINUED SOBBING) I'm sorry. (SIGHS) You know, some parents... It takes time to love their children. Your mother was like that. But me... The moment I saw you, my whole life finally made sense. (SNIFFS) Cam, was I a good father? Yeah, of course. Are you sure? 'Cause I worry. I worry I didn't do everything I needed to do for you. Dad... you're... you're acting really strange. (SOBBING) I hoped you'd forget about that night. I thought it better just... just to move forward. (SIGHS) But now I don't think that was the right thing to do. (SNIFFS) (SIGHS) I'm not angry at you, son. I'm not. I'm no angel. Far from it. And those people and their sins... Who knows, a 100 years ago, maybe the state would have put 'em to death. But you broke man's law, Cam. More importantly, you broke God's law. Hmm. But I can help you with that. We can ask God, to forgive you, together. (SIGHS) And what happens after that? Hmm? I'm sorry. "Lord of grace and truth, we confess our unworthiness to stand in Your presence as Your children. (SOBBING) We have sinned. Forgive... and heal us." (CONTINUED SOBBING) (CHOKING) Cam! You know I'm terrible. I am not! (CHOKING) Goddamnit. Goddamnit. (CONTINUED CHOKING) (GROANS) (GASPING) (EXHALES DEEPLY) Goddamnit. (SOBBING) Forgive me, God. (CONTINUED SOBBING) No one else needed to die. (THUD AT THE DOOR) (BICYCLE BELL RINGING) Dylan : Tennyson wrote, "'Tis better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all." Well, guess what? Lord Tennyson had no idea what he was talking about. Waterbury has faced many losses this year. But... For me, my own personal loss has been my wife. I didn't lose her to The Executioner, however. I lost her to myself. The greatest sin, the cardinal sin... Sharma : "is pride. It's been the downfall of many a man and woman, and now it's my own personal undoing." Wow. (PHONE RINGING) God, if Sarah doesn't take him back, I will. Don't you have any actual work to do? (BIRDS CHIRPING) You know, it was romantic, and it was brave. I do appreciate the sentiment. I didn't write that... thinking you'd magically change your mind, Sarah. I wrote it so you'd hear me out. You know, what, yeah, and I want to believe you in the spirit that it was written in, but... You know you lied to me. For years. (SOFTLY) Yeah. I just... I just wish we'd never come here. You know what? I'd still be a li even if we had. I'm glad... I'm glad we came here. Because... you wanted the truth, Sarah. And... and you got it. Maybe more truth than you bargained for. (BIRDS SQUAWKING) What are you talking about? This is me, Sarah. I have nothin' left to hide. For the first time since we've met. And the irony is... we had a better shot of making it, if we met now. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (PICKING THE LOCK) (DOOR UNLOCKS) Or we could do a piece on what to do with all your Halloween crap the day after. Right? Like the Jack-o'-lantern, all the candy you don't want your kids to scarf down. Maybe recycling your costume into your bedroom. Sound fun? Whoa! Whoa! Cam : Get down on the ground! Officer : Nobody move! Get down on the ground! Cam, what's...? What...? Dylan Bennett, you are under arrest for murder. What are you talking about? There's a mistake. This is a mistake! (GROANS) Verna McBride, Justin Faysal... Cam : Brenda Merritt... You're making a mistake. Cam : Trent McBride. June Henry... You sick son of a bitch! Alison Sutherland, Iain Vaughn, and Tom Winston. Call Sarah. Tell her to meet me at the station. Thanks. No problem. Hey, Sarah. (SIGHS) I don't understand. Just take it easy. Okay? Breathe. Sharma : Chief? We're done here. Want me to take Sarah to the hotel? We have to impound their car. Uh... No. Thanks, I got it. Just, uh... We're good. Thanks, Sharma. You're gonna be okay. It's like he wanted me to find them. To punish me. Or maybe he wanted to be caught. I don't understand. Sarah... There's no telling what goes on in the mind of a... a criminal. (CRYING) I just want to close my eyes and never open them. You go ahead. I'm here. I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere. (SOBBING) We married the wrong people. I should have waited for you. And now... I can never tell if... you felt the way I did. (SIGHS) I should have been more brave. No. You are brave, Cam. You're the... You're the bravest man I know. 
 
 (BIRDS CHIRPING) Sarah, maybe... Maybe we should... No. (MOANING) (PANTING) Cam : I was thinkin'... I'll go spend a few hours with Dylan. See what... see what I can find out. And I thought, maybe afterwards... we come back here, order some food? I actually just need to be alone Huh? Well... It's been a long day. Why don't you call me if you change your mind, okay? (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) (KIDS YELLING) (DOG BARKING) Now... Why don't you tell me why we found a box full of evidence in your house? What the hell are you talking about? Do you deny that this is your box? Hmm? Or is it Sarah's? Okay. I need to talk to my lawyer. No, you need to tell me why you kept a box full of goddamn souvenirs from the murder scenes. Brenda Merritt's fingernails. Tell me, Dylan, did you... You pull those out with pliers? No! Cam, listen to me. I didn't do anything to anybody, Cam. You have the wrong guy. What about my wife's hair, huh? Okay, I need to see my lawyer. Now! Yeah... Maybe I'll do that... tomorrow. You better get used to that chair because you're gonna be there all night. Cam, listen to me. Cam! Plea... Hear me out! (CLICKED ON TABLET) (TRICK OR TREATER CHATTER) Yeah. Cam? He framed me? He's trying to. We've got hard evidence. No. Sarah, we have a painting. We have a theory. We don't have near enough proof. Well, then, I'll find the proof. No, Sarah. Find a lawyer. They'll find someone who outranks Cam, and we'll handle it that way. By the time that happens, you'll be found hanging in your cell. Hey, listen, I will find you a lawyer. No! Sarah, please. I'm not waiting, anymore. Babe, do not go... Don't leave, Sarah! It's not safe! Girl : Trick or treat! (TRICK OR TREATER CHATTER) Man : This is it, all right? Child : Okay. Girl : Trick or treat! (SLOSHING NOISE) 911 OPERATOR: 911. What is your emergency? Hello? Are you there? Hello? (HANGS UP PHONE) (MUSIC PLAYING) Merlin! Merlin! Cut! (MUSIC ENDS) (CLEARS THROAT) Uh, sorry, everyone. Uh, I didn't mean to stop the dancing. Just one second. I just wanted to thank you all.. So, so much for coming. I really appreciate it. Man : Whoo! Woman : Yeah! Um... You probably didn't know this... I didn't, but... Halloween, actually started as a celebration of life. We would, um, wear costumes... to scare off death. Well, some of us do. Some of us actually dress up like hot firemen and sexy nurses so we can get laid tonight. Right? I see you. I see you over there. Um... (CLEARS THROAT) I, uh... I lost the love of my life this year. And I've... I've felt very powerless, ever since. (SNIFFS) But tonight... (LAUGHS) Tonight I am giving... a great big middle finger to death because... (SIGHS) Because I'm still here. Man : That's right. Man 2 : You bet. Robin : We are still here. (SIGHS) So, Justin... Wherever you are, I really hope... that you can see us celebrating your favorite holiday. As we raise our glass to you... All : Justin. Happy Halloween! (HOOTS AND HOLLERING) Let's party! Merlin! (MUSIC STARTS AGAIN) Sarah : Robin? Honey, honey, honey. Robin : I've got some very disturbing news. Listen, is Cam here? I... yeah. Would you look at that? Listen, I don't believe you. Dylan can't be The Execu... Yeah, he's not, okay? But even if he is, I want you to know I'm here for you, okay? You're a victim, too. Okay. Yeah, thanks. (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) Hey! What are you doing here? I thought you were gonna lay low tonight? Well, I thought you'd be at the police station. I decided to let Dylan stew for a bit. He's... he's lying through his teeth. Denied everything. But I'm gonna break him. Do you wanna go outside? The party's in here. Exactly. Is everything okay, Sarah? Never better. Come on. Wait. Where are you taking me? What's with all the questions, huh? Aren't you supposed to be interrogating, Dylan? No, no, wait. Are you sure, you're okay with this, Sarah? You mean, go back inside? No. Then, shut up. (STABBING SOUND) (GROANING) (PANTING) What did you do to me? What did I do to you? What did I do to you?! What the hell's going on? Robin? No, no, Robin. (STABBING SOUND) (GROANING) Robin! (GROANING) (SCREAMING) No! Hey, what's going on down there? Someone call 911. What the hell? Sharma! Let me out of here! (SIGHS) (CONTINUES TO SIGH) (DOOR OPENING) Your wife called. Pardon the outfit. I assure you, I am a lawyer. Can you tell him to let me out of here? I'm sorry, I can't do anything until I can reach Chief Henry. I have brought with me a writ of habeas corpus. Do you have any idea what that means? No. It means... either you charge my client with an actual crime or you release him. You can't just keep him here. I don't... I don't have the authority to do anything. Fine. I'll make a decision for you. Mr. Bennett. Sharma : Wha...? Thank you. Wait, um... Good evening. sh1t. Help! (GROANING) (CRYING) (DROPS KEYS) 911 Operator : 911. What's your emergency? Sarah : Please, you've got to help me. The Executioner, he's here. 911 Operator : I'm sorry? Help! 911 Operator : Are you there? This is Sarah Bennett! He's outside! He's trying to kill me! 911 Operator : Are you in danger? Ma'am? Sarah : No! (SCREAMING) Open the door, Sarah. (SCREAMING) Open the goddamn door! (SCREAMING) Get out! (THUD AT DOOR) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTING) (KNIFE HITS THE GROUND) Dylan : Sarah! Dylan? Go! Get help now! No! Sarah : No! Don't! Don't! (GRUNTING) No! Don't! (CONTINUED GRUNTING) No! (GASPING) (SCREAMS) (CONTINUED SCREAMING) (SOBBING) (SARAH GROANING) This isn't what I wanted. This is the exact opposite of what I wanted! (WHIMPERING) I... I ruined this! (SOBBING) I ruin everything! (CAM YELLING) I ruin everything! (GASPING) I'm gonna rest here, okay? (SIGHS) Hey. Sarah. Did I tell you about the first t I saw you, Sarah? (SIGHS) Camp Motega. Your first day there. And you were sitting by the lake running your fingers through the water. (SIGHS) In the air... I don't know, I guess it was... I guess it was dandelion seeds or something, but... Ah, just these... white flecks... flowing... glowing in the sun. (GROANING) (GASPING) You don't think... I just... (GROANING) You know, I stopped. And I watched you. You were just so perfect. P...? Perfect? Cam : Yeah. No. You're just so... pure. (SARAH WHIMPERING) And... innocent, you know? Perfect. (GROANING) Hmm. Well... (CONTINUED WHIMPERING) (SIGHS) (GROANING) I'm sorry. (SCREAMING) (METAL CLANK) (GROAN) (SOBBING) Sarah! (CAM GROANING) (CONTINUED GROANING) Cam : What did you do? (WHIMPERING) (GASPS) Dylan : Sarah, don't! Don't, Sarah! Don't! Don't do it. Wh...? Why? (SOBBING) Oh, why? Don't. Because you're not a murderer. Sarah : No, please. No! Please, Dylan. Please, I need you to help me. No. Please... help. Please, Dylan! I need you, please. (SOBBING) (WHIMPERING) SARAH: Just... please! No! (GRUNTING) Sarah : No! No! No! No! (GASPING) I don't remember meeting you, Cam. That's not true. I remember camp. I remember becoming friends, but... I don't remember the first time I saw you! It was that day by the lake. See, that's just... It was just a Saturday. I wasn't... I wasn't innocent. I wasn't pure. I was 15! I didn't know who I was. But I do now. (SARAH CRYING) (CAM GROANING) God! I'll tell you what I'll never forget. I'll never forget seeing my grandmother... drifting in the lake. The life draining out of her. (CAM GROANING) (CAM WHIMPERING) (GRUNTING) (CONTINUED GROANING) (CONTINUED WHIMPERING) Ow! I'll never forget Justin's last breath. Cam, June worshipped the ground you walked on. (CAM GROANING) How she trusted you... (GASPING) (POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING) (YELLING) (GROANING) (GASPING) Sarah : The desecration of Verna McBride. What you did to Robin. Your father, Cam! Your father! (CAM GROANING) (POLICE SIRENS GROWING LOUDER) (KNOCKS AT THE DOOR) Officer : Police! Open up! (KNOCKS AT THE DOOR) Cam : No... Never forget. (GROANING) (DROPS KNIFE) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) You'd never guess, just lookin' at it. But you can feel it, right? There's... just something wrong. (SIGHS) Three-story executive with bad juju. Robin : How 'bout we leave that part out of the listing? You know, if it's too difficult showing it... I gave you my word. How are you feeling? Uh... I look like Frankenstein with my shirt off, but... I'll live. Okay, no, you can't look at me like that. You're gonna make me cry, and I hate crying. You're welcome. I'm very sorry. Now, you stay out of trouble, okay? Don't move into any cursed homes. And don't... befriend anyone with the last name "Henry," "Dahmer," or "Bundy." Deal. I'm gonna miss you, Robin. You're not. I'm gonna be crashing on your couch every other weekend. (LAUGHS) Right. (DYLAN LAUGHS) You take care of her! Don't worry about that. Just worry about selling this house. (SOFTLY) All right. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) We're gonna be okay, right? Better than okay. Now find me some music, something suitable for... Driving off into the sunset? I'll see what I can do. Radio Preacher : There is nothing that keeps wicked men, at any one moment, out of hell! Radio Preacher : But the mere... We need a new car. Preferably with Bluetooth. Yeah. You know what? New country it is. (MUSIC PLAYS) Under his roof Mama's tears like rain Nowhere to run From demons like his Too young I learned Home ain't where the heart is When home is where the hurt is The house has five bedrooms. Which, I know, sounds large for a family of three, but think about it, you could both have your own offices. There's bedrooms for guests. Plus, if you wanted to, you could open up your own B&B. People do it all the time. (CAT MEOWING) Robin : After you. (CAT MEOWING) Robin : The wood throughout is original, as is all the stained glass. (DOOR CLOSING) (CAT CONTINUES MEOWING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Here, kitty, kitty. You're such a pretty cat. (CAT MEOWS) Mmm.
