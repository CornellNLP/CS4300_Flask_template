 Woman : Previously on  Slasher... 
 Is my wife typically front-page news? 
 A husband and wife were slaughtered in their house... 
 [Yells out] 
 [Wails] 
 Wife's nine months pregnant, and the baby's cut from the womb. 
 Now that same baby, all grown-up, moves back into her old house. 
 That is a story. 
 [Screams] 
 Mrs. McBride? Oh, my... 
 It was him. He killed her. 
 You saw the murderer? 
 Yeah. It was The Executioner. 
 [Insects chirring] 
 [Birds twittering] 
 [Branch snaps] 
 What was that? 
 What? 
 Why are you so freaked out? 
 Why? Caleb, there was a murder. 
 Now that kid's gone missing. 
 He was friends with my sister... 
 [Sighs] Ash, trust me. 
 You're safe, okay? There's no one here. 
 Hello? 
 It's just you and me. 
 No one to hear us, no one to watch us... 
 I can do whatever I want to you... and no one would ever know. 
 Caleb, you're freaking me out. 
 Oh, you should be freaked out, because only one of us... is gonna make it out of here alive. 
 [Bellows] 
 [Caleb chuckles] 
 Caleb! 
 Jesus, I'm just playing with you. 
 No, you were playing with me, okay? 
 Now, I'm going home, asshole. 
 Ashley, no! Don't go. 
 Ash... I'm sorry! 
 I love you. 
 You love me? 
 [Ashley laughs] 
 [Soft moaning] 
 [Ashley and Caleb scream] 
 [Gasping] Help me... 
 Help me... 
 [Distant clanking] 
 [Groans] 
 Dylan? 
 Dylan : I'm just downstairs making breakfast! 
 You sleep okay? 
 [Children chattering outside] 
 So Alison wanted me to go down to Collingwood to cover Verna's funeral, so I used the power of delegation to send one of the junior reporters. 
 Three people showed up. Three. 
 Apparently, Verna McBride was as popular in death as she was in life. 
 Dylan. 
 Just staying the facts, babe. 
 Half of the town wanted Verna McBride dead. 
 It's a long list of suspects. 
 [Sighs] "For Sale" sign went up next door. 
 Jeez, that was fast. 
 I'm gonna ask Robin how much they want for it. 
 Why? 
 Just curious, I guess. 
 How about we take it easy today, huh? 
 Yeah, I got too much to do and not enough time to do it in. 
 You remember my old apartment? That dump? 
 There was three murders within a one-mile radius all within the space of a year. 
 These things happen. 
 Yeah, but I bet they weren't chopped up into little pieces. 
 So are you saying... 
 You wanna go back? 
 No, I'm saying... 
 Yeah, I don't know what I'm saying. 
 I worry about you. 
 Well, don't. 
 I'm actually tougher than I look. 
 Uh-huh. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Oh... 
 [Laughs] If that's another gift basket, or somebody asking for a cup of sugar, I'm gonna hurt somebody. 
 Coming! 
 Grandma. 
 Surprise. 
 You know you really didn't have to come. I'm fine. 
 Are you? Are you really? 
 Hey, Brenda. It's just the one bag? 
 Well, I'm not moving in. 
 You know what? 
 A hundred bucks says they find this freak before the week's out. 
 Oh, well, from your lips to God's ears. 
 But, still, I wanna stay here with you until they do. 
 Of course. 
 Of course. 
 Yeah. I just wish the house wasn't such a mess... 
 Don't worry about any of that, or me. 
 I spent half my life here in this lovely town, I can certainly take care of myself. 
 Okay, I'm just gonna put this up in the guest room. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Hey, Alison. 
 This is all right, isn't it? 
 Yes. 
 I'm glad you're here. 
 Well, I wish you weren't staying in this house. 
 Grandma, it's just a house. 
 Sarah, that was Alison. 
 They found Malcolm, the kid that went missing. 
 Where? 
 In the woods. 
 He's half alive, but alive. 
 Thank God... 
 It's great news. Listen, I gotta go. 
 I will call you when I know more, okay? 
 See you. 
 What the hell is that all about? 
 Some good news. Finally. 
 [Distant train passing] 
 You're gonna sell Aunt Verna's house for what it's worth, you got that? 
 I will do my best, Trent. 
 I dated a real-estate agent for two years. 
 So, trust me, I know all your tricks. 
 Maybe you can teach me some of them. 
 I'm gonna make you work for that commission, Robin. 
 Sarah! Let me help. 
 Ah, hey. 
 Want me to give you a hand? 
 Yeah, that would be great. Thanks. 
 No, thank you. I finally have someone to have my lunches with. 
 Well, this is hardly a desert island. 
 No, see, I am an island in a sea of weirdoes. 
 [Engine revs] 
 [Exhaust rumbling] 
 Case in point. 
 Clearly. 
 That's Joe, the barber across the road who's obsessed with trains. 
 It's all he can talk about. 
 Carol is three doors down... 
 She runs the Knitting Factory and will only eat white things. 
 I'm serious. Like milk, potatoes, cauliflower, rice... 
 It's weird. 
 Right... 
 Well, how do you know I'm not some weirdo? 
 Because weird things happen to you. 
 Yin and yang. 
 Here I am. 
 Oh... 
 Ah. 
 What's that paint chip number? 
 Thirty-four? Thirty... Thirty-five. 
 Aztec Lily. That's exotic. 
 Robin, can I ask you a nosy question? 
 Shoot. 
 How much are you asking for Verna McBride's place? 
 Way too much. 
 Linoleum countertops, potential. Knob-and-tube wiring, challenging. 
 Leaky basement, throw enough money at it, you can fix it... 
 But house with a past? 
 No amount of paint or potpourri can mask. 
 The woman was drawn and quartered in the master... 
 I like this. Is it expensive? 
 Sorry... 
 I don't always think before I speak. 
 The market dictates, is what I'm trying to say. 
 So, that house will... 
 Not sell in about a hundred years. Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 My advice? Sit on your place. 
 At least for the time being, just let all this blow over. 
 Thanks. 
 Oh! I almost forgot... 
 What's this? 
 An invite to our annual Summer Solstice Social tomorrow afternoon. 
 Officially, it's a fundraiser for the Food Bank. 
 Unofficially, it's a chance for us to channel a little Bacchanalia. 
 [Laughs] Sun salutations and blackberry sangria? 
 Yeah. 
 You guys really went all out, huh? 
 Oh, Waterbury is normally a very sleepy town. 
 Tomorrow night, we're gonna party. 
 Hard. All night long. 
 [Sarah laughs] Thanks for the help. 
 [Melancholy folk-pop song] 
 [Music becomes up-tempo] 
 [Door opens] 
 Oh, I'm sorry. We're actually not open yet. 
 Sarah : Um... 
 Can I help you? 
 I'm sorry, but... 
 Why are you stealing my mail? 
 Sorry, what... 
 This is my mail. 
 Okay. 
 Waterbury Drugs, do you see? 
 Yeah, I... I see it. 
 The cash register, it used to be... right there. 
 And that's where the camera used to be. 
 Okay... 
 It... It's Heather, isn't it? 
 Right? 
 You know, why don't you come back when the gallery's really open. 
 I can put aside any mail that... 
 Heather : You know, Benny, he... 
 He worked the store every Saturday. 
 And he took... Took an X-Acto knife... and he carved our initials right here. 
 Benny and Heather, forever. 
 You really think I'm just gonna let you and a bunch of homos steal everything from us? Huh? 
 Okay, you need to leave now. 
 No, 'cause they promised me. 
 "Oh, we'll be patient. Don't you worry." 
 Nothing's gonna change. 
 No, we give you our word. 
 You're an institution. 
 "We respect you." [Scoffs] 
 Heather, if you don't leave right now, I'm calling the police. 
 They're useless. 
 [Indistinct muttering] 
 That's just great. 
 [Discordant instrumental] 
 [Gasps] Oh! God... 
 [Indistinct police chatter] 
 Why would The Executioner send me Verna McBride's finger? 
 Can we quit referring to him as The Executioner, like he's some goddamn super-villain? 
 That's what you're worried about? What I'm calling him? 
 I'm worried about arousing unnecessary panic. 
 Yeah, well, it's a little late for that, sir. 
 There's a serial killer attacking... 
 Once. He's killed once. 
 That does not make him a serial killer. 
 Now, this envelope doesn't have an postage on it, which means that somebody had to drop it off. 
 Do you remember anybody dropping anything off to your establishment? 
 Well... 
 Heather Peterson was here. She went through my mail. 
 You don't think she could've done it? 
 What about the note, the Bible sh1t? What's that about? 
 "Men will go into caves of the rocks and into holes of the ground" before the terror of the Lord and the splendor of His majesty "when he arises to make the Earth tremble." 
 Yeah, the quote is Isaiah 2:19, but I don't know the significance of the numbers on the bottom. 
 Hm. Mrs. Bennett... 
 I don't go to church, so I don't know what any of this means. 
 But I do know this... 
 Verna McBride had a lot of enemies, and one of them wanted her dead. 
 Now he or she is piggybacking her murder onto what happened to your parents. 
 It's a smoke screen. 
 And you don't think it could be something else? 
 Like what? 
 I don't know... 
 Maybe Verna's the first, and the killer's on a mission. 
 A mission? 
 Why... Why is everyone pretending that everything's okay? 
 You know, you're renting cottages, you're organizing fundraisers, you're going fishing... 
 I mean, what you need to be doing is telling people they're in danger. 
 I'm sorry, what I need to do? 
 Yeah. What you need to do. 
 Mrs. Bennett, life is not a mystery novel. 
 Now, I appreciate your concern, but... 
 I got this under control, all right? 
 Come here. 
 [Distant train roars by] 
 What are you trying to tell me? 
 [Insects chirring] 
 [Cell phone vibrates] 
 Damn it. 
 Hold on a sec. 
 Are you seriously answering that? Are you seriously still wearing your shirt? Okay. Now... Unload those pants. [Disharmonic strings] Oh, yeah... Oh, look at you. Big boy. What would you do to me if you were here? Well, I'd start with removing... [Moans] Oh, come on...! Oh, no. No... Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. [Atonal orchestration] [Pulsating percussion] [Staccato drumming] [Pulsating percussion] What the...? [Rapidly disharmonic instrumental] [Grunts] Help! Help! Help! [Robin panting] [Grunts] sh1t! Help...! [Robin panting, pounding on door] Help! Help! [Indistinct yelling] sh1t! Oh! Help! Help...! [Robin screaming] Don't think he'll whack through. [Screaming] Hey. Hi. I just... How's he doing? They've sedated him, so he's sleeping. Finally. Vaughn's giving him 24-hour protection till they catch whoever did this. Good. You know, Heather Peterson paid me a visit yesterday. She said some pretty awful things about the two of you. You buy up half the town, you're gonna piss off a lot of people. You're gonna make enemies. Like...? I don't know, Mayor Edwards? Trent McBride? Honestly, Sarah, we could be here all day. [Sighs] Heather's crazy, but she's harmless. Are you sure about that? I'm sure. Robin : Justin... I should... Yeah, of course. Here. Thanks for the flowers. What's the matter, babe? Hi. What's the matter? You okay? I keep looking for patterns, you know? But there isn't any. Each attack is different. What was Verna, except being a bitch? And why did he give me back the tapes she stole? Or why does he kill some people but let others go? I didn't kill Alan Henry. I could have, but I only wanted to hurt him. Well, is that what happened to Robin? The Executioner's just trying to scare him or punish him? From what you said, it sounds like he was interrupted. Or she? It means Robin's still in danger. The Executioner also sent me this. Sarah : It's a Bible quote. Isaiah 2:16. Yeah. But the numbers on the bottom, they don't mean anything. There's no Isaiah 81, and Isaiah 45:3 is about hidden treasures, so... Those aren't Bible verses, Sarah. Those are geographic coordinates. Where is he? It's a spot just outside of town. You can't go out there by yourself. Excuse me? Sarah, you can't go out there alone. No, no. I heard what you said, but you know... You know we're not friends, so... you can't tell me what I can and cannot do. Sarah. [Door unlocks, buzzes] Dylan. Hi, Brenda. Hey. I want to talk to you about Sarah. Well, I don't know what there would be to talk about. Listen, I don't think she's safe here in Waterbury. I think she's in danger. Yeah, there's a psycho killer on the loose. Everyone's in danger. Yeah, but I think she'd be better with me at home. Well, she doesn't agree, and it's her decision. Ah... Because she won't leave you. But if you let her... If I let her. You really don't understand how this works, do you? Sarah's not mine. I can't tell her what she can and cannot do. She's my partner. My equal in everything. And I know you think I stole her from you, but the fact is, she was never yours to steal. So get over it. It's her decision. End of discussion. Good talk, though. Nice bike, princess. [Flies buzzing] [Dissonant orchestration] "Men will go into caves of the rocks..." [Grunts] Oh... [Gasps] 
 
 [Discordant orchestration] This could've been a trap. He could've been luring you here to kill you, Mrs. Bennett. Then we'd be carting two bodies out. I'm sorry. Chief, no one is more upset about this than I am. But the killer led Sarah directly to a body. Do we know who it is and why now? I need to talk to you for a second. We found an ID on the remains. It's Peter McBride, isn't it? Verna McBride shot him. What exactly does that mean? Tom Winston has a theory. A theory? Do you know about this? No, sir. Tom thinks The Executioner's killing people for their sins. The seven deadly sins. Verna's was anger, and the biblical punishment for anger is being dismembered alive. Wow, I guess my work here is done, huh? Because Tom Winston has gone and figured it out for me. This is a murder investigation, do you understand? And if you think I'm gonna give any credence to the ramblings of the town's resident serial killer, you're out of your goddamn mind. It's a theory, Cam. Yeah, one of many. Look, maybe you should put a little more faith in the police than faith in the guy who murdered your parents, huh? We need to get our hands on that movie. I asked Vaughn for them. They're all in Evidence. Well, I'd ask for them back, but I'm pretty sure he hates my guts. Okay, so, Peter McBride joins the circus, he starts screwing with... Sorry. Acting with your mother. No, no. There's no need to sugarcoat it. Alison : Start small... What do you film? [Moans] Before he knows it, Peter McBride is with Rachel  and Brian almost every night. What he wasn't getting at home,  he was getting from them. But this is a small town. Secrets have a way of getting out. When Verna discovered all those nights he said Was too much for her.  She snapped. [Rifle cocks] [Gun fires] It's a pretty interesting theory. Got any proof? The McBride's have always been a dysfunctional family. Rumor has it Peter married Verna to straighten himself out. Yeah, and wind up with a big fat hole in his head. Hey, guys, listen up. I need the contact info of everybody in Verna McBride's circle. Relatives, coworkers, people she went to church with. Let's see if she talked to anybody about her marriage, her husband... Anything. All right? Good work, Sarah. If this whole... art gallery thing doesn't work out, maybe we could use you around here. sh1t. Brenda? Sonja... Whoa, what a surprise. It's... It's been awhile. Wow... How are you? Really good. Did you hear about Verna McBride? Oh... I heard that she was chopped up into tiny little pieces. Filleted, heart stolen right out of her body. Yeah, I'm not sure how accurate that is... Well, Ronnie wouldn't give me all the gory details. Said I'd be up half the night. You know he's mayor? Yeah, I heard, I heard. Congratulations. Who'd have thought that a big lunk-head like him, would one day run this place? Yeah. Strange how life turns out. It is. It is. I'm just... So, how long are you staying with Rachel? What? Rachel must be so glad that you're here. Just... You know, what a way to move to a new town. It's Sarah. Sorry? You said Rachel. Rachel was my daughter. It's Sarah. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah. Oh, dear. I... Gosh. I didn't even think. I... She looks so much like her mother. I even said to Ronnie, it was like... It was like seeing a ghost. Anyway, she's home so I should get going. Oh, of course. Yep. Okay. Okay, it was really nice to see you, Brenda. Yeah, yeah. Don't you be a stranger now. Grandma? Grandma, what are you doing? I thought you were staying for a few days. Did Dylan say something... Did you guys have another fight? No, but you just confirmed one thing. He doesn't want me here. Yeah, but I do, okay? So... So, calm down, and tell me what's going on. It's just too damn hard. This town, this house. I can't. [Sobs] It's gonna be okay. No, Sarah. It isn't. That's the point. I want to protect you, but tell me, how do I do that? You're in danger. Oh, please come home with me. Please... No. I can't. Why not? What is keeping you here? I don't know, I haven't even unpacked... Exactly! The gallery isn't open, Dylan's at work all the time anyway, and if it's this house? Sarah, I should've sold this place years ago. It wasn't yours to sell. Sweetheart, coming back was a mistake. This psychopath has struck twice... Three times, now. So, let's go home. There's nothing for you here. Why didn't you tell me about my parents? About their movies? I... How... How do you know about that? I watched them. Sarah... Oh, my God. Your father... He forced your mother to do those awful things... No, she looked pretty willing to me. How did you find them? Sarah, tell me. How did you find them? Tom Winston. Okay? He told me where to look. You went to see Tom Winston? That's not the point. You lied. How could you go and see that animal? Because he's the only one that's telling me the truth! The truth? Fine... Tom Winston sliced open your mother's abdomen. And I don't mean a Cesarean. He used a machete to rip her open and tear you out of her while she was still alive. And he plunged that into her neck with so much force, the tip of the blade broke off and stuck in the floor behind her head. And then Tom Winston, that wise old man, he left my daughter on the floor, on this floor, right here, to bleed out and finally die. And that's the truth, Sarah. Ah... Just help me with this. Honey, you didn't have to do this. We have three at home. Yeah, three old ones. And if you take a look, you'll see that I uploaded all your favorite TV shows. [Gasps] You are awesome... But I already knew that. You already did, too. What? Why don't I cancel today? Bring you home, hire a private nurse. That way you can convalesce in style. Mm-mm. The fundraiser is too important. Hey... You are more important. Thank you. But I think I can rough it out here. I've got flowers, and a high-tech bed, a fancy new tablet... Justin, babe. Talk to me. What is it? I wasn't there for you last night. No, I wasn't with you. If I had been, I wouldn't have been alone... And an easy target. Do not feel guilty about what happened. Now, it looks like Cam benches about a hundred pounds more than you. Hey... Plus, he knows how to use a gun, and I think Jiu-Jitsu. Be safe. Fine. But I am coming right back here afterwards, okay? Deal. I love you. [Cam clears his throat] Hey. So, what do you bench press anyways, Cameron? Why? Man : Saul the Tarsus, later known as the apostle, Paul. He hated this new religion called Christianity. As for Saul, he made havoc of the Church. Entering into every house, and hailing men and women, committed them to prison. Now, why would God convert an enemy of his only son Jesus? Because God is able to convert... even the most unlikely of souls. Does your scar still hurt? No. But it is a reminder... of the sinner I once was. Yes. You were a sinner, that I remember. An enemy of Jesus, like Saul of Tarsus before you. And God, in His wisdom, He used me that night, didn't He, Pastor? To help bring you over to the light? [Sobs] What's wrong? I don't think I can do this, Tom. I don't think I can stay strong. You can, and you must. [Sobbing] [Indistinct chatter] [Sighs] Would you please sit down? I can't concentrate. I'm about to find out if Teagan slept with Harry's husband on their trip to Cabo. I'm not here to watch TV, Robin. [Cell phone vibrates] Can you get my phone? Man  (on PA):  Dr. Peters for the CTU. Dr. Peters for the CTU. Please. It's Justin. Thank you. Hey, beautiful. What's shakin'? I'm just calling to see how you're doing. Mm... Snug as a bug in a rug. These pain pills are good. Maybe a little too good. I'm sure they are, but promise me you'll take it easy. And don't make Cam too uncomfortable, okay? Done and done. So, are you having fun at your little social? I'd be having a lot more fun if you were here with me, but it's gonna be a good turnout. I'm glad. Anyways, boo, I should probably let you get back to it. Yeah, I should get back. I love you. I love you. [Exhales, sniffs] Oh... Now, I am serious, sit your ass down... and let me introduce you to some hot little housewives from... who the hell knows where. [Indistinct audio from tablet] Sit. Okay, now... She's a slut. She... She's a bigger slut, and that's her mother. She's like the queen slut of all sluts. [Up-tempo jazz] Dylan : Wow... How much do you think a place like this costs? House right on the water? The land alone must cost a fortune. No, they got the land for a steal. Family needed to sell, and the word is Justin paid in cash. Those two have horseshoes up their butts. Well, Robin might disagree. [Stutters] I didn't mean, like... Ladies and gentlemen... I want to thank each and every one of you for coming out. As you know, we've been through some rather trying times the last couple of days, but Robin is on the mend... So, please, raise your glasses. To Robin. To a speedy recovery. And to providing everything we can to those less fortunate in our great community. All : Cheers. Woman : To Robin. No, that's bullshit. Teagan knew Hailey and Hunter wanted to try and make things work. Yeah, but Teagan has a borderline personality disorder. They diagnosed it last season. It was such a good episode. They were on this yacht down in the Caribbean, one of the women is married... [Loud clicking] [PA beeps] Code Gray. What's going on? I don't know. Code Gray. Hospital-wide power outage... Wait, where are you going? I'm gonna find out. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. It's happening. He's coming back to finish the job. It's a power outage, okay? I'll be right back. Can't someone else go? Don't worry... I got this. [PA beeping]  Code Gray. Code Gray. Hospital-wide power outage.  Code Gray. [Mutters indistinctly] [Beeping grows louder] [Gasps] Sorry. [PA continues beeping] Robin : Cam? Cam, is that you? [Percussions increase tempo] Cam? Who is it?! [Loud thud] Who the hell are you, huh? What are you doing here? The flowers... I'm delivering the flowers. Woman  (on PA):  Code Gray ended. Power restored. Jesus Christ. Cam : Hey... Sorry, buddy. [Indistinct hospital chatter] [Robin laughs] They're probably from Justin. He can be a little excessive. You don't say. Is this a joke? Uh, there's a card in here. What is it? "To Robin, my condolences on your loss." My loss? Oh, Jesus Christ... Chief, this is Cam. We were wrong,  Robin's not the target. It's Justin. Say that again? Justin Faysal is the target. Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me. Thank you. Thank you. Justin... Justin. Can I have a word with you? Ah, can it wait a sec? We just got some news about Robin. We need to talk. [Justin exhaling violently] You all right...? Don't! Don't touch me. All right, all right... [Moaning loudly] [Breathes violently] [Yells, gagging] Justin? I need someone to get a pillow or jacket. You need to call an ambulance! This is Chief Vaughn. I need an ambulance to the Faysal property right away. [Groans loudly] June : Justin? You're gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. [Violently groans] [Yells out] [Melancholy electric guitar wails] [Police sirens approaching] [Throbbing reverb] [Throbbing tempo increases] Cam... Vaughn : Heather? [Whispers] Come on. [Knocking] Heather? Police : Door's locked. Police : Heather? Heather : No, no. You can't come in. Police : We know about Justin. No, no, no! You can't come in! No! [Overlapping shouting] No, you can't...! No! No! No... No, no! We just wanna ask a few questions. Get out of here! You ruin everything! [Heather sobs] Everything! Vaughn : Hey, hey. It's okay, it's okay... Cam : You got it? [Wailing] You know, serial killers all have their own M.O.'s. But this killer dismembers Verna McBride, he beats that kid to a pulp, he slashes Robin to ribbons, but he leaves him alive, and his husband snorts poison and dies. What? He or she... is smart. A magician. Got you looking over here, while he was killing over there. Fine. He's the Houdini of serial killers. But I've done my research, okay? None of the punishments for deadly sins involve poison. Okay. What kind of poison was used? The preliminary report says... Brodifacoum, bromadiolone and strychnine. The Biblical punishment for gluttony is to be force-fed rats, toads and snakes. Rat poison. Indeed. Yeah, but gluttony... It doesn't make sense. Justin could've been on the cover of a  Men's Health  magazine. Gluttony isn't about food, it's about consumption. Hedonism. Excess. Fine. Justin liked to do drugs, he had a massive habit. He probably spent more in a week than I earn in a year. Who cares? You are absolutely right, who cares? As with Verna McBride, there must be something else. Something hidden. You've only just scratched the surface, Sarah. There's so much more to uncover. Trust me. Trust you? I have never lied to you. But people in this town, they lie all the time. Everybody has a secret. Vaughn :  Secrets they take to the grave. Secrets they're willing  to kill to protect. [Loud crash, woman screaming] [Melancholy instrumental]
