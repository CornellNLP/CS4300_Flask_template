 [ clinking, rustling ] 
 Two months suspended vacation with pay. 
 This is absurd. 
 There are worse things. 
 Like what? 
 Two months suspended  without  pay. 
 And all because you let that kid follow you around all night? 
 Well, they said I should have called C.F.S. 
 Why didn't you? 
 Well, he's a good kid who was worried about his mom. 
 You're a good man. 
 That's where I'll be. 
 Ooh. 
 First I got to spend a whole shift with Gina Perello, the hag they're sending to run this place... 
 [ Knocking ] While I'm gone. 
 [ Clears throat ] Dr. Taylor? 
 Who the hell are you? 
 The hag. 
 [ Telephones ringing ] 
 Yah! 
 Where's my wife? 
 [ Grunts ] Where's my son? 
 Frank, you have to try not to move. 
 I told him I didn't want to go first. 
 [ Whimpers ] Where's my family? 
 E.T.A.? 
 Three minutes out. 
 Mr. Irving? 
 They'll be here soon, but you need to calm down. 
 I told them not to take me first. 
 What do we have? 
 Jesse : I've called the O.R. 
 Guthrie Junior is on his way down. 
 Did they say what's coming in? 
 No, just be out here, stat. 
 [ Sirens wailing ] 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 Police escort? 
 [ Tires screech ] Whoa. 
 What is it? 
 It's a home invasion. 
 This is the mom and the son now. 
 Father's in Center Stage. 
 Jesse : Vitals are stable. 
 10 of morphine, please. 
 [ Frank gasps ] Wow. 
 The knife barely missed his heart. 
 Miracle he made it here without perforating the pericardium. 
 We have them to thank for that. 
 Nobody here wants to leave until they see this family survive. 
 Let's stabilize the knife and transport upstairs. 
 We don't need it nicking a vessel en route. 
 Aah! 
 Paramedic : 17 year-old male. 
 20-foot fall. Deformity to left foot. 
 Probable hip dislocation. 
 Multiple bruises and lacerations to his face. 
 Fell from where? 
 Jumped from the second story. 
 Aah! 
 Paramedic : 42-year-old female. 
 15-centimeter full-thickness laceration involving muscle to the right proximal arm. 
 Pete?! 
 Mom! Mom, are you okay?! 
 I'm okay, I'm okay! 
 Wait, wait, wait, mom! 
 Pete! 
 Your mom's in good hands, son. 
 We got to get you inside. 
 How's my father? Please! 
 Your father's inside. I don't know his status. 
 This kid pulled himself by his arms to the neighbor's house. 
 He saved them all. 
 Please tell me that Frank is alive. 
 Okay, when we move him, let's move him nice and easy. 
 No bumps, people. No bumps. 
 [ Groans ] 
 Pete! 
 Is that my father? 
 Oh, my god! 
 Frank, please don't move. 
 Is my son okay? 
 They're taking good care of him. 
 Karen?! 
 I'm okay. I'm okay. 
 Oh, Frank! 
 She's not attached. On me. One, two, three. 
 [ Groans ] 
 Trauma labs, please? 
 Cole : Two, three. Move him now. 
 Aah! 
 Guthrie : Jesse, gonna need a portable X-ray over here. 
 Flying in. 
 [ Groaning ] 
 Son, stay still. You've got a dislocated hip. 
 Karen : Pete! 
 Dr. Leighton, pulse-check that leg. 
 [ Pete groaning ] 
 I've got a pulse here. 
 I don't have a pulse down here. 
 Damn it. 
 What does that mean? 
 [ Pete groaning ] 
 Go. Clear. Shoot it. 
 [ Beeping ] [ Groaning ] 
 Cole : Okay, we're moving him now. 
 Leanne : Careful. 
 But... 
 Mom! Please let me see them first. 
 No time. We have to move. 
 Let them see each other. 
 This is not your patient. There's no time. 
 There  is  time. 
 Frank, turn your head very slowly. 
 Okay? 
 Ugh. 
 [ Groaning ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 I... I love you. 
 Dad, I love you. 
 You saved us, kiddo. 
 We're gonna be okay now. 
 I love you both. 
 Slowly. 
 Okay, slowly, let's go. 
 Whoa! 
 [ Monitor alarms beeping ] 
 Damn it! 
 What's happening? 
 I don't have a pulse! 
 Okay, Dr. Pineda, start compressions. 
 Back, back, back. Coming in, coming in. 
 Gown up, gown up. 
 Frank?! 
 What's happening to my father? 
 Someone say something! 
 You're gonna do that down here? 
 We have no choice now. 
 Pulseless in the E.D. We have to explore the wound. 
 May be a thoracic injury. 
 Jesse. 
 ♪ 
 Okay, we should do this now. 
 Pete, your hip was knocked out of its socket when you jumped, all right? 
 We're gonna have to straighten it. 
 Karen : Is that... is that gonna hurt him? 
 We'll give him some medication. 
 Mario, can you help over there, please? 
 Mario : Line in. 
 Amy, 7 amphetamine. 
 Yes, doctor. 
 [ Groans ] Okay, everybody ready? 
 One... 
 Mom, mom, I'm scared. 
 Two... 
 Shh, shh. 
 Three. 
 [ Popping ] [ Screaming ] 
 [ Groaning ] 
 [ Crying ] 
 Pete : Which one's dead? 
 One of the medics said that you killed one. 
 Was it the big guy or the small guy? 
 Sir, can we wait until my husband is out of surgery to do this? 
 Well, I have to get a statement, ma'am. 
 The big guy. The small one was in custody. 
 The big guy was the one with the gun. 
 The one who separated us. 
 Doctor, is... is... is he okay to be interviewed like this? 
 Dr. Leighton signed off on it. 
 Now, you said you were separated. 
 Is that how you ended up upstairs? 
 Yeah. Upstairs bathroom. 
 Can you walk me through what happened? 
 He tied my wrists and ankles with rope. 
 Then he slammed my head into the mirror. 
 He said to stay put, and I did. 
 For a long time. 
 Too long. I... I waited for too long. 
 If I had just jumped earlier... 
 It's all my fault. 
 All your fault?! 
 Pete, you saved us. 
 If I had jumped sooner, dad would have never been... 
 Stop. Stop it right now. 
 Your mom's right, son. You're a hero. 
 I think it's a good time for a break, don't you? 
 Yeah. I'll come back. 
 You're younger than I expected. 
 Vitamin "C" cream and exercise. 
 I tried exercise once. It didn't take. 
 Look, I know you're worried that I'm gonna burn this place down, but I know the job. 
 I did it in Sacramento last year when they booted their guy. 
 I wasn't booted. Paid leave. 
 Well, to-may-to, to-mah-to. 
 The point is, don't worry. 
 I'm gonna take good care of the place till you get back. 
 Why does the board like you so much? 
 Handies. 
 MBA from Yale, Columbia Med School, and admin training at Mass Gen. 
 You had me at "handies." 
 Angus : What do we have here? 
 Officer : 27-year-old male. 
 Good pupil reactivity, intoxicated and unconscious. 
 Officer 2 : On his wa to his wedding in Mexico, this idiot and five of his friends got drunk at the airport and got thrown off their flight. 
 Where are the others? 
 Jail, except for this one. 
 I have a stronger constitution. 
 Impressive. Has he had anything else? 
 Just Tequila. We screwed up. 
 You think? 
 Ooh. I can smell him from here. 
 Hello. I'm Dr. Perello, director of the E.R. 
 Officers, why don't you head to the break room, have some coffee... Where is the break room? 
 Uh, before you go, are these restraints really necessary? 
 Sir, step back, please. 
 Why should I? 
 Ugh! 
 That's why. 
 That's why. 
 Bathroom? 
 Dr. Perello, uh, say hello to... 
 Two of our fine... 
 Still don't know our names. 
 You're Dr. Leighton, right? 
 Yeah. 
 The nepotist. 
 Nepotist? 
 Relax, I'm kidding. 
 Well, half-kidding. Your father is on the board. 
 Heh. 
 And you're Dr. Lorenson? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You two go to the bathroom together too? 
 Excuse me? 
 Well, I was just wondering why I've got two residents on one drunk. 
 Divide and conquer. 
 Continue the tour? 
 Uh, was the bleeding accompanied by pain? 
 Mali : He had a sore throat, so he's been on vocal rest for the past week. 
 Until today. 
 No singing at all? 
 Mnh-mnh. No singing and no speaking. 
 It's common practice among performers. 
 A lot of writing notes. 
 Why did he sing today? Was the sore throat gone? 
 They are in rehearsals for a very special performance for the presidents of South Africa and the United States at Walt Disney Concert Hall. 
 I read about that. You're in "The Lion King"? 
 In the touring company, yes. 
 He is Mufasa. 
 Oh. 
 Dr. Pineda, do you have a diagnosis yet? 
 It's hard to see through the swelling. 
 We'll need a C.T. scan. 
 I believe there's an abscess in your throat. 
 It's like a balloon filled with fluid. 
 Can you make him better? 
 We'll know more after we take some pictures. 
 Uh, Dr. Pineda, never wait for a test to form an opinion. 
 Machines don't diagnose patients. 
 We  do. 
 Cole : Now I'm gonna slowly pull the knife out  while you return the ligament to its place. 
 Watch for the nerve. Suction. [ Beep ] Hey. How's he doing? He's well-trained. Doesn't waste a step. I meant the patient. Of course. [ Chuckles ] That knife tore him up pretty good. Sounds like it hit the spleen, a lung, and the top of the liver. It's a miracle he's alive at all. Tell me something, Leanne. How did you break through to Cole? What do you mean? Well, you seem to have made a connection. We don't have a connection. Well, I can see he likes you. I really want this to work out for him, Leanne. I just... I'm just trying to find a way in. I thought maybe you had some advice for me. I wish I could help you, Rollie, but... Other than a working relationship, I don't really know him at all. [ Door closes ] 68-year-old male with metastatic melanoma. Had chemo today. Found down at home by his son. Low B.P... 87/58. Temp 100.8, pulse is thready. Dad? I'm right here, okay? Neal : Gonna need you over here, Dr. Lorenson. Let's get him to Bed 7. On my count. One, two, three. Be... be careful. He has dementia. He freaks easily. Got it. We'll take care of him. Dr. Lorenson, walk me through this. Airway's intact. Pulse weak and thready. Breath sounds. Diffuse crackles throughout. Cap refill poorly perfused. Probable sepsis pneumonia. What's his fluid status? I.V.C. collapsed. He's extremely dehydrated. No access. Veins are flat. What's your plan? [ Monitor alarms beeping ] Quickly... B.P. Is dropping. Sepsis protocol... fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics. Pressors if it gets that far. Good. Next. 2 liters wide open into each I.V. Levophed ready to go, please. You got it, doctor. Is he okay? [ Beeping continues ] [ Beeping stops ] Blood pressure's improving. He's stable. [ Laughs ] Lawrence walked right into the orchestra seats, took the girl's cell phone, and kept right on singing. [ Laughter ] Nathan: He just tossed it right to Phil, that new Hyena. That was the first casualty of their stampede. [ Laughter ] Hi, everyone. I'm Dr. Rorish. Sorry, but we normally don't allow more than one visitor in Trauma 1. These are Lawrence's castmates. I understand, but it's policy. Do you mind waiting outside, please? Yes. Yes, of course. Lawrence, we'll be right outside. Yep. Thanks. Mr. Falls, you have a large peritonsillar abscess. It's a severe infection deep inside your throat. And the swelling of it has spread to the vocal cords. Is there medication you can give him? Steroids and antibiotics will help, but it needs to be drained. And will that fix it? It's the only way to stop the infection. We won't know about your voice for a couple of hours. But, Lawrence, you need to understand that this is an extremely delicate procedure. The abscess is wedged between the vocal cords and the carotid artery, which is the main source of blood to the brain. [ Sighs ] What does that mean? Think of it like... like a raisin inside a peanut-butter sandwich. We need to get the needle inside the raisin. But the trick is, we can't touch the peanut butter. No. [ Grunts ] Please, Lawrence. The problem is there's not much time. The abscess could burst at any moment, flooding the throat with infection. Lawrence, I understand you're worried about losing your voice. But it's my first job to make sure you don't lose your life. For my husband, they are one and the same. [ Indistinct talking ] Man : [ Over P.A. ]  Triage nurse to overflow nursing station. Triage nurse to overflow nursing station. Hi, I'm Dr. Leighton, and you are... Rachel, Aaron's fiance. Is he sober yet? He's sleeping it off. Rachel, I told you... He's gonna be fine. Shut up. I don't even know why you're here. He's not family, right, so... You're not family yet either, Rachel, so... We're getting married on Sunday. Can I see him? Unfortunately, you can't just yet. The police want to talk to him when he wakes up. Police? They were thrown off an airplane on the tarmac. The other guys are in jail. You idiots couldn't make it through a two-hour flight without getting hammered? This is all going to work out. Really, Matt? We're getting married in Mexico in two days. Half the wedding party is in jail, and my fiance is unconscious. How exactly is that gonna work out? [ Groans ] I saw "The Lion King" when it came to L.A. last year. Were you in the show? He was. And the 17 years before that. [ Chuckles ] Lawrence has been Mufasa since the very beginning. And he gets better every year. I've seen you perform four times, Lawrence. I brought my son to see you every time you came to L.A. The first time we came to see the show, he begged for a pet lion for months. So finally, my husband took our poor dog to the groomer... No. Mm-hmm. [ Both chuckle ] And one very tolerant labradoodle became our very own Mufasa. [ Laughs ] How old is he now, your son? Doctor? Is everything okay? Yes, of course it is. Uh, I'll be right back. Malaya, can you prep the procedure, please? Jesse : A lot of patients here tonight. I'll be right back. You're in good hands. ♪ When I came home from the hospital, there was a... a box from the police. With all of our personal effects. And among the items was... That CD. "The Lion King" cast recording. We must have listened to it, oh, maybe a few thousand times. And then it got lost. The accident must have shook it loose. [ Voice breaking ] Sometimes I think I'm being punished, and I don't know why. [ Exhales sharply ] Listen to me closely. [ Inhales ] [ Off-key ] ♪ Nants ♪ 
♪ Ingonyama bagithi baba ♪ 
♪ Ingonyama ♪ I'm still working on the lyrics. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] Paul, why are you here? You should be at the store. Uncle Paul died when I was 5. They owned a woman's-clothing store in Fullerton. 20 years ago. I have to get to the store now. Dad, dad, dad. It's me. It's Jeremy. Now lay down. It's my fault. I... I forgot his radio. Music always soothes him. Jeremy, can Dr. Lorenson and I talk with you privately? Dad, I'm gonna be right over there, okay? You're gonna be able to see me the whole time. A-all... all right. Jeremy, does your father have a "do not resuscitate" order? No. Why? Is there anyone you can call to join you here? Any other family? It's just me and my dad. I'm the one who gives him his medications. I bathe him, feed him, dress him. How old are you? 17? 18. Jeremy, this is hard, but the cancer has weakened your father's heart to the point where it could arrest at any time. If that happens, we have two options. We can try and get it working again, which will be painful and most likely unsuccessful, or we can make him more comfortable. Comfortable? So he can die? So he can rest. He's old and he's got cancer, so he's not worth saving, right? No, Jeremy. I've got to go back to him. 
 
 We'll get it for you. You know, it is late. You just... you just need some rest. Well, we've... we've got a lot of work to do. Is everything okay? Of course. Dr. Pineda, you'll lead. Mr. Falls, open your mouth, please. This will only take a minute. Make sure you see it first. I see it. And steadily advance into the abscess wall. [ Hissing ] We have suction. Got it. It's drained. Oh, my god. [ Monitor alarm beeping ] Leanne : Okay, sit him up, Jesse. What's happening? I've got you. Okay. Okay. Dr. Pineda, get in here now. Get back in there. We got you. It's gonna be okay. Did I hit the carotid? Get in here, Dr. Pineda, now. Dr. Pineda! [ Gagging ] Please do something. Dr. Pineda, get in here now. Gauze and pressure, please. [ Gagging ] Should we intubate? Should we, Dr. Pineda? No signs of expanding hematoma. Airway is opened. No intubation. I agree. Lawrence, just try to relax. That puncture of the carotid should seal itself in just a moment. Pull the gauze out and check. It's stopping. You okay? [ Grunts ] [ Wheezes ] Can you wait? All she does is worry when she's awake. It's better if she sleeps till my dad's out of surgery. Yeah, I'll give her another 20. What you did was pretty incredible. I wish everybody would just stop. I get it. You think because you waited, bad things happened. That's a fact. I don't know. I wasn't there. But I do know what a broken bone feels like. I know what a dislocated hip feels like. You were dead. You were all dead. Except you jumped out that window and you dragged yourself through unimaginable pain to get help. That  is a fact. There's gonna be times when there's nobody there to back you up, when the only thing you have is your eyes and your instincts. It's important that you trust yourself. And never, ever, ever give up on the patient. No matter what. [ Sighs ] Neal. What do we do about Jeremy? We respect his wishes. He has all the facts. There's more to this decision than just facts. I should talk to him again. You know, it's not our job to convince them to D.N.R. a loved one. We can't pretend to know what it's like to be faced with that kind of decision. I don't have to pretend. I've been where he is. I can talk to him. Okay. But be careful. Woman : Thank you, ma'am. So, you're the new Taylor? In a manner of speaking, sure. Brooklyn? I want to say, uh, Red Hook. Carroll Gardens. Very good. Nice. Finally, someone from my neck of the woods. Sorry, I'm Mario... Savetti. The long shot. What? Don't take it personally. I have to learn a lot of names very quickly. So that's how I remember you. The long shot? The least likely person to get here, and yet here you are. Mazel tov. Have you met Dr. Hudson? Neal. Prince charming. Uh, why do I get "long shot" and he gets "Prince Charming"? Well, I mean, look at him. Nice to meet you. Is he okay? He's just sleeping. Maybe you should check him again. He's fine. I promise. What? What is it? These marks around your eyes. The other doctor already checked me. My son jumped out of a window, and nobody will tell me if my husband is going to live or die. They're really all I care about right now. I understand. I'll, uh, see what I can find out. Hey, what did you find in Karen Irving's trauma survey? Checking up on me now? No, I'm checking up on  her. Why? I'm not sure. Do you mind if I take a look at her chart? You didn't order a C.T.A. of her head and neck? Why would I do that? She has some bruising around the eyes. She got tossed around a lot. A few bruises aren't worth a C.T.A. It just looks strange to me. Should I code "looks strange to Angus" on the insurance form? [ Scoffs ] A C.T.A. is not indicated. I think you're wrong. Not your patient, man. I looked up our new director, Gina Perello. Yale, Columbia, headed up an E.R. in Sacramento, same hospital group, and she ran about a dozen marathons. You're stalking. She's the new boss. That's all you need to know. It doesn't bother you they didn't give the job to Dr. Rorish? She would never want that job. Well, what about Guthrie? He's been here since dial-up. Dial-up wasn't that long ago. [ Indistinct talking over P.A. ] [ Police radio chatter ] People come out here for three reasons... To think about mistakes they've already made or the one that they're about to make. You know, that's only two. Smoke break is number three. But your mama knows he taught you better than that. [ Sighs ] What if two doctors disagree on how to treat a patient? That's an age-old question in this place. For a senior doc, it's more complicated. For a resident, it's simple. You don't know enough to sit on it. So you have to tell an attending. What patient are you talking about? It's the mom from the home invasion. Karen Irving. She has bruising under her eyes. What kind of bruising? I think it's petechiae. That's Mario's patient. He doesn't agree. But you're pretty sure you're right. Yeah, and I won't be sure without a C.T.A. That's a good thing, 'cause you just ordered one. Excuse me? Dr. Leighton, I'm a nurse. I take my orders from doctors, capiche? No, no. No, no. I-I-I can't do that. If it comes back clean, it's our secret. If not, you just saved two lives. Two? The patient and Dr. Savetti. [ Indistinct talking ] Hey. The nurses told me you were out here. Is my father okay? He's fine. He's sleeping. [ Sighs ] I know what you're gonna say. Every time we end up in a hospital, someone tells me it's time to let him go. My ex-husband told me the same thing when our son was sick. After two very painful years, he died. I couldn't even look at my husband. Not because I was angry that he'd given up, but because I couldn't face that he may have been right. Not a day goes by that I don't wonder [sighs] If I made my son work too hard to die. I'm sorry that happened to you. I really am. But I promised him. You promised who? My father. When he realized what was happening, he told me I'd have to grow up fast and be the man of the house now. I promised him I would. I can't break that promise. I have to fight for him. [ Monitor alarm beeping ] Dr. Leighton, your bachelor is seizing. [ Grunting ] Heart rate's 220. Roll him. Start suction. This doesn't make sense. He just had a hangover. Yeah, well, give me an E.T.A., all right? Call me back. I'm in Trauma 1. Where's my son? I'm here, dad. When the warranty runs out, you have to get rid of the car. That's what we used to say. Can you sit forward for me? [ Groans ] Dad. There we are. Jeremy. Yes? It's me, dad. It's Jeremy. What's my name? Your name is Edwin, dad. Edwin Mercer. Will you tell Jeremy his father is looking for him? I will. I'll tell him. Aaron had a heart attack. I need to know everything. It's the only way I'm gonna be able to help him. He drank too much. That's... I swear that's all... We don't have time for this! Do you get it? He is going to die. I need the truth now. It's cocaine. Aaron packed it in a condom. He said it would work. Are you saying he swallowed it? We thought it would just... Thank you. Go through him. It was for our honeymoon! Are you insane?! You turned Aaron into a drug mule?! Rachel! I need an endoscope at Center Stage, now! [ Defibrillator paddles buzzing ] I have your C.T.A. results on Karen Irving. I didn't order a C.T.A. on Karen. Dr. Savetti! I need you here now! What is it? Fireworks. He and his friends set them off. Container impaled him. It was a rocket. [ Chuckling ] We used black powder. Get it out, man. It hurts. Page Cole Guthrie, please. His pressure's down. Do something. Risa, I need a central-line kit. Dr. Lorenson, over here, please. He needs Levophed, possibly a second pressor. This is severe sepsis. Wh-what's sepsis? Sepsis is like bacteria eating holes into every millimeter of his blood vessels, causing the fluid to leak out. [ Voice breaking ] Is it painful? It is. Mario, I'm the only boss that matters. Totally. I was pulled out of surgery on a stabbing for this. It better be good. Foreign object in his abdomen, positive blood in Morison's. May have perforated his liver. Is that good enough for you? B.P. is dropping. Now 80/50. He's in shock. What's our access? Just a peripheral from the field. They can place a central line in a second, though. We'll take it from here. I want a thermal cordis while the E.R. patches him up for the O.R. Copy that. And nobody touch the firework. Dr. Guthrie, our residents handle procedures down here. Mario, central line, now. It's surgical management now. I'm the attending. You're the surgical attending... In Trauma 1. Maybe this isn't the time for interdepartmental warfare. We're all on the same team. Couldn't agree more, Dr. Hudson. Frank Irving's upstairs on his 22nd unit of blood. I'd like to get back to him before he flatlines. Done! Done! Let's run the fluids and get this guy upstairs. Now can I take my patient? All yours. Dr. Hudson, I've now got two criticals and I'm all out of surgeons. I could use your help upstairs. I'm not a surgeon. I'm an E.R. doc. We're all on the same team, right? [ Monitor alarm beeping ] Pete : Someone help my mom! Someone help my mom! All right, all right. We're gonna take care of her. What's happening to her?! I'm gonna turn you over here. Mom, are you okay? Why is she seizing? She's your patient, Savetti. You tell me. Dr. Hudson, are you coming, or did we just stabilize this kid for nothing? Dr. Pineda, I need you over here, please. Assist Dr. Lorenson with the pressors. Page me if there's any change. Clear the way. Gurney coming through! Clear the way! Yeah. Okay. Got it? Yeah. All right, careful now. Do you smell that? [ Fizzling ] Smoke. This firework's still live. Neal : I need water! May I? Is that smoke? I need another O.R. and another trauma attending. We're full! Page the trauma fellow on backup call. In the meantime, I'm taking him into the stabbing room. [ Monitor alarms beeping ] Dr. Leighton, facemask, please. Mama, where's that ativan? Line in. Slam it. [ Beeping stops ] Dr. Rorish, I think she has petechiae around her eyes. When did you first spot it? A couple hours ago. And you didn't do anything? I ordered a C.T.A. Then why didn't you act on the results? They haven't come back yet. It's up to you to fight for your patient, Dr. Savetti. How many units? We just hung number 30. 30? Okay, I need to get in. Dr. Hudson, help my team with the firework. Suction here, please. Clamp here, please. Another 0 silk. Kelley clamp, please. [ Monitor alarm beeping ] His blood pressure's bottoming out. Why? I don't know. I don't know. This required a complex dissection. You just pulled it. Wrong move. Let me in, please. So what's your plan? He's bleeding from his inferior epigastric artery. His wound didn't violate his rectus sheath. It's just a highly vascular spot. Suction, please. [ Hissing ] Tying off the inferior epigastric branch. Done. Hemostasis. Impressive. I don't see any abdominal violation here. [ Cellphone vibrating ] Lucky guy. Dr. Spencer, assist Dr. Hudson as he closes. I can't close. I've got a patient crumping downstairs. Doctor? You know I'm gonna have to steal you from Leanne, right? Let's get her comfortable and get her upstairs for a head CT. Mama, when Mrs. Irving comes back, can you make sure that she's someplace away from her son so that she and I have a chance to speak? Understood. Thanks. You two have some stuff to figure out. I get it. Lucky the patient didn't die. You're not lucky.  She  is. [ Monitor alarm beeping] Dr. Hudson, my dad! [ Edwin coughing ] He just started coughing for no reason. [ Coughing continues ] Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay, it's okay. There's literally no exchange. It's all fluid. Should we take him off saline? No, keep it running. What's happening? His lungs are filled with fluid. Check again. Check the X-ray. Jeremy, extra tests won't change what we already know. Well, if there's fluid in his lungs, why are you giving him more saline? You know, it's an impossible situation. His heart's failing. If we withhold fluids, then he'll die from his low blood pressure. But if we push fluids... He'll drown in his own lungs. What made you think it was petechiae? Because those guys separated them. Why separate them unless... Oh, man. Yeah. [ Pouring coffee ] Your seizing was very likely caused by anoxic brain injury. The damage isn't permanent. Thank you. Um, can you tell me how my husband is doing? He's still critical. But, Karen, we should talk about you. The little red marks on your face are called petechiae. They're tiny bruises that indicate strangulation. It's something that we look for when there's a chance of sexual assault. Karen... What happened to you? They separated us from the beginning. One of them brought me into the kitchen, pushed me into the pantry, and he put his hands around my neck. I thought I was gonna die. But I knew if he was hurting me, then he wasn't hurting them. They can't ever know. Frank and Pete. You can never tell them. Karen... Your husband and your son are some of the strongest people I've ever met. And so are you. What happened? You freaking scared the crap out of us is what happened. Aaron, you had a heart attack. The cocaine that you swallowed leaked and sent you into cardiac arrest. Where's Rachel? Hey, I never thought she was right for you, bro. What are you talking about? She's gonna be my wife. He should probably be more concerned with his prison wife. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. What? You have the right to speak with an attorney... I just feel like I'm looking in a circus mirror. Cole : Frank? Frank? It's okay. You're okay. It's out. What about my family? Well... How are they? They're here. Pete : Dad! Oh, god. Dad! [ Sobbing ] Karen : Frank. Frank. [ Sniffling ] Oh, my god, you're okay. Oh. It's okay. We're okay. We're okay. Love you, dad. You're responsible for that picture right there, Cole. We all are. He wants to be your friend, you know. Are you and I gonna be friends? [ Chuckles ] We're colleagues. I offended you when I asked you out. I'm just curious as to why. Why I asked you out? What made you think I'd say yes? Well, you don't ask someone out because you think they'll say yes. You ask someone out because you are interested. And... Why are you interested? It's been a long time since you felt someone look at you, isn't it? Stop. Okay, we're out of here in an hour. Let's start with breakfast. No. Why not? Because I said no. [ Chuckles ] I don't get it. It's not that complicated. There's a place in Silver Lake. It opens... I'm not ready. ♪ 10 minutes to sunrise. Doesn't feel that way. What would happen if I signed that form? We'd, uh, turn your father's machines off. And in a few minutes, he'd drift away. Would he feel anything? Well, no. No, he'd feel little, if any, pain. But he'd know you were there. No, he wouldn't. He hasn't known who I am in a long time. Maybe it would be enough that he'd know that he wasn't alone. Do you have any music? He's been waiting for you. Can he talk now? I think I have a better idea. ♪ Ingonyama nengw' enamabala ♪
