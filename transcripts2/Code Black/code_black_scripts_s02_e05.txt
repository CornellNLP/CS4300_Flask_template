 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Rain trickling] 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 [Motorcycle approaching] 
 [Engine revving] 
 [Engine turns off] 
 [Radio chatter continues] 
 You can't park that there. 
 Short-timers don't get parking spaces. 
 Yeah, you say you're a short-timer, but you've been here longer than most of the military guys. 
 A couple months, right? 
 Believe me, I'm working on it. 
 You have commitment issues on top of a death wish? 
 Hey, you see this helmet? 
 It's made with aramid and carbon fiber for exceptional strength and thermal stability. 
 Won't stop a semi. 
 Neither will a car. 
 I mean, seriously, why you keep bringing up this thing about you leaving? 
 'Cause I don't want you to get too attached, sweetheart. 
 Yeah. 
 Not a good idea in this place. 
 It's been two weeks, and I still can't stop thinking about Charlotte. 
 You expect that kind of thing in war, but... 
 But an American city in 2016? 
 Is there a difference? 
 Gentlemen, incoming on the roof. 
 Five minutes out. 
 Man : Let's go! Let's go! 
 He's breathing on his own. That's great news. 
 It's the best news. 
 I know. 
 Look, it's just gonna take some time for him to wake up. 
 There's no reason to be worried. 
 There's always reason to be worried. 
 We watched Charlotte get shot and killed... 
 This is not that. You know it. right here. 
 Hey. 
 You extubated Mike, and it worked. Okay? 
 You watched your brother take a breath. 
 This is great news for him. 
 You be happy about it. 
 All right. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Woman : Sweetie, slow down! 
 Sorry, Dr. Leighton. This one got away from me. 
 Come on. 
 Woman : Settle down. 
 [Children shouting playfully] 
 Hey, hey, hey, guys. Come on, yeah. 
 My... my grandson Jagger needs immediate medical attention. He's right here. 
 Clearly, he's on his deathbed. 
 Mom, I told you, we don't need to be at the hospital. 
 Well, the other parents agreed with me. 
 Because you freaked them out over simple colds. 
 And poison oak. 
 Woman : This is not a playground. 
 Uh, Dr. Kean, what do we have here? 
 A group of campers. 
 Actually, we were glamping. 
 Uh, what's glamping? 
 It's "glamorous camping." 
 It's all the benefits of nature without having to actually sleep on the ground. 
 Yeah, real camp is too rough for these kids. 
 Mom, I told you. I have calamine lotion at home. 
 Yeah, she made it out of witch hazel and fruit. 
 My mother would rather pump them full of pharmaceuticals. 
 Okay. Let's, uh, let's get 'em to the overflow room and out of the way. 
 Okay. Guys. 
 Now. 
 Noa : Guys, follow me. Follow me. 
 Come on, kids. This way. 
 [Helicopter blades whirring] 
 Will : Let's move. 
 We got two search and rescue workers coming in. 
 Injuries unknown. 
 Ethan : Floods? Earthquakes? Landslides? L.A. is uninhabitable. 
 Keeps us in business. 
 30-year-old male, pinned under debris. Multiple crush injuries. 
 B.P. dropped en route to 92 systolic. 
 30-year-old female, unconscious, found face-down in the mud. 
 On my count. One, two, three. 
 Man : Tachypneic on scene but improved with suctioning. 
 Now sat-ing in the low 90s. 
 Okay, let's move. 
 Jesse : We got him. We got him. 
 We can't examine them through all this mud. 
 Decon, Dr. Pineda. I assume you have one of those. 
 Leanne : Yeah, mama, you show him the way. 
 This one straight to center stage. 
 [Beeping] 
 Go. 
 [Monitor beeping erratically] 
 Head is a-traumatic. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. 
 Hips and pelvis are stable, but she's guarding. 
 Can I get an ultrasound? 
 Minimal rhonchi bilaterally with significant stridor. 
 I think there's debris from the mud caught in her throat. 
 I'll do a crike. 
 Laryngoscope and Magill forceps, please. 
 Laryngoscope. Now. 
 Crike's faster. 
 It's also more dangerous, Dr. Campbell. 
 I need to talk to Liz! 
 Okay, we're working on her. 
 What's your name, sir? 
 I have to see her. 
 Dr. Savetti, trauma survey. C-spine is non-tender. 
 No deformities noted to chest or abdomen. 
 Chest sounds are good bilaterally. Upper left extremity looks good. 
 Right is... whoa! 
 Oh. 
 Torn ulnar artery. The mud must have staunched the bleeding. 
 Hold pressure. 
 Let's get him inside. 
 Let's go. Go! 
 Uh... 
 [Children laughing and screaming] 
 Elliot, keep them in the room! 
 In the room! 
 You kids need to calm down! 
 [Screaming] 
 Please use your indoor energy! 
 How much longer is this gonna take? 
 Uh, we're going as fast as we can, ma'am. Trust me. 
 Go ahead. 
 I'm Natalie Drake. My son Jagger's 8. 
 Woman : Put that down! 
 These kids should've gone to a real camp. 
 You know, that would've told them which plants to avoid. 
 Mom, Jagger has one mother, and that's me. 
 And I've had some parenting experience, too. 
 Woman : Would you please stop doing that? 
 And look at this. Now I've got it. 
 Oh, so maybe it's not my parenting that caused it, for once. 
 On the "x." 
 Are you, um... How are you? 
 Being distracted helps. 
 Man : Come on son. I'm gonna help you out. 
 Mommy, I don't feel so good. 
 Woman : Kids, this is not a playground. Come here. 
 Yeah, he does feel feverish. Um, I'll get him an ibuprofen. 
 No, don't give him any medication until I've had a chance to call the pediatrician. 
 Natalie, this guy is a doctor. 
 Mom... 
 Oh. 
 Are you feeling okay? 
 [Gasps] Mom? Mom! 
 I need that gurney. 
 Liz! You okay? 
 Ethan : You gotta calm down. 
 Liz! 
 Okay, you gotta relax. 
 Liz! 
 Heart sounds distant. I hear a rub. 
 Neck veins are distended. B.P.'s down to 72 systolic. 
 [Monitor beeping erratically, indistinct conversations] 
 Okay, make sure he's typed and crossed for four. 
 Liz! Are you okay? 
 [Wheezing] 
 Okay, I'm close. 
 There's a splenic lac. 
 She'll need a C.T. scan when she's ready. 
 Okay, wait, wait, wait. I got it, I got it, I got it. 
 I got it. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 Okay, deep breaths. Malaya, can I get some suction, please? 
 And a give more oxygen, too. 
 S.T. elevation. This is an M.I. 
 Let me see. 
 The S.T. elevations are diffused. 
 This isn't a heart attack. 
 This is pericarditis. 
 That explains the heart rub. 
 What is this rash? 
 It's poison oak. 
 Tongue depressor. 
 That's poison oak. 
 Will : Dr. Dixon, take a look in here. 
 Tell me what you see. 
 Koplik spots. 
 Measles. 
 Correct, and you just exposed our most critical patients to it. 
 Leighton, get her isolated now. 
 Go, go, go, go! 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Liz. Liz, thank God you're okay. 
 Son of a bitch! 
 [Monitor beeping erratically] 
 What? 
 You killed Drew! 
 Calm down. Calm down. 
 [Crying] He killed my boyfriend. 
 [Crying] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 I moved all the drunks to overflow, but now it's... overflowing. 
 Well, we're just gonna have to start stacking 'em up in the hallway. 
 We're expecting more incoming from that mudslide. 
 We're gonna need all the space we can get. 
 Oh! 
 Excuse me. 
 Excuse me. [Groans] 
 Hey, hey. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. 
 Chair! 
 Dr. Pineda, get that chair. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 [Breathing shallowly] 
 B.P.'s tanking. She's tachy. 
 Her heart's barely beating. 
 The pericardium's full of fluid. You ready with that lido? 
 She has a huge pericardial effusion. We're doing a pericardiocentesis. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Okay, Dr. Dixon, let's get this fluid from her heart. 
 Spinal needle. 
 All right. 
 Here we go. 
 Hold steady for me. 
 And there we are. 
 Grab the transducer. 
 Slowly... 
 There we go. 
 You're doing great. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Welcome back, Joanna. 
 B.P.'s coming back up. 
 Thank you, Dr. Leighton. You're excused. 
 Dr. Dixon will take care of it from here. 
 Stethoscope. 
 Woman : The monitors are down. 
 I called up a rush C.T. 
 You and everyone else. 
 That mudslide brought half of Malibu in. 
 Brian : Come on. 
 [Groans] 
 Liz. Liz? Hey! 
 You have to believe me. 
 You were on that ledge, Other side. and the ground just gave away. 
 I-I... I tried to hold you both. 
 Can we get out of here? 
 I-I saved who I could save! 
 Hey, easy, bro. 
 No, no, no, why would I let him go? 
 Okay, come on, come on. Let's go. 
 That's crazy. That's crazy. 
 Okay, okay. 
 We gotta get moving here, guys. 
 Drew is my best friend! 
 All right. 
 You liar! 
 No! 
 Liar. 
 He's my best friend! 
 [Groaning] 
 I... I didn't kill Drew. 
 Nobody thinks you did. 
 Colonel Willis, his labs. 
 Thanks. 
 You heard Liz, didn't you? 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 I was holding 'em both. 
 And the mud it... it was pulling at him. 
 I-I couldn't... I couldn't save 'em both. 
 She thinks I let him die. 
 Why would she think that? 
 Did  you let him die? 
 No! 
 She called you Colonel. You're... you're military? 
 Afghanistan. Three tours. 
 National Guard since I was 20. 
 Your C.K. levels are off the charts. 
 Tells me you have severe muscle breakdown. 
 So you understand. Y-you've lost people, right? 
 The proteins released can clog the kidneys and shut 'em down. 
 It's called rhabdomyolysis, rhabdo for short. 
 My kidneys. 
 An aggressive course of hydration should solve it. 
 Bolus him saline, 30cc's per kilogram, then 250cc's per hour. 
 You see what I'm saying, though, right? 
 You've watched friends die that you wish you could've saved. 
 Right? 
 I-I tried to save him, man. 
 I really did. I-I tried. 
 Try to relax. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Hey, Liz. 
 We'd like you keep you overnight and monitor you, and then have someone come in every two hours and re-examine your abdomen, make sure you're okay. 
 Is it tender? 
 I'm being crazy, right? 
 You've had a rough day. 
 We see this stuff all the time as rescue workers. 
 We come in when a situation is at peak hell. 
 I can understand that. 
 I am being crazy. 
 It's just... 
 I know Rick. 
 I know how he feels about me. And he tried to hide it. 
 Drew and I were getting married. 
 I was even gonna take his crazy name... 
 McAdoo. 
 Drew McAdoo? 
 It's ridiculous, right? 
 [Crying] But I love him... loved him. 
 [Sniffles] Oh, God. 
 I saw him swept away. 
 One second he was there, and then... [Inhales deeply] 
 Liz... listen. 
 I don't know you and I don't know Rick, but I do know from seeing a lot of people in peak hell, that sometimes we just look for someone to blame, someone to be angry with. 
 Because otherwise... it's just loss. 
 Okay. 
 I went to pick up my passenger. 
 And out of nowhere, this guy just stopped short in front of me. 
 And I hit my head on an airbag. 
 You're a cab driver? 
 Oh, yeah. 36 years now. 
 Living the dream. 
 It sounds like a great job. 
 It was, till some kid almost ruined me. 
 Lawsuit? 
 Uber. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You, uh, you say you didn't see the driver in front of you? 
 No, I didn't see him. I... well, I guess I saw him too late and... yeah. 
 Uh, when I saw him, he was a little blurry. 
 Okay. All right. 
 I'm gonna order a head C.T. to check on that nose and to rule out any brain injury. 
 And I'll get an ophthalmologist to take a look at your eyes while you wait. 
 Thank you, Doc. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] 
 [Pen clicks] 
 Um... as a matter of fact, why don't you just write the order? 
 I'll go talk with Jesse to make sure we get the patients moving. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 Somebody get this off of my neck, will ya? 
 Oh, I... 
 There he is! Dr. Junior. 
 Man : 50-year-old male with ground level fall. 
 Found altered, slurring, but responds to pain. 
 Smells like E.T.O.H. 
 Yeah, of course he does. 
 Lacerations to extremities. 
 All right, we'll take it from here. Let's get him to sides. 
 It's been a long time. Did you miss me? 
 You're gonna need to leave that collar alone. 
 Oh, so stern. 
 You need to learn to lighten up. 
 I never raised you to be such a downer. 
 You know this guy? 
 No. He's my father. 
 Ow. 
 Dr. Savetti. 
 Should we get another attending to treat him this time? 
 Rules about treating family members? 
 Don't worry about it, sweetheart. 
 He doesn't think of me as family. 
 Ow! Damn it. 
 Let's get some pain meds goings, huh, Doc? 
 A milligram of Dilaudid? 
 Oh, I like this girl. 
 Hey, you busy later? 
 Hey, her name is Dr. Kean. And shut up. 
 Alcohol's got him numb enough. 
 You sound like your mother. 
 I'm surprised you remember her. 
 [Loudly] How could I forget? 
 So how'd you hurt yourself, Vince? 
 It's a long story. 
 It's always the same. 
 He either fell down or got beat up. Which one is it this time, Dad? 
 I forgot to pay my bill in the liquor store, so I ran out and fell down. 
 Yep. 
 On a hill. [Chuckles] 
 The bottles broke my fall, I guess. 
 You did this stealing a six-pack? That's great. 
 What am I, 12? 
 No. It was Kentucky Brown. 
 [Whispers] The good stuff. 
 [Inhales sharply] And I wouldn't be in this situation had he given me the money I requested before. 
 Mm-hmm. Sure. Blame me. Whatever helps. 
 I could really use that bourbon. 
 I could really, really,  really  use that bourbon. 
 Mario, look. 
 He's got a 5, maybe 6 centimeter lac back here. 
 Must've been covered by his hat. 
 Hey, call radiology. We're gonna need a C.T. right away. 
 Could have a brain bleed. 
 Get your hands off me. 
 You  can touch me all you want. 
 Are you saying my mother getting the measles is  my  fault? 
 It's called "herd immunity". 
 If everyone is vaccinated, then, uh, people like your mom are protected. 
 But if enough people decide not to vaccinate... 
 If you're in the immune herd, why are you wearing these gowns? 
 So that we don't take this out of here. 
 But she had the vaccine. I just don't understand. 
 Vaccines wear off over time. 
 Which is why your mom is susceptible. 
 [Children shouting playfully] 
 Hey, Doc. 
 Well... [sighs] there goes my modeling career. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, I wouldn't go breaking hearts just yet. 
 The, uh, C.T. scan shows a nasal fracture, but it's not displaced, so it'll heal. 
 And, Doc... you know I can tell what kind of day my passengers are having soon as they hop in my cab. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 One look into their eyes in the rear-view mirror, that tells a story. 
 That's quite a talent. 
 You, uh... you wanna know what I see when I look in your eyes? 
 You're not having such a good day. 
 And, uh... 
 I'm guessing it's because... you're gonna tell me I won't have my talent much longer. 
 You knew. 
 Yeah. 
 I thought, um, if I ignored the diagnosis... 
 I could pretend that it wasn't real. 
 Well... 
 It looks like macular degeneration. 
 Oscar... loss of vision is a harsh reality to face. 
 It's okay if you're afraid. 
 I'm not afraid of going blind. 
 Um... I'm afraid of having my license revoked. 
 Well, there are other jobs you can do, right? 
 [Sighs] Well... I guess it's hard for a doctor to understand, but... uh... driving is everything to me. 
 I got no life, I-I got no kids, but I have my passengers. 
 And, um... [Crying] they make my life... they make my life complete. 
 I understand, Oscar. 
 I really do. 
 It's okay. 
 You never heard of the cockroach theory in med school? 
 Must've skipped that lecture. Enlighten me. 
 Well, you know the hospital is filled with good people who are sick and dying, right? 
 Then there are those who come in here with no regard for life... drunks, criminals, sociopaths, you name it. 
 Somehow, they always leave unscathed. 
 Your dad's a cockroach? 
 
 
 
 You're slightly hypertensive. 
 Are you having any abdominal pain? 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Liz? 
 Liz? 
 What happened? 
 I don't know. She was just talking, and then she became unresponsive. 
 Her laceration must've distended. Ultrasound, please. 
 B.P.'s 43 over 20. 
 [Groans] 
 The pain okay? 
 I need to get to Liz. 
 I'll go check. 
 I can't lose her, man. 
 Her spleen ruptured. 
 Jesse : You want me to call the O.R.? 
 Yeah, tell Campbell we need him down here yesterday. 
 Yeah. She's bleeding to death internally. 
 We gotta get that spleen out now. 
 Center stage? 
 Uh, yeah, center stage. Now, people. 
 Campbell will be down in five. 
 We'll be elbow deep into this woman's abdomen by then. 
 Tube is in. 
 I've got color change. 
 First unit running in. 
 All right, peritoneum open. 
 I need a better view. 
 Place a Richardson and just pull that abdominal wall up. 
 Leanne : Hand me that lap pad, please. 
 Are you removing a spleen in the E.R.? 
 Yeah, we thought her dying in the elevator wasn't the best way to go. 
 No, you wanted play cowboy down here. 
 Okay, guys, how about we save her life now and argue later? 
 Let me get in there. 
 Okay, I've got my finger on the splenic hilum. 
 G.I.A. stapler, please. 
 I got it. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 All right, can I have light, please? 
 Yep, okay. Bleeding has stopped. 
 Jesse : B.P.'s coming back up. 
 My work here... is done. [Gloves snap] 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] 
 Whoa, don't go so soon. 
 I got my dinner here. 
 Share my crackers. 
 I don't like crackers. 
 So what do you like? We'll order it up. 
 Hey, garçon, may I see a menu? 
 [Sighs] Sorry. 
 Why you giving her such a hard time, huh? 
 I'm trying to get her to go out with me. 
 What? Too subtle? 
 C.T. results are back. 
 Yeah. 
 How's my head? 
 All clear. 
 Like a damn cat, baby. 
 10 lives. 
 Nine. 
 Whatever. [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Was there something else? 
 You're unreal. 
 Here. [Sighs] Take this. 
 What's that? 
 What do you think? 
 Thought you weren't gonna give me any money. 
 Yeah, I changed my mind. 
 What's the catch? 
 Just... take it. 
 [Whistles] 
 Yeah, well, enjoy it. 
 Hey. What's the rush? 
 Let's grab dinner. I got some cash now. 
 You wanted the money, now you have it. 
 I'd like to think you'd use it to get sober, but I know better. 
 Either way, Dad, I'm done. 
 I asked a nurse about an hour ago to give me some answers. 
 She said she would. Nobody's shown up. 
 Your mother's stable, okay? 
 And we're gonna recheck an echo in an hour. 
 But she's fine? 
 We'll... we'll know more in an hour, okay? 
 I still just... I don't understand how this happened. 
 I mean, I was just trying not to poison my kids. 
 And I did... 
 How much research did I do? I did a lot of research. 
 I was in chat rooms. 
 In chat rooms? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Listen, there's not a single actual study that links vaccines to any of the... the dark fantasies that you people have about them. 
 Natalie : What? 
 But the diseases they prevent are very real and dangerous, so dangerous that your mother is now fighting for her life. 
 I don't understand... 
 Dr. Dixon, that's enough. Take a walk, please. 
 Dr. Leighton, outside now. 
 Me? 
 Leanne : Now. 
 [Children shouting playfully] 
 [Radio chatter] 
 You're a senior resident. 
 So why are you mad at me? I didn't say anything. 
 No, but you were standing silently next to a first-year who did. 
 So how am I responsible? 
 One of the primary jobs of a second-year is to help train the first-years. 
 Teaching them is teaching yourself. 
 Okay, so I hope you don't mind me saying, I think she is an irresponsible parent. 
 I don't think he's wrong. 
 Medically, of course he's not wrong, but she doesn't need a lecture right now. 
 Her son is sick. Her mother is sicker. 
 What she needs right now is our compassion. 
 And let me tell you something about being a parent. 
 It's a minefield, only you're not the one walking in it, your child is. 
 You're just standing there on the sidelines, telling them where to step to hopefully avoid a disaster, often with nothing more than a best guess. 
 You should understand that more than anyone. 
 Angus, you're in your own minefield right now. 
 That's why your head's with Mike and not here. 
 And I'm sympathetic, but it needs to stop right now. 
 Understood? 
 I got you this, Dr. Guthrie. 
 For your low blood sugar. 
 [Telephone ringing in distance] 
 Is Oscar Terzian your patient? 
 Yes, of course. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And do you care about your patients? 
 What's wrong? Is he okay? 
 No, he is not okay. 
 I had to go and tell that man that he's going blind, and you were nowhere to be found. 
 I-I'm sorry. I... my patient from the mudslide... 
 Oscar Terzian is your patient, too! 
 You need to learn how to budget your time, Dr. Pineda. 
 Looks like your kidneys are coming around. 
 Liz is still in surgery. 
 She's doing fine. Thought you'd wanna know. 
 I just wish I could remember how it happened. 
 We're back on this again? 
 One minute, I'm holding him, and the next he was gone. 
 You know, it's just... he was heavy. His watch... 
 Let's talk about your dialysis. 
 We have doctor/patient privilege, right? 
 It's attorney/client privilege. 
 I lied before. 
 I do love her. 
 I think about her all the... 
 Stop talking. 
 Call that lawyer. 
 I don't need to call a lawyer. 
 I didn't kill him. He was my best friend. 
 What if I did it subconsciously? 
 What if this conversation happened subconsciously? 
 Colonel... 
 I'm not a murderer. 
 Okay. 
 Let's leave it on that happy note. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Elliot : What happened? 
 I came in to draw labs and she lost consciousness. 
 She have a pulse with that? 
 Yes, but thready. 
 Blood pressure's cratering. 
 I don't get it. 
 [Sighs] 
 What is going on? 
 What do you wanna do, Dr. Dixon? 
 Doctor? 
 How long's she been in that rhythm? 
 I-I don't know. I just got here. 
 Okay, Risa, increase the oxygen. 
 You see those P-waves? 
 It's a total disassociation from ventricular contractions. 
 It's a third-degree heart block. 
 Measles. 
 That virus must've damaged the muscles of her heart. 
 Is it myocarditis? 
 Bingo. 
 We're gonna need to place an emergency pacemaker. 
 Risa, call supply. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 We found him in v-fib. 
 Shocked him twice. He went into asystole. 
 He's had five rounds of epi. 
 Another epi in. 
 [Monitor beeping erratically] 
 [Monitor emits continuous tone] 
 It's Vince. 
 [Monitor beeping erratically, compressions resume] 
 [Siren wails] 
 Hey. 
 Why do people want to talk to me about things? 
 I'm not that guy. 
 You could be that guy. 
 I don't wanna be that guy. 
 I wanna be the guy that goes to work and comes home, never learns anything personal about anybody ever. 
 Well, methinks thou doth protest too much. 
 I saw you with Rick. Face it. You care. 
 Woman : Got another one from the mudslide! 
 What's your name, sir? 
 Drew. Drew McAdoo. 
 You're Drew McAdoo? 
 Uh, straight to center stage, please. He's alive. 
 Apparently so. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Gurney clacks] 
 [Indistinct conversations continue] 
 He's hemorrhaging around the branch. I'll ultrasound the abdomen. 
 Hang two units. 
 [Rapid beeping continues] 
 [Indistinct conversations continue] 
 What do you wanna do? 
 Noa : [Distorted voice] What do you wanna do? 
 He's been down for 40 minutes. 
 Mario. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 I wanna call it. 
 I can try to... 
 It's over. 
 Call it. 
 [Compressions continue] 
 [Rapid beeping continues] 
 [Monitor emits continuous tone] 
 Time of death... 
 6:32 P.M. 
 [Switch clicks, tone stops] 
 Good job, Dr. Kean. 
 You did the best you could. 
 I got it. 
 [Gurney wheels clack] 
 Set up a suture tray. Hold pressure. 
 That was Mario's father. 
 [Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.] 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Hang in there, okay? 
 It hurts. 
 We're gonna have to pull the branch out to stop the bleeding. 
 Yeah, agreed. 
 I'll pull, you suture. 
 Got it. 
 I'll need a hemostat with a loaded suture, please. 
 Wait. I got suction. 
 On three. One, two... three. 
 Leanne : Yeah. 
 [Groans] 
 Go. 
 [Groaning] 
 Oh! 
 [Suction gurgling] 
 Take this up to Pathology. 
 It's through the soft tissue, not the abdomen. 
 [Chuckles] Lucky guy. 
 Let's get a C.T., a quick one. 
 A lot of people waiting to see you. 
 Ow. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 And what's your placement? 
 Just past 20 centimeters. 
 Yeah. Now inflate your balloon. 
 I-I  really  think that you should take over. 
 She's your patient, Dr. Dixon. 
 This is how we learn emergency medicine... in the middle of emergencies. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 That's it. 
 Now plug the lead into the pace generator. 
 Like... like this? 
 [Click] 
 That's perfect. 
 [Beep, monitor beeping steadily] 
 Look at that screen. 
 It's capturing. 
 She has a pulse. 
 That's good work, Doctor. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 I saw what happened with Dr. Guthrie. 
 He was right. I wasn't where I should've been. 
 And the hand tremors? 
 What hand tremors? 
 You think your mama's blind? 
 No, I just don't know what you're talking about. 
 Don't ask him about it. 
 Let him come to you. 
 What if he doesn't? 
 He will, when he's ready. 
 Hey. 
 Look what I found. 
 [Curtain rings whoosh] 
 [Telephone ringing in distance] 
 Drew? 
 Drew! [Breathing heavily] 
 He slid through 2 miles of mud to see you. 
 Hey! 
 That's a hell of a way to score room service, man. 
 I saw you get washed away. 
 Man, I thought you were... 
 I'm all right. I'm good. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 I'm okay. 
 Thank you, Rick. 
 You saved her. She's gonna be okay. 
 Yeah, but... 
 You saved Liz. 
 [Voice breaks] I let you go, bro. 
 I-I let you go. 
 Is that what you think? 
 That you let  me  go? 
 [Chuckles] No, man. 
 I let  you  go. 
 I pulled my hand away so that you could save Liz. 
 What? 
 She means everything to me, man. 
 I know. 
 Thank you. 
 [Crying] 
 I love you. 
 [Laughs] 
 How hard is it to replace the coffee after... 
 [object thuds, clatter] 
 I'd rather do it myself. That's fine. 
 You okay? 
 Just trying to get a cup of coffee. 
 I keep a secret stash of Kenyan pea-berry in my locker if you want some. 
 I'm okay. I'm just gonna make my own. 
 I'm... really sorry about your dad. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, this isn't your fault. 
 I know. Believe me, he's been killing himself for years. 
 She's still groggy from the anesthesia, but she's doing well. 
 There are strict rules to living with a pacemaker. 
 Um, no metal detectors, no microwave... 
 I know. I've done my own research online. 
 [Chuckles] Kidding. 
 Um, by the way, I called a new pediatrician, and my kids are getting vaccines next week. 
 Ah, well, I'm glad to hear it. 
 Natalie. Honey. 
 Mom? 
 Honey, oh. 
 [Sniffles] Hi. 
 Mom, I'm so sorry. 
 Oh, honey. 
 It's my fault. 
 I love you. 
 Even after what I did? 
 I'm your mother. I love you no matter what stupid mistakes you make. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I love you, too. 
 You did good work back there. 
 You, too. 
 Should we, like, high-five or hug or something? 
 No. 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 So what's going on with the shaking hands? 
 Excuse me? 
 Look, if there's something you wanna talk to us about... 
 I don't. 
 Unless you got a good alternative to caffeine. 
 You mean low blood sugar, right? 
 Maybe a little bit of both. 
 What happened to letting him bring it up? 
 He was taking too long. 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 Dr. Campbell, um... 
 I wanna apologize. 
 It's been a tough couple months for me, but I want you to know, that I'm... 
 I came to tell you about Mike. 
 There was some increased activity on his most recent E.E.G. 
 Yeah, that c-could be an artifact. 
 Or it could be a really good sign. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] 
 Liz. 
 Liz. 
 I'm here. [Sniffles] 
 I'm right here. 
 [Lowered voice] I guess I should just forget all the stuff you told me earlier. 
 [Sighs] 
 You show up just to die right in front of me. 
 You know, you could've disappeared. 
 Never would've known. 
 [Sighs heavily] 
 Did you come here on purpose? 
 Did you know? 
 [Exhales] 
 You were right here. 
 You were finally here. 
 Hey. [Clears throat] 
 I'm okay. Yeah. 
 I said I'm okay. Jeez. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Come here. 
 Hey, look, man, I'm all right, okay? 
 Come here. 
 I'm serious. 
 Come here. 
 [Voice breaks] I'm okay. 
 I know. 
 [Breathes shakily] 
 I know. 
 [Muffled voice] I'm okay. 
 I am so, so sorry. 
 [Sobbing] I'm okay. 
 I'm okay. 
 I'm okay. I'm okay. 
 I'm okay. 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 You still here? 
 You know, I'm starting to get the feeling you wanna get rid of me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yeah, yeah, calling your bluff. 
 Thought you might like a cold one. 
 Thank you. 
 You know, just because I wanna go back doesn't mean they're gonna take me. 
 What the hell did you do over there to deserve this place? 
 This place... is considered the best E.R. in the world. 
 It's an honor to be here. 
 You know why they call me "mama"? 
 'Cause I'm the caretaker. 
 I take care of my own. 
 And now you're one of my own, like it or not. 
 In Afghanistan... "War calls forth all that is noble and honorable in a man. It unites him with his brothers and binds them in selfless love." 
 That's beautiful. 
 It's not mine. It's from a novel Steven Pressfield wrote about Sparta. 
 But I like it. 
 I left a lot of good men and women there. 
 I just wanna go back to 'em. 
 We got brothers and sisters... and all kinds of selfless love here. 
 It's not every day we lose a soldier on the field, but we just did. 
 We could use someone who knows how to get through it. 
 I knew it. 
 You're attached. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 I didn't say that. 
 You know what? 
 Maybe I will stick around, just to piss off Campbell. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'll drink to that. 
 [Bottles clink]
