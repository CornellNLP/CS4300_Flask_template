 Previously on "Code Black"... 
 Two months' suspended vacation with pay. This is absurd. Grace. Neal. Christa : So, who's Grace? She's a doctor who used to work here. I'm asking who she is to  you. I talked to harbert about the nurses. And? It's just not doable right now. You can't tell anyone. Don't pull that knife! You and I take this to our graves. [Gagging] Help me. What's this? Adderall. It'll focus you in. Woman : Welcome to tonight's presidential primary debate between candidates Senator Darren Stringer and Governor Hank Wesley. [Applause] The first question goes to Senator Stringer. Senator, you've been very critical of the Governor's military service. [Siren wails, indistinct radio chatter] Hey, uh, I can't really, um... I can't really talk right now, but, um, I'm about to run out of those vitamins that you gave me. So, did you guys get to meet the candidates? Stringer seems like a real tool. You say you stood in the line of fire. Angus : No. They just breezed right by us. We are out here on the loading dock. Worst job ever. [Clears throat] So, are you going to give me those vitamins or what? Heather : Vitamins? Dude, I gave you like 50 three weeks ago. Okay, now I need like 50 more. [Sighs] I can't keep using Campbell's prescription pad. Look, I can get you like 10 more, but that's it. You really got to ease up on the stuff. Who are you talking to? [Sniffles, clears throat] How much longer we have to be at this debate? Chill, dude. Only a few more hours on standby. I am chill. [Laughs] You don't look it. 65 degrees out here, and you're sweating. What are you, a weatherman? Pupils are dilated. I bet you if I checked your heart rate, you'd be over 100. Why don't you save your diagnosing for the hospital? Fine. Plain English, you're acting like a dick. Hmm. And you have B.O. What are you popping... Moda, Rids, Adderall? That's the thing about drug addicts... They see kindred spirits where they don't exist. ♪ Your campaign has covered up  your military record since day one. He's blackmailing us. He said this would happen, and Jesse always does what he says. Isn't he supposed to be your friend? He is my friend. Treat him with respect. He's earned it. Trust me, okay? Jesse. How do we stop the strike before it starts? You know what you need to do. Pay increase, guaranteed overtime, more nurses. When the board meets in two months, I will... Two months? That's five of us walking out tonight. Tomorrow, it'll be six. I don't negotiate like this, so let me tell you how this is gonna go. No, no, no. I'm gonna tell  you how this is gonna go. I'm not stepping one foot into Trauma One unless you start... Okay. Let's all just calm down. [Indistinct radio chatter] Mario : I'm not trying to hassle you. I'm just trying to be a friend. If you were actually my friend, you'd drop it, okay? Just... Oh, my God. [ People screaming ] [ Explosion ] Was that an explosion? What? Wow. All right, listen up. Gonna have incoming. Nurses on me. Go! [Alarm ringing, indistinct radio chatter] Sir, are you okay? Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm okay, I'm okay. Hey, what's going on? Explosion inside. The ceiling collapsed. We got to get inside. I've got Senator Stringer's wife and daughter right behind me. You're gonna need a gurney. I've got Skylark. Flamingo's on my 6:00. [Tires screech] Get her in the car! Everyone out of the building! Secure the perimeter! Let's go. Get her out of here. Come on. Skylark in the lead vehicle. Move, move, move, move! Get Mrs. Stringer in the ambulance now! It's Darren. Let's move it out! I will be on the bus to Flamingo. [Siren wailing] Secure the outer perimeter! I got to get an airway. Let's go. Move, move. Who are they?! Countersniper units. Snipers?! Are you expecting another attack?! Man : We don't know what to expect. Senator Darren Stringer, pulse 140, pressure 80/60, blast wounds to the chest and abdomen. Easy, now. Senator, do you know what day it is? Anne, Caroline... What happened to them? Center Stage, please. Tube, please. Got it. I'll bag him up. Excuse me. These patients need to be moved out of the way for the candidates. He's not ready to be moved. Neal : I got the back. Wait. Let's line him up, start fluids running, please. I got 18-gauge, and I'm about to run another one. Sats down to 60 and reduced breath sounds on the left. He's gonna need a... Chest tube. I'm on it. Move. Dr. Rorish, I need Senator Stringer moved to a secure area. It's not gonna happen. I'm not asking. None of these patients are moving anywhere until they've been stabilized. Got it? Dr. Harbert, we briefed you. I'm not in charge here. If Dr. Rorish says they stay, they stay. Please, I just want to know if my family's all right. [Sirens wailing] [Indistinct radio chatter] Man : Copy, Flamingo is on board. We're inbound to Angels Base. How far out are we? There's no pulse. Starting compressions. What the hell are you doing? Angus, stop. [Gasps] Angus, stop! What the hell are you doing?! What did he do? Nothing. What do you mean Skylark is down? You really think she needs CPR? She has an H-VAD. Is she responding to your commands? She has a ventricular pump. Yes! She's not in cardiac arrest. Did you not read the secret service brief? Medical kit? I repeat, do you need a medical kit? People with H-VADs never have a pulse. I know. Copy. Five by five, Nema, Charlie. Stringer's daughter is in the follow vehicle. She's losing consciousness and coughing up blood. Hey! Pull the rig over! Copy. We're pulling over now. One of us has to get in that car. I'll go. Man on radio :  All vehicles, hold transit. Angus. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. ♪ [Indistinct radio chatter] [Horn honks] Commence transit. Ms. Stringer? Ms. Stringer, can you hear me? She was fine a minute ago, and then she just collapsed and started coughing up blood. There's something going on down here. Shrapnel to the chest. [Gurgling] How much further? [Indistinct radio chatter] [Sirens wailing] [Tires screeching] [Car doors closing] Ventricular-assist device. Blunt trauma to the head and chest. Heart rate's showing 95. Mrs. Stringer, I'm Dr. Guthrie. Can you open your eyes for me, please? Angus : Over here. Malaya, over here! [Coughs] Over here. 26-year-old female. 1...2...3! Shrapnel in her chest. Coughing up blood. Malaya, it's the senator's daughter. Woman :  Before the cameras went out, a portion of the ceiling can be seen falling on Governor Wesley and secret service protection. Senator Stringer and his family were brought to Angels Memorial Hospital. Free fluids. He's bleeding internally. Positive for a liver laceration. Got to get him upstairs. You're moving him? Jesse, take him to C.T., front of the line, and then page I.R. Follow him. Senator Stringer, we need to bring you upstairs now. What about my family? They're coming in right now. We've got them. [Indistinct radio chatter] All right, heads up, heads up. This is Anne Stringer, the senator's wife. Mind your backs, please. Man : We have the senator's daughter, Caroline Stringer. Breath sounds equal bilaterally. Good exchange. On my count. 1...2...3. [Groaning] Man : Thank you. No other wounds. She's regaining consciousness. [Coughing] Neal : Pineda, start a F.A.S.T. scan. Mom? Mom, are you okay? I'm right here, baby. Where's dad? Leanne : Normal RPMs. Your pump is functioning correctly. Where's my husband? He's in radiology. He is stable, but his condition is serious. Neal : Let's get a lung window over this chest wound. Dr. Leighton, take control of this bleeding, please. [Suction gurgling] Negative for pneumothorax. Good. Dr. Leighton, let's get these sutures going and get her up to the scanner. Mrs. Stringer, can you take in a big breath for me, please? Okay. Does it hurt if I press there? Yes. That's isolated sternal trauma. I doubt that that came from a blast injury. Dr. Savetti, what happened out there? Leighton, what happened out there? She was unconscious, had no pulse, so I started compressions. Was the H-VAD not functioning? Savetti, assist on that table, please. Leighton, outside now. You didn't see that she had an H-VAD? Well, I just... Hi. Do you mind? This is a private conversation. While you're taking care of my protectee, I have to document everything. This is my resident, not a terrorist. Is this relevant to Mrs. Stringer's care? No. So, what the hell were you thinking? She had no pulse, and my first reflex was CPR. And you didn't see the other signs of perfusion... Warm skin, good cap refill, the fact that she was still breathing? I get it. I messed up. Man : Dr. Rorish. Candidate Wesley and his wife are arriving now. 1...2...3. Okay. I have Mrs. Wesley. Governor Wesley is on the rig pulling in. Okay, thanks. Heads-up, guys. [Siren wailing] [Indistinct radio chatter] What do you got? Governor Wesley. 43-year-old male. Massive crush injuries to the neck down, and his stomach is distended. All right, tense abdomen. Center Stage now. Last B.P.? 70s over palp. Okay, let's move it. Okay, I want trauma, thoracic, vascular attendings bedside. 30 seconds, please. Is that him? Hank! Hank. Hank?! Mrs. Wesley... Risa : You need an airway. Sux and etomidate. Push it when we land. Dr. Lorenson, you manage the airways. I'll do the F.A.S.T. Jesse, suction, please. Got it. [Monitor beeping rapidly] Free fluid. Dr. Lorenson, you've got 10 seconds. I see cords. Tube, please. Bag. [Beeping slows] Woman : Surgery is here. Breath sounds equal bilaterally. Dr. Rorish, what's the story? Crush injury, GCS 3, in respiratory failure. Abdomen worrisome for ruptured abdominal aorta. Airway is secure? Yeah. All right, let's scoop and run. We're ready up there. Dr. Hudson, meet me in surgery as soon as you get the all-clear. Everybody ready? Let's move him up. [Pen light clicks] Oh, God, wait. I think I'm gonna throw up. It's okay. Just keep breathing. Okay. Okay. [Groans] Okay. Let me get four of Zofran and the ultrasound, please. I heard Hank grunting from the rubble. It sounded like he was fighting to breath. Just relax, Mrs. Wesley, okay? [Sighs] All right, let's get the fluid up and the trauma panel sent. He was dying, wasn't he? We're doing everything we can, okay? Okay? F.A.S.T. is negative. [Gasps] 'Cause I know what he sounds like when he can't breathe, 'cause he had pneumonia when we were in college, so I know what he sounds like when he's... Okay. Mrs. Wesley, I need you to listen to me. They are doing everything they can to save him. Okay. But we got to take care of you, too. Okay? Okay. Okay. Thank you. Can someone find out what happened to my phone? I have to get it back. The secret service aren't allowing phones inside. Yeah, I know. I'm also my dad's campaign manager, and [Inhales sharply] I have about 4,000 people trying to get ahold of me right now. Can you check on that for me? [TV chatter] Hey, uh, something's going on with Angus. He's, uh, probably just freaked out over this bomb thing. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. We're gonna do a C.T. scan, make sure you have no intracranial bleeding. Okay, wait. Please wait. Stop. I just need to know what's happening with my husband. Mrs. Wesley, it's important for you to stay calm, okay? Deep breaths. You know what? I was just in Haiti. Really? Yeah. Operation Hope, which I believe you founded, right? Yeah. Yeah. I spent a year there. It's a wonderful program. Occasionally, something good comes out of those Washington cocktail parties. Yeah. Okay. Has anyone taken responsibility for this yet? Is it ISIS? Man : Haven't heard anything yet, sir. We're all done here, senator. Is that Margaret? Margaret Wesley... Is she okay? Looks like they're taking her for a C.T. I'd like to see her, please. I need to go check on her first. Did you go to Haiti in a group or by yourself? My boyfriend and I signed up to go together, but... but, um, long story, he ended up not going. Still one of the best experiences of my life. [Door opens] Darren : Margaret. You okay? Senator Stringer, you can't be in here. Darren : How's Hank? Is he... He's being worked on downstairs. That's where Anne and Caroline are... Down in that Center Stage place. Look, I just wanted to say we need to stay strong through this. We need to stay strong for each other. Do you ever stop? Excuse me? There aren't any news cameras allowed up here, no one for you to play to. That's not fair. It's not fair. You and your daughter have dragged my husband's name through your filth and bile for the last six months, and you want to talk to me about faith. We used to be friends, Margaret. Remember? The four of us? I know you do, too. Senator, please, can you... can you please... Get out of here. Get out. Get out! You son of a bitch. [Sobs] [Indistinct radio chatter] Woman :  We join a press conference in progress at Angels Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles, where doctors treated... [Indistinct shouting] Senator Stringer is stable, along with his wife and his daughter. His care was overseen by Dr. Rorish and her staff. Woman : Is it true Governor Wesley was critically injured? Governor Wesley was also stabilized by our trauma team. He is in critical condition. He's in surgery. His wife, Mrs. Wesley, is still under observation. No further questions. Angus : Mrs. Stringer, your scans came back with significant rib and pelvis fractures. We're stopping your blood thinners, and I've ordered you painkillers every two hours. Is there anything else I can get for you? Yeah. What's the wi-fi password here? Honey, please. Could you stop working for a minute? Mom, the campaign hasn't stopped. If anything, we're in overdrive. What's keeping my dad? I need to get him in front of the cameras as soon as possible. He'll be back from radiology in a minute. Caroline, is that really what you're worried about right now? [Wheelchair rattles] Dad. Hey. There are my girls. Oh, thank God you're okay. Annie, how are you doing? We need to get you out there. Do you need this wheelchair? Um, I'm worried about the optics. Caroline, enough. People died, and you're worried about what he looks like on camera. This is public life, mom, okay? Obama, Sandy Hook. George W., 9/11. He needs to look presidential right now. This is how you lead. Don't lecture me, young lady. Hank and Margaret Wesley are our friends. I haven't heard either one of you ask about them even once. They haven't been your friends in a long time. And whose fault is that? I think we need a stronger opening. I think what we do is take this idea here and move it up to the top. It's good here, but we want to just combine these two ideas. I think it's gonna be really powerful. 
 
 ♪ [Sirens wailing] [Indistinct radio chatter] 37-year-old male. Crushing injuries, scalp wounds, and positive L.O.C. How long was he down for? 20 minutes. Secret service held us up because he didn't have proper I.D. I'll call C.T. Okay. On my count. Ready? 1...2...3. [Groans] Sir, what do you remember? Jose : I was cleaning the men's bathroom. There was a loud bang. And when I woke up, I was in the ambulance. Can you move your hands and legs for me? Yeah. Good. [Machine beeps] Sir, does any of this hurt? Only my head. We need to get him to C.T. I'll get the labs. Okay. Señor? Jose. Jose, I'm gonna need to take your necklace off. Metal will mess up the C.T. scan, okay? Please don't. It's from my kids. They each made part of it. But I need to take it off for the scan. I promise it's never gonna leave my hand. It's gonna be right here when you get back, okay? Palabra? Palabra, mi hermano. Palabra. [Speaks Spanish] Okay, C.T. is ready. Let's move out. Vamos. Okay, guys. Go. [Indistinct TV chatter] [Indistinct radio chatter] Hi. Grace : Hi. Your husband's been transferred to the O.R. He's with Dr. Campbell, our chief of surgery. Will you take me up there? No, no, no. You need to rest. We just got your scans back, and it shows blood in your brain. With these kinds of explosions, brain-bleed injuries are common. But how serious is it? I'm... Only time will tell. If it gets worse, you need surgery. But for the moment, we just wait and see, and we watch you very closely. When he decided he wanted to go into politics, he warned me about how bad it would get, but I didn't hesitate, not for a second. Have you ever felt that way? Just... just feel certain of someone. You know? I don't think so. Is it that one that almost went with you to Haiti? Hmm? Yeah. Yeah. Me and my husband were married there. We did our vows in Creole. Ou se souf lavi mwen. "You are the breath of my life." [Voice breaking] Yes. Yes. Yes. [Inhales sharply] Yes. Man : I'll be right back. How'd you miss the H-VAD in Mrs. Stringer's file? Ask Rorish. Mario : She tear you a new one? She spanked me, and I took it. Not a big deal. That's the problem with that junk you're taking. Nothing's a big deal. All right. This is the last time I'm gonna say this to you. Hey, guys. What's going on? Nothing. It's over. Is this about the H-VAD? Oh, is that what everybody's talking about... How idiot Angus almost killed Anne Stringer? No one thinks you almost killed her. Wouldn't matter if I did. What's that supposed to mean? Did what? If I killed someone. What would happen? Nothing. [Inhales sharply] There's bleeding in my head? Yes, but there's a chance it could stop on its own. Right now, all we can do is wait. [Indistinct radio chatter] Don't worry. They've assured us that we're safe in here, okay? No, it's... I wanted to call my wife before, but they took my phone. No one's allowed to make outgoing calls. They even took my phone. I have to call her. She might think I'm not calling because they took me or something, por favor. I promise we're gonna get you home as soon as we can, okay? Gracias. Hey. Hey. I have a patient with a brain-stem injury. I'm hoping he won't need surgery. But when you get a chance... I'll come by. I'll take a look. Thanks. Is there something else? Why didn't you just tell me you were supposed to go to Haiti with Grace? 'Cause it doesn't matter. I didn't go. Why not? Christa, you don't have to be insecure about this. Don't. Please, don't... Don't do that. Do not cast me in the role as "needy girlfriend." I'm better than that, and you know it. Fair enough. I asked her to marry me. Oh. She said no. So she went to Haiti, and I stayed here, and that's... that's the whole truth. Thank you. I should get back in there. I'll see you later. ♪ [Siren wailing] [Monitor beeping] I need packing. Irrigation... right here. [Suction hissing] Note the enteric content. Can someone glove me up? What for? Scissors. I was told to come scrub in with you. You were told to come see me. More saline. Quick question... If you were me and found out that someone's been using your prescribing information without explicit permission... Would you inform the D.E.A.? Bovie. And again. [Sizzling] That will be all, Dr. Pinkney. Help her! Help her! Her pump alarm is going off! [Alarm beeping rapidly] What's going on? Is she breathing? [Beeping stops] What are you doing now? Tell me what's going on! Is she breathing? Is she gonna be okay? No cardiac motion. Dilated left ventricle. It's hot. It must have been pushing against the outflow thrombus. Tell us what's going on. Why aren't you doing anything? [Voice breaking] Dad, make them do something! Trauma from the explosion caused her to have a massive blood clot in her heart. I'm so sorry. There was nothing anyone could do. She's dead? Mario : Could happen to anyone with trauma, even with a normal heart. I'm so sorry, senator. She was just talking. Oh, God. I-I didn't even get to tell her... [Voice breaking] Mommy. [Sobbing] Mario : Is it true? News travels fast. You used Campbell's name to get narcotics? Please, Mario. It's not coke. It's just some Adderall. That's how Angus got it. You hooked him up. Now I'm a drug dealer. No, you're a drug buddy. Just as bad. Yeah, I'm his drug buddy. We actually chop it up, and then he snorts it off my ass. You think this is a joke? Hey, let go of me. I saw what drugs did to my parents, to me. I have been taking the stuff for years without any problem. If Angus can't handle it, that's not on me. What happens when Campbell goes to the board, huh, or the cops? You could lose your medical license and Angus'. I can handle Campbell. [Chuckles] You really came in the middle of the night. Well, I haven't been able to sleep at night since I left this place. So, I really like what you've done to the room. It's so cheery. It's a temp job, remember? Just until you come back. So, you said you have a problem? I do. Is it illegal? Ah. You really think you're gonna drag me off my boat to talk about the budget? I'd rather have root canal on my nuts. [Chuckles lightly] I need to find a few million dollars by sunrise. Is that all? It's for the nurses. It will carry them for the next three years. Hmm. So Jesse's breathing down your neck. It's not easy, is it? You know, I told you, you can't have friends in this job, much less a 200-pound Puerto Rican bruiser named Mama. Well, that bruiser's about to go on strike. Are you gonna help me or not? If you really want to do this, you got to get good at politics. You ready for that? After what I've seen tonight, I'm not so sure. For starters, wrong budget. That is the E.R. budget. The overall budget. It's not enough to know how much you have. You got to know... What everybody else has. That's politics. Hmm. [Metal detector beeps] [Indistinct radio chatter] Dr. Leighton, you got a sec? What is it, Savetti? [Sighs] You've noticed Angus has been acting strange, a little different. What's going on? He thinks he's got it under control. He doesn't. Mario, what are you talking about? He's abusing Adderall. I thought I was protecting him, but I was wrong. We have to help him before he really hurts himself. Or someone else. Yeah. [Monitor beeping rapidly] Grace : Losing an airway! [Margaret groaning] Help me with her head so she doesn't aspirate. Vomiting, uh, intermittent consciousness. Should we intubate? Page surgery. Her intracranial's at 40. She needs a craniotomy. Center Stage. Let's go. Dr. Lorenson, he started seizing! He has a brain bleed. Must have gotten worse. Cole : All right, protect his airway. Let's get ready to move. Angus : What happened? Risa, page Dr. Hudson. Tell him we have a brain-stem bleed. Come on, come on. Ready? Yeah. Go. Man : We've got a crush trauma in there, so... [Indistinct chatter] Leave! Watch out! Out of the way, out of the way! Coming through! Coming through. Man : Come on. Get in line. Dr. Leighton, take a break. What? No, I'm here to help. Take a break. Out of Center Stage now! Go! Neal : Someone call surgery? I did. I did. We need to page another surgeon. I'm all you've got. Was he posturing like this? Since he started seizing. 37 years old. C.T. scan shows a brain-stem bleed. He has to take the governor's wife. That's not your call. It's a medical decision. She needs to go to surgery. Doctors, was either patient anticoagulated? No. Neither was he. Deep parenchymal bleed. Declining mental status, vomiting. I'm in. Take a listen? Okay. Equal breath sounds bilaterally. You're wasting time. She's still reactive. And Jose's exam? Blown on the right, sluggish on the left. They're almost identical. You take her. Christa : He's herniating. Mrs. Wesley has the best shot. I'm taking her. Grace : Airway is all set. We'll send her with R.T. Good luck. Ladybug is on the move to surgery. Christa : Neal! Let's go, please. Pack her up. She only has a few minutes. Neal! Will : Suction. [Suction hissing] Suture. Woman : Pressure 70/50. Hang another bag. Wide-open, please. Sweat. Good timing, Dr. Hudson. I've got an eviscerated G.I. tract here. Get in here as quickly as you can. I have an emergent craniotomy waiting for me. I'm sorry. Is your emergent craniotomy as important as the life of the possible next leader of the free world? I don't think so. Cut it. It is to him. It's his wife. Good luck. Another suture. will : Packing. 3-0, please. Not in 10 seconds, now. I need another loaded 3-0 immediately. More packing. Suction. Governor Wesley's pressure's bottoming out. When the abdominal aorta ruptures, it's a very difficult repair. It's like turning off a water main. His chances are very slim. [ Suction hissing ] Neal :  Open, please. Gonna have to move faster. What's her status? Neal, secret service wants an update on Margaret Wesley. We've removed a portion of the skull and the protective layering of the brain. About to dissect down to the blood pocket below the brain surface and, um, hopefully suction it out. How is she doing? We'll know in just a few seconds. Will :  More packing. Need lats. Need more lats. Come on, come on, come on. More lats. Lats. Get them in there. Six more units of blood. Get ready for compressions. Man : We've hung 15 already. I know. [Flatline] Woman: Flatline. No pulse. Starting compressions. No, no, no, no. [Grunts] Give me one of epi, one of atropine. Is the governor gonna make it? [Monitors beeping rapidly] Will : Come on, come on, come on, come on. Pulse check? Woman : No pulse. He's losing too much blood. We can't infuse him fast enough. Hold that one steady, please. Little big higher. A few more millimeters to go. He's got it. ♪ Come on, governor, stay with me. Infiltrated the clot. [Suction hisses] And positive for blood return. Let's get her home. [ Sighs ] I'm sorry. Will :  He's gone. [Sighs] Time of death... 2:54 A.M. ♪ Mrs. Wesley, can you hear me okay? [Monitor beeping steadily] Neal : It's okay, Mrs. Wesley. We're doing everything we can to make you more comfortable. You've been through a very difficult surgery. Can I see my husband? Will : Mrs. Wesley, I fought as hard as I could, but your husband's injuries had progressed beyond what we could do for him. He didn't survive the surgery. I am so sorry. [Indistinct chatter] I need to talk to you. Yeah, I don't think you want to be telling me what you need. I think you should take me up to the disciplinary committee. What you did could put you in jail. I didn't know what else to do, Dr. Campbell. I was so traumatized. You were what? Would you take this up to records, please? I'm just a resident, and you're the Chief of Surgery. I was so scared, I didn't tell anyone. What the hell are you talking about? [Chuckles] That's a good one. Did I send these to you? Or should I just post it? What? I mean, who am I to say no to someone like you? Are you crazy? Dr. Pinkney. Heather. [Clears throat] [Door opens] [Groans] Senator, I really need you to sit. Did you hear? It wasn't a bomb. Gas leak. My wife, Hank Wesley, all those good people hurt because of a rusty valve. This doesn't make sense, does it? No, it doesn't. [Knock at door] You look great, dad. Fine. This is happening. I'll get a wheelchair. He can push you right up to the room with the cameras. After that, you should walk on your own. [Sighs] You should come out there with me. Mom would like that. [Voice breaking] We both know that's not true. [Sobs] [Sniffles] This just doesn't feel right. Mom just died. I know. But you're the one that said it, right? This is public life. I have to say something. We had a fight. I know. People argue. Don't do this to yourself. No, no. It wasn't... It wasn't the fight today. It was one last week. She said that... that you got into politics because you wanted to change the world and that I got into politics because I wanted to win. Everybody wants to win. Don't go out there. Why? Because she was right. There's something we need to do first. Can... can you take us upstairs? You bet. [Door opens] [Door closes] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Margaret, and I'm sorry for everything I did, every ugly word I said about Hank. I don't know how, but... I promise you I'm gonna make it right. [Indistinct radio chatter] He was a janitor, Grace. Christa's patient? He had nothing to do with politics or the election. He was the man who sweeps the floor every night.
