 ♪♪ 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Dr. Nolan. 
 Hey. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 I have a Halloween date. 
 Oh. Where you headed? 
 Pop-up haunted house. 
 It's called "the haunting of Adeline Kingston." 
 I'm sure you have no idea who that is. 
 Adeline Kingston... the silent film star that stabbed nine people to death at the lamour theater in the '20s before killing herself. 
 Old movie buff? 
 Old murder buff. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Where's the, uh, hot date? 
 Uh... 
 [Radio chatter] 
 His Batmobile is parked out back. 
 Is that your kid? 
 Boyfriend's. 
 Uh, he had to go to San Diego, so I agreed to take him. 
 Meantime, try to survive tonight. 
 That sounds ominous. 
 It's Halloween in Los Angeles. 
 Brings out all the demons. [Chuckles] 
 Will : If we keep Mike intubated any longer, we're increasing his risk of laryngeal stenosis and hospital-acquired pneumonia. 
 I'd like to schedule a tracheostomy. 
 What's going on? 
 Angus. I was, uh, visiting Mike. 
 I just happened to run into Dr. Campbell making his rounds. 
 You didn't tell him to meet you here? 
 Not without you, of course not. 
 Did I hear you say you wanna put a hole in my brother's throat? 
 Mike's been on the vents, intubated for more than three weeks now. 
 Which is already one week longer than he should've been. 
 Mike's been showing signs of higher brain function just this week. 
 He's been having spontaneous respirations and purposeful movements. 
 I would debate whether those movements were purposeful or not. 
 But the larger point is, he's not ready to come off the vent. 
 I second that. 
 I-I've been doing some research. 
 There's this study... 
 Study? 
 Six  studies, actually. 
 Done in the United Kingdom. 
 Based on Mike's criteria, there seems to be up to a 30% chance that he will breathe on his own if we extubate him now. 
 And a 70% chance he fails. 
 Angus, an extubation is very risky. 
 Mike could aspirate, become hypoxic. 
 So is a tracheostomy. 
 You could damage his thyroid or drop a lung. 
 Respectfully, I've been doing this job for 20 years and I  know  the risks of each one. 
 As Mike's primary physician, my opinion is to trach him and give him more time. 
 Okay, yeah, but I think if we... 
 What? 
 That a second-year resident knows more than the chief of surgery? 
 This is my son we're talking about. Your brother. 
 Now do you really want to roll the dice on a study you found on the Internet? 
 Or should we listen to his doctor? 
 Leanne : What do you got? 
 31-year-old male. 
 Hand trauma from punching through a windshield, multiple lacs. Found two bags of meth on him. 
 He's coming for me, man. Let me go. 
 Okay, who's coming for you, buddy? 
 The devil! Chasing me! 
 B.P.'S off the charts. 
 Leanne : Okay, let's sedate him before he strokes out. 
 Mario : Take him to triage. 
 What you got, Guthrie? 
 Just rolling in. 
 23-year-old male with shortness of breath and cough from smoke inhalation. 
 Okay, he's got soot in his mouth and his nose and... 
 And a fake knife in his neck. 
 Scattered wheezes. 
 Okay, Dr. Pineda, what do you want to do? 
 Airway burn. We should intubate. 
 What happened? 
 A haunted theater downtown caught on fire. 
 The lamour theater? That's where Dr. Nolan went. 
 The fire caused the cave-in. It's a mess down there. 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Horn blares] 
 [Crash] 
 Aah! [Gasps] 
 Hell, she's a kid. 
 Help me. You need to save my grandpa. 
 He's having a heart attack! 
 Ethan : Possible M.I. 
 Leanne : What's your name, sweetheart? 
 Erica. I need to call my mom. 
 Erica, we're gonna call your mom. 
 Ethan : We need a gurney over here. 
 Eloise, please. 
 Yes, doctor. 
 Ethan : Let's get him an E.K.G., troponin, and a chest X-ray. 
 You're gonna go in with this nice nurse here, and she's gonna check you out. 
 Let's get her mom in here now. 
 I can't see the cords. 
 Probably anterior. 
 Here. I'll reposition. 
 Watch that tray, nurse. 
 Yeah, coming through. 
 Ethan : Pulse is thready. Pressure's dropping. 
 Leanne : Okay, S.T. Elevation in the precordial leads. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 He's in v-tach. Crash cart! 
 Okay, blood pressure's 70 over 52, guys. 
 What about now? Where's those paddles? 
 Come on, come on, come on. Bring it in. Bring it in. 
 B.P.'S crashing. 
 I see them now. 
 Rollie : Good. 
 Toss me the tube. 
 Tube. 
 Pressure's dropping. 
 Come on, come on. I need the pads. 
 [Defibrillator whines] 
 I think I'm in. 
 Good, good, good. All right, I got it. 
 [Beeping] 
 [Exhales] 
 Okay. 
 Color change, you see that? We're good. 
 Leanne : He's not gonna make it. 
 [Thumps] 
 Angus : Wait. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Precordial thump. Old school. 
 Let's move that out of there. 
 Okay, 300 push, followed by 1 mil per minute drip, please. 
 And let's get him to the cath lab now. 
 They're saying 40 or more injured at the lamour theater. 
 Jesse : Theater fire? Sounds like it's gonna get real busy here real fast. 
 Dr. Nolan is in there. 
 Ethan : I'm going down there. 
 Get me a couple first-years... Noa, Elliot, Charlotte. 
 They're gonna be our patients anyway. 
 It's one of our own down there. 
 Okay. Take Noa and Elliot, but Charlotte's gotta stay. 
 Thank you. 
 And, Dr. Willis... 
 Be careful. 
 Okay, guys. Come on. Let's go! 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 [Line ringing] Dr. Dixon, Dr. Kean, you're with me. 
 Ethan? 
 Amanda? 
 Thank god. I-I can't get through to 9-1-1. 
 The... the roof caved in. 
 Slow down. Where are you? 
 The... the theater. 
 [Electricity buzzing] 
 I... Oh, god. Ian ran ahead and he's trapped inside the projection booth. 
 And I keep yelling, but he's not answering. 
 [Line drops, beeping] 
 Hello? 
 Amanda? 
 [Man groans] 
 Hello? 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Where are we going? 
 A haunted house. 
 He's coming! The devil! 
 Happy Halloween. 
 [Alarm ringing] 
 Keep moving towards the front door here. 
 Shortness of breath or chest pain or anything? 
 [Coughing] 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Man : This way. Clear the way. 
 Man : Watch it. Everybody outside. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 [Man speaks indistinctly] 
 Noa : Over here, over here. 
 Excuse me. Here. 
 Ethan : Turn her over. 
 One, two... 
 Man. That looked real. 
 [Cellphone beeping] 
 I can't get through to Amanda. 
 [Error tone beeping] 
 [Beep] 
 All right. We gotta go. 
 Guys, work fast, work safe, work together. 
 Don't make any mistakes. Don't kill anybody. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Good teaching style. 
 I need another medic up here. Come on! 
 Hello? Amanda? 
 Hello? 
 [1920s jazz music playing] 
 ♪♪ Hello? Amanda! [Lights clank] ♪♪ [Electricity crackles] Is somebody there? [Women scream] Amanda : [Muffled voice] Ian? Can you hear me? Ian! Hello? I'm back here! Amanda? Ethan? Oh, my god! Thank god. Oh, my... Are you okay? I'm... I'm fine. I... Ian is on the other side of this. [Coughs] Ian! I've been yelling forever. He's not answering. Does he have a cellphone with him? Yes. All right, let's try that. Oh... Ian! Ian! [Cellphone ringing] Ian, please answer us! Ethan : Ian? [Ring] Ian, can you hear us? [Ring] Oh, come on, buddy. [Grunts, groans] [Electricity crackles] [Weakly] I'm here. [Ring] I think. Oh, my god. Oh, buddy, pick up your phone. Oh. [Coughing] Ian, how you doing in there? Cut my leg. Dang it. Okay, can you... Can you show me the cut? Yeah. [Groans] There's a lot of blood. It hurts. [Gasps] We gotta get in there. [Coughing] That was our only way out. [Indistinct conversations] And get me an E.T.A. from the blood bank. [Telephone rings] You called for me? Yes. We need another pair of hands down here. When can I go back to the O.R.? I know you're still pissed about the E.C.M.O. procedure. But Willis felt... I'm not Willis. Assist the E.R. staff, basic suturing. Anything more complicated, page me. Should I page you for runny noses, too? You know what your problem is, Dr. Pinkney? Your mouth is smarter than your brain. It's one of two things that holds you back. What's the other? Blind ambition. Puts your patients at risk, not to mention this hospital. Now the next time you defy my explicit instructions, you're out. Consider yourself warned. [Sighs] What are you doing, Dr. Savetti? Pulling glass out of this meth head's hand. I gave him 2 milligrams of ativan. Dr. Campbell, O.R. needs you upstairs. Yes, I'll be right there. Just wrap him up and get him to the waiting room. I need you seeing patients. He is a patient. Who is sedated with a low acuity injury. Move him. He can sleep it off. He was having a heart attack when he arrived at the hospital, but now your father's stable. But we had to take him to the cath lab. Cath lab? They're trying to open his arteries with small catheters. You're very lucky she was here. She was incredibly brave. Grandpa fell down when we were trick-or-treating. I called 9-1-1 like you taught us, but it took too long. The doctors told me, sweetie. I'm so proud of you. No more driving until you're 16, okay? Tyler. Where have you been? You were the one who was supposed to take your sister trick-or-treating. [Door closes] I went to a Halloween party. Okay? Grandpa said he'd take her. Your grandfather had a heart attack. Is he okay? [Voice breaks] He's alive, no thanks to you. So this is gonna be my fault? Had you taken her like I'd asked you, this might not have happened. Or grandpa's old. That's what happens to old people. Leanne : All right. That's my father you're talking... Hey, hey, hey, hey. Just calm down. Okay. [Crying] Just breathe. It's okay. Amanda : Oh, my god. I'm coming for you, Ian! Please be careful. Oh! There's no handle. The door's stuck shut. [Grunts] [Grunts] All right, Ian. We're gonna stop the bleeding, okay? Do you have a belt on your costume? Batman's utility belt. It's... it's thick plastic. It's won't work. Okay, Ian, can you look around the room for me? I need you to find a pen and an electrical cord or something that you can wrap around your leg. [Screaming] Oh, god. That's the room she hanged herself in. It's not real, Ian. I'm not scared. Amanda, where's my dad? He's... he's... He's in San Diego, but he's driving as fast as he can. Just... just hold tight. Ian, I need you to be brave, okay? Like Batman. He's not afraid of anything. And I need you to find that cord. Found a cord and a pen. This is great. You're doing great. I want you to take the cord and tie it around your leg  right above the cut, and tie it in a knot. Great. Now take the pen and... and stick it in the knot. Like this? Good. Now twist it. Twice, as tight as you can so you really feel the cord tighten. Now take the pen and put it underneath the cord to secure it. Great job, Ian. Has the bleeding slowed down? Yes. It's not bleeding as much now. But my stomach... still hurts. Wait, your... your stomach hurts? Where? All over. Something fell on it.  [Gasps] He's sounding tight. Mm-hmm. Dr. Piel, what do you wanna start this patient on? Albuterol and atrovent, followed by steroids, solumedrol 125 milligrams I.V. push. Leanne : Dr. Piel, I need you to decompress the waiting room, please. It's starting to get backed up out there. [Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [Monitor beeping steadily] Please don't make me do the waiting room. Whenever I'm out there, people start taking pictures, asking for autographs, calling me Jessamine. I mean, they see me as a movie star, not a doctor. How do you see yourself? I'm a doctor. Doctors see patients wherever they are. Go on. Okay. [Indistinct shouting] [Coughing] Elliot : There's deep soft tissue bruising around her neck. That's makeup. Adeline hanged herself in the projection room. Don't you know the story? Burn patients dehydrate quickly. She needs fluids. Let's put in an I.V. Okay, I need you to... I need you to put the phone over where it hurts. All right, Ian, is that bruise bigger than it was before? I don't know,  but it hurts a lot more now. That's a Grey-Turner sign. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. My stomach sticks out  like my mom's did. Oh, god. His mother died of leukemia two years ago. Am I sick like her? No, sweetie. We're gonna get you out and we're gonna fix you up, okay? I need you to hang on for me, Batman. Okay? Angus : Clear. [Paddles thunk] What happened? [Monitor beeping rapidly] Cath lab didn't work. He's in v-fib arrest. It's been 30 minutes. We can't break it. Okay, let me in. I got Willis for you. Hold on, please. Dad? What's happening to him? Can you step her aside, please, Eloise? Dr. Leighton. Shocked him at 200 three times. He's saying it's an emergency here. Leanne : Shock him again. Clear. Leanne : Thank you. A little busy, Willis. What you got? I've got a kid here with blunt abdomen trauma and a retroperitoneal bleed. No pulse. Uh, how far out are you? That's why I'm calling. We're trapped. I'm gonna need you to send out a R.E.B.O.A. Kit  to be ready as soon as they get us out. I was paged. Is this the guy waiting for bypass surgery? 84-year-old male in v-fib. Clear. [Paddles thunk] You guys are the ones who invented R.E.B.O.A., so you know how delicate it is. To put a catheter into that child's aorta in an uncontrolled environment, every... R.E.B.O.A.? Who... who is that? The kid'll die if we don't do it now. He's losing consciousness. Hey, Leanne, I want to have the R.E.B.O.A. kit ready for me when I'm ready to go. It's on its way. It's on its way where? Okay, he's still in v-fib. Anything else you wanna try? Uh, 100 of Lidocaine. Dr. Rorish, I'm asking you a question. Okay, look, Nolan and a kid are trapped in the theater fire, and Willis went down to try and save them. And I sent Noa and Elliot, too. What? So fire me. First, can we get him the tools to maybe save a life? Hopefully, one of us can. How long has it been? 33 minutes. 4 rounds of epi. [Monitor beeping erratically] Okay, okay, stop, stop. Hold the C.P.R. Hold it. Hold it. I'm calling it. Any suggestions? Time of death... 11:32 P.M. [Monitor stops beeping] Now I've gotta go out and tell Cheryl that her father has died. How about that R.E.B.O.A. kit? Nurse, get a R.E.B.O.A. Kit down to the lamour theater, A.S.A.P. Thank you. [Exhales] Ian, good news. Help is on the way. [Rumbling] [Amanda screams] Ethan! What was that? [Coughing] Amanda! [Coughs] [Cries] [Coughs] Can you breathe all right? [Strained voice] Yeah, I-I'm okay. I... Can you feel... feel your legs? Yeah. Yes, yeah. All right. [Inhales sharply] You're gonna be okay. Okay, I'm gonna get you out of here. [Coughs] Oh, god. [Groans] [Coughing] [Wood creaking] [Whispers] Okay. I'll pull you out. Okay. [Screaming] You good? You good? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
 
 Ethan? Amanda? Hello? How you doing? [Coughs] I'm fine. [Screams] No, you're not fine. You have a displaced rib. Is Ian... is Ian okay? He's weak, but he's hanging in there, which is what I need you to do. [Breathing heavily] Hang on. [Electricity crackles] [Metal rattling] I'll be back. I'm coming, Ian! Ethan! Hurry up. Hang in there, buddy. I'm trying to get this door open. [Objects thud] All right. Ethan. Okay, can you give me your hand? It hurts. Please, get me out of here. I got him. [Exhales] [Whimpers] I got you, buddy. Thank god. [Breathing heavily] Okay. You'll be okay. You're both gonna be okay. Morphine should kick in any second. Get off me. Calm down, please. We are trying to help you. I can't believe I took this gig. I will tell you one thing, I am firing my idiot agent. [Exhales] There's the morphine. You're a swell fella, Clark. Say, take me to Kentucky to see your horses, won't you? No idea. Just place the line. Yeah. Can you do it without an ultrasound? I'm using landmarks, okay. Doing this Rorish style. And I'm in. All right, now let's get some fluids going. Oh, god. That's not the vein, that's the artery. Hold pressure. Yeah. We'll try on the other side. Okay? Okay. [Siren wailing] [Indistinct conversations] [Camera shutter clicks] Look at it this way... Everyone here has had their night ruined. But you? You're the lucky one who gets to make it right. If I were you, I'd start... There. Okay. You make a fierce Jessamine. You really think so? [Chuckles] I know so. [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] My mom's freaking out. She won't stop crying. Her father died. I killed him, didn't I? Come with me. I'm wanna show you something. You see these overinflated lungs? That's emphysema. Yeah, he smoked a lot. And this is his angiogram. It's a picture of the vessels in his heart. That right there, this is his coronary artery and these are blockages along the way. That's why he died... A lifetime of hard living. That's not why he died tonight. He died 'cause I wasn't there with him. Tyler, he could've just as easily died yesterday or tomorrow. He was a ticking time bomb. I was supposed to be taking care of him. She's always gonna think this is my fault and hate me for it. Tyler, she thinks it's  her  fault and she hates herself for it. [Indistinct conversations] [Exhales] He loved you so much. [Door closes] You know, grandpa had a good life. This isn't your fault. [Crying] This isn't anybody's fault. [Crying] How you feeling? My stomach really hurts. Good job on the tourniquet. [Groans] Okay, I just need you to hang on a little bit longer. Can you do that? [Groans] [Indistinct conversations] [Telephone rings] All right, let's go get you some candy. [Radio chatter] Oh. Damn it. Let me help you with that. No, no, I'm fine. It's okay. I... No, no. I'm fine, Dr. Pineda. Thank you. You're gonna let Campbell trach him? Seems to be the best option. What about all the research you did? I know, but the odds are still against this working. That's not what you said. You said those were exactly the kind of odds Mike would like. I don't know what Mike would like because he can't tell me. He doesn't have to. That's the point of having you be his medical proxy. If he couldn't speak for himself, he trusted you to do it. What am I supposed to do? Tell the head of surgery at Angels... I don't give a damn about Campbell. Neither should you. This is my brother's life we're talking about. Like I don't know that? You think he didn't know that? This wasn't casual for Mike, okay? He got in his car, he drove to a lawyer's office, he wrote down your name. Not your dad's, not Campbell's,  yours. And what are you doing with that responsibility, huh? You're giving it to the people he didn't want to have it. This is none of your business. Apparently, none of yours either, right? [Ian breathing shallowly] Morphine's doing its job. You want some? No. [Grunts] [Inhales sharply] Just, uh, talk to me. Okay, I'm gonna put that rib back in. It's compromising your lung function. [Grunts] As enticing as you make that sound, I-I think I'll wait for an O.R. [Gasping] How did you end up here? I hopped in the back of an ambulance. No. Not  here. H-here, in... in L.A. Tell me the mystery of Ethan Willis. I was in Afghanistan. I got wind of a sick kid in a nearby village... Anwar. But, um, he wouldn't come to our base. His parents were afraid he'd be spotted. So you went to him? No kid in 2016 should die of appendicitis. So I took it out. Anwar came through it fine. Then, um... A couple days later, patrol found his body in the road. He'd been, uh... Shot in the head. And they ripped open his sutures. You think it was your fault? I'm not the animal that did that to him. You feel guilty? No, it's not guilt. It's complicated. [Gasps] Try me. They threw the body of a little kid in the middle of the road to send us a message, send  me  a message... No more American medicine. Did it stop you? The opposite. I wasn't gonna be scared off by those savages. Against orders, I went to every single village and treated every single person who asked. 'Till I got caught. Criminal act of kindness. You were Robin hood of medicine. [Gasps] My superior officers didn't see it as an act of kindness. They saw it as an act of defiance. Was it? [Breathing shallowly] You're damn right it was. [Man shouting indistinctly] You hear that? They're coming. Hello?! [Man shouts indistinctly] We're in here! Man : We'll be right there! Man 2 : Get away from the wall. Amanda? Amanda. Amanda, no, no, no. Hang on, hang on. [Man shouting indistinctly] [Bones crunch] [Gasps] Man : Steer clear! Hey, is everybody okay in there? We found 'em! [Siren whoops] [Inhales sharply] [Breathing heavily] Distorted male voice :  They're coming for you. They know where you are. They're comin'. [Laughs] Here he comes. He's right, get out. [Speaks indistinctly] Right there! They're all looking at you. [Distorted voices echo] What you looking at? [Overlapping voices] [Gruff voice] Are you scared? [Screams] Sheriff : Hey! Settle down. Man : Get him away from me! Stop. Get him away from me! Stop! Stop! [Grunting] [Woman screaming] Everyone down! Woman : Get down! Get down on the floor! Watch your heads! [Gunshots] [Woman screams] [Monitor beeping steadily] Did you hear that? Focus, Dr. Pineda. We need to stop the bleeding here. [Gunshot] [All screaming] [Grunting] Get off me! Get off me! [Handcuffs clink] You got him? Sheriff : Yeah. You okay? Heads down! Angus! Make sure no one's hurt. [All shouting indistinctly] Dr. Rorish, over here. Where is my daughter?! Mario : Stay down! Oh, my god. She's been shot! I'm okay, mommy. [Mouths words] Leanne : Put some pressure on the wound. Angus : Charlotte's been shot. Mario : Let's go! Gurney, now! [Shouts indistinctly] Hold on. Easy. Easy. [Whispers] Come here. Are you all right? [Indistinct conversations] Where's the entrance wound? I can't see it. Jessamine! Hey, no. Jessamine! No, no, no, no. Shh. Jessamine! Hey. No, it's okay. It's okay. Leanne : Let's get her to center stage. Okay, rise up, let's go. Move, move. Clear the way! Girl : Jessamine! Someone's been shot in the waiting room. Nobody move. Is it an active shooter? No. Looks like they got him. Move out of the way! Slow it down. Slow it down. [Monitor beeping steadily] Jesse : Make room. Oh, my god. It's Charlotte. What happened? Activate the M.T.P. Pulse is thready. Leanne : Okay, I need to intubate now. Take over, please, Angus. Got it. Entry wound to the left axilla. Exit wound... Right anterior chest with... Diminished breath sounds bilaterally. She needs bilateral chest tubes. I got this side. Dr. Savetti? Woman : Heart rate 106! This is Eloise Munello. I need 8... No, 10 units of o-neg, stat. Blood is on the way. B.P. Is down to 64. Savetti. Savetti! Yeah. I'll place the tube on the right. [Indistinct conversations] [Siren wailing] I need to talk to Dr. Campbell right away. Campbell's in surgery. I have a patient with blunt abdominal trauma, a retroperitoneal bleed. He's in cardiac arrest. I need an O.R. prepped for an open laparotomy. How far out are you? 15 minutes. You're not gonna make it. Yes, I am. 'Cause I'm stabilizing him with R.E.B.O.A.. In the back of a moving ambulance? If you misplace the balloon, you'll rip through his aorta. You just have that O.R. prepped. I'll see you in 15. [Crying] What's going on? What do we got? 27-year-old with burns to her upper body. Couldn't get I.V. access. I messed up her central line. The hematoma is compressing her airway. We need to intubate her. Listen, I need both of you to focus on me and your patient. Do you understand? There's nothing else more important right now. What happened? There was a shooting. Jesse : 54! Rollie : Dr. Kean. Dr. Kean! Leanne : Wait. I'm in. Jesse : B.P.'S down to 54. [Indistinct conversations] Gotta run these wide open. I'm in. Bag her up, please. Will : Profuse bleeding on the left. Mario : Bloody output on the right, too. Okay. She needs a bilateral thoracotomy. We need to move her to the O.R. no, no, no. She's not stable. We have to do it here. I appreciate she's one of yours, Dr. Rorish, but she still has vitals. No! She needs to... Stop, stop! Stop. Get it together. Get it together for her. [Monitor beeping rapidly] She's lost her pulse. Starting compressions. Come on! Thoracotomy trays now. Jesse : Let's go! Gloves, please, now. One doctor. Come on, guys. Where's the gloves? Bring it in. [Siren wails] What are you doing? Putting a balloon into his aorta to stop the blood from pouring into his abdomen. You really did this in Afghanistan? That's where we developed it. So you're good at it? Right, Amanda, I need you to listen to me. This is not the best place to do something this delicate, but if we don't try it, we're gonna lose him. [Voice breaks] Don't let this boy die, okay? I won't. [Siren continues wailing] [Amanda speaks indistinctly] 6 centimeters above the xiphoid process. I think I'm there. Please. Please. [Gasps] [Siren wailing] [Monitor beeping steadily] Hold compressions. [Beeping stops] Did it work? [Monitor resumes beeping] [Exhales] [Indistinct conversations] Sixth unit of blood is in. [Indistinct conversations] There's a hole in the ventricle. Dr. Savetti, come and get your finger in here and do compressions. Looks like the bullet hit the hilum. 4-0 prolene, please. Noa : He's putting his finger in her heart? Rollie : Dr. Kean, your patient is here. Leanne : I need suction. Woman : Where's the Lidocaine? Dr. Guthrie, I'm pretty good with the fiber optic, you want me to try? No, I got it. I've got it. I feel it. I'm in the ventricle. Will : Clamps. Leanne : Savetti? Anything? Mario : Still not beating. Leanne : We keep working, then. Uh, retractor, please. [Exhales deeply] Okay. We have a pulse. Oh, thank god. I can feel the aorta. Clamps. Hold it, hold it. I can't... Stop... This bleeding! [Suction gurgling] [Siren wails] Better have the O.R. ready. They're here now. Ethan : We have a pulse. It's thready, but it is there. You can watch from up top. Is the O.R. ready? Yes, but we don't have a surgeon available. That's not true. I know two that are available... you and me. When we get up there, we have to move quickly. You don't have O.R. privileges, and I'm on probation. You know I can't. I don't care about any of that. Campbell will fire me. This kid's gonna die. Are you a surgeon or not? I can't just throw away my career. This  is  your career, right here. This is a patient, you're a doctor. Make a decision. Heather : He's got at least 4 liters of blood in here. B.P.'S down to 67 over 30. Hang more blood, please. Ethan, what's going on? Just sit tight. A little bump in the road. He tore through his kidney, his ileum, his celiac artery... [whispers] He's a mess. [Suction gurgling] We are not going to lose this kid. [Monitor beeping erratically] Down to 42 systolic. Nylon suture. [Beeping continues] [Whispers] Come on. We should just crack his chest and cross-clamp. No. Just... I'm almost there. Pressure, pressure. All right? Yep. Scissors. The field looks dry. What's our B.P.? Back up to 80 over 52. [Monitor beeping steadily] You did it. Dr. Willis, do you want me to close? No, I... I'd like to do it myself. Thank you. I mean it. Thank you, doctor. Angus : 10th unit of blood is in. [Speaks indistinctly] Okay, hilum is tied off. Bleeding controlled. Ventricle's repaired, too. Come back to us, Charlotte. Come on. Mario : Still no cardiac activity. There must be something more we can do. She's been down too long. She's lost too much blood. [Monitor emitting continuous tone] Uh, no. We can move her to the O.R. Get her on bypass. Dr. Rorish... Get ready to move her, people. You know we're past that. [Crying] No. I gotta call it. No. She's  my  responsibility. Time of death... 3:14 A.M. [Continuous tone] Somebody,  please  turn that off. [Tone stops] Sorry. [Whispers] Sorry. Jesse : I'm so sorry. ♪♪ It's not your fault. Don't say that. That's not true. You knew it the moment you saw where the bullet hit. How many patients have we saved with that injury? Zero. But I'm the one that sent her out there to the waiting room. You didn't send her out there to get killed. You sent her out there to treat patients. But what if I hadn't? What if we hadn't cleared that meth patient? Or what if I had just sent her with Willis? She's... [inhales sharply] Someone's daughter. Jesse... [Sniffles] I gotta go call her mother. [Sighs] [Door opens] Dr. Pinkney, I just saw Dr. Willis downstairs, and... If you wanna fire me, go ahead. But can you just wait till tomorrow? It's been a terrible night. I am reinstating all your privileges. I don't understand. Last time I defied your orders, I was punished. This time, I'm being rewarded? Last time, you were doing it for yourself. This time, you did it for your patient. Maybe you're a doctor after all. I'm sorry about Charlotte. If anyone could've saved her, it would've been you. Yeah. [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [Telephone rings in distance] Ethan. [Door closes] How you doing, buddy? Awesome. [Chuckles] How you feeling, Dr. Nolan? Uh, look, I... I don't know how to thank you. You don't have to. I do. If you hadn't been there for Ian, for me... [Sighs] I was really scared. So was I. I'm so sorry about Charlotte. So am I. [Door opens] Ian. Amanda : John. Oh, thank god. John. It's okay. He's fine. We're both okay. Oh, my god, Amanda. I know. I know. I'll let you two catch up. No, John. This is... This is Dr. Willis. He saved Ian's life and mine. Thank you. I don't know what I would've done if I'd lost them. That was never gonna happen. [Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [Horns honking in distance] Wait. Wait. Dad, we talked about this. Look, son, if anything should happen to your brother as a result of this, do you really wanna bear that burden? No. [Whispers] But... Mike wanted me to. [Switch clicks, beep] [Monitor beeping steadily] No spontaneous respirations yet. Stop. Just stop all this. We can... We can put him back on. He hasn't had to breathe on his own for a few weeks. It's just gonna take a little time for his body to remember what to do. As long as his sats don't drop below 80... [Inhales deeply] We're okay. Okay, he's at 89. Still dropping. Leanne, please. Come on, Mike. I need you to breathe, okay? Come on. You can do it, Mike. Will : Come on, Mike. [Monitor beeping rapidly] Okay, okay. Come on, you gotta breathe. No, no, no. Leanne : Gotta go. Come on, Mike. You've gotta breathe. It's okay. Desmond : Angus, stand aside. Angus : Hey, come on. I got him. No, no, no, no, no, wait. Come on. [Beeping continues] Angus. Come on, come on. [Inhales shakily] [Monitor beeping steadily] [Poignant music swells]
