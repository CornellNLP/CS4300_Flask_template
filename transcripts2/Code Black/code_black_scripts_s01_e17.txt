 Previously on "Code Black"...  
 I need you to take over the department. 
 No. 
 Not a request. Sorry. 
 I'm not an administrator, Ed. I'm a doctor. 
 Grace. 
 Neal. 
 Christa : So, who's Grace? 
 She's a doctor who used to Work here. 
 I'm asking who she is to  you. 
 You didn't tell her, did you? 
 Of course not. 
 You can't tell anyone. 
 Oh, my god. 
 Don't pull that knife! 
 You and I take this to our graves. 
 [Gagging] Help me. 
 Angus : ♪ sugar plum fairy came and hit the streets ♪ 
♪ looking for soul food and a place to eat ♪ 
♪ went to the Apollo ♪ 
♪ you should've seen 'em go, go, go ♪ 
♪ they said, "hey, sugar, take a walk on the wild side ♪ 
 Angus : She's testing the rest of us. 
 And I don't think I'm gonna pass that test. 
 Cole : Started off saving a life, ended up almost killing someone. 
 You need to pull! 
 We need to get a doctor in here. 
 I'm  a doctor. 
 And you are, too. 
 Mike : You and I take this to our graves. 
 You don't know how good you are, do you? 
 Good. 
 I'm just starting to get on my feet here. 
 ♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo-doo ♪ 
 [Gasping] 
 Heather : Thought you were gonna run through a wall. 
 Have you seen those videos of dogs dreaming? 
 They're chasing something, and all of a sudden, they just wake up, and they run straight into a wall. 
 It's hilarious. 
 Unless you're the dog. 
 This isn't the best place to catch a nap, you know. 
 ICU has a supply closet they're not using, and Peds has an exam room with too much lead paint. 
 Those are the four-star spots. 
 You okay? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 [Clears throat] 
 But, uh, after a cup of coffee, I am good as... new. 
 Great. 
 Here. 
 What's this? 
 Adderall. 
 You have ADHD? 
 No, I'm a surgeon who works 36-hour shifts. 
 It'll focus you in. 
 Silicon Valley runs on this stuff. 
 Well, I am not Steve Jobs. 
 You take Tylenol when you have a headache, right? 
 [Pills rattle] Here. 
 One for now, one for later... if you think you need it. 
 Or  don't  take it. It's up to you. 
 But if you don't take it, I want them back. 
 [Door opens] 
 Angus. Let's go. Shift just started. 
 It's code red already. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 We need more nurses, and we need the ones that we do have to be paid more money. 
 You think I haven't already asked for that? 
 You weren't wearing a white coat before. 
 We waited a long time for one of us to be one of them. 
 What do you got? 
 34-year-old male... motorcycle versus tree. 
 Unresponsive on the scene. B.P. 60/40. 
 Stats falling. Obvious intestinal injury. 
 Page surgery? 
 Yep. 
 Center stage. Let's go. 
 Morning. 
 [Door closes] 
 Good morning. 
 So, how's Neal doing? Did he text you? 
 Nope. 
 What about you? 
 Me? No. 
 I'm sure he's kind of busy. It's his first O.R. shift. 
 It's a long one, though, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 You guys seem good together. 
 Thank you. 
 Nice scarf. 
 It's beautiful, right? 
 I take no credit. It's Neal's. 
 I'm sure it was a gift, though. 
 It's not like he has time to go shopping. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, my god. It was from you. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, birthday or... Christmas I don't remember. 
 It looks great on you. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Bougie, please. 
 Jesse : You okay? 
 Yeah. This airway's just too anterior. 
 Here. 
 Thanks. 
 Sat's in the 80s. 
 Come on, come on. 
 I can't see anything in here. 
 Fishhook, please. 
 Sorry. Out of hands. 
 Where are all the nurses? 
 What have I been telling you? I'm all you got. 
 Page surgery. Where's Neal? 
 Sat's still dropping. 
 Dr. Lorenson? Can you come over here for a minute? 
 Uh, can you get the bag, please? 
 Here you go. 
 Bag. Thanks. 
 Hey, you want to take over here? 
 Converting. 
 [Beeping slows] 
 Sat's rising... finally. 
 About time. 
 What, did you forget where the E.R. is? 
 Too many stairs in this place. 
 How's Campbell? I heard he's tough. 
 He wasn't the one who hired me. I'm still interviewing. 
 What do you have? 
 Leanne : Disembowelment. 
 Any other injuries? 
 Don't see any yet. 
 Okay, run it down for me. 
 I've got it. 
 Dr. Rorish, would you please run it down for me? 
 Sir, traumatic disembowelment. 
 All right, Dr. Hudson, let's move him. Come on. 
 Let's go. 
 No, I really can handle this. 
 Dr. Hudson, you're a new attending. 
 You shadow me until I know what you're capable of. 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go. 
 [Screams] 
 [People murmuring] 
 [Screams] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Man : Let's go, let's go! 
 Hannah : Oh, my god. 
 Security! Doctors! 
 Someone help! 
 [Gasping] 
 Move, move, move! Drop it! Drop the ax! 
 [Gun cocks] You heard him! Drop it! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Don't shoot me. 
 Please, don't don't shoot. 
 [Whimpering] Oh, my leg is killing me. 
 Your  leg? 
 It's makeup. 
 I'm a zombie. 
 Man : We were at a convention. 
 We're not the only ones coming in. 
 There was an accident. Some scaffolding collapsed. 
 I'm sorry if we scared you. 
 Sure. No problem, ma'am. 
 Can you handle this, please? 
 [People murmuring] 
 What the hell? 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm the event medic from the convention. 
 We used one of our shuttles to bring in some of the minor injuries. 
 There were two rigs on the scene when I left. 
 [Sighing] Oh, god. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 We just love zombies, wanted to find a way to celebrate that. 
 Ow! [Inhales sharply] 
 That really hurts. 
 I'll give you some more Lidocaine for the pain. 
 Is she gonna be okay? 
 Yeah. It's mostly lacerations. 
 No fractures. 
 So, what's your favorite zombie movie? 
 "Dawn of the Dead." 
 "Dawn of the Dead." 
 Totally, right? 
 Although "Dead Alive"... crazy-good. 
 Beyond. 
 Never wanted to eat soup again. 
 Oh, my god. Who are you? 
 8-year-old boy complaining of abdominal pain, modest guarding. 
 Stable B.P. in the field. 
 Dr. Savetti, over here. 
 Son, can you hear me? 
 Yeah. I'm okay. 
 44-year-old male with significant crush injury, multiple chest deformities, difficulty breathing. 
 My dad was with me. 
 Bed 3. 
 Dad?! 
 I'm right here, Luke. 
 Dr. Leighton, you're with me. 
 Blood pressure crashing, 60/40. 
 Luke : We were at this really cool zombie thing, right, Dad? 
 We were having so much fun. 
 Okay, ready? 
 And then there was this crash. 
 1, 2, 3. 
 My dad grabbed me. 
 Dad?! Are you there?! 
 Is he okay?! 
 I've barely got a pulse here. 
 Ready? 1, 2, 3. 
 [Breathes shakily] 
 It was all supposed to be pretend. 
 There's blood everywhere. Some of these scalp wounds are real. 
 Which ones are actually bleeding? 
 I can't tell. There's too much fake blood. 
 Peroxide. 
 Huh? 
 It dissolves real blood. Here. 
 Look. Watch for the foamy bubbles there. See? 
 Nice. 
 All right, I need suction and a skin stapler. 
 Where'd you pull that trick from? 
 Summer camp. 
 Lac stabilized. Let's roll him for X-ray. 
 1... 2... 3. 
 Easy. 
 Everything's going to be okay, right? 
 Just hang in there, young vato. 
 This is the best hospital for zombies  and  humans, okay? 
 Easy, now. 
 Luke, do you feel any pain when I press here? 
 No. I'm okay. 
 We've got free fluid. Possible splenic laceration. 
 Sir, sir. Are you still with us? 
 Where's Luke? He's my son. 
 He's right next to you. 
 Over here, Dad! 
 Diaphragm rupture. Get surgery down here now. 
 Ready for liftoff? 
 Cole : All right, let's get him up to C.T. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 [Gurgles] Dad! 
 Mike : Oh, god. Are you okay?! 
 All right, hematemesis. 
 I need an airway ready. 
 Dad! 
 Somebody call the O.R. 
 Get the kid moving! Let's go, let's go! 
 Dad! 
 Come on, son. 
 Psst! 
 Hey. You see that yellow tag on the chart? 
 V.I.P. 
 [Scoffs] Lucky me. 
 Big donors. They have a whole floor named after them. 
 Made their money on a huge pet-food website. 
 Not that you're checking. 
 Listen, my advice is to hurry. 
 The suits are gonna be down here soon enough. 
 Robert : Yeah, yeah. Listen, I got to go. 
 Hello. I'm Dr. Pineda. What brings you here? 
 My husband needs his phone surgically detached from his ear. 
 I'll speak to you Tuesday. 
 Sorry. I'm sorry. 
 Sunday's actually a workday for me. 
 They  all  are. And I told you that you didn't need to come. 
 And let you skip tomorrow's mediation? 
 You missed the last two meetings... which I had to pay for. 
 We are in the middle of a cooperative divorce. 
 If you were cooperative, we wouldn't be getting divorced. 
 So, Mrs. Stein, uh, what are you here for today? 
 I'm having stomach pains. 
 It's always something. 
 Do you think I want to be in the E.R.? 
 Honestly, Susan, I don't know  what  you want. 
 Ohh! Ow! 
 It's okay. Tell me exactly where it hurts. 
 Can you get Dr. Rorish? 
 Uh, Dr. Rorish is in administration now, and I'm perfectly capable... 
 I'm calling Harbert. 
 [Groaning] 
 Feel the trachea. I think I'm in. 
 You  think? 
 You need more suction? 
 Yeah, I can't see anything with this blood. 
 He's not in. Stats are still dropping. 
 Mike : All right. It's a tough airway. 
 Let me try. I'll grab a D.L. and a bougie. 
 I got one. 
 Hey. 
 You carry an extra bougie in your pocket? 
 Angus, you're never gonna see anything down there. 
 There's too much blood. 
 A bit more. I've got the cords. 
 I'm... in. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Bag him up. 
 Sats improving. Nice job. 
 Great, man. 
 Heather : Dr. Leighton, what do we have? 
 We've got a crush injury, severe gastric bleeding. 
 Concerned for diaphragm rupture. 
 Okay. How much blood loss? 
 300 cc. His airway is secure. 
 Okay. Let's prep him for transport. 
 Jesse : Taking out the scope. 
 Leslie : Oh, my god. 
 Luke, what happened? 
 Are you family? 
 Yes. 
 There was an incident that happened at the... 
 I told them not to go to that thing. 
 No, Luke here is gonna be just fine, but... 
 But what? Where's Ben? 
 He was sent up to the O.R. 
 Oh, my god. 
 Listen, I know this is a lot to take in, but we need to know if he has any other medical problems. 
 That would help the surgeons right now. 
 Uh, no. No. I don't think so. 
 No, no other problems. He's healthy. 
 Luke? You okay? 
 Luke? Listen, listen. 
 I know this is tough, but the boy needs to see you being strong. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Luke, I'm gonna let you and your mother spend some time... 
 She's  not  my mom. 
 I'm Ben's fiancée. 
 We're supposed to be getting married next week. 
 [Sighs] 
 I texted you. 
 I saw three dots, like you were typing something, and then they just went away. 
 Yeah? 
 I guess I realized that I had nothing to say. 
 See, this is why we're not hooking up anymore. 
 Well. 
 That explains a lot. 
 Let's go, guys. We have to get him upstairs. 
 This is beyond simple, and I'm not sure why we're still talking about it. 
 Because it's dangerous. 
 It's dangerous that the steins want you to be their doctor? 
 Not just that. 
 You want an elite experience for them, but this isn't an airline loyalty program. 
 Exactly. [Chuckles] 
 It is much more important that these people helped modernize Angels. 
 These are investments that we all benefit from. 
 You know the data. 
 V.I.P. treatment in a hospital can be dangerous. 
 Protocols get sidestepped. 
 Safety measures fall through the cracks. 
 That's why medical mistakes happen so often with fams patients. 
 Then  I'll  take the case. 
 My scrubs are still in the closet. 
 Oh, well, while you're in there, see if you can hire more nurses. 
 My people are working way too hard. 
 More nurses? 
 This is Angels. We  all  work way too hard. 
 We don't have enough money. 
 Why do you think we're always in code black? 
 Because you people think like suits. 
 You don't understand our needs. 
 Despite the scrubs you're wearing, you are a suit now, too, Leanne. 
 The budgets... have you read them yet? 
 I am making my way through them. 
 It's not exactly a page-turner. 
 Ironic that there is a man out there who could get you nurses  tomorrow. 
 He's sitting with his wife, but you won't see them. 
 Did it ever occur to you that you don't have to buy these people? 
 Maybe they give out of the kindness of their hearts. 
 No. 
 Good day, Doctor. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 16-year-old boy. Fell downstairs. 
 Minor burns, no K.O. 
 Hey. How you doing, buddy? 
 Fine. I fell. This is all probably overkill. 
 Did you see the incident, sir? 
 No, I didn't. 
 And who are you? 
 Craig James. I run a boot camp for troubled teens. 
 He's one of my campers. 
 Sorry, Mr. James. I'm sorry to be a problem like this. 
 Anything else you can tell us? 
 Nothing. 
 We were out doing our morning workout, and he came back looking like this. 
 [Gasps] 
 Dr. Lorenson, why don't you take a look at his injuries? 
 I am going to start the paperwork with you, sir, right here. 
 So, if he disappeared, why didn't you go looking for him? 
 We did. The last place we thought he'd go back to was the dorms. 
 He's tried to run away before, so... 
 [Groans] 
 These bruises on your face and arms... how did you get them? 
 Uh, it's, uh, really dumb, actually. 
 I fell down some stairs. 
 And these circular burns on your arms... did someone do this to you? 
 No. I, uh, messed up the campfire one night. It's all good. 
 I don't understand how you got these from a campfire. 
 Aah! 
 O... okay, All right, okay. 
 Does that hurt? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Okay, hang on. Okay. All right. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Okay, Brody, don't move your arm. 
 You have a really serious fracture. 
 Where are his parents? 
 New York. And he's not allowed to talk to them. 
 Those are the rules. It's tough, I know. 
 We push them hard, and sometimes this even Works. 
 These are bad kids. 
 Do you want to explain to me how this boy came in here with burns, dehydration, and a proximal humeral fracture? 
 What are you accusing me of? 
 What are you telling them? 
 I didn't say anything to anyone. 
 You're starting to mess with too many people. 
 Okay, that's enough. 
 Hannah, can you take this gentleman to registration, please? 
 Dr. Lorenson, you with me... now. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I don't understand how you can be pissed when I'm doing exactly what I  should  be doing. 
 We don't make conclusions like that 30 seconds into the exam. 
 You weren't in the exam. It doesn't matter. 
 Irrespective of what you found, you led with your feelings. 
 My  feelings? 
 You don't confront people like that. 
 This whole thing just exploded. 
 It's unacceptable. 
 With all due respect, I was a doctor responding to information that you weren't privy to. 
 Now, are you upset about something else, or is that it? 
 If I were you, I'd keep your mind on the medicine. 
 Have you seen the chart for my Peds patient? 
 I know I left it here somewhere. Nope. 
 His name is Elliot Lautner. He has croup. 
 I said I haven't seen it. 
 [Slams folder] 
 Hey. 
 You know that Neal isn't interested in her anymore, right? 
 Here it is. 
 Will : So, this guy got injured at a zombie convention? 
 Is that a thing? 
 Dr. Hudson, you could at least  try  to keep up with me. 
 I can help. 
 It's fine. I've got it. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 B.P. is dropping. He's unstable. 
 It's an intercostal bleed. 
 Well, hold down this vessel. 
 Here. Yeah. 
 Ligate here. Okay, now tie it off proximately. 
 [Beeping continues] 
 Another suture, please. 
 You didn't close it down enough. 
 You got one more shot at this bleed, Dr. Hudson. 
 The problem here is this shiny structure, the vagus nerve. 
 What's gonna happen if Dr. Hudson cuts it, Dr. Pinkney? 
 The nerve supply to the heart and lungs will be cut off. 
 And we're running out of time. 
 His pressure is dangerously low. 
 Let's see how fast you can tie this up. 
 I'm sure Dr. Hudson has done it hundreds of times. 
 He's not a resident. 
 Well, then, he won't mind doing it again. 
 Of course not. 
 Cut here, please. 
 [Snip] 
 [Beeping stops] 
 Done. 
 Bleeding's stopped, nerve is safe, and blood pressure coming back up. 
 All right. Close it up for me, will you? 
 Harbert : Well, we cleared it out. 
 I had you moved in here as soon as I found out that you arrived. 
 You'll have more privacy. 
 We got some food coming in from across the street. 
 Where's the minibar, Ed? 
 That's very funny. 
 So, you have cramps and nausea. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Is this real, or is it just, like, bad Sushi or something? 
 Maybe you should go home. 
 Oh, so you can tell your lawyer that I left you here all alone? 
 No, thanks. 
 Harbert : I've already put in for a C.T. scan. 
 I'll get you one of our G.I. specialists. 
 Here. We'll need a urine sample... pregnancy test. 
 Oh, she's not pregnant. 
 Did you have a tubal ligation, a hysterectomy? 
 No. 
 Look, we've been trying to get pregnant for years now, okay? 
 A fertility doctor bought a new house with our money. 
 A pregnancy test is standard. 
 Dr. Pineda, let's skip it. 
 Yeah, trust me... she'd have a better chance with a powerball ticket. 
 Give me the damn cup. 
 I  might  be pregnant. 
 Excuse me? 
 I know it's not mine. You're already screwing someone? 
 Oh, you're an idiot. 
 One thing we never did was lie to each other. 
 I implanted the last two embryos. 
 What? Without telling me? 
 What do you care? You're leaving. 
 Those are  my  embryos, too! 
 Maybe we'll give you a minute. 
 Oh, we're gonna need more than a minute. 
 Take as many as you want. Dr. Pineda. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 I should have told you about Heather. 
 Why would you tell me? We weren't dating. 
 It still hurts. 
 Can I get more of that? 
 Yeah, Sandy. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll, uh, get some more saline for the irrigation. 
 I'll be right back. 
 I'll be back. 
 Angus. 
 It's over with us anyway. She drove me crazy. 
 She kept blocking me, then unblocking me. 
 She was screwing Campbell at the same time. 
 Oh, my god! 
 I know, right? 
 We are not doing this. 
 Have you heard her laugh? It's more of a cackle. 
 She has no idea how to roll down a tube of toothpaste. 
 I mean, surgeon? Really? 
 I don't care. 
 What? 
 I don't... care. 
 And, by the way, you can't be this annoyed with someone you  don't  like. 
 Dr. Leighton. You got a minute? 
 Yeah. 
 How's, uh, Ben Barton doing? 
 Just got out of the O.R. 
 He's in critical condition, but he should pull through. 
 Ah. That's great work by the team. 
 Angus, he's alive 'cause you were prepared. 
 You nailed that airway, man. I'm proud of you. 
 Well, I'm, uh, still working on taking a compliment, but, um, thank you. 
 Well, whatever you're doing, just keep doing it. 
 [Pats] We're all noticing. 
 You know what  I'm  noticing? 
 What? 
 That beard. 
 Long shifts. 
 
 
 
 [Door opens] 
 [Radio chatter] 
 [Coughing] 
 Christa : What's happening? 
 He suddenly started vomiting. Heart rate in the hundreds. 
 Help. I don't know what's wrong with me. 
 Okay, that's why I'm here. 
 Start fluids. Give 4 of zofran. 
 Did we get an EKG with that heart rate? 
 EKG normal. Rhythm, blood gas unremarkable. 
 And no evidence of internal bleeding on the C.T.s? 
 No. 
 I think I'm hyperventilating. 
 Okay. Just take deep breaths for me, all right? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 That should make you feel better. 
 [Breathing deeply] Okay. Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Snuck off by yourself, huh? 
 Everybody else was outside. 
 Yeah. 
 I left. I just wanted to go home. 
 Home like your bunk or... ? 
 Home. 
 [Voice breaking] I can't take it anymore. 
 We have to wake up at 5:00 in the morning, run for an hour and a half, pick up tires, run with those. 
 He put me on nothing but white rice and beans. 
 He doesn't give me water. 
 Okay. 
 Has he hit you? 
 [Breathes shakily] 
 I don't want to get in trouble. 
 You won't. I promise. Tell me the truth. 
 I'm so scared. 
 That's probably why you've been vomiting. 
 [Whimpers] 
 Tell me the truth. He can't hurt you anymore. 
 He burns me every night with his cigarettes. 
 [Sobs] 
 He threw me across the room. 
 That's what happened to my arm. 
 Please, don't make me go back there. 
 Okay. Shh. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] Please! 
 Okay, okay. 
 Shh. 
 [Grunting] 
 Patient seizing in bed 6! 
 I need 1 of Ativan now! 
 Okay. All right, Brody. 
 Okay, Brody. Just breathe. 
 [Grunting] 
 Just breathe. 
 Grace! 
 Dr. Adams. 
 Just finishing our post-op. 
 Dr. Campbell does not believe these are my old legs. 
 [Laughing] Oh. Well, I'll just have to set him straight. 
 Roseline is doing much better than expected. 
 She's got a great spirit. 
 Yeah, and she seems to like you, too. 
 What about you? 
 [Chuckles] Do I like you? 
 Do you like Schubert? 
 I have tickets to the philharmonic this Saturday. 
 Roseline, ready for our post-op? 
 Dr. Campbell beat you to it. 
 Of course he did. 
 I better get going. 
 Dr. Adams, let me know about the concert this weekend. 
 Hey, Luke. 
 Is my dad coming to see me? 
 Not yet. 
 How is he? 
 Well, he suffered a gastric hernia, so he's still critical. 
 A hernia doesn't sound that bad. 
 His stomach translocated to his chest and required a massive revision to his diaphragm, so next few hours will tell us a lot. 
 What are you guys talking about? 
 That's a lot of fancy words to say we're trying to do everything we can for your dad. 
 Can we go home tonight? 
 Oh, sweetheart... 
 I didn't ask  you. 
 Your dad is still very sick, Luke. 
 Why can't you make him better? 
 Well, that's what we're trying to do, son. 
 How's he doing, Jesse? 
 This one? Like a champ. 
 His last set of hemoglobins came back steady. 
 Good. That's good. 
 We want to keep an eye on your spleen, just to make sure that everything's okay. 
 I'm sure your dad wants to see you, too. 
 Best thing you can do for him right now is to be strong. 
 Leslie's gonna stay with you for a little... don't want her with me! 
 I'll just sit here quietly... 
 No! Go away! 
 You're not in my family! I don't  want  you in my family! 
 Don't you think I care about your dad, too? 
 That I love him, too? 
 I'm sorry that upsets you so much. 
 Luke, I know a lot of grown-ups are talking to you, and that can get confusing. 
 I just want you to know that everybody's trying to help you, son. 
 I guess you don't want a new mom, huh? 
 No. 
 Yeah, I wouldn't want one, either. 
 But you know what I can always use? 
 A friend. 
 Maybe if you think of her like that... 
 Just a thought. 
 Ow! 
 Oh! Ohh! 
 What the hell's going on? 
 She crashed outside the scanner. 
 W... what does that mean, she crashed? 
 What does that mean?! 
 [Groans] 
 Hey, listen, somebody get Harbert or Rorish here right now! 
 I'll page them again. 
 [Groans] 
 Get me the ultrasound and an I-stat. 
 Risa : I think she's bleeding internally. 
 Oh, god! It's like a knife in my belly! 
 Oh, please, help me! Please! 
 I need 2 liters N.S. wide-open through two 18s. 
 Confirm type and screen was sent. 
 Thanks. What's the story, Malaya? 
 Mrs. Stein, 43. Came in with increasing abdominal pain. 
 Crumped in the C.T. 
 Past medical problems? 
 None. This is crazy. She's healthy. 
 What the hell is happening? 
 Excuse me, excuse me. 
 Oh, Ed. Please, come on. 
 Do something, please. 
 Leanne, labs, imaging? 
 Crashed before C.T. 
 U-preg? 
 Test didn't come back yet. 
 Uh, ultrasound now, please. 
 [Gasping] 
 Okay. Her uterus is empty, but... 
 What's wrong?! 
 You  are  pregnant, Susan. 
 It's ectopic. 
 Ohhh! 
 W... w... what is that? What is that? 
 The embryo has planted itself on the ovary. 
 No, no, no. It's worse, I'm afraid. 
 It's ruptured, and it's bleeding. 
 Susan : Ohh! 
 Susan... 
 Get out! 
 Leanne : Shh. 
 What? 
 I don't want you here! 
 I'm not the one who did this, okay? You decided... 
 Son of a bitch! Get out, get out! 
 Mrs. Stein, lay down, please. Mr. Stein, you need to... 
 I'm not going anywhere. That is my wife, okay? 
 And it's  my  patient right now, and I'm asking you to leave. 
 Ed, I paid for this wing, okay?! 
 Got it? 
 Let's go. Let's get her up to the O.R. 
 Woman : Yes, Doctor. 
 It's okay. Just breathe. 
 Let's get her up to O.R., please. 
 Watch her back. 
 Okay, calm down. Just breathe. 
 [Door opens] 
 Is she okay? 
 She's out of surgery. 
 Is she okay? 
 She's still asleep. 
 The next few hours are critical. 
 Well, I want to see her. 
 I'm sorry, but... 
 Where is she? Take me to her right now. 
 The last thing she said before she lost consciousness was that she didn't want you there. 
 Leanne, she was angry. 
 The law says he can't see her until she says otherwise. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Sandy : Thank you for doing this. 
 Sure. 
 It's still really hurting. 
 Strange. Lidocaine usually knocks out the pain. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 I don't know why it's not... 
 [flatline] 
 No pulse. 
 No pulse. Hannah, the crash cart! 
 1 of epi. Slam it now. 
 She's in arrest? What the hell happened? 
 What did you do? Hannah, give me the bag. 
 It's got to be an allergy. I was giving her Lidocaine. 
 She went into anaphylaxis. 
 2%... that's too much. Excuse me. 
 It's not an allergy. It's toxicity. 
 What? No. It's an allergic reaction. I gave her epi. 
 Epi's not gonna work. Hannah, I need intralipid. 
 Intralipid? 
 That's what I said... now. 
 It'll bind to the excess Lidocaine. 
 Hannah, bolus, then drip. 
 Mario, start compressions. I'll secure the airway. 
 Come on. 
 Hannah, you in? 
 Press it. 
 Mario, stop compressions. Pulse check. 
 [Beeping slows] 
 Strong pulse. 
 Yep. 
 Welcome back, Sandy. 
 Hey. Angus, wait up. 
 Hey. You want to get a slice after work? 
 I'm, uh, just too amped to go home. 
 What's up with you? 
 [Water running] 
 Uh, I'm crushing it. 
 That's what's up with me. 
 Did you see the save I just had? 
 [Water stops] 
 I'm sorry. Let me be more specific. 
 The most  recent  save I had? 
 I'm sorry... didn't have such a great view after you shoved me out of the way. 
 Oh, sorry. I didn't even notice. I was just so amped. 
 Amped? 
 Look, we all make mistakes, okay? Don't be embarrassed. 
 Still a good team, though, right? 
 Right? 
 Right. 
 Craig. Come on in. 
 Who are you? 
 Officer Combs. I need to talk to you. 
 Why? What else did he tell you? 
 A lot. 
 I'm warning you... don't trust this kid. 
 We just need to understand what happened. 
 He's messing with them. That's what's happening. 
 What about the burns on his arms? 
 How do you think he got those? 
 We had an issue with him smoking cigarettes. 
 He's been smuggling them in. 
 Maybe he's burning himself. They do all sorts of things. 
 I got cutters you name it. 
 He came in badly dehydrated. 
 He's been vomiting, having seizures. 
 That's often connected. 
 Well, if he's dehydrated, maybe he's not drinking water. 
 He said that you were withholding water and food from him. 
 He says a lot of things. 
 Why do you think he's at this camp? 
 He's lied his whole life. 
 Call his parents. Ask them. 
 They're in Europe. We haven't heard back yet. 
 Okay. You're free to go for now. 
 [Door opens] 
 That's it? 
 [Door closes] 
 So this guy just gets to walk? 
 I talked to Harbert about the nurses. 
 And? 
 This isn't the year for it, Jesse. 
 Yeah, they always say that. 
 Well, I looked at the budget. 
 It's just not doable right now. 
 "Nurse" comes from the word "nourish." 
 Did you know that? 
 You develop the plan, write the orders. 
 We have your back. 
 We double-check your doses, cover your mistakes. 
 We don't Work for you, Leanne. 
 We  are  you. 
 Your care depends on us. 
 You think I don't know that? 
 Can I ask you one thing? 
 You fight for us? 
 Of course I did. 
 'Cause the Leanne that I know doesn't lose a fight. 
 What room is he in? 
 He's right in there. 
 Uh, you guys go in. I already saw him. 
 Dad! 
 Luke. 
 [Voice breaking] You look really bad. 
 Well, you don't look so good yourself, kid. 
 I love you. 
 What are you doing out here? 
 Uh, trying to get the insurance company to pay for his extended stay. 
 Mm. 
 He's gonna be here for like a month, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Anyway...  they needed some time alone. 
 I hear you're getting married in a week. 
 Oh. [Laughs] Not next week anymore. 
 Uh, it's no big deal. 
 It was gonna be really small. 
 You know... 'cause...  Luke's not on on board yet, so Ben didn't want to freak him out with a big wedding, and... 
 [Breathes shakily] I'm sorry. 
 Oh, hey, come on. It's okay. It's okay. 
 You know, I get it. 
 His mother died four years ago. 
 I just can't find a way in. 
 I don't know how we're ever gonna become a family. 
 [Chuckles] Maybe I should go to a zombie convention. 
 [Laughs] Maybe you should. 
 Look, he's... he's just a kid. 
 Words are not gonna help. 
 It's not his  brain  you have to convince. 
 It's his  heart. 
 Play around with him in the sandbox. 
 It's okay if he ignores you. 
 But whatever you do, don't give up on him, okay? 
 That's the only way you're gonna fail him. 
 [Thud, rattle] 
 Guthrie : I need a gurney! 
 He suddenly collapsed. 
 Ben : Luke! Luke, Luke. 
 Uh, Jesse, page the O.R. again. 
 We need surgery down here now. 
 What's happening to him? 
 He's in shock. His spleen is bleeding. 
 He needs surgery. 
 Damn it, this kid has no access. 
 Here's your I.O. drill. 
 Thank you. 
 Ready? 
 [Drill whirs] 
 Is that Mr. Barton's son? 
 What happened? 
 Splenic laceration, decompensated. 
 Pressure's in the 70s. We've got blood and fluids running. 
 He needs to go up. 
 I can clear O.R. 3. 
 Notify the charge nurse, Dr. Pinkney. 
 But what about Campbell? He needs to sign off. 
 He hasn't been returning my pages. 
 I don't care. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 Pack him up. He's going to the O.R. now. 
 [Air hissing] 
 [Monitors beeping] 
 Neal : Faster, please. 
 Bougie, please. 
 Dr. Hudson... 
 Suction, please. 
 What's going on in there? 
 This is a child. 
 He's lost a liter of blood... a child who couldn't wait another second for a surgeon. 
 [Door opens] 
 What's your plan? 
 My plan is to provide what he needs... a splenectomy. 
 Fire me if you want, but the boy needed a surgeon, and he got one. 
 Well, he's got one  now. 
 Dr. Pinkney, please move over. 
 Suture. 
 I'm not going to fire you. 
 You had to start without me. I get it. 
 Tie here and cut. 
 Yes, you. Tie it. 
 I've endured your patronizing tone, your pointless tests, and your continued attempts to humiliate me. 
 Oh, so you think you've been tested? 
 I've been tested by Leanne Rorish. 
 You'll never come close. 
 She's a great doctor. 
 But she's not a surgeon. 
 I see. 
 No, you  don't  see. 
 Emergency medicine is blue-collar work. 
 So I've been told. 
 It's nothing to be ashamed of. 
 Down there, it's all about the first 10 minutes. 
 Stop the bleeding, plug the holes, and do it all fast enough to keep them alive. 
 See, but up here, precision is what matters. 
 Down there, it's all about bougies and sutures and duct tape. 
 In here, it's about hands. 
 Hands? 
 Yeah. 
 So far, all you've shown me are the hands of a carpenter. 
 What I'm waiting to see is if you have the hands of an artist. 
 Suture. 
 [Grunting] 
 He won't stop seizing. Did he get the Ativan? 
 Yes. Just pushed it. 
 He's been seizing? 
 Multiple times. 
 His workup's been normal, though, right? 
 Electrolytes, tox? 
 Yeah. All normal. 
 I've been giving him Ativan for the seizures. 
 [Muffled grunting] 
 Hannah, get the Keppra. 
 I got an airway kit ready. I think we need to intubate. 
 Hold on. 
 [Grunting] 
 Brody, you can stop seizing now. 
 What are you doing? 
 Brody, stop seizing now. You're not fooling anyone. 
 If your seizures were real, then your hand would have hit your face. 
 Google it. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 I can't believe you're saying this. 
 What are you accusing me of? 
 So, what'd you take to make yourself vomit? 
 Ipecac? Saltwater? 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Eye drops. 
 Makes your heart rate go up, too. 
 Google it. 
 I love the Ativan, by the way. Hell of a high. 
 Why would you do this? 
 Why not? 
 You accused an innocent man of abusing you. 
 Yeah, nobody's innocent, Doc. 
 Yeah, nice try. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Brody? 
 Sat is 80%. 
 Come on. 
 He has no gag. Get the airway. 
 How much Ativan did you give him? 
 10 milligrams. 
 10? That's a horse's dosage. 
 I thought he was in refractory seizures. 
 Grab the flumazenil. 
 Wait. 
 Just wait. Wait. 
 [Beeping slows] 
 Sats rising. 
 [Sighs] 
 How did you know he was faking? 
 I spent a year in Haiti. 
 I know what a kid living on rice and water looks like. 
 It's not him. 
 I remember what it was like to be a resident. 
 I would have treated him for seizures, too. 
 [Scoffs] 
 All right. Looks good. 
 [Sighs] 
 You okay? 
 I can't believe I almost got a kid killed today. 
 I think I let her get under my skin. 
 You know, she's not your enemy, Christa. 
 Go ahead. It's okay. 
 When is she gonna wake up? 
 The anesthesia should wear off soon. 
 She's cold. 
 She's comfortable. 
 [Sighs] 
 We bought furniture three different times... three different cribs... three changing tables. 
 Each time, we were so excited. 
 And each time, I had to have somebody come and take the furniture away. 
 The more we tried and failed, the more irritated I got. 
 I just wanted it to stop already, but she... 
 [Smooches] 
 ... just refused to. 
 Instead of making me proud, proud of how damn determined she was... 
 I hated her for it. 
 Listen, Robert, you can't do this to yourself. 
 When she wakes up, she's gonna be devastated that she lost another one. 
 [Sniffles] 
 The last one. 
 Or... 
 Maybe losing the last one is the best thing that could have happened to you both. 
 Look at you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 When is the last time you held her hand like that? 
 You love her. 
 Maybe you forgot that. 
 I do. I really do. 
 [Sighs, smooches] 
 But it's too late. I lost her. 
 Robert. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Drowsily] Robbie? 
 Hey. 
 I love you, too. 
 Ohh! 
 Mm. 
 I love you, honey. 
 Mm. I'm here. 
 Mm. 
 [Sniffles] 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 So...  that's  how it works. 
 The laws don't apply to the V.I.P.s? 
 He's not a V.I.P. right now. 
 No. 
 You're right. He's not. 
 You should come down here more often. 
 It's not the same, is it? 
 Up there, it's all... 
 Budgets and numbers and charts. 
 Down here, it's people. 
 ♪ 
 [Siren wailing] 
 [Radio chatter] 
 That's the bite that turned you. 
 Turned me where? 
 You can't become a zombie unless you get bitten by one first. 
 Everybody knows that. 
 Sorry. 
 So, what's next? 
 Bullet wound to the brain? 
 No. Then you'd be dead. 
 But I  am  dead. 
 No, you're  undead. 
 If you destroy the brain, then the zombie's  dead  dead. 
 You can't be  dead  dead. 
 Zombie 101. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You know, I got to admit, this was a first for me. 
 Well, at least we didn't make you dress up, right? 
 [Laughs] 
 Wow! You look great. 
 Thanks. 
 So does your mother. 
 She's not my mother. 
 She's my friend. 
 You guys ready? 
 Ben : Yep. 
 Whoa. You went total brain-eater. 
 Yeah. 
 This is gonna be so cool. 
 You got the ring? 
 Yep. 
 Okay. Showtime. 
 You nervous? 
 A little. [Chuckles] 
 Thanks for everything. 
 You got it, living-dead person. 
 Let's go. Come on. 
 You look beautiful. 
 Jesse and I did that. 
 Well, shall we begin? 
 We shall. 
 You ready? 
 Jesse : Ready, ready. 
 Guthrie : We are gathered here to join Ben Barton and Leslie Garcia together as husband and wife. 
 The family of Ben and Luke will not change. 
 It'll just get bigger.
