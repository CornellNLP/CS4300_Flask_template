 Sorry for the bumps. 
 Traffic's backed up for 20 miles. 
 This is the only way to the accident site. 
 There should be a few medics and EMTs, but we may be the only doctors on site. 
 Keep your heads on. 
 There's gonna be a lot of people there who need your help. 
 This is not first come, first served. 
 Your primary job on initial eval is to prioritize the patient. 
 Each of you take a packet of tags. 
 There are four colors. 
 Green is for minor injuries, yellow is for more serious injuries, but not immediately life-threatening. 
 Red is for critical patients who won't survive without treatment and transport. 
 The black tag is for death or expected death. 
 Wait, "expected death"? 
 Are you saying we put a black tag on a living patient? 
 You want us to decide who lives and dies? 
 We want you to decide whose life you can save. 
 And prevent the next doctor or EMT who comes along from spending precious time on an unsalvageable patient. 
 There's nothing in your training that's prepared you for this. 
 Do it right and you'll save more lives than you lose. 
 Driver : We're here.

 That back there. 
 All right, let's unload our gear. 
 Hello, folks. Welcome to the zone. 
 Sorry, who are you? 
 D.I.C., doctor in charge. 
 I'm the guy they send out to all these train wrecks. 
 Car wrecks. Whatever. 
 I just got off the phone with a Gina Perello. 
 She said I have two attendings, four E.R. rez, and one surgical rez... Who's the surgical? 
 Heather Pinkney. 
 I'm a surgeon, as well. 
 We usually keep one in the tent, one in the field. 
 You're gonna be the roamer. 
 You must be Dr. Rorish. You're gonna be here with me. 
 I'm better in the field. 
 You're now in my E.R., Dr. Rorish. 
 If I say you're in the tent, you're in the tent. 
 I need all this blood organized by type. 
 The rest of you, bags and tags. 
 Let's move, folks. 
 Oxygen tanks upright! 
 You good, Leanne? 
 Yeah. You go ahead. Keep your wits about you. 
 Good luck. All right? 
 See you on the other side. 
 That guy's vest is missing a "K." 
 Where are the gurneys that I asked for to be lined up here? 
 Dr. Larson, over here. I've got the driver. 
 We're doctors. 
 I got the passenger. 
 Help us! Please! 
 Please, help us! 
 It's okay. We got you. 
 My arms are broken. 
 Can you hear me? 
 His head... His head hit the window hard. 
 His breathing is labored. He's non-responsive... 
 Are you a doctor? 
 I'm a hospice nurse. Alice Sellers. 
 How is he? Please, help him. 
 Is he your husband, Alice? 
 No, his name is Fred. 
 His name is Fred. We were at dinner. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 He's my date. 
 Alice. 
 Yeah. 
 I need to examine you. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Do you have any other injuries? 
 [ Groans ] My right arm. My right foot is broken. 
 Ow. Ow. 
 Multiple fractures. Suspect intraperitoneal bleed. 
 Ow! 
 Hemorrhagic shock. 
 Is... is he okay? 
 I'm so sorry, Alice. 
 Wha... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 What? What? No! 
 Let's get this lady back to triage, please! 
 I know what a black tag is. 
 No, don't black-tag him. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 He's still breathing! 
 He's still breathing! 
 Man : Police and fire rescue teams are hindered in getting to the accident site by the heavy fog and the traffic gridlock all around it. 
 Are my people on site yet? 
 Just arrived. 
 Man : Angels base, 911 dispatch. 
 I have a call from the scene. 
 Sounds like a kid. I'm gonna transfer her. 
 Uh, no, no. That... that goes to 911. 
 We only talk to medics. 
 She sounds isolated. 
 Can't quite make out what she's saying. 
 Says her mom's in bad shape. 
 You start talking to patients directly and you're going down a rabbit hole... trust me. 
 Girl : Hello? 
 Is anybody there? 
 Uh... hello. 
 This is Dr. Perello at Angels Memorial Hospital. 
 What's your name? 
 [ Switch clicks ] Lily. 
 My mom and my brother are back... 
 [ Static ] 
 And we... the car swerved and we went over the... 
 Lily, I'm having trouble hearing you, sweetheart. 
 We have doctors there. They're wearing yellow vests. 
 It's cold and... I can't see anything. 
 All right. Lily, where are you, honey? 
 [ Static ] 
 Lily.

 Hello? 
 Can you still hear me?

 Look at that fog. Can't see 10 feet. 
 Heavy fog conditions... 
 When it lifts and they start bringing people back here, all hell's gonna break loose downstairs. 
 Be ready. 
 Now, so far, we only have... 
 You know, Jesse, the nurses have been talking. 
 They said that your, uh... your discharge has been approved. 
 Your labs are all back. They're normal. 
 Even if that was true, that's private information. 
 Those nurses shouldn't be flapping their traps. 
 Is it hot in here? 
 No. No, and calm down. 
 Look, it's just because we miss you. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Ah, I did a lap. 
 Feel like I just built the pyramids. [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 Oh. 
 Hi. 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Amy, my roommate, Jack Rhodes. 
 Hello. 
 Amy and I, we work together. 
 Work friends, huh? 
 Well, then I wish I was a little better dressed for our first date. 
 You would've totally scored. 
 Oh, I like her. 
 [ Monitor beeping ] 
 Jesse, you okay, man? 
 My chest is feeling a little tight. 
 Jesse. 
 Should we call a doctor? 
 Talk to me. Are you having any pain? 
 I'm feeling nauseated and dizzy. 
 Just try... try to slow down your breathing, okay? 
 I think you're hyperventilating. 
 This can't be happening again. 
 It's not. 
 I want you to breathe with me, all right? 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Four slow beats in. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Four slow beats out. Good. 
 Look at me. You see me? 
 You're okay. It's not a heart attack. 
 It's a panic attack. 
 Okay. 
 [ Breathes deeply ] Keep breathing. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Man : Over here. Bring her over here. 
 Abdomen is tense. Cap refill delayed. 
 [ Crying ] Please go back! 
 BP is 60 over 40. 
 I need a portable ultrasound, please. 
 He was breathing. 
 His pupils were non-responsive. 
 Alice is a hospice nurse. 
 My aunt was a hospice nurse. 
 And my mother used to always say she had one hand in heaven. 
 All right. We've got free fluid in the abdomen. 
 Central line and fluids should stabilize for transport. 
 [ Sobbing ] He was alive. They black-tagged him! 
 They killed him! You killed him! 
 Dr. lorenson, it's time for you to go. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 It's not easy. 
 [ Alice crying ] 
 All right. Just breathe. 
 Okay. Come right this way. Go to the orange tent. 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 [ Car horn honks ] 
 What the hell? 
 [ Siren wails ] 
 Is anybody in there? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Aah! Aah! Get me out of here! 
 Help me! 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Help me! Get me out of here! I can't... I can't breathe! 
 Okay. Okay. Okay. What's your name? 
 Kenny Wylar. Get me out of here. Please get me out of here! 
 Kenny, I'm Dr. Leighton, and I'm gonna help you, okay? 
 Are y-you alone in here? 
 It's just... me and Olaf. 
 A doll for my daughter. 
 She's gonna get upset if I can't get him back to her. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Kenny... Kenny, she's gonna be more upset if we don't get you back, okay? 
 Let's start with that. 
 [ Groans ] I can't breathe. 
 Stay with me. Stay with me. 
 Okay. 
 Mario! Heather! 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Cellphone ringing ] 
 [ Cellphone beeps ] 
 Gina : Hi. It's Gina. 
 A little girl called in before. Her name is Lily. 
 Sounded like her family was in pretty bad shape. 
 There's a lot of that out here, unfortunately. 
 I told her I'd send help. 
 She's in an S.U.V. She said it went over. 
 Went over? Went over what? 
 I don't know. That's all I could make out. 
 Listen, if you find her... 
 Yeah, okay. I'll look for her. 
 Okay. 
 Just let me know, all right? 
 She sounded pretty freaked out. 
 I'm not surprised. 
 It's pretty freaky out here. 
 [ Door rattles ] 
 I can't breathe. 
 Mario : What the hell's this? 
 Angus : It's jammed. 
 Can't breathe. 
 Okay, we need a crow bar or an ax or something. 
 Think we can dig him out? 
 Sure. 
 If we had five hours, maybe. 
 Doc, I-I'm freezing. I-I can't feel my legs. 
 [ Kenny groans ] 
 Person : Somebody help! 
 [ Truck horn blares ] 
 Help me, please. 
 All right, Kenny... Kenny, we're gonna be right back. 
 Stay with me, Kenny. 
 We got no choice. We got to black-tag him. 
 Wait, what?! 
 Wow, what a hero. 
 This is the job, okay? 
 Prioritize based on who we can reasonably save. 
 We can save him. 
 No, we can't. 
 That concrete is cold, wet, and is expanding as it dries. 
 So he either asphyxiates or he freezes to death. 
 Either way, we're not gonna get him out of there in time. 
 You have a black heart. 
 I don't have a black heart, okay? 
 Mario, he's talking and conscious. 
 He's not a black tag. 
 Thank you, Heather. 
 Then what are we gonna do, huh? 
 We fight the hypothermia. 
 You go back to that fire truck... 
 It's about a half a mile back... And get an ax. 
 Hi, Kenny. 
 Yeah, and how are you gonna fight the hypothermia? 
 We'll figure it out. 
 Run, Forrest, run! 
 Okay. How are we gonna keep him warm? 
 It's not like we can put a sun blanket around him. 
 Not around him, in him. Open that bag. 
 I've got saline. 
 We need warm saline, and lots of it. 
 Yeah, well, where are we gonna get warm saline out here? 
 Uh, we need a car that works. 
 You think you're driving somewhere? 
 No, we're not driving. 
 Bingo. 
 Okay, Kenny? 
 Yeah? 
 Kenny, we'll be right back, okay? 
 No! 
 Heather, let's go. 
 [ Car beeping softly ] 
 [ Siren wails ] 
 Child : Help. 
 Is anyone there? 
 Can you help me? 
 Hey. Hey. Hey, it's okay. 
 It's okay. I'm a doctor. I'm gonna help you, okay? 
 My mom... 
 She's trapped. 
 Whoa. Okay. 
 Okay. 
 [ Man shouts indistinctly ] 
 Angus : Kenny... 
 Here. 
 We're gonna run this I.V. wide open into your veins to keep you as warm as possible until we can figure something out, okay? 
 You're not gonna get me out of here, are you? 
 Yes, we are. 
 [ Groans ] 
 I want to talk to my family. 
 Do you have a phone? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, I need a volunteer to hold this I.V. 
 Here. 
 Where are you going? 
 We need to go treat more people. 
 This saline bag takes 12 minutes to empty. 
 We'll be back by then, okay? 
 Kenny. Kenny, look at me. Do not give up. 
 Keep moving in there, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Meet you back here in 12? 
 You got it. 
 Thanks. 
 8 years old. 
 Disoriented and short of breath. 
 Lost consciousness, but coming out of it. 
 Ribs could be fractured. Possible internal bleed. 
 I'm Dr. Rorish. What's your name? 
 Jason. 
 My mom... You have to help her. 
 Jason says his mom's trapped in the car somewhere. 
 I told her I'd get help. 
 I got lost. 
 Two broken ribs. 
 One possibly punctured the right lung. 
 [ Siren wails ] 
 Jason, we're gonna have to get you back to the hospital so that we can help you. 
 No! 
 Shh. 
 I'm not leaving without my mom! 
 You've got to find her! 
 We have one more for that bus, please! 
 I'm not leaving! You've got to find her! 
 This rig is shipping out now. 
 Just wait! 
 Jason, if your mom were here, she'd want you on that ambulance. 
 I'm not leaving without her! Let me up! 
 Hey. Jason, what does your mom's car look like? 
 Hmm? 
 Silver Dodge. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 It has a bumper sticker... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 That says "my dog's not fat, it's a Husky." 
 [ Chuckling ] Okay, good. 
 You are going to that hospital. 
 And we are gonna find your mom. 
 What's her name? 
 Connie.

 You promise you're gonna find her? 
 Man : Ready to go! 
 Yeah. 
 Man 2 : Wait, wait, wait We're getting one more. 
 I promise.

 When we find her, we're gonna take her to the same hospital where you are.

 Excuse me, I have a pregnant patient over there. 
 Nobody's checking her in. 
 Well, unless that baby's about to fall out or take my job, she'll have to wait a minute. 
 Carla? 
 Friend of yours? 
 Sure is. 
 Carla used to be a resident here. 
 So, what's going on? 
 Passed out in a store. 
 Some do-gooder called 911. 
 Oh, I hate the do-gooders. 
 California's full of them. That and kale. 
 Gina Perello, E.R. director. 
 Carla Niven. 
 Malaya's old girlfriend Carla. 
 Congrats on the baby. 
 Bummer on the cancer. 
 Thank you. 
 I like her. 
 Well, she's got her own style, that's for sure. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 So, what were you doing when you passed out? 
 I was buying an ice cream. 
 I didn't even get to eat it. 
 Will you do an ultrasound first? 
 I want to make sure the cargo's okay before you check out the plane. 
 You got it. 
 Come on. 
 Woman : Help! 
 [ Panting ] 
 [ Woman coughing ] 
 Help! 
 Where the hell's Mario? 
 I don't know, but this is our last bag of saline. 
 [ Banging ] 
 Please! I can't get out! 
 I can't move! 
 [ Sobbing ] 
 My leg! 
 It's broken! 
 I don't have time to stabilize the fracture. 
 Just get me out of here! 
 This is gonna hurt like hell. 
 [ Screaming ] 
 [ Rapid beeping ] 
 That thing got a short or what? 
 It keeps going off. 
 No. 
 I adjusted the levels a little, that's all. 
 I set it up so it can warn me slightly ahead of any problems. 
 Anxiety is totally normal after a heart attack. 
 I don't have anxiety. 
 I'm just being careful, that's all. 
 Thing's gonna give me a panic attack in a minute. 
 It wasn't a panic attack. 
 It was an aftershock. 
 Oh. 
 You mean like after an earthquake? 
 All right. 
 I am gonna go flirt with the nurses. 
 I'm terrible at it, so if you want to be my wing, you'll come hang, huh? 
 How many times have you fallen? 
 Uh, just a few. 
 Five or six, maybe. 
 Any nausea, vomiting? 
 Yeah. But, you know, that's... 
 That's just morning sickness, I'm sure. 
 Yeah. 
 Carla, look. 
 Mm. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Excuse me. I have a C.T. open for you. 
 V.I.P. treatment. 
 Thank you. 
 Kenny : [ Shivering ] Doctor... 
 I-I'm not gonna make it. 
 I know I'm not gonna make it. 
 I wa... I want the phone, please. 
 I want... I want to... I want to talk to my family. 
 I want to say goodbye to my... 
 I want to say goodbye to my daughters. 
 [ Dialing ] 
 [ Ringing ] 
 Girls : Hi! 
 [ Giggling ] You've reached the Wylar family! 
 We can't come to the phone right now... 
 So leave a message at the beeeep!

 Sw-sweetheart, it's daddy again. 
 I-I... I'm... I'm leaving you another message. 
 I-I, um... 
 I...want to say that I love you. 
 I love you very much. 
 I love you with all my heart. 
 I want you to live your life knowing that you were loved. 
 Just know that, okay? 
 Damn it, Mario. 
 Mario : Angus! 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Heather! 
 Whoo! [ Laughs ] 
 I have never been happier to see you. 
 He'll call you back. [ Beep ] 
 This is all I could get off the truck. 
 What took you so long? 
 Had to save a woman from a burning car. 
 That's right. Deal with it. 
 One, two, three. 
 [ Car creaking, all grunting ] 
 Almost, almost. Come on.

 Three! 
 I don't want to die in here!

 Nice and easy. Nice and easy. 
 Okay, we got you. We got you. You're good. 
 Okay. You're good.

 Make sure not to move that. I'll find you some water. 
 
 
 
 Silver Dodge with a bumper sticker that said "my dog's not fat, it's a Husky." 
 Have you seen anything like it? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 Okay. Well, if you find it, come back and get me, okay? 
 I saw that car. There was a woman inside. I black-tagged her. 
 What were her injuries? 
 Unconscious, pulse was weak and thready, huge laceration to her left leg. Catastrophic blood loss. 
 Why the black tag? 
 Because she isn't gonna make it. 
 Dr. Rorish, it was the right call. 
 Malaya, where's the car? 
 About 200 yards down in the number-three Lane. 
 But... 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 I'm going to check on a patient. 
 You heard your resident. She's a black tag. 
 No offense to Dr. Pineda, but I can't rely on a first-year resident's eval on this one. 
 I promised the boy. 
 Promises to little boys don't hold water in the zone. 
 Out here, we treat patients under strict protocol. 
 Put your bag down. Now. 
 I don't report to you. 
 Actually, you do. And if you disobey me out here, you're in violation of state and federal law. I will have you arrested right here, right now. 
 Are we really gonna let this... guy tell us who to treat and how to treat them? 
 I can go check again. Maybe I wasn't thorough enough. 
 No, Malaya. You stay here. 
 [ Woman screaming, man yells indistinctly ] 
 All right, Malaya. I got it. 
 Hold down the fort.

 Jesse. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Dr. Carla Niven! 
 Always glad to see you. Just not glad to see you here. 
 What's going on? 
 [ Scoffs ] I'm old news. 
 What's up with you? 
 Uh, I'm getting a 2-D echo. 
 Heart attack. 
 No way. When'd that happen? 
 A week ago, eight days. 
 Eight days ago? You have any complications? 
 A few bloops and bleeps. 
 No complications. 
 Listen, you should be discharged by now. 
 Who's the idiot who ordered the 2-D echo? 
 You can't be too careful, you know. 
 Oh, so you're the idiot? You ordered your own test? 
 23% of people who have a first heart attack have a second one. 
 77% don't. 
 I'd kill for those odds. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You know, you always used to say that the flip side of everyone's best quality is their worst quality. 
 You know what your best quality is, don't you, mama? 
 You care. 
 What's my worst? 
 You worry. 
 There's only one prescription for that. Get up. 
 Jesse, didn't we already get a 2-D echo on you last week? 
 Let me guess... 
 It was normal? 
 No, don't listen to her. 
 Don't you dare listen to him. 
 Don't listen to him. 
 Guess what? 
 It's a boy. 
 He's gonna be beautiful. 
 And smart as hell, just like his mommy. 
 Take care. 
 Thank you. 
 Help! Help! I need help! 
 In here! In here! My wife's in here! 
 She's... 
 She landed pretty hard. I can't get her to move. 
 Ma'am? 
 Y-you got to help her. 
 Ma'am, can you hear me? Okay, uh, get me some towels. 
 Something, quick. 
 What is it? 
 We got to roll her, stabilize her. 
 Nice and slow, okay? 
 One, two, three. That's it. 
 Okay. 
 We need to apply pressure. 
 Heather : Mario... 
 Popliteal pulses are weak. 
 Uh, femoral pulse is... 
 The hemorrhaging is catastrophic. 
 Okay, I know, okay, she's lost a lot of blood. 
 This is what we're gonna do. 
 We're gonna focus in on her head. 
 The blood loss has already caused too much damage. 
 Look at her pupils. 
 Man : Why aren't you getting towels? 
 What are you doing? Get some towels. 
 Why aren't you doing something? 
 Man : I need a doctor over here! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Your wife's injuries are too serious. 
 You said you were gonna apply pressure. 
 That's what you just said, right? 
 I did. 
 I was hoping we could apply pressure, but... 
 What, are you just gonna leave her here to die? 
 Sir, what's your name? 
 No, I'm not talking to you. 
 [ Crying ] Please, you have to save my wife. 
 Don't listen to her. Her name is Lisa. 
 She's a pre-school teacher, and nothing ever gets her down. 
 She's the bravest person you will ever meet, and she's going to get through this. 
 Do you hear me? She's gonna make it through this. 
 Man 2 : I got a burn victim! 
 Go. 
 Man : Please! 
 If there was anything we could do, okay, anything, we would. I'm sorry. 
 Please don't leave her! Please, please. 
 She's still breathing! 
 She's everything I have in this world! Please! 
 If you knew how strong she was, you wouldn't be doing this. 
 Not if you knew! Please! 
 Heather : Mario, get out here! 
 I'm sorry. 
 [ Man cries ] 
 Neil : This is it, Leanne. 
 All right. Connie? Hey, Connie, Connie. 
 Can you hear me? 
 Thigh laceration. Significant bleed down here. 
 Okay. 
 She's still got a pulse. 
 Barely. 
 You thinking what I'm thinking? 
 That Malaya made the right call? 
 Did she? 
 No! 
 Okay, Connie. 
 We found your son. 
 He's gonna be all right. 
 [ Stapling ] Okay? You hear me? 
 All he wanted was to take care of you. 
 So we're gonna get you back to him, okay? 
 Leanne, look. This leg wound goes all the way down. 
 I am not gonna tell another kid that his mother's dead. 
 Her foot is completely crushed in this metal. 
 There's no way we're getting it out. 
 We can still get her out. 
 [ Siren wails ] 
 I'll find a saw. 
 Hello?! 
 Can you hear me? 
 I'm a doctor! Can anybody down there hear me?! 
 Girl : Yes! I hear you! I hear you! 
 Please, you have to help us! 
 Is your name Lily? 
 Yes! Yes, it's me, Lily! 
 Please help us! 
 My mom and my brother are badly hurt! 
 [ Branch snaps ] Aah! 
 [ Grunting ] 
 [ Grunting ] 
 Lily : [ Echoing ] Are you okay? 
 Do you need help? 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Normal voice ] Are you hurt? 
 [ Groaning ] 
 Hi, Lily. I'm Dr. Lorenson. 
 Mom! Mom, she's a doctor! 
 Come quick. My mom and my brother are hurt. 
 Okay. 
 What's wrong? 
 I dislocated my shoulder. 
 I'm okay. I'm okay. 
 I'm gonna need your help, though, okay? 
 Can you grab that bag over there for me? 
 Ooh! 
 Are you really a doctor? 
 Yes, I am. 
 But I'm counting on my assistant here to help me. 
 [ Strained ] Lily tried climbing out, but it's too steep. 
 And we tried honking the horn, but it's... 
 What's your name? 
 Broken. 
 Katherine. 
 She hurt her neck, and she can't move her legs. 
 Go check my son, please. 
 I'm okay. Help her. 
 [ Moans ] 
 Okay. Katherine... 
 Listen to me carefully. 
 You fractured your neck when you were thrown from the car. 
 The paralysis you're feeling right now may not be permanent, but it's crucial that you don't move your head one inch. 
 Lily, I need you to grab me something to support your mom's head on either side so she can't move it. Can you do that? 
 Okay. 
 You have a pretty serious head laceration I'm gonna need to stitch up. 
 You've lost a lot of blood. 
 Check on my son. Please. 
 His name is Elliot. 
 Okay. Lie still. 
 Hi, Elliot. 
 My name is Christa. 
 You're having trouble breathing? 
 [ Straining ] A little. My throat hurts. 
 I tried to get up, but my hips hurt too much. 
 Can you say "aah"? 
 Aah... 
 Ah. 
 Feel this popping sensation as I'm pressing onto your skin? 
 Yeah, it's, uh, crackly. 
 Okay. It's called crepitus. 
 It's air from your windpipe leaking into your skin. 
 It means you fractured your trachea. 
 I need you to breathe slowly and try not to talk. 
 [ Gasps lightly ] 
 You've been very brave, but I need you to try and rest your voice now, okay? 
 I assume you don't have a phone? 
 There's no reception. I tried until the battery died. 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Monitor beeping ] 
 Just say it. 
 It's in my brain, isn't it? 
 It's a tumor. 
 Secondary to the leukemia. 
 The swelling around it is pressing on your brain stem. 
 Unfortunately, this is an aggressive type of tumor. 
 I'm afraid it won't be long before it stops your breathing... 
 And then your heart. 
 Carla... 
 I need to be blunt here. 
 If you die with that baby inside of you, there's... 
 What? 
 Well, obviously we need to call O.B. in and induce... 
 No, I'm not dying tonight. 
 That's... that's ri... 
 That's ridiculous. I'm not dying tonight. 
 I have plenty of time left. 
 A-at least let me get you an O.B. consult. 
 Please. 
 Fine. Fine. 
 But I'm not delivering this baby at 30 weeks. 
 Okay? And you're not telling Malaya. 
 She can help you through this, Carla. 
 She's made it perfectly clear that she can't handle it, or she doesn't want to. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 But can you do me a favor? 
 Hmm? 
 Think about it. 
 Man : Shortness of breath. 
 Triage, right now. 
 We intact? 
 Something's wrong. It hurts. 
 Set it right over here. 
 Dr. Pineda, where the hell is Dr. Rorish? 
 I don't know. 
 Do you have a phone? 
 I have to call my sister... back. 
 What you need to do is stop talking. 
 Pulse ox is 90%. 
 Let's get an oxygen mask on her right away. 
 Take slow, deep breaths. 
 She doesn't know where I am. 
 87%. 
 I think she has a pneumo. 
 We're gonna have to get a chest tube in her right away. 
 Do you know how to do that? 
 There's probably shards and fragments of broken bone in there, so it's not gonna be an easy chest tube at all. 
 I think I can do it. 
 Out here, "I think I can" is good enough. 
 Do it. 
 Okay, Amy, what do we got? 
 8-year-old Jason Riner. B.P. 110 over 64. 
 Heart rate 112. 
 Sat'ing high 80s. 
 Nauseous. Vomited three times en route. 
 A doctor said they'd bring my mom here. 
 Jason, I'm Dr. Guthrie. 
 I need you to lie still so that we can make you all better. 
 Seat-belt sign to the abdomen. 
 Possible internal bleeding. 
 My seat belt caused me to bleed? 
 Your seat belt saved your life, son. 
 [ Squirting ] 
 Man : You got it. 
 Good lung slide here. 
 Probable lung contusion, but no pneumo. 
 Jason, we're gonna take you on a ride upstairs so we can take some pictures of your tummy, okay? 
 What if my mom comes in? She won't know where I am. 
 When your mom gets here, I'll come and find you. 
 What's your mom's name? 
 Connie Riner. 
 [ Siren wails ] 
 You ready? 
 As I'll ever be. 
 Soon as you do this, we run her back to triage! 
 Good? 
 Yeah. 
 [ Grunting ] 
 Christa : Okay. Remember how I showed you last time. 
 It's just like tying a shoe. 
 Through this loop, right? 
 Right. 
 Cut when I say. 
 Ready? 
 Ready. 
 And... 
 Now! 
 Got it. 
 [ Elliot gasping ] 
 Elliot? Lily, what's going on? 
 Katherine, don't move. 
 Something's wrong. 
 Christa : Elliot? 
 Calm down. Calm down. Deep breaths. 
 I know you're scared. 
 [ Gasping ] 
 Is he breathing?! 
 Elliot, I need to look down your throat again, okay? 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 Try and relax your throat and jaw as best you can. 
 Is he gonna be okay? 
 Lily, go to your car and see if you can find me a pen. 
 A pen? 
 Yes, an ink one. Hurry! 
 Are you gonna write something? 
 No. 
 I'm gonna try and keep your brother breathing. 
 [ Gasping ] 
 [ Breathing raggedly ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations, radio chatter ] 
 God, where are you guys? 
 Hey, Terrence, I need that ultrasound. 
 Her anatomy shifted from the crash. 
 I can't find my markers. 
 It's in use. Five minutes. 
 She can't wait five minutes! 
 [ Siren wails ] 
 Woman : 18 gauge! 
 Okay. 
 There should be some there! 
 Best guess, then. 
 I'm sorry, Jocelyn. 
 [ Monitor beeps rapidly ] 
 Enough already. 
 [ Beeping stops ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Beeping resumes ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Monitor flatlines ] 
 Jack? 
 Jack, you with me, bro? 
 I need help! Anybody! 
 [ Floor buffer whirring ] 
 I've got a guy coding in here! 
 [ Panting ] 
 [ Device beeping ] 
 Okay. 
 My wife, she's awake! 
 What? 
 She's awake! 
 I tried to tell you, she's strong. 
 For God's sake, hurry. Please. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Please. 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 He's turning blue. 
 Katherine : Oh, God! 
 What's happening? Please don't let him die! 
 [ Crying ] Please don't let my baby die! 
 No one's gonna die. 
 No one's gonna die. 
 I'm gonna make a small hole in his windpipe... 
 In his neck, here... 
 So that we can pass a tube through it that he can breathe through. 
 Thing is, I'm gonna need both hands in order to do it. 
 So I need you to help me push my shoulder back into its socket. 
 I can't do that. 
 Yes, you can. 
 But we need to move fast. Don't think about it. 
 [ Groans ] 
 Okay. Take my wrist. 
 Put your foot under my arm. 
 [ Groans ] 
 Oof. 
 Okay. 
 [ Breathless ] I want you to pull back as hard as you can, like you're opening a door that's stuck. 
 Ready? 
 Okay. 
 [ Groaning ] 
 Sorry. 
 Pull harder. 
 [ Screaming ] 
 [ Monitor flatlining ] 
 I need help, por favor! 
 [ Device beeps rapidly ] 
 I need juice. Juice. 
 Charge. 
 [ Defibrillator charging ] Okay, here we go. 
 Idios mío! 
 [ Electricity zaps ] 
 What the hell? I thought this was V-tach. 
 [ Sighs ] It was. 
 You got him back to sinus rhythm? 
 But you're a patient. 
 I'm a nurse, bro. 
 Always a nurse. 
 Woman : Bring those two over this way. 
 [ Siren wailing ] Man: Here you go. 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 Doing our jobs. Angus, get over here. 
 P.E.A. due to blood loss. 
 Open a central line. 
 Push whatever we've got. She needs fluids. 
 She's seizing. Ativan now, please. 
 There are consequences to your arrogance, doctors. 
 So arrest us. 
 That's not what I mean. 
 This is the consequence of your decision. 
 Pushing ativan now. 
 It's working. 
 This one's getting on that ambulance! 
 Yeah, this one too! 
 Pulse is thready, but it's back. 
 You overstepped, and you countermanded a direct order. 
 Yeah, maybe I did, but I made a medical decision. 
 You made an emotional decision. You see this woman here? 
 Yellow tag when she arrived. 
 I wasn't available to help your resident with a blind chest tube, and now it took longer than it should have. 
 She was deprived of oxygen. She might have brain damage. 
 That was my fault. I couldn't get that tube in. 
 It is not your fault. It's ours. 
 He's right, Leanne. Our math doesn't work. 
 We may have saved Connie, but we did it at the expense of someone else. 
 If that woman doesn't make it, it's on us. 
 Man : [ Shouts indistinctly ] Ready to go! 
 Hey, guys, I need to get on the ambulance now! Come on. 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go! 
 Okay. Sorry to interrupt here, but, uh, nobody's heard from Christa. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, no one's seen her, she hasn't checked in, she hasn't answered her radio. 
 You should go back with Connie. 
 All right. Will do. 
 I'll go and look for Christa. 
 Angus, take over. 
 Okay. Lily, next up, I need you to bite off both ends of the pen. 
 Like this? 
 Okay. And the other side, so it's open like a straw. 
 Got it. 
 We've got to do this now. 
 [ Wheezing ] 
 Have you done this before? 
 Doesn't happen very often. 
 There's gonna be a little blood, okay? 
 Okay. 
 [ Moans softly ] 
 Damn! 
 That's a lot of blood. 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. 
 Lily, hand me the pen. 
 [ Wheezing ] 
 [ Blows ] 
 I see it, I see it! His chest is moving! 
 Okay. Hand me the bag. Let's tape it up. 
 Okay. You take over. 
 Squeeze the bag every 10 seconds. 
 Not too hard. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You did fantastic, Lily. 
 His breath is okay. 
 Your brother is lucky to have such a brave sister. 
 How are my kids? 
 He's stable, and breathing on his own. 
 Lily was a great assistant. 
 She is fearless. 
 How are you feeling? 
 A little cold. 
 Nobody knows we're down here, do they? 
 What if nobody comes? 
 Risa, is triage open? 
 Yes, Dr. Rorish. 
 Get the gurney. 
 Uh, right inside. 
 [ Chatter ] 
 We're being overrun. 
 You're all being called back here now. 
 Look, I haven't heard from Christa yet, and now I'm missing Mario and Heather. 
 I'm not leaving without all of our team. 
 You are not Search and Rescue. You are a doctor. 
 Get back here. 
 [ Cellphone beeps ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Phone slams ] 
 Risa, call upstairs and get me some doctors and nurses down here. 
 Risa : Who am I calling? 
 I don't care if you call Dermatology. 
 We need some help. 
 Help has arrived. 
 I could kiss you right now, Jesse! 
 My heart couldn't take it. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Hey, Jason, listen to me. 
 We had to put a tube in her mouth to help her breathe, so she won't be able to talk. 
 In truth, she won't be able to respond at all. 
 Is she dead? 
 No. She's alive. 
 She fought really hard to get here because she wanted to be here with you. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Thanks. 
 Mom? 
 Mommy? [ Cries ] 
 Mommy, please say something. 
 Please? 
 Jason, they need to take her now. 
 Mommy, I love you. 
 [ Gasps ] 
 [ Gasps ] 
 She can hear me! 
 You can hear me! [ Sniffles ] 
 Mommy, you're gonna be all right. 
 I promise you will. 
 And I'm gonna be waiting for you when you get out. 
 Jason. 
 [ Sniffling ] 
 All right, buddy. 
 [ Crickets chirping ] 
 [ Chatter ] 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 [ Siren wails ] 
 Hospital pharmacy to Trauma ward. 
 Hospital pharmacy to Trauma ward. 
 Man : Yeah, we got broken bones and multiple fractures. 
 Woman : Okay, people, move back. 
 Woman 2 : Keep the pressure up. 
 Man : This one's still stable. 
 Keep him delayed. 
 [ Chatter ] 
 Mario? What are you doing in here? 
 Heather, get out of here. 
 What's going on? 
 Get to work. 
 Help him. Save my wife's life.
