 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Have... have you tried talking to him yet? 
 I did, but he played it off as nothing. 
 Wait, so when you say his hands were shaking, wh... 
 Shh! 
 I'm just trying to understand what happened. 
 I'm telling you, something is wrong with Dr. Guthrie. 
 His hands shake all the time. His charts are illegible and... 
 What's the deal, Breakfast Club? 
 Have you guys seen the news yet? 
 Once again, over 30 inmates injured in a riot here at California State Prison at Arvin. 
 Those prisoners are being taken to hospitals all across the Southland. Let's go, people. We have incoming. Where's Willis? He called in sick today. Let's go. ♪ ♪ [Boat horn blows] Nice to see you again, Ethan. Thanks for coming. The two petty officers who woke me didn't give me much choice. What's going on? [Ship horn blows] At 0600 this morning, a B-586 Kronshtadt,  the Varshavyanka,  surfaced 80 miles off the coast of Los Angeles. Engine room explosion. Did you say a Russian attack sub surfaced in U.S. waters? Nearest Russian ship is three days away. They won't let us tow them in, and they won't let their injured be airlifted. You're not about to suggest I make a house call on a Russian sub illegally patrolling U.S. waters? I got a better idea. Why don't you blow it up? Someone made a trade, and whatever it is must be important or DOD wouldn't have agreed to do this. Why me? You were requested specifically. By the Pentagon? By the Russians. The Chief Medical Officer on board... Dr. Dmitri Volkov. Dmitri. We were in Afghanistan together. [Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [Ship horn blows] What's he doing here? The White House wants this to look like a civilian mission. For that, we need an actual civilian. He's the wrong guy for this. Doesn't have the temperament for it. I'm not surprised you don't like him. I hear he's the boss. Ethan, listen to me. The importance of this was stressed repeatedly. You have to keep Malinovsky alive, and you won't have any support from us. It's just you and your friend. [Inhales and exhales deeply] [Sirens wailing] [Indistinct conversations] These are violent offenders. Keep your head about you. Great day for Campbell to be out. 50-year-old male with penetrating injuries to his flank and upper back. Shank still in place. Woman : I got a V.I.P. for you here. Can you run down his injuries for us, please? I don't know. Bunch of stab wounds and his hand is jacked. Gonna cut you up, Jackie. Third time this week he's promised to do that. Charming. Let's get him into Center Stage. Hey, watch it. Watch your back. [Indistinct conversations] [Grunting] Okay, this is through the fascia. Let's check a F.A.S.T. scan, please. Yes, Doctor. [Groans] Aah! What the hell is that? Sir, I need you to stay still. [Laughs] “sir”? This bitch a lot nicer than you, Jacks! Don't count on it. [Continues grunting] Ah! There is a drawer full of scalpels right there that'll take your arm, or anything else, clean off. [Grunts] Let go. Let go! Come on! Aah! [Groans] You want the Haldol? Yeah, definitely. And Benadryl. Okay, Jackie, let's handcuff both wrists to this side of the bed. That way, he can't thrash around as much. [Grunting] Jesse : Get him over. [Grunting] I'm gonna finish what I started. Black deaths matter, Sonny. [Laughs] I'm gonna tear you up. Oh, I'm shaking in my chains, Damien. Whoa, careful. Those could be in an artery. Ultrasound. A toothbrush? Yeah, he got me with a spoon, too, he always gets a little testy when I'm around. I can't imagine why. [Grunts] Jesse : Hey, hey, hey! Leanne : Let's restrain him now! Coming in. [Grunting] Hey, hey! [Tray clatters] Heather : We need leg restraints! Backing. Easy, easy, easy. Whoa. Pupils are 5 millimeters and sluggish. This one's first for C.T. Is that Hank? Oh, man. He okay? I tried to pull him out, but he fell. Everybody was all over him, Doc. He took a boot to the forehead. Aah! [Monitor beeping erratically] He's posturing. I'll grab the burr hole tray. No, no, no, it's an open fracture. We can pop out the bone directly through the skin. It'll relieve the pressure off his brain. Let me have a bone elevator, please. Ohh, yeah. [Chuckles] This stuff's singin' my song. That should shut you up for a while, buddy. Hold on. It looks like there's something underneath the skin here. Is that... A tooth. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's... that's mine. Someone page dental. [Tooth and instrument clink] [Indistinct conversations] Is there a problem, Dr. Pineda? No. Good. [Indistinct conversations] Uh, vessels are still intact. Probably dropped a lung. Set up for a chest tube. Uh, do we need another guard over here? This is gonna hurt. Don't worry about Sonny. Yeah, don't worry about Sonny. [Exhales sharply] That didn't even penetrate the muscle. Just some soft tissue damage. You're a lucky guy. Yeah, I guess being fat finally pays off. [Chuckles] See? He's a teddy bear. [Indistinct conversations] Jackie, is that your blood? Okay. Let's get him to sides till an O.R. opens up. [Indistinct radio chatter] One minute from target. You're wondering how you got yourself in the middle of a high-stakes international negotiation? [Filtered voice] No, I'm wondering how you did. Maybe it's because I'm the best. Ah. Who's this Dr. Volkov? Combat surgeon. Worked with him in Afghanistan. Good doctor. Then what do they need us for? Been asking myself the same question. Look, don't mess with these people. Three years ago in the Bering straits, the Russians let a submarine sink rather than let an American rescue ship get close. Anatoli Malinowski must be  very  important to Putin. 30 seconds to target. [Beeping] There she is,  the Varshavyanka. [Radio chatter] [Alarm sounding, blades whirring] [Hatch creaks, radio chatter] Squeeze with your right hand to slow down. Don't jump. Just lean back. What happens if I jump? You'll lose your head. What? ♪ ♪ Permission to come aboard, sir? I'm Captain Vasilievsky. Welcome to  the Varshavyanka. ♪ ♪ [Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.] Where's Volkov? You will focus only on the agreed upon task. You will stay within the designated area only. There are consequences for failure to comply. There was explosion in lower engine compartment. Not nuclear. Lieutenant Malinovsky was working in the galley above and was injured. Here he is. [Muffled grunts] Where is Dr. Volkov? Thanks for coming, Ethan. Dmitri. They didn't tell me you were injured. Anything to get out of work. Lieutenant Malinovsky is the priority. I'm fine. Probably a Galeazzi fracture or broken rib or two. Deal with him. We're in a hurry. [Muffled groaning] Sternoclavicular dislocation. This guy's in bad shape. [Siren wailing in distance] [Curtain rings swoosh] Can I roll up your sleeve, please? Yeah. Just texting my daughter Molly. She's watching the news. She's freaking out. I can imagine. You don't scare too easily, do you? Well, I couldn't do the job if I did. Why didn't you let us know you were hurt? Showing weakness to those guys? It's a death sentence. Well... you just became my spirit animal. Can you give your spirit animal a couple of stitches, please? On it. You gotta be tough around here, too, huh? Sometimes. Mm. [Cellphone alert chimes] Molly wants to make sure I'll be at her play tomorrow night. She's playing Juliet at her middle school. Aw. I was in a play once when I was a kid. I was a tree. Didn't have any lines. But my mom sat through every performance. Aw. That's the stuff that matters. Well, tell your daughter that we'll make sure to get you there. [Telephone rings] [Man coughing] There's someone here named Linda. She says she knows you. [Telephone continues ringing] She's my dad's girlfriend. Thanks. [Sighs] Mario... Here's the check. [Telephone ringing] Thank you. I really think you should come. Look, you got what you came for. Now I'm done. I'm gonna stay here until it's time to go, in case you change your mind. I got patients. You should go. [Indistinct conversations] So why did he attack you? Damien's skinheads have had it out for us since the beginning. You should've seen Sonny, though. He wanted to take 'em all on. [Chuckles] Definitely saved my ass. You could've taken 'em all on. Yeah, right. No pneumo on his chest film. Finish stitching him up. Let's get him out. What about his tooth? The dental resident says he'll see him in the clinic tomorrow. Thought it was one inmate per room. Jackie said it was okay, Doc. Arlo and me are real tight. He can't get along without me. Right? [Monitor beeping rapidly] Oh. What's going on? No pulse. V-fib. Do something. Will you help him? Huh? [Defibrillator whines] Angus : Charging. Sonny! Clear! [Grunts] Hang in there! [Whispers] Check him. Sinus. What the hell just happened? His heart stopped. But you said the stab wounds weren't that bad. They weren't. [Alarm beeps] [Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.] Ethan : His clavicle displaced backwards from the sternum. It's pressing on his aorta. It's causing him to crash. Okay, where's the lidocaine? Top shelf, labeled... [speaks Russian] [Groans] Pressure's tanking. He's gonna code. We gotta do this now. I need a towel clamp. Try one of those drawers over there. Maybe you and your men can step out. [Groaning] Or not. B.P.'s down, 34 systolic. [Monitor beeping rapidly] Vasilievsky : You are going to fix right away. Ethan : Shh, shh, shh. [Rapid beeping continues] [Muffled grunt] [Coughing] [Grunting] [Speaking indistinctly, muffled] Relax. We're here to help you. This must've been a huge explosion. Where are the other injured? No other injured. Fix him. Come on, you can do it. It's moving, but I just need more torque. Can you get something in here? Just pull it laterally. [Groaning continues] Hey, you, come here. Hold him. Hold him. Down. Down. [Speaks Russian] [Grunting] Sailor, I'm very sorry about this. Ready? One, two, three. [Clank] Aah! [Groaning] Dr. Rorish, Damien. [Monitor beeping rapidly] Okay. He's seizing. Push 2 of Ativan now. Can you take the cuffs off so we can lay him flat? No way. We need to protect his airway. [Grunting] He's gonna break his wrist. One cuff. [Grunting] Please. [Monitor beeping rapidly] [Grunting] Okay, okay. Got it. [Rapid beeping continues] He's going now. He's gonna need a head C.T. This seizing could be caused by a traumatic brain bleed. Jesse, hang a gram of Dilantin, please. On it. I'm gonna need to call up to Radiology, let 'em know we're on our way. We should clear that area before he goes anywhere. Let's do it. All right. I need a unit available to do a sweep. [Curtain rings swoosh] What's a guy gotta do around here to get 5 of morphine I.V. push? Easy. You got a bad skull fracture. Better give me some Zofran before I puke. Or Reglan. Dealer's choice. You're a doctor? You don't recognize me? I'm not sure if I should be relieved or offended. Malaya, this here is Hank Goldman, “Doctor to the Stars.” Oh, yeah. I remember reading about you a few years ago. That's not how you know me, is it, Rollie? Hank was my resident. It was a long time ago. He was a great doctor... who made a lucrative career out of overprescribing narcotics, until somebody died. And you're telling me that you never gave someone with a bad cut an extra band-aid? That's all I was trying to do. I believe the courts referred to what you did as involuntary manslaughter. You're the same old Guthrie, always by the book. I'm not surprised to see you here working at county. What are you making, 12 bucks an hour? I hear Denny's is paying $15. [Sighs] Ah, you buried the lede, Rollie. Multiple areas of intraparenchymal and intraventricular bleeding. We're already paging neurosurgery for a consult. Don't bother. I know how to read a C.T. I know I'm a goner. Look, I'm really... I'm really sorry, Hank. Is there anybody that you'd like for us to contact? My wife. But don't call collect. She won't accept. How long your hands been shaking like that, Rollie? Tell you what. How about today, you just be the patient? You let me be the doctor. [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [Monitor beeping steadily] [Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.] Why does it take so long? It's a very big cut. It shouldn't take too much longer. [Speaking Russian] I will be back soon. Dr. Volkov is in charge. And they stay here. [Door opens] I think your boss likes me. [Door closes] Maybe we can all go golfing one day. The last time we did that, I almost died. And you should be careful, Comrade. [Chuckles] They don't court-martial people in my country. They shoot them. How many times has he been court-martialed anyway? I think it was only the once. I was joking. You're the gift that keeps on giving, huh? Yes, I was court-martialed, but I was ultimately cleared. You're going to need more suture for that wound. I think we're okay with what we got. No, it needs a multilayer closure. Ethan, I have some extra suture in my cabin. [Speaks Russian] Better safe than sorry, right? Mm-hmm. [Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.] Sure is a long way to his quarters. Just sayin'. [Men shouting indistinctly in distance] [Labored breathing] Jesse, Radiology's ready for Damien. Got it. [Telephone rings] [Curtain rings swoosh] He's gone. [Ring] Leanne! Damien got Jackie! Whoo-hoo-hoo! [Laughing] [Men cheering] Leanne : Jackie? Whoo! Damien got Jackie! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [Laughter] I need some 4x4s, please. [Indistinct conversations] We gotta get her into Center Stage. Some guards in here! Okay, I got a prisoner on the loose! [Alarm buzzing] [All shouting indistinctly] [Police radio chatter] 
 
 Leanne : We need more gauze. Gauze. Gauze. Let's get her into O.R. we gotta take her upstairs. Savetti, Pinkney, over here! Oh, my God. Jackie. Damien did this, didn't he? Mario : Where is he? Leanne : Security's on it. Right now, we need to stop this bleeding. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, we're in lockdown. No one leaves this floor until we find Damien. We  have  to. She needs an O.R. now. That is not happening. No one goes up and no one comes down. There aren't any surgeons down here! You're not leaving. You are a surgeon. You're gonna have to treat her. Let's get her into Center Stage. Jesse : Let's go, guys. Get moving. You get a pulse? She's lost a lot of blood. Let's go. Noa, open up intubation tray, please. I need a hemostat and vessel loops. Flying in. I need a 16 gauge. Watch your back. Leanne : Can you open up the rapid infuser, please? Got it. Blood's on its way. Heather : Leanne... Hey, she's one of us. Mario : Give us some room here. Back off. Leanne : Okay, careful, careful. Focus. Everybody, just focus. We've still got a patient to treat. [Monitor beeping rapidly] [Cellphone rings] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] Phone call from Molly. [Ring] Her daughter. Sew that up. So where is this cabin of yours anyway? Moscow? He'll be back. When all this... happened, you specifically asked for Willis. Why? In all my years in Afghanistan, I work with many American doctors. Willis is the only one I like. You know why this is? [Scoffs] I can't imagine. His respect for rules. Willis has no respect for rules. Exactly. [Door opens] Still alive. Thank God. Barely. [Man speaks Russian] [Speaks Russian] Who the hell is this? Petty Officer Sergei Ivanov. He was injured in the explosion. He's got a shearing injury from the fragments, to his abdomen. Profuse bleeding. I asked you if there were any other injured. Captain wants you only working on Malinovsky. [Speaks Russian] [Shouts in Russian] So he was willing to let anyone else die, huh? Told ya. All right, let's get him prepped and draped for an ex-lap. [Speaks Russian] What are they saying? I need a laryngoscope. [Cocks gun] [Speaks Russian] You're gonna have to shoot me. [Speaks Russian] You know, he's still holding the gun, right? Yeah, I noticed that. [Monitor beeping rapidly] The right carotid is torn even worse than the left. Mario : She's bleeding through her sutures. We're at 32 minutes. I know. I need more vicyrl. Here you go, Doctor. Come on. Molly needs you at her play tomorrow, okay? [Monitor beeping rapidly, compressions thumping] [Indistinct conversations] How many units? That's the eighth. [Monitor emits continuous tone] Still nothing. Damn it. Mario, take over C.P.R. Heather... No. Okay, I promised her. [Continuous tone] Dr. Pinkney. [Continuous tone] [Sighs heavily] Time of death... 2:45 P.M. [Continuous tone] We'll have to notify the family. I'll do it. I can... I said I'll do it. Dr. Pinkney... Woman on radio :  ... Commence room by room search on second floor. [Indistinct chatter continues] [Indistinct conversations] [Telephone rings in distance] Hank. Ruth. You actually called her? Ruth, you haven't changed a bit. Don't look too close. I'm surprised you came. I didn't come to see you, Hank. I came to ask you again to sign these. Right. Of course. She keeps sending me paperwork. We're not officially divorced yet. This is low, even for you. Low? We lost our home. Our kids, they had to switch schools. We lost our friends. [Voice breaking] We lost everything. Now the least that you could do is sign these papers already. I didn't mean for any of this to happen. How many times can I apologize? Not enough. I need you to do this for me. Please. Fine. If it's that important to you, just give it to me. I'll wait outside. [Telephone ringing] [Indistinct conversations] I thought seeing him would be good from me. I thought it would bring me some closure, but it's just brought back every bad feeling that I've had for the last five years. He's dying, Ruth. He made his bed. I don't believe you feel that way. You don't know me anymore, Rollie. I know who you were. I know who you both were. Come on, Ruth. This is not you. This is what he made me. Could you say that again? Dilated cardiomyopathy. That's why your heart went crazy earlier. That sounds serious. Well... it means you have a severely enlarged heart. Always said you had a big heart. Would you let him finish telling me I'm dying, Arlo? No, that's not what I'm doing here. It's... You need a heart transplant. Jackie's dead. She was one of the good ones. Well, I'm one of the bad ones. I'm a murderer. I don't deserve to live. That was 32 years ago, Sonny. You are not the same person. If I get a heart that could've gone to someone else, someone good... I'll be just taking a second life. I can't live knowing I did that. Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. All right, time to move him. [Pats back] [Monitor beeping steadily] All right, come on, come on, come on. This fragment from the explosion was embedded in his right inguinal artery. [Metal clanks] We're gonna have to get both of 'em out. Yeah. I got it. [Coughs] We need suction. [Speaking Russian] [Speaks Russian] Just a few cc's of blood. Good. It's not surprising, given the injury. He may have a pulmonary contusion. Keep an eye on it. Look at this fragment. [Instrument clatters] It shredded his renal artery. All right, we gotta remove the kidney before he bleeds out. [Exhales deeply] Wait. What about autotransplantation? Find another viable arterial source, preserve the kidney. Move it to where? I don't know, but it'll take the same amount of time as it would to trash it, keep him off dialysis. External iliac. The vessel has the right caliber and it's the appropriate distance to the bladder. Okay, you mobilize the kidney, I'll prep the iliac. Hey... this could work. [Whispers] Yeah. [Radio chatter] Man on radio : We're making a secondary swift. [Indistinct conversations] [Switch clicks] [Gasps] Not one word. You're gonna get me out of this hospital, bitch, or I'm gonna cut you up like I did Jackie. Okay. [Clamoring] Hold on! [Radio chatter] [Blinds clatter] [Whispers] Okay, now. Okay. Shh. [Breathing heavily] [Radio chatter] How you getting me out of here? [Whimpers] How are you getting me out of here? Your internal bleeding's getting worse, Damien. I can tell by the pallor of your skin. Let me help you. I'm fine. Okay. Just get me out of here. [Breathing heavily] You're not fine. Your peripheral arteries are constricting, shunting blood to your central circulation. It's why you arm's getting weak. [Inhales sharply] Shut up. That sweat means your heart is racing, trying to keep up with the blood loss. Your vision is blurry and you're feeling dizzy right now. You don't know what you're talking... [grunts] [Panting] Get me a gurney in here, now! Yes, Doctor. Need a gurney! [Whispers] Oh, my God. [Breathing heavily] [Indistinct conversations] Dr. Pinkney! Dr. Pinkney, I need your help. Now! All right, get him in there. He's in cardiac arrest. Let me get a crash cart, guys! Let's go! Man : If everyone can stand down, we've got Damien. This is unit 6. We've got Damien in Center Stage. Pinkney, he's a patient. Get in here now. [Gurney clacking] [Monitor beeping erratically] Where'd they find him? I  found him in my office... with a scalpel to my neck. [Erratic beeping continues] Oh, my God. Dr. Rorish... No, I'm fine. Let me take a look at that. I'm fine let just focus on the patient. I am. [Beeping continues] Okay, I'll intubate, you open. You sure you wanna save this guy? I'm not a cop and I'm not judge, and neither are you. Now let's go. I need a laparotomy tray, and someone call the blood bank. Woman : On it! Got him? Yep. [Telephone ringing] Okay. [Sighs] I filled out the paperwork for Sonny's transplant. Why? He's right. He doesn't deserve a transplant. He's a murderer. I think people are capable of changing. Yeah, well, you're wrong. Who... who is that woman? Do you know her? No. [Telephone ringing in distance] You know, I don't have a single, good memory of my father. How are you feeling? About as good as a man with a brain full of blood can feel. She took the papers and left, huh? I haven't seen her. I'll order you more pain meds. Don't bother. What's going on with Guthrie? The tremors, flattened affect, festinating gait... I can't talk to you about this. You guys thinking Parkinson's? Listen to me. Ruth was right. We lost our friends, our family, everything important to us. I  lost everything. And Rollie... he's your friend, right? Be his friend, even if it hurts. I'll go order that morphine. [Indistinct conversations] B.P.'s stable. Are we done here? Are you okay? No, actually, I'm not okay. I'm not even in the vicinity of okay. Why did you save this guy? Dr. Pinkney, you should take a walk. I don't need a walk. I think you do. I want an answer! Why?! You wanna know why? You want an answer? Yes! Because a patient had a lacerated renal artery, and a doctor was there. End of story. A patient? He's a murderer. Is that a medical distinction? Because if it's not, it is completely irrelevant. You think that's irrelevant? This psychopath gets the best medical care on Earth and goes back to eating tapioca pudding and shanking people. And Jackie? She goes to the morgue. That's just the way this one went. And that's just okay with you? We do what we can to save people, without adjudication, without prejudice. That's the discipline. That's the job. The only question is, can you do it? No. ♪ ♪ Will : Kidney's pinking up. That's what happens when it works. All right, let's go. We're not even halfway home. Here's the last fragment. Okay, I'm gonna lift it. You can tie off the artery proximally. You do know I'm not your first-year resident, right? Your haircut confused me. [Chuckles] [Door opens] What's going on in here? Who gave you permission to do surgery on this man? I don't seem to recall asking for permission. Do you? Willis... [Lowered voice] Just relax. Keep working. [Cocks gun] What about now? You still relaxing? Step away  now. Get the gun off of him! [Speaking Russian] Do as I say. Willis. Do as I say! [Shouting in Russian] Shut up! He will die if we stop! Shut up! Step away or I will shoot you! Look at me! You and I both know you're not gonna shoot an American Officer in American water. You are correct. You son of a bitch. No! [Punch lands] [Thud] Stop it! [Coughs] This ends now. Detain him. Detain  me? Who do you think you are? Anatoli Sviataslov Malinovsky... Putin, and I am relieving you of your command. [Speaks Russian] Now! [Coughs] [Men speaking Russian] [Monitor beeping rapidly] Sats plummeting. Hurry. If he dies, we lose our authority here. You don't want to know what will happen to us then. [Rapid beeping continues] Will : Pulse is thready. No breath sounds on the left. Trachea's shifted. This is a tension. Pulse is gone. Starting C.P.R. [Monitor beeping rapidly] I'm cutting. [Compressions pounding] Come on. Come on. Come on. [Exhaling sharply] Come on, Ethan. Get in there. [Rapid beeping continues, compressions continue] [Air hisses] [Monitor beeping steadily] Pulse is back. Sats are coming back up. You can tell his uncle he's gonna be fine, and tell him to stay out of our e-mails. [All chuckle] [Telephone rings] [Indistinct conversations] That the transplant paperwork? I told you, I'm not gonna do it. They're going to discharge you soon, Sonny. This might be your last chance. Everyone deserves forgiveness. Tell 'em about the letter. No. No, no, no. Then I will. They said they couldn't live with the hate anymore. Who did? The parents of the guy he killed. Yeah. He read me the letter so many times, we memorized the whole damn thing. Come on. Tell 'em the last line. “We have to forgive you. “It is as much for us as it is for you. "We cannot live... "with hate in our hearts... "anymore.” [crying softly] [Monitor beeping steadily] [Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [Telephone ringing in distance] Hank, look who's here. [Clack] [Exhales sharply] What-what are you doing here? It's way past your bedtime. I wanted the fancy lifestyle, too. Maybe more than you did. Ruth, you don't have to do... Shh! Why don't we give them some privacy? You kept this. We had nothing. We had everything. ♪ ♪ You know, I introduced them. Man, they were just kids, starting their lives. Rollie. Yeah? It's time to talk. About what? Malaya. Dr. Guthrie, we know. Look, I don't know what Hank told you, but it's been a long time since he was a doctor. I didn't need Hank to tell me. Young lady, you are a second-year resident, and I am a senior attending who... ... Who has Parkinson's... Or worse. Oh, and you came to this conclusion on your own, did you? No. I did. Yeah, a nurse. I'm... I'm sorry, Jesse. I-I didn't mean... Yes,  a nurse. The best damn nurse you ever met. You're right. You're right. It's just that I don't think that this is that serious. And I an entitled to my privacy. [Sighs] Rollie, let us help you. [Whispers] Come on. [Sighs] [Inhales deeply] [Indistinct conversations] If you'd, uh, given me a little more time, I could've worn my own... instead of, uh, hunting through the lost and found. How do I look? Like a homeless person. Yeah. [Chuckles] Let me help you. Yeah. What did you do here? How do I look? Perfect. Angus, Linda. Linda, Angus. Hi. Nice to meet you. You're his, um... I'm his stepmother. No, she's not. She is... was  my father's girlfriend. Same difference. I'm glad that you decided to come to the funeral. Yeah, well, might as well see what I'm paying for. Should we take your car? It's in the shop. Not that car. The Impala. I think your dad would like you to have it. Does it still have that dashboard waitress? Yeah, the one that shows her ass every time you hit a bump? [Keys jangle] She's still there. I used to love that thing. He used to drive straight into a pothole just to make me laugh. [Sighs] [Keys jangle] There you are. We're going to make peace. You're kidding me, right? [Cork pops] [Cup clatters] I was white-knuckle panicked today. [Pours liquor] You didn't seem it. We can be tough and scared at the same time, can't we? That's the job.
