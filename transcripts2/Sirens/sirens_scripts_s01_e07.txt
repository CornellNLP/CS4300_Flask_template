 So you're dating someone at the hospital? 
 Which hospital? 
 You're dating people at more than one hospital? 
 I'm dating multiple people at multiple hospitals! 
 How do you do that? 
 (Laugh) 
 I spend a long time in hospitals, man! 
 (Music) 
 Do they all know about each other? 
 Of course, I'm promiscuous not dishonest. 
 Hey, hey, you boys need to clean up those mailboxes, there are overflowing with detritus. It's slovenly. 
 Hank, there's a Jet Magazine in your slot. 
 With skinny Oprah on the cover. 
 She ain't been skinny since '09. 
 I don't get Jet Magazine. 
 I don't get Skinny Oprah, I like her plump. 
 Go on, clean them out now! 
 It'd be great if you could do it soon. 
 The whole thing's really kicking off Stats' counting disorder. 
 64, 65, 66, 67... 
 There are 67 pieces of mail in your slot, Henry. 
 Okay, damn. Damn, girl. 
 Look, look, look, look. 
 So that's... that's done. 
 Hey, you happy? 
 Okay, yeah, that's good. Thank you, Henry. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well, look at this. 
 This is fancy. 
 Personal and hand-lettered, Henry St. Clare. 
 Hmm, calligraphy. 
 Yeah. 
 Someone's getting married. 
 Who? 
 Oh, someone who doesn't have my current home address or cell number. 
 Someone who cheated on me with that busboy. 
 Someone who I could care absolutely less about. 
 Jeff the chef, holy sh1t. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Is he marrying the busboy? 
 No, he's marrying Alejandro. 
 Oh, my God, he's marrying your brother? 
 No. 
 Your cousin? That's so... 
 Oh, my. 
 Brian could you get me a hand in the supply closet please? 
 I kinda want to be here to offer Hank some emotional support. 
 Brian, supply closet, now. 
 If it's any consolation, I think that your eyes are way more soulful than Alejandro's. 
 And your mailbox is clean, so there's that. 
 Look, I know this sucks right now, but this to shall pass. 
 Deuce. 
 What? 
 Can I call you "son"? 
 No. 
 Well, I'm doing it anyway 'cause this is a father-son type talk. 
 Son, this guy ale-what's-his-face may look like you, but whoever the hell he is he ain't got what you got. 
 Which is? 
 Your freedom. 
 You can date all the boys in Boystown if you want. 
 You'd be exhausted, but you could do it. 
 This is your touching, important father-son type message? 
 God damn it, I'm new to this sh1t. 
 And I'm not finished yet. 
 This just goes to show how great you are, that this chef asshole is marrying a guy who's the spitting image of you. 
 I mean, you are such a prize that he went and found himself a God damn Hank St. Clare clone. 
 How was that? 
 Not bad. 
 You know what, Cash? You're right. 
 You can call me "Pops". 
 Jeff is marrying the discount version of me. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Or big papi. 
 And do you remember how pretentious Jeff could be? 
 Oh, with his French fusion cuisine and God damn Asian opera bullshit. 
 You just know Jeff and his little fake-ass Hank husband gonna be one of those annoying couples that adopts, like, six kids from different countries, names 'em sh1t like Bryce and Tristan. 
 In Kenya the father figure is called "Baba". 
 Big Baba. 
 Try it on. 
 I did, don't fit. 
 Hey. 
 Guess who I just got a wedding invitation from. 
 Oh, uh, let me guess. 
 Uh, your college roommate who you just had to set up with my best friend, Hank, who then cheated on him, broke his heart, and basically ruined last summer? 
 You got an invite too? 
 No, Hank did. 
 sh1t! That is what I was afraid of. 
 I mean, he's basically marrying Hank, if Hank had a prettier name. 
 I know. 
 Is he okay? 
 I mean if the wedding is this weekend. 
 How tacky is that? 
 Damn tacky, son. 
 And look at this invitation. 
 Really, bitch, calligraphy? 
 sh1t ain't even got proper margins. 
 Look at that. 
 Uh, soso. 
 It could go either way. 
 Hey, do me a favor. 
 If we ever break up for real some day, and you meet my dead ringer and marry him, will you invite me to the wedding. I want to see what I look like in a tux. 
 There is no way I'd waste 50 bucks on a steak dinner for you. 
 I'll order the chicken.

 I don't even understand why gay guys want to get married. 
 I mean, we had a sweet deal in the old days. 
 Dance, drink, screw. 
 Shop, eat, screw someone else. 
 Drink, dance, go see Madonna. 
 Screw some backup dancer for Madonna. 
 No kids, no rings, no divorce. 
 It was perfect. 
 Other than the Madonna stuff, it sounds pretty good. 
 On top of which, I won this battle. 
 Bitch is marrying a brother look just like me. 
 Who the hell misses who here? 
 Am I right? 
 (All) Yeah. 
 You are gorgeous. 
 And unlike your partner over here, a great dancer. 
 And a free man. 
 You're a real catch, Hank. 
 Yeah. 
 You know what, you right. 
 Mm-hmm I'm the goddamn catch of the county, and I'm taking this fine black ass to my favorite pickup joint. 
 Gay bar down the street. 
 Yep, called the hospital. 
 Donnie, the cute Puerto Rican doctor, gets off at 11:00. 
 And I'm gonna make him my patient tonight. 
 Ooh. 
 Or vice versa. 
 Nice. 
 And you guys are coming back from that wedding with a full report on Alejandro, who I'm betting will be a very sissified,  prissy version of moi. 
 Ooh. 
 Au revoir. 
 Hey, you cannot go to that wedding. 
 He's hurting inside. 
 I know, I gotta stay and keep watch, but that's why you've gotta go and report back that this Alejandro character is a shitty dancer, five-feet tall, and basically a chick with a dick. 
 Fine. 
 Hey, Theresa, if you need a plus one for the wedding, I'd be happy to join you. 
 Whatever. 
 Boom. 
 That okay with you? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Are you guys dating? 
 Both : No! 
 Brian loves weddings. 
 I study them. 
 Seen all the movies. 
 Every one. 
 My only problem with four weddings and a funeral was that it wasn't called five weddings and no funeral. 
 Plus I know how to do the foxtrot. 
 Well, this is gonna be a hip gay wedding. 
 You know, they're not gonna be dancing  to roll out the barrel, so... 
 Actually, that's a polka. 
 But I know how to do that too. 
 So we are covered. 
 I have surprisingly strong calves. 
 I can dance all night. 
 Cool. 
 I'll be your dance insurance. 
 Ooh. 
 [Laughter] 
 No, honestly, he makes you sign something. 
 I will. 
 It's really intimidating. 
 A waiver? 
 Just for just both our safety. 
 So, how was last night? 
 Fantastic. 
 Good. 
 Doctor had a Puerto Rican flag tattoo on his ass. 
 Way we would go, I had expect to wake up to find Puerto Rico just off the coast of New Jersey. 
 [Laughing] 
 Well, I'm glad you're doing well. 
 Never been better, man. 
 Never been better. 
 What the name of the guy Jeff's marrying again? 
 Oh, Alejandro. 
 Alejandro. 
 Alejandro. 
 Saturday, you and me, bro. 
 Two seats on the glass, Blackhawks Bruins. 
 Yeah, way better than going to a dumb wedding. 
 Is that the same day as the wedding? 
 Oh, I had no idea. 
 Wow, I'm so shallow. 
 Well, he sent you an invitation. 
 Chicago North ambulance needed, Lincoln Park. 
 Ambulance 14 responding. 
 I knew when the damn wedding was. I'm not go... 
 I'm just saying, he sent you an invitation. 
 Hit me flush. 
 God damn direct hit. 
 And just to be clear, it was a softball, correct? 
 Yeah, and my nuts feel like they're about a million degrees right now. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What kind of a pitch was that, Greg? 
 It's slow pitch, man. 
 That was a freaking laser beam. 
 All right, sir. 
 Drop your pants. Let me examine the injury. 
 Right here? 
 The sooner you drop 'em, the sooner we can get you fixed up. 
 No need to worry, sir. It's a common sports injury. 
 It hurts like hell, but nine times outta ten it's just a little... oh, my God. 
 What? 
 Oh, my God, I don't believe this. 
 What's wrong with my balls? 
 I can't do this. 
 What's wrong with my balls? 
 Am I gonna lose my balls? Oh, my God! 
 Just calm down. 
 What does that mean? 
 You're gonna be fine. Just calm down. 
 He said... what did he mean? 
 It's a bruise. 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 Now we could take you to the urologist, but between the doctor and the nurse that's just two more people that are gonna see your junk. 
 Your best bet is to ice it down for 20 minutes and walk it off. 
 Brian, handle this. 
 But I've never seen one of these before. 
 Hi. 
 What I meant was I've never dealt with this particular injury. 
 I've obviously seen penises before. 
 Not a lot. Mostly mine. 
 And old guys at the gym. 
 What is it with old guys and nudity? 
 Yeah, right? 
 Exactly. 
 Shut up, Greg! 
 Okay, I'm just gonna... right. 
 That guy's pen1s. 
 Yeah? 
 God, this is so stupid. 
 Tell me, bro. 
 That guy had the exact same pen1s as Jeff the chef. 
 The exact same one. 
 What the hell is that? 
 Don't they all pretty much look the same? 
 Sometimes if there's a lot of guys involved and I'm drunk, yeah. 
 But Jeff's, his was special. 
 I could pick his dick out of a room full of dicks. 
 We're a little outside of my area of expertise here. 
 I just wasn't expecting to see my past staring me in the face like that, John. 
 God, sh1t. 
 What am I doing? Where am I going? 
 What the hell is happening to me? 
 That invitation really messed me up, bro. 
 I know. 
 I know. 
 Think Theresa could my dick out of a room full of dicks? 
 Hank, we got a call from your mom. 
 She needs help at the house. 
 Gotta be kidding me. 
 We're on it. 
 Remind her that dispatch isn't supposed to be used for personal calls. 
 Okay, Roger that. We got it. 
 Listen, you got this. 
 Look at me. You got this. 
 It's just that she... 
 Okay, we got it! 
 Brian, let's roll. We're wheels up. 
 Stop playing with that guy's balls. 
 There's my baby. 
 Hey, mama. 
 Hey, mama Saint. 
 Hi, Johnny. 
 We can't stay long. 
 You need something fixed, mama Saint? 
 Oh, no, I don't need you boys to do any chores for me today. 
 But a little bird just told me about Jeff the chef, and I had to check in with my baby. 
 Who told you about that? 
 Sorry, Deuce, your mom gave me some wine. 
 I just started kinda running off at the mouth. 
 Cassius told me that you're not going to the wedding. 
 Is that true? 
 Yes. 
 Henry St. Clare, you are absolutely going to that wedding. 
 You will not hang your head in shame. 
 This is a proud family. 
 And you are a proud black man. 
 You do not run away from situations such as this. 
 You're gonna walk in there with your head held high, and you're gonna shine like a precious stone. 
 Sit in the front, smile the biggest, sing the loudest. 
 And if the preacher asks, "does anyone object to this wedding?" 
 You're gonna stand up and say, "hell, no, I don't." 
 Henry, promise me you'll go to the wedding. 
 Mom, I'm not going! 
 Hank, your mama asked you to make a promise. 
 Now I know I'm not your daddy, but I do sit at the head of the table, and I do get the extra piece of meat when there is one. 
 We're watching our cholesterol. 
 Mine's supposed to be up over 200 or something. 
 Half the programs on the DVR are my programs. 
 I got about six pairs of drawers in the dryer. 
 Where was I going with this? 
 Help me out. 
 You were telling him to go to the wedding. 
 Yeah, that'sight do what your mama said. 
 Go to that wedding tomorrow and shine like a gem. 
 Just make the promise, son, and make it now. 
 Fine, I'll go. Bye, mama. 
 See? 
 What'd I tell you? Father figure. 
 Oh, he's not going, padre. 
 He's just saying that to shut you up. 
 You are? 
 Yep. 
 We're going to the Blackhawks Bruins game. 
 Bye, mama. 
 Damn! 
 What's wrong with these kids today? 
 Oh, shut up and let's have ourselves a good day. 
 That's what I'm talking about. 
 And ready for a game. 
 Oh, yeah, beers. 
 Fights. 
 Body checks. 
 Jonathan Toews. 
 Patrick Kane. 
 Patrick Kane's eyes and his ass. 
 Okay. Okay, just this once I will talk to you about Patrick Kane's eyes and his ass, because today I'm gonna be the greatest wingman of all time. 
 And tonight, I'm gonna get you laid. 
 Not that you need any help, 'cause you can basically snap your fingers and then 20 blowjobs appear out of thin air. 
 What I wouldn't give to have your life. 
 I mean, just all the one-night stands and casual s*x. 
 I mean, s*x is never casual for me, ever. 
 Like, like ever. 
 Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Where we going? 
 Wedding. I changed my mind. 
 I can't believe I'm saying this, but it is an emergency. 
 Three words: Patrick Kane's ass. 
 I feel like such a pussy for running away from this. 
 I'm 6'5", 220, and like my mama say, we don't run from shiy. 
 Wedding starts at 1:00. 
 We can still make the reception. 
 I'm wearing a Stan Mikita T-shirt. 
 I got one of Jeff's old suits back at the house. 
 You know this thing's worth, like, 50 bucks on eBay, right? 
 The suit I'm giving you is worth a thousand. 
 I could use a new suit.

 As a gay man who fought against prejudice, how can you honestly espouse such outdated views? 
 Because as a gay cop, I realize not everybody can play the game.

 But then I remembered it's all about timing, baby. 
 He loved you, but you weren't ready to settle down. 
 I was, so to us, to me especially, you'll always have especial place in my heart. 
 Because otherwise, I never would to find him.

 Look, I came here today to hold my head up high. 
 And truthfully to see if you were marrying Alejandro as a replacement for me.
