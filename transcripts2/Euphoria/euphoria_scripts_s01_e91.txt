 ALI:  Why didn't you call me? 
 Ali, what am I supposed to do about Jules? 
 It's funny. When I think about it, 
 I still blame Jules for all this sh1t. 
 - ALI:  Why? 
 - RUE BENNETT:  I was clean, 
 and I was, like, gonna stay clean. 
 And for the most part, I was pretty happy. 
 And f*cking Jules. 
 It's like she lied to me,  and, uh, manipulated me. 
 Talking about how we're gonna be together forever. 
 And then, she ditched me. 
 ALI:  I didn't know that. 
 RUE:  Like the whole thing at the train station. 
 Her trying to get me to run away with her. 
 Please. 
 I love you. 
 RUE:  I didn't think she was actually gonna go. 
 - You know, like leave me. 
 - [PHONE VIBRATES] 
 THERAPIST: So, where do you want to start? 
 I don't know. 
 THERAPIST: Okay. 
 Why'd you run away?

 Can we not talk about that? 
 THERAPIST: Why? 
 [RAIN PATTERING] 
 I don't know. 'Cause it was just like a, like a dumb, not-well-thought-out plan, and I was, like, drunk and reacting to sh1t. 
 THERAPIST: Reacting to what? 
 Come on, I, I really... 
 don't wanna talk about it. 
 THERAPIST: Okay. 
 What do you want to talk about? 
 [INHALES SLOWLY, EXHALES] 
 I think I want to go off my hormones. 
 THERAPIST: Mm. 
 Okay. 
 Have you been thinking a lot about de-transitioning? 
 No. 
 THERAPIST: Okay. 
 Then what is it? 
 I don't know. 
 I've just been, like, thinking about what's next. 
 THERAPIST: In what sense? 
 [SIGHS] 
 I mean... 
 I don't know. 
 I guess it's... 
 I guess it's interesting, 'cause, like, before I ran away, uh, I had gone to the city to visit some old friends, and... 
 we were having this exact conversation. 
 And... 
 Basically, um... 
 I feel like I've framed my entire womanhood around men. 
 When, like, in reality, I'm no longer interested in men. 
 Like, philosophically. 
 Like, like, what men want. 
 Like, what men want is so boring. 
 And simple, and not creative, and, like, uh... 
 I just, like, I look at myself, and I'm like, how the f*ck did I spend my entire life building this. 
 Like... 
 [SIGHS] 
 Like, my body, and my personality, and, like, my soul around what I think men desire? 
 It's just, like... 
 it's embarrassing. 
 I feel like a... a fraud. 
 I feel like there's a lot to unpack within what you just said, okay, but the main thing I heard, is how hard you are on yourself. 
 The amount of self-criticism you're experiencing, it's a lot. 
 Yeah. 
 But I, I think it's necessary. 
 THERAPIST: Are you sure? 
 I mean, I hope so. 
 Or else, then I'm really f*cking crazy. 
 You're not crazy, Jules. 
 You're just a lot harder on yourself than you probably should be. 
 JULES: Yeah. 
 Acknowledging that's important. 
 Yeah, but, but also, like, what I'm saying is true. 
 Like, without the self-criticism, I'd be lost. 
 THERAPIST: Or free. 
 Both can be scary feelings. 
 You really feel like your entire existence, physically and emotionally, is, is that reactive? 
 What do you mean? 
 THERAPIST: That I'm not looking or talking to Jules? 
 I'm looking at an avatar she created in reaction to the world? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm here. 
 You know. 
 But you're looking at, like, a million layers of other people that I've grabbed and clung to throughout my entire life. 
 That's, like, that's terrifying. 
 It... 
 I mean, that's why I think when I was talking to my friend about this, or... 
 Or... 
 Well, I don't, I don't know. 
 I guess this is, like, this is our first session. 
 I don't want to get into all, like, the childhood bullshit, 'cause it's a lot. 
 It's exhausting. 
 But when I was having this conversation with my friend, we were talking about how, I feel like my entire life, I've been trying to conquer femininity, and somewhere along the way, I feel like femininity conquered me. 
 THERAPIST: What? 
 What? 
 What was that thought? 
 Well... 
 Like... 
 Most girls, when you first talk to them, they, like, automatically analyze and compare themselves to you. 
 And then, you know, they, they search for where you fit in their hierarchy, and then they treat you accordingly. 
 THERAPIST: What hierarchy? 
 Like, how close you are to what they all collectively want to be. 
 Like, in their heads. 
 THERAPIST: Right. 
 And, you know, even if they've, like, mastered the art of hiding it with, like, smiles and nods, and small talk, it's, like, you'd still catch them doing it. 
 Like, like their eyes wandering over your face, or... 
 or, you know, the quick takes up and down your body. 
 Or like, they watch how your clothes hang off your torso, or, like, they look for what tags are on your clothes to see where you shop, or they'll watch your hands to find, like, fucked-up cuticles or chipped nail polish. 
 Honestly, it would, it would be a kind of sensual experience if it wasn't so f*cking terrifying. 
 So they want to find flaws. 
 JULES: Yeah. 
 Uh, most girls. 
 But not Rue. 
 Mm-mm. 
 What's the first thing that comes to mind? 
 JULES:  No girl had ever looked at me the way Rue did. 
 Hi. 
 I just, I feel like Rue was the first girl that didn't just look at me. 
 Like, she actually saw me. 
 Uh, I mean, not to say that in, like, a cheesy way, 'cause it sounds cheesy, right? 
 Like... 
 THERAPIST: Honestly, it sounds like a relief. 
 Yeah. 
 It... 
 But, I mean, like, when I say me, I mean, I mean the me that I was talking about earlier. 
 Like... 
 The me that's underneath a million layers of not me. 
 I can't imagine how that must have felt. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it felt good. 
 Kind of reminds me of how a mom would see you. 
 Keep going with that thought. 
 Well, just like, how a mom sees you before you're anything. 
 And, like, loves you just for that. 
 And all you have to do is just, like, sit there and exist. 
 Is that how your mom saw you? 
 I, I don't know. 
 I mean, like, the time we're talking about is before you can remember anything. 
 So... 
 I don't know. 
 Is that how you imagine your mom saw you? 
 I hope so. 
 [WOMAN SINGING OPERATIC SOLO] 
 JULES:  Um, I take that back. 
 Uh, I don't wanna talk about my mom. 
 THERAPIST: I promise you, I have no agenda. 
 We can talk about whatever it is you wanna talk about. 
 I mean, uh... 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, I think I really wanna go off my hormones. 
 THERAPIST: Okay. 
 Or... 
 Well, not like everything. 
 Probably just my blockers. 
 I have, like, this weird sci-fi chip implant in my arm. 
 - Supprelin? 
 - Yeah, and it, like, stops my voice from dropping. 
 Um, my balls from getting bigger, you know? 
 The kind of sh1t that men wouldn't find desirable. 
 - [THUNDER RUMBLES IN DISTANCE] 
 - [WATER SPLASHING ON STREET] 
 I don't know. 
 Uh... 
 I've always thought of puberty as, like, a broadening, or a deepening, or like, a, a thickening. 
 Which I, I think is, like, why I was always so scared of it, you know? 
 'Cause in my head, women were always, like, small and thin and delicate, and... 
 You know, so, like, the thought of puberty, like this... 
 irreversible, forever f*cking metamorphosis was just, like, f*cking terrifying. 
 And, you know, that, like, when it happened, I'd just, like, end up on the other side. 
 Like, stuck. 
 Or even worse, just, like, a man. 
 Like, like, through and through. 
 And then femininity would always be this just, like, this, like, elusive, distant thing, you know? 
 Like, unreachable. 
 But, uh, but then, I think about beautiful things that are also broad and deep, and thick, and I think of... 
 something like the ocean. 
 I think, like... 
 that I want to be as beautiful as the ocean. 
 'Cause the ocean's strong as f*ck. 
 And feminine as f*ck. 
 And, like, both are what makes the ocean the ocean. 
 My grandmother used to live by the ocean. 
 And, uh, when we'd go visit, 
 we'd go down to the beach. 
 [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 And, uh, I'd close my eyes... 
 And I'd just swim, and swim. 
 And it didn't matter, like, where I was going, 
 or what could happen. 
 Sometimes I'd pray to the ocean. 
 [OPERATIC SINGER CONTINUES] 
 At least for me, being trans is spiritual. 
 You know, it's not religious. 
 It's not, like, for some congregation. 
 It's for me. 
 It's mine. 
 It belongs to me. 
 And I don't ever want to stand still. 
 Like, I want to be alive. 
 I mean, that's what this has always been about, is, like... 
 staying alive. 
 The only problem is, um... 
 I might have lost Rue along the way. 
 What do you mean? 
 Just that, like, I've, I've called her a bunch of times, and, um, she hasn't picked up, and... 
 Like, I think I... 
 I think I really f*cked up. 
 But, like, I was panicking. 
 Like, I was really panicking. 
 Without, like, getting melodramatic... 
 I've had a really hard six months. 
 Like, moving here has been really hard. 
 And, like, I don't know. 
 Just kind of... 
 A bunch of sh1t all happened at once. 
 And... 
 like, I just freaked out. 
 Like, I panicked, and I felt like if I, if I didn't get out, I was gonna f*cking die. 
 THERAPIST: How? 
 Mm, it's maybe, like, a little hard for me to talk about right now. 
 Were you thinking about hurting yourself? 
 I mean, um, there's a difference between thinking about hurting yourself, and, uh, wa... 
 wanting to hurt yourself. 
 But... 
 I think that gap was closing. 
 [OPERATIC DUET PLAYING] 
 So, I ran. 
 And I left someone, like, I really love, behind. 
 Sorry. 
 Um, I don't know why I'm crying. 
 Uh... 
 THERAPIST: 'Cause it hurts. 
 Yeah. 
 Um... 
 [SOBBING] 
 [SOBBING CONTINUES] 
 [EXHALES] 
 Damn. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 Like, at the same time, though, I'm, like, really angry at Rue. 
 [SOBBING] 
 I feel like... 
 her sobriety is, like, completely dependent on how available I am to her. 
 You know? 
 Like,     she'd ask me to sleep over, and I'd say no for, like, whatever reason, because it was a f*cking weekday, or something. 
 And... 
 [EXHALES] 
 I'd just, I'd feel, like, this weight. 
 Like, this massive weight on my shoulders, and I'd think, like... 
 Like, what if she relapses, you know? 
 Like, what if she relapses 'cause I'm not there?

 DAVID:  I talked to your mom today. 
 She moved out of the halfway house. 
 She's been clean for nine months. 
 Don't do that. 
 Please. 
 Don't roll your eyes. 
 - Come on. 
 It's Mom. 
 - Yeah. 
 You can be angry with her, and I understand that, but you can't just dismiss the good. 
 Well, I'm allowed to be skeptical.

 JULES:  I was afraid to talk to Rue 
 about, like, sh1t that was going on with my mom, 
 because she'd think that I felt the same way about her that, like, I do my mom. 
 THERAPIST: Well, don't you? 
 What? 
 THERAPIST: Don't you feel the same way about Rue as you do your mom? 
 No. 
 You just said you were angry at Rue for the imbalance she created in your relationship. 
 So, would it be fair to say that you resented that imbalance? 
 That the same person who saw you, who truly saw you, in the same way that your mom did when you were a baby, was also incapable of seeing how her additions affected you. 
 I mean, uh, I guess I've, like, never thought about it that way before.

 - [DOOR CLOSES] 
 - RUE: Mom. 
 Mom! 
 For... 
 Stop. 
 I told you. 
 I'm... 
 I have a meeting and then I'll be home. 
 Yes. 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm literally fine. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, I'll text you when I'm on my way. 
 Love you. 
 JULES:  I feel like real life is always such a letdown. 
 - THERAPIST: What do you mean? 
 - I don't know. 
 It's just, like... 
 easier to talk to people online. 
 You can be more open, and honest, and, like, vulnerable. 
 JULES:  Some of the most profound relationships I've ever had 
 have been with people I've never met. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 I should have known I was setting myself up. 
 Or maybe I did know. 
 Maybe that's, like, what I'm actually attracted to. 
 Maybe that's, like, the appeal. 
 The letdown. 
 The fact that, like, none of it's real. 
 And it's all a fantasy. 
 [PHONE VIBRATES] 
 [JULES GIGGLES] 
 [GIGGLING] 
 RUE: [SIGHS] 
 You've never even seen his face. 
 I don't have to. 
 I've gotten to know him, like, really well. 
 RUE: Sure. 
 I have. 
 Like, better than anyone else. 
 Other than you. 
 Except he could be lying. 
 Rue, anyone could be lying. 
 Trust me, Rue. 
 It's not in my head. 
 I think you two would actually really get along. 
 JULES:  I fall in love so easily. 
 I really do. 
 It's, like, almost embarrassing. 
 Why do you think that is? 
 Because half of every relationship is in my head. 
 [LIGHT GUITAR PLAYING] 
 RUE [SOFTLY]: What? 
 Just happy I met you. 
 Me, too. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 JULES:  Wait, Rue. 
 You've been clean for, like, two weeks. 
 Rue! 
 No f*cking way! 
 Mm! 
 Mm! 
 Mm! 
 [KISSING] 
 I'm so proud of you! 
 There were so many times I wanted to kiss her. 
 But I, I didn't. 
 - Um, I'm gonna go get a glass of water. 
 - Oh. 
 Okay. 
 I hate everyone else in the world but you. 
 And when she finally did... 
 [KISSES] 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I should go. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 [DOOR SLAMS] 
 - JULES:  I froze. 
 - [FOOTSTEPS RUNNING] 
 THERAPIST:  Why do you think that is? 
 'Cause I had never kissed a girl before. 
 I'd never even, like, been that close to a girl before. 
 So when it happened, 
 the only thought I had was, like, 
 don't lose her. 
 Um, hey, uh, I was just hoping we could talk about what happened earlier, 'cause, like, I know I was really weird, and, um, I didn't, like, mean it that way or anything. 
 Um, so, yeah, uh, just... 
 I just wanna talk to you. 
 Please call me back. 
 Bye. 
 - [WIND BLOWING] 
 - [LEAVES RUSTLING] 
 
 
 
 THERAPIST:  Why did you think you would lose her? 
 Because, like... 
 How could it be possible that Rue loved me as much as I loved her? 
 [INHALES SHARPLY] 
 I think the better question is why would you think that would be impossible? 
 [INHALES] 
 [INAUDIBLE] 
 [SIGHS] 
 [MAN SINGING OPERATIC SOLO] 
 [PHONE DINGS] 
 JULES:  I can't tell you how many times 
 we'd just be, like, texting and texting. 
 And the next thing I know, it would be, like, four in the morning, and I hadn't slept, and I didn't want to. 
 Like, I'd never tell her this, but... 
 I feel like I got to know him better than I knew Rue. 
 We used to sext forever. 
 Like, about anything and everything. 
 I know it might, like, sound a little weird, but... 
 It was, like, genuinely the best s*x I've ever had. 
 THERAPIST: What made it so fulfilling? 
 It was just pure f*cking imagination. 
 [OPERATIC SINGING CONTINUES] 
 TYLER:  All day I've been thinking about you. 
 Dreaming about you. 
 And all the things I want to do to you. 
 JULES:  I wish I could see your face... 
 and all the colors in your eyes. 
 Would you blush if I told you I loved you? 
 TYLER [WHISPERS]:  I'm gonna f*ck you until you're soaking wet. 
 [KISSING] 
 [JULES GIGGLES] 
 [GASPS, MOANS] 
 Tyler? 
 Why are there no photos of us? 
 [LIGHTS CLICK OFF] 
 Because whoever I was talking to didn't exist. 
 Tyler? 
 TYLER: Jules, it's okay. 
 Come here. 
 JULES:  How could none of it have been real? 
 It felt so real. 
 I wish I never met him. 
 I'm still in love with Tyler. 
 And I don't know when that's gonna change. 
 [SNIFFLES] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [MOANING, KISSING] [JULES PANTING] [FRANTIC KISSING] JULES:  Rue... [BREATHING HEAVILY] [MALE OPERATIC SINGER CONTINUES] [GRUNTS] [EXHALES] - Don't look at my face. - [GASPS] [JULES CRIES] [THUDS] Rue. Rue. [SHOES CLACK ON FLOOR] Rue. Guess what? Rue! Rue? [LOCK CLICKS] Rue! Maybe it's 'cause of, like, everything with my mom. But I just had this, like, really bad nightmare about... living in New York City with Rue. When I got home, uh... she was in the bathroom. - [DOOR RATTLING] - Rue? Can you please answer me? But, like, she had locked it from the inside. Rue, please! [POUNDING] Rue, open the door! Then, like, by the time I opened the door... I can't, like, say it out loud. [SCREAMING]: Rue! Rue! - [LOUD POUNDING] - Rue! Come on... [FRUSTRATED WHIMPERING] [SOBBING] Rue! Rue! Open the f... - [BANGING] - [EXCLAIMS] [DOOR RATTLING] [SCREAMING]: Don't f*cking do this to me! [SNIFFLES] - [YELLS] - [THUDS] [DOOR SHUTS] Hi, Jules. Hey. You look really pretty. I wanted to say hi, and... [FOOTSTEPS THUDDING] [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] It's okay. Hang tight. [DOOR SLAMS] [DOOR CLOSES] JULES: How could you just, like, f*cking ambush me like that? How could you f*cking do this to me? Like, why didn't we talk about this? DAVID: Because I knew that you wouldn't give her a chance. Yeah. Yeah, there's a reason. Like, I can't handle this right now. I wouldn't have done this if I didn't think you could handle it. JULES: What? So, like, it's for my own good? Jules, she's been clean. She's doing really well. All she wants as part of her recovery is to make amends. Wait, what? DAVID: She wants to apologize. You have to be f*cking kidding me. She wants my forgiveness? My forgiveness? So that, what, she doesn't, like, f*cking drink herself to death because she's so guilty? DAVID: Don't be f*cking cruel! - JULES: I don't care! - DAVID: Yeah. You do. JULES: I swear to God, Dad, I don't f*cking care! [EXHALES] DAVID: Okay. Fine. If you really don't care, and this really means nothing to you, then just go downstairs and let her apologize. Even if it's not real? Even if it's not real. Okay. Okay. Fine. [FOOTSTEPS DEPARTING] [DOOR OPENS] [SIGHS] [SCOFFS] [FRUSTRATED SIGH] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR SLAMS] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR SLAMS] Jules. [LOUD CLAP] It was a week later. On Halloween. DAVID: Uh, well, yeah. How long was she missing for? Jesus Christ. And, and you found bottles in the room? Oh, God... How, how long does the hospital want to keep her? Jules... - [KNOCKING AT DOOR] - Uh, that's Rue. Hey. Jules. - [BANGING ON DOOR] - DAVID: Jules, open up. You gotta come home, Jules. I can't come back. DAVID: You're   , you know. You cannot live alone. This is not real life, Jules! I can't, I can't go back to East Highland. - [DOOR RATTLING] - DAVID: Open the door. You're coming home. I'm not leaving here without you! I don't belong there. - [DOOR RATTLING] - Jules, I'm begging you. Open the door! [EXHALES] [WATER DRIPPING] THERAPIST: Okay, well, that's all the time we have for this week. Sorry if that was a lot. I'm the one person you never have to apologize to. Thanks. THERAPIST: I know this is our first session, and I know you didn't want to come, but I'm glad you did. I hope you are, too. Okay, so, just be patient with yourself. And have a wonderful New Year.
