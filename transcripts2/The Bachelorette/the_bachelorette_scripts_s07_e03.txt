 Tonight on... 
 (trolley bell dings) 
 (laughs) 
 Ashley : I feel so happy. 
 I think I'm gonna leave here With what I hoped to leave here with--a husband. 
 You're, like, a great guy. 
 I just want you to know that. 
 (ben c.) it was an absolutely unbelievable night. 
 (cheering) 
 I can just tell, like, you're the type of person That can see past what's on the outside. 
 (william) she hasn't screamed yet. 
 No! 
 I think it's time to finally take this mask off. 
 Ashley : finally! 
 Roastmaster general jeffrey ross. 
 Man : oh, no way! 
 Man : oh, my god. 
 Ashley : I love a man that can make me laugh. 
 We're gonna roast the bachelorette. 
 (Chris d.) oh, no! 
 (ames) I have to go up and roast ashley before a sold out house? 
 Is this the bachelorette" or the biggest loser"? 
 Man : this could go really wrong. 
 I thought I was signing up to be with Emily or chantal, and then ashley's here. 
 (ashley, crying) they couldn't have said anything more hurtful. 
 (william) I just want to, like, just vanish. 
 I-I don't want to be here. 
 Man : guys, where is will? 
 (bentley) I came in thinking That ashley was not attractive at all. 
 I'm not feeling it. 
 I'm not sure how exactly this is gonna go, but there's no turning back. 
 Hi. 
 I'm gonna make ashley cry. 
 And I hope my hair looks okay. 
 (chuckles) 
 It's all coming up on... 
 ♪ 
 Hey, guys, come on into the living room. 
 Man : all right. 
 (cheering) 
 15 of you left. 
 And as you heard ashley say At the last rose ceremony, this is going really well-- 
 So much so, she very much sees her husband being in this room. 
 So let's talk about what's going on this week. 
 Three dates-- 
 Group date, two one-on-one dates. 
 There will be a rose up for grabs on each date. 
 Remember, if you get a one-on-one date, If you don't get a rose, you will be going home immediately, So have your bags packed just in case. 
 As for the dates, you'll find out as your date cards arrive. 
 There you go. See all of you at the next rose ceremony. 
 Man : thank you. 
 Man : thanks, Chris. 
 Man : let's do it. 
 Man : sweet. 
 Ben c. 
 "love strikes in a flash." 
 (all speaking at once) 
 Man : there you go. 
 I'm very excited to get a one-on-one date already. 
 I am actually very optimistic about the kind of chemistry We're gonna have today. 
 So I really hope that today, Ashley and I start our journey to love. 
 She likes it when you don't open a car door for her. 
 She actually likes rude guys... 
 Right. 
 So whatever you can do to just Be kinda mean throughout the day. 
 (jeff) I'm totally bummed out. 
 (organ playing) 
 I didn't have a one-on-one date with ashley. I'm at a disadvantage because she hasn't seen my face yet. Next time I'm with ashley, I am gonna take the mask off. ♪ Ashley : this past week, I had some really great dates, and I'm really starting to form Some strong connections with the guys. I had such a great date with mickey, I'm feeling a romantic connection with william, and bentley literally sweeps me off my feet. I can't believe all these guys wanna date me. Hey! What's up? Man : oh! Date. Big date today. It is a big date. I'm excited. Isn't it so funny what you said to me yesterday? I can't remember what I said. Every time I talk to you, like, bang, it goes out of my head. No. No, you said you wanted-- Next time I was going dancing, to let you know. Oh, we're doing that? Are we doing it? Are we doing it? Are we doing it? You're gonna be so surprised with what we're doing today. Am I? Am I gonna be excited? Yeah. Okay, good. Everyone else has these incredible stories. I hope I get one, too. Um, just wait. Just wait. I think you, in particular, are gonna really enjoy this. Really? Yes. Ben doesn't know that I've been working with flash mob america To choreograph the perfect flash mob That ben and I are gonna be in the middle of. But first we're gonna be going to a dance studio To learn the dance that I came up with. So we're gonna start off, Kinda like you're pouring a bottle of something On your head. Okay, and you're gonna walk around in a circle. Okay. One, two, three, four... (ben c.) I kind of feel complimented that ashley's Brought me to a dance studio when what she really loves to do Maybe the most outside of her profession is to dance. One, two... Three. Three. Open the bottle. Four. I am far from being a professional dancer but I want to impress her. I want her to think I'm good. Out, drop. Okay, whoa! The out" happened a little fast for me. Ashley and I are kind of a cute little team, and watching her dance, watching her do what she loves, That really was special, and she became miles more attractive to me. Fly, fly, fly. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes! You got it! Ow! Oh, sorry. Ashley : ben is doing so well. I'm so surprised With his determination to learn this dance. I think ben is gonna be completely blown away When he finds out what we're doing. I can't wait to see the look on his face. Oh, I love this. It's perfect. This is so nice. Nice. But a fl basically a large group of people D surprise everybody with a choreographed dance. So there are gonna be a hundred bystanders That are gonna be joining in with us and dancing the same routine that I taught him earlier today. You know what I was thinking? No. I wanna do our dance. Really? You wanna do that dance right now? You really wanna do the dance? It'll be fun. Do you remember it? Do we have m-- do we have music? No. No one's gonna know what we're doing. No one's watching us. Come on. Okay. I'll do it for you. (ben c.) I'm thinking, man, like, really? We're gonna Stand up, and, like, do this hip-hop dance routine In the middle of a park in front of a bunch of strangers? That is way out of my comfort zone. You ready? (laughs) I'm doing it with you. I'm doing it with you. All right, we got to... Yeah. Right? Oh, no, people are watching. They are definitely watching. So ben is such a great sport To get up and dance in front of all of these people, but he has no idea the surprise I have for him, and I'm so excited to see how he handles it.

Ashley : tonight I need to find out If I'm somebody that he could fall in love with. I want to live in a bubble with somebody. I want to live in some unrealistic, idealistic bubble Where we are convinced that we are, like, more in love Than any other couple that ever lived. Whoa! You are blowing my mind right now. (jeffrey ross) we're gonna roast the bachelorette. I really want to make ashley laugh, but I may make her cry tonight. I thought I was signing up to be with Emily or chantal, and then ashley's there. (bentley) I couldn't believe he said that. (ashley, crying) they couldn't have said anything more hurtful. (bentley) basically, I feel the same way, but I'm not gonna say that to her face. Like, don't be stupid. I think it's the date that really tops all. It's unreal. It still hasn't set in. There's so many things I'm seeing in ben right now That I really like. During the flash mob, he was fun and light, and, you know, joking around, and--but still... Still really sweet. But tonight I need to find out If I'm somebody that he could fall in love with. Cheers to, um... Pretty over-the-top day, I think. A ri--a ridiculous day. Cheers. Cheers to an even better night. To a long night. Cheers. Cheers. I had so much fun with you today, but I also want to know A little bit more about you and what you're looking for. Um, I've been thinking about love Since I was, like, not that old, you know and just--and, like, Out what, like, the dream love would be I never grew out of that. I wanna live in a bubble With somebody. I wanna live in some unb--unrealistic... Mm-hmm. Idealistic bubble where we are convinced that we are, Like, more in love than any other couple that ever lived. I know that sounds wild, but I really--I mean that. So you-- I-I believe that. Like, and I have a realistic side, You know, to me, but I think why not? Why not, like, Literally, like, blow up the roof and just say that The sky's the limit when it comes to that? I want my wife to make me feel just like There's something unbelievably special about us, Like on a whole new league. And why not? Why settle for anything less than that? Whoa! You are blowing my mind right now. Yeah? Ben c. Has really high expectations for relationships. He's looking for something that's this everlasting love, and, you know, something that you've never felt before and that you don't think you could ever find anything better, and that's honestly what I want. (doorbell rings) Man : oh! Got a date card here. I won't leave you Sitting there on the edge of your seats any longer. I'm hoping my name is on the date card. I'm ready to get out of the house and have fun, Not necessarily to see what's gonna happen with ashley. "ames..." Man : all right! "ben f., blake"... Man : yes! "yours truly, jeff, "lucas, nick, Ryan, "william, bentley. Make me laugh. Love, ashley." (bentley) my strategy is to beat out Every other guy for the rose. It's fun and games for me. Ashley's digging what I'm putting out, I think my wife deserves to feel Like, unbelievably special about how I feel about her. I wanna marry someone that makes me feel like This is what love is, this is what real love is, and this is the first time I've ever been in real love. I like that idea. You're kind of a hopeless romantic. Yes. That's why you're here. You know, I meet you, and I think-- And I have all these thoughts, like, I have these thoughts That I know are, like, the kind of thoughts I'd have if we met In any other situation. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Like, everything I've seen about you I do like. It's the kind of thing, like, we're on a first date today. And what I really want to tell you is that I want to go On a second date. Really? Absolutely. I would be, like, waiting to figure out How to text you tomorrow. I would. I would be trying to Figure out how to say it. I'd be asking my friend, what do I say? Right. Do I put an emoticon or what-- what do I do? Is it too much? You really crack me up, you know that? Yeah, I know. You know what I really love about you-- Well, so many things... Yeah. But tonight I'm seeing your sincerity, and I feel the same way About, you know, getting to know each other a little bit more. Yeah. Yeah. So I know it's been sitting there. Mm. Oh, yeah, I noticed that little guy over there. Oh, you noticed? Oh, the rose. Oh, yeah, that's cool. And I believe everything you're saying and I follow everything you're saying. I would be crazy not to give you this rose tonight. So, ben, will you accept this rose? Yes, I will. Wonderful! Today was a really great date, and everything turned out perfectly. A little one. One more little one for good luck. (chuckles) (speaks indistinctly) there are so many great things I'm seeing in ben right now, and, yeah, there was a little heart flutter there. When I love, I love hard, and I think I need to lay it all out there and I need to trust Even though he could break my heart. Coming up... I think it's time to finally take this mask off. Is he really taking this mask off Or is he just stealing one-on-one time with her? Man : should somebody go stop it? (ben f.) no! I thought I was signing up to be with Emily or chantal, and then ashley's there. (crying) deciding to do this Was hard because I thought everybody wanted it to be Emily. (bentley) there's no turning back. I'm gonna make ashley cry. (ashley, crying) my heart is, like, totally broken. Now how can I do this? (organ playing) Today is the group date, and even though I'm excited, When ashley arrives today, I'm a little nervous 'cause I need to talk to her. ♪ I originally came here with this plan to not show my face and see if there was any type of connection, Uh, from the inside. Thank you. Wearing this mask has been An amazing, life-changing experience, but I feel like I've made my point, and I'm ready to take a big step forward with ashley. So today is the day I'm finally gonna take this mask off. ♪ (hawk cries) (singsongy) hi, guys. How are you? You guys ready for our date? Man : you look great. (jeff) I think she will definitely be, Uh, pleasantly surprised, but, you know, you never know. Hey, ashley. Yeah? You wanna go outside and talk for a minute? Right now? Yeah. Okay. Ooh. Cool. First thing, jeff grabs her, walks outside. And we're wondering is he really taking this mask off, Or is he just stealing one-on-one time with her? (chuckles) I just wanted to talk to you briefly before we head out. The mask is definitely coming off. It's coming off. Man : I hope she comes back. No! What's up? Um, what's up? Nothing. What's up with you? Well, um, I think it's time to finally take this mask off. You want to take the mask off? Yeah, I want to take it off. Finally! I've been waiting for jeff to take off his mask. I want to see his face. I want him to open up to me. That's what this is all about. True love starts from something on the inside, and, yes, physical attraction's important, but really long-term, It--it's all about what's on the inside. So the mask, I believe, has been revealed. She hasn't screamed yet. (laughs) You're such an amazing person. I mean, I can just tell, like, you're the type of person That can see past, you know, the--what's on the outside, and I can see how a lot of the guys are Starting to, uh, fall for you, and I've begun to start having feelings for you as well. I'm nervous, but I'm excited, and, um, I think it's finally time to take this mask off. ♪ Hi. I'm jeff. (cries) My first reaction is I'm happy that he finally took if off, and he's a lot older than I thought he was, but I think he's cute. How does it feel? Awesome, yeah. I'm so glad. Well, now we can just get to know each other Without--without that. Yeah. Well, let's go have some fun. All right. All right, let's go. Man : oh! Hey! Man : he's normal. Ashley : so much better, right? (blake) when he came back without the mask on, It was kinda hard to gauge her reaction. Honestly, I feel like it's one of those things Where someone tells you that "I've got a surprise," and they Open up the present, and there's not a whole lot inside. Man : do you feel like your superpowers are diminished now? Oh, actually, I feel stronger now. I'm not gonna, like, Speculate on whether or not he's handsome, but, uh, Let's just say, taking off the mask in front of ashley, He's just compounding other bad moves, like wearing a mask. The date card said, "make me laugh." So really, I mean, the first thing everyone thinks of Is, oh, no, we're doing stand-up comedy. Maybe we're in a skit or a play, which would be a lot better. All right, so who's the funniest guy in the house? William. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome today because my goal everyday in life is to just make someone laugh. You excited about the date or what? (william) this is seriously Gonna be, like, my dream come true. Man : uh-huh. The first date that I had with ashley was the best date That I've ever had in my life, and I think that the odds Are in my favor that I'll end up getting a rose. Ashley : welcome to hollywood. Man : here we go. What's this? Man : here we go. Man : all right. We pull up in front of a comedy club, and I'm extremely excited. This is right up my alley. I go to comedy clubs all the time. And behind that mask is some, uh, gutsy humor. Welcome, guys. As you know, I love to laugh, and I love a man That can make me laugh. So I recruited the help Or roastmaster general jeffrey ross. Hi, ashley. Man : oh! No way. (william) oh, wow! Oh, my god! (jeffrey) how you doing? Good? You look beautiful. Thank you. Jeff ross is one of the best stand-up comedians That walks this nation. He's awesome. What's up, fellas? Hey, man. How great is this? He's best known for roasting people, uh, like pam anderson, Uh, david hasselhoff, and I mean, he's hilarious. Roasting, as you know, Comes from a place of love and affection. And we thought it'd be really fun, ashley and I, To do a roast here today. Man : wow. Man : all right. And guess who we're gonna roast. (harp plays glissando) oh, no! (jeffrey) we're gonna roast the bachelorette. If you can make a woman laugh at herself, You can make her do anything. So the trick here is To not hold back. She promises she can handle it, right? I hope so. (laughs) Now you're all gonna be up here at once, So you can make fun of each other as well. I know a lot of these guys Are gonna come after me with the whole mask, uh, deal, Uh, but I'm ready for it, and I'll take it, and I've got a lot of things up my sleeve, too. Like one of the guys out there has an outfit on right now That kinda looks like the backstreet boys, and, I mean, that's game right there. And there's one more really fun aspect to this. Um, we're gonna have a completely sold out show. Man : oh, no! I have to go up and roast ashley before a sold out house? I am dying here. Dying. This is the most traumatic thing I may have had to do In my entire lifetime. So the pressure's on. Bring your a" game. Don't forget-- we only roast the ones we love. Let's go, guys. (Chris d.) all right. Whoo! I tell you, it's really dangerous to be roasting... Yeah. (laughs) the girl we're after. It's a thin line right here. I don't know. Normally people allow you to roast them  Once they do love you back. (laughs) Not when you're trying to win their affection. Ryan : so we break out notepads in there, writing jokes, and the concern sets in. I mean, how are we gonna roast ashley and make this okay? Crossing the line is a-- is a dangerous thing. The way to do this and do it diplomatically is you basically focus most of your mean jokes On the panel... Yeah. And then a couple jabs at ashley. Okay. And who's gonna be on the panel? Us? Us, yeah. Okay. (nick) you rolling, brother? No. I'm just, like, there is no way I'm saying that. (laughs) I-I want a rose at the end of this. I know. She might give the rose to who has the most balls, though. Whew! Yeah. Whew! Ashley's gonna be tough. To do it with good taste. This is what I've been dying to do my entire life. I've always wanted to be a comedian, So this is a huge opportunity for me. I get a couple minutes on the stage, and I need to use it to my fullest advantage. If I can impress jeffrey ross, It could open up the door for me to do my dream-- You know, do a roast with ashley tonight, and then roast some famous celebrity In--in a couple months. We'll see what happens. If it was just roasting the guys, it'd be a lot easier. Yeah. They said gloves come off, So gloves come off. I really want to make ashley laugh, but I may make her cry tonight, and I don't want to do that, but it's ru-- it's ruthless tonight. Pfft! My opportunity to finally be real with ashley-- Oh, I'm gonna be real. (laughs) (laughs) If you'd like to date The next bachelor or bachelorette, Go to bachelor.Abc.Com and click apply." (indistinct conversations) How many people are in there? Man : yeah. (ames) today we're gonna be roasting ashley. There's 200 people expecting a comedy show here, and I am the farthest thing from a comedian you've ever seen, So I'm just hoping to survive this. Ashley : you guys ready? (man) ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together For the roastmaster general jeffrey ross. (cheering) Oh, there's the applause. Man : okay, here we go. Hey! All right! Wow! Thank you for coming to the bachelorette roast. This season, we found a lot of intelligent, educated, Charming, and good-looking bachelors, but they all had jobs, so we got stuck with these guys. Come on in, fellas. (cheering) (jeffrey) yeah! I walk out, and, you know, it's dark, and there's-- there's a packed house, and I'm extremely nervous. I just hope ashley laughs. That's--that's the main thing I'm nervous about. Look at this motley crew of bachelors We have roasting today. (cheers and applause) Is this the bachelorette" or the biggest loser"? Please, a warm welcome for our guest of honor--ashley. Let her know, everybody. I'm looking forward to everything about this date. I think it's gonna be so much fun. You know, with every statement that's made, there's probably Gonna be an ounce of truth, so maybe I'll learn something About some of the guys today. I'm excited for that. Normally, I'm afraid of dentists, but I'm not afraid of you at all. Oh. (laughs) You know what they say about cavities-- You fill mine, I'll fill yours. Ready to do this? I'm ready. Are you guys ready? All right. Give it up for the very handsome lucas daniels. This was kinda hard for me. Uh, (bleep) talking is not really my forte, So, ames, when's your forehead gonna give birth? (laughter) Lucas had to go first, and he definitely played it safe. Jeff, I only have two words About revealing your face today-- Bad idea. (laughter) he just kinda stuck to the guys and didn't really roast her at all, Which not exactly true to form as far as a roast goes, but maybe that's the way to go. Bentley... (clears throat) What was ashley thinking during that last rose ceremony? (man coughs) not funny. I, you know, I didn't-- I didn't insult ashley. I didn't really insult anybody at that. Um, I also didn't really make people laugh. I just want you to love me... (laughs) For who I am inside. (laughter) Seriously, I thought it was a good idea. Nick's got muscle, that's true, but you take that away, and what do you get? Bentley. Aw! You take away bentley's good looks, you're left with ames. Oh, ho ho! You take away ames' intelligence, and you get ben. Without ben's suave, you end up with Chris, and without Chris' height, you get william. (laughter) Now you take away all of those things, and all you get is some old guy with no personality. (laughter) Some of the guys, I think, believe that they're funnier Than they are, and when I step out on the stage, Uh, and get ready to deliver my jokes, uh, I mean, it's definitely game on. Our next roaster wore a mask for the first two episodes. Please welcome zorro's unemployed brother-- Jeff medolla. (cheering) Hold on a second. Yeah, that's right. Uh, ashley, I just picked up your, uh, (bleep). Sorry. Oh, ho ho ho ho! What? I know I have small boobs. I'm--I'm aware of this. That's me. So if they want to make fun of it, it's fair game. I'm sure you'll hear worse. Not big. (laughs) We're like, oh, man, You've had all of 15 minutes to talk to this girl, and it's like, "boop, here's my face. You have small (bleep)." Way to win a woman's heart by making fun of her boobs In the first 15 seconds. I kinda thank him For doing that, 'cause it kinda set the bar for the rest of us. William, your jokes around the house are starting to fall Kinda flat, almost as ashley, but not quite. Aw! You're actually the--the first girl I've ever dated With a smaller chest than me. Keep 'em coming! Keep 'em coming! Congrats on being the third runner-up from last season. Okay. That's a huge accomplishment. (laughter) I'm just curious if they're gonna change the title Of this season from bachelorette season 7" To brad womack's leftovers." oh! It seemed like the top two themes of roasting ashley were, You know, "you were on 'the bachelor,'" And, uh, "you have really small breasts." I do have to tell you, ashley, that 60% of the guys Are not here for the right reasons, and the reason why I know that is because 60% of guys in america Are boob guys. No! Bentley! But her ass makes up for it, I'll tell you that. Oh, ho ho! Man : whoo! I'm sittin' there listenin', and it's obvious that these guys don't really get it. It's a roast. If you get up there and you're soft, You're a (bleep). It's a (bleep) roast. (laughter) (laughs) (microphone feedback whines) (amplified voice) hello? I'm kind of excited to hear what william has to say, 'cause him and I have spent a whole day together. We had a really great date-- I would probably say The best first date, so when he starts roasting me, It's gonna be funny and it's gonna be accurate Because he does know me so well. Ashley--so beautiful, so gorgeous, so used. They say one man's trash is another man's treasure. (audience booing) I mean, I thought I was signing up to be with Emily or chantal, and then ashley's there. (audience groaning) Really, who gives a (bleep)? (audience groaning, scattered laughter) (bentley) I couldn't believe he said that. I mean, basically, I feel the same way, but I'm not gonna Say that to her face. Like, don't be stupid. (laughs) Man : too soon. I will tell the entire crowd, get out your cell phones To donate to the ashley boob fund. (laughs) We all love you. (laughs) No, no, no, no. No rose for me. This was a roast. It wasn't compliment ashley" night. Give it up for william. He was never funnier. (scattered laughter and applause) Wow. Thank you for being an awesome roast audience. Give it up for all our roasters, our guest of honor. Bye, everybody. (crying) (sniffling) Do you think that it was kind of the wrong play to come at her, 'cause most of the guys were making fun of the other guys. It was a roast, like, roast. You roast people, and it was like-- I'm not--I--mine was-- So bad. I agree, it was really bad, but at least I didn't offend anybody. (crying) (sniffles) (bentley) after the show, I saw ashley sitting just to the side of the stage, Um, a little--a little hidden in the corner. She was crying, and I thought, okay, I'm not gonna pass up An opportunity to mess with her head, and, uh, get some one-on-one time. You doing okay? Yeah. I'm fine. I hate it when people cry. It's not attractive at all, but I'm obviously here For a reason, and that's to get another rose, So I'll do what it takes, you know? Yeah. Um... I don't know. Just--I'm scared that I let you guys down Because it's me here and not Emily. So... I-- That was said tonight, huh? Yeah, that was said. And, um, just--I just-- That was my biggest insecurity the first night, and-- was it? Mm-hmm. Like, are they gonna turn around, you know? Are they gonna turn around and what, go back in the limo? Like, are they-- Mm-hmm. Go back home? Come on. Stop it. I'm serious. Stop it. No. You have everything. Are you kidding me? Your body, your face is beautiful. (scoffs) You're the best dancer in the world. Mm. You've got everything a guy's looking for. Well, you do have little boobs, but-- no, not the boobs. I don't care about the boobs. I know I have small boobs, but... But they're great. (chuckling) (chuckles) Ashley : for some reason, with bentley being there, I just felt better. There's something about him that's really comforting to me. I love the way he thinks. I feel like he's--he's just a real guy, and that's what I'm looking for. I'm looking for the realness in this, because it can Be crazy, and there can be alternate agendas, but with him, I real--I just don't feel like he has one. You don't believe me. I just--I think I just needed somebody To talk some sent-- sense into me. Well, let me tell you this-- the 25 guys, I promise you... Mm. That at least 24 of them were really excited it was you. Man : oh, man, that was brutal. Man : I just--I felt hor-- I felt--I felt bad for her. Ryan : after the roast, we get to the party, and everyone is still feeling down. It was a very rocky roast. William definitely crossed a line. Somebody's physical appearance is one thing, but saying that you wish it was somebody else is another. At one point in the roast, william made a comment-- "I wish Emily was the bachelorette." That definitely struck a chord with ashley. You could tell that it hurt. Ashley : hey, guys. Um... (voice breaking) so there were a few things That were said tonight That really, really struck me hard, and I'm not-- I'm not trying to blame anyone, and I'm not trying to, um, I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad, but I just wanted to tell you guys That when I was approached to be here to meet all of you guys, I... I really wanted to do it. I really wanted a second chance, but I was really insecure about You guys taking one look at me and leaving. So when I heard that tonight, it really struck a chord. Like, the small boob thing-- like, that's fine. I've always been that way, but it was just-- It was just that one--the one thing about me being here With you guys, and you guys kind of being disappointed-- That's what was the most sensitive for me. When she really exposed how much she was hurt, I mean, it just made a sad situation just devastating. People realize damage has been done. And that's pretty much all I have to say. I just hope you guys get to know the real me, and hopefully, you'll stick around. Absolutely. That's it. Thank you. (william) can we talk about it? All right, let's talk about it. I think william dug his own grave. She's pretty hurt, and he's done. The only thing I want to do is make people laugh... Mm-hmm. Every single day, that's all I care to do. After it was all said and done, I wasn't even thinking About you and your feelings. I just thought about what's Gonna make the crowd laugh, and I went for the jugular... Mm-hmm. To the person that right now, I care about the most. You did go for the jugular. You hit it spot-on. Th-the--the thing that's really hard for me is is that if I didn't care, it would be, like, fine, You know, whatever, but after we had that date together, You know, I really thought highly of you, and I thought That we had something, so this is hard, 'cause you knew me. Roasting was the dumbest (bleep) idea we could've done tonight. (sighs) I said all the wrong things at the wrong time, and I just feel like, honestly, There's--there's no way that I can make it up to you. The only thing that I think is appropriate is honestly, packing up my stuff... No. And going home. Honestly. 'cause I hurt you absolutely more Than anything today, and the only thing that's Gonna cure that right now is for you to talk To one of the other guys and have him cheer your spirits, 'cause there's nothing that I can say that-- To undo what I did. Go talk to 'em. (exhales deeply) I'm an idiot. (sniffles) Man : all right, like, William just put his head down and walked right out the door. Man : oh, really? Man : yeah. After his conversation with ashley, He's probably better off not being here. ♪ (william) honestly, right now I know that I hurt her really bad. (sighs) (clears throat) you hurt a person you care about a lot, You just wish... Everything in the world that you can take that moment back. If you say the things that I did, The only thing to do is pack your bags. I mean, to actually think that I deserve a chance... No way. How are you doing? I'm so sorry. I know. I feel really bad. I just wanted to get it out there, that's all. Just the fact that you could sit there and, like, let people just, like, make fun of you... I'm talking to the guys, but I can't stop thinking about william. All I wanted him to do Was just comfort me, but instead, he wants to leave. So, um, I have a dog. I adopted a, uh, 3-legged dog that was abused, and... I'm trying to move forward. I'm trying to force myself To see what, you know, the other guys have to offer, but, like, in my head, I'm thinking, What if all the guys feel the same way as william? My biggest fear coming here was That I was gonna let these guys down. Right now I don't know if I can make anyone happy here. I'm just feeling... Beat up. (william) today I hurt the one person That I really do care about. You make a girl cry, You kinda wanna run away. But, you know, I'm here for ashley. She's everything that a guy like me wants in a girl. I would say that I don't deserve a second chance, but if she gives me a second chance, Everything is gonna be completely different. Ryan : can I steal you, please? Sure. Ashley : today is not a good day. I'm feeling really vulnerable right now, and I'm feeling kind of sad, and I really feel like I need to be comforted, but nobody seems to be able to comfort me right now. (speaks indistinctly) I don't want you guys to feel bad. I just wanted to kind of talk to you and just let you know what I was feeling. Yeah. You know, it's just hard because I feel like the--the last time I was here, I was so insecure About so many things, and I wanted to come here Feeling really confident, and I do, except for-- That highlighted my biggest insecurity before I came here. Really? (inhales sharply) But, no, I mean, you know, it's fine. It'll be fine. What can I do? Nothing. I mean, you've been great. You really have been. Don't worry about it. Ashley... You're who I wanted here. You are... You are who I wanted here. Whatever those guys say, I'm just looking forward to spending more time with you. You have no idea. What are you smiling about? You're so smiley! I'm sorry. What is there not to smile about? You're so smiley! It's like--its, like, it's you, right here in front of me. Mm-hmm. And it's like... ♪ahh ♪ So you're happy I'm here? Yeah, I am happy. That's a good thing. That's a good thing. Yeah. God, you look... What? You look gorgeous. Thank you. So do you. I feel better now. (chuckles) 
 
 (knock on door) I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. (constantine) you're gonna go get it? You think it's the date card? Man : I suspect it might be. I think it's gonna be One of three-- me, west, or constantine, and everyone else seems to think it's gonna be me Simply because I haven't been on a date with her yet. But nothing happens according to plan, (man) it's gotta be. "J.P."... (claps hands) (constantine) made it. "there's no place like home. Love, ashley." (mickey) what does that mean? (constantine) what? Who cares? I'm going on a date! You're going. One-on-one, "there's no place like home"-- I don't know what it means. I don't care. I'm just--I'm juiced, and I'm ready to go away. "there's no place like home." Maybe she's just sending you home. Is this a date card? (all laugh) (constantine) "there's no place like home. Enjoy it." (all speaking at once) ♪ Wanna come this way? Yeah, let's go. You feeling all right? Do you feel tired? Yeah. Are you? Mnh-mnh. Good. Yeah? Now that the night is almost over, I really wanna talk to bentley. It's been a rough day, and I feel like, you know, Kinda when it rains, it pours," Like I'm feeling most like myself, vulnerable, Like, I just want to get it all out there today. I'm feeling like an open book. So I think tonight is A really good night to tell bentley what's on my mind. How you doing? Feel better? Feeling better. Doing better now. Yeah. Yeah? You having fun? Mm-hmm. Today was really fun. Good. So I kinda want to tell you something. I don't know how you're gonna take this... Okay. And I don't know if I should've said it when I first met you. Before I arrived... Mm-hmm. I was contacted by somebody about you. Okay. Before I came here, I talked to a friend from last season, michelle money, and she said that bentley would-- Would--would be expecting to come here for a couple weeks and then go home, Um, and that he was here just to promote his business. Today I didn't plan on talking To bentley about her concern, but I respect him so much that I have to-- I have to talk to him about what's on my mind. This person told me That I should kinda, like, watch out for you and that your intentions in coming here weren't the best, and when I found that out, I didn't really know if I wanted you here at all and then decided that I wanted to give you a chance, 'cause I feel something for you, but I'm also really scared That you could be that person to hurt me. I didn't come in planning on telling you this, but I just Felt like it was a good time to kinda just put it out there. That's it? That's it. Well, thanks for telling me. I wish, like... I don't know what you heard. Something about you promoting something. And another thing was that You're only expecting to be here for, like, a week Or two weeks, and then you're gonna leave. I don't know. I don't feel like, um, It really applies to what we have going on here at all. Mm-hmm. I-I have a feeling, like, This might be coming from michelle-- Michelle money. She, um, knows my ex-wife, and, um, I wouldn't even say that that would be A great source of information. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know really what else to say about it. If you did choose to--to leave, It would be harder than anything I ever went through Last time I was here. Um... That's good to hear... Mm-hmm. For me. I think you can feel that, right? There's a feeling there, for sure. I know-- I know, but can you trust in this? Yeah, I-I-I know--I know-- I'm--I'm totally on the same page as you. I'm following you every step of the way, I promise. Oh, look at her. Come on. Sorry. I just can't help myself right now. Jeez. I think we should go see the other guys. Mnh-mnh. No. After talking to bentley, I believe every word he says, and I'm moving forward. I'm not letting this hinder our relationship. Honestly, my heart races when I'm with him. I feel warm, I feel comfortable, I feel secure, I feel protected, I feel like I could trust him forever. Are your eyes closed? (chuckles) Are they? Are they closed? Yeah. Good. (bentley) that was (bleep) close. Michelle tried to sabotage my chances with ashley. I think she was unsuccessful. I think she had Her attempt at being a snake, but I'm still here. Ashley's completely head over heels, and I'm probably gonna get a rose. Let me grab this. You guys all did such a great job today. Um, I know comedy and public speaking is not everybody's forte. But somebody that I feel is really genuine, and he's so positive every time I sit down and talk to him, I am blown away by just how great of a guy he is... So, Ryan, Will you accept this rose? Absolutely. Absolutely? Gonna put this up here. How's that? Good? (bentley) I was surprised. Her telling me the things she told me-- For her to give another guy another rose Helps me justify it in my mind-- I'm checking out, but I'm trying to figure out what I'm gonna do. I'm afraid it's gonna hurt her a little bit, but stand by. (clink) ♪ Ashley : my biggest fear going into this was Are the guys gonna be let down that it's me? And last night, the roast brought back that insecurity. But my one-on-one with bentley was so great last night. Just him coming to console me was all I needed to feel better. I completely fell in love with bentley last night. There's something about him that's so sincere. I just know that he's my guy. If it was up to me, I would grab bentley and take off to salt lake city, Honestly. I think I'm gonna leave here With what I hoped to leave here with--a husband. Today marks the first day of my love story. (bentley) last night, michelle tried To sabotage my chances with ashley. I think she was unsuccessful, but, uh, I don't want to stay here anymore. (chuckles) Ashley--I've been saying from the beginning, Like, she's just not my type. I'm not feeling it, I feel like it's a waste of time, and it's better just to walk away. I'm to the point where all I want to do is Be on the first plane back a.S.A.P. What are you doing? Packing up. I'm, uh, heading home. Why? Time, bro. It's time. I woke up this morning, and it just--it hit me. It's, like, today is the day, you know? Gosh. I mean, out of all the guys, You've had the most time with her, You've hung out with her the most, and she likes you the most. And so how are you gonna tell ashley? It's one of those tough decisions in life. You just gotta do it despite... How hard it is, Because you know it's right, you know? That sucks, dude. Are you sure? Yeah, man, I... Good luck to you, though, bud. (bentley) I really miss my daughter, but she isn't the reason I'm leaving. I'm not really into ashley, So regardless of ashley's emotions, I know it's the right decision for me. I think the other guys are gonna be shocked. They haven't seen this coming. Guys, I'm going home. I wanted you guys to know that. It's just kinda come to a point where I can't be away From my daughter anymore, and, uh, Yeah, I just really need to go. Man : you're a good dude, man. You're doing the right thing. You're doing what your heart tells you to do, man. Yeah. Yeah. Man : you're a good Dad. Thanks. Give you guys a hug. See you, dude. These tools-- like, these freaking idiots-- They believed me. Best of luck, gents. Take it easy, buddy. Best of luck. All of the guys know that I'm a front-runner Because they see my connection with ashley. Make it happen. She is more into me than anyone else, but none of 'em have any idea that I don't care about ashley. Later, guys. Best of luck, seriously. I had the opportunity, and I played everyone. It's something that's never been done before, So... (scoffs) I came in thinking that ashley was... (inhales deeply) not attractive at all. I knew for a fact I wasn't gonna fall in love with her. So I need to go say good-bye to ashley, and the time is now. I'm not looking forward to this at all Because it's gonna be emotional for her. Heartbreak is, you know, Worse than any illness, in my opinion. It's not just physical pain, It's emotional pain, but it has to happen. The only other option that I have is to stay, and I know that's not an option for me. So I'm gonna make ashley cry, and I hope my hair looks okay. (chuckles) She's so into me, but I don't know how I'm gonna, like, Keep doing this and keep going through this, Because I don't want to. I came into the bachelorette" hoping that it was Emily. It's, like, she's such a standout. She's so breathtakingly beautiful That ashley kinda looks like an ugly duckling to me. And if I'm not interested in the girl, I'm not gonna stick around. I feel like, I don't know, I'm about to go Do some huge performance I haven't rehearsed. So here we go. Talking to ashley's one of those things but there's no turning back. It's a trip, dude. It's freaking in my head. I need to go poop it out. Hi. Hi. Can I come in? What's going on? Can I come in? Yes. Give me a hug. You're scaring me. What's going on? Hi. Yeah, did you? Um... Uh, not really, but... You wanna come in? Yeah, I'd love to. Ah, I'd love to. (bentley) I'm going to tell ashley I need to go home Because I miss seeing my daughter. It's just too overwhelming at this point. But being real, the reason why I'm leaving is I'm not feeling it for ashley at all. Do you get to watch TV? No. Are you sure? Are you sure? 'cause I don't even know if that is a TV. Mm-hmm. Uh... Uh... This morning I-I missed my daughter more than anything. Mm-hmm. Um... Um... Are you leaving? (clicks tongue) yeah. Are you coming back? I don't... Think that's an option. Um... (heart beating rapidly) I... In no way, like, want to... Um... No, come here. I know, like, you're here to... Um... Find love... Mm-hmm. And I've been telling you from day one what I'm thinking and how much I'm thinking about my daughter, and I woke up this morning feeling like... My daughter really misses me. And, like, the thought of her, like, Wondering, like, where daddy is, like, just... Mm-hmm. It's, like, too tough for me to, like... Uh... Take any--any longer. The thought of her, like, asking her mom or anyone, Like... I understand that. I do. Where's--where's daddy? Yeah. Like, just kill... (sniffles) I understand that. Kills me. (bentley) I talked a lot about needing to go for my daughter, and she's going for it. (sniffles) I actually started to tear up a little bit. No tear, like, dropped, but eyes got, like, watery, He, like, consoled me and stuff. (crying) of course I want you to go to your--see your daughter, but if it was up to me, I would bring her here, you know? (sniffles) What? I don't know that I can see myself Giving you my heart, falling in love-- Whatever you want to call it-- with my angel... With my baby that has my whole heart back at home, Like I-I don't know how to share that with you When you and her, like, haven't even met. (sighs) (sniffles) And I want you to be with your daughter. I'm just scared. I'm really scared. (sniffles) It's, like, you know, you daughter has your heart, but right--like, right now you have mine, and I don't--I don't know If this is gonna work for me now. I've had the same tears. Ugh. It's, like, a-a-- it blows my mind That it's as hard as it is. It really does. It's, like, I pictured the end, and, like, I pictured you there, you know? I know it sounds crazy. It feels crazy, but... It doesn't. It doesn't sound crazy to me. I've thought a lot about the end, too. (sighs) The end was, like, tomorrow. I know. Me, too. (sniffles) Oh, shoots. (bentley) it didn't go any better Than I thought it was going to. Come on. I was worried it was gonna go that bad, and it did. (sniffles) Just a lot of crying. A lot of crying. (sniffles) it's annoying to just Hold a girl that's just crying and crying and crying. I was already, like, checked out, you know? (whispers) can I call you? I'm so sad right now. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Mm. Mm. (kisses) It was, uh, a lot of hugging, a lot of tears, A lot of kissing. (sniffles) I kissed her neck a bunch, actually, 'cause that's, like, where I was, so I started like... Kinda trying to turn her on a little bit. Bentley. (grunts) she was standing up on the couch, and she wrapped her legs around me, and I was like, We're in a great position To start something really good right now, 'cause, like, she was straddling me, and she was, like, in my face, and then it's just, like, I don't know... (makes kissing sounds) you know? Ooh. I talked to her like I would talk To a girl that I'm really interested in. The only difference is I'm not, like, totally interested in her. (chuckles) you could come with me. (slaps leg) This is gonna sound like... It's, like, I can't. I-I guess it seems like the only thing to do Is, like, kind of close a chapter, but I don't really, like, I don't know at all. Even if I'm not coming back, like... I still want to keep the dot, dot, dot" there. And if you think about it logically, Like, it doesn't make sense, but don't think about logic, like... (whispers) dot, dot, dot. Hmm? (normal voice) I said, "dot, dot, dot." Dot, dot, dot is better than just a period. I hope you, like, you feel that and know that and, like, understand that. ? Mm-hmm. Promise? Mm-hmm. (bentley) it wasn't a quick departure. I'm thinking, how am I gonna get out of this, Because I'm definitely done on the ashley front, and I have to go. Mm-hmm. (sniffling) Ashley--she's somebody that I'm not necessarily smitten by, but definitely, like, the type of girl That I would totally hook up with now and then. And looking back, Things could have turned out differently If the bachelorette was Emily. (speaks indistinctly) (whispers) I'll miss you. (sniffles) Like, it's scary to know I'll probably never see you again. I know it hasn't been a long time. I know that sounds crazy, but that's really hard. Now how can I do this? Hey, you're gonna be okay, okay? We're both gonna be okay, okay? (kisses) Bye. (whispers) bye. (crying) why? Why? Why this? Why? (sobbing) I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do! How can I do this? (sobbing) (continues sobbing) ♪ After everything yesterday and today, Like, it hurt. I'm ready for my time, you know, I'm ready for my happy ending, and I thought it was with him. (sobbing) My heart is, like, totally broken. Was I wrong about everything? (sobbing) (sobbing continues) I think after bentley left today, I just got really scared that... This might not work for me. He was the person, At this point, so early on, that I-I saw in the ending, and now he's not here, and I'm scared that it's not gonna work. You know, I came here never thinking That I would feel the pain that I felt last time I left, and here I am. I chose to believe bentley, I still believe bentley, but looking back, it's like, were my instincts wrong? Like, I'm the type of person that when I fall for somebody, I fall hard. I'm scared that there's not enough time To heal from that and then fall in love again. (sniffles) And one of the hardest parts is that tonight is the date with J.P. It's not fair to him that this is gonna be his date, Just because I can't see myself Having a really good date tonight, and that sucks Because J.P.'s a really good guy, and he deserves to see the best of me, and he's not going to. Hi. Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? (kisses) I'm good. Thanks for coming over. Thanks for having me. You brought me flowers? Yeah. You look gorgeous. Thanks, J.P. It's good to see you. Good to see you. I know that she had, uh, an emotional night Last night on the group date, I know that Bentley going home today couldn't have been easy for her, So I don't know how emotional she's gonna be. Worst day ever. I do want to know that she's okay, and once I touch on it, Then we're gonna go on with the rest of the night. Finally. To a relaxing evening at home. Yes, cheers. Been a lot of emotion, a lot of drama, but tonight is about me and ashley, and I've gotta find a way To help her put all that aside and focus on the two of us. Obviously, bentley went home today. Mm-hmm. That's gotta be so difficult. Um, so first thing, I just--I just want to make sure you're okay. (mouth full) I just want you to know That if I am a little bit down today Or just kinda feeling, like, a little bit more mellow, I'm emotionally drained, and I don't want you to think It has anything to do with you. I will do my best to take your mind off it. Mm-hmm. But don't take it personally. As long as you're okay... Yeah. Then we can go on with our night. Let's go on with our night. How about that? All right. You're all that matters right now. You're all that matters right now. We're all that matters right now. That works for me. Okay, good. Ashley and I-- there's definitely chemistry, and I couldn't be more sincere when I say I'm--I'm in this for the right reasons. My head's in the right place, my heart's in the right place. Tonight's the night. I can't believe you're single. How long have you been single? From 22 to 30, I was single. Two 3-month relationships here and there... Mm-hmm. And--and I told you I dated someone For two and a half years. That ended and... Like, what ended? Did you? Did they? Like... Mostly me. There was always just something missing, Like it" was always missing. If you are always breaking up with girls, how do I know That you're--that you're not gonna break up with me? (laughs) Well, that's a wonderful question. I guess you never really know. You don't. You know, you take a leap of faith. Yeah. Yeah. You get hurt, but time heals all. You just move on, and things get put into perspective, and eventually you meet an amazing girl, and things change. Cheers to that. (clink) ding! You know what I kinda wanna do right now? Mm. I want to put on sweatpants and get comfy and cozy. I can do that. You wanna do that? Yeah. All right, let's go. If you can enjoy a quiet night at home with the woman you love, That speaks volumes. It's the little things that matter most, always. You know, ask anybody who's been In a long-term, loving relationship-- It's--it's the little things. (laughs) Slumber party! I know. You look cute. We're almost wearing the same thing. What are these? You look so cute. I don't know. They're, like, little... Thanks for letting me look like this in front of you... I am glad you did. On our date. I'd rather see you like this. Really? Yeah, absolutely. This is me, I guess. I like it a lot. I'm sorry that this is our first-- please stop apologizing. Really, like... I know. Okay. This is how I wanted it to go. I just hope I'm helping. No, you are helping, and, like, I feel like I came into this With a couple different fears, one of them being that I was disappointing you guys by being here, and another one was that people, you know, Weren't gonna stick around. And I feel like after the past couple of days, Like, two of those fears were highlighted... I think-- And I feel, like, kind of defeated and just, like, exhausted. Exhausted, yes. Do not feel defeated. I really want to be here. Mm-hmm. And you're gonna be okay. Thanks. No problem. Well... I wanted to tell you that I'm so happy that you're here. Honestly, of all the guys, I was really happy that it was you that was coming, and... Thanks for letting me just kinda be me, and have a bad day on our first date. It's gonna happen. Um... But I promise we're gonna have a really, really fun  Next date. Next date, huh? Yeah. Will you accept this rose, J.P.? Absolutely. Okay. I had an unbelievable time, and I'm flying. It was an absolutely unbelievable night. It was perfect. You--you don't think feelings can develop, like, That quickly, but there's-- there's something there. There's absolutely something there. I feel it. I hope she felt it. Kinda hard to kiss with glasses. You can take 'em off. There's something about J.P.'s kisses. Even comparing them To a kiss I had with bentley-- J.P. Over bentley in the kiss department. Thanks, J.P. If you'd like to date The next bachelor or bachelorette, Go to bachelor.Abc.Com and click apply." (thunder rumbles) Man : how do you feel about tonight? Man : I am so nervous. Man : it's really late. I feel like I'm at dinner waiting for my date to arrive. Yeah, and she's two hours late. I got--I got to the restaurant. You know, we all want some time with her, especially those of us Who haven't had any yet, so her getting later and later... Man : it's gonna be crunch time. Man : yeah. Ashley : so much is on my mind right now. I'm about to go to the first rose ceremony That bentley's not... There at. And I thought I was gonna be okay, but I'm emotionally drained and heartbroken. This time last week, I saw my husband in the room. (sighs) And this week, I don't know what I see anymore. Bentley was my guy. My mind and my heart are so focused on bentley leaving That I'm having a hard time thinking about the other guys. I'm sad. I'm really sad that he left. (voice breaking) and then thinking about the end of this, and maybe it not working anymore. (door closes) Hey. Hey. You okay? We'll see. (thunderclap) sit and talk? So... Rough week? Rough week. Because of bentley? A couple little things happened. The big one is bentley leaving. Yeah, I walk in here tonight, I see you staring at his picture, and you're putting on a brave face for me, but I can tell, In your eyes right now, that you are hurting, and you're, like, this close to tears. (voice breaking) I don't know why. Like, what was it about this particular guy That just got under your skin? I can't tell you. I never thought it would be this hard so early, you know? I never thought I'd go through What I went through last time here. What do you mean? Just, like, feeling like this, like, brokenhearted, you know? You know what? You know how you always said to me, "did you love brad? You loved brad." Right. Well, you know what? I think I loved that guy. A--how short is that? Like... But, I mean, I don't doubt you, but I'm just wondering, like, was it the idea of him Or was it maybe the whole thing was kind of forbidden and 'cause you were warned about him from the start? I'm trying to figure that out, too. You confronted him this week, right? About the text messages and everything? Mm-hmm. What'd he say? And he--he kind of... Reassured me that that wasn't the case. Yeah. But maybe michelle was right. Do you think she was? I don't know. In my--in my gut, I don't think she was, but looking back on it now, maybe... Maybe she was. You know, when this whole thing started, Obviously, we didn't foresee this coming... Mm-hmm. But, you know, you said, "I'm gonna open myself up. No regrets." I mean, the thing is, That might lead you to be kicked in the gut... Mm-hmm. And it has. For me, the hardest part was the good-bye was left With a dot, dot, dot, so there's no closure there. It's such a guy thing to say. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Because if it was open-ended, he would be like, "I'm gonna try and come back. I'm gonna fight like hell To come back. I'm gonna," you know, like... Yeah. He didn't. He left. Mm-hmm. He could've stayed, because a real man would've Moved heaven and earth. He would've done everything he could to fight for you. If he wanted to be here? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 'cause there's guys in this other room that  Have moved heaven and earth. They have quit their lives, That's another thing. And he obviously took up a spot in your heart, which is unfair. I think he took it with him, too. I fell for him. I did. Like, I felt like he was my guy... Yeah. And now walking into the room tonight... (voice breaking) I'm gonna feel so alone. I'm sorry. Who would've thought this, huh? Yeah. I've never seen you this upset. I know. It's--it's really taken a hold on me. And, you know, what's bothering me the most right now Is, like, it's unfair to the other guys. These guys are patiently sitting there... Here. I know. Dying to see you tonight. I know. In your mind, what's the perfect scenario? What do you wanna do tonight? I don't know. I told you when this started, there's no rules. We don't, you know, that's why I'm asking. What do you wanna do tonight? This is up to you. I don't think a cocktail party tonight. Okay, straight to the rose ceremony. Mm-hmm. Do you know, by the way, what you're gonna do? Do you know who's going home tonight? I think so, but I need to think about it a little bit more. Okay. I understand. Mm-hmm. All right, well, now you have a lot to think about. I do. I'm gonna go talk to the guys, tell 'em your decision. Mm-hmm. Tell 'em there will be no cocktail party, and I'll see you out there. Okay. Thanks, Chris. All right. It's all good. Thanks. Man : it's getting kinda late. It's late. Man : fashionably late is one thing, but... Obviously something's messed up. Would she have went and seen bentley? I mean, I... If she wants to go see bentley, then I'm going home. Man : Chris harrison. Guys. Hey. I know I'm not exactly the person you were hoping Or expecting to see. You've been patiently waiting here tonight For ashley to arrive. That's not gonna happen. I just talked to her. There will be no cocktail party tonight. She is gonna talk to you guys, but it'll be at the rose ceremony, Which is right now. So if you would, make your way into the rose room. We'll get ready for the rose ceremony. All right, guys? Thanks. Man : man, right to the rose ceremony. Is this not freaking you guys out? 'cause it's freaking me out a little bit. I would have definitely liked To have spoke one at a time. Man : I think we all would've. I'm looking forward to just now starting, Uh, some type of a friendship, relationship with ashley Without the mask. Tonight's my first rose ceremony without the mask, and I definitely want a rose tonight. (william) how are you feeling? You're back there singing. I'm, uh, gonna enjoy the evening. I feel great. It killed me, sitting there, Because I feel like a giant ass. I blame myself absolutely more than anybody For what happened at the roast. I hurt her feelings, and that was the dumbest thing I could've done. I was hoping to at least speak my peace, but I can see that I'm not getting that opportunity. I'm gonna be going home.

(jeff) wearing the mask-- The whole original idea behind it was To go in and not show my face and have her get to know me For who I am on the inside and not the outside, but it was a lot more difficult than I thought it was gonna be.

Dude, it's missing the engine and the steering wheel, but, I mean, it's only 100 bucks. You think that's worth it? No. All right, well, dude, why don't you get out of here, dude? Seriously.
