 Tonight on The Bachelorette... 
 Ali : I'm dating 17 guys right now, and I feel so confident that I'm gonna find my husband. 
 Ali : Whoo! 
 Frank : Whoo! 
 Hello, Hollywood! 
 Whoo! 
 Frank : sitting here in this spot feels like The most romantic place I've ever been. 
 Ali : today I'm pulling out all the stops. 
 Vegas! 
 Jamie cullum is gonna play just for us tonight. 
 Whoo! (laughs) 
 Man : this date is phenomenal. 
 Ali : I know he's a nice guy, but I need to make sure there's a connection beyond that. 
 I have a really big surprise today. 
 It's gonna be the sexy guy calendar. 
 Whoo! 
 Oh. (laughs) 
 Ali : go! (squeals) when they handed me this... 
 (laughs) uh, My first thought was no way," but it really feels nice. 
 Whoo! 
 Man : up and down. 
 One... 
 (camera shutter clicks) 
 Ali's wearing a black top. I think this was supposed to be the bottom. Have you guys seen my little brother the weatherman? Jonathan : Craig m. Is one of the worst people I've met In my life. Take your hand off me. Seriously. If you touch me again, it won't be good. (man laughs) a little tae Kwon do. This guy is crazy. He's just asking to be laid out. You're such a young punk. Why are you so upset? Look at me and... Don't (bleep) touch me. Jonathan : he's not safe for anybody. Someone said I was dangerous. Take some accountability for your actions, dude. Jonathan : I have to make sure That she doesn't give him a rose. Chris Harrison : gentlemen, Come join me in the living room, please. Man : thank you. (cheers and applause) Man : yeah! I can't believe I'm here! Welcome and congratulations. You are the men that Ali has picked to get to know better, but in the end, only one of you will win her heart and hopefully become her husband. All right. Let's talk about the important stuff. What's gonna happen this week? There will be three dates-- One group date, two individual dates. On each date, Ali will give out a rose. If you g that rose, You're safe through the next rose ceremony. Now on the individual dates, a little bit different. It's a double-edged sword. That's where you want to be, Because you get that alone time with Ali, but if you do not get a rose on that date, You're going home immediately. But be happy you have a date at all, Because not everyone will have a date with Ali this week. So who goes on what dates, and where are you going? Well, you'll find out as the date cards arrive. I have your first one right here. Man : ohh. (applause) I will leave it here. Fellas, I will see you all at the next rose ceremony. Later, Chris. Man : What do we got? Whoo! "Frank." (all) ohh! Yeah, baby! (applause) (laughs) Frankie. Yes, baby! This is exactly what I wanted. I'm here for one reason only... Whoo! And that's to fall in love with Ali, and I know she's here for one reason only and that's to fall in love with one of us, and I hope I'm that guy. "all signs point to love. Ali." Oh, my God. Yes, they do. (applause) Man : wow. They absolutely do. Man : don't disappoint. I would love to be the first one-on-one. Uh, you would get to be the first guy To actually spend more than three minutes with her, So I think it's a really important date, Obviously, and he's a lucky man, 'cause he's got a huge leg up on the rest of us. Huge leg up. (laughs) this is unbelievable. Oh, my God. You gotta get a rose. With this first date, I either get a rose or I don't, and so on one hand, it's exciting to think That I'll have that rose and I'll feel that connection with her, and on the other hand, I might be going home tonight. If, for some reason, I don't get a rose on this first date, I'll be heartbroken. I'm pretty confident, fellas. Might want to pack your bags, Frankie. (laughter and applause) Man : yeah. ♪ Ali : waking up in L.A. This morning, I feel great. I'm dating 17 guys right now. (laughs) That's awesome. (laughs) I really need to keep an open mind in this, and I-I want to try to date guys that I normally wouldn't date. I'm so happy and grateful that I got my second chance at love, and, you know, it all starts today. I have an exciting day planned today, and I think that Frank is the perfect guy to bring. Frank impressed me the first night, and he seems like he's a lot of fun, but I don't know if there will be a love connection, So I really want to see if that's there today. I want to see if we have that spark. Hey, boys. (laughs) Men : ohh! Man : go on. Get it. Aah! (laughs) Go on, Frank. The whole reason, you know, I'm out here is To get to know Ali, so, uh, to see somebody else Get a chance to do that first is rough. You're sure that wasn't a typo--his name on the card? Yeah. (laughs) Man : It was. It was a typo. Sometimes people mistake "Jonathan" for frank." It's very similar. They're... I think I have the best personality here. The problem is letting her see that, and it's really tough. I haven't made that connection. I haven't had the chance To make the connection that I want to yet. I didn't-- Frank : sorry, fellas. (laughs) bye, guys. This is our car! (laughs) oh, my g. So, before, I know the sunroof couldn't really contain you, So I thought d get a convertible... (chuckles) oh, my God. (laughs) that'd be better. You can hop on in. I'm actually gonna drive. I was gonna open the door for you. Oh. Oh! Look at that. (car door shuts) Oh! (laughs) yeah, baby! I'm just so jealous. I wanna be riding shotgun in that car. Frank : get jealous! Get jealous. (Ali laughs) the old bench seats. (engine revs) Men : Whoo! Yeah! Justin : I hope Frank's bags go out the door tonight. I don't want to see him back here. Good work. Okay. Bye, guys! (laughs) (men speaking indistinctly) Frank : oh, my God. This is freaking amazing. (Ali speaks indistinctly) oh, yay! Out of the house! But then again, it's right there. (laughs) yeah, baby! Freedom! Aah! It doesn't go very fast. Whoo! (laughs) Whoo! Yeah! (laughs) Ali : we're gonna be doing funny, silly things today, and I wanted to bring a guy who was gonna... Aah! (laughs) be able to let loose and have some fun, and Frank is perfect for that. Frank : I mean, honestly, that you picked me For the first date-- I know that I will have the absolute most fun On this date with you. Ohh. (laughs) Whoo! Whoo! (laughs) Frank : you know, nothing could ruin this date. I've got a beautiful girl. We're in a beautiful car, cruising down the highway. What could go wrong? Ali : I'm hoping that it opens up in a second, and then we'll get there in-- 15 minutes. (engine knocks and sputters) (gasps) oh, my God! (Frank laughs) Oh, my God! Oh, my God. (laughs) (engine sputtering) The car's dead. Oh, my gosh. It's dead. (gasps) Oh, my God. I cannot believe this just happened. Oh, my God. This is ridiculous. Well done. Well... Done. (laughs) oh, my God! (engine sputters) Ohh. It's not happening. Nope. Yeah, the-- All right. This is--frank, did you enjoy your first date? This is it. Yeah. Yeah, thank you. I really appreciate this. (laughs) I-I guess I'm walking back to the house. Ali : oh, my God! Oh, my God! (laughs) (engine sputters) Frank : we're cruising down the highway. I felt like a million dollars. I've got this beautiful girl next to me. (engine sputters) All of a sudden, the car dies. All right. We gotta do something. We going? I didn't want to waste any time, so I'm like, you know what? We're walking to the date. (laughs) Ready? Let's run. Frank : let's do it. (laughs) let's do it. Ali : I might panic in that kind of a situation, but I literally just kind of sat there and laughed for a second. Thank you. There you are, my dear. Okay. Frank just went with all of it. I know this is gonna be an amazing date. (Ali laughs) All right. We're going to Hollywood. ♪ (laughs) okay. Ali : we pull up on Hollywood boulevard. I want to show Frank All the fun little things Hollywood has to offer and see all the stars on the sidewalk, and--I mean, we're in L.A. Where else do you go but Hollywood? Man : are you the new bachelorette? I am. You are? You guys on a date right now? We are. Can we get your autograph? Sure. Frank : I've been to Hollywood before, and I loved it, but it wasn't like this. People are swarming Ali. They want autographs. The paparazzi's there snapping pictures, and I felt so proud that I'm the guy with Ali. Work it, Frank! I wanna see you work it! (camera shutter clicking) (Ali laughs) All right. Give me-- give me--give me sexy. (laughs) I like it. I like it. All right, I'm... (camera shutter clicks) Ali : I'm so glad that he didn't, like, shy up and, like, Be like, I'm not doing this. He just went with it. Yeah, baby! Work it, girl! Ali : Whoo! I could tell he was uncomfortable and it made him nervous, but he did it anyway, and that's exactly the kind of guy that I want to be with. Well, we're like one big, happy family. How handsome is he? Cute, huh? It feels amazing to be next to Ali right now, and we've on been on the date for a few hours, and I already feel like we're a couple. Aah! (laughs) The other guys at the house should just go home right now. Mm. Aah! Justin : I'd love to sit here and say, "you know what? I'm gonna be friends with everybody in here." I'm not, but I still think you're an all right guy. I still think you're an all right guy, too... All right. Well, there you go. Just not for Ali. Really? Not for Ali. Wow. Yeah. Not for Ali. There is one guy in particular That is glaringly not right for Ali, it's Justin. The night that we met Ali, The first thing that I asked Justin was What he did for a living. He managed gyms, and he was in real estate, but he failed to mention something that came out later In the night--that he actually is a professional wrestler. When I asked you why you didn't tell me the truth About your profession, and you said to me, "well, I told the truth to Ali, and that's all that matters." I-I wouldn't say that--that I lied to you. What would you say, I told you half the truth. Craig R. : "rated-r." Rated "I don't believe a word you say." What's so-- so you're--so are you-- uh, when you-- When you finally get her, are you just gonna go around and walk out--you're gonna go to a cocktail party with her and just lie to everyone in the room? But you're gonna tell the truth to her, so she's-- You're just gonna tell her... No. Absolutely not. "oh, Ali, it's cool, 'cause I'm telling the truth to you, but I'm just lying to everybody else In the entire room, but as long as I'm truthful to you..." He's had a nice little ride. Why don't we just let him f-- You know, float back to Toronto and--and have a nice little life there, and that'll be good? ♪ Whoo! (sighs) You--aah! (laughs) (laughs) I have a really big surprise for Frank today. No one gets to do this. I don't know that anyone has really d--got--done this. Um, but we get to. Ali : anybody can walk down Hollywood boulevard, but very few people can do What Frank and I are about to do next. I'm really excited about it, so I hope he enjoys it. Here we go. (clanks) Aah! (laughs) Frank : she pulls this key out of her pocket, and we go busting in the Gate, and now there's a steep grade... Aah! (laughs) and we're kinda like st-- You know, stumbling over these rocks, and she's got this cute little smile on her face. She's up to something, but I have no idea what's next. (laughs) oh, my God. (laughs) Frank : unbelievable. (Ali laughs) Hello, Hollywood! Whoo! Whoo! (laughs) ♪ Ali : the view from up here is so beautiful, and we have the whole city at our feet. We're basically sitting At one of the most famous spots in the whole world. It's so amazing. Frank and I have a lot in common, and I'm excited to get to know him So much better than I already feel like I do. I want to hear, actually, more about your Paris story. Ali : I want to know about that. You, like, just picked up everything and went for it? Frank : yeah. You know, a number of years ago, I started screen writing... Mm-hmm. And I fell in love with it, and I finally was like, You know what? I want to do this all the time. So I just quit my job. I left it all behind, and I went to Paris. And I was there for, like, a month and a half or so. Did you speak French? Uh... Oui. Oui. Parlez-vous français? (laughs) No, I-I really don't, actually. (laughs) I don't speak any. I, um... Completely changed it up. Like, now I am a-- I'm managing a retail store while I write. Mm-hmm. That's awesome. To me, it was an easy decision. Like, I follow my heart, you know, and everything I do is kind of base On that gut feeling that I have, and I knew that it was right. I feel Le career will always be there. Mm-hmm. And I feel like we can always jump back into that. I feel like you only have so many shots at finding love, You know, and if you wait too long, Great opportunities pass you by, you know? Mm-hmm. Ali : I feel like, Because I'm so career-driven, Sometimes I lose track of what's most important, and that's love and family, and I feel like, if Frank was in my life, He would remind me of that every day, and I love that. So few people actually get to stand Under the Hollywood sign. Frank and I got to kiss for our first time Under the Hollywood sign, and I just think that's so amazing. Frank : even though it's our first date, I see so many qualities in Ali That I've always been looking for. I'm already starting to feel something for her, and I'm hoping she feels the same way with me. They fixed it. Beautiful. Finally. No more cabs. No more cabs for you. Ali : I'm so glad the car's fixed, and we're gonna go experience e rest of our date. Aah! (laughs) (Frank laughs) I'm taking Frank to one of the most spectacular spots In Los Angeles, Where we can be on top of the world. Oh, my God. I'm so happy that I met someone like Frank. (cork pops) Whoo! (laughs) yeah! Beautiful. A toast. To... To an aming date... Yeah. With an amazing girl. Aw. Amazing guy. Thank you. (clink) (both) cheers. Uh, well, this I'll just put... Right up here. Oh, as a little tease, huh? (laughs) Way over there, just out of reach. This entire date, all I've thought about is How much fun I'm having with Ali and how well we connect. I was not even thinking about the rose at any point, and now, all of a sudden, it's on the hood of the car. I need this rose tonight, because I need to see Ali again. Ali, I just want to thank you again for... (kisses) (chuckles) picking me for this first date. I just feel so lucky and was so flattered. This date has been phenomenal. Well, good. I think you-- I mean, I said it earlier. You're those four things I want. You're funny. You're so funny. That's so important to me. Smart. Uh, quirky... (laughs) I am quirky. To say the least. There's nothin like, normal about you, and it's good. (laughs) the--I-I would hope... (laughs) But I would hope-- there's absolutely not one thing normal about me. No. But, like, the--the-- in the important things. (laughs) Like, things that are boring and--and, like, not unique. Yeah, yeah. Like, and I hope that-- I think that about myself. I think I'm a unique girl. Yeah. Absolutely. And I hope that--you know, I don't want to be normal. Yeah. Yeah. I want to be different. Frank : it feels so good to be close to Ali, and it feels so natural. I mean, Ali and I have amazing chemistry. (both laugh) (knock on door) Man : who is that? Oh. Man : all right. Can't do that again. Man : here he comes. Here he comes. So--hey! (men cheering) All right. Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. Let's hear what this says. Quiet. It is a group date. Man : what? Yeah! Whoo! "Jonathan..." Whoo! Thank you! Ty : is not going. (laughs) (laughs) I'm just-- I'm just kidding. (speaks indistinctly) Man : tell the truth. Next is myself, thank goodness. Hell, yeah. "Chris h... Kirk... Mr. Hunter..." We got a Tyler? There he is. "Steve... Craig r... Chris n... Kasey..." Kasey, all right. "Justin..." and one more. (laughs) "Craig m." All right, Craig. Man : he's in it. The clue is, "picture us together." I'm gonna have to go hang out with Craig m., Which is absolutely terrible. I mean, he's not a good person, period. I wanna know what, uh, Ali's gonna think When she sees your (bleep) tattoos. (laughs) (laughs)'cause, I m? Did your mom do that for ya? Man : ohh. (laughs) you're a funny man. (laughs) honestly, I don't think Ali's looking For a lot of tattoos. Ohh. (laughs) I-I mean, you're 24 or 25, and, I mean... You know, I don't talk (bleep). I just hit. Wow. That's a huge rebuttal. There's some male drama going on. I don't like that kind of stuff, so I'm gonna steer clear of that and just keep my eyes on the prize. And you're a good-looking guy, but you--that's all you got. That ain't the--that ain't true. That ain't true. That is. That is. Yeah, you already said it. You don't have nothing to say. You're a good-looking guy, but that's it. ...Seriously. Are you gonna be okay with that? What? Sure. It don't matter. God. You're such a young punk. Ohh. Mm. You are. You're 24, aren't ya? Come on, man. Seriously, Craig, that's enough. 24--24, 25. Why are you so upset? You're a (bleep). Come here. Craig. Seriously. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. You'll still win, seriously. Roberto : I think it's a little bit ridiculous. You know, I'm here for Ali, and I'm gonna stay focused on that. I'll just sit back While the other guys take each other out, and, hey, I'll get the girl in the end. (laughs) God, I got him going. Easy. I don't think he should be around Ali. There's some guys here I don't think are right for her, but he's just no good. ♪ Ali : this night is perfect. I know what's gonna be hard for me is these next couple days without you, you know? Mm-hmm. Especially if you come to the house and I see you, and it's like, then you go off with... Mm-hmm. That's gonna be tough. I know. One thing I will not do to myself Throughout this journey is try not to act like I'm too into a guy For fear that he'll leave me. I've done that way too many times in my life. I'm done with the games. I'm done with all that. I'm gonna let each guy here know exactly how I feel about them, and I'm crazy about Frank, and I want him to know. Um... I'm so glad you're here. And I, you know, came here Hoping I'd meet someone really great. You have exceeded any sort of expectation I could possibly have. Um... And I wanted to know If you would accept this rose and stay here with me? Absolutely. I had the best day. I think you are funny and so charming and just... Really amazing, but amazing for me, too, and that's what I want and what I'm looking for. So I'll give you that. Um... (inhales and exhales deeply) And I know, like, The next couple days are gonna be really hard, but I hope that, like, you feel good About the time that we had together, and, you know, I feel really good about it, so... I-I feel-- Remember that a few days from now. Yeah. No, I mean, and that's what's gonna get me through those days is knowing, No matter what happens, like, nothing can shake That connection that we've--we've built, you know. And I know there's a long way to go here... Mm-hmm. But I don't care how long it takes, you know? Mm. And, like, I'm--I'm here to the end. Good. Mm. Mmm. ♪ Frank : this is, far and away, The best first date I've ever had. I've had some great first dates. This one blows 'em all away. ♪ Ali : when I originally decided to take Frank on this date, I was unsure, honestly. I thought I'd have fun with him today. What I wasn't necessarily expecting is how much romance there'd be between us, How much chemistry romantically. No matter what happens through this whole process, I met a guy today Who made me believe That everything that I'm looking for is possible. ♪ 
♪ Ali : I have 12 guys going on a date with me today, and we're headed to a beach house in Malibu. I'm definitely happy about my date last night. Frank surprised me. I knew he was a good guy, but I found out yesterday he was a great guy. It's making me really optimistic to move forward. But I don't have to just impress one guy. I have to impress 12 guys today. And I'm a little bit worried About being just overwhelmed by all the guys. It's gonna be hard. It's a juggling act. Man : whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hello. Man : yeah, I have a funny feeling about today. What?! Man : ow! Man : Whoo! Man : beautiful. Man : wow. Man : whoa! (men cheering) (chuckles) Hey. Wow! Welcome. How are you? I'm good.

Just to get a little bit of the view... Man : oh, Holy cow. Pretty amazing. Ali : Justin, how you doing back there?

I'm hoping I get some one-on-one time today, you know, with Ali. Ali : Justin, how you doing back there? I kind of feel like the odd man out, but I would go up and down that hill ten million times for Ali. Ohh! Cheers to a great day for a good cause. (clinking) Man : cheers. Ali : Whoo! I'm really grateful that we get the opportunity To give back today. I get to be here on this beautiful beach With 12 hunky guys, so I'm feeling pretty good right now.

I'm sure it's gonna be something that we all Can't even really imagine. Oh, my God. Banana hammock? Whew. (chuckles) headband? Oh, man. Man : Craig, how's the hair? The amount I want a rose is Equal to how much of a (bleep) Craig m. Is... It probably just gives you a little shimmer. Which is like... (clicks tongue) It's, like, exponential. I mean, it's, like, to the 20th power. Looking good. Looking good. And it's all about the headband. (laughs) Jonathan : what in the world? Ali : Whoo! Oh, my God. I don't know It kind of just hit me. I might be on someone's wall at some point. My mom is gonna love this. (laughs) Uncomfortably comfortable. Absolutely. You're making me uncomfortable. Aw, man. I'm a little bit more shy. Tnot the most comfortable guy in the world right now, That's for sure. When they handed me this to wear... (chuckles) uh, my first thought was no way. Not a chance." But it really feels nice. Do you have an extra sock laying around? There's a little extra room in there, Steve. Man : yikes. Please don't let them put me in a speedo. (laughs) I don't know. My legs are bad.

Like, wind in the pants. No, t see, you work your legs out, and that's the difference. He just looked like a frightened little kid That didn't want to jump in the pool for the first time. Okay. Okay.

Ali, on a scale of 1 to 10, is probably, like, a 63. (laughs) Michael : that's cute. Ali looks unbelievable. Beautiful. Ali leaned up against me. She touched my leg. Whew. Thank you. (laughs) To have that intimacy with her Was something I've been waiting r. Man : get your telescope erect. You want it erect? Man : yeah! You know, there are 11 other guys on this date besides me.

So you have to bear with me, but, uh, I was married... Okay. And... I got divorced, and it was... Not a bad divorce. It was one of those things where it just wasn't right. Well, how old were you when you got married? I was 27. Okay. So I was only married for a little over two years. And I was not perfect, I'll be the first to admit. I mean, you have to give and take, and if somebody didn't realize that going into the whole thing, It can be extremely tough. But, uh, I learned so much about myself, and I hope this next time around, I think that I have learned enough life lessons... Mm-hmm. That I can be a great husband and I love being married. I really do, Absolutely. I'm really glad that you TD me that now. I-I think it's really good to say those things up front Rather than wait, and I think this was the perfect moment, and I really respect you for doing that. I'm glad, because I'm gonna be honest with you. It's like a burden that was lifted off my chest. Oh, good. So I feel a lot better. Now you can just relax. I can relax a little bit now. Great. Mm-hmm. I believe that she accepted it, and I don't think she holds Anything against me for that. I just need to find something I'm really passionate about. And I'm like, you know what-- mm-hmm. Or you could just find a girl you're passionate about. (laughs) there you go. There you go. Just giving you an idea. Absolutely. So far it's been great. I definitely want the rose really bad. That's a nice white coat you got on. Jonathan : I made it. Gee, weatherman's working it. Uh-oh. Here we go. (laughs) Craig m. Is seriously-- no joke--an evil dude. He's poison to the house. He could be poison in a relationship with Ali. That dude is totally out of his mind. Basically, like, a category six... (bleep) Which isn't even-- it's just off the charts. I do martial arts. I'm a brown belt. I've been doing that for about a year and a half. You know, you come at me, I'm just gonna put my hand In your face or something like that. We learn to just react. It's like, I don't want to get in a fight. (high-pitched voice) this is my moneymaker, baby. (normal voice) you can't make excuses For these kinds of people. Like, this dude needs to be called out, and, um, I just think it's a really-- A dangerous person for her to be around. Ali : hello. (laughs) Excuse me for interrupting. You know what? We'll finish this conversation. Everything was going so perfect, and in walks the weatherman. It was so nice chatting with you. Absolutely. Thank you so much. I mean... Dude. Hey. Hey. I just needed a few more minutes, and I think it would have been so awesome. Who sent the weatherman in there? I'm really hopin' to get a rose tonight.

Um... Yeah, there's actually something I want to talk to you about. Okay. Um, like, there's a whole bunch of decent guys here, right? Mm-hmm. But there's some guys I don't think that are necessarily right for you. I like to think I'm a pretty good and quick judge of character. Mm-hmm. And there is, like, one person, who in my opinion, Blatantly showed, like, a huge, huge lack of character. And, um... (clears throat) I don't know. Do you want to know who that person-- yeah. No, please tell me. It's, like, it's tough, 'cause I don't want To be, like, the rat, but--but... The guys will not know this. Okay. So, um, I just think the one person-- And you may already have this feeling about this person... Mm-hmm. You--you really-- you sure you want to know? I'm positive. Okay. Uh... Uh, Craig m. Mm-hmm. He's, like, literally, like-- like, a dangerous person. This guy is crazy. He's just asking to be laid out. Like, I do not want to get in a fight. That's not me. I do not want to do that, but let me tell you how much he wants to get in a fight. He's just not--this is not really--not good-- It's not good for anybody, so... And I'm--I'm probably Gonna, you know, whatever. I don't know. Any--I'll shut up. So... No, seriously, you... Thank you so much. Mm. I feel really relieved. I don't know if I'll get the rose tonight, but the whole time I've been saying, if I can just Get one-on-one time with her, I will feel better. Oh, my God, she looks . She looks amazing. Amazing. Ohh. (speaks indistinctly) (laughs) I thought the bikini was good, but you know what? This is actually-- like, this is better. She's like... (high-pitched voice) "hey, I'm Ali." (normal voice) I'm like, "hey, you're Ali. Whoo. Oh, my God." hi, guys. Ahooga! How are you? You're so hard to get ahold of. (laughs) Mnh-mnh. Craig R. : yo, weatherman. Weatherman, how did it go? Oh, one sec. Yeah, it was... I don't wanna tell 'em any details. (smacks lips) Weatherman, come over here, buddy. They're asking for you. You know, I don't have to tell them anything. W-why should I tell them anything? Like I've always said, I'm not here to meet 24 guys. I'm here to meet Ali. What's up? Well, how'd, uh, how'd everything go? I'm happy. She's great. She's, like, totally real. I'm just, uh, I'm just really happy I finally-- you think she may be possibly lying to you... (laughter) about how e felt about you? I'm being serious. You're such a (bleep), dude. I'm trying to ask you an honest question. I just want to know if she actually ahd a chance to talk. I'm being serious. Yeah, man, we talked about a lot of stuff. I don't know. I racked my ain. You really had-- you had a connection, Or you just saying that 'cause you feel like you need to? Yeah, I feel like I had a connection. (Craig m. Laughs) Craig m. Is one of the worst people I've ever met in my life, Honestly. Did you sit down when you were talking to her? Did they give you cushions to sit down, like a booster? The guy's a jerk. He has no concern for other people's feelings. Did she see the shoes you were wearing tonight? (laughs) he's an egomaniacal... Jerk off. (laughs) (doorbell rings) Look what we got here. Jesse : what we got? What we got? All right, all right, all right. So four of us haven't had a date yet with her. I was really nervous. I was like, man, if it's not me, I'm one of the remaining three, and I haven't had any time with her. Hmm. What's it say? "use these when the time is right... Ali." There's no name on it. What's in the box? Are we supposed to guess? All right. What do we have here? Oh, my God. Look at these. Cuff links. John : I have no clue. Let me see. Check this out. (speaks indistinctly) Here we go. Whose initials are j.B."? J.B. J.B. Frank : sexy Beck? J.B. Roberto : there's the initials right here. Let's see. Huh. Yeah. I'm excited about tomorrow. I'm--I'm nervous, too, you know? The very first suit I bought was the one I bought for this trip. Chris L. : I would love to spend some one-on-one time with Ali. Honestly, I'm a little disappointed, but at the same time, I'm just gonna bide my time and wait for that. I was one letter short. I thought for sure that was gonna be j.C." I hope you fail miserably. (laughs) Jesse : and it could happen. (chuckles) (groans) ooh. You know, I think getting a rose tonight is very important. Of course, more stairs. I just kind of have to step it up a notch, and I'm keeping my eye on the prize. This is kind of a competition, so I'm definitely gonna do Whatever I have to do to get her attention. Ahem. I'm not here for the guys, so if they wanna dislike me For whatever reasons, so be it. Ohh. That's all that matters to me. How are you doing with everything in the house? A little bit challenging. I want you to know I'm super confident in who you are In my time with you, and even though it's been brief, like... I know. I know. I have a really good feeling about you and I think you're really genuine. That means a lot. Well, good. I'm glad you're here. What do you think Ali and Justin are talking about right as we speak? He's definitely playing the sympathy card. You can put, like, a mountain in front of me, and I'll--I'll still hitchhike to the top of it. Well, hell, we put a-- I-I know, well, it was pretty close today, and I survived. I don't think he's here for the right reasons. He comes in with a rated-r" shirt on the first day. If you're here to find love, you're not gonna come here and show off yourself and show off some kind of, You know, self-promotion. This whole experience is about being open, and--and you are, and that's awesome. You're making me smile right now, 'cause I think-- well, I'm--I'm glad. Ooh. Can I, um, sit with you? Oh, man. No, absolutely. I don't know. Just... I like you. It's nice. Well, I hope you like me. Um, what's--what's there not to like? (laughs) like, all--all jokes aside, what's there not to like? Tonight was crucial. You know, I had to get That one-on-one time with her, which I did. Man : I've seen that look. You kissed her, didn't you? I'm here for a reason, and you know, if I got a rose tonight, Looks like I'm, you know, might be here to stay, So watch out, guys. Um... First I want to say... I had really great conversations with a lot of you tonight. Some of you opened up to me and really had my back, and I really appreciate that. I'm gonna give the rose tonight To a guy who never let me forget that he was there and that he's here for me. My heart was beating. I was, like, trying to get some eye contact with her, See if I was gonna get any signals or anything like that, and then she kinda looked over. So I'm gonna give this rose to Ty. Man : attaboy, Ty. (laughs) Will you accept this rose? Absolutely. I was really happy that I was the one chosen. Thank you so much. Thank you. (kisses) I am falling for Ali, so I'm really interested in knowing What's gonna happen down the road. It's gonna be cool. Damn it. I wish that was me getting that rose. He did pull out his guitar, which, to me, honestly, When you do that, that's a little bit fake. Cheers! I think Ali's, like, a sharp cookie. She'll see past that, like, in two seconds. Hopefully I'll get a rose later on in the week. Thank you. The reason I'm here is for Ali. If she keeps Craig m. Around,  I go home, because that tells me--that's a huge red flag. It's like welcoming danger. I mean, that's how you get hurt in life. Coming up... Ali : I am so thrilled to surprise Jesse today. I love it. You are not scared. Whoo! Vegas! Whoo-hoo! Jesse : just hanging out with Ali--it's amazing. Aah! (laughs) If Jesse comes back with a rose today, That means there's one less rose for us. If he comes in, We throw the weatherman out the front door. Jonathan : Craig m. Is off the charts in insanity. Take your hand off me. Seriously. Jonathan : I-I can't allow someone like that To be in Ali's life. I just kinda want to know who would have said that about me. Jonathan : he's not safe for Ali. I'm really looking forward to my date with Jesse today. Jesse is hot. I mean, he is sexy. That's sort of where I am with him. And, uh, I hope it develops into more. I don't know a lot about Jesse. I just want to give him a chance To open up and let loose, have a little fun, but also show that we're compatible. This is my first one-on-one with Ali, and I'm stoked about it. I can't wait. I think Ali and I have a connection. Ali's a great girl. She's a great person, got a great heart, and that's something that's pretty important to me. There's a rose on this date, and if I don't get it, That means I'll be going home. I was told to bring my cuff links, and that's about it. Amazing out. It's gonna be probably pretty fancy. You know, I'm a t-shirt kind of guy, So I guess I'm fairly nervous about that. (exhales deeply) I don't want to be sent home tonight. I want this rose bad. Really, I have no idea what to expect. (airplane engine roars) I am so thrilled to surprise Jesse today. I mean, I'm taking him on a private jet. That's, like, out of the movies. It's gonna be a fantasy day, and I think it's really just gonna blow his mind. Oh, there she is. Wow. Ali looks incredible today, Wearing her skinny jeans and heels. Sexy as ever. To be the guy going on this date, it's gonna be huge. It's gonna be something I've never experienced before. And I'm definitely excited about it. (laughs) hey. Hey there. How's it going? Good.

I've never ever been on a private jet. I'm stoked about it. How are you with little planes? Are you afraid of flying? I don't know. I've never rode in one. I'm terrified of flying, yeah. Are you? That's all right. We'll get each other through this. Okay? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, good. After you. (chuckles) Ali : I've been scared of flying for a very long time. And just because I got in a plane with Jake one time and was okay, doesn't mean that my fear of flying is gone. Ohh. I hate flying. Oh, my God. I'm getting a little nervous. Jesse : yeah? You're gonna be okay. I don't know why, but jets freak me out More than, like, 2-seater propeller planes. Yeah? 
 
 (laughs) oh, my God. This is intense. This is intense for sure. Here we go. Here we go! (laughs) (laughs) oh, my God! (laughs) Here we go. Here we go. (engine roarg) The clouds and the-- oh, my God. We're turning. Oh, my God. (laughs) (both laugh) Ohh. Ali : Jesse can see that I'm a little bit nervous. Having someone that makes me feel safe In really scary situations is really comforting. I just thought that was so sweet, and I really appreciated it. Today I'm pulling out all the stops for Jesse... You--you made it. You made it. And I cannot wait to see the look on Jesse's face When he sees the next surprise. Ah, no big deal. I do this every day. (laughs) Remember how I said we were gonna live it up today? Yeah, yeah. Oh!

I feel more myself, because I know the guys now. I know what I'm walking into. I know there's some of you I haven't had time with yet, and I promise that will come, but, in general, I'm just really excited you guys are here. I feel like I got to know everyone a little bit better This week, which is a really good feeling, So... Whoo! Cheers to another cocktail party. (laughs) (clinking) I'm definitely feeling it. Three guys are gonna go home. There's some guys I know I want to stay, and there's others I need a little more time. We'll catch up tonight. Absolutely. Absolutely. But first I haven't had a date with This week, and right away, I want them to know, I'm thinking about you. How are you? I haven't seen you. What's up, Ali? How are y-- hey, how ya doin'? I'm good.

I want to get to know you. You know, um, every day these people come home With these great stories about you, and they're like, "oh, wait until you get to know her, Chris. She's awesome." I'm like--it's all this secondhand knowledge of you... Ohh. And I just haven't got anything yet, but... Yeah. I know. It's all right. No, no. Believe me, I completely understand. I'm sorry. Like-- Yeah. But all I know is we both say wicked." a wicked lot, yeah. And... A wicked lot. (laughs) oh, God. But yeah. Well... I really like that we have things in common, you know? Yeah. And--and Massachusetts... Yeah. And so what is life back home like? Um... I mean, I know Massachusetts, but-- yeah. I'm the oldest. Oldest? Yeah, I got two little brothers. Mm-hmm. It's like, I talk to them every day. Super close with your brothers? Super close. Oh, yeah, my family means so much to me. Like, you know, they are who I am. So yeah. Oh! Come to the cape. Come to the cape and hang out. (laughs) I would love that. Oh, man, I love it there, so... I'm really glad we had a chance to talk. Me, too. And, like, thank you for hanging in there this week, you know? No, no. Come on. I mean, honestly, it's not that bad To hang in here, and now I got a chance to talk to you, So it kind of made it worthwhile, yeah. Oh, good. I'm glad you feel that way. Give me a hug. Thank you. Come here. My pleasure. My Dad always said, find the commonality, Find the common ground. That's how you get to know someone, and, uh, I completely want a rose tonight Just for t chance of getting to know her better, Because it felt like butterflies talking to her. I'll see you in a little bit. All right, see you later. You know, I was, like, melting. Melting! This is our-- this is our dancing spot, Our salsa spot. (hunter) there he goes. Craig R. : his stomping grounds--his dancing grounds. Oh, man. Well, Roberto didn't go on the date this week. Do you think he's going for another dance? I don't know. Roberto got the first impression rose Right there the other night. Yeah? Um, you know, the fact that he's with her there right now In the same spot... Lightning never strikes twice. I'm so sorry I didn't get to see you this week. No, you're good. I-it's fine. I'm glad we're here, and we're good. I just like-- you look beautiful again. Aw, thank you. You're so nice. You're making me blush. No, like, you do. I'm just... Thank you. You're very, very, very handsome. (giggles) you're gorgeous. But, um... (laughs) what? Did I get you offtrack? No. I'm blushing. Oh. You're good. You're good. But... Ohh. Tell me everything I need to know about you. I--you'll learn about me. Like, I do a lot of stuff. Mm-hmm. Like, I travel the world. I play baseball. Wow. Yeah, so kind of crazy. I'm fascinated by this. It was cool. I played in college, and then I was drafted by the rockies and the twins. Oh, my God. Really good stuff. That's amazing. Yeah. But I've got my glove and stuff, If, and, like, if you want to play catch or whatever. (gasps) let's do it. You want to do it? For sure? Yes, I definitely want to do it. I just like Roberto. I do. I just think not only is he super good-looking, He is easy to talk to, and, you know, the first night here He taught me howo salsa. All right. Yeah! And tonight I find out he's a baseball player. I don't knowhe's just--I have such a great feeling for him. I've got the bigger glove, the smaller glove. Which one do you want? I think I'll take the smaller one. The smaller? All right. I pitched with this glove In college, so it's got some good luck in it. Oh, really? Roberto : growing up, you know, Baball was such a big part of my life. To find that girl who can go throw a baseball outside and she gets a little dirty, and then later that night... Yes! Can look elegant, I just--I just get excited. All right. You want to throw a knuckleball? Yeah. Put your fingernails, like, in between this. Mm-hmm. And then just, like, throw it and let it spin. I-I-I got this. It's like a shot put. Yeah, kind of like that. Okay. (laughs) just try. That was actually really good, 'cause that thing did not spin at all. Yes. That was awesome. I definitely feel some strong feelings starting to stir up. So if I don't get a rose tonight, You know, it'll definitely hurt, because, just, you know, Something about being around her feels right. Do you think that she actually already knows Who the final ten are gonna be? Man : absolutely. I think she knows what characteristics That she is looking for in the guys that we have here. Yeah, but I feel like, you know, she probably has an idea Of who's gonna be here for the, you know, for the end. For a while, yeah. I def--I agree with you on that. I agree with you on that. I think you're right. I'm crazy about Ali. I've missed her. I wanted to tell her that I missed her, and I want to tell her I've been thinking about her, and I just want it to be her and I again. Here. Are you cold? No, I'm good. It's a nice night. Okay. It's actually a beautiful night, and you look absolutely imaginar let me tell you, When you walked in in a white dress, I was like, oh! I am in a fairy tale. Come on. (laughs) Thank you. I feel good. I'm sorry we didn't get Time to chat... (sighs) you know what? You know-- At the end of the night. It was a long night. It's okay. No, it's cool. Like, I figured I'd get some time, so it's game time right now. I'm putting my game face on to tell you hey, I'm here to goad you out. You know that. That's number one. Thanks. That's number one. Hey. Kasey. You might--you-- (laughs) give me a hug. Oh, Frank. Take care of this girl, all right? I will come find you. Oh, will you? Yes. Okay. I didn't have any time this week--no one-on-one time. You know, I was like... (grunts) All right, that kind of stung a little bit. Ali : how are you doing? How have you been? I missed you. Have you? Give me a hug. Man : it looks like Frank's in there right now with Ali. For Frank to just go in and say, "yeah, you know, I got a rose, and you know, I'm not done yet," And just go kind of swoop in and steal her from Kasey, Who hasn't had his chance either, it's just-- It's frustrating... You know, as anything. It's tough. How's it--I mean, how have you been, though? 'cause I, I mean, I know what it's like, I mean, especially 'cause we had the first one-on-one date together, and it was amazing, and, um... All right, I can tell you exactly how I've been. Okay. (laughs) okay? I... I seriously left that night Feeling like... Ali's my girlfriend. Mm-hmm. And now I'm watching all these guys go on dates With my girlfriend, you know? Mm-hmm. And I love these guys, but not that much. (laughs) you don't... You know, it's, like... It was... Well, I'm glad you're in good spirits. You're still as funny as ever. (giggles) I'm really happy to see you. I missed you. Mm. He's kissing her right now. Man : oh, wow. Man : so this is it. Man : this is-- I'm gonna throw up. Yeah, that--that kind of gets me right there. Steve : there's a group of us standing there watching Ali kiss Frank, and I think we all kind of had the same, Uh, gut-wrenching feeling. Oh, I can't watch this. That's okay. John C. : it was tough to see that, you know? Because that's obviously indicative of how far along They are in their relationship thus far, Where I really haven't even had a chance to get to know her yet. (clears throat) they just finished. Figured that Frank would make a move at some point. At the end of the day, it's a competition. You've got 17 other guys who are gonna be vying For her attention, So I don't think anybody's gonna take a backseat tonight. Craig M. : weatherman? If you get your one-on-one, uh, with Ali tonight, Are you gonna try to make out with her or anything? (laughs) Jonathan : I hope Craig m. Is on the chopping block. I think that dude is off the charts in insanity. That guy is like... Who knows--I mean, his intentions are never good. He's been really passive-aggressive, Sometimes just, like, blatantly jabbing at my ego. Okay. His character is a zero out of ten. And that's it. I mean, he's not a good person, period. Do you resent Craig? Um, I don't know if it's resentment. I wouldn't think that's the appropriate... I just--look, man, I try to keep people who are, like, bad for me Out of my circle, that's all. I'm at the point where, It's like, I don't put up with them. If you're gonna try to make my life difficult, I'm not gonna allow you to do that. I'm like, "dude, I don't like you. I haven't liked you from day one." Man : I wish I could have been there. Oh, hey. He's really-- you look intent on-- You want to come over and hang out? Is that all you got? Jonathan : you know what? I don't want to hit anybody. I don't want to, but maybe it's a life lesson I've learned. I just don't screw around. If you get someone who's a jerk, You gotta learn to, um, protect yourself From those situations. (laughs) Frank : Craig and the weatherman have not liked each other From day one. That's obvious. And it kind of blew up yesterday When Craig did the whole weatherman fashion show. Man : anyway, cheers. But tonight I think the tension has kind of Escalated a little bit. Kasey : oh! We were just cheers-ing you. (laughs) Oh! Well, cheers. Cheers. You want to sit down? No, I'm actually gonna grab Jonathan. Okay. Man : oh. But thank you so much. Man : looks like the forecast is clear. How are you? (laughs) Hey. You want to go outside? Yeah, absolutely. I was so happy when she said, "I want to steal Jonathan away." I was like, Whoo! Whoo! Want to sit here? Yes. The last thing I think I want in life, at this moment, Is for Craig m. To get a rose tonight. So eye on the prize. Ali's the prize. The rose is the prize, and I want Craig m. Out of here. How's everything? I was thinking about you yesterday. Good. Were you really? And I wanted to know-- okay, that's great. I was thinking about you, Like, yesterday, too, yeah. Just a little? Just a little bit. How is how are things here? I don't--I don't really-- I don't put up with crap, so... Mm-hmm. I tell people, you know, what I think, and, uh, um, I mean, do you want to know just a little? Yeah. Okay. I mean, I don't want to-- I'm not--I'm not like, uh, Personally, like, I hate gossip, but at the same time, like, I understand the position you're in-- just tell me what's up. So, um... (laughs) there was, like, another moment Where it was like, oh, my God, give me a break, and he was like, "don't get up--don't get upset about it," And I said, "dude, I said, I don't like you. "I said I haven't liked you from day one, Okay, just don't touch me, you know?" But I'm like, you know what? There are good people in life, and there are bad people in life, and Craig-- He's dangerous. He's got some kind of, like, aggression. Like... (clears throat) I'm not--you know, I'm straight-up. Like, you shouldn't, um, allow bad people in-- Into your circle, into your surroundings... Mm-hmm. Period, 'cause you're just exposing yourself To getting hurt, so... Mm. I can't allow someone like that to be my friend, Or allow someone like at to be in Ali's life. That just wouldn't be right. So I just made it really clear That this is a dude to watch out for. Kirk : Craig m. Is very poor at reading the situation and reading how somebody else is feeling. Chris N. : mm-hmm. So if we've seen that with Craig m. Just with us, How does that translate with Ali? Ah, I don't know  I have not seen Craig express that he's here for Ali. Craig looks at me and goes,  "I gotta call in sick for work again tomorrow." Think he's gonna, you know, stick around tonight, Get a rose? I have no idea what Craig's like with Ali. So yeah, you must have heard crazy things about the house... (laughs) I heard there were some crazy things Going on back there. Um, you know what? There's 16 guys and you, obviously, Have seen that. Mm-hmm. Um... How do you feel about this whole situation? Are you comfortable in it? Are you uncomfortable? I'm here having a good time with the guys, and yeah, I am gonna have a good time with the guys. Right. But you know, on the other hand, I think you would think a lot differently If, you know, if it got to the point where we had A one-on-one date, you know what I mean? Mm-hmm. I think, you know, when I'm with someone that I like-- but do you like me? I'm kind of getting the feeling Like sometimes--and I-- and I mean this all, like, Just totally putting everything out there... Yeah. When I look at you, you will, like, look away. And so I'm asking, are you nervous or... You know, I want you--this is a two-way street, you know-- Well, I mean, obviously... Sure. Um, you know what? I feel like you seem a little bit uncomfortable. Are you? Really? I think, you know, I think the's-- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Like, your body language-- Your--your put--your legs are crossed away from me. You seem, like, a little reserved,  And I just keep thinking, does he want to get to know me more? Abs--you know, absolutely I want to get to know you more. But it's-- ask me anything. I don't know-- I don't know you, right? I mean, I'm--I'm--obviously, you're very attractive. But you say you want to get to know me, but you haven't asked me one question about myself. Well... Right now I have 16 other guys Showing me that they're interested in me. Yeah. So I'm just trying to understand you and, like, figure you out. I mean... I'm not... I don't know. I mean... Well, I-I don't know. I just can't figure out That you should--for instance, what's going on in the house. Yeah. Like, someone said to me, like, used the word, like, "dangerous" When referring to you. And I'm just wondering, why do you think... See, I don't know. I don't know... Someone would have said something like that? I don't know. Um... I guess what's in my head right now Is, you know, that I may be misunderstood, That, "hey, Craig seems like he's just here Having a good time." Mm-hmm. So, um... But, you know, I got that out. I got that out. But I think, yeah, you're, you know, if you give me The opportunity of us actually spending some time together, and I think that would totally change things, absolutely, 100%. Okay. Seriously. All right, good. I'm glad we had this talk. Absolutely. Absolutely. All right. (chuckles) Ah. Thank you, sir. Honestly, if I would guess who said I was dangerous, I'm--I'm assuming the weatherman said that. I'm gonna pull everyone aside and find out exactly Who said that about me. "this guy's dangerous!" Hey, uh, can I bring you guys in? Yeah. There's gonna be, like, a storm in the house tonight, Let's just say. Jonathan : this whole thing is stressing me out. I do not want to get in a fight. This dude is no good. Craig M. : hey, I just want to bring something-- Can you guys sit down for a sec? Craig m. Called all of us into-- to the same room in the house, So immediately I'm getting a little bit anxious, A little bit, like, nervous, like, what's going on here? Especially because Craig has been very unpredictable. Let's just start from the beginning. I had a chance--I had an opportunity with Ali, right? And, uh, she heard that someone said I was dangerous. I found it very... I mean, it kind of hit me pretty--pretty deep. So I just kind of want to know Who may have--would have said that about me. I-I feel--weatherman, do you want to talk about it? I don't think it really matters who said it. What do you mean, it wouldn't matter? It matters to you, but what does it matter In the scheme of things who said it? No, it does--what do you mean, it doesn't matter? You're asking people to talk about their--their talk-- Their conversation with Ali with you. I'm not asking that. I want to know who said dangerous." That's exactly what you're asking. You're just-- You're just--you know what? It's just how--it's just. Dude, that--if--if-- so that's obviously you, because you have a-a terrible rebuttal. I'm not--I'm not-- I'm not opposed-- I mean, I told you straight up I don't like you. So what does it matter who said anything? Seriously, dude. Sounds like you're trying to just say everything  But admitting it was you. I told you straight to your face. I said, I don't like you, haven't liked you. Everybod heard that. So-- those are strong words. It's not strong words. 'cause your intentions weren't good. You're a malicious person. Because I'm dangerous? Uh, no. I don't have this false sense of brothership with a jerk-off. I don't owe him anything. That's the point. I don't owe him anything, period. So it sounds like you can't admit that you said it. Admit? I told you straight up, man. I mean, how honest can somebody be? I'm not-- so it obviously means you said it. So that's all I want to know. There's no obvious," man. There's nothing obvious about it. No, no. So are you gonna say yes, you did it? 'cause if you did, then man up, and you-- I'm not gonna talk about any-- I've already-- People are pretty Clea that I'm not gonna talk... No, no. No, what do you mean you're not gonna talk... About my conversations with Ali.About anyone else sounds like you already have. I haven't talked about any of my conversations with Ali. For me, for sure, I feel pretty confident you did say that. My conversations with Ali are personal. So you don't want to talk about it? You don't want to talk about it? I've already told you how I feel If you were a man, you know, a little taller Or whatever else-- if you were a little taller... No. A man tells you straight-up that they don't like you, bro. If you were a man... Craig, you know what? Hold on. Craig, you know what? Just (bleep) take some accountability For your actions, dude. Stop blaming everybody else for your (bleep) problems, man. You've blamed three people here. You blamed Jesse for the (bleep) That you started with him. You bled him, man. Grow up, man. You're 34 years old. Seriously. First of all, I don't-- Take accountability for your actions. So hey, weatherman, weatherman. Before we end This conversation... Oh, absolutely. That's not why I'm here, man. I'm not here to-- weatherman, I don't know your first name. So before we end this conversation, You will not even--even though we all know it was you... I do not talk about my personal conversation. I've made it very clear about my conversation-- you still will not standing up and say, "yeah, it was me." That I don't like you? I've been very honest. What I said with... That has nothing to do with it. It's none of your business. All right. I'm just asking. And I've been very clear that my conversations with Ali are Nobody's business unless I want to talk about certain things.Iy the weatherman. No second guesses. It's for sure him. It's annoying that I have to deal with it In front of 15 other guys aside from him. I don't want to talk to him. Don't want to touch him. Don't want to shake his hand. Don't like him. Told him that. Go home. Hi, guys. I'm here for Ali. I'm certainly not here for Craig m. I think whoever called me dangerous-- I really hope they're gone. I mean, come on. I can just tell by looking at you you're gonna go. You're dangerous. (chuckles) (clinking) Sorry to break up the party, but, Ali, It's time for a rose ceremony. If you would come join me? See you guys in a little bit. (man speaks indistinctly) Craig m. Has asked to go home with his behavior, and he's asked to go home tonight. He deserves to go home tonight. So if Craig m. Gets a rose tonight, I will know for sure there is no God. Ali : after the dates this week, I've seen a lot of different sides to these guys. The first night, when I sent guys home at the rose ceremony, It was hard, and I didn't even really know them. And I know the guys now. So to send someone home is gonna be difficult. But I'm confident That if I just stay true to myself and go with my gut that I'm gonna make the right decisions and pick the guys that are right for me. Gentlemen, good evening. Men : good evening. Welcome to your second rose ceremony. A little different than the first. You've had a chance to start dating Ali, Get to know her better. Frank, Ty, Jesse, The three of you have already received roses. Nothing to worry about. As for the rest of you, 11 roses to hand out. Three of you will be going home tonight. Guys, I wish you all the best, and if you're ready, here's Ali. Chris. Where you're ready. Thank you. (sighs) um, I want to thank you guys for being here tonight. And tonight was exciting for me, 'cause I'm building connections with some of you, Which is exciting, and I don't want to see anybody go. But the point of this in the end is to be with one person, and this is just part of the process, so... ♪ Kasey. Kasey... Hi. Will you accept this rose? Absolutely. Okay. Thank you. Hunter. Hunter, will you accept this rose? Absolutely, babe. Thank you. Roberto. (whispers) excuse me. Roberto, will you accept this rose? Absolutely. Chris l. (chuckles) Chris, will you accept this rose?

If you did not receive a rose, Take a moment, say your good-byes. (speaking indistinctly) Take care. It was nice to meet you. Good luck on your search. Thank you. You, too. I did not see that coming at all. I got a weird feeling in my stomach. I'm like, did that just happen? I was actually nervous talking to her, and I'm never nervous when I talk to anyone, and that showed me I was, like, I was actually really into her. But, um, you know, if she doesn't feel it, it's not there. So I'm, uh, you know, I'm disappointed. Um, I'm... Yeah, I'm a little-- I'm pretty shocked. Thanks for the opportunity. There's a lot of-- A lot of guys here, so it's--it's tough. It's a tough call. Thank you. Absolutely. Take care. ♪ For Ali not giving me a rose, she missed a huge opportunity. I have a hard time respecting her decision On keeping the weatherman and, uh, the wrestler here-- I mean, over this? Come on. I-I just want to say good luck with the weatherman. Honestly, you can't be serious With someone who's shorter than you. I'll leave it at that. I mean, obviously there's plenty of women out there, and I'll get back in the sdle pretty quick. So I'm just hoping on the way back home There's a few attractive women flying back, 'cause I'm gonna need that extra attention. (sighs) so that was really hard. However, the good news is-- is that I'm one step closer To finding my future husband, and I feel really good and confident that he's here. So thank you, GU, for being here. We have a lot of fun dates plaed, and I'm excited that it's you guys. So cheers. Men : cheers. (glasses clink) next week on the bachelorette"... ♪ it's been ♪ (cheering) Man : this is so cool. These guys are my favorite band. With your help, we're gonna make the music video today. Man : action. Man : there's a lot of kissing. I mean, how could I not be jealous? Oh, my gosh. But she's also hugging you and kissing your neck. It's starting to kill me to watch these guys That I think might not be here for her. Man : Roberto is a lucky man right now. Are you ready to fall for me? Are you ready to fall for me? Let's go. I am. Let's go. Ali : oh, my God. I want to see who can make me feel safe. Aah! Roberto : whoa! Justin : it's actually crucial that I have Alone time with Ali. I wanted you to know The reason why I'm here-- it's for you. You know he came to my house, right? No. Roberto : to me, Justin's two-faced. (lowers voice) Justin walked over to her house yesterday. What? I don't trust your intentions. I'm 100% here for her. Man : he can have excuses all day long. Whoever has anything to say to me, bring it. Man : karma's a bitch. It's gonna come back at you. (crying) It's all coming up next week on the bachelorette." Look, I'm a professional wrestler, so... Chris N. : oh, all right. Man : Mr. Rated r." Justin : absolutely rated r." I don't know. How can he be, that seriously, an entertainment wrestler? (imitas pirate) I'm rated arr!
