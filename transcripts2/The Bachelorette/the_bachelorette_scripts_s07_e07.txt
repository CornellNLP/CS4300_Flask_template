 Tonight on... 
 Oh! Isn't this gorgeous? 
 Ashley : taiwan is absolutely beautiful. 
 Man : it's gorgeous. 
 It's unbelievable. 
 Ashley : hometowns are coming up, and I have to make some really tough decisions. 
 (train horn blows) 
 (laughs) this is awesome. 
 Ashley : I really need to see if there is An emotional and physical connection there. 
 That's the only way that I il go home and meet their families. 
 (ben) this is definitely right out of a fairy tale. 
 (J.P.) she and I have something amazing... 
 Where's ben? 
 Ben is still on his date. 
 (J.P.) but now ben just doesn't come home from a date, It's a total mind (bleep). 
 The--the more I don't know, the better off I will be. 
 I'm at the point where I care so much about her That I don't wanna see her with any other guy. 
 (laughs) 
 (J.P.) what the (bleep) going on? 
 I don't think this is going so well. 
 (Lucas) the other two guys are getting a little stressed. 
 Something's gonna happen. 
 How are you? 
 (l(lauge You just want ashley to yourself, you know? 
 (voice breaks) like, I wanna love someone unconditionally. 
 (groans) 
 (ashley crying) this is really hard for me. 
 Maybe I wasn't cut out for this, you know? 
 And then... 
 Not a day will go by That I don't regret how things have turned out. 
 The first time Emily finally speaks out About the state of her relationship with brad. 
 (voice breaks) I wanted it so bad, and, um, It's'sust really... 
 Heartbreaking. 
 It's all coming up tonight on... 
 ? 
 Ashley : taiwan is absolutely beautiful. 
 It's actually known as the hidden jewel of asia, Because not a lot of people know about it. 
 I love it, and I'm so excited to bring the guys here. 
 I really feel like I'm at a fresh start this week, and I'm putting the past in the past and starting new. 
 This is our last big destination in asia, and I'm looking forward to this week, 'cause I think It's gonna be very telling as to what's to come. 
 I have six amazing guys that are left with me here in taiwan. 
 We're going to taiwan to fall in love. 
 There we go. 
 Taiwan to fall in love. 
 Ryan has always been one of the guys That I've felt safe with. 
 I just love our conversations. 
 I love his energy. 
 Three countries in a very quick period of time. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm feeling really good about Lucas. 
 We had a great date together in hong kong, and he's just a real, genuine, great guy. 
 Ames is one of the most unique guys I've ever met. 
 He's so sweet, so intelligent. 
 I have no idea where we're going. 
 (Ryan laughs) 
 I love ben. He's funny, He has so many things going for him. 
 Constantine is just easy to talk to. 
 He's easy to look at, ananJ.P. 
 Just makes me feel comfortable. 
 He makes me feel secure. 
 Ryan : this is incredible! 
 Man : it's amazing! 
 Ashley : they're all so excited to be here. 
 They're really in it, and that means so much to me. 
 Ryan : sweet! 
 I'm ready to just move forward with the guys On this amazing journey. 
 I hope this week is a week of clarity, Because hometowns are coming up, and I have to make some really tough decisions. 
 I really need to see if there is An emotional and physical connection there. 
 I'm looking for the whole package. 
 That's the only way that I'll go home and meet their families. 
 Oh, look at that view! 
 There he is. 
 What's up, fellas? 
 Good to see you again. 
 Man : hey. 
 What's up? 
 How you doing, Chris? 
 Welcome to the beautiful city of taipei, taiwan. 
 As you can see behind me, 2011 marks the 100th anniversary celebration of taiwan, So we're very fortunate to be here right now. 
 Just six of you left. 
 This is a very important week. 
 The four of you who receive roses this week Will get the opportunity to take ashley Back to your hometowns to meet your friends and family-- 
 A huge step in a relationship. 
 So how do you get to be one of the fortunate four? 
 Well, let's talk about the dates. 
 This week, there will not be three,  But four dates-- 
 Three very romantic one-on-one dates and a group date. 
 There will only be a rose up for grabs on the group date. 
 So if you're on a one-on-one date, There's no rose, no pressure, just about you spending As much quality time with ashley As possible right now. 
 All right, go get settled into your hotel suite. 
 Ashley has left your first date card for you there. 
 Guys, enjoy taiwan, and I will see all of you at the next rose ceremony. 
 Man : all right. 
 Man : thanks. 
 ? 
 Two people get cut this week and then straight to hometowns, So the mood's a little bit more tense, but I'm feeling confident this week. 
 I think ashley and I have really made some bigger steps Than most, so, um, I feel--I feel good. 
 (chuckles) yeah. 
 Oh, man. 
 Man : whoo! 
 (laughs) 
 Man : oh, my god. 
 Man : nice. 
 Oh, man. That view. 
 (J.P.) there are three one-on-ones and a group date this week. 
 I don't like it. 
 I don't want other guys to go , Especially when she and I have this... Unbelievable connection. 
 I'm at another level with her, and so this week's gonna be really, really difficult for me. 
 It's already difficult for me. 
 I don't want to lose something I care about, and at this point, I'm as scared as I've been in a long, long time. 
 ? 
 Coming up... 
 (train horn blows) 
 (ben) the fact that there's not a rose on this date, It's no less pressure. 
 Ashley : so these are lanterns, and we're gonna put our love wish on both sides. 
 Okay. 
 Ashley : this was probably One of the most romantic nights of my life. 
 Oh, my god. Look at this. 
 Ashley : I like Ryan because he's just a positive person. 
 He has a great outlook on life. 
 Ryan : I think it's very possible she could be my wife. 
 I really wanna bring her home. 
 Ashley : with hometowns around t t corner, Time is running out. 
 I want you to know that this really hard. 
 And then.... 
 This was my worst nightmare. 
 Emily comes clean. 
 You know, you want something so bad and then it doesn't happen, D it's just... 
 Heartbreaking. 
 What happened? 
 Like, what went wrong? 
 (voice breaks) sorry. 
 (ben) a little date card. 
 Ryan : all right. 
 A little date card. 
 Date card. 
 Wow. 
 (ben) have a seat. 
 "constantine." 
 All right. 
 There we go. 
 Wow. 
 Nice. 
 Very. 
 "let your love light shine." 
 Let it shine. 
 "love, ashley." 
 I will catch you guys in a few. 
 Okay, buddy. 
 (J.P.) it's been a rough, rough week for me. 
 Right after my date in hong kong, I knew that I didn't want to go to another destination. 
 I just wanted it to be me and her, and watching constantine go on a date... 
 It's tough. 
 I just want to get through this week, Get to hometowns, bring her back to new york, and, you know, continue what we started. 
 There's no rose up for grabs, so... 
 Men : right. 
 You gotta wait the rest of the week to see if you get one. 
 Mm. 
 It's gonna be a rough week. 
 ? 
 So we're going out of town to a nice little village, So here's your ticket. 
 What? 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Ashley : I am so excited for this date today. 
 I think it's gonna be so much fun. 
 Constantine and I are taking a steam engine... 
 (whistle blows) 
 Into a tiny village right outside of taipei. 
 We're gonna have, like, a-a speed train? 
 Oh, you'll have to wait. 
 Our relationship is moving slower Than all the others, but I just see something there, and I want to be patient. 
 Are you excited? 
 Yeah, very excited. 
 (whistle blows) uh-oh. 
 (constantine) the fact that there's not a rose On this date-- it's no less pressure to me, Because she's gotta make big decisions in the next week, and she's gonna want to know Whether she wants to go meet my family, and I'll know if I want to introduce her to my family. 
 I just kinda want to enjoy, you know, One of these last dates before we get into hometowns. 
 Thank you. 
 I just really want to see if we can just relax and enjoy ourselves. 
 (whistle blows) 
 Ooh. 
 (chugging) 
 This is awesome. 
 (chuckles) 
 ? 
 Ashley : I think there's something romantic About a train ride. 
 He's holding my hand. 
 He's touching my leg. 
 I think we're off to a really good start. 
 We are back in time right now. 
 I know, right? 
 The jungle even. 
 This is incredible. 
 (constantine) riding on this train is awesome. 
 (whistle blows) 
 It was a great way to start the date. 
 It gave us some time to just hang out. 
 We were holding hands and we were just enjoying each other's company. 
 It felt good. 
 Are you looking for love on this trip? 
 Yes. 
 (whistle blowing) 
 We are going deep into the village. 
 I'm taking constantine to this adorable little village Called pingshi. 
 Ohh. 
 Hey. What's up? 
 I'm so excited to explore this town with him. 
 Oh! Thank you. 
 Every year there's a lantern festival here. 
 People paint their wishes on their lanterns... 
 Uh... 
 How cute. 
 At's awesome. 
 And once they release them into the air, The wishes come true. 
 Hello. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Man : ni hao. 
 Ni hao. So do you know what this is all about, constantine? (constantine) something about the lanterns. So these are lanterns, and what we're gonna do is We're gonna a t our love wish on both sides... Okay. And then we're gonna set them free into the sky, and our wishes are gonna come true. Oh, we're making a wish on here? Yeah. Okay. A love wish. Oh, okay. (constantine) I come from a family That's strong in tradition, Um, and it's neat to be, uh, immersed in this culture here. It's romantic, and it's just a cool way To, uh, spend some time with ashley. (constantine) hey, how would you do long--like, longevity? "2011 minus..." No, for, like, 2011 and on. Man. (gasps) longev--like, you know... Got it. Got it. I like that. You don't want it, like... I would love to have an opportunity... (laughs) To build a relationship with longevity Like my mom and my Dad have. (laughs) Lots of family. Family. Yeah, good one. Constantine is really taking this lantern thing seriously. It makes me feel like there's a potential future together. What about marriage? We could do rings. Yeah. (constantine) I really want to find somebody special. I really want to have that person fit into my life and fit into my family's life and to fit into my world. At this point, I'm very comfortable With the way things are going... Thank you. For love wish. Thank you, bud. And I'm looking forward to continuing to see If we can build on that. You're not gonna fire this thing off? Not yet. ? (doorbell rings, knock on door) Oh, boy. (chuckles) Date card. Nice. (chuckles) blood pressure, man. (ben) Ryan's got a lot to prove. He's made it this far without a one-on-one. (ben) I think it's almost too little, too late for Ryan. I'd like to think that they're not right for each other, Just based on the fact That nobody really gets along with him. And it says... "ben..." Ryan : ohh. "let's spend..." (laughs) "a 'gorges' day together in taiwan. Love, ashley." And gorges is spelled g-o-r-g-e-s. Nice. Some outdoor time, I think. Ryan : man, I want to be on that date, you know? These other guys are developing connections with ashley. I mean, it's starting to get to where You just want ashley to yourself, So I'm gonna do anything I possibly can To bring her home and introduce her to my family. Ashley's saving the best for last. I intend to set the tone going into this night. ? So, like, a big family-- Like, you know, I got a pretty big family. Yeah. They're not, like, intimidatingng You know, I think they're just kind of, like, fun and crazy. They-- are they loud? Very loud. Really? Like, how--like, do you think you're good with that? Like-- Absolutely. Well, if my grandfather cornered you and started, like, asking crazy questions to you-- That'd be fun. Yeah? I would love that. (constantine) I care about ashley a lot, but, you know, one step at a time, One day at a time, one date at a time. This is the homestretch before the hometown dates, and I'd like to know How she would fit in in my life. So why'd you bring me out here? I'm here for a reason. (laughs) I'm here this far. What--what have you seen-- what do you see in me? Well, physically you're exactly what I'm attracted to. I like that you hold back a little bit. You're not trying to convince me to like you Or you're not trying to sell yourself. You're just kinda being you. Yeah. And I love that you're a family man. I love, love, love that. That's cool. I think your answer is genuine as hell. I-I really do. I think, like, you see things in me That I want people to see in me.. Now I have a question for you. Mmmmmm. Do you think that you... Wouldn't let yourself fall Until after hometowns? For me, it's not necessarily hometowns. It's just gonna be that moment Where we both kinda feel like you're falling in love with me, and I'm falling in love with you. Mm-hmm. It--that would be, like, the main thing, but I think, like, hometowns are huge... Right. 'cause I think, even for you, like, You told me, when you went home, you were more yourself. You remember everything I say. It was important, right? (chuckles) yeah, that's important. Yeah. That's good. Well, I remember when you said you went home, You were more yourself that day Than you were, like, the entire time around brad... Mm-hmm. And so I almost feel that way, too. Like, you're seeing a good bit of me, but I really feel like all of me is what you'll see If you decide to go back to atlanta with me. Mm-hmm. So that's, like, a huge thing... Mm-hmm. Um, both mentally for me and then for you, too. Like, you'd have to see what my family is about, Because that's, like, a huge part of me... Right. And that will be a part of your life if that's... Mm-hmm. If we get to that point. If things keep going well, Do you think that this could possibly work for you? If I fall in love. You know, like, I realize I might move a little slow, but I think, like, if--if we're really in love... Mm-hmm. By the end of thth and we both know that, Then we have as good a chance To make this work as anybody else does, and I think for me it's just gonna be that moment Where we both kinda feel like it just-- Happens, yeah. It's--it just happens for you, and--and you can't-- you can't force it, and you can't speed it up, and you can't slow it down. It just-t- it's out of nowhere. When it does, like, you just kinda put your-- You know, you just-- you fall in love, and everything else kinda just doesn't matter. Mm-hmm. That's, like, what a powerful emotion love is. You never know when you're-- it's gonna hit you, That the person that you're with, You know, is gonna be the person that could see yourself with The rest of your life. This has turned a corner at the perfect time. We're at the point in our relationship Where I feel like, you know, I'm ready to take that next step. You got it? Let's hope this doesn't backfire. Yay! Bye, love wish. (constantine whistles) Do you think our wishes will come true? They definitely will come true. ? Ashley : I saw a lot of things That I loved in constantine tonight. This date was a huge breakthrough for us. I feel like our relationship has really moved forward, and I'm really excited to see what happens next. Thank you. Perfect. Perfect. (gasps) there's a bunch of 'em. Oh, my god. Look at this. This is amazing. That's beautiful. It gorgeous. It's unbelievable. This is the most romantic thing I think I've ever been a part of. Isn't it? (constantine) I-I just stopped mid-conversation When just--I couldn't believe the scenery here. It is one of the most spectacular things I've ever seen. And people are seeing this r miles around. Doesn't that look beautiful in the dark sky? Literally, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen. I know. Ashley : this was probably one of the most romantic nights Of my life. I'm so happy that I connected with constantine tonight. Look at ours. So that's ours. (constantine) I love that. I love that it's doing its own thing, Still burning strong, Still doing-- still burning strong. Still doing well. That's awesome. What a wonderful night. Thank you so much. Mm. You're welcome. (constantine) I'm so excited. All I want to do is take ashley back to see my family. I'm--I'm hopeful. I'm open to the idea of marrying this girl. I'm ready to just share my life. I've never been-- I've never been happier. Coming up... Whee! (laughs) honk the horn. Ashley : but you're happy, right? Happier than I've been in a long time. (ben) standing here and holding ashley feels right. Oh, isn't this gorgeous? Ashley : I feel like he's my boyfriend. Where's ben? I haven't seen him all morning. Ben is still on his date. (J.P.) it's a total mind (bleep) To having to share her with other guys. Don't want to think about it. Don't want to talk about it. Ben just doesn't come home from a date. Like, what the (bleep) is going on? Welcome. How are you? Thanks. Good. How are you? It's good to see you. You, too.. Ashley : on our last date together in thailand, Ben showed me that he's ready to have a serious relationship, but the truth is, I am dating multiple men, and I have very strong feelings for a couple guys, ben included, and this week I really need to see If there is an emotional and physical connection there. I'm lookingg for the whole package. That's the only way that I'll go home and meet his family. So we're pretty much gonna explore the park today.... Awesome. But I have a really cool way we're getting around. How is that? Oh! Moped! Those are cool. All right. That's awesome. (laughs) I'm so excited. We're gonna have fun. All right. All right. Ohh. (ben) I have high hopes for today. I see myself heading down this path with ashley That I haven't been down in a long time, and it's exciting. Let me do it for you. Mm. You're so sweet. Better? I think that we've had a wonderful time Up to this point, and I'm really looking forward To what today has in store for us. Oh, harry and lloyd. Vroom, vroom! Whee! Honk the horn. (honks horn) (laughs) I want her to meet my family and my friends and see what my life is like, and I have a really good feeling About how this is gonna turn out. We're going places. We're going places. ? (horn honks) (ashley laughs) oh, this is awesome. (ben) it's pretty in here. Yeah, isn't it? Vroom, vroom. Hellllf a second date, kiddo. (chuckles) Ashley : riding through taroko gorge with ben is breathtaking. We're going through the curvy roads, and even though it could be a little dangerous, I felt protected. I felt like he was the man, and I love that. Okay. Keep your eyes on the road, buddy. It's hard with the precious cargo I have behind me. (gasps) (slaps back) Oh, another one. You're such a sweet talker. I know. I'm good at it. (high-pitched voice) you're so cute. You're just so cute. I'm good at it. You're just so cute. (ben) it feels natural to have ashley's arms wrapped around me. Wind blowing in our hair, riding around on the scooter together-- This is definitely right out of a fairy tale. But you're happy, right? I'm happier than I've been in a long time. Whoa. (horn honks) (hums) That was a long ride. This one? (grunts) oh, isn't this gorgeous? It's really pretty. Mm. (kissing) (ben) standing here and holding ashley feels right, and it's the first time it's felt right In a long time for me, So I'm genuinely happy. Mm. ? This is a scary week. I know personally I've had trouble sleeping The last two nights. It's really getting to me. (knock on door) go get it. Oh, man. I'll get that for you, fellas. Ohh. Here we go again. Ryan : this next card's huge, Because the next date card is gonna say who's on the group date, and whoever is not going on the group date gets The one-on-one date, and I haven't had a one-on-one yet. I've been on every single group date except for vegas. This is the most critical week yet. I need to get a one-on-one date with ashley. I need to spend the time with her. I'm grooming you for the big day. Lucas... "ames... And J.P." Ohh! All right. (laughs) oh. (J.P.) going on his first one-on-one... (Lucas) yeah. Assuming you get it tomorrow. Ohh. Can I see that, please, Make sure my name's not on it? You can verify. It's true. It's exciting. I can't stop my mind thinking and feeling and what's coming and, like, just-- There's a whole bunch of energy running through me, and I'm just not able to turn it off. (laughs) (Lucas) you know, Ryan has a very h hh energy level. It gets kind of annoying around all of us. Ryan and ashley, I guess, are having some other connection That I'm really not seeing, but I honestly think That they're definitely not right for each other. ? (engine whirring) (ben) I am falling in love with ashley, but I'm not ready to tell her yet. I'm excited for dinner. Me, too. Look at this view. How gorgeous is this? (ben) my feelings are getting stronger, and I want to say it when the time is right. Ashley : can you please look around right now? (ben) yeah, and it was an incredible day. (glasses clink) It's lovely. What do you think of the wine? Lovely. It's good, huh? Yeah. It's nice. Kinda tastes like the wine That you brought me the first night. It's close to mine. Mm-hmm. There are some differences. Okay. We'll touch on that in the hometowns. All right. Whoa! (chuckles) Uh-huh. So you're feeling pretty confident. I feel good about a hometown date. (laughs) I will say, I do. What if we get there and your family is, you know, apprehenenve about things and, like, what if they are skeptical? My mother-- Like, how would that affect our relationship? My mother and my sister's opinions matter greatly to me. Mm-hmm. They do, and I think that after they see us, That everything will be fine and they'll know that I'm serious about this. You are serious about this? I am serious about this. Good. Yeah. Makes me happy. Now what are you hoping to get out of the hometown date? I'd like to see our--our relationship Kind of... Go to the next step, go to the next level... Mm-hmm. You know? 'cause you've kind of got me... In this place. You've got me... (chuckleses probably where you-- Where you want me, where, like... (chuckles) what does that mean? I'm, like--I'm, like-- I'm just, like-- I'm on the tipping point. I'm on, like, the teetering point Of, um, having stronger feelings than just liking you... Mm-hmm. And so after the hometown date, I would like it to progress to that point. Mm-hmm. It's scary for me a little bit, Because I don't throw The--uh, what I like to call the l" bomb... Mm-hmm. The love" word around often. It's only happened a few times... Mm-hmm. So I'm cautious about who I say it to, and when I say it, it means a lot, So... Yeah. And a lot of it kind of all came, like, Pouring in today when we were riding around On that--that litttt scooter, you know? Like, this is-- This is good, and it feels right... Mm-hmm. And I'm ready to open up again. I-I want to tell you that I remember and cherish the moments that we-- We're spending together, The little things that kinda keep me going Throughout this whole process. You know, riding on the moped and walking through the market and, um, you know, Kissing you here and kissing you theree and getting little butterflies in my stomach. Mm-hmm. Um, those are feelings that I havenen felt In a very long time, and I think that ultimately My mom and my sister will see that, You know, if-- if you come home to sonoma. ? (ben) there's no emotional barriers anymore. The walls have been broken because of ashley. There are true feelings between ashley and I. I really--I care for her. I really do. I'm glad I'm starting to fall in love. ? (kiss) Ashley : I think that I might be falling in love with ben. I see ben in the same light that I saw him on our last date, Which is--I feel, like, more comfortable, and I feel like I know him, and I feel like we actually-- I feel like he's my boyfriend. That's honestly how I feel. Coming up... Ashley : we're gonna be taking weddddg photos. (J.P.) I'm at the point where I care so much about here That I don't want to see her with any other guy. (laughs) Group dates suck. How are you? (giggles) Ryan : it's starting to get to where You just want ashley to yourself. I want you to know that this is really hard. Ryan : I wanna love someone unconditionally. And then... Where does your relationship with brad stand right now? He's... Sorry. An emotional Emily finally breaks her silence. I wish I would've known Or that we could've done something different. And, I promise, nobody's more disappointed about it than I am. Where's ben? I haven't seen him all morning. Ben is still on his date. Really? Wow. That's pretty big. I don't think J.P.'s doing too well with it. Oh. (chuckles) (Lucas) ben went on a date yesterday. We woke up this morning, and he's not in his bed. J.P.'s upset. When he's silent, That means he's getting-- he's getting kind of irritated, and I get the pleasure of going on a group date with him. (constantine) if you leave-- what if he doesn't come back Before you guys leave for your, uh, for your date? You ain't getting nothin' out of me. (chuckles) I don't-- I'm not talking about it. Don't want to think about it. Don't want to talk about it. I don't give a (bleep), so... The last time I spent with ashley was in hong kong, and she and I have something amazing, and now that ben just doesn't come home from a date, Like, what the (bleep) going on? (chuckles) you're causing trouble. Man : oh, my. Man : ohh. Man : hey. Oh, hey, boys. What is up? Mr. 24 hours! (chuckles) mr. All-nighter himself. More like 36. (chuckles) oh, take it easy. Well, well. No. It was good. Did you guys do any physical activities Like body surfing or... No. No. None of that stuff. Nothing? Nothing physical? Nothing physical... (chuckles) That you need to know about. Yeah, it was a great date. Well done. I didn't think I was spending the night, either. How was breakfast? It was nice. I had a nice time. (Lucas) it sounds like it. (laughs) What have you guys been doing? Talking about you, buddy. (laughs) Yeah, I bet. With the big unspoken elephant in the room, It seems like you guys did not share a room. We did not share a room. No. Yeah. (J.P.) it's a total mind (bleep) To having to share her with other guys While I feel this way, Because how do you go from something like our one-on-one To having a guy out and him not coming home in the morning? I think it sucks. I've accepted that this week was just a group d de for me, and I'm hoping that it's not romantic at all For the other guys. (mendelssohn's wedding March From 'midsummer night's dream'" playing) Ashley : the people in taiwan love their weddings, Especially wedding photos, and there's actually a district here in taipei... (camera shutter clicking) where people travel from all over asia To have their wedding photos taken, So we're gonna explore this tradition today. What are we gonna be doing, boys? Taking wedding photos today kinda makes This whole experience so much more real. Ashley : welcome. Thank you so much. Nice to see you. I mean, one of these guys could be my husband one day, So this could show me What it would be like to get married to each of them. So today we're gonna be taking wedding photos. All right. Cool. Nice. Absolutely. Are you guys excited? Yeah. For sure. Yeah. Very. I'm so excited. It's gonna be really fun. Um... (J.P.) wedding photos. This is exactly what I was afraid of. I mean, yeah, it's hard for me. I don't want to see her in a wedding dress With any other guy. So I'll have you guys go in your changing rooms and put on your outfits... Great. Okay. And I'll put on mine. Ashley : I'm excited to see how the guys go along with today. I know we're wearing some pretty interesting apparel, So I think it's gonna be, um, pretty cool To see how they look. (laughs) Wow. That's very becoming. It's very slimming, at least. Ashley : there's definitely a big picture With this date today. I mean, we'r'rtaking wedding photos. Are these guys ready to take wedding pictures? Will they look cute in wedding pictures? (J.P.) oh. (both laugh) That looks good. Ohh. (chuckles) (J.P.) so Lucas steps out in this gold thing. It looked like a dress up to his neck, and then ames looks like The offspring of an ostrich and elton john, So I'm thinking, mine's gotta be the worst one in there. (Lucas) come on, p. (J.P.) it's a little small. Yours better be bad. ? Oh, my god. (chuckles) What up with that, man? Well, the pants are long, and the jacket's too tight, If it makes you feel any better. Mm. Sorry. (Lucas) you know, J.P.'s been pouting quite a bit About ben not coming home. He wouldn't talk. He was just cranky. He was m mdy. He comom out-- His whole attitude changes when he gets that tuxedo on. Ohh. (bleep) group dates suck. (laughs) Eh, they're not so bad. If he would've had my outfit or ames' outfit on today, Oh, my gosh. He would've just thrown a fit Like a, you know, like a 15-year-old, So that's irritating. Hi, guys. (laughs) (chuckles) hi. Hi. Wow. You guys look g-- I think you look good. Ashley : the guys look really cute, and the most important thing is, they're playing along with it. I think everybody's just gonna have a lot of fun with this. ? (camera shutter clicking) How romantic. Man : smile. Ashley : my photo shoot with Lucas was A traditional taiwanese setup, and because he's j jt a traditional southern guy, I thought maybe this would be best suited for him. Woman : smile. Man : smile a little bit. Ashley : smile, Lucas. ♪ smile ♪ (Lucas) I'm smiling. Hey. You're supposed to be happy. I am happy. (laughter) Hey. Ah! (laughs) Right. Man : right. Kiss her. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Hey. Oh. Whoa. Yes. Okay now. One more. Look. Look. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. Not yet. One more. One more. Hey. Hey. Beautiful. Wonderful. (J.P.) it's been a rough, rough week for me. Okay. Changing clothes. Ashley : all right, ames. I'm ready. Watching constantine go on a date, Having ben not come home from a date... (camera shutter clicks) And then to watch ashley kiss ames and Lucas At that photo shoot-- all not good things. Bad, bad, bad. And then we had our photo shoot. And the most-- northeast coast. Uh-huh. All right. Ah. Mm-hmm. All right. Let's do this. Man : how do you want us to stand? (camera shutter clicks) Ashley : J.P. Lucked out with this date. He's sporting a traditional tux, and he looks great. The pressure is on, Because he's the one that's in the most traditional outfit For us. Smile. Man : smile. (camera shutter clicking) Smile! Yeah. Yeah. Smile! Be happy. Uh... (chuckles) Be happy! Big smile. Man : smile! Smile! (laughs) I was smiling. That's all I do. (laughs) Yeah. Good. (laughs) (camera shutter clicks) (J.P.) group dates suck. It's uncomfortable. The high from my one-on-one has come down. Does this make you nervous, all this wedding stuff? (lowered voice) I don't think This is going so well personally. (chuckles) I mean, just based on listening. These are gonna be the worst pictures. (laughs) (laughs) (J.P.) I just want some answers, and I want to move forward. I know what we have is real, but I'm ready for this group date to be over. How'd that feel? Awful. Ashley : are you guys excited? (ames) yeah. Absolutely. (Lucas) very. (J.P.) today's group date sucked. Having to watch ames and Lucas kiss her During the photo shoot-- it took a toll. I'm at the point where I care so much about her That I don't want to see her with any other guy, and I certainly don't want to see her Taking wedding pictures with the other guys. Look at this. Oh, look at the pictures. Guys, our pictures. Look at these. (laughs) wow. (J.P.) it kills me, and it's because I'm falling for her. Nice. (chuckles) Whoa. Ashley : today was supposos to be fun, but the guys definitely didn't have as much fun As I hoped they would've. Are you guys hungry? Not really. Yeah. Ashley : I totally understand why. I mean, there's a rose on this date. Hometowns are looming, and there's a lot of pressure. There's a lot of pressure today. Ashley : that's a hometown date rose. That is meeting somebody's mama and daddy. You know, that's... Ashley : I can really relate To what the guys are going through. When I was dating brad, I remember that small group date. Emotions were running high. I just want to help them to relax. You know, I got that rose when I was-- (Lucas) yeah. For sure. (ames) at the ballet? You did? How'd that feel? It felt good. Yeah? It wasn't the greatest group date, but, you know,w, it's crunch time tonight. I want her to come home and meet my family. I want her to see who I really am, you know? Did you have fun today? I had fun. Uh-oh. What does that mean? I had fun. Uh... Let me sit closer to you. Yeah. Please. Um... I just felt kinda... Kinda foolish over in the corner. Aw. I don't want you to feel that way. No. I know. I know it was all, like-- This was the cultural... -Hmm. How people do thingsgs but I'm a traditional type guy, and there's J.P. In a tux, There's you in a beautiful white gown With flowers, and I was like, I'm sitting over there in a dress. Funny? Yeah. It's not a dress. So, I mean, it's just-- It's a long shirt. I guess it's more of a... Yeah. I don't know. I don't know, so I had an okay time. An okay time? Yeah. Mm. I'm always honest with you, so... That doesn't make--yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. No. I was looking forward to this. This is, you know... Yeah. If I get the opportunity to take you home, I would love to. I would-- yeah. That's just, uh, a growing step with us... Mm-hmm. And bringing a woman home is-- That's a big deal. It's a big step, you know? It is a big deal. So here's a question I have for you. Do you think that bringing me-- Because you were married in the past... Mm-hmm. Is that gonna be weird, Bringing me home to your family? It's been almost three years. Mm-hmm. Um, they're just ready for me to be happy again, So-- and they're just so cool. Okay. They're just so-- You think I'd fit in? Yeah. Yeah. You think it's gonna be hard to marry a second time? No. I would love-- I want kids. Mm-hmm. I really do. I just miss the simple life. Mm-hmm. You know, just have fun, look over in your bed and say, "wow, I'm married to her, you know. We're--it's gonna be a good day, so..." I love that. (Lucas) today was definitely my least favorite group date, but, uh, we had a good conversation. It got--it got pretty deep, So I can just already see ashley walking into my parents' home and just giddy and smiling and vice versa to my parents. They're gonna be just crazy and having a good time, and, uh, I hate jinxing myself, but I feel confident I'm getting a rose tonight. ? I don't see J.P. Coming home with the rose tonight. U think Lucas is getting it? I do. (knock on door) Hey. Here we go, ry. Moment of truth. Yeah. (chuckles) Oh, boy. (clears throat) (chuckles) my name better be on that card. (door closes) Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Ohh. "Ryan..." "let's get a taste of taipei." Oh, boy. "love, ashley." Ryan : I'm frickin' pumped. I mean, the wait and the anticipation and the sleepless nights-- It's all culminating to this. I mean, it's just bursting inside of me now. Congratulations. (chuckles) let me see it. A taste of taipei. Well, it sounds like we're gonna just hang out and talk. It sounds great. I'm gonna sleep with this thing right next to me, like... (chuckles) This is my, uh, mother. Oh, , good-- this is your mother? That's my mother. She's so pretty. Totally. This is a school picture... Oh, my god. (laughs) When I was very young, and I just took it out of the frame, so... Yeah, I was very, uh, unpopular Until I was maybe 16. Like, I was just the quiet type, but then it gave me, like, greater humility and understanding for, like, you know... Right, and look at you now. I'm happy that you turned out the way you are, 'cause you're a very unique guy. I know it. I've never met anyone like you. Thank you. Mm-hmm. That's very exciting, actually. Yeah. I love seeing where people are from, Or, you know, what made them become who they are. Right. I love that. Absolutely. Mm-hmm. We're genuinely a really happy family. I know you'd love them, and I know they'd love you. I could've not possibly hoped For, uh, somebody as, like, well-rounded as you, You know, like, Beautiful and charming... Thank you, ames. And, uh, and I think it would be totally fun and fantastic. I've gone from rationalizing My relationship with ashley and thinking through why it works so well To just feeling that it works, which is fantastic. Today on the date, it was a chance For ashley to see that I'm the right guy for her Over the other guys, So I feel fantastic. My relationship with ashley couldn't be better. This week has been really, really, really hard. We-- I mean, coming off hong kong, Like, that was probably the most unbelievable night ever. It was a little wild. But it was amazing, and that night it kinda reached another level for me. It realllldid. Mm-hmm. Then... (chuckles) To watch you go out with three other guys this week... Mm-hmm. I just don't want to do it. I mean, I know-- I get this is how it works, but I don't want to do it. Mm-hmm. Ben doesn't come home in the morning... (chuckles) and then we're at this photo shoot, and Lucas goes first, and of course you have to kiss him in the photo shoot. I'm like, great. Perfect ending to a great week. (laughs) So it's just been absolutely terrible. Really? Yeah. I--yeah. I was not in a good mood today, yesterday, Didn't want to talk, 'cause I don't know anything that's going on, and, like, all I have is time to think about things... Mm-hmm. And--and it-- it made me crazy. It really made me crazy. Really? Yeah. Like, a bad crazy? I guess it's jealousy, but, like... Mm-hmm. I think it's kinda n nmal. I mean, I should be jealous. Right. You're not getting angry at people, and you're not... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Getting in fights or anything like that. No, no, no. What would be the point of that? I mean, you know, maybe conversations have started up Where I'm like, "yeah, I don't want to talk." See, I thought you were just cool as a cucumber. I mean, 'cause in the past weeks, You--you said, "yeah, this is what I signed up for." (sighs) yeah, I know what I said. Right? I know what I said. It sounds great in theory... Mm-hmm. But when you feel this way about someone, you know, That changes everything. It changes everything. 
 
 ? Um, all right. I am going to-- I'll be right back, okay? Sure. (J.P.) ashley and I were talking and then she got up and left, So I have a million thoughts That are running through my head. I just wanted her to tell me what--what's going on. Hi, sweetie. Hi. Are you guys staring at those pictures? We're-- yeah, absolutely. I'll be right back. Please do. Okay. There went the rose. I feel like, at this moment, for the first time, This is completely out of our hands. I put, like, everything out there today. Yeah. So... I was just thinking. Mm-hmm. I know you, of all the people here, Are, like, a really strong man With a good head on your shoulders, and to hear that you were having a really hard week, It really broke my heart, but I also feel your pain, 'cause I-I was there, and I want you to-- To, you know, get through these hard times, Because I think that there's a good possibility That good things could come from it, So I want to meet your family so bad. I can't wait for you to meet them. So, J.P., will you accept this rose? Definitely. Yay. (J.P.) I feel back on cloud nine. Got the rose at the group date. I'm not gonna lie. It's a great feeling. I can't wait for her to meet the family. Hi. Ashley : hi. Hi. Congratulations. Congrats, J.P. (J.P.) thank you. (ames) I was pretty disappointed not to get the rose. I really like this girl. I mean, we've got a rose ceremony coming up With enormous stakes. I really want to bring ashley home. This is a big deal. Ashley : cheers, guys. To tomorrow. (clink) Right. A good day. (Lucas) it was a aummer seeing J.P. Get the rose. You know, I thought we had a great conversation, and yet I guess it wasn't as great as I thought it was, but I would love for her to come meet my family, and, uh, I'm not ready to go home yet. ? Coming up... Ryan : if things go well, I'm going to be bringing ashley home to meet my family. Look, you'u' my perfect guy. In my head, you're my perfect guy. Ryan : I wanna love someone unconditionally. Ashley : maybe I wasn't cut out for this, you know? Ashley : everybody keeps talking about Ryan's personality and how it's so over-the-top, but I don't care what anybody says about him. I like him, and I've liked him from the beginning. He was my first impression rose. (laughs) I like Ryan because he's just a positive person. He has a great outlook on life. He's successful. He's gorgeous. He's the sweetest guy. He makes me feel really special, but at the end of the day, is there that connection there? And before I get family involved, That's what I need to figure out today. (laughs) it's good to see you. It's great to see you. What's up? Hi, darlin'. (chuckles) you look great. You, too. (chuckles) wow, huh? Oh, my gosh. Can you believe this? God, I am so happy to be here. Yeah? The date card came and... Mm-hmm. And I'm, like, my heart's beating out of my chest. Oh, no. (chuckles) Then you know what was so cool? My name was finally called, and d w I'm just so calm. I slept so great last night. Really? Finally. You're finally calm? Yeah, can you believe it? No way. I promise you. (both laugh) Yeah. Ryan : when I'm with ashley, It's like everything else disappears, Especially today, 'cause there's no rose on this date, Which means I really don't have to think about that. I just get to focus on ashley and I having fun here in taipei. (chanting in chinese dialect) Isn't this crazy? Praying to all the different gods. Isn't this amazing? This is. This is. Ryan : ashley takes me to longshan temple. I've never felt like-- anything like it in my life. Hundreds of people singing chants, Praying with all of their soul. (chanting continues) There was something really romantic and intimate About experiencing this with her. Going through this, more than ever, Has made me just realize how bad I'm yearning To just focus my life on one person, To build a partnership for life. Ashley : that's the matchmaking god. Ryan : really? Mm-hmm, so hold on to these bricks... Yes. And you make a wish to the matchmaking god, and then you throw the bricks down. They have to turn up opposites In order for your wish to come true. (chuckles) oh, boy. I was thinking that you could take one, and I'll take one, and we'll both make our wishes. Ryan : I didn't tell her my wish, but if it comes true, we have a happy future a aad. (clatter) (Ryan and d hley gasp) Ryan : and those things land on the same side. I'm like, dang, that's not good. I was like, Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Ohh. Ohh. (Ryan sighs) well... Ashley : ohh. You know, down deep I'm like, it's all right. Maybe I'm a fool to be optimistic, but I feel good about building a relationship and spending a life together. Now we get to just enjoy The rest of the afternoon and the evening. I'm looking forward to it. (chanting continues) ? Ohh. Look at this. It looks so beautiful. With--with all the tai chi experts. Look at 'em down there. I wish I knew more about tai chi. It is a physical thing? Is it mental? I think I'm gonna expose-- okay, I-- probably a little of both. I really don't know all the details of it... I don't know either. But I know it's a form Of dance/martial arts/it's the movement of feeling energy. You know, they basically are gagaering energy. In with the good... Mm-hmm. You know, out with the bad, and--and, um... Oh, that's so cool. It's really being in tune. That's like you. It's, likekespiritual-- that's like your personality Or your outlook. Absolutely. Yeah, and look at that. Mm-hmm. Is it--this is the first time I've seen the sun Since we've been here. The sun! (laughs) maybe there's a little bit of coincidence there. Maybe. (chuckles) we finally have our date, and the sun comes out. Mm-hmm. Mm. Ashley : I like Ryan Because he's just a positive person. He has a great outlook on life, but at the end of the day, I just don't know if he's my husband. I don't know if I feel That--that romantic connection with him. I mean, I gotta tell... (sighs) Seeing these new cultures, these new places, Getting to know you on such a short timeline. Mm-hmm. Um... The fact that you're about to come home and meet my family hopefully. Hopefully. (chuckles) (chuckles) Ashley : I'm not sure that I'm ready to meet Ryan's family. I don't feel like our relationship Has moved far enough for me to feel comfortable doing that, and I don't know how to handle this. Yeah. It's crazy. ? Come to our final casting event July 22nd in san diego. To find out more, go to bachelor.Abc.Com. Oh, look at the koi in there. These things are huge! Yeah, these are huge. (laughs) (laughs) (chuckles) ohh. No. Oh, look. Oh, wow. Oh, these... This day has exceeded all expectations. Spending it just with ashley, her and I, Really getting the full flavor of taipei, taiwan... Well, what do we have in store, huh? Just a little picnic I planned. Just a little picnic. Mm-hmm. And what a day. I feel amazing. Like, I'm on cloud nine. Cloud ten. At the end of this date, things go well, I'm going to be bringing ashley home to meet my family. I really want to bring her home. Ah. (chuckles) Ooh. A little dim sum. (chuckles) water in the background... I know. Fish all around. Look at this little guy here. Look at this. (chuckles) Oh, boy. Cute. Yeah. Um, okay, so tell me, you know, I mean, you know this-- this is a loaded question, but, you know, I mean, heck, I'm in the solar industry. I care about the environment. Yeah. I love the outdoors, all that sort of stuff. Mm-hmm. Like, I mean, what's your thought on that stuff? I mean, what sort of stuff Do you do for the environment or do you think about? I mean... Actually I have a funny story. It's not funny. Bring it. I'm kind of ashamed of it, but I was dating a guy, and I had a plastic bottle... Yeah. And I threw it away, Ananhe stormed out of my apartment and said that we were not compatible, Because I threw a plastic bottle-- shush. Yeah. Oh, boy. Yeah. He was--he was off the-- (laughs) he was one end-- So that made me reconsider my lifestyle... Oh, my gosh. But, um, to be honest, I don't have much knowledge, but I'm appreciative of people like you. I'm also not a, you know, crazy lunatic About the whole thing, but-- Well, why don't you teach me something right now? Well, we'll work together. Like, something I can take away from this. Okay. Have I talked to you about water heaters? No. Okay, so water heaters-- Most water heaters throughout the country If you think about it, they have big tanks, right? Okay. Mm-hmm. They sit in your garage or wherever. E water heater, you know? Okay. You take your shower or whatever. You take too long of a shower, it runs out of water, but your water heater-- heats it all day. What's it doing right now as you're away? It's heating water... Right. Using natural gas to heat water... Mm-hmm. All day, every day... Ashley : Ryan's so great. He's gorgeous, smart, successful, Has such a positive outlook on life, but I really feel like I'm still waiting for that moment For me to really feel like there could be a relationship there. You only need the hot water when you take your shower Or wash dishes or whatever, right? Mm-hmm. You know, the truth is, I feel a passion with some of the other guys, and that's something I'm not feeling with Ryan. And why doesn't every house have a tankless water heater? Yeah. I'll think about that when I, uh... Okay, so there's something. Build a house one day. With hometowns around the corner, Time is running out. I have to make this decision now. What would your-- What does your family think about all this? What--are they--would they be supportive if we-- Totally. Yeah? My mom knows that I really want to find someone. Mm-hmm. Like, I can picture-- You come home, and to introduce you to my parents, Like, walking in the door, and the dogs would be going crazy. Mom will be there and give you a big hug, and my Dad will be there, and he'll probably just give you a huge hug. I want you to see what it's like with my family. Mm-hmm. You know? I'm just looking forward to showing you What's such a huge part of my life. Yeah. No, honestly... (sighs) this, um... I... You know, when I gave you that first impression rose, It was because I saw all these things that I still see in you, That you're such a great guy and that you have so many great things going for you... (voice breaking) and that's why this is really hard for me... How so? Because, look, you are my perfect guy. In my head, you're my perfect guy, and I think I was looking to see if there was that romance there, and, you know, I've been looking for it and looking for it, and I just-- I'm not feeling that. You're just such a great guy, but I just don't know If I s s you as my husband. You don't want to see my-- meet my family and... (sighs) I just-- I-I'm just not feeling it. I'm just not, you know? Well... (sighs) You just don't feel it. I just, like, want to be honest with you, you know. I respect you so much That I don't want to put you through the rose ceremony. (exhales deeply) I want you to know that this is really hard. I was really looking forward to-- Whatever. It doesn't matter now. Okay. (chuckles) (sighs) Ohh. Wow. Ohh. Ohh. Ashley : when I was telling Ryan good-bye, Just the look in his eyes made me want To rethink my decision. You know how we were talking about how we needed that-- That, like, physical, like, passion? I just don't know if I feel that. (chuckles) All right. Ohh. He does really like me, and I think he's a really smart guy, but I think I'm looking at the end picture, and I don't think that I see him there. Bye, ry. Bye. That was a really hard good-bye, and I'm not 100% confident that I made the right decision. ? (sighs) Ryan : I'm shocked. I don't want to be alone. I want, uh, I want to share this life with someone. I want it. (sniffles) I felt like she was the one for me. I... I didn't'tee it coming. (voice breaking) I-I want s-- I want--I want someone more than you have any id-- Ohh. (sniffles) Oh, my god. You've gotta be kidding me. (inhales and exhales deeply) Jeez, man. (bleep) (bleep) (sighs) Ohh. (sighs) Ohh. ? Ohh. (inhales deeply) (exhales deeply) Um... (clears throat) (voice breaking) I-I want s-- I want--I want someone more than you have any... I want to find that person. (chuckles) Like, I wanna love someone... (sniffles) Unconditionally. ? I want real love. I want real, never-ending love That I could be myself with, and she can be everything that she wants and more. (sniffles) And... (sniffles) I want to find a partner That shares the same joy in life that I do... And wants to do great things and wants to be a great mother, and d want to be a great Dad... (voice cracks) and I will b bsomeday. Someday I will be. I will be. (sniffles) ? Coming up... (ames) there's only five of us, and whoever goes home tonight is gonna be heartbroken. Ashley : this has been more emotional Than I could've ever imagined. It's hard saying good-bye to people. (ames) we really don't know what to think. (crying)g)aybe I wasn't cut out for this, you know? And then... Not a day will go by That I don't regret how things have turned out. Emily speaks out. You know, you want something so bad and then it doesn't happen, and it's just... Heartbreaking. Ashley : this week has been so emotional. Honestly... (sighs) I think it was The right decision to say good-bye to Ryan. It was really hard in the moment, and right now I just know that I kinda just need To keep pushing through the dark cloud To get through to the clear. Tonight is gonna be really difficult. The rose ceremony means a lot. If you get a rose this week, It means that I want to meet your family, and it means that we're really taking a step forward In this relationship, so it's huge. I think this rose ceremony is the most critical rose ceremony. (ames) walking into tonight's cocktail party, There's only five of us, and this is a small group, and it's clear to us just how serious this is. Ryan went home early, which was startling. I mean, none of us was expecting that. Everybody, including Ryan, Thought Ryan was a top contender, and now he's been sent home, So we really don't know what to think. The mood here is shock and a little bit of fear. (man chuckles) Man : check this out. It's so huge. Jeez. Wow. (ames) each of us has such strong connections with ashley, Whoever goes home tonight is gonna be heartbroken. (exhales deeply) Ohh. And then there were five. No kidding. Hey, ash. Hey, Chris. You doing all right? I'm doing good. How are you? Good. Have a seat. Good. (whispers) all right. How's your week been here in taipei? Uh, this week was really good. I mean, I had some really great dates... Mm-hmm. But I do have to say that This week was the hardest good-bye. Yeah. Let's talk about Ryan. How did you go into that date? I mean, I try to go into each date living in the moment, but with every conversation, everything we talked about, I was thinking, ohh, I can't get his family involved If I'm really not feeling it. Yeah. He was talking about his business. You know, it's like, I don't want to keep him away from this If--if I'm really not feeling it. It's what these decisions have become now. I know. You're affecting these guys' lives. When I would give out roses before, It was, do I see something in this guy? Mm-hmm. Could we potentially have a relationship? Right. And now it's, can I see a future? Can I see wawang up with this guy? Can I see starting a life, a family with this guy? It's so different. Tonight how rough is this gonna be for you, Sending one guy home? Uh... To be honest, I know what I want to do tonight, and I don't think I need a cocktail party. With so much on the line, this is a big decision tonight. There's nothing that guy could say tonight? There's no look, there's no touch That would make you change your mind? Are you sure? I'm very sure about this. When did you make up your mind? After I sent Ryan home. I knew what I had to do. You know, sometimes I feel like When you're going through a hardrdime, You just have to push through it and just... Yeah. Get through it, and then there's, like, a clearing. I'm glad you have clarity. I'm glad you know what you want to do. Mm-hmm. It's a big week, so it's-- This is a good time to know what you're doing. Definitely. Okay. All right. Well, I'll go talk to the guys, and I'll see you at the rose ceremony. All right. Thanks, Chris. All right. This is the end of a big phase in our relationships with her. I'm worried. It's a weird-- it's a weird feeling tonight. I feel good, you know. I'm glad to see ashley tonight. I'm glad we're having a cocktail party. The guys that feel like they're on the fence, Including me, would-- I'd like to talk to her again, Um, if she's willing. Hey, guys. Hey, Chris. How are you doing this evening? (J.P.) good. You? I know I'm not exactly the person you were hoping Or expecting to see right now. I apologize for that, um, but I just talked to ashley, and she informed me, She knows exactly what she wants to do tonight. Her mind is made up, So there will be no cocktail party. E decided there's no reason to go through the motions, No reason to put any of you through that, So not only will there not be a cocktail party, It is time for the rose ceremony. One of you will be going home tonight. All right, guys, So in just a bit, if you would, come join me. All right. Thanks, guys. Men : thanks. The situation's pretty grave. (J.P.) I think it's just a continuation Of the date with Ryan. She knows what she wants. Yeah. She's just not wasting anyone's time. ? Ashley : I've made my decision, and I think it's the r rht decision. This has been more emotional than I could've ever imagined. Am dreading having to do another good-bye, but this is what I have to do if I want to get To where I want to be at at the end of this. I'm ready to get back to the United States. I'm ready to go home. I'm ready for a fresh week. I'm ready to meet these guys' families. Well, gentlemen, good evening. Men : good evening. I know it's been a great week here ininaiwan, but I also know tonight didn't exactly go As you all expected. You should know, having just talked to ashley, That just because her mind is made up and there was no cocktail party Doesn't mean this decision tonight wasn't a tough one. In fact, she knows just how important this rose ceremony is. The four gentlemen who leave here with roses tonight Get the opportunity to take her back to their hometowns To meet ththr family. J.P., you already have a rose. Nothing to worry about. As for the rest of you, three roses to hand out. One of you will be leaving here tonight, So I wish you all the best, and if you're ready, Here's ashley. (whispers) Chris. When you're ready. (sighs) hey, guys. Men : hey. This week we had a lot of great conversations, and I think that's really what gave me the insight Into this decision tonight. Uh, you know, up until now, Our relationships were based on just the relationship We had with each other, and it gets huge next week, Because we're involving other people, your families, So I took that into consideration When making this decision. I just want to thank you guys For traveling all over asia with me and being open to finding love. You know, looking back and seeing all the places that we've been, I'm so excited to say That I see my husband in this group, and that makes me really, really happy, but it also makes nights like these so difficult. Thank you for being a part of all of this, and you guys honestly mean the world to me, So thanks for that. ? Constantine. Constantine, will you accept this rose? All right. For you. (chuckles) absolutely. Thank you. (chuckles) ? Ben. Ben, will you accept this rose? I will. (whispers) good luck, buddy. (whispers) good luck to you. (exhales deeply) Ashley, gentlemen, It's the final rose tonight. When you're ready. ? Ames. Ames, will you accept this rose? (whispers) yes. Thanks. Mm-hmm. Lucas, I'm sorry. Take a moment. Say your good-byes. (constantine) all right. See ya, brother. (whispers indistinctly) (normal voice) sweetheart. I want to walk you out. Absolutely. Gentlemen. (grunts and whispers) thank you. (whispers) you're welcome. (chuckles) man. I gotta be honest. I did not expect that. Yeah. Yeah. You know, even though there wasn't Super-super romantic connection between us, I felt like-- like I've known you For a long time. You bet. Give me a hug, sweetie. Mm. All right, hon. Mm. Good luck to you, okay? No regrets. No regrets. All right, sweetie. Bye, Lucas. Take care. ? (Lucas) rejection's never r n. It was a shock. When my name wasn't called, Um, it was a gut shot. I was super close to bringinin ashley home to odessa to meet My mom and Dad and brother, and, uh... You know... I think I just built a slower connection Than--than some. I just want somebody to wake up to. I just want somebody To just cook breakfast in the morning together. Just simple stuff, you know, and, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna find that person. I wasn't ready for this to be over. I really wasn't. ? Ashley : saying good-bye to Lucas right now is so hard. He's such a great guy, and I hope I'm making the right decision. (voice breaking) ohh. I'm just, like... I don't know. (crying) Ohh. (sniffles) like, I never knew That there would be this much pressure. Ohh. (sniffles) Sometimes I just want to say, "oh, my gosh. Like, I can't even breathe." I--maybe I wasn't cut out for this, you know? (sniffles) (sighs and sniffles) Like, I hate feeling this way. I really hate it. I still think I'm making the right decisions, but it's like... I don't know. I just-- Ohh. I'm just, like... (sniffles) I think I'm ready to go home, you know? (sniffles) I'm ready to go to these guys' hometowns. ? Up next... This was my worst nightmare. What happened? Like, what went wrong? I wish I would've known. I felt like what we had was so real and, um... Sorry. I wanted it so bad. Nobody's more disappointed about it than I am. It's all coming up when the bachelorette" continues. Hi. I'm Chris harrison. In the many seasons Of the bachelor" and bachelorette," I have seen hundreds of men and women come on this show To find love, and I've seen many find their soul mates. Some have gotten married and even had kids. Their dream of a romantic life has come true, but not everybody is so lucky. Some of the couples that have gotten engaged on our show Have not stayed together, and they parted with broken hearts. So it is with a degree of regret and sadness That I bring you this bachelor" update. Brad and Emily-- It seemed like they were meant to be. All of America watchedas brm One of the most magical proposals We've ever had on this show, but the months after the show stopped airing Were really hard on them, and as much as they tried To keep their relationship private, it was not. And while they struggled, They were tracked by the tabloids and hounded by the paparazzi. Hurtful rumors continue to this day, and brad and Emily keeping their silence Throughout all of this Only seemed to make things worse,, So the time has come to speak out For the first time publicly, Try to help everybody understand How a couple so determined to make it work Finally gave up on the love they found together. Please welcome back Emily. ? Hi. (chuckles and sniffles) Thank you. (sniffles) hi. (door closes) hi. (chuckles) it's good to see you. Good to see you again. How ya been? (voice breaks) I'm doing well. Shaking a little bit? I'm a little nervous. I'm... All right. (laughs) Why are you nervous? (sniffles) I'm just scared. It's just sad being here. Oh. Is it? Mm-hmm. (sniffles) Last time I came it was... (voice breaking) it felt a lot different. (chuckles) Well, why don't we go inside and talk, okay? Okay. (sighs) (sniffles) Have a seat. Thank you. (sniffles) (sniffles) I'm sorry to see you again like thihi I know. Me, too. I thought we'd be planning a a dding next time I saw you. I know. (laughs) The last time I pulled up in a car Was the first night getting out, you know... Yeah. And, um, it just brought back a lot of memories, and, um... (voice breaks) yeah. (sniffles) So I can see you're emotional Being back here in the house. Mm-hmm. What is it about this place that brings that emotion out? Um... I think just being by myself and not having brad here and remembering, you know, how excited I'd get for dates... Right. And, you know, Um, the rose ceremonies and all that. (voice breaks) it's just sad. What was it about brad that drew you to him and drew you guys so close together While the show was on and then even after? During, you know, while the show was on, I think it was just-- he's such a gentleman.. You know, beyond his good looks and everything else, He's such a gentleman, and, um, he's very good at expressing how he feels and making whoever's around him feel good... Yeah. And he's just completely different Than any other guy I've ever met. And so, uh, just to be clear and so everybody knows... Mm-hmm. Where does your relationship with brad stand right now? Um, we're not engaged anymore. (voice breaking) um... (sighs) But he's... Sorry. It's okay. Um, but he's, you know, Ways gonna be a huge part of my life and, um... I don't-- You know, for so long, I think that we-- We left the dot, dot, dot," And, um, you know, I-I feel bad That it's taken us this long To, you know, let everybody know That, you know, I just finally, You know, I'm ready to say it. Are you still in love with brad? I'll--I'll... I'll always be in love with brad. You know, um... I-I'll-- No one will ever hear me say a bad word about him... Right. And nor will I tolerate Anybody else saying anything bad about him. You know, um, not a day will go by That I don't regret how things have turned out and wish things were different. So--and I know this is the million-dollar question... Mm-hmm. Because everybody wants to know, and I'm not saying everyone has a right to know, but... Mm-hmm. (sniffles) because this was so public, everybody does want to know-- "after the final rose" special When you guys started anew and--and I knew you guys to be going well... Mm-hmm. (sniffles) What happened? Like, what went wrong? (sighs) um, you know, Well, I guess I-- The--the day that brad proposed to me Was one of the happiest days I can remember. Yeah. And the show stopped airing, and I was gonna get ricki and I an apartment, and I was going through my house and cleaning everything out. I was so excited. Now when you said get an apartment, Were you gonna move to austin? Get an, uh, an apartment in austin for the summer and just, you know, kindndf see how things go, and I couldn't move in with him. You know, I-I have ricki, and I... Mm-hmm. I understand. I just wouldn't do that, um, but, you know, Little red flags would come up in our relationship, and I-I came to a point where I said, I have to be honest with myself and with this relationship, and I realized that maybe... My want for it to work out... Mm-hmm. I wanted to be married, and I wanted to have more children, and I wanted that with him-- Maybe e ershadowed the actual reality Ofofhe relationship. Okay. I-I didn't doubt that we loved each other. Mm. I just doubted, you know, um, If he was still gonna want to be with me, you know, and, um, you know, I think that We both have been used to being single. We're both used to being single, and, um... I think that that's a hard adjustment. You know, as a single mom, I don't have the luxury of saying... Right. "I'll just figure it out when I get there," you know? Yeah. Or well, everything ll go away When I get there," you know? Right. I-I need to know that the person that I'm moving for is gonna want to be with me Six weeks down the road, much less six years, and, um, I just-- I didn't have that reassurance, and maybe we didn't have what it takes To, you know, um, Last forever, 'cause when I get married, I want it to be forever. (voice breaking) I think that's what makes this so hard is just remembering that and, um... (sniffles) how things took such a turn, and I don't know how it happened. You know, I wish-- I-I wish I would've known... Mm. Or we--that we could've done something different, and, I promise, Nobody's more disappointed about it than I am. Um... (sniffles) but, you know... Yeah. I wanted to do that. I wanted to... I felt like it was a fairy tale going through it, and I feel like... (sniffles) everybody else did, too, So I don't want anybody to feel like they were lied to. (chuckles) This was my worst nightmare, you know? I've just always believed that-- Or thought that, As long as you love each other, That it'd work. Mm. (sniffles) mm. And I just--I swore that we would be the one that would, You know, because I felt like what we had was so real... (voice breaking) and, um... (sniffles) my hopes were so high... Yeah. And I wanted it so bad, and, um, it's just really disappointing, and it feels like a failure, and, um... You know, you want something so bad and then it doesn't happen, and it's just... Heartbreaking. Um... (sniffles) I just had such high expectations For everything. (chuckles) (inhales deeply) (chuckles) Well, I appreciate you being here. We have a lot more to discuss. Thank you. Um, is--this is the first time you've spoken out publicly About your breakup with brad, and so I'll continue my talk with Emily... Mm. When w wcome back right after this. Welcome back.Talking with emiy The first time she's spoken out... (sniffles) About, uh, her breakup with brad, and I--first of all, I want to discuss why brad isn't here today. Mm-hmm. Um, and you know this. I've talked to brad. Mm-hmm. He knows that you and I are sitting here... Mm-hmm. And, uh, he actually gave his blessing. Oh, yeah. You know, I wish I didn't have to sit here. I-- You know, you all invited me to come and do this... Mm-hmm. A while ago, and--but brad and I both said, "thanks, but, no, thanks." I just thought that it would go away after a while, and, you know, peopop would... Yeah. Move on to the next couple, but the--everybody deserves to know what happened, Because whenever you go on the show, You open your life up, and... Right. Um, you know, I-I want-- I want to-- I want to tell people, Um, but I just-- I want it to end with this. I just want to say it one time, you know? Any--anybody who's ever gone through a breakup knows That you don't want to tell the story... Right. 18 times. You know, it's hard to talk about once, and I just, you know, I trust you to, you know, Tell the story and not sell it. I know you guys have been... Attacked and haunted By the tabloids, by the paparazzi. Mm-hmm. Try to shed a little light on what your life has been like, What that's been like. Um, I think that anybody that comes on the show, um, Expects a little bit of that, but there's nothing that anybody can do To prepare you for this kind of attention. Going from, you know, being a nobody To being followed to the grocery store. So, uh, the paparazzi would sit outside your house? Oh, yeah. I mean, the cameramen would sit outside my house All day, all night, follow us everywhere. I couldn't go anywhere, and it's hard when it's-- so they would literally Follow you and ricki everywhere you went? Oh, yeah, and it's hard to explain... Yeahah To a 5-year-old, who doesn't know what the bachelor" is, Why anybody is taking pictures. You know, she would only buy that they were taking pictures At the bookstore of everybody... Right. For so long, and, um, You know, she thinks I'm, like, The least cool person ever. (chuckles) so, um, you know, I told her that everybody thought I was taylor swift, and she didn't believe me. (laughs) (laughs) It's been so difficult trying to live this In the public eye. Mm-hmm. Do you think brad and you would've made it Outside of all this? I don't know, Um, and I think that it would've been much easier. Much easier. When was the last time you talked to brad? Just a couple daysysgo. You know, we text a lot, and, um, we talk often. Do you think you'll remain in touch? Oh, yeah. He has, I feel like, Changed me as a person. You know... Mm-hmm. He has taught me a lot, and, um, I'll always, always be here for him, You know, um, always. He is incredibly protective of you, and so, it's, you know, I-I just see this Between you two... Yeah. And it, um, and I see what that does to you, uh, right now. Yeah. It makes me sad, 'cause I know that we love each other enough, You know, that we could make it work, Um, if it was just based on that, um... Right. But it--it's not, and, um, You know, it's just really sad. Yeah. So where do you go from here? Right now I just-- I don't know. Um, right now I just want to focus on being a mom and not have to worry about, you know, If somebody is in the bushes taking pictures Or if something I tell a girlfriend is gonna end up in a magazine the next day and not knowing who to trust. I think this--this-- All this attention brings out the worst in people, and, um, you know, It's been really hard on me. It's, you know, you don't know who to turn to, So you end up just staying by yourself, and that makes you even more sad. Yeah. (sniffling) Well, I very much appreciate you coming here... Thank you. And, uh, I'm sorry That you and I are sitting down talking like this. (chuckles) me, too. That is the last place... (chuckles) Me, too. I want to be sitting with you, and, um, I'm sorry brad wasn't here with us today. Me, too. I speak for everybody on the bachelor" Who ever came in contact with you, and I know, the millions of viewers, That, you know, we all wish you the very best. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next week on... (speaks indistinctly and laughs) Ohh. Ashley : this week is hometowns, and it could not have come at a better time. Oh, no! (laughs) And I can't wait to meet their families and see what they're really all about. Hello? Benjamin. (laughs) you're really in your element here. (constantine) I am. Ashley : this is awesome. Ashley : these guys are so great... Hey. Hi. How are you? And d eir families are so incredibly nice. Woman : whoo! (laughs) (rhythmic clapping) This has been one of the best experiences of my life. I think that Dad, you know, really is looking down on us, Because--and I think he would be proud of you. I know that I'm doing the right thing, and it's times like these where I'm really happy. I've probably only taken home four girls To meet my parents... -Hmm. And the last one didn't turn out so well. How are you so sure about us, and--and you haven't been so sure... Well-- Your whole life about girls? I'm very guarded Because I never want to see your heart broken The way it was broken before. (constantine) my thoughts need to be clearar I need to figure things out. Knowing you, I know you so well, and I don't want you to be rushed into anything. I just don't know if I'm gonna be ready In three weeks to propose to her. I don't know if that's possible for me. (constantine) I feel a have a deadline in my head that's-- That's really messing with me. It's all coming up next week on... All right. Man. That's a lot of walking. I know. Let's sit here. Yeah. Is that what you think about our love lantern? No, no, no. I think a lot about it. I just want it to dry out. (both chuckle) Ahh. You having fun today? I am. I'm having a good time. (gasps) hey, pup. (makes kissing sounds) Uh-oh. Oh! (gasps) (both laughing) Our love just got pissed on! Damn! I think that's a sign. Oh! It's so cold-blooded. Oh, my gosh. That is... (laughs) Ashley : I don't know if this love lantern is ever gonna get off the ground. (dog panting) I think we're doomed. That's okay. It'll dry.. I thcaptioned byomed.
