 Previously on... 
 Ali : Iceland was incredible. 
 (cheering) 
 It's just been so great being with all these guys. 
 I should be happy, but I'm not because Ali's over there. 
 Frank : There's never enough time. Group dates don't cut it. 
 Ali : I have other great guys here  that want to take the time to get to know me. 
 Frank : It's driving me insane. Like, I'm--I'm just-- I'm an emotional disaster. And Ali giving that rose to Ty shows me what I need to do to get the rose next time. Kasey : I'm Kasey Kahl. I'm a dreamer. I'm a believer. I think this is your time to shine. Send the wrestler back to the ring. Justin : It's gonna be a showdown at the O.K. Corral. Kasey : If I get sent home, that's gonna destroy me. I'm gonna give Justin the rose. Justin : There was actually two roses given-- One to Justin and one to "Rated-R." (laughs) And tonight... whoo! Frank : There's no more romantic way to fall in love than traveling around the world. Being in front of the Hollywood sign, a Broadway stage in New York, cave diving in Iceland, and now here we are in Turkey. Being here is surreal. Turkey, baby! Whoo! Ali : It's incredible. Ty : This place is phenomenal, but it's even more unbelievable that I actually have a date with Ali. I am falling in love with her. I feel like this could work, but, like, you still wonder how. Ali : I feel like things have been sort of up and down with Frank. What are you thinking? I think my relationship with you scares me. (Craig) I'm ready more than I've ever been for anything to fight for her heart. Ali : Oh! Kirk : Oh! Woman : One of the guys there has a girlfriend. It's unspeakable what you've done. I came here to find a husband, and you're (bleep) with that. No, no, no, no. Sit down and talk like a man. (bleep) Chill out. Ali : Are you seriously gonna walk away from me? You're gonna go out like this? This is how you want to be perceived? You're gonna regret this. Ali : I'm thrilled we are in Istanbul, Turkey, this week. It's incredible. I didn't realize that 13 million people live here. There's so much energy around me, and the city could not be more beautiful. The buildings and architecture is breathtaking. It's gonna be a good week, and I-I have really high hopes for moving forward with a lot of the guys this week. Up until now, I've been trying to figure out what guys weren't right for me. And now, I'm feeling really confident about these seven guys that I still have here. Gentlemen, good morning. Morning. Welcome to one of the oldest, most beautiful cities in the world--Istanbul, Turkey. Ali : They're interesting and smart and driven-- everything that I want. You'll be continuing your journey to find love with Ali in this historic city. Ali : So now it's really just about finding out who do I see as my husband and who do I see as my friend. I think I'm gonna get there in Turkey, and I'm really excited about it. We are gonna have such a good time here in Turkey, and I hope they're as excited as I am for what's to come. (Craig) Wow. Man : Yeah. Man : Whoo! I feel better right now than I think I have throughout this entire journey. And, uh, I don't think anything could go wrong at this point. (knock on door) Hi. (laughs) Welcome-- Welcome to Turkey. Oh, my god. Thank you. How you doing? Good. How are you? You got a second to talk? Yeah. I'm scared. Why are you here? Don't be scared. (chuckles) Ah. So something I do need to tell you, though... Okay. Um, something that, uh, was brought to our attention. Um... Oddly enough, a former cast member who you know--Jessie-- who you became friends with last season... Uh-huh. She contacted us... Mm-hmm. And, uh, gave me some information that... Is legit. I've checked it out-- A real story that I think you need to hear. So, uh, I want to give her a call real quick and let you, uh, talk to Jessie. Mm-hmm. All right? Oh, my gosh. So let me see. I'll grab the phone here. (keypad beeping) (clears throat) (beeping continues) Ali : my heart is racing. Yeah. (telephone rings) (speaks indistinctly) (ring) (ring) (ring) (rings, line clicks) (Jessie) hello? Jessie, hey. Chris Harrison. Hey. How are you? Good. Good. Hey, uh, do you have a second to, uh, talk to Ali? I do. All right. Thanks, Jessie. Thank you, Chris. It's Jessie. All right. Hi, Jessie. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. It's so good hear a familiar voice. I know. You must be going through Quite the adventure there. Oh, my gosh. Yes, it's been great. But I'm a little nervous. What's up? Listen, um, I have some information about somebody that is on the show That I don't think is there for the right reasons. In fact, I know that he's not there for the right reasons. One of the guys there has a girlfriend... Oh, my God. How do you know this? 'cause I'm sitting with his girlfriend right now. (gasps) are you serious? Yeah. Her name's Jessica. Thanks. Hello? Hi, Jessica. This is Ali. (sobs and sniffles) I don't even know where to start. Um, basically, me and Justin have been dating For the past-- almost two years now. And a couple months ago, he said, "you know what, Jess? "I'm going on the show, but it's solely for the purpose of getting my foot into the door Of the entertainment industry," And, you know, his wrestling career. (voice breaking) and he assured me that when he would come back, That we would be together and finally set our plans to get married. And I did--I believed him. (crying) What did he say his plan was? I don't even understand. He was gonna... (normal voice) um, basically he said to me, His is something that's gonna benefit the both of us, Because it's gonna open a lot of doors for me." And he said, "I really want to get into top three, "because once you're in top three, you're well-known." I helped him buy his suits. I helped him take his head shots. He broke his leg. I took him to the hospital. You know, I really didn't want to do this from the beginning. I didn't want to almost... (sniffles) Cause trouble and drama. (sighs and sniffles) And the fact that you could potentially choose him To be your husband and then what? (crying) he actually contacted me last night... And he said... (sniffles) He said that he still loved me, and that's when I kinda put my foot down, Because a couple days after he left, I found out that he had another girlfriend. For the past two months-- another girlfriend. (crying) Nobody--nobody should feel what I'm feeling right now. And this is really, really hard for me to talk about. (sniffles) You know what? I'm really trying to be strong through all this. Um, I'm... I don't know what else to say, Ali. I'm sorry. I hope you can stay strong, and thank you for giving me this, Because this is... The most important thing I'mev. I really, really, really do want to meet my husband here. Neither of us deserved this, and it sucks That someone would be here... Like that. Yeah. Bye. Sorry. (clears throat) Ali : I just can't believe it. Justin was acting the entire time he was here. Justin has painted this pretty picture Of how genuine he is and he'll climb mountains for me. I mean, everything he said was basically a lie. You know... (sighs) Like, from night one, the guys-- They voted him off in the ballot box. Remember? Yeah, that's right. That's right. And... I really just thought, like, maybe he's misunderstood. Yeah. And he was so sweet and so nice and hiked up to my house on his crutches. Like, you know, he seemed so perfect on paper and-- did all the right things, yeah. I think the thing that upsets me the most is just how much he just said how he wanted to find a wife and he's here for the right reasons. I mean, he said "I'm here for the right reasons" So many times, and he said that knowing That he was planning on leaving if he was in the top three. What... A jerk. I have given up everything to be here, and... To think that... I could have had someone here till the end? I'm just pissed... Yeah. You know? This is Jessica. That's a picture of the two of them. We found out he's contacted her, like, secretly, Snuck off, used phones. He's been calling her while he's on the show with you. Do the guys know? No. I just found out and came straight to tell you. I mean, honestly, the question is, what do you want to do? Um, it's up to you. I'm--I am beyond pissed. I... Okay. I want to get him out of here and as quickly as possible. Okay. Ali : it's disgusting, what Justin did. It just makes me sick to my stomach, and I'm not gonna let him get away with it. You ready? Mm-hmm. All right, I'll take you up to the guys' room. I'm gonna go downstairs and confront Justin. I want him on the first plane back to Canada. If he wants to come on here and embarrass himself, Then go ahead, but he's not gonna embarrass me. (door closes) You know what you're gonna say? I have an idea. Ali : unexpectedly, I just spoke With Justin's girlfriend Jessica. This is ridiculous. She told me that Justin's plan was to come on the show, Make it to the top three, then leave me and then go marry Jessica. Just be strong and let him have it. Oh, I will. I will. This has been my fear from the very beginning, and I feel like his deceitfulness is even worse. I'm just pissed. I believe in being good to people and putting people in their place When they're not good to you. Okay. You ready? Oh, my God. My heart is just, like, crazy. Take a deep breath. (inhales and exhales deeply) Okay. Okay, let's do this. Hey. Hi. I get a knock at the door and I open it, and I see Ali standing there with Chris Harrison. Where are the rest of the boys? Man : hey, fellas. Chris L. : yo, Ali's here. Kirk : oh, my gosh. Kirk : Ali walked into the room with Chris Harrison. That hasn't happened before, so I don't know what's going on. Ali : so, yeah, guys, It's been quite the road getting here so far. You know, Justin, I think it's been Especially difficult for you, 'cause... You probably really miss your girlfriend in Canada. (mouths word) She called me this morning. Really? Yeah. And she was really upset. (mouths word) you promised her that you were gonna come here and get to the top three, and then go home, Promote your wrestling career, have a life with her. You sat here and cried to me about your mother and respecting women, and you think this is the way to respect women? No, no, no, no. Sit down and talk like a man... No. First of all. No, because I'd rather just not say anything, and... I'm shaking right now, I'm so angry. Roberto : here. Sit down. (sighs) It's okay. He told me how he's so much about respecting women and... Justin : I don't have a girlfriend. All this stuff about his... I'm out. Chris Harrison : what are you gonna do, Just walk out without talking to her? (bleep) you, straight up. Chris Harrison : Justin. ...I got my passport. I got my wallet. That's all I need. Uh, I'm gonna go talk to him for a second, Just to see what he has to say. Ali--she was pissed at Justin, and there was fire in her eyes. (Craig) a lot of good people went home... Man : although... To have his ass stay. That dude is a (bleep). That (bleep) wasted everyone's time. It's horrible. Chris Harrison : he just left. He went down the stairs. Going down? Frank : this is Ali's journey to find love, and Justin--he is screwing With a very kind of sacred thing to her. He is nothing but a jerk. Kirk : if Justin had anything to deny, Justin would have sat here like a man and argued his case. Man : yeah. Justin dug his own grave on this one. Ty : he's out here. Shut up. Get one last look at that (bleep). Camera all in my face. If you wanna talk off camera, I'd be more than glad to talk to you. Don't touch me. Don't-- You want to talk off camera? J-Justin, you seriously are ? You're gonna go out like this? This is how you want to be perceived? Justin, talk like a man, first of all. (whistles) (bleep) Wow. Man : where? Man : there he is right there. Roberto : yeah, that's Justin. Ty : uh, his wrestling career might be over After Ali body slams him out there. Kirk : what is say-- gonna say to her? I want to know what he has to say for himself. Man : is he really running from her? Man : yeah. Chris L. : I look out the window and I see that the wrestler's, Like, jumping over things. Like, I mean, who does that? Ali : Justin, you're gonna regret this. Believe me, you'll want to talk it out. Kirk : Justin's wrestling character-- It shouldn't be rated-r." If you bust out a wrestling t-shirt, It should say "Justin--liar." Ali : Justin, you're gonna regret this. (Craig) there's Justin. Oh. Kirk : can't open it. ...Where? Right down here. Chris L. : where's Ali? Going in and calling out Justin-- I think Justin was shocked. I think the way he reacted to the situation says it all. He got up and walked away. What kind of man does that? Chris Harrison : he's coming back. Ali : hobbling over. Yeah. Here goes nothing. You know, when you're caught in a lie and not expecting it, You need a little time to gather your thoughts To come up with a story, and I thought that's what Justin needed--time to run away So he could come up with what he was gonna say to me. I know you probably want to rip my head off right now, but, um, basically, with me and Jessica, I never, you know... You know, yeah, I have, you know, strong feelings for her, but, like, honestly, she's like someone that I would say is like my best friend. And I--and I truly--I didn't-- I thought I was going in this with 100% of my heart, but as the process, and, you know, the weeks went by, My--my heart became less and less into this. You know, the weeks and weeks-- so when did you realize this... T-- the other day when I gave you a rose and sent Kasey home on a two-on-one date? I mean, I just think it's so unfortunate that... I am-- Someone who wanted to be here and was so ready To be here for me-- I-I wanted to, the day after, give you bacthe rose, and I even actually still have it in my pocket, ironically. Yeah. No, I don't want it back. I--well, to give it to somebody else, but-- Well, it's a little too late for that, Justin. Yeah, I know. Jessica told me you guys had been planning this from day one. She said that... Not at all. You came here and told her it was just to become famous and that you were gonna have a life with her, marry her. Not at all. Well, then you're telling me your best friend... Not at all. This girl that you supposedly care about, just lied to me? Mm-hmm. Threw you under the bus and lied about a man that she loves? You think she did that to you? Because the girl I talked to On the pne was bawling her eyes out. I felt so sorry for her. And she told me that you have Another girlfriend that she found out about. That's not true. Not at all. You know, I am-- you've been calling her... Hang on. Numerous, numerous times, though, right? Throughout this whole thing. No, absolutely not. N-n-no, period. Okay. Absolutely not. D--no. Is she lying? I have not-- is she lying? Is your--is this girl a liar? Tell me right now Jessica's a liar. But about, like... Tell-- I'm--I'm not gonna-- about what? Like about what? That you came he to get famous and that you guys were gonna be together and get married. No, I did not--no, look, I did not come here to get famous. Did you tell her you were gonna marry her? I did not--I don't know I-if that's-- I-if that's a poss-- like, honestly-- Justin, you know what? No, no, but this is the thing. Like, no, but this is... Oh, my God. The thing, though. It's not-- that's why it's not that simple. It is that simple. No, it isn't. You come here to find a wife. I came here to find a husband, and you're (bleep) with that. Absolutely not. 'cause I came here with-- And someone went home--someone went home the first night That could have been here for me. I gave up my job. I gave up my apartment. I gave up everything to be here. Mm-hmm. For you to do this, it's awful. 's unspeakable, what you've done... Okay. Not only to me, but to her. Okay, so on that note, I'm sorry For everything. I'm sorry for-- You could've just owned up like a man, Justin. Owned up like a man... Wait, hold up. I'm only-- hang on. And leave here with a little bit of honor... But-- And a little bit of integrit okay. Well, whatever you think. (Ali sighs deeply) Justin couldn't even defend himself. I said, "this is what Jessica just told me. Tell me she's a liar," and he couldn't. He wouldn't. And that speaks volumes. To me, he left like a coward. He hung his head, put his tail between his legs and walked out. I think Justin made it very clear That everything Jessica told me was true. I hate Justin for doing this to me. You know, this has been my fear from the very beginning, and the fact that he might have been calling This girlfriend of his all along, It just makes me sick to my stomach. Okay. ♪ (beep) (electronic female voice) next saved message. (beep) (electronic female voice) next saved message. (beep) (electronic female voice) next saved message.

I'm so glad that Turkey is Gobbling his way home to Canada right now. It's a long way from Turkey to Canada. I hope he has to swim with that broken leg. The first night--he got voted off first night. Justin should have been gone weeks ago. I mean, there's always been some drama with that guy. But, uh, drama's not why we're here, you know? I believed him. Unless I'm the most gullible-- Man : no, I believed him, too. That he is not-- I bought it. That's what I mean. That's what I'm saying. (knock on door) Kirk : oh, boy. Chris L. : date card? What are you waiting for? I'm gonna jump up, grab that card and read it. I want a date this week. I haven't had a one-on-one date yet. I don't want the group date this week.

You look cute. That's awesome. Are you ready? Absolutely. You show me the way. ♪ Ty : wow. (Ali laughs) Ali : Ty a I had the entire bathhouse To ourselves.

The Turkish bath is breathtaking. There's these little, sort of, stars and holes cut out In the ceiling of the dome that-- Light is pouring through them, and there's old fixtures where the water comes in, and it's crazy to think That people have been bathing here for 300 years, and I feel... Empowered being here. There's something very magical about this place. Wow. I know. I-I'm just, like, in awe right now Of this building. Oh, the building's just the half of it.

She might say, he would be an awesome friend-- You know, the kind of guy I'd want to hang out with but not the kind of guy I'd want to marry. I mean, that's-- (knock on door) Man : ohh! Man : we've got a date card, gentlemen. Frank : date card! Chris L. : craigger! What do you think, craigger? (man imitates parrot) Craig r. Uh... Chris L. : I'm thinking one-on-one. I still wanna be the guy that Ali chooses in the end, but I know that I have a lot of competition For Ali's heart, and that worries me, Because I still haven't had a one-on-one date with Ali. "love nquers ol(Ive)." Group or one-on-one? It's a group date. Kirk : whoa. Roberto : okay. Okay. Frank : if my name is not on that date card, That means I've got the next one-on-one date.

Chris L. : you're the first guy with two one-on-ones. That's unreal. I would've thought 100% That Craig would be on the one-on-one. It's--it freaks me out a little bit.

I mean, as far as there being something there and the chemistry between us, it's definitely there. ♪ That was nice.

I'm thinking, there's four of them. There's four of us. I don't like where this is going. This guy looks like he really wants to kill somebody. (Craig) looked like they meant business. I'm a little scared. Know somebody That would be a great bachelor or bachelorette? Go to bachelor.ABC.Com and click apply." Ali : oh, this is so cool. Ty : yeah. I love this neighborhood. (laughs) (laughs) oh. Ali : hanging out with Ty today Just confirmed what I already knew about him. You know, he's a good, genuine guy, and I'm looking forward to spending more time with him.

Ty : my feelings at this point Have gotten stronger and stronger for Ali, and there's a rose on this date, and I want it more than ever. I really do. It's been a learning experience for me In that when it's right, It's just something that you just know. Mm-hmm. And I like that you're spontaneous. I like that you're not scared to get your hands dirty. I like that you have-- You're ambitious and you're--you're driven, and that's-- and it comes out, and it's very, very-- it's very sexy, actually. It's very becoming. It really is. And I just want to know, Wh-what is it about me that you like? (laughs) flatter me. No, I'm kidding. Glad you asked. (laughs) (laughs) What do I not like, I feel like, is the question. I mean, you're very attractive... (laughs) And a big 6-foot whatever, like... (laughs) that's good. Okay. N-nice-looking guy. That helps, but that's not what's most important. To start off, I'm looking for a feeling... I agree. I agree. And I always feel good when I'm with you... Well, good. And I think that's all that matters. I-I mean, I want to know more about who you are and what makes you who you are, and that's the good and the bad and--and the hardship... Right. And I-I just have, like, some questions, but I don't want you to think I'm asking these questions 'cause I'm like, oh, he's been married before-- oh, and I want you-- Anything that you want to ask me, I want you to feel like you can ask me anything. Was there, like, an incident that happened one day, Was it just, like, building? It was more of a lot of things building up, and I expected one thing, and it really wasn't there. Mm-hmm. And... My family is very important to me... Mm-hmm. And that was probably the hardest part for me. Who offered the divorce papers? Like, who--who suggested-- that was me. You did? That was me. I grew up-- my mom stayed at home While the kids were at school, you ow, my Dad worked, and that's what I was accustomed to. But, uh, with that being said, You know, I think that was a lot-- did you have more traditional roles? I think it was--a lot of that was the problem. Did she work? Did she? Yeah. That was a lot of it. I guess I struggle with that sometimes, and it took me living a little bit and seeing what else was out there. Mm-hmm. Women are presidents of companies. They're c.E.O.S. I was so closed growing up, I didn't see those types of things... Mm-hmm. So, uh, I think after really realizing I don't live in a box, I changed as a person. Mm-hmm. I mean, I learned, it has to be all or nothing. You're either in it or you're not, So with that being said, I think I'm a better person. I think that I can be a better person For somebody else, and finding somebody that I am going to be 85, Shuffling my feet along the floor with... (laughs) Not being able to walk-- That's important, and I want that. I want to be with somebody that I enjoy. That is... That's gotta be part of it.

I'd love to get some one-on-one time with her To kind of give me some peace of mind That I'm gonna get a rose tonight, Because nothing's, uh, nothing's for sure, especially tonight. Ali : this week has been so insane. I was not expecting everything to happen with Justin The way it did. But now I have, you know, these six great guys and that makes it all the more difficult To send one home. You know, throughout all of this, There's definitely times that I question myself-- For instance, keeping Justin. But tonight, I know what I need to do, and I need to talk to Chris about it. Hey, Ali. Hi, ris. How you doing tonight? You look great. Oh, thank you. I heard you wanted to chat before the cocktail party. Yeah, I did. Have a seat. What's going on? Um, I don't really think I need a cocktail party tonight. Okay. And I think I know what I need to do tonight. So you're saying you wanna go straight to the rose ceremony? You wanna skip the cocktail party altogether? Mm-hmm. (sighs) I mean, I... Okay. I feel like I've had a connection of some sort... Mm-hmm. With every guy here but one. I keep anticipating her coming down these strs. Man : yeah. I'm looking for the shadow on the wall. I'm lookin'--me, too. (sniffs) Ali's--she's probably puttin' the final touches on. She's just kinda making us wait, sweat it out, Sweat it out a little bit. (exhales deeply) Ty : yeah. Frank : I'm not used to seeing you nervous, man. (Craig) I know. Neither am I. You know, it's definitely... (man speaks indistinctly) More on the line right now than... I agree. (clears throat) Kirk : I'm feeling a little less confident as this goes on. I could be on the chopping block. I don't know. I-I mean, I really could. I know she likes other guys here. She's spent a heck of a lot more time with Frank. And I, uh, can see when she looks at some of the other guys That there's definitely something there. So knowing that time's running out tonight, There's gonna be a lot more pressure to make sure I get everything across that I need to get across to her. ♪ Man : where is she? She would've been here by now. Ty : ah, somethin' went wrong. (whispers) man. So just so we're clear, your mind's made up. You know what you're gonna do tonight. You wanna go straight to rose ceremony. Yeah. I know what I ha to do. And I don't feel comfortable having the guys feel like They're making sort of one last plea or one last chance To show me that they should be here When I feel like I know what I need to do. I get that. It's prolonging the inevitable. Mm-hmm. Okay. I'm gonna go talk to the guys, Tell 'em about your decision. Mm-hmm. And, uh, when you're ready, Come join us, and we'll be ready for the rose ceremony. Okay. Thank you, Chris. Okay? All right? Thank you. Thank you. Ali : I feel, at this point, I've had a significant amount of one-on-one time with each guy To make my decision Of who I've really progressed with in a relationship and who I'm not quite getting there with yet. So I don't think it's fair to the guy that I wanna send home To put him through a cocktail party. Every step closer, the rose ceremonies get harder. But every hard decision that I make, I'm one step closer to finding my future husband. Men : oh. Roberto : my, my, my. Ty : hello. Hey, Chris. Ty : lookin' good. Guys. (Craig) how are ya? I see by the looks on your faces, I'm not exactly Who you wanted to see come down those stairs. (Craig) no. I know you were all excited To have a cocktail party th Ali tonight.

So, gentlemen, if you would, head up the stairs, Get ready for the rose ceremony. Kirk : are you serious? Are you being serious? Man : he's serious. Ty : oh, my God. Man : wow. Chris L. : we were all just in complete and utter shock. Like, you know, I can't believe this is actually happening. Chris H. : head on upstairs, fellas. Thanks. Man : really? Chris L. : I'm--I'm nervous. I could get sent home tonight and I won't see her again maybe ever. You know, who knows? Man : whew. Chris L. : wow. Kirk : the fact that Ali's already made up her mind, It makes me nervous. I'm scared to death because I'm vested in her, and she gives me something to lose. I want to stay. I want to have an opportunity to be with her, and right now, um, I know it's on the line. Roberto : I'm sure all of us are gonna be kind of Playing in our heads every moment we've spent with her, Every question we've asked her, every answer we've given her. Every look we've given her before the big, uh, big moment. ♪ Gentlemen, I know you were a bit surprised There was no cocktail party tonight. At the same time, I think you all appreciate the fact That Ali has made up her mind and she's ready to go. Frank, Ty, the two of you have already received roses. Nothing to worry about tonight. As for the four of you, there's three roses left. One of you will be leaving tonight. Wish you guys the best. And if you're ready, here's Ali. Hi. Hi. When you're ready. Thank you. (sighs) hi, guys. Hi. Hi. This week has been really emotional for me In the sense that I feel like All of my relationships have really taken a step forward. And because all of my relationships Are really moving forward, I didn't feel like it was fair to go through a cocktail party Knowing that my mind was already made up. So thank you, guys, so much for being here. ♪ Roberto. Hi. How you doing? Good. Will you accept this rose? Absolutely. ♪ Chris. You look beautiful, by the way. Thank you. Chris, will you accept this rose? Yes, I will. Ali, gentlemen, It's the final rose tonight. When you're ready. (mouths word) ♪ Kirk. (sighs, whispers indistinctly) will you accept this rose? Absolutely. (mouths word) Craig, I'm sorry. Take a moment, say your good-byes. (Ty speaks indistinctly) Frank : I'll miss you. (Craig) me, too. (whispers) bye. (exhales deeply) Can I walk you out? Please. (exhales deeply) (Ali sniffles) Okay. (sighs) I guess before you say anything to me, um... (sniffles) I want you to know Everything that I said to you the other night was true. Um, I meant it from the bottom of my heart. And, um, I don't know. I don't know if... I'm saying everything I want to right now, but, um, this has been... An incredible, incredible experience. I'll never forget any of it. (sighs) I-I-I just think that the romance or something Was missing between us. Mm-hmm. All right. Thank you again. Okay. (kisses) (sighs deeply) Good luck. Thank you. I'll see you. (whispers) okay. (Craig sniffles) (sighs deeply) Ali : Craig has a lot of really good qualities In things that I think a woman would be So happy to find in a husband. But there just wasn't that connection Between the two of us. ♪ (Craig sighs) Wow. (chuckles) (exhales deeply) That was really heartbreaking. I'm shocked. I wanted it to be mutual, and I thought that what-- what we had was... Heading in the right direction. I was falling in love. I was. I had strong feelings for her. Um... (whispers) oh, man. (sniffles) (normal voice) um... (clears throat) She's like no girl I've ever met before, and I wanted to be the one that ended up with her, and--and, um, you know, It--it hurts knowing that that's not gonna happen. It will take me some time to get over it. (sighs) (sighs) Ali : well, that was really hard. But again, it's just one step closer to why I'm here. We've come from L.A. To New York To Iceland and now here in Istanbul. I think it's about time we head back West, but we're not going back to the States quite yet. We are going to one of the most vibrant, sexy, Beautiful cities in the world-- Lisbon, Portugal. Oh, my God! Yes!(laughter) Frank : are you kidding?

Man : Holy crap! Ali : oh, my God! Look at the ocean! Kirk : Lisbon, Portugal, is probably The most beautiful city I've ever been in. Chris L. : some fairy tales you don't believe, and then they happen. Ali : people say that when you're in love, Everything is more beautiful. And being here, the sky is bluer. It's so wonderful. Frank : this is a dreacome true. This whole experience, I don't want it to end. (laughs) Ali : I only have five guys left, and this determines whose families I meet. Hello! Oh!

(Ali) I love animals, but I love them when they're alive. Roberto : I'm packing my bags and I'm thinking, Tahiti is gonna be unbelievably beautiful. Ali : I'm about to take the journey of a lifetime. I'm so ready for some sun and romance in Tahiti. Ty : I mean, I feel the connection that we have is deeper than most of the guys here. Roberto : in Tahiti, I expect the time with Ali to be more intimate and I'm excited. Frank : I've dreamed of coming to Tahiti for years and I should be happy. But I'm here to do something that's going to hurt. Ali : Frank and I have an amazing connection. I just can't wait to hug him and kiss him and tell him how much I missed him. I can say wholeheartedly that I'm falling in love with him. Even a place this beautiful can't be beautiful When I feel this bad. (crying) (heart beating) to come to this point, this point right now,  And do this is so unbelievably selfish. He knew how I was feeling. He knew how attached I was to him. (sighs) I can't help but think, like, there's something wrong with me. (cries) I don't know what to do. Kirk : I can't propose to a woman Who, no matter how I feel, doesn't feel 100% about me. Ali : at this point, I'm afraid that I have wasted my time. Ty : she made a mistake, and I hope she doesn't regret it.
