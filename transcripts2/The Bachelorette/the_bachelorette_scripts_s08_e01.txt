 Yes. 
 Let's see. Aah! 
 Aah! (Laughs) Mommy. 
 (Laughs) 
 Woman : My name is Emily. 
 Mommy, I don't need to be pushed. 
 Oh,  sorry. 
 I'm a single mom, and I cannot believe I'm the bachelorette. 
 That's wild. 
 How do you get so high? 
 I can't even begin to tell you how grateful I feel to be the bachelorette. 
 I think this swing is broken. 
 My ultimate goal in all of this is to meet somebody that I could marry and have children with and that could be that father figure in Ricki's life, which I want for her more than anything. 
 Uh-oh. (Chuckles) 
 Whoa. 
 Whoa. Look. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Chuckles) 
 My daughter is the most important thing in my life, and I wish more than anything that her Dad was still here, but that's not the case. 
 Get all the sugar bugs out, 'cause I think you ate a lot of chocolate today. 
 We got engaged in February of 2004, and then in October of 2004, he was in a plane accident. 
 You ready for bed? 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 The plane had crashed, and, uh, nobody had made it. 
 (Voice breaks) 
 It was the worst time in my whole life, and, um, I really wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. 
 You want to say what you're thankful for? 
 That Friday afterwards, I learned that I was pregnant with our daughter, and I could not have been happier. 
 I'm thankful for love. 
 Oh, that's very sweet. 
 (Giggles) 
 ♪ 
 You want some pancakes? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 She's, like, the sweetest little thing ever... 
 That is a lot of chocolate chips. 
 That  is  a lot of chocolate chips. (Laughs) 
 But I'm 26 years old, and you have to have a balance. 
 No potty talk. 
 (Children laugh) 
 More than anything, I want a family, and I want to be a wife, and I want a husband. 
 So you had a good day at school? 
 Yeah. 
 I just want that life. 
 I get really lonely. 
 I mean, Ricki goes to bed at, like, 7:30, and that's when it really sinks in that it's just me in this quiet, empty house, and that is when I get the most bummed out about it. 
 There's nothing else missing from my life other than having a husband just to love me. 
 Hi. 
 You look beautiful. Thank you. I mean, very b--I'm Brad. I'm Emily. Nice to meet you. It's so nice to meet you. It's so nice to meet you. Can I hug you? Do you mind? Yes. Okay. (Chuckles) (Chuckles) When I came on the bachelor," I was ready to move on and find love again. You really do make me feel totally special, and thank you for that. (Kisses) Brad showed me a lot of things that I didn't even know existed in guys. I want you to know that I am absolutely, completely falling in love with you. I fell really hard for him, and I was definitely in love. I had found my guy. Emily, please make me happier than I've ever been in my life and marry me. I would love that. I would love to. Without a doubt, I thought Brad was gonna be my husband. I want to spend my life with you. The day that Brad proposed to me was one of the best days of my life. Promise? I give you my absolute word. I felt like we were gonna be together forever. I love you, babe. I love you, too. Where does your relationship with Brad stand right now? Um, we're not engaged anymore. (Voice breaking) Um... (Sighs) But he's... Sorry. It's okay. Um, I just had such high expectations for everything. (Chuckles) When things didn't work out with Brad, I was obviously heartbroken, but being with Brad really taught me that I have it in me to fall in love again. He reminded me of that, and he helped me do that. I am 26. I've been engaged twice. Both times, I really thought that it was gonna work, and I thought it was forever. (Clicks) I can't go through this and fall in love and then have it not work again. (Whinnies) Coming back to be the bachelorette is a huge risk, but meeting the person that I'm supposed to spend the rest of my life with-- I think that's totally worth it. Hopefully, he's here. Good job. I think being engaged is something that's really special and something that should be saved for the person you're gonna marry, and so I really hope I fall in love and get married and this is it for me. (Speaks indistinctly) Like a lot of girls, I've had my heart broken, and it's hard to put yourself out there again, but you have to, and you gotta just... Put on your big-girl panties and move on with it. And tonight... Emily! Hey! Emily meets 25 of America's most eligible bachelors. The name's charming. Prince charming. (Whirring) There's a helicopter coming? It looks like-- whoever this is, we're all gonna hate him. Oh, come on, man. Man : What if it's Brad? And then... Men : Emily! The party gets started... Aah! I'm just joking. Oh! Shut up. I really felt that there was a spark there. (High-pitched voice) Me, too. The night just got so weird already. (Chuckles) And the romance begins. I would've walked here for you if I had to. Aw. As soon as we saw that rose, people got tense. Pressure's on. You mind if I steal her for a minute or two? What's going on, man? Well, I certainly mind. Man : I don't like him. I think he's fake. I see right through him. You can't let somebody else get some actual time with her? I don't understand why he's so hostile. It's all coming up tonight on the exciting season premiere of the bachelorette. Hi. I'm Chris Harrison, and welcome to an exciting new season of the bachelorette." Few women from our show have left such a lasting impression on viewers across America as Emily maynard. The Southern single mom with heartbreak in her past fell in love with bachelor Brad Womack, and when Emily and Brad got engaged, we all hoped she had finally found the love she so deserved, but sadly, Emily and Brad broke off their engagement last year, and Emily was left brokenhearted once again. Tonight starts an exciting new journey for Emily, and it all begins right here in her hometown of Charlotte, north Carolina, but this season of the bachelorette" will be very different than anything we've seen before because Emily's journey is not only about finding her soul mate. The man she chooses to become her husband must also be a caring father figure for her 6-year-old daughter Ricki. Emily lost her first true love in a tragic plane crash. Her second engagement to Brad ended in heartache. Now all of America is hoping the time has finally come for Emily to find true love again and complete her family. Emily's on her way here right now, but before we welcome her back, let's take a look at the 25 men who have come from all across the country to Charlotte, north Carolina, to win Emily's heart. (Whirring) I'm Kalon, and I'm from Houston, Texas. Kalon : I'm a young, fun, good-looking guy with a few dollars in my pocket. I can wine. I can dine. I am the modern Southern gentleman. I got a hot date I need, uh, I need a new suit for. I used to be extremely loud and obnoxious and a womanizer, but I just kinda hit this point in my life where I did some self-reflecting, and I made a deliberate and drastic change in my life to be a more kinda responsible, down-to-earth, uh, dependable person. I'm so excited to meet Emily. This is the first time I've really put myself out there in a vulnerable state, and she could be my wife. It could be the first day of the rest of my life. ♪ Man : I'm Ryan. I'm 31 years old. I'm from Augusta, Georgia. I played eight years of pro football, and now I own a, uh, sports training facility. Arm action. Good. Good. I work with kids. I'm a mentor. I work with pro athletes. I want to teach them to be able to do their very best, no matter what it is that they're called to do. I'm very excited about meeting Emily, because I think that she's special. The inner beauty that she has just pours out of her, and that's the type of woman that I would like to be with. (Train whistle blows) I'm Tony. I'm 30, and I'm from Beaverton, Oregon. Well, this is a great batch we got here. I buy and sell lumber and plywood. There's a passion in my life, and that's fitness, but the most important thing about me is that I'm a father. (Exhales deeply) Okay. Ready? My 5-year-old son Taylor is the best thing that's ever happened to me... Okay, Taylor, open your mouth and go, "ah." And the reason I smile so much and--and get up happy every day is him. Uh-oh. Mr. hand. When I was in college, I met what I thought was the love of my life and got married, but I found out that my wife had started seeing somebody else, and now I'm just a single Dad trying to find love, and I think that I could possibly find that in Emily. What has two thumbs and is gonna marry Emily? This guy. ♪ My name is Lerone. I'm 29, and I live in Los Angeles. Did you get the paperwork I sent you, the purchase contract? I do full-service real estate-- investments, mortgage, residential listings. I love real estate. You know, I'm in a great place now, but the one thing missing is a partner. I'm definitely a family man. I want a family right now, and I understand that a family is what I'd be taking on with Emily. I think the fact that Emily is a single mom is one of the most attractive things about her. It's proof that she's strong, independent, she's responsible, and that's exactly what I'm looking for. ♪ (Horn honks) I'm David. I'm 32. I live in New York City, and I'm a singer-songwriter. I don't want to, like, toot my own horn, but writing songs comes natural. It's like walking. It's a rush of emotions that are totally ineffable. I've got a lot of songs specifically about trying to find true love. ♪ Emily ♪ 
♪ Emily ♪ 
♪ Emily ♪ 
♪ oh, oh Emily is exactly the kind of woman I would want to be with. She's intelligent, well-spoken, well-postured, refined. She's the quintessence of, like, perfect, beautiful woman. We have all of these disparate facets that ultimately converge. There's going to be a chemistry there. ♪ Emily ♪ 
♪ I'm Charlie. I'm 32. I grew up, perfect family, went to college. Just pretty much lived just a normal life. About a year and a half ago, I was involved in an accident that could have cost me my life. I was over at a friend's house, and we were outside on his second-story balcony, and it broke, and I fell about 15 feet. I broke four ribs, punctured a lung, fractured my spine, and sustained a severe traumatic brain injury. Through my recovery process, I started really thinking about a lot of the things in--in life that I'd really never experienced. What do you think about a girl? (Growling) No? Yeah? I'd never really gave myself an opportunity to experience true love... You gonna miss me? And I'm ready to find love with Emily. I may have had a head injury, but there's nothing wrong with my heart. ♪ My name's Jef, and I live in salt lake city, Utah. Very rarely do people take me seriously, just because of the way I dress, the way I act. I like being underestimated because people, if they really care enough to get to know me, they're pleasantly surprised. It sounded like anything we wanted to do... (Man) Yeah. They were up for. Man : Yeah. I'm the CEO of a bottled water company, and every bottle that's purchased, we donate a portion of the profits into our charity, and that charity builds Wells all over the world for people who don't have access to clean drinking water. I'm very different from business owners that are--that are buckled down because I'm young, and I want to enjoy life, and I just want to find that special person to share the rest of my life with. I believe in the fairy tale ending. (Engine rumbling) I'm Arie from scottsdale, Arizona, and I'm a race car driver. (Engine roaring) I've been involved in indy cars for my whole life. I've raced in the Indianapolis 500. I represented the Netherlands, and I've traveled, and it's been just a passion of mine. I'd love to be married and find the right girl, and I'm excited for the chance to meet Emily. There's one thing I'm worried about. I know Emily's ex-fiance also raced, and he passed away on the way to a race. Being a race car driver could bring back some painful memories for Emily, so I'm definitely nervous going into this. I know that it's a big risk, but I'm willing to take that risk, and I hope she is, too.

Whatcha doin'? Nothin'. May I try some of this on? (Giggles) Yeah. You want some? Here. Look at me. Cheese. Let's see. There you go. (Chuckles) (Giggles) You're so pretty, though, you don't even need makeup. Close your eyes. (Laughs) (Kisses) Now you have it on. (Both laugh) Does my hair look okay? Yes. Okay. You look like a princess. (Giggles) Thank you. You want to go help me put my dress on? Yes. I'm excited for you to see it. It is so, so fancy. ♪ (Crickets chirping) The night we've all been waiting for is finally here. Emily is about to embark on the greatest adventure of her life. 25 of the most eligible bachelors in America have come here to Charlotte just to meet her, but before they arrive, let's welcome back America's newest sweetheart-- our bachelorette Emily. ♪ This is so crazy. (Chris chuckles) I am so nervous. It's good to see you again. You, too! You look-- welcome to Charlotte. Thank you. You look beautiful. Thank you. It's so good to see you. Can you believe we're here, we're doing this... No. In your backyard? No, I can't believe that I'm the bachelorette, much less in Charlotte, and it's so wild. I am so excited to meet the guys. Well, they're on their way here, so before they arrive, let's go in and chat, all right? Awesome. Come on. Thank you. Right through here. Have a seat. Thank you, sir. Wow. I know, right? How are you doing? I am so nervous. I can't even begin to tell you. I mean, how do you prepare for being  the  bachelorette? I mean, there's no way. Coming in here tonight, I'm thinking, this could be the night that I meet my husband. I, you know, I mean, that's really exciting, and I-- obviously, I-I want that more than anything. I want to back up a little bit, because you were--you were scared to do this... Mm-hmm. In the first place. Yeah. Why? Um... (Sighs) I was scared just because I've been through a lot, and, um... Mm-hmm. I've, um, been in love twice, and I've lost it twice. Right. I mean, it's scary to put yourself back out there again, and I fell in love hard, um, with Brad. I really, genuinely thought that it was--that was it, that I didn't have to date anymore. Right. So much has been made of your past. Mm-hmm. You have such, um, such a tragic story. I mean, you talk about the first love of your life, Ricky... Mm-hmm. And--and him dying, you know, tragically... Mm-hmm. In the plane crash. I mean, it's understandable why you have those fears. Yeah, I think that, um, you know, losing Ricky, uh... Put a fear inside of my soul that I don't know if I'll ever be able to shake. Right. To be honest, I don't want to talk about that anymore. Yeah. Um, I've really moved on from that. Um, it's always gonna be a huge part of my everyday life. You know, we have a daughter together, and she's always gonna be a reminder of what I don't have... Yeah. But, um, I'm finally at a point now where it's a good reminder. You know, I see things that she does... Yeah. That reminds me of her Dad, and it--it-- and it's cool. It's okay. Yeah, it's awesome. Let's--let's talk about how different all of this is going to be. I mean, for the first time ever... Mm-hmm. We're in the bachelor or bachelorette's hometown. Mm-hmm. We've never had a single mom, and I know one of your hesitations in--in doing this, becoming the bachelorette... Mm-hmm. Was being away from Ricki... Absolutely. Being away from your daughter. Well, I mean, "the bachelorette" is-- it's a huge deal... Yeah. But I'm very protective over her, and I want to protect her throughout this-- this experience... Mm-hmm. I think that being in Charlotte is gonna help a lot. I love being able to wake up and make breakfast and, you know, all--do all the everyday mom stuff. And as we move five years down the road, you find the right guy, what's that picture look like? A minivan full of babies. (Laughs) (Laughs) I want it so bad. Mm-hmm. I want to be in love. I want babies. I want... (Laughs) I-I'm tired of being engaged. I want to get married. Can I give you a hint? What? Let's not open with that speech to the guys. I know. I thought I'd wait till, like, third date. "Guys, I want babies." Yes. Like, yesterday. (Chuckling) "Yesterday." The clock's tickin'. But more importantly, I want somebody-- I want the perfect person to share that experience with. I'm extremely happy you're here. Thank you. I'm excited to be a part of your future, 'cause it does start tonight. Mm-hmm. You have 25 incredible guys, all walks of life-- biology teacher, mushroom farmer, CEO, football player, single dads.

You know, telling myself that this isn't a competition... Man : Yeah. But when I want something, I'm gonna do everything in--in my power to make sure that I get that... Yeah. And feelings may get hurt down the road. You know, it's gonna be tough. I don't know, man. We're gonna have some competition. I'm sure we will. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Sure. Tall guys, skinny guys, short guys. Man : All right. I think-- I'm sure there's gonna be some great guys... Yeah. But there might be some that are a little out there, too. Man : Yee! Man : Wow.

(Laughs) (Paper rustling) (Sniffles) Ahem. I'm impressed. Yeah, I took some notes so I could remember... (Chuckles) Exactly  what I wanted to say to you. (Chuckles) Ohh. That's so sweet. So... just so that you remember... (Chuckles) Everything that I was feeling. So sweet. Um, I look forward to--to being around you some more. Thank you so much. All right. See you in a little bit. All righty. You better hold up that sign. I will. I'm gonna go in there and show the other fellas. (Laughs) (Helicopter whirring) What's going on? There's a helicopter coming? Oh, come on, man. (Man speaks indistinctly) Seriously, dude, if somebody comes out from that, like, as the last dude, like, it's over. No way. This is insane. Man : Honestly, who could this be? What if it's Brad? Man : No (Bleep). Man : What if he comes out? I mean... You know, it's like... Yeah, whoever this is, we're all gonna hate him. ♪ Kalon : Hi, Emily. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Well, thank you for being here. I'm Kalon. Golly. That was impressive. Well, good. Can we go inside? Absolutely. Perfect. Your dress is gorgeous. Thank you so much. Gorgeous. I don't know who that is. It's just some random dude. Well, that was very impressive. You definitely like to stand out, no? Well, I, uh, gotta do what I can to keep up with you. You're absolutely gorgeous. (Laughs) Well, thank you. I'm very glad you're here. I'm sorry if I made you wait a few minutes for me, but... It's totally cool. I promise, it's worth it. Thank you so much. I'll look for you inside. Perfect. Thank you. Sounds good. So nice to meet you. See you in a little bit. Bye. (Chuckles) Is that really our competition, man? All right. Congrats. He's got a chopper. (Sighs) (Man laughs and speaks indistinctly) Chopper style! What's going on, guys? Man : What's up? How ya doin'? Sorry I'm a little late. (Man speaks indistinctly) I'm Kalon. Nice to meet you guys. Hey, man. I saw you from above. It looked like you were having a little party. Man : Right. Where's the bar? She looks better in person. I mean, she is beautiful. She's-- she's gorgeous, huh? Wow. I definitely think, hands down, we're some lucky gentlemen, that's for sure. Man : Absolutely. Man : Yeah. Emily, 25 incredible men from all across the country are now here just to meet you. What do you think? I am so excited. I don't know what I did to deserve all these great guys, but I feel like the luckiest girl in the world. Before you go, I want to remind you, there will be a first impression rose to hand out tonight. Mm-hmm. The guy you give it to will be guaranteed to stay through the next rose ceremony. Do you know what you might want to do with it? I don't. I feel like, I remember how nervous I was... Right. Being in their position, so who knows? Maybe the most nervous guy in the room will get it. I don't know. With that said... (Chuckles) Relax. Yeah. Enjoy the night. Emily, the house is yours. Great. Thank you. Good luck. (Doug) Coming into this, we all knew she was stunning... (Men) Yeah. Yeah. Sure. But then walking up, I've never been that tongue-tied. Man : I don't think anybody got it exactly right. (Man chuckles) Yeah, right? Men : Wow. Hey! Hey. Ohh. Ohh. Hey. Wow. (Chuckles) (Speaks indistinctly) Aw. Thank you so much. How are you? Man : Hi, Emily. Golly, I'm nervous. (Men chuckle) Are you? Don't be. We're all shaking in our boots, too. Emily : Well, good. Yeah. First of all, I want to say, welcome to Charlotte. Man : Whoo! Man : Thank you. (Claps hands) Um, I mean, y'all have truly just blown me away. Some of you have actually blown me away with the helicopter entrance. (Men laugh) Thank you for that, but I just want you all to know how grateful I am that each of you are here. I remember not that long ago, I was in the exact same position and so nervous and didn't know what to say, what to do. I also know, more than anything, that it really can work. You just have to be open to it, and, God knows, I am a hopeless romantic... (Men laugh) So thank you. Man : Thank  you,  Emily. Man : Whoo! Whoo! So cheers! (Chuckles) Man : Cheers. John : Emily looks stunning. One, two, three. Emily! She, by far, hands down, is the hottest bachelorette. All of us got out of that limo... All... (Chuckles) And we're like, "I wish I could do that again." Yeah. "I wish I could do that over." I mean, I do not remember a thing. Emily : I thought-- (chuckles) No, you guys were all so great. And I don't even know if I introduced myself. I came out and I was like, "uh..." (Laughs) I-I'm having the best time getting to know all these guys, and they're all so interesting. (Speaks indistinctly) This is titanium. Like, it got reconstructed and rebuilt. Wow. Really? It's okay. Yeah. Aah! Oh! Shut up. I'm just joking. (Laughs) You scared me to death. I'm just joking. It's not. It's--it's real. Emily : I think it's very cute that the guys are putting so much pressure on themselves to make a great first impression. I have six kids, actually... Wow. And I even brought pictures. Would you like to see 'em? Yeah. Definitely. I'll share 'em with you, and you'll get to see my s-- um, pictures? Oh. I brought pics. It's a lot of fun having guys pull you one way and the other. Hey, beautiful. I hope you don't mind if I interrupt. Hey. It's awesome. This is not anything like my normal life. How are you? May I get a few minutes? Sure. When I go to the grocery store, guys are not pulling me in 15 different sections of the grocery store. Hottest mom in the world. To the hottest mom in the world. Yee! Yeah! She's absolutely gorgeous. Hello. Like, uh, when you watch cartoons, and the jaw just drops to the ground and it's, like, dragging across the ground--that was me. So I wanted to give you a little something that I thought, you know, kinda shows who I am. Okay. And you have no idea what I'm about to pull out of my pocket. (Chuckles) I don't. I'm a little nervous. So... (Laughs) Oh. This is actually a bobblehead of myself. I can tell. (Laughs) Looks pretty good, huh? It kinda looks like you. Yeah. That's so awesome. Can I keep it? Oh, it's yours. And... Really? I got one of you as well. (Whispers) Ohh. (Laughs) (Normal voice) No, you did not. And I'll tell you something, you know, they've been through a lot already together. Oh, my gosh. I think it looks good. Oh, my gosh. That's so funny. So are you ready? We're gonna-- oh, my gosh. We're gonna do a little scene. I'm used to playing Barbies, so this is like... Okay, so perfect, so we're gonna be all right with this. I-I got this. Emily, when I first saw you... Mm-hmm. Coming outside the limo tonight... Mm-hmm. I really felt that there was a spark there... (High-pitched voice) Me, too. And I hope that something really good comes out of it. Me, too. You know... Emily : Chris is super hot and so thoughtful. I like him a lot. (Makes kissing sound) I thought we were, like, pretty normal. (Chuckles) It's pretty weird already. (Laughs) That looks like a dinosaur egg. It's an ostrich egg. Really? Don't drop it. No, I'm just joking. (All laugh) The egg, you know, it's a joke between the guys... So is that what we're having for breakfast? It is. Perfect. But it's just kinda who I am, you know? It's goofy. It's quirky. It's different. You know, it's a little bit better than coming in on helicopter and being ritzy. I hope she's not really impressed by, you know, material things that are just, like, whatever. Well, I don't think she is, though. Just-- well, I-I mean, I think she wants to connect with somebody. Yeah. Well, and she, like, what she went through before and how bad that must've, like, hurt... I hope these guys are really good guys, because I think if anybody has been through a rough time, I think it's Emily, as--as far as love goes. Her fiance Ricky died in a plane crash, and so I think she deserves the best. Let me help you. Thank you. How's it going? Good. How are you doing? I'm doing all right. (Chuckles) Yeah? Yeah. You're a hot item at this party. Well, thank you. (Chuckles) You're welcome. I set this spot up just for us... Oh, well, I'm very grateful. And I thought... Thank you. I'd get us some champagne. Thank you so much. You're welcome. So how are things? Good. Yeah? I've been looking for you. I haven't seen you out there. I know. I've been getting to know all the guys and hearing a lot about you. Yeah? Uh-oh. All good things. Emily : Jef makes me feel kind of like a nerd. I don't know. He just had, like, a cool vibe. Uh, well, I was really impressed with the skateboard and... The skateboard? (Chuckles) Oh, my gosh. That was so dumb. No. I loved it. (Chuckles) I was hoping you were gonna save it, and I could ride it. I want--yeah. (Chuckles) I--we can go find it. I'm not the most athletic girl in the world. (Chuckles) That's cool. I know that's really surprising. (Chuckles) No, that's way surprising. It looks like you're really athletic. I know. I know. Yeah, and you look amazing. Thank you. Yeah. I really like jef, and he made a great first impression. I am so happy I got to talk to you. I'm so--I'm so excited. He is super cool, and, um, I hope that he thinks I'm cool, too. How are ya? Good. How are you? You having--you doing okay? I'm good. I am. (Doug) I'm a single Dad from Seattle, and I feel like Emily and I would have common ground in that, you know, we're both single parents, and it could be--it could be a really good fit. So this is a long night for you. It's gonna be a long night for you, too, dear. Where's Ricki tonight? I mean, like-- she is home. She has a babysitter. Oh, that's-- and your son's in Seattle and... Right. Yeah, he--I-- he lives--I have custody. He lives with me, uh... Oh, wow. And he actually wrote you a note, and--and I... Aw. Ohh. My goodness. Yeah, he-- (Gasps) Can I read it now? Yeah. Yeah. Please do. Yeah? Okay. So sweet. My baby. I-- oh, my goodness. Okay. I'm gonna read it, okay? "Emily, hi. My name is Austin, and I'm almost 12 years old, and I live in Seattle with my Dad. I've heard a lot of really nice things about you. I think you should know that my Dad is one of the greatest dads ever, because he always tucks me in at night." (Sighs) (Chuckles and speaks indistinctly) Oh, my goodness. I want to cry. "I'm proud of what he does, and he is always giving me hugs. Also, he is really funny." (Chuckles) Are you? I'm gonna expect a joke at the end of the night. Y-- yeah. Of course. Done. (Laughs) "My favorite thing in the world is spending time with my Dad." So cute. Oh, my gosh. "Hope you have a really good time. Austin." Oh, my goodness. That's my baby. Ohh. I mean, this makes me want to cry. Oh. I am so, so glad I got this. Thank you. It really means a lot. You're welcome. Emily : The fact that Doug's a single parent makes me feel like he gets kinda what I'm going through, and I certainly get what he's going through, so I really hope I get the chance to meet Austin. His little letter was so sweet, and just from that, I can tell that Doug has really done a good job at being a Dad. So how are you guys feeling? Man : That's really not that young. Good. Yeah. Really good. Fellas, Emily, hello. Whoa. Hey. Hey. Don't mean to interrupt, but, uh, the first impression rose. No hurry, but when you're ready, you know what to do. All right. As you were. See ya in a bit. All right, Chris. Yeah. Hey there. (Alejandro) As soon as we saw that rose, people got tense. Pressure's on. We're both waiting for, uh, a chance here. Yeah. What time is it? I mean, if I don't get time tonight, I mean, it's probably I'm going home, so the clock is absolutely ticking. Do you think that--that grandma thing... I-- I think--no, I don't-- in the beginning was-- I don't think the grandma thing's enough. Was good enough? No. I'd have to get some definite alone time. Yeah. (Man) Yeah. Yeah? Did you talk to her? Not yet. Really? It's driving me crazy. Alone time with Emily is extremely important. It's... It's everything, so I-I'm kinda freaking out. I need to get some one-on-one time (Bleep). ♪ That's, uh... That is the first impression rose. This is the fun part. Who's getting it? We're all, deep down inside, killing to get that first impression rose. (Chuckles) (Alejandro) This is it, guys. Like, we get one chance, and that's it. Of course I want the--the first impression rose. I mean, my mom always taught me, first impression is-- is everything, and, fortunately, I show up in a helicopter. (Chuckles) If you come in on a helicopter and you  don't  get the first impression rose... I don't like him. Oh, man. I think he's-- I think he's fake. I see right through him. I've done sales all my life. I-I can just totally read that he's trying to, you know, win something. He's not really in it for her. I just don't like him. I thought I heard my name. (Laughs) (Chuckles) Oh, you're helicopter guy," by the way. Some of the guys are a little bit hostile towards me, but at the same time, um, I'm kinda used to that. Uh, obviously, I'm here for Emily. Uh, I-I gotta explain myself a little bit. I would love that. I know, uh, I know I made a little bit of an entrance, but at the same time, I mean, I hope you realize that, I mean, I would've walked here for you if I had to. Ohh. Well, that's very sweet, and that means a lot. Do you think of yourself as, like, a-a hopeless romantic or-- oh. Oh, I-I used to joke that I was always the, uh, hopeless romantic, and--and the hopeless continues, because I still haven't found the--the right one. Yeah? Helicopter guy is talking. I'm certainly a mama's boy. Oh, that's sweet. Um, raised by my mom, a single mom, um, so I can certainly... Wow. Appreciate, obviously, what you're doing, and my hat is--is off to you... That's very cool. Because we had such an amazing bond, and I really appreciate her for being such a strong character. Well, I'm so glad you're here. Yeah. Do you mind if I can steal her for a minute or two? What's going on, man? Well, I certainly mind, but I-I don't know... (Chuckles) If I have any--any way to object. (Laughs) Well, I'd--I would appreciate it. Well, thank you so much... Of course, Emily. And I'm so, so glad you're here. It's so nice to meet you. Thank you. Oh. Uh-oh. Treat her well. She deserves it. She-- I will. She's a princess... Thank you. And she looks like it. (Chuckles) I'll see you later. So how are you feeling? (Sighs) I'm feeling good. Helicopter guy--he was basically out there talking to her, and then, uh, Sean came in, and, uh, he asked if he could get some time with her, and the guy's just like, "no." He asked if he--if he'd mind, like, in a nice manner... Yeah. And he's like, "oh, yeah. I'd definitely mind." (Laughs) Like, seriously. There he is right now. Man : Aah. (Chuckles) (Kalon) Are you guys talking about me again? Absolutely. Why aren't you talking about Emily? Why are you talking about me? You--you can't--can't let somebody else get some actual time with her? What do you mean? He asked you-- he asked you nicely. He's like, hey, do you mind if he gets some time? Oh, yeah. He did. And you just... "I-I do mind." And--and I-- "absolutely." I said so. I mean, I said, "of course I mind. Who wouldn't mind?" Uh, I-I mean, I'm here for her. Really? Should I--should I have just handed her over? Why not? Yeah. You had enough time-- time with her. Because I'm here for--I'm-- yeah. Absolutely. Everyone-- I'm here for her. Man : Intense. Uh-oh. (Chuckles) Let everybody. (Speaks indistinctly) Well, I don't understand why he's so hostile. You know, you all will g--you all will get a chance with her. Ooh. Are you warm enough? Do you want my coat? Oh, no. It's, uh... Are you sure? I'm from the mountains, honey. I'm--I'm good. (Laughs) (Chuckles) I just wanted to come and steal some time with you. Thank you. Emily looks amazing, and I think there could be a connection there, but I really think there's some important things that we need to talk about. Emily's ex-fiance was also a race car driver, and he passed away on the way to a race, and I know that obviously still weighs heavily on her heart, so I don't know how she'll take me being a race car driver. So I wanted to-- I'm--I'm a little nervous about one thing, I'm going to admit. Tell me. Like, so my background... Mm-hmm. Is in racing. Oh. So I didn't know if you knew that about me, but, uh, I've raced cars since I was 14 years old. Like, are you okay with that? Um... Yeah, I am. Totally. I love racing. I love being at the racetrack. Yeah. I have so many good memories there, and it's a part of, you know, who I am. It's really the only sport I know about that I can--I can-- that's so cool. I know like the back of my hand. Yeah. I can tell you about racing. I can tell you about cars. Yeah. That's, like, a huge, like, relief. I thought it was really thoughtful of Arie to let me know, um, about the whole race car thing. I think maybe people would think that I'd be kinda scared off by that, but it's been a big part of my life, and... he'd be hot in a race car. Hey. How ya doin', Emily? Hey, guys. And she's back. Are you having fun? We are. A great time. Yes. Good. Always. Well, I'll be right back. (Chuckles) All right. I'll see you guys in a little bit. Oh, where are you going with that? (Chuckles) I feel like I have a really good group of guys, but I know exactly who I want to give the first impression rose to, and it's somebody that made me feel like I deserved to be here and gave me those butterflies in my stomach. Hi. Man : Hello. Hey, beautiful. Guys, y'all having fun? Yes. I will be back in a little bit. Just passing through, huh? I'll be back. Man : It's like winning the super bowl, whoever gets the first impression rose. Man : Hey. Emily, welcome. Man : Yeah. Here we are. Hello. Have a seat, dear. Can I st-steal you for a second? Yeah. Yeah. (Speaks indistinctly) Oh, Dougie boy is getting the rose. (Speaks indistinctly) So are you having fun? You know, yeah, I am. Man : I'm glad he got it. I am, too. I'm not. All right. Well, it's been a long night, and I just wanted you to know, first of all, your son's letter was so, so, so sweet and so thoughtful, you know, and it's cool to have somebody else here that kinda gets, you know, what I'm going through. You know, missing your other half is... Yeah. Heartbreaking, so you have made me feel really comfortable and, um, so good about myself, so I was wondering if you would accept the first impression rose. Yes, I will. Thank you. Awesome. It looks so good on you. (Chuckles) Thank you so much. Thank you. Stevie : You know, now it's real. Somebody else got the rose, and, you know, we all obviously wanted it, but I'm just glad helicopter guy didn't get it. Kalon : Of course I wanted it. The first impression rose is great, but I'm certainly confident that I'll still get  a  rose, which, at the end of the day, is all that really matters to me. I think I'm-- you know, I actually deserved the first impression rose, so... it is--it's upsetting. You know, we got the rose ceremony tonight, and I'm nervous. I'm not gonna lie. Are your nerves gone? I mean-- yeah, I mean, I-I-- (clinks) Fellas, what's up? Hey. Hey. Good to see ya. How's it going? Chris! Wow. Look at you. I know, right? (Chuckles) Man : Yes. It is time for the rose ceremony, so if you would, come join me. Mnh. Emily : Coming into tonight, I was worried, like, I'm not gonna like any of these guys, and now I'm worried, like, well, hell, who am I gonna send home? Sean : I came here to see if Emily is gonna be potentially my wife. Obviously, I need to get the rose to--to move on to that next step, so I desperately want a rose. I just hope she saw enough in me to keep me around, because I think we have so much in common, but if I went home tonight, that would be devastating. ♪ Chris : Welcome to your first rose ceremony. It's been quite a first night. That's because we have quite a bachelorette. I can already see she's made a big impression on all of you. Doug, you got the first impression rose. Nothing to worry about tonight. Congratulations. Thank you. As for the rest of you, if you do not receive a rose, you'll be going home immediately. I wish you all the best, and if you're ready, here's Emily. When you're ready. Thank you. Well, I wanted to start off by saying, coming into this, I was really scared. I was scared that maybe you guys weren't gonna be into  me,  or I wouldn't have the feelings that I hoped I would have, especially in the first night, and you all have exceeded my expectations a million times over. It made me really hopeful, and I'm really confident that it can really work out this time, so thank you, guys, again. ♪ Chris. (Speaks indistinctly) Chris, would you accept this rose? Absolutely. Great. Ryan. Excuse me, fellas. (Chuckles) Ryan, would you please accept this rose? Yes, ma'am, I will. Awesome. Kalon. (Whispers) Excuse me, guys. (Lowered voice) Hi, Emily. Hello.
