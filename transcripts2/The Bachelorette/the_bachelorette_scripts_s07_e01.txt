 (laughs) quite an entrance. 
 America watched as ashley fell head over heels For brad womack. 
 You are by far the best-looking dentist I've ever seen. Oh. (laughs) Ashley : from the very beginning, Brad and I had that instant spark. Aah! (laughs) This is the best date I've ever been on. I'm not even joking. Score. It was definitely magical. Ashley, will you accept this rose, please? Of course, brad. I felt something so strong, and I knew that it was going somewhere great. I'm so happy. I didn't think that I would actually fall in love, and I surprised myself. I should've been really happy, but I never really let myself believe it. What's up? Retraction. Retraction, reluctance, second-guessing. My feelings for brad put me in an area Where I could've been hurt. You and I really do have something very real... I know. I know, right? (voice breaks) and I'm so scared that We're gonna lose something that could be really cool. I know. I know. I just told myself, no way. This can't be. There's no way he feels strongly for me. What if I can truthfully tell you that not a single bit Of the feelings I have for you have worn away? See, sometimes, like, I have a really hard time telling, and that's what worries me. I spent so much time in my own head, Fighting everything that brad told me, That I wasn't able to live in the moment. (brad) ash, can I talk to you for a second, please? Mm-hmm. I think, in the end, it probably was the main factor In brad and I's breakup. I'm sitting here, and I'm completely shocked That a relationship that I felt so strongly about Has gone in such a different direction. Me, too. I'm just--I'm kicking myself in the butt, Because I feel like... We could've had something so good, If I, like, would've gone into this, like, Knowing how to do it better. I mean, I can't turn back time. I can't change things, but I hope you'll just make The best decision for me and for you. Yeah. I, uh, I need to-- I need to tell you good-bye. (ashley, crying) I did not think that This would've ever happened. (sighs) (sniffles) Saying good-bye to somebody for the last time is hard, but I'm trying to find the strength To, um, just look for the good in the situation and move forward, but I can't see that far ahead right now. I guess I'm not that strong, you know. (cries) ♪ Ashley : when I left south africa, I was devastated. How strongly I felt for brad. I loved him, and I ver told him. Watching our relationship Go up and down and up and down was hard, and I have so many regrets. I wonder how difrent things could've been. That is gonna haunt me forever. I don't want to be that person again. I realize I can't go back. I can't change the way I handled the situation, but what I can do is pull out Everything that I've learned from it and move forward and pefully not make The same mistakes again. (chuckles) As scary as it is to put yourself out there and to really lay your heart on the line, It's a better feeling than regret, 'cause at this point, Regret is the worst feeling that I've ever had. You know, I was going through a hard time, but I wanted to start feeling like myself again, and within a few weeks, I did. Hi, scott. How are you? Nice to see you. Hi. How are you doing? I jumped right back into school, started treating patients, Just getting back to my old routine. Hey, guys. What's up? The timing is really great for me right now. I've achieved a lot of things that I wanted to achieve, and I'm at a point in my life where--all these things I've created for myself--I want to share it with somebody. I never thought that I would be given another chance, but here I am. It feels good. I'm gonna do it right this time. (laughs) Ashley : I cannot believe that I'm the bachelorette. I'm so grateful that I've been given this opportunity To make things right for myself. I don't want to regret,  And I want to be the best that I can be. (laughs) This life is so short, and I'm so happy with who I've become, and I feel so confident. I'm in such a good place in my life right now. I got knocked down in the first round, but I'm not down for the count, and I'm ready to get back in the ring. ♪ (seagulls cry, bicycle bell dings) Ashley : I'm back in l.A., and I feel great. (laughs) Ashley : I'm so ready to find love again. I'm ready to jt put my heart on the line. I have nothing holding me back. Being given this opportunity to date 25 different men and hopefully leave here with a husband-- I feel like the luckiest person in the world. This feels like a fairy tale. I cannot believe That I'm here right now, and I'm so grateful for this. I'm ready for it to start. It's exciting and a little nerve-racking, but I'm ready to start this journey. I have a lot of confidence, but there's a small part of me that worries. My biggest fear is falling in love with somebody and them not reciprocating that and being a disappointment to the guys. 25 guys are gonna show up, but I'm not guaranteed that 25 guys are gonna stick around. Whether I look like a fool or not at the end, we'll see, but I am just gonna lay it all out on the line, and I'm not gonna let my insecurities get in the way Of my happiness this time. My future is wide open, and so is my heart. I'm leaving here with no regrets. And tonight... Hey. 25 of america's most eligible bachelors... (laughs) are here to meet ashley... Whoa! (laughs) And it's a party like you've never seen before. Oh, my gosh! (laughs) Whoa. Look at this guy. Who the (bleep) wears a mask? If you're wearing a mask, You're obviously trying to hide something, I would assume. Yeah, I got nothing to hide. Man : the insanity begins. Oh! What?! Okay. I love your energy. I was so happy it was you. Really? Ashley : I feel like the luckiest girl in the world. What if we call my mom? No! Man : you have 25 guys out here. You gotta stand out. Something's gonna happen tonight. Man : has tim been boozin'? Yeah. He's pretty drunk. (snoring) Hey, tim. Tim? Tim? All right. (chuckles) I'm gonna have to get some help here, I think. And then... Ashley : I came here to meet the man of my dreams, (ashley, high-pitched voice) oh, my god! Man : this is a girl who I could see myself marrying. Whoo! Man : this is amazing. Ashley : that's beautil. Ashley : I'm living a fairy tale. I don't know how I got so lucky. (laughs) Man : she makes me feel alive. I'm so happy right now. Whoo! Man : there's no place on earth I'd rather be right now. Ashley : I can say, I am really falling in love with him. Man : there's no question that ashley doesn't have The checklist that I'm looking for in a future wife. I can tell you right now, it's not gonna work. I couldn't give a (bleep) about her. I think I would feel differently if the bachelorette was Emily. (heartbeat thumping) (ashley sniffles) (voice breaking) my heart is, like, totally broken. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. (sobs) Now how can I do this? Hi. I'm Chris harrison. Welcome to an exciting new season Of the bachelorette." We've seen enough relationships to know that Real love is a fragile thing. It can often quickly fall apart, Leaving heartbreak and haunting regret. That was definitely the case last season with ashley hebert. After a magical first date with brad womack, Ashley thought she'd found the one, but in the end, their love was not to be. Ashley blamed herself. She was heartbroken, filled with self-doubt. Why had she not trusted her feelings more? Why had she never told brad How much she really felt for him? Well, ashley's had several months To reflect on her mistakes, and now regret has given way to the promise of new romance. She's back and readyto fal, and she'll get that chance as our new bachelorette. Ashley's on her way here right now, but before she arrives, let's look at some of the 25 men Who have traveled from all across america to meet her. Man : I'm Ryan. I'm 31 years old.

Ten years ago, started in the solar industry With three other friends, and now we have Over 600 employees. I couldn't imagine doing Something I didn't believe in. You really want to make a difference, You have to love what you do. I would say, the only thing not perfectly sunny in my life is that I'm missing that special person. If I meet the perfect person, there's no doubt in my mind That I am completely ready to get married and build a life With that person. I am looking For the most powerful thing in the entire universe. The only thing stronger than the sun is love. I'm looking for the light my life To light up my soul brighter than the sun. Man : I'm J.P. I'm 34. I live in new york city. I work in construction management and real estate development. Ultimately, I'm on the right path To achieve what I want to achieve. We are getting into the ground June 1.

We were together for about seven years. She was the true love of my life. She had this history of-- of seizures. One day she went and got in the bathtub. I checked on her, and I found her... Facedown in the tub. I pulled her out, and I called 9-1-1. It hurt more than anything I've ever felt in my life To lose her. That part of my heart-- The trusting part and the loving part-- It just vanished. It died. Over the past couple of years since losing sarah, it's-- I've had a hard time putting myself out there, Taking that step. You know, I have so many things That I'm proud of and happy about in my life. I just really want someone to share that with, and so for me this is a great opportunity To sort of put my faith back in--in love and kinda take that leap. ♪ Man : my name is william.

No, but I'm so happy that I am. You look bk at your prior experience on this show. Mm-hmm. What do you regret the most? All this te that bra. Mm-hmm. There's not a lot of time... Right. And I spent it just complaining and being insecure and that I really feel like I made a lot of mistakes. I misused our time together, and then at the end, Brad and I got to a point where we had to be at a certain point In our relationship, and we weren't there. Yeah. My actions ultimately caused the demise of our relationship. What were you so afraid of? First of all, I'm the most skeptical person That you could probably ever meet, so coming on To meet brad, I didn't think I'd feel as strongly. I absolutely fell in love with him, and here brad is, telling me he really cares about me... Right. And now that I watch it, I believe him. In that moment, I didn't believe him. I just didn't want to look like a fool. I was scared to believe him, but I'm learning more so That I looked like a fool for trying not to be a fool, and now that I know that, I would go back and do things A lot differently. That's why I'm here. Maybe there-- how do we not do it this time? Being able to recognize it is the first step for me. There's no way I would ever do that again. I mean, life-- That's what life is all about... Right. Constantly growing and learning from your mistakes and recognizing your mistakes, admitting your mistakes, and I'm gonna continually be growing throughout the process. I'm not perfect. Yeah. I'm flawed, but I'm ready for my turn now. So you're ready to move on. You're over brad. Are you ready to fall in love, and can you find love? I hope I can find love here. I obviously can't predict the future, but I learned a lot from my mistakes, and I'm at a great place in my life Where I want to share it with somebody. Yeah. So if there is a great guy-- which I'm sure there are-- And sparks fly and fireworks go off... (chuckles) I think it's gonna be a very happy ending. What scares you the most about tonight then? Uh, rejection? That's the main thing. (clicks tongue) not rejection. I'm scared that some of the guys watched last season... Yeah. And coming into it, they're like, "eh, it's ashley." You just hope they like you when they get out of the limo? Yeah. I just hope I don't let them down, and then the other thing is, I'm very concerned that Some of the guys might not be coming on for the right reasons, and I know that's cliché, to say the right reasons"... Right. But I think--I'm scared that they aren't coming on here For me or the possibility of falling in love. Um, I spoke to a past contestant, Somebody that I was close to in the house... Okay. And they made me aware that somebody that was coming On the show was here for... Not a good intention. Wait. He had--did not have good intentions coming on here. Back up. How--like-- mm-hmm. So someone called you from last-- mm-hmm, and said, "ashley, I just-- "I just want to let you know, if, you know, if it--if I were In your shoes, I would want to know this, and--" how does she know he's even on the show? She's friends with his ex-wife. His name is bentley, and-- His name's what? Bentley. Okay. Apparently he's coming on the show to promote his job, but it just bums me out... This-- Because this is so important to me right now. But this is-- this is a little crazy. Never in the ten years I've done this show... -Hmm. Have we ever had drama... I know! (laughs) just my luck! Before the limo arrives! Just my luck, Chris. But the truth is, you know, People talk, and, you know, everything he-- It might not be true... Right. And I want to give this guy the benefit ofhe doubt. That's... Can you give this guy the benefit of the doubt? Well, this is--this is-- I mean, the moment he gets out and says, "hi. My name is bentley," I mean, you're gonna be sizing this guy up. Yeah, but you have to give people a chance,  So I'm gonna give him a fair chance. I'm gonna pretend like I haven't even heard anything,  But I hope that he's not... So attractive. (laughs) (laughs) you hope it's an easy decision? I hope it's an easy dec-- I hope he has only one front tooth. (laughs) (laughs) Worst case is what? I mean, you fall in love with this guy, and he's not here for the right reasons? I'm gonna put it all out there, Even if I feel insecure in a situation-- "well, what if this guy doesn't like me back?" right. I am putting it all out there, because I do not want to leave With the regret that I felt when I left brad. What if that leads to you being hurt? Then so be it. I'm not a fool.

Come on, dude. Guitar, huh? All right. Guitar in the building. Coming into this, I had no idea how amazing these guys would be, and I am so surprised with the caliber of men That are here, and I cannot believe That there's one that plays the guitar. I've always wanted to be serenaded. Okay. (exhales deeply) So what you got? Nervous? (grunts) Oh! What the... I don't really play guitar. That's awesome! I just--I just really wanted to talk to you.

Man : yeah. You gotta--you gotta take, uh, whatever chance you get. The insanity begins. (laughs) it's crazy. There are a lot of guys pulling some pretty cool tricks, and that sets the bar pretty high. You got 25 guys out here. You gotta stand out. Hey, batman! (rob) then you got the guy with the mask... Men : batman! Where's robin? Does he have a cape, too, or no? I think I'll probably avoid that guy Throughout the evening. Who the (bleep) wears a (bleep) mask? Man : have you guys ever seen the movie eyes wide shut," Though? Like, it's--it's kinda like that s*x party mask Or something like that. (jeff) this is exactly what I knew would happen. You cover up half of your face and--and all of a sudden, you're strange. We live in a society that everybody judges everybody From the outside. What counts is on the inside, and that's why I did it. You got something on your face. I want to take care of it. Yeah, I know. I know. I gotta leave it on. So where are you from? I'm from the land that I don't wear, uh... Is this for real? Yeah. Why is that? That does bother me. Uh... Yeah, I mean, move somewhere else. Man : you want to get in a conversation somhere else, Get out of this guy's face? Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll move somewhere else. Okay, bye. (tim) oh, this guy's a character over here. You know, it's funny, 'cause I knew you-- I knew you'd probably judge, but, you know, whatever. (jon) he can't take it. Yo, I don't walk around looking (bleep) robin. Uh, oh. Let's stay away from that right there. Can somebody take the maskoff? The guy in the mask is a weirdo. I don't like him. I'm here to hopefully find love. Who wants to be around a kid with a mask? I don't. I think he's a creeper. Like, I'm not kidding, like, that's (bleep) creepy. Does it bother you? It doesn't bother me. I just don't want you nowheres near me. Tim and the masked man are definitely nemesis. Yeah. Tim from new york was giving him (bleep) for it. He put a pillow right in front... Man : he's a little more loose than everybody else. Of the masked guy's face. It was pretty blunt. Something's gonna happen tonight. Something's gonna happen tonight. It's already started. (man, singsongy) drama! It's already started. Man : yeah. Man : wow. I'm worried. Man : hey, where's she at? It's a lot of pressure. So have any of you guys gone? You don't want to be the person who didn't get The time to talk to her and end up going home. Yeah. Well, then yeah, and if you're-- Ashley! We're waiting for you! (man chuckles) (tim) I'm nervous. Ashley is drop-dead gorgeous, and I'm not the best-looking guy here, so, like, I think It's very important to have time alone with ashley. Without it, I would get lost in the shuffle. Hey, guys. What's going on? Man : oh! Chris! Good to see ya. Ashley. Chris! First impression rose we talked about earlier. You know what to do with it. I'll leave you to it. Mm-hmm. Next time I see you, it'll be time for the rose ceremony. You guys enjoy. Thanks, Chris. Is this rose just gonna hang out here and taunt us all evening? I really think--I think-- (jon) Chris harrison brought out that first impression rose, and it was intense. Everyone's kind of wondering now, you know, Where we're gonna go from here, who's gonna get that rose. I'm obviously hoping that I get it. I'm a marine corps vet... That's great. And now I'm really ready to explore the world With a teammate in life, and, you know, someone... That's exciting. I can spend, you know, my life with, and that's why I'm here. Having the first impression rose out-- It kind of forces people to kinda get in the action. I'm gonna get my time. There's no doubt about that. Everyone's trying to impress you. I'm having a b-- you don't have to impress anybody. Everyone's kind of trying to impress me, yeah, which is-- I have no idea why. (lucas) the competition's tough. I mean, it's a crazy night. I'm a texas boy, and I'm so glad it's you, you know. Okay. Thank you. You'd better stand out. You know, with 25 guys here, You've really gotta either bring it or go home. You're such a kisser, I'll tell you that. I had to do something memorable. The first impression rose-- I would love to get it, but the competition's pretty stiff. It's gonna be a tough journey to try and catch her eye and remain someone that she wants to continue to talk to. I'm just trying to say--I'm just trying to say, I-I mean... You know what you can do then. (laughs) Guys, look behind you. (laughs) (chuckles) oh, jeez. (laughs) Man : oh, my god. He is good. (laughs) (chules) wow. Oh, man. Wow. Too much.

He's like, "this is gonna be a good chance. "you can prove that you're a good wife. I'm gonna puke All over you, and we'll see if you can clean it up." (slurred voice) I had a few cocktails. Aw. I feel bad. Are you gonna be okay? I'm fine. Not good. All right, tim. Sit back. Relax. Dnk your water, okay? I'll see you later. Tim is definitely drunk, and I feel bad for the guy. I can identify with wasted opportunities, and I think he's gonna wake up tomorrow With a lot of regret, and for me, for one, I know I want to leave here without regret, I feel bad. How's it going, man? You feeling better? (slurred voice) how's it going? Honestly, I'm wrecked. Was--has tim been boozin'? Yeah. He's pretty drunk. He looks dazed and confused.

I honestly don't know what it is as to why anyone drinks As much as they do and feels that it's appropriate. Man : hey. Just take a load off. We got--we got more time, you know. Plenty of time. Take a load off for, like, an hour and just chill. I definitely have learned from others' mistakes In my life, especially my Dad. I mean, I learned from his mistakes with alcoholism, and it's just something I've always been cautious about. Man : what's up, jeff? This is-- what's up, guys? Man : what's up? Hey. Man : hey, man. Man : how's it going? What's up, dude? (man laughs) (slurred voice) who's this (bleep) joker? (man laughs) Man : you don't like the mask, huh? If you don't think it's weird, then god bless ya.

Like, all kidding aside, You're making yourself look like a (bleep). (laughs) I get that that's your opinion. Yeah. No, like, seriously. Tim had a little too much to drink, and it was, uh, fairly uncomfortable. I'm a mature adult, and of course with my poise, I'm not intimidated. Tim should leave, 100%. Getting drunk is fun... Right. But not for this. Not r her. If you came here to mess around, you need to look for love Somewhere else. Maybe he just couldn't handle the pressure. If you can't take the heat, get out of the oven. Man : I was nervous, but I think the fact that it was-- Man : I was a little bit amazed to see tim just toasted, and, uh, he seems to be, uh, a hazard. It absolutely was disrespectful, you know? It's wasting everybody's time, you know. Be a grown man. Be in charge of yourself. (snoring) Man : ashley! (snoring continues) (chuckles) oh! Oh. (laughs) Tim? Tim? Tim? Tim? Hey, tim.

Hey, can I steal a couple of you guys to help me with something? Yes. Yes. Ashley : I feel terrible for tim. He seemed really nervous and I know how much pressure is on these guys tonight, but at this point, I think His behavior is not acceptable, and I think I have No other choice but to let him go home. Sleeping it off. Focus, focus. Bud, you need to get up. You want to sit up a little bit? Help. Oh, hey. Yep, we're up. Tim? Tim, ash is here. She wants to say hi. Man : he's up and at 'em. Hey, tim.

I'll get this. I don't know tim well enough to say whether or not he's-- This is something that happens to him often Or if this is a onetime thing, but enough is enough, you know? I hope you get home safe. Let's get you in here. Man : and have a good journey. You're a sweetheart. This is really important to me. I'm here again for a reason. I'm looking to find my husband, So I just want to be really clear very early on That this is really serious for me. (organ playing) Eff) tim's been sent home, and it just proved a point. He was, uh, Clearly re to party, and I'm not here to party my ass off. You know, I'm here for the right reasons, and I think ashley will definitely understand that. All right, jeff. I want to hear everything that's going on. Oh, my god. First off, you look amazing. Thank you so much. So do you... (laughs) Oh, my god. Well, I know. From what I can see.

Well, I mean, why blend in? So actually let's just take my face out of the equation, and it's all about just being different and kinda learning what's inside firs.. Yeah. Because none of this really matters on the outside, so... I love the idea behind it. Yeah. So do you think I'll ever be able to see? Will you ever reveal yourself completely? Absolutely. This is just for now, you know. For now. Please understand that, uh, to do this, Clearly you've gotta have confidence. Yeah. Definitely. You have to be willing to take some heat. I mean, it takes-- uh, big-time. Ashley : at first I thoughjeff's mask was just A cheesy gimmick, but now I'm realizing that It's not just a stunt to get my attention. I love the reasoning behind it-- you know, getting to know The real him, as opposed to what he looks like on the outde. Well, I'm glad you're here. Yeah, I'm--I am. And I hope you feel comfortable enough eventually To take it off. Yeah. Absolutely. Everything inside of me is telling me that he's sincere, and that's what I'm looking for in a guy.

(chuckles) How are you guys doing? Good? Nice. Good. Man : good. I'd say with Ryan getting the first impression rose, He's got a little bit of a target on his back now, and it kind of puts him in that place to be the front-runner, but he's gonna have a run for his money.
