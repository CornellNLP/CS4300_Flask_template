 Previously on.... 
 You're leaving? 
 Yeah. 
 (crying) I'm just so sad right now. 
 (bentley) I'm definitely done on the ashley front. 
 I don't know if this is gonna work for me now. 
 (bentley) things could've turned out differently If the bachelorette was Emily. 
 I pictured the end, and, like, I pictured you there, you know. 
 Even if I'm not coming back, like... 
 I still want to keep the dot, dot, dot" there. 
 (whispers) dot, dot, dot. 
 But a dot's better than just a period. 
 (ashley sobbing) why? Why? Why this? 
 I didn't think this would happen to me. 
 My heart is, like, totally broken. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I don't know what to do! 
 (sobs) 
 Now how can I do this? 
 And tonight... 
 (elephant trumpets) 
 Ashley : whoa! 
 Ashley : chiang mai is The perfect place to fall in love. 
 I was in a really dark place, but now I know in my heart That I want to share my life with somebody. 
 Ahh. This is perfect. 
 Man : this is, far and away, The most incredible place I've ever seen. 
 Ashley : if things continue the way they're going right now, I think that this could be a very happy ending for me. 
 Oh! (gasps) 
 (crowd shouting) 
 (siren wailing) 
 (heart beating) Ashley : I can't believe this. I did not anticipate this date going this way. It actually blew up right in my face. Man : immediately you could tell that ashley was just not right. What's going on in that head? Ashley : I wanna end the date right now. At--at this point, some people still have you on their minds. Some--some people don't. I don't have enough of a gut feeling right now To stand up and say I'm ready to marry that girl. Ashley : after everything that happened today, I can't help but to compare the guys to what I felt for bentley. I'm still trying to figure out what I feel for everybody. Ashley : I can't stop thinking about him. You're type is bentley. I can see it in your eyes. It's all coming up on... ? Of course, we leave... The sun comes out. But where we're going, it's gonna be nice and sunny, hot. Good times ahead. Man : we're going north. We're heading north to thailand. Man : chiang mai. Man : chiang mai. Men : ahh! The excitement hasn't even begun to wear off. In fact, I don't think it's gonna wear off. I mean, we're flying all over the world for love, Following ashley. Only hope to keep my fingers crossed That, uh, I'll be on a date with her this week. Man : thailand. Man : chiang mai. Chiang mai. (exhales deeply) Chiang mai. Temples, monks, ashley. Ashley. Ashley. (ames) chiang mai is really the perfect place To fall in love with ashley. It's famous for having thousands of monks in saffron robes Wandering around, Ancient temples-- literally over a millennia old-- And it's famous for being romantic. I think there's no city in thailand I would rather go on a date in. ? (ames) I'm completely blown away. Unreal. (ben c.) this is unbelievable. (Lucas) chiang mai. Seriously. If you can't build a connection in a place like this, You probably... Yeah. Right. It's probably not there. Probably not there. Man : oh, my god. Man : holy... Man : are you kidding? Man : very nice. Man : wow. Fellas, good morning. Come on over. (nick) it was kind of a-a rough week For ashley last week. Now we've gone to a new location. I'm hoping she has wiped that slate clean. Here in chiang mai, I guess my expectations will be To just kind of take our relationship to the next level. Well, gentlemen, welcome to One of the most beautiful places in all of thailand-- The ancient city of chiang mai. Check this place out. It is spectacular. This is where you're gonna be staying-- The mandarin oriental dhara dhevi hotel, One of the most beautiful resorts in all the world. Go find your private villa. Get settled in. As for the dates, I'll come talk to you in just a bit. But right now... Enjoy. Let's go, boys. Yeah! Man : looks beautiful. (Lucas) this is absolutely incredible. I'm so happy about being in chiang mai. I'm happy about seeing ashley. Hopefully, she sees something in me Let's check it out. This whole thing? This whole thing? What?! Wow. Yeah! (constantine) you've gotta be kidding me. Man : look at this. Man : wow. (J.P.) ashley and I have had our best moments When it was just the two of us. And this place is just prime for romance. It's peaceful and beautiful and exotic. You have got to be kidding me. (J.P.) if you can't find romance in this kind of environment, You're hopeless. (chuckles) ? Ashley : I'm so excited to be here in chiang mai Because one of the things I said coming to thailand, It was my new beginning. After everything that happened with bentley leaving, I was in a really dark place, but now it's different. Things are starting to change, especially this week. I'm really feeling like things are looking Really hopeful and promising for me. I'm just excited to see the guys. You know, we're in a new place. Kind of like a new beginning for us. A new week of dates. Chiang mai is the perfect place to fall in love. And if things continue the way they're going right now, I think that this could be a very happy ending for me. Hey, guys. Man : hey. Come on over, men. First of all, congratulations. 11 of you left. But remember, only one of you will have The opportunity to become ashley's husband. So with that said, let's talk about this week. Three dates. Roses up for grabs on all the dates. There will be a one-on-one date, a group date, and a two-on-one date. Ooh. All right, I see by the reaction most of you know What a two-on-one date means. Two men will go out on a date with ashley-- One man will receive a rose, The other will be leaving forever. So the two men that get that date-- Need to have your bags packed before you go Because one of you will be on a plane Back to the United States that night. I think you all get the gravity of that situation. All right, with that said, have a great week. Enjoy the dates. I have your first date card right here. Fellas, enjoy chiang mai. All right? I will see  Most of you at the next rose ceremony. Good luck. Man : thank you, Chris. Ryan : who has not-- who has not opened one? I-I think I will, uh, I'll take it. I haven't had a one-on-one date yet. It's like, come on. The first impression was there. Don't you want to go on a date with me? I've waited long enough. I've been patient. I have. It's time. (clears throat) "ben f..." Whoo! "let's fall in love in chiang mai. Love, ashley." All right, boys. I knew my time was coming. I'm really looking forward To having ashley all to myself today. I'm excited, man. I'm ready to get out. There's a 100% chance that ashley will get kissed today. This will be a good start. And obviously, In a place like chiang mai, anything's possible. (man) you're a lucky man. You're a lucky man, my friend. You are a lucky man. I am a lucky man. How's it going, guys? Hi. Good to see you. Hi. Good to see you. You ready for our date? I am. (blake) ashley looked amazing. I had my first definite twinge of jealousy. (ben c.) we were all thinking the same thing, to be honest. We all thought she looked incredible. We thought she looked hot. All right, you ready? Yeah. All right, boys. Man : see you, benny. I'm sure--well, hopefully I'll see you again. Man : you'll be back. Ben f. And ashley have visible chemistry, and that's tough for a lot of us to handle. Their chemistry came quickly. They fell for each other pretty quickly On the last date at the orphanage. I think a lot of us wish we were there. It's been tough. The clock is ticking. We're halfway through this process. This is getting serious. Ooh. First real date. I know. How you feelin'? Um, I am very excited. (giggles) (ben f.) ashley and I's romance has been good to this point, and I've been taking, like, slow, gradual steps Every time we spend time together. And to be able to build on the foundation of love In--in a place like this, I only see it progressing a little bit more today. I think this is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been in my life. Isn't it? Yeah. Ashley : ben and I spent a lot of time together On the last group date, and there's This mutual attraction between us, but it hasn't been spoken. Hey, thanks again for picking me today. You're welcome. Thanks for coming. Looking forward to it. Yeah. And I just don't know if he's at a point Where he's ready to allow somebody in. Whoa! Took-took. Took-took. Whoo! (laughs) ? Whoo! So fun. (ben f. Speaks indistinctly) Ashley : whoo-hoo! I want the guys to have a lot of fun here and experience new things that they've never experienced before but I also want to balance that with real life. Oh, I want to buy a dress! Ben f.--Today I'm gonna see if he can handle that. Oh, yeah! Oh, my gosh. I love this stuff. Ashley : this marketplace is incredible. There is music going. I can see food being grilled. (ben f.) oh, man. (singsongy) street food! Can we have two? Getting a taste of thai culture with ashley was Everything I wanted from coming over here. Wow. Love it? Get it. I would love to get it for you. (ashley gasps) (ben f.) I love it here. I love everything about it. I love the people. I love the culture. A little tight. Your head's too big. (laughs) it feels like I'm on vacation with my girlfriend, and we're just kind of out, cruising the market. ? Oh! Ashley : the day's been so great with ben. He's being such a good sport, being able to be goofy and fun. Those are some of the qualities That I'm looking for in a husband. Initially, I knew he was good-looking, but the more I get to know him, the hotter he becomes. See, that's what I want to learn how to do-- Little birds like that. Ooh. I wonder if she knows how to draw an elephant. Probably not. Probably not as good as you. What kind of birds do you think those are? Lovebirds. Oh. Match made in heaven. (laughs) match made in heaven. Coming into this date, I didn't think there was gonna be that romantic, You know, that spark or that attraction that was Gonna make me always want to touch him or hold his hand, and it was there. It just feels right. How's it coming? (laughs) Here's mine. Now see, that's cute! Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. I think we should put 'em on our mantel. Um, and where do you propose we move to? Are you proposing already? (giggles) (ben f.) how beautiful is ashley? You know, I'm beginning to kind of see her As a potential fiancée, wife of mine. Here, I'll hold these guys so you can hold my hand. See, this is thailand to me. The only thing I wanted to do was, like, Walk around the market and go see ancient ruins and temples. Are you serious? Yeah. Oh, my... Oh... My... God! I've never seen anything like this in my entire life. To see this big temple, my jaw drops. It's one of the coolest things I've ever seen In my entire life. No better person to share it with Than ashley. This has been an awesome day, An unbelievable day. Yeah, no, I, um, I like where this is headed. Me, too. I'm so glad you came. (high-pitched voice) thanks for having me. (chuckles) So... You know we can't kiss here? (normal voice) oh, really? Mm-hmm. That's how sacred this place is. That's gonna be tough. Is it? As much of a romantic setting that it is, and I want to go in for a kiss, I couldn't, because we are close to the temple, and it's sacrilegious. It's not allowed. No--no kissing. It is really difficult. Mm-hmm. (chuckles) um... Mm. (clicks tongue) you're tempting me. I know, but we can't. Um, no. It's not allowed. But I'm thinking it. Me, too. Yeah. Let's do it, like, in our head, kiss. Mental kiss. Mm. Mm. That was good. It was real good. Real good. Real good. I guess we'll just have to make up for it later... Mm-hmm. Yes. At dinner. Mm. I really feel like ben likes me. I really do feel that. This was fun, but let's go. (laughs) There's so much tension building up in this moment. I just wanna jump on him. (growls) Let's go to dinner. (laughs) So I can only imagine what tonight's gonna bring. (laughs) (insects chirping) If you'd like to date The next bachelor or bachelorette, Go to bachelor.Abc.Com and click apply." Hi, ash. Hello! You look nice. Thank you. How are you? My date is going better than I could have ever thought. Everything about ben is so comfortable. I like. I like. After today, I feel like he's been my boyfriend For a long time now. I'm so excited to show you where we're going. This evening--it's gonna be so romantic and it's gonna be The most beautiful outdoor dinner That ben f. Has ever seen. What? (laughs) What do you think? Um, it's beautiful. (ben f.) it was one of the most breathtaking settings I've ever seen in my entire life. There are thousands of flowers Arranged in this intricate pattern Surrounding the, uh, dinner table-- Just really amazing. It's incredible. Every time you think it gets... Mm-hmm. You know, it's good, it gets better. Yeah. Wow. And romantic, huh? Very romantic, yeah. I think that feelings are really starting to develop, and... You know, we had a wonderful day today, and I... Have a feeling that it's gonna be a wonderful evening, too. How gorgeous is this? Um, it's unbelievable. Everything we did today was out of the ordinary. Well, I liked it because it wasn't so extravagant, So you can see kinda how we... Interacted. Like, we relied on each other to make it fun. Right. So I loved that. Mm-hmm. Me, too. This isn't yours, is it? No. Aw! That's good, though. Really? Mm-hmm. This actually tastes a lot like ours, 'cause-- I loved the wine that you brought me the first night. Yeah. It was so good. I'm glad. I wanna hear how that started. Um, one of my best friends from sonoma growing up, Uh, in, uh, we were best friends since middle school-- We learned how to make wine and are two vintages in now, and it's... That's so cool. The most fun profession on the planet. So what do you do on a day-to-day? What would your day-to-day life be? During harvest--September, October--I'd be making wine. Mm-hmm. I'd be out in the fields, you know... Just... Picking grapes, bringing the fruit in. Could I help you? Absolutely. So cool. Yeah. Um, I didn't--I mean, I haven't told you this, but where I was probably, like, a year ago, I wasn't emotionally available. Okay. And I wouldn't have been ready To do something like this ever... Mm-hmm. Kind of take a chance, and I think a lot of that Kinda stems from my father's passing. That was about four and a half years ago. Really? Yeah. I mean, and that's the thing, too. He was, uh, present in my life always. He was--he was always around. He loved my mother. Um, he loved his children. Mm. He was, like, a big--obviously a big part of my life. So I think in the previous four and a half years, Just been relatively guarded, you know, You love someone unconditionally and so much, You don't want anyone else to make you feel The way that, you know, you felt before. So I think even when I would date women, I wasn't being very fair or true to them Because I was just an emotional zombie. For me, in the last year, I've really kind of come to terms and realized that my father's passing is a part of life, and I've really embodied everything that he stood for. It's helped me grow and--and mature as a person, and it's made me into the man that I am today... Mm-hmm. And the man that I plan on being, Because he was such a wonderful role model. You know, I got 24 formidable, solid years out of my father, and that's been more than most people get in a lifetime. Mm-hmm. And so I kind of count my blessings. So what was it that kind of snapped you out of it? A year ago, I really kind of took it upon myself To start being more of a, I don't know, a better son and a better brother. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm. Less selfish. And so I think that's what changed. I realized that I need to start taking down these walls, These emotional walls. Good. Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're in a good place. ? (bell rings) Man : get that, buddy. It's a group date card. They'll name off everyone that's going on the group date. The two people that are left-- That's who's going on the two-on-one. Nobody wants to go on the two-on-one. Man : all right, brother. Man : good luck, gentlemen. Constantine... Ames... Nick... Blake... Man : oh. Lucas... Man : wow. Ryan... Oh. (chuckles) (man chuckles) J.P... Man : oh! Man : whoo! Man : all right. And mickey. Man : oh! (william) I knew it. So myself and ben c.--That's who's going on the two-on-one. The two-on-one is, you know, a nightmare date Because no matter what, it's a 50/50. It's like flipping a coin. Somebody's gonna be going home At the end of that date. It's intense. (william) ben c... Man : wow. Break you. ? So what do you want to do now when you find-- When you're in another relationship, What is--what's your agenda? My agenda? Travel? My agenda is--is focus on her and, you know, obviously, You know, travel would be a big part of that, you know... Mm-hmm. Of the relationship. You know, spending time together, Nights in, cooking, You know, wine parties... Mm-hmm. Get-togethers with my friends and--and her friends, Your friends. Um... Mm. Just making her the priority, Kind of spoiling someone else for once... Mm-hmm. Is kind of the agenda. You know-- Grow together, you know? Yeah. I know what you mean. Yeah. Ben is saying everything that I was hoping to hear, and after our date tonight, I've realized That I could see a life with ben--an everyday life. For the first time in a long time, I'm feeling hopeful. I'm really, really happy that you're here, and I'm more happy to hear how ready you are to be here. Mm-hmm. So, ben, will you accept this rose? I will accept that rose. Already at this point, it's kind of, like, The day's been so great, you know, How could it really get any better? But through every experience with ashley, that holds true, So I think that from here on out, It's gonna get a whole lot better. (gasps) Cool! ? Sitting here with ashley feels right, and it's almost as if, you know, I have that little playful, giddy, Puppy-dog love kind of thing inside of me. ? Ashley : I've been waiting all day for this moment, and sure enough, just so much passion between us. And I just keep thinking about how lucky I am To be here with him. Ben is the kind of guy that I think I could fall in love with, and this could be the beginning of a very happy ending for me. Coming up... Now equal fight. Ohh! Wow. All of us look at each other. We're like, the heat is on. Oh, no! Someone's gonna get their ass kicked, and it cannot be me. Ashley : I had no idea this was gonna turn out to be Such a bloody fight. (siren wailing) how did I let this happen? (heart beating) I am absolutely petrified. (trumpets) Ashley : whoa! The pressure's on. It's two dudes, one girl. It's time for me to make the move. I'm not throwing the guy under a bus or anything, but I'll be completely honest. I wonder what's gonna happen. (gong crashes) Man : let's go! Let's go! The date card said, "love is worth fighting for," But I'm not sure that's taken literally to mean You're gonna have to fight with your hands. But, uh, I definitely think love is worth fighting for. It really strikes a chord with me. You know, it's important for me to show ashley That I'm really here for her. (man speaks indistinctly) (J.P.) I friggin' hate these group dates. They're an experience, but I don't really think They build on my relationship with ashley, So I'm excited to see ashley, but at the end of the day, I want more one-on-one time. (horn honks) Ashley : I had such a great date with ben f. Last night, but today's completely different. There are gonna be eight guys on this date today. I'm excited to see how they react to everything. Good. Good. Good. Okay, go. Oh, shoot. I want the guys to have a lot of fun here in thailand, To see what things are traditional to thai culture, So this date is a perfect example of that. Hey, guys. Welcome. Yeah, yeah! Man : so stoked. Good to see all of you guys. You, too. You guys wanna see my pink gloves? Aren't they so cute? (all laugh) All right, so today we're gonna be training with some Of the top trainers in the world for muay thai boxing. Yeah, yeah! And I will tell you they're pretty intense. (singsongy) so let's get started! I was hoping, when we came to thailand,  That I'd have the opportunity to just see muay thai fighting. I'm actually doing it? This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience That I'll never forget. (man shouts indistinctly) (grunts) (laughs) I believe muay thai is a form of martial arts or kickboxing. It started here in thailand, and it seems like Kind of their national sport. (grunts) (ames) hands, fists, legs-- anything goes. Really, it's pretty wild. Ashley : I'm so excited to watch this. This is a really hot way to see the men, to see if I could find, Like, masculinity in these guys. This is awesome. What a cool date. Ashley : I know, right? Muay thai boxing I have no clue about, but, uh, yeah, I've been in some street fights. We're actually training In one of the most prestigious muay thai training facilities In the world. Everybody was amped up. Ames. I am sumit. Sumit? Yeah. (ames) I have not been in a fight in my life. We could end up with black eyes, broken noses. Who knows? But, uh, ashley's worth it. Oh, boy. Here we go. Nick, I have high hopes for you here. Thanks. (laughs) (laughs) I'm glad one of us does. (laughs) Man : go for it. Ashley : okay. Again. Again. Again. Come on, man! Okay. Oh. (giggles) Muay thai boxing-- The craziest workout I've ever had in my entire life. We have one-two combination punches, we're doing push-ups To exhaustion, crunches while getting our stomachs pounded in. No! Go. Okay, go. (man shouts indistinctly) I felt bad, but it was still kind of hot. (laughs) Man : come on! Go get him! I don't know what the (bleep) they're saying, but it's definitely motivating. When anyone yells at you, It's motivating when you're working out. Oh, my god. (laughs) These guys do not let up. I'm like, "hey, I need a breather. I need a breather." (imitates thai accent) no. No. Do sit-up. Do sit-up. Good. When ashley was, uh, showing off her boxing moves, You know, it was hot. Man : nice! Man : wow! (blake) spandex was invented for people like her. It's a good look. Man : okay. Again. Oh, again. Oh! Oh, ho ho! (laughs) you're too nice. You have to become mean for it. I guess so. For a minute. Just for a minute. Yeah. All right. You know, a lot of people like to do muay thai at home For exercise or for fun. I'm generally a little more reserved, So I might have to come out of my shell and kick some ass. Nice, ames! Your hand get down. Keep up. Keep up. Yeah. This one--no. You understand? Come on. Okay. The muay trainer's very intense, but the most dangerous person here is clearly ashley, Because any time she says good luck," You stop paying attention, and you get an elbow in the face Or something like that. Nice, ames. Up. And--ooh! (laughs) It's okay. Hey, guys, come on over. So we've now been training for about three hours. Everyone is just dripping with sweat, and then ashley unveils new kickboxing gear. Men : yeah! Ashley : so grab your colors, guys. Man : nice. The men looked great today, but I wanna see The guys in this fighting gear. It's gonna be hot. Pretty much every color of the rainbow is represented In the set of uniforms, and everybody jumps To their favorite. I just saw a pair of red shorts Right in front of me, and I just grabbed 'em. But ames is so polite. He just waited his turn and... Man : this one's your color. (men laugh) (ames)I don't mind. You know, I can take it. If it makes ashley remember me, so much the better. Okay, you learned muay thai today, and now you go fight. Okay? Follow me. Come here. Man : oh! The adrenaline's pumping. We're trying to figure out What we're gonna do. Are we gonna fight? Are we gonna train? And then ashley piles us into this open-air taxi, and what was going through my mind is That we're actually gonna do this. We're gonna fight somebody, maybe even each other. No way this is happening. (bell dings) (men shouting indistinctly) Ow! (grunts) (man shouts in thai) (man groans) (grunts) When I stepped out of that truck, and I'm in these goofy shorts with my chicken legs, Saw the boxing ring, and I said, Holy (bleep). (chuckles) Oh! (speaks thai) There had to have been at least 150, 200 people Just gathered around, and these two guys are inside of it, Sparring. (speaks thai) This is brutal. I've seen it on TV, but thai boxing is brutal. Oh! Man : dude, did you see that? He just knocked him out. Man : yeah, dude, yeah. That guy just got knocked out. Man : yeah. (man speaks thai) (blake) wow. At this point, I'm just totally freaked out, Because I'm thinking, this is gonna be ugly no matter what. We pull up to this square, and the fight ends With a reverse elbow shiver To one of the guys' faces and knocks him out cold. All of us look at each other, and we're like, wow. It's on, guys. (chuckles) it is on. (man speaking thai over p.A.) (J.P.) I'm freaking out. I am the smallest guy out here, but I don't want to show any fear. I don't want to be, you know, the guy that looks like A little girl in front of-- in front of ashley, you know? I'm nervous for you guys. I bought boxing gloves one time when I was about 15 years old. Me and my buddy hit each other in the face once-- (pops lips) done. Never again. (speaking thai, amplified voice) (cheering) Lucas--blue corner. Blake--red corner. Ashley : the first guys to fight are blake versus Lucas. I just hope they have fun with it and don't take it too seriously. I think, uh, today's gonna be my day to shine, you know, It's important for me to show ashley, you know, I'm more than just a dentist, and I wanna show her That, uh, love is worth fighting for, in my eyes. I'm nervous. (man speaks thai) (bell dings) Man : oh, hey! Man : luc! Luc! Hey! Man : hand up, hand up, hand up, hand up. Men : oh! Oh! Woman : oh! Man : hand up! Hand up! (grunts) Ryan : this is testosterone at its finest. A bunch of competitive men fighting amongst each other and fighting for ashley-- I mean, you couldn't make A more intense, uh, environment than what's going on right now. Oh, gosh. I'm beginning to think that this date is A little bit too dangerous. I don't want anyone to get hurt. (speaks thai) Man : oh! Oh! (man shouting in thai) Man : oh! Man : it's over. Man : oh! Man : whoo! Wow. (speaks thai) Big tex went down. He went down hard and took him down early. Today's victory kinda put A little extra, you know, bounce in my step, and, uh, maybe a little added confidence. Ashley : you were awesome out there. Nice job. I try. (man) mickey--red corner With J.P.--Blue corner. (J.P.) I'm definitely concerned, but I'm not gonna show it. Um, and if I've gotta go in there and take a beating Like a man, I'm gonna take a beating like a man, and there's no, you know, there's no-- There's no crying in muay thai. (man speaks thai) (bell dings) (speaks thai) Man : oh! Oh! Hey! Oh! Hey! Man : kick! Kick! (ashley gasps) Oh, no! No! No, no, no, no, no! (man laughs) No! Ohh! Man : oh! Man : jab. Jab. Man : oh, hey! Oh! Man : right kick. Right. Right. Can we call this? No, I don't want to see this anymore. Yeah, you can set up the date. Ashley : I'm cringing when I see mickey Throwing punches at J.P. Up there. It really makes me realize that I have such strong feelings For these guys, and I don't want to see anybody get hurt. I gotta beat the (bleep) out of him Or he's gonna beat the (bleep) out of me, and someone's gonna get their ass kicked, and it cannot be me. (men shouting indistinctly) Oh! Man : kick! Kick! Kick! Men : oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Oh! (bell dings) Number one! (cheering) The jew from long island Kicked the irishman's ass from cleveland. Just getting that out there. Man : see what we're doing for you, ash? I know. I don't want you guys to do this anymore. Flying around the world for you is one thing. Man : come on, ame-o. Man : come on, ames. (ames) I have not been in a fight in my life. My take on physical violence is That there's pretty much always another way, and usually, I'll seek that way. (Lucas) ames is out of his element in this situation. He's been studying at harvard and yale forever While we were all being idiots and fighting in the street. Man : come on, ames! Ryan : you know, I'm gonna put a little bit extra effort in, That's for sure. I want ashley to notice. I'm gonna give it my all, and I'm hoping later on tonight, That rose is right there with my name on it. (bell dings) (speaks thai) Man : whoo! Men : oh! (man speaks indistinctly) Men : oh! (speaks thai) Man : get your hands out, ame-o! Good job, ames! Ashley : as I'm watching ames, I am literally shaking. I am so nervous for him. (mickey) keep your hands up, ame-o! Man : throw that right! Throw the right, ame-o! Ohh! Man : come on, ames! Let's go, boy! Ashley : oh, ho! (men shouting indistinctly) Man : kick! Kick! Kick! Ashley : oh, ho ho! Man : this is gonna get nasty. Man : oh, my god! Man : wait, did you see that? Man : wow. (man speaks thai) (punches thud) Ames got whaled by Ryan, you know? (mickey) those are violent shots to the head. It's an awful feeling. ? (bell dings) (cheering) Ames had the haymaker up, had the right hand. He was--he wanted to throw it so bad. We're like, "right hand! Throw the right hand!" didn't do it. (speaks thai) (cheering) (J.P.) ames lost and was clearly woozy afterwards. I mean, eyes were glassy, You know, he--he was cloudy. He--he was in bad shape. You all right, ames? I'm great. Thank you. You did so good out there. Thank you. So good. Oh, my gosh. You have a bloody nose. I tell you what. All of us were concerned for ames. (mickey) his eyes were-- clearly bloodshot, He had a bloody nose. Um, you know, it was pretty clear that he got his bell rung. (bell dings) (man speaks thai) Ryan : so then it's the heavyweight battle-- Big nick and constantine. Man : right kick. Right kick. You know, I'm kinda checking in on ames, and something's not right. Man : right kick. Right kick. Men : oh! Ashley : I cannot even focus On the fight that's happening right now. I am so concerned about ames. He says that he's fine, but I can really tell that he's shaken up. All right. I'll be back. (speaks thai) Men : oh! Man : oh, ho ho! Oh, ho ho! Man : oh, ho ho! Man : whoo-hoo! (speaks thai) (man speaks thai) Man : just a little worried about you. (speaks indistinctly) It's weird, but it'll be better, I'm sure. What is it--what are you-- what are you feeling right now? Not myself at all. It's really strange. Really? So sorry. Have a good time. I'm so sorry, really. Bye, ames. (man speaks thai) (siren wailing) Ashley : watching ames drive away, I'm hoping that he's okay, but I'm scared right now. I had no idea that it would go this far, Especially for ames. (horn honks, siren wailing) (police radio chatter) ? (speaking thai) (gong crashes) ? (sighs deeply) Ashley : at the end of the day today, the morale was down. I had no idea this was Gonna turn out to be such a bloody fight. I thought it was gonna be a really fun thing, and I thought everyone was gonna bond, but it actually, You know, blew up right in my face. Ames left the fight in an ambulance. I wanna see if he's back. I wanna see if he's doing well. But after everything that happened today, I'm not sure if he's even gonna be there. Oh (bleep). Nice to see you all. We're in this amazing environment. Ashley looks beautiful, you know, everything's perfect, Except for one thing--I mean, ames is glaringly missing. I mean, the last we've seen him is Leaving the fighting ring to go to the hospital. We're all hopeful that he's gonna show up this evening. We're hoping. How you guys doing? Man : good. Moving a little slowly. Man : so pass 'em down. Ashley : moving slowly? Comfortably numb at this point, yeah. Oh, no. I'm so sorry. I've been thinking about it, and I feel really bad that everything kinda turned out The way it did, and I know ames isn't here... Man : yeah. And I'm hoping that he's gonna be here at some point. Man : it'll be fine. Man : he'll be all right. I wouldn't want the night to be ruined or lost Because of everything that happened, so... Man : yeah. The mood is definitely down at the party tonight. With ames still being in the hospital, I almost feel Like there's a dark cloud over the whole night. What a day, huh? How was today? Okay. I mean, uh, Getting out there battling... Mm-hmm. You were awesome. And, uh, I would not classify me as awesome. I felt so bad to do that to ames, man. Oh, my gosh. And who knew-- you have a bruise on your eye. I do, yeah. (gasps) I have a-a squirrel right here, and then do you see on the nose? Oh, my gosh! Oh, my goodness. Everyone went so hard today, and with ames in the hospital, I'm having a hard time Really focusing on my other relationships. Yeah. I don't even want to know what it's like to get hit. Well, I think, honestly, I think that was part of the issue With--with some of the guys, like, with ames, in particular. You know, he's just never been punched before. If you've never taken a good shot to the-- have you? Yeah, you know, I mean, when you take that first shot, It kinda wakes you up. Oh, gosh. Man : I'm wondering if ames is gonna show his face again. Man : I hope. Man : you think he's embarrassed at all? No, he was in pink shorts and... Man : dude, the guy has seven degrees. No, I think he looked good in the pink shorts, actually. Man : seriously, if anyone can wear pink shorts... (ames) hey! Man : ames! Man : nice to see you. Man : how you doing, man? Man : I'm sorry. Ryan : it's great to see ames show up. Thank you. We were all worried about him. But ames showed up with his usual smile. It is great to see ames back with the boys. (ames) nice to see you guys. Ashley : oh, is that ames? (mickey) yeah. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. I wonder how he's doing. Let's go check on him. Yeah. Glad you're up and about. Thanks so much. Once-in-a-lifetime. I hope once-in-a-lifetime and never again. Ames! Hi. How are you? I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad I'm here, too. Come on. Follow me. Follow me. How you doing? Okay. Great. Great? Dizzy, but good. Oh, no! All right, well, here, hold my hand. Let's go. All right. Thanks. Ames, I'm so glad that you're here. I'm so glad that you're okay. I'm so glad to be here, ashley. So how are you feeling? Totally a little disoriented but good. Just dizzy? Just dizzy. Ashley comes over to check on me, and I find it's really hard to speak to her. I usually have trouble speaking to her 'cause she's beautiful, but this time I can't speak to her Because my head is just not working. (chuckles) I'm so sorry about everything that happened today. Yeah. Well, no, it was great. It was... Yeah. I had all these romantic things to say, but I just forget them all. You know? (laughs) No, you don't have to say anything. You don't have to remember anything. No. So what kind of instructions did they give you? Did various kinds of tests and things. Okay. And I was told that I'm totally in love, and... (laughs) would you stop it? And they also said I have a mild concussion. But, uh... (laughs) oh, no! You shouldn't even be here. Uh, no, no. I should be here. Very happy to see you. Ames, I am so sorry about everything that happened today. No, I am so sorry. You need a hug. Of course. God. You look beautiful. Thanks. Ames. Yeah. Oh, my god. You scared the crap out of me. I am totally useless in conversations. Really? I'm so embarrassed. And the next time I see you, I will do a better job of charming you. (chuckles) no, you're being kind of charming right now, actually. I'm not. I'm not. Rain check on hanging out. Okay. Let's take you back. Yep, let's do it. Let's get you settled in. Water and food and anything you want. Totally. Yeah. (ben f.) are you guys looking forward to tomorrow? Are you dreading tomorrow? What's--what's the, uh, What's the feeling? There's some anticipation. Uh, it's a little bit stressful, the format of it. But... What, for yourself? Yeah. Looking forward to it. Yeah. It's the thunderdome date-- two man enter, one man leave. We'll see what happens. Yeah. A battle. Definitely has a gladiator feel to it. 
 
 (knock on door) Aha. I'm gettin' this one. (exhales deeply) There's a little awkwardness going into tomorrow, but I'm really trying not to think about it. William and I are very different. I think that I may have become, in his mind, A target a little bit. "ben c. And william." Hey. Fancy that. "guide me to love. Love, ashley." There is one more card. "two men, one rose, "one stays, one goes. Signed, Chris harrison." Well, "guide me to love..." I-I can tell her which way not to go. Who has two thumbs and is gonna win the rose on the two-on-one date? This guy. Ashley : can you guys believe that he had a concussion... Man : no. And he's here? Well... And look at him. Ryan : oh, no, he looks great. Thanks, man. (laughter) Ashley : I'm so relieved that ames is back and he's gonna be okay. Now I feel like I can really focus all my attention On the guys that are here. Well, I'm so glad you're here. Yeah. I'm glad to be here. Makes the night complete, I think. Yeah. I think so. Man : it is good to see you back. Man : well done. (blake) I was very happy to see him come back. But tonight, now it's time to focus on ashley. And going into tonight, I know that I'm on a short list Of people who have not had a romantic moment with ashley. So I feel like I'm in a bit of jeopardy If I don't try and bridge the gap between Friendly talks and a more, you know, romantic undertone. I would love for this to work out and keep progressing, and I, you know, I feel like I'm very quiet or shy, Like I told you. Mm. And I'm starting to notice that That's a bit of a-a setback, you know. I don't think it's a setback. I don't. Things are a little bit slower between us, but... It... That's-- That's just the way it is. You know what? Love is a marathon. It's not a sprint. And, at least in my experience, The relationships that are just instantly passionate and so fast out of the gate Seem to kind of burn out more quickly. Yeah. Ashley : blake had a really interesting point. He said that he doesn't trust relationships That are hot out of the gate. Immediately, I thought of bentley, and what we had was so immediate, but it was short-lived. So maybe blake has a good point here. I'm not discounting chemistry by any means. You definitely have to have an attraction to someone. Mm-hmm. Having not really spent any large amount of time with me, I've questioned that more than anything. "maybe she's not even attracted to me, so..." You really believe that? I'm... I've been here for a while... Mm. And haven't really gotten a whole lot of... I don't know. Reassurance? Yeah. A little positive reinforcement, I guess. Yeah. There been any more talk about that rose? It's a tough decision with the rose. Man : you ready to throw names out? I'll throw names. I think, uh, I think my gut tells me Lucas, but I think that-- that J.P.'s right there. What do you think, girl? Lucas! What do you think? You're more comfortable now. I feel more comfortable. I enjoyed today. You know, having a little eye contact with you... Mm-hmm. Is not a bad thing, you know. Right. And... I don't know. Well, someone was saying that you boxed. No. No. I'm a golfer. You're a golfer?! Huge golfer. I've never played golf in my life. Oh. I'm just a-- will you show me how to... Absolutely. Can you show me right now? I could. Let's do it. Yeah. What do you want to do? I want you to show me how-- just pretend. Okay. Yeah. You have to do that, like, you know, clich? Like, you have to get behind me... Yeah. Oh. So sexy. (laughs) so sexy. All right, how do we do this? Okay, now you turn around and watch me for a second. Okay. Okay, you wanna be straight arms... Right. Straight arms, okay. Ball's right here. And you always wanna cock your wrists. Ooh, you look good doing that. Thank you. Okay, hold on. Show me again. So you're like this... Are your feet parallel to your shoulders? Do I bend my knees? Absolutely bend your knees. Do I stick out my butt? Oh, god. (slaps hands) no! What? You are so cute. (laughs) no, I'm being serious. I don't know. You're so cute. Okay. Oh, my god. (laughs) oh! Is that good? Yeah. Okay. Okay, my arms are straight. I want a full shoulder turn. Okay. Ready? Perfect. (laughs) Boom! (laughs) (laughs) Ashley : Lucas is pretty smooth with the ladies. He gave me a little golf lesson tonight. I'm not gonna lie. I was pretty turned on. (giggles) Fore! So what's your type? I don't really have a type. I mean.... Yeah. Your--your type, I think, is, honestly, like bentley and stuff like that. Like, you really were attracted to a certain... How could you tell? I just... I can... See it your eyes. I can see the flirtatious, you know... Type things, but... Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I'm still trying to figure out What I feel for everybody. Mm-hmm. I think, initially, I'm really attracted to, maybe, Somebody like bentley. Right. But... In terms of a long-term relationship, I think that I need to explore a little bit more because... Right. I don't think That my initial instincts might be right for me forever. And I love what I'm seeing with everybody. Mm-hmm. And you're one of those people. Every time I meet with Lucas, I feel like I like him more and more. I feel really good About the way everything's going, Even without bentley being there. I wish I had a handful of roses to give out. But I only have one, and I've made my decision. Hey, guys. Men : hi. I'm just coming to steal this. Men : ah! Ryan : thought so. I'll be back. Ryan : oh, boy. (sighs) What I would give to have that rose... With each step she's taking, you know, Your heart drops a little bit more. You're like... Oh, man. Really? Are you surprised? I don't know. Ahh. So... I know sometimes you question whether you should be here Or how I feel. So I just wanted to give you the reassurance That, you know, you deserve. So I'm in this if you're in this. And I think we have great potential If we keep moving forward. I would agree with that whole-heartedly. Okay, good. So I just wanted to know, blake, will you accept this rose? Of course I will. Yay! All right. I wanna see if I can get this on you now. Getting the rose-- It put an instant smile on my face. I can't tell you... I mean, it feels good to get a rose At the rose ceremony, but this... Mm-hmm. You know, this is definitely a step in the right direction. If we keep going, you know, the--the way we're going, I definitely see potential. She's the type of girl that, you know, I look for. If I end up with ashley in the end, and, you know, we're married one day, It's gonna be so fun to look back and--and say, you know, Chiang mai is where it really all kind of started to happen and--and it's gonna be such a--such a great story, you know. Be a good thing to tell our kids. Man : all worth it. I just wanna say that I am... So happy with the way everything's going, and thank you, guys, so much for everything. And, ames, um this cheers is to you... Man : yeah. For being such a great sport and still being here. Man : absolutely. And so I wanna cheers to ames tonight. Cheers to ames. Men : cheers, ames. Man : ames! Thank you very much. Man : cheers. Coming up... I will say that I was a little worried about the two-on-one. The pressure's on. It's two dudes, one girl. Can we talk? (chuckles) yes, we can talk. (william) I thought to myself, I'm losing the rose in this moment. I'm not throwing the guy under a bus or anything, but he's, in a way, ready to go home. What's going on in that head? Ryan : immediately, you could tell That ashley was just not right. I'm willing to put this in the past. The truth is, I'm still thinking about bentley. I need to stop. (whispers) I need to stop thinking about this. (elephants trumpet) (elephant trumpets) Ashley : today, I'm going on my first two-on-one With ben c. And william. I can relate to how hard this two-on-one can be 'cause I was on it with a close friend of mine. (snorts) This is awesome. Ashley : I don't know What the dynamic between william and ben c. Is, So it's gonna be interesting to see how things play out today. Hopefully, they can be themselves So I can really see which relationship would work. Hey, guys. (william and ben c.) hey. Good to see you guys. It's good to see you. Good to see you, too. How are you? Good. How are you? (ben c.) feeling pretty good despite the fact That I have this two-on-one date looming. Um, and it's a little stressful, but, uh, I'm excited about hopefully reconnecting with ashley and, you know, kind of rediscovering The chemistry we had on our first date. The stakes are high, but I feel confident That things will work out as they should today. Um, so I know the dreaded two-on-one date. (chuckles) I know because I've been there. Yeah, you have. I remember that. Un, but I'm hoping we can Kinda just not think about it and just have a lot of fun Throughout the day, and then figure things out as we go. We can do that. Agreed. I think so. So... Sounds good? Yeah. (william) there's a rose at stake, and there's nothing I want more Than to continue this with ashley. If I get the rose today, I... It's gonna turn things around, get me right back on track. I may push you in, though. What's that? Uh-oh! Oh, god. For alone--for alone time, I mean. All's fair in love and war, right? (william) I don't find ben c. Intimidating. And moving forward, it's gonna get a little bit more ruthless. Ben c. Is gonna end up going home. Ashley : all right. We're cruising, guys. We're cruising. (ben c.) it's beautiful. It's cooled down a little bit. Isn't this gorgeous? Look at this. This is awesome. I love this. (william) I felt like a third wheel on the raft. I'm in the front steering. Her and ben c. Get to just talk. Look at those elephants. (trumpets) so cool. (william) I thought to myself, I'm losing the rose in this moment. "is everything going okay back there?" Ahh. This is perfect. Ashley : it is so beautiful here today. The setting is right out of a movie. Two handsome men are guiding me along the river. I mean, it's a pretty good date so far. (trumpets) Ashley : whoa! That's so cool! But at the same time, I know that I have to send a guy home today, and it's weighing heavy on my mind. (trumpets) Whoa! (laughs) (william) pressure's on. It's two dudes, one girl. That's... Awkward. Ashley : oh! (ben c. Chuckles) Whoo! (william) ben c.'s, like, so irritating to me, It is time to turn it up and for me to make the move. Oh, wow. Mm. Thank you, sir. Ahh. (laughs) Uh, ben, here you go. Right here? You're right there. Thanks. (laughs) Here you go. Go enjoy your picnic. Ashley and I are gonna hang out for a little bit. I just noticed that there are three elephants. Two-on-one. The two in the front would be william and ashley. (all laugh) (william) I can be every kind of extreme. I can be the most romantic guy in the room. I can be the funniest guy in the room. I can be the biggest (bleep) in the room. Ben c.'s gotta go... (laughs) And it's not gonna be a pretty sight. So what's up, william? I will say that I was a little worried about the two-on-one When ben was announced. Why? Um, I'll be completely honest. Um... And I'm not--I'm not throwing the guy under a bus or anything. But, to me, when I'm there, I believe that He's, in a way, ready to go home. From what I've heard around the house, he's-- He's more... Looking forward to the dating web sites When he gets off here. How do you know that? He's talked to the guys about it, Kinda what his intentions are and where he's looking to go. Why would he say that to you guys? Wouldn't he think that you guys would tell me? Um... We're kinda... Open, in a way, with each other. Mm-hmm. But he said, "you know, I'm gonna clean up After I get out of here. This is what's gonna happen." Mm-hmm. "I can't wait to get back to town." That gives me so much anxiety in my stomach, You don't even know, 'cause-- Not just for that reason, but it worries me That other people-- It's the same thing for other people, you know? At this point, some people still have you on their minds, Some--some people don't. I'm sorry if you do, like, Feel sick to your stomach or anything right now. No, I guess--I think it just--it's... You know, just highlighting a little bit of an insecurity. But, I mean, I appreciate you telling me 'cause I don't think that you're doing it out of... Malice or I don't think-- no. Yeah. 'cause if--if anything, You have the ability to not even put a rose on the table tonight. I had this huge knot in my stomach. All the insecurities that I had about the guys being here For the right reasons are creeping back up again. I'm so afraid about how vulnerable I'm being With these guys and that they might not be feeling the same way. It makes me really fearful of all of this. And I hope I'm making the right decision. This-- my--my heart is racing right now. I'll tell you guys that. Yeah. Um... So... I wanna end The two-on-one portion of the date. Right now. (singsongy) I wonder what's gonna happen! Ben... I'm gonna be sending you home right now. Okay. (william) the pressure is off. It's not a two-on-one anymore. It's a one-on-one. Have a good day. Talk to you later. How about that rose? Are we--can we talk? (chuckles) yes, we can talk. I have... Something I wanna talk about, actually. Yeah. Um... Very recently, it was brought to my attention That you had been kind of considering online dating. And it really hit me hard because... Can I say something short? Absolutely. Um, it's--I'm--I'm really sorry to hear that. I'm sorry that we didn't get a chance to discuss this... Mm-hmm. Because it's--it's not the case. I have considered my time with you very serious, and I was serious about getting to know you, and I--up until, you know, two seconds ago. And so anything that somebody told you about what I said is, To be honest with you, a little bit of a betrayal Because, um, because I think that person probably knows That I was kidding around, and so it's really hard for me To--to actually hear that right now. You know, I was really dreading this moment. Right. Mm-hmm. But to hear the possibility of you even considering that, It's just--it--it didn't make it easier, but it kind of made me feel like I was doing the right thing. Right. Right. You know, so... I understand. Um... So let's leave it on that note, ben. Yeah, I agree. Coming into this date,  I was dreading saying good-bye to ben c. Or anyone for that matter. But I know it's the right time for ben c. To be going home, Especially after what william has just told me. It was so good to meet you. Good luck. Good luck. Thank you so much, ben. See you later. Bye. Ashley : I'm feeling awful right now. I'm not sending ben c. Home just based on what william told me. But I can't risk keeping somebody around If they don't feel strongly for me. Even though we're in this beautiful setting right now, I have this cloud that's weighing over me and I have this pit in my stomach. I have no idea what's gonna happen anymore. (door squeaks) Man : uh-oh. That's ben's. Man : oh, what? Oh, what? Who was that? This is william's. Man : no way! (J.P.) that was ben's. Man : yeah. (blake) wow. Holy (bleep). Man : wow. ? (ben c.) I'm in complete shock. I'm just completely blown away. I have no idea what just happened. It was totally unexpected. I was dreading that moment. (chuckles) (ben c.) coming into this, I was really hoping and being optimistic That ashley could be the one that lasts. I wanted this to be my thing. I wanted to fall in love. I wanted the dream just like everybody else. (william) whoo! (chuckles) (ben c.) and I'm upset if william tried to sabotage me. I don't think that william will end up being ashley's husband. (laughs) it's very refreshing. (ben c.) they've got their own path to go down now. It's very disheartening to have come this far To ultimately realize this wonderful, amazing love story is not gonna ultimately be mine. What a terrible way for things to end. Pfft. Terrible, terrible way for things to end. It's a shame. (crickets chirping) Ashley : going on the two-on-one date today, I didn't really know what was gonna come of it. After I spoke to william, I knew that I just had to send ben c. Home. Wow. (speaks indistinctly) oh, boy. Ah. So nice. Ashley : my first date with william  Was honestly the best date I had ever been on. And coming into tonight, I'm hoping that Those sparks start flying again. That's--that's the best case scenario tonight. To hoping that I can get back to where I once was with you. Very sweet. Cheers to that. (clink) (william) ashley made the best decision today When she let ben c. Go. So I'm grateful that it's a one-on-one now and there's nobody else there. You know, I'm much more relaxed tonight, but the pressure's still on 'cause there's still a rose on the line. I still don't know if I have it, but that's what I'm hoping for. In a way, I-I feel good and bad About coming out with what I talked about today. Mm-hmm. I'm really glad that you, you know, You trust me and you listen to what I say. You didn't even question it. Yeah. Um, that says a lot, and I was skeptical in the last two weeks As to maybe how you truly felt about me. And to have something like that happen, It really brings me back around and shows that you do care. Mm-hmm. And I'm really excited To--to be a part of this whole thing and to be sitting next to you again. I'm actually getting another one-on-one date. Yeah, which is nice. I, uh... And... (laughs) I gotta tell you, I-I'm ecstatic. I really am. Good. I-I'm... This again, Sitting next to you... Mm-hmm. Uh, I'm definitely happy again. Good. I'm glad. Yeah. Ashley : william's definitely at ease tonight. I think because ben c.'s gone, he is assuming that he's staying Regardless of what happens. But inside, I know that this is really a test for us. I have not yet decided Whether or not he is gonna be getting a rose. (J.P.) william back yet? (blake) I haven't seen him. Assuming he does come back, you think it'll change him? Well, yeah, if you get a little bit of positive reinforcement, It lifts you up just to a whole new level, you know? Yeah. So I think it'll-- I think it'll definitely lift his spirits up a bit. Yeah. Getting a rose-- I mean, if that doesn't snap him out of it, nothing's going to. I think tonight has a lot to tell. Yeah. It'll be interesting to see, for sure. It will. When we first met, you told me-- You said, "I'm a 30-year-old boy." Yeah. (chuckles) do you still feel that way? I mean, I'm a 30-year-old boy in a way, Because I'm not ready to fully, like, grow up. I want to still kinda act a little, You know, like a little kid. Yeah. I can kinda see that a little bit. I'm looking for someone to just, you know, have fun with... Mm-hmm. And keep moving forward and go through All those silly things that happen along the way and the great things that happen along the way. Yeah, um, I can't believe you remember that, but, yeah, 30-year-old boy. Mm-hmm. I still got a lot to do. Sitting here with william at dinner, I keep looking for that feeling that I felt on our first date, and I'm realizing That I don't think I'm ever gonna feel that again. Um... We've been through a lot so far. Mm-hmm. We had such a great first date, and, you know, we had a little bit of a downfall, and my hope was really that we would get back to a place To where we could just move forward. And tonight, I was really looking for that spark again, and I just don't think that it's there. I think that at this point in time, There's no turning back. I'm gonna walk you out. Okay. I thought william and I were so compatible When I first started this, and I never thought that I would not be giving him the rose. But I'm looking for a man. That's what I realized. I had a great time with you. Bye, william. Bye. (exhales deeply) (william) the feeling I have right now... (engine starts) Oh, my god. It's a feeling of being a loser, Looking in the mirror and not being satisfied with yourself. I am the world's-- The world's biggest (bleep) jackass. If I've ever had some fantastic day, There's a (bleep) day to come out of it. Truthfully, honest, that's my life. My life is full of (bleep). What? What? No way! I (bleep) knew it! Take it. Get it outta here. Go ahead. Take it. (chuckles) (william) I honestly don't want to go home. I-I honestly feel something for this girl. I leave here, I go back to nothing, simple as that. (sighs) oh, my god. You know, you sit back and you think about it, and you wish you could do everything in your power To be a man and not a (bleep) idiot. I feel like I don't deserve anything. I don't deserve (bleep). I'll probably just end up slipping back into That dark hole that I have again and slide the rock over the top. I just wanna curl up in bed now and just... Not wake up. ? Ashley : I did not anticipate this date going this way. Sending two guys home-- it's kinda freaking me out. It brings in a whole other truckload of insecurities. How do you know that somebody's telling you the truth? How do you know if people are being genuine here? There's a part of me that's scared That these guys aren't here for me, and I don't know if this is gonna work for me now. And I'm afraid that I'll be all alone in the end. That scares me. (thunder rumbling) ? Ashley : going into this week here in chiang mai, I felt so good. It was my new beginning, and I wanted to be able to move forward with these guys, but yesterday's date With the two-on-one was really difficult. It really made me fearful of this whole process, and it made me a little bit insecure. There she is. Hey, guys. Hi. I'm very in touch with the way I feel, and I feel like something's off tonight. Um, yesterday was so hard. And I realized that from here on out, Saying good-bye is not gonna be easy. Um, so tonight and from here on out, I really just want to start spending time with you guys, and I want you guys to be so true to yourself. And I know that you're not necessarily Gonna fall in love with me. But... I'm looking for somebody To really be honest with how they feel and kinda just be true to that. So, um, cheers to tonight. Men : cheers. Ryan : immediately, You could tell that ashley was just not right. This all comes down to what is ashley feeling? And right now we don't know what she's feeling. This conversation with ashley this evening is really critical. I'm gonna be open with her and honest with her. It's really important that ashley knows that I'm not pulling back earlier connection and feelings for her. So I just want to say, because from the very first night, Like, it was just like a rocket ship, you know... Mm-hmm. Like, immediately, like, feeling so good... Mm-hmm. And then--then the second time we're together again-- I mean, and we haven't even had a one-on-one date yet-- I just wanted you to know that I'm totally into you, and I am looking forward to... (inhales and exhales deeply) what's ahead.... Mm-hmm. And spending more time with you and... And just going forward. Even though we haven't had a one-on-one, I still feel Like our relationship is just where it should be. So don't let that bother you and be patient. I'm--I'm happy with the way things are, like where we're at. Ryan : the mood tonight's been pretty tense. I came here to find out if There's love to be found between ashley and I. It's impossible for me to feel perfectly confident, Because who knows how she really feels about it? But I don't want to go home Until I know that it's there or it's not. The more I get to know you, the more I wanna say, like, You just seem like a real person. Um... Good. I am real, I promise. I'm, like, the biggest dork and goofy girl... Yeah. In the world, and I don't always dress up. You know, I'm just normal... Yeah. And I want you guys to see that side of me, you know? Yeah. But I-I'm so happy that we talked. The last conversation we had was so good. Yeah. I mean, because honestly, out of the gate, you were  One of the guys I was, like, oh, I really wanna get to know him,  And I see so much good in him. And then it was, like, You know, you were honest about, you know... Yeah. You were like, "I don't feel like I like you As much as everyone else does," you know that kind of-- I didn't mean that--I thought about that, and I was like, I hope she kinda understood, like, what I meant to say is that, um, yeah. No, I understand, and I appreciate it, 'cause it's real. Yeah. I think you're gonna give me The same kind of honesty that--that, uh, You expect from me. Do you feel closer to the guys than you do me? (thunder rumbling) naturally. But it's a different kind of close, obviously. Mm-hmm. I'm hoping that, um, tonight you give me a rose... Mm-hmm. And I'm hoping that next week I get an opportunity To spend more time around you. I'm looking forward to that, too, if that comes. Yeah. Yeah. So... I was honest with her. I really wanna figure out, like, What kind of feelings I have for her. You know, right now It's just like--it's a friendly kind of connection that we have, and she kinda said something in her little speech out there About not all the guys are gonna fall in love with her. That kinda shows the vulnerability that she has As a person, because she realizes that you've Gotta love her as just as much as she's supposed to love you. I'm not gonna lie. I don't feel that I know her as well as Some of the other guys do. I want to know before, you know, before hometowns Where I stand with her and how I feel about her. Um, and to be 100% honest with you, I don't have enough of a gut feeling right now to make-- To stand up and say I'm ready to marry that girl. But I'm saying, going into the hometown dates, You've gotta make a decision at one point-- Can you see this girl on your arm, you know, For the rest of your-- you have to make that decision, Because at least for me, taking somebody home and introducing Them to my parents isn't just something I-- Man : it's a big deal. Yeah, it's a big deal. I'm at the point where it's-- I almost feel like I can't-- I can't just see something that I hope to find A connection with somebody. It has to be, like, Already kind of there. The more these relationships move forward, I get this really nervous pit in my stomach. I don't know if I can make anyone happy here right now. I'm not feeling like myself. My biggest fear is I'm gonna fall for somebody and they're not gonna feel the same way, and I'm so scared that what happened with bentley is gonna happen again. I just--I don't know. I want to be sure that it is a two-way street. Do you think you could see, like, Us in the future, like, in normal everyday life? I feel--I kind of-- like order in chinese food? Yeah, like, I kinda feel that's how it is now. Good. The one-on-one--like, this is the time that I love. You know, the one-on-one's-- it's so real that it's, like, This is what-- this is what I want. You're so cute. Thanks. You look beautiful, by the way. Thank you. So do you. Thanks. You know... Mm-hmm. When, uh, when you came to pick up ben for your date, Like, that was the first time it, like, Stung a little bit, and I know it's gonna get harder. I mean, that's just the nature of the beast. But I'm strong enough. I can handle it and-- But right now it just doesn't really feel like There's anybody else. Really? Yeah. So, yeah, I can see it. (thunder rumbles) What's going on in that head? Mm. I like J.P. So much, and I want him to know That what I feel for him is real and that I want him here, but I'm really scared to get hurt, and the truth is, I'm still thinking about bentley. I am. I can't lie about it. Ugh. I need to stop. I need to stop thinking about this. (sighs) I'm losing time with these guys. I'm losing energy and emotion that I could Be putting somewhere else. I think the truth is, I-I do need closure with bentley If I'm gonna move forward with any of the guys. (clinking) Man : my goodness. Ashley : I'm asking the guys to be honest about how they feel. It's kind of hypocritical if I don't do that. I want to be real, but I'm scared right now. Have a good rest of the night, and I'll see you guys very soon. I'm so scared that I'm never gonna be able To get over this bentley thing and that I'll never get the closure that I need To move forward. (thunderclap) (thunderclap) ? Have a seat. How are you feeling? (sighs) um... This week h-has been really great. I honestly feel like I'm getting to a place With a lot of these guys where I'm feeling So strongly about them. Mm-hmm. I think that I've... I think I'm pretty certain As to my core group of guys who I want to move forward with... Yeah. But... (sighs) But there's something else on your mind. There definitely--if I'm gonna be honest with you, Chris, There is something that's on my mind a lot-- A lot more than I want it to be. Yeah, and what is--what is it exactly that's on your mind? Um, I think it's just, you know.. Okay, this-- I just--this has... Right. I have to be open and honest with you right now. I have been thinking a lot lately, Um, about something, and I just feel like in order for me to move forward In these relationships, I really need to put this in the past, and I know you're gonna not be happy with me, but... It's bentley... (thunder rumbles) and... What could've been. And I know it's not a good thing and I don't think it's ideal, and it's not fair to anybody. Right. I think I need to figure out a way How I can close this bentley thing off, Because in the back of my head, it sits there, and I try to repress it, and my head tries to forget about it, but my heart always goes back to it. In times where I need comfort, I think about him. Yeah. That's not normal. No. 'cause I-I feel really strongly about a lot of these guys... Yeah. And I'm starting these relationships that should Be based on honesty and trust, but the truth is, I'm not being honest with them, and that kills me. Yeah. I feel it's getting To the point where it's not really being fair to the guys... I know. That are pining for you and literally fighting for you. All I want to do is respect them and honor them and be so grateful that they've given up so much to be here, and in order for me to pay that respect to them... Right. It has to be with my heart, 100%, and if it's not, I feel guilty. I almost feel guilt-- yeah, that's it. Is that a terrible feeling? I feel guilty, like I'm cheating on somebody right now. Right. It's not fair to these guys. It's not fair to yourself. No. This isn't gonna work. Yes, you're kinda moving forward, but you're kinda not. I know. You know what I mean? Like, I promise you, This is not gonna have a happy ending, the way we're doing it. I know. And that's what I'm so scared of. You can't have, like, your foot half in the pool and then half--it's just not-- that's not the way it works. I know. You're not gonna fall in love like that. So what do you wanna do? There's--I just-- something is telling me That there was something there. Yeah. And if it wasn't real, I'll be happy to move forward... Right. And I'll be fine with that, but what I'm saying is, if we were to put all of the guys That I feel really strongly about in a room with bentley... Yeah. I don't know who-- I don't know what would happen. The only way that I can be 100% in it with these guys is if I can release myself from what's holding me back. I just want to have a clean break... Yeah. So I can start a real, honest relationship. Okay, so how do we... Put this to an end? How do we lay this to rest for good? I don't know what to do, Chris. What do you wanna do? I just want to talk to him and just ask him a couple simple questions. Y-you think this would really... Help you move on? I mean, the truth is, I want a man that also wants to be with me. A relationship is two-sided. Right. So if he told me, you know, "the reason I left is because of this, Is because I just didn't feel strongly enough," Then I would be so respectful of that and understanding and thankful that he told me. But the fact that he left me with the dot, dot, dot Leaves me wondering. Well, we are halfway around the world... Mm-hmm. But you know I'm here for you, so I'm gonna do everything I can To make something happen for you. I'm not--not making any promises. I don't know What that is, but we're gonna make something happen. Mm-hmm. But tonight we gotta focus on what's important, and that is rose ceremony. Nine guys here, One more you're gonna have to send home. Do you know what you're gonna do? I have a pretty good idea of what I'm gonna be doing tonight. Okay, well, I'm gonna go talk to the guys. Put bentley aside. Let's not worry about that. Think about what we have to do tonight. Okay. Thanks, Chris. All right. Good luck. Thank you. Ashley : I honestly cannot believe this is happening. I never would have thought that this would happen. I know people are probably gonna think I'm crazy For holding on to somebody that left me, but all I know is what I felt in that short period of time. I just can't forget about it. I am absolutely petrified. If I don't get closure with bentley, I'm afraid I might never find love here. You know, I have a lot of anxiety in my stomach. I'm scared I'm gonna leave here alone. I don't know what's gonna happen. And it's hard to have come this far and just feel like-- Like you're in the dark. (thunder rumbling) Gentlemen, good evening. Good evening. Another week, another incredible experience. Nine of you left. Ben, blake, the two of you have roses. Nothing to worry about. Six roses to hand out. One of you gentlemen will be leaving us tonight. I wish you all the best. Here's ashley. (whispering) thank you, Chris. Thanks. When you're ready. (normal voice) hey, guys. Hi. Something that I learned this week was Just how important honesty is, especially in this process. I think that's the only way that I'm gonna get to a place With somebody where we have a really true relationship. So my promise to you guys is that I'm gonna be very honest With you about everything, and I hope that you guys Will see this rose ceremony as a display of that, and hopefully, you'll continue to do the same with me. And, um, Thanks for being here. ? Constantine. Constantine, will you accept this rose? I will. (speaks indistinctly) Lucas. Lucas, will you accept this rose? Yes, I will. J.P. J.P., will you accept this rose? Absolutely. Ames. Ames, will you accept this rose? Yes. Mickey. Will you accept this rose? I'd be honored. Ashley, gentlemen, It's the final rose tonight. When you're ready. ? Ryan. (sighs) Ryan, will you accept this rose? (whispers) yes, of course I will. Nick, I'm sorry. Take a moment, say your good-byes. Guys, good luck. (speaks indistinctly) (speaks indistinctly) (sighs) It's all right. I'll miss you. Miss you, too. Good luck with everything, okay? Thank you. (nick) uh, I'm devastated. It's really hard to say good-bye to love. It's one of the hardest things to do. I can't really put love into words. You know, it's a really strong feeling, and I think, um, that's where ashley and I were headed, and I kind of thought that she did, too. I guess it wasn't as much as I thought it was. I'm definitely upset. You know, this, uh, it sucks. I don't want to be standing here right now, You know, I want to be in there. I came here to find love, and, uh, I didn't. I can't believe it ended this way. Uh, it's not what I expected, and, uh, it hurts. I think she's missing out on a perfect husband. I really do. I think there's somebody out there for me. I don't know when I'll meet her or, um, if I ever will, but, um, you know, hopefully I do. So it's always really hard to say good-bye to somebody, but looking around, I'm so happy with who's here, and hopefully you'll bear with me on the nights That are a little bit harder just because, You know, you do have to say good-bye to somebody, but, um, The good news is We are all moving forward on this journey together To one of the most famous cities in the world. Guys, we're going to hong kong. Men : yeah! Cheers to that. Men : cheers. (clink) next week on the bachelorette"... Ashley : I love hong kong. It is one of my favorite cities That I've ever been to, but I am so scared That I'm never gonna be able to get over this bentley thing. (knock on door) I have been trying to put my best foot forward... Can I come in? What are you doing here? I came to see you. But I'm having a really hard time completely forgetting About bentley. He's in this hotel... Shut up. Right now. Something's telling my brain, like, this guy is the one. Are you serious? This feeling happens so rarely that I-I can't let it go. I have to pursue it. I can't believe this. Hi. Hi. How are you? Good. How are you doing? Good. There's something that I do have to tell you guys. Bentley's in hong kong. (mickey) the mood in the room completely changed. (blake) to hear that I'm competing with eight other guys Instead of seven is not welcome news to me. I mean, I don't want to play second fiddle to anyone. (Lucas) she's wasting my (bleep) time. I'm done. Obviously, you--you lied to us. Ashley : what have I done? That didn't sit well with me at all. Man : you put every (bleep) minute into her, and then this happens. I just don't see what the hell you see in that guy. I'm sorry. It's not easy, and it's only gonna get worse. Ashley : I never knew it was gonna be this hard. It's all coming up next week on... ? We've been stuck in this house for... Quite some time. No signs of life outside of the compound. All we have is some of the same chords played over and over. ? I hope somebody gets this. ? This is the music that I am going to die to. ? llsling
