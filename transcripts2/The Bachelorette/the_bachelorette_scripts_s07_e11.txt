 Tonight on the dramatic season finale of... 
 It's the moment we've all been waiting for... (filtered voice) incredible. (filtered voice) beautiful! This is incredible. Ashley : everything that I've been dreaming about is about to come true. I hate being apart from you. I gotta be honest. (ashley laughs) (ashle I'm ready to be engaged. When ashley faces The biggest decision of her life. Ashley : I don't know what's gonna happen, Choosing between these two amazing guys. I don't think I can envision anything much harder than this. Who will she choose? I never expected this... In a million years? In a million years. I am in love with you. Ben... This is pretty awesome. Pretty rad. (ben) this is the best feeling That I've had about a woman... Ever. Mmm! Or J.P.? I am madly in love with you. I think we're a perfect, perfect fit. (J.P.) today's probably the biggest day of my life. Try not to break my heart. But will he propose? Ashley : I feel so happy I found love. I just hope that he feels the same way that I do. (ben) it's been years since I-I've felt this way. I've never come even remotely close to proposing before. And I guess when you know, you know. This is a feeling that's not all that familiar for me. (J.P.) the unknown kills me. Putting myself out there, taking a leap of faith To end up with a broken heart... Just seems all wrong. It's all coming up right now On the unforgettable season finale of... â™ª Ashley : I'm continuing my journey Through the breathtaking islands of fiji, That I always dreamed of. I don't want to leave here Wishing I did something or said something different. I'm leaving here with no regrets. I'm ready to walk away with my husband. There have been so many surprises and so many devastating moments, but I'm so happy that everything happened, 'cause it's led me to right here. I've never felt better than I do right now. I feel so confident in my feelings for these two guys and I'm so excited to get engaged in the south pacific. I have such an incncdibly difficult decision to make, Choosing between these two amazing guys, T I think fiji is the perfect place To write the last chapter of my love story. Ben is such a unique guy. Every time I'm with him, I am always so happy. And there's somethinabout being around him That makes me feel so c cfortable and it's-- it's really effortless. But on the other hand, I ha this passion with J.P. That I've never felt before.E. This week is a huge week. The guys are both gonna be meeng my faly. And this is the most intense decision That I've ever had in my life, and I'm so grateful That my family has flown all the way here To help me make this decision. (laurie) if the person is there, she'llllnow. And if he's not, I think she'll know that, too. Oh, there she is. Aah! (mike laughs) (eliot) whoo! (laurie laughs) (high-pitched screaming) How are you? Ashley : my family's approval is really important. I'm closest to my mother, but I have to say That I trust my sister's advice a lot more. God, I love my family. (laughter) (chrystie) well, we love you, too. We missed you. Ashley : you know, I wanna be cerin with my decision, and I think it's important to let my family know What's going on so they can help me Figure out the answers to the tough questions, Because I still have to figure this out. We wanna hear all about your adventure. Okay, okay. Guys... Like, what is going on? Okay, first of all... Yeah. It's been awesome. The two guys are J.P. And ben, and today you're gonna be meeting J.P. When we're together, it's like there's nothing else. Like, I have this burning passion. I look at him and I think, like, nothing else matters. The other guy, ben, Is fun, outgoing, just like me. Likekegoofy. Like, jokes around, but can be very serious. Like, is very successful. Both very, very different guys. Mm. So, like, my struggle is, Okay, do I go with exactly what I'm feeling? Even though it's, you know, it's not in your head. He's, like, it might seem like we're very different. Yeah. Or do I go with somebody that I think Maybe it could progress to that level of passion, but we're much more compatible? It's gonna be hard to figure it out. Do you know how these two feel about you? From what I understand, They both feel the same way that I feel about them. Yeah, but are you in love? Are you in love? Yes. (laurie) what? You're in love? Yes. I cannot b bieve it. Oh, no, I-I believe it. You're kid--oh. I believe it 'cause I told her before she left, She'll find him. You think you're ready to get engaged to one of these guys? Yes. And I think at the end of the day what't'kept me strong is knowing that I'm gonna get to that point... Mm-hmm. And I'm so happy that I'm there. (laurie) but do you have your mind made up? I thought I did, but I don't. I'm seriously having a hard time 'cause they're both so great. Well, we're anxious to see you with the guys. See? That's-- because I think-- Well, we feel like we're gonna be able to figure it out. Mm. Yeah, we'll be ablblto tell. We'll be able to tell. (chrystie) I think so, right away. Ashley : mm-hmm. We're gonna see you with the guys, and we're either gonna see the ashley that we know... Yeah. Or an ashley who's a little bit different around someone. I'm a little more concerned this time than I was last time. Well--well-- I'll say that. I just wanna make sure that you're truly in love. But I do hope I like them. Because if I don't like them... (laurie) mm. Then something's up. Something's wrong. Yeah. So we'll get to the bottom of that. We will get to the bottom of that. Coming up... At first glance, seeing you together, I don't see it. I was totally not expecting that. (chuckles) (J.P.) she doesn't even know me. So just to say you don't feel it, it's (bleep). I don't think he's the one. Why are you crying? (crying) because I didn't think you wouldn't like him. (J.P.) to come so far Only to haveveomething like this potentially blow it up, I'm mad. You're saying everything that's in my head, and, like, I'm trying t tfigure it out, but you just come across like you're being such a bitch. (J.P.) if today changes her mind about me, Then I'm definitely not proposing. I am anxious and I'm nervous. I-I'm about to meet ashley's family for the first time, and it's a little nerve-racking. With ashley comes her family, and these are, potentially, People that I will have around me for the rest of my life, and I wanna make a good impression. Hi! Hey! How are you? (J.P.) I'm just gonna continue to be me, and they'll see ashley and me together and how happy we are and how happy we make each other. And I think that, uh, That'll get things started off on the right foot. You look gorgeous. Oh, my god! You're so clean-cut right now! Meeting the parents. Meeting the brother and sist I know. I know. Oh, my god. I need another kiss. I already know how I feel about her, and today is really thlast piece of the puzzle. Ready? Let's go. Yep. Let's go. The proposal's right around the corner. I mean, today is--is huge. Hi! (ashleleand J.P.) ooh-la! (laughs) ooh-la! Be gentle. (laughter) Ashley : today I'm introducing J.P. To my family, and I so excited. Ve been waiting for this day for so long. This is my stepfather mike. This is J.P. How you doing? J.P. Ashley : J.P. Is gonna be meeting my stepfather mike, My mother laurie, my sister chrystie, and my brother eliot. I mean, I-I'm not nervous at all. My family's gonna love J.P. So nice to finally meet all of you. Very nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you, too. You look like a nice gentleman. I hope I live up to it. (laughter) Goodness. So tell us how it's been so far. Yeah. It's been wild, absolutely wild. I was so skeptical with--with everything. And, you know, how can people fall in love this s y? Yeah. And then--I think it was our first one-on-one date. Ashley : mm-hmm. It went perfect. It really did. And I walked out of there just completely blown away By--by ashley and just in my now belief in all of this. And since then, it just keeps gettin' better and better. Ashley : wow. (laurie) so what did your family think of ashley? Oh, they adored her. I knew they would. Did they? I never bring girls home ever. And we're a lot alike, me and my family, So I knew thhey would get along with her. I knew that they would love her. And everything that I told them, they could see it. I mean, they knew how happy I was. My--my mom said--she's like, "I haven't seen you like this in--in five years." Wow. She said, "youre just glowing. You're just incredibly, incredibly happy." And my brother kept asking me, you know, "is this all real?" And I said, uh, "this is 100% real." And today was the last piece of the puzzle, actually. Wow. We better meet... (laughter) Yeah. I didn't even think about turning this around and putting it on you guys. (chrystie) yeah, right? Ashley : I was so proud totoring J.P. Over to my family. They were excited and hay and fun and... Not--not skeptical, you know. Very open and trusting of both J.P. And me. (laurie) all right, I'd like to propose a toast. Whoa! To ashley and, uh, J.P.-- It was great meeting you Thank you. (gasps) wow! (mike) already? Okay. Cheers! Cheers. (clinking) Welcome! (laughs) (chrystie) cheers! Cheers, mom. All right, J.P., So are you ready for the tough questions now? Bring it on. We've all been smiling. My mom was weomed you to the famimi. I mean, the rest should be easy. (laughter) So, J.P... Yes? Ashley's smitten. Are you smitten? Completely. (laurie) wow. Yeah. I have been for a while. Does that answer? Yeah? (chrystie) yeah. No, that's good. Diplomatic answer. Yeah. Um, does J.P. Make you laugh, ashley? Like, is-- do I? I think I make myself laugh. (laughter) Kinda like now? Yeah. (laughs) He's a little bit more reserved than I am, I think. And... Do you make me laugh? What does it say for me if you can't answer that right away? (mike) yeah, really. Ashley : I know. That's not very good. I think I'm funnier than you. That wasn't the question. I think--I think it should be. Now let's not... (speaks indistinctly) (laughter) (laurie speaks indistinctly) The reason I asked if you made her laugh is 'cause we like to have a lot of fun as a family. Can--can you ask her again, though? Does he make you laugh? So much. (laughter) Ashley : t's going so well. I don't think anyone in my family is intimidating. Everne's really welcoming. And I don't think there's anything that J.P. Could do That they would feel... Like he wasn't right for me. ♪ So what's going on here? I don't think he's the one. Why? I don't think so. Why?! I think he's a great guy, but, like... Mnh-mnh. Just the way that you are with him, I don't think-- I-I'm not seeing it. What do you mean? I don't see what you're saying. I mean, I think she's okay with him. Maybe not overly, like she was with--with brad. And it's, like, a little bit more serious now... Yeah. Because with brad, it was, like... You know, I feel really strongly and I'm excited to see my family, but I don't know ithis is really gonna happen. But with him, like, I feel like this is serious. I feel like the defining question was, like, "does he make you laugh?" And you're like, "I laugh at myself." It's like, if you felt that for him, You would've been like, "yes!" It wouldn't ve been a question. I think what worries me is I think you're too much for him. What do you mean? I think you're too young, and he's just kind of a little r and a little bit more demure, and I feel like you're a bit too much for him. Why are you crying? (voice breaks) because I didn't think you wouldn't like him. Why does that upset you? It's heartbreaking because, like... I really, really care about him. But you understand, we're about to msomeone else, too, and we don't know where you're at either way. Mm-hmm. And maybe tomorrow, when I meet the other guy, I'll be like, oh, wait. Hold on. I was wrong because this is a-- No, you won't. No, you won't. You'll think that he's better for me. Like, I do-- why does that upset you, though? The first thing you say walking in here is, like, "oh, he's not for you." I don't think he is. And... I don't think he is. But you haven't even talked to him yet. I saw how you were together. And I--honestly, I don't. I'm--I'm missing something. And here's the difference tween you and I. I'm much more rational. Yeah. You go based off how you feel, and I'm looking at logistics. I'm looking for you for cues. I didn't get those cues. And that just crushes a lot of things for me. Not to say that you're the end-all opinion, but I think I value your opinion. I guess it's just hard because, like, the past week I've been having second thoughts about everything. And, like, and I hoped that today would be, like, Prov--provide me some clarity. (laurie) why were you having-- Why--why were you having second thoughts? Well, it still can. 'cause I'm going between my heart and my head. Follow your heart. See, but it's not that easy. I'm just, like, disappointed. And I'm, like... My heart's a little broken, that's all. Your heart's broken because I didn't... Yes. 'cause I'm not seeing it? (crying) I feel like I've been so alone on this journey. And to finally get that opinion. (sobs) I-I feel that an opinion ke that can't be determined In the ten minutes we were with him. You need more time to-- I'm--I'm talking--no. I'm not saying that you guys don't love him. Like, I'm not saying that. Like, I know we're very different. I know that. But I'm--I'm not saying anything bad about him. No, I know, but, I mean, you had a strong opinion... After meeting him for 15 minutes. My time here is very limited with ashley, and I'm gonna a ll her how I feel. Yes, I--but I think we should wait, After we've spoken to him also. I guess I just hoped that things would've gone differently. I just wanna feel confident in how I feel, and, like, I hoped that this would get me there. And now I'm even more confused. That's why it's hard for me, 'cause nobody can understand. And more than anythingnglike, I want people's support. I don't know what to do. ♪ Oh, chryssie just, like, really made me cry. Why? She's like--the first thing she said when we sat down, She's like, "I think he's not the one for you. Trust me." You know? (cries) What?! And like, it--it hurt me Because I think I have, like, really high hopes for us... (sighs) 'cause I really, like, feel so strongly about him. And, you know, she didn't even sit down and talk to him. She didn't even talk him yet? I didn't need you guys to say, "oh, yeah, he's absolutely the one for you." I just needed something good So I can feel like what I'm feeling is real. And with her saying that, it's like I feel Like I don't know what I'm gonna do. It makes you-- Ah, it confuses you more than anything. It confuses me more. But, like I said, she hasn't even sat down and talked to him. Ashley :y)y sister based a lot Of what she feels about me and J.P. On how I was when he was around. And this is not a good time to be judging, uh, based on me 'cause inside I'm kind of a wreck right now. Hey, J.P. You ready for this? I am. Let's do it. I'm hopeful that after my sister actually sits down and talks to J.P. That she'll change her mind. Well, J.P... Yeah? I was a little bit tough on ashley. How so? I'm skeptical of, I think, your relationship together, Which is not common for me. Usually I trust ashley's opinion. But at first glance and seeing you together, I don't see it. I was totally not expecting that. (chuckles) Neither was I. The first thing that chryssie said when I sat down with her Was, "he's not the one for you." it broke my heart. Broke your heart. But don't stop yourself at that, though. This is you, ash, okay. Yeah. This is your life. Go with what you feel. That's all. Yeah. She hadn't talked to him, and that's not right. I mean, you don't judge anybody when you don't know them. Usually I trust ashley's opinion, but at first glance and seeing you togethereri don't see it. I was totally not expecting that. (chuckles) Neither was I. Was there something that stood out that... Yeah. I think it's when I asked her if you made her laugh. It wasn't like, "yes!" I was actually shocked to hear that also.O. Maybe it's nerves. I don't know what it is. I-I can't answer for her. I don't know why she said that. But there's a lot more to our relationship, so... Well, what is it? Like, what is it about ashley That you honestly see a long-term future with her, So much so that you could propose to her in a couple days? Yeah. Every time I'm around ashley, I'm smiling ear to ear. Like, she always says, "you smile so much," And itit a reflection of her. I wanted all of you to walk away from this... Right. Knowing that I am 100% in love with her. Like, I waed all of you to know that When we walked away from this. Mm-hmm. Because how can you feel good about us If you don't think that I really love her? Right. And I really do. There's a chemistry that's just undeniable when we're together. I-I can't explain it in words. Let me be completely frank. Yeah. You're older--you're much older than her--and so in my head, I think, why hasn't he found anyone yet? Yeah. And what does he want with my much younger sister? I have very limited time, and I need to help my sister make this decision. Right. You know what I mean? I worry that... You're a little too serious for her. I-I think she might be too much for you. In-- really. I've--I mean, I haven't... I don't think she's too much for me to handle. I look at you and I wonder, Someone whs sort of been on his own for a while, Sort of set in a routine... I'm not set in my ways. I I an, I know it's all about compromise. And yeah, I have a lifestyle in new york. Mm-hmm. But I'm willing to change it. Especially when you're in love, All that goes away. I mean, I don't-- It should go away. It should. It should, and it--and it-- But it doesn't always last. It has with me. You do it when you're in that honeymoon phase, but... Mm. I know, yes, I'm set in my ways now, but... That's not how I want it to be. It really isn't. I do love her and I do wanna be with her. And to sacrifice-- And you think ashley is that person... Yeah, I do. Out of everyone you've ever met? Yeah. I do. (chuckles) I'm still struggling with whether, you know... (chuckles) whether it just makes sense altogether, Because I know what she's like Whenenhe's being herself and when she's completely happy. And, you know, and just... I don't know. I don't know. I'm still confused. You think she wasn't being herself back therere I think I expected more. I think I expected to see more of a, like, connection, and I didn't see it. Well, I mean, Has she brought a lot of guys home to meet the family? I told her. I said, "I felt like I saw more of you When you brought brad home." So you're saying, if I propose, you're not happy about it? Obviously, your acceptance, it means a lot. Right. You know, and I wanna know how you're feeling. Um... And you're--whether you think it does or doesn't, You're gonna influence her. I know. I-- you know? I realize that ashley islookingt and for our feedback. Yeah. Given our limited time, it's-- Now it's extremely difficult for me to... Yeah, I gotta turn this around quickly. Otherwise you're gonna go back and-- I don't-- I don't know if it's anything you could turn around though. (J.P.) I kinda figured that the older sister Would have some harsh questions to ask of me, but that wasn't a question. That was a statement About whwh she felt in her gut after 15 minutes. Talk about judging somebody. She doesn't even know me. So just to say you don't feel it, It's (bleep). (scoffs) To come so far Only to have something like this potentially blow it up... I'm mad. Like, I... This is something amazing that she could've totally ruined. And the worst part is that it's her sister and it's gonna influence how ashley feels. Ashley : are you okay? (J.P.) I'm all right. Brutal. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, my family loves you. My sister's just like... I don't know what my sister... It's... (sighs) It's like it wasn't fair. There was just nothing I could do about it. I just felt so, like, defeated. Like, what can I say in the next hour to change your mind? And she said there was nothing. Mm-hmm. I said, "so then what am I gonna do?" I'm afraid it's gonna affect you and change the way you think or it's not. Is it gonna affect you? No. I told you, the only thing that bothers me is that it's gonna change the way you feel. Or the way I think you feel. I don't want you to feel that. And the worst part was-- you wanna know the worst part? Mm? That she saw more with brad. It stung. I mean, I'm not saying everybody's gonna love me, but the thing that I'm thinking about the most is, It's gonna affect ashley. She's gonna walk away from this. "what did I miss that my sister-- You know, so clear cut? I just don't see it." mm-hmm. (sighs) (sighs) I mean, and I am easily influenced by my family, I think. I am. I'm not gonna lie. I do need, like, the approval of other people. Like, I think that's'sow I am in life. But I think I just need to figure it out. Kinda thought you had it figured out. My family's opinions weigh heavily into my decision Because I care about the people that are in my life and I trust them. So to have my sister say That she doesn't think J.P.'s the one for me, It left me feeling more confused than ever. I don't want you to go home and, like, worry about this... (stifles laugh) and think about it for the next day. Of course I'm gonna worry about it. We won't have a chance to move forward Until the next time I see you. Mm-hmm. So between now and then, it's all I'm gonna think about. (J.P.) I don't want to say good-bye today, Especially when things are unresolved. I was expecting a little more out of her. I was expecting her to... Say right away, you know, "my sister just doesn't get it. "like, I'm crazy about you. She just hasn't had enough time to see us." There was a little bit of that, but not as much as I would've liked. We'll talk more soon. Yep. She's gotta know that I'm flustered and that I'm upset. I wanted her to backt up. I wanted her to say, "don't worry. I'm not gonna let that affect how I feel about us." That's what I wanted to hear, and I didn't hear it. And now I'm just questioning what she feels. And now that there's only a date and then a proposal left In this entire journey,  To have her question things now... It couldn'n'be worse timing. I am in love with ashley, and nothing can change that. But I don't want to be with someone Who's unsure if they wanna be with me. So if today changes her mind about me, Then I'm definitely not proposing. Ashley : yesterday, I cannot believe That my sister said straight up to J.P., "you know, I don't think you're the one for her." I thought it was just harsh and uncalled for and it's way premature. And today, ben is gonna be meeting my family, and I'm so scared That my sister is going to flat-out say something To potentially ruin our relationship. Ben is on his way over for our date, and I don't know what's gonna happen. So I need to talk to my sister Because I care about ben so much. If that were to happen again, I'm scared I'm gonna leave here alone. You know, with J.P., like bringing him here, I was really nervous. I wanted you guys to like him so bad 'cause of what I did feel for him. And I think maybe that came across as, le, Discomfort, I guess. You want me to like him, and that's your issue. And the fact that I'm not sure about it, You are instantly on the defense. And you're--you're sitting here, trying to convince me, and I don't want to be convinced. I personally am a much more rational person. I'm coming from a much more, like, "is thth really gonna work out?" rsus, like, that gut feeling? You know what I mean? I think that gut feeling can fade. Well, look at thisis Look at how you felt about the person who left. You had that immediate gut... Yeah. And that turned out to not be right. Oh, and that's--and that's what I'm missing? That turned out not to be right. And I feel like I gave J.P. An opportunity, but there were just... Several key questions and-- He was already defeated, I feel. And he told me... (speaks indistinctly) "when I was sitting there with your sister," He was like, "she's asking ese questions, and I can't even think straight." He's like, "the only thing that's going on in my head is, Like, she doesn't approve of me. She doesn't approve of me." But it has nothing to do with him. You know that, right? I know, but he--I'm just saying, in the moment, like, He just felt like a failure. Like there was nothing-- There was nothing he could say, and I told him that. But it's nothing to do with him. It's just like... But you can see how that's a little harsh. That's what bothered me. Am I here to sugarcoat it? I mean, I don't get it. No, but you-- like, I had to be true to how I'm feeling... I apprec-- and I'm not feeling it. I have to say something 'cause you thought with brad, I was myself. And the truth is, if you think that I was better with brad because I was, like, uhh! Oh, I'm not-- and you're judging a relationship on that... I'm not saying that you would be better with him. But I'm saying you were much more yourself. You're--then we're in a different world, 'cause what I feel with both of these guys is so different. I really wanted you guys to like J.P.,, and, like, I came in here-- like, I'm gonna cry again. Stop. It pisses me off because you're saying everything That's in my head... Okay. And, like, I know all of these things. Then what-- And I'm trying to figure it out, but you just come across like you're being such a bitch. Like, you're just, like, so tough and so badass. It's like, why can't you feel for me for a second? It's like you're telling me all these things I know, and I feel alone once again. I'm not telling you what yowanna hear. I don't want you to tell me what I wanna hear. Yes, you absolutely wt me to tell you w-- This is what I want you to say, chrys. I want you to look at me and say, "you know, ashley, this is not gonna be easy. "like, I know. Like, you have two great guys, and I know you feel this way, but I think this." Isn't that what I'm saying? But instead I feel like there'ss a wall between us,  And you're talking at me, and I feel so alone. And after all of this, Feeling so alone is not what I wanna feel right now. It's like, I don't feel like I have a sister right now. I feel like-- because you want me to just tell you what you wanna hear. You don't wanna hear what I have to say... No. That's not true, chrys. 'cause I'm telling you what I have to say, and you don't want to hear it. You wanna hear that I love J.P. And I think you guys should be together. That's what you-- no. But if I said it, you wouldn't be crying right now. No, chryssie, I want you to be honest... Okay. And I always said I wanted you to be honest, and if that's the way that you feel, I want you to say that. But you're, like, against me, and, like, It makes me wanna put a, like, a defense up. And that's why I feel like I have to be so defensive of J.P. Because I feel like you're attacking me. But I don't feel like I wanna baby you. You're an adult. And you're just, like, going with your emotions. And I'm trying to protect you from yourself. Ashley : my conversation with my sister Did not go the way I planned at all. I don't feel like she's looking out for me. It almost felt like There was just some negative thing going on with her, and that sucks for me 'cause she's the one person I really was trusting. I'm pretty devastated. ♪ (laurie) what happened? I mean... (chrystie sighs) (voice breaks) she is (bleep) mad at me, saying, "don't you think I'm already thinking of these things?" Oh, I'm s-- "all you're doing is being negative and saying everything I'm already thinking." And she's mad at me. She said, "you're being distant." And it's like, "because I'm not in it." I'm, like, an outside, rational person. Well, you're her big sister. She wants you to approve. I know, but she has her mother, her stepfather, and her brother All cheering her on. But you're her sister. I mean, you know she wants your-- She wants your approval, too. She--she wants my approval. She doesn't want my opinion. She only wants my opinion if it, you know, Corresponds with the way she's feeling. It doesn't make sense to just, like, Go with every gut reaction that you have, Fall in love, fall in-- you know what I mean? She's gonna learn. (sighs) I mean... (sniffles) And who knows? She had a gut feeling for another guy, and it didn't work out. They brought him back, and that was closure for her. I know, but, like... He--she probably liked his-- He left on his own accord. Yeah, well, she found out why he left. Evidently, he didn't have the feelings for her 'cause he would've stayed. I don't care-- But--but I'm just saying, her gut reaction was, "this is the guy." yeah, but it wasn't meant to be. And now her gut reaction says something else. She's been wrong before, is what I'm saying. Ben! Whwh's up? Hi. (laughs) are you hot? Little bit. Ashley : the conversation with my sister Kinda threw me for a loop. How are ya? Good. How are you? (kisses) mmm. Good to see you. You, too. I'm just so worried that my sister was Gonna approach meeting ben The same way she approached meeting J.P. Am I gonna be able to do that all day or... I don't know. We'll see. Yeah. Probably not around your brother. No, my brother's easy. Really? My sister might come... Really? I think--yeah. All right. What do you think? Let's go meet the fam. Let's go! All I could think about was how scared I was, Because this truth is, I could be with ben. Like, ben could be my guy. Hi! Ben! Hi, everybody! (chuckles) Ashley : I'm nervous to find out what my sister says about ben... Hi. Ben. Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm laurie. Nice to meet you. Hi, laurie. Nice to meet you. And I'm nervous how I'm gonna deal with it. Getting to know this one has been great. (laughs) Once I settle in a little bit... (laurie) okay. You'll see how-- how we interact. But... So what was your first date like? We sort of noticed each other on the--the group date... Oh, the orphanage. And--yeah, the orphanage. That was kinda where it started for me... Mm. With you. I'd finally come, and I think she finally saw that, too. Mm-hmm. So that was the start of it. And our first date in chiang mai. That was another turning point. Every kind of step of the way, Every one-on-one date we've had... Yeah. Has just kind of escalated more and more. Mm-hmm. So... So how-- so now I'm here meeting the family. (laughs) Which is crazy to meet with. (laughter) very nice to meet you all. Same here. How was your hometown date? Went really well, I thought. Ben is so goofy and, like... Crazy like I am. I thought his family was gonna be a lot like you guys, and I walked in and it was not expected but it was good. I mean, it was good. Yeah, my mom's like martha stewart. Like, the wine. My mom and my sister go into the city, and they have tea and things l le that. But they did like her. They liked her very much. And so from there, I was kinda like, oh, I got this. You know, that's kind of like how I've felt since then. I'm just kind of trusting my gut and going with it. Um-- what do you think? Is this what you expected? (laughs) Come on in! Come on! Come on! Let's have a party! (laughter) I don't know what that means. (laughter) It means that I'm looking for, um... (laurie) connection. For a connection, but I also wanna see ashley be herself Around whoever she brings. So-- Like that just now? Party and dancing and, you know, dog voice. How do you know me? All right, you ready? For what? (high-pitched whining) oh, that. (laughter) ormal voice) do it. Come on, do it. Already? Dog. Come on. No, I just met these people. (baby talk in high-pitched voice) (laurie) do you have a pet? Is that why... Yeah, I have a little--I have a little jack russell terrier. Okay. His name's scotch. (laurie) so you guys have talked about boo, her dog, and... Uh-huh. Boo and scotch-- there's a lot-- I mean, there's a lot of embarrassing moments, you know. With you guys talking puppy talk back and forth? Yeah, dog voice. A lot of dog voice talk. His is better than mine. It's not that good. Oh, it's so good. Oh! Come on. You can do it. Come on. Let's pretend like I'm scotch. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just do it full-out. (gruff voice) scotchie. (laughs) (baby talk in gruff voice) (laughter) (applause) (normal voice) that's pretty much it. Oh, my goodness! (ben) it's a lot of that and it's like... Okay, and, ashley, now you do yours. It's so bad. (ashley speaking baby talk in high-pitched voice) Yeah. (laurie laughing) Oh, my goodness. The two of you-- Living next door to the two of you would be like... (mike) oh, my goodness. (baby talk in gruff voice) (normal voice) oh, I'm sitting back down. (laurie) oh, that's cute. That was cute. (mike) it's pretty good. (ben) yeah. Yay! Ashley : I think my famimi knows how I feel, and they can see that I'm smitten. Everything about ben is really perfect in my eyes, and I think that my family got a good sense of that. But I'm scared My sister is going to ask some tough questions.. She's my big sister ananshe's concerned for me, but J.P.'s meeting with my sister was not easy, and that kind of scares me a little bit. So, benny benny boo... Yep. I'm gonna have some tough questions for you. I heard that you might. (shoes clatter) I love ashley, and so I think it's my job as her older sister To be a little bit protective... Mm-hmm. And just make sure That she's making the right decision and the person that she's falling in love with is also in love withther, Because I don't want her to get heartbroken. I know. I have... Really taken everything into consideration. I mean, months now... Right. Right. Where I just am like, "am I doing the right thing?" And I keep coming back to the conclusion That yes, this is right and I'm doing the right thing. It just feels right. It just feels right. I wasn't gonna do a lot of talking today. You would just kind of see how natural it was. I see ashley being... Herself, which is refreshing. That's exactly what I wanted to see coming in today, Is just she's being fun and excitable and funny... Mm-hmm. And she's looking at you In a way that makes me know that she likes you. Right. And I-I can honestly say that I iave seen that today. Good. I'm glad. So that's--that's good. (laughs) that's good to know. Um, so tell me what it is about ashley... That you are just like, "yes, this is the woman I want to be with." Or you know what? Is she even the woman you wanna be with? Yeah, I-I wouldn't be here If she wasn't the woman I wanted to be with. There's been moments... Mm-hmm. Where I've felt like this with other women in the past. But this has been very different. So what is it about this time that makes perfect sense for you To get yourself into a long-term relationship and possibly be engaged? I finally knew that I loved your sistst. You're in love with her? I'm in love with your sister. Won--like, without a doubt you're in love? Without a doubt. Without a doubt. Okay. I figured it out on our last date Where--like we were in there, like we were best friends. Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? Right. But there's much more than just best friends. Do you think that she's in love with you? Uh, I would like to think so. Yes. I hope so. What is it that you see in-- like, when she's with you, Do you see some sort of sparkle in her-- yeah. Like, what does she do To let you know that she is in love with you? That last date that we had, just the... Where the laughter was coming from... Mm-hmm. That sheer amount of j j and laughter... Right. And it was just so natural and unforced. The end of that date is when I really knew. But are you ready to propose to her? I am ready to propose to her. We're at the right age. We're at the right time in our careers. Mm-hmm. We're just-- Everything's just kind of aligned. And it's been a really, really natural, easy progression This entire time. I've not forced anything. I haven't said anything that I haven't wanted to say. Right. Uh, I haven't--I havav't even told her that I loved her yet, but I think that she probably knows. You guys seem to have a really upbeat, positive energy. I just--I worry about whether you can maintain that long-term. I've been married and I've been divorced, and it's the last thing I want for ashley. So I want her to find someone who has all the pieces... You know... That she's looking for. Yeah. And you think that's you? I've got it all. (laughs) (laughs) oh, yeah. I... (singsongy) ballsy! For those--for those, yeah. I mean, you have to maintain a good amount of... Confidence. Right. Confidence throughout this whole thing, Otherwise it eats ya up. I appreciated ben's sort of open honesty. (sighs) can I get your chair for you? I thought he was handsome, tall, dark. I could see that ashley was, what I felt, herself around him. Perfect. (laughter) That's what I was really looking for, and ashley was absolutely right In thinking that we were gonna like him. You're a big dude. I mean, it's weird-- (laughter) It's weird how, you know, like, big dudes like small dogs. What I see in ben and ashley is actually a shared passion. You know, that connection is there, and so I think ashley would have Anything but a dull life with ben. It went really well, I thought. Everyone loves you. Oh, yeah? (laughter) You know, ben definitely brings out a goofy side in me. Definitely. ...Gonna say good-bye. Everyone, say good-bye... Ashley. To ben. But more than anything, I think my family can see What I was raving about now. You want a hug? Here. Give me a hug. Ashley : successful. Great guy. Funny. (laurie) smooches. Oh, you want me to... (laughter) nice. I think my family loved ben, and I think they thought he was perfect for me. Your sister grilled me a little bit. Did she? What'd she ask you? Everything and anything. Do you think it went well? I do. I think it went well all around. Mm. I've been accepted into the family, and, uh, that's how I kinda know that This is right, and I see us together in the end. I am in love with ashley, and the next time I see all these people, I will be engaged to ashley. Tell your family I loved meeting 'em. Wonderful people. I will. I will. Good people. All right. Bye, buns. Bye. 
 
 Ashley : with ben, I feel like I have everything-- All the love, all the zest for life... (wave splashes) But I just can't forget how I feel about J.P. What we have is something very special, and I think that it could last a lifetimeme If it was my sister's decision, she would pick ben, but the way things went yesterday Made me really question, you know, my sister's opinion, and if I can really value it at all. I was just hoping to get the support of my family, but it left me feeling more confused than ever. I think that I learned today That I have to maybe trust my own feelings, Or try to. Ashley : love you, guys. Bye. Bye, ash. Love you. (laurie) Yeah. See you soon. Ashley : it's been really hard up until now, and it's only gonna be harder When I actually have to say good-bye To somebody that I really care about. ♪ If you'd like to date The next bachelor or bachelorette, Go to bachelor.Abc.Com and click apply."

(ben) typically you'd think there's nothing sexy About mud at all, Until you get into a big mud pit With someone you're extremely attracted to... This is pretty aweweme. Pretty rad. And then the mud becomes very... Sexy. Healing mud. I think the fact that we became friends Before there was, like, a real romance that developed is a big part of this, So we have that, like, playful friends side... I feel like I'm a a d again. But at the same time, When you're lubing each other up with mud, It's really quite... Erotic. I love this date, and the mud bath's really sexy. It's a great place to have a romance. All I wanted to do was rub that mud All over his body, like, ten times. I wish I could reach lower, so I could, like... (laughs) (laughs) I had so much fun with ben in the mud bath today. It was awesome. I feel completely healed. Mmm! (ben) this moment today with ashley-- This is one I'll remember for the rest of my life, So I'm excited for the next part of the date. How do you feel? Healed? Rejuvenated. Rejuvenated? There's so much I want to tell her, but today is not the right time. I kinda want to keep it light still, So I will tell her this evening. I have a good feeling about everything right now. (ben) this is a huge moment for me. She has a decision to make soon here, and I have not told ashley that I love her yet. It just hasn't seemed like the right time.. There have been multiple times where I wanted to tell her, but I think that it's the right thing to do To tell her now, so that she knows Hopefully easier for her. It's a really big deal For me to tell someone that I love them, and I mean it when I say it. I've only done it a few times in my life, but ashley has taken my breath away.

I talked to your parents and your sister About the proposal and everything, and I got their permissi... Wow. Which was big, and it was really, really easy to ask them. Really?

Ashley : yesterday my date with ben-- It was the perfect date, but today is my last date with J.P., and going into it, I have more questions than ever. Hi, japes. (J.P.) hey. My family date-- He had a hard titi with my sister and he was really affected by it. Hi, baby. I cannot believe that my sister said straight up to J.P., "you know, I don't think you're the one for her." I hate being apart from you. I gotta be honest. (laughs) Like, I don't care if it's five minutes or five d-- A rough day to be apart, huh? Yeah. Yeah, it was, uh--we'll talk about it a little bit. My sister's opinion didn't change the way I felt about him, but it just made me step back and really think about the relationship. I think it's good that I am trying to step back and really be sure that this relationship makes sense Beyond the attraction and the passion. I want to be sure that I can see a life with J.P. I think that's my main mission today. What's up? That was rough. I want to hear it all. Every part of the date Went great... Mm-hmm. Except for the obvious one with your sister, and it just kinda left a scar on all of it. Mm-hmm. I don't understand how she could judge us Just based upon, like, 15 minutes of seeing us together. I know. She didn't even give it a chance, but why would she do that? I mean, your sister really screwed me up... Mm-hmm. And my biggest concern of all of it Was that you would feel differently about us Because of what your sister thinks she saw. It caught me off guard with my sister, and it's made me question, but I think any good relationship Has to be questioned. What I see when I see our relationship Is... We are different, and I guess my sister was seeing that as, "you guys are not, like, meant," you know? With all due respepe to your sister, I disagree with her and I think she was wrong. I think she was wrong for judging us, and I think she was wrong for saying that. Did what my sister say make you think, Make you step back and be like, "wow, maybe I should see if we're right for each other?" Or did-- no, because I know she's wrong. I know she's wrong. For the first time, I felt like I had to defend our relationship, 'cause people don't feel what we feel. I want to be able to say, like, "this is why we work," And I know you and I have-- We've never had to explain it or defend it. I mean, I-I've never thought about trying to explain us To anybody. It just works, and it's not like You sacrifice being you around me, 'cause you don't. I want to be in a-a dynamic relationship, Like, a relationship that never stops moving, and, like, we always keep learning and loving, and that's what I want. I--that's what we have. I think we're a perfect, perfect fit. Well, can I tell you, like-- The reason I'm asking you these questions is not to attack you. It's because I care about you so much, and I'm just thinking about, like, the reality, You know, of us. And you should. I-I mean, I've been thinking about that for a while. Mm-hmm. I want to know what you're worried about... Mm-hmm. And I want to-- I mean, I want to be there To--to help you through it. When it comes to you... Mm-hmm. I'm flexible on everything. I mean, I'm not asking you to come to new york and just get sucked into this monotonous relationship. That's not what I want, either. Mm-hmm. I mean, you have to keep the fire going, you know. You've gotta do new things. Right. You--and I... It's--that's what I want. You're willing to, like, start a life with me and not just, like, have me fit into yours? Is that a stupid question? What do you-- what do you think? I guess I wanted you to say that, you know? Oh, and I thought I had been saying that. I know you-- yeah, I want us to start a new life together. Mm-hmm. I'm at a point in my life Where I'm willing, you know, to--to give up a lot, and it's--and it's not because I have to. It's because I want to. Mm-hmm. It's because I want you to be happy, and when you're happy, I'm happy. (J.P.) I'm not 100% sure what ashley feels. I don't think I can be. She needs to know exactly how I feel and what's going on in my mind, Because the next time I see her, It's a proposal, and if she's not sure that I love her or not... Maybe she--the other-- Maybe the other guy said he loved her, So she needs to know what's going on in my mind, and if this is what she needs to hear To really reassure her that I'm the right guy, I'll--I'll take this--this leap of faith. (sighs) Your stepfather gave me a piece of advice. What? I told all of them something that I haven't told you yet... Okay. Because I wanted them to walk away Knowing where my head is, where my heart is. Mm-hmm. And he said, "if I can offer you one piece of advice, "that would be, don't leave anything on the table. If you feel something, tell her how you feel." Mm-hmm. And so I've been going back and forth, Back and forth, back and forth.
