 Can you trust in this? 
 I'm totally on the same page with you. I promise. 
 Ashley : there's something about bentley that's so sincere. 
 I just know that he's my guy. 
 (bentley) I came in thinking That ashley was not attractive at all. I'm not feeling it. 
 I'm not sure how exactly this is gonna go, but there's no turning back. 
 Hi. 
 I'm gonna make ashley cry. 
 I hope my hair looks okay. 
 (laughs) 
 You're leaving? 
 Yeah. 
 (voice breaks) 
 I'm so sad right now. 
 (bentley) things could've turned out differently If the bachelorette was Emily. 
 Even if I'm not coming back, Like, I still wanna keep the dot, dot, dot" there. 
 (whispers) dot, dot, dot. 
 Dot, dot, dot is better than just a period. 
 (ashley, voice breaking) why? Why? Why this? 
 (whispers) I didn't think this would happen to me here. 
 (crying) my heart is, like, totally broken. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 (sobs) 
 Now how can I do this? 
 And tonight... 
 (trumpets) 
 Ashley : we are in phuket, thailand, and it is a tropical paradise. 
 Oh, my god. 
 This is beautiful. 
 I'm trying to put my best foot forward, but I don't know if I can make anyone happy, feeling so hurt. 
 I do think of bentley. 
 I just can't forget about him. 
 Man : this is the perfect place to fall in love. 
 Wow. 
 Man : this is an experience I will take with me forever. 
 (laughs) 
 Ashley : in order for me to find love, I need to let go and be open and have fun and enjoy it, but I really don't know where things are gonna go. 
 (Ryan p.) at some point, the man claws are Gonna come out, and it's gonna get dangerous. 
 I'm gonna steal her for really quick. 
 (lucas) Ryan's getting on some people's nerves. 
 Goober! 
 If there was one person that's grating on almost everyone, You know, it would be you. 
 Really? 
 (Ryan p.) there's definitely jealousy That's starting to float around. 
 So this is the real you? 
 It's all coming up on... 
 ♪ 
 (seagulls cry) 
 Chris Harrison : hey, guys! 
 Come on in the living room! 
 Fellas, good morning. 
 Men : morning. 
 How's it going? 
 Good. 
 I think you realize by now just how serious ashley is about All of this, and I hope everyone sitting in front of me now is just as serious about why we're here. 
 With that said, let's talk about this week. 
 Three dates. There will be two one-on-one dates and a group date. Roses up for grabs on all the dates, and by now you know how this works. 
 You get a rose, you're safe through the next rose ceremony, but on a one-on-one date, if ashley doesn't give you a rose, You'll be going home immediately, So have your bags packed just in case. 
 Now as for the dates and who's going, you'll find out As the date cards arrive, but I don't have one for you today. 
 I talked to ashley, and we both agree, Time for a fresh start. 
 Time to move on, but I don't think we can do that here, So, fellas, get ready to leave this mansion forever. 
 You will continue this journey to find love In the beautiful country of thailand. 
 (cheering) 
 (speaking at once) yes! Yes! 
 Have a seat. There is more. 
 Man : no way! 
 You'll be meeting ashley On the incredible beaches of phuket... 
 Man : oh, wow. 
 Oh, my god. 
 So get ready for the mother of all road trips. 
 Go pack your bags. 
 Wheels up in two hours. Go. 
 I'll see you in thailand. 
 Man : whoo! 
 When Chris harrison announced that we were going to thailand, My heart beat through my chest. 
 (both grunt) 
 Oh, man. I hope I have a one-on-one date in phuket. 
 (west) obviously I'm excited to go to phuket, but I think ashley's upset about bentley leaving, but there's still a bunch of really cool guys in this house, and I hope that she'll be able to see that and be ready to move on with the process. 
 ♪ 
 (trumpets) 
 Ashley : I've never been to thailand. 
 I've never been to anyplace in asia, So I am so excited. 
 This week I'm really feeling like things are looking Really hopeful and promising for me, but I do still feel like I might be holding on a little bit To the beginning of the relationship That I had with bentley, and the truth is, A lot of the times, I do think of bentley. 
 I just kinda close my eyes and think, How would it be if he were here with me? 
 And I know I shouldn't be doing that, but all I know is what I felt in that short period of time. 
 I just can't forget about him. 
 It's obvious that I'm really affected by bentley leaving, So as much as I'm trying to put my best foot forward, I think the guys probably feel neglected, Feel like they don't matter, and if I were in their shoes, I would be upset, So I'm hoping That I can just dig myself out of this hole. 
 Woman : hi. Welcome to renaissance phuket. 
 Ashley : hi. 
 How are you? 
 Thank you. 
 I'm good. How are you? 
 Very good. Thank you. 
 My name is annie. 
 Nice to meet you, annie. 
 I'm ashley. 
 So just tell me, what can I do for you? 
 So I'm trying to plan a few dates. 
 I have 12 guys here. 
 Yeah. Oh, my god. 
 Yeah, and they're hot. 
 (laughs) 
 (laughs) 
 ♪ 
 On our way. 
 I'm hoping that all the things that made ashley sad this week She can leave behind, and I think there's probably No better place to start over than thailand. 
 Just got off an airplane. 
 A long way from home. 
 I want to know the best things to do in thailand. 
 You can take a kayak into the hidden lagoons. 
 It can be romantic. 
 Believe me, ashley. 
 Ooh. That sounds nice. 
 Man : this is us. 
 Man : what? 
 Man : whoo! 
 Man : oh, my god. 
 This is where the party happens. 
 This is incredible, dude. 
 I'm super excited to see ashley in thailand. 
 Hopefully she will forget about everything that's happened In this past week. 
 What've we got in here, buddy boy? 
 Whoo, whoo! 
 (lucas) the villa is amazing. 
 Man : look at this. 
 It's so relaxing. 
 You can open every window. 
 We've got a little outdoor pool. 
 You want the pool or the ocean? 
 Take your pick. 
 This is gonna be a fun adventure for us. 
 Good luck. 
 You really helped me out a lot. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Thank you, ashley. 
 Enjoy phuket. 
 Have a great day. Thank you. 
 Thank you. Bye-bye. 
 Ashley : you know, all along I've been thinking That bentley was the guy that was gonna be there in the end, but now I don't have a guy in mind. 
 Wow. 
 Maybe it'll work better. 
 Look at this. 
 In order for me to find love, I need to let go and be open and have fun and enjoy it. 
 Coming up... 
 So I thought it would be cool If we took a boat out to a private beach. 
 (thunder crashes, wind gusts) 
 Too big wave. 
 You cannot go out. 
 All right. 
 (Ryan p.) there's definitely jealousy That's starting to float around. 
 I'm gonna steal her really quick. 
 (lucas) Ryan's getting on some people's nerves. 
 Goober! 
 If there was one person that's grating on almost everyone, It would be you.

 Man : got a date card here, gentlemen.

(laughs, normal voice) the middle of nowhere. (constantine) you know, bentley leaving--it was an eye-opener. You know, whatever connection they had, it was between them, but I haven't seen her since last week, So best-case scenario-- we go out. We have a blast today. We get to know each other better. I just kinda want to see, you know, where her head's at. So I was thinking, I love being in the water... Yeah. So I thought it would be cool if we took a boat out To a private beach. Are you kidding me right now? Mnh-mnh. I know, I know. Let's do this! Hell, yeah. All right. Let's go. Hi. (speaking thai) Something's up. (wind gusting) This doesn't look very good. When he does this... Yeah. When he does this and this... And then he does this, that makes me feel like... Oh. That's not a good idea. (laughs) Too big wave. You cannot go out. Sorry. (thunder crashes) All right. (sighs) Raining on our day. Listen, we're in thailand. It doesn't matter. Like, seriously, like-- I know. I know. I know. It doesn't matter. (laughs) Yeah, right. (constantine) I think she was a little bummed that we didn't Do what she had planned, but at the same time, I'm in thailand, and I'm here to meet her, and I'm here to get to know her, So we really could be doing anything. It really doesn't matter. And we can we go shop for, like, the ugliest hawaiian, like... (laughs) all right. We'll figure something out. I like this. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Ooh. ♪ Wow. Look how cute! Wow. (chuckles) this is great. This is cute. This is awesome.

Look how cute these are. Do I look cute? These look-- (laughs) that's--that's awesome. I'll tie it around you. Very proper. Very nice. (laughs) Ashley : constantine just goes with the flow. It didn't matter what we were doing, As long as we were just hanging out and spending time together. We're literally as far away from home As we could ever possibly be. That's so crazy. I know. It's a good thing. Oh, it's a dream come true. Look at all this stuff. You know what helps a lot? Like, locals. (chuckles) what do you mean? Like, if you talk to, like-- we're in a crazy-- And we have no clue what's going on. If you talk to locals, You can get--it's the best way to figure stuff out. Talk to this local right here. (chuckles) Hey, man. Hey, how are you? Hi. We should get somebody to maybe translate. Good? Yeah. Um... This-- You don't speak english? Anybody speak english? (women giggle) Hi. Hi. How are you? Will you help us out? Good. Um, what do you want to ask? That's a wedding ring, I'm guessing. How long has he been married? It looks-- (speaks thai) (speaks thai) 36 years. Wow. What's the key? Yeah. Does he have any advice for us? (speaks thai) (speaking thai) Um, you know, the key is to forgive, to forgive and forget, You know, whenever you guys fight about little things. That's good. Ohh. Mm-hmm. (speaks thai) I like it. I want to hear this. He said, um, don't try to win. (gasps) wow. Hey, this is solid advice. Ohh! Did you hear that? I wrote it down. Don't try to win. Don't try to win. Forgive and forget. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. The best thing that the man said to us Was that love is not about winning. If you're gonna get advice about love, It's gonna be from a guy with 37 years of marriage. The win thing was good. The what? The win thing was good. Winning, trust. Don't try to win. I don't want somebody to feel like they're just competing To get to the next date, to get to the next location. I want somebody that's here to look to see If we have something together. That was cute. Yes. I believe that, though. Man : there's no competitive part Of any of you that hopes he doesn't get a rose? (J.P.) I hope he doesn't. 'cause, uh, if someone's gotta go, someone's gotta go. If he doesn't get a rose, more for the rest of us. (knock on door) I am dying to be part of a date this week. I will be extremely disappointed if I come to phuket and stay here all week and don't get to be part of a date. I know that it was so personal to her when bentley left, So it's a little bit frustrating. It's hard to know exactly where I stand. Yeah... Oh! It's a group date, gentlemen. Man : oh. Let's read 'em off. Ben f. Man : mnh! (chuckles) Man : oh! J.P... Blake. Mm. Man : whew. Mickey dawg. West... Ben c... Nick... Lucas... (men chuckle) William... And Ryan.

Make the world a better place quickly... Yeah. So that the next day, my date will be even better. (chuckles) (man laughs) Man : ames! ♪ Ashley : I'm so glad that you're on my date. So you're saying I've got a chance? (laughs) So you're saying I've got a chance? Cheers. Cheers. Ashley, to making the best out of a rainy day. (clink) Exactly. (constantine) this date has gone, so far, really great. Doing something that we totally--that's foreign To both of us is really neat, you know. We're just kinda not taking ourselves too seriously, Just soaking up all this new experience together. You know, we're just having fun with each other and joking, and, uh, rain or shine, I'm just--I'm glad that, you know, I finally get my chance to get to know her better. I love plan b" on the first date. (laughs) Awesome. To be honest with you, like, the most important thing is that we seem to be able to make the best of a situation. Mm-hmm. You know, we just--we're like, you know what? I'm gonna take You downtown, and I'm gonna wear orange shorts, and we're gonna Have a good time. I'm gonna sweat like a beast. (laughs) I'm gonna sweat like a pig, and we're still gonna have A good time, you know what I mean? It's not about winning, and it's, you know, or losing. It has nothing to do with that or-- mm-hmm. You know, preach it up around the world. It's really to be here to see if, you know... There's something. There's something. So cheers to not winning. (laughs) Cheers to not winning. That sounds pretty... (chuckles) cheers to not winning. (chuckles) Ashley : in my mind, phuket was gonna be kind of like A fresh start, but I'm still thinking about bentley, and I still think about bentley when I'm on these dates. Let's go. I mean, the truth is, I was a little bummed out Because our date was rained out, but constantine's really making me feel a lot better. There's definite chemistry between constantine and I, and I feel like I have a little bit of my heart back, So I'm ready to start being able to give it away. Let's just run. You wanna just run? Chill? I don't know if that's such a good idea to-- (laughs) because I can beat you! (constantine) you know, ashley announced it's gonna be A fresh start for everybody. I really hope that's the case. I just right now am enjoying getting to know her and the fact That she's easy to talk to, and I want to know more About her. That means something to me. I'm really happy with how, you know, things have gone so far. The rain tried to keep us from having fun, and we still had fun. I'm excited about Seeing, you know, where it goes from here. Aah! (laughs) (laughs) I'm slowing down. I win, I win, I win! I'm slowing down. Right here, right here, right here. Look at that. Isn't it cute? Oh, wow. It is beautiful. I don't think it gets better than this. Ashley : I'm really looking forward To getting to know constantine a little bit better tonight. Today he made me feel so good, and I know that this could go in a really good direction. I'm hoping that he's not noticing That I'm feeling... A little bit off. (clink) Phenomenal. You have really great taste in dates. Oh, thank you. You know, this is really awesome. Yeah, it's pretty amazing. I'm worried, because part of me wants To tell constantine how I felt about bentley and just how strong and real those feelings were, but I'm also scared. I don't know if I can open up, and I don't know how to handle this. So what did you think of today? Did you have fun? I did. I like how it was just, like, spontaneous. It was cool. Yeah. You know, it was different. Like, we just made the best of it, you know what I mean? It was easy, right? Yeah. It would--I mean, so maybe if we went kayaking, We wouldn't have gotten a chance to talk a little bit... Mm-hmm. And figure out--you know, you would've been too busy, like... Yeah. Teaching you how to kayak? Probably. Teaching me how to kayak. (chuckles) yeah. (chuckles) What do you think about-- like, how did you stay positive In all this? Like, I want to know, because it's, you know, From my--it's, like, tough, you know what I mean? It's hard. Yeah. Well, how did you, like--'cause you said it worked for you. (sighs) how did--yeah. I mean, it's honestly, You have to have strength. Just stay positive and be honest with yourself and be honest with me. Yeah. Yeah. You know, if you're not feeling anything, like, let me know. Yeah. You know what I mean? 'cause I'm here--I'm not here to... I don't just think that everyone likes me. I don't think that everyone wants to be with me. Yeah. Yeah. Like, that's not the case. It's gonna--it's-- that's the tough thing for me. Like, I need to be honest with you and be open with you and because you told me to... Mm-hmm. And, like, the--I am having a good time with you... Uh-huh. And, like, today was really fun. I know it was fun, Because I wasn't doing, like, over-the-top, crazy stuff. Mm-hmm. I was just doing normal, like, day-to-day, like, cool-- You know, but obviously in a special setting With someone very special. Right. But I'm glad it went that way, 'cause it was easier for me To separate the excitement of the day from, like, The excitement of the situation, you know what I mean? Yeah, that's true. So I kind of-- and that's kind of like The best possible scenario for me, you know. Yeah. And then now that I feel that way, I hope, you know, I'd love to be able to stick around and have More of an opportunity to get to that, 'cause I do feel... Yeah.

But in reality I think, like, I might have missed out On some really good, you know, opportunities To really get, you know, close to somebody... Mm-hmm. Because I had some fears within me About opening up to the point of, like, being super vulnerable and being, you know, hurt. It just hit me, and I was like, you know, "what am I doing?" Like, why am I, just because I'm afraid to get hurt, Going through meaningless relationship after relationship and just not getting deep with somebody and getting... Mm-hmm.

I was not expecting it to have the impact That it has had on me. I'm forever changed. Ashley : I feel like I owe it to the guys To let them know that I really want them to be here. (ben f.) ashley's great. We're making a connection. (Ryan p.) at some point, The man claws are gonna come out. That's the biggest rose as of yet. I'm gonna steal her really quick. (blake) you know, I'd be shocked and appalled if Ryan walked away With this one, too. (thunder rumbling) Ashley : I had a really good date With constantine yesterday. He made me feel so hopeful that this could still work for me. My heart is still aching from bentley leaving, but my mind is a lot more open now than it was When I was in l.A. Hey, guys. I have to give these guys what they deserve, and that's to not think about bentley and to just Move forward with the guys on this amazing journey. So this is gonna be such a great day. Maybe some of you guys know, but in 2004 There was a huge tsunami here, and it left a lot of people really devastated and left a lot of children without parents, So this is the baan san fan orphanage, A community that was created to kind of create a family For these children that lost their parents. It actually started with tents, and it's built into something so great, So what we're gonna be doing today is taking over this place and painting interior, exterior. We're gonna be putting up soccer nets... Nice. This will be great. Nice. So we're just gonna make this place great for the kids. I'm so excited about it. I guess we're gonna be bringing the sunshine to them, Even though it's raining a little bit. (J.P.) this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Ashley could've done anything in the world today, and she chose To be here, and that just speaks volumes about somebody, That they're that selfless that they want to spend A precious moment helping out, giving back. It's exhilarating. We're here to work, and I'm just happy I could be a part of it. I've got paint right here. Holy smokes, man. There is a lot to do. So let's move that stuff to the center of the room. It says a lot of positive things About ashley that she would set up something like this. Yeah. There's a lot of tragedy that happened here, bud. You know? Being here and doing this, Helping these people is an absolute eye-opener. We take for granted every day what we have. I'm happy to help 'em. This is awesome. It's amazing what a little paint can do to a room. For ashley to organize this and get this together-- It's huge. And helping out the orphanage-- This is just--it's awesome. Apparently there's some plants That are out there to go-- that need unloading. Uh, what do you think? You guys wanna go hit that up? Everybody had the mind-set that we were here To get some work done. If there's anybody today That's gonna try and make themself visible and attract attention, it'll be Ryan, and I think that That was more evident today in the group setting. Someone can, um, do A decent job along the edges with a paintbrush. (speaks indistinctly) Ryan has started to just kinda irk everybody. He's--just has a different personality. We--we really do need to find stuff to put on the ground. See? I mean, look at how much he's already dripping on the ground. There are times where my Ryan meter, you know, Reaches a max, and I just... Ugh. It's too much. Peace and productivity. He's constantly on, and it's-- it's just a little much. Is there any more blue? We can finish that off, right? Man : there's quite a few tasks here to do. (lucas) Ryan's getting on some people's nerves. I'm down with this. We can help make their lives a little brighter. You know, I think Ryan does well in his business. You know, I think he's over a few people, but we're all leaders, you know. He needs to back off a little bit. (chuckles) Am I doing okay? You're a pro. I am? Yeah. Ashley : today we're pulling together as a team and really making this orphanage a better place for the kids, and hopefully it will allow me to reconnect with the guys. You guys are, like, hard-core about it. No messing around. We're here to work. We're here to work. We wanted to finish it. Yeah. No flirting, nothing. No. No, this isn't the time for flirting. We'll flirt later. Like, this-- Ashley : after everything that happened with the rose and then with bentley, I'm worried that I'm losing the connection with these guys. All right. I'll let you guys get back to it then. Nice. I just want to let them know that I want them to be here, and I want to spend more time with each of them, and I really hope that things will turn around. Ooh-la-la! (laughs) looks good. (ben f.) I came up with the idea to maybe, you know, Personalize this experience a little bit and paint a mural for the kids, even though I can't paint. It's a start. No, it's a good start. Okay. Should I get in with the flowers? Yeah. I think so. (ben f.) I like spending time with ashley and being able To kinda be creative and show her that I'm not afraid To kind of express my artistic side. What kind of flower is that? I'm not sure. (laughs) it's the ashley flower. If you can find something that separates you from the herd, Then do it, and that's where you'll stand out. That looks great. Aw. Ashley : ben was really sweet. I'm starting to feel better. I think spending time with him was really what I needed To start getting over bentley. Such a good idea. (laughs) great idea? I just want you guys to know that these kids Really, really do appreciate everything you're doing, and I'm gonna let them tell you that. Here they are. (laughs) Men : hey! Hey, guys! (Ryan p.

Well, I wasn't at the last group date, and judging by everybody else's reaction Of who got it the last time, I think if he got it again, People would just leave. Yeah. That's a good point. Mm.

And I'm very impressed. You're, like, an interesting person, and there's a lot to you. Thank you. I think I've probably just skimmed the surface. Yeah. But, uh... I think it'll be fun to dig deeper one day and just have fun with it. I'm so glad to have some time alone To get to know the true ames. He's smart, he's charming, he's flirtatious. He's really funny, and I did not know this about him. Time is running out here, and there are so many great guys here. Sure. So... After taking some time away and really thinking about it... Yes? Um... You are so great, and I wanna offer you this rose. (laughs) Wow. You're very good at-- So, ames, will you accept this rose? Yes, only you could offer such a brilliant rose delivery. This is why I really like you. (ames) I had really high expectations for today, and any high expectations I had were so exceeded today. All right, ames. Yay! Thank you. She brings out a side of me that's actually funny, Which is remarkable and I never knew even existed. Did I scare you with the rose thing? Yeah, you did, of course. (laughs) Which is a good sign. If I had been really cool and collected, Not the right guy. You'd be like, "ah, I don't care." Ashley and I didn't kiss tonight, but we did something much more intimate than kiss. We talked about very serious things, and I feel like we have a strong foundation to build on. I knew ashley was beautiful all along, but now that I've really gotten to know her, She has sort of an inner beauty that just makes her That much more attractive to me. She's a remarkable woman, and I hope ashley and I can find lasting love. Coming up... I'm really scared to open myself up To somebody that might become another bentley. I just wanna be sure that there's not something That I should be really concerned about. Man : tonight I think everybody's on edge. If there was one person that's grating on almost everyone, Um, you know, it would be you. Really? Yeah. Man : no one in the house can really stand the guy. Now are you ever not like this? (laughs) god. What, you can't hang with the fact That I'm freaking happy a lot? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm not grumpy. (men speaking indistinctly) Ah. Very nice. Yeah, this is really nice. Ashley : it's been a week since bentley left, and I was really nervous Going into the last rose ceremony. I canceled the cocktail party Because I was in such a dark place. Hey, guys! Man : hey! How are you? A week has gone by, and I'm feeling a lot better. I'm still... Somewhat in a dark place, but I've been able to really take some steps forward, and I'm gonna use tonight to hopefully continue Heading in the right direction. You guys have no idea how different I feel right now Than I did last week. So... Cheers to getting some time with all of you guys tonight. (all) cheers. (clink) I really need to spend tonight Asking the guys some serious questions In order to figure out whether or not I could potentially get hurt again. I'm really scared to open myself up To somebody that might become another bentley. Wow, west. Hey, you. How's it going? Good, good. How are you? Good. West is a really sweet guy, but I know he's been through a lot recently. His wife passed away a few years ago, and I can't even begin to imagine What something like that would be like. Um, I just wanna really be sure that he's actually In a good place to be thinking about marriage again. You know, you've been through so much recently, and I'm thinking, you know, Do you really feel like you're ready? Um... I do feel like it's a situation Where it takes a while to get over that kind of thing. Mm-hmm. And, uh, There have certainly been times in the past When I wasn't ready. But I've taken a lot of time for myself and come To a completely different sort of self-awareness. And although I'm very happy to have had what I had and obviously sad that I lost it... Mm-hmm. I am at a completely different place now, and it's always gonna be a part of me. Right. I understand that. But I'm very much ready to-- to move on and--and find happiness again, you know? Like, I just, uh, I fully believe that I'm ready. I mean, I love how you-- you, you know, Kinda like extracted the positive From everything that's happened. But for me, when I think about a relationship between us, You know, I do think, Oh, wow, you know, I have some really big shoes to fill. You know? (laughs) that's... And--and... (laughs) It's just one of the things that I think about when I'm-- (tapping sound) when, um, when I think About, like, starting a relationship with you. No, I-I-I hear you. And I guess what I want to say, what I want you to hear is that it's not--you're not trying to fill shoes. It's a completely different situation. Okay. That was in a particular part of my life, and it was amazing. But it was different. It was completely separate. And it's not as if you're walking Into a situation Where you're trying to step into someone else's shoes. I'm a completely different me now than I was then. Mm-hmm. West is a really nice guy, and I do see some potential with him. I'm just really unsure if he's at a point Where he's ready to move forward. Um, and that kinda scares me. (sighs) I've dated-- well, I don't know. Like, I didn't date much, uh, after my divorce... Mm-hmm. But the people I hung out with is-- They were free-spirited or they were more conservative. Okay. I was just kinda trying different things, you know... Okay. So if I saw you, let's say at a restaurant Or something like that, I would absolutely approach you. For one, you're gorgeous, and two... Okay. Thank you. I'm so open-minded and, um, but kinda what you see is what you get, and I want you to see that with me... Mm-hmm. And, like, give me a shot, like, of-- Let's just--I just like having a good time. I really do. Yeah. Now your relationship, when it closed off, Is it something that was completely closed, Or is there still residual feeling Or resentment or anything like that? You know, I'm always gonna care about my ex-wife. Mm-hmm. I mean, we were together so long, just on--in-- All through college, you know, college sweetheart... Right. So, um, the love was gone. The passion was gone, So I don't want you to worry about that. Mm-hmm. You know, it's been almost three years now. I just have a void in my life right now, and I know exactly what it is. It's finding an awesome woman again, you know... Mm-hmm. And my ex-wife was awesome, you know. It just didn't work out. We both just fell out of love, and I hate that term. I don't know if that exists... Yeah. But I guess--I don't know how to really explain it. So I'm wondering, is that something, like, How do you--how are you gonna deal with that now, like, If you were to be in a new relationship and you lost the passion? Mm-hmm. Or how do you keep the passion alive? I'm not the type of guy that gives up on anything ever. Okay. I know you were upset last week, and it just killed me, Because we wouldn't-- at least me-- I would not be here if I didn't see some kind of connection Or I wanted to get to know you more or whatever else... Right. So--but you're a sweetheart, and you're beautiful... Thank you. Thanks, lucas. And I would love to get to know you better. I always seem to be attracted to southern gentlemen, and lucas is just that. Whenever I'm around him, I feel really secure and... Almost taken care of. Talking to lucas makes me feel a lot more hopeful That the guys are actually here for me, and maybe I shouldn't worry as much. Man : what's going on with Ryan? Man : something just doesn't gel, you know? I don't know. Man : I don't particularly care for him. It doesn't take a rocket scientist To figure it out, too. Yeah, I think she's, uh, she's a smart enough girl... Man : yeah. She's aware. And she's--she has enough awareness... Yeah. To realize that--that obviously something's up. (blake) most of the guys in the house don't like Ryan. He just has some personality quirks That make it difficult to want to hang out with him. You know, if I have a problem with Ryan, I'm gonna talk to Ryan about it. I will share my opinion When maybe someone doesn't want to hear it. I-I tell the truth, and I'm not going to apologize for that. Out of everyone here, It's kind of a unanimous thing where, you know, If there was one person that's grating on almost everyone, Um, you know, it would be you. Really? Yeah, and that's-- wow. That's one of those things where it's kinda tough To put a finger on, you know? Really? Um... Yeah, I mean--I mean... It--it's just-- really? Yeah, it's... (chuckles) Really? So, man, well, I don't understand, 'cause I-I don't have problems with guys, like... Yeah, well... You know, I really-- you know, and--and so... It's just a matter of intensity. You get extremely enthusiastic and excited about things... (laughs) yeah. And very loud and boisterous and--and-- yeah, that's me. It's just ridiculous. It's preposterous. I mean, okay. What, you can't hang with the fact That I'm freakin' happy a lot? What? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm not grumpy. My bad. I guess I should just be grumpy. It has been raining a lot, though. It really has been raining a lot. Maybe I should be grumpy. Sorry. I'm in phuket, thailand. It's kinda nice. Think about all our soldiers that our overseas right now. Why the heck wouldn't you be happy and be so stoked to be in this opportunity When you could be freaking over there and every morning you're waking up to mortar shots and... You know, anyways. Okay. Yeah. Fire away. People are still trying to get a feel on, You know, exactly how genuine you are, Because some people think that ashley shows up and a different Ryan comes out, you know. It just seems like You're trying really hard to say the perfect thing all the time and be very politically correct all the time, and that just comes across As somewhat disingenuous sometimes. (blake) no one in the house can really stand the guy. It's like he's 8 years old, you know, and that kind of zest for life is fine every now and then... Oh, nice. Beautiful. Isn't this gorgeous? But at the same time, when you deal with it every single day, It becomes... Just completely infuriating somehow. Ashley needs to see the intense Ryan That has come to annoy everyone. I mean, I don't really see him sticking around very long. What's on your mind? Oh, man. So much stuff, I don't even know where to start. But I have a question for you. Bring it. You seem so happy all the time. This is exactly-- blake just pulled me aside and talked all about this with me. What do you mean? Oh, go ahead. You bring it to me. (chuckles) bring it. So I seem so happy all the time. You seem so happy all the time. What makes you sad? What makes you mad? And are you ever not like this? Um... (chuckles) the-- God, there's been a lot of this conversation. Um, everyone's like, "what the heck?" like-- Really? Yeah, you know, or--well, blake just said, "you know, it just seems-- how could you possibly-- You just have so much energy all the time." mm-hmm. And, yeah, I'm happy a lot, and I bring a lot of enthusiasm, and I don't know where it comes from. I'm just like... I'm bursting with a lot of-- a lot of love in my chest, and it... I don't know. It just goes. So this is the real you, right? (chuckles) I mean, it's a good thing. Yes, this is me. This is me... This is how you've always been? And these guys can't understand it, Because we're together so much, you know? Mm-hmm. And--and I'm just--I'm just, I guess, bringing it every day, and I guess, you know, maybe they're getting tired of it... Mm-hmm. But I can't-- you think they're getting tired of it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know about that, you know, um... Mm-hmm. But, um, this is me. I'm-- that's a good thing. I've got a lot of-- a lot of love for just living. Life is a gift... Mm-hmm. And it can go at any moment, and I hope that we can continue to spend more time together and explore this further. I love the fact That Ryan p. Has so much positive energy. He's really smart and so successful. He just has his act together, and I know that he could bring out the best in me. (clinks) guys, how's it going? Men : hey. Good to see all of you again. Ash, if you would, come join me. Ashley : tonight turned out to be such a great night. I went in with a lot of questions, and I walked out with a lot of answers. I'm realizing how many great guys are here, and it's really allowing me to open myself up To the possibility of finding real love. All right. We'll see you in a bit. All right. See ya. (west) I think I'm on the chopping block tonight, and of course it's scary. Of course I want to stay. I mean, she is definitely the type of girl That I would like to spend more time with. You know, I know who I want, what I want, and I see that, A lot of that, in her. (lucas) tonight I think everybody's on edge. I tell you, going to the rose ceremony without a rose Definitely gets the heart to beating. Um, you know, you just never know When your--when your day has come. (chuckles) (Ryan p.) if I got sent home tonight, I'd be surprised. I'd be surprised if she sent me home, plain and simple, Um, because I think we have something going well, but if not, then I'm just drastically off. Have a seat. (sighs) So how are you doing? Much better this week. Yeah, a better week? It turned out to be a great week, actually. The dates were great. Yeah. The one-on-one date with constantine was so great, and ames blew me away. He was just himself. Yeah. So intelligent, so funny. Right. Probably the sweetest guy I've ever met in my life. Then, uh, it was the group date. Great group date. My favorite group date so far. I have such a great group of guys, and the dates really Showed me that, you know, this could work for me. 'cause a week ago, We're sitting in los angeles. You're heartbroken. You were devastated. Have you put everything past you with bentley, Or are you still hung up a little bit? Um, to answer that very honestly... Yeah. I'm still a little bit hung up, and I still wonder what could've been, Because in such a short amount of time, I felt so strongly for him, and I was so certain... Right. Mm-hmm. And my, you know, like, a woman's intuition-- I really just feel like there's something more there... Right. But I don't know if I'll ever get to the bottom of that. Is it because of the whole dot, dot, dot" not really having that closure thing? You still--like, in your mind, is there still that door open? I think the door is still open. There's the dot, dot, dot there. There's n-- there isn't great closure, So for me personally, I have a hard time Moving forward from that. Will you ever get over him? The potential for bentley and I was so great... Right. So strong in your heart and mind. I get that. That I'll never know what could've been. Bottom line--he's still on your mind very much, isn't he? You know, early on, I was dead set on one guy... Right. Right. And I really was closed off to all the others, and I almost didn't give anyone else a chance, and I realize That I can't do that. Because, you know, one thing stood out to me. You know, last week when we were in los angeles, you said, "my biggest fear now is this isn't going to work for me." Mm-hmm. It's hard because I felt so strongly for him, and I didn't feel that same way About the other guys, um, at that time. Mm-hmm. Now things are starting to change. Things are starting to kind of move forward,  So I'm starting to see how that could happen,  And everything that matters to me are the guys That are here. And they've chosen to be here. And they've-- they've chosen to stay here. And there are a couple of relationships that I see. Maybe they will surpass what I felt for--for bentley... Yeah. And that's what I'm hoping for. Well, let's talk about The decision you have to make tonight. 12 guys. 2 guys going home. Where is your head at? Where's your heart at As you head into this rose ceremony? So, like I was talking about, the date with ames-- I really--it w-- it took me by surprise. I didn't think that he was gonna still be here, and that's why I think I need to be more open to the guys That I'm not certain that I want to send home, so tonight, You know, I'm hoping to maybe break the rules a little bit, and I'm hoping to send only one guy home. You're saying you want To add a rose to the rose ceremony tonight? Yeah. There are 11 men here that I could see myself with, and I want to give them another shot. Ames is a perfect example of what can happen here, Where you're about to send a guy home... Mm-hmm. And it turns out he's a great guy, and you're like, "god, I almost missed that"... Yeah. And you could've missed that. Going into ames's date, I really thought he was going home, and he's the type of man that I would want to be with. I get it. You don't want to send the wrong guy home. No. I don't want to make any mistakes. Yeah. I don't want to have any regrets. Well, we're not breaking the rules. There are no rules... Okay. So I'm good with this. If this is what you want to do, we'll make it happen. I'll go, uh, get the guys ready for the rose ceremony. I will add the extra rose... Okay. And, uh, when you're ready, come join us, all right? Great. Thanks so much, Chris. I'm really having a hard time deciding Who I'm gonna be sending home tonight. I'm seeing some really great qualities In these guys, and I'm scared to make a decision that I'm gonna regret For the rest of my life. My biggest fear is that I get heartbroken again, and I do not want to send the wrong guy home tonight. I just don't want to make any more mistakes. (thunder rumbles) Guys, good to see you again. It's been a little rainy, but I know you've enjoyed an incredible experience Of being here on the island of phuket, but it's time for another rose ceremony. Three of you already have roses. Ames, ben f., constantine, Nothing to worry about tonight. Nine of you guys left. Only seven roses. I don't know if you remember earlier tonight, Ashley said, "expect the unexpected." With that in mind, she's asked me for a favor tonight-- Another rose. Her main goal is to leave here with no regrets, and a big part of that is making sure she doesn't say good-bye To the right guy, So with that said, Another rose up for grabs, Which means only one of you will be leaving here tonight. I wish you all the best, and if you're ready, here's ashley. (whispers) hi, Chris. When you're ready. (normal voice) I came into this week Not really knowing what to expect, but I was so pleasantly surprised. Um, you guys are so amazing, and I want to be sure That I'm giving everyone the right amount of time, um, So I can learn enough about you to make a really good decision. I can't tell you how happy I am With the group of guys that I have, um, and every day I feel more grateful that each of you are here. ♪ (thunder rumbles) Lucas. Whoo! (laughs) Thank you.

Nice to meet you. (whispers indistinctly) ♪ (vehicle door opens) (door closes) (sighs) You know, since my wife passed, this is the first time That I've really let it all hang out, so to speak. I completely put myself out there. I had a great love, and I will always cherish that, and unfortunately it's gone now, but... At least I had it. Ashley may have had the wrong impression. She may have thought I wasn't completely ready. She expressed concern about it tonight, That she felt like she would have Some big shoes to fill. You can't replace someone that you really loved and--and was taken from you. That's not what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to move on. Life is love. If you don't have it, you know, You can be happy on so many levels, but it's so much more satisfying and deeper If you have someone to share it with, and, um, hopefully one day I'll find it. It's always really hard to say good-bye To somebody that I really cared about, but, um, it makes me happy looking around, Knowing that I'm one step closer to finding my husband. Um, I'm so glad that you guys are all here, and I'm excited to tell you that we are going to continue Our journey here in thailand. We're going to be going To one of the most exotic, historic cities in the world-- Chiang mai. (cheering) (clink) next week on the bachelorette"... (snorts) Ashley : whoa!

Man : this is far and away The most incredible place I've ever seen. Ashley : if things continue the way they're going right now, I think that this could be a very happy ending for me. Oh! Oh! (crowd shouting indistinctly) (siren wails) (heart beating) Ashley : I can't believe this. I did not anticipate this date going this way. It actually blew up right in my face. Man : immediately you could tell that ashley was just not right. At this point, some people still have you on their mind. Some--some people don't. I want to end the date right now. (ashley) after everything that happened today... (thunder rumbling) I can't help but compare the guys To what I felt for bentley. Do you feel closer to the guys than you do me? Naturally. For some reason... (sighs) I just-- I can't stop thinking about him. I need to stop. (whispers) I need to stop thinking about this. Can I come in? What are you doing here? He's in this hotel... Shut up! Right now. (voice breaking) are you serious? I can't believe this. ♪ It's all coming up on... So do you think You could do a push-up with me sitting on you? I'm sure I could. Really?
