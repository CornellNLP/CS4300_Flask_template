 Previously on... 
 Ali : New York! 
 (both) Whoo! 
 Ali : New York was the perfect place for me to start My tour around the world with these guys. 
 I think you are just awesome, like, such a cool guy. 
 You are my favorite! 
 Ali : seeing Joshua radin, I just felt overwhelmed with emotion. 
 It's so amazing that Roberto and I were on Broadway. 
 (singing African language) 
 Roberto : it was special, to say the least. 
 Frank : as if it's not bad enough, We've got to sit there and watch. 
 Just stab us and just Twist the knife, you know? Thank you. 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Man : he's totally obsessed with her, and he's gonna freak her out. 
 How do you know when that person's right for you? 
 It's just my heart. 
 Jump in. Stay a while. 
 (sighs) 
 Kasey : I'm going to prove that I am genuine and I have a huge heart. 
 (buzzing) 
 Ty : Kasey is getting crazier by the minute. 
 I came here to guard and protect her heart. 
 So, yes, I went and got a tattoo, and you guys are All more than welcome to see it. 
 Frank : getting a tattoo-- that doesn't prove anything Except the fac that you're nuts. 
 (laughs) 
 And tonight... 
 Ali : we're in Iceland. The volcano actually erupted for the first time in 200 years. (cheering) This place is incredible. Aah! (laughs) you did it! Ali : I am almost positive I'm gonna fall in love here... I just think you're really great. But I am terrified I won't be loved back. So tell me some other things that I don't know about you. Kirk : I'm nervous to tell Ali about my history, but there's something that I need to get off my chest. I should be happy, but I'm not because Ali's over there. (laughs) Frank : it's driving me insane. I'm just an emotional disaster. When are you gonna show her that tattoo? I don't know, man. I got this tattoo to be someone and to be a man, to be a man for that woman. Kasey : I could take the physical pain. The physical pain is nothing to me. But this emotional pain? I'm tired of it. I'm Kasey Kahl. I'm a dreamer. I'm a believer. And if I get sent home, that's gonna destroy me. (airplane engine roaring) It says "'ást'"-- "ást' is the noun for 'love" in Icelandic." I want to find love in Iceland. Hey, girl. Say, "hey." Ty : it never crossed our mind that we'd be flying to Iceland. I get chills when I think about Starting off on the West coast, Going to New York, Now in Iceland, and you're like, oh, my gosh. I don't think anybody dreams of going to Iceland to find love. But now that we're here, I'm ready to find it. We'll just have to see who gets that rose, 'cause I'm pretty sure I've got one right here, buddy. Are you willing to do that? I think Iceland will be a great place to show her my tattoo. Uh, it just depends. It depends. It's gotta be the right moment, The right place and the right time. Whoo! Iceland. All right. We're gonna heat Iceland up a little bit. But not in a million years did I ever think I'd come to Iceland to find love. But here I am, chasing Ali, uh, with other guys and, uh, I'm gonna keep traveling the world for her Whether it's in Iceland, New York, California. Wherever it is, I'm here for her. ♪ Ali : Iceland is incredible. Our first stop abroad is pretty remarkable. It's so gorgeous. It's absolutely beautiful. It's pretty extreme, From this glacier with 1,000-year-old ice To this volcano with burning hot lava. The volcano actually erupted recently For the first time in 200 years, So we picked a pretty exciting time to be in Iceland. (honking) I've come to this magical place With nine amazing guys. I'm confident that there'll be a guy here that I'll love. My biggest concern is will he love me back? Man : it is so cold right now. Kasey : I'm freezing. That's why-- that's why I love my hat. Fellas, good morning. Come on over. Hello, Chris. Men : hello. Gentlemen, welcome to The beautiful country of Iceland, Your next stop on the journey to find love with Ali. Man : Whoo! Whoo! Man : yeah! Let's talk about what's going on this week. As usual, there will be three dates-- A group date, a one-on-one date and a special two-on-one date. Now this date is a little bit different, obviously. Two of you will go out. Only one of you will return. Ali will give out a rose on this date. If you do not get a rose, you'll be going home immediately. Kasey : wow. By this time, you guys realize The one-on-one date is where you want to be. You get the most time with Ali. So who gets it this week? Well, it's gonna be a little different. This time you're going to be competing for it. (men laugh) Kirk : oh, God. You're going to write a love poem to Ali... (Kasey laughs) (man groans) Nice. And perform it in front of her, and she will decide who gets the one-on-one date this week. Kasey : Ce. Oh, and by the way, if you can slide in an Icelandic word, I'm guessing there's gonna be a little extra credit for you. All right? You have one hour to write your love poem to Ali. Pen and paper is waiting for you. Good luck. (indistinct conversations) It's so important that Ali likes the poem and that I get the one-on-one date today, Because that's the best way to spend your time with her. I just want to make her laugh. That's, like, the biggest thing. Chris L. : I love spending time with Ali. When I spend time With her, I'm just smiling, I'm just happy and just fun. I'd love a one-on-one date in Iceland. I don't want the two-on-one, 'cause that's pressure, 'cause one person goes home. Okay, I got it. I got it. I got this. Kasey : an hour--that's not too much time to put together A love poem of how you feel. But I just need that one-on-one time to make it special. I've been waiting for the right place, the right time To show her my tattoo. I mean, it's a great thing. It's a great thing I did to make her know, like, hey, I'm your man, you know, I'm your guy, I'm your heart. I'm looking to, uh, learn a couple, uh, Icelandic words. How do you say "I love you"? (speaking Icelandic) (speaking Icelandic) (speaks Icelandic) yeah. Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? Two seconds. Two seconds. Not ast. Ást. Ást? Ást. Ást, like an o"? Ást? Ást. Can I ask you a question? No? (speaking Icelandic) Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? No. Hang on. Come here. Wait. No. Okay. (speaks Icelandic) Is that okay? Yeah, well... Oh, man. No one wants to help the guy on the crutches. That's okay. (bell tolling) All right, fellas, the hour is up. Come on over. Mine came to me pretty quick. It might suck, but it came pretty quick. Frank : I've written a number of love poems in my day. I'm trying to make this one kind of cute. I don't want to get too lovey-dovey. But I love writing, and so I'm excited. I feel good about it. Chris N. : I should probably practice it one time before. Roberto : that's a good idea. I don't have much experience really, like, writing poems. There's a lot of pressure involved with this. Being on the two-on-one date-- I'm not gonna lie-- That would really stink. Justin : approaching people with the crutches Definitely did slow me down. It's a little bit scary Because the one-on-one dates is gonna be based on these poems, and I really need this date. Now that the group is Getting smaller and smaller, Everyone's taking things a lot more serious. I definitely think the stakes are a lot higher now. Coming up... (speaks Icelandic) Ali : I think it's difficult for guys to express Their feelings through poetry. This is just pretty much me, and, uh, I forgot the rest of my lines. (laughs) Kasey : Justin is gonna be Shady. Who knows what he's gonna do? Maybe he'll tell Ali about my tattoo. You know, my hand's kind of, like, twitching a little bit. When that happens, that's when, like, my adrenaline goes. Justin : you know, I definitely see a little bit of fear In Kasey's eyes, and when you see a little bit of fear In the--your opponent's eyes, take him out. ♪ Fellas, come on over. For the one-on-one date, We have to write some love poems r Ali. It's imperative have one-on-one time with Ali Because then I'll be able to show her my tattoo. Then I'll be able to see her heart, and she'll be able to see mine. (Craig) I'm one of the only ones That hasn't had that one-on-one date yet. I feel like it's really important for me To get this date, and I want it really badly. You know, I'm over the group dates. I want the chance to spend significant and intimate time With Ali to see where my relationship with her stands. So how did we do? Man : all right. You know what's on the line here-- The one-on-one date with Ali. If you're ready, here she is. Man : there we go. Man : ow! Ali : welcome to Iceland! (speaks Icelandic) I learned Icelandic. She's as cute as she can be in the boots and the jacket and with her hat on. Uh, I think she can pretty much rock anything she wears. All right, we got some poets among us? Yeah. Are you ready? (laughs) yeah. Ali : I think it's difficult for guys to express their feelings, Especially through poetry. Not only did they write the poems, but they're gonna read them to me in front of the other guys, and that's gotta be hard. And I think it takes a real man To sort of just buck up and do it. All right. "I've been working on my Icelandic. (speaks Icelandic) that means at the end of this journey, "I want nothing more than to be your man. I have a confession, Ali. I made up that Icelandic d took a chance." (laughs) (laughter) "I will do anything to win your heart and to end this journey with romance." (Craig) I think my poem was outstanding. I mean, performance-wise, You know, just the words and the meaning themselves. I'm the winner, without a doubt. Man : go. Kasey : I've never written a love poem, but I'm not nervous about that. I'm here to guard and protect Ali's heart. That's what makes me confident, that's it's definitely easy To write something from the heart to a woman like Ali. I'm very excited for her to hear my heart and hear my words and put everything together so I can make her smile. in the mind and heart of one thought, my body is cold as ice. but the belief in what's to come transcends the doubt and becomes very precise." Chris L. : I think Kasey, uh, when he read his poem, I think his lips were a little frozen because he mumbled. I couldn't really understand a word he was saying. And all I heard was... (mumbles) We're all like, we need, like, subtitles. (speaks indistinctly) And I promise you, Ali, you'll always have my... (speaks indistinctly) (laughs) Kasey : my poem's awesome. She smiled. She loved it. I am 100% confident that I'm gonna get that one-on-one date. I've got my heart on my sleeve. I've got my shield ready to go. There's no doubt in my mind that I am the man. You have to try to take me seriously in this hat. Even though it's goofy, I'm glad to have it. (laughter) That was part of mine. Add that in there. "Ali, when I look at you, you seem like you could be the one. But if not, I don't think my life will be much fun." (speaks Icelandic haltingly) "I want to take you to meet the fam. I'll even make you some eggs and ham." (chuckles) (chuckles) "two important things are... (speaks Icelandic haltingly) "I'm sorry, but that's the end of this, Because I can't make a rhyme with that." (Craig) I think this was a tough position to be in for anybody, but Chris n.'s was just kinda... I don't--I don't even know what to make of it. Ali, I believe we need to go out, Heat up Iceland and head out. (exhales deeply) The bells that have been ringing Out here today Have brought me these thoughts that I need to say. I want to melt down some things, Like some, um... Frank : I think we all kind of cringed. I was kinda like... Looking over at Ali, looking at the rest of the guys, and, like, this is a nightmare. When is it over? This is just pretty much me wanting to get to know you. And, uh, I forgot the rest of my lines. I want this one-on-one date more than anything right now, So I definitely have to step up my game. "Ali, Los Angeles is where our, uh, journey had begun and where I first noticed your adorable freckles..." (laughs) in the California sun. Next off to New York, and for the first time, I found myself falling into your rich root beer eyes." (chuckles) Aw. "This journey now has led us both somewhere cold but it's here in Iceland, I'm hoping..." (speaks Icelandic haltingly) (laughs) "or in English, Our love will unfold." Aw. (laughs) mm. Frank : I had a feeling that kirk would impress me, and he did. So I think he's some of the tougher competition. But I love writing. I love poems. I'm actually pretty good at it. So I'm thinking this is my cup of tea. I'm thinking I'm--I'm gonna do pretty well here. "some time ago, I traveled overseas with a girl that I loved. She made me weak in the knees. "my heart has since broken, my faith in love torn, Then I looked in your eyes, and new hope was born." Aw. again I'll follow my heart because I trust it with you. you're honest, you're genuine, you're sweet, and you're kinda cute, too." (laughs) "as they say here in Iceland..." (speaks Icelandic) "and I wish I knew what that meant or if it even made sense." (laughs) (Chris Harrison laughs) All right, guys, good job, Other than the fact I think We all just butchered the Icelandic language, and for that, I apologize to the people here. Have you come to a decision? I have. Okay. And again, you guys know what's on the line. The gentleman she chooses gets the one-on-one date. So I'll hand it over to you. Okay. Thank you, guys. That was so fun. Um, in the end, I thought you guys would learn from example last time-- The guys who were on the lion king" date-- If you come up to me... (laughs) during the poem, It holds a little bit more weight. So the two guys that did that were kirk and Frank. I really liked, uh, kirk, that you tied in things About, like, our journey, and--and I haven't had a one-on-one with kirk yet, Uh, so I think in the end, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna pick kirk to go on this date. Really? Oh. I like the freckles. (laughs) it's my first one-on-one date. I'm excited. Ali and I--we've built a pretty good connection For the time we spent with each other. I just wanna solidify that. I wanna keep our momentum going, and I want her to see that I potentially Could be her husband. Hey, give me a hug. Ty : nice, kirk. Thank you. I cannot wait. Kirk's a lucky guy. I mean, and honest opinion, Hope he doesn't come home with the rose. I just want her all to myself. I mean, that may sound selfish, but I can't get enough of her. I just want her all to myself. I don't wanna share. I came here to find love, and I'm gonna continue To pursue Ali and continue to try and make her understand That I am genuine and I am sincere. Whoo! I was a little upset that kirk took the one-on-one date today. Anytime Ali spends a date with somebody else, I'm gonna be a little jealous. I just want more time with her. I need more time with her. Coming up... So tell me some things that I don't know about you. Ali : I feel like kirk is keeping something back. I'm hoping that he's able to tell me what's going on. Like, what is your dating history? We can talk about that maybe later. I'm not trying to just stick around. I'm trying to be the man of her dreams. That's why I got this tattoo, to be someone. Frank : I think this experience is pushing Kasey over the edge. Kasey : I'm Kasey. I'm a dreamer. I'm a believer. I love to love. I love to give I love to share. If I get sent home, that's gonna destroy me. ♪ Ali : today is my first date with kirk, and he has such a great energy and he's so positive. He has this joy for life that's infectious. Today I wanna get to know more about kirk and see if he could be, you know, a potential husband. Aah! (laughs) Hey! (laughs) hey. I'm super excited to spend time with Ali, but I do know That at the end of the night, I could potentially be going home, So that makes me a little nervous, 'cause emotionally, I'm invested. I wanna stay. I wanna get to know her. I want an opportunity to be with her. So, um, I know what's on the line. I know, isn't it crazy, our first, like, date is in Iceland? You look like you kinda belong, though. (laughs) I do? A little bit. You do. I feel like when you travel with someone, you get OT know them, and kirk and I get to explore Reykjavik today and, uh, absorb the local culture, and I think the first stop is, Uh, to learn how to dress like a local. Be prepared. (laughs) how attracted to me are you right now? I feel really close to Ali right now. It's really special when you can find a-a woman That you can be your little kid self around. It looks like something my Dad would wear. Kirk : I feel like I can Bring my inner child out when I'm with her, and it's okay. Did you really think this looks good? It is so much fun being with kirk in the sweater shop and trying on silly sweaters and just joking around. You know, we both like to laugh a lot and just have fun, but I never thought we'd end up looking like this. (laughs) Walking around wearing the same outfit, but, uh, I don't care. I don't care what I'm wearing when I'm with her. This one right here. Ready? Here. Go. I'm scared. If you drop it at the right time... Aah! (laughs) You did it! Walking around with kirk, I feel like we're a couple, and, uh, I'm having such a great time exploring with him. I would get the door for you, but we're connected. One thing I love about him is he's so upbeat and positive. And, you know, I didn't think I'd feel this close to kirk, but, you know, I think I could see lf with him. So tell me some things that I don't know about you. Like, what is your dating history? Um, well, first of all, I haven't-- I haven't dated anybody, um, for more than a year. So I haven't had--I mean, I've had multiple relationships-- You seem so loble. That--you see-- I don't understand how that's possible. I... I'm nervous to tell Ali about my history and what I've been through. Opening up to Ali isn't easy Because it leaves me exposed. It leaves me vulnerable. It makes me nervous 'cause I've been hurt in the past. Well, I'll be honest with you, I, um, like, I've-- I've dated some--some great women, I mean people that... I can't say a bad thing about. Mm-hmm. But we can talk about that maybe later. Ali : it definitely concerns me That he hasn't dated anyone for more than a year. You know, I feel like kirk is keeping something back, and I don't know, I just feel like there's something else That I need to know. I'm gonna get the door for you, milady. I want to give him a rose, but I just don't know. I'm hoping that he's able to open up tonight and tell me what's going on. Ali : the water is so blue here. (bell tolling) Kirk : the water is gorgeous. You can see the mountains. ♪ Frank : I don't think kirk's coming home. Man : you got that feeling? I've got this gut feeling. (knock on door) Chris L. : gentlemen. Man : what's that, baby? Chris L. : I'm taking it this is the group date card. I want my name on there, Because if your name's not on this group date, You're going on the two-on-one, and one person goes home and one person stays, so that's where the pressure is. Gentlemen. Man : oh, what's up? Ty : read it. Read it. Name number one, or in this case, numero uno-- Roberto. Men : ooh. Okay. Next up--Chris lambton. That's me. Name number three-- Chris n. Next up--Craig. That's four. Next up--my other roommate... (whispers) Ty. (normal voice) well, I guess that means-- One, two and three are left. One of you is going on this date tomorrow. It's Frank the tank! Frank the tank! (laughter) that leaves Kasey and wrestler, So they've got the two-on-one date. Right away, I-I could tell Kasey was deflated. He was pissed. Those two don't see eye to eye, and I figure that'd be one hell of a matchup. Man : the battle royale. It's gonna be action-packed, that's for sure. You know, I definitely see A little bit of fear in Kasey's eyes, you know, and just like in the wrestling world, When you see a little bit of fear in the-- Your opponent's eyes, you gotta do what you gotta do. Basically, that's take him out. Know somebody That would be a great bachelor or bachelorette? Go to bachelor.ABC.Com and click apply." ♪ Ali : lobster house. Oh, I really love it. I'm having such a great time with kirk, but I feel like kirk's hiding something. I don't know. I just wish he would tell me what's going on. I wanna give him a rose, but I just don't know yet, and, um, I'm hoping he can open up to me and tell me what's up. As long as you know where I'm coming from, I think you'll know where I'm going. You know what I'm saying? Mm-hmm. Just so you know kinda, like, my background, Like, five years ago, I got pretty sick-- Sick to the point where, um, literally, I wasn't sure if I was gonna see the next day. Just terrible. Mm-hmm. So first of all, I was, like, a very-- Like, my identity was, like, a runner. I was very accomplished, and, um, I was an all-American my freshman year in college. I was 8th in the country in the 1,500... Wow. D I went on to college to train with friends. Mm-hmm. Um, and I moved back into this old college house. And as soon as I moved in that house, Like, I started, first of all, to develop breathing problems, Which, as a runner, is kind of a hindrance. Mm-hmm. And in the matter of a month, I lost, like, 15 pounds. And, like, my cheeks were, like. And I felt terrible, Um, and I couldn't figure out what was going on. Well, all of a sudden, weird things started happening, Like the hair on my arms started falling out. And then I was getting really confused, Like, I lost all my short-term memories. Mm-hmm. And then the left sideof my, and I tried to talk and nothing would come out. I tried to stand up, and my legs wouldn't work. I bet you there were a half a dozen nights Where I sat in bed and I thought, oh, my God. This is it. So I saw, like, 40 physicians, From the East coast, to the Mayo clinic, To San Francisco to see a specialist, and nobody could tell me what's wrong. And because I was so desperate and I was fearful for my life, I started on this alternative medicine path, and through all this and my mom's due diligence, We found out that two weeks before I moved into the house, The health department came in and deemed the house in college unlivable. There was, like, dozens of health code violations, but the biggest one was asbestos and then multiple mold overgrowth. And I breathed in this mold For, like, a year and a half while I lived there. And it really affects your nervous system, So it screws up everything from how you breathe To the neurons firing in your brain To your digestive system to everything. So I got awfully sick because of it. But it doesn't define me. It just--it just-- All it did was prioritize, like, what's important. I know that it's the people in my life and the relationships that I make That are most important to me. Something you said to me the first night-- And you probably don't remember this 'cause you talked to so many people-- But I said, "Ali, what are you really looking for?" And the first thing that came out of your mouth was, "I'm looking for somebody That makes me want to be a better person." And I feel like I want somebody that can teach me, I want somebody that can help me grow and I want somebody that'll be there in person and I want this, like, ever-forming relationship Where... It's this constant growth and admiration for one another. Mm-hmm. Well, I could say wholeheartedly, You definitely inspire me to be a better person. I just think you're really great. I think you're pretty special, too. (laughs) Shucks. Oh, stop. (laughs) Ali : kirk's story is unbelievably inspiring. It explains a lot of why he is the way he is and why he's so positive and just appreciates every day and every moment he's given. Kirk has such strength, and I love that about him. He has a lot of the qualities that I'm looking for In a husband, and that's exciting. I think you're amazing. Being here with you... Makes me feel so good, and I would like nothing more Than for you to accept this rose and stay here with me. I would love to. Yay. Put it on. (laughs) Okay. (laughs) run with it. Oh. Knowing that now I'm invested and emotionally, I am 100% on board with her, Makes me nervous and makes me excited. It makes me want to spend Forever with her. I get so lost in you. It--it feels so good to be me and to let you know who I am, and for you to... Accept it. I don't feel like I've felt this before, and I feel so lucky. (sighs) (speaks indistinctly) ♪ Frank : Kasey. How you doing, man? Kasey's upset. He has to go on this two-on-one with the wrestler, and I think he's really shaken up over that. I think this experience is--is pushing Kasey over the edge. You're not doing well? I don't know, man. I mean, if I'm not here for love, I don't know what I'm here for, 'cause I came here specifically to find love with Ali. I came here for her--for her. I came here to open up... Yeah. To be this. That's who I always have been, that's who I've been. That's who I am in person. That's why I got this tattoo, To be someone... Yeah. And to be a man... Yeah. To be a man for Ali, to be a man for that woman. When are you gonna show her that tattoo? I don't know, man. I mean, like, it's a big thing just because, like, You don't want to keep it from her. I know, but at the same time, it's, like, now it's do or die. I don't NT to be in that situation. I don't want to have a do-or-die situation About, "oh, by the way, check out what I did in New York." I go and I show her on a two-on-one When it's do or die, it just looks like, "oh, he's just making one last attempt to try to stick around." I'm not trying to just stick around. I'm trying to be the man of her dreams. I think this is your time to shine. Send the wrestler home. Send the wrestler back to the ring. (sniffles) Kasey : I want her to fall in love with me. I'm Kasey Kahl. I'm a dreamer. I'm a believer. I love to love. I love to give. I love to share. (sniffles) I've got a tattoo. I can take the physical pain. The physical pain is nothing to me. I like feeling pain. But this emotional pain? I'm tired of it. And if I get sent home, That's gonna destroy me. ♪ (volcano rumbling) (horse snuffles) hey! Today I am taking six guys On an adventure-filled day here in Iceland. Iceland's volcanic, and I think it'd be amazing to explore it. (snuffles) But group dates are awkward. It's always hard who to decide to give the rose to Because I have really strong feelings For a lot of these guys. It's gonna be difficult. Are you ready to meet your friends? Oh. (man speaks indistinctly) (laughs) hi, guys! Ty : Ali looked awesome Sitting there holding eight of these horses. She absolutely looked unbelievable. Saddle up, partner. (laughs) Growing up in the South, I've been on a horse before, So this is right up my alley. I love this type of stuff. You rode a horse before? Ty : yeah. I have never. This is gonna be so much fun. I'm not gonna count my chickens too soon, but I'm definitely, uh, planning on getting that rose. Tight enough? Good? Mm-hmm. Frank : Ty took the lead here. I mean, you know, he's kind of a cowboy. There you go. Put your left foot in and swing your right leg over. Thank you, Ty. He was right at home and, uh, I'm surprised he wasn't tying lassoes and stuff like tha (Ali) all right, let's go! Man : you just gotta-- hey, one with the horse. Ty : you got it. Giddyap! Come on, surefoot. Let's go. Ali : this is so cool. ♪ Ali : oh, my gosh! This is so cool! I'm all about going fast on anything. Roberto : you're, like, a pro. (Ali laughs) that's awesome! Ali has never ridden a horse. And she gets on it, and she's, like, a natural. Whoo! You know what? It's amazing. Everything that she does, she--she's fearless. Whoa. Calm down, buddy. Hey! Hey! (Ali laughs) Hey, hey, hey. Hey. My horse is nuts. Chris l. Is a Massachusetts boy through and through. (laughs) Put him on a wild animal, and he doesn't know what to do. Chris L. : my sadd's falling off, dude. Hey! Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Little help? Little help?! Oh! Ty : Chris hadn't ridden a horse since before. But the horse is pretty tame. They know what to do if you don't spook 'em. So you really couldn't screw it up. Ty : hey, Chris, do you know how to tighten the saddle up? That's what I'm fixin' to do. Chris L. : so then Ty came, 'cause he's a cowboy. I think Ty was born on a horse. He was, like, galloping around like, you ow, Like he can save the world on this thing. So this date was just, like, right up his alley. So I'm not sure where we're going next, but I hope I can impress Ali, whatever it is. Ali : whatever is this? Ty : what the hell? Oh, my gosh. (Ali laughs) Are you kidding? How do you guys feel about going down there? Man : what?! (laughs) Oh, Holy crap. Oh, my gosh. We're fixing to go in this cave. There's no telling what's down there. Ty : I don't know what to expect. Yes, we are on top of a huge cave. Man : like, oh, my God. So we are gonna get strapped up and we're gonna go explore the cave. Chris L. : I was like, oh, jeez. First, horseback riding. Now going into a cave. What's gonna happen next? What, play with snakes? ♪ I've definitely been strategizing. Thinking like, what can I do, you know, To enhance my chance of getting that rose? Kasey has something up his sleeve. And now it's time for me to bring out my ace, and I gotta send him home. (whirring) (crack) Step one is get the cast off. Step two is bye-bye, Kasey. He has his tattoo, but, you know, I took off my cast to have this boot on and it's gonna be a showdown at the o.K. Corral. Man : you walk without crutches. There you go. Bada bing, bada boom. Mission accomplished. This is definitely one small step for Justin and one giant leap for rated-r. Ty : is that tight on your leg? Or you want it tighter? Uh, tighter. Perfect. Ty is just taking the lead and making sure everyone's okay. He helped Chris l. With his saddle. And I just like how he's always caring for me and making sure I'm okay. I love that. Chris L. : yeah. Man : have you done this before? Ali : he's first. Yeah, let's go. I think I'm ready to roll. Yeah, okay. I volunteered to go first 'cause I wanted to get down there right away. Ohh! (Ali laughs) surprise! I was coming next, so you know, I was like, ah, yes! I get some alone time with her at the bottom of this cave. Tell you what. This really hurts the, uh, the little guys down there. Whoa. Even though I'm definitely a little nervous Going down in that hole, I'm gonna man up and, uh, Give it my best shot. You know, do it for Ali. Good. I'm going good. Keep--oh! (grunts) you know what? There's more people here on this date than just Ty. Good! Ali, you coming? I'm ready. Chris l. Was the first one to go down into the cave. (gasps) I'll miss you. Ty : I was a little jealous of that. I, you know, I wanted that time with Ali. (Ali laughs) come on down. Oh, this is awesome! Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh? Ooh! Being alone with Ali at the bottom of the cave Got me excited about being down there. This is her first time doing this as well as mine, So we could kind of share that experience together and that was a cool thing. Ali : my fingers-- I can't even feel them. My fingers are freezing, and Chris l. Just gives me his gloves. And I just thought that was so sweet. Thank you. Mm-hmm. He is making such an effort to just let me know he's there, and I like it. I like him wanting to be close to me. Man : oh, my God. Ah. (Ali laughs) ah! One by one, uh, everyone starts getting lowered down, and now I have to share my time with five other dudes. So that kind of sucks 'cause I just wanted her all to myself. Ali : yay! We all made it! Man : that's it. We all made it in one piece. I say we explore. Man : yeah! Man : that's what I'm saying. Chris L. : right this way, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to caves r" us. Oh, this is sweet! Oh, my God. Ali : be careful! Careful! (laughs) Man : whoa. This thing's huge. Wow. Man : wow. Frank : this is not secure footing. I've traveled halfway around the world now To fall in love with Ali, and I'm on a group date. You know, I'm just a little bummed out. Chris and Ty are competing for her time, and you don't really get the quality time with her That you're looking for. And I've definitely taken a backseat. (squeals) Thank you. Okay. You guys ready? It's just been so great being with all these guys, but hard, too, especially when I have feelings for them and one of them could be my husband. Oh, this is fun. Man : oh. Chris L. : oh, look at that sunset. That's amazing. (laughs) yeah! You know, Ty has been amazing and Craig r. Is just so funny. And so far on this date, Frank has been nonexistent. And you know what? That's his choice. And if he wants to sort of fall behind, Then he can 'cause I have other great guys here  That want to take the time to get to know me. Man : you guys, look at th sunset. You could see this amazing sunset, Like, over the mountains. And I feel better Now that I got a chance to spend some time with Ali. You know, I think I'm gonna get the rose. So all--that's not something I'm gonna worry about 'cause I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get it. Our next stop is a surprise and it'll be much warmer. (laughs) (man speaks indistinctly)so Che. Ty : it seemed like everything went my way today, From the horseback riding to helping people, and I think it made a big impression with her. This has definitely been a dream date for sure. Ali : okay, how we getting out of here? (laughter) Coming up... I don't know about you guys, Ah! Are you kidding?! Sexy like... Yeah. (Craig) she is as hot as I could ever imagine a girl lookg. I've never gotten clothes off so quick in my life. (laughs) Justin : put it this way-- If Kasey's gonna get a rose today, he's gonna earn it Because I'm bringing everything I got. Kasey : I'm expecting that she'll see my heart and see his and choose who I am because I am the better man. And at the end of this whole thing, I'll be sitting there on one knee and she'll tell me, "yes, I do wanna spend the rest of my life with you, Kasey." (volcano rumbling) Today the guys took a little bit of a beating out in the cold, and so did I. So I think we all deserve to relax a little bit. Now we get to go to a place that the guys have never seen before. ♪ Whoo! Ali : all right. Oh! Isn't it amazing? Man : Holy cow. Ty : how cool is this? Ali : the blue lagoon is this Lake That's supposed to have healing properties, and it's pretty magical. This is insane. (laughs) (laughs) I cannot believe this. This is so wild. Frank : Ali brings us  Into the coolest place I've ever been to In my entire life. The air is freezing cold. The water is so hot that the steam is kind of rising off. I can only imagine how amazing this place would be If it was just Ali and I. I don't know about you guys, but I think we should just get in. At do you think? Man : really? Yeah, just go for it. Ty : let's go. Ohh! (laughs) Are you kidding?! (laughs) it was sexy. Huge grins on our faces. I'm ready! Sexy like... Yeah. You guys have suits. They're over there. Man : oh, for real? Go put 'em on and jump in. Oh, my God, it's amazing! She is as hot as I could ever imagine a girl looking. I started stripping down right away. In fact, I almost didn't put my bathing suit on. I've never gotten clothes off so quick in my life. And I was the first one in, so I guess I was a little anxious. (man laughs) feels so good. I saw the rose right off when we got in the lagoon, and I started thinking. I was like, you know, There's a lot of things went my way today. And if I get that one-on-one, I'm sorry. It is game over. (cork pops) Man : champagne! Well, cheers to heating it up in Iceland. Cheers. Yeah. (speaks indistinctly) (laughing) Ty : let me tell you. My ears are freezing. My hair's frozen. I love it! I love it! Chris L. : Ty--seems like he's bringing his a" game. He's got that Southern gentleman hospitality, and it's frustrating. And part of me wishes he was going back to Nashville. Ty, you wanna go explore with me? Absolutely I do. (laughs) let's go. I was waitin'. Chris L. : you know, I can't do anything about Ty Expect to hope that when she spends time with me, It's better than the time she spends with Ty. Ali : you did so well today in your-- Your horse riding skills. I like that you went back and you helped Chris and you helped me, and that was just nice of you. I'm glad you noticed that. Ahh. What has been your favorite part of all this so far? My favorite part? Mm-hmm. This is... (chuckles) (laughs) this is pretty special. This--actually, this is my favorite part right here. Aw. It's like a fantasy world. Being in Ali's arms feels so comfortable, Feels like it's supposed to be. We held each other pretty close for a long time. And, uh, I couldn't have asked for anything more. It was really nice. Tonight, the rose would be pretty phenomenal. Well, I'll have beautiful skin tomorrow. Me, too. (laughs) Yeah. Every time I'm with Chris l., I like him more. But I can't tell if it's really romantic yet. And I feel like The more comfortable we get around each other, The better our relationship gets. So tell me about your past relationships. Um, I think in past relationships, I kinda changed to fit the girl more than just being myself. Mm-hmm. And... Are you doing that now? No, not at all. I'm just being myself and hoping that you like who I am. And-- I like who you are. Yeah? Mm-hmm. That's good 'cause it's who I am. Kissing Ali feels good and I don't want it to stop. And it fee natural and I feel, like, a little cloudy in my head. You know? Like, can't think too early. And my one-on-one time with Ali went really well. I'm trying to get her to see who I am. And if she truly sees who I am, Then she'll fall in love with me and there'll be no competition. You enjoy the place for an instant, and then all of a sudden, Right away, you're consumed with her. Man : yeah. I should be happy but I'm not because Ali's over there. (Ali laughing) Frank : I hate this. The steam is rising from the water, and we couldn't see them. And time's passing. A minute seems like an hour. And it's like, I need to get together with Ali immediately. I know that Ali and I have something special. Group dates don't cut it. You know how to make me happy. Yeah, I-I try. It's driving me insane. Like, I-I'm just-- I'm an emotional disaster right now. (Ali laughing) Kirk : so how's it gonna feel tomorrow... (clears throat) to maybe make sure that Justin has his final match? I don't know what to expect, so I'm just gonna pretend Like he does not exist. The pressure's completely different. This--this whole situation's different. Oh, no, definitely the pressure's on. So you guys can go on, carry on and talk your nonsense. And, uh, kind of hearing that for myself Just made everything a little bit more real for me. You know, and, uh-- See how my hand's kind of, like, twitching a little bit? When that happens, that's when, like, my adrenaline goes. Why you so angry though? I'm not--I'm not gonna-- you know what? You'd be pissed off, too, if you walked into a room and then you went ahead and heard me saying, you know, "Kasey's this. Kasey's garbage, if you ask me." Justin is so full of lies. It's just ridiculous. Who knows what he's gonna do? Who knows? Maybe he'll tell Ali about my tattoo. He's gonna--he's gonna be Shady. Justin's here for himself. He's not here for the reasons of love or for Ali. Gentlemen, I have the card you both have been waiting for. Are you serious? All right. "Kasey and Justin, Let's explore the land of fire and ice." Should be fun. Well, it'll be fun, the moments I spend with Ali. What's made you so confident all of a sudden? Honestly, I think this is just another hurdle. There's gonna be one rose, and the other person's going home. And I'm telling you, that person's not gonna be me. (laughs) 
 
 I cannot believe we're here. Frank : I couldn't wait to get Ali alone. It's just her and I, so far away from the other guys. I think we both look at each other and see a future. We have such a great time. We have a great chemistry. But then we're around other people... I don't even see you on my group dates. I don't even know you exist on them. And I'm always looking for you and I'm like, "where is he?" So tell me, what's up? Well... Honestly. Just be honest. It's a competition for your time, To be next to you. You know, everybody is right there to pounce on When you need a hand. I'm not asking you to push the other guys aside and help me out somewhere. I don't care if any of the guys are. This isn't about them seeing we have something. It's about me knowing we have something. Mm-hmm. That's all I want. I look forward to seeing you. I think about it before I see you. And I feel like I do sort of reach out for you. You do? Mm-hmm. You do. Then you're feeling like I'm not reciprocating? I'm sorry. I feel like the times I get to see you  Are so few and far between at this point That it's really important right now. You're absolutely right. And you do make an effort. And you've done that in certain ways That knocks me off my feet. What Ali's asking for makes perfect sense to me. I need to be here for her, and I need to think about that now. Even if there's a bunch of guys competing for her time, I need to be one of those guys. I came here to fall in love with Ali. I want to be the guy that proposes to Ali, and I want her to say yes" to me. I just hope she'll forgive me. Ali : hi, guys. (Craig) hey. (Ali laughs) Oh, my goodness. (men laugh) Man : are you serving more limes? Man : a frosty rose. Man : oh, boy. It's like the beauty and the beast" rose. Chris L. : it is. Wow. Ty : we're gettin' down to, uh, the nitty-gritty. You know what I mean? There's not many of us left. As far as the rose goes, I'm 100% confident that I'm gonna get the rose. What an amazing day. Seriously... Ty : no doubt. Out in this freezing cold and then the warm spa. It's perfect. Our relationship started off kind of slow, but now we hug and laugh and kissing a little bit. And there's no doubt in my mind I'm getting the rose. I'm, like, 110% sure I'm getting the rose. Ali : tonight, I'd like to give the rose To a guy who, no matter what happened today, There's never been a moment from the beginning of all of this That I felt like this guy wasn't right there when I needed him. Um... (chuckles) So... Ty. Man : Ty! All right. (laughs) (applause) (speaks indistinctly) would you accept this rose? Absolutely. (laughs) Where you gonna put it? (laughing) I know! Ty : thank you so much. The rose today is going to Ty. You know, of course I'm a little bummed I didn't get the rose. And it sucks 'cause I want her all to myself and I'm not gonna stop until that happens. Thank you. It's great. (laughs) I'll take it any way I can get it. It's great. Frank : Ali giving that rose to Ty shows me what I need to do To get the rose next time. It was kind of a wake-up call. I can't sit back and relax Because she could send me home any time she wants. And I gotta fight for her. ♪ Today is huge. Today is a very big day. It's, uh, a day where Either, uh, myself or Justin will go home. What's your game plan in terms of the tattoo? Oh, I'm gonna tell her, you know. It's just--it's just gonna have to depend on The right time and the right place. Today's the day that I'm gonna show her my tattoo. And hopefully she'll see that, you know, My tattoo basically symbolizes everything that I stand for. It stands for, you know, my feelings, my emotions. And hopefully she'll know that everything I do and say is sincere and comes from my heart Because I'm literally putting everything onto my sleeve. (slap hands) So I'll see you tonight, buddy. All right. You know it. But Justin is a snake. He'll be sneaky. He'll be vindictive. You know, it hurts my heart That she hasn't gotten to see, like, who he really is. And I hope Ali can see that. I hope today is the final day Where she finally puts her foot down and says, "kick rocks, dude. You're out of here, wrestler" you seem more confident. How come? Put it this way--if Kasey's gonna get a rose today, He's gonna earn it, and he has to earn it Because I'm bringing everything I got. You know, Kasey did say he's gonna show Ali the tattoo today. And hopefully, you know, it'll work to my advantage, and it's gonna work against him instead of for him. So it's gonna be exciting, it's gonna be thrilling, and, uh, can't wait for it to start. ♪ I have two guys coming on the date with me-- Kasey and Justin--and I only have one rose to give. So that means one guy will be going home tonight. But we're doing some pretty exciting this, and I'm hoping that will sort of take the guys' minds off of... The seriousness of the date. Where are the crutches? No crutches! No crutches! I was like--I'm like, "who is that?" (laughs) (chuckles) Hi, guys! (laughs) good to see you. Finally, I can hug you with two arms. Good! (laughs) oh, how are you, darling? Good. I can't believe you don't have your crutches. Yeah, I know. I'm stoked. I was like, "no, I have to do it before my date tomorrow." Aw! So... The wrestler will probably break his other leg to get a rose. He's that, you know, here for himself. He's not here for Ali. He doesn't care about what he does As long as he's still here putting on a show, 'cause that's what he does. He puts on a show. (Kasey, filtered voice) here we go. Whoo! Oh, my God. Holy (bleep). (laughs) Kasey : I just want Ali to know that I mean what I say. And when I say I mean what I say, Well, I'm proving that I would do anything, Including tattooing my body and go through any amount of pain to find love here with Ali. ♪ (Ali, filtered voice) we are in Iceland, and this volcano is erupting for the first time in 200 years. Oh, wow. And we get to see it from a helicopter. I'm so excited and feel lucky That I'm actually gonna see a volcano. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And I will never see anything like this again. Oh, my God! Look at the volcano! (filtered voice) I know. Wow! That's crazy. This is absurd. (laughs) wow. Ali : you think you know what a volcano's all about, but you don't know. (laughs) You don't know until you're in a helicopter hovering over one. It's super exciting for us to be able to get so close to it. Oh! Oh! Oh! Wow! Wow! Justin : it was amazing and it just started spewing lava. It's just once in a lifetime, and, you know, You have to just sit back and enjoy it. I just wish one thing-- I was the only one in the helicopter with Ali. (Ali, filtered voice) it's just so crazy That it's just two huge extremes here-- The freezing cold weather... Yeah. And then, like, burning hot lava. What do you guys think About getting a little bit closer to that volcano? How close? Like, terrifyingly close. You think you're scared of this helicopter now. But in here. It's about to get a little hot in here. (laughs) Oh! (laughs) Kasey : we were circling around the erupting volcano, and, I mean, I was like, what is going down? This is crazy. I mean, stuff's, like, flying everywhere. And then next thing I know, we're getting closer and closer. I'm like, oh, what?! We're landing this thing? Like, we seriously landed on the volcano. I'm beside myself. You've gotta be kidding me. (laughs) Here we are, boys. Holy (bleep). Stepping off the helicopter onto the volcano is extraordinary. But I have to keep reminding myself There's two guys with me, and one of them is going home. Kasey : you can hear it. Can you guys hear it? I can totally hear it. (Ali laughs) oh! I'd never in a million years Expected to see something like this. Justin : wow, this... I'm looking at this beautiful, captivating volcano That's erupting lava. It's just absolutely amazing. And standing right next to me-- This absolutely beautiful and captivating woman. Tonight is the night that I'm gonna bring home the rose and send the wrestler home for good. That's incredible. This is, like, this is really close. You know, when we were on top of the volcano, I was thinking about the rose, and very slowly inside Kind of a little volcano was brewing because I'd like to think I do have Kasey right where I want him. Like, I want him to doubt everything. I want him to doubt his connection with Ali. I want him to doubt, you know, his strategy going into this. I want him to doubt every single thing about today, and hopefully I'll be the guy to push him over the edge. But this definitely feels just like a wrestling match Where, you know, you pin your opponent, You get the one-two-three count, the bell rings...

(sighs) Today, you know,  Everything that's happened, I realized that is who you are,  And that's so wonderful. And I think you are so ready to meet someone. Mm-hmm. And I think you're gonna give them so much, and I don't wanna hold you back here. I want you to go find her. And I don't want you to change. And I feel... (sniffles) Something just wasn't there. Good luck to you. I hope everything works out, okay? Thanks, Kasey. Oh. ♪ I got the tattoo because I wanted to show her No matter what I say, it's how I feel, and it's genuine. It's just--it's just difficult to--to put that out there and then for her to say, "it's just not good enough." You know, that kind of sucks. I don't wanna continue to keep doing this. I wanna find someone who's gonna be there for me. I just don't know where-- where--where it went wrong. I'm 100% positive that I made the right choice In lting Kasey go today--not only the right choice for me, but the right choice for him. But pulling off in the helicopter and to see Kasey standing on the glacier sucks, and I felt like I-I couldn't... Enjoy my time with Justin Or celebrate with Justin getting a rose Because I just felt so bad about Kasey. But I have to keep thinking That every hard decision that I make is-- I'm one step closer To finding, you know, my guy. ♪ Justin : the bottom line is, what did Ali tell Kasey? "tone it down," and he did the complete opposite. He tonedt up and got himself a tattoo. Kasey's self-destructive and made it easy for me to get a rose. There was actually two roses given-- One to Justin and one to rated-r." (laughs) ♪ 
♪ Ali leaving Kasey on a glacier has definitely Made things seem a little more serious, didn't it? Oh, it's definitely serious now. Do you think he's regreting that tattoo? Kirk : yes. Kasey came, He sang, he got a tattoo, but unfortunately, it was either him or me, and he had to go. (laughs) hi, guys. Hello. Hello. I am looking forward to seeing the guys After a rough date yesterday and letting Kasey go. I'm confident in my decision. I know I'm getting to the right guy, So this is necessary, but it doesn't make it easy. Poor Kasey. I felt so bad. (man chuckles) yeah, I'm like... Ty : left on a glacier. It wasn't good. I didn't feel good. Frank : and with that... May I steal you away? (laughter) Jerk! Awesome. You guys can continue the conversation. It means nothing before. (laughs) good-bye, guys. Frank : on our group date, Ali told me That she would like to see me make more of an effort To be by her side because I've been holding back. So I knew that going into the rose ceremony today, I wanted to be the first guy to talk to her. So how are you? Good. Yeah? Thanks for stealing me. It makes me happy. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Well, you're feeling okay? I was really worried about yesterday and how everyone was gonna react to my choice. I know the guys don't like Justin. I-I know that. He's been nothing but nice to me and said nice things, and I don't know who I'm gonna end up with in the end-- mm-hmm. At the end of all this, you know? But I-I ju-- Mm, I do, but, you know... (laughs) Aw, thank you. Lesson learned on that group date. Like... After you said that, I was like, okay, you are absolutely right. Mm-hmm. Even while we were on the date, I'm like, This is not me. You're a smart girl, and that's one of The most attractive things about you, honestly. Thank you. I like that you think that. Mm-hmm. (exhales deeply) it's good seeing you. God, I miss you every time. I just saw you the other day. I miss you! And you are so good. Mmm. That's that look I miss! That look that you, like, want to be here and you want to be with me. That's what I was missing. I feel like I'm back on track here. Ali and I tonight, we kind of renewed Those feelings that we already felt. I wanna see us fall in love, and I wanna be the last guy here. I'm gonna be completely honest. I am probably as nervous as I've ever been in my entire life. I mean, I could just kind of compare, like, I gave a speech in front of 2,000 or 3,000 people At my law school graduation. I was nervous. I don't think I was this nervous. I've never felt this. It's scary, the fact that somebody's going home tonight. Going home tonight would be like getting the carpet pulled out Right from underneath of me. I don't wanna go home. I wanna be the guy that Win's Ali's heart. I feel like you and I have had not a lot of time together. Mm-hmm. You know? Yeah. A lot of times, I feel that way. Sometimes I like the group dates 'cause I feel like We're all really respectful of one another and-- I love them, too. I'm an expert at them. (laughs) (laughs) Uh, but it's been great. Um.. Mm-hmm. But, you know, I was thinking about it, and I was really thinking that, Even in the short period of time that we've had together, I felt like I wanted to do something To show the way that I'm feeling about you. Mm-hmm. And so I--I got something. Really? Ah. (laughing) And... (chuckles) Uh, Ali with the heart and the rose going through it. (laughing) Uh... (laughs) I-I really hope that you like it. I love it. You do? Uh-huh. All right, good. Good. That was awesome. Thank you for that. I needed that. I think a big surprise for me tonight was Craig r. I wasn't expecting him to just make me laugh and feel so good. And he is great I came into this knowing I needed a guy That would really make me laugh, and I just think he's so funny. If I had to ask you right now one thing That I don't know about you that would surprise me... I would just say--and this is from past relationships-- Like, my long-term girlfriend... Uh, that she's like, "oh, my gosh. Like, you're so funny." Mm-hmm. You know... W-- well, tell me about the fun, silly side of you. What is--what is your guilty pleasure? (laughs) that's a good question. (laughs) I love Mexican food. I don't know. Can I just point out, if you look real quick, She's--she's--Ali's leaning back right now. Like... Frank : Ali's-- They are... Ali's pulling away. Frank : they're 2 1/2 feet apart. (laughs) Roberto : but you know what I'm saying? If we're analyzing their body language, I'm seeing friends. I'm not seeing future husband and wife. They may do brunch once a year. Brunch once a year, just to catch up. You intrigue me and I--and I wanted to know more about you. Aw. Mm. You know, in my opinion, it went well. You know, and it did feel good. It did feel natural. I'm 100% confident That I'm gonna be getting a rose tonight. Hello. Hello. All right. Good talk. Bye. Bye. (chuckles) all right, bye, It takes a little while for some people to warm up and--and put their--put their feelings and thoughts out there. After my last relationship, It was, you know, a hard time in my life with my mom passing. I probably came into this more guarded than most guys, and I still haven't fully opened up to her. You know, so from now on, that's gonna be my priority, Is just to open up more and let her know that When she's looking at a husband, she should be looking at me. So what else do you want to know about me? Oh. (sighs) You're gonna make a big decision, and... I know. And I bet get a rose, so... (laughs) (chuckles) no pressure or anything. Um--and this is okay-- You wanna staylike, in Cape Cod? Um, well, that's the thing is... The most important thing for me is love and family. And I feel like I can do anything or go anywhere, but I just need the person to do that with, you know? Mm-hmm. I don't care where we live or what we do, you know. Uh-huh. I'll collect garbage in San Francisco, you know, If you're the right one for me-- live with you in San Fran. I don't care. And just lots of trips back to Cape Cod to see the family. Oh, God, yeah. Mm. Gotta hang out with the brothers and sisters and Dad, you know. Yeah. You know, my Dad's an awesome guy and, like, he just taught me so much, and I can't wait for you to meet him. Like, he would just--like, I was lucky enough, and my brothers, To grow up in that house and learn from him, like, what an awesome husband is and at an awesome husband should do. And I'm just like, man, if I can just be, like, Half the husband he was for my mom, I'm doing damn good and you're gonna be a lucky lady. You know? Ohh! So... You're so cute. (chuckles) I definitely want a rose tonight Because I love the time that we spend together, Ali and I, and I want more of it, and I don't want it to stop. The two of us are the perfect match for each other. I'm assuming your time went well. Yeah, how did your time go? It seemed--it went really well. But, you know, who actually has Said after coming back from one-on-one time, "my ti went horrible"? Roberto : I still feel like I'm the right guy for Ali. We get along great, but I don't know her connection with other people. I know that mine with her is awesome, and I keep trying as hard as I can Not to think about her making connections with any other guys. I miss you. I missed you. (giggles) You're so cute. Thank you. (kisses) Do you think I'm like people That you would've dated in the past? Would you approach me if you met me out of here? Like, would you try to date me? I'm kind of a shy guy-- not shy. Like, I get along with people really well, but I'm not... I would never have come up to you. Whatever. I never would have. Come up to me? Mm-hmm. Why? Is it just... 'cause I would've thought you were too hot for me. (laughs) Really? I don't believe that. I don't think I'm that hot. (laughs) I really... You are. No, I'm... You're blushing. (laughs) (laughs) well, there you go. Exactly. Mmm. I'm--I'm invested, you know? I've invested my heart. And I think she feels the same way I feel about her, So hopefully she gives me a rose and I can continue traveling the world with her, and hopefully it ends up with the last rose. (clinks glass) sorry to break up the party, Ali, but it is time for the rose ceremony. So if you would, come join me. Frank : I need the rose because I need to be here. I have faith that if I stick through this, Ali and I will be together in the end. (Craig) I'm nervous tonight Because I am less and less sure that I'm getting a rose. There are five people here-- they're all good guys, and I do believe in my heart that there'll all here for Ali. And one of those guys is gonna go home tonight. Justin's gonna stay in their place. I think that's a shame. ♪ 
♪ Well... Before we talk about tonight, what's going on... Mm-hmm. I wanna talk about just being here in Iceland. Yeah. Iceland is insane. I'm experiencing things here That I never thought I'd get to see. It's just-- it's extraordinary. One of the toughest things abt this week Was the two-on-one date. Mm-hmm. Kasey--let's talk about, you know, Thtattoo, guarding your heart. And what was you take on all that? I think Kasey fell in love With the idea of falling in love here. Okay. Because I think he really sort of made himself believe He was maybe falling for me, but I just wasn't feeling it on my end, and it didn't feel good. But I know my decision to send Kasey home was the right one-- Not only best for me but I really feel like it's what was best for him. Let's talk about tonight. It's another rose ceremony. Uh, one of these gentlemen that you've gotten to know very well is gonna be going home. Mm-hmm. Are you ready? I feel like I've gotten to a really good place With most of the guys, but I've been Sort of pinching myself, saying, Am I being honest with myself about everything? Yeah. If the guy that's meant for me is here. But I really have a lot of faith that he is. And this week, I feel like there's a few guys That I think I could end up with. But, you know, there's still a little something That I feel like is holding me back. Can I play armchair psychiatrist for a second? Sure. I think you're afraid to let yourself fall in love. ♪ I am going to be very cautious of... Who I give my heart to. I don't want to get hurt, either. What are you so afraid of? You know, this is hard, and when I'm letting someone go on a two-on-one date, and when I'm letting one guy go in a rose ceremony, I don't feel good, and there's been a lot of instances That I don't feel good so far. And the only thing that's keeping me going is the belief That I'm gonna end up with someone at the end of this. Yeah. And if I don't... (sighs) I don't know. I am almost positive I'm gonna fall in love here... Mm-hmm. And I am terrified I won't be loved back. You know you can't... Go through this With that fear. You have to let it go. I know. I think I'll get there. I just think there's still some relationships I have here  That are st of iffy. Like, will we get there? Yeah. I think w--hopefully, I'll get to a point Where I have guys here that were there, were all there. And then I'll feel more confident then. I think you will. I think if you trust yourself, That you'll know when you get to that point. I think you're right. All right, well, I look forward to that point, but you also have a tough job to take care of tonight. Mm-hmm. All right, so you're sending one of these gentlemen home. Think about what you wanna say. And when you're ready, I'll see you down there. Okay? Thank you, Chris. All right. Oh! Oh! See you down there. I'm not here to date eight guys. I'm here to find the one. But I'm afraid that I'm gonna keep someone around That's just gonna break my heart in the end. But tonight, I'm realizing more now than I ever have  That I want love above all things. And I'm gonna be strong By being open and being vulnerable. I just need to love more, and I need to trust my gut and my instincts and not let fear be such a controlling factor in my life. ♪

I had to send him home-- just him alone. It's heartbreaking. I tried so hard to see if something could be there, If I could learn something about him, and... I just couldn't get there with him, and I think he knows that. ♪ Chris N. : kind of at a loss for words, to be honest. I don't know. I-I'm a little shattered by this whole thing. I think I had a lot of qualities to bring to her. She did miss out on a lot of things about me. I think those are things that you earn with trust over time. ♪ Had I stuck around, maybe I would've Come out of my Shell a little bit more. And, uh, maybe she would've made a different decision in the end. You know, it's something for sure I'll have a little bit of regret on. Um...
