 Tonight on... 
 The Bachelorette Guys, welcome to Vegas! 
 Whoo! 
 Man : - Oh, my God. 
 Oh! (Ashley) I feel like the luckiest person in the world. 
 Man : To share that moment with Ashley... 
 I mean, that's a once-in-a-lifetime thing. 
 Ashley : Oh, my God! 
 Man : This is the kind of date that you marry that person. 
 You think this is too much for the first date? 
 This is... this is a little fast, yeah. 
 (Ashley laughs) Son, are you... are you ready for this? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 William, will you take this woman to be your wedded wife? 
 Who do you think's going home? 
 Man : - Jeff. 
 Jeff. 
 He said if he got some decent one-on-one time, he was gonna reveal himself. 
 Wouldn't it be funny if she asked him to put it back on? 
 (Jeff) This is serious, and this isn't a joke. 
 I-I think I'm finally ready to take this thing off. 
 I would love it if you would. 
 Okay. 
 Ashley : - I feel something for you. 
 (Bentley) - I'd be lying to everyone if I'm like, yeah, I'm in this, like, till the end. 
 There's no way I'm gonna last that long. 
 She's just not my type. 
 Oh, Bentley, Bentley, Bentley. 
 (Bentley) She just has a great body, she has an amazing butt, and having her tickle my... (Bleep) 
 I mean, that would be amazing. 
 Ashley : I'm seeing such sincerity in him, but in my heart, I really feel something really strong. 
 He could be the one for me. 
 It's all coming up on... 
 The Bachelorette ♪ 
♪ 
♪ 
 Hey, guys. Come on into the living room. 
 (Men cheering) 
 All right, let me tell you what's going on. 
 Each week, you'll be going on dates with Ashley. 
 There will be group dates, there will be individual dates. 
 On each date, there will be a rose up for grabs. 
 If you get that rose, you're safe for the next rose ceremony, nothing to worry about. 
 Now the individual date... 
 A little more complicated. 
 If Ashley decides to not give you a rose on that date, you'll be going home immediately, so before that date, you gotta have your bags packed because you may not be coming back to the mansion. 
 All right? 
 Now as for the dates... 
 Who goes on 'em, where you'll be going... 
 You'll find out as your date cards arrive. 
 I have your first one right here. 
 So... enjoy the mansion, enjoy the dates, and I hope to see all of you at the next rose ceremony, all right? 
 Men : Thanks, Chris. 
 I think it's a huge advantage to have the first one-on-one date. 
 Spending actual quality time really kind of away from everybody else is huge. 
 Men : - Ames. 
 I'll do the honors. 
 I think Ashley is absolutely beautiful, and I would love to have a one-on-one date with her. 
 (Clears throat) 
 "William, "want to make a splash in Vegas? 
 I do. Love Ashley." 
 (Men laugh) 
 Yes. 
 I have mixed emotions right now. 
 I'm really excited, but I'm also really nervous. 
 I just hope that I don't blow it. 
 Man : Vegas... pretty amazing. 
 I know. Wow. And I'm also... 
 We're sure not going to Vegas. 
 I think we all are a little bit surprised and jealous at the same time that he got first round with Ashley. 
 What do you think that means? 
 What do you think splash"... 
 I-I hope that it's not, like, a race or anything. 
 Everything could be over. 
 Be taking him off, they go in the little chapel of love in Vegas, and it's just done. Man! 
 That would be terrible. 
 Hope you don't come back. 
 Man : All right.

 Ashley : I'm so excited to be the Bachelorette, especially after the first night, seeing how great the guys are and how amazing of an experience this is. 
 I think I got really lucky. 
 I think I have some of the best-looking guys that have ever been here. 
 I have a lot of confidence going into this week, but there's a small part of me that worries that I'm gonna fall for somebody, and they're not gonna feel the same way. 
 This is a two-way street. 
 The guys have to pick me, too. 
 I want to be with somebody that wants to be with me as well. 
 First date... I'm so excited. 
 I think I'm gonna have a really good time with William today. 
 I know that he'll make light of any situation, so I think he's the perfect guy to go on this first date with. 
 Man : - So what's the game plan? 
 Ashley : - Hey, guys! 
 Man : - Whoa! 
 Man : - Wow! 
 What's up? 
 Man : - How you doing? 
 It's so good to see you guys in normal clothes. 
 (Matt) Ashley... she's sizzling. 
 She's boiling today, she was so hot. 
 I think every single guy in the house... like, you just saw heads pan, jaws drop. 
 Are you excited for our date? 
 I'm really excited about our date. 
 Ashley : - You look cute. 
 I want to kill William at this point. 
 Man : - She's driving? 
 I'm driving. 
 Why am I not going on this date? 
 She looks so good. I want to sweep her off her feet, drop her in the car, we just take off for Vegas right there. 
 She looked awesome. 
 (William) - Good luck with all the guys. 
 Man : Don't bother bringing him back. 
 Well, we're driving all the way to Vegas, so... 
 I could do that. I like to drive. 
 I love driving. 
 I'm ecstatic to look in the rearview mirror and just see all the guys get further away. 
 Oh, my gosh. You see that little plane? 
 We're taking a private jet? 
 I was thinking that we were just gonna drive all the way to Vegas. 
 (Ashley laughs) 
 It's something that you only see in movies, and for us to hop in and just take off to Vegas, uh, awesome. 
 There's all the other guys in the mansion down there. 
 (Chuckles) - Can you see? They're waving. 
 They're w... they're waving. "Bye, Ashley!" 
 Bye. Have fun in L.A. 
 (Laughs) 
 (Jeff) I'll admit it. 
 I'm envious of William. 
 I'm excited to go out with her for the first date. 
 The second date. 
 Well,  my  first date with her. 
 Yeah. 
 When is the mask coming off? 
 I'm definitely gonna reveal my face on  my  first date with Ashley. 
 With me coming in the house with this mask on, I've taken the stealth approach, and I feel like a lot of the guys are just riding around in cabs. 
 So I feel like I can stay high up above and just kinda watch down below and see what's kinda happening, you know, that's just my style, I guess. 
 Now that we're in 90-degree weather... do you wish you wore a white mask? 
 Yeah, I wish I actually had a white mask. Yeah.

 We're in Vegas, baby! 
 (Laughs) (William) Even though it's my first date with Ashley, it doesn't feel like it's our first date. 
 She makes me feel extremely comfortable. 
 (Singsongy) - It's gonna be awesome! 
 There's a rose at stake at the end of this date, and I have to get this rose. 
 I have to win her heart. 
 (Speaks indistinctly) Aah! 
 As soon as we get out of the limo... 
 Man : - Ashley! 
 (Camera shutters click) 
 People were all over her. 
 Ashley's like a celebrity out there. 
 I'm so happy that you're the new Bachelorette. 
 I'm so so happy for you. 
 I am, too. I am, too. 
 I know. I'm extremely happy that she's the next Bachelorette. 
 And people were crowding us. 
 We both felt like a celebrity couple, and it just felt like we always have been. 
 So is he the one? 
 (Laughs) 
 (Singsongy) We'll find out! We'll see! 
 Ashley : One of my fears coming here was that these guys were not actually here to get married. 
 You know, at the end of this journey, I'm hoping that it takes me to the altar. 
 I'm not sure if William's ready to go quite yet, so today I'm gonna put William to the test.

 So... 
 Oh. Some... some cake? 
 What do you think? 
 (William) She pulls me into a cake shop, and you can tell that these were wedding cakes. 
 It's, like, our wedding cake. 
 So I was... well, that was my line, and you just stole it. 
 At this point in time, I'm thinking that she just was hungry. 
 She was starving for dessert. 
 So I just kinda went with it. 
 Uh... 
 (Laughs) 
 Little nervous. 
 Making me a little nervous with the wedding theme. 
 (Giggles) 
 (Gasps) 
 (He laughs) 
 Ashley : This is not cute. 
 (Laughs) 
 Nice. Yeah, we'll take that cake. 
 We'll take... (Laughs) 
 Okay. 
 (William) We did settle on a cake for the wedding. 
 I can't wait to see what happens next. 
 Hi. 
 How can I help you? 
 We're here to get a ring. 
 (Laughs) 
 Well... 
 I-I've never looked at rings for a girl. 
 I didn't know if I should turn around and maybe go eat more cake instead. 
 When's the big day planned for? 
 Uh, we're shooting for next summer. 
 (Laughs) I thought we're doing it tonight. 
 Oh, well, the official one. 
 I mean... since we're in Vegas, We're thinking about maybe doing it tonight. 
 That's what a lot of people do. 
 This is a 2-karat cut diamond. 
 That is  beautiful. 
 Do you have any idea what your size is? 
 No, not at all. 
 I've never worn a ring. 
 That's about to change, baby. 
 I'm getting really nervous, 'cause we just keep inching closer to the process of finalizing a marriage. 
 (Organ playing Mendelssohn's "Wedding March") 
 (William) I'll get the door. 
 (Ashley laughs) 
 Hi. Nice to meet you. William. 
 William William Holman. 
 I'm Ashley. 
 Ashley. 
 Soon to be holman. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 You know, to me, it's a joke. 
 It's a joke. It's a joke. 
 It's not... it's not gonna happen. 
 That's what I kept thinking to myself, and then the minister came back in his full robe, and I was (Bleep) Nervous. 
 (Chuckles) 
 I was (Bleep) Scared when he walked back in, I'll be honest. 
 Son, are you... are you ready for this? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 We'll, uh, we'll find out. 
 Yeah? 
 I'm... I'm still nervous. 
 Well, just breathe and don't lock your knees, and we'll get you through it. 
 Thank you. Good advice. 
 Okay. Marriage is a huge step in life. 
 That's not something that you take for granted. 
 But, you know, Ashley is definitely the kind of girl that any guy would love to marry. 
 (Pachelbel's "Canon in D" playing) 
 Where's your bouquet? 
 Oh, yeah, that's true. 
 (Record needle scratches) Wait. Wait. 
 Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Here. And you hold on to that. 
 All right. 
 You good? All right. 
 Okay, let me... let me do a couple steps with my bouquet. 
 You... yes. 
 (Pachelbel's "Canon in D" resumes playing) 
 (Laughs) Look at this. 
 We'll set this down and get it out of your way. 
 This is yours, though. 
 (Laughs) - Oh, my God. 
 Face me, please. Would you face me? 
 Oh. 
 Okay. It's okay to... 
 It's okay to hold hands. 
 You know each other. Okay, good. 
 Very well. 
 William, will you take this woman, whose hand you hold, choosing her alone to be your wedded wife, will you love her, comfort her, honor her at all times, and be faithful to her? 
 (Laughs) 
 (Laughs) I do. 
 (Laughs) 
 Ashley : Oh, my goodness! 
 I did not think William would actually go through with this. 
 What do we do now? This could be a legally binding marriage. 
 And, Ashley, will you take this man, whose hand you hold, to be your wedded husband... 
 Do you live with him, comfort him, honor him at all times, and be faithful to him? 
 If we go through with this, we're gonna be legally married. 
 I still have 17 other guys to consider. 
 I can't get married yet. 
 (Laughs) (Laughs) 
 Babe? 
 (Laughs) 
 I will eventually, but just not at this moment. 
 You're so sweet. 
 I can't believe that you... you said that. (Laughs) 
 It was the cutest thing ever. 
 Maybe we'll eventually do this, but down the road. 
 What do you think? 
 This is the best first date I've ever been on. 
 Is it? It's my best first date, too. 
 (Laughs) 
 Seriously. 
 Seriously. 
 William, uh, you may kiss your almost-bride. 
 (Gasps) Oh! 
 One of my fears coming here was that these guys aren't here for me, but he made me feel so comfortable, we had a great time, so any fear that I had about that was immediately put to rest. Oh, my gosh. 
 We almost got married! (Laughs) 
 I know it's really soon to say this, but I am definitely falling for William, after  half  of a date. 
 I can't believe I just said that. 
 Let's go. Aah! 
 Hey. All right, you have to pick me up. 
 Whoa! (Laughs)

 I had so much fun today. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. It was an amazing, amazing first date. 
 I cannot believe how well this date is going with William. 
 The date is only halfway over, and I feel like he could be somebody that I could spend a really long time with. 
 Isn't it beautiful out here? 
 This looks amazing out here. 
 I feel like the beginning part of the day won the rose, but it's up to the last part of the night to see if I keep it. 
 So I'm so excited to tell you that we're doing something that nobody's ever done before. 
 We're gonna have dinner right out there. 
 On the water? 
 Yes. 
 Wow. And how are we getting there? 
 In that. 
 A rowboat? 
 Yes, a rowboat. 
 Let's get down there. 
 I'm... I'm excited. 
 And you're rowing, right? 
 (Laughs) Uh, I don't know about that. 
 This is so incredible. 
 These are the famous Bellagio fountains. 
 It's kind of romantic, don't you think? 
 Kind of? This is insane. 
 Ashley : Millions of tourists come to Vegas just to see this, and here we are, rowing right in the middle of them. 
 I hope they don't go off. 
 To see Vegas from this standpoint... 
 I know! 
 Like... 
 Isn't it beautiful? 
 How many people have dinner in the water and they have everybody just watching you? 
 Nobody gets to do this kind of thing. 
 And to do that with her, uh, just... breathtaking. 
 I am so glad you're here. 
 I feel like a million bucks. 
 Women : - We love you, Ashley! 
 (Laughs) Thanks, guys. 
 Woman : - You look beautiful tonight. 
 Thank you. 
 So many women love you. 
 Yeah, I know. I hope some men love me, too. (Chuckles) 
 You know? (Laughs) 
 As much as I love how fun and outgoing he is, I'm looking for somebody that's serious, and I hope that William can bring that tonight, 'cause that's very important to me. 
 I want to know about what you did after high school. 
 Did you go to school? Did you not? Did you start working? 
 I didn't go to school. 
 I was working right away. 
 Okay. 
 And I'm in sales. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not a doctor. 
 I don't save lives. 
 I don't need you... I don't you to be that. 
 I-I bring communication to people. 
 I want you to be you. That's what I want. 
 I like that. 
 I am me. I've always wanted to be a stand-up comedian. 
 That's what I've always wanted to do. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I think you'd be really good. 
 So I mean, I do want you to see a serious side of me, though. 
 Yeah. 
 And I do want you to know that family is a very important thing to me, and I have my mom, my sisters, but, uh, the one person that meant a lot to me growing up... I lost my Dad, you know, close to six years ago, to alcohol. 
 And, you know, his morning started with drinking and the morning ended with drinking, and that's all that he got to know. 
 It was so hard for me to see what he had to go through. 
 I got a phone call that... 
 He had, uh... 
 He was left by the side of the road, beaten. 
 Oh, my God. 
 And if you're not ready to hear this... no, no, no, no. 
 That... I know I  want  to hear it. 
 It's just... it hits closeto home for me. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, I went right back to the I.C.U., and that, you know, that was... that was the last time I ever talked to him. 
 I fell apart that night and didn't know what to do with myself. 
 And the next morning I woke up, and I looked at my watch, and it was set to the time of day that he passed. 
 What? 
 And I've kept my watch set to that time and day... 
 No. 
 Since then, and it's always a reminder to... to tell myself to keep going and don't let my time stop. 
 Don't let my life burn out, you know? 
 I'm shaking right now. 
 You don't even know. 
 This, like, really hits close to home. 
 I've been through that my whole life with my father. 
 Um, he's a... 
 He's an alcoholic. 
 And it's been an ongoing life struggle. 
 Hearing that William has kind of shared the same emotions that I've had in my childhood makes me feel closer to him. 
 It makes me feel like there's so much more to this person than I thought two hours ago. 
 (Knock on door) 
 Man : Got a knock at the door. 
 (Blake) Let me... 
 Let me check that out. 
 Man : Oh, no. 
 (Cheering) All right, guys. 
 Looks like we got a date card. 
 (Jeff) I'm really looking forward to my first date with Ashley so I can reveal who I really am on the inside and outside. 
 Ashley will definitely be, uh, pleasantly surprised. 
 I know she will fall in love with me. 
 Here we go. 
 Constantine... 
 Oh! 
 Ryan M., Chris, Ben F., Nick, Bentley, West, Lucas, Stephen, Blake, Matt, and Ames. 
 Man : - Wow. 
 Whoo! 
 It says, "in sin city, boys will be boys. 
 Love, Ashley." 
 Man : - We're going to Vegas! 
 Everyone's going to Vegas. 
 We're all going. 
 Man : - Whoo! 
 If you're not going to Vegas, stay standing, 'cause I wanna see this. 
 (Man chuckles) 
 Man : Sit. 
 So the five of us... what does that mean? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm not quite sure how I feel. 
 Yeah, I don't know.

 In you, I see everything. 
 I want to give you this rose, and I really, really hope that you accept it. 
 I... I accept the rose. 
 Will you accept the rose? 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 You scared me.

 Ashley : After this first night with William, I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. 
 I'm holding on to this date, and I'm, like, locking it up in my memory box. 
 I feel like the bar is set so high for all my other dates. 
 I don't know if any other guy can be as great as William. 
 I'm so happy right now. 
 I want to do everything that I can to make you this happy all the time.

 Two crews, but one crew is gonna rock the show with us, and the other crew is gonna be on a plane back home to Los Angeles. 
 I'm not going back to L.A. 
 I'm  not  going home. I'm  not  going home.

 I've been waiting for my moment. 
 Now it's my time to shine. 
 Vegas, baby. 
 Being on a group date and knowing you're gonna be vying for her attention... 
 There are some guys that are gonna be cutthroat. 
 Las Vegas, here we come. 
 And I'm gonna make sure it's clear to her that I'm somebody that should be around.

 William has certainly moved very high, and I would consider him a front-runner at this point. 
 But today I'm gonna be juggling 12 guys. 
 Instead of going back to L.A., I thought it'd be a great idea to fly all of the boys out here to Las Vegas to do something that we could only do here. 
 Man : Wow! She looks unbelievable. 
 (Laughs) But I have no idea how I'm gonna handle this many men. 
 Hey! 
 Hey, Lucas! 
 How are you, sweetie? 
 You look amazing. 
 Hey! How are you? 
 Man : - Oh, man. 
 I'm sort of nervous going into this group date... 
 Hey, West. 
 To begin with, because I've ever been to Vegas before, so I don't know what to expect... 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! Whoo! 
 But that's only magnified by the fact that I'm with 11 other guys. 
 I hope to kinda stand out just by really putting myself out there, and I'm gonna have fun with it, and I hope she sees that. 
 Today I have a very active date planned for the boys. 
 Right down here. 
 I'm really putting them on the spot, testing their ability to move, if you know what I mean. 
 Ashley : Come on, guys.

 Man : Yeah! 
 Whoo-hoo-hoo! 
 All right, guys, so now that you've seen the fabulous jabbawockeez, we are gonna be rehearsing with them. 
 Man : - Oh, jeez. 
 Man : - Whoo! 
 I'm freaking out. I am not a dancer. Not even close. 
 So right now we're gonna break you up into two crews of six. 
 So first off, we've got Bentley. 
 I love dancing, but it's not something that's a make-or-break deal for a guy. 
 Over here. You're team "B". 
 If he can't dance and he tries, I think it's really cute... 
 Here we go. Let's bring it. 
 But if he can dance, you know what that means... 
 Good times on the dance floor. 
 So now that we broke you guys up into two crews, what we need you guys to do is come up with your own routine with your crew. 
 What we emphasize is style, synchronicity, and showmanship... 
 However you guys decide to do that is up to you. 
 And we have one spot open tonight where one crew is gonna be able to stay and rock the show with us, live onstage, in front of a packed house, and the other crew is gonna be on a plane back home to Los Angeles. 
 So do your best. May the best crew win. Good luck. 
 No pressure, guys. 
 No pressure. (Laughs) 
 Chris : I'm feeling a little nervous. 
 Lets us know that this has turned into a competition. 
 Going down. 
 (Speaks indistinctly) 
 Six of us are gonna go home. 
 I'm a horrible dancer. 
 Not a good feeling. 
 How many guys we got? Six? 
 Man : - We got six. 
 We went backstage and we just started brainstorming. 
 We have about 30 minutes to come up with a choreographed routine. 
 I had no clue what we were doing. 
 Let's have, like, two guys up front that are, like, down low. 
 Six guys are gonna stay. 
 Six guys are gonna go. 
 If you win the competition, you get to stick around and spend time with Ashley, and you're cutting the... the group of guys in half. 
 Different that way? Is that any better? 
 It looks, uh... 
 Still kinda weird? 
 Yeah, it doesn't look good at all. 
 Okay. 
 It's very important that we win this challenge, but there's no real concept as of yet, and it's still early on, but I've got an idea that I think might change that. 
 We should kind of emulate, you know, a rose ceremony of sorts. 
 That's good. I like this. 
 We need to be around her, surrounding her. 
 I wanna live it up in Las Vegas, tonight, with Ashley. 
 How long are you guys gonna go before he comes? Any more? 
 As soon as Ashley does her thing, the next guy goes. 
 I'm hoping that our little rose ceremony will sort of subliminally send a message to Ashley that she should give me the rose tonight. 
 I get to end it dancing pretty close to her, and I feel pretty great about that. 
 Because not all of us, including me, are very strong dancers... 
 Man : Yeah. Why don't we stage some type of wedding ceremony? 
 Yes, done. 
 You could be, like, the priest. 
 You could be, like the priest. 
 You could stand there and you could be, like, just doing the book or whatever. 
 I came up with this idea about doing kind of a choreographed wedding. 
 How's it going, guys? 
 (Ryan M.) We may need, uh, we may need a bride. 
 Stephen was the groomsman, and Ames was the priest. 
 We had this little routine where we came down the aisle. 
 Oh! 
 Throw the flowers out. 
 What up? 
 And the whole theme was basically a bride never shows up. 
 And I just get crushed in the heart, and I just go like this and I just go down. 
 I get stood up at the altar. I break down. 
 All the best men around me console me. 
 (Laughs) 
 Guys, that's really good! 
 We end up with Ashley running in a little late. 
 Oh, come in and then tap you? 
 And, uh, they end up falling in love, I guess. 
 We need to come up with a crew name. 
 What is it? 
 (Matt) What about... what about chapelwockeez? 
 Chapelwockeez? 
 No, no. Think of something, like, with the wedding, wedding theme. 
 (Ames) - The Best Men? 
 The Best Men. The Best Men. The Best Men. 
 The Best Men... I like that. 
 (Blake) - What's our crew name gonna be? 
 Something with rose" in it, probably. 
 Man : - Oh, yeah. That's... 
 No Rhythm Nation? 
 Man : - No Rhythm Nation? 
 That's pretty good. (West) Yeah. 
 All I'm thinking is I'm not going back to L.A. 
 I mean, I don't care what we have to do, we're staying. 
 The mask, dude. This is coming out tonight, dude. 
 Hopefully we'll be wearing this tonight, and I'll just... got the beat going, you know, and just winning it. 
 If you win this dance-off, you get to spend so much more time with Ashley. It's... it's crucial. 
 We're not going back to L.A. 
 We are  not  going home. 
 I am  not  going home. 
 And then we'll leave. 
 All right. Perfect. 
 Let's do it. 
 Cool? All right. 
 Honestly, I think our team's pretty money. 
 Losing is not an option. No Rhythm Nation's in it to win it. A lot of pressure, men. 
 This is spending the night in Vegas tonight. 
 Hang out with Ashley after, we go back to Los Angeles. 
 If we win this competition right now, we're staying in Vegas tonight. 
 We're partying with our girl. 
 (All) - Best Men! 
 We're gonna give it our all in this competition. 
 May the best men win. 
 It's a shorter flight home, buddy. 
 Feel that popping in your ears? 
 That's the altitude from your plane ride home. 
 Ooh!

 (Laughs) (Ben F.) 
 They still have three and one. 
 Is that a manly high five or... 
 I felt confident going in. 
 Man : Oh, she's late. 
 She stood you up. 
 I felt even more confident after seeing the other team's dance. 
 Man : - Ah! 
 Man : - Oh! 
 Uh-oh! Oh! 
 Wow! 
 Man : - Whoo! 
 (Laughs) 
 Not done. 
 (Laughs) (Bentley) The other team's done. 
 They don't have a chance. 
 The execution was poor, to say the least. 
 Hug was off. 
 The whole thing looked pretty bad. 
 Suckers. 
 Next up, we got No Rhythm Nation. 
 Man : You guys better hurry. 
 You got a plane to catch. 
 Man : Now boarding gate 8. 
 Fire up the bus, boys. 
 No Rhythm's going home. 
 Man : - Oh! 
 (Stephen) - She's struttin'. 
 Man : - Oh! Oh! 
 (Constantine) - We got this. 
 Watching the other team, I'm thinking, like, no way these guys are staying here. 
 Man : - Oh, she's great.

 Men : Oh! 
 Man : Swag. Swag. 
 That might kill it. 
 That might seal it, though. 
 No way, bro. 
 (Stephen) No Rhythm Nation definitely one-upped us in having Ashley in the whole routine. 
 She's the reason why we're here. 
 Man : - Get that. You get that. 
 (Ryan M.) - Can't even watch that. 
 Men : - Oh! 
 Man : Ooh! 
 Man : - He took your girl. 
 Ouch. 
 I felt good about our performance, I was proud of what we did, but I wasn't positive, at that point, we were gonna be staying in Sin City. No Rhythm Nation, you guys had some cool highlights in your guys' show as well as Best Man Crew. 
 We loved both of your guys' shows. 
 It was, uh, it was kind of hard to make a decision, but... we had to, uh, run with one crew, so, uh, Best Man Crew, you guys... 
 Will not be rocking with us tonight. Oh! 
 (Men cheering) 
 All right. 
 With that being said, No Rhythm Nation graduated to Almost Rhythm Nation. 
 Yeah! 
 To be in Vegas, on a stage with the jabbawockeez, and then after that, to go spend all this extra time with Ashley? Phenomenal. 
 We'll miss you. 
 I'll see you. 
 It's really hard to see The Best Men leave tonight. 
 There are a few guys in there that I really wanted to sit down and talk to. 
 You guys were awesome. You guys really were. 
 We're not gonna get a date with Ashley tonight. 
 It was just, like, instantly, like, just sucked the wind out of you. 
 (Ben F) - Having less guys here competing for Ashley's attention is wonderful. 
 (High-pitched voice) Later! 
 Man : Sorry, playboys. 
 (Stephen) I'm bummed out. 
 I'm definitely heavy-hearted. 
 I'm upset that we're going back home and I'm not gonna be able to spend any time with Ashley. 
 Man : I thought we at least had the best concept, man, um... 
 Man : - It hurts. 
 Man : Yeah. So you guys gotta get ready. 
 We got three hours. 
 You guys are gonna be performing in front of a couple thousand people right here. 
 Peace out, Vegas. 
 (Matt) We were all pretty down. 
 We just blew that opportunity. 
 We're headed home, and six other guys that we just lost the competition to are having a group date with Ashley, spending more time with her, building a connection possibly, and, you know, they're gonna earn themselves maybe a rose. 
 (Woman speaks indistinctly over P.A.) 
 (Ames) Ashley's gonna spend the evening with these guys, performing, doing what she loves... dancing... 
 Ho ho ho! Yes! 
 And that's upsetting. 
 Chris : I'm sitting on a plane while they're getting ready for a night in Vegas with Ashley. 
 (Tires screech) 
 Yeah! Back in L.A.! 
 I wanna throw myself in the engine right now. 
 We put our best foot forward, yeah. Who gives a (Bleep)?

 Man : - Hey! 
 Whoa! Whoa! 
 They're back! 
 Man : - Look at these guys! 
 I'm pretty surprised to see half the guys show up. 
 Where... six? 
 We got sent home early. 
 And the guys that are here right now are pretty deflated. 
 We... we were in Vegas for less than eight hours. 
 So what are those guys doing? 
 They're performing tonight. 
 And you guys got sent home? Ha! 
 Yeah, we were in the airport... 
 We were in the airport longer than we were in Vegas, basically. 
 They're there, and you guys got sent back.

 Yeah. Yeah.

 We freaking had so much fun. 
 Did you? 
 (Lucas) - It's a good crew right here. 
 Man : - We had a lot of fun. 
 I'm really glad that you guys are here, all six of you. 
 There's really limited time in all this, so I almost want to treat tonight as individual one-on-ones. 
 (Mouth full) - Fair enough. 
 Wanna get down and dirty with the facts. 
 (Laughs) (Man) - Dirty, dirty details. 
 With that being said... 
 Yeah. 
 Can I have a minute? 
 Whoa! Sure. 
 We all want to get that rose. 
 Yeah, we were a team onstage, but now it's every man for himself. I just want her to know that I'm better than every other guy. 
 I'm really glad that you pulled me aside, because I was thinking about this today. 
 When I was watching you guys practice, I thought I saw so much of myself in you. 
 I think a lot of dentists have very similar personalities. 
 So I'm wondering would it be... 
 I think... two really type "A" personalities, you know, butting heads? 
 You're looking for someone that likes order and precision. 
 I imagine that's how you operate. 
 Yeah, I'm a perfectionist. 
 I'll tell you that. 
 Mm-hmm. So it would be twice as perfect. 
 (Ashley laughs) - Oh, that was good. 
 What are you saying that's so funny? 
 Ashley did say she really wanted to get to know us tonight, and if you're gonna get to know me, one of the biggest parts of that is my past... 
 The fact that I  was  married and the fact that my wife passed away. Gents. 
 I've had a couple of girls that I dated since Sarah passed away that didn't respond particularly well to my situation, and so that's a worry for me. 
 
 
 
 Hey, West. 
 Mind if I talk to you for a minute? 
 No problem. 
 I hope Ashley will understand why I'm a little more reserved sometimes. 
 So tell me something about you, 'cause I'm... I'm dying to know, learn about you. 
 I want you to know that I'm absolutely 100% here for you, like, I'm... I'm in it. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 There have been some things in my past that have led me to be a little more reserved and closed off. 
 It's hard for me to open up to people sometimes. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (Whispers) Well, here goes. 
 You're scaring me. Okay. 
 (Normal voice) It's... it's, uh, I'm sorry. 
 It's... it's a little tough to talk about, but, um... - No, it's okay. 
 Uh, I was married before and, um... 
 Really? 
 I was, and, um, I met Sarah when I was 20 and when she was 18, and we were together for about seven years total. 
 And, uh, we were married for about nine months before she passed away. 
 It was... the hardest thing that I've ever gone through. 
 Um... 
 Pretty heavy. 
 Yeah, I'm sorry. I really... 
 No, I-I mean, I want to hear this, and I want to know what you've been through. 
 I mean being here is a huge deal for me... 
 Mm-hmm. Huge step. 
 Because I, uh, because I'm ready to put myself back out there. 
 I'm ready to... to fall in love again. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 But it's still... it's a big step. 
 After the fact, you know, a couple of years removed, I was sort of able to learn from it and realize that you don't know when the people that you love are gonna be taken from you, and so it's very important to cherish every moment that you have with them and to tell them that you love them as often as you possibly can. 
 Yeah. That's such a great lesson to take from that. 
 It really is. 
 And thank you for sharing that with me. 
 Honestly, like, that means the world to me, that you could open up and tell me that. 
 (West) - I think she reacted about as well as she possibly could've. 
 She was supportive, sympathetic, and generally, she just seemed like a very caring person, and I really love that in a woman. 
 It can be difficult, but I am always gonna try my best for you. 
 I want you to know that. 
 Thank you, West. 
 That's really sweet. 
 Man : Let's talk about your date there, big guy. 
 Man : Yeah, come on. 
 (Speaks indistinctly) 
 We went ring shopping. 
 What? Are you serious? We checked out cakes, we checked out the wedding chapel. 
 Man : At the chapel, was there an actual ceremony? 
 Yeah, we had a ceremony. 
 Man : So you're married? 
 I didn't want to break the news to you guys this way. 
 You already got sent home. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's okay that my fiancée was out with 12 other guys today. 
 I'm comfortable with that. 
 Man : - Do you trust her? 
 I trust her at this point. 
 Man : - The nerve of this guy. 
 Man : - Hey. Hey, West. 
 You took her inside to the stage. 
 You got some one-on-one time, you jerk. 
 Better than being in the group, right? 
 It's nice to get away, and, like, not have to do that and really talk on a-a human- to-human level, you know? 
 (Bentley) West is really hoping to get the rose, but, uh, I am very competitive, and I will be pissed if I don't get the rose. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm gonna show you my suite. 
 She's obviously a beautiful girl, she has a great body, amazing butt, and rockin' legs, and having her tickle my... (Bleep) 
 I mean, that would be amazing. 
 The competition makes it exciting, I mean competing for her, and that's the extent in terms of my interest. 
 You know, I mean, she's just not my type. 
 Ah! 
 So... 
 So... 
 So, um, I don't think I've had a chance yet to thank you for giving me the very last rose. 
 (Laughs) 
 Like, the very, like... 
 Not the second to last, like not the middle of the pack, but the very last one. 
 Mm-hmm. Were you worried? 
 For sure I was, yeah. 
 By the end of the, like, the last few roses, why wouldn't I be? 
 It's really easy to play a game with yourself and say okay, well, you know, there are how many guys, and she had a great date with this guy, she had a great date with this guy," and it's really difficult to, like, pick up a read when, you know, you're sharing the day with 12 other guys or six other guys, like, you know what I'm saying? 
 You're being insecure right now. 
 No. 
 You're being me last time, you know that? 
 No, no, I-I'm... 
 If... if this is insecure, then I'm insecure, whatever. 
 I don't... I don't... 
 (Giggles) Whatever. 
 But I'm just saying, like... 
 If I didn't have a daughter... 
 It'd be different. 
 Do you think that's gonna be something that would take you out of this whole thing? 
 (Clicks tongue) - Um... 
 You know, if it became too hard? 
 I think if something did take me out, that would be it. 
 That would be it? 
 That would be it. 
 Hmm. 
 The only thing I wanna say to you is if you feel something for me, which you probably don't know now, but you might know eventually, like, please stay, because I feel something for you, so I'm just... 
 To what point? 
 Like, I mean... 
 Bentley, listen to me. 
 Just... you need to trust me. - Okay. Okay. 
 No, I do trust you. 
 I do trust you. 
 I know, Bentley, but you need to listen to me. 
 And... and I'm not sa... 
 I'm... I'm not... 
 No. Listen, I'm not a mean person, but you need to stop talking and listen to me right now. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 This is very important. 
 Okay. 
 If you feel something for me, please stick around. 
 Just please, please, please stick around. 
 Please. 
 Please, please. 
 It's almost like the game's over before we even push the start" button. 
 Like, let's not even play. 
 Oh, Bentley, Bentley, Bentley. 
 I had so many good conversations tonight, and you guys really opened up to me... a lot of you did, and I really appreciate that. 
 So when I give out this rose today, I just want to thank this person for being here even though I know they're giving up a lot to be here. 
 So, Bentley, this rose goes to you, and I know I gave you the last rose at the first rose ceremony, so I'm giving you the first rose. 
 I know. 
 Well, actually, no, it's the second technically, but... 
 So, Bentley, will you accept this rose? 
 For sure, for sure. 
 Got the rose, and, like, seriously, like, can we just bag this and go play Blackjack? 
 Is that okay? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Okay. 
 (West) - It stings not to get the rose, and so I started to feel like maybe Bentley is more competition than I originally gave him credit for. 
 I think Ashley is an amazing girl, so I'm really hoping that I get a rose at the rose ceremony. 
 What's the team name? 
 No Rhythm Nation. Cheers to... 
 No Rhythm Nation. 
 Ashley : Rhythm Nation now.

 All right, gentlemen time to flip the coin. 
 Man : - A coin flip for a one-on-one.

 I would love it if you would. 
 Okay.

 Ooh. What does that mean?

 I'm hoping that, uh, I'm on a hot streak and my luck continues through the date tonight. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 (Matt) 
 I've been pretty outspoken about Jeff and his dumb mask. 
 I mean, I get the theme. 
 At the same time, it's like, "Dude, enough with the mask." 
 The longer he goes without taking it off, the more at a disadvantage he is to everybody else. (Hawk cries) 
 I mean, his whole theory is, I mean, you're putting a mask on, so all you got is your personality, and if he's going for personality, I mean, his personality's not shining, in my book, you know? 
 Yeah. 
 He's gotta go. 
 Being in this house makes me feel, uh, uncomfortable at times. 
 I've always tried to accept the way people are for who they are, and not what they look like, but, you know, we're not here to become all best buddies. 
 It's not about them. 
 It's actually about a connection between Ashley and I.

 How you doing? 
 Good. How are you? 
 Better now. 
 Ooh. I like that. 
 Mickey looks absolutely amazing. 
 I didn't know that he could clean up any better than he did at the beginning of the date, but... (Inhales sharply) 
 Boy, was I wrong. (Laughs) 
 All right, you ready? 
 Yeah. 
 Let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 Tonight is really about getting to know Mickey, and I want to learn so much about him, about his family. 
 I want to see if there's a connection there. 
 Aw! 
 (Ashley laughs) 
 Wow! 
 Isn't it amazing? 
 Wow! 
 Crazy view, right? 
 Wow! 
 Can you believe that people vacation like this? (Laughs) 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 Ashley and I walk into the suite, and it's the most amazing view you could possibly imagine. 
 There's not anything you  can't  see. 
 I know. 
 And to share that moment with Ashley, I'm feeling pretty good right now. 
 (Mouth full) I had a really good time today. Did you? 
 (Mouth full) I did, too. 
 And it all started with a flip of a coin, you know? 
 That's true. Maybe it'll end with the flip of a coin, too. 
 But I mean, I wanna get to know you. 
 Like, I want to know everything that... there is to know about Mickey. Family. 
 Tell me about your family. 
 Okay. I have a fairly large family. 
 Really? 
 I have two stepsisters and one stepbrother. 
 So do you have any full brothers or sisters or just... 
 I don't. 
 A-a only child, yeah. 
 (Gasps) - Only child! 
 Yeah, only child. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I was, uh... 
 So you just have stepbrothers. 
 I guess I should explain that. 
 My parents are not divorced. 
 My... my mother's deceased. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How long ago did your mother pass away? 
 Just short of six years. 
 Really? 
 So it's been... it's been a few years. 
 But she was, uh, she was awesome. 
 I'm a huge mama's boy, and... and will always be. 
 I love mama's boys. 
 Um, I really learned a lot from it. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I mean, just... just the way I treat people... 
 The way I live my life, um, just in general. 
 Changed your life. 
 It's actually had a-a very positive effect on my life. 
 Ashley : I was heartbroken when Mickey told me that his mother had passed away, but I saw strength in his eyes. 
 He turned such a horrible, sad situation into something positive, and that's what I'm looking for in a husband... 
 Somebody that can take the good and learn from it and move forward. 
 She loved life, and she had a ton of fun. 
 Thanks for sharing that with me. 
 (J. P.) I can't believe I lost a date on a coin toss. 
 I'm incredibly frustrated. 
 It's... it's... 
 That's why I'm here, to spend time with her. 
 Yeah. 
 So I'm just trying to be positive about it. 
 You know, if she sends me home, well, I... 
 There's nothing I can do about that, you know. 
 The thing I can do is that the next time I see her, I just have to take advantage and... and make the most of my opportunity, because I don't want to go home. 
 Mickey... do you think he's coming home tonight? 
 Unfortunately, yeah, I do think he will be back with a rose.

 I'm so glad that you came here today, because I wanted to get to know you better. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You seem like such a nice guy, absolutely gorgeous. 
 I see a lot of things in you that I'm looking for, but after today, I just don't know how I'm feeling. 
 Okay. 
 Um... 
 I feel like we should flip a coin. 
 Flip a coin for that thing? 
 Yeah, mm-hmm. 
 What are you, crazy? 
 Yeah, let's flip a coin. 
 Heads... you get the rose. 
 Tails... you don't. 
 (Laughs) All right? 
 You're gonna... you're gonna let this come down to a coin? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I-I was a little concerned. 
 I was a little concerned. 
 Uh, you know, I mean, it's a... 
 That's a big risk to take. 
 And at that point, I thought, she is crazy. 
 Are you kidding me with this right now? 
 So you... you flip it, and I'll catch it. 
 Heads... rose. You got it? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (Singsongy) Booyah! 
 (Normal voice) Man, I'm on a roll. Can I have that coin? 
 Well, I was gonna give it to you anyway. 
 (Laughs) 
 I'm leaving with that Australian coin. 
 I was trying to scare you a little bit, but, Mickey, will you accept this rose? 
 I would be honored. 
 Okay. (Mickey) My luck has been running strong in Vegas. 
 I'm gonna retire the coin and put that away, and, uh, I look forward to spending more time with Ashley, and, uh, a key to my success today. 
 (Laughs) So I know it's really simple... 
 Oh, I love it. 
 But I wanted to walk on the beach, and... 
 I love it. 
 What do you think? You love that? 
 Uh, yeah, I never in a million years... 
 Does it feel good? 
 Thought that I would be walking on the beach... 
 In Vegas, right? 
 I've had such a magical night with Mickey here at the Mandalay Bay. 
 Mickey is having a great night, but I have a pretty incredible surprise for him tonight. 
 Many more of those... dinners. 
 Mm-hmm.

 (Thunder rumbles) 
 You definitely feel the change in, you know, mood, compared to the first rose ceremony. 
 Man : Yeah. I think the first time was, like, a little excitement, knowing what to expect. 
 Now it's a little real. 
 (Nick) You can feel a little bit more tension in the house today. 
 It's dark and dreary, and people are realizing, whoa, you know, this is... this is real. 
 You know, some guys are gonna get sent home tonight. 
 (Constantine) - It's definitely a big night. 
 (Matt) Yeah. Unless you got one of those red things on, You really don't know. 
 (Jeff) Even though William, Mickey, and Bentley all have roses, there's a lot of guys, including myself, that haven't spoken to her much, so I think tonight is gonna be difficult without a mask, let alone wearing a mask. 
 (J. P.) I've been pretty disappointed and deflated because I've spent virtually no time with her, I've lost a coin toss for a one-on-one. 
 So I need to make an impression on Ashley. 
 I'm gonna be the first guy to talk to her tonight, hands-down. 
 No one's getting in my way. 
 Man : - Wow! 
 Man : - Ooh! 
 (Singsongy) - Hey, guys. 
 Hey! 
 How are you? You look great. 
 Good. Hi. Nice to see you. 
 Ashley : Walking into the party tonight, I'm feeling a lot of pressure. 
 There are a lot of guys left, and I didn't really get much of a chance to sit down and talk to them, so tonight is gonna be a really busy night. I know everyone didn't get, um, a date this week. 
 Yeah. 
 So close. 
 But I just want you to know that I obviously didn't forget about you, and I'm so excited to get to know everyone. 
 So cheers to a great night, guys. 
 Cheers. 
 Man : - Cheers. 
 Man : Cheers. 
 Cheers. Cheers. 
 We gotta talk. 
 Oh, no! Am I in trouble? 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Not in trouble. 
 50/50. (Laughs) 
 That's pretty good odds. 
 Pretty good. 
 I know. Wanna chat? 
 Sure. I'd love to. 
 How's it going? 
 Man : - That was quick. 
 Man : - Well, we got to see her for a minute. 
 I know, right? That's so much waiting, and it's like, "Hey, smile and look amazing, and I'm out." 
 J.P. 
 I cannot believe you left the one-on-one date up to a coin toss. 
 (Laughs) - I couldn't decide, you know? No. 
 So I-I knew that obviously there were five of us left that hadn't spent any time with you at all, so... 
 Mm-hmm. Well, we're here now. 
 We are here now, and I got a crazy idea, though. 
 What? 
 I will show you. 
 Oh, gosh. 
 Is this payback? 
 No, we're gonna flip a coin right now. 
 Heads... I get a kiss... 
 (Laughs) Wait. 
 Let me see that. 
 No... no tricks. 
 Okay. All right. 
 Tails... I don't. You wanna catch and turn? 
 Well, they weren't in your favor last time. 
 I get good vibes this time. 
 Okay, good. I'll catch it. 
 Ready? 
 Okay. 
 You ready? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 (Gasps) 
 No kiss! 
 I'm gonna have to start... no, what? 
 No, I'm just joking. 
 I am not the type of girl to really be... the one to lean in for a kiss, but for some reason, I wanted to kiss J.P. Tonight. 
 I'm glad you flipped it. 
 I am really glad you flipped it. 
 (Laughs) 
 J.P., I-I do want to say something. Um... 
 I would have been really happy to see you, um, come to Vegas, but I do see something in you that's really great, and I think that we'll have some good times ahead, and I want you to, you know, enjoy this and be patient and just... 
 I will be. 
 Just trust in it, all right? 
 Sounds good to me. 
 I came into tonight deflated and discouraged about not getting that one-on-one and losing the coin toss to Mickey, but now, to have it kind of  excel  to this level... 
 I'm on cloud nine. 
 Man : J.P.'S not the only one without a date. 
 Ryan, Ben, you haven't got a date with her, right? 
 No, not even close. 
 (Clears throat) - Not even a 50/50 actually. 
 I think we're all just like... everyone just wants time with her right now, so we're all just like, "When's my time?" You know? 
 If you guys want to really get something and win it, you just gotta go for it. 
 You just gotta get out there and take it. I already won a rose, but I'm gonna win the next rose, too. 
 Have fun with your drinks. 
 William's kind of getting on my nerves tonight. 
 You know, you come back with a rose from your date, it doesn't mean you have to be a jackass. 
 No, but I'll tell you what, like I really want to talk to you. 
 She's forgotten about you by now. 
 I feel like... I... exactly. 
 I feel like he's covertly kinda talking trash, and that just... 
 That irritates me. 
 I'm not a fan of people who come off brazen like that. 
 Okay, here we go. 
 I need your left hand and your right hand here. 
 Okay. 
 You're gonna start with right, right, back, back. 
 Man : - He's got a little dance. 
 Man : - Yeah, a little pep in the step. 
 A little pep in the step, I mean It's intelligent because he's crossing the barrier, he's getting to touch her hands. 
 Spin. 
 Is that right? I don't know. 
 Yeah, you're perfect. 
 You're doing great. 
 You're doing great. 
 Keep going keep going, keep going, keep going. 
 Whoa! So cool! 
 Nick, I love it! 
 You just made my night. 
 Oh, good. 
 It won't be the last time we dance. 
 All right, sounds good. 
 I got plenty more to teach you. 
 Well, all right! Confidence is in the air. 
 What's up? What is that? 
 Can you believe this? 
 I... what? You have a rose. 
 I don't mean to step in... 
 Will does have a rose. 
 -Yeah, what's  he  doing? 
 (Ben F.) He's stealing valuable seconds. 
 Nick, I had so much fun line dancing. 
 All right. Me, too. Thank you so much. 
 You guys line danced? 
 (Nick and Ashley) - We line danced. 
 Line danced. Wow. How are you? 
 Good. How are you? 
 I have some choice words for you. 
 Will already had a rose, you know, so I didn't think he has any place in taking her away from me when he's safe. 
 Man : What happened? How'd it go? 
 Um, we talked about how I like to line dance, and so I showed her a dance. 
 She enjoyed it. 
 And then ding-dong came in with a rose already and stole me. 
 (Man laughs) 
 Who... which... ding-dong being... 
 Ding-dong would be William. 
 Man : - Wow. 
 That's... that's fitting. I like it. 
 Man : - A new nickname. ♪ ding-dong ♪ 
 He's definitely gonna... 
 He's definitely gonna keep that. 
 Best date ever. I-I tried... 
 I know. 
 I tried to tell the guys about it. 
 I didn't tell 'em everything. 
 (Gasps) - Oh, no! 
 I mean, they're like, "How could it possibly have been the best date ever?" 
 And I told them -it was  the  most romantic date I've ever been on. - Really? 
 And for the rest of my life, nothing will be more romantic than the date that we had. 
 (Gasps) 
 Honestly, it was the same thing for me. 
 I... 
 It was a perfect, perfect date. 
 Come here. 
 I will see you a little bit later tonight. 
 I definitely think I'm at a disadvantage that I did not see her this week because she's obviously gotten to know some of the other guys quite well, so tonight is important. 
 I need to talk to Ashley a little bit more and get her to see who I really am. 
 Because tonight is gonna be the night that I finally reveal myself to Ashley. 
 (Thunder rumbles) 
 If you'd like to date the next bachelor or bachelorette, go to bachelor.abc.com and click apply." 
 (Thunder rumbles) 
 It's getting kinda late. 
 Who... who hasn't talked to her yet? Raise your hand. 
 Man : - Tonight? 
 Man : - Tonight. 
 (Blake) - I haven't. 
 Man : - Not one-on-one time. 
 (Blake) William's already in the doghouse for talking to her. 
 Oh, hey, speak... speak of the devil. 
 Men : Ding-dong! 
 Yo, turn around. Turn around. 
 There's a big target on your back. 
 (Laughter) 
 Things are kinda getting competitive now. 
 You've got William, who has a rose going in tonight, and nevertheless taking a little bit of time with Ashley, which is kinda difficult for the rest of us who haven't really had a chance to talk to Ashley on a one-on-one or anything-on-one. 
 Man : - Who is she talking to right now? 
 Where's... r... 
 I don't see Mickey anywhere. 
 The mask is not here either, though. 
 What if it's Jeff? What if it's the mask? 
 He said if he got some decent one-on-one time, he was gonna reveal himself. 
 Man : - Really? 
 What do you think he looks like? 
 (Matt) - I don't know. 
 He's just been wearing that mask around. 
 It's been kinda... kinda creeping me out. 
 What if you ripped off the mask and went "Ha ha!"? 
 Man : Ripped off the mask. 
 Joke's on you. 
 He's exposed! 
 (Men laugh) 
 Wouldn't it be funny if she asked him to put it back on? 
 Put the mask back. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh... 
 Man : Just put it back on. 
 Put... put it back. 
 You know, people are going to say a lot of negative things, but I don't care because this is serious, and this isn't a joke. 
 How you doing? 
 Good. How are you? 
 I've had things happen in my life that, uh, have allowed me to understand how precious life is. 
 And so tonight, when I talk to Ashley, I want to just have her get an understanding of who I am on the inside. 
 And then I am gonna take the mask off. 
 Obviously, wanted to talk to you a little bit about myself. 
 Okay. 
 And so besides all the fact of it's not all, you know, it's not about what's on the outside, you know, what's on the inside... 
 That's what counts... 
 Um, you know, I'm 35... and... 
 Okay. you know, at 29, my life kinda reset. 
 I had a brain hemorrhage. 
 Really? 
 I had all this stuff happen to me. 
 You know, uh, my ex had found me on the bathroom floor, and I was having seizures and then I woke up, essentially in the hospital. 
 And, uh, you know, my short-term memory was kind of messed up, and, um, and I was in the I.C.U. for, like, a week, and it was just kind of a long recovery. 
 I ended up, um, getting divorced. 
 Okay. 
 And, you know, here I am, five years later, and I mean, I've never been happier. 
 So, um, what w... 
 I mean, if you don't mind me asking, your... your divorce... was there a reason for the divorce or... 
 The person I was, uh, married to, I had been with for almost ten years. 
 Oh, really? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 So a really long relationship. 
 Yeah, it was long, and there was, uh, you know, just some untruthfulness that I found out about and decided to move on. 
 Okay. 
 And, I mean, I just don't take life for granted. 
 Good. 
 And so, you know, here I am, and it's kinda just, you know, I-I think I'm finally ready to take this thing off. 
 After Jeff told me about what happened, it was as if he just felt like he had to get it off his chest, and now he can be the real him. 
 So I'm excited for Jeff to take off his mask, and we can hopefully move forward and get to know each other more. 
 I'm nervous, but I'm excited to take this mask off and just see where it kind of goes from here. 
 I would love it if you would. 
 I hate to interrupt. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I was literally seconds away from taking this mask off, and, you know, of course Matt came in. 
 All right, have fun tonight. 
 We'll talk soon, okay? 
 Based on our conversation, it's really possible that I'm not gonna get a rose, because even though I had told her a little bit about my past, she hasn't seen my face yet. 
 Hey! Look who it is! 
 Man : - Oh! 
 Man : - Oh, he still got the mask. 
 (Ben F.) I think we were all a bit surprised when we saw Jeff with his mask on still. I don't know why, but your guess is as good as mine, really. 
 I just was waiting for the right moment, and I was literally like this, and I was, like, pulling it off, and Matt was there. 
 So if you don't get a rose tonight, how are you gonna feel, walking out of here, knowing that she never even got to see your face? 
 I know. That would be so weird. 
 If I don't get a rose tonight and the mask does, I will definitely feel cheated. 
 Ben! 
 Hello. How are you? 
 How are you? 
 Good. Very long time no see. 
 I know! 
 I haven't had a date yet with Ashley, so I really am feeling a little pressure right now, because I think we're approaching the witching hour in terms of me making sure I get time with her. 
 So I'm gonna be assertive. 
 I'm gonna be assertive, because I want a chance to talk to her. 
 I'm not gonna let it get away from me. 
 I'm excited to talk to you, 'cause I had to kill, like, a thousand spartans to get in here. (Laughs) 
 And it was unreal. 
 Like, you won't believe what I did to get in here. 
 You're like a table at an unbelievable restaurant. 
 I have to reserve weeks in advance. 
 It's ridiculous. 
 That's so funny. 
 It's ridiculous. I can't believe I got in here. 
 See, you're still cracking me up. 
 You know, you're sweet, but you say that to all the guys. 
 What? No, I don't! (Laughs) 
 But wait. I want to know about you, though. 
 Okay, ask me something substantive. 
 Ask me something serious. 
 I will tell you all the truths. 
 What do you want to tell me? 
 What do you think I would need to know in order to get to know you? 
 I don't know. Can I say that I was really jealous about the dance date? I like to dance. 
 Were you?  Really? 
 Yes. Oh, by the way, and I've never been to Vegas, too. 
 Oh! Well, you need to tell me these things. 
 I will. Next time you're gonna do some big date where people dance in front of thousands of people... - mm-hmm. 
 Write... put my name in the box. 
 But I do like to dance... - Okay. 
 And I like that about you. 
 I wasn't kidding. 
 My line at the limo... I kept thinking, God, but she's gonna think this is just such a line when I tell her that I'm excited that it's her, and it wasn't a line. 
 It was true, and I still think that we have a lot in common. 
 We do. 
 I just think we need a chance to explore. 
 I'll be honest with you guys. 
 I know I shouldn't say it. Mm. 
 You know the fountains at the Bellagio? 
 Yeah. 
 We had dinner out in the middle of the water. 
 That's insane. 
 It was already out there, set up. 
 We got in a rowboat and rowed out in the water. 
 Nobody's ever done that before. 
 Wow! 
 I mean, she gave me the rose, and then the fountain just went off. 
 Then, there? 
 And is that when you kissed, her, right after that? 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, that just sounds terrible. Like, I wouldn't... 
 I would literally rather be, like, swimming in pee than trying to plan a wedding with her, because I'm not thinking like, "Oh, my gosh. This is, like, the girl of my dreams." 
 I've been saying, like, she's just not my type, but it comes down to the fact that I get competitive about anything and everything. 
 And when the kissing starts happening, it's... it's definitely gonna, I think, increase my odds, you know what I'm saying? 
 You kissed her? 
 Huh? 
 You kiss her? 
 No, I didn't, but when I do, it's... 
 You know, the sky's the limit, you know what I'm saying? 
 Of course. 
 Actions speak louder than words, and I'm a fan of that, so do I need to force this kiss? 
 Do I need to, like, ram my tongue down her throat? 
 Honestly, I think Ashley will be open to it. 
 She's interested. She likes me. 
 So, you know, I kinda wanted to, um... 
 Get down to it pretty fast. 
 You know what? 
 Come here. 
 What are you doing? 
 (Laughs) 
 Come here. 
 You're not going to lift me. Oh, my God. 
 I think in my head, I'm a storybook romance kind of girl, and I'm very hopeful for one of those types of romances. 
 Okay. And so there was something about the way he brought me down to the fireplace, him holding me in his arms and walking me down. 
 I was speechless. 
 Are you getting tired of talking? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well, then let's not talk. 
 Ohh, what does that mean? 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 Mmm. 
 (Bentley) Wow. That was... 
 Kind of bo... it started out good, but it s... it sucked towards the end. 
 But it's more of, like, an expected feeling, you know? 
 I'd be lying to everyone if I'm like, yeah, I'm in this, like, to the end, you know, like, I'm gonna ride this out for two months. 
 There's no way I'm gonna last that long. 
 Do you think you're prince charming, walking me down like that? 
 No. 
 No? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 I think you think you are. 
 Just somebody that's trying to get you off your feet. 
 Mm, too late. (Laughs) 
 Man : - Hello! 
 (Ashley chuckles) Not sweep you, just pick you up off your feet. 
 Ashley : There's definitely a little bit of concern when I think about Bentley. 
 The only reason for that is because of the text messages that I received that he's here for the wrong reasons. 
 But to be honest, I have a pretty good radar in terms of somebody that's not being sincere, and I'm seeing such sincerity in him that my gut tells me to trust him. 
 Good luck tonight. 
 Thank you. 
 I could be completely wrong, but in my heart, I really  feel  something really strong for him. 
 He could be the one for me. 
 (Matt) - What have you been up to? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just talking to you guys. 
 (Glass clinks) What's up? 
 How you guys doing? 
 I'm sorry to, uh, bust up the party, but, uh, Ash, it is time for another rose ceremony, so if you would... 
 I cannot tell you how amazing this feels to have so many great guys in one room. 
 So thanks for, uh, another good night getting to know you guys. 
 You ready? 
 I'm ready. 
 All right. 
 All right, bye, guys. 
 See you. The mood going in tonight's rose ceremony is a little tense, because there's obviously three guys going home tonight, and it's really difficult to say who it's gonna be.

 Gentlemen, good evening. 
 Men : - Good evening. 
 Welcome to another rose ceremony. 
 It's been a good week. 
 Your dates began with Ashley, so have your relationships. 
 I just talked to her. 
 She feels really good about how this is going, and I know it's early, but she says she already has strong feelings for several of you, and these nights... always tough. 
 William, Bentley, Mickey, three of you already have roses. 
 Nothing to worry about tonight. 
 As for the rest of you, 12 roses to hand out. 
 Three of you will be going home tonight. 
 I wish you all the best, and if you're ready, here's Ashley. 
 Thanks, Chris. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Hi. 
 As I'm standing on this side of the room, I remember what it feels like to be where you guys are at. 
 I know it's not easy, but please just stick with it and have faith in the process, because... (Sighs) 
 It's really crazy for me, but after this week of dates, I can say that I think my husband is standing in this room. 
 So on that note, I'm gonna get started.

 That is no fun. 
 (Chuckles) Blake, will you accept this rose? 
 Of course. 
 (Laughs and speaks indistinctly) 
 Gentlemen, I'm sorry. 
 If you did not receive a rose, take a moment. 
 Say your good-byes. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Ah. 
 Man : Matt. 
 Matt, tell Gail I said hi. 
 Yeah, it's all right. No, I appreciate it. 
 It was so nice to meet you. 
 You got some awesome guys there, so all right, take care. 
 I know. Thank you so much for coming. 
 See you. 
 (Matt) I'm bummed out. 
 I feel like I just wasted an entire trip for losing it to a guy that had a mask on. 
 Like, my mask's off, my book's open, you know, I'm putting myself out there. 
 It would have been good to feel a little bit more desired. 
 You know, I laid it on the line and didn't get the rose, and now I'm going home. 
 (Phone rings) 
 (Automated female voice) Please record your message. (Beep) 
 Hey, mom. It's, uh, it's 4:00 A.M. in L.A. 
 Your lovely son was just not given a rose, and Ashley's not in love with him. 
 So I'll not be getting married. 
 I'm coming home. 
 I'm gonna need you to pick me up at the airport and give me lots of love and cook me French toast. 
 So love ya, and I'll, uh, I'll see you in about five hours. Bye. 
 Nice meeting you. Bye. 
 Very nice meeting you, too. 
 Good luck with everything. 
 Bye. 
 Thank you. You, too. Bye-bye. 
 (Stephen) 
 I'm really disappointed. 
 I came in there, like, open, and I really wanted to meet someone that I can be a friend with first and then enjoy life and fall in love. 
 That's something, like, my mom and Dad told me to do, and I tried to take their advice, but she's just not for me, I guess. 
 Ryan. 
 Bye, Ash. 
 Bye. It was so nice to meet you. 
 Thank you so much. So good to meet you. 
 So good luck. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. Bye. 
 (Ryan M.) 
 Life is definitely not fair. 
 I came here for the... the chance of finding love, and I wish things would have turned out differently. 
 Ashley is somebody that I see myself being able to have a true connection with. 
 And so, in... in me, Ashley's missing out on a great guy that... that would, uh, bend over backwards to, you know, to take care of her and love her. 
 And now, all of a sudden, I'm going home. 
 Yeah, it sucks. 
 Thank you, guys, for being here and being a part of this. 
 I know I keep saying it today, but I just want you to know that I feel so strongly that this is working for me and that my husband's in this room, and I have an amazing week of dates planned for next week, so cheers to that. 
 Men : - Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 Men : Cheers. 
 Next week on "The Bachelorette"... 
 (Trolley bell clangs) 
 Ashley : I feel so happy. 
 I think I'm gonna leave here with what I hope to leave here with... a husband. 
 You're, like, a great guy. 
 I just want you to know that. 
 Man : It was an absolutely unbelievable night. (Cheering) 
 I thought I was signing up to be with Emily or Chantal, and then Ashley's here. 
 (Audience) Oh! 
 (Crying) They couldn't have said anything more hurtful. 
 (Sniffles) (Voice breaking) 
 Deciding to do this was hard because I thought everybody wanted it to be Emily. 
 (Bentley) I came in thinking that Ashley was not attractive at all. 
 I'm not feeling it. I'm not sure how exactly this is gonna go, but there's no turning back. 
 Hi. 
 I'm gonna make Ashley cry, and I hope my hair looks okay. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Crying) 
 Ashley : My heart is, like, totally broken. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 (Sobbing) 
 Now how can I do this? 
 (Bentley) I had the opportunity, and I played everyone. 
 That's something that's never been done before. 
 It's all coming up next week on... 
 "The Bachelorette". 
 Who was the last villain you took down? 
 (Organ playing) 
 The masked man, savior of the earth. 
 (Jeff) I feel that there's still some people that, you know, look at me differently, I guess. 
 I knew that I was gonna be segregating myself from pretty much everybody. 
 (Clink) 
 What you guys doing? 
 I sit here with, like, this relatively serious look of this mask, but that's only... 
 Maybe 20% of the equation. 
 (Whirring) 
 You know, I'm doing a lot of, you know, things around the house. 
 I'm just trying to help out, you know? 
 (Whirring continues) 
 (Turns off vacuum)
