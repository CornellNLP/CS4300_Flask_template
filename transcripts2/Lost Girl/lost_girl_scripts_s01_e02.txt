 Okay. Oh, hinges. 
 (Clears throat) 
 Yes. 
 Screwdriver. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Plunger. 
 Duct tape. 
 Oh, sweet! Tiki lights. 
 I thought we were just gonna concentrate on the essentials. 
 Hello? Essentials. 
 With a little work, our crack shack is gonna start feeling downright homey. 
 Yeah, well, it's already the closest thing I've had since I ran away at eighteen. 
 So where does a little fae s*x killer grow up anyway? 
 Small-town midwest... all car shows and church socials. 
 Ooh. That would turn me homicidal. 
 You ever go back? 
 It's kind of tough growing up thinking that you might have a shot at being prom queen and find out that you're part of some ageless secret race that feeds on humans. 
 I hate when that happens. 
 Whoa, whoa. What are you doing? 
 I'm getting hungry. 
 Okay, how about we, uh, how about we make a deal? 
 We don't kill where we shop, okay? 
 Trust me, buddy. You already got lucky. 
 (Exhales) 
 Come on. Show yourself, you coward. 
 (Hisses) 
 Oh, is that the best you've got? 
 (Hisses) 
 (Hisses) 
 Oh! Oh! 
 Nice try. 
 Oh. Whew. 
 (Hisses) 
 No, no, no. Not this time. 
 (Grunts) 
 (Creaking) 
 Gotcha. 
 Life is hard when you don't know who you are. 
 It's harder when you don't know what you are. 
 My love carries a death sentence. 
 I was lost for years, searching while hiding, only to find that I belong to a world hidden from humans. 
 I won't hide anymore. 
 I will live the life I choose. 
 ::LOST GIRL: Episode 02:: Kenzi: Oh! Easy! 
 God! Not everyone here is a nookie-powered Amazon. 
 Whose idea was it to get a 200-pound sideboard anyway? 
 Did somebody tell you we were gonna live like savages? 
 'Cause it wasn't me. 
 Just lift. 
 You know, filling this place with furniture is one thing. 
 Paying for it is another. 
 No problem. 
 Really? You hoping I have some kind of fae money power I wasn't aware of? 
 Didn't cost a thing. We sorta liberated it. 
 Oh, no. No, no, we are not thieves. 
 "Thieves" is such a harsh word. 
 Think of it more as redistribution. 
 Okay, let's get one thing straight. 
 We stay alive as long as we don't piss off the fae too much. 
 We are not doing anything that draws any extra attention to ourselves. 
 Are you good with that? 
 Define "good. " 
 (Crackling) 
 Ah! 
 Holy crap! sh1t! 
 Sorry about the couch. 
 Oh! 
 Okay, you have exactly two seconds to tell us who the hell you are and what you're doing in our house. 
 Wow. Look at you. You're everything the rumors in the fae community said you'd be. 
 Wrong answer. 
 (Crackling) 
 Oh, come on! 
 Oh, come on! Enough already. 
 You flaming little... Ugh! 
 (Pants) 
 Sorry about the fires. 
 (Gasps) 
 It's a reflex. 
 Hell on the furniture, but it's kept me alive for a long time. 
 Yeah? Well, all good things come to an end, buddy. 
 See? See? People always go right to the violence. 
 And they wonder why I stay elusive. 
 Well, why don't you tell us what you want? 
 And then you can elusive yourself right out of here. 
 Most people call me Will. I'm a Will-o'- the-wisp. 
 You sure that's not, uh, Chas of the chunky Or Bob of the butterball? 
 Hey, I wrestle with my weight. What can I say? 
 You were telling us why you're here. 
 Well, here's the deal, see? I'm a woodland fae... 
 Light, just so you know. 
 I live in the forest outside of town. 
 (Snickers) 
 What, skippin' and a-jumpin' all the day? 
 Hey, there's no shame in that. 
 And of course, there are humans who wander into my turf, crashing through the woods, cuttin' down trees, looking for my treasure. 
 Whoa! 
 Whoa. Did you just say "treasure"? 
 Hey, get with the program. That's what this is all about. 
 Diamonds, rubies, emeralds... 
 Sir, have a seat. 
 Have a seat. That smell isn't bothering me at all. 
 Okay. 
 So I spend my nights searching the woods for precious stones. 
 What, like they're just lying around? 
 If you know where to look. 
 Most of the humans that have heard about it... and are out searching... 
 I'm able to throw them off with a few well-placed fairy fires. 
 But there's this one human. 
 He's been hunting me down for years. 
 A couple of nights ago, he got past the best I could throw at him and found my stash. 
 I got home, and it was gone... All of it. 
 And you want me to help you get it back. 
 Well, why not? 
 You're smart, you're capable, and best of all, you're not part of the system. 
 Okay. So why would you trust me? 
 Because... 
 I have something you'll want. 
 I'm not a big fan of riddles. 
 First of all, I have to know something. 
 It's about your feet. 
 (Snickers) 
 Kinky. 
 Oh, please. Grow up, will ya? 
 When I heard about the girl didn't know where she came from, I thought it might be you, but I need to know for sure. 
 Do you have a birthmark on your left foot just above the heel? 
 How did you know that? 
 Oh, true story, this. 
 Happened 28 years ago. 
 I was in my woods minding my own business, and all of a sudden, there's this woman crashing through the brush. 
 And we're supposed to care about this why? 
 Because the bundle she was carrying was a baby, a little fae girl with a birthmark on her left foot just above the heel. 
 Bam! Got your interest now, right? 
 What else do you know? 
 Unh-unh. Not so fast. 
 That only happens after you help me out. 
 You do realize that it might be hard to find some random guy in the woods that stole your stuff? 
 He dropped this. 
 Maybe there's something in here that'll help you track him. 
 Oh. (Laughs) 
 Hey. 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Uh... What she means by that  is, uh, is she'll see what she can do for a price. 
 You know, we can talk flat rate or a return of the percentage or, something like that, you know? 
 Excuse us. 
 Look, this is not about money. 
 I need to know about my parents. 
 Do you really think this bozo can tell you anything? 
 It's a chance I'm willing to take. 
 (Crunching) 
 Saturday night, I'm out with Katia, right? 
 The girl I was telling you about. 
 Remind me. Human or fae? 
 This girl is all fae. Okay? 
 So after dinner, we're back at her place, having a drink, listening to some music, one thing kind of leads to another. 
 Amazing how that happens, huh? 
 Yeah, so we're kissing, right? 
 She's running her hands through my hair, unbuttoning my shirt, stroking my man chest. 
 Stop it. 
 Only suddenly, there are a few too many hands. 
 Yeah. I open my eyes... Two of her, man. 
 Yeah. 
 A gemini? 
 Yes, both of them drop-dead gorgeous, both of them wanting it bad. 
 Just the way you are qualified to deliver, my friend. 
 Dude... I have sung my way into a lot of women's pants over the years, but I promise you, this was the most profound night of my life, man. 
 They played ice cream sandwich, okay? 
 I was the ice cream. 
 Hey, man, that sounds profound. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why I tell you is this... 
 (Woman laughs) 
 I know. 
 She's got a twin sister, okay? 
 Also a splitter, also gorgeous. 
 So you, me, Katia, and Karen... Double date. 
 Technically, I think that's a quadruple date, but let me get back to you. 
 I think I got something to take care of. 
 And I thought I was in over my head. 
 How'd you get in here? 
 I... said that I was your girlfriend. 
 Nobody seemed to have a problem with it. 
 I bet. 
 Gentlemen, would you mind just giving us a moment, please? 
 Thanks. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 You said that I could find you here if I needed help. 
 I just didn't think it would be this soon. 
 Are you that disappointed to see me? 
 That depends. What do you need? 
 You look hungry. Should I be worried? 
 You mean am I gonna go on a murder spree? 
 No. I'm okay. 
 But... I do need help tracking down who this belongs to. 
 How the hell did you get this in here? 
 My client needs to find somebody who took something from him. 
 He promised me info on my real parents if I helped him out. 
 That means this client is fae. 
 Well, there's a reason you're a detective, huh? 
 Bo... 
 This is not a good idea. 
 You should stay out of the fae world. 
 Just live your life. 
 There's just, uh, one small problem. 
 I wind up killing everyone that I let close to me. 
 Look, you are the only one of them that I can talk to. 
 You have to help me out. 
 No, I don't. 
 Fine. 
 I'll get help elsewhere. 
 But I gotta warn you, this could get messy. 
 I mean, I get taken in by human cops, I have no problem telling them what I am or what any of you are. 
 The Morrigan was right. 
 You are dangerous. 
 Well, flattery will get you everywhere. 
 Buddy... 
 Can you run the registration on this for me? 
 There's something I gotta do. 
 Are you sure we want to get involved with this? 
 I'm not sure about anything. But just... just do it, okay? 
 And you come with me. 
 Where are we going? 
 You want to play in this world, you gotta learn the rules. 
 If getting a fae education is all about visiting a bar, then I should've been schooled already. 
 Well, this isn't quite your normal bar. 
 These are all our people. 
 Your people maybe. 
 It's a place where we don't have to hide who we really are. 
 Dyson. 
 I have someone you should meet. 
 Trick, this is Bo. 
 Bo, this is Trick. He's one of our elders and the keeper of this way station. 
 Nonlocals who pass through have to declare themselves here. 
 Oh, you people have more rules than my old high school. 
 The Dal is also a place where all fae can find sanctuary from persecution. 
 It's neutral ground for light and dark fae. 
 Well, the looks people are giving me are hardly neutral. 
 The politics of remaining undeclared are complicated. 
 Well, I'm not very political. 
 Well, that's not something you get to decide on your own. 
 Okay, look. I just need somebody to be straight with me. 
 I'm like a baby here. There's stuff I have to know. 
 Okay. Come with me. 
 Nice decor. 
 Early Tolkien? 
 Where do you think he got it from? 
 (Chuckles) 
 Okay. 
 Bo... 
 Uh, mother's and father's names. 
 Sam and Mary Dennis. 
 Um... 
 I mean your real parents. 
 You tell me. 
 Well, we know they're both fae. 
 How do you know? 
 Those born of only one fae don't have any fae abilities, and you most certainly do. 
 Well... 
 Guess you'll remain a mystery. 
 Sign in, then. 
 So how about you helping me out? 
 What do you know about us? 
 That there are two types of fae, dark and light, that neither likes the other very much, and, um... 
 That all have some kind of freaky going on. 
 I suppose freaky is in the eye of the beholder. 
 Um, and the issue between the light and dark fae is a little more than just not liking each other. 
 We've been on the edge of a war for more than a thousand years. 
 That's holding a grudge. 
 Huh. A war between our people would end the human race as well as ours. 
 Well, if you people are so powerful, how do you stay under the radar? 
 It's more comfortable for us to remain a myth. 
 But it's difficult to do that, especially when someone keeps asking too many questions. 
 Meaning me. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Look, for some reason, my real parents dumped me, and... I need to know why. 
 Maybe they did it to protect you. 
 Leaving your kid to grow up to think that they're a serial killer without knowing how or why? 
 That's a hell of a way to protect them. 
 Well, have you ever thought that maybe what they were shielding you from might have been much worse? 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 My office called while you were in the back. 
 The gun is registered to a guy named Michael Connell. 
 (tears paper) 
 He lives in the north end of the city in a trailer park. 
 So what are you gonna do? 
 Pay him a visit. 
 Try to see if he has my client's goods. 
 I hope you leave him in one piece. 
 Well, if not, I'll be sure he goes with a smile on his face. 
 I'm kidding. 
 Bo, be careful who you trust. 
 There's still a lot you don't know, and people will use that against you. 
 Thanks. 
 She's gonna get herself killed if she keeps going this way. 
 I have to find a way to manage her. 
 If she's who I think she is, managing her will be more than any of us are up to. 
 Well, if this guy's sitting on a fortune in jewels, I hope he's planning to upgrade his crib. 
 I'm sure he'll appreciate the advice. 
 (Knocks on door) 
 (Knob clicks) 
 (Rifle cocks) 
 Crap! 
 Oh! 
 (Grunts) 
 (Grunts) 
 (Panting) 
 (Pants) 
 Oh. 
 One hell of a doorbell. 
 Tell me again why taking this case is better than stealing. 
 (Door creaks) 
 "Fairy Folk and You," 
 "Mysterious Folklore Creatures," 
 "Encyclopedia of Legends. " 
 This is not light reading. This is research. 
 Will was right. Connell was hunting him. 
 Hmm. 
 "G. W. Thompson Company Limited. 
 We buy and sell jewels wholesale and retail. " 
 If I just came into possession of a pantload of gems, this is the guy I'd want to go visit. 
 Yeah, a guy we might want to visit, too. 
 (Cocks rifle) 
 Hello, girls. 
 Going somewhere? 
 Actually, we're kind of in a hurry. 
 Oh, you're kind of in a hurry. 
 (Laughs) 
 Oh, honey, you better have such a damn good excuse for what the hell you're doing here in my neighbor's place. 
 We're friends of Connell's. 
 Friends? 
 Yeah, we, uh, came to visit, and he must have forgot. 
 (Scoffs) 
 Imagine, pretty little thing like you robbing a man's house and home. 
 I'm sure we can work this out without getting the police involved. 
 Hey, hey, hey. No, no, you stay. 
 Hey, hey, hey. Just let me explain it to you. 
 It'll all make sense. 
 (Gasps) 
 I promise. 
 Bo. 
 Just a snack. 
 I've never had... 
 Bo, that's enough. 
 Bo, stop. You're killing her! 
 Bo, stop it! 
 (Growls) 
 (Grunts) 
 Bo, stop. It's me. 
 (Gagging) 
 (Panting) 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. Thanks for the cockblock. 
 Yeah, maybe next time I'll do it from a distance. 
 Is she okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks to you. 
 Oh, my God. You're totally healed. 
 Side benefit of a feed. 
 That's a hell of a health plan. 
 Yeah, trust me, you couldn't afford the premiums. 
 
 
 
 Hey, uh, what are we doin'? 
 Are you gonna tell Will his guy's on the run? 
 You tell him. I'm gonna drop you off at home. 
 Keep him there and make sure he doesn't burn the place down. 
 Where are you going? 
 Going jewelry shopping. 
 (Door bell chimes) 
 Can I help you? 
 I have an anniversary coming up, and my husband said the sky is the limit, so I was thinking why not make it jewelry? 
 Of course you did. 
 And if it was gonna be jewels, I thought of buying some raw stones and choosing the settings later. 
 Someone told me that you have a nice selection of unset stones right now. 
 I don't deal in unset stones. 
 If you don't see it in the cases, it's not available. 
 If you'll excuse me... 
 Aw, hell. 
 (Gags) 
 Look, I don't do undercover well, okay? 
 So let's talk straight about this. 
 You bought a load of uncut jewels from a guy named Michael Connell. 
 He took them from a guy that I know, and I need to find him. 
 I don't know any Connell. 
 Oh, this is not gonna go well. 
 Aah! 
 Which hand do I break first? 
 What? 
 Which hand? 
 You've only got two, and I don't have all night. 
 No! 
 Where is he? 
 Simple. You tell me, and I'm gone. 
 Lakeview Motel. 
 He met with me at the Lakeview Motel, room 205. 
 I could only afford some of them. 
 I said I'd be back later this week for more. 
 Ah. 
 Well, you probably won't be making that appointment. 
 Oh, by the way, that emerald pendant is to die for. 
 (Pants) 
 (Sighs) 
 (Fire sizzles) 
 (Stomps foot) 
 Dude, could you stop that?! 
 I told you, I can't help it. 
 (Vending machine clatters) 
 Maybe if you stopped watching me. 
 It's kinda hard. 
 For a sprite, you take up a lot of real estate. 
 Oh. 
 (Grunts) 
 I didn't mean anything by that. 
 I'm large. I know it. 
 What? 
 (Sighs) 
 I get lonely, I get depressed, I binge. 
 Aren't there people that could help you with that? 
 Like some kind of Fae Fat Watchers or something? 
 I don't exactly show up for meetings. 
 Yeah, I guess not. 
 (Cell phone ringtone plays) 
 Yo. 
 (Bo) It's me. I've got an address. 
 I think Connell's at the Lakeview Motel. 
 Meet me there. 
 Should I bring our farty little friend? 
 Let's just see if Connell's there first. 
 Okay, good. I didn't really wanna singe the car upholstery anyway. (Siren whoops) (Police radio chatter) That succubus is having herself some kinda party. Anybody asking any questions? I've laid some dulcet tones down on anyone who took an interest. Man, how many bodies are we gonna have to disappear for this chick? Maybe she didn't have a choice. Maybe she's outta control. What the hell is she doing here? I don't know, but what I do wanna know is why someone rigs a shotgun to their front door. Jehovah's witnesses. (Scoffs) I'm just saying. Look, if we get our hands on little miss killer kitty... maybe we'll find out both. All right. Get on it. He's still there. Sweet. Let's break in and get yakuza on this guy's fae-robbing ass. No, you stay here and watch the door. I'll try to do this on the Q.T. Bo, you're not gonna... you know? Don't worry. The woman from the trailer park will hold me over for a while. (Sighs) (Sighs) (Knocks on door) Maid service. (Michael) Come on in. (Keys jingle) (Lock clicks) I'll try to make this fast. Take your time. I'm not going anywhere. I'm waiting for someone. Oh, yeah? I'm surprised that someone's keeping such a handsome guy like you waiting. You know what? I'm thinking it might be you that I'm waiting for. Whoa. Whatever kind of date you're expecting... You've got it all wrong. (Cocks gun) The maid was here a half-hour ago. Knew he'd send somebody for me. Where is he? "He" who? The man from the woods. My father. Okay, this doesn't make any sense. Will can't be your father. Why? Because I'm not fae? Because I'm not special? No. I mean, yeah. You're normal. But you're not. You wouldn't have trusted someone who wasn't one of them. You're fae. I guess so. Took me years to learn about all this stuff. See, only my father was fae, so I didn't inherit anything. Never even got to know him. Okay, hold on. You... you gotta back this up a few steps here. I'm missing something. You like fairy-tale romances? Here's one my mother told me a thousand times when I was a kid. My mom worked at a research station in those woods. One night she's looking out the window, and she... sees some green lights. She tries to follow them. Before she knows it, she gets lost. Next thing she knows, there's some guy standing there. Don't tell me. Kind of an odd guy in serious need of a wardrobe makeover? He seemed nice. He brought her food and wine. He told her he could get her out of the woods. It was a romantic night... full moon and everything. I'm afraid I know where this is going. When she left the woods that night, she was pregnant with me. Look, if you have some kind of daddy issues, there are other ways that you can take it up with him. What, you think I haven't tried? My mom wasted years of her life just trying to find him to tell him, but all he did was distract her with those stupid fires. In the end, she made herself sick, just stumbling around in the dark. She died with everyone still thinking that she was crazy. And so you figure you're entitled to his treasure. I don't care about the treasure. I just want to see him. I just want him to know me. Well, robbing him is a hell of an introduction. Look, you know him, right? He hired you to get his stuff back? I have the jewels in a locker at Fortress Self Storage on 15th. You get him to meet me, you can have it all back. (Gasps) (Blade whooshes) Oh... crap balls! You sit tight, and I'll call you when I speak to him. Okay? Friend of yours? He followed you. (Gunshot) (Grunts) (Grunts) Get outta here. I can handle this. (Grunting) (Panting) Ohh! Bo, cleaning product, 10:00! (Grunts) Oh! It's like he's got eyes on the back of his head. (Grunts) (Groans) Minus the head! (Grunts) (Panting) This is a new level of freaky. You sure this job is worth it? I'm starting to wonder. Uh-huh. Hey. Bo, this isn't a place to bring a human. Where I go, she goes. (Trick) You're claiming her? Yes. The girl is with her. Understand, she's your responsibility from this point on. Try not to steal anything, okay? I'm checking in, like you asked. We've got a small problem. We? I've got a body in the trunk of my car. And in a bag in the backseat. The girl from the trailer park wasn't enough for you for one day? Okay, you noticed, huh? Yeah. Well, I know I didn't call you about that, but this is different, okay? I found the guy that stole my guy's jewels. And then there was another guy that was trying to take the other guy out... Okay, okay, you lost me at the second guy. Bo, you can't keep doing this, okay? I promise you, this is not how I plan my day. Just show it to me. First problem... No head. Uh, he started that way. Yeah, second problem... It's a Dullahan. Okay. Obvious question... What the hell is a Dullahan? Well, you could say that they're the mercenaries of the fae world. Over the millennia, they evolved the ability to remove their heads. Like the Headless Horseman. They use it to throw fear into their victims. As a victim, I can vouch it works. They're usually unstoppable, Bo. Well, I guess someone forgot to tell this guy. Or maybe he wasn't listening. You get it? No head. Okay. I need to talk to you. Look, you have been lucky so far, but you are living in a world you know nothing about. Well, I'm learning damn fast. Are you okay? I need to look up the light fae's doctor, Lauren. She said that she could help me to take the edge off my lethal libido. That's asking a lot. Not so much. There are other ways for you to deal with that problem. No offense, but I don't wanna owe your team, and I'm looking for a more long-term solution, so... can you get me her number? Don't tell anybody you got this from me. Look what I found in Mr. No-head's pockets. Looks like Will isn't the only one after the jewels. Either that or this was payment for taking out Connell. Looks like your friend Will's got some 'splaining to do. Yeah, well, let's make sure he does that before more bodies start piling up. Will! Huh? Oh, hey. Hi! I was just wondering where you guys were. Yeah, move. Oh, now that's handy. You just, like, pull a trigger and pfft, it's out? I really have to get one of those. No. Ooh. What you really have to start doing is telling us the truth. You sent a headless nightmare after Connell. What, you mean like a Dullahan? Oh, no way. I hate those things. They're creepy. Beautiful. Now we have the pot calling the kettle "creepy. " Yeah, but you got away, right? I mean, you're here. So what happened? You catch this Connell? I barely helped him escape in one piece. Um, maybe we had a miscommunication. You know, I spend a lot of time on my own, talk to myself a fair bit. Maybe I didn't make myself clear, but I did say to catch him, didn't I? Connell is your son. My what? Your son. Hmm. (Chuckles) That... that... that's enough. Uh, I mean, that c... couldn't be. Me... me... me a daddy? About thirty years ago, there was a woman lost in the woods. You gave her food and wine... And then, you know... bow chicka bow-wow... A woman? Oh. Um... Ella. No. Ellie! Yeah, that's right. Ohh. She was beautiful, even for a human. Uh, we, uh... Oh, sh1t. I'm a daddy. What does he do? D... does he look like me? Oh, he's gotta be tall, right? Oh, this is terrific. (Laughs) No, what am I talking about? This is horrible! He's human. He can't know about me. Uh, that cat's way out of the bag. That's the whole reason he took your jewels. He just wants to meet you. Oh. Oh. I want to meet him, too. I could bring him somethin'. What... what do you think? Teddy bear? Fire truck? Just come with us to see him. That's all he wants. I have a stop to make, and then I'll work it out with Connell. Just wait here until I call you? Mm-hmm. Hey. It's not every day you become a father, right? How long have you been standing there? Not long. Mm. I like watching a professional at work. Oh, well, it's just boring research. Yeah, well, some of that boring research might stop me from killing someone. You, um, you said that you might be able to do something about my hunger. Does that offer still stand? You don't understand the politics of this world. It could be dangerous for me to even talk to you. The last thing I want to do is get you in trouble, but I need this. Should I be worried right now? I have desires, not enough to kill someone. Who else has to say this kind of stuff, huh? If you don't do it for me, then do it for the next person that I feed on. There is something I developed for an incubus I treated. If I'm right, it should take the edge off your hunger, but it won't allow you to heal. Let's see if we can ramp you back to randy. Frisky even. (Chuckles) Take your jacket off. Now if you learn to control your abilities, you might actually like being fae. Maybe. You should think about joining the light fae. I wouldn't have to hide my helping you. Well, they'd have to loosen up a bit first, start playing by my rules. Seriously, thank you. Mm-hmm. Connell. Connell, you here? I didn't know if you'd come. You talk to my dad? Yeah. He wants to see you as much as you want to see him. I can't believe it. After all this time, I'm actually gonna see him. Do it. Call him. (Beep) Kenzi, he's here. Yeah, he's ready to meet. Okay, twenty minutes, at the Fortress Self Storage. (Beep) You still have the gems? (Sniffs) (Cocks gun) What is this? I'm sorry. I'm not gonna be happy with just a reunion. The world's gotta know what he did. My mother wasn't crazy. No, you don't wanna do this, Connell. The fae won't let you. They won't have a choice. If they kill me once I've outed them, this thing will go even bigger. This is everything I've ever wanted since I was a kid. Throw me your phone. G... You're fast, but you're not that fast. Come on. Connell! Connell, let me outta here. It's no use. You don't understand what it's like... Being abandoned by your father, not knowing who he is, knowing he doesn't give a damn about you. I do know. My fae parents abandoned me. They dumped me with foster parents, and I didn't even know that they existed, not until the fae started happening to me. At least you got something out of it. You're special. You're like them. Talk to him first. See what he says. We've played it his way for the last twenty years. Now we're gonna play it my way. Bo? Kenzi! Get out of here. It's a trap. Go. Hold it. Hold it! Oh. I know your tricks, old man. You're not going anywhere. I thought this was supposed to be a reunion. What, you think you can just walk back into my life like nothing's happened? The whole world's gonna know you're real. They're gonna know what you did to my mother. You can't do that. He's got the gun. He can pretty well do what he wants. Your mother didn't understand. One of us can't be with one of you forever. You didn't even give us a chance. All I wanted to do was see you. I just wanted to get to know you. What I did, I did for her own good. Before you knew it, she'd want to know her own kind, and she'd want to tell 'em who she was with. She'd tell 'em about me. I couldn't risk that. Didn't you even think about her? I did. But time moves differently for my kind. Things are gonna move pretty fast from here on. (Scoffs) You're stubborn. (Chuckles) You got a lot of your old man's traits. You did this. I didn't know you were my son. (Door rattles) (Bo) Kenzi, in here! Call it off! I can't. Once they take a job, they always follow through. (Blade whooshes) (Bullets ricochet) (Grunts) (Grunting) (Gasps) Uhh! Uhh! Hey, flattop! We can both keep a calm head on our shoulders here, okay? Bad analogy. I mean, nobody has to lose a head, okay? Aah! (Flesh tears) (Groans) (Pipe clatters) (Grunts) Oh. (Sword clatters) (Pants) Ahh. So what now? I owe you a story. Better make it fast, Willy. That woman I saw running with the baby that night? She was a fae midwife. She was scared. But why wasn't I with my real parents? Were they dead? I don't know. This midwife wasn't exactly what you call chatty. But what she did say was she was afraid. She said someone was trying to hurt you. Who? That's all she said. Hey. You know more now than you did before, right? I don't know what the story was with your parents, Bo, but maybe they do wanna see you. Find 'em. Give 'em a chance. God, I hate when he does that. They're gone. And great, he took the swag with him. (Grunts) Bo? Bo, you need a doctor? (Pants) No. Get me Dyson. (Dyson) Bo, have you thought this through? (Bo) No, but it's the only way I heal. Are you sure you have enough medical experience? I know what you need. Are you gonna keep doing this? Mmm. If you don't wanna help me, I'll find somebody else. (Moaning) Are you sure you can handle it? I won't kill you? I'll take my chances.
