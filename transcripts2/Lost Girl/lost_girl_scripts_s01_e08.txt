 (exhales deeply) 
 Do I even wanna know what kind of trouble you got up to tonight? 
 (scoffs) 
 Nothing exciting. 
 I was tracking some guy for a client. 
 I thought he was alone. He wasn't. 
 Violence ensued. 
 At least you're healing a lot faster. 
 Yeah. Thanks. 
 Been working on that with Lauren. 
 I bet. 
 (scoffs) Jesus, Dyson. Leave it already. 
 She's just leading you on. She's never gonna love you. 
 Who said anything about love? 
 And you don't know that. 
 Bo, I meant what I said. 
 This was the last time. 
 For your own good. 
 You gotta start handling your healing on your own. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 (lock clanks) 
 (door creaks) 
 He is being such a girl. 
 Why, because wolf boy's tired of you life-sucking him whenever the mood hits? 
 You're right. What an asshole. It is not like he's not getting anything out of it. 
 Trust me. Okay, first off, ew! 
 And second, obviously, you can't have Dyson and chase after Dr. Hot Pants anymore. 
 Time to pick a team, dude. 
 Teams are stupid. 
 Are you sure this is where we're supposed to meet this guy? 
 Yeah, but it'll be a short meeting. 
 Why? 
 'Cause that's him. 
 Ouch. 
 Yeah, we really need to start hanging out with a better class of people. 
 (bo) Life is hard when you don't know who you are. 
 It's harder when you don't know you are. My love carries a death sentence. I was lost for years, searching while hiding... only to find that I belonged to a world hidden from humans. I won't hide anymore. I will live the life I choose. (chandelier tinkling) What do you think? Well, if it's suicide, I think he seriously should have rethought his last outfit. (gasps) (machete unsheathes) Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Relax. I'm on your side. (scoffs) Can you call off your human, please? Sorry. Thought you were dead. What's with the noose? Ugh. Unrelated business disagreement. (chuckles) "Dead." As if a little lynching could kill me. I'm mildly insulted. I mildly apologize. Mm. So... What's this information I'm gonna be dying to have? (unzips bag) (laughs) "Oh...ho, ho, ho." (makes sucking sounds) What if I said I found your mother? Hmm? (gasps, gags) I'd say you better not be messing with me, Siegfried. (strained voice) here. (coughs) Is this her? For 20 blood bags? You wish. (scoffs) That's as far as I got on the trail. The rest is up to you. She's out of my reach. "Lou Ann Heidinger"? Come on. Short, fat, and fangy here is playing us. You know her? Yeah, she's all over the news. And not only is she on death row, but she's on the other side of the border, genius. Her execution is in, like, three days. That's very convenient. I said she had the answers. I didn't say you had a lot of time to get them. I, uh, I like your necklace. Thank you. So... Do you ever miss working on normal people? No offense to my own kind, but, uh, humans are a little pedestrian now. (chuckles) Once you go fae you never go back, huh? So I hear. Speaking of humans... Have you... (beeps) had any success sexually yet? (whirring) Still a little scared to try the whole meal deal. But there's, um, no rush, right? Oh, no. No, of course. (beeps) You should take your time. Because I was thinking that taking things slow on that front would be good... for everyone. Hmm. (beeps) If they were okay with that. Devil's advocate... a succubus needs a healthy s*x life in order to be stable. (beeps) And, of course, when wounded, you'll still need to have s*x in order to heal. Yeah. Well, I kinda got that covered... Or I did, anyway. (beeps) Oh. Really? With who? Dyson. I... trust him, and he's fae, So I don't have to worry about draining him to death. (beeps) Mm. Everybody wins. Well, that's good to know. (beeps) As your doctor, I would be more comfortable with you choosing someone slightly less well-traveled, But, um... it's your choice. (pen scribbles) Now Lauren's acting jealous, I swear. (buzzer sounds) (sighs) The three of you should just get a room already. Here. I owe about a million favors for the rush job on these. Nice work. (sets cell phone down) (kenzi inhales sharply) (singsongy) This is crazy. A lead is a lead. Let's just see where it goes. Special agent Krazner and associate. We're here to conduct a final profile. Hmm. No. I don't see you on the list. Sure, you do. It's right... here. Okay. Mm. Head on in, agent. And if you need anything... (buzzer sounds) um, just call me. I bet you've never paid for a single speeding ticket. (whispers) Bitch. (creaks) (gate creaks and closes) What do you want? Well, first off, for the record, we aren't really cops. She knows. She's fae. I'm looking for my mother. I was told that you might know who she is. I don't even know you are. She sent me to be raised by humans, if that triggers anything. You're the foundling. I've heard about you, even in here. Just rumors, though. Nothing that could help you. Are you sure you don't know anything? Believe it or not, I am the last person that would want to keep a mother from her child. Someone's wasting your time, and you're wasting mine. Siegfried sends his best. (creak) Never heard of him. Well, that was rude and anticlimactic. (gates creaks and closes) Something's wrong. I just don't think Siegfried would have lied to me like that. (scoffs) Why, did he find vampire Jesus? No, but he knows I'm gonna turn right back around and kick his ass a lot. (buzzer sounds) There's easier ways for him to score blood. There's something else going on here. (record crackling) ("habanera" from bizet's "carmen" playing) (humming) (beep) Ah. (laughs) ♪ (sniffs) Ooh. (sniffs) (gasps) Oh. I hear you've been sharing family business with outsiders. Bad vampire. No, I swear. Well, maybe a teensy bit, but a fella's gotta make a living, right? Oh, don't hurt me. (groans) (clicks tongue) No talking. Ah. Oh, balls. Am I interrupting a meal? (grunts) Please. Don't let me stop ya. Aah! (groaning) ♪ Aah! Nah. Oh. (grunts) How clumsy. Uh, you would be a dove and, uh, pick that up for me, would ya? (groaning) (loud thump, record needle scratches) ♪ (continues groaning) No. Ohh! ♪ (garbage disposal whirring) (screaming) ♪ All right, I'm done. Tell forensics he's all theirs when they decide to bless us with their presence. Is he dead? What the hell are you doing at my crime scene? Just tell me... is Siegfried dead? So you admit knowing him. He was helping me with something. Something what? Something personal. Bo, please don't tell me this was another tip on your mother. Jeez. You don't get to judge me. You did not spend the last ten years a raging freak with a body count. I'm entitled to some damn answers. Fine. What was this incredible tip? That I needed to talk to Lou Ann Heidinger, that woman on death row. Did you know she's fae? She's dark fae. And whenever they're involved, Bo, you back off. I hope you're dropping this now. Well, I would if I got closure from Siegfried, but somebody made that impossible. (siren wailing in distance) Get me Heidinger's police file. If there's nothing helpful in there, I will drop it. Promise. Ask nice. Pretty please, with Siegfried's rushed autopsy report on top? You just used up your last favor, bo. I hope it's worth it. Siegfried didn't go easy. Someone made an amusement park out of his pain receptors. Yeah, there's nothing in Lou Ann's file that helps me either. There's no connection to Siegfried or me. (sighs) Okay, so forensics proved that Lou Ann drowned her stepkids and then set the house on fire to cover it. Mm-hmm. Siegfried wasn't drowned by any chance? Unh-unh. Heart cut out while he was still alive. What? Let me see that. There's no way a human got close enough for this. It's gotta be some type of fae. Why are there no defensive wounds? The report say anything about ligature marks, sedatives? Hang on. (presses key) Uh, nope. No restraints, no drugs. Mm, how is that even possible? You didn't do it. What are you talking about? You know what I am talking about. Someone was controlling you. Someone made you kill those kids. Lukas, Jacob, and Cody. They have names. And why does it matter now? They are going to execute you for something that you didn't do. I meant, to  you. Because I still think that we are connected somehow. And we just need more time to figure out how. Maybe we can help each other. How did things go so wrong for you? I fell in love with a human. I knew the rules, and I ignored them. It seems crazy now. It's not that crazy. Did he know what you really were? No. God, no. (voice breaking) And the more I loved him and the boys, the more I tried to cut myself off from my clan, to protect them. Guess I didn't do a very good job. Are you saying the boys were killed to punish you for choosing humans? I'd say they did a pretty good job, wouldn't you? Listen, I have a friend. She's connected with the light elders. I can get an audience with the Ash and plead for help. He won't let this stand. I'm gonna get you out of here. Thank you for arranging this. I know he's not a fan. Just... just... just... Try to be respectful, and... and brief. And... and don't mention that I'm helping you with your treatments. That's just between us. Should I also curtsy? Would you relax? (the ash) You've been rethinking your allegiance, perhaps. It has come to my attention that a fae is about to be executed under human law for a crime that she didn't commit. I know of whom you speak. It's a matter for the dark fae. But they're the ones that betrayed her. She is not of my clan nor under my protection. To interfere would be madness. Lesser things have started wars between us. So you would let her rot in jail for something that you all know she didn't do because you're scared to start trouble? It would be so easy for you to fix this. You have power in the human world that... Perhaps you should have thought of that before declining to join us. Child, you mean well, but you toy with elements you don't understand. So do you. Thanks for the advice. I'll let myself out. Oh, my. Still so charming. Go. What were you thinking in there? What was  I  thinking? God, you're the human. How can you work for that jackhole? He's as bad as the dark fae. Just for the fact that you're even saying that proves you have no idea what you're dealing with. Bo! This is dangerous. I have no influence with the dark. I can't help you if you get into trouble. I am not asking you to. You tell your boss he's not the only connection I have. (asian music playing) They call this moo shu? (pan sizzling) I  could make this. You're the one that eats here every damn day. Why shouldn't I? It took me 20 years to get this seat just the way I like it. Eat. I, uh... I have a friend in jail. I need some help getting her out. So you come to me? I'm flattered. Well, don't be. You're the only contact I have in the dark fae  and  human criminal worlds. Even I'm not so good with death row. You know? Sweetheart, you're not so good with subtlety. Some advice? Let this one go. God, doesn't anyone wanna help this woman? Sure. I want to climb everest, but it may not be so good for my health. Are you saying the fae will physically stop me? I'm saying that light fae, dark fae... all of us must must respect the one rule... Yeah, yeah, yeah, keeping our existence secret from humans. So? So what you're attempting is too high profile. All human eyes are on this woman, this Lou Ann. She chose humans over her own. My people objected. Who wouldn't feel slighted? So we made an example of her. Family business, end of story. So it's okay for you to kill one of your own? How is that all right with everybody? Because we expose nothing. The humans have someone in jail. The case is closed. Leave it alone already. That's how things work in our world. Well, that is exactly why I won't join your world... Light or dark. Not yet. Look, if you won't help me get her out, at least help me find out who put her in. Who did the real killing? I'll look into it for you. You'll hear from me. Bo? Be careful with this. You've already made some enemies. Then I'm asking the right questions. (gunfire) (rock music playing, game beeping) ♪ I have had a sh1t day. (keys clatter) ♪ If anyone wants me, I'll be in the world's longest, hottest bath. Mwah! And  I  will be saving the world from robot hookers. You're welcome. (gunfire, beeping) (creaks) ♪ (game beeping and whirring) (water running) ♪ (beeping) (roar) (gunfire) (gasps) (growling) (grunts) (coughs) (low growling) Aah! (thud) Bo? (bo gasps and screams) (whoosh) (growls) (hisses) Bo! (growls) Bo! Uhh! 
 
 Hey, fugly! Over here! (grunts) (growls) (groans) (grunts) (grunting) (growls) I'm not finished yet. (grunts) (electricity surging) (screams) Oh, sh1t. Aah! (electricity crackles) It smells like fried bitch. That wasn't an assassination. At least, not one sanctioned by the elders. (sets glass down) So she wasn't coming to kill me. She was just in my shower to what, loofah me? If that had been an official hit, they would have sent more than just one. Your powers are too unknown for them to risk anything but a major assault. But isn't there some kind of general fae rule about, I don't know, not knocking each other off? Keeping peace between the sides? But you don't  have  a side. That's what we've been trying to get you to understand, why we want you to choose between light and dark, like the rest of us. You have no protection if you have no fealty. So have to be owned to be free? No, just to stay breathing. Well, I don't accept that. (neverending white lights) ♪ Leave you all in pain ♪ Maybe you just never tried hard enough for something more. I've tried. ♪ if someone would have said ♪ 
♪ I invade you now ♪ 
♪ I take you down, I made you now ♪ You can stay with me tonight. You need more healing Than Lauren's little needles can give you. I needed your help tonight, not your pity. (sirens wailing in distance) You actually do dishes. I don't know. I guess I thought you'd just sort of... poof. I have an industrial dishwasher in the back. That "poof" enough for ya? You're a little too early for a drink. I'm probably too late for advice, but it's what I need. (glasses clink) What's a Morragh? Why? Because one just tried to kill me. (sighs) Come in back. Our little succubus is very persistent. I know you've been helping her without my permission. I-I-I... I assume you've been getting close to her for the good of the light fae, yes? Yes, of course I have. Good. And now we can use that relationship. The man Bo seeks is called Vex. He's a favorite of the dark fae. If Bo kills Vex, the dark will kill Bo, And I'm not ready for that until I know more about her. Good. How can I help? I'll negotiate with the Morrigan to have Vex sent away. You will keep Bo on a leash until he's gone. How? I've tried to reason with her. She's a succubus. If you want to keep her alive, I'm sure you can think of some way to distract her. (doors creak) (keys jangle) Nice. Like "antiques roadshow" in here. (chuckles) Hey, Lauren has one of these around her neck. What is it? Some kind of amulet? Lauren? She's ward of the Ash. She wears  his  mark. Because she works for him. Fae elders don't employ humans. They own them. In return for their protection. Oh. Cozy. She neglected to mention. Sorry to keep bugging you with all these questions. It's just, there's so many different types of fae. I wish there was some kind of book or something, To keep track. (loud thud) I also want a pony. (chuckles) "Kelties"... "Sprites"... "Djinn, Halforn"... I-I haven't heard half of these things growing up. We wouldn't have been doing our jobs if you'd had. There. The "Morragh." So tell me something. As a succubus, what do you feed on? Nicotine and wishful thinking? (sighs) Chi, I guess, or whatever you wanna call the human life force. Most of us feed on the humans in some way... their blood... energy... emotion. It's the nature of fae. The Morragh feeds on rage. You've angered someone, and they sent one of these after you. Well, what if they send more or worse? You're your own weapon. A succubus is not without power. No, that is not an option. I don't like losing control like that. At a certain point, it's not about losing control anymore. It's about taking it. Until you're there... (closes book) a Siracon. From the old times. It'll hurt all fae, And it protects the bearer from corruption. Well, whatever it is, I think it's happy to see me. What's it made of? Unicorn horn. (chuckles) sh1t. Really? (chuckles) I never know when to believe you. Probably better that way. I heard your friend Lou Ann dropped her appeal. I thought you might not want to be alone right now. Mm. Can I ask you something? (sighs) You barely know this woman. Why are you taking this so personally? Because we both want the same things. No matter how miserable I was before you told me that I was fae, at least I had hope back then that I could live a normal human life one day if I wanted to. But do you want a normal life? The picket fence and the kids and... I want to know that it's my choice to make, not theirs. I mean, Lou made her choice, and look at what they did to her. And I-if I just let that go, if I let them get away with it, then what chance do I have at living a life of my own? And who would want to live it with me? (sighs) Look, all I know is that whoever framed her... I'm gonna find them tonight. Wait. (sighs) (clara klein's "madmen" playing) ♪ You know ♪

I'm doing what I can politically. I just need a few more hours. (voice breaks) Is that why you're here with me? You're a diversion? Just hear me out. We have your best interests at heart, interests... We? Who's "we"? Bo. Were you sent here? Let me explain. Were you sent here?! Yeah. Look, it's not what you think. Just... You have no idea what I think And less about what I feel, or you could not have done this to me. (voice breaks) I'm... look, I'm sorry. Goddamn it, Bo! I'm trying to protect you. I haven't done anything wrong! You are in my bed because he  told  you to be. Everything about that is wrong. This is suicide. Vex is too strong for you. Oh, you know his name? Where is he? (clicks tongue) Where are you going? I'm going to get answers. I am through playing nice. (inhales sharply) Don't forget your dog collar. (necklace clatters) (sobs) (grunts) Aah! (clatter, thud) (silverware rattles) This is how you say hello? I know his name. Where do I find this Vex? Bo... You owe me. I'm calling the debt. On your blood honor. This is no favor that I'm doing you. Here. Here is where you go, if you're crazy enough. Vex is a favorite of the dark elders. You don't want that trouble. (clank) (clank) (whoosh) (crooked valentine's "War machine" playing  (gunfire) (woman) aah! ♪ (clank) (vex) Ladies and gentlemen! She's classy! She's sassy! Please welcome to the stage... Bo! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! You gonna show yourself? That's right. We haven't officially met yet, have we? And here I feel like old friends. I've heard a lot about you. You're a very silly, confused girl to care so much for the humans. (chuckles) You see, it's that kind of thinking that got Lou Ann killed. Actually, you're what got her killed, and I'm here to make that right. (whoosh) Ooh. I've got chills. How do you intend to do that, pray tell... (whoosh)  when you can't even control your own weapon? (laughing) (grunts) Ah. (grunting) ♪ (indistinct conversations) (sighs) What the balls, man? Are you cheating? Nope, just genetically superior. (kenzi) Oh, so you are cheating. I didn't know where else to go. It's Bo. I made a huge mistake. What did you do? She knows who framed Lou Ann. It's a mesmer named Vex. He's too strong for her, Dyson. Where? Uh, we... we think the strip club on prospect road. ♪ (grunting) (pants) (laughs) Ahh. Care for a drink? You know, I think you're the first person I'm gonna enjoy killing. (glass shatters) Well, that's awfully judgmental. You barely know me. (chuckles) You cut out Siegfried's heart, and you forced a woman to drown her own children. Well, I never said I was perfect, did I? (pants) (grunts) (grunts) (laughs) Uh-oh. Puppet cut her strings. Hoo-hoo! Fancy. I didn't know we were bringing toys, and that one's cheating, by the way. I can live with that. Careful. (zinging) I know things about you... and about your mother. Shut your mouth! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Why do you think I took my time with that chubby little vampire? Ooh, he was holding out on you, but I got all the goodies now. Then I suggest you share. Bo. No more games. You tell me who I am, or I will cut it out of you. (grunts) (grunts) You! Go. (grunts) To be continued then. I said, "go!" what are you doing?! (vex) whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Saving your ass. Let me go. Let me go! No! If you kill him, they won't stop until you're dead. I don't care. (zinging) I do. Bo. (zings) He was the only lead that I had left to her. He was lying to you, Bo. I wish I could tell you there was some grand conspiracy, but there isn't. Vex, Siegfried, Lou Ann... they didn't know anything about your mother. Nobody does. Somebody knows. Somebody knows! Let's go home. Let's go. (panting) (gasping) We need to talk.
