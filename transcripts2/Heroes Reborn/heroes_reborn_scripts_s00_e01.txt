 This is Hero Truther, I'm here to expose the lies and distortions. 
 To speak for the silent voices. 
 There's a war going on. 
 It's being waged right outside your door. 
 The casualties are neighbors, friends and family. 
 We stand on the front lines and do nothing to defend them. 
 I remember a hope we once shared: that our species was capable of something truly extraordinary. 
 You remember how that story began? 
 20 seconds that changed the world. 
 My name is Claire Bennett, and this is attempt number... 
 I guess I've kinda lost count. 
 She wasn't alone. 
 Hundreds were inspired to share their abilities. 
 Evolved humans. EVOs. 
 My name is Elluo Deahneahne. 
 And that's my attempt number 1. 
 Okay, keep the camera on me. 
 Hello, my name is Maria Campos. 
 They represented the people with human potential. 
 We were on the verge of something incredible. 
 And this is my first attempt. 
 What happened? 
 Oh my God, Donna? 
 What is it? 
 How can humanity, capable of such miracles and wonders, be full of such hatred? 
 It didn't take long for us to blame them. 
 We're getting report... 
 We fear-mongered and labelled. 
 There was no trial. No judge or jury. 
 The sentence was passed out just the same. 
 We let fear overcome common sense, passed legislation that violates privacy and dignity. 
 We're forcing them into hiding. 
 Into the shadows. 
 Where EVOs will become marginalized, dehumanized, jeopardized. 
 We know how the story ends, because it's played out, time and time again. 
 Mass murders and genocides, every time we say never again. Never! 
 Again! 
 Yet here we are. 
 Again. 
 
 
 
 It's time for all EVOs to stand up, and declare ourselves. 
 Come on Phoebe, you can do this. 
 Quentin, I need you to film something for me. 
 Can't really right now, I'm in the middle of beating some ass. 
 So... not right now. 
 I've waited too long, I need to show you now. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay... 
 So you want me to like, toss this across the room? 
 Please, don't, just... you need to get my shadow, okay? That's.. 
 Yes... 
 Yeah? 
 I have it, I have received the instructions. 
 Okay. 
 Um... remember when I was a kid, and I... 
 I always felt different, special? 
 Yeah, you wanted attention. 
 Yeah, um... 
 Well... 
 Phoebe... how are you do... 
 I'm Phoebe Frady, and that's attempt number one. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 You're an EVO. 
 You're one of them. 
 My sister is an EVO. How cool is that?! 
 That's amazing! 
 How long did you know you could do this? 
 Two or... maybe three years. 
 Two years? 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 I don't know. I.. I mean, I haven't told anyone. 
 What? That you're a shadow-mancer? 
 I just didn't know how to... explain it. I... wasn't lying to you or anything. 
 Yeah. 
 You know you can tell... me anything? 
 I know. 
 I know. I just... I... 
 Saying it out loud is a... makes it real. 
 Yeah. 
 Did Mom know? 
 No. 
 You're the only person I've ever told. 
 I wish Mom could see you do this. 
 You wanna see what else I can do?
