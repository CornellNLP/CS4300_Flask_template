How long have you-- we been in here? Time has no meaning here, only memories. Memories? They trick us into perceiving time as a straight line, with a past and a future, but really, time-- time is a circle. And memories are timeless. Every moment of our life, it exists in this place-- every memory. My memories were erased. Not in here. But you got to think deep, or you, our sister, everyone in the world is gonna die. And we'll be stuck in this loop forever. Focus on-- on a moment. Our childhood, where we came from... I--I don't know. I can't remember. You already have. [eerie music] Mom, what's wrong?

It's a pretty solid structure. [rumbling] [eerie whooshing] ♪ ♪ Phoebe? [grunting] Phoebe, no! Phoebe, no! Quentin? Quentin? No! No! Damn it! [whimpering] Quentin! Phoebe! ♪ ♪ [yelling] Phoebe! Let go of me! [grunting] Phoebe! [grunting] ♪ ♪ Let me go! Phoebe! Stop it! Phoebe, it's over. Why are you helping her? Erica's coming back. No, she's not. She was never taking us back with her. Okay? She used us. She used you to get what she wanted. No. No, that's not true. [rumbling] Erica made you into a monster. She made you into a monster, Phoebe. And I let it happen.

My name is Nathan. And you can't stop someone who can stop time. Time travel-- it's a bitch. [chuckles] The future we're standing in exists only because the H.E.L.E. happened. The moment you go back and stop it, all of this-- all of us-- will cease to exist. So which world are you going to choose? ♪ ♪ The one with your sister or the one with your girlfriend and your mother and the thousands of innocent people that you... brought here?
