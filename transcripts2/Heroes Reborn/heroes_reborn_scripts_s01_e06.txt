 Starting over is never pretty. 
 Previously on "Heroes Reborn"... 
 What is that? 
 A tracking device. 
 Jose! 
 The kind you build when you're planning to repopulate. 
 Dearing knows where they are. 
 I can't use my powers. 
 You will know what to do. 
 Why am I so important? 
 You're going to help save the world. 
 Aw, come on, buddy. 
 We built that. We did that. 
 We're talking total devastation. [gasps and coughs] Where's Hiro Nakamura? Why does Erica have his sword? Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me. She has him, doesn't she? [grunts] I'm only gonna ask you this one more time. Where's my nephew? Kiss my ass. [grunts] And I hope you're all right with never seeing this again. Where the hell did you get that? Followed you home from the precinct yesterday. I broke into your place while you were showering. You miserable sack of-- [grunts] Either you take me to your boss, or I leave you at the bottom of this pool. We'll see how fast he can duplicate another set of lungs. Dude, trust me. He's serious. If he kills me, you'll never find your sister or your boyfriend. There's a place. Yeah. Day's drive from here. About a year ago, they put out word to local PDs, 10 grand a head for anyone with powers. What kind of place? The kind where they keep Evos. They call it Sunstone Manor. Francis is being moved from Renautas Headquarters to one of our southern facilities in less than an hour. Phoebe is on her way back from Canada. And Erica? I can take you to her, but you'll never make it past security without me. Taylor, wait. No time. I gotta find Francis. With a power like his, I'm going to need your help restraining him. These are what we use for high-value retrievals. Half the size of the original Primatech model, twice the battery life. Good luck. [device beeps] [grunts] [groaning] Let's go get Hiro Nakamura. [dramatic exotic music] ♪ ♪ Refill for ya? You bet. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] The girl actually thinks she's saving her father? I knew Hachiro Otomo. He lived with his daughter, but this girl isn't her.  Clear the area. - All clear. But if she figures out that the sword is the key-- I have my team working around the clock to reprogram "Evernow." We've modded Otomo's original codes to create a new guard as an added precaution. But she won't be able to break out the prisoner if she can't find the prison. [sighs] Clear the area. Creating a cloaking system so she'll never find it. It's Joanne. Leave it short and sweet. [beep] Hi, honey, this is your loving husband. You know, the one you nearly shot in the face. I guess there really are things that can't be fixed through couples therapy. Anyhow, I was just calling to touch base, let you know that I sold the practice, and tell you that I burned down the house. Afternoon. Couldn't help but see you admiring the boats. Bob Berman. Berman Yacht Sales. Can I interest you in a boat? I'll take this. Only bigger. Okay. [reverse warning beeping] [indistinct chatter] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [indistinct PA announcement] Take it off him. Are you sure about that? If he leads us into a trap, I'm gonna blow his head off. No clones when that happens. All right, just pull it out? Um... [grunts] [device beeps] Ugh! Oh! Ugh. All right, let's go. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ They're fine. They're with me. [beep] Yah! [grunting] [both grunting] [grunts] Francis? Francis? [sobbing] Tommy. What happened? Did you talk to your mom? Is it true? Were you adopted? It's okay if you are. Doesn't mean you're not-- Normal? No. You're normal. Now you're making me sound boring. Oh, I'd take boring any day. We moved around so much, my mom lost all my baby pictures. I mean, seriously, if I could trade my power for a big zit on my forehead, I would do it in a heartbeat. Okay, trust me, no matter what you're going through, there is nothing worse than having zits and braces in middle school. [chuckles] Okay? Now, are you going to tell me what happened or not? [sighs] You want to get out of here? What about your mom? I just-- I need to get out of here, okay? Okay. Where to? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [screams] [yells in French] Are you okay? [man speaking French] [squeals] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [electricity zaps] Ah! This Sunstone Manor-- what do they do to people in there? Don't know, don't care. My 12-year-old nephew's in there. My life savings is God knows where, so quit your bitching and keep your eye on the prize. [engine revs] [tires squeal] What kind of lowlife sells out his own people for $10,000? One who likes money. A lot. Or do you just hate yourself so much that you gotta take it out on people like you? You wouldn't know the first thing about it, Hero-Man. [chuckles] Just be glad I didn't get the chance to take it out on you. Ain't like anybody else could have gone in after your nephew. What's that supposed to mean? Only way into Sunstone is through a checkpoint where they swab for powers. [laughs] Ah, the one guy who actually wants to break into Sunstone is the one guy who can't. Ah. There's always a way. If you're crazy enough, there is one way. But you ain't gonna like it. [engine revs] I seriously cannot believe I'm here. I know, I know. You probably think I'm a walking cliché, right? I mean, a girl who's always dreamed of seeing the Eiffel Tower. It's not that. You've got some Nutella on your cheek. [laughing] Oh, no. Oh, look. Wow. Bonjour. [beep] They're scanning for Evos. Come on, you can just-- No, no, we're going through. They already have me microchipped like a dog. What else do they want from me? Tommy, you can't. You went outside the country. It's going to be fine. [beeping] Non. Non. Interdit aux Evos. I'm not dangerous. You cannot go up. No Evos allowed. I just want to see the view. Why is that such a crime? Come on, it's okay. It's okay. Come on. No, it's not okay. Look, man. I could send you, your scanner, and this ridiculously ugly tower into outer space if I wanted to. But I'm not going to do that, okay? So please just let us through. Come on. [speaks French] [all speaking French] Emily. What were you thinking? That was stupid and risky and-- Gosh. I'm supposed to save the world. I know, it sounds crazy, but this guy who's been sending me texts-- my "protector" or whatever-- when I went to the hospital to see my mom, he was there. He told me that it was my destiny, like it's been some big plan or something. Look, all I know is, I'm not the hero they want me to be. I want to show you something, okay? Okay. [door closes] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Just a little further. [screams] [screams] Harris is g-- [all grunting] Since when do you speak Japanese? You mind running all that back in English? Because I'm feeling pretty lost over here. My father gave me the mission to find the Master of Time and Space. The Master of Time and Space is a friend of mine, Hiro Nakamura-- I came here to free him. That makes us allies. I'm Noah Bennet, and this is Quentin-- Hi, I'm Quentin Frady. Really nice to meet you. So you're like a cosplayer, or you do LARPing? We have to get going before Harris comes back with reinforcements. She's definitely not a LARPer. No. Now, let's get down to the basement. Oh, my God. 
 
 [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [gasps] [gasping] [panting] Huh? [indistinct chatter] 643A. Whatever Erica's doing, it's tied to Hiro Nakamura. If he's down here, he's gonna be guarded by something a whole lot worse than what we just faced. I won't let you down, buddy. Don't call me buddy. [gunshot] Go now! Warn the others! [overlapping shouting] Stop the machine. Ah! What the hell is this place? We use it to transport things. Where are you sending them? You're interfering with something you know nothing about. [gunshot] [screams] The future. To the future! Hiro Nakamura-- so you've harnessed his power the same way you did Molly's. Hold up. You guys built a time machine? Eh. Why? Erica's starting over, building a better world for a select few. Where is Hiro? Take me to him. I can't. He's not here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm telling the truth. He's not here. Not--not exactly. To trap Hiro and manipulate his ability, we had to imprison him somewhere without time or space. "Evernow." He's trapped in the video game. Well, get him out of it. Ah! I can't. I can't. No one can. [grunts] We can't, but Katana Girl can. [grunts] [gasps] [laughs] [both grunting] [chuckles] You think that little girl can get you out of this mess? Right now Miko is our only choice. She's not even real. The real Miko Otomo died in a car crash. That girl was created by her father, the game designer. She's an aberration-- a virus, programmed to a quest that will ultimately fail. You're lying. Miko will be victorious. It is her destiny. Well, then, I guess it's her destiny to die. The only way to free Hiro Nakamura is for her to sacrifice herself. [laughs] [laughs] [shouts] [speaking Japanese] What happened? To free the Master of Time and Space, I must overcome one final obstacle. What? What is it? Myself. [laughs] [elevator clanking] Uh-oh, we have company. [dramatic music] Phoebe? [breathing heavily] What are you doing? No, don't! [gunfire] Through the doors. They're bulletproof. [all shout] We learned about this in French class. They call the Seine the only river in the world that runs between two bookshelves. They've sold books here since the 16th century. It's the kind of stuff that starts revolutions. Okay, what's that got to do with me? Everything. Bonjour. Bonjour. These are what I wanted to show you. There was a time when the world couldn't get enough superheroes. But then a girl in New York City jumped off a Ferris wheel and regenerated in front of the whole world. And, all of a sudden, this stuff wasn't make-believe anymore. Who needs fiction when you got freaks like me? Those powers come with responsibilities. You have to be willing to answer the call. It's your destiny, Tommy. Kind of looks like you. Do you know what this is? Is it a rare one? I've been hunting this for years. It's issue number 31 of "9th Wonders!" There are rumors on message boards that the artist was an Evo, that the drawings in his books actually came true. See, Tommy? It's a sign. It's your fate. What if I'm not good enough? You will be. I know it. I think I'm ready to go back now. [alarm sounding] If you're planning to free Hiro, now would be a very good time. The sword's not working? It's my sister. Her power dampens abilities. As long as we're in her shadow, the sword's not going to put you back in the game. Well, we got to shut her down. I got this. Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no. No one's slicing and dicing my little sister, okay? Let me just go try and talk some sense into her. Yeah, you do that, and we'll try to keep them occupied. Come on. [groans] Hey. Hey, Phoebe, please, you don't have to do this. You can leave with me right now. Okay, come on. [shouts] [grunts] You need to go, now. You should get to a safe place. Do you know your way out? Yes. Go, now. [alarm sounding] What have you done? Phoebe, listen, okay? You're not thinking straight. Erica's been lying to you. Erica gave me a purpose, a mission, something to live for. Don't you understand what you've done? If that girl frees the time traveler, then we're all dead. [grunts] Phoebe! There has to be a reason, Quentin. Or not. Aah! Quentin? Quentin? Did I do it? Did I--did I save her? You did good, buddy. You did good. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [both grunting] [shouts] [shouts] You really think you're going to be part of Erica Kravid's brave new world? She's built her entire empire on the exploitation of Evos. She's gonna betray you in the end. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Good to see you, old friend. I know what you're going to ask me to do, Noah, but I cannot. Changing the past is very dangerous-- Erica Kravid imprisoned you. She used you. She slaughtered thousands on June 13th, the day my daughter died. She killed your friends, she killed my friend, and now she wants the world to burn, and she's gonna succeed. Unless you help me stop her. By imprisoning me, Erica Kravid bent time for her own benefit. That is a wrong that must be corrected. I will take you back, Noah, to June 13th, but promise me we will not step on any butterflies. Yes, yes. I promise. Just take me back. Okay. Welcome to Gateway. The residents are pioneers...  [toilet flushes]  Doctors, farmers, teachers, engineers who have dedicated their lives to creating a sustainable future for humankind. Renautas: where doing good is good business. Federal authorities shut down the National Mall today after several monuments were vandalized by the Evo-hacktivist group known as Hero Truther. The group also released a new video alleging that over 600 Evos have gone missing under mysterious circumstances since June 13th. In other news... Hero Truther, if you're out there, my name is Taylor Kravid. My mother is Erica Kravid, CEO of Renautas. She's not who she says she is, and her company doesn't do what it says it does. Those 600 missing Evos, she took them. All these missing Evos, here's where they've gone. Stop here. [engine shuts off] Gotta switch places with you if I'm gonna pass you off as a bounty. I've got a vested interest in your success. You got my money, remember? [sighs] Sunstone Manor. It's just on the other side of those trees. No guards, no fences. There's something strange about the place. No one ever wants to leave. One problem. I don't have any powers. Don't need 'em. You drink this, doesn't give you powers, but your swab will read a false positive. We go in, find your nephew and the priest, and we get the hell out of here. [sniffs] [clears throat] All right. [coughing] What's going on? Ah! What's happening to me? What did you-- [grunts] [screams] Oh, did I leave that part out? Thanks. Here. Eat. Well, if you're not gonna eat, you can at least tell me why you tried to kill yourself. I used to believe in something. I had a purpose, a reason for living. But then I lost it. I was just looking for a sign. I'm looking for something too. Someone, actually. 7 billion people in the world, and I'm supposed to find one of them. Crazy, huh? Where did you get this? You know him? [laughs] Really? I mean, I don't-- I don't know him exactly, but-- But you know where he is. He's in Carbondale, Illinois, last time I saw him. It's a sign, Luke. That's why we met, why I had to save you. I have to find him. Why? Because together, we're gonna save the world. [chuckles] [laughs] Then we better get going. [winces] Sorry. [grunts] Wow. Okay. You know, the whole ice cream thing doesn't work out, you should definitely think about becoming a surgeon. [both laugh softly] So what are you gonna do with it? I hear Antarctica's pretty nice this time of year. [laughter] Look, about today... thank you. What are you talking about? You're the one who took me to Paris. You know what I'm talking about. We haven't known each other long, but I feel like you've known me forever, and that feels... really good. Okay. [sighs] That felt pretty good too. My mother's Erica Kravid, CEO of Renautas. She's not who she says she is, and her company's not what it claims to be. Those 600 missing Evos, she took them. I've been to the top secret facility where Renautas has captured, experimented on, and murdered Evos. [beeping] Where have you been, Harris? We have a problem with my daughter. We've got an even bigger one. They've released Hiro Nakamura. [yells] [sighs] It's good to be back. So you have a plan? You know I do.
