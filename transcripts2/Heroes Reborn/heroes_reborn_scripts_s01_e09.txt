 Previously  on "Heroes Reborn"... 
 [groaning] 
 Where you been, man? 
 I've been looking for you. 
 You're alive. 
 It worked, didn't it? 
 That's awesome! What? 
 What's time travel like? 
 I hope this is good news. 
 You know that baby we've been looking for over the past year? 
 Turns out it's two teenage wonder twins. 
 Bennet's gonna take us right to them. 
 Hero Truther, my name is Taylor Kravid. 
 My mother is Erica Kravid, CEO of Renautas. 
 She's not who she says she is, and her company is not what it claims to be. 
 [grunts] 
 [both grunting] 
 [gunshot] 
 Why were you trying to kill me? 
 You can at least tell me why you tried to kill yourself. 
 I used to believe in something. 
 I had a purpose-- a reason for living, but then I lost it. 
 Sunstone Manor. 
 Gotta switch places with you if I'm gonna pass you off as a bounty. 
 You got my money, remember? 
 I don't have any powers. 
 You drink this, swab will read a false positive. 
 Suresh : Time was designed to move in one direction-- ever forward, allowing our lives to be a series of choices, threaded one after another. 
 [coughs] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 What the hell is this? 
 Did you double-cross me? 
 Calm down, and welcome back. 
 Try the cuffs. 
 Suresh : These choices define who we are, whether it is to protect the family we cherish... 
 The truth we know and the memories we hold on to, the past that we cannot leave behind, or the search for the answers to our own private mysteries. 
 But meddle with the laws of time, twist it, bend it, and even the smallest of butterflies can alter history itself, turn friend into foe, causing the most unexpected of consequences and the greatest tidal wave of change. I better go check on my mom. Is it safe for you to go back to the hospital? I don't know. But I'm ready for whatever's facing me. Well, no matter what, I believe in you. [chuckles] Before we go back to the real world, I got something for you. How did you know? Well, I just saw you looking at it at the souvenir shop by the Eiffel Tower, and I thought it's a good way to remember our trip. [horn honks] He's on his way. Yes. Just have to tie up some loose ends first. [phone beeps] [computer beeping] It's been hours since we lost contact with the Gateway Team. I'm worried that the engineer-- He knows the consequences of not meeting his deadlines. He'll be on schedule. And the status of our teleporter? We're--we're looking for alternates, but I-- Everything is under control, Richard. With less than a week, I'm concerned. Oh, don't be such a crybaby. Even if we had Hiro Nakamura, he'd be redundant. The boy has his power now, and he's being delivered to us. He guarantees our future. [sighs] My grandfather used to say, "The secret to a good kill is the element of surprise." This morning, a commercial jetliner made an emergency landing after its navigation system went awry. Experts say a geomagnetic anomaly may be to blame, as true north appears to be shifting... Your mom's one tough lady. I know. This is the second instance in the past week of an airliner going off course. [TV mutes] I'm fine. Now, about what happened when I left, I'm sorry-- You had every reason to be upset. Mom, it's fine-- No, let me get this out. I just wanted you to have a normal life. That's what a mom does-- protects her child. Mom, I can handle it. I know, and that's why you are ready for me to tell you about who you are. Okay. The comic book you love-- "9th Wonders"? You have more in common with your favorite character than you think. Hiro Nakamura? Yep, him. What do you mean, like, I have more powers in common with him? [sighs] You have exactly his powers. But Hiro Nakamura's a time traveler. I can't time travel. As a matter of fact, Nathan, you can. [dramatic exotic music] Right now I have to get you and your sister to Odessa. That's the most important thing. Then what? Look, I know this is very complicated. Complicated? Okay, Claire Bennet's my mom. I have a sister I've never even met before. Hiro Nakamura, the master of time and space, is my dad. And I'm only technically a year old. How is that complicated? Oh, right, I knew all this, but Caspar erased it. We're talking about global extinction. That's what we have to stop here. I know this is a lot to process. Why don't you take a few minutes, give Noah and I some time to talk? Okay? Yeah. You still haven't answered my question. Do I ever think about fate? Yeah. Well, we found each other, and you had a picture of some kid that I met, so yeah, I mean, it must mean something. It means that we were destined to meet, so you could help me find this boy. You sound very certain. I am. [girl giggling] You said you lost your purpose. But what do you mean? Like, lost how? I don't want to talk about it. You know what I hate? Tomatoes. They contaminate the entire sandwich. They spread their seeds everywhere, infecting everything. Besides, fruits do not belong in sandwiches. [chuckles] [rock music] ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] You sure this is going to work? As long as you stay away from the Director. Check your coms. Test, test, test. It's working. How about yours? All good. This Director, what's his deal? Word is he gets into your head. Hey, Bonnie. Pretty busy today. Yeah, new mandate from above. Bonus fees for time travelers and other high value powers. Just the one today, Mr. Dearing? He was wearing this crazy suit when I got him. You still catalog these? Was kinda hoping to keep it as a trophy. Now, Mr. Dearing, you know we got to catalog everything. Although it's been so busy around here lately, I'm sure no one would notice. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Open your mouth. ♪ ♪ [device trilling] [device beeps] He's good. Can I get my money? Once the paperwork's done, you'll be out of here. ♪ ♪ [tires screeching] [shouts] [both grunting] No! [tires screech] [chuckles] Wow. At the convent, Sister Pat had a pickup truck, but it never did anything like this. [laughs] You know, eating that crap is gonna rot your teeth. I'm making up for lost time. My grandmother never allowed candy, even on movie night. It sounds weird, but... it was the one time where I actually felt connected. Beyond the walls. Well, I don't think that sounds weird. My wife and I, we used to love taking our son, Dennis, to the movies. Popcorn, candy, the whole shebang, just to help him feel like a regular kid. And did he? Feel like a regular kid? He did. Yeah. He liked the funny stuff. Any time someone would fart-- [chuckles] He had such a great laugh. All right, give me one. [indistinct chatter] Don't worry. It's not a problem. They're shipping out all the essentials,  the Evos they need. So tell me, what happens in here? We evaluate you and determine whether you're critical to the organization. And if I'm not? The Director will explain everything when he arrives. This way. So what's your power? [gasps] You are so predictable, Taylor. Did you really think you could get away with this? That I wouldn't find you? Did you really think you could get away with mass murder? When that nurse put you in my arms at the hospital, I loved you. And I've tried to protect you from the world. Why can't you just trust that I know what's best? [chuckles] You're good, Mom. Almost got me. But here's the thing. You took Francis. You killed Evos to suit your own purpose. And this whole emotional manipulation thing isn't gonna work on me anymore. Who did you send the files to? I'd rather die than tell you anything. Who are you? What is this? [grunts] Sorry for the subterfuge. We had to be sure that we could trust you. Are you Hero Truther? I'm just one of the hunted. I need to find Francis Culp. Renautas is holding someone very important to us as well. The founder of our movement. The original Hero Truther. How do we get them back? We are hoping you can help with that. "A population can only be preserved if there are resources to maintain its survival." Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus. 200 years ago, he was right. Why didn't we listen? Did I ever tell you that I grew up on a farm? I don't believe you mentioned that, Miss Kravid. What we grew was what we ate. Farm to table. It was just our way of life. Did you find my daughter yet? She was last spotted in Los Angeles. A redhead-- very clever. Well, she's resourceful, I'll give her that. I have a couple of men on it. Will you just stop? You're decimating it. Taylor knows how to go off the grid. You have to outsmart her. We believe she's contacted Hero Truther. They've been trying to find Micah Sanders, their so-called leader. Do you think they have any idea what we're using Micah for? Just do whatever you have to do to stop them and bring me my daughter. Decided yet? Peppermint's always been my favorite. [chuckles] It's from Paris. It's from my boyfriend. He's so thoughtful. You should treasure those memories. They're what define us. Without them, you're a lost soul. First loves, they only happen once. [bells jingle] Oh, be right back. Shh. Care to join me? Whatever you think Tommy did-- Stop... talking. Miss, how much do I owe you? Don't do anything stupid. [clears throat] Miss? Get rid of him. That'll be $1.75. [change clatters] Tails. Bad luck. Why don't you take a seat? Calm down. Join him. Now! 
 
 Dearing, can you hear me? I took care of the guard, and I'm on my way downstairs. Where are you? Still waiting on the paperwork. [over PA] Good afternoon, this is your Director. Cliché as it may sound, this is the first day of the rest of your life, so think about how you can effectuate positive growth. Focus your breath. Find your safest, happiest place. Calm your mind, and let my voice guide you. [man screaming] Take a deep breath in and a deep breath out. [man screaming] Continue breathing. Take another deep breath in, and let it out. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Today, nobody is in charge of your happiness but you. Take a deep breath in... You weren't kidding about this place. - And a deep breath out. No bars on the windows. Why is no one leaving? There's another building around back. I'm gonna see if Jose's there. You know what the holdup is here? It never usually takes this long. New protocol requires a DNA signature. A what? Oh, they're just double checking. You know, making sure Evos aren't turning in Evos. We'll get you swabbed, and you'll be on your way. [chuckles] Yeah. [both grunt] Take him to the Director. That bad, huh? You're a hard dude to find, man. I guess. Ironic, huh? Meant to save the world, but you can't get yourself a chocolate bar. Thanks. [phone ringing] Excuse me. Sure. Hey. Your girlfriend and I are having ice cream. Do you want to join us? Damn it. I can see you're in pain. I know how it feels to be overcome with anguish and grief. All you want, even for a moment, is to feel some relief. A release. To be unburdened. I can give you that. It's what I do. You see that penny on the floor? Huh? Hey. All you have to do is pick-- Stop. [chuckles] It's about time. Let them go. They're innocent. Tommy, I'm handling this. [grunts] [gunshot] [Emily screams] [Caspar grunts] Stay... in the car. Please, I'll do whatever you want, but don't hurt her. I thought killing you would be enough. Or maybe you need to watch your little girlfriend die first. [crying] No, please! [door opens, bell jingles] [breathing heavily] I was hoping that you would have gone up in flames along with our house. But I should've known. Follow-through was never your strong suit. I see you've embraced your powers. Put down the gun, Jo. [Emily shrieks] None of this is gonna bring back Dennis. All the blood we spilled, Joanne, it was for nothing. Don't tell me you didn't feel better when you killed them. I didn't. Liar! I only did it for you. When Dennis was alive, did you know that you were one of them? None of that matters anymore, Jo. Just put down the gun. Tell you what, I'll shoot her, you kill me. Everyone wins. And I'll be with Dennis. No! [sighs] [Tommy breathing heavily] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [breathing heavily] ♪ ♪ [sirens wailing] [tires screech] Get in. Deirdre, show us the evidence you've gathered. Turn on the lights. What are these? Photos of the missing. His name is Micah. He was our leader. Micah has the power to manipulate anything digital, anything electronic. My mother has him, doesn't she? She's using him, and we need to stop her. What are the leads on his location? Stop! I know this place. It belonged to the people who owned the mine my grandfather worked at until he died. When my mother made her first million, that's the first property she bought. Director : Visualize the place where you're the most at peace. Your happy place. A beautiful place. What do you see? What do you hear? [chuckles] Who do you see? Is there some superhero signal we should use? How do you detect trouble? That's the thing. We sense it. Remember when Nick was bothering you at school? I spoke to the teacher, and the teasing stopped. I just didn't tell you. I knew you did that for me. And now we can fight crime together. I'm ready. As long as we're together. Jose, come on, we have to leave. El Vengador, the enemy's here! He's found our secret location! Dad! Come on, let's go! Come on. Stop! Let me go! Jose, it's me, Carlos. Come on! Come on. I want to stay! Father Mauricio, I have to get you out of here. I've seen the other side, my son. Come on, let's go! Why would we leave? We've all found what we want right here. What? [door opens] Jose, I'll be back. Dearing, help. [screams] Interesting. You are very interesting. You spend your life hiding who you are and hating your powers. You know, as the Director, I've seen all kinds of people, but a cop turned bounty hunter? That's--that's a first. Oh, hunting your own kind for personal gain, for money, that's-- that is a new low. At least I have a higher purpose. You are not worthy of being saved, my friend. We really are our own worst enemy, aren't we? Well, I leave it to you to determine your own punishment. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [gunshot] The Director will be with you in a moment. [sighs] [groaning] Well, you have caused some drama here today. [grunts] Get out of here, grab your people, and go? Is that really your plan? You can read my mind? And I know that, uh, you're not an Evo. You came here to save your friends, which is noble. Here's the thing. They're happy here. Well, except for your friend Dearing. Maybe not so much. [sighs] Remember that game where someone tells you not to think about something, and then that's all you can do? Think about it. He loved you. Had high hopes for you. Everybody's got one thing, Carlos. And I disappointed him. That's it, one thing that defines you. You saved us, Bennet. You saved me. Tell me, Carlos, what is it? Come on, Carlos. [indistinct voices] What is that? Come on. Come on, mijo, digame, ah? [yells] What's happening? Get out of my head! What are you doing to me? Carlos. You're hiding a shameful secret, Carlos. You're living a lie, ah? Interesting. All right. Let's see where this goes. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [distant gunfire] [gunfire intensifies] [gunfire] Ah! [men shouting] [screaming] [indistinct radio chatter] [gasping] [men shouting] Go, go, go! [shouts] [indistinct radio chatter] [men shouting] [shouts indistinctly] We need support! [breathing heavily] [men shouting] [speaking Urdu] [speaking Urdu] Gutierrez? Gutierrez! Gutierrez, they're knocking us out! Get in there and use your weapon. [sobbing] Farah Nazan. Huh, that's interesting. Might be more useful than I thought. [crying] [gasps] Where have you been? Tommy, where did you go? You can't just disappear like that. Caspar's dead. What? She shot him. Who? Who shot him? At Moe's. We have to go. It's not working. It's all right. Just stay calm. Try again. I-I can't. What's happening? It's not-- All right, all right. We gotta get out of here right now. Tommy, please, don't--don't go. Stay with my mom, okay? Okay, we gotta go. Get out of the building. Run! Not so fast. Quentin? I see you've met my sister, Phoebe. Drop your gun. The hell are you doing? What I've always been doing. Working with Renautas to save the world. You're the butterfly. I don't know what you're talking about. He's our only hope. I know exactly who he is. If you even think about pulling that trigger, I will kill him. I'll do it, Noah. I'll do it! Time to go. What's going on? What do I do? Stay calm, Tommy. It'll be all right. I'll find you. It'll be all right. [sirens wailing] [police radio chatter] [camera shutter clicking] Sir, police personnel only. Yeah, I'm the one who called. Noah Bennet. Malina? Sir. I'm her grandfather. You're safe now. I don't think we've met. I'm Erica. You must be hungry. I hope you like venison. I know your grandfather told you that you're meant to save the world. I'm gonna tell you how. Welcome. Cheers. [soft music] ♪ ♪ Suresh : No matter the unforeseeable consequences of our actions, when all seems lost and the future remains uncertain, we take solace in the knowledge that the sun will rise again... And what is destined will remain.
