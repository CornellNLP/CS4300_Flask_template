 It's time for all EVOs to stand up, and declare ourselves. 
 Primatech will open their doors on June 13th, for a three day summit. 
 EVOs everywhere must unite in solidarity. 
 It's important for us to be an Odessant. 
 Standing shoulder to shoulder, as one single species. 
 Together we can pave the way, towards a brighter future, for all mankind. 
 Phoebe hasn't called of text me back in days... 
 I know that she's a little pissed, but, ah... 
 I'm getting at little... worried. 
 Phoebe? 
 The voice message box is full and can not take new messages. Goodb... 
 Aly! 
 What? 
 Aly, where's Phoebe? 
 Been lookin' for her... haven't heard from her in days. You should have called me, She's not here. I haven't seen her. where's she been? 
 I sh... I didn't... I didn't know, I thought she was at home with you. 
 Look, last I saw her she was asking to like borrow a pair of flats for an interview. 
 For what? 
 I... um... maybe there's... 
 I saw a card... um... this is... this is it... this is the company. 
 Yeah, this... 
 Oh, I know this guy... 
 Oh, sh1t! sh1t, sh1t. I've got a call. 
 What? 
 Do you know this? 
 432-Texas? 
 I don't. 
 Quentin, I messed up. 
 I just want to come home. I'm not sure I can do this. 
 They... they want... 
 Come on, come on, come on... 
 Damn it! 
 Midland, just outside Odessa. 
 Primatech. 
 What? 
 Wikipedia Primatech conspiracies. 
 They've been tracking and capturing EVOs for decades. 
 It's a site of the summit. 
 I've got a bad feeling about this. 
 I'm going. 
 Wait, I'm coming with you. 
 
 
 
 This is it... this is it. 
 This is it, here take the camera. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna go in and talk to this guy. 
 Hey, ah... you wouldn't perchance have seen this woman? 
 Ah, this is my sister, she made a call at this payphone, like yesterday, 3.30. 
 Would you... are any of these, like, these security cameras, are they... 
 No I don't have access to these... 
 Holy sh1t! 
 Still if I had to describe it, I'd say... 
 She's at the summit. 
 We gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go. Come on! Let's go. Let's go! 
 You can see from our footage, traffic is backed up for miles... as people from across the globe pour into Odessa. 
 God! Come on. 
 People are walking... 
 Is this some kind of parking lot? Get back in your cars... 
 What the hell are you doing, man? 
 Get back...! 
 Argh! 
 Quentin, this is crazy. 
 We're not even moving. We're just standing still, we're never going to make it. 
 ... say what you will about the Chinese, at least they know how to handle the... 
 Oh, my God! situation. With EVOs under ... control. What did we do? Typical liberal response. we give them a soapbox to stand on. 
 It's Phoebe. 
 Quentin, where are you going? 
 I'm going. 
 Something's wrong. 
 Wait! Wait for me! 
 Delinquents with delusions of grandeur, who've been handed the genetic equivalent of a loaded weapon. 
 Oh, God! 
 Oh my God! What was that? 
 Oh my God! 
 sh1t! sh1t! sh1t! 
 Oh my... 
 Are you... are you crazy? Oh my God! 
 What is that? 
 Quentin, please stop the car! 
 Oh my God! Quentin, stop the car! 
 June 13th will certainly go down in history as one of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil. 
 With such widespread destruction and its sheer n... 
 We're expecting huge... 
 On this morning of hope, with dream of peace between Hey, hey, hey, hey! Excuse me! 
 EVOs and... 
 I'm sorry... ah, have... have you admitted someone named Phoebe Frady? 
 Just please... coming here... 
 Okay, you need to get... 
 F-R-A-D-Y. 
 I can not Quentin? Quentin! look up for you any information... 
 Please! I just need to know. 
 Quentin, come here! 
 Excuse me. 
 The FBI has confirmed that radical EVOs supremacist leader, Dr. Mohinder Suresh, has claimed responsibility as the mastermind behind today's horrific attacks. Officials Oh no! have also released the names and photos No, no, no, no, no! of ten persons of interest. 
 That's possible? 
 Suspect bombers, who took their own lives, carrying out the attack.
