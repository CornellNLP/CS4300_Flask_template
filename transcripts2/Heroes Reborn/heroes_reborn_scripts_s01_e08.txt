 Previously on  "Heroes Reborn"... 
 She had a visionary plan to save the world from a catastrophic even. Erica will choose who survives. I have a plan. Sad to say it does not include you. You got to admit-- it's nice to see him so happy. Whoa. I've never made this much darkness before. You better figure it out, because it has to cover the entire Summit. Where's Dennis? Dennis! Dennis! He could be out there, Luke. We cannot leave her. I know. My visions are fate. They're one and the same. These children will save the world. I'll go back with them, but I'm gonna need a ride. Hang on, baby. We're gonna party like it's 1999. Maybe there's a way to take Erica out of the equation. It is about fate. You do not mess with it. [yells] [sirens wailing] We at Renautas have gone to great lengths to build bridges. And like so many others, I turned a blind eye to the Evos who were radically opposed to these bridges. But now information is coming to light, indicating that this tragedy lies at the hands of the very ones it was meant to benefit. Hi. I checked with urgent care, and they sent me here. My sister, Phoebe Frady. Sir, we're not even taking names right now. I'm sorry. Please. Did you check the ER? Thank you. Out of the ashes of this tragedy, there will come a new and better world. We at Renautas are committed to that. Miss Kravid, sorry to interrupt. It sounds like FBI has a tape apparently made by a disgruntled Renautas employee, claiming responsibility-- Mohinder Kumar Suresh. Mohinder Suresh was a research scientist in our genetics division. Okay, but can you confirm whether Dr. Suresh was an Evo before we go to this FBI announcement? Dr. Suresh was an Evo and apparently also a very troubled individual. It is feared that he may have been responsible for the murder of his entire research team at a remote facility in the Arctic. Thank you. I have no further comment. [reporters shouting] I'm going back to Primatech for photo ops. You stay and look for any sign of Claire Bennet. Where's the car? Level one. Only moments ago, our station received a copy of a dramatic video apparently made by Mohinder Suresh just before he set deadly explosives at the Unity Summit. Despite humans being the dominant species on this planet, 12 brothers and sisters were able to change the compass today. Can you do me a favor? Can I get me some water? They bravely sacrificed their lives... to show the world that we will not conform to an inferior species. [breathing heavily] Okay. Okay. The time has come for us to claim our rightful position. Any attack, any blood spilled of a human is a victory for us. We will not stop until we have weeded you from this planet. This is your destiny. [yells] [screams] Oh. [screams] What the hell are you doing? What the hell are  you  doing? [groaning] [indistinct chatter over radio] Come on. What are you-- What am I doing here? I came back to fix things, all this. Help me, please. Where is my sister? My sister, Phoebe, Phoebe Frady-- where is she? This artery here, huh? You're bleeding out. I could call for help, but it's up to you. No, it's up to you. If you don't help me, you will never see your sister again. How am I supposed to know you'll let me see her, that you're not doing something terrible to her? You don't. But I'm the only chance you have. Ah! Damn it! You came back to kill Erica Kravid? No, that part was unplanned. You stepped on a butterfly. You stepped on the biggest butterfly. Do you have any idea-- Hiro Nakamura-- he brought you here, didn't he? Where is he? I don't know. He said he'd be right back. Well, he damn well better be, or we've got an even bigger problem. Well, at least you got the time travel right. It's 1999. But you were supposed to take us to my chateau in Geneva. We are still in Odessa. This is not possible. Well, just recalculate, and get us to Switzerland. It's not working. Well, try again. [grunts] [baby coos] It's the babies. Don't, don't, don't, don't come any closer. The boy is a Petrelli. I should've realized earlier. Think about it. The way Claire died in childbirth must be the same reason you can no longer use your ability. The boy is like his uncle and his great-grandfather. He can absorb powers. He took Claire's ability, and now-- He took mine. That's why I can't-- How do I get out of here? It's not about you. We have a bigger problem. You're a very bad baby. We have to keep him away from his sister. We can't risk him taking her ability as well. Now, the prophecy is set. These babies will be safe growing up in the past where they will never be found, but our plans need to change. They'll have to be raised separately. How? You take the boy. I'll see to the girl. And whatever happens, we must never run into our future or former selves. But I don't know anything about babies. You'll figure it out. Every parent does. "Parent"? Godspeed, Hiro! We have not been formally introduced, superbaby. My name's Hiro Nakamura, former master of time and space. [crying] [dramatic exotic music] [men shouting indistinctly and gunfire on television] So Taliban forces came up through the south and east entry points. The enemy had all escape routes blocked. Is that correct, Sergeant Gutierrez? Yes, sir. We retreated north of the building, where we were able to hold our ground. Due to a glitch in the footage, we can't make out what happened next. Lieutenant Nazan claims that you circled back through the east entry point and came up behind the rebels. Yes, sir. Two American soldiers died that day. Four survived. The question at hand is what part you played. Childbirth... Oh, my God. Claire was... How is that even possible? Her power just stopped working somehow. I have to see her. No. It's too dangerous. You're gonna have to trust me. You will see her again. I promise, when I--when you come back a year from now. You got to get back to the future now. You said Hiro was gonna be back any minute. He and Angela took the babies into the past to protect them from Erica. Erica? Erica, who you shot. Erica, who saw you, who saw us. I know, a momentary lapse. You changed things. Everything could be different when you get back. I need to find Hiro. It's odd. I'm picking up his ability-- teleportation, time travel. I'm not seeing him. He's in Odessa... or at least his power is. We need to get to him. And, you... you need to forget all about today, about Claire, and about the children. That's the only way to protect them. I'll find René. No, not René. Trust me. Use Caspar. All right, let's go. [sighs] No, not here. Back at the Summit, at the destruction. That way, after you're done, it'll seem like I hit my head, lost my memory. [coins clink, briefcase locks] [indistinct chatter] If your boy's one of them, it goes over there. Our son is normal. Baby, baby, baby, baby... My baby. I'm not telling you anything. Don't need you to. [door closes] [sighs] Hello, Noah. Matt... you're working for Erica Kravid? She's been really good to me, good to my family. [clears throat] I struggled for everything I ever got. I finally got smart, and I sold my ability to the highest bidder. Hey, I'm a company man now. Listen to me. Erica and Renautas don't want to help Evos. Oh, they're helping Evos. Maybe just a few, but that's good enough for me. Erica is our best hope. Get started, Parkman. Find out everything you can about his daughter. Right. You don't have to do this, Matt. I'm looking for my daughter, Claire Bennet. She's here. Claire's here, in Odessa. Or she was. She's-- She died at St. Jude Hospital here in Odessa. Her power just stopped working somehow. Bye, Claire. She's dead. Go to hell, Matt. Noah, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. How'd she die? Childbirth... Uh, childbirth. She died in childbirth. Where's the baby? The baby, Parkman, where is it? [grunting] His thoughts... Everything that's happened today--it's all gone. What do you mean? What just happened? I don't know. He's-- He's not remembering anything. Then he's useless to us. [breathing heavily] Ah, just take him. Get him out of here. Go. Go! Let's go, Noah. [door closes] [exhales sharply] The unevolved media accuses my people...  [knock at door]  of fostering an environment of fear, of terror, of hatred. But I ask, would any of our actions have been necessary if the world had not gazed upon us, if they had not made us feel terrible for their actions, if they had not treated us... You're leaving. Were you gonna tell me? My tour is up. I took a new assignment with a company I used to work for. It will take me off the grid for a long time. [sighs] What do you want, Carlos? I just got the call. They're giving me a medal... for what you did. We had a deal. I kept my end of it, and you're not getting court-martialed. You saved those men. You saved me. I just hid behind a wall. Suck it up. Don't you get it? The powers that be are turning the world against people like me. Maybe the truth could help. I would be in a military prison or worse if they knew what I was. And what about us? It'd all be a lot easier to swallow if-- if we faced this together. If you're uncomfortable with an honor you don't deserve... live up to it. You have to go. [sighs] [indistinct chatter] [woman speaking Japanese on television] [cell phone vibrates] Erica Kravid. Something is terribly wrong. The media is claiming that Hiro Nakamura  is one of the terrorists. I'm afraid it's true. Information has come to light implicating Mr. Nakamura. But that's impossible. Hiro Nakamura is in the game. Why are you saying that Evos are evil? Dr. Suresh was your employee. Thank you for your help, Mr. Otomo,  but your job is done. And I suggest you stop worrying about things that don't concern you. Tell me that Hiro Nakamura is still trapped inside that game. He is. Good. Then our plan is still in place. But he was also here at the Summit. Another Nakamura from the future. Or the past. Either way, it explains two Noah Bennets. Unfortunately for Mr. Nakamura, we don't need a spare. And I believe our friend Otomo's time with us has expired as well. I'll take care of them. I'm sure you will. And then you'll find Noah Bennet and encourage him... to tell you where that baby is. [intense music] ♪ ♪ [gasps] [yells] Take the next left. The FBI has now confirmed that Dr. Suresh did indeed have as many as 12 accomplices involved- That's impossible. I was with him this morning. He didn't do it. Of course not. Erica Kravid's made him her scapegoat. You did the right thing, trying to kill her. That woman deserves a bullet. Why would he be here instead of the hospital? 
 
 [dog barking in the distance] It's about time, my old friend. Reliving today was worse than I had anticipated. They said an Evo tried to assassinate Erica Kravid. Tell me it wasn't you. I'm sorry, Hiro. I had to stop her, or at least try. Noah, I don't regret the years I've committed to your plan, living without my powers. But you have no idea what changes you may have made to the future. I don't understand. If you lost your power, how was I able to track you? You tracked the boy. He's a Petrelli. Angela and I realized that he absorbed Claire's power. And that's why Claire couldn't heal. Yes. And then later, he absorbed mine, except he's only able to hold one power at a time. And since we separated him from his sister, Nathan absorbed no other power. [Door closes] Ah. I've been waiting for you. You were a baby in my arms... a few hours ago. And now look at you. Technically, I'm not even a day old. Same smile as Claire. Claire. Dad showed me pictures. I believe this is why I was freed from the prison in "Evernow" -- to raise your grandson. Thankfully, I had some help. You were in the hospital the day Claire died. I guess fate brought us together. And then you fell in love. I thought we had another year before it happened. If it's time... I'm ready. I'm ready to save the world. First, we have to keep you safe for another year. And I've got to figure out a way back to the future. But how? You lost your ride. Not necessarily. Don't move! Nathan... You okay? You all right? About those consequences... Yeah. My bad. They're onto us. We've got to warn Angela. Can you take me? To meet my great-grandmother? Yes. June 13th will certainly go down in history as one of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil, with casualty numbers expected to be in the thousands. [Knock at door] On this morning of hope, the dream for peace between humans and Evos was shattered in seconds by radical activists who sought to disrupt this historic summit. I'm sorry to bother you. I had to track you down. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't thank you in person. It was nothing, man. What's happening? Hey, I know you. Your husband saved my life. When everyone else ran, he came back, and he pulled me from the rubble. He's an honest-to-goodness hero. So, instead of saving Dennis... [Door closes] you saved one of them? Joanne, it wasn't like that, okay? I found him when I was looking for Dennis. He was buried. He needed help. I had to help him. No, you didn't. Our boy is more important than this freak. That's not fair. Shut up. I did everything that I could, babe. Then where is my little boy? I failed him, okay? Is that what you want to hear? I failed our son. I was the one who brought him here, and I wasn't there in his time of need. Is that what you want to hear from me? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have-- You people-- if it wasn't for you, none of this would've happened! Me? What did I do? You! You just-- Get off me! I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean-- You son of a bitch! No, no, please! [Choking] Please, please, I'm sorry about your son. [Yells] [Growls, breathing heavily] You had to do it. You had to do it. You had to do it. There was no other choice. Right? Jo, are you okay? Yeah... I'm fine. [Indistinct chatter] [Sighs] What happened? Who did this? Evos. Claire! Claire! Sir, come with me, and I'll help you. Come. Come with me. [Insects buzzing] Last night an old wolf wearing a crown of thorns crept into my dreams. Who else could that be but you, Noah? You must be Nathan. You're pretty young for a great-grandmother. Pretty big for a one-year-old. I would've visited, but I've been a bit busy with your sister. Malina. Sweet. Can I meet her? No, I'm sorry. You mustn't get too close. Not yet. You better have a damn good reason for bringing him here. Erica... [Sighs] Renautas found him. Impossible. We took every precaution. And I undid every one of them when I shot Erica Kravid. Lately I have been plagued with dreams... Fire raining down, blood everywhere, and the twins saving the world under a clock tower in Odessa, its hands stuck at 11:53. Odessa? It's the way the world ends, Noah-- under a burning Texas sky. How much longer do we have? When the magnetic poles shift, animal migration patterns will be disrupted. So you'll see birds, butterflies, all flying in the wrong direction. And eventually the northern lights will appear further south than ever before. That's already begun, a year from now. Erica Kravid has given up on humanity. She just wants to let the world burn. I know. But thankfully, your grandchildren... gave us another way. And now we're gonna save them... every last one of them. [Chuckles] He really is a Petrelli, isn't he? We better be going. So... you stay in touch with Hiro and Nathan, find them when the time is right, and I'll make sure Malina has made her way to her brother. Give us a smile. [Camera shutter clicks] [Knock at door] Come in. [Door opens] I owe you my life, Mr. Frady. We had a deal. Now, what did you do with my sister? I helped her realize her true potential. By kidnapping her, by torturing her. Nothing she did today was against her will. You know, the whole world might be buying this Suresh-is-an-Evo-terrorist crap, but I know the truth. You framed Suresh using a shape-shifter. Is that right? And then you used my sister's shadow to dampen everyone at the summit's powers. Then you blew them all up. And yet, you still saved me. You said you'd let me see my sister. Actually, I said that I was the only chance you had of seeing your sister. Unbelievable. Don't worry, Mr. Frady. I'm a woman of my word. [Muttering indistinctly] Farah Nazan... you shouldn't sneak up on an old woman. I sneak up on everybody. Meet mankind's greatest hope. Huh? Half of it, at least. When the time comes, she and her brother must be brought together in Odessa, but no sooner. Why not? Because, Farah... there's something I haven't had the heart to tell her. [Knock at door] [Knife tapping rapidly] [Knock at door] Hey, Q. Phoebe! Oh, my God, Phoebe! Hey. Oh, my God. My God. What did they do to you? Only good things. All my life, I've felt lost, out of place. Erica gave me a purpose. What? Killing thousands of people? You have it all wrong, Quentin. Erica's gonna save us. Please... come. You'll see that this is the only way. [Insects chirping, dog barking in the distance] Erica is onto you, well, the other you. It's a long story. I took care of him. Most of the day erased. Good. It has to remain that way. Claire's kids must remain hidden at all costs. I trust you'll watch over Nathan, keep his identity a secret. No one will remember otherwise. Molly, monitor Nathan and Malina remotely. Keep tabs on everybody. Erica is going to come after you because of your power. Trust me, I'd rather die than give them up. You think you could give me a head start? Sure. Where do you want to go? Chennai, India. Mohinder's mom needs to know the truth about him. Well, I guess it's my turn. Ready to send me back where I belong? Nathan, remember, when you're sending someone through time, you're pinching the fabric of the time-space continuum-- Dad, I've got it. Seriously. That's my boy. I'll see you in a year. And you too. Yatta. [Tires squealing] Nathan, you must take your mom and Caspar somewhere far away from here. What about you? Don't worry. I will always be with you. Don't do this. What are you doing? Saying good-bye. You can't. Living with you, the both of you, is more than I could have ever asked for. Thank you. Save our son, save the world. No, I'm not leaving without you! You must. This is your important destiny, my son, one I was sworn to protect. This is mine. Go. Now! [Door breaks open] [Running footsteps approaching] I've been waiting 15 years to finish this. [Yells] Dad, no... I have to go back. No, it's too dangerous. No, let me go! No. I can save him. Caspar, help me! I can't lose him too. Get off! I'll have to take everything. He'll only remember you. Do it! Mom, what's going on? How did we get here? Come on, let's go. Where are we going? I hear Denver's nice. Come on. Aah! [Groans] Just got to work on that landing. Bennet! Where you been, man? I've been looking for you. Like, one second, Katana girl's swinging her sword around, and then next second, both of you are gone. What happened? You're alive. Yeah, no thanks to you. Harris nearly took my head off and then-- it worked, didn't it? Holy crap! That's awesome! What? What's time travel like? Where's Hiro? I don't know. But you got your memories back, right? Hey, you were the one who said, "No more lies, no more omissions." I'm putting it all on the line here, man! Claire had two babies. What? I was protecting them from Erica. That's why I wiped my memory. Kids? Twins... boy and a girl. They're 16 years old now. I got to find them, and I got to get them to Odessa. Where's my gun? [Cell phone beeps] Hey, it's me. I hope this is good news. Oh, it's way better than good. You know that baby we've been looking for over the past year? Yeah, turns out it's two teenage wonder twins. Bennet's gonna take us right to them. Twins?
