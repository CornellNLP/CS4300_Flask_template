 Previously on  "Heroes Reborn"... 
 After June 13th... Claire! Your brother started an underground railroad for evolved humans. There's a unit inside the police department to compromise the railroad. Things go to whatever place you're thinking about when you touch them. What kind of demented place is this? [all grunting] I need my files so I can track down  an Evo named Molly Walker. She can locate anyone just by thinking about them. Renautas is using Molly Walker's powers to create a new technology. We got to get to Midian and save Molly. We have Molly Walker. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Get ready. There's another wave coming. Focus, child. [thunder rumbles] ♪ ♪ You just have to concentrate harder. I might-- I might not be ready. Malina, the storms will only get worse. The world will need your powers soon. ♪ ♪ Let's go! Come on. Why can't we fly? Or take a train? After what just happened, they'll be looking for us. Can't risk it. I know we gotta get going, man, but I think I need to go to a hospital. [engine turns over] I told you I'd sew you up when we stop for gas. Oh, what? With, like, dental floss? Come on, man. I've been shot. All right, all right, all right. ♪ ♪ [on radio] I've been thinking about this Evo rights issue, and the thing of it is, we just don't know what they are. They're called Evolved Humans... "All reports filed by Noah Bennet." You think this is his car? Holy crap. Do you remember that Evo couple we killed in Atlanta? No? Really? I choked her out. You shot him in the neck. We made it look like a murder-suicide. Yeah, yeah, I remember, back when we used to cover our tracks. The Shelbys. This is a hit list. Where do you want to go next? There is Oscar Gutierrez in Los Angeles, or I have Alexander French in St. Louis. [on radio] I mean, think about it. Can you really give an Evo the same legal rights as a human? There's nothing in the Bill of Rights that says we should. We need this. [on radio] Until we get more information, we cannot allow them... I need this. We made this decision together. I know. [on radio] You know, sometimes I wish that Bennet girl just jumped from that Ferris wheel and landed with a splat. Can we just listen to something else, please? [beep and electrical crackling] [engine stalling] What the hell? [engine grinding] Looks like we're walking. Unbelievable. You know how hot it's gonna get out here. Yeah. I'm burning up already. ♪ ♪ [all speaking Japanese] [alarm blaring] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] ♪ ♪ [shouts] ♪ ♪ [grunting, blows landing] ♪ ♪ [shouts] [shouts] [grunts] [dramatic exotic music] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Come on. Get out. Francis, you're not cleared for flight. What's the problem? You guys pissed someone off. Mr. Harris will update you later. No. Get him on the phone. Now. No, no, no, no. You can't do this. You can't send me back there. I can do anything I want. Can we all get on the plane now? You and the asset are cleared. You stay. Not a debate. Take your hands off me. [struggling] I'll sort this out. Don't worry. [screams] Just get her to Midian. They're gonna kill me! [screaming] Don't do this! Get off of me! You have no idea what's really going on, do you? Can you shut her up? [grunts] [tranquilizer gun fires] [ominous music] While governments become more and more polarized and too paralyzed to affect any real change, we must rely on ourselves to find solutions to the dire problems humanity faces. Let's be honest, if we had to rely on anyone else, how would anything get done? Tomorrow... we finally unveil EPIC. I expect it to be nothing short of revolutionary, not just for our companies, but for the entire world. Shintaro. We can make any modifications you need immediately, but without the processor back online-- I can assure you, we have retrieved the lost piece. The processor will be online ahead of the launch. There's no need to postpone. [door opens] Again, I want to thank all of you for your hard work. Everyone in this room helped Renautas become what is today by staying true to our mission statement: "Doing good is good business." Arigatou. ♪ ♪ There's been an altercation in the lobby. A girl with a samurai sword caused quite a scene. And not just any sword. Hiro Nakamura's sword. I don't understand. She claims to be Hachiro Otomo's daughter. How can that be? Security has her downstairs. Keep her in our custody until we know what we're dealing with. Then take care of her. ♪ ♪ [helicopter blades whirring] ♪ ♪ What are you doing? Hey there, mijo. Just locking up. Got a few errands I have to run. But it's Tuesday. On Tuesdays, I used to go over the books with my dad. He wasn't so good at math. I think we close up until we figure this out. What about all these cars? This is Gutierrez  and  Sons. That's you. That's me. I know, but things are a little more complicated right now. I have some things to take care of first, okay? They're not going to find who killed him, are they? I wouldn't be so sure of that. Jose, things are gonna get better. Promise. ♪ ♪ [indistinct radio chatter] ♪ ♪ [electronic chime] Domo arigatou. ♪ ♪ We land in Midian at 7:00 p.m. I'm assured we'll be online by then. We're holding Otomo's daughter in the main conference room. Do what's necessary to get answers from her. You didn't hire me for my restraint. ♪ ♪ [electronic chimes] [on TV] Scientists are baffled by recent anomalies in the Arctic Circle. Northern lights have been sen as far south as Fort Albany, Northern Ontari. You know, if Renautas is using Molly Walker's powers to make new technology, who's to say that the Evos you brought in for Primatech weren't used for the same exact thing? Like, I'm-- I don't mean to offend you, but that was your job. Mr. Frady. Remember, construction accident. The bullet went clean through, so say it was a nail gun. So don't tell them I got shot? Right. Don't tell them you got shot. Thanks for the guidance. ♪ ♪ Noah Bennet? Dr. Moore. Good to see you. I'm surprised to see you back here. Was just, uh, just passing through. Oh, is that so? Yeah. Uh, I'm sorry, remind me. When was the last time I saw you? A year ago. June 13th. It's a hard day to forget. You mind waiting here a second? I'll be right back. Yeah, sure, go ahead. I'll be right here. ♪ ♪ I need security here right now. [indistinct radio chatter] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Two hours, and all we got out of her is her name. Women are always the toughest. ♪ ♪ Either you tell me everything you know about the underground railroad... or I put a bullet in you. [grunts] Go to hell. [laughs] If this was official, I'd be in an interrogation room with my lawyer. If you guys are cops, then you're dirty, so either bring me in, or kill me. [grunts] ♪ ♪ Okay, okay, wait. Please don't. No, don't shoot me. No, wait, don't. [screams] ♪ ♪ What the hell? Now we're out 25 large. Don't worry. I tagged her. She'll lead us right to the others, and we'll make even more money. [metal clanks] Check it out. ♪ ♪ [gunshots] ♪ ♪ Down this way. ♪ ♪ Don't you ever do that to me again. This is not how you avenge your brother. That son of a bitch deserves to die. I'm just trying to help you, Carlos. Find another soul to save. ♪ ♪ [electronic beeping] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Uh, where the hell did he go? [on TV] Well, it looks like Renautas is on the verge of another major product line. Nice. [on TV] CEO Erica Kravid is rumored to make an announcement later this week. In anticipation of what insiders are calling "a revolutionary new product line"-- - [on radio] Suspect is wearing a blue suit, horn-rimmed glasses, last seen in the vicinity of the urgent care waiting room. Suspect is considered dangerous, possibly armed. All units, acknowledge description of suspect. Let's keep it nice and quiet there... Norris. I'm the guy they're talking about on your walkie. Why? You put a guard in the hospital last year. This hospital. I don't have any memory of that, so you're gonna show me on the security footage. I want to know what I did a year ago. Let's go. Stealing a big rig could be fun. Yeah, if you want to attract attention. Oh, come on. We can get you a trucker's cap, hit the open road, haul some cargo, play with the CB radio, or whatever it is that truckers do. Or not. Why are we still doing this, huh? Why don't we just go home, baby? [sighs deeply] Listen. I know that you got a lot of sun, and that you're hungry right now. But we're on the same side. BLT for the lady. Steak and eggs for the gentleman. Anything else? My husband might need a drink. No, we're fine. Thank you. Okay. I think we should go west to LA. Maybe see the ocean. You two always loved the water. ♪ ♪ [steak sizzling] ♪ ♪ You ordered rare, didn't you? Send it back. Hey, hey! This is not what he ordered. Pull up the footage from June 13, 2014. Scan through till you spot me. Stop. [beeping] It looks like you reappear there. ♪ ♪ Who am I talking to? Can you zoom in on that? Blow it up. Do something. It's the best I can do. Let me try another camera. ♪ ♪ Wait a second. The time stamp keeps skipping back and forth. Like a time jump. Hiro Nakamura. [keys clack, beeping] Wait, stop! Play that! Play that. ♪ ♪ No. No, no, no, no. That's not what happened. No, she didn't die in this hospital. That's not possible. Get a better angle. Those the only cameras in the room. Then pull up the records from the hospital! I need to know how my daughter died! [keys clack, beeping] ♪ ♪ Stop. [beeping] Molly? Hey, man. Hey, hey, it's me, man! It's me. It's me.

What the hell happened? I was there a year ago. What? On June 13th? Holy crap. I saw a body. It was Claire. She died in that hospital. How is that possible with her power? I don't know. I've been asking myself that question for the past year. I should have reached out to her. Why did I want to erase what happened? Why did I want to not know how she died? Wait a minute. The Haitian said I wasn't supposed to know the plan. Maybe that's what he was talking about. All right, all right. Did you see anything else? Yeah. Molly Walker was there. Molly Walker? And another thing. The footage kept skipping back and forth as if someone was manipulating time. I only know one person who can do that. Hiro Nakamura. Guess you don't remember talking to him either? No, I don't. There is one person who may have the answers. Molly. But if Renautas has digitized her power, they may be after the same answers. That can't happen. 
 
 [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Do you really know who I am? Or do the people you work for pay you enough not to ask questions? You got caught. I'm bringing you in. To Renautas. A tech conglomerate that for some reason picked up where Primatech left off and rounds up people with powers. You really think they wanted your boyfriend to stay behind? They're gonna kill him, and if they don't, that's worse. Doing God-knows-what to him while they try to figure out how to turn his powers into a freaking app. You got him killed... and now you're gonna do the same to me. ♪ ♪ [briefcase latches click] [screaming] [grunts] Miko!

Mom, I'm tired of being under house arrest. Why can't I just go out for once? Because you're lying to me. You don't wear your favorite T-shirt to go and play video games. So I'm guessing it's a party, and if you had asked, I might have said yes. Yeah, this is why I didn't tell you, Mom. Because I knew you'd freak out. I just want to hang out with my friends, be normal, or at least act normal for once. I'm sorry. No. Okay? I'll be fine. You're not the only one protecting me now. What does that mean? Someone's been sending me texts, warning me about things. What? Why didn't you tell me about this? Oh, my God, Mom, I-- Who's texting you? I don't know.
